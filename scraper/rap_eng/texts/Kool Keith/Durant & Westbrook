[Hook: Kool Keith]
Auto-tune is back
Got your girl, wanna come see the pro's
Durant & Westbrook
Auto-tune is back
Got your girl up on the dickhead
Sucking the dick now
Professional

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
I'm Durant & Westbrook, you came to help like fish
Because you sound like an unsure, insecure nigga
Bank off your mommy cheeks
Who hear the sneakers squeak
The New Jersey Nets watch me from the scout seats
LeBron called me to come be with the Heat
The organization showing me where I'll be living
A couple of Spanish girls looking on the balcony
With thongs from triple connected suites
The balance is good, J know I'm good for 500 million a year
Cause I stay young, looking like Ray Allen
Off with the mentioning the fat court
Show the rookies how to stop wearing the Citizen and the Seiko Quartz
Cum shot over the female rappers, Spike Lee amazed how I got the shot off
Girls order more hot dogs and pretz', make them run wet
Watch me undercover with Oakley specs
No doubt, auto-tune is back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Metropolis]
Yo, it's Metropolis
They call me grizzy-green, I'm playing position
Pass your 17-year-old daughter
Drink her little body with ice like a cold glass of water
There's no rookie that ever shook me
I'm the baker, the room was full of cookies
I'm in the rat race, confused in labyrinth, quit asking
Metrop' is know to flow with passion
Inspection of the rational
Don't confuse the grains thrown, insanity, that's mathematical
I sound like Rakim, you need tires screaming
My pants open, she's gagging while I'm flown on the Major Deegan
Metrop' is known, next exit is Jerome
You need to take this to the heart and strive
Play your body like Xbox Live
Introducing internet sex
A blunt and Henny and a 4-hour nut, then you next
Only fuck white chicks that's bisexual
I need their brain to be open-minded, intellectual
The street runner
Sexy dope fiends sucking dick, nodding off between two dumpsters

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool Keith]
They're using my past beats
Just to stay on the pants like a crease
Your dime like to get down on one knee
Holding a football for me to kick so smooth
I take a bath while she taking a shit
I'm the new building, New York's tallest
Woman gets soaking wet, panties drenched retarded
Pass off the cream, get comfortable, sleep inside your queen
Your family call me Steve Mc
100%, rappers want to get a fork and eat Steve shit
I know how to plant plants that come up through the horse manure
I gave them the ball, they looking around for an open man like Stuart
Your girl on her stomach with popsicles in her ass
She say I'm the coolest
Two lesbians, I don't mind getting sucked by two lips
Just as long as the one with the bald cap don't act like a man and hate

[Hook]
