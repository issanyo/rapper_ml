[Intro: Sample]
"Doctor, doctor—it's time for you to fuck me now—it's time for you to fuck me—please"

[Verse 1 - Dr Octagon]
Move sideways, my head like a lightbulb
Light up in every club, move your texts
[?] get space dialect
She can't respect, then cash this check
Space in-depth, sitting up in a T-rex
Alien street, I turn those and make a left
UFO, the clothes close with velcro
Norelco, I shave with a backhoe
Strippers want a [?] man showing booty-hole
Platinum records, Space Jam where' it go
Duracell, see the head glow
I’m so future man, you use a hot comb
Xylophone, astronaut in the zone
Night create, we can go and moon shake

[Hook]
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city, lookin' pretty

[Verse 2]
Gasoline gas up, to a full tank
Ebay '67, some vague
[?] earth call me up here
And say I'm wreckless
Throw me in the rights, I intercept this
I'm intersection, scienctific flexes
They study enzymes, I passed erections
Move at the top-down out of all direction
I get the leverage, pull off the levels
I can't descend, I'm up so high
I see the devil grin
Spacecraft come down, they need a little dab
My ship walk up the building like snow crabs
You go Chick-O-Stick, I might break in half
Pull over the star-child, put gas in your ass

[Hook]
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city, lookin' pretty

[Verse 3]
Border free content
I'm the president, equation for
Rhyme through the elephants
Coasting up by saturn is the exit
My patterning are rare blue air view
Silent too, coming up on, breaking noose
[?], automatic insert
Petrolium rap turns, like on patrol
Gravity sea, I'm floating up [?]
Exhibition moonwalk for practise
Exaggerate the scene, cosmetic kinetic
Ultramagnetic brain tech is full
Of rhyming superceded [?] unleaded

[Hook]
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city
Area 54, bright lights, big city, lookin' pretty

[Outro: Sample]
"I'm busy"
