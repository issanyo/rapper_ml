[Intro: Sample + Kool Keith]
"Ultramagnetic MC's—I remember the first time I ever seen Ultramagnetic, at Latin Quarter."
Yeah
It's time to come out and give the people somethin' they can understand
Somethin not too complicated ('cated)
You know what we gon' do?
We gon' bring it down to Earth (Earth)

[Chorus: Listeners]
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Megabomb ignite, super reflection
Power ignites the Fourth Horseman, turbo (hee hee hee hee)
I kick styles like Data, computer reading
Miles away to beam Star Trek
Movin my style up, Optimus level 4
I get it warp speed, youse on my space tour
Get with the elements, eloquent spacecraft
Change my gamma flow, one-three-eight-seven
Twenty-oh-nine-six, cereal silver seven
I got the skills to rap, so what you want Spock?
Style like Captain Kirk, gamma ray one block
Particle leading out, rock the way intercourse
Damaging animals, a lady with menopause
Rising at one speed, altitude X be..
We need some gas or fuel, yo—come in, major!
I'm just a level or pinch, I'm hittin New York
Flyin with Ced, I see the other world
I need some gas, yo Jim, I gotta come down
Perimeter's reading we might crash!!

[Chorus: Listeners]
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!

[Interlude: Kool Keith]
I know you out there and y'all understand
But I'ma let Ced' get on and tell y'all what it's really like
It's not so complicated
But connect with me and y'all follow me right on through!

[Verse 2: Ced-Gee]
Yo, ultra power flowin, get ready for Centron
React with the digital, kicks like loose bombs
High tech C-spects, hit data brain checks
Soundin like John ?, time's up brain TEST
Info storm, locked like SMPTE
Buzzz buzzz buzzz, it's annoying
So pick up kicks and, flex with the mega mega
Square roots on time, so check check check check
And go as I ignite, the energy will unite
FAKE ATTACKS FOR ME, hard as I get hype
T-Minus 7 counts, divided by kilograms
Input outputs, the figure is fluid
But some plug censors, replace it with bass
It's kickin up fiercely, boomin with heat
While you sneakin with energy, sound heat sneaks
The chamber the membrane, delerious insane
Now think about it, hmmmm.. I know it's crazy
With moisture one, and texture seven
The panel's on fire, interference is higher
Delay is in, device is on
Spinnin that plate, proceed this quick
Some bomb it and quit, then give up on life
They just can't handle, the rays of light
They tryin to see, they move the barriers
They catch the enzymes, becomin a carrier
They stop they breathin, they hold they breath
Pass out and soon, then they forget

[Chorus: Listeners]
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!

Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
Bring it down to Earth—I don't understand!
