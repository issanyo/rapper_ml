Check 'em out on the corner, look at 'em
They runnin' with Skeletor
Yo check this out, we gotta do this
I'm double checkin' your girl, I'm smooth, you call me daddy
When I walk out with Charlie Brown and Peppermint Patty
With Linus and Snoopy
These back stage groupies
I kick some style that's fly and show Scoopy Doo
Get the package and give it to Mr. Magoo
They call up Woody Wood, the hit's on the pecker
They cut off his legs with my new shiny Black n' Decker
I load the tech up, I'm bustin' at Shaggy
Space Ghost and Quest, Racer-X, brother Harry
I see Speed, indeed, I tell him what I need
I'm with Charlie Brown and Wolverine smokin' weed
We chillin' with Yogi, the bear, Snoopy playin' poker
Tonight we send out one X-man to kill the Joker
I call up Pigpen, he's with his girl Lucy
With Peanuts on Front Street, he's coming with the Uzi
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skele'
I need more ammo, the RoadRunner, "Beep", he think it's funny
I know his plan I tapped his phone with Bugs Bunny
With Baby-Face Finster, the Wile E Coyote
The money for Rif Raf, the mit that he owe me
They call the office and ran to Dick Tracey
Mumbles at murder trial in court with Ben Casey
I go uptown, my right hand man is Charlie Brown
I call Bullwinkle have him meet up with Bozo the Clown
I'm at the table with Wonder Woman havin' dinner
Mr Ed, you talkin horse, you a real winner
Yo like Beavis, don't laugh, come on Butthead
Where's Felix the Cat, yo Elmer Fudd go and cut head
They runnin' schemes and plots with Fred Flintstone
Ernie and Burt with Desert Eagles on the phone
I call Batman and Robin in the Bat-Mobile
Load up the Bat-Truck with 80 grenades
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skele'
Locked with no key, Inspector, the Gadget in the freezer
I go get Penelope Pitstop, a strip teaser
Then drop the Mack off and make the Riddler back off
I see Tweety Bird, he's bruised on his left jaw
He got jumped by Gremlins, they roll with Skeletor
Makin my way, yo Charlie Brown you drive the Cadillac
Call Big Bird we gonna show them how to act
Go where the train stops
Yo Dino beat Cyclops
I know they comin' tonight, you know they plan
By Goggles Paesano, another mob hit man
We get in, cruise in the ride through New York
Mr. Rogers has left town, his neighbors won't talk
We want to catch him tonight on Sesame Street
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skeletor
I know his boys, yo look, they down with Skele'
Yea Yo Charlie Brown go look in the trunk
Snoopy come on
