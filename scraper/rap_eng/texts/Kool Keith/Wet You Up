Yeah baby

Hello Keith, are you there?
If you're there pick up the phone
Alright baby, I wanted to um
See you tonight after I leave the club
Make sure you get back with me
I'll talk to you soon, bye

I'm on the phone, dialing your number 'cause you my only girl
Exotic lover like a freak from another world
I like your style, your boots and your sex smile
You're a dancer at night, baby that's alright
Shakin' ya thing entertaining in the neon light

Your boss get mad every time I talk to you
Your girl friends laugh, "Go head girl" when I walk with you
And some punks don't know, they can't treat ya good
I'm just the sex champ to hit ya with that good wood

Lay you down and rub my oils all over
I got the stuff to make your honey pot boil over
I give you tips for trips, I like your clam dips
Come and dance slow and wind for the horny pro
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down

Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)

Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)

I see your girl friends dance, but my eye's on you
I give love to sugar brown, you know what to do
Makin' money for the kids or the family home
I understand baby doll why you purr and moan

You walk around the club in sexy underwear
Suckers want too much for nuthin' they don't care
I'm Big Willie home, my plane just arrived from Rome
My Caddy's light green, my rag top is trimmed with chrome

I bought you a present, lingerie, here's a gift
Don't talk with low budget pests, and hell with Nick Swift
I'm the man of your dream, while fools panty scheme
Comin' like Will, Dr. Smith with a laser-beam

Lost in space, no class I got taste
I'm watchin' you now, take your pennies out her face
Here's a 50 there's a lot of people livin' thrifty
I know your stressed, perhaps you do need the rest

You do your job right, but Marvin wants most for less
Back in the cut, he wants to ill again
Who wants a man with 20 cents look like Gilligan

Come here baby escape, you evacuate
Lay up on my shoulders in love and won't hesitate
I come and ease up, walk you through the alley
My girl from the ghetto, not a nerd from the valley
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down

Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)

Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)

It's been some hours waiting for you, your greatest fan
With my fingers in flavor I lick your juices off my hand
You bump and grind and wind, I know that hottie's mine
Sippin' on some Seagrams, the Smith's see his girl is fine

When it's time to close, who be lickin' toes
I'm in this piece, while you flashin' for them average joes
You rubbin' heads and chairs in no mattress beds
Beauty queens on stage, her friends look like thorough-breds

Tryin' lean on the green, ya sista's 19
Tell her watch out, them fake pimp's 'ill make her panties cream
You goto college workin' hard for your PHD
Then come home and give your soft skin, your love to me

They don't know I'm in the place peepin' out the show
Drinkin' Heinkens, the green bottles Beck's style
Put on your leather and come and learn the next style
Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down

Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)

Let me wet you up, honey slide 'em down
(Slide 'em down)
Let me wet you up, rub it all around
(Rub it all around)

C'mon baby, c 'mon baby
Woo, woo, woo baby, woo, woo, woo baby
I want to rub you up baby, I want to rub you baby
I want to lick you up baby, I can't wait to lick you up baby
