[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
It's time to spit on shit, a lot of dudes faking like they don't rap
They secret rap like a sneaky-type push broad
Behind your back, from your corner by myself, my hands spread like Novac
Perimeter working like you feel like your left knee ain't working
Scoop off the pain inside, you faint inside
I'm not looking for an injury collide
Just Allstate to cover the mischievous
Two hand, guess where the green ball at
We know that, we mean all that, you [?] all brat
Your girl said my dick is a phone
She hang up and call back, ask gorilla-face Laface
I'm judging X-Fac's, whether you like it or not
If you slim, why your bitch trying to rock a girdle strap

[Hook: Kool Keith]
Monkey sun, monkey runs
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey clap, monkey clap

[Verse 2: Kidricc James]
What's your name, fool K-i-d r-i c-c J-a m-e s, yes, I'm so fresh
Watch me diminish this lyrical nemesis, since I was playing Sega Genesis
Ciroc mixed with Tropicana Twist
I got killers who train gorillas with banana clips
Smoke your ass like cannabis, with the tool I keep
But I sit back, relax, keep it cool like Keith
See, I'm climbing to the top like I was King Kong
She on my ding-dong, because my thing long
My pinky finger is the one I keep my ring on
Mack when I talk, when I walk, they play my theme song
I'm from Houston, Texas, the state where the horses and the cattle at
Country rap tunes, fuck a battle rap
Leather seats and candy-painted Cadillac
Now, motherfucker, can you handle that

[Hook: Kool Keith]

[Verse 3: Willie B Baller]
Shots before I come back, this ain't no monkey clap
Donkey Kong [?], I need that
Bun fun, bun tie, bend her back
Put the lighter in my strap, cock it back
Pussy, bust a monkey claps, they caught up in my bear trap
Once I'm squeezed, I pulled a mustang out the hat
Her kid ain't home, if he was, we'll still be alone
Daddy say, daddy do, mommy ooh
She got a fattie too, the monkey clap, what it do
Ass up on her stomach is the best moves
Voulez vous coucher avec moi ce soir
I ain't on no monkey bars, we sweating once we dry, it's the aqua
Medusa and claps, yeah the door not ignored
That coke ki', not a hurricane, got me on
After the party is the speakeas', hit ménage à huit
6 chicks, me and Kool Keith

[Hook: Kool Keith]

Monkey clap
