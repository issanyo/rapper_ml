Hey, where you going?
Going to the library
You read books?
Oh yeah..

Who can stop the porno-vision?
Testicles ready, penis already went through circumcision
Heavy competition, vocals just got out of the house of detention
Governor linebacking with the gold strap I play ball for Clinton
I'm like a dog chasing my own tail, spinning Dr. inclined
Jacked off in the mothership, pass the chip off the Funkenstein
The red dots ran over football players at the field goal line
Juicy inside, the girls like when I orange peel off their mind
If you can see ghosts I'm Shawn Carter in his prime
Whipit to stadium, leather seat inclined
Superstar like Ernest Borgnine

Chorus:
Dr. Octo, art like Picasso
Operation zero
Orchestrate material
Dr. Octo, art like Picasso
Operation zero

Enter the Pentagon
Stain like a blood cloth
You see me with flashlights walking through the fog
Women with newspaper peeing hard
Eyeballs get wide, everything grey and large
Master charge hold the condom with a iPod
Brain massage through my prostate, oh my god
Frank Fallujah see inside pink fuschia
DNA drop the birth control on computer
You wait for x-rays having sex with a neck brace
She on the autobahn speeding with a tampon
Hexagon, pulling over whilst she drinking a john
I'm Don Juan, catching panties like Lynn Swann
I'm a fan of Spawn
Shock writer long johns, i need the lexicon
Walk inside with leprechaun, green and more
Jellybeans we want more

Dr. Octo, art like Picasso
Operation zero

Even let go of these mics, Pandora's box
I wear a moose with lime green fox
Tires look like Hydrox
White shoes with black socks
Mountain dew recorded vocals with the chicken pox
Pots on the stove, smoking can't turn shaking knobs
Packed her bags, moving out the bodybags
Freckle faced up, popping an electric boogie
Pedal behind trucks you see the black hoodie
Break coke with the antidote
I'm hunting antelope
Sitting up at night time in goggles eating cantaloupe
Making left and rights, seeing people with tights
Ballerina's legs and wings i'm the Colonel from Kentucky Fried
The doctor wears his tux with a lot of pride


Dr. Octo, art like Picasso
Operation zero
