Yo Keith B, they got your phones tapped
They got he camera's everywhere
Yo your whole joint is under surveillance
But I was peepin' it out and yo, I think I can fix it
Know what I'm saying
Let me get busy, then we can get busy

I'm still the player, the mayor, the street corner government
Increase my growth, my style is dap, so intelligent
Fierce with diamonds and rings sparkle on my finger
I pose with Ho's, my Lager and my Feld Linger

The big casino, with mega loot like Al Pacino
Sharing stocks and trading bonds with the whole Gambino
Rosa Maria pass me the pizza
For girls who front I tell 'em hasta la vista

Riding with the stupid funk, is it real?
My trunk full of Mack Ten's, grenades made of steel
I got more cash then Clinton, pay off the FBI
My game top notch, the phantom known slick and sly

I got a house in LA, and one in New York
Snitches around, I must be careful when I talk
I got the number to call Elizabeth Taylor
My movie star girl friend, my mobile home trailer

You call your lawyer, let's handle make a settlement
It's time for business, your man got to step back

It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back

Closing deals on Capitol Hill, I spin the wheel
I shock point blank range, just like a street electric eel
I chew your face off, just like a great white shark
Atomic lights on, my Caddy bouncin' in the dark

Through 125 and down another live street
You in Hollywood, neon lights shine on Vine Street
I ride around see my jealous type enemies
Some friends of mines on drugs and bad memories

Sammy L and Teddy's back sniffin' cocaine
They die from heart attacks with bullets in they brain
I keep rollin' with the phantom face cryin'
Laughin' and gigglin' while everybody's dyin'

Who told you open that tube and try to sniff the glue?
You in emergency, the room is turnin' dark blue
With black potion, I look into the ocean
My fast life style is watchin' you in slow motion

You got the ketchup, you standing with no french fries
Marked for death, with glasses on your dirty eyes
I don't know in Jackie's bar who killed Mr Green
I was home with my girl friend named Bernadine

Don't try to pin it on me, come on Ben Casey
I'm workin' 9 to 5, the fed's think i'm lazy
I know my game, I'm mad freaky undercover
Exotic psycho, and California panty lover

I see the news and blood drippin' from my shoes
He messed up money jack, i'm not the one to pay his dues

It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back

It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back

Now detectives appear they want a firm investigation
They tappin' my white phone for secret information
I get no sleep accumulatin' millions in a week
I walk by, you think I'm blind and I never speak

I see you scopin' my eye in the back of my head
Two blocks away, yo look around, now he's dead

Everybody's scheme is all vanilla ice cream
I catch you on the highway, put on my high beam
You see voodoo, you drop doo doo and a man appear
Happy birthday, goodbye in your last year

As I stand by your Hearst with the black coffin
You been sinning, winning, and flirting with the devil often
I hold the spirits, the songs to the murder case
No time for demons, don't step up in the phantom face

It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back

It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
It's time for business, your man got to step back
