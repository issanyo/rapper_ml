Yo Keith, let me tell you sumthin' son
Rap is big business
They been signin' whack M.C.'s
Since the beginnin' of time
It's been goin' on and it continues goin' on

I'm Rhythm X, Kool Keith, Papa Large same time the Phantom
Four People in one, sometimes I can stand 'em
My lyrics spark the world on a station in your program
Girls get wild, this ain't no slimy corny slow jam

I walk around sometimes in Santa Cruz
California and drop the funky news
The kids flowin' with speed like Jesse Owen
Mexican girls, I love 'em mixed with Samoan

I go cruz up the west goin' ta Oakland Town
Passin' Fremont, the caddy runnin' Oakland bound
I turn a right an' make a left on a nice block
No time for drugs, cocaine and a nice rock

I might lean to the side like I'm super fly
Smoke no skag, I'm bugged and a super guy
I might flip out, my attitude change
People in America, whoo they think I'm strange

I'm not no regular man or the average man
I might trip-out, sometimes I think I'm Batman

You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it

I read my comic books, I bring my cartoons to life
Gangsters and immortals, they can bleed with a knife
I straight bug 'em my way, they live their fantasy
I seen wilder stuff, what they tellin' me?

That's just an act from them, they in a studio
Wildin' on wax and perpetratin' in they video
I hate to look at TV, I'm gettin' sleepy
They grabbin' Dr Dre's sound, tryna get sneaky

I see my style so different, they can't take it
2 million rappers and everybody wants to make it
4 thirds are whack and stop and clog the industry
You wanna sign him? To me, I think he sound like pee

I was dissed and insulted at the Gavin
800 whack M.C.'s
(Huh, huh)
They kept me laughin'
Playin' and perpetratin', you thinkin' and debatin'
All this time, no one and still has awakened

You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it

Flight in, flight out, every single night out
Lookin' at people jumpin' you puppets with no clout
I got no deal in that part, no half a second movie
I stay down low, my music touch still groovy

I look at contracts what's up with Warner Brothers?
My day on the sliver screens, with condoms and more rubbers
You bet your socks again, this Bronx kid rocks again
Smokin' that blunt, your black lungs need oxygen

Who you cool with, and stupid who you fool with?
Never mind my mental friend I went to school with
My style is pro, connectin' to a confessional
Breakin' it down like tiny parts in a mineral

I chill and watch MC's, they don't see me
2 hundred 80 million, a thousand try to be me
Yo company's are dumb, bum's signin' anythin'
In the long run, you're stuck with a chicken wing

Wastin' your money these acts they can't rhyme
You're dealin' with cornflakes, a lemon head an lime
Everybody's mean and walkin' up on the scene
They're pure bacon, a brand new pack of sizzle lean
I hate to walk on over and pull and pick your file
Like a bandit i wear a mask and vic your style

You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it

You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it
You know the game, this time they gotta play it

Yeah, I hear what you sayin' man
You just gotta keep on doin' what you doin'
With all these people runnin' the game
You just gotta play the game

Goldy know about that
You should know that too
Think about the real player
