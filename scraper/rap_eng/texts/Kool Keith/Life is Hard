[Chorus]
Everybody wanna write
Everybody wanna write “life is hard” rap
“Life is hard” rap
Everybody wanna write “life is hard” rap
Everybody wanna rap
“Life is hard” rap
(Life is hard)

[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna write their “life is hard” raps
I can’t believe they still doin’ it
That’s why I pee on that crap
Go to the mall and find a [?] ski hat
I’m about watchin’ your woman twerk while you spit in gritty
Your baby got back, my reflection bounce off her hair tracks
My connection got her pushin’ the whip to slide in her softness
Her girlfriend like it with one knee up in the office
Your man in electrical power shortages
Breakfast, you love your erotic sausages
Red and grey Bentley convertible
Deep massages
You know you low in the marshmallow seats where your favourite sports ball is
The way you open your mouth and scream for the kids
Drink the milkshake, don’t be ashamed what you see, Dee Dee
Your mommy give me the keys to the crib
Lamp with the socks off, with the boxes
A&W Root Beer
What you handin’ me?
Some cubes to go with my Mr. Pibb?

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna write
Everybody wanna write “life is hard” rap
“Life is hard” rap
Everybody wanna write “life is hard” rap
Everybody wanna rap
“Life is hard” rap
(Life is hard)

[Verse 2]
No matter how much y’all depress me with wooden hood stories
I’mma hand out issues and make it circulatory
Who you ever choose to bore me
Do so
My words sink in your lady’s earlobes
She hurry up and change into see-through feminine attire
When she get home
I make her cut toenails with precision
The magnum she talk when it’s snug fit in (?)
Make a woman who like women wanna witness
All I need is ginseng and citron citrus
January, Feb, you get a baby before Christmas
Rub ‘em more, I can do this
Just because you’re fine, don’t mean I’mma go for you
Bite on the end of the rod
You wanna start a war
And get your family involved

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna write
Everybody wanna write “life is hard” rap
“Life is hard” rap
Everybody wanna write “life is hard” rap
Everybody wanna rap
“Life is hard” rap
(Life is hard)
