[Kool Keith]
The introduction, format format
("I have a valid message, stand by to authenticate")

Robotic contract is my verbal attack
Verbal abstract, flexible choice, operation flexible voice
Orchestrated one, detonator son
Sci-fi numbers, the megabyte is a ton
Super Thelonious colossal apostle, organic feedback
Chart system, can scientists read that?
Fertilized growth or breed back clones for zones
Space 8000 circumfrence, a billion measure
The Earth caresser
Space 8000 circumfrence ability and measure
The Earth caresser

Space 8000! ... Space 8000!
("Again a man from the future attacks!")
Space 8000! ("Again a man from the future attacks!")
Space 8000! ("Again a man from the future attacks!")

("T minus 15, 14, 13..")

My forces of energy is hexagonal
Diagonal, outer lining the inner term from chemists
Redefine the vocab, go and do the research
A lot of rewinding devestation source
We speed ahead of light more, see elevations like Porsche
Gas electric beyond the oil lamp like a torch
Atmosphere four, through the corridor
That's right it splintered, parallel Western the seashore
Goretex extradition you ready for position
Space 8000 circumfrence
Space 8000 circumfrence ability and measure
The Earth caresser, yeah!

Space 8000!
Space 8000! ("Again a man from the future attacks!")
Space 8000! ("Again a man from the future attacks!")
Space 8000! ("Again a man from the future attacks!")
Space 8000!

With heavy symmetrical industrial and various impetuous construction
With adventurous introduction
Ears absorb the mechanisms like suction
E-force miles away, detour styles away
Cosmic energy, four million chromosomes on eBay
Ships on galaxies cruise the hemisphere on space delay
Brains record and play, elevation existance
Above sealevel, fibers and metal
Way above E-level
The underground right now's on C-level
Space 8000 circumfrence
Space 8000 circumfrence
Ability and measure, the Earth caresser

Space 8000!
Space 8000! ("Again a man from the future attacks!")
Space 8000! ("Again a man from the future attacks!")
Space 8000! ("Again a man from the future attacks!")

"Look at all that Jennifer, WHOAH~!
My missiles are headed for their targets"
"David this is neat but, I gotta get to my aerobics class"
"What? Awww nooo!"
"I have to! Can't we just stop for a while and play it later?"
"Together?"
"Huh? Oh, sure. I'll walk you out"
"Thanks"
"Let me just turn this off"
