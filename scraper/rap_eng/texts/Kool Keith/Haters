Two-thousand-three baby, Kool Keith, I'm up in here
Very different - and he wants to talk to you
Admire his immaturity

Took you away to better places
Brazil, Costa Rica you seen new faces
Covered the bills you struggled to pay - gave you life
No more kid with a scarf around his beatin you up every day
Plastic surgery breast implants the small hustler made you cry
Because he was confused, you lay while he play
Cleanin my house, you look gorgeous in lingerie
Is that the kid on the phone? Hardcore
Hawkin you in front of the building everyday
When is he gonna learn? It's over, it's my turn
You're pregnant with my kid
By the fireplace, we watch his doo-rags burn
I remodeled you, gave you the diamonds he couldn't wisely concern
Always talkin bout the cash he got
The little pesos for shows
And God knows his materialistic raps and wack flows
Are like Stay Free pads, fake V.I.P. rappers get garbage disposed
Unrecouped for his flamboyance and reflection
He's leasin rentin and frontin - yeah, yeah..

Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!

Stop the chorus back to your Bentley
Your wife is gone, she's with me
On a first class flight in the Bahamas, grab your bags quickly
Sorry top ten rapper on the answering machine
You're over like Al Green
This song is written for the 2003 team
V.I.P. with Ben Vareen
Cancel your A&R meeting light you up like Heatwave - central heating
Eject your premature CD in the whirlpool while we're eating
Shut down all material, new tracks fall on your head like a crane
All you offered to women is sound of weak drums
Fill they hearts with pain
I'm in your dungaree jacket like a bleach stain
Girls cry on my arm, he was cheap and silly don't complain
He's a nerd with a hardcore twist, playin with racing cars
We look out the window and count the rain on the window pane
(Count the rain on the window pane)

Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!

Here's a tissue for the tears
He gave you hard times over hard rhymes for years
Shattered your career
Like an uncomfortable thong twisted in your rear
He was eight years behind, I was already advanced, I've been here
Denim suits with alligators
Your man sports black all the time with no flavors
From castle to castle, hassle to hassle
House to house, man to mouse (man to mouse)

Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
Haters come around from downtown
I get surround sound - I get big!
