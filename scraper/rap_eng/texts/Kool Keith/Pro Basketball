[Verse:]
Oh yeah
Now it’s time to adjust the toilet stool
Adjust the toilet stool on them motherfuckers
It’s time to take the shit on
I breaking their heart soles down
For so much they could shit fire
Piss on your mouth now you can’t spit fire
JJ Paraya got you [?] over tire
You [?] hold my dick
Why you think I was quiet
To come into the league and keep ya’ll quiet
Put a baby in Mya till ya’ll call my sire
BMX mini bike with them tiny legs
Step back ya’ll not motorcycle riders
Ya’ll fucking with aspirin suppliers
Ricky from the factory
Ya’ll driving in Oscar Meyers
Crack for the cartels
Radio pump lyrical liars
African castration in Zairie
Foreskin pulled back from the forehead
We got circumcised by Sanaa
Sitting in you Phantom in shitty draws
I’m so arrogant you change my diaper
I play the role like Mekhi Phifer
I’m a diarrhea writer
Cosign, off beat, a piss reminder
Mcs put the shit out
My ass in the grinder
And whip it up till it turn cream
Lucky charms make your girl shit light green
Tell your crew come try for the strip team
The prom just arrived, i’m only 16
On top of the world
You got to see the hand for
And the panther full of shit
Cadillac 12 lean
You fucking with the martinis
Ask anybody rapping about dizzy dean
Break you down into body parts
Come see the supreme
Though you should not shake of to the parlour
Cover you down with bald spots
Mcs with crooked legs
Malnutrition
You got that mom that sport that wig
You miss me
Big chuck come wipe my ass for me
That’s the last you see
That sonogram, x-rated bitch
In the fleet with broham
Grand central station you fucking with grams
Come on yo, get out the demands
Honey I’ll pull over and get the contact
We can play nba
Call me back
I’ll sign the 20 million dollar contract
That’s just for the one year
With a two year option
Fuck that, I’m rockin
Yeah, you know how it is
The NBA finals
You know like scoring all on top of shit
Just going to the basket
Sitting on top of the rim
Shittin inside the rim
Harming that basketball
Turning 6 & 7 times in the air
Just going up on motherfuckers
Let me slip the balls
While i’m just cuffin that ball
Just going in strong with dunks
You know, with sneakers on
Just going to the key
Getting inside the paint
Just jumpin
Just leaping like 80, 7000 ft
Of air on these motherfuckers
Showing em that ability
Yeah
Then after that
It’s back to the locker room
For some Champagne
Then we take the showers
Then we get ready to go outside
Some guys go their way, I go mine
Then it’s back to the motherfucking arena
Pro, that’s pro
Now you know[x3]
