[Kool Keith]
I'ma take these ward, Ultramagnetic release the vinyl
And competitor's limo drivers come to the Bronz from Connecticut
A legacy that was born, since KRS and Scott LaRock
The flow is hard to jock, with the formula
Who can stop the UG controllers from droppin bombs on the block?
These guys really think they stars on the block
I move in right after ya, sign your shit like Metallica
You would think I came with drums and a band
When the crocodile step on your drawings you wouldn't understand
You would become a remodeled fan
It's time to let America know you tell Uncle Sam we jam

[Chorus]
Mechanism nice - mechanism, mechanism, mechanism, mechanism
Reincubated - mechanism nice, born twice
Mechanism nice, reincubated
Born twice

[Kool Keith]
It's like nobody compensatin and changin the movement structure
The operation is far in your mind
How many telescopes you bring in like the Jurassic Park
Dinosaur, I'm not dyin no more
We headlinin Dave Matthews tour
Don't sleep cause y'all be layin with the jab, from judo on the floor
With bad news more, I can spot bad news whore
By the yappin of the jaw
The funky drummer, wouldn't buy the underwear in the drawer
Underwear, underwear

[Chorus]
Mechanism nice! Me-cha-ni-sm
Mechanism nice! Reincubated - reincubated, born twice
Mechanism nice! Born twice

[Ced Gee]
Now we did shows with the Masters of Ceremonies
Rakim and Eric B
The Wu-Tang Clan to MC Shan
And of course the cats from around my way, Boogie Down Productions
Otherwise known as BDP
Rooftop, Latin Quarters
Union Square, Disco Fevers
From the hardest clubs to the biggest arenas
Over a billion people have been blessed to have seen us
From Princeton to Amsterdam, France to "O! Canada"
We get love around the world
We didn't need any management to handle us
On the tour bus, snappin and rappin
With the Big Daddy Kane, Kool G. Rap
My man DJ Polo, Positive K
And of course I can't forget the Scoob and Scrap
The realest of the realniks, cats who had your back
Stealin shit from Arby's, with tons of cash in our backpacks
Yeah

[Chorus/Outro]
Mechanism nice! Me-cha-ni-sm
Mechanism nice! Reincubated - reincubated, born twice
Mechanism nice! Born twice
Mechanism nice! Me-cha-ni-sm
Mechanism nice! Reincubated - reincubated, born twice
Mechanism nice! Born twice
Mechanism nice!
Mechanism nice!
