Hey, Dr. Octagon
You know how it is
When you're in the bathtub
I'm there, to give you the Oil of Olay
To rub it all over your head
Dr. Octagon, proctologyst, lyrical scientist
Women know my twist
When I release the hits
There's no one on the invitation guest list
Organic kilometer, you feel the temperature
Playing with the advisor
I take the advice, opposite Mr. Nice
Bone you twice we hear it
The funkology astrology
Lookin out the space window with the Bryants
I wear the Kobes
Not takin the space route, duplicate me
Like Moby, you don't know me

[Hook: singing]
Dr. Octagon
Dr. Octo
Dr. Octagon

[Kool Keith]
Operation X-Factor with the Wolverine
Walkin down Broadway with the X-Men
Women close your eyes
You see the green "Lost in Space" ship, count to 10
The first android landed from the Mercury
Nobody on Earth shock me
Your Earth music don't hurt me
We park the bus
... and grab the bags
Robot, me
Comin down the street
Dr. Smith and Will Robinson and Dawn
A baby chimpanzee with fur coat
Speed's older brother Racer X
Drinkin Dom P in the passenger seat

[Kool Keith]
With chemicals all over my pants
The discotheque won't let me in the dance
Original gas, computer built into my shoes
Reject the circumstance
A flying elephant with metal wings
Pulling up in Domino's
Me and Batman and the Rhino just left Spider-Man
Smokin PCP in the don room
With 2 Asian models, Aunt Bee, Barney Fife
Just a new distribution deal, with Jive
I got a new job workin in a band
With Elmer Fudd drivin a van
For the Channel 5 news, rouse
