[Verse 1: Kool Keith/Crazy Lou]
Infinite infantries, space techs banana clips
Skin penetration, directions information
Roll up your knuckles, get blast in your fingertips
Phasers with macs and handles clamped up on your hips
Infrared beams so sharp crease your pant seams
Winchester barrels I sold them at the Christmas carols
With small scopes from miles adjust them to your house
With see through Glocks, that's natural, you load with rocks
Front vinyl holsters some acid pellets from the box
Big tanks that's German Spanish thoughts I be servin
More beggars in trucks, shippin weight to Las Vegas
Bicentennial bombs with leather straps for your arms
Garments and bags from hefty, I'm a lefty

[Hook: Kool Keith/Crazy Lou]
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
You're welcome

[Verse 2: Kool Keith/Crazy Lou]
Nuke 'em headbands for light blue German Lugars
Forcefields protect, razor bumps behind your neck
Automatics from seven chambers eighty-two bullets
When you pull it the little twenty five sound like Ganas
Machine guns electric cords rob the power run
Remington 870, for the pedigree
Night time militant mask, fueled with laser gas
Atomic ACP thirty round American slugs
With bugs undefeatable navy systems
Brown pearls pistols with FBI whistles
Suitcase with missles stashed with toilet tissues
Triggers with frames or 44 that shoot flames
Law enforcement, I got the first kill endorsement
Uzis material eatin Cocoa Puff cereal
Close range spokers, infrareds let you notice
Factory parts here screws with the custom parts
Deputy badges, fake SWAT teams closin gasses
Blow up your asses, over here put on masses

[Hook: Kool Keith/Crazy Lou]
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
You're welcome

[Verse 3: Kool Keith/Crazy Lou]
Antagonist columnist, astrotech abuser
85 rounds of dynamite sticks with mix
On old rifles, and little derringers that fix
LAPD can't see me, I wear a Muslim beanie
Indian transporter, machine guns across the border
And Siberian bolts bullet proof winter coats
Across the region, duffel bags on the major deacon
Station wagons with desert eagles to stop a dragon
Elephant darts with propane travel through the rain
Bust back, the right machine to counteract
Carbine 31 shot wake up the project block
Neighborhood with wood, blast off the D off the hood
Bounty hunters with camoflague green alligators
Straight from the Barbados, chewin' sweet potatoes
Jamaican passport with hand grenades that I bought

[Hook: Kool Keith/Crazy Lou]
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World
Welcome to Weapon World

[Outro: Kool Keith/Crazy Lou]
That's right
Has the effect to put a six-foot gorilla
With the skin of an alligator
Aluminum!
With the aluminum skin of an alligator
To a 4 point 8 Pterodactyl
That's a Dragon Plus... with a twist
