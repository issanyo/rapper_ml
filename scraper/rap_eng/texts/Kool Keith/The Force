[Intro: Kool Keith]
I am the force [x5]

[Verse: Kool Keith]
You know I'm thunderbirds one through five
Super mechanism rocker, show hopper
Rain dropper on the moon, bank robber
See my atmosphere rocket ship park in your rear
With aviation altercation spacecraft
Ready for takeoff with motivation
I'm leaving rap on the ground for space station
Kiss earth and land goodbye, I'm an astronaut
Going on vacation, above private jet
Me and your captain haven't met yet
The general carrying alien boxes up to the galaxy with chemicals
The dark side, with Sergeant Pluto, we sitting in a dark ride
We're flight jackets, we're U.S. RV, we're Tim McGarvey
No time for explanation for toys, we're big boys
No Ken and Barbie, just Robotron coming up the turnpike
With flying saucer lights on
Neck with a platinum pipe on
Aluminum snake make you do the shake shake
American Airline cook for us, we sponsor everything we bake
Getting out of Mercedes
Talking to the president with the U.S. Navies
Potato salad for the soldiers, everybody get they gravies
I am the force

(Marines, please step back because)
I am the force
(Army, please step back because)
I am the force
(US Navy, please step back because)
I am the force
(National Guard, please step back because)
I am the force
(All the space stations, step back because)
I am the force
(Newscasters, please step back because)
I am the force
(New York City Police Department, please step back because)
I am the force

Please step back because
I am the force

[Outro: Kool Keith]
General crunk tank, blow out your trunk (salute)
