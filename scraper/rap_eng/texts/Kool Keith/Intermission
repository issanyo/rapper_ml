Artist: UltraMagnetic M.C.'s
Album:  Funk Your Head Up
Song:   Intermission

[Kool Keith]

Ahhh... it's time to relax
For all the people out there, it's time to take a break
A little intermission
Go urinate, get a little popcorn, stuff like that

[Ced Gee]

Ahh yeah, or get that quart of Old Gold
Or a banana

[Kool Keith]

If you wanna jerk off or two
Anything you know

[Ced Gee]

Or a cup of coffee
Whatever turns you on, take that break
Yeahhh...
And right about now

[Kool Keith]

We're going back to the funk!
