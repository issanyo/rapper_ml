[Applause]

[Chorus:]
Wheelchair Beast[x6]

[Verse 2:]
I’m a skinhead walking around with a Black leather jacket
A black dog losing his hair cause his tail is wagging
Got the coat long to the floor
Garlic from pizza coming through my pores
My girl work in a hearse
She shows people on funeral tours
Cook tahini at night in a nightgown
For handicap nigga that’s stay over the house
You wear hospital alertness trousers
Wait for him to cash that goddamn check
He got disability power
He dance with one leg, with crutches in the shower
He’s a beast in the projects the kids love him
The cops bug him
Cats they try to mug him
Amputated arms
He played drums with no arms
Holding sticks with nubs
Kids say “Mommy where his fingers got cut off”

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Slick wid it
Amazons and bangers and lizards
Bunting your crew, pick twizzlers
Long legged thingy broads with Day’o with the Stars
It’s persistent
Fall out the gang
Lose every digit
Moschino misfits
Sweaters from Bally's in Switzerland
Disappear in Thailand
Find me with 30 freaks in a hotel missing
I feel more about different bitches
Different attitudes
Slip silk, flip the angle
How I planned it
Have the game choked out and strangled
Until you not stressing to comprehend my mission
Nigga I switch up and replace you with a meatball Italian broad
Draped and collecting again
Keith it true the flow about the wheelchair
I feel for exquisite women, diva perfume and pretty hair
And eyes like flares
Gucci girl
Maybelline eyeshadow
Full body wax and
Elizabeth Arden mascaro
Get my attention, don’t be fooled
Your toe ring could incite me and make me drool
I’m disgusted to the nature
I’m a male chauvinist, the best alpha male
Hit me on my gmail

[Chorus]
