[Intro: Kool Keith]
Yeah you don't have to play this on a Tuesday night
But check this out, this is Sunday morning in church
With the brother, the Godfather
Open up the testaments, and let us read this
This ain't no Flintstone and no Bedrock type stuff
Check it out
(Time to flip the scriptures!)

[Chorus]
Checkin my style, return to zero
Checkin my style, return to zero
Checkin my style, return to zero
Checkin my style, return to zero

[Verse 1]
Well I keep a style in tomes, on my job and microphone
Mik-make my flows, show a rapper what I give them
Don't flex funky yo, kick it honey step back
Watch when I come, you scratch that kitty-kat on top of that
Rappers know I'm X, slow down, watch me get stupid open
Dance for the ladies, I strip in Chippendale's
Funky hypo, or technical, lyrics make computer
With a brain that spins like Kid Capri, 33
Drop a 45 down just like the first record rotate
My style, my rhyme, my game is droppin doo-doo lyrics
Make a brother say, "Keith is out? Damn, I wanna hear it"
Buy a copy tomorrow, kick his old tape
Take it back two times to smack his girl, let him go
Tell his uncle brother aunt and Cousin Belle (Ding-Dong!)
As I rock so well, spanki'n tail, check the beats
My style is so early, you couldn't catch it on Bobbito
As I flaunt and I stretch just like a rubber bandâ€”poppin'!
Stoppin every rapper like a trooper on a turnpike
I'm long and strong and just like the Lincoln Tunnel
'Father, big up, check it out
Back back, I switch switch, I check check, I know that
Bored as I kick up, you proud of me you know it's me
I got more muscle to flex to show than Jodeci
Take off them panties, I turn Boyz II Men

[Chorus]
Checkin my style, return to zero
Checkin my style, return to zero
Checkin my style, return to zero
Checkin my style, return to zero

[Outro]
Yeah! We want all them rappers out there
To check they styles and come back and return to zero
(Yeah, what you need?)
I don't need Bootsy Collins
I don't need Central Line
I don't need Roger Troutman
I don't need Zapp
I don't need Junior
I don't need Chic
I don't need Sister Sledge
I don't need Pop
I don't need Bohannon
I don't need Led Zeppelin
I don't need Anthrax
I just need what I need
