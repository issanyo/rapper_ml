-Word, keeping it down

Call me maverick, have a quick drama draw
Uphold the hip hop lord, came out like the bomb armed to explode
Multi-levitating, meditating, no mistakes the next plan takes shape
Cash you mouth fast, cut up stacks like me Cleeves
Rum and drinking Beefeater Gin, sip the Bristol
Pack a Pistol, macadamia with damn witches from mesopotamia
Camouflage, espionnage, entourage, extra large
