[Intro: Sample]
"What's your theory, Doctor?
Strangulation by terrifically powerful hands
But it's peculiar that this left deltoid muscle should be missing
It's been torn right out
Gentlemen, it wasn't torn. This is cannibalism!"

[Verse 1: Dr. Octagon]
Your organic medical talk propels off my arms
The atom bomb final Lionel Richie not couth for this battle
I rattle, sing sing sing like bing bing bing
Ricochet Rabbit, grab it, lock up, pop up
Watch you jam like Autechre, with old energy it's me
Lyrically bionically you're panicked B
You end up and nobody is home as I react
Fertilizing your chrome, dome boils sore medicated
All flows rose and have a tweakin' speakin'
Puerto Rican the powerful machine gun stun
Ba-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum, ambulance, lights bright
Paramedics FedEx your legs with eggs chicken hatch
Can't find two they dead ex, but the skin don't match

[Hook: Dr. Octagon]
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold


[Verse 2: Sir Menelik]
Bio-production is greatly increased, magnetic fields
Velocity of projectiles, electro-liquid experiments
Theoretical observances and critical procedures, cool
To seventy-seven Kelvins by submerging steel cylinders
Secure capacitated it in the cryogenic containing the crude samples
One millimeter in diameter
Since the last explosion, December 3rd, 1992
Reinforce mixing copper nickel-beryllium oxide
Concentric layers, proportional carbon density of the radian
It is therefore existent if it does not produce contradictory statements
Or quantum wave functions, mechanic mind out of matter
This behaviour is accompanied by conscious experience
Remains as perplexing as ever
Ask Copernicus about pushing limits

[Hook: Dr. Octagon]
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold

[Verse 3]
Like a twenty-five pep-a-pep-pep- pellets, BB guns
Will stun buns, kickin' up dirt dust, must you see me
Hittin' like beepers, beep beep, vibrate
Take swift shake swift with myth while you smoke a spliff
Change strange and detour fought more
Minds with signs of minds on 8 by 10
Class when atomic lines
You keepin' deep thought by but my planet court
Rehearsal is a must, lest my vital is a point to fuss
My inhabitants, past tense
Ever since Presidents
Lyndon B., Jerry, John, George and Carter like Optimus
Diesel reflects auto starter
Megatron, rejuvenate!

[Hook]
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold
And you say, no awareness
Swift as gold

[Verse 4: Sir Menelik]
Edge, dislocation specifically, opportunity to form
And ultimately fail, under stress depends on science immobile
Epoxy or stock composites
New conductors maximum amp use much finer filaments
Eighteen percent of volume minus three six nine degrees
Celsius, a record for resistive electromagnets
A hybrid design, seven-hundred thirty-thousand gauss
For all types of DC residents absorbtion
Flowing through fifteen-thousand one-hundred watt lightbulbs
Tremendous heat is generate, driven by direct
But not oscillating, current
Extremely powerful, fascinating
Engineering reflections, acoustic depth by analysis
Vulnerable to legal challenge
High exposure requires mental protection, replica
Artificial dynamic Microsoft tech
Heavy black cables, Nova robot demanding battery power
Acids found in drosophilia, the master gene
