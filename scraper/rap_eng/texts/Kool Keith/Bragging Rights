[Verse 1 - Kool Keith]
Blue phantom with the chrome hood
Your girl call me black foot
Piss out the window watch your urine bounce off your face
Last night at the Sheraton, Kenya Moore came up with white lace
Private visitor playing your girl like Witchita
Sit in the Bugatti with your girl and I co-park it
You ain't down for switching her
Denise Rossi type of tongue in her booty but they conservative
Tom Ford spread on my cock
I know you heard of this, introduced your wife to CK Shock
Manage Lady Gaga, after nine months I could turn Rihanna's baby pop
Queen Harrison give birth, ready to drop
What you know about the pastelle Lamborghini with the matte navy tires ready to roll up to shop
Your lady want butterscotch
Ice cream on the crotch
Rolex ten million, your girl see the watch
Twelve bottles, they call me Jon Sparks
No kin to Starks
I got rappers selling for me in Central Park
Jon King's oldest brother
Y'all still sipping day old Sutter
The mink coat melt of my shoulder like butter
[?]
I look like the Ohio players when I play synth

[Verse 2 - Psycho Les]
I'm a P.I.M.P, a M.A.S.T
E.R. of this rap shit you must be a retard
Steeping to me, a keef
You got crazy beef
Our shit is rugged, you can't bite this with baby teeth
So pour the liquor slow
For the gigolo
And yo homie, your bitch want to blow me like a piccolo
I ain't the jealous type like that
And after she swallow I send your wife right back
Newly wed, watch out now, I'm bagging wipes
With wedding rings at the party, flashing nice
I got bragging rights
I be grabbing mikes
I be spitting that fire out of dragon pipes
Who these fag's claiming to have swag and tights
I'm a rock legend
These niggas rock leggings
And think they cute
No need to dispute
When I hear that wack shit I just press mute
