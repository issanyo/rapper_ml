[Verse 1:]
Putting beats in plastic that's like the supermarket for sale
The quality of a good grade A, i don't substitute the product
With monkeys and apes
I hope the gold Rolex stops so it's right in front of your face
These rappers trying to run for triple in the alley
But i will throw you out at third base
Probably though your wife get all greyhound
Now that she with me on 42nd and 8th
Leaked out like toothpaste
Come and get a few male with a fitted rammed in a toupe
I can get you an inside job wearing that dashiki
Videos watching you talk with braids
Putting in braids the mouse is on camera
You may look fake 6 foot 4 now you want
To spin on the floor and break
Engineer smokin cigarette
Let’s see what you made
I’m disgusted the toilet flush
Now I’m a spray lysol on your name up and down
You still wearing the mood ring
I know you anti-too much bling
You'd rather wear second hand jeans
For the dry skin intensive care i spread your face up
With vaseline

[Verse 2:]
So we traverse through the landscape
Handshake precipice
Eyes locked i locked into the soul and then invested in it
The journey is up in astro north
After shooting at the shooting stars
I have to crash a rock
I can feel the aftershock it’s nothing more
Them the material something is behind the other door
I caught it creeping through the crevice
The base guards the base elements
I trace sediments back to the origin
Posttest and godineses  masculine
Extraterestra mutua mortified
Cut the wire border across the blend with the rest
Puffing at my chest building my nest
I am more molestalied mahad dweller
Universal time teller in
It's not all that often
Metamorfosis who's going to leave them and door opened
Kept the long cord put the kettle on pull the potion
Madletic led is on my arms move paper mars
Roll for what it wanted cause the storms over
