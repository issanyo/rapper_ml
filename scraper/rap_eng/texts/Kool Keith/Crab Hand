I got a crab hand
I got a normal hand
I'm 'bout to cut some shit up with my crab hand
I got a crab hand

I'm 'bout to cut some shit up with my crab hand
Grab you with my crab hand (snip snip)
Grab you with my crab hand (snip snip)
Grab- Grab you with my crab hand (snip snip)

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
I grab that nigga with the crab hand
They want you to be like that man
Iâ€™m nick with the take you the swisha[?]
How pusha, militia
They bumpin' talkin' on the toilet tissue
My flow comin' 'round nigga, miss you
My hands are crabby
Cum in my scumbag
George the clock they know to raise their tone up
Groaningp, prostate, girl let me bone ya
Ring around the rosey and you know me
Move down gorrila you lonely
Rodeo by my balls stay dry
Pow, scary, living, giving
Fools wanna play that [?] image
Complex bullshit
Niggas tell stories
Lyrical dorky, suck my cock for

[Verse 2: Kool Keith]
Shoot that three point three-peat repeat
Rappers come and see me, Bossalini, freaky
Share your bitch, I'll barbecue you
Through you, who you
Bite ya, ow boo boo
Back up clown, you dancing clown
Skinny pants, pull your pants up, hold my flow
My balls smell rancid

Yeah
Ya get out of town and get back out on your horses real slow
