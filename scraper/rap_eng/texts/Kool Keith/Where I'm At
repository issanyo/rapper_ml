Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?

[Verse 1]
Chicago, I'm a bull, they call me Boozer
I'm strong inside, Indiana, I'm a woozer with the ball
I'm so black I look like Michael Cooper
Block the dunks, are you stupid?
I'm so funkified ask Chaka Khan and Rufus
Wearing Jamaican clocks
The bald head make me move like slick watch
The Sonics still shoot like downtown Freddie Brown
Knockin' on doors to ask fast, is Eddie around?
Your girl's a fine broad showin' me boobs in the lounge
She likes the way I pass inbounds
Walkin' up into people's houses wearin' king crowns
I beat trials, they dryin' off with pink towels
Cadillac pull up, I sit with the mink for hours
I'm up a hundred points, tonight I'm playing against cowards
Your girl want allowance
Ask Kevin Garnett why people call me Dave Cowens
Sidney Wicks is still a Celt
I got the national championship belt
At center I play nine foot
You get stuck using a sky hook

[Hook]
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?

[Verse 2]
They think they hard with plastic, Spencer Hayward
Those boys ain't good, they wanna be Boyz n the Hood
They rap at halftime, they're toys in the hood
Larry Kenon, come through your block leanin'
Your girl's creamin', alley oop off her face
Let's go withdraw from Chase
Strong arm your team, get back in there like Ant Mase
The best at the mic and I am faced
Over 500, ball first place
An easy free throw is hard to take
Your verses sound like a cliche remake
You sure know how to make the double Ds shake
Qualified for style, I can tell your ballpark frank
By the way you scream over the beat loud
Get down when I put the horror movie out
With me and her and two girlfriends in the house
You not a star 'cause that's what a star's about
Being about, you must be a squid
A lobster walkin' up like a trout
I'm Roger dressed up like a captain
Who cares about you sittin' up broke in a Magnum
Dodger, you need a ghostwriter, all this you hear I'm the author
Boss you around like a father
Make with your moms, she a cheerleader
Swinging the baton
With a little boy named John John
You must be silly, smoking chron (fabulous)

[Hook]
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
Ghetto, where I'm at?
