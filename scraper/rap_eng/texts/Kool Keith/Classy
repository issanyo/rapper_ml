[Intro:]
(Lil bit closer!)
You know how I do dis (closer!)
Lampin out, coolin out

[Verse 1:]
Girl you know I’m big headed, souped up to d T
D Grammy Awards watch me repeat it, George Kooney award
Just me an ma rhymes kiss, like Rihanna and Chris
You know I do dis for breakfast, d waiters gotta have butter on ma grits
Gave the greatest day starter kits, they be got d mom I miss
Livin up in d grand high like lil Rich
The maze know us elders, most rappers tryin to come up from the bottomless pit
When I hear em thay all saying ma shh, the man who love Toni Braxton mother
Charge MCs to see me man you gotta pay a cover
Sittin in d Cadillac 16 wit Magnum rubbers, yo girl prepare supper
Soul food back out, they outta style they old, see they old school

[Chorus:]
Yea, ah-ha, they be classified
All d money I been gettin all d places I’d invented
Yea, we classified
All the females I be touchin, the topics been discussin
Yea we classified
Classified, classified
Yea, they all been a lie
Here lil boy, here’s yo pacifier
Yea, yea but I’m classified, classified

[Verse 2:]
The way I’m feelin, matches no other feelin
Livin d high life, what you thinkin bout gettin
Coppin a lamborghini I’m hopin they never see me, broke
Unless they hear it from me on ma first CD
Girl hey your beauty, beauty is such a blessin
Never thinkin bout leavin, I know it’s outta d question
I’m gone, I told you I’m on
But she comin with me, ridin so swiftly
Don’t wanna press no brakes but we can get shifty
Switch gears, an now we end up at d hotel girl
I’m out d hood so I spend it on ma hotel floor
Come an take you on a ride shorty don’t let go
Don’t let go

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Closer! (closer, closer, closer, closer)[x3]
