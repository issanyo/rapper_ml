[Intro]
ABOVE SEA LEVEL
That remix to get you
{"The next level!"}
This IS, a Agallah, Don Bishop production
{"The next level!"}

[Kool Keith]
Yeah, Tashan, Dorrsett {"The next level!"}
Come correct {"The next level!"}
We got Junkadelic in the house {"The next level!"}
{"The next level!"} New York City {"The next level!"}
Paris, France

I'm writin two millimeters above level
Three centimeters above devil, you know the spot
Meet your face, I deal with the freckle, the right check-o
Any time on the table promoters head to the back
Before they show, I gotta settle
Party down, park the Bacardi down
Stack Atari sound, I'm revved up at 100 point 1
I'm sorry Charlie the crowd, geeked up on bottles of barley
Don't let them get off the Harley {"The next level!"}

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Above sea level, the first treble production remastered
I'm more than you perpetual, I hope y'all on schedule

[Kool Keith]
The second chance'n; you better believe
The lyrics spin like the legs of a breakdancer
First turn like a potential, meteorite burn
You know how we do, with heavy EQ
Mechanical nigga workin hard like R2-D2
Star Wars, III Episode
Move at red code with vitamins for a stuffed up nose
And a head cold
You see 'em swallowin on the bars of a head load
They can't handle my opposite jam selection
No Michael "Jam" perfection
I release atomic fibers at the end of every note
Like the urine stains hittin off your white coat
{*prolonged scratching of "The next level!"*}

[Chorus]
{"The next level!"} {"The next level!"}
{"The next level!"} {"The next level!"}

[Kool Keith]
I deal easy with this
You witness the climax raw on the twister
More higher my gold records hang on my walls like the Pointer Sisters
The biggest elaborate funk, action for your trunk action
It's all the best, speakin the best, speakin from New York to Paris
Junkadelic, eatin at the restaurant
With Red Ron, we're eatin salads
{*prolonged scratching of "The next level!"*}

[Chorus]
