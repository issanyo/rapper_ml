Yeah, kick a little freestyle, show you kids how I get wild
You know, show ya how to make records, do it the right way
You listeners out there, you know it's real, you know, it's real
Yeah check it out, you know one time

I make statements, permanent holes in what you say
It ain't that riff raff junk and all the garbage that you play
College kids know that's a Frisbee, it's a no, no
I got thank god it's not released in a promo

Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up

I kick one style, you Kurt, yo drop that record right down
They wanna dance, yo stupid buggin', c'mon right now
Yeah, I guess I'll jump up on the record
Your A&R man is quite stupid, he can't check it

My style go again, my style flow again
My style kicks like Jim Kelly in a show again
Alright you buggin' my brother, you still thinkin'
A M.C. Battle, no comp, a rapper still stinkin'

You got that deal this time 'cause you was lucky man
Yo, gimme my tape back yo, what fuck it man
I continue I walk with my heat I burn your style
Like a live barbecue smells good I turn your style
You don't want none, it's rabbit time and duck season

Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up

I put my mask on, the thing with me you can't see me
My freestyle get wild makin' rappers wanna leave me
Yo pack yo bags yo kid you catchin' Amtrak
I'm revolvin' like a pin worm in yo ass crack

I don't care who you bad, I work your rectum out
Give you a shower cap, a rag wipe your spectrum out
I see you boogie' an' down hop on the first floor
I see you boogie' an' up hop on the second floor

You ain't that good kid, I'm bringin' back more
Your crew is over like Breakout and the Funky Four
Super Rhymes the Fifth Dimension on they last tour
Yo, better step back, yo tell 'em that I'm comin' through

Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up

I come like Fright Night, you come and you fear the funky monster
You walk like herman, I cut your hair like Eddie Munster
Don't try that grampa style, you catch a tissue wipe
You talkin' big shit, ya rhymin' on a tiny mic

I freak the funk, I flow 'n funk, I freak it fast, I freak it past
Like Scottish wipe ash
You don't know you margarine, come on butter man

I hate to say it straight to your face again
Kickin' that wack junk, you're bound to feel the bass again
I don't, I don't, I don't, yo play kid
If you must test skills you dummies can stay, kid

Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up

Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
Move on the floor, spread 'em wide, eat 'em up
