[Kool Keith]
Project Polaroid
Everything full blast, android
Exaggerated b-boy

I pull the ar-chive
The dogs bark live
Tom put the car on Park Drive
Pictures await, the art arrive
Red carpet
Walkin to the limo, got the glare in my eyes
With pine tar
Cousin of Simpson, ask Bart
Tonight we got a whole posse
Goin to Wal-Mart
On the Bay Area BART
Lookin for the barbecue
Hot links in the shopping cart
Restin at the park

Project P-O-L-A-roid
Something you wanna back up, and a-void

{*instrumental and scratching to end*}
