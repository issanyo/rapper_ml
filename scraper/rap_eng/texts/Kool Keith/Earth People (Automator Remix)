[Verse 1: Dr. Octagon]
First patient, pull out the skull, remove the cancer
Breaking his back, chisel necks for the answer
Supersonic bionic robot voodoo power
Equator ex my chance to flex skills on Ampex
With power meters and heaters gauge anti-freeze
Octagon oxygen, aluminum intoxicants
More ways to blow blood cells in your face
React with four bombs and six fire missiles
Armed with seven rounds of space doo-doo pistols
You may not believe, living on the Earth planet
My skin is green and silver, forehead looking mean
Astronauts get played, tough like the ukelele
As I move in rockets, overriding, levels
Nothing's aware, same data, same system

[Verse 2: Dr. Octagon]
Now my helmet's on, you can't tell me I'm not in space
With the National Guard United States Enterprise
Diplomat of swing with aliens at my feet
Coming down the rampart through beam on the street
Obsolete computes, compounds and dead sounds
As I locate intricately independent
Economic vomit, I save re-store food
In Capsule D my program is ability
For a reaction and response to a no-one
Identification Code: Unidentified
I got cosmophonic, pressed a button, changed my face
You recognized, so what? I turned invisible
Made myself clear, reappear to you visual
Disappear again, zapped like an android
Face the fact, I fly on planets every day
My nucleus friend, prepare, I return again
My 7XL is not yet invented

[Verse 3: Dr. Octagon]
Space Ranger, contact tubes, send them FedEx
I program one and go to Earth through the fax machine
My number's Seven-Oh-Nine Seven-Five-Five Six-E-L-Three
Computer File: Nine-Three
Digital level, standing on the terminal
Upside down through polygons fighting pentagons
Changing blue skin, my brown color's coming back
I'm psychedelic this time, come in rainbow
Look at the green lights and y'all see my brain glow
Five colours: yellow, black, and red and green, purple

[Hook]
Earth People, New York and California (New York City)
Earth People, I was born on Jupiter (Danger Unknown)

[Outro]
I will create more and delete
The computer chips for the fossils that we reach
Keep progressing in the far world
The forces of evil
There was nothing, not even cars ask Knievel
Space is my planet
I live there
Eat there
Wash there
Bathe there
That's my home
