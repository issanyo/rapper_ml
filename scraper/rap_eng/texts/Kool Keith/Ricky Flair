[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
They call me liquified
I'm liquid side, I'm outside, I'm sick with side
Her ass up, she thickuified
I got the Rolls Royce shined up, it's bicuified
Banana peel, don't slip and slide
Karate speakers, watch me kick inside
Make up my mind, girlie, she said she want this dick inside
Cherry apple, they out picking pies
Like a buzzard picking eyes
I got rules, everything is strickenize
Y'all come inside, god damnit, I'm cooking with the kitchen knives
I got that butter on that turkey
Shooting it in the oven like James Worthy
I made the food, now you want to curse me
I'm going back to New Jersey
What time do the Amtrak come back to New Jersey

[Verse 2: Big Sche Eastwood]
Big Sche, I don't smoke cigars, I smoke Vegas
So give me the whole bottle of champagne
I wear my shades at night, I'm a true player
The throne is taken, nigga, it's my reign
The bitches butter me up like outer space
Got a pimp blushing, even though I know she fake
Make me feel good, just remember your place
I'm the seven to God and you're in sixth place
And I wouldn't be God if devil's didn't hate
I'm a mack, all day, every day
I'm 'bout cake, gimme-gimme me-gimme me some
While you watching me, I been getting plenty, son
This some Kool Keith and Big Sche shit (uh)
This some magnetic force field shit (uh)
This some Ricky, Ricky-Ricky Flair shit (whew!)
Nature Boy affiliates, we gon' handle biz
