Yes, I must come, put the toys away
Check it out one time, let me get biz
What's this? Who this?
It's me the man yeah, deliverin' every plan
Check it out one time, bust a rhyme

I be the phantom known as the brother to racer X
When girls fantasize my horror, they want sex
Abilities, a new tissue thank you please
My bang, bang, bang with hammers on my grill cheese

You see me nude in fact I'm takin' Theragram
Eatin' my pet cat and old Virginia ham
Yo lady, I'm ready for beans and rice
Yo thank you mam

Yo Sam yo check them panties, yo black smell 'em
If they funky what you want me to tell 'em?
I seen her walking down town in my complexion
Cute thing, pitty pattin' my erection

She had to put out the cat and pour the milk out
Lick, lick, lick, I'm comin' naked with my silk out
Don't try to pay me no mind yo healthy country girl

We can play games, how bout me jerkin' off in wayne's world?
I see you ready like Eddie, I take you butt to beddy
Now put these freak boots on with you black teddy
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on fat wax

I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax

Look out I'm comin' with my Mexican sombrero
Buritto, borado, my green El Dorado
I'm runnin' valley streams into Denver Colorado
You play out you toy pimps you bums better stay out

I got styles and fingers on the panty line
You wear cologne your White Diamond smell fine
You hip and hop up, don't make the steel pop up
If you was biscuits with gravy you get sloped up

Yo wake up, yo pay me your semen's getting wetter
I write 'em at home and send a funky sexy letter
You gotta go home your baby stay is real early
I'm not Larry, Moe or Three Stooge, I ain't Curly

I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax

Yo get up yo girl, no time to get no sleep
Answer your pager it's naked man on your beep
I'm comin' cummin' baby runnin' runnin' won't you pump it?
You thump it you bigga 'ol butt you thump bass

My exciting moments releasing stuff on your face
I'm cummin' bam, bam and ridin' like a rowdy cowdy
You on a horseback and girls step up sayin' howdy

I go for miles and miles, I pack piles and piles
You know it's cold out, I come to turn the heat on
Yo girls step back, change panties turn the beat on

I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax

I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax
I'm comin' home droppin' seeds on the fat wax

That's right, comin' home, check it out one time with this rhyme
Lyrically I flow but not like you know, white like snow
Kid when I come around blow but my name ain't
Joe making pizza dough
