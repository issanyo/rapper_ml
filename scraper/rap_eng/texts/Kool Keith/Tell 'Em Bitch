[Kool Keith]
Kool Keith back up in this motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin, you know what I'm sayin
I'd like to tell all these motherfuckers
I'd like to tell all you motherfuckers, about theyself
About theyself, about what they think they are
About what they think they are
Motherfuckers ain't shit, you ain't shit

Fuck gold and platinum and jewelry
Diamonds glistenin red, I'm still the overgrown boy freak man
Fall asleep, still piss in the bed
Ask your girl nigga, I piss on your head
If you're neo and unfunky, I'm guaranteed usually
Ten grand or more a show
But for five or six I'm ready to piss in your dreads
Who's ready to handle the confunction, jazz
And everybody with they first new trendy equipment
Could press the KEYS, and kiss my ASS
No prestigious toilets and golden bathroom trimmings
Dress your bitch up like Batwoman, and shit on her mask
Dimepieces run with the boring niggas
My sex life, I piss on top of your cash
Your money talk, I wipe my ass up with your Cottonelle nigga
Rappin against me, you ain't shit
My job is to make your doofy-ass baseball caps fit
Pimple-faced bastard, watch who you rap with
And cover your motherfuckin buttcheeks with Chapstick
I'm a grown-ass man, you can suck mine
And that talk behind my back circle shit
Superstar gassed up niggas smokin that glass dick
My first name is microphone, I call you last to spit
Bra and panties under your button up
Don't come around wit'cha ass hangin out, teasin me with fake tits
I'm the celebrity destroyer, I defecate on your shoulderblades
I jerk off on anybody that think they good
Grab the subway train, and drop turds on your bitch
Hit Philadelphia, grab a cheesesteak and hang out with Mitch
About two million dollars got fucked up
Hotel suites, Pave rings and girls and shit
Indoor rappin mansion-ass nigga
Come outside from that old hideaway bodyguards, watch you shit
I don't care, I enjoy myself you scared son of a bitch
Fuck the buckets and V.I.P. rooms
Posin with one Moet bottle, and a big-ass clique
Plast fast motherfuckers standin on wooden legs
Amateur niggas go down on cheap tape
What you think that bullshit gon' stick?
Kool Keith, signin off this MOTHERFUCKER
Let you motherfuckers KNOW
I tell you straight, I'll come to your motherfuckin SHOW
