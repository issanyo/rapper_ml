[Chorus:]
Finger Pop [repeat x20]

[Verse 1:]
I gotta get her round
Make a bitch pump
Jump up, jump down
Move with the count
Hands play the bongos
Hands cause she said so
Flick her on her ass
So jumpy, so [?]
Presto, chango
Leaning in the range rov’
Rain bring the rainbow
Sippin’ on the tango
Foreign lango
Let’s go swag tho
I’m black pro
Black pro
Axe-o [x3]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
The best at it
Strip clubs
Beach houses
Big thighs and dramatic
The blessings come when she spreads that cho-cha on the mattrass
I’m all over that ass
Kissing you all over as we talk in first class
I’m open off her features
Smooth skin
Astronomical view
She stuck in the two-seater
Nipples are pretty
Penthouse suite in the marriott
Overlooking the city
Steamy sex in the sauna
Hot in mini dress with lace
Heels thrown in the corner
I move with a smooth influence
Sex in public places
Everybody watching
I stroke harder just to show my rudeness
That’s the real talk
Bust off in front of everybody
Let the nut drip of the sidewalk
You would talk to angel
The cock running half mast
The tits were strangled
Johnson & johnson baby oil on the anal
We can make it sweat
Ask the family members
Ask and incest

[Chorus:]
