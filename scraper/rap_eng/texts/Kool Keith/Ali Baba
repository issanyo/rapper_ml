[Verse 1]
Prince of divine, y'all call me royal highness
Ride through your town, blinging off my solid [?]
Woman with veils pouring out my ginger ale
I don't do drugs, never did fishscale
Lamborghini, I see it shipping out of Israel
Camels walk through the dust, I don't feel the wind
Money is nothing, a [?] I spend
Buy the wig, which one you want, the China wig
Mascara and MAC, your butt is getting kind of big
I go in your house, you drop your bra where you live
You show me your life, your bald-headed little kids
Text the ahk', leave your panties in the Maybach
Get with your green and blonde hair, I'm coming with the gray fox
Six thousand, six hundred for the counter
Imagine the cold

[Hook]
Imagine the cold x6

[Verse 2]
Ali wiggle to the top, Ali wiggle to the bottom
She wearing them panties, baby, you don't got to
Let me hold them, finger inside lotto
A smooth model, aces in the green bottle
We slam the car door, you like the taste of avocado
They call me Paris, London, New York
I like to ease inside when you move your shorts
You got my name on your breast, ask Kanye
I must twinkle the west
Another man came up the street
And he said to me
Ali Baba
Ali Baba

[Outro]
Ali Baba x4
Ali x12
Ali Baba
Hello, this is Ali Baba
Ali Baba, Ali Baba
