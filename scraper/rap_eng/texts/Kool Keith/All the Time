[Kool Keith]
Yeah!  Straight from New York City
It's all the way live - youknowhatI'msayin?
And I gotta tell you like this
Like Shan said, I pioneered this
And I'ma let you have it

Super status, structure, lyrically the baddest
No time to perpetrate on front street, I rock the fattest
Ultimate ego, your rap style, sounds feeble
Bionic black man, crowd packed with tons of people
No one the equal, should grab the mic, stop my sequel
Purchase your ticket, I been here since Wilson Pickett
Shut off your rap dream, career's over, that's on high beam
You on the trampoline learnin, you still concernin
I burn your index, spray your raps like they insects
I want that action

Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 2X)

I do this all the time
(Every night and every day, we make moves so don't you hate)
I do this all the time
(Every night and every day, Kool Keith does his thing his way)

[Kool Keith]
Movin steady through yo' zip code, arrangements, your lip fold
Y'all Billboard hype companies line that y'all ship go
Got your mom believin the label clown pick your room up
Y'all stuck in contracts in pop's house, clean your room up
I pull your charter from the blind side, to the start up
There'll be no star, pull them stickers off your rented car
Your man is playin also, a fake mafioso
His rap is so-so, I'm warmed up like chocolate cocoa
Who you know go?  Get that kid, off your promo
I move like Marko, New York City think I'm Cuomo
You sayin, "Oh no, Keith is droppin big solo"
I hang on Grand Street, with shoppin bags down on SoHo

Chorus

[Kool Keith]
Catch you out there, with mic stands, cords in yo' hand
Youse a first year rookie, duplicatin Method Man
I test yo' skills, fanbase that only go to Peteskil
Servin headwork, new MC's, watch your neck jerk
I'm such an expert, I pull you quick, stop your concert
I drop my interludes sharp now, words and inserts
Back your face up, while sound man, turn the bass up
You wearin makeup, your skirt is short, sippin a quart
You think you're hardcore?  You're opposite, rappin softcore
Kickin metaphor with zeroes, I give you a score
Monster amateur, I move up kid, then I damage ya
Check one two

Chorus

(Every night and every day, we make moves so don't you hate)
(Every night and every day, Kool Keith does his thing his way)
(Every night and every day, we make moves so don't you hate)
(Every night and every day, Kool Keith does his thing his way)
(Every night and every day, we make moves so don't you hate)
(Every night and every day, Kool Keith does his thing his way)
