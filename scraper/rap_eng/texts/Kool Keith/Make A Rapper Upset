[Hook: Kool Keith]
Make a rapper upset, make a DJ upset x4

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
They say I'm rap mogul Russell Simmons in the Hip-Hop Summit
Too many girls got me coming
I'm what your wife is loving
Broadway ventriloquist
Every rapper out sit on my lap like a puppet
He's my miniature-sized Flip Wilson, watch him talk
"What you mean you working me like a puppet?
Okay, then who are you?"
Whoa, shut up, I'm the owner of you
I can make you move your shoulders too
Frosted cookies, I don't do
Because you rap from the butt on down with the Hostess crew
Cupcakes by the tons, your girl has some nice Cinnabuns
You rap in the booth and brag, I like the way her juices run

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Shade Clock Da Rappa]
They say my songs ain't radio-friendly, so they don't play me
I'm on that Gucci, Fendi, bitches steadily envy
I'm all about my loot, niggas calling me pretty
I'm on that Puss In Boots,  niggas calling me kitty-kitty
My fat cat got niggas committing murder
Drowning in this pussy is a death you never heard of
I keep it low-key but you can find me in [?]
I rub off, motherfucking jerk-off
I make a rapper upset, piss a DJ off
Niggas mad but fuck that, turn your feelings off
Turn the lights on and see a fucking icon
Not that shit on your iPhone but the shit that Michael Jacks-on
Shade Clock, Kool Keith got me on this motherfucking track but no pimping
I look like an R & B singer, right, but no singing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fred Beanz]
Fred Beans, I keep it locked, God know I keep it true
Why fake what it is, watch your place, what it do
Rappers, they be mad at me, DJ's, they after me
But I'm in the hood on my grind causing catastrophes
I would prefer to keep it low as possible while trying to blow
I'm out here stashing all my money watching all my statures grow
Keep your bitch away from me, especially if you're cuffing her
'Cause one minute, she's in your arms, the next minute, I'm fucking her
You can catch me on a late night trying to get my head right
Or with my team in the studio getting my flows tight
My comfort level is never short of a thousand
That's why I only feel safe when a thousand niggas surround me
So think what you want to think when it comes to a G
You know a lot of gangsters but not like me
So grab yourself a cup, fill it halfway up
'Cause this here is a toast for niggas who don't give a fuck

[Hook]
