[Hook: Kool Keith]
The extra thought that count
Coming from Rocky Mount
Spaulding basketballs come out the sky
Which they bounce

The extra thought that count
That come from Rocky Mount
Spaulding basketballs come out the sky
Which they bounce

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Spirit of the golden Palestinian Indian
The formula's cold, you simian
I came from Peru on a choo-choo
To train to bring the goo coo-coo
Sit down and make it do what it do
To me, too many too many too many too many
Businessmen trying to be GQ
That's not the case
I spit on the main floor
They rap on B2
I'm all around
Translated the vocab
Coming male and Hebrew

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kool Keith]
Anything is possible
Maybe a couple of mil from the Paris government
Might make this a new world event
When other groups come and leave like Tastycakes
The flavor will still be there
Rhyme "soda" with "China"
Spitting phrases
You know I got two pair

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The I.M.O.]
Spaulding basketballs make no sound in the forest
I'm solo, around no crowd
No support
Where they claim they really heard my sound?
Illuminati cause I know them
Started off as one chosen deity's affection
I throw them 'bows to stomp em
I load them clips and pop one
The Yahtzi pee-pee
Dick in the bitches' butts
Still in the crates, but the bitches bring more bucks
I'm a pimp; bitch, where my cut?
Cuevo and champagne spilling out my cup
Walk with a strut; will ball, don't give a fuck
Handle the ball with a Iverson's touch
George that smush, still put em in a push
Spin the ball and ring the clutch

[Hook]
