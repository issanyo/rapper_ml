[Intro: Ronnie T]
Party peoples, in the place to be
Just for you; it's the Ultramagnetic MC's!

[Verse 1: Kool Keith + Ced-Gee + together]
Say what, Peter Piper?
To hell with childish rhymes!
'Cause this jam is just movin'
The crowd is steady-groovin'
To a supersonic pace
With highs and stupid bass!
With some pep
And the step
'Cause the beat is so funky the pace is well kept—'cause we're—

[Chorus]
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Kool Keith!

[Verse 2: Kool Keith]
They use the simple back and forth, the same, old rhythm
That a baby can pick up, and join, right with them
But their rhymes are pathetic, they think they copacetic
Using nursery terms, at least not poetic
On a educated base, intelligent wise
As the record just turn, you learn, plus burn
By the flame of the lyrics which cooks the human brain
Providing overheating knowledge, by means causing pain
Like a migraine headache, your cells start to melt
While the Technics spin, the wax is on the felt
Motivating clockwise the more you realize
Moe Love's moving steady, by most, with Everready
Like a battery, charged, I'm worth the alkaline
Yes the mystery to solve, so seek and define
These words I've given, extremely knowledge driven
With a Datsun, a Maxima to glide
Yes, the wizard Kool Keith, and I'm sportin' my ride
'Cause we're—

[Chorus]
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Ced Gee!

[Verse 3: Ced Gee]
Usin' frequencies and data, I am approximate
Leaving revolutions turning, emerging chemistry
With the precise implications, achieved, adversely
Explorating demonstrating, ruling, dominating
Igniting causing friction with nuclear alarms
Separates competing biters from me, the scientist
As I execute, lyricist, known as predators
When by strippin' high potents and makin' penicillin
I will surely sort out, and stomp, every pest
Oh the rampaging paramedic, potent is my title
To inform other worlds of such, a holocaust
Quick serve as a purpose, preparing first aid
With medical utensils, the wizard, Ced-Gee
Is advanced with elevation, astonishing with rhythm
'Cause we're—

[Chorus]
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Ultra (Magnetic, Magnetic) MCs
Moe Love!

[Verse 4:]
