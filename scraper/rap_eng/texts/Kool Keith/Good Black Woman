[Verse 1]
I'm a brother from the planet
Come down to Earth
And she's my queen
Queen home cooking beans
She makes the food I like
She cooks with stainless steel
And all the pots she burns
She's bringing me llama
Mashed potatoes
And serving me like a waiter
She's a good black woman
Or she could be a white girl
Maybe even Chinese
She works hard at night
Scrubbing my knees
Me and her, in the shower
Making all kinds of love
While my African brother plays the bongos
I talk about the game
Me and her, playing chess at night
Sitting on the love seat
I reach for the cloud
I put my hat on
I look like McCloud
And then I turned on the TV
We got so easy
We started to watch The Purple Dragon
She made some good popcorn
We started watching Barney
He came out with Bebop
And this is life, we got down
Cause she's my baby, my love
We went on vacation
We went camping last night
Down to the Poconos
I bought that cereal with the commercial
Toucan Sam
Follow your nose
Get down under the covers
I did it my way
She can be anybody she wants
She wore a dashiki
We went to Africa
I bought her some big earrings
She got a bone in her nose, baby
I took her up to Silvia's, 125th street
