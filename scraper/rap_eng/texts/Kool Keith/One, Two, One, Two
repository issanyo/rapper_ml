[Kool Keith]

One two one two, one two one two
One two one two, one two one two!
One two one two, one two one two!

I just step and I rap rap
Move and you clap clap
Dance and wiggle, and little feets go tap tap
Over and switch switch, change my pitch pitch
You can get down down, rock with my sound sound
As I rock freak a rhyme, blow up the town town
MC's in the back, Double Trouble can learn learn
As I start to burn burn, MC's wait your turn turn
Look at me black black, don't come to me wack wack
I chew em like gum, eat your crew like a Snack Pack
Walk and I flex flex, check and I stop stop
Beat em on down down, suckers I rock rock
Cling on, swing on, walk and you step step
Pick up your pep pep, build up my rep rep
Move and get smacked smacked, I'm tellin you black black
I told you again, I'm clockin fat knots

("I'm the freaker, the one who freaks the funk" -- Cypress Hill)
One two one two, one two one two
One two one two, one two one two
("I'm the freaker, the one who freaks the funk")
One two one two, one two one two

Continue I flow flow, not stiff and I blow blow
X'll get raw raw, and travel on tour tour
MC's they get crushed crushed, stomped in the dust dust
Mack-10 Tec, every rhyme goes bust bust
Out on the West West, facing your chest chest
Let me go rock rock, people just clock clock
Girls they wet, damp panties and jock jock
Move and I swing swing, to Riker's and Sing-Sing
Knock on your brain, picture bell go ding ding
MC's that flow flow, I think they all so-so
Like G.I., G.I., kiddie toy named Joe Joe
Rappers are doodoo doodoo, deep as a voodoo voodoo
Come and don't play play, watch what I say say
Pick up your mic, I'm clockin fat knots

("I'm the freaker, the one who freaks the funk")
One two one two, one two one two
One two one two, one two one two

X'll get wreck wreck, breakin your neck neck
Your brain is the seed, like a bird I go peck peck
Don't call me no Jeff-Jeff, Keith no Sweat Sweat
You can be dog dog, cat and my pet pet
As I go woo woo, yo B I'm so smooth smooth
Rhymin like Wild Bill, strong and I feel feel
Suckers ain't jack jack, jumpin on Zapp Zapp
Thinkin they funk funk, soft and they punk punk
Like they in jail jail, soft and they swing soft
But I gotta dip dip, you stay off my tip tip
(Why?)  Inside Hermin's Head, I'm clockin fat knots

("I'm the freaker, the one who freaks the funk")
One two one two
One two one two, one two one two
("I'm the freaker, the one who freaks the funk")
One two one two, one two one two
One two one two, one two one two
("I'm the freaker, the one who freaks the funk")
One two one two, one two one two
One two one two, one two one two
("I'm the freaker, the one who freaks the funk")
("I'm the freaker, the one who freaks the funk")
