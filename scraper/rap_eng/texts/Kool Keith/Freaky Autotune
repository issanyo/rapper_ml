[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
One, I'm up like I'm on caffeine
Drunk Josephine
Real me, I lock and lean
Can see me coming in the Rolls Royce
It's so gleam
I got that American all-star team
They call me Dizzy D
Export, import
Your girl with the fat stomach
She wants to get aboard
I'm playing the NBA with shorts
Drinking that O.E
2 quarts
Uh, they call me Holly
Lamping in the Cadillac, I'm Polly
Your bitch call me when she see the entree
Tables for 4, or 5, or 6 people
We're coming in the club
These niggas think we're see-through
They don't know my back-up people
Somebody tell that motherfucker thanks
In the club, your bitch has her hands on my chicken wings
A fish filet, a bottle of Don
They call me the fucking Fonz
Leather coat down with my long johns

[Hook: Kool Keith]
It's so windy
Yeah, we're so gravy
On the side, I saw your baby
I'm gon' fuck your lady
Ooh, it's so windy
Hi, baby
We're so win-
We're so gravy
Hi, baby

[Verse 2: KidMiddi]
I dare a motherfucker to get out of hand
How would you like if I smacked your baby mama booty cheeks with a hundred grand
I'm the type of guy that dudes won't tell me shit
Like, I'm the type of nigga that will make a bitch poke all over my dick
And I don't give a fuck, that's why I keep higher clouds clou...
If I b-b-bust these nuts on her, that bitch, she's gon drown
And I don't give a fuck
I'm in a stress mode, I'm in a stress mode
Bitch, get on your knees and lick my damn toes
Yeah, I'm the Emperor
Oh, shit
Oh, shit, don't let this nigga in
Who let this, who let, oh, my god
It's class clown again
Man, the world is coming to an end
How the fuck, uh how the fuck are we gonna shut his ass up
Oh, shit
They want me to surrender
But, yeah, '88 baby, '03, that's December
And yeah that's the day he born
Yeah, I'm so strong
And now that's how a motherfucker believe in King Kong
Hey, keep that slop [?]

[Hook: Kool Keith]
Oh, we're so gravy
On the side, I saw your baby
I'm gon' fuck your lady
Ooh, we're so gravy
Baby
We're so win-
We're so gravy
Hi, baby


I'm gon' fuck your lady
Ooh, we're so gravy
Baby
Hi, baby
