[Hook: Kool Keith]
Non stop, non stop, non stop, non stop x3

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
I used to rock with Red Alert coming down the block
Looking at my rocks, wearing minks outside
Looking out the binoc's with some customer Ver socks
With my JVC box, catch you spill out, then spill out
Rolling around with chill out, girls sleeping on pillows
Looking out tinted windows, people flossing in rentals
I chew 'em like Mentos, burning up instrumentals
Boosting credentials, stopping rappers potentials
Crashing parties with cymbals, freaking broads with pimples
Taking pictures of breasts, going to dinner with bimbos
Turning rappers to embryo's
Subway sandwiches, who want to play heroes
Head and shoulders, knees, and toes
Take a dump on your Afros, model and pose
Suckers floss their clothes
They must be high on a little bit of blow (That's cut)
T-wet, respect, T-wreck neglect
Them boys are insects

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rah Digga]
Non stop, non stop
Non stop from hopscotch and Pop Rocks
Foul coming out of my mouth like I'm a shock jock
Got it locked, stocked, neighborhood block watch
Swishing on you boys, all net, watch the shot clock
Do the Foxtrot all on your snot box
Drop a load on 'em like plop-plop
See, I could go on for eternity, non stop, the journey be
Self-proclaimed GOAT, I know, I know, the nerve of me
The constant aggression ever since adolescence
If I didn't know better, I'd think my ass was molested
Take it out on these records, you should see their expressions
Hey, conscious music lovers, yeah, I do have a message
No, it's not introspective, but a valuable lesson
Fuck around and get smoked, nothing left but some resin
Fuck around and get choked, might left some impressions
Be very afraid when Digga-Digga in your sessions, boys

[Hook]
