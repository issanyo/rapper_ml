Power

[Chorus]
Power of the world
Power of the world (Power)
Aliens with S curls...

Detonated format, the aristocrat
The United States and Europe can all interact
I'm seeing colours white and pearl tracks
We can all watch on IMAX, watch the music industry have a climax
I remember girls used to play scrotum like a hi-hat
Freaking the wheelchair, where's ya thigh at
Me and Automator tour, walking through Iraq
Pterodactyl, dinosaur medicated from awe from penzor
I been where roaches been crawl
Watch insects have sex while vocals come from the larynx
Girls reeds look good when they play my clarinet
Everybody dumbed down on social network
The download stealing my medical concepts
Dr. octagon holding Lady Gaga's baby in a private jet
On all fours, I see Katy Perry at her best
The Wolfman calling 300 pounds up to his chest
The howling of the Siberian husky, don't make me go back inside and  cook chicken curry
Doctor Oc' look out the window I see snow flurries

[Chorus]

Nevertheless, i come save veteran housewives
I get inside, make the jump shot while the stuntman scuba dives
Go sit in Starbucks come get these burgers and fries
Y'all haunted by the dog, you can't see my burgundy eyes
Riding over the top of the city with a helicopter with cherry tabletop pies
The government wanna buy my mind
Obama and Michelle watch the spacecraft park by the Whitehouse parallel
Rappers sit in the room like the (?)
JVC and Sony called and asked me what Panasonic sell
The Drelltones industrial
Throwing parakeets out the window with dollar bills
The complaints skyrocket the maniac dr. in Hollywood hills
Offer respect to the copycat rapper with his legs in (?) wrap
A brain surgeon without license doing mal pract'
Hitting harder and harder with vial tracks
The alligators in groove release stew and plack
Boa constrictors in the tank with the light blue rats

[Chorus]

Autopsy in the lobby
The vampire party, girls like when I spray my body with Bacari
Public hair cleaning the carwash the majority
Other groups sending me I'm going to see Ari
Kindergarten i was known for making vaginas outta potty
I was cloned by others mocking me
Suddenly i grown 10 ft tall with Lurch Addams family drawers
The wars the spots with bear claws
People say sasquatch hasn't got nothing on me, i am Neanderthal
Dunking a lime green nerf basketball

[Chorus]


S curls back!!
