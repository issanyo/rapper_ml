[Verse 1:]
It’s the snick
The snookie
I got a record for you to get on (echoes)
I’m out here in London
Call on me
Gonna make it happen and come out great
Fascinating
Call on me
Call on me, talk to me boy up there
It’s that raucous shit
No matter if your top ten on the charts
Up top so fly
Make you wanna dick up
Put it up there
I’m fly up there
I cry up there
Tears, tears
Drop drop
Make you call the shots, shots
With the cops go bap, bap
Finger tippin’
I’m your pimpin’
Stop that pinchin’
Touching, squeezing
Bobbin, weaving
Tour out in Sweden
Lay on my lap
It’s time for a beatin’
Speedin’
Reddy Racer
Etsy racer sexy
Drive that Lexxi
Niggas on the excy
Poppin, hoppin, sloppin
That’s that poppy droppin’
Choose your partner
Dance the square dance
Rosie girlies
Cozy jewelers
Sit you on those [?]
Reppin to the [?]
Whisk you to the SIPS awards
Bumps, bumps
I got bumps
Dance around the pole
Move with your pumps
Ooh la la la la
You make me sound like Debarge
Unzip my zipper
Call me ‘Sarge

[Chorus:]
Supercharged (Supercharged)
[Singing] Super
Supercharged (Supercharged)
[Singing] Super
Supercharged (Supercharged)
[Singing] Super
Supercharged (Supercharged)
[Singing] Super
[Repeat x3]

[Verse 2:] [Black Silver]
Let me hit em with a little bit of this
Bliss, gibberish
Still sit back and it makes em want this
Make em pop it when I lock it down
Make em supercharging ma sound
Hit em with the fast lane
In this summer
Imma kill em with the same game
You couldn’t get with the top notch player
And you deem me the stunning cunnilingus
Owww
When you hold my nuts i’m like wow
Should I go ‘head and buss a nut now
I’m a lotion fan
And you know I’m a Trojan fan
All the girls, the girls they love me
Cause I can throw that D’
Out the cut and model a hit
Back that up and wobble a bit
Black Silv, Kool Keith
Real spit, two chiefs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:] [Shade Clock Da Rappa]
He could go for hours
Cause he’s super super charged
And he’s super super large
We drive super super far
In his super super car
The nigga so super that he move keys
Don’t serve for free
I fuck for a fee
No cause or charity
Shade Clock hun
Fuck me right and I might cum
I might go
I might stay
I might leave
Shade Clock
Who key
Who else
But we
I’m wet, he dry
I’m jet, he fly
He’s high, I’m low
Yes ho I still your man bitch, what tho
I’m caviar
You chick n egg
Half a ya’ll, ya’ll chickenheads
I don’t do poultry
I do poetry
My dude taught me
Pussy drippin, drippin
Like Niagra Falls
He on that Viagra hard
He on that Viagra hard
Nigga I’ll ride you
I ain’t afraid of heights
Washington
Benjamin
Frank an’ that bank is open all night
That bank is open all night [x5]

[Chorus]
