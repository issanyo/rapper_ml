Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville

[Verse 1 - Kool Keith]
Light's blinking in the Lincoln
The continental cop a penny like Abraham Lincoln
Rug on the floor beige mink pretty decent
My cufflinks match the steering wheel even
Park behind the oracle with Norah Jones
Pass some footballs off to ladies in the zone
Tour stadium to stadium can't remember when I been home
CDs came back, so did 8-track
Give me a few off the spindle
Rookie music sound low and technical
Ten Cadillacs pull up in the festival
Women I send a jet to you
Fly my own planes like Wilson Pickett
I went to pilot school
I got flight attendants cooking salmon cakes in high heel shoes
7 ft. 5 I brought the world alive
U.S.A. and Great Britain isles

[Hook - Kool Keith]
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville

[Verse 2 - Mac Mall]
Rolling in a [?]
And backseat I got the blondie and Latin mami, Cleopatra Jones
She riding shotty
Keep [?] wasabi 'cause these suckers wanna try me
Think they hyphy I put whole clip in their white tee
So southern [?] I got macking in my psyche
Concentrating on the bankrolls [?]
[?], the world is cold, but my game is colder
Chinchilla hang off my shoulder
My pinky ring  is ebola
[?] copping blow, I knock your hoe
I got the dough, I serve you the news
Now she marching in some brand new shoes
You know the rules, fools lag and they lose
My and O.G. Kool Keith we trues we pay dues
Now [?] pay us when they choose, never snooze
'Cause we awake your game up
And all around the world and it still won't change us
Rich and famous to riding out to Vegas
In a motherfucking Bonneville

[Hook - Kool Keith]
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
Rolling in the Bonneville
