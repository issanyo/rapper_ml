Word up

[Ced Gee]
Go for yours, aight do it man, right now

[Kool Keith]
Aight..
Yo I'm on, with the freaky style
When you wait debate and rate my
Rhythm expansion, dimension lyric extension
Rise above, amazing days
Crashin your brain, changin ways, sore for days
Figurin out
Midichannels, triggerin out forth
I'm sendin, brains are bendin
Like metal, crust to rust corrode
And low stacks, pick up the wax while you ask
How you do it, show me through it
I never knew it, could be done, no way my son
Cause I'm the one, smackin em up, stackin em up
Boxin you ducks
Packin em up, cause I burn

[Ced Gee]
Aiyyo Keith man, that was kinda of dope man
But you know what man?
I want you to increase your metaphor, you know uh
Make it better for, somethin like that man, aight?

[Kool Keith]
Yeah I know what you mean, like this right?

[Ced Gee]
Yeah man

[Kool Keith]
Aight watch..
Droppin the word to make you think
You're buggin and illin out on, vocab
Connect the -abulary, then switch it
Changin range easily, steadily
Slow it down, ride the beat, throw em down
And sweepin em down
MC's, all dirt on the floor
Stand back in fact you're wack to prove to me
That you're ready to be and willin to see, rhymes flow
Match and go, deep in your brain so
Step back, and wait before you try
To twist in, another line
Designed to catch ya
You gotta watch 2000 I bet ya, perpetrate
Procrastinate, your rhymes are fake, and yo
And let's take your style, use it with mine
Mix it with mine, bring it with mine
And perfect it, and let the public elect it
Buyin selected, ducks are corrected
One at a time, each a stack
Puttin em back, sittin em back, in line
To California, I'm breakin on ya
I'm like a psycho, I'm buggin on ya
Once a day, I'm comin your way, to enter your brain
And let a word remain, as a syllable
Stuck deep inside
The more I go on I'll pluck inside
Your skull, and damage your ears
Cause I burn, you know that Ced

[Ced Gee]
Word up man, you burn man, yo yo man
You really did burn that track up man, but you know uhh
My man TR Love is in the house and uhh
Moe Luv's in the house
Awesome Two, they in the house
Uhh, who else in the house?
My man Paul C, he got the bass pumpin, uhh
Who else?  Brother Kevvy Kev, uhh

[Ced Gee]
Yeah everybody man
London, St. Louis, ahh, we out of here man
