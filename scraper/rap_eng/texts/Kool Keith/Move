[Kool Keith]
Yes
Aww yeah
Navigation defect
Boost out the maximum motherfuckin power
X-ray log intruder, what's the control?
There's your number, leave the three, general justice
Piss in your tosh system, neon lights shine
Glow in the dark, urination, wet up the computer
Oversearch, cosmic sensational
Watch your bitch squat
Distorters move they thongs off
Who that captain up front?  Watch who the kid
Counteract, take a shit in the cockpit
Underarm aroma with the dark pit
Don't let me bounce like
Y'know, catch a clock with
Yeah, people jock shit
My pen control the forces
My stamina burn your sources

[Chorus 2X: Marc Live]
Move, get out, run for cover
Break out, call your mother, stop talkin
Don't come in the area, bomb terrible
Lose your mind, count your blessings, this is mental

[Kool Keith]
Yeah, the song repeat, the public complain
Every jam is whack, the piss, comin on the number ten station
The number one nation, shit turds
On B-E-S spins like Casey Kasem
Hand y'all the records
Shove all that bullshit up your asshole
Local bastard with upset stomach who barely fart gold
On new hot nine, old release the SCUD missile
Shittin the toilet tissue, defecation is the issue
My dick rise up, in the condom with elevation
I make money, like you hustle
My way up, ride planes bitch like you you and you
Open your fuckin package, ground delivery
FedEx KFC bucket full of horse shit
The farm send you motherfuckers the turtles
I give you doodoo, kidnap with voodoo
Hold your diarrhea blast, come straight forth
Bitch, cock your ass, chocolate brown
Cover your white poodle, fuck you
Shove the bullshit playlist up your boo boo
Plastic ass nigga, you ain't accurate ass nigga
That clown-ass buildin beside track, he get sidetracked
Lick dick fast nigga cut grease
Twelve inches fucked up, Marc turn that shit off, they suck
Play me, when you get that grey beard
I don't give a fuck

[Chorus] w/ echo
