[Intro]
Yeah, a lot of people smoking blunts
Sitting lost, with no inspiration
They never had it
Even when they thought they had it
Deep in their heart
Their wack inside, the interior
I rip them down

[Verse 1]
Power and force make a nigga mad, man
I, I'm up top, your man come and get the grab bag
I'm Kanye, I move the west west
Girls show me your chest, people show me the best
You're just a P-popper, double nigga hopper, what's up
You may want to flow off south of the border
Lyrical warmup, the king see the wings that span
Like a bird, I fly like a hawk
Come down and pick up New York
Take it in the sky
Bye bye bye-bye-bye bye-bye-bye
Wrap you like a baby up
Man, you in a blanket, rank it
Nigga think he nice making records, stank bitch
Like Run DMC, I'm the king
Break them down to a puny leg
Got his girl going stinky, right
Get in the ring, I'm winky, fuck off

[Hook]
American disaster
European disaster
American disaster
European disaster
Disaster
American
European disaster
Who can rock, who can rock
Who can rock, who can rock
Who can rock, who can rock
Who can rock, who can rock

[Outro]
Jigga, I set the tables up
You've got to get on this, this ain't vocoder
