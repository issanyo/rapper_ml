With my grey hair, blue hand
Face the colour lilac
I'm driving down Hollywood Boulevard in a metallic Cadillac
Gorilla funk massive one monkey as a passenger
LAPD looking at me
And say "what's happening?" Y'all see me following the lime green Volkswagen, with black dots on it with baby dinosaurs sitting on it
Bugs and birds climbing up on a yellow Bugs Bunny rabbits
Running from the headlights from Warner Brothers
Windshield wipers go back and forth
(?) go way down on the others
Mr. Gerbik eating laundry detergent
Dr. Octagon's uncle pull up and get gas at the service
The leader of the gargoyles, watch me wild make a right turn
Expansion 58-wings-589, my fingers look like Bigfoot hands on the stop sign
Pedestrians pay me no mind

Chorus
Hollywood Tailswinging
Dinosaurs march, we run that Boulevard

Off the cliff, I see the Hollywood sign
Bosses run, alligators start flying
Popeyes with vampires with fangs out
I see the walking dead, 64 pounds of turkey meat and straw cornbread
The torso of the gamma-ray wildebeest
In spare the light coming down
The highlands, a woman with glow in the dark dreads
Rocket tank with half man shark legs
Altitude tornado, coming down in the milky way
Crackhouse house with these boom bass foxes  eating hydrox cookies to ox's
Cannonball express we can launch dist the laser beam addition powerpack over the competition
Elevator coming down from the aircraft on a mission
Activate four sharks scheming from Great Britain

Chorus
Hollywood Tailswinging
Dinosaurs march, we run that Boulevard

My brain hybrids saving gasoline
My body run on iguana kerosene
Automatic lizards with a tennis
California Mr. Gerbik controlling Sasquatches
Walking through the blizzards with buzzards in dozens
Flexing muscles with turtles in duffles
Like the orange orangutan cuddled in huddles
The extra-terrestrial highly activated invertebrae
My 74-667 antifreeze eye contract
The isolation will go aerodynamically
Like a hawk grabbing a target off the pavement
(squawks)
The parallel park pterodactyls walking down through Melrose
With molecules opening the L-Zone
High titanium extra chromosomes with
Panoramic visions in the view
This is what i do..

Chorus
Hollywood Tailswinging
Dinosaurs march, we run that Boulevard
