[Verse 1]
Microsoft acetate, she got a nice ass and waist
Center I gotta pick it up like the Barclay, hip hop hooray
The dock into the Mandalay was sway
The text spray air wake I parlay
They still ride around confused over Safaree
Lamp with Sadé
Y’all wearing Buster Brown
I'm wearin' Maur-ay's
My testes got a line going down like a sting ray
Call Betty I’m ready at chicken and Corsetti
She went on pretty
Like Doctor Doo-Litty
I’m driving too silly
Right over your city
Filmin’ a bitty
Of women and titties
My masquerade
She Anne-Marie my escapade
The Cadillac roll, the Escalade
The baggage full with hands and legs
Disguise myself with longer braids
The jump shot fade
Gabrielle at the Western Union
I’m pulling up playin’ in girls bras like Dwayne Wade
The rockstar with coats with strange coll-ars
At the end I like my

[Chorus]
Polka dot Volkswagen
Leer jet seats
Rocket launchers
Chemical warfare
Earth automation
Polka dot Volkswagen
Leer jet seats
Rocket launchers
Chemical warfare

[Verse 2]
Like Dave Grohl
My beard grow to my vocal tone
Panda bears answer my phone
Whoever’s blind I’ma leave you to show Stevie Wonder home
Put ears near the metronome
And lay up on the white couch
Like a white man versus a grey mouse
I can send my balls we hearin’ them through PayPal
Many fight back
Space man living through crack vials
Central command sound like Russian voodoo Kevin Lyles
Unless you unknown ladies want my cream on their coconut mounds
She talk so big like she could fit Godzilla in her mouth
Psychiatrist say she left her stained underwear up in Usher’s house
If you’re army why you hidin’ behind other mouse
Me and Automator goin’ to the President’s house
While people move their bowels slow to get their product out
Too many wanna be Jimi Hendrix let ‘em rock out
Like Bill Parcells
The duration in this time after the song
Watch cats come out finicky and resign
They see me with the wig and glasses
Riding that polka dot Volkswagen I’m [?]

[Verse 3]
Convertible beater bug lover
Undercover in a romance with this beautiful type of mama
The porno star genre
Body like Takara
Drive by I’ma hit that tomorrow
She get that butt bit off like piranha
Doctor’s laying out with the black briefcase in the sauna
Rock call me the one-man Nirvana
The crowd throw out they vaginas
Rappers wait onstage with sweat in their pantyliners
I haul hogs from San Francisco to South Carolina
Paint rap in the butt crack with a good primer
Over all the famous panties
We take a leak on your best designers
Y’all block reppin it with second hand rhymers
From Atlantic to Capitol
Even Def Jam I laugh at you
[?] stunt the ball over your mama like Daryl
Seahawker stalker
Wear my helmet in the VW
I’m in love with you
Clean the engine you know how I cruise

[Chorus]
