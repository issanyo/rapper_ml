Yeah, never less as I come in my green Cadillac
With my purple cape
Un-circumcised with no rain coat
With no underwear, prepare for the Phantom
With yo big eyes ha huh ha huh, yeah

As I lyrical flip my body never wear underwear
Girls stare, I pluck in they public hair
The masquerade I'm crazy with a switch blade
I cut jaws the face of a wild shark
I love Cal Can, "Roof!", can a dog bark

I'll bite ya girl make a women catch rabies
Then eat Gerber from a jar like the babies
I like cereal, yo you Captin' Crunch
Juggle my jellybeans, yo captain munch

I like roach spray mixed in my gin and juice
You better go get spray and make it strong
My tractor trailer, my private piece is quite long

I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes

As I masturbate every time about 8
The last time I masturbated through the earthquake
I saw your picture girl Shirley Temple Jheri Curl
You walk around through a toilet and a do do world

I know the spokes are white a green Cadillac
Polka dot grey I'm satisfied I won't take it back
I need the mustard from the Whataburger
I spell it backwards I take my girl to King Burger

You better rush on in an order fries
Before I get mad and start peein' in your eyes
Like Gomer Pile, surprise, surprise

You seen my drawers of course you see my rubber
No fat stretch marks I ain't the one you got the blubber
"What the hell am doin', I telling you that?"

I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes

I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes

Missile check I'm aimin' four to your rectum
With mexican beans collard greens I respect 'em
You hold the apples while girls pull they pants down
I got a bottles of flies I'm throwin' ants down

Like Joe said one time I'm drinkin' straight rum
Chewin' they embryo, actin' like it's bubble gum
I get inside, bark and crank the truck
Cruz up the highway, you out there you stuck

You ain't the one I got no cables no goose
Look in the back I got no room, see my moose
I better hide what's left at 7 Eleven
Call the Ranger, the Phantom at 11

He got black boots and stains on my turtle-neck
My mink is yellow and tan female birds peck
I got no rags to clean I love the vomit
It makes me sexy, my underwear atomic

You smell the rose, I'm smellin' cookin' flower
I call your house and let it ring for an hour
I got to clean up my house set the mouse traps
I know one he's grey and cool and the mouse raps
I seen 'em seen 'em I seen 'em through peripheral vision

I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes

I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes
I look around the corner and see your big eyes

Yes, stop peepin' around in my window, I see you lookin'
I got no shades, he's comin' after me
Yeah huh huh, I see you, stop peepin' in my windows
(Who's there)
All my neighbors, I hear voices
(Stay out my business)

Little people talkin' to me
Stay out my business
I be going to see the doctor tomorrow
