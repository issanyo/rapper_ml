You know women are like
You know women are like apples
They're like fruit when you go to the store
I dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble
Pick out the apples
I dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble
Pick out the apples, apples, apples

I did the game already before they made Parker Brothers
You bought the Donny Pizo, ruin the game
I put the first man on the moon, presented new in the game
In the back war to watch
When the mink got stained I tricked the money off
With the ladies for the breast surgery, gave the woman a brain
Right beside your toilet, my rubber remain
I reduce the lower rate, and eatin rate, but my status gain
Four tiny pieces in a bucket
Hit the In-N-Out Burger, get in the carpool lane
Beyond the average dust smoker, '73 cats put down the cocaine

[Nancy Des Rose]
Lyrical fiction is what they call it, poetical phrase that you inhale
Steadily lettin the words flow to your brain
Ladies not being true to their game
Liars, cheaters and deceivers blindfoldin women, prayin on weak players
Girls hatin the next level vibe like I'm from some other tribe
Too blessed to be stress ladies and gents
I'm comin at you like a glass of milk with Oreos, I need a sweettooth
I know you just wanna say my name, lady fame
Droppin gold metaphors while you do your chores
As I step up I made you sweat so hot better lick your fingers before you touch
Master telepathic energy tantalizing your, lymphatic sensory
Unlike any other female I'm no chick
I don't walk around thinkin I got a dick, the strictly fancy, lady
I get nasty instead of being crafty
Keep up your, optimism can't no one curse, me
Thinkin they can put me in a hearse, God's got me
He'll never leave me, nor forsake me, like they say
{*foreign language*} Stay focused on your goal
Stop sweatin other hoes, just rock your flow, get your own glow
My message grows like a seed planted deep inside of you
Open your mind to a new sound, lyrical prose and verse

[Kool Keith]
And verse
You know how girls are
Sometimes get complex, but we still the supermarket, and
I dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble
(Dibble and dabble) Check out my apples
I dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble
Dibble and dabble, check out the apples
CHECK~! out the apples
Check out the apples, whoahhohh

Some of the cartoon Fat Albert shirt-ass monkies
Think of the new wave overnight gangsta visit, the grave
Man you get the face, you need a close shave, go back in your hut
Think you're jealous cause I'm like Liu Kang
The man can't scratch a cut, that's right, when I get into that butt
You see the kid, like a squirrel out there you're tryin to get a nut
That's right, we come, that's right, we take girls out to Pizza Hut
We get 'em down, with the sound, groove Uptown
Northbound to the Bronx, Boogie Down, we kick to the left and right
That's right, lyrics come tight
