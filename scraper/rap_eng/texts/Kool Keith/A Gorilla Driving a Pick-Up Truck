[Kool Keith]
G mob been drivin tractor trailer for years
It's true, I've seen him, green Ram
Gorilla drivin a pick-up truck
70 on the speedometer, 16 gears
Drivin for 7 centium Mayflower
Peterbilt's rollin, I'm sweatin
I'm about to vomit on the highway
I seen the rearview mirror drivin towards Texas my way
Him chewin bananas, wearin a bandana
A speedchase, truck runnin two hundred ki's
Loaded down with produce
Diesel gas with juice
I can't stop, he put his pass up
Runnin over reindeers
Head on with a moose
Wilson, the tree, runnin next to the caboose
Big load behind me
I'm lonely, I'm on my CB radio talkin to goose

Gorillas following me
Gorillas behind me

{*scratching*}

I'm lookin for a truck stop
There's nothin in sight
Tryin to get up the road with all my might
I'm lookin at the side angle
Hopin my wheels don't tangle
I opened up the can, I reached back in my sleeper
And grabbed a can of Rango
I was movin fast
He got on fire, the gorilla looked at me and passed
He was on my ass
I looked at my tank, my tank was on E
Runnin uphill I got slow, my gas got empty
I had enough fuel to duel
He tryin to pass me
Lookin in the left mirror, lookin in the right mirror
I won't even make an error
He's changin left, he's changin right
I cut him off on the side
He's throwin bananas under my wheels
I'm slidin goin down those Texas heels

Gorillas lookin at me
Driving behind me
