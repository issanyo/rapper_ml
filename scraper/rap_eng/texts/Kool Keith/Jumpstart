[Kool Keith]
Adjust two levels, with immobile chemicals
That y'all pass to Saturn, relax for your physical

See you hatin with night vision
Masters at Work meet you in division
Heavy writing, deadly fumes in position
Jumpstart

Nuclear so-lar power, dressed like the Terminator
One programmed robot, one hour
Get out the fire extinguisher
The New York Police Department save your valuables
I'll face the exe- exe- exe- executioner

Mack- Mack- Mack- Mack trucks blow up later
I'll show up with stable contacts and Argent tech
You pass off the building contracts
While the drummer lays the "Critical Beatdown"
{*"lays the Critical Beatdown"*} conditioned horn section
You're in position

Jumpstart {*8X*}

Can't find the funkin {*2X*}
Can't find the funkin towel

Can't find the funkin towel
Kinetic sector session, we face the election
American Express therapeutic campaign
Ultimate plutonium, uranium, blew my, carbon dioxide
Is the qualified
For MC's, you better drink that Drano {*2X*}
For MC's, you better drink that- that
That... that... that... unclogger
Roll the wheelchair like Ironside
Wash your whack baseball cap with Tide
Behind the thin curtains and small blinds you can't hide
Pain match up to the hater with tight-ass gym shorts on
Look at you lookin like the Gladiator
{*"Look at you lookin like the Gladiator"*}
My pee stains turn yellow on foes and perform greater
While you control the testicles with the handles from Sega

Jumpstart {*14X*}
Nice

Jumpstart, nice
Jumpstart, jumpstart, nice
Jumpstart, nice
Jumpstart, jumpstart, nice

One, two
One, two
One, two
One, two~!
That's for all you Richie tan figures
