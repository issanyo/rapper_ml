[Verse 1: Showboat Blastoff]
Well its Wednesday again ive been sitting flaccid for most of the week
Chilling on my cheeks
And I already prank  phone called the geek from dawsons creek
“Hello, my name is Larry I got your bluray box set in my hand
Your personal number was in the liner notes
Would you like to join me for some corn on the cob”
Into another room
Where I recently sharted
Wang in hand for the rare case that I get carded
That’s when the lightbulb goes off!
Lets take this joke to the streets  and bring the cars to a screech
But first I gotta change into sweats pants if im gonna entertain you pissants
(sing) Now im telling you right off the bat
This is gonna be hilarious
Theres no way  this could be a dud
I got my pud on scud (UHHHH)
Omy god they love me love me this at the laundry mat
Note to self cure that itch with a tube  a tube of monostat
And if your street cred dips below two hundred its time
To stiffen up and walk the streets you are optimus prime
Then campaign! Shake peoples hands like you were running for re-election
Flexing in the intersection with an erection

[Hook: Showboat Blastoff]
When Im at the grocery store
Check out my erection
Check out my erection
Check out my erection
When Im at the traffic light
Check out my erection
Check out my erection
Check out my erection

[Verse 2: Showboat Blastoff]
Ignore all the crap I got going on in my lap
I make a bold move and point to my crotch and say “Hoss, I think you need to talk to the boss”
Hes not happy with the current Takahiro Report,  best case scenario he’ll reassign you
Elevator eyes up from my lobby to my kimosabe
Fully sweatpantsed stranger in the streets eating pizza like Stacey Keech
I’m handing out the smelling salts improving, improving the town
Mental clipboard gets a check when your eyes get caught panning down
Pinnochio in my pants, as I hammer hammer dance now
I got you all in a trance, your all going to be late for work now
Inner pocket material is hanging out looking like an elephant, its sooo relevant
Even at the zoo the owls hard time telling whos who
Squash those skinny jeans, I need a loose fitting garment
For maximum surprise hit off the costume department
This isn’t sexual release, im out here performing a social experiment
Im daring you to stare at it
It has a calming effect when you reflect on me being erect
So before you call the cops, you need to pause and realize
That while all you bros are out pounding Strohs, im straight making history with my pachaderm nose

[Hook: Showboat Blastoff]
When Im at the grocery store
Check out my erection
Check out my erection
Check out my erection
When Im at the traffic light
Check out my erection
Check out my erection
Check out my erection

[Verse 3: Showboat Blastoff]
In my cubicle again, its 8 am and I already already finished my bagel
Theres a birthday party being planned in conference room B
Looks like my entire intramural basketball teams all in there
I think I’ll grow and show again! Uh oh here we go again!

[Verse 3: Kool Keith]
Erection killer bone hard
Magnum man
So large
Park the car
See my balls
Girls wet with phone cords
All of y’all menopause
Condom with those bus tours
Showboat out with ladies on with hard on
Erection with the milk white
Fit in her real nice
Let her pay the freak price
Eating cooking freak rice
Hard like that monster
Pop star condom
Lubrication boner strip club owner
You kill my boner
Hard to the uterus
Show you how i do with this
Baby you look cute with this
Show me how you work your lips
