[Intro]
Yo, whassup? This is Dr. Dooom
I know I killed Dr. Octagon
Now, how they gon' come back with some type of return?
That's why I'm back
I'mma put the finishing touches on this guy
You witness the execution
("Rest in peace"*)

[Verse 1]
This is a true story—how I put the clamp on Octagon
Drowned him in the water until he was gone
Then he came back alive
I stabbed him over 17 times
But you people out there wouldn't let him die
Y'all put him on the respirator
The critics that gave him mouth to mouth—resuscitation was a hater
Dreamworks signed him to a major
Tony Isobel and Dan wanted to adopt him from the hospital
Again—Two weeks later, Dr. Octagon was dead
Electrocuted by electric razor
Octagon is gone, this image was pawned (Clearance rack)
Every now and then I go visit him in the cemetery
On and on

[Hook: Dr. Dooom + sample]

("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased
No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased

No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased
No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased

[Verse 2]
Me and Kurt seen him at the hospital yesterday
I pulled the plug out on Dr. Oc'
He was good as the creator, but a bunch of people didn't know
I beat him to death with rocks
In a sock, left him for dead on some alternative block
With some bad parents from Germany and Swiss
That wanted him to go candy-pop—something called candy-hop
The world was forcin' a nightmare down people's throats
That had to stop!
They got excited everytime somethin' that was created in three days
Would drop
A Yoo-Hoo and donuts
I had two hundred thousand people goin' so nuts
To the extreme, they tried to duplicate the same record
I had to check it

[Hook: Dr. Dooom + sample]
No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased
No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased

No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased
No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased

[Verse 3]
With all the rock bands offering their condolences
To the producers of The Return
I had to overshadow their credits, and wait my turn
On the worthless, now Dr. Dooom has risen, after this
The universe will hear the long-awaited LP
The truth and the surface
To be announced, the massage on your brain
Plus the sabotage

[Hook: Dr. Dooom + sample]
No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased
No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased

No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased
No wack remixes or duplicated copies
("Rest in peace") Octagon is deceased

[Outro]
Octagon is deceased
