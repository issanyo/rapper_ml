[Kool Keith]
New York City (K double-O L) y'know, y'know
(Keith Productions) two step, two step girl
Two step, two step!
Two step, two step girl
Two step, two step!
Two step, two step - it's no Octo
An ark this time
Everybody just yo' watch and clock this time
Girl with the big ass - she's on the jock this time
Suede front vest, sharkskin with the slacks - with the moc' this time
Bust the bottles, spin the top this time
How much you light up, what you cop this time
Move on your best ho, I drop this dime
Your face on the floor, I drop this time
You can't copy?  I'll mark this mine
You think I'm sharp with pointy ears like a Klingon; Mr. Spock is fine
Big as Calvin - some can't deal with my Klein
I'ma tell in a rhyme, the stores are stocked up
Ready for distribution, pro manufacturing, I sell in a rhyme
Plastic around my CD's fit in D-cups
Bras on double D's I move like a doc this time
In permanent position, move you out the spot this time
I hate to tell you man you're not hot this time
Your hype man will sleep on a Motel 6, cot this time
Beans won't cook in the frying pan right man
You better use the pot this time
Can't trade heads with you, because you don't got this mind
When I keep goin, you don't stop this time
Heads bop and rock this time
Clean floors up, I'ma mop this time
Go in the club?  I'ma play the parking lot this time
You can't rap no no, cartoon characters not this rhyme
Two step, two step girl
Two step, two step!
Two step, two step girl
Two step, two step this time!
