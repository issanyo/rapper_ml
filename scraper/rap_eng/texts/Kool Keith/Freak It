Yo what's goin' on?
I seen what yous was doing
What's goin' on on the corner, how's work out there?
Yeah I'm a see you tonight, take care, you know
Alright

Hey Big Louie, Joey The Man the master mack
I got them broads with legs up in a Cadillac
I turn 'em doggy style, I turn 'em doggy wild
I bought 'em somethin' to eat I made 'em smile

They wanna dance double check in a local bar
That's my scene the phantom in a Go Go Bar
Like Luke said I got ta take a sky walker
Pumps and bumps, action man I'm no talker

You seen Benny around, he owe my honey's money
I'm here for business, yo boss go get Big Sonny
I'm into movies, yo Kurt start the camcorder
Take of those panties, yo baby start the tape recorder

I'm into Dannon yo girls taste the yogurt
I don't come quick, professionals control it
And who's these singers singin' up in my club

Now put this teddy on, this red and black baby doll
With your high heel shoes, don't worry you won't fall
I must admit cha, I have to take a picta
When you walk away , I see your left eye switch a

I must say you are ready fro bondage
As I pull your hair and watch you stretch
You look around see the mask of the phantom
The skills to your bedroom, I must plant 'em

I look in windows and views with binoculars
I seen you wash up one time and a spot you miss
You don't know, I seen you in a video
With MC Hammer, my man Joe, here we go

I know you see me, I drive a green Cadilliac
With Tender Vittels, you bound to catch a mack smack
Yo where's Wille at, the blunt and the Phillie at?
I got employees with me selling kitty kat

C'mon girl, jump I like a groupie
No basket ball star, yo man she ain't doofy
C'mon and see the player swinger show
Forget them slow jams yo f that singer show
I come lay in the spot with now drawers

Let me tell you a little bit of somethin' in your ear one time
(Yeah)
I'm a tell ya a little something
Let me tell ya, come here

My pockets loaded I'm leanin' rollin' in a Caddy
The P I M P flex the phantom mack daddy
I seen her walk in the clubs with through hips
Yo Pepsi Cola come here lem me take sips

Get up there girl, yo work it, yo work it when you tap dance
Come on and sit down the owner want a lap dance
I tip big don't get me mad you smoke a cig
Yo Big Ben drops checks and Franky drive a rig

I'm swingin' intimate, I got the east coast
Yo hand me that phone control 'n panties on the west coast
I got no lyrical time, aye yo you waste time
I got a meet 'n with some business on my mind

I got this taste for greens to feel a bill
Money in rubber bands you people think i'm ill
I'm keepin' close to home she in a Cadillac
I'd rather live well with big steaks in a stack

Yo Jack yo give me some credit, put your bet up
I got 'em all dancin' freaky Dee's workin' sweat up
It's easy baby three records get you live
Make 'em spend second pockets and step if they get jive

I close down tonight, you stop that fools fight
If you come in wild, don't play you bring it right
I pull your card, pluck your feathers and your crap game

Leavin' you cold with no diamonds and your gold
Don't touch my women Franky, play with my money
