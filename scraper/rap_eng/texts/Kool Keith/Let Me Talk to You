Libra
My name is Keith
Yo Mo, you sagittarius
We gotta do some nice things for the ladies
Take 'em out they yo
Here's five dollars, man, go get the ladies some flowers and stuff
Other people don't love them like we do, we care

I never hurt you talk to you decent at night
And in the daytime I'll watch you while you sunbathe
And if it rains I'll bring you straight up out the water girl
Let me bring you in the house and make some cocoa, rub your your back
I am stupid-stacked, you know I got my weight up
I'm pushin over 300 just to keep my endurance level when we hit the sheets
You got the fireplace, I'm bringin fire in the place
Why can't it be me and you
I see your chocolate brown skin
I see your peanut-butter skin breast make me feel like a child, yo feed me
I bite your rigth cheak and leave a monkey bite eat off your left thigh
Why can't we be one 'til we die
And if we die why can't we multiply
And if we cry I make sure that a wild kid like me takes care of home on a tour date

(7x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

I'm not Babyface Jimmy Jam or the Lewis
When I look at you the sex man wanna do this
Taste you up and down
Bite the honey brown
Get your hair done so we can go and have fun
Pull the grill out and everybody chill out
Got to play the little prince
Marvin Gaye, sexual healing
You on the blanket, ready for the fingering
Holding you in the grass whith your silk bra jingeling
I got a fruit cocktail for your stomach
Some jellies and juicy fruits for bellies when I rub it
I lick you there where he won't
We lick you there where he don't
Bringing extra underwear to the picnic
I'm into Ecstasy we can get love sick
So quick mick and hop on my ohhhhhh

(7x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

In the bathtub looking for your bubble bath
With a condom you bout to make me wonder
Woman I drink your bath water like a beaver otter
And pop the bubbles in your bath with my index finger
Drinking cups of tea by the fireplace
My hand in your slot, touching on the right place
The G-spot I know you got a lot of loving hugging
Your juices ooze how can I loose
When a woman loves a man
She'll bring her best friend with lingerie over to your house
When a woman loves a man, she'll clean the grime off of your feet

(4x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

Yeah baby you know I respect you for
Going with me to Burger King
Ride with me in my little jalopy you know
Sticking by me, through thick and thin
Yeah you know going to White Castle and stuff
Me and Motion riding around in a little 65 Chevy
Can't afford them Benzes we can only fantasize
So you won't need them brothers
