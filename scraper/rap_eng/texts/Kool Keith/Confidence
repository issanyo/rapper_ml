Get it up, y’all, and let’s bounce to this
Get it up, y’all, and let’s bounce to this
Get it up, y’all, and let’s bounce to this
Get it up, y’all, and let’s bounce

Rhyme style is erroneous to the mainstream
Real estute on the mic when I display things
Partner, I'ma tell you the phoniest people try at it
They need help from another artist to sky at it

I retain the service alertness of my own presence
I need me in the mix, mix down to master
Look up in the mirror for emcees as a role caster
I'ma hire myself, do everything
Like a youngster when he changing his life to go into a gang
I jump myself in, I put a beat on myself, myself knuckle-up
I can’t cheat on myself, myself better than
Yea, better than, better than
Adversaries and closest bretheren
My motis operandi
A good supply
Of emotions with a cadence and tone and element surprise
It sounds foreign for you
Could be friendly, misleading, or end gory for you

Instrumental, MC, microphone
Confidence, confidence
Athlete, big game, it’s on
Confidence, confidence
Interview, new job, control
Confidence, confidence
Whatever it is that you do
Confidence, confidence

We might line up to play curtis[?] like Peyton Manning
Audible with his beat, styles vary some
He confident in tossing my way, I’m Marvin Harrison
I’m the recipient, raised, born omnipotent
So sore on the docs, I'ma change my name to “Ridiculous”
Man, yea wake up and kill it
Like yo grandma in the kitchen
That’s cooking old school with the iron skillet
I got food for you
Email me a topic, I’ll set the mood for you
From lover dudes to a menace I’m guaranteed
To bring the ultimate sentence, from start until finish

So, what you saying?
Even in vowel [?], as when you was still (an) apprentice, you wouldn’t survive in my clinic
Man I’ll finish
I might get lit and expose myself as napalm
Ready to gel and explode
Make a demand
Count the rappers on the floor and exact to it like Rain Man
It sounds perplex
Maybe you’re just dislex-Sick

Get it up, y’all, and let’s bounce to this
Get it up, y’all, and let’s bounce to this
Get it up, y’all, and let’s bounce to this
Get it up, y’all, and let’s bounce

Instrumental MC microphone
Confidence, confidence
Athlete, big game, it’s on
Confidence, confidence
Interview, new job, control
Confidence, confidence
Whatever it is that you do
Confidence, confidence

(Armed and equipped with much confidence)
