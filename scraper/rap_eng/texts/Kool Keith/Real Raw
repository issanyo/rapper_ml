[Intro: Sample]
"Check it, check it"
"Check it, back is the funky ex-flower"

[Verse 1: Dr. Octagon]
With yellow eyes, my green face, my pink and white afro
I'm no toy kid, your style is made by Hasbro
Gnip Gnop, you think you got that real hip-hop
I soar the chart so quickly, watched your album flop
I'm Doctor Octo', curlin' weights, tourin' rhinos
Liftin' horses, throwin' cows at your fake forces
You know my gold style, rabbit fur coat style
You be freezin' with the flu watch you keep sneezin'
Like Breezly Brewin', your style I'mma have to ruin
Chop up your tactics, you gimmick groups need to practice
You beat it, like Michael Jackson in my atmosphere
Gerbils for rectums, I break you off like Richard Gere
I'm so fantastic, your metal fist is still plastic
Compelled with no threats, your rhymes bounce off my shield
New York City, California, roll my Ampex reel
No corny loops and assemble with Timberland boots
I'm strictly monster with turtlenecks like Frankenstein
Drop that mic kid, you lost, so that ass is mine

[Hook]
I get real raw
Change arrangements on your face
I get real raw
Change arrangements on your face
I get real raw
Change arrangements on your face
I get real raw
Change arrangements on your face
Superspeed
Flowin'!

"Check it, check it"
"The rhythm is nice"

[Verse 2: Dr. Octagon]
Doctor Octo', mental disorder, person in alias
Fifty-five-six computer tracks on your ass cracks
Bellevue patient ignored your rhymes in the train station
You don't want none, the vomit's on your cinnamon bun
You still rappin' in the city talkin' pig latin
In fact you no test, you tired man, won't you rest?
Take that sleep with NoDoz, that common style is cheap
You bought your mic cord, payola scams the Billboard
Slots that's not hot, you settle for the nuts you got
Record releases, your crew is wack like chocolate Reese's
Urine stains are spread out, fly colours on your brains
You beware, orangutans tappin' on your window
Bulls and coyotes, while roaches walk around your poodle
Like Shakespeare, genius thoughts pumpin' every year
MCs know, retire quick rap like Paul Monroe
Joe C. Meriweather with blocks on your skin is clever
Upright direction, I battle any yeast infection
Put missiles to work, my needles in your midsection
Hold upright, I burn your anus with the purple light
Use up your power, make phone calls for an hour

[Hook]
I get real raw
Change arrangements on your face
I get real raw
Change arrangements on your face
I get real raw
Change arrangements on your face
I get real raw
Change arrangements on your face

[Outro: Sample]
"Check it, back is the funky ex-flower"
"Check it, back is the funky ex-flower"
"Check it, back is the funky ex-flower"
"Check it, back is the funky ex-flower"
"Check it, back is the funky ex-flower"
"Check it, back is the funky ex-flower"
