[Hook: Spose]
This the new high score
The old champion, he ain't champ no more
This the new high score
Whoever used to matter, they don't matter no more
(What's that?) This the new high score
The old champion, he ain't champ no more
This the new high score
And everything that came before, well that shit was cute

[Verse 1: Spose]
I pushed quarters in, pressed start and it was game over
I spawn, conquer, rocket launcher, flame thrower
Every player get eviscerated
Dropping out the top ten as soon as I participated
I'm feeling like I play Immortal Kombat, bomb tracks, gone last
Long after I'm gone, I've been spittin' missiles
Recognize I wreck a rhyme, I beat a level second time
In record time, then what I do? Enter my initials
You better do some cool shit quick
'cause my name in bold at the top of the list
I enter "SPZ," I came to win
Oh shit, you just did something lame again
What's that? That's the new high score
I'm Hacksaw Jim Duggan with two-by-fours
The Pac-Man dots ate like two times four
I could hear the quarters shaking when I'm walking in the door

[Bridge: Spose]
Hundred, billion, zillion points
You got shied like Illinois

[Hook: Spose]
This the new high score
The old champion, he ain't champ no more
This the new high score
Whoever used to matter, they don't matter no more
(What's that?) This the new high score
The old champion, he ain't champ no more
This the new high score
And everything that came before, well that shit was cute

[Verse 2: Spose]
That new high score, all I'm all about, look it
I'm Mario with more coins than couch cushions
I'm Buck Hunter, every yellow cup of Yellowstone
I'm Sonic with more rings than telephones
Zelda's home, point zillionaire
The first quarters that I ever put in still in there
They're like, "It isn't fair," I'm like, "Oh yes, it is"
They skeptive to the same game you labelled unimpressiveness
The best at this, you [?]
Game over like Lil Flip
I played the whole season while they scrimmagin'
You looking for that new high score, right there, that's my penmanship
Every player came before me is irrelevant
In the peanut gallery room and I'm the elephant
Spit automatic, never need to reload
Spawned on blaze, let him reign, no cheat codes

[Outro: Spose]
The who?
The pinball wizard, he got the new high score
Holy shit balls, Bridget
Me and losing, well that's a odd couple
