[Verse 1: Spose]
Ayup, I've been tracking the package, waiting for this to happen
Since before I got kicked out of band and started rappin'
I wanted this before I ever wanted (pussy)
Now I had the latter, but look how long it took me
Twenty-two long years on this blue green thing
I sketched a thousand rough drafts, 'bout to do these things
I clicked the tracking number, almost jumped up out the chimney
When I saw the status data out for delivery, it's on
I put so much work and years into these songs
'bout to do something right, I did so much wrong
The UPS man went ding-dong
I opened the door, I ran with the package up to my room
Two hundred copies of my first album in plastic, man, I did it!

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Finally did something right! (right)
Finally did something right! (right)
Used to do things wrong, but now I
Finally did something right!
Finally did something right!
Thought that I'd be bad, but now I
Finally did something right!
Finally did something right! (did something right!)
Used to do things wrong, but now I

[Verse 2: Spose]
I walked outside for the first time in days
Cold February morning, sun on my face
I finally got a purpose after losing my way
My daughter born healthy, now all my fear gone away
I'm feeling like some clarity is building up inside of me
Been high for so long, I feel high off sobriety
My teens, twenties, drinking, self medicatin'
This hospital stay, sober, been intoxicatin'
Feels sweet
I see my breath as I exhale, I feel free
I smile as I grab the car keys
And then proceed to fight this carseat
I struggle, it's buckled, it's safe, isn't movin'
I went from no purpose to the dad of a human, I feel like

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Finally did something right! (right)
Finally did something right! (right)
Used to do things wrong, but now I
Finally did something right!
Finally did something right!
Thought that I'd be bad, but now I
Finally did something right!
Finally did something right! (did something right!)
Used to do things wrong, but now I

[Bridge: Spose & Dave Gutter]
Finally did something right!
Shout out to Jaw Gems
Never too late to get it right, right?
You still got something left
You got anything left in the tank, you might as well keep goin'
You could something right before you're out of here, bro
See, I download the Jaw Gems, bumping the beat
Made an album in like less than a week, got me feeling like I

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Finally did something right! (right)
Finally did something right! (right)
Used to do things wrong, but now I
Finally did something right!
Finally did something right!
Thought that I'd be bad, but now I
Finally did something right!
Finally did something right! (did something right!)
Used to do things wrong, but now I
