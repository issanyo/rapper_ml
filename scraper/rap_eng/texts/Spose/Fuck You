[Spose]
Uh, girl, yeah yeah
We smoked it all

[Hook: Sample of CeeLo Green's "Fuck You"]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like "fuck you"
I guess the change in my pockets wasn't enough
I'm like "fuck you and fuck her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Now ain't that some shit (ain't that some shit)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "fuck you"

Spizzy Spose

[Verse 1: Spose]
It was all a dream
My backpack was L.L.Bean
I didn't think rap would mean tremendous cream
But then I wrote a song with no guns or pimpin'
And I got away with a hit, O.J. Simpson
Paid off my rhymes, now I can cop an Acura
Everything I've written isn't bitten like it's Dracula
It's accurate, I don't wanna fall like Niagara
So I'm going harder than some grandpas on Viagra
Leisure isn't my procedure, neither is the Visa
And my ego's never dieseled though I'm evil at the easel
And I'm equal to my peoples
Though I'm loco with my vocals
Breaking up the dojo like Yoko broke up The Beatles
Somebody pinch me, this can't be life
I spark the weed like it's candlelight
My life's like a virgin, Goddamn it's tight
I'm alright for the night, if you don't like me, I'ma say

[Partial auto-tuned hook: Spose]
Fuck you, Spizzy Spose in your mother's face
Fuck you, fuck your dad too
He's a bad dude, I heard he raped you
Auto-tune this shit tonight (ain't that some shit)

[Resumed CeeLo-sampled hook]
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "fuck you"

[Verse 2: Spose]
Look, I was broke in 2009
I had astounding rhymes for your pals in line
I want to blaze and freestyle, that sounds divine
I'm up in York County, Maine you are bound to find
Spose - big-ass nose, not arousing dimes
I've been to Bang Bros 'bout a thousand times
I think all your songs sound asinine
Is this the rap scene I'm supposed to galvanize?
I've never done that yet I'm down to try
My off-the-top shit left crowds surprised
And to the big drug dealer with a pound to buy
I got an eighth of the mersh from my town's supply
Most rap careers here get floundered down drains
Not found around fame, renowned around Maine
But me, I'm the show-stealing, concert burglar
Make your head Bob like it's Discount Furniture

[Hook: Sample of CeeLo Green's "Fuck You"]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like "fuck you"
I guess the change in my pockets wasn't enough
I'm like "fuck you and fuck her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Now ain't that some shit (ain't that some shit)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "fuck you"

[Verse 3: Spose]
Girl, you can find me sleeping at my mother's
Coming home blazed, get gluttonous on the cupboard
Sneak into my room with female and rubber
How things changed, the same place I first jerked under covers
How pleasant things ain't, debt collector got my cell number
Hunger for a million summers, got me calling out of work
Otherwise I'm cooking, wipe my forehead with my shirt
My mother never made supper, Alex, what is dessert?
But what bird confronted on a free birch to perch
Learned to live life and adulthood lurks
And that's mediocrity knocking
Because I'm hardly 2Pac and I do too much talking
He's rocking mics as doubters are mocking him
They say he burns trees like he hates oxygen
Dagnabbit, despite my bad habits
You can find me next to Spoon in your iPod gadget
I still got a bad taste in my pallet
I wonder "life, are you gonna go my way, like Lenny Kravitz?"
What a tangled web I weave
Spitting lies in the eyes of those I deceive
But lookey here, at last an MC so rare
With the truth in his face like emo hair
That campground, my mom played Pokeno there
Just to afford groceries, to Spose listen closely
My rhymes, my pen, my mom, my dad
Wonder if Maine Med would take me back
My town, my peeps, my past, my weed
Wonder what it'd take to get..shit
I don't know what I'm doing with my life
Spose
I don't know
