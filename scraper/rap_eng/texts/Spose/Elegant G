[Intro]
Yeah
There's no way
There's no way we could pay taxes on all these exotic animals and houses and shit
That's why we own the country
Altered G

[Verse 1]
Yo I dip the bald eagle meat all up in the Ranch dip
It's like I can't miss
Have sex with gold, checkered coat
Never broke, leopard coat
I been altered, G
You wanna reach me, you should call the suite
You should call it a beach, call it a yacht
Matter fact, you should probably call it a drop
I mean the drop-top helicop flyin' to the spot
Extravagant happenin's
Kardashians mowing my grass again
Immaculate castles
Long money like the cash from the [raffles?]
I seen young Prince on that helipad
Smokin' outta smelly bag
I could smell the doubt
I met up with Slouch on a velvet couch
With some elegant gentlemen
Smokin' elephant skeletons
Fuck with the tight boxes, white tuxes, White Russians
I been divin' for plasma diamonds
You cats survivin', I'm giant
Ate a whole shark, ain't ate one since
Cheese bliss with young Prince
Yellow limo with dark tints
Lair full of caged pelicans
Frigidaire full of AIDS medicine, on some altered shit
Titty size that is only in the Spanish alphabet
You know what I'm sayin', you don't know the half of it
I been looking for my next thrill
Chain so chunky I got it on a treadmill
It's oh so real
Suicide doors on the Popemobile
You never want a private jet
I just bought the company that owns MoÃ«t
Girls mo' wet
Us getting money 'round here, no sweat
It's Altered G, not Altered H
Preparation, we make no mistakes
Too fly to stop to hate
We got dinosaur milk in our Frosted Flakes
I don't got time for this
I don't got rhymes for this
So high that I'm up on Heaven
All my rhymes ghost-wrote by Jo...
[coughs] Got that manatee bone stuck in my throat there
All my rhymes ghost-wrote by John Lennon
