[Hook]
Do you wanna ride in my white limousine
Ride that unicorn up to the cash machine
Girl, you can call me Rick 'cause I'm the super freak
What's that motherfucking mime gonna do to me, girl

[Verse 1]
I roller-skate into the spot
Trillion-dollar mansion, tie-dyed tank top
I got my mustache studded with diamonds
Yachts, giraffes, and some decadent rhymin'
I got my bathrobe snug in some drugs
Lay your ass on this unicorn-skin rug
Spizzy Spose, I take it back
I'm in a big-ass fish tank, taking a nap
And Larry Bird came over, we got drunk
Rockin' knee socks and some fuckin' Reebok Pumps
White limousine so life's not borin'
Burt Reynolds on the snare, Chuck Norris on the chorus
Singing

[Hook]
Do you wanna ride in my white limousine
Ride that unicorn up to the cash machine
Girl, you can call me Rick 'cause I'm the super freak
What's that motherfucking mime gonna do to me, girl
