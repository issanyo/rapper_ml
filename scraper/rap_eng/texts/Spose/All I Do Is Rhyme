[Intro: Spose]
(Right now)
C'est la vie up in here
Je suis l'illest
(Right now)
Nous avon foumé tout le weed

[Hook: Spose]
All I do is rhyme, smoke my weed
And spend my time
Trying to get better than me
And I'd be fine
If I never made it, but I did
So I'll take credit ‘cause I changed my life
Now I'm doing alright

[Verse 1: Spose]
Look, I know you had a party and I'm sorry that I missed it
But these days I run a 24 hour, 7 day a week business
I won't even have a day off on Christmas
Just to make sure I got some milk on my Crispix
And I couldn't put it simpler
If you don't get it, forget it man, we must be dissimilar
I've been touring foreign places out of the perimeter
Just to get the bank account to mount another integer
(Minnesota!) Nobody told me it would not be tough
Backwoods with me and their broccolis stuffed
I got Macallan on ice like a hockey puck
I'll keep making it till haters are like, "Stop, enough!"
Try to copy us, they're see through
I see it clear, tell the engineer, "Keep the beat looped"
And look at hard times that I elude
No days off like I sold Chinese food

[Hook: Spose]
I just rhyme, smoke my weed
And spend my time
Trying to get better than me
And I'd be fine
If I never made it, but I did
So I'll take credit ‘cause I changed my life
Now I'm doing alright

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
‘Cause life's short, homie, and I don't have that time to lose
And I was out rhyming dude
While you were buying shoes and it's true
Who would ever want to rue in time
What do I do with mine? All I do is rhyme
Man, I'm doing fine, you gotta take that chance
And stay grinding harder than Jamaicans dance
I'm on stage playing for a lake of fans
While you're at home, naked with your snake in hand
Crammed in the studio, I keep the beat cranked
Yo, you smell that weed stank? Yo, it must be P Dank
Oh you like my music, girl? Gee, thanks
Go buy my CD, kids, ‘cause I need bank
And I've always loved rap and I've had a knack for it
Since back before I could slap a backboard
Ten years later, let life fast forward
Now I'm making those tracks that the people ask for

[Hook: Spose]
All I do is rhyme, smoke my weed
And spend my time
Trying to get better than me
And I'd be fine
If I never made it, but I did
So I'll take credit ‘cause I changed my life
Now I'm doing alright
