(Cam Groves)
I was born in the burbs, still absurd
Verse typed like a nerd, Microsoft Word
Got that fresh shit, kind of like a soft turd
I'm piss drunk, flipping of an officer
As soon as the blue's flipping, I'm tripping like cough syrup
So I keep my back straight like good posture
Even though I'm high, eyes redder than lobsters
Girls going down under like they're drinking Fosters
Ask me why I did it, I tell you "I'm not sure"
I'm just an impostor with highly distraught nerves
Higher than a motherfucking flying saucer
And I roll deep cheap, you can peep my roster
The only time I ever used a gun I shot birds
And I guess growing up in the hood is a lot worse
Not stopping me from dropping a hot verse
Cam can't dance still, you got served

(Chorus)
I try to keep it all in perspective
And right now collecting respect is my objective
When life gets hectic, just take a walk around
And remember that there's no one there to knock you down
You can find me backroading, whipping like I'm Catwoman
With the crispest system, got the speakers in the back booming
I never act stupid even though I dumb it out
No matter what you do, someone's going to run their mouth

(Spose)
Man, I come from the land of the ice and snow
We got frigid long Decembers with salted roads
We might relax on a blunt, and take it nice and slow
Because any minute now life could go up in smoke
Those who heard him spit say "Aww Christ, he's dope"
Yet he's only got trees when the price is low
So disassemble your brakes, twice that broke
Man, I'm neutrons short of an isotope
I'm the type of motherfucker who might spike his own coke
In yesterday's tee-shirt yelling tomorrow blows
Because they'll still be like, "Who the fuck is Spose?"
Except white trash rolling with recycled hope
You know I'm not just another fake griping oaf
Just hoping he can avoid going from tight to a joke
With single digit temperatures and frost-bit toes
I'm could ripple Poland Spring, I've got the nicest flow

(chorus)

(Cam Groves)
I got the rhymes that'll makes the fans listen
All Cam's missing in Spose's ambition
I wrote stand still because I couldn't stand sitting
Devised the plan mission, made the transition
Can't take the heat? Get out of the damn kitchen
Because you haters grind my gears like a jammed transmission
Damn, Cam's wishing for a cut like a Band-Aid
Because I got a fan base the size of an ant's face
Smoking on that landscape, looking for a good word
Just another white rapper crawling out the wood work
You think I would learn the trouble that I'm facing
But I could give two fucks, like double penetration
Look my pen is racing, listening to music
Watching TV while it's muted. Who's this?
Cam Groves, I'm the new kid, keep it true
From my blue fitted to where my shoes is
