[Verse 1]
Look, I think they set us up to let us down
Cause I don't quite know what to do, where to go, who I am, where I am right now
Thought I would be on top, with a pool and a yacht by 29
23, she's pregnant, I'm unemployed, we gon' be fine
Or so I hope, will I choke, will I stay afloat
Record label, no, let me go, got me losing hope
I left college with no degree, oh woe is me
This debt addressed to boulevard of broken dreams
When I'm 30 I'll be sold out at the stadium
House big as palladium, you can let Tom Brady in
These naked girls Canadian, this private jet my favorite
To wave at aliens, that's what I thought when I was 20
I had plenty bumps and bruises
Wrong turns, wins and loses
Reality was gruesome when it grew from the illusion
Feel like I was headed somewhere don't remember where it was
Somebody yelled, "Join the club!"

[Chorus]
We all got lost
We all got lost
We all got lost (I don't know where to go)
We all got

[Verse 2]
I fell off the written map
I went both directions at the fork and I got split in half
I made the mistake of tryna have my cake and eat it (eat it)
Keep it and delete it
Party all the time and somehow still succeed at my achievements
This for every bartender with a bachelor degree
If you have to craft amendments on the map to the peak
For every former emcee who used to rap to the beat
And had to sell his microphone cause life isn't cheap
For every girl who became a mom, whoops, on accident
Wasn't even tryna have a kid, you were just practicing
For every musician that should have made it, never did
And traded in their dreams but got this job with benefits
And went to school and got the job, but never got happy
What the fuck is going on?
We followed the instructions and arrived at the mirage
Thought everything went wrong
Then I turned on my flashlight in the fog

[Chorus]
We all got lost
The summer turned frost
Somewhere on our way to the top
We all got lost
And we might never get back
Searchin' for things we already have
We all got lost (now I don't know where to go)
We all got lost
Can you show me the way?
Show me the way

[Bridge]
I thought I would be rich by now
I thought I would have it figured out
I thought I would be rich by now
I thought I would have it figured out

[Verse 3]
He was gonna go pro, scholarship full of dough
He could not fail
But he got caught with the dro, in Alabama with a o
And he got expelled
So now he's in his hometown, ow, back on unemployment
Saw his high school coach, oh, felt like disapointment
He got lost, rolled backwoods and he light it up
He thought he'd be playing D2 like the Mighty Ducks
She's an actress, sleeping on a mattress
Moved out to Hollywood, mom it's gonna happen
She went to audition, rejection, audition, depression and ibuprofen
Questioning everything, sobbing watching the Oscars
Man, I know by now she figured she would make it
10 years later she's a damn good waitress
So I tipped her good, said it's lonely at the top
She said she was lonely I said, "No you're not"

[Chorus]
We all got lost
The summer turned frost
Somewhere on our way to the top
We all got lost
And we might never get back
Searchin' for things we already have
We all got lost
Now I don't know where to go
We all got lost
Can you show me the way?
Show me the way
We all got lost

[Outro]
We all got lost
The summer turned frost
Somewhere on our way to the top
(I thought I would be rich by now)
We all got lost
And we might never get back
Searchin' for things we already have
(I thought I would have it figured out)
We all got lost
Now I don't know where to go
(I thought I would be rich by now)
We all got lost
Can you show me the way?
Show me the way
(I thought I would have it figured out)
We all got lost
