[Chorus]
Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic
Though I'm a proponent though
Though I'm a proponent though
Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic
Wells, Maine, "be-be-be smart, don't be a retard"

[Verse 1: Spose]
Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic
I propose doing both with discretion I've learned lessons
Chilling watching Conan alone in the zone, homie
Find me lit like fluorescence, no questioning burn sessions
You want to converse yet my words nonsensical
And my vision blurred reputation reprehensible
Find me with some beasters at five Eastern, four Central
If the end is near, dutch beer in my tentacles
Let's say we skip Wife Swap, girl, find a bright spot
In this dark world, drive around, flip off the bike cops
When I'm dead I might stop, or maybe when mice talk
(Reversed: or maybe when mice talk), microwave the rice sock

[Chorus]
Though I'm a proponent though
Though I'm a proponent though
Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic
Wells, Maine, "be-be-be smart, don't be a retard"

Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic
I propose doing both with discretion I've learned lessons
Homie I ain't thuggin', just pluggin' the microphone in
And showin' you I been fresh with pencils since adolescence
My punctuation period, on point properly
Real name: Cameron, spelt with no apostrophes
On top of beats stopping me is obsolete
I'm either dropping frees or just jotting my philosophies
Hi, my name is Cam Groves, I've been on the mic since
Fifteen, big dreams, no driver's license
No matter what life gives, whether it be wife, kids
I'll be on the mic holding tight like some vice grips

[Chorus]
Though I'm a proponent though
Though I'm a proponent though
Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic
Wells, Maine, "be-be-be smart don't be a retard"
