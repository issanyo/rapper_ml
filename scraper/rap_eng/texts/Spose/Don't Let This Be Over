[Hook]
Don't let this be over
Cause I'm feeling alright
Mary just rolled up
So let's all get high tonight

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
Before I made a nickle off telling your dad
I had the swagger of a cripple
I was flippin' burgers, putting chowder on the burner
In a town you've never heard of
And when I got to leave I was driving with my knees
Seat belt unfastened
Hands out the moon-roof, feeling fantastic
Pigs eat donuts, I drive past 'em
And pull into the party with the R. Kelly blastin'
("My mind's telling me no!")
Size thirty Bullhead saggin'
And as I walk I check my pockets for my wallet and my baggy
Both things present, assholes absent
Homestead packed, Full House, Bob Saget
Peeps in the backyard, campfire comforting
Cause Cameron and company encompass the circumference
This feels amazin', I'm blazin'
I'm drinkin', I'm thinkin' that

[Pre-hook]
We should get the Backwoods rolled, blow it in the sky
Hide it by my side if the cops drive by
If they do show up, I'ma look 'em in the eye all high and say

[Hook]
Don't let this be over
Cause I'm feeling alright
Mary just rolled up
So let's all get high tonight

[Verse 2]
It was all a dream
My backpack was L.L.Bean
I didn't think rap would mean tremendous cream
But then I wrote a song with no guns or pimpin'
And I got away with a hit, O.J. Simpson
Paid for my rhymes, now I can cop an Acura
Cause everything I've written isn't bitten like it's Dracula
It's accurate, and I don't wanna fall like Niagara
So I'm going harder than some grandpas on Viagra
Leisure isn't my procedure, neither is the Visa
And my ego's never dieseled though I'm evil at the easel
And I'm equal to my peoples
Though I'm loco with my vocals
And I'm breaking up the dojo like Yoko broke up The Beatles
Somebody pinch me, this can't be life
I spark the weed like it's candlelight
My life's like a virgin, Goddamn it's tight
I'm alright for the night, so

[Pre-hook]
We should get the Backwoods rolled, blow it in the sky
Hide it by my side if the cops drive by
If they do show up, I'ma look 'em in the eye all high and say

[Hook]
Don't let this be over
Cause I'm feeling alright
Mary just rolled up
So let's all get high tonight

[Verse 3]
Man, who could have predicted what happened to this kid?
They said he was an outcast (outcast), a misfit
Square like a mousepad, working in the kitchen
Listening to J5, while he did dishes
I used to get mocked, then I made CDs
Now they all gawk when I spill it, like BP
Used to be invisible, now they can't see me
Came in the game, like jizzing in the Oiuja
Even though I'm slept-on, I don't wanna wake up
Back to my wallet that was flatter than an A-cup
Let's say fuck the peeps who won't change the place up
They suck


[Hook]
Don't let this be over
Cause I'm feeling alright
Mary just rolled up
So let's all get high tonight
