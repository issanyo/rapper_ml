[Verse 1]
Ain't shit changed, still bony, no bowflex
Googling some titties when my girl won't give me throat sex
(Swag) Stressing, strung out, kotex
Wishing I could get my money back from them old checks
American, proletariat, derelict
No inheritance, heiresses think my lair is embarrassing
I'm the stoner Spider-Man, ripping chemical vitamins
Spit it, general cypherin', gripping emerald Heinekens
I sold LP's, smoked lb's
You smell me? That's Wells Beach
I'm on my soil, chilling on a winter's night
I ran out of oil, that's that shit I don't like
Came in the game with a brain, not an amulet
I need the cannabis, not what is on the mannequin
I procreated so you know I need the money
Must've saw me looking scrawny and they thought he wasn't hungry

[Chorus]
I'm starving, I'm starving
Shit I'll eat all the food in your apartment
I'm starving, I'm starving
I might even eat the shit up out the garbage
I'm starving, I'm starving
I'll eat the whole turkey you ain't gotta carve it
I'm starving, I'm starving
I'll eat the walls and the ceiling and the carpet

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's that ugly white rapper, no, not Paul Wall
But the one from the North, doesn't say "all y'all"
I got a ten sack, that's like eight more balls
And I'm gonna blow trees till the acorns fall, ayup
It's like I'm riding in a beamer
When I'm in a Nissan with Ryan Peters on the speakers, ayup
Same shit, people that I came with
Still up in Maine, bitch, I ain't that famous
And this isn't commercial
But it would be if I hadn't been dropped from Universal
They say you gotta pay to fly
You want filets on a plane, well them stakes is high
So I'm sitting at McDonald's, I don't got a dollar
I might spit in it and then sip the saliva out the bottle
I procreated so you know I need the money
Must've saw me looking scrawny and they thought he wasn't hungry

[Chorus]
I'm starving, I'm starving
Shit I'll eat all the food in your apartment
I'm starving, I'm starving
I might even eat the shit up out the garbage
I'm starving, I'm starving
I'll eat the whole turkey you ain't gotta carve it
I'm starving, I'm starving
I'll eat the walls and the ceiling and the carpet
(Skinny women lose weight like)
(Bring it)

[Verse 3]
This is East of Eden mixed with Reasonable Doubt
Made an album for the label but they never put it out
Paid my dues now I'm waiting on a couch
Made enough off rap for down payments on a house, ayup
Come hither, the blunt and drum hitter
The humble humdinger, the mumbling gunslinger, ayup
Truck beds, middle class, bud hev
Nickelback, little cash, enough said, cripple swag
(Spizzy) Back like a tramp stamp locale
Made a hundred grand in a month but I'm broke now
(Spizzy) Luckily, that's what my steez is
Genius, covered in the crumbs from the Cheez-Its
I got the fame minimal, nickname pivotal
Whip game miserable, rib cage visible
I procreated, man, you know I need the money
Must've saw me looking scrawny and they thought he wasn't hungry

[Chorus]
I'm starving, I'm starving
Shit I'll eat all the food in your apartment
I'm starving, I'm starving
I might even eat the shit up out the garbage
I'm starving, I'm starving
I'll eat the whole turkey you ain't gotta carve it
I'm starving, I'm starving
I'll eat the walls and the ceiling and the carpet
(Skinny women lose weight like)
(We really need food)
