[Intro: Spose]
OK, Spose, and Girlicious

[Hook: Natalie, all three]
In the next three minutes, if I don't get a drink
You ain't seeing pink, you ain't seeing pink
In the next two minutes, if I don't get a sip
You ain't getting shit, you ain't getting shit
In the next minute, if I don't get a shot
We ain't getting hot, we ain't getting hot
In the next five secs, if I don't get a glass
You ain't getting ass, boy, don't even ask

[Verse 1: Nichole & Spose]
I see these boys, and uh, they always think (Uh...)
"If I can hit it, I'd be the dopest" (Such a fucking tease)
I look like sex (Uh-huh), with no regret (Yup)
So Mr. Arie, go get me something

[Pre-Hook: Chrystina, Natalie & Spose]
You won't get a chance 'less you spend it
Tell the bartender, have him send it (I'll be right back)
La, la, la, la, I'm still here waiting
Blah, blah, blah, blah, you just keep stuttering (But, but, but)

[Hook: Natalie, all three]
In the next three minutes, if I don't get a drink
You ain't seeing pink, you ain't seeing pink
In the next two minutes, if I don't get a sip
You ain't getting shit, you ain't getting shit
In the next minute, if I don't get a shot
We ain't getting hot, we ain't getting hot
In the next five secs, if I don't get a glass
You ain't getting ass, boy, don't even ask

[Verse 2: Chrystina & Spose]
Like, "Oh my gosh," I think he looks lost (Look at that)
You pay the cost or I ain't going near that box (Not in yo' box)
Until the taxi, until I'm tipsy
If you can't please me, then I'll be saying "next," peace

[Pre-Hook: Nichole, Natalie & Spose]
Jump on it, time is tickin'
If you don't come quick, I'll be bouncin' (Wait, um...)
La, la, la, la, I'm still here waitin' (What was your name again?)
Blah, blah, blah, blah, last call is coming

[Hook: Natalie, all three]
In the next three minutes, if I don't get a drink
You ain't seeing pink, you ain't seeing pink
In the next two minutes, if I don't get a sip
You ain't getting shit, you ain't getting shit
In the next minute, if I don't get a shot
We ain't getting hot, we ain't getting hot
In the next five secs, if I don't get a glass
You ain't getting ass, boy, don't even ask

[Verse 3: Spose]
Girl, I said I'm sorry, really, honestly, I tried
You've no idea how hard it is to get a drink when you're 5'5
In line, behind a guido and a yuppie
And a tool and a douche and a skater and a junkie
Wish I was a little bit taller
Be quicker when I'd tried to get your liquor for some dollars
And I know you wanted Redbull vodka
Had my credit card, but I lost it
Then my other one got declined
But I stole you this Bud Light lime, girl
Armpits sweaty, stench of a yeti
See this other brother got you drinks already
But lady, maybe we could still get down
Let me hit it in the whip like I was Chris Brown

[Bridge: Chrystina]
You wanna holla, so spend that dollar
Give me some alcohol, oh, yeah
I'm so impatient, boy, I ain't playing
No

[Interlude: Natalie & Spose]
Hey, what's up, girl?
Patron, yo no se porque no tengo un bebida en mi mano
No, I don't speak Spanish
Yo no se, diga me porque
That's hot, I just have no idea what you're saying

[Hook: Natalie, all three]
In the next three minutes, if I don't get a drink
You ain't seeing pink, you ain't seeing pink
In the next two minutes, if I don't get a sip
You ain't getting shit, you ain't getting shit
In the next minute, if I don't get a shot
We ain't getting hot, we ain't getting hot
In the next five secs, if I don't get a glass
You ain't getting ass, boy, don't even ask

[Outro: Spose, other guy]
What the? Where is our drink?
I don't know, Nic
I don't know girls, I have no clue
What is taking so long?
So bullshit, Nat
I wanna drink
He was cute...
Wait, wait is that...
Yo, who is this guy?!
Ay, yo, yo, yo, shawty, here's your drink
Finally!
Finally you bring the...
You took forever, you idiot!
Dude, where did you come from, I've been here...
Oh! My God!
Oops...
Oh my God, all over my shoes
He spilt it
Are you serious?
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I said I'm fucking sorry, chill out
We need to leave right now, valet!
Valet immediately
Oh my God, who do they think they are? That's ridiculous
