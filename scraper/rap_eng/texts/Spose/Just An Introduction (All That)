[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh
This is all that
This is all that
Oh, oh, oh
This is all that
This is all that

[Verse 1]
Uh, yo, yo, yo
Now this is just an introduction before I blow your mind
The MILFs call me Spose, rhymes tight as a va-gine
Been rapin' mics, no homo, all the time
Photo up in Vibe, bags under my eyes
I let the rap game think that I'm the goofiest
And then I take advantage of it, like I fucking roofied it
Big in the limelight, soaking up the juiciness
Trying to string together a couple hits, Kevin Youkilis
I'm where the neck beard and the stubble's at
Stumble in the spot and get it poppin' like it's bubble wrap
Never rhyme watered down, this is life in Wells
Sold records out of trunks, smokin' on that Michael Phelps
'Cause everything I do is (all of that!)
Don't even bother, lady, I won't (call back!)
The haters, they can chew on my (ballsack!)
Go get some pills, 'cause I'm really that ill, and I'm

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh
This is all that
This is all that
Oh, oh, oh
This is all that
This is all that

[Verse 2]
And that's why my vocal chords soar, kinda like a blimp
Rhyme style: jacked, body type: shrimp
"You should give in!" No can do
I'm duckin' from the sharks 'til my pockets are Shamu
And I'm having a whale of a time
I'm on stage hammered, still nailing a rhyme
And they think I'm a tool, un-bejeweled fingers
I'm not to be fooled, well-read like a ginger
I live life simpler, I'm trying to make tracks
In between puffin' green and taking out the trash
And ever since my presumptuous teens
Presuming I could tackle my voluptuous dreams
And now I'm tickled pink, clicking porn links
Porky Pigs pull me over after four or more drinks (whoop whoop)
But they know the deal, like a drug bust
Never thugged up, but I flow tight, lug nuts

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh (Kesha ran 'em over)
This is all that (Kesha ran 'em over)
This is all that (get 'em, grandma)
Oh, oh, oh (uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
This is all that
This is all that

[Verse 3]
And I'm the modest-est in Maine
Beer bottle in the tank
Had nada in the bank
Still preposterously dank
Not a coke-seller
But I rap stellar, broke feller
Smoke-smeller, joke-teller
The award show podium-lover
Say hello to your mother
Spizzy Spose roll through weed hairs Nickelodeon-colored
Got the props and the pounds
And the daps and the plaques
I rap like you would if you weren't wack
Got 'em stacked to the shingles
Chickens wanna mingle
All the single ladies eat my babies like a dingo
I'm sorry, but I'm far out, Oslo
Groves drunk, chillin' with a heifer like Rocko
I'm
I'm drunk

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh (get 'em)
This is all that
This is all that (get it)
Oh, oh, oh (uh, bring it back)
This is all that
This is all that (Spizzy Spose in the motherfuckin' house)
Oh, oh, oh
This is all that
This is all that (get 'em)
Oh, oh, oh (uh huh, bring it back)
This is all that
This is all that
