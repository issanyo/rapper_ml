[Verse 1: Cam Groves]
I hack away, smoke a pack a day
I know that I'm dying at a faster rate
And my addiction's hit me in a nasty way
Like I need to watch porn while I masturbate
Pass the cake, a Big Mac, large fry, two four-piece nuggets, and a fuckin' massive shake
I eat it all faster than a fat kid's plate
Then I'll need to take a nap on this plastic tray
Hey, I got a massive addiction for backwoods and piff in addition to Pabst that I'm sipping
I got 'em stacked in the kitchen, and hey, if you got yay, never pass on the sniffing
I wake up in the morning to some caffeine, I go to bed at night having bad dreams
In between, do what makes me happy, and fool around with Abby, nude up in my backseat

[Chorus: Cam Groves]
I'm addicted, ever since I tried it
I'm addicted, and now I'm relying
I'm addicted, man I ain't gon' lie
Not a night goes by where I'm not getting high
I'm addicted, since I tried the shit
I'm addicted, man I tried to quit
I'm addicted, I think I'm groping for life
How something so wrong make me feel so right?

[Verse 2: Spose]
I'm not kidding, I'm addicted, distracted by my perversions
I've been searching Rachel Starr since before they called it twerking
Probably jerking looking at it if the internet is working
If I don't I get withdrawals like my bank when weed is purchased
If I don't get some coffee then I'm fearing for you
Cause I'll be complaining in my brain and I'm irritable
When they see me at the drive-thru, they fill up a large cup
Whether or at Aroma Joe's, Dunkin or a Starbucks
Spar up, leading off of various traits
Even though I shouldn't [?] to budgetary constraints
If I had fat cash from the blunts I've been buying I'd have enough to buy lunch for the country of China
I make concerning decisions, can't [?]
Caffeinated, masturbating, burning, yearning and itching
And I'm not proud cause I can't stop, it may be embarrassing
But it could be worse, I could be into raping and heroin

[Chorus: Cam Groves]
I'm addicted, ever since I tried it
I'm addicted, and now I'm relying
I'm addicted, man I ain't gon' lie
Not a night goes by where I'm not getting high
I'm addicted since I tried the shit
I'm addicted, man I tried to quit
I'm addicted, I think I'm groping for life
How something so wrong make me feel so right?
