[Sample of Hall & Oates' "Grounds for Separation]
Tin can sound and a dead-eyed crowd
Can turn a sane man crazy and a crazy man sad
I can fight with the best, but I can only go so many rounds

[Spose]
You know me
I get down I live now cause it's the S-P-O-S-E, S-E
You know we, we get down we live now and when we do we rep the Wells, M-E, M-E

[Verse 1]
Papa don't preach, momma, I'm so sorry
I don't get paid 'till the end of next week
Laugh, but it's not funny
Being broke, it makes you wanna grab a ski mask
And not for bunny slopes
Nope, I'm done being a crook, and thank heavens
I'm filing Chapter 11, haven't started the book
Man, look, I earn it, I cash it, I burn it, I pack it again
I write it, I spit it, I make it for me and my friends

[Hook]
You know we, we get down we live now 'cause we're free
To do what we want and we rep the M-E
With Spose, no lies, flows and bowls
But we gotta keep 'em under control

You know we, we get down we live now 'cause we're free
To do what we want and we rep the M-E
With Spose, no lies, flows and bowls
But we gotta keep 'em under control

[Verse 2]
And though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic
I propose doing both with discretion, I've learned lessons
It's unimpressive but my checks bounce like asses
Blunt ashes all over the sofa and the mattress
If going ape is reverse-evolution
And balls-to-the-wall sounds sexually abusive
Me? I got a hankering for both
I can't seem to keep my anchor in the cove
On the low, my pops said that my money need management
More canned store-brand Spam, bologna sandwiches
Somebody said "Go big or go home"
I lost my house key, put Frank White on
It's not a dinner in the summer or the winter when we clam bake
Ignore laws and mandates
Ignite fires in sand dunes
Me and lampoons
Whip opposite of Lambo, freestyle with Cam Groves

[Hook]
You know we, we get down we live now 'cause we're free
To do what we want and we rep the M-E
With Spose, no lies, flows and bowls
But we gotta keep 'em under control

You know we, we get down we live now 'cause we're free
To do what we want and we rep the M-E
With Spose, no lies, flows and bowls
But we gotta keep 'em under control

You know we, we get down we live now 'cause we're free
To do what we want and we rep the M-E
With Spose, no lies, flows and bowls
But we gotta keep 'em under control
You know we, we get down we live now 'cause we're free
To do what we want and we rep the M-E
With Spose, no lies, flows and bowls
But we gotta keep 'em under control

[Outro]
You know me
Wells, Maine
