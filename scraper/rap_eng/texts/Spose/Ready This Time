[Verse 1: Spose]
I lost my first record deal in ten months, blinded by the light from
Let's run to redrum, now I see it twenty twenty
Like Dateline, you can't rush in like Putin
'cause that's stupid, all good things take time
See, if I signed a deal, I'd do it a little different this time
I'd make sure my album dropped like the day it got signed
So I could make it first, with no interference
Or no clearance from a label pyramid equipped with paperwork
So no pop-rap radio hit clickbait, just what I dictate
I could tell the label boss, "Hey bro, how my dick taste?"
Instead, I moved at a quick pace
I should have held out for two mill in new bills
With the big face, think about that to this day, bro I...

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Learned so much, got burned so much
But I made it through the fire, 'bout to turn me up
'cause I'm ready this time (are you ready?)
I said I'm ready this time
I said I learned so much, got burned so much
They put me on mute, 'bout to turn me up
'cause I'm ready this time (are you ready?)
I said I'm ready this time

[Verse 2: Spose]
Everyone who ever wrote me off can blow me
Ryan never lyin', genuine like "Pony"
Tryna touch cheese like pepperoni
I'ma make sure they know me, mom, going out swinging like Kobe
One time I filmed a pilot for MTV
And when we wrapped it up, like no STD
The producer of the show phone called me
He's like, "Uh, bro, yo, they didn't pick up the show, I gotta go"
Never heard from him again, not a word from him again
What is shiny on the surface isn't perfect in the end
Man I've been rejected bill collected, left for dead then resurrected
Truly feelin' triumphed down from this perspective, my confession:

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Learned so much, got burned so much
But I made it through the fire, 'bout to turn me up
'cause I'm ready this time (are you ready?)
I said I'm ready this time
I said I learned so much, got burned so much
They put me on mute, 'bout to turn me up
'cause I'm ready this time (are you ready?)
I said I'm ready this time

[Verse 3: Spose]
My publishing company been tryin' to fuck me
Like they filled the tub bubbly, put the jets on, put the Keith Sweat on
Lit a couple candles and invited me in
Relationship abusive since the day that it begin
They took me out to lunch just to butter me up
To get me on board and throw me under the bus
They said they can't believe I wrote plus produced it plus I'm rappin'
What a talent, here's a hundred thousand, get ready for Jimmy Fallon (Jimmy!)
I should've been wary, it was Sony told me Katy Perry
Is the type of artist they could pair me with
But that never happened, if I had this shit to do again
Nobody's getting a dollar off what I do with the pen

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Learned so much, got burned so much
But I made it through the fire, 'bout to turn me up
'cause I'm ready this time (are you ready?)
I said I'm ready this time
I said I learned so much, got burned so much
They put me on mute, 'bout to turn me up
'cause I'm ready this time (are you ready?)
I said I'm ready this time
