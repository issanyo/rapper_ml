[Hook: B. Aull]
Yeah
Last time
I said this would be the last time
It's past nine
You got me speeding through the night
I'm just tryna get to you
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you-u
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you-u-u
Last time
You said this would be the last time
It's past nine
You don't wanna be with me tonight
You won't let me get to you
Let me get to you
Let me get to you-u
Let me get to you
Let me get to you
Let me get to you-u-u

[Verse 1: Spose]
I said I'm done with you, I quit
Then I start drinking, I think I'm addicted
I pull up, pick you up quick
And you were smelling like "I'm doing well tonight"
Then it's game over, Lil Flip
We did it right as this record was written
I hit it even though you were forbidden
'Cause I had a girlfriend the first time we did it
In the Honda, Honda
Had me hooked like piranha, I'ma
Keep it secret like Wakanda, T'Challa
Never hesitate, no comma, I know
You and me been breaking up since we met
But we still ain't broken up yet
And through the night I'm racin'
It's a sticky situation

[Hook: B. Aull]
Last time
I said this would be the last time
It's past nine
You got me speeding through the night
I'm just tryna get to you
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you-u
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you-u-u
Last time
You said this would be the last time
It's past nine
You don't wanna be with me tonight
You won't let me get to you
Let me get to you
Let me get to you-u
Let me get to you
Let me get to you
Let me get to you-u-u

[Verse 2: Spose]
Look
I thought I could quit you, I can't
Addicted to you I am
Oops, I just did it again, Britney
You got me into cocaine, Whitney
You said I'm using you
I said that's true but I just can't give you the boot
You are the muse to my musical
Wish I eluded you
You made me anxious as usual
When I saw you at camp in a Subaru
Then we broke up it's a funeral
But your residue will reside in my cuticles
You're the best of the best like a supergroup
And I swore you off, you cost too much
You stress me out, you're stress relief
Wait, how you both? That makes no sense
And when you come you're quick to leave
You taste so good I swear I flew flew flew flew flew flew
Put you in the woods, pass you off to my crew crew crew crew crew crew

[Hook: B. Aull]
Last time
I said this would be the last time
It's past nine
You got me speeding through the night
I'm just tryna get to you
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you-u
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you-u-u
Last time
You said this would be the last time
It's past nine
You don't wanna be with me tonight
You won't let me get to you
Let me get to you
Let me get to you-u
Let me get to you
Let me get to you
Let me get to you-u-u

[Verse 3: Spose]
You're my longest relationship
I know I shouldn't do you but I can't resist
Got me arrested I hate this shit
But then I fall for you when I get a taste of it
It's not new to me so I zoom and speed
'Cause you and me could be a jubilee
You got me ordering charcuterie
And listening to weird shit like Human League
To get to you after 1
Text more digits than the root of 3
I go where you are, I need you
You my master like 2 degrees
I'll find you (find you)
I thought I was in charge like Ty Lue (Ty Lue)
But I'm not in control and you're like Janet, Janet
That's why we did it
Now I'm in the kitchen, I fish for a sandwich, sandwich
I'm not even famished, damn it
Burrito and I am not Spanish
Manic, stressing, freaking out
Once I put you in my mouth
I just smoked you on a couch
You got me floating in the clouds

[Hook: B. Aull]
Last time
I said this would be the last time

Tryna get to you

Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you
Tryna get to you-u-u
Last time

You don't wanna be with me tonight
You won't let me get to you
