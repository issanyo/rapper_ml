[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Hey, let's go down the rabbit hole
They don’t supervise me no more
Down, d-down, down, d-down we go
When it stop? Baby, I don't know

[Verse 1: Spose]
Ooh, I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice, maybe one thousand
Open that cabinet, give me that tablet
We could make magic
What is this fabric? Velveteen Rabbit
It’s a bad habit, we gon' be addicts
We gon' keep at it, we could see you want it
We could reach out there and grab it, strung out like a racket
I couldn't imagine (back then)
You would ever let this (happen)
How'd the good time turn into a (bad time)
Guess the fog rolls in when you're on (cloud nine)
You are too high on Wonderland
You never made it out again
You're with Michael, David, Milo and Ed
And Aunt Mary, Donna, Monica, Alison
Lucy, Sandra, Diane
Laser shootin' diamonds
Can’t believe that our recreation
Became your expiration
But the band plays on when you’re dead
I wish you hadn't listened to me when I said

[Chorus: Dave Gutter & Spose]
Hey, let’s go down the rabbit hole
They don't supervise me no more
Down, d-down, down, d-down we go
When it stop? Baby, I don't know
Ooh, I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice, maybe one thousand

[Verse 2: Spose]
We would text people who got smoke
You look like you’re on a diet, coke
I was there when we tried it though
Hold on, let's see how high this goes
Brush up [?]
Turn that shit up and give me some mo'
Who bust a rhyme and give me some mo'
Let's chase the cat down the corridor
Always thought you would make it out
I hope you're rockin' out right now
Down, d-down, d-down, down, we go
Deeper into the rabbit hole
We stayed up 'til like three or fo'
We was just seventeen years old
Ooh, I feel it, the overload
Why Yvette look bulimic though?
'cause she did it (back then)
I never thought this would (happen)
Good time turn into a (bad time)
Don't jump off of (cloud nine)

[Chorus: Dave Gutter, Spose & J.Spin]
Hey, let's go down the rabbit hole
They don't supervise me no more
Down, d-down, down, d-down we go
When it stop? Baby, I don't know
Ooh, I've been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice, maybe one thousand
Grab my hand, grab my hand, I'll pull you out
No, n-no, n-no, no no no
No, n-no, n-no, no no no
No, n-no, n-no, no no no
No, n-no, n-no, no no no
Hey, let's go down the rabbit hole
They don't supervise me no more
Down, d-down, down, d-down we go
When it stop? Baby, I don't know
Cloud nine
