Yo, I woke your man up, broke your band up
I'm the last act playin' at the dope-a-rama
Smoke and mirrors, coke and hammers
Little kids get raped
Here to Okla-bama
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
You know they got that shit locked away
They’ll give it to you, man, just not today
Pharmaceutical companies say you got to pay
So pull your pants up, do the rockaway
Don’t think about how it operates
Behind the scenes, behind the curtains
Catholic priest, anal sex with virgins
Who owns the government gets the permit
God’s online with a texting sermon
For Rex[?] and Herman and the Czechs and Germans
These are just diversions from the Texas earnings
Every time they make a bomb you know they’re getting paid (Bang bang!)
Let me sell you fear 'cause money’s made when you’re afraid
News cast flash with a mass of fascists
Smash glass bass[?] pass Damascus
Conquest bomb test cats distracted
By the wildin’ Mileys and their lack of asses
Pack a Backwoods sarin black as ashes
New styles futile back to rappin’
They own the earth with their gas and frackin'
And they’re laughin’ at us, Galafinakas
The deeper you dig, the more dirt you find
That’s why I don’t use a shovel here most of the time

[Hook] x4
Don’t pull your thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Syria
