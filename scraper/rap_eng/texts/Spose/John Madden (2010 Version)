Uh, okay
(Can you hear me?)
I can hear you, can you hear me?

[Verse 1: Spose]
I was sitting at my mom's dreaming about paychecks with loot
Your girlfriend's boobs, and how to smoke legal like Snoop (oops)
I'm interrupted by a door knock
It is 4:18, who the hell is this?
I get up quick, tuck my dick
I stop Drew from barkin' and get to Chris walkin'
It's a face that I've seen before
It's Mike George, we both graduated class of '04
I look deeper, he's got trees, maybe beasters
And in his fist, Backwoods and a Bic
That's that shit, Michael, are you joking or smoking?
He tells me that we've got two minutes to get it toking
420 on the digital, this is pivotal
'Cause I'm broke as fuck and I enjoy being a criminal
Right before this happened, I was sitting here rapping
Watching YouTube booty-clapping, PS2 action, playing

[Hook]
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
Switch it
Tony Hawk, Ton- Ton-Tony Hawk
Tony Hawk, Ton- Ton-Tony Hawk
Say no money money no money money money
(No money money no money money money)
I blazed and played John Madden when I got up
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
Uh
Ever since Big died, I've worshiped the dead
I write a verse in my head while I'm surfing the web
Every single breath, it is worth what I said
Keep sleeping on me, go purchase a bed
I'm fresh like new pants at a school dance
Keep it fly like a toucan, brew in hand
Is it true? Is it fake? Well, who's to say?
I thank Snoop and Dre for what I do today
It's the white rapper, Wells, Maine, walking on a rope
In the wintertime, snow blowing, not talking cold, nope
Put your hands up like I was a big deal
And wave 'em back and forth like wipers on windshields
I've been ill, the rap music would play
I was in fourth grade, my parents called it a phase
My high school years started jotting on pages
Then five years later I was rocking on stage, playing

[Hook]
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
Switch it
Tony Hawk, Ton- Ton-Tony Hawk
Tony Hawk, Ton- Ton-Tony Hawk
Say no money money no money money money
(No money money no money money money)
I blazed and played John Madden when I got up
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?

[Verse 3: Spose and Cam Groves]
[Cam Groves]
Coming straight outta Wells, skinny dude, bro named Cam Groves
Rototiller flow, I give a fuck about a damn ho

[Spose]
And he's not talking about some garden tools, pants low
Get it rolled before the show, chillin' at the transpo

[Cam Groves]
Been repping the M-E since peddling ten-speeds
And battling emcees when clubs were chem-free

[Spose]
We're talking Wendy's, high dudes, drive-thrus
Empty eight High Lifes then wake up to the NBA highlights

[Cam Groves]
Five mics, hold up the rhymes that I throw out
No doubt, make like paint and roll out

[Spose]
Spizzy Spose sold out locally, vocally
I can admit I'm the shit, aw, quick, get the potpourri

[Cam Groves]
I'm not a dope dealer, just a dope emcee
Well, I used to sell weed just to smoke for free

[Spose]
So-so open me a Michelob and openly I'll kick a flow
And hopefully somebody brought a blunt
'Cause we're chilling playing

[Hook]
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
