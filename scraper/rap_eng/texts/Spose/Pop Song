[Verse 1]
I started out underground
I was kinda like a seed
I had no manager, I booked my own shows
Made the posters and afterwards, I sold CD's
Then I made a song making fun of all the bragging
And it blew up in like, not long
Then I got signed to a deal, flew me out to LA
Put me in the studio and told me

[Chorus]
We want you to write a Pop song
We want you to write a Pop song
And make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
And do it for the kids!

[Verse 2]
â€˜Cause the kids want hits
They don't give a shit about the rhymes you spit
They just want a nice beat that they all could ride to
With a chorus catchier than swine flu times two!
I know you like Primo Beats
So you compose verses like they were a Keynote speech
But, we just want you to be 3OH!3
Mixed with Flo Rida mixed with B.o.B, capiche?
So make another "Airplanes"
Or a song like "Billionaire," either's fair game
Do it or go down in flames
Back to Maine, you can beg moose for spare change
You can't sing? We'll auto tune it!
Make it sound like someone else's music
We brought writers who could make it sound tighter
We could pull an all-nighter, baby

[Chorus]
We want you to write a Pop song
We want you to write a Pop song
And make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
And do it for the kids!

[Verse 3]
No, I wanna do it for Hip-Hop
You know, fresh to death, like a bird in a zip lock
They're like, "Spose, you're not fucking Rick Ross
We want something more like Ke$ha, tick tock"
I wrote a verse and said, "Listen to this shit"
They put their hands to their foreheads as I kicked it
They're like, "Look, I don't think that you get it
Nobody cares about your verse, it's not '96, kid!"
I told them, "Look man, I'd rather have my wrists slit
Than sound like every other fucking singer in the business"
They're like, "Really, Spose, would it be that cataclysmic
To make a couple songs for top 40 and rhythmic?
With hooks big enough to catch Moby Dick with?
With very few words and some melodies addictive?
If you're not up to the task, grab your bags
Call a cab, its too bad because"

[Chorus]
We want you to write a Pop song
We want you to write a Pop song
And make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
Make it sound like this
And do it for the kids!

[Outro]
We want you to write a Pop song
We want you to write a Pop song
And do it for the kids!
