[Ryan Augustus]
Keep an eye on the tempo
Let's get a groove going, guys

[Verse 1: Ryan Augustus]
Ready, set, lit to go
Liquid, twisted from Fisted flow
Bet you didn't know I was a misfit though
Bringin' summer heat to the cool, logistic snow
Oh yeah, I'll take it there
Make the Earth quake, just to shake the snare
For Christ sakes, I might make Mike [Flake stop porkin'?]
Make a cat come and get their drum brakes repaired
Sorry if the speed is surprisin'
It's like [?] like I'm always steady supplyin'
With so much flavor, no chance of denyin'
Two Ryans and a Shane, game better be risin'
From the attic to the basement, I'm an addict
When I'm facin' some flavor
In need of LASIK, clean placement

[Verse 2: Shane Reis]
It's the flow-flipper
Not a toe-dipper
Show up, no promo show-ripper
Inside your scope-gripper, see
Never ever have I had a mind for the gold-digger
Punch comb-roll with it
The pulsating, mold-breaking, breath-taking
Michael J. Foxin' head-bopping, neck-breaking
You follow, your legs shaking
You left hating, ventilating
Smelling my bread baking
Bred with the balls of a go-getter
Drums sound smoother than the malt liquor
Step up to the task like a stair shimmer
I'm that bear, better compared to you
Man, you look bare withered
Guarantee you, sir
If you ever leave your beats 'round me
Then I'm gon' baron her

[Verse 3: Spose]
Spose goes with the dopest of flows
Get the dough, hit the door
Ask Shane up in Maine, get more Pdank
'Cause the gang came changin' the game since yore
Whole crew been lame, so cold, Spring came
French bread, bring pain and herbal
My pants [?], old school since Shane's
My shit been Maine and rural
My whip is dirty rancid
The People's Douche and champion
Never lamped in the sand, couple grand in my hand
Gettin' tan with the fam in the Hamptons, ask Sampson
I got that penmanship, Aquemini
All over the lines, now the pigs wanna breathalize

[Verse 4: All]
[Ryan A:]
A fresh surprise, look what happens when a sesh arise
Nonetheless, some of the best comprised
[Shane]
Beware, we're comin' through, just be warned, it's up to you
Take this shit or leave it all steamin', we're not here to break even
[Spose]
Look, we want it more than you, we can't afford to lose
You sort of busters unaccustomed to the fortitude
