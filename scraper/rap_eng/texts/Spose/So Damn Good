[Intro: Cam Groves]
You smell good!
Damn, that smells good
I can smell it in my mouth

[Hook: Spose & Cam Groves]
You smell so damn good
I don't know if you knew
I'm saying you smell so damn good
Yeah, baby, it's true
I mean I smelled a lot of good shit in my day
But nothing quite like when you walk my way, so (No way)
I've been thinking you and me should meet
And maybe you could get up in my nose

[Verse 1: Cam Groves]
You smell like something I can taste
When you walked in the room, the draft punched me in the face
Like your perfume costed you a thousand an ounce
You smell like a French word I can't even pronounce
And it's a shame that I don't have much game
But I must say that you smell like it just rained (I'm just saying)
Girl, I could smell you for hours
Bet you smell like flowers even if you didn't shower
I walked up like, "What's happening? Hi"
Yo, that bath and body, got me acting naughty
Make me wanna start my own private after party
Then blow my nose just to make it half as snotty
That aroma got me buzzin'
You walk around town like your shit don't stank and it doesn't
You look as good as you smell, your style suitable
You got BO, but that "b" stands for "beautiful"

[Hook: Spose & Cam Groves]
You smell so damn good
I don't know if you knew
I'm saying you smell so damn good
Yeah, baby, it's true
I mean I smelled a lot of good shit in my day
But nothing quite like when you walk my way, so (No way)
I've been thinking you and me should meet
And maybe you could get up in my nose

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
Your like a blossom and I'm caught in it
You smell like the opposite of some rotten shit
And there ain't no stopping it from creeping up my nose holes
Make me wanna close do's and pose with no clothes
Every breath, I want you more and more
You're like a walkin', talkin' Sephora store
Got my nose tinglin', like I snorted cinnamon
As that odor lingers through the corridor
Damn, girl, you smell so amazing
I consider tasting the water that you're bathed in
The way you smell got me trying to sing
And if a smell had hands, I would buy it a ring
I get the taste of loving every time I inhale
With the mental picture of me tugging on your pigtails
I don't wanna sound like Pep√© Le Pew
But I'll take you home tonight and spend the next day with you

[Hook: Spose & Cam Groves]
You smell so damn good
I don't know if you knew
I'm saying you smell so damn good
Yeah, baby, it's true
I mean I smelled a lot of good shit in my day
But nothing quite like when you walk my way, so (No way)
I've been thinking you and me should meet
And maybe you could get up in my nose
