[Verse 1]
I'm a night owl, and a early bird
You need two stones, to get me to stop it
I'm used to, not sleeping
My pillow thinks that I'm cheating on it
Got mansions all on my checklist
No time to chill or watch Netflix
Me and Joey on a mission
I'll play every position
Plus I'm coaching, bro don't question my devotion
I'm approaching other levels so they hate again
I don't blink at little children, what's my age again?
I guess they thought that I was buried, 'cause my face was looking furry
Wasn't worried, I'm like Stephen Curry when he played for Davidson
I'm overworked and underrated, but I'm used to it
Everybody else sucks, shouldn't do music
Even when I'm joking, there's truth to it
I'm always working, so I
Keep my hands dirty, need to get in the hamper
I'm fine, but never satisfied, you know, can't get no
Driving automatic, but I'm setting the standard
I went from playing Sanford to San Francisco
Octane alert like amber
You can't see the trees through the forest
Don't you wish I had my horoscope?
Cancer
People don't try, people don't try
Whoops, now your chance gone by
Can you tell me why

[Hook: J Spin]
Why everything gotta be about you?
Now you ain't getting love, and you see how much we do
This something we getting used to, damn
Into nothing I wouldn't choose to
We bout to set our crew loose
[?]
Used to, damn
Into nothing I wouldn't choose to
Bout to set our crew loose
[?]

[Verse 2: Spose]
Ayup
Okay
The old shit our crew'll do is new to you
We heard "oh"s all around us like a hula hoop
Man, I feel like my medulla grew, the shit that I maneuvered through
I'm feeling like a supergroup (Spizzy)
When I first had my epiphany while whippin' my vehicular
I'll write blue collar symphonies, my people in particular
Detail it specifically, not lying like a senator
Got ice in my periphery, I'm cold, single integer
Man, my moves been enumerated, you been looking agitated
Gravitated to some people who could pay me
I made some albums, made some babies
You were lazy, sitting, bitching
I slid in like it was lubricated
So who's debating?
You don't work and you're a pussy like your neutered baby
I'm from Maine, my flow Hawaii, get the ukulele
And then what?
And tell me why

[Hook: J Spin]
Why everything gotta be about you?
Now you ain't getting love, and you see how much we do
This something we getting used to, damn
Into nothing I wouldn't choose to
We bout to set our crew loose
[?]
Used to, damn
Into nothing I wouldn't choose to
'Bout to set our crew loose
Ooh do noo

[Outro: J-Spin & Spose]
I woke up on my sofa, no there's no place like home
Told my mama I'm sober
Then I called Joe on the phone
I said we got no time to hang around, aye
The stupid check our bank accounts
*[?]*
Go 'head let it ride for a minute
God damn
Wells, Maine in this bitch
J Spin
Peter, Maine Gretsky
God.Damn.Chan
God.Damn.Chan's from like Standish, though
