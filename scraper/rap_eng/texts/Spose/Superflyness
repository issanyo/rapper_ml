Can't buy this, superflyness, superflyness, your Highness
Can't buy this, superflyness, superflyness, your Highness

[Verse 1: Shane Reis]
Let's go, I want you to feel this shit in your bones
The same way live that you feel it at your homes
So you could see it with yo' eyes and you would hear it through the phones
See through all the lies and bring to light what is known
When the 207 is on the line, I put it on
It's deeper than any song I've ever featured on, so
Feeling out of place? You mistaken, I belong here
What you on? I faced a lot of late nights and long years
Weaving in the tracks, like a dark chick with long hair
Fucked like a rabbit, fate would have it that I'm on snare
If I wasn't the underdog, it'd be beyond weird
Man, I'm used to the odds when they unfair
You see a kid in the attic, up on the lawn chair
Don't be alarmed, just be aware that there's a bomb there
Kaboom! I ask politely to make room
But I fit in the first time, I do what it takes to

[Verse 2: Spose]
I'm fly like found around trash bags
So rap cats get pounds like hashtags, save your pennies
There aren't many you can liken to him
Who spews beers when he spit and used to cypher with them
In two years, grew queer, Spizzy's frightenin' them
'Cause crews leer, too feared to Ryan, Michael and friends
I move peers who quitted to plug the mic in again
I move beers from fridges to the recyclin' bin
And I stupify guys, superfly rhymes, you could buy lines
But you couldn't tie my suicide tie
Guidelines to abide by or die, guy
You can ride pine, pride lines, millimeters from Peters
You skipped days like Ferris, staring at my merits
I feel like I don't even gotta say that's lame
Because I rose like Derrick, but no past is cherished
So I'm still tryna rise like Shane's last name, and you

[Verse 3: Shane Reis]
I fell down on my luck, bare with me
I'm just a country boy that's tryna make it in this city
See, I went from feeling flimsy in Buxton to sipping whiskey
To the people I look up to "what's up" and they fuckin' with me
And the people coming up to me, attempting to be company
A year ago, you wouldn't fuck with me and say "what's up" to me
Now you say "what's up" to me, I say "I'm living comfortably"
The meals looking nice from the sights of my supper, see
So eat up, but these uppity puppet he and shes
Who claiming on my flow ain't they cup of tea?
I bring that ruckus steez
And on a scale of one to ten, your ways fishy, your ways iffy
I'm just tryna pave the way like a gypsy
I went from easy to miss me with no name on the flyer
To being draped in all of this fresh P. Dank attire
Call me anything but ample time, I get busy
