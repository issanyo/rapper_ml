[Intro]
Ayup

[Verse 1]
'bout to go plat', got a big brain in my hat, locally famous for rap
Vocally snap, I'm never smokin' the dabs, grown too old for that crap
I look at my plaque, my reflection a snack, if I was gay, I would smash
Don't get attached, people with me yellin' "Spizzy!" when I walk in the mall
Bruisin' egos, human beatle, I'm like Lennon and Paul
Snipin' Whitney, hittin' Britney, how I started to ball
But how's this old, merry dad still better than y'all?
No necklace neck, but my state, I rep, got me out of debt
Got respect, Paypal or the check, don't look so perplexed
Dope since I was born, legendary unicorn
Rap money got me warm, might play Sweden, call up Bjorn
This is stackin' the cash, to Massachusetts and back

[Chorus]
This a brag track, ayy, ayy, ayy
You might think I got enough, but I think this is great
'cause when I put it on, all my problems went away
So I listen to it every day, I think I need another
Brag track, ayy, ayy, ayy
When I'm feelin' down, it could make me levitate
'cause when I put it on, all my problems went away
So I listen to it every day, I think I need another

[Verse 2]
All I know is sellin' rap songs by the seaside
I'm the only giant, size thirty on his Levis
King of the north, I feel like the white T.I
When I met my wife, I thought, "she could get the D-I..."
And I'm glad she didn't say no
When I'm on the mic, rip out your heart like I'm [?]
I've been underground, I'm from Maine, I'm potatoes
P. Dank Records is the motherfuckin' label
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I can do that for four bars because I'm paid
Off my songs I've made, nah, I wouldn't trade
Ain't no way, I need a parade, I go lemonade
I hit mics hard, then hit Dysart's
You don't try hard, I need five stars

[Chorus]
For my brag tracks, ayy, ayy, ayy
You might think I got enough, but I think this is great
'cause when I put it on, all my problems went away
So I listen to it every day, I think I need another
Brag track (braggin'), ayy, ayy, ayy
Even when I'm broke, I could make it precipitate (okay)
'cause when I put it on, all my troubles went away
So I listen to it every day, I think I need another
