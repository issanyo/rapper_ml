[Verse 1: Al-J]
Stay afloat in a triangle, won't sink in the Bermuda
Give a man an inch and now he think he's the ruler
Pick up on my instincts and staying sick with the future
Facebook and Twitter, most choose to link by computers
Show you're right, rest assured it was tight, I just ignore your type
Thirty cents short away from having a quarter, right?
In need of money but there's more to life
That meets the eye with more to sight
Do I have to spell it, kinfolk? Simple, it's elemental
The same goal that made the cats come build the temple
The verdict, dirt, ya heard it first, as I reveal the info
Star appeal, though it's all real on the tempo
Sometimes, the hell with givin', be self-fulfillin'
Prophecy, talk to me, what else could be the friction?
Deep, now and then, too intense to speak
My blueprint to reach, under the influence of the beat

[Hook: Sam Scott]
Oh, wicked ways, oh, saintly tones
Make this the day that peace will run
Oh, mercy me, how far we've gone
I crave the change the final piece will bring

[Verse 2: Spose]
I used to be looked down on, frowned on
Put my whole town on, now I'm like the pawn with the crown on
Rhyme opulent, bow when I'm walkin' in
If you listen close, you can hear the peasants talk again
Dreaming of my overthrow as I cash checks
They mutter, it's under their breath like necks
They poison what I'm drinkin' when I'm blinkin'
I let your ship take sail, pal, here quick, watch me sink it
With your trinkets, on the brink of clinkin' goblets full of mead
With you bros, just 'cause close how I keep my enemies
Cats put up fronts just to stab me in the back
Because my shit bumps, it's like acne on a track
You fraternize with wacker guys, you liars got me appetized
My rhythm and professionalism will smack 'em back in line
Single file, losers, group up with the goobers
Shit, I look cooler just sitting at the computer
I got what you've not found, kingdoms I have brought down
Gone too hard to opt out, came too far to stop now
Nikes dusty as I stand upon the ruins
Smoke everywhere, but I still shine through it
I'm a flower through the concrete, drive to make it decent
You tryin' to find my secrets, snoopin' like you're Long Beach
I'm rhymin' through the chorus, my momentum is tremendous
I'm mighty with the mic right at the end of my appendage
I never been pretentious even though I got attention
They're tense, I can't defend 'em or befriend 'em, I can end 'em

[Hook: Sam Scott]
Oh, wicked ways, oh, saintly tones
Make this the day that peace will run
Oh, mercy me, how far we've gone
I crave the change the final piece will bring
Oh, wicked ways, oh, saintly tones
Make this the day that peace will run
Oh, mercy me, how far we've gone
I crave the change the final piece will bring
