[Chorus: Dave Gutter & Anna Lombard]
Maybe I’ll never reach to that mountaintop
Maybe I’ll, maybe I’ll never reach to the mountaintop
But I’ll be damned if I don’t try

[Verse 1: Spose]
Dreams of the apex, the panorama I’m talking
Schemes from the paychecks, empty Montana my pockets
I had that big Nissan van
Envy at the baller’s money taller than Joel Embiid
But I can’t do shit with that, no
Jealousy never swole no fella salary bro
So I'm just inspired by seeing higher highs
I’ve seen lower lows
Not quite low as Lamar Odom go
But I’ve engaged in conversation with the dirt by the earth of the totem pole
The worst is over though
The demons in my mind I will overthrow
I know the world cold as North Dakota go
My streams big enough to row the boat
Till my chauffeur park the Lincoln like Mike Shinoda
Till I pop like soda in Minnesota
Till the minuses vanish
Till my height is risen
Till people flockin’ like Tyson’s pigeons
I’ll stop when I die or when I reach the mountaintop

[Chorus: Dave Gutter & Anna Lombard]
Maybe I’ll never reach to that mountaintop
Maybe I’ll, maybe I’ll never reach to the mountaintop
But I’ll be damned if I don’t try

[Verse 2: Spose & Cam Groves]
This a power ballad for sour Alex
Who glower from the town up at the tower palace, I feel you
This is for the peasantries with no pleasantries
Hope the future includes us in yachts upon the seven seas, let’s ride
Let’s climb fences up a craggy ledge
We’re climbing up a jagged edge to get to where the party at
Go grab your hardy hat
Bro, increase your cardiac
Till you collapse upon a crevasse with a heart attack
We were born into the game where the rules are not the rules
They’re trick instructions meant to keep the peasants from the jewels
The odds are stacked against the players like (lots of money)
Wouldn’t that piss you off?
Wouldn’t that make you wanna ascend to a distant fog
And kidnap the dog of the dicks who rigged this shit
And all their kids and all?
Sorry, I get carried away like, bodies
Cause making it from a trailer to wearing suits that are tailored is my only hobby
Besides watching the Celtics
I’ll drop or I’ll make it to the mountaintop

[Chorus: Dave Gutter & Anna Lombard]
Maybe I’ll never reach to that mountaintop
Maybe I’ll, maybe I’ll never reach to the mountaintop
But I’ll be damned if I don’t try
