[Verse 1: Anna Lombard, Dave Gutter, both]
Momma had a problem with
Poppa getting drunk while she stayed home
Poppa's s'posed to call the crib
I guess he didn't hit the payphone
So Momma packed all his shit
'Cause Poppa didn't come straight home
Poppa loves his ball and chain
Momma loves a rolling stone, at home
At home

[Hook: Armies]
Poppa loves his ball and chain
Momma loves a rolling stone, at home

[Verse 2: Anna Lombard, Dave Gutter, both]
God loves a working man
Poppa never went to church, though
And Momma was a perfect ten
And Poppa fell asleep in his work clothes
Poppa was a working man
But he drank as steady as his workload
But Poppa loves his ball and chain
And Momma loves a rolling stone, at home
At home

[Bridge: Dave Gutter & Anna Lombard]
Love don't fade (Love don't fade)
Love don't leave (Love don't leave)
Like Mom and Dad (Mom and Dad)
We'll grow a family tree (Grow a family tree)
[?]
We gonna play in the sea (Gonna play in the sea)
Like Mom and Dad (Mom and Dad)
We'll grow a family tree (Grow a family tree)
Woo!

[Verse 3: Spose]
Knock, knock! Open the door and then see all the people
Poppa was a rolling stone but when he started drinking, he felt like the Beatles
It felt like Ringo was playing, he sat at the bar to the beat
Grampa had cancer in liver, the apple not far from the tree
You know Momma ate dinner alone
He said he'd be home but his phone died
But he lost track of time, he's like, "Oh my"
She's like, "No you're not, dude, tell me, don't lie"
Poppa was a rolling stone, 1 AM and he won't go home
She glanced at the clock and then built a suitcase
With the pants and the socks, changing the locks
