[Intro]
And in conclusion
P. Dank

[Bridge]
I be that broke motherfucker, Maine's where I'm reppin'
Better than these rappers but nobody buys my record

[Verse 1]
What you don't like broke Hova?
You think that I'm more like a Hoover?
Think that I suck, I don't give a fuck
You can go ahead, hit me with a low blow like a tuba
I don't toot my horn but
I blew up quick like McGrubber
I didn't get a Lex like Luther
And I went hard till my cheeks looked fuscia
Used to want to beat King Koopa
Now all I want to beat is the beats
And the freak in the mirror, when the demon appears
I have seen my fears, I could be that loser
Even if it meant quitting reefer
Stop staying high like a roofer
So when you YouTube my manoeuvres
You can see my as a mover, rapper, producer
At the computer, ha!
With a Fender Strat and a pen that's black
Trying to prove I'm super
While the bass line barks in the woofers
Track liars, trains coming for you goobers
The fat lady is singing notes and ringing of her foopa
I suggest you find a cougar, find a way to dupe her
Into thinking that she's Demi Moore and you are Ashton Kutcher
Because you're fucked otherwise, other guys
Besides, we consider these rhymes lullabies
Sleep tight, fuckers!

[Verse 2]
I'm from where we don't celebrate soccer wins
Where the broke contrast with the opulent
Most on blast for profitin'
While the folks shake cups on the block cement
Marriages on the rocks again
Mom looking for a new pops again
Kids witnessed all the arguments
Now they lose interest when you talk to them
Oh shit, quick, bring a doctor in
We're gonna need Facebook and some oxygen
Stat... (EEEH), bring it back
We got spray tanned children, abandoned buildings
Kids stay still ‘cause the cancer killed 'em
I'll keep moving till I'm handing millions
And I ride till I crash, all kinds of Zildjians
Teachers broke but the man get millions
Or rather, teachers broke but the man get quadrillions
‘Cause the man stay drillin'
We got children, in buildings, with ceilings, that's cracked
While villains got villas, they're chilling, it's whack
But that's the Earth, dig in, or get in the dirt
You got one ear that works, could be worse

[Verse 3]
So if there really is a big fluffy Jesus, tell him let's get weeded
I know he's got connections, text him, look, Ryan Peters' needed
I'm speaking, it's like I'm bleeding, fame like flames pleadin'
I came to change games, it's lame to blame demons
Proclaim the late evenings, take a break, heathens
I seize this beat screamin', I steam while peeps leavin'
The trees creek, I sleep near my family
The Devil ain't a fantasy, I know she wants to dance with me
