[Hook]
I got 24 ounces of Aroma Joe's and I'm back up on my game
I just toured the states for like 40 dates and I just touched back in Maine
I sold more records while I was gone than anybody I know
I got 'em having cows, can't hold my horses and I'm feeling like the GOAT
I'm the GOAT, man I'm the GOAT
Said I'm the GOAT, backwoods iced coffee in my throat
Bumpin' Hall & Oates

[Verse 1]
Ayup
Cool shit in my history
Don't fuck with me, I got kids to feed
Man, remember when you were a dick to me
So when I succeed you aren't shit to me
Bro, what you know 'bout Speezle?
If the canvas on that easel
I'll paint it till I'm famous, heinous dollars out the anus stacking pyramids and eagles
Man I'm counting up that funny
Wait, switch it up, get the M for the F
Just ate but I'm still hungry
Daps everywhere when I enter the set
Now people I admire wanna pound it up
I'm gonna die nasty, better sound the gong
Turn letters into numbers like Algebra
While I'm chasing cheese like I'm Algernon
Get love online like fat women
My future's bright and your past isn't
You stopped sucking, oh that's different
I go so hard my hat's dripping
Your music is boring, I think it's abhorrent
I'm tourin', no lying, your faking is foreign
I was in a Taurus, the oil pan leaking like pictures of Jennifer Lawrence
Fucked up shit, I've been through it
I'm feeling like I'm Jim Breuer
I'm Goat Boy, I'm Goat Man, I spit sunshine even my throat tan
Ducking piglets at rooster o'clock
So guess who's back

Ayup
I can't hold my horses, got too much momentum, what am I to do? (Can't stop me)
My parents divorced and my mom was on welfare, got something to prove (Prove it)
If you hate on people who work hard all day then I don't fuck with you
Got tiger all in my eyeball, Survivor like Destiny's Child, yes
Yes, yes I been weeded, but that's not as cool as all the shit that we did
I might just repeat it, when I'm defeated get right back up on the horse bleeding like Jesus
My confidence big as a moose, but small as a mouse, who let the GOAT in the house?
Second place: I'm not into that
Maine on my back like I'm Simba's dad
But I will never gloat
Get a castle with a moat
Need a goatskin coat
Cause I'm feeling like the GOAT
Go, go, go, go, go, shorty it's your birthday
You could be born last, make it into first place
I'm climbing up onto the tippy-top
Giddy up, they shooting arrows my tibia
But my skin thicker than Nicki's butt
Ducking piglets at rooster o'clock
So, you don't gotta guess who's back
