[Pre-Chorus: Spose]
So pack my bags
Put your hands in your pockets for the very last time, everybody
Get my tank filled up, my work here's done
Tell 'em, "What more can I say? I'll be on my way"

[Chorus: Spose & Dave Gutter]
I'll be on my way
Said I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way, whoa, way
I'll be on my way

[Verse 1: Spose]
Let me take you way back, way back before the present tense
I wanted to hit it, like she's Kim and I'm Eminem
The way she talked, plus her body looking heavensent
I think she'd be a dime if a dime was worth eleven cents
I went to college, came home, I'm at my mom's
Hadn't spoken in months, but got a text from my boss
She's like, "Holy shit! We heard your first album, it's great!
And we're going to the strip club at eight, you tryna come?"
I'm like, "Yeah, man," maybe roommate lap dance
Called Mike, George, said I couldn't blaze, I had plans
Fast forward, now I'm, I'm at the strip club with girls
My boss and her roommate, flyest bitch in the world
There's chicks naked, but I'm focused on her roommate's features
She tells me she's a teacher, then there's Biggie on the speakers
And she's rhyming every word, spitting lyrics out her mouth
Then the next thing I know, we're making out, bro, I made it

[Pre-Chorus: Spose]
You can pack my bags
Put your hands in your pockets for the very last time, everybody
Get my tank filled up, my work here's done
Tell me, what more can I say? I'll be on my way

[Chorus: Spose & Dave Gutter]
I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way, whoa, way
I'll be on my way

[Verse 2: Spose]
Fast forward three months, now she's pregnant
Luckily, she's a smart [censored] independent
Even more impressive than my first impression
Then my boss moves out, I'm in the room she rented
Now I'm making songs, second album in the works
It's gon' be on, plus I'm 'bout to have a kid
It better rock, working sixty hour weeks
Shit, I might need another job, but peep the montage
Signing up for unemployment, new album arrives
U-Haul fills up, alopecia develops, a girl is born
Delivering a pizza, settling content with a baby on my lap
Hands buying albums, signing autographs
She helped me put the second project out when I was unemployed
Now the single, bingo! On the radio, it's making noise
She's like a song without the vocals, she been instrumental
Kissed her 'cause tonight I got a show in Sacramento

[Pre-Chorus: Spose]
Better pack my bags
Put your hands in your pockets for the very last time, everybody
Get my tank filled up, my work here's done
So what more can I say? I'll be on my way

[Chorus: Spose & Dave Gutter]
Said I'll be on my way
I'll be on my way (whoa)
I'll be on my way (we out of here, baby)
Whoa (way) (we out of here, baby)
I'll be on my

[Outro: Spose]
Everybody go buy the Jaw Gems album
Jawgems.bandcamp.com
It's called Heatweaver
And all these beats are from that album
And I made this album in four days
