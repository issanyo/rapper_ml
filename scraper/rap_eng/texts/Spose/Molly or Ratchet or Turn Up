[Hook]
I am still not tough
I don't say "molly" or "ratchet" or "turn up"
I'm not really with it if someone already did it when they spit it
I'm not in the place to trace another image
Man, I am still not tough
I don't say "molly" or "ratchet" or "turn up"
I'm not really with it if someone already did it when they spit it
I'm not in the place to trace another image

[Verse 1]
It's the Wells rap originator, not an imitator
Traitor-eliminator, the hater berator, the litigator
Rhyme self-incriminator, titilater
Independent penchant for the penmanship, writ it, I did it major
Jay hit the fader, I blaze with the skaters
I never change lanes, exchange "Heys" with the neighbors
My name's in the paper, turn flames into vapors
I'm preposterously dank and shit
All these rappers are fake, I wouldn't donate a dollar to them
I'm intolerant when they push a fraudulent pen
If your girlfriend's a four, but you call her a ten
And all of your friends, hype men, with bottles of Hen'
And your stage prostate's clogged with hollerin' men
But the unique speech, you didn't bother to send
You got Spizzy Spose looking like your father again
I wrote a novel or ten while you were followin' trends
I'm pioneering, forging through the underbrush
With blood upon my dungarees, the winter's coming, bundle up
I'm trudging through the jungle weeds, and I don't mean the Thunder Fuck
I don't take some with me, I just break it down to pump it up
I saw your whack live show and I left with a grin
I see you're trying to be like him
If every day you just sway in the wind
When it really comes, that'll be the end

[Hook]
I am still not tough
I don't say "molly" or "ratchet" or "turn up"
I'm not really with it if someone already did it when they spit it
I'm not in the place to trace another image
Man, I am still not tough
I don't say "molly" or "ratchet" or "turn up"
I'm not really with it if someone already did it when they spit it
I'm not in the place to trace another image

[Verse 2]
It's the innovator, non-assimilator, inundator
Blunt incinerator, trunk disintegrator, scintillator
'Frigerator raider, rebel written raper, liberator
I proliferated while you fakers waited in the incubator
Get the grill and put a burger upon
And see me flowin' while I'm mowin', go and circle the lawn
I'm still goin', blowin' potent in the purple at dawn
And I got dirt on my palms, I write the thoroughest psalms
Maybe you heard I'm the bomb, watch me hurtle to Gronk
Watch she gurgle my spawn (Who?), your surrogate mom
I got her burnin', learnin' German while you're urgin' for calm
I bet your rapers referenced sermon never worded is long
See me vocalizing verbals when my thermal is on
â€˜Cause yelling raps in the basement is my permanent job
Think I could make it, I break it with Jacob, I'm taking and  earning applause
I'm highly cavalier as Kyrie Irving, flirting with stars
I got 'em screaming like Drake's there, you think it ain't fair
Now you're cross, like a logo that the Saints wear
Body ape hair, more man than the Salt Lake mare
Snake bare, waitin' in the lake glare
You think I'm kidding like a daycare
I got the weed jar lit, and it's hidden by the bake ware
I was broke, but it's a new day
And now I'm too paid like I'm walking in with fake hair

[Hook]
I am still not tough
I don't say "molly" or "ratchet" or "turn up"
I'm not really with it if someone already did it when they spit it
I'm not in the place to trace another image
Man, I am still not tough
I don't say "molly" or "ratchet" or "turn up"
I'm not really with it if someone already did it when they spit it
I'm not in the place to trace another image
