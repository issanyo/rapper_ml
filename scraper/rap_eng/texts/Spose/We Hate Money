(Intro) Money, Mother Fucking money

(Chorus)
We hate money, Broke people stand up
If you lack cash put your hand up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
Throw all your money on stage
We hate money, dollars, cash, cheese
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine

(Verse 1)
If I ever had money, I would do some crazy shit
I'd probably hire lady gaga to babysit
So give me money, and I'll be like fuck it
I'd drop a hundred grand to make a vegan man eat Turducken
You know I wouldn't hold off, I would spend my figures
I'd get a nose job, make it even bigger
Set my Nissan on fire on the lawn
Then I'd buy my own plane, step on and yell bomb
And as my ego and my pockets swell
I'd fly to the next town to go to taco bell
Then I'd pay all the haters to become believers
I'd pay Kanye West to punch Justin Bieber
And then I'd buy a bunch of heroin and get really arrogant
And pay all the foreigners to become Americans
The possibilities are endless
I would even go to the dentist but

(Chorus)
We hate money, Broke people stand up
If you lack cash put your hand up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
Throw all your money on stage
We hate money, dollars, cash, cheese
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine

(Verse 2)
We've got trash on the porch, We've never owned a Porsche
We only wear neckties to wedding and to court
Our pay gets docked like it's coming into port
So we keep cigars split up like they're getting a divorce
Employees all annoyed, checks all void
Eminem's the only one still employed in Detroit
Bobzins and jobs from Nevada to Dakotas
And we're not Japanese but we're broke as Toyotas
Broseph, I know you is fire and demoted
Drinking tap water because they can't afford sodas
Struggling, covering shifts, just to buy christmas gifts
Before Tiger had mistresses
We're at Walmart, we hate Wallstreet
As far as being in depth, we are balls deep
Collecters call me, fucking all week
But I send that shit straight to voicemail because

(Chorus)
We hate money, Broke people stand up
If you lack cash put your hand up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
Throw all your money on stage
We hate money, dollars, cash, cheese
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine

(Verse 3)
They told us, go to college expand our domes
Now we're jobless with $60,000 loans
And the bank accounts minus, surviving debt
While CEO's fly by in private jets
So, let me see your lighters, the funds couldn't be tighter
And you call orderves, appetizers
If your whole predicaments vile, but your still trying to smile
With the bills piled for miles and miles
Problems we've got 98 plus one
No trust funds, if the cops come we must run
I do it for my belt buckle, black lung, white knuckle
Blue color, cold hearted slave to the dollars that we hate

(Chorus)
We hate money, Broke people stand up
If you lack cash put your hand up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
Throw all your money on stage
We hate money, dollars, cash, cheese
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine

We hate money, so broke people stand up
If you lack cash keep your hands up
We hate money, and all the people getting paid
You can all go away
We hate money (and) dollars (and) cash (and) cheese (and)
Unless your gonna give some to me
We hate money, and everyone who has it
We would do things that you couldn't imagine
So we hate money, money
