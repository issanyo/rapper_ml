[Verse 1: Spose]
I been all over the map tourin'
Austin Groves backyard ball like Bill Corgan
And the dude you saw in Utah with the Mormons
I played football out in the redwood forest
Never knew my life would get so sweet
Had a blunt full of tree out in Pismo Beach
I ain't never had a Tesla or Testarossa
But the best I rolled up out in West Dakota
From Minnesota to Oklahoma
Flex, collect the dough up from show promoters
Sold out in Denver from rapping poems
But nothing feels quite like when I get back home

[Hook]
No matter where I go, doesn't feel quite like Maine
(If you've ever driven through Utah though, that shit looks fuckin' crazy man)
No matter where I go, doesn't feel quite like Maine
(Tryna get out of Connecticut as quickly as possible, no offense)

[Verse 2]
The high fives hit me one more time from Britney
Out in New York City I just signed one titty
Assorted freaks think my aura's sweet
From the Florida beach to the Georgia Peach
I record the beats the I gas the van up
They purchase merch when I hit Atlanta
Been to Alabama, out the hotel peephole
Security know we keep the tree rolled
I crushed Toledo
Each state I step on, my song bangs like emo
Out in AZ, raised like an eyebrow
Kill it out in Chi-town but nothing quite like my town

[Hook]
No matter where I go, doesn't feel quite like Maine
(New Orleans is possibly the greatest city on Earth, however)
No matter where I go, doesn't feel quite like Maine
(Look, Dap even showed up repping Maine and he's from Massachusetts)

[Verse 3: Dap]
Ball in court, this is your speech
Catch me up north, 'round the York Beach
Mass-made, Maine livin'
Ain't different, nah-nah-nah, stay bimpin'
Ladies love Bean boots, Carhartt jacket
Red and black lumberjack, with the hat to match it
No matter my clothes, take the high road
Wonder why am I so happy when I drive home

[Hook]
No matter where I go, doesn't feel quite like Maine
(I bet you guys don't even have a Marden's in your state)
No matter where I go, doesn't feel quite like Maine

[Outro + saxophone solo]
(Oshkosh, Wisconsin)
Doesn't feel quite like Maine
(DeKalb, Illinois)
Doesn't feel quite like Maine
(San Diego)
(Moscow, Russia)
Doesn't feel quite like Maine
(Montpelier, Vermont)
(Bogota, Colombia)
Doesn't feel quite like Maine
(All my people out in Tokyo)
Doesn't feel quite like Maine
(New Brunswick)
Doesn't feel quite like Maine
(I'm just kidding, it's pretty close)
(Hell)
Doesn't feel quite like Maine
