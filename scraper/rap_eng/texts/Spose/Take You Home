[Hook: Grieves]
Everybody won’t you please buckle up
As I step behind the wheel
Gonna take you to a small little town
In the dark where it’s really real
It might look so nice in pictures
But I swear that you don’t know
That underneath the surface all the scary things are lurking
Come on baby let me take you home

[Verse 1: Spose]
As we take a left turn onto roads that’s dirt
We see a raccoon scurry and the crows disperse
And up here on the left, my ex, Barber
Jeff shot his wife to death
Then he turned the gun and killed himself next
And up here on the right
That’s the tree where my sister’s friend Christine
Hit the shit and died when she was 15
Never got drunk or went to precalc
Memorialized in car decals
And on the left if you look into the window ‘hind those evergreens
You’ll see a 23 year old having sex with a girl who is 17
And if we park right here, an owl’s eating a mouse
We see Sandra silhouetted, soundless, leaving her house
To go and cheat on her spouse
Saw my region looking scenic in that picture you took
But you could always find the dirt if you know where to look
Get in the car

[Hook: Grieves]
Everybody won’t you please buckle up
As I step behind the wheel
Gonna take you to a small little town
In the dark where it’s really real
It might look so nice in pictures
But I swear that you don’t know
That underneath the surface all the scary things are lurking
Come on baby let me take you home

[Verse 2: Spose]
As we continue the voyage into southern Wells
That’s the barn where my homie’s sister hung herself
We never talked about it when we’re there for dinner
Even though the walls still got all her school pictures
Oh that restaurant over there, that’s a tourist trap
Where my buddy Jack’s dad snapped like a quarterback
It was Friday evening, man it must have been insane
He tried to run over Jack’s stepdad at the custody exchange
Meanwhile, in the kitchen of the restaurant
The cook feel blurry, it's plural Estefan’s
Grinding the teeth in his tattoo’d face
Did coke off the toilet in his bathroom break
And up here on the right, one night was snowy white like cool whip
I came across this chick I went to school with walking by herself
I said, “Online, it looking like you were living the dream”
She wiped a tear, said, “Things aren’t always what they seem”

[Hook: Grieves]
Everybody won’t you please buckle up
As I step behind the wheel
Gonna take you to a small little town
In the dark where it’s really real
It might look so nice in pictures
But I swear that you don’t know
That underneath the surface all the scary things are lurking
Come on baby let me take you home

[Verse 3: Spose]
My blinker signal like a vigil in the darkest of night
Venus and Mars, stars all sparkling bright
Take a look at that apartment there on your right
That’s where my friend Kate lived the hardest of lifes
She was pretty, eighth grade had the carnal delights
She had a baby, born disabled, but this part isn’t right
Kate loved her as a mother, but she was 8 when she died
Now even when she’s full, Kate feels empty inside
But suffering is nothing new, you can’t be that surprised
'Cause there were 40 thousand in the Abenaki tribe
By 1758, we killed ‘em all off
All these little kid bodies hauled off with smallpox
These roads paved on their graves, waves crash like accidents
Killed them all then named our yearbook after ‘em
You might not see it when you're staying in Maine
But it gets real when you peel away the layers of paint

[Hook: Grieves]
Everybody won’t you please buckle up

Come on baby let me take you home

[Outro: Grieves]
Take you home
Let me take you home, yeah
Getting dark outside, yeah
It’s getting dark outside, uh
It’s getting dark outside, yeah
Baby run and hide
It’s getting dark outside
Let me take you home, yeah
It’s getting dark outside
Baby go run and hide
It’s getting dark outside, yeah
You know it
Fuck off
