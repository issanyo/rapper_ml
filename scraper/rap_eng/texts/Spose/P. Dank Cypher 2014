[Intro: Spose]

What's up world?
We're the Preposterously Dank crew, PDank for short
My man Shane Reis, Lady Essence, Mike Be, Jay Caron & Cam Groves are with you tonight
My name is Spose, we're happy to be coming to you live from Portland, Maine

If you don't like us, die

[Verse 1: Shane Reis]

Ok, the moniker is Reis, it's not spelled like Riesling
You caught me chilling with Belle in the East Wing, I'm beasting
And that's a song you don't normally hear me sing
But that being the point, that I don't point out these things
I got a job, and rap is just a hobby son
Your style's a spotty one, probably you should copy one
I let you brew in that, how could I not be one?
When I b's doing me to a T even when hockey's done
I'm a respectable young dude, fuck 'em all
Catch me in the west end, stooping with a double malt
Step upstairs, I'm eating steak with a bib on
Two Buck Chuck from Trader Joe's, I live on
Ok, I been on, the type of shit I'm on player
I'm in the bath writing raps over John Mayer
But still, I am that little brother, get back
You're more like Lil B, collaborating with Riff Raff

That's for your bitch ass

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]

Cam Groves, PDank, 2014 son

Yo, I'll turn you to a fan, buy my music on Amazon
Sleeping on Cam like they got flannel pajamas on
It's no glamour when my man flips the Canon on
Damn it's on when they put the camera on Cameron
Keep it random every time I get my ramble on
Hand the bong over, Imma jam it with a gram of chron'
Keep jammin' till I'm paid a hundred grand a song
And everyone's enamored by the land that I stand upon
Now I'm acting like there ain't no one as hot as me
Everybody got a dream, I don't do it modestly
If my music ever caught a buzz like a shot of three
I'd grab that mother fucker and then hold it like I gotta pee
Rappers wanna throttle me
Bitches wanna follow me
You don't make the cut, like assisting a lobotomy
If you think you're sicker and you wish you'd take a shot at me
You bitches stand a better chance at fixing the economy

Or hitting the lottery

[Verse 3: Mike B]

Yeah, Mighty Mike B
Ock Cousteau
Check it out

Yo, the sand was blowing on the coast, they had the cameras rolling
Suddenly, commotion is picking up and the man's approaching
The monster that swam the entire span of the ocean
He fuckin' ran, when I hit the land and I'm standin' and posin'
Dammit I'm chosen, might believe I'm not a sleeper
My right hand controls the mic and lights a lot of reefer
The scholar that taught the teacher, Be's a proper leader
And I never even need to breathe when underwater either
Preposterous, chronic in the esophagus
Royalty in the roster, plates of pasta with lobster bisque
Uh, we stay ahead of the fakes
And you gon' see me in the sea, like some negative space
Y'all are shallow and fake
I'm going for the ocean's depth
And when my vocals flex, I'm leaving locals with a broken rep
So go and check for us, we're proper when we rock the show
And watch out for the project with the audibles that's nautical
Peace

[Verse 4: Essence]

On my harbor fish shit
Yeah

I'm on my, scour the fakeness
Straight devour the stages
While tryna make up for these cowards, now go powder your faces
Let me show you why you proud of where the power in Maine is
The CMP of freaking beats while making hourly wages,  fuck your
Salary raises and your benefit jobs
You benefit when pens a life and craft a sentence for God
And cause the exodus of pegasus on a nebulous fog
Regulating record sprints while on a regular jog
I'm on my, peg your facade and then expose the real in you
Dog, your flows flawed and no one's even feeling you
It must suck to know that everything you fuckin' wrote
Truly is the weakest, keep it secret homie tuck it low
I'm on my tuck-and-roll and never had a problem with
Showing to the show so I could leave it with like all your friends
Let's call amends, for Ock walks you on the sea plank
Withs swords in your face, know your place, homie PDank

[Verse 5: Jay Caron]

Ay yo I'm hooked on phonics
Fuck it I'm hooked on chronic
Pool swimming, fly women, man my life's aquatic
I was finger fucking at 9-3, bumping Onyx
Watching the Suns game 6, it was verse the Sonics
You want brolic? Grrrr
You want knowledge? Hmmmm
I been a beast over beats since I dropped out college
From the coast, on the beach, where I feast on walrus
Send a tweet, to your peeps, that I'm awfully flawless
Good lord, it's one beat, no need for a chorus
Watch 'em spit a 16 while Red Stallion records it
Cape Porpoise, Ock see, getting endorsements
We scourging your laws, better call reinforcements
Separately strong, but stronger connected
No need to, beg for attention in order to get accepted
Loved and hated, anticipated, but highly respected
We all say "fuck it, we love it," let's put it down for the record

[Verse 6: Spose]

Look
I'm fucking starving and these rappers looking bite-sized
Non fiction, got it woven in my tight rhymes
The day I write lies? That'll be the day the Kardashians decide they're gonna fuck broke white guys
P DANK
The future is ours
They say "Oh Ryan," well that's proof I'm a star
They wanna come and kill us while we're looping the bars
But we know they all wouldn't like acoustic guitars
So who are you? We got next on it
You're doing little numbers like the exponent
My steez, wolly mammoth-type, made in Maine
Your career disappeared, like the Malaysian plane
We need an intervention, quick attention, get some friends and let 'em know my diction dances, fists are clenched, dog
The differential kid is mental, big potential, pen and pencil, quintessential, instrumental God
Mother fucking Peter

[Outro: Spose]
PDank in the house
We'll see you in 2015, 2016, 2017
Running for President in 2029, all of us
