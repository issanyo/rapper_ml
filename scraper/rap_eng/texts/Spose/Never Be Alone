[Verse 1]
Fools think that I should put the mic down I'm like "how?"
I've got these lines on my palms and my arms
I've been writing these songs for so long
A lesser man would give in to depression but I'm pressing on
I went from crooked hat looking for a better bong
To dad days, Malbec, crab cakes, remoulade
I'm all set like tables in a restaurant
With ever spitting fiction made up like its Revlon
Son, my reign started back when they put my record on
It got gold without ever meeting leprechauns
And when it all came together like its Megatron
I never got gassed up, I haven't been to Chevron
If you supported me you know I'm never gone
They like "Awesome," you know I got better songs
They want to write me off
I think they read it wrong
I had this down to a T before you put the kettle on
Maine flowing I'm the horse you should've betted on
Stacking up the feta with the height short cheddar long
My fans helping me to get along
So give them a big hand
Like the video for "Everlong"
Spose, bringing it on
The People's Douche and the writer of wrongs
I wrote this all alone on a page
But I step on stage and

[Hook]
They're singing along
They're singing alo-o-o-ong
If you keep me with you
I'll never be alone

[Verse 2]
I feel unencumbered
It is he who achieved his dreams with no slumber
Yeah, scrawny with the sumo bars
A top 40 song, no hook by Bruno Mars
I made the DJs hit replay quick
Back in summer '06 when TJ quit
Admittedly giddy when Biggie is on
But when I step on stage they're singing a...
Kesha song cause my fans are twelve
But so is Tom Brady and he slams Gisele
And this isn't the strategy I planned in Wells
But I'll get this shit right before I'm tanned in Hell
My plan to get rich and help Cam as well
We'll get the PDank brand to sell
I spit the jingles that'll tickle your mom
I'll get her and God both

[Hook]
They're singing along
They're singing alo-o-o-ong
If you keep me with you
I'll never be alone

[Verse 3]
I started out freestyling over party beats
With a bank account that was r-e-d
Like the Blast, with DJ Jon
Which was the first place that ever put a Spose song on
Well, besides Appleton
Maine Hip-hop, not an oxymoron nor an accident
So keep cackling
We're multiplying undivided
When it's minus five do the math again
Shit's baffling, blunts crackling
We got the goods if you got the woods to wrap it in
With no palaces and no talismans
Reverse middle finger thrown up like a javelin
Pine tree state
The nights here cold
The rhymes been great since I'm none years old
With no bling on at all
You put some EA on and they're singing a-

[Hook]
They're singing along
They're singing alo-o-o-ong
If you keep me with you
I'll never be alone
