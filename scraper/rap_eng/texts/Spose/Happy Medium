[Verse 1: Spose]
Yeah, I used to just be blunts by the beach
Now I'm tutoring rappers with the avuncular speech
I vocalize on beats, what local guys see
But they hate him villainously cause he says it verbatim
I know writers evolved to be very vampiric
I'm in white vans touring Toledo or damn near it
I lose track of these Larrys and Sues
I'm who various dudes live vicarious through
Emceed live like a bee-hive, buzz built up
But, is he a white dwarf or a milk dud?
Dope duds you can keep them on the mannequin
Dude does not change his clothes, ask Cameron
Wrangled mics, ramblin' with jamborees of emcees
Spittin frees, lackin' luxuries or pamperin'
Hamperin' careers, pushin' peers to embarrassment
Laughin' - Doug Funny - cause the money's gargantuan
Bic below my belt buckle, bound for a blunt-ski
Stick stem sterilized, Stiky in the front seat
I promise to be brutally honest
I still spill gin and tonics on a lotta 'lectronics
Tattoo parlor, new needle tickinlin', I'm milky, way high Snickerin' at rappers bickerin'
I'd rather joke jubilant, doodlin' rhymes, hooverin' ramen noodles
Get that loot but stay frugal

[Chorus: Stiky-1]
I don't wanna change what I do
I don't really see the point
I've been doing just - fine
So I'm gon' do what I've been doin'
Til' the day I lay down
I've been happy medium
I've been livin' in Wells, Maine
Wells, Maine

[Verse 2: Spose]
Turn off the bright lights
I like my place in society betwixt anonymity and notoriety (Go!)
I've been happy medium, small town, Double XL dreams
Those are the ingredients
Without want for a wondrous whip
Just a spot to spit, sleep, eat, and take a shit
Deny me the decadence - just give me people in attendance
Independent of their necklaces and pendants
Because everyone's pretending still (still)
I mean there's something so hollow in those Hollywood Hills
I need substance - as in not fake
Snakes who take your Land o' Lakes and then skip your wake
I don't need TVs
Invadin' my village, villifying my visage when I'm out with my missus
I gave you my blemishes from the genesis
Others generally disingenuous
I'm given you what's really going on behind the Maybelline creams
When the Revlon's gone, where the jewels don't gleam
Where the stars are black holes
The pitch-black back roads, past the last toll
Me? I'm from nowhere, no pimp, no player
When I spit it they all come together like Pangaea
I'm sayin' what I've been sayin'
Stayin' where I've been stayin' (Where's that?)
Happy Medium

[Chorus: Stiky-1]
I don't wanna change what I do
I don't really see the point
I've been doing just - fine
So I'm gon' do what I've been doin'
Til' the day I lay down
I've been happy medium
I've been livin' in Wells, Maine
Wells, Maine
