[Verse 1: Spose]
It's the King of Maine
But I remember getting in the game
Everybody told me I'm insane
"He should stay in college, quit the rappin'
Save a dollar, it won't happen"
They gave up and they told me to do the same
But I knew I was gonna bang
Knew I was emoji with the flames
Even when your homie told me I was lame
Now he wants a verse
Bro, twenty million out the purse
In my Gmail, replied on the plane
Now I bag work, I don't mean coke I mean merch
Twenty-five dollars for a shirt
Since I pay six that's nineteen, profit for a hit
I'm a prophet to these kids, I'm like a church, Speezus Christ
Used to work morning to the night
So another man could live a better life
Minimally pay me then he's whipping a Mercedes
Something shady, so I made it to the majors out of spite
That's right

[Hook: Spose & Shang-High]
You doubted, you doubted
Can't do shit about it, I'm 'bout it
They told me, "Keep quiet, don't try it, just be Ryan"
But I told 'em, "I'm shouting"
Feeling like, "Haaaan," the way I went solo
Check me out, no 'nother man's logo on my polo
Ooh, did it all on my own now
Tried to put me in the box, but I broke out
I feel like a living legend in my hometown
No other man's logo, got no other man's logo on my polo

[Verse 2: Spose]
Thirty-five hunnid for the show
That's the number right before I blow
Me, I used to work for ten fifty in the kitchen
Boss bitchin' in my vision 'cause there wrinkles in my clothes
Now I write the checks, I don't know what city up next
If you think I'm bimpin' you would be correct
I got fans to my left and some money to my right
I made what you made in a month in one night
Now I'm walking in New Orleans with my homies
And I'm tanning on my shoulder blades
This is what you couldn't see in older days
When I was bumping Odelay
Till I got a whip with a roof that could fold away
Or secret service jogging by my motor cave
If I had listened
My trophies and plaques in the glass wouldn't glisten
I had premonitions but they were dismissive
Thought I was lost, but now boss my description
And if I had listened to you, I'd probably still have the apron
That goes around back and then ties in the front
I quit my job, I'm my boss
I can do what I want, so just pass me the blunt

[Hook: Spose & Shang-High]
You doubted, you doubted
Can't do shit about it, I'm 'bout it
They told me, "Keep quiet, don't try it, just be Ryan"
But I told 'em, "I'm shouting"
Feeling like, "Haaaan," the way I went solo
Check me out, no 'nother man's logo on my polo
Ooh, did it all on my own now
Tried to put me in the box, but I broke out
I feel like a living legend in my hometown
No other man's logo, got no other man's logo on my polo

[Verse 3: Spose]
I don't split a dollar with a person
P. Dank Records on the jersey
'Cause the power of my mind make a hour of my time worth more
Motherfuckers can't afford me
You could do this too
I was just like you
One-two-zero-seven
But I been waking up and tryin' to get it
'Cause I never wanna go back to my old job
I'm not complacent, pacin', waitin' for a phone call
They didn't see it, so I guess I had to show y'all
Bro, my whole circle cold like a snow ball
It's the P. Dank clan, that's me, Jay, Cam
Mike Be, Shane and Essence
Flexin' repossession, check the replay cam
If you doubt us, this is payback
Middle finger to a name tag

[Outro: Shang-High]
Ooh, did it all on my own now
Tried to put me in the box, but I broke out
