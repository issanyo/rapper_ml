[Intro]

[Verse 1: Spose]
Give me eight bars, I'll make them fly like a catapult
Because of my locality you think we're incompatible?
That my product would divide the people, mathematical?
You think that it's irrational to try to make it national?
I had the same game plan until I came into bigger checks
Same turn-table, same cable, same internet
Same cigarettes, I grab life by the taint
Until townsfolk in Hoboken spoke my name

[Verse 2: Ghost]
But they told me I couldn't get to where I'm trying to go
From the state of trees, lakes, ice fishing and snow
Bucks and does, double Hemi trucks and roads
Made of dirt, It wouldn't work if you're trying to blow
Well I s'pose you're wrong, because songs are in rotation
Hear Maine rap blazin' on stations across the nation
As long as I'm patient, improving my preparation
It's possible, still the local yuppies they be sayin'

[Hook: Spose]
Are you out of your brain?
Rapping from Maine?
You must be insane!
(Well you can't get there from here)
[Spose]
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You must have lost your mind
I mean those rhymes
They were fine for the time, but you
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You're from the easternmost
Northernmost, bordermost state
You can't be great
(You can't get there from here)

[Verse 3: Cam Groves]
I told them that I rap
They say that I'm absurd
Just because I'm from the burbs
I got to listen to Disturbed?
Do what you want, you got the power
It's your life, I'm from Maine and white
And still hot chowder on the mic
Some real and some fake
Too humblay for gunplay
I pay for the studio
And do it all in one take
One day, they told me
Don't quit your day job
Now I'm laughing
Being different finally paid off

[Verse 4: Lady Essence]
No matter if it's supreme
Its a genius within my region
If the M to the E gives reason not to believe it
See I'm seasoning the season
Winter, splinters to bleeding
My image splitting your teeth
Because I got more than like three men
And even though I got this moxie sound
Y'all look at me crookedly because
I work at a lobster pound
Watch it now, my pockets round
But lobster bins still by the pound
But still I keep more iller
Came and keyed you before you locked it down

[Hook: Spose]
Are you out of your brain?
Rapping from Maine?
You must be insane!
(Well you can't get there from here)
[Spose]
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You must have lost your mind
I mean those rhymes
They were fine for the time, but you
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You're from the easternmost
Northernmost, bordermost state
You can't be great
(You can't get there from here)

[Verse 5: Jay Caron]

We're from the state that resides
At the top of the map
But don't assume that we don't know
The math on doing these tracks
You see, as MC's we push it to a higher degree
Because it is, what we believe
That we were destined to be
So we be doing work, putting in time
Searching online, spitting these lines
And mic rules, we craft and design
To take em places, my energy will never be wasted
Because to get there from here is gonna take a lot of patience

[Verse 6: Spose]

So keep the firewood sparked
Where the moose aren't sparse
If you rap like Spose
Well I guess that's a start
Then sell out the bar
If you want to get far
And then help the DJ
Go put the tables in the car
Yeah I'm coming for the title now
Whiter than a bridle gown
I'm from the state of Maine
I can spell it, you should write it down
Roads one lane, streets no lights
I spit hot shit just to stay warm on cold nights

[Hook: Spose]
Are you out of your brain?
Rapping from Maine?
You must be insane!
(Well you can't get there from here)
[Spose]
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You must have lost your mind
I mean those rhymes
They were fine for the time, but you
(You can't get there from here)
[Spose]
You're from the easternmost
Northernmost, bordermost state
You can't be great
(You can't get there from here)
