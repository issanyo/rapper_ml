See me riding in the '03 Altima, feeling like a boss
‘Cause I just got paid and I got the day off
60 hours last week, that's 700 bucks
Now I can pay my speeding ticket and buy bud

[Verse 1]
Man I've been broke since last
Saturday I had to go to coinstar with a jar just to get gas
To get to work where I'm flipping burgers till I get swamp ass
My folks don't own no business
I just cut fish and did dishes, but when it's pay day, I'm bimpin'
I've got old dudes in my pants, pause, Ulysses S. Grant, dawg
Had a lot of long days now I'm whippin', bimpin', bumping Andre and Antwan, that's OutKast
I'm a misfit, I got no whips for Christmas
My broke folks if you listenin', sing this shit

[Bridge]
You could fuck way more women, spend way more cash
You could rock two chains, you could kick my ass
You could drink more liquor, you could smoke more weed
But you'll never feel as good as me

[Verse 2]
Let me see your hands high if your cash low
If your manager is an asshole
If your favorite band broke up
But you couldn't get the shift off for their last show
You're working nine days a week, now
You and your girl don't speak, but
When you get your paycheck
You can buy the liquor that'll make her wanna freak
Do that shit that makes you feel personally
Like Spose does when he puts a verse to beats
When you get to upgrade from commercial weed
And you stop by your work for just a beat
‘Cause you're a have not, got a padlock
On the bulkhead, your dad's spot
Then yell this shit like Ad-Rock when it mmm drops

[Bridge]
You could fuck way more women, spend way more cash
You could rock two chains, you could kick my ass
You could drink more liquor, you could smoke more weed
But you'll never feel as good as me

[Verse 3]
I just got a order in
Right after I cleaned the grill (I cleaned the grill)
I've been working overtime
But it still doesn't cover the bills (It don't cover the bills)
My landlord raised my rent again
Then my boss cut my hours back (Cut my hours back)
So how will I get ahead?
Unless they cut me some slack (Cut me some slack)
Man, my credit isn't rated A, so you know where I'll B
Working, burning pirated CD's, whipping with my gas tank on E
Dressed like I don't give a F, bank account negative one G
Can't afford to say H I to a J, but if you hit me on payday
I'll front the loop, I'll buy the bag, I'll cop the beer, I'll pay the tab
I'll drive the whip, I'll buy the gas, I got this shit, don't gotta pay me back
I'm feeling like I'm Sean:
Carter, Daley, "Puffy" Combs, and when it's all gone, fuck it

[Hook]
I'm still ridin' in my '03 Altima, feeling like a boss
‘Cause I just got paid and I got the day off
60 hours last week, that's 700 bucks
Now I can pay my speeding ticket and buy bud
