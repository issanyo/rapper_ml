[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, Dankonia
Peter Sparker, Spizzy Spose, Maine Gretzky
It's the return

[Verse]
I got no lies in my lyrics, did coke lines at my parents'
No co-signs, but the road signs say "Maine," I got my bearings
I got whole milk in my coffee, bro, give me a topic
I'll flip it how they wouldn't think of flippin' it, isn't it funny how cats sound copied?
I got no fights I been in, size thirty my denim
Interior cluttered, exterior dented
Me, I had a major label with a big amount, and I wish that I hadn't spent it now
Went up in smoke, now I'm broke, no cash, so I overdraft my check account
Can't afford no reefer, can't afford no features
They say my name, I used to be in the game, now I'm sitting up in those bleachers
My wrist still not blingin', phone still not ringin'
Gmail, check forty times a day but no new messages in it
You wanna know what's even more? My booking agent was Peter Schwartz
He booked Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller and he slept on me then we divorced
But it's like he never knew me though, finally told him it was time to go
He said "OK" and he told me that my shit reminds him of Coolio
(What?) Really dude my shit reminds you of Coolio?
Is the alphabet full of numerals? Did you dudes forget that I'm super dope?
That I'm proven human spewing truly moving shit for the dudes and bros
Up in Maine where it's two below and I don't rap 'bout no groupie hoes
You think my shit sounds like Coolio?
Fuck!

[Outro]
Fucking...
Ten years of lyrical shit...
Three albums, two mixtapes...
Dense ass verses and I sound like Coolio? (C'mon...)
