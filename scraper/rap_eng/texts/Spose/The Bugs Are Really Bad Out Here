[Verse 1: Spose]
I was focused and fly like locusts in the sky
'til the cocoon broke and I arrived, you wanna pimp a butterfly?
I swarm to get more light
Can't stop feelin' like a moth to the porch light
Fendin' off competitors, my wings in a sword fight
I will be the last one alive, it's not Fortnite
It's wicked in the thicket
Staccato chirpin', listen, the crickets are violinists
I'm runnin' from a dozen mosquitos, it's vampiric
Eatin' off you and your buds and you can't hear it
Woods aren't safe, you could get hurt in there
I put bug spray all over my sweatshirt and hair, because the

[Chorus: Lily Frost, Spose & Chris Webby]
Bugs are really bad out here
The bugs are really bad out here
Smack 'em if you catch 'em, do the best you can
Not surprised, you gotta play calm around this way
(I said the) bugs are really bad out here
B-b-bugs are bad out here
Smack 'em if you catch 'em, do the best you can (Webby)
Not surprised, you gotta play calm around this way

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I'm comin' from the, top soil, I be movin' underneath the grass
My hive is loyal, so don't make them killer bees attack
Evil, half arachnid with that venom drippin' off the fangs
A white reclusey, my bite induces an awful pain (ow!)
It's all a game as I spin 'em into the web
Kill 'em dead, pluck they wings and rip off all six of they legs (ha)
Webby sick in the head, I need some different meds
Disregardin' what the motherfuckin' syllabus said
Because the (bugs are really bad out here) you'll hear 'em creepin' up
Those lawless creepy crawlers all just wanna eat you up
Firefly burnin' you, with a clever word or two
Rock a yellow jacket with a sting that you're allergic to
I'm that golden scarab that's inscribed in the sarcophagus
No insecticide that could stop this shit and it's obvious
To every entomologist that ain't nobody hotter
So bitch, go and get your fly swatter, 'cause now you know the

[Chorus: Lily Frost & Spose]
Bugs are really bad out here
The bugs are really bad out here
Smack 'em if you catch 'em, do the best you can
Not surprised, you gotta play calm around this way
(Watch out, the) bugs are really bad out here
B-b-bugs are bad out here
Smack 'em if you catch 'em, do the best you can
Not surprised, you gotta play calm around this way
(I said the) bugs are really bad out here
The b-b-bugs are bad out here
Smack 'em if you catch 'em, do the best you can
Not surprised, you gotta play calm around this way

[Verse 3: Spose]
You better stay completely awake, it's not just the bugs
But the leeches and snakes that greet you, sweet to your face
And then mistreat you while they're creepin' and deplete your estate
You're at the beach or the lake, while they eat you, delete you
We leap through repeated evils
I got stung by my last offer, I know the bite still itch
But if you're tryna be The Beatles
You better jump like a grasshopper, can't be scared to get bit
And the slugs hit your atmosphere, turn heads to gelatin
Chunky Carhartt on my exoskeleton
To fight parasites, I go with home remedies
'cause my dreams got legs like a centipede
My antenna up, a canister tucked
'cause you could vanish in a panic in the planet of bugs
So if you're walkin' in the woods, then you better be Spiderman
I ran in the house, I won't go out there at night again, the

[Chorus: Lily Frost & Spose]
Bugs are really bad out here
The bugs are really bad out here
Smack 'em if you catch 'em, do the best you can
Not surprised, you gotta play calm around this way
(I said the) bugs are really bad out here
B-b-bugs are bad out here
(You better) smack 'em if you catch 'em, do the best you can
Not surprised, you gotta play calm around this way
