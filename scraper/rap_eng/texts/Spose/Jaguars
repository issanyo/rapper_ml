[Chorus]
I might, ayup
I might throw a hundred on the Jacksonville Jaguars
‘Cause that's the same likelihood as me being a rap star
I don't ever lie to people, plus I never act hard
Okay, fuck it, I just put a thousand on the Jaguars
Jaguars
On the Jaguars
I might fuck around and put a thousand on the Jaguars
(You're crazy) On the Jaguars
Fuck it, on the Jaguars
I'm a Pats fan, put a thousand on the Jaguars

[Verse 1: Spose]
People enslaved by their psyche, they follow the rules and their plans man
They say, "It's very unlikely," I said "Oh, you mean there's a chance, then"
If I had told you back then (way back)
I'm gonna make a hundred grand a year
Even though I'm white like a Santa beard
Selling rap music in an amphitheater
You woulda told me I'm almonds
You woulda said "Oh man what you been smoking? What's that type of weed? Whatchu call it?"
But I wasn't scared, I went all in
See I did what they advise against
All your parents and your lawyers
I put it all on the long shot, that's crosscourt, for a four-pointer
You wish you had done that in hindsight
I saw at dawn what you gon' see at twilight
I wasn't supposed to win my life, so when it's all on the line you know I might, I might

[Chorus]
I might throw a hundred on the Jacksonville Jaguars
‘Cause that's the same likelihood as me being a rap star
I don't ever lie to people, plus I never act hard
Okay, fuck it, I just put a thousand on the Jaguars
Jaguars
On the Jaguars
I might fuck around and put a thousand on the Jaguars
(You're crazy) On the Jaguars
Fuck it, on the Jaguars
I'm a Pats fan, put a thousand on the

[Verse 2: Spose]
Why does keeping it real not come easy? (Tell me the truth)
I can't front, I feel like an endangered species (Jaguars)
I know the chances are slim, but I feel like something is shady (Shady)
‘Cause why when people are telling the truth do we act like those people are crazy?
Don't look back behind the scenes
Don't tell the peeps how it seems
Don't let your eye get the gleam
You might end up on a meme
Quick to turn you to the laughing stock till the passion stops
You better get complacent
Tell people, "He's smoking crack," or, "He musta took an acid drop, this guy is crazy"
You might get popped like a black kid sitting at a traffic stop, you better watch out
If you walk too far from the fucked up tree that the apple drop
They said "Hey kid, move along, everything is fine here
You could get a little bit of money, not no ideas"
I got an idea, fuck that shit, go mad hard, mad hard
I just put a billion on the Jaguars

[Chorus]
I might throw a hundred on the Jacksonville Jaguars
‘Cause that's the same likelihood as me being a rap star
I don't ever lie to people, plus I never act hard
Okay, fuck it, I just put a thousand on the Jaguars
Jaguars
On the Jaguars
I might fuck around and put a thousand on the Jaguars
On the Jaguars
Fuck it, on the Jaguars
I'm a Pats fan, put a thousand on the Jaguars

[Verse 3: Cam Groves]
The bigger the risk, the bigger the pleasure (real big)
If I was alive, I would have invested in Nikola Tesla (who?)
Cause I idolize those who think differently given the pressure
And going the distance and staying persistent no matter the measure (keep going)
It's either stay or fold (stay or fold)
You gotta play or go
Either take control and break the mold, either pay a toll or pave a road
Oh, too many people think the same thoughts
I don't care about the odds, keep playing till the game's lost
No matter what you do for work, remember you're your main boss
Gotta listen to the kids ‘cause most adults are brainwashed
Y'all pacified, it's like the passion died (bye)
The world's packed with lies, you're passing by never asking why (how come?)
And my thoughts are crazy
Often maybe, but it never stopped me from operating
Never stop creating, and the one thing I am not is lazy like woo (woo woo woo)
The harder you go, the more you learn (we learning)
When the odds are low, the more you earn (get money)
I hope you ready for that hook, y'all
Thousand on the Jags and I don't even watch football

[Chorus]
I might throw a hundred on the Jacksonville Jaguars
‘Cause that's the same likelihood as me being a rap star
I don't ever lie to people, plus I never act hard
Okay, fuck it, I just put a thousand on the Jaguars
Jaguars
On the Jaguars
I might fuck around and put a thousand on the Jaguars
On the Jaguars
Fuck it, on the Jaguars
I'm a Pats fan, put a thousand on the Jaguars

[Outro: Spose]
And yeah, I really gotta get on that We Smoked It All 3 too, but I mean we're pretty close. When you write down all the tracks we got, we just need like, a couple more. Um, I'm gonna re-write my "Old Now" verse...
