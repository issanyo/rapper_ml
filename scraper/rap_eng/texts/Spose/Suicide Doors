[Chorus: P.MO]
We all wanna ride and we all wanna shine
In the whip with the suicide doors
Maybe they call 'em that cause once you got it all
What do you want for?
When the light gets too hot and there's nowhere to hide
They miss you while you're here and love you after you die
Fine by appearance but broken inside
Hard to stay grounded after you learn how to fly, oh my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my

[Verse 1: Spose]
I was in the Chevy Cavalier when the mountaintop killed Kurt
Shotgun bedding and a stain on his shirt
Hard to believe everything that we read
Another day another (ugh), gone too soon
This shit is not new news, how many times now?
Who's next to Chester, Lil Peep and Amy Winehouse?
Walking up the stairway to heaven, watch 'em file out
On top of the mountain, got nowhere that we can climb now
Mac Miller probably still be alive if he never blew
Ambition more expensive than the coupe
Once you achieve it, they don't tell you what to do
Like, dude you got too much green to be blue
Don't come lookin' for some sympathy
Enshrine all your missteps in infamy
The car crash get publicity
The sneaking pictures of you when you with your fam
But they'd kill you if you did that to them
You get the cash, cash cash, all of this cash
Flash, flash flash, gone in a flash
American dreaming that we can believe in
But it's a nightmare how we treat the ones who achieve it
But still we-

[Chorus: P.MO]
We all wanna ride and we all wanna shine
In the whip with the suicide doors
Maybe they call 'em that cause once you got it all
What do you want for?
When the light gets too hot and there's nowhere to hide
They miss you while you're here and love you after you die
Fine by appearance but broken inside
Hard to stay grounded after you learn how to fly, oh my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my

[Verse 2: Spose]
We all watch the throne, throw stones
And we all want it for our own
But heavy is the crown on the dome
Nowhere to hide, need a hat in disguise
To walk to buy a coffee and a basket of fries
No one'll empathize if you happen to cry
In that quarter-mil car, 'bro must be real hard'
No comedy like Apatow, diss you while alive
When you die, we come back around
RIP for half an hour, 'ooh yeah we were always down'
We pray to be Ye, but I heard Ye say he'd have his grave emblazoned "are you happy now?"
We had the same dream back in the day
We're at the zoo laughing at you as we tap on the cage
You ask, "Is this it?" like the Strokes
Search L.A. for hope
End up prescriptions, addicted to coke
Make decision, put incision in your wrist and then go
Cause it didn't shine behind all that did glisten and glow
Eating all these M&M's, might've turned into a pill addiction
Right around the encore, not enough, we want more
As good as your sophomore, go higher than pot stores
Gas you up then pull you down and wonder what you popped for
We all wanna ride, till the car won't stop
We're all gonna die
They tell you you should go high as God in the sky
Let you fall from grace and then we flock to your side
But nonetheless I know we-

[Chorus: P.MO]
We all wanna ride and we all wanna shine
In the whip with the suicide doors
Maybe they call 'em that cause once you got it all
What do you want for?
When the light gets too hot and there's nowhere to hide
They miss you while you're here and love you after you die
Fine by appearance but broken inside
Hard to stay grounded after you learn how to fly, oh my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my

[Verse 3: Spose]
If you've ever seen the comments section
Then you know why fame comes with depression
"I hope you die, slut, thot, fat, ugly, photoshopped"
Every dick's opinion from inner Finland to Omaha
Hitting all your ugly angles, paparazzi intervening
Reporters might make you cop a eating disorder
Bro if they were scrutinizing me, I'd end up with a nose job, a chin job, some botox, a dick job, a coke problem
Wanted to be famous so that they'd know what my name is
But that tightrope walk is dangerous, demon bring me to an angel
If Kim K snaps and unloads a strap on every Mandy and Randy insulting her family
I got her back over trolls and jerks
Look, I probably wouldn't last 20 minutes as her
If I couldn't eat dinner in peace
And people expecting me to be a, 10 instead of a 3
And viewed me competitively to celebrities
I would snap like, chat
I would blast right, back
I would crack, probably end up the same place as Mac
Probably wanna end me, big mansion empty

[Pre-Chorus: Spose]
We all want the suicide doors, till the suicide's knocking on yours
We all want the suicide doors, till the suicide's knocking on

[Chorus: P.MO]
We all wanna ride and we all wanna shine
In the whip with the suicide doors
Maybe they call 'em that cause once you got it all
What do you want for?
When the light gets too hot and there's nowhere to hide
They miss you while you're here and love you after you die
Fine by appearance but broken inside
Hard to stay grounded after you learn how to fly, oh my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my oh my, oh my my
Oh my

[Outro]
I've said before, the internet is a, is a big high school, and the little kids on there are bullying artists. And they, and they be surprised when artists are talking about pain, and, and you know, "this is too much," and "this is crazy." Y'all are the bullies, but then you post four picture collages on Twitter about mental health, but then turn around and contribute to the downside of an artists' mental health. Y'all are buggin, you know what I'm saying? Y'all are literally poison. And the more famous you get, the more uglier the world gets. The more famous you get, the more uglier the world gets. The more famous you get, the more uglier the world gets
