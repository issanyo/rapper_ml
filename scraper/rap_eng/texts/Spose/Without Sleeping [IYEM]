[Hook: Shane Reis]
From when the ball's up till the ball drop
From the sunup to the sundown
Every Monday to the weekend
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
I am, I am, I am
From when the ball's up till the ball drop
From the sunup to the sundown
Every Monday to the weekend
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am

[Verse 1: Shane Reis]
Some would say I haven't made shit, I haven't been anywhere
But a lot has changed since I was cool with the fade, without any hair
I used to do a show and get plenty stares
I was climbin' and must've slipped inside of they mind
'Cause now they understand without any chairs
I been doing this shit here for many years
I only got a few in the crew
But my fam come through if there's Henny there
I used to be a man made of many fears
Now I breeze through without any care
Before B Rabbit had his clothes in a Glad bag by the trash bin
I could see me without any mirrors
You thinkin' it's a race, I'm already there, skrt, I'm already there
What? You don't know what I'm made of
You haven't heard a wack verse from me on a record
In years, or ever if you stay up
Insomniac for all the salty cats
I'm moving like I'm in the way of somethin'
I commute and just cool and not sayin' nothin'
Shout out to George for the beat, working
Feeling like my feet ain't left the floor in a week

[Hook: Shane Reis]
When the ball's up till the ball drop
From the sunup to the sundown
Every Monday to the weekend
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
I am, I am, I am
From the ball's up till the ball drop
From the sunup to the sundown
Every Monday to the weekend
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am

[Verse 2: Spose]
I always stayed up late, way before I had kids
So now that I gotta feed 'em breakfast every morning
Man, I barely even know my eyelids
They said that too much sleep get you a pass to Hell
So when I fall asleep, better catch myself
I gotta be the one, like after twelve
Till they put a statue of my ass in Wells
No rest for the wicked (Rest for the wicked)
I'm wicked good, I admit it
People talk about it, fantasize about it, said they want it
I really went out there and did it
But I can't sleep when I lay in bed
I see a montage of my misgivings
I smoke too much, I drink too much
I think too much, I'm not just kidding
Got the TV on mute, while I compute
Flamethrower full of lyrics and an arson, blazin'
In the wee hours of the night, dark and shady
Around last call, up with Carson Daly
And in the mornin', I'm recordin' while they're snorin'
Really going for it, ah, sleep, maybe I should
In the dark of the night, shine bright
My window light the only thing in my neighborhood that's on
That's how it has to be to get cash for weeks
Till a masterpiece, till people ask for me
I gotta rap to beats, I got a lack of sleep
If it's 2 AM or 6 AM, I don't care, just call me up
Tryin' to get this income from insomnia
Bro, you know where we're goin' in

Who's going in without sleeping? I am

Every Monday to the weekend
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
Who's going in without sleeping? I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am

[Verse 3: Shane Reis]
I see the sun peakin', 'bout to start the mornin'
I done the evenin', that's one of the reasons
When I come in [?], if you wonder who he is
I am, I am, I am, I am
I get down like there's shooters here
I feel like I ain't answer the [?]
I had to unlace 'em, get my boots some air
I went and grew some hair and dropped a few [?]
And now I am 'round here, like Questlove's do
I'm on now and I'm next up too
I got zero space in my schedule
Man, I'm doing me, I'ma wake alone
So I don't know about the rest of you
I'm guessing you should do what's best for you
Instead of saying you'd do it but then never do
I'm up when the red light's blinkin'
Too many thoughts in my head, I'm thinkin'
I was on the road, by the time you got home
I'll be back while you taking a nap, so let it sink in
In a small amount of time, I get a lot of it
Even if I made a minimal in profit
I'm in there like [?] at the INS, I'd probably die for a rest
