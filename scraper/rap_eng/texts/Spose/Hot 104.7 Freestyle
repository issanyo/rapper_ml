[Verse]
Best rapper ever from New England, yeah, probably
Any hating on my reputation, that's mythology
Every Spizzle bar chiseled art from mahogany
I'm back, so everybody's F'd like misogyny
Another mom dies from prescription dope
Lecture from secture, my description's "woke," get 'em bro
If you hate my style, you're in denial like Egyptian boats
I'm ready to go
Man, in the last year I made three albums and an app
While I raised four kids, did recycling and the trash
This goes out to everyone who doubted in the past
Spose is back, everybody else who flows is wack
It's the preeminent bro, weathered the ebb and the flow
In 2-0-7 to go, his hoodie is heavy with smoke
Steadied the boat, even when levees are broke
Ew, the president's gross, I'm representing the folk
And I got a big agenda so let's get started
You're from the suburbs, but you claim you live downtown
People hating 'bout the plays on their SoundCloud
People talking 'bout a song that they're gonna drop
A teaser for a teaser, I can't wait, when's it gonna stop?
Bababababa, weird but likable
I'm from Maine, my whip got a beard made of icicles
And when it melt, Bean boot hit the puddle
Just another nobody tryin' to pop like trouble
Barbarian American, character is iffy
Moves fishy like aquariums, 'plicit in distributin'
War to your area, blown to bacteria
Drone bomb, your home gone, Iraq to Raqqa, Syria
My tax money pay for that, I might go Libertarian
Spose all over your, uh, face and hair again
My rhymes save lives like humanitarian
Your rhyme make people touch pause like veterinarians
Hey, "one, two," said a cop, "three"
Found a murder weapon in his hand, he's like, "It's not me!"
You wanna stop me? Get a less hot beat
I made a couple hundred grand and they told me that talk's cheap
Bro, so be careful who you listen to
I know who you pretend to be, I know that it isn't you
Man, the conditions that they're living through
Make 'em wanna get a gun and drop white like pigeon poop
Good Luck With Your Life, I'm excited
KingofMaine.com, don't fight it
The competition coming for me, I'm delighted
'Cause I'll leave it looking like they took a flight on United
Ay, Spose and Krissy and Ryan Deelon
And the mics be on, so I'm here
Good Luck With Your Life, May 5th
KingofMaine.com, Spizzy Spose
