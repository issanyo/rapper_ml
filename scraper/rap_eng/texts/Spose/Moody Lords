{Verse One: Sarah Violette]

Where were you back then
When I was rapping in the attic with these two masked men
Isolation and depression tryna move back in
But O*zee and Shane saved me, man I knew that then
Then some news from the neighborhood had blew back in
Spizzy Spose got a deal, thats in 2-0-10 (2010)
Now the country's looking at us through a new old lens
I know the contradictions heavy bring a U-Haul in
Cause we was dope before you, and you walked in
And thought that you would give us kudos with that pseudo grin
Now my teams even colder than like Pluto is
But yo you said we couldn't do it what did you know kid? Huh? Shhh
Take a second to a mourn
I gotta change my whole aura fore I step in the storm
Cause I could do anything but baby never the norm
Get out of bed in the morn, and leave you dead or unborn
Because my sound waves left you with your head all deformed
That's why when I perform, your fucking helmet is worn
That's protection for you homie, I can tell that it's warm
Cause when I spit for like a minute I'm the devil with horns, ahhh
You don't really even want that, I flaunt that
And burn your whole face whenever you get in contact
Bomb strapped in the center of the stage
I never meant to do it but it happens everyday, okay

[Hook: Sarah Violette]

You know all that I know
Youve seen all that Ive seen
From the beginning weve been winning
Man thats just our team

[Verse two: Spose]

But where were you at mang?
I drop my first album and then D-Day came
Step out my car, raised the bar that CD: "Pdank"
Back when rap night was hosted by DJ Shade
Took guys by surprise "ooo hehe" play games
I was the only one driven so that became fame
And then fellas got jealous and they became lame
And everybody switched their style up we ain’t change
I still rip rapper to pieces to push the product to purchase
And peace in priuses with positive persons
I give props to the pop filter
Stop you cannot kill a deity
We let you live in this world that Gods built up
Man fuck your posse
We set the blueprint for you cats to copy
Tryna smash cats back on their ass, it’s hockey
You’d need to cloned me in a celtics hat to stop me
See me counting money after kicking a flow
Even though Im brought up modest Ive been given to boast
Lames think my names not forbidden to spoke
Every other rapper in maine need a kick in the throat
Hold up gotta give respect to ghost
Cause he had turned me onto Sarah
Told me Sarah was dope
And the same with Shane
So when we’re saying Pdank
Even though we’re not close
I give ghost a toast
Man the competition and their writtens tryna connect
And theyre probably perplexed why ain't respond to the text
But I know they’re quitters gone this winter or next
They’re probably bitter that their shit is not considered a threat
Pdank here forever
Like the rivers and streams
Born to reformed nightmares
Deliver the dreams
We remain shining
Rhyming peep the shimmer and sheen
To fuck with my team
You’d need a time machine, you little bitch


Can I say that?
