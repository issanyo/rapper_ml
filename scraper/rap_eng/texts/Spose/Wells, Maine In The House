We Smoked It All (We Smoked It All!)

[Verse 1: Spose]
I'm coming straight outta Wells
A paranoid nerd named Spose
My parents still annoyed I live high, aim low
Feel the wind blow right out your gazebo
But it isn't Wheel of Fortune when I'd like to buy an "O" (OOO)
Bills reach to the tree tips
If we do a remix, by then mine might reach to an eclipse
Peep this, I'll be out lurking by the beach
Backwoods packed good, pack five dollars a piece
Bob Marley out the Bose and the windows
Gramps bitchin' from a distance cause he knows it's Spose
Oh, up to my usual nonsense
Arm's reach, car seat: beautiful contents
Wrist not on freeze though it's six degrees
Sixty rappers aren't as dope as three fifths of me
Bro, I don't let fools get to me
Son, I was high before "U" like twisted "T"s
And I'm happy to be back in the game
Sometimes I'm feeling so chipper I smirk (Why's that?)
Cause being the best rapper in Maine?
That's kind of like being the best stripper at church

[Chrous: Spose and Cam Groves]
Cam Groves make ya jump, jump
Spizzy Spose make ya jump, jump
Wells, Maine make ya jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
We smoked it all!

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
Yo, I been nice since head lice Fisher Price mics
BMX bikes and "Wanna be like Mike" (Like Mike?)
That's right, I'm 24 somehow
The same age that Big was when he gunned down
Now looking back I'm dumbfounded
'Cause rap's full of cooking crack and gun sounds
You can find me rolling down a side street
Five-deep, whip made in the early 90s
Cops behind me, crazy world to steer through
As I fear the blue lights flashing in my rear view
So here's to every single set played
It's been a decade since recording on cassette tapes
This is for my people that are trying to get they debts paid
Girls in the front, to the dudes trying to get laid
See the truth is, your brain's a muscle - use it
Call us iTunes on the way we hustle music

[Verse 3: Cam Groves + Spose]
Coming straight outta Wells, skinny dude, bro named Cam Groves
Rototiller flow, I give a fuck about a damn ho
And he's not talking about some garden tools, pants low
Get it rolled before the show, chillin' at the transpo
Been repping the M-E since peddling ten-speeds
And battling emcees when clubs were chem-free
Wendy's, high dudes, drive-thrus
Empty eight High Lifes then wake up to the NBA highlights
Five mics, hold up rhymes that I throw out
No doubt, make like paint and roll out
Spose sold out locally, vocally
I can admit I'm the shit, aw, quick, get the potpourri
I'm not a dope dealer, just a dope emcee
Well, I used to sell weed just to smoke for free
So open me a Michelob and openly I'll kick a flow
And hopefully somebody brought a blunt
