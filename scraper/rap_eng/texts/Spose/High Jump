[Verse 1: Cam Groves]
If this is called life I'm doing alright
Spose, Cam Groves baby We Smoked It All twice
Yeah we back and in fact we missed y'all
In the lab, making hits, sorry 'bout the withdrawals

And you can say that we're killing it hard
You can find We Smoked It All 1 still in your car
I be reading on the Phoenix man we still on the charts
So name a label up in Maine that be iller than ours

Who you know make hits straight back to back
P dank, we're the shit. Where your bathroom at?
Got pop rap flipped like an acrobat
Cam Groves flow fresher than a vacuum pack

Still eating on that fast food, drinking on that Pabst Blue
Only difference is now Cam is making cash too
I'm talking ass, booze, bitches on my junk
Now we're setting bars making motherfuckers high jump

[Verse 2: Spose]
Well look who the fuck just stumbled into Subway
Now I can afford it, drop my phone on the floor
"Is that Spose?" "Yeah it must be"
Damn straight pimpin', about a year older
Since that record from We Smoked It All 1 went golden

Swagger of a cripple, P Dank owner
Doing shows with those I used to scribble on my folders
Downloads tally from Cali to Minnesota
And in Maine I hold it down like I'm peeing with a boner

You must've taken Ambien, sleeping on my rhymes
When I sold more than Yelawolf and Mac Miller combined
It's fine. I did it all without a blogpost
Been behind bars for years but I've never dropped the soap

Labels want singles like match.com
I'd rather not exist like fat hot moms
There's more to life than weed and rap music
But we smoked it all again so you know we had to do it

Spose, Groves
P dank in this motherfucker
Slim pickens Peter Sparker
Back, volume 2
