She just wanna party
Never saying sorry
Feel it in her body
Look at what she started
So she just wanna party ('cause it never feel wrong)
('til the money's all gone, she ain't) never saying sorry
(What the hell the world coming to?)
(Where kids are in the other room, she) feel it in her body
(She drop it to the floor, DHS is at the door)
(Would ya) look at what she started
(It was all fun and games, now they yelling out her name)
(Because) she just wanna

Now I used to work with this girl, Jenny
Chugging Henny, every night she got lit like charcoal
We smoked, did coke, I stopped, I got old
But Jenny stayed doing lines like a bar code
She sniffed white, veins blue, blood red, so American
Don't we all wanna stay kids?
She never grew up, late twenties, looking forty
Heroin can make you age real quick
Her boyfriend had darted, didn't wanna catch her charges
She was laying there, convulsin', overdosin' on the carpet
As her daughter's cryin', mother's dyin', Beatles playin'
Needles layin' off to the side like a garnish
Heard she entered rehab and she got a job at Target
But the Devil wanna finish what he started
He built a stairway to Heaven from the bed of her apartment
Went from beautiful to funeral, 'cause she just wanna
Dance with the Devil
'til he take her to a nice little cabin in the valley
Saw her at the season premiere
It's too bad, I'm turned up at the season finale
Add another number to the tally
'cause she could never say no
'cause she don't wanna quit
She don't wanna do some shit that she don't wanna do

[Verse 2]
Morgan was not in school on Monday
And her teacher already knew why
So when Morgan showed up there the following week
Her teacher gave her a hug, wow, she cried
She said, "Morgan, I saw it on the news...
I wish there was something I could do"
And Morgan said, "Thanks, maybe you could go bring my mom back
If you know God, could you put me in contact? Nevermind"
Morgan's only ten
But she feel the terror and despair so deep inside
Her peers could hear her holding back tears
All year when it was silent reading time
Thinking, "Mom, did you not know others can suffer
For the things you do? Now it's too late to discover
'cause your daughter's still here even though you can't love her
Did you know I'd be moving in with my grandmother
This year? Christmas here
You're the only thing on my list this year
I wrote it forty times on my letter to Santa
And I love my grandma, but it's just weird
Living here without you, would you please come back?"
That's what she thought as she's sitting in class
Holding back these tears, mom disappeared

She just wanna party
Never saying sorry
Feel it in her body
Look at what she started
So she just wanna party (Morgan's all grown up now)
(Don't give a fuck now, she) never saying sorry
(She's gone insane from all this pain)
(Wanna) feel it in her body
(Can't stop the cycle, dropped out of high school)
Look at what she started
(It was all fun and games, now they yelling out her name)
(Because) she just wanna
