I was in 12th grade when speakerboxxx dropped
Had a toyota corolla that i copped from the pops
About a week later, had my license lost
Cause i was driving bout 90 didn't see that cop
So my mom used to drive my whip to school
She was an ed tech had to get there too
So she left her cutlas at our place
She would take my car when she went on break
She came back one day with this really pissed motherfuckin look on her face
She said i found your weed
I hid that shit under your cds
You can't leave it right out in the open
Hoping wishing that you’ll never get caught smoking
And if youre that dumb then you’re going to jail
And you better not call me looking for bail

She said you better hide your drugs
The cops aren’t as cool as us
You better hide
You better hide

12 months later it was freshman year
I’m at the UNH dormatory we out here
We had all skipped class now jean full of beer
Cause we really didn't give a fuck about a career
We blazed weed all night
Spent my buddies work study money
On a backpack of keytone light
Heard the train tracks was a forest away
So we traipsed through the woods with lauren and kate
Laying on the tracks, on our backs
Bowls packed then its passed
Then its cracklin, repacked, we’d laugh
Lookin at the stars, looking in the void
It reminded me of pink floyd
Then I heard a big noise
Knew it was the pigs boy
Flashing with the light
And they grabbed me as I tried
To put the baggy in the nikes
That wasn't the last time I got caught man
If you want to hear the rest man just listen to god damn

She said you better hide your drugs
The cops aren’t as cool as us
You better hide
You better hide
