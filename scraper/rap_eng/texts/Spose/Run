[Verse 1]
Heyo, drop the blunt, jump the fence
Toss the lighter quick or that shit will become evidence
We'll get nabbed, thrown in detox
Cops rolling up, like joints
Stash the baggy in my Reeboks, zoinks!
Ghost's face red already, there's no sun
I'm winded too, man, but fuck it, we gotta run!
Deuce misdemeanors done took me to the cleaners
Cops is the meanest, Lorena Bobbitt off your penis
Run if you're black, or white like dandruff
Be scared of any motherfucker holding handcuffs
Pants sagging off my tushes, hop in the bushes
Too many brushes with the law got me hustling
Pushing my body to the physical max
'Cause I don't want to get charged with some criminal act
There's no peace living here with these police
I'm running down whole streets, fuck, I gotta go pee
Can't stop, I'll get arrested
Get locked up and go six months without (seeing my damn girl's breastses)
Run! You'd rather get cuffed, fingerprinted?
I'm sprinting like Homer Simpson with a doughnut in his vision
Run! Or be a big, bad faggot
In a jumpsuit the color of a Zigzag package, so

[Chorus: Spose, (Ghost), {Both}]
{Run!}
If the po-peezy in the shadows
{Run!}
(If you spot Fahey or Battle)
{Run!
Don't be dumb, cops are scum
They're handing out summonses by the tons
Run!}
If it meant he wouldn't get a trial
I bet even Biggie Smalls would a four-minute mile, so
{Run!}
Hop benches, jump over fences
When you see me coming, get the fuck out the entrance
{Run!}
Fuck that, I'm done, fuck that
Spose, motherfucker

[Ghost]
It's wacked-out Wednesday, the cops is in the rear-view
That's how it goes when Spose ain't got nowhere to steer to
Twenty-sacks to sell, I'm ballin' like Cassell
Taking shots of Grey Goose getting loose while I puff Ls
Weighing up these bags for fags that'll pay anything
Short 'em on a sack and these cats won't say anything
They ain't getting wise 'cause these guys will get choked out
Tried to get his money back, I smacked and then he broke out
Now I can't get rid of the smoke
But I know these cops won't catch us, this Barney 5 shit's a joke
Down shifting on 'em 'cause I got weed on me
Smelly, green bud without any seeds on me
Chasing like I'm big time, holding keys on me
But I gotta keep going 'cause they gaining speed on me
It's hard for me to slow down, I wanna see a new day
IMing my chick right quick from Mugs' two-way
Use my shoelaces as a belt so pants stay
If they catch me they gonna give me a fine that I can't pay
Now we bailing from the whip, Spose wants to try that
But I'm overweight so I'm looking for somewhere to hide at
But they mad close, they just wanna nab Ghost
Hope they don't pop off a shot or two
'Cause run's what I gotta do

[Chorus: Spose, (Ghost), {Both}]
{Run!}
If the po-peezy in the shadows
{Run!}
(If you spot Fahey or Battle)
{Run!
Don't be dumb, cops are scum
They're handing out summonses by the tons
Run!}
If it meant he wouldn't get a trial
I bet even Biggie Smalls would a four-minute mile, so
{Run!}
Hop benches, jump over fences
When you see me coming, get the fuck out the entrance
{Run!}
Fuck that, I'm done, fuck that
Spose, motherfucker
