I'm in love with the girl
Through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after
I'm in love with the girl
Through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after

[Verse 1: Spose]
Yeah I know I'm looking good when you're drunk
Blurred tits on my visage, looking sexy, huh?
If you saw me in the daylight you would probably jump
But currently, blurrily, I can see you're on my junk
And that's straight because I can tell you're out my league
You told me that you were a teacher, girl, I'm an emcee
Still living at my parents', age twenty-three
But you like me cause you heard me rock on many beats
But anyway, I hope you're down with me at daylight
I'm making omelettes and shit, you're gonna stay, right?
I mean it's cool for you to stay nights
But in the morning hope you see me in the same light
And don't freak like Gremlins
I wanna get you in the sheets like thread-counts
It's like we're voting in class when you put your head down
You won't remember what you said now
Said I was well-endowed, don't just be a pen pal, because

I'm in love with the girl
Through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after
I'm in love with the girl
Through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after

[Verse 2: Spose]
And, girl, I hope you like Sports Center, I watch it every morning
October to September, while I sip my Dunkin' Donuts coffee - milk only
I hope you like my homies
And I hope yours like me after they get to know me
I'm so glad you didn't jet like Joan
You stuck around like scotch tape and didn't go home
Maybe my morning breath makes you not want to go more in-depth
But you're still here, so I must not be boring yet
Girl, you're looking even hotter
Rocking my t-shirt from high school that says Wells Soccer
Other than that you're pretty nekkid
Lookin' through my DVDs like, "what is Empire Records?"
Only my favorite movie from sixth grade
I knew every word to that shit since '98
Maybe you could come over tonight after work
And we could watch it, and I'll try not to talk over all the words
Is that a plan?
