You start looking around, hearts racing, hands shaking, minds racing;
Happens to the best of us. After all, there's a lot to be worried about these days:
Earthquakes, tsunamis, Russians, ISIS, North Korea, ebola, riots, cops, black people, white people, Mexicans, communists, gays, Jews, not having enough followers, not having enough likes, not having enough stuff;
But if fear's got you down, I've got just the thing for you:

Fearless!
