[Verse 1: Luch]
I got a way with words, but you're a biter
Thought you got away with my words, but I'm the writer
Watch me as I blaze this herb, who got the lighter?
Whoever thought they were Bickin' didn't know I spit fire
Puff the magic dragon, yo, Spose take 'em higher
Cast-iron rhymers, we're solid emcees
They love to hate but still admire how we do this with ease
A calm breeze to a strong gust, you must be dreaming, Jack
Got a hundred and one ways for a phrase to bitch slap
Traps one in their yaps on tracks with this and that
You're barking like a dog, but showing pussy like a cat
Where's your flow at? Barely leaking like a faucet
My rhymes so tight that each word wears a corset
You forced it, used to be a stream now I'm a river
My raps would sound way better with this wrap, will you deliver?
Yeah check it now, a heavy hitter like Big Papi, you can't stop me
Cocky on beats like soundtracks to pornography
I don't promote violence on tracks like train wrecks
I'd rather catch these mic checks and sip a cold Becks
A heavy hitter like Big Papi, you can't stop me
Cocky on beats like soundtracks to pornography
I don't promote violence on tracks like train wrecks
I'd rather catch these mic checks and sip a cold Becks

[Chorus: Eliza]
These days we pay our dues to those respect within each crew
Signify our tries then look within each line I prove
Bring forth a new revelation of change
Sing for the love and the pain
At last, our courage remains
With heart, stay live, first thoughts with hands up high

[Verse 2: Spose]
Hands high
Go, go tell your drug supplier, bump Luch and Eliza
Who could deny the mood they inspire?
Some dudes drooling, just oozing saliva
Burn cruise smoother on a donut tire
Luch does the sermons and Eliza's the choir
Rapper say when (say when), Amen
I mean who's more religious than Spose is?
Cause when I rip a bong I move the water like Moses
Purest nonfiction in my jurisdiction
You conversed with hating persons if you heard different
Bro, we just wanna make more bucks
So we grind independently like skateboard trucks
And my scheme is Visene: a clear, new vision
A fresh attitude and a beer Blue Ribboned
Shh, rapper, we can hear you bitchin'
You're just mad our shit's rad and your shit isn't these days

[Chorus: Eliza]
These days we pay our dues to those respect within each crew
Signify our tries then look within each line I prove
Bring forth a new revelation of change
Sing for the love and the pain
At last, our courage remains
With heart, stay live, first thoughts with hands up high
