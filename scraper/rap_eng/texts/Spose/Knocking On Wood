[Hook]
Look, I don't got a mansion, I've never been to the Hamptons
It's more likely that you'd find me if you came up here and went camping
I got bills stacked up like Jenga, respected less than most singers
But you won't see me sulk about or wallow in self-doubt and let that linger
Look, I still haven't been killed, I got pills every time I got ill
I don't got mills to cop drop-tops or a house in the hills
But I won't feel sorry for myself
I don't need anything opulent as long as I've got oxygen
Know what I mean?!

[Chorus]
Tonight if you see me knocking on wood
That's just because I'm doing so fucking good
I don't hate my life, no, it's going alright
That's why tonight you see me knocking on wood

[Verse 1]
I got all my limbs, I don't got cancer, I'm superb
I never got kidnapped on my way to work
Got free education, bitch I'm learned
But some people aren't so lucky, knock on wood
I don't got HD TV but I got insulation
I got no Lamborghini's, but I got vaccinations
I got a microwave, I got some pocket change
And even if I didn't, dude, pssh, no complaints

[Chorus]
Tonight if you see me knocking on wood
That's just because I'm doing so fucking good
I don't hate my life, no, it's going alright
That's why tonight you see me knocking on wood

[Verse 2]
Peter Sparker back up in this bitch, it's on
It's a free country, I can say what the fuck I want
Shit, bitch, cunt, fuck the government, buy my songs
Some places, you say shit like that, you get your hands cut off
Lucky, aren't we? All this time to get drunk and party?
Puke up food while kids are starving? All of Somalia, not one Arby's
We're popping water bottles, we're getting tattooed
We're getting fat, taking naps, eating mad food

[Chorus]
Tonight if you see me knocking on wood
That's just because I'm doing so fucking good
I don't hate my life, no, it's going alright
That's why tonight you see me knocking on wood

[Hook]
I don't got a mansion, I've never been to the Hamptons
It's more likely that you'd find me if you came up here and went camping
I got bills stacked up like Jenga, respected less than most singers
But you won't see me sulk about or wallow in self-doubt and let that linger
Look, I still haven't been killed, I got pills every time I got ill
I don't got mills to cop drop-tops or a house in the hills
But I won't feel sorry for myself
I don't need anything opulent as long as I've got oxygen
Sing it!

[Chorus]
Tonight if you see me knocking on wood
That's just because I'm doing so fucking good
I don't hate my life, no, it's going alright
That's why tonight you see me knocking on wood
Tonight if you see me knocking on wood
That's just because I'm doing so fucking good
I don't hate my life, no, it's going alright
That's why tonight you see me knocking on wood
