[Verse]
Look, I know I just met you
But I wanna kidnap you so you don't meet the next dude
Or go back to your ex-dude, 'cause the stuff that you exude
I wanna bottle that up in a test tube
I gotta let you know that I'm broke
I've been in college for five years blowin' some smoke
And while you're swallowin' that
I've got to admit, I got no whip but I borrow my dadâ€™s
I got like eighty thousand in loans
Summers at my mom's, I'm livin' at home
And I'm workin' in the kitchen (kitchen)
One step up from the dudes doin' dishes (dishes, dishes)
I know I sound like a loser
But I'm smart with the arts and guitars and computers
In high school, I was twenty-fifth in my class
And if I wanted, I could've been higher than that
But I was in the parkin' lot gettin' high in the back
Beers cracked, words spat, tryin' to rap
I kinda understand why you're cryin', in fact
I guess I would cry too if I was you
But for me you're an upgrade, what say we go through with it
For fuck's sake? You could make the cupcakes
On her first birthday, I could work Thursday to Thursday
I mean remember back at your place?
Then it's on the phone, yeah, tryin' to bone ya
Now we're gettin' grown, yeah, get the Cognac
Sorry, I'm just tryin' to lighten the mood
I can tighten my belt and get to lifin' with you
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson
I know I'm not the ballpark, tall dark, handsome you imagined
Mr. Magic Mike like dancin' in the pageant
But maybe I can try to mystify 'em with my rappin'
We're just some novices in our early twenties
The test is positive, I haven't known you many
Moons, but on this fine night in June
We decided that we should let the seed just bloom (boom)
And maybe I can teach our kid 'bout MF Doom
