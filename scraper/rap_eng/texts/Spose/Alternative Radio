Haha, are we recording?

[Verse 1]
I was Six years old, in kindergarten
When my parents got divorced
It was the first time i heard the "C" word
Standing there on the porch
And then we all went back inside
We turned the radio way up high
We were hoping for some better times
Kurt Cobain said "Whatever, Nevermind"
We would listen to the...
I was Ten years old and I woke up for school and I made my bed
Around the time Billy Corgan wore silver pants and he shaved his head
Then, I heard them yell downstairs

[Verse 3]
I was Twenty-Four years old when I had the offspring of my own
I miss her when i'm out on tour
Singing interstate love-songs
So I call home on the phone she says "I miss you too"
I said "Loving is what i got" I said "Remember that"
It's a Bittersweet Symphony When you think of me
But in a few days I will be back and we can listen to the...

[Verse 4][Played under the hook]
I never quit getting lit like my own worst enemy
Eddie Vedder-y flannels til Iâ€™m seventy
And now i'm an aging fool, I played in school
But rage and tool made me cool it saved my...
