[Hook]
Ain't nobody broke as me, I'm all out of money
(I got no money, money)
Ain't nobody broke as me, I'm all out of money
(Got no money, money)
Ain't nobody broke as me, I'm all out of money
(I'm out of money, money)
Ain't nobody broke as me, I need all your money
(I need your money, money)

[Verse]
I get it (Bouncing), yeah, bouncin' them checks
Honestly, I'm at least a hundred thousand in debt
With the interest compoundin', it's astoundin', the threats
From collections, callin', textin', just infectin' my quest
Born into a game where the goal is the root of all evil
Though the people been deceived to think it's beautiful
Borrowed from my father and sister, I don't know who to call
Got harder, did a KickStarter, I got you involved
I pay the piper, buy the diapers, be a writer, man, I'll find the time
Can't afford an ounce and each account, it got a minus sign
Both of my debit cards got rejected when I tried to buy
Dinner for my fiancee, she looked at me with widened eyes
Worse is she pulled out her purse, looked to the side and sighed
Bet this shit don't happen to Jay Z, who I idolize
Sony/ATV my publisher, I write a rhyme
And they don't give a fuck if I eat lunch or if tonight I dine
Or if my daughter got warm water just to take a bath up in
If you bought my track and I wrote that then they want like half of it
Now I'm doing math and shit, zoned out in math class
Writing fat rap rhyme songs, behind thongs covering the ass crack
(Stay dreaming) Day dreaming, starring for a block or two
Forgotten the Pythagorean Theorem and hypotenuse
So though I'm good at verses and craftin' raps to fuck with you
It's hard to say which purchases I have earned tax deductible
There ain't nobody, to sprinkle me with sympathies
â€˜Cause frankly, they're angry, my occupation spittin' these
Symphonies, meanwhile, they're still working at Chick-A-Dees
Another jerk's logo on their work polo, wrinkly
Miserably, but they don't know how difficult this shit could be
And I don't got a lot, believe it or not, like Ripley's
What I earned from Universal, spent that all so quickly
Twenty percent to management, fifteen percent in hidden fees
The rest I reinvested in myself and helped the litany
Of people, Christy, Stiky, Ghost, Jay, Mike and McKenzie
Then I broke my back to pay the taxes, the epiphany
That that engagement ring I bring won't be no bling from Tiffany's

[Hook]
Ain't nobody broke as me, I'm all out of money
(I got no money, money)
Ain't nobody broke as me, I'm all out of money
(Got no money, money)
Ain't nobody broke as me, I'm all out of money
(I'm out of money, money)
Ain't nobody broke as me, I need all your money
(I need your money, money)

[Outro]
Money, money, all your money, money
I need your money, money, money
I need your money, money, money, money, money, money, money tonight
(Who we are?) The brokest motherfuckers on the planet
(And I am) So poor that I can't afford a sandwich
(Who we are?) Open wallets and we're yellin' "damn it!"
(And I am) So skinny, you might think that I'm famished
(Who we are?) The brokest motherfuckers on the planet
(And I am) So poor that I can't afford a sandwich
(Who we are?) Open wallets and we're yellin' "damn it!"
(And I am) So scrawny, you might think that I'm famished
(Who we are?) The brokest motherfuckers on the planet
(And I am) So poor that I can't afford a sandwich
(Who we are?) Open wallets and we're yellin' "damn it!"
(And I am) So skinny, you might think that I'm famished
I need your money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money tonight
I need your money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money tonight
I need your money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money tonight
I need your money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money tonight
I know this money doesn't love me
