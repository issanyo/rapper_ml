[Hook: unknown]
Why don't you go, go, go
We know you're amazin'
Clearly the greatest
I think you should go, go, go
So happy to know you
I wish they could clone you
Please, won't you go, go, go
And do us a favor
Don't ever have babies
Go fuck yourself

[Verse: Spose]
All the girls hate her 'cause she's so great
Dated pro skaters, never made a mistake
She is the one-upper, quick to tell a sucker
If he's badass that her little brother's still tougher
So when I told her that I just signed a deal
Now fans think I'm the man, while they interrupting meals
She replied, "Sweet, well I just cured AIDS
And I read a book backwards from the last page"
I said, "Holy shit, dude, that's crazy
Well I just had a baby, isn't that amazing?"
She's like, "Whatever, I tattooed my own back
When me and P. Diddy played phone tag
And what did you say, can you repeat it
I was thinking 'bout that time I went skydiving with Jesus"
Spare me the details, female, peace out
Back to the beach house

[Hook: unknown]
Why don't you go, go, go
We know you're amazin'
Clearly the greatest
I think you should go, go, go
So happy to know you
I wish they could clone you
Please, won't you go, go, go
And do us a favor
Don't ever have babies
Go fuck yourself

[Outro]
Go, go, go, go, go, go fuck yourself
Go, go, go, go, go, go fuck yourself
