[Intro: Spose]
Yeah
Dankonia
If you’re lookin’ for that
If you’re lookin’ for that
Yo, yo

[Verse: Spose]
Yo if you’re lookin’ for that ass shakin’, pussy poppin’
Panty droppin’, candy painted, gun totin’, gang bangin’ music
Then you got the wrong shit
This is a long list of ominous shit
I wrote to bong hits
After I went to [?]
I’ve seen dogs get kicked in domestic disputes
Over a hundred times that’s my estimate too
I know girls molested in youth by relative dudes
So, she despises guys lives forever confused
They say there’s a light at the end but she’ll never get through
‘Cause if you bend the stem you dismember the bloom
Black and Yellow might have faded but I remember the bruise
Hearts race like ethnicity when his temperament fumes
I remember tellin’ them I thought she disappeared like magic
Even though, I had seen her hidin’ in the attic
Kingdom tragic, no doubt but wasn’t the baddest
‘Cause I could make the decision which religion I practiced
Which facts to believe, which words I would say
And if I voted I could choose which dude is my candidate
Every girl that I knew had sex before marriage
And didn’t parish for being a dishonorable heiress to the family name
But that happens in other countries and I think that’s insane
So when we inevitably drop a bomb from a plane
I hope it kills the cruel rules to the game
And rewrites ‘em so we’re treated the same
Let’s go

[Outro: Spose & Kristina Kentigian]
I feel the battle’s just begun
Though we’re here, someday we will be gone
And I’m hopin’, wishin’, prayin’
To keep faith in you, you, you
