[Chorus: Stiky-1]
What if I told you that I wanna whoop that ass tonight?
Can you dig it?
‘Cause I wanna give it all to you
What if I told you I would give you all that shit that your girlfriends want? You can have it
‘Cause I'm hiding my love in you

[Verse 1: Spose]
I don't want to be too robust
But you know what? Girl, you don't suck
Plus, you read Harry Potter, I read Harry Potter
Let's go halves on a daughter, pretty sure that I could be a father
You heard the record so you know that I'm impoverished
Bank account negative a dollar, you cool with that?
I'm coming over
Got me buying Dentyne Ice and lint rollers
Plus you're pretty good at Jeopardy, and dumb girls are cool
But at Thanksgiving, I don't want 'em next to me
So I'm giving you the gravy, lady
Groovy, that we were both born in the 80's
Plus, my mom's all impressed ‘cause you're not retarded
Got your own car, own job, own apartment
Girl you must be tricked
I thought when you knew the deal you would leave me quick
But you got me saying:

[Chorus: Stiky-1]
What if I told you that I wanna whoop that ass tonight?
Can you dig it?
‘Cause I wanna give it all to you
What if I told you I would give you all that shit that your girlfriends want? You can have it
‘Cause I'm hiding my love in you

[Verse 2: Spose]
Girl, I like that you don't have AIDs
And that you cover the rent when I don't get paid
And the dinner that you simmer saute
Made it so I haven't been to Taco Bell in like days
You know I'm a fan of ya
Your booty make me wanna start a family up
Plus you like Coheed & Cambria
But you rap all the words to "Ante Up"
We'll be at our wedding, yelling "Kidnap that fool!"
I'm blazed so you let me take a nap, that's cool
Previous to you, it was all fast food
Sleeping on couches and shouting at rap dudes
I wouldn't put it past you to pass two Pabst Blues
Do some ass moves while I make it rain gas loot
In the meantime, I'll clean up this cat poop
Sing it Matthew

[Chorus: Stiky-1]
What if I told you that I wanna whoop that ass tonight?
Can you dig it?
‘Cause I wanna give it all to you
What if I told you I would give you all that shit that your girlfriends want? You can have it
‘Cause I'm hiding my love in you
What if I told you that I wanna fuck that ass tonight?
Can you dig it?
‘Cause I wanna give it all to you
What if I told you I would give you all that shit that your girlfriends want? You can have it
‘Cause I'm hiding my love in you
