Yo, this is: a fat white kid
Crip walking through a Wal-Mart eating a Twix
This is: his mom in the next aisle
Neglecting him while sending a text
This is: a mirror to society
I already seen the truth so you don't gotta lie to me
This is: a skull behind a smiley face
The dark side that we all try to hide away

[Verse 1]
Join me as we open on a heavy set bride as she cries on her wedding dress
Cheeks getting wet â€˜cause there's something she would never guess
Better yet, zoom in on the bride's maid
She fucked the groom five ways in the bride's drive way (No way)
Fast forward to the bride's suicide
I know a lot of sad adjectives and all of them apply
It's fucked up, because she suffered then she dies
But for this woman it was just tougher to be alive
If you rewind, you'll see that there were other issues
In her bedroom clutching on a chunk of tissues
At nine, got touched by her Uncle Mitchell
It's a cold world, darker than some pumpernickel
And I'm not tryin' to bum you out or make you sad
I just think somebody ought to state the facts
It's cool, they don't even hear half the raps
Working on their swag, let me tell you buddy:

[Verse 2]
The next scene opens in a parking lot outside an old motel
With the neon glowing as the rain drops fell
Both from the sky and the eyes of the passengers
Inside a ride that arrived, the inhabitants:
A mother and her three kids, runnin'
From a new husband who seemed to scream more than love 'em
Tonight, he said he'd burn the house down, kicked in the cupboard
They slipped out the back, undiscovered
She said they'd get a hotel room and a pizza
Watch TV, and take a breather
She went into the lobby and returned sick
She'd left her purse at the crib
Hair matted to her face as the rain poured
Her kids huddled with her, slithered to the back door
And I'm not kiddin'
He was sittin' in the kitchen, waiting to start hittin'

[Hook]
This is: what she won't say
When you ask "how's it going," the very next day
This is: her kids doing well
In school even though at home, life was Hell
This is: a mirror to society
I've already seen the truth, you don't gotta lie to me
This is: a skull behind a smiley face
The dark side that we all try to hide away
