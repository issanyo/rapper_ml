[Intro: Spose]
Only the strong survive out here, in Dankonia
Michael, Essence

[Hook]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
(And I'm a star)

[Verse 1: Spose]
Bro, you can't stand the heat
Better flee the kaboom, I smell the beef in the room
Soon as I reach the saloon I hear the floorboards creakin'
Stop speakin', I'm uniquely in tuned to how deceitful the goons
The deacon of the region reekin' of booze
Yeah, speakin' of whom, it's the freakin' buffoon
With my dialogue bleepin' in the Jeep in a dune
You fuck with Peter's platoon? We're never leavin' with a fever
Seen us seemin' immune, we bring the fire higher
But we're never breathin' the fumes, and you're moody
And it's fruitier than peaches and prunes
I was born and deformed by a beat with a boom
So swear allegiance to the legion of the chief of the boons
I'm a bald eagle, regal with the breeziness plume, and my beak is a loon
Silhouetted on the cheddar in the cheese of the moon
I was a heart beat in the womb, asleep and abloom
In a leafy lagoon, now I'm stepping out winged
When I breach the cocoon, like the demon of doom
Who gleam in the gloom to deepen the wound a deeper maroon
The evil balloons (Ayup, ayup)
Man, life's a bitch creepin' and she sleep with the groom
And we could all be in the dirt by a sweep of the broom
She might kill a million children 'bout as recent as noon
You think it's no fair? Oh, take a leak in the tomb
Just imagine the movements of humans with no food
They're lootin' and shootin' at students just to get to eat with a spoon
Till they're too weak to resume, with no feed to consume
The world is colder than a polar bear would even assume
So nowadays, I'm coming hotter than my semen in June
I toss the washcloth then I leave with a
And then I leave with a zoom
And reappear at The Grafton out in Hollywood
Interviews by the pool, you think I got it good?
(Ayup) Maybe I do
I show pressure to pipes, flows, guess I'm alike, Spose
Essence and Mike, with no question we be blessin' your life
A breath of delight, even without the Scope
I smoke the testament right, read more lines than 99 refs in a fight
I got the effortless type
Making contact like circles that's correctin' the site
Yeah, that's the shit I spit when was checkin' the mic

[Hook]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
(And I'm a star)

[Verse 2: Lady Essence]
Ayo I, I keep my focus on approachin' the beats
All my devotion, my emotion overloadin' in speech
My mind sharper than a archer and a Doberman's teeth
I'm letting go of the leash slowly exposing the weak
Divine start, I'm [?] on a solar retreat
In which the autumn doesn't follow my exposure to heat
I smoke a roach on the beach and watch for ocean police
I cum harder than a bowl of that [?]
Climax and IMAX is all over your seat, what I'm composing is deep
Watch the composure I keep
When all these bros come to my shows in hopes they flows can compete
I rip 'em open with explosives till they motion for peace
I cut some holes in the sheets
My soul frozen and I soaked it in bleach
That's why I'm colder than a ghost in the East, my style freeze
And best believe, I got these polars in fleece, deceased
Venomous words launching at ya, attack
The feminist [?] rapper is back
You sensitive nerve talking rappers, relax
I put a dent in you herbs talking that smack
I left and came back with grenades to invade rap, and I
Never toss it, I gloss it and redesigned it
Cropped it and redefined it, I lost it for me to find it
I talk on any topic you talkin' and I'm confidin'
You want it? Then I provide it, you park it then I'll align it, I mean
I been the dopest, they noticed when I was silent
When the dark was lookin' hopeless, my opus invoked the vibrance
Too cold to provoke these tyrants, I wrote with a bold defiance
Essence and Spose, you know that's a dope alliance
So if you see our CDs, then you should go and buy it
And if we're dyin', we ain't going quiet
And we ain't going quiet
(And we ain't going quiet)

[Hook]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
(Yeah, check it out, yo)

[Verse 3: Mike Be]
Yo, it's a small big globe, so don't blow past it
Missing the past won't mask it, hard facts made me a cold bastard
So tragic with words that were so lavish
As I threw the first fist full of dirt on my own casket
Shit, out of breath from the sprint
After consecutive stints, he had to check for the prints
Chasing checks will make executives wince
Flying high as a skyline, I shine and reflect in the tints
Read the message on the blimp, profession of exorcism
Executed on top of [?], a lot blessings with him
And just the [?] the breath will leave him fleshed out
[?] the type of referee stress now
[?] pace, is what I be before I leave the place
And breath easy because I seen the snakes
Rewindin' tapes, this a story in reverse, though
The glory and the curse, a core story from the first go

[Hook]
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
