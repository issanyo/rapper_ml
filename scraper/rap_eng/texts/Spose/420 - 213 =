[Intro: J.J. King & Spose]
Oh!
Woo! Smelling like a laboratory in here
J.J., Spizzy
Check us out, check this out, check this out
Check it!

[Verse 1: J.J. King]
We the type of dudes that come through, we light it up
Put you in the mood for hands up, go fill up your cups
No more fucking around now
It's time to talk about [?] up in these towns in Maine
We been hitting up your brain for [?], a couple minutes
When it comes to rocking the pocket, you know we in it
J.J. King and Spizzy been busy, making you cats look silly
Veteran flow, we rock shows, we tell 'em, really

[Verse 2: Spose]
Mic grippers, we're tight rappers with flow flippers
Vocab and persona, we're dope with it
We've been building while you've all been chillin'
We step on stage and make it hot just like your girlfriend isn't
Got it written in the kitchen, you're bitchin' and never rhymin'
We're clever when we designin', me and J.J. don't suck
So come to Maine and find us in the middle of a forest
Like a prude with a vagina, we be giving no fucks

[Verse 3: Spose & J.J. King]
Renowned around town for the way we speak
They're screaming when we're coming in like we were baby teeth
Been sinnin' since the beginnin' like I'm KGB
Don't got a TV but got ATVs
Please remain calm, put your mind at ease, psych
Look kid, I'm the Webster definition of high [?]
Maine, the royal team, spitting harder than steel
With rhymes that's more filling than five course meals

[Hook: Spose & J.J. King]
I mean, rhymes, we got plenty, come out and see
I mean, we're from the 420 minus 213!

[Verse 4: Spose & J.J. King]
We make it uncomfortable if your verbal is lame
We got the illest rhymes you ever heard out of Maine
We got the [?] rappers [?] P. Dank
Like we're armored in tanks, get out, your ship sank
Sank, sank, sank
Aw shit, it's history in the makin'
You've been waiting for this song for so long, I get impatient
Steady leisure, [?] my thoughts, I put it down on paper
[?] love it when I rock it, do myself a favor
Copped my first bag of trees and some tight [?]
I rock a 58 for sure to make the dope happen
Live where I'm most comfy, sleep on the stage
Blaze the [?] when they leave me amazed
We go arm's wide with black lines on 'em like Birch trees
Bong water, murky, beef jerky, and fur flees
We heard you and you're peeps blowing like 'kerchiefs
Your speech, made us say "PU" like a church seat (Ayup)
Think about it, embedded up in your gelatin (Ayup)
Drinking chowder with gentleman with the penmanship
We slay beats and hurl verses and then we light a doobie
And get loopy as girl cursive, you heard it!

[Hook: J.J. King & Spose]
Rhymes, we got plenty, come out and see
We're from the 420 minus 213!

[Outro: Spose & J.J. King]
We got some drum breaks, rad bros, done great, mad flows
P. Dank, cab fair, cat hair, lab coats
That's what's up, Spose and J.J., no doubt
Until next time, keep it classy, Maine, we out!
