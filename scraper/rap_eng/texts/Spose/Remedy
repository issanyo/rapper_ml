[Verse 1: J-Essential]
It's the lone poet, legend swooping down to your town
In my area, renowned, I said it and never forget it
Incredibly, cat's vocab, that's elementary
Limited word structure, blurred, with no intensity
The energy combined with sheer intelligence
These MC's metaphors, that's mere irrelevance
To the truth and topic, pop, lockin', fiber optic
Preaching without a prophet, profected my target
Aim, fire, shoot, like T Mc, I'm making your knees crack
Ease back (J), you're 'bout to seize that
Opportunity, the top, where we soon to be
All ya mothafuckin' haters might as well be on the moon to me
I'm on the map, and blaze a track rather foolishly
Setting off alarms in your dorm, so you knew it's me
Call the fire safety, hasty, never hazy
Clear vision of lately, no listening to "Crazy Maze"
Amongst a Maine phase that pays to play these
Wack tracks, like big hairbands in the Eighties
Well, I max that level of bomb, settled then gone
Compete for every prize, the medal and bronze
Stay up on a monumental status, rebel a song
What we do here is rap, heavy metal beyond
Undefinable, making unknown parts combinable
Creating what you got in your ear, and what I'm ridin' to

[Verse 2: Spose]
Well, I'm essential, like J, mad potential, mic slay
Preferential treatment from my speaking Peters by day
By night, like a lance, I'm enhanced without the silicone
I wrote an iller poem and gave my girl the D like Dilla's home
Shop at Hannaford, self-made, no manager
But money up and down like it's hands on the banister
Calls from unknown numbers, debts I'm paid, I'm not a Lannister
Dutch elixir sipper, cop a sixer of the canisters
Nobody sicker in my jurisdiction, I'm like royalty
Sick of paying taxes instead of rap and paying lawyer fees
When I was broke, they gave me nothing, now I'm paid, they spoil me
Funny how that works now that the people have anointed me
My hands dirt, logo on my damn shirt
On my dome, all caps like I hit "shift," like a standard
I'm the man, word, sentence, paragraph and chapter
I pray for peace then killed the show and care a basset after
I shop at Shaw's, I finish rockin' then the block applauds
Hit the doorbell, kick in the door until you knock it off
Fuck the rest, at best I think their quest is just forgettable
How they kept the dream alive so long, well, that's incredible
In the wrong pace in the long race, when the dawn breaks
See it on your aunt's face, even your mom hates
I could make a strong case that I been the truest
Rewind the track back and me and J could walk you thru it, yo
