[Mike V Voicemail]

Verse 1: Spose
It is he, who, two verses shows no mercy
Blazed always looking like I just ate turkey
In my life, no red dots, neither guns nor herpes
And the bong water's murky
I'll be perched at my mom's
Breaking up some mersh
Smelling like a marsh
Just got out of work
The state of Maine sustains temperatures far below 30
Girls nips get perky
It's regularly snowing
In the winter in a blizzard with the scissors and saliva cold as ice up in a Chrysler
We get higher than a Boeing
And as I inhale just know that in New Hampshire came close to jail but made bail
Now your sister feels me like braille
As I clutch a Sam Adams Boston Ale
Unshaven with a hoodie
Looking like an adulterer
Swerving out of Irving in a resin colored Altima
Altogether bimpin' and also I don't care
I smoke trees, ironically, the shirt reads D.A.R.E
It's like, "been there, done that"
Mud on the hubcaps, Wells, Maine getting ID'd for a blunt wrap

Chorus: Spose
Oh Woah Yeah
I take another blunt to the head
Yeah Yeah Woah

Verse 2: Spose
So rip the backwoods emblem as the blunt sesh assembling
In the summer bare arms like the second amendment
You can find me just hanging like an ornament
Snorting jagged little pills call em Alanis Morissette
Yo
We don't drive slow
Speed like Sandra Bullock avoid the Wells Po
In our parents' Tahoes
Kick it inconspicuous when gripping on the stickiest as we lurk the backroads
In garages dads blaze while playing Van Halen
I spent a lot of wages on being inebriated
T-shirt untucked, double-bubbler packed up
Proving thus: I been nuts since my bowl cut
We got sex but no pistols
Wells, Maine no bullets
Thick hickish accents sweatpants and mullets
The healthy and the wealthy eating salads with croutons
I'm microwaving Hot Pockets sleeping on the futon
Pass the grass, alas I don't care
I smoke trees ironically the shirt reads "D.A.R.E."
It's like "been there done that"
Blood, sweat, mud flaps
Drugs since I was watching Doug and the Rugrats

Chorus: Spose
Oh Woah Yeah
I take another blunt to the head
Yeah Yeah Woah
