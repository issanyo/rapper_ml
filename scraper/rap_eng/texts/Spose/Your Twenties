[Intro: Dave Gutter]
It's your turn, it's your turn at last
It's your turn, ain't no turning back
I know you see it, so go and get it
We believe in you (we believe)
We believe in you (we believe)
We believe in you (we believe)

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Welcome to your twenties, baby
I know you're gonna do amazing
All you gotta do is get it
All you gotta do is get it

[Verse 1: Spose]
So there I was, on the wooded path, mountainous horizon line
I'm drawn toward it so I sprint like the Verizon guy
I gotta get there, that's the whole point
Atop the mountain is a spinning gold coin
So I jog like memories, I ran like Tehran
I walked till my knees locked up like Akon
Till my feet sore like planes
But this mountain's feeling closer, this is gonna be my opus
Then one day up ahead, a door, it was red
As I approached the door, I felt the allure
I turned the handle, fell to a bed
The bed grew bigger, then burst
Then I fell, I landed softly on the Earth
Naked ladies came to save me, lift me up and then they bathed me
Saw a jaguar lapping up the honey out the basin
Then I shrunk and the ground turned to many twerking asses
I bounced around for hours, could've been nearly a thousand
I exploded into magic, cold water hit my visage
Now I'm back up in the forest with the mountains in the distance
The trail looks steep, and the mountains seem farther
The sun moved lower, and the grass got darker

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
Welcome to your twenties, baby
I know you're gonna do amazing
All you gotta do is get it

[Verse 2: Spose]
And then one morning on the path, on his back, in the black grass
I met an old man, named Dan, with cold hands
I asked if he needed help, he said, "No, you do"
I cry out, "what do you mean?", he replied, "The grass is green"
This guy is crazy, he yelled, "You have never been as high as me!"
Man this dude was weird, so I bounced like dryer sheets
Toward the mountain I navigate like Copernicus
Self-motivation, pep talks, that's my verbiage
I'd be there by now, but my journey been discourteous
So I still march like February 30th (oh shit)
But the red doors pepper my periphery
I try to avoid 'em like I do Jehovah Witnesses
But sometimes I slip, whoop! Banana peel go inside
Then return the panorama, feel so inclined
I'm getting near-towards maybe three-fourths
There's something I've never seen before, oh my god
What's that, a green door?
I got toward it, I could smell the appeal
I opened and I fell  into a verdure of field
A purple sky, blades of jade cater nines
Several emerald trees
I floated up, I'm flying on a dragonfly
Raindrops on droptop, I swerve around it
While the blue and red ones we hit from, they'll take you out
And see me riding on a giant dinosaur through local counties
Dropping several head of lettuce man, my pigment growing algae
All my friends are laughing, welcome to the jungle
I could stay in here forever 'cause it's shelter from the tundra
But I'm still not up the mountainside, doors start to multiply
Both directions magnetize, coin might be poltergeist
Start to wonder how can I? Clock is running out of time
Fear and doubt, they galvanize, demons all amalgamize
Came too far, I can't go back
No GUTS for this Agrocrag
Someone grabbed my back and tapped
It's Dan, he turned me round, I gasped
Sprawling valley below, I never noticed
Grey turned green as the scene blurred to focus
Autumnal colorways paint the acreage below us
Stretch into a shore where the forest turn to ocean
Felt a thawing of emotion, blacklight turned prism
The knot in my stomach untangled to a ribbon
I sat and the camera zoomed out till I'm nothing
See the coin twinkle like a gold moon up above him

[Bridge]
But we believe in you
We believe in you
No really, we believe in

[Outro: Dave Gutter & Spose]
Welcome to your twenties, baby
I know you're gonna do amazing
All you gotta do is get it
All you gotta do is get it
