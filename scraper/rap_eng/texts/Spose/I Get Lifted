[Mike Be]
P. Dank, motherfuckers
[Spose]
Mike Be!
[Mike Be]
P. Dank, motherfucker
Uh, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Mike Be]
It's the mister lick a star pro
Twisted at the bar, go split a cigar
And get lifted like cargo
Me and Spose, peers, smokin' for years
If this is a sport, we both go pro for careers
Now I keep a Q buried of green that's blueberry
Kept quarters under pillows [it's used?] no tooth fairy
Something to stash and glass it be in
Don't blow coke, but get lifted like cats that skiin'

[Chorus: Spose + *Cam Groves*)
(I get lifted) Mike Be, EA
(I get lifted) P. Dank, Cam
*They call him Cam and he's so low-key
But he don't do drugs, nah, he just smokes weed*
(I get lifted)
(I get lifted)
Yo, they call him Spose and he's so low-key
No, he don't do drugs, he just smokes weed

[Verse 2: Spose]
You could tell by the crystallized crumbs on my garment
Weed like an untended garden, bags like garbage
Backwoods wrapped around trees, like garland
Even when my funds were dwarven
Picking nugs out of the carpet
Misdemeanors assorted, but still I'm Pete Sparkin'
Yeah, come and take a gander and meander
At the name of what my label is
The alcohol and that are what enables him
I, I, I, I take the cheeba out the satchel, roll the weed up
And tobacco leaf, receive it, then I pass it briskly
If you're trying and you want to, but you're drier than a convent
I'ma tell you, sire, promptly, "bitch please!"
Shout out to anybody who has ever fronted me a bag
Broke me off a nug or let me smoke a drug upon their tab
Females or bros, you know Spose'll hit you back
I sign my emails "to the top" so you know that I

[Chorus: Spose + *Cam Groves*)
(I get lifted)
(I get lifted)
They call me Spose and I'm so low-key
'Cause I don't do the drugs, nah, I just smoke weed
(I get lifted)
(I get lifted)
*They call him Cam and he's so low-key
But he don't do drugs, nah, he just smokes weed*

[Verse 3: Cam Groves]
I smoked weed at fifteen, been stuck the same
Everyday I'm getting lifted like a truck in Maine
Never descend or plummet, I just spend my budget
A mile high, breaking up them Denver Nuggets
Some people tell me that I need to leave the house more
Find me chillin' inside, puffin' on that outdoor
So fuck your pot seeds, I just bought me
This big-ass bag of the snot-green botany
It's all chemistry, keep me steady remedy
If I forget your name, blame my short-term memory
I set flight when I hold the mic
With more hits than dank weed rolled up tight, right?
So put your flame to it, tired of the same music?
We gon' show you how the fuckin' people up in Maine do it
We smoked it all once, then we went and bought more
Ask me where I'm going and I'll tell you to the top floor

[Chorus: Spose)
(I get lifted) Yeah, Yeah
(I get lifted) Yeah, Yeah
EA, Spizzy Spose, Cam Groves, so low-key
'Cause we don't do the drugs, nah, we just smoke weed, uh
(I get lifted) P. Dank in it
(I get lifted) Blazin' it
My homie Jay Caron, yeah, he's so low-key
'Cause he don't do the drugs, nah, he just smokes weed, check

[Verse 4: Jay Caron]
Hey, yo, I'm getting lifted off them dank herbals before
I'm slangin' my verbals and I represent from Waterville, the horror show
We puff the purple, shit'll hurt ya, shit'll put ya right in a coma
Coughin' and chokin' while I'm jokin', soakin' up the aroma
Laughin' and gigglin', still puffin' that potent
Just for the smell of it, getting me open when it's important
Practicing rhetoric, the class, I stay ahead of it
Developing rhymes
And I don't need it, but I love it when in this state of mind, lifted

[Chorus: Spose)
(I get lifted) Uh
(I get lifted) Yeah, yeah
It's P. Dank, and we're so low-key
'Cause we don't do drugs, buddy, we just smoke weed, uh
(I get lifted)
(I get lifted) On and on and on and on

[Outro: Spose]
We just puff, puff, puff, puff, puff bud, uh
On that Erykah Badu shit
Yeah, spark one up with us, Peter Sparker, Slim Pickins
Don't even show up if you're not throwing down
EA, Mark Ross, I mean, look at- look at what
Look at what our record label's called
We Smoked It All Volume 2
