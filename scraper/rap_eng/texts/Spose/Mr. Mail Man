[Chorus: Amy Allen]
Look, I know your job is hard and you don't make much dough
I see you out there every day in the sleet and the snow
And every time I'm drivin' by, you're wavin', "hey-o, hello"
But there's one thing you should know

[Verse 1: Spose]
I wake up every day feelin' so successful
Another day gettin' paid, pushin' the pencil
Sun on my face, keurig in my cup
SportsCenter on TV, turn it up
Everything is pleasant, I'm livin' a bit of heaven
And it inevitably ends abruptly at eleven
That's when I hear his evilness
It's that piece of shit up in the eagle whip
That mail man, knew he came to ruin my life
I'm sure payin' bills what I'm doin' tonight
He's got the steerin' wheel on the British side
And every time I see him, I'm sad he didn't die
Six days a week, this dude's at my place
I try to be gone so I don't see his face
But the mail's waitin' for me when I do get home
Is it the bills for the phone or the student loans?
I can't wait, he's the nicest of folk
But I wanna put a knife in his throat
Brought me a letter sayin' my license revoked
You're a douche, I wanna find you while you're doin' your route
I wanna buy a deuce-deuce and put two in your boot
You make me wanna go psycho, postal, on you, you're my arch nemesis
And I don't feel bad 'cause I know you got benefits

[Chorus: Amy Allen]
Look, I know your job is hard and you don't make much dough
I see you out there every day in the sleet and the snow
And every time I'm drivin' by, you're wavin', "hey-o, hello"
But there's one thing you should know
Fuck you, Mr. Mail Man (hey!)
I don't wanna see you no more (no more)
Fuck you, Mr. Mail Man
And don't go knockin' at my door

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
Sorry, dude, I don't know what to say
Every envelope you give me, I just throw 'em away (trash)
I don't know why I take this shit
Knew I should've signed up for paperless
And I know that my bills be three weeks late
'cause of what you give me, I'm not sleepin' great
And you could probably find a job at equal pay
But I know you like to ruin other people's days
And I'm friends with the UPS man
'cause everything he gives me is somethin' I want
Next thing, guess who shows up, man (who?)
It's you with the bill for that somethin' I bought
You're the reason why I never, ever borrow or loan
Stay far from my home unless you're Karl Malone
And if I do say hi, it's a snarlin' tone
And if I gotta pay a bill, I'll just call on my phone and go

[Chorus: Amy Allen]
I know your job is hard and you don't make much dough
I see you out there every day in the sleet and the snow
And every time I'm drivin' by, you're wavin', "hey-o, hello"
But there's one thing you should know
Fuck you, Mr. Mail Man (hey!)
I don't wanna see you no more (no more)
Fuck you, Mr. Mail Man
And don't go knockin' at my door
