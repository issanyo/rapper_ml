[Intro]
Uh oh oh hey I didn't see you there
Welcome to sunny Wells, Maine
Pass me the blunt
(yeah I got a boner, bitch)

[Verse 1]
Back when I was sipping Sunny D
Watching "Harry and the Hendersons"
Oshkosh jeans, and the Dimetapp medicine
Life was good and oh so simple
No girls, no weed, no police, no pimples
And now it's Red Stripe 'til I can't stand up
I don't bluff, I'm in Maine like horse dandruff
I could burn my mouth and still not suck
With the bank account negative a million bucks
And even when I'm drunk I spit resilient stuff
And I date a Kennebunker who gives brilliant fucks
Similarly early life made me as such
Heyo what? I've been bonkers since Tonka trucks
Is he Spizzy? is he nuts? The locals are unsure
No fur, just ash stains on the sweatshirt
Who besides Spose had a flow so pure
Before the Red Sox reversed that curse in '04, baby

[Chorus]
Fuck it
If you're with me or you just got meds for your STDs say
Fuck it
One life to live and one million more nose rips to give say
Fuck it
If you ain't got paid or you ain't got laid in one hundred days say
Fuck it
Spizzy Spose, you're damn right, I keep it bimpin'

[Verse 2]
White dude, Nikes
Suburban living where the blunts half-pipes be
Quite abundant, night life unlively
Glove compartment got Febreze and Visine
VCR-TV combo not widescreen
And Mike V hustles trees unidly
12 year olds fake IDs
Rich dads keep their yards tidy
Shall I proceed? (mmhmm) alrighty
We got wealth disproportionate
Teen suicide, no need for Kevorkian
Dope people mixed with should've-been-abortioned kids
Wells, Maine from the casket to the orphanage
And back again, I'm from the place where the wives scream
Redneck fists aren't soft like Ice Cream
Police lights shine bright white
Every night like Jesus Christ light beams
And the radio sucks, so turn up the Outkast

[Chorus]
Fuck it
If you're with me or you just got meds for your STDs say
Fuck it
One life to live and one million more nose rips to give say
Fuck it
If you ain't got paid or you ain't got laid in one hundred days say
Fuck it
Spizzy Spose, you're damn right, I keep it bimpin'

[Verse 3]
I've been dope with these rants
Since everybody rocked JNCO pants
Justin, JC, and Lance used to blare
At every Junior High Dance
While my mom was in the basement watering plants
With the xenon lights, rural life ain't polite
Welcome to the jungle, stash the weed by the grundle
My buddy mumbles that the cop probably knows his uncle
Get it dropped like a fumble
I said, "that shit's bimpin'"
5'8" eyes dilate when I'm baked
Guidos in tuxedos buy steaks at high rates
For Christ sake, American parents are irate
Cause they've all seen their daughters gyrate on Myspace
I'm on the couch, passed out, being an ass clown
But they say that Spose kid is dope with his mouth
In fact the illest illestest since social studies syllabus
Before Islamic militants were killing us

[Chorus]
Fuck it
If you're with me or you just got meds for your STDs say
Fuck it
One life to live and one million more nose rips to give say
Fuck it
If you ain't got paid or you ain't got laid in one hundred days say
Fuck it
Spizzy Spose, you're damn right, I keep it bimpin'

[Outro]
Can't afford a hat, I wear a bucket
Kicked out my mom's house, fuck it
On the mic I used to be sucking, reluctant
But not no more
Fucked a lot of girls, but not no whores
Freestyle, used to kick it F4
I can kick it up in my mom's door
At my dad's house, I got a bad mouth
From the Wells, Maine area
Sicker than malaria
Cause mass hysteria in your area
Fucking coming out your stereo
When you're bumpin'
I mean something like that, bimpin'
