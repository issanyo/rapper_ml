[Verse 1]
Listen up Bub, I'm from Maine, where ain't nobody famous
Where people move away, and some of 'em don't even claim it
Where Canadians vacation, tip bad, get hated by the waiters
Where some people are dating even though they are related
I'm Spizzy Spose, one of Maine's own
I slanged lobster roles before I became grown
Now my name's known, had jet planes flown out to LA
Then what did I do? I came home
Pinecone aroma, in the Atlantic
It's not the Bay State or the state made of granite
But where I first rapped, way back on my planet
My whole state behind me still, I'm Kevin Mannix
These local cats didn't think that I would blow
They must not have been to my shows, and my little bros
They didn't think, "The kid, he could flow"
Now I look like a man, like Olympia Snowe

[Hook]
So throw your hands in the air
If you can't get there from here
If you sip Shipyards and like when I spit bars
Everybody let me hear you say, "Oh yeah-yer!"
So throw your hands in the air
If you can't get there from here
If you sip Shipyards and like when I spit bars
Everybody let me hear you say, "Oh yeah-yer!"

[Verse 2]
I'm from a place called Wells, where snow balls fell
Where traffic gets stalled later when it all melts
In the booth, broke loose like all Hell
It's all swell, rum punches with Rob Caldwell
And you could tell Augusta that I called to say
The following: "Fuck Paul LePage"
There's no way he can be from where we've all been raised
He needs to shut his fat face and lick the balls for days
While I'm robbin' every Marden's till we all get paid
If that clown isn't hauled away
Bound and drowned up in the Maine Mall in hollandaise
For trying to turn Maine into the Balkan States
I'm, Governor Spose, I deliver the noise
But not like Susan Collins with a quivering voice
I got a boisterous mouth, the rap game Portland Press Herald
In flannel apparel in the oyster house
Where strippers with few teeth drop it lower than the murder rate
Where the old people salty like a surfer face
If a loud sound in their town reverberates
I'm from where Angus King isn't a burger place
We're all looking like the opposite of fashion week
Nobody to impress but the faculty at Applebee's
So if it happened on the runway, we're the last to see
And actually, we don't need fresh clothes to live happily
We keep it basic, man, in Vacationland
Where all pretty lakes still got snakes in them
Single mothers discover it's not Utopian
From Fort Kent to Brunswick, where Bowdoin is
Now she's losing hope again, she let another insecure dude into the Fallopians
Screams not melodious, bruised, laying there on the linoleum
The type of wounds that are not muted by Imodium
The local representative she voted in
Sugar coated it, gloated and bloated at the podium
The promise is erroneous, now she and her kids are in the cold again
Shivering, she's holding 'em, that's what you see
You take a look behind the foliage and see the real Maine
It's not lobster dinners everywhere, we feel pain
I'm just saying what I see around me, where they found me
In Maine, put 'em up for the sixteen counties

[Hook]
So throw your hands in the air
If you can't get there from here
If you sip ship yards and like when I spit bars
Everybody let me hear you say, "Oh yeah!"
So throw your hands in the air
If you can't get there from here
If you sip ship yards and like when I spit bars
Everybody let me hear you say, "Oh yeah!"
