(Spose)

Show don't tell
They’ll never say way to go, they'll just say go to hell
Never ever let your cranium swole
You’ve got to keep your ego, under control
I know even though you think you got that heroin crack shit
Don’t act it, that's wackness, put in practice
Let your rhymes speak, bragging about a dime piece
Or time piece child please be sensible
‘cause lying's indefensible
Bullshit’s detectable
We all got noses
Even if what you admit is reprehensible
You will be respectable just because you told it
I'll never say protect your neck
‘cause truthfully I’m more Beck than Inspectah Deck
You've got to come original on your etch-a-sketch
Or get shaken up then left next to death
In other words if you wanna be a folk hero
And they're all selling lemonade, sell Coke Zero
Do something different, when you rap stuff
And hold on, prepare to blast off
But don't get gassed up like electric cars, or be after last call spitting empty bars
Because anyone who has time to envy ours is probably all talk like NPR
If you burned all your bridges, shit is looking destitute
Dig tunnels to exit through, don't think with testicles
If you want your homey dead, keep him texting you
Keep your friends near, keep your foes right next to you
I'll tell you what Jay-Z told me
“Hoes will get you sidetracked then clapped from close feet”
Distracted from tasks by ass i know it's tight
But you could lose money, time, even your life
Plus bitches are crazy......moving on
I hate political rappers more than I do Lebron
I've been a Celtics fan for super long
So keep Chechnian rebels out of your stupid songs
Go be a columnist, go be a novelist
Like a rap a song is a solution to all of it
Yeah Obama's heard of Common but I doubt Michelle Bachmann has got Pac in her Walkman
It's Sarah McLachlan

Sarah McLachlan
Sarah McLachlan
It’s Paula Cole and Sarah McLachlan
It’s Edwin McCain and Sarah McLachlan
It’s Joan Osbourne and Sarah McLachlan
It’s Joan Osbourne and Sarah McLachlan
Sarah McLachlan
It’s fucking Paula Cole and Sarah McLachlan

(spoken, with echoes)
The sea living, beautiful and life giving, seems as you ride to be everywhere about you
Behind, before, around
Now it rises like a lake, gemmed with islands and embosomed with rich swells of woodlands, now you catch a peep of it with your right hand among tufts of oak and maple, and along it spreads on your left to a majestic sheet of silver among rocky shores hung with dark pines, hemlocks, and spruces
Harriet Beecher Stowe, Letter from Maine 1852
