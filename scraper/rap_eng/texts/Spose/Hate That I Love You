[Verse: Spose]
Look, I spent my last seven hundred bucks
Trying to make a future for us
I thought it'd make you like me better
I stayed nights and days, and skipping triple-keggers
While my friends were ragin' at work, I was missin'
They were flirtin' in the kitchen
I was in the stairwell sittin'
Starin' at my hands, mumbling to myself
"Man, Spose has lost it! I think he needs help"
I tried to prove I was devoted, whether sober or loaded
Gave you my brain 'till my voice was wheezy as Lil' Wayne
It's lame, you won't give me nothing in exchange
And it's strange cause you act like you don't know my name

[Sample: Jasmine Villegas]
And how I hate that I love, I hate that I love you
I know you're unfaithful, I know you're unfaithful
Hate that I love, I hate that I love you
But why can't I leave you?
Hate that I love you

If I had another car
For every time you broke my heart
I would be a rich girl now
I could buy me anything, but I'd still cry
And if I had a dollar bill
Pay for all of my good will
I would be a rich girl now
For every time you broke my heart
Sorry, Sorry
You keep on telling me sorry, sorry
But baby, now I know the story, story
You keep on telling me sorry, sorry

[Interruption: Spose]
Aaaannd that's enough of that shit
