[Verse 1 : Spose ]

Meet me where you met me before
I haven't left (Nope!)
Shit I must've jerked off Jesus
Cause I'm so blessed (Oh my God!)
I guess it's that bro
S-P-I Double Z, Y, Spose
Dawg, I'm the cat that they aimed at
Back, Hoodie Plain Black
Bowl packed
So religiously go get the stained glass
Spitter of the best raps, never claimed that
But I could've, down to earth like a plane crash
And all the gangster rappers want me dead
The artsy rappers want me dead from a zombie plague
Been the topic of conversation
Debatin' my fate while I'm wakin' and bakin' and makin' fucking bacon and eggs
They're playing catch up (look at em!)
I relish what the haters say
I must heard different when I heard my first record play (I'm Awesome.)
Twist pencils with my tongue over 808s
That make you thought the cops just showed you how a taser tastes
Doing good (Doing good)
Rhyme great (Rhyme great)
So not hood (hood)
Pine tree state
Yeah I used to skate
But could barely even ollie
So I stuck to ridin' trolleys
Looking jolly in the face
This is Spose

[Chorus : Space vs Speed]
I feel summer springing in
And you've got taste for finer things
Restless, Winters, Fall, Away
Come with me and come with me
We'll try again some other day
You've just, watched us, Fall Away

Make yourself indispensable
Find yourself Into Spose

[Verse 2 : Spose]
I kick what's happenin'
The rest just kick their own asses
Like Jacqueline (You guys all look stoned)
Spose must be back again
No I don't want to meet your rapper friends
If you thought the action stalled
I'm back in-volved
I'm on the road, less traveled
[?]
I'm still in Maine
And ain't shit changed
Except the diaper on the baby bearing my name
All the same, I just like to be the nicest
Not let my vices decide what my life is
Till everybody's heard of me
And got plots to murder me
Each song sung true and bumps like maternity
I'm 25 going on 8
I learn from mistakes
I got the songs that you bring along
Going on break
Til I can't be discerned from the greats
I could give a fuck if Lindsay Lohan lost weight
A lot of dudes hate
Then try to jump on my tube stake
They're like Gary Coleman
Too little too late
I'm well read from a blue state
People really listening are like
Tou-fucking-ch√©

[Chorus : Space vs Speed] (2x)
I feel summer springing in
And you've got taste for finer things
Restless, Winters, Fall, Away
Come with me and come with me
We'll try again some other day
You've just, watched us, Fall Away

Make yourself indispensable
Find yourself Into Spose
