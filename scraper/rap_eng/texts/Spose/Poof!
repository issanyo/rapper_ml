[Hook]
Do I not got you entertained?
Still not copying a thing
Still iced coffee in my veins, ooh
Still spot me at the bank
Still the god emcee of Maine
Still Preposterously Dank, ooh
PBR by the flute, find Ryan's pines lying my commute
'Til I got the LL Bean boots made of moose
Enough loot to get the roof on a coupe
And then make that shit go
Poof!

[Verse 1]
She make me wanna beat it like my adversaries
'Cause she got a butt big like it's my vocabulary
My shit sick as dysentery, you're the beneficiary
Tracks laid down like it's missionary
I fuck a beat up against the wall though
Your accomplishments hard to find like Waldo
I'm getting money that I wanted to get
Then the bills come like Monica's dress, it go poof!
Whoops, there goes the loot
Conversation, observation, still astute
Though I look aloof?
I'm a rebel, never settle, this is proof
I'm heavy metal when I'm pedaling the truth
I might have to pull a rabbit out the hat now
Something out of nothing that's my background
What I see like the middle of magician is cigars sawed in half like my lovely assistant
It go

[Hook]
Do I not got you entertained?
Still not copying a thing
Still iced coffee in my veins, ooh
Still spot me at the bank
Still the god emcee of Maine
Still Preposterously Dank, ooh
PBR by the flute, find Ryan's pines lying my commute
'Til I got the LL Bean boots made of moose
Enough loot to get the roof on a coupe
And then make that shit go
Poof!

[Verse 2]
I got your email but you know I'm not responding
'Cause I'm getting more-a-set these days, I call that shit Alanis
Fuck your team and every player on it
'Til I'm getting foreign green, I call that Isaiah Thomas
And fuck you even after that, every rapper's wack
Shit is foul, put you on the line, that's a hack-a-shack
You look up to me, because I'm like an acrobat
My peers disappear like they're zits with the Tazorac
Touch words like Vanna White, vanish in a week
I'm outlandish while I'm brandishing the speech
She got cancer so my grammy's weak
Might have to write my Grammy speech and read it to her 'case she's not here when I reach the canopy
I'll paddle into battle for people who can't fight
Bump me to my company saving your damn life
I'll sign paychecks 'til I need my hand iced
More W2s than the Irishman twice, oh yeah

[Hook]
Do I not got you entertained?
Still not copying a thing
Still iced coffee in my veins, ooh
Still spot me at the bank
Still the god emcee of Maine
Still Preposterously Dank, ooh
Bissell Brothers in the flute, find Ryan's pines lying my commute
'Til I got the LL Bean boots made of moose
Enough loot to get the roof on a coupe
And then make that shit go
Poof!
