[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen

[Verse]
In sixth grade I had blue hair, looking like Sonic
I guess even back then I was the oddest
Now I'm an artist, ducking from the audit
Nah, I'll still drink it if you don't got tonic
Don't tempt him, running from the gremlins
Home fortified like the Kremlin
Looking for cash and some tax exemptions
You've been looking for a writer tighter than that rectum
That's convenient, sleeping on him, keep dreamin'
I'll teach sheep to rap till the sleepers believe it
Dude in the Volcom jeans's a genius
Nice raps, fuck the spice rack, he's so seasoned
MCs creamin', no homo
All the chickens coming for the rings, no Frodo
Knuckles alfredo, rock a mic proper
I've been going hard in the paint, no Flocka
Lox on my bagel while my song's on cable
What I spit 'bout make me stick out like my nasal
I can't do it later, later
If I want the O's stacked up like a pack of Life Savers
Been pushing it, like my career's in labor
Always been a risk-taker for the paper
And when I get that I might cop a couple acres
And move in right next door to the haters
Unload the U-Haul, wave to the neighbors
You should Instagram it, that's a moment I could savor
Gotta get some better Chron, mics, I could get a palm
Pockets looking blimp so I'll bimp till the cheddar's gone
Get trophies and mantels to set 'em on
Have fun till it's undone like the sweater song
Ramble with assemblence of veterans
Assemblies are gathering, I'm rapping for the better man
My by-line next to all the rhymes that I'm pedaling
Influenced by the truest to do it, It should be evident
Came a long way since a young white man
Every night plan's detrimental to my life span
Now finally, I got my shit together
I match my shirt, and my kicks together
But that's vanity, I guess I'm vain, Maine Gretzky
Sicker than some liquor then I'll mix it with your Pepsi
S-P-O-S-E, rhyme sexy
You'll need a bigger clipboard than that to assess me
Hi, no yacht, I'm a landlubber
Sip a Sam's Summer with the cover band drummer
Peacock rappers, open up their trap
Those are dope feathers but you birds can't rap
And I've been going pretty fucking hard from the start
Peter beat the beat apart and leave it sobbing in the dark
Dankonia

[Hook]
Old school players and new school fools
Spose keep it jumping like kangaroos
Skew it on the barbie, we ain't tryin' to loose
They be like, "God damn it, they done changed the rules"
Old school players and new school fools
P. Dank keep it jumping like kangaroos
Skew it on the barbie, we ain't tryin' to loose
They be like, "God damn it, they done changed the rules"

[Outro]
(Ladies and Gentlemen!)
God damn it we done changed the rules
(This is my first time in Maine)
