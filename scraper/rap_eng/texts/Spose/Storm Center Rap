[Verse]
Yo, if it's a blizzard or a wintry mix
The only thing you need to know in Maine is simply this
Storm Center, there's nobody with more sweaters on TV
Where twenty degrees is warm weather (Burr!)
And if you wanna know if school's delayed
From Bangor to Bridgeton to Casco Bay
Then you oughtta tune in, we got the info
Peacock symbol, Togus in the window
So watch Kevin and Sharon and Lee
And Jackie in the jacket in the snow and the sleet
On Storm Center
