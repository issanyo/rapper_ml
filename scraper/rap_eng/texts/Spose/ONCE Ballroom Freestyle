[Verse]
Yo, I used to work a long day blazed
And wonder how I'd stay afloat like Kanye's stage
But then my tracks started spinning like a ballerina
So I woke up, got the Cheeba broke up like Brangelina
But then shit got sticky, that's kinda like Aunt Jemima
Had to scramble out the pocket like Cam from Carolina
Or Jacoby Brissett, you and your homies depressed
'Cause we the real deal and they're the phoniest yet
I had a buzz hard, like my dick in killer bee nest
I felt the burn but got lines like it's Hillary's neck
I'm thirty and I haven't stopped smokin'
I'm dumb, I got four kids, and I might adopt Token
