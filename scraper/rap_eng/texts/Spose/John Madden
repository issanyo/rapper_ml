[Verse 1: Spose]
Sitting at my mom's dreaming about paychecks with loot,
My ex-girl's boobs, and how to smoke legal like Snoop… (oops)
I'm interrupted by the door knock, **knock-knock**
4:18… Who the hell is this?!?
I get up quick, tuck my dick
I stop Drew from barkin' and get to Chris walking,
It's a face that I've seen before, Mike George
We both graduated class of '04
I look deeper, he's got trees up in a beaker
And in his fist, Backwoods and a Bic
That's that shit, Michael, is you joking or smoking
He tells me, "We got two minutes to get it toking'"
420 on the digital, this is pivotal
Cause I'm broke as fuck and I enjoy being a criminal
Right before this happened I was sitting here rapping
Watching Youtube booty clapping, PS2 action, playing:

[Hook]
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
Switch it
Tony Hawk, Ton-Ton-Tony Hawk
Tony Hawk, Ton- Ton-Tony Hawk
Say no money money no money money money
No money money no money money money
I blazed and played John Madden when I got up
(Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?)

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
You know it's Groves cause the flow's so tight
I got instrumentals downloaded, mobile device-
Just in case I want to kick it, take a go at the mic
I'm hot as hell even though Maine's colder than ice
Take what you make in a week, and i'll be folding it twice
It doesn't matter what the numbers even show on the price
I'm always taking chances like I'm rolling the dice
And I used to push the ganja from an O to a slice
But I'm learning more as I grow older in life
It's not about how many punches that you throw in the fight
It's about why you throw 'em & if you're throwing them right
And always making good goals and try to hold 'em in sight
And even though I get high, take control of the flight
It doesn't mean it's wrong, if you don't know what is right
Been into rap since way back when rollin' on bikes
And from that day rap happened to take control of my life

[Hook]
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
Switch it
Tony Hawk, Ton-Ton-Tony Hawk
Tony Hawk, Ton- Ton-Tony Hawk
Say no money money no money money money
No money money no money money money
I blazed and played John Madden when I got up
(Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?)

[Verse 3: Spose]
Don'tcha know Spose flows everyday in his life
With no grill, no bills, I refrain from the ice
And I feel like the devil might have came in the night
And made me "Tim the tool man Taylor"
Got the game in a vice
No shame when I write, bars aim to delight
Fanatics, addicts, and video gamers alike
I'm looking over my shoulder just when I'm lacing my Nikes
Because there's fake gangsters out there, just aching to fight
And I made some whack songs, now I'm making them right
Though I'm broke, nightly microwaving bacon and rice
Black Betty, white Christmas, Green Lantern comic
Red stripe in my pitcher
There is no illa, evolved gorilla, quickly breaking up that grass
Like a fucking Roto tiller
Certainly no killer, not even a fighter, but enough about that, baby, pass that lighter
Let's play some

[Hook]
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
John Madden, Jo-John, John Madden
Switch it
Tony Hawk, Ton-Ton-Tony Hawk
Tony Hawk, Ton- Ton-Tony Hawk
Say no money money no money money money
No money money no money money money
I blazed and played John Madden when I got up
(Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?)
