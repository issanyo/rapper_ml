[Intro: Spose & B. Aull]
Yo, B, you go first
I'm on it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on ya

[Verse 1: B. Aull]
Man, this life is priceless
Eventually, I'll see the shine working the night shift
Man, I hate when people hype shit
You ain't really kill it but want credit, bitch, you ISIS
No bullshiting getting by me, I'm a spike trip
Some say I'm the nicest they ever seen speak
But boy, I got a mean streak that you ain't seen leak
If I gotta, be the bearer of bad news, so be it
Dudes be Yung Jocin', what's poppin'? Just know I see it
And I know you see it too, but I be speaking on it
Ayo, what you put up in this would've got me tweaking on this?
Making yayo, I'm whipping up miracles like it's mayo
I've been fresh to death since a day old
No, I'm never fronting, always coming back like the past
Think I'm cheating, but that's just an assumption
That's what happens when year after year, you on top
Non-stop, we turn nothin' into somethin', what's up, boy?

[Hook: Armies]
You don't know my name
You should be ashamed
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you

[Verse 2: Spose]
Made an album in a day, man, I'm so crazy
It's almost 4:44, somebody call Jay Z
Just to add another wrinkle like an old lady
It takes you forever 'cause you're all lazy
You look blue and faded, you're like Old Navy
I'm thankful for this shit, it's so gravy
You got one fan, that's your mom, maybe
Call my phone, hear five rings, that's Tom Brady
Gems, I hide these in my bars
Like girls with huge titties who always wear scarves
Most of y'all gon' play it again, GOAT's what I majored in
Halo what I made it in, your skin is paper thin
Flow hot Arabian, my home's all Acadian
Nose all Canadian
Bro, shame on you, I put the blame on you
I might unplug the microphone and sick Shane on you (P. Dank)

[Hook: Armies]
You don't know my name
You should be ashamed
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you
