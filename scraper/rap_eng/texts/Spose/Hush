[Verse 1]
They don't want me to be rich
They just want me to be broke
They don't want me on the charts
They just want me in a hole
They don't want me to be me
They just want me to be them
But the only people that are into them are their friends
They don't bump me in the car
They don't bump me on the bus
They don't know they would get far
If they did it like us
Talk about being at the bar
Tell their buddies I suck
They don't want me to balloon
They just want me to be crushed

[Hook]
And they want me to hush
(Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, hush)
But I won't shut up
And they want me to hush
(Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, hush)
But I won't shut up
I must be doing damn, I must be doing damn good
I must be doing damn, I must be doing damn good
Alright y'all, here we go, yeah

[Verse 2]
They have had enough
They want me to hush
They want to hire doctors just to sew my lips shut
But they don't know no doctors so I tell them that they suck
Try to take the fucking money out my cup, what the fuck
They will never shush they were never timid
Silkk the Shocker flow, never had No Limits
All the pothead chicks with it
Let me see you put the fucking purple to your mouth like you're sucking off Grimace (what!?)
Put the purple to your mouth like you're sucking off Grimace (what!?)
Put the purple to your mouth (what!?)
Put the purple to your mouth (what!?)
Put the pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
(what!?)(what!?)(what!?)(what!?)


[Hook]
1, 2, 3
And they want me to hush
(Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, hush)
But I won't shut up
And they want me to hush
(Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, hush)
But I won't shut up
I must be doing damn, I must be doing damn good
I must be doing damn, I must be doing damn good

Well alright, y'all, we're about two minutes into this mother right now

[Verse 3]
Well alright, y'all, we're about two minutes into this mother right now
We're going to keep on breaking it on down for you all if you don't mind
It goes S-P-O-S
I know they want to see me with a bullet in my chest
'Cause with the microphone I tend to be blessed
And they be staring at me mean-mugging all unimpressed
I think theses dudes would be more at home
If I was laying in the road like an orange cone
So they could run into my home to steal my poems
While I got the hemoglobin leaking out of my dome
While I got the hemoglobin leaking out of my dome
(While I got the hemoglobin leaking out of my dome)
(Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!)
Break it down, it goes

[Hook]
1,2,3
And they want me to Hush (but I won't shut up)
I must be doing damn good

[Verse 4]
If they could I know they would all stop me
Grab me, stab me, shoot me, drop me
Bunch of FedEx Kinkos copies
Bunch of carnivores trynna eat broccoli
I'm hardcore but they think that I'm a softy
Death by Spose on their autopsies
I was up early killing it, Chachie
Sunrise-orange like a can of Moxie
Get your wolf pack, try to out fox me
Look I'm bright cause the lime light got me
On my nineteenth iced-coffee
And they want me to hush
