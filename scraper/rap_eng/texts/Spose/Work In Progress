[Hook: Spose & Shane Reis]
I'm a work in progress
I might just work forever
I know the sun is shining behind this cloudy weather
And I, I'm not perfect
But I'm, I'm getting better
I'm a work in progress, I might just work forever
I don't know

[Verse 1: Spose]
I can't help but feel like I'm destined to do this but I'm in my way
I'm working it, working it, working it, working it every day
I chiseled the sculpture, I take a look at it, that ain't how I planned it
I might need to switch my perspective and view from a whole 'nother vantage
Cause some of the things you could say about me would be true, and be disparaging
I hope I don't leave none of those traits to my daughters when I die in their inheritance
I'm a bright spark in a dark room, I'll persevere, that's how I'm built
I won't wait, I will work till I'm great, I made more mistakes than my grammy made quilts
I am part one, wait for part two
Got my leg in the door in '04 from my dreaming, was screaming "somebody record me"
I promise I will be dope when I'm forty
Now I got my whole body in the room, bitch
Sorry I called you a bitch
I get excited, I'm talking my shit
I feel like Kanye but white and not rich
I am a desk full of stuff, stacked
Agressive, a muskrat
I will stretch, I will touch, tap
I'm a sketch, I'm a rough draft
But I'm wide awake, and I'm tossing and turning
And I can't sleep at times
Got my family on my mind
And I'm gon' work until they never have to work no more

[Verse 2: Shane Reis]
I don't know what to think, they put out a tape every month
Maybe it's them, or maybe it's me, or maybe I don't write enough
But when you only write what you feel
Sometimes it kinda gets tough
Cause the world is moving so fast
And I'm not feeling so young
I was just a kid, say 17, and I entered in a new world, never had a plan
Face bare, so was the planner, saw my old man pimp himself out the truck for not enough bucks
He said, "Son, it's gonna be tough, at least I gave you a work ethic and some manners"
Maybe got the manners from my mother, now I gotta fill the cupboards when you hammer for the supper
They told me we work in the cold and the snow and the rain, welcome to Maine
Fresh out of grade twelve, not getting paid well, walking on eggshells
Eight years later, couple tapes and a record
Between being on the road and being up at the same time that I'm getting home
It feels like I work forever
Young, good, gotta do better
Two little dudes like a mirror made of pressure
I could never ever give the minimal of effort
I know she got me, rich, broke or whatever
I consider it never, I'd rather have less than a drip in the desert
Did not ever stitch in the dresser, or listen to Ke$ha
I work when I'm sick and I'm hurt till I'm better
Cause money is money, you can't never make enough and can't pay attention to them, they saying nothing
If they not down unless something big comes around, then there's nothing up for discussion
That's everybody, me included, I'm turning up, like the heat's included
They're complaining about no savings to make these payments but still I'm changing
