[Intro: Spose]
Let's go, Joe

[Pre-Hook: J Spin]
From that 207 (Yeah), a whole new era (Ayup)
Tryna hurt my stripes like you know Lou Gehrig
Two stepping on my way to my basement
Damn, it feels good when you live it and it makes sense
How do you know?

[Hook: J Spin]
When shit hit the fan, you be like, "God damn"
Then start working for them fans
It depends where I'm going, how I feel like
I just wanna keep on making music till it's midnight, yeah

[Verse 1: J Spin]
They see we pulled up, skrrrt
Riding in a Roll with a ziplock of purp
Used to think I had a curse, the way my luck's been
Hearse done had too much friends
Searchin', tryna free my mind, but they just tryna cuff hands
Damn, since I was little my focus was be the bigger man
I seen these kids take directions, I couldn't understand
But I just stuck to plan, that's all that I did
Bring my crew up to another land and see how they live
I'll probably work my ass off to my gravestone
Shorty gotta tip my head off for [?] great dome
Caught up in a rainstorm, like I been running my whole life
Ain't even in my twenties, even, fast, and I'm so nice
Won't choke twice, that's a bet, now I just rap with the best
Play for the cash and collect and vrrrm, my fam under [?]
They tryna check what's on my résumé
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'm saying, "Better than yesterday"

[Verse 2: Spose]
I was in my Nissan four door, bet I made 'em forlorn
Whipping by a Forbes, make the floorboards warped
In my Wells Maine warlord shorts but I'm in it for the long haul
I'll be here a couple years, probably when LeBron's bald
Oh, I used to drive a fish truck
Walk up in like, "Gonna need a signature for this, bub"
Oh, now compensation for my observations
Check my compilation, conversation, that's my occupation
Me and J Spin out the basement looking like some heroes
(Where you from?) From the 04090
My material is strong, seven days in a week
Yeah, I work, everyone's [?] my house is on the beach
Just stare up at my pupils, got that shit you can't teach
Like I'm driven like I got chauffeur over in the streets
And they're gonna keep it driving till we end up at the peak
Then we looking down, like, "Fuck all you clowns," me and Joey like...
