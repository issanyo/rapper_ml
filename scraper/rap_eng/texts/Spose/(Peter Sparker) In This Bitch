[Verse 1]
I been telling fools, you can keep your pool full of jewels
Since back in high school, when G-Unit was cool
Man, they still talk about the things Ryan Peters pulled
On the mi-i-ic, indefatigable
And where Spose at? Look smokey
Where's your hoes at? Where my homies?
Get some Prozac, you look lonely
Watch me break it down, I'm like a roady
Where's your coke rap? In the nose bleeds
Your go-to steez caked in your goatees
No OG, but I G O for the G O L D
Bro, you know me

[Hook]
Woo!
Alright!
Peter Sparker in this bitch
Woo!
Alright!
Peter Sparker in this bitch

[Verse 2]
I'm slapping silly bands off of rappers' wrists
I rap immaculate, you hate me? Sacrilege
You think I suck? Well you don't know the half of it
And secondly, that's just wildly inaccurate
Check the stat sheet, looks gorgeous
You must've heard wrong, check your sources
Silly rabbits outsmarted by a tortoise
Lyrically, they got balls on their noses, porpoise
A bunch of dudes misconstrued Spose's purpose
Fucking serpents, I leave 'em serviced
â€˜Cause my words flow together like it's cursive
You look nervous, Peter Sparker in this bitch

[Hook]
Woo!
Alright!
Peter Sparker in this bitch
Woo!
Alright!
Peter Sparker in this bitch

[Verse 3]
I got that "good times" rap, you should get involved
Puff the peace pipe, chip a wall
I'm a mix of John Steinbeck and Biggie Smalls
You're a mix of vaginas and midget balls
Peter Sparker, my only competition
Writtens glisten, you'd know it if you listened
If you didn't, you'd probably think different
I turn white owls into roaches, magician
And I could tell you about Israel and Palestine
But I'd rather show these sucker rappers how to rhyme
I'm not here to pontificate or speak down
I'm just tryna have a good time 'fore I peace out
