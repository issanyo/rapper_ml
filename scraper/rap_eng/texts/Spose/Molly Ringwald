[Verse 1]
So as I sip my third Heineken, I feel disturbed
Stupefied by the tools and the fools I observe
In the spot's where I rock, they deserve not a word
In a column, I'm not ballin' but I'll throw you all a curve
Lounging with my baby mama, chillin' watching Jeopardy
I can hear you in the kitchen trying to steal my recipes
But I should play dumb - I'll talk about weed
Talk about Wells, so you don't see up my sleeves
I'm counting cash made from the shirts
To counteract the night I had to take off work
Me and Bees kept trees in the freezer
I had tracks over Weezer, it's like
I'm sorry geezer, (but,) but this isn't the old days
You think I like Coldplay, I hear what you don't say
I could read between the lines
As if I broke up coke upon the New York Times
I'm making that at every opportunity
Recognize nobody's hungry
I'll make you food to me!

[Verse 2]
So pass the Texas Pete, watch me sex this beat
I spend my money wisely, no thoughts of Lexus ES
You think it's all John Madden, Tony Hawk
I'll let you think that, I'll formulate the plot - Mac
They got it crooked, I'm booking December gigs in August
Album sales solid, I'm BICing your freakin' wallet
I'm honestly promising to be sicker than jaundice
Sippin' gin and tonic, smirkin'
I'm just a different type of person
I've been thinkin' of my master plan
In a smoke-filled whip, freestyling, just ask my man, Cam
You're exactly where you were five years ago
And me, I'm not even where I was a beer ago
Or what have you, I rock shows with Matthew
Now everybody'd like to beat Spose in battles
Quarter tank of gas on the road less-traveled
Save your opinion, baby
I don't think I asked you, did I?

[Verse 3]
As I sip my fifth Heineken, I calm my nerves
No use giving flight to a dead bird
No use giving hope to a lost cause
I'd be better off trying to take a cripple for a jog
We brought these rhymes and guitars and drums
From where we're from
Just to show you show you how far we've come
It's like, why kick dirt if we all can stay grounded?
Why throw stones if we all could move mountains?
But my only opponent is me
And the demons between here and where I'm growing to be
Good God, I know I'm gonna need my help
If I'm ever gonna beat myself
'Till then, I rock mics for these Mikes and these Zacharies
I'll make them feel the opposite of apathy
As long as I got this faculty in back of me
Know it's a steady climb with these rhymes toward my apogee
