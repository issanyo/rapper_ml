[Intro: Spose]
Max, would you give that Prince, that Prince sh-sh...
Ugh!
[?] come on!

[Verse 1: Spose]
It is he, who, to verses shows no mercy
Fucking blazed, always looking like I just ate turkey
In my life, no red dots, neither guns nor herpes
Bong water, murky
I'll be perched at my mom's, breaking up some mersh
Smelling like a marsh, probably just got out of work, ugh
The state of Maine sustains temperatures far below 30
Girls nips get perky, it's regularly snowing
In the winter in a blizzard with the scissors and saliva
Cold as ice up in your Chrysler, we get higher than a Boeing
And as I inhale
Just know that in New Hampshire came close to jail but made bail
Now your sister feels me like braille
As I clutch a Sam Adams Boston Ale
I'm unshaven with a hoodie, I'm looking like an adulterer
I'm swerving out of Irving in a resin-colored Altima
Altogether bimpin', also I don't care
I smoke trees, ironically the shirt reads "D.A.R.E"
"Been there, done that", mud on the hubcaps, go!
Everybody clap and sing along!

[Hook: Spose & Crowd]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Take another blunt - clap!
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Take another blunt to the -

[Interlude: Spose]
Make some noise for my man right here!
[?] come on!
Break, break, break it all down
Keep it going, man! Keep it going, don't stop
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go!
That's right, man, this dude right here is putting it down
He's getting his ten - his fifteen bucks worth
If you're unaware, my name is Spose, I'm from Wells, Maine, USA
It's a pleasure to be here tonight with these amazing musicians
With you beautiful people, alright

[Verse 2: Spose]
Backwoods emblem as the blunt sesh assemblin'
The summer bare arms like the second amendment
You can find me just hanging like an ornament
Snorting jagged little pills, call 'em Alanis Morissette
We don't drive slow, speed like Sandra Bullock
Avoid the Wells Po in our parents' Tahoes
Kick it inconspicuous when gripping on the stickiest
As we lurk the backroads
In garages, dads blaze while they're playing Van Halen
Spent a lot of wages on being inebriated
T-shirt untucked, bubbler packed up
Proving thus: I been nuts since my bowl cut
We got sex but no pistols, Wells, Maine, no bullets
Thick hickish accents, sweatpants and mullets
The healthy, the wealthy, the salads, the croutons
I'm microwaving Hot Pockets, sleeping on the futon
Pass the grass, alas I don't care
I smoke trees, ironically the shirt reads "D.A.R.E."
"Been there done that," mud on the hubcaps
Wells, Maine, everybody sing along!

[Hook: Spose & Crowd]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Take another blunt to the -
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
[?] come on!
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Everybody, get on down

[Interlude: Spose]
Yo, Ryan!
This guy is still going, man!
Ryan, let's get him up on the stage
Do you see him in the balcony? Do you see this dude?
He didn't break his arm
Alright, man, let's do this
Let's try this hook out a couple times
I'm gonna need everyone in the balcony
Front to the back to sing along with us
We'll do it three times:
The first time we'll do it, we'll have some [?]
Second time will be [?]
And then we're gonna go balls to the wall, okay?
Let's try it out!

[Hook: Spose & Crowd]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Everybody, clap!
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Sing it!
Whoa, whoa
Alright, everybody keep clapping
Whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, what!?
I take another blunt to the -
Whoa, whoa

Take another blunt to the head

Whoa, whoa
Take another blunt to the -
Whoa, whoa

[Outro: Spose]
Everybody with me say, "No money money, no money money money"
No money money, no money money money
Say, "No money money, no money money money"
No money money, no money money money
Thank you guys
Yo, make some noise for the homie, Ethan!
