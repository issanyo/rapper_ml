I know some dudes I used to blaze with back when we were revelers
I see them now-a-days and I know they could do betterer (that's not a word)
They haven't done anything, they're some settlers
I want to smash the glass on their ass, hit the red alert
What you want to be man, regular?
Get out of bed, get your head on leveler
If you wanted it, you could be a senator
If you really wanted it, you could be an emperor
I'm still crossing words out, I'm an editor
But prey looking edible, they see me as a predator
Competitor, or Federer or Djokavich, you're hopeless
You're broke as shit reluctantly, but you're from where the sofa is
I know you enjoy unemployment
You probably got a rash on that ass, need some ointment
What you need to do is go book you an appointment
Buckle your boots and get your gym shorts hoisted
Go out, get something and be proud of it
There's a race going on, and you're out of it
You're lamer than the populists in offices
You could be profiting and living up in opulence
But you're lazy as fuck
You couldn't pay me enough
To live the life you live buddy
You got so much free time, you make me think time isn't money
Money making, you gotta do something man, gotta get awaken
Get up out of bed and get this life up in your head
I know you were probably wishing that you were probably sleeping in instead
I know that you just need to get up, get out, and get something nice
The only way to move ahead is just to sacrifice
Everyday you sit around and you just do some dumb shit
Jerking off, watching housewives of New Brunswick
You think that I be talking about my homies
But I'm really talking about me, you'd know that if you knew me

You need to get up, get out and get something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out and get something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

I don't recall ever graduating at all
Sometimes I think I'm just a disappoint to y'all
