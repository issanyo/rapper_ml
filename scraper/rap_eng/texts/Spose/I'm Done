[Intro]
Quittin' reminiscin' 'bout the old days

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm done (I'm done) holding on to the past
Tryin' to make a million dollars and then go and take a nap
(Hell yeah) Until then no sleep
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of the two horned creep from the deep
I'm done (I'm done) holding on to the past
Tryin' to make a billion dollars and then go and take a nap
(Fuck yeah) Until then no sleep
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of the two horned creep from the

[Verse 1]
From the moment that I tripped in to the game
With a buck forty frame, MC Spose was the name
I've been trying to recapture the air in that room
With the boom of the bass and the crack of the snare
When I first spat outside my habitat
I heard O's like talking to some applejacks
Flowed like the Allagash
And I'm still lights out, like we haven't got the power back
Laughed outta battle raps, then I came back, taught 'em how to rap
Slept on for a minute, kinda like a power nap
And I'm not mad at that, but what I fear
Is I hear all the seconds that are ticking off the hour glass
That's the past, and now it's the present
I'm just waking up to put it down with my brethren
All the gremlins, they can bicker over what they had once
Man I hope they have fun, but you know what?

[Hook]
I'm done (I'm done) holding on to the past
Tryin' to make a million dollars and then go and take a nap
(Hell yeah) Until then no sleep
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of the two horned creep from the deep
I'm done (I'm done) holding on to the past
Tryin' to make a billion dollars and then go and take a nap
(Fuck yeah) Until then no sleep
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of the two horned creep from the

[Verse 2]
From the '04, '09, zero, folk hero
I just got a passport, I'm looking for some euros
‘Cause I'm quittin' reminiscin' 'bout the old days
Even though I wouldn't take 'em back, man, no way
Not even all the beers I had to vomit up
When I was Ryan, rhyming ill but still anonymous
And Casey Mack used to burn the marijuana up
And Stiky-1 and I had Alizé in a McDonald's cup
We used to bump Cannibal Ox
Freestyle for hours down at Cameron's spot
And then meet up with degenerate hotties
And hope they give brain like generous zombies
Then we peace out, go to congas at 3 AM
Then we wake up at noon thirty, do it again
Man, I remember that fondly
But it's time to let go, move on, get money

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm done (I'm done) holding on to the past
Tryin' to make a million dollars and then go and take a nap
(Hell yeah) Until then no sleep
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of the two horned creep from the deep
I'm done (I'm done) holding on to the past
Tryin' to make a billion dollars and then go and take a nap
(Fuck yeah) Until then no sleep
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of the two horned creep from the

[Verse 3]
From the front to the back, from the back to the balcony
Down to the bathroom, their nasals all powdery
Dank undoubtedly
I will speak the truth till they know what I'm "aboot" out in Calgary
Till in London they wonder if I'm the best
Till they say I'm "bloody great" like period sex (Ew)
"Spose you fuckin' would," Yeah, you're damn right
The speech thief, I stole your show in the night
But, I'm not the crook type, more the read-a-book type
Chauffeur? No sir, doper than I look like
I don't cook dope, crooked hat, though
Bookin' rap shows so that I won't be a footnote
I make 'em put they hands up for these monkey bars
Sipping good, looking scotch, whipping ugly cars
And yeah I got some nugs to spark
But first I got a couple businesses I'd love to start

[Hook]
So I'm done (I'm done) holding on to the past
Tryin' to make a million dollars and then go and take a nap
(Hell yeah) Until then no sleep
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of the two horned creep from the deep
I'm done (I'm done) holding on to the past
Tryin' to make a billion dollars and then go and take a nap
(Fuck yeah) Until then no sleep
‘Cause sleep is the cousin of the two horned creep from the

[Outro]
Time to let go
Time to let go
Time to let go
