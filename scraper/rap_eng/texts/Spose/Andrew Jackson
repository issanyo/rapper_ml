[Intro: Spose]
I've been all over the states, I've been all over the place
With that same look on my face

[Verse 1: Spose]
I was born mint, I started out in Denver
Born in 1996, first day of September
I was at a bank, then a woman took me
And she drove me out to Vegas and she gave me to a bookie
A man won me fair and square, he had bet on Tyson
A hot gun touched me that night after violence
I woke up in Cali, I got traded for some weight
I got hidden in a mattress 'til like 1998
When I finally emerged, the sunlight it was blindin'
I got traded for a ticket to see Saving Private Ryan
And now I'm at a bank, where I kick it like I'm Chun-Li
Everybody give me up, it seems like no one loves me
Then I'm in a Brink's truck, road tripping to come east
I traveled more miles than Davis and Plumlee
I came out a machine, '99, caught a glimpse
It was New Year's Eve, they were listening to Prince

[Hook: Ben Thompson & Spose]
What's my name?
Andrew Jackson, Andrew Jackson
Andrew Jackson, Andrew Jackson
They spend, they stash me, come out the bank, I'm laughin'
Tarnish my name with taxes, but you can't change the fact that
I've been all over the states, I've been all over the place
With that same look on my face, Andrew Jackson
I've been all over the states, I've been all over the place
With that same look on my face, Andrew Jackson

[Verse 2: Spose]
Nine months later, ten days after my birthday
A girl traded me for water, that she then poured on her face
Then I was in the pocket of a coat covered in ash
I left New York that evening, I was never coming back
Then I was in a coat in a attic or a basement was to be
Until someone took me to Goodwill in 2017
I got purchased and I ended up in those Levi's blue jeans
And I road triped out to Vegas for that show Jason Aldean
A bullet pierced my face, maroon covered my body
I assume the person I was with, I think he made it, probably
But me, I'm not the same, I got broken into change
And discarded in a garment, man, they hardly knew my name

[Hook: Ben Thompson & Spose]
My name is
Andrew Jackson, Andrew Jackson
Andrew Jackson, Andrew Jackson
They spend, they stash me, come out the bank, I'm laughin'
Tarnish my name with taxes, but you can't change the fact that
I've been all over the states, I've been all over the place
With that same look on my face, Andrew Jackson
I've been all over the states, I've been all over the place
With that same look on my face, ay, Andrew Jackson

[Outro: Spose]
Not Michael Jackson, not Janet Jackson
Not Joe Jackson, not Randy Jackson
Michael Jackson, not Janet Jackson
Not - Andrew Jackson
I made this album in a day, I could put this shit right away
I don't know why I'm in this place, I get those Andrew Jacksons
I got that passion, shout out Ben Thompson
I know they want it, Andrew Jackson
