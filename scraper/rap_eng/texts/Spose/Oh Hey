Welcome to sunny Wells, Maine"

[Verse 1: Spose]
I spit it for my pot heads, smoking out of cantaloupes
Even for a rich chick, stuck up like a camel toe
Who showed you want it means to live?
My rhymes tighter than the jeans on scenester kids
I wanted to get rich, but I got broke first
Been thin, skin color of Oakhurst, a dope verse
Well, that is guaranteed if you're with me
Or you just got rims on your ATV
I rocked a sold out show, I lost my voice
The next day a little weezy, but not the hot boys
I step into a party, I'm smelling like low tide
Guys give me high-5s and the girls know why
Oh my, who's that? Spose and I'm back
Pdank in the bank, dutch drank in my grasp
At last, still drugs, girls, liquor
Big flicks in the whip with the Sugarloaf sticker
Until we retire we'll be flyer and higher than Peter Pan
If you want to be the man, just be me and Cam
Damn, Wells, Maine for the record
Flannel shirt checkered
We smoked it all
