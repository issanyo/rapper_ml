[Verse 1: Spose]
I worked for so hard so long that I deserve to feel like this
Victory lap when I walk out the crib
I gotta piss but they're all on my dick these days
Feeling plus not a minus these days
Can I get my shine in for Pete's sake (For Pete's sake)
Let me take it back
I remember when nobody ever heard of him
My mom worked at Burger King
My dad was a cable guy
We wondered how we ate at night
And then they got divorced, I was crying when they said goodbye (I love you guys)
Throw your food stamps in the air if you empathize
Now I run an enterprise
You know what I symbolize
Even if I die I will never die
Opposite of 9/11 feeling like November 9th
'Cuz I...

[Hook: Dave Gutter]
I got that shit that makes Rick Ross go (Huh)
Make Jay-Z go (Yup)
Make Kanye Go (haah?)
I know you're at a loss for words
What could you say?

[Verse 2: Spose]
I used drive in a cutlass
Heat never worked though
Back door busted
Climbing from the first row
Take it to the back seat didn't bother me none
Mom worked two jobs I was on free lunch
If you want an update, I don't got no down time
High digging 45's added of this cloud 9
I think I made a difference with the mic now
I'm making suicidal kids put the knife down
'Cuz I've worked for so hard so long I deserve to feel this good
They said we couldn't but what if we could?
They said we wouldn't but we knew we would
P. Dank
Making plus out of minus these days
And I don't have no work shirt or briefcase
And no name tag
It's the same cat
Putting Maine on the map and I'm back

[Hook: Dave Gutter]
I got that shit that makes Rick Ross go (Huh)
Make Jay-Z go (Yup)
Make Kanye Go (haah?)
I know you're at a loss for words
What could you say?

[Verse 3: Spose]
I be spittin' with the viciousness
I be addin' to my dividends
I be reppin' all the villages for all of my constituents
And everyone applaud, Big Sean go (oh god)
Make 2 Chainz go (Tru!)
Make Jadakiss go (Eh-HEEEEEEEEEEHH!)
Make Biggie go (Baby!)
Make French Montana go (haaan)
Never thought it would be like this
Never thought I'd MC like this
To the point where I walk up in the restaurant
The chef come out the kitchen and he give me free trees like this
He said "Keep reppin me like this"
I said I will
I'll be the people's douche until the day that I get killed
And I don't got no land plots full of crops
Drop tops, yachts by the dock
You know what I got
I got

[Hook x2: Dave Gutter]
I got that shit that makes Rick Ross go (Huh)
Make Jay-Z go (Yup)
Make Kanye Go (haah?)
I know you're at a loss for words
What could you say?
