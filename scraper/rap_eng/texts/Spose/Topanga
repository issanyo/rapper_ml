[Verse 1]
Since skipping into second-grade math, I've been so confident
These rappers' words all sound the same, that's like a homonym
Steps of regrets got me climbing to accomplishments
I rap, plus I could run for fucking governor or Congressman
Pipe up in my Nikes when I'm ducking from the constable
You talk about it, I really do it, we're not comparable
That's style that you borrowed hard to swallow, not digestible
If we were to stand here side-by-side, we're not symmetrical
You could never make a song that did what "I'm Awesome" did
I'm under hundred thousand from platinum, I'm feeling awesome, bitch
I probably made your salary in royalties from Mr. D
You're sisterly, you're dissin' me, no mystery, you're history

[Chorus]
I think you need to get high and bump some bangers
Drink it with some strangers
Rhyming every word until it takes away your anger
Just get high and bump some bangers
Sip whiskey, every flavor
Get ice rocky like a quarry
Find a girl look like Topanga, hold up

[Verse 2]
My girl look like Topanga
If she was born again, I guess that's probably what they'd name her
I had some brushes, what's that, with the law
That's like a painter
Man, these rappers look depressed, go pull the weed out the container
Bro, I started as a peasant, but the king I became
Fuck every rapper in my state who's not on PDank
And every dude that that includes could diss me all on one track
You put it out, it gets 100 views, 'cause you guys are trash
While I really been making the paper
Been grindin' and workin' so long on achieving the vision
I'm up on the mountain, it feel like it's hot
And I just looked around, I got no competition, it's lonely (it's lonely)
At the top of the summit, I'm up in the clouds
My blood and my sweat on my boots and my t-shirt
I wanna discuss it, but no one's around
I been up, I been down
I been up, up, and down, but I don't need no sympathy
I fell to the ground, I fell to the ground
I made it through my injuries
Did I hurt your feelings?
No no, I don't give a fuck
If you're gonna diss me, you can't be, 'cause all your music sucks
I really don't fuck with, like, anyone
I've just been driving 'round with my shit on repeat
I been prolific with spitting, I finished this song within minutes of getting the beat
I'm adamant, they're mad at it, they're wack as shit
See, this what happens when the average kids
Try stepping in the jungle with the savages

[Chorus]
I think you should get high and bump some bangers
Drink it with some strangers
Rhyming every word until it takes away your anger
Just get high and bump some bangers
Sip whiskey, every flavor
Get ice rocky like a quarry
Find a girl look like Topanga, hold up

[Verse 3]
My girl smart like Topanga
I got her, I was into her when she was just a stranger
And I don't fit in my division, guess I'm the remainder
Man, these rappers so depressed, go pull the weed out the container
They want that old PDank, that smoke a bowl PDank
That roll a Backwoods in a Chrysler in the cold PDank
They don't want that new PDank, them beards have grew PDank
He had some kids, but he still kept his attitude PDank
No, I'm just playing, they still love me, man, my army is strong
Bro, I'm still putting work in, just don't party as long
I been dope since they had beepers, I won't shut up, I'm a talker
Man, my girl is such a keeper, you might think she's playing soccer
Channing hit me with the stems, I planted the seed
My homies own grow houses, so they just give me the weed
I made the poster, did my taxes, what I did in a week
I feel like the Colts and Pacers aren't as indie as me
But I'm never relying on no one
And I'm never waiting, I got so much faith in myself
That I'll get a tattoo of Ryan, no lyin'
A lion defeating and eating gazelles
I been in the jungle, I'm feeling like Axel
I'm ready for battle, I'm feel like the best
Why you guys all look so stressed?

[Chorus]
I think you should get high and bump some bangers
Drink it with some strangers
Rhyming every word until it takes away your anger
Just get high and bump some bangers
Sip whiskey, every flavor
Get ice rocky like a quarry
Find a girl look like Topanga, hold up
