[Verse]
This is white girls twerking at a funeral
With tattooed babies in the back sniffing superglue
And all the twelve-year-olds dressed unsuitable
And posting pictures online until they feel beautiful
Fuck it, I don't gotta suit up in a cubicle
The dude up in a Subaru with Buddha in the cuticles
I need cash, so here's math for you to do
I'm selling four hundreds in Roman numerals
I've got them itching for it sorta like an allergen
A local Paladin I got the rappin' for the Alisons
They used to wonder where the talent went
Spizzy showed up with the L like I was holding an Allen wrench
Half these cats baffling, whack battling
My shit was happening back when you were saplings
And now it's like a full grown Redwood tree
S- fucking P- O- S- E
Call me Maine Gretzky but I don't rock ice
It's more like in my life you might find lice
No 'D's on the 'Lac, no bees in the trap
Just fleas on the cat, and weed in the sack
I started cooking crack just so I could use the metaphors
On tour meet hella more Elinors
But that didn't help my record get to selling more
The only cheese I got is inside my deli drawer
Still practicing rapping I wasn't born great
Trees inside a paper like a sports page
And I still wear my acne like it's war paint
And this is second coming like re-doing a porn take
I can't front dude I made it to your tour date
And I just didn't feel it like urinating in warm lakes!

[Outro: Spose & Announcer]
Hand's together make some noise everybody [?]
I appreciate every one of you motherfuckers
My name is Spose, I'm from Wells, Maine USA
Thank you
Everybody say P-Dank!
(P-Dank!)
That's good enough for me man, I'll see you at the merch table if you need me to Baptize you or anything
Thank you
How about it one more time put your hands together make some noise for.. Spose!
