[Hook]
Don't take it away, don't take it away, don't take it away now
Don't take it away, don't take it away, yeah
I say, I wanna keep it, I say, I wanna keep it
I say, I wanna keep it, and not give it up
I say, I wanna keep it, and I like it just the way it is

[Verse 1]
For the deaf people who will never hear this song
Let's appreciate it while it's on
For every soldier who got hit by a roadside bomb and lost an arm
If you got an arm put your fuckin' arm in the sky for 'em
(Don't take it away now)
Lotta dead people, let's feel alive for 'em
Lotta people down low, let's get high for 'em
Lotta people gave up, so let's try for 'em
You're blue and feeling fresher than some wintergreen
Fall for the simple things, summer days, sipping Poland Spring
Don't take it away, give it to me
I would go to war to keep living in peace
You're looking at a glass half empty, well that's stupid
I've never seen a suicide bombing or mass shootin'
So fuck your format, dreary forecast
I'm not for that, cop a four-pack, pedal to the floormat
Life is a highway and I'mma speed on it
Grass over here got a lot of green on it
I learned to walk, learned to talk, learned to read on it
I know it's hard to hear in the panic
With all the terrible damage
And Donald's fear and his antics
Inciting fear in hispanics
Don't take what we are for granted
It's a miracle, damn it
So wipe the tears from your [?]
This fucking spherical planet
Are you kidding me? We're floating on a space rock
Pull the titties out the tank top
Not worried 'bout what I ain't got
I'm feeling so good, so don't

[Hook]
Don't take it away, don't take it away, don't take it away now
Don't take it away, don't take it away, yeah
I say, I wanna keep it, I say, I wanna keep it
I say, I wanna keep it, and not give it up
I say, I wanna keep it, and I like it just the way it is

[Verse 2]
You're tryna fool us into misery
When the sun shining make you think that it was blizzarding
That's some trickery
Smoke and mirrors with the wizardry
I've never heard a bomb, but I heard a bomb symphony
Call off the infantry
Since my infancy, been tryna smile
'Cause I- I don't got no injuries
And when it comes to positivity
I'm as hardcore as the debut album of Lil Kimberly
I'm glad if I can be as good a dad for my girls
As my dad was to us, saving lives my material
And you're nuts like a Thanksgiving packful of squirrels
If you think there's not more good than bad in the world
Time to wake up
You and fear need to break up
Just let the champagne shake up
Bro, I might bake a cake up, and I don't know how to bake
But last year my grammy died, I'll admit I barely cried
'Cause she lived past 75
That's a lot of years alive, so all I said was thanks
It was 'cause of her I drank from the fountain of life
She was my mother's creation so I appreciate the bacon and the eggs
'Cause a lot of sperm squirm, didn't make it to the eggs
We always had food, never yearned for the bread
Went to school, lotta kids couldn't learn, get ahead
This is the gift, I unwrap it every morning like it's Christmas
But it isn't, could've grimaced but I didn't, this is it
What if everything you ever wanted maybe you already got it?
If you see it, I applaud it (I wanna keep it)

[Hook]
Don't take it away, don't take it away, don't take it away now
Don't take it away, don't take it away, yeah
I say, I wanna keep it, I say, I wanna keep it
I say, I wanna keep it, and not give it up
I say, I wanna keep it, and I like it just the way it is

[Outro]
I wanna keep it
Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
No I wouldn't change a thing
Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
No I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing
No I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't change a thing
No, no I wouldn't change a thing
