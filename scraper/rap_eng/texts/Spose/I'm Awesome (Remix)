[Intro: Spose]
Whoops, I just made another Walmart anthem
Still the opposite of tall, dark, handsome
I got junk like a thumbtack, abs like a one-pack
Couldn't run one lap, hoes
My hobbies include knitting
Mittens, but that's only when I'm not snitching
These other MCs feel bad
‘Cause I just discovered that my brother is my real dad
The zaniest freak who rocks rhymes
‘Cause I simultaneously sip boxed wine
And I'm nothing but a top-notch slob
Mooching off my baby's mother in a drop-top Saab
I'm awesome (Awesome, awesome, awesome....)
(The-the sw-swa-swa-swa-swagger of a cripple)
Remix, this is a remix

[Hook 1: Spose & Mac Lethal]
Brotherfucker, I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie
I'm awesome
I'm driving 'round in my mom's ride
I'm awesome
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all your mothers online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
I would run away from a brawl
I'm awesome
There's no voicemail, nobody called
I'm awesome
Now I got Kansas City involved
Oh yeah, uh, check it out, yo (Mac Lethal, Mac Lethal)

[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
I'm awesome, sitting home alone, full of toxins
Thirty years old, looking like Macaulay Culkin
I use drugs just to hang with crazy actresses
But this ain't even cocaine, it's fucking baby laxative
Protest in public, squirting out my dick putty
My God damn girlfriend looks like Kid Cudi
Buddy, I'mma tear them apart
My friends are trendy assholes wearing Arabic scarves
(Oh you fancy, huh?) Nope, I'm just awesome
Beginner level, Street Fighter 4, using Dhalsim
I make more money selling Oxy than I could performin'
I'm masturbating while I'm reading through   the Book of Mormon
At my grandmother's funeral drunk
But it won't start until I get her body out of the trunk
My name is Mac Lethal, my style is explosive
Here, have a blunt, my little sister rolled it

[Hook 2: Mac Lethal]
She's awesome
We make it rain, and we give it
I'm awesome
Done with your girl in three minutes
I'm awesome
Laying on the couch takes work
I'd beat Nicki Minaj at Wii Tennis
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
Never run away from the cops
I'm awesome
Every single day smoking crops
I'm awesome
North Korea, you're fucking out
I'm snacking on a Push-Up Pop
Motherfucker, I'm awesome (awesome, awesome, awesome...)

[Verse 2: Spose]
(How you living, Spizzy Spose?) Oh, where should I begin?
Nissan whip, four-cylinder engine (Vroom, vroom)
All my clothes got Jnco emblems
And ah-he-heh-hem, all my friends are pretend (Lame)
Juggalos, I blend in with them
Sip wine coolers, watching Nickelodeon
Look, I'm no Don Juan with the blonde babes
‘Cause my belly's getting bulbous, my chest is concave
Chicks in Maine get migraines when my song plays
French chicks tell me, "No parle Anglais" (Excuse me)
I'm at your kid's first birthday, gin bombay
Interrupting that shit like I'm Kanye (Yo, I'ma let you finish)
I'm in a house full of cats (Rawr)
McDonald's snack wraps in the trash out back
I'm awesome, I'm getting shunned by the bloggers
While I'm sitting in a kiddie pool reading Harry Potter
I'm not lying, dude, ask my neighbors
Taco Bell what I bought with the paper
And I don't even start shit with the haters
I weigh about the same as a fat third-grader (Sup girl)
And 2010's been strange weird
Unemployed, signed in the same year
My pajama pants got reindeer
While I'm up at Applebee's drinking sangria

[Hook 3: Spose]
I'm awesome
My stomach hurts ‘cause I can't burp
I'm awesome
Fred Durst ghostwrote my last verse
I'm awesome
I'm puking up yogurt
‘Cause I think I look fat in this shirt
Motherfucker, I'm awesome
Whip exterior wood grain
I'm awesome
I just watched a softball game
I'm awesome
I'm the least famous person with fame
On stage with my clothes all stained
Motherfucker, I'm
