[Verse 1]
It's the King of Maine, but I remember getting in the game
Everybody told me I'm insane
"You should stay in college, quit the rappin'
Save a dollar, it won't happen"
They gave up and they told me to do the same
But I knew I was gonna bang, knew I was emoji with the flames
Even when your homie told me I was lame
Now he wants a verse, bro, twenty million out the purse
In my gmail, replied on the plane
Now I bag work, I don't mean coke I mean merch
Twenty-five dollars for a shirt
Since I pay six that's nineteen, profit for a hit
I'm a prophet to these kids, I'm like a church, Speezus Christ
Used to work morning to the night
So another man could live a better life
Minimally pay me then he's whipping a Mercedes
Something shady, so I made it to the May just out of spite
That's right

[Hook]
You doubted, you doubted
Can't do shit about it, I'm 'bout it
They told me, "Keep quiet, don't try it, just be Ryan"
But I told them, "I'm shouting"
Feeling like, "Haaaan," the way I went solo
Check me out, no 'nother man's logo on my polo
Defying all the exclamations, moving past the expectations
I don't got a reservation, coming from my destination
They didn't get it, then they dig it like it's excavation
My execution plus determination, I'm levitatin' (How much?)

[Verse 2]
35 hunnid for the show, that's the number right before I blow
Me, I used to work for 10.50 in the kitchen
Boss bitchin' in my vision â€˜cause there's wrinkles in my clothes
Now I write the checks, I don't know what city up next
If you think I'm bimpin' you would be correct
I got fans to my left and some money to my right
I made what you made in a month in one night
Now I'm walking in New Orleans with my homies and I'm tanning on my shoulder blades
This is what you couldn't see in older days
When I was bumping Odelay
Till I got a whip with a roof that could fold away
Or secret service jogging by my motor cave
If I had listened, my trophies and plaques in the glass wouldn't glisten
I had premonitions but they were dismissive
Thought I was lost, but now boss my description
And if I had listened to you, I'd probably still have the apron
That goes around back and then ties in the front
I quit my job, I'm my boss
I can do what I want, so just pass me the blunt

[Hook]
You doubted, you doubted
Can't do shit about it, I'm 'bout it
They told me, "Keep quiet, don't try it, just be Ryan"
But I told them, "I'm shouting"
Feeling like, "Haaaan," the way I went solo
Check me out, no 'nother man's logo on my polo
Defying all the exclamations, moving past the expectations
I don't got a reservation, coming from my destination
They didn't get it, then they dig it like it's excavation
My execution plus determination, I'm levitatin'

[Outro]
Yeah, mmm, na, na na na na
Yeah, yeah, na na na, na na na na
Oh yeah, na na na, na na na na
Need no 'nother man's logo
Need no 'nother man's logo on my polo
On my polo, on my polo, on my polo
Need no 'nother man's polo on my logo
In my photo, just need my logo
Don't need no 'nother man's logo on my polo
