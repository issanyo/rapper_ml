[Verse 1: Cam Groves]
Pocket full of ganja. Find me doing nada
So I started slanging when I’m hanging, piñata
Know I’ve been caught up with more girl drama
Forgot about a condom, thought I made a girl a mama
Getting chicks when I spit like a llama
Fat girls in the club sweating like a sauna
Fine with the lines and the rhymes that I jot up
When I take a backwood, turn it into sawdust

[Spose]
And that’s just another day in the saga
Wake up make a K-cup full of java
Whatever clothes are the opposite of Prada
My girl yoga pants in the air vinyasa
I got ricotta from pushing my product
Towel by the door on the floor de remada
Flanked by the P. Dank armada
Cam Grizz tell a whore ”HEY” posada

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
Aw shucks, got that raw stuff
I ain’t talking benching when I mention get them bars up
I’m at the bar putting down that hard stuff
Little kids see me ’round town get starstruck
P. Dank came to flip it on you hard fucks
Called up Spose ”Yo what’s up Groves, I’m at Starbucks”
We’re here to make you jump like you need a start up
Throw your hood up like your motherfucking car sucks

[Spose]
Cuz the town that i was brought up
Is like filming the ground it never get shot up
I’ll make your head bob proper call it Robert
Went from no cheese to the guaranteed offer
I got a hit from the sticks, piñata
Park it up at olive garden, chicken marsala
I used to ollie off the curb at the plaza
No gunplay just Hyundai Sonatas

[Verse 3: Cam Groves]
I’m not a balla’, shot calla’
I’m a humble dude so I believe in karma
Most these rappers lack persona
And write a wack verse just to wrap they song up
I got that kind bud, it blow your mind up
Smoking on that buddha you can call it Dalai Llama
And if you wanna little marijuana
Take a trip to Wells, Maine. You know where to find us

[Spose]
Post road in the full body pajamas
Syrup on the belly like its Camp Anawanna
Only drop top I’ve ever been in was a Mazda
Masshole  sitting in the *HONK* for the lobster
'Woods to the head that’s a blunt for it’s trauma
Paying for my new lawn with double entendres
Cam and Richard Dragon going double on Tonya
Rolling in your semi colon, colon pause comma
