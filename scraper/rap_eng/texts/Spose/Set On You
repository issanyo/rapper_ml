Check, check, check
I can't hear myself
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, uh huh, okay
Hell nah, hell no, hell nah

[Verse 1]
Picture me chillin', grillin' in a kitchen I know very well
Sticky humid, caramel, heat unparalleled
Daydreamin' of the moment
That I clock out and I get home and
Pack of a Backwoods wrap with the shwag from the domes
And spin it like a carousel
Cloaked in sweat, is it quittin' time yet?
The clock's slow, see it tickin' like a kid with Tourettes (fuck, cunt, shit)
It's getting hot in hurr (here)
I can't take off my clothes
Wanna leave, put my feet up
In a beat up V-dub, people, I got my mind

[Hook]
Set on you
Set on you
Oh no he didn't!
Set on you (I got my mind)
Set on you (I got my mind)
Set on you (I got my mind)
Set on you ( got my mind)
Set on you

[Verse 2]
Oh hey, guy
Per-per-per chance you can relate and
You've been waitin' since September
You're done being studious, show you where the booty is
Here is the agenda
La-last class of the year, you're free at three
Got a keg party by the lake at eight
Can't wait, cause beer's what you need
But it's only two, it's feeling like the minute hand's glued
Can't wait to get baked, celebrate with your crew
Make sluts out of prudes
DJ spinning vinyl, keg tapped like spinal
But you're stuck in the fuckin' class
Sittin' back, trapped on your ass tryin' to pass this final
My mind

[Hook]
Set on you (I got my mind)
Set on you (I got my mind)
Set on you (I got my mind)
Set on you

Talk to the drums!

[Bridge]
Uh, bro, d-d-do it, do it, do it
Uh, go, let me see you do it, do it, do it
Uh huh, when you do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, go
Then you're gonna get the munchies, say "ocho"
Chillin' with numerous Ho Hoes you know
With the red cup - solo, Red Sox logo
Runnin' down the block from the po-po, fuck them
Who you're knowin' in the new photo doin' blow
With a bro that you didn't know
Pukin' in the bushes with a dude named Spose
Waking up alone, cause you asked to bone, but she couldn't

[Elision]
Get on you
You crazy bastard!
Set on you (that sucks, man)
Let me hear the saxophone!
Set on you (I said)
Set on you
Let me hear the saxophone!
Set on you (all the lesbians)
Set on you (I've lost my mind)
Set on you (I do it all the time)
Set on you (girl, I don't wanna do it)
Set on you (I've got my mind) (We'll do it x3)
Set on you (I've got my mind) (We'll do it x3)
Set on you (I've got my mind) (We'll do it x4)
Set on you (We'll do it x2)
Where the mini-golf people at?
