[Chorus: Spose]
Way back, before the present tense
I wanted to hit it, like she's Kim and I'm Eminem
The way she talked, plus her body looking heavensent
I think she'd be a dime if a dime was worth eleven cents
If a dime was worth eleven cents
Maybe twelve cents

[Verse: Spose]
It was back in the day, 1997, plus ten
(plus ten, plus ten, plus ten)
Had a crush on my boss, that is 'til the day I met her best friend
(best friend, best friend, best friend)
See, I applied for the job, went in for the interview
And then I got hired (got hired)
Three months later, skipped work to see Rage Against the Machine
And then I got fired (got fired)
You see, my boss, she was hot as a tape deck
I stopped by 'cause she held onto my last paycheck
But who comes in, dripping wet out the pool?
Man, my jaw must have hit the floor, I must have drooled
It's her roommate, not lying, man, this chick was looking too great
I wanted to move into the (meow) get the suitcase
I'm looking at her with my "who the fuck are you?" face
But, she wasn't feeling it
I peaced on her for about a week
Didn't know her first name, told my boss I wanna freak
Told her I wanna bleep, probably sounded like a creep
Told her, "That chick, your roommate, she's the girl of my dreams"
Three weeks later, saw 'em both down at Vinny's
I was twenty-one, way before I made "Jimmy!"
I was on my fifth Aliz√© mixed with Henny
Drunk, plus blunts got killed like Kenny
Then I saw her standing there, hotter than a (ow!)
Looking like (blaow!) drunk me told me, "Walk up right now"
I approach, now she stand directly next to me
She making jokes, personality impressin' me
She's funny, smart, plus she's spicy like a recipe
The type to make construction workers whistle like a referee
But also fucking good at Jeopardy
I asked her to dance and she rejected me
She lied to me, told me that this dude was her brother and she had to hang with her brother, it wasn't even her brother (ouch)
She was clearly unimpressed with me
But that night, my boss had sex with me

[Chorus: Spose]
Way back, before the present tense
I wanted to hit it, like she's Kim and I'm Eminem
The way she talked, plus her body looking heavensent
I think she'd be a dime if a dime was worth eleven cents
