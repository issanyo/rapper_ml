[Verse 1: Spose]
Ayup
I used to party all night and drive abusively
My music blaring, smoking, windows open, how it used to be
Now I'm whipping to some kid's birthday, she's two or three
Oldest daughter singing Taylor Swift up in the booster seat
Used to lay up on the beach, all day get my chest tan
Get sunburnt like Redman, get drunk later, do kegstands
Now I'm at the beach, like maybe once a year bruh
Changing diapers on the sand, hasty with a beer gut
Used to disappear up in the movies in the eighth grade
Back row, touching boobies, tryna get a HJ
Now the only girls on me are tryna snuggle up on Dad
So that they can take my phone and play that Bubble Guppies app
I used to run to the mall like I didn't care
Walking out of Foot Locker feeling like a millionaire
Now I'm growing silver hair, stroller full of children here
Eighty dollars later see me walking out of Build A Bear
I used to drive 120 down to Portsmouth (Portsmouth, Olive Garden, Portsmouth)
I told people I was having no kids, I got 4 kids, holy fuck
I was swerving in the breakdown lane, skrrt, I don't know what I did (I did, no insurance, I did)
Now if you're doing 40 in my neighborhood I'm yelling slow down
It's cause I'm old now

[Chorus: Cam Groves]
I used to party outside when it's cold out
And then I get drunk till I hit the floor, blaow
I used to titty-fuck bitches on my fold-out
But I'm old now, but I'm old now
I used to buy porn tapes, now I scroll down
Even on the weeknights I would go out
The old me probably thinks that I sold out
But I'm old now, but I'm old now

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
I used to fly 85 down the backroads
Don't know why I would drive like asshole
Nowadays, keep the numbers on the dash low
Scared that the cops are gonna catch me like a lasso
We used to smoke weed, drive around and bail cops
Then we'd hail rocks at the closest mailbox
Hanging out the window looking like a pale Pac
Shit, I even did a couple days up in a cell block
I'm a gentleman that used to be degenerate
Dropped out of college now your boy needs benefits
I could do a cork 5, landing backwards
Now I can't stand cause my goddamn back hurts
Used to party weekdays more, doing either three or four
Used to freak with sleepy whores, used to sleep on people's floors
But now I'm going home with my chick
I'm finna make a little dinner then we'll order a flick

[Chorus: Cam Groves]
I used to party outside when it's cold out
And then I get drunk till I hit the floor, blaow
I used to titty-fuck bitches on my fold-out
But I'm old now, but I'm old now
I used to buy porn tapes, now I scroll down
Even on the weeknights, I would go out
The old me probably thinks that I sold out
But I'm old now, but I'm old now

[Verse 3: Spose]
There might be a Polaroid, there wasn't Instagram
Before you cranked the Soulja Boy I passed out on the minivan
The party was crazy, there's naked girls, yeah I seen it
Now I only see kitties when my wife's breastfeeding on the couch
Twilight sparkle rainbow dash all over my house
My TV's always on the Disney channel or Sprout
(Aw Ivy, that's yucky, don't put that in your mouth, jeez)
I'm gonna need a month's notice if you wanna go out
(You know how many babysitters we have to find, dude, to go out? Seriously, you gotta let me know way in advance)

[Chorus: Cam Groves]
I used to party outside when it's cold out
And then I get drunk till I hit the floor, blaow
I used to titty-fuck bitches on my fold-out
But I'm old now, but I'm old now
I used to buy porn tapes, now I scroll down
Even on the weeknights, I would go out
The old me probably thinks that I sold out
But I'm old now, but I'm old now

[Outro: Spose & Cam Groves]
I'm stoked on this, man, stoked
Hanging out the window like a pale pock
Man, yeah that's good, that's good, I didn't even see this yesterday. Um, I could kinda hear the, I listened to it on my speakers on the Bluetooth so I could hear the snare in there, I heard the flow, uh, that shit's dope
