[Spoken Intro]
I'm tired of finding, um, you know, creative ways to beat around it or say it. I think I just need to come out and be frank with you

[Hook]
Girl, I gotta hit it now, uh
Just relax and let me smoke you down
I gotta hit it now (gotta hit it now)
Can't wait to get you in my mouth
Girl, when I smoke on you (you, you, you, you, you)
I'll smoke you down (you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
Oh yeah, let me smoke you down (you, you, you, you, you, you)
Don't say anything for a minute
I'll smoke you down one more time

[Verse]
Yo, the moon's bright, my window's cracked
I'm standin' here, you're in the sack
I pull you out, I smell you once
I put you back, girl, we gon' have some fun
I'm gon' break you off, I'm gon' make you work
'Cause you got that sticky icky, I got that uncle purp
You're in my mouth, you're smokin' hot
Shh, I hit that shit, that hit the spot
Then I heard a pop (what was that?)
Forgot a seed (whoops)
That's my bad (seriously)
Shoulda bought expensive weed (mmhmm)
But I bought that mersh (where at?)
From the dome
Pass it off (to who?)
To Cam Groves
He hits it too, and then he's done
'Cause it ain't no fun if the homie's can't have none
It's P. Sparks, I'll smoke you down
I'm tired of waiting

[Hook]
Girl, I gotta hit it now, uh
Just relax and let me smoke you down
I gotta hit it now
Can't wait to get you in my mouth
Girl, when I smoke on you (you, you, you, you, you)
I just took a bath, can I
Smoke you down (you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
I just got paid, can I
Smoke you down (you, you, you, you, you, you)
I clipped my toenails, can I
Smoke you down one more time
May I smoke on...
