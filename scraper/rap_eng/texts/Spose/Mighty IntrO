We've been waiting all year, we've been waiting all day

We've been waiting for it

[Verse]
Pan down from the pine trees, high, where you'll find me
High, with the Visine, hot, since the 90s
Misfit weirdo, [?] on the bureau, see these piles of tapes?
And I'm back for the past with a pack full of tracks, Outkast [?]
I'm still kissing the sky, huggin' the plant
Still represent the people that the Government can't
Still blunt in the hand, still comin' again
Still touring and competin', eatin' grub in the van
Mr. S to the P-I-Z-Y, be my guest
If you wanna just pass me the Backwood
Wrapped and book me a two time sweatshirt
Covered in the hair from the feline, I'm ba-ack
I don't lie when I spit, I rhyme fa-a-a-acts (Fuck that)
I'm from the Northeast, where the peeps lack teeth
Where families are inbred like yeast
But they smile in the portrait, violent divorces
Plants in the house, got ants in the couch
Where the single dads workin' just to snuggle the kids
And the single moms twerkin', workin' double the shifts
If you don't got no money, you don't get to compete
So the shit is in me to rep the citizen [?]
So they listen to my vision when it's hittin' a beat
Because I spit for the weak till I'm forbidden to speak
It's Dankonia, looking opposite of California
East of route NH3, but not Ammonia

[Outro]
You know what I'm saying? We just really trying to revive the whole Hip-Hop game
