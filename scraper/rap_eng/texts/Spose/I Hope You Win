[Intro: Aria Zarnoski]
I hope you see the beauty in your eyes
I hope you dream big as mountains and climb
I hope you know you're spiritual, divine
I hope you win, I hope you win, I know you will in time

[Bridge: Myles Bullen]
Love is unproportionate, gratitude, damn fortunate
Jealousy, I won't let in, not mad at you, I hope you win

[Hook: Myles Bullen]
I hope you win, I hope you win
I hope you win, I hope you win

[Verse 1: Myles Bullen]
Don't need money to be glowing rich
You'll get your scratch when you know your itch
You'll get that cash when you know your niche
Go and get, go and get, go and get
Anything you could imagine you would ever need
Get on top of the world, put eyes on parts of the world
That you've never seen
You're blessed, I hope you succeed
Get through what you're going through
Take a moment to just sit and breathe
You're better than what you would like to believe

[Pre-Hook: Myles Bullen]
I'm telling you that you're intelligent
Born to spread your benevolence
There's a well of wealth inside you
So find out where you're fortunate
That's where your fortune is
That's where your fortune is

[Hook: Myles Bullen]
I hope you win, I hope you win
I hope you win, I hope you win

[Verse 2: Myles Bullen]
Won't waste my time on hating you
I got way too many things that are great to do
Work hard as I can, get shit done
Love what I do, my job is love
Love is wisdom, drumming rhythm
Heartbeat keeping me in time, in time, in line, in line
Beatbox poetry, art rapper designed to fly
Live out this life, street art revolution
DIY till I die, you came just in time
Just in time to say goodbye, now wake up, wake up

[Verse 3: Spose]
I hope you don't die, I hope that you win
And turn going out of business to a grand opening
I hope you make a "hell yeah" for every time you're told "no"
I hope find a hundred dollars the pocket your old coat
I hope you hope you figure out what's been holding you back
I hope you reshape that box you got that boxed you in the past
I hope if you're lost in smoke and broke and hopin', focus back in sight
I hope you get the benefits with minimum of sacrifice
I hope you got the hunger, I hope you got the appetite
I hope your dead favorite relatives, they all come back to life
Hope you don't get one victory, but maybe like three or four
And you get in the door, I hope you sell out arena tours
I hope you meet Beyonc√©, I hope you meet Myles
I met him one time, he wore a shirt that said "SMYL3"
Years later, saw him after, hadn't seen in awhile
Some fellas can be jealous, that's not his style
What he said? He said:

[Pre-Hook: Myles Bullen]
I'm telling you that you're intelligent
Born to spread your benevolence
There's a well of wealth inside you
So find out where you're fortunate
That's where your fortune is
That's where your fortune is

[Hook: Myles Bullen]
I hope you win, I hope you win
I hope you win, I hope you win
