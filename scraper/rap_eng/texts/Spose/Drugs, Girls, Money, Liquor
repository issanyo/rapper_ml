[Intro:]
A couple of things that'll bring a dude down, I'll tell ya in a sec
Uh-Spose, OH, SEVEN
Drugs, girls, money, liquor

[Verse 1:]
Check it out, hey, yo, I'm breaking up prescription drugs on Egyptian rugs
Too blazed to be depicted thugs, blunts like "Huh, huh?"
My Ziplocs used to be in tip top form, like my hip-hop
Then one morn police swarmed the dorm (god damn!)
Warned, but didn't listen, ignored my inhibitions
Was snorin' but they had warrants so now my parents bitchin'
No tuition because of my drug addiction
"Oh Ryan, you lyin'!" Nah, bitch, it's non-fiction
These blondes and brunettes are goddamn ruthless
My wallet's Somalian and starvin', it's quite retarded
Girls, you can't take them out like the garbage
When the dinner costs more than the rent for your apartment
They want diamonds, islands, expensive bottles
I'm like "How about the dollar menu at McDonalds?"
But no girls is on their knees for fries and double cheese
Jeez, at least my right hand will fuck me for free!

[Hook:]
What's it all about?
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm (alright)
As long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
If you feel me say (yeah)
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm (alright)
Cause as long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
(Shut the fuck up!)

[Verse 2:]
Spizzy still unequivocally ill, but no deal
From Wells, like the girl from the ring, but no bling!
No ice like summer, Bank balance a bummer
Call my mom's house, they disconnected my number
I ain't stinkin' rich, but at least I don't stank
Fuck irrational skanks at Ocean National Bank
I'm broke, but still breaking up Garcia Vega
Fiendin' White Castle or Sonic like (SEGA!)
Muchos Cannabis, I'm a blunt analyst
Burritos, Fritos, Cheetos, and a sand-a-wich
I got the munchies, dank smellin' funky
Chunky blunts longer than a candle stick
Hey, I like herbal shit, Percocet, Vicodin
It's like Heineken after Heineken
I freestyle and rhyme again
Also I'm drunk, trying to find 'shrooms
And this slam pigs starting to look like Heidi Klum

[Hook:]
What's it all about?
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm (alright)
As long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
If you feel me say (yeah)
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm (alright)
Cause as long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
(Shut the fuck up!)

[Verse 3:]
And now it's 4 A.M., bag with stems
No honeys, mo money
And this liquor got me feeling crummy, hug me
In a secluded room, or smokin' Buddha
Thrice times booted, find me where the food is
Or-or, studderin' and pukin' shit up
Like-like the second half of 2 Girls 1 Cup - yuck!
Lamented exes or bimpin' sluts
Cause I'm drunk like, "WHAAA-I DON'T GIVE A FUCK"
I'll be wylin', drunk dialin', freestylin'
Zoned out, rocking closed eye-a-lids
Me? I get higher when
I be smokin' out a piece
Like I preach nonviolence
This liquor kicks it with my liver
But fuck that, where the drugs at?
Spizzy uninhibited drinker
Girl, you'll never find Ryan lyin' on the mic
But you might find Ryan high, lyin' on a dyke

[Hook:]
What's it all about?
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm (alright)
As long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
If you feel me say (yeah)
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm (alright)
Cause as long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
(Shut the fuck up!)

[Outro:]

Who got-who got smoke-

Who got-who got smoke-
