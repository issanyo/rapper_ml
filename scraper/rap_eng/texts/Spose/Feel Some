[Chorus: Dave Gutter with Spose]
If I die tonight
Can't say I didn't live my life
Can't say I didn't find sunshine in the blue midnight
Can't say I didn't live my life
Everybody, put my phone in the garbage, tryna feel somethin'
Push your twins on the swings, tryna feel somethin'
Find me sweaty at the show, tryna feel somethin'
I'm not ready to go, tryna feel somethin', feel somethin'

[Verse 1: Spose]
The biggest expense at my funeral will be the DJ
All my favorite songs cut together on replay
Everybody get together, feel awesome
Moose skin draped on my corpse in the coffin
As he played Jay-Z, my gospel
And all the Smashing Pumpkins was bumpin' with Zack [?]
Blackstreet, Keith Sweat, Toni Braxton
I'm loving every minute and am thankful for the fact I've been invented
Lot of people didn't make it, man, I really got the feelin'
Put on Biggie Smalls and everybody spit it, get down

[Chorus: Dave Gutter with Spose]
If I die tonight
Can't say I didn't live my life
Can't say I didn't find sunshine in the blue midnight
Can't say I didn't live my life
Tryna, tryna put my phone in the garbage, tryna feel somethin'
Push your twins on the swings, tryna feel somethin'
Find me sweaty at the show, tryna feel somethin'
I'm not ready to go, tryna feel somethin', feel somethin'

[Verse 2: Spose]
Find me smiling in a horizontal posture
Up in Heaven at the Biggie Smalls, Kurt Cobain joint band concert
Me and Jesus getting back rubs
In a bathtub by a chick with a black glove
What's her name? It's Nicole Brown Simpson
Prince and Jimi Hendrix playing solos in the distance
For Adam, yo, and I'm not even a Christian
Let's talk about if I ever went to Heaven
All my favorite songs playing on the jukebox
Who's that? Audrey Hepburn in a tube top
She was fucking hanging, Michael Jackson on the moonwalk
I was with Aaliyah and my grandma and 2Pac, swear to God
God was like, "Stop swearing at me"
I was like, "God, you're a crusty, old geriatric
So me and David Bowie taking over"
Then right then, somebody tapped me on the shoulder
I turned around, it's my wife and kids
The best thing I ever seen in my life, it's lit
And Heaven is revealed as the 207, really did it
Made it from a sperm to a base to a person
I appreciated my blessings, I count 'em so much, I lost count
I'm already in Heaven right now, get down

[Chorus: Dave Gutter & Spose]
If I die tonight
Can't say I didn't live my life
Can't say I didn't find sunshine in the blue midnight
Can't say I didn't live my life
With the [?] and the [?], tryna feel somethin'
[?], tryna feel somethin'
With the stress and all [?], tryna feel somethin'
When you going for the gold tryna feel somethin', feel somethin'
I'll feel somethin'
With my real ones
