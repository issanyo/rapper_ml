[Intro: Spose and Cam Groves]
Cam Groves!
Yeah! Right!
Pdank!
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh

[Verse: Cam Groves]
Get Em!
I'm whats up girl
They got to ask twice
I'm on the rise now
Like the gas price
I eat Emcees
Then I crap mics
I'm like fabulous
Yeah I'm that nice
Just a slow stoner
Living in a fast life
While you're at home, sober
Boning with your fat wife
On the mic, Shaun White
In a half-pipe
I just tagged your girl
I don't graph right
I'm a problem, like the worst around
Content underground with commercial sound
Live shows so perfect
How I work the crowd
Cam Groves so low
Like the dirt in the ground
My shit's tighter than the pants on hipsters
As a kid I never pictured taking pictures with strippers
Then I'm not a gangster homie, guess again
Been in more handcuffs than fucking S and M
A bunch of punch lines and some bragging rap
I never cut corners like I'm bagging crack
Wells, Maine baby that's my habitat
Got your girl walking funny like she had the crap
Yeah, I'm on some funny shit
Pdank, baby
We'll show you where the money is
Honey laughing, cause she's after me and fascinated
I hit that ass twice
Assassinated
Clap and cheer for my rap career
2011 baby, that's the year
1 ounce of the weed
30 rack of beer
Then we'll wake up in the morning
Like what happened here?
They wish I'd fly
Better wish again
'bout to pop like soda
Up in Michigan
Get it?
They be like, quit bragging kid
I'm on my own dick, like I'm dragging it
My raps are crazy
Practice daily
On some non chalant shit
Laxi-dasiy
Baby, don't be lazy
And pass that JD
And We'll be dirty dancing
Call me Patrick Swayze
Never let another fucking rapper phase me
Won't act as hard as you
However I may be
Not Mr.T
Not rolling with A-Team
Just the homie Spose
And he's running the main scene
I'm never changing
Sicker than gangrene
Decaying the game
Underground to mainstream
I write a whole 16
On the same scheme
Emcees look at me
And then they day dream
Stay clean
No fouls when I play D
Live by 2 words
Fuck you, pay me
Takes more than yellow and blue to make green
So I've hustled everyday since I turned 18
Damage it
Like a vandalist
Name a white rapper
Killing like Cameron is
If Chris Webby comes after me
On your iPod
Than I suggest you download some cannabis
Shit!
I don't care if you're a fan of this
I got tricks homie, watch me land this switch
And I'm 'a keep rapping
Like bandages
Until this money stacks up
Like it sandwiches

[Outro: Cam Groves]
Fucking Right!
Yo-
Still killin' them flows
Still lovin' them hoes
Still killin' them flows
Still lovin' them hoes
Ask Spose
Ask?
Oh, oh, ohhhhh
