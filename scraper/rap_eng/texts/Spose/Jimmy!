[Verse 1]
It was a regular day in junior high for Chris
Same "Hey faggot!" same "Watch out, bitch!"
Same older kids who treated him like shit
Just because he liked computers and he talked with a lisp
(Hey Chrisss!)
They embarrassed him in all ways
Lunch room, gym class, bathroom, hallways, all day
Sometimes it made him wanna die
The fullest of the bullies was this one guy named Jimmy!
A trouble making popular kid
Who humiliated Chris every chance he could get
And this year, Chris skipped ahead two grades in math
To one's delight and one's fright, they're in the same class
Chris went to piss with the bathroom pass
Jimmy took his inhaler out of his book bag
Later in gym he had a asthma attack
When he saw him in the ambulance, Jimmy just laughed
It escalated like stairs that move
Until Jimmy decided that he was too cool for school
Years later, he was doing coke off the floor again
When Chris graduated as the valedictorian

[Verse 2]
He was yawning as he came around the corner
Mumbled talking, looking like a speed walker sorta
Bags under his eyes, days since he slept
Sweat on his brow made his face all wet
His wild eyes fixed on CVS
As he pulled a bandanna up off of his neck
Adjusted something in his over sized jorts
Fiddled with it as he walked up to the door of the store
It was Jimmy! Came here to rob this shit
He had done it a couple times and safely split
His arm swung pale, you could see his arteries
Vile as he's walking down the aisle toward the pharmacy
He surveyed the scene
Only one dude in line as far as he could see
So he grabbed that pistol by the handle part of it
And demanded Oxycontin as he pointed at the pharmacist
Who quickly obliged
Handed over every pill they had on the other side
A pocket full of Oxys as he went to bail
But the next thing he remembers is waking up in jail
(The fuck just happened?)

[Verse 3]
Our homie Chris had a flight that night to Japan
After one interview they said he was their man
He'd be rich within the year
So say "konichiwa" to the head systems engineer
But he's still an asthmatic
So he's at the pharmacy, stocking up for his travels
Waiting in line, he's the only one
And then he sees some dude with a gun, it's fucking Jimmy!
That same bully from school
Who had called him a fag and kicked him in the jewels
What a fool, ooh, retribution would be great
â€˜Cause Chris was in shape, drinking protein shakes
He'd been in the gym through college
While Jimmy graduated onto Oxycontin
So when Jimmy turned around and started walkin'
Chris took a decisive step toward him, there was nothing that could stop him
He scissor-kicked him in the side of the noggin
On some MMA shit, and it instantly dropped him
Minutes later, in came the cops
Chris smirked as the clerk got the blood all mopped
