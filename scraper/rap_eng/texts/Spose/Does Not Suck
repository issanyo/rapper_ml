[Sample of Too $hort's "Cusswords"]
If you ask me what it's all about
I'll say it's about that mon-ay
But if you ask me could you have some
I'll say it doesn't concern me

[Spose]
It goes one for your mother
Two for the face
Then three or four minutes before I get wasted

[Hook]
You can find me ridin' by with the windows down
Shotgun is a case of beer (okay)
'Cause life might suck most of the time
But it does not suck right here (no way)
Come and see me at my house party
Throw your hands in the atmosphere (put 'em up)
'Cause life might suck most of the time
But it does not suck right here (right here)

[Verse]
Nope, I'm feeling fine, I might get wasted
I'm 'bout to chill with some people I don't hate yet
I'm okay 'cause my paycheck's husky
'Cause life's been my bitch and I do it robustly
Alcohol musk, no muscles but I'm dope
[Muffled?] beats since fourteen and never let go
Big shit-eating grin, I'm about to celebrate
I'm U2 - a beautiful day about to elevate
So tell a Dave or a Stephanie
Spose been giving you that 90s hip-hop, Bill Bellamy
I got fans but no chandeliers
Pass a light beer, it does not suck right here

[Hook]
You can find me ridin' by with the windows down
Shotgun is a case of beer (okay)
'Cause life might suck most of the time
But it does not suck right here (no way)
Come and see me at my house party
Throw your hands in the atmosphere (put 'em up)
'Cause life might suck most of the time
But it does not suck right here (right here)
