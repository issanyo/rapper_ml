[Verse 1]
My girl wants to buy a house
But my credit so bad that I couldn't get a loan to buy a couch
I could tell that she's disappointed when I pull the bong out
Letters from the IRS arriving at mom's now
Man, I guess that's just what happens here
Mid-twenties trying to salvage a rap career
Skip doing taxes to grab a beer, haven't worked out in like half a year
Sleep past the aurora, don't give an iota
Can't afford the aioli, no heart beat how my aorta
I gotta stop this shit and be prosperous like a pamphlet, brochure
Because my predicament, it's sickenin', it's gruesome like a growth spurt
On this road to ruin, I don't see no stop sign
But this car works and I'm not dead and it's sunrise, so I got time because

[Hook]
Now's not too late
To start fresh today
So I could stop living a lie
And I could start living alive
Now's not too late
To start fresh today
So I could stop living a lie
And I could start living alive

[Verse 2]
It's not too late
If it was, I'd give up right now but I could do a lot today
I could quit it all cold turkey and I could make a hot souffl√©
You see, fate is in my pinchers
I could reach far like timbers or get feet charred by cinders
But I'm living a lie, living a lie
Will I win or lose? That's up for me to decide
I'm not infallible, nope, I'm the sum of my flaws
And I know my future's as malleable as gum in my jaws
And I know each day is valuable, so I'm taking my chances
My insight is that you can't get enlightened from lampin'
Even if you've been wrong all your life, you could still get shit right
If you're not at death and you got one breath then you could still see the light
I'm pulling over on the bridge, I see a kid
The look in his eyes says, "I don't wanna live"
Then I hop out of the whip and I walk through the traffic
He says, "I can't do it" and then I looked right at him, I told him

[Hook]
"Now's not too late
To start fresh today
So I could stop living a lie
And I could start living alive
Now's not too late
To start fresh today
So I could stop living a lie
And I could start living alive"

[Verse 3]
Look back at the path, are there puddles of blood?
And lakes of tears in the tracks?
Is there darkened perspiration in the nook of your arm? If not
I expect to see a look of alarm, because you haven't been tryin'
You've been maxin' 'n' slackin', you've been roastin' 'n' coastin'
You've been chillin', buildin' sandcastles next to the ocean
Man, the seas are risin', I see a diseased horizon
You're gonna be ghost up in that moat if we don't see you flyin'
Everything is swell up in your cerebellum
You make so many excuses that it's too bad you can't sell 'em
You roll out like a dice game, when the fight came
Opportunities missed like a light rain
You worry 'bout the future while you live in the past
I know it's lonely at the top plus the middle is packed
So what I like to do, is trudge from the morning till the night is through, in my hikin' boots
And they grip and grind and they slip and slide but every day, my height is new
I'm telling you

[Hook]
Now's not too late
To start fresh today
So I could stop living a lie
And I could start living alive
Now's not too late
To start fresh today
So I could stop living a lie
And I could start living alive
