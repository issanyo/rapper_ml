[Chorus]
I'm way better with people who I don't know
If you've ever been close to me then I know you know
I will let you down, I'll let you down
I'll disappoint you, hold my beer

[Break]
I never had a girlfriend who I didn't disappoint

[Verse 1]
Shane said I'm a dick and my wife agreed
I make people wanna leave when they're close to me
Friendships in ruins like the Mayans
But they love me at the drive-thru when I drive in
Ryan J. said that he doesn't think I work hard enough
And I was pissed at him but maybe he's right
I've been jealous of Cam, tried to one-up him
He bought a camera so I bought the next model up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I know I'm like this
But the trash guy thinks that I'm the nicest
All my old friends think that I'm ISIS
I'm a victim of all of my vices

[Chorus]
I will let you down, I'll let you down
I'll disappoint you, hold my-
I'm way better with people who I don't know
If you've ever been close to me then I know you know
I will let you down I'll let you down
I'll disappoint you hold my beer

[Verse 2]
She said, "You're so arrogant, there's many witnesses"
But I helped an old lady carry her conditioners
She think that I'm chivalrous, but if you ask my homies
She gon probably end up hating me if she had got to know me
Interrupted while they're speaking, man no wonder they abhor me
Always talking over people tryna tell my better story
I'm nice to all the special needs kids and good with children
But anybody who has been with me has left the building

[Chorus]
I will let you down I'll let you down
I'll disappoint you, hold my beer

[Bridge]
I will let you down down down
Down down down
Down down, down down down
I will let you down down down
Down down down
Down down, down down down
Will you be my best friend?
I don't got a best friend
Will you be my best friend tonight?

[Break]
I've never had a girlfriend who I didn't disappoint

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, I don't know why I'm like this
But my mail lady thinks that I'm the nicest
All my old friends think that I'm ISIS
They're victims of all of my vices

[Chorus]
I will let you down I'll let you down
I'll disappoint you, hold my beer
