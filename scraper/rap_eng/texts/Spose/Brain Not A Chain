[Hook: Spose]
Came in the game with a brain, not a chain
Went against the grain, left Maine on a plane
Sunny days came and I made it through the rain
Proclaimed I would attain till the day they know my motherfucking-
Came in the game with a brain, not a chain
Sunny days came and I made it through the rain
Went against the grain, left Maine on a plane
Proclaimed I would attain till the day they know my motherfucking name!

[Verse 1: Spose]
I was the broseph looking toasted like a pop-tart
Slumming in a Sox hat, who turned in a pop star
Whoops! Kept a couple thousand in the sock drawer
Lit up like a cop car, smoked it all, bought more
Look pal, I've been preposterously dank, ridiculously dope
Maybe monstrously lame but meticulously flow, come and get a whiff of Spose
Smells like Wells, Maine, nights up in the cove
I'm not a fighter, just a writer, put the lighter to the bowl!
Always knew that it was do or die
I'm doing work while you're hanging like a suicide
I just Googled the meaning of annuitize
Which stupid guys' rhymes you bumped in lieu of mine?!
Who am I? Spose, motherfucker!
P. Dank to the top like a fat kid to supper
So tell your brother's mother, "Ain't shit changed"
Same since the fame, still, sexy as John McCain
Since I-

Came in the game with a brain, not a chain
Sunny days came and I made it through the rain
Went against the grain, left Maine on a plane
Proclaimed I would attain till the day they know my motherfucking name!

[Verse 2: Spose]
Fuck your Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
We'll be smashing in the fender, take a blender to your Fendi
Yelling obscenities in the mezzanine, P. Dank
Defenders of the peasantry, who surprised pleasantly
Guys who thought rap was crack, gats and Hennessy
So yeah, Bethany, you can put your ass away
Quick like Nestle, I acquired accolades
Stripes like a referee, I earned 'em â€˜cause I had to say
What I really had instead of brags
They're yelling, "No you're not, dude don't lie!" when I pass
7 million YouTube views in the bag
Cop had me stopped just to get my autograph
But they still don't respect me, I'm as sexy as a scab
You could grovel for the models, you could wallow for the cash
Fuck that, learn facts till you need a bigger hat
So, yeah, mane, we're not the same
If you're unbejewled then tell your mom, "P. Dank"
So we-

[Verse 3: Cam Groves]
You know it's Groves, the flow's so tight
Shout-out to Spose, man, I owe him my life
And I remember back when he told me, "Keep rappin' "
Look at all that happened since "John Madden"
In Salt Lake when he signed the deal
Then I packed up my bags, got behind the wheel
Hear my tires squeal, away we go
And on the way home, who's on the radio?
(Motherfucker, I'm awesome)
Welcome to the music life
With the Jet Blue flights and on the news at night
When it comes to picking cards, gotta choose 'em right
Because this music life is an amusement ride
Ever since a kid, yo, the flows were mean
Big dreams, whenever me and Spose convened
We were plotting on our way to expose the scene
And now we on the road, two shows a week
I would sit in the studio and roll that weed
And write to a beat till I go to sleep
It's the M to the A to the I-N-E
More pine trees further than that I can see, yeah
I'm that rap guy coming through your Cat-5
P. Dank baby, triple clap when we slap five
Remember back when rap was a pass time?
Now we pack heads every time we rap live
Late night writing down a song
Got the proudest mom when the crowd respond
And we trying to make it large, coming from a small town
P. Dank in the building until it falls down
Bitch
