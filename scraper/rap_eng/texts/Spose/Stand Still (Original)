[Verse 1: Cam Groves]
I'm from a spot where you don't have to worry about
Getting shot, much less getting robbed
As a kid, more money more problems
Was just my excuse not to get a job
I never finished college, just a high school scholar
Never be a baller, making blue collar dollars
Holler if you're not into gangs or gun busting
You sell crack, I work construction, who's hustling?
Pass the dutch son, and let me take a breath
Of battle MC's scared of me like they fakin' death
Take a step back, let me kick a flow
Been doing it since fifth grade, working on my pick and roll
I'm so real you could put me on a fishin' pole
Kids biting me like they motherfucking pickerel
I got the sickest flow, until my plan fail
You can find Cam on his grind like a handrail

[Hook: Cam Groves]
Stand still, I got skill
Trying to make some scrill, gotta pay my bills
Stand still, like I was robbing a Key Bank
Rolling down the street tank, listening to P. Dank
Still I remain, staying true
No gang playing, gotta pay my dues
And still, there ain't no doubt man
Keep shooting for those stars, I'll be climbing up this mountain

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
It's been a dream of mine not only to rap
But to redefine on why we read these lines
I'm from the streets that be free of crime
And got at least a million motherfucking trees to climb
I only rap for the peace of mind
The cheese and wine have never been my reasons why
Nowadays a rapper with some decent rhymes
Ain't exactly what I consider an easy find
Just because sagging jeans is a steez of mine
Don't make me a gangster or a G, nor tried
In fact, I'm a weed smoking peaceful guy
Doesn't mean I'm the type with a feeble spine
If advice is what you need, then I have to say:
"Always look back on what you leave behind"
But enough with those e's and i's, I'ma hit sixteen
Drop the mic and say, "Peace, good night"

[Hook: Cam Groves]
Stand still, I got skill
Trying to make some scrill, gotta pay my bills
Stand still, like I was robbing a Key Bank
Rolling down the street tank, listening to P. Dank
Still I remain, staying true
No gang playing, gotta pay my dues
And still, there ain't no doubt man
Keep shooting for those stars, I'll be climbing up this mountain
