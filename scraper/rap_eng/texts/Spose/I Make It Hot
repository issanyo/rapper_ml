[Chorus 1]
I make it hot, like DJ Jazzy Jeff
And Fresh Prince in the summertime
I make it hot like, like Nelly
Damn, it's gettin' hot in here
I make it hot like legs
Stickin' to the shorts and the underwear in summertime
I make it hot like humans with factories and gas
Fillin' up the ozone layer

[Verse 1]
'round here I make it hot, so excruciatingly hot
Everybody try to not die
I make it hot like humans in a room with the door closed
Breathin' out carbon dioxide
I make it hot, it's irrefutable
You'd be foolish to have doubted that, that's about a fact
'cause every mornin', I wake up, I start a billion cars
And run 'em 'til they're out of gas, then fill 'em up again
I make it hot like potato skins with bacon bits
I make it hot like naked chicks
I make it hot like nine-seven
I make it hot like today's temp times infinity, with high humidity
You can't get rid of me, what's that? I'm here, bitches
This oil [?] this oil barrel, come here, children
While the oil drip, drip in the dirt
I make it hot like Hell, but here on Earth
I raise the fahrenheit and celsius, 'til it fucks with the seas
Like me, and then they rise
Like my friend, Shane's, name, like Lil Wayne's third album
(What's that?) 500 Degreez
I make it hot 'til it, 'til it smells like sparks
I make it hot 'til the ice caps melt like hearts
I make it hot like a five-layered dress with a corset
Make it hot 'til the beach is at your doorstep

[Chorus 2]
I make it hot, like gunshots and gunwounds
Guns after shootin' people, ah!
I make it hot, like microwaves and macrowaves
And toaster ovens and ovens, oh shit
I make it hot, like, like a fourth floor apartment
With no AC, eighty degrees out
I make it hot, like my rhymes
But this is a song about global warming

[Verse 2]
I make it hot, like you walk outside
And you instantly start sweatin', you're like, "Oh, damn it!"
I make it hot like you're in a space shuttle
Lookin' for compatible replacement planets
I make it hot like the factory in China where they make shirts
I make it hot like I hate Earth
I make it hot like I hate my children
I make it hot like barrel bombs dropped on civilians
Out in Syria, you're hearin' the truth (I make it hot)
I make it hotter than it is right here in the booth
With sweat drippin' to my forehead, creatin' a reservoir on my eyebrows
Then drippin' into my eyes and stingin' 'em
'til Big Ben's pokin' out of the water
The English Channel overcomin' both France and England
Carnival Cruises had better build another Noah's Ark

[Chorus 3]
'cause I make it hot like flames risin' out the floorboards
World war, go outside to our designated spot
I make it hot like my wife on a Saturday night
When we got a babysitter, God damn
I make it hot like my laptop on my lap at the beach
And my feet on the blacktop, ah!
I make it hot like humans in cars on the highway
Parked, but the gas still comin' out the back, I make it hot

[Verse 3]
It's an LA mornin' with the carbon risin' off of Sunset
Can't tell if it's sunrise or sunset
"What's the sun, Dad?" That's what my son said
I make it hot like everywhere I go
How fast I destroyed this planet, it's a miracle
No icebergs left to kill DiCaprio
How far can a polar bear swim?
How far can a polar bear swim?
Who's gonna drink the Coca-Cola in the Christmas commercial
When the polar bear's gone extinct?
Who cares, I make it hot
Hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot, hot
Hot hot, hot hot hot, it's too hot

[Bridge]
Hot (countdown, ten)
Smoke stacks in the sky, it was like (nine)
We've been parked in the same spot since it was (eight)
Drillbit hit the bedrock around (seven)
Frackin' tryna get to the six-six (six)
Make it hot like Jennifer Aniston, nine (four)
Everybody panic and they head for the hills
In (three, two, one)
"But you forgot about five," no, no, five died, it was too hot
Sweat drippin' off his legs, sweated through his tube socks
"We Didn't Start the Fire" playin' on the boombox
It was hot and deadly like Las Vegas for 2Pac

[Outro]
We just don't get human breaks to the finish
Ay, it's like we just don't get it, ay, ay
I make it hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot, hot
Hot hot, hot hot hot, hot hot, hot, hot
