[Hook]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, this one's for the kids
Oh yeah, oh yeah, so I'm not gonna say sh-
Or fu-, or any words you can't say kindergarten
All my six year-olds here getting started
This that one you can play in the car without having to turn the swears down
You don't need a radio edit, this is the radio edit, it's right here now
I am tired of the fresh beat, banned songs
So I had to make that "bump it in the van" song

[Verse 1]
Backseat, how you feel, how you feel now? (Woo!)
Let's hit Wendy's, hit McDonald's, happy meal now (Woop)
We'll get the toy you want so bad
But I know like in a month, I'ma be throwing that toy out
Man, it's sort of divine
Riding 'round with a six year-old sort-of-a mind
Let's watch Frozen for the hundred-fortieth time
And pretend we're still shocked when Hans is a bad guy
(Spoiler alert!) This the moms' and the dads' rhymes
(Tuck it in the shirt) Let's sing along in the Dodge
Like your daughter learned every word to Nicki Minaj
That she heard on the radio, way to go
This is for the moms in the front seat (front seat)
Coupons, on her way to buy lunch meat (I see you, mom!)
I know you're at the park with your daughter nowadays
But you still know every word to "Forgot About Dre"

[Hook]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, this one's for the kids
Oh yeah, oh yeah, so I'm not gonna say sh-
Or fu-, or any words you can't say in the first grade
All my two year-olds go, "It's your birthday!"
This that one you can play in the car without having to turn the swears down
You don't need a radio edit, this is the radio edit, it's right here now

[Verse 2]
We're not there yet, are we? If you playing Barbies
Listening to Barney, we gon' throw a party
'til we're scanning Arnies from Cameron to Carly
If you're in a car seat, put your sippy cups in the air right now
Throw the food on the floor a little more, in the high chair right now
Crayons on the door if you don't care right now
I know sometimes I spit it explicit
Sticker on my CD from all my elicit linguistics
I'm tryin' to fix it, I guess that is mainly what this is
So I won't say the A word, the B word
The C word, the D word, the E word, the F word
Eliminate the guess work so you could drive a while
Couple miles with your hands off the dial
You know I got your back, mom, if you like rap songs
But you don't like when your kid says [motherfucker]

[Hook]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, this one's for the kids
Oh yeah, oh yeah, so I'm not gonna say sh-
Or fu-, or any words you can't say kindergarten
All my six year-olds here getting started
This that one you can play in the car without having to turn the swears down
You don't need a radio edit, this is the radio edit, it's right here now
I am tired of the fresh beat, banned songs (Sorry Twist)
So I had to make that "bump it in the van" song
This that one you can play in the car without having to turn the swears down (Turn it up!)
You don't need a radio edit, this is the radio edit, it's right here now

[Outro: Spose, Jerry, (other kid), everyone]
First grade
(Forget it, Jerry! That's my line, not yours)
(Shut up, Kayla. So eat it, get it, Jerry)
Shout out to Bridget, shout out to May
Shout out to Lily and Daisy and Cal
I be in the place right now
Say, "Ah yeah!"
Ah, yeah!
Say, "Ah yeah!"
Ah, yeah!
Say, "Bleep!"
Bleep!
Say, "Bleep!"
Bleep!
Ah, yeah!
You don't need a radio edit, it's right here now
Ah, yeah!
Say, "Turkey burgers"
Turkey burgers
Get it, Jerry!
(Get it, Jerry! And that's mine)
