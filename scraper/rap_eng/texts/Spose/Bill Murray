[Intro]
Let's go
And we smoked it all again
We smoked it all once, twice, motherfuckers
And we smoked it all again

[Chorus]
It's the high dudes, Thai food, simmer grilled curry
Ain't shaved in a month, face still furry
I got no real worries, eyes still blurry
Same shit every day like my name's Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Like my name Bill Murray
Ain't shaved in a month, now my face still furry
Same shit every day like my name's Bill Murray

[Verse 1: Spose]
Man I'm still feeling jubilant, still watching Jeopardy
You still could find a Heineken embedded in my recipe
Still getting revenue for spitting recitations
My music making tranquility out of trepidation
Still the P. Dank owner, not dressing like a grownup
Still, spend a couple grand a year at Dunkin Donuts
Still slept on, do I gotta yell louder?
Got bars like I'm standing on the top of cell towers
Still elated to be faded, hated, they even debated
‘Cause I'm Awesome earlier, it's all gone
Still, the funky mother fucker taking brownies out the tupper
Reading Game of Thrones instead of making songs
‘Cause they don't love us in the Parliament
Nor the Senate, nor the House, or the President
So we're still, here, to represent
For anybody who ain't got no representative

[Chorus]
You're rocking with some high dudes, Thai foods, simmer grilled curry
Ain't shaved in a month, face still furry
I got no real worries, eyes still blurry
Same shit every day like my name's Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Like my name Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Same shit every day like my name Bill Murray

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
I'm getting better with age, writing new song patterns
Still hit the stage in the blue John Madden
Still in the booth giving truth on rapping
Still slept on like your futon's flattened
Still high when I jot a verse, son
Been at it every day since we dropped the first one
[?] records what I got in person
You thought I was soft getting shot with Nerf guns
Still blaze, nowadays drink more beer
Change ain't my thing, same J's for four years
Still hungry, need something to eat
And my armpits got more funk than the beat
Every day repetitive, rolling up the sedative
Mr. Nice Guy, always high and benevolent
Same sea breeze, treats for days
It's the same CG, nah the steeze ain't changed

[Chorus]
It's the high dudes, Thai food, simmer grilled curry
Ain't shaved in a month, face still furry
I got no real worries, eyes still blurry
Same shit every day like my name's Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Like my name Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Bill Murray

[Outro]
Bill Murray
Bill Murray
Shaved in a month and my face (Bill Murray)
