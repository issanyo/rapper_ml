Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

[Verse 1: MC Lars]
Pokémon Go, can't stop when I see 'em
Got kicked out the Holocaust museum
Searching for that Squirtle and that Pikachu
But now I haven't had a bath in a week or two
Monday on the subway, epic fail
Saw one on the tracks, down by the third rail
Hogging all my data through AT&T
Phone bill last week was at least seven G's
Found a dead body in the stream by my house
Another homie looking for a Pokémon and drowned
Escape to the past, I'm a 90's kid
IPhone to my face like a giant squid
Grandma's funeral, staring at the screen
Saw one in the casket, heard my Mom scream
Gotta catch 'em all, won't stop till I'm done
I play it when I drive ’cause it's so much fun

[Hook: MC Lars & Spose]
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! (Pokémon!)
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! (Ayup)

[Verse 2: Spose]
I got fired from my job, I was busy hunting Pokémon
Walked into a tree? Now I got a broken arm
I was on my way to march against what the police'll do
But then I got distracted, I was looking for a Pikachu
Got a call from my sister, said my Mom died
Told her I'd have to call her back, ‘cause I'm trying to get up to level 5
I'll be walking, heat or snow or lightning in the forecast
I'll be swimming through a flood if I could get a Snorlax
Pokémon alerts, got me jumping out of bed now
Man I lost my dog but, I also lost ten pounds
(Pokémon, Pokémon Go!)
Will I catch 'em all, man, I just don’t know
But I missed my wedding, I was out here getting
Rare Pokémon behind the convenience store
A PokéStop was a restaurant
And it's on fire and there's smoke involved
But I stayed inside and I died
‘Cause I need to get more Poké Balls
I'm Pokémoning while drivin'
It's okay, I got insurance, I just ran into a tourist
Caught a Pokémon when he was dyin'
I don't eat, don't sleep and my phone goes beep
Saw an old lady getting mugged, I was about to help
But these Pokémon across the street ain't gonna catch themselves!

[Hook: MC Lars]
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Pokémon, Pokémon Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

[Outro: MC Lars, Spose, Both]
Global warming destroying the planet
Who cares, bro? Pokemon Go!
Little kids homeless, starving and famished
Who cares, bro? Pokemon Go!
Donald Trump might actually be the president
Who cares, bro? Pokemon Go!
They kill black dudes, there's video evidence
Who cares, bro? Pokemon Go!
The government is reading all of your texts and emails
Who cares, bro? Pokemon Go!
In Afghanistan, there's no school for females
Who cares, bro? Pokemon Go!
You can buy an AR-15 on the Internet
Who cares, bro? Pokemon Go!
They tricked everybody under 40 into debt
Who cares, bro? Pokemon Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Could we stop making this song now?
I'm tryna get some fucking Pokémon
