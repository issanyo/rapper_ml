[Hook]
Back down
I won't back down
I know they wanna see me back down
I won't back down (back down)
Never back down
I know they wanna see me back down (wanna see me)
Back down, aye
They wanna pull me back down (back down)
I wo- I wo- I won't back down
Back down (back down)
Never never back down
I never never never never never never never never

[Verse]
I'm Tom Petty, stand up
In hell, make it heaven (hold up)
They put up gates like Bill, like Kevin (it's too hot)
They thought I might chill, might quit it
What you drinking, NyQuil? I still might get it
Back down
Cause quitting, that's more common than conscious rap
Quitting, that's the reason that our aunts are fat
Quitting, I won't fold like a laundromat
I'm coming for the summit running, never fucking coming back down
And when I reach it, the beacon
Shit I won't keep it, I'll teach it
I'll tell the people my secrets, I wanna
Raise a glass full of beer for my people still here
Vertebrae's in the air if you never back down

[Hook]
I won't back down
I know they wanna see me back down
I'll never back down, aye
I won't back down
I know you wanna see me back down
We'll never back down
They wanna pull me back down
I know they wanna pull me back down
But I'll never back down (back down)
I'll never never back down
I'll never never never never never never never never

[Verse]
I'll never back down
Even if I'm doing crunches
You could give me one dollar watch me turn it to a hundred
Everybody at the top, best alert 'em that I'm coming
Actually, shh, don't tell 'em that I'm coming
Oh no
That's him yonder, Maine monster at concerts
Who isn't Christian, but make a population ponder
How he lost a record deal and came back stronger
From the top floor, said I'm coming back down
Cause my people on the ground
I'm like a steeple in a town
I'm allegorically metaphorically what it means to stand up
After getting smacked down we're going up and never coming back down

[Hook]
I won't back down
I know they wanna see me back down
I won't back down [?]
Never back down
I know they wanna see me back down (ayup)
Wanna see me back down, aye
They wanna pull me back down
I wo- I wo- I won't back down, never (background)
Back down
Never never back down
I'll never never never never never never never never back down

[Verse]
Man if I finish this song now, and said it was my favorite
And then I put it out and everybody hated it
And then I dropped an album, nobody went to get it
And I lost all twenty thousand that I had invested, I back-
Fuck no, back at it, yes harder
Get smarter in the limo with Timbo and S. Carter
That's my goal
I would bet every dollar in my cash flow that I could (get down) and (get up)
You know that that Spose never bitter
A winner, I go from cash to cash cow
Never quitting, my kids are getting big in the background
This my office, my profits are all invested that's how
P. Dank to the top, never coming back down

[Hook]
I won't back down
I know they wanna see me back down
I won't back down
Never back down
I know they wanna see me back down (ayup)
Wanna see me back down, aye
They wanna pull me back down
I wo- I wo- I won't back down, never (background)
Back down
Never never back down
I'll never never never never never never never never back down

[Outro]
Even when it all falls down
I never back down
I get up
Ayup
