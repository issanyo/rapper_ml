[Verse 1: Spose]
The first time I got arrested
I was higher than the gas price
5-0 rolled with some flashlights, that's life
I was in cuffs laughing, laughing
Like, "Whatever homie, you know bullshit happens"
And I swore, man, that would be the last time
Crime can't become a pastime of mine, nah
But a month later cops busted through the locked door
And found a QP up in the sock drawer
And now I'm four charges deep, can't sleep
And you know plus, I ain't got laid in 3 weeks
Straight depressed, no checks
Mic cable round my neck, like I'll chill with the devil
What the heck, no sweat
I'm going mental and I'm chattering my dentals
'Cause these teachers used to tell me I had so much potential
But now
Shut down
Smoker, alcoholic
Life's rotten, got me plottin' on droppin' up out of college
Deuce court dates in late May
Just great
Can't wait to get substantially financially raped
Man, I used to be invincible
Like, "fuck you" to the principle
But now I'm not sensible
God damn!

[Hook]
God damn
Right when they cuff my hands
God damn
When I testify or take the stand
God damn
I seriously can't afford this, man
God damn
It's got me scheming on a master plan

[Verse 2: Spose]
So, yo, I rolled into court (When?)
Rooster o'clock (oh) in two different socks
Mad bitches with speeding tickets was kicking it
The courtroom was crickets
My heart's pounding like the bass in your Civic
And I'm tripping like, "please have mercy on my soul
I mean I only had a weed-filled bowl
Oh no!"
Misdemeanors got my mom reaching for Kleenex
And I don't want my dad to know
So yo, it's like
God damn as they call me to the stand
And I entered the chamber like the Wu-Tang Clan
I plead my case but the judge barely budge
I've been trudged through the mud since I met my boy Drugs
I realize I've gotta Nip/Tuck my ways
I ain't Dave Chapelle
Rick James, rich bitch, hey
I gotta rearrange priorities
And even more importantly and horribly
Ease off the Heinekens and forestry
'Cause back when I had lights up on my sneakers
I was eager to be a leader with my voice up on the speakers
But now I'm losing confidence
A life no longer positive
I mean I wasn't conscious of the consequence
Bumming, I was like off the wall like paint chips
Not thinking, drinking, banging, endangering, and feeling anguish
Slipping as a convict
Tripping taking bong rips
And doing all the wrong shit, God damn!

[Second Hook]
God damn
Right when they cuffed my hands
God damn
When I testified or took the stand
God damn
I seriously couldn't afford this man
God damn
It had me scheming on a master plan

[Verse 3: Spose]
So yo it's been two years now
I ain't completely stop
Weed-stinking, beer-drinking
I don't fuck with the cops, nah
I mellowed out
I'm more intelligent now
As apposed to the old Spose up in the felony crowd
It's like, fuck that
I cut back a lot, for sure
I'm hanging in there like nuts sacks in boxer shorts
I'm not going to court
I'm still repping F-4s
Still Spizzy Spizzy Spose
Baby, catch me on tour
God damn
