[Intro]
Cousin too
Going down a road in Maine

[Verse]
I was at Dunkin' Donuts the other day, my phone vibrate
I pulled it out my Bullhead jeans and said, "Hey"
All were involved, it was a conference call
With both my managers and one of 'em asked me if I was standin' up
I replied, "Nah, I'm sittin' in the whip
Waiting on this iced coffee so I could take a sip"
And the other one asked if I had a minute
I could tell something serious was coming from their lips
Meanwhile, at the drive-thru
The cashier's eyes encountered my two, she recognized
Local celebrity, "Hi dude," to whom no one is similar
They freaked out a little bit and asked me for my signature
And simultaneously, they had cut to the chase
On the phone they talked to M. Ron, and they
They, meaning Universal Republic
Had decided Spizzy Spose was a artist they were done with
... I'm like, "Huh?"
That single blowed up
I mean, M. Ron still has that plaque with gold dust
We did 16,000 in Syracuse, they showed up
And they were all chanting, go us
Later they gave us free weed that we broke up, I mean
Lyrically everything I've done was cold stuff
I thought the record was sewed up, it was coming out, no ifs and no buts
I mean we had John lay the dope cuts
I made the verse so tough, every track we made was robust
Fucking ill-ass shit, that cold cut
... "So what?"
That night, Dustin told me that he left the band
I left band practice then and I texted Cam
I went home and talked to my girl and my daughter
I sketched a epitaph on the pen and pad and laughed

[Hook]
Me and you
Mark Curdo, Spencer Albee too
And that record label on the eighth floor
Got me still slamming Nissan doors
Me and you
M. Ron and Monte Lipman too
And the record label on the eighth floor
I don't really fuck with them no more
Me and you
My girl and my daughter too
We gon' be alright fo' sho'
Even if we in them Volvo doors
Me and you
Cam Groves and my whole damn crew
P. Dank, we gon' be alright
We could ride from the morn' till the night

[Outro]
For anything else that year but that song right there
Because it started here
That is, uh, I just need to check the facts on this thing
But, uh, I'm still thinking that that is probably the biggest song ever to come out of the state of Maine
Over 800,000 copies of that single have been sold since 2010
And it all started right here, on a show I'm very honored to host called Spinout
First time it ever got played, and uh, the first people to support that guy, um, was WCYY and Spinout
And uh, that's how he launched, and what happened was unreal
Major label deal, major label bone heads
Major label deal and uh, he's got a song that is getting close towards a million copies sold
Unbelievable, and he's so much more than that song
Spose with "I'm Awesome"
Spose actually about to put out I think his fourth release here, before Christmas
Four records, just this year alone
Unreal man, he don't need no, friggin' big label
It was a nice moment
I was lucky to spend a lot of time with him throughout that year and travel
Um, with him throughout the year and seeing amazing things
And he always brought the spotlight back to Maine
And always brought it back to this radio station for giving him the opportunity and launching him
The launch pad worldwide for Spizzy Spose, right here, WCYY
So cheers to Wells, Maine, and cheers to all the P. Dank family and friends out there
What an awesome thing, man
