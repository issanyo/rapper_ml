[Intro]

[Verse]

Stand still like a statue, snowflake tattoo
Fast Food Pabst Blue Cam Groves that's who
I rap dude, got the cashews to back it up
Slim pickings, been spitting like I'm Daffy Duck
Call me old fashion, going go get my crap done
I'm half gone, trying to write a rap song
Got a good buzz and I'm hoping that it lasts long
Picturing your sister strap on-ing with your fat mom
Dagone I just did it again kid, offensive, ah shit look what my pen did
I write rhymes that will strain your brain and that'll move crowds like a bus, plane, or train
Dang, Wells, Maine this fly, baby why, cuz I've been live since I arrived in '85
Not a ladies guy, girl I'm not a heart-throb and even though they call it giving brain it ain't a smart job

[Outro]
