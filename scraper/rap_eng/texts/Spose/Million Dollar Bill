[Intro]
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill

[Verse 1]
Until I got swamp ass dampening my Levis
Working in the moonlight, silhouetted, trying to get it perfect
In a lab coat, beakers overflowing, I'm determined
Flickers on the wet walls, candle wax burning
In a catacomb cellar writing tighter than a virgin
Looseleaf Einstien wrote in broken German
Immersed in my work, servants in the hall
Too nervous to disturb him, he might turn into a jerk
I got the shortest fuse, but the fortitude to prove I made it
Concentrated like I'm orange juice
Until they've all discovered him or I'm bald and bumbling
I will scrawl on these walls, keep my cauldron bubbling
I shriek, "Eureka!" in the night and it echoes in the hills
When I think, ink trembles in the quills
Resilient, till I'm the one civilians wanna kill
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill

[Hook]
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
Someday I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill

[Verse 2]
I told my boss this morning I'm not gonna be back
So I won't need the shifts I would normally have
My only source of income is gonna be rap
Because I want it like women don't wanna be fat
My mom can keep her car, I would normally ask
But I'm gonna turn my normal into Porsches and cash
With disproportionate portions of populations of people
Partaking proudly in the practice of pushing my tracks
Humongous, pockets looking obese
Flipping through photographs, laughing at the old me
Wallet full of cheese, stuffed like pierogies, raviolis
Dictionaries adding words like "Sposey," or "Bimpin," or "D.Y.D."
Until villages of children wanna be like me
Until I got crowns and whole towns to leave in my will
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill

[Hook]
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
Someday I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill

[Verse 3]
There's some cats who say that I've already done enough
I say, "Fuck that," I haven't even made a million bucks
I would rather kick the bucket than slum it with runners up
So I'm jizzing on your shingles, still: I'm coming up
Until I'm bigger than Jesus, bigger than wrestling
Bigger than Bieber, bigger than sexting
Bigger than the Internet and cigarettes combined
You can doubt it in your mind but I'm sure of it in mine
God damn it, rhyme divine, borderline messianic
All humility aside, the illest on the planet
If I didn't think that, I wouldn't keep ranting
Stay sharp like Shannon till the day that I vanish
I'm a man with a canvas, plans outlandish
More bread than a club sandwich
I got no amulets glaring, I'm just sharing my skills
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill

[Hook]
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
Someday I'ma stop trying to borrow your car
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
So mom, I promise, I'm gonna be large
Until they put my face on a million dollar bill
