[Spose and (The Danks)]
[sexual groans to the beat]
(Hey, ooh)
Don't stop, can't stop
Spizzy Spose in the house
We're gonna sex it out for you if you don't mind
Let me tell you, girl
I like my sex by myself (I like my sex by myself)
I like that shit with no help (I like that shit with no help)
And if you like the rhymes I brang
Then sing along with the Danks
I like my sex by myself (I like my sex by myself)
You like your sex with Michael Phelps (I like my sex with Michael Phelps)
And if you like the rhymes I brang
Then sing along with the Danks
(Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, oh, oh)

[Verse 1: Spose]
Well I was sitting at my mom's dreaming about paychecks with loot
My girlfriend's boobs, and how to smoke legal like Snoop (Oops)
I'm interrupted by a door knock
It is 4:18, who the hell is this?
I get up quick, tuck my dick
I stop Drew from barkin', I get to Chris walking
It's a face that I've seen before
It's Mike George, we both graduated class of '04
I look deeper, he's got trees, maybe beasters
And in his fist: Backwoods and a Bic
That's that shit, Michael, are you jokin' or smokin'?
He tells me that we got two minutes to get it tokin'
420 on the digital, this is pivotal
'Cause I'm broke as fuck and I enjoy being a criminal
Right before this happened, I was sitting here rapping
Watching YouTube booty-clapping, PS2 action, playing:

[Hook: The Danks and (Spose)]
John Madden, John-John Madden
John Madden, John-John Madden
(Now switch it up)
Tony Hawk, y'all
Tony Hawk, y'all
Tony Hawk, y'all
No money, no money money money
No money, no money money money
(I blazed and played John Madden when I got up)
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
You know it's Groves cause the flow is so tight
I got instrumentals downloaded, mobile device
Just in case I want to kick it, take a go at the mic
I'm hot as hell even though Maine's colder than ice
Yeah, what you make in a week, I'll be folding it twice
It doesn't matter what the numbers even show on the price
I'm always taking chances like I'm rolling the dice
And I used to push the ganja from an O to a slice
But I'm learning more as I grow older in life
It's not about how many punches that you throw in the fight
It's about why you throw 'em and if you're throwing 'em right
And always make those good goals and try to hold 'em in sight
And even though I get high, take control of the flight
It doesn't mean it's wrong, if you don't know it is right
Been into rap since way back when rollin' on bikes
And from that day rap happened to take control of my life, playing

[Hook: The Danks and (Spose)]
John Madden, John-John Madden
John Madden, John-John Madden
(Now switch it up)
Tony Hawk, y'all
Tony Hawk, y'all
Tony Hawk, y'all
No money, no money money money
No money, no money money money
(We blazed and played John Madden when we got up)
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?

(Where was you brought up?)
Wells, Maine
(Where was you brought up?)
Wells, Maine
(Where was you brought up?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, baby, baby, come on, we're playin'

[Hook: The Danks and (Spose)]
John Madden, John-John Madden
John Madden, John-John Madden
(Now switch it up)
Tony Hawk, y'all
Tony Hawk, y'all
Tony Hawk, y'all
No money, no money money money
No money, no money money money
(No money, no money money money)
( blazed and played John Madden when I got up)
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?

(Damn, girl)
