[Intro: Spose]
Drink my coffee
Dankonia

[Verse: Spose]
Yo, I can hear the clock tickin'
Where is Flavor Flav? Give me all those 808s
I'll rhyme until it's Labor Day, yeah, you know how I rock
Put your shit on lay away, I found a way to make away
To wake up at the break of day to take it to the top
‘Cause I came from the bottom in a camper
Where the table turned into a bed, bed, bed
Born July 1st, I'm a Cancer
Crabby when I'm not getting head, head, head
That shit's stupid
Like coming home from work and the cat's been pukin'
Better get the Bounty
Me, I get a bountiful amount of pounds when I put I down for the townies
Go on the Internet, you can find the evidence
My oratory stories and my territory prevalent
Kinda like a "Yankees suck" bumper sticker on the whip
From, um, Presque Isle to Connecticut
So fuck the rest of it, the best is on the premises
So step up off the precipice, and quit the acting negative
I bust rhymes like a plus sign to a pessimist
So while your readers digestin' it
I figured I'd make it a fact, I'm kickin' and spittin' the track
I'm sippin' a little Aroma Joe's, no figurative [droop?] in the cash
You thinking we're making a rap, I'm rippin' a little of that
I lit it a minute ago, it's Spose, so bro, go [sendin'?] it back
I figured I'd make it apparent to people that never been fucking with me
That I'm addicted to flip it, just spitted a bit of the shit that I put in the B[?]
Never defeat, P. Dank, we've been waitin' to break it and make it our own
We gon' keep goin' till we can wake up in Dankonia, legally bake it our homes, Stiky!

[Chorus: Stiky-1]
All the ladies came, to Dankonia
[?] one of your homies up
I'm just here to tell ya, there's a better way
‘Cause P. Dank is happening, all day every day
Everyday
I wanna suck them titties, covered in milk girl
Cover them titties in milk girl
Cover them titties in milk girl
Cover them titties in milk girl
Gotta lap it up, lap it
You gotta lap it up, lap it up
You gotta lap it up, lap it up
Gotta lap it up, lap it
