[Hook: Shane Reis]
Man, we just gon' let it ride
And do whatever it takes to feel alive
That's in your body and spirit and in your mind
And take whatever you want, and that's fine
Except for mine, because what's mine is mine, it's mine

[Verse 1: Shane Reis]
I'm the one even if you're count's slow
I'm cold, cold like water when it's around snow
Maybe that's basic, but anyway you take it
It's wrote down, so you get read stripes like Jamaicans
First name Shane, but the Reis is after the David
My shit's a brand new game in the package, you gotta play it
But it's a souvenir, you could hear it's nothing to play with
I'm distinguished with the English, the favorite with the language
I hear 'em talking, but know that we're not acquainted
And know if I pay attention there's nothing for me to gain, man
The only to explain it
Is you're a fan and a wave at the fire, you can't contain it
While I, I got homies in the deep sea, divin'
And people that don't take less than a G for they time
And I got people who got the vibe of a tribe, it's all peace, bro
And the troop that'll show up in the booth [?] soaked

[Hook: Shane Reis]
Man, we just gon' let it ride
And do whatever it takes to feel alive
That's in your body and spirit and in your mind
And take whatever you want, and that's fine
Except for mine, because what's mine is mine, it's mine

[Verse 2: Jay Caron]
Ugh, I'm the man that other ones admire
Taking notes at my shows to study how to get live-r
They hoping that I retire, nope, I'm too wired
I'm dope, the claim different? That only means you're a liar
My fire still burns deep as the ocean floor
These weak swimmers getting ate up by open jaws
I break laws, break rules, paid tolls, paid dues
Seen me comin', start the runnin' 'cause, fucker, I'm bad news
I'm losing never, the talent beyond measure
With my squad on the job, we conquer any endeavor
Whatever it takes, high stakes just keeps my mind right
Connected with my fam, me and Reis? Yeah, we shine bright
No lime light, just raw life, simple as it seems
It ain't easy to succeed, we do it by any means
Which means to feel alive, we driving 'em extra miles
We ain't trying to just survive, we tryna do it with style

[Hook: Shane Reis]
Man, we just gon' let it ride
And do whatever it takes to feel alive
That's in your body and spirit and in your mind
And take whatever you want, and that's fine
Except for mine, because what's mine is mine, it's mine

[Verse 3: Spose]
Man, our team getting cream off the dream that you first abandoned
I smile while these losers grimace, caught 'em purple-handed
The same bros from the Maine coast that make 'em nervous, panic
Son, it's going down in the East like I reversed the planet
Presume you're not attuned to how the sale and merch is handled
Around here, only deer getting murked with hammers
My peers sneer when they think I'm near the perfect answer
Every page an empty room, or moon before a person landed
I'm never grown and I'm a student, watch me work the canvas
You lack a smart mind, it's dark times, go purchase candles
Getting money? Man, I got to like a cat in Spanish
Destined to prove it till there's movement in my circumstances
My mind polluted by a nuisance who is gruesome
Lettin' loose for his amusement, he been known to lurk and vanish
I can't beat him, so I learn to live with him like a shadow
Every day is like a battle where I try to curb his antics
Internal conversation, navigation of my crises
On the path to bigger math, bro, I watched the roads get icey
I could tell you're jealous by the way you wanna fight me
Got too many new kids and old debt to take this lightly
By any means, I justify the actions of my past
Who'll be huddled with me when I reach the top at last?
I hope my wife and kids and Shane and Jay, my mom and dad
I hope I handle it with class amid the blast of broken glass
Man, I'm sick... Nah, literally, I'm sick
I woke up with a head cold, but being ill never made me quit
Plus, Shane said Monday night he had to get this mix
So it's Monday, 3 PM, I chef the truth up pretty quick
We don't slouch, I might sell the couch
Man, I always maneuver, we only got one shot to get rich
You could break into my house, steal the mouse from my computer
But you still couldn't fuck with my clique, P Dank in this bitch

[Hook: Shane Reis]
Man, we just gon' let it ride
And do whatever it takes to feel alive
That's in your body and spirit and in your mind
And take whatever you want, and that's fine
Except for mine, because what's mine is mine, it's mine

[Verse 4: Mike Be]
Yo, I don't give a motherfuck about these rappin' types that reach for daps and ask advice
I'm on a path to stack a lot of cash and reach some massive heights
No need to clash and fight, I'm classic, that's a fact of life
You want the tracks with the crackle and static? Then ask for Mike
I'm magnifique, form a graphic when I stack the heat
And only answer back for stacks of cash when cats ask for beats
I'm a craftsman, I never had to cheat
And never asked for shit, 'cause all I need's within my grasp and reach
And enemies I had are changing up their strategies
To only ask for beats and autographs after my last release
Sad to see, I seen the snakes that creep below the grass
I know they love is fake, they reach for shanks when I show my back
Turning like a cul-de-sac, thought I wouldn't notice that
But I'll stay cooler than a cold snap out of the polar caps
[?] exactly as honest [?] find a team that's here
Mike, Jay and Shane'll be bothered by any means this year

[Outro: Shane Reis]
Man, we just gon' let it ride
