[Intro: ensemble]
No!

[Verse 1: Spose]
What's that? The beast up at the top of the map
He's back, the jungle stills, no Crosby or Nash
The crickets mute, birds fly up a branch
They call out to warn like the knees of your pants
So quick run, you chipmunks, go burrow with squirrels
It's him, the king predator, the end of the world
The fastest on Earth with legs all mechanical
The only animal who wears other animals
Scary in groups, but deadly alone
He created cities, planes, songs, movies, and poems
He made fire, now he's burning your home
No other creature made weapons just to murder his own

[Hook: Spose, KGFREEZE & ensemble]
Lions and tigers and bears
There's only one thing that's got 'em all scared; humans!
You better run for your life, humans!
You better run, humans!
You better run, humans!
Humans!

[Verse 2: Spose]
But some humans are good
Those ones are a blessin', they're protectin' the woods
I saw some little humans, they could save the world
If only there were no adults and only boys and girls
You know humans; God's mistake
They make him want a do over, quick, stop the brakes
The destroyer of worlds, he's a goblin, a mutant
I find it hard to believe that God is a human
While the animals watch on the hill
The bullets crack the sky, the humans get killed
A duck so cloaked in oil that's spilled
He cracked the planet, can't recoil the drill
Too smart for their own good, apocalypse mind
The end of evolution and the stop in the line
The best and worst species ever at the same time
They call 'em mankind, but man isn't kind

[Hook: Spose, KGFREEZE & ensemble]
Lions and tigers and bears
There's only one thing that's got 'em all scared; humans!
You better run for your life, humans!
You better run, humans!
You better run, humans!
Humans!

[Hook: Spose, KGFREEZE & ensemble]
Lions and tigers and bears
There's only one thing that's got 'em all scared, fuckin' humans!
You better run for your life, humans!
You better run, humans!
You better run, humans!
Humans!
You better run, humans!
You better run, humans!
You better run for your life, Humans!
You better run for your life, Humans!
You better run, humans!
You better run
