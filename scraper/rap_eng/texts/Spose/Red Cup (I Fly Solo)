[Intro: Lacey Schwimmer & Jean Paul Makhlouf]
Hey baby, why you being so shady lately?
What you talking 'bout girl?
What's going on? Huh?

[Verse 1: Jean Paul Makhlouf]
You know I told you girl
You're always on my mind
You know that I'm crazy about you
I need you right by my side
And I want you girl and I need you girl
You're the only girl in my life
Psych!

[Hook: Jean Paul Makhlouf]
I'm the gift that just keeps on givin'
I'm a slut and I won't stop (Ooooh)
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Shorty wanna roll, tell her bring her friends
Do it every night, party never ends
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Solo, solo, solo
I fly solo

[Interlude: Lacey Schwimmer]
Hey boys, mm
It's Lacey, baby

[Verse 2: Lacey Schwimmer]
You know I told you boy
You're always on my mind
You know that I'm crazy about ya
I need you right by my side
And I want you boy and I need you boy
You're the only boy in my life
Psych!

[Hook: Lacey Schwimmer & Jean Paul Makhlouf]
I'm the gift that just keeps on givin'
I'm a slut and I won't stop (Ooooh)
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Shorty wanna roll, tell her bring her friends
Do it every night, party never ends
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Solo, solo, solo
I fly solo

[Interlude: Spose]
Uh, yeah
Cash Cash in the house, baby
What's up? It's Spizzy Spose

[Verse 3: Spose]
It's cute you want a marriage, ring finger karats
So that you can call up Karen and tell her, "He went to Jared!"
But I'm Spizzy Spose, cougar, you are not enough
T-shirt, a polo logo, bro, go lift your solo cups
Girl, I'm a lone wolf and I'm a free bird
Lynard Skynard, I'm a sinner, taking women to dinner
Go tell your parents, I'm not awesome, I'm awful
I won't settle down like Jamestown, drive 'round, hat crooked, looking for the brothel

[Interlude: Jean Paul Makhlouf]
Yo, man, I'm tired of being single, dude
Maybe I should settle down a bit
Psych!

[Hook: Jean Paul Makhlouf & Lacey Schwimmer]
I'm the gift that just keeps on givin'
I'm a slut and I won't stop (Ooooh)
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
I'm the gift that just keeps on givin'
I'm a slut and I won't stop (Ooooh)
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Shorty wanna roll, tell her bring her friends
Do it every night, party never ends
Like a drink that I can't stop sippin'
Red cup, you know I fly solo
Solo, solo, solo
I fly solo

[Outro]
Yeah, uh
