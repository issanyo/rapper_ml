[Verse 1: Spose]
Let's talk about the shit that we don't talk about
We try to block it out, (Blocka blocka) block it out
The truth darker, cut sharper than a pencil tip
So grab a paddle, row to battle on the censor ship (What's that?)
That's the light of the comet that make the dinosaur vomit
That make the fossil, put the profit into Prophet Mohammed
The broken promises, the broken arms, broken hearts
How'd they put the shark up onto Noah's Ark? (Slaves?)
Man made fire in a cave, now the fire into flame, empire in a blaze (We need water)
Settle by the seaside, seas rise, ice caps, only room for babies in the life raft (Run!)
Bodies floating with the jellyfish (He might be alive), quick, poke him with the selfie stick
For that long we read the map wrong, history lies like a rap song

[Hook: Spose & Renee Coolbrith]
So everybody on the left side let me see your hands high
Party like there won't be a next time, if you're with me sing it now
There might not be tomorrow so you might as well be happy right now
And everybody on the right side let me see your hands to the drones
Fuck the prize, keep your eyes on your phone, everybody say
There might not be tomorrow so you might as well be happy right now

[Verse 2: Spose]
Right now, hard to focus on the present
When the gifts of the past still haven't unwrapped
(Repercussions) So get the J's on the feet
When there's rage in the street, man you better run fast
(Gun blasts) Sarah feared terror (Hide your face)
From mascara to the gas mask era
The glass mask wake the lab rats out the cat nap
It's about who brought the bottled water, not the cash stash (Look over here) When we eradicate the evidence
Pretend we only took off chains (Hey, don't look back there)
(Who's that?) Patriots vs. the Redskins
And I don't mean the football game and it's feeling like the fourth quarter
Clock ticking, world order
Blurred borders, Earth warmer (We need a space ship)
Tickets at a premium
We were never happy with the happy medium

[Hook: Spose & Renee Coolbrith]
So everybody on the left side let me see your hands high
Party like there won't be a next time, if you're with me sing it now
There might not be tomorrow so you might as well be happy right now
And everybody on the right side let me see your hands to the drones
Fuck the prize, keep your eyes on your phone, everybody say
There might not be tomorrow so you might as well be happy right now

[Verse 3: Spose]
You try to learn how to read, but the focus on the G's so you learn how to greed (I want it, gimme that)
Suck the oil out the Earth, put the pedal to the devil, no seeds, just speed (Full speed ahead)
Man I hope you saved the guap for the dollar war, on the same train of thought, all aboard (All aboard)
It's rich vs. poor (It'll trickle down), but never hit first floor
Add another weapon to the war chest (How they do that?)
More debt for the Corvette (Gotcha)
You just bought us ammunition (Woosh)
Another whistle-blower goes missing
Designer frames on those blind eyes (Looking good)
Keep working in that nine-five (Doing great)
Wings clip while the time flies (Time's up)
Bye bye

[Hook: Spose & Renee Coolbrith]
So everybody on the left side let me see your hands high
Party like there won't be a next time, if you're with me sing it now
There might not be tomorrow so you might as well be happy right now
And everybody on the right side let me see your hands to the drums
Fuck the prize, keep your eyes on your phone, everybody say
There might not be tomorrow sâ€“ *Gunshot*
