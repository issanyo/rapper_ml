[Verse 1: Spose]
I used to have work clothes, looking like I rolled in a dirt road
Boss was in jerk-mode now I got fans in the first row
Used to blaze two in a prelude
With my eyes all glassy like a space-suit
Spittin', gettin' pissy like a drug test
Sippin' on a blood red Bud Hev'
But I'm the best on the beats, it's destined to be
S to the P, O to the S to the E
Emceed, got cash for my speech
I never went to sleep without grass in my cleats
I been earning a permanent place and I'm taking it passionately
But my biceps are looking like Avril Lavigne's
I rep for Maine rap, I'm yet to change that
Sweat where my taint at, yep, the same cat
Jizzing on her vertebrae the way I came back
If he ain't wack, he must have "Spizzy" on the name tag
I been spittin' what the citizens livin'
And my vision isn't primitive, is it? It's like visitin'
When I deliver uninhibited rivetin' images
Of villagers' children, I got definitive scribblin'
Opponents groaning when I'm holding paper
I think they're unfamiliar with my nomenclature
All these hating thug rappers give me love after
And my raps attract biters like a bug zapper

[Hook: Spose & Chris Webby]
They told me in your dreams
Would I ever get to do this rap shit
Kept my head up and looked right past it
And I don't know about you
But I know I wanna do what I love
And I'ma do it till the day that I'm done
They told me in your dreams
Would I ever get to live this life
So I'm just making sure I'm living it right
And I don't know about you
But I'ma keep my trees rolled up
At the top, looking down like, "What!?"

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
You can find me posted up as a trace, and I stay in the cut
Fat dutch with my hand on my nuts
Wear a watch just ‘cause, I don't look at it much
Shit, I don't "slap a the bass," yo, I'm never in a rush - get it?
Just a stoner, no college diploma
But got a jar that's full of sour with a godly aroma
Got a load of bullshit I gotta deal with on the daily
Success is a motherfuckin' double edged blade, B
That's how it is, just a matter of fact
I'm a humble dude, yo, I just happen to rap
And I do it to the fullest, what's the matter with that?
Shit, I put the work in, let me gather my stacks
Shouts to Maine, OOB
From the 207 to the 203
Doing me, kicks clean when I step up in the scene
Fucking with me? In your dreams! Bitch, Webby!

[Hook: Spose & Chris Webby]
They told me in your dreams
Would I ever get to do this rap shit
Kept my head up and looked right past it
And I don't know about you
But I know I wanna do what I love
And I'ma do it till the day that I'm done
They told me in your dreams
Would I ever get to live this life
So I'm just making sure I'm living it right
And I don't know about you
But I'ma keep my trees rolled up
At the top, looking down like, "What!?"

[Verse 3: Spose]
I met some snakes in the apple like the first couple
Burned in that kerfuffle, learned the ropes and turnbuckles
So not to burst bubbles, but you must be wylin'
If you think I will be silent like the word "subtle"
I risked $100,000 on Spose, bros
If you're not "all in" on you, you oughta fold
Hunkered in my bunker tryna get it
Until I'm light-headed as spelunkers in a crevice
I got crowds yelling back like we're bickering
Because I spit the shit that's sicker than a chick who's sniffling
The formula's a simple thing, you get the tickets, sit, and then you sip a drink
I spit the hits that get you tickled pink around the nipple ring
Let me show you where Maine is
I'm from the pines, got lines like a flame-broiled angus
I slang language, been sellin' it from the genesis
Be ready ‘cause I'm heavy as Webby in the Connecticut
Scene, but by L.L. Bean, they said IN YOUR DREAMS

[Hook: Spose & Chris Webby]
Would I ever get to do this rap shit
Kept my head up and looked right past it
