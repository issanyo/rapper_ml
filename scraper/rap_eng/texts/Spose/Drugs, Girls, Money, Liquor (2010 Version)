[Verse 1:]
You can find me breaking up prescription drugs, on Egyptian rugs
I'm too blazed to be depicted thug, my blunts are like "what?"
Ziplocs used to be in tip top form, it's like my hip-hop
And then one morning police swarmed the dorm
I was warned, but didn't listen, ignored my inhibitions
I was snoring, they had warrants so now my parents bitchin'
"No tuition because of your drug addiction!"
"Oh Ryan, you're lyin'!" No, bitches, it's non-fiction
These blondes and brunettes are goddamn ruthless
My wallet's anorexic and starvin', it's quite retarded
Girls, you can't take them out like the garbage
When the dinner costs more than the rent for your apartment
They want diamonds, islands, expensive bottles
I'm like, "How about the dollar menu at McDonalds?"
But no girls are on their knees for fries and double cheese
So jeez, at least my right hand will fuck me for free!

[Hook:]
What's it all about?
Drugs, girls, money, liquor
Got me minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm alright
'Cause as long as I'm myself, it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
If you feel me say
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm alright
'Cause as long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
Shut the fuck up!

[Verse 2:]
Spizzy still unequivocally ill, but no deal
I'm from Wells, like the girl from The Ring, but no bling
No ice like summer and my bank balance a bummer
Call my mom's house, girl, they disconnected my number
I ain't stinkin' rich, but at least I don't stank
Fuck irrational skanks at Ocean National Bank
You know I'm broke, but still breaking up Garcia Vega
When I'm fiending White Castle or Sonic like Sega!
Muchos Cannabis, I'm a blunt analyst
Burritos, Fritos, Cheetos, and a sand-a-wich
I got the munchies and the dank's smellin' funky
And the chunky blunt's longer than a candle stick
Hey, I like herbal shit, Percocet, Vicodin
It's like Heineken after Heineken
I freestyle then rhyme again
Also I'm drunk, trying to find 'shrooms
And this slam pigs starting to look like Heidi Klum

[Hook:]
Aw yeah
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm alright
'Cause as long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
And if you feel me say
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm alright
'Cause as long as I'm myself, it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
(But shut the fuck up!)

[Verse 3:]
The time is now 4 A.M., bag with stems
No honeys, mo money
And this liquor got me feeling crummy, hug me
In a secluded room, probably smokin' Buddha
Probably thrice times booted, you can find me where the food is
Or [cough] studderin' and pukin' shit up
Like-like the second half of 2 Girls 1 Cup - yuck!
Lamented exes, and bimpin' sluts
Cause he's drunk like, "Whaaa, I don't give a fuuuu"
Wylin', drunk dialin', freestylin'
Zoned out, rocking closed eye-a-lids
Me? I will get higher when
I am smoking out a piece
Like I preach nonviolence
This liquor kicks it with my liver
But fuck that, where the drugs at?
Spizzy uninhibited drinker
Girl, you'll never find Ryan lyin' on the mic
But you might find Ryan high, lyin' on a dyke

[Hook:]
Aw yeah
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm alright
'Cause as long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
If you feel me say
Drugs, girls, money, liquor have got me
Minding my dimes and nickles
But still I'm alright
'Cause as long as I'm myself it's cool
I'm just trying not to be a tool
(Shut the fuck up)
