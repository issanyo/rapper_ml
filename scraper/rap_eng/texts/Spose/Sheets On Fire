[Verse 1: Spose]
In the city with the building looking burned down
Unjust, injust, there's nothing done 'bout
Shots fired, shots fired, having fun now
Better get your guns out, get your guns out
Dow Jones bailing out here on Wall Street
Mister Jones balling out here on Broad Street
Pray the sun wasn't dark from the cop heat
No loss, now she's praying up to God, "Please"
But God don't hear her 'cause he gave up
That or he don't exist and he's made up
'cause the kids still dying when they're prayed up
Like a hit record, man, 'cause they played us
While I adjust the snapback cap size
Boat full of refugees just capsized
Little boy in the ocean, getting baptized
And the waves were enveloped in his last cries
Taxes last year, man, I paid mine
So why's a little boy dying at like age nine?
But my bros looking good, hoes looking good
Spose looking good, don't know if I should speak out
Freak out on the beat one time
Open up my head, let me speak my mind
'cause they got a war in the streets outside
Made our bed, but the sheets on fire, man, they on fire

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
How can we sleep while our beds are burning?
How can we sleep while this Earth is turning?
How can we sleep while our beds are burning?

[Verse 2: Spose]
Take a father from a boy, who we got now?
Rap or stealin' since his dad getting locked down
He would beat the cycle, now he running from the cops sound
Sirens blare, pitch higher than a pot brown
Now his baby growing up without a dad too
Not his fault if he turns into a bad dude
Born into a game, play it how he has to
If you were a crab, you'd be crawling over crabs too
Something gotta give, something gotta give now
Adults failed and it's all up to the kids now
I don't want my little men up in the big house
Uncle Sam got a gun, better get down

[Outro: Spose]
Get down
Everybody better get down
Get down
Better get down
