[Intro]
Wells, Maine all over your face

[Verse]
What's up? I'm almost famous, I love that movie, shit
I guess I'm more infamous, video hits up on the Internet
Smile betwixt my dimples it's that
Chivalrous dick who spit it more than a little bit
I inflict my gifts on he who spits simpleness
I break 'em, make 'em slit their wrists
Hook 'em up with chicks I know with syphilitic slits, fucking idiots
Burning cylinders with villagers, that's on the syllabus
They wonder where my [?] will I tell them it is limitless
Infinite, when I speak to peeps, peak interest
Symphonies are jingly but intricate
They're conducting inquiries into how he's livin' it
If he's really in the cut or if he's only trimmin' it
Who is in his syndicate?
Why his clothes are mangy if he's angry, he ain't bigger yet
’Cause-’cause the way they figure it
I-I-I-I should be paid, late kickin' it
Well fu-fu-fuck guy, if you only had an inklin'
But-but-but pardon my French, but love my English
The label wants to know where the second single is
{*Crinkling noise*} I just crinkled it
Defensive at the end like Nickovich
Pour Macallan in the glass and take a sip of it, I'm sick of it
It's got me blue like the Apple Store, pacing back and forth
‘Cause I rap better and got clothes older than Macklemore
But this year, he's Giant Ryan's half a dwarf
Some sappy whore said, "Everything happens for
A reason," so I'm waiting for the explanation
Check out my skeletons I'm spellin' with my excavation
Or I'm just impatient
I need the justification
