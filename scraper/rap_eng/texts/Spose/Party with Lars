CHORUS:

It's a party with Lars, party with Lars! (x4)

VERSE 1:

SPOSE:
Man, last time I partied with Lars, he was on the roof
Mouth all bleeding with a broken tooth
He did a backflip with a broken leg
He turned around, spun around, looked at us said, he said
"My name is MC Lars, I'm gonna jump off the roof!"
We said, "Don't do it!", he said, "I'm gonna do it!"
We said, "Don't do it!", he said, "I'm gonna do it!"
Then he did it, then he landed on his feet
Then he broke into a dance move
Doing crazy types of shit that people can't do
He did the moonwalk, mixed it with the Macarena
All the girls aroused him, then they start masturbating
Then he grew wings, then he floated right over the pool"How is he doing that?", this dude is a fool!
This shit was so cool, he parties so hard
Nobody parties as hard when you party with Lars

CHORUS:
Man, this shit is insane
(It's a party with Lars, party with Lars!)
With Zelda on a chain
(It's a party with Lars, party with Lars!)
He was smoking cocaine
(It's a party with Lars, party with Lars!)
You'll be glad that you came
(It's a party with Lars, party with Lars!)

VERSE 2:

LARS:It's a party with Lars...
Wait, hold on Spose, what if my mom hears this?

SPOSE:
It's a party with Lars!
