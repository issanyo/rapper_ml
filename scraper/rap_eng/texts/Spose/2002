[Intro]
Spizzy!

[Hook]
I heard an MC this morning who made me wanna get in the booth
And no offense to him or his crew, but I know that I'm better than that dude
So what I gotta do to get his spot in hip-hop and my video on MTV2?
I know it can't be the skills, ‘cause mine have been ill since 2002, since 2000...

[Verse 1]
Too many Facebook rappers to unlike
This blank sheet of paper is the shit they done right
Whilst Peter been beating the beat up repeatedly
Leaving the body in Peabody, seemingly nobody noticed
I figured I'd take it and make it the focus
I'm the lord grand chancellor, Backwoods rambler
Rap career canceler, bumping Fiona Apple
I'm the weird beard grower, a ghost, a feared flow-er
A myth, a gift shower, I been sipping on a Snapple
In the cypher you can find me, I'm the wildest geek
My assignment has been rhyming, been aligned to the beat
My bud kind but I'm violent when I'm rhyming, delete
All pretenders who enter ‘cause my potential's elite
He's always stressing, excellent when blessing a show
My investments are destined to double, bubble and grow
So yes, in the flesh, the man, the mess, Spose
Who could still flow fresher than dressers of clean clothes
Oh, you getting to know the name I came to spell
I'm underground, yeah I came from Wells
So watch me play the bass line on a belt your favorite rapper just used so he could hang himself
"But it's all good, Spose!" No it ain't so swell
‘Cause I'm back down to Earth like some angels fell
‘Cause I popped up on the charts with some stained lapels
And then I disappeared faster than Dave Chappelle, poof

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Two! I been struggling rhyming like weed made of iron
That's how hard I've been grinding
Been neglecting assignments, dreaming of islands
But not recouping, beat looping with the droopiest eye lids
My ups and downs have both been critical
My free time is infinitesimal
Inside my ride, driving to the gig
Whipping it, kicking it, ducking the piglets, fine rhymes kid
There must be a connect, I can't find him yet
Don't want a private jet, just rhyming checks
Hey, you'll never find Ryan crying with the blues like sirens
Bro, this is no sob story
Even though they're hating in their verses
I don't want sympathy, this is a statement of purpose:
I will out work every motherfucker alive
And those who don't fuck their moms, too
Yo, yo, I got callouses that will amount to palaces
Analysis is cats is on my phallace, put 'em up
I sip McCallan, talented, vow to you no medallions
Challenge it till paralysis, dude, put 'em up
If you're playing Call of Duty, chilling watching television
And you wonder why you're going under, shut the fuck up
But, if you never relent, like you only loan things out once
Then guess what: your day gon' come

[Hook]
I heard an MC this morning who made me wanna get in the booth
And fuck him and his crew, ‘cause I know that I'm better than that dude
So what I gotta do to get his spot in hip-hop and my video up on Nah Right too?
I know it can't be the skills, ‘cause mine have been ill since 2002, since 2002

[Sample: Ryan Seacrest]
Some people are saying that this guy might be the next big rap star, and he's a white dude from Maine
His real name is Ryan Peters but he goes by, "Spose"
We need him to work some hip-hop into Bangor
