[Verse 1]
I'm waking up with the Whiz Wit' stains on the hoodie every Philly mornin'
Touring, my desire to aspire higher still enormous
The chronic got me gone on comets so I'm still in orbit
Stand tall in the squall never balled like Billy Corgan
I smash it in my demographic so I'm still important
(Who? 12 year olds?) I bring 'em in young, you silly Morman
Rappers Jekyll and Hyde, minus the Jekyll part
Steppin' in the session with the preferable repertoire
They wanna skirmish, leave em feeling squeamish
Turn it like a furnace leave 'em feeling like a fetus
Eric, I'm just being earnest: if you're scheming on an Edith
Fronting on my epidermis you should listen to the edict
Man, you're meager and weak, I want your femur to leak
I'm fuckin' evil with beats, call me Peter the Sheikh
I need peeps to delete, I'm eager to beast
It's the return! Luckily, I keep the receipt

[Interlude]
Right there in the fuckin' L.L. Bean Dune Grass Camos
Aroma Joe's stains on the kneecaps, fresh raps! Peter Sparker!

[Verse 2]
This is the sequel to the prequel of my feature, it's sweet
You're Facebookin', shook and lookin' for your beeper to beep
It's odd addition you've written, you think you're equal to me
You should speak your piece in brief and bring some reefer to me
Wiz Khalifa, Queen Latifah money: get it with my clever mouth
Keep pushing get the repercussions like devil's couch
I'm a nice dude, you should quit the talking back
Get dropped like ice cubes in the Johnnie Walker Black
Wells, Maine, reppin' it, babble never dabble in the decadence
Never spent a shekel on a necklace
Jargon in the margin of the parchment is a definite
Yard got horseflies, I've never seen a Pegasus
Tomato juice type on the flight, that's the preference
Had a blast in class regardless what the lesson is
"I'm Awesome," that song was lame, huh?
I'd make fun of your songs but nobody could name one, punk
