[Intro: Spose]
Mhm
They used to tell me give it up
Yo everybody give it up for PDank right now
Give it up
Used to tell me give it up

[Hook: Spose & J Spin]
Give it up
Hey, give it up
I know what I'm doing you should really give it up, oh oh, hey
Give it up
They used to tell me give it up
Now they all give it up so give it up
Hey, give it up
Give it up, you should really give it up, oh oh
They used to tell me give it up
Now they all give it up
PDank everybody give it up

[Verse 1: Spose]
Well the day I give it up, and I call it an ending
That's when hunters'll start giving up their second amendment
That's when Lil Uzi gonna take his nose ring out
That's the day I give it up and put this Spose thing down
Dude I'm, known to perform till my vocals are torn
When I, spoke it no more, the Pope'll do porn
They told me give it up, now they give it up for me
Give me a huge flying dog, this a never-ending story
Cameron

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
The day I'm stopping, I'll be laying in a coffin
Man I say it often, dropping off is not an option
I'm leaping off the deep end, not ceasing for any reason
And they wanna see me fall, like the leaves in autumn season
This shit is easy when believing in yourself, holmes
They wanna see me hang it up like a house phone
But no coat rack, still got them dope raps
You can peep my notepad if you think it won't last

[Hook: Spose & J Spin]
Give it up
Hey, give it up
I know what I'm doing you should really give it up, oh oh, hey
Give it up
They used to tell me give it up
Now they all give it up so give it up
Hey, give it up
Give it up, you should really give it up, oh oh
They used to tell me give it up
Now they all give it up
PDank everybody give it up

[Verse 3: Shane Reis]
Okay, now that we're underway, I can't go another way
It's andele, how could I not climb through now the tunnel's made?
I think I need a bump in pay, dot, dot, comma, blank
This shit can't be tucked away, they don't make a rubber maid
What I got planned next, you can't fit a cape over
I gotta be the Maine thing, something you can't state over
Not tryna sink or swim, I'm tryna be the lake's owner
And use your face to break all the drum breaks over

[Verse 4: Sarah Violette]
Yo they didn't like it, they didn't buy it, they didn't pay attention
I didn't fight it, I just write until my name was mentioned
On every list, your top five is now my favorite destin-
Nation, I'm patient, that plate was made to put my face in
808 nation, defacing every beat you making
Bass shakin', bitch you cooking up in Cam's kitchen
P. Dank, and you can't fuck with all this ambition
Four tires, one engine, but no transmission

[Hook: Spose & J Spin]
Give it up
Hey, give it up
I know what I'm doing you should really give it up, oh oh, hey
Give it up
They used to tell me give it up
Now they all give it up so give it up
Hey, give it up
Give it up, you should really give it up, oh oh
They used to tell me give it up
Now they all give it up
PDank everybody give it up

[Verse 5: Jay Caron]
Why the fuck would I ever give it up when the getting's just getting good?
I'ma get mine, y'all suckas can quit it
I'ma keep on shining, keep on living, writing scripts that's vivid
I'm the best, heads know it, they just won't admit it
So many long days and short nights, long drives and short flights
Long sets with short money, shit, it ain't funny
I've been on the path of success, for some time
Think I'ma give it up now? What is you, out of your mind?

[Verse 6: Mike Be]
Yo I'ma never quit being a dick, and also writing songs
Blowing bong hits in your face if you say my life is wrong
Strolling out at shows like I'm chosen, invite your mom
I say the most ridiculous shit if I know the mic is on
Uh, adjust your sight and see you suck at life
I never quit my duty, that's like Pookie giving up the pipe
You stuck with Mike, you geeks are learning I'm a seize your earnings
Plus I stay stacking the brackets just like Ashrita Furman

[Hook: Spose & J Spin]
Give it up
Hey, give it up
I know what I'm doing you should really give it up, oh oh, hey
Give it up
They used to tell me give it up
Now they all give it up so give it up
Hey, give it up
Give it up, you should really give it up, oh oh
They used to tell me give it up
Now they all give it up
PDank everybody give it up
