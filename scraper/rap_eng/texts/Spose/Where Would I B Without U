[Verse 1]
Aye
This one's for you
Thing four, thing three, thing one and two
The ones in the door when I go on tour
Yelling, "Papa please don't leave us no more"
Quick to tell a crew "all you need is you"
Did she hear what my dad said?
Who don't judge like Aaron when I come downstairs
And my hair looking like I'm a crackhead
If you think I'm great, pff, you just wait
My kid's gonna make me look like a mistake
They're my base like an 808
I like 'em more than Kanye, Kendrick and Jay
When the world gets dark, they're the light
When Ivy smiles, sunshine in the night
They have me beat, that's my mission in life
To get surpassed like an assist from a knight

[Pre-hook: Kristina Kentigian & KGFREEZE]
People giving props to me
They put on a record and get lost with me
They don't know quite what it costs to me
I don't wanna see

[Hook: KGFREEZE]
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?

[Verse 2: Spose]
Okay, let me say this officially
Though I usually don't say your name
'Cause people on the internet are insane
This one's for my Kristi
I would be on drugs, without you
Probably dead on a rug, without you
Probably let my ego grow so huge
That people hate me more than they already do
She was world peace when I met her
Though I do rap clever, I know that she deserves better
So I'm, Young Jeezy, R. Kella (What's that?)
Go get her for the cheddar
I know I'm stressed out, you deal with me
You never bullshit, always keep it real with me
I text the eggplant 'cause you know I can't help it
You're a G like a Green Bay helmet

[Pre-hook: Kristina Kentigian & KGFREEZE]
People giving props to me
They put on a record and get lost with me
They don't know quite what it costs to me
I don't wanna see

[Hook: KGFREEZE]
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?

[Verse 3: Sarah Violette]
Yo
Without you, I'm in a hopeless state
I'm out of focus, wait, yo let's expose the hate
You're the armor and the shield so I know I'd break
If you didn't hold the weight and wear the dopest cape
When you come to save the day and you close the case
Bring that justice, trust, it won't go away
You got the ultra rays and you warm me, you heat me
When the world leave me lonely and beat me
You still reach me, even when I'm shut down
Bill Belichick, you lead me to a touchdown
Hush now, when the world is too much now
You stay silence all the voices, you're the one sound
I want to hear when the apocalypse hits
'Cause you're awesome as tits, you're like Obama and shit
Without you, I'm marijuana unlit
You're who I wanna be with, you're who I wanna be with, okay

[Pre-hook: Kristina Kentigian & KGFREEZE]
People giving props to me
They put on a record and get lost with me
They don't know quite what it costs to me
I don't wanna see

[Hook: KGFREEZE]
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?
Where would I be without you?

[Ian Tour Interlude: Spose, Ian Stuart, KGFREEZE, God.Damn.Chan]
...making this song called "Humans" that I came up with
And then I got boned, and Max in here
And we're starting another â€“
Yo, Ian Stuart's gonna take over the livestream
Here he is, you can flip it around, do whatever...
Perfect
Hey, what's up guys, my name's Ian Stuart
I'm, uh, I'm the assistant today, and I'm gonna give you guys a nice little tour around the studio
Uh, so right now, we are in the little intro, not an intro, what is it called... foyer?
I don't know what it's called
Um, but you see guys outside, just kinda chilling
Um, there's a kitchen right here, a bathroom right here
Uh, there's a studio in this room, there's a studio in that room right there
That's a room full of amps
Uh, let's go upstairs and see what the guys are doing in Studio B, huh?
You guys have anything to say for Facebook Live? Spose's Facebook Live?
We've already got two hits
You've got two hits?
Two hits
Man, that's one more than downstairs...
Suck it, downstairs!!
Suck it downstairs, I don't know, you heard it here first
Let's go see what Channing's up to
I think I heard Channing's door's open over here, oh maybe not
I don't wanna bother Channing
Whoo, so out of breath
You know what's sad, is I lost like 40 pounds over the summer, and I'm still fat, that's not good right?
Alright, downstairs
Sup man, Channing, what do you have to say to Spose's fans on Instagram?
Um, we're making magic all day, for 24 hours, stay tuned
You already have like 8 beats done?
Uhhhhhh, I just figured out the room, so I got one beat, but I'm looking for a bass player right now
Channing's got one song done
