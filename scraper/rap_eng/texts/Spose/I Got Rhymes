[Intro: Spose & Cam Groves]
Cam Groves, Spizzy Spose
Wells, Maine, P Dank

[Hook: Cam Groves]
I got rhymes, rhymes, rhymes for days
You can't find a page with a line of space
I got rhymes
I got rhymes
I got rhymes, rhymes, rhymes galore
Up in the studio tryna find some more
I got rhymes
I got rhymes

[Verse 1: Cam Groves]
It's the M-I-C clinging, rhymes be stinging
Out of key singing, try sleep with three women
Who is he kidding? Charlie Sheen winning
Dude that truffle shuffle and hustle like Russell Simons
If you got a taste for the flavor that I'm bringing you
Then slow down the tape and just savor my writtens
Recorded by myself and I pay for the mixing
Turn that shit up till your neighbors are bitchin'
It's Slim Pickins coming with the Peter Sparker
Fucking up a beat till it's gonna need a doctor
Leave it bleeding, looking like a slob eating pasta
I take a lot shots and get weeded like a Rasta
Don't believe me? Better ask your ho
I pack a bowl, get backed like a casserole
So natural that I master flows
On the same microphone that I pass to Spose

[Hook: Spose]
You know I got rhymes, rhymes, rhymes indeed
You won't find nobody with more rhymes than me
I got rhymes, uh huh
I got rhymes
I got rhymes, rhymes, rhymes superb
Spit action words, even when they're not verbs
I got rhymes (Kablow)
I said I got rhymes

[Verse 2: Spose]
I got all plethoras and textures in my rhymes
I got some wack rhymes, I got some fine rhymes
I got some "Israel should leave Palestine" rhymes
I got some "Let me show a rapper how to rhyme" rhymes
"Fuck a nine to five" rhymes
I got some "Smoke some, drink some, pork a dime" rhymes
I got some "Don't drink and drive" rhymes
I got some "I don't give a fuck what you think of my rhymes" rhymes
If you, heard him, say, at a, turtle's, pace
I got them slow rhymes
But if I'm making the kids go take a vacation to Vegas and break out their [?]
Then you know I got them fast rhymes
Used to do it as a pass time
Got on my "Cash out the ass" grind
So if you haven't seen me in a minute
You don't gotta even ask why

[Hook: Spose & Cam Groves]
You know I got rhymes, rhymes, rhymes a bunch
I don't even stop writing rhymes at lunch
I got rhymes, and a pickle
Got rhymes, Cam
I got rhymes, rhymes, rhymes for weeks
Shit, I'll rhyme on beats until it's time to sleep
I got rhymes, yeah, yeah
I got rhymes, yo

[Verse 3: Cam Groves]
And now that I'm taking people's interests
On the next level shit, about to save the princess
See it clear, no smears, like Windex
Get it in with my kin, no incest
Got a big heart, in a thin chest
Y'all don't even know what style I'ma bring next
I just write down life now, in text
Everything I bring's on point like my index
Flow toxic, explosive, hot shit
Can't see me? You better grow some optics
Got no chain like a broken sprocket
Still your girl acting like she a broken faucet
Aw shit, man, I keep it conscious
Whether on some nonsense or songs with concepts
Just be honest, it's not that complex
I'ma keep making songs till I'm who's on next

[Hook: Cam Groves]
I got rhymes, rhymes, rhymes in stock
I can't even count all the rhymes I got
I got rhymes, yeah, yeah
I got rhymes, yeah
I got rhymes, rhymes, rhymes for years
So if you need some rhymes, come and find 'em here
I got rhymes, ha ha, yo
I got rhymes
