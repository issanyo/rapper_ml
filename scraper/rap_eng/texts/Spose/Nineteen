[Intro: Spose]
This one goes out to the office (What's up, Mike Be?)
Not, not the TV show, although I like the TV show (Peter!)

[Verse 1: Spose]
Like every other college kid, I was a drunk
A nineteen year old punk, waking up around lunch
Weed bags plump, and we called 'em trees
So you best believe that we turned 'em into stumps
Summer months I was living at my mom's
And I didn't pay rent but I did mow the lawn
Whenever she was gone, I would throw a party
Invited up every Carly and Tom that liked Bacardi and ganj'
We used to fit a hundred kids in the household
Beers in their mouth-holes till peers were out cold
We had dice in the living room, pong in the kitchen
Backwoods in my bedroom with thirty people in it
Singing, "Sky is the limit and you know that we keep on
Just keep on pressing on!"
Then my dog, Drew, walked in and broke the bong
(Fuck!) Rest in peace, Drew

[Chorus: Max Cantlin]
Purple smoke in the sky
Riding in the orange rain
See us getting high again
I was nineteen with my friends, yeah
Purple smoke in the sky
Riding in the orange rain
See us getting high again
I was nineteen with my friends, yeah

[Verse 2: Spose]
I was bimping with my townsfolk, broke and in Maine
Mayocraze up at Mayo's, it was that good (There was what?!)
And I don't recommend smoking cocaine
But we used to sprinkle yayo on the Backwoods
On the backroads, we'd do the beach cruise
Windows? Crack those, smoke wasn't see through
Up in Killa Beez Jeep, beep, beep, weed cheeched
By the beach, seated next to Katie Leech
Then went home and made a beat, me and Stiky rapped to it, F4!
Back when Zack B was living next door
That was '04 ('04), I was chilling with my cohorts
All sunburnt so my skin wasn't snow fort
I was eating mushrooms, laying in the driveway
Bumping Dark Side of the Moon
And if you were nineteen in Wells, Maine like I was
You would probably do that shit too

[Chorus: Max Cantlin]
Purple smoke in the sky
Riding in the orange rain
See us getting high again
I was nineteen with my friends, yeah
Purple smoke in the sky
Riding in the orange rain
See us getting high again
I was nineteen with my friends, yeah

[Verse 3: Spose]
Before Chris Brown punched chicks in the face
In my town, at a party at Yvette's place
I was nineteen, which means I was retarded
Drank tequila, hammered like Bob Vila in her apartment
I walked outside with Tom Knight, drunk
And we came up with this great idea (Okay)
She lived on Harbor Road, which was a huge hill
And there's two longboards right here (No way)
So we hopped on the longboards, went down the hill
Caught speed, both wiped out, and nearly got killed
I rolled through the road to the spot where the trees at
With blood all over me and rocks in my kneecaps
At least I didn't break my ankle like Tom
Had two chunks gone from my palms
Walked back to where the party was
And gave a girl a hug covered in blood

[Chorus: Max Cantlin]
Purple smoke in the sky
Riding in the orange rain
See us getting high again
I was nineteen with my friends, yeah
Purple smoke in the sky (This goes out to everybody in Wells, Maine)
Riding in the orange rain (2005 through 2009)
See us getting high again (Fucking stupid)
I was nineteen with my friends (But we're having a good time doing it), yeah (Sorry Mom)

[Outro: Spose]
Just for the record, uh
I injured myself on a longboard
In, you know in reference to that third verse
I injured myself on a longboard
But my man, Tom Knight, actually broke his ankle riding a Razor scooter
Sorry to call you out like that on the album, Tom
But - ha ha ha ha, busted
