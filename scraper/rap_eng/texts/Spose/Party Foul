[Intro]

[Hook]

I'm partied out, I partied all night
Now I'm waking up trying to make things right
Everybody's gone and I'm left here all alone
Got to clean the house before my mom comes home (comes home)
I'm partied out, I partied all night
Now I'm waking up trying to make things right
This is why you party at another guy's house
Damn it man, I knew I should have kicked y'all out
Party Foul!

[Verse 1]

My house is destroyed
Party foul!
Dude that's not a toy (seriously)
Party foul!
You tea-bagged your boy? (gross)
Party foul!
Now that you know the rules
You can get retarded now
That's half of the reputation
That put you on the map
You don't want to be that kid
Who puked on the cat (No)
These are people that
You are around a lot
Acting like children
You should take it down a notch
Times a million
No need to go ape so late
In the night I gotta work
At eight, alright? (aw man)
I saw you puking in the parking lot (blech!)
Plus you just spilled your shot
On my Ipod dock (whoops)
You're all cocky when
You're walking through
I'm about to write the book
On what not to do
Steve, put a shirt on
And Lindsey, you're a mom
And you shouldn't be converting
That lamp into a bong, c'mon

On aisle five...five yard penalty, repeat, beer pong)

I'm partied out, I partied all night
Now I'm waking up trying to make things right
Everybody's gone and I'm left here all alone
Got to clean the house before my mom comes home
I'm partied out, I partied all night
Now I'm waking up trying to make things right
This is why you party at another guy's house
Damn it man, I knew I should have kicked y'all out
Party Foul!

[Verse 2]

You took a leak in the jungle juice?
Party foul
You told her to be in love with you?
Party foul
You sharted in your underoos?
Party foul
Now that you know the rules
You can get retarded now
You want beer? (uhuh)
Well you should have brought more! (uhh)
And why are you wearing sunglasses indoors?
You've been drunk from the outset
Your hair looks like you stuck your finger in the outlet
You just killed my house pet
Dude, you're on some other shit
Walking around my home with a boner
Trying to ask me where my mother is (that's fucked up)
And that's fantastic, mmmhm
Dude don't smoke that
Those are grandma's ashes! (holy shit!)
I'm losing my patience
The party was raging
Until you changed the station
And you put that Ace of Base in (what the fuck?)
And I wouldn't be so abrasive
But you pissed in my basement
And blamed it on Jason

(*static* Douche-bag-manlike conduct on the couch, not only is that chick 14
AND asleep, but...I...I mean...I mean it's a spray tan dude, c'mon)
