No relieving, this feeling
'Cause these kids talk like I'm not Hip-Hop
No relieving, this feeling
You think my shit's soft? Now I'm feeling pissed off
No relieving, this feeling
'Cause nowadays, I been feeling like a different man
No relieving, this feeling
Ooh, I get the feeling that this shit's about to hit the fan

[Verse 1: Cam Groves]
I started rapping and I knew I had that knack for it
Way before you could buy music at an app store
Know a lot of rappers wanna throw me out the back door
If you're on the bottom, homie, you should fucking rap more
And I don't care, I'm aware that I'm bitter
The most terrifying spitter that ain't verified on Twitter
And I ain't gon' stop, I don't dare to be a quitter
Sicker than drinking liquor and then staring at the shitter
I never sold work, I never bust slugs
I never done dirt, I've never fucked mud
I've done some dumb stuff, couple times, cuffed up
But you don't see me grab the mic, acting like I'm tough stuff
Snap, crackle, pop, lock and drop it
I've been Hip-Hop since hopscotch and Walkmans
It's Vietnam with these bombs that I'm droppin'
I'm trying to pop off like a crock pot in Boston

[Verse 2: Shane Reis]
Is it my turn to be flexin'?
I come through without a buzz like a bee nest
[?] relentless
I don't smoke, but been dope since back when they thought that my cologne was weed scented
The funny thing is now that my feet have found the ground
It's daps and fist pounds whenever we step in
But I've never unseen the scene, in the scene
Since I was green reppin', take heed to those who seem brethren
They try to keep down the decent names to be ahead
But me pretend? Shit, I would rather leave headless
But I swim in the deep end dependin' on what it's dependent on
What side of the fence is wrong?
Is it my decision? Man, I get it where I fiddlin'
Speak my mind, but keep in mind that we are different, man
All [?] benefited, man
I've done nothing less than go and get it
So at least when shit hits the fan, my hands is thick and spent

[Verse 3: Cam Groves]
I'm here to describe that feeling inside
You try to conceal it, but really, it's just building in time
That's why, I keep it real till people feeling my vibe
Until I got 'em throwing hand towards the ceiling and sky, I
Don't wanna sound like I'm harder than the rest, but
When the bass is pumping like the heart up in my chest, then
Once you feel it starting, then it's harder to suppress, so
I attack the beat like a cardiac arrest, ugh
Cam is making damn beats until my hands are shaking
You haters thinking that I'm faker than some animation
You got some damage waitin', I got a plan to make it
Your weak crew see-through like they laminated
I know you hate it, I'm stating the hard facts
My bars bombard tracks like cars on tarmac
It's P. Dank, yeah, we headed to the top
Got a feeling that we'll make it if this feeling doesn't stop
