[Intro]
Dude, dude, do that "Mirror Mirror" shit

[Verse 1: Spose & J Spin]
Bank balance been carnage, couch cushion incarnate (damn damn)
Damaged goods, I'm tarnished, bulbous, beard bushy, James Harden
I got dirty, mm, garments, ooh, beer, yeah, carcass (ayy)
These are minor swells, I'll get that title belt
I might as well, I've been feelin' Mike as hell
Michael Scott, Michael Jordan, Michael Phelps and Michael B. Jordan
Shit, my self perception perfection my visage an image impressive
The kid is a vision of exodus
Shit is a prism reflection
Man, I woke feelin' like nah bro, you don't know me
Homie from the nosebleeds
I should be an emoji, I woke up feelin' like Kobe
If I was you, I would clone me, if I was you, I would bone me
'til the day I die, when I look me in the eye and we say

[Chorus: Spose & J Spin]
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the greatest of 'em all?
Me, no me, me, me, no me
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the greatest of 'em all?
Me, no me, me, me, no me

[Verse 2: J Spin]
Hands full, I still handle biz, got a can full of that cannabis
Sight of money, I can't resist, and my grandkids gon' be hella rich
Like mirror mirror on the wall, how the hell did we get this far?
Still ride around in them broken cars, I'm nice though, I really go this hard
Look in the mirror, I used to be bitter, almost a quitter but thank God I didn't
Now I just curl up again and again, I was a villain but now I'm a friend
Remember the feelin' we never would win, reached for the ceilin' once hope hit the fan
Dude of the city, I got it on cam, whoa, this ain't as hard as I can go
And they said that I'd never be shit, no, oh whoa
This why [?] and I'm talkin' like this, now one, two, three, four

[Chorus: Spose & J Spin]
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the greatest of 'em all?
Me, no me, me, me, no me
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the greatest of 'em all?
Me, no me, me, me, no me
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the greatest of 'em all?
Me, no me, me, me, no me
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the greatest of 'em all?
Me, no me, me, me, no me

[Verse 3: Spose]
I look in the mirror, damn, it's just so scenic
Katie Lavike in fifth grade, she told me I'm conceited
I said, "what's that mean, bitch?" She said, "don't call me a bitch!
Conceited is arrogant, it means you're a dick!" I said, "it sounds like it means I'm the shit"
Man, I'll be dope 'til I'm seventy, I am a God, I'm so heavenly
I'm 5'8 but feel seven feet 'cause my ego goes on and on
Higher and higher and high, one day I'll pop and I'll fall from the sky
Cue the parade I demand when I die, on the highway to hell, can you give me a ride?
Mirror mirror, hit me back, want no fiction, only facts
If I'm the greatest ever, play that sax

[Chorus: J Spin]
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the greatest of 'em all?
Me, no me, no me, no me
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the greatest of 'em all?
Me, no me
