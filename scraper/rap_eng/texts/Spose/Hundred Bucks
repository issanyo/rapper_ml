[Chorus: Abby Susain]
I'm not fucking on a plane, but I'm coming up
Silhouetted, coming, coming out the underbrush
Found a Franklin underneath my seat crumpled up
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks
Hundred bucks, hundred bucks
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks
Hundred bucks, hundred bucks
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks

[Verse 1: Spose]
I'm back in the building, I feel like a billion
Been repping my village, professionalism
I'm up on the ceiling, I had me some children
My music buy diapers, I feel it, you feel it
My glass half full, plus I pour some Scotch up in it
Feeling like the man of the hour, ‘cause I spent lots of minutes
But I don't need much, Celtics game, hundred bucks
Cup of coffee in my clutch, plus my family, that's my crutch
I been flipping since my Genesis that's Ecco the Dolphin
Plus I keep coming like, checks from "I'm Awesome"
I feel like I made it by saying my cadence
I'm making arrangements to spit entertainment
Not just to get famous or pay for my payments
Though omelet-plated at Denny's my fragrance
I'm not fucking on a plane, but I'm coming up
Silhouetted, see me coming out the underbrush

[Chorus: Abby Susain]
I'm not fucking on a plane, but I'm coming up
Silhouetted, coming out the underbrush
Found a Franklin underneath my seat crumpled up
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks
Hundred bucks, hundred bucks
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks
Hundred bucks, hundred bucks
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
I ain't got much, but I spot lunch
Or a ripped bruschetta ‘cause it got crunch
Got soups for days, plus the bullion eggs
Got Creme Anglaise with the hot fudge
That's not much, yeah I make it every week off rhymin'
Hundred dollars on the bill, and I'm winin', dinin'
Got a million dishes when I'm dining with my misses
You can find me in the kitchen with a Heini getting lifted
Yo, y'all know I like to cook
When it come to date nights, I write the book
Fish right from hooks, with a knife I'm good
I slice and dice, on the mic I would
Yo, and I just ordered the cioppino
Casino, I want a c-note, now I'm feeling like De Niro
I'm not fucking on a plane, but I'm coming up
First class, free meal, right in front of us

[Chorus: Abby Susain]
I'm not fucking on a plane, but I'm coming up
Silhouetted, coming out the underbrush
Found a Franklin underneath my seat crumpled up
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks
Hundred bucks, hundred bucks
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks
Hundred bucks, hundred bucks
Feeling like a billion with a hundred bucks

[Bridge: Spose]
90 bucks, 80 bucks (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
70 bucks (oh oh oh oh oh)
60 bucks (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
40 bucks (oh oh oh oh oh)
10 bucks (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Don't let money determine if you're happy or not
Lots of rich people are miserable

[Outro Conversation: Spose & Cam Groves]
Just got to Anaheim tonight, we saw the fuckin, uh, turn off on 5 South, south of San Francisco, where we popped the tire and pulled over last... last tour, we drove by it today. Luckily, no tires popped today, but I'm sure we'll have some other unforeseen incident soon. But um, no popped tires
Well that's good, man. It doesn't quite weigh into losing all your shit, but, no popped tires is always good, that was a pain in the ass. But, well that's sweet, I hope the rest of it goes smooth, uh, smooth as fuck, no issues. Uh, I'm sure to keep in touch, see how it goes. I wanna try to make it to the New York show. Supposed to be a big surprise. It'll be a big surprise if I do make it, but yeah I'll still be surprised it I do make it
