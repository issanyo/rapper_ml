[Intro]
Yeah, Spose

[Verse 1]
Every time Spose and a beat coalesce
It is no less than sick, nasty, grotesque
Disgusting rhyme-busting twenty-something
Dude who gets booty like a pirate chest
So gobble a dank if you don't like him
‘Cause lyrically he rape a beat like a viking
Flow so honed, hot as your blood
Cool as snow cones, what is all good?
Quite suburban, he's not at all hood
Not country, just the woods so fuck Keith Urban
I've rapped tight and over your head
Like a turban since you nerds left turds in the bed
I'm absurd with words emerged in burned threads

[Interlude]
We need more beats

[Verse 1]
Every time Spose and a beat coalesce
It is no less than sick, nasty, grotesque
Disgusting rhyme-busting twenty-something
Dude who gets booty like a pirate chest
So gobble a dank if you don't like him
‘Cause lyrically he rape a beat like a viking
His flow's so honed, hot as your blood
Cool as snow cones, what is all good?
Quite suburban, he's not at all hood
Not country, just the woods so fuck Keith Urban
I've rapped tight and over your head
Like a turban since you nerds left turds in the bed
Absurd with words emerged in burned threads
Like a phoenix from the art of emceeing left dead
My friends jock dreads and play death metal
In Maine where they mount fox heads from the meadow
On the wall, I'm off the wall, Michael Jackson
Maxing at Federal Jacks with something attractive
I'm a cactus with this rap shit (Spose)
Never resort to wack tactics (No)
Jaw-dropped reactions when I'm rappin' (So)
Fly it's making me high like Toni Braxton
Mr. Spizzy is now teaching classes
So throw away all your busy-work packets
Decidedly un-ghetto rhyme fello
Who listens to Sublime from time-to-time, hello it is
Spizzle, they're miserable I exist
They're pissed but this rhyming mindless drivel can't persist
My flow's A-list, your flow is gayness
I think you get the gist so listen up kids
I'll be at 15 Chester, weed on the dresser
I'm clever but slept on like Lunesta
Peace

[Bridge]
Who in the fuck is this dashing boy?
Who raps religiously like Pastor Troy?
Spizzy Spose is fly like asteroids
Lyrically he's passed your boys
But where's he from? Wells, Maine

[Verse 2]
Got a lot of dollars in my wallet, nah, I'm broke
Not a baller, marijuana is the product I promote
I hope people see I'm ghoulish in the face
So they understand when I'm caught staring into space
Fly like McLaren, high like a parrot
Coughing so hard, looking like I'm in hysterics
Known amongst Jareds and Dereks as the rarest
Rapper staring at your weed, asking you to share it
Like Napster, Mainers jock tractors
Hold up... Rest in peace, Ol' Dirty Bastard
Ol' Dirty Curtis came back from the grave
Pussies got AIDs, walking like zombies
Broken Motorolla, roll of quarters for the laundry
Smoked up, sitting there, looking like Ghandi
Stiky-1, leather jacket, looking like Fonzi
Deep in thought, creeping like the cops
Heineken bottle pops and no models give me props
Rarely touch supple couple cupped tittied city sluts
Keep it York County, what up townies?
Lifted all the time like Canadian mounties

[Outro]
G-g-g-gobble a dank
Baby, gobble a dank, baby
Spizzy Spose if you need him and if you don't
(Preposterously Dank)
Wells, Maine
0-4-0-9-0
In pussies like gyno
Old school like dino with the rhyme flow
It's all good, what it does?
Sorry to beat ya rappers
Meet me at the Wells House of Pizza after
Preposterously Dank the album
We Smoked It All mixtapes, volumes 1 thru 649 coming soon
(Spizzy Spose)
Keep it bimpin'
