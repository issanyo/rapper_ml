[Chorus]
I wanna be a hipster, get a couple pairs of pants from my sister
Get wax for my mustache whiskers
Keep it growing till I'm looking like a drifter
Whoooa, I guess I'll be a hipster
Let everybody know that I'm lookin'
For some cigarettes and some couch cushions
For the day that I move out to Brooklyn
And start a band

[Verse 1]
And the name of the band will be some symbols
And our music will never sound simple
And when people start to like us
We'll break up ‘cause people liking is lame
And we're weird
Weird, weirder than you

[Verse 2]
I don't sip an I.P.A
I sip that double I.P.A
Vanilla Stout
Brewed with nutmeg and barley from
Some country besides Bavaria
‘Cause Bavaria's too trendy and I don't like anything that's trendy
Even though I'm just a fucking poser

[Chorus]
I'll be a hipster, get a couple pairs of pants from my sister
Get wax for my mustache whiskers
Keep it growing till I'm looking like a drifter
Whoooa, I guess I'll be a hipster
Let all my friends out there know that I'm lookin'
For cigarettes and some couch cushions
For the day that I move out to Brookyln
And start a band
