[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
You said you're gonna get up off the couch (you won't)
You said you're gonna put an album out (you won't)
You said you're gonna go out on a limb (you won't)
You said you're gonna take it to the gym (you won't)
You said you're gonna get out of your way (you won't)
You said you're gonna make it one day (you won't)
You said you're gonna put me in my place (you won't)
Tell me will you say it to my face? (you won't)

[Verse 1: Spose]
She said "Spose, all these rappers lie to us," (you won't)
That's why it's sold out in Massachusetts (you won't)
Play my favorite record on stage (you won't)
I play the record then they all rage (you won't)
Get it (get it) popping like it's Mary, that's my momma, got a scary 'mount of dollars in my pocket to be honest
Prolly oughtta go deposit 'fore I end up in a robbery, abilities, humility, I feel like an anomaly
Sell more records than Spose (you won't)
Have fans other than your bros (you won't)
Have a bank account with five 0's (you won't)
And still, rock the same damn clothes (you won't)
Make a track, take a bath (you won't)
I whipped up another album, it was crack (you won't)
I can't stop, I won't stop (you won't)
I'm in the studio the day my album drop cause I'm tryna get the trophy, homie, lonely back when people didn't know me
But I said I'm gonna make it but they told me (you won't)
So I had to prove it, kept it moving, my maneuver
Spitting human flaws, always kept it raw (you won't)
Find a rap dude like me (you won't)
Who only spit the truth like me (you won't)
Who kill it in the booth like me (you won't)
And make the weed go poof like me

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
You said you're gonna get up off the couch (you won't)
You said you're gonna put an album out (you won't)
You said you're gonna go out on a limb (you won't)
You said you're gonna take it to the gym (you won't)
You said you're gonna get out of your way (you won't)
You said you're gonna make it one day (you won't)
You said you're gonna put me in my place (you won't)
Tell me will you say it to my face? (you won't)

[Verse 2: Cam Groves]
You don't wake up in the morning wishing it was pouring just so you don't gotta go to work, even though you can't afford it
You be working on an album and you trying to record it, on top of all that, couple weeks you're going touring?
For little pay, straight claim for thrills
Most people my age steady paying the bills
I been working on the double tryna climb the ropes
Why you gave up on your dreams a long time ago?
Work five days in a row (you won't)
After work hit the studio (you won't)
Friday gotta do a show (you won't)
Saturday shoot a video (you won't)
I do what it takes till I'm blue in the face
Cause I don't ever wanna see none of you in the race
I passed a lot of local rappers, left a few in their place
I look back if you stop perusing the chase
And you could be the most talented person alive, but
That don't mean shit if you don't have drive
If you don't believe then you won't get by
If I don't succeed, well at least I tried
I told you to get up off my dick (you won't)
Say my name when you write a diss (you won't)
You once were respected and you made a few records but can you do it quite like this? (you won't)

[Chorus: Dave Gutter]
You said you're gonna get up off the couch (you won't)
You said you're gonna put an album out (you won't)
You said you're gonna go out on a limb (you won't)
You said you're gonna take it to the gym (you won't)
You said you're gonna get out of your way (you won't)
You said you're gonna make it one day (you won't)
You said you're gonna put me in my place (you won't)
Tell me will you say it to my face? (you won't)
