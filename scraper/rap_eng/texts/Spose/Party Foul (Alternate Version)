[Chorus: Rome]
Young man, you're a party foul
I gotta kick you out my house
Young man, she's a party foul
And now I gotta kick both 'em out
Like (hey) You're a party foul
(Oh) You're a party foul
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
And I ain't saying that you gotta go home
But you gotta get out, you ain't welcome in my house

[Verse 1: Spose]
My house is destroyed
Party foul!
Dude, that's not a toy (seriously)
Party foul!
You tea-bagged your boy? (gross)
Party foul!
Now that you know the rules, you can get retarded now
That's half of the reputation that put you on the map
You don't want to be that kid who puked on the cat (nope)
These are people that you are around a lot
Acting like children, you should take it down a notch times a million
No need to go ape so late in the night
I gotta work at eight, alright? (aw man)
I saw you puking in the parking lot (blech!)
Plus you just spilled your shot on my iPod dock (whoops)
You're all cocky when you're walking through
I'm about to write the book on what not to do
Steve, put a shirt on, and Lindsey, you're a mom
And you shouldn't be converting that lamp into a bong, c'mon

(*static* Illegal fake announcement of the cop's arrival
On aisle five...five yard penalty, repeat, beer pong)

[Chorus: Rome]
Young man, you're a party foul
I gotta kick you out my house
Young man, she's a party foul
And now I gotta kick both 'em out
Like (hey) You're a party foul
(Oh) You're a party foul
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
And I ain't saying that you gotta go home
But you gotta get out, you ain't welcome in my house

[Verse 2: Spose]
You took a leak in the jungle juice?
Party foul!
You told her to be in love with you?
Party foul!
You sharted in your underoos?
Party foul!
Now that you know the rules you can get retarded now
You want beer? (huh...)
Well you should have brought more! (uhh)
And why are you wearing sunglasses indoors?
You've been drunk from the outset
Your hair looks like you stuck your finger in an outlet
You just killed my house pet
Dude, you're on some other shit
Walking around my home with a boner
Trying to ask me where my mother is (that's fucked up)
And that's fantastic, mmmhm
Dude don't smoke that
Those are grandma's ashes! (holy shit!)
I'm losing my patience, the party was raging
Until you changed the station
And you put that Ace of Base in (what the fuck?)
And I wouldn't be so abrasive
But you pissed in my basement and blamed it on Jason

[Chorus: Rome]
Young man, you're a party foul
I gotta kick you out my house
Young man, she's a party foul
And now I gotta kick both 'em out
Like (hey) You're a party foul
(Oh) You're a party foul
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
And I ain't saying that you gotta go home
But you gotta get out, you ain't welcome in my house
