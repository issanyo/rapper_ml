[Chorus: Lyle Divinsky]
I been losing patience
For so long I been waiting
I need some shit to pop off by like Tuesday night
And by 9 on Wednesday morning
If I'm not huge, enormous
Then roll one up and meet me at the drawing board

[Verse 1: Spose]
Man fuck rap, I'll make a hundred million without it
Just to shove it down the throat of everybody who doubted
I'm tired, people sleeping on me
I've grown cold, I'm fire
When they'll recognize that, I don't know
First Logic, Macklemore, and now Russ popped off
I count my paper up in Maine like, nah, I must not rock
Blogs scissoring their pictures, Mom I must not stop
Need a spot in my museum with my bust on top
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Wells, Maine, me and Cam, we dippin' again
Kept my beard to the beach, I'll help out J Spin
I'm back like Roseanne but I'm not getting cancelled
Gold plaque hanging at my spot up in Sanford
When's the platinum one coming? Someone give me the answer
Saturday, Sunday and Monday too, I'm in the stu
Tryna make the fucking dream come true
But lately

[Chorus: Lyle Divinsky]
I been losing patience
For so long I been waiting
I need some shit to pop off by like Tuesday night
And by 9 on Wednesday morning
If I'm not huge, enormous
Then roll one up and meet me at the drawing board

[Verse 2: Spose]
Every morning someone says I saved their life in a DM
And every night, I'm stressing like I didn't receive them
Go tell the Cartman department I'd like to file a grievance
But my merch line's so long you thought it was leaving
And it's still there a hour later
I been grinding since the Power Rangers, and I'm still unknown?
It's hard to swallow like an hour later
Nah, it's a croc like alligator
That I've not yet blown
Bro I invented humble rap, I watched them all copy
Do the children's book, the app, watch them all copy
I think it tastes gross, but you know me, all moxie
So either way you're gonna need some oxy's to stop me
Cause I'm not dumb
I never pretended to rep where I'm not from
Tell me what exactly I could do that I've not done
I'll pull the business debit out, bro I got lunch
Tell me what I gotta do cause

[Chorus: Lyle Divinsky]
I been losing patience
For so long I been waiting
I need some shit to pop off by like Tuesday night
And by 9 on Wednesday morning
If I'm not huge, enormous
Then roll one up and meet me at the drawing board
