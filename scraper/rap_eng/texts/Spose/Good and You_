[Intro]
Ayup
How you doing Bob?
Good and you?

[Verse 1]
I don't know where my next dollar is coming from
But I keep recording every day, I put it out and I don't know if it'll pay
I don't know if you will like it, I don't know if it'll sell
I don't know if people waiting for a rapper from Wells
But I'm tryna make it how it ought to be, I'm rhyming on a lotta beats
Every night I'm grinding like my daughter's teeth
I don't know if this video that I just spent five grand on will work out
Or I'll have to move in with my grandma
It's not like I don't got no kids, I got two
Bout to have four, if you don't buy this shit we'll be poor (so buy my shit)
Believe in myself, hence the riskiness
You scared mother fuckers, I'm like the antithesis
But there's no map to the way I do my business
I'm on my odyssey, I'm feeling like Odysseus
And I don't know the end to my tale
I just know I'm not afraid to fail
Sorry but I gotta ask

[Hook]
Hey how you feeling? Good and you?
I can't complain, I'm feeling pretty good, and wouldn't you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
So now I'm feeling pretty good, pretty good and you?
(Ayup) Good and you?
(Good and you?) Good and you?
(Good and you?) I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
(Ayup) Good and you?
(Good and you?) Good and you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do

[Verse 2]
Man, I could put you up on what it takes to get down
I imaginated a place, then I made it, I'm proud
You had better get acquainted with the flavor of ground
Bet a brazen amount, what's a savings account?
Do you got time to wait? No I'm making it now
I'd rather fill a lake with razors and then wade in and drown
It's feeling like a circus how my life won't stop
Tickets purchased, juggling, performing, tightrope walk
The taste of success is always a bit sour
No time to sniff roses or to think you shit flowers
Get accustomed to long nights and quick showers
And risk more than that game that takes six hours
If you, if you, if you, if you like sleeping at night
Then you probably couldn't even eat a piece of the life
So break weed and take heed of my beleaguered advice
Cause I'm the pilot and the passenger, the beacon of light
I'm just asking

[Hook]
Hey how you feeling? Good and you?
I can't complain, I'm feeling pretty good, and wouldn't you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
So now I'm feeling pretty good, pretty good and you?
Good and you?
Good and you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
Good and you?
Good and you?

[Bridge]
You are not quite like me
Risking every dollar, betting all of my cheese
Spray my bank account because I believe
Since I was twenty with a fake ID
I'm doing good and you are not quite like me
Couldn't go the places that I might go
Couldn't count the money from a sold out show
If I didn't take a leap into the unknown
I'm doing good and you are not quite like Spose

[Hook]
Hey how you feeling? Good and you?
I can't complain, I'm feeling pretty good, and wouldn't you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
So now I'm feeling pretty good, pretty good and you?
(Come on) Good and you?
(How you feel?) Good and you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
(Uh huh) Good and you?
Good and you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
(Ayup) Good and you?
Good and you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
Good and you? (You wouldn't do it)
Good and you?
I took a risk, did what a lot of people wouldn't do
