[Intro: Cam Groves]
Everybody throw your hands up right now
And make some goddamn noise
Hailing from the state of oceans and lakes
Get ready for those good rhymes and metaphors
The state of Maine changing the game
Make music good for your brains
So open your ear lobes, this here's Spose

[Verse 1]
With no rims on the whip and no collagen lips
I rip through the state of Maine with the halogens lit
I'm not Rick but I spit Slick
I'm rapping and making the fakest of rappers who're thinking they're sinking my ship quit quick
All aboard!
From the state where they think we all mate with our cousins
With no indoor plumbing, Moose by the baker's dozen
We got lakes, ponds, deer on lawns
Puff upon chron', rockin' long johns
Spat verses over-purchased thirty racks of beer
Made peers laugh and cheer
Throw a hand up in the atmosphere
‘Cause everybody knows my name like the cast of Cheers
But they say I shouldn't rap from here
I made it finally
Puffed all kinda leaves
Wack rapper, time to leave
Rhyme's sick, Lyme disease
Pine trees, skate rails
While mostly white trophy wives rock fake nails at bake sales
And all the haters say, Spose

[Hook]
Are you out of your brain!?
Rapping from Maine!?
You must be insane!
‘Cause you can't get there from here
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
You can't get there from here
You must've lost your mind!
I mean, those rhymes
They were fine for the time
But you can't get there from here
You're from the eastern-most, northern-most, boredom-soaked state
You can't be great
You can't get there from here

[Verse 2]
I'm from where teenage moms and their babies dwell
Where people downgrade from cocaine to oxy pills
Where the wives get beat and no one hears them yell
And it's not Compton or Brooklyn or ATL
We spend most times weeded
‘Cause the coastline's scenic
But the chances of succeeding are slimmer than a bulimic
Still I put my life in rhyme form and recorded it
On my debut and stayed true to my coordinates
No, never aborted it
Ask my subordinates
Since back when my weed had more seeds than tournaments
I'm going for the gold (as if that wasn't obvious)
And stopping Spose? That's like tryna handcuff an octopus
Woke up every morning wrote a new verse
Even if I wasn't winning I wasn't a loser
Look, if you want to excel like huge shirts
Doesn't matter what your zip-code is, just do work

[Hook]
Are you out of your brain!?
Rapping from Maine!?
You must be insane!
‘Cause you can't get there from here
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
You can't get there from here
You must've lost your mind!
I mean, those rhymes
They were fine for the time
But you can't get there from here
You're from the eastern-most, northern-most, boredom-soaked state
You can't be great
You can't get there from here

[Verse 3]
They say you can't get there from here without magic
Well POOF! I Google Mapsed it, I'm there, maxin'
I-I I seen 'em laughing now I'm the main attraction
And when I die, they'll pour out all their Pabst in my absence
Steered off course, fuck your path, I'm the captain
Crunch time all day, serial with my actions
No need for lucky charms, just a bit of passion
To make it from where frosted flakes fall to relaxin'
Yeah I fooled fools, used tricks on silly rabbits
Did it just for kicks when I started out rapping
And I grew up in Maine so they said, "it'll never happen"
But we got the alphabet too, and I'm nasty:
Coming to kill it abilities
Some of the illest they ever did see and they love it
They haven't a crumb of my skill
And I'm sonning the dumbest of villains, I'm cunning
I stomached the summit, no vomiting from it
Above all the beef and the killing and bluffing
I'm bigger than something to bump when you're drunk and you're puffing your stuff, call me Spose!

[Hook]
Are you out of your brain!?
Rapping from Maine!?
You must be insane!
‘Cause you can't get there from here
Or delusional
Please quit the beats
And retreat to the cubicle
You can't get there from here
You must've lost your mind!
I mean, those rhymes
They were fine for the time
But you can't get there from here
You're from the eastern-most, northern-most, boredom-soaked state
You can't be great
You can't get there from here

[Outro]

Keep keep on

Luch and Eliza
Just keep keep on
To my man Foodstamp
Keep keep on and on and on and on
