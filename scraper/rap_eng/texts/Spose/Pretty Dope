[Intro: Kristina Kentigian]
Spizzy Spose
From the state of Maine

[Hook: Spose]
If Jay Z showed up to my video (that'd be pretty dope)
If we didn't kill the Cherokees and Seminoles (that'd be pretty dope)
If my girl showed up wearing minimal and handed me the medical
'Cause now it isn't criminal (that'd be pretty dope)
If we paid good money to the teachers (that'd be pretty dope)
If every hungry kid got a pizza (that'd be pretty dope)
If human beings weren't the worst creature
And Kendrick wanna donate me a feature, ayup (that'd be pretty dope)

[Verse 1: Spose]
If I was whipping by the bay side, sunny in the daytime
Riding in what Drake drives, sipping on a margarita
Probably bumping old Snoop, top down, roll through
Better than ever like I was Spose 2 (that'd be pretty dope)
If I never had to be a old dude (that'd be pretty dope)
If I had my own mansion, own zoo (that'd be pretty dope)
Dunkin Donuts wanna sponsor me with Cold Brew
And if I asked my homie if anybody died today and he was like "nah, dude"
That'd be pretty dope if we stayed kids, cause the world's ruined by adults
If I had a castle with a moat and put every asshole in catapults and let it go like
If Obama hit me on the text
And let me know he's loaning me the jet
It'd be pretty dope if all of that came true, but it won't
So everybody sing the hook like you'll die if you don't

[Hook: Spose]
If Jay Z showed up to my video (that'd be pretty dope)
If we didn't kill the Cherokees and Seminoles (that'd be pretty dope)

'Cause now it isn't criminal (that'd be pretty dope)
If we paid good money to the teachers (that'd be pretty dope)
If every hungry kid got a pizza (that'd be pretty dope)
If human beings weren't the worst creature
And Kendrick wanna donate me a feature, ayup (that'd be pretty dope)

[Verse 2: Spose & Kristina Kentigian]
If Beyonc√© showed up at my show at the merch table
And she said "hey, let's be friends" (that'd be pretty dope)
If I didn't have to purchase four hundred other channels
Just so I could get ESPN (that'd be pretty dope)
If we had world peace in every nation (that'd be pretty dope)
If every child's given education (that'd be pretty dope)
If someone had a revelation, passed some legislation
Made it so elation is an obligation on every occasion that'd be
Pretty dope if someone'd save my soul
That'd be pretty dope if they did
'Cause I'm not trying to go to hell if that exists
Because I been sinning since I was ten years old
That'd be pretty dope for a white guy
If Wyclef rolled up, sang the hook one time

[Hook]
If Jay Z showed up to my video (that'd be pretty dope)

If human beings weren't the worst creature

[Verse 3]
If nobody ever killed BIG and then he heard Eminem's Slim Shady LP
And when he went in the lab to make album number 3
They had a track together both at their peak (that'd be pretty dope)
If my shoes never came untied (that'd be pretty dope)
If I woke up and Donald Trump died (that'd be pretty dope)
If there was nothing I had ever done wrong
And people thought Spose had more than one song (that'd be pretty dope)
If there was a marathon and I could win it without getting winded only after like a mile or two (that'd be pretty dope)
If your twenties wasn't spending a while confused
If there wasn't any child abuse (that'd be pretty dope)
If I could go and wipe the slate clean (that'd be pretty dope)
If the Celtics won banner 18 (that'd be pretty dope)
If I didn't get chlamydia in India from this chick Lydia --
I'm just kidding I don't have chlamydia, I've never been to India

[Hook]
If Jay Z showed up to my video (that'd be pretty dope)
If we didn't kill the Cherokees and Seminoles (that'd be pretty dope)
If my girl showed up wearing minimal and handed me the medical
'Cause now it isn't criminal (yeah yeah)
If we paid good money to the teachers (that'd be pretty dope)
If every hungry kid got a pizza (that'd be pretty dope)
If human beings weren't the worst creature
And Kendrick wanna donate me a feature, ayup (that'd be pretty dope)

[Outro: Kristina Kentigian & Spose]
If this album went right to number one
And if there weren't any guns
And I was bumping Chronic 2001
Riding under the sun
Well that'd be pretty dope
Yeah yeah
That'd be pretty dope
That'd be pretty dope
That'd be pretty dope
That'd be pretty dope
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
