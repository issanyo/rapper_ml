[Intro: Spose and Cam Groves]
Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome
I don't necessarily have to be here for this
Can I...
I'm gonna keep the headphones though

[Chorus: Spose]
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
No you're not, dude, don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voice mail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall

[Verse 1: Spose]
You know my pants sag low (low)
Even though (though) that went out of style
Like ten years ago (go)
Spose, I got the swagger of a cripple
I got little biceps
Getting fatter in the middle
And lyrically I'm not the best
Physically the opposite of Randy Moss, and yet
So preposterous
Feel the awesomeness
The most obnoxious guest up at the sausage fest
Oh yes
The girls are repulsed
So I hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult
I'm as nervous as my cat, ol' Dirty Curtis
All my writtens are bitten and
All my verses are purchased
Me? I'll never date an actress
Got too many back zits
Plus, my whole home aroma is cat piss
Every show I do is poorly promoted
And if you like this
It's cause my little sister wrote it

[Chorus: Spose]
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude, don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voicemail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall

[Scratching]
The swagger of a cripple

[Verse 2: Spose]
Check it out
I'm from Maine and I don't hunt (nope)
And I can't ski
Smoke weed but I can't roll blunts
Find me whipped by my wifey
My neck not icy
Eatin' at McDonald's because Subway's pricey
Ha, and my uni-brow is plucked
Just asked my mom if I could borrow ten bucks
She's like, "For what?
Blunt wraps and some Heinekens?
You skinny prick, go get a gym membership and vitamins!"
I'm like, "Mom please, don't blame it on me
I got my bad habits from you, Dad, and Aunt Steve."
My attitude's sour but my futon's sweet
And the hair on my ass, it is Jumanji
Suit un-tailored, ringtone Taylor Swift
Can't tweet up on my Twitter
'Cause I haven't done shit
Bank account red, body ungroomed
The only good thing about me is I'm off stage soon

[Chorus: Spose]
I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voicemail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall
I'm awesome

[Scratched]
Suit untailored, ringtone Taylor Swift

[Verse 3: Spose]
Furthermore I am cornier than Ethanol
Cheesier than Provolone
I spent ages eight to ten living in a motorhome
With a ego the size of Tim Duncan
Even though I got shit for brains like a blumpkin
I'm twenty-four, serving lobster rolls
Because I spent a decade filling Optimos
And I'm not even the bomb in Maine
On my game, I'm only about as sexy as John McCain
Now put your hands up
If you have nightmares
If you wouldn't man up if there was a fight here
If you got dandruff
If you drink light beer
I'm outta breath

[Chorus: Spose]
But I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voicemail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall
I'm awesome
