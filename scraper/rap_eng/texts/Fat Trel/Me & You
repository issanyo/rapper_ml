I tried so many times
I really think I failed you (I failed you)
I know you miss it
You remember when I held you (When I held you)
I wasn't fuckin' no whore
I want the real you (I want the real you)
You said my heart, it was cold
I said I feel you (I feel you)
You said you leavin'
I said hold on (Hold on)
Like who this bitch
But I don't know her (Know her)
Bae, you my bitch
You like my soldier (Soldier)
Come give me kids
Just lemme hold ya (Just lemme hold ya)

You know I fuck with your father
I never had mine (Had mine)
You know I fuck with your mother
Gave her diamond rings (Diamond rings)
You know I fuck with your brother

Back when I cheated, I was stupid

But it get lonely in the stu
Just makin' songs, bae (Songs, bae)

[Verse 2]
They locked me up
You beat that visitation door down, huh
Like, "What you want?"
"I'm at the store now", huh
"Jolly Ranchers and some peanut chew" (Hahahaha)
"You must be high, bae"
"You so stupid, boo" (Yeah)
I fucked my re-up money up
I know you got me, bae (I know you got me, bae)
I put that pistol to his face
You had to stop me, bae (You had to stop me, bae)
I almost shot your brother, bae
But you got in the way (You got in the way)
I was just high up out my mind
I was trippin', bae (Up out my mind)
You hold my drinks when I eat it all (Eat it all)
Go grab the whole thang and heat it up (Heat it up)
You rub me down and I'm gon' beat it up (Beat it up)
I'm 'bout to leave, but you dont' need none (Need none)

Hello?
Hey, where you at?
At the studio
Where your boy at
Right here
Tell him get on the phone right quick
Come get the phone, bruh

[Chorus]
I tried so many times
I really think I failed you (I failed you)
I know you miss it
You remember when I held you (When I held you)
I wasn't fuckin' no whore
I want the real you (I want the real you)
You said my heart, it was cold
I said I feel you (I feel you)
You said you leavin'
I said hold on (Hold on)
Like who this bitch
But I don't know her (Know her)
Bae, you my bitch
