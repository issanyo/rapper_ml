[Verse 1: Millyz]
8 balls and quarters, 62 is my orders
8 balls and quarters, 62 is my orders
Sipping on this lean, got me slow like tortoise
Run the dope like Portis, no, I don’t take orders
You snitching, wearing recorders
Man, the shit's so mean
Fuck up out of my fortress
All my bitches is gorgeous
All my liquors imported
You confidential informants
I’d rather die than live dormant
That’s the way that I’m on it
Said word Hov, I’m serving O's and this work is whiter than Orbit
Vision, slightly distorted, my Haitian homie's deported
Mwen pa blanc mwen ayisyen, I buy it then I transport it
You rappers getting extorted, I serve ‘em soft and they snort it
She keep the dope in her closet, that pussy dripping like faucet

[Bridge]
She smoking Swishers to the face
Body moving to the bass
I’mma pop another perc
Told the bitch I got that work

[Hook]
8 balls and quarters, 62 my orders
8 balls and quarters, 62 my orders
8 balls and quarters, 62 my orders
8 balls and quarters, 8 balls and quarters

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
It started in search of quarters, 8 balls and quarters
30 clip for them killers, long dick for your daughters
I just like to spoil her, 62 is my order
Whip it right when I bake it, and the whole thing what I'm making
My killers killing, no faking
I run it down and I chase ‘em
I copped a pound and I faced it
No witness and no traces
Pockets filled with them faces
Gold bottles, that’s Aces
South Beach with my Haitians
Nigga, we ain’t got no patience
Foreign bitch, she rolling
Nice, thick and I'm open
Taste test in this ocean
Pop a pill and I’m stroking
And she gave me the smoke
Her boyfriend didn’t notice
Counting money, she focused
30 shots, no loafin'

[Bridge]
She smoking Swishers to the face
Body moving to the bass
I’mma pop another perc
Told the bitch I got that work

[Hook]
8 balls and quarters, 62 my orders
8 balls and quarters, 62 my orders
8 balls and quarters, 62 my orders
8 balls and quarters, 8 balls and quarters

Bounce bitch, make it bounce bitch
I serve 8 balls and quarters by the ounce bitch
Yeah, bounce bitch, make it bounce bitch
I serve 8 balls and quarters by the ounce bitch
8 balls and quarters, 8 balls and quarters
