[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I'ma get fresh today, might fuck a op bitch today (yeah, woah)
I'ma go price today, just tote the .9 today (drank, just get it)
Might have a shoot out today, just stay inside today (rahh, let's get it)
Don't come outside today, it's gonna rain today (too late, rahh)
Just get your umbrella
Now get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella
Just get your umbrella (it's rainin' bullets)
Just get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella (rahh)
Just get your umbrella (it's rainin' bullets, it's rainin' bullets)
Just get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella
Just keep your umbrella, it might rain today

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
Go, go, 30's and 50's and 100's and choppers just makin' it rain (brrrrrrr)
We send them oppers to doubters, I promise you'll fuck with the gang (fuck with the gang)
We don't be worried, no problems, I promise we not the same (nah, we ain't the same)
She probably fucking with me cause Iâ€™m gleeshy, you is a lame(mwah)
Go get your umbrella, I prolly pop off with barettas (with barettas)
My new bitch is yella and she gettin' money, it's all for the cheddar (the bank)
Her pussy is better but I want her sister, I heard it was wetter (mwah)
I hope she don't tell her, she tweakin', she thinkin' she wanted the fellas (say what?)
And I'm doin' better, she want this dick, if she eat I'ma let her (I'ma let her)
In the bank with the teller, all of this money I fuck up the weather
Giuseppe's the leather
Dressed in designer like we won't impress ya
Giuseppe's the leather
We dressed in designer like we won't impress ya

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I'ma get fresh today, might fuck a op bitch today (yeah, woah)
I'ma go price today, just tote the .9 today (drank, just get it)
Might have a shoot out today, just stay inside today (rahh, let's get it)
Don't come outside today, it's gonna rain today (too late, rahh)
Just get your umbrella
Now get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella
Just get your umbrella (it's rainin' bullets)
Just get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella (rahh)
Just get your umbrella (it's rainin' bullets)
Just get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella
Just keep your umbrella, it might rain today

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
Rain, rain go away, they shootin' round (shootin' round)
TJ tryna whack a bitch, he will follow (will follow)
I'ma sip this Actavis and get you to go (get you to go)
We don't fuck with fashion, we don't fuck with umbrellas
All this rain, window pane, 30 pops, gang gangs
See the watch, see the chain, you are not the same
I'm the shit, who's to blame? That's your boyfriend, what's his name?
I'm as hot as fire flames, every time the tire change
If you not the die gang, I feel sorry for the lames
Every time my .9 bang, throw a party for the lames
If you not the die gang, I feel sorry for the lames
Every time my .9 bang, throw a party for the lames

Now get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella
Just get your umbrella (it's rainin' bullets)
Just get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella (rahh)
Just get your umbrella (it's rainin' bullets)
Just get your umbrella, umbrella, umbrella
Just keep your umbrella, it might rain today
