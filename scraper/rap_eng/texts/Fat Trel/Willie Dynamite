[Intro: Fat Trel]
What you like, right?
You like what you see? Yeah? Me too
Come over here, let me talk to you for a minute
And sit down
And, bitch, I know you know Harry Fraud too, heh

[Bridge: Fat Trel]
I know you heard I keep a bitch, my bitch a roller
Work first, she gon' fuck me when it's over
She love a rider, I love a roller
I love it when she ride, when she do that, I control her
I never trust her, I never hold her
I just wanna train her, you know, motor

[Hook: Fat Trel] (x3)
You know I'm lying, right? Come get your mind right
Open your mouth, I'm tryin' see what your mind like

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
Okay, I woke up to a bitch yelling in my face
Had to smack her down, put that pussy back in place
Make her snort a eighth, lick it off the plate
Throw that in the bank, let my accountant court the rate
Make her walk a mile with some heels and a smile
She return, let her rest, let her blow a pound of loud
Tell her "pipe down", I'll Ike a bitch now
When she make a hundred thou', she be making papi proud
Had to sit her down, let her know her worth
Buy that bitch a car while you buy yo' bitch a purse
Told that bitch to pray, make her go to church
Come home, change clothes, make her go to work

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Right, that mouthpiece, got her that Giuseppe shit
Suck the soul out a nigga, she a specialist
Get-a-crib-out-a-nigga type of neck she give
Have you strung out, that's a definite
That mind got ballers out of bread
Got hustlers out of shine and all she spend is time
But she down for whatever, down to fuck
Down to get cheddar, down to hold a Beretta
She a trill bitch I build wit'
Fuck around and get bills wit' on some real shit
Word, shit, I molded her
Taught her how to shuffle through the streets
Slurp a nigga but no spit, not on my new sheets, no

[Bridge + Hook]

[Refrain: Fat Trel] (x2)
Cause when you see my ho, you wanna eat my ho
When you see my ho, you gon' eat my ho
When you see my ho, you gon' eat my ho
But don't sleep with that ho, you'll never leave that ho

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Diamond in the back, sun rooftop
Bitch, kiss the pinky ring, spit shine these rocks
Bruiser and them Slutty Boyz, hoes wanna suck the boy
Eating so much pussy, we ain't gotta eat no dinner, boy
Mauris with the buckles on 'em, looking like "smoke something"
Bitch, no fronting, pimpin' never stole nothing
Bitch, what that ass worth? Help you with your workin' it
Hustling them three holes like I was selling cardigans
Check you off that rainbow, put you on right angle
All you gotta is get the squares with the triangle
Keep the circle small, we for sho' gon' ball
Jewels all like the opera at Carnegie Hall

[Outro]
Baby, don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
