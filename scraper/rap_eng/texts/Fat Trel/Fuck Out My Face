[Intro]
Who you want to pop big dog

[Hook]
I get it for the 19 time
And we want to talk about drink
Look at that life that we try tonight
Do you want to pop it dog
Or we just going to fuss all I get it for a nice G price
When a nice price dike on a dick she freak I’m a eat off
I grease off and I know she like
And I don’t fear streets I’m a mother fucking G mean
Neet no OT I told them get the fuck out my space
I don’t play those games I don’t fuck in those lanes
If you don’t get to eat what I ask
That’s your mistake make a cheese on my face
I’m a pimp from the age
I told them get the fuck out my face
I don’t play those games I don’t fuck in those lanes
If you don’t get to eat what I ask
That’s your mistake make a cheese on my face
I’m a pimp from the age

[Verse 1]
Happy mother fucker I’ll be coming from the gutter
Learned to hustle yea he got it from his mother
Money getting different you switching you seeing colours
For every minute I’m getting it I’m sending it to my brother
Stunting in the summer my stripper hitting the hummer
I ain’t gettin no younger I need to get the numbers
White dope runner strap toke gunner and I
Am strapped with the crease like the white ghost hunters
I don’t feel a cop unless I write those numbers
I don’t feel the rock for fucking them undercover
If I get locked lil bro drop a block I’ll be sneaking and
Eating in the on top
Those niggers drop numbers but trust me I never rocked
And then niggers be acting like a mother fucking cop
A bad bitch acting like a mother fucking thot
So i don’t want sex just a mother fucking top
Go feast nigga make a hoe goes crazy
With a bitch in a house sipping on Berberine
Shit ain’t be the same since they kill my nigga
Wolk man killers go crazy
Go fiest nigga go hoe quick go crazy
In stripper house go crazy sipping on berbaine
Shit ain’t be the same since they kill my nigga
Wolk man killers go crazy
Go fiest nigga go hoe quick go crazy

For every minute I’m getting it I’m sending it to my brother
Stunting in the summer my stripper hitting the hummer
