[Verse 1: Q Da Fool]
When it's time, it's time to ride nigga, it's overdue
Finna show 'em what soldiers do, two-two-threes goin' through you
I done did everything, I don't got nothin' else to prove
And I done sold everything, I don't got nothin' else to move
I was runnin' around with Wink but that nigga was leavin' clues
So next time I see that nigga I'ma smoke him out his shoes
And I don't trust everybody, that's just not what real niggas do
You don't gotta talk about it nigga, if you gon' shoot, fuck nigga just shoot
I just cut my nigga off 'cause he told the judge the truth
I had to smack my bitch off 'cause that bitch lips loose
Don't be tellin' your friends my business, where I'm at and what I do
Don't be worried 'bout where I'm at, I'm somewhere with my twenty-two
I still got snipers on the roof, I still got shooters off the boot
I still got choppers in my closet, think that shit run in my roots
Middle finger to the police, tryna hang me by a noose
I'm just tryna buy that Rollie, buy that brand new Bentley coupe
Say they want that real, this right here that real
It was time to do that time, and that pussy nigga he squealed
And I swear I love my niggas, you can put them niggas in my will
And all my victims don't hear it, when I'm dead, pay the bill

[Chorus: Q Da Fool]
Chopper out, my chopper out
Nigga made me bring my chopper out
Bitch I been workin', never been a slouch
Look at the window, chopper hangin' out
Let a nigga try run in my house
I got the AR-15 right in the couch
I got the drop 'cause he runnin' his mouth
Brung my chopper out, he made me bring my chopper out
I brung my chopper out, you want some smoke, we poppin' out
Walk down with that thirty, ain't no shells poppin' out
He made me bring that chopper out, graow

[Verse 2: Ever]
Nah I ain't takin' no breaks, niggas stay plottin' on takin' my place
Yeah they hate but they smile in my face
If we pop him we ain't leavin' no trace
Fake love make you hate love
Shoot him long range like I'm K. Love
Niggas they hate 'cause I came up
If you ain't the plug, get your weight up, uh-huh
Chopper spittin' out a hundred rounds
Chopper knock a nigga out of bounds
Say he real, nigga how that sound?
Heard he squealed, now he can't come around
Murder shooters but I got some in town
Say they don't like me but look at me now
Rap niggas steady taking my style
But fuck 'em 'cause I'ma be here for a while
Whole lot of paper bring whole lot of haters
Whole lot of paper, now they ask for favors
Just got a new plug, he bringin' them flavors
If it ain't 'bout that bread then I won't see you later
It's Ever nigga

[Chorus: Q Da Fool]
Chopper out, my chopper out
Nigga made me bring my chopper out
Bitch I been workin', never been a slouch
Look at the window, chopper hangin' out
Let a nigga try run in my house
I got the AR-15 right in the couch
I got the drop 'cause he runnin' his mouth
Brung my chopper out, he made me bring my chopper out
I brung my chopper out, you want some smoke, we poppin' out
Walk down with that thirty, ain't no shells poppin' out
He made me bring that chopper out, graow

[Verse 3: Fat Trel]
Man I can't hesitate to bring my choppers out
I'm the Burger King of beef, my whopper out
I'm sixteen, I'm trappin' out my mama house
I spent a check with my connect, the llamas out
He keepin' more cheese than me, the fuck you talkin' 'bout?
We bring them junkies to the front and walk 'em out
In a new whip with an old K
We shootin' shit like the stone age
All of my niggas they don't play
Been with the killin', I'm OJ
I really live what the songs say
He tryna swerve in the wrong lane
Police know me by my whole name
My OG's say I'm in the wrong game
We never walk with revolvers
You got a problem, I solve it
All of my niggas retarded
He might not see you tomorrow, gang

[Outro: Q Da Fool]
Chopper out, my chopper out
Nigga made me bring my chopper out, uh
Chopper out, my chopper out
Nigga made me bring my chopper out
