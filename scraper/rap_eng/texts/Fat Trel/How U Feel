(ain't no more lean)
Give a fuck bout the next nigga
I get money for real
I met that pussy on Ocean Drive
I gave dat pussy a pill
It's 50 shots in da Mac clip
It's either kill or be killed
I got da pot doing backflips
My paper like somebody momma left me a will
I'm foreal my nigga do what you feel
Cuz rich niggas they goin do what they feel
Can't fold, Lips closed they sealed..
And since I'm rich she let me cop me a feel
We rich niggas we goin do what we feel..

(Verse 1)
I come from the city where it's no pity
Niggas walking wit hand choppas and 100s of 50s
Deese niggas bitches
Call dey momma tell her come & get em
It's either that or shoot him ,shoot whoever wit him
Hope Lord forgive me
I'm soo silly , No he prolly won't
She say she love you let me fuck dat mean she prolly don't
Dat thot was shown
It was known from the get-go
From the jump come meet me at da Citgo
I got da pump
All deese niggas wan run wit us
So it's obvious the see dat we is number 1
And I ain't fucking wit a freak unless it's 3 of us
One sucking
One fucking while I'm rolling up

(Chorus)

I Give a fuck bout the next nigga
I get money for real
I met that pussy on Ocean Drive (I met dat pussy on Ocean)
I gave dat pussy a pill (She just popped her a pill)
It's 50 shots in da Mac clip (It's 50 shots in the BOW!)
It's either kill or be killed
I got da pot doing backflips
My paper like somebody momma left me a will
I'm foreal my nigga do what you feel (What you feel)
Cuz rich niggas they goin do what they feel
Can't fold,Lips closed they sealed..
And since I'm rich she let me cop me a feel
We rich niggas we goin do what we feel

(Verse 2)

In the Jungle wit Gorillas
Eating pussies for dinner
