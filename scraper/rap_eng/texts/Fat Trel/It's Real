It's so real, it's so real round my way
It's so real, it's so real round my way
It's so real, it's so real round my way
It's so real, it's so real round my way
It's so real, it's so real round my way
It's so real, it's so real round my way
It's so real, it's so real round my way
It's so real, it's so real round my way

[Verse 1]
I'm at the plaza, on hundred five
Bitch ass nigga better run and hide
We finna hit dat spot tonight
Guaranteed  , have my gun inside
Guarenteed have your ho's with us
Baby momma and lil' sister
Don't act like you don't wanna smoke with us
Talking paper, we deal with you
Used to have too much patience
Fuck humble, I'm done waiting
Specialize in farm raising
Fuck tazing, I'm gun raising
Gun control my nuts, ho
I'm strapped up and my nuts low
Yeah, I let them shits hang
I mean why should I give a fuck, fo?
My nigga dead and his momma crying
Hundred dollar bills I gotta find
Politician do a lot of lyin
Street nigga do a lot of crime
Give a fuck how y'all hoes feel
Have all the bread or it's no deal
Bitch nigga better be so chill
Cause round my way is so real

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Stretch the deal, shake it real, pussy niggas get killed
Elementary recruit, second grade in the field
Third grade on the block, fourth grade popping pill
Fifth grade popping still, sixth grade, he got killed
When I hit the seventh grade I started fucking for real
Fuckin bitches in hallways and gambling all day
Fuck me up in UUV when I touched the eighth grade
Same time Sweepy introduced me to Ace of Spades
Drop core, stunting, middle finger to ninth grade
College could never bring me the dollars the nights gave
Travel to California, my new bitch is wife made
Ripping up the swishers, me and Chip are in the hot grades

[Hook]
