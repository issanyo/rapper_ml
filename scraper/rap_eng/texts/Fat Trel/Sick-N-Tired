[Intro]
Uh oh
Turn my mic down just a little bit
Gang, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus]
Uh, I'm getting tired of the same old lame hoes
I just  [?] policies in their plain clothes (Plain Clothes)
I be show you how to make a bank roll
Only time I be upset when the bank close (Bank close)
5, 10, 15 hundred running (15 hundred running)
She gonna fall forever, really keep em' coming (Keep em' coming)
They say you doing better when they see the money (See the money)
I want this forever I want all the hundreds (Want all the hundreds)

[Verse 1]
[?]
I just lost a way to [?]
I still check my pistol to the ball game
My P.O know that I be hustle all day
Instagram Live in the hallways
Gelado by the pound, nigga cocaine
She said you should come home we on the same thing, so?
I said catch me if you can, bitch
Must of pop a Xan, bitch
Percacet make me emotional, I dumped a bad bitch
Trust is not a passion cause' I ain't into passion
Spend a couple on a Gucci belt I gotta have it

[Chorus]
Uh, I'm getting tired of the same old lame hoes
I just  [?] policies in their plain clothes (Plain Clothes)
I be show you how to make a bank roll
Only time I be upset when the bank close (Bank close)
5, 10, 15 hundred running (15 hundred running)
She gonna fall forever, really keep em' coming (Keep em' coming)
They say you doing better when they see the money (See the money)
I want this forever I want all the hundreds (Want all the hundreds)

[Verse 2]
Hold up, I can count a lot of cash
I can stuff it in the bag (Bag)
I can go up in the Julla
Make a pussy nigga mad
With the work make a move
Get it twerking in the school
I got a lot of shit to lose
But I ain't got shit to prove
I be the one to be the block down
In the kitchen with the pot now
Water whippin' in the shop now
Make it turn to a rock now
I remember I was locked down
White letters to the hoes
Hooking up in the microwave
Pressing niggas for the phone
Young nibba [?]
Now he smoking by the zone (Zones)
They will hate you when you're here
Better love you when you're gone
I can never do same
Here to fuck up another game
Two shots to the brain *gun sounds*
Fuckin' with a lane

[Chorus]
Uh, I'm getting tired of the same old lame hoes
I just  [?] policies in their plain clothes (Plain Clothes)
I be show you how to make a bank roll
Only time I be upset when the bank close (Bank close)
5, 10, 15 hundred running (15 hundred running)
She gonna fall forever, really keep em' coming (Keep em' coming)
They say you doing better when they see the money (See the money)
I want this forever I want all the hundreds (Want all the hundreds)
