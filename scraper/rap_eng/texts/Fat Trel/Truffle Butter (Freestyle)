[Verse 1]
Thinking out loud
Bout' to fuck another nigga daughter right now
I’m about to mix the molly with the water right now
I got bitches on the mission across the border right now
Road killers are you here?
You’re a killer right now
With the pretty bitches and drug dealers right now
I would drill her
I don’t really feel it right now
Finna text her
But she with another nigga right now
Bumpin Lil Wayne
Buy bitch a car before I buy bitch a ring
She already got a man
I don’t really understand
I only fucked once
Still left them with a bang
Im the Motherfuckin' Man
I got a plan right now
I’m at the country about to buy another nigga land right now
Out in Philly got a nigga in the can right now
I call milli for a couple hundred grand right now
All day, type and hit the roadway with the AK
[?] with the bombay
Hanging out the window on the one way
Young nigga, what’s up?
Gang, Double MG, Maybach Murder Game Nigga
Bang

[Verse 2]
I'm too fucked up
In the two-seater, two freaks, two blunts
Call the police cause I'm too rushed up
And I'm looking for the lean
Need two cups dup
Get by
Bitch I'm high right now
Will fight , but a nigga too fly right now
Her pussy wet but it’s lookin’ a little dry right now
Bitch I’m in the motherfucking sky right now
Spend the blue cheddar
Bitches in the kitchen flippin’ a cool whip
I already hit them
I’mma need a new lisp
Got so many bitches
Don’t know what to do with them
Young Nigga Fool with it
Couple bitches in the paint no rain
I’mma make her whippin’
Make her sniffin’ cocaine
[?]
Yo nigga go crazy
All white but ain't no racist
Im the type to put bitches on the plane
Fat Trel nigga
Slutty Boy Gang Georgetown on the way
Georgetown
