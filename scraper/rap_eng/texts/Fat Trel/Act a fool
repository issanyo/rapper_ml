[Intro: Fat Trel]


Pack the tools act a fool, pack the tools

My young niggas act a fool (Gang)

Act a fool my young nigga pack the tools

Fuck them teachers bitch we tot them strappers too
Shoot it loud make a nigga make the news
(Shoot it loud make a nigga make the news)

Yous a lie bitch i told you yous a lie (yous a mother fuckin lie)
Hundred guns on the guys who is you (on the guys who is you) hundred guns who is you (who is you)
Hundred guns, hundred guys (who is you)
On the guys (who is you)

[verse 1: Chris bo]
Okay now how they count me out like Ima lose (Ima lose)
How many bodies got to drop for me to prove
Bitch in the hottest southeast we call back them rugers
I need this whip get out your shit call jack the uber
Man free my guys all my niggas and they lifes
Hundred bodies, hundred pounds , on indictments
Hundred rounds we put lasers on the rifles
If she can whip it like it's yams ima wife her
Bitch look like [?] she want me to be her usher (no)
I got a confession wanna crush her
You with the shits hop in this whip we spend a duffel and that ain't even flexing what a muscle
Bitch I need it now don't go no patience
Hundreds , fifties , twenties want a bracelet

Steak and shrimp and lobster on a plates and they just mad because they ain't eating nathans
