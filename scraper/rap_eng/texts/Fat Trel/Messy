[Intro]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in my section, goin' hard, I'm reckless
And that bitch is so wet, way she kissin' my neck gave me an erection
Got some shit on the flight, what I did in one night, I just sent her to Texas
Grandma on the phone, in love with her voice, I needed a blessing
Bitch, I'm so extra, goin' hard, I'm mixin'
I'm still in the kitchen, I'm whippin' it right, I'm stretchin' the extra
Fall back and I catch it, that shit was a blessing
Better than gettin' indicted, better than gettin' arrested

[Verse 1]
Poppin' shit about a Bentley truck, my baby pulled up on me in a Lambo
I just went and put the twenties up, a nigga purchased up all of the ammo
You know a nigga don't give a fuck, I was really honkin', fishin' in camo
Lend a bitch pussy a hand low, and that bitch bust out the bando, whoa, whoa
Versace shoppin', you know papi got it
Steak and calamari at a private party
I cannot fuck on no thottie thottie
I'ma need me a lil' homebody
I'ma need me a lil' bad bitch
Pussy so good, wrote a song 'bout it
Niggas ain't goin' home 'bout it
In the jail fightin' over phones 'bout it
I cannot fuck on no nobody, like A-Rod, I'm showin' body
Baby bad with a bum body, I ain't gon' tell nobody
I'ma take you out to dinner, mami, had a baby daddy, I ain't know 'bout it
Steak and fish and chicken, Benihana
Had a hoodie pocket, they ain't know 'bout

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in my section, goin' hard, I'm reckless
And that bitch is so wet, way she kissin' my neck gave me an erection
Got some shit on the flight, what I did in one night, I just sent her to Texas
Grandma on the phone, in love with her voice, I needed a blessing
Bitch, I'm so extra, goin' hard, I'm mixin'
I'm still in the kitchen, I'm whippin' it right, I'm stretchin' the extra
Fall back and I catch it, that shit was a blessing
Better than gettin' indicted, better than gettin' arrested

[Verse 2]
All my niggas doin' murders and robberies, police labeled me a prodigy
Son of a bitch, they was callin' me, son of God, I gotta be
Had to call my nigga Visa up, tell him we don't need apologies
Made me go and put the Beamer up, you gon' make me go inside of me
Real nigga, I gotta be
Same nigga that draw down when he saw the opposition, spotted me
Had to make it out a tight squeeze
Had to show a nigga fake love just to make money, they ain't like me
Had to fly my niggas out of town, bitch, West Coast just to sight see
You can love me, ain't gon' like me
I got them shooters like Ali
I'm on the beach where the night's free
Pussy good and the price cheap
Want a hood, I got a nice three
Niggas droppin' bodies like they legal
Lil' fish, bitch, the right time
Nigga ballin' on 'em like an eagle, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in my section, goin' hard, I'm reckless
And that bitch is so wet, way she kissin' my neck gave me an erection
Got some shit on the flight, what I did in one night, I just sent her to Texas
Grandma on the phone, in love with her voice, I needed a blessing
Bitch, I'm so extra, goin' hard, I'm Mexican
I'm still in the kitchen, I'm whippin' it right, I'm stretchin' the extra
Fall back and I catch it, that shit was a blessing
Better than gettin' indicted, better than gettin' arrested
