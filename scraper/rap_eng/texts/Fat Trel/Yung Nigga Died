[Intro]
JD on tha track

[Verse1]
I can take the pain away from you
From your side from your side
Since my young nigga die nigga die why
Rolling all the time I keep the tear
Because my real nigga die nigga die why
Those bitches ask me why I cry
But they don’t know my young nigga die
Shooters out there in fear facing 5 plus life
My younger home facing time
I just got a call saying my young nigga die
They say they caught him loafing so
They put a shot in his eyes
Why was they out there now we will never know why
I just know he left his soul to heaven he fly
Back when we were young I remember the time
When we had all the money all the hoes
IN the line bitches were fine
Never had no problem when committing a crime
But that was just what they thought us
We were fit to survive
I can’t even cry but hell I miss you sometimes
Love and treat your little children
Like them little nigga was mine
And every time I see them I see that look in them eyes
The miss you and love you until the end of time

[Hook]
I can take the pain away from you
From your side from your side
Since my young nigga die nigga die why
Rolling all the time I keep the tear
Because my real nigga die nigga die why
Those bitches ask me why I cry
But they don’t know my young nigga die
Shooters out there in fear facing 5 plus life
My younger home facing time

[Verse2]
Hard nights long days me turn wrong way
Frontline head down drop out he dead now
I can't do anything to bring homes back
Little moving with my own strap
I will be checking my phone still
Pulling up to my show strapped
He lost his life but he but it's better than been broke
So we still out on them streets
And still trapping them same hoes
Brother up in the street with them jumpers
With numbers and clean soap
Then they seen us brothers selling then shit
That the phenes smoke
When you were roaming i was with you
When the feds was out to get us
Youngers moving through the trenches and
Everything we like to see is like
And I know that I can’t take the pain away
But I know you in a better place

[Hook]
I can take the pain away from you
From your side from your side
Since my young nigga die nigga die why
Rolling all the time I keep the tear
Because my real nigga die nigga die why
Those bitches ask me why I cry
But they don’t know my young nigga die
Shooters out in fear facing life 5 plus
My younger faces some time
I can’t take a pain away
From your side from your side
Since my young nigga die nigga die why
Rolling all the time I keep the tear
Because my real nigga die nigga die why
