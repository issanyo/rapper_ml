(Intro)
Yeah
You don't understand babbio, I'm trying to save your marriage

(Verse)
Now everytime you call, I pull up on the double
All this quick be cheating shit, gon get you in trouble
I'm not wit the arguments, I don't like to tussle
I just like to stack up all my chips, like its ruffles
Back when we first started, promised I wouldn't touch you
After that we fucked, you promised we wouldn't cuddle
Funny how it changed, now you tell me you love me
And I'm the only one and ain't nobody above me
Hustling, youngin, thuggin, fat and ugly with money
All my bitches models, couple thotties with tummies
Pull up in 2 seaters, maseratis or something
Flexing in the winter, in December, it's ours
Heard you had the baby, that's so crazy to hear
Imma make a visit, maybe twice out the year
And holla at the sister, as I exit the rear
Call my nigga slizz, he got chickens in here
Couple naked bitches in my kitchen, in here
Counting up the riches, all the digits is clear
Light another swisher, let's get lifted in here
Everyday is feeling like its Christmas, in here
I can't have an arguement, with niggas who I started with
I am not a prodigy, my style is flying ???
Mami used to rock it wit them niggas rocking moccasin
Studying the air space, I just took a rocket ship
ATM strip club, snuck the pocket rocket in
Niggas plotting heavy now, I could never let us down
Hit em wit da six shot, make me buss a seven round
Cut em up and toss him in Virginia, body never found
Ask me how I'm doing, bitch I'm chillin, living better now
You can keep the shoe fool, I just work towards cheddar now
Settle down, told my mama, she said "boy, you let her down"
Hella loud, in front of everybody, I was off the Molly
I ain't even care, it's like I ain't even there
It's like I'm blindsided, but I can see it clear
Hell yeah
All my 10 year niggas, still here
Right or wrong, imma ride for niggas till the end
Yeah
Till the end, yeah
