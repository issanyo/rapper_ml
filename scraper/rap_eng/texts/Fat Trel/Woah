Whoa ya’ll nigga get the money
Young nigga ride slow, dropped a 4 for the hundred
Young nigga roll with shotties
And your mama I can tell, lil trel somebody
Whoa ya’ll nigga get the money
Young nigga ride slow, dropped a 4 for the hundred
Young nigga roll with shotties
And your mama I can tell, lil trel somebody

[Verse 1]
I woke up so excited all these exotic bitches chasing me
Double M empire mommy pussy taste like morpholine
Thankfully I be getting money so respectfully
Prolly why these bitches and these niggas can’t get next to me
Stressin me n calling me they hope I got a extra P
Meanwhile shopping Beverly I had the wettest dream
Back forth to LA, like they be obsessed with me
Glettchi put her on a better thing I’m for everything
My coke and leaf is heavenly booming like it’s 70
White as Britney Spears bitch talking Kevin Featherly
I told my Bahamas bitch i hope you brought that extra key
Fucking around with Bless, phones had to shoot the whole thing
Changing my identity my bitch she just got a nose ring
Bitch you out of time but I’m a talk a whole thing
You just show her some she just here trying
To wet the whole scene
Ask I’m a park I’ll spark at the whole team

[Verse 2]
I woke up so excited got money and I like it
Your bitch is so trifling she sucking fucking and dyking
Usually I’m not talking to strangers they bringing diamonds
Usually when I be selling they tell me my thing is inspiring
All I see is camera police is doing wiring
Phone tap pull up to the track then we firing
I told my chicago bitch I hope you never lie to me
Cooker with me before she look like we hit the lottery
Cooling in the delery looking for a sluttery
Choppery get the floss start duggery
Shot the whole club up killing screaming cover me
Fucking around with wack Kale had to shoot the whole team
Changing my identity my bitch just got a nose ring
Meeting you at the half time but I’m a talk a whole thing
You just an associate bitch you is what the show bring
X at my spart at my I spark at the whole team
