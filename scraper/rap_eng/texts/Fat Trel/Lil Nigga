[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track
Billboard Hitmakers
Hundred bands for a kilo, nigga

[Chorus: Fat Trel]
I caught a bitch quick, I put her on time out, nigga
I'll blow a nigga mind out, nigga
You a scary motherfucker, like what the fuck you cryin' 'bout, nigga?
Goofy ass, what you lyin' 'bout, nigga?
Like hold on, wait, I don't really wanna play, lil' nigga
I just got a new K, lil' nigga
Watch what you say, get shot in your face, lil' nigga
On your block every day, lil' nigga
Like hold up, bae, I don't wanna go on a date with you
Baby, I don't wanna take no pictures
I'm just tryna hit you and forget I ever did it
I just want the skully like a motherfuckin' fitted
I'm just tryna beat you on the counter and the kitchen
Tell your girlfriend to mind her motherfuckin' business
I don't need a co-D, OG, who snitchin'?
I be in the coupe-coupe with the roof missin'

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
OG on the block, I just turned 28
I could get 'em on time, I could get 'em in late
Thirty-seven point eight for an off-white plate
They could make the bullshit and I could put it in your face
I remember sellin' dimes, that was back in '05
Put it all on the line for a new North Face
Take a look in my eyes and you knew that I was high
Niggas do this all the time, I don't really wan' wait
But I got it on my side when I ride, nigga
Even when the police outside, nigga
Y'all niggas just died, don't cry, nigga
Put a pistol in your hand and go and slide, nigga
Every time I take a bitch from 'round the way
And fill her pussy up with lake
A goofy bitch just wanna take a picture
Get the fuck out my face
You're just tryna make your baby daddy mad
I ain't tryna celebrate with you
I'm just tryna beat the pot, count cake with you
Probably in a new drop, i8 with you
Nigga living room like an arcade in it
Take the D out your mouth, put a K in it
Take the bitch out the trap, put a safe in it
Nigga fuck around and caught a new case with it
I'll beat the pussy up and you'll lay with it
And if she tastes better now you'll stay with it
Bitch stay with it

[Chorus: Fat Trel]
I caught a bitch quick, I put her on time out, nigga
I'll blow a nigga mind out, nigga
You a scary motherfucker, like what the fuck you cryin' 'bout, nigga?
Goofy ass, what you lyin' 'bout, nigga?
Like hold on, wait, I don't really wanna play, lil' nigga
I just got a new K, lil' nigga
Watch what you say, get shot in your face, lil' nigga
On your block every day, lil' nigga
Like hold up, bae, I don't wanna go on a date with you
Baby, I don't wanna take no pictures
I'm just tryna hit you and forget I ever did it
I just want the skully like a motherfuckin' fitted
I'm just tryna beat you on the counter and the kitchen
Tell your girlfriend to mind her motherfuckin' business
I don't need a co-D, OG, who snitchin'?
I be in the coupe-coupe with the roof missin'

[Verse 2: Z-Wayne]
Ridin' 'round in my new coupe with a new boo
Old bitch go cuckoo, she a loose screw
Loose screw with the deuce deuce, I was too cool
Turn up on me, act a fool fool, I'ma shoot you
Pretty bitch keep playin' with a nigga
Tryna dance on a nigga
Put the bands in the bitch tutu
Like what the fuck you sayin', lil' nigga?
Get your bands, lil' nigga
Make a move, nigga, what you wan' do?
Young nigga on the block, I just turned 21
The only thing I ever wanted was some money and a gun
Balenciaga runners on me, I ain't never had to run from a nigga
Young nigga shoot Glocks just for fun
Baby, I get the work and make it happen
She say she want a nigga who be trappin'
She say she want a nigga 'bout that action
When I'm the crib, I got it in the mattress
Lil' nigga, what you sayin', lil' nigga?
Stop playin', lil' nigga
You don't really want war with the goons
Thirty blow you like a fan, lil' nigga
Goddamn, lil' nigga
Come through and sweep shit like a broom
Stop wastin' my time, lil' bitch
Keep cryin' for the dick
You be lyin', bitch, what you wan' do?
Tell her pull up to the side, I'ma get with you
I'm only fuckin' if you got another bitch with you, I'm quick with it

[Chorus: Fat Trel]
I caught a bitch quick, I put her on time out, nigga
I'll blow a nigga mind out, nigga
You a scary motherfucker, like what the fuck you cryin' 'bout, nigga?
Goofy ass, what you lyin' 'bout, nigga?
Like hold on, wait, I don't really wanna play, lil' nigga
I just got a new K, lil' nigga
Watch what you say, get shot in your face, lil' nigga
On your block every day, lil' nigga
Like hold up, bae, I don't wanna go on a date with you
Baby, I don't wanna take no pictures
I'm just tryna hit you and forget I ever did it
I just want the skully like a motherfuckin' fitted
I'm just tryna beat you on the counter and the kitchen
Tell your girlfriend to mind her motherfuckin' business
I don't need a co-D, OG, who snitchin'?
I be in the coupe-coupe with the roof missin'
