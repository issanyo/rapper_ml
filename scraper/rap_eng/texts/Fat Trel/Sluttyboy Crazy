[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
So fuck the government, I'm on some fuck'em shit
I'm on some other lethal weapon Danny Glover shit
I heard your man snitchin' hotter then the oven mit
And free my nigga phone, fuck all that other shit
I pour that bubbly, I pour that bubbly
I'm pouring bubbly, I'm popping bubbly
I see jizzle, they on some other shit
I see band, 35, they on some sucker shit
Well I'm a baller baby, fuck that other team
And my pockets fatter then the average Korea team
I bet them niggas get to running when the see a beam
I bet them sucker's never sipping cups of clean lean
They locked three of my shooters up and got me traumatized
So everyday it's like I'm waiting on a homicide
Still fuck the other side, I'm with my brothers bitch
And I don't think that I can never trust another bitch
I'm finger fucking money, my dick celibate
It's too much paper chasing (bitch), she wasn't relevant
I'm sipping medicine, my nurse a veteran
I'm two stepping bitches reaching for my ladder man

[Hook: Fat Trel]
Cause they sluttyboy crazy, sluttyboy crazy
All these DC hoes they be sluttyboy crazy
Sluttyboy crazy, northeast crazy
These streets crazy, these hoes sluttyboy crazy, gang

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
Had it to go make a way on my own
Pick me up a pen and go write me a song
My momma was sick but my daddy was gone
I had to get that shit on my own
I started trapping it bought me a phone
Told everybody just to leave me alone
I disappeared and I went into my zone
Picked up the mic and I hung up the phone, gone
Now I'm just rapping for free
Nobody asked what had happened to me
I was just trapping and packing the piece
Never was lacking, I knew what would happen
I knew I was rapping, I knew I was wished
Still strap up and go through on a bitch
Hit a packer cause I knew he was a lick
Me and my G and I'm true to this shit
And he new to this shit
How it goes down
We fuck on them mazzies
We duck on them mazzies
We pass them around
She tuck and rolling busting them fours and holding them down
The Squirly with me 150 we busting the rounds
All they be bitches just searching for riches
I got a lawyer who the fuck is you kidding
I probably try you cause you really broke
You need some water and you need some soap
I pray to god so me I got whole
I'm on my job I never colofe
Send me a shipment I give it and go
Make sure you know that been in this robe

[Hook: Fat Trel]
Cause they sluttyboy crazy, sluttyboy crazy
All these DC hoes they be sluttyboy crazy
Sluttyboy crazy, northeast crazy
These streets crazy, these hoes sluttyboy crazy, gang
