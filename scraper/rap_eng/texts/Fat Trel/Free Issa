[Verse 1]
Pull up on a nigga in a 66
Feel like Gucci in the mix I'm too legit to quit
Phones woke up cut the place on
But first we take a K look at liaison
They gave my young'n 40 years, he told me stay strong
Fuck the city up cause he ain’t ever coming home [strong]
My new bitch had a baby should have left her alone
She used the situation as a stepping stone
I’m in the league with the lion I’m a tiger
I Go-rilla bitch a mother fucking fire I’m a fighter
I say this beat right here on motherfucking fire
Before my niggas with them kilos in them tires
I’m a king I’m God I’m a Messiah
You say I don’t run my city you's a liar
I remember robbing niggas with the pliers
Now I see my face on the flyers

[Hook]
My niggas say police is locking Issa up
Good nigga he just couldn't get that reefer up
I told Michala baby pray for me don’t wait for me
With all this money I’m making you can take a piece
I got niggas out in right cause I’m a stay green
My nigga just save side thats the same team
And I can’t sell my lean cause bitch I take lean
Driving while I’m sleeping in my day dream

[Verse 2]
Pull up on a nigga in an 88
My momma only person I appreciate
I swear I love my choppa he an instigator
He say his heart cold like a refridgerator
I just robbed a nigga for a Northface
Highway speed chase I can't miss the court date
My bitch just called me told that the period late
I’m like fuck it shit I need a baby anyway
My young nigga let that semi spray on anyday
Fuck that killer I don’t want that money anyway
Niggas gas a solid
So i'm in any state
Pussy with  my molly on my dinner plate
I’m a do the whole dolly on the inner state
Heard I fucked your hoe in private
Prolly by mistake Prolly by mistake wait
I didn't want that pussy anyways
Nigga I ain't want that pussy anyways

[Hook]
My nigga say police is going to lock Issa up
Good nigga he just couldn't get that reefer up
I told Michala baby pray for me don’t wait for me
With all this money I’m making you can take a piece
I got niggas out the right cause I’m a stay green
My nigga just save side thats the same team
And I can’t sell my lean cause bitch I take lean
Driving while I’m sleeping in my day dream
