[Intro]
She fell in love with a dope boy
Until she found out
Dope boys, bitch ass niggas
Scared of the killas
Scared of the riders!

[Hook]
She fell in love with a murderer
I'm a cold blooded killer
So you should know what I did to that pussy, boy
You damn right I hit her
She heard I was a dope boy
I heard she was a gold digger
All I know is she a real bitch
So I fuck her like a real nigga

[Verse 1]
Met her in Miami, I was fuckin' up a check
All black with a strap, I was fuckin' up they set
Fat nigga in the drop so the roof dropped back
Pocket full of guap, tell yo' ex nigga top that
Have you ever had sex in a cherry red Bach?
With a fat trap, nigga get that pussy so wet
Work it out, Bowflex, OG, no stress
Proceed, progress, new house, mo' checks
I know you tired of ya lifestyle
She said she love me cause my life wild
She said she need it right now
Cause what I got can't fit in a Lifestyle
Actavis make her tongue sweet
And going deep make her heart stop
All it take is one call
I'm pullin' up when the call drop

[Hook]

[Bridge: Fat Trel]
Fuck her like a real nigga
I fuck her like a real nigga
I fuck her like a real nigga
She fuckin' with a real nigga

[Verse 2]
I met her in Orlando, after the show
I was tryna leave, she told me she tryna go
I was on the pill, she told me she tryna roll
I was tryna fuck so she told me do it slow
Hit her from the back, sippin' Act, blowin' pap
Whenever she leave, tell her lead with the strap
My chopper's in the front, triple beams in the back
Young bitch, gotta teach her how to act, how to trap like
Take that, leave that though, three stacks for the petro
Window down for the jet smoke, I remember riding Metro
Now it's beef steak with the beer shrimp
Heavy butter like a real pimp
She gettin' tired, counting all night
Shopping trips make it alright

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro: Fat Trel]
I fuck her like a real nigga
Fuck her like a real nigga
