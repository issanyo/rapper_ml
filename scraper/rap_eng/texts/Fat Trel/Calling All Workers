[Verse 1]
Slutty boy game WMG
I say everytime I open my eyes it’s a
Nigga talking about what a normal nigga ain’t got
Till you get the led and you put it in his head
And now he red and laying dead on another nigga block
I  don’t give a fuck about a cop I turn kettle to a pop
Turn metal to a rock bought more bitch like Betty with a rock
I don’t know how she walk steady with the pot
Cool as a fan take it to the jewels and the cash
About to make  the move with your man
Whips it low tell me it’s a hot price is low
I can tell when a can I don’t understand
How you get worth with your words
Get murked in a purse thrown in the dirt
Get a pussy nigga his worth
Stripping in a halfpipe skirt

[Hook]
I’m calling all working two for 80 (Two for 80)
With her babies  (With her babies)
The going crazy (They going crazy)
I’m calling all workers
All workers
Two for 80 (Two for 80)
With her babies (With her babies)
The going crazy (They going crazy)
I’m calling all workers

[Verse 2]
Why you want to have a conversation with a nigga
About working you never worked none stop
Stop front I heard your whole block not punked
No pump no rocks no thots no humps
I just woke the whole house up then I
Get a red bitch fucked the whole coach up
Then I don’t even think I had me enough
I just like to see her throw the back in the trunk
You say do say I say no way BLACY no way
Dick on the lip that's colgate no way
Riding with a mother fucking coke case
Trying to make a bad bitch blow guy
She me next time she got no life
Rolex watch nigga two yachts
Still fucking around your blocks

[Hook]
