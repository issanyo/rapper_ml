[Chorus]
I pull the Jag up, I fuck a bag up
I never brag much, 'cause I never had nothin'
I was a bad child, mama say I'm bad luck
I was Felipe child, remember them bag lunches
Remember them cold nights, whippin' the snow white
Was living the slow life, I'm really a low life
Remember them cold nights, whippin' the snow white
Was living the slow life, I'm really a low life

[Verse 1]
I'm really a bastard, was whippin' the Casper
My shooter disaster, put you in a casket
I'm whippin' the Jaguar, that bitch like a Nascar
I'm with a little bad broad, she into them fast cars
This shit in my bloodline, I'm only on plug time
I'm talking that bag talk, I come from the asphalt
I come from the dirt with it, I'm purchasing work with it
And you can get murked with it, put you on a shirt with it
Hope you don't confuse us, we really the shooters
Ain't into the internet, don't do the computers
We really be poppin' out, bringing them choppers out
Let's see what this guap about, police just keep hopping out

[Chorus]
I pull the Jag up, I fuck a bag up
I never brag much, 'cause I never had nothin'
I was a bad child, mama say I'm bad luck
I was Felipe child, remember them bag lunches
Remember them cold nights, whippin' the snow white
Was living the slow life, I'm really a low life
Remember them cold nights, whippin' the snow white
Was living the slow life, I'm really a low life

[Verse 2]
Really I'm crazy, I'm whippin' a baby
They standing in line for it, shit look like the 80's
I was born in the 90's, my brothers is grimy
Northeast in the alleys, that's where you can find me
I cop it, I get it, then whip it, then flip it, then buy me a timepiece
She seein' my business, I'm fuckin' her sister, that pussy was Siamese
I cook like an Asian, I call her persuasion
My new bitch Jamaican, that pussy was flamin'
A hundred my draco, ain't doing no aimin'
Coming up short on the pesos, don't do no complainin'
We just gon' pull up and shoot shit
You little niggas ain't gon' do shit
Walk on your block with the broomstick
MAC-90 like a pool stick

[Chorus]
I pull the Jag up, I fuck a bag up
I never brag much, 'cause I never had nothin'
I was a bad child, mama say I'm bad luck
I was Felipe child, remember them bag lunches
Remember them cold nights, whippin' the snow white
Was living the slow life, I'm really a low life
Remember them cold nights, whippin' the snow white
Was living the slow life, I'm really a low life, really a
