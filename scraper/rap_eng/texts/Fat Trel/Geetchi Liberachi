[Intro: Rick Ross]
I stepped out the Panamera with my DGK Classics on that bitch ya heard me?
Patek Philippe ya heard me?
It's that g shit, ya heard me?
Ya heard me?

[Adlib: Fat Trel]
Bitch

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Pull up in my Rover, watching Jerry Springer
Geetchi Liberachi, ring on every finger
All I love is women, all my women love me
Geetchi Liberachi stuff your pussy full of money
Order 20 bottles, do this for my niggas
Geetchi Liberachi, my bitches see physicians

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
Gleeshi living Geetchi, Belaire, Circoc is peachy
Bitches kissing hugging sucking fuck me when they see me
In Miami eating chicken steak and shrimp linguine
Fat boy do it the best, need two bitches to feed me
Ring n wrist a Rollie, make this shit look easy
??? police just can't believe it
Counting paper til I'm sleeping with my evil people
No heaven for a killer smoking dope with Beanie Sigel
Drug dealer double life & I'mma see the sequel
Kill you when I see you, we was never equal
On another level working on another bezel
I'm a 100 shotta you a 38 special

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Pull up in my Rover, watching Jerry Springer
Geetchi Liberachi, ring on every finger
All I love is women, all my women love me
Geetchi Liberachi stuff your pussy full of money
Order 20 bottles, do this for my niggas
Geetchi Liberachi, my bitches see physicians

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Order 20 models, I pay for all my pussy
Can't buy no more cars, ain't no place to put em
Geetchi Liberachi, ring on every finger
Did it like I'm Ike bitch sing it like you tina
Catch me up in Lenox, might blow a twinke
Smoking in a benzo, my bitch resemble Pinky
Geetchi Liberachi, my Cuban weigh a kilo
One call from papi, bitch I think I'm Nino

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Pull up in my Rover, watching Jerry Springer
Geetchi Liberachi, ring on every finger
All I love is women, all my women love me
Geetchi Liberachi stuff your pussy full of money
Order 20 bottles, do this for my niggas
Geetchi Liberachi, my bitches see physicians
