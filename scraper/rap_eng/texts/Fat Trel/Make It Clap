[Hook] (x2)
Please, make that ass clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
I got bands, I got racks
Racks, racks, racks, racks

[Verse 1]
Look, I am from the city so my favorite strip is Stadium
You gon' pro'ly need a couple K to come and play with them
Might see me with John Wall, ball, no gymnasium
I'm in VIP so much, the strippers think I stay with them
I'm talking Calient√©, Bambi and Passion
Ms. French Kiss, Ms. Jones in Miami
Phat-Phat Rabbit, Farrah in Dallas
Charlie, Dollface, Jasmine and Carmen
Pussy poppin', bottle poppin', floor full of dollars
Only mean it's coming soon, locker room drama
Half-white, half-black, ass-flying mama
I think I'm in love with her cause she tote the llama, so

[Verse 2]
Pussy poppin', bottle poppin', molly poppin' dank
Niggas hating, bitches watching, I become the man
Guns in the stash but my ones in her hand
Then I said "make it clap" and she forgot she had a man
Damn, I got some strippers who be snorting lines
With a nine on they side, them bitches don't mind firing
I done fucked a couple of 'em, dipping like "where time went?"
She don't wanna fuck, she just tryna get her mind hit
Savage, reaching in my pocket, you could have it
She say "you a slutty boy", them bitches say we nasty
But I got what she need, so she call me Fat Gleesh
And we leaving the stadium where she don't fuck for free, huh
