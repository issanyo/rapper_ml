[Verse 1:]
Fuck Police I smoke like I ride and I ride like A G
And if I'm in the Chi I'ma ride to the D with a 9 on my side, on my side is a piece
I be young black nigga love to roll the pack in the trap fat nigga
Pull up with the mac war to my back, roll another fat
Matter fact better shoot back nigga
Wait, he only eat it for steak on the plate
Slumpy with chicken this niggas is straight
You thought I was new but the truth is you late
You look a snake and your jewelry is fake
I basically say I don't fuck with you niggas
Trust me its nothing to bust at you niggas
Niggas is snitching and bitches is watching I rather just choose not to pop at ya top
See all of the bitches I fuck and the money
I got em and I'm thinking like why should i stop
Check in the bag this shit getting sad
I'm running through bitches I knew I would have
Thinking of scooping a coupe or a jag
Scoop up the crew, do what we do
Go tell my ho pour a four in a two
Say somebody was broke and I know it was you
That ain't really what the real players do
Fuck a ho right for a day or two
Take the pussy from the hood, If the pussy real good then you know a real nigga gotta share you
Now that's player fool
Ride around my city like the mayor fool
Keep this shit 100, if I see it I'ma want it
Got a hundred round choppa, you ain't taking nothing from me
All I know is I'ma keep it 300
Quick feet if a nigga sweet we comin'
6 feet let em leak laying on his stomach, you don't really want it
Laying down run it
Need money, everything money
Pull up on the scene ain't a damn thing funny
Think shit a dream how you ain't never seen money
Got the white with clean dirty magazine money
Get money, fuck hoes
I'll peel a P-7 truck slow
Take a seven out the P puff dro
I ain't greedy take 3 fuck 4
Let's go pop a molly roll
How the fuck he say he ballin', his Ferragamo stollen
Right wrist bright bitch rolex, rollie
Wifey come from Cali but she don't know Kobe
I'm lonely sitting at the top
Big face watch in a big boy drop
Got one shot, you shoot I pop whether or not I'd advise you to stop
I be wild as a fool walking through the crowd blowing loud with the crew
Rolling with a down, hear the sound of the tool
Never come around cause my shooter he a fool

[Outro:]
It's me, it's you, get money what the fuck we do
Let the choppa hit him up datz kool
Let the coppers do what they do
Cause my Glock is matching my shoes
My swagger matching my boo
I done ran thru half of her crew
Let me stop the track datz kool
Get money what the fuck we do
Let the choppa hit em up datz kool
Get money what the fuck we do
Let the choppa hit him up datz kool
Cause my Glock is matching my shoes
My swagger matching my boo
I done ran thru half of her crew
Let me stop the track datz kool
Get money what the fuck we do
Let the choppa hit him up datz kool
Get money what the fuck we do
Let the choppa hit him up datz kool
