[Verse 2]
Ima keep my gun ain't playing up in these streets
We ain't squashing no war it's gonna be what it's go be
Slide up on a op and knock him off his feet
Come through with a chopper and put a nigga 6ft deep
Walked up his block put holes up in his jeep
Called a nigga like we was riding full Glock full deep
I was riding with some hitters King James, Fat Trel and me
You niggas don't really wanna die up in these streets
We ain't squashing beef with no nigga
We ain't respecting none a you old niggas
Hard body we ain't squashing no war
I be going kuku like Jay Walsh
