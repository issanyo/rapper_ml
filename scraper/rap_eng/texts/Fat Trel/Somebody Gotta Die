[Hook]
Die (die)
Some body going to die (die homicidal or suicidal)
Somebody gotta die when I die I hope you niggas cry
When your niggas die my niggas going to ride
Somebody gotta die (somebody gotta die)
Somebody gotta die (somebody gotta die)
They killed my dog last night (they killed my dog last night)
And we want to know why

[Verse 1]
So now somebody gotta die
Somebody gotta die
Fuck niggas gotta die
They killed my dog last night
My partner asked me was I down to ride
So now somebody gotta die
Fuck niggas gotta die
Am Call them for a homicide
Them crazy 90’s baby told me five
Tell your baby mother don’t come my side
My niggas wild they so idalized
So we roll like a roll tire
You can see the killers in my eye
So when you see me drop by don’t act surprised
In my business I realise
That with disrespect I shoot you 30 times
You disappear your peers will never find
If you survive then I’m right behind
I bet I find somebody and they gotta die

[Hook]
Somebody gotta die (Somebody gotta die )
Fuck niggas gotta die
They killed my dog last night (they killed my dog last night)
And we want to know why
So now somebody gotta die
Somebody gotta die
Fuck niggas gotta die
They killed my dog last night
My partner asked me was I down to ride
So now somebody gotta die
Fuck niggas gotta die

[Verse 2]
He might commit a suicide
Them crazy 90’s babies told them 5
Tell your baby brother don’t come our side
Bitches told me my whole gang crazy
But my fans pay me for gangways
Well these are my hay day
Dreadlocks never rocked fade
Killers like activist and lemonade
I know your hands like we playing spade
I’m only rolling with the rent days
Because with killing we got plenty ways
Got plenty K’s

[Hook]
Somebody gotta die (Somebody gotta die )
Fuck niggas gotta die
They killed my dog last night (they killed my dog last night)
And we want to know why
So now somebody gotta die
Somebody gotta die
Fuck niggas gotta die
They killed my dog last night
My partner asked me was I down to ride
So now somebody gotta die
