Dree the drummer
Damn all that gang shit
Yeah, we're on that gang shit
Ha, you heard
This shit get real

[Pre-Hook]
Say you wanna work one, flirt one
Put it up a skirt one
Put em in the dirt one
Hit it where it hurt
Young nigga wish you work
This shit get real

[Hook]
Say she wanna fuck in the back of the truck
While I roll me a blunt with the window rolled up
With my finger in her butt and a cup
Finna pop me a pill

[Chorus]
Lets do it trill
I met a slut, I touched her butt, I copped a feel (I copped a feel)
My bitch be worried cause I’m always in the field (I’m in the field)
I'm never worried cause I always got the steal (I got the steal)

I don’t give a fuck, he don’t give a fuck
She don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
Bitch walked up like roll up
Turn around tell that bitch hold up

Bumpin that 56 nights
On the molly up 56 nights
Airpot five-fiftysix flights
And nigga had to fuck 56 dikes

Drop a bell on the scale, that work (that work)
Damn well you could tell I'm perfect (I'm perfect)
Nigga sell no chick then church it
Gotta pack like nigga got verses

Got lean like a nigga got water
Got a migo bitch from the border
Got a team and I got Jordan's
Damn I would’ve fucked your daughter (mawh)

[x2]
Nigga I don’t give a fuck, nigga whats up
Nigga die right now, nigga good luck
I’m the only nigga, hold up hood up
We could fuck right now, bitch what's up

[Pre-Hook]
Say you wanna work one, flirt one
Put it up a skirt one
Put em in the dirt one
Hit it where it hurt
Young nigga wish you work
This shit get real

[Hook]
Say she wanna fuck in the back of the truck
While I roll me a blunt with the window rolled up
With my finger in her butt and a cup
Finna pop me a pill

[Chorus]
Lets do it trill
I met a slut, I touched her butt, I copped a feel (I copped a feel)
My bitch be worried cause I’m always in the field (I’m in the field)
I'm never worried cause I always got the steal (I got the steal)

[Boosa]
Pulled up nigga no slowed up
Nigga paid mine, get burnt up
Higher than the bitch, no low fare
Even though I got shit real, no joking
I dont fuck with niggas, if a nigga ain't real
Bitch pulling up finna cop me a feel
I ain't with the talk, when I got that steal
Posting on my block, I get it how I live
Got 60 bank cuz I got two kids
I ain't gunna stop till I set a couple mil
Couple real niggas, bad bitches in the feel
Fuck the police cuz I only shoot to kill
Even in jail, come up with a pill
Fuck the police cuz I only shoot to kill
Even in jail, come up with a pill
Let niggas know this shit for real

This shit for real
For all my niggas in the feel (We in the feel)
We pop a pill
We cop a feel, fuck your bitch
Thats how I feel
