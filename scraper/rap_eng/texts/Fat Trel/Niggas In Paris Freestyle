Ball so hard think I broke my wrist

[Verse 1]
I don't ball hog, I ball dawg
Keep a bitch in my dirty drawers
Sneaker flick with my Easter chick
She a egghead, we drink eggnog
I'm the best, like fuck the rest
Can I fall off? Hell nah
V-A Beach with Pusha-T, he vouched he tried to tell y'all
Ciroc with my E pill, red lean in my Mountain Dew
That don't mean I'm leaning wrong
It just mean I lean unlike you
Hotel with my fool squad
Model broads and some dykes too
And they on my dick like
"Trel the Freak, and he eat the pussy with ice too"
Damn right, that's what I like
Shop the mall, gotta fuck tonight
Ring the wrist, get real bright
My shit shine like field lights
So high I kill kites
Do what the fuck I feel like
Fuck your clique and fuck your bitch
And fuck your bitch, I still might
Ball hard, Jersey drench
Nigga like me never seen the bench
2 plus 3, I count the cent
Cus I need that, like I'm paying rent
Other words, we killing birds
White bitch, and she love to serve
Walk slow, my words slurred
Take a flight like Jew Erv
Free Mike Mike, something slight
That's cause, fuck what you heard
Bodymore, Murderland
Killing cops: that's absurd
Right now I'm drinking rock with real niggas from Palmer Park
No punchout, your clock stop
Got big guap with a big Glock
Bracelet you can't take it baby
Northeast don't do wrist watch
Last fool tried to pop slick
The bitch and him got shot
And I rep the top spot
Stripper bitch with that hot twat
Trash bags with greenbacks
My trunk heavy need fixer flat
