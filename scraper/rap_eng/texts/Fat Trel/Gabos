[Intro]
These bitches think I like to think about them
When I was only talking money showers
I seen my cousin count a hundred dollars
Just when you think that pussy different them the same flowers....

[Trapaholics intro]
DC what the fuck it do man
I love ya'll north east forever you heard me
DMV take you nigga back to when I was 17 nigga
You niggas need port of miami in your life
You broke ass niggas man

[Verse 1]
These bitches think I like to think about them
When I was only talking money showers
I seen my cousin count a hundred dollars
Just when you think that pussy different them the same flowers
Throught the thunder and the rain I remain power
Instead them killas thinking about them from the same towers
It’s funny how they cowards with no allowance
I finesse the slave house I call it coke flowers
Now tell me tell me who you thought it was
Because every nigga with me do the same drugs
Same bitches but we never have the same love
Same riches but them niggas ain’t the same thugs

[hook]
Fuck you niggas talking about
Ambulance coroner's talk them out
Another nigga dead on the news spread
Couple days later whole crew dead
Against all odds nigga and the game
Ain’t based on sympathy at all
Against all odds nigga cause we were born to die
Against all odds nigga and the game
Ain’t based on sympathy at all
Against all odds nigga cause we were born to die

[Verse 2]
So look, my haters think I like to talk about them
I’m George Townin' I’m just trying finesse a mink up out em
I’m still wilding responsible for those thots pocket
Can’t tell me different bitch I know all about it
Niggas trickin spending chicken sniff the flowers
I book them flights I let them count them
They really bought it I don’t care
Because everybody gotta die there no way around it
I’m finally rich I’m finally rolling I finally found it
I highly doubt that you ever out and she knew without her
I switched from kitchen to positions of power
New York in the trenches where there shipments are sour
My shit like nutrition two shits in an hour bang

[hook/outro]
Fuck you niggas talking about
Ambulance coroner's talk them out
Another nigga dead on the news spread
Couple days later whole crew dead
Against all odds nigga and the game
Ain’t based on sympathy at all
Against all odds nigga cause we were born to die
Against all odds nigga and the game
Ain’t based on sympathy at all
Against all odds nigga cause we were born to die
