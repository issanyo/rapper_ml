[Hook: Young Moe & Fat Trel]
They know I'm a souljah (They know I'm for real)
I grew up on that corner (Grew up without a meal)
They hate it when you show love (Waiting for the deal)
So I just keep em closer (I'm right here)
They know I'm a souljah (They know I'm for real)
I grew up on that corner (Grew up without a meal)
They hate it when you show love (Waiting for the deal)
So I just keep em closer (I'm right here)
That's why I 40 on my waist
New lawyer to fight my cases
Them handcuffs for my bracelets
Young nigga might make it
Some of y'all niggas won't make it
Blow, young nigga might take it
My young niggas say thank you, they ain't got no patience

[Verse 1:  Fat Trel]
In the trap with the yay, all night all day
Young nigga like to spray AKs
New new whip on a new new day, got top on my new boo face
We was never worried bout race
Pop a lot of pills, Imma stack new face
Traffic race, my iPhone crazy
Hit another lick, and Imma make another baby
Back in '05 it was gravy, Old head nigga like to look like Lazy(?)
I just get the book right, dealing with the crook type
Show up in the hood type, good night lady, baby
Am I gonna fuck you? Maybe
Imma make her wait cause I think she tryna play me
305, fucking with the Haitians
Got a lotta money like I hustle in the H, baby
Act right, double cup laced
Double dutch, 2 sluts, wait
Pour it up, roll it up, face it
Young nigga might make it
Act right, double cup laced
Double dutch, 2 sluts, wait
Pour it up, roll it up, face it
Young nigga might make it

[Verse 2: Young Moe]
In the gutter where the niggas don't make it
And they taught us how to steal and don't say shit
Known some niggas that'll kill to be famous
It ain't happen, they be rapping for the playlist
I'm a dog, no K-9
Spray mine on the niggas that be crossing like aye-ya
If a nigga try to take mine, Imma blow him out the frame, out the game to the baseline
Running with some niggas who be living cuz they shooting like a free-throw
No goals they gonna hit you through the peephole
Niggas break codes cuz he singing like Neyo
Ya, got some niggas that'll do it for the low fee
13, and he driller so he tow heat
From Virginia, but the killers outta North-East
They be hitting so they grilling on the police
No bullshit, got the full clip, put the 50 round drum in that AR
They be hating, motivating me to play hard
I been patient and I'm scraping till it pays off
Came a long way from them hallway days to the sold out shows
Mug one of my bros Imma pick up my phone
I ain't really gotta talk about smoke cuz...
