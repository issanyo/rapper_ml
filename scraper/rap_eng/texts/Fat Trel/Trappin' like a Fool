[Intro:]
Trappin like a fool, me and that fat fool
Kept that fuckin tool, didnâ€™t go to school
Shawty lookin at me
Dope boy, got some blow? Got some rock?
Get the fuck out my face!
And keep them god damn babies out the street
I think he don't like me and the way my clique thuggin
I really don't give a shit
Bout to bust it out the wrapper, sell it to a trapper
I really don't give a shit
I was trappin like a bitch

[Verse 1:]
Well I come from the way where the bitches be hoes, and the mom ain't home and the daddy went away
Brother locked up, little brother bought a K
Baby girl show her ass crack 'round the way
All about the money, make it look like nothing
Had the bitches mouth runnin, "He ain't stuntin anyway"
Meanwhile, I was in the back where I lay, me and Slutty P blowin loud all day
In my own damn lane, fuck yo chain
Bitches that will murder for the love of cocaine
Let her poke her ass out, then you touch that thang
Like, "What's yo name?" Bust yo brain
Leave a nigga dead, that's a god damn shame
You can ask Deuce how the fuck niggas do
Southside niggas love to roll like Juice
Deuce Deuce in the 380 and the Nike boots
Trappin like a bitch, till ya man start talkin
Then your man start hatin, now he actin like a bitch
Nigga disrespectin, then ya man don't check 'em
Then we reachin for the weapons, and they clappin like a bitch
Stackin in a drought, nigga we in DC
No work in the city, then we goin down south
You see your bitch gone ride with me
GPS don't know no routes
When they let them go-go's out
You should leave immediately and pretend every light you see is green
If you see the heat then it's kiss ya sweet dreams
Riding in the box, probably got 2 Glocks
With ya bitch on my jock, and I spark big green
With my seat way back, and my neck on gleam
If my wrist go pop, I'mma spark that thing

[Hook:]
Bust it out the wrapper, sell it to a trapper
I really don't give a shit
I was trappin like a bitch
I was trappin like a bitch
I tote a lot of bricks
I hit a lot of licks
I really don't give a shit

[Verse 2:]
First the sun rolls up, then the gun rolls up
Then the choppas split 'em open, cut 'em like a cold cut
Then the moon went down, then the sun came up
Ain't no body pick 'em up, so police showed up
Knockin on the door, nigga we don't know shit
As-Salamu Alaykum, we don't fuck with that pig
Scooby got killed, we ain't heard shit since
Please go where ever, but get the fuck from 'round here
Ecstasy and liquor we don't go around beer
Old cups and roll-ups got me slowed up
Bitch named Candi will suck ya hole up
And you don't know a hood bitch if you don't know her
Northeast shit, what the fuck niggas mean
All about the stuntin, and I'm killin every scene
Bitches wanna fuck cause he eyes all green
And his sling be the best, and his walk all mean
Talk all crazy, spark all hazey
Fool wanna trip, said he rappin but paid me
Jack my bitch, we gon' run in his shit
Nigga you can get a dick, that's a 30-round clip
Fuck with Larry Johnson, but we don't play games
No secrets, nigga we don't say names
I'm like HOV, listenin to HOV
In the H-O-V, nigga we don't switch lanes
Black Cobain, is that yo dame?
Ain't tryna trick, but I know I got change
I could fuck her with my daddy, I could fuck her in the caddy
I could make her pull it over and I could fuck her in the rain
All I'm tryna say is what the fuck you niggas sayin?
Got my money with me, why the fuck you niggas playin?
Rollin off the bland, coolin with my man
No days off, that's the mother fuckin plan

[Hook:]
Bust it out the wrapper, sell it to a trapper
I really don't give a shit
I was trappin like a bitch
I was trappin like a bitch
I tote a lot of bricks
I hit a lot of licks
I really don't give a shit
