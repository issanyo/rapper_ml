They say what don't kill you just make you stronger
They say what don't kill you just make you stronger
All that motherfucking hate made me get out gang
Get my hustle on
Go to louie store baby get whatever you want
It ain't no limit, we on now

[Hook: x2]
Last year, shit, we barely eat
This year, we fucking on them Louie sheets
Broke niggas, get no moneky
I'm in the zoo act, a fucking donkey

Hate niggas, see how the table turn
No limit, did it once, bitch we got another turn
Call me derrek dunkings, bout to break it back boy
Nigga going hella fast, 160 on the dashboard
And your bitch drop it for me nigga like a pro
Do shit for me nigga you will never know
We doing shit niggas ain't never see
Let the record play I'm back nigga, Al Green
God bitches popping for them green beans
Standing over niggas like I'm ya'll maine
A nigga winning like Charlie Sheen
Fuck her good, she will cook a nigga collie green

[Hook: x2]
Last year, shit, we barely eat
This year, we fucking on them Louie sheets
Broke niggas, get no moneky
I'm in the zoo act, a fucking donkey

No hesitation graduate, elevate my education
Call my chopper, special K
Extra pussy just to play
Fucking on my louie shit, Gucci loubbie on her feet
Shopping spree she out with me
Pop that pussy properly, no stopping me
Oh my God, think her boyfriend watching me
Call it hard for stalking me
Come and shop and drop a block with me
All about my mozzarella, bacon cheese and broccoli
Vicky short, tattered up, fucked her on the louie sheets
Girlfriend, super thick, titties ass real big
Nails done, hair did, fucked her on the louie sheets
All we know is ball, I got money I'm a throw
Feel it like I can do it all, I feel like I can't fall

[Hook: x2]
Last year, shit, we barely eat
This year, we fucking on them Louie sheets
Broke niggas, get no moneky
I'm in the zoo act, a fucking donkey

Head first ain't no backing in
Gun black as an African
Don't talk crazy on my line
Them people might be tapping in
Especially when this rap is kinda like when I was trapping
Bought my pack in sack then wrapped it
Got a skirt and send it packing, booya!
How far away them days seem
This river floating winning brought me to the main stream
So I get on my boat, then float in hopes that I stay seen
Sing, whatever, as long as I'm paid, is better
Than anything I know, any, anything I know
Bitches see me they see green so everything's a go
Smoke weed with my mama nigga
Honest nigga, everyday I profit nigga, fat trel, p and problem nigga

[Hook: x2]
Last year, shit, we barely eat
This year, we fucking on them Louie sheets
Broke niggas, get no moneky
I'm in the zoo act, a fucking donkey
