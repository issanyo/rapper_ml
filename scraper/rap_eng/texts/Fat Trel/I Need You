[Hook: Fetty Wap]
I'm spending all of my time with you, baby
Got me going out of my mind I need you all the time
And I swear I ain't lying to you, baby
Just tell me what I can prove
Just to show you it's true, baby
I see you, baby
Would you believe me, baby?
When I say I need you, baby
Trust me you'll need me as much as I need you

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
You find me, I'm trappin' out the [?]
Can't fuck with them niggas, they got on camouflage
I'm feelin' like David sent me insane asylum
As long as I got me chopper forever sawed
Supposed to be with me, you see me catch a case
And robbin' old ladies for less than a check of paper
Remember we kissed and fucked on the elevators
We gettin' real high like skyscrapers
Epitome of trap like I'm Darth Vader
I keep them product pushin' like the escalator
I makin' all the rules like legislator
You creepin' through my trash like a investigator

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
You find me, I'm kissin' women I'm fynna crave
She tell me she love me, I hit it plenty ways
She fussin', I'm chillin', I'm sippin' lemonade
I'm breakin' all the rules, I'm a renegade
She says she never leave from a green maker
She say her ex-man never seen paper
She say don't go to sleep cause I can dream later
But I just popped a pill sippin' lean later
Soon as the bell drop I'm a male thot
I'm at the strip club like this bell hop
She got a well on her, I'mma tell on her
I might just posses her and put a spell on her

[Hook]
