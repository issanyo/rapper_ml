[Intro]
JD On Tha Track
Yeah-ha

[Chorus]
Went to load up on straps
But I think I wanna buy some more (More)
Nigga don't be comin' back
Unless you're strapped for war (War)
I have a million dollar dream
Spread your wings and soar (Soar)
I remember them days
We ain't had no place, we poor (Poor)
I just need more racks, I just put 'em on a flight
Niggas need more packs now (Now)
I remember I was broke, she ain't wanna call back
But she be on my jock now (My jock now)
Now I'm runnin' through her sack, I'ma put her on the track
You can blow out her back now (Now)
To recover that ac' had to spend a few racks
I don't know how to act now (Now)

[Verse 1]
But she all on my back, I don't really wan' snap
I just wanna fall back now (Fall back now)
I just wanna do the shows, I just wanna fuck hoes
I don't really wanna trap now (Wanna trap now)
Nigga pockets on swoll, got a big bankroll
Yeah, nigga, I'm back now (I'm back now)
And I ain't never been a ho, nigga, say it one more
Niggas know I don't back down (Don't back down)
Waited all day long just to pick up my phone
Nigga hold them packs down (Packs down)
Won't snitch, won't fold, nigga still on parole
You can check my background (Check my background)
Do the highway speed, nigga got what you need
I'ma put a little tax down (Tax down)
Gotta trick up my sleeve, gotta pick up my speed
I'ma need a little Thrax now (Need a little Thrax now)
I'm so impatient, I got a crazy ho
Which way to go? (Which way to go?)
I bought her Lexus, I bought her diamonds
I'm tryna blind the ho (Blind the ho)
Remember them times when I was so broke
I couldn't even find a ho (Couldn't even find a ho)
Ain't wasted no time puttin' my juice on the line
I had to remind the ho (I had to remind the ho)

[Chorus]
Went to load up on straps
But I think I wanna buy some more (More)
Nigga don't be comin' back
Unless you're strapped for war (War)
I have a million dollar dream
Spread your wings and soar (Soar)
I remember them days
We ain't had no place, we poor (poor)
I just need more racks, I just put 'em on a flight
Niggas need more packs now (Now)
I remember I was broke, she ain't wanna call back
But she be on my jock now (Now)
Now I'm runnin' through her sack, I'ma put her on the track
You can blow out her back now (Now)
To recover that ac' had to spend a few racks
I don't know how to act now (Now)

[Verse 2]
I don't need no leeches, I bought a new whip
And I blew out the speakers (Speakers)
Like a whole new season, I'ma come to your city
I'ma need a few features (Need a few features)
Like I really don't need it, I look upon a star
And I really wan' reach it (Really wan' reach it)
Like I'm goin' out of town just to go and put it down
I don't really need a reason (I don't need a real reason)
I don't wanna waste no time
'Cause I been really out of my mind, yeah (Mind, yeah)
Seek and you shall find
But I been lookin' for a gold mine, yeah (Mine, yeah)
Got a young bitch, so fine
But every time I leave, she cryin', yeah (Cryin', yeah)
I'ma put it all on the line
I'ma go extendin' my nine, yeah
I'ma go put it on the ice for fee
Shine in the dark like the light's on me (Ice)
Got a good heart, keep the price on fleek (Fleek)
Grind all day, nigga, don't like sleep (Sleep)
I don't like you, nigga, you don't like me (Wha?)
Fifty shot Glock 'cause you know I like beef (Bow)
Drop my top, she can squirt on my seat (Mwa)
Shot up my block, Just know I'm like E
Just know I'm like E, yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Went to load up on straps
But I think I wanna buy some more (More)
Nigga don't be comin' back
Unless you're strapped for war (War)
I have a million dollar dream
Spread your wings and soar (Soar)
I remember them days
We ain't had no place, we poor (poor)
I just need more racks, I just put 'em on a flight
Niggas need more packs now (Now)
I remember I was broke, she ain't wanna call back
But she be on my jock now (Now)
Now I'm runnin' through her sack, I'ma put her on the track
You can blow out her back now (Now)
To recover that ac' had to blow a few racks
I don't know how to act now (Now)
