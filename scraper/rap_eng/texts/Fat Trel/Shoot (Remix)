[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Man, fuck that nigga, fuck them niggas
Fuck all you niggas, go to war
Say, "Goodbye you pussy boys!"
They know the mob, ain't no family
Ain't no amends, just my grenade
Say, "Hello, to my little friend!"
Now, watch your back, watch your front
Feds watching us, we rock the coast
It's a dirty game, "Gleesh cut his throat!"
On the block they calling me the fireman
Murder game, bitch a gangland
Where I'm from that hit 3 grand
Broad day, nigga, motherfuck a plan
Second shooter, just in case my gun jam
Body count, bitch, Gleesh the Son of Sam

[Hook]
