[Intro]
Sluttyboy shit nigga northeast, you know how we rock

[Verse]
I got killas in the district, whip the chickens in the kitchen
Tell the truth and never kiddin', we do this shit for a livin'
I was dreamin' I was winning, then I woke up and I did it
(lets getutt) And that was one hell of a feelin' (so what?)
So my new Mercedes is tinted
I got broads in Atlanta, strippin' in literal vannah
Sucking and fuckin' on camera
I fucked that little pussy with stamina
Credit cards in the scanners, a pot of hard go bananas
Own my job like a janitor, come out with my name
It's 'Pamela'
Pamela raised the hustler
Stacked the package in the muffler
Never wrestle, I'm a tussler
Reach the weapon then I'm bussin' you
Spanish bitch I'm finger fucking her
I'm trynna see what was up with you
I fuck her, you trust her, you love her
I can never be a sucker
I swear to god I'm a bamma, I shoot at your motha for nothin'
Going hard doing damage, pretty broads couldn't manage
Hundred thou' now we at it, Louis luggage Ima grab it
All my youngins causing havoc, motherfucka I'm a savage
