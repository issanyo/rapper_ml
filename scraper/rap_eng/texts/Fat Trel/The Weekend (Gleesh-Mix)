[Intro: Fat Trel]
Yeah, so
Gotta cool it baby, you just gotta be cool, you know?
We don't live like that, hahahahaha, you know?
I can understand why you don't understand what the fuck goin' on
Haha, look

[Verse: Fat Trel]
I'm away from the wive like two nights, three nights
I ain't even fuckin' with the street life
Wifey said I fucked up twice, next time
Ain't no next time, well I guess I got two strikes
You like, who like, baby true life
You right, you just with the work and go to school life
You ain't never count a hundred K at one time
Baby I can introduce you to a new life
My side bitch say we don't never go out
Roll out, nigga you just tryna hold out
I'm just tryna keep you out the eye of the public
You know the paparazzi on fuck shit
I know I told you I was finna choose up
New truck, we thought it was love, it was true lust
True enough, I been on the bus with some true sluts
Who ain't scared to turn up, let the whole crew fuck
But I'm goin' back home on a Monday
Had to do a hundred on the one way
My side bitch said she finna pull up
Well good luck, wifey go dumb with the gunplay
I know I was wrong but it feel right
I say I'm finna stop but I still might
I got all these bitches in love
When you fuckin' with a thug, baby this is what it feel like
You livin' what I'm spittin' baby, real life
Lay it down hard, real hard like a steel pipe
And I swear to God she a different type of broad
Like to do it on the porch, let me hit it on the yard
She say fuck the rest, I'm the best by far
Pussy so good I'll catch a new charge
Sex so good I'll buy that bitch a car
Skip the studio and I'll probably skip it tomorrow like
Like, like

[Chorus: SZA]
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend
