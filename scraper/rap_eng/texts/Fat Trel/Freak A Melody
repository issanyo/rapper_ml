[Verse 1]
Okay
I had to take the stairs, I usually use the elevator
Every now and then I eat that nooky like a now & later
She say she my educator, I'll be her terminator
In it long,in it strong, now go congratulate her
Long doe you gon' count it
You gon' need some calculators
Rocking Mauri alligators, now ask me where i'mma take her
Now i'mma take her far, like this beat right here on mars
Now i'mma let see the star if she really get in the car like

[Hook 1]
Hannah takes the stairs and I usually use take the elevator
Every now and then she offers me a lemon now & later
Please don't play the matchmaker, please don't be a player hater
If you dig her recent work then you should go congratulate her

Uh, But look
Mommy let her cheese grow, head, nails, feet show
Smokin tree and drinkin' O will turn into a freak show
She say can her friend go? Only if my fool go
Know you see the snow piled high boo school closed

[Hook 2]
Hannah let your roots grow let your blue veins show
If I need to take a breath then you can take a trumpet solo
I'll work on the limbs if you work on the torso and
If it gets to be too much then you can lend a helping hand

( Bounce bounce bounce - Wale - )
She gon' let my fool go, he gon' let his fools go
Meatchi, Trel a killer gotta have em make it to explode
Have to bring her to a show, she gon' bring all of her folks
And you should prolly Skype me I don't give no rollers telephone
*Peum* to the liquor store let me show you how I do it
Slutty Boys got all them Dolphins I coach em I'm Don Schuler
Non cooler y'all niggas be goin through it y'all foolish
We be gettin chauffeured, y'all niggas is carpoolin?
Board members only getting fried til I can't think
X's in her hand like its college night and can't drink
Its no secrets, I leave your ho speechless
From some of that poetry some strokin and some potent reefer
For sho' people I'm in my zone people
Alotta sugar in y'all tank tho its no equal
Easy, do this shit for D.C
Ironic Trel be rollin but he do be (dooby) out that E street

[Verse 3]
Look
And we can freak a melody, coolin where that heaven be
That mean Im way to high girl smellin' me better be
I just left from Melony and now I trap with Kelly B
Thats M.I.A. her a-i-m is great like it oughtta be
Bought a key, love to fool out, now she callin' me
Audible, boo you cute, I need dough from all of you
Yeah I'm tough and if I'm drunk enough I'll touch your mother too
Married so? I'll go, tell your father what it do
D.C. R US I suggest you buy a cup
I be laid back like peroxide in the cup
Coolin' wit my fool he foolin' wit them tools
I ain't tryin play the groom but I got hotel rooms what it do?
You can call your whole crew, bring em through
You ain't got a ask you already know what i'mma do
I'mma pop three prolly mess around and shootin' you
We can make a movie too startin' wit me chewin' you
And that's true

[Hook 1]
Look
You chewin' me, ask your girlfriend thats how its gotta be
And I know you got alotta broccoli but I got alotta cheese
So what you mean D.C. is my scene girl
Smokin purp and drinkin' purp and rakin' in the green girl
Im mean girl (what you mean girl?)

[Hook 2]
Look
I mean girl goin deep and beatin' up the spleen girl
Now she walkin' talkin' funny you may be my dream girl
I'm sayin' girl when you gon' let me touch it why you playin' girl
I can hold your hand but that don't mean I'll be your man nah I'm playin'
But "take you out to eat" ain't in my plan
But if you out wit me you gon' need paint on your feet and your hand
Beat it like them kitchen babies be beatin' on pan
She eat me then she go and leave me and freak wit my man
And we don't never sleep and she really don't understand
Until she showed up with some tree and some pretty freaks in her hand
Stop playin' joe underestimate me like a banjo
Hand so favorite quote "go head let my man go"
Backtrack to the climax no relaxin'
She love to throw it back and damn I love that back action
Its like I'm bout to move tomorrow the way I be packing
I bust and I'm gon' your baby father slackin'

[Hook 1]
