[Intro: Wale]
I know your situation ain't typical
But I think you gifted too
And I appreciate it
Now bust it open

(whoa) (Dance, Dance, Dance) x2

I don't wanna come off complicatin
But I been not too fond of my new lady
I just can't work wit an imagination
I just wan' see how far I can take her
She got me like

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
Look, that Malian skin tone, with the Chyna cheek bones
And the bambi ass, me, I just got some cash
And the girlfriend is bad, you the best I never had
You should bring the choppa back , I'mma buy this bitch a bag
You know Ralph, he got the Lex, but we can sex it in the Jag
You and her be neck and neck, I got them stacks they in the bag
And them Texans goin ham, in Atlanta doin bad
I'm in Cali throwin bands, In Miami I ont dance
And bitch you know you'll be my favorite stripper
Just make sure that when I see you I'mma hit ya
At Stadium drinkin liquor takin pictures
I keep some pussy and some swishers for my niggas

[Hook: Wale]
Shoutout to my fuckin favorite stripper (x4)
Shoutout to my fuckin favorite

And when she bust it open I say
(Bust it, Bust it, Bust it) (x2)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Call me bae before she leave
Cuz she say she make it easy to dance and dance
Gotta see it to believe
Gotta piercin in her cheek, got a piercin on her cat
And I'm thinking why Philippe's, fried wings is in the back
And I came wit Lil Meech, and i think he brought the strap
Ain't come to start no problems, I just came to drop a stack
PJ and 'gnac, me Trel and Blac
Went from PG and broke to PJ's and land
Shoutout to my mother fuckin stripppers
I ain't bout to go in if they don't be showin nipples, catch up (ca ca ca catch up)
Shoutout to my fuckin favorite strippers
I'm such a fuckin tipper probably pay for twenty tit jobs, ge ge get up

[Hook: Wale]

Get lost in the ice from a bag of mine she might call me tonight
Then that force she decides to go home of course she says "I'm sorry" inside I'm blown
But I'll be ok, KOD wit like 3 0k
Holmes from DOA give em Deon D
OD on bread if they can Beyonce
Shoutout to my fuckin favorite stripper
Onyx, Stadium, Magic, wit big ones
Shoutout to Professions and the take 1
Even if I never get her I'mma get her (my nigga)

[Hook: Wale]
