[Intro]
Rosedale, E Street, D Street
Fuck whoever don't like
You heard?

[Chorus]
I've been in the trap, I've been totin' my iron
In the kitchen grippin' my nine
I done put my life on the line, yeah
I've been gettin' money, ain't really got time
I put shooters on the opps' line
They ain't even comin' outside
We just want a homicide, we just want a homicide
Somebody gotta die today, somebody got die
We just want a homicide, we just want a homicide
Somebody gotta die today, somebody got die

[Verse 1]
When they killed my nigga Swipe, man, it changed my whole life
Told my nigga Mike Mike everything is alright
That's when gutta Frank White got it done on sight
50 round drum, nigga, run for your life
I'm my mama's last son, so I gotta get it right
Take a loss, I'ma rob, I'ma get it back tonight, no problem
Nigga, hell nah, we don't fight
If I make a body drop, in the mornin', take a flight, that's life
All these bitches fuckin' for a price, that's right
Opps came through last night, that was slight
Can't forget how my niggas spent the Ben on a bike
You say you a shooter, you know you are not the type
I've been on the low, I've been watchin' for the Feds
I've been writin' letters to my niggas in the Feds
You don't wanna ever make my shooter cut his dreads
No you can't hang, nigga, you too scared
Take him to the bridge, let him hang from the ledge
We gon' get your kid, nigga, all you see is red
That's just what it is, have you pissin' in the bed
Crack a real hitter, nigga, that's what I said
Glock in the Moncler, that's a lot of shots there
Rest in peace to T, he got shot there
It's so many killings, how you not scared?
That's when it was real, you was not there
I'm from where they call the bitch the red zone
Where we like to turn into a dead zone
Trappin' out the buildin' got the bread long
Two shots to the dome, nigga's head gone
I'm from where we hit 'em with the remix
Turn around and take it on some G shit
Opposition on some police shit
We gon' hit your block on some creep shit

[Chorus]
I've been in the trap, I've been totin' my iron
In the kitchen grippin' my nine
I done put my life on the line, yeah
I've been gettin' money, ain't really got time
I put shooters on the opps' line
They ain't even comin' outside
We just want a homicide, we just want a homicide
Somebody gotta die today, somebody got die
We just want a homicide, we just want a homicide
Somebody gotta die today, somebody got die
