[Verse1]
Burst a shot fifty shot hundred shot
Got em another nigga dead that's the least of mah problem
Talking to the feds am a fill you up with hollows
Can't take shots like we drinking out a bottle

[Chorus]
Use your head man  dead man dead man
Dead man dead man dead man dead man
He's dead man dead man dead man dead man
Dead man dead man put this money on your head man
Head man head man now you   dead man dead man
Dead man dead man

[Verse2]
I don't like no nigga i dont trust no nigga
Bitch fuck up bust you nigga
I got hundred and i got a hundred rounds
So to take your ass down am a rush yo nigga
Info SK AK all i really need bitch pay day
Tie his ass up we go put him in the trunk
Have a good time bitch JJ see yo nigga turn up with
The prepaid am a give the nigga no leeway
DC style hit em with the four pound
Am a leave his ass dead on the freeway
If it's little talk back and they want payback am
A hit the quad with a replay spread the whole
Block everybody face down run this shit back

Shot em another nigga dead that's the least of mah problem
Talking to the feds am a fill you up with hollows
Can't take shots like we drinking our the bodies

[Chorus]

Dead man dead man dead man dead man
He's dead man dead man dead man dead man
Dead man dead man put this money on your head man

[Verse3]
I'm rolling with soldiers they focus no love
They shoot first as we tryna survive
I'm a trap i can't starve i cannot take a lost
Nobody ain't taking what's mine i can't
I can't Die with a gun that doesn't make sense
Am a shoot till this bitch stop firing
Am a kill for mah bros am a kill till i find mah
Respect i swear i ain't lying
Fuck the he say she say can't pay no mind
If it don't get me paid he made
We made SV made bunch a made niggas keepin it real to the grave
Uck the he say she say can't pay no mind
If it don't get me paid he made
He made
We made SV made bunch a made niggas keepin it real to the grave
Thirty shot fifty shot hundred shot
Shot em another nigga dead that's the least of mah problem
Talking to the feds am a fill you up with hollows
Can't take shots like we drinking our the bodies

[Chorus]
Dead man dead man
Dead man dead man dead man dead man
He's dead man dead man dead man dead man
Dead man dead man put this money on your head man
Head man head man now you dead man dead man
Dead man dead man
