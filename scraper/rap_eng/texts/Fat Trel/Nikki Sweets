[Hook]
She say I’m a treal nigga, she say I’m a treal nigga
That’s why she love to fucks me
That’s why she love to fuck ...
I flew her from Indiana
I flew her from Indiana
She bought some chopper, a clipper, banana
Nikki tatted like a trap star
Had to introduce her to a foreign car
Trap star, a couple shows, a couple videos
And plenty pictures with the groupie ho

Nikki, oh Nikki Sweets
Nikki come and fuck with me
Nikki, oh Nikki Sweets
Nikki come and fuck with me
I think she will love me sweet
I think she will love me sweet

[Verse 1]
I was in Los Angeles when I ran into Nikki
I was drinking Pete Sirock and she was sipping remi
Hit the coco what we sosa, I told her come with me
Told up call her friends over, soldier I got bentley
A couple shots fired, 105 and a hemi
Pull about my side, like they fine when you with me
Careful rolling up the dope and plus she bout the blicky
I’m just shower baby bout her pussy sitting pretty
Nikki got the urge to get money and burn
I fuck her in the bed, I fuck up to her
I like to give her education and she play like a nerd
I’m talking head, ... catch up with my words
Plus I trust her with birds, I know this might sound absurd
But you see I tend to swerve, when I’m drunk off that syrup
All the swishers she burns, I’m in love with her
So when I leave the studio, I make the blood run her

[Hook]
Oh Nikki, oh Nikki
She say I’m a treal nigga, she say I’m a treal nigga
That’s why she love to fucks me
That’s why she love to fuck ...
I flew her from Indiana
I flew her from Indiana
She bought some chopper, a clipper, banana
Nikki tatted like a trap star
Had to introduce her to a foreign car
Trap star, a couple shows, a couple videos
And plenty pictures with the groupie ho

Nikki, oh Nikki Sweets
Nikki come and fuck with me
Nikki, oh Nikki Sweets
Nikki come and fuck with me
I think you in love with me
I think you in love with me
Nikki, come fuck with me
Nikki, in love with me
Nikki, come fuck with me
Nikki, in love with me
