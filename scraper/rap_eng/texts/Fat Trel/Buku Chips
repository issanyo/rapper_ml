[Chorus]
First off, I do this shit
Y’all niggas ain’t never been through this shit
Thirty round clip, might hit, might miss
Pussy nigga I don’t give a fuck who you with
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips

[Verse 1]
Taking trips with different bitches, my life is exciting
My life is a movie, yours truly the writer
If I like, I probably wife, I probably fuck in one night
I’m with Fred and the [?], getting money from Schnider
Her pussy from China, her body melodic
I’m slicker than Rick, she desire my fire
I give her that pain, left lane in the rain
I see the police, we saying no names

[Chorus]
First off, I do this shit
Y’all niggas ain’t never been through this shit
Thirty round clip, might hit, might miss
Pussy nigga I don’t give a fuck who you with
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips

[Verse 2]
White bitches in my kitchen, cooking, cleaning the dishes
Left wrist whip whipping, mama thought I was pimping
She told me I’m special and I should work with the given
Your back lifting weak, hand it over, I’ll lift it
I’m talking working with the preacher, serving cocaine in the bleachers
Pussy and power, I’m a sucker for sneakers
My new bitch a geeker, I fuck her, I leave her
But I be back, a couple macs and on my lap is a diva, nigga

[Chorus]
First off, I do this shit
Y’all niggas ain’t never been through this shit
Thirty round clip, might hit, might miss
Pussy nigga I don’t give a fuck who you with
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips

[Verse 3]
I’m patient when I’m waiting, laying under your house
I been plotting for hours, feel like your trap should be ours
Trip with the powder, box out with the [?]
I drink my liquid with swishers, my niggas up in the towers
Ask me how I found her like a brick on the counter
If she rich Imma dick her, if she snitch Imma out her
Give no fuck, I roll the dice, I probably hike up the price
Let your white bitch count it, call me back if you like it, nigga

[Chorus]
First off, I do this shit
Y’all niggas ain’t never been through this shit
Thirty round clip, might hit, might miss
Pussy nigga I don’t give a fuck who you with
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
White bitch count my buku chips
