[Hook] (x2)
Another body drop, another homicide
Bitches snitching, niggas dying
Police is watching, mammas crying
Choppers in the house, 30s outside

[Bridge]
(Choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers) Niggas dying
(Choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers) Niggas dying
(Choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers) These niggas dying
(Choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers) Niggas dying

[Verse 1]
Niggas doing life, snitches doing months
Free Lil Durk, this ain’t what you want
Choppers in the house, pumps in the trunk
Lean in my cup, dope in my blunt
First I pop me a chopper then you see a doctor
Liquor and ecstasy, Gucci and Flocka
Call me a roller, she give me the bopper
No, I’m not sober, you know I'm a shotta
Wait till it’s over, my shooters is proper
Trueys and Louis and Gucci and Prada
Police is plotting, I see 'em, I’m watch 'em
I spot 'em, I got 'em, I drop 'em, I shot 'em
Bitches is telling, and niggas as wellin'
Dreams and drugs and which is you sellin'?
Fuck is you thinking, my chopper's propellin'
Craziest weapon, I shoot at your melon
Bitches is telling and niggas as wellin'
Dreams and drugs and which is you sellin'?
Fuck is you thinking, my chopper’s propelling
Craziest weapon, I shoot at your melon

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Murder and money and money and murder
Niggas is shooting some shit you ain’t heard of
Only around if you smoking this servant
You losing on purpose, which strip is you working?
Police is lurking and niggas is nervous
They caught ‘em and told ‘em to come, it was urgent
They hit him with 5, he might be alive
But hurry, his body is burning
If they say he alive, then somebody lied
I seen them white sheets when his momma cried
If they say he alive, then somebody lied
Cause I seen them white sheets when his momma cried
They shooting for nothing, they shooting to kill
Choppers with drummers, they shooting for real
If you close, I'mma blow I hope you know the deal
It’s crazy, I know it but fuck it, it’s real
