The night has a thousand ears listenin to your cries
The night has a thousand eyes and they're all on you
The night has a thousand ears listenin to your cries

I was born broke but im a rich nigga
So its night night to them bitch niggas
Glock small but the clip bigger
Got 30 shots for them snitch niggas
Roll wit who I grow wit
Its over wit when that stove lit
Ditch the low we need mo bricks
Then we switch the hoes and take mo trips
Mo licks equals mo chips, so young yet so rich
Go get who you wanna get
Just don't bullshit when that 4 spit
Bus a nuts in that ho bitch
She pop a pill and take the whole dick
Me and her left the dealership never tell who im rollin wit
Im DC northeast tatted ho
Lots of money you can add it ho
Place the dick with them pussy lips
Put it to sleep and you can have the ho
Ride wit los and a older smoke
Backseat full of heat you think beef is sweet
East street may sb but I keep me a killer from southeast
Ride out never hide out that 4-5 take eyes out
You pay the plug with the pies out
Police behind you when you ride out
You hot nigga jus stop nigga
Never try to shop no block nigga
You should move n kill your goons
N try to find a new spot nigga

The night has a thousand eyes and there all on you
The night has a thousand ears listenin to your crys
The night has a thousand eyes and there all on you
The night has a thousand ears listenin to your crys

Look
They tell me my existence of scriptures hasnt been written
If there's a cure for being terrific I overdosed on that prescription
I am so determined like a german in the trenches
No nazi, jus aki, im blessed to be this gifted
Im so optimistic my pivot changes postions
Went from standin in the distance n now im so close sittin
Picasso couldn't paint a picture this vivid
Drawer in giant shoes and walked till I could fit em
What have you come to witness is a fighter in great fitness
Who broke all baracades and hopped the tallest fences
What I write in my composition will conquer all competition
Yes my theory and logic go mixed in with comprehension
Im relentless I share no forgivness
God forgives and I dont, see you will and I won't
Real as a speculation anger mixed wit ur hatred
Thats planted a mental tumor and admiration of greatness
Ammunations outrageous the animositys ageless
Animal instinct becomes annual and contagious
Hate me because I made it, love me because I didn't
Kill me for being real and applaud me because I finish
Pull me because im winnin, or diss me because im distint
Because I am the difference of talent im cold gifted
Maybe im jus the sickest unorthodox when I write
So I low to bed mourn and so long to my goodnight

The night has a thousand eyes and there all on you
The night has a thousand ears listenin to your crys
The night has a thousand eyes and there all on you
The night has a thousand ears listenin to your crys

Yo when son black out the sun black out
When I go in I dont come back out
Im too cold to exist I could sun the moon
Then moon the sun solar eclipse I
Dismissin the meannest niggas in a minutes time
Dispensin the sickest venom from a killers mind
Catch a body on the track like a marathon
Run and stumble then my fuckin arms at the finish line
They call me mr take another nigga bitch and break her
Penetrate her then eliminate her jus to get the paper
If peter piper picked a pepper than she better pay the piper
If I pipe her I could pimp her or sophisticate her
You bring her down but my swag on elevator
She jus wanna get down cuz I elevate her
Damn homie what you squaking about cuz im all in ur spouse
While you on the couch staring at the wall in your house
Ye she love to hum my songs
Cuz she only listen to em when my balls in her mouth
Ouch, what type of G am i, that was o.d, tmi
Well tell your BM dont DM me, cuz im in a bm, epmd
She d'in me and said G you fly, you drive me crazy like a dui
Skarr scoop me up and we flew bye
Trel came through with atleast two guys
You gon run this G with my G's to ma
Nuttin but a G up in these 2 eyes
Guess thats the penalty to be too fly
Bitch niggas dont wanna see you fly
Laugh now cry later when I squeeze you lot
And I won't stop hittin till I see you die, GOODNIGHT

The night has a thousand ears listenin to your crys
The night has a thousand eyes and there all on you
The night has a thousand ears listenin to your crys
