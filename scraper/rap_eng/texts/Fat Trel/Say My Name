[Intro :]
Say my name
Say my name and I'll aim at you
Say my name and I'll hang with you
Say my name and I'll aim at you
Say my name and I'll hang with you

[Hook :]
Niggas gonna talk but the guns gonna shoot
2 chickens and a k in my coupe
Don't play with my loot say my name and I'll aim at you
All these bitches want me because I'm young and got money with a  hunnit round tommy
For the right amount of pay shoot a Nigga in the face don't play with my money
I just want to tell the bitch she was never celibate pussy never relevant
Dick so big when i put it on her wig thought my daddy was an elephant
Cook shrimp with the steak so elegant
Ride like the president
Kill a nigga no evidence
Put him under my residence

[Verse 1:]
All i wanna know is if she gonna go for the bro
Put the dick in her throat
Give her what she needs start it off speed now i hit slow
All i ever wanted is a hunnit round tommy and a pocket full of money
House full of hoes and a mouth full of gold i blow my money
Her face on hundreds pussy taste like 20s her head on 50 so i let her fuck with me
Anytime a young nigga grow up with the wrong nigga he end up drug dealing
Give a fuck where he from outside with the pump and i hope he got the plug with em
Molly with the lean and the lean with the dope made ho go crazy
Call up bro what you know at the liquor store Finna go crazy
Every last bitch i fuck wanna save and hold my nuts
Getting head in a truck backseat window down with my feat kicked up
Riding smoking and drinking I see the police and i give no fuck
We don't give no fuck

[Hook :]

[Verse 2 :]
All i want to know is if she gonna ride for the clique  put a bug on the wrist
Started on the block popping bottles in the vile then we bel air sip
All i ever wanted was a bag full of richest and the bad ass bitches
And the rad paper tag and a brand new jag and a bag full of swishers
Im a sluttyboy killer and we don't fuck with new niggas
Give a fuck about the issue I just got a new pistol and it came with a missile
Anytime a young nigga grow up with the wrong nigga he end up drug dealing
Give a fuck what he want cause i got it in the trunk come and leave a couple of slugs with him
Booking all the bad ass strippers in the club with him still no love with him
Every Time he call me on the phone I be hoping he really got the plug with him
Every last nigga i rob told me it really was no problem
Cause they do it for the cars and the clothes and the hoes and i do it for the dollas
Ion need no partner I promise squad got pockets full of collars
With a house full of house and a mouth full of gold and a 9 full of hollows

[Hook :]
