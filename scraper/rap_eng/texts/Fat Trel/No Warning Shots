[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
I'm rappin' work just to keep the [?] away
After proper preparation then get sent away
In and out the game I made a smooth getaway
Who'd ever knew that I'd be rappin' work a different way
You niggas can't fit my pants, socks, or my shoes
Barely payin' rent, how the fuck you pay some dudes
I got my cars and my jewelry, oh I love my grind
You niggas ain't sold a brick until you wrote a rhyme
I see you rap niggas like hangin' out with ratchets
What makes it worse you suckers like to run in packs
My lil' nigga ridin' round with 30 in his Glock
He only shoot to kill he don't give no warnin' shots
Every city, every hood its the same story
Niggas [?] for a moment of glory
Gettin' money is my job and my past time
You suckas only rappin'
Boy I live this life of crime

[Chorus: Fat Trel]
Boy respecting where I'm at
[?] but I don't need a pass
Loyalty over the cash
Got my whole life sittin' in this stash
For a whip movin' fast
I don't move if it ain't about the cash
Duckin' suckas in the [?]
You gon' die if I don't pop up without the mask

[Verse 2: Yowda]
Feelin' like the realest which is fat nigga
Ask around how I'm 50 round at nigga
Poppin' up a flat throw it back quicka'
Catch a op, I'ma put him on his back nigga
Stop, I [?] rap niggas
Should'a ran how I motherfuckin' clock niggas
Anywhere I go, I got nigga
Couple racks, then we fuckin' up the sacks nigga
I just got a nigga
It wasn't robbery until I shot a nigga
Hunnid xans in the locker nigga
For a dolla' I'll break em' up proper nigga
And my nigga Yowda got a lot of niggas
Maserati drop head, whole lot nigga
Nigga gettin' big guap nigga
In the kitchen fuckin' up the hole pot nigga

[Chorus: Fat Trel]
Boy respecting where I'm at
[?] but I don't need a pass
Loyalty over the cash
Got my whole life sittin' in this stash
For a whip movin' fast
I don't move if it ain't about the cash
Duckin' suckas in the [?]
You gon' die if I don't pop up without the mask
