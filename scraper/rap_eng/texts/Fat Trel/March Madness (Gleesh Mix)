[Verse 1: Fat Trel]

While im staring in my styrofoam
Texting bitches off the iphone
Clock ticking like a time bomb
Model bitches popping tylenol
College bitches popping adderall
Pretty bitches washing dirty drawers
Tee and niggas fucking bitches raw
Me i just hold it dont get involved
Cop it we rock it and get it off
My youngin locked up for sellin soft
You gon regret if you wet it all
All of them niggas is fell it off
We getting richer and well off
She want a baby like hell naw
Mane that bitch crazy and fell off
She just might write her a tell all
Fucking bitches in the cut
Kicking bitches out the truck
I buy them liquor fill them up
Put my finger in her butt
Im counting money no rushing
Black 45 busting
Broke niggas sip tussin
Fucking police can't touch
Face famous mount rush
I just dropped muva russia
Apply the pressure wit the 47
AK's nigga mac 11
Bitch you rookie cookie still a veteran
She only use it if its a weapon
Try me i promise you armageddon
We want the money like o-11

[Hook: Future]
Dirty soda in a Styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
Til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gone let 'em have it
Ballin' like the March Madness
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's living lavish
Like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch, the molly made me fuck her even though she average

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]

Fuck all the basic bitches
Stadium cooling wit crazy bitches
Young nigga pull up in 86's
Whipping the baby no baby sitting
Me i just spit what im really living
Still in the trenches wit niggas killing
Im talking missions and really drilling
She need to pop her some penicillin
Fuck around you gon be outta here
Shoot up the spot and im outta here
So many shots you just gotta hear
Bitches like damn we just got in here
I make the city go real cool
None of my bitches a feel you
All of my niggas a kill you
Rapping and trapping we still do, real truth
Throw the money in the truck
Bag it up and make it puff
Then i vacuum seal it up
Tell them nigga good luck
Shoot up that bitch and im rushing it
Fuck all that wrestling , tussling
We want that money and other shit
Tryna get paid like the government
