[Intro: Fat Trel]
Want to come with me? GBE
We'll take a trip to ecstasy

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
She just called my phone, I just dope smoke
She said she tried of cheating, she leaving, she coming over
I told her bring some liquor with some [?]
Imma fuck you in my kitchen, could you suck me on my sofa?
Shut up and bend it over, bust that pussy open
Imma lick and Imma kiss and Imma get back down and stroke
Mami, what you know? You fuck with me, you sure?
I'm drunk, she rolling. She love me, I know
I saw her, I seen her, her 2 seater Beamer
I fucked her in the back, she said my penis is the meanest
She loving my demeanor, my royal dick the cleanest
Just a [?], bitch I know you see us

[Hook: Fat Trel]
Damn I'm in my zone, geeked up and I'm rolling
Your bitch with me, sipping RÃ©my, she sniff coke, she cold
Says she 19, fucking like she grown
Some might say I'm wrong, but I can't leave her alone
Long, gone, zone, geeked, rolling
Zone, zone, geeked, rolling
Zone, zone, geeked, rolling
Zone, zone, geeked, rolling
Ecstasy, baby

[Verse 2: Blood Money]
Lil' mama got me living lavish off the molly
Me and savage feeling savage, ready for whatever
Bitch I'm about that action, never lacking
Pistol packing Jascksons, tweak I let you have it
Watch what happen, if I clap then niggas disappear like magic
Who going suck on Blood Money dick? No, that nigga ratchet
I want me a bad red bitch, hair ain't never nappy
Keep her nails did, bang a cock cause she knows it's cracking
Any situation, mouth closed, whatever happens
Addicted to TRU REALigion, 30's in that pistol clapping
Friends with Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Jackson
She smoking pack, doing here, she selling crack
She hit the strip, she make it flip then get it back
