[Intro]
Yeah I just want all the money
Gang, yo nigga what you know
You say you tryna blow sum’n up
Blow it up for a bag, bags out here
Double O G (I just want all the money)
One hunnid
One hunnid, aye

[Chorus] [x2]
I just want all the money (I just want all the money)
I just want all the money (I just want all the money)
I just want all the money (I just want all the money)
I just want all the money (I just want all the money)
I’m now in Miami Gardens (I’m out in Miami Gardens)
They call it the Murder Gardenz (They call it the Murder Gardenz)
The killers are rolling with it (You killers are rolling with it)
My chopper’s not what you call it (I’m not talking bout what you call it)

[Verse 1]
She just want all the lean
No way in the Fanta thing
Go shopping for Rolex
Necklace and diamond rings
You tell me I’m everything
I go like the semi ring
There’s money I’m counting
They come like a fountain
So I can pay for everything
I told her I wanted chicken
She tell me to finger lick it
I holler at E Claire
I left she say fuck the chicken
Shopping at Wintour
She hate to see south beach
I say I’m a trendsetter
Let’s go in the city T

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 2]
Aye i pull on the 27, I think it’s 183rd
We sticking off these pills
I’m looking for me a bird
I pull up the signs
A young nigga told me I’m wilding
Told him I killed two in this town
You can just meet me in private
Make me call up my brother
That’s Young Bree aka Cutter
Tell the cops already bring a stroller
You know I’m a keep me a killer
My new bitch she a redhead
Copped her working a nail shop
If she can make up in KOD
She show me when the mail drop

[Chorus] [x2]
