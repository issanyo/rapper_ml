[Intro]
Finally Free out on all platforms, you know
Shout out to Future too man, bang
Ty what up? hahaha
Yeah, hold up

[Verse]
Check out the way I be pitchin' the yard
Picture me rollin', you picture me dog
She need a shovel, she diggin' me dog
I shot her brother for pissin' me off
Two million dollars, you mention me, y'all
Motherfuckin' teacher suspended me, y'all
I can't be fuckin' with Hennessy dog
'Member me, I got the remedy, y'all
Fuck all that talkin', I stay with a dog
Thirty my dick and I'm bustin' it off
Bitch niggas hatin', no brushin' it off
We gon' pull up in the summer and fall
K-Lo my bitch, they said K-Lo official
She wrap her lips 'round this dick like a whistle
She do no talkin', she pull up with missile
Beat me in face and you're never gon' see it
Fuck all these niggas, I stay with some hoes
Rockin' Givenchy from head to her toe
Fuck the police, I'ma keep me a pole
Cut me a street, I'ma let it explode
I heard some niggas was sellin' they soul
I'm out on business and bendin' the road
Fuck competition, I'm takin' the globe
Rolex my wrist and my bitch's is gold
I'm out in traffic and I got a load
They want no secrets, no secrets is old
Know where I'm at like I've been here before
Strap on my lap, in the summer it's cold
Diamonds is shinin', the clarity, y'all
I wrote this verse with a charity, y'all
Gave me a pack and I carried it all
Bust me a MAC and I'm airing it all
Still on parole and I don't care at all
I pop a perc and smoke two to the face
Karo and perc is a drug addict day
She got that torch, she gon' give it away
I eat that pussy like it's on a plate
Play with my pay, I pull up with the K
She with the funnel, I bling to the J
You UV king, nigga who want to race?
Louis V shoppin', I stay with some bands
I went to Paris, I'm fuckin' in France
Diamonds they glisten, they shinin', they dance
That ain't my dick, that's a glick in my pants
Not from North Views, then you don't understand
I mix my lean with the oxy and xans
Fuck with the gang then we killin' your clan
Free all my lil niggas still in the can
I took the Sprite and I put it on ice
Fuck on your bitch, this is every day life
Still in the kitchen, I'm whippin' the white
Pack on the flight and I'm keepin' it light
I miss that pussy, that pussy was tight
She miss this dick, I was hittin' it right
You can come kiss it and give it a bite
Fuck your new nigga, I'm hittin' it for life
Fuck how you feelin', I'm keepin' it G
Beefin' with me, we can keep it discreet
Beat up the dope, Ike and Tina with me
A two seater with me and a Beamer with me
That's a leaner with me, Aquafina with me
Fuck what you think, I'ma keep it with me
I got that work, I'ma shoot you a P
With these new two-two-threes I'ma serve you a key
Fuck on a flight but how cool would it be
Name a more fat nigga cooler than me
Behind the tints it's a shooter with me
I keep a stick and a Ruger with me
Pay for the rent with no name on the lease
I hit the shot, like my name on the free
Dickin' her down like my name on them sheets
I fuck with Future but I took the beat
Fuck all that talkin', I stay with some xans
I hit your street and get through to your man
See the police, I'ma switch up the plan
Dick in her throat, got her head in my hand
I went to sleep with a stick in the bed
Fuck prosectors, the clique, and the feds
Don't do computers, you heard what I said
I eat that pussy, she pullin' my dreads
Fuck the police, bitch I'm finally free
Trap like the eighties, I'm whippin' the Z
I know you lil niggas hatin' on me
Since you hatin' on me I'ma shoot up the street
Like I knew it would be, a bazooka with me
Smoke a nigga like a hookah with me
I'm in the vert with a Uzi with me
Fifty on me and I blew it for free
Yeah, fifty on me and I blew it for free
Yeah, I'm in the vert with a Uzi with me
I'm in the trap where the shooters would be
Yeah, I'm in the trap where the shooters would be
