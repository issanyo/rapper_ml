[Intro]
"What was your message?"
"The urgent message is drop everything
Craig's in trouble come quick"
"I don’t think that shit gon work"
"Just do it!"
Fuck them

There's a thot voice on the phone
Slutty boy got game
Bitch

[Verse1]
Say she wanna come suck dick
I’m like drop everything come quick
Bitch Craig's in trouble I’m getting head from double
I gotta dark skin light skin bitch
Serve and cut the flow you a witness
33 in KT pitch and they say a fuck nigga snitch
Bitch I’m on a road to the riches
Another nigga baby mother in my business
Too clean what you mean who kissin
Outside new whip blue ribbon
Nigga pull me to the money I’m a get it
Grandmother say I’m fucking up the kitchen
She say she sick of seeing all these stripper bitches
I'm like "The money they got it and (fuck off grandma)
Whatchu mean grandma stop trippin"
She say she tired dawg she ever see a stripper
I’m just happy cause she made a real nigga
LAX me and Ritchie Hilfiger
You woulda never thought that he a real spitta
Thot hoes like a young rich nigga
Why you kissing on your bitch young nigga
Why you slap her the wrist young nigga
I’m a hit her with the dick bitch nigga
See me on the tv like my name
Fetty DHD catching all the TDs
When she walk inside the house see a 100 flat screens
We can do it anyway I get green
I just copped the S5 cooling in the jet skies
I ain’t lying bitches parked outside
When I pull up on your strip in a black spaceship
Tell your bitch to get her ground off bitch (I'm parked outside)
Matter fact get your jaw off the floor
Pull your pants up and get your drawers off the floor
I don’t give a fuck I just saw this before
She would fuck around and call the lord Oh Lord
Say she sucking a dick for a new skate board
Young nigga from the block almost took a face off
I ain’t see shit young nigga Ray Charles
I be posted in the spot taking all the late calls

[Verse2]
Say she wanna come suck dick
I’m like drop everything come quick
Bitch Craig's in trouble I’m getting head from double

Serve and cut the flow you a witness
33 in KT pitch and they say a fuck nigga snitch
Bitch I’m on a road to the riches
Another nigga baby mother in my business
Too clean what you mean who kissin
Outside new whip blue ribbon
Nigga pull me to the money I’m a get it

She say she sick of seeing all these stripper bitches
I'm like "The money they got it and (fuck off grandma)
Whatchu mean grandma stop trippin"
It's Mr. Beat-a-thot I ain't never got a problem
I knock a bitch out World Star
She gon think she got hit with a mother fucking sock
Coming out the Safeway Coinstar
Hit the spot me and my nigga Bogaert
Northeast all them niggas go hard
You don’t want to see me layin in your yard
Reminiscing over you my God
I just the got the lean in the jar
So high I’ll be cooling with the stars
Nigga beat a drive by when they shot four time
We done killed 4 niggas so far
Who the fuck did told you I ain't have bars
Better off tellin' you that I ain’t have scars
Never got shot I ain't never been stabbed
My parents really bought me everything I ever had
Just won’t work I was really outside
Really selling coke I was really down to ride
Never homicide you can see it in my eyes
And you came back around bout motherfucking time
Three-six-five two-four I grind
When they killed Cap man that mother fucker cried
Went outside copped a new four five
Peep at my waistline I ain’t wash no time

[Verse3]
Say she wanna come suck dick
I’m like drop everything come quick
Bitch Craig's in trouble I’m getting head from double
I gotta dark skin light skin bitch
Serve and cut the flow you a witness
