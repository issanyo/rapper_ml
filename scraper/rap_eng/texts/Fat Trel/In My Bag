Sometimes I'm in my bag

Ooh, killin' em, ooh, ooh, killin' em
Fool think he smooth till that 32 hit 'em
Ooh, killin' em, ooh, ooh, killin' em
Fool think he smooth till that 32 hit 'em

[Verse 1: Fat Trel & Wale]
Okay sometimes I like to wake up that Rolex on my right
Sometimes I cop that act, I mix that shit with the sprite
I do a liquor to my left with your stripper on my right
And if gleetchi feelin' geetchi kiss that pussy goodnight
Alright, sometimes I'm goin' ape shit, cop that bape shit to death
Sometimes, I hit up soho cop it till it's none left, uh
Sometimes you got them broads, but can't keep your broads in check
Sometimes, you cop them airs, but I ain't wasting no breath
Sometimes I take a flight, trips of trafficking white
Sometimes I leave my wife and spend a night with my dyke
Sometimes I sip Ciroc, Belair Rose with the ice
Treat that pussy polite, sometimes I'm precise
Sometimes I sip Ciroc that Belaire Rose with ice
Treat that pussy like fuck it, I know just what you like
I know several bitches that do whatever for flight
I just slide em to gleesh, don't tell 'em the price

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Sometimes I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Bitch, I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Sometimes I'm in my bag I ain't even brag, nah

[Bridge]
Ooh, killin' em, ooh, ooh, killin' em
Fool think he smooth till that 32 hit 'em
Ooh, killin' em, ooh, ooh, killin' em
Fool think he smooth till that 32 hit 'em

[Verse 2: Fat Trel & Wale]
Sometimes I smoke, sometimes I drink, sometimes I pop the pink
I might wake up and go no shirt, I might just rock a mink
Sometimes I wear my thirty, I'm like bitch, what the fuck you think?
All we like is Franklin, Jacksons, Lincolns
Sometimes I hit the simi and my whole team is stanky
Sometimes I buy your bitches, sometimes's its just a trinket
Sometimes I like 'em famous, er'thang stay in Vegas
Bet yo lady fend that V, when I give her meat she thank me
I like to take a bitch that like to wait a bit, fake
And take a bit, feed her pills, shut her up, make her lay and take the dick
Make her flick, sunset Indiana Pacers bitch
Sometimes, I beat that pussy up, she call it Wonton
I spend a long night, love it when she on top
I beat that pussy up and then that 'mwah to that warm spot
Say I hit it, hit it, don't stop, quit it, hit it, long time
Bitch I hit it, hit it, don't stop, quit it, hit it, long time

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Sometimes I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Bitch, I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Sometimes I'm in my bag I ain't even brag, nah
Bitch, I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Sometimes I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Bitch, I'm in my bag
Bitch, I'm in my bag, you nah
Sometimes I'm in my bag I ain't even brag, nah
