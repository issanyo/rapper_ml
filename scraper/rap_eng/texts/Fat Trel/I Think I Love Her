[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
I call this bitch Miss pretty pussy
That pussy fat, that pussy cushy
Soon as we close the door, we fuckin'
I told my bros keep more I'm lucky
(Did he say why?)
She got that snapy napy doggy
I taste her clitoris and suck it
(I take that clitoris and fuck it)
That ass so fat get smack them puppies
I serve and pumpin' when I'm rushing
She love a hustler young and thugy
We out to eat, I pay for nothing
That's cause she got it, she be stunting
(Man my bitch be stunting)
And her pendant glow want it

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Got me cruising around all day
And I don't wanna cruise for a way
Hey we run to the money all day
Let them talk what they gonna say
On headshots if you think you can take on my bitch
In the AMG and my bitch in the M6
From the zoo thang and my Glock is my best friend
It's just zoo over here we're coming for them hoes
So sit Dalai Lama told you you got it
Come and take a tour on the zoo baby
And I think I'm fall in love with you baby
Every way you do it got me busting move baby
And so said Dalai Lama talk to you baby
Come and take a tour on the zoo baby
