[Intro: Fat Trel]
UGH
Yeah
*Clears throat*
It's bout that time mane
Well ugh

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
I got money in my eyes, no surprise, how I'm ridin'
Rappin' all the time I'm just waitin' on my signin'
Rappers on their heels, I was trappin' while reclinin'
Wonderin' what took that boy Wale so long to find her
Mindin' my business, but all the haters in it
That's why when I'm preformin' they never want me to finish
And I'm just warmin' up, the liquor keep me replenished
My swag so different, North East significance
Rappin' got me gettin' it, chillin' on my Gilligan
Island got my wildin', and stylin', and poppin' Ritalin
Geekin' just to spit again, studio gigglin'
Laughin' at my past, and then askin' to call my bitch again
Tell her to come over in that Rover and let me hit again
Watch her legs open, that ocean where I be swimmin' in
Hopin' that the coast ain't clear, so I can open it
And let the whole city, and Maryland Virgina listen in

[Verse 2: Wale]
Tell E Street don't worry we gotta 'em
Nigga jump out lemme know if there's a problem
High tail Prada, pop my collar, son y'all nigga's ???
Pickin' up Trel on the way down bottom
??? to the Chronic ???
L.V. jeans so my posites Copper
Doin' pretty good for a nigga quit college
HUH, I'm just countin' my cottage
ROC nation, y'all know Mr. Carter
Stop hatin DC, know I got ya
MoCo too, no, a nigga ain't forgot ya
Switchin' up lanes, all black thang
Fried than a mug with some porno Dame
I don't sell drugs, but my boy got Cane
Niggas cookin' up pies like Digiorno, mane
HUH, I'mma keep a nigga off the street
So please stand for the whole North East
MoCo bang, lil G-R-E, Fat Trel'd up, A-L-E, BIOTCHH

[Verse 3: Fat Trel]
Ride through my city with a bad ass bitch
Bad ass 40 with a 30 round clip
Put it on my hip let a nigga bullshit
And I react like Gucci and then I dip
Say you gettin' tips, bitch I sold like six
And I sold more hoes than you sold bricks
Can't see the ???
And I drink more O cups, take more pictures
White and yellow diamonds she know that's my shit
Phat ass and tits, you know that's my bitch
Sixteen 'hunnid block ???
So you know I copped a 'hunnid block of that shit
Like fuck school, rather fuck hoes, count my bread, smoke more Dro
Pop more ???
Go to Go-Go's, and stunt on bitch nigga's and bad ass hoes
On the highway doin' one-six-o
Laughin' at the bread fallin' out my window
UH, Fat Trel smoke ??? and my weed ain't grained, for yo info
Purp in my cup make me fuck slow
But when I blend up than the bitch won't know, and UGH
That's when down South she go, blowin' kid dick like a Saxophone
Lul money, can't leave them stacks alone
Nigga's to scared to react with the zone
Fucked ya baby mova, told her go on home
Now I heard the bitch love me and she playin' on my phone
Like bitch, "SO WHAT", bitch "SHUT UP"
Tell ya baby fava, I'ont give uh fuck
When he see me, he gon' be strapped, when he see me ask me "What's up"
E Street bang, let the pump lift 'em up
Throw 'em in the trunk nigga, light his ass up
UGH, Fat Trel, I'on't really give ah fuck
Nigga, North East, E Street, sippin' on da cup
That's Grey Goose, that shit straight
Got my pocket my shit paid
Aye Wale, say "What's good"
Next day we go get that K, and we can go get that cake
Like what you nigga's bake
