[Intro]
ProtegeBeatz
Yeah
Yung Lan on the track
We got one, another one, yeah

[Chorus]
Hit the water with the ice, watch it lock tight (Lock tight)
Chopper hit a pussy nigga like a shark bite
She wan' me introduce her to the boss life (The life)
I got six college bitches and they all dykes (Mwah)
Wait, how the fuck you niggas say you in the conversation? ('Sation)
Told him I'd be back, the stupid nigga really waitin'
I just told her take the demo straight to regulation
If you really wanna make it, it requires separation (Yeah)

[Verse]
I just had a threesome, one was Asian, one was Haitian (Haitian)
I just count them hundreds, never had an education (At all)
I can make it rain, I predict precipitation ('Tation)
We just really fuckin', she just think we really datin' (Boy)
Fuck the opposition, niggas bitches, really hatin' (Boy)
If you ain't got my money, I don't need no explanation (Boy)
I be so high, it look like I'm meditatin' (Boy)
I was in the sky, Mac Miller medication ('Cation)
I just poured a six in a deuce, tell the truth (Truth)
Niggas wanna call a truce, I'm just rollin' with the troops
You know I ain't hesitatin', when I see you, I'ma shoot
Fuck around and spin the block, real niggas absolute
Boy I was really gettin' it, whippin' chickens by the school
I sit back and paid attention, you was prayin' I would lose
I think I forgot to mention how you played me for a fool
Like I work on transmissions in your hood with the tool
I be breakin' all the rules, me and Meechy playin' pool
Bitches chillin' by the pool, I'm a real good dude (Dude)
I like bitches with some ass and a bad attitude
I'ma smack her with some cash, I'ma play it off cool (Mwah)
I'ma do the speed limit, I'ma ride real smooth
Niggas know I really get it, smile bright like the moon
Back when was rockin' fitted, I was travelin' on the pivot
Mama made I got suspended, but that shit was over business

[Chorus]
Hit the water with the ice, watch it lock tight (Lock tight)
Chopper hit a pussy nigga like a shark bite
She wan' me introduce her to the boss life (The life)
I got six college bitches and they all dykes (Mwah)
Wait, how the fuck you niggas say you in the conversation? ('Sation)
Told him I'd be back, the stupid nigga really waitin'
I just told her take the demo straight to regulation
If you really wanna make it, it requires separation ('Ration)
