[Intro]
Mama KaSaun At It Again

[Chorus]
I need more motivation, ha (More motivation, ha)
I need more medication, ha (More medication, ha)
I just wanna get by, just wanna get high
That's more levitation, ha (More levitation, ha)
It's back to the basics, ha (Back to the basics, ha)
But my new bitch ain't basic, ha (New bitch ain't basic, ha)
Kitchen is white, whippin' that white
They might think I'm racist, ha (Might think I'm racist, ha)
I should call up KaSaun, ha (KaSaun, ha)
Rolex on my arm, ha (On my arm, ha)
Got your bitch on my arm, ha (My arm, ha)
My dick is the bomb, ha (Dick is the bomb, ha)
Ring the alarm, ha (Ring the alarm, ha)
I get 'em gone, ha (I get 'em gone, ha)
You know I had it, call me your daddy
Fuckin' your mom, ha (Fuckin' your mom, ha)

[Verse 1]
Okay, back to the basic, I never was lazy
I bought a location and bought a Mercedes (Whew)
Back in the trap, in the kitchen, go crazy (Crazy)
Where, where, where? I be there, debate it (Whew)
The legals workin' for minimum wage (Wage)
Pick up a book and roll up with the page (*Inhale*)
I'm off the leash like a beast in a cage (*Growl*)
Still in the street, I get three for the eighth (Eighth)
Beefin' with me, we can meet with a K (B-r-r-r)
I'm off the drink in the booth in the A (Mwa)
Pop me some buddha and I'll shoot out the way (Whew)
Play with my loot and get two to the face (Bop-bop)
I tell the truth, we can do it today (Ayy)
You wouldn't sleep if I knew where you stayed (Facts)
Still on the beach with a freak in the shade (Mwa)
Call up PT, we gon' make us a play

[Chorus]
I need more motivation, ha (More motivation, ha)
I need more medication, ha (More medication, ha)
I just wanna get by, just wanna get high
That's more levitation, ha (More levitation, ha)
It's back to the basics, ha (Back to the basics, ha)
But my new bitch ain't basic, ha (New bitch ain't basic, ha)
Kitchen is white, whippin' that white
They might think I'm racist, ha (Might think I'm racist, ha)
I should call up KaSaun, ha (KaSaun, ha)
Rolex on my arm, ha (On my arm, ha)
Got your bitch on my arm, ha (My arm, ha)
I think it's the bomb, ha (Think it's the bomb, ha)
Ring the alarm, ha (Ring the alarm, ha)
I get 'em gone, ha (I get 'em gone, ha)
You know I had it, call me your daddy
Fuckin' your mom, ha (Fuckin' your mom, ha)

[Chorus]
Fuckin' your mother, you knew I didn't love her
I walk in that bitch while you fixin' her supper (Haha)
Play with my shit and get hit with an upper (Upper)
We gettin' high off the downers and uppers (Uppers)
My molly pink, if you look at the colors
The book about me, if you readin' the cover
If you look around me then you won't see no suckas
Ten toes in the street, I keep heat on my brothers (Bow)
I want a flight with a vic and a brick
I got one you can smoke and one you can sniff
Your new nigga's a joke, I'm as real as it gets
I'm just givin' 'em hope, you just hopin' they miss (B-r-rah)
I'm on a beach with a freak in a boat
I go to sleep with my feet on the dough
One hand on my dick, other hand the remote (Mama)
Laughin' at niggas 'cause you niggas jokes

[Chorus]
I need more motivation, ha (More motivation, ha)
I need more medication, ha (More medication, ha)
I just wanna get by, just wanna get high
That's more levitation, ha (More levitation, ha)
It's back to the basics, ha (Back to the basics, ha)
But my new bitch ain't basic, ha (New bitch ain't basic, ha)
Kitchen is white, whippin' that white
They might think I'm racist, ha (Might think I'm racist, ha)
I should call up KaSaun, ha (KaSaun, ha)
Rolex on my arm, ha (On my arm, ha)
Got your bitch on my arm, ha (My arm, ha)
I think it's the bomb, ha (Think it's the bomb, ha)
Ring the alarm, ha (Ring the alarm, ha)
I get 'em gone, ha (I get 'em gone, ha)
You know I had it, call me your daddy
Fuckin' your mom, ha (Fuckin' your mom, ha)
