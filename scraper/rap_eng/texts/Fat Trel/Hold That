[Intro: Mi$tro]
I just pulled the condom off of my dick
Before I wrote this verse (laughs)
Aye Nilo bring some more bitches
Through this joint


[Hook 2x: Yung Nilo]
If he ain't talking money
You can tell them hold that
If she ain't for the team
You can tell them hold that
Bring them drinks on back
Baby you can hold that
I got a stack and a rack
Oh no you can't hold that


[Verse 1: Mi$tro]
Mi$tro I'm sucker free
Smoke Newports on yo mama couch
Fucking hoes with J-Real
Well I'm sipping lean, I'm from the south
Allergic to that bullshit
Niggas change, I stay the same
Gang bang yo girlfriend
Then bust a nut then yell gang gang
My steez is on Jurassic
Nilo this one a classic
Power like David Stern, bossing like John Madden
Take over like a tonka
Shocking people like blanca
Control the people like Hitler
Fear my voice, like Osama
Subtracting from all the lames
Nigga I divide and conquer
1-9-9-2 say my mother birthed a monster
Mason Taylor no faking
Well respected like Reagan
Getting topped off Clinton
While focusing on my Franklins
Motivated by money
My ambition is expensive
Fucking the finest bitches
Ignoring all of the friendships
This is not a game, shaking hands with the fame
M-I-$-T-R-O gang gang


[Hook 2x: Yung Nilo


[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
All I want for Christmas
Is two filthy stripper bitches, on my back
They gone suck me, they gone fuck me
That's a fact, smoking pack
If that bitch don't pay for me, we take her back
First I Ciroc it Rose' it with no chase & throw it back
We got that, on the crack
All I wanted was a stack
Now I'm on and we Patron
And in the zone and throwing racks out
Make me disrespect her sex
And flex and throw her back out
Maybe he just play me
Fuck around and fuck her tracks out
Slutty boy, I ain't lying when I say she on your boy
Stacks never fold boy, Pillsbury dough boy
Dro boy, Oklahoma dro aroma getting it
Rental whip and my intentions is to flip [?]
Serious, I'm crazy in the brain my shit delirious
All I know is money kid, money keep my pockets big
If she ain't trying to fuck
Tell a hoe to snatch back
I be fly and all black, that's a fact
Throw a stack


[Hook 2x: Yung Nilo]


[Verse 3: Yung Nilo]
Hold that, pour that a little bit mo'
If she ain't for the team she can hit that door
Buzz so high, but my eyes so low
It's Yung Nilo if you fools ain't know
It's my time, I'm a shine fasho'
No days off how the grind going go
I don't wait in lines no mo'
Pop one, got one, I'm going roll
North East DC, I love my home
Caroline County better give me that thrown
9 years of hard work can't you tell
Got me in the studio working with Fat Trel
Now I'm in the game they better give me an iso
Hold that, kodak, Mason Taylor Mi$tro
Whole time I been flexing G
You mad your girlfriend texting me
You let her meet moms, I'm a let her meet the team
I'm only 18 with them stacks in my jeans
Double cup love, I'm probably bent off of lean
Junior Click I love my click
My style raw, no rubbers chick
I'm that kid, you can feel it in your gut
If you ain't talking about money
Tell a hoe shut up
If she need something to hold
Then tell her hold these nuts
Faded off Bacardi, studio look like a party
I'll probably sext your shawty
While I'm rolling off a molly
Lokos on deck, big green looking like Shrek
Get respect with the tech, she get respect with the neck
