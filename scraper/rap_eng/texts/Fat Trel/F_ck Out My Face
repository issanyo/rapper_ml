[Intro]
We just wanna
We just wanna puff big dope
I get it for a nice cheap price
Huh? Watchu like

[Hook]
And we don't wanna talk about dreams
(dreamt all night when we lived that life and we twice as nice)
We just wanna puff big dope
(when we leave the show it's just to go fuck some hoes)
I get it for a nice cheap price
(with a Brightseat dyke and a D.C. freak Ima eat all)
I'm gleesh so I know she like
(In my northeast streets I'm a mothafuckin' G, need no "oh peep")
I tell em get the fuck out my face
(Ion play them games, Ion fuck with no lames, I ain't countin' no change)
And you don't get to eat what I ate
(fat sub with a steak, mac n cheese on my plate, I'm a pimp Ima ache)
I tell em get the fuck out my face
(Ion play no games Ion fuck with no lames I ain't countin' no change)
And you don't get to eat what I ate
(fat sub with a steak mac n cheese on my plate I'm a pimp Ima ache)


[Verse 1]
Ugly mothafucker up and coming from the gutter
Youngin' love to hustle, know he get it from his mother
Money getting different, It's switching I'm seeing colors
The very minute I get it I’m sending it to my brother
Stunting in the summer, my stripper whippin' a hummer
I ain’t gettin' younger I needed to get a number
White dope runner, strap toke gunner, In the trap with the crease
Like the white ghost hunters
I ain't finna cop unless I like those numbers
I ain't finna rock on fuckin' an undercover
If I get locked lil bro drop a block, I'll be sneaking and eating the commissary on top
A nigga tried to snub me, but trust me I never rock
And that nigga be acting like a mothafuckin' cop
A bad bitch acting like a mothafuckin' thot
So I don't want sex just the mothafuckin' top
Northeast nigga whole clique go crazy
Stuff a bitch house with some binaural babies
Shit ain't been the same since they killed my nigga whoop, me and killa go crazy
Northeast nigga whole clique go crazy
Stuff a bitch house with some binaural babies
Shit ain't been the same since they killed my nigga whoop, me and killa go crazy

Verse 2]
Ugly mothafucka up and coming from the gutta
Youngin' love to hustle, know he get it from his motha
Money getting different, It's switchin' I'm seeing colors
The very minute I get it I'm sending it to my bruva
Stuntin' in the summer with a hunnit round drummer
Bitch walk a mile through the rain and the thunder
Might be up town with the sheets and the funnel
Or out Chiraq, rest in peace J Munna
Switchin' through the lane, gettin' brained in the hummer
Niggas ain't the same, Ima change in the summer
If I get locked lil bro drop a block, slide on the opps with the choppas and the Glocks
Sluttyboy gang got the mothafuckin' box
Lotta money comin' shit just won't stop
Saw him with a lean, knew he wouldn't get far
You ain't know your deem mothafucka kufa
Northeast nigga whole clique go crazy
Stuff a bitch house with some binaural babies
Shit ain't been the same since they killed my nigga whoop, me and killa go crazy
Northeast nigga whole clique go crazy
Stuff a bitch house with some binaural babies
Shit ain't been the same since they killed my nigga whoop, me and killa go crazy
