[Intro]
I don’t know how I feel about this
I’m a leave this one up to Slizz
Hey Slizz this is up to you

[Verse1]
Yea look contemplating to a side
Like who is true or who is losing you or I
To tell the truth I rather you to scrutinise
Black nigga on a white beat do or die
Microphone the only thing we utilise
I treat them like my brother so they utilize
I can see catastrophe and genocide
And everyday I wake up it’s a homicide
Look in my daughter and see she traumatised
Los Angeles I kiss another son of mine
Niggers mannerism is getting penalised
Eating fish shrimp and chicken when it is dinner time
Its find me at the finish line
Gucci Lou that Finny line
Silly nigga give me mine
I hope you hooked up with that semi nine
I’m looking at survival shit I read them
All this money I be making do I need it
The way these be treating I’ll be leaving
I will erase all my sins or just delete them
I’m looking at the bible
I might hurt a lot of people feeling doing this
Got her bible my mama gave me a Bible
I’m looking at the Bible look
So I be contemplating suicide
They be locked three of my shooter up
I be traumatised and I read it on the fine line
But manslaughter not bad for a homicide
I bull you not these crackhead ban 35 and
Free phones and free gizzle nigga two times
I try to tell a nigga who is lying
Who is shitting no match walk down fire
Find me at the finish line
With a blue nose nine nigga
Commit plenty crimes
New mercedes outside from them 65’s
High speed and got police searching city wide
Find me at the finish line
Or sacks 5th that gucci 5th and semi line
Silly nigga give me mine
I’m about to hug and kiss my mamma 99 times

[Chorus]
I have this bible should I read it
All this money I be making do I need it
The way these be treating I’ll be leaving
I will erase all my sins or just delete them
I’m looking at the bible
I got a bible my mama gave me a bible
I’m looking at these bible

[Outro]
Yea dear heavenly father
Forgive me cause I have sinned
Even with a bible in my hand
Got my ethnonym in my other hand
Keys in my back pocket
Im drinking white liquor
Smoking a newport
No lifes I just came to tell you that
You know I’m really sorry
