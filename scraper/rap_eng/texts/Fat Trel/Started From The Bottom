Fat Trel Nigga
Slutty Boy Gang
DC 1135, you already know what the fuck it do
Huh..
Louie V Mob, Duct Tape, No Limit Forever nigga (These niggas forgot)
Free Sosa......and all that there

Look..

Gleetchi never gave a fuck about them other niggas
Lot a niggas fuckin with them sucka undercover niggas
Brother, I was trying tell you something you on know
Got my niggas on ya ass with them K's at your door
When them choppas in my hand, the body on the floor
Throw them grams in the bag, get the cash, lets go
Rock, roll, her pussy on swole
Bitches at the Super Bowl, super dough giving dome
I'm in my recliner, you need a reminder
That I got all the bitches nigga case you tryin find them
Green dot, red dot, I can outline him
White sheet, black bag, white folks find ya
Think it was designer, maybe it was Chyna
Fuck her in the forum, she bought me designer
She say she in love, I say I be back
When I left Projects nigga flexing with this sack
Murder on my neck, 30 shot tech
Helly Hansen sweats, Northface vest
This 30 on my right, will leave a nigga left
Take a nigga life, leave a nigga stretched
I know that it work when we make his momma hurt
And if it's really real, nigga catch his momma first
Instagram the pic, put that on a shirt
Take away her purse, she gon need some dirt
And maybe a couple of flowers, we gon be here for hours
Nigga we stopping until this whole world ours
Plus I got the pussy with the pills and the power
Pistols and pumps, pick up some dunks
Ho out and show out, we smoked out the blunt
Come from the know bout, that no couch, you done
You see us, we jump out, don't stand there just run
A gun bout, no fun bout, I come out the one
Everyday I work, your bitch look like a bum
I wouldn't let her suck my dick with her Grandmothers tongue
Ever since I can remember nigga I been on the run
The way I deliver niggas for scrilla it's getting fun
And I be with gorillas my niggas is from the jungle
Pack of backwoods, no sheets, no funnel
Fighting in the level, stuntin' in the tunnel
Fucking in the neon, you niggas is peons
I don't even see them, I'm so fucking high
And your money on low and I'm probably the reason why
Y'all might be broke forever cause I might just never die
I get better with this cheddar, beretta's and 4 5's
Look me in my eyes, I ain't never lied
Interrogation, investigation get no reply
I pay my lawyer to win, I pay my lawyer to lie
I pay my lawyer to stunt, I pay my lawyer to fry
Homicide
