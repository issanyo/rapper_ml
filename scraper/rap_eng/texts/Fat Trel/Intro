Where I’m from
I’m from the west side of Chicago
Shout right Treal he is from DC
Running on DC streets man
He out there on Projects man
Heavy capital man
We ain’t even going to talk about it here
We ain’t gonna talk about when I first
Came out there and was cracking man
It was too lit a lot of scone scone scone
And a lot of shit we ain’t going to talk
About it man but man shit gets real
(Shit gets real)
