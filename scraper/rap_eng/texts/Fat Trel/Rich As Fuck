[Intro]
When I Was Twisted, Fuckin' Bitches In My Range Rover, Told Your Bitch I needed Assistance, She Just Came Over
And Now She Know My Name, Know My [?]. And If She Spends A Night Again, Well Shit. It's Game Over

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
Okay, My Texas Bitch Keeps Texting Me, Calling, Crying, Stressing Me, 'Bout Where I've Been
But I've Been With Another Bitch, Allegedly. Actually I'm Runnin' Red Lights Like
They're After Me, Arguing The Whole Time, She's Just Crazy, My Dick Is A Gold Mine
Wifey And My Girlfriend Tying Up My Phone Line, Trynna Double Team, But If You Ask Me
They're Both Lying
My Mother Called Me And Told Me It's Your Time
And This Is Too Real, They Can't Revoke Mine

[Hook]
Well I'm Rich As Fuck And I Came Up, And My Mama Told Me She Caught Me Countin' Them Bands
And I Say Mama We Did It, I'm Sippin' Ciroc With Diddy, I'm Fuckin' Bitches With Rose'
I'm The Man
I'm Rich As Fuck, I'm Screaming Yeah (I'm Rich As Fuck)
Yeah. I'm Rich As Fuck I'm Screaming Yeah (I'm Rich As Fuck)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
Well I'm Rich As Fuck And I Came Up And My Mama Told Me She Caught Me Countin' Them Racks (Them Racks)
(Them Racks)
I Just Switched It Up, I Don't Give A Fuck, I'm In A Bigger Truck, Smoking Bigger Blunts With My Strap.(Them Racks)
(My Loud)
But Really Though, I Get The [?] Like I'm From [?]
Bank Account Is Only Et Cetra, Can't Fuck With Extra Hoes
Flying To Atlanta, Depending On How The Weather Goes
California, Just To Pour The Lean Like Extra Slow

[Hook]

[Outro]
When I Was Twisted, Fuckin' Bitches In My Range Rover, Told Your Bitch I needed Assistance, She Just Came Over
And Now She Know My Name, Know My [?]. And If She Spends A Night Again, Well Shit. It's Game Over
