[Intro]
They say Kuku Gang put more violence
This Chicago n*gga
Ain’t rocking man 4CG 2 man
Dropping 440 for my n*gga zay blacks okay

[Hook]
They say Kuku Gang put more violence
They say all you boys need whiling
All of us pistol packing
Run up in the sturdy cloud bitch
They say Kuku Gang put more violence
They say all you boys need whiling
All of us pistol packing
Run up in this sturdy cloud bitch

[Verse 1]
Be stop trying to drop a demo Kuku
Got a guts I gotta do what I gotta do
I gotta slide through the ops shit
I gotta go
Cops were shit
These ops be roped in
They trying to bang but they talking
These ops be blocked in
That’s why I’m Kuku in traffic
Op hoes on my dick (on my dick bitch)
But them hoes is ratchet
Give a op bitch the whole clip
These hoes be runnin they lips

[Hook]
They say KuKu Gang put more violence
They say all you boys need whiling
All of us pistol packing
Run up in this sturdy cloud bitch

They say all you boys need whiling
All of us pistol packing
Run up in this sturdy cloud bitch

[Verse 2]
They say the fucking slutty boys whiling
Bumping fetty bitch she wet in silence
Money time all the time grinding
Kuku Gang got to finish winding
A lot of dope should be white as diamonds
She hit a line she can’t close her eyelids
Spending money we can speak in private
I hit the kitchen check or brake and dive in
Swimming pool full of strippers diving
You watch your back in these streets or you’re dying
My n*gga shot that hit me him like I did
My bitch she went shish like I kick

[Hook]
They say Kuku Gang put more violence
They say all you boys need whiling
All of us pistol packing
Run up in this sturdy cloud bitch
