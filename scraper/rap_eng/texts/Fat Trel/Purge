[Intro]
We support the Purge

Ready to violate annihilate and cleanse our soul
So we may Purge as we please

[Intro: Fat Trel]
Gang, Meek, you up?
Southside shore

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
Try me I'm comin' though shootin' shit me and my young nigga Ludacris
.30 a .50 a 100 clip none of my niggas is new to this
I was just dreamin' of getting it then I woke up and I'm livin' it
Countin' on spending this money you idiot it make no difference
I just say fuck all the beefin' and go and get right at the dealership
All of these pictures we takin' I'm thinkin' the police is intrested
I go fly away to a much better day but my bitch say don't mention it
Whats up with that pussy I'm fuckin' that pussy I'm  suckin' I'm pinching it
Come from the city of Bobby and Whitney my smoke is illiterate
Smokin' the bay while I make me a play and my faces say ignorant
I should pull up on a nigga buck-buck but these niggas not with the shit
They just be hoping for niggas and bitches to say what they witnessin'
Five years down I come back around and kill shit
I should research you I hope it don't hurt you cus you not legitimate
Fuck is you talkin' bout my young niggas wildin'
My gun go with every thing I don't need no stylist

[Bridge: Fat Trel]
Purge I need a Purge
Purge
Cleanse your soul

[Hook: Fat Trel]
It's 30's on everything got work ?
And you can have all my money if you kill me and find it
They ask why I'm purging and preaching this violence
All I hear is shots, polices and sirens

[Verse 2: Chris Bo]
And I'm on yo ass boy gone cleanse yeah they owe me that
I'm tired of your tough talk you livin' that phony act
He out and he purge too he liein' I know he not
Them ? for fuck niggas I see from the zodiac
Running just making it worth got a scope and I'm aiming for ligaments
We deep in the front and the back of your house now thats a predicament
My niggas is stupid retarded yeah I know some bitches that's ignorant
They know what the fuck you just started they want we to slide up and finish it
Nobody can save you not even a good man
AR on the right side machete the bookbag
Red dot on his forehead gone give him a good bath
All black like we ninjas ? foot clan

[Bridge Fat Trel]
I mean this the best time of the year for me
I get to cleanse my soul and just ahh

[Verse 3: Chris Bo]
I just pulled off in the whip with a drum in my flip I could hurt a man
With niggas that don't give a shit
They gone give you the clips they from murder land
My bitch she geekin' to purge keep tellin' me to give her a chance
Four niggas six drums in the trap but we heavy as shit in the caravan
Polices done blew up the spot but thats not tonight and I'm lovin' it
I might just search for a glizzy and open this top up and
Purging horny as fuck I was thinking bout toppin' in 3rd grade
Only way you won't get shot is you runnin' and hide in a bird cage

[Hook: Fat Trel]

[Verse 4: Chris Bo]
Figured that you ain't bout it where yo triggas at
Talkin' like you all for it but I know you not where you at light a cigarette
I just grab me the biggest shovel I've been cappin way where you livin' at
And I dug you up the biggest hole you can get in that

[Outro]
We can enter any home we want
No force is to hurt you
We don't wanna kill our own
Please just let us Purge
