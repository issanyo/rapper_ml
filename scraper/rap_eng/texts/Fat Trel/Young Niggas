[Intro]
Hey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey
Hey ey ey ey

[Hook]
Hey ey my young niggers told them 30 shots
Ey all my strippers strip for dirty dollars
Smoke about 30 swishes I got 30 problems
Then you niggers let the police get the word about them
Ey my niggers roll with 30 shotters
Ey all my strippers strip for dirty dollars
Smoke about 30 swishes I got 30 problems
Then you niggers let the police get the word about them

[Verse 1]
All my strippers get them pussy poppin
I’m a junkie smoking racing basin choosing droppin
My CEO just told me boy you got a problem
I’m sitting on pussy niggers don’t give a fuck about them
I’m crushing down my block I sit like Richie ballin
You play around with my shit i have your whip growling
Don’t ask me about no bodies you haven't found them
Bitch don’t ask me about no bodies if you haven't found them
Now everyday I have to make a couple thousands
She in the shower and trappin like ain’t getting
No fucking thought about it
I’m thinking about my bitch I’m feeling like fucking around
I feel to go and bust a couple rounds

[Hook]
Hey ey my young niggers told them 30 shots
Ey all my strippers strip for dirty dollars
Smoke about 30 swishes I got 30 problems
Then you niggers let the police get the word about them
Ey my niggers roll with 30 shotters
Ey all my strippers strip for dirty dollars
Smoke about 30 swishes I got 30 problems
Then you niggers let the police get the word about them
