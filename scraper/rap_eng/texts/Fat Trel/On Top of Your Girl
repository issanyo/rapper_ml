[HOOK: Fat Trel]

I say what's Poppington baby
We Slutty Boy Gang
We so popular baby
We on top of your girl
Come and shop with us baby
Got some cock
Need some rocks
Catch some shots with us baby
We'll bop with your girl
First I start with the..?
Get her legs open
Her pussy keep calling me
I proceeded to stroke it
I'm drunk and she rolling
And I can't focus
I tip her like a stripper, let her know I ain't joking
Fucking my habit
And my click the flyest
Like fuck my bitch, I want your bitch
Cuz your bitch the baddest
I eat it, you can keep it SB already had it
You know I ain't bragging but pussy my passion
She into that fashion
I stole her a bag
She got my name on her ass
See paper plate with no tag
She got packs of that cash
Like what's Poppington baby
If she want to cop some cock
I need monopoly baby

[Verse 2: Meatchi]

I'm so popular
Girl you know, Who I am

Open wide and let me stroke
Swimming in that water, let me drown, and I'm going to let you choke
That's a star 69
Got them bitches on my line

We switching up all the time
Pistol on my side when I need to go and take a ride
Cuz they want me dead cuz I'm all between they girls legs
That's his girl and I dont care
She want me and I'll be there
You mad cuz she cheating on you
You don't know that life ain't fair

Until we make that happen I'm on top of your girl
