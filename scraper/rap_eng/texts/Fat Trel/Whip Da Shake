(Intro)
Uh, uh, sellin' weight
VP, VA came from the Way
Fat Trel nigga, whip the shake
All this money, all this money

(Hook)
All this money that I make, grams in the shake
White tan, I ain't playin' always spraying up the place
Stuff it in the couch then my accountant call the rate
First I cop the house, then I whip the shake
Money mountain we ain't countin' fresh stake
Play wet with work who gotta wait
Red bottom, yesterday I gave her 8
Launder money just in case I gotta skate

(Verse 1: Fat Trel)
Okay I flip the trick and get that shit
I whip that shit and flip that shit
Driving up to Carolina I might find a different bitch
Might see me Vi
Meet me by the Appleby's
Money I forgot I had, bills truck, G wag
Stripper bitches but there ain't no ones in the trash bag
Choppers come from Rishmere, my shit looks like Baghdad
Slutty Boy, crazy baby tell me where the grams at
I just scraped the last batch, white and tan, pots and pans
Fly me in, try me man, you might wind up in the ambulance
Rolling by the avenue, bundles in the duffel bags

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
I whip the shit like a new car, flip that bitch like an acrobat
Everyday I see new money, new hoes, new clothes, like a laundromat
Catch me in the kitchen, whipping, going hard as titanium
Young Nigga Movement, on that Slutty Boy shit, going hard in the stadium
Get dope, take all this dough, get the work on like Claudio
Pistol whip him if he don't talk, you got a lot of shit like you gonna fall
Niggas talking shit, that's why they number 2
And I don't fuck a bitch, unless she fuck the crew
I will never change, you pussies can drop the Jazz
And I never trust a man, 'cuz any man can lie (True story)
I'm tired of all this bullshit, like Louie Wile
Gonna whip, I might be a while, got birds, they flew out

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Only available on the Trap Music: Squad Life 3 Mixtape)
Cook crack like I'm fuckin' dope
I used to have a lot, now I got plenty more
Fat Trel, that's my fat fuck
Tossin' ones like tossin' Michael Jordan first shots
This money that I make, got me lookin' great
All this trouble here got me pushin' base
Old virgin ass nigga better get the fuck away
Drop a glass cylinder, only way to bust a K
15 pounds, you can get a lot of fiends
Take yo hate away nigga, get a better deal
The lines up and down like the fuckin' letter N
You wanna make a hit, excuse me, Lord you gotta send
Make a man like a nigga dice em'
I ain't trouble (trouble) 'cuz all I do is 'buss em' (Buss em')
Try me I ain't no fist player
You better have protection if you come out this way

(Hook)

(Outro)
Yeah! Y'all know what it is!
V, A, B, P
YNM2, Whip the shake! Haha!
