[Juicy J]
Play me some pimpin'
Play me some motherfucking pimpin'

[Hook: Juicy J] (Excerpt from The First Episode by 8-Ball & MJG)
Pimp tight, what the fuck you wanna do?
See me with the street sweeper mowing down you and your crew
Gotta be ruthless, smackin' hoes toothless
Suckas gettin' dropped when I'm poppin' with the Glock bitch (x2)

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Freaky bitch in my six, talking bout eating dick
I'm gonn' shoot in her mouth, I bet you I don't miss
I'm gonna drop her off,You gon' give her a kiss
Listening to this song, nigga you gon be sick
All of these yellow diamonds, got you hoe niggas pissed
Catch me on coarse side, hundred thau on the grills
Yo bitch spend up all my kids, but she don't know where I live
Just slabbing my lap, baby girl you might need a beer
I got them choppers like clippers now don't make me split your wig
My homie just left the pen and he'll smoke you like cigs
And my pockets still big, I'm on the Instagram pic
Blowing dope with your bitch, that's just the way that it is
