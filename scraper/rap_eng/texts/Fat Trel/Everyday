Everyday, everyday, I do this shit like everyday
Everyday, (what?) Everyday, Everyday

[Hook : Fredo Santana]
Pourin' up a pint of lean, that's everyday
Stupid fresh, stupid clean, that's everyday
Racks bussin' out my jeans, that's everyday
Glock tat' with ?? stream, that's everyday
Hit the trap that's everyday, get it back that's everyday
Re-up that's everyday, buss' a brick that's everyday
That's everyday, everyday
That's everyday, everyday
That's everyday, I do this shit like everyday

[Verse 1 : Fat Trel]
Pourin' lean everyday
Fuckin' bitches everyway
Fat Trel, slutty boys
Glory Boys gettin' paid
Hunnid clip in every K
Shootin' shit like everyday
Gucci belts, Louis hats
Sorry I got Glory ways
When I'm in Chicago
No lackin' Ion' never play
When I'm in Miami
Drop the top cause I got glory ways
Fuck a bitch then tat' the name
I got slutty boy ways
When you see my face & hear my name
That's a crime wave
Smoking dope & swishers, Remy liquor, Glory boy ways
Bitches on my Insta never change, slutty boy ways
Buyin' a deuce of Sprite & pourin a 8, Glory boy ways
Marley with the liquor with the 8's, slutty boy ways

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Blood Money]
30 shot, Glock 40, Lebanon case
We be on the front, toting pistols want play
Do this everyday, do you best in everyway
Shooters in that escalade, pull up let the semis spray
Savage Squad, fuck them other niggas, we gon' make 'em pay
Ain't no feature free, if you ain't got it get the fuck away
I be with the shit, banana clip will levitate his face
I be with the shit, banana clip will levitate his face
My lawyer paid, Fredo got me we catchin' case
We hit the club buyin' bottles of Remy by the cases
It ain't no talking you can see this shit off in my face
Don't fuck with me bitch I be catchin' bodies everyday

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Gino Marley]
I be in them trap spots, that's everyday
Pocket full of dead faces, make 'em everyday
Plug got that off white, that's that 30 gray
I be chasin' cash while makin' cash, do that everyday
Pull up in a foreign car, pistols talk the way
Paid the block my younger days & nowadays I do the same
Spendin' cash & make it back, each & everyway
Bar bitch that's everyday, break a brick a couple way
Switchin' cars that's everyday, switchin' broads that's twice a day
Pull up in a empty car, loaded, drive them bricks away
Switchin' cars that's everyday, switchin' broads that's twice a day
Pull up in a empty car, loaded, that's everyday

[Hook]
