(Verse 1 Fat Trel)

Riding around in the spyder coupe no top like to tie the shoe
Yo Bitch want me to sign her boobs and I did after that she ride the crew
Everyday I count the cake
Hit the mall, I ball like Mike J
Neck, ring, Wrist like ice trays I can talk that shit like ice age
Tell the bitch eat the cake if the bitch fuck around she won't eat today
12hunna' bucks thats easy cake, Make the police do what Meatchi say
Shawty this hugo boss shit, you lost like that lacoste shit
Nigga Might really gon' call it quits, My bitches pay for all this
Slutty Boy shit nigga watch yo' bitch she a ho probably on the 3rd flo'
Suckin' dick, No digits still hit a quick lick, Need I remind that I'm bout that shit
Shit, first I peep out the whip, Pull the pistol out make em' get out the shit
Tear it all up nigga bounce that brick, Cause im shootin' everybody sittin' out this bitch
No bluffin', Rock like nufffin' Work in the pot, Tool in the oven, Money in the wall
Bet a bitch down the hall that'll turn a one pack into two no stuntin'
Yeah n' the money keep comin' Thrills, Bills, Bills runnin, Kill still, Ima youngn'
Fuck em' duck em' no bunnin, Bow

(Hook)

Low car, Let it go, Let it go, Let it go
Bitch say ima' animal, I'm all about my money roll
Shoota's from atalanta dropin' bombers like Geronimo
Watch I come from under with that thunder from a sunoco (2x)

(Verse 2 Fat Trel)

I went from wasting money down at the stadium, it flips like a gymnasium, Trappin' out
The palladium, my bad bitch name is Adrian, Adrian can smoke with me, Jack will break a coke wit' me
I told her I don't know no sleep, its no days off if you roll wit' me, fallin' she gon' catch me, he might
Catch her holdin' me, keep it G her father hate me cause he thinks she over me, plus I must've smoked
A P she like to keep a hold of me, my eyes are low I'm so low key, still keep that 4 0 on me
Rollin' you might lose your life, foolio' smoke ya' mama twice, put a nigga bangin' on a bucket of ice
Call the shit the sons of life, bitches ain't worried bout' funding right, they just want to have a little
Fun tonight, Shoota's' on deck, gun's right, if they take it to the left, ima make it to the right, take
A deep breath, turn off the lights, em' fo deck go fetch yo' wife, em' fo got my pen so right, green n' white had me up all Night, said it so wrong but it seemed so right, why the fuck they had to make it seem so bright, nigga's fall back we don't need yo' life, weigh it, wrap it, ship it, get it, twice

(Hook)
