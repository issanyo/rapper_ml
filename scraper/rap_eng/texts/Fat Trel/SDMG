First I pop me a blicky, I'm rollin' wit' Nikki
And I don't fuck with no niggas thats why I roll with the semi
Smoke my Swishers with liquor, papi don't fuck with the Remy
See fat papi in the Audi, he don't fuck with the Hemi

[Hook] (x2)
I'm talking plenty, sex, drugs, money and guns
If she let me fuck tonight, I might make me a son
Never satisfy that pussy, we fuck bitches for fun
Then make her bring that pussy back like the first of the month

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
It's the first of the month, and fat papi is Gleeshie
I got my forty on Meatchi, window down so you see me
Eatin' steak with the chicken, mixed with shrimp and linguine
You under me and honestly, I see why you wanna be me
But I can't fold for no old nigga, Papi pocket so bigga'
Yo' girlfriend my gold digga, she say I hate my old nigga
Take a flight, selling all white, no bag just big doe
He low key, he way low, my shit pop like crisco
30 shot clip thats drum roll, my fo' fifth say fuck a ho
Stadium I don't play wit' dem', like true where fuck my one's go
Hoes on my mind, I fuck hoes all the time, point my eye, at yo ho
She gon' go, yo ho mine, I can't lie she on my mind, my dick leave
And yo' ho cry, and it may seem that I don't lie, but I do and I
Don't know why, uh yeah, come with me on this plane way
I forgot yo' name babe, she answer like cancer, my birthday
On the same day, different body, same K but they say he died the same way
All I know he's gone, tell the police leave me alone, they follow me to my home
She swallow me till he gon', my price is cheap but if you like the shit
Everybody say I'mma sight to see, I just wanna get what's right for me
Pussy play I like to eat, love to smoke cause I like the weed
Got yo' main bitch wanna dyke with me, DC on padlock
Make a lot of money, got mad guap
They see me on TV, me and SB, we like Madlock
Stop the shop, drop tan blocks, my next stop the sandlot
Pick me up a duffel bag then kill his man if the plan flop
Stop the shop drop tan blocks, my next stop the sandlot
Pick me up a duffel bag, then kill his man if the plan flop

[Bridge + Hook]

[Bridge: Fat Trel]
Cause I see rainbows, I see clouds
I see kilograms, I see a pound
I want it all and I want it right now
And the president himself
Couldn't make me calm down
