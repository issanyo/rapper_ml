Lets get it

Rest in peace to my real niggas, in the field niggas
On sight drillers and drug dealers I deal with em
Wish I was still with them, smoking dope and pop pills with em
I never kill or die, when his momma cry I still feel him
I can't change over, drop top couple and a Range Rover
I can't help that I grew up with some insane soldiers
Murder death in my lifestyle, my momma pray for me cause my life wild
When I first touched 30 thousand, I was too high couldn't come down
Let me give you the rundown, hustle to sun up to sundown
Too many niggas dead and gone so I'm never ever putting my guns down
I seen some friends killing best friends, a lot of real shit that I regret seeing

I ride with my niggas, I die with my niggas. I'm dirty with 30's and semi's
A birdie is with me I'm nervous I'm swervin i pray n i hope lord forgive me
U bussin u hit me u must not forget to finish me im takin u away
Young niggas dont play in my city
That shit not okay in my city
I love all my niggas im wit it we did it we spend it the minute we get it
I love all my bitches i kiss it i lick it i hit it the minute im wit her
I love all my niggas im wit it we did it we spend it the minute we get it
I love all my bitches i kiss it i lick it i hit it the minute im wit her

The shooters is out at my grandmas house, I ain't been round this bitch in a minute
Police is lurking, these bitches is working, they servin they pussy im wit it
Chrissy just called me she told me she saw me, I told her come get me lets skurr (skurr)
Im coolin wit Ricky but then she come get me, I promise this sex in the city
Im counting these commas, im tootin these llamas, the drama I promise im with it
The roof
