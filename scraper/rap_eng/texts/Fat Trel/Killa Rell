[Intro]
Yeah, Killa Rell
Called Killa Rell, yeah
He been catchin' bodies like killer whales, yeah
Yeah, nigga shout out Killa Kell, yeah

[Chorus]
North East, some nigga named Killa Rell, yeah, uh
Catchin' bodies like killer whales, yeah, man
Shout out my nigga Killa Kell, yeah, yeah
Shout out Killa and Kell, yeah
North East nigga, get my grind on, get your shine on
Hope you got your pistol, nigga, mine on, get your mind blown

[Verse 1]
Sellin' coke, bitch, Moncler raincoat
All this colored money, bitch, it's rainbow
You can't name a place a nigga can't go
Glock got a switch, nigga, what the fuck I gotta aim for?
They say my money longer than some train smoke
We want all the murder, nigga, chain smoke
We can shoot lil' Shane at the same boat
When I was 7 years younger, I was trained to go
What's the fastest way to get a meal ticket?
Might just use some coke and go and deal with it
Over this money, I'll kill with it
Was with this shit before the rappin', bitch, I'm still with it
My lawyer called me, say I got a court date
I'ma walk in that bitch in some North Face
Plus I smell like pack and I'm for sure late
You want a tail with your slippers, nigga, horseplay
You know I care about the money, stop playin'
Had a quarter ticket on me when I came in
Had a couple bitches with me that ain't take dick
Nigga flewed off, they don't say shit, yeah

[Chorus]
North East, some nigga named Killa Rell, yeah, uh
Catchin' bodies like killer whales, yeah, man
Shout out my nigga Killa Kell, yeah, yeah
Shout out Killa and Kell, yeah
North East nigga, get my grind on, get your shine on
Hope you got your pistol, nigga, mine on, get your mind blown

[Verse 2]
I'm a North East nigga, I ain't changin'
In the cold, I'm on Bentley Road, chasin'
I remember I had pounds in the basement
Grandma used to catch me out but I ain't say shit
I'ma go to school, I would sell it all
Coke in my sock, weed in my drawers
Buy ecstasy, them freaky bitches gon' purchase it all
I'm duckin' metal detectors, ain't runnin' from the law
Yeah, back on sixteenth for the ice down
Ten years later, I'm on spikes now
Three diamond rings, bitch, bite down
She gon' come and fuck a nigga right now
Say it with your chest, lil' nigga, pipe down
And if you see the red and blue, then cut your lights down
I got the best, bitch, and I can roll it right now
And matter fact, bitch, you know I'm rollin' right now
North East nigga, where the funds at?
Feds press us out, where the guns at?
Pretty stripper bitches, where the ones at?
All you niggas gangsters, where my sons at?
