I go crazy with my..
Finest bitch
Where you find this bitch
Thats my finest bitch
Any sign of the police nigga
Ay, gang

[Hook]
All that money bring to finer things
All the necklaces, all the diamond rings
I go crazy with my finest bitch
Buy her Gucci, buy her Louis, that designer shit
Money in and out the mansion like the bunny ran
If polices pull us over, stuff our underpants
Got the act and make it rain, i'm the thunder man
Call my brother and we keep that shit one hundred man

[Verse: 1]
Just another day, my block no flee
Police rolled up like five six deep nigga
Hands on the wall, nigga spread yo feet nigga
Bang bang bang, Skeet skeet skeet
Big fall, all fall deep in the jeep
Night time switch it up, choppa game on fleek
Nigga you ain't never here, never watch my sleep nigga
Got the riches runnin in by the flea nigga
Flip a pack, send it back last week nigga
No feast 16, free street nigga
Pent house say BBC nigga
Double back, fuck that delete nigga
You try, you die, you weak nigga
No 945 could see nigga
Fuck a beat, i was raised in the street nigga
Young nigga got paid in the street nigga
I can remember just back in the day
I was a youngin just packin the tray
Walk with my bitch and we hop on the train
Toting the glick, cause i walk with a dane
Police is hawkin, remember my name
We do no talkin, no coughin up names
If you get hit with this snitch and this pendant
We gon go crazy like fuck the beginnin

[Hook]
All that money bring to finer things
All the necklaces, all the diamond rings
I go crazy with my finest bitch
Buy her Gucci, buy her Louis, that designer shit
Money in and out the mansion like the bunny ran
If polices pull us over, stuff our underpants
Got the act and make it rain, i'm the thunder man
Call my brother and we keep that shit one hundred man

[Verse: 2}
Nigga just another day, we the slutty boy gang
Got phone blowing up, pussy pullin on my chain
Nigga word to the dead who ain't ever said names
She gon fuck with us for the money and the fame
Black Maybach with the strap switch lanes
All the hoes i fuck, i could never be a lame
Double mg, gettin head on the plane
I remember when i used to fuck hoes on the train
Black four fifth, thats an S.I.G
Shoot a nigga in the face, no case I.D
Hit em in the shit, real swift i leave
Nigga we ain't ever low, so come try me
Blue face hundreds, and the pig fake figures
And my bitch ain't fuckin if you niggas ain't trigga
Beef in the streets, man i know you ain't with it
I shoot a nigga dead, nigga you ain't ever did it
Bitch real bad, nigga you ain't ever hit it
You was quiet in the classroom and i ain't pay attention
Big four, all 33, no pimpin
Two hoes in the kitchen, nigga im Jack Tripper
Bitch so bad nigga you ain't ever hit it
You was quiet in the classroom and i ain't pay attention
Big four, all 33, no pimpin
Two hoes in the kitchen, nigga im Jack Tripper
