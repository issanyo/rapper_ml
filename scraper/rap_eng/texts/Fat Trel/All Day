She got a number one? Fuck it, I'm the runner up
I'm never done, I ain't even got enough
She always wanna fuck when she see me rollin' up
And she the one, she the shit, she know enough
I count them doubles all day-ay
I need a break but we been fuckin' all day-ay
My birthday, she bought me a AK-ay
Baby won't you come my way-ay, my way-ay

[Verse 1]
And my lil' shawty don't play-ay
She suck the dick, she hit the J-ay
She with the shits and AK-ays
A nigga bullshit it's mayday-ay
I gotta keep a gun just to try to stay alive
It's me and Blanca rollin' and he totin' the .45
I came back to sell the game, make a hater realize
I'm at the finish line and I need you to give me mine
I been hustlin' all day-ay
I put you on the front pa-age
You makin' minimum wa-age
And she got criminal wa-ays

All I think about is gettin' la-aid
Gettin' head, gettin' bread, gettin' pa-aid

This money, you gon' drown and if not you better swim
He talkin' to police so I cannot fuck with him
But I got what you need, make you smoke without a stem
She got some double D's, I think I can fuck with them
She fuckin' me but you know after that she fuckin' him
She got some double D's, I think I can fuck with them
