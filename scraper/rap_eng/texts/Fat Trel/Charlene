[Intro: Fat Trel]
They ain't never gonna understand this one right here
Ricky
So low

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
If you leavin' me, that mean you don't believe in me
I just need to be where all the liquor, weed and lean in me
While you was sleepin' and dreamin', I was breathing with fiends
You kept your legs open, I kept my dick in between
With my gun by my side, I be drunk when I drive
I'm scorin like I'm Jordan, when I'm performin' I'm high
I be sleep when I fly, then my driver arrive
Then you handin me drugs, now I think I'm in love
Now I be with them thugs, drinkin' liquor with strippers
[?] I'm poppin pills while paparazzi takin' pictures
A lotta bright lights, drunk white dykes
Long nights in the studio with stupid hoes
Groupie hoes, fuck me with they eyes closed
Just hopin' and wishin' for a baby and riches
And I be with the richest, and he is Ricky Hil
Doing drugs, and we all know drugs kill

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
When I'm high (when I'm high)
When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
In my zone (in my zone)
Nothing really matters
I got pills (I got weight)
I got weed (outta state)
Whatchu need

Will you ever be around when I start to come down?
Will you ever be around?
When I come down, are you gonna be around?
Are you gonna be around
When I come down?

[Verse 2: Ricky Hil]
If you're leaving, I'd like to know
Thought I met you a life ago
A face like you, just a wife ago
She don't like me though, she just fuck me slow
You don't gotta die the same time as me
You don't have to take as many as me
I sip yellow syrup when I smoke purple haze
Right now [?] behind my face
And you ain't like me, you just in a phase
I'm up right now, don't give a fuck if she stays
What do you want, you don't get it back
I thought you knew that
So what do you need, I don't have that
I thought you knew that
Ho
And everything I made, I done made back
I shouldn't do that

[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
When I'm high (when I'm high)
When I'm gone (when I'm gone)
In my zone (in my zone)
Nothing really matters
I got pills (I got weight)
I got weed (outta state)
Whatchu need

Will you ever be around when I start to come down?
Will you ever be around?
When I come down, are you gonna be around?
Are you gonna be around
When I come down?
