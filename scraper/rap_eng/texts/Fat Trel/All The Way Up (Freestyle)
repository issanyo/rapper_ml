[Verse 1: Tate Kobang]
His and hers Versaces ‘cause I can afford ‘em
All my children is my angels so I can’t abort ‘em
They say Tate Ko run the city so they can’t extort him
And please don’t ask me ‘bout my verses ‘cause you can’t afford ‘em
Everything been looking up, I call it heaven’s graces
They been knew I run it, they just wanted confirmation
Got a million in my sight, that shit’s so close, I taste it
If gettin’ on mean they gon’ love me, I don’t want to make it
Fuck ‘em, I love it better when they work against me
I fuck a bitch for several hours when that perc up in me
Henny and Red Bull, demons, got a bed full
Hits, I got a hand full, guns, I got a crib full
Sleeping on the road like what the fuck I got a bed for?
The lord is on my side so what the fuck should I be scared for?
Speak no evil, how is she gon’ lead the people
Desert Eagle speaking, it will leave you see-through
Always been around the rock, I feel like Beanie Sigel
Claiming I’m a one hitter, I don’t need a sequel
Nigga’s flow is heroin like I don’t needs a needle
Give a fuck about how they feel because I’m all the way up

[Hook: Tate Kobang]
I’m all the way up
That lean got it hard for me to stay up
But I’m all the way up
Pussy nigga I’m all the way up
I'm all the way up
That lean got it hard to stay up
But I’m all the way up
I’m all the way up

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
I’m all the way up
I’m in Baltimore coolin’ with a white guy
On the block I got the heat nigga, white hot
I’m just fanning in a mansion, that’s a nice spot
Rolex, nice watch, time, I get mine, ha
Everything they said I am I am probably not
I’m in the kitchen killin’ rats like this a Chinese spot
And I be posted in the back where you can find the rock
Dirty bitches, pussy burning, plus it’s kind of hot
Dynamite, got them crack heads smoking china white
Out of sight, out of mind, or it’s fed time
I’m in the stu, I’m killing shit like it’s a dead line
Car full of dead black males, red the headlight
Plenty fine, got them bitches singing [?]
And all them pussy niggas hatin’, tell ‘em give me mine
All them bitches never loved us, tell ‘em make a line
You just another side bitch, play the sideline
Fine timing, plus I can read the guidelines
Bitches on my Jimmy Choo, I do the wonton
And you can get some Fendi boots if you can find mine
Chanel purse but don’t ask me what the belt worth
Body dropping, blood mix well with the dirt
Try to stop it nigga, just gon’ get your feelings hurt
Or layin’ with them niggas, just gon’ put you in a hearse
And since that’s where you wanna be just let me take a leak

[Outro: Fat Trel]
Hold up, me take a pee
Piss on your body nigga
Fuck you and your great grandma
And I mean that
I mean that shit nigga
