[Intro: Fat Trel]
Ricky Hill, Slickville, I'm the illest here

[Chorus: Fat Trel & Ricky Hil]
My new bitch is crawlin' on all fours (crawlin' on all fours)
Poppin' Tylenol 4's (and poppin' Tylenol 4's)
These bitches say they all for us (bitches say they all for us)
But in the end they all whores (but in the end they all whores)
Now I'm ridin' suicide doors (ridin' suicide doors)
Smokin' tree with my liquor (smokin' tree with my liquor)
Just finished fuckin', woke up and wanted for more (woke up and wanted for more)
And when I park, I make the bitch open the door (bitch open the door)

[Verse 1: Fat Trel]
Look, I like the lights real low with a dyke ho
Smoke big dope, she's psycho
See, the tire on flat, window bust out
Cut it out, you ain't fuckin' with the right hoes
Hit it from the back, mix Sprite with the Act
So fat, I be puttin' on a micro
Say she tryna fuck, I just roll the window up
Bitch thought I was whipping with the nitro
Head good but the pussy real slight though
You become a habit for the night though
Smokin' on the weed, ain't suckin' no dick
One trick then the bitch is on white hoes
I'm rich so I make her go crazy
And plus when I fuck her she pay me
You gotta be kiddin', her pussy is
Just like a lottery ticket, I'm lazy
Drinkin' and smokin', these pistols I'm totin'
I had your ass sleep on the pavement
Fuck her for three hours, I shower
I'm out and about on the daily
My momma be trippin', my chopper be kicking
I know she regret that she made me
I trap with the thugs, just doin' my drugs
And these are the things that I love

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
I miss when she screaming she need me
I wait till she sleep and I'm leaving
Bendin' her over, I'm tossing it up
When I fuck it, I make it look easy
Smokin' and drinkin', the dope with the lean
But still I could fuck up the scene
Shoot with no blinkin', the fuck was you thinkin?
A nickle'll kiss with a beam
On mollies, I feel like a fiend
On Fridays, I pop me a bean
I got it, my pockets are collared in cottage
I promise to scream "cheese"
I bet I could make her believe
Fly her and the bitch to Belize
She's trippin' me out, kicking her out
She tryna come figure me out
I show her the gang, she come from a drought
We sleep in the trap in her house
Cause he do no faking, don't get me mistaken
The paper is what I'm about
I show her the gang, she come from a drought
We sleep in the trap in her house
Cause he do no faking, don't get me mistaken
The pussy is what I'm about, muah

[Hook]
