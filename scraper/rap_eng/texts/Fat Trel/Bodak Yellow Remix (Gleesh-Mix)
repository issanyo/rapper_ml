Fat Trel

[Verse 1 : Fat Trel]
Stupid nigga what i done to you except trap in front of you
Every time i come around you just acting uncomfortable
Too legit this new designer clip this bitch a point and shoot
My young niggas in the trenches come get some embalming fluid
Backwood, she sit front em J's take the fun away
I'm still fresh up outta jail how i can't keep my gun away
While i waited on my sentence i would smoke a ton a day
Obviously,back up in these streets it time to come and play
I was vibin' to the beat in the kitchen with the key
Went straight to the radio that 95 to 93
Everybody turnin' up i think its time i got a piece
If you think about running up this pump will knock you off your feet
Hands down,i'm thee man now you understand now?
I can't tell my soldier stand down he want that man down
Went to piss for my P.O today i'm on them xans now
If she think about violating this choppa make a bad sound
Woah, i get the work then i roll i get it fresh off the boat
I did it all on my own,pull up and get you a bong
Pull up too late then i'm gone,I might just do me a song
You should just leave me alone, no you should just leave me alone
I don't know why she keep stalking or calling my phone
I pick up and tell her i'm gone , they oppin' she working for police
Just keepin' it G what nigga hotter than me?
I promise i got it for cheap, just keep it discreet eat the Patek the Phillippe
I promise i got it i'm shoppin' for profit,you shoulda just got it from me
I cannot play with my potna he did me a solid i'm puttin' it back on the street

[Chorus : Cardi B]
Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves
