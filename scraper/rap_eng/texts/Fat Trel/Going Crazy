[Intro]
We're walking in the air
Floating in the sky
Floating in the air
We're walking in the air
We're floating in the moonlight sky
The people far below are sleeping as we fly!

[Verse 1]
Flow, flow, flow
Aye, I see murder, I see murder
Murder, murder all around (all around)
I be fucking me another nigga bitch
Whipping me another nigga brick
Grab the piece from my waist like hol'
Tell a pussy nigga move a little slow
I'mma keep the drugs and I'mma keep the guns
But the bitches here, the bitches gotta go!
Checking nigga I remember being'
Laying pussy niggas down on the floor
It was robbing niggas, it was robbing bitches
It's too tremendous, I know (I know)
But the police, they too slow (I know)
Is even that or they just don't know, know!
It was off then and no Spalding
It was balling out of control (control)
If you ask about me, they know (they know!)
I was mixed killer and ho
I be out of town, and I be shutting down
A lot of places rappers can't go!
When they see me nigga, they know!
SB we keep a ho (a ho)
She Californiacatin', California money making!
