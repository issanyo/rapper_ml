[Verse1]
Once again i fell in love i kill the dog
Am savage my habits just running
Around with some bad bitch
I went pass it went for nigga who never have bitch
And am mad with her but the other nigga so sorry
Once again i fell in love i kill the dog
Am savage my habits just running
Around with some bad bitch
I went pass it went for nigga who never have bitch
And am mad with her but the other nigga so sorry
Watch i fuck up the mall way
Ain't no tellin i doging hope yâ€™all get it
The song with it no small fish
I was riding low i was smoking dope
I was fucking hoes i was being good
No comoncery no money rush
I was making cakes back in 08
I was real straight i was face to face
When they introduce to that murder gang
I was fist to fist i was cup to cup i was line them up
Some black nigga with some white bag designer doll

[Chorus]
Once again i fell in love and i kill the dog
Am savage my habits just running
Around with some bad bitch
I went pass it went for nigga who never have bitch
And am mad with her but the other nigga so sorry
Once again i fell in love i kill the dog
Am savage my habits just running
Around with some bad bitch
I went pass it went for nigga who never have bitch
And am mad with her but the other nigga so sorry

[Verse2]
Watch i go fuck up the club with her
Fuck romance no love with her
Just thugs with us no crps with us
No bloods with us i was riding hot with mah forty five
While i molly role hit the pool party i was poppin bottles
All kind a hoes i was hit list back in 06
With the standard clips i was face to face when they kill
Whoop with that bulshit i was fist to fist
I was cuff to cuff i would line them up
With the slutty boy from DC fucking all the sluts

[Chorus]
Once again i fell in love i kill the thug
Am savage my habits just running
Around with some bad bitch
I went pass it went for nigga who never have bitch
And am mad with her but the other nigga so sorry
Once again i fell in love i kill the thug
Am savage my habits just running
Around with some bad bitch
I went pass it went for nigga who never have bitch
And am mad with her but the other nigga so sorry

[Verse3]
Watch i go fuck up the club with her
Fuck romance no love with her
Just thugs with us no crps with us
No bloods with us i was fucking hoes
I was eating good no commentary no money roll
I was making cake back in 08 i was real straight
I was face to face when they kill
Whoop with that [?]
Some black nigga with some white bag designer doll
Some black nigga with some white bag designer doll
