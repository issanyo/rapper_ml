Headlocked in this Hollywood armpit
Pushed along by ego driven bullshit
Dreaming of another place where I can ease my mind
The weather's always perfect here but I don't see the sunshine
And I'm not blind

I've been chasing that old story: rags to riches
Forgetting I've had riches to begin with
I was a good man in my good ol' days
But now it seems them good old days are done
The less I see my family, the more of a fucking scumbag I become

Before I asked you for your name
I would probably ask you if you had cocaine
The fuck I care about your life; I only care about mine
You ain't no potential wife; I'll only see you one time
So let's get high

I've been fucking with too many different bitches
Calling women bitches to begin with
I was a good man in my good ol' days
But now it seems them good old days are done
The less I see my family, the more of a fucking scumbag I become

[Break]

My life ain't over, not just yet
But it's much too late for me to not regret
The days and nights I've wasted, how I've spent my borrowed time
I wasn't raised to be so empty, selfish and unkind
I don't know why

If I knew God I'd ask him for forgiveness
And why he even put me here to begin with
I was a good man in my good ol' days
But now it seems them good old days are done
The less I see my family, the more of a fucking scumbag I become
