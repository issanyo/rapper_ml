[Hook]

I roll wit stoners an a bunch off
Drugs
I buy my weed of a bunch off
A bunch of thugs
I smoke the pot until I get caught
When I'm out of tokes it leaves
Me distraught
Oh my eyes are blood shot
My eyes are blood shot
My eyes are blood shot!

[Verse 1]

Now, if you only started smokin'
Recently
Yo brain must feel like it's changin'
Frequency
Of course Mary Jane has the decency
To make you feel like you can fly!
Don't trip man, your just high!
Brains rotten so you feel like you
Can die!
Catch you & yo crew actin' like some
Sort of butterfly
You can't deny, that when you buy
And take your first try
You feel like yo in the sky!
Say goodbye to ya problems
Marijuana can solve em'
I've done so much wrong
That when I take a hit from the bong
It lasts so muthafuckin' long!

[Hook]

I roll wit stoners an a bunch off
Drugs
I buy my weed of a bunch off
A bunch of thugs
I smoke the pot until I get caught
When I'm out of tokes it leaves
Me distraught
Oh my eyes are blood shot
My eyes are blood shot
My eyes are blood shot!

[Verse 2]

I can't deny the side effects are
Kickin' in
I've been smokin' for so long
Breakin' every single bong I've had
Ugh psychotic that's very bad
Watcha writing on ya pad
Hopefully you go broke
Hopefully I don't catch a stoke
From every single toke
Tie my neck wit this rope and let it hang!
All the sudden I see Senyor Chang
He tells me to let him in
Oh shit he just punched me in my shin!
I should just let him win!
