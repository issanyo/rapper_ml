[Hook]
You're not good enough to hurt me so bad
Or underestimated what we had
You're not true enough to have me just lie
In bed all day wondering why

[Verse 1]
I should really be like, good riddance
You disloyal and this ain't the first instance
I know we said since this is long distance
That when we were apart we would just live separate existences
Keep secrets don't slip and get caught
But I guess I love you more than I initially thought
When I see you on the weekend yo it's like you my wife
Then you fucking dudes from Tinder on that Monday night
And I ain't saying I'm monogamous, broke a lot of promises
But at this point, I'mma just tap out
We had a lot of good times, but the future's wide open
And I got a new route, I got to map out
Arruvederci, I ain't saying I won't miss you
But I'm headed to the sea to check out how these other fish do
Maybe they won't talk to me like I was 10
Or have sex with my fucking friends

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That first verse was kinda mean
But the truth hurts, and sometimes it is obscene
I'm just a human being, I'm not emotionless
I wish I wasn't having so much trouble trying to cope with this
I feel like you don't deserve my tears
And you've been getting on my last nerve for years
But there's something in your eye that makes me miss you even still
That makes me want to call you and find out when we can chill
I always thought that maybe we were soulmates
Probably cause we have a lot of similar traits
See, I'm fucked up, and you're fucked up
We could raise kids together make sure they're all fucked up but
Alas, those thoughts are all in the past
The last straw made the camel's head crash into his ass
Peace, I wish you nothing but the best
I mean that for real, God bless

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look, you'll probably never hear this song
But if you do you know God damn well it's about you
And you gotta understand I don't write songs to be mean
I'm just telling the truth
Question your morality
Question your fucking morality
