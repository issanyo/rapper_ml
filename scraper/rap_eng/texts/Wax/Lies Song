[Intro: Spose]
I'd never lie to you, there's no drums in this song

[Verse 1: Spose]
I'll spit my verses all in Spanish, I was born in Kansas
I'm the richest person on the planet
I would never get a tattoo
I'd never feed my daughter fast food
("Any sauces with that?" "Uh, can I get three barbecue?")
Bobby Flay never wrote a recipe
Michelle Obama won't stop sexting me
Fat people look awesome in Spandex
Nobody's ever got killed by Aaron Hernandez
2Pac's alive, Smurfs are black
Witches are real, the Earth is flat
X: that's the number five in Roman numerals
I've never used Twitter at a relative's funeral
My car has a retracting top, I'm always wearing matching socks
Janet Jackson's dead, but Michael Jackson's not
To take it further, there has never been a rape or murder in the state of Florida
And my basement doesn't look like it's an episode of Hoarders
I have never seen Dora The Explorer
I got all the deaf people listenin'
Augusta is the capital of Michigan
But I would never lie to you

[Hook: Spose]
I would never lie, lie, lie
Betty White is not old, ice is not cold
And I would never lie, lie, lie (This is not the hook)
I never kill it in the booth, politicians tell the truth
And I would never lie, lie, lie
I've never watched porn, the sun is not warm
And I would never lie, lie, lie
I'd never lie to you

[Verse 2: Wax]
Your wildest dreams are all easily attainable
And oil based infrastructure's endlessly sustainable
The people in charge are all anti-war
The economy's run by the disenfranchised poor
In high school the pants I wore were skin tight
A Mogwai is unaffected if you feed it after midnight
The best way to reach me is to send a Facebook invite
Not a single rhyme that I've written's ever been tight
I'm not a know-it-all, I always follow protocol
Never broke a law, last night I fucked Oprah raw
I don't enjoy red wine or cold Stella
Next year, I'm booked to headline at Coachella
I just paid off all my credit cards and student loans
Atop the Hollywood Hills, I own two big homes
Voting is important
It's really hard to find a strip club in Portland

[Hook: Spose]
I would never lie, lie, lie
Betty White is not old, ice is not cold
And I would never lie, lie, lie (This is not the hook)
I never kill it in the booth, politicians tell the truth
And I would never lie, lie, lie
I've never watched porn, the sun is not warm
And I would never lie, lie, lie
I'd never lie to you

[Verse 3: Spose]
Bentley logos on my car's exterior
Honey Nut Cheerios, that is not a cereal
Unicorn skin is my coat's material
It's safe to be a gay Jew in Syria
My name is not Spose, I am not dope
My bedroom floor is not covered with clothes
Your YouTube comments might stop me
I don't like iced coffee
You know my abs are solid
I never skipped a class in college
I didn't drop out of college just to sign a record deal
Just to get dropped ten months later, I'm known for my sex appeal
I hate when they're paying me, I could never make a beat
Bill Cosby: he doesn't seem rapisty
I'm a six-foot-five girl clearly
The Cubs always win the World Series
I won't eat it if that's bacon, I'm into castration
I hate big titties and ass shakin'
And when I'm late for my meeting and I get a speeding ticket
I'm always pumped like a gas station
My fans have never helped me
I've never took a selfie
Cigarettes are healthy
And you don't look like a dick with your sunglasses on inside
I would never lie to you

[Hook: Spose]
I would never lie, lie, lie
Betty White is not old, ice is not cold
And I would never lie, lie, lie (This is not the hook)
I never kill it in the booth, politicians tell the truth
And I would never lie, lie, lie
I've never watched porn, the sun is not warm
And I would never lie, lie, lie
I'd never lie to you

Shane Reis doesn't rap on this song

[Verse 4: Shane Reis]
I give a fuck about a top ten, I'm not raw
These guys have a lot of fans and most of them are not friends
I'm public with my personal
It doesn't bother me when people rhyme "hearse" with "verse" and then act versatile
I don't like being topped off, I hate convertibles
I'm comfortable everywhere I go, I'm not nervous still
I hate painkillers, I buy 'em all the time cause I can afford 'em and take 'em daily cause I don't know what's important
I don't smoke too many cigarettes
I don't think about not smoking while smoking, and keep smoking
I don't love John Mayer
I care if you like what I like
And I know that life is beyond fair
Oh yeah
I don't feel like this is our year
I won't but they will like a car steered
I'm so lazy
I waited to grow up, I have zero babies
I took handouts all of my life, I'm so shady
I love drama
My in-laws aren't from Haiti
They aren't from Haiti
I never wanted it
I never believed that I was the best, even when all of these other people were flaunting it
I go to dog parks with the leash on a leopard
It's not a guarantee putting me on the record
I never sat at Whole Foods while Sarah ate a salad
And I believe being profitable equals talent

[Hook: Spose]
I would never lie, lie, lie
Betty White is not old, ice is not cold
And I would never lie, lie, lie (This is not the hook)
I never kill it in the booth, politicians tell the truth
And I would never lie, lie, lie
I've never watched porn, the sun is not warm
And I would never lie, lie, lie
I'd never lie to you

[Interlude: Spose]
There's no guitar in this song
I've never put guitar in a song
Guitar's wack

[Bridge: KGFREEZE & Dave Gutter]
Could you even imagine if I told you the truth?
Reality is gone, I'm just gonna front, I'm just gonna lie, lie, lie
Could you even imagine if I told you the truth?
Reality is gone, I'm just gonna front, I'm just gonna lie, lie, lie
The truth hurts
