(First verse)
Yeah
Big Wax, EOM
Check it out, check it out yo
If you can’t feel this, then you must be numb
And if you think we don’t run LA, then you must be dumb, CHECK IT
I pull up to the club in a stretched Cadillac, with a hot tub in the back jumped out
And I smacked all the bouncers, still wearing swimming trunks
Owner comes down and he’s like let him in punks!
Paparazzi sitting on fences
Trying to snap pics and I’m spitting on lenses
Act in like an ignorant punk
Hollywood swingin’, belligerent drunk

[Hook]
It’s a pity most clubs in the city can’t (HANDLE US)
Cause we the baddest motherfuckers in (LOS ANGELES)
And every time that we roll out people hold out they arms to smack (HANDS WITH US)
Cause we the baddest motherfuckers in (LOS ANGELES)

(Second verse)
Yo
Stumbled inside of the upper-class hip spot
Soaking wet shorts and some sucker ass flip flops
We don’t fit in but we gon’ get in
Front of the line even with no himmin (?) but
That’s rare that it happens our entourage looks like the Miss America pageant
All races, all creeds, even got a set of triplets from Belize
My whole crew be truly unruly
Ain’t nothing that we do don’t ever run smoothly
My homie that’s already being that guy
Puked on the floor, fell down, got a black eye
‘Who the hell was that?!’ said the poor janitor
I said ‘oh, him, that’s just my tour manager’
We stomp fools like an elephant herd
And we don’t go apeshit
We go elephant turd, that’s my word!

[Hook]
It’s a pity most clubs in the city can't (HANDLE US)
Cause we the baddest motherfuckers in (LOS ANGELES)
And everytime that we roll out people hold out they arms to smack (HANDS WITH US)
Cause we the baddest motherfuckers in (LOS ANGELES)

(Third verse)
We got there late so our booth had been given out
Then to get it back they had to kick Jeremy Pithen out
Sorry, Arrey, get back in your Ferrari and drive your sorry ass to another party
We in the booth sippin’ paps like usual
And the cocktail waitress is fucking beautiful
Drunk perv, thoughts of a sleazebag
Every time she touched me I’m stiff like freeze tag
She gon’ be mad when she give us the tab
Cause we already spent every cent we had
You think stretched Cadillacs run cheap these days?
We ain’t rich, that’s just how we behave
Poof, run out of the bar out of nowhere
As far as that club, that’s the last time we go there
My whole team stays sloppy and bunny
At the strip club tippin’ with monopoly money, dunny!

[Hook] (2X)
It’s a pity most clubs in the city can't (HANDLE US)
Cause we the baddest motherfuckers in (LOS ANGELES)
And every time that we roll out people hold out they arms to smack (HANDS WITH US)
Cause we the baddest motherfuckers in (LOS ANGELES)

(Outro)
Go shawty, it’s your birthday
So many trees you thought that it was Earth day
Ma man E got soul like surf day
My name Wax and the mic’s with the wordplay, heard me?!
