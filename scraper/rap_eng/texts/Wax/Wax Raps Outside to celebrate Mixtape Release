Rap's most handsome
Wax, I'm so random
British soccer riot, I'm the last bloke standing
Rap flows expand my mind
My rhymes built from the game of life like the dude who owns Hasbro's mansion
I do it all so a lot of people get confused
You could say I wear many hats like Hasidic jews
I do comedy, act, rhyme, and the beat
I could make your girlfriend laugh, cry, dance, and skeet
I'm a unique fucking snowflake, a unicorn
One of the most non-uniform humans born
You've been warned
Several shots fired like I'm doing porn
Might fuck around, learn to play the flugelhorn
Like silk comes out of a worm
People of my ilk come from powerful sperm
The competition get [?] and burned
Then I sniff up the spilt powder from out of the urn
Yo
I'm a behemoth
A mammoth
You squeamish
And famished
My words drive the chicas bananas
I'm going hard until 2023 then I vanish
To a beach in Havana where I will frequent cabanas
Old creepy drunk in the corner eating a sandwich
Tryna holler at women but I don't speak any Spanish
Probably spend my last days on tequila and Xanax
Til they find me in an alleyway, teethless and pantless
That said, I'm still a boss for the humble
Like the clue for Jesus on a crossword puzzle
You should ask your dog for his muzzle
And stop yapping
Stop rapping 'cause you awkwardly struggle
You malarkey
You might find it kind of snarky
But I'll avant-garde-ly serve you line by line a la Cartly
You try hard and I say fuck it and chill
With Pacifico my bucket is filled
Cut to the grill
