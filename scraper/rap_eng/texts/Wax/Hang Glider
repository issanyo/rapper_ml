[Verse 1]
I'm a hang glider
Glidin' with the will of the wind
A hang glider rider
Landing point to be determined

I've never really hung glided before but I'd imagine
That when you're up in the sky you ain't thinkin' 'bout crashin'

[Verse 2]
I'm nothing like a seagull
Seagulls were intended to fly
The thing about people
We always find a way to get high

Would you rather be flyin' or would you rather keep standin'
Wait forever to die or have a fast crash landin'

[Bridge]
That plane sound
Came at just the right time
I jam with nature
I jam with the cityscapes

[Verse 3]
To be a hang glider
First you gotta jump off a cliff
The next thing you gotta do is just
Hold on tight while you drift

There ain't no engines and there ain't no captain
There's no controllin' the wind you never know what might happen

[Verse 4]
The world gets quiet
When you hang glidin' around
There's no anxiety
You left your bullshit back on the ground

Strap me in to that apparatus
And watch me fly and possibly drown

I've never really hung glided before but I'd imagine
That when you're up in the sky it ain't nothin' but rock'n'roll baby
And you ain't never comin' down
