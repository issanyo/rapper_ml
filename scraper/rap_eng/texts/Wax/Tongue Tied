I can't get over the softness of your skin
Your body and voice got me lost in sin
You say you love it when I pull your hair and I just can't let go of it
Kiss like bliss when you bite my lower lip
This ain't love, but this is more than lust
Because lust gets boisterous
And you be at a low volume
Every time I hear you moaning
And it seems when we're alone
Everyone else in the world died
Just me by my girl's side
Student to a teacher
Self-indulge the kind of thoughts of a tweaker
Little bit of wine and a little bit of reefer
D'angelo "Voodoo" out the speaker

You ask me questions but I can't give you no answer
Cause you got me tongue tied
When you ask me to be your man
You're kinda on the young side
And I know that you're probably gonna be my cross to bare
When we're alone, I don't wanna be nowhere else
But I've been through some shit before, so I know gotta be by myself
And you're kinda new to the game of pain
So I know I probably kinda lost you there (Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo!)

I can still smell your shampoo on my short sleeve
No one else around. I'm Adam and you're Eve!
Apple cores everywhere
Sex in the devil's lair
Comfortable in hell. Marry me. We can settle there
For eternity. The kind of man that you want I can learn to be
Your pretty face charred up to the first degree
I can't sleep cause the bed keeps burning me
And when we fuck it will feel like my dick has thorns
When you get pregnant the kids have horns
Tell Jesus
I'll kiss you till the day that hell freezes
