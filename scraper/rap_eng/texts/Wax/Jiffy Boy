The jiffy boy is on
Hurry up, he needs a hammer
Try to knock his head around
Give a hoot and he'll hit it harder
I can make a bunch of stuff fly
I can do a lot for my size

All and all I'm crazy in the head
I'm crazy in the end

I can get dislocated (don't try it)
If it hurts, I'll hit it harder

All and all I'm crazy in the head
I'm crazy in the end
I'm crazy don't forget

The jiffy boy went down
Hurry up he needs a doctor
Take the hammer from his head
Take the hammer from his hand
Take the hammer or he won't be 'round
Much longer
