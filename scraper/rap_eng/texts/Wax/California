Joe Sib:
I'm gonna move to Southern California
Got me a ride
And a reason to ignore you
Got me a radio
Ain't got no speakers
Ain't much use
So im leaving it
Leaving it for you
I'm leaving it for you

Could be by for you

Gotta find a room
And im running out of money
Staying out late
But I gotta get up early

Why did I move to Southern California?
Smile gets so blue
Someone shoulda warned you
They shoulda warned you

Could be by by
Could be by for you

Why did I move? (Southern California)
Why did I move? (Southern California Southern California)
Why did I move? (Southern California Southern California
Southern California Southern California)

Why did I move to Southern California?
