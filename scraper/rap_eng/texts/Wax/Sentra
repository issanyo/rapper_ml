[Intro]

[Hook]
Not in the Bentley, not in the Rose, now
Not in the Range, not even a Volvo
Not in the Beamer, not in the Benz, nah
Everybody wanna ride in Sentra
( up in the Sentra, up in the Sentra)

[Verse]
King of the road is what they anoint me
Cause I easily get from point A to point B
If Point B's close, I'ma hop on my bike
But I'ma take my Sentra if the shit is a hike
Ayo, my car's awesome
My phone goes to the speaker when I'm talking
Plus I got that 8 inch AUX in
And the USB for the charging
IPhone whether 4 or 5, you could charge the motherfucker on the 405
I'm in traffic but [?] blaring
Riding around feeling like LA's new mayor
And these Hollywood types take me for a chump
Cause I ain't got a house with the Beamer in front
But I got wheels that turn and speakers that bump
And I got cables in the back if you're in need of a jump

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Feel free to smoke while we bump these beats
Cause is burn the seats
My monthly payment is manageable
But my crew is questionable
I got a chick up in the front, she kind of average looking
She never met her dad and she bad at cooking
Got a homie in the back who been sniffing that white
Freestyling to himself, sounding not that tight
I kick him out, tell him "leave" and "go"
Heading to Korea Town, picked up E and Zo
Turntables in the trunk of the vehicle
Heading to the venue and we steal the show
Yo, I been bumping boom-bap since you cats were new jacks
[?] tapes we used back then
My driver seat's known to get loose at
[?] fuck you, your crew's wack
Pass the intoxicant, big Wax is dominant
And I don't need a fancy car to be confident
And my backseat's probably got your mom in it
[?], bitch

[Hook]
