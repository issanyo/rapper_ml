[Verse 1]
My chick is one out of a million, she a grand prize
Met her on the dash bus up in Van Nuys
That pretty face, accent, and them tan thighs
Make me fantasize all day, I hit it like

[Pre-Hook]
Boom, boom, ayy
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ayy
I'm tellin' ya, man, she don't quit
I hit it like: boom, boom, ayy
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ayy
And I don't think I can handle this shit

[Hook]
What's my motherfuckin' name?
Rosana – freaky, little mama
She be tryna fuck all day
Hit it from the mornin' to the evenin'
She be still fiendin', lil mamacita, don't play
What's my motherfuckin' name?
Rosana – freaky, little mama
She be tryna fuck all day
Hit it from the mornin' to the evenin'
She be still fiendin', lil mamacita, don't play

[Verse 2]
Ey, yo, me and her've been together for like a couple months
Mami got that punani sweeter than peanut butter crunch
I hit it from the back like a sucker punch
Bust a nut, back to the front for some uppercuts
And in the mornin' she be hookin' me up proper
Butt-naked in my kitchen while she cookin' me machaca
And before I go to work, she give me that boom-shocka-locka
I want to stay home and fuck her all day, I hit it like

[Pre-Hook]
Boom, boom, ayy
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ayy
I'm tellin' ya, man, she don't quit
I hit it like: boom, boom, ayy
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ayy
And I don't think I can handle this shit

[Hook]

What's my motherfuckin' name?

[Verse 3]
Yo, lotta joy, lotta pleasure, lotta pain, lotta misery
She turn me on, but she be drainin' me physically
And I mean that quite literally
'Cause I only got so many mini-mes swimmin' in me
Man, I give it all I got, but still she wants to get some more
Back to the bathroom, back to the bedroom
Back to the hall, to the kitchen floor
I don't know what I'm bitchin' for, 'cause I like it that way
And all I wanna do all day is hit it like

[Pre-Hook]
Boom, boom, ayy
She is untouchable
Boom, boom, ayy
I'm tellin' ya, man, she don't quit
Gonna hit it like: boom, boom, ayy
She is indestructible
Boom, boom, ayy
And I don't think I can handle this shit
