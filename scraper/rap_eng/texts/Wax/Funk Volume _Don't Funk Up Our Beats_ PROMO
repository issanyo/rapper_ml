[Verse]
The illest human known
Music built into my bones
Doing these poems since I was knee-high to a gnome
It takes a king many steps to get to the throne
Hard work can take awhile to pay off like a student loan
All the equity that you withdrew from home
Before the crisis mortgage prices remind me of rappers who I've known
They fall into a lack of evolution zone
Years and years go by, with no improvement shown
We should tell 'em all to quit
Intense Imagination man they jealous of my clique
Yo that pedestal you stood on you done fell up off it quick
You should use my pubic hair to repel off of my dick
I'm a, man of passion
Every pic demands a caption
Even Ansel Adams' hands would spasm if she planned to capture 'em
Manufacturing's not what I'm a product of
I'm the topic of discussions about people who rise above
Cause I can see the matrix through the third
But know how to enjoy it if the steak is what's preferred
I'm your favorite with words
May be a bit disturbed
Might be a bit concerned about myself because my safety's in jeopardy
These haters send me death threats
Through direct message like text was their best weapon
I reckon it wasn't read with a deadpan delivery
A side product of internet anonymity
And that's how I can tell you're very frail
And every story that you've ever told has been a fairy tale
Your bio is a depressing tale
On the metric scale you are five hundred kilos of epic fail
You are commonplace
You are like a toboggan race
Going downhill real quickly at on Olympic ski style and pace
Lookin' up at your mama's face you'd think that you would die
Well my shit's something that my family views with pride
Cause I write smooth and hot like the company Bic
Cause pens, shavers, and lighters are the company schtick
So if you fuck with me peace
The name's Wax capiche
Please don't fuck up these beats
