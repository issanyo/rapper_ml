Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil

Finger of suspicion
Pointing at us all
Says I'm guilty by omission
Heading for the fall

When the rumors fly
Someone's gonna cry
I wish that ...

But the damage that you do
Just might come back on you

Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
About nobody
Hear no evil, see no evil
Cause what you don't know won't hurt you oh no

Bad news travels faster
We both read between the lines
Courting our disaster
Just ?? find
Now the word is out
There's a shadow of doubt
There's a woman catching my eye
Oh, who are they
To talk that way
I wish they'd leave me alone
They got troubles of their own

Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
About nobody
Hear no evil, see no evil
Cause what you don't know won't hurt you oh no

Talk is cheap
Cheek to cheek
Don't speak
Don't sneak a peak
Talk is cheap
Cheek to cheek
Don't speak
Don't sneak a peak
Talk is cheap

Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
About nobody
Hear no evil, see no evil
Cause what you don't know won't hurt you oh no

Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
About nobody
Hear no evil, see no evil
Cause what you don't know won't hurt you oh no
