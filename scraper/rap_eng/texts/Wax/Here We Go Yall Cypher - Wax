Yo, I wish half of these dudes in this monotonous game was voiceless
Cause half the shit that they be droppin' is lame and boisterous
I got herbs of many tropical strains and choices
That keep me high like Milonakis' aging voice is
And you can catch me at the Arboretum feeding the Koi fish
Pondering life with old dudes like, is it pointless?
Various ? in the place
One dude came staring, I came to him in the face
And he tells me, "son, while you're healthy and young
You had better be dumb to let a chance go to waste"
And I took it to heart, took a step back, look at my arc
From way back in the distance
Said, since I got a choice and I got a voice
I'mma have to keep it on the path of persistence
One life is a rapping existence
Gotta live it before you die
It's a balance of doing what you love and what get you by
Fly with me and Herbs to the party on Mercury
We emulate Mardi Gras perfectly
The shuttle is boarding, 3-2-1 it's all love when we lift off
You get pissed off, you get kicked off
