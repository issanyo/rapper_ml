[Hook: Wax]

I want you to be, be my lady
But you never told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy (should have told me girl c’mon) It’s making me concerned for my safety
You should have told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy

[Verse 1: Wax]

Yo, I ain’t saying she’s a groupie but I met her at a show
Chillin with her friends giggling in the front row
Came up to me afterwards tryna buy a little merch
A CD and one of them fly with the shirts
So I gave her a discount, shirt half off
I was picturing her tits out shirt half off
Body of a freakin model legendary like a sleepy hollow
Took her home could have sworn we was being followed
I neglected my instinct and went inside and left my equipment in the ride
Hit it all night best sex of my life
Next morning I was gonna take her to breakfast to dorms
When we, got to my car
Man my tires was missing
My new guitar and amplifier was missing
I figured it was just a random neighborhood punk
Till I saw her name keyed into the paint on the trunk, man

[Hook]

I want you to be, be my lady
(Well) But you never told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy
(Never told me) It’s makin me (It's makin me!)
Concerned my safety, (Kinda scared)
You should have told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy

[Verse 2: Wax]

Yo, so I asked her to explain to me, why her name would be
On the back of my ride and she replied kinda angrily
(Definitely seems like something that my ex would do, he must have gotten out earlier than he expected to)
Gotten out?
What have I gotten inta?
That was last winter I’ve been with her ever since bra
What can I say I’m a sucker for a crazy bitch
Type that when you fuck they be slappin you in the face an shit
I love my new relationship, but every time I take my chick anywhere
Her crazy ex always ends up there
Following us wherever were walking at
Mean mugging from another machine up in the Laundromat
Last month we took a trip to Hawaii
Guess who’s in the aisle seat sittin right beside me
I tried to talk to him but he wouldn't listen
I hope he finds a new girl or goes back to prison

[Hook]

I want you to be, be my lady
But you never told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy (Fuckin psycho)
It’s makin me concerned for my safety
You should have told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy

[Verse 3: Wax]

He got a gang tattoo for every crew that exists
Bloods, Latin Kings, Piru’s and the Crips
Last month he was resting in jail man
This month he’s always on my block dressed as the mailman
That crazy bastards always up in my bizz
Every time I walk my dog that fool be walking his
But I’m used to in now so why ignore it
And that pussy’s so good I’d take a stab wound for it. (ouch)

[Hook x2]

I want you to be, be my lady
But you never told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy
(but you gotta lot of baggage with this dude)
It's makin me (drivin me bananas)
Concerned my safety
You should have told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy
(bout to file a restraining order)
I want you to be (I want you to be!)
Be my lady (be my lady!)
But you never told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy

It's makin me concerned for my safety
You should have told me your ex-boyfriend was crazy
