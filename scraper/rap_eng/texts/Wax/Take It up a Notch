(Let me tie my shoes right quick
Party people, let's take it up a notch
You thought we was just gonna keep the party at the same level
No, we won't do that)

[Verse 1: Wax]
She say I'ma meet you at the disco
Leave NY and meet in San Francisco
Me oh my, it's got to be official
Ain't nobody every really do it like this though
Oh, crack the red vino
Yellow cab and a black tuxedo
Brown cognac, purple tree, amigo
Orange you mean and green with envy though
Ay, that's true and to be honest what I do is never modest
I assume I'm an Adonis, I'm assumin' she the hottest
I'm assumin' she a goddess
I'm assumin' we ain't movin' to a room at the Ramada
Got a moonlight view from the balcony, son
I'm a player in a game that's about to be won
Grab a champagne glass and a bottle of scotch
Let's take this party up a notch

[Chorus]
Come on, take it up a notch
Raise the bar, take it up a notch
Come on, let's take this party up a notch
Come on, come on

[Verse 2: Herbal T]
I got some money in the bank, got some gas in the car
I got some bottles in the back where the passengers are
I pull up to the party, make a dash to the bar
Say "Hit me with your best shot" like Pat Benatar
Move back then I start makin' my way to the floor
Leave all your inhibitions and your hate at the door
It's settled, what we debatin' it for
I got a bottle of Don Julio I've been waitin' to pour
So fill your cup, throw it back, hit you straight to the core
And when I see my cup empty I'll be craving some more
The DJ's not mixing, he's creating a score
He's got the ladies on their feet like the race for the cure
They on the tables and floor shakin' what they momma gave 'em
If you got 'em please smoke 'em why bother tryin' to save 'em
Round three AM when I look at the watch
Let's take this party up a notch

[Chorus]

Where the ladies at? Hey (x4)
Shake, come on girl (x4)
Bring it down a notch (x4)
Now take it up a notch

[Chorus]
