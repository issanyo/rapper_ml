She sits on the couch imagining
She sees a future down the road
A life that's full of luxury
But she doesn't lift a finger, no

She wants everything
She wants paradise
But she's not cut out for it
She's not cut out for it
She wants everything

She watch the news to see what's goin on
Lots of different things around the globe
She got that college degree now
But it's not valuable

It ain't worth a thing
Especially when she wants everything

And she wants paradise
But she's not cut out for it
She's not cut out for it

She wants everything
She wants paradise
She wants everything

Paints her nails and doesn't do a thing
That's the value of a wedding ring
Four o'clock she watch that Jerry Spring
Drunk at six o'clock again

She wants everything
She wants paradise
She wants everything
She wants paradise
But she's not cut out for it
She's not cut out for it
Not cut out for it
She's not cut out for it

She wants everything
Everything (x4)
