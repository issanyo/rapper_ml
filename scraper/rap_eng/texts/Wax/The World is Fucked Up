The goverment's corrupt I know it
What the fuck you want me to do, go overthrow it ?
There's starving children everywhere you look
What the fuck you want me to do, I barely know how to cook
And I don't see a way to make it stop
When evil motherfuckers always make it to the top
If everyone was like me shit would be cool
We all would get along and be peaceful

But the world is fucked up, what can I do about it
The world is fucked up, what can I do about it
There's seven bilion people, and I am only one
The world is really really fucked up son

The Arabs and the Jews can't get along
What the fuck you want me to do, go sing 'em a song ?
ISIS just blew up an ambulance
I guess they never heard "give peace a chance"
Well I don't see a way to make it stop
When evil motherfuckers always make it to the top
If everyone was like me shit would be cool
We all would get along and be peaceful

But the world is fucked up, what can I do about it
The world is fucked up, what can I do about it
There's seven bilion people, and I am only one
The world is really really fucked up son

The enviroment is 'bout as bad as it can get
I recycled a can yesterday, that fixed it yet ?
The goverment gave the banks all our tax money
Well the can expect a harshly worded email from me
The oil companies have run amok
People protest them all the time, see if they give a fuck
They're fracking for natural gas and their drilling for tar
And I learned all about this on a radio while driving alone in my car
Well I don't see a way to make them quit
They're evil motherfuckers, and I'm a no good hypocrite
At this point I just turn the TV off
And do things such as smoke weed and play golf

'Cuz the world is fucked up, what can I do about it
The world is fucked up, what can I do about it
There's seven bilion people, and I am only one
The world is really really fucked up son
The world is really really fucked up son
The world is really really fucked up son
