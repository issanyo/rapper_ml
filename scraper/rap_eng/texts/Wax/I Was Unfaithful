[Intro: Tiger Woods]
I felt that I had worked hard my entire life
And deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me
I cheated, I was unfaithful (x3)
And I tend to dedicate myself to doing it
I cheated, I was unfaithful (x3)
And I tend to dedicate myself to doing it

[Verse 1: Wax]
I ain't mad at you player ain't no need to apologize
About them hoes that you sodomized
I was not surprised when I heard you had more than a few bitches
If I was you I would embrace my new image man
All of my caddies would be porn sluts
And we would film Bang Bus in my PGA tour bus
In my private jet, flying a mile high
Talking sponsorships with the Girls Gone Wild guy
Leave the grotto for them other bastards
I'd have playboy models skinny dipping in the water hazards
Gettin' dome in the sand trap
And after I nut, you'd hear a really soft hand clap
Pull my britches up
Then chip and putt
Grab the big check then I leave with a different slut
You're letting every man's dream go to waste
You should apologize for getting married in the first place

[Outro]
My fellow players, I am truly sorry
I cheated, I was unfaithful (x3)
And I tend to dedicate myself to doing it
I cheated, I was unfaithful (x3)
And I tend to dedicate myself to doing it
