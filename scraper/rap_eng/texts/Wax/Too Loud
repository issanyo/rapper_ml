[Hook]
Yeah, we too louuud
The police say we way to louuud
And all the neighbors say we way to louuud
That's why they trying to get my ass thrown out
But we don't turn it down, we just crank it up
Standing on the roof screaming we don't give a fuck
We like this shit loud, we let it bump
So if you turn it down you gonna get fucked up

[Verse 1]
Yo, I put my speakers to 11 and I set em and forget em'
Fuck the neighbors I ain't like em since the first time that I met em'
And I think I upset em' when I first pulled up
In the U-Haul truck, with the vol-ume all up
That same night they seen me chillin' on my roof all drunk
Urinatin' in the chimney, Santa Clause forgive me
My whole team's straight loud and obnoxious
Cops is at the door at 4 tryin' to stop us
You'd think we was holding you hostage
Over-weight rock chicks, in the kitchen starting up mosh pits
No Shake Weights, them hoes just break plates
Cooking like 8 steaks, looking like Kathy Bates
Fuck the pretty shit, we a bunch of idiots
The decibel level go-en make the whole city bitch
I party like I'm filthy rich
And if I spend it all tonight I won't feel no guiltiness

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
(prrrr)
Suffering Succotash, Wax gotta bunch of cash
Now I'm the sucker ass, fuckers in the upper class
Driving by me in a 350 Benz
I'd be in the the front yard in a drunk circle with my hicky friends
We coming one with the Earth
That marijuana nirvana man I've been grungy since birth
All that money is worthless if you ain't gonna spend it now
And you ain't said shit if you unless you said it louuud
I live fast like the the freaking hare
I ain't die young yet but I think I'm getting there
Like up in the diction-air-e, by the word rowdy
You gonna see my picture there, chillin' proud-ly
Say it loud like a proud James Brown
Or the Price Is Right announcer when a member of the crowd came down
He got that loud insane sound
If you feelin' like I'm feelin' sing it loud right nooow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If you rollin' down the street and you wylin' out to this beat
And you got that shit on repeat immediately you should (TURN IT UP)
If your significant other is bitchin' cuz you're always listenin' to your heavy metal too loud (TURN IT UP)
If you're a musician and you listenin' to yo own shit be proud and play it loud bitch (TURN IT UP)
If you're complainin' and screamin' about what I'm sayin' and meanin' then take this plate of my semen and fuckin'(SLURP IT UP)
