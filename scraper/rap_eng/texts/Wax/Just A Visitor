We don't want to be idolized
Just leave it at the door
We want to do something
That nothing can compare
And the spinning pencil heads
Take a look and write it down
'cause we're here just a while
Just a visitor in this town

What they want is a freak show
In the circus that they started
Glamorize it all
'cause when you're in, you're in demand
And if only for a second
You slip back and lose the pace
Just remember one thing;
There's a million kids with the right face

What I do
What I see
What I say
What you do
