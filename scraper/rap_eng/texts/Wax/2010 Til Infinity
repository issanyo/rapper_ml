[Intro]
Whattup this is Wax
I'm in the studio with Dumbfoundead
We are Clockwise
We're in North Hollywood
Sometimes it gets a little hectic up here
But right now we just gonna help you on how we just chill
Check it out

[Verse: Wax]
This is not for the less astute guppies
Go back to watching videos of cute puppies
Or little babies dancing to single ladies
Whatever stimulation or simple taste your brain needs
To remain pleased
I'm insane with the steez
I can drain three's or play in the paint with ease
At the banquet eating emcees
In a blanket, me and Herbal T gon' make it
This year and that's a bona fide fact
Last year's grind we gon' multiply that
Exponentially, Wax I stay rapping existentially
In other words it seems as if you had an extra Sentra key
And you was in the passenger seat next to me
Filming and can't wipe off that ecstasy pill grin
I'm bout to blow like an Arabian building
And become a sex symbol like porn made by Sabian and Zildjian
Maybe in a million years
You could beat me if I drank a billion beers
Don't risk the sight of your children's tears
Due to envy, you doo-doo emcee, They
See me as a big dog like I'm Clifford
So I make em put in work like I'm Kathy Lee Gifford
Me and many rappers? We differed
So I left em in the dust to the point they have to swiffered
I rock mics like Hammer rocked British Knights
This year I'm in the UK sipping Guinness pints
In a nice pub with my man Adam Gibbons
Til then I'm in America having Ribbons
Yeah, but as the plot gets thicker
It's way more music a lot less liquor
For years I've been on that "party all night" shit
This year I'm on some "take charge of my life" shit
All day, every day, any time, heavy grind
Whether I'm signed or unsigned I'm getting mine
"Sun never setting" shine, constantly
Run to the betting line, odds on me
It may seem like an unsafe wager
Cause my musics way too unsafe for a major
They want it in a box like Digidesign
It all sounds pretty similar like Biggie and Shyne
The music industry is a little behind
The other day I had a feeling I was finna to get signed
I looked on my balcony and a pigeon arrived
It had a record contract in its beak
With a note attached that said please have this back in a week
Just sign it and date and put it back in the beak
I seen a footnote on my third read
No postage necessary just bird seed
Yeah, a lot of rappers spit cleverly
But on top of the game they'll never be
If you want to eat the caviar and fresh frog legs
You gon' need a hook like golf with left dog legs
And I got that skill
But these old industry crackers think I'm not that ill
Fuck em, I'll get YouTube dollars instead
Fuck Akon on the hook, I'm a holler at Fred
And y'all think I'm lyin
I send him messages he just ain't replyin'
His assistant told me he's on the Cayman islands
With a bunch of naked dimes, bathin in diamonds
And I'm a get there with him
Based on mastering the kick snare rhythm
I'm the shit like guano, sick like mono
Don't push me, I'm close to the edge like Bono
And from '010 until
It ain't gon be no time to chill
We gon be making more sounds and creeping on more tours
Invading your towns and sleeping on your floors
Staying awake is the cousin of life
And for me sleep and death are now husband and wife
I'm a lock myself up and write songs in a cave
And flip shit like the master belongs to the slave
And in advance you can thank me, please
For filling up all of your blank CD's
I'm ain't stopping in this game until we run that shit
And I still wild out saying dumb ass shit
I fucked your mom in one room shack
Broke the bitch back like I stepped on a crack
She was rubbing my feet to put me in the right mood
She said, "What type of socks are those?"
I told her, "White Tube"
You don't wanna rap after me
You'll never be invited back like Kramer to the Laugh Factory
I'm leaving competition so shook
This year we stacking up more wins than a Vietnamese phone book
Yeah, I give a fuck about a hater
Tip said it best, "My time is too greater"
Cause if I don't spit flows better than a mug
No one at a Phish shows ever did a drug
Come on celebrate, go and light the Christmas trees
Everybody smile like colon right parenthesis
Happy New Year for 2000 and 10
And peace to my brothers Herbal T and EOM
