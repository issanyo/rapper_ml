Livin' Foul

[Hook]
I get older but don't stop livin' foul
My back is giving out
I need to simmer down, oh
Songs I used to sing I can't sing'em now
I killed my inner child
I'm livin' foul, oh

[Verse 1]
Man, all this drinking gon' catch up
Off Luda's first album
I was vibing with it, that was when I first heard 'bout 'em
At that point I was already living godlessly
Who'd a thought this shit was like a fortune cookie prophecy
My momma she would tell me "cancer is what you could get"
I disregard her, always saw it as some future shit
Well the future's now, and I got no shades
Shit is 'bout as bright as full-blown AIDS
I lack ambition but my talent keeps me cold and fed
Other rappers trippin' round the globe instead I'm home in bed
Hungover, back hurting, struggling, I'm
Reminiscing of the days with short recovery time
And I'm only still drinking because liquor still exists
And I only kill my brain cells because ignorance is bliss
I'm a good for nothing, chain-smoking, rapping alcoholic
So when I die at an early age, I called it

[Hook]
I get older but don't stop livin' foul
My back is giving out
I need to simmer down, oh
Songs I used to sing I can't sing'em now
I killed my inner child
I'm livin' foul, oh

[Verse 2]
I used to have a mean falsetto
Serenade a vixen in a green tall meadow
Now my vocals are thoroughly marlboro-y
Chords scarred plurally
It's beginning to worry me
A terrible future awaits me if I only worsen
I'm too spoiled to survive as a homeless person
I need to go to church and make a bold assertion
Have faith in Moses or some other fucking holy person
I dropped acid at my bus stop
I remember Liquid Swords just dropped
There's no vision quest for an idiot
I basically saw a bunch of trippy shit
My fans buy my music on the internet
I turn around and spend it on cigarettes
Realistically I could have been the best
But, man, nah
What the fuck you want me to do?
I'm just doing my thing, you know
Having fun, having a good time, you know

[Hook]
I get older but don't stop livin' foul
My back is giving out
I need to simmer down, oh
Songs I used to sing I can't sing'em now
I killed my inner child
I'm livin' foul, oh

[Bridge]
I'd like to thank everybody who believed in me
Even though I fucked up
Oh, yeah, but nothing
I said nothing, never
Nobody ever ever gonna fucking bring me down

[Hook]
I get older but don't stop livin' foul
My back is giving out
I need to simmer down, oh
Songs I used to sing I can't sing'em now
I killed my inner child
I'm livin' foul, oh

[Spoken-word outro]
Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha
You know man, you know
Not as old as me though
I stopped counting after seventeen thousand
Ha ha ha, still fucking though
