[Chorus]
You on it, I'm on it
If the world is ours then I'm ballin'
It's a paper chase that I'm caught in
If you on it, I'm on it
You on it, I'm on it
You on it, I'm on it

[Verse 1: Breezy Lovejoy]
Landlord knocking on my front door
Bright lights streaming through the glass window
Dear lord, will I ever see a million
Or will I die right before the prime deal come
And who am I to tell you not to get your money
When you're broke, struggle and strive to get your own money
Get it slow or get it fast as long as you hold somethin'
When it's gone, you get it back if you learn from it
Well I'm on it, got a seed to feed
Motherfuck a free show, you're insulting me
Stop stallin' and increase the green in my wallet
And increase the speed
These days ain't no telling how much 'grees you need
Cause you get caught up, be a product in a marketing scheme
Spending dollar after dollar
Ballin' ain't a problem
As long as you got some common sense to throw inside to offer

[Chorus]
You on it, I'm on it
If the world is ours then I'm ballin'
It's a paper chase that I'm caught in
If you on it, I'm on it
You on it, I'm on it
You on it, I'm on it

[Verse 2: Wax]
I try to keep it moving, never wanna slow the pace
When I go to chase for the cheddar in this rodent race
I know the taste well, it's quite bittersweet
Get fat and get looked at as a nice dinner treat
The bloodsuckers got their tentacles brandished
And they're snatching crumbs straight from the bread on your sandwich
You gotta stack more and more over time
As for me I'm tryna sorta be a hoarder with mine
I find it very unimportant to shine
I'm a simple dude
But I ain't to wait tables or deliver food
The paper chase can leave you in a constant bitter mood
I've become a selfish person, it's often considered rude
I ain't got time to speak much
I can barely find time to get my teeth brushed
Yeah, I'm working overtime waiting for the moment I'm
Ready to recline in the sun, then I'm done

[Chorus]
You on it, I'm on it
If the world is ours then I'm ballin'
It's a paper chase that I'm caught in
If you on it, I'm on it
You on it, I'm on it
You on it, I'm on it

[Verse 3 - Dumbfoundead]
Yeah, I can't ever seem to turn it off
I'm a certified hustler, certificates on the wall
My reality checks get me purchases and withdrawals
I get into my jet and women up out them drawers
I'm a Jetson
Yellow, that Futurama complexion
Replaces all my exes with dollar sign $'s
The rest is history, I don't even sleep no more
Resting's history, I'm always up 24 hours
Yes I am the rap Jack Bauer
Tryna play the system, I'mma hack that router
Give it back to the people that lack that power
If you like that, light that and pass that flower
Hit it once for your shitty job
Twice if your broke
Three times for the money and four for the show
And if you all about it, roll the dice, let it go
Cause you might roll seven, never know

[Chorus]
You on it, I'm on it
If the world is ours then I'm ballin'
It's a paper chase that I'm caught in
If you on it, I'm on it
You on it, I'm on it
You on it, I'm on it
