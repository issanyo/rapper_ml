[Intro]
If there was a crowd right here right now I would make em say all right
And if you know a damn thing about me you know I could do this all night

[Verse]
Big Wax I'm the best you know
My flow SHIT got CUNTFACE tourettes syndrom
I'm straight nutty, sorta like my penis hole when I'm horny
If y'all bananas, I'm Chiquita's whole inventory
At 16 I was rappin' great and I've stayed hot like Christina Applegate
Shit that makes chick teens masturbate
Rappers straight looking up to me like I'm Sistine Chapel paint
I care less each day
About what all you hating internet geeks say
Judging by the way that your always thinking of my ass
I'll assume your and gay and you probably wanna fuck my ass
My YouTubes like porn to you dudes
Probably keep my picture in your drawer with some lube tubes
And while you think about my dick and balls
I'll be at your girls house rippin' off her frickin' drawers
I got her face down hog tied
Pussy so wet you think it just got off the log ride
And when I do my thing she be screamin' "you the king"
Inside her so much she nicknamed me Nuva Ring
... she moans and she moans
When I twist around her nipples like rotary phones
There are so many Joneses but only one Wax
And its no need to clone cause God's already done that
The lord must me a silly guy
Cause my brothers a fuckin' beast and he don't even really try
I know it seems like a circus act
But name a set of twins that rap better than me and Herbal rap
Damn it mom! We should have been a boy band
Raw spitting at the audition up at Disneyland
Is Mickey Mouse in the frickin' house Anaheim?
Shout outs to my peeps in the chocolate-covered banana line
I say stupid shit... whatever!
Ain't nobody that can do this shit better
Line up all the rappers in the game that you say are hot
And for each one of em hand me one Jager shot
And watch me down em all, then clown em ell
They try to follow my lryics like they that bouncin' ball
This ain't karaoke night
Fly with me and Herbs its a very smoky flight
That purple berry kush got me feelin' like Elvis, thank you very much
Man, my teams all got medical cards
So if you fuck with us it best be on a federal charge
Obama, don't wanna get no drama
Its californ-ia brah we all blow ganja
The highest Hosanna, I'm the hottest know son, I'm
Fuckin yo momma, them I'm out like the road runna
My shit tough like a brillo pad
I stand tall y'all got the same shit that willow had
Y'all motherfuckers fit inside a shoe box
Me and EOM Paul Bunyan and his blue ox
You're an all around little girl, we NBA, y'all are small town intramural
We get compared to Guru and Premiere
You get compared to Sulu, you queer
My shit is random, my shit is damn dumb
Big on YouTube like Tantrum vs my man Dumb
I gets foul like and one
Have the fuckin' priest at your church like God Damn Son!
I'm fresh like croissant restaurant
And you're a big dummy like Lamont, what you want?
Y'all ain't fuckin' with the ill tones
Steppin' in the ring before you got your skills honed
Lil clone, you must be crazy player
If your lucky you'll get saved by the bell like A.C. Slater
Cause even on a cold day in hell
For you to beat me there is no way in hell
No fucking way, you are so fucking gay
You should go fucking play a game of cro fucking quet
And I'm out
