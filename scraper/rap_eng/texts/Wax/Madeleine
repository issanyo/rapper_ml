Made-Madeleine
Mad about Madeleine
I've been born again
Glad about Madeleine
I rejoice amen
Sad without Madeleine
Right on course again
Mad about Madeleine

If you see me steppin' on down the street
Cool cat in the heat
Wasn't easy but now I'm glad I'm here
Grinnin' from ear to ear

Madeleine
I do believe that I've been born again
I've found a reason to rejoice amen
I've seen the light
I'm right on course again
Madeleine

Nothin' doin' I tip-toe through the mines
I've fallen on troubled times
War on road to ruin
Been down quite a while
Now I got a brand new style

Madeleine
I do believe that I've been born again
I've found a reason to rejoice amen
I've seen the light
I'm right on course again
Madeleine

I believe the world's a better place
Just because a smile's upon her face
Inch by inch she helped me find my way
And now I've finally found her
Gonna make my world around her

Mad about Madeleine
I've been born again
Glad about Madeleine
I rejoice amen
Sad without Madeleine
Right on course again
Mad about Madeleine

When things got bad to worse
You came to lift the curse
Stop thinkin' in reverse
Your light shine down on me
Had my back against the wall
Now I feel about ten feet tall
Threw my castaway
I thought about a brand new day

Madeleine
I do believe that I've been born again
I've found a reason to rejoice amen
I've seen the light
I'm right on course again
Madeleine

Mad about Madeleine
I've been born again
Glad about Madeleine
I rejoice amen
Sad without Madeleine
Right on course again
Mad about Madeleine

Mad about Madeleine
I've been born again
Glad about Madeleine
I rejoice amen
Sad without Madeleine
Right on course again
Mad about Madeleine
