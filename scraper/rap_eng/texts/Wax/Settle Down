Sit down, have a water
Walk. Walk

I walked today
I walked so many places
I walked today (walk it off)
I saw so many faces

Til I go...
Settle down...

Hey settle down me
If you want to
I want to
Hey not now

I wasn't looking to feel this way
Might now know, I ain't the same
Don't try to read in, what I think
I'm not clear now on anything
