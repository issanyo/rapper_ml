[INTRO]

My future is a big wide open space
Got plenty of time and no place
My future is a big wide open space
Yeaah
And if I die there's no waste

[Verse 1: WAX]

Ain't got no kids, ain't got no girl
Can do whatever I want in the world
Ain't got no job that I can't quit
I ain't got shit and I kind of like it

[INTRO]
Cause my future is a big wide open space
Got plenty of time and no place
My future is a big wide open space
Yeaah
And if I die there's no waste

[Verse 2: WAX]

Ain't got no money, ain't got no house
I ain't got nothin' to worry about
If you stole all my money from my bank
Yeaah, Then you'd owe them, so you I thank

[INTRO]

My future is a big wide open space
Got plenty of time and no place
My future is a big wide open space
Yeaah
And if I die there's no waste

[HOOK: WAX]

I don't think about the money and the power
I know I'll never get 20 in an hour
I try not to worry and scour
I stop and I smell the proverbial flowers
Its no strife, no stressing
Cause its a fact that my life is a blessing
So I treat it like I'm cooking a pie
I see the future when I look in the sky
I say that because...

[INTRO]

My future is a big wide open space
Got plenty of time and no place
My future is a big wide open space
Yeaah
And if I die there's no waste

(aww, yeaah, yeah, c'mon)

My future is a big wide open space (its wide open y'all, c'mon)
Got plenty of time and no place (I ain't got no place to be)
My future is a big wide open space
Yeaah
And if I die there's no waste
