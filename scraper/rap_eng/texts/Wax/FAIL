[Intro: Excerpt from Price is Right]
Female contestant: "Gentlemen, do I have at least one number right?"
Bob Barker: "OH - ah... Was that a horn? No number right... Not. One. Number. Right. That has never happened before, y'know!"

Yeah, in fact I do know, Bob...
Man, these rappers remind me of that kid that falls off the log on YouTube into the creek
Check it out, uh

[Hook]
All we do is inhale, exhale
We succeed while y'all motherfuckers fail
It's as easy as breathin' for me to combine with the rhythm
EOM, I'm thinkin' that it's time that we hit 'em with the..
.. The price is wrong
We're thrice as good and been doin' this for twice as long
We're 'bout to go skiing in Vail
We succeed while y'all motherfuckers fail, FAIL

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I been making music ever since I was a mini tyke
Since Bob Barker started rockin' skinny mikes
Spent many busy nights tryna get it tight
Rappers tryna give advice, but the price isn't right
I heard your shit on facebook, I didn't like
It made me navigate to a different site
Your rhyming is terrible, you ain't spittin' right
Your timing's unbearable, man, your rhythm's white
Better take that test and get that GED, sir
You could still be a substitute PE teacher
You will never be as capable as me and E were
At thirteen
You are hurting
I'm asserting my point using evidence that you provided
I've come to the conclusion that you are too misguided
Music ain't somethin' everyone can supply well
You are an F TO THE A TO THE I, L

[Hook Version 2]
All we do is inhale, exhale
We succeed while y'all motherfuckers fail
It's as easy as breathin' for me to combine with the rhythm
EOM, I'm thinkin' that it's time that we hit 'em with the..
.. The price is wrong
We're thrice as good and been doin' this for twice as long
We just got accepted to Yale
We succeed while y'all motherfuckers fail, FAIL

[Verse 2]
We took a shit where the Grammy red carpet starts
So all the celebrities left our skidmarks
We did the fuckin' national anthem at the Superbowl with armpit farts, man
We set trends...
You ain't shit, follower
As a kid you were a paint-chip swallower
How does lead-based fire-engine red taste?
You were forced to sniff glue and were fed paste
'Til you were dumb and delirious
Don't let it get you down
You're just young and inexperienced
I've gripped hold of a few more mic stands
I spit cold like a blue Coors Light can
You must've fell from the Fail Tree
And hit every branch
You like a fat girl ordering heavy ranch
On her fried chicken salad with a diet coke
When pressure's on every time you choke

[Hook Version 2]
All we do is inhale, exhale
We succeed while y'all motherfuckers fail
It's as easy as breathin' for me to put rhyme with the rhythm
EOM, I'm thinkin' that it's time that we hit 'em with the..
.. The price is wrong
We're thrice as good and been doin' this for twice as long
Just got a million dollar check in the mail
We succeed while y'all motherfuckers fail, FAIL

[Hook]
