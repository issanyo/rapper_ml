She’s my everything, she’s my medicine, all I need is one small dose and I
Feel okay again, I hope that they'a can, refill my prescription

Yo, she’s got a force that surrounds her, a healing type of energy
Since the day I found her, I’m feeling like a better me
Whenever she’s in my vicinity, mentally and physically
I’m filled with tranquility
She has the ability to instantly change my mental weather from bad day to best day ever
When I met her I never thought I would sweat her like this
But I’m addicted to the medicine embedded in her lips man
A love seems like morphine in my bloodstream an endorphin rush
And after work I’m running out the door speeding, pedal to the floor, feenin' for one touch
And I’ll be damned, if I don’t feel my worry soar
Away when she opens up my front door
She’s so marvelous, can’t wait for my next visit to my pharmacist

You got me acting like a pill-popper, everytime we breakup, I don’t heal proper, rather go to you than a real doctor
Alot stronger than over the counter drugs, got me trippin' everyday on a 24-hour buzz
You keep stopping me when I be trynna plug the power plug, felt like I was in a coma because of you, now I’m up
I don’t care about the side effects read me my directions, Gettin' mad addicted, in need of some intervention
Lying on the bedroom just staring up at the ceiling fan, got me feeling good like I took a few hundred milligrams
I’ve always said that a women knows how to heal a man, she’s got some kind of special powers inside the pretty hands
Got my attention with the ritalin, happy on the Prozac, feeling like a kid again (damn)
Lightheaded, not getting enough oxygen, you are my medicine woman, I call you Dr. Quinn

Me-di-ca-ted, so se-da-ted, by the way that she moves
And I get high to thinkin' ‘bout us, can’t live without us, the drug I can’t refuse
Hey yo, my baby girl, such a nurse-like lover, I’m instantly healed at the first sight of her
And she can be my first child’s mother, no question, probably end up performing her own C-section

Test my reflexes and gives me a full check up, the only person who lowers my blood pressure
Taking good care of me, rocking a blue gown, physical therapy 'til temperature cools down
