[Intro]
Thank God for the rain which has helped wash away the garbage and trash off the sidewalks
Sick, venal
Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets

[Hook: Wax]
Walking in the rain
Pocket full of Change
Bout to get a bottle for the pain
To wash it all the way, I'll try...
If I could only stay this high
I wouldn't be concerned with whether I live or die

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Soaking in the rain
Hoping for a change
But for now I'm rollin up a J
To smoke it all away and Fly...
If I could only stay this high
I wouldn't be concerned with whether I live or die

[Verse 1: Wax]
I two step through an alley
Knocking trash cans over
Not gonna be performing my last dance sober
The last hangover I had
Is the last time that I'll ever feel bad
This time I'm trying not to come down
Thumbs down to that
Never again am I gonna do that
I keep walking getting wetter as I stroll
Through the heaven sent
Cold cleanser to the soul
On the bender till my cold body's tossed in the hole
I used to have lofty goals
Now I've lost control
Movin in whatever direction I'm tilted at
Full speed ahead
The demeanor of my head wasn't built for that
Freedom is a relative word
I see it's definition as I stare up at a flying by bird
Little drops pelt my eyeballs
Water-logged brain as the rain from the sky falls

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Half baked fully loaded
I don't have to sugar coat it
Not one of dem liars in denial with the wooden noses
I got a problem but my problem's the solution
Drowning out my sorrows with a bottle of excuses
I'm getting high my soul flies out my physical
Walkin in the rain so my tears aren't visible
Waiting in purgatory to see what I get sentenced to
Sippin on the bitches brew, the opposite of chicken soup
I treat the bar like a kissing booth
Liquor to the body is like ani to the wisdom tooth
No it won't last,but I'll take that cold glass in a second
Don't ask no questions
I find it as a blessin
A safe haven, escape bathin in weightlessness
Raindrops wash away the sins of this atheist
Clouds lookin down like, brotha I feel you
Fall asleep in puddles and wake up as morning mildew

[Hook]

[Outro]
Well, a little rain never hurt anybody
Yeah, but a lot can kill ya!

That was a great song about rain, but I've heard better
This is Tay Zonday and you're listening to Clockwise!
