In the company of morons
I swear they're unstoppable
Can't push, they're pushin' back
Watchin' the shoppers race this track
And they got places to go so fast
Fools connect, then they pass
Never need to get up
Just sit, watch and laugh and breathe

Don't walk, walk, walk too fast
You're tramplin' all your bags
Damaged goods and no, no receipt
And no receipt

Pocketbooks and credit slips
Day-Glo patterns, an old man trips
It's out of all inconvenience
Patience runs out of stock
At times, just one sale can make it right
Can make it right

Don't walk, walk, walk too fast
You're tramplin' all your bags
Damaged goods and no, no receipt

And no receipt
Don't walk, walk, walk too fast
You're tramplin' all your bags
Damaged goods and no, no receipt
And no receipt
Don't walk, walk, walk too fast
You're tramplin' all your bags
Damaged goods and no, no receipt
And no receipt

Pocketbooks and credit slips
Day-Glo patterns, an old man trips
It's out of all inconvenience
Patience runs out of stock
At times, just one sale can make it right
Can make it right

Don't walk, walk, walk too fast
You're tramplin' all your bags
Damaged goods and no, no receipt
And no receipt
