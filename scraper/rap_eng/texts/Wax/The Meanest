[Hook]
1-2-3 Ain't nobody fucking with me
I thought I told you I'm the motherfucking meanest
I thought I told you I'm a motherfucking genius (I be like)
1-2-3 Ain't nobody fucking with me
I thought I told you I'm the motherfucking meanest (uh - huh, yeah)
I thought I told you I'm a motherfucking genius (BITCH)

[Verse 1]
Motherfucker I'm sharp like the quill of a porcupine
Sorry I was late I'm still on my Yorker time
Had to fuck your girl right after crossing the borderline
On her pussy now there's a fucking "out of order" sign
She prefer the penis of a winner
You're a fetus, a beginner, I'm an elitist eating dinner
Out in Pari' sippin' sherry through a novelty Paris straw
Garnish with the cherry on it very small parasol
Walk up to a pair of broads like "do you wanna dance"
They be like "how you get in V.I.P wearing pajama pants?"
I'm like "maybe I ain't gotta dress fly, I'm in V.I.P cause people think I'm high"
That's just how they see me as
Earth got the same amount of spins as my cd has
I ain't working hard for this money, I ain't no greedy ass
Ain't nuttin' to it when I do it's just as easy as -

[Hook & Break]

I walk into a bar, they be like "look there's a pioneer
Can't believe that guy is here, we should probably buy him beer
Save the glass he drank out of as a souvenir, he's
The greatest gift ever given to the human ear" in your future years
Tell your grandkids dude was here
If they wanna be rappers suggest that they get a new career
Dry your stupid tears
Tell 'em to buy them to buy some scuba gear
To prep for that long walk they gotta take when they get to the pier
The short one, I'm sorry for your misfortune
But forthcoming rappers will be shortcoming rappers
I'm sure something matters besides your little dream
But ain't nobody fucking with me and my team

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I made this bridge to tell you that I'm the fucking man
So if you wanna suck my dick you can

[Break]
