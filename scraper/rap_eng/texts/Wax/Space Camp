Greetings Earthlings

I first started rapping at space camp on Cape Canaveral
I was the only rapper who wore klingon face makeup in battle
My lyrics are intriguing like a lecture about microchips
I don't hold the mic, I attach it to my glasses using alligator clips
I punch in and punch out like Mike Tyson and Little Mac
I'd have better breath control but my allergies are really wack
I think I just shit myself
Good thing I'm wearing a diaper
Where's my graph paper
I need it for the hip-hop cypher
If my calculations are correct I reek of cat shit
And there's semen all over my xena warrior princess magnet
I come correct like a student saying a squared plus b squared when referring to the Pythagorean theorem equals c squared
I think I smell a meteorite
Somebody romulate!
I don't sell crack, I manufacture hydrogen phosphate
