[Br-Break-Br-Break-Breakout]
From the west side
To the east side
Love is unchained tonight

Under street lights
Or by candle light
Love is unchained tonight

Strange vision on the floor
Someone you've never seen before
Feel the presence of a mystery
Yeh, it's time to set your inhibition free

Breakout
Tear this place apart
Breakout
This is where we start

From the east end
To the west end
Whoa, love is unchained tonight

Feel the power
Got the spell again
Whoa, love is unchained tonight

With every step your spirits climb
The spotlight tonight will shine
I don't act hypnotised
Yeh, it's calling for you on the party line

Breakout
Tear this place apart
Breakout
This is where we start

Breakout
Tear this place apart
Breakout
This is where we start

Love is unchained tonight
Love is unchained tonight

Strange vision on the floor
Someone you've never seen before
Feel the presence of a mystery
Yeh, it's time to set your inhibition free

Breakout
Tear this place apart
Breakout
This is where we start
