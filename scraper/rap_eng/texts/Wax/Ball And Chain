I am a working man
Doing the best I can
I toe the line each day

To those who set the pace
I'm just another face
But someday soon I'll lose this

Ball and chain
Everyday's a life of pain
Ball and chain
Feel like I'm dragging round this ball and chain

I'm only flesh and bone
Still they want blood from stone
And they cry more more more

Someday they'll know my name
If I can stand the strain
And I won't have to haul this

Ball and chain
Everyday's a life of pain
Ball and chain
Feel like I'm dragging 'round a ball and chain

Someday I'm gonna break out
And I'll be free
And living in paradise
I won't have to crawl
I'll walk with my head held high

Well day after day
And week after week
They wear you down
'Till you're dead on your feet
And what do you get?
What do you got?
You got nothin'

So you stay where you are
For security sake
You got a family to feed
And pennies to make
It's a damn...

Ball and chain
Everyday's a life of pain
Ball and chain
Feel like I'm dragging round a ball and chain

Ball and chain...
