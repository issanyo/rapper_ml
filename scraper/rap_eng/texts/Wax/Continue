Good mornin

[Hook]
Its alot of shit I done been through
But all that I can do is continue
If you step into a tornado, its probably gonna spin you
But all that you can do is continue
Dickheads, bitches I can smell the cunt in you
But all that I can do is continue
Livin my life until a hole's where my body's dumped into
Until then, I'mma continue

[Verse 1]
They say life moves fast no, it moves mad slow
Every mountaintop is just a new plateau
Another mountain on top of that yo
Now you like Sisyphus climbin forever screamin god's
An asshole
Pass go after givin it all ya have then you
End up back on Baltic Avenue
In that hotel that you ain't wana revisit
After Boardwalk celebratin mama we did it
Then you spent that 200 on some lottery tickets
Thinking possibly you'd win it, but you probably didn't
But the clock'll keep tickin there another turn comin
And hopefully you dumb ass'll learn somethin
Don't get offended, stupidity's something we're all born wit
Knowledge, that take a while to absorb it
That's why ya parents' advice, you ignored it
And did some old stupid-ass uniformed shit

Like this

You got caught shopliftin
You fuckin cheated on your girlfriend
And you didn't wear a condom
And then you got fired from McDonald's

Sometimes when life gets low gotta learn how to stick it out
I mean what the fuck else you gonna do that's what life is
All about

[Hook]
Its alot of shit I done been through
But all that I can do is continue
If you step into a tornado, its definitely gonna spin you
But all that you can do is continue
Dickheads, bitches I can smell the cunt in you
But all that I can do is continue
Livin my life until a hole's where my body's dumped into
Until then, I'mma continue

[Verse 2]
Negative thoughts are like a needy ass neighbor
Knockin on ya door for a greedy ass favor
And it always takes longer than they say it will
And even when the job's done them fools just wana
Stay and chill
Gotta kick em out right when it ends
Get too hospitable and they gon start invitin they friends
Like negative Nancy calls negative Clancy
And suddenly negative is the only thing you can see
I been there, its pointless
Cunts in ya head with their cunning little voices
It gets boisterous, but what you gunna do
I'll tell you what you gonna do gonna continue tell the
Cunt in you
To leave you got too much to achieve
Man you sure to win
Life's an arcade game put another quarter in
And have fun playin it
That shit I just said, I had fun sayin it

You developed a drug problem
You got clean but now ya back on em
To top it off, ya dog died
And then ya girl left now you contemplatin suicide

Sometimes when life gets low gotta learn how to stick it out
I mean what the fuck else you gunna do that's what life is
All about

Put the gun down Timmy that girl she ain't worth it
Move your penis into a vagina that deserves it
Nobody's perfect lighten up
Put some music in your morning and your day'll surely
Brighten up
Sunny days'll be back once more
And there's a good return policy at that gun store
You got two choices, one kill yourself
Two, make an attempt to fulfill yaself
One's logical the other's diabolical
A wise man will devise plans that are option filled
Be glad you got ya mama still

If you don't be glad you got ya father still
If you don't be glad that you can pop a pill
Drugged out better then a cemetery plot to fill
I ain't Doctor Phil, I'm just a dude
Whose tryna put you in a good mood, good mood yeah
I ain't Doctor Phil, I'm just a dude
Whose tryna put you in a good mood, good mood yeah
A good mood uh, a good mood yeah
That's all I'm tryna do is put you in a good mood
