[Chorus]
Check my watch
Time to go
I just waved my last hello today
Like hey
The time is up
Got to move
Not by truck, by inner tube
I float away, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't have time to survive
I wanna dive in from the highest of dives
I picture it as such a soothing place
Enjoy the pace of the current til the tube deflates
It sure would be safer
But that would be abhorrent I'm absorbed in my nature
I don't like thinking too much
And bridges have trolls that tell riddles and such
I like to be numb
Delightfully dumb
Part of me feels like I don't like what we've become
We've all got our own cures
Some chose Jesus
Some chose Coors
Decision making is a burden
Aspiring ascribing to a fate that isn't certain
I'mma show you what I know today
You never see me again, I just float away

[Chorus]
Check my watch
Time to go
I just waved my last hello today
Like hey
The time is up
Got to move
Not by truck, by inner tube
I float away, yeah

[Verse 2]
The dark side has a light that only some see
The devil holding a flashlight like "come with me"
The misconception is he's all bad
Some thoughts he's had are ones we've all had
Why do you think souls have been sold?
We all want a moment to hold
The way you held that loved one that's no longer here
Or held on to that dream as you looked in the mirror
You looked and saw Beyonce or saw yourself as Prince
You didn't see yourself and haven't been yourself since
We alcoholics see the beauty in the blurriness
We see it as a way we can be worriless
We fantasize about clean living
But also fantasize about, fuck it I'm swimming
I'm 'bout to do a cannonball
What was I talking 'bout?
I can't recall

[Outro]
Check my watch
Time to go
I just waved my last hello today
Goodbye
