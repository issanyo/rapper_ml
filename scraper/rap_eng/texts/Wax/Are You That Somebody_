[Intro]
Uh, dirty south (uh huh) can y'all really feel me?
East coast (feel it, feel it) west coast (feel it, what)
Eight away, uh
Can y'all really feel me? (Baby girl)
East coast (feel it, uh huh) west coast (what)

[Verse 1]
Whoa girl
I've been watching you like a hawk in the sky
That flies, and you are my prey (my prey)
Girl I promise you if we keep bumping heads
You know that one of these days
We gon' hook it up, probably talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holding back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it though

[Hook]
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking about nobody
Are you responsible?
Girl I gotta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my goal? Is it your goal?
Oh goody, goody
Right now I'm naughty, naughty
Say yes or say no
I really need somebody
So tell me are you that somebody now?

[Verse 2]
Whoa girl
Won't you pick me up from the park right now?
On the block while everyone sleeps
I'll be waiting there with my trench, my lugs, my hat
Just so I'm low-key
If you tell the world don't sleep
You know that would be weak
Whoa girl
See I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let it go

[Hook]
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking about nobody
Are you responsible?
Girl I gotta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my goal? Is it your goal?
Oh goody, goody
Right now I'm naughty, naughty
Say yes or say no
I really need somebody
So tell me are you that somebody now?

[WAX]
Baby girl
It's the man from the big MD
That you envy when he MCs
Rappers on the back knee
Muggin' all of a sudden and get real friendly
Big WAX
Don't you know I am the man?
Just to fuck shaking his hand
She ran from the stands to the band
With a detailed plan to be my number one female fan
I said "do you got a man?" she said "no"
Put her head low, and I said "hoe"
I wouldn't care either way
Just don't get your hair in the way
I wanna see
Don't worry, I won't tell nobody

If I really need somebody, bitch
I'll make you that somebody, oh!

[Hook]
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody
I'm talking about nobody
Are you responsible?
Girl I gotta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my goal? Is it your goal?
Oh goody, goody
Right now I'm naughty, naughty
Say yes or say no
I really need somebody
So tell me are you that somebody?
'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me are you that somebody now?
