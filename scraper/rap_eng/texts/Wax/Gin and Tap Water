It's past 2 A.M. and I'm thinking 'bout you
Just took my last sip off my last bud light brew
I wanna keep drinking, what should I do
They can't serve no alcohol like I said it's after two
There's only one thing in my freezer
It sits by itself just like me
A frosty old bottle of Seagrams
That reminds me of how it used to be
I've never seen no psychiatrist, I've never seen no shrink
But these lonely thoughts, they're all that I think
And it feels so lonely, when I stand by that sink
Gin and tap water is a lonely man's drink
