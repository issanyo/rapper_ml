We're gonna take a trip to some new destination
I got a pair of tickets for a dream tonight
You don't know what love is like
Baby till you ride on the good love line
'Cause we'll be travellin' on a train to Paradise

Won't you pack your bags and ride the

Railroad to heaven
Steamin' through the dark
Get on the right track baby
Choo-choo round my heart
Woo-woo-woo woh yeah

I wanna be your driver wanna be your conductor
Make a reservation on the Love Express
My heart is just speedin' away
'Cause our love is like a runaway train
I don't ever want to slow this motion down

Baby we're just ridin' on the

Railroad to heaven
Steamin' through the dark
Get on the right track baby
Choo-choo round my heart
Woo-woo-woo woh yeah

Passin' cars and countin' stars
We'd watch the world go by
Let's make a locomotion
Shakin' up the floor
Just give me a little signal now Honey
All on board Ha!

Railroad to heaven
Steamin' through the dark
Get on the right track baby
Choo-choo round my heart
Woo-woo-woo woh yeah
