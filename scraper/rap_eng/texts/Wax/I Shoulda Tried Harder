Nobody's perfect

[Hook]
If I woulda tried harder
I would be all I can be
If I woulda tried harder
I could have sailed the seven seas
If I woulda tried harder
I would be a better man
I guess I shoulda tried harder
But I didn't, so here I am
Here I am

[Verse 1]
I should probably be a star by now
But I'm probably at the bar by now
If you're hearing this past 5, or even 4
If it's morning I'm probably somewhere on a cement floor
Even more so if we're on tour
Me and E explore the country wondering about the evening before
Trying to explain where the time went
While other rappers find a studio to grind in
Kinda like when Kobe finds a gym
But the flow be Iverson
Yes homie I am him ('practice?')
I don't practice a lot
It's not a habit I got
I'd rather smoke pot and kick it with Craig and them
But Craig and them ain't making benjamins
They're just sitting on the couch again, again and again
Damn, free time, I always wasted it
I wonder what my life would've been like if I'd have gave a shit

[Hook]
If I woulda tried harder
I would be all I can be
If I woulda tried harder
I could have sailed the seven seas
If I woulda tried harder
I would be a better man
I guess I shoulda tried harder
But I didn't, so here I am

[Verse 2]
Back in high school, the shit was a breeze
I smoked a bunch of trees and I still got B's
Got high as fuck on my SAT's
Both as far as score making, and right before taking them
I've never worked harder at a job than required
I've only worked hard enough not to be fired
It's like Office Space
You'd have thought that Peter was there
Or Jennifer Aniston rocking minimum pieces of flair
I couldn't imagine what would've happened
If God wouldn't have made me good at rapping
It's only cause of that a good life I provide myself
But just think, what if I'd applied myself
I could be another level rich
Sponsored by a bubble beverage
On television talking about how good Dr. Pepper is
I wish I was as ambitious as 50 Cent
I could have went the same route that him and Diddy went
But alas...

[Hook]
If I woulda tried harder
I would be all I can be
If I woulda tried harder
I could have sailed the seven seas
If I woulda tried harder
I would be a better man
I guess I shoulda tried harder
But I didn't, so here I am

[Outro]
Michael Jordan, I ain't talking to you, nope
Oprah Winfrey, I ain't talking to you, nope
Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, I ain't talking to ya'll, nope
Tiger Woods, yeah, I possibly am talking to you
But Donald Trump I ain't talking to you
To my man who's the Pope, I ain't talking to you
To Chuck Norris, I ain't talking to you
Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, I ain't talking to you
Steve Jobs, rest in peace, but I ain't talking to you
To my mannnnnnnnnn- Neil Armstrong, I ain't talking to you
Or Lance Armstrong, I ain't talking to you
If your name is something that ends with Armstrong
I probably ain't talking to you
