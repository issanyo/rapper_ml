It's no misunderstanding
When pain goes hand in hand
You always play the bad guy
She the sacrificial lamb
Feel as vulnerable as a woman
And she takes it like a man
Listen what he said she said
He said she said

Push and pull up and down
Back and forth on the merry go round
And on and on it goes till someone throws it away

You'll pay for your admission
When you find you're losing ground
So you fight for your position
But nobody's backing down
You thought you'd spoken clearly
But she reads between the lines

Listen what he said she said
He said she said

Push and pull up and down
Back and forth on the merry go round
And on and on it goes till someone throws it away

Why can't we agree to be more tender
Surrender mmm - mmm
If two people care it should be easy happy
Why can't we be?

He said she said

You'll try to make the best of it
While looking in her eyes
'Til you find yourself in trouble
And you learn to compromise
But still somehow you just keep thinkin'
That she hurt your foolish pride
Listen what he said she said
He said she said
