Give a hater a hug
Cause even haters get love
Tell a hater cheer up, cheer up
Give a hater a hug

Give a hater a hug
Cause even haters get love
Tell a hater cheer up, cheer up
Give a hater a hug

[Verse 1: Watsky]

Hey that's the city
Traffic's always shitty
If you can't kick it happily then dammit that's a pity
You don't even have to be some hackie-sacking hippie
For you to be relaxed and free like Janet Jackson's titty
So wave your freak flag
If they don't like it they're a D-bag
They deserve a tea-bag
If they want to be mad
You could give â€˜em knee pads
Tell them to S on your D or your V (vag!)
Maybe daddy was mean
Or they got the tiniest penis
Or the hater gene
And you ended up in between it
And it seems that they're a little bit insecure
So they want you to feel smaller than an insect, sure sucks
When they hear what I recorded
And they wish I'd been aborted (wait, what?)
But it don't make me sore
I got to love them more

[Hook]

Give a hater a hug
Cause even haters get love
Tell a hater cheer up, cheer up
Give a hater a hug

Give a hater a hug
Cause even haters get love
Tell a hater cheer up, cheer up
Give a hater a hug

[Verse 2: Wax]

I get a lot of people judging my
Stuff that I
Put into the public eye
I used to wonder why
So many people would say that I'm gay and I should just give up and die
Now I shove my pride
And all of that stuff aside, see
Most of these haters that be commenting on YouTube
They respond with anger cause it's something that they're used to
Something in their childhood that left them with a loose screw
In their cabezas
We don't choose who raise us
No patience is given for the way that you're livin'
So I just made a decision
To say I forgive 'em
And give 'em a chance to make it in this unfavorable system
Before they do something crazy and shit in the name of religion
You sayin' you Christian but hate someone who's different than you
Ask yourself what the leader of your religion would do
Now roll up on a hater with some out-stretched arms
It ain't gonna do nobody no harm
