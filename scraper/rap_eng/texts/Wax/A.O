[Intro: Wax]
Yo what's up man this is Jed. I own Jed's Irish Pub across the street from your house. You know the one you walk by every day on the sidewalk? Anyway, I'm just gonna put up this folding chalkboard sign every single day for you to look at casually, with all our drink specials listed and how cheap and delicious it is. And you're gonna know how easy it would be for you to simply take a couple steps and walk in like everybody else

[Chorus]
I'm tryna stop drinking and I fucking hate it
The feeling that I get from it is underrated
I just wanna get so faded I become sedated
I'm tryna quit drinking and I fucking hate it

[Verse 1]
Fuck alcoholics anonymous
I'm gonna start a group called alcoholics obvious
With a good time alcohol is synonymous
I'm 'bout to break the fuck out of all my promises
I don't wanna drink anymore but I fuckin' do
If you know my music then you know that it's nothing new
I'm drinking carbonated water like it's a substitute
But I need 80 right now, this is nothing proof
Want the truth?
I hate clarity
In all sincerity I'd rather temporarily be acting merrily
And laugh hysterically until you have to carry me and throw me in back of a Grand Cherokee
I need some damn therapy but um
AA is not what I be needing
The lackluster greeting by sadly fucking repeating my name
30 years sober, you still at the meeting it's lame
I'd rather drink than that
Call me an aristocrat

[Chorus]
I'm tryna stop drinking and I fucking hate it
The feeling that I get from it is underrated
I just wanna get so faded I become sedated
I'm tryna quit drinking and I fucking hate it

[Verse 2]
I just don't wanna give it up
I know that drinking every day is fucking my liver up
I know it ain't my first love I know that the music is
I know I would've had more success in the music biz
If I would've stuck to writing lyrics instead of whiskey
But there's a whole battalion of demons embedded in me
And I never challenged 'em I always just fed 'em quickly
I guess I'm diseased
I wish all of the stress would just ease
I was a dreamer but the demons have undermined my quest
I used to watch myself and discover I was the best
But every smart brain has a dumber side I guess
Fill myself with depressants then wonder why I'm depressed
Fans tell me my art saves
Helps many people crawl out of some dark caves
But I wanna stay in mine I like where the darkness is
I'm going to the liquor store to visit my pharmacist
I'm giving up

[Chorus]
I'm tryna stop drinking and I fucking hate it
The feeling that I get from it is underrated
I just wanna get so faded I become sedated
I'm tryna quit drinking and I fucking hate it
