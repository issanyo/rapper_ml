She want a little picket fence house by the lake
She want to be up in a penthouse buy and stay
She want a wedding with a decked out giant cake (What else she want?)
I forget now, I am baked
I spent my pay check at the studio
And the rest on some Cali green from a male Julio
And I ain't save a cent
You 'gon have to pay the rent, This month
Forget all that shit that you want
I'm sayin'
No name brands you gon' have to shop common
Walmart, Kmart that the spot summit
Buy them other corporate ladder and i stop climbing
So the only top you gon' get to see is top ramen (eat em up)
No need to raise into quarrel
When all i got to give is love and occasional oral
So if you want more than that
Bitch it ain't gon' happen
So please stop motherfuckin yappin
Chorus
Hey Bitch, I ain't rich
And there's a lot of people in the world that got dicks
And since you so fit
You can take your pick
But you're gonna have to take a pay cut to be my chick
She want a couple diamond rings with a matchin' necklace
Filet mignon's are type of things she likes to have for breakfast
Not having less than Mecerdes or Cadillac or Lexus
Must of forgot who the fuck she was having sex with
It's Herbs, I'm totally broke
And what little extra I got I use it only to smoke
Wasting my money on your dinner i don't see the appeal
Let me break down my three course meal
Start with some rich crackers
Followed by the Campbell's Chunky Clam Chowder
The Kraft Mac and Cheese noodles with that yellow powder
Cuz Herbal T ain't into actin' phoney, she said (macaroni and cheese)
Bitch, it's cheese and macaroni
She want designer clothes imported from Paris
Tellin' no at the mall and she be sorta embarrassed
I know you wanna act fly and boast
But the only french products you gon' get from me are fries and toast
Chorus
Hey Bitch, I ain't rich
And there's a lot of people in the world that got dicks
And since you so fit
You can take your pick
But you're gonna have to take a pay cut to be my chick
Bridge (x2)
If you got a problem with the way that i role
Then there's a whole lot of other motherfuckers that'll take control
Cuz I ain't got a god damn thing but this music and my pride
And if you want something else get up out the ride
