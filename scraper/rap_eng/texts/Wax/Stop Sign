Why do I still try?
Why do I even care?
Why do I do anything at all?

A thought of you crosses in my head
Was it something I saw or someone said?
A thought of you goes through my brain
Was it something I saw or someome said?

I'm on a stop sign, on on a stop sign

What's in my head gets tangled by my tongue
Why do you stay?
Following the cuts of a certain shape
When all that's left is left to break
When all that's left is left to...break!

Someone said, I don't wanna break

I'm on a stop sign, on on a stop sign
