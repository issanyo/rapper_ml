My (3) aren’t you demanding/
You whine (3) about every damn thing/
Every lil thing I say or do/
Ends up being something that offends you/
So I (3) I’m through

I’m shocked by the extent of your audacity/
This is my house, ain’t no one here going be harassing me/
You say your lil snipe remarks so casually/
It’s blasphemy, let me tell you how it has to be/
It’s my choice if I want to bite my f* finger nail/
Or get INEBRIATED off to Crown and Ginger ALE/
I kick you out so fast it measures on THE RICHTER SCALE/
You got me confused with a different male/
Now I admit in the past with woman I’ve been kinda soft (no more)/
But see it’s like now I’m moving towards it like a moth/
I already got a mother hon/
I don’t need another one/
It’s mad more fish in the sea, go find a dumber one

[Hook]
My - My - My aren't you demanding - (You're Getting On My Nerves)
You whine - whine - whine about every damn thing - ('Bout To Kick You To The Curb)
And Every little thing I say or do - (Uh Huh)
Ends up being something that offends you - (Yeah)
So I - I - I - I - I’m through


I ain’t like the mother pussy you’ve been with in the past/
Constantly worshiping your pussy always kissing your ass/
I'mma in different class/
I’m a grown man, I'mma own man, stand alone man, got to where I am/
By executing my own plan and that program/
Didn’t include no holding hands/
I don’t need your guidance/
I don’t need A LECTURE CLASS/
Disrespect me in my house again/
You can bet your ass/
You’ll get kick out, without/
No ride get A METROPASS/
I ain’t gonna get jealous you can go ahead and get some ass/
I ain’t gonna get bitter on your FACEBOOK
OR Twitter ’bout who you fucking with OR whatever/
IF you consider me a BULLSHITTER get your shit together/
Prepare for eviction/
Sick of that bitch im not gonna listen/
I'mma try something different/
If an opportunity walks by I’m going try/
Get the f* out of my house, like that shit’s on fire Ho!

[Hook]
My - My - My aren't you demanding - (You're Always Moaning and Crying)
You whine - whine - whine about every damn thing - (Leave Me Alone, Stop Whining)
And Every little thing I say or do
Ends up being something that offends you
So I - I - I - I - I’m through

[Bridge]
NOW if you think I’m afraid to leave you/
Then go ahead and try your luck/
Coz you can beg and PLEAD AND get on your knees/
But I still won’t be giving a f*

[Hook]
My - My - My aren't you demanding - (I'm Done It's Over)
You whine - whine - whine about every damn thing - (I Hope You Get Run Over)
And Every little thing I say or do - (Nah Just Kidding I Didn't Mean that)
Ends up being something that offends you - (I Hope You Live a Healthy Life)
So I - I - I - I - I’m through
