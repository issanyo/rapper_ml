With a m-r-m-a-g-i-c
My name's mr. magic and you know that's me
Mr. magic that's who i be
Soon to be mr. magic o.b.e
When i was boy in my home town
I did not know that i'd be throwin' down
But as i got older, i got bolder
Realized that i was never falter
Went this all new town doin' to my name
Like dmc, i was looking for fame
So i joined with the wax dance party
And that is why you're listenin' to me

'cause...
