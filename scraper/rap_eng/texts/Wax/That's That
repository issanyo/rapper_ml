[Verse 1: Herbal T]
Ayo
Smooth and delicious
Y'all dudes are just bitches
I serve emcees and afterwards I have 'em doing the dishes
I move with the quickness
It's not about the jewels or the riches
This is rap calisthenics man, I do it for fitness
Yeah I know music's a business
I know 'bout the YouTube views and the clicks and the revenues for them bitches
I'm using them bitches to purchase something super nutritious
For my family like salmon, we make stew with them fishes
Emcees about to swim with the schools of the fishes
I'm gluing your pictures to walls and throwing darts at you and your clique
It's the Wax and Herbal T crew in this bitch
With the shit that make you bounce like them hydraulic coupes with the switches
Ya kangaroos are some crickets
Your gang of losers are finished
John Gotti swag, body bag, bruising and stitches
Ya think I had the flu with the sickness
I'm spewing, I gotta pull over, catch me roadside, puking in ditches
Rotten like Johnny from the group with Sid Vicious
Crews freeze like computers with glitches
Ya girl dreams about removing my britches and lubing my dick with some lubricant
Using her tits and then doing exuberant shit
When the fluids emitting it looks like Elmer's Glue cause it sticks
That surprised look on her face shows how stupid the bitch is
Herbs move crowds like a preacher with his pews full of Christians
And once again your gang of losers are finished and that's that

[Hook: Herbal T and Wax](Repeat x2)
Uh
My crew that shit
Whole crowd so loud saying do that shit
A 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in this bitch
Can't believe they got the people so live in this bitch
And that's that

[Verse 2: Herbal T]
The way I felt when I was writing this tune
It's kind of like huffing a nitrous balloon on a flight to the moon
Like lightning was striking the room
Like fucking around and trying to fight Mike Tyson, couple of rights and you're doomed
Y'all really good at sucking like Dyson vacuums
I throw your CD in the garbage for the mice and raccoons
Wack emcees, I don't need a fork and knife to consume
Cause all these cotton candy rappers I could slice with a spoon
Ya mama should have took your life in the womb
I recommend you put a hose to your tail pipe and siphon the fumes
I got you tripping like as if I laced the cypher with shrooms
Y'all gotta be high like them witches taking flights on them brooms
It's like I was biting a prune
Cause I be dropping mad shit soon, ass sounding like a bassoon
Herbal T broke joke money trifling but soon
I'm trying to see that big cake like a wife and a groom

[Hook](Repeat x2)
