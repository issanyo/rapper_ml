[Chorus]
My ex-girlfriends are all doing just fine
I cross one of their paths from time to time
They had to make a run
'Cause they could never be my number one
My first love is these words that rhyme

[Verse 1]
Another love come and gone and another song
She had to run along like she had left the oven on
A choice demo in my voice memos
A poem that's sappy in my Notepad app
She can't be blamed
A woman's love can't be tamed
Any attempt to keep it sane will just further fan the flame
You'll be like "girl I can explain"
Please let me do so
Settle down, settle down, don't get testy Cujo
You see this music is much more than just a hobby of mine
It's got a godly design
Yeah it's oddly divine
Which is probably a sign that I should not be resigned
To doing menial tasks like I'm in a remedial class
So if you leave me like the last one did
I can't be mad
Speaking of the last one
She just had a kid
I'm 'bout to go to CVS, and get her a card
And write a note to tell her family that I send my regards
Sincerely

[Chorus]
My ex-girlfriends are all doing just fine
I cross one of their paths from time to time
They had to make a run
'Cause they could never be my number one
My first love is these words that rhyme

[Verse 2]
You ain't gotta rap for you to relate
If your craft surpasses passion for the woman you date
And all the spats you had don't add anything to the debate
There's nothing soothing about another mood swing
It ain't just a dude thing
It moves both genders
Past obstacles that had removed most pretenders
The type of fervent calling that'll fuel coke benders
And burn like Hendrix did to all those fuel-soaked fenders
I live in a van now, I move home September
Next time you see me I'll be someone you don't remember
I love laying next to you at home in my bed
But even when I'm with you it's like I'm alone in my head
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Moses is dead
And soon I will be too
I'll probably never love a woman like she needs to be loved
So from now on I'm pimpin' like my hero Eazy E was

[Chorus]
My ex-girlfriends are all doing just fine
I cross one of their paths from time to time
They had to make a run
'Cause they could never be the number one
My first love is these words that rhyme

[Outro]
Jockin' the bitches
Slappin' the hoes
