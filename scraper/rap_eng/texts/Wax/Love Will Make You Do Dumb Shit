[Chorus]
Be careful who you pick
You don't wanna get too close too quick
Whether you're a dude or you're a chick, yeah yeah yeah
Love will make you do dumb shit
You'll become a hypocrite
It'll make you go against logic
Whatever you should do you do the opposite, yeah yeah yeah
Love will make you do dumb shit

[Verse 1: Awkwafina]
To be honest I'm on shit
Hiding in this closet
Love I am losing, a bitch really lost it
How did I get here?
Soon I'll be a convict
I'm on IG and I'm stalking his mom's pics
I'm in a tree with police grade binoculars
Program his virtual dick on my oculus
Started last April
Everything was gravy
Got a turkey baster
Tryna have his babies
But come Thanksgiving, his fam thinks I'm crazy
They weren't sure about me like I was Steve Avery
Might be a murderer, might be a saint
But when it come to love I go hard in the paint

[Chorus]
Be careful who you pick
You don't wanna get too close too quick
Whether you're a dude or you're a chick, yeah yeah yeah
Love will make you do dumb shit
You'll become a hypocrite
It'll make you go against logic
Whatever you should do you do the opposite, yeah yeah yeah
Love will make you do dumb shit

[Verse 2: Wax]
I spent all my rent money on some flowers and some jewelry
Maxed out my credit cards on movies and sushi
I thought that I was being great
Something she'd appreciate
And after that much needed date she was like "I need some space"
I was numb and it shocked
Tried to text her to get her back but my number was blocked
Now I'm pacing in my kitchen
Her face is what I'm missing
Why oh why am I infatuated with this bitch
I'm frickin' clickin' through her Facebook, stalking like an idiot
She already got a new boyfriend she kicks it with
Click every picture
That they ever tooken
Jealous 'cause he's richer than me and better looking
Now all of her posts be some cute love quotes
He got a boat I be like "fuck boats"
I hope the boat sinks and I hope you both drown
Love will turn a smart man into a clown

[Chorus]
Be careful who you pick
You don't wanna get too close too quick
Whether you're a dude or you're a chick, yeah yeah yeah
Love will make you do dumb shit
You'll become a hypocrite
It'll make you go against logic
Whatever you should do you do the opposite, yeah yeah yeah
Love will make you do dumb shit

[Spoken outro: Wax]
The moral of the story is, bitches ain't shit. Dudes ain't shit either. It don't matter how old you are, it don't matter how experienced you are - you fall in love you probably gon' act jealous and crazy. So my advice - 3 months tops man, you can't let a relationship go longer than like 3 months man. As if. 4 months is too much. 5 months is way too much. Cut that shit off

[Audio Snippet]
You make me feel so young
