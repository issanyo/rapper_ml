[Acumental]
Find me on the block blowing reefer like a smokestack, cheifin'
Stashin' weed baggies in my coat for safekeepin'
The herb that I'm tokin' be the certified potent
Try the homie up the street if you prefer to buy bullshit
I'm holdin', William, roll 10 phillies up
Hit the blunt yo, we let smoke billow up, it's the
Cumbersome Thunder Cats, puffing your nugget stash
Lungs full of bubble hash, suffering succotash!
Hey yo we fam, son (Nephews, Nieces)
Getting spaced out like, (Neptune, Venus)
Uh, my eyes are glazed like a donut, labelled a stoner
But the doctors diagnosed me with a case of glaucoma
So roll one, relapse, ring me if you need that
Green grass shit to make your kneecaps weak, yeah
We sellin' weed bags, uptown highs
Acumental, yellow teeth, black lungs, brown eyes

[Hook]
I weigh grams of it, I weigh eighths of it
Dank cannabis, I make papes with it
Bag it up bitch, bag it up
Bag it up bitch, bag it up
I get ounces, I get pounds
We split owls and pass the shit round
Bag it up bitch, bag it up
Bag it up bitch, bag it up

[Terminal Knowledge]
I sell weed, smoke weed, LBs, OZs
Term bag it up like, come help with the groceries
I get it in bulk for the package deal, half hash plant
Half incredible hulk, all vacuum sealed
Shrubs cost g's for a dub, no McClintock
One hit quit, got the dro in the ziplock
Nuggets in a ball jar, cash crop, customers know
Black lung be the muh-fuckin call card
So listen up what I'm telling' you:
Don't legalize it, that'll fuck with my revenue!
And yo I best get my pay, smokey know
Term Big Worm and it's Next Next Friday
Scrub Life, puff pipes, gnarly as a bumfight
Harvesting my bud by artificial sunlight
I run a tight ship, shit Wax gets it legally
Pass him the mic while he pass me the greenery

[Hook]

[Wax]
I ain't smoke the greatest weed at first
When I got a bag I had to de-seed it first
That DC D-street was the worst,
Each seed individually hand-picked
Turn an eighth to a gram quick
Move to Cali where the trees are legal cash crops
Seeing street dealers, that's like people seeing sasquatch
Got my prescription from a doctor in a leather coat
He could hear my back pain, using a stethoscope
He puts the Kush in a prescription jar
No need to get in my car, cuz this shit isn't far away
Buying marijuana while I wear pajamas
Or flip flops, man it's cut and dry Americana
Like a hamburger with fries
Or putting pumpkin, apple or pecan up in your pies
Get a canister the size of it make sure that it's shut
And staple up the paper homie, please bag it up, bitch
