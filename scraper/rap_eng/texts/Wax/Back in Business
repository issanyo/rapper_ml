[Chorus x2]
Ah yeah, we back in business baby
Ah yeah, we back in business baby
Woohoo, we back in business baby
Ah yeah, we back in business baby

[Verse 1: Wax]
Ain't a dang thing changed, same
Top of the game again, poppin' campaign
My brain droppin' insane remain rockin'
And shamin' lame brains who ain't stoppin' the rain
You know the name, we droppin planes for profitable gains
On a regular basis we in tropical places
We behavin' this way since every product amazes
On the topic of results we bosses never seen losses
You weak and cross us, be cautious
My business is never executed sloppily
Makin' sure the paperwork is taken care of properly
The contract rests on a desk of mahogany
Before I sign the line and double check the terminology
A lawyer reads it first, accountant reads it next
I only accept the large golf course novelty checks
I finally put my name next to the "X"
And then I get on the jet to Mexico
Let's fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Herbal T]
You makin' stupid decisions, I put your crew in submission
And ruin intentions of doin' somethin' new and original
True individual, smooth 'cause I do it habitual
And after years I became a proven official
I'm that kind of person rhymin' cursin'
I been keepin' it fresh like Tide detergent
Music is my church, I'll step inside and worship
Never conquer and divide we unify and perfect
Harmony like a pharmacy, supplies are purchased
With the dope out, no doubt, higher learnin'
Herbs in the back yard fire burnin'
Light it up and rotate it like a tire turnin'
Never had a need for a girl who's trouble
Ask what type of butt I like, I choose bubble
Herbal T attack a track with a quickness
It's official: we back in business

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Puttin' in work (Good God!)
Puttin' in work
We puttin' In work
Puttin' in work (What we doin' y'all? Everybody!)
We puttin' in work
Puttin' in work (Good God!)
Puttin' in work
Puttin' in work

[Chorus x2]
