I know you must've phoned
Cause you can't live without me
But my answering machine
Must be going on the blink

I know you want to say
Want to say you're sorry
But the message on the phone
Sounded like "leave me alone"

I must've bought a faulty unit
You couldn't want a world without me in it
And up till now it was working like a dream
Uh oh uh oh
Bug in the machine

Must be something wrong
Got a bad connection
The wires must be crossed
I know it can't be you i lost

Your voice was sounding strange to me
Like on your own was what you want to be
Reuniteds what i'm sure you mean
Uh oh uh oh
Bug in the machine

Oh i'm standing on the edge
Of a nervous breakdown
Cause an answering machine
You and i has come between

Can't hold a one way conversation
I need some real communication
I'd like to fix that little green
Uh oh uh oh
Bug in the machine

I know you must've phoned
'cause you can't live without me
My answering machine
Must be going on the blink
