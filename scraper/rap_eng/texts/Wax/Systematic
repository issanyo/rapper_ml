Hey!

Got my life worked out 'cause I was born a methodical man
Now that I'm all grown up I wanna put you in my master plan
If you turn me down, no problem at all
I've got a backup system and a failsafe wherewithal

I'll do what I have to do
Take one step at a time, for you

Cause I'm systematic
Systematic, know what to do
Systematic
I'm systematically working on you
Hey!

Step by step I'm gonna wear your resistance down
I've got my mind made up and now my wheels are spinning around and around and around and around
I'm on the case 24 hours a day
Ohh and I won't give up until you see things my way

Ohhhhh nothing can bother me
Cause I look at it logically

Cause I'm systematic
Systematic, know what to do
Systematic
I'm systematically working on you
Systematic (woo)
Systematic, know what to do
Systematic (ow!)
I'm systematically working on you
Hey!

Yup

I'll do what I have to do
Take one step at a time, for you

Cause I'm systematic
Systematic, know what to do
Systematic
I'm systematically working on you
Systematic (woo)
Systematic, know what to do
Systematic
Cause I'm systematically working on you

Systematic
Systematic (ow!)
Systematic
Systematic
Hey!
