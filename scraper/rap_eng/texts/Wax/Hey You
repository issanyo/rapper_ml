Hey you!
Would you like to come back to my room
I'm really hoping that you do because I can not wait to
Take journey over your body
You got me thinking that you're probably just so playful
We can roll a doobie
Or watch a kinky movie
And try to exactly what they do
Whatever you see fit
Tonight just might be the ultimate

Yo weekend vacation
Ocean City
Girls getting wild, getting shitty, showing tittes
I don't usually go to clubs
Because I roll with scrubs
And door guys give us shoulder shrugs
We gets no love cause we don't act properly
They won't let us in cause were drunk and dress sloppily
But the beach is a casual place
So we just strolled in the club at a gradual pace
We got a spot in the corner and found
A waitress (Hey miss)
Started ordering rounds, and pouring 'em down
Our throats but I got up quick to go
Dance cause I really, really love Bell Biv Devoe
They were playing my request, "Do Me"
And I flipped out at when I laid my eyes on the girl next to me
She looked like a career model
And it's still kinda early so I'm not wearing my beer googles

Hey you!
Would you like to come back to my room

And try to exactly what they do
Whatever you see fit

Dude she looked good
And I'm hoping to find
A quote in my mind
Some type of opening line
And hopefully I think of something clever
But that's really hard to do when you got no game whatsoever
I said fuck it and approached her very happily
And noticed that she was finished with her strawberry daiquiri
I said "Hi do you think
We could go over to the bar together and I could buy you a drink?"
She said "Okay" and I was surprised
She probably get's that type of offer from dozens of guys
I'm loving her eyes and lips
And the size of tits
And the way her pants fit on them thighs and hips
We sat at the bar cordially
And drank and laughed together until last call at quarter to 3
This girl was off the hook, son
She liked walks on the beach so we wandered off and took one

Hey you!

We was alone in the dark snorkeling
She had her ass sticking out the water like a fucking shark's dorsal fin
I never had a girl of this high a caliber
All I could think about was sliding in and out of her
She swam to my position
And we hit the sense and started kissing gently
And I could feel her rubbing up her tits against me
It felt good until she began straddling
And I had to start dog paddling
Straight battling
To stay afloat. She told me to stick it in her
I said I'm horny but I'm not an Olympic swimmer
I had to swim to the shore
To continue the fore-
Play and get into it more
We caught a wave to the beach. Went at it the whole night
It was the best sex I ever had in my whole life
I woke up with seaweed in my draws and shit
That night was the ultimate!
