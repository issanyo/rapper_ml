Maybe just lately I'm lonely
Maybe things at home not what they should be
And maybe I notice the way you act around me
But you shouldn't take it too seriously

Maybe I called you but that doesn't mean
That I really want you closer to me
But maybe I knew we'd both end up here in this way
You, you make it so easy to stray

Maybe I'm tempted but it ain't right
Maybe I better say goodnight
But maybe I'm human and passion's strong
Maybe I can't stop what we've begun

Maybe there's trouble for me and my wife
Maybe our coming here was unwise
But maybe I see my reflection in your shining eyes
You, you make it too easy to stay

Maybe I'm tempted but it ain't right
Maybe I better say goodnight
But maybe I'm human and passion's strong
Maybe I can't stop what we've begun

Want you too much
Yes I want you too much
Yes I burn for your touch
Oooh
Lookin' that way
You make it to easy for me
Oooh
To lose control

Maybe I'm tempted but it ain't right
Maybe I better say goodnight
But maybe I'm human and passion's strong
Maybe I can't stop what we've begun
