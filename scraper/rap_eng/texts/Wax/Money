[Intro]

Money
Ohh ye x8

[Verse 1]

Yo man, fuck
So much stress on my mind it's hard to stay sober
It increased the load of the weight on my shoulders
I hit the liquor store for another can colder, use my debit card
I hope it ain't over the limit, cus' you know what that be
Another 25 for the overdraft fee
Where does that go exactly, I don't know exactly, but it isn't to the lower class people
Looking for a check in stressed out conditions
Regretting horrible decisions, like me
Who just got a DUI, and I can't afford it the fees are too high
And there's no one on the plane but I, but I can't provide water for my wells run dry
And I got ripped of last year, I ain't money trees
Looking a merry day, it's still just fucking leafs
A couple D's to spare change the sum
Who are those people, what are they named and (num?)
First, I'm so stressed I'm cutting the (worbs?)
I laugh at the situation cus' it's fucking absurd (waaahh)
Check my swag as I rip it, I pull out my hair but I can't quite rip it
And I can't afford a damn plane ticket, for a plane ride, if I could I'd go to Maine and hide

[Hook]

I really need some
Money
Somebody send me some
Money
More money, more problems, man that isn't clear, money makes most of my problems disappear
Damn I need
Money
I'm at the jam, I need
Money
Yo, my life's constantly armed and legged, I ain't to proud to beg give me
Money

[Verse 2]

Eyo, desperate's how I'm living today
Fucked up thing I only want money just to give it away
My paycheck goes straight to pay debt
And when it's all gone I realize I ain't (eight??) yet
And it's starting to get, til' the point where I sacrifice art for a check
For real, I give a fuck how any fan feel
Record labels holler at me, I'll sign any damn deal
I won't even read it first
But I might try to eat it first
As long as it has an advance
You think I can't make up some dumbass dance
The stanky leg, ye I guess it had charm
But wait till they get a load of the well-scented-arm
I change up my image in the (minute main??)
Shoot myself in the leg, say that I was in a gang
I start rhyming soft and wack, anything to get Verizon on my back
Would you like some fries and toast with that
I'm exhausted my mind is lost and flat

[Hook]
