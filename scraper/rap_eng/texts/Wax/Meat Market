[Jess Hudak]
Even though outside it is springtime
It's winter in my mind
And I need someone to hold on to
Just to pass the time
I'm sorry baby
You forget to save me
Oh, but hey, at least you tried
But don't you worry, close your eyes
Come along for the ride

[Wax]
I appreciate you trying but I
Really need to get me some shut eye
You're the one I turn to
But this doesn't only concern you
It also involves all these vivid images that I turn to
In my head, do you care if I turn you?
And hit from behind, cause facial expressions be tricking my mind
Something abnormal occurs
And your face, it just morphs into her's
Her voice reciting your words
And her touch is much more inviting than yours
I cum and my vision unblurs
Then the moment of truth occurs
You're just medicine, not the cure
Now clean yourself off with that towel on the floor

[Jess Hudak]
I cannot save you again
For I feel like my heart will never learn
How dare you make me feel alive
Don't you know how to ???
Even though I don't really love you
You take away the pain
And you don't care as long as I do
For you the very same
And temporarily
We forget the memory
Of the one that made us cry
So don't you worry close your eyes
Come along for the ride

[Know One]
I can't help but thinking when I'm standing next to you
Is it just drinking and meaningless sex to you?
Nevertheless how could I ever question you
I picked your brain just to get to the rest of you
The best of you's not up for grabs
So I'll take any pieces that you'll let me have
As for me, I'mma be honest, I promised
My love to someone that just split it in half
So let's hit the gas 'till we crash
In a fabulous clashing of metal and glass
So fashioning a passion from our sorted past
So I'm passing it back at the fork in the path
Cause I know the math, and I've studied the science
Nothing can come from this hollow alliance
Just for tonight we can fabricate smiles
Tomorrow we'll patch our broads will adhesive denial

[Jess Hudak]
I cannot save you again
For I feel like my heart will never learn
How dare you make me feel alive
Don't you know how to ???
