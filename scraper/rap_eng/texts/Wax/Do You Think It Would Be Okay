Intro:

I had to write something for the females, man
Cause you know how they be affecting you
You walk up to them
And you're so flabbergasted by their appearance
That when you finally get the courage to talk to them
You say some childish shit
Some shit like this, check it

Hook:

Do you think it'd be okay
For me to be your man? (Baby, baby)
And do you think it would be okay
For me to hold your hand? (Shoobadoopbadooo!)

Verse 1:

Check it out girl-
Ayo, what did your parents feed you as a kid
To have you turn out as beautiful as you did?
Fresh strawberries all in your crib
Morning Similac
Tell your parents take notes so we can remember that
You got a smile so bright that it smolders
And transmits beauty through eyes of all beholders
You all natural, actual, no fake shit-
Type of girl you take to the carnival and eat funnel cakes with
I wanna take you on paddleboat
You got me reminiscing
Back to when I passing notes
You've turned a grown man into a sixth grader
This is what you'd read on the little piece of ripped paper:

Hook:

Do you think it'd be okay
For me to be your man? (Baby, baby)
And do you think it would be okay
For me to hold your hand?

Verse 2:

Yo, yo-
I bet your sweat tastes like it's got sugar in it
I bet your nose ain't never had a booger in it
I bet you've never had a pimpled on your face
And your shit probably smells like that Cinnabon place (chica)
You got me weaker than S.W.V's knees
You're the bees knees;
Honey please grab your keys
It's too loud, let's break out of the bar
And hit the parking lot and make out in my car
I'm trying to get a free sample of them cute pink lips
Ponder that over your last few drink sips!
I don't mean to be up front
I'm just making suggestions
This ain't rocket science girl
These are very simple questions

Hook:

Do you think it'd be okay
For me to be your man? (Baby, baby)
And do you think it would be okay
For me to hold your hand?

Verse 3:

You ain't the type of chick I just wanna get it on with
You're the type of chick I wanna cook a breakfast omelette
And make it real cheesy
Kinda like this song hit
Cause usually I'm spitting this raw shit
But for you I've lost it
You make my knees buckle
And I can see the freak in you beneath of that sweet chuckle
Cause when the time comes you'll be acting like a slut-
Telling me to pull your hair
And smack you on the butt
And I'mma do it real fast
No questions asked
Whatever the task, that feminine adrenaline blast
Is going to come
I got the future on the brain
I wanna marry you-
By the way, what's your name?

Hook:

Do you think it'd be okay
For me to be your man? (I'm trying to ask politely, Baby, baby, cause I've been staring at that ass )
And do you think it would be okay
For me to hold your hand?

Bridge:

I know you've seen this on the video
Probably never on the radio
Girl I want to feel your titties though
I'm thinking you could have my baby, though

I know you've seen this on the video
They need to play this on the radio
Girl I need to feel your titties though
I'm thinking you could have my baby, yo
