[Verse 1]
There's this girl I know, she's always on mind
I love it how our paths always seem to intertwine
She could be my everything, I know she could be mine
But to be my everything, requires too much time
From me
She cool, She's smart
She got a good head, she give good heart

There's this girl I know, she lives right down the street
So we ain't gotta go too far to go out for a bite to eat
She could be my everything, I could probably date her
But if she was my everything, I'd probably fucking hate her
She cool, She's smart
She got a good head, she give good heart

[Hook]
She could be everything, pulling on my heart strings
It be driving me insane, I ain't got time to play these games
I need my schedule free, She just maybe
In love with me
But in love ain't something I want to be

[Verse 2]
There's this girl I know, she's always on my phone
Calling, texting, asking questions
She don't ever want to leave me alone
She could be my everything, She could be the one
But if she was my everything, I'd never get shit done
She cool, She's smart
She drives me nuts, she makes me bust several bananas
B-A-N-A, Shut up, trick!

[Hook x2]
