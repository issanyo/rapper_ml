Always got a feeling that I'm doing too well (I don't mean it)
Always making promises that I break too well
I never get caught 'cause I do it too well
I'm doing everything and I'm doing it well

And oh I drink too well
And oh I steal too well
And oh I cheat too well
And oh I ain't too well

Always gotta preach and you bitch too well (I don't mean it)
Everything you're saying I've heard too well
Now you're gonna get it (get it) get it too well
Superstar, superstar, superstar fell!
