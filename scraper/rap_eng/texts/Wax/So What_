Verse 1:
It was a Sunday morning here in southern California and I'm stumbling into my room.  I got my girl lying next to me, my manager keeps texting me bout' all the shit I'm supposed to do
But I just Ignore it, tell my girl get the liquor run for it
Its a big world out there lets explore it, hop into the car and  just floor it. Now we Jim and Buffett stees. Margaritas Puffin' trees. And If someone calls trying to fuck with me
I just tell em'.....


[Chorus X2]
What? So What? Ain't nobody gonna fuck this up
I tell them What? So What? I said it and I meant It, don't regret It cuz we get It I said What?



Verse 2: Feet style sittin'. Tall can Sippin' , We ain't trippin' we as cool as can be. Cuz stripping ain't a option when your sittin' there watchin', the sun dropping below the sea
I tell my girl stand by me like Ben E. King. If you don't wanna do anything. Freedom from my phone, I'm a just let it ring
Practicing PDA, not caring what people say
If somebody got somethin' mean to say Ill  lean there way and Ill just tell em....



[Chours X2]
What? So What? Ain't nobody gonna fuck this up
I tell them What? So What? I said it and I meant It, don't regret It cuz we get It I said What?




Verse 3: Tomorrow Is a new day, I just need today anything that you say won't be heard. So mine as well not say a word
People say that the end is getting near
I don't care I can wash It off with some beer
While I'm sittin' here, just sippin' beer
Do you think that your voice Is the last thing that I wanna fuckin' hear? Hell no. I'm a toss my cellphone into the [?]


[Chorus X2]
