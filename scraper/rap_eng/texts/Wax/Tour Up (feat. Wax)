We roll up in your city and take over for the night
Soon as we step out the van, we be feeling alright
Smoke blowing out the window, refilling my cup
We tour up, yup, we tour up, yup, we tour up The hotel room we're staying in tore up
The old ass club we're playing in is tore up
The fans in the crowd are loud and tore up
Yup, we tour up, yup, we tour up Goodness gracious, great balls of fuego
The van's flyer than the Spaceballs Winnebago
At least it was when the tour was first starting up
Now it smells like feet, and has trouble starting up We going hard as fuck, tearing every market up
Spark it up, ashes on the floor, burning carpet up
And all the trees, did I mention they're free
Cause we get hooked up every night, quite generously In the parking lot, people give us doobies and baggies
Now the van's all mysterious like Scooby and Shaggy's
I don't know who you people are
But if you ain't part of the tour, female, you need to leave the car Another day, another show sellout
Then we turn the hotel out, then roll the hell out
Man, rock 'n' roll, never looking in the rear view
Train wreck coming soon to a city near you Got a DJ and a band, we crammed inside a minivan
Hitting cities and signing titties of all my women fans
I got a pen in hand, eenie meenie miney mo
Squeeze 'em bring 'em nice and close, I'm just gonna sign em both We over here, I'm drinking the local beer
We pounding more in one night than you did in your whole career
The type that promoters fear, but the fans love
Cause I'm the champ, put the amps and your hands up And get 'em high, just one night, Knocksteady and Scrublife
You're not ready, got THC as my blood type
My dude fans wanna smoke me out
All my girl fans say they got an open house We kill shows with freestyles and prepared rhymes
Call me the mayor, this city I have declared mine
We travel roads, train tracks, and airlines
With one mission: to blow back your hairlines Every crowd, every stage, every mic (Tour Up)
Every blunt, every joint, every pipe (Tour Up)
Girl I was whipped last night, was tore up
Yup, we tour up, yup, we tour up Zo's throwing up the in the back, he's tore up
Some ho's throwing up in his lap, she's tore up
We partying all over the map, we tour up
Yup, we tour up, yup, we tour up
