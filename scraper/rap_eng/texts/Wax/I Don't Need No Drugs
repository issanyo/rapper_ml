[Chorus] {x2}
I don't take no drugs
La la la
I don't need no drugs
La la la

[Verse 1]
You shouldn't have taken that acid
If you think that you should kill yourself, do that shit
I'm just kiddin, you just trippin, I've been sipping
So I'm into sitting round bullshitting
I ain't thinking, 'bout no fricking problems
I be drinking often, so I'm feeling awesome
Till I'm in a coffin, whoa oh oh oh oh oh
I sing like that Aerosmith dude
He did cocaine and heroin too
Whether Billie Holiday, or whoever the fuck
Yeah, the music gets us high but it's never enough
And I never w-was a fan of just plain reality
Whether good or bad, I yearn for abnormality
It's natural, ever came in a lady?
You high for 5 seconds, then later comes a baby
Do the math, it's built in us to want to get high
So before I pass out let's sing a lullaby, like

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I tried to go the perfect route
Quitting drugs, eating healthy and working out
But it's never satisfactory
My demons run after me, I slow down casually
We sit down together and we have some tea
They speak to me, they tell me how my life should be
They're real persuasive, they fuck with me, they comfort me
Tell me I'm only lonely when they don't keep me company
Pick your fork in the road
Both paved with portions of shit and portions of gold
When I was still a young buck my fortune was told
They said "Son as far as talent you have more than a fortune bestowed
Upon you, now how you gon' use it?
Will you be abusive or make beautiful music?"
And under oath I quoth both
I stay getting high like the population growth

[Chorus]
