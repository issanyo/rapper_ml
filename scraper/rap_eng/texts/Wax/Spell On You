Little by little
I feel you slippin' from me
He's playin' his hand
And now its easy to see
Oh baby now little by little
You're takin' him seriously

And I'm so scared of where it ends
You're in too deep to be just friends

Somebody went and put a spell on you
Makin' you do what you shouldn't do
Hypnotised you into playin' a fool
Somebody went and put a spell on you

Little by little
He's tryin' to take you away
And if you want to go
I guess there's nothing to say
Oh baby now don't do that
I want you to stay

Protect our love, don't let it slip
Just hold on fast, or i'll lose my grip

Somebody went and put a spell on you
Makin' you do what you shouldn't do
Hypnotised you into playin' a fool
Somebody went and put a spell on you

Shake it up shake it up shake it up
Shake it up baby

Ah don't you know
He's playing a dangerous game
Break it up, break it up
Break it up now
Before it goes too far
'cause the magic's got to end
And you'll be left without a friend

Little by little
You're takin' him seriously

And i'm so scared of where it ends
You're in too deep to be just friends

Somebody went and put a spell on you
Makin' you do what you shouldn't do
Hypnotised you into playin' a fool
Somebody went and put a spell on you
