Big Wax the flow is amazing
She wanna get up on the pole in the basement
And keep it on the low with the days in
Keep it real slow
Mill it out from the draw that we blazin'
She said her day jobs boring and hates it
She wanna get a little glorification
She wanna fiddle you for a sensation
That comes from crushing slow
I know
Life moves fast in the city
When they got you struggling for cash
It's a pity
But you so full of passion and pretty
I'm a lick you from your head
To your toe
To your ass
To your oops
Didn't mean to sound nasty
But right now it's all about relaxing
Lets do this like a de da a dee da da dum

[Wax]
She doesn't want no speedy love
She only only wants a slowbawawawo
She's lost in the city life
And the nights been so cold
So cold so cold
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Wax]
She don't want , so much
(yeah yeah yeah)
She got her own touch
(her own touch)
She said no, its no rush

(slow crush)
She don't want , so much

She got her own touch
