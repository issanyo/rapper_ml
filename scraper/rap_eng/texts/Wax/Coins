[Verse]
Eat a dick
Or at least eat a Pita chip, right after I skeet on it you piece of shit
Tell your lie speaking lips they should try pleadin' fifths
More often, bitch, and refer to me as 'Your Awesomeness'
You saying me and so and so are comparable
Then I look up so and so and they're terrible
You disgust me
Trendy rappers fall the hell off the map
After just one listen I can tell off the bat
There will never been a time that I have to rewind it
On some 'God damn, what was that line?' shit
In fact I find it, rather boring's the category I put them in
Fast forward that whack verse I'd rather hear the hook again
I would rate your skills very low level
And your softness is at a Pillsberry dough level
Me, I've got the gold medal flow that'll put my on the freaking podium
You're child's play, you Nickolodeon
I'm about to sprinkle sodium all over them wounds
Big Wax, EOM, homie. Don't get confused
Shouldn't get your hopes up when you know you gon' lose
You won't accomplish anything, if you don't pay your dues
I'm saying, with all the shit I've charged to the game
The game should issue me a credit card in my name
No we aren't the same. You a motherfucking ant size
My catalogue's Jack's beanstalk plant size
I'm sick of y'all saying y'all spit well
When y'all shit sound like dog shit smell
Seriously, take it back and say you're joking
When you rap, everyone behind your back does that masturbating motion
I've worked hard for this
While y'all half assed it
Raised the white flag, matter fact, half mast it
Half this rap shit that you hear is half plastic
The other human half is a lying ass bastard
Fake biters like dentures
Writing their bios based on someone else's adventures
I be confusing the censors with the shit that I speak
Cause they don't know if its some shit they should bleep
They're like "Damn, that the fifth time this week
That I've witnessed a sheet
Of lyrics from this geek
On my desk for inspection
To bleep or not to bleep is an excellent question
These words have yet to receive Webster's attention
Spanish Webster is still fucking with the gender
Only point I'm trying to make, to give em something to remember
When they're spitting on the microphone, or strumming on a Fender
These kids get mixed up like cumming in a blender
Same goes for you lame trolls blogging
I would recommend less dick riding and more jogging
You at your computer desk, sipping your Super Big Gulp
Eating Little Debbie snacks and Newton's full of fig pulp
I'm talking to you, it's sunny out, enjoy it
The bicycle you purchased was like money down the toilet
Yo, it's funny how steroided your confidence seems
When the last time you got laid Hipsters were rocking big jeans
2Pac was in his teens. Variations of the running man were popular routines
Little NAS was up in Queens yet to write. It ain't hard to tell
He was still busy watching the Smurfs battle Gargamel
Fuck it. I'll just keep rapping great
Outside of the box like you used cheap packing tape
Try again. There's no time to waste
Just make sure the drawing board you go back to is dry erase
That shit you Sharpie ain't gone never be sharper
Unless that Magic Marker is an actual magical marker
Even then, it'd have to have a good battery charger
Cause I've been rapping since Eric Clapton was back with the Yardbirds
I wish you the best of luck
If y'all agree with me that most rappers suck
Then make like a rake on the back of a landscaping truck
And stand the fuck up
