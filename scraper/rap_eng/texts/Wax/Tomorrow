[Hook]
I ain't ever gonna drink again
I ain't ever gonna smoke again
And I'm gonna start tomorrow
I'm gonna be my own best friend
This time it's not pretend
Everything's gonna be different tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Yo, since I got this money
I ain't been able to walk straight
I'm buying drugs and alcohol at the bulk rate
Man this change has been crazy
I'll probably end up living like Rick James in the 80's
People say I should get up on a 12 step
But this is too fun to seek help yet
I'm probably gonna ruin my career
And the money that I got I'll go through it in a year
Man I'm through with drinking beer, I'm so done popping E
Come tomorrow ain't no one stopping me
I'm going join a fucking soccer league
But that's tomorrow man, tonight I'm getting fucked up you best believe that shit

[Hook]

[Bridge]
So tonight is my last hurrah
And I'm gonna get super tomorrow trashed at my bar
I know everything's gonna work out right
And I sing this song every night

[Verse 2]
Yo, I ain't even gotta walk to the corner store
I call this company called store to door
They deliver in the morning or night
So I can always order bud light
I'm like a kid in a candy store
But more like a pedophile in a little girl's pantie drawer
Damn the shit ain't right
I'm gonna change but not tonight man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow, check it out!
I'm so stupid to be this rich
Got my own big house you should see this bitch
Got my own studio with a motherfucking bar in it
A driveway got my brand new car in it
I need to wise up
I need to act right
Fuck it, let's celebrate this one last night

[Hook]

[Bridge]
