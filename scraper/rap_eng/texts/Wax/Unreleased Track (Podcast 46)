[Hook]
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mo-mon
They say c'mon, c'mon
And just keep on talkin' that shit

[Verse 1]
Ay yo you can find me where your mommy stay
Feeding her the meat like I'm Bobby Flay
I run this town like what Rihanna would probably say
But I do it more in a Muammar Gaddafi way
Happy Gilmore slice you with the hockey skate
And let the blood of cheesy rappers drip atop my broccoli plate
I spit wasabi paste
Y'all are just a copy-paste
I don't know what you been smokin' on but it was probably laced
Think you fuckin' with me, you must be drugged out
You haven't learned to be prepared yet cubscout
Get the fuck out
Figure out your bus route
And when you get home you probably gonna get cussed out
It's way past your goddamn curfew
And you know how bad mom's hands can hurt you
She gon' spank you like the ho that you are
And you ain't gonna be going nowhere tomorrow
And she'll be singing

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm bringing it back for these wack new jacks
I'm here to show 'em heat
Too many of 'em busy dangling from my scrotum meat
Flow's weak you have no repeat value
Can't do it yourself gotta show you freakin' how to
I'm very sick probably never will be proper healed
Fucking up the game like I'm streaking through a soccer field
Insert your own punchline here with the word balls...
Round of applause
You can rap too Timmy that's the spirit boy
Pretty soon you'll be making it rain like dancing Iroquois
The huge tiger shoulda instilled more fear in Roy
Instead it left him and Sigfried's career destroyed
I'm like him calm in the cage
But I'll bite your fucking head off once we're on the stage
I'm on a page that's in a different book from you dummies
And the one you in is yellow, and the book is for dummies

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo you would have to not be sober to test
You're mediocre at best
Same old, same old as the rest
I got the best cess smoke in my chest
If the press said I liked you I was quoted in jest
Your girl claim we closer than a coat or a vest
Last time I talked to her was when I told her get dressed
In the back of a limousine, skeet all over her chest
Rolled up the window in the middle at the chauffeur's request
Cause he don't wanna see that mess
Kept his eyes on the road and his focus on the street address
And when the GPS said we was at the spot
I kicked her ass to the curb in the Panda Express parking lot
Gave her seven dollars for the kung-pow
She was like "what's up with me and you?"
I said "we're done now"
Somehow slow and surely I'm succeeding
I've heard it many times but it's worthy of repeating

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
It would be a massive travesty for you to say you rap as nastily as me when factually you be the wackest act I've seen ever
You be better playing me in bumper pool
You're a dumber fool than the dumbest kid at summer school
Yeah, dunce isn't your kinda caps
You had your fifteenth, 'bout to see your time elapse
Career going downhill like spinal taps
Just started the rat race already on your final laps
I run shit to the point I get shin splints
You're a little girl you should sell thin mints
I grind hard, I been putting work in since
Half of these rappers was practically infants
Y'all ain't even borderline ill
Y'all just a bunch of fucking porcupine quills
You pricks
Replace the marshmallow peep chicks
And eat a Easter basket full of dicks
While I'm singing

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
Ayo I ain't the most witty man ever
But when it comes to talking stupid shit I'm pretty damn clever
I know it's a pretty grand endeavor
But I don't plan on stopping till I'm copping like fifty grand a measure
At that time I'll just sit upon my throne
Drinking out the type of cup that Lil Jon would own
And I ain't gonna have a damn phone
I will be accessible by front door intercom alone
But it'll be hard as shit to find my home
Where I spend my days cold chillin' by my fishing pond I own
Sitting on a pony
Sipping on Peroni
Listening to Tony, Toni, and fuckin' Ton√©
I just sip scotch
And other types of booze
Only wearing flip-flops
No other types of shoes
That's my dream, that's the ultimate
And I'mma get all of it just by talking this shit

[Hook]
