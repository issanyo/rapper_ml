[Hook: Devon Lee]
Midnight, staring at an empty sky
I realize, everyday we death defy
The further I go, the more that I learn
The more that I know it's 'bout to be my turn
Cause I'm grown, grown

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
A nigga grown, on my own, I been paying bills
Saving still, said "no" to a major deal, I take what's real
Hard working, cause stagnant's a thing I hate to feel
So every verse and every song with every bar I aim to kill
Groupies say, "let's chill", I'm with it if you 'bout it
We at the crib and we sipping, I hit it then kick her outty
If I'm with Dizzy it's cloudy
If I'm with Eric it's rowdy
If I'm with Aktion it's cracking
I'm snapping, nobody doubt me
And I've been through it
But now we grown-ups, gotta grow up
They show up when my show's up
It's sold out and you know what?
That's cool shit
Achievements, I look back as I surpass em
But never forget the first time that it happened
And as I'm on the road
I'm loving this busy life that I chose
I'm doing everything I want before a nigga get too old
I take pictures with my fans
I'm happy and my smile shows
I tell my mama that I got it cause she have me, now I'm grown

[Hook: Devon Lee]
Midnight, staring at an empty sky
I realize, everyday we death defy
The further I go, the more that I learn
The more that I know it's 'bout to be my turn
Cause I'm grown, grown

[Verse 2: Wax]
I'm sitting at home with the beer
Listen with the phone to my ear
Sound of my mother's voice, so consoling to hear
As I get older it seems like more and more every year
She's becoming less of a mother and more of a peer
We be
Talkin' ‘bout my taxes, I’m tryna’ wild out
She tells me how much better calm and relaxed is
But getting fucked up's what I do best
And I ain't tryna make life a snooze fest
I'm just tryna be less reckless
Less sipping Becks with breakfast
Less unprotected sex with exes
Less ecstasy and less excess
Less stress
I don't know how many breaths my chest got left of death
I used to be fearless, now I sense it's nearness
So I'm tryna cherish every experience that I can
Cause I'm a grown ass man
Going each and every place with the mic in my hand
It's like that...

[Hook: Devon Lee]
Midnight, staring at an empty sky
I realize, everyday we death defy
The further I go, the more that I learn
The more that I know it's 'bout to be my turn
Cause I'm grown, grown

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Weed man filling my good sack
Summer nights with the clock pushed back
The sun going down
My texts going round
I'mma throw one of them house parties
Cause I'm not out hardly
Telling myself I'm doing well, now let me see how you handle it
Business coming in and I'm learning and understanding it
Telling my management, like I need to live in the moment
So I'm approaching everything like we did frozen
Some people won't understand that we stand back and reminisce on them bus missions
Don't trust niggas, can't trust women
I learnt that in Unit 51
Since then I've been doing this for fun, word
I don't partake in the hate, like I ain't heard of it
The older you grow the smaller your circle gets
Feeling different now that I'm on my own
In my home taking this blunt to the dome
I guess I'm grown, word, word, word, word
Sing it one time

[Hook: Devon Lee]
Midnight, staring at an empty sky

Cause I'm grown, grown
Midnight, staring at an empty sky
I realize, everyday we death defy
The further I go, the more that I learn
The more that I know it's 'bout to be my turn
Cause I'm grown, grown
