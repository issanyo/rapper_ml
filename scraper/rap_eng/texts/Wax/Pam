Hello cubscouts
This is a song of a good girl gone awry
Please gather round the campfire with us

I always thought you was so strong
I heard you got a weak spot on your arm
I wanted my baby's mama to be just like you

Goddamn
Goddamn what happened to Pam

It seems like love comes and goes
With you it's all or nothing I suppose
I never thought that you could get so low
It's not like I tried to help you though
I wanted my baby's mama to be just like you

Goddamn

Goddamn

Was it yo man
Was it yo man, did you follow your man

Goddamn
Goddamn what happened to Pam

I heard they took your girl away
She ain't fit, that's what I heard them say
Well I'm fucked if that is true
'Cause I still want my baby's mama to be just like you

Let's go!
This is the part where everybody dances
Fuck yeah!
Put on your dancin' fuckin' shoes
Give me a P
Give me an A
Everybody frolic and be happy and gay
Give me a P
Give me an A
Everybody frolic just be merry and gay
