[Verse 1: Gradient]
Yo, since day one I oughta confess
I’ve been on my grind to find a lotta success
Many are content to just bottle the stress
But there’s a couple of problems we gotta address
They might say that you need to fit a size two
They might say that you need to disguise who
You love or they’ll say that it’s sinful or untrue
But your joy is contingent upon you
When it makes you feel angry and stressful
Stomach twists into knots like a pretzel
On the days when the pain is so dreadful
Block out the hate with some headphones, yeah
'Cause even when your day goes wrong
You can still listen to your favorite song
Forget about how arrogant they are
While you rock the fuck out and play air guitar
Look, ‘cause no offense to all my best friends
But music is my all-time best friend
It’s therapy, that’s why I perform this
Give up for Wax on the chorus, let’s go!

[Chorus: Wax]
Day by day I just try to solidify my little life
(And the trumpets blow)
Day by day I just try to solidify my little life
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Wax]
Yo, the world’s full of pain and misery
I feel it everyday even when I don’t project it visibly
It’s something I wasn’t prepared for
Went to the music, it asked what I was there for
I said I came for the healing
I came so my fam won’t have to see me hang from the ceiling
Came for the pain that I’m feeling
I came for the same reason you say God’s name when you’re kneeling
'Cause happiness is the destiny
And feeling this good equals success to me man
I can’t even express this fucking sentiment
It’s better than any drug I’ve ever experimented with
Better than X and it’s better than sex
And it’s better than checks the highest paid man ever collects
It’s better than an orgasm, it lasts way longer
Every song we’re on makes me stronger

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gradient]
Just know that matter how active the fools get
You don’t have to react to the bullshit
You can counteract how they’re actin’ abusive
And one day you might laugh in amusement
I been through it and I’m rappin’ the true shit
Turn the volume to the max and just lose it
Gradient and Wax on the track, and we do spit
Packin’ the room, let’s get back to the music

[Chorus x2]
