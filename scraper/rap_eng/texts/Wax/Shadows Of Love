I said that most of us are only
Playing away today
Look at us both, we're lost and lonely
No need to stay that way

I said let's spend the night together
Under the velvet sky
Losing our loneliness in pleasure
Baby, it's cold outside

She said the night's full of shadows
And shadows aren't real
They're just illusions, confusions
That lovers might feel
Under the veil of night
Right under passion's light
Forever cast by the shadows of love
Mmmm

I said we all need one another
What could be wrong with that
What could be wrong in taking cover
Even for just one night
She said a stranger's much too easy
Though it may comfort you
There's nothing but danger where it leads me
And nothing to hold onto

You see, the night's full of shadows
And shadows aren't real
They're just illusions, confusions
That lovers might feel
Under the veil of night
Right under passion's light
Forever cast by the shadows of love

'Cause night was made for you and me
So let defenses fall
Shadows fade eventually
They're only shadows after all

Under the veil of night
Right under passion's light
Forever cast by the shadows of love

She said the night's full of shadows
And shadows aren't real
They're just illusions, confusions
That lovers might feel

She said the night's full of shadows
And shadows aren't real
They're just illusions, confusions
That lovers might feel
