[Verse 1]
I wish I was a turtle
I would live life so slow
A Galápagos turtle, I mean tortoise
And I've sworn this since long ago
What did you say?
I couldn't hear your screams and shouts
Most of the time I've got my head inside my house
Yeah

[Refrain]
When I want to say hello to one of my good friends
I peek my head out, say wassup, then go back in

[Verse 2]
I wish I was a turtle
I'd never be in no rush
A Galápagos tortoise, I mean turtle
Just lurkin' around in the Galápagos
What did you say?
I couldn't hear you very well
Call me Barack Obama, I enjoy being inside Michelle
Yeah

[Refrain]
When I want to say hello to one of my good friends
I peek my head out, say wassup, then go back in

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a turtle (yeah!)
Just doing things that turtles do
Just walkin' slow and eatin' grass
And living for a really long time
It'd be like a dream come true
What did you say?
My shell is eighty percent sound proof
I wish I was a turtle and that's the
God's honest truth, ye-eh-ay

[Refrain]
When I want to say hello to one of my good friends
I peek my head out, say what's up, then go back in
