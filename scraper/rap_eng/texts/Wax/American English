Here comes my one and only
Talking like a starlet on a Hollywood screen
She whispers something to me
I hear the words but I don't know what she means

Oh, she speaks American English
Oh, don't always understand
Though she speaks American English
Got the language of love at her command

Love travels transatlantic
I'm hot and bothered by her figure of speech
Can't follow her semantics
But when her body moves it's clear to me

Oh, she speaks American English
Oh, don't always understand
Though she speaks American English
Got the language of love at her command
Hey!

Come on, yeah
Come on, yeah, woo

We don't need words
To express what is real
We've got each other
That says everything that we feel

There's too much damn confusion
With all this talking going round and round
We'll reach our own conclusion
We'll make connection on the common ground

I said
Oh, she speaks American English
Oh, don't always understand
Though she speaks American English
Got the language of love at her command

Oh, she speaks American English
Oh, don't always understand
Though she speaks American English
Got the language of love at her command
Hey!

Come on, yeah
Come on, yeah
Come on, woo

She speaks American English
She speaks the language of love
She speaks American English

She speaks American English
She speaks the language of love
She speaks American English

She speaks American English
She speaks the language of love
She speaks American English

She speaks American English
She speaks the language of love
She speaks American English
