Working girl
Pinstripe and pearls
Making your own
Way in the world

Nobody gets in your way
Nothing can stop you
Now there's nothing to tie you down

'Cause you got what you wanted
But did you get what you need
When there's nobody there to share the glory

Working girl
How will you know
(when you reach that rainbow)
Is your dream alive
If it doesn't come true
(will you win more than you lose)

Every step of the way
I was behind you
And now you don't even turn around

'Cause you got what you wanted
But did you get what you need
When there's nobody there to share the glory
Got what you wanted
But did you get what you need
When there's nobody there to share the glory

I hear you talking 'bout your high ideas
But you ain't even with me when you're here
You burnt your bridges, don't look back
'Cause I ain't gonna be there

'Cause you got what you wanted, didn't ya?
But did you get what you need
Oh, there's nobody there to share the glory

Got what you wanted, yeah, yeah
But did you get what you need
When there's nobody there to share the glory
