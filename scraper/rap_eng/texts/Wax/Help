[Intro]
Yea man, I just want to be happy
And make music
Etcetera...

[Verse 1]
Yo..
When people ask me why I do this
I stand there and appear so clueless
I don't know I just feel it in my bones
Feels like the whole world's got the last name Jones
And the music
Is an enchanting breeze
Rustling through family trees
Making them have dancing leaves
That fall off and start planting seeds
Yea..yea..
And the new ones grow
And the old ones die
And the new young flow
And they don't know why
But they grow so high
Til' they get they own spot
Tower'in up in the sky
Then they wither
And like fresh tear drops
Their seeds fall and create next year's crops
The cycle of music
Learn from the old
But we write with a new twist
As we evolve we made it
A universal language we all created
I... really think we're all related
Sibling rivalry is the cause of hatred
Never met EOM but we're peas in a pod
And the reason is god

[Hook]
Oh why...
Wrote this all by myself
But I...
But it feels like I had help

Oh why...
Wrote this all by myself
But I

But it feels like I had help

[Verse 2]
From...
This person thing or being
That they call god
Heads in the Church
They all nod
Yea.. Like we're in agreement
Facts like these don't appear in the cement
No hard truth
Just time
No hard proof
Just rhyme
No reason
Just rhythm
Season to season
We're just livin'
And we..
Wake up every morning
Equipped with the tools
Of the time we were born in
And these tools
We use
To keep building
Be-come second nature to the children
Passed down from a dad to a kid
I ain't invent the wheel
But I'm glad someone did
Cuz if they did not
Then time would just stop
There'd be no jazz
Rock'n'roll or hip-hop
But we got
Infinite sums of choices
We've come a long way
Since just drums and voices.. man
This can't be random
Too well planned for nobody to have a hand in
Never met EOM but he seems like a friend now
Digital-musical pen-pal

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Man... yea
I wrote this all myself
But it seems like I had help
Yea I wrote this by myself
But I know in my soul that I had a little help
From...
Something much bigger than me
G-o-d or whatever he be
I don't know man
I don't know fam
Freestyle gon' get with the program
No man can do it any better than me
A veteran emcee
In the place to be
I do the..
Freestyle
Dog[?] the green mile
What the suckas do
What whack mother fuckas do
Who are you to...
Try to test me
I'm cool like Nestea
You're sweet like Nestle yea..
Chocolate when I'm rockin' it..
