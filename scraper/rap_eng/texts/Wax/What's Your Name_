[Wax]
(Hook)
Hey, what's your name?
I'm so glad you came
I've been watching you

Hey, what's your name?
I'm so glad you came
I've been watching you

[Verse 1]
Oh, feeling like a stalker on stage
Feeling like I'm lost in your gaze
And I can only recall just your face
The rest of the crowd is all just a haze

It's oh so blurry
Like the middle of the winter night time snow flurry
And I'm thinking to myself, "please self don't worry."
But I hope you don't leave in a hurry, damn

The set's almost done
And the next calls a closed one
I really want to touch you and hold your curves
And tell that it makes me smile that you know the words

See, I ain't got many fans, you're one of a few
So let me buy you a drink when my strumming is through
I seen you in the crowd, I was wondering you were
I got to know for sure

(Hook)

[Verse 2]
College age maybe freshman or sophomore
Pretty young thing that I long for
Damn them lips look soft from really far
I want to know how soft they really are

I want to grab your waist in a tight embrace
And feel the warmth of your cheek rubbing against my face
God damn, I really love playing these songs
But I've never had a set that lasted this long

You make me feel like I just got out of prison
And you are the first person I've seen since free living
I can tell by the way that you move you got rhythm
Please save one dance for me?
Please give me one chance to advance my fantasy
And glide with you romantically
I got me looking at the clock so frantically
I can't let you abandon. I just want to say

(Hook)

[Refrain]
And I'm feeling so brand new
Since I took one look at you
I seen you girl and I was like
What's your name?
