[Verse 1]
The underdog never quittin' representing bi-coastal
Big Wax grab the microphone and go postal
Your cyphe seem like the ice cream social
Put them fucking cones on your head like you're supposed to
Your dunce crew gets smoked like blunts do
Once you start spitting the bullshit it just comes through
I thought you said that you was nice bruh
Name your price bruh
Put your fancy cars and your ice up
And watch your shit get gone
Into my possession then your shit gets pawned
I get applause everything you spit gets yawned upon
I got your whip on my lawn and I just listed it on
Craigslist and posted several fliers
And I already have a host of potential buyers
I do this shit tirelessly
So if you think you on a ladder rung higher than me


[Hook]
Just be advised
It'd be wise not to gamble
People in the past have tried have gotten trampled
Even when I gave them ample time to combine the beats, rhymes, and samples
Just be advised
It's just really bad timing
Especially with that simple ass rhyming
You're a grown man you can decide for yourself
But don't say I didn't offer any help
Be advised


[Verse 2]
I'm clearly the illest
Type of shit that make Arnold say "I understood you clearly Willis"
I'm strictly business I take the biggest share
Y'all strictly bitches you at the Lilith fair
Wherever I'm performing I kill it there
Eating rappers properly, napkins and silverware
Weed smoke fills the air
Everybody moves
Y'all get pelted with shoes and everybody boos
Leave welted and bruised
With your tennis shoes covered in egg yolk and tomato residues
I never lose like Biff with the almanac
So in brisk you could call it that
Talking smack when you got no chance
You should be falling back like Fat Joe doing his own dance
Your whole camp's just a bunch of little ants to protect your hills
I'd heed in the warning in advance

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't saying I'm the best
I'm just sayin' if the average emcee tried to test
And I had to make an educated guess who'd win it
I'd respond rhetorically "Have you seen a piglet fly
In the sky with a midget-high gay Jesus
On his back sayin' 'yippee-ki-yay bitches!'"
If you seen that put your money on the other quarter
Yeah that guy, the hoverboarder
I'm in the lab making custom ether
And I'm about to dump the beaker on you fucking weaker Justin Biebers
You must be into something deeper than just puffing reefer
Is it crack?
That makes you think you isn't wack?

[Hook]

[Outro]
You fucking pitiful morons
You fucking miniscule humans
I was better than you as a middle school student
You ain't shit
And ain't never gon' be shit
Your mom ain't shit
Your dad wasn't shit
And their parents weren't shit neither
I spit ether
The grim reaper
No question
No contestin'
Big Wax
Clockwise
