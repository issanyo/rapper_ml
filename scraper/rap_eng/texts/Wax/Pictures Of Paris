Right bank left bank
Two troubled souls on a starry French night
She goes he stays
All on his own in the city of lights

All that he's left with are pictures of Paris
Memories of her on the Champs Elysees
Trashing his life on the sidewalks of Paris

She said love's dead
She walks away as he sits there in shame
Gets drunk, heart sunk
Watching his dreams as they float down the Seine

All that he's left with are pictures of Paris
Memories of her on the Champs Elysees
Trashing his life on the sidewalks of Paris

Cafes soirees
He should feel happy but now its all wrong
Bells peel but now he feels more like
The Hunchback of Notre Dame

All that he's left with are pictures of Paris
Memories of her on the Champs Elysees
Trashing his life on the sidewalks of Paris

East side West side
Back in New York he is hungry and wet
Last chance romance
Pictures of Paris are all he has left
Maybe
