I wish I was your phone
I wish I was your phone
I'd always be by your side and you'd never leave me alone
If I was your phone

I wish I was your screen
I wish I was your iPhone screen
You'd look at me like I was the greatest thing you'd ever seen
If I was your screen

I wish I was your case
I wish I was your iPhone case
You would hold me oh so tight in that loving warm embrace
If I was your case

But I'm just a guy, I don't get wifi
And I'm not made by Apple, I'm not an iGuy
I just wish I could connect with you
The way that you and that damn telephone do

I wish I was your phone
I wish I was your phone
But you dropped me and you broke me and you left me all alone
Forgot about our love and brought that newer model home
And he's faster and he's smarter and he's got facial recognition
Fuck you and your phone
