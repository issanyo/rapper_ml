[Chorus]
I been living in this city for a long while
Sometimes I feel like I just need to slow down
I'm packing up a bag I'm 'bout to roll out
Headed back to my hometown
'Bout to take a little trip to my hometown

[Verse 1: Intuition]
When I left it was big city dreaming
Traded tall trees for the cement
Traded calm peace for the steep rent
Cold for the beach
But still head to mom's street for the reset
Run to the midnight
Sun gon' get right
Me and my little bruh probably gon' fist fight
And I don't have shit to do
My dad sick we listen to his music on the couch
With the dog
And just sit tight
I lived life
Where B.B. gun fights
Hide and seek be fun nights
Where the lakes stay freezy and the skeeters gon' bite
Where your high school sweetie might complete your love life
Where shit talkers get beat up so you keep your tongue tight
Been known to take a long walk down a dirt road
And think about the glow the world shows after first snows
Rave in the backyard
Where the red fern grows
I wasn't made to stay here
I'm glad I had a turn though

[Chorus]
I been living in this city for a long while
Sometimes I feel like I just need to slow down
I'm packing up a bag I'm 'bout to roll out
Headed back to my hometown
'Bout to take a little trip to my hometown

[Verse 2: Wax]
I watched a lot of television as a teen
I used to see the screen as a window to a dream
I wanted to be in it but so far away it seemed
Had to leave my native land like Semmi and Akeem
Moved myself to the west
Put myself to the test
Lots of ups and downs
Lots of failures and success
I'm a grown man now I think I'm changing for the best
I used to want it all now I'm tryna want less
I visit my hometown looking for some relaxation
And every time I find a whole lot of inspiration
Via conversations I had with a lot of good friends
That do not look at life through no Hollywood lens
And I probably would've been a different person if I'd stayed there
Working 9 to 5 to afford the cost of daycare
But, I was put on this Earth for something different
I'd never move back but I'd love to fucking visit

[Chorus]
I been living in this city for a long while
Sometimes I feel like I just need to slow down
I'm packing up a bag I'm 'bout to roll out
Headed back to my hometown
'Bout to take a little trip to my hometown

[Outro: Wax]
It's just hard to be at a barbecue and not drink man. It's like watching pornography for hours on end and just not touching yourself at all

[Audio Snippet]
You'll find yourself getting upset or irritated about things that usually don't irritate you, you know? Things that never bothered you when you were drinking every day, so... it's normal, it's part of it. Just try to relax and breathe and try to you know, just blow it off
