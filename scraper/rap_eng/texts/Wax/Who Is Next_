Watching the cars go by...

Postage stamp, box in hand
Cargo to send, different land
For the good all the best
Cargo sent. Who is next yeah
Who is next yeah

I'm just looking for something to do
Something new to waste some time
It seems everything and everyone
Are all too serious, they forgot about fun
So I'll just stand here and wait

Postage stamp, box in hand
Cargo to send, different land
For the good all the best
Cargo sent. Who is next yeah
Who is next yeah

Nothing going go on tonight
So I think I'll take a drive
I could really use the change
But even the road's looking the same
Some new places, some new names
When am I getting there?
Stagnation is everywhere
Every,every,everywhere

So I'll just sit and wait
