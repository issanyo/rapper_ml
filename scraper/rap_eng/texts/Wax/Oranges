Shout outs to now
Live in the moment

I'm an asshole, orifice
Sticking it in like an engorged dick, or a fist
I'm on stage performing Origins
While I got people heckling saying wait what Oranges?
So I run with it like fourth and inches
Since I'm trying to go from small to big like sorting dishes
Barely can afford a kitchen
So I scrub the floors with chlorine up to my ears to get a clear portrait image
I see you trying to get ahead with having your quarters flipped
And half the time I'm getting head like a quarter flip
So who's working harder?
The one getting blown by a gorgeous chick
Or the one blowing half of their profits in bowls and spliffs
Throw nothing but strikeouts and I can't bowl for shit
You got drive? I'm jumping in your lane, knock over four of the pins
And if you check the scoreboard I even scored more than you did
Legen-wait for it-the kid from Derry dropping that oo ish
There's Jay-Z you're JayB, what a blueprint
Starting a hot movement, add some coolant
But then get rear-ended like dingleberrys off of nudists
(pause) I mean fender benders like new guitar students
That leads me to Indiana Jones getting ruined
Welcome to the jungle, stomach rumbling got something Bruin
But always have the upper hand, I'm flushing out all of the new shit
So I'm an asshole, orifice
Sticking it like an engorged dick, or a fist
I'm on stage performing Origins
While I got people heckling saying wait what Oranges?
