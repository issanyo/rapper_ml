[Intro]
Yeah. My man Elements of Music
He just sent me a little new shit
So I had to tell him how I deal with shit check it

[Verse 1]
Pardon the cliche but I tend to keep it real
So if I tell you something then it's probably how I feel
But some people that I deal with do it way different
Changing, colors Shape shifting
They adjust to their surroundings
And bring to the table whatever that certain crowd brings
How they talk how they act
Watch what you tell them 'cause they quick to stab you in the back
So they best left kept away
You'll end up saying damn it felt like we was best friends yesterday
They terrible homies great snitches
Lawyers love em cause they always make a great witness
On the stand they be giving up the Judas speech
Putting it all out there like they on a nudist beach
Ain't nothing that they loyal to
Look out for them don't let them foil you

[Chorus]
I'ma watch what you say to me
Cause you not what you claim to be
Is that your real hair and your real skin?
Beware the chameleon, uh
Beware the chameleon, yeah
Beware the chameleon
Is that your real hair and your real skin?
Beware the chameleon (Yeah)


[Verse 2]
People in love can be easily deceived
'Cause love requires trust so the other people needs to be believed
But some will readily betray it
Tell a lie and not feel guilty as they say it
The manipulative type trying to get what they like
They got they flipping game tight so they gratin' the fight male or female
Either way no sympathy
They both do it they just do it a little differently
A man's blinded by hard sex and large breasts
A woman's blinded by cars, jets, and large checks
A man cheating is probably fucking with random whores
A woman cheating is probably fucking a friend of yours
She'll smile at you when she come in the house
Watch out she might got some cum in her mouth so don't kiss her
As soon as possible dismiss her
And take it as a lesson next time you'll get the picture
It's the truth man

[Chorus]
I'ma watch what you say to me
Cause you not what you claim to be
Is that your real hair and your real skin?
Beware the chameleon, uh
Beware the chameleon, yeah
Beware the chameleon
Is that your real hair and your real skin?
Beware the chameleon (Uh)

[Verse 3]
On the other end of the lizard spectrum
Is the hollywood networker always trying to kiss your rectum
Only friends with those who can connect him
And they understand the game it's hard to respect them
It's real easy to spot this dummy
When you talk to him say a joke that's not that funny
If they burst into way too much laughter
Then they own personal gain's what they after
But i don't treat them with hostility
I just treat them like they speaking in soliloquy
The female ones they be killing me
Bitch you just trying to fuck Ryan Phillipe
Get up out the dressing room
It's Big Wax EOM if you guessing whom
It's why the shit bump like a pregnant womb
Good night kids another lesson coming soon

[Chorus]
I'ma watch what you say to me
'Cause you not what you claim to be
Is that your real hair and your real skin?
Beware the chameleon, uh
Beware the chameleon, yeah
Beware the chameleon
Don't let them take care of your children
Beware the chameleon
