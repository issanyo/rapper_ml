[Intro: Wax]
Wax and Herbal T!
Lack of Afro!
Fly with us, y'all!

C'mon! (x6)
Yeah!
C'mon! (x6)
Yo!

[Chorus: Wax & Herbal T]
Tilt your beer up, pass the dro
We about to
Put the gear in the bags and go
We on a world wide vagabond travel show
It's Big Wax! Herbal T! International!
We international, international
With a passion for actin' irrational
When we combined with the band with the Lack of Fro
We make the track oh-so international

[Verse 1: Herbal T]
Ni hao as-salamu alaykum konnichi wa
Herbal T number 1, ein uno ichiban
International visionary, travelin' the globe
Spreadin' my gospel like a missionary
But the sermon we preach to the word in the beats
Make the world lose control of the nerves in they feet
'Til they dancin' in the streets from Belize to Greece
Every promenade
Rio de Janeiro to Islamabad
L.A.X. to Honolulu I fly high
In the sky from NY to Uruguay
Algeria, now Syria, no criteria
Nigeria up to Siberia
To Bangladesh
Like an anaconda in the Amazon
You start to feel the beat strangle your flesh
'Til you fail to breathe, cuz your lungs collapse
'Cause you heard mister of Lack of Afro
Bring it back like this

[Chorus: Wax & Herbal T]
C'mon! (x6)
Yeah!
C'mon! (x6)
Yo!
Tilt your beer up, pass the dro
We about to
Put the gear in the bags and go
We on a world wide vagabond travel show
It's Big Wax! Herbal T! International!
We international, international
With a passion for actin' irrational
When we combined with the band with the Lack of Fro
We make the track oh-so international

[Verse 2: Wax]
We got beats from Brittan and trees from North Cali
The flows the North Pole, the lyrics is Death Valley
The originality's an inscription in an Egyptian tomb
We've been sick since we was kids in the womb
To whom it may concern
We gotta plane to catch and Mary Jane to burn
We gotta day confirmed, off the tour, Belgium!
The crowd says, "Thank you."
We holler, "You're welcome."
Play this jam at the Palace of Buckingham
Watch all of the guards break into The Running Man
The Southern Man loves it for the guitar
In India they remixed the a cappella with the sitar
Catch me and Herbs at the Amsterdam strip bar
Or Japan or Thailand or Zanzibar
Yeah!
This happens to be a classic
Catch us on the cover of National Geographic

[Verse 5: Herbal T]
In the Kongo playing jembes and bongos
With dudes related to Dikembe Mutombo
Catch a plane pronto, fly to Toronto, Ontario
Lack of Afro in your stereo

[Verse 6: Wax]
A-yo!
Dunny we ball from Nepal to Senegal
The off the wall raw that the world ain't never saw
We level all the already disheveled walls
Between genres then lounge in the Bahamas

[Chorus]
Tilt your beer up, pass the dro
We about to
Put the gear in the bags and go
We on a world wide vagabond travel show
It's Big Wax! Herbal T! International!
We international, international
With a passion for actin' irrational
When we combined with the band with the Lack of Fro
We make the track oh-so international

Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah (x5)
Whoa oh oh oh
Yeah (x5)

[Verse 7: Wax & Herbal T]
Yeah~
We hikin', we trekkin'
And we got no time for half-steppin'
No rest tonight, we 'bout to catch a flight
So prepare for the ride of your life
We going all the way to
Pennsylvania! Albania! Scandinavia! Saudi Arabia!
Ethiopia! Cambodia! Macedonia! Southern California!
D.C! Fiji! Tahiti! Vancouver, B.C.!

Every nation! Every capital!
Big Wax! Herbal T! International!

Big Wax! Herbal T! International! (x3)
