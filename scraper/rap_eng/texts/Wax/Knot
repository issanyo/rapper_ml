There was this little knot
It found a home somewhere to be
It burrowed deep inside
Almost as if it snuggled right up to me

And I can't keep it down

There was this branch
That seemed to stick right out of me
Not a whole tree or nothing
Just a knot, a knot tied up in me

And I can't keep it down
No more...

The branch has bent its way
The weight has cut the slack
Hang, hang. Hangin' from it
You just can't turn your back
