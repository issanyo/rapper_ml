[Verse 1]
My construction worker homie bumps this in his shitty car
On the way to spend his paycheck at the titty bar
I ain't there yet but I've come pretty far
Shout out to my homie Dumb
This is pandemonium
I command a podium with presidential stature
Capture the audience then get a medal after
Get my dick sucked by Lewinsky-looking interns
Hotter women give the T friction till my skin burns
They don't think they need to do it right
Due to heightened senses of entitlement
Who they like
Like rappers who step through the mic mic
Who said you was tight?
I'd recommended that you would've gone and flew a kite
My flow's not really very human-like
It's more the something-you-would-see-when-you-was-shroomin' type
A colorful array
When they ask how I did it this is what I'm gon' say:

[Hook]
It's automatic
Automatic E
Automatic E
OM I'm goin' in yo

[Verse 2]
As far as rappers that be really spittin' proper flows
There's not many in the game like soccer goals
My music touch souls like Dr. Scholls
Easy pass y'all real fast while you stop for tolls
The Oscar goes to you real life impostor trolls
Whether for your positive personas or your mobster roles
Yeah, that shit sounds very fake
Tryna be something it ain't like Salisbury Steak
If you gave 'em truth serum they'd be like
"Wax, I don't wanna be in the booth near him"
That'd be kinda like... stepping right into the fire
Wrong place wrong time like a typo on a flier
You are easily exposed like Mardi Gra titties
You little and you plastic like Barbie doll titties
I tell women in the crowd "show me all of y'all's titties"
And they bouncin'
Me and EOM is in the house and

[Hook]
It's automatic
Automatic E
Automatic E
Check it out
Yo

[Verse 3]
I ain't gotta prove nothing I just point to the scorecard
Nice like your momma when you got a good report card
At the sports bar sippin' Seagram's 7 with a bunch of drunk lesbians call 'em Ellen Degenerates
Fifty percent of y'all can tell I'm the cleverest
The rest of y'all would be awesome selling some beverages like
"Cold beer! Cold beer!"
I be like "Oh yeah? Pass me one over here!"
You are smaller than an isotope
In order to see you I'd have to take a picture of you through a microscope
Then take a picture of that picture through a microscope
Then take a picture of that picture through a microscope
Then take a...
You get the picture
The picture is the picture of the picture's picture's picture
The picture will be different if the picture was your sister
She a fat heifer that never fit into the picture

[Hook]
It's automatic
Automatic E
Automatic E
OM I'm goin' in uh
