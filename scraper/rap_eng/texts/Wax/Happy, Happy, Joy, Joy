Hello, boys and girls, this is your old pal Stinky Wizzleteats
This is a song about a whaleâ€”
No!
This is a song about being happy
That's right!
It's the Happy Happy Joy Joy song!

I don't think you're happy enough
That's right!
I'll teach you to be happy
I'll teach your grandmother to suck eggs
Now, boys and girls, let's try it again

Happy Happy Joy Joy

If'n you ain't the granddaddy of all liars
The little critters of nature
They don't know that they're ugly
That's very funny!
A fly marrying a bumblebee!
I told you I'd shoot!
But you didn't believe me
Why didn't you believe me?
