Won't you twist my arm so seductively
And lead me to where we can breathe
You can take it piece by piece til I'm open
I can slide my shoes against the curb
Like I'm doing something neat in my head
To let us in...but it's a secret

I'm torn in two and three and four
And if you want I'll count some more
Five and six, pick up bricks
And step on over...over my head

You can take it piece by piece if you want
People take what they want
They take and take and give to take some more
My arms seem so long, thank goodness for pockets
Hide me so far down, til I'm not here

I'm torn in two and three and four
And if you want I'll count some more
Five and six, pick up bricks
And step on over, over my head
