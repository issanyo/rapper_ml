We gettin' lo-fi, low budget
So fly, so rugged
We gon' do this shit until we both die so fuck it
When in the lab, we just don't play
(?) that motherfucker like every day
Stay stay on that grizzly bizzly
Getting rid of the mimicry that we visibly witnessing every day
Y'all motherfuckers thought we slack with this music
Well think again bitch we back with this new shit
Packed with exclusive
Tracks that is ruthless
And make emcees wanna smack their producers
Fire them ducks and hire some trucks
To come and run over them schmucks and their flyers and such
Until the tires crush all their mic wires and such
It's Big Wax, Herbal T
Man we flyer than fuck
Bitch
We so gifted
So lifted
It's impossible for us not to rip shit
We burning cats to the third degree
It's Big Wax, Herbal T
