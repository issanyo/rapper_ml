[Verse 1 - Wax]
Sitting on a park bench on the D Low
Feeling like Clark Kent's alter-ego
Throwing out bread smidgens
To the eager-to-be-fed pigeons
I could loaf around, laugh all day
But unless I got another loaf around, they fly away
I wish that I could fly too
I'd fly to a lake and sit in somebody's canoe
I wouldn't care if it were strapped with no oars
Cause I'd be in no rush to make it back to the shore
I'm not an athletic specimen
But I can float with the best of them
People tend to act real pushy
But you can't put a strain on my brain, it's too mushy
I just recline in the sun
Stumble through life until my time is done
Cause I-

[Hook]
Don’t need no palace paved with gold
Don’t need more cash than banks can hold

[Verse 2 - Fiyablasta]
Watching cars zoom as I walk to my tunes
In a world of my own that you'll learn about soon
The crowd I impress are ducks, squirrels, and 'squitos
The fame and the fortune? Nah, I don't need those
Give me an iPod and my bars will make you say, "My God!"
At least I thought until some dogs bark
Startled, but I laugh it off. Look back at the passing cars
Then to make it better I trip on the slanted sidewalk
Wow, SMH!
Then the shame fades away jamming to the bass
At the stoplight, dancing like I'm trying to get the spotlight
People know if I don't have headphones, something's not right
Walk light comes on, I check both ways
Drivers see me lip syncing to every single song that plays
I don't care if they claim that that boy cray
Cause I know those who wave would agree when I say
I-

[Verse 3 - Wax]
You can catch me on a playground swing
Back and forth smilin' doing my thing
Passers-by often color me dumb
But I don't care man, I'm comfortably numb
They looking at me real strangely
But their perceptions don't change me
I bet if I jumped at the right trajectory
I'd fly right over them and land in a special seat
On the crest of the moon with a fishing pole
Cast in the earth in some distant hole
Pull up a catfish I wouldn't gut it
I would play with it, and love it
I'm sorry for the hole that spanned your lip
A small price for good old companionship
Loneliness is a mountain, a massive climb
I'm on the other side, happy, just passing time

[Hook]
