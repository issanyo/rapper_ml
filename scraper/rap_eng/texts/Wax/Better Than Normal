[Intro]
Much like that plane that you can kinda hear
In the faint distance in the sky
I used to always be high
I used to smoke a lot of weed, y'all
A lot of weed I used to smoke
And I still do partake, I still partake in marihuana
But I don't smoke like I used to, man
And I've come to find out that when you don't smoke all the time
You enjoy it more when you do, you know
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder
And I think that's also true of weed
So the other day, the other day I was high
And kinda feelin' the vibe and I wrote this little song
It's like a little ode to bein' high

[Chorus]
I hear the bees buzzing more than they normally buzz
I feel the sun shining stronger than it normally does
I think the roses smell better than they normally do
'Cause everything seems better than normal when I'm with you

[Verse 1]
I think the seats seem more comfortable when youÂ´re in my car
And the red lights seem way shorter than they normally are
The other drivers smile more often than they normally do
'Cause everything seems better than normal when I'm with you

[Bridge]
But now my only issue
Is when you're gone things are a bit off
Like when I go to sleep not with you
My mattress does not seem as soft

[Chorus]
I hear the bees buzzing more than they normally buzz
I feel the sun is shining stronger than it normally does
I think that the roses smell better than they normally do
Yeah, yeah
'Cause everything seems better than normal when I'm with
-thing seems better than normal when I'm with
-thing seem better than normal when I'm with you
