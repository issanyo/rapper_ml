[Verse 1]

We, unidentified flying object
Ya'll volcanic grade five science project
What are they smokin'
Oh how I loathe them
I'm the motherfucker that eats the butter after your stomach churns
Straight no chaser chuggin' rappers 'til my gullet burns
What a foul mannered guest, yes
Take a minute out of your busy schedule to compare
Then put your cap back on and go sit back in your dunce chair
And have fun there
Embodying the sentiment that god's unfair
Snatch the mic so fast from your freakin' arm
That the meat rips and your hands look like chicken parm'
Make a little sandwich
Have it on a french roll, bagel or a bandage

[Hook]

We're eating all your food
We're treating ya'll so rude
We're bad company
Well well
We're beating on your door
We're sleeping on your floor
We're bad company

[Verse 2]

My man E should be gettin' like thirty G's
Every time that he's on the boards like QWERTY keys
Turkey please
The cold lamp make your whole camp all surely freeze
"Purty please" rappers saying as they're down on their dirty knees
Begging for one slice of mercy cheese
We lead 'em to the mouse trap
One sweet taste and the bar comes down, splat
Lay you out flat like a lie
To disrespect your whole mom, that type of guy
Ya'll g-n-a-t, gnat type of fly
We're the type of fly from the movie The Fly
We're supafly
The human eye is too slow to scrutinize
Especially when your brain came in extra small stupid size
You freakin' moron you
We've been hocking loogies in your chicken cordon bleu
Timmy

[Hook]
We're eating all your food
We're treating ya'll so rude
We're bad company
Well well
We're beating on your door
We're sleeping on your floor
We're bad company

[Verse 3]

You could reside in the north, or live in the south
It don't matter where you live, we gon' visit your house
Stage dive off your table, mosh pit on the couch
When we kitchen crowd surfing you'll be kicked in the mouth
When the freakin' brown bourbon we be sippin' runs out
Every single down person in my clique will run out
Cause we all know what time it is
It's time to set fire to your mama's crib
Ya dummy

[Hook]
We're eating all your food
We're treating ya'll so rude
We're bad company
Well well
We're beating on your door
We're sleeping on your floor
We're bad company
