Whenever your shadow falls
On stony ground
And there's not a hand for you to hold
Whenever the dreams you dream
Come crashing down

Every time you think of home
Remember that you're not alone
And we'll be with you heart and soul
Wherever you are

And if you should lose your path along the way
And find yourself walking in the dark
Whenever the ones you love seem far away

Every time you think of home
Remember that you're not alone
And we'll be with you heart and soul
Wherever you are

(sail on home...)
Some are lost and some are lonely
Drifting away but they are only
Reaching out for love to hold onto
(sail on home...)
Mother father sister brother
Giving strength to one another
Guide them where the healing waters flow

Every time you think of home
Remember that you're not alone
And we'll be with you heart and soul
Wherever you are
