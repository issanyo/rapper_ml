[Intro]
Check it out
We came to

[Chorus]
Party
Party
Party
Party

[Verse 1]
Check it out yo, yo
While you aim to maintain a status quo
A body with a sign of an average joe
Me and uncle C and a lack of flow
[?] to know, we international
Reiterate in case you're a little late
I incinerate fakes on my dinner plate
We hungry
[?]gon' starve the hardest
I can see [?] on the mic and get stupid

[Chorus]
Party
Party
Party
Party

[Verse 2]
Learn to be original
Erb's an individual
Nerves a typical hypocritical
[?] minimal impact
Can skip the back brake
Hard work it takes to get to that place
Where you can get whatever you want and still kill it
Pass that prescription bottle and we'll fill it
[?] music from the [?]
[?]

[Chorus]
Party
Party
Party
Party

[Bridge]
Check it out
Check it out
We came to
Check it out
Check it out
Not uh

[Chorus]
Party
Party
Party
Party

[Bridge]
Check it out
Check it out
We came to
Check it out
Check it out
Not uh

We came to party
