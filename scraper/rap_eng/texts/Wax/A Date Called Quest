We on award tour with EOM my man
Going each and every place with the mic in my hand
So can I kick it ? Yes he can
Can I kick it ? Yes he can
Big Wax and EOM represent represent
And it's a Tribe Called Quest represent represent
When the mic is in my hand I represent my squad
My favorite jam back in the day was oh my god

[Verse 1: Wax]
Now listen up everybody, the bottom line
The night is on my mind but the sun is still shining
Riding on the train with no dough and it sucks
Buggin' out in my mind thinkin' about how to get some bucks
When I saw this cute female
Ass was kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
Young girl desires started fillin' my mind
If there's one thing I've learned
Its good girls are hard to find
So I had to act as if I had more game than parker brothers
And I walked over to her feeling smooth like butter
I said hola chicka, so nice to meet ya'
I asked for her name, she said, Bonita, Bonita
I said you got to put me on, I had a crush on her
Like if she was John from NPO, she needs a mighty good man
When I asked if we could kick it she said yes we can

[Verse 2: Wax]
Man
She had caught my heart for the evening
And we agreed to meet up that weekend
Saturday came I was ready to go like lyrics
So here is the scenario
Resturanto "El Segundo" I forgot the name
When she came inside, I said I'm glad you came
She was lookin' stressed out, I said I know how you feel
But everything wasn't fair when we finished the meal
Pay for this pay for that, pay for food and beer
Who the hell you think I am? Mr. Belvedere? Damn
But when I tried to dissipate her laugh
I just pulled out my wallet an' gave the waiter the cash
And when I looked at her it really didn't matter
Cause all I could see was hot sex on a platter
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
So when she made small talk I just couldn't relate

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wax]
We went back to her crib later on that night
I needed to freak but I was feeling up tight
She said 'relax, please settle down
We bout to knock the boots, like the group "H-Town"
She got me an E on the bedroom wall
I thought I had it all covered like a female shawl
I could bust off on her bed and give her a seaman's mattress
But I won't do that cause I got crazy prophylactics
Next step get the jimmy hat
So I can do dat, do dat, do do, dat dat dat
I reached into my pocket, to pull out my wallet
And realized damn at "El Segundo" I forgot it
Absent minded is the way I am
So I had to yeah yeah to the K.I.M
I went home passed out, and when I woke up
I just did my thing solo like when tribe broke up
Yeah
