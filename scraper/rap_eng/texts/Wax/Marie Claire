Well you did what you had to do
When your back's to the wall what else can you do
And you're pushed just a little too far
Now the heat is on, and here you are

Well I waited my life for you
I said I'd always be there no matter what you do
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
And if that's where you want me, then that's where I'll be

Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire
I know there's a place for us somewhere
We'll be together now
Find our way out somehow
Your secret's safe with me I swear
Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire

Well you never gave me a chance
To be more than a victim of circumstance
Now I find myself lying for you
And I'll do anything that you want me to

I don't care if it's right or wrong
I don't care who the world tries to blame this on
You're the one thing that's right in my life
And I can't let you turn me away tonight

Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire
I know there's a place for us somewhere
We'll be together now
Find our way out somehow
Your secret's safe with me I swear
Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire
