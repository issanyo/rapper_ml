[Intro: Wax]
Girl you got me on a whole new wavelength
On a different realm of space and time

[Verse 1]
I thought that I had permanently lost the capacity
I thought I carried too much bullshit from my past with me
I thought I'd never love another woman passionately
But you had to get me thinking otherwise
Of the lies I've told myself have been debunked
And my old methodology is now defunct
I got skunked for awhile now I caught a fish
Driving slow on the love boat talking ish something like

[Chorus]
Never thought I'd be in love again
Never thought I'd be in love again

[Verse 2]
I thought that fire in my soul was put out by pain
And there was no woman alive who could ignite that flame
But you took that little torch and you scorched it with ease
Like the first ever olympian in ancient Greece
Goddess Hera of the modern era
I don't wanna share you with nobody ever
Your love will never miss
No Chubby Checker Twist
It's no trouble, effortless
On a London double decker bus
Upper level kiss
Gimme that

[Chorus]
Never thought I'd be in love again
Never thought I'd be in love again

[Bridge]
In the days of my youth I was trippin' off that feeling of awe-struck infatuation
I thought it was a passing phase
But ever since I laid my eyes on you babe
It's like I'm back to the golden days

[Chorus]
Never thought I'd be in love again
Never thought I'd be in love again

[Spoken outro: Jarren Benton]
