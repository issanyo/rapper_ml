[Verse 1: Wax]
She was such a pretty girl and she was mine for a couple of years
And on the day that she walked away I guess I shed a couple of tears
But from what I understand, she's now having the time of her life
I guess its true what Too Short said, that you can't turn a ho into a housewife

[Hook x2]
'Coz she's so fine she used to be mine
Now she fucks two dudes at a time
She was so good, we was in love
But I guess one dick wasn't enough

[Verse 2: Wax]
At first I couldn't believe it
She was so sweet and so kind
How could she be getting ass-fucked and sucking dick at the same time?
But I went online one day and I saw that shit firsthand
She was having a one-night stand with a
A nine piece salsa band
And the piano player is fucking her asshole
And in her pussy hole is the bass
She's got the backup singer's dick in each hand
And the trumpet player's fucking her face
And her toes are doing some tickling on the rest of the horn section's balls
The percussion players jerking off on the side
While the lead singer's telling the studio n' audience to applause

[Hook x2]
'Coz she's so fine she used to be mine
Now she fucks two dudes at a time
She was so good, we was in love
But I guess one dick wasn't enough

[Verse 3: Wax]
Now the band started getting excited
They were all about to bust nuts
It was nine Puerto Rican musicians
And just one little asian slut
Now every square inch of her body
Is totally soaked with cum
And if you ask the bitch what two plus two was
She wouldn't even know 'coz she's too fucking dumb

[Hook x2]
She's so fine she used to be mine
Now she fucks nine dudes at a time
She was so good, we was in love
But I guess eight dicks wasn't enough

Eight dicks wasn't enough!
