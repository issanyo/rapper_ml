[Verse 1]
Jesus Christ had a crazy dad
He drowned people when He got mad
He gave a son who was really young
The only one that He ever had
Now His son's name had that special thing
Somethin' about it just had that ring
Now it's the name that I exclaim
When I'm feelin' bad about anything

[Chorus]
I say Jesus Christ, 'cause that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain
Jesus Christ, that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain
When I slam my finger in a car door
And I feel that sudden burst of pain
I say Jesus Christ, 'cause that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain

[Verse 2]
The Mormons don't know shit
Their prophet's name is Joe Smith
If I had to take a name in vain
That is not the one that I'd go with
Now the name Muhammad is awesome
But watch out if you draw him
I'm scared as shit of the terrorists
So I don't say his name when I'm talkin'

[Chorus]
I say Jesus Christ, 'cause that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain
Jesus Christ, that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain
When I throw my controller against the wall
'Cause I lost my favorite video game
I say Jesus Christ, 'cause that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain

[Verse 3]
Now Buddha is peaceful
Got love for all his people
So when I choose his name to use
It's a slang term for [?]
There's Martin Luther and Moses
And whoever the pope is
But when I'm hurt then I need to blurt
The only name that I know is

[Chorus]
Jesus fuckin' Christ, that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain
Jesus Christ, that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain
When my ex-girlfriend calls me up
And says her period never came
I say Jesus Christ, 'cause that's the name
That's the name I wanna take in vain

[Verse 4]
When I slam my finger in a cupboard
I don't say L. Ron Hubbard
It hurts like a bitch, bruh
I don't scream out Hare Krishna, hey
I don't even really know what Hare Krishna did
Or what is historical significance is

[Outro]
That's for all my 80s rap fans
