Verse 1:
They call me Big Wax aka Michael Jones
They say I make the type of music that you feel in your bones
They say something happens every time I rock microphones
That puts all the fly bitches in their comfort zones
They get moister and moister
Circling the pearl like the world is your oyster
As I get more boisterous
She gets more and more poise to bust
Intense Imagination really ain't no choice but us

[Hook]
It goes: goodnight
Yeah, sleep tight

Verse 2:
You can catch me out in Cali'
Like your boy was a palm tree
We're in the vicinity of wherever your mom be
Probably got her at my house doing my laundry
Bitch does a good job, it comes out so softly
She be folding my pants
While she water my plants
She like to dance butt-naked in a three point stance
She's such a slutty undresser
Tell her to fuck she says "Yes, sir"
But her weight fluctuates like the Nutty Professor

[Hook]
I tell her goodnight
Yeah (Mrs. Klump), sleep tight

Verse 3:
I found my self out in Los Angeles
Y'all ain't ever found shit
You're just lost and jealous
I ball some like Martha
And y'all the Vandellas
Y'all be like "let's do whatever the boss man tell us!"
I'm the baddest of the bad
The raddest of the rad
I'm the worst nightmare that your dad has ever had
Cause your mom don't miss him
She low-key diss him
Cause he tastes my balls every time she kiss him
Saying

[Hook]
Goodnight
Yeah, sleep tight

Verse 4:
I'm way above anybody in this musical genre
I just blew on some ganja
Then flew on Lufthansa
Mid-flight fuck the beautiful stewardess Sandra
So when I say a mile high
That's a quadruple entendre, count 'em
I'm a barbarian
You a librarian
I'm taking kids out like doctors do on cesareans
You're chances are very slim
If a rapper steps up I will bury him
He should watch where he swims the wrong aquarium
This is the shark tank
Go back to the koi pond
Where the little baby guppy girls and boys bond
Yeah, I don't respond to them
I just keep on talking about your mom again
Cause she be sucking my dick
And licking my balls
And she don't stop licking until she get an applause
And when I'm about to bust a nut she sit up and pause
The bitch looking like the shark in the picture from Jaws
She Like..
Knaw'mean?
Turn it up loud like radio Raheem
Wanna do the right thing when It comes to your spouse?
Better tell that bitch stay in the house (house)
I tell her

[Hook]
Goodnight
Yeah, sleep tight
- And we out
