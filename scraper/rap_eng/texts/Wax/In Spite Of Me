In spite of me you'd be kinda neat
Strong feeling you'd be unreal to me
In spite of me you'd live on my street
You'd be great to meet

Despite me you're everything
I'd want to see
I'd want to see in me...
Just to be

In spite of me the visions you must see
Think would be clearer without me
Think you might say, to me...
One day just go away, the longest day
