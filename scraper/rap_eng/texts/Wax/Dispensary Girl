[Hook]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
I think I'm in love again
Oh, oh-OH-oh
She gives me my medicine and we, was meant to be
She works at the dispensary, and every time I
See her she gets me oh so high!

[Verse 1]
Yo
I had a really bad day
It was a downer
I walk into the place hoping my girl's behind the counter
When they buzz me in
I got my finger's crossed
I smell kush in the air and heard
Some weird music like Sigur RÃ³s
I'm flabbergasted when I entered the spot
Cause I seen my girl before and she was never this hot
And I know I'm gonna spend a lot of time picking weed up today!

She got me singing like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo
She got a smile so healthy
Attitude: mellow
No need to sell me
She had me at "Hello"
With the little black dress on, her skin just glows
Jamaican flag rings on her index toes
When it comes to weed knowledge, she's kind of a diva
Well-versed in the new kind of sativa
I'm a believer
She THC to my mind everytime I see her!
I be screamin'...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
There couldn't be a better day
To pick up an eighth
It gets me so high looking at your pretty face
I wish you would say, you want to be mine

[Verse 2]
Ayo, She so positive
Always in a fun mood
Ass kinda thick
She probably eats a lot of junk food
I ain't just some dude
I'm that one dude you been looking for
You ain't gotta look no more
We can get high, lay around and cook some smores
To describe.. you, I'd need a good Thesaurus
Because there ain't enough words I've learned thus far
To tell you how beautiful you are
Girl, you got me like...

[Hook]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
I think I'm in love again
Oh, oh-OH-oh
She gives me my medicine and we, was meant to be
She works at the dispensary, and every time I
See her she gets me oh so high!

[Adlibs]
Girl
You look so good to me
And everytime I be in the
Di-spen-sa-ry
You got me going crazy
You look... so nice...
I wanna eat you up
Like a bowl of rice...
