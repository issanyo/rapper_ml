There's something about the way that
You look at me when I tell you that I love you
It's nothing but a blank stare
And I'm trying not to think that
You'll soon be leaving me

What happened girl?
I thought we was happy girl
And we would get married girl

You 'bout to take the coldest steps

I know you leaving me
You don't wanna be with me
But you'll do it so easily

You 'bout to take the coldest steps

What happened to me and you against the world
Let's stay together girl
I thought this was forever girl

You 'bout to take the coldest steps

I know you trippin' out
And you feel like dippin' out
I think I'm flippin' out

You 'bout to take the coldest steps

Oh I hear it in your voice
You 'bout to take the coldest steps

There's something about the way that
You look at me and stutter as if you're lying
And I'm trying to believe you
But your style is so see-through
What happened to your innocence?

What happened girl?
I thought we was happy girl
And we would get married girl

You 'bout to take the coldest steps

I know you leaving me
You don't wanna be with me
But you'll do it so easily

You 'bout to take the coldest steps

What happened to me and you against the world
Let's stay together girl
I thought this was forever girl

You 'bout to take the coldest steps

I know you trippin' out
And you feel like dippin' out
I think I'm flippin' out

You 'bout to take the coldest steps

So many tears we've cried together
Baby, baby
But we've always worked it out
And I, said I remember yeah
How we used to walk and we'd talk
About any little thing we was thinking about

Baby gotta tell me what you think about me
