[Intro]
If you only knew
About the shit I do
When I look at these pictures of you
Pictures of you, pictures of you
I said, If you only knew
About the shit I do
When I look at all these pictures of you

[Verse 1: Wax]
Girl you got a lot of facebook albums
A favorite, its hard to pick out one
I'd say that mine's Halloween 09
God damn girl why you gotta be so fine?
You dressed up like a kitten and you got me all smitten
My toes start curling and my teeth start gritting
I start unzipping
And into a fantasy world, I slip in
So clearly I can see now
We Fuckin' doggystyle but you're still saying "Meow!"
You tell me pull your hair, I accidentaly pull your weave out
We pickin' up speed now, im about to spit my seed out
Oops, all over your chest
But when I open up my eyes its all over my computer desk
Go to sleep now shame, no sorrow
And I ain't gotta take your ass to breakfast tommorow
Im sayin'

[Hook]
If you only knew
About the shit I do
When I look at these pictures of you
Pictures of you, pictures of you
I said, If you only knew
About the shit I do
When I look at all these pictures of you
Girl

[Verse 2: Wax]
You on instagram now
You have me whilin out
When you took that vacation and took the island rout
Little bikini, ass cheeks sliding out
I had to lock my door like I was hiding out
Grab my dick like im grabbing the mic
And think of all the things I'd imagine you'd like
And what it would be like if I could have you tonight
But without all the awkwardness of actual life
I can see us on a hammock right next to the Atlantic
And this fantasy requires lube, call me a mechanic
Sprinkle salt on my hand, and mix it up with lotion
Cause your pussy did just get, out of the ocean
And im accurate, when im whacking it
Got you blowin' up on my I-Mac and shit
Ey yo, "Intense Imagination" thats the name of my crew
And also how I do when I spank it to you

If you only knew
About the shit I do
When I look at these pictures of you
Pictures of you, pictures of you
I said, If you only knew
About the shit I do
When I look at all these pictures of you

[Outro]
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
Well, Yours are worth a couple hundred million sperm cells
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
Well, Yours are worth a couple hundred million sperm cells
A thousand words..... A couple hundred million sperms
Uh, About to take it away, im passing it to my man jose, OK! Uh
