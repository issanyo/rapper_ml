[Verse 1: Herbal T]
Full throttle
Twin getting busy been spitting since he was a Rugrat with a bottle
I'm like a Ford Model, T cause I'm classic
And I'mma drop funk till I be in a casket
Y'all better stay on that grizzly man
We got lines like the rides at Disney Land
Up in the sky we fly high as a frisbee man
Up with the birds, Wax and Herbal T fuck what ya heard
I be that pinche gringo
Lunes a domingo
Posted on the wall like a pink flamingo
Legendary group like John, Paul, George, and Ringo
The crowd scream my name like Bingo
Wack emcees I'm happy to blatantly
Call you out cause you sound exactly the same to me
You need to focus more on the pens and the pads and ignore all the trends and the fads, putos

[Bridge]
Low budget, low budget
But still you fools you can't touch it
We make beats with a bunch of dumb shit
And then we turn the shit into a club hit
We low budget, low budget
But still you fools you can't touch it
We make beats with a bunch of dumb shit
And then we turn the shit into a club hit

[Verse 2: Wax]
Wanna go against us homie bet the farm
Next day we coming over to collect your barn
And grill up all your chickens and eat some fresh meat
And use your cow's bell to make our next beat, man
We can sample some farts
Turn into a number one jam for the charts
Drop shit old school like hamburger parts
In the game Burger Time like a digital converter I'm
Needed in the '09
If you wanna see clear when it's showtime
So feel free to hate and waste time and debate we don't need your little wack-ass cosign
Y'all soft, we real, so we both like a perfect titty
Y'all shit out of luck, like y'all worked at Circuit City bitches

[Bridge]
Low budget, low budget
But still you fools you can't touch it
We make beats with a bunch of dumb shit
And then we turn the shit into a club hit
We low budget, low budget
But still you fools you can't touch it
We make beats with a bunch of dumb shit
And then we turn the shit into a club hit
