[Verse 1: Wax]
I'm trying to move millions like Regis Philbin
And make Youtube videos with Jesus filmin'
See him in the passenger seat snappin' his neck
Sayin' "since the passion of me, i haven't seen no one this passionate yet"
The industry sees wax as a threat
Cuz they know how dominated by wax can get
Cuz me and herbs got the unlimited train of thought
While a box inside with which they think couldn't contain a grain of salt
My flows all raw, unfiltered like pall mall
Got the internet goin' nuts like pall wall
I seen little kids rappin' on Youtube
Soundin' better than the grown men on the blue tube
Ya'll sweet like butterscotch
So if you go against me id advise not to let your mother watch
Cuz as soon as the battle's done
She'll be in the parking lot screaming
"What son? I never had a son!"
Did i mention she was pretty fat too
Did i mention it's my name on her titty tattoo, wow
You ain't gotta know English when you play it
Cuz its not what I say, its they way that I say it, man
This is my time, spit a witty fly rhyme
It'll shine like the city sky line
I'm signed... to a record label on Pluto
Other artists include: Xenon, Gordon and Ed Menudo
And I ain't tryna stump ya'll now
I'm just so left field that the ump calls foul
It trumps all doubt when my raps begin
And the fucked up thing: I have a twin

I'mma pass this shit to my man Herbal T
