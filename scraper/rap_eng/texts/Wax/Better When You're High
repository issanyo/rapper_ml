[Chorus: Krysta Youngs]
I like you better when you're high
'Cause when you're high you never make me cry
I like you better when you smoke
'Cause when you smoke you laugh at all my jokes
I like you better when you're stoned
'Cause when you're stoned you never bitch and moan
There's just so many reasons why
I like you better when you're high

[Verse 1: Wax]
I'm also glad it's legalized
I got that good shit in my pocket
Woke up, took a trip to the market
Where they jar it and ziploc it
Had to stop at the gas station as I walked along my way
To pick up my chick some chocolate
You know Ferrero Rocher?
No surprise soon as I arrive
She greets me with them pretty eyes and thighs
I said hi, she replies, are you high?
Yes, how'd ya guess? Do I look a mess?
She said, I saw through the peephole
With that pre-roll, chico, she know
My demeanor is calmer
When I smoke as much as I wanna
I ain't never got no worries
I ain't really ever got no drama
I'm a perfect gentleman as I enter into her abode
Ready for whatever unfolds

[Chorus: Krysta Youngs]
I like you better when you're high
'Cause when you're high you never make me cry
I like you better when you smoke
'Cause when you smoke you laugh at all my jokes
I like you better when you're stoned
'Cause when you're stoned you never bitch and moan
There's just so many reasons why
I like you better when you're high

[Verse 2: Wax]
Hanging out at your house
With an ounce in my pouch
Fuck yo couch, fuck yo couch
We be fuckin' on your couch
When you bounce like you bounce
I can see you as my spouse
Girl, you sound like Minnie Mouse
With your little shrilly shouts
I'm in heaven at your casa, king like Mufasa
Before I got to say hasta la vista
We feast on some pasta
Lotsa women that I been with don't approve of my ways
But you different and I think it's amazing

[Bridge: Wax]
You dig me when I fly (fly)
I'll meet you in the sky (meet you in the sky)
We starin' eye to eye  (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no now or never
If I'm ever there with you

[Chorus: Krysta Youngs]
I like you better when you're high
'Cause when you're high you never make me cry
I like you better when you smoke
'Cause when you smoke you laugh at all my jokes
I like you better when you're stoned
'Cause when you're stoned you never bitch and moan
There's just so many reasons why
I like you better when you're high
