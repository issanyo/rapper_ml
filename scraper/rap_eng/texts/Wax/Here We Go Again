[Verse 1: EOM]
Here we go again, here we go again
It's EOM and you know I'm 'bout to blow again
LOA beats got bite like Dobermans
While your beat's lazy playing hooky you sleepin' in
Meditating within, Ho Chi Minh discipline
See me wilin' out with [?] and some hooligans
Then hear my voice laced up on that Pro Tools track
King of the flow so yo I gotta represent that
The flow flow smooth throughout my soul flows
The [?] no doubt that y'all knows
Like Notorious it's unbelievable
So ridiculous that it's inconceivable, word
Tonight we have got the funky soul [?]
James Brown Papa Got a Brand New Bag for that ass
You better wake up like Spike Lee and do the right thing
When I hit you with the jazzamatazz
[?] gifted, unlimited
Rhymes is universal, styles is infinite
No commercials yet, definitive
No rehearsals or has beens but no reversals
See me, Herbal T, Big Wax call it the trinity
You are now witnessing the rawest form of divinity
Prepare for the affinity when you [?] the vicinity, bitch

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again

[Verse 2: Wax]
Here we go again, here we go again
Big Wax blowin' in
You can hear the beer bottles openin'
Toast to the fact I ain't ever gonna [?] again
Here, raise it up, slam it
Goddamn it all I know is win
Seen your girl at the the show front row showin' skin
Left with her under my arm like she deoderant
Throw her in the the cab and hear the cash cab buzzers and lights
That's two times I'm gettin' lucky tonight
I'm in the back seat lovin' my life
Talkin' to the the driver while she under the belt tuggin' the pipe
He said it's a special episode with questions worth double tonight
And then I answered every one of them right
I give you knuckleheads something to bite
'Cause all them little raps that you wrote, ain't none of 'em tight
Only your grandma said they weren't horrible
"Awe, look at his little mix tape; isn't that adorable?"
Awe, while she pinch you on the cheek
Man I'm shittin' on the beat like a pigeon on the street
I'm just shittin', y'all are weak
Different and unique, when you speak
Pass me a pillow and a sheet, I'm gonna get some sleep
Your thing is people snoring
Our thing's crowds roaring when we're touring
You're the human embodiment of boring

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again

[Verse 3: Herbal T]
Here we go again, here we go again
It's Herbal T, I'm bum rushin' the show again
Shave my head put Wax on the marquee
Get the money and run before they ever know it's him
I gotta [?], tryin' to put money off shore like Gilligan
Retire and shine like filament
Everyday hard work, diligent
Still on the microphone every night killin' it
We got LOA on that Wes Montgomery six string
The mix king
Best not [?] me this thing
You bump it on your laptop you're liable to melt your motherboard
I'm tellin' you it is that hot
I got soul like the OJs but get no praise
And small money like insurance copays
I'm gettin' off like snow days
Watch me kill it like a matador in a bull ring gettin' ol√©s
Torro torro, build like a 401K
No need for gun play
When I swashbuckle like Zorro
Chillin' in Japan, sippin' on Sapporo
Yeah, we gettin' loose with it
Pull the liquor out the freezer, make juice with it
It stay cool if you put a little ice with it
[Ayo Herbs, how you get so nice with it?]
It's in the blood

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again
