I remember warm and tender sighs
The night before she said goodbye
The song that we liked playing just for her and I
Now when I hear it I just come apart
It's like a needle in my heart
Each time the music starts

Please DJ don't put that on
We fell in love to that one
Don't play that song on the radio
It's so hard to forget
So here is my request
Don't play that song on the radio

I recall the way she held my arm
As we were dancing in the dawn
The radio on
Swaying to the same old song
It used to sound just like a lullaby
But now it only makes me cry
So don't play that one tonight

Please DJ don't put that on
We fell in love to that one
Don't play that song on the radio
It's so hard to forget
So here is my request
Don't play that song on the radio

On and on and round and round
The record spins
Everytime it's on I keep rememberin'
The things we did together
Now they're gone forever
Round and round it keeps repeating
In my ear
All the words of love that I won't ever hear
I'm walkin' in the rain (remember)
Don't play that song again

Please DJ don't put that on
We fell in love to that one
Don't play that song on the radio
It's so hard to forget
So here is my request
Don't play that song on the radio
