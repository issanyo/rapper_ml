[Hook: Wax]
I've seen many a day with my back against the wall
I've cried many a tear and drank plenty of alcohol
And I'd love to sing for you baby I would sing all night long
But it's gonna take a lot from me to write another love song
I'll never write another love song
You may think that it's wrong
Well, well, well, well
But I'll never write another love song

[Verse 1: Wax]
I had a, couple girls that I loved real dearly
Sincerely, always kept them near me
Together, we seen the future so clearly
Being optimistic and talking about the years we'd
Keep it going, and be together so long
We used to talk about forever, but forever is gone
That's why these days, I assume the worst
I'll never write a love tune or verse
I'm just saying, cause

[Hook: Wax]

[Verse 2: Wax]
I wrote a couple love songs in haste
And now the chords and the melodies have gone to waste
Ask my boy phrase about the one that we co-wrote
Sang it at his wedding three months later the hole broke
Out, and thats what I'm rapping about
So with myself I'm just trying to take the pacifist route
I want inner peace, not pain and hardships
But I'mma maintain regardless
I'm saying cause

[Bridge: Wax]
I ain't dead yet
And I hope I live long
And I'll probably find another
And it'll probably go wrong
But oh well

[Hook: Wax]
I've seen many a day with my back against the wall
I've cried many a tear and drank plenty of alcohol
And I'd love to sing for you baby I would sing all night long
But it's gonna take a lot from me
To sit down with a beat
And go and get all sweet
And write another love song
I'll never write another love song
You may think that it's wrong
Well, well, well, well
But I'll never write another love song
