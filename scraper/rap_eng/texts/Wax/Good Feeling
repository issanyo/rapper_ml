[Chorus: Wax]
I got a good feelin' 'bout today
Like everything is gonna go my way
Ain't got no rhyme or reason
I don't know
I just got a good feelin'

[Verse 1: Wax, Jes Hudak & Camila Recchio]
The birds are singin', yeah they all in good spirits
(Ooh-ooh)
But today it's as if I can understand their lyrics
They be singin' 'bout the sun and how they love it when it shines
(Ooh-ooh)
And the bees be buzzin', havin' nothin' but good times

[Pre-Chorus: Wax, Jes Hudak & Camila Recchio, Wax, Jes Hudak, & Camila Recchio]
And it almost seems like nothing could go wrong
It seems like I am right where I belong
Ooh
So if I seem extra glad it's 'cause of this feeling that I have, yeah

[Chorus: Wax, Wax, Jes Hudak, & Camila Recchio]
I got a good feelin' 'bout today, yodel-ay-hee-hoo
Like everything is gonna go my way
And I hope it do
Ain't got no rhyme or reason
I don't know
I just got a good feelin'

[Verse 2: Wax, Jes Hudak & Camila Recchio]
This feeling that I have I don't know if it's got a purpose
It's hard to put my finger on it like a hot surface
(Ooh-ooh)
I'm a child at the playground standing on top of the slide
About to make my way down and it's gonna be quite a ride
The current's runnin' through me like the engine of a Tesla
I'm higher than the flyer of a single engine Cessna
Feelin' extra extra, you can read about me
When I got this feelin' there's no reason you should doubt me

[Pre-Chorus: Wax, Jes Hudak & Camila Recchio, Wax, Jes Hudak, & Camila Recchio]
And it almost seems like nothing could go wrong (Ayy)
It seems like I am right where I belong
Ooh
So if I seem extra glad it's 'cause of this feeling that I have, yeah

[Chorus: Wax, Wax, Jes Hudak, & Camila Recchio]
I got a good feelin' 'bout today (Ha)
Like everything is gonna go my way
Ain't got no rhyme or reason
I don't know
I just got a good feelin'
I don't know
I just got a good feelin'
