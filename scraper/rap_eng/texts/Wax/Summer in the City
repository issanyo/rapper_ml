Yo, I was driving alone in my car
At like two a.m getting home from the bar
And as usual, there's no spots where I live
So I'm forced to park a couple blocks from the crib
And I'm, walking home like halfway there
A couple cars drive by, ain't no reason to stare
But then the one pulls up, kinda slow like
And their headlights turns in to no light
The passenger seat of the car, someone jumped out from it
And in two seconds flat I had a gun to my stomach
It was clear to see what he wanted
He said give me all your money, if I had some I would've done it
And by this time his boy jumped out of the back
They were both searching me and threatening me and shit like that
The second dude got pissed, pulled my empty wallet on the ground and says ''is this all you got bitch?''
I was scared as fuck, I'm not fronting, cus I know in LA people gets shot for nothing
And these dudes was real young, sixteen maybe
Probably kill me just because this shit seems crazy
And they wanna seem cool to their friends at school
Bragging to other kids how they smoked some fool
But still, I knew the odds were in my favourite
And they wouldn't exhibite that behaviour
So I waited until that they were done, they didn't use the gun
They just punched me in the face and away they runned
They jumped into the car and they skidded off
I felt like I had been shitted on
But atleast I was able to walk away breathing
I went to my house to retire for the evening
The funny thing is on the way there, I saw three different women walking their dogs I swear yo
It just goes to show, anytime, anyone, anywhere you never know
I'm just glad the motherfuckers didn't take my keys
I got home locked the door and drank some Bud Leezy
