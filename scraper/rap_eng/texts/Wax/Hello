[Intro]
Can you give me more beat?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Beware of the crew
The beat fill your body like the heroin do
Rock shows out in Europe and America too
Bout to blow this shit up like the terrorists do
A lot of people talking shit like we an arrogant crew
They preparing to talk, we preparing to do
E cooking up that new like the flavor with the carrots and stew
On and on like Erykah Badu
My name hold weight like a body builder
Rapping for a hobby, it was probably off kilter
Smoke heavy like we just popped off the filter
Marlboro red my horoscope said I killed your
Plans that you had, god damn you mad
My [?] pad got a brand new bag, poppa
My verse is always so proper
Ain't a milkyway world I couldn't stand on top of

[Hook x2]
Hello, hello, hello
Who's that knocking at my front door?
It's good to see ya, it's good to see ya

[Verse 2]
Damn, what do you know, I opened the door
For opportunity, seem happier to see me
It's been a while but you always seem to come around
[?] the good and [?]
Never had a doubt, living everyday with a smile
Reflecting back and we could blaze in the clouds
People gonna waste their moments bored chilling at home
When there's so many things going on around the globe
A whole 'nother life when you're out on the road
Been there before for dope though, not for shows
2014 is all about consistency
We call [?] history cause man I was meant to be
Believe [?] repeats I'm doing this for Bob Marley
And everybody who [?] harming me
As they say "mi casa su casa"
And the world is my playground, hey now

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
