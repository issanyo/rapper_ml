[Verse 1]

Yo, why did everybody clown Rodney King
When he said that why can't we all get along thing
Man it makes perfect sense to me
But history tells us it just wasn't meant to be
And I agree with Jim Morrison
People are strange and some of them are even worse man they evil
And deranged
And they're usually the ones that controls shit
Whether from the podium or from the pulpit
Teaching us not to love, but to be haters
Making war in the name of the creator
Well if god's on both sides
Image if both sides taught that god said love both sides
Yeah, I know it sounds naive
But I'm thankful for every single breath I breathe
And I don't want that taken away, over some petty shit
We all benefit from more love

[Hook]

It's all love
Why can't it be love
When push comes to shove
I just wish that it was all love
It's all love
It's got to be love
When push comes to shove
I just wish that it was all love

[Verse 2]

But we glorify hate as we move toward more
Of a fortified state
Where we send kids off to war to die
Great...ly mislead, our sentences intentionally misread
Technological advances are major
But we can't never get past human nature
Empty rhetoric
Love thy neighbour
Juxtaposed with that tough guy behavior
And as we spread more fear, we see the end of tunnel light up ahead more clear
Yeah, and that's a true threat, cus we ain't invented a weapon we ain't used yet
And on that faithful day that the world ends
I hope I've got a wife, or a girlfriend
Cause the last thing that I wanna do is kiss her
And look her in the eyes
And tell her I'm gonna miss her
Sweet love

[Hook]

It's such a sweet love
Why can't it be love
Yo, when push comes to shove
I just wish that it was all love
It's all love
It's got to be love
When push comes to shove
I just wish that it was all love

[Verse 3]

It makes the world turn
Makes a man want a women
And makes a girl yearn
For a boy
Or a man rather;
And I ain't got breaking news
I ain't Dan Rather
I be a grandfather;
One day if I'm lucky
And I'mma love them like my grandparents loved me
And even tho they're gone
You can see how it's passed down and the love lives on
And that's what I'm tryna focus on more
I guess that's why I wrote this song for
And even though he I can't speak for
I'm guessing that's why E made this beat for
When people do what they love they unknowenly make every task involved become poetry
I'm done with the hate, I just wanna laugh in the sun have fun and create more love

[Hook]

Ye, it's all love
Why can't it be love
Yo, when push comes to shove
I just wish that it was all love
Why can't it be love
It's got to be love
Ye, when push comes to shove
I just wish that it was all love
The world needs more love
Your girl needs more love
Yo, when push comes to shove
I just wish that it was all love
Cus Big Wax got love
And EOM got love
When push comes to shove
I just wish that it was all love
