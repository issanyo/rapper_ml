Baby
I know you've been hurt
This world can be hard on your soul
Heartless and painful I know
But time
Time is on your side
And what seems unbearable now
Will one day seem funny somehow

We are alright
We are alright
We are alright tonight

This world
This world can be so cruel
Making your dreams disappear
Just when you thought you were so near
Oh but this world
This world can be so kind oh yeah
Finding its own wonderous way
Of healing the heartache some way

We are alright
We are alright
We are alright tonight

If you're down on your luck
Just call on me
If you don't know where to turn yeah
Just call on me
And if you're lonely lonely lonely lonely
You know where i'll be
I'll be your shelter your guarantee
