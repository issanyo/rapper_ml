[Hook]

You, never know
How, much I love you
Try, and I try
But I, just can't quit you
You killing me inside
But I, can't live without you
Oh, ohh you, never know

[Verse 1]

Ahh
I've been with you ever since I was a little boy
Searching through cracker jack boxes to find that little toy
You bring me a little joy
But you will destroy me, eventually and feel no empathy
I remember we first met, and about you I wasn't sure
But you had this allure that kept me coming back for more
You warned me upfront you was dangerous
Not to be tapered with the nail that my coffin would be hammered with
But I just figured it would be a short fling
And me and you parting ways, that would be a sure thing
But your cling got so much stronger, it would go much longer than expected, far from in-expensive
I think of all the money that I spent with you
Especially on the days when the rent is due
I'm gonna hit it til' the end of the year, and then I'm through
Aw who am I my pretending, I'mma ride til' the end of you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Check it out yo
It's a one sided relationship, and I'm spitin' from it
It doesn't helped that my mom never liked you one bit
She always warned me that you weren't the right type to run with
The moments of pleasure ain't worth the type of life you come with
In one out the other ear
Another year, another year, you're still fucking here
I love you dear but you fucking my career up
Bam, kick you out, celebrating, lift the beer up
But soon as I'm drinking I'm desperate for your presence
And you're always close by, accessible in seconds
And your essence grips hold of me, then I go and pick you up
You Rick Roll me - I'm never gonna give you up
I need you everyday, so bad I'll steady pay
Any amount required to take my breath away
Sickness and health, only in death do we parted
Loving you, I wish I've never started
Damn

[Hook]

Eyo, I saying man
You got something to ash in?
Oh cool, yea I gotta go outside and smoke a cigarette man
I need to take a fucking break from this song
Fuck this song
And fuck that bitch too...
