[Chorus]
Leaders of the world kill people
They say the smokers of the world are evil
And it seems so bleak and deceitful
That's why I keep it simple with my people
We just gettin'
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high

[Verse 1: Wax]
Tryna get higher than the entourage of Wiz Khalifa
While they hittin' reefer playing FIFA in the penthouse suite at the Burj Khalifa
Higher than the value of the Mona Lisa
Higher than the grand total owed to Visa
So high I question things that I've known since preschool
Like why do breadsticks dipped in marinara sauce go with pizza?
That's like serving me a
Cheese quesadilla with a side of cheese sauce and a tortilla
I ain't saying shit
Who am I debating with?
Excuse me while I take a hit and give my fucking steak a flip
I ain't gon' hurt nobody no time soon
Unless you're offended by my lo-fi croon
So high moving like a frisbee in flight
Music in the air
Loving everywhere
Bitch give me the knife
When I pick up this mic
And get busy you might
Blow your mind like you'd had thought Clayton Bigsby was white

[Chorus]
Leaders of the world kill people
They say the smokers of the world are evil
And it seems so bleak and deceitful
That's why I keep it simple with my people
We just gettin'
We just gettin'
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high

[Verse 2: G. Love]
You know I'm diggin' that beat
I'm down and dirty like a leaf
Decomposing in the dirt so I plant a little seed
Fertiliser, going up, I guess I am
I get Nikes and watch CNN
But now I'm rolling up
Roll the tongue
Smoking microphones, shawty
Shinin' like like Rolling Stone
On a bone from mansions to mobile homes
Just like my music, smokin' that homegrown
I don't care who you is, where you at, who you know
What you think, what you did
I love y'all just the same
And I'mma love you a little more with THC in my brain
It's a euphoric moment
I'm just a stoner
Forgot my lyric
But only for a moment
Now I'm back on track with Wax
And relax, I'm up your brother's stash and never get snatched, jack

[Chorus]
Leaders of the world kill people
They say the smokers of the world are evil
And it seems so bleak and deceitful
That's why I keep it simple with my people
We just gettin'
We just gettin'
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
So high, so high, so high
Gettin' so high
