Leaves are falling green and gold
Changing of the season
Safe and warm against the cold
Within our house new life unfolds

These are the promised days
From cradle to the grave
This is the special time
In which the light will shine

Welcome to the human world
Filled with love and hatred
Some are rich and some are poor
Unto this world our child is born

These are the promised days
From cradle to the grave
This is the special time
In which the light will shine

He's coming
She's coming
Someone to build a new world for us
He's coming
She's coming
To keep the promise in all of us

Heed the warning wind that blows
Ignorance and evil
Rapes the harvest that we sow
Crush the flower where it grows

These are the promised days
From cradle to the grave
This is the special time
In which the light will shine
