[Intro: Audio Snippet]
Now when we understand how this color is produced and how the brightness is just so in-your-face bright, then we can start to apply those design ideas to various technologies. We can use them to make new fabric. New surfaces for plates, for, design a car body paint. All sorts of things that bright color really sells well

[Verse 1: Wax]
Beat savage
I wreak havoc
And decapitate weak rappers
Who speak average on these tracks
I just speed past 'em and keep laughing
And we have to get theatrical each masterpiece
Reaction put greenbacks in my team's satchel
Then we lean back and hit trees naturally

[Verse 2: Herbal T]
We beat chopping
Got heat dropping
Emcees flopping at eavesdropping
We treetop and y'all plea copping
We b-bopping y'all sweep mopping
I'm restocking you're tweet blocking
I'm free rocking y'all need mocking
While me rocking my (?) like free oxygen
Please stop with it

[Chorus: Wax]
We the finest at redefining the beat and rhyme
I see 'em shining blinding the people lining up miles away
We the people that see that we will be keeping regal reason
Weed is legal Evil Knievel on wild display
If all is hopeless and hard to cope with
We oughta focus on the art of dopeness start with the boldest rhyme every day
A spectrum of colors that beckons the brothers
Ain't tryna disrespect no others
We just love all of the shit that we say

[Verse 3: Herbal T]
We them dro copping
Them show-stopping
There's no topping this foe's opposite bro prominent
Flow shaman
It's Obama with no politics
So dominant
Grow ominous
Drone bomb ya with no comment
We no drama, y'all soap operas
With no problem I broke out

[Verse 4: Wax]
I'm old school with this flow fool and my pro tools
I got no rules I just go loose
And make bold moves if I so choose I'll write show tunes
And my whole crew's in the zone too so we won't lose
So just don't snooze
I just roll truth in my own booth
While I (?) no shoes again

[Chorus: Wax]
We the finest at redefining the beat and rhyme
I see 'em shining blinding the people lining up miles away
We the people that see that we will be keeping regal reason
Weed is legal Evil Knievel on wild display
If all is hopeless and hard to cope with
We oughta focus on the art of dopeness and start with the boldest rhyme every day
A spectrum of colors that beckons the brothers
Ain't tryna disrespect no others
We just love all of the shit that we say

50,000 different butterfly species. There are 250,000 different beetle species, let alone bird feather colors and bird species and fish species and all of those need a physics-based understanding. And so my research group needs people, needs students in which, with which to study these amazing things, and so actively, I'd enthusiastically encourage students with an eye in physics, an eye in color, to come and work in this amazing field
