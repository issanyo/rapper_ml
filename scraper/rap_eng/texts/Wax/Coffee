This song is for all the coffee lovers out there
It's called "Coffee"

Coffee
I think about you more than I think about anyone I love
Coffee
I think of you before my eyes even open up
I really really really wanted to write a song about you
But a song isn't even a thing you can listen to
Because you're just brew
There's no consciousness within beverages
I'm an optimist because I wrote this song anyway
Coffee
I think about you more than any ex-girlfriend I've had
Coffee
I think about you more than I think about my mom or dad
I really really really wanted to tell you you're a gem
Instead I discovered how much of a bad person I am
You are not like them
They're my family
You're not even a member of humanity
You're an inanimate object
But still you're a part of me
Because I put you into my body
And without you I'd probably never get out of bed at all
You're all I live for
Coffee
I sip on you alone as the minutes and seconds pass by
Coffee
Sometimes I feel like I'm just drinking you while I'm waiting to die
I really really really wanted to tell you you're the best
Instead I discovered my life is utterly meaningless
Why do I exist
There must be more to this than just this absolutely frickin' delicious hot liquid made of beans
I love coffee
