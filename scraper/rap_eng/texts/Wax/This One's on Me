[Hook]
This one's on me
Don't worry 'bout it
Put down your wallet it's cool
This one's on me
Go have another, I've got it covered
It's the least I can do
This one's on me

[Verse 1]
Meet me at the bar, I'll pay for your cab
Anything you want goes straight to my tab
I'm not stingy with the paper I have
You used to always hook me up when I was doing bad
You deserve a night out man, let's hit the town
And you ain't paying for nothing, not a single round
We gon' stay 'til last call, we gon' shut it down
We gon' put a huge dent in my bank account
We may or may not make it home safe and sound
We might end up in the police car station bound
No matter what we gonna have a fucking ball
No worries, no stress just alcohol
I love you man, I'll holler it out
Our friendship can't be measured in dollar amount
I'm here for you if you got something to talk about
And tonight when we go out...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a check recently, I got substantial dough
And I know you've been going through financial woes
But money is a fleeting thing that was made my us
Love was made by whatever created us
It's not something anyone could ever take from us
The people at the bank, I don't care what they discuss
They say that for retirement, I should save it probably
I'd rather spend the shit now while I'm able bodied
And so for the cash I don't blindly lust
It can't buy me love, it can't buy me trust
But it can buy bottles of rum and such
Life's ridiculous, fuck it let's get drunk as fuck
I love you man, I'll holler it out
Our friendship can't be measured in dollar amount
I'm here for you if you got something to talk about
And tonight when we go out...
