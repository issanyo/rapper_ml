Eighteen
I'd never been far from home
A young lad seekin' destiny
This ship
With a hundred hands or more
To set sail on a stormy sea

I don't know how we can find our way
With only the stars in the sky
To be our guide
I was green inside
When I heard the captain calling

Anchors aweigh now
Anchors aweigh
We're underway now
Anchors aweigh

I've heard tales of boats that ran aground
Ghost ships dead in the sun
And of men bewitched by the siren's song
Those that died were the lucky ones

One wave can knock a man overboard
And in the name of the crown
A man could drown
I was feeling down
When I heard the captain calling

Anchors aweigh now
Anchors aweigh
We're underway now
Anchors aweigh
