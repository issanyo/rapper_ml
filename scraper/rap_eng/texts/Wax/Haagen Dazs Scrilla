Yeah, ain't no stopping Godzilla
Me and EOM we getting Haagen Dazs Scrilla
Getting paid for the cold bars we disperse
Any charges that we incur are reimbursed
I'mma need a receipt for the weed and the Tecates
Money front and center that's the chi of the cheapskates
Not what I need for the glitter and jewels
Its for the pizza delivering fools
Like I told you deliver pizza
Nah Wax did that
So hopefully I can pass some back to ya'll
Thirty percent for the god given job skill
Additional ten if the hot wings are hot still
Yeah, I ain't trippin'
Fuck you and your fat mom if you ain't tippin'
I'm way freaking better than your man at rap
You girls way freaking wetter than a damn wet nap

We're not chilling 'til we getting top billing
Been spitting nicely since Ice T was cop killing
Haagen Dazs Scrilla, turn a penny to a quadrillion
God willing, we're gonna support all our children's children
Intense Imagination in the building filming
Changing history like if the Indians would've just killed them pilgrims
Get your own land, we were unaware you could own land
Man, the ego is inflated by the size of the wallet
Rich people always say, it ain't tricking if you got it
But when it's all gone, they be looking back at it
Like damn, it was tricking when I had it
Drinking is a habit got me thinking I'm an addict
But the drinking and the thinking got me spitting cinematic spectacular rap
You get slapped with a spatula back
Then I go back to cooking my eggs
My homegirl Jen just became an amputee
I feel fortunate, when I look at my legs
I say what's the deal pickle don't be fickle, all's kosher
If ya'll want beef, better get with ya'lls grocer
Cause I ain't got time to argue
Any spare minutes are used to climb up Mount Barstool
So don't god damn bother me
When I ain't working I'm relaxing quite god damn properly
When I finally get a mil' I'mma chill
On my newly bought Amazon riverfront property
Tell my girl I'm gonna hold all my calls
So we can hang together like my scrotum and balls
I don't know what we're gonna do, but I know it involves
A lot of different positions, and piranha fishing expiditions
And a lot of freaking extra distance
Between my eardrums and the cacophony of stress and bitchin'
This rap shit is paying for us
And we be making it rain in the rainforest
