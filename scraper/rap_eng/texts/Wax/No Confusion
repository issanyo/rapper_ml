[Hook: Wax]
If you say what you mean the first time
There wouldn't be no confusion in the first place
If you say what you mean the first time
There wouldn't be no confusion in the first place

[Verse 1: Herbal T]
I'm sick of taking you to places I don't wanna go
I'm sick of you knocking me over like a domino
I'm sick of cleaning up your messes I ain't [?]
Gotta go
It's time for me to say "Geronimo"
Abandon ship
Cause God damn you trip
Your companionshipâ€™s like a camera trick
A damn quick sample for me to step on
Fall to the bottom figured out I should have kept on
Going and never letting you in
This is not a game
But if it was, I'm never letting you win
I recommend you get a new friend
Cause Herbal T's done with that
I happened once never let it again it goes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wax]
Uh
You a stealthy young thing
A sneaky girl you choose your words wisely
Tell me one thing and then come back and surprise me
But I ain't got time for games
I'm trying to find some change
So you're 24/7 arcade is out of my price range
Tell you that I gotta go to the studio and you like
"That's cool, baby do what you do
Go and make your music, I'm so grateful for you
And when you get home, I'm gonna make you some food and shit"
But then I'm in the booth
And I get a text telling me the truth
That you and your damn bitching
Get some ambition
It's a simple message in the chorus
Put your phone down for a second and listen, bitch

[Hook x2]
