I hope she's wearing that blue business suit today
What time is it? Six?
Just in time to hide in these bushes
Stalkin' your mom
Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' stalkin' your mom

Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' your mom. Stalkin' your mom

Haha, I've been stalkin' your mom
For like two years straight
I'm way too shy to ask her out on a date
So I just wait in your neighbors' lawn
With my camera ready and my camouflage on
And I know that I'll get plenty pics
Once she leaves for work at exactly seven twenty-six
I follow her on my bike, but it's hopeless
Cause I'll never keep up with her Ford Focus
So I kidnapped her golder retriever
Wanted to return it just to please her
But forgot to feed her
Taking care of a dog is hard
Gave it to her dead, said it got hit by a car
Stalkin' your mom
Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' stalkin' your mom

Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' your mom. Stalkin' your mom
Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' your mom
Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom

Yo, I dressed up as a pizza delivery guy
Show up at the door and give her a pie
She says:
(I didn't order nuttin' you geek.)
(You've been giving me free pizza like once a week.)
Oops, so I disguise my voice with a device
So she don't know what my voice sounds like
So when I call like a telemarketer just to talk to her
She don't think the pizza guy is stalkin' her
Sometimes I stay in my bathroom for days
Just looking at the scrapbooks I made
My life-size doll is almost there
I just need a couple more strands of hair
Stalkin' your mom
Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' your mom
Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' your mom. Stalkin' your mom
Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' stalkin' your mom
Stalkin' your mom
Stalk stalk stalkin' stalkin' your mom

(Hey, what's this right here?)
