[Verse 1]
I'd really like, to take you on a picnic
When all the leaves begin to fall
I pour you a glass of wine; you'd sip it
And I tell you life is not so bad at all

[Verse 2]
I'd really like to take you to the beach
Some exotic port of call
I'd hold you close, within my reach
And I'd tell you that life is not so bad at all

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Girl when can I see ya?
So you can be my stress reliever, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
It dont matter where I take you
And gotta go, nowhere at all
Cause girl just being around you,(Make me feel like this)
That life is not so bad at all
