Wax: Verse 1
Yo, for a long time I ain't have no money at all
But I just got a record deal bitch let's ball
Imma call all of my old peers
And we gon do it like we did it in the old years
We gon sip cold beers chill in the limousine son
I'm sick of being old imma stick to being young
Imma throw away the nicotine gum, get my cancer on
If you said "yes he gives a fuck" you answered wrong
Me and my boys hangin out curbside
We amped up man we ready to go for a ride
The chauffeur arrives, we put the keg in very quick
This is bout to be some legendary shit man
We start to roll around, all over town
Stereo is pounding my own sound man it's join down
We celebrating the american dream
And every time we roll the window down this is what we screamin

(Chorus)
Hey
Do you wanna ride
We can fit fifteen plus in the limousine bus outside
And we bout to get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, again and again, oooohhhh

Wax: Verse 2
We bar hoppin
And we ain't looking for a deal we ain't car shoppin
Our options are plentiful, having all this money is incredible
I will spend it all tonight I don't give a fuck
We at our fifth location
Sounds like we listening to a disco station
It's a karaoke bar full of soccer moms
Lady on stage whylin out singin chaka khan
I'm on the dance floor sippin on a beer
The cougar next to me starts to whisper in my ear
God damn she's about to hit menopause
But she got a fat ass and a thong like dental floss
I told her bout the limo I had
And that I want her to get into it bad
She said I got a bunch of friends I said cool you should bring em along
And now they all rollin with us and they singin this song
They like

(Chorus)
Hey
Do you wanna ride
We can fit fifteen plus in the limousine bus outside
And we bout to get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, again and again, oooohhhh

Wax: Verse 3
We gotta make a quick stop at the liquor store keg spot
Cuz we tapped out like a figure four leg lock
Me and herbs whylin outside of the mini mall
Pantera air drums actin like we vinnie paul
When we rock out we don't never settle
For anything less than heavy metal level
Put the pedal to the floor bus driver, Vamonos
We got more budweiser we common folks, imma toast
To the future to the past to all of the stupid ass
People who said I couldn't  do it lift your glass
Herbal T salud dude
And one more toast for the dude who invented Youtube
We cruise through town steadily ragin
Cuz this ain't just any occasion
And every time we stop new people get on the bus
And they all sing along with us, they out the window
Screamin

(Chorus)
Hey
Do you wanna ride
We can fit fifteen plus in the limousine bus outside
And we bout to get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, again and again, oooohhhh
Hey
Do you wanna ride
We can fit fifteen plus in the limousine bus outside
And we bout to get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, get it in, get it in
Get it in, get it in, again and again, oooohhhh
