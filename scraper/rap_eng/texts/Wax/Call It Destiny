Meet me where you heart and the highway runs tonight, tonight
Jump into these wheels of fire and together we'll ride, we'll ride

Somewhere where we've never been
Somewhere where a chance is taken on a dream
Somewhere where we can begin
To let some passion out and some freedom in

Well, somewhere in this mixed up and crazy world there's a place, there's a place
Where people like us can be free to make our own mistakes, get a break

Come on there's no reason to wait
To realize the brave new world we can create
Now before it gets too late
Spin the wheel, shake the hand of fate

Call it destiny
Every step you take leads you where you should be
Call it destiny
'Cause you can't escape what was meant to be
Call it destiny

Aw, come on make a stand take my hand and don't ever let go, no no
It's written in the stars in the cars on the radio, let's go

Somewhere where we've never been
Somewhere where a chance is taken on a dream
Somewhere where we can begin
To let some passion out and some freedom in

Call it destiny
Every step you take leads you where you should be
Call it destiny
'Cause you can't escape what was meant to be

Call it destiny
Every step you take leads you where you should be
Call it destiny
'Cause you can't escape what was meant to be

Meet me where you heart and the highway runs tonight
Oh, sweet freedom
Jump into these wheels of fire and together we'll ride
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Meet me where you heart and the highway runs tonight
Oh, sweet freedom
Jump into these wheels of fire and together we'll ride
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Meet me where you heart and the highway runs tonight
Jump into these wheels of fire and together we'll ride
Meet me where you heart and the highway runs tonight
Jump into these wheels of fire and together we'll ride
