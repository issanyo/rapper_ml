Golden sands sunny days
A beautiful girl in emerald waves
Out of my depth
Over my head
I found heaven in her bed

A mystery
Revealed to me
Higher than I'd ever been
Out of this world
I was hurled
Faster and faster
And now I'm falling

Floating in a silken stream
Drifting through a velvet dream
Out of sync
Out of time
Out of body
Out of mind

We shared a slice
Of paradise
How could I ever look back
Into her web
I was led
Over and over
And I'm still falling

Down below the surface
Where the heart and soul of me
Dissolves into the whirlpool
Of emotion running free
All of my resistance
Disappears without a trace
I'm open to suggestion
I am flying I am flying
High above the mountains
And high above the clouds
Soaring with a passion
That inside is bursting out
And i can almost see forever
Shining like the sparkle in her eyes

A mystery
Revealed to me
Higher than I'd ever been
Out of this world
I was hurled
Faster and faster
And now I'm falling

Golden sands sunny days
A beautiful girl in emerald waves
Out of my depth
Over my head
I found heaven in her bed
Heaven in her bed
