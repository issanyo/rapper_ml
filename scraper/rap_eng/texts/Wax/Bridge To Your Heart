You-hoo-hoo you've been gone for so long

Look at what you're doing
And I-hi-hi yes I know that I was wrong

See what I was losing

Little run-around

Little lost and found

Don't make me crazy
Just bring your body back home
Right here where you belong

Whoa
Building a bridge to your heart
Whoa
Let's make a new start
Build a bridge to your heart

I don't know what the future's gonna be
Good or bad
Time won't be your saviour
And I can't give you no written guarantee
I won't make you sad
But I'll be on my best behaviour

Look what you're doing when you put me down
When you put me down

Made me the clown

Just how much lovin's in me

Building a bridge to your heart
Whoa
Let's make a new start
Build a bridge to your heart

Listen, I'll take you any way I can tonight
Come back and satisfy my appetite
You gotta know you mean that much to me
To get you back you know I'll do anything

Just bring your body back home
Right here now baby where you belong
