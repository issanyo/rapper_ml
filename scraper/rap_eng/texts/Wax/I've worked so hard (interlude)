We celebrate by not remembering a thing
It doesn't make sense what were we celebrating

I've worked so hard
I've worked so hard

Whether win or lose we always do the same thing
Many I love you's with all my crew I'm thanking

We've worked so hard
We've worked so hard

Most humans have studied a little history
That's why we celebrate the losses and the victories
Cause either way it's hard work just to fight the war
And oftentimes it means another fight's in store
Wake up tomorrow, hopefully I do
Just in case toast to me and toast to you
