[Verse 1: Wax]
Rollin' stone I been one all my life
Rhymin' on a quest like Tip and Phife
Somethin' makes me think that I should stay
Well that's when I be on my merry way (yeah yeah yeah)
Can't settle down, can't settle down
Gotta get into the whip and push the pedal down
I can't sit around, I can't sit around
I gotta see a different city, see a different town

[Pre-Chorus: Herbal T]
Never gotta worry when I ride
Never in a hurry just vibe
Window down, radio turned up high
Everybody hear me outside when my ride go by

[Chorus]
I'm gonna ride under open skies
'Til the day I die I'm go'n ride ride ride
Floatin' like a seagull
All I got is freedom on my mind

[Verse 2: Wax]
People always postin' where they at
On social media and this and that
Me, I'm cruisin' through New Mexico
And I just threw my phone out the window (well well well)
Can't tell me that I gotta be a work now
Can't tell me that my radio's too loud
Can't tell me that I ever gotta turn down
I get to heaven, I'm gonna swerve through the clouds

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge: Wax]
You can't tie me down, I'm a rider for life
Watch me breeze past
I like to live fast, hit the gas
Whiplash

[Chorus]

[Outro: Herbal T]
Just ride with us
Just ride with us
Now fly with us
Come on, fly with us
Yeah ride with us
Get high with us
Now fly with us
Do or die
Die, ride, let's ride
