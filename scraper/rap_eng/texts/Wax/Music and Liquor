[Intro]
Yeah, owwww oooooo oooooo
Eom man I like to drink a lot
A lotta people like to party and shit
But lately its just been getting ridiculous

[Verse 1]
I spent all my money on women and wine
And didn't, give enough time to the rhythm and rhyme
I stay focused on the nickel and dime
I should be, Benjamin thinking
But when I get them I be spending them drinkin'
And then I wake up, feelin' nervous and lifeless
A thin line between worthless and priceless
When my life gets confusing ahead of me
I don't ever solve problems I just start boozin' heavily
In san diego I got off work everyday around four
And every single day the roadworker next door
Comes home with an eighteen pack
Of miller high life
I said, my life is heading down a path thats way too sim-
Ilar, I'd prefer not to end up like him
And I'd look up and I'd cringe
But everytime I try to change I say fuck it and binge
Thats my life

[Hook]
I've been with you so long
And my love for you so strong
But sometimes it feels so cold
And baby it gets so old
Wondering why, I stumble and cry
Yeah, my life's occupied by music and liquor

[Verse 2]
I can't stop drinking, I can't stop smoking, I can't stop writing
I should be the can't stop spokesman
Addictive personality, ironically
I write my realest shit when I escape from reality
I drink to forget, then I write to remember
Its been like that since my high school tenure
I can't imagine if I never had this rappin' hobby
I'd rarely be happy probably
But I knew a lotta people when I lived back in Maryland
That had it way worse gettin' addicted to heroin
So I shouldn't be too pissed
I'm just gettin sick of writtin drunken self help to-do lists
That remain unchecked, cause I never follow through
And when you move old habits follow you
And I can't quite shake this ape from off my back
It seems its safe strapped up tight
Eh y'all thats my life

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I guess I'm trying to escape from the fear and the sadness
Its madness, turn beer into gladness
Its sorta like a miracle of Christ
Good timing I could use some spirtual advice
Man, I used to hate the taste of beer as a kid
And they say times change and its clear that they did
Cause now it seems every night I'm intox-
Icated by myself in a little ass box

[Hook]
