[Chorus]
Girl, you're the high tide in the night time, you're dangerous
But to take a risk with you, girl, that's all I want
Girl, you're the high tide in the night time, you're dangerous
But to take a risk with you, girl, that's all I want
That's all I want

[Verse]
And girl, you is my poison
You're a drug, I wanna do ya
It's something you do to me
Yeah, it's something that you do to me
Klonopin for breakfast
'Cause, girl, you got me stressin'
Never know what your mood gon' be
Never know what your next move gon' be

[Chorus]
Girl, you're the high tide in the night time, you're dangerous
But to take a risk with you, girl, that's all I want
You're the high tide in the night time, you're dangerous
But to take a risk with you, girl, that's all I want
'Cause you're the high tide in the night time, you're dangerous
But to take a risk with you, girl, that's all I want

[Outro]
That's all I want
High tide
That's all I want
Dangerous
That's all I want
Dangerous
You're all I want
All I want
You're all I want
