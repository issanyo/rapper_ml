Attention,j’essaye de mettre les paroles en français avec la meilleure traduction possible

[Couplet 1]
This is something that you can't anticipate
Let it sit up on the stove let it resonate
Court side pool side in the cloriene
Fuck a cigarette man i need more weed
Drinkin , sake bombs got Versace on....
Sex in the morning where do you belong ?
Put my shoes on in the morning like I'm mr Rogers
Watching scarface, eatin Kenny Rogers

[Pré-Refrain]
I been spending money all week
I been smokin all that weed
I been sippin on that lean
You can put the cash on me
Put the cash on me
Never got the gas on e
You can put the cash on me
Got dammit I said it if you want me

[Refrain]
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight, are we fuckin tonight

[Pont]
Touchin your body girl if you want me just say it
Up on your body girl if you want I can play it
And if you want lovin lets smoke this weed n get faded
I jump in your body and now your callin me baby

[Couplet 2]
Ride it like a nascar
Now you wanna fuck to a fast song
Now you want the kisses and the hugs
But I ain't got time for the love
It's time for some lights camera action
I'm lookin for a one night attraction
Take ya time just show me the direction
I'm lookin for some good satisfaction
It's time for some lights camera action
I'm lookin for a one night attraction
Take ya time just show me the direction
I'm lookin for some good satisfaction

[Refrain]
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight, are we fuckin tonight

[Pont]
Touchin your body girl if you want me just say it
Up on your body girl if you want I can play it
And if you want lovin lets smoke this weed n get faded
I jump in your body and now your callin me baby

[Refrain]
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight
Are we fuckin tonight, are we fuckin tonight
