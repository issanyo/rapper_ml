[Verse 1: August Alsina]
Word got around that a nigga got shot
Heard a nigga drew down and he bucked so his ass got popped
We was on my block tryna move these rocks
Tryna stack this cash on the low, gotta duck these cops
We was right off 3rd and Pollock, chilling in the back of the track
Niggas got packs, tryna get them racks
X5, I was riding in the back
With the Brother's Fried Chicken and the gat in my lap
17 had no dreams
Drinking 4 LOKO, Sprite and codeine
First class I was on lean
Said fuck high-school so I left Reed

[Pre-Chorus: August Alsina]
No one told me life would be this way
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same

[Chorus: August Alsina]
People dying every day
That ain't nothing new when you from downtown, downtown
Out here trying to make a way
I won't let these niggas take me downtown, down
(So I ride) Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
(So I ride) Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Phone just ring, heard a nigga got got
He was over in the east, last thing that he heard six shots
He ain't get no love from the cops, nobody got caught
Real talk when I heard who it was, my heart damn near stopped
Somebody done killed my brother now I gotta get back
Letting off cause a nigga gotta feel that
Sitting shotgun with the shot gun
When you hear the shots come, nigga don't run
Already bad, it can only get worse
Hand full of steel cause the shit still hurts
Cut so deep when they put him in the hearse
Never saw 25, had to put 'em in the dirt

[Bridge: August Alsina]
No one told me life would be this way
I swear nobody told me
Guess this is the game we chose to play
Crazy how it's always been the same

[Chorus: August Alsina]
People dying every day
That ain't nothing new when you from downtown, downtown
Out here trying to make a way
I won't let these niggas take me downtown, down
(So I ride) Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
(So I ride) Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Once upon a time downtown in the 9
Where they don't mind dying
Sworn to a life of crime, was a young'n only stood 5'5
Big money on his mind
Clothes ain't wrinkled while his hands on his iron
Shot six times right in front of my mom
Had a .32, man I'm lucky to survive
On that Pac "Juice", real niggas don't die
Bitch, I'm from A-Town, slang crack on the same sac
Blood stains there from a homie with his head cracked
Bome Gs like A-Wax
They been doing this shit way back since A-Track
And we yell "Rida Gang Act"
You can get fame there from the way you go and bang that
Truth from the head watch how you aim that
Price on your head and we gonna take that
It's about to go down
You ain't about this then you better go now
Sun going down, keep the 'dow down
Everybody lay down, ski mask down
All you gonna see is my eyes and my frown
Last thing you hear is my gun going pow
It happens every day round my way
This ain't nothing new you grew up downtown, huh!

[Chorus: August Alsina]
People dying every day
That ain't nothing new when you from downtown, downtown
Out here trying to make a way
I won't let these niggas take me downtown, down
(So I ride) Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
(So I ride) Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
Riding on these niggas, I be riding, I be riding on 'em
