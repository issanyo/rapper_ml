[Intro: Kidd Kidd]
Kidd Kidd, nigga
Uh, Kidd

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
Pop a nigga like corn, crunch and munch style
When I go to score, I call that shit a touchdown
Money counter's going brrt
My diamonds shining, going burr
Get the fuck up out my lane, bitch burr
Smoking and drinking, I swear everything's a blur
You be kickin' it, I kick a bitch out to the curb
Don't spill no drink on this chinchilla fur
I had to wait my turn, now watch a nigga turn up
When you get this money all these bitches turn up
But you live and you learn, play with fire, you get burned
Fire this beat burns, put this bitch in an urn
Why you act so concerned?
Only God can judge me, court adjourned bitch

[Chorus: Kidd Kidd]
I be buckin' at the second line
They told me turn up and I broke the knob
Man, I swear that check came right on time
I was fallin' off, that check came right on time
Right on time, that check came right on time
I was fallin' off, that check came right on time
Right on time, that check came right on time
That check came right on time, that check came right on time

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I used to be fucked up, but now a nigga ballin'
Screamin' free C-Murder out that Lambo in New Orleans
I got fifty cash on me, and I got thirty in this forty
They say the young nigga retarded, his diamonds look like water
Yeah, crystal clear, I tell a bitch to disappear
Presidential Rollie, sixty racks for this one here
I only smoke strong and medicine only when I sip
I keep a big smoke sack and an extra clip
I run my city, and you don't even run your bitches
That shit is sad, but that ain't even none of my business
I'm just gon' sip this drink, keep rollin' up the stank
Every time you see me it look like I just left the bank, it's Dolph

[Chorus: Kidd Kidd]
I be buckin' at the second line
They told me turn up and I broke the knob
Man, I swear that check came right on time
I was fallin' off, that check came right on time
Right on time, that check came right on time
Right on time, that check came right on time
I was fallin' off, that check came right on time
Right on time, that check came right on time

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
This big ass dollar sign around my neck a whole ticket
I've been rocking diamonds way before I met 50
I been pullin' up at the club, they like girl who is he?
I just might not walk in that bitch if you jump in here with me
I hope you know you finished if you saw some trouble
I got some shooters 'bout that dumb shit, call theyself the muscle
Trap house boomin', put that on my blood brothers
Layin' coats down, walking over blood puddles
I read all your comments on the social media
Just know I ain't being social when I meet you
Niggas get all in their feelings, then they wanna meet you
You ain't a real nigga, don't approach me for a feature

[Chorus: Kidd Kidd]
I be buckin' at the second line
They told me turn up and I broke the knob
Man, I swear that check came right on time
I was fallin' off, that check came right on time
Right on time, that check came right on time
I was fallin' off, that check came right on time
Right on time, that check came right on time
That check came right on time, that check came right on time
