[Intro]
Hashtag loyalty has no price nigga
Fuck the fame
All or nothin' nigga
The squares out the circle

[Hook]
I can see that you a pussy nigga
I see it in your eyes
You fell in love with a pussy nigga and now she mine
You said you never was a pussy nigga?
Stop lyin'
You better watch out for these pussy nigga
They in disguise

[Verse 1]
Doot-doot-doot, my choppa got a stutter problem
Light a nigga on Harlem Nights boxin'
When they can't talk to you they talk about you
Got my hands dirty from milkin' so many cowards
You better watch who you talkin' to
Last nigga got the coffin, ain't caught the flu
Seen me with the same team, ain't nobody knew
We get a lot of shit but ain't nobody knew
If you a snitch it don't apply to you
Big Mac out the window, McDonalds drive thru
Potato on the barrel, here's some fries too
For some extra cents you could get it super sized too
Play no games with these niggas cause they fake and they phony
Everybody claim they beefin' but it's bunch of baloney
I don't need nobody with me, do my dirty on my lonely
I ain't runnin' to no car nigga, I got it on me

[Interlude]
You already fuckin' know tity fuckin' baby. I'm zone rider baby, all that talkin' bout you beefin' nigga, you ain't beefin' nigga. Stop all that fucking shit man, you fit the shoe nigga wear it. You fit this motherfuckin' shoe? Nigga wear that bitch nigga. These niggas be everywhere man. Talkin' about a nigga fuckin' everywhere, nigga everywhere. Nigga you ain't there. Fuck you already know where we at

[Hook]
I can see that you a pussy nigga
I see it in your eyes
You fell in love with a pussy nigga and now she mine
You said you never was a pussy nigga?
Stop lyin'
You better watch out for these pussy nigga
They in disguise

[Verse 2]
It ain't time to play, you got that iron in your face
I try to tell you keep it real, you still lie in my face
Both my partner know where your baby momma stay
If you ain't home then that ho gon' have to die in your place
Niggas wanted beef and went and got a steak
Then they went to sleep, then he got away
Word on the street, whatever we say
If you keep this shit discreet, we could get away
Cause nigga's lips stay open like pussy hoes
Softer than cookie dough
Gangsta I don't know what you read about
Hustler pump drugs out my momma house
Bitch you better not air it out
I'm 'bout to call Mario out
Give you somethin' to talk about
Tell that pussy ass nigga what I'm all about

[Interlude 2]

Come see me nigga. 2014, it's our year, we been had this shit, Kidd Kidd. You know we got the fuckin' Unit, Rider Man here nigga, on some boss shit

[Hook]
I can see that you a pussy nigga

You fell in love with a pussy nigga and now she mine
You said you never was a pussy nigga?
Stop lyin'
You better watch out for these pussy nigga
They in disguise
