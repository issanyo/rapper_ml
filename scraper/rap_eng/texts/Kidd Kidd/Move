[Hook: 50 Cent]

Nigga, when I say move you better get out my way
'For you have me in my hoopty, loading my K
Nigga move when the chopper spray
Cause these shells will hit you from a block away
Nigga, when I say move you better get out my way
Finna have me in my hoopty, low my cane
Nigga move when the chopper spray
Cause these shells will hit you from a block away
Nigga when I say move

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Empires, cash cows revenues
Bugatti, one stripe like Pepe Le Pew
I go to church and I kneel on the pew
And ask God for forgiveness when the mobs come through
I hit the club and throw my set up, In Hermes
From my toes to my neck up Hoes wanna check us
10 bottles and VIP, 10 models and it's all on me, yeah
We move like hyenas on death fetus
You get victimized tryina throw the dick, be
Switch to foreign cars, jumped in the hoopty
Cause last week niggas tried to shoot me

[Hook]
Nigga, when I say move you better get out my way
'For you have me in my hoopty, loading my K

Cause these shells will hit you from a block away
Nigga, when I say move you better get out my way
Finna have me in my hoopty, low my cane
Nigga move when the chopper spray
Cause these shells will hit you from a block away
Nigga when I say move

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
You know I'm hood so I stay with the retched
Got an itchy trigger finger, don't make me scratch it
Yeah, I run the game, watch them niggas go and blast it
Be a home runner, a duck like Daffy
No lights, no cameras, all action
No bags, no luggage, but we packing
Your life, your air, gonna grasp it
Too late, tore your face, goes casket
Notice, get it tested, drum under the cake like a picnic basket
Turn wives to widows, sons to bastards, we call that ' magic

[Hook]
Nigga, when I say move you better get out my way
Finna have me in my hoopty, low my cane
Nigga move when the chopper spray
Cause these shells will hit you from a block away
Nigga, when I say move you better get out my way
Finna have me in my hoopty, low my cane
Nigga move when the chopper spray
Cause these shells will hit you from a block away
Nigga when I say move

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
Never under pressure, in a turmoil
Rushing mob, extort heads, pressing for they oil
I spray rockets out my space craft
They hit you blindside, homie holding this
The lil' homie shooting over eye patch
The mind, 45s leave a nigga dead
See, it's a cold world we're living in
Stomping on my life like they Timberlands
Four door, 650 pipe in the sentiment with my woman friend
The stash pop out, the strap clip extend
30 shots out the handgun, close on a point blank so a nigga can't run

[Hook]
Nigga, when I say move you better get out my way
Finna have me in my hoopty, low my cane
Nigga move when the chopper spray
Cause these shells will hit you from a block away
Nigga, when I say move you better get out my way
Finna have me in my hoopty, low my cane
Nigga move when the chopper spray
Cause these shells will hit you from a block away
Nigga when I say move
