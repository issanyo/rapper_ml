Take a break for a while
Take a rest, do your very best

Take five, honey
Five, honey

Search in your bag
Light up a fag
Think it's a drag, but you're so glad
To be alive, honey
Alive, honey

Say, when this is all over
You'll be in clover
We'll go out and spend
All a your (blue money)
Blue money (blue money)

Do-do-you-do, n'-do-do-you-do

Well the cameraman smiles
Take a break for a while
Do your best, your very best
Take five, honey

Well, you search in your bag
Light up a fag
Think it's a drag, but you're so glad
To be alive, honey
Alive, honey

All a your (blue money)
