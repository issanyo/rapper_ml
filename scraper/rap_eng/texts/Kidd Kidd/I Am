[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
American Trapstar, N.O. land law
But I won't be reppin' out there in my repertoire
Do it for the 9 who thought that we could get this far
And I could give a fuck, shit a heck who you are
But I am...
The new Soulja Slim, the new Pac, the new Biggie
The new 50, I got more shooters with me
The old Hov, Illmatic Nas, Life Is Good Nas
DMX when that was hot, Badboy I'll never stop
C-Murda in that cell block, Mac when he was shellshock
Nigga I am the All On U BG, Weezy Wee
Sqad Up, Dedication, Carter 1, 2, and 3
I'm Juvenile and Solja Rags 400 Degreez
Mr.Cool when he was Big Boy, the whole New Orleans
I'm Big Pun, I'm Big L, I'm that mama said Knock You Out LL
I'm Boosie writin' raps from a jail cell
I'm T.I., but I ain't got all these guns for sale
I'm Yo Gotti with that coke on the scale
I'm Young Jeezy and Gucci Mane in the same cell
I am... The Soul Tape Fab, Kanye when he mad
Styles P and Jadakiss in the Lab
I am the Geto Boys, NWA I don't give a fuck
I am the whole G-Unit with Game and Buck
The Paid In Full Rakim, Big Daddy Cane
Straight from the streets like Meek Mill with the braids
I am the truth and the reason I'm Beanie Sigel
I'm Kidd Kidd not the kid up in the [?]
