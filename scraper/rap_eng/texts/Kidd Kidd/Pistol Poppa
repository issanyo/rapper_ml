[Hook]
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
I hop up, I don't drive by
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
Hollow-tips, extended clips, and .45s
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
Niggas mad at me, I think I know why
'Cause nigga, I'm a pistol popper
Better run from me, before I take your life

[Verse 1]
First things first
Nigga, you can get clapped quick
I'll make a nigga disappear like magic
Abracadabra, I ain't talkin' about hat tricks
Bullets hit his ass, make his ass do a backflip
Niggas act funny since I got on my rap shit
They rather see me stuck in the hood on some trap shit
I shoot it out, broad day, like in traffic
I come from the Shadow family, nigga we savage
In the hood I come from
There's dirty Glocks on my block
And we run when the ones come
'Cause nigga we ain't trying to get caught (Get caught)
He caught me slipping on a Tuesday night
But he was just woofing, he didn't want no fight
Then I caught his bum ass, trying to sell him a bike
Bullets, flyers, tires, screeching, turn at the light (The light)

[Hook]
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
I hop up, I don't drive by
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
Hollow-tips, extended clips, and .45s
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
Niggas mad at me, I think I know why (Woo)
'Cause nigga, I'm a pistol popper (Kidd kidd)
Better run from me, before I take your life

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
Back on that bullshit, that man got a full clip
Bullets burn through him, niggas hot as the pool pit
Hit you in your back, and watch you do a full flip
Ain't nobody gon' say nothing, that's hood shit
Vest on, teflon, nigga I'm clunkin'
Decrept on, left gone, brains on your cockpit
You could tell I walk this and not just talk it
Nigga, big ass talk just like the type of target
[?] the hood that I come from
The good die young, and live they life out on the run
The Lord's always certain 'cause they know I got my gun
I'd rather get caught with it than caught without one
'Cause when I got that top down, I'm letting that AK thump
Yeah, that's how I'm on and on it
Knock him, top down, quick to put a hole in one
Like I'm golfing, golfing

[Hook}
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
I hop up, I don't drive by
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
Hollow-tips, extended clips, and .45s
Nigga, I'm a pistol popper
Niggas mad at me, I think I know why
'Cause nigga, I'm a pistol popper
Better run from me, before I take your life
