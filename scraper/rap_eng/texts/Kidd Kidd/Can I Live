[Verse:]
Ah
Live from these streets
I ran to you the kidd there's nothing realer
Keep them squares out your circle
While I’m watchin every nigga watching me closely
I don’t sleep
Ghosts haunt me
My gun taught me
The streets taught me
Keep it all on me
OG, the Army
I’m great like Tony scar you face like Tony
I’m on another level, I come from the ghetto
Black kettle, spit fire like a devil
Hidin’ from Mr. Jekyll
Can’t block out the stir of echoes
Put more weed in my cigarillo
I’m on that purple light Donatello
You make me think back
Like I used to run a track
I probably would have won the medal
Flowers on your grave look like a beautiful medal
Let my gun wait like she’s trying to tell you hello
Right at the light I came like cousin Harrow
You don’t like what you’re seeing
You can change the chapter
Will I change
Hell no
That would be the day the hell froze
I come from the bando
Everything’s scandal
Life is full of choices that you make
And you can’t handle the tickle me like elmo
I’m picking up more ammo
Dressed all in camel
I know these haters are mad though
The flow is sick
I got a bad chord
Good luck for these bad hoes
Stay in your place like
I’m throwin’ elbows
Like let me in this bitch
My wrist is lying up
Lime how you flip the switch
Around the gang, bitch I never switch
He used to whip me with a switch
My paw left me with a quarter of brick
The rest of you are all treating me like shit
You won’t get a whip from me
I am the shit
I swear I’ve been everything but rich
Can I live [x3]
