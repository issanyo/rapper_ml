[Intro]
Uh, Ridagang
You know what it is, when it is what it is
SALINI MUSIC!

[Verse 1: Precious Paris]
Why lie to a philosophical goddess, you sound retarded
Paris the wound is where you niggas started, damn
What ever happened to women and man
The only time i lie is when i’m on the stand
Handle my own beef, niggas know me
Approach me, like why you do that to the homie
Simple, devotion mixed with emotion
Will have that lying ass smoking in slow motion
Move sideways, go dutch
Swoll tits, Swoll ass, Swoll clutch
Everywhere my team at they know us
They go nuts, no opinion, all facts yup yup
So next time you think about fronting
Please be sure to know one thing
I’m a star goodwill hunting
And teach your little no-frills ass a little something

[Hook: ToasT]
Why Lie
If it ain’t in you when it’s time to ride
Cause it ain’t easy on the other side
Everybody wanna live it up
When it’s go time, hesitate to grip it
(2X)


[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
It’s all real you could see it in my eyes
Word to Chucky got bodies on my nine
No coincidence i got hit 6 times
They wanna make my mama cry
Thank god I’m still alive, homicide on my mind
Deep down you gotta drive past the line, fuck em
We gon hide out and ride on 'em
Then we gon' hop out and pop on 'em
Neighborhood watch tried to call the cops on 'em
Mask on chopper cutting like Michael Myers on 'em
When i say i got that grip, it ain’t pliers on 'em
I can’t get caught too many pries on me
So all you hear is SKIRT, tires screeching
Middle fingers to polices
Cause if we beefing then we creeping got a gun you better keep it like a secret
On your waist and where you sleeping, Kidd Kidd nigga


[Hook]


[Verse 3: ToasT]
We reject your deposit here
Ya niggas not in tune ya dance everywhere
Deal with loyalty like its gear
Wonder the equation when you have to match it up with fear
Easy it is to befriend all
When you controlling the guap and its nothing to ball
What about the SOS call?
Heavy breathing knowing another man might have to fall
Stand up or back down for this round
We ain’t talking patron, nigga it’s going down
Mental struggle begins
Is it in you to commit to sins, fuck around start your end?
I ain’t with the funny shit up under me
Ego got a stroke, got a lady in the passenger seat
1889 til the death of me, starting 5 can call
Guarantee that we squad up

[Hook]
