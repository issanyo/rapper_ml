( Curt Digg ) Verse

I'm on that real nigga shit
Cop the work and pack it up and movem out quick
I flip an ounce into a brick
Said you niggas ain't no hustlas u ain't flip an ounce of shit
Hate da game we gettin rich
Said we started from the bottom now we poppin off the criss
Got the ice all on my wrist
Black he showed me how to whip it and been gettin it ever since
Wit ya girl all on my dick
Had her fuck me over dinner call it money well spent
Pussy niggas talkin shit
Till that choppa come an hit ya

Fuck niggas online talkin bout what they gone do to me
Run up catch a hollow
Bitch this beef shit nuttin new to me

Hoeass niggas thats what you to me
Some muthafuckin actors you should tryout for a movie scene
Nigga imma G
Muthafuck yo features
You fuckin wit a general the sergeant and the teacher
Have you niggas bowin like ya prayin to the preacher
When I introduce my lil friend
Nice to meet ya
Swiss yo ass up
And I ain't talkin cheese pizza
Catch me out the country

Pussy niggas wassup

( Kidd Kidd ) Verse
Curt Digg wassup nigga
Real niggas do real thangs ya heard me
I told you i got you
Party with killas
Eat with the gangstas
Sleep with the banga case im wakin up to danger
Heart full of anger
My life is too painful
Two devils on each shoulder
Imma war angel
I need that white with 4 angles
Squares on the table
Whippin my wrist like its tryna untangle
I need the paper
A big bank roll
Mask up outside the bank until that bitch close
This is real nigga shit ya can't flush it
When a real nigga talk
Its best ya hush it
Double barrel shotgun
Long as a musket
I fly back two feet when I bust it
In the land of ungrateful and unlucky
My girl say she hate my attitude
I'm like fuck it
The tool that i got on me
It ain't for plumbing
If I let it flash on you
It ain't for stuntin
Naw nigga
