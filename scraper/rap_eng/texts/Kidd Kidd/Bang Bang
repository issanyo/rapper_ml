[Verse:]
Take me from the top fire
And bang i got shot about six times
Bang bang i’ll still ride again on bang bang
Always tell the mother fucking muscle man
G-unit i see you nigga
Fuck with the ms or ride again man
See the fucking baby man
HA!
Shout out to the union
You know what i’m saying man
Now that you fucking with the main man
You know how it is
You about to hear mother fucking name i’m telling you nigers
Ya ya hold up uh
Yeah gramp better buckle up
Two guns double clutch
Way them bitches acting like i’m playing double dutch
Word to my brother buck
I get your brother buck
I can give a twister onto grammy as a mother fuck
In the end i’m mini then when they be blocking
And i’m spending mickey high when you killers
Beat your brain like hot chilly
Nothing sweeter than revenge to shift your trigger finger
Licking i don't like to be touched
Well i don't care if you feelin me i never give up
If i start something i finish
So know if you start something you finish it
You must be on something you trippin
Yeah banana peel you slipping
Teedy hit him put a hole in a sneakers venom
Now it's leakers venom you’re a hole a fake nigga
You kidding i got too much stink i got to keep winning
Go to the church the lord knows i’m gonna keep sinning
The will tinning ninety personnel rock ringing
Ask no question just hop in
We going to slide on something like it's the ninth ending
Special on those when like you dead or when your life ending nigga
And my little niggers ait plaing fair for that sake
Niggers shooting up a day care
The money coming in hoes flock like a state fair
Thought i told you pussy niggers we ain't playing fair
Oh i got niggers out there bumping car
Got niggers like gunning hard
The glitter nice but the cutter hard
No sleep but we can start the yard
Before christmas we were playing with toys
Made a bind to fear no man but God
I’m the streets new landlord
Drop a nigga like a zamphard
Pop the glizzle like a bottle
Kinda treat you like a model
Cut you straight from the sea forth goddle
Have me waiting for the finish line with a towel
Can't respect a bitch nigga cause all he wants is power
Get a bitch it and she’s going to try and run around you
Playing games with my money
Them haters going to come and find you gone
Now i’m a world wide type mother fucker you can stamp at
Silent to the bone and a niggers don't have that
New carbon i got knock his brain throw the snap back
And i don't say too much no homie i ain't with the chit chat
Got cleanses all day we don't battle for shows
A nigga stepped on my toe so i better get a smoke
I’ll been ducking those bitch more than a dope on the low
You know i’m riding for the bling cause we found first
Niggers fuck with my rider
No i pulling first and i let it Glock like man
Cause it got me on my first jam
Put the move on us niggers stand tall till your half a man
Now don't with those words just the true rhyme
All those niggers pop shooters
World relify if a nigga get cough we know
We going to break the code of silence
I told my riders let's get it now or never
I thugging in this cold world
I’m clutching on a baredda
Now got the Glock the big ask make is better
Cause when it come to beef we’ll be spinning like propellers
Any time of the day bitch we bring you like never
The trigger finger hitching so you know we ball whatever
Then we layed back just getting to the money
We living like that these niggers just around stunting
Shout out to my riders ells that call me twenty two
Black all heads shot and that ain't you tennis shoes
Yeah i know why they mad but burner told them that
Call my nigga gun and he’ll be like where you at
Four five with the extension shoes till you start cry
All faith all bad my riders living all that
Still screaming free my niggers hold your hands rest in peace
To all my niggers hold you hands down and show respect nigga
