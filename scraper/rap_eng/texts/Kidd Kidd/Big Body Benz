[Intro: Kidd Kidd]
Uh, man
Remember niggas used to pay bingo?
Like yo man, bingo man, that's my call man, for real (yoon!)
Big body Benz, big body Benz, big body Benz
I say all I ever wanted was a big body Benz
All I ever wanted

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
Killers don't have no conscience, blat, won't think about it
Trap up in them houses, rats, they Mickey Mouses
Gats up in their trousers
Ma came in and gave me a slap
Said she found all that crack under her couches
I can't sleep, Fred Krueger in my dreams
Call niggas all machines, all y'all work for me
And I'd rather work a triple beam than at Burger King
Rob you for your bling-bling, give me all your ching-ching
Flip your pockets from your jeans, make sure I got everything
Before I leave, life's a bitch, and we just havin' a fling
Man this chrome is like a phone, better answer it when it rings
Let it ring 'til it click, empty clip
You can smell me and see I've been through some shit
With my clique
M-Zone, Rida Gang, now these hoes gon' ride the dick
It's because of street fame these bitches know what it is
They gon' say I'm doing my thing when I pull up in that six
Lord knows

[Chorus: Kidd Kidd (50 Cent)]
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz (and a clean set of rims)
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz (and a clean set of rims)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Pushin' coke and bought them Regals and them large DeVilles
Then they got them vapor bitches, I'm like this for real?
Me, I want that big Benz with the emblem in the grill
Start packin' the steel, lettin' niggas know the deal
I want that shit so bad, start thinkin' "who I got to kill?"
That's how a nigga feel when we out there in the field
That Glock was pumpin', paper comin', how can niggas chill?
Barrel link manage gold teeth, put gold all in my grill
Shoot out shit, I rob your bitch, I use her as a shield
Shit, look at the wheels, wooo! Look at the wheels
Chrome two-piece Lorenzos got me lookin' like a mill'
Peace call, if you wanna talk then later we can build, AHH!

[Chorus: Kidd Kidd (50 Cent)]
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz (and a clean set of rims)
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz (and a clean set of rims)

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, sittin' back in my new AMG, smokin' with 2-thou'-15
Golden wrist, few pounds of green
Park this shit, shoot down yo' teams
Now it seems, oh so clear through Beams
Flow so dope, I lean
Fuck you mean? Lucky that you breathe
Choke the leaf
Focus through my new designer lens
Tell her not her friends
Beaucoup dollars spent, new jewels line 'em in
Too cool time to win, I'm on top again
You gon' top me off, excuse me out
Bullshit you about, front, them Rugers out
Face the sword, no risk, no reward
Peace talk won't go nowhere, gets ignored
Price you can't afford, white man at your courts
Get you more, right here like before
Seen it all my life shit end like this
Come back filthy rich, still not guilty, bitch, uh

[Chorus: Kidd Kidd (50 Cent)]
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz (and a clean set of rims)
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz, big body Benz
All I ever wanted was a big body Benz
Big body Benz (and a clean set of rims)

[Outro: Kidd Kidd]
Nigga, knahmean?

Free PJ, free my lil' homie Chucky, y'knahmsayin'?
Straight up and down man, oww!
Free my nigga Red Elway, ya heard me?

Damn, shit real man, we just was all real niggas man
Just out here chasin' our dreams man
Everybody wanna be fly, everybody wanna live flashy youknow'msayin'?
It's all about feedin' the fam, man, straight up and down man
So we gon' do whatever it takes to get it
By any means... {*fades out*}
