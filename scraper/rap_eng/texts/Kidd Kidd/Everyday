[Verse 1]
Pistol and a scale, nigga must get mad
Drugs are in demand, you got work you never fake
You could get called up, you could go to jail
That's why you need a stash for all your b's and for bail
Get your chips up, stack your bunions out
Get the hustle slowed up and get them young'ns out
When those lames start stunting, you wanna take some
Call for a smack to the jaw, baby break some
Got them youngsters on that loud, niggas fuck with me
Shooting choppers like the 18, going on like like Mr T

[Hook]
I'm thugging, I'm outchea going dummy
Same shit everyday, still outchea with my young'ns
With my diamonds, we out here chasing money
They say you get high baby, them groupies love me
I lost another good nigga, that shit muddy
That's why I stay strapped, all my niggas karate
Still with my young niggas tryna get the cake
P9, bitch I'm over here everyday

[Verse 2: Big Trill]
Chicken head, chicken head, hot wings and baloney
Shooting like Ginobli, robbing all your homies
Niggas in the hood be balling like they Kobe
Chrome to your dome bitch, gimme that Rollie
Big Trill, yeah, niggas can't fuck with me
I'm a role model, shoot your head looking up to me
Mouth full of gold, truck full of bricks
Just tryna get some head out of another nigga's bitch
Money, money, I'm tryna make this money
Got your bitch real high, got her nose running
Open up your mouth bitch, time the drink coming
Tricks off the kids, you silly little bunny
I been getting hot, like the end of May
Try your bitch hit me up in the middle of the late
Night bird acting up so I treated her like Ray Ray
This stacking nigga, getting man, no he throwing gay rights

[Hook]
I'm thugging, I'm outchea going dummy
Same shit everyday, still outchea with my young'ns
With my diamonds, we out here chasing money
They say you get high baby, them groupies love me
I lost another good nigga, that shit muddy
That's why I stay strapped, all my niggas karate
Still with my young niggas tryna get the cake
P9, bitch I'm over here everyday
Still with my young niggas tryna get the cake
P9, bitch I'm over here everyday

[Verse 3]
East Xans street, you know where I came from
Out here gang bang, post up with the same gun
I keep is A-1 with all my day ones
I stopped reading the Bible after page one
Knew how to measure a bottle at the age of 1
Even then, I learned how to talk but not to say nothing
Niggas mouth got a play button
Feds coming, Larry Davis if they read something
Head hunting, Papi Mason tryna dead something
Anthony Davis shooting all over your haters something
The head I did it was for head hunting
You running from your main woman, we be face fucking
Yeah I got some but I'm gon' stay hustling
I got shots for this some but I'm gon' stay bucking

[Hook]
I'm thugging, I'm outchea going dummy
Same shit everyday, still outchea with my young'ns
With my diamonds, we out here chasing money
They say you get high baby, them groupies love me
I lost another good nigga, that shit muddy
That's why I stay strapped, all my niggas karate
Still with my young niggas tryna get the cake
P9, bitch I'm over here everyday
