[Verse:]
Right again (right again)
Titty baby with a do n*gga uh-huh I told her
When I woke up this morning we was on the news
That AK 47 knocked him out his shoes
I need to hit me a lick
Let’s go look on Instagram and see who rich
Look at that flick of a wrist
The gunfire flash is like a flick of a pic
On fire like flicks on a Bic
And I just went and made a flick with your bitch
Hater get off of my dick
Ain’t no more room for you in there or to fit
And I could work a brick I could work a brick
Cash me in a pot luck like I’m stirring grits
No dirt on my dish no dirt on my dish
He mean bottle shooting first his bottle don’t miss
Bitches a hit
Trust me you don’t wanna be on that list
I’m looking at Forbes like that should be me on that list
I came out of the money and even that bitch
Oh bitch I know
I don’t think I’m the shit
Cuz thinking is bitch
And everywhere I go I gotta keep a banger
I don’t want no dabs gangstas don’t show love to strangers
Better watch for titty baby cuz he only dangerous
Word on the street
We ain’t go speak on that shit
I know you n*gga’s a snitch
N*gga talk more than a skit
Fuck it I’m calling it quits
You heard I got money cuz bitch you be listening
You see I’m killing em cuz bitch you be witnessing
I know you ain’t innocent I ain’t gonna cover for you
This ain’t imprisonment girl I can’t judge you
But tonight I love you see that what them drugs do
That man got them chains and we wallet
Any blanket we pimp and we pop it
They call that shit [?]
Mama I can’t go to college I ain’t go to college
But see these hoes give me knowledge man they give me knowledge
I ran through a couple wrecks and gave a fuck about it
I seen them flick on his wrist and made him come up out it huh
Rapper’s worst nightmare you bitch you
You know what it is man
Boogie was good and
I was down with the LA
Cutter what up huh
