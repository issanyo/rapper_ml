You don't take no risk
You gotta fight for it until you break your wrist

Thats your charge be a man nigga take you lick
I saw your whore on the ground boy that ain't your bitch
Nigga should be exposed
Not the word but the truth
Most of you niggers just hold your have more holes than you
Get you tops drop unless you drop top on that bentley coupe
Bad ass i should have been locked up with boosie too
Running circles around them like a hoola hoop
Bill cosby ass rappers niggers rudy poop
I ain't going to say a word [x2]
I’m on my grind and i’m going to get what i deserve
Fuck nigga oh wait on a minute bitch i’m making plenty
Half of them officers they thought that i was finish
Now they on my dick because they thought i’m over fifty
He says giggle that's out of the beauty of independence
Now i’m riding down mazeman i remember i use to walk
Remember i use to sell crack in that
When they bust it open it was show
Can't even slap you bitch niggers you might take me to court
I keep my own lady because i keep getting caught
I’m that same nigga infront that night ward
I had shit but now i’m all
You the same nigga smile in my face then talk and blown
Niggers ain't know me
More niggers ain't know me
Ain't that no bullshit
I hope you fall on that toilet seat bitch you know it's murder
Come to me i got teading baby shooting
Screaming oh jeeze
It's going to be a DOA when the police comes on the scene
Make a movie with the clip it's going to be a whole scene
I’m hanging on the beat shopping on that mother fucking pot
These hoes be pop then niggers pop pop
They say kids down here because these niggers be wilding
I say i’m harder than math class
And you don't want these problems
I’m like real niggers word up
Nigga word up if you ain't screaming i’d ride again
Bitch nigga shut up
Make one call a gun i get your bitch ass set up
Pull over them super soaks get your ass wet up
Then we go back up then we go back up
Jump up like what hit the blocks few more time
Got to make sure this shit done
Bitch i run the city look at me i’m spring
A Lot of niggers try but they sure end it
Niggers see me my windows not even tinted
And you can't feel any shoe up in my dozoo where these
Got grip i’m not slipping its kidd kidd

Sound like those shops not ending
Running ass niggers grab a titty from your mother
