Mamma always told me boy, you gon' be somewhere one day
And i'm on my grind, do what I gotta do to get paid
You'd get smoked where I come from nigga that's how we play
No I ain't goin down, I was told that its only one way(And I gotta go up)
Go Up, Go Up, Go Up Go Up
Go Up, Go Up, Go Up Go Up
Go Up, Go Up, Go Up Go Up
Go Up, Go Up, Go Up Go Up

[Verse1: Certi]
Some tell me that I'll never make it
Some tell me that I gotta keep chasin
Niggas talkin like they will when they won't from the bottom to the top, but I started in the basement
I know they talk about your boy like a hot topic
And I started when they did, I just never stopped it
Niggas hustle on the block, just to see a profit
Niggas know you getting money, then they watch them pockets
I'm the best, number one like i'm derrick rose and, pussy Niggas keep talkin' ima expose
Know some niggas that'll shoot, if a nigga owes em'
Didn't think I had talent, so I had to show em
I be spittin' on the mic, like a chick when she deep throat
That shit hot, make a fan catch a heatstroke
Selling music tell the dealer I don't need dope
Cuz i'm bout to blow like a chick that say she need coke
I'm just a nigga on the east side, they got a problem and it's on That's how we ride
I'm bout to make it like the eggs and the bacon
Rolling 10 blunts and put it all in rotation
I was on the corner sellin rocks to the buyers
Watchin' for the cops posted up like a flyer
Ima play hard to the grave with this shit
Put Certi in the game I was made for this shit, what up

[Verse2: KiddKidd]
It ain't a secret man I come from nothin
Hogul was drunk and my daddy was hustlin'
Thirteen i'm thuggin, I'm only trustin' this pistol i'm clutchin
Why am I running if my Niggas gunnin
I was always with the killers that done it
Wanna be fly but they said I was buckey
Gotta get out of this trap that i'm stuck in
Wanted to rap but the flow was too ruckey
And they was too afraid to touch it
I was hot dog with no mustard
Had to grind for it I wasn't lucky
Got the hand out, I was done wit' shufflin
Had the key rollin, and I was truckin it
Yeah life's a bitch and I was fuckin it
Till I got rich, now i'm loving
Nigga had to try hard, just to try
My momma had high hopes, I had hopes on gettin high
Nigga had to get whatever they could get just to get by
I done finally came up, And its a long way down
