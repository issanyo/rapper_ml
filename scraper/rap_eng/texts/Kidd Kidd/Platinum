[Verse 1]
I just wanna go platinum
If I go gold, send me back to Africa
I just wanna see platinum
On my first album
That's all I'm asking
Is just to go platinum
Be a famous rapper
Lights, camera, action
Can a nigga go platinum y'all?
You gotta stop bootlegging like alcohol
Man, I had a dream I was a rap star
Getting that fan's money, fastest cars
The fastest bars, chilling with the baddest bitches
Cameras flicking, you with your family chilling
Smell a good chicken fill your granny's kitchen
Rest in peace [?] she no longer with us
But I seen her so vivid in my vision
She said "Boy, I'm glad you stuck with it"
Huged and kissed me
Said "Go to church, you need some uplifting"
But I'd rather roll up one and get lifted
How could a boy that missed so many Christmases
Be this gifted?
No pot to piss in, it was written
Even a slum dog can get a million
Rap is all politics and no politicians
Claiming he got 'em bricks, man, he probably snitching
They wanna see ma fall but I ain't tripping
Not even if the label tryna clip me
I seen niggas get sign and he still sitting
Had to get a restaurant job, washing dishes
Shit, I ain't going out like that
I'mma get a plaque [?]
Represent Mazant, put my hood on a map
Let the industry know, where real niggas go rap, huh?

[Verse 2]
This rap shit ain't just rap shit
Man, that's like you saying that my rap's shit
You want me unwrapping like a peckish
Back to Mazant packing and wrapping that package
Hoes grabbing my package tryna see where I'm packing
Won't trap me with that po-po-po-po-po-package
Feds wanna trap me, hope The Lord sends me pass
Don't see me packing
I know some niggas in hell who'd love to see me packing
But I'm stacking, stashing and last it
If you ain't hating, why you looking mad then?
You wanna see me make it, where the fuck you at then, ha?
Don't treat me like a husband
I kept it real and always have been
Pardon me for being outlandish
I just wanna live lavish
Two bad bitches and they speaking Spanish
I don't understand a shit they saying but I know I'm smashing
Niggas come to the crib, but they ain't crashing
He ain't flier than me, I've seen a plane crashing
I'm on my private plane just laughing
When I go platinum... ha (When I go platinum)
