[Verse:]
Bout mother fucking time huh
Everybody been like Kidd man
Drop something man drop a CD drop
Man I got y’all, ya hear me, I’m here now
Rapper’s worst nightmare for a reason you bitch you
Right again
Kidd
They used to sleep on me
They checking under their beds now
Rapper’s worst nightmare
They scared now
Looking for a auto n*gga
I hope you bought a Snickers
It’s gonna take awhile
The way they showing off they should take a bow
These n*ggas ain’t real fresh they fake and foul
The chopper hit a n*gga on and did a flagrant foul
I just want to build a team with no sneaks allowed
I wanna be a king with no one trying to take my crown
When you coming up they wanna take you down
With my power get so built up you can’t break it down
Got this game underwater and I’m holding it down till it drown
I’ll remind you with nobody
I got my own sound
And I ain’t trying to be nobody else
I got my own style
Bucking in the crowd goon gone wild
You can tell I’m from the south as soon as I open my mouth
I say you hear me after every sentence
That’s that New Orleans coming out
My n*ggas got it every sentence he never coming out
Rappers dressing like women
I guess they coming out
It’s the kid with the stupid flow I’ll be dumb and out
Everybody wanna know when my album’s coming out
Cuz I was supposed to get a street’s bling and drive street fame
But the politics in this game I can’t explain
So much has been going on
N*ggas stop up the toilet drain
But you can’t stop a moving train
You wouldn’t know joy if it wasn’t for pain
Every rose need the sunshine and the rain
Tattoos on my body frame
Turn on the news see my ride again
I hope this music get us out the game
Before we losing everything we gain
Ain’t no love I shot cupid before he took his aim
I swear shit never change
The streets gonna stay the same
N*ggas wanna kill me hoes throwing slander on my name
Shout out to 50, shout out to Wayne
Cuz without them two n*ggas you wouldn’t even know my name
Rapper’s worst nightmare n*gga ya hear
It’s about time a n*gga come through with this rough shit man
With this rough shit like this here man
You never heard nothing like this before in your fucking life
Don’t put me in the category with none of these n*ggas man for real
And that’s real man
Shout out to everybody that support a n*gga straight up man
Shout out to all my friends ya hear me even though I’m racking
When y’all holla at me I stop and holla
I stop and take every picture sign every autograph
And everything feel me
Cuz I love this shit for real
Cuz I know what I can be doin’
But this is what I’m doin’
I didn’t ask for this, I was meant for this n*gga
Kidd
