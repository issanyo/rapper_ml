Kidd Kidd - Fuk Da Fame - Intro

[Intro - Kidd Kidd]

Can't say it's been a long time coming, cos I been here

[Shout outs - Unknown]

Iceberg what it do fool?

Rider gang

[Verse 1 - Kidd Kidd]

My life is amazed, my hoes should be amazed
All work it pays, I ain't slept in days
Ate like a king, work like a slave
I'll sleep when I'm dead
I know Allahu resting peacefully
In the grave
Shit on these old hoes who play me back
In the days
This that tunnel vision
See the light getting closer
Cut the head off a snake
G.I Joe on these cobras
So focus, only thing that matters to you is the money
A lot of friends came and went, saw it coming
Somebody call G-unit office and tell them I'm ready
50 said sign a killer he know my pen game is deadly
Rest in peace heavy D, we move that D heavy
In the back of a 93' Chevy
Lord grab the wheel 'cos I can't hold it steady
I'm going round in circles like I'm stirring up spaghetti

I'm from New Orleans
Every Sunday is a second line
Everyone deserves a second try
Pray you next in line
I been shot 6 times, it was a televised
Paramedics saying let him die
But his pride won't let him cry
Seen it in her eyes, mama couldn't tell him bye
Real niggas never die
My kids lift me up so I can't let them down
I'mma hold it down

[Bridge - unknown]

I'mma tell them hand this shit
Downtown, downtown


[Verse 2 - Kidd Kidd]

Bitch I'm in my prime
'Bout to transform on them like Optimus Prime
They saying Kidd Kidd 'bout to blow
It's your time
I said you motherfucking right
Your watch working just like mine
Cos I grind, grind, grind
Hustle and hustle
Work and I work and I work
I could of been on a shirt
Come from the swampiest dirt
If we gon flip well I got to go first
I can be street and these rappers so turfed
I can go hard and these rappers so nerfed
Fuck what they holding, I'm after her purse
100 a night and I'm getting that cheque
Fuck all you niggas you get no respect
Pulling me back cos you know I'm a threat
No one is backing, I'm placing all bets
Jump in my lane I'mma take me a tech
Going on tour and I'm taking my techs
2 shows a day then I'm taking a jet
I know they hating but I ain't hit yet
Nigga
'Cos I started from the bottom
Turned a quarter to a dollar
I don't give a fuck about them
On a porch with that choppa
Turning dope out the lobby
Nigga just caught a body
You say you don't feel my shit
Still went out an bought a copy, boy
Nigga get hot
[?]
Nigga, tell them what the fuck you want
Nigga what the fuck you want?
Real niggas fuck with me
And I don't give a fuck who don't
Watch 'em turn up on these niggas
Watch 'em turn up on these hoes
I might pull up in a rolls
Roll out with the bullet nose
Dragging minks on the floor
Spilling drinks on the floor
VIP at the door
Made a million of a song
When you getting hella dough
Bitches never tell you no
Niggas rather sell it, sold
I'll never tell a soul
Money on the counter
Money counter doing it till it broke
[?] roll another one
You got one already rolled

(Kidd Kidd- Outro)
