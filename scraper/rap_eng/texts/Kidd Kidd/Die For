[Intro: Kidd Kidd]
You heard about me nigga
Kidd Kidd, hashtag RG nigga
Yeah, this gangsta shit

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
Uh, kick the door down to the place, gun up in your face, barrel in your mouth, tell me how it taste
Don't wait, take me to the safe, gun off safe, no trace, mask on my face, this a cold case
Gun still on my waist, jumping gates, draw me an escape, gotta run away, throw this gun away..
Told Marlo run another way, take his son away on a sunny day, from a stray-Duck when the guns spray
Thank God for another day, I'm an ape like bape, put your face on my shirt 8 by 8, before I wine I bust your grape
Fuck a nigga up like I made a mistake so don't think it can't happen to ya
Dem hoes in ya ear yappin' to ya, hanatize gon' happen to ya, homicide askin' what happened to ya
That Rider Gang got kill folk, this mean you don't wax nigga, dont ask niggas what I'm here for, ahh

[Hook]
If you a real nigga then you heard about me, this the shit that I live for
My money I die for, my money I die for
If you a real nigga then you heard about me, this the shit that we live for
My money I die for, my money I die for, huh

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
Boss up, closed mouths don't get fed, talk up
That nine, nine no golf club, leave heads flying like saucers, AHH
That's my bitch like I bought her, I beat that like fuck her
That's your bad you can't fuck her, bitch nigga, fish bait, bitch made, switch blade cut a nigga every which way
Which leg get Kunta Kinte, which rapper ditch imma dig today?
N/A when it come to the name, not available when the phone ring, that's about caine
Real nigga never gon' change, run my own game, do my own thing, can't be worried bout the wrong thing
Trigger play then I'm on game, talkin' rap and I trap, that's the wrong game
Talkin' bout he want a eight, I said a pool ball, I can tell he was through all, man niggas lame

[Hook]
