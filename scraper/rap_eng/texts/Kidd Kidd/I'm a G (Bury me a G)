When I die hope my soul don't fry
Lord knows I done tried
On my grind, pyrex on that fire
Money on my mind, look in my eye
You can see I'm high, bitch, respect my mind
Step aside, you ain't 'bout that life
You just tryna rhyme, my bitch would die
And she keep an eye, hand her 9 to 5
I wanna fuck, she gonna give it up
She don't waste no time, doing fine
I'm dumping shots, one of a kind
You must be blind, can't see me shine
The world is mine

[Hook:]

I'm a G, bury me a G
In a pair of sneaks, fresh tee
True religion jeans, man, I rest in peace
Bitch, I'm a G, bury me a G
Bitch, remember me, bitch, I'm a G
Bury me a G, bury me a G
Yeah, I'm a G, bury me a G
In a pair of sneaks, fresh tee
True religion jeans, man, I rest in peace
Man, I'm a G, bury me a G
Bitch, remember me, bitch, I'm a G
Bury me a G, bury me a G

Flipping coke back when I was broke
All I had was hope
Selling dreams, I'm selling soap
Just until I scope
Got my dough, now I want some more
You know how I go, hit the floor
Move or get smoked, it ain't a joke
Boy, I need cheese like pizza, pizza
Gimme all your cash and Visas
Introduce my millimeter, please to meet you
It's wrong but life goes on
Another song, sing along
One to the dome, that nigga gone, leave me alone
I'm in my zone, them zone I'm repping, it's my own
I'm never stepping without my chrome
Shit is real, I'm in that field
I might get killed, I'm overdue
Before I do, I need a mil'

[Hook:]

I ain't gotta tell you, bitch, I'mma show you
Nobody know you, heavy metal, we rock and rollers
We pop them coasters in your section
Go fuck that ' we split the dough up, we young soldiers
15 and older, nobody told us
If they did, we wouldn't notice, we on that corner getting loaded
This pistol loaded, I heard your crib is fully loaded, we 'bout to go in
Mask on, kick the door in, which room the dough in?
We in them streets, beefing never cease
Rest in peace, man, I'd rather you instead of me
I can never be, play it like a sucker, never me
I'm a G, kept it G, you know where I'm from, 9th ward to the death of me

[Hook]
