[Verse 1]
Big bankroll, that's what the bank told
Went, drew my cash and I was in there till the bank closed
Man they lame old, they still hitting them same hoes
I'm like ? same old same old
Can't believe I'm this fly like Criss Angel
Your bitch lay you in the air, at a thirty degree angle
You're talking Japanese, I speak cashenese
Talk cash to me cause you don't want no casualty, huh
Yeah all my dogs about their
You niggas pussy, all your dogs got cats
Your whole house filled with rats
Yeah you heard we got it for cheap like outlets

[Hook]
Big bankroll, we getting change ho
I wanna ball hard, put me in the game coach
And imma' win the game coach
You need me to win the game coach
Big bankroll, we getting change ho
I wanna ball hard, put me in the game coach
And imma' win the game coach
You need me to win the game coach

[Verse 2]
Baby mama's tripping, trying to take me check
Child support papers, she heard I got paper
The speculators, commentators out there hating
Like I can't blow, I hold my detonator
Couldn't get up on my level with an elevator
Better step up your game fast like escalators
I'm gonna pull this big thing fast, then levitate you
Hot v's in your veins, hope the respirators work
That's now or later, check it I'm the candy man
And I'm connected round' the board like it's Candyland
I be in that spot, where it's twenty a block
Your young ho up on my jock, don't cock block
Glock cocked, ? knock off the top
Yeah we cop drop tops, off the lot, don't mop
? the motto, we keep a big bankroll
Known as the fiends, need a fix ?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It ain't hard to see, I'm doing my thing
Look at Kidd, black ass all you see is his chain
We getting ? that's popping like a pimple, and she gonna give me dental
I made her show her dimple, this the Rider gang
We get the bottles man
Make it rain like we just won the lotto man
You got a good chance to be signed, you don't gotta slang
Like a mouth of change, nigga I'm bout this change, huh

[Hook]
