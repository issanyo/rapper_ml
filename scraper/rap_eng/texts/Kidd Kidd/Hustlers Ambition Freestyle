[Intro]

Nigga  it run
Nigga in the dope For real

[Verse]
New Orleans, gotta thank for this gansta shit
They love me, free Kevel, free weed
Free my nigga Chucky Stay and screaming fuck the jury
Only God could judge me
Know you niggas coming with me if you coming with me
Climb these walls
Pistol punk and feeling lucky
But these days quaking like sharky
Dughy Told my son
Gotta hold a gun before doing the duggy
Haters know you daddy getting money
If you gonna talk reckless, don’t be a dumb
I know nigga for years
Gotta a bigger head to change dumb like new hunnids
Losing in Alaska
You acting funny You may privilege the hot spot you
Treasure bout me I come from nothing
Stunning, running, hungry
Now I’m shit, I dot the bubbles MC with that hammer boy
You can’t touch me They got me up on my hit shit
Put my hover in your face then
I’m asking chasing Shooters like Anthony Davis
Let the ballers could fly On that scoll face shit Play with me
You’ll be world all famous

[Outro]
You know what it is man
Pass that motherfucker cover
We are here I ain’t a fresh man
But I’ma take just the cola Yeah
I was kidding, I need you, I need you to hate me
