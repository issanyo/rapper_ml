[Verse:]
Yeah rapper's worst nightmare
Know what i mean you have a few memories man
Let me take y'all back you heard me
And let me take you back to where my homie fat tram was living you heard me
Rest in peace to my nigga for real for real
No ain't nothing like that first time when i held a nine
My uncle gun i had to be about eight or nine
They use to put it in my palm but never let me squeeze
I use to watch them empty clip on new year's eve
Little did they know i had a trick up under my sleeve
I steal it from them as soon as they fall asleep
Fast forward i got all the jalapenos in the streets
Looking for something to eat
I ain't got no money i’m looking for something for free
Going hard to find a bag of regular weed
My nigga read read out of plain it was more like scam
Say he want to jack some i’m like yeah
The kind of situation that turns a boy into a man
So i guess tonight i’m going to find out how old i am
No skee mask heart beating fast
Done and gone from the sweat dripping from my hand

[Chorus:]
Cause i’ve never did this before
I’ve never did this before no I’ve never done this before no [x3]
I’ve never did this before no i remember this bad bitch

[Verse 2:]
She was off the chain she would always let me fuck but never
Give me brains she use to say uhhh thats nasty
Say you wouldn't be cutting school if were that classic
Unbuckle my school blue dickie car keys on the back streets
Always stay street on the back seat like we were in a drag meet
For a daam week the ac cause i can’t breathe
I’m getting too hot baby you so little no one can’t see
She said i don't do that i reply like a ceiling fan like
Not you i heard about you stop playing what them all going to do

[Chorus:]
Cause i know you did this before
Acting like he did this before
Yea i know you did this before  [x4]
Cause he acting like he did this before
Yea i know you did this before
A matter of fact you know what i’m saying about your boy man
