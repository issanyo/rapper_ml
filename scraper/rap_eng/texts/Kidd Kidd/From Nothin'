[Intro]
I come from nothing
The bottom nigga
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Watch your Kidd fuck up the game
Everybody won't sound the same
Seen him go quicker, Dany Kane
Real nigga, Fuk Da Fame
I can't change, my zip code gonna stay the same
I got hit from right ? and I ain't ashamed
Rida Gang, on everything we gonna eat
Hold up smell some stink, can't let your boo she get the meat
So used to not having shit, told myself I wouldn't have any
Marshawn Lynch I got the ball, not dare nigga try to tackle me
All my hitters on side of me, I don't like niggas in the back of me
Throwing dirt on my name, I swear them haters want to bury me
I wore holes in my clothes, ? knows with no hoes
My momma still on section eight, he was broke I had to work the stove

[Hook 1]
I come from nothin'
Come from nothin'
From nothin', I came up from hustlin'
(From nothin', nothin'
From nothin', I came up or hustlin') x2
From nothin', nothin'
Nothin', I came up from hustlin'

[Verse 2]
Say fuck, rather hit the block
Got the same watch that 50 got
Board is yall ho 50 shots
From all the holes you got you look poker die
Catch me at the dope spot, fuck the world like 2Pac
My six-shot got 2 shots, had to leave forward up in due time
Niggas talking like 2 cops, handcuffing like 2 cops
She on the knees like 2 sacks, cut her short like crew socks
Kidd Kidd you're too high, worldwide touring you get money now
So you're acting funny now ? They begging everytime I come around
My ex want to fuck me now, but I get to her to run around
Told all of her goons what goes around comes around
And I was rich when she spied around
Talking 'bout you wanna live something, well suck a nigga dick or some
Hold a nigga brick or some, bring another bitch or some
Got signed and I'm still thuggin', got shot and I'm still buckin'
God got a fear from me, nobody want to hear from me
My nigga tried to steal from me, now he can't get shit from me
Seen him now and he's still bumin', and we both came up with nothin'

[Hook 2]
(From nothin', nothin'
Nothin', I came up or hustlin'
Nothin', from nothin'
From nothin', I came up from hustlin'
Nothin', nothin'
Nothin', I came up from hustlin'
Nothin', nothin'
From nothin', I came up from hustlin') x2
