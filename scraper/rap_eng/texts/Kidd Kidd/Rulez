[Intro]
I ain't even playing though, like
I'm not playing

[Verse 1]
I'm rippin', runnin' for the money, can't send another nigga for me
I got that forty on my waist, I couldn't afford another case
I need to own a real estate, I'm puttin' all y'all in your place
They tellin' me that I'm gassed up, well give me forty on eight
Back up, lil bitty bitch back up, don't be greedy, we all can get a plate
You in good hands with Allstate, I'm in good hands in all states
I had to manage the hallway, cut the grass for the yard snake
I was on your 'Gram all day, I don't care if it's all fake
Take your bitch like Scarface, leave a nigga with the Jordan face
She blowing on me like hot soup, I know crips and the pirus
When you keep it fifty times two, real niggas recognize you
Poured a deuce in a Mountain Dew, haters say they gon' stop who?
Dare a nigga touch my food, chopper give his ass a mouthful
Everybody say they want beef, but they only talk a lot a bull
Before I ever go by the rules, I'll fuck around and buy the school
Kidd

[Chorus]
Before I ever go by the rules
They gon' have to kick me out the school
And I got a whole lot to lose
I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose, I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose
I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose, I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose

[Verse 2]
I ain't got nothin' to prove
You still gotta get shit approved
You just ain't got shit to do
Gave my brother all my tennis shoes
Went and got some more Jimmy Choo's
Nigga neck all iced up, looking like a Sub-Zero finish move
Wrist cold and I'm really cool, And you can't tell me what to do
I'ma stand on my own two, I'm a man just like you
Michael Jackson bust a lot of moves
Just to get the one power move
So you know I don't play by the rules (hell no nigga), yeah

[Chorus]
Before I ever go by the rules
They gon' have to kick me out the school
And I got a whole lot to lose
I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose, I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose
I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose, I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose
Before I ever go by the rules
They gon' have to kick me out the school
And I got a whole lot to lose
I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose, I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose
I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose, I'ma win, I ain't 'bout to lose
