Nigga, you better walk
Cause I ain't into talking
I hit you up
I put you in your coffin
You see with me? It's really not a game man
I hit them up
Lay them down
Bang bang
(2x)

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
This around shack where's is at?
Click clack gimme dat POW POW BAP BAP THAT'S THAT!
Let my chiddy bang bang, I ain't wit da chitta chat
Play my role script was that the code I'm a stick with that
Been made my mind up to be the first dumpin'
Since a nigga shot at me right after we jumped him
I told Tity, Baby, and Mane not to touch 'em
I used fuck wit 'em, now I'm like fuck 'em
Dick in the dust, my rider's gon' do it
Real nigga shit I give 'em the gun to do it
Nigga shit real you can die over your music
Whatchu gon do kill a nigga youtube it it look stupid nigga
You, you, you, and you a bitch
Now look how I played you..like I do a bitch
I don't talk it, I walk it, put your coffin on an auction
My zodiac sign says caution, nigga

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
Just cause you pussy nigga you ain't got nine lives
I pack 50 shots you get hit 'bout 30 times
Ready N.Y. time, ownin' L.A. time
Time pickin' you, another dead body found
Another day, another died, triple murder homicide
You can stay on the side now your family jeopardized
You ain't 'bout this gangsta shit, I can see it in your eyes
Matter fact I can't, talking with your head down
M-zone gangsta Rida Gang Lone Ranger
Hand in his pocket, keep his fingers on his banger
Don't sit behind me, see I don't trust strangers
For the green I turn also, don't make me angry
You got splenda in your gender, pussy in your persona
Screamin' at ya so hard but sounding like Rihanna
You don't even add up, I know you don't the problems
I can hit a nigga wit a choppa from a chopper

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
I'm that bad kid nobody never wanted to play with
Tryna do somethin' evil and get away with
Growing up I wasn't always the family favorite
Now they don't say shit, cause I'm famous
I hit the block I wanna see ankles spraining
I'm aimed and cocked, I'm Bangkok dangerous
Don't run for cover, run for your gun!
And if you ain't got one... run
Stick a fork in that nigga, he's done
You pussy, cause you don't get none like a nun
Like Lennox with the ox I murder for fun
Don't charge me with Murder-One, cause I'm a murder some
Uh..yeah, yeah murderer, murderer
Light 'em up, light 'em up, burn 'em up burn 'er up
Niggas just talkin' shit, I ain't never heard of ya
Keep walkin' or be a wheelchair purchaser
