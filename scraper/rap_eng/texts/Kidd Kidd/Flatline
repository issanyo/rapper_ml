[Verse:]
Don't waste my time
You ain't talking bout money lil boy don't ring my line
You not what you pretending to be Better stop that lying
One of your medulla ever stole that medusa thats so flatline
The early bird get the bread and I want mine
Tap a nigga go shed cause they want to shine
Like a boy on a skates i been on the grind
Everything i see is certified
Put you in the ground keep fertilized
Watch your home get burglarized
You bitch all on my dick
I get her off like i'm circumcised
Surprise no bow tie
I work hard man Im so tired
All i do rap for you
Then i change on you like a blown tyre
We blowing them trees
Fuck prevent forest fire
Niggas we them Gs
Were on a gang and them levers rock [x8]
Can't cross that line
I'll be waiting at the lake and bake
With a all black nine
I'm putting work on the road
You don’t see the construction signs
Now you labor on my dick
Got that foreign yea they want me to try
Tell them 20mil won't get a sign
What the fuck they talkin bout
They gon’ make me bring New Orleans out
Turn this bitch into a horny house
Hear me and they all in doubt
You a bitch I can call it out
If you is a problem I can solve it out
I got the cold shit
Make a nigga froze
Heard they was sleep
Heard they let em all know
Cut me with that line make the speakers overload
Tell me shit make a dyke bitch take off her clothes
Chill out you ain't no shooter
Catch you on the skateboard or the skooter
Putting hoes over bros what they do you
Say they ride for you
Tell em where to sue you
Ain't my dog ain't my round
Where the hell you was when it all went down
You’s a phone you was probably layin this pussy
If you was you probably say I wasn't looking
Studio gangsters, studio gangsters
That's what I don't like
Made that much a show called street rep
That shit was a bunch of hype
Why them niggas over there boom show off
Is it because of the ice
Well the cutter’s in the car now
This how you wanna end your life?
Take a sample of quick crime
Gimme that fuckin pacifier
Just started then we made it retire
Tell them hoes i got years under my stripe
And i still on that lake
With that pack nine
Era game, rally gang can't save em with a flat line
