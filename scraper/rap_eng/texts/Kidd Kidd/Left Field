[Intro]
I'mma come hard on this bitch now, you digg ?
My nigga told me I need to build a left field with it
So cause a left field with it
Fuk Da Fame
Kidd

[Verse 1]
You're pimpin' keep it pimpin'
My dog said he fallin' man he trippin'
You can say fuck love when you ain't in it
Everybody want commitment but not commited
Can't find that one when this one too many
Nigga who you tellin' my phone feels plenty
Over possessive woman, tell me how do you miss me when you texting me every minute
Project bitches act like they can't miss him
Baby daddy in prison looking for a ticket
How their mama house screwed up with them children
So they're at the top, they put their layers thru the ceiling
Models up in the gym working on their fitness
But that don't mean nothing 'cause they still gonna buy some titties
School girl tryin' to pay back tuition
Hard working woman, mix pleasure with business

[Chorus]
How many couples in here tonight ?
I hear crickets
But if I asks you's fucking tonight
They might start strippin'
Riri said be unfaithful
And Bey said irreplaceable
And you bump that shit all day
How else I'm supposed to take it tho
How else I'm supposed to take it tho
I mean how I supposed to take it tho
How else I'm supposed to take it tho
I mean how I supposed to take it tho

[Verse 1]
Tell my ? You're gonna stay with drama
Every girl want a man if they ain't got one
So I keep problems for some hoes that I dated that was very outdated
Now you're chasing me around the car like Diddy
Calling up my dog pimping up these hoes crazy
And your girl shady
She's gonna say she loved but we all but she hated
Just to look you up with some niggas to play me
So she can say you ain't better than none of them
Go save yourself shawty be one of them
We had to separate to be one again
Cross the finish line to run again
Here we go once again
Going thru my phone like you work at Sprint

[Chorus 2]
How many couples in here tonight ?
Ok thank you come again
Riri said bae unfaithful
And Bey said I'm replacable
And you bump that shit all day long
How else I'm supposed to take it tho
How else I'm supposed to take it tho
I mean how I supposed to take it tho
How else I'm supposed to take it tho
I mean how I supposed to take it

[Outro]
You know what I'm saying
You hear me
You learn a lot from fucking music my nigga
I'm telling you, you hear me
Music controls the world man
Music controls everybody, music make niggas get out there and trap all day
Music can make your girl fuck your best friend if the song sounds good enough
Believe that, you hear me
Fuk Da Fame, yeah, Ha
Fire on the track nigga, you hear me ?
American trappstar shit man, Rida Gang
Fuck trying we're doing
