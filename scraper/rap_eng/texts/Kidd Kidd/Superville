[Intro]
Fatality, fatality
(Whoo Kid)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I bet all these classics make the city flip
Drop committees quick
Grip on all my Rocky willie shit
Knock you silly with
Hammers off my block affiliate
My fascination grew to snatch your paper crew
Bash your faces too, toolie kept
Candy at a movie set
Slept on me, I haunt you now
Leather seats, gas and horses round
Pass the torches, how
South Jamaican nigga, course I'm foul
Take that cross the street
Pay me cash and the cost is steep
Nigga talk is cheap

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
There's two ways to life, most end up dead or in jail
The lil homies got a cravin' ass appetite
Water boilin', stove open on them cold nights
And if a nigga ain't strapped he ain't rollin' right
Gotta check my rear view for them blue and whites
T.D. Jakes keep preachin' bout that street life
He get me goin' in the mornin', got my mind right

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
I got a bulletproof plan, you understand?
I've been through hell already I'm supposed to be the man
Drop Lamb', lil nigga on the rise
I body drop 'em every day and we don't sympathize
Speedin' is my drive, one and only still
Feel like they owe me, will, get on my OD, kill
If you approach me niggas know we got the realest shit
Paper stacks to hurt your feelings with
Nothin' changed, they hearin' it

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Niggas talk behind your back when you're not lookin'
Run up on 'em ask 'em what's shakin' and get shookin'
Ain't nobody gave me the game I just took it
Then I started my own gang like Tookie
Last thing you seen was a Rida Gang hoodie (huh?)
Them toys talk like Woody
I'm hood like an uncle ass whoopin'
Never got my chain tooken, crack cocaine cookin'
Put one in your head like I'm nookie

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
Apply pressure with this needle to they blood vessel
Supplyin' what they put inside they straight shooter
Raid outta Texas tryna die, state troopers
Your life's on the line when you're sellin' they Frank Lucas
But my bills on time and my bitches even they shooters
Pop a molly with you and put two in your medullas
These pussy niggas programmed like computers
My son got a tutor and a flooded Frank Mueller (wooo!)
