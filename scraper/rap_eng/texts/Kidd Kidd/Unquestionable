[Intro]
Unquestionable, uh, that mean
You can't question nothin' about me, my nigga
Niggas say what the fuck they want
But they'll never say what you really did
These hoes gon' always say what the fuck they want
But they ain't gon' never say how you fucked 'em
Man, thank y'all for rockin' with the realest
Thanks for rockin' with the real, yeah

[Verse]
I got my shit together
I'm on a whole 'nother level
My money balanced and leveled
Fuck all you niggas, I feel like a rebel
On my Tee Grizzley, do this with no effort
All these bitches like I run an escort
Feelin' so special, so special, so special
Hoes'll wan' tell you, the one I'm more jealous
I just went bought some new Maison Margielas
I just put stones in my chain, Barney Rubble
Feds wan' indict me, they say I embezzle
All of these diamonds all over my bezzle
All of the hatin' that done brought the devil
I'm just tryna make it out of the ghetto
Encounter snakes like I walk through the desert
Boy you too fake like you made by Geppetto
When my ho crossed me I should've knew better
My mama told me that I could do better
Fuck all the oppers, they know it's whatever
I don't call no coppers or run to no helpers
I been some places where niggas could never
I kept it modest, I ain't with the extra
And to be honest you gettin' me fed up
You too far behind us to try and play catch up
I'm never stoppin', I'm never gon' let up
They tried to knock me, it all was a set-up
They want the animal locked in a cellar
On them moonrocks, I feel like Interstellar
Fresh off the island, just met me a Stella
Gave her her groove back, one two and I stepped her
Take your shoe back Cinderella
Got so much pain in this rain, it poured through the umbrella
I'm supercharged like a Tesla
I shoot your neck off, word to Uncle Fester
All of these rats got my city infested
Hate is contagious, I know you infected
I spit that dope like a lethal injection
I get that check like I'm bein' corrected
Free all my real niggas out correction
I had to kneel down, count my blessings
My hope was gettin' dark as my complexion
Baby mama callin', nigga stressin'
I can't talk, gotta text me
It'll overwhelm you if you let it
You gassed up, unleaded
You done just what I expected
More mine cash, that bitch credit
I'm authentic, you synthetic
His starving is pathetic
Bring the beat back, I'ma catch it
Coming back like I forget it
Once the beef starts, you can't dead it
Gotta walk around with your weapon
Gotta stand your ground like in Florida
Nigga Trayvon Martin you
Throw a parade like Mardi Gras
Second line to the coroner
I'm a buyer, not a borrower
I'm a leader, not a follower
You just tweaking for some followers
Swear they wanna bring it out of you
Headshot, you a vegetable
And they wanna talk down on you
But your life's unquestionable
