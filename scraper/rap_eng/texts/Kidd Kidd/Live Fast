[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
If there's a problem then it's on sight
Hope somebody cares about 'em, 24 hours wildin'
There be violence around here all night
We ready for the battle with the shit we can paddle
Though when you show up it's a DOA
Everybody cryin'  to your family, you lyin'
Won't a damn thing be ok
Look what I'm becoming
Won't be slowing down for nothing

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Look, I got them buggin' fuck out, been glowin' lately
Middle of the ring when they droppin', I know I'm crazy
The horror's too much to stomach, he'll vomit maybe
A bunch of rules we abolish, narcotic babies
Took a posse of loonies, [?] to raise me
The odds were shaky
My heart's still breaking, scarred homies you had to take 'em
[?] around, get your organs sliced
Autopsy read, you wasted all your life
It beez like that, just one of them nights
I bet them people crackin' goin' for white
Where them clappin' on the corner
Can't seem to last, too long a fight
You'd rather kill then leave here wrong or right
Just make ya way, only the strong unite
Whip through your neighborhood all in spite

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
If there's a problem then it's on sight
Hope somebody cares about 'em, 24 hours wildin'
There be violence around here all night
We ready for the battle with the shit we can paddle
Though when you show up it's a DOA
Everybody cryin'  to your family, you lyin'
Won't a damn thing be ok
Look what I'm becoming
Won't be slowing down for nothing

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
Miss me with 'em candy rappers, I'm not them other suckers
I probably fucked your baby mother, I'm a motherfucker
No loyalty among thieves, just too emotional
Your heart on your sleeve
With mood swings, bobbin' your weave
Bit the apple after Eve, man, I got no soul
I'm around from the crossroad, Jesus piece, rose gold
You got Pinocchio nose, you only sold in your flow
I'm on that cold corner bumpin' Cold Corner by my bro
Got it for the low on the low
Even if I don't blow, I got blow
Your hoe detonate and watch her blow
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
Which one of y'all got to go?
Cop asked me what they shot me for
I told 'em bitches I don't know

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
If there's a problem then it's on sight
Hope somebody cares about 'em, 24 hours wildin'
There be violence around here all night
We ready for the battle with the shit we can paddle
Though when you show up it's a DOA
Everybody cryin'  to your family, you lyin'
Won't a damn thing be ok
Look what I'm becoming
Won't be slowing down for nothing

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
Humble beginnings in a crack team
But everything changed when the money came
We went from duckin' the NARCs to condos in Battery Park
Send my bitch to DR, she done up
Her ass and her breasts sick
I feel like Fat Cat in '86
A hundred bricks for that yard stick quality
Drought come we got enough to raise the economy
Bomb first 'cause these haters ain't harmin' me
Forward thinkin' so the past don't bother me
Where I'm from victory is survival
And snitches on the stand with their hand on the Bible
To be or not to be, that's the question
I'm out to get it, obstacles in my direction
No new friends 'cause these fake niggas snitchin'
We hold trial in the streets and the jurors is the henchmen

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
If there's a problem then it's on sight
Hope somebody cares about 'em, 24 hours wildin'
There be violence around here all night
We ready for the battle with the shit we can paddle
Though when you show up it's a DOA
Everybody cryin'  to your family, you lyin'
Won't a damn thing be ok
Look what I'm becoming
Won't be slowing down for nothing

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
Ay Banks, I've been sellin' dope out my mama house
I think she knowin' what I'm doin'
She be lookin' while I'm cookin'
Got 'em comin' in and goin out
One of my partners went to catch a brick, playin', got it tooken
I got codeine pourin' out
I'm double cupped up, dopeboy
I used the fishscale to hook 'em
I got young pigs showin' out (shorty, showin out)
I just told 'em find some flights, I'ma book 'em
I got pounds in my hoe's house
Servin on my granny porch
Got a pair of doctor bill, I ain't have no choice
Connected with the coke like I was from Miami, boy
So much dope if you fuck up they kill your family, boy

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
If there's a problem then it's on sight
Hope somebody cares about 'em, 24 hours wildin'
There be violence around here all night
We ready for the battle with the shit we can paddle
Though when you show up it's a DOA
Everybody cryin'  to your family, you lyin'
Won't a damn thing be ok
Look what I'm becoming
Won't be slowing down for nothing
