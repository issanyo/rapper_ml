[Verse 1]
Tattoos, over my bullet wounds
Got wolves in my hood, they hollering at the moon
Hear em' growlin', they prowlin' for food
Young-ens got two's, they don't even know how to use
Friends or ends, pick or choose
Cause niggas switch crews, when they in different moods
Her ain't a winner, ain't got shit to loose
And you ain't shit to me, I ain't got shit to prove
You in the penthouse suite, we got different views
I'm out in that streets with that work, giving interviews
You wanna the woulda-coulda-shoulda-dude's
Better do what you would, coulda, should do
Stay on your toes, watch how you move
Watch these ho's, cause bitches will get you killed too
Hood news, ain't ever good news
From nigga [?]
Tried to rung us, he didn't have a good pair of shoes
He was high but blunts don't come with parachutes
They say I'm nuts, like cashews
Everything around me, cash rules
Do what you have to
Blast him, before he blast you

[Hook]
Tattoos over my bullet wounds
Tattoos over my bullet wounds
Wolves in the hood, they hollerin at the moon
Tattoos over my bullet wounds
Wolves in the hood, they hollerin at the moon


[Verse 2]
Picture you gettin' hit, wearing a shitbag on you
And the people you was running with, ran on you
Niggas you were gettin' cheese with, ratted on you
Cheesin' in your face, but ain't happy for you
You say let me hold something, they swear they had it for you
And when you ask em' for it, they don't have it for you
Guess it ain't in their genes, they slackin' on you
When you broke, you a joke, they crackin' on you
But now you doin' shows and they clappin for you
Ho's used to ignore you, but now they asking for you
I see life through old J's eyes
Cuttin' down that white girl, crossin' state lines
They say take your time, but that's a waste of time
Cause everybody eatin' while you waiting in line
My nigga ate mine, like it ain't mine
Made up my mind, then my nine hit em' eight times
Here's the difference between living and surviving
Being dead and dying
When you living, you good feeling comfortable
When you surviving, you take what ever coming to you
When you dead, you dead weight, who carrying you?
But when you dying, you got a chance to improve


[Hook]
