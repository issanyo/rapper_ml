[Verse:]
This is for all my niggers who stuck with me through thick and thin
When everybody else side against me you heard muscle what up
This is for every body who though a nigga was’nt going to be shit
Ah ha straight up
From where i’m from
You know what i’m saying rider
Rain that shit man
Mama i follow my dream
Now i’m on the cover of the magazine
They got to see it to believe it cause they can't read
Got to be fair fuck the instagram feed
They ask me why i don't follow them because i rather lead
Hanging pictures on my wall
My daddy has my pictures on his walls too doing light behind ball boy
Collect calls yeah i accept the charge
Bitch a few stones to keep money on the phone
City telling me to go hard or go home
I told them nigga i ain't never home
I use to sail on the rocks to the rocks stars now
I’m at the top hanging with the rock stars
Only lights i was use to is the cop cars
Now i don't even show my licence to cops cause
My birthday was the worst days but
Now a nigga caking i never obey what the church says but
I’m praying that i make it
My baby moma wishing death on me
I’m in the booth recording with a tech on me
I throw high water to who ever slept on me
Rose in the concrete ya’ll stepped on me
Haters want me to fall so they can rap on me
When i got shot you ain't even checked on me
To my old hoes i’m back bitches
I got that cheque on me but you get nothing but dick only
And i ain't fucking with you hoe nigga
Its ya’ll fall if you broke niggers
You know very well who you are
And i know you down reach for the stars
And anything and making money
Shawty you're all i want
I know you want me too ohhhh
For real though
Fuck it you heard me
Houla at your boy man
Double ex men cover
I ain't a freshman but i’ll take that cover though
You heard me now
I know you mother fuckers ain't fucking with me anyways
2015 baby and i’m still here man you heard me
You dig hashtag hard G hashtag but must be a bitch you
Riding down with the g-unit nigga you know what it is
You heard
Get that beef get that beef nigga
Fucking beauty and the pinners
You know what i’m saying
It is what it is man
Ride again die
Free  lil chuckie too
