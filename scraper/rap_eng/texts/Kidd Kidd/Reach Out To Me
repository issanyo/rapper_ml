[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
I'm laughing to the bank, not to be funny
Bread all around the board like Monopoly money
But how can I eat good when everybody hungry?
You not a reallionaire, you don't keep it a hundred
Big diff between wifey and bitches I fuck with
My real friends is niggas I'm just stuck with
I rapped with Lil Wayne, but I ain't stunted
I can always go back cause I never fronted
You ain't up in the hood, you just checked under it
I'm on the way home, [?] I'm coming
Liquor shot in the air for my little cousin
I hope the bullet land on the head of who done it
You would get punched from thinking these lines punches
This is food for thought like school lunches
My moms abandoned me, but I still love her
You don't have to wonder, you my Wonder Woman
I took my nothings and made something from it
Got a pot to piss in, but the toilet wasn't flushing
I started hustling, told to slow down, but I was rushing
I was being more [?] than a Russian
I had to shallow my rocks when the laws was coming
Then threw 'em up and got back to pumping
On the corner where the streets chris cross
Yeah, the block was jumping
That was back then, I had fat racks then
We had each other backs back then like I wish a nigga would jump in
Uh, now guns blowing like second line band trumpets
Niggas staring like ''and what, bitch?
I was born with talent, I'm glad it found me
Before a casket or a bounty
Haters can't talk to me so they talk about me
Now they praying Kidd Kidd reach out to me
Haan
