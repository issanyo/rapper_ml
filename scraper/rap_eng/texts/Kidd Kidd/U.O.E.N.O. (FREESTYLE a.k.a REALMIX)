[Verse 1]
I'm giving y'all real shit, yeen ain't even know it
You just like the way I spit, so you ignore it
Wayne messed up off that lean, and I'm still pourin
My P.O. piss testing me, but I'm still smokin
Before rap nigga I was a crack dealer, yeen ain't even know it
Why scrap with you, pull a gat quicker, yeen ain't even totin
Pay a thousand dollars for a pair of pants, yeen ain't even know it
You saw the tag and you walked past, couldn't even afford it
That Rida Gang what I claim, that's my slogan
Feel squirt off, with the shirt off, quicker than Hulk Hogan
This rap beef is just rap beef, I ain't even worried
I know real killers that's after me, and I ain't even worried
My mixtape a whole masterpiece, but you don't even know it
Something that Tyson be glad to see, can't even show him
I'm outside, park where you sleep, you don't even know it
Look how a nigga got you on beam, you don't even know it
Your main bitch was a one nighter, you don't even know it
You went cuffed her, you went wifed her, cause yeen ain't even know it
That's fake titties and fake ass, but yeen ain't even know it
You runnin round like that bitch bad, cause yeen ain't even know it
This shit chea is called 20 Grand, yeen ain't even know it
I mean liquor, you thinking cash, cause yeen ain't even know it
This Audemar 'bout 80 thou, but yeen ain't even know it
I'm in the hood, but I got a big old house, I don't even go in
Way out of state and I barely stay, but yeen ain't even know it
They like Kidd you one hit away, I already know it
This rap game only getting worse, you don't even know it
Trinidad James song had one verse, yeen ain't even know it
On Forever track with Drake first, but yeen ain't even know it
Been tooken over a few hit songs, I learned you gotta keep going
I come straight from the bottom, tell me how you ain't know it
Everytime that I'm rhyming, I be telling my story
I jump for joy and they free my Pa, you ain't even know it
18 years behind bars, you ain't even know it
Consequences come when you hustle, you don't even know it
Your best friend's an undercover, but yeen ain't even know it
They in the life with the struggle, I'm the king of my jungle
Where niggas die right in front of you, trust who, I don't even know it
I got shot about 6 times, but you don't even know it
You could ask me how did I survive? I don't even know it
Must be fate cause I'm still here, no wheelchair but I'm rolling
Got nightmares of Kanye walking on stage stealing my moment
I'm blowin purp and I'm pourin purp and I'm poppin percs and I'm zonin
I'm Kidd Kidd from Mazant, downtown 9th Ward New Orleans, hah
Nigga, yeah
Yeah that nigga foolie and he know it
