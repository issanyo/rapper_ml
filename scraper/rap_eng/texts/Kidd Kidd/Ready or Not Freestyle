(Intro)
Boogie, wake up, nigga
Read that, head shots, T that gave me the head not
I know you dead now, I got a dead line
I’m duckin’ FED time, my home doin’ well
That mean he verifyin’, I don’t want every bitch
But I need every dime, u won’t get it, neva mind
It’s gon’ fuck you up the second time
I’m strapped at the second line, every time
It only take one second to die
A mignon, be very quiet, just start a riot
NBA jam, you on fire
I work hard and never tire
I roll hard in extra tires
I’m goin’ hard, need extra towels
We both god, need all of ours
Ain’t no IOUs, I dunno them vowels
I think I got the power, I watch too much Powel
One foot in and out of the game
Guess I’mma ball till I find (?) of the game
Till I dodge screen route the game
But fo’ now I’mma wait
I see the real from the fake
Find the snakes when I rake
Tryna build ’em a cave
Boogie, we feelin’ the hate
I’m tryna fill up a safe
Throw a milli in yo face
Eat yo shit off yo plate
Throw up a milli in yo face
I had my shot, no wait
I was supposed to be straight
Now I’m doin’ it big
Them musta been fake
I’m way ahead of you niggas
It’s a turtle race
Your hoe gotta Murda, Urkle face
If I want it I’m supposed to take
I ain’t supposed to wait
Rap shit takin’ too long?
I’m like fuck it, I’m gon’ score some weight
Man, with this still, no cape, banana clip
08, got yo bitch on tape like
Goddamn, bitch, how much dick you gon’ take?
We taped the whole thang, she did the whole gang
We all got in line and ran a soul train
Bitch, I’m the dope man
I’m dealing cocaine
I’m smoking propane
What’s loud in yo brain?
I luv Parmedazine, mixed with Codeine
Oops, I ain’t mean to hit yo bitch
I got low aim
I got no strains, I got no shame
I got no thing to do with no lame
Too much traffic, I’m in my own lane
Then I made way for my rider game
Haaa!
