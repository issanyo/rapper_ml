[Intro]
All fake niggas gettin' cancelled this year
Straight up
Ahh nigga! ha, ha

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
Gangstas move in silence, so I don't yap plenty
Opening up your mouth could get you slapped in it
I'm in them hallways with the cracks in it
My jaws got crack in it, calls crack ring it
Draws with gats in it, we hustle hard to get it
Can't stack, we spendin', bills stack to the ceiling
If I say it, I mean it, I rap after I did it
This ain't no rap gimmick nigga

[Hook: Kidd Kidd]
Let a real nigga eat
Let the fake niggas starve
All the weak shall perish
And may the strong go hard

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
Rappers said they 'bout that life, I really live it
Just know when you make your bed, you gotta lay in it
Hoping that it's king size, this 4 5 on my waist ain't my jean size
I'm havin' nightmares, from somebody I seen die
Tears in his eye, in a blink of an eye
Bang nigga you gotta go, I had to do it
I ain't a ho I had to prove it, who you, talkin all stupid?
Pull your gun out and ain't use it
Told you I'll be back, you had a chance to shoot me
Clip in my gun long enough to make a movie
Ba-rrrat nigga I'm back nigga, don't run
I let them bullets tear up your back nigga
Walk up on you then I'll put one in your hat nigga
Your body on the curb, phone the 5 like the brat nigga
Let your baby momma get the rest in peace tat nigga
No this ain't twitter, mention me I get at niggas
Miss me with the chat nigga
I run with the cat peelers[?], crack slippers
I ain't a rap nigga, I'm a Mayzac nigga

[Hook]
