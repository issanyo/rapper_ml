I say you left me cold hearted
You did some shit that left me so heartless
Aye
Aye Joe, I'ma speak the facts in this one

[Hook]
Diamonds shinin' on me right now as I'm speakin'
No new friends cause these fuck niggas be leachin'
Pastor Quando Rondo, on the track I be preachin'
Since I came up the fake love been increasin'
I had to realize, real eyes, they gon peep the real lies
I had recognize, you was fake but in real life
But in real life

[Verse 1]
I got to grind it's so hard to see ain't no days off
I gotta think extra smarter this shit gon pay off
I just wanna hit and run baby sorta like baseball
Michael Jordan, at the three I'm in the playoffs
Brand new draco it'll make yo fuckin face fold
You say you mental health but I don't see that in your case tho
Got a couple of shooters and movers I got 'em on a payroll
For a couple pounds I have you in the ground and then it's case closed
Red beam on the glizzy call it red nose reindeer
Doin' time in the cell I say I did a couple years
Every since Quaffie got killed I shed a couple tears
And since your girl with all that talkin' I can get a couple killed
Everybody around me fake, I can say a couple real
I got my mind on the prize I'm focused on a couple mill
Even with Cartier lens you couldn't even much see me
These niggas wanna be me, please don't end up on a T.V

[Hook]
Diamonds shinin' on me right now as I'm speakin'
No new friends cause these fuck niggas be leachin'
Pastor Quando Rondo, on the track I be preachin'
Since I came up the fake love been increasin'
I had to realize, real eyes, they gon peep the real lies
I had recognize, you was fake but in real life
But in real life

[Verse 2]
I gotta take care of my family, gotta make sure that my family eat
If you ain't on my family tree then you ain't even family
These niggas bitch made, they got these female tendencies
Sometimes I sit back and wonder why do they envy me
That shit ashamed how they hate me in my own city
Make one false move then I'ma hit him with that glizzy
All this money on me blue just like the rollin' 60's
Like forreal, forreal, no cap, no cap, no cap

[Chorus]
Aye
I say you left me cold hearted
You did some shit that left me so heartless
Aye
I say you left me cold hearted
You did some shit that left me so heartless
Aye
I'm just a youngin' from them projects
I'm just a youngin' from them projects
Aye, aye, ayee

[Hook]
Diamonds shinin' on me right now as I'm speakin'
No new friends cause these fuck niggas be leachin'
Pastor Quando Rondo, on the track I be preachin'
Since I came up the fake love been increasin'
I had to realize, real eyes, they gon peep the real lies
I had recognize, you was fake but in real life
But in real life

[Outro]
I gotta take care of my family, gotta make sure that my family eat
If you ain't on my family tree then you ain't even family
