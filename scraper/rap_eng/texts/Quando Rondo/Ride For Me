[Intro]
I ain't gon' lie, I'm in my feelings on this one
I don't be in my feelings this much, but

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me
Would you ride for me bae
Even though I'm in this place
And keep a smile on your face
Would you hold me down
Would you be my round
Keep your head above the ground
And promise you will never frown

[Verse 1]
Yeah, fuck a ho 'cause they play mind games
Quahfee got knocked off and I swear my whole mind changed
Right now I ain't in my right mindframe
These days true love hard to find mane
Like, would you hold it down in this jail house?
If I had a bond would you help a nigga bail out?
Or treat me like a pro shelf, baby gotta sell out
If I sent you letters baby would you check my mail out?
I say, I live a wicked life
Without you in my shit I live a vicious life
I'm sittin' in my cell like I miss my wife
I grip that .45 tight, I miss this life
She said Quando you institutionalized
See I ain't got no time for them institution lies
I look her in her face, I say baby would you ride?
Teardrops roll from her eyes
'Cause she my Bonnie, I'm her Clyde

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me
Would you ride for me bae
Even though I'm in this place
And keep a smile on your face
Would you hold me down
Would you be my round
Keep your head above the ground
And promise you will never frown

[Verse 2]
I feel like A Boogie, I still think about you
Butterflies in my stomach when I hang around you
Would you hold it down, while I'm locked behind this door
On social media with it, relationship goals, whoa
You talk 'bout me when you be posting, baby girl
I like the pictures you be posting
I got guns, and baby you got roses
So what that mean? we got guns and we got roses
Baby keep it ten times ten
Promise I'ma ride to the end, I'ma ride to the end
Shawty that's my lil lover
Love is long way from a friend, friend
She played with my feelings back then
She play now she gon' get this MAC-10, she gon' get this MAC-10
She played with my feelings back then, she play now she gon' get this MAC-10

[Chorus]
Would you ride for me
Would you ride for me bae
Even though I'm in this place
And keep a smile on your face
Would you hold me down
Would you be my round
Keep your head above the ground
And promise you will never frown

[Outro]
Would you ride, would you ride
Baby girl, I ain't got no time for them lies
A Boogie I still think about you
Butterflies in my stomach when I hang around you
Quando Rondo nigga
