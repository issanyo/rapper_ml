[From Snippet]

[Intro]
Tell 'em label me a real one
Tell 'em label me a real
Tell 'em label me a real one
Tell 'em label me a real one
Tell 'em label me a real one

[Verse 1]
[?] throwing all them shots like I didn't catch 'em
Put a condom on that dick around that Glock
That way I'm well protected
Youngin's thugging in my section
And they gone rock with that Calio for that Smith and Wesson
Durk told me treat the rap game like the dope game
They throwing so much dirt, they done covered up my whole name
This that straight drop, straight depart, pure cocaine
This that straight drop, straight depart, pure cocaine
What the world coming to?
Niggas telling on they partners, why the fuck they break the rules?
Convicted felon gripping on this chopper, I might make the news
I gave up every sin and fucking dollar, I done paid my dues
A-B-C-D, fuck it man, I'm playing past due for a W
I was shot down, I was [?] on M's
Can't fuck with ya'll
