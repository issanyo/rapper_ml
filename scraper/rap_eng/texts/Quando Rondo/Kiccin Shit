[Intro]
Ayy
QRN
Rich Homie Quando nigga
That right two, no that right three
I'ma fuck 'em up with this one

[Chorus]
I'm kickin' shit in Givenchy, these ain't no Foamposites
I know these niggas they envy but they ain't nobody
My whole team fly like a private jet, ain't no copilot
Say he don't know 'bout lil Quando, go ask your ho 'bout me
Feds askin' me 'bout a shootin' but I don't know bout it
I bought a house in Atlanta but still be in them projects
I poured a deuce in the Fanta, lean out the water faucet
I wrap my Glock 'round my bandana, I ain't with all that talkin'
I got some charges that's pending, assaults that's aggravated
First nigga blew in my city so they supposed to hate me
I done made over a hundred grand, I ain't graduated
I done did time in the can, came home, went back to the basics

[Verse]
You can't hang around me 'cause you capped up
You don't like me and I don't like you
This young nigga with me strapped up
If you move wrong he might shoot
Rich Homie Quando, that's right two
Drippin' sauce on 'em like Ragu
Say you gettin' money, I got a bag too
That's right two, nigga
Too official with that pistol, I'm gon' shoot that
Have some young niggas on your head just like a durag
And I'm so crip, I take a shower with a blue rag
And I can't walk up out my house without my blue flag
He ain't really who he claim to be, lame to me
Nigga really a game to me like Atari
This young nigga who came with me, he geeked up off that molly
I'm in Magic City with the racks out
If I threw a party it's packed out
Hit her from the back, pull her tracks out
Young rich nigga in the crack house
I was locked up but I'm back out
And I'm on these niggas' neck
I should get sponsored by Nike 'cause I'm all about a check
They know I'm up next
I figure that's why they hated on me
This for all the bitches who traded on me
This for my mama, she waited on me
That brand new Rollie, I'm waitin' on it
These diamonds 'round my neck, I swear I put that paper on it
This big Glock forty, I can't wait to put a laser on it
I might just go and buy a condo in Decatur homie

[Chorus]
I'm kickin' shit in Givenchy, these ain't no Foamposites
I know these niggas they envy but they ain't nobody
My whole team fly like a private jet, ain't no copilot
Say he don't know 'bout lil Quando, go ask your ho 'bout me
Feds askin' me 'bout a shootin' but I don't know bout it
I bought a house in Atlanta but still be in them projects
I poured a deuce in the Fanta, lean out the water faucet
I wrap my Glock 'round my bandana, I ain't with all that talkin'
I got some charges that's pending, assaults that's aggravated
First nigga blew in my city so they supposed to hate me
I done made over a hundred grand, I ain't graduated
I done did time in the can, came home, went back to the basics
