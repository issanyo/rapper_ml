[Hook]
Load up the glizzy with two extensions draw with the fifty
When I up it ain't no missing, shoot til it's empty
Yall must ain't heard my last song anybody can get it
I'm on my road to the riches I ain't stressin' these bitches
Reverse the clip and spend the Benz put this Glock to his fitted
And yall don't get no cool points for that accident killin'
I'm from this village with niggas really clutchin' extensions and that's on crip the beef ain't squashed til somebody get missin'

[Verse 2]
Jumped off the porch cause I was broke, I got them bands now
Light up a port, cock back my post and knock his mans down
And all that Instagram thuggin gone get you ran down
And we ain't playin round, choppers get to sprayin' rounds
And when it's up I swea it's stuck no ain't understandin'
I dropped a bag with my advance that I got from Atlantic
Jumped out sticks and Glocks with dicks and them niggas had panic
The way that Kay stutter you'll think it speakin' in Spanish
Shots to the brain if he think about touchin' my chain
Brand new draco sound rusty but when it shoot it spit flames
Glock twenty-three extended clip call it LeBron James
Heard of Lil Tim, he OTM, when he shoot he got aim

[Hook]
Load up the glizzy with two extensions draw with the fifty

Yall must ain't heard my last song anybody can get it
I'm on my road to the riches I ain't stressin' these bitches
Reverse the clip and spend the Benz put this Glock to his fitted
And yall don't get no cool points for that accident killin'
I'm from the village with niggas really clutchin' extensions and that's on crip the beef ain't squashed til somebody get missin'

[Verse 2]
They hated on that Life Before Fame, well this the life after
Hitlist got a book of names nigga don't make the next chapter
Since you actin' like it's smoke with us fuck it we handin' out cancer
He wish he never spoke on us catch him at church and murk the pastor
I'm having visions of killin' bodies bout to be missin
I'm dressin' up black dickies you know Lil Leeky with me
Feds say the shit is ridiculous Lil Quando Rondo sickening
Two hundreds holes in your car the news say we over did it
I drop a bag in the morning, tonight you on a stretcher
I'm ridin' round in a foreign grippin' on a shell catcher
My youngin do it off the love but I'ma still bless 'em and he bring back yo head shid I'ma give 'em extra
