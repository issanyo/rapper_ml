[Intro: Lil Ceno]
Hot Boyz shit nigga, all that shit nigga, yeah
Yeah, turn up

[Chorus: Lil Ceno]
I ain't never had shit so I'ma ball
Niggas switchin', got my back against the wall
I been hustlin', tryna stack the money tall
This exclusive, you don't know how much it cost
Niggas envy, you should hear the way they talk
I been grindin', tryna turn into a boss
Fuck the system, still screamin' fuck my dogs
Exclusive drip, fifteen hundred just to walk

[Verse 1: Lil Ceno]
Young nigga shit and these niggas they know
I say this shit from my heart and my soul
Straight out of the trap, all I know is the bowl
If I don't know you, serve you rock through the door
We gettin' the bird, gettin' this shit by the load
Play with that bread and get turned into toast
I'm sippin' on lean, hope I don't overdose
Yes I hit Pappadeaux, second toast
I be gettin' money, I'm lettin' you know
Free all my niggas stayed solid, didn't told
Free all my niggas locked up down the road
I took your bitch, put a lot in her throat
We goin' so hard, go the streets in a choke
I been stayin' on my grind, fuck these hoes
These niggas is pussy, we know it for sure
Yeah she know I keep it on me for sure
She on my drip and my dick and my flow
Where I come from, man I swear you can't go
Pull out them choppers and let the stick go
Goin' out bad, nigga be 'bout a ho
Play with that cash, we gon' see 'bout your folks
Me and my niggas got ties like a rope
Diamonds on me super wet likea boat
Remember them days, had the weed in my coat
I never sink, bitch you know I'ma float
Long live Jimmy, man that nigga the GOAT
I see through these niggas just like they scope
I keep the glizzy tucked in every show
Niggas be actin' like hoes, do the most
Where I come from, niggas dyin' 'bout the dough
I want some more and some more and some more

[Chorus: Lil Ceno]
I ain't never had shit so I'ma ball
Niggas switchin', got my back against the wall
I been hustlin', tryna stack the money tall
This exclusive, you don't know how much it cost
Niggas envy, you should hear the way they talk
I been grindin', tryna turn into a boss
Fuck the system, still screamin' fuck my dogs
Exclusive drip, fifteen hundred just to walk

[Verse 2: Quando Rondo]
Ayy, every day I wake up on my grind, gotta get it
Since a youngin, been chasin' money, fuck them bitches
I'm on my grind, can't let 'em knock me off my pivot
Feel like everybody 'round me really out to get me
They say they with me, I know they ain't really with me
Life on the run, seeoff the streets, they wanna trick me
Percocets hurtin' my stomach but I'm addicted
Been in these streets since a youngin so I'm committed
Through the check I'm steady thumbin', I gotta get it
State to state I'm on the road, and I keep runnin' through these bitches
Hi-Tech I'ma pour, for sippin' lean, I need no prescription
Hittin' licks and sellin' dope, I swear I grew up in them trenches
Just a couple months ago I was locked up behind them fences
Every night I'm in the studio, gotta get Lil Leeky out the trenches
It really hurt me to my heart when I seen Quafee on that television
I ain't have shit from the start but now they mad because a nigga winnin'

[Chorus: Lil Ceno]
I ain't never had shit so I'ma ball
Niggas switchin', got my back against the wall
I been hustlin', tryna stack the money tall
This exclusive, you don't know how much it cost
Niggas envy, you should hear the way they talk
I been grindin', tryna turn into a boss
Fuck the system, still screamin' fuck my dogs
Exclusive drip, fifteen hundred just to walk
