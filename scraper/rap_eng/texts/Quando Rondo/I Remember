[Intro: Quando Rondo]
I ain't gon' lie Pooh, you is a fool for this one right here nigga
Yeah, and my world Go Grizz nigga, yeah
Go Grizz nigga ayy, yeah

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Late nights on my avenue by myself, I ain't need a gang member (nigga I remember)
I ain't have no money on my books this time last year 'round September (nigga I remember)
12's jump behind me, I'ma do the dash real fast, no surrender (nigga I remember)
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
I remember hitting licks in the project housing
Yeah, Queezy hit a lick for few thousand
They be like there go that young nigga that stay wilding
I don't even much write, I be freestyling
I remember them days watching mama cry man
I remember that day that Lil Quahfee died man
Had to get off my ass, man I had to try man
I got to get a bag even if it's five bands
I remember hitting licks for them flatscreens
On hard streets, I been trying to serve them crack fiends
I remember them days I ain't have no clothes
I remember them days I was kicking doors
I remember mama saying I'm a bad child
I remember when I first went to the juvenile
I remember when I first realized the envy
Locked up in the cell, I couldn't get a penny

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Late nights on my avenue by myself, I ain't need a gang member (nigga I remember)
I ain't have no money on my books this time last year 'round September (nigga I remember)
12's jump behind me, I'ma do the dash real fast, no surrender (nigga I remember)
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I remember everything
Judge told my lawyer that I'm going to chain gang
OG's telling us that we can't hang
If I ever run into the opps we gon' bang
I remember everything
I was fuckin' with lil shawty, bought her everything
Stay one hundred to the grave, ain't gon' never change
Shout out to my mama, put her through so much pain
I remember all them shootouts that we had with them other niggas
My bitch got mad and fucked another nigga
Man that shit was crazy, ain't gon' lie it made me heartless
Fell in love with money, it's gon' stay with me regardless
I don't give a damn what they say, I'm the hardest
And I'm not never gon' leave my apartment
Different situation got me running with my mask on
Niggas still hating but I swear that it won't last long, oh no

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Late nights on my avenue by myself, I ain't need a gang member (nigga I remember)
I ain't have no money on my books this time last year 'round September (nigga I remember)
12's jump behind me, I'ma do the dash real fast, no surrender (nigga I remember)
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
Nigga I remember I remember, nigga I remember I remember
Nigga I remember
