[Intro]
I ain't gon' lie, I love you girl
But sometimes I feel like that
You really be on some other shit
And I gotta distance myself
I'm tryna run me up a check, you tryna run me crazy, hey
Tell me where'd I go wrong?
Tell me where'd I go wrong?

[Chorus]
Girl tell me where did I go wrong?
Times got hard, I just couldn't hold on
I been goin' through this for so long
Which one without you baby, life goes on
Girl tell me where did I go wrong?
Times got hard, I just couldn't hold on
I been goin' through this for so long
With or without you baby, life goes on, on

[Verse 1]
Tell 'em ain't no relationship, baby love do
Headaches and heartbreaks, that's what trust do
I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't love you
But at times I do be feelin' like fuck you
And you like fuck me, and then we break up
But that's some childish shit 'cause you know we gon' make up
Keep it one hundred with me, ain't no time for fake love
Keep it one hundred with me, ain't no time for fake love

[Chorus]
Girl tell me where did I go wrong?
Times got hard, I just couldn't hold on
I been goin' through this for so long
Which one without you baby, life goes on
Girl tell me where did I go wrong?
Times got hard, I just couldn't hold on
I been goin' through this for so long
Which one without you baby, life goes on, on

[Verse 2]
I told you I ain't fuck with her, you told me you ain't fuck with him
Reminisce about them days you said it was us, never them
I'ma be the bigger person, so I'm tired of walkin' out
Accusin' me of cheatin', shawty I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Keep it real with me, is your love still there?
Baby keep it real, do you love and care?
I don't know where we stand so I really need a chair
You got me stressin', pullin' out my hair

[Chorus]
Girl tell me where did I go wrong?
Times got hard, I just couldn't hold on
I been goin' through this for so long
Which one without you baby, life goes on
Girl tell me where did I go wrong?
Times got hard, I just couldn't hold on
I been goin' through this for so long
Which one without you baby, life goes on, on
