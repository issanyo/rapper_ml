[From Snippet]

[Chorus]
Why we can't be like them others, bae?

[Verse 2]
Why we can't go to a deserted island and go do some shit that you ain't never did?
Why we can't hop on a jet that is private and fly to some place that you never been?
Why we can't go spend a few couple thousand on brand new Chanels and Gucci kicks?
We can be out their way
Michael Jackson, go to Neverland
Drop a bag on your ass, I got hella bands
Couple shooters with me like the Taliban
We can [?]
Bae, we can be out the way
I'm only human so I wrote this letter to tell you nobody is perfect
I ask a question, you reply with a lie, and I know that you lyin' for certain
Every time we fuss and we fight, you gon' post on the 'Gram, and I'm like what's the purpose?
You told me secrets in life that I keep down inside to the point where that shit got me hurting
