[Intro]
Grrah, young nigga on some project shit
Young nigga on some project shit, ayy
Quando Rondo nigga

[Chorus]
Young nigga on some project shit, harder than a project brick
Pack of Newports and Actavis, yeah that's my starter kit
I put my Glizzy on my hip and flag to my left
I'd rather be judged by six than carried by twelve
Time in that cell made me realize, niggas don't show real love
I empty out that jet for what that make me fill that clip up
Ridin' 'behind my kinfolk, shout out Leeky, yeah it's crip love
I got a couple exes, I ain't gon' lie, I know I still love

[Verse 1]
On the paddy wagon, head down 'cause I was handcuffed
Multiple fights in juvenile, I had to get my hands up
Kicking in them doors, shit I had to get my bands up
If it's pressure with them niggas we gon' hit him in his mask up
Jumped up off the porch, money hungry, streets was starvin' me
First time slangin' iron was with Rufus, thuggin' on Orange Street
Fell in love with R&B, Purp said rap what you live
Justin hit me up on the road sayin' that Quahfee got killed, this shit real
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep
Keep me safely through the night, and wake me with the morning light
If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take
Before I walk up out this door, I gotta grab that thirty-eight

[Chorus]
Young nigga on some project shit, harder than a project brick
Pack of Newports and Actavis, yeah that's my starter kit
I put my Glizzy on my hip and flag to my left
I'd rather be judged by six than carried by twelve
Time in that cell made me realize, niggas don't show real love
I empty out that jet for what that make me fill that clip up
Ridin' 'behind my kinfolk, shout out Leeky, yeah it's crip love
I got a couple exes, I ain't gon' lie, I know I still love

[Verse 2]
Growin' up where I'm from, a dope dealer was my role model
Auntie smokin', grandmama addicted to the pill bottle
Got some niggas down the road think I forgot, but I still got 'em
Told such and such to chill with such and such but he still shot him
Rapper platinum in the industry, I'm goin' platinum in the streets
I'm not LeBron James, I promise I'll never leave the heat
A nigga will leave you six feet deep, stretched out on the block
Jaden came to visitation, they told me Ralfy got knocked, I was shocked

[Interlude]
Taking a closer look at the crime numbers in Savannah, get this: there have been thirty one homicides this year. But we're digging deeper, uncovering the number of unsolved murders in Savannah... Life in prison without the possibility of parole

[Chorus]
Young nigga on some project shit, harder than a project brick
Pack of Newports and Actavis, yeah that's my starter kit
I put my Glizzy on my hip and flag to my left
I'd rather be judged by six than carried by twelve
Time in that cell made me realize, niggas don't show real love
I empty out that jet for what that make me fill that clip up
Ridin' 'behind my kinfolk, shout out Leeky, yeah it's crip love
I got a couple exes, I ain't gon' lie, I know I still love
