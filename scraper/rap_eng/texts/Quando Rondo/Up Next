[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
I know some shooters come in silence to put you to rest
Don't hit my line 'cause I ain't got time if it ain't 'bout a check
Chains in the chain gang, callin' home like lil bro you up next
They prayin' on my downfall, but fuck 'em, I'm blessed
I put some shit inside my past that I still don't regret
And I got some shit that's on my mind that I still won't confess
I told that lil ho that she fine, I got her obsessed
Every day I grind just to turn that Honda to a Corvette

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
These lame ass niggas can't catch up
Want beef, I'ma put 'em in a stretcher
On the street we gon' creep when it's pressure
Guarantee that a nigga get wet up
One at night [?], I won't let up
Two fingers, one thumb, throw the set up, the set
About the gang niggas know I never stand down
Disrespect my name, swear to God he gettin' ran down
Live life broke, now the youngin got the bands now
She ain't wanna let me fuck, now that ho a fan now
Designer on me bitch, I'm fly just like jet
Sippin' lean, pourin' all this Hi-Tech
I bought a house but I still be in them projects
Gang, gang, gang gang gang, gang

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
I know some shooters come in silence to put you to rest
Don't hit my line 'cause I ain't got time if it ain't 'bout a check
Chains in the chain gang, callin' home like lil bro you up next
They prayin' on my downfall, but fuck 'em, I'm next
I did some shit inside my past that I still don't regret
And I got some shit that's on my mind that I still won't confess
I told that lil ho that she fine, I got her obsessed
Every day I grind just to turn that Honda to a Corvette

[Verse 2: TEC]
I'm blessed that I'm up next, ain't hate or get upset
I just waited my turn, I can't go back, no fuck that
These niggas so suspect, super friendly, can't trust that
That FN, I still clutch that
All in public, I can't help it, I'm still thuggin'
Even though I rap, I know you probably notice that
The shit these rappers go through, I won't go for that
You'll get forty holes for that
Shitted on my dreams when I was local, now how I'm 'posed to act?
Ain't ride but want a chauffeur back, you a whole ho for that
'Cause niggas ain't give me no handouts
So many excuses until they ran out
But I kept it movin' and I'm the man now
And the only way that they gon' see me is if they sittin' in them stands now

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
I know some shooters come in silence to put you to rest
Don't hit my line 'cause I ain't got time if it ain't 'bout a check
Chains in the chain gang, callin' home like lil bro you up next
They prayin' on my downfall, but fuck 'em, I'm blessed
I did some shit inside my past that I still don't regret
And I got some shit that's on my mind that I still won't confess
I told that lil ho that she fine, I got her obsessed
Every day I grind just to turn that Honda to a Corvette

[Outro: TEC]
Yeah, and that's on that nation man
Guwop Hussein bitch
I'm Farakhan to these streets nigga
I be really uh, preachin' that real knowledge, you know
Shout out to my nigga uh, Quando Rondo, you know what I'm sayin'
You know we gon' bless the streets with this bitch right here, you know
From Baton Rouge to Savannah Georgia
All the way retarded with us, gang
It's up now nigga, up next
Ain't no skippin' me, tippin' me, it's up
