[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Sauced up on the walk up, I be drippin' (drip)
Pockets filled with blue like I'm crippin' (crip)
Raw bands, Balmains, True Religion
In VIP, broke niggas keep your distance
Rich niggas to the other side, rich niggas to the other side
Broke niggas to the other side, broke niggas to the other side

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
It's a nigga in the club with my old bitch
You can have that bitch 'cause she be on some ho shit
Somebody in the club standin' by a fuck nigga
Point that nigga out and tell him you don't fuck with him
It's a bitch in the club fuckin' everybody
Fuck a bitch, can't fall in love 'cause they for everybody
Best believe I'm strapped up with that extension
So best believe it's enough bullets for everybody
Shake that ass in a circle baby, go go
Shake that ass in a circle baby, go go
Go up, down, round and round
Go up, down, up, down, round and round baby

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Yeah, I been booted up the worst way (turn up)
I remember having shootouts on my birthday
They tryna find out where Durk stay (no no no)
Don't know if they love me or tryna hurt me
Real shooters, pill poppers
Deal money, bought a lot of choppers
All the opposition, kill 'em motherfuckers
And I can't forget the trenches, them my blood brothers
Shout out Quando Rondo, he a lil boss
And they say I'm super savage, that's the hood fault
And I paid you to be cool, that's what love cost
Like shout out to the family, know I love y'all

Rich niggas to the other side, rich niggas to the other side
Broke niggas to the other side, broke niggas to the other side

If you from the West Side, nigga throw the West up
If you from the East Side, nigga throw the East up
Sauced up, I be drippin'
Pockets filled with blue like I'm crippin', yeah
