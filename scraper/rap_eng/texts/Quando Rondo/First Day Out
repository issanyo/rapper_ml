[Intro]
Lando you slaughtered this one
Quando Rondo nigga, ayy
Fuck wrong with y'all fuck niggas man?
Y'all know what's goin' on

[Chorus]
Murder on my mind, I'm on my grind all the time
And I can't go no where without it on my side, keep the nine
If a nigga want that beef, me I'm down to slang iron
Blue hundreds in my lil pocket, love to see dollar signs
To take a knife to my liver, man I'd die for my nigga
Behind the steering wheel, I'll ride for my nigga
You drop a tear, I drop a tear, I'll cry for my nigga
Bitch my hand up on the bible, I'll lie for my nigga
On my way the way to hell, asked the lord why for my nigga
I'm on probation but I'm still gon' get high with my nigga
'Cause you my nigga, nigga, ayy (ayy)
'Cause you my nigga, nigga, (hey)

[Verse]
On my way to Call Griffin, my head down
In the field with an extended clip, my lil nigga he goin' bed now
Everybody wearin' blue, pull up to blood, he red down
RIP to Mari and Quahfee, my niggas dead now
Keep a thirty-eight, swear to God that I won't play around
Just in case I catch a case and I'ma show up to your town
Can't even walk 'cause I stay down, chopper on me, I spray rounds
Swear to God Lil Quando Rondo keep the nine, won't play around
I had money on my mind, on my side I kept that nine
On my grind all the time, I got to get up
Fuck around with me, my niggas with it
I'ma show up to you, spray click clack
Bang bang, I'm aiming for your fitted bruh
Swear to God this shit always been my dream nigga
Forty Glock with the beam, nigga extended clips
Put that shit on Ca-rip
Kill or be killed the motto
Hoping I hit the lotto

[Chorus]
Murder on my mind, I'm on my grind all the time
And I can't go no where without it on my side, keep the nine
If a nigga want that beef, me I'm down to slang iron
Blue hundreds in my lil pocket, love to see dollar signs
To take a knife to my liver, man I'd die for my nigga
Behind the steering wheel, I'll ride for my nigga
You drop a tear, I drop a tear, I'll cry for my nigga
Bitch my hand up on the bible, I'll lie for my nigga
On my way the way to hell, asked the lord why for my nigga
I'm on probation but I'm still gon' get high with my nigga

[Outro]
They want to be me, but they ain't got the balls
Actin' like they don't see me, Jamie Foxx playin' Ray Charles
Actin' like they live the life but on the low these niggas false nigga, hey
Quando Rondo
(I ain't playin' no more games)
Hey, married to the streets, hah
(Coming soon nigga, first day out)
