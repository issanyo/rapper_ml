[Intro]
Can't leave the house without my gun
Can’t even trust a nigga can't leave the house without my guuun
Leave the house without my guuun
Now she won't pick up the phone
Im tripping can’t even walk
I did and he ain't talk

[Chorus]
I can't even trust a nigga can't leave the house without my gun
Said some shit to my woman now won't pick up the phone
Percocets in my system im tripping can't even walk
They told me pray to the lord I did and he ain't talk

I'm still here
(I’m still here)

I’m still here I guess it's good I’m still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I’m still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here


[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
See I done did so many thangs growing up in them trenches
And I done been put inside them chains and locked behind them fences
I done went plenty nights for food tell me do you know the feeling
Momma struggling drop out of school I had to go and get it
Serving junkies for pennies and quarters trying to stack it to the ceiling
Steady dreaming bout the suburbs from my window of that project building
Got on my knees prayed to the lord that one day I can touch a fucking million
Live by the gun die by the sword gotta keep a gun can't let nobody kill me
Going before my time up I still fear, be in a shootout but my gun jammed thank the lord I'm still here
Niggas be rapping bout that life but they don't live how we live
I feel like I'm on my 3rd strike no they don't feel how we feel
And if it come down to the come down I know they ain't gone keep it real
Living life on run trying to chase a dollar bill
In the city where I'm from I swear you gotta keep a steel
I swear false move that'll getcha ass killed for real , Yeah


[Chorus]
I can't even trust a nigga can't leave the house without my gun
Said some shit to my woman now won't pick up the phone
Percocets in my system im tripping can't even walk
They told me pray to the lord I did and he ain't talk

I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here


[Verse 2: Hester Shawty]
Talking like you bout it that ain't how you built lil nigga
Nigga tried to rob Me and he got hit with a missile
And I ain't trusting no nigga so I sleep with my pistol
Plenty times I done prayed and I ain't hear from the nigga


Back to back in my feelings this knotty head help with healing/
Depression entering my system it fuck with my senses
My momma made sure I was full but my pockets was empty
Started trapping my first thousand dollars felt like a million

I done cried bout Do'Shea so ion give a fuck bout a hoe
Fucked it up with Breanna so she can get what she want
I can't trip my sisters know they worried bout they brother
Dreamin bout that gated property in the hills for my mother

Bora bora with brothers I can't live normal
I just took another pill and it done transformed me
And My girl won't touch the phone guess she still ignoring
I'm still here a niggaI'm living guess I'm thankful for it


[Chorus]
I can't even trust a nigga can't leave the house without my gun
Said some shit to my woman now won't pick up the phone
Percocets in my system im tripping can't even walk
They told me pray to the lord I did and he ain't talk

I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here
(I'm still here)

I'm still here I guess it's good I'm still here
