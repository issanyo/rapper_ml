[Intro: Quando Rondo]
Yeah
Right too, no that's right three
I said right too, no that's right three
I said right too, no that's right three

[Chorus: Quando Rondo & Drako]
I kept it real from the start but you still think I'm wrong
I speak them facts in every verse, put my heart in my song
How the fuck you claim you love me? Look what you be postin'
You like a garden with caterpillars and dead roses
My heart so broken
For every nigga put me last, they gotta count me first
And I might need a new kidney from sippin' all this syrup
If I turn my back on my city, I swear to God it'll hurt
Lean in my system back to back, I'm still poppin' percs

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
So I grew up in the trenches, I had no choice but to get it
Every day stayed on a mission, I got no trust for these niggas
I got no love for these bitches, daddy was locked up in prison
True love, that's what I been missin', you can't feel this pain that I'm feelin'
But every day I be grindin', I'm tryna stack up a million
And when it come to promises and lies, I know 'bout a trillion
Mama couldn't pay the rent, got kicked out our project building
See you don't feel the pain I feel, don't live the life that we livin'
See I done sold a lot of dope, you can ask the fiends
Poured a lot of fours, poppin' percs and throwin' back them beans
Run around the block with that Glock with the magazine
Tryna make it to the top, tryna get in a magazine

[Chorus: Quando Rondo & Drako]
I kept it real from the start but you still think I'm wrong
I speak them facts in every verse, put my heart in my song
How the fuck you claim you love me? Look what you be postin'
You like a garden with caterpillars and dead roses
My heart so broken
For every nigga put me last, they gotta count me first
And I might need a new kidney from sippin' all this syrup
If I turn my back on my city, I swear to God it'll hurt
Lean in my system, back to back, I'm still poppin' percs

[Verse 2: Drako]
Ayy Quando I done shed tears for this shit and I did a bid for this shit
Know that decisions you pick, you gotta live with the shit
I take the good with the bad, no matter how hard it get
Some niggas fold under pressure but I was built for this shit
And they don't live how we live, they wasn't raised in the field
To hide the pain that I feel, I turned to codeine and pills
Hey mama stressin' 'bout them bills, I see it all in her face
I looked her dead in her eyes and told her we all gon' be okay
I gave my love and loyalty but I still got betrayed
Baby mama say she love me but she lie to my face
They say I'm all in my feelings, I'm just speaking on my pain
I gave it to all to that I got, I sacrificed for the game

[Chorus: Quando Rondo & Drako]
I kept it real from the start but you still think I'm wrong
I speak them facts in every verse, put my heart in my song
How the fuck you claim you love me? Look what you be postin'
You like a garden with caterpillars and dead roses
My heart so broken
For every nigga put me last, they gotta count me first
And I might need a new kidney from sippin' all this syrup
If I turn my back on my city, I swear to God it'll hurt
Lean in my system back to back, I'm still poppin' percs
