[Intro]
They just see how I'm livin'
They don't really know how I be feelin', nah
They just see how I'm livin'
They don't know how I be feelin'

[Chorus]
K-Swiss on my feet and I just wanted some Foamposites
Dreamin' 'bout them suburbs from the projects
Late night schemin', tryna make a profit
I know they gon' hate when that black card get in my wallet
K-Swiss on my feet and I just wanted some Foamposites
Dreamin' 'bout them suburbs from the projects
Late night schemin', tryna make a profit
I know they gon' hate when that black card get in my wallet

[Verse 1]
I gotta go hard on these instruments just to get these benjamins
Leeky next door to my cell, we was talkin' through a vent
He told me it's FNF, so it ain't no new friends
Once I make it to the top mama gon' get that new Benz
These niggas be bitch made, I guess that shit a new trend
Me and you are not the same so quit that comparison
He livin' a fairy tale, like them Odd Parents
Free my nigga NaNa, he was trappin' out the Heritage
I put money over bitches 'cause these gon' kiss and tell
Feelin' just like Lucci, all them haters they gon' wish me well
I'ma try my luck and throw a penny in the wishing well
Paper chasing, did my calculation on a digi' scale
Looked my auntie in her eyes, I told her I would never fail
Looked my brother in his eyes, I told him I would never tell
Free my niggas Juan and Icy, I know they forever real
Gotta stay solid, it's from the projects to that jail cell

[Chorus]
K-Swiss on my feet and I just wanted some Foamposites
Dreamin' 'bout them suburbs from the projects
Late night schemin', tryna make a profit
I know they gon' hate when that black card get in my wallet
K-Swiss on my feet and I just wanted some Foamposites
Dreamin' 'bout them suburbs from the projects
Late night schemin', tryna make a profit
I know they gon' hate when that black card get in my wallet

[Verse 2]
How the fuck you changed on me? you changed homie
You was in it for the fame homie, the fame only
I was locked up in them chains on me, you switched lanes on me
Now my body filled with pain on me
How the fuck you changed on me? you changed homie
You was in it for the fame homie, the fame only
I was locked up in them chains on me, you switched lanes on me
Now my body filled with pain on me
How the fuck you changed up?
Look what the fuck a nigga came from
I stuffed that dirty Curry in my bankroll
You told me if I keep it G that you gon' keep it gangster
Every day I'm strapped down, Walker Texas Ranger
These niggas fake, I thought that we was A-1
Smile in your face but they ain't really your day one
Hoodie on, head down, I'm feelin' just like Trayvon
Magazine that's in my clip, no Avon

[Outro]
I just want a mil in my face, hope I get a record deal off this tape
Changed on me, Quando Rondo nigga, yeah
