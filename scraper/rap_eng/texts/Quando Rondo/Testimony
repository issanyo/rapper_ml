[Intro: Quando Rondo]
It's just the life before fame
It's just the life before fame
Na na na, na na, na na, ayy, ayy
Quando Rondo nigga

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
My mama ask me how it feel to be in this position
To be honest mama, I swear that this just the beginning
Then she said baby don't you stop 'til you at the finish
Don't forget you came a long way from them trenches
Preach to 'em like a reverend, make them niggas listen
This my testimony, can I get a witness?
These niggas so phony, they ain't really with me
These bitches so phony, they ain't really with me, yeah

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
See I came from a city, a lot of blood, lot of sixties
A lot of AK's and glizzys, a lot of Pampers be shitty
I'm from where they don't show no pity, a lot of shooting and killin'
See off the drugs they be trippin', swear all my life I been crippin'
Niggas be killin' 'bout bitches and killers turnin' to snitches
Sho lost his life to the system, good niggas always fall victim
These niggas snakes filled with venom, plenty nights we ain't had dinner
Pistol tucked tight in my denims, Rabbit lost his life just last winter
You see like nowadays real and fake don't get seperated
Charges in another county pending, I'm still fighting cases
They say I changed up, once I came up I just elevated
I was full of pain bruh, I fuck around and fell in love with jadin'
If we ain't beefin' 'bout no money we ain't beefin', life is too short
We want all the smoke bitch, like a Newport
Just like a Newport, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
My mama ask me how it feel to be in this position
To be honest mama, I swear that this just the beginning
Then she said baby don't you stop 'til you at the finish
Don't forget you came a long way from them trenches
Preach to 'em like a reverend, make them niggas listen
This my testimony, can I get a witness?
These niggas so phony, they ain't really with me
These bitches so phony, they ain't really with me, yeah

[Verse 2: OMB Peezy]
Peezy, oh, no they ain't really with me
Keep my pistol inches from my hand, I know they out to get me
Robbin' niggas just to feed my family, now they out to kill me
Dirty world, especially where I roam, man this shit get filthy
Sorry it's hard to be friendly, my cousin got killed by his friend
I'm not a killer but don't push me, I hit your block in that van
Gave him an offer and he took it, now he tellin' on his best man
He was hard in the street shit, now he tellin' on the stand
People keep asking me how it feel to be in this position
I like the money but the fame could leave, shit I ain't trippin'
Five point seven fillin' up my FN, so I ain't slippin'
Try to take somethin', I'ma shake somethin' and leave your body drippin
My mama ask me how I feel, I say a lot done changed
Everything different but the pain, yeah that's gon' stay the same
Mama keep askin' me how I feel, I say a lot done changed
Everything different but the pain

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
My mama ask me how it feel to be in this position
To be honest mama, I swear that this just the beginning
Then she said baby don't you stop 'til you at the finish
Don't forget you came a long way from them trenches
Preach to 'em like a reverend, make them niggas listen
This my testimony, can I get a witness?
These niggas so phony, they ain't really with me
These bitches so phony, they ain't really with me, yeah

[Outro: Quando Rondo]
This my testimony, can I get a witness?
These bitches so phony, they ain't really with me, yeah
