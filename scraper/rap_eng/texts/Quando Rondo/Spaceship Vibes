[Chorus: NoCap]
I think about you all day and at night I watch the stars shoot
I know love is not a game but I can't control what my heart do
I fucked up so many times, I know you thinking I don't want you
I never tell you lies, I'm always giving you the hard truth
Remember we was way more than friends, I just wonder, "Would you love me again?"
I'm always having spaceship vibes, sometimes I think that I'm an alien

[Verse one: NoCap]
Wasn't no secrets that I liked, I think they see through (See through)
Girl, you know I hate for someone else to meet you (Meet you)
I don't know why that I act like I don't need you (Like I don't need you)
You gon' love this song, I just hope you like the beat too
Yo' heartbreak was crime, I know I'll prolly get sentenced life (Sentenced life)
I bought you Gucci but you told me that is not your size (Not yo size)
You looked at me, you gave it back, like this prolly for yo side hoes
You like, "I told you I wear a 5, so why you bought a size 4?"
Ion pay for pussy, cause I got common sense (Common)
I fucked her once and she been cummin' since (Cummin)
And then she leave, I bet she'll come again (She'll be commin)
I'ma fuck her good and make her cum again (Cum again)

[Chorus: NoCap & Quando Rondo]
I think about you all day and at night I watch the stars shoot
I know love is not a game, but I can't control what my heart do
I fucked up so many times, I know you thinking I don't want you
I never tell you lies, I'm always giving you the hard truth
Remember we was way more than friends, I just wonder, "Would you love me again?" (Love me again)
I'm always having spaceship vibes, sometimes I think that I'm an alien (Quando Rondo nigga)

[Verse two: Quando Rondo]
I'm making plays off a iPhone, lean in my Styrofoam
Walking down a long road, I ain' have a ride home
They ain' wanna fuck with me, nobody showed no love to me
Now everybody coming in my face, they see it's up with me
I remember way back when
I ain't have no money, that was way back then
Now I'm doing shows and picking up these back ends
Hi-tech, pour a four
The lean got me relaxing
I pray my youngins do what I taught em
OGs, they was selling dreams but Ian bought em
Now every diamond on me shine, they looking autumn
Dope boy dreams, I swear I came up from the bottom (From the bottom)
You left me scarred, I swear to god, Ion wanna hurt no more
Yo' loyalty and love, the only thing that I was feening for
I still think about you, day and night, and yeah it hurt my soul
I'm bout to pop this percocet and take a trip to Venus, though
I swear I'm bout to leave the globe

[Chorus: NoCap]
I think about you all day and at night I watch the stars shoot
I know love is not a game but I can't control what my heart do
I fucked up so many times, I know you thinking I don't want you
I never tell you lies, I'm always giving you the hard truth
Remember we was way more than friends, I just wonder, "Would you love me again?" (Would you love me)
I'm always having spaceship vibes, sometimes I think that I'm an alien
