[Intro]
Braat
Aye, Quando Rondo nigga
Dubba-AA Flex
Eh, eh, I say I'ma keep it real on this one nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
No they don’t love me like how they say the love me (Naw)
No they don’t love me like how the claim the love me (Naw)
No they don’t love me like how they say the love me (Naw)
No they don’t love me like how the claim the love me (Naw)

[Chorus]
Tear drops rollin' down my right eye
I bang my flag to my left
Fuck the fame behind my name I know lil' Pappy gon' step
Metro police askin' questions
Thinking we gon' confess
I did some shit inside my past that I still don’t regret
I’m on they neck aimin' for head so ain’t no sense to wear a Teflon
Brand new Gucci slides from Saks Fifth, you could get stepped on
Flowers get put on head stones
Quahfee my nigga dead and gone
Powder inside my nigga nose
Jayden think that I'm dead wrong

[Verse 1]
Befo' the cameras and the fame I use to kick doors
You claimin' you got 2 to catch up wit' us you need six more
Hangin' out the window with that choppa screamin' six souls
Six niggas in the rental down to slide, we clutchin' six poles
Before the cameras and the fame everynight I slept on buddha house
Steady prayin' my dreams come true so I could get the fuck out buddha house
I know my gun I can not move without
'Cause any minute we can shoot it out
Daddy wasn’t in my life
My momma smokin' dope by Rufus House
Wrote my first rap locked in that juvenile
All I needed was a chance
Nobody showed no love to me when all I needed was a hand
They took my nigga Quahfee from me
And all I needed was my mans
Down on my dick, started hittin' licks
'Cause all I needed was some bands

[Verse 2]
They claimin' loyalty is priceless
I feel I'm payin' for love
This for my niggas up in heaven
I shoot a flame up above
This for my niggas in them jail cells
I'ma bang for my thugs
This for them pussy muthafuckers steady showin' fake love
I'm in the valley of death, conversatin' wit' the under gods
Screamin' out Never Broke Again while clutchin' my rod
I know them pussy niggas hatin' 'cause I bet all the odds
I had to separate the real from fake, the pros and the cons
This for them streets (Yeah them real niggas)
This for them G’s (And them Crips niggas)
This for them Jects (Them HVill niggas)
And for the check (They gon' deal witcha)
That’s a bet (We empty clips nigga)
I swear to god that this the life a nigga live nigga
Ay, Shots fired off from the Beretta
I got a house in Marietta
See I ain’t 'bout to do no talkin'
See I don’t wanna hear no lecture
I’m yellin' out we 'bout whatever
You may as well take your last breath
Shots fired off, he on the stretcher(Raa)

[Break]
Ay, check this out tho'
I made this song specifically for a fuck ass nigga, my nigga
I just want that pussy ass nigga to know this NH business my nigga
And guess what tho' I'ma buy your son a present too bitch ass nigga

[Chorus]
Tear drops rollin' down my right eye
I bang my flag to my left
Fuck the fame behind my name I know lil' Pappy gon' step
Metro police askin' questions
Thinking we gon' confess
I did some shit inside my past that I still don’t regret
I’m on they neck aimin' for head so ain’t no sense to wear a Teflon
Brand new Gucci slides from Saks Fifth, you could get stepped on
Flowers get put on head stones
Quahfee my nigga dead and gone
Powder inside my nigga nose
Jayden think that I'm dead wrong

[Outro]
How the fuck you gon' beef and you broke nigga?
This is the sound
Answer that
Shouldn’t have spared that pussy ass nigga mama in the store that day
