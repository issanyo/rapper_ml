[Intro]
CashMoneyAP
I go to war 'bout my niggas, yeah
Quan just made a hit
Quando Rondo nigga, yeah
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Chorus]
OG told me Quando life's a gamble like a pair of dice
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga up in paradise
Tryna forget the pain, put a xanny in my dirty Sprite
They choose the life of fame, I'm feeling already lived that life
Baby don't you change, you know one day you gon' be my wife
Walk in Lenox Mall, we gon' leave out with a lot of ice
I go to war for you, baby girl I put up a fight
I ride for lil shawty and I told her that that's wrong or right

[Verse 1]
I know they hatin' 'cause a nigga came up
Nicky really my round, I know he won't change up
Every day strapped down, Quinsey kept a banger
Now my nigga locked down, got me filled with anger
Life on the run, I can't let 'em capture me
To the top with my niggas, I swear that's where I'd rather be
Every day strapped down 'cause these niggas after me
Jacksonville to Miami, they can't keep no track of me
I know, a blue flag on my left, 'cause bitch I'm rollin' sixties
Been flippin' with Lil Quisey, hittin' licks city to city
I know they want me dead so I got thirty in my glizzy
If you lookin' for me, I ain't hidin', nigga come and get to the
Top where I'm going, I know they hating 'cause I'm elevating
Patiently, yeah I been waiting
Every day I'm paper chasing
Feeling it's my time though, hustled and then I grind for it
I done committed crimes for it, many times I did time for it

[Chorus]
OG told me Quando life's a gamble like a pair of dice
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga up in paradise
Tryna forget the pain, put a xanny in my dirty Sprite
They choose the life of fame, I'm feeling already lived that life
Baby don't you change, you know one day you gon' be my wife
Walk in Lenox Mall, we gon' leave out with a lot of ice
I go to war for you, baby girl I put up a fight
I ride for lil shawty and I told her that that's one gon' ride

[Verse 2]
Promise we gon' ball at the three point line
Rajon Rondo baby, you can be my number nine
Just keep that shit one hundred just like ten dimes
Just keep that shit one hundred like ten dimes
Got you baby girl, you know I'ma put up shots
I'ma buy you that new Mercedes fresh out the lot
I got these niggas hatin' 'cause they seeing what I bought
I caught a couple cases but you know my shits got fought
Tryna run me up a check, she tryna run me crazy
'Til the very end, would you be my lady?
'Til the very end, would you be my baby?
Poppin' Percocets to ease away the pain lately
4 Pockets Full, shout out Lil Baby
You know my clip full, pull out that three eighty
I do this for Bowen Flats, they really raised me
Tryna duck the feds 'cause they tryna trace me

[Chorus]
OG told me Quando life's a gamble like a pair of dice
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga up in paradise
Tryna forget the pain, put a xanny in my dirty Sprite
They choose the life of fame, I'm feeling already lived that life
Baby don't you change, you know one day you gon' be my wife
Walk in Lenox Mall, we gon' leave out with a lot of ice
I go to war for you, baby girl I put up a fight
I ride for lil shawty and I told her that that's one gon' ride
