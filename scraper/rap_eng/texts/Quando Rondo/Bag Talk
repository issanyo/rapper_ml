{Intro}
VVses they shinin' , water shit real diamonds
’'You watchin a VichMont Film'’
Yeah yeah

{88Mo - Hook}
Drippin [?] that bag talk,I keep them hittas around me
You know how they come in the projects,moonrock got me surfin'
Real drip that flavor,ocean water my diamonds,vvses they shinin'
Double gs to my belt
I done bossed up on em,real drip that flavor,all of my diamonds they ocean,I'm high as a pilot on floatin'
I take yo lil' bitch to mistreat her,I'm a dog I go deep in that pussy
Pour me a four and get fainted (oh yeah yeah)
Louis V on my color,I done bossed up on em,real drip Sevilla,all of my diamonds they ocean
Got em drippin' water,my water on sippin’,I take yo bitch and mistreat her,I’m a dog I go deep in that pussy

{88Mo - Verse}
I send them hittas to handle you,I put them racks to yo head
My nigga come straight out the jungle,connected with killers and drug dealers
I don't got no feelings I’m [nonchalant?] , I'm up planning get me a check
Came up now I'm ballin,I ain't no cappin’ that's facts
I get it poppin for real,I got a plug out in Cali
My niggas send [?],I get them racks on the low
You know I just made me a play,finessin [?]
88 we up next,young nigga I'm flexin'

{88Mo - Hook}
Drippin [?] that bag talk,I keep them hittas around me
You know how they come in the projects,moonrock got me surfin'
Real drip that flavor,ocean water my diamonds,vvses they shinin'
Double gs to my belt
I done bossed up on em,real drip that flavor,all of my diamonds they ocean,I'm high as a pilot on floatin'
I take yo lil' bitch to mistreat her,I'm a dog I go deep in that pussy
Pour me a four and get fainted

{Quando Rondo - Verse}
I know these niggas they fakin' they envy so I gotta keep me a choppa
I just bought my bitch some brand new Balencis and she just bought me a revolver
If you want it girl Imma spend it,brand lew Louis V shop Atlantic
Run in Corvette this ain't rented,when I'm comin' through windows tinted
Don't call my phone if it ain't about paper,ballin real hard should of played for the lakers
Walk in the room with the bands on the table
See I dropped out the porch cause we didn't have cables
Sippin' on syrup,I ain't talkin' bout Maple (aye,aye)
[?] chills add a lil flavor (aye)
I got some niggas who trappin' in the trenches and move when I say so
I got a bitch who put guns in the nation,just bought me a Draco
I got a freak hoe stay in Atlanta [?] (x2)

{88Mo - Hook}
Drippin [?] that bag talk,I keep them hittas around me
You know how they come in the projects,moonrock got me surfin'
Real drip that flavor,ocean water my diamonds,vvses they shinin'
Double gs to my belt
I done bossed up on em,real drip that flavor,all of my diamonds they ocean,I'm high as a pilot on floatin'
I take yo lil' bitch to mistreat her,I'm a dog I go deep in that pussy
Pour me a four and get fainted
