[Intro]
QRN
Quando Rondo nigga, ayy

[Chorus]
Back to the basics nigga, back to the basics
Back to the basics nigga, back to the basics
Back to the basics nigga, back to the basics
Back to the basics nigga, aye

[Verse 1]
2012, I was twelve in a cell rappin' off of instrumentals, then Louie told me Quando boy you a fool wit' it
2013 got a .38 revolver, tuck that in my pants, swear I use to go to school with it
This a real life story so I gotta keep it real
Stack-stack that money for a lawyer I been told that since a lil' nigga
I be totin' on a Tommy I ain't talkin' 'bout no Hilfiger
If it ain't about blue hunnits nigga I don't wanna deal with you

[Bridge]
Straight off the head but they gon' think that I wrote this
Couldn't afford no bed, on the floor with all the roaches
Shawty got good head, pussy wet just like the ocean
Adderall and the percys the only thing that keep me focused

[Verse 2]
Doubled up with sticks, pistol, I'ma explode it
Double cup with drank got me movin' in slow motion
I let that hoe meet mother so now she thinkin' she a Bowman
I'ma fuck with no rubber see I don't really need no Trojan
I was sittin' in a cell when I made that "I Remember"
Now I'm fuckin' all these bitches and they name I don't remember
I was down bad on my dick just last September
Now every diamond on me hittin' cold like last winter
Couple months ago see I was sleepin' in a basement
Now I'm rockin' all these shows turnin' up on all these stages
I had to tell me momma no, I gotta stack it up and save it
Real street nigga swear I came up from the pavement
I went to jail for a gun came home went back to the basics
I just hit a homerun and I done touched all four bases
I know they hate I came up I see the look on all they faces
My last bitch changed up I left her in a free agent
Too many missed calls, why the fuck they keep on callin' me?
Shawty on the block list why the fuck she keep on stalkin' me?
Came up from the projects to the top, that's where I ought to be
Grippin' on this FN, in case a nigga wanna start me
Six plus six, twelve shots, I got two revolvers
More money, more problems, they be feelin' on the problem solvers
Shop in Neiman Marcus, 15 hunnid for my sneakers
Shirt made by Versace and the print came off a cheetah
Went to school and got suspended, never listen to my teachers
Now my life full of grinnin', turn them haters to believers
Shawty so one-hunnit, swear to God she keep it G tho
But if I gotta beat you then baby I don't need you
Couple months ago see I was locked behind the cell tho
Took a trip to Cali just to spend a bag on Melrose
Whole team be ballin', I ain't talkin 'bout no Derrick Rose
Deep off in that water I might just went down a well talkin'
Labels keep on callin' talkin' about signing I'm like hell no
Since like twelve I been on probation
I might go back to jail for the chances I'm takin'
I might need a cemetery for all of these dead faces

[Chorus]
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics

[Bridge]
Straight off the head but they gon' think that I wrote this
Couldn't afford no bed on the floor with all the roaches
Shawty got good head, pussy wet just like the ocean
Adderall and the percys the only thing that keep me focused
