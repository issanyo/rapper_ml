[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I know times get hard, I gotta keep it on
Hope I make it far, I know times get hard

[Verse 1: Yhung T.O.]
My momma told me gotta keep that pole on me
'Case a nigga try to up that score on me
I just hope my down bitch never fold on me
It been feelin' like the devil got a hold on me
Always see you talk a lot, but you ain't really 'bout it
VVS's on my neck, I be really countin'
Always say how they gon' slide, but I really doubt it
I been cryin' for so long, I'm so sick and tired
'Cause baby I don't wanna hurt no more
Lately I been gone on tour
But when I'm back home it's still the same shit
Posted on that block, late night tryna flame shit
And you claimin' that you real, but I'm knowin' that you ain't
Knowin' that you ain't, I just hope my problems fade
Hope they fly away, I just hope the Lord let me see another day
And the Lord I pray

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I know times get hard, I gotta keep it on
Hope I make it far, I know times get hard
I know times get hard, I gotta keep it on
Hope I make it far, I know times get hard

[Verse 2: Quando Rondo]
I been feelin' so betrayed since I came on
Niggas say they keep that shit 1,000 they gon' change though
And I can't go nowhere without it, gotta keep that 4-5
I'm feelin', just let me G I'm a young fly fly
They just wanna ride my wave, for the cameras and the fame
But I'm like, "Where the fuck was you when I was locked up in them chains?"
When I was walkin' through the rain
All these rappers be cappin' it's real stories not all watches and chains
I'm poppin' Percocets and pourin' up drank
I'm tryna ease all the pain
I'm in the Wraith on the interstate steady switchin' these lanes
My youngin' totin' the 30 'K and he throwin' up gang
I'm ridin' round wit' a .38, when I shoot it spit flames
Would you rock and roll wit' me? No Elvis Presley
I gotta keep that pole wit' me that's a brand new XD
Deep in these skreets so my girl feelin' like that I won't make it far
But listen baby

[Chorus: Yhung T.O.]
I know times get hard, I gotta keep it on
Hope I make it far, I know times get hard
I know times get hard, I gotta keep it on
Hope I make it far, I know times get hard

[Outro: Al Green]
Everything is gonna be alright
He's comin' back, like he said he would
Everything is gonna be alright
He's comin' back, like he said he would
