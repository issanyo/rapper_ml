[Intro: Shon Thang]
Shon Thang
Whole lot of gang shit goin' on
You dig, alright

[Verse 1: Shon Thang]
I gotta make it happen for me, yeah, yeah
I done came a long way, yeah
And none of this ain't happen in a day, yeah
We up next any day, yeah
I got a family to feed
But trust in the gang, yeah the shit there I bleed
You know it's all gas, no brakes, y'all on E
It's up when it's beef, spin a bin with the doors off the jeep
Drive skinny P, I know what hurt feel like
Without a fig help me feel right
Still livin' rap dreams, what a deal like
Baby girl told me Shon keep it still at night
You know them fuck boys from the other hood mean no good
They'd take a nigga soul if they could
That's why I walk 'round with my head up, less but it's tucked
Know I'm clutchin' on that wish a nigga would
A whole lot of gang shit goin' on
Don't get top before the show, we ain't goin' on
If you know your nigga lame and he ain't got change
My love, why the fuck you still holdin' on?
You gon' miss out on your best one when dealin' with me
Pour your heart out, girl leave your feelings with me
Wanna hustle up an appetite, juggin', I be starvin'
I labor like shawty come have a seat

[Chorus: Shon Thang]
And she like the freaky things we do
She say I got them hoes, I'll change for you
You know I made it happen but she gotta know hoes come with rappin'
And I'm on the way up, the delay is the traffic
Beep beep, stay in your lane on Jeep Street
This shit was destined for me
So I gotta make it happen whether the rappin' or it's trappin'
On gang, bitch we all gotta eat
And she like the freaky things we do
She say I got them hoes, I'll change for you
You know I made it happen but she gotta know hoes come with rappin'
And I'm on the way up, the delay is the traffic
Beep beep, stay in your lane on Jeep Street
This shit was destined for me
So I gotta make it happen whether the rappin' or it's trappin'
On gang, bitch we all gotta eat

[Verse 2: Quando Rondo]
I say we all gotta eat, every day I grind no sleep
Four weeks in the trap, tryna make a couple hundred
See I jumped up off the porch 'cause I ain't really had nothin'
Now when you see me, bitch I'm flexin', every day the youngin stuntin'
Keep it one hundred, I keep it a thousand
She say be saved in the project housin'
Heard them niggas sendin' shots from the other side
What they talkin' 'bout nigga, we'll bring the choppers out, yeah
I done been through this shit, so many times
Hustlin' inside the rain for pennies and dimes
Fast forward my lifestyle, please don't press rewind
We just wild while I'm in that cell doin' time
If you ain't got it like, you ain't gotta fake it
So many times that I been hurt, I been be-traited
She afraid she gon' lose me to the streets
Or to the heat, or to the jail from the chances that I'm taken
I know I'm the hottest youngin in the making
Coming through like Freddy Krueger, masked up like Jason
OG told me stay down and be patient
Got off my ass and got a bag, got tired of waiting
She hit my line all the time like why you gone?
She like you on my mind when you not home
I'm in the trap catchin' plays off my phone
Swing his block with that K, one to the dome

[Chorus: Shon Thang]
And she like the freaky things we do
She say I got them hoes, I'll change for you
You know I made it happen but she gotta know hoes come with rappin'
And I'm on the way up, the delay is the traffic
Beep beep, stay in your lane on Jeep Street
This shit was destined for me
So I gotta make it happen whether the rappin' or it's trappin'
On gang, bitch we all gotta eat
And she like the freaky things we do
She say I got them hoes, I'll change for you
You know I made it happen but she gotta know hoes come with rappin'
And I'm on the way up, the delay is the traffic
Beep beep, stay in your lane on Jeep Street
This shit was destined for me
So I gotta make it happen whether the rappin' or it's trappin'
On gang, bitch we all gotta eat
