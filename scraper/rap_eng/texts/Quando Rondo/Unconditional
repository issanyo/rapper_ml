[Intro: Quando Rondo]
Pooh, you a fool for this one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ay
Ooo, Quando Rondo nigga
Winners circle

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Unconditional fake love, that's what they showed me (Showed me)
I been grindin’, perfect timin' on my Rollie (Rollie)
EA Sports, I'm in the game ballin’ like Kobe (Kobe)
In the trenches rockin' out wit' my lil' woadie
My girl rock her like a rockstar wit' no guitar
I've been fuckin' on these bad, bad broads, all these pop stars
Cruisin' on an interstate in a fast car
Bring the real cat scat, practice, not a NASCAR
NASCAR

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
Same fit for a whole, yeah we were paper chasin’
Rubber bands inside my shoebox
Ain’t no nothin' ’bout no safe ('Bout no safe)
Spend that shit and get it back again that fixture's in rotation (In rotation)
I know these niggas hatin' but fuck it ’cause that just motivation
She hit it from the back, my jack got beated on her
Caught the pussy, gave that hoe some cash and then I skeeted on her
I cut my partner off, no scissors, realized I ain't needed homie
I put my trust in that lil' bitty but she fuck around and cheated on me
Constant conversations with me ex, she wanna be together
I came up from the bottom so my motto "yeah, we Rich Forever"
Free my nigga Queasy, I remember we hit licks together
Beefin' wit' the Opps, we swang that block
We take the sticks together, yeah

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Unconditional fake love, that's what they showed me (Showed me)
I been grindin', perfect timin' on my Rollie (Rollie)
EA Sports, I'm in the game ballin' like Kobe (Kobe)
In the trenches rockin' out wit' my lil' woadie
My girl rock her like a rockstar wit' no guitar
I've been fuckin' on these bad, bad broads, all these pop stars
Cruisin' on an interstate in a fast car
Bring the real cat scat, practice, not a NASCAR
NASCAR

[Verse 2: Lancito]
Pull up in a fast car wit' the doors goin' suicide
Money over bitches, that forever be my alibi
Had to leave my bitch 'cause she was fucking with the other side
Catch her wit' a nigga, choppa singin' like a lullaby
My new bitch, she be curvin' but I think I love the chase tho'
Nike shoebox, got me screamin' fuck a safe tho'
Stars in the ceilin', this that outta space flow
They wanna let me fuck but let me hit in a Wraith tho'
My momma, she be trippin' all night, I be schemin'
Balmain's is on my body, it protects me from my demons
Half a mil' on Worldstar, think I must be dreamin'
That's my baby girl, she the Kel to my Kenan
And these niggas wanna beat me, they need me
And they know soon they gon' see me, on TV
I be fuckin' all these pop stars like RiRi
Swear this shit is not a game now, believe me

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Unconditional fake love, that's what they showed me (Showed me)
I been grindin', perfect timin' on my Rollie (Rollie)
EA Sports, I'm in the game ballin' like Kobe (Kobe)
In the trenches rockin' out wit' my lil' woadie
My girl rock her like a rockstar wit' no guitar
I've been [?] on these bad, bad broads, all these pop stars
Cruisin' on an interstate in a fast car
Bring the real cat scat, practice, not a NASCAR
NASCAR
