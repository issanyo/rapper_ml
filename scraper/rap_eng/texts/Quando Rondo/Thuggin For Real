[Intro: Quando Rondo]
Uh-uh-uh (ra, ra, ra)
Uh-uh-uh (ooo-wee, ra)
Aye, turn my mic up, gang
I don't know what they on
But bitch we thuggin' for real
Fore' I walk up out my home I swear I'm clutchin' my steel
I swear I'm tuckin' my steel, gang
Quando Rondo nigga (aye yeah)

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Feds kicked my grandma door in talkin' 'bout a shooting
Trending topic of my city
Gotta watch how I'm movin'
I know these niggas out to get me
I don't trust nobody
Leeky strapped up with that glizzy down to catch a body
Ridin' around, I'm ridin'
And I'm slidin' on any fuck nigga claimin' they want it
When there's beef we on your street
I'm not gone drop the bag on it
Its consequences when you fuck with me and any of my homies
When it come to that fuck shit swear to God that we on it

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
Can't say that I'm caught up in the fame
'Cause bitch I stay in the streets
Catch him slippin' and bust his brains
You know I stay with that heat
He best not mention my name
Or we gon' put him asleep
Niggas say what 'bout that gang
Bitch know that all us gone creep
No face, no case they don't know who the shooter
All white .38 and I got it from boo
I'll up the murder rate, nigga play I'ma do 'em
So I got the license plate so now I gotta lose 'em
Popping these percys, I swear I abuse them
Thuggin' in public we uppin' on Truman
That nigga had ran, it was him and manz
We flippin' this city and callin' my shooters
These niggas be bluffin', ain't really no killa's
Got a drum on the Glock call that bitch Reggie Miller
The shit that they talkin, I swear I don't feel it
Push it up, bitch it's stuck, I swear I don't miss
When it's up, bitch it's stuck, I swear I'ma kill 'em, ohh
When it's up, bitch it's stuck, I swear I'ma kill 'em, gang
Wake every morning, brush my teeth and throw my flag to my left
Drop to my knees and say a prayer
Lord I'm askin' for help
I grab my hecktor out the dresser
Then I walk by myself
I wonder who gone walk with my through the valley of death

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Feds kicked my grandma door in talkin' 'bout a shooting
Trending topic of my city
Gotta watch how I'm movin'
I know these niggas out to get me
I don't trust nobody
Leeky strapped up with that glizzy down to catch a body
Ridin' around, I'm ridin'
And I'm slidin' on any fuck nigga claimin' they want it
When there's beef we on your street
I'm not gone drop the bag on it
Its consequences when you fuck with me and any of my homies
When it come to that fuck shit swear to God that we on it

[Verse 2: JayDaYoungan]
We on it
And we coming
Point at your head like who want it?
In these streets this shit get real
So I'm prepared for the moment
All that fuck shit get you killed
I can't fuck with you phonies
Every day I'm in the field, I'ma go off just like Tony
And I ain't had to ask for shit, I ran it up by my lonely
The Glocks they come with thirty sticks, for me to split my opponent
Spin on that block, let off some shots
Was tryna take off your stomach
And all my niggas clear the business, bust yo shit if I want it
Got me a bag, had to get me a check
Thankin' the Lord everyday how I'm blessed
Fuck niggas mad I'ma stand in their chest
He cross the line, I'ma take off his neck
Check out my diamonds, I flooded my neck
Shoutout to my city they know who the best
Fuck all the haters, bitch get off my dick
Never gon' fold, I was built for this shit
T-shirts and picture frames, I'm tryna put your face on it
I grabbed a .38, a dirty K now I'm like who want it?
If you want cancer I got answers, bitch we right on your corner
It's on sight gone take your life walk down and put this bitch on you

[Chorus: Quando Rondo]
Feds kicked my grandma door in talkin' 'bout a shooting

Ridin' around, I'm ridin'
And I'm slidin' on any fuck nigga claimin' they want it
When there's beef we on your street
I'm not gone drop the bag on it
