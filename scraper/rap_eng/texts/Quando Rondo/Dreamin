[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
You know it's hot in hell's kitchen nigga
Q-R-N, and I was jack boy dreamin', hey
Quando Rondo nigga, hah

[Chorus]
Chlorine 'cause that pussy need some Kleenex
Jack boy lifestyle, day and night I was schemin'
Dope boy scrape it out the pot, them fiends was fiendin'
Had to wake up to reality, for so long I was dreamin'
I was jack boy dreamin', I was codeine dreamin', yeah
I was jack boy dreamin', I was codeine dreamin', yeah

[Verse 1]
I was jack boy dreamin', had to wake up to reality
Life on the run, the feds in town and they was after me
I was young and thuggin', I didn't really know the outcome
Smokin' weed every day and poppin' X, no Malcolm
Jack boy dreamin', every day yeah I was paper chasin'
Killin' niggas' dreams like Martin Luther's assassination
Nigga, I know you the real you, right now and you impersonatin'
Boy I kill you, and middle finger to the person who be hatin'
Know a couple niggas on go for me
They'll shoot for free, don't need no money
You be cappin' nigga, you so funny
You ain't trappin' nigga, that's show money
They say I'm flexin' with Bo money
Double cup, I'm leanin'
Sip so much of codeine I can see it when I'm peein'

[Chorus]
Chlorine 'cause that pussy need some Kleenix
Jack boy lifestyle, day and night I was schemin'
Dope boy scrape it out the pot, them fiends was fiendin'
Had to wake up to reality, for so long I was dreamin'
I was jack boy dreamin', I was codeine dreamin', yeah
I was jack boy dreamin', I was codeine dreamin', yeah

[Verse 2]
I was jack boy dreamin', I was codeine dreamin', yeah
They say I sound like Rich Homie Quan, nah, this is the way I flow
Shout out Rich Homie Quan, fuck with me and gon' hurt 'em more
Age eighteen and I done caught so many felonies
Dropped up out of school 'cause I could never pass a spelling bee
Stay ten toes down, that's what all them OG's telling me
I do this for them niggas who was locked up in that cell with me
I need him dead 'cause he mentioned me
Boy you scared, why you dissing me?
I know my ex bitch, she missing me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It's a cold cold world so you better keep that heater nigga
It's hot in hell's kitchen, and I know that you'll freeze up nigga

[Chorus]
Chlorine 'cause that pussy need some Kleenix
Jack boy lifestyle, day and night I was schemin'
Dope boy scrape it out the pot, them fiends was fiendin'
Had to wake up to reality, for so long I was dreamin'
I was jack boy dreamin', I was codeine dreamin', yeah
I was jack boy dreamin', I was codeine dreamin', yeah
