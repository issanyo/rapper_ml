[Verse 1]
Whole lotta money on me right now, it ain't no cappin'
We geeked in the backseat with the 45, one false move and he blastin'
He sayin', "Neighborhood, what's crackin'?"
I need like 10 purple pounds, bitch we taxin'
How lil Quando came up, they keep on askin'
From the trenches to being famous, that's what's happenin'
Haters tryna fuck my name up, I'm laughin'
I know I'm bout to fuck the game up, it's closed casket

[Hook]
I told them folks I need like 10, 10, 10
For a show I need like 10, 10, 10
For that bag of dope I need like 10, 10, 10
On my lil hoe I spent like 10, 10, 10

[Verse 2]
I'm in Beverly Hills with a bad bitch
I know they angry at me cause I'm mad rich
A year ago I was average, got 21 no savage
Anything she want, she can have it
And that pistol on me, I ain't lacking
These niggas so fake, they be cappin when they rappin
Two bad bitches, house in Decatur
I go to Ruth Chris' just to fuck the waiter
[?]
Gotta go hard, ain't nobody greater
In the five-star, in the elevator
In Los Angeles ballin like the Lakers
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hello?
Hey Quan, [?]
Hell naw, nigga
Run it by me [?]
For a verse or for a show, I told you niggas I need 10

[Hook]
I need like 10, 10, 10
I told you niggas I need 10, 10, 10
For a show I need like 10, 10, 10
For that bag of dope I need like 10, 10, 10
On my lil hoe I spent like 10, 10, 10

[Outro]
I need like 10, I need like 10, I need like 10, I need like 10
I need like 10, I need like 10, I need like 10
I need like 10, I need like 10, I need like 10, 10, 10
I need like 10, 10, 10
I need like 10, 10, 10
I need like 10, 10, 10
I swear I need like 10
