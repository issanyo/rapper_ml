[Intro: OBN Jay]
Shit I been doin' my thing
Swervin' from lane to lane
OBN

[Chorus: OBN Jay]
To be honest, I be thuggin' by my lonely
Niggas be hatin' so I keep this thirty stick on me
Wanna be sober but I'm always smokin' palm trees
I don't spare nothin', you better get your lil homie
Shit I been doin' my thing, I know you know who we are
Swervin' from lane to lane, all out the drop, bitch I'm a star
And I pray on my knees, 'cause I might not wake up tomorrow
And I'ma buy what I need, it's up from here, it won't be long

[Verse 1: OBN Jay]
Been thuggin' since Pampers, they say that I'm evil
Watchin' them junkies shoot up with that needle
Caught my lil cousin, yeah I gotta feed him
Greg gone in the grave, man I hope I can meet him
Pops went through some shit, I was raised by Tameeka
Hop out the Sprinter and jump in the Beamer
Go pick up that pack when Lil D say he need them
I laugh at the faces of all of my teachers
Ran up that bag and now they mad, they say I ain't gon' blow
Bitch don't hit my phone without no bag, I need fifteen a show
Lil bitch screamin' my name, this OBN shit everywhere I go
I want a hundred million, I wan' see that shit before I'm old
I been stackin' benjis, I'm committed, I ran up my digits
I'm on a lil mission, so my glizzy, I keep this bitch with it
The money ain't a thing, all my niggas gon' chew this shit with me
Chasin' for that fame, this big Glock nine gon' open up your fitted

[Chorus: OBN Jay]
To be honest, I be thuggin' by my lonely
Niggas be hatin' so I keep this thirty stick on me
Wanna be sober but I'm always smokin' palm trees
I don't spare nothin', you better get your lil homie
Shit I been doin' my thing, I know you know who we are
Swervin' from lane to lane, all out the drop, bitch I'm a star
And I pray on my knees, 'cause I might not wake up tomorrow
And I'ma buy what I need, it's up from here, it won't be long

[Verse 2: Quando Rondo]
The life that I live, man it's all 'bout survival
When it's up, bitch it's stuck, leave 'em dead on arrival
Gotta post with lil Leeky when I'm in the trenches
I just got a new glizzy with a built in extension
Every day chasing money, I gotta go get it
Leave his brain in the street, I'ma aim at his fitted
When I ride 'round my city they know I'm the menace
Best believe if I start then you know I'ma finish
VVS diamonds put in by the dentist
Word 'round the city they think I'm the dentist
Brand new Mercedes, they think that it's rented
I stay strapped with a Glock when I'm walkin' through Lenox
Got a big big bag, if I want I can spend it
So many hundreds, smash out with no limit
Girl if you want it, you know I'ma spend it
These niggas be hatin', they know that I'm trending
I stay with them racks like I'm 'bout to play tennis (rrah rrah rrah)
Shots fired off, now the nigga's body missin' (grrah)
Walk 'round the corner, go leave the car parked
Brand new FN, when I shoot it go bah
When it's up, bitch it's stuck, they gon' draw the white chalk
When it's up, bitch it's stuck, they gon' draw the white chalk, yeah

[Chorus: OBN Jay]
To be honest, I be thuggin' by my lonely
Niggas be hatin' so I keep this thirty stick on me
Wanna be sober but I'm always smokin' palm trees
I don't spare nothin', you better get your lil homie
Shit I been doin' my thing, I know you know who we are
Swervin' from lane to lane, all out the drop, bitch I'm a star
And I pray on my knees, 'cause I might not wake up tomorrow
And I'ma buy what I need, it's up from here, it won't be long
