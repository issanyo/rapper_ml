[Chorus]
Only reason why I went on that lick 'cause I got tired of hustlin'
Mama couldn't pay the bills and I know she tired of strugglin'
Ever since I was lil one I ain't had nothin'
Walk a mile in my shoes, you'll see that I ain't frontin'
I know one day I'm gon' make it, 'cause I grind for it
Distance myself from that fake shit, I ain't got time for it
No, no, I ain't got time for it, no no-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Tryna stack my money tall like them twin towers
On your block I make it rain, that's a bullet shower
I want money and respect, nigga, fuck the power
Hundred shooters comin' silent, that's a hundred vowels
Tryna get money, nigga, fuck these bitches
In my own lane, yeah I'm on my road to riches
I just fuck â€˜em then I duck 'em, I don't love these bitches
Gave her my heart, she fucked that up, so I don't trust these bitches
Plenty times in that cell, I caught a couple cases
First day out, no wasting time, I went back to them basics
I'm chasing dead faces, I'm feeling be-traited
I finally made it, them niggas they hatin'
The fact, damn my name was ringin' bells
Locked up in the cell, ain't nobody on me pay my bail
Deep off in that water, I was swimmin' just like Michael Phelps
Lost my nigga Quahfee, I swear you ain't know how it felt

[Chorus]
Only reason why I went on that lick 'cause I got tired of hustlin'
Mama couldn't pay the bills and I know she tired of strugglin'
Ever since I was lil one I ain't had nothin'
Walk a mile in my shoes, you'll see that I ain't frontin'
I know one day I'm gon' make it, 'cause I grind for it
Distance myself from that fake shit, I ain't got time for it
No, no, I ain't got time for it, no no-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I know Lil Leeky gon' kill for me
And I know that Rufus go hard for me
I know that Pac gon' send shots for me
Do drive-bys out all of them cars for me
OZ'll take out his heart for me
Kenny did time in that yard for me
It's a lot of shit Flash taught to me
It's a lot of shit Flash taught to me
If it's pressure with them niggas we gon' gun 'em down
When it's beef bitch we creep, we gon' run you down
My favorite alphabet that K, it shoot a hundred rounds
Boom at the blood to cross the mouth about a hundred pounds
Potato on the barrel, swear that it won't make a sound
And we ain't squashing shit, you know I'll lay you down
Leave 'em in the lost and found, I'm the sickest in my town
It get wicked in my town, so you better not play around
And you know we be on that gang shit
Disrespect that gang, swear to God you'll get your brain split, yeah
RIP Quahfee three times
My niggas they with it, we just buried about three nines

[Chorus]
Only reason why I went on that lick 'cause I got tired of hustlin'
Mama couldn't pay the bills and I know she tired of strugglin'
Ever since I was lil one I ain't had nothin'
Walk a mile in my shoes, you'll see that I ain't frontin'
I know one day I'm gon' make it, 'cause I grind for it
Distance myself from that fake shit, I ain't got time for it
No, no, I ain't got time for it, no no-oh-oh
