[Intro: Project Youngin & Quando Rondo]
Lil Project Youngin man, can't tell me nothin' man
Quando Rondo nigga, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Quando Rondo & Project Youngin]
Lean got me in my feelings, codeine bleedin' when I'm pissin'
Came a long way from them trenches
It was yesterday that we was strapped up with extensions
Mama told me chill but I ain't never wanna listen
And it felt like yesterday I ain't have a dime to my name
'Nother dime on my bracelet, 'nother twenty on my chain
Road running for this money by any means, yeah
I'm just a youngin chasin' dreams, yeah

[Verse 1: Quando Rondo]
It was just like yesterday I was that youngin in them projects
Diamonds on me shining, got me drippin' like a faucet
I know a blood that's amigos, no Quavo or Offset
Remember wearin' Levis, now the youngin rockin' Balmains
You gotta take a loss just to be the boss man
Police pull me over, I'ma give they ass a a false name
See I ain't got no time to be locked up behind them walls man
My last girl was trippin', had to cut that bitch off man
Just to focus on the check, I'm steady thumbin'
Quando Rondo nigga, on the track with Project Youngin
Like a magician, I turn nothing into something
Took off with that ball, I ain't fumbling, nah

[Chorus: Quando Rondo & Project Youngin]
Lean got me in my feelings, codeine bleedin' when I'm pissin'
Came a long way from them trenches
It was yesterday that we was strapped up with extensions
Mama told me chill but I ain't never wanna listen
And it felt like yesterday I ain't have a dime to my name
'Nother dime on my bracelet, 'nother twenty on my chain
Road running for this money by any means, yeah
I'm just a youngin chasin' dreams, yeah

[Verse 2: Project Youngin]
This for them days I felt played, waitin' in line for them J's
Now them J's in line waitin' on me to serve they ass that yay
I came too far to ever turn around now
Gotta watch my every move, they sayin' that I'm a star now
And now them kids look up to me, sayin' I'm who they want to be
Glad I motivate 'em but my daddy wasn't nowhere to be
Found, he got the fuck from 'round
It's crazy I never met him, but bitch look at me now
And it felt yesterday was thuggin' hard, takin' losses before I start
Me and Mook sleep in that car, tryna sell all this hard
Stayed down 'til I came up, I just played my part
Feel like yesterday lost Boola and Bighead, I miss them boys

[Chorus: Quando Rondo & Project Youngin]
Lean got me in my feelings, codeine bleedin' when I'm pissin'
Came a long way from them trenches
It was yesterday that we was strapped up with extensions
Mama told me chill but I ain't never wanna listen
And it felt like yesterday I ain't have a dime to my name
'Nother dime on my bracelet, 'nother twenty on my chain
Road running for this money by any means, yeah
I'm just a youngin chasin' dreams, yeah
