[Intro]
Pourin' up for them real niggas
We gon' roll one up for the real hittas
I’m working online
Quando Rondo nigga

[Verse 1]
All the real niggas in Heaven, man I need someone to call on
Nowadays these phones tap, I'on even wanna talk on 'em
Gotta very long road, these niggas, they never walked on 'em
My back against the rope, she cut her ties so I can fall on 'em
You wasn't built to hold shit down, that’s why you turned your back on me
You couldn't hold me down, even if you ain't on some gravity
I built my own empire, they tryna tear down my masterpiece
I think they mad, I turned my dreams into reality
See I was grinding out my [?] I feel like Master P
Pourin' up for them real niggas
Roll one up for them real niggas
Dope boy dreams, sip out the cup for them real niggas
Post in the cut with them real killas
Loyalty run deep [?]
Blood in the streets, bussing my veins don't [?]
