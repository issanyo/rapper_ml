[Intro]
Ride for me nigga, yeah
Promise you gon' ride for me nigga, yeah
I don't know where the fuck you found this shit
Quando Rondo nigga
Five four three two one, I'm 'bout to take off
Five four three two one, I'm 'bout to take off
Five four three two one, I'm 'bout to take off
Speakin' facts nigga, gang

[Chorus]
I hit the gas and take off, I'm on another planet
Collect from Domo, he told me don't take this shit for granted
Quahfee got killed and ever since I ain't have no understandment
I can't slip up 'cause if I do who gon' take care of my family?
I ain't like these other rappers tryna ride fancy
I just wanna buy a house for my mama and granny
Out of space, out of mind, I'm on another planet
Out of space, out of mind, I finally landed

[Verse 1]
Fans call me Quando Rondo, family they call me Tyquan
Hardaway livin', I be feelin' like Derez De'Shon
Hard in the paint, sittin' in the Accord, ballin' like LeBron
Never had nothin', I just want to be a champion
Only thing I want to know is why these niggas envy me
Steady smoking cigarettes and steady sippin' Hennessy
Beatin' on them cards, tryna get inside the industry
Free my nigga Icy, he was wildin' while he in the streets
I made it to the top, now everybody say they kin to me
Pockets filled with guap, now she want to be a friend to me
Don't wish jail on nobody, fuck it, free my enemies
I do this for the man up above, swear I drop to my knees
Teagan don't you worry 'bout what they say 'cause it's just you and me
I gotta take advantage of this fucking oppurtunity
Stay ten toes down, the only thing you gotta do for me
No question about it, I know Lil Leaky he gon' shoot for me

[Chorus]
I hit the gas and take off, I'm on another planet
Collect from Domo, he told me don't take this shit for granted
Quahfee got killed and ever since I ain't have no understandment
I can't slip up 'cause if I do who gon' take care of my family?
I ain't like these other rappers tryna ride fancy
I just wanna buy a house for my mama and granny
Out of space, out of mind, I'm on another planet
Out of space, out of mind, I finally landed

[Verse 2]
I remember I ain't have nowhere to go, so Pooda took me in
Leaky told me in that jail cell it's family, no friends
I started kickin' in them doors to help my mom pay the rent
Bedroom was in the basement, studio in the den
I'm tryna get up out the way, and stack up my ends
It's kind of hard to keep faith, lord give me the strength
At night on my knees I pray, lord forgive me for my sins
Stay the fuck up out my way if you ain't gon' ride to the end
Where the fuck was you when I was locked up in that cage?
K Swiss was on my feet and I just wanted them new J's
I know a lot of niggas they gon' change on me
I know a lot of niggas in it for the fame only
Where the fuck was you when I was locked up in that cage?
K Swiss was on my feet and I just wanted them new J's
I know a lot of niggas they gon' change on me
I know a lot of niggas in it for the fame only

[Chorus]
I hit the gas and take off, I'm on another planet
Collect from Domo, he told me don't take this shit for granted
Quahfee got killed and ever since I ain't have no understandment
I can't slip up 'cause if I do who gon' take care of my family?
I ain't like these other rappers tryna ride fancy
I just wanna buy a house for my mama and granny
Out of space, out of mind, I'm on another planet
Out of space, out of mind, I finally landed

[Outro]
I hit the gas and take off, I'm on another planet
Collect from Domo, he told me don't take this shit for granted
Quahfee got killed and ever since I ain't have no understandment
I can't slip up 'cause if I do who gon' take care of my family?
I ain't like these other rappers tryna ride fancy
I just wanna buy a house for my mama and granny
Out of space, out of mind, I'm on another planet
Out of space, out of mind, I finally landed
