[Intro]
Go Griz

[Chorus]
I Know it ain't easy tryna love a thug
You say that you need me
Telling lies under your breath
I got your back through whatever
If you call I'm pulling up
Girl we in this forever
At least I thought that’s what it was
It don't matter, whenever
Girl you know I'm pulling up
Clutching my heavy Metal
I fill my glizzy up with slugs
I know sometimes it get stressful
When you feeling so deep in love
But baby girl you so special
I fill your pockets up with dough

[Verse 1]
Theres something about you I just can't explain the feeling
Every time we argue you hate to explain your feelings
When you had left a part of me it went to missing
Push start Mercedes let’s hop inside then we hitting it
We leave in the benz and pull off in a wraith
Brand new Mercedes, she doing the race
Open the Glock Imma shoot at his face
Fuck from the back put that hoe in her place
[?] bought the ounces in ya
Every show on the road I go strapped with a K
I’m alone in [?] got a house in the 8
I told lil shawty I’m gone gotta go catch a plate
Late nights to the early morning she gonna go and get it
Plus we got something in common she on the road to riches
Everything that you wanted I granted all your wishes
I told her" shawty I love her" but my heart in the trenches

[Chorus]
I Know it ain't easy tryna love a thug
You say that you need me
Telling lies under your breath
I got you back through whatever
If you call I'm pulling up
Girl we in this forever
At least I thought that’s what it was
It don't matter, whenever
Girl you know I'm pulling up
Clutching my heavy Metal
I fill my glizzy up with slugs
I know sometimes it get stressful
When you feeling so deep in love
But baby girl you so special
I fill your pockets up with dough

[Verse 2]
She telling me I need to chill it off them perkys
Deep in these streets she praying can't nobody hurt me
Look at lil shawty I swear to god she the baddest
She stand up and turn around I swear she look the best
She say that Quando the realest and I’m like really really
And every I be spitting she tell me I'm the illest
She wrote me letters in prison
Telling me how she miss me
Karma ain't none of my bitches
I was blowing these kisses
I told lil shawty I love her
And she like "ah for real?"
She remind me of my mother
And Im like "yah for real?"
She super bad and bout a bag
She want it all for real
Any time I'm feeling sad
She wonna call for real

[Chorus]
I Know it ain't easy tryna love a thug
You say that you need me
Telling lies on the under your breath
I got you through whatever
If you call I'm pulling up
Girl we in this forever
At least I thought that’s what it was
It don't matter, whenever
Girl you know I'm pulling up
Clutching my heavy Metal
I fill my glizzy up with slugs
I know sometimes it get stressful
When you feeling so deep in love
But baby girl you so special
I fill my pockets up with dough
