[Intro: MC Eiht]
Geyeah, we in the motherfuckin' house
Eiht Hype in the motherfuckin' house, geyeah
1/2 Oz in the motherfuckin' house
My Niggas on the Run in the motherfuckin' house
Lil Hawk and Burn in the motherfuckin' house, geyeah
And ain't no love in the nine-fo' ho

[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
It makes me want to jack motherfuckers in the fog
Let them hood rat bitches know the true meaning of a dog
Makes me want to be a nigga, for hire
Let five-oh feel the motherfuckin', fi-yah
Hold my nuts and make my cash
Break this ten and a half off in your ass, uhh
Walkin' with a strap and a bad ass rap
You get off first, before your enemy tries to peel your cap, uh-huh
And bitches can't hang with the pack
Fools talkin' smack, it makes me smack you right back
Niggas got beef 'cause Eiht Hype's a mack
And since the age of thirteen, I've been packin'
Fool I slang a gang of twenty bags
Thick stuff in my pocket makes my khakis sag
Always on the lookout for the, helicopter
Blast from the AK fill the fuckin' copper
It's do or die, motherfuckers die
Niggas from the Compton streets so don't even try, nigga
You get slugs from the snub for offendin' me
Ain't nuthin' but the gangsta in me

[Hook] x3
Nuthin' but the gangsta, yeah

(Spice 1 come down)

[Verse 2: Spice 1]
I am a G, yes I'm only a G
Walks like a G, talks like a G
So A to the motherfuckin' K
It's your one eight seven proof ass nigga from the Bay
Run up because uh my gat's quick, to slap shit, pistol-whip they ass
I'mma do the blastin', Eiht you get cash and
Dash, the fuck out the cut
Fifty bullets up in the next nigga that's how we runnin' up
I pulls my hat to the back and I slide when a motherfucka peelin' his cap
Pick out my nine millimeter uzi -- barrel chrome, handle plastic
So killamatic killamatic, killaman killaman with me Glock
Piggedy pop motherfucka, watch em drop, motherfucka
Just a G, comin' up out the Bay with a fat AK
Put it in your face and split your wig nigga, zag to zig nigga
Disrespect me I'mma bank ya
'Cause I'm nuthin' but a motherfuckin' East Bay Gangsta

[Hook] x3
Nuthin' but the gangsta

[Verse 3: Redman]
Check it out
Oh my God! I destroy cities like The Blob
Droppin' trunks of funk and I blast a punk from here to Cape Cod
Fuck a job, my organization runs like the mob
The original Joe Pex Flex, Redman bitch you better ask somebod
Prepare to slam from here to Japan with jams
I'm from the Jersey section and I keep it real for ninety-four and
I can't march on swap meets, y'all duck sects I dissects
But I pack a nine gat and the cops, still don't know where mines at
Black, huh!! I snatch the Beauty from the Beast
It's that funk deceased nigga comin' thru bitch so grab your hairpeace
I got the gangsta in me plus I'm not friendly
To a bitch-ass whose mouth runs more laps than the Indy
Now let me spice the track up, MC Eiht pass the bone so I can get lifted
And a head can get blown when Bronx pass the biscuit
I drop the funk and drop a body to show I'm serious
The gangsta means I'm live, rappin' from New Jersey, period!

[Hook] x8
Nuthin' but the gangsta

[Verse 4: MC Eiht]
Hit the weights everyday like Popeye the sailor
Bailin' with my starched up khakis and Chuck Taylors
Just touched down from San Quentin
Hand me that fresh ass Pendleton, uhh!
It's nuthin' but the gang, thing
Makes me hit the corner and slang
Board and quarter about a hundred times
Don't be servin' no dubs and dimes
But I do it, no hesitation
Fuck it, I'mma violate probation
No one gave a mad fuck about me
Since the age of eight I roamed the halls of LB
Pops boned out never had a big brother
Put on the set when I could pick the right color
The homey put me down on a half a bird
Turned it into key now they buyin' from me
Rollin' in the Trey on fuckin gold d's
Nuthin' but the motherfuckin' gangsta in me, geyeah

[Outro]
Nuthin' but the gangsta, yeah
Nuthin' but the gangsta, come down
And that's how it's going down
That's how it's going down, uhh
1/2 Oz in the motherfuckin' house
Niggas on the Run, Lil Hawk and Burn
Nuthin' but the gangsta (x4)
Yeah
