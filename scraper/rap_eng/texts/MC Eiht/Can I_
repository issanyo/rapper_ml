Geah
Compton
For the millenium
Gangsta
Two thousand and one
Gangsta
Geah
And we doin' this
For the thugs
Ride with your nigga

I can recall the past for y'all
How it started off of small and grew up tall
How it started off soft when they hit the water
Outcome when it's hard that's half and quarters
It's the - lifestyle of the hundred and ??
Mo' money you bring make it hard it to flaunt it
No money can't chase rats they like cheese
If you got money they ain't to please
They ready to freaky it givin' you the ultimate climax
They only out for fucking with niggas with contracts
That's the life in two thousand and one
Still packin' a gun, niggas On The Run
If you rock that shit move slow (move slow)
It's like a jungle sometimes for sure (jungle sometimes)
If you don't make snaps perhaps it don't work (chin chin)
Fuck around in the game you get hurt, geah

Can I get money? Yes you can!
Can I run the block? Yes you can!
Can I get money? Yes you can!
Keep the game on lock? Yes you can!
Can I get money? Yes you can!
Can I run the block? Yes you can!
Can I get money? Yes you can!
Get hoes to jock
Geah

Anybody got beef with the hood ho that
Some hot hollow points to lay your ass flat
Kidnapped that fool be the number one rule
I learn that lesson way back in school
Gimme the mic, the money and the chronic and I'm straight
Fuck the pussy I had it from the gate (geah)
Hey ?? bitches and play was known
Played hoes big time when they chase the dough
Y'all know the
Money and thugs make the world go round
Cop the next chance money for fucking pounds
If you got beef then bring some mussle
Compton niggas bring supreme hustle
On the late night hype y'all watch your back
Enemies do creeps so watch your step
I do pack heat if y'all ready to meet
True thugs motherfuckers with harder streets

Can I get money? Yes you can!
Can I run the block? Yes you can!
Can I get money? Yes you can!
Keep the game on lock? Yes you can!
Can I get money? Yes you can!
Can I run the block? Yes you can!
Can I get money? Yes you can!
Get hoes to jock
Geah

Criminal mind since the started time
Can't knock out the hustle so y'all bend the rhymes
Gimme mine is a long time come in fact
It's a long line to thugs down with the tacts
You can fall straight back or get you needs dirty
The bird flies fast we get the one early
The late nite hype reveal your blood tight
Another subsist to blow you're base kite
Boo-yaa!
How in the fuck you like me now
Orginal from the west loc making you bow
Take a butt-naked bitches complete the pow-wow
Heads turn
We raise your high row
Praise the stakes chase my life is plates
It's a brand new year with the new five gear
Keep chronic smokin' blowin' in the atmosphere
Eiht did these niggas what y'all have to hear

Can I get money? Yes you can!
Can I run the block? Yes you can!
Can I get money? Yes you can!
Keep the game on lock? Yes you can!
