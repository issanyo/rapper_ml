Like the L.A. Lakers
We tryin' to be a money maker
But that's kinda hard to do amongst a gang of salt-shakers
So how can money can a nation when playa-hation do
Think about it, probably of couple niggas playa hatin' you
Because you got a lil' sommethin, trying to keep shit tight
Not at the bar, gettin drunk, trying to pick a fight
But mad niggas got it backwards like they ass was in the front
Actin' like they smoke rock and now grass up in they blunt
I gots no words for em, just 'fist of fury' like Bruce
I let loose on they ass, then hit the fence like Juice
And don't be a broke nigga fuckin' everybody's bitch
Niggas'll get mad cause they gotta pay for this shit
Just cause you got more game then a next man, don't make it bad
Every real nigga got a hustle to 'em, even your dad
So do what you gotta, but don't cross that line
You get yours, I get mine, and everything'll be fine

I needs money, that's why the palm itches
Masterplans and schemes, so I can get riches
Potent 20's to double up's and quarter pieces
Fancy cars to condos with ????
Pops out the dream (chin-chin)
Cause it seems the corner just ain't workin
In the cut, down the alley, see the one times lurkin'
Everybody packs a sack skrill's not to large
I hooks up a sweet deal with Chico De Barge
Me's the shit, shippin, price is way to high
I could take my chips by ?the product?, double up, kinda fly
Cops the work but still strap cocked by the side
Asked the bitch that I fuck if she was gon' take the ride
Reply: cool!, what's my take on a china white sack?
A thousand, bitch, to your ass, everyone that come back
She say: cool baby, I'm in, try to regulate this cheese
Kept a smile on my face while she dropped to her knees
Picks up the phone and call Chill ?????
But you's a fuckin' hard line they might ?????

Touch down for pounds so I can makes my loot
Look for a long hair, redbone in a Nike suit
Don't look suspicious, leave yo' dough at home
Straight out the airport, hit me on the pay phone
To the ho-tel, mo-tel
Whatever pleases, just get my mail
You knows the business
Extra care with the sacks
16 and done spent, bring 24 bag
Don't let them show change on the pack
Cause if they do, 187 is the fac'
Did you make it, okay ?????
I'm on my way back with your pay
Life is lookin kinda lovely to me
Regulate out the state with the ghetto D
My connection's tight, so don't believe the hype
But y'all keep hypin, I make money off of the pipe

All I needs is my strawberriez -n- cream
All I needs is my strawberriez -n- cream
Gettin' paid is the American Dream
All I needs is my strawberriez -n- cream
