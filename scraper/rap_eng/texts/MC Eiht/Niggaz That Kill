Geah

Eihthype in the muthafuckin' house, nigga
Half ounce

Niggas on the run in the muthafuckin' house
Lil' hawk & bird in the muthafuckin' house
My nigga ric roc in this bitch
C. M. W. Back in the house for the 9-4

We in it to win, motherfucker, it's do or die
Don't fuck around with eihthype, it's suicide, nigga
How'd you figure we hold the trigger and let you slide?
Murder raps like I step, we hit when we hoo-ride
You knows that, when we rep, homeboy, I thought you knew
Caps get peeled when we chill, it's the west side, fool
Like a dope fiend I steal to your fuckin' jaw
Left connects, then I switch to the southpaw
You gets the boom ping ping
Listen to yo' motherfuckin' cranium crane
And as you fall down you see the barrel of my gat
You get a chill
For fuckin' around with niggaz that kill

Uh geah

Boom bam and chill is niggaz that kill
Lil' hawk & bird quick to grab the steel, niggas that kill
My nigga ric with the bomb, a nigga that kill
And niggas from compton, niggas from compton
