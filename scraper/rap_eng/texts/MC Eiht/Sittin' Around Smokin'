[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
I'm gonna keep it hood shit LOC I get mine (geah)
All day with a geah man push that line
Hot boys on the turf block hot with ones
Routine pullover for the dope and guns (geah)
But I don't sweat it
Compton keep it hood nigga never forget it (I got you)
Fuck who shot you
Somethin' for the OG niggas to hop to
Geah pop through. The land what you in it for?
Couple thick hoes bailin' out the liquor store
They love real niggas who ride for the set
Beat the pussy, got the hustle down and all that shit (geah)
I'm with that, anybody tryna eat
Anybody in the struggle tryna stay on their feet (geah)
Homeboy you like that
In the meantime nigga I'm comin' right back

[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
I'm on it all for the money, good pussy, and trees
And for the stage show work slide a couple of Gs
Under-table work no need for papers
Mr. Telephone-man sure tryna tape us
I'm no new edition but the mission is new
But I'm back with the mic sounds nice, one two (my mic sounds nice)
Geah check got snaps to collect
All day we can get high and that's on deck (geah)
Nigga never hand cuffed man
Light that up, got enough what is puff
Geah, get the mind right
Fuckin' with the west it's a long fight
Any night nigga spot back
Compton in the spot, nigga where you at?
Follow the good smell in the back with the hoes
Thick {weed} regulators posse up real quick
