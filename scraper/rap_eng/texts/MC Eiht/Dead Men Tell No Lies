I been quiet for too fucking long so now its time to break the silence
I start with the killing so fuck stopping the violence
I got something for your monkey ass. So peep
Better yet like a stray dog I put your ass to sleep
No more faking and taking my snaps
Sorry fool, Eiht goin' step 'n get the straps
Geah, I puts my work in and fuck up your shit
Now you gotta bow down and suck a fat dick
Mmm. I guess thats what you get when you try to play
Try to come up with that mutherfucking he say
Or she say, or what the fuck did that fool say?
Punk bitch, I'll mop that ass up anyway
Dont misbehave, cause you'll be a slave
Another fronting mutherfucker in a early grave
Geah, you got over fool because your ass was sly
But a dead nigga tell no lies

[killed off the sucker right there he didn't stop... X2]

Another fool on my shit list
And now the punk bitch wanna play games
No competition so I'll mention no fucking names
Just like a rat, she likes to squeel
But you squeeled on the E, so whats the deal?
Geah, you spread rumours for humour G
But the shit ain't funny, so humour me
And um, ain't no more of your bullshit I'm having
Geah, Tired of the fucking back stabbing
Soul in the bozac, as I stack
To your jaw I start to mack. Like a fool don't clap
And um, it ain't over till the fat bitch spit
Well the fat bitch is about to spit shit
To save your sorry ass from the mash
So who really gives a fuck if I tap that but
So um, when your ass is gone, they'll wonder why
But a dead nigga tell no lies

[killed off the sucker right there he didn't stop... X4]
[Ran through the rooms and went pop, pop, pop.]

Get ready for the last mutherfucking trip
As I pop in another mutherfucking clip
Geah, one more busta, another mark
Fool your kinda fake, talking about you fucked the Eiht
Damn, another sorry bitch with some street slang
Peel his cap cause we ain't from the same gang
Talking about you'll shoot the Eiht from the top of the tree
Nigga please, I might drop you to your fucking knees
Try to lay low, but you know you can't escape
Why'd you have to diss me on your underground tape
Now you hang your shit up on a shelf
Didn't you know, you'd be fucking your own self
Quick draw McGraw, on the fucking draw
As you scheme on my team I take 2 to your jaw
Geah, you got over fool, but you know why
Cause a dead nigga tell no lies

[killed off the sucker right there he didn't stop... X2]
[Ran through the rooms and went pop, pop, pop.]

Geah, Eihthype in a mutherfucking effect
For the nine deuce to get loose
My nigga Mike T is in the house. Dj Slips in the mutherfucking house
My nigga 'Times in the house, Rick's in the house
My nigga Chill's in the house, Boom Bams in the house
And we outta here....
