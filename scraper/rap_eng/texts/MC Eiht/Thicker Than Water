Gyeah
Westside
Somebody told me
They want some of that thug shit up in here
Gyeah
& I'mma represent it to the fullest
C'mon
For all my CPT G's in the house
Check this out

[ VERSE 1 ]
As my life takes a twirl
I say fuck the world
Cause sometimes it seems
That it's all a bad dream
Pops must have fucked with moms
On the scheme
But sooner or later
He left our 2 man team
But fuck him
Times done changed I'm in the game
And I bring moms pain
Cause the game is slangin caine
Cries from my eyes as I hits the street
Pounds in the chest tha heart beats
As I roll with heats
Pops wasn't around but for a minute or shit
Until he skipped across town
With another bitch to stick
Stuck moms one more times
Then dropped a dime
And on top of that
Had a son same age mine
But, uhh, don't blame me
Cause Lord I try not to
Have an attitude like 'fuck him until I die'
But now I rebel and cause moms hell
And hit the blocks
Cause I'm into makin illegal mail
Gyeah

If you keep your hood tight
Everything's gonna be alright
If you're down then you can ride with me
It's thicker than water baby
Me and you
It's thicker than water baby
So what we gon do

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now I runs with a gang
That Hoo-Bangs for fame
And crosstown robberies know tha nickname
Leave 'em dead in they shoes
As we servin the blues
G's that pack tools pay dues to rule
So it's cool they dumps and we dumps back
Me and my G's and the 6-4 black
Layin 'em flat Rata-Tat-Tat
From the Gat and shit
We represent y'all hit the bricks
When the pistols spit
And I had a straight bitch and shit, that's cool
I slang for cash while she hit the books in school
I live and die for the hood, she knew the rule
Love for this thug when the world would seem cruel
I crips where the enemies dwell but I'm no fool
Undercover drive off strapped with the tool
But I slipped then packed my clip
My hoodrat tripped and didn't scoop
But they still didn't shoot
Gyeah

Chorus 2x

[ VERSE 3 ]
I made it to Deuce-5 baby and that's luck
In this rap shit to try to make some bucks
(ching , ching)
Seems like the gang bang thang got tougher
A little bit younger but then bit rougher
They been tellin me
To watch out for jealousy
Cause now a friend of me was a enemy
Strange the game done changed switched
Ain't that a bitch
With the rivals makin some change
In and outta lanes in the passenger seat
Me and you and our crew strapped with heat
Outta town runs for funs no beef
We all hit licks and blows the chronic leaf
But payback's a bitch in the end you know
And she sets up traps
Cause she snatch for dough
Let it go no come up your last trick
Cause my brother's got my back
When the shit gets thick
