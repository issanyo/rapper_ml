Heeeyyy, Uhh, Half Ounce in yo mouth
Check it out, Half Ounce in the house

Chrous: Bring the yellow tape nigga FOSHO
Playa hatas infiltrate us niggas HELL NO
Fools ready to die
Don't be afraid
Bring your gun and your sac cuzz we under attack

Verse 1:
Takes no chances
End with up that least circumstances
Keeps a cool composure
One time's takin those glances
Who be's your enemy on the evilest team
Racketeerin all your C.R.E.A.M.,
Havin your worst bad dreams
Pesos for all the amigos
And the sistas
How ya likin us now
Competitas gon' bow
Ain't nothin' top dollar straight corner to corner
Keeps my hand in the pie like little Jack Horner
SOLDIERS on my left right ready to die
Infiltraters six feet keeps our head to the sky
Its a cold cruel world tryin to watch my back
Got these cold ass thugs ready to ride and jack
SHIIT!! For the paper
Street Dreams and all
Best be ready to hit the doo' when the one times call
Gots the picture its still for the money son
And if you're bailin' through Compton you betta bring a gun

Chrous: 2x

Verse2: Boom Bam
I deliever my blow it could be fatal
Get yo ass smashed like potatoes and gravy
Maybe with some prctice you can fade me
But I doubt it, Picked up the Compton time
And read about it, How my crew makes the front page
In a rage, In a live concert blowin blunts on stage
People swingin' on a chasity and got the place packed
To the maximum capacity, People comin from far and near
To get a glimpse of these gang-bangers, playas and pimps, check it out
When we roll we rolls thick like some nappy ass hair
Straight chronic smoke up in the air
So get it straight nigga
Boom-Bam and Eiht nigga,(GEEYYAA)
Peeped yo' game from the start nigga
We know you fake nigga
We gots to keep a close eye fools under our backs
Lock the gates sound the guns cuzz we under attack

Chrous:2x

Verse3: Mc Eiht
Betta' watch out for the murder I wrote, Black super spokes
Black stars and a black leather coat, On a mission
Dead presidents I gots to stackin, Enemies can't see the ya-ya
In my jacket, Best raise up before I set it off on G.P.,
First rule if you tryin' to bring harm to me
Felony case catcher to the first degree
Like the ginger bread man yall can't catch me
On the run stilla nigga held no jail cells
Keeps two steps ahead, No traces for feds
Phone taps instead, On the celluar phone
Dumb as fuck cuzz they don't know the number was called
Outta the country, D.A. on the payroll yall
Me and a little senortia on my side the black heater
Sweeter than the rest, Paid pounds at gate sippin
While shippin to the U.S.A.,

Chrous:3x
