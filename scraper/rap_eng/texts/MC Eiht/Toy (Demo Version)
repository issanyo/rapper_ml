Into (MC Eiht):
Geah (4x)
What’s happenin’
Blue Stamp Official (official)
The nigga Eiht in the building
Geah (5x)
Blunts and lipstick, you know niggas be....
Jonathan Hay, Ranna
What’s good (I love my car)
It’s Compton
Keep it official (I love my gat)
Geah
Let me tell you how I feel about that

Verse (MC Eiht):
The best thing that I got (geah)
I’m regulating your spot (geah)
Just me and my girlfriend, my bottom bitch so hot (so hot)
Jealous ones do envy (envy)
God damn I’m sprung (I’m sprung)
All day I fantasize filling up my lungs
Coughing I do often, I never leave you for them
My other broads they sweating me
Nigga, where the fuck you been?
Smell all in my clothes, all over my room
I need to hit that one mo’, don’t leave me soon
Soon as I get home, I’m putting up that chrome
Lick a little then roll up, take it straight to the dome
All day every way, geah nigga, enjoy
My girl trippin’ my weed smoke, I’m a little kid with my toy
I don’t share with my friends
I don’t spend on my ends
Ride around with you all day, ain’t no need to pretend
First choice, second place
Never that, no case
Can you be my favorite toy?
Big kid like baby boy
Geah!
