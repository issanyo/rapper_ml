Wake yo punk ass up for the 93 shot
MC Eihts in the mothafuckin house
Geah
And it ain't nothin but a compton thing y'all
And we ain't nuthin but niggas on the run
And this goes out to my niggas
Geah

A fucked-up childhood is why the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn, hmmm
Somebody help me
But naw they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escaping cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin'
And on top of that got moms sprung
Scheming of the top
Pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone & that ain't no good
Gotta follow in the footsteps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggas putting brew
In my fuckin baby bottle, damn
And through all the mothafuckin' pain
They done drove my Mom's insane
So I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I'll grow up to be a streiht up menace, geah

Uh
C'mon yall
Streiht up menace

Now I'm of age
And living in the projects
Gettin' paid off the clucks and the county checks
I'm finally fresh outta High School
Never did I wonder
That the mothafuckin hood would take me under
Geah, I'm kickin' it with the homies and they got the straps
Off to the corner store owned by the fuckin
See a bitch in the right lane so I comes with a mack
Astro van, pulls a mothafuckin jack from the back
Now he's got the strap to my homies head
See I'm playin the shit cool and don't be a fool
He shot my nigga in the fuckin head
I caught one in the shoulder if I didn't run I was dead
Now I'm laying in the hospital bed
Thinkin' about them punk mothafuckas and my eyes is bloodshot red
Geah, mothafuckasI ain't finished
Be on the lookout for the streiht up menace, geah

Uh
What's up ya'll
Streiht up menace
Damn
Really
Really
Streiht up menace
Damn

I'm in too deep
I done killed the mothafucka and I just can't sleep
One Time's tryin' to do a smooth - creep
And on top of that
Niggas after me for fuckin one of they hoodrats
I ain't got time for the fuckin bitches story
Niggas want me got to come to my territory
And ain't no you can get out this
Niggas come and they get done on their own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay? Cause I don't wanna punk out
Or what should I do?
The homies say the hood
Where it's good homeboy I thought you knew
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react caught 2 in the chest
Now look who's down I guess I'm finished
I go out like a streiht up menace, geah

Uh
C'mon yall
Streiht up menace
Damn
And on that note
I guess we out of here
Peace to my niggas on the run
And we ain't nothin but streiht up menaces
Damn
Just like I said before y'all it ain't nothin but a Compton thing
And MC Eihts in the house for the 93 shot and this one's for the niggas
Geah
