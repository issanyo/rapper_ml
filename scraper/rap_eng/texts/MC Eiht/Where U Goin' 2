[Verse 1]
I reminisce like Pete Rock
Loc where the smoke go?
I take the heat, and take it back where they loco
I blow the point
Compton's Loc'd Out
On the D.L keep a low profile
Niggers don't smile
So the rounds tell
Hustle be the M05 of hell
Yell! when they come
Where bang from!
Check on the tattoos
Swatting the income
And i dont sweat a motherfucker cuz I'm on one
Cuz the things ya been doing, niggers been done
Geah' Eiht on the Rampage
