[Verse 1]
Niggas premature, wet dream
I'm all for the money, mo' cream
Full head of steam like a chronic cloud
I bang for the west, say it loud
Wild loc, straight out the hood
Niggas calling me Eiht cause the 38 snub
Couple shots now they off and running
Maybe a couple more till the cops start coming
Funny how they floss, broke ass
Loc's in the hall, no pass
Stomp on a couple, old news
Catch em' before they running out they damn shoes
I'm tryna stay paid
Me and my bitch, loc
Sipping on top grade
Shots of the liqour
Money is the plan so I double up quicker
Think it and want it
The shit get thick then roll your dice smarter
And thats the life sometimes
Follow along and read between the lines
Can I get a G'eah, 1 time
Couple of niggas fight G'eah but its still mine
Real shit there, but i'm back
Funny niggas is reppin' so they up under attack
G'eah

Compton Zoo, you know how we get down
Blue Stamp get em'
Compton Zoo, we should examine carefully

[Verse 2]
I reminisce back when they die to get in
How he died for the cause, ride straight to the pen
What up
Niggas take that ride
Everyday in the struggle nowhere to hide
Drive by music loc you ain't lie
Tried to stay straight, you know I try
Lied to the 1-time's
Got heat in the trunk but it ain't mine
Working and stashing
Couple of clients so I might keep smashing
No thinking what am I to do
Hide the evidence and don't give them a clue
Lifestyles of a nigga in the struggle
Regulate the spot with the neighborhood muscle
No warning, take over ya' spot
The homeboys plot for whatever you got
G'eah you the 1, yo' {racks?}
I split em' with the homies like kick backs
Kick back its real O.G's in the place
Motherfucker so the gat gone squeaze
G'eah

[Hook]
Compton Zoo, you know how we get down
Blue Stamp get em'
Compton Zoo, we should examine carefully
