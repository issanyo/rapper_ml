[Intro: Slim 400]
Wake your bitch ass up, nigga
Doing it for the real ones, nigga
Out here getting money the real way, nigga
Taking chances and more shit, you feel me?
Four-block
Bompton
Woo, woo, woo

[Verse 1: Slim 400]
The streets I walk down
Ain't no bickin', it ain't bool with it
Real niggas in the hood got beef
I live in the hood, so I gotta deal with it
Young nigga, I ain't knowin'
I just live with spruce
Flyin' church, red strings
G's equipped to shoot
Every morning like night
Niggas handle business
Dice games in the hood
Seems like it's never ending
And when 12's hit the block
It's like they always trippin'
Niggas done lost they life gang bangin'
And they always gifting
Life's fucked up
I ain't seen realer than the real go
Bet I hold it down
And my name is what I live fo'
I'm turned out in the block
And [?] did it
I'm in the mirrors
Day and night after I get it
Life's a gamble
I go hard, I spend it
Pick the bags and shit up
No I ain't forgettin' it
Play with this block shit
You'll lose your life
I didn't make it out the struggle
Without thinking twice

[Interlude]
RIP my rider, nigga [?]
RIP Big [?]
My nigga Chaotic

[Verse 2: Slim 400]
Wooooo, now im of age
With a '32 under my granny couch
I been out here fucking up
So I left the house
But I was still giving the chips so I ain't leave her out
Out here hittin' licks with the homie so I'm cashin' out
I was taught to go big, ain't no holdin' out
Because that'll lead to a fist fight, then the guns is out
You my real one, I ride by, I chuck it up
And if the beef on, I come through and I eat it up
Black choices, I chose to put a flag in it
[?] pockets, Spruce street and I sag with it
That Slim fo', I ride or die, I don't give a fuck
And it's 32, it turned [?] into a bastard
Run up on me and get your ass whupped
These streets turn me into a savage
Everybody turned to back out and I don't know what to do
I stuck to this rapping
Oh baby [?] got it brackin', from the weed sales to the cocaine
To the [?] packs out on [?] street
On the hood, nigga I've been active

[Outro]
