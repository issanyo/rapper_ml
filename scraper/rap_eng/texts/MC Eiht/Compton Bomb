Makin' niggas lock up they low-rider switches uh
Step aside as I bail on my ride
Too close on my jock get bucked with the Glock
The whole world turns as I bail in the room
Niggas prepare to get slapped with the boom
Now for a bit to think ???
Got more sacks than my man Richard D
Can't get it nowhere but the West fool
Fuck around with the stress and that ain't cool
You can't handle my shit when it's smokin'
One mo' big ass hittin' and start choking
You can't handle this son so pass it quick
Damn I'm starting to see your mind playing tricks

Only the west side fools supplies the bomb
Hitting your ass like a sawed-off pump

The bust that'll last long not a quicky
You know it's on when the shit looks sticky
So come get the bomb from the Eiht, Chill and Bam
