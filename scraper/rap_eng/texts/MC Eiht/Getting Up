[Verse One: Young Aidan]
A fucked up childhood, but I ain't trying to complain
Just trying to go obtain, whatever I can to get some fame
But that ain't what I'm in it for, humbled from beginning poor
Remember all the visions torn, with nobody giving more
Then a single fuck about him, people never stuck around him
Went in with everything, but there never was an outcome
Home life was so trife, such a cold description
But that I'll have to talk about another time, know its written
Thats just life though, it is ice cold
When you might go, is un-quite known
Back to the topic I was not with any group in town
But I just threw the smile I used in doubt through the clouds
Where do I go without a soul to be hitting up?
Nobody knows but I may just be letting up
I ain't lived enough to try that ending just
Hoped and prayed for one day that I'll be getting up

[Hook: Young Aidan]
Getting up
Getting up
Getting up

[Verse 2: Young Aidan]
Some fucked up teen years, still ain't gonna complain
Coming up with one way, to make it in this one lame
World with no opportune-nitty, how I got in tune to be
On the block and shoot, now to hoop or off a dude, really
Its just thats just whats expected of me, all the Borough will cook
Moved to Guildwood for a bit, but I was still hood
Now I ain't trynna promote the life, but wanna show I know its like
To know right from wrong, but to know it gets you left for life
Always loved Hip-Hop, so I thought I'd write it down
Recited loud, and the sight has now turned into quite a sound
Help the next one up going through everything expressed above
Try to make the best of what they're given to go step it up
And right now, you probably didn't get it but
Remember what I said though, because I think I've said enough
Don't care who be ahead of us, no pressure but the message just
Is talk now, its time to rock because a young'ns getting up

[Hook: Young Aidan]
Getting up
Getting up
Getting up
Getting up

[Bridge: Sample from the intro of the video for "Live Your Life" by TI]
Sometimes on the way to where you're going you might think
This is the worst time of my life
But you know what?
At the end of the road if you can get where you wanted to be
You remember what don't kill you makes you stronger
And all of the adversity was worth it

[Verse 3: Young Aidan]
One fucked up life, Im grateful I got the chance to live
Cause at the end of the day, I got a chance to live
I won't lie, I wasn't always playing silly putty
Pretty gully, chilling bummy with nothing ever given to me
You can see the kid is hungry, nothing else will fill the munchies
Everyday Im getting higher, nothings going to kill the buzz he
Making, its amazing, how I came in on Awakened
Now I'm staying, in this lane and never taking a vacation
I used to cry for help, I've learned to wipe my tears
Turning my darkest of secrets into some bright ideas
I used to cry for help, I've learned to wipe my tears
Being a bitch will never work, not going to try Madea
Am I clear? Im grateful for this blessing but
I curse in each verse out of amazement I'm getting what
I've always wanted; and there is no guessing what
Is coming next, please enjoy, this is Young Aidan: Getting Up

[Hook: Young Aidan]
Getting UP
Getting UP
Getting UP
And now I'm Getting UP
