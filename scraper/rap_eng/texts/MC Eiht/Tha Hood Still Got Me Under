[ VERSE 1 ]
I tell you it's hell up in Compton, know what I mean
Niggas'll keep you dumpin plottin for cream
On a late night tip straight chasin your dream
Just a young knucklehead tryin to run with the team
Moms and Pops tripped and slipped into the split
Now the days got tight cause this nigga wasn't gettin shit
The old fools down the block said: you're dumb
If you sling that white they will come
Now I know the game 50 double into the C- note
The beach cruiser flipped into the el camino
My hoodrat bitch done got a little class
Swap meet jewelry to tight jeans with ass
The .380 tucked away in a stash
The old school tapes I pumps in the dash
Just so I can smash
Sometimes I wonder how the hood life could last

[ Hook ]
The hood still took me under ( somebody help me out )
That's true
The hood still got me nigga
Like you
Gettin money on the blocks with my crew ( I don't wanna be here )
I'll be a thug nigga till my days is through
Come on
The hood still got me under ( Somebody help me out )
That's true
The hood got me nigga
Like you
Gettin money on the blocks with my crew ( I don't wanna be here )
I'll be a thug nigga till my days is trough

[ VERSE 2 ]
One-Times is gafflin that's the story
Another drive-by, another territory
Seems that they got a nigga all shook up
Y'all know we run the fuckin streets if we all hook up
But fuck it back to the fat packs I cook up
Your clientel down the block I straight took up
Dead presidents I got to stack it (ching-ching)
Infiltrators can't see the [ ] in my jacket
Lord you gotta forgive me for bein a thug
Niggas cross the frontline, catch the slug
Bullet cracks the window, body hits the rug
Burn rubber-sound means a nigga just dug
Out the crime scene back to my section
Slippin in the dark, shoulda had protection
That's how it goes never take shit lightly
Hoo Bangin gangstas thinkin just like me
