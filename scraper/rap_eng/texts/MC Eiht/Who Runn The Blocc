[Intro: Young Maylay]

[Verse 1: MayLAy]
MayLAy shoot the shit since the youth at risk
The big homies knew what crew to pick, who was with the missions for the hittin'
Someone's breakin' and enterin', others takin', deliverin', the caterin', the kitchen men
The difference then, blacks owned hella houses
If you was snitchin', wasn't livin' to tell about it
If you was right, we'd fight all day and night
But doing wrong, you on your own for life
I'm from Los Angeles, big guns, women, and cannabis
Niggas can't run from where the cameras is
Cause when the bird hit the light, it turn midnight bright
Another term for the chips, with the flicks and the kites
We like lowriders, and hogg motorcycles
And we’ll go psycho, with rifles like white folks
Tell em' Eiht, its West Coast, till my eyes closed
With one shot, plus a blindfold

[Chorus: MC Eiht]
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Hood so deep, we got heat and jam knocks
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Eiht and MayLAy, all day, bust shots
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Hood so deep, we got heat and jam knocks
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Eiht and MayLAy, all day, bust shots

[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
One time, swoop up on the blocc tryna take mine
I hop some fences
Now it's a footchase, tryna dash for freedom
It's money over everything, we don't see ‘em
Fuck the census, since I was a lad
It was hood took me under, motherfucker I'm bad
Sad day, the homie got jacked
And shot in the process, geah that's wack
I get em' on everything, we get back
Necessary be the time, geah when shit crack
Community resources the source be
My income streak, and they come so regularly
The enemy come, so ya better be ready G
So, when I aim, better hold it steadily
Shit, call it the warzone, life in the land
Where it's follow the rules or they reprimand
I rep for the west, so the Eiht can handle
Compton for the hood's what the fuck I stand for
Geah
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Geah, geah, geah…

[Chorus: MC Eiht]
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Hood so deep, we got heat and jam knocks
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Eiht and MayLAy, all day, bust shots
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Hood so deep, we got heat and jam knocks
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Eiht and MayLAy, all day, bust shots

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm on the blocc, with a 30 deuce deuce
And a colt 45 like Pac got Juice
Still a nigga struggle, so the yay produce
It's all for the money, so a nigga could lose
Cuz, it was Nissan trucks
And the ugly rat bitch, back then, was a duck
I told the hoe bitch, get the duck sick
Round up the baby gangsters, hit a lick
One shot, now its life up state
The homie from the hood turned up my cell mate
Love for the hood
Hater motherfucker gave a nigga all day, but I stay all good
I hit the streets, right back in
One time's on my coattails, niggas can't win
That's the motto, hustle hood rich
Compton all day, yes, fuck a bitch
Compton forever, West the best loc, yeah keep it together
When it's cruising down the street, in a lowrider
Eiht and MayLAy, all day, Westsiders, geah

[Chorus: MC Eiht]
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Hood so deep, we got heat and jam knocks
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Eiht and MayLAy, all day, bust shots
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Hood so deep, we got heat and jam knocks
Who runn the bloccs?
Who runn the bloccs?
Eiht and MayLAy, all day, bust shots
