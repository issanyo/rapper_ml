Get ready for the apocalypse
Because a nigga know he can't stop this
And fool had to figure, when my tongue is the trigger
Now a piece in my mouth is releasing buckshots
No escaping because perpetrators get smoothed popped
So raise the fuck up cause the Eiht is gonna hit you
With another gangsta lick
But not a rap about a bitch
Or a ho, or a ho with no kinda guts
Who gives a fuck what your saying so get these nuts. Geah
It's the nigga that you cannot bite, no
Thick like steel, you can't kill the Compton psycho
Here to woof a little shit about your punk ass
Get the cash, make a 100 yard fucking dash
But I ain't through, gonna take your ass up
St. Ides brew as I wait for you in the cut
I guess I'm starting to see your tired of me
It's tough, nigga say Eiht is enough
Damn, watch the Eiht go very deeply
I don't think that your fucked up style could taunt thee
I'll fuck that ass, take your cash
And this nigga keeps on sticking till you just can't last
Geah, I need the money so fuck the dumb shit
And the hell with being legit, so watch out for the hit
You can't juice this, it would be useless to try this
Down your man like a can of St. Ides
And right then I start to kick
And better hope the Eiht don't get too sick
Cause if I cough, I won't stop, I'll keep bussing
I'll just pause and take a spoon of Robotusin
And take this shoe in a size ten in a half
Put it in your ass cause your making me laugh
Geah, and I deal with bustas like a duster
Nigga say Eiht is enough-ah
Mmm, one more for the fucking road
8 seconds to get out before I explode
Boom and that spells doom for your crew G
Niggas can't fade the Eiht and the Mike T
Bitches can't fade us neither
Always learn to get burned by a heater
Mutherfuckers need to come to they senses
Fuck with the Eiht and suffer the consequences
Saps always do the mutherfucking bragging
Fools couldn't light my blunt with a dragon
And to the bitches that got no clout
Bring a shovel so the Eiht can dig you out
Geah, I'll put a hurting to you punk suckers
You can't gank me fool, unh uh fucker
Its the nigga from the free wheel prison
Compton Compton nigga, that's how I'm living
And if you fuck with that I'll call your bluff
But don't forget motherfucker, Eiht is enough

Geah, back for the motherfucking nine deuce
Putting my foot in your ass just a little bit
And you know I can't quit, so fade this shit. Fool..
