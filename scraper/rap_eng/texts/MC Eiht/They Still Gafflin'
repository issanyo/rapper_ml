They Still Gafflin
Damn, MC Eihts back in the mutherfuckin house
Last year we came with the one times gaffled em up. y'knowutumsayin"
Now the whole mutherfuckin world know

They still gaffling, this young black nigga
So why in the fuck should I sleep when they creep
As I roll through the streets I see another raided house and
Thats why the Eiht'll be out in 5000
And the fools won't give a chance to explain
If you're from Compton, you either sell dope or gangbang
Yo those fools on my dick still trying to jack me
I guess because I sport a hat and the khaki's
And if my cars on hit then I'm a roller
Bust a U, hit the sirens and pull me over
Run a make on my plates, fool they legit
Another day for this punk ass bullshit
I was lucky, I threw the blunt in my sock
The first thing they say, who's got the gat who's got the rocks?
I said please officer, I'm a rap singer
Boy you from Compton you gots to be a banger
Wheres your hood, whats your set, throw up your gang sign
I takes my hands off the hood and says I ain't got time
He's says park it fool times is wasting
I said fuck you, black leather glove slapped my face then
I was pissed, it was rough, my hands was cuffed
If I told them they stink they'd throw my ass in the clink
So it was back to the curb and I sat
All that time, fools didn't even find my strap
But every day its the same shit happening, yo
Watch your back one times still gaffling, geah

Geah, now they still on my dick
Still all wrastling, gaffling and shit
Can't take no more off this one time shit. Y'knowutumsayin?
I'm ready to peel a mutherfuckers cap, y'knowutumsayin?
Check this out

Off to the kick it spot to make an end
Early in the morning so my day can begin
I seen the fool that tried to double cross me
I beat the punk down smooth cause I'm the boss, E
2 niggas rolling, in hats, inside a cadillac
We start to blaze up the mutherfucking 20 sack
We rolled the windows up to get that contact
One times seen the smoke they pulled a smooth jack
On top of that I was bumping big noise
It was the fucking CHP boys
I didn't like those punk fools one bit
Cause they be popping that KKK shit
So I kick back and played with the routine
And told the grand dragon I was 17
Tell the police the truth then how the fuck that sound?
Cause if I told him the truth then I'd be county bound
So I play with the routine, comma
While he say, hand over the marijuana
I said officer, you must be joking
That was a cigarette I was smoking
So I sat with my but to the ground
And kept on thinking would the fool beat me down?
They didn't find the gatt, it was a miracle
But they still toed my mutherfucking vehicle
I might as well have packed a strap and
Get rid of all these one times gafflin

Geah, I'd like to send this out to all the mutherfucking homies
That be getting there asses kicked by the one times, y'knowutumsayin?
And all my mutherfucking homeboys
Thats in jail locked up over this punk ass shit
The one times be gaffling y'knowutumsayin?
But they can't keep a brother like the MC Eiht down
Me and my DJ Mike T is like out 5000
