[Intro]
Jyeah
Aw where my ladies at baby?
(I'm in the place to be)
Jyeah
Oh where my ladies, mon?
(I'm in the place to be)

[Verse 1 — Bootsy Collins]
Ladies, tonight's about you
We're here to celebrate everything that you do
Filling the world with your love and compassion
Surpassing systematic madness from the fascists

Teaching the masses the goals of the earth
Since they birth you was worth more than gold
A million to they own
I gotta love 'em all, babe
Tonight's about y'all, have a ball, babe

[Hook]
Uh-ruh-ruh-ruh
A salute to the ladies (alright)
A salute to the ladies
A salute to the ladies (huh huh)
A salute to the ladies (alright)

[Verse 2 — Aziza Love]
If it's a man's world, then I'm the man girl
It's ladies night, we can take over the damn world
See, I'm a wallflower, not a dancer
A few drinks and I might just change my answer

So come and kick it with the tribe if you feel the vibes
Every time I spit a rhyme, the font come alive
I had the funk since I was five, [?]
Born 1990 but I'm way ahead of my time

[Chorus — Bootsy Collins]
I want a chocolate caramel latte
For my pretty young thangs with the patte
My Latinas, son bueno
My South American girls do the tango

Is she Asian, or white chocolate
Well my island girls theys gonna drop it
It's time to play tonight
'Cause this is ladies night

[Interlude — Aziza Love]
Baby
I see ya, see ya
Ya wanna roll with me? (maybe)
If ya get up, get up
You could get down with me

I don't gotta know ya (know ya)
I'm in the place to be
Ladies, ladies
So won't you come and roll with me (come on and roll with me)

[Verse 3 — Bootsy Collins]
Ay you're quick with the wordplay, jyeah word
Any body want problems, absurd
Club city one time buy your O.G. a drink
Kick back watch the beat get spank

She wanna smoke marijuana
And Ben Coller's all "dude, California"
Selfies with some OGs
Yeah and I said "Oh please"

[Chorus — Bootsy Collins]
I want a chocolate caramel latte
For my pretty young thangs with the patte
My Latinas, son bueno
My South American girls do the tango

Is she Asian, or white chocolate
Well my island girls theys gonna drop it
It's time to play tonight
'Cause this is ladies night

[Verse 4 — Aziza Love]
Yes, I be the melanated win
Friends all call me Z
I'm the urban so queen
From the five one B Yuh
Yes they tryin' they test me
I'll pass it with class, ass, pizzazz
Spaz on the track, no

You'll never be able to witness
Another example of greatness
Quite like me
Got my ladies beside me
Let my ancestors guide me
Stayin' humble, grind quietly
So my family takes pride in me
It's time to see

All my fellow moonshine
Think you know it's primetime
Give into the bassline
Waistline, looking right, young and tight
No need to fight, 'cause we all-stars
No need to set, I write my own bars
And I know that you've seen us
Come straight from venus
And I know that you know
We the cleanest and the meanest
[?]
[?]
Come on queen, show me what you got

[Chorus — Bootsy Collins]
I want a chocolate caramel latte
For my pretty young thangs with the patte
My Latinas, son bueno
My South American girls do the tango

Is she Asian, or white chocolate
Well my island girls theys gonna drop it
It's time to play tonight
'Cause this is ladies night

[Bridge — Bootsy Collins & Aziza Love]
This is for them girls
With the afro-puff curls
Straight to the back
Come on ladies... where ya at?
This is for the queens
Sportin' sneakers boomin' bassdrop and
Tie your shoes and combat boots and
Ladies, it's your time to groove

[Chorus — Bootsy Collins]
I want a chocolate caramel latte
For my pretty young thangs with the patte
My Latinas, son bueno
My South American girls do the tango

Is she Asian, or white chocolate
Well my island girls theys gonna drop it
It's time to play tonight
'Cause this is ladies night

[Outro]
Jyeah
Oh what a night, waffle
I'm in the place to be
Ladies, ladies
So won't you come and roll with me?
(All night, baby)
