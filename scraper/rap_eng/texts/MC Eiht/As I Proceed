Yeah nigga Eiht back in the game
Runnin' you suckers crazy

[Verse 1]
I'm Built for speed so the dough come fast
You hear the sound of a shotgun blast
Niggas set it off so it's all competition
A few homies on the road to perdition
Your hands in the air with your mouth shut
G shit in the buildin' bitches go nuts
[?] scenario Gs and gents
G niggas had their money well spent
Hoes bend over, show what you got
Slap your own ass, girl you're too hot
I break it down fast [?]
Undercover so the Os don't spot
I'm tryna push it in the fast lane
Couple flips, tryna tighten up my cash game
Same thing different day
A couple hits on the blunt it's okay

[Hook]
Geah, geah, geah, geah
I'm built for speed
As we proceed
To give you what you need, geah
Geah, geah, geah geah
I'm built for speed
As we proceed geah
To give you what you need

[Verse 2]
A nigga move the crowd like a hood Rakim
Shots might rain so the lights get dim
Been a long time nigga back on the set
Put it down for the hood so it's really don't sweat
Niggas thick tryna push through the door
3 [?] so the gat don't show
And we ain't fuckin' with the [?]
Sneek 'em in the club just in case we gotta gat clowns
So hot start a fire on the roof
Niggas chest out feel real bulletproof, geah
Don't let your ego trip man
Then your girlfriend pop by the waistband
She like a bitch with a attitude
And I ain't mad we just spittin' at them other dudes
Rude awakening, hearts gettin' broke
Money on the floor end up in smoke

[Hook]
Geah, geah, geah, geah, geah
I'm built for speed
Geah as we proceed
Geah to give you what you need
Geah, geah, geah, geah
I'm built for speed, geah
As we proceed, geah
To give you what you need

[Verse 3]
I been there and done that
And right back
And keep it all hood so I'm on the right track
I'm westcoastin' three wheel motion motion
A couple raps and nigga that's promotion
We gettin' high all night
Niggas got cheese when the rats come bite
Pass the light, we LOC'd after dark
Them niggas come out, the shootings gon' start
We at the good part, been payin' our dues
We came from the streets so it's nothin' to lose
All hip-hop news report the week
Some fools release when they should not speak
Niggas want beef never turn the other cheek
One shot make your brain cells leak
Get a sneak peak niggas pull [?]
OG from the hood niggas walk this way

[Hook + Outro]
Geah, geah, geah, geah, geah
And I'm built for speed
Geah as we proceed
Geah to give you what you need, geah
Geah, geah, geah, geah
I'm built for speed
Geah as we proceed
Geah to give you what you need
Geah
Keep it Compton
My nigga Brenk Sinatra on the beat
