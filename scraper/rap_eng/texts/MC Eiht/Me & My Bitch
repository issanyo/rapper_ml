Geah (check it out)
One two, one two
Hey
Geah (one two one two)
Check it out, uh

I can't fuck with a proper bitch
Cause she wants me to save her
I can't flow
I'd rather fucks with a greedy bitch (geah)
Cause the bitch is much cheaper
So here we go

[HIE TIMES]
There's a thin line between a dollar and a hand which just connected
With that hand belonged to you then you'd be the one that's most suspected
So to deal with this here, I needs all of mine
Cause stacking G's and smoking trees is really all that's on my mind
And I'm trying to find me a chicken with thick legs and smooth skin
With a cool panty line and lots of paper to spend
Cause where me and Eiht about to go
I know there's chickens for days
You best to bring your Ben Franklins
But never will we pay to play
It's more the other way around cause nowadays that's how it goes
So grab the rest of your girls and let me put a lock on this door
We gon' to be doin this all night or release till we run outta smoke
But see that shit will never happen so just prepare to get stroked
Cause the way we like to do don't get no better than this
Mission one is now done, hop in the Beamer with Slip
So while the players are still hating, trying to ruin the game
You'll see Eiht and Hight T travelling plane to plane

I can't fuck with a proper bitch
Cause she wants me to save her
I can't flow
I'd rather fuck with a hoodrat
Cause the bitch is much cheaper, so here we roll

Geah
One two one two
Geah
One two one two
Check it out
One two one two
Geah

When I gotta
Rolls Royce for the bitches that want up in it
With a black super sport next to a 5 hundred Benz
Ends out the anus making 'em famous
Racketeerin now I'm flippin while I'm tipping and taking trips 'cross the border
Under cover watch my ki's keep jinglin'
Got the page from my nigga H.B. he's bringin
Top dollar bitches, who got love to give
Ain't no time for playing games, get down like you live
We might spend a little ends tonight, so get it cracking (geah)
No time for masquerades, Boom Bam pull down the shades can we hurry
I got a little business at 9
Quickly I slides out
To the next hide out
Underground tunnels
Can't see me on top
You know my little senorita
I roll for the drop
Keeps me paid
Cause ain't nuthin' changed but the weather
No sneak attacks she's strapped with the Beretta
Whatever y'all bounces and whatever y'all ounce is whatever you need
We deliver with speed

I can't fuck with a proper bitch (geah)
Cause she wants me to save her
I can't flow
I'd rather fuck with a hoodrat
Cause the bitch is much cheaper
So here we go, uh

Just me and my bitch, me and my bitch
By any means do anything to keep us rich
She hops on the plane for the return trips
In and out, back and forth just to stack my chips
I said...

Nobody knows my name, who's in the limos?
Tinted windows, fuck toss in the demos
Wrong one son, heavy weights the rap
And if you can't start with a hundred best beware for the cap
Keep it moving and guns keep tucked up in the coat
Judge Dredd and the feds on my back when I float
Gots my little senorita on my way to the shop
I'm on my way back to the West to plea no contest
False arrest
But y'all know how O.J. did it (geah)
Cost about 2 million get me straight acquitted
D.A. on the payroll, two steps ahead
Keeps a smile on my face, you in a ?powder? of red
Best bring my cash and don't be late
My senorita with your product get it straight upstate
Locked down
Got a gang of stories for my celly
Return trips with chips strapped to her belly
Meet her at the telly, collect my fee
While your counting from the pen, I'll hit y'all up at 3

I said
Me and my bitch, me and my bitch
By any means, do anything to keep us ritch
She hops on the plane for the return trips
In and out, back and forth just to stacks my chips

I can't fuck with a proper bitch
Cause she wants us to save her
I can't flow
We'd rather fuck with the greedy bitches
Cause they outs to get paper
So here we go...

Uh, Half Ounce one time (hello!)
Check it out
Half Ounce one time
Just me and my bitch
