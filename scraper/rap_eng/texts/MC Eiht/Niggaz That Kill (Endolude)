Geah
We in the muthafuckin' house
Eihthype in the muthafuckin' house, nigga
Half Ounce
We in the muthafuckin' house, uh
Niggas On The Run in the muthafuckin' house
Lil' Hawk & Bird in the muthafuckin' house
My nigga Ric Roc in this bitch
C.M.W. back in the house for the 9-4

We in it to win, motherfucker, it's do or die
Don't fuck around with Eihthype, it's suicide, nigga
How'd you figure we hold the trigger and let you slide?
Murder raps like I step, we hit when we hoo-ride
You knows that, when we rep, homeboy, I thought you knew
Caps get peeled when we chill, it's the West Side, fool
Like a dope fiend I steal to your fuckin' jaw
Left connects, then I switch to the southpaw
You gets the boom ping ping
Listen to yo' motherfuckin' cranium crane
And as you fall down you see the barrel of my gat
You get a chill
For fuckin' around with niggas that kill

Uh geah
We in the motherfuckin house
For the 9-4, nigga
Killin'em off
Niggas that kill, uh
Buck buck, nigga
You gets fucked by niggas that kill
We pack that muthafuckin' steel
Niggas that kill, geah
Mc Eiht is a nigga that kill
My nigga Slip is a nigga that kill
Boom Bam and Chill is niggas that kill
Lil' Hawk & Bird quick to grab the steel, niggas that kill
My nigga Ric with the bomb, a nigga that kill
And niggas from Compton, niggas from Compton
You know how nigga from Compton do it
Geah
Niggas that kill
Buck buck
Buck buck
You gets fucked by niggas that kill
