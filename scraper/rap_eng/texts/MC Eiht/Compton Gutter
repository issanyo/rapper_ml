They say the gutter leads to the ocean , well you can find me in LBC  on a boat  with Goldie Loc posted

So they can fuck one of theses bitches
Nigga yawl soft , is that the first thing that comes to a niggas mind , they low budget thinkers , I stay on the grind 
A hundred spokes and this weight , all make this Chevy slide

Just flossing guide my 64 out the   "Gutter lane"  Crips Bloods and SA's we all on a paper chase , 20 years from now , I wonder who gone escape , my lil homie died and my love ones is locked away , gotta keep the faith head up and walk straite in the gutter got a nine bye my damm wast the spot is hot any nigga wanna take my place  , I laugh and let the nine run across a nigga face , the Gutter ain't safe I know your moms warned you , about fucking with me , and you can't afford to

3rd (Verse Mc Eiht)
I was born in the 70s ,raise your black fist Bebe kids doing flips off the mattresse , right at this times I was peeping the Ogs , the old school Chevys nigga , bumping the oldies
You know me drive bye relax , I rep for the homies in high power max , tracks of my tears ,Cuzz the hood did courted 
The 501s the T hat I sported , I caught it a couple cases on the ricochet   Compton from the Gutter. Fucc them  niggas  say
The took us under , no wonder we all heated , the robbery in progress the funds depleted , the Afro American Dream
It's Compton 4 life trying to get me some cream, so the music reminisce like a old church hymn , Cuzz fucc all of they when the lights go dim
