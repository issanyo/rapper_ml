Geah, you know how we do it
For the 9 to the 7, geah
C'mon chin chin

Gimme those keys, freeze like One Times in a raid
Scheming off the top of the pow to get paid
Let's take a trip back - like Minnie
A place where they fast cutting - like Vinnie
I know - lots of drama
Your momma comin' through in a short skirt straight looking for work
It's my man Boom Bam in nod
(hey... hey yo what's up Bam?)
Coming up in the game I swear to god
Customers roll through - every minute
One Time's right after - trying to hit it
Pesos to hood rat hoes, oh yes
Can't - shut us down cause this Tribe's on the Quest
Possess the baddest sacks to have your block sewed
Interference - we giving a clearence to get float
Hold - up, geah wait a minute
A car full of chronic smokers yeah and I'm in it

I gotta gets the money
Gotta gets the money cause I needs the cash cash, c'mon geah

Gotta gets the money cause I needs the cash cash, c'mon geah

You know I need the money
Gotta get the money cause I needs the cash cash

My shit is kinda difficult to swallow
Here comes the hollow
I be the leader so you follow
Payback's tomorrow
Willie green's on the caper - who get the vapors?
Used to love you now I hate you - won't bring me the paper
These B.G's gon' stay alive
Can't knock my hustle from the West nigga 9 to 5
Greenery to - blow, Cristal in the glasses all the way live
S-5's to S ??
Bitches gon' get in where they fit in
Finding my tag a nice Rag Top to sit in (geah)
Baby the bomb this bitch-ass nigga has ever seen
Down to get cream, wanna be on my team
Buy you some - cause these G's is for hire
20 sacks to burn on 20 inch tyres
Who's under fire - not gettin' paid is what you're facing
Geah, check it out, paper chasing

You know I need the money
Gotta get the money cause I needs the cash cash c'mon hey
You know I need the money
Gotta get the money cause I needs the cash cash
Check it out
You know I need the money
Gotta get the money cause I needs the cash cash c'mon hey
You know I need the money
Gotta get the money cause I needs the cash cash

Picture me rolling as I take a hit
As I floss my shit
With the fresh chrome kit
Hating because the player's ball
Like Big Mike something serious leaving nigga straight delirious
Curiosity killed the cat
Gots to get my cheese cause in this game a gang of fucking rats
Plotting to get they ??? on
They ??? on, eating cheese until your fucking skrilla's all gone
You all alone
Remember this phrase(geah) : starving like Marvin
Ain't no better fucking days
Want a piece of the pie? Take my advice
Hit your block sales and watch out for the fucking vice
Fuck the One Time, fuck the gov-ernment
They still ain't send no love
Biz lick cause 25 is what you're facing (geah)
Continue to clucks the rock, paper chasing
