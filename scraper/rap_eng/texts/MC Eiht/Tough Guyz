Yo
Geah
Yo
Half Ounce in the house, what?
Check it out, check it out
Don't be comin' around my way with that tough guy shit
Only West Side allowed and we won't get hit, geah
We got the ho's locked down
Half Ounce in the house
It's like this
Mon Diggi
Yo
Stick 'em

[MON-DIGGI]
My visions outta focus cause I lit the hocus-pocus
All I'm leavin' for you vultures is a couple of cockroaches
Mon-Diggi split your wiggy - probably incidental
When I rape your instrumental but we gon' keep that confidential
I really can keep a secret but you tellin' lies
Hesitant to represent
You like a bitch in disguise
Talkin' about you need a trend so you can wet the tough guyz
And suspense is your evidence, lay it to scuff guys
Must I - do the cappin', I would love to keep rappin'
But I heard you always packin' and bitch-made when it come to scrappin'
Mon-D, sinister M.C. is X-fac'in'
Lookin' for your captain so I can smack and P.D. wack him
My tactics are more than just bad bitches and back
Shiiit, Jackie Chan would fuck around and get his ass blasted
Stupid bastard - Diggi blessed the session
Niggas in my section are lookin' for some new direction

[EIHT]
Don't be comin' around my way with that tough guy shit
Only West Side allowed and we won't get hit
We gots the ho's locked down from town to town
And we keep on payin', don't give a fuck what you sayin'
Don't be comin' around my way with that tough guy shit
Only West Side allowed and we won't get hit
We gots the ho's locked down from town to town
And we keep on playin', so fuck what you sayin', geah

[BOOM BAM]
We got problems that you wouldn't believe
The world is filled with hatred, player haters and greed (geah)
And I can't lie - cause we all done took part in it
And ain't no pointin' no muthafuckin' fingers of who done started it
You gotta be down for your get down
You gotta be ready to put your hit down
Then ready to split your grip down (geah)
The middle - gotta be fair
Signs posted in the hood, all niggas beware, now check it
(check it out)
One Time can't maintain no order
They the ones gettin' checked, need a restrainin' order (chin chin)
Against niggas like me that's on the warpath
So get your umbrellas ready because the forecast is gloomy
My extra large T-shirt be roomy
For the gat that I pack, new jacks that wanna do me
L.A. is the place where punks die quick
(Half Ounce is the click you can't fuck with)

Don't be comin' around my way with that tough guy shit

And we keep on playin' so fuck what you sayin'...

Criminal minded's the kingpin, I starts my lootin'
Killin' these bitch-ass niggas when I starts my shootin'
Hundred miles and runnin' stops from the cops
In the back seat hops as I starts to pop
Givin' a fuck, got the extra clip in the under cover
Blast with the ski mask, blame it on another
Old dirty E from the C-P-T
Still kill from C to shine M.C
Deadly catastrophe
Competition, compete it's costly
Killing you softly
Holes in your body with the shotty (boom boom)
Where's the party, it's killin' any - body (geah)
Ho's turn silly like the ???
Evil stunts like ??? packs my piece
Before I escape, uh
Eiht ain't done yet
Kill 'em all
And ride into the sunset

Don't be comin' around my way with that tough guy shit
Only West Side allowed and we won't get hit
We got the ho's locked down from town to town
And we keep on playin' so what you sayin'
Don't be comin' around my way with that tough guy shit
Only West Side allowed and we won't get hit
We got the ho's locked down from town to town
And we keep on playin' so fuck what you sayin'

Geah
Come on
Half Ounce in the house
Half Ounce in your mouth bitch
