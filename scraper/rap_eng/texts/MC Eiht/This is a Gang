Niggas duck as I make another hit, the psycho just don't quit
And I'm living in the land of the fucked up shit
I guess everybody's hungry for the motherfucking snaps
That's why my niggas peel caps
Got you on the damn run like Ron Brown
And when we start to clown, we shut your whole fucking hood down
And I see some hesitation
I shot your homey 3 months ago, so wheres the fucking retaliation
No, I didn't think so
Another punk bitch I pimped like a hoe
Mmm, I dont think you sorry clowns wanna see me
Age 13 living life like a B.G
Hand me the damn 38 so I can set the score straight
And let the enemy meet his fate
In it to win it and I don't give a fuck!
Yo listen up

[This is a gang, and I'm in it.]
[Compton's Most Wanted, punk, rolling 4 deep]
[This is a gang, and I'm in it.]
[You don't like how I'm living well fuck you]

2 years pass in O.B.G
Spent half of my life in L.P
Geah, now I'm out and I'm ready to sweat
A sorry fool who ain't down with my fucking set
Nigga, stay clear of the gun blast
If you thinking about ducking you better duck fast
Oops, too late you got popped in the process
Another point for the hood, one laid to rest
Like a cannibal, I wanna see meat
Killing punk fools from the wrong side of the street
Me and the homies rolling 4 deep
Niggas on the run all strapped with fucking guns
Ain't no time for you to think about ducking
When we start thinking who we start sticking
Like I said, I don't give a fuck
Yo listen up

[This is a gang, and I'm in it.]
[Compton's Most Wanted, punk, rolling 4 deep]
[This is a gang, and I'm in it.]
[You don't like how I'm living well fuck you]
[This is a gang...Compton's Most Wanted]
[This is a gang...punk rolling 4 deep.]
[This is a gang, and I'm in it.]
[You don't like how I'm living well fuck you]

A tisket, a tasket
Geah I see another one of your homies in a casket
And to me, that's a fucking shame
Cause you're R.I.P. 3 and no ones to blame
Fool, can't deal when we roll on your fucking set
Call me a threat because you know I ain't done yet
So I feel I gotta warn ya
Me and my crew kill fucking transformers
Geah, toe to toe in the middle of the street
Turn the other cheek as the Eiht commence to beat
And I really can't stand this
One more right to your fucking jaw as yo' ass hit the canvas
Now my niggas on the run stomp
As the Compton criminals, we down another punk chump
Like I said CMW don't give a fuck
Geah, listen up

Geah, back for the mutherfucking nine deuce
MC Eiht, DJ Slip in the mutherfucking house. Geah
