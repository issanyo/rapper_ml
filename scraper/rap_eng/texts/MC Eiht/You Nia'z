All the motherfuckers here nowdays on the mic

On them high sided niggas grabbing chains and whips
I'm here to whoop em' into shape
Let me [blow em' the great?]
You know the menace keep straight
With the shit I create
Its like ya' diggin' in the crates
Find an old school jam
Back down memory lane type of nigga I am
Motherfuckers like spam
So I gotta be thin
Killing the fucking virus
When they try to get in
Go run tell a friend

Couple niggas fucking up

Nowadays its a shame couple phony ass names
Now these funny motherfuckers make the crowd a game
I'm the next dance craze motherfucker like Hammer
Fuck it, I sold sacks so i'm Tony Montana
Maybe the next hard motherfucker with the grammer
Out of banging influence your wearing a bandana
Greed give me everything that I need
The real from the west so yes I proceed
We on a mission, follow the code
I'm heading to the west were the guns explode
Story been told but nobody tell it better that Eiht
So lets get 1 thing straight

Get the rap and tryna' floss
Niggas murder in the streets
Couple good niggas lost
No brained washed fairy tales, G'eah
We hustle everything everyday for sale
