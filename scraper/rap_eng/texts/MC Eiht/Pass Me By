[Verse 1: B-Real]
If I sit on the throne  I'll commit and be home
So little is known  about the high life in the zone
Started a soldier part of a new culture
Avoided the sharks ran off the vultures
The part of the country heavyhearted and hungry
A little angry, but it wasn't for money
But the money so goddamn funny
How it blinds dummies
You ain't seein' a sunny day you got a fine money
Time's money so I waste nuthin' kill it all
Break me open witness game I spill it all
And you feel it all, don't pinch you ain't sleepin'
I'm the promethazine in your drink, slow creepin'
System shut down, finger on the snooze button
Every time you come back you feel you loose somthin'
That's your soul and I got you on my [?]
Imma roll it up put it in the air like some dutchess

[MC Eiht]
Roll up
Geah, LOC I'm tryna get high
Geah don't pass me by, geah
Roll up LOC I'm tryna get high
Geah don't pass me by
Geah don't pass em by
Geah one time's gon' pass me by
Geah Blue Stamp official
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps

[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
You  don't know how the neighborhood life be
Feds shake fuckin' niggas stay greedy
I need stress free days so I smoke one
[?] on my fucking time livin' by the gun
It's just another day dawg, tryna survive
Brain dead muthafuckas no need to revive
Mind state kinda swerve for the dollar bill
Fuck it to hit me off with a refill
Now it's all necessary you buried an adversary
Could it all be real? Man roll up some mary
Geah let me focus
Money talks so some of you fools hopeless
Geah maybe the reason that it broke us
Geah you gotta take notice

If you hustle to keep it true [?]

Roll up a fat one and pass it around
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
They say money make the muthafuckin' world go
In the hood couple niggas goin' loco
On the Vegas run hoes tryna sell twat
Rap fiends sellin' tapes like a dope spot
They want yo spot
I'm thinkin' fuck not
I got that OG roll em up [?]
But the recognition muthafucka mean everything
Hate and bullshit drama, what the dollar bring
So it's now blind a muthafucka with the radio
Couple pop bottle [?] pay a hoe
Niggas lost they weight, what happened to y'all?
We in struggle everyday behind the wall
Word to my niggas from the Wu-Tang
