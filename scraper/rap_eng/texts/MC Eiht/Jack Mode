[It goes 1..2..3..]

I'm giving up nuthing
No maybe on your shit boy, I'm scheming
I'm solo, numero uno, the Eiht's fiending
Just to get my hands on your goods
Give me the slip boy you wish you could
Geah, you're kinda frightened by the Compton night stalker
When I got you by the throat you better be a fast talker
Times running out for your program
Better hide from the Compton hitman
What ch'you got in your trunk? Fool unlock it
As I put the pat down on your pockets
The neighbourhood jacker's on the creep
I bet your sounds 'll sound good in my jeep
And tell your freak to get with the program too
Or she becomes black and blue
No harm done, and I'm out before somebody can be told
Episode one of the Jack Mode

[Straight Jacking] Geah
[Straight Jacking] Wut?
[Straight Jacking]
[Straight Jacking]

I'm starving like Marvin and gots to get some mutherfucking Peso's
So I can dig out a few hoes
And who should I game on?
Another fool that has to get jacked, its the same song
Crease up the khaki's and shirt, and I'm outta here
Who the fuck got jacked, I dont really care
My money is funny and it just don't feel right
I'm tired of cavi, cause the clucks just won't bite
And now I'm on a mission to find me a sucker
And when I catch him I hope he ain't a brave mutherfucker
Give up the shit worth value
And keep your cool, fool
Strapped with the mutherfucking 380
Release the safety, and boy your gonna hate E
Another dome that must explode
Episode deuce of the Jack Mode

[Straight Jacking] geah
[Straight jacking] unh huh
[Straight jacking]...[Straight jacking]
[Straight jacking]...[Straight jacking]..[Straight jacking]

Damn I'm broke like a mutherfucker and now I'm at the point of no
Return
One more fool on my list that I must burn
Spot a girl and she's draped with the jewelry
This is Compton for life, y'all don't hear me
Stroll to her car and played like I was wit it
Half a blunt in my mouth and she asked could she hit it
Handed her the blunt as I commence to start to lean
So I could peep out the scene
Fat links around the neck by the dozen
She's giggling to much, naw don't tell me that she's buzzing
The perfect opportunity
And when she wakes up in the morning she'll be hating E
Hopped in her car and we was set with a full tank
And in my mind I'm thinking, 'bitch drive so I can gank'
Its like that, the last episode has been told
