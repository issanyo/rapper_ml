Praying that your coming home babe

Verse:
I ain't gonna lie that sentence hurt
So what now where do we stand
Were talking years, said were talking years
Do I wait around or move on with my life
Leaving visiting and I'm asking God why
Why him? Why me? Why us?
Some day it won't be this way
Until then I'll keep having faith
Someday it won't be this way
Until then i'll keep having faith

Hook:
Praying that your coming home
And trusting that God has a plan
Praying that your coming home babe
Praying that your coming home
And trusting that God has a plan
Praying that your coming home babe
