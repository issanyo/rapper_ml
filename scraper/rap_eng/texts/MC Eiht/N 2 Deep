Geah...wuttup niggas
The Compton psycho is back
In your shit for the nine-deuce
And check this out
My nigga Scarface is in the motherfuckin house
And we bout to drop some gangsta shit

[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
I guess its true what they say
When your too far gone ain't no turning back
And coming from the Compton mack that's a fuckin' fact
Livin' in the city where bitches won't
Give up the pussy for free so a nigga don't
So here's my story. Another story about a nigga
Who lives his life by the fuckin' trigga
Gotta get my serve on, nigga you don't hear me though
Throw up the hood, might blast on 5-0
First I hit the Ides and get pumped up
Now I'm rollin' in the car kinda slumped up
I pop the glove box, Then I reach the block
Then I plug your ass in the chest with the Glock
And that's how the shits get done
I guess I'm a motherfuckin' nigga on the run
But I won't let them take me alive, so I don't sleep
Cuz, geah, I'm in too deep

[Verse 2: Scarface]
In too deep, ain't no turnin back
Cock up your mutherfuckin' gauge...
Mista-Mista Scarface for the nine-deuce
Niggas pack a nine, fuck you bitch, I pack a nine too
Millimeter Ruger for you hoes who try to flex nuts
You point your shit, I pull my shit, come nigga now lets check nuts
Born a hustler, raised a hustler, never gonna stop, trick
Buck a hustler, mutherfucker boy, you better die, bitch
Found myself a buster, had the boy front me an O.Z
Fucked him out his money, worked my way up to a whole key
Now he's got some niggas trying to ball 'Face
Time to go to work, need some back, better call Eiht
Call my nigga up, kicked the fundamentals
2 way ticket 3 o'clock, continental
Eiht rolled in with the motherfuckin' task force
Bucked them hoes off, dropped him off at the airport
Niggas don't ever fuck with me
Cause I'm a nigga who plays the game for keeps
Drop you on your ass with the quickness, cause I'm in too deep

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
Geeah, the criminals is in the motherfuckin' house..
Now they got us on the run, but we tired of runnin'
Got the Glocks all cocked, let the fools keep coming
Scarface got the motherfuckin' pump under the seat
So niggas better duck or your ass is fucked, geah
The mad man with nuttin' to lose
So you better bring your strap or catch the blues
And um, or get served like a damn clucker
Sucker, or in the end be a short motherfucker
Now them one-times is all on my back and
Heard that Eiht and Scarface peeled the cap and
They wanna gaffle us up, but its a shame
Can't fade the best from Compton and the Midwest
So watch your back when the niggas step
Cuz the scene that is left is your whole families death
And fool don't sleep
Cuz sorry motherfucker, we in too deep

Geah. In your shit for the nine-deuce
MC Eiht in the motherfuckin' house, and my nigga Scarface and shit
DJ Slip in mutherfuckin house. And we killin' the shit off. Geah
