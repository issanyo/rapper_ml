Compton's lynchin mutherfuckers with a left hook
So turn the Eiht on 80 as I start to cook
As my name stays terror when you're caught in the dark
I punk bitches and kill off all scary marks
So get a puff of the bomb ass Compton shit
And watch the A double M pop in a second clip
And when I'm all finished unloading
I set the timer to 8 seconds, heads start exploding
So punk get your shit in gear
Say your prayers, your scared, as Mike brings up the rear
Now your caught in a trap and you can't escape
Made a bad mistake cause you dissed the Eiht
You broke the penalty, punk start paying
And your short, shorter then short, knowutumsaying?
So step back sorry clown, you ain't hitting
You gets no juice, cause Compton's lynchin

[Compton]..[no, please don't!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers] X2

Fools gang way, no time to play pussy
Eiht is back to attack so dont push me
Dont try to play with my rhyme you can't stand this
I'm from Compton so I dont give a fuck if you ban this
I got you trapped in a mutherfuckin straight coat
I guess you just can't talk with a clenched throat
So punk don't try to bargain with your rhymes
Playing me close will mean your crossing Eiht's line
And thats not good for your health
Cause when it comes to Eiht and Mike, you'll get dealt with
The mutherfucking power after hour
No air to breath, cause all the suckers we devour
So hang up your dreams of making snaps
You won't make a penny with your fucked up raps
So step back or its your title I'm clinching
Punk ass fool, cause Compton's lynchin

[Compton]..[no, please don't!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[Now wait a minute. Hey man]..[Now I'm lynchin
Mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[stop stop stop!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]

I guess I'll start dropping these fools, cause they lyrics be like
Offending me
So you can say that Eiht's your worste enemy
So make tracks or its your fucking hood I'll blow down
One on one in the Compton streets we'll have a showdown
And when it comes to Eiht its quite simple
Pull the trigger, bullet smacks dead in your temple
No explanations on why I did it
When they ask, I tell em cause the punk bullshitted
So now I leave his homeys in grief
I can't just stand here and trip off a sucker who got beef
And the Eiht ain't bullshitting G
I got to kill off the sucker before the sucker gets me
So raise the fuck up because the Eiht ain't tripping
Before I let a sucker slide, he's already slipping
And whats left is a sucker caught up in suspension
Word em up G, cause Compton's lynchin

[Compton]..[no, please don't!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[stop stop stop!]..[Now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]

You give up? I see your sweating like crazy
Eiht'll stay cool, cause fool you tried to phaze me
Your rhymes are washed up your beats are fucked
Your just a victim punk you'll get stuck
By a brother with a evil vengence
And when I say Eiht kills, boy I meant this
And if your caught in the crossfire its like that
I mean the shooting of lyrics or the damn gatt
And geah, Eiht is back
Teaming up with the Mike on the sneak attack
So be prepared to get gaffled in the mix
As my DJ Mike T fuck with the turntable tricks
So take flicks, cause your all on his dick
And its making me sick as he start to do a trick
So raise the fuck up, its pieces of your brain that I'm pinchin
Word em up G, Compton's lynchin

[Compton]..[oh oh oh]..[get your ass up]..[whats up nigga]..[Now I'm
Lynchin mutherfuckers]
[Compton]..[shit]..[punk ass nigga]..[now I'm lynchin mutherfuckers]
