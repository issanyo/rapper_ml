In da muthafucking house for da '94 beeitch
Kill'em all off, ya know what I'm sayin'

Niggas backdafuckup of da compton thug
When I'm gone off da muthafuckin' chronic hood nigga

Lips get split, bang this shit
Never gave a fuck about a hoodrat bitch
Clownin' in da trey with da 3-wheel switch
So stay da fuck back, you know it's like that
Come strapped with da "K", what can I say
Leave youre ass sceared like dana dane
Nightmare's we come in pairs
It don't stop to the tick tock
Around the clock, electric shock

Specialisin' in causing pain
Better yet I put fools to sleep

Droppin' the gangsta shit that you never heard
