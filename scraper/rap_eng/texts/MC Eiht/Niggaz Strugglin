Geah. Wuttup? The Compton psycho is back
Here goes something for the niggas

Listen up motherfuckers 'cause it's hard times
MC Eiht comin' back with the hard rhymes. Geah
So bring your pen and pad and start learnin'
And sit your ass down for the Eiht root sermon
You know the hard life comes with livin' in the ghetto
Nigga hello, don't be shakey like Jello
And you better know where your from
Or you might catch the blast to your sorry ass. Geah
And the gang bangin' done got me in the slum
So I gotta be with it, fuck the dumb
Down for the hood, holdin' my own
Living it up cause one day I'll be gone. Geah
Now the shit done hit the fan
14 year-old nigga headed for the can
Blame it on the world, 'cause everybody's buggin'
Can I get help because a nigga's strugglin'

17 years old, kinda crazy
Heard my little freak is pregnant with a baby
So now I gotta pay, and no time to play
Cause the motherfuckin' stork is on his way
Hey, nigga give up your shit
And don't be a hero, cause fool I ain't havin' it
One more point that got scored
Cause lettin' you slide I just can't afford. Geah
Just like cats and dogs when it rains
Another jacked is the snaps that I gain
So I rush you, quick on the blind side
Better take cover when Eiht starts to hoo-ride
Nowhere to run so you stand and fight
As I mack yo' ass once, good night
A nigga like me 'll keep muggin'
Can I get help cause a nigga strugglin'

I guess it's back to the same old shit
Grab the gat then I make another hit
Beggin' just ain't friendly
Can't get a job at motherfuckin' Wendy's
Gotta go out and test my skills
A brother gotta kill to bring home the bills
It ain't the way I was born, the way I grew up
To gets whats yours and don't even give a fuck
So nigga gimme what's mines and get on
Punk you know the routine, it's the same ass song
So don't slip fool, or get caught
Riggedy-raised in Compton was the way the Eiht was taught
Gettin' my propers, beatin' the coppers
This brother gotta have the ends I won't stop the
Puttin' in mutherfuckin' work
I gotta have the ends 'cause I'm down for the dirt
'Cause a nigga's strugglin'

Geah, that's how it go down, y'knowutumsayin?
Niggas strugglin', can't get none. Can't get over. Damn
