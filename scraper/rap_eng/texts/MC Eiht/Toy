Toy by Jonathan Hay, MC Eiht and Ranna Royce

Intro: MC Eiht
Jonathan Hay, Ranna, what’s good, it’s Compton

Chorus 1: Mike Smith and MC Eiht

I’m in love with my toy
It’s the only thing that brings me joy
Sorry to put my toy over you
Geah
Baby It’s true
Geah
I have no, no competition
It feels so good
The nigga Eiht in the building
She clowned you

Verse: MC Eiht
Geah, geah, geah, geah, geah
The best thing that I got
I’m regulating your spot
Just me and my girlfriend, my bottom bitch so hot
Jealous ones do envy, God damn I’m sprung
All day I fantasize filling up my lungs
Coughing I do often, I never leave you for them
My other broads they sweating me
Nigga, where the fuck you been?
Smell all in my clothes, all over my room
I need to hit that one mo’, don’t leave me soon
Soon as I get home, I’m putting up that chrome
Lick a little then roll up, take it straight to the dome
All day every way, geah nigga, enjoy
My girl trippin’ my weed smoke, I’m a little kid with my toy
I don’t share with my friends
I don’t spend on my ends
Ride around with you all day, ain’t no need to pretend
First choice, second place
Never that, no case
Can you be my favorite toy?
Big kid like baby boy

Chorus 2: Ranna Royce
Sugar
Honey honey
Fishnets and whiskey boy
But all he wants is his toy
Honey
Sugar sugar
Garters and brandy boy
But he just plays with his toy

Outro: Mike Smith and Ranna Royce
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
You, yes you...
La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la-ah ah ah
