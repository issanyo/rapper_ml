(Westside, in the house, for the ninteen ninety sick
Yeah, Mc Eiht in the house, Infinite Mass in the house
And this is how we represent... check it out!)

(MC Eiht)
We represent from six thousand miles away
We get our slang on, bang on, hang to the A.K
You don't wanna play, say what you say
What the _ _ _ _, Westside puts it down all day
Handle mine with the nine-mill
Clocking bills on the westside of the hill
Ain't nothing change but the scrilla'
You don't work, you don't eat
So Im nothing but the killa
Keep on sweating this Compton thang
Eiht Da Mack come strap, and high jack
And damn plane, flowing like hawking birds
You gets dub by this criminal nigga on the run
We bangs like Crips and Bloods
Straight thugs, from Comptown to Stocktown
Killing and drugs
It don't matter where you at gee
From under the fifty night to Rinkeby
We holds it down, E and the Infinite
Bought it, twenty million crowns
One two one two, check it out!

Chorus(*2)
We represent from Comptown to Stocktown
From block to block, Glocks to Glocks
All around
You fucks around and you gets no pass
It's the MC Eiht baby down with Infinite Mass

(Cham)
For the one's who's down with the Eiht hype sound
From block to block, to da last busstop in your town
I don't mean to rag, but we've gots that shit
Make weak rappers stand still, while we be spitting
Out hits
Foes get killed, everyday. And peace say may West
Cause Infinite Mass and MC eiht is like two to the chest
That's wheel, that's how I feel, I gots to be hard
Cause the world is hard, Im glad Im live, that's why I
Thank god
Standing here, in the middle of nowhere
My mind is tripping on me cause, butter's gone there
What should I do? Im stronger than I thought
Got my peeps together, and say, let's do it from the heart
Years went by, my click got tight
Pimps and hustlers on the late night hype
On the next level, that no one can fear
Cham represent from my block, to your town

Chorus(*2)
We represent from Comptown to Stocktown
From block to block, Glocks to Glocks
All around
You fucks around and you gets no pass
It's the MC Eiht baby down with Infinite Mass

(Rigo-Rod)
Foes be sayin' gees be weak, while my block not
Just squeete my homie Shelf. With the sock round his Glock
And that's how we live in the R-I-N-K-E-B-Y
The place I call home, in the Stocktown zone
And this is for all the slanging foes
From them one's locked down, to them still hanging in the hood
And nothing new, cause we been here for years
With the Mass and the Compton Psycho droping shit in your ears
And every track we makes be banging, for the ninety sick
It's from Stocktown and Compton thanging
And alot of groups out there, the lack, with the Mass
Rollin' with record-reppers, checking for fast

Chorous(*2)
We represent from Comptown to Stocktown
From block to block, Glocks to Glocks
All around
You fuck around and you gets no pass
It's the MC Eiht baby down with Infinite Mass

...Sweden is the bomb, Stockholm is the bomb
From Comptown to Stocktown, yoimsayin', it's ALL GOOD...
