Compton is the place that I touched down
I opened my eyes to realise I was dark brown
And right there in the ghetto that color costs
Brothers smothered by the streets meaning we're lost
I grew up in a place where it was go for your own
Don't get caught after dark roaming the danger zone
Cause it was hell at the age of 12
As my Compton black brothers were in and out of jail
Years went on, I played with the school crap
Made it half way, it didn't pay, so I said fuck that
Cause right then it was the cash I was after
The street had a beat so I was caught up in the rapture
It said sell, sell, sell
And after that it was jail, jail, jail
I also kept a nine as my toy
I was only 15, so boys will be boys
So by 16 I was hip to the groove
And fucking any stupid black bitch that move
And on top of that I was down for the hood
If you from Compton you know that the hood is where its good
So load up the gatts and its down the avenue
I'm kinda fucked up so I guess I'll kill a few
Punk niggas trying to scheme on my tip
Geah I'm selling the cavi and I'm checkin a grip
But now the high rolling days been cancelled
Damn, they kidnapped my homie for ransom
But thats an everyday thing thats what the news play
One times can't do shit so why the fuck do you pay
And this goes out to all those niggas that know whats popping
Fool thats when your raised in Compton

Scratching:
[he would grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum..
Either in jail, or someone would shoot him.]X2

Drug wars, you got the pushers and the pimps
And to make things worse you got the bustas and the wimps
Gank bitches trying to scheme on my money
Sucker punks jack, now ain't that funny
But I'm a young nigga, with a respectable rep
But my brothers gangbanging, I guess I'll follow in his footsteps
Claiming a set, jacking a brother
Beating a bitch, you diss the hood I'll put you 6 feet under
Who gives a fuck if its wrong, no time for thinking
Just think of the bud and the 8-ball drinking
So now its time to show my loyalty
Shoot up my enemy territory
And my brothers got my back they won't trip
And I'm in it to win it so I won't slip
It was like we had a gangbang rally
A thousand mutherfucking thuggish niggas in the alley
So while we waited to peel a cap
The suckers crept, damn, shot me in the back
So now I bail in a wheelchair, no more stomping
Raised in Compton

Geah, y'knowutumsayin?
MC Eiht and Compton's Most Wanted putting niggas to rest
Side by each, y'knowutumsaying? Putting em down
Cause Compton is the place with the base
And if you don't like it take 2 to the face
MC Eiht, and I'm outta here
