[Hook]
Anyway, forget it nigga
It's Alright
If you're standing on the corner hustle all night
Everybody trying to get it till we all tight

Anyway, forget it girl
It's Alright
If you're standing on the corner hustle all night
Everybody trying to get it till we all tight


[Verse 1]
All I try to do is stack dough
Anywhere that I can get it man, y'all don't know
I've been in this since the beginning man, check my flow
And my words gonna bring drama, boy, it's gonna show
I'm serious
Just like Steady B
Hoping I don't get caught for robbery
It's a motherfucking jungle out here all day
Shots rang out in the place I stay
And that's my word
Trying to stack, cop a bird
Being the motherfucking nigga is the word I heard
I'm on the curve
Feet up, blowing the herb
Do Not Disturb
We moved out, weighted the birds
(Hey)
You don't see no welcome mat
Niggas like bitches might turn to wraps
Play Crip niggas might change the stacks
Never mind the mic status, I'm still strapped with gats
G-yeah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Anybody get it, boy that means you
Nightmare of Compton is all true
Another nigga dead so what you gonna do?
A small fraction of what we go through
There's murder in the town, trying to put in work
Then watch out, cause jealous fools might go berserk
He see, she see, they scheme a plot
Of being a beer memory, what? Eiht gets shot
Not!
Imma shoot for the dough
And keep squeezing the trigger till my finger's sore
You'll be another victim who fucked with colors he wore
You'll be the first dead nigga on my reality show
Gangsta with no calls
And I could run through the clips with no faults
And sometimes that means life behind bars
Finally dumb lady young hero's stars
You get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Street Life got me oh so hooked
Get what I split or get your shit took
Don't look, Imma say fuck the math
And let me finish my task, no questions asked
Niggas still struggling, niggas get mine
At any given time, so I keeps the nine
One time, with the flashlight, trying to shine
Loaded, motherfucker's way out of line
I'm a borderline psycho, I ain't like no
Other motherfucker with an AK Rifle
The bitches say "You so trifling Eiht!
But I still want you to fuck me, and I can't wait."
Late Night, the domestic fight
The neighbors call the cops and I take flight
You nosy motherfuckers know that ain't right
Hope I cross your path, get it down on sight
G-yeah!

[Hook]
