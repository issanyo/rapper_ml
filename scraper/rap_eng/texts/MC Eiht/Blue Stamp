Gyeah, Blue Stamp official
Keep it Compton

[Verse one: MC Eiht]
Gyeah, Eiht kid to shut 'em down, ghetto'll be the pro now
Love it cause it’s underground
Just like the shot lights, tell me how you seen
The hoes with the pretty face, ass extreme
Dreams of fucking a celebrity, gyeah
Stuck up in the ass, but them love hood did
Gyeah, you know the motton, hennesy bottle
In the lap, right next to the strap, the homies follow
Ghetto, gyeah so infamous, screaming innocence, with the evidence
Gyeah, fight for the young and mean I represent
Shady promoters, niggas grown ever since
Long as the beat keep banging, niggas come
The hoes sing every word, feel good, ha
That’s what a motherfucker bring
You stamped official, so let the shit bring

[Hook]
Get yours, niggas I get mine
And everything is fine, and give it the blue stamp
Get yours, niggas I get mine
We on push the line, and give it the blue stamp
Get yours, niggas I get mine
We run from one time, and give it the blue stamp
Niggas, gyeah, rep your town
Bitches, gyeah, rep your town

[Verse two: MC Eiht]
You’re a customer, so the product ride
So every fucking thang gonna be so tight, alright
Soon the elite go to business vary
Fight for the neighborhood, I’m a missionary
Wake up everybody, we back in the place
Some real niggas and bitches invade your space
Give a fuck where you from, homes store up your fingers
A new ghetto tone for your salary ringers
Tryna bring back the sound that you missing bad
Get rid of these phoney motherfuckers drinks and fats
Eiht got your medicines (Yes)
Bomb, my bomb niggas all in (Fuck with me)
Some niggas loyalty is only skin deep
We straight from the street, so they talk it don’t speak
I say your name so weak, it’s Compton everyday
I rep it in my sleep, c'mon

[Hook]
Get yours, niggas I get mine
And everything is fine, and give it the blue stamp
Get yours, niggas I get mine
We on push the line, and give it the blue stamp
Get yours, niggas I get mine
We run from one time, so I give it the blue stamp
Niggas, rep your town
Bitches, rep your town

[Verse three: MC Eiht]
Niggas from the hood, so it’s guarantee west
It’s where a nigga headed, so the brain don’t rest
It’s no competition, the amateurs don’t impress
It’s money over hoes, you trick you don’t mess
Gangsta, gangsta, heard all about
The only nigga’s back in town runnin' her mouth
Tryna smoke a couple palm trees
Niggas banging impala music
You know them OG’s
Compton, niggas where your dues pay
Sliding in my ride, house shoes, sippin kool-aid
Who you wanna fade, Compton original
Fuck it, this the west nigga, any individual
Bump a couple towns now, send the residuals
Want the real west coast, nigga here it goes
Nigga make it sound so clear
The drive-by music so good in your ear, c'mon

[Hook]
Get yours, niggas I get mine
And everything is fine, and give it the blue stamp
Get yours, niggas I get mine
We on push the line, and give it the blue stamp
Get yours, niggas I get mine
We run from one time, so I give it the blue stamp (gyeah)
Niggas, rep your town (gyeah-gyeah)
Bitches, (rep your town) and that's official, gyeah

Who's step in the building?
