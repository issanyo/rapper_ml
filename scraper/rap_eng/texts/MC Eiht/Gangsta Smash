[Hook x2]

Up in the club, they shaking ass
Beef in the spot, we put it at blast
Blunts, rolled, I pull out the stash
This is the way we gangsta smash

[Verse 1]

Lean, yo. Weed, blow
Switches we bouncing it low-low
Compton hip, we fucking dope
W shown out the window
Enemies know what they in fo'
Cops try to gather that info-
-mation. Frustration
Who in the fuck left these shell cases?
Drive-by, hood rich
Real gangstas won't talk and don't snitch
Gang-banging niggas who won't switch
Live by the model and trust no bitch
Get your papers
Beaten so they can'st evade us
On it we know it's the fucking best
To d-day we die so fuck the rest
If you got beef get that shit off your chest
Open your brain in your bulletproof vest
Compton, the city, we standing tall
Gang raw phone call

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]

Hood rats, gang tats
Dope trying to stash under car mats
Police asking where the guns at?
Jack and boy you better lay flat
One stab, jump in and pop
Breath in real hard as you duck from the cops
Fleeing the scene or the evidence drops?
Keep making moves, avoiding the stops
Tired from all the fences you hop?
Get away clean and you setting up shop
Either stay or transform
Slip and homeboy you be heading to court
Telling your niggas to hold down the fort
Send them some flicks and a little support
Stressed out, stretched out
You know what county jail life's all about

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]

Gang man, strap in hand
Money is made on the corners we stand
Money is wrapped with the rubber band
Shoot them up when enemies roll in
Gun spark, car crash
Mission complete, so collect the cash
No need to floss, so build up your stash
Hiding my face, the cameras flash
Top notch, grab your crotch
Now the block trying to form neighborhood watch
They gonna keep hating the way that I am
Keep shooting and hoping my guns don't jam
Who dipping again? We don't give a fuck
It's like in the hood, homeboy, we stuck
Until the day we come up
Keep to drinking my cup
