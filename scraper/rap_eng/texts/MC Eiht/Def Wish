Geah. The MC Eiht's in the mutherfuckin house y'knowutumsayin?
The Compton maniac
Here to break your ass something off real proper, y'knowutumsayin?
Damn!

Suckers, I go for broke so dont choke on the smoke
Cause if I hit the chronic, Eiht starts the rap bionic
So enough with that punk shit
With your fucked up lyrics you can't shoot the gift
Like it should be shot
Gots no hearts, punk ass marks, dont start you'll get got
And at the end of the trail is whats left
Is a sucker mutherfucker who done simped to death
So if ya got static go and gather up your army
You'll be a short ass punk trying to harm me
I bet you sorry MC's never seen this
A sucker punk hung up by his penis
So watch out for a sucker on the gank
Cause while Compton's Lynchin, I'm taking money to the bank
And its the MC Eiht on your shit list
Commence to killing you off you gots your def wish

[I'll make you famous...]
[Now when I go for my gun...you can start shooting]

Phase 2, Its the brother who be taxing
Running over punks like my brother Bo Jackson
As your card's on freeze frame your chicken
It's the Eiht double M and I'll keep sticking
All that pay back shit is in effect
Cause I'm the type a brother who'll blast your ass, check
So if your biting my lyrics, then fool you'll pay
As you commence to say em you'll get tooth decay
So give up to the Compton psycho
Biting me Quik will mean you get the duck sick quick
Not a funny man, but still I gives surprises
Lyrics are deadly plagues, the death toll rises
So now your shit outta luck with your rhyme scheme
And now I hunt your punk ass in your bad dreams
Another victory on my list
One more punk ass fool with a def wish

Chorus

Now say your prayers, because its difficult to get with this
I'll haunt your studio, become your ghost lyricist
No mistakes I make, so don't fake
Yous as sorry as fuck, so jump your ass out a cake
Dont try to bargain with the maniac mistro
On the stage I'm in a rage with a gangsta show
The Capital E, The Capital I, the Capital H
The Capital T, down MC
Mike T is the partner down with me
Suckers got static, here goes the G-A-T
So take a step up and play for the rhythm
]From Compton boy, and this is what I give em
A blast from the gat just for talking that junk
Feel like handling the business might smoke the punk
I run the nine one, fool, so get hip to my ways
And don't be no hero like in the western days
At sundown, you'll press your luck and try to shoot me
Grab your davey Crocket, I'll grab my gangsta Uzi
And after all that, you'll still be R.I.P
If you fuck with me...Fool theres your def wish

Geah, y'knowutumsayin? MC Eiht stepping to the mutherfuckin 91
My DJ mike T's in the mutherfuckin house
Down with the DJ Bolo, and Unknown. Geeeaaah
