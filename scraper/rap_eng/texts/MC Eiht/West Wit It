[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
Smoke in the air from a gunshot
Bitches getting hi off a good pot
Blocks stay hot, scraps in the spot
One time profile if you like it or not
But on to the next episode
Compton stick it to the G-code
Light sound at the spot explode…
Real west, how the track get rolled
And we just here to smoke a tray
And fuck a few ho’s, get money in the bank
Take a right turn down the boulevard
OG niggas in the front yard
Bitches in the block, make a bank roll
[?]
You wanna land [?]
All eyes, all eyes on the front, no back (geah)

[Chorus: MC Eiht & G Wylx]
This is how the fuck we did it
(Geah) West wit it!
Scream it so you don’t forget it
(Geah) West wit it!
This is how the fuck we did it
(Geah) West wit it!
Scream it so you don’t forget it
(Geah) West wit it!
(Geah) West wit it!
(Geah) And that’s official

[Interlude: G Wylx & MC Eiht]
Your brother G on the mic
Blue stamp in the building
We bouncin’

[Verse 2: G Wylx]
I smell OG in the air (Wessiiiide)
Homegrown, never care what you care
Who’s that nigga on the corner Red Square
A type o player cutting any mayor in layers
We claim our rights for the AKs
We make them for the purpose of gun blaze
No breaks like we never-ending street race
I spit your face and then treat you with my pancakes
West nigga to the left from the Urals
When they think of me they use only plurals
Unstoppable like Banksy with murals
Five O’s bring me straight to the bureaus
Reefer smoke on plush leather seats, spraying
Seeds, only purest, you receive no receipts
To the fullest we provide for the streets
A desease that be spreading worldwide in a twist
Coming to you live and direct from the place
Where my gun stay erect, it’s a fact (full effect)
Even when you take a nap in the bed
I’m a vet smoking on wet cigarette

[Chorus: G Wylx & MC Eiht]
This is how the fuck we did it
(Geah) West wit it!
Scream it so you don’t forget it
(Geah) West wit it!
This is how the fuck we did it
(Geah) West wit it!
Scream it so you don’t forget it
(Geah) West wit it!
This is how the fuck we did it
(Geah) West wit it!
Scream it so you don’t forget it
(Geah) West wit it!
This is how the fuck we did it
(Geah) West wit it!
Scream it so you don’t forget it
(Geah) West wit it!

[Outro: MC Eiht & G Wylx]
A to the K what we say (geah)
West nigga, do it all day (geah)
A to the K what we say (geah)
West nigga, do it all day (geah)
Wessiiiide!
Bluestamp official
And it’s official
