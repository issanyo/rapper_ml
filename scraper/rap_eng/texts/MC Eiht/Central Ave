[Intro]
Riding down muthafuckin’ Central Avenue
Riding down muthafuckin’ Central Avenue
Hoping the police don’t gaffle you
I’m talking Central Avenue…Central Avenue…Central Avenue

[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
I used to ride the back of the bus like Rosa Parks
Down the mainline shouting hood remarks
(Ay, ay, where you from, nigga?)
‘Where you from, homeboy? Compton on mine’
Get ‘em up one time, gafflin’ fine
Deuce-deuce in the stash, that’s how BGs smash
Eight niggas on the block all hustle for cash
If I die tonight, hope I go out dumpin’
You only live once, I ain’t dying for nothin’
That’s the streets nowadays, young guns and strays
Another sip on the cup, niggas lost and dazed, jeah

[Bridge]
Henny in my lap, I’m so loaded
Hit the gas, hit the gas, we no slowin’
Goal in mind, goal in mind, niggas find you, yeah
If they do, they will leave no evidence
Goal in mind, goal in mind, niggas find you, yeah
If they do, it go down on Central Ave, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
I try to inspire niggas, but I got pills in my trunk
These niggas higher than hawk’s nests
They get low when the dump
I pay my bill on Santa Fe, yo, that’s Pacific Bell hustle
Even before AT&T, we shoebox money, short muzzle
If you know Barclay and Alondra, then that’s MC Eiht
And you know Spruce and Aranbe, yo, that’s that Quik and we great
Now…
