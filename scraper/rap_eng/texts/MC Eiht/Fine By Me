[Intro]: (MC Eiht)
One! Two! (Yeah!) One! Two! Three! Four! (Blue Stack, Year Round)

[Verse One: MC Eiht]
I reminisced like Mary J. and I Just Blazed
Fuck Mary Jane got me caught in a daze
Back in the drive by days relaxed
We hustle from we make the fuckin greenery stacks
Tracks from my tears, blood sweatin for years
Niggas was bangin soon switched careers
Dear mama, forgive me for, what I say
I'm a victim of the ghetto I was born this way
I ain't worried 'bout the others tryin to step on toes
Motherfuckers need hope yeah I supposed
My life is straight from the bottom call me gutter man
I live my life in the street, fuck a better plan
Niggas stand up, hoes hold yo' head
We don't give a fuck how a nigga get bread
Unless your tryin to break me off a piece
I let the fo' fo' go, now your ass deceased
Yeah!

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (MC Eiht)
The-The world knew I had to come once mo', and just to let y'all know ("Dr. Dre")
(Yeah! It's fine by me)
The-The world knew I had to come once mo', and just to let y'all know ("Dr. Dre")
(Blues down, Year Round, Yeah)
(Your from the streets? It's fine by me, anyway ya eat, It's fine by me)
The-The world knew I had to come once mo', and just to let y'all know ("Dr. Dre")

[Verse Two: MC Eiht]
Come on! I must hypnotize the mind like I was Three 6
Money over hoes yeah we know tricks (We know tricks)
If ya got it nigga keep it in ya stash
So you could make bail when the one time smash
Crash still hittin our blocks lookin for gangs
Everybody heard when the gunshots bang
Money exchangce, niggas inherit slang
From the West, It's a motherfuckin Compton thang
I'm a bang 'til they got down pimp 'em like hoes
Get the checkin on they income that's how it goes
Somebody caught the blues niggas ran out of shoes
Some take it personal don't follow the rules
No clues when they wanna investigate
Niggas cool 'cause we try to keep food in our plate (Food on our plate)
Pull up, tryin to push that weight
It's not rhymes but It's hundred from the gate!
Yeah!

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (MC Eiht)
The-The world knew I had to come once mo', and just to let y'all know ("Dr. Dre")
It's fine by me, anyway ya eat homeboy It's fine by me)
And just to let y'all know ("Dr. Dre") (Yeah, Yeah, Ye-Ye-Yeah! Yeah!)
(Your from the streets? It's fine by me, Blues Down, It's fine by me)
(Year Round! Premo! Let me get at 'em! Get at 'em!

[Verse Three: MC Eiht]
Try to fuck with it but the lines authentic
Checks get cashed but we keep it independent
My niggas Scarface, Tony!
Money and the power and ya stay O.G'd
You niggas owe me keep bitin my words
Keep it on the down low so ya don't disturb
Couple of niggas watchin, why they stare?!
It's all for the income low I swear
By the code of the streets It's no tattle
Caught up in another gun battle
Only the strong survive
It's nothin but the hood shit when I arrive
Motherfuckers keep lookin with they eyes wide shut
Freeze let the one time give that up
FREEZE!!! (*Police Siren) 'fore the next episode
Is the niggas jump out and the straps unload
Yeah!

[Chorus: DJ Premier Scratchin] (MC Eiht)
The-The world knew I had to come once mo', and just to let y'all know ("Dr. Dre")
(It's fine by me)
The-The world knew I had to come once mo', and just to let y'all know ("Dr. Dre")
( Ye-Ye-Ye-Yeah! Ye-Ye-Ye-Yeah!)
(Your from the streets homey? It's fine by me, anyway ya eat homey, It's fine by me)
The-The world knew I had to come once mo', and just to let y'all know ("Dr. Dre")
