Rap   version  .....

Yes how come
With much century still life getting worst
Worst than ever, worst than ever 
Hommies they life not easy 
Killing the young is like a pride for some
See the young generations dying off silently
War spread around the places , millions of children dying for sake of political reasons .. ( how come )
The life is mistress , the life getting worst
Placing so many families into pains and suffering 
How come
So many children are homeless 
So many children are losing there future for war 
How come, how come
Every year there is war taking place in Africa
How come every year there is a fight in the middle east 
More refugees spreading around the century 
HOW COME
Hoping out for peace , still no year for peace
Stop the fire that is burning in Africa 
Africa you are the father of civilization
Am Dareysteel a.k.a. crying loud for changes
With much struggling we still dying hard to survive
Cos all i see is pain with sorrow 
Every year with war spread around they future
( how come )
How come is the message , how message
Is the message from they people....


Chorus .... version


So many children dying 
So many children dying 
So many children homeless 
How come, how come, uuuuuuuhhh
So many children dying 
So many children dying 
So many children homeless 
How come, how come, uuuuuun
I have been round the world, have been round the world
Have been round the world, have been round the world
I have been round the world, have been round the world, how come , how come , how come
I have been round the world, have been round the world
Have been round the world, have been round the world
How come, how come
