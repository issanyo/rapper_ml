CHORUS....

Anywhere you go
I will follow you, follow you
Wherever you go
I will follow you, follow you

Anywhere you go
I will follow you, follow you
Wherever you go
I will follow you, follow yo

RAP....


Come back, come back
Pretty, little, sexy girl
Pretty, looking, sexy
I will follow you
Follow you, ooh
Anywhere you go
Every, every, place you go
Nothing gonna,stop me
Loving you, loving you
Girl, I will follow you
I will, I will, follow you
Jah is my witness
Heaven is my witness
Twelve in the midnight
I will, I will, follow you
Remember how we use to cruse
The city, in the old times days
How we use to make love
How we use to share love
How you use to hold me
How you use to kiss me
From the orther side
Why you wanna break up
You wanna break up, that is bullshit
Another thing
Is losing you to another guy
Tell me why you wanna go
Baby why you wanna go girl
Am addicted, baby am addicted
Can't live without you
Can't live without you
Girl...

CHORUS....

Anywhere you go
I will follow you, follow you
Wherever you go
I will follow you, follow you

Anywhere you go
I will follow you, follow you
Wherever you go
I will follow you, follow you

Repit  ...
Fade...
