[Chorus:]
I know this shit get kinda crazy
When you be out in the streets
I used to roll strap with the Glock in my lap
Homies in the wheel with the seats leaned back
I reminisce on the good times
I reminisce on the bad
I used to roll through like I ran that shit
See my name now I home that bitch

[Verse 1:]
Talking rubers ducking troopers
Run around with shooters
Homicide on them shooters
Stuff a OG in the hookahs
Niggas slanging bitches hanging
Trickers banging getting Louis in the ruber
Younger niggas with the cougars
I let her go to the head like go down but slow down
Brand new bust then I send her right back in the Uber
Back to party eating fry calamari little reese and bob marley
Vroom vroom on the holly, mommy’s a rider
She pull up A&G Im in the Aston right beside her
You’s a sucker nigga, keep quiet I let em holla
My boy ride shotgun with a chopper and revolver
Ready rock prada anything to get a dollar
Nigga yellow caution tape crime no white collar
Fuck em all, standing tall just like towers
Got the power nigga long as money hit the block cowards (Motherfuckers)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Hennessy, twisting and reminiscing
Rock the mic too when C had me on the mission
Was a late night run around with Beenie
All through the city dark shotties and barcelonie
Had my toothpick, young and fly on that cool shit
Knew it wouldn't be long before [?] trip
Blakka, blakka nigga wipe that chrome down
It's all good nigga cause my big bro home now
In the trenches where they stick syringes
Coppers can we hop the fences boy this shit is illest
Take a scoobie, smoke a reggie and roll a doobie
Now as a silent make a movie with your favorite groupie
Tell her pay selling pays, heller haze
Step out the cleaners take a chalk its teller may
We live it up, champagne we sip it up
Hey nigga from we hit em up get your bitches plucked

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Used to hit the block young then I started slangin in that motherfucker
(ooh I got that roll)
Shotgun with a drum hanging from that motherfucker
(Ooh we all get plugged)
Waiting for my big br to max out, smoke till we pass out
Drinking till the song go host what they ask out
Hit em then we mash out
Nigga we don't love em
We just take em to the telie then we fuck em
All of em it's all down

[Chorus]
