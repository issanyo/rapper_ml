[Hook - Meek Mill]
I got my x bitch fucking with my next bitch [x3]
You ain't fucking ho? cool, that's the exit
I got my x bitch fucking with my next bitch
I got my next bitch fucking with my best bitch
I got my x bitch fucking with my x bitch
You ain't fucking ho? cool, that's the exit

[Verse 1 - Young Chris]
Caught my x bitch fucking with my next bitch
She a bad little bitch, thick as Texas
She a down bitch, why I fucks with her
Got a pretty little bitch going up with her
Live, it's Benz in the garages
Got a bad bitch named Nicki that love Minajs
What's the deal huh? fuck with a real one
Tell 'em activist I need a silk one
Now I got my x girl fucking with my next girl
All that equals bomb ass pussy and the best twirl
Best of the both worlds, want that R.Kelly chicken shit
Gotta love a bad bitch that hit a bitch
She the best

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Meek Mill]
I got my x bitch fucking with my next bitch
I got my next bitch fucking with my best bitch
I put em all in the ring like wrestling
Then send em home to their boyfriend, getting questioned
Now he's stressing, look at me flexing
Catching hoes all in the field like D.Jackson
Catch a ho all on your grill if he ratting
For talking when you not in the game like John Madden
Bye bye ass, drive by past you
See you with my ho, I just ride by laughing (Ha!)
I be in that top line fashion
And I connect hoes like Wifi, ask em

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Young Chris]
Hitter, hitter, how I did her, did her
Then her best friend came in with her
I cannot forget her, gotta love the hoes
Them hoes love a nigga (What?)
Keep em on they toes, on my dime XC
Cold motherfucker, you rolling with your boy
Or you rolling with the suckers
Welcome to the house party ho, it's x rated
You ain't even know my [?] and my x dated
He the man with the hoes

[Hook]
