[Chorus]
Shorty stay by my side but I don't love her though
She know I keep it real so she play the role
Whatever isn't said; already understood
Let's see how long it last, baby, show me you
When I was in the kitchen, I was selling dope
And now she roll my loud, and it's burning slow
Shorty stay by my side but I don't love her though
Let's see how long it last, baby, show me you

[Verse 1: Rediroc]
I ain't gotta lie to kick it, I just kick it, it's Redi
Is you kidding? this Redi, that nigga
Cruising all through your city, sliding up on your women
Feeding her shots of liquor and sliding all in her kitten
I'm a dog, I love her with my mind, not my heart
Money was on my mind from the start
They say I be breaking hearts, I just keep it 100
Every since the beginning, that's why 100s of them love it
Yes love, pay attention what I'm telling you
What good is all the talk if he ain't showing you?
That's wasting time
I ain't got time for that, but I got time for dinner
At the table like "Bring me steak and lobster back"
This is all facts, my bitch is all that
Celine Bag with the sneaks to match
Tell me where we meeting at
What's a meeting for? Hope it's bout money on a marathon
Trying to get a 100, I'm Redi

[Chorus]
Shorty stay by my side but I don't love her though
She know I keep it real so she play the role
Whatever isn't said; already understood
Let's see how long it last, baby, show me you
When I was in the kitchen, I was selling dope
And now she roll my loud, and it's burning slow
Shorty stay by my side but I don't love her though
Let's see how long it last, baby, show me you

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
Running round with a big Desi
Michelle (?) on my arm, baby; big Bezi
Keep a little Peggy for little Debbie
Still my waist is a little heavy; deadly
Hey baby, it's your world, Rihanna bad; no more good girl
I pop up to a good twirl, wake up in it
Even with the Magnum on, I don't stay up in it
You kidding?
Park Benches, the Barcelini a long trenches
So vicious, she (?) before she come to her senses
If she's a keeper, I keep her walking in 6 inches
Riding in Benz's with the cat eyes, big lenses
We at the SoHo, at the Trump top; floor seats
And hit Jay up for the Barklay floor seats
Long list, see you after the cut if you make it
Opportunity is yours baby, take it
Believe it

[Chorus]
Shorty stay by my side but I don't love her though
She know I keep it real so she play the role
Whatever isn't said; already understood
Let's see how long it last, baby, show me you
When I was in the kitchen, I was selling dope
And now she roll my loud, and it's burning slow
Shorty stay by my side but I don't love her though
Let's see how long it last, baby, show me you
