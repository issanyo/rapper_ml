[Verse 1:Beanie sigel]
It's like I got a death wish, but niggas can't kill me
Live my long these real niggas gotta feel me
The media, they ridicule me
Heartless is how they really fez
Wanna prosecute me till I'm living in the cell
Or I rot in hell
Will I die in these streets only time will tell
Until then I pop pills, sip my purple
Spread love, money and guns throughout my circle
Make the ass out the feds every case I beat
Middle finger to the law nigga fuck police
For my niggas over the wall who they won't let free
And all the soldier that we've lost, may they rest in peace
Tell your mother who's alive, who said crime don't pay
Nigga fuck how you get it homie find your way
Young bucks keep your guns pulled enemies closer
Smile, look death in his eyes

[Hook:young chris]
Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ...shot...no ...raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block
Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ... shot...no ...raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block

[Verse 2:Beanie siegel]
The ghetto cold, the block hot
Niggas talking, nosy neighbors and everything
But a coffin, the hood filled with dope fiends and street walkers
Babies crying, hop signs, dogs barking
Crime scene, yellow tape, the street chalking
Bloody sheet cover the face of the departed
The blood drop and then she hardens
Cops celebrate the ...gun, this often
Young bitch 14 6 months pregnant
Sell her body on the corner, smoke weed on a regular
Get a pimp off her money, dope man he was...
Last week raped twice forced abortions
It's the life that I'm living ghetto that I'm lost in
And I'mma be here till they put me in the coffin
Feeling like pac live and die in phillie
And I'm riding till these niggas come and kill me

[Hook:young chris]
Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ...shot...no ...raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block
Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ... shot...no ...raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block

[Verse 3:beanie siegel]
My crystal popping on politicians and scooping watching
Pop a ... on who you blaming on cops lock them
A jail cell can't rehabilitate a nigga
They raise your bell and give a crack dealer life sentence
Turn around and give a pedal to the floor till you fall
That's why a prison door, over a revolving door
3 hots and a ... it's all we got, ...for big and pac

[Verse 4:Game]
Who ever knew when that child was born
He'd be Barack
44th president to be black, you gotta deal with that
Confess that I heard were crack, we gotta deal with that
Wonder why we put in the bags and tote steel with that
See a phantom like beans I kill for that
Hood nigga going rich, now I got a mill for that
Law suit she's bringing, swear I've been through
With paying nigga in full, it's getting shot through his fuel
Known thug, since my brother got killed in cold blood
So would I avenge his death, so would I sell drugs
Promised to be a real nigga to the death of me
Bury my casket to the block with the rest of me
And let my headstone really was a father
Any nigga that thought he went hard, I went harder
So state out my bindess and off my mind
I take a shot to the downfall, I'm on my grind

[Hook:young chris]
Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ...shot...no ...raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block
Where I'm from it's dangerous
It's dangerous, every day, every day
Cops ... shot...no ...raised in the ghetto
I'm just a product of the block
