[Verse 1]
Everyday is Freddy Gray, Mike Brown's in Nicetown
Trayvon's in the daytime before you take mine
Spend a dawg need pedigree for the kennel
No degree from Temple no pad without a pencil
It's mental
Gotta keep some utensils, get gangsta niggas'll test you
When you keep it too gentle
Sacrifice half my life
Down the middle with the splits
Bullets I was bitin' all I did most of the writin'
I swear you niggas is trifling
Tears blood and sweat I'm fightin'
They tryna Don King ya Tyson
Culinary grams like Aunt Jemima
Only time you seen grams cook was aunty mama
Ya'll niggas is anti drama
Ain't really into that stop confusin' the internet
A bunch of weirdos and dodgin' into hoe shit
Lost in the social the bosses scared to be vocal
A whole circle of yes men they insecure what I'm guessing
Long as the string attached its another puppet that's stressin
Fools is dizzy caught up in 360s
Spend it on busdowns blow it on V twizzys
See you chumps sittin pretty too
Like pull up combat mack 11 with the titties that's a hundred
Each drum got 50
Let it sing like Drizzy
On everybody catchin' bodies like Nicki
We gettin' busy nigga

[Verse 2]
For all the lost soldiers fuck all the niggas that crossed over
Like ya dawgs over
Hope's high, thoughts sober
Added a S to my pain
To complain I went to Spain
I want the coke I got the caine
I want the dough ya'll got the fame
I whip this coke here dope fiend jackets out the lane
I caught the end of the illest era, me and these rappers not the same
Disrespectful ass kids using my name
I'm the same Gunna before they came
Fuck boy know nothin' about that rush clown
Get a different feeling when it touchdown
Back in the end zone got a bitch that let me send home
I wanna fuck her but she a hustla keep it friend zone
Niggas plottin I keep the tints on
My niggas just waitin' when it's sunny to bring the trench home
Thirsty ass niggas'll wet ya get your quench on
Leavin' them trenches if you niggas movin a inch wrong
See Flintstone full of you Barney Rubbles
Fruitcakes dressin' up like couples
Dressin' up like chicks and ya'll call it a drip
Fuckin' gimps ya'll should fall off a cliff
I hope ya coffin'll dip
Come equip yeah my arsenal thick
Young Carson in the pocket tryna toss em in his noggin'
When that money on they head got a clip to deposit
Get them sticks out the closet
Work them shits out and chop it

[Outro]
Get the money don't let it go to ya head
Get the pussy don't let it go to ya big
You fuckin wit them bitches gettin' head goin raw
They gon leave ya to them niggas get ya head blown off
I done got my street shit need my other money up
Want that overseas shit need my colored money up
Makin sure my mom cool get my brother money up
Makin sure my sis cool help my niece get through school
Put my daughter in college get my nephew that knowledge
Give the best to my son baby boy you the one uh
Yeah
