[Intro:]
Cannon Cannon
We can do this all night
Network, ride wid a real one
Watch this
It's way better when you fucking wid a real nigga

[Verse 1:]
Top down shoes on
Oh girl that boy so cold without his jewels on
Put them bad and shoes on hop in with that roof gone
Beach body your boutique baby tryna hop in is that pool warm ?
Froll up and froll out, I bring them hoes out
I make them D-boys bring them B-rose out
Girl I got that Dope D, I get that pole out
I know you don't know me but still you shouldn't hold

[Chorus:]
Hey there was the hold up
Even though I barely know you
I think we should leave together
Hope you got something to roll up
They say I got that dope D they call me Awonyola
And my money don't fold up so what you waiting for love
And I been buying bitches drinks all night, all night
I know you wanna do it, so you should fuck a nigga good
And you been grinding up on me, all night all night
And I could tell you wanna do it do it
So you should fuck a nigga good
It's way better when you fucking wid a real one

[Verse 2:]
Turn the lights on
I say we should roll up I say we should roll out
Go somewhere and Bartend and tomorrow bust them doors out
Baby fuck with a real one get away from them fake
I got a lot a Euros let's get away from the states
We come out and show out please don't let your hoe out
You know we gon go in pour that camel toe out
Baby come and fuck wid us is you tryin to fuck or what
Few drinks bust it up to the crib busting up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now we at the club hot designers on the label
See the sparkles on the bottles see the models at the tables
Say it's like that everytime niggas come around
Ri Ri, Yeezy, Jay hoe we run the town
Got get the Phantoms, Rari, Audis and we out hea
It's Beyonce you niggas tryna get me bodied
Hoe a got a roll in ma pocket

Fuck with a real  nigga he won't know nothin bout it

[Chorus]
