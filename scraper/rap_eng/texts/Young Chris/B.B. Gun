They want me up north, stressing with them White niggas
Getting husky, fuck it let twelve judge me

Money over bitches what this SP gang about
Bought it like brotha man gas like son of Sam
One through your face leave your stretched like a rubber band
You wouldn't understand you don't want it fam
The MC with the hammer have yall niggas do the running man
Born in the ghetto straight form the projects
Game like LeBron James but no Nike contract
Pitbull red nose six hundred all gold marshland all froze
Low top red holes red shoe strings no socks on
Mr. Matinee be moving that popcorn
Yall niggas should stop drawing your oil paintings stink
While we in the kitchen cookin oils till they stink
