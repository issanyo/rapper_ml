(Intro)
Type of Shit I Like to pull up to
Pull up like skrrr
Whut up niggas
Drop that bag off
See my team eating and yall team sleep
So all that get money shit yall talk about Betta Stop

(Verse 1 - Young Chris)
Been High since I came in the game that purple rain flow
Tired of school bustin some 30's
Hiding my pain though
Paper stack like cake yo
Back in the trenches tryin to creep up on some bankroll
Same clothes till there's big faces and my chain go blang mo'
Niggas pillow talkin with the same hoes
Same ol' devious creature that Peen dating
I seen her out with meek and Deen she dream chasin
Betta stop (uh)
Better throw up
For the rainy days that fast money slow up
And the feel when they try to tag your toe up
We drinkin straight we dont ever pour up
Niggas sleep on them blow ups till we blow up
Niggas stop cereal for lunch
Cold cuts or dinner
Forgive me lord im a sinner
Smoke marajana for breakfast
This game tryin to depress us
Closest to the closer famoso for the closure
Good morning niggas

(Break)

(Verse 2 - Young Chris)
Pimps up hoes down ten toes down mo' work and more pounds
Niggas better go or pay ya hear that knock early a.m. the federals are there
I ain't scared im just smokin eatin edibles in here
Homies did a nuff time pray I never go through there
Know you feel if your family for time to go through years and get left hanging
Fake homie I thought you cared
No tears young jizzle
Seen it all taught to load a muppet every month to clean em off
Pirex's up in the kitchen show you you how to fry up a pigeon
They couldn't see my vision had to switch up on a mission had to stop
Shake the blocks switch up the rock all in a day it changed balin with Jay and Dame
I said fuck it cut off the luggage and the way of things
Killem later fuck the haters its the players game welcome to the fame niggas

(Interude)

(Verse 3 - Young Chris)
Betta stop nigga think about what you doin before them boy start shooting pack 33's
Like you ain't got everything for the low a couple bitches that fluent
The black mask when i do em cause pussy niggas be suen betta stop
Look and think about who you roll with
Before them cops be knowin about them shots we thrownin
From prison picking your body that vortex in your toe and
You payin taxes for life till them gansta naggas you owe 'em
Betta stop
Who you think goin to get caught in that rain though heard you niggas is pussy they ain't snorting cocain smoking weed from the derb  painkillers for the pain more pain from the flow
Champagne for the bros
