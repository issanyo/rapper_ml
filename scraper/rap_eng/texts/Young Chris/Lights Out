[Intro:]
You know the motto
Rich niggas ride out
Wealthy niggas fly out [ain't no game]
You broke ass niggas continue to walk it out

[Verse 1:]
Started with a pack had to hustle that nigga need to get a new ride
Papa neva there he was a rolling stone mama had to work 2 jobs
24/7 tryna dodge police living like a savage out in these streets
Homie hit me up said he got a new Jack
Now we plotting on the nigga with a new piece
Living like Thor tryna get ourself up
Young outlaws not giving a fuck
Running through these streets tryna get us some rolls
Tryna get us some hoes tryna get a sitting up
Running round wilding thief and strap down
Time to get revenge well i'm where they at now
Got a few niggas on ma list gotta got to the death
Ya'll pussy ass niggas gotta know
Won't rest till [?]

[Chorus:]
Spirit of a hustler
Some people love you some don't trust you
Never folding under pressure always got to keep it fresher
Spirit of a hustler
Some people love you some don't trust you
Never folding under pressure always got to
You got to keep it fresher
This here is the final countdown
Turning your lights out, turning your lights out
Turning your lights out

[Verse 2:]
Pull a few triggers we shooting shit up
Running wid a few niggas that don't give a fuck
When they pull out them choppers they chopping shit down
When they spray your ass down bitch ain't no getting up
Here to get revenge man, here to do it for ma friends man
Ain't a whole lot a rapper just some shit they gotta have
And God forgive me for ma sins man
On site ya'll bitch ass niggas buckle up
I got a snitch then all ma bitch double up
When it's real I got a grip full of steel
Running down on them field while them niggas hold up
Niggas gotta die, hope you got insurance
Tell em death around the corner, hope your vests is on ya
They go fold when the pressure get up on ya
Pussy you go die

[Chorus]

[Repeat]
