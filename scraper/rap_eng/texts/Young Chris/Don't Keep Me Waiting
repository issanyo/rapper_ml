[Intro: Young Chris]
Fellas grab your shoes
Cars and cruise
Ladies grab a hand
Step in 2's
C. West, Gunnaz

[Slim]
Know 112 is rockin this

[Verse 1: Young Chris]
Everybody groovin
They catchin' feelings
Enter the buildin
See everybody choosin
I'm looking for somebody
With a body that can move it
Thing for them women
But my hobby is my music
Still I'm the coolest
Wrist-wear stupid
Blew it, she know you had it good
When you lose it
Don't miss your train, gotta brain
Betta use it
But don't abuse it
Only if you knew it
You could stay up in the newest
Take you out the buck
N let you coupe it
Late night
We fuckin' to some Cupid
No whinin and dinin
I hit it from behind and
S. Carter the diamond
I gotta part time it
Baby father home wit the kids
Couldn't time it
She laid back blushin'
Rushin for me to climb in her
And this about the only time we get
So right after I hit
Before Ch-ris split

[Chorus: Slim (of 112)]
I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too, ooh, ooh, oooh, oh baby

[Verse 2: Neef Buck]
It was the College Dropout Tour
Yeah out in Cali
House of blues
Right out the blue
Already had it in my mind
I'm rollin out wit you
I'm tellin C
She the one
I'm pickin out the crew
Yeah, nice lil' breezy
We busted up balcony
Watchin Kanyeezy
That got a nigga wheezy
Yeah, tell the bartender
Bring another round
It's cool
We can go through our act
We outta town
I'm kinda feelin
That she feelin it too
I'm tryna hit it
Tryna figure
What she willin to do
Yeah, I'm over at the W
Room 112
I love the way she smell
She say its by Chanel
We kiss get a tell
Spark up the L
That cranberry juice
Wit that good Armadale
And we can get into some lil activities
And if its good
You can come back and visit me

[Chorus: Slim (of 112)]
I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too, ooh, ooh, ooooh, oh baby

[Bridge: Young Chris & Neef Buck]
Fellas grab your shoes
Cars and cruise
Ladies grab a hand
Step in 2's
Ladies grab your heels
Call up all of your girls
Fellas grab your wills
C and Neef, 112
Come on

[Verse 3: Young Chris & Neef Buck]
Now this goes out
To all the girls
Around the world
Massages, Menages
Them back stage twirls
Them bosses
Them flosses
Them Diamonds
And the pearls
Them sweats
And the track nights
Them pros
And them hills
You gotta use
What you got girl
To get what you want
Instead of givin up the ass
Steady smokin the blunts
Come on and Roll
Wit a playa
Get away
From them chumps
You do both
We hit more than once
And don't front

[Chorus: Slim (of 112)]
I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too, ooh, ooh, ooooh, oh baby
