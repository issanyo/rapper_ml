[Hook – Modesty]
Hide from the lies
How do they plan to take me alive?
I’ve walked across them all
Yet they never seem to catch me

[Verse 1 – Young Chris]
Cold summers, hot winters
Cold turkey was a nigga’s hot dinner
Hard headed, hot temper
Y’all boys was pretty soft as I remember
Out in Hollywood, [?] smoking that Cali good
I don’t drink milk, kush doing a body good
Baby give me twirl, I’ll fight for a nigga’s girl
Body Frank, 2010 I’ll rule the world
[?] dinner, Versace t-shirts, except your sneakers
Fuck haters, got extension in every heater
For every diva, fuck her then I leave her
Like I die and get the wounds, what the fuck is left to keep her
Coming through the speaker, headline little feces
Feeling of the least just watching us from the bleachers
Back knee deep in the streets, no way to reach us
Dudes can’t paid to get taught the shit they teach us
Broad day, rockabies, lullabies
“I don’t know shit on tour” my alibi
Told y’all keep it stylist and tie the tie
Perfect without practice, Allen I
Ho niggas talk shit and apologize
Even with the millions you niggas is not as fly
6 feet deep for the week, it’s not a lie
Push it down so them niggas know not to try
No I’m not surprised you niggas hang together
Lames together, Twin desis saying together (Raa raa)
Death, aim right above the neck
The beast is here, the gunner arrived
The odds against him, you hear my hunger and strive
Man you niggas is fake, something to rob
Dead I tell you nigga the gunner alive
Told em he the [?] type got rid of it
Now she at Barney’s swiping unlimited
Ride till the end of it, here to benefit
If you been in it, UPS connect when I’m sending it
A [?] suit, Emmit Smith
In the shoe with a ladder the same height as me
What it do? Fuck the shoe whoever sent you a sucka too
Headshots, bullshit vests we bucking through
With your knuckle too, beat him to a bloody pulp
Stab me in my back, so fuck him, I cut his throat
Gun em all, serve em raw, don’t cut the coke
He’s a pussy deep down inside, just tough approach
They get sent little cells and they ounce flips
When H buckles can’t spell or pronounce shit
Never nigga, that’s tryna beat down shit
Same one you think you down with gon get you down quick
Duck duck goose when the pound lifts
Hospital gown, pull the plug on this clown bitch
When the town hot I’m out of  town shit
Hustling, small town ship, tying down shit
Same niggas that you down with
Gon be the same bitch niggas you get found with
Young niggas down and shit for allowances
Tip talk to him with the silencers (Blaow)
