[Verse 1 - Young Chris]
Leave em in the morgue on the table, shoot till he fatal
Hit you Kennedys from the roof, I told [?] and Trayo
Never me bitter, index in front of the trigger
They rape and tie you up in front of your nigga
Yellow caution is often
Before dark they put em down in the park
Don't get that bitch outlined in some chalk
For every [?] there's a dart, art of war, pick you posers apart
Chopper left a nigga cold in the heart
Stayin low from the narcs
Attack mode how I'm feeling this year
You niggas scared, I can feel in the air
Hard feelings is there, put em deeper
We grim reaper you fucking divas
We add a quarter for 36 of the Justin Bieber
Bout that water, they cutthroats, they getting reckless
One pull of the dust smoke, they getting nekked
Mama struggled, no dad, the streets raised him
Never dipped in that holy water, the heat saved him
To the oils I got em spoiled, that's why they loyal
Known for death in the jungle, nigga I'm bout a soil
I'm in the trenches, finna plot on the sweetest vic
I'm with the jackets, they lurking nigga, they need a lick
Fuck you haters fifth kick like Aker
Duct tape or ransom money, you get that paper
Niggas dare, take this laugh from this cuatro cinco
Reporting live from this block called Wingo
Wing a hawk in my yard, shoutout to H
Fucking cops and my dog, 14 hit the block with my heart
Baby Glock in my drawers, kept a stash
Money sock in my drawer, hustle
While you on top of a whore, I'm on the block with my boys
Hand to hand, and ducking cops and the tourists
Plain clothes, inter tenant explorers, just tryna finish my chores
Shout out to pop, he kept a stash in the store
2 racks for the stash in the door
Bet the chopper can fit, hood check came my first steps nigga
I'm coming, gunna season, I'm alive my nigga, I'm on it
Chasing 11 more, ready for every war, call up the coroner nigga
We leave em deadly whore, we stay consistent on the low low nigga
Two flashy equal the jack boys, I'm po-po nigga
To the death Imma ride, let's dodge these homicides
Kamikaze, competition, bitch I'm alive

[Verse 2 - Santos]
I spark flames to this notepad
I'm crazy with the vocab
These other rappers throw in the towel, I make em show flags
I never was the most have, was more like a have-not
Was raised by the corner store, five it by the back block
Grew up on the realest side, I seen some of the realest die
That's how I learned to stay away from 6 now I can feel they vibe
Like when you shake a nigga's hand you look him dead in his eyes
I had to learn the hard way, cuz I mistaked a million times
This for my dogs with a package in they drawers
Pussys got the hood hot cuz they keep ratting to the law
Back and forth with my bitch, going at it, she be drugged
Cuz every time I leave the crib I be headed to the mall
But I ain't stopping till it's platinum on my wall
And I never get comfortable, cuz I'm better with my back against the wall
That's why I'm putting [?] fear, I kill any rapper here
I passed being hot, I set fire to the atmosphere
A state of emergency, I'm slaying them verbally
Just chasing my currency, niggas say they gon murder me
I hope them pussys coming prepared, we keep it one in the head
But I ain't worried bout nothing, I'm on a hunt for this bread
Growing up I had it rough where I lived
And I ain't have no guidance cuz my brother was dead
So I had to learn to toughen up, white material, suck it up
Stand tall like a man and never be no fucking nut
Rolled another dutch, so I could pop at 30
M dot right beside me and we riding dirty (Molly)
I'm bout to lose control when I spit the booth explode
And I'm a rare nigga, not your average 22 year old
And my attitude is fuck em all
So I'm screaming out fuck the law
I just want to ball
The underdog, I ain't afraid if you're a giant
Cuz my bars made of stone, I'm like when David hit Goliath
Thought I was falling off? nigga not at all
I'm on the rise, they can't wait to see johnny fall
But we ain't playing with haters, so tell em knock it off
Before I make my homie treat your face like a soccer ball
I'm starving nigga, I'm more than hungry
You can't sit around broke when your homies need lawyer money
I'm on my grind bitch you can't get a quarter from me
