Get paralyzed wipe down my shit

And after the party its back to the party at our crib

[Verse 2]

[Verse Three - Young Neef]
If you want it, you can get it
You can come, but'chu can't live here
If I hit it, I want Chris to hit it
To I know you wit it bitches
Mad cause I partied then danced up wit your girl friend
Smoked and bent mainly drunk off Cris'
And I wasn't even feelin that bitch
She actin all pissy same time saditty
A little bit silly I can't even get a quickie
Never that, got a area code for every city
Couple young freaks, couple old heads that dig me
Thinkin they gon' mold me, knowin they can't control me
Young'n been fuckin old head ain't shit you showed me
Got a walk like George and I talk like Goldie
Nope you can't hold me from hittin your homies
I do enough rappin at work listen to oldies

[Chorus - Young Chris : repeat 2X]
"YEEAAH", If you want it
"YEEAAH", Baby you can get it
Still doin shows and after parties
And after the party its back to the party at our crib
