[Intro:]
Trend setta, trend setta
Yeah, you go girl
There's something about you

[Verse 1:]
Roll up through the town, hold a nigga down
Her confidence is up don't care if them other hoes around
She keep her head high and her heels too
She don't depend on no man
When her bills due and that body real too
That Coke bottle shape whole lot a cake
You can touch me baby don't tease me
Though win a whole lot a case
With shorty play the passenger riding with the ghetto hunt
She don't speak no Englo when detectives get to asking her
I'm paid no she never tell everything came at the tell
But I ain't care with the patience baby all ma other ladies I was quick to bail
Ain't no future in fronting girl, flip the bullshit to the back
The I tossed her over and [?] over and let the [?] in the back

[Chorus:]
You go girl that's my bitch [x2]
When I see you, that's my chick [x2]
Ohhh baby, something about you different to me
Than all those other ladies
Something about you that makes me feel like giving you a baby
[If you can fuck him how he wanna be fucked and make a hell of a sandwich, shiiitttt!!]
[you in there like a mo fucka]

[Verse 2:]
She a mo fucka plus ma mother love her
She cool and shit and she cool with sis
Finna go up there to that hotel room one twelve on that cupid shit
When that move done lil jacuzzi fun
Feel like I popped the 10 i’m feeling groovy hun
A lil hookah fun while we lay shitt
Bout to dive in on that Trey shit
She having shots of patron  I put some nut in them drone
I can’t believe how she got me up outta here
Shorty will fuck up her home
Let me see how that body taste
Bite your lips that’s the ride your face
Fuck around with baby boy hopping on it be a lady’s boy
Back-to-back she want more she like one more what  you cum for
If you ain’t come to fuck then what you come for
Then I hit it again before the front door
I gotta go girl

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Everytime I leave shawty asking where i’m at, where i’m at
And I come out to the block and we fucking back-to-back
She got that snapback that snapback

You can put your hips upon it baby
