[Verse: Young Chris]
More drama in the hood, so they goin kill my young
He young and militent, so he goin go get his gun
Step right off, he don't tell us where he goin
20 minutes later, we hear that shit blowin
Niggas scramblin, like what the fuck are they doin
Get a phone call, got another friend gone
His mother and his 2 little brothers in the jail
You know the family member be the hardest one to tell
Now they having fundraisers, scrape enough for the bail
For a few days out, just to get the funeral layed out
Just to see their brothers, in the sell one more time
After that, back to jail, gotta finish some more time
Now retaliation is written on niggas faces
If the shoe was on the other, them some shell cases
That night, that's right, Youngin was rockin like that
Remind me of Mike and the quire, why they rock him like that
Rest in peace Shaneeque, now they deep in the streets
Shot up the wrong block, what about it, more police
Whole hood fish greese, niggas can't sell a dime
Talk about cremation, fuck Imma ttell his mom
Forever he lived through us, rest in peace Lani
Bino sittin for the shit, Johnny back for a hommy
Bitches burned out, walking round like zombies
No work, got niggas walking round like Tommy
Told you niggas, there's grass and Wingohocking where you find me
Niggas sip a lil, got triggers, keep it grimy
I'm the leader of the sonny, keep the heater in the bonny
Number 1 was on the run like fuck, I beat it when they find me
That was my nigga Bird, niggas heard, how they got my nigga life
Loopholes in the story, judge know this shit ain't right
Tough love out the trap, just when we get it right
And we bout to go on tour, damb, I know my nigga tight
Cap shot my nigga Ace, had him in the wealchair
Count it up, so many, tell them niggas we still here
Underground king in this thing, I keeps it trill here
My man got life, while I got a permenant bill
Rest in peace Uncle Boo B, Cappa Tooly
Niggas put holes in him like Goofy
Niggas losin they minds, who the fuck givin m roofys
Nina run it up, G Money turned on Pookies
Hate to bring it up, but ya'll don't know what it done to me
Rest in peace Alieah, Imma send you some more company
Rest in peace Nilly, and Fat Hot
And tell your brother that we know who sent that shot
Niggas goin down, for big bro, you know it
Leave the scene clean, get Dirty Harry to through it
Keep your 2 cents to yourself before you blow it
See right through your blueprint, reading right through the coding
He below it, district in Philly, can't control it
Back to my nigga Johnny, hope he ain't folded
Told it, fuck it, gotta keep it real, you know me
Same day they got him, same day they got his co-D
Say Tweet took the stand, but Tweet still my man
Till I see some paperwork, ya'll don't know the way it hurt
Too many niggas tell it, no, that not the way it work
Hustler cook it right, ain't got no other way to work
Shout out my nigga Cash, and shout out my nigga Rash
Niggas boots, trade duse
Just came home for that, got caught up with Butler
Right back in, for the same shit undercover
My nigga Raw made it out, he kept on pushin
Little bit of ice on my hand, he kept it cookin
First, us in the low, now lowland and west side
Shoot at us everyday, be the first to tell death hi
