[Intro: Young Chris]
Uh, Chad Wes

[Chorus: Young Chris]
The knock is there, the Roc in here
Got a few stacks in my Rocawear
S. Dot's is there, the Glock is there
Red dot is there, there's shots to spare
Hope the doctor's near, I shall fear no man but God
Ready to die, bring the cops in here
All you lil' youngns yeah we got this here
Chad Wes bring it back I think I got this here

[Verse 1: Young Chris]
Whose the flyest from the home of the Flyers
They say them they liars, one hit wonders man they shitty as Kaya
Yeah Gunnaz got the city on fire, and that sticky is fire
Already twisted, Skeezy give me a lighter
Watch the flame as we rise til my nigga retire
Yeah I do it for the kids that admire
Yeah the kid is a fighter, cribs full of pipes
Niggas gettin all nighters, smokers fix your car for a nickel
Ain't no different from Midas
I don't [?] if I do you see a inch in that tire
Knife butter pecan in the back
Heat layin' on my lap, these motherfuckers keep playin' with the rap
I needed the fee, ain't a better example than that
Better learn how to handle your stacks or you be cramped with a bad gamble of stacks tryna scramble it back
Ain't no goddamn fam in this trap, they all shiest
Ya'll just handle the promotion, yo we handle the rap

[Chorus: Young Chris]
The knock is there, the Roc in here
Got a few stacks in my Rocawear
S. Dot's is there, the Glock is there
Red dot is there, there's shots to spare
Hope the doctor's near, I shall fear no man but God
Ready to die, bring the cops in here
All you lil' youngns yeah we got this here
Chad Wes bring it back I think I got this here

[Verse 2: Neef Buck]
Yo the knock is there, the Roc in here
Got my whole fuckin block in here, ya'll from the bird talk
Fuck what you heard ain't no stoppin here
C & Neef back they act like they forgot in here
We from P-H-I, reppin keep the steppin keep a weapon
Nigga shit heat seekin deep in ya flesh and
Ain't no restin when we warn, all times of the morning
On sight and we on em, do it right he's a goner
Niggas hustle on another level, another crib while they hustle for another bezzle, better buy another medal
We from the gutter where its cold, ain't no butter niggas snatchin up your mother, right hand man undercover
Tough Luv overdid it but it didn't now we back with that crack
Big homie got our back, its a wrap, they do whatever for the fame
Fuckin up the game, Brothers From Another here we go motherfuckers!

[Chorus: Young Chris]
The knock is there, the Roc in here
Got a few stacks in my Rocawear
S. Dot's is there, the Glock is there
Red dot is there, there's shots to spare
Hope the doctor's near, I shall fear no man but God
Ready to die, bring the cops in here
All you lil' youngns yeah we got this here
Chad Wes bring it back I think I got this here
