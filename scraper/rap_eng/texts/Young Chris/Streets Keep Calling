[Chorus]
He say the streets keep calling, police keep coming
He ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle
Gotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby
Streets keep calling, police keep coming
He ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle
Gotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby
He gon get it, he gon hustle ya'll
He gon put his money out and make it double ya'll
Make it triple make it quatro make it cinco
Dirty money under mattress when the bank close, stuck in the night life
Promise to never let the night life in
When he get out they pulled him right back in

[Verse 1]
Party and hoes out with the homies like the night never end
Jail the only time life never end
They gave life to my friend
Never hold me right back at the F
Never hold me on Rikers again
Got him strapped down, magazine vest to the chest
Try not to give a knife to they chin
Sendin' kites through the mic I don't write with a pen
Prayin' you don't never spend another night in the pen
I be the bridge to your son keep him tight with his kin
Keep your commissary right when it's in
You ain't gotta ask these bitch ass niggas for nothin' they gon brush it
They might not give back to you they gon discuss it to these hoes and the bros when they try to look big
All they do is screamin' free you whole time through your bid
Postin' pictures on the gram like 'free my man'
When the last time you niggas went to see my man
When the last time you put a check on his line or went around and checked on his mom
Ya'll ain't real your lying
Counted him out when he said his goodbyes
He call home and you never push five
Shoulda deaded it then, it's like a real nigga never can win
You know the moral of the story baby never depend

[Chorus]
He say the streets keep calling, police keep coming
He ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle
Gotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby
Streets keep calling, police keep coming
He ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle
Gotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby
He gon get it, he gon hustle ya'll
He gon put his money out and make it double ya'll
Make it triple make it quatro make it cinco
Dirty money under mattress when the bank close, stuck in the night life
Promise to never let the night life in
When he get out they pulled him right back in
Stuck in the night life
Promise to never let the night life in
When he get out they pulled him right back in

[Verse 2]
Wipin' tears from my mother face
Her youngest out on another tour, her oldest out on another case
Somewhere out in another state
Back and forth to court it's another wait
Watchin' mother break down from what the judges say
Don't trip be cool that's what my brother say
Tryna parole where his baby mother stay
I gotta tell my neph daddy gotta stay another day
Tryna explain it to my niece in another way
Daddy gone, he'll be home
All we gotta do is just pray it don't be long
Walk the track get you wacked my nigga be strong

[Chorus]
He say the streets keep calling, police keep coming
He ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle
Gotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby
Streets keep calling, police keep coming
He ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle
Gotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby
He gon get it, he gon hustle ya'll
He gon put his money out and make it double ya'll
Make it triple make it quatro make it cinco
Dirty money under mattress when the bank close, stuck in the night life
Promise to never let the night life in
When he get out they pulled him right back in
Promise to never let the night life in
When he get out they pulled him right back in

[Verse 3]
Got a old head that cook it the best
We call him OG Heff stay in the hood he's the chef
All the old heads respect him all the young boys love him
All the fiends go to him all the hoodrats fuck him
Nigga caught up in the hustle
He can never get out
Might catch a little case and let it sit out
Right back to it, once he heard they like that fluid
He put some water on the block added some white back to it
And he got it for the low added his price back to it
Took a loss had to fight back through it
Now or never said he liked that music
Every youngn OG just caught another case and his son is [?]

[Chorus]
He say the streets keep calling, police keep coming
He ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle
Gotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby
Streets keep calling, police keep coming
He ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle
Gotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby
He gon get it, he gon hustle ya'll
He gon put his money out, and make it double ya'll
Make it triple make it quatro make it cinco
Dirty money under mattress when the bank close, stuck in the night life
Promise to never let the night life in
When he get out they pulled him right back in
Stuck in the night life
Promise to never let the night life in
When he get out they pulled him right back in
