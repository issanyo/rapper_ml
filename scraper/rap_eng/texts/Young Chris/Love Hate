[Verse 1]
It's for the taken, history in the making
Break records, Emmit to Aikman, never limit your faith
'Less it's best, gotta limit your space
Never rush you gotta pace, you want to win at the race
Right back to the gravel, I go travel and blow
It's like a rush when ain't used to having the dough
It got me jonesin, back to back 5 in the morning
Loosing sleep, just to outwork my opponents
Back zoning, on that Drizzy he ready to own it
Too much goose got him loose, he ready to tone it
Carsick, OG he threw the tent
Marshawn Lynch, gunna breaking through the defense
Pass season, of course he throw it, he had C
Richard Sherman take victory from Crabtree
Broke now, had [?] of the day
Just like the streets it can go the other way
Any day, any sec, respect the spitters, not many left
Every time I rhyme the left side of my chest
Even if he's winded he never runs out of breath
Never run out of pain, never run out of bars
Keep watching my prey, and y'all gon run out of yards
Never run out and tell, we can't afford a charge
Everything on the scale, we can't afford a loss
Whole team lame, everybody a fraud
Leave it up to the gram, now everybody a boss
Sacrifice for rap, for everybody considered
In the streets a ho, now everybody can hit it
Now I just spit it how I live it, body and everything
Bar for bar, pound for pound, Mayweather in every ring
Aggressive like Tyson, power like Lennox
Tap em like Muhammad, they Sugar just like Leonard
They feminine, a bunch of pussy hoes
Young randy, you's the rookie foes
Just a team up out of north Philly
He was good in every hood he chose, he got so much to offer
Now the talent's there, on the flipside the violence's there
The fame though, it's one hell of a balance there
The ain't break him, only made him, he's alive
