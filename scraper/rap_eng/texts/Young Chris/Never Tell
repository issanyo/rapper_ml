[Intro]
Sarom on the track
Loyalty and integrity baby
Word and my balls
That's till the casket dip

[Verse 1]
Cheers to never hatin' and never breakin' under investigation
It's a celebration
Never waitin', never hesitatin'
So many squares it's circle and faces
Face full of tears when I read the statement
The shit can't be real they better be fakin'
Promise not to tell and never ever ever would send my brother to jail
Code of the streets we don't know the police
We say no to police, three k's before the police
Freeze with holes in they sheets, pussy nigga I'm exposin' this freak
Put him to sleep snatch his soul from the weak
Put that bag on they head
Bet them more tag toe on they feet
Nigga fade john doe in the streets
You ain't low in the streets nigga you'z a hoe in these streets
And that street credit was deaded once you told the police

[Chorus]
Promise to never tell
Promise to never tell
Said I promise to never tell I promise to never tell
Promise to never tell
Tell them crackers to send me to jail say they gon be diggin' ditches up
Before I ever give my nigga up
Fuck boys I ain't wit it bruh

[Verse 2]
Got a right to remain silence you ain't had to
Seen the same old stories with Frank Mathews
Wayne Perry, these lames scary
Big Meech they gon fold when it get deep and it get hot
But we live by the code of the streets
And these bitches love every rat that got some dough for these freaks
I can't roll like that, said I would never break a code for the [?]
Stupid bitch deserve a hole in her head, kill em both dead
Take em alive, put em to bed
Take em for a ride, put em in the trunk
Toss her the [?], we take em down
Extortion every month, I want a portion of your life pussy
They took my man, investigation for murders and I never took a stand
You had a right pussy, right to remain silent
Tryna keep the balance for violence and great talent mufuckas

[Chorus]
Promise to never tell
Promise to never tell
Said I promise to never tell I promise to never tell
Promise to never tell
Tell them crackers to send me to jail say they gon be diggin' ditches up
Before I ever give my nigga up
Fuck boys I ain't wit it bruh

[Outro]
Yeah you hear it nigga, I'm still in these trenches
Don't mistake me for them hoe ass niggas
You catch Young C wherever nigga
Hood star catch me at the hood bar
They scammin' they scared
These niggas don't come outside
Solo dolo knock you niggas heads off
Aye, no tellin nigga, keep ya mouth shut
Hoe ass niggas, hoe ass niggas
Said they talkin' too much, niggas talkin' too much
