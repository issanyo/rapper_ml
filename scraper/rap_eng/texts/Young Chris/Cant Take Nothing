[Intro:]
The cannon the cannon
For years they try to stick that bullshit to us
But the streets love us though
Thats who we do it for
[step back] It’s the can’t take nothing from us

[Chorus:]
They love me, the good the ugly
They try to take me down can’t take nothing from me
No, no [Network 3] you gotta feel me though
Yow yow cause that’s ma city yow

[Verse 1:]
Walls closing in the plugs holding out
Party is bout to end the clubs closing out
System so corrupted it came with no instructions
I come with loaded 40s with appetite for destruction
They try to catch me slipping they thought I wasn’t ready
I hold it as he said it I would never [?] heavy
Hope you hold your water they try to break you levy
The casket often a dip with a matic sleeping them [?]
I’m from the darkest alleys the set that [?] expenses
I do them niggas solo don’t need me no co-defendant
A spy is just a tangle i’m tired of hopping fences
Drinking too much purple till it’s fucking up their dentures

[Chorus]
The streets they love me, the good the ugly
They try to take me down can’t take nothing from me
No, no you gotta feel me though
Yow yow cause that’s ma city yow
I say the streets they love me, the good the ugly
They try to take me down can’t take nothing from me
No, no you gotta feel me though
Yow yow cause that’s ma city yow

[Verse 2:]
Roads get tougher lives get harder
But ma vision gets brighter as the nights get darker
Sig be the dopest told y’all he’s focused
Away from all you haters you fucker suckers and vultures
Flows up to par i’m coming from the tar
A beam just in case i gotta hit you from a far
And ma job it was war way before I was a star
Walking down on shit way before we had a car
Won’t be a statistic never be like then old broke niggas that missed it
Fifty and getting lifted can’t fall victim gotta beat the system
Now the rhythm with these lyrics as a keep them equal dope nigga

[Chorus:]
They love me, the good the ugly
They try to take me down can’t take nothing from me
No, no [Network 3] you gotta feel me though
Yow yow cause that’s ma city yow
I say the streets they love me, the good the ugly
They try to take me down can’t take nothing from me
No, no [Network 3] you gotta feel me though
Yow yow cause that’s ma city yow

[Outro:]
I say the streets they love me, the good the ugly
They try to take me down can’t take nothing from me
No, no [Network 3] you gotta feel me though
Yow yow cause that’s ma city yow
