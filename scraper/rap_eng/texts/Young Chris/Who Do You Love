[Intro][x3]
Stand in the ghetto, hand on my metal
Pedal to the floor, tell them whores get on my level

I ain't with the fake shit, young nigga bout a dollar
Gotta run the shop, switching shifts every hour
Carter like Nino, talk like Sarpino
Filipinos,  VVS cuffs, I'm that clean though
Barcaleni, new gazzelis, this shit they tell me
No dilemma, Cali Nelly new pelly pelly
Keep your shit Kelly, I want my spot take two
They don't want gutter to break through
Right after the hit, right back to the strip, flipping sour
No newborn, we giving showers
Heavy chance of death, sad song from the choir
We right back to the ghetto, my dezi under the tire
I grew a passion for rapping, go get it if I desire
My legacy more important than money when I retire
You know them niggas admire, bunch of snakes in the grass
Stick a prod up they ass, give em trash
You know them niggas are fire, competition is none
Pause, they ain't talking slick as my tongue, I kill em all
Damn right, I'm a fucking champ, from a different cloth
Lock, load, aimed up, I get them looking off
Scream war, we get to bodying you niggas, nigga
Snap shots until you get the picture
Hanging niggas liquor, before a nigga hit her
She suck a nigga good, pussy wet as a [?]
She'll grab your pole, go up and down just like a stripper
You'd rather trick her, pull down my zipper that's how I tip her
That's how I does it, gunna balling, We out your budget
C created it player, haters they got to love it
Clip extendo, big choppers we recommendo
Climb the ladder with Big Ladders and crack the window
Take the safe out, stay home, it ain't safe out
Box em in puffy, no way out, they took the gay route
Fuck boys, fuck boys I get em layed out
Young nigga starving I'm ready to take out
Click clack bow!
Young niggas is just that wild
Without a gun you was just that child
Now he a hitter, he run around, couple shooters, now he your nigga
Nigga you's a dick eater, he ain't doing shit either
What's the motherfucking business?
Nigga you's a witness
Put em in the test and fucking leave them for forensics
Hit them niggas where it hurt though, kill em all, murked up
