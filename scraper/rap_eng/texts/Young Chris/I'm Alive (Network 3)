[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm from the north of 'delph
Momma birthed the king on the murder scene
Daddy was a fiend but he stayed clean
Sharper than a crease in his jean
Older brother took his place though
Still momma see him every time she see my face though
Drugs got the best of one of my favorite cousins
Chances of him changing is one of my haters loving
Grand Hustle and ducking officers all night
Married to the streets at the alter with all white
Pistol in my polos, work up in the tire
Never leaving in at home where even its on I'm ready to fire
Dribbling back to Pontiacs and Marwuese at Aunt Peach's
North of 'delph to them palm beaches with fine divas
Pitty scramblers popping cans still I got the green on me
Got the dark Mr. Clark keep the lean on me
Dodging cops and haters that's trying to put the beam on me
Got my nigga Dean with me, Bird got machines on him
Y'all was playing rough house, we was in the drug house
On our enemy's turf like a Crip in a Blood house
Take an abandoned building and turn it into a club house
Back with Beanie Sigel we showing you what a thug 'bout
Body fill with hate when they take someone you love out
Still shining bright like a light whenever the bulb out
We was the younger niggas older niggas couldn't stand
They took my man, I'll never take the stand
Or the church or the dirt, payed a hell of a price
Years later Bird got jailed for life
See death around the corner I can read it in my palm
Getting high knowing I'm have seizures when I'm on
Waking up with needles in my arm
Lost my brother Larry now my daughter see his born
In memory of Betty and Debbie and Uncle Boobie
Your boy be the sequel, I promise to make a movie
I'm alive niggas!

[Break]

[Verse 2]
H [?] and Bugs in a wheelchair
Fuck it this a blessing you're still here
Though you paralyzed I know the pain you feel there
Just know you got one nigga that still care
Cutting class momma ain't know thought I was still there
Tough love brothers from another, now the deal here
Now we got them Young Gunz running through the city street
Fucking all the bad bitches, all they know Chris and Neef
Johnny did eight straight right back for homicide
Young hip hop tell Nas that I'm alive
Running around with a full pound and a big bulldog
Young nigga gave you that Gunplay before Ross
Now we on that Roc shit trying to pull a tour off
Yeah we made a couple, but, niggas made more off
Here about that stash Philly niggas kick your door off
Cops make us leave, right back when they pull off
Nails still dirty, my nigga I'm seeing thirty
Do it for the ounce niggas trying to see a birdy
I'm alive! L.A. you heard me
You'll never lose a grip, business is strudy
Even though my whip clean I ride dirty
From eating Black Eyed Peas, to fucking bitches like Fergie
I promise my dog no matter what I'll get 'em murdered
Catch a body, pay a hundred, fucking wait for the verdict
Fake friends counted me out, yelling fuck 'em though
Even through all the hate still love 'em though
Never catch a nigga slip gotta still tuck 'em though
Pluck 'em though, ballers like Jim Kelly, Buffalo
Gotta keep it going for my family that suffer though
All the shit I've been through made a nigga tougher though
All the shells I dodged, all the friends lost
Promise to get it in until we meet at the cross
I'm alive niggas!
