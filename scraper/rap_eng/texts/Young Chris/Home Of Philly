[Verse One: Beanie Sigel]
Rule number one, keep them gloves on you
Loading up that biscuit, fuck all that print shit
So when you "shoot" you won't go down to district
Keep a loaded revolver that save a lot of problems

[Young Chris]
I know shells walk with you

[Beanie Sigel]
Look, let me talk with you Young
Always steered you strong dawg
Never wrong dawg

[Young Chris]
You told me way back then you'd put me on dawg

[Beanie Sigel]
And I stood tall dawg

[Young Chris]
Shit, like city hall dawg

[Beanie Sigel]
The city's our's dawg
See them Bentley's? Ours dawg
Look at Free, he going dawg
Tell Neef "C'mon dawg"
You gon' be to me like Cease could've been a Big
Like Sauce should've been a Jay
For Cee across the bridge
That's how it is
That's how it go, any problems with that kid
Tell a nigga what it is
Young Chris tell them niggas how we live

[Hook: Young Chris (Beanie Sigel]
Where the fiends on every corner
(Dope heads on every other)
The jails got all the fathers
(The coke got all the mothers y'all)
Baby on one "shoot"
(Dope up in the other arm)
Another crack baby born
(They've got us trapped crazy y'all)
The home of Philly where they cook out everyday
(Raid the block every other)
The hustlers on every corner
(The cops on every other y'all)
Niggas will "shoot"
(And think nothing of it ch'all)
Bodies every other y'all
(But we gotta love it ch'all
The home of Philly)

[Verse Two: Beanie Sigel]
I know you just lost your homie Chris that nigga was your heart

[Young Chris]
Yup, just like a brother
One of my littlest homie's mayne
Many of 'em phony mayne

[Beanie Sigel]
But Chris you play smart

[Young Chris]
Words from my homie, didn't mean to leave you lonely Scrap

[Beanie Sigel]
Let him rest in peace Chris
Just protect his peeps Chris

[Young Chris]
I rest with heat so you'll never catch me sleep
[?] up the streets I'ma rep it till we meet still
Puffing off the 'dro still, sexing all the freaks
They like it when it's me

[Beanie Sigel]
But they love it when it's both y'all

[Young Chris]
They love us both dawg

[Beanie Sigel]
And we know you love 'em most dawg

[Young Chris]
Shit, ain't been the same since he left out the hood
Told you, lay y'all for good

[Beanie Sigel]
Watch a lot of niggas change Chris
Time to make that change Chris

[Young Chris]
What, get up out the hood?

[Beanie Sigel]
Yup

[Young Chris]
The only thing can't trust nobody with them thangs now
Gotta keep them thangs down now

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Beanie Sigel]
Chris, I ain't trying to change you I'm just sharing game
Get stuck up in the street dawg, we running with the fame
I'm telling you some true shit
Shit it ain't no new shit it's rules to the game
I'm just following the Blueprint
And correction ain't punishment dawg, don't be stupid

[Young Chris]
Mack, you know what's a shame?
I ain't new to the game but my pop's was a lame
Couldn't school me to the game
Had to pick up on my brother and his gang

[Beanie Sigel]
Chris what you saying?
I was born through the same
Dynasty, track sixteen, daddy where you been?
Still sharp as steel dawg, I'ma keep you sharp
Catch more flies with honey dawg, then you do with salt

[Young Chris]
Mack I'm taking heed with everything
But don't believe in everything

[Beanie Sigel]
That's what I'm saying dawg, now we seeing clear
Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear

[Hook]
