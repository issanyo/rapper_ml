[Intro:]
This what we use to
This remind me of that
That good nice  tell [?] and shit
That old German tale mail Mary shit
That South Philly shit
This what I like to get into
Three's a charm, the network

[Verse 1:]
Mama 2 jobs daddy too high uncle Wok fried uncle Joe too fly
Brother baby mama introduce me to the lie
That boy hit a win ain't no loose or no retire loosen up the tie
Back in my street where it’s deep here
Bang out with the police here the boss is only me here
They gave my nigga life my nigga pose to be here
That bitch ain't pose to be here so more war we declare
Shout out my younging dean shout out my younging wiz
No more leg shots next time in the wig
Meanwhile we cutting more deals while you bid
So come home and make up for the time that ya’ll did
Too many niggas tell somebody is with the pig
Somebody's got a rundown on somebody with the sig
You know somebody’s gonna take somebody where you live
Put in and let forensic find the bodies at the crib

[Chorus:]
You know we keep a hundred ever drumroll
Hope you ain't around when it unfolds
Them niggas sit you down if you take the stand
Them boys are killer man I bought a kilogram
You boys ready to die we can hack a strip
Street shit, street shit, uh you boys ready to die
Nigga  hack a strip street shit, street shit, street shit


[Verse 2:]
Your ass be dropping names like a game song
And the streets treating it right like it ain't wrong
Fucking clowns tight lames a put my goons on
Bloodstains they leave his name in a tombstone
Way of life kid Cudi we day and night
Got that player price for the Ye I like don’t take it light
That’s why your girl cheating scum nigga laying pipe
Rest in peace pimp got the world pouring in they Sprite
Selling Coca-Cola pockets full of stones
Fill it to the top and let it pop until it's gone
Guy was in a dorm up in Calis with a loan
I was breaking hoes making profit off the song
Mama was a dear papa never home
Clientele running got it popping off the phones
Whoever in the chair we knock them off the throne hip hop this is where I belong

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Visions of a hustler pigeons in the dumpster
Niggas wanna kill you bitches wanna fuck you
Nigga you is a  snitch niggas wanna cut you
Niggas better duck down smith and west blop town
We ain’t give a fuck then we don’t give a fuck now
Hop on like the president you bring them trucks round
Zombies all over the hood you know that dust round
Snitch boy was a pitbull he's a mutt now
Louis on my stitching Stewart on my luggage
Signed a new deal caught a connect wit ma new budget
Shout out [?] and [?] go through ma old strip and flood it
The niggas and the bad bitches fuck with

[Chorus]
