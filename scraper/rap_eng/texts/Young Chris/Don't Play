[Intro: Meek Mill]
You hear that? Sounds like new money
New money, new money, new money

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Pull up in the hood and I'm sitting on Wood
Like a motherfucker should
Man these niggas don't play with me
Man these niggas dont play with me
Red bottom boss
It don't matter what the cost
If she like it then I got it
Man these bitches don't play with me
Man these bitches don't play with me

[Verse 1: Young Chris]
Tyler Ennis, 'bout our business
Ball harder, Jabari Parker
Young Gunna, Meek Milly
No disrespect but we Philly
King and Wade, Shaq and Kobe
Call my hitter black Ginobili
Young niggas hold the block down
Ride winter time with the top down
Tell them little pussy boys don't play with me
Got a buck and a drum I got the K with me
Shine harder whenever you turn the lights off
We in the jungle, whenever we turn the mics off
Niggas get scared when they see this
When they see that boy Meek, then they see Chris
God  dammit  we nice, 'tana and Rice
Finna body bag niggas, hand me his life

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Pull up in the hood and I'm sitting on Wood
Like a motherfucker should
Man these niggas don't play with me
Man these niggas dont play with me
Red bottom boss
It don't matter what the cost
If she like it then I got it
Man these bitches don't play with me
Man these bitches don't play with me

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
Pull up in the hood, on wood
Bad bitch rolling, and she rolling on wood
Finna get some head on the little [?]
Got extendo, on my new stash blocks
Can't give a fuck about the cops
Finger to the force
Only 911 that we know is the Porsche
Fuck about you niggas, If there's drama
Bring the llama, turn enemies into corpses
Get em touched with the torch
More shotties than K, more bodies than days
Death I ain’t surprised the more I ain’t amazed
Homicide on you niggas the yellow caution is off
The pussy niggas ain't riding, just helping carry the coffin
Showing off for them hoes
Taking shots in the first
Taking shots from the fifth, take a ride in a hearse
Never take me alive, I told you niggas before
6 shots from the drum, sending them to the morgue
Who the fuck want war?

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Pull up in the hood and I'm sitting on Wood
Like a motherfucker should
Man these niggas don't play with me
Man these niggas dont play with me
Red bottom boss
It don't matter what the cost
If she like it then I got it
Man these bitches don't play with me
Man these bitches don't play with me

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
Pull up to the hood on hoes
Hoes start flocking, like a bad bitch suppose
I don't give a fuck about you haters
See I'm all about the paper
Getting money, in the hood and the road
I done platinum and the gold
Nigga ride fleet
That bitch  ride dick, like that nigga ride deep
Only the latest fashion, classy fly cars
A nigga been eating, on the block 5 stars
Came in the game, I was Hov young nigga
Nigga still [?] cold young nigga
Y'all boys ain't ready, Ride 'round heavy
Gold bezel on Prezi, Gold buckle on Giuseppe
All about the little Debbie, sitting on wood
Circling the block bullshitting through the hood
Hop out on my niggas, Imma smoke a few ounce
Hoping I ain't gotta let off a few shells
This is tales of the hood nigga

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Pull up in the hood and I'm sitting on Wood
Like a motherfucker should
Man these niggas don't play with me
Man these niggas dont play with me
Red bottom boss
It don't matter what the cost
If she like it then I got it
Man these bitches don't play with me
Man these bitches don't play with me
