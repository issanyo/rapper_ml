[Verse 1]
High as a pilot, smoking inside it
Broke with a product, nigga what you know about it?
Walk in the blood, tipping leaving the rug
How we fuck up the club that VV click on above
Fresh as Hilfiger and Nautica
Sergio Tacchini, I be killing call the coroner
Holes in his wardrobe, internet with head shots
Catch him while he’s sleeping, young money make his bed rock
Devil around the corner pick him apart
Leave that bitch in the chart, dish in the park
Ace in the 80’s, war and it’s crazy
Fresh out the cleaners started with 4 and a baby
Now I’m addicted to the money I know that it’s real
Same time know that it kill got to know when to chill
Know when you get it the cops fast and niggas watch
Niggas test them choppas chopping somebody dropping
Mexican standoff, shoot first and die last
Reach slow you die fast, niggas cock blast
Last showers, big chances of storm on em
Mad shout swarm on em, ring the alarm on em
Enemy number one, tool up
From the block and we shoot up
Getting rid of you poo putts
Take the roof off and soup the coupe up
Burn the mic down and tear the booth up
Dance while you lube up, [?] nigga
Time to make the place hot
Niggas ain’t surviving all these K shot
Take a nigga’s top off, make em take the block off
Get you niggas knocked off, tied up and dropped off
Tales of the darkside, nigga you’s a small fry
We don’t ever stop shop even if the law try
Keep you niggas wiped out, show em how my dogs ride
Real shooters walk up, now they hit em all high
Wish you niggas luck though, tryna take cedar [?]
Pussy niggas gusto, you ain’t seeing CP4
Thinking shit’s sweet, talking shit up in his rap verse
Now a sore sight pussy nigga Imma clap first
VVS cut though, still riding plush though
We don’t bring her back ‘less the bitch tryna fuck though
Only ride with Dezi, my bad bitch Nina
Protect Aquafina, shock under the beamer
Shocking is medulla, Young Chris the ruler
Name a youngin that’s cooler, champagne and Cubans
Dirt rocks in Bermuda, bad hoes and tequila
Iced out the Mueller, bought a bitch pre milla
Cold with my chinchilla baby, form like Reggie Miller baby
Since I been dealing I been milling baby
Check out my limp walk, chi stroke
Give me your mouth, let me see if you can deep throat
Hopping through the roof girl, I’m the truth baby
Fuck a telly, we can fuck up in my coupe baby
She ain’t my bitch, she the crew lady
She got pregnant on my niggas like ‘who baby?’
Bitch you crazy, running down on the gang
Now the bitch talking down on my name, tryna fuck up the mojo
Got a bad bitch, the fattest total
Nutting everywhere, fuck up the polo
VVS on my Rolex, heart cold as a goalie
Jerry Maguire showed me you niggas already know me
I ain’t fit for the bullshit nigga
Mac 11 full clip niggas better duck down
We giving em more trip
