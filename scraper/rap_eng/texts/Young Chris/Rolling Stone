[Intro]
Give me that, give me that, give me that beat nigga
Gunna season
Gunna season nigga

[Verse 1]
They say he forever gone like gunna you’re never home
A diamond up in the rough, like papa a rolling stone
I got me some rolling papers, I take a shot of patron
Tell Jay and Yeezy I’m coming, let’s take a shot at the throne
I handle like Kyrie Irving, won’t take me out of my zone
I’m dancing like Darren Sproles, I’m breaking out in the dome
Frustration when it occur, I take it out on the song
Take time away from my daughter that’s [?] when she [?]
Tell em

[Hook]
(Papa was a rolling stone [x4])
We on a roll roll, we on a roll roll
(Papa was a rolling stone [x2])

[Verse 2]
Now my day is getting darker, tryna dodge an early grave
Tryna survive where I reside, getting higher early stage
Still he fly, hitting the women, [?], he dip in the linens
So cold, dipping in foreign, 100, put in the engine
Vroom vroom, to the north of death
Bap bap, should’ve bought your vest
We make em get down and laydown
Tex, we snort the best, six shots, should be enraged
Them Glocks, you see them K’s
You fuckers should be amazed
The block, the VMA’s
Nigga we faded, nigga we faded
Drinking soulja
Nigga we made it, nigga we made it
Taking over
Back to travel all over the world, all for daddy’s little girl
So the [?] when she cross so when I go just let her know that

[Hook]
