[Intro: Slim]
I already know what it is...been with the nigga for a long time
Got a shorty wit him, but you ain't happy, your comfortable
And you know what happen when you get comfortable right? You scared?

[Verse 1: Young Chris]
California weed, California weather
Ridin' in Miami back in Philly where I met her
My other bitch couldn't get it together
She couldn't get it together
I thought I could never, find a cookie much better
But her ass way fatter and that pussy much wetter
And she treat a nigga way better, treat a nigga way better
Face in the shower, rain baby rain
Love the sounds of your moan, legs shake as she came
I wanna hear my name, I do it till you drained
Long as you stay the same and don't do it to the gang
You'll be good girl, play ya part love
We'll build a bonnet they could never break apart love
Turn the lights on, no in the dark love
No playin' mind games, just let your heart love
Damn you cold

[Chorus: Slim]
It's hard for me to find words and thighs
But when your next to me it feel come to mind
Baby I, I think, I seen't ya
And I see my future
We can go so far just from right here
So I'm hopin' that your not scared

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
She say he never there and all she want is love
Mommy a sex fiend and I can be your drug
She don't wanna get caught up
Prayers never brought up
But that ain't my intentions I ain't hear to mess the fort up
I'm just trying to show you better places to go to
I'm talkin' global, he too local
Break from the campus come and stay at the Atlantis
Take your chances take advantage
King size wet sheets, sex on the best beach
Sweet tooth ya sex sweet
Fuckin you till next week
Wildin' Thomas Crown, we naked on an island
Her pussy smilin' as bright as my medallion
Hoe what a night, now she call her girls up
Right after I roll one, her time to twirl up
Introduce you to some shit that fuck ya world up
You haters let ya love down them players pick ya girl up
Come on niggas

[Chorus: Slim]
It's hard for me to find words and thighs
But when your next to me it feel come to mind
Baby I, I think, I seen't ya
And I see my future
We can go so far just from right here
So I'm hopin' that your not scared
