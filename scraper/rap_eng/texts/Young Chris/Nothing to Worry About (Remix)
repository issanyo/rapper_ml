C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down [x3]

[Hook]
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
I've got nothin' to worry about
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
I've got nothin' to worry about

[Verse One: Wale]
Why would I worry? I am forever blessed
That "Brings Me To Life" in a sense, Evanes-scence
The fence they was on about my rap skills
They over now, now my lawn like a yard sale
Huh
I'm just sellin' my thoughts there
You'll be rich in 2010 if you bought shares
I ain't bullshittin', I am Chris Barch here
I deserve cheers how I rap tour every year
Got shows on top of shows
In between bass, yes, I tour onto/Toronto
What you call hate
I call motivation
Why worry if the single were to heal the nation?
Why worry if the single play on every station?
You should worry if every single critic don't hate ya
I've been through all the bull, switch formation
Get your paper, see you later

[Hook]
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
I've got nothin' to worry about
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
I've got nothin' to worry about

[Verse Two: Young Chris]
Never break, took a break though
But I'm right back cause the fans couldn't wait though
This is that Kobe and reason this is a Lake show
Hustle from Regis and Kelly into the Late Show
Cat is doin' what he know just to make doe
Still lay low between the treble and the bass though
Friend or foe, niggas still can't tie the lace though
Nigga who?
Yeah okay, if you say so
Little haters can't mess up how my day go
Fuckin' squirrel, bet his girl still buy the tape though
Treat her like a kid, let her run through the play though/Play Doh
By the way yo, fresh day though (K.O.!)
Hey ho
With or without H.O
Forever on my J.O
Era of the 8-0's
Clips in the play clothes
Trips in the cake holes
Whores on the track and your bitch on the pay roll

[Hook]
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
I've got nothin' to worry about
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
I've got nothin' to worry about

[Verse Three: Rhymefest]
Why everybody so serious?
Can't smile, take a picture, gotta frown
But I came to get down
2 Live Crew, +Doo Doo Brown+
Tax free, that's me, my money got acne
Cause I break it out a lot
$50 chickenpox
$100 measles man, issue me with ego man
Ride around in Cadillacs (Oh he got an ego man)
Hey
This should be illegal man
I can buy your publishin' like Michael did the Beatles band (hee hee!)
I'll beat your ass into a fetal stance
And DJ's play my records cause I make the needles dance
+I Was Born By The River+ like Sam Cooke
But I'm in the Bible like Moses, read the damn Book
In parties, I part seas, these partly MC's, can hardly temp me, you entry
Level
Beginner
You low zero and I beat all y'all ass in a game of Guitar Hero

[Hook]
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
I've got nothin' to worry about
C'mon everybody let's all get down, let's all get down, let's all get down
I've got nothin' to worry about
