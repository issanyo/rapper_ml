[Intro – Billy Blue]
I roll up on em, I’m looking at em
I’m grinning at em, fuck it I’m getting at em

[Verse 1 – Billy Blue]
You a hater nigga? Well I’m a hater too
I got it on my mind, fuck you niggas want to do?
I hate hoes, they hate me
They got a problem with the swag, all black tees
How I feel about a nigga, bitch, ask me
Riding through the hood, chopper on the back seat
Had to murk a nigga cuz he tried to steal my CO
Don’t know about him but that ain’t how we roll
I’m here full [?], pussy nigga you’s a zero
Got the kryptonite out for you motherfucking heros
You balling in the club, sucking dick up on the d-low
I ain’t got to say his name, but best believe that he know
You said [x3] pussy nigga
You said [x3] holler at em bro!

[Hook – Billy Blue]
I’m getting at em, I’m getting at em
Throw up a finger at em, just know I’m getting at em
Woah, fuck nigga, ho nigga, sucka nigga, broke nigga
Shit real around here but you ain’t know nigga?
What I got to murk a nigga just to show niggas?
I’m getting at em [x3]
Throw up a finger at em
I’m getting at em [x3]
Throw up a finger at em

[Verse 2 – Billy Blue]
I’m sliding on em, like it’s electric
I’m on the top floor, get on my level bitch
I watch niggas, stop niggas
And if he slipping best believe I’m gonna drop niggas
Ho niggas never gonna catch me riding with that
Run up in the spot, zone man where the sack at?
You see the strap, you see your life
You see these niggas, they running through your wife
I’m gutter nigga, ain’t like these other niggas
Real talk, I don’t pacify sucker niggas
Fuck I look like? Somebody’s daddy nigga?
Hand on the trigger, I’m feeling happy nigga
Dead [x14]

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Young Chris]
I’m sliding up, you don’t why they hide up
Hit while they ain’t looking, tie em up and ride em, what?
Pussys, I’m getting at em, pointing the pistol at em
She want two 23s, spraying the missiles at em
F and F fiftys, caliber’s up to 50
Forever street, ho ass cowards ain’t fucking with me
Nigga that’s how we serve em, hit em up, we plot to murder
We loading up the lead, we shoot them motherfuckers dead
It’s murder, death, homicide
Race like me, you got to ride
Bitch I gets to it, I’m a hustler, ain’t no 9 to 5
I fucks with niggas that flip that work
Block on a Saturday, shit that shirt
Got some niggas AK shooters
That’ll go strap up and get cats murked
Guns go bang, I let my nuts hang on you pussy
We rang, them brand new machines
Yeah this is how we really do, this Young Chris and Billy Blue
Make some noise for MIA let’s show these niggas how Philly do

[Hook]
