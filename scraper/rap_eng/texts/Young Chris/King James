[Verse 1 - Young Chris]
Young niggas work hard, broad day in the park
We murder shit, rain hail sleet snow
Y'all niggas in the crib, we serving shit
I got a clock for a block full of North Philly rebels
Every time a young nigga hit the club
Nigga was a fly little dude, b-ball player
Now you all fucked up, addicted to the shrubs
Nigga been known since I knocked my plug
Hating ass niggas can't stop my flow
No a nigga can't fall in love with a ho
And a ho end up with a nigga I know
Triple beam dream, young nigga on schemes
Run through the [?] put the bitches on [?]
Front through the block, leave that bitch home [?]
Then I run through the work, got to visit my fiends
Now a nigga strapped up on winging hawk
Right back on the corner
With a bunch of young thug niggas that's slinging rock
Thank god I'm an owner
And they all slanging work, they all claiming turf
Till they back the old hearse in
Tryna say a verse or two, let the choir sing
Let them pack the whole church in

[Verse 2 - Kur]
Me and phil pack so much loud (shower)
So much loud some like it washed up in it
We them niggas at Ruth Chris
Eating mac and cheese with the lobster in it
Funny how I'm eating five star
But just a year ago ain't have a pot to piss in
I get bored with rap, it ain't no competition
That's Young Chris, here go some competition
And I pop perks, but they are not prescripted
Turn my block into a CVS
Fuck a doctor visit, how you tryna eat and ain't tryna chip in
If I ever go to a bitch crib I am pulled up
I will not be slipping
If you run into me put 33 all on your back just like Scottie Pippen
If this rap shit don't work out, ok I got another plan
Look, Imma bubblegrams and put tax on the work like Uncle Sam
I was a product of my environment, so I had no choice to sell product
And I had no choice to stand on corners with a hoodie on
Like yo cop up, and my neighbors call and make the cops come
When I was just tryna make an income
In this game you know there's ups and downs
You know you lose some, you know you win some
Got to stay prepared for when the drought come
Ball hard enough, that's when the scout come
And my man told x niggas out, by any means, just like Malcolm

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
I'm a bitter nigga strapped with a four four
Speedload extra bullets, that's an encore
My niggas trap with the mac, get your mind dwarf
Treat it like the corner bar, do shots in it
We don't lease cars, we don't drive rentals
Put the cash down, then we hop in it
Yo ho hot, just like an oven
I don't hit her stop and she give me top in it
New era, ball fitted, I'm a real nigga, authentic
Got that seven 50, six 50 that panamera and they all kidding
Got Gotti beat, we all in it, foreign trips, we all did it
We for real, while y'all frauds with it
Y'all rap about it while we [?] the streets
We Master P, we bought it bought it
I hitch ho, while you thought about it
I lean back, just a plot of knowledge
She give me brains, she a fucking geek
Before I ever ever touched a beat
Flipped a birds tree cop three times a week
Moved a rock way before I met Jay and Bleek
Graduated from the streets that's hood college
