[Intro: Young Chris]
Uh, chea, Young Chris
Lost so many homies to this game
Our father, chea
Ride for you, die for you niggas, get high wit you niggas
Split pies wit my niggas, body get hard, souls touch the sky
Till the numbers get gone, I gotta shut my eyes, why

[Verse 1: Young Chris]
Is they with me or against me?
How these pussies gon convince me to start and don't follow up
I touch my other kids followers
My mom proud of us plus I love the green with in God we trust
My momma stuck so she don't care bout them killin' her
And how could I beef with them, him, him or her
You motherfuckers better recognize
Everybody got burners, the first that draw
The opposite the next to die
That's how it go that ain't just how I flow
I still live in the ghetto, that's how I know
In the hood everyday while you dudes eatin' good everyday
My momma workin' but the bills take out food everyday
Got the bench and a daughter though
Since the ten step pops did since her water broke
That nigga got like a dub and did a dime
Came home and my moms did a [?]

[Chorus: Young Chris]
As I walk through the north of death
They souls gone but they voices left
They talk to me every chance they get
I gotta make it for the chance they miss
Shit we all don't get a chance like this
It's hard livin' homie more than music
C & Neef dawg who you got us confused with
True shit we bout to do it, Neefy don't lose it
Follow the flow homie like you follow the blueprint

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
I wake up and ask the lord to forgive us
Till I die put my balls over bitches
But I can't put my balls over business
Cause I hate to go blind when, soon as I go to trial
Be my boy as a witness
Shit I'm just another bull with the riches
Tryna keep my momma cool give her more while I'm livin'
Rhymin' cool but it ain't what I expected
It's 'fuck you' if you ain't what they expectin'
They love you when you givin' them records (gotta respect it)
Just to get father's blessed with, if ya'll ain't impressed with the shit I do, I give her the rest shit
But promotion, If I get what the rest get, how could niggas neglect it
Niggas respect the shit is a method, lean, 19, givin niggas broad day and night scenes
Puttin niggas on stretchers, nigga Peem, whole team got beams
Sure you niggas be wet up, we got pistols forever, shit is just gettin' better

[Chorus: Young Chris]
As I, as I walk through the north of death
They souls gone but they voices left
They talk to me every chance they get
I gotta make it for the chance they miss
Shit we all don't get a chance like this
It's hard livin' homie more than music
C & Neef dawg who you got us confused with
True shit we bout to do it, Neefy don't lose it
Follow the flow homie like you follow the blueprint

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
It's funny how bitches used to say he a loser
Now people say he's the future
Now I got to stay in my groove
Cause I hate to fuck around and
And fuck around and it be my face on the news
Momma been through enough of the pain so I'ma move her
But I ain't movin' till I got enough of the game
Man these dudes better up up the game
The hood love us, it ain't nothin' to start from the musclin' gang
No disrespect I love my niggas to death
Cause in the Roc it ain't about who spit it the best
And plus we way different from rest
You got a show, I'm rollin' out
It ain't about who gettin' a check
I'ma roll till the wheels fall off, keep rollin oh you will fall off
You ain't official they will clip you
Teflon don extended, both nickels
Bang bang blockin, pistol poppin'

[Chorus: Young Chris]
As I, as I walk through the north of death
They souls gone but they voices left
They talk to me every chance they get
I gotta make it for the chance they miss
Shit we all don't get a chance like this
It's hard livin' homie more than music
C & Neef dawg who you got us confused with
True shit we bout to do it, Bucky don't lose it
Follow the flow homie like you follow the blueprint

[Outro]
Rest in peace L-Eazy, rest in peace O-Reddy, rest in peace A.L
Rest in peace my nigga Douba, rest in peace
It's hard livin' homie more than music, who you got us confused with
We bout to do it, don't lose it
Follow the flow homie like you follow the blueprint
