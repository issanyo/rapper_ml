[Papoose]
You get fucking popped with stomach shots
Your safest haven is the place you blazin', ya face degradin, ya fate is fadin'
When you made arraignment you made a statement you 'sposed to be a green hater bangin'
A house arrest with a ankle bracelet
It's a blatant shame when your body hit the ground so hard when we blaze the raven
You break the pavement and taste the basement
