[Intro: Rediroc]
In it for the long run, haha!
Yeah, look, look, look

[Verse 1: Rediroc]
Rediroc, on a level you could never reach
Goin' off for my boys till' they set them free
Whole "P" of sour D, you know I sell it cheap
Real nigga, no lie, bury me a "G"
I'm in the front seats, I fly first class
I'm so far gone, I can't turn back
Respect isn't given, you gotta earn that
A hard head is the first place you learn at
Roll the loud and we burn that
Let me see you work it baby, drop it where the floor at
Do it for the money like you tryna keep your lights on
If he ain't a rat then he most likely Python
Bitch, I ball hard like LeBron and his first ring
Nigga been ready since the day my momma birthed me
I just want a big booty girl for my birthday
Sounding like Maliah; long hair and a pretty face
Lets go!

[Chorus: Rediroc]
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
I just wanna get faded, drink Ciroc and get wasted
All this money I'm makin', reason why they keep hatin'

[Verse 2: Rediroc]
Go to work, this is part two
You can smell the YSL on me when I walk through
Any time you double what you spend, that's a smart move
AK-47 hit a nigga like Harpoon
All goons in my gang, everybody on go
All these diamonds on my chain hangin' from my torso
Had a "36" but I just let "4" go
2 dumb blinds and they wanna shoot a porno
Lets go!

[Chorus: Rediroc]
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
I just wanna get faded, drink Ciroc and get wasted
All this money I'm makin', reason why they keep hatin'

[Bridge: Young Chris]
New LeBrons, Spikes on the (?) or the Louboutins
Huh? I do this ma, watch me

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
Who the fuck wanna do it? Your boy get to it
Money May; Undisputed, be damned if I lose it
Bitch I'm lit; no tint, how dare you confuse it
Bitch, I said I'm lit, how dare you refuse it
I don't do it for the honey's, I do it for the money
Make sure my rainy day stay sunny
Young Rasheed; top seed
Handle the rock like Kyrie (?)

[Chorus: Rediroc]
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Do it for the money, do it for the money (lets go)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
Go to work, go to work, go to work (let me see you)
