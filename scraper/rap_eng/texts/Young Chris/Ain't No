[Verse 1 - Young Chris]
I keep it fresher than the next bitch, yes I
VVS's in your necklace, she fly
I make the next bitch see the exit, she gon
In other words she can be my x bitch
[?] hers for us, every time we fuck she get a rush
She can't get enough, back to back she get a nut
Shawty's swag drip, broke niggas can't bag this
No Michelle, just Chanel for my bad bitch
Big engines, big Benzs
If she walker, she walking in six inches
She ain't playing bout her fitness
Young bad bitch about our business
Put in work and she transport work, she get busy
Baddest little bitch in my city
She ain't the type that's gon go through a divorce and take the cars
She gon stand tall and take the charge

[Hook - ??]
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one could fuck you better)
Sleeps around, but he gives me a lot
(Keep you in diamonds and leather)
Friends are telling me I should leave you alone
(Aha, aha
Tell the freaks to find
A man of their own [x3])

[Verse 2 - Young Chris]
Niggas they ain't as fly as this, no lie
Can't do it as hot as this, they try
North Philadelph, I be that young nigga C
Niggas can't dance they tell them bum bitches leave

[Verse 3 - Lee Mazin]
What up C, just keep me laced in the illest mix
Bring Rosado, Coco Chanel with a rhyme smell
Back in the day, was a buck in the villy
He scooped me up, taught me well, cuz the dope was realer
I'm talking part of blue rock and wear suits and all that
The all white nikes, but the Guccis all black
And I was too young, telling you to fall back
You caught my mind [?], I'm telling you call back
But now I'm riding harder than Keish in Belly
With my little deuce deuce bricks up in the telly
Now it's custom made with the Burton shades
Snake skin by the order, how my purse is made
And then we sip champagne, eating sushi mayne
Smoothies in Jacuzzis, blow L's while you do me
That's bout shit
And back when Big was rocking Coogi sweaters
Them other niggas couldn't do me better
So I just let them lames go, had to let them lames know
The product of your name
We [?] a night and then we back on the plane
Back to the money, get the paper, stacking it slow
Do mother chicks is other chicks and now I'm letting em know

[Hook]
