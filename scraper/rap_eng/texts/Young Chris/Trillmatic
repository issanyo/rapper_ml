[Verse 1]
Different type dance when he rhyming
Black Mamba, Kobe or De'anthony Thomas
I'm back at it, bad bitch right in the waist
Blackmatic, hitting niggas right in the face
First 48 somebody is giving tips off
Leaving every shell you tell we giving clips off
Wing and hawking, everyday that thing is popping
They can't resist us, go to clubs and bring the flock in
Load the stock in, Act up we pull a stock out
Get to plotting, get to drop the inner flock out
I keep a 40 in my 34s
Strapped twice when you fuck around with these dirty whores
They got 970, need 30 more
Get out of line with mines, and Imma murder yours
Big daddy, kain baby I serve the raw
Bo Jack, Thurman thomas, wearing that 34
Never heard before, Philly niggas they know the boy
The biggest artillery when we go to war
Niggas dropping, kind of weird to go to stores
Bitch ain't wearing painted memories when they go to draw
Never DOA, bank roll at BOA
They tell me gunna keep coming, you gon see your day
I tell my mama and daughter that it's gon be okay
It's better this than locked down in BOA nigga
Never fold, they suck dick to sell they soul
And mix it up and switch it up when they tell they hoes
I was 19 wearing platinum and selling gold
16 nigga seen it in me, tell em ho!
(God that's so deep, 16!)
They can see I'm hot, now your bitches is on the yacht
I'm loving this cuz not niggas was on the block
Selling rocks, ducking cops, and thugging shots
They tell me gunna let's get it, I'll turn it up a notch
Keep the fiends coming, keep pushing, that dream coming
Long as [?] fans talked in that mean something
Let me get the drop, niggas dead, I swear to god
You pump fair, you punk queer, prepare to die
Fuck y'all snitches, y'all girls is our business
Fuck try and go get nigga, and die richer
Y'all shook, take a page out our book
We standing over the stove till our heart cooks
This is small rook, suit and tie cigar look
Fresh fitted, promoters calling, I'm all booked
Until we win, I'm all in, that's how I ride
I get it in till they dig it in, bitch I'm alive
