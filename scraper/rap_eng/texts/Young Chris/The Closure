[Verse 1]
Out on the strip with no fear
You niggas wouldn't come near
Been in this bitch for some years
New niggas couldn't compare
K47 in possession
Shit that'll knock down a bear
Ringing their bell we be giving them hell
If catch them in jail you'll get knocked into [?]
Big bulldog with a clutch [?]
How a nigga feeling when the trust gone
Can't get caught up with the [?] hands
Man you niggas better watch what you puff on
When that shit start hopping out the AK
Niggas taking shit down nigga mayday
Man I hop on these beats for my dawgs in the streets
To the cells I'mma send them that J pay
Big bank roll in my cargos
Ride fleet ship looking like a car show
[?] hit the streets nigga shining
Forty four millimeter no diamonds
[?] fly shit with my espy
Gold buckle all on my Giuseppes
Brought the whole crew down to fountain blue
You better hide your boo we on them jet skis
Stay above water, rich like Porter
A nigga dial him for the quarter
Can't come short got to have every penny straight cause every dollar for my daughter
I'm at the border main for my snorter mains I take a trip out to Florida
A couple gallons main of that [?] main [?] water
Young nigga on so they want to fuck now
Get a new watch get this shit busted down
Out in California fucking with Jaccpot
Got a couple zips so a nigga touchdown
See who tough now when them niggas rush down
And kick in your door bitch you better hush down
Bitch I keep my shit loaded up with enough rounds
I put on for my city I rep for my town
We gon' lay them niggas down main
Down main, got an ak and a four pound main
[?] on the beach a whole quarter in the streets
Got a judge take your life sit 'em down main
Can't stop won't stop get down main
We don't love these hoes we love the pound main
We like Snoop and Daz we like to rough it up, trying to fuck us up right now main
Where them hoes at, bring them girls in
If she fucking the world cause she fucking it up with her girlfriends
Crack that 'tron open, you got weed then curl it then
I got Hennessy I got plenty weed a nigga drunk as fuck and I'm in them trees
I got a drumstick hanging out the oozie
Get you pussy niggas wetter than Jacuzzi
I got extra clips for the extra scrips and finna check the strip and make a movie
Cold lawyer just to bump the case
Cartridges for more coffin space
Forensic files more caution tape
Hold you niggas down take it off the waist murder murder
Murder swear its murder when we catch them
Got them choppers coppers and I'm running down [?]
Murder I swear to God I want revenge
And I won't rest until they dead I put this shit on all my friends
