[Verse 1: Jahlil Beats]
I'm getting money on these lame niggas
You runnin round broke, that's a shame nigga
Boy you lookin at the hottest in the game nigga
See me getting to the money and the fame nigga
30 racks on me, I'm about to ball
2 good coupes and I did it for my dawgs
2 bad bitches and they bout to suck it up
Young nigga in the flesh and I want it all
Fly nigga, I get plenty hoes
Hear these niggas talkin money, I got plenty dough
And these niggas hittin on me, I got plenty though
And these flamers that I'm makin, I got plenty mo
Take a look into my eyes, you can see the best
Fat bitch, all between her thighs, shawty you a mess
Rollie on, you can see the time flyin in the jet
When it's up we can talk money, nigga where the check

[Hook: Jahlil Beats]

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
All a nigga know before we had shows
Benny, Jigga and X, money cash hoes
Dalla told me to flex on you assholes
Henny Philly bitches with sex, we done had those
Made in America, winger hawk in the corner
6's but I fuck with the Metz, cool with the owner
True that you lil bitches did it, you know the karma
Fuck me if you wanna, just gonna
Gangstas disown you like shit, takin the whole 36
Burnin niggas like fuck around with a dirty bitch
Pussy nigga was mouthin off at the 35th
First I heard he was talkin, next thing I heard he hit
Raw fuck up the plot, you know my birdie shit
Standin pretty shot in the block, nice 30 brick
So many niggas from the block murder shit
We be thrownin screamin and shooters, we ain't heard shit
Yall ain't heard this shit, I got a tux with a perfect fit
Brand new casket and a hearse with
I got shooters for long distance like Dirk with it
Youngins tryna live my life, finish rehearsing it
