I gotta get you outta my head
And in my bed, baby

[Hook - JJ Daniels]
Make your way into the crib
Don't be shy, there's no one here
Follow me into a room
Ain't no telling what we'll do
Just me and you
Ain't no telling what we'll do

[Verse 1 - Young Chris]
Just you and I
Apple Jack, New Jack, G Money style
Got a stone in her wrist worth 20 thou
Yeah, CB, I chuck the deuces
Til my next, we're never loving the deuces
I was blessed with a young thing
Met me in the city
I'll keep it secret if you let me in your Vickie's
Just you and I here, ain't no eyes here
Everything private til we fly Lear
Shake that ass in the mirror
Going to the club, tight-fitting dress
Time to come up out of that..
Like the way it's fitting like the bed when it's soft
You gonna love the way I'm hitting, ah!

[Hook - JJ Daniels]
Make your way into the crib
Don't be shy, there's no one here
Follow me into a room
Ain't no telling what we'll do
Just me and you
Ain't no telling what we'll do

[Verse 2 - Young Chris]
Kevin McAllister, no one here
Go with a higher caliber, they nowhere near
Get it poppin in there
Throw em all over like a cop in the rear
Have em locked in the bed
Yeah, skipping the kissing, kissing
Your kitten. Switching positions
Stick the key in ignition
And she ride until she run out of gas
And she a spurter, so literally
She cumming out fast
Put my palm on that ass, turn that
Waist back around. Before I come she
Turn her face back around
Say I tell that her lay down
Open your thighs, til that boy go
Back inside
