[Intro:]
Shout the academy

C west waddup?
We go hit the box off and see what this movie end like
Ha ha ha ha
Cannon

[Verse 1:]
Taking one day to feed ma hunger
All around with a 40 with 30 extension under
Gunner from the winter to the summer
I'll be balling in ma KD's made it through the thunder
Streets watching seek out the D popping
I'm a fighter nigga home of Danny Swift and B Hopkins
Opportunity ass niggas they see options
They jump ships, I see them flopping
Fuck nigga duck nigga you see me chopping
I'm coming here ma footstep I know you hear me knocking

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2:]
Uh uh uh
Adolescent mama said I had it stressing
Where i'm from 21 is a blessing
To the top i'm destined baby Glock your weapon
Seper when i'm repping this chopper in ma possession
Shells in they fleshing shooters like the western
Ready to put in work all day like the mexican, flexican
Clove standing over the stove gotta stretch again
Coby never ate with the from I finest the way
Story to tell there's a lot more to me
And if you ever front there's a shell from yours truly mother blah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3:]
Uh stress taking a toll still i'm playing this role
From a boy to a man now to the end of the road
Gimmie head end of the shows
R&B divas fucking all the industry hoes
Keep it loaded know I gotta throw it if I expose it
Placing deals outside of tha music this gotta close it
Left a few bad vices of mine gotta stay focused
Evil gotta stay strapped so ma guess gotta stay closest
I'm a G bitch see bitch shoot for the stars
I bring the party to me cupid bitches cupid cigars
Hair out wear it out without diamonds i'm a boss nigga
Floss nigga without shining mother fucka

[Outro:]
