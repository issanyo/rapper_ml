[Verse 1: The Game]
Wake up in the morning feeling like a G
Got them number fours on my feet
And the Lakers just beat the Heat
Clippers beat the Knicks, think it's about to be a good week
Yeah I'm rich forever, you know I got them good seats
Now let's hit up Greystone, get our fuckin' Ace one
Know I'm in the VIP, throwin' back straight 'tron
Goons with me 'case we gotta get our fuckin' ape on
Nigga playin' Superman, better have that cape on
My niggas pop up outta nowhere, State Farm
But I'm cool, and Orator play them Drake songs
And bring it back to the west side, play them Nate songs
Cause little mama know, we’re only in here for one night
A week though, and watch out for them wolves
Dressed up in them sheep clothes
And she don’t really club, but I bet that ass a freak though

[Chorus: Sam Hook (The Game)]
We’re only in here for one night (a week though)
We’re only in here for one night (I said a week though)
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
You know your man he a fraud, I gotta have that
She want a bodyguard, I'll be her New Edition
She pray for Louboutins, must be her True Religion
Now I'm lookin' for Taraji and somebody with a body like Chyna
Chyna? The one from King of Diamonds who designed her
I call her Barbie, pink Ferraris on her birthday
And I'mma make sure every day is like the first day
She want another round, fuck her to another round
I don't just beat the pussy, I runs it to the ground
Every day another girl and another town
I don't just beat the pussy, I runs it to the ground

[Chorus: Sam Hook (The Game)]
We’re only in here for one night (a week though)
We’re only in here for one night (I said a week though)
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
Sunday night, Grey Stone, neck full of gray stones
Staring at the crowd, trying to see who I’ma take home
Game said "straight 'tron," I be on that champagne
Bitches all around us, trying to watch us do the damn thang
Shouts out to Joey Crack, chicks like, "oh he back"
Welcome to my house party, OG, roll it back
Blow it if he showin' that, keep a few loaded gats
Bitch niggas showin' out, real niggas notice that
California lifestyle, fuckin' with my nigga Chuck
?, Young Chris, nigga what, all we know is get to it
Stack high live it up, fuckin' with that Grey Stone
Everybody get 'em up, yeah

[Chorus: Sam Hook (The Game)]
We’re only in here for one night (a week though)
We’re only in here for one night (I said a week though)
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron
