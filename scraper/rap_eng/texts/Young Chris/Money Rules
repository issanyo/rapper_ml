[Intro:]
Huned Thou just on the Jewels [all we about]
Big yatch live on a cruise
White floors kick off your shoes
Big bank you know that money rules
[Cannon cannon]
Cheap niggas pouring out
We bring that fucking [?] so we blowing out
Dry clean, no shoes
Ya'll niggas come prepared this here about to ooohz

[Verse 1:]
Watch the power of root of evil it change you
I throw a hustle i never thought entertainer
Nothing can't hold me not even a detainer
Since death is unexpected I leave it up in the chamber
Prolling on that Lala living that a mellow life
Jordan bunnies raining yellow ice
Ma niggas in the base say it's hella nice
She got one chance to slip I never tell her twice
Thought he was dead huh, tell em that boy alive
Have ma carpet laid out when I arrive
Too much pride I can never lose my drive
I'm ma own boss nigga I can never lose my job
Boutique size, love ma bitches with thick thighs
When that heat rise all you niggas get deep fried
The weak die for you niggas to feed
I highly underrated soon niggas will see why

[Chorus:]
Huned Thou just on the Jewels
Big yatch live on a cruise
White floors kick off your shoes
Big bank you know that money rules
Cheap niggas pouring out
We bring that fucking towing so we blow it out
Dry clean, no shoes
Ya'll niggas come prepared this here about to ooohz

[Verse 2:]
They stand around me mugged i'm there to perform
Star 24/7 I know what i'm doing
Destined for greatness mo fucka in know where i'm going
Living outa ma luggage hoe I know when it's on
New money you can't tell hoe
I'm like a teen with that fresh outa Jail glow
Low and a snap fitted Diesel and shell toe
Smoke behind a tent too much wind make ma L blow
Oh man I say here it's a brighter day here
Easy 50K work for stones in this bouquet wear
Tuck your little pistols, homie got a K here
Homie bring them gangster niggas them niggas don't play fair
You'll be gone a day here whatever you seen at
All they wanna know is who they aiming this machine at
Wherever the fiends at fuck this shit we product here
Gotta hustle hard to get ma family the fuck outa there

[Chorus]
