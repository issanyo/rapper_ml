[Verse 1: Young Chris]
This brand new machine
Now it's time to turn these nightmares into dreams
You can watch me on the screen
Watch me on the screen, got that product for the fiends
All the niggas say he's dope, all the bitches make 'em scream
Shoot official, got that pistol for the distance got my beam
For the dirty stickup kids, put 'em in his wig, you make a scene
Home of the birdies, will you get 'em for the team?
We gets dirty, but our VVS is clean
They say that boy frequent fly without the wings
Stupid niggas, y'all remind me of Mr. Bean
These others rappers ain't good as they make 'em seem
Type to get cut, never picked, don't make the team
Here's to all the niggas that played me, no BDS
Should've freed the rest, you see this tech you seeing death

[Hook: Young Chris]
I'm alive, taking my time, one day at a time
Where you live by, you die by the spray of the nine
You can hate on the player, can't hate on the grind
Through time, you niggas see why I rhyme
Bitch, I'm alive, better than ever, told 'em never say never
This return of the hustler, they never could dead us, I'm alive
Like I never could die, what you niggas surprised?
Niggas, death is yours, I'm still alive, niggas

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
I ain't dead, death taking a toll on momma
Tired of y'all niggas, sick of these hoes with the drama
The ones that did make it stand in front of your honor
Try to assassinate my character, young Obama
Marijuana, sweet aromatics for the ganja
My 38 in navigation,  it ain't hard to find you
Back on that back block with gas cock and crack rock and mad pot
Young bitches party sucking dick while taking back shots
Fucking all the whores and in they slot, hit the jackpot
Once the door close, ain't no open, put the padlock
No clowns allowed here, hit 'em while the crowd there
Fuck cops, they wild here, you couldn't walk a mile here
Death to all posers, the realest come to exposure
Let's bring closing to these niggas, the takeover, D1

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
More clips to share, know you niggas ain't fair
The desert eagles come in pairs, we catch them anywhere
Everybody get air, take all them niggas over there
We focus on the road, ain't worried about the rare
We don't fuck with the stare, we worry about the chair
Ain't worried about you police hating on a nigga
We worry about the codis breaking on a nigga
From sun up to sun down, we known to tote that gun'round
Smarter niggas walk up leaving niggas don't found
Dig a whole, we let it roll, hear that drum sound
Tell our fathers to try and run down

[Hook]
