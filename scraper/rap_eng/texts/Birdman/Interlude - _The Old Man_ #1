Find me in another town, doin' like it's my town
5 star G homie anywhere I leave my crown
Burnin' with a few bitches

Boss hog new nigga thats a whale to these new fishes
So we chill at the hotel

And that's just my thing
Goin' straight to the bank
And how we work that thing, you know the game brings money over bitches
And bitches over money
Them hoes chasin' so them niggas keep runnin'
Back to my saddle homie
Mils and pounds on him
Uptown crown see the number above the bitches?
See we live above the heights
Do it under the lights
We do it so bright (so bright)
Like picked tomato
Ripe picked tomato
Make your head a tomato
BITCH

Jet black helicopter
You know I got that other chopper

Complete a mission on em
One of a kind sky high that's how we gettin' it on em
Got the money though

You know we trippin' when we tear the whole mall down
It's big money homie this is how we shut it down
Yeah nigga we sip, to dip
Dip on this money as we, chase and flip
Higher than high life
Thats just another sight
Put it in your life
That's just another flight

Mashed the whole gas nigga get it till your good
See, I play it for the hood
Got it out the hood and a nigga ain't full
