[Hook: Caskey]
We gon' get it popping, that's 4 sho'
Standing on the couch and screaming mo'
Knew it'd be this bad when I was 4
I just bought a Sprite and poured myself a 4
People do a lot of things 4 show
Don't know who the real ones and who got to go, yeah
We gon' get it popping, that's 4 sho'
Standing on the couch and screaming mo'

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Hell yeah, that's 4 sho'
I just popped my two bands, might have to pop me two mo'
Know if rap don't work out, I'll go back to selling dro'
I would tell her who I is, but know she already know, yeah, go
People said I wouldn't prosper
I'm laughing at 'em, I got money like a stripper locker
All the times I got the pills, they ain't from the doctor
She come around this way and you might have to watch her, yeah

[Hook: Caskey]
'cause we gon' get it popping, that's 4 sho'
Standing on the couch and screaming mo'
I'm with the Birdman like we got the blow
And we gon' get it popping, that's 4 sho', yeah

[Bridge: Caskey]
I'm on so much pills that I can't po' enough
Like I'm with the gang, we gon' throw it up
Seem like all my haters never showing up

[Verse 2: Caskey]
Bitch, don't even try me 'cause you know what's up
Keep Pushin' the squad and we going up
I might be the president, I'm so corrupt
Rolling up my sleeves while my bitches rolling up
That's the way it got to go

[Hook: Caskey]
We gon' get it popping, that's 4 sho'
Standing on the couch and screaming mo'
With the Birdman like we got the blow
We gon' get it popping, that's 4 sho'

[Verse 3: Birdman]
We got this money off the flo'
We kept them thangs and switched the dope
Came through bossing with some mo'
These niggas popping off like some hoes
Flame game, it just change thangs
And we did thangs and then switched lanes
And we played the game and we got the chain
And these niggas dippin' and we ducked the Range
And we move them thangs out to new thangs
These pussies know that we propane
Got it, nigga, then we flipped it, nigga
Then we came back in them new thangs
Get money, nigga
Size me up, it's guaranteed you lose
You play with me, Hot Beezo flipping shoes
Me and Caskey flipping hoes by the twos
Disrespect and we bustin' brains for food
Blatt!

[Bridge: Caskey]
I'm on so much pills that I can't po' enough
Like I'm with the gang, we gon' throw it up
Seem like all my haters never showing up
Yeah, that's how it go

[Hook: Caskey]
We gon' get it popping, that's 4 sho'
Standing on the couch and screaming mo'
Knew it'd be this bad when I was 4
I just bought a Sprite and poured myself a 4
People do a lot of things 4 show
Don't know who the real ones and who got to go, yeah
We gon' get it popping, that's 4 sho'
Standing on the couch and screaming mo'
