[Lil Wayne]
I like my pussy a little wetter, my drinks a little colder
My girls a little older with her hair past her shoulders
Like my weed a little stronger, my money a lot longer
If Blooding ain't right than I couldn’t be a wronger
I’m a bad motherfucker, be very afraid
Boy this heat'll give your ass a raspberry beret
Been in the building, motherfucker, we ain't never escape
Cash money is the Army, Veterans day
The block had got hotter, the World had got colder
So fuck a diamond chain, we wearing guns on our shoulder
If you want it you can get it, come and sign up
We got choppers that will put that Tony Romo 9 up
Man we so fuck about it, 5-star: count it
Could have fucked the world, but I left it how I found it
Took the game to school now I’m 'bout to cap and gown it
Got a circle of success, you can say I’m well-rounded

Yeah, and by the way my name is Tunechi

[Birdman]
Uptown roller, take it off your shoulder
Tommy’s with the flag, spent the hundred high-rolling
Flipped it off the condo, made it off the corner
Sky scraping condo, top floor aroma
High to the sky when I step up in this bitch
Thousand dollar cologne, no ceiling in this bitch
The marble for the Louie, the bag full of cash
Keep a strap on me, a mill on the tab
Priceless with these numbers, flipping in the seat
Junior doing time, kicking up his feet
A mill on the books, I’m stunting with a fleet
A pretty red bitch we smash every week
Blowing on some good Maybach back seat
The bitch sleeping good, a mill on the sheets
Born rich from the hood YMCMB
Yeah Maybach, brrrap!

[Rick Ross]
I’m that fat motherfucker, young entrepreneurs
Zombies in the street we got them pouring out the sewers
Most controversial and the motherfucking truest
And by looking at my jewels Im still the motherfucking coolest
Waving your flag, you just a fucking blood donor
And this bitch far from bad, who put these fucking Uggs on her?
Took her to California, spent a fucking dub on her
When she walk up in the club now every fucking thug want her
I’m just so fucking special, let's see what's on the menu
Fuck the promoter, my crib bigger than the venue
This the shit I'm into, all-black in the rental
My chopper be making hits: it's such a sad instrumental
These niggas little boys, enjoying their little toys
I’m building hotels off the coast of St. Croix
100 mill, I accept nothing less
Black Ray Bans at Obama’s next address
