[Intro: Birdman]
Make it so fresh, YM
So fly so priceless, CMB bitch
Just another day on the
Top floor of the balcony bitch
Live it how we live it
Mula, Drizzy
You what it is, young appreciate that
It's big money poppin baby boy
Ain't none of that lil biddy
More, mo more milli
More, mo more milli
Yeah...

[Verse 1: Birdman]
It's pearl white candy paint job fly
Big timer on the loose
Got a bitch riding five
And everytime I pull up you know I'm iced up
When I step up in the club I light the bitch up
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint rally stripe shining like us
Pearly white maybach, hatchback automatic
Straps stash spots under the rack
Bitch, ready to spray that
Foreign grinds hard times
Getting mines, you know uptown
Big time doing time
You know, Harley Davis baby
Cash money is pay me so you pay me how it weigh
Baby, black, gold
100 mill off the floor
Never told now you know how it go bitch
One hundred, one hundred

[Verse 2: Drake]
Lord!
You're now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And black on black 62 float majestic
Me and Stunna in it, boy I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
It's about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank Me Later first week I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on until the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shawty, go ahead buss it open
I keep a secret baby, nothing's heard when nothing's spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Have confused all the conversations between y'all
And dog that's funny, pay me what owe me nigga
All cash money

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Yeah!
Boy it's that big body nigga in his big-bodied car
Got a big body boppa with that million-dollar drawer
She said "Daddy I like sushi", so baby take me raw
I pulled out my strapped condom, looked down said "naw!"
Cigar full of kush, you need prescriptions to access
Laying on a mattress, with your favourite actress
My flow is going out, I said baby pass the matches
And let her top me off while I'm tapping off the ashes
Classy but classless, you danced off the guest-list
A lady here but said it, nigga get past it
Take it what you've got, you should've passed it
You was moving slower than molasses, it's time you were nasty
Give it up too, it's a jack, don't move
This is murder music, nigga don't disturb this groove
Too trill with the team, Cash Money ?
We true players down to the last chromosome
