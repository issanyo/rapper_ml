[Intro: Birdman]
Got my lil nephew Que with me

[Hook: Jacquees]
Yeaah, Aye ima tell you how it really go
These wise words from the youngin
I got the knowledge, I was honor roll
Can't fuck with shawty she too vunerable
You play your roll let's see how far you go
And I gotta Stunna on the defense
It be that nigga that ain't honorable

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Can't you see me, can't you see me
These diamonds on me really gleaming
I'm on the henny I ain't leanin
I step out cleaner that a deacon
I know these niggas probably watching me
You jack my swag, I know you copy me
Money through with you lil niggas
So I can't see you niggas stopping me
And please don't turn down the mood
We know these niggas jealous, and they acting cool
I done ran out of old hunnids, I back spendin my blues
And I'm lost at sea on a yatch and my plus my rolex a pool
And then I stack my money longer than you
Ooh..

[Hook: Jacquees]
Yeaah, Aye ima tell you how it really go
These wise words from the youngin
I got the knowledge, I was honor roll
Can't fuck with shawty she too vunerable
You play your roll let's see how far you go
And I gotta Stunna on the defense
It be that nigga that ain't honorable

[Birdman]
You know nephew, when these pussies act like pussies, we gotta play'em like pussies
If I dont make money, it don't make sense
On my mommas soul boy, on my mommas soul

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Early with this money, got a couple of them hundreds
Running down with them numbers
Know we bout them numbers, we did it nigga for them numbers
Got hit niggas with no numbers, nigga went to court and he g'd up and ain't say nothing bout numbers
Get money hungry, money hungry

[Hook: Jacquees]
Yeaah, Aye ima tell you how it really go
These wise words from the youngin
I got the knowledge, I was honor roll
Can't fuck with shawty she too vunerable
You play your roll let's see how far you go
And I gotta Stunna on the defense
It be that nigga that ain't honorable

[Verse 3: Jacquees]
I done messed up the game
Show me that pussy baby
Show me you ain't afraid
Birdman doing numbers and lil bitch I'm doing the same
It's fyb I want the money and my niggas feeling the same
And put some respect on the game

[Hook: Jacquees]
Yeaah, Aye ima tell you how it really go
These wise words from the youngin
I got the knowledge, I was honor roll
Can't fuck with shawty she too vunerable
You play your roll let's see how far you go
And I gotta Stunna on the defense
It be that nigga that ain't honorable
