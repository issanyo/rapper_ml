​[Pre-Hook]
Real nigga doing real G shit
Jiggy nigga with a jiggy bitch
Rich nigga actin' like he Richie Rich
Pretty nigga with a pretty bitch

[Hook]
Every real nigga in the building, nigga, step in
I keep Xans, Corvettes, and automatic weapons
Every real nigga in the building, start reppin'
This nigga 'bout to blow up like 9/11
If you a real nigga, step in

[Verse 1]
Played on Nintendo, now I get bands movin' Contra
Just because your nigga and me on the same Accord don't mean both of us got a Honda
The O's in my account got commas, X the hoes in my bed got the same amount of condoms
I put on for my town, and there ain't no off switch
I'm a green monster, shout out to niggas at Fenway
Still sleepwalkin', shout out to M.A
What the TV say, I do it like MJ
I'm a young Marc Jacobs, your money is too, because that shit can't get straight
I'm the devil's son, that should tell you that Prada loves me
Beamer, Benz, Bentley, Challenger, or Camaro, that Impala ugly
Dominican flows through my blood, I'm Big Papi O, G
Guess I'm a 3-1 lead, Cali bitches love to blow me

​[Pre-Hook]
Real nigga doing real G shit
Jiggy nigga with a jiggy bitch
Rich nigga actin' like he Richie Rich
Pretty nigga with a pretty bitch

[Hook]
Every real nigga in the building, nigga, step in
I keep Xans, Corvettes, and automatic weapons
Every real nigga in the building, start reppin'
This nigga 'bout to blow up like 9/11
If you a real nigga, step in

[Verse 2]
My braggadocio gettin' the best of me
Some niggas just get popped like a quiz if they testin' me
They say two wrongs don't make a right
Then why do they say I'm too wrong to be not right?
My mind's too wrong to not write
I do not write, my car's nice
Don't cop ice, I shopped white
Run from, cop lights
These LA niggas, my ese's like apartheid
Thinkin' out loud, I'm a legend, that's a thought, right?
Forget my watch like, my whole arm's tight
Fuck the IRS, they won't free Ross, why?
But listen to Kenny, you gon' be alright
Bump "Black Beatles", when we hit the spotlights
What niggas do for my bars, they'd do for Klondikes
Easy to say, I'm God, right?
