Woo! Know what I'm sayin'?
(Lil' whoadie 'bout that action)
Get money, fuck hoes
(Lil' whoadie 'bout that action)
Action, cash
(Lil' whoadie 'bout that action)
(Lil' whoadie 'bout that action)
Nigga playin' with my whoadie, I'ma ride
She say that that pussy wet so I'ma slide
She pull up and fuck the crew like she connivin'
Hey, I'ma cum all over her body

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Hopped out the passenger side with my strap
From 50 to 100, we movin' and serve that
We shinin' every summer, spend numbers and bounce back
Lil' whoadie 'bout that action, we pull up, it's 'bout that
When I came 'round, I put it down, on front line, I did mines
Hustle life, we built this, had a block bumpin' like a second line
Cut niggas, them crunch niggas, them projects were cut, nigga
Play around, you get cut, nigga, get pulled down, I won't cut, nigga
No lames, born rich and dangerous
High life and famous
Big MACs and them straps, nigga
Play around and get slashed, nigga

[Verse 2: Yung Ralph]
'73 Chevelle, put that shit together
Married to the money, yeah we live together
Love my F&N but still keep that Beretta
Made it to the top and I ain't use a ladder
Ran up a check, ran up a check (cash)
Pass that shit around, then I go collect
Made it out the hood, now I'm on TV
Posted with Young Thugger, sippin' GTV (vodka)
Smokin' on the headband, nigga, I'm a stoner
Went from hangin' on the corner to hangin' with owners
Yeah, it's the Juugman for niggas who don't know me (word)
I just did a feature, went and copped a Rollie

[Interlude: Young Thug]
(Yapper) Aye man, we really, we really haven't, a lot already around the spot, you know what I'm sayin'? Niggas down there, cause they, that's my blood, that's my slime fool. Fuck you mean?

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
NASCAR speed on 'em
I got bitches in the spot callin' me big homie
I'm bouncin' like a trampoline, homie
So in love with this cash, all my shows have the cream, homie
I'm bangin' red like strawberries
I told your bitch ain't goin' steady
My weed is loud and you smokin' libraries
I got a thing for that fetish
All my diamonds green like lettuce
And what you worth to me? Pennies
Let's get it
