[Intro: Young Thug]
Dun Deal, let's get it
Shoes up, brothers for life

[Hook]
No need to ties my shoes up
These boys ain't talkin' bout shit
Baby my ice way cooler
You can tell who get rich
Fuckboy get toast no strudel
Kill him then fuck his bitch
Eating that Ruth's Chris, no Luda
Paint a nigga like Maaco
Baby girl I am the boss, if I say so spray yo
Head down to your ankles
If you play with one of my bros or my pesos ayo
Thick bread like a bagel
Drinking tons of Maple with no Eggo ayo
And I’m set like centre no Staples

[Verse 1 : Young Thug]
Hey, ain't no cop, F your B, I dawg

Suck this dick just like Biatrice
That lil' bih done caught me dabbin', now she try to grab it
No T.I. bitch I'm a king, I'm magic like Don Juan
I'm still livin' sucka free and taking care of my moms
Turn that beat up, bitch I'm swagging

Bitches see me they can't act
And I appreciate all that
And I'm in front of you no captain
Wet you up just like a baptist, hey
