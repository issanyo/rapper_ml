[Keith Murray]
Yeah, turn me up, yo
Ayyo I'm like a lifeguard on the beat
When niggas try to rap, I come through and I save the track
I'm fresh like Mannie, fly like the Birdman
Won't waste my time, torch you in freak sand
I look at gettin Cash Money like a sport
Smoke a Newport, then finish yo ass with one thought
Niggas pop my collar for me when I flot
That's why in they cats money, oh no, say it ain't so!

[Mannie Fresh]
Double action pump, in the back of the trunk
And I'ma pop that bitch if you want the funk
And I down that ass, if you get out of line
Old school nigga with a new piece of ine
When I ucka-ucka flame
When I ucka-ucka aim, I'ma clear the whole parkin lot
Some ol' rusty ass, musty ass, always dusty ass
Busta ass nigga got shot (3 gun pops)

[Chorus: Jazze Pha] + (Baby)
I heard he snitchin on a playa man (say it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
I-smoke-dro (say it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Don't-smell-blow (say it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Rock-hundred-fo' (say it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Slam peller back do'

[Mikkey]
Money, power, I devour niggas every hour
Swallow my pain, I extort lanes for every dollar
Get change out of every coward
Listen, this is pimpin, this is game
This is flickin, this is flame, this is, none other than Mikkey
No lovin, no pity, no huggin, no kiss
Never raw, doggin a bitch
Never rat, cuz we killin the snitch
We hope to be rich, stay broke you's, dope for a fix (feel me, feel me, feel me)
I heard niggas wanna kill me (really?)
We thirsty for power, we hungry for cheddar
We gamble for mink, and scramble for leather (daamn!)
This is dope, put the fire to the hot spoon
Niggas hatin man prayin that they shot soon
Life ain't a joke, shit ain't even buyin soon

[Chorus: Jazze Pha] + (Baby)
I heard he snitchin on a playa man (say it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
I-smoke-dro (say it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Don't-smell-blow (say it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Rock-hundred-fo' (say it ain't so, say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
