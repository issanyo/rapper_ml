[Verse 1: Amira (Asami)]
Yeah, I got body for this
Yeah, see ya looking this way
(Anything I wanna got
And when I step into the spot
You got my girls, you make it hot
And when we move, you wanna watch like)
Yeah, we're just doing our thing

[Pre-Hook: Jess]
Out here on the street lights, after midnight
You know we'll be waiting
Shades on with my whole crew when we roll through
What street dreams are made of

Out here on the street lights, after midnight
You know we'll be waiting
Shades on with my whole crew when we roll through
Walk in like a bad man

[Hook]
Walk in like a bad man
Walk in like a bad man

[Verse 2: Shereen (All)]
Yeah, when we up in the club
Yeah, everyone show us love
(We don't pay a waiting line
It's on the house and when you're mine
Tell the fetch to let me ride
Singing 'bitch, don't kill my vibe')
Yeah, we'll be turning it up

[Pre-Hook: Jess]
Out here on the street lights, after midnight
You know we'll be waiting
Shades on with my whole crew when we roll through
What street dreams are made of

Out here on the street lights, after midnight
You know we'll be waiting
Shades on with my whole crew when we roll through

Walk in like a bad man

[Hook]
Walk in like a bad man
Walk in like a bad man

[Bridge: Shereen & Amira]
I know that I can, that's why I walk like a bad man
That's how we do, ready, I'm not coming for you
I know that I can, that's why I walk like a bad man
That's how we do, ready, I'm not coming for you

[Outro: Jess (Amira)]
Out here on the street lights, after midnight
You know we'll be waiting
Shades on with my whole crew when we roll through

(Walk in like a bad man)
