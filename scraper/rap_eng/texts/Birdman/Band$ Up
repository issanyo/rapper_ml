[Intro: 2Pac]
Hell nah, nigga if you ain't watched, I'm slowly coming up.(laughter)
I thought you knew?
Ask somebody, ask them, ask somebotay
This how it is...
I'm the type of muthafucka that gotta have my own
I got to hustle for my own, and any man out there got to feel me
It ain't about milking off the next man, that's a muthafucking hoe
I'm a muthafucking pimp. I'm finna come up on my own
Imma get my own sack
I don't wanna be nobody worker all my life. I want my own muthafucking kilo
You understand me?
So that's what I did. Chaka a hustler, and I'm a hustler
So everybody understand it
Ain't no one man gon' stand in one spot forever
That's a sucka!
I'm a hustler, imma come up
So I took what little bit he gave me, and doubled up, and doubled up, and double up, and I been doubling since
And I'm gon' keep doubling until these niggas kill me, and that's that
Can I get a blunt?

[Hook: Khalil w/ (Johnny Rain)]

[Verse 2: Khalil w/ (Johnny Rain)]

[Verse 2: Khalil w/ (Johnny Rain)]
Pull up to the club
And the valet knew what to do
(We did that huh)
Them niggas is mad
And the women lovin' the crew
(We did that huh)
Went from the bank to the club
And I made a deposit (Uh Huh)
We put on a CD right after we told 'em
We got it
(We did that)

[Bridge: Justin]
I ain't into stuntin'
But this song, I gotta show it
All that is money
