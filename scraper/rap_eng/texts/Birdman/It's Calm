[Intro: Sy Ari da Kid]
Yeah, miss me with all that noise
That bullshit no I ain't for it (You know)
It's calm, it's calm, we good, it's calm
I came in with my boys, left with your bitch, oh boy (Yeah yeah)
Its calm, its calm, we good its calm

[Verse 1: Sy Ari da Kid]
I'm up in the morning
Done with the yawning
I give a fuck if you tourin'
If that shit ain't come with a tour bus, yeah
And fuck all the warnings
We coughin, no worry
We got the juice
Juice don't know who cup imma pour it in
Im vibin' with someone daughter, they lie like they was supportin'
I never switch on my Whoadie
They snitchin' they 'Law and Order'
Im wishin' my niggas ballin'
From distance like Kemba Walker
My chick flew in from New Orleans
Just spent a zip on my barber
Im ridin' regardless
Im fly as a saucer
I fired some niggas then hired my momma
I lie to your honor
Shit I'm lying your honor
Figured out how to bring all them figures an look now on the FaceTime with Timbaland

[Hook: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Yeah, miss me with all that noise
That bullshit no I ain't for it you know
It's calm, it's calm, we good, it's calm
I came in with my boys, left with your bitch, oh boy
Its calm, its calm, we good its calm

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah we good, ain't no pressure, same old effort
We fly nigga change yo feather, ain't gon' let up, the game so extra, but they know better
Brand new whips, brand new seats, suede or leather
Aye young fella, play young fella, it's yo day young fella
We under the same umbrella, It ain't gonna rain forever
They gon' know my name forever
We can't stay the same forever
Stay rich with my gang forever
Some of us gon' be lame forever
Aye...These niggas be hatin', I be boolin'
Aye...Hop in the plane like a Uber
Aye...I play the game while you losin'
Yacht on the way and we cruisin'
Yacht on the way and we bruisin'

[Hook: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Yeah, miss me with all that noise
That bullshit no I ain't for it you know
It's calm, it's calm, we good, it's calm
I came in with my boys, left with your bitch, oh boy
Its calm, its calm, we good its calm

[Outro: Birdman]
