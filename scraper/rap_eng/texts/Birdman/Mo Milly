[Intro - Birdman]
Make it so fresh: YM
So fly, so priceless, CMB bitch
Just another day on the
Top floor of the balcony bitch
Live it how we live it
Mula, Drizzy
You what it is, young'un: appreciate that
It's big money popping baby boy
Ain't none of that lil biddy

[Hook]
More, m-more milly
More, m-more milly

[Verse 1 - Birdman]
Pearl-white candy paint job fly
Big Tymer on the loose
Got a bitch riding 5
And every time I pull up, you know I'm iced up
When I step up in the club I light the bitch up
Back on my saddle throwing purple out the truck
Candy paint, rally stripe, shining like us
Pearly white Maybach hatchback
Automatic straps, stash spots under the rack
Bitch, ready to spray that
Foreign grinds, hard times
Getting mines, you know: Uptown
Big time doing time
You know, Harley Davis baby
Cash money is who pay me so you pay me how it weigh, baby
Black gold, 100 mil off the floor
Never told now you know how it go bitch
One hundred, one hundred

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Drake]
You're now fucking with the most requested
The young nigga that everybody is so obsessed with
And black-on-black 62 float majestic
Me and Stunna in it, boy: I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
I'm about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank Me Later: first week, I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far-fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shorty, go ahead, bust it open
I keep a secret, baby: nothing's heard when nothing's spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Are all that fuels the conversations between y'all
And dogg that's funny; pay me what you owe me nigga
All cash money

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bun B]
Well it's that big body nigga and his big body car
Got a big body boppa with that million dollar jaw
She said: "daddy I like sushi, so give it to me raw!"
I pulled out my strap condom, looked down there and said "naw"
Cigar full of Kush you need prescriptions to access
Laying on the mattress with your favorite actress
My blunt was going out, I said "baby, pass the matches"
And let her top me off while I'm tapping off the ashes
Classic, but classless
You gassed up, but gasless
Unleaded, yeah. Bun said it, nigga get past it
Taking what you got, you should've passed it
You was moving slower that molasses
This time you were nasty
Give it up to him; it's a jack
Don't move! This is murder music, nigga
Don't disturb this room. 2 trill Ent Cash Money and October's Own
We true playas down to the last chromosome
