Asami:
My ceiling fan, I know it well
I lie awake and think of you
Next time I'll say, say something cool
Wait for the day that you want me

Jess with Shereen:
Staring at, at my phone, here in my bed
Wishing on all the words I never said
I keep on typing you these messages
Knowing that, that I won't ever hit send, I'm

All:
Sleepless in London, all I think about is you
My heart is breaking and I don't know what to do
Have you ever, ever felt like that?
When they're all that you want and it hurts so bad
Sleepless in London, woah
Sleepless in London Woah

Shereen:
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel the same way too
I gave my heart, gave it to you
But you won't give yours back to me

Jess with Shereen:
Staring at, at my phone, here in my bed
Wishing on all the words I never said
I keep on typing you these messages
Knowing that, that I won't ever hit send, I'm

All:
Sleepless in London, all I think about is you
My heart is breaking and I don't know what to do
Have you ever, ever felt like that?
When they're all that you want and it hurts so bad
Sleepless in London, woah
Sleepless in London Woah

Amira:
You're in love, just not with me
A secret crush, a sad movie
And I can feel me break
But if I hear you say my name
My heart that you can save

All:
Sleepless in London, all I think about is you
My heart is breaking and I don't know what to do
Have you ever, ever felt like that?
When they're all that you want and it hurts so bad
Sleepless in London, woah
Sleepless in London, woah

Jess:
I can't sleep unless you're here with me
I'm sleepless
