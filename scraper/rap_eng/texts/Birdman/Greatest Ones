Yeah, yeah

Got D-Roc on beats

[Chorus: King Issa]
Another one, we on another one (Another one)
I swear that my brother like my mother's son (My mother’s son)
Ashes to ashes, that's the dust, nigga (Dust)
At the end of the day, all we had was us, nigga (Us)
Right from Decatur, it's the greater one (Decatur)
Nazareth like the Creator’s son (Creator's son)
From the bottom, we done made it up (Amen)
Man, I swear I couldn't've made this up

[Verse 1: King Issa]
Got a lil' bitch that be dancin' (She dancin')
I done left her 'lone but she still harrassin’ (Harrassin’)
She know I'ma do her wrong, no romancing
And I only want the Benjamin Franklins, thank you
Walk up in the bank like, "Hey, it’s nice to meet you"
I don't tell her nothin' 'cause I’m what she wanna hear
You know I can bless ya, don't let 'em finesse ya
You ain't nothin' special, can't treat you like you special
I could teach you like professor, I could read you like a test
I could please you to your best, satisfaction, yes
I'm smokin', gettin' high like I got cataracts in my eye
3.14, all my niggas splittin' that pie, haha

[Chorus: King Issa]
Another one, we on another one (Another one)
I swear that my brother like my mother's son (My mother's son)
Ashes to ashes, that's the dust, nigga (That's the dust, nigga)
At the end of the day, all we had was us, nigga (It was us, nigga)
Right from Decatur, it's the greater one (Decatur)
Nazareth like the Creator's son (Amen)
From the bottom, we done made it up (Made it up)
Man, I swear I couldn't've made this up (I couldn't've made this up)

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Stunna, yeah
For real, let's get it D-Roc, out the pound
A hundred ones with a hundred drums (A hundred drums)
Supermodels with a hundred funds (A hundred funds)
Extra clips, we do it once (We do it once)
Super Bowl with the bass drum (Bass drum)
Simple money so they know we won (They know we won)
We mop the turf for the dead ones (For the dead ones)
We came through and we stuntin' for 'em (Stuntin' for 'em)
Alligator with a hundred bonds (A hundred bonds)
The woodgrain got the cherry fronts (Cherry fronts)
I been a stunner, bitch, I got the number (I got the number)
Pull up on you, bitch, another number (Another number)

[Chorus: King Issa]
Another one, we on another one (Another one)
I swear that my brother like my mother's son (My mother's son)
Ashes to ashes, that's the dust, nigga (That's the dust, nigga)
At the end of the day, all we had was us, nigga (It was us, nigga)
Right from Decatur, it's the greater one (Decatur)
Nazareth like the Creator's son (Amen)
From the bottom, we done made it up (Made it up)
Man, I swear I couldn't've made this up (I can't make this up)

[Verse 3: Jacquees]
Walkin' with a hundred thousand (Hundred thousand)
I buy anything I want, bitch, I ain't browsin' (Bitch, I ain't browsin')

Water fountain, jewelry wetter than a fountain (It's a fountain)
Mmh, this for them niggas that was doubtin' (That was doubtin')

Don't wanna play with my gang, we was down before fame

Don't fuck with me right now, I'm on chill mood (Chill mood)
Make a wrong move, they'll kill you (Flame, for real)

[Chorus: King Issa]
Another one, we on another one (Another one)
I swear that my brother like my mother's son (My mother's son)
Ashes to ashes, that's the dust, nigga (That's the dust, nigga)
At the end of the day, all we had was us, nigga (It was us, nigga)
Right from Decatur, it's the greater one (Decatur)
Nazareth like the Creator's son (Amen)
