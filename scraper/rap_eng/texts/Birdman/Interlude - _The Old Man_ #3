Brian I want to make sure you and your whole crew is doing the right thing for you
You got to remember...
One bad apple in the bunch is not a good thing
You got a bad apple get rid of it now
Cause all it's going to do is make rotten tomatoes and rotten apples out of the rest of the bunch
That's where you lose your respect from
You got to remember, the whole name of the game is being above board of everything else
No bullshit. There can't be no lieing no nothin
There's no going around you no guys going around you everything we do now is from the up and up
All your guys if anybody you got doubt in your mind that you can't trust them they got to go now
Because it's too late later
Later than they got to go just like you say in some of your records
"you take the nine out with the seven cent bullet", that's all that's got to be done
If there's any doubt in your mind now, anybody even if it's close to you, they got to go now
We don't need anybody bringin' any heat to us
We got enough heat lookin at us all over us as it it already
