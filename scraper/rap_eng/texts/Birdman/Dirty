Verse 1: TQ, (Baby)

Lately I been thinking about love doesnt offend happen to me (Fo sho playa)
The only thing I always think of stays inside of me
Go on we get out the kitchen because my bitch is cookin
Me and miss daisy kissin while ain't nobody lookin
Cook out at my uncles house whole neighborhood gonna be there
Its the fourth of july so you know its on at the pier
I love them country girls with them big 'ol butts
Can't get my hopes up cause she prolly my cousin
Some time when I get real homely and a nigga feel all alone
I put down my microphone time to go home

[Hook]

Dirty
Home thin cotton rows
And them gangstas role on white Volvo
With my grandpa cussin on this old dirt road
I clean up my stirty damn I wanna go home

Verse 2: TQ, (Baby)

I won't forget where I done came from (You better not boy) before I even knew
I was me
Saw all the flicks of me and my moms playin with the moths in the trees
And yes I do remember all them family reunions
Grandmama had 24 kids and thats the damn sure truth
Even when I moved to cali had to go back every summer
Grandaddy got so excited think santa clause was coming
Gettin down in the middle of the road Mini V a party tonight
Me and Pink drinken beer gettin high as a kite
Even when I got bigga
Westside for life nigga
Wherever I go I take the dirty south with me

[Hook x2]

TQ (Baby)

This one right here (What about it?)
Goes out to the dirty south
Where we all came from
Home of the struggle baby
(Come fuck wit me nigga we can roll through my project)
For my grandaddy
I love him
Rest in peace

Verse 3: TQ

Lately I been thinking about love doesnt offend happen to me
The only thing I always think of stays inside of me

Chorus x3

Baby:

Nigga I got dis bling bling for ya
And dis ching ching for ya
I got a brand new Bentley on dolo's for ya
And you come down here and make love with us mang
Ya Understand

[Hook to fade]
