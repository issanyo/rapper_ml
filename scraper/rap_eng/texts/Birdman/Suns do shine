[Hook]
I’m from where suns do shine
You know the guns do bust, we make the pussy nigga play
And yet we stay on the ground, nigga, we’re getting it up
Nigga, we’re getting it up
I’m from where suns do shine
You know the guns do bust, we make the pussy nigga play
And yet we stay on the ground, nigga, we’re getting it up
Nigga, we’re getting it up

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Nigga, money talk bulshit walk, we all know that
Choke a nigga, leave him and choke, we all do that
It’s headlights and big time, fucking with my shine, nigga
You gonna be headlights of headlines
Trying to get my money right
Niggers better get it right
Fucking with my liter, get some headlights
Rolling with this money and the power
Hustling for the liquor, hundred Gs for an hour
Posing on the block, nigga, trolling every dollar
Flussing on them hoes with this money and the power
Fuck what you ever heard, nigga, I’ve been moving birds
Grinding up to your home and saw it on every curve
Off to another bitch, know I’m on other shit
Represent mine born hood, bitch
Ride till I die in this hood, bitch
Get money and stay high till I die, bitch

[Hook]
I’m from where suns do shine
You know the guns do bust, we make the pussy nigga play
And yet we stay on the ground, nigga, we’re getting it up
Nigga, we’re getting it up
I’m from where suns do shine
You know the guns do bust, we make the pussy nigga play
And yet we stay on the ground, nigga, we’re getting it up
Nigga, we’re getting it up

[Verse 2: Ceto]
And the niggers know I got it from the three to the nine
And you can drop it in a pot and you won’t lose a dime
Hard hustling, I’m over it, I sit back and got some cold shots, nigga
I’m on some take over shit
And you can call it what you want, but when my niggers come home
I’m thorn apart like when Frank came home
Got a ticket to your twenty, you don’t fuck with this shit
They ride all day behind this click right chip
Fuck how you feel, I'mma get it regardless
Niggers never gave us nothing New Orleans
We had to get it how we live round here, nigga die down
You suck in line round here, weak
They gave us a vibe right here, now you’re wondering why we’re stressing
City’s in a state of depression
So don’t ask me no questions about me and none of mine
I got a question for you, dick suckers
Why you bitches ain’t billionaire?

[Outro: Birdman]
I’m from where suns do shine
You know the guns do bust, we make the pussy nigga play
And yet we stay on the ground, nigga, we’re getting it up
Nigga, we’re getting it up
