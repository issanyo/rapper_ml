[Chorus: Jacquees]
I got big money dreams (Big money dreams)
Bright lights, limousines (Bright lights, limousines)
You see me on your TV (See me on your TV)
You know this shit ain't come easy, no lie
But I make it look easy, make it look easy, make it look easy, yeah
But I make it look easy, make it look easy, make it look easy
She tryna tease me, said she don’t need me, but she ain't easy, yeah
I love my bitch, she get me so hard, she do it so easily

[Verse 1: King Issa]
She make it look easy, pretty please me, all on her knees and yeah
I tell her, "Thank you," after she bless me, just like I'm sneezin’, yeah
Head like a seizure, yeah
Remember forever, don't you get amnesia, yeah
I never need you, yeah
I'ma keep it a buck, I got shit on the line
Don't you be playin', girl, ain't wastin' my time
Fuck all that make-up, don't wear a disguise
Fuck all that shit, she don’t nickle and dime
Gave you my heart, got the heart of a lion
Came with that action, you know I’ma be fine
Right now I'm goin’ with the flow
They fucked up and gave me the flow
I got a lot on my mind, and right now you runnin' the show
Why is you runnin' to go?
I ain't gon’ beg you, I kept it too player
She ain't with the gang, she just wanna lay up
I move through the city, they thought I was the mayor
I handle my business, I could never fail
They say you a ho, I could never tell
She love me so good, she fuck me so well
I'm grindin' 'bout love, in these shinin' lights
We shinin' bright, yeah

[Chorus: Jacquees]
I got big money dreams (Big money dreams)
Bright lights, limousines (Bright lights, limousines)
You see me on your TV (See me on your TV)
You know this shit ain't come easy, no lie
But I make it look easy, make it look easy, make it look easy, yeah
But I make it look easy, make it look easy, make it look easy
She tryna tease me, said she don't need me, but she ain't easy, yeah
I love my bitch, she get me so hard, she do it so easily

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Might buy me a pound, smoke with my rounds, listen to Weezy, yeah
When I fly to your town, comin' around, you gotta come see me, yeah
Switch up my clothes, flip it to go, got a new season, yeah
And all of my bros, they know the code, we on that G shit, yeah
Birdman too fly for 'em
Stayed up, stay high for 'em
Drippin' off in that Tom Ford
Want a bag, come sign for it
It wasn't easy (Nah)
Run up, park, shoot, leave 'em (Leave 'em)
Shawty be leanin' (Leanin')
I don't move a muscle, I know she gon' feed me (Feed me)
You see how she treat me (Treat me)
But Stunna been boss, but Stunna been kingin' (Kingin')
We pull up, we squeezin' (Squeezin')
We got it from dirt and nothin' came easy (Nothin' came easy)
Yellin' RIP Lo (RIP Lo)
We miss him for sure
Rich Gang for life (Yeah)
But we livin' that life

[Chorus: Jacquees & Birdman]
I got big money dreams (Big money dreams)
Bright lights, limousines (Bright lights, limousines)
(Deep off in the middle on this world)
You see me on your TV (See me on your TV)
(Dry land, can't see)
You know this shit ain't come easy, no lie (Four hours walk)
But I make it look easy, make it look easy, make it look easy, yeah (I see you, shawty)
But I make it look easy, make it look easy, make it look easy (Pop one, real one)
She tryna tease me, said she don't need me, but she ain't easy, yeah (Callin', money on that chair wood, yeah yeah)
I love my bitch, she get me so hard, she do it so easily

[Outro: Birdman & Jacquees]
Lifestyle boy, lost at it
It's too deep to see land
Yeah
Pull them skis out
Sticks with a hundred
You believe that?
But I make it look easy, make it look easy, make it look easy, yeah
