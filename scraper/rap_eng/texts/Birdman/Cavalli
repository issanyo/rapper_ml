[Chorus]
Cavalli on me
Baby come and put your body on me
I know niggas that are plottin' on me
Money on my head they ain't collect
My mama mad cause she gave me credit
Circle homies gotta stay protected
Pussy nigga reachin' for my necklace
Niggas hatin' and this shit pathetic

Baby come put your body on me
Shifty niggas who be plottin on me
Face good the plug drop it on me
That sign with me got dimes with me
Got height with me got bags with me
I'ma shoot nigga you can't box with me

Moonwalkin' like I'm Michael Jackson

Catch a play you can volley on me

[Chorus]
Cavalli on me
Baby come and put your body on me
I know niggas that are plottin' on me
Money on my head they ain't collect
My mama mad cause she gave me credit
Circle homies gotta stay protected
Pussy nigga reachin' for my necklace
Niggas hatin' and this shit pathetic
Versace on me
Baby come put your body on me
Shifty niggas who be plottin on me
Face good the plug drop it on me
That sign with me got dimes with me
Got height with me got bags with me
I'ma shoot nigga you can't box with me
Plug talk [?]

Steph's on me I'm moon walking

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Keep them jewels on me

Can't lose on me
The blues on me
The shoe the clues nigga [?]
We talkin' we chalkin' nigga the news on it

The hills with clouds and the chanels with model figures
A purse bag strap and a loaded mag with hallows in it
