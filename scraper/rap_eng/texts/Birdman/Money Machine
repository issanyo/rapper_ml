[Lil Wayne - Chorus]
Bitch I’m paid, thats all i gotta say
Can’t see you lil niggas, the money in the way
Bitch I’m paid Bitch B-tcha I’m paid
Bitch I’m paid Bitch B-tcha I’m paid
Bitch I’m paid, thats all i gotta say
Bitch I’m paid, thats all i gotta say
Bitch I’m paid Bitch B-tcha I’m paid
Bitch I’m paid Bitch B-tcha I’m paid

[Birdman - Verse]
Hardbody cocaine flow dope game never wrote more cane
More to gain more money not a choke smoke.. cane
More money blood Mary Jane
Switchin ya lane doing thangs nigga making change
Fast like a hurry
More money that i ever seen bitch don’t you worry
That’s how we breaded uptown soldier
Never did 4 bitch known how i roll her
The Porsche came wit candy
The money on the line
Hundred g’s all the time
Nigga pitch the sunshine
4 dope Cartier old hoe still there
So i brought her to the mall
Bitch! shawty we don’t care
Ball til you fall, bitch she be shinin’ hard time
Bought my bitch a white mink and a matching benz 5
Priceless in the Lambo, Hustlin wit my ammo
Shinin’ like a diamond when i jump of out this Lambo

[Chorus]

[Birdman - Verse 2]
Jump through the lane, Nothing ever change
Got more money so shit still the same
More cane nigga so we never did change
Live through the cycle nigga struggle for the fame
Money came more so we hustle all the time
More that we get Nigga more that we fly
The sunshine came to the moon how we grind
Nigga money now still flippin’ all the time
The motor change niggas so the watch wit the meter
Cartier face every time that i see her
Chandelier lights to the prices of the dice
Roll a hundred g’s nigga fuck the same night
Poppin Don P Red champagne
Alize poppin more blowin air
Draggin’ that brown nigga holdin uptown puttin’ it down hold my crown got the game of the ground
That’s how we get it, more money on the island
More money by da hour, More muscle wit this power
Climbin more fences, Higher than a light
More money so bright, So we cash it that nite
Why another million, Still another ticket
Bought another lambo, bought another building
Flossin all the time, Porsche, Benz, truck, every time i pull up
Somethin new came up, Flossin with the ice
Nigga priceless wit the life, Give a fuck about the price
Do the same thing twice

[Chorus]
[End]
