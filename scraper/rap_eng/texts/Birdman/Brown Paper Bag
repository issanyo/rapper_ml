[Intro]
All brown paper bag (Uh-oh)
All brown paper bag (Uh-oh)
All brown, all brown
Fill it up with ones

[Chorus]
All brown paper bag, fill it up with ones
All brown paper bag, fill it up with ones
Fill it, fill it up with ones

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I got that paper bag full of paper
Bag full of kush
Big chopper, I can hit you from a hundred foots
What's happening Wardy?
How you on it buddy?
Them bitches checking for me
Tell them I'm with Swizz Swizzy
They call me Wizzy Fizzy
Holler back right now I'm busy
I am the president
You just play your position
And I hope that door don't hit you
Get up out of my office crawfish
Don't let them sharkies get you
This beat's a car collision
Check out my car collection
Yeah look at my rims hoe
Mercedes with them kidneys
Naw that's a Benzo
I don't pop them pills no
But I pop them rubber bands
Man I can get like fifty thousand in that brown bag

[Chorus] X3

[Verse 2 - Birdman]
Yeah, nigga
Cook a whole, make it out a whole and a half bitch
Shit, Birdman in a Benz with the duffle stuffed
Got a chopper with a drum and one iced up
Them people hot around my way but we don't give a fuck
We on the grind for the shine trying to come up

A black MAC, black six, and a black Hummer
Them thirteen hundreds, fourteen hundreds
We be getting money
Drop it off, get to work, nigga keep it running
Garbage bag full of cash, nigga keep it coming
In my hood red Phantom, nigga we be stunting
Got the block blocked off, nigga we be hustling
Brown duffle bag filled up with cash
Sixteen years old with a brand new Jag' bitch

[Chorus] X2

[Verse 3 - Swizz Beats]
Get it up
In the air
Get it up
In the air
N-N-N-Now money, cars, clothes, hoes
All a nigga know so
I'm from the ghetto so
Give me my pesos
All brown paper bag
I could fill it up with ones
Nigga fill it up with ones
Hey fill it up with ones
I bet that she's a stripper dancer, dancer, dancer
Hey, hey stuff it in the thing dog
Damn right, I be popping my collar
In a all black Impala
Making fiends want to holler
Got the suede on my headrest
Gold on my damn bracelet
Hey triple gold nigga
Sucker I ain't riding thin
You want me come and get me
I'm in 360 (Ferrari man)
Cash Money's with me

[Chorus] X3
Like father, like son (repeat to fade)
