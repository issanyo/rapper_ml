[Chorus: Money Man]
Designer everything know you can't style on me
My niggas wild homie
Just left the house but I forgot I had a bag of gas on me
And a large amount of cash on me
When I turn it at the house she gonna feel some type of weird bout it
(uh-huh uh-huh)
She tryin' her best to hide it
That nigga fake, he tryin' his best to hide it, but I see right inside it
(uh-huh uh-huh)
I see her choosiness written all over herself
(uh-huh uh-huh)
Pc's on my  Rav4
Fuck it nigga gotta lie for it
She keep it real with me
(uh-huh uh-huh)

[Verse 1: Money Man]
Jumped in the water, had to learn to swim with the shark
Pussy nigga probably never left his front yard
Now he hard
These niggas kill me these days
With all their feminine ways
I know what they did yea I smell the pussy on you
These niggas never learn until educate em with a stick in they face
Then they jump right back in their place
They try their hardest to stay safe
He think I'm dumb like I ain't never seen a nigga lurk before
I'm just gonna dump this shit and let it go
She tryin' her hardest not to catch feelings cause she done been hurt before
Scared nigga acted like you've never seen work before
I still remember the  other day when i ain't have a dime
Then I forgot about it
Had some problems  with a couple niggas in the streets and they forgot about it
They'll probably get shout about it
Lil nigga you not about it (Uh-huh Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Money Man]
Designer everything know you can't style on me
My niggas wild homie
Just left the house but I forgot I had a bag of gas on me
And a large amount of cash on me
When I turn it at the house she gonna feel some type of weird bout it
(uh-huh uh-huh)
She tryin' her best to hide it
That nigga fake, he tryin' his best to hide it, but I see right inside it
(uh-huh uh-huh)
I see her choosiness written all over her face
(uh-huh uh-huh)
Pc's on my Rav4
Fuck it nigga gotta lie for it
She keep it real with me
(uh-huh uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Birdman]
80 days 50 whips
80 days 50 chips
Eight figures on the B side we suicide for them chips
Same ways on the east side I'm on the sea side, move chips
The same ways on the south side and the west side and we dip
Big fish with the big waves helicopter them fast days
Six keys with no side way
Stay high , bitch gettin paid
84 i got my first brick
94 i got a 100 whips
Stayin extra with the choppa
Pussy nigga I poppin'
Duck tapes with them clips
Serve a nigga done been
Pussy nigga can't win
Pussy nigga been tense
Niggas know how we do it
Iced up and we fluid
Stay fly nigga , rich nigga
No love lost fore they blew it
Pussy
