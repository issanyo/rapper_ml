(Verse 1 - Lil Wayne)
Young desperado straight out the grotto
I'm so bad my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga but see me as a fuckin' rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought ain't it? How the fuck would I know?
Nigga I been gettin' my Cher in (share in) like Sonny Bono
I ran the streets... check my bio
I started high wit' two O's just like Ohio
I'm fuckin' nuts... cashews
But I'm so DC like fat shoes
I skate away... like later dudes!
Never get caught baby I'm mashed potato smooth
And just when it stopped... I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog... no Asian food
I wet up the party so have a bathin' suit
And daisy dukes you bitch ass nigga

(Chorus - Lil Wayne)
Keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... keep talkin' that shit that you talkin'
And we gon' have to get into some gangsta shit
My nigga... 'Cause you ain't really even 'bout all that
You ain't really even 'bout all that
And don't'cha forget.. I know ya you ain't 'bout all that
You ain't never been about all that... fall back

(Verse 2 - Fat Joe)
Niggas must want Joey to lean on 'em
Flash the binky splash his dreams on 'em
Let 'em sleep on it it's nothin' to Crack
Lay the murder game down back to hustlin' packs
Yeah Weezy homie's got yo' back whether raps or macks
Either way they both spit like BRRRRAT!
Nigga... them muhfuckas is broke like them levies
And we done sold so much dope ain't shit you tell me
Nigga... how you want it ?? coke or dog food?
My shit'll have you runnin' naked like an old school
And yeah we 'bout it 'bout it and you ain't ridin' on me
Unless ya got a whole fuckin' suicidal warmin'
And I'm a rider homie and you can find it on me
That 40 cal'll get you ??
This shit is funny to me
All these niggas frontin' war but they runnin' from me... Crack!

(Chorus - Lil Wayne)

(Verse 3 - Birdman)
I had 'em as lil' niggas raised 'em 'round real niggas
Poppin' bottles fuckin' wit' them bitches nigga
Made money to the ceilin' me and my young nigga
Chillin' I'm in the streets hustlin' gettin' money nigga
Changed all my new shoes nigga got some new tools
Nigga got some mo' jewels we was gettin' money
And ain't nothin' ever changed still doin' the thang
Still gettin' money still spendin' change
We hustlin' from Sunday to Sunday
And we grindin' everyday like the money ain't comin'
Nigga... yeah we ridin' woodgrains and minks
Got the dope in the Hummer cold case for that thang
I hate the law for what they done did they broke in niggas cribs
Wish I woulda caught 'em I'dda split they fuckin' wig
3rd Ward let me claim my fame
I put it down Uptown I'ma do my thang believe dat

(Chorus - Lil Wayne)
