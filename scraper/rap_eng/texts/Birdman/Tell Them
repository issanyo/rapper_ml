[Verse 1: Ralo]
Came in this bitch like LeBron
Tell them I already won
Shoot the bitch up for fun
They gave the wrong one the gun
Tell them I'm one of the dons
I don't take shit from no one
Trap out the house 'til them folks come
When they ask me some' I go dumb
I just bought my bitch an education
I hope that she get to her destination
I wanna see her lil family make it
Just 'cause these niggas be hella hating
Remember mama cried about the rent
I bought some dope, I was tired of it
You should've seen my environment
None of these niggas didn't buy me shit
I got them bands on me now, they can't abandon me now
They the ones handing 'em out, your bitch a fan of me now
My lil nigga said he quit school, he told me that like that shit cool
He just want to be a big dude, he gon' get ate like a six two

[Chorus: Ralo]
Tell them I'm never gon' hide
Tell them I'm never gon' die, I'm still alive
Tell them I'm never gon' cry
I got that falcon that pie, I work it out
I looked that judge in the eye, told them that I would get out
Now look at what I done got, Houston done let me get out

[Verse 2: Dae Dae]
Look what I came from
Look at them diamonds, they shinin' on me
Look at them shine, it's time for it
Ain't it 'bout time he grind for it?
On eighty-five, just me and my ho
I keep that glizzy, who want smoke?
They think they know me, I'm John Doe
These are old hundreds, I'm selling dope
I keep gunners with me every day
I'm with my partners nigga, every day
Long as my kids and my baby mama straight
Long as my dad got a house and a lake
Long as my mama here with me
Long as my brother here with me
Long as I got Ralo here with me
You know them opps in the building
Know Love Life don't got no feelings
We just pull up, shoot and hit, ayy
Diamonds on shake, I know they hate
Look at they face, Dae Dae got cake
This is straight A shit, I want that Wraith
Spend me a check and go buy it today
We got our blessings off scribe and faith
I had to hustle and find me a way
But you can tell 'em

[Chorus: Ralo]
Tell them I'm never gon' hide
Tell them I'm never gon' die, I'm still alive
Tell them I'm never gon' cry
I got that falcon that pie, I work it out
I looked that judge in the eye, told them that I would get out
Now look at what I done got, Houston done let me get out

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Sideways on the other side, we was pullin' up just to get paid
Lace it up and we came up and we chop it down up in different ways
Big money, we flip money, and we out of bounds but they got sprayed
Pepped it up so we step it up and we stuntin' huntin' in that Bentley brazy
Poppin' that shit like, like
A nigga want spray me, crazy lazy
Poppin' that shit like, like
A nigga won't pull up sprayin' crazy
Back in them eighties, four-four baby
Platinum baby, platinum navy, platinum crazy
Platinum crazy, got these niggas crazy
Plaques on the wall nigga, got these niggas crazy
Numbers don't faze me, big stunt don't faze me
Big money we make it, big money it takes it

[Chorus: Ralo]
Tell them I'm never gon' hide
Tell them I'm never gon' die, I'm still alive
Tell them I'm never gon' cry
I got that falcon that pie, I work it out
I looked that judge in the eye, told them that I would get out
Now look at what I done got, Houston done let me get out

[Outro: Ralo & Dae Dae]
Tell them I'm never gon' hide
Tell them I'm never gon' die
Tell them I'm never gon' cry
Tell them I'm never gon' hide
Tell them I'm never gon' die
I'm still alive
Ralo
