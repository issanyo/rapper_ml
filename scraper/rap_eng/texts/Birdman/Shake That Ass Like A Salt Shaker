Shake that ass like a salt shaker
And don't let a dog stank ho break ya
These bitches in the world tryin' to shake me
But I'm Lil Slim, bitch -- you can't break me
So let me wax that ass and let me tax that ass

Let me hit them from the back cause I ain't eating no cat
If a bitch pussy sweat, I'll let my dick flex, bitch

And don't let a dog stank ho break ya
