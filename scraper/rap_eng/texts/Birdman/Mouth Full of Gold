[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Please pardon me but I'm passin gas
To my entourage, no gas masks
I'm in my old school, with the Georgia tag
With my Georgia ass and my red flag
I'm g'd up from the feet up
In my black van wit my feet up
And the blinds down and the beat up
Short bad bitch with the seat up
You know me, from the old me
On Jump street with the straight D
I was low key, at HB
Now I'm 3d, come face me
I went toe to toe with the best of 'em
I bust shots at the rest of 'em
Don't test me, no tester
I rape you, like Chester
I'm a rich ass nigga you bitch ass nigga
You a club pop off ol' snitch ass nigga
Went up to the game Felt symptom of fame
Run up on me put you in a ditch quick nigga
I'm a tell you twice, cause it's Gucci two times
Fuck your clique and fuck your wife
If you got drama nigga, you can meet me outside
Get your head bust wide for your old man's pride

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Platinum in my mouth bitch
Shoot you in your face, shit

All this money ain't shit, livin' how we live it bitch
Redid my grill nigga, Platinum to that gold shit
High price, high life, Do this shit every night

Blood rich gang nigga, we got them rangs nigga
Flippin' them things nigga, ready to bang nigga

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I put red shoes on my black car
I'm talkin' slick like a rap star
I'm walkin' slick like a trap star
Rich young G with gold teeth
A triple black cat just crossed my path
But it's a four door Jaguar
They put me in this game I put you lames back at the snack bar
I'm black as hell but I'm rich as well
Got 3 dime pieces at the hotel
I'm goin' hard, they blowin' hard
Im strapped up, no body guards
I pull your card, told you disregard
I'm goin' dumb but I'm thinking smart
But if you try my squad I’ll hide yo body parts
That’s a single shout out to Boulevard
That’s single shout out to bank head
Gotta give ya something Lou Cammelton
Cause I pull up in that yella thang
Fat pockets like I just been gamblin'
I put 100 K on my grill shawty
That’s the way I feel shawty
Ice cream on my face and Chain
Cause' that’s the life I live shawty GUCCI!!!!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
Rich ass nigga with a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
With a mouth full of gold
