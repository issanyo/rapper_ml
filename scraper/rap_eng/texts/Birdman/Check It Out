Yeah (3x)
You know that, yeah
The fire rising, yeah burning say you stuck with a loss
Game ain't based off [?], so ain't no loving involved
Riddled yo whip, them people gon think that the Russians involved
As I grew in, as I learned I got accustomed to God

Made it hot around my way a couple of time, still ride 'round with that 9
That's some, that's all the time
Lawd, can not get caught slipping even when it get slippery
Life a unknown mystery, lost all my discipline, that's ignorant

I told myself that it's time to stop all that playing and make a few millions
Got one two many problems, nigga my set on straight killing
Wild magnolia I can't listen, this lifestyle bring a lotta women
Free coach, it's a freak show
Should've fucked around and used a condom with ha

Straight freak, let my potnas hit ha
10 deep, that's a lotta niggas
Laid back in the maybach, with the Birdman with a choppa pistol
Ion think they gon stop a nigga
Ian never share a dolla with'em
We ain't never go head up, or played pitch or tackle
Ain't sharin' nun

Besides the losses that I took, yeah life great (life great)
I got the clout, she gon do what I say
Do whatever I want, I don't know how much she could take
Every nigga in this world want be the boss but don't got what it takes (real life hate)

Guilty conscious talking to me, ima let that sit on my mind
Ignore them voices that I heard, can't let that play with my mind
Since 12 been playing with them minds, can't let a bitch play with my mind
My Top Young Shooters tryna spin, they hate sitting inside
I feel my alter ego tripping, its just sitting inside me
I just alter my new glock, and put a dick in the 9
Don't need no beam when I start popping
I'm gon shoot 'till it lock
A ghetto child from off the block, I was born in the 90s
