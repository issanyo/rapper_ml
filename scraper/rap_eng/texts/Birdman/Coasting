[Intro]
1995 and I'm high
Buddha run this bitch
Buddha run this bitch
1995 and I'm high
Floating on a cloud
Floating in the sky

[Verse One]
It's just another day, in my hood the C-U-T for the giggity-gangsta love to the capital letter G
And I'm stepping outside, just to see where my love at
Find out where the bud at, and see how many fools want the crooked-crack
But when I think, I don't even get into it
Instead I devote my time to chilling, you know how we flowin'
So I can set the street and hit the front-store
Got some mixed gin and juice and bailed out the door
Had, to get into something, cause its my day, a Friday
And I'll make sure, that everything on my way
Coasting down the highway, feelin' the breeze, it's 80 degrees, and I gots my Glock right between my knees
Cause even though I might be having fun (That's right)
I never leave the pad without packing a gun
So then I holla'd at my partner, Big L
To see what was up with the plant that had the funky smell, when inhaled
Bought the zip then I split the [?]
To roll in these spliffs, thinking about how it was gonna be when I arrive on Mars
Cause I'm 'bout ready to get my blast on
Get with the *inhale* once or twice fool, then you know I'm gone
Off into the cannabis sativa
Just crumblin' up the herb bout to spark another reefer, with my niggas
But some of y'all just don't know the deal
Fool I'm on the real, cause that's just how we chill in the....

[Hook]
Coasting down the highway
Feeling the breeze, its 80 degrees and I gots my Glock right between my knees
Coasting down the highway, see I'm from down South and I gots to keep that blunt in my mouth
Coasting down the highway
Feeling the breeze, its 80 degrees and I gots my Glock right between my knees
Coasting down the highway
Fool I'm from down South and we gots to keep them blunts in our mouths

[Verse Two]
Now I done got two blows down, but it ain't over yet
Don't want to go to business so its time I hit another set
Bail out the cut, heading to the East-side
Cause I got love on that side from C.M.R. (Right)
Made it to Canal and hit 596, on the payphone, so Baby know its on
[?], holla at me
Hit me on my 546 so I can tell you where to meet me
Got in contact with the O.G.s
Instead of that nigga B my homie Sugar Slim paged me
Cause Cash Money pays me, and I be down with the local 580
But anyway, I'm just too toned down to call them back
So I jumped in my ride and headed where the happenings at
Rolex, where the niggas and hoes flex
It's going on with the two dogs until dawn
But a nigga like me just be too high for that shit (What)
And fresh was bumpin' Do or Die in that bitch (What)
But fuck that, I kept my mouth on that ganja with 5 on the mutha-fuckin [?]
Somebody say
Lets stow it, we can blow it, now y'all know it ain't no thang to me
Cause on the real, this is how we chill

[Hook]
Coasting down the highway
Feeling the breeze, its 80 degrees and I gots my Glock right between my knees
Coasting down the highway, see I'm from down South and I gots to keep that blunt in my mouth
Coasting down the highway
Feeling the breeze, its 80 degrees and I gots that Glock right between my knees
Coasting down the highway
Fool I'm from down South and I gots to keep that blunt in my mouth

[Verse Three]
Man nowadays I stay lit to escape the pressures and the problems and the fools on this dirty world that my momma put me in
I wanna hate her but i can't G
'Cause she was in love with my pops and that ain't had nothing to do with me
I was just a figment of imagination before I was prestidigitated and brought into creation
A god, an heir to the throne, a son now a man striving to be number one
So don't make me have to pull out my poppa
Respond to the demons in my head then I drop her
You know it don't stoppa when I blocka blocka blocka
90 dead, bloody red, bloody red, nigga (Bloody red)
That's just how it is in the bloody city
Brothers will split your wig in the bloody city, so I keep that in mind when I step puffin' blunts on the streets getting high as I step
I gives a fuck about them people, see I pays when they step
Cause them hoes be about breaking niggas down to catch a wreck, but fuck that
And through it all I will survive
So I hope they recognize when i shine in the '95
And break me off mad fuckin' respect cause if not you've got to face death, and its like that

[Hook]
Coasting down the highway
Feeling the breeze, its 80 degrees and I gots my Glock right between my knees
Coasting down the highway, see I'm from down South and I gots to keep that blunt in my mouth
Coasting down the highway
Feeling the breeze, its 80 degrees and I gots that Glock right between my knees
Coasting down the highway
Fool I'm from down South and I gots to keep that blunt in my mouth

[Outro]
Nineteen-ninety-nigga we up in this bitch, we see that mar hoe
Shouts out to that nigga Tre Deuce
My nigga Suga Slim, Mannie Fresh, Bun B from Texas
My nigga Troy
All them mutha-fuckin' weed smokin'...
