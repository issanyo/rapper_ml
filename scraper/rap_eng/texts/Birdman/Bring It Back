Yea, Burrrrr, Burrr
CMB always

[Lil Wayne - Hook]
How come gettin money never gets boring
How come gettin money never gets boring
Baby I gotta stack, what you gonna do for it
Then you bring it back like the Mothaf-ckin chorus
And you bring it back back back back back back back
And you bring it back back back back back like a motherf-ckin chorus

[Birdman - Verse]
Back on my set
Tool in my hand
Big money was the plan
So i’m back where I started
Back where it come from
Back where we went wit it
Third ward soldier out the Phantom doing big business
Situations thick you got the homie toting two two’s
Comin back old skool
Did it like he want to
Headed to the pen now he back up on the slab
Big money of the ab
Hundred g’s in cash
Brand new whip, old skool Caddy
The dump truck
A stash spot
Then came up
Its more 1′s Nigga
Versace sheets
Serve is more money in the new fleet

[Hook]

[Birdman - Verse 2]
Bought a new Phantom
Suede with the gators
Brand new Louis always ready to spray it
Like father like son
Money is a must
These hoe’s we don’t trust
Brand new trucks
Shined every summer
Ran wit the numbers
Stash spot cool got a 50 piece humming
Back up on my saddle nigga hustle for my shine
Just an ordinary nigga on a million dollar grind
Big timer old skool, new skool nigga
Is more money homie
More money more money more money homie
My b-tchs paid Cavalli Shades
Blowin haze, Everyday

[Hook]

[Birdman - Verse 3]
Flip another hundred
Get another Hundred
Spend another Hundred
Burn another Hundred
Blow another Hundred
Fuck another Hundred
Get big money nigga, Stuntin on a hundred
50 Whips extra clips did it for the sunshine
Garbage bag full hard body wit a fireline
Flip another brick, Drink a little dip
Stunna Island nigga shinin’ wit a bad bitch
AR Nigga, riding skinny tires
Fully loaded high when you floatin’ in the sky
Rockin’ Gucci blades, ridin triple blades
Tats on the face, A Nigga’s been paid

[Hook]
