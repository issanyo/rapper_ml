[Hook: Hurricane Chris]
I'm in the club hollering
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay

[Verse: Birdman]
Say that red hat them red B's wife B's
23's out the Bentley and we stay fly
Hundred G's P-R-P's hum V's
We D-boys getting money on them 25's
5 star and that's me, a O.G
I'm from the three the thirteenth off the wild side
My young G and he a beast Tha Carter 3
That's more stuntin' but we hustlin' like it's do or die
We poppin' bottles with these championship rings
Models and thangs, [?]
We bring a few to the east and west wing
Show 'em how I'm livin' then I watch 'em all faint
Yeah

[Hook: Hurricane Chris]
I'm in the club hollering
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay
