[Verse 1]
Ay, ay, ay

Birdman daddy, no divin for fishes
Until you ducks, I'm stackin my riches
Brought mami to the mall and she ball wit a genius

Stilletto boot, wife beater and I minked her
Spend like crazy, if the broad freak me

Baby, in a coupe spin bout eighty
Bird island, know that I'm smilin
Broads on my yaught, wit they gucci and proper

Boss pimpin got sick off of power
Get it how you live, I'm a known survivor

[Hook - Toni Braxton]

[Verse 2]
Well it's the birdman daddy, I'll fly in any weather
I keep the birdlady with the feather in the pezzle
Always on the rock with the full length leather
I'm in the Benz, she in a new Lexus
22's cause we bird infested
Ruby red with the platinum necklace
She in the Escalade, so wild stretchin
I'm so so fly, the man done blessed me
Mami in the village so while dressed em
Mink on the boots wit the minked out sweater
Mink on the floor, with the mink chinchetta
Mink on the Gucci, with the mink on the leather
See I'm fly on these , mami ride on voles
Stop and go's on that new Range Rover
Time to go home, cause I gots to go because
(Mami is in the bed with the breakfast on the stove)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey pimp, it's the rich and famous
You drivin wreckless, you drivin dangerous
Twenty inches on the caddy, don't blame me
Slab on the floor, but it's my turn baby
Money ain't natin to me
See that birdman Jr., that somethin to me
What you know about runnin these streets
Get it how you live, and get it how ya be
Get it how ya hustle, and get it how ya see
Off parole so I'm puffin these trees
I'm so so high, I'm a world wide G
Connected to these streets, playa this cash money

[Hook]

[Baby in the backround]
Oh yeah, Stunner and TB man
Yo turn baby, got your mink on
Your gucci on, your prala on

Birdman daddy, I'm fly in any weather
