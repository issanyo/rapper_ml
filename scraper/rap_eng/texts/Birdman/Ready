[Intro: Birdman]
Sunday mornin', bright lights
Lookin' off the top of the yacht, lost at sea just a lifestyle

[Hook: Jacquees + Birdman]
I'ma hit her with my chains on
Money dancin', you'll get rained on
This a Maybach not a Range Rover
And you niggas see it ain't though
I'm with all my people
I brought all my people
Niggas ain't seein' me, niggas ain't seein' Que
When you in first place
Make the niggas wanna hate you
Tell all them niggas we ready
Did you not know we're ready?
I got money in the bank
She fuckin' with me cause I'm rank
And we gon' throw it in your face
Too much money in your face

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
I think that I won the race
I think all these niggas hate
If I want it then I got it
I ain't never had to wait
It's some killers right beside you
Fuckboys we despise you
We ain't even finna fight you
They gon' do they best to find you
Fuck your bitch all day
Send her back your way
Young Cash Money nigga, never fade away
I be on the rise, be in different states
Fuck these niggas I'm rollin', havin' shit my way

[Bridge: Jacquees]
Shoot the gun, boom-boom
Yeah, my niggas shoot the gun, boom-boom
I don't really know you, swear to God I don't really know you

[Hook: Jacquees]
I'ma hit her with my chains on
Money dancin', you'll get rained on
This a Maybach not a Range Rover
And you niggas see it ain't though
I'm with all my people
I brought all my people
Niggas ain't seein' me, niggas ain't seein' Que
When you in first place
Make the niggas wanna hate you
Tell all them niggas we ready
Did you not know we're ready?
I got money in the bank
She fuckin' with me cause I'm rank
And we gon' throw it in your face
Too much money in your face

[Verse 2: Birdman]
New whip, paper plates
Money make a nigga hate
Niggas knowin' that we straight
Chop him dead in his face
Glass plate, new place
100 bricks, big face
A rich nigga on the water
Versace jacket for my daughter
Big B, red boss
Stunna man floss cars
If you ain't made Forbes nigga
What the fuck is you talkin'?
I don't need no introduction than this
It's Stunna man, young and we gon' bang on a bitch

[Bridge: Jacquees]
Shoot the gun, boom-boom
Yeah, my niggas shoot the gun, boom-boom
I don't really know you, swear to God I don't really know you

[Hook: Jacquees]
I'ma hit her with my chains on
Money dancin', you'll get rained on
This a Maybach not a Range Rover
And you niggas see it ain't though
I'm with all my people
I brought all my people
Niggas ain't seein' me, niggas ain't seein' Que
When you in first place
Make the niggas wanna hate you
Tell all them niggas we ready
Did you not know we're ready?
I got money in the bank
She fuckin' with me cause I'm rank
And we gon' throw it in your face
Too much money in your face

[Outro: Birdman]
105 on a yacht, you understand me? Jacuzzi on some Scarface shit. Just a normal lifestyle, palm beaches and bitches and bottles and models, nigga. They love a nigga with money and power, nigga dead
