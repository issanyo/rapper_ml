Never wanna see backwards, all I ever did wanna just see baggage
Never wanna ever be "daddy"
Never ever wanna be my daddy

And all I ever wanna be was him (and what)
See I played in this game, and I laid in this game, all I ever wanna see was gems

Big money nigga 100 stacks (big racks)
Bad bitches in them new backs (big whoa)
