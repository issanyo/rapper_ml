[Intro: Jacquees]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Somethin like, somethin' like (Rich Gang)
Feelin' like, Feelin' like we made it
Supa Iz, DRoc-DRoc-DRoc

[Chorus: Jacquees]
You can get it, I feel it (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Stack that money up to the ceiling, yeah (Ceiling, ceiling)
You got niggas all in your business, yeah, yeah (Your business)
Why they worried 'bout what you gettin'? Yeah (Gettin', yeah yeah)
Summer's mine, winter time (Winter time)
I done put in overtime (Overtime)
I been hustlin' like this since back in the day
And it all paid off, what can I say? (Can I say?)

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
You heard the hype, you caught a one way to Miami (Miami)
Ayy, that's a bet, I'm on a round trip through your panties
We at the BET Awards, dressed like the Grammys
Pray to the Lord even though we sinnin' daily (Yeah)
Ayy, I've been tryna strap 'em down, don't want no baby (Don't want no baby)
Ayy, I've been tryna keep her 'round, lil' shawty dangerous (Lil' shawty dangerous)
And we've been runnin' through the town feelin' major, ayy (Feelin' major)
We take they cell phones now, bitch we invasive (We invasive)
I got a big house now with no neighbors (With no neighbors)
I make her jump up and down when she naked
Success feel better when you came from the basement
And I held everyone when they said I wouldn't make it (Yeah)

[Chorus: Jacquees]
You can get it, I feel it (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Stack that money up to the ceiling, yeah (Ceiling, ceiling)
You got niggas all in your business, yeah, yeah (Your business)
Why they worried 'bout what you gettin'? Yeah (Gettin', yeah yeah)
Summer's mine, winter time (Winter time)
I done put in overtime (Overtime)
I been hustlin' like this since back in the day
And it all paid off, what can I say? (Can I say?)

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah, millions stashed in my house
Got a brick stashed in my safe
Got a million stashed in that ceiling
Keep a paper, them plates
Suicide with that chopper
Did this shit my way
Jumped off in that lane
Put a hundred mil' on my plate (Stunna, music)
Above the ceiling
And we illin' 'bout this money, 'bout this billin'
And we did it 'til we killed it so they know just how we livin'
Big paper don't come
Love a nigga with the money
Got the whip game and gon' stunt (High life, mmh)
I showed her love, she rose me
I showed her baby, can't fold me (Money, money)
High rollers so you know the fee
Get the money, control the beast
Live the life, get the big feast

[Chorus: Jacquees]
You can get it, I feel it (Oh yeah, yeah)
Stack that money up to the ceiling, yeah (Ceiling, yeah)
You got niggas all in your business, yeah, yeah (Your business)
Why they worried 'bout what you gettin'? Yeah (Gettin', yeah yeah)
Summer's mine, winter time (Winter time)
I done put in overtime (Overtime)
I been hustlin' like this since back in the day
And it all paid off, what can I say? (Can I say?)
