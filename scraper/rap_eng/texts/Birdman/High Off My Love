[Verse 1: Paris Hilton]
So you think I'm bad, babe
And you keep acting like you want me
I don't need a little boy
You better turn it up just a little more

[Pre-Hook: Paris Hilton]
Keep my attention, I'm ready to go
My only intention's to give you a show
Light it up
I know you want it
Take a puff
Let's get high off our love
High off our love

[Hook: Paris Hilton]
Do you wanna get high off my love?
High off my love, high off my love
Do you wanna get high off my love?
High off my love, high off my love

[Bridge: Paris Hilton]
I'm an alien
I'm on a Venus trip
You're from Mars, baby
Let's kill this bitch

[Verse 2: Paris Hilton]
The night is young, it's time to kill it
Let's turn it up, I know you really want it
I wanna see you (oooh) go hard as you can
And let it show you're making demands

[Pre-Hook: Paris Hilton]
Keep my attention, I'm ready to go
My only intention's to give you a show
Light it up
I know you want it
Take a puff
Let's get high off our love
High off our love

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Rich Gang, so we taking off
Standing halo at the Birdman, I'm known to ball
Red Bugatti, it's time the man and the money talk
Old money with new money, we fill our Hummer
Stretch the numbers, we do the numbers, we get the money
Every summer 'cause we the ones to blow them hunnids
PH! Breh!

[Hook: Paris Hilton]
Do you wanna get high off my love?
High off my love, high off my love
Do you wanna get high off my love?
High off my love, high off my love
