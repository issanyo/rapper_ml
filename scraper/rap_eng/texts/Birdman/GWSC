[Intro: Jacquees & Neno Calvin]
Look, yeah (Yeah yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Calvin)

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees & Neno Calvin]
Girl you're fine, take your mind off of time
Each mind, girl you're mine (Bitch you mine)
Are you down, really down? Lay your body on the ground
Are you down (Is you down? Is you down?)

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Good weed, sex, and conversation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and elevation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and elevation (What?)

Good weed, sex, and elevation

[Verse 1: Neno Calvin]
Baby, kick your feet up, everything free
Drinks on me, weed on me (Weed on me)
M3RG (Know that), hah (Rich Gang)
Roll up some weed for the meantime
Hope you prepared 'cause I need mine
Few days with me and she feel fine
Fuckin' with you but she still mine
Feelings got her losing focus (Focus)
Pills got her pussy open (Open)
She just tryna get noticed (Noticed)
Give it to her slow motion (Motion)
I came up thuggin'
Right in my section, yeah murder mean nothin'
I murdered, they hate me
Drew in my face I cannot go a day, not got a day
Fuckin' on her for an hour
Smoke it off and take a shower
Shawty got me like, "Wowzers"
It ain't yours, bitch it's ours

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Good weed, sex, and conversation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (Yeah)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (Poppin' off, my partner)
Good weed, sex, and elevation (Few bad bitches)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (You understand me)
Good weed, sex, and elevation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and elevation (It's simple)
Good weed, sex, and elevation

[Verse 2: Birdman]
White Hennessy, Stunna blunts (Stunna blunts)
Cherry wood with the gold fronts (The gold fronts)
Get money or get dumped (Get dumped)
Don't play, nigga, don't front (Don't front)
Been a hustle, nigga, one of one (One of one)
Got a hundred with an extra drum (Extra drum)
Stunna Island with the whips and numbers (Whips and numbers)
Make the work flip, dip, and tumble (Rich Gang, tumble)
Palm trees with the big paper (Right)
Italian floors with the platinum gates (What?)
Big mansion up in LA (What?)
Fifty whips, nigga can't fade (Right)
Every day we the same (Right)
We put the block in the bank (What?)
We put the fire in the flame (Right)
We kept it G, never changed (What?)

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Good weed, sex, and conversation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and elevation (What?)
Good weed, sex, and conversation (Right)
Good weed, sex, and elevation (What?)

[Outro: Birdman & Jacquees]
Palm trees with the big paper (Palm trees with the big paper)
Italian floors with the platinum gates (Italian floors with the platinum gates)
Big mansion up in LA (Big mansion up in LA)
Fifty whips, nigga can't fade (Fifty whips, nigga can't fade)
Every day we the same
We put the block in the bank
We put the fire in the flame
We kept it G, never changed (We kept it G, never changed)
Good weed, sex, and conversation
Good weed, sex, and conversation
Good weed, sex, and conversation
Good weed, sex, and elevation
