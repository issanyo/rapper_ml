[Chorus: Jacquees]
Up one now, my niggas, they tryna get it (Yeah)
Up one now, but you wouldn't even pay attention (Alright)
Up one now, know I'm out here on a mission (Uh-huh)
Up one now, yeah you need to pay attention (Yeah)
Up one now, I'm on top for all the dishes now
Up one now, I'm turnin' all the bad bitches down
Up one now, no way I could turn the city down
Up one now, them niggas hate when I'm comin' 'round

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
I just flew in all the bitches, snowin', I'm touchin' down (Yeah)
I gotta win, so it ain't nothin' that I complain about (Nah)
I'm on the Henn', probably don't know what you be talkin' 'bout (What?)
Money my friend, bitch I got M's in my bank account (In my bank account)
Fuck makin' friends, niggas ain't real anyway, hey (Yeah)
Fuck how you feel, I spend your deal every day, hey (Yeah)
Red Bathing Ape, ayy, with the red Gucci snake, hey (What?)
Free my dawg that's down the road fightin' his case, hey (Free Gotti)
Pray to God every day (Every day)
Thank God for the day (For the day)
My jewelry shinin' from a distance
I told you I would get it, you ain't wanna listen (What? What? Yeah)

[Chorus: Jacquees & Birdman]
Up one now, my niggas, they tryna get it (Yeah)
Up one now, but you wouldn't even pay attention (Alright)
Up one now, know I'm out here on a mission (Uh-huh)
Up one now, yeah you need to pay attention (Yeah)
Up one now, I'm on top for all the dishes now (Yeah yeah)
Up one now, I'm turnin' all the bad bitches down
Up one now, no way I could turn the city down (Bri, dim them lights for me)
Up one now, them niggas hate when I'm comin' 'round (Give him space)

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Up one now, this fortune came with haters (With haters)
Can't save 'em 'cause we can deal with hatin' niggas (With hatin' niggas)
Gang bright, them rainy nights, can't save 'em nigga (Save 'em nigga)
They fell down in one round, couldn't weigh a nigga (Couldn't weigh a nigga)
One down, but they came in short
So we put two down the same way we show 'em to (We show 'em)
We eliminate the mediation and keep the paper
The situation, the situation, we can't erase it (Can't erase it)
Down, down, slide with my round (My round)
Wear that crown, will lay him down (Lay him down)
Bigger bags, we run the town (Run the town)
Loyal nigga, we out the pound

[Chorus: Jacquees & Birdman]
Yeah, up one now, my niggas, they tryna get it (Yeah)
Up one now, but you wouldn't even pay attention (Alright)
Up one now, know I'm out here on a mission (Uh-huh)
Up one now, yeah you need to pay attention (Yeah)
Up one now, I'm on top for all the dishes now (Yeah yeah)
Up one now, I'm turnin' all the bad bitches down
Up one now, no way I could turn the city down (Bri, dim them lights for me)
Up one now, them niggas hate when I'm comin' 'round (Give him space)
