Blowing hundred spending hundred
Like it ain’t nothing
Get money blow more like it ain’t nothing
Jet speed jet motors like it ain’t nothing
Cash money young money
Blowing burning hundreds
She like the money with the power
Flyer than ever the rose pedal with the flower
Walking on this money when we jump about the shower
Hotter than ever luxury life with these models
Pearl white when we jazzy
Bald eagles jump fly on the Harley
Fly shifter new whips class
Big money shit overseas cash
