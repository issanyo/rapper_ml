(Verse 1: Mannie Fresh)
This is for deshawn, eshlawn, lil mama, an her friends
Lisa, teresa, maria, tia, leah and kim
I love yall broads
No disrespect to my dogs
But I love yall broads
Yea I love yall broads
To the ladies
Havin babies
Without no drama
To my niggas
With figgas
Say I love my baby momma
I bought them shoes
And tattoos
An even fixed yo breasts
I put you inside the flyest rides
An even put a "S " on yo chest

(Verse 2: Lil' Wayne)
This is for the ones who pop with it
An be puttin they mouth on it
An they suck everything out of it
Then they catch it an swallow it
I'm Lil Weezy for sheezy
I'm off the heezy believe me
See me
I squeeze in between it
And then I leave it so greasy
When I come through in a Rolls Royce
I leave them with no choice
But to hop up in it an just let me make they throat moist
Ruby Red an Vodka it just carry a nigga
Give me three minutes maybe four she be wantin to marry a nigga

(Chorus: Juvenile)
Give me a project bitch
Give me a hoodrat chick
One that dont give a fuck
An say she took that dick

Give me a project chick
Give me a hoodrat bitch
One that dont give a fuck
An say she took that dick

(Verse 3: Juvenile)
My momma said she seen me by my grandma
My grandma flipped out
An said we ain't gone have no evil in this house
So I rolled out
Scoped me a house an sold out
But I fucked up when I started livin up in this hoes house
Nigga started fuckin one of the broads
Cause she was suckin a nigga dick so good keepin it hard
Lettin a nigga cum all over her chest an tounge
She was still young
Because her children
She was a hoe she gave me head behind a building
Ain't sellin records but her mouth could sell a million
If you wanna take it there we can break it off
Cause yall pussy ain't gotta nigga tweakin at all
I slang this dick summer winter spring an the fall
Ask me to lay it down I'm bringin it all
Im tryin to hit ya from tha back to ya holla good lord
This muthafuckin dick good an it always be hard

(Chorus)

(Verse 4: Baby)
Look look
A nigga could catch me reel up
Them white folks know the code so we g'd up
An my range rover 4 door be d'd up
Tattoos and new cars and these project cuts
Got this nigga bitch I know been wantin to fuck
I deal with sluts, ladies, and bitches dont give a fuck
Project bosses Weezy say respect us
Bitch nigga find me in the 4 door lexus
I got a bitch shoot dice, a bitch that ain't right
I got a bitch who will front ya work an take ya life
I got a credit card hoe
A scam type hoe
A fraud type hoe
Like to snort that dope
A dick suckin pro
A calico hoe
A real solid bitch out chicago
I got a brat type bitch like to whine an shit
I got a project bitch like to start some shit

(Chorus til fade)
