[Intro: Jacquees]
Yeah
I am Jacquess, this is, "Lost At Sea"
Birdman, Jacquees

[Hook: Jacquees]
I'm lost at sea just like a fisher, woah
Say we fallin' off, that's what they wishin' for
Tell the time nigga, that's what we pitchin' for
See these nines, nigga, that's what they pitchin' for
Put my young niggas all in a movie
Cause me and Stunna goin' stupid
Got my right hand on the Remy
Left hand on the toolie
I'm a rich kid, goin' Skooly
BBD, she goin' stupid
Say my diamonds got these bitches choosin'
Countin' money, goin' Juvie
Old nigga, new music
Old hundreds, couple blues
Niggas acting like they knew us
Fuck niggas never knew us

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
See, I just hit 'em with the dice
Say my name, I bet it twice
And me and Stunna have it nice
And me and Stunna shootin' dice
See, pussy niggas be surprised
When Jacquees hit 'em with the price
How Jacquees came up over night
Like I ain't hustle for the price
I swear to God, that we ain't losin'
Me and Stunna goin' stupid
Diamonds water, livin' boogie
Bad bitches in jacuzzis
This shit ain't happen over night
Ain't finna fight, shout out to Bright
And I got Cash Money up under me
And can't none of these niggas stunt on me

[Hook: Jacquees]
I'm lost at sea just like a fisher, woah
Say we fallin' off, that's what they wishin' for
Tell the time nigga, that's what we pitchin' for
See these nines, nigga, that's what they pitchin' for
Put my young niggas all in a movie
Cause me and Stunna goin' stupid
Got my right hand on the Remy
Left hand on the toolie
I'm a rich kid, goin' Skooly
BBD, she goin' stupid
Say my diamonds got these bitches choosin'
Countin' money, goin' Juvie
Old nigga, new music
Old hundreds, couple blues
Niggas acting like they knew us
Fuck niggas never knew us

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Pack it up and ship it off
Stunna been a big boss
Stunna swimmin' with the sharks
Stunna pull up on a loft
CMB been ballin'
Cash Money never fallin'
Whip it up, we gon' ship it by cost
Birdman givin' all this
Get the bird, ship 'em off
Young nigga take the broad with some raw
Raw D, raw D
Stunnaman from way down bottom
Put it in, up in a five-star Jeep
Bizzo!

[Hook: Jacquees]
I'm lost at sea just like a fisher, woah
Say we fallin' off, that's what they wishin' for
Tell the time nigga, that's what we pitchin' for
See these nines, nigga, that's what they pitchin' for
Put my young niggas all in a movie
Cause me and Stunna goin' stupid
