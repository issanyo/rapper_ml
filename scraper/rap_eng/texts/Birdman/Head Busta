[Intro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
You know what it be like?
Sometimes I just have to be that
Better you than me nigga
I would talk, what up K?
Fuck 'em, you heard me

[Refrain:]
Gone get you head busta fuckin' with the homies
Fuckin' with my family nigga, know [?] phonies
Gone get you head busta fuckin with my G's
Fuckin with my G's, pussy niggas gone bleed
Nigga I'm a head busta, yeah I'm a head busta
Nigga bust ya head, mothafucker I'm a head busta
Yeah I'm a head busta, I straight head busta
Empty on these clips, only bitch give you some head bustas

[Verse 1:]
Nigga mac in the 9 homey that's how I roll
Standin' on my throne nigga, I call it home
Chopper for the [?] homey, that's what we use
Knock 'em 'bout the shoes get them pussy nigga blues
High price life, got the whips and the jewels
Murder is a mothafucker, last what we do
Go them for stripes, good with the two
Five star G, never gone loose
On the other side it's just a up town thang
On another hit nigga bring a red paint
Hit it while he slipping, get 'em while he dipping
Call 'em in his car and you know we straight flip 'em
Bouncin' with the chicks, keep the nine on the hip
Lil made nigga and you know I run shit
Gotta get the money, pain and the feuds
Pain what we ride, pain make me do

[Refrain]

[Interlude]
Ya understand me homey
It ain't no love on these streets nigga
Love is the hustle, love is the muscle
Love is the money
I know we get a lot of pain from these streets
It seems like there's no game but

[Verse 2]
Money is the muscle on the streets
But a dufle bag, garbage bag
Play with me nigga, I'ma bust yo' ass
Play with the family, I won't see your whole family cry
Your whole family die nigga, and they wonder why
Ride for soldiers, ride for hustlers
Ride for them real niggas with the muscle
Straight in the situation, niggas got problem homey
Nigga bein' beefin' homey, nigga's being creepin on 'em
Lay them up nigga, put 'em in a shit of bag
Put 'em in a body bag, zip 'em with a toe tag
Sell 'em the whole thang, pull the champ for the tears
Pull the champ for the homies that's not here

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From a nigga 50, he came back with it
Gave him all the game that he want to go and get it
He gave the nigga 20, another nigga 10
And 5 came short, lil when he couldn't win
Lil when couldn't win cuz he fuckin' with the homey
Against a lil nigga and never been phoney
Caught him in his whip, know he couldn't slip
Caught him while he's slipping so you know he gotta flip
The other lil' nigga gave him 20 as a pounce
Told him hold it down and he run up-town
He came back with it but he gave the nigga 5
Nigga play with 'em and you know the nigga die
I gave the nigga 2 hundred on them thangs
He brought it all back nigga, gave me all my chains
Brought 'em one back he play with the change
Nigga don't play so me made those haters swain

[Chorus]
