You can leave for an hour, have money and power
Then turn them on and say you work at the tower
You would love that, you would love that
If you can leave me for an hour, have money and power
Then turn them on and say you work at the tower
You would love that, you would love that

Nigga, get your shit together
And tell the homeboys we gonna shine in the rain weather
Strap up, we gonna ride tonight
Cause all I wanna do is play with hoes tonight
Then my rollas with my brothers speak to the eye
Let my jag drop out, speak to the gold headlights
Man, Im on a all night flight
On a realy, I work about a hundred milli on a rainy night
Im on the hall and my brother here be resting in peace
On my mama glance, on my sister Marie
Man, half of my family already deceased
But this part of life dont mean nothing to me
And make all my whole city love me
Fitted hatch, dance wrap, rees on my feet
Ex leg, playboy, you wont believe me
Besides, all these hoes and all these bros
How let me play, I got the things that I want to keep
Playboy, you can believe me

You can leave for an hour, have money and power
Then turn them on and say you work at the tower
You would love that, you would love that
If you can leave me for an hour, have money and power
Then turn them on and say you work at the tower
You would love that, you would love that
