[Hook: Jacquees]
I seen it all, I done it all, I did it
I just need one time for the one time, is you with it?
I'm still all out pipes when I come 'round in the city
I'm so up right now, right now
‘Cause my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up, my money up, my money up
I got my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up

[Verse 1: Caskey]
Damn, girl, is you with it?
The money coming, fresh printed
The Harley bike's not rented
Windows on the whip tinted
In the kitchen, wrist spinnin'
Money stretch like I come from the powder
I want the money and power
Mama make five digits a year
I need that shit every hour
And I'm smoking on kush out from Cali
That shit going sour
I skrrt on the Ducati bike, going 155
You a bitch, you a coward
We the opposite, do not approach me
The jewelry closet like a ocean
The Cristal bottles toastin'
This pimpin' do not need no coachin'

[Hook: Jacquees]
I seen it all, I done it all, I did it
I just need one time for the one time, is you with it?
I'm still all out pipes when I come 'round in the city
I'm so up right now, right now
‘Cause my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up, my money up, my money up
I got my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Dirty women on it
Slow how we spending on it
Nigga can't see me
‘Cause that Maybach tinted, homie
Versace scarf on me
Givenchy shoes on me
Versace robe on me
Cartier on me
So they wanna know how I did it
How Stunna man still pimpin'
Sold a billion records in the business
Got a million bitches in they feelings
I'm from uptown and I'm a roller
Disrespect a nigga, gon' fold ya
Man be's smoking on golden
Free Jeezy nigga, a young soldier

[Hook: Jacquees]
I seen it all, I done it all, I did it
I just need one time for the one time, is you with it?
I'm still all out pipes when I come 'round in the cities
I'm so up right now, right now
‘Cause my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up, my money up, my money up
I got my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up, my money up, my money up
I done got my money up
