[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Big money talkin' (Talkin')
You smell the money when I walk in (When I walk in)
Yeah I know you probably poppin' (Yeah)
But you know you're just an option (Yeah)
I could lead you to the Lambo (Yeah)
Fuck you good in Gucci sandals (Yeah)
Pussy wetter than in the sea (Yeah)
Let's take a trip to the beach (Yeah)
Let's pop tags (What?)
Would you like that? (Right, would you?)
I'm livin' life fast (Yeah, you know?)
Let's do the whole dash (What? Two-ten)
I'm tryna play with that pussy but I can't drive slow
I know the way I play with this money, I got your mind blown

Better hide your bitch, 'cause I'm that nigga
Twenty bitches, it's just me and Trigga (Trigga)
And all them like it nasty, and them bitches classy (What?)

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Overdosin' this cash flow
Been hoppin' out that four door
Got a hundred G's and we bet more
Got a hundred G's with a hundred more
Playin' games but we livin' life
Five star, been rollin' dice
We'll hit him up then put him down
We'll lay him down for that right price
Them diamonds, boy, been dancin' (Been dancin')
Third Ward live fancy (Live fancy)
High life and we live the life
And we get the money and we clappin' (We clappin')
Hundred hills, we mackin' (We mackin')
Bounce back, straight dappin' (Straight dappin')
Five mics and we done flipped the fame
Got the paper, nigga, with no actin'

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
