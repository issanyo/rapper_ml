Now let's get back on to the last part of bussiness
There is only one word for that, loyalty
Don't forget everybodys gotta be loyal
That's how the bussiness started
That's how everybody got togeether
That's how they got all these fancy cars boats n this n that
We lost couple of guys along the way
But we still strong because of the loyalty that we have, the trust
That's how we stood all these years
So don't forget loyalty
Money... all the money in the world can't buy loyalty
That's something that comes from your heart
Don't forget that
Don't ever forget your roots
Let's keep up the good work
