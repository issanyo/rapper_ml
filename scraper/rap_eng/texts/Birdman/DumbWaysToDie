This is a rap about Dumb Ways To Die. Play with me and you won't believe your eyes. They have multiple reasons you shouldn't mess with me and all this explains why. With the Glock I got aim. You don't want me to put you in shame. BlackBandit is my name. I don't play cause I'm not no game. You a rookie while I'm a legend in a hall of fame


Nigga diving in that water head face who gone save him. Don't have no patience. Shoot with no hesitation. Now I'm on probation. I should've shoot that lady. She went back and gave my name to the police at the police station. At night wear a mask on with all black inkjet Dark Vader. Gone to teach you a lesson like you was a fable
