[Hook: Young Thug]
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian
Told my baby next February we're married
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Yeah, we roll these bitches like they centipedes
We get this money, flip some hundreds then we blow some Gs
I gave her life and then I showed her Bs
We fucked the world but now we overseas
Inside of the car, we stashed a hundred bricks
We put it down and hit the town, we 'bout the money trips
Wait, the ice is rollin' cause we're rollin', bitch
Flakes, the dope is colda cause we're polar, bitch
I answer the call and put her right beside me
Two, we 'bout that woop like them brand new Spyders
Keep your mouth closed, boy, cause we're aim and fire
I just might one night her, show love and wife her
I'm bangin' green like the lizard in Geico
I pull up and wet you, burn your top like Michael
I got bullets bigger than fingers in rifles
It's big Bs with a hundred Gs in each one of my pockets

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm not gon' pass, I'ma smash 'em
She want that nut so I blast her
My Bentley grey like a pastor
Whippin' that snow, no Alaska
Good head, she got her masters
Shawty a long way from dumb
Your money flat like a plasma
Good kush, smoke is the bomb
I drink that Act while you be drinkin' red
I don't fall in love, I run over it instead
Hey, babe, bobble, that big ol' head
I'm like, "lil baby, I don't know your kid"
I keep my pistol I'll give you the lead
They 3 deep I call 'em Ed, Edd and Eddy
Baby take a picture,  get that photo cred
She make me lean back like a sofa bed
