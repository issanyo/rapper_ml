[Chorus x2]
Bitch I love my hood nigga, back in my hood
Them houses back up, bitch we up to no good
Flier than ever, do whatever
Live this life, let me spend this cheddar

[Verse 1]
Blowin' on that ganja, fresh out the pound
Represent mines bitch straight uptown
Flamed up nigga every time I come around
Its the Birdman, nigga got the game off the ground
Role with a chopper, ride with a gun
Doin' my thing nigga, me and my son
Just like that nigga do it like that
I'm the number one stunner bitch, how you love that?
Hat stay low, 250 on the glow
The new Jacob watch bitch, had to have the hoe
The water came first then it fucked up the flow
Fucked yup the coke and the dope and the dro
Bounced back bitch, nigga had to get more
You know how we do it, get the cash off the flow
Every nigga in my hood took that loss
I made other nigga neighborhoods pay that cost
One hunnid

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Nigga bubbly Chrissy, she's so with me
Ride so fly nigga, the hood all in me
Till I die, these niggas goin' feel me
5 story condo, my G's ride with me
Straight up blood, that's my love
Agreed to the 17th, we came up tough
Crab in a bucket, uptown fuck it
If I pull this motherfucker I'ma pop this motherfucker
Love my hood, I get down for my hood
Ride for my homies out the neck of my woods
And took your haters out for one of your tomatoes
Creep up on your bitch and I'ma work it like a label
Stuntin' on them pussies, G4 nigga
Phantom and the Range Rover paid out nigga
5 star hotel, mommy is a model
G'd up bitch and we be drinkin' out the bottle nigga

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
I miss my mama, love my daddy
Rode for my other brother, put that nigga in a caddy
Divorced a freak but married to the game
Doing my thing bitch, gettin' this change
Uptown madness, so sadness
Spend that corner, everybody had to have it
Slangin' that iron, don't mind dying
Have your whole neighborhood out cryin'
Love your life nigga if thats your son
Fuckin' with this bitch, you won't have one
Lord to my hood, never leave my hood
Blood on the concrete nigga my wood
[?] no lie, I tell you no lie
That nigga wouldn't have died, he still would have died
The blood in my eyes wouldn't have let it ride
I watched the whole motherfuckin' neighborhood cry

[Chorus x2]
