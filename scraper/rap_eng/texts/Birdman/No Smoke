[Hook- Velous]
Moving them keys like piano man
I get it straight off the boat
To the red light, green light my hitters ready to go
Just to whip around the foreign
I had to whip on the stove
Ask about us boy they really know
All they do is blow smoke
But they don't want no smoke (no, no, no)
They don't want no smoke

Made a million in that trap house
Count it all 'till I passed out
Woke up to another pile
Had 'em thinking I cashed out
King AB I run it, they rap I done it
Avatars in my pockets, talking bout blue hundreds
Put it all in the ceiling, too heavy for the mattress
40 laying on my dresser, two clips for the actors
NASCAR like vroom vroom, red light blow past ya
I was born for the drama, you don't want no action
You don't want no smoke, green light on go
I'll rob the whole city 'fore I go broke
Counted a hundred fifty off of snow
This time last year I was stuck at the stove

Just me and my wrist, water whipping that kitchen
VisionWare on the stove, quarter brick in them dishes
About a half in that water, locking up when it swimming
All my hitters on post, ready set positions
FN no holster, we ain't got no issues
Team full of killers, send them boys to come get you
Snatch you out that Bentley, who the fuck ya'll kidding
I don't play no balls, you know I run my city
Pulled up at a dice game, lost a half a ticket
All I know that thing got wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
God bless my hitters, knee deep in them trenches
All for the shoot king, aiming with precision
