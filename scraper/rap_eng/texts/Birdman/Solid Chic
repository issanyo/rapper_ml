[Verse 1: Birdman]
My shaudy off the block, she be solid hot
Know a nigga on the grind, when the jewlls be on lock
She be playing her role, like a g support
She wanted love, so I went and bought her 22
I be on the grind, my bitch be too
Let her live this hood rich life however she want to
And I put her on the jam ? that ass
She the first in the hood delivering slabs
And I be in the hood, and I be chacing paper
Dropping off, then picking up in the escolator
And where I'm from, them hoes get done too
That's why I tell my ho to peep out a real view
I gave her game, nigga, since a lil young thang
Stay strong, know the chances in the fast lane
And I'm the only nigga that my bitch look at
We stay focused on the grind, how you love that

[Hook: Lil Mo]
Baby, can't you see
When you're available, ain't no moving me
Like a rock, I'm solid
You was in the streets, now spending money like ain't a thing
Turning dreams into reality
Boy, believe
Cause I'm so solid

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Another nigga out the hood with a solid chick
I been down, nigga, I ain't had shit
And I remember when we slept on the floor
Got my first bird in the hood on the down low
And my little brother wrote the script on how to pimp a bitch
And getting money worldwide and stay hood rich
And I prommis you homie, I'll give it right back
You'll see Mouse pull up in a Catolac
And my shaudy, homie, she G'd up in G ways
And cook a nigga a hot meal, like every day
And I'm rich, nigga, hoes all on my dick
It's kinda hard for me to trust a brand new bitch
I tell my shauty every day that I got her
If you keep it solid, you know a nigga gonna rock
My baby mama, nigga, straight out of Cali, ho
We from the bricks, to the wood, to the Hali Grove

[Hook: Lil Mo]
Baby, can't you see
When you're available, ain't no moving me
Like a rock, I'm solid
You was in the streets, now spending money like ain't a thing
Turning dreams into reality
Boy, believe
Cause I'm so solid

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Now, let me tell you what I like about a project bitch
We been all around the gloab, fuckin with it
And that's when, me and my high boy clique with the shit
Manny Fresh, put it down, with them platnom hits
We stayed on the grinde, probably get them 1s up
In my neck of the woods, never put them guns up
I've been around, got this gang straight off the floor
My nigga Gray told me how to get doe
I see this fassion on this hood rich shit
I gotta get shots, so mama, what you doing
My lil sister, yeah, she solid as fuck
She had bread at a young age, we living ?

[Hook: Lil Mo]
Baby, can't you see
When you're available, ain't no moving me
Like a rock, I'm solid
You was in the streets, now spending money like ain't a thing
Turning dreams into reality
Boy, believe
Cause I'm so solid
