[Hook - Kevin Rudolf]
Here we are, we are the champions
We’ve come so far, they said it can’t be done
And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions

[Verse 1 - Fred Durst]
Check it, always had big hopes as a kid
Just a rotten tomato building shit out of Legos
Can’t hit the ball if you ain’t swingin’ the bat
And like a home run, that boy is not coming back
Rise like creams, kid with a dream
Went from never seeing straight to the face on a magazine
Now my team got anthems
Y’all frozen, a cold hook from the champion

[Hook - Kevin Rudolf (Fred Durst)]
Here we are, we are the champions (YMCMB)
We’ve come so far, they said it can’t be done
And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions

[Verse 2 - Kevin Rudolf]
You know you gotta be strong to survive
When everyone’s trying to break you
So let ‘em hate, just go your own way
Don’t ever let ‘em try and change you
I walk alone through the fire to the throne
I find myself in the dark, I close my eyes and there you are

[Hook - Kevin Rudolf (Birdman)]
Here we are, we are the champions
We’ve come so far, they said it can’t be done
And we right here, and we still number one (yeah)
Still number one, still number one (yeah)
So here we are, we are the champions (Stunna, check me)

[Verse 3 - Birdman]
Rich gang, from Forbes to fortune and fame
Spit game, from millions to billions to gain
Life, triple crown on them bright lights
Sunny days, rainy nights on them global flights
Yeah, the like father, like son struggle
Mo’ muscle, gun bussa, we flip digits
TRUK fitted, go get it
Ship it cause it’s bigger than life

[Hook - Kevin Rudolf (Lil Wayne)]
Here we are, we are the champions
We’ve come so far, they said it can’t be done
And we right here, and we still number one
Still number one, still number one
So here we are, we are the champions (yeah)

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne]
Uh, number one in this motherfucker
Lil Weezy fuck the world with two rubbers
But in the meantime I’mma have a nice time
Went from a con artist to an icon
Got the keys to success on my key ring
Used to dream about sugar, sweet dreams
But reality is a bitch and she my bitch
Sold my soul to the devil, made a profit
Tunechi

[Hook - Kevin Rudolf (Lil Wayne)]
Here we are, we are the champions (yeah, haha)
We’ve come so far, they said it can’t be done (pour some Gatorade on it)
And we right here, and we still number one (ah, yeah, yeahh)
Still number one, still number one (oh yeah)
So here we are, we are the champions (I almost forgot)
(Young Mula babyyy)
