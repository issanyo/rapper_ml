[Verse 1]
Now watch me break em up
Tape em up
Gun up in his face
I be like straighten up
Do make me bust
Run up in this place
I put my K to her and Uzi to him
I woosy from gin
Like shut up or get two to your chin
You and your friend ??? how they do it in the pen
I'm kinda off
The 90 sparks give a damn bout your car
I'm behind the tips of the Excursion
Drunk and swervin'
Your mom was twerkin
Don't be jerkin in the middle of ???
I heard he got the murders so I'm going to get 'em
His boys are trippin so now I got his ma and children
Plus I slid inside tha back of A
96 Acura
Click-Clack and A
Black automatic Cataca
Bitches got me rataca
Pistols out to damage ya
I swear i'll have this broads brains over the Avena
Mario and Samua
Screamin' man blast her brah
Now you reall askin fa
A motherfuckin massaca

Chorus: Baby, (Lac)

Put it on the streets and let em cook up and wiegh up
Put it on his ass if he don't hook up then pay up

(Nigga if you got lets continue to deal)
(If you move twenty birds I consider you real)

Put it on the streets and let em cook up and wiegh up
Put it on his ass if he don't hook up then pay up
I, put it on the streets and let em cook up and wiegh up
Put it on his ass if he don't hook up then pay up

(Nigga if you got lets continue to deal)
(If you move twenty birds I consider you real)

What, put it on the streets and let em cook up and wiegh up
Put it on his ass if he don't hook up then pay up
