[Chorus: Hurricane Chris]
I'm in the club hollering
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay
I'm in the club hollering

[Verse 1: Game]
You can find me in the a bay bay
Bucket full of cry-stal V.I.Ped up
Going hard in body tap where they throw that cheese up
I been about my paper niggas know about my stack
You don't like that dirty money send your girl to wipe me down
Million dollars on my neck and wrist shine for a mile
She wanna see it up close then she gotta walk it out
I'm the king of this rap shit what the fuck they talking 'bout
Niggas can't sell records so they blame it on the South
I be all through Shreveport, Louisiana ballin'
Like who the fuck said ain't no choppers in New Orleans
My rims so clean they spinning like a whirlwind
Pull up at the club bitches texting they girlfriends
They know who I is they know who I am
I be flying through the south in that burgundy Lam'
Pull up at the light my shit so bright
She want my number shit call me tonight
Pick up the phone like

[Verse 2: Hurricane Chris]
Well its the H to tha U double R I C-A-N to tha E Get em up, Get em up, Get em up like
A bay bay that's what we say when we pull up in them trucks
Tell my label to cut the check I'mma go and spend it up
On the Bentley painted yellow like a baby school bus
26's make em stop when I pull up
And my pants sag low like I was rockin' a pull-up
When I stop and I pull up, I'mma be already full of Vodka
I keep that in my cup a bay bay on make me bussa
And if you try to take my chain I'mma snatch yo face off
I got diamonds in my ear the same size as baseballs
Where they at? They lost I don't thank they on my level
Lil mama thank I'mma bite her with this alligator sweater
A bay bay was just the beginning I'm finna run the game
Whoever feel different can holla at Hurricane
Wanna be talking but heavy itinerary break up yo chest if you running yo mouth
And every since I dropped that a bay bay I been running the South

[Chorus: Hurricane Chris]
I'm in the club hollering
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay
I'm in the club hollering

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
A bay bay it's Lil Boosie
This for my dawgs who keep that cake and keep that uzi
Holla a bay bay
One eighty seven'm two eleven'm on my side of town
E'erbody riding 'round A bay bay fuck naw
Rubberbands round cash I'm making cake
A bay bay what we gone eat today I want me some steak
Paint the caddy candy green hey bay bay
Anybody try to hate they gone feel that
In Baton Rouge keep a big bitch, attitude real rude
L.I.G I'm real cool don't thank that I'm a lil' dude
Beef to me like bar-b-que it's nothing at all
Thought that ratchet was a fool a bay bay goin' off

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Say that red hat them red B's wife B's
23's out the Bentley and we stay fly
Hundred G's P-R-P's hum V's
We D-boys getting money on them 25's
5 star and that's me, a O.G
I'm from the three the thirteenth off the wild side
My young G and he a beast Tha Carter 3
That's more stuntin' but we hustlin' like it's do or die

[Chorus: Hurricane Chris]
I'm in the club hollering
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay
I'm in the club hollering

[Verse 5: Angie Locc]
Ratchet dancing cross the floor you know the g-way
Hollerin' uuhh up on the mic with the DJ
I'm with my G's and my thugs and my ese's
Hiding 'hind the shades I been up for bout three days
Cut with curls in my hair got my L's in tha air
Waistin' drank everywhere 'cuz I 'cuz I don't care
With my niggas out that lava and you know we bad off
We the ones up in the cut with them blunts that make you cough
Trued all the way down from my head to my feet
I can't feel my face so please don't speak
You wanna know what we do when the club get packed?
What? Toss my set, raise my shirt, show that tat up on my back

[Verse 6: Jadakiss]
Yo look it ain't a game, 50 large is what I came with
25 for bottles 25 to make it rain with
This ain't Reggie Miller ma, this is kush and haze mixed
Donâ€™t sit there and lie to me, you ain't never taste this
Hope the Lord forgive me gave my Jesus piece a face-lift
Stones is doing the Watusi in the bracelet
Ain't no stoppin' that, I be where the guap is at
Excuse me, I be wherever it's poppin' at
Now I'm on the dance floor, iced out, lights out
Wife-beater, true religion shorts and my Nikes out
Drinkin' out the bottle talking much shit, Dutch lit
Every bunny within arms reach wanna touch Kiss
Yes, and when I leave they all followin', just 'cuz I was in the club hollerin'

[Outro]
A bay bay, a bay bay
