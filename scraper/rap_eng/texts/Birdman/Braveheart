[Verse 1]
I'm on that late night come and get
I'm on that ripped jeans cigarette
And the whole world stops, it's turning
As the love fills up our lungs
I'm on that club ground battle scars
I'm on that 3 A.M. bizare
And the whole world stops, it's turning
As the love fills up our lungs

[Pre-Hook]
These sweet dreams in motion
Feelings take over
Memories wide open
Summer keeps calling

[Hook]
Braveheart
Show me what you got
Gotta show me when the beat drops
Braveheart
Show me what you got
Gotta show me when the beat drops

Ichi, ni, san, kaesu

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Breathe me in I'll take you higher
Eat me up like wild fire
And the whole world stops, it's turning
As the love fills up our lungs

[Pre-Hook]
These sweet dreams in motion
Feelings take over
Memories wide open
Summer keeps calling

[Hook]
Braveheart
Show me what you got
Gotta show me when the beat drops
Braveheart
Show me what you got
Gotta show me when the beat drops

[Post-Hook]
Show me what you got
Show me, show me (beat drops)
Show me what you got
Show me, show me (beat drops)

[Bridge]
Talkin' bout fresh
We talkin' bout lettuce
All the things
That the lifestyle get us
Stacking cheddar
Chopping feta
If you see my ex
Tell the bitch
Don't sweat us

How many girls you know
Rock lettuce like this
LV on my back
Chanel on my wrist
Js on my feet
What's a bouji, bitch?

Hipster chick
I ain't with that shit
Stone cold rosetta
OG go-getter
Kick game at me
Do you one better
If your girl wanna roll
I just might let her

[Pre-Hook]
These sweet dreams in motion
Feelings take over
Memories wide open
Summer keeps calling

[Hook]
Braveheart
Show me what you got
Gotta show me when the beat drops
Braveheart
Show me what you got
Gotta show me when the beat drops

Ichi, ni, san, kaesu

[Instrumental]
