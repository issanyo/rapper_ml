[Chorus: Birdman]
Baller blockin' on me, nigga, baller blockin' my feet, nigga
Baller blockin' that D, baller blockin' my G
Baller blockin' my hoes, nigga, baller blockin' my woes, nigga
Baller blockin' my shows, Baller blockin', get fold

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Got a gold bullet with a gold chopper, paid niggas, grill stopper
Paper plates on hella choppers, foreign whips with stash spots
Red niggas, fuck you, that spray a nigga, then buck him
They play nigga, we lay 'em down, we pull 'em down so fuck him nigga
Fourth, I did it, done it, they sayin' that's the old money
Fuck nigga, been talkin' shit but I been the nigga with money so
Brand niggas get sprayed again, they come around my way
Nigga I come from old school ways, nigga I know how to get paid nigga
I'm a old head and I'm hot, them platinum walls up top
Versace all on me nigga, I been about my block
I been about this money, nigga, you not in the huddle, so watch
Marble under my feet, nigga, Third Ward I'm a G, nigga

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon & Birdman]
I came from nothin', I'm doin' somethin', they don't like that
I left the hood, ran the money up, came right back
Now why they balla blockin', they balla blockin', they balla blockin'
Now why they balla blockin', they balla blockin', they balla blockin'
Baller blockin' on me, nigga, baller blockin' my feet, nigga
Baller blockin' that D, baller blockin' my G
Baller blockin' my hoes, nigga, baller blockin' my woes, nigga
Baller blockin' my shows, Baller blockin', get fold

[Verse 2: Birdman]
She laced me with a lick so I told the ho I flip bricks
She lined me up with a couple pussy nigga, you know I took they shit
Them full clips, we lit, you know we took they shit
Uptown, we put it down and I done came up on a lick
Big money, no stuntin', we huntin' nigga, rep huntin'
It's fam nigga, this ball time, we put it down for that money
Get your money right, you won't beef nigga
Get your money right, with no sleep nigga
Get your money right, you won't creep nigga
Get your money right, big feast nigga
Playin' nigga, get you fucked up
Play a nigga and get fucked up
Playin' niggas get fucked up
Playin' nigga, get fucked up
These square niggas get fucked up
Talkin' bright and they lucked up
Showin' niggas we hustle nigga
We put it down and we came up

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon & Birdman]
I came from nothin', I'm doin' somethin', they don't like that
I left the hood, ran the money up, came right back
Now why they balla blockin', they balla blockin', they balla blockin'
Now why they balla blockin', they balla blockin', they balla blockin'
Baller blockin' on me, nigga, baller blockin' my feet, nigga
Baller blockin' that D, baller blockin' my G
Baller blockin' my hoes, nigga, baller blockin' my woes, nigga
Baller blockin' my shows, Baller blockin', get fold
