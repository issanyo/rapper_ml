[Intro]
Yo nigga, you know sometimes you can lose shit, get shit back
You know like hustlin', bounce right back
Get right back up on 'em niggas
But in this thing we call life homie, it ain't no 2 strikes, 2 chance
You got one shot at it, so you know what I do with it nigga
I ball 'till I fall, stun 'till I die, one hundred

[Hook]
Rest in peace to my momma, rest in peace to my daddy
Rest in peace to my homie, rest in peace to my family
Rest in peace to my D boy, my OG boy, told me be a B boy
Rest in peace to my cuz, money was the love
Disrespect me bitches its murder up in bloods
Rest in peace to my homies in the pen
Ain't comin' home and they know they  can't win

My homie momma died he was 5
Brought him to the street life taught 'em to survive
Blocc was his daddy, tatts in the caddy now
Blowin' on that gonja lil' nigga had to have it huh
Full of that aroma, gun alone taught 'em the corner
Nigga life in the streets homie up in the mornin'
See we G's fuckin' with these flees
Work in they house and you know we got to eat
Youngster wanna be, a gangster like me
I let 'em all see so they know how it be
Streets is a motherfuckin' game of life
Playin' the hard part of it is livin' it twice
Fresh with the money now, cruisin' in the Lambo
Time to change dpe, but niggas still the same though
Bitches with the murder, murder with the bitches
Homies in my hood nigga trippin' bout they riches

[Hook]

See my homie caught life, couldn't do it twice
He hear a court order on the street that night
Nobody trippin' but the hood be flippin'
On the laws, fuck 'em out they jaws
Fuck 'em in they cars
You know my hood, we don't spare nothin' blood
You know my streets nigga fucked up in the mud
You know the cost when you playin' with the boss
Your life is lost when your playin' with boss
We in the club, showin' some hoes love
Nigga want trip but I keep his ho hugged
He killed my homie nigga but he didn't kill his family though
I'ma real nigga so I'm ridin' for his family ho
Got to get the cheese flippin' these B's
Fuckin' with these hoes, burn a few G's
Playin' the game right while up in these buildings
Tryin' to be the next billion

[Hook]

So I roll with my heater, ridin' with my heater
Never leave my bitch, call her millimeter
Cruise with my ho, on the road with my ho
Nigga hustle with my ho, nigga fuck with my ho
Never leave my bitch she hard core rich
Purely white top nigga, ain't hit quick
16 nigga better yet banana clip
Gotta brother names chopper nigga break down bricks
45 snub met his whole blood
2, 2, 6 nigga that uptown plug
Flippin' through the curb, gave the homie word
Penitentiary chance when fuckin' with them birds
Back to my block though, millions won't stop ho
From the bottom to the top with this cash flow
I'm in my caddy bitch, livin' lavish bitch
Livin' with the homie nigga quick to grab my shit

[Hook]
