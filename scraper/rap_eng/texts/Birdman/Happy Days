[Chorus]
We got problems, we got pain
We got issues, we're insane
We got stacks of bills to pay
It's getting darker every day
Pills to stay up, pills to sleep
Fill prescription, therapy
Doctor aren't we just a smile away
From happy days

[Verse 1]
I bought a six pack of freedom
Ten pack of pride
Losing the streets, and I'm feeling alive
Cigars and Sinatra
Sparking some flames
Killing me softly
Kiss me again

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know now you know
Wheels keep spinning
If you don't know now you know
Champagne killin'
(Sittin' on the hood of my Chevy singing)

[Chorus]
We got problems, we got pain
We got issues, we're insane
We got stacks of bills to pay
It's getting darker every day
Pills to stay up, pills to sleep
Fill prescription, therapy
Doctor aren't we just a smile away
From happy days, happy days

[Verse 2]
River of vapors got me straight in the zone
No sign of a hater in this rose tinted smoke, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know now you know
Wheels keep spinning
If you don't know now you know
Champagne killin'
(Sittin' on the hood of chevy singing)

[Chorus]
We got problems, we got pain
We got issues, we're insane
We got stacks of bills to pay
It's getting darker every day
Pills to stay up, pills to sleep
Fill prescription, therapy
Doctor aren't we just a smile away
From happy days, happy day
(Sittin' on the hood of chevy chevy)

[Bridge]
Do it for the love, and make you feel good
Steady goin' up, and make you feel good
Rain, rain, go away
Just bring me my happy days
Do it for the love, and make you feel good
Steady goin' up, and make you feel good
Rain, rain, go away
Just bring me my happy days

Sittin' on the hood of chevy, chevy
Sittin' on the hood of my chevy, chevy
'Bout to to roll up some heavy, heavy
'Bout to light up some heavy, heavy
Sittin' on the hood of chevy, chevy
Sittin' on the hood of my chevy, chevy
'Bout to to roll up some heavy, heavy
'Bout to light up some heavy, heavy

[Chorus]
We got problems, we got pain
We got issues, we're insane
We got stacks of bills to pay
It's getting darker every day
Pills to stay up, pills to sleep
Fill prescription, therapy
Doctor aren't we just a smile away
From happy days, happy days
