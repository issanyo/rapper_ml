[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Move, mu... shoot with that {316 Production}
And if you can't feel it I'mma touch ya
Nothin' makes a situation better than chedda
And I'm cuttin' through that cheese like a Shredder
So I guess I'm famous like a Ninja Turtle
But I ain't got nothin', nothin' but money
Cuz if I don't do, if I don't do

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
If I don't do nothin' I'mma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy
Say go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy (Get money)
I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' (Remix baby)
Look honey, I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' (Get money)

[Lil Wayne]
+Tha Block is Hot+, the flow is so ice cold
Walkin' into the bank, honey I am home
I am on that shit they got me dancin' on
Anotha planet to a screwed Janet Jackson song
I talk real crazy, but they still pay me
Said goodbye to the game, but I'm still wavin'
And no disrespect to the lil' ladies
But fuck nine months, I hustle all year baby
All yeah baby, I know you lovin' that
DB with a DB, dope boy wit a duffle bag
Wit a duffle bag, Tity put it in the air
Call me Mr. President or call me Mr. Every Pair
Or Mr. Everywhere or Mr. Never Care
Or Mr. Never Scared, no you could never scare
Me, yeah me in the kitchen wit that big pot
Bitch I'm on my, bitch I'm on my tick tock, tick tock

[Hook]

{New Playaz Circle}

[Dolla Boy]
Hail to the streets, cuz the streets is what made me
Still the same I hate hoes and they hate me
If a nigga owe me, believe he gon pay me
I signed wit Def Jam but I don't know Jay-Z
Beat the, beat the death like Weezy F Baby
Just like Khaled say "We the Best, We the Best"
Duffle bag boys Dolla Tit ya wanna meet the rest
Big Cap, J dot, beats that's hot

[Tity Boi]
Yes I am a beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I don't wanna talk I let my fo' fo' speak
And I like my Sprite Pepto pink
Yeah I get moola, I put work on a ruler
I like good brain, but I'm lookin for a tutor
I got on so much jewlery that I feel like a cooler
But cooler, ya dig?

[Hook]

[Juelz Santana]
I'mma get 'em my attention
Ok Dipset, Santana, let's go, ya dig?

Aye I push those whips, pass those hoes
Got a money overload, my duffle bag won't close (uh oh)
I'm driving by, you just standin' starin'
We flyin' high, you just prepare for landin'
I'm so fresh from my stitchin' to my belt
From my jewels to my shoes, I take pictures of myself (Cheese)
And that money's my wife, she ain't signin' a prenup
She gon love me for life (why), cuz I know how to treat her

[Birdman]
Stunna Man so I'm headin' to the Phantom shop
Cop 3 now I'm headin' to the rim shop
Took a Jet to Jersey on Ms. Lee's island
You know me homey, bout this money and power
Big, timin', straight, hustlin'
Up-town, wit the, muscle
Get, money, dark, shades
Stay, high, ready, spray
