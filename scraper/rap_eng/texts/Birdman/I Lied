[Intro]
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

[Verse 1]
Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said "let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love, then you cut me loose?
You just a heart breaker, won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines

[Hook]
I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

[Verse 2]
Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities, and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

[Bridge]
I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d do, if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I'm afraid of you

[Outro]
So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you?
It’s all good now
Goodbye now
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart forever
