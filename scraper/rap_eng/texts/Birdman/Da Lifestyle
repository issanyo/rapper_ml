[Intro: Birdman & Jacquees]
Miami palm trees, 305 lifestyle
Lost at sea
Can’t see nothing but the water, no dry land
Even with binoculars nigga

[Verse 1: Birdman]
It’s ‘Sace on the road, [?] all gold
Chandelier paper, real never fold
Kick it while we dip it, and riding on them 4’s
Goal play the chopper, everywhere I go
See them lil niggas know me, know me
I get money like an OG
Show me, I show the lil nigga moldy, moldy
Cause we do it for the money, the money

[Hook: Jacquees]
I take you from this place, let me bring you with the crew
You know I’m spending cake and tonight it’s all on you
So tell me what it take to get you inside my room
I put G inside your cup, I’ma show you what I do tonight
I know you’re fed up
Cause he won’t do it to you right
I put you on this lifestyle right now
Ain’t got a man, but how it sound?

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
I, jump in the coupe like Stunna, I
Smashed the daughter, Stunna smashing the momma, I
Got too much, check come with a comma now
I got so much, take care of my momma now
Can’t you see what’s going on
(I live like) every day’s my birthday and every day I’m home
(Now what’s the) prices baby, I just want to show you what I’m on
(I might just) fly you to the island baby, you ain’t going home
You ain’t going home

[Hook: Jacquees]
I take you from this place, let me bring you with the crew
You know I’m spending cake and tonight it’s all on you
So tell me what it take to get you inside my room
I put G inside your cup, I’ma show you what I do tonight
I know you’re fed up
Cause he won’t do it to you right
I put you on this lifestyle right now
Ain’t got a man, but how it sound?

[Outro: Jacquees]
I do this every day, we can do this every day
