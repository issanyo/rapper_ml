[Pre-Hook: Amira (Shereen)]
Tonight I'll hunt you down
Boy can you make me growl
With the wild things on the prowl
(Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle)
(jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle.....)

[Hook: Jessica (Amira)]
La la la la la la
(La di da di hands on my body)
La la la la la la
(oh just love me down)
La la la la la la
(La di da di hands on my body)
La la la la la la
(oh just love me down)

[Verse 1: Asami (Shereen)]
See them boy hit me up at the bar
Dark and smooth like a jaguar
Ask one time and I’ll make you my star
(And you know you want to)
[Jessica (Shereen)]
If you wanna get deep in the club
Must refer up give it up time for love
Only one winner one bad man time
(And you know I want you)

[Pre-Hook]
Tonight I'll hunt you down
Boy can you make me growl
With the wild things on the prowl
(Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle)
(jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle.....)

[Hook]
La la la la la la
(La di da di hands on my body)
La la la la la la
(oh just love me down)
La la la la la la
(La di da di hands on my body)
La la la la la la
(oh just love me down)

[Verse 2: Jessica (Shereen)]
When you hungry then I'll be your cow
Come now help me with the kids’ cat purr
Top of the food chain, top of the world
(And you know you want to)
[Asami (Shereen)]
On your close unpredictable
One on one, done wild animal
Instant kicks and I can’t control
(And you know I want you
Welcome to the jungle)

[Bridge: Amira (Jessica)]
Beat it up like Rocky, no ASAP
Cop game like 8 track
You want that I stay strapped
You knocked down, don't say that
(Super faded, ready gone
She super bad, hardly wrong
Do your dance but they play my song
Excuse me shawty, you o-o-owned
True thrill and I'm sorry)
Got two seats in this 'rari
For this pussy popping safari
So fuck it, let's party
It’s two cliques, one crew
(Two twos and my two coops)
Girl do you but let me too

[Break/Beat: Shereen]
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle

[Outro: Amira (Shereen)]
Tonight I'll hunt you down
Boy can you make me growl
With the wild things on the prowl
(Welcome to the jungle)
