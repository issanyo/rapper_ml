Go go go go go go go shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!
You can find me in the club bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
When I pull out up front you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit with a few shells but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go
You can find me in the club bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
My flow my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib my cars my pools my jewels
Look nigga I done came up and I ain't change
And you should love it way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumpin in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire let the mother fucker burn
If you talking bout money homie I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there with a bottle of bub
You know where we fucking be
You can find me in the club bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
