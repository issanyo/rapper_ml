[Intro: Birdman + Robb Banks]
First off all, if you niggas is not listenin' to Molly
On some G shit
Still rainin', it's pourin'
Still ridin' foreign
The hottest shit right now
To me
That Rich Gang or don't bang
My personal opinion
Gangsters fuckin' with that bitch
Besides, you know, you got Jacquees and them boys
Rockin' that all that big shit, you dig what I'm sayin'?
You heard me? Them niggas fly, but they shit
But on that rap shit?
G shit
Molly
Tuh, no sweet shit
Poppin' on that G shit
That hood rich, G nigga, rich nigga
You heard me?
Ridin' through in that double R
The niggas who ain't gotta try to go and get it
In that Monte Carlo
Poppin' it all, with it, all in it, anything that try to come to get it
Bird call
Y'all niggas slippin' out there
Shit, I been watchin' y'all bitch ass niggas
Y'all niggas slippin', nigga
Turn it up louder for me
Y'all on that sucker ass shit, been a sucker nigga
Yeah, keep that shit goin'
That's why you sucker ass niggas ain't got money, nigga
Falconia lifestyle
Y'all pussy niggas runnin' around with your crumbs
You heard?
Open up the gates
Rich Gang lifestyle, know what I'm sayin'
Rich nigga shit, bitch
Rich Gang

[Verse]
How you want that shit? How you want that shit?
How you want it?
Bend that corner bitch, who you rollin' with?
Pull up on ya
We ain't foldin' shit, you ain't holdin' shit
Get up off me
Said I love the bitch and I ain't fuck the bitch
Green hearted
She hopped on my stick and that bitch rode my shit
I know she loved it
She know all my shit and she save all my pics
I caught her stalkin'
Put a beam on my stick, with a iced out wrist
Kiss her neck and the pussy flooded
Big Glock got a lil kick, you a top notch bitch
If you bad, I'll let you bust it
I just bought a matte black Rarri
In the coupe, passed out on shawty
No roof like Wayne, how I'm bomin'
She a midget cause she got lil body
And my new shit harder than the hardest
Not a rapper, I'm a motherfuckin' artist
Tell the truth, y'all new niggas targets
Blue tips in the bottom of the cartridge
Boy, you take a shot and you scheme
Know you tweak, put your bitch on my team
You the sideline, I'm MVP, and I’m drunk off lean
I don’t give a fuck, I just popped three
Got a square and drive HB, hit the wheel with my ring
Put a 12 right behind my V
I don't like y'all, you don't like me
Tell the truth you sweet, I'ma keep this shit all the way G
