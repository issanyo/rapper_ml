[Hook: Money Man]
Please do not fuck with my energy
I'm full of GTV and Hennessy
I'm limitless, no you can't limit me
A couple rappers tryna mimic me
She said she tryna come and visit me
So many plays I can barley drop verse
She backed it up then she start twerk, yeaaaa
I'mma go get the check that's for certain
I'mma go get a bag that's for certain
She tryna let me hit that's for certain
Everytime I come around she get nervous
They see them sticks around they get nervous
I'mma go get it that's for certain
I'mma go get it that's for certain

[Verse 1:Money Man]
I keep them sticks that's for certain
I see you pussy niggas lurkin
Oh that's the plug, guess what? I serve him
She wanna hit the room and take it further
You ain't hot, you luke warm, nigga
Ballin' got the perfect form, nigga
Lil' mama don't rap but I'mma sign her
I get it in on a freight liner
I got them stripes on me like a tiger
Burn a lil' nigga like a lighter
Burn a lil' nigga like a fire
I seen a pound and got inspired
I seen her shape and got inspired
12 hit the door, don't wanna be reminded
Got robbed one time and it turned me violent
We move in secrecy and silence

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Rich gang or don't bang, nigga
Ridin' round withe flame, nigga
Maybach got a stick in it
And it got a nigga bitch, my nigga Rich caught 5 keys
She not religious but she on her knees
She told me satisfy a nigga needs
I'm on the yacht rollin' up flexing
Niggas hate it when you get successful
Fuck all them rumors, nigga I'm a boss
Fuck all that talkin' y'all niggas lost
Catch wit them niggas, you ain't got the sauce
Lil' mama tryna come, top me off
I'mma just relaxin on Stunna Island
You see the class and all these diamonds
She get on top, then she start ridin'
