[Verse 1]
That's you with that bad ass Benz ha
That's you that can't keep your old lady
Cause you keep fuckin' her friends ha
You gotta go to court ha
You got served a subpoena for child support ha
That was that nerve ha
You ain't even much get a chance to say a word ha
I know I ain't trippin' don't your brother got them birds ha
You won't bust one of them niggas head ha
You ain't scared ha
You know how to play it ha
I know you ain't just gonna let a nigga come and punk you ha
Stunt and front you ha
Straight up run you ha
You know who got that fire green ha
You know how to use a triple beam ha
Shit ain't hard as it seems ha
You keep your body clean ha
You gotta lot of Girbaud jeans ha
Some of your partners dope fiends ha
You really don't want to fuck with them niggas ha
You come up with them niggas ha
You stuck with them niggas ha

[Chorus]
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is you make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is you make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'

[Verse 2]
You can't do nothin' but love Fresh ha
You want to know what we gonna do next ha
You brought our tape with a check ha
You wearin' a vest ha
You tryin' to protect your chest ha
You spent seventy on your Benz ha
That ain't yours that's for your friends ha
You wanna stop these niggas from playing wit you ha
You wanna run the block ha
You wanna be the only nigga with rocks ha
You keep your gun cocked ha
You count the money at the end of the night ha
You on a three day flight ha
You full of that diesel ha
You duckin' them people ha
Your face was on the news last night ha
You the one that robbed them little dudes out they shoes last night ha
You don't go in the projects when it's dark ha
You claim you a thug and you ain't got no heart ha
You came in the 'Nolia on New Year's Eve ha
You got stuck in that bitch and couldn't leave ha
It was hard for you to breathe ha

[Chorus]
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is you make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is you make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'

[Verse 3]
You got a trespassin' charge ha
That dick got hard ha
When you were lookin' at them little broads ha
You don't know when to quit ha
That's you with that shot callin' shit ha
That's you with that ballin' shit ha
That's you that's takin' them hits ha
That ho don't know when to shut up her mouth ha
You gonna knock that ho teeth out ha
You done switched from Nike to Reebok ha
You twinkle your golds every time you leave your house ha
Them income tax checks out ha
You bout to flip that ha
You bout to go score you a gram ha
You gonna treat your nose ha
You bout to go put the dope dick on one of these ho ha
When you broke you drove ha
When you paid you got beaucoup places to go ha
You on top ha
You rob somebody shop ha
You don't even think you can be stopped ha
You ridin' in the Benz on twenty inch rims ha

[Chorus]
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is you make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is you make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'
