Things you indore when you fuckin wit the boy
All I hear is weezy don’t kill me no more

I got a positive vibe but I ain’t scared of y’all
Git the kid nigga did never that at all

Cuz killas don’t get heard about
They get whispered about
Or you get murdered out (nigga)

Don’t waste no time on no bullshit
If it ain’t hood shit
We spend a lil paper nigga
Well if you catch ’em in the hood nigga
It’s all good shit
Go head do me that favor nigga
Well let me take you down deep in the inside
It’s where they hustle and the homies try to get it right
It’s when you gotta ride
It’s when the homie die
And the money can’t stop the pain in the inside

[Chorus: Birdman (Lil Wayne)]
