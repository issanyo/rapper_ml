Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Fire Flame, Flame, Fire Flame Spitters
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars
Bitch We tha Bizness, Hundred Million Dollars

[Verse 1]
Back on my block, nigga, gun up in my hand
Money off the ocean, nigga landed in the sand
Third wall soldier, world wide general
Cash Money, Young Money fire flame spitters
Hustlin all the time in the middle of the block
The gun stay (Clock-Clock), the money off the top
We do it 'round the clock, bitch we tha bizznes
100 million dolla, filthy 'bout my riches
Stunting on the niggas, 'coz we shine big time
Flip another hundred, nigga, do it on the grind
Bitches on the nigga, 'coz they know we stay fly
Riding 25 on the nigga being high (nigga being high!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Spin a nigga been, nigga, chopper in my hand
Hundred outta land, when you're fucking with the man
5 star nigga, eagles be flying
Just be nigga, bald eagle flying
Uptown soldier, made man on the mission
Did it from the bottom, nose darving(?) for the richest
Been a high roller, flip the Range till Bentley
House full of things, house full of bitches
Switch another lane, nigga flip it all the time
100 on the watch, 20 years on my grind
Blood is my line, uptown general
Cash Money stunnas, Young Money killas
Breeh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mansions in the hills, just a burn a few hunnits
Love the 14's, spend a mil on some furniture(?)
Back on my settle, nigga shuffle from the bottom
Starting with nothing, nice money with this power
Higher than ever, top floor, popping bottles
Minks in the winter, candy with a models
That's how we living, live a luxury life
Never give a fuck, we can do this shit twice
Li-live with the lies, light up for life
Lil nigga getting and doing it for life
Live and got right, so we back up on these businesses
Live to this game, flame up and spitting it
Breeh
