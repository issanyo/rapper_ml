[Intro: Birdman]
Yeah, brrr, Birdman!
Yup, just like that
Always, mo' honey

[Hook: Jay Sean]
Yeah, she got it written on her
Her swag on lean
The way she dancin on me
Can tell that she a queen
Her mama wouldn’t like it, her daddy wouldn’t either
The way she grindin on me - you can tell shawty’s a keeper
She got it written on her, aye aye aye ahh
She got it written on her, aye aye aye ahh
She got it written on her, aye aye aye ahh
She got it written on her, aye aye aye ahh
Yeeeeeaaaaahhhh!

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Gucci bag poppin tags
New crib brand new jag
Birdman born to shine
Bad bitch all the time
Stay fly, ride fly
I’m stuntin’, stay high
Straight G, just like that
Throw 100, bounce right back
Red hot, hard top
Cash money hard knock
Bentley frame, drop top
50 G’s, the bottles pop
Iced out, so we chill
Tool in  every automobile
Tatted up, life of a G
Counting stacks and five star suits

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
250 on the dash
Yeah i’m livin fast
Yeah Im gettin cash
I need a bitch thats bad
Shawty play your role
We slammin phantom doors
She be like drive slow
We burnin purple smoke
I said I’d never fold
I promise not to stop
Just like my rolls royce
The way that girl drop
I need a hot girl
The way the girl hot
Dollar signs tatted on her
On her private flight

[Hook]

[Birdman]
Yeah, just like that
Aight, where you at, Jay?
CMB, 1 hunnid

[Bridge: Jay Sean]
Wanna be all over your body like these Miamian tattoos
Baby I have to, I ain’t playin
And I needa good little freak that's in front of me, baby
You drivin me crazy, ooh-ooh yeahhh
