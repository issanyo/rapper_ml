I am the female Weezy, this shit is easy
Pull up in that new-new, bitch get a squeegee
Yeah my flow sick yeah, yeah my flow queasy
Ha ha they were sleeping on me, z-zz-zz
This pussy clean, this pussy squeaky
That pussy old, that pussy creaky
When I'm out the country, niggas call me Neeki
Hi, how are you? Yes, its nice to meet me
Damn, Billboard, I mean I'm winning, but I'm still bored
Yeah we shine, gold cluster
As, for your career, dead: Ghost Busters

[Chorus]
That's why you mad
Thats why you why you mad mad
That's why you mad
Thats why you why you mad mad
That's why you mad
Thats why you why you mad mad

Yeah, Bigga than life

Man fuck y'all niggas
Get down or lay down
Shoot up anything, except a school or a playground
Triple OG nigga, these hoes know me
Shining AK blood, just like a trophy
I'm a old school nigga and, I'll a smack a bitch
Getting money like a muthafucking cracker bitch
What you know about it, take notes nigga
YMCMB, head coach nigga
Yeah, stuntman, stuntman
Street-sweeper in my hand get the dustpan
Yeah, we done took off nigga
Got the game on lock football nigga

[Chorus]
Uh, I got the world in my wallet
Swisha full of violet
Niggas think they fly make me check ya flight mileage
That P on my hat is for Piru, not Pirates
I bet I can turn her pussy to a fucking fire hydrant
And I do it for my niggas, my muthafucking niggas
Cause these hoes so thirsty, like they got the fucking hiccups
I am beast hoe, to say the least hoe
No cut on the coke, that's coke zero
Yeah tonight, I'll probably fuck another nigga girl
Party time, excellent, Wayne's World
This Cash Money nigga, eat a dick
Been had it on lock, gave the key to Nick'

[Chorus]
