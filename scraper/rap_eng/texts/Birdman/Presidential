[Intro: Jacquees]
Hey

[Chorus: Jacquees]
I stack the money 'til I seen three commas, yeah, ayy
Money bustin' out my jeans
I been runnin' 'round with Stunna, yeah, ayy
We just turned a two to a four, turned a four to a ten, ayy
Ten to a dub, this Cash Money, my friend
I been down since the begin', I told you we'll win, yeah
All my niggas in, we took losses for the win (What?)

[Verse 1: Birdman & Jacquees]
Livin' life so lavish (So lavish, marble)
Presidential baby, Miss Gladys (Miss Gladys)
All about makin' my cabbage (Cabbage)
And we livin' life so savage (Savage)
Pussy nigga wan' play, you know I'm 'round here to ball, nigga
The gold chopper gon' spray
For the money, kill 'em all nigga
Safe house with no case (No case), came true
Got a hundred ways to get face (Get face), get the chips, yeah
Money bags like MoneyMan
Taliban, spent a hundred grand
From the streets, left in the sand
Gettin' money was the only plan (High life, Stunna man, Jacquees)
We sleepin' on a hundred mil' (You know what we doin')
We sleepin' on a cash mule (Rich Gang)

[Chorus: Jacquees]
I stack the money 'til I seen three commas, yeah, ayy
(They told me go and get it
Que you gotta get it, Que you gotta get it, Que you gotta get it)
Money bustin' out my jeans
I been runnin' 'round with Stunna, yeah, ayy
(If you runnin' 'round with Stunna, know you gotta get it, niggas got it, man I gotta get it)
We just turned a two to a four, turned a four to a ten, ayy
Ten to a dub, this Cash Money, my friend
I been down since the begin', I told you we'll win, yeah
All my niggas in, we took losses for the win

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
I know all these bitches 'round me for the come-up
Orange Lamborghini, stuntin' in the summer
I put my partner on the play, bitch fuck your runnin' up
I heard he think this shit a game, but we'll show ya (Bitch we'll show ya)
We don't know ya
Rich Gang, big chain, we 'bout to do it again (Yeah, what)
Rich Gang, big fame, I put my bitch in a Benz
Trouble stay doin' my dance (What?)
She put her hand in my pants, yeah
I'm livin' life, I'm the man
I'm kickin' shit like Japan

[Bridge: Jacquees]
Everybody want a bag (Bag)
Everybody tryna get it (Get it)
Know some niggas hustlin' with they last (Last)
Tryna see they way to millions (Millions)
I gotta get a bigger digit (Digit)
If you start, you gotta finish (Finish)
Baby gave me the keys when I was 19
And told me, "Go and get it"

[Chorus: Jacquees]
I stack the money 'til I seen three commas, yeah, ayy
(They told me go and get it
Que you gotta get it, Que you gotta get it, Que you gotta get it)
Money bustin' out my jeans
I been runnin' 'round with Stunna, yeah, ayy
(If you runnin' 'round with Stunna, know you gotta get it, niggas got it, man I gotta get it)
We just turned a two to a four, turned a four to a ten, ayy
Ten to a dub, this Cash Money, my friend
I been down since the begin', I told you we'll win, yeah
All my niggas in, we took losses for the win
