Good morning everybody it’s DJ Envy, Angela Yee, Charlamagne Tha God. We are ‘The Breakfast Club’. We got a special guest in the building.

(Charlamagne)
He done cursed us out. Tell em, tell em…get it off your chest, Birdman

(Birdman)
I said it already, I ain’t gotta talk no more.

(Charlamagne)
Cause I don’t understand the angle.

(Birdman)
I said it already.

(Charlamagne)
So why come here?

(Birdman)
I did it already. I’m here. So what’s happening?
I wanted to see you. I wanted to talk you as a man to your face. I knew a few places you was at, I could’ve pulled up, but I thought that was gangsta. I wanted to come look you in your face like a man and tell you how I feel.

(Charlamagne)
So what’s the issue?

(Birdman)
Ain’t no issue. If it was an issue, you would feel me. I just came to let y’all know, put some respect on my name. When y’all say my name, put some respect on it.

(Charlamagne)
Did you pull up on Ross that way? Or Trick Daddy?

(Birdman)
Man, I’m pullin’ up on you, nigga.

(Charlamagne)
But I’m the radio guy. Why pull up on the radio guy? Don’t act tough with the radio guy?

(Birdman)
I hear you, my nigga. Y’all finished or y’all done? I ain’t got no more talkin’. Let’s rock. See you later nigga

(Charlamagne)
Well, grand opening, grand closing.
