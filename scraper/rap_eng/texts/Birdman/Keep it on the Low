Up in the club
Sippin on mo
Got my hands up
Chokin on dro
All of my thugs
Freakin on the floor
Get the hottest chicks
And put them in a row
Take them to the hotel
Party some mo
Shorty frontin like she dont know whats goin on
Why you up in here if ya set on sayin no
If ya got a man we can keep it on the low

You really don't wanna say no girl (do you)
You really wanna get with TQ girl (don't you)
You really wanna leave this club
Get to the tele and give the nigga some love
You really wanna touch the ice
I can tell by the way your eyes scopin the ice (at me)
You really want the thuggin type
You don't really want them suit and tie cats in your life
You wanna freak on the floor bottle of mo
Some bomb ass dro when you're ready to go
You wanna wile at the club but your girls like whoa
When it's time to ride out you gon ride for sho
You a ghetto ass shorty and I like that in ya
And it ain't the belvy talking it's the thuggin in ya
I'm like a horny gilligan and you're looking like ginger
Now come and let me put terrance junior in ya

See I pulled out a knot
She smelled the money
We just blew one so she smelled us coming
We drank till we pop the benz is runnin
The lexus, the jag and the h-3's on
Stunnas!

[TQ]
You got a love the way I ride
Pull all the fly women out the line
Mammie let's go we need to spend some time
Come sit on my lap, lay back and recline

[Baby]
Hit the club, to burn a few hundreds
V.i.p. we drank a little something
A cutie with a booty say she knew (she knew me?)
From my projects and the baller blockin movie!

[TQ]
Up in the club is what i'm speakin of
Where the ladies and the thugs all give me love
And everybody happy cause they got a buzz
Till the niggas start trippin and blow the place up
Say what
