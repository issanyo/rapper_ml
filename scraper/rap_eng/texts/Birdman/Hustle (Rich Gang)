[Hook: Birdman]
Give the world to my lil niggas
Show the world my lil niggas
I came up with my lil niggas
And I showed nothing but them young niggas that money
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Just hustle, just hustle off the muscle
Give the world to my lil niggas
Show the world my lil niggas
Put in work with my lil niggas
Seeing nothing but them young niggas with money
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Just hustle, just hustle off the muscle

[Verse 1]
Lil nigga, big money, big
Fuck with you can't hear no feelings
Before I met Bird, I had millions
Fuck a rocker deal, my niggas still out here drug dealing
Fuck these rap niggas, we gon' take these niggas' lunch
These niggas asking for it but this ain't what you want
None of them haters imagine me here, all of 'em mad cause I'm the man of the year
I don't give no fuck about it, take up the hatred up out of my ill
Get it up out of my mind, I can't have a good time when you here
All of my niggas is dying, I wish that I could rewind
I sent 'em back to that Ghost, all of these bitches been asking for more
All of my niggas I'm gold, [?] I'm telling you man I feel you the most

[Hook: Birdman]
Give the world to my lil niggas
Show the world my lil niggas
I came up with my lil niggas
And I showed nothing but them young niggas that money
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Just hustle, just hustle off the muscle
Give the world to my lil niggas
Show the world my lil niggas
Put in work with my lil niggas
Seeing nothing but them young niggas with money
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Just hustle, just hustle off the muscle

[Verse 2]
Look, what's happening with you? Bitch I been eating
Thinking that she sweet boy, [?]
I jeopardising me just so my fam can have it easy
I think before I do so all my actions have a reason
Trapping for something extra
Ratchets on my dresser
