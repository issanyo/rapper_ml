Yeah
Lookin out the window of a heli-chopta over city lights
Makin' it rain, makin' it snow
Sunshine..

[Chorus]
Been about cash
Been a, been about cash
Been a, been about money
Been about money
Been about cash
Been a-, been about cash
Been a-, been about big money
B- big money

[Verse 1]
Hundred on the stack
Rubbers on the band
Van full of kush
Guns in the lamb
Dumpin' moving fast
More money than I seen
Louie was the tag, the duffel bag and the jean
Bald eagle shit
Fly born rich
Filthy with the grind, come from flippin' bricks
Customize shit, foreign fly red bitch
The leather stay soft
The head line stitched
Blowin' out the bound another show some mo money
Flip another hundred see we do this every summer
Brand new harley
Keep some extra clips
Keep some extra diamonds
Keep some new whips
100

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Bottom of the shit
Everyday the same story; bull shit ain't shit so everyday the same story
More money is the shit
Everyday the same story
Headline cash money sign (I'm filthy rich bitch!) you know
Money is a must
We did the high life
Fully loaded 'round this bitch just the cash money life
In broad day light see we do it when we see it
You can put that on my hood: YM/CMB
Livin' legend livin' good
Marble on the wood
Spendin' how you feel nigga nothin' when your good
The game on the wood
Them hoes out the hood
Poppin' (?) and we ridin' cherrywood

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Master of my piece
Got the time on my watch
Cartier is the piece got the grind on my watch
Got my mind on my money so we stay up on my grizzy everytime I'm gettin' these hundreds got my youngin' comin' with me
We push truck, phantom top, everyday, non-stop benz coupe hard top bugatti nigga hard knock
Heli-chopta's choppas
We do it on the sunshine
Boats and them choppa's
We cruisin' on them high ti's
Highway money
Interstate hustlin'
Back to my city
Great take the birds hummin' (?)
Hundred dollar nigga
Hundred thousand cash
Make another million
Stashed in the dash
100

[Chorus]

Lookin' at the city lights
Just like that
250 in my pocket
Another mil in my bag
Yeah
100
Fuck with'em
