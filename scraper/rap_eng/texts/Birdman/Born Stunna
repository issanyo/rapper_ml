[Intro: Ross]
Born stunna
I’m a born stunna
Huh born stunna

[Bridge: Ross]
Money money money money money bags
Money money money bags
Money money money bags
Money money money bags

[Hook: Ross]
Born stunna, born stunna
Flip a hundred keys just to ball all summer
Born stunna, born stunna
I put a hundred karats in the cartier mama
Born stunna, she’s a born stunna
Mercedes coupe for the missus if she’s a born stunna
Born stunna, born stunna
Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin’

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Born stuntin’, rep huntin’
Flock a hundred of them things for them cheap numbers
Ran numbers, head huntin’
Hit the mall with my bitch and blow another hunnit
Red flaggin’, poppin’ red bottles
I’m talkin’ big faces, money and the power
Suede linin’, with my name in it
Birdman, bitch and I’ve been gettin' it
Yea, so my baby want a new whip
Pearl white, stay fresh on that new shit
You dig? born hustlin’ on that money shit
Ya feel? blowin’ mills, big jewels bitch

[Hook] + [Bridge]
Born stunna, born stunna
Flip a hundred keys just to ball all summer
Born stunna, born stunna
I put a hundred karats in the cartier mama
Born stunna, she's born stunna
Mercedes coupe for the missus if she’s a born stunna
Born stunna, born stunna
Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin’
Money money money money money bags
Money money money bags
Money money money bags
Money money money bags

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yea, a lot a lot of money bags
The money in the garbage can
Strapped up tight with a hundred bags
Money filthy bitch, we in the money lair
See, we shinin’ like the money can
Since the money came, bitch we doing the money dance
Yea, Y-M-C-M-G
Lauder jet, been a hustler since I hit the streets
Took 250 on the new piece
New condo, 20,000 square feet
Ballin’, uptown suicide
Born stuntin’, strapped how we livin’ five

[Hook] + [Bridge]
Born stunna, born stunna
Flip a hundred keys just to ball all summer
Born stunna, born stunna
I put a hundred karats in the cartier mama
Born stunna, she's born stunna
Mercedes coupe for the missus if she’s a born stunna
Born stunna, born stunna
Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin’
Money money money money money bags
Money money money bags
Money money money bags
Money money money bags

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Cash money, hundred stacks
Been grindin’ since the 90's with that chrome mac
Fifty whip sittin’ right in front of that
Ocean view, top floor, blew a hundred racks
G5’in with them chandeliers
Checker floors, tattoo tears
Uptown nigga on the battle field
Maybach relaxin’ on them cop heels
Candy coated, a Harley Davis
Stuntin’ on them niggas like the old Baby
Bad bitch, matchin’ Gucci bikes
My son lit, we live a high life

[Hook] + [Bridge]
Born stunna, born stunna
Flip a hundred keys just to ball all summer
Born stunna, born stunna
I put a hundred karats in the cartier mama
Born stunna, she's born stunna
Mercedes coupe for the missus if she’s a born stunna
Born stunna, born stunna
Stack a hundred mill and another hundred comin’
Money money money money money bags
Money money money bags
Money money money bags
Money money money bags
