[Verse 1]
When we turn on our TV
It hits us with heartache
And the cycle we can see
Is more bias, more hate
What legacy will we leave
For the ones that come after?
All I see in front of me
Unnatural disaster

[Pre-Chorus]
But then I see one, it only takes one smile
One smile to break through
And then I see one, it only takes one hand
To reach out and help you

[Chorus]
No bullet, no gun
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love
Nobody, no one
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Can you feel it, the love?

[Verse 2]
We get taught the colour of our skin
Is what we're defined by
There's too many kids suffering
And for the bottom dollar they die

[Chorus]
No bullet, no gun
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love
Nobody, no one
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love

[Post-Chorus 2]
Do you feel it? Do you feel it?
Do you feel it? Do you feel it, the love?

[Bridge: Snob Scrilla:]
Said, Mr. Officer, Officer, what's the quota for promise, sir?
Supposed to be serving the people but you're serving the dollar, sir
Undocumented killers, they knocking down the buildings
See, I ain't no O.D.B., meaning they're not for the children
KKK, what's really going on? Ask yourself when you hear this song
Are we living in a nation that's promoting segregation?
Before you see my colour, you should see me as your brother
A strong black man with a proud white mother

[Pre-Chorus]
But then I see one, it only takes one smile
One smile to break through
And then I see one, it only takes one hand
To reach out and help you

[Chorus]
No bullet, no gun
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love
Nobody, no one
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love

No bullet, no gun
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love
Nobody, no one
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love

No bullet, no gun
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love
Nobody, no one
Can't stop the love, can't stop the love
