Chorus

I'm gettin' amp a nigga gettin' straight amp
I got my four ten and nigga I'm on the ramp
I'm gettin' amp a nigga gettin' straight amp
I got my four ten and nigga I'm on the ramp

{Tec-9}

Twenty three eighteen errata the bullets scatter
Rat a Tat Tatter another nigga lay on his back
Its goin' down on the ramp tonight
An when the lights go out
All the robbers and killers come out
The horn blowin' for all them schemin' ass niggas
Niggas be lookin' to come up don't even run up
I'm gettin' amp and chillin' wit Vamp
Lil' Creature and Tyron be quick to slang dat iron
Where dey at go get 'em forget 'em
Do away wit 'em nigga kill 'em!
And my nigga from calio
Its all about that drama bro
They be down to fuck a ho
And I'm tellin' my brother in a wheelchair
Nigga I was always there
Smokin' bubbles and gettin' high!
Lil' Edward bring the a-k
Because today I had to spray me a nigga
Straight down a nigga
Comin' in the projects wit an blue rag round his neck
Thus mutherfucker was trippin' gee
An I profected the one two which mean
Cock my gun and aim it at you
Now what you gonna do!
Now ya got to take to the chest
And do yo Best!
Then let the niggas know the niggas from the three ain't hoes!
We bout the paper and capers strictly from the street
Turn ya off like a lamp comin' straight from the ramp!
Only paper and capers strictly from the 3rd ward
Livin' in that u.p.t. ya got to live hard

Chorus

I'm gettin' amp a nigga gettin' straight amp
I got my four ten and nigga I'm on the ramp

{Baby}
Just got an mouth full nigga from first to z
I got a beep look like an whole key
My nigga D.C. came back to town
Word around? he brought the dope back to town!
So I hit my fuckin' safe for thirty gees
Scope my issue breakin' down a quarter bees
I'm gonna holla at Tec on the ramp
Chillin' wit the other niggas black vamp
Go to Martin Luther King wet that girl
They bout that furl nigga they in the world

{Tec-9}
Nigga got to stay high to live in this world
I'm lookin' for this nigga worth five gees
When I catch him I'm a kill him
Because deem gees gonna put me on my feet
Call up my nigga ps o five hooked me up wit twenty-five
That nigga hooked me up tight
Runnin' shop to baronne and calio
Got to have that paper even if I got to pull that fuckin' caper
Ain't no need for the ho shit because niggas be down
When I'm the one supplyin' the white shit
Now I'm a stack them bills up I got a better hustle
Hooked up wit big Rufus
He taught me how to cut it down
I'm fuckin' wit brown watch out for that monkey
My shop is on sixth and Willard
That's where you find that killer gorilla
Ya bitch you!
That mutherfuckin' furl is draggin' the world
Nigga sayin' fuck that and bust back
An Fuck an C-O-P man!
Nigga try'na kidnap Tec-9
All the time it won't happen because I got that iron
It ain't a nine that shoot fast but its an gun that will
Put ya on yo stankin' ass
Keep it hard ain't no thing to throw deem knuckles
If I catch the first lick
Watch yo knees buckle
Call it champ a nigga was slangin' deem thangs
While I'm chillin' on a ramp
An its cool because a nigga be actin' a fool
Gettin' full of that water
Peep the body as I slaughter
All these niggas walkin' up to me
Servin' and smokin' got me slippin' gee
Now my back is kind of low I can't be broke no more
So I just get the ski mask for that ass
Better watch out nigga because I'm comin'
You know when I'm commin'
Because Ya Hear The bullets hummin'

I'm gettin' amp a nigga gettin' straight amp
I got my four ten and fool I'm on the ramp

I'm gettin' amp a nigga gettin' straight amp
I got my four ten I'm killin' niggas on the ramp

I'm gettin' amp a nigga gettin' straight amp
I got my four ten and bitch I'm on the ramp

I'm gettin' amp a nigga gettin' straight amp
Tec-9 and I'm chillin' on the ramp
