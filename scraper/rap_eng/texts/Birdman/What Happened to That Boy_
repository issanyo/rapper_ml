[Intro: Birdman]
Aye, aye, aye, ya
Tote 'em up, light it up nigga
Birdman, motherfucker
Clipse, VA, NO nigga, what you smelt
Coca leaf plastic
Get off the border, motherfucker
Come on little'n handle your business for me, boy

[Hook: Pusha T & (Birdman)]
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy

[Verse 1: Malice]
I heard they snitching on a player, man, say it ain't so
Even as a young'un they consigned me to blow
Which explains why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an 8th to an O
Word in the streets that the envy is me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly
9 on the waist, hit the bitch up severely
I'm known for the flip of that coca√≠na
I'm heavy in the street like the 7 series Beema' man
Hit 'em with the Nina, man
Or that 4/5th guaranteed to lean ya man, whoa
I'm the reason that your block is vacant
Malicious will hit you just to make a statement
Bitch! Clipse and Cash Money, who ain't rich?
Don't compare me to you, nigga, you ain't this, whoa

[Hook: Pusha T & (Birdman)]
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Stunna and Patty Cake, the worldwide Pusha
Birdman, nigga, leave the guns in the bushes
Been shitting up bricks, unload 'em to Gussy
Boss of the ghetto with the round-shape cookie
Shit one, throw one, nigga, flood the block
If I don't go to jail, nigga, birds gon' flock
Nigga sitting on the toilet, bitch, get off the pot!
The bird just landed so the hood gonna rock
New whips, big chips, the Prada/Gucci shit
Bought mami a fly Benz, the wide skinny lips
She takes my flight, she holds my weight
While the po-po staked out from state to state
It ain't nothing to a baller, baby, pay the cost
Big money, heavy weight, Birdman, hood boss, baby
Stepping on my line, I'll show a little something
Make Corleone come out and the black crow'll touch ya

[Hook: Pusha T & (Birdman)]
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Yuugh! Another soul lost
Had to make his shirt match my oxblood-colored Porsche
Yuugh, the rims match, of course
Blood hit his Timbs, it reminded me of them
Glistening, wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm, a gorgeous killa
I put this on my Lord
My niece was four when she felt chinchilla
I passed the chauffeur that shit
That made fiends rise from the dead like "Thriller"
Gangster, hustler
At night, still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreaming, kick my feet up
Gun poked my waist, remind me of my demon
So quit your yappin' before I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix and matchin', fella

[Hook: Pusha T & (Birdman)]
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit, we put a clap into that boy
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
(Brrrrrrrrrrr!) What happened to that boy?
He was talking shit we put a clap into that boy

[Outro: Birdman]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, there it is nigga, there you have it
Birdman, Clipse you under-smelt, VA, you know?
Uptown nigga, we go anywhere with this bullshit
We flip bricks you under-smell (gangster motherfucker)
Aye nigga put this puzzle together
Aye Pharrell, you did this year (you did it nigga)
1000 pieces, puzzles, (startrak) 100, you know
Let's get this money (get the money)
Hey nigga, I smell somethin', coca leaf plastic, bitch
Get money, motherfucker (biatch!)
However you want it, you can get it, pimp
From gangsta to blood, nigga, take it how you want it, nigga
We did it how we live, ain't nothin' but the thug thing, nigga
Money thing, motherfucker
