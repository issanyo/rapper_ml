[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
Rich Gang
We we, tryna get rich as fast as we can
We, we, yeah, stack it up as tall as we can
Super Iz, DRoc-DRoc-DRoc

[Chorus: Jacquees]
(Your girl's with me), you fucking with the boss
I don't care 'bout what it cost (And she ain't tryna leave)
I'll fuck you like you want (She got a thing for me)
Girl tell me what you want (She know I keep it G)
The way I roll it ain't regular (No way)
My car ain't regular, I got no time for regular things
We can set it off in the Bentley, holler if you hear me
No other nigga kick it the same (No disrespect)

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
But when I talk, girl, you should listen
Givin' you game, pulled you out of the competition
Put you on planes, gave you somethin' to say
These bitches follow your page just to check out your day, ayy
You ain't a lame, bae, stay away from lames, ayy
I'm giving you game, bae, soak up all this game
They don't like to see when you shinin', it's so obvious
Nobody wanna fuck up when everybody's watchin'

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
We we, tryna get rich as fast as we can
We we, we, yeah
Stack it up as tall as we can

[Chorus: Jacquees]
(Your girl's with me), you fucking with the boss
I don't care 'bout what it cost (And she ain't tryna leave)
I'll fuck you like you want (She got a thing for me)
Girl tell me what you want (She know I keep it G)
The way I roll it ain't regular (No way)
My car ain't regular, I got no time for regular things
We can set it off in the Bentley, holler if you hear me
No other nigga kick it the same

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Two-fifty on the new place (New place)
Got a hundred on the front plate (Front plate)
We jugg back on that cake (That cake)
Pull it down around my waist ('Round my waist)
We lace it up and stay fly (Stay fly)
Empty clip down on his face (His face)
We'll shoot it down with no case (No case)
She took it back to my place (My place)
The G5 on my way, and she landed on my lakes
So we did it all in one day
Gave her diamond with the new plate
So she love the life that we livin' (We livin')
Pay the dice and we flippin' (We flippin')
Ocean view is my vision (My vision)
We paid the price and we feel it (Brrat)

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
We we, tryna get rich as fast as we can
We we, we, yeah
Stack it up as tall as we can

[Chorus: Jacquees]
(Your girl's with me), you fucking with the boss
I don't care 'bout what it cost (And she ain't tryna leave)
I'll fuck you like you want (She got a thing for me)
Girl tell me what you want (She know I keep it G)
The way I roll it ain't regular (No way)
My car ain't regular, I got no time for regular things
We can set it off in the Bentley, holler if you hear me
No other nigga kick it the same
