[Intro: Birdman]
Ya, this is the RedOne
YMCMB flashing lifestyle, yo!
Sitting on this top floor
Flyer than ever, landed on the rooftop
Let's get it!

[Hook: KMC]
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Everybody put your hands in the air!
[Mohombi:] (Do you feel like movin', movin', movin'?)
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Do you feel like movin', movin'

Everybody put your hands in the air!
[Mohombi:] (Do you feel like movin', movin', movin'?)

[Verse 1: Mohombi]
Let me spend it all on you like it's my payday, girl
Have you sip the finest 'cause you're thirsty girl
[KMC:] (Let's hit the club, let's hit the club
Let's hit the floor, let's hit the floor)
So, I can make it look like it's your birthday, girl
Keep it up, don't keep it on the low
Bam-ti-bam the party on the floor
All my people over there, come!
There's a party over here, say

(Daddy keep the party)

[Hook: KMC]

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Bang! One time for world peace
And getting in between your girl's teeth
I'm one of them tell-the-truth rappers the world needs
But I'm not like them, too nice, your girl's cheatin'
That's not alright, I'm in a drop, all white
Tryna blow my head up, we just pop all night
Till the cop car lights try and stop us
Then we put the gas to the flo', wonder what they think about us
I'ma, uh, we hit the night show
Popped off, relive the light show
My ex-girlfriend tried to call me psycho
I told her, "It's just something 'bout white folk"
All we know is, damn, this life show
Gone, come and go, like the colors on Michael
So give me two shots, put some 2Pac on the playlist
And dare a motherfucker try to hoop this, Caskey

[Hook: KMC]
Do you feel like movin', movin'

Do you feel like movin', movin'
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Everybody put your hands in the air!
[Mohombi:] (Do you feel like movin', movin', movin'?)
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Do you feel like movin', movin'
Everybody put your hands in the air!
