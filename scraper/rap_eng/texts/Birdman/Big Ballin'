I told ya fuckin' ass I be back
In a brand new Fleetwood Cadillac
License plate say money makin' nigga fa sho
Chillin' by ya boy house kissin' on these hoes
See these broads want stars
Big dicks down in the drows
Seven days a week seven brand new cars
Yeah I done it parkin' GS 300
Check us and front it the Navigator
Garage with the elevator, you not a hata
Then press second floor
So you can see the muthfuckin' Big Tymers car show
Now on the left side we got the brand new Benz
And on the right side bitches shakin' ass for ends
And in the middle niggas throwin' 20s and 10s
And up top niggas drinkin' juices with gin juices with gin juices with gin

[Baby]
News cars pretty broads, neighborhood superstars
Going far, goin' to the super bowl
In the hole and I owe my nigga for frontin' me two kilos
Yellow ice with new heights, hoes got my name right
Fame got my muthafuckin' game tight
Dirt digga, ho go-getta, nigga outta line
Playboy I got ten on ya feet
Car shina, rim blinda, 20 inch rida
Nigga and you can ride right beside me
Titty watcha, ho stoppa, VCR tape poppa
Neighborhood naked flick watcha
Border line Hen (hennesey) poppa
Byran is my heart and Pearl is my number one chick
And Ca$h Money Records gone run this nationwide shit
And playa you can believe that shit

[Chorus]

[Manny Fresh]
Twenty inch wheels is what I roll
And when I pass yo bitch all outta control

[Baby]

Ridin' with cha bitch with the tymers playin'

[Baby]
Ballin everyday popin' Dom P bottles
Ball til ya fall is the Ca$h Money motto
Flashy cars, pretty broads
The word uptown we bought these cars
For girls I bought pretty jewels with new shoes
With tatoos, a Ca$h Money motto do what you gotta do

[Manny Fresh]
Fight who you gotta fight, shoot who you gotta shoot
Boot who you gotta boot, do what you gotta do

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa whoa Kemosabe
Big big big ballin' is my hobby
Whoa whoa whoa Kemosabe

[Manny Fresh]
Ten years ago a friend of mine
Brought me to uptown second line
Met meatball, nair, anglin mets
Want you do a D.J. in the jets
Bought two Triggermans and Brown beats
Now you can pop that pussy in the middle of the street
Best believe next week I'mma be downtown
Point court St. Bernard bitch throwin' down
Then I'm mosy on down cross the kanel
Put up the mic cuz I got a fuckin' story ta tell
