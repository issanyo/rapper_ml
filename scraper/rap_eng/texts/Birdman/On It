[Intro: Jacquees]
Ladies and Gentleman, it's the young player, the young OG
Cash money, Rich Gang, FYB
Right here with my uncle Stunna, High Life
And I am Jacquees

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Never seen a bitch cause if I'm in it, I own it
If she living in my city, best believe we been on it
Make her pull up, roll up, power, take a shot of this liquor
We drinking GTV, boy, we been on this level
Got killers, we so deep, but I lay mines down
Little [?] we 'bout that action, put it down for my town
My little nephew straight thugging, hustling, holding the block
And Cash Money still an army, taking trips, shipping blocks

[Hook 1: Jacquees]
You know we on it
In the club, best believe we roll deep
Them boys don't want it
And know your baby momma roll my weed?

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
Don't be too star struck to say what's up
We in that new Maybach when we pull up
You can watch TV and put your feet up
She gon' roll my weed and throw my hood up
I'm counting bank rolls, don't fuck the same hoes
Don't wear the same clothes, stay in your lane though
Girl you picture perfect, and oh, I think you're worth it
Think you're worth it
Girl, come to my side and I'mma show you how we ride

I'm J-A-C-Q-U-E-E-S, Jacquees, I love sex
I [?] on you, V-necks, shawty thinks she knows me
Nah baby, that's the old Quees
Pull up and don't talk about it
Give you something so you could talk about it, talk about it
What

[Hook 2: Jacquees (Birdman)]
You know we on it
In the club, best believe we roll deep
Them boys don't want it
And know your baby momma roll my weed?
Don't you try to run around on me
All my niggas I'mma show you how it be
(Chandelier lights)
Girl we on it, girl we on it, best believe
(Alexander McQueen floors)
Oh boy we on it, yeah we on it, best believe
(Versace robes nigga)

[Verse 3: Birdman]
She wanna ride in that Bugatti
She wanna ride in that Maybach
Stunna bet mills on anybody that waited
I ain't got the hottest clique
I ain't fuck the hottest bitches
I ain't got the flyest whips
I ain't flipped a lot of bricks
So uptown, so uptown
When I come through it's straight up town
When I land nigga I touchdown
When I come around I put it down
Say a prayer  nigga for the player nigga
Tryna play a nigga, gotta pay up nigga
Still got the Bible next to my gun
Stunna man still bust for his son, brap

[Hook 3: Jacquees]
You know we on it
In the club, best believe we roll deep
Them boys don't want it
And know your baby momma roll my weed?
Don't you try to run around on me
All my niggas I'mma show you how it be
Girl we on it, girl we on it, best believe
Oh boy we on it, yeah we on it, best believe
You know we on it
In the club, best believe we roll deep
Them boys don't want it
And know your baby momma roll my weed?
Don't you try to run around on me
All my niggas I'mma show you how it be
Girl we on it, girl we on it, best believe
Oh boy we on it, yeah we on it, best believe
