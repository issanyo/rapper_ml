[Hook: Jacquees]
Me and Stunna living lavish
It's up to me I gotta have it
Cash money soldier bout that action
Ima knock'em off they balance
We been smokin all this weed
Fuckin women on the beach
I been livin in the palace
Aye me and Stunna living lavish
Aye I got bitches out in Dallas
Shakin booty, strippin for the money
Hit the stage and get the money
Ima king, I'm fresh up out the dungeon
Bugatti in the drive way, Hey fuck a hater I am paid
Me and Stunna living lavish and we got bitches out in Dallas

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Hey I been kickin like a king, Hey I been living out a dream (my dreams)
I pull up in a limousine, fresh up on a magazine
Florida water unclean, spot a hater with the beam
Aye birdman know that shit so cool
Me and Stunna hit the road, Aye me and Stunna gotta go
Aye we gotta get on the road, I gotta get on the road
Aye I'm having somewhere to go
Aye Stunna gone and let them know that I got you
Young nigga full of flame like a dragon, no braggin
But..

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Flew up out went to Cali, Old school wearin Bally's
Cartier with the shades, Never could live average
Dallas living like Mavericks, Wall safe full of cabbage
Pussy nigga know me, I'm all about my fees
All about my g, Knowing how we gone eat
Moving up with them birds, Cali kush and that word
Cali cooking that bird, Cali moving that herb
Uptown my words, Spent a Bentley get served blattt

Jacquees don't just rap, he can sang (Jacquees sang yeah, yeah)
I'm in the 6 with my woes, on the chap finna hit candler road
We don't buy shoes out the store

And Birdman got my back like coats
Cash money youngin, they don't fit the roll
