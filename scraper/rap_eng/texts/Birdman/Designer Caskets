[Chorus - Mannie Fresh]
I send 'em back in the Designer Casket (ya, ya, ya)
Wrapped in plastic
I send 'em back in the Designer Casket (ya)
Wrapped in plastic (ya)
Drag him from the river dump his body in the yard (Amen)
Note around his neck saying get right with the Lord (Amen)
Note around his neck saying get right with the Lord (Amen)
Get right with the Lord, get right with the Lord

[Verse 1 - Mannie Fresh]
Hundred, thousand, in a briefcase
Orange Lamborghini [?] with the dealer plates
Told these, hoes, I'll be right back
Another hundred thousand spilling out the backpack
I, do the, whole, dash
Sideways on these bitches bout to act an ass
Bricks, pounds, pills, weed
Went to Hiroshima came back speaking Japanese
Sushi, uchi, nigga dressed in Gucci
Xany pills got me feeling like I'm super [?]
Send him, back, to his, momma
A hundred bullet holes, first 48 dropped him
This that real project shit that these niggas wanna hear from me
Real trill bitch do a pull-down, hit a lick for me
Clearing out your block fuck yall 9mm
[?] shit that make these shooters go and kill for me

[Chorus]
Designer Casket (ya, ya, ya)
Wrapped in plastic
I send 'em back in the Designer Casket (ya)
Wrapped in plastic (ya)
Drag him from the river dump his body in the yard (Amen)
Note around his neck saying get right with the Lord (Fresh) (Amen)
Note around his neck saying get right with the Lord (Amen)
Get right with the Lord, get right with the Lord

[Verse 2 - Birdman]
I, fucked, these, hoes
Af-ter, our, shows
Big, dicks, we slang
Rich, gang wartime, let's bang
I told them pussy niggas I was coming right back
Slap, back, cash, back
Long, sticks, automatic straps
Hundred G's get a hundred hoes in your lap
Lamborghini with the red blood on the floors
Suicide, suicide want some mo
Cash, money, big, mansion
Nigga, hate, holla smack em
Third ward told me fame came with the drama
Top floor seat so I put it on my mama
Rest, in, peace to my daddy
Seven three billion streams nigga had to have it

[Chorus]
Wrapped in plastic
I send 'em back in the Designer Casket (ya)
Wrapped in plastic (ya)
Drag him from the river dump his body in the yard (Amen)
Note around his neck saying get right with the Lord ( Amen)
Note around his neck saying get right with the Lord (Amen)
Get right with the Lord, get right with the Lord

[Outro]
Before they could see it, we saw it (ye, ye)
Now they know a nigga be with it
Trippin back on the designer
Simple, fame came with the gang
Bizzy what's brackin'
[?] town what's happenin'
MF, yea shawty, with all that
[?] Lying around the corner
On the road with, Rich gang a long bang boy
