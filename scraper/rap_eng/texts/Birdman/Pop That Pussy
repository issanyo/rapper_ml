Pop that, pop that, pop that, pop that
Pop that pussy and shake that ass (It's money everywhere)
Pop that pussy and shake that ass (It's money everywhere)
Pop that pussy and shake that ass (It's money everywhere)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Grab that big bitch if you a thick bitch
She fuck with three niggas, she a slick bitch
She got two phones, want a new home
She got the best hair, they got the boy gone
But I'm so trill, didn't pay her rent
I paid the light bill, did it like a pimp
Call me Double R, I got the Rolls Royce
This is Ricky Ross, still a ho's choice

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah, Birdman, bitch, you know I'm with G
Mr. money tree, mama, you know I'm a beast
Eagle in these streets, you know I'm a eat
Stay fresh, so fly nigga, roll with new feats'
My baby is a gangsta, got hips and she fine
Tattoo her mind, do it all the time
Fuck her from the back cause she like the sunshine
Get mine, take mine, cook it how I like mine

[Hook]
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and pop that pussy
And pop that pussy and shake that ass

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm so easy, I'm so cheesy
These hoes slime me, I'm so greasy
I don't love y'all, time to get home
I get naked and count money, I'm so raw
The Glock black, the rims chrome
The fierce man, I've been strong
This bitch bad, her legs long
This bitch bad, let's see her at home

[Verse 4: Birdman]
See, I fuck them in my helicopter
With my new chopper
Knew the bitch want it so I wouldn't even stop her
Pulled off in that brand new Range
Let the ho give me brains, counting money, moving things
Back in my old school with my old jewels
The ho got hot, broke me off, had to move
G4 flying, you know I got slim, baby fat, baby know how I like them

[Hook]
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and pop that pussy
And pop that pussy and shake that ass

[Verse 5: Rick Ross]
You see 'em be, the money cash
Don't take checks, only money bags
We dope boys, the money fast
She love toys, she coming fast
She got the titty job, the ass shots
She get your money and she mash up
I'm in the stash house where the cash at
You broke niggas

[Verse 6: Birdman]
See, I'm an uptown gangsta, got the game from some gangsters
Got the game cause I'm thinking that we hitting and we banking
Bitch banking, rinse 'em while they sinking
Took the nigga bitch, now we roll his red mannequin
The big funds, nigga with them big guns
She like real niggas, nigga, so she got one
You know what I'm saying? Bitch, come and get some
Five star condo, ocean view, own one

[Hook]
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and pop that pussy
And pop that pussy and shake that ass
