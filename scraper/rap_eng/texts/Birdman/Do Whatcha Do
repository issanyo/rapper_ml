When I shine - I gatta shine right
My Roley ain't gon' winde at all if it don't winde right
When I hit the second line I gatta fuck it up
T.V.s - loud sound and dubs is a must
Y'kno Lil' Geezy gatta stunt - it's in my nature
If you ball - then do what 'chu do, I ain't gon' hate ya
But disrespect a hot boy - I'll spray ya
We pay police so on top they gon' close case ya
Look my whole fam' - roll top of the line - off top
Fresh got the 'Vette, Baby got the 470 Lex
Juve got the new (2000) Yukon - Wayne got a coupe
I got a Benz truck look like a lil' polo boo
We got every car they made from a Ford ta Benz
Fucked everything in the city from relatives ta friends
We some Uptown hard hittin' - shined out ballers
Head bustin' - bitch smackin' - real shot callers

(Hook 2x - [B.G.])

Bitche's say I stunt too much, hoe let me do what I do
Let me get my shine on - let me floss with my crew
Let me play it how it go - drink Vodka and Mo'
