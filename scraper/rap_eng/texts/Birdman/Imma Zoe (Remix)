[Intro: Black Dada and  Rick Ross]
Yeah (It's Ricky Ross)
It's your boy Black (Black Dada)
AKA (Sak pase)
(Yeah) Got another one!
(Strictly business)
Said I'm tatted on my chest
(Like I said, strictly business baby)
(Yeah, Boss)

[Chorus: Black Dada]
Tatted on my chest, yes I'm a Zoe
I never had a problem getting dough
Making this music's all I know
So hold on tight cause Imma blow
In donk's Chevy, we ride
At the club, we live
On 6"s and 7"s, we ride
At any show, we live

[Verse 1: Black Dada]
Said tatted on my chest, yes I'm a Zoe
When haters talk mess I lose control
Using my fist, that's all I know
With my own two feet go blow for blow
What you gotta problem, now you know I'm live
Never had a problem to go inside
Fucking with me is suicide
Step into the jungle, well you won't survive
Perment wet on the Chevy paint
Turnin' your face, dog my shit will stink
Hypotize rims make you go insane
Just like a bobblehead, bobbling brain
Riding swerve from lane to lane
I'ma let the whole world know my name
On my shit cause I'm a pro
Tatted on my chest cause I'm a Zoe

[Chorus: Black Dada and Rick Ross]
Tatted on my chest, yes I'm a Zoe
I never had a problem getting dough(dough)
Making this music's all I know
So hold on tight cause Imma blow
(Juancito, I love you my brother)
In donk's Chevy, we ride
At the club, we live
(Redd Eyezz)
On 6"s and 7"s, we ride
(I see y'all)
At any show, we live

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Tatted on my chest yes, I'm 'bout dope
If you got a stick, lick a shot for the Zoes
'Cause we ain't got shit, but we got pride
If I get tried, boy we all gotta ride
Nigga fuck fame, gotta do it for the land
Got a couple milli, but I do it for the fam
Eating like a don, [???]
Mega "Zoe" on the blimp, when he post that bond
Maybe it's a dream, maybe it's the green
Seeing Black Dada, number one on the screen
Ladies get chills, and boys gettin' mills
Reppin' for the Zoes, strictly it is what it is
If you a Zoe, throw it in the sky
Like top 6 boy I got my fire
When it comes to gettin' money, I'm a pro
Number one album six weeks, went gold

[Chorus: Black Dada and Birdman]
Tatted on my chest, yes I'm a Zoe
I never had a problem getting dough
Making this music's all I know
So hold on tight cause Imma blow
In donk's Chevy, we ride
At the club, we live
(Yeah, YMCMB)
On 6"s and 7"s, we ride
(Three Oh Five, Oh Four)
At any show, we live
(Baby, it's strictly business)

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Pearly fresh, party on a Loui set
Bugatti boys, stunttin' with the paint wet
Yachts in fleets, nothing but a new piece
A gangsta Harley, custom with the suede seats
Ocean suites, five star condos
Gettin' how you live, stash in the dashboard
???
???, a nigga can't sleep
That's how I be, we let the day go
We shut 'em down homie, and let the cake blow
Uptown, Three Oh Five, Oh Four
That's all I know
Zoe, CMB gon' ride
???
Uptown homie, 'til I die
Miami, palm trees, sunshine

[Chorus: Black Dada and Redd Eyezz]
Tatted on my chest
Yes I'm a Zoe
I never had a problem getting dough
Making this music's all I know
So hold on tight cause Imma blow
In donk's Chevy, we ride
(Yeah, what it do Black)
At the club, we live
(Little Haiti in the building)
On 6"s and 7"s, we ride
(Another verse is on the way)
At any show, we live

[Verse 4: Redd Eyezz]
I'm talking about the best, yes I'm that Zoe
All the rappers show respect, 'cause I'm that Zoe
When the mob on the Chevy, like that's that Zoe
???, I'm a Zoe
??? ...to be exact
??? ...by the trap
???
Money so long, I got my eyes closed
???, as far as I know
???, for as far as I can go
Got love for the rappers that shoutin' out the Zoe
The hustlers and the thugs gettin' dope
??? ...it is what it is
I know you're up in heaven, hope you sayin' what you did
I'm whippin' these things like it's all I know
Chains so fresh, 'cause I'm a Zoe

[Chorus: Black Dada]
Tatted on my chest
Yes I'm a Zoe
I never had a problem getting dough
Making this music's all I know
So hold on tight cause Imma blow
In donk's Chevy, we ride
At the club, we live
On 6"s and 7"s, we ride
At any show, we live
