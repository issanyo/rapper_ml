[Spoken: B.G.]
Stay in line ho
Off top get ya mind right bitch (2x)

[Verse 1: B.G.]
Hoes gotta be tamed, bitches gotta be bat
They dont understand English, hoes gotta be smacked
Nigga beat 'em and stomp 'em
Barely feed 'em and fuck 'em
Don't get jammed, if ya got 'em
Better leave 'em don't love 'em
I be fuckin and duckin
Straight thug'n and plugg'n
I like pussy but I get turned on more if ya suckin
I don't be trustin no doubt
I goes all the way out
I'm bout hustlin, disrespectin, bustin you in yo mouth
Cause I'm bout real as they come, totally choppers and nines
Uptown's where I'm from keepin hoes in line
Believe I'm bout mine
Never wine and dine
Give me the grease and I'mma shove nine in ya behind
I ain't likes a kind, and I ain't tryin
Don't mind dyin
And when I do I'm dyin slangin that iron
I like 'em sexy and fine, I toss 'em, that's how it go
I ain't flossin but you gon' listenin, better stay in line ho

[Hook]
Pimpin ain't easy, better stay in line ho
Off top, you gon' respect a nigga mind ho

[Verse 2: Baby]
Nigga I stay shy, keep my hoes in check
Keep a pocket full of money, bank roll on fat
These hoes stay in line or get they grill straight knocked out
Stay in line or get put out your own house
I be hard on these hoes cause a bitch ain't shit
Every ho I done fucked done sucked my dick
Me and my B.G. we toss bitches
You don't believe me, ask Danielle and T.C., we ain't savin bitches
I got the game
He got the fame
Plus I got the change
Disrespect and puttin change on ya brain (playa)
Three of the finest bitches in the city on my team
Big body Expedition wit the gangsta lean
I wanna see all my homies get on they feet
For L.T., a G, with that gangsta lean (playboy)
So I can see all my homies ball in the U.P.T

[Verse 3: B.G.]
Bat a bitch quick, that's the modo I follow
Toss a bitch through the click, that's the modo I follow
If you real, hold a ho life in the palm of ya hand
If you can't control a ho to me ya ain't no man
Bitch, stay in line like the vice grip in the middle of the street
Any little thing I make ya taste, any little thing ya get beat
You gon' respect the B.G., or I'll punch ya in your nose
You gon' respect the B.G., or I'll whip ya out your clothes
C-M-R-ah gon' ride
No other thing gon' fly
Expedition and Mercedes cause a nigga like to shine
We in front and not behind, not on bottom, on top
Not on the side of nothin, hoes get flipped and flopped
My nigga ??? pimp a bitch, he a soldier for real
My nigga ??? whip a bitch, yeah he hard to kill
Uptown bout theirs', nigga I'm bout mine
Dogg hoes I share and I make 'em stay in line

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Mannie Fresh]
Never let these hoes take you away from yo ends
Drive high, ride fly, buy the big body Benz
And pass by they house, blow yo horn and laugh
When she come to the door say "you hoe!" and stare
To the next muthafucka that hated on you
Your baby mama full of drama, tell that bitch it's through
Cause when ya ain't got nothin these hoes don't want you around
And when you work to get paid, these hoes act like clowns
So what could you do to satisfy ungrate
Buy a car, treat her like a star, yet the ho still hate
Cause it's yo skills to pay the bills, nigga ride
Respect or eject, cause these hoes are tired
I'm on a mission to make. a million plus
Have platinum on the wall and ride the tour bus
Money over bitches, believin that for sho
Cash Money and the power, stay in line hoe

[Hook]

[Spoken: B.G.]
Beat these bitches, stomp these hoes
Ram they shit
