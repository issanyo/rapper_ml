And I'm ridin with a body on the shotti
Stretch a nigga out like pilates
Catch a nigga outside his hottie
Snatch all da honey from ya honey comb
Now the bee's keep flyin by me
I'm on that piff, that pody, that shit
Smokin like vladi, spendin dough from the 90's
Shinin p nony in the liming
I'm diming, don't time me muthafucka

I'm a young ass piranha
Don't get caught in that water
'Cause I'm waitin for a drowner
And on the corner
I got packs on the counter
Before ya bitch leave
I make Young Mob count 'em
Tryna get a dollar
I could turn it to a thousand
I'm so determined it's a economic problem
Drama
That's why I carry the limer
Ready at any given day I bury my honor
Love weed so much I try to marry... Joanna
So pass the pastrami and asparagus mama
I'm lunchin
'Cause in my area
If you got bread you better break it off and share in here-a
I got his ankles, and his stereo
Cause I could get a cool buck 50 for dat and the body yo
That's Hollygrove, it's Hollygrove til I adios
Gotta go
Gotta go
Got more bags to go, Yea!

And I'm ridin with a body on the shotti
Stretch a nigga out like pilates
Catch a nigga outside his hottie
Snatch all da honey from ya honey comb
Now the bee's keep flyin by me
I'm on that piff, that pody, that shit
Smokin like vladi, spendin dough from the 90's
Shinin p nony in the liming
I'm diming, don't time me muthafucka

Hot boy Wayne
Since the beginning
I've been in and out of some shit
Thinnin out the thick
Living out the script for the role that was chosen
But I don't want an award I'm tryna afford
Back to the road in the honda accord
The whole right side slam down with that raw
A city supply, the city get high
Like, if I was cleared I woulda touched Claudett... yeah
I'm so fresh like sex in the sheets
But, I'm from the dirty dirty like sex on a beach
The checks on my niks they match my carnesh
My button up shirt match my button seats
The AK 47 match my fuckin' heat
Watch your fuckin' feet cause I'm hot in the streets... yeah
A 1/4 thing is how I got in the streets
I had money ever since that week... Young Weezy!

And I'm ridin with a body on the shotti
Stretch a nigga out like pilates
Catch a nigga outside his hottie
Snatch all da honey from ya honey comb
Now the bee's keep flyin by me
I'm on that piff, that pody, that shit
Smokin like vladi, spendin dough from the 90's
Shinin p nony in the liming
I'm diming, don't time me muthafucka

My top don't roll up, it fold up
My money don't fold up, it build up
You niggas ain't fly get your gear up
Copped my bitch the Mark Jacob boots and the ear muffs
Got her lookin like Kamora or somethin
Brought Kamora to the south, now Kamora's stuntin
Yea we big business pimpin... chea
Walkin with a limp, talkin with a slurr
Barking at ya bitch, bet her pussy cat purr
She all on mine, she ain't lookin at yours
And if ya man trip, he get the blika bla blurr
Credit Wayne for bringin the hood back first... chea, chea
Credit Wayne for bringin the hood back first... chea
