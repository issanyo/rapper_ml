[Intro: Teena Marie]
West side girl is dipping
Off the chain, it's sickening
Lady Tee is
(Do you feel me)
Mmm

[Verse 1: Teena Marie]
Got your dinner waiting on the table
I've even chilled the wine
Come over, baby
Boy, don't be crazy
You've been waiting for a little something
And your girl's about to break you right off
You're about to know my name
Baby's off the chain

[Hook: Teena]
Got you feeling off the chain
She's sexing off the chain
She's flipping off the chain
Baby, your girl is ill
She's off the chain
It's sickening, off the chain
She's moaning off the chain

[Verse 2: Teena]
Mercury's rising and it's hot like fire
I'm feeling fingerish
About to lace you
Can almost taste you
West coast's popping all around your body
And my shit's of the hook in the South
You'll never be the same
Baby's off the chain

[Hook: Teena]
Got you feeling off the chain
She's sexing off the chain
She's flipping off the chain
Baby, your girl is ill
She's off the chain
It's sickening, off the chain
She's certainly off the chain

[Verse 3: Teena]
Did you ever think that we'd be making love like this
How can you resist me, baby, now that we have kissed
I've been saving all my love, for only you
West coast is on and popping
Boy, you den started something

[Birdman AKA Baby]
C'mon shawty from a G to a G
This is how it's gon' be and this is how we gon' eat, mama
I'm a pretty ..., you a top da noite
I'mma tell the people you gon' ride drop top
I untold the straps that ming on yo back
You riding in that Cadillac
I'm off tha chain with this pimping ass game
If I don't know nothing, I wouldn't move them thangs
And just a few that live to talk about it
Coming through the airport and they hotter than lava
Cruising rag top, the mink the colour of lava
Ride fly through the storm, collecting some dollars
...money and power
Shawty raised in the game, so know she can holler
To the sunset port of California
She a G to the game, she do what she wanna

[Teena]
West coast's got your chest on swole
Dirty South's insatiable
Northeast, tell me now what you say
Got your taste buds tanging like Alize
Lady's banging all out your back
Got your heartbeat racing like a heart attack
Going on and on to the break of dawn
And shit don't stop to the early morn

Off the chain
Off the chain
Baby's off the chain
Do your thang
Do your thang
This love is good
It's off the
Off the chain
Off the chain
Baby's off the chain
Do your thang
Do your thang
This love is good
It's off the
Chain
Chain
Chain
Uh

West coast's popping
It's off the chain
East Coast's flipping
It's off the chain
Midwest's banging
It's off the chain
Dirty South is off the chain
West coast's popping, it's off the chain
East Coast's flipping, it's off the chain
Midwest's banging, it's off the chain
Dirty South is off the chain

Got you feeling
Mm
She's fine
She's sickening
She's moaning off the
Your girl is I'll
She's off the
She's sick
And she's off the
She's flipping off the
She's freaking off the chain
