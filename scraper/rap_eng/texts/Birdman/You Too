[Verse 1: Birdman]
Candy red, candy on the new bed
Versace spread, hundred where a nigga lay
Where we played, brought her on another site
Ocean city view, hella choppers every night
G-5, take her on another spree
Shopping spree, for fucking with a G
YM nigga, YMCMB
Everyday the lugshery life of an OG
Persion rugs, chandeliers on the marbel floor
Berkin bags, Chanel with the glass doors
V-12, 7-60 with the new money
New ghost white pearl, bitch, Young Money
Higher than I ever been
Ocean water, jetskies, Gucci Bens
Brand new photo Bens
And everytime I come, I got my 2 block twins

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
I said, oo girl, you classy
Oo, girl, you nasty
Type to never ever put no drugs where your ass be
That's one of your best qualties, baby girl, if you ask me
You looking like a tough professor, it's hard for you to pass
This Purp got me high, man, I'm feelin like Phillis
Meditated murder, tonight I'm tryna kill it
You saying you been doing your key glows, well tonight I'm tryna feel it
Rest In Peace to Gary Colman
Don't need no translater to understand your body language
That ass must be part of the bloods, the way that bitch bangin
I ain't no vocal coach, but I'll have that pussy sangin
You seeing stars and stripes, you hereing bells ringin
Now tell me your secret, as I'm sliding off your Vickies
All blessings, dn't worry bout no quickies
We could get tipsy like some hippies, and Minaj like Nicki
So soon as you get home, hit me
