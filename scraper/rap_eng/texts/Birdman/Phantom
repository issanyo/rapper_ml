[Intro: Bangladesh]
It’s like a black man heaven here
My nigga 2 Chainz bringing 2 cups and extendo blunts
It’s all bay when that nigga baby pull up

[Hook]
Pull up in the Phantom, chaufer with the doors off
Hop out in the city, see a nigga showin up
Money in the air, a couple bottles pourin up
Fat lady singin at the opera, yea it’s over now
It’s over now, shit is over now
Fat lady singin at the opera, yea it’s over now

[Verse 1: Bangladesh]
Young nigga got stripes, bar code
I’ll be with your honey, buzzin like the bar closed
Choppers taking targets, shootin up marshals
Rolls, the pack’s money in the backseat, star mode
Phantom grills shinin like a new Porsche
And pardon me partner, I park it with my eyes closed
Front door lookin like a car show in Boston
Country then a mug, hold a child, where’s my cardinal?
Louie belt buckle, watch me rope em like the cattle pry
I give your ass a smack before I give your ass a ride
I shred it down, I arrive in the nick of time
I pull the choppa off the top and make you change your mind
You on enemy turf, she got me in a purse
20 grand for the rims, half a mill for the work
A couple bands, I make Rosanne sing Rihanna verse
Like oh na na, what that nigga worth?
All car precious, make that heffer come and sing in person
I’m so aggressive, any second I could switch to murkin
Like Figaro, tell your ho we ain’t come for flirtin
I shut that motherfucker down, closed curtains

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Real nigga poppin, money ain’t no stopping
Filthy bout my richest niggas, stuntin while we shoppin
Pull up in my 6-4, old school 4 door
Backseat Kaliko, 20 deep the flow show
Higher than we did, nigga search lights
Bright lights, hit the club every night
Keep dodging in the kitchen, cookin every night
Fuckin talkin bout the money, ain’t never light
Heavy duty, been a G on some cash shit
100 whips, 20 hoes on one dick
Fortune and pain the price to live the life
Gunplay, we smash a nigga on sight
Blowing big, lit up
The money comin, the gun’s took
My bitch shinin, them bottoms up
The bottles poppin, we blowin up
My young money nigga live a flashy life
5 star G, bitch I pay the price
Yeah, YMCMB
Billionaires, let’s get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I said it’s over now, got the rims poking out
Smoke before I go to trial
Sacks filled, poster child
I’m way colder now, on the mic I hachu
If I rule the world, benihanas, I have a drivethrough
I’m getting to the money times 2
Must I remind you?
If that pussy good I’mma try to fuckin sign you
And I’m from the side, where we trap and we round you
And she’s wet in my whip, carpool
I got a lot of fuckin styles in my arsenal
Step my money tall, I gotta stand on the bar stool
Shorty so smart she in law school
And her brain so good like she in jaw school
All I talk about is money ‘cause I’m getting to it
All I talk about is money ‘cause I speak it fluent
Ridin with the windows up and my music loud
I am sippin codeine and I’m using loud
Duffle bag in my trunk with the lights in it
Dip that pussy dry, I’mma pour some fuckin Sprite in it

[Hook]
