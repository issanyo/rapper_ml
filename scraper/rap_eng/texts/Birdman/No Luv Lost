[Intro: Derez De'Shon]
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I got love for some niggas that I'll never speak to again
Still got love for some niggas that never want to see me win
Ain't no love for these bitches, fuck 'em once and never again
I'm in love with these riches, hoping that the money don't end
Ain't no love lost (ain't no love)
Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no love lost, yeah (ain't no love lost)
Ain't no, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, nah
Ain't no, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost
Ain't no love, love lost

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
I got love for niggas that be calling, but I never will answer
Lost respect for a lot of niggas, see 'em, won't even dap 'em
Tried to assassinate a nigga character, but I ain't never been an actor
Nino Brown me a ho, fuck her once and then she cancelled
I know some niggas that gon' get offended
Only fuck I give is middle fingers
Ain't no need in us to keep pretending
I know you hate the fact that you see me winning
I know you hate the fact you see me in it
Exactly why I ain't get the windows tinted
Drop cash money on her, yeah yeah yeah, ain't no love lost, yeah

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I got love for some niggas that I'll never speak to again
Still got love for some niggas that never want to see me win
Ain't no love for these bitches, fuck 'em once and never again
I'm in love with these riches, hoping that the money don't end
Ain't no love lost (ain't no love)
Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no love lost, yeah (ain't no love lost)
Ain't no, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, nah
Ain't no, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost
Ain't no love, love lost

[Verse 2: Ralo]
I'll never love'em again, they taught me love was a sin, yeah
I got the money to spend, I don't have money to lend
I put London on the track, I put Versace on my niggas' back
Fuck with D-Bo and we come and attack
We bring them pistols wherever you at
I told my bitch I can't love her no more
I could never fall in love with no ho
I take that tool when they knock on the door
Stay out my business, you not gonna know
I'm not surprised these niggas be lying
Most of these niggas a doubt in my mind
None of these niggas is my type of guys
They got some heart, but they nothing like mine

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I got love for some niggas that I'll never speak to again
Still got love for some niggas that never want to see me win
Ain't no love for these bitches, fuck 'em once and never again
I'm in love with these riches, hoping that the money don't end
Ain't no love lost (ain't no love)
Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no love lost, yeah (ain't no love lost)
Ain't no, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, nah
Ain't no, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost
Ain't no love, love lost

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Eighty-six more bricks, ninty-eight more flips
Escalade and them candies, jumping out with them clips
Lace a bitch for them trips, mask up for them licks
Knock a nigga ho down, bustin' open them bricks
Hash out, this the stash spot, move out with the max out
Pussy nigga clear the safe out, come around with the cash out
Yeah, do this shit on the blaze nigga
Do this shit with some craze nigga
Do this shit or get sprayed nigga, get paid

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I got love for some niggas that I'll never speak to again
Still got love for some niggas that never want to see me win
Ain't no love for these bitches, fuck 'em once and never again
I'm in love with these riches, hoping that the money don't end
Ain't no love lost (ain't no love)
Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no love lost, yeah (ain't no love lost)
Ain't no, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost, nah
Ain't no, ain't no love lost, ain't no love lost
Ain't no love, love lost
