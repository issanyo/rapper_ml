[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm on a mission lil daddy to scoop in the Caddy go visit Ms. Gladius
B(ah) to A(ah) to B-Y BIATCH!
Somethin' so fly and somethin' so slick
24's, 28's, got to be better, 18's never, nigga whatever
It's the New Orleans finest BIATCH!
I'm a worldwide rider with that Gucci and Prada shit
Look like I got to uplift my Prada, get a few dollars, holla at a model
Nigga if it ain't money it can't beat me
That platinum from the neck, wrists, finger, and teeth
But I'm so so cool and I'm so so ooh
Get outta line watch me bust my 2
I ran out the house and I ran in the building
Them people was comin, "Hands up!" ya feel me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the bird of the nest
The shark of the sea
Hungry dog on the concrete that's tryin' to eat
Nobody move me cause I be who I be
The Uptown rider, the home CMB
I get what I want when I want I could have it
Lexus, Bentley, and the Jag nothin' average
Never got married but I'm lovin' Ms. Gladius
Birdlady in that brand new Caddy
I'm a boss nigga
Nothin' less, two boats no cost nigga
Fly nigga hold your hearts nigga
That what Daddy told you, Mommy told you
I stand my grounds, be a man homie
No quarters no halves, with them wholes thang
"Fuck it, pitch in nigga!" and don't fuck with them chickens man
Flip whatever: cars, rims, and bucks
Live this life like you don't give a fuck nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Do a doughnut, swing around, and come around the corner
Change feathers twice, come back with the homies
That fly shit, that Prada and Gucci sheets
Feather to the floor with swine on her feets
Bezel that glow with the 9 on the seats
And whether thats snow or white mink on me
See I'm hustlin' leathers and I'm chasin' cheddars
That's Eminem's bitch, it gets no better
With the wide D-lips with the custom leather
And I ball like a dawg Hood Rich forever
See I'm iced all up with that chrome metal
Fully equiped with the Coogi sweater
But it's the Birdman daddy, I run with the bird game
Birds got to have it with my birdy change
But it's the big thangs on the big Range, stop and goes
26's, 28's, it's the Birdman

[Hook 3X]
