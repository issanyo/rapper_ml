This is G
Straight up out the wars, from out the back of the projects
Where * pull cords and choppers get pulled out
Like you at the barber
Fresh up out the blue water like we at the harbor
This is my life (life)
A ghetto dream come true
Paper plates on the Benz, (Benz) ridin’ so new
On some 2011 * when I come through
Black paint, black seat
And the black rims, too
Can you see me *
I’m creeping on the low though
In the big-body four-door
With the four boy logo (logo)
Smokin’ * rolled up
In a damn * getting high as
* eagle dare drift (drift)
Ain’t that some damn *
And it’s true though
But it ain’t like I’m telling you
Something that you ain’t knew though
So don’t get it twisted like a noodle
I’ll put one in your noodle
And leave a * twisted
So what it do, Bro

The hollow , we make the gasoline chase you
Smoke that fire *, till the gasoline face you

Blue and yellow mirror, that’s my Indiana pacer
Black with the red beam, my Portland trail blazer
No playin’ where I’m from ‘cause we’ll trail blaze you
Don’t leave no *

But I swear * love every * I ever owned
Black head to toe with the Louis V. holster
Straight gangster, I match my four-door Porsche
