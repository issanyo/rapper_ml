[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide to infinity
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie oogie oggie, jiggle, wiggle and dance
Like the roof on fire
We gon' drink, drink and take shots until we fall out
Like the roof on fire
Now baby give a booty naked, take off all your clothes, and light the roof on fire
Tell her, tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fireball
Fireball

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I saw, I came, I conquered
Or should I say, "I saw, I conquered, I came"
They say the chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin’ he runnin’ the game
Now big bang boogie
Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade

[Pre-Hook: Pitbull]
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said “Walk this way”

[Hook: John Ryan]
I was born in a flame
Momma said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you've ever had
If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Fireball
Fireball

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I don’t care what y’all say
Cause as the world turns, y’all boys gonna learn
That chico right here don’t play
That boy’s from the bottom, bottom of the map
M.I.A U.S.A

[Pre-Hook: Pitbull]
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
“Walk this way”

[Hook: John Ryan]
I was born in a flame
Momma said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you've ever had
If you think I'm burning out, I never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Fireball

[Bridge: Pitbull]
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
Now, we're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
Fireball

[Outro]
Fireball
I tell her, tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fireball
