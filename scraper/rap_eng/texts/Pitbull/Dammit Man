When you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)

[Hook*]
(What? Fuck with us, what)

(Fuck with us, what)
Y'all really can't fuck with us
(Fuck with us, what)
Y'all really can't fuck with us

[Verse 1]
I'ma kill 'em in the club with this one
I'ma tear the club the fuck up
I'ma have 'em goin' to war over this one partna, just listen
If you don't want those things to click-clack
Take a few steps back because I'm playin fo' keeps
Go ahead keep playin with me and watch how I hit 'em in the head once again
For those who didn't believe in the kid y'all might as well be dead
Because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did
I'm like Ray Charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all
I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap and I'm outrunnin y'all
When I hit 'em from the back I got them mami's saying dammit man
When I put it in they mouth I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh (Time out! Whooo)
When I hit 'em from the back I got them mami's saying dammit man
When I put it in they mouth I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh
Put that up dammit
But me and you both know that these niggas ain't ready
They're just too petty, I'm just too deadly (Whoo!)

[Verse 2]
Pitbull's that underrated underdog killin' the underground
But that's just an understatement
It's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid
Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain, dammit man
But I don't plan it man because I do what I wanna do
Move what I wanna move
Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams
I'mma tell you like Biggie told me, cash rules everything around me
I could give a fuck about what you say about me
Cause when those things get pulled out and squeezed they'll spray about three
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes
Pit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro
(Time out! Whooo)
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes
Pit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro
So all ya'll amateur ass niggas do-don't try this shit at home
Pit's co-co-comin, runnin, gunnin fo-for that throne
