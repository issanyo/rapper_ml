[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. 305 checking in
Know we the united nations
We drumming from all cities, all countries
States, whole planets, it don't matter

[Verse 1: Tera, DDei & Estate]
Like heaven, this feeling of sadness, I've lost
The silence, just be here, I have paid the cost

[Chorus: Tera, DDei, Estate & Pitbull]
Well that's why I keep trying cause I'm flying all night long
I've cried a million tears tonight, but I'm breathing on my own
Mr. 305 checking in
Know we the united nations
We drumming from all cities, all countries
States, whole planets, it don't matter

[Beat break]

[Verse 2: Tera, DDei & Estate]
Like heaven, this feeling of sadness, I've lost
The silence, just be here, I have paid the cost

[Chorus: Tera, DDei, Estate & Pitbull]
Well that's why I keep trying cause I'm flying all night long
I've cried a million tears tonight, but I'm breathing on my own
Mr. 305 checking in
Know we the united nations
We drumming from all cities, all countries
States, whole planets, it don't matter

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Gotta get back on my feet, one day to another
Turn my back to the streets, tell that to my hunger
'Til I get 6 feet, I'm 6 feet deep
In this streets and they still taking under
No remorse, no regrets
No choice, no conscience, no respects
For the life of success, [?]
That must have been the middle of my chest that pumps blood through my vest

[Beat break]
