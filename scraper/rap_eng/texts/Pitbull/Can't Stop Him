[Intro]
Big dog Pitbull, It's Mr. 305 checking in
Hey you know we had having uh
Some drama with the label
Over there at TVT, Mr. Steve Gottlieb
But tell 'em like this: clear this
No matter what you do you can't stop me

[Hook]
We got them big things poppin, TVT can't stop em
Got them big things poppin, TVT can't stop em
Got them big things poppin, TVT can't stop em
Got them big things poppin, TVT can't stop em
Hey Steve watch me do it, do it, do it
Hey Steve watch me do it, do it, do it
Hey Steve watch me do it, do it, do it
Hey Steve watch me do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1]
We got them big things poppin, TVT can't stop em
Tell Steve, I don't care, sue me motherfucker
305 till the death man
You sold your soul to the devil
Now you owe your whole ass off to Def Jam
This no under the table the thing, oh no
Ask your whole damn label if they feel the same, for sure
White man, black male
What I mean to say is white man
Loves the black man for them record sales
I'm a slave to the game, I had to fight to get paid
But thanks Steve, I'm learning something new every day
I brought you Pretty Ricky, Daddy Yankee, Jim Jonsin
Wouldn't sign them 'cause I wouldn't let you extort them
Lil Jon got my back, Ying Yang got my back
DJ Khaled got my back, Mr. Collipark got my back
You can own what I rap
But you can't control what I say, fuck TVT

[Hook]
