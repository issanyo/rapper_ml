[Intro: Pitbull (Anjuli Stars)]
(Umm... Umm... Umm... Umm...)
Anjuli Stars... Pitbull...
This is dedicated to anybody that's lost somebody important in their life
Don't worry they in a better place now

[Verse 1: Anjuli Stars]
I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
Cause I'm dying each time that I breath in life with out you
Every hour is solemn I need you
I'm devoured, I've fallen now what can I do
There is so much to give
If only I had my hands to fix what you did
So I hold it inside
Watch as it dies
I can't even look at the sky
It's burning my eyes
Similar to cigarette smoke
I wish I could float far away from here

[Hook: Anjuli Stars]
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away, Washing me away
Washing me away, Washing me away

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Still dealing' with the death of my father
Still dealing with the death of my best friend
Eddie I'm a miss you dog
But you know I'm a ride to the end, I love you
I ain't cry when you died
But i'm a let my tears fall on the track
My brother Uly just came home
And it feels good to have him back
Welcome home dog
See everything happens for a reason
You don't know what you have till it's gone
That's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathing
And the words of this song
Are dedicated to Eddie and Barilla
But I know in the future I'm a see ya
I know you both looking down on me proudly
I know ya'll both love me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
See in Life things go wrong
If it don't kill it's only gonna make you strong
So you must hold on
If everything was right then there is something wrong
Ironic ain't it, that's just the way life is
That's why I thank God any chance that I get
For blessing me with beautiful kids
What's victory with no loss
What's smiling with no tears
What's love with no hate
What's courage with no fear
Just think about it , and apply it to your life
And no matter what the problem is, don't worry baby
Keep your head up it's gonna be alright

[Hook]
