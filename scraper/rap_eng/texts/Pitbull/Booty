[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty

Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty

Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
But most of all, you are just absolutely bootyful (Ain’t that a freak)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Have you seen her on the dance floor?
She got the boom, shake the room
That’s the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes, and it starts to make you wonder (Ain't that a freak)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor
Go on let them jeans touch you while you're dancing
(Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty)
It’s his birthday, give him what he ask for
(Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty)
Let me show you how to do it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Work)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Shake that)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Go to work)
Big, big booty, what you? (Ain't that a freak) Huh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
The way she moves, I know you want her
She light the fire, get you right
That’s the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you gotta touch her
Hold on tight for the ride
'Cause you know you gonna love her

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor
Go on let them jeans touch you while you're dancing
It’s his birthday, give him what he ask for
Let me show you how to do it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Work)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Shake that)
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Go to work)
Big, big booty, what you? (Woooo, ain't that a freak) Huh

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty everywhere
Look at her booty, stop, stare
They love that booty, hell yeah
The way she twerk it, not fair (Haha)
She got a booty that’ll swallow a thong
And if you do it better, do it dirty all night long
Booty, toot it, boot it, you know the plan
So much booty, she could supply the demand (Ain't that a freak)
I wanna take that big ‘ol booty shopping at the mall
I wanna pick it up and put that booty in my car
Baby, your booty is a movie star
Oscar award winner of them all
Now give me that

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
Mesmerized by the size of it (Oh-oh-oh)
You can fight it if you like take your time (Oh-oh-oh)
I can guarantee you’ll have the time of your life
Throw up your hands if you love a big booty

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
Big big big big big big booty, what you
Big big big big big big booty, what you
Big big big big big big...
Let me show you how to do it
Work
Shake that
Go to work (Ain't that a freak)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty
Big, big booty, what you got? A big booty (Shake that)
