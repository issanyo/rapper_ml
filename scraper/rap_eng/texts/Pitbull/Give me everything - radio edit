Me not working hard?
Yeah, right, picture that with a Kodak
Or better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak

Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-yo, Tesra

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love

(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Get busy tonight
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to do battle, perform for princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless

It's insane to wait and they ain't growin' money
Keep flowin', hustlers move beside us
So I'm tip-toeing to keep blowing
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my lap, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight

Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should
Tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handled love

(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab them, at least you're on top of the
World
Think about it
'Cause if you slip, I'm gonna fall on top of your girl

When I'm involved, it goes deeper than them aces
Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My family is from Cuba, but I'm an American Idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest

Put it on my light, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight

Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should
Tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Don't care what they say
All the games, they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love

(Let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Excuse me but I might drink a little more than I should
Tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'ma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow
