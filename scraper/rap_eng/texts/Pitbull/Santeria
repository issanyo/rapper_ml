Pitbull... now ready
Concentration camp..

[Verse 1]
I spit it the best like pregnant pussy
Stand on the ledge and they're there to push me
I'm over the top, i'm over those fully automatics
I'm over the Glock, bitches like "uh ah Pit is hot"
I on the track or I in her asshole
Or ah when i pull out and let that nuts splash her
Like Mike "Peosa" Pitbull will catch you
Niggers wanna hurt me cuz i spread like herpes
Contagious with the flow... Danger! hit the floor
One in the chamber, oh and there's plenty more
But that just came from jaw just they ain't ready for
The serious; seriously you're gonna die
And like a coward no more that you ain't ready to ride
I'm tryin' to get ready you guys
Fuck youre family ties
Over an onion these niggas'll make you really cry

[Hook] (x2)
I'm too smart, too cool
Too grimy, too dirty, too rude
Too street, too snake, too smooth
A Pitbull is too stupid to loose

[Verse 2]
Get some baked soda and some pure coke
A bitch to cook and you gon' smell with the rock is cookin'
I'm from the state that's shaped like a gun
That's how we gon' step to the war so when it's hot ya better duck or run
Here goes another one
Now that the bottom is properly represented
Off that plate you better save me some
I'm starvin' to eat
I'm carvin' your meat with a fully auto
And greet y'all teflon niggas with nothin' but hollows
My mottos are hard to follow
After the DUI's it's hard to  catch me in the VIP poppin' a bottle, no
Poppin' a model, yes
Once i get that chance I'll holla at ya niggers so that you can run to her next
Like C. Wallace, is there life after death?
Now that puzzles
Me like the Bay of Pigs ima shit on the US
"targs" ya can't muscle me

[Hook] (x2)
I'm too smart, too cool
Too grimy, too dirty, too rude
Too street, too snake, too smooth
A Pitbull is too stupid to loose

[Verse 3]
When i drop your albums are gettin' push back
Like convos lettin' bitches gon' ask "Who's dat?"
Quien es ese blanco como la leche ojos azules
There becomes on the with beat con mas "roz que un gandile"
Like the 1st n 15th you get cut like checks, or get cut like coke
Or get cut like a bad athlete when this bad ass heat
Spit some bad ass heat at your bad ass niece (whoo)
I wanna see you talk now
And since you talk what you walk i wanna see you walk, now with no knees
See what happens when you and your
"so called cold D's, flossin' blow G's" y'all ain't ready fo' me
I'm too smart, too calm, too cool
Just one bullet to hit three, all y'all fools
Left three hit, two dead and one bruised
3, 2, 1... You loose

[Hook] (x2)
I'm too smart, too cool
Too grimy, too dirty, too rude
Too street, too snake, too smooth
A Pitbull is too stupid to loose
