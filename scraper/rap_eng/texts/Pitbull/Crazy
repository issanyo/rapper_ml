I came through to catch up with you,(See what ya wanna do)
I see ya out there actin' a fool,(That's not too cool wi-th you)
You're all upon some other chick, I'm like he's on some other shit
I ain't even gonna stress you

And it's crazy, ya want me to be your baby
But that shit there won't phase me
I'm tellin' ya boy you're crazy, you're shady
And it's crazy, ya want me to be your baby
But that shit there won't phase me
I'm tellin' ya boy you're crazy, you're shady

I know ya beat me here but it's cool (Keep up ya little move)
It's not my style to act up like you (I'm just observin' you)
To flip or wanna start a fight, to cool ****
This time around I'm gonna be cool

And it's crazy, ya want me to be your baby
But that shit there won't phase me
I'm tellin' ya boy you're crazy, you're shady
And it's crazy, ya want me to be your baby
But that shit there won't phase me
I'm tellin' ya boy you're crazy you're shady

Pitbull:
(Hahaha)
(Check this out baby , I'mma holla at 'chuu right here)
Man I ain't new to the game, I ain't new to this thing
I'm off this chain and you know thiss
I've been watchin' you move, I've been watchin' you do all the things that you do
And it's drivin' me crazy
You've been freaky, sexy, nasty
I'll do anything that ya like just ask me
See baby you and me baby drive eachother crazy when we get freaky
It's promiscuous, far from manogamous
If you get it, you got it, I hit it, you gone
Now bend over baby let me play with ya thong
And if you act right baby I'll let ya play with my tongue

I ain't in love with a stripper but I'm gettin' this wrong
One time we keep gettin' it on
I showed her my hmmmm, she showed me her hmmmm
I'm like you crazy, she like you crazy
