It's Mr. Worldwide, Agent A, reporting live
From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe, let's ride

Back, back, in, in, time

Baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

Miami equals black mask, black gloves
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would (Okay)

Okay, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, vulture
Dummy avoider, record-breaker
Won't ya
Give credit where credit is due, Don't ya
Know that I don't give a number two

Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

Baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men in Black I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to

What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles

Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future, we have to go back in time

Baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

(Let's)
Excuse me baby
(Go)
Yeah you baby
(Back)
Ooh you groovy baby
(In)
Let's make a movie baby
(Time)

Excuse me baby

Baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
You're the...

Baby, oh baby
Oh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one
