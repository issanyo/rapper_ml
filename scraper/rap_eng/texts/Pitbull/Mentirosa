[Verse 1]
Up in the club
Fuck VIP
P to the I...I to the T
Ying to the Yang
Up in this thang
D to the roc
My Nigga Kaine
Up in the cut
Pouring it up
Rolling it up
Holding it up
Ain't her breast swollen or what?
Yes sir yes sir
Oh we gonna take it back like theives and foes
Nasty as I wanna be
That makes me 2 live for your crew
Ho get down get low
I'm crossin these mammas like tic tac toe
Let's ride let's go
Get loose get crunk get drunk get blown
Thats right let's roll
MIA ATL fo sho

[Verse 2]
All the lil mamas all around the world
Shake that ass if you a nasty girl
Back that ass up says juvenile
Show a nigga some tities like girls gone wild
Tear off this clip of clothes, I wanna see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road
Where niggas go to see naked hoes
Shake that shit bitch
And be off in the club with a hard ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit
Put a hump in your back
And lick it raw
To a 3 point stance
But you mess up yo ass
You must be on that kanye work out plan
Like head shoulder knees hoes

[Verse 3]
Take 'em out in cruise
Take 'em out all dressed
Is the realest true niggas in the ATL
Yeah we break it down betta shake a booty ho
And them hoes and the girl with the real tight clothes
One time for the gang with the ying yang twins
We already know we off the reel
Dont tolerate that talkin
Bitch you can get the walkin
Patrollers is where I'm groaking
The only way that we are talkin
If your breath smells like mine
Girl don't give a fuck cause you fine
I diss 'em fo I kiss 'em
I pack 'em fo I stack 'em
So while we in the club betta get these girls
Cause on the streets there ain't no action
