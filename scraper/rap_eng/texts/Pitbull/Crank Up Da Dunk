[Verse 1:]
Deep in seven duce-dos dogs
Going to the club, coolin' with the thugs
We gon rock, get high, hope to fly
When we in the 305, we get live (Nigga What!)
I'm looking for some ho to fuck
I'm with my dawgs
And we looking for some hole to fuck
That's right, gon cop something
We hit the studio with y'all something
Them niggas can hate
Before we clip the Glocks on em
So stop fronting, you know what we all about
We from the same, so you know what we all about
It's like who the hell
Get your money, get your hoes
We gon put it down for our city
You know how it is
Nigga we loose and we all about I's
Deep in the club, nigga all of us stars
Get your beef, get your coke, get trees
Get your tokens, get your keys

Fuck you nigga, I'm quick to clown
And we coming back from the {?} and shit
Hoe nigga, Imma get you now
When I come through, we in a circle
I mean, whoever who in ya circle
Money I do wanna dirty slime
And these many times I got to alert
All your homeboys about to bezerk
And you're the reason nigga shout Miami
Tours is taking a route for Miami
We keep the hoe niggas out of Miami
So bitches 'bout Miami

[Bridge: Money Mark]
Nigga crank up da dunk

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I say kindness is for weakness
These palm trees and blue skies
Is to keep you outta town, nigga speechless
Cause the last thing we need is leeches
You leech ass niggas better stick to those beaches
I'm from the city where the sun's hot
Fuck sunblock, when them guns cock
Fingers inch, trigger click, guns pop
Oh and problem when them guns blaze
They'll burn your ass a little more than sideways

[Hook: Money Mark]

[Verse 4: Money Mark]
Let's take it to the streets, where young niggas like me
Come through 7-3 lord draw in the breeze
With a pocket full of cheese, trying get me a beat
Pull up to the club on duces
Only way you get in the front bitch, you best be elusive
No more truce, and all those hoes
Tryna get a nigga dough with some rabbit ass hands
Do me favor, climb in the back of da dunk
Let me pump up da funk, and hit your chin with my jaw
Keep a tech in the trunk
Lay back bitch, but the beat keep me crunk
Come to your spot, two Glocks in the pump
Nigga fuck what you need
Imma give you what you want, how it gotta be
Me in the dub late night by the robbery (by the robbery)


[Hook: Money Mark]
Nigga crank up da dank
Turn up the funk
Nigga lift up the trunk
Pull out the chomp
Nigga roll up the funk
Nigga blow out this skunk
When you pull out da dunk
Nigga lift up the trunk
Nigga turn up the funk
Nigga pull up the blunt
Nigga blow out the skunk
Then back to the bar
