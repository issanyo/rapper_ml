That lil chico behind close door's a solider baby
Just like Master P, there ain't no limit
I thought I told you baby
Besito mamita donde tu quieras
That means I'll give you kisses wherever you want
And maybe uh, drive you crazy
Lemme do the things you like

And think with an open mind
And ooh, now fantasize
I can't wait to get home, to get it on
But for now, mamita rica
Send me kisses through the phone like
