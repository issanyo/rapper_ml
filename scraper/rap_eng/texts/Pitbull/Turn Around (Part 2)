Don't believe me watch and see

Drink all night
Nothing less
Wake up hungover
Onto the next
My English can
But my women
You meet em greet em and need em
I meet em greet em and eat em
Feast - I'm an animal, monster
Beast - you on her
That means you got Mary
Not me, I'm just here to unleash

You got me still stuttering

I don't have the words to say
When you shake it my way
You got me still stuttering

Break that booty down
