Rabiosa
If you don't get enough, I'll make it double
I got my boy now in big, big trouble
You know I want you, atracao ahi ratata
You've got a lot of sex appeal
Don't play around because I'm for real, yeah
You see that road isn't meant for me
You know I want you amarrao aqui

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
Oye papi, if you like it mocha
Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca
Oye papi, if you like it mocha
Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca, aha, aha

[Chorus: Shakira]
Rabiosa, ah, ah, rabiosa, ah, ah
Come closer, come pull me closer
Just say rabiosa, ah, ah, rabiosa, ah, ah
Come closer, come pull me closer, ah
