[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Aha, aha
Well how’s that girl doin’ that there?
On the pole, with her toes way back there
Strike a pose, then we throw a little stack here
But your clothes ain’t on, now is that fair?
Quit teasin’ these niggas like that
Cause you got a real nice fine back
I’m looking at you, looking at my swag
Woo woman, had to tear your gas
Maybe you just need a real good paddlin’
I slap you on the booty with a stack of tens
Tell me [?], I’m doing my do-do, with a thick young bitch named Judy
Half Afghan and part African, so what’s hatnin’ and?
Ask her “so why she work in the club?”
She said to get these niggas drunk and take they bucks
