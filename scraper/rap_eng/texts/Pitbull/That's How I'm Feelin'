[Intro: Ciara and Ester Dean]
Polow, you a fool for this one
You did that girl!

[Chorus: Ester Dean]
Tell me, tell me now
Boy do you like that? Boy do you like that? Boy do you like that?
I, I, I know that you like that, know that you like that, know that you like that
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Cause I did that, yea cause I did that, yea cause I did that
When I’m stickin' that ass out, when I’m stickin' that ass out
Let’s get it

[Verse 1: Ciara]
I don't know you but I'm tryna impress you tonight
I'm feelin' chill but I'm gon' shake it a little tonight
I ain't easy but I might just go with you tonight
If that's how I'm feelin', that's how I'm feelin'

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
Hey, hey, ooh, feelin'
Hey, hey, ooh, feelin'
Hey, hey, ooh
If that's how I'm feelin', if that's how I'm feelin'

[Chorus: Ester Dean]
Tell me, tell me now
Boy do you like that? Boy do you like that? Boy do you like that?
I, I, I know that you like that, know that you like that, know that you like that
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Cause I did that, yea cause I did that, yea cause I did that
When I’m stickin' that ass out, when I’m stickin' that ass out
Let’s get it

[Verse 2: Ciara]
I don't drink but I might take a few shots for tonight
I might get fucked up but at least I'll be feelin' just right
And I don't love you but I might say I love you tonight
If that's how I'm feelin', that's how I'm feelin'

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
Hey, hey, ooh, feelin'
Hey, hey, ooh, feelin'
Hey, hey, ooh
If that's how I'm feelin', if that's how I'm feelin'

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I know what you feelin', I know what you got
I know what you need and I know what you want
Veronica Vega, dale que tu puede que tu estas bella
I see you baby, big thighs, small waist, cute face
I wanna please you baby
Explore your private parts in a private place
Excuse me baby, but life is a deck of cards and you my ace
And when the time's right 10-9- 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1

[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
I might call up my friends, hang out if that's how I feel
I might drop it low and pop a cartwheel
See me poppin' and poppin' and jumpin' like a Coupe de Ville
Ain't no stoppin', we rockin', we got a drink so chill
If I see a fine dude I'm like come here
Them chicks alright, baby I'm the real deal
Cause me and CiCi, H-O-T emoji
You know me, when I get toasty, it's on bae
Get it, get it, get it, get it, go pop that thing
Don't care what you say, go pop that thing
Go 'head, go 'head, go drop that thing
Go 'head, go 'head, go drop that thing

[Bridge: Ciara]
Get it, get it, get it, let's get it
Get it, get it, get it, let's get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Let's get it (If that's how I'm feelin', if that's how I'm feelin')

[Chorus: Ester Dean]
Tell me, tell me now
Boy do you like that? Boy do you like that? Boy do you like that?
I, I, I know that you like that, know that you like that, know that you like that
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Cause I did that, yea cause I did that, yea cause I did that
When I’m stickin' that ass out, when I’m stickin' that ass out
Let’s get it
Tell me, tell me now
Boy do you like that? Boy do you like that? Boy do you like that?
I, I, I know that you like that, know that you like that, know that you like that
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Cause I did that, yea cause I did that, yea cause I did that
When I’m stickin' that ass out, when I’m stickin' that ass out
Let’s get it

[Outro: Ester Dean and Ciara]
You did that girl
You did that girl
You did that girl
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
