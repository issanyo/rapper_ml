[Intro]
This my way of letting my city know that I'd ride for 'em
I'd cry for 'em, Bust 5 for 'em, And most of all fuckin die for em...

Hey, 305...till I die (5X)

[Hook: Lil'Jon] (x2)
Nigga I ride for my motherfuckin clique
I die for my motherfuckin clique
I bust heads with my motherfuckin clique
Talk shit, watch my shit go click

[Verse 1]
Man I've been on the grind
1 in the head, 16 in the nine, I'm extra man
The game is mine in due time
It's alright I'm patient man
I know how to play my position, I know how to play my part
I know how to play these bitches, I know how to play with they hearts
I've done some dumb things, but for the most I've played it smart
Who cares if you run things? Cause I'm as live as 106 & Park
This game is nothing but a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks
Only the strong survive; It's do or die get it right
That why I roll for my peoples
Cock back, go to war for my peoples
Break bread with my peoples
Man, I'll die for my peoples
Everybody knows it's the truth
That why they respect everything that I do, everywhere that I go
Every friend, every foe, every bitch, every ho
Man I sold it all
From the weed to the X, from the X to the blow
Mark my words, I'm next to blow
P to the I, I to the T, T to the B, B To the U, Double the L
Me, Ima sell like ice cream in hell
This for my peoples that's locked up in jail
Ima succeed, I'm never gon fail
Papo just watch me

[Verse 2]
Man I'm watchin the game closely
Uncle Luke that man did coach me
He taught me the who, what, wheres and whys
How to cross T's, How to dot I's
Little did he know he created a monster
Pitbull nigga I'm that monster
D.B. them chicos is monsters
Lil' Jon that nigga's a monster
Everybody in the clique is well equipped
Ready for Pit to take over shit
This here is not a game, this here is our lives
We can't fuck this up, we gotta get it right
If you with us and you ready for war then lets ride
Lets show how we do in the south
Kick in they door, run in their house
Since them boys think they spit fire
Fuck it, put the gun in they mouth
Follow me now, all these bitches wanna swallow me now
All these niggas that I don't even know wanna holla at me now cause they wanna be down but fuck'em man
Me, I'mma turn it up a notch
To my hustlers be careful when they murder in the blocks
To my killas be careful when you burnin up the Glocks
Last thing you wanna be is runnin from the cops
Pit's gon take it from the bottom to the top
Haters can hate but it ain't gon stop
Everybody knows I'mma blow just listen to the flow
This chico got it on lock
