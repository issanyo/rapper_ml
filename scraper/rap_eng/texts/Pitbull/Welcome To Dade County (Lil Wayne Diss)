[Intro]
Mr. Worldwide – I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Mouth signed check, ass can’t cash
One-time Lebron boss, D-Wade flash
I can’t forget that boy UD, Udonis Has
I’m from Miami Dade County, born and raised there
Mouth full of golds and diamonds, but talk is cheap
There’s rules and codes, in Dade Country streets
Y’all break rules and codes to talk shit on beats
No te equivoques mi hijito, Miami’ll bring the heat

[Hook]
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
Welcome to Dade County…
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
[Woooooooooooooooooooh!]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Here's a deposition, watch what you speak
Who’s the definition of Miami? Me
I move cultures, don’t believe me – watch and see
Ask Barack Obama, he’ll bet the White House on me
You got money, yeah – yeah, that’s sweet
But we all know Baby and Slim really eat
You talk Miami, if you talkin’ heat
Moral of the story: don’t shit where you eat

[Hook]

[Outro]
I had to do this for my city dog
It’s something that I love so deeply
I don’t wanna be 305 Miami Dade County
I am 305 Miami Dade County
I bleed 305 Miami Dade County
So when we show love to those
That get their city destroyed by a hurricane
And then they come down here
Y faltan al respeto
Hazme el favor y para de comer tanta pinga
Eso es lo que pasa cuando uno da la mano
Y quieren el brazo entero
