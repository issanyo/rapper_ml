[Intro : Pitbull]
I'm falling in love with party, friends and alcohol
I'm falling in love with party, friends and alcohol
We falling in love with party, friends and alcohol
That's why I'm falling in love
Falling in love, with you tonight

[Verse 1 : Enrique Iglesias]
Spent my whole life waiting
For a girl like you
Baby tell me what I gotta do
We can leave this party
Back to my room
You could show me a thing or two

[Pre-Hook : Enrique Iglesias]
Cause I've been spendin' all my money
On these pretty girls and alcohol
But honey they ain't got a thing on you
You shoot me once, you shoot me twice
Now take me to your paradise
You know there's just one thing left to do
Let me show you what I'm talking 'bout

[Hook : Enrique Iglesias]
If you let me be your lover
I'd do anything for you
I could rock you like no other
Oh oh, come on girl get loose
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 2 : Enrique Iglesias]
Baby shake that body, now turn around
Slow motion for me now (oh yeah)
Girl you got me going, I'm going down
Yeah you know what I talking about

[Pre-Hook : Enrique Iglesias]
Cause I've been spendin' all my money
On these pretty girls and alcohol
But honey they ain't got a thing on you
You shoot me once, you shoot me twice
Now take me to your paradise
You know there's just one thing left to do
Let me show you what I'm talking 'bout

[Hook : Enrique Iglesias]
If you let me be your lover
I'd do anything for you
I could rock you like no other
Oh oh, come on girl get loose
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

[Verse 3 : Pitbull]
I'm the mailman, I deliver
Take her to dinner, conversate a little
Then I split her down the middle like Miami's river
I like my women one up one down
Kerry Kittles, here's a riddle
What's the opposite of walk? Run
What's the opposite of go? Come
That means I hit it, I run, you come
Fe fi fo fun, tear the club up
All my sexy ladies that came to lose their minds
Put you hands up high, tear the club up
She ain't looking for a man
She just looking for a really good time
That's right, tear the club up
Let's drink that Voli
And forget what we doing tonight
Tear the club up
I ain't trying to be your lover for life
Just your lover tonight, that's right

[Hook]
If you let me be your lover
I'd do anything for you
I could rock you like no other
Oh oh, come on girl get loose
If you let me be your lover
I'd do anything for you
I could rock you like no other
Oh oh, come on girl get loose
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
