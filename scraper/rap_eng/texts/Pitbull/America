[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I love her, you know her like I know her
So powerful, so beautiful, it's crazy to think
The things that she'll do to you
She'll change your life
She'll give you the freedom to be what you want
She's doing nice, she's the only one

[Nick Cannon]
I climbed on the bar to see her
Everybody in the world wants to meet her
I drive thousands of miles just to take a picture
So beautiful and magical I dripped and bust since I was a little boy

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Cannon]
So I need to find her, she is a special girl
Nothing is like her, I search for her around the world
I wanna make her mine, think of her all the time
She'll never leave me, she'll never leave me

[Chorus: Nick Cannon]
Her name is America, she is my lady
I swear to protect her, oh so amazing
Her name is America, she is my baby
I promised to love her, more than God above us
She is America, and I want her
She is America, and I love her

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Oho, America, America, ooh, that girl
Oho, America, America, ooh that girl

[Verse 2: Nick Cannon]
Fight to people
Battling, they want her, they try to steal her
Pick my armor up and put my spears down
She's my number one, the only one I wanna stay by her side

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Cannon]
So I need to find her, she is a special girl
Nothing is like her, I search for her around the world
I wanna make her mine, think of her all the time
She'll never leave me, she'll never leave me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
America baby, hold on baby
Wassup baby, go ahead baby
Maybe we can jump off in the car
Drop the top and look at the 50 stars
Dressed with skin tight, red, white, blue
Her heels like ooh, and I was like ooh
Baby go and lie, maybe later on we can hit my spot, right
She know Trina and her girlfriend Gina
Going back and forth like they was Serena
On Monday I'm seeing Erica, but God bless America

[Nick Cannon]
Twerk it, twerk it, twerk it, to the dawn's early light, light
Mami in the club, full of stars, we got stripes
Walk it out in the sound, tryna get them civil rights
It's Mister Worldwide and your man Nick Cannon
We salute her all night

[Chorus]
