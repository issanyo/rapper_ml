When I see her on the dance floor
In the night light
She makes me say "Wepa"
When I see her on the dance floor
In the night light
She makes me say "Wepa"
Gloria and Mr. Worldwide, it's senseless
Go ahead and add another one to the hitlist
Latinos taking over, don't believe me it's cool
Check the census
It's Miami's finest Cuba's princess
And we coming hard like the world against us
We run the game
They ride benches
The world is ours now
No more trenches
I'm taking it all, breaking 'em off
Lettin' them know I'm ready for it all
It's family baby Miami baby
Gloria, Pitbull Grammy baby
Emilio olvidate chico que este Cubanito, Armandito esta loquito
Me gusta las mujeres Caliente y fresca
Pa'que tu lo sepa, dale Wepa
To start the party's what I came to do
I don't care with who so how 'bout you
Give up your worries and outdance the moon
'Til the sun comes through with the morning view
(Give it to me like)
Hey everybody
Every body's got a rhythm
That'll make you wanna move it
Like they do in South Beach
Gotta watch the women
When you see their bodies spinnin'
With the face, twist the waist
Like merengue in the streets
Wepa

Wepa
Pa'que tu lo sepa, dale Wepa
Pa'que tu lo sepa, dale Wepa
