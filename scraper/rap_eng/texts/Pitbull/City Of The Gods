[Chorus]
Pa-ra pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa
(repeat 4x)

[Verse 1 - Pitbull]
Woke up this mornin' with my pockets on E
Fuck being broke men this shit ain't for me
I'm lookin' for a lick, was sh-ttin' on them bricks
Makin' it rain in the club, outside jack boy shit
Make them strip in the dough

Drop that shit, hit that flow
Blow that shit, that's the show
'Cause if you do them things would go pa

[Chorus]
Pa-ra pa-pa-pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa-pa
(repeat 4x)
