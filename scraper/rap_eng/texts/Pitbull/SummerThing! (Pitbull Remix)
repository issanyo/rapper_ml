[Intro: Pitbull]
Afrojack, Mr. Worldwide
This is for all the freaky, kinky, sexy things that happen with a summer fling
Now hit 'em with that summer thing

[Verse 1: Mike Taylor]
I don't wanna write this love song
I, I'm fighting this urge
But you make me say ooh, damn
Cause I, I can't find the words
I don't wanna write this love song
Just wanna dance all night 'til it hurts
But you make me say ooh, damn
Cause I, I can't find the words

[Chorus: Mike Taylor]
You stole my heart, we had a summer fling
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
But you made me fall in the winter
Bloom in the spring
From June to December, it was you and me
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
That it was just a summer thing

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Maybe I'm feeling you a little bit too much
But I like the way you feel and you touch
And I like the way you kiss and you cuss
And I love that it's not love, it's lust
Now baby, sit back and relax and think about the man that you're with
I went from the block to the jet to the yacht
And from being 'round keys to a house in the Keys
[?] I got aim where they're not
I aim where they wanna be
It's been like this since I handled the rock
I'm a seasoned vet
And when it comes to women, I try to please 'em best
I'm not a player, baby, I just love sex
Now let's get into these freaky other things
And make this a wonderful summer thing

[Chorus: Mike Taylor]
You stole my heart, we had a summer fling
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
But you made me fall in the winter
Bloom in the spring
From June to December, it was you and me
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
That it was just a summer thing

[Bridge: Mike Taylor]
Always remember the summer, the summer thing
Hope you always remember the summer, the summer thing
I will always remember the summer, the summer thing
Hope you always remember the summer, the summer thing

[Chorus: Mike Taylor]
You stole my heart, we had a summer fling
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
But you made me fall in the winter
Bloom in the spring
From June to December, it was you and me
And I told my heart it was just a summer thing
That it was just a summer thing
