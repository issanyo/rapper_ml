[Intro: Havana Brown]
You take my heart out on the run
But the more that you leave
The more I wanna come
You make me feel like I'm chasing a shadow
Cause you always run
Al-Always run from me

[Verse 1: Jamie Drastik]
She don't wanna let go (let go)
And I feel the same (same)
But there's one thing I know (I know)
Is that love is pain (pain)
And even though I'm in a rush (rush)
We make time to touch
Can't slip, trip, fall in love
I'm an underdog but want all of the above
Rock and roll is a rocky road
A lot of stop and go's
I gotta rock the show (let's rock)
I know it sounds harsh (harsh)
I know it's so wrong (wrong)
But the worst things is
That is turns you on

[Pre-Hook:Havana Brown]
You take my heart out on the run
But the more that you leave
The more I wanna come
You make me feel like I'm chasing a shadow
Cause you always run
Al-Always run from me

[Hook: Havana Brown]
Shadow oh oh oh oh oh
Chasing a shadow oh oh oh oh oh
Chasing a shadow oh oh oh oh oh
Chasing a shadow oh oh oh oh oh
(cause you always run, al-always run from me)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
She was like "Armandito come here"
I was like "mamita don't play"
Felt right, we know we both wrong, right
It's only one night "yeah right"
You don't believe that
Once you feel me where you breathe at
Once you feel me where you bleed at
Believe me, you gon' need that
It's all fun and games (fun 'n' games)
Till someone get's hurt (till someone get's hurt)
You think with your heart
I'm thinking how to get into your skirt (pull it up)
I know it sounds harsh (harsh)
I know it's so wrong (wrong)
But the worst things is
That is turns you on

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
She knows what I like (like)
Does everything right (right)
But the more she comes (comes)
The more it comes with a price (price)
She don't know my life (life)
But she say that she wants to (wants to)
And no matter where I am (am)
I could be the one she runs to (whooo)
It sounds good when you say it (say it)
But I'm not the one to play with (play with)
I feel the heat from your presence (presence)
I leave it in thirty seconds
I know it sounds harsh (harsh)
I know it's so wrong (wrong)
But the worst things is
That is turns you on

[Pre-Hook + Hook]
