[Intro: Lil Jon]
Hey! Let's go!

[Hook: Lil Jon]
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm that little chico from the bottom
Will everybody say I'm mister, mister 305
That's what they holla
Who got Miami off the, off the, the, chain, chain
Pitbull, that's who, that's right, that's me
And don't you ever forget
I'm that little chico that take it to the grave
Take it from the M.I.A to A-Town
Without braking down, down, down
I'm talking keys, talking pounds
But that's not my life now
Funny thing, half of these boys that rap
Don't know coke, don't know crack
Down know this, don't know that
They just make me laugh, laugh, laugh
I don't know 'bout them but me
I'm bout my cash, cash, cash
And it make my dick harder
Watching my money stack
I don't gamble, no C-Lo, no craps
Them boys from the A
They like damn, he can snap now
Spray from side to side
And make a [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
Chillin' in the bip, yeah we get crunk
Niggas poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk
Rollin' up the kush, put it in the air
I'm throwin' up the E's to let 'em know we in here
Brand new shoes, brand new tool
Pull out the ol school, cause I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah I'm from the 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my Glock BITCH!
Reppin' my block BITCH!, straight from the deck
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on the best, we don't fuck wit dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this
Yeah I'm back to the track, back to the snap
1, 2 step, then you gotta lean back
This is how we do it in the A town
(and if you ain't know) this how it go down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
Straight from da bay, posted in the 'A'
Bout to hit the club, we been mobbin' all day
Drinkin' on some Rossi, dyin' off Patron
VIP style, strapped wit my chrome
Look around the club, what do I see
Everybody rockin' from side to side to the beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to the groove
All by they self, that's the new move
Nigga where I'm from, we like to go dumb
I'm soakin' up the game, I'm seein' how its done
I ask shawty what they call it, she said the Pool Palace
Staright from Bankhead, I said you good at it
Do what cha do, you and ya crew
They even got playa's and thugs doin' it too
The mo' that I drank, the more it's lookin' smooth
I's nuthin to a boss, I can do the shit too

[Hook:]

[Outro: DJ Ideal]
Hey! Hey!
