[Intro: Ariana & Pitbull]
When I hear the ocean calling
And I feel my spirit falling
I remember old Sorrento
Where I fell in love with you
Love a romance in the garden

Yes, it's the immigrants
Taking over
Mister World Wide
Fly yo Arianna, salute
Let's have some fun!

[Chorus: Pitbull & Ariana]
When I hear the ocean calling
Sexy people (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Sexy people (Back to Sorrento si)
Sexy people (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Sexy people (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Sexy people (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Sexy people (Back to Sorrento si)

{Verse 1: Pitbull]
I was born in Miami, my blood is from Cuba
Cuban America don't let me fool ya
Hazme favor, y deja la buya
Any doubts, has corulla
I've been around the globe, ripping and ride it
Dippin' and divin', runnin' and gunnin'
Sleepin' and slidin', go ahead try me
You can't, it works too hard to deny it

{Chorus: Pitbull & Ariana]
Take me to Sorrento, keep me undone
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, let's have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, let's have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, let's have some fun
Sexy people all around the world (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
The night is young, let's have some fun (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Sexy people all around the world (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
The night is young, let's have some fun. (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Let's have some fun
Let's have some fun
Let's have some fun

{Verse 2: Pitbull]
I live for the freedom, ride for the freedom
Die for the freedom, family of Cuba, all for the freedom
That's why all the opportunities, me lo como, I eat 'em
Global dominance, known through all
Seven continents I flirt with the earth
She loves when I whisper in her ear and pull up a skirt
What a dirty girl

{Chorus: Pitbull & Ariana]
Take me to Sorrento, keep me undone
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, let's have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, let's have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, let's have some fun
When I hear the ocean calling
Sexy people all around the world (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
The night is young, let's have some fun. (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Sexy people all around the world (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
The night is young, let's have some fun. (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
When I hear the ocean calling
Sexy people all around the world (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
The night is young, let's have some fun.  (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Sexy people all around the world  (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
The night is young, let's have some fun. (Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento)
Let's have some fun
Let's have some fun
(Take me to Sorrento)
