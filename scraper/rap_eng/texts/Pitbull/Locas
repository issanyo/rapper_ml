[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm the only Cuban dead or alive
More famous than Castro
He's a rebel, I'm a rebel
He's a genius, I'm a genius
Only difference is, uh, he's an a**hole
Hay mamita si cocinas como caminas, mi hija
Te como hasta la rapa
When I **** her from the back
I be playing with the kitty
Having all the little ladies going Gaga
All these mamis wanna act loca
I love me, I love me, I love me some locas
The world is mine like Tony
And I dress to impress like Sosa
We could do it in the car, plane, yacht
I just wanna f*** that box
I just wanna f**k you out
I just wanna turn you out

Only chico from the 3-0-5
Take it worldwide, and still lowkey
Your boy's got the keys to success on lock
Ask Tony Robbins about me
I like that she likes what I like
I like that she likes my type
I like that she likes what I like
I like that she likes wild nights
So I kiss em, lick em, freak em, stick em (yeah)
Meet em, greet em, eat em, beat em (yeah)
She says she's a Vegan
But she likes to eat raw meat (yeah)
We can talk that talk (mmm-hmm)
We can do what they do (mmm-hmm)
We can freak that freek (mmm-hmm)
And we can s****  ***** ***** (Woooo)
