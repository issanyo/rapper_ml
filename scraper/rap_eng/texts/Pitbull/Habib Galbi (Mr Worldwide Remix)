[Hook]
*Beat Break*

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm b-b-b-b-bad to the bone
I move like DeNiro in casino, mind is Sharon Stone
Ass Uncle Luke, boy that man put me on
My money ain't young, my money full grown
Every private jet, pink flown
Mami got mouse [?] full blown
I'm sitting on a treasure, bitch that's the fools good
She told me I was the first, who you fooling ho?
I hated algebra, but I love to multiply
And everybody knows, that this chico more tired
Catch me in a sharp ass suit in Marinbero style
No tie, except I'm a hollywood star, that's right

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook: A-WA]
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Them boys a good fella, low key mover
Yeah they cool, but me I'm smoother
I used to serve the bass line like John starks
Now I play the game Steph Curry style
Behind the arc, ha!
It's how you finish, not how you start
If it wasn't for the music, I'd tear the block apart
Tear your town, tear your city, tear your state apart
Buddy I lived, Papo y'all just played a part
I hated algebra, but I love to multiply
And everybody knows, that this chico more tired
Catch me in a sharp ass suit, no tie
Enjoying club mile high, that's right

[Pre-Hook+Hook (x2)]

[Outro: A-WA]
