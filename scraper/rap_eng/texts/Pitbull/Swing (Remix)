[ Chorus ]
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it low and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it low and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING

Verse 1
Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips SWING - and - look - just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell "Savage where the chorus at?!"

[ Chorus ]
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it low and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it low and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING

Verse 2
Uh oh, let it pop, ladies drop it like it's hot
Hell yeah, that's the spot, now bring it back to the top
Stop! Woah, now back it up, now back it up
Let it rise then watch it dump, shaking your junk in the trunk
And - I - like - the way you move it smoothly
Now why - don't - you move that booty - to - me
I'm tryna come up with some thoughts of attack
Until I heard somebody yellin' out "Savage where the chorus at?!"

[ Chorus ]
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it low and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it low and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING

Bridge x2
Knees bent, ass out, come on push your ass out
(Let me see your hips swing)
Bring it up then back down, bring it up then back down
(Let me see your hips swing)
All my ladies on the floor, all my ladies on the floor
(Let me see your hips swing)
Pick it up then dip it low, pick it up then dip it low
(Let me see your hips swing)

[ Chorus ]
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it low and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it low and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
