Rihanna this inspired me mamita
So you know Mr. worldwide had to check in
This beat’s perfect for me to teach the world a little bit more about me

[Verse 1:Pitbull]
Before you speak, listen
I always make it happen
I don’t believe in wishing or wishes or should've or would've or could've or can't or won't
So don’t, don’t come to me with that there
Epitome of irony, I’m a gentleman bastard
Burn me, throw me in the ocean, ya'll can keep the casket
I see who you not so let's see how long that mask fit
My whole life’s been a flagrant fail but somehow I still made the basket
Yeah they all tough behind the mic, I bet
Until they get they ass kicked
I’m a diamond in the rough I ain't cut right
And make sure when you cutting things that they're cut right
I don't floss, I don't rock ice, but if you listen and learn
Then I just might
Show you how I took my life from soft white
To playing cards with Rihanna at the same night
In Tokyo baby, let's ride
Now that’s what you call two diamonds in the sky

[Hook:Rihanna]
Shine bright, tonight you and I
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Verse 2:Rihanna]
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we’ll never die
We’re like diamonds in the sky
You’re a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I’m alive
We’re like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Hook]
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Hook]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
