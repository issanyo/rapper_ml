[Hook: Priyanka Chopra (Pitbull)]
Cool me down
I'm feeling so exotic (Red One)
Yaa right now...
I'm hotter than the Tropics
Take me down (Mr. Worldwide)
Mumbai Cuba baby let's go (Priyanka)
La-love me all the way to Rio

(Desi girl)
I'm feeling so exotic

Tumko jo dekha maine
Toh maine ye jaan liya hai
Pardesi babu ne
Iss desi dil ko maan liya hai (x2)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm like Bon Jovi...
I'm wanted dead or alive
And you all better get with it
And in the music game
I'm worth more dead than alive
But that's okay, I live with it
That's why I live everyday like my last
Priyanka step on the gas
From Morocco to Mumbai
Bollywood to Hollywood is all about the money
Hey!

[Bridge 1: Priyanka Chopra]
Baby it's so beautiful
Must just play and see
But if you want the world
I suggest you come with me (come with me)
La-la la la la... (Come with me)
La-la la la la...

[Hook: Priyanka Chopra (Pitbull)]
Cool me down
I'm feeling so exotic
Yaa right now
I'm hotter than the Tropics
Take me there
Mumbai Cuba baby let's go
La-love me all the way to Rio

(Desi girl)
I'm feeling so exotic

Tumko jo dekha maine
Toh maine ye jaan liya hai
Pardesi babu ne
Iss desi dil ko maan liya hai (x2)


[Verse 2: Pitbull]
To Cuba's free, I can't go
But I'll meet you in Rio for sure
But before I make a pit stop in Miami
Home of the Heat and the old school photos
Got women by the boat loads
Went from Tootsies, Rolex and Cocos
To the Exhumers, Turks and Caicos
No more rumors maybe say say SOS
It's a fact that Pit is no liar
Give me a radio we'll take the entire
Ms World & Mr Worldwide
You already know that this thing is on fire

[Bridge 1 + Hook]

[Bridge 2: Priyanka Chopra]
Suba!
Suba!
