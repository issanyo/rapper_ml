[Intro: El Chombo, *Pitbull*]
Hah, welcome to the crypt!
*Mister Worldwide*

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
All the women with their hands up
All the women with their hands up
Puerto Rican, Colombian, Cuban, Dominican, Venezuelan
Panamanian, Mexican, white, brunette, cinnamon, candle

[Chorus: Cutty Ranks]
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, ay!
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, baby, give it to me

[Verse 2: Pitbull, **Karol G**]
Whippin' this on home field, I am the devil, Romeo the saint
Mister 305, Mister Worldwide
All my business partners they call me Armando (Armando)
Let's go to Chile, it's the fat, dancing, enjoying, finishing
Beauty schools around the world
Then if you got a question, ask Fernando
Give mommy, you're the rich one, give me your little thing, mmm
**Go ahead, crazy, you're the rich one, give me your little thing, mmm**

[Chorus: Cutty Ranks, *Pitbull*, **Karol G**]
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, ay
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, *baby, give it to me*
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, ay
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
(Move over here, move over there)
Little thing
Ay!
Little thing

[Verse 3: Karol G]
She looks at me and says "How nice, how nice," that moves me
And that she dances only with him on the dance floor
And the DJ plays with the stories of the midrib?
And now El Chombo & Pitbull say "give me your little thing"
Latinos, Greeks, Caribbean, Chinese, Africans, and the United States arrived
To the world that goes around dancing and dancing to this remix
Karol G obviously stuck (ay!)

[Chorus: Cutty Ranks, *Pitbull*, **Karol G**]
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, ay
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, *give it to me*
Little thing
Ay!
Little thing

[Post-Chorus: Pitbull]
If you get money, put your hands in the sky
She likes money, money
Give her more money
She likes money, money
Give her more money (To the hook!)

[Chorus: Cutty Ranks, Pitbull, Karol G]
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, ay!
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, *baby, give it to me*
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
Give me your little thing, ah, ay!
Give me your little thing, ah, ah
(Move over here, move over there)
Give me your little thing ay, take
(Your thingy)
Give me your little thing ay, take (ah)
(Your thingy)
*Give me your little thing*, **ah, ah**
*Give me your little thing*
