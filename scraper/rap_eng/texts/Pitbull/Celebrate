[Intro]
Mr. Worldwide, let's celebrate

[Hook]
I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we makin' history
I just wanna celebrate

[Verse 1]
We've been around the world, same song
Work hard, play harder, all day long
All the continents get jealous over me
You can see me, 3D overseas
If you know me then you know where to find me
Off in the Bahamas with a bad one behind me
Now live it up, live it up, live it up
Baby pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

[Pre-Hook]
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play

[Hook]
I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we makin' history
I just wanna celebrate

[Post-Hook]
Turn it up
Turn it up

[Verse 2]
I've been patiently waitin' for you to shake it and shake it
Make it or take it, the point is we made it
Quarterback the game, call us Tom Brady
And it's not our fault that we have all the ladies
But it's hard to see these ladies when your middle name's Equator
All around the globe, matter fact, see you later
They're great, we're great and we're world dominators
And we're also some smooth operators

[Pre-Hook]
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play
And we gon' vroom vroom around the world
Vroom vroom, gon' get it girl
Vroom vroom, that's the way we like to play

[Hook]
I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we makin' history
I just wanna celebrate

[Post-Hook]
Turn it up
Turn it up

[Bridge]
Live it up, baby
It's a good time, that's what we're givin' you
Now live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up
Live it up, live it up.... what you wanna do?

[Hook]
I just wanna celebrate
I just wanna celebrate
Tonight we makin' history
I just wanna celebrate

[Outro]
Turn it up, let's celebrate
Turn it up, let's celebrate
