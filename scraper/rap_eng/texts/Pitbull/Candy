Yeah

[Verse 1: Far East Movement]
You a candy girl, I get it from her mommy girl
The way that you been runnin' through my mind
Mess around and pull a hammy girl
Tryna get them panties girl
Hotter than a beach in Miami girl
And I ain't got to press my luck
Cause 'round here is big money
No whammies girl

[Pre-Hook: Far East Movement]
Cause after this Corona
I'm tryna have a face down
So when I walk up on her
I'm checking from the waist down
I spend a couple on her
We headed to my place now
So when I walk up on ya
I'm checking from the waist down

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I come from the bottom, I learned how to hustle
Armando the new Emilio, Slash Russel
El Nino, a mover, a shaker
So fat knicks but they won't shake
Now I'm like mama don't talk, just shake
I ain't got time to burn, or bake
She had a face full of mag, but her mind made up
Had no tracks, I respect that
Baby you earn that
X marks the spot, just tell me where to turn at
She said she got to be the worse, 7:38
I'm ready, you ready, let's play, like
Hmmmmm, let's play, like a vibrator, let's play
Hmmmmm, let's play, like a vibrator, hmmmm

I like the way you moving mama
When I see you in them pajamas
Let me wrap this thing around your neck
Yeah baby let me Mardi Gras ya
When I put my body on you
Break through that body armor
Keep it presidential
You can be my first lady, I'll be Obama

[Pre-Hook + Hook + Bridge]
