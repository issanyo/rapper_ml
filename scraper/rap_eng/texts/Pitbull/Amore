[Intro: Pitbull]
They're dying to kill
And living to die
Snub nose, headshots
If you touch anything that's mine
Respect, Loyalty
Dan la vida para la familia
They live for the honor
They'll kill for the honor
They'll die for the honor
Wise guys take life from the box
Look judge in the eyes
Put they hand on the bible
And lie to you, only to leave something to the coroner

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
From the law, from the feds
Fuck cops, pop pop
Catch you at your favorite spot
Well dressed little men but dangerous
Go-getters, hustlers, gangsters
Everything organized
And if they hit us its a prize
One to the heart and two to the brain
Looks like he lost his mind, let's ride
There's rules and codes
You don't break them for no one
Unless you're a fool like that fucking prick
Sammy the Bull

[Hook: Leona Lewis]
Amore, mio, Amore
I've waited for you
To save me tonight
But you left me dying
Slowly Inside
Amore, Amore, mio, Amore
I've waited for you
To bring me to life
But you left me dying
Dying inside

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Three piece suit with a piece by the waistline
Just in case a motherfucker wanna take mine
Imma get mine, get theirs, get yours
Cock back, click-clack, gimme that fat line
Mob royalty, walk out that court not guilty, filthy
But yet so fresh, so clean
So gentleman, so mean
So loved, so hated
Yeah I killed, yeah I extorted, yeah I robbed
But I'm the God of the mob, fuck it I made it
From nothing to something, scum to thugs
Thug to gangster, gangster to mobs
To no pot to piss in the pasta and lobster
Bitch I'm a rockstar
The king from Queens
That killed and died for his dreams
The rotten apple from the Big Apple
The realest gangster you've ever seen
John Gotti (Teflon Don!)
The rotten apple from the Big Apple
The realest gangster you've ever seen
John Gotti (Woo!)

[Hook: Leona Lewis]
Amore, mio, Amore
I've been waiting for you
To bring me to life
You left my dying
Dying Inside
Amore, Amore, mio, Amore
I've been waiting for you
To bring me to life
You left my dying
Slowly Inside
