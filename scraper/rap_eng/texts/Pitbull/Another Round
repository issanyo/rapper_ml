[Intro: Nicola Fasano, Alex Gusta, Pitbull]
Yea you know
If party was a competition
We'd be the world champions (ha ha)
Nicola Fasano!
Alex Guesta!
This one goes out to all my true
Hardcore party people out there
Where is the party?
Here is the party
Mohombi! Mr. Worldwide
Put it down with Mr. World Wisdom
So lasso that thing up
Are you ready, let's go!

[Hook: Mohombi]
Tonight I just want to party
Tonight I just want some fun
Tonight I'm a little horny
So I gotta get me some
Tonight Imma get in trouble
Cause I'm a son of gun
Tonight I just want to party
So give me another round

[Post-Hook: Nicola Fasano , Pitbull]
One time for my people in the disco
Two time for my people on the dancefloor
Lasso that thing up (people on the dancefloor)
Three time for my ladies on the strip pole
We just wanna make it girl (ladies on the strip pole)
Come on over, come on over
Y dale loquita que tu puede

[Bridge 1: Mohombi, Pitbull]
Let's go to the coast of Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico)
Turn up in Rio De Janeiro (De Janiero)
Don't keep the music esperando
Came on over, Come on over
Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, Dale

[Bridge 2: Alex Guesta]
Don't stop, give it to me now, give it to me now
Don't stop, give it to me now, put your drinks up
Don't stop, give it to me now, give it to me now
Don't stop, give it to me

[Bridge 3: Alex Guesta, Nicola Fasano]
Where is the party?
Here is the party

[Hook: Mohombi]
Tonight I just want to party
Tonight I just want some fun
Tonight I'm a little horny
So I gotta get me some
Tonight Imma get in trouble
Cause I'm a son of gun
Tonight I just want to party
So give me another round

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Dale!
Mami I just ride you and giddy giddy up
And giddy giddy up
Take you to the room like giddy giddy boom boom
Biddy biddy boom boom ba ba
And taste tu fruta de bomba
A tremendo batito papaya
Como dice El Cata, dale muyaya, rodeo

[Bridge 1: Mohombi, Pitbull]
Let's go to the coast of Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico)
Turn up in Rio De Janeiro (De Janiero)
Don't keep the music esperando
Came on over, Come on over

[Bridge 2: Alex Guesta]
Don't stop, give it to me now, give it to me now
Don't stop, give it to me now, put your drinks up
Don't stop, give it to me now, give it to me now
Don't stop, give it to me
