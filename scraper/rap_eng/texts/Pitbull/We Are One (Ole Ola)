[Hook: Pitbull]
Put your flags up in the sky (put 'em in the sky)
And then wave 'em side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show 'em where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one, love, life)

Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
When the going gets tough
The tough keep going
One love, one life, one world, one fight
Whole world, one night, one place, Brazil
Everybody put your flags in the sky and do what you feel

[Bridge: Pitbull]
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
Es mi mundo, tu mundo, el mundo de nosotros
Invitamos a todo el mundo a jugar con nosotros

[Hook: Pitbull]
Put your flags up in the sky (put 'em in the sky)
And then wave 'em side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show 'em where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one, love, life)

Jenni, dale!

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
One night, watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight, and a million eyes
Full heart's gonna work so hard
Shoot, fall, the stars, fists raised up towards the sky
Tonight watch the world unite, world unite, world unite
For the fight, fight, fight, one night, watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight and a million eyes
Hey, hey, hey, força, força come on sing with me
Hey, hey, hey, allez, allez come shout it out with me
Hey, hey, hey, come on now
Hey, hey, hey, come on now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Hook: Pitbull]
Put your flags up in the sky (put 'em in the sky)
And then wave 'em side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show 'em where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one, love, life)

Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola

Cláudia Leitte, obrigado

[Verse 3: Claudia Leitte]
É meu, é seu
Hoje é tudo nosso
Quando eu chamo o mundo inteiro pra jogar é pra mostrar que eu posso
Torcer, chorar, sorrir, gritar
Não importa o resultado, vamos extravasar

[Hook: Pitbull]
Put your flags up in the sky (put 'em in the sky)
And then wave 'em side to side (side to side)
Show the world where you're from (show 'em where you're from)
Show the world we are one (one, love, life)
