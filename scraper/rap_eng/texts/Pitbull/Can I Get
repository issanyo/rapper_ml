[Pre-Hook]
I feel so much better
I know I said I'll never, ever drink again
But now I feel like I never had before
I get out on the floor
And show them what it's for

[Hook x2]
Can I get that 'Tron? Can I get that Remy?
Can I get that cold? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rock?
Can I get salt all around that rim-rim-rim-rim?

[Verse 1]
Can I get that
When I walk up in the club I hit that
Shawty, wanna break me off like a k-k-k-Kit Kat
Get a couple bottles and a couple models and I wanna sip that
'Tron, when I'm in the zone
Can I get that Henny when I’m already in it?
Can I get that margarita when I’m chilling with a mamacita?
I'ma see you later on tonight
I know, I said I should stay in my bed
I’m in a club instead party-rocking with my baby
So now I’ll never say never, she’ll leave me if I let her
That’s why I gotta keep her on the dancefloor and tell her

[Pre-Hook]
I feel so much better
I Know I said I’ll never ever drink again, again, again
But now I feel like I never had before
I get out on the floor and show them what it's for

[Hook x2]
Can I get that 'Tron? Can I get that Remy?
Can I get that cold? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rock?
Can I get salt all around that rim-rim-rim-rim?

[Verse Two: Pitbull]
I'm ready for whatever, whenever, y'all know the game
It's Mr. Throw-a-Bone & Pain, y'all know the name
Didn't go to private school, but now it's private planes
And we stay around the world in hotels under private names
Bartender, give me a Voli-water-lime
Put your drinks in the air, it's Voli time
Everybody rap about vodka
Only difference is, this low-cal, and Voli's mine
I don't mean to brag, so don't think wrong
As a matter-fact, Pain, let's get our drink on
Mama over there named Judy
And she got a tutti-frutti-juicy booty you can put a drink on
Everybody got they cups but they ain't chipped in
Know what that means? They ain't drinking
These type of things happen all the time
You better get yours, 'cause I'm gon' get mine, dime

[Pre-Hook]
I feel so much better
I Know I said I’ll never ever drink again, again, again
But now I feel like I never had before
I get out on the floor and show them what it's for

Can I get that cold? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rock?
Can I get salt all around that rim-rim-rim-rim?
