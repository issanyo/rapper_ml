[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull & Both]
If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor (Hey)
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah, we work on the floor
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor (Hey)
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza (Woo!)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor (Yeah)
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more (Hahaha)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull & Both]
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor (Así mismo, así mismo, así mismo)
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor (Woo!)
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I am not wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor (Yeah)
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more (Hahaha, woo!)

Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Woo!)

[Verse 3: Pibull]
That badonkadonk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
Seven-trey donkey donk (Yeah)
All I need is some vodka and some chonky Coke
And watch, shit gon' get Donkey Konged (Hahaha)
Baby, if you're ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me, dale
Don't believe me, just bet me (Hahaha)
My name ain't Keith, but I see why you sweat me (Hahaha)
