Cataracts
Who says history doesn't repeat itself?

[Verse 1]
This is what legends are made of
Carlos Santana and Pit
We making history, baby
Like Nelson Mandela did!
Hosted the AMAs
Ratings went straight to the sky!
And I ain't talkin dope
When I say it's an 11 year high
It's a legend in the making with the legend itself
Ya, go ahead and get rich
Me, I'm here for the wealth!
Get, get, get right
Or get, get, get left
Ahora canta mi gente
Dale Tito Puente!

[Chorus]
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata!
And tell me what you want
What you want, I got it!
You just let me know
Let me know if you're bad
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata

What I got, you want it
What you got, I need it!
What I got, you want it
What you got, I need it!

[Verse 2]
Made this song from Miami (that's right!)
This song for the family (that's right!)
I don't care about awards
Because my kids can't eat grammys
I bleed it, I breathe it, I've seen it, I lived it, I done it!
Went from Miami's most hated, to the world's most wanted!
It's a legend in the making, with the legend himself
Ya go ahead and get rich
Me, I'm here for the wealth!
Get, get, get right
Or get, get, get left
Ahora canta mi gente
Dale Tito Puente

[Chorus]
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata
And tell me what you want
What you want, I got it
You just let me know
Let me know if you're bad
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata

What I got, you want it
What you got, I need it!
What I got, you want it
What you got, I need it!

[Chorus]
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata
And tell me what you want
What you want, I got it
You just let me know
Let me know if you're bad
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata
Oye como va, mi ritmo
Bueno pa gozar, mulata...
