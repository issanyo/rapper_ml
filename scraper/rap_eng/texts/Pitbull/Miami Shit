Hop in the bucket and haul ass
Fuck em, Hop in the bucket and haul ass
Fuck em, Hop in the bucket and haul ass

This is for them boys on there way to Tennesse listening to M.J.G
Breaking dem birds and 8-balls
Be careful with them keys
Don't hesitate to squeeze
Watch out for them feds 'cause they hate y'all
Bank accounts overseas
When them feds come for me all they gon find is cd's no weight dog
But wait dog
'cause Pit is back, bigger badder stronger its alright you can hate dog
But don't be surprised if a chico do you like they can escape then blow your motha fuckin face off
Who the fuck wanna face off
'cause I'm willing and ready to cock, aim and bang
Show the world what it means to be born and raised
In the home of the 'Canes thats the county of Dade
Well they used to shoot straight phase now they shoot ak's
So if they kick in your door I suggest you do what they say
These are the facts of life minus them three bitches
They don't rap no more
All they do is snitchin
I went from no pot to piss in
To gettin taught how to whip up a pot in the kitchen
Listen
Cook Cook whip whip chop chop oh
Hear the shots don't look stop drop roll
Hit the block tell them fiends stop cop go
Used to be my life but not no more

Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass
Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass
Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass
Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass

Take my banana clip to a banana click
Now thats some Miami shit
Give me your big old shit
With a ton of bricks
Now thats some Miami shit
Chevys on 22's 24's' 26
Now thats some Miami shit

Thats right thats what thats right thats what thats right
I'm from Miami bitch

I eat sleep shit talk rap
See that seven forty five LI yeah I bought that
They never thought but I thought that
Give em a brick baking soda and a beaka and its brought back
Pyrex to be exact I bring it back
How you want it from the stove or the microwave?
How you want it? how yella? or light brown
I Feel like Method Man I got him feenin with they pipes out
Let's ride out and reminisce on them days
When dey used to jack tourists everyday in Dade
Thats how JT Money got his name
Miami all it equals is tons of cocaine
This is what we grew up and
Learned to do
These cubans'll teach you bout a bird or two
Keep acting like these boys won't murder you
Down here the sun ain't the only thing burning you
This where the bitches go two ways
Niggas love gunplay
And a triangle equals a one way
If you know what I'm talking bout then you from Dade
If you don't then welcome to where I been raised
The bottom
Welcome to where I been raised
The crib
Welcome to where I been raised
Magic city
Welcome to where I been raised
305 County of Dade

(Let's Ride)

Hop in the bucket and haul ass step on the gas step on the gas
Fuck em, hop in the bucket and haul ass step on the gas step on the gas

Take my banana clip to a banana click
Now thats some Miami shit
Give me your big old shit
With a ton of bricks
Now thats some Miami shit
Chevys on 22's 24's' 26
Now thats some Miami shit
Thats right thats what thats right thats what thats right
I'm from Miami bitch
