[Intro]
Oh, no
Yeah
Ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry
Juicy J
Mr. Worldwide
Aha
Let's rage

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (enemy)
Your enemy (your enemy), your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (walk away)
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I'm an outcast, I got that
Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
And that's just a start
My life I took it from the back to the front
Rosa parks
Who cares what they blink or they bought
Who cares what they think or they thought
Baby we can do it in the car
In the kitchen, on the floor
In the middle of the park
I'm here to play with that little bitty thing
I pump blood through your veins, your heart
And all these little players, acting like they can hate
But they can not
Can't, won't, don't, never will, be real
One, two, three, four times, Cypress hill
Hey Ms. Perry
Looking sexy with your fine self
Want a little bit of magic, I'm maverick, top gun
If you look and look no further you got one
I got 'em confused
Is he Hispanic or is he Caucasian?
Don't worry about where I'm from
Just know one thing, I'm amazing

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (you should know)
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse (like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (a perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
