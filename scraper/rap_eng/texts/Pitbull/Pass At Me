Timbaland
Everybody say
Dance on the floor and give it up
Baby, put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up

Everybody say
Dance on the floor and give it up
Baby, put it down and give it up
Nigga, set the floor and take it up
Baby, put it down and give it up

So listen a couple girls
Who was in and I mess with a couple girls
Magazines, you can catch me on a couple girl
I created my own plane to cover the Earth and cover the world

I spit so sick so I put 'em on girls
She's tryna come over
And she burn my perms
She tryna come at

Of all of my hurts, place to be
But I made at my girls
Now she just wanna say
Just wanna please
She want it, so she lives on her knees

Jack and Jill, went up the hill
Each back up in a corner, you came back with 250
What a working girl, now work it girl
Like, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah
Like, ah ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah

Timbaland
Hey girl, I like what you're doing, what are you doing, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like what you're doing, what are you doing, oh oh my God
Oh oh my God
Oh oh my God

Oh oh my God
What are you doing?
I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me
I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me

I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I like when I see you break it down like you in control

I got a girl on the right and one cover left
With Timbaland and I'm out of breath
So go g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o, so g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o

I got a girl on the right and a girl on the left
And one in a middle, and I'm feeling their breath
So go g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o, so g-g-g-g-g-g-g-o

Timbaland
Hey girl, I like what you're doing, what are you doing, oh oh my God
Hey girl, I like what you're doing, what are you doing, oh oh my God
Oh oh my God

Oh oh my God
What are you doing?
I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me
I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me

I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me
I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me
I love, when you, make, a pass at me, a pass at me

Pass at me

Pass at me
Pass at me
