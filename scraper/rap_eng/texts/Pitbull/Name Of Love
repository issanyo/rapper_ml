[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide, Jean Roch, RedOne

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Last time I shed a tear, was when my father died
But now he's good up in the skies
So I'm gonna make this song cry
I see them haters looking at me
Tryna indict my soul, tryna read me
Tryna see what I know, ha ha but no

[Verse 2: Jean Roch]
Feel the night
I got no pain to share with you, all right
Though we can share it, about to live your life
Living along, just enjoy your life, enjoy your life
Celebrate in the name of love
Celebrate in the name of love

[Hook: Nayer]
Never felt this good, Don't you worry
I'm feeling like I should, ooh whoa
Never felt this good
Don't you worry, oh oh oh
Never felt this good
Don't you worry
I'm feeling like I should, ooh whoa
Never felt this good
Don't you worry, oh oh oh

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Cante y no llores, el amor es lleno dolores mami
I want you to listen, don't hear me
I want you respect me, don't feel me
This life is crazy, baby
Now I want you near me, help me
Cuba, miami to paris, life is short, let's cherish
I'mma kill this, make love to you
With you and your girl on top of the terrace
I'mma feel this, and since my father died
Baby, i'm tearless, I see the future
But I live for the moment
Make sense don't it
Time is money
I don't know about you, but I own it dale

[Verse 4: Jean-Roch]
Feel the vibe
Now we can done it here, you soaked tonight
Let's take it higher, fly the satellite
No one can take away my inner life, inner life
Celebrate in the name of love
Celebrate in the name of love

[Hook: Nayer]
Never felt this good, don't you worry
I'm feeling like I should, ooh whoa
Never felt this good
Don't you worry, oh oh oh
Never felt this good
Don't you worry
I'm feeling like I should, ooh whoa
Never felt this good
Don't you worry, oh oh oh
Never felt this good, don't you worry
I'm feeling like I should, ooh whoa
Never felt this good
Don't you worry, oh oh oh
