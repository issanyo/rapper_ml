[intro]
Chris Porter. Mr. Worldwide
We want all the sexy women on the dancefloor shaking their
Now here's the water dance

[verse 1: Chris Porter]
Funky, funky, everything funky
Big gal, turn around, show me your donkey
Oh my lord, that's a whole lot of chunky
I can tell you from a whole 'nother country

I am a drug so I know a whole lot of junkies
In the club chillin' with a whole lot of drunkies
Plenty fun, when it comes to girls I know plenty them
Fat ones, skinny ones, all over twenty one

(WOO)
We got the dusse drippin'
She looking at me like "you stay trippin'"
Dolce & Gabbana bag, got a young Madonna here
She gon' twerk her body 'til her body need obamacare

Do it for the vine. Do it for the gram
Do it for the couple hundred dollars in my hand
No discrimination if ya heavy in the middle
Or you only got a little, go ahead and make it jiggle

[bridge]
(GO)
Ain't no party like an east coast party
With a west coast chick that got a down south body
And she bounce that body. Bounce, bounce that body
Bounce that body. Bounce, bounce that body

[Chorus]
Do the water dance, girl, do the water dance
Do the water dance, girl, do the water dance
From Miami to the bay to the port of France
Back to Jersey baby, go and do the water dance
Do the water dance, girl, do the water dance
Do the water dance, girl, do the water dance
From Miami to the bay to the port of France
Back to Jersey baby, go and do the water dance

[verse 2: Pitbull]
(WEEEEEEEEEEEEEHOO)
I'm more like a gyno. No I'm not a doctor
I don't gotta talk it, I just gotta walk it
Them boys get to hatin'. Women get to stalkin'
Yeah they rap, but they ain't saying nothin'
I'm rippin' and dipping, slipping my dick in the chicken
Having threesomes with threesome's 33 call it pippen
Why you 33 years old, still talking 'bout pimpin'?
I'm 34 making 'bout 100 million or more!

(hahahaha)
Use to move perico, now these people know it's chico
Like the beatles went from pipes to needles to G4 flights con los amigos
Now we're drinking voli vodka con el vino
Met her in the mile high club - y se vino!

I ride for the people
Die for the people
Bang for the people
Rep for the people
Man I'm the people's champ

Dale loca, shake that
Go ahead and do the water dance 'darlin!

Ain't no party like an east coast party

And she bounce that body. Bounce, bounce that body
Bounce that body. Bounce, bounce that body

[Chorus]
Do the water dance, girl, do the water dance
Do the water dance, girl, do the water dance
From Miami to the bay to the port of France
Back to Jersey baby, go and do the water dance
Do the water dance, girl, do the water dance
Do the water dance, girl, do the water dance
From Miami to the bay to the port of France
Back to Jersey baby, go and do the water dance

[verse 3: Chris Porter]
(WOOOO)
Girl dem a freaka
And she move her booty like her name is Niesha
Got me thinking 'bout it 7 days of the weeka
First she dip low the she dip down deeper, she got me like WOOOO!

Girl dem a freaka
And she move her booty like her name is Niesha
Got me thinking 'bout it 7 days of the weeka
If you can't do it then my girl goin' teach ya'!

(Ahhhh)

Ha-ha-ha, are you twerking or nah?
Ha-ha-ha-ha, are you twerking or nah?
Ha-ha-ha-ha, are you twerking or nah?
Look back at it like you reversing the car

(HEEEEY) Give it to me
(HEEEEY) Break it down
(HEEEEY) Bring it back
(HEEEEY) Swing it round
(HEEEEY) Give it to me
(HEEEEY) Break it down
(HEEEEY) Bring it back
(HEEEEY) Swing it round
