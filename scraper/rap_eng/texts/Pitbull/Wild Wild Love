[Chorus: Lauren Bennett & G.R.L.]
Oh oh, this wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
This wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
For better or worse, a blessing or a curse
Long live this wild, wild love of ours
Long live this wild, wild love

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Ladies and gentlemen
You're looking at the new playboy (Who you?)
That's right, Armando Christian Perez
And when it comes to that pretty little bitty kitty
Donâ€™t stop, get it, get it, baby, let me pet it
I got that wild love
Love to get wild, dirty, freaky, nasty, yeah, I said it
I'll make you lose your heart and your mind at the same time
Don't believe me, bet it
I'm obsessed with that wild love for sure
Even though it's a catch 22
It's a gift and curse for sure
But baby, you know that you love it too

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
That's why you need it, you want it all over your body
This loving I'm giving, it's worth more than money
You need it, you want it all over your body
I know that you want this wild, wild, love

[Chorus: G.R.L. & Emmalyn Estrada]
Oh oh, this wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
This wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
For better or worse, a blessing or a curse
Long live this wild, wild love of ours
For better or worse, a blessing or a curse
Long live this wild, wild love of ours

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Not only am I a client, I'm the player president
The globe is my backyard, babe, it's evident
When it comes to Miami, I always represent
Read all about it, ladies and gents
I'm the chico for the game
I like my women yang, I like my women yang
I like my women fine, I like them off the chain
Take 'em all the world cup, Brazil tudo bang
You know I'll meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em
Treat 'em, always keep them feeling right
I don't know if I can handle all five
But baby, we can try tonight, dale

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull & G.R.L.]
That's why you need it, you want it all over your body
This loving I'm giving, it's worth more than money
You need it, you want it all over your body
I know that you want this wild, wild, love

[Chorus: G.R.L.]
Oh oh, this wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
This wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
For better or worse, a blessing or a curse
Long live this wild, wild love of ours
Oh oh, this wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
This wild, wild love of ours, it can't be tamed, no
For better or worse, a blessing or a curse
Long live this wild, wild love of ours

[Outro: Pitbull & G.R.L. & (Lauren Bennett)]
Mr. Worldwide, G.R.L
What better than five beautiful women, haha
Long live this wild, wild love (of ours)
