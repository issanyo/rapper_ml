Imma kill 'em in the club with this one
Imma tear the club the fuck up
Imma have 'em goin' to war over this one
Partna, just listen

If you don't want those things to click-clack
Take a few steps back
Because I'm playin' for keeps, go ahead keep playin' with me
And watch how I hit 'em in the head once again

For those who didn't believe in the kid
Y'all might as well be dead
Because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did
I'm like Ray Charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all

I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap, and I'm outrunnin' y'all
When I hit 'em from the back
I got them mamis saying dammit man
When I put it in they mouth

I got them mamis saying duh-huh-huh-muhh (Time out, woo!)
When I hit 'em from the back
I got them mamis saying dammit man
When I put it in they mouth

I got them mamis saying duh-huh-huh-muhh
Put that up dammit
But me and you both know that these niggas ain't ready
They're just too petty, I'm just too deadly (Woo!)

When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)

Pitbull's that underrated, underdog, killin' the underground
But that's just an understatement
It's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid
Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain, dammit man

But I don't plan it man, because I do what I wanna do, move what I wanna move
Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams
Imma tell you like Biggie told me, cash rules everything around me
I could give a fuck about what you say about me
'Cause when those things get pulled out and squeezed, they'll spray about three

Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, that's how it goes
Pit's gon' spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro (Time out, woo!)
Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, that's how it goes
Pit's gon' spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro
So all y'all amateur ass niggas do-don't try to sit home
Pit's co-co-comin', runnin' gunnin' fo-for that throne

When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
When you see them boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)
