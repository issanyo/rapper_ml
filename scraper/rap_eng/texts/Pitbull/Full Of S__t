I know you full of shit

[Chorus: x8]
Your so full of shit

Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear
And only half what you see
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
(let me tell you what I think about there boys out here in the state they call the game)
Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see, ya heard me

I'm sick of these rappers slash actors pa pa playing a part
All they talk about is they money
And ch ch chosin' cars
So put pha pha Phantoms and Bentleys'?
And how they squeeze to listen getting high
They move it hooray
Another dope boy wannabe
All in the club talking back
Wha' wha' what what they got
Pull out the club on 26's
Go str-straight to they momma's house
Like southern Cali they hardly ever make it rain to drizzle
That's why I do them so opposite of these nizzle for shizzles

Ah tell 'em

[Chorus: x8]
Believe none of what your hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what your hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what your hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what your hear
And only half of what you see
Ya heard me

The boy knows his alphabet so now he think he a G
He run a little pot so he think he a thug
Bu bu but all eyes on me
They used to wanna be like mike
Now they just wannabe on the mic
They cut fucked up deals with music
And even if they got 25 to life
They'll be singing like Whitney
Before before she met bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowing they green like wasabi
They'll be singing like Whitney
Before before she met bobby
These boys think think they hard
Knowing they green like wasabi

Now tell um

[Chorus: x8]
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see

Ya heard me

These boys right now they got a house full of cars
A bank account full of money
They act like they on full
But check this out fool
I know your full of shit

[Chorus: x8]
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
Believe none of what you hear
And only half of what you see
