[Chorus: Heymous Molly]
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
In Little Havana
We be eatin' tore up from the floor up, gettin' hammered
Can you go down, down, baby, "Country Grammar"
Sorry Miss Thang, pardon my grammar
But I got gifts and hoes, call me Santa

[Pre-Chorus: Heymous Molly]
We don't need no holiday
No we don't
We ain't even on Spring break
'Cause I know
We can make our own va-cay
And I can show you how we do it

[Chorus: Heymous Molly]
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Yeah, we like to party
And like to fuck to "Drunk In Love", Beyoncé
Do ya thang, who cares what they all say?
Put your lips like a ring around my Woo!
Now that's a fian-stay
Now just do what the song say, dalé!

[Pre-Chorus: Heymous Molly]
We don't need no holiday
No we don't
We ain't even on Spring break
'Cause I know
We can make our own va-cay
And I can show you how we do it

[Chorus: Heymous Molly]
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers

[Bridge: Heymous Molly & Pitbull]
To the left, to the right
To never waiting for the night
To the left, to the right
To never waiting for the night
To the left, to the right
To never waiting for the night
To the left, to the right
To never waiting for the night

[Chorus: Heymous Molly]
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
Day drinking
Sun goes up and drink goes down
Gonna pass another round
To you and me and all these crazy muthafuckers
