[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
It's my time, It's my life, I can do what I like
For the price of a smile
I got a ticket to ride
So I keep living, because it feels right
And it's so nice
And I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know, never stop
Give me more, more, more
Because I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias]
Show me love, make us one
Let's make a beautiful world
Take my hand, it's alright
Because tonight we can fly

So we keep living, because it feels right
And it's so nice, and I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know, never stop
Give me more, more, more
Because I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
What you consider the best
I consider mediocre
I want my bank account like Carlos Slims
Or at least mini-Oprah
Baby, just close your eyes
And imagine any part in the world
I've been there
I'm like global warming
Anything I just start to heat the things up
But I've been here
Time traveler, through time zones
Give me some of my vodka any zone
Enrique Iglesias, and translation
Enrique Churches, confession
Dale mamita, dimelo todo
Alante tu hombre, yo me hago el bobo
No te preocupes, baby for real
Because you going to like how it feels

Because I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

[Outro: Enrique Iglesias]
I like how it feels
I like how it feels
