[Intro: Pitbull]
Keith Urban! Mr. Worldwide!
They say life is short
So I'ma live it up
Tonight it's goin' down
'Til the Sun comes up, dale

[Verse 1: Keith Urban]
2 a.m. and I'm about to lose my mind
The way she's movin' that black dress like her hips are on fire
Deer in the headlights, dancin' like she's in a movie scene
To die for, and it's killin' me

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
Stars are out
But they're fadin' fast, gotta make it last
And I'm so close to heaven
But just hold tonight, cause I need the light

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
Sun don't let me down
She's almost in my arms right now
I know you gotta rise for the birds to sing
But I need the moonlight to do my thing
Sun don't let me down
Sun don't let me down
Don't let me down
Sun don't let me down

[Verse 2: Keith Urban]
Hey don't get me wrong, I like the way you shine
I know you love kissin' on her skin, but it's my turn tonight
Starin' at her lips, playin' with my name
Whisperin', callin' me, she's pullin' me in
Like I'm on a chain

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Urban]
Stars are out
Yeah they're in the sky, like they're in her eyes
I think I found my heaven
But just have a heart, stay where you are

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
Sun don't let me down
She's almost in my arms right now
I know you gotta rise for the birds to sing
But I need the moonlight to do my thing
Sun don't let me down
Sun don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
(Sun don't let me down)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Life is short so I'm livin' it up
Tonight it's goin' down, yeah, 'til the Sun comes up
Then we do it all again cause we ain't givin' a what!
And all the women in the party givin' it up
Time is money and I ain't wastin' no time
So fill my cup with Voli, water and lime
Takin' shots for the soldiers in the field
Thanks for the freedom, and that's for real
Tonight we're gettin' hammered, bang up a tank
That means get off the chain, let loose and drink
Mami wanna play the adult version of truth or dare
So I took her to the back and pulled her hair, yeah

[Chorus: Keith Urban]
Sun don't let me down
She's almost in my arms right now
I know you gotta rise for the birds to sing
But I need the moonlight to do my thing
Sun don't let me down
(Sun don't let me down)
She's almost in my arms right now
(In my arms right now)
I know you gotta rise for the birds to sing
But I need the moonlight to do my thing
Sun don't let me down
Sun don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
(Sun don't, sun don't)
Don't come around
Stay underground
Don't let me down
Sun don't let me down
