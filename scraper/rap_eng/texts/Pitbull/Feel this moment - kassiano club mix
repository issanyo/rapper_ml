Ask for money, and get it viced
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the Dirty, but that chico nice
Ya'll call it a moment, I call it life

Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)
I just wanna feel this moment

Mr Worldwide
Christina Aguilera
Oye mamita, come on, dale
Que la cosa esta rica

(I wanna feel this moment)

(Feel this moment...)

Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from the hard ways
Bill sos, and oh yeas
They count it always, 305 all day
Now baby we can party, oh baby we can party
She read books, especially about red rooms and tight ups
I got it hooked
Cause she seen me in a suit with the red ta-ta up
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya, but time is money
Only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)
I just wanna feel this moment

(Feel this moment...)

I see the future but live for the moment, make sense don't
It
Now make dollars, I mean billions, im a genius, I mean
Brilliant
This street is what scoot em
And made em slicker, to slick with the ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot
But i'm still undefeated like Zula
I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with alll my
Peeps
Baby we can travel the world
And not given view, and all you can see
Time is money
Only difference is I own it, like a stop watch
Let's stop time and enjoy this moment

Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)
I just wanna feel this moment (ohh)
I just wanna feel this moment

Come one, feel this moment...

Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Oh, I just wanna feel this moment
