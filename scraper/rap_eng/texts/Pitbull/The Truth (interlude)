Being overlooked, being slept on
Being started but I just keep going
Being up, being down
Payed dues, earned stripes
Been in lawsuits, welcome to my life

I'm too Latin for hip hop
And too hip hop for Latin
So you all figure it out I'ma keep rappin'
But that's okay
'Cause I'ma be on the top one day

Con pasiensia y vaselina
El elefante se la metio a la ormiga
And that's the slogan I live by
Me, I just hang in the hood
Y'all just drive by
Lights out, lights out like a drive by

My life is real
I ain't got nothing to lie about
You can ask anyone that's with me
How this lil' chico right here
Took over the city

Luke, trick they were the start
But that lil' chico Pitbull, he was the spot
Now this nigga's picking up rappers
Like they know what's up

Two at a time, nigga
Who would have thought
The bottom on top
Today's lil rappers not to take it to heart

If you can't finish don't start
Hey, if you can't finish don't start
Hey, if you can't finish don't start, rah
