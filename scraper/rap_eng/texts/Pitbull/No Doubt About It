[Intro: Pitbull (Jussie Smollett)]
(Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it)
Mister Worldwide
(Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it)
Reporting live from the Empire
Jamal let’s show them how to get off the chain
Off the glass, off the flip, off the rip, let’s ride

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
All we want is a party
Have some shots with somebody
Take the music and turn it all the way up
If you came here to party
And ain’t no doubt about it
Say no doubt about it
Say ain’t no doubt about it
Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it, hey, hey
Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it oh, oh
Ain't no doubt about it, hey
Ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Come over to the party, come over to the party
Who they gonna see? Who they gonna see?
It's P-I-T and your boy Jamal, and we off the heezy
Everybody say hey oh, alright, everybody say hey oh, alright
Baby if you ain’t on the dance floor
Then baby what you got all that ass for?
Let me show you how we do it
Show her to the club where the bad ones do it
Line up the shots, throw it back, do it
Light it, throw it in the air, do it
You wanna take it off, baby, do it
In this party ain’t no social media
No camera phones, so let’s get it on
You can do what you wanna do
And do who you wanna do
Be what you wanna be
Freak who you wanna freak
Beep beep who got the keys to the suite?
Vroom, skeet, skeet
Ella dice que no asta enamorada de mi
Pero la gusta como yo lo doy
Mami esta noche fiesta
Mañana puedes ser honesta
Dale

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t mean no harm
Please forgive me if I’m causing you alarm
But the DJ, he just played my favorite song
And you look like you’re ready, so come on
Baby come on, hey

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
All we want is a party
Have some shots with somebody
Take the music and turn it all the way up
If you came here to party
And ain’t no doubt about it
Sing no doubt about it
Say ain’t no doubt about it
Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it, hey, hey
Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it oh, oh
Ain't no doubt about it, hey
Ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it

[Verse 2: Jussie Smollett]
Ain't nothing more important to me right now
Than this shot of Tequila
I've earned the right  to just not give a damn
About a damn thing but throwing my hands up
I want it all night, all night with you
You and your friends
And we gonna watch the sunrise
If it's alright with you
And then we'll do it all again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t mean no harm
Please forgive me if I’m causing you alarm
But the DJ, he just played my favorite song
And you look like you’re ready, so come on
Baby come on, hey

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
All we want is a party
Have some shots with somebody
Take the music and turn it all the way up
If you came here to party
And ain’t no doubt about it
Sing no doubt about it
Say ain’t no doubt about it
Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it, hey, hey
Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it oh, oh
Ain't no doubt about it, hey
Ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it

[Bridge: Jussie Smollett]
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
But having me a real, real good time
I ain't got a damn thing on my mind
But having a good time
(I ain't got a damn thing on my mind)

[Chorus: Jussie Smollett]
All we want is a party
Have some shots with somebody
Take the music and turn it all the way up
If you came here to party
And ain’t no doubt about it
Sing no doubt about it
Say ain’t no doubt about it
Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it, hey, hey
Ain't no, no, no, no doubt about it oh, oh
Ain't no doubt about it, hey
Ain't no doubt about it
There ain't no doubt about it
