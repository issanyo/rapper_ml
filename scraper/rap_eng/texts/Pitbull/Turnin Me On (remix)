Have you ever seen someone
That you thought was so sexy
And even though you had a man
He was still turnin' you on

Move the feelin' right
And I see you standin' there
Not an ordinary night
Feeling lust is in the air (hey)
Way your body looks
Its turnin' me on
They way you lick your lips slow
Makes me want you even more

[Chorus]
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on
If so attracted
Could this be wrong
To feel this way
And come on so strong
Won't take my time
Cause u might be gone
Don't know your name
But your turnin' me on
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Your turnin' me on

All alone tonight
And I left my man at home
I can't
Get you out my site
I know
This feeling is so wrong (hey)
I wanna approach you
Let you know how I feel
Wanna do more to
Try to seal this deal

[Chorus]
End of the night
Can I
Wait for you outside
We can
End this evening right
We can
Kick it on the side
I need to experience
What you can do
We'll have a private party
For just me and you

[Chorus]
First time I ever been so
Attracted to a stranger
Don't know if this is wrong but
Don't mind if in a danger
You caught my eye
Minute that I saw you
Knowin' that a may wanna get to know you
Can I get your name
Makin' me say (your turnin' me on)

Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey

[Chorus]
