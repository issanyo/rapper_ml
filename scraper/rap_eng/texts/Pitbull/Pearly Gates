[Intro: Nayer & (Pitbull)]
Baby Your All That I Want
(I don't believe in religion, I believe in god and baby you my heaven)
Baby you're all that I want
When you lying here in my arms
I'm Finding it hard to believe were in heaven
(She's my lady, my baby, my women and!)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
She's hot as hell yeah, but she's my heaven
She is my Eve, I'm her apple for example
We got that simple passion
We got that hot lust
We got that one in a million love
All of the above, let them talk they envy
I love them text's you send me, with a pic attached
Your girlfriend she friendly
You like a quarterback, your going down in the sack
Our love is never ending
That's why they hate like that

[Hook: Nayer]
Baby you're all that I want
When Your lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe, were in heaven
And loving is all that I need
And it found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
(She's my lady my baby my women and!)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
She's there thick and thin
She's there rain or fall
She's there whether I lose or win whether I rise or fall
She's with me whether we live, life is beyond poverty
She loves me for me
Armando Pern√£ Mr 3-05, that's right
This life can be deceitful
In my career attracts
All the wrong people
If you find a keeper
Then you better keep her
I always put her first
Her love is heaven on earth

[Hook: Nayer]


[Outro: Nayer]
Ooo-hooah-oo-ooo [x3]
Were in heaven
Baby your all that I want
When your lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven
Loving is all I need
And it found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven
