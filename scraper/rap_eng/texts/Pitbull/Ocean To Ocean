[Intro: Pitbull]
They tried to get rid of me
But from ocean to ocean
They gon' have to deal with me

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I been overlooked, slept on
Stepped on, left for dead
Always against all odds like Pac said
I'm the living Great Gatsby
But these boys are watching quick and disappear like Banksy
From ocean to ocean, sea to sea
I'm something that you gotta see

[Chorus: Rhea]
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I practice what I preach, but I ain't gon' lie
I still got love for these streets, 305 till I die
Still got love for these beats, that's why I spit this fire
You can catch me on a beat, 'specially on a island
Took over my city, now it's time for the world
I live a day rapping, there's a difference girl
Getting paid more than athletes, man, life is sweet
GM on the status, papo, watch me, woo

[Chorus: Rhea]
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Woo)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I got the world on my shoulder, still quick on my feet
Nas say sleep is the cousin of death so I don't sleep
These boys act like they hard but we know that they sweet
They wouldn't bust a grape at a food fight, papo, please
Went from rapping with them boys with a mouth full of gold
To hanging with Slim Jr., down in Mexico
Take it with a grain of salt, and a, pound of gold
The game is to be sold, and not told, let's go

[Chorus: Rhea]
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains)
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
