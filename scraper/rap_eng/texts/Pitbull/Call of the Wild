She was a stunner, this woman was just amazing
But baby don't play me & tell me that you don't like to get crazy
Your mind says no, but you're body says yes
'N I'm gonna give you what your body wants and leave you fully in bliss
I am the man who can for real
Make you feel like a woman should & baby I will
Let's ride & I will show you the night
What it is to feel right & I was like

Let me guess your not the freaky type
& you don't get down on the first night
But I promise I'll make you feel so right
Come on baby there's a first time for everything. (Now say it)

Now she said she ready

Nice slow & steady
Then I'm gon' give it to you however you ask for it
I'll catch it, you throw it & baby you know it "You Know It"
I'm certified "Certified"
Around the globe
I mark my territory wherever I go
Baby don't think twice, let's ride tonight
I promise a good time & now it's like

Let me guess you're not the freaky type
& you don't get down on the first night
But I promise I'll make you feel so right
Come on baby there's a first time for everything. (Now say it)
