[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Now, first of all, come on, baby
Take it off, come on, baby
Break me off
Then she said she love the fact that Pitbull such a dog
It's simple, baby, I ain't picky
Only rule of mine is no hickeys
Remember, lust can get tricky
It's Mr. Worldwide and Ricky
Dale

[Pre-Chorus: Ricky Martin]
No, I'm not tryna get in your head
And I'm not tryna push your limits
Cause I just wanna make you feel special
A little love, little fun, little dancing

[Chorus: Ricky Martin]
Who has a lifetime, baby?
We got the night right now
When you see what I'm planning
You're gonna call me Mr. Put It Down

[Post-Chorus: Pitbull] (x2)
Baby, gimme that, gimme that uh
I'll give you that, give you that ah
Baby, gimme that, gimme that uh
I'll give you that, give you that ah

[Verse 2: Ricky Martin]
Baby, I can recognize from miles away
That you don't wanna be alone
But ain't nobody looking like you do tonight
So tell me how to turn you on

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus] + [Post-Chorus] (x2)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
It's the P to the I-I to the T-T to the B-B to the U, double the L
I'm so hot, I'm hotter than hell
Baby, turn around for Mr. Put It Down
Went from the block to the yacht to the G4
Down in D.R. jet took a detour
Not from Maryland but when it comes to women
There can always be more
Get it? B-more
2Pac? No, but I get around
Baby, nice to meet you
I'm Mr. Put It Down

[Bridge: Ricky Martin]
Hola, oh my
Where did you come from
Oh, I know how to pick the right one
I got my spot, girl
So while the night's young
Just follow me

[Chorus] + [Post-Chorus] (x2)
