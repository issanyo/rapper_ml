[Intro: Pitbull]
Now we gon' take it from Miami, the pineapple
To New York, the big apple
Now let's escape, dale!

[Chorus: Theron Theron]
Party jumpin', until the morning
Feeling free, free, free
Hands keep waving, we misbehavin'
Feeling free, free, free
Cause ain't nobody ready to go home
We gon' keep it going all night long
Yeah, party raisin', so hard time crazy
Feeling free, free, free

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Guess who's back fresh off the boat
Smelling like Bahamas for sure
I still got the ship, escape
Still the Godfather
Still el Padrino, you know
After dark, it gets a little loose
A lotta voli 3-0-5, no goose
Straight water, straight lime, no juice
Catch me on top of that ya, (heh) no roof
Travel 'round the world like it's a new sport
Move and escape to New York
Ahora ven aqui mami, dame un beso
Tu sabe que te gusta, deja eso

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Tonight, tonight
We gon' have us a real good time
Baby girl, how you so fine?
Tonight you gon' be mine (be mine)
Tonight, tonight
We gon' have us a real good time (good time)
Baby girl, how you so fine? (so fine)
Tonight you gon' be mine (that's right)

[Chorus: Theron Theron]
Party jumpin', until the morning
Feeling free, free, free
Hands keep waving, we misbehavin'
Feeling free, free, free
Cause ain't nobody ready to go home
We gon' keep it going all night long
Yeah, party raisin', so hard time crazy
Feeling free, free, free

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Wooo
Guess who's back, Yours truly
Mr. Independent, welcome to the new me
Nothing like freedom I'd love to be free
A world takeover, times three
Hardest working man in the game, that's me
He's done, he's over, he's finished, let's see (yeah right)
You clearly don't know me
Mami wanna have some fun, mami show me
Mami wanna party, I poured her some Voli
She said I remember you at (waze?), I said that's the old me
Ahora dame un beso
Tu sabe que te gusta, deja eso

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Tonight, tonight
We gon' have us a real good time
Baby girl, how you so fine?
Tonight you gon' be mine (be mine)
Tonight, tonight
We gon' have us a real good time (good time)
Baby girl, how you so fine? (so fine)
Tonight you gon' be mine (that's right)


[Chorus: Theron Theron]
Party jumpin', until the morning
Feeling free, free, free
Hands keep waving, we misbehavin'
Feeling free, free, free
Cause ain't nobody ready to go home
We gon' keep it going all night long
Yeah, party raisin', so hard time crazy
Feeling free, free, free

[Hook: Theron Theron]
Go like limbo, take me down low (down low)
Party tempo, to the congo
We've been drinkin', making right decisions
There's no limit, everybody's singing

[Chorus: Theron Theron]
Party jumpin', until the morning
Feeling free, free, free
Hands keep waving, we misbehavin'
Feeling free, free, free
Cause ain't nobody ready to go home
We gon' keep it going all night long
Yeah, party raisin', so hard time crazy
Feeling free, free, free
