[Intro: Enrique Iglesias + (Pitbull)]
One love, one love
(Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull
Y'all know what time it is
We go set it off tonight, just go
Set the club on fire, just go
Enrique, holla at them like)

[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
Girl please excuse me if I'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night we can really let go
My girlfriend's out of town and I'm all alone
Your boyfriend is on vacation and he doesn't have to know

[Pre-Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do the things I'm gonna wanna do to you
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screaming loud, let me hear you go

[Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I-I-I like it

[Lionel Richie]
Party, Karamu, Fiesta, Forever

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias]
Girl please excuse me if I'm misbehaving, oh
I'm trying keep my hands off, but you're begging me for more
Round round round, give a low low low
Let the time time pass cause we're never getting old

[Pre-Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do it better turn around I'll give you more
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screaming loud
Let me hear you go!

[Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it

Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Go DJ, that's my DJ
I'm a Miami Boy, you know how we play
I'm ain't playing with you, but I wanna play with you
Give me got me good, now watch me
It's a different species, get me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn
Tiger Woods times Jesse James
Equals Pitbull all night long
Pick up Barack and Michelle and let them that it's on
Pa' fuera, pa' la calle
Dale mamita tirame ese baile
Dale mamita tirame ese baile
I see you watching me, you see me watching you
I love the way you move, I like them things you do
Like

[Bridge: Enrique Iglesias]
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop baby, won't stop baby
Until you get enough

Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it

The way you move on the floor

Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
