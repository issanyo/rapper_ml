[Intro]
Dougie F
Mr. Worldwide
Every action has a reaction

[Verse 1: Dougie F]
I know we ain't seein' eye to eye, it just ain't workin'
You say you can't take no more, I know that we ain't perfect
I was tryna fix us up, you was up late night thirstin'
Goin' back and forth with you, nah, it ain't workin'

[Hook: Dougie F]
Left my phone unlocked that night, I did that shit on purpose
I ain't come back home last night, I did that shit on purpose
Hit the club and got fucked up, I did that shit on purpose
Hotel with two hoes that tell, I did that shit on purpose
Yeah, yeah, on purpose
Yeah, did that shit on purpose
Yeah, did that shit on purpose

[Verse 2: Dougie F]
Too much drink inside my cup, this can't be for one person
Too much weed inside my dutch, right now I'm high, I'm floatin'
Forgettin' all the times we had, our ups and downs, on purpose
I hope that you cry right now and no, no, I ain't jokin'
Why you play them games? I don't know, I do not know why
Scared if I ask you to tell the truth, you would sit there and tell a lie
I'm done up with all of your bullshit, I ain't gon' hold you back, go and fly
I'm doin' what I want, fuckin' who I want and I don't know why

[Hook: Dougie F]
Left my phone unlocked that night, I did that shit on purpose
I ain't come back home last night, I did that shit on purpose
Hit the club and got fucked up, I did that shit on purpose
Hotel with two hoes that tell, I did that shit on purpose
Yeah, yeah, on purpose
Yeah, did that shit on purpose
Yeah, did that shit on purpose

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Tight white dress, no thong
Girl I see you did that on purpose
With that look in your eye
I can see that you wanna be a bad girl on purpose
The way you back it up
I can see that you wanna get hit from the back on purpose
I know you want me to cum inside that box
Don't you, baby? On purpose
I've dealt with drug dealers and guerrillas
And gold diggers, why you hangin' with a gang of killers?
I'm in 'em all, peace on the own island
With a gang of girls in the gang of villas
It's the 8 figure chico that you thought would never blow
On my way to be a 9 figure chico, plus I just wanna know
And you think this luck?
You dumb fuck, bitch we did

[Hook: Dougie F]
Left my phone unlocked that night, I did that shit on purpose
I ain't come back home last night, I did that shit on purpose
Hit the club and got fucked up, I did that shit on purpose
Hotel with two hoes that tell, I did that shit on purpose
Yeah, yeah, on purpose
Yeah, did that shit on purpose
Yeah, did that shit on purpose

[Outro: Dougie F]
Purpose
Did that shit on purpose
Did that shit on purpose
