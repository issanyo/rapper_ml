Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em

[Verse 1: Havana Brown]
When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy are you afraid of the dark, dark
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me do you know where to start, start
And when the base gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel a part, part
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound, sound
Well the sound is the key to my heart, heart

[Hook: Havana Brown]
We run, yes uh

Run 'em like, run 'em run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em run 'em, woop!

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
From the bottom of the map, Miami
To the land down under, Australia
You feel my drive, see my vision and hear my hunger
(My hunger)
As my money gets older, let's get younger
They sell their soul but the devil knows I have no number
I'm go go baby, fresh oh baby, go go baby, uh oh baby, no no baby
Yeah baby, now jiggle it baby, let me tickle it baby
I know I'm lost it's go'n' be hard to save me
I'm sorry, that's how Dade county raised me
Y'all heard me right we run the night
Now fuck you pay me!

[Hook: Havana Brown]
We run, yes uh
We run the night night night
We run, yes uh
We run the night
Night night
(we run we run run)
We run, yes uh
We run the night the night, night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em,woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

[Verse 3: Havana Brown]
Feel the life go rush, rush, rush
Pushing past me, all over my skin, skin
I can get enough 'nough 'nough 'nough
Cause the beat keep pullin' me in
Takin' me so high up, up, up
Place that I've never been, ahhhh
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day then do it again, 'gain

[Hook: Havana Brown]
We run, yes uh
We run the night night night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, whoop!
We run, yes uh
We run the night
(we run, we run run)
We run, yes uh
We run the night, the night
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em
Woop!
