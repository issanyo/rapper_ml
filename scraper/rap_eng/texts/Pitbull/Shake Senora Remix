Once catch or die, Catch me in Cuba!
Senorita, sh-sh-sh-shake it
Que la dejo mojadita like the great lakes
Mal hablado y fresco Dame duro mamita, dame lento

Luda!
Hey mamacita, tu es muy bonita
Hotter than lava, shake it like two maracas
Bend down and touch your toes
Then hop inside this custom rolls
Two shots of tequila, manos pa' arriba
Now bring it back
Bring it till you put
It right inside my lap
Make it clap, drop it low
The mamies call me papa dough
Too much dough, too much cash
I can't think straight with all this ass
I gotta lighten up like Sammy Sosa
And live La Vida Loca!
