[Verse 1: Danity Kane]
Show stoppin' at the latest spot
The ride shinin' with the open top
Hydraulics make our heads go nod
Hair blowin' in the breeze, yo we superstars
Put in the keys, make that engine purr
3 in the back, one in the passenger
Slow creepin', cause we look that fly
All the boys tryin' taste our candy ride

[Pre-Chorus: Danity Kane]
We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah

[Chorus: Danity Kane]
Bet you ain't never seen (hey)
Chicks ridin' this clean (hey)
Louis Vuitton seats (oh, oh, oh)
We do it daily
This how we keep it poppin' (hey)
Make sure that bass knockin' (hey)
So when you see us ridin' (oh, oh, oh)
We call it show stoppin'
We show stoppin'
We show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin'
We show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin' (hey)
Make sure that bass knockin' (hey)
So when you see us ridin' (oh, oh, oh)
We call it show stoppin'

[Verse 2: Danity Kane]
We sittin' on 22s plus 2
Mink bucket seats, neon blue
Color coordinate with them shoes
Yeah, we divas but we ride like big boys do
Black tinted with a white stripe interstate
Lookin' in the mirror at my Bad Boy fitted, yup
Show stoppin' 'til they lose their breath
Turn the wheel to the right, turn the wheel to the left

[Pre-Chorus: Danity Kane]
We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Yeah
Yeah baby girl, right there, it’s dope
Dig big frame and a bad girl small
When she ain’t got no ring on her finger so I guess I’ma bang her, yeah yeah
She look like a box of [?], looking so serious
She looking at me [?], I guess she’s curious
Even though she [?]
I ain’t gon’ let her put her hands on my dope
She need to see by me, it’s B.o.B, my speech go deep
And if she leave with me, then it can secretly go down

[Chorus: Danity Kane]
Bet you ain't never seen (hey)

[Verse 4: Pitbull]
I’ma show, show, show, show stop
When I walk in the club all over, so the girls go two ways, yes sir, ooh way, [?]
I’m ridin’ Kane in that big body Benz, [?], no rims
I’m on that grown man shit, I stop, they jump in
I’m from the real state, and me, I’m in the real estate
I worth about seven digits, oh yeah that’s right
Wanna educate, read a book, me I motivate, just look
I did what I have to, I did what it took, now I studied cocaine, this music I could

[Chorus: Danity Kane]
Bet you ain't never seen (hey)
