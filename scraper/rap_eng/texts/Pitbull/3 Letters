One love, one love

Move your body now

[Enrique Iglesias]
I don't care if you're taken
Long as you're single and I come around
I don't care for love making
I wanna beat it till your walls come down
I put the key in your ignition and turn you on
So you'd be revved up, ready to go
Now I can tell you what I'm thinking, if you want
But you already know, already know

I've got 3 letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you
I've got 3 letters on my brain
I can't wait to put it on you
And have you like wo-oh, make your body explode
I've got 3 letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you

I don't care what you're wearing
Because it all looks good on the floor
I wanna see you standing
With nothing on but the heels you wore
I put the key in your ignition and turn you on
So you'd be revved up, ready to go
Now I can tell you what I'm thinking, if you want
But you already know, already know

I've got 3 letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you
I've got 3 letters on my brain
I can't wait to put it on you
And have you like wo-oh, make your body explode
I've got 3 letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you

[Pitbull]
It's easy, I make it look easy
But I will call for the money, believe me
Foreplay for sure, tease me
In Español, sí sí
In French, oui oui
In English, ye, yes
I give you the best best
Dale loquita rica, now gimme a kiss kiss
Nothing better than a... and some thinking
What you expect, S-E-X
Now we can take it to the room
And explode like a boom
Take it to the ladies bathroom , like oooh
Take it to the parking lot
Back seat, beat beat, vroom vroom, make you hot
You don't do this on the first night
Let me prove you wrong
Key in your ignition
Let me turn you on
You don't do this on the first night
Ay mamita, of course you do

[Enrique Iglesias]
I'm going down, going down, going down
Cause baby you're sexy
So turn around, turn around, turn around
Cause baby you're sexy

I've got 3 letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you
I've got 3 letters on my brain
I can't wait to put it on you
And have you like wo-oh, make your body explode
I've got 3 letters on my brain
I shouldn't have to spell it for you

(Move your body now)
I've got 3 letters
(Move your body now)
I've got 3 letters
