[Hook]
Hold up, wait a minute
(Chris Flames!)
Hold up, wait a minute
(It's that little chico Pitbull, Que bola!)
Hold up, wait a minute
(Big boys out here)
Hold up, wait a minute
(Just hold up, wait a minute)
Hold up, wait a minute

[Verse 1]
You listening, witnessing
History in the making
I'm taking everything over
I've been patiently waiting
I'm hot as that boy they call Satan
Jehovah's my witness man
Contradicting, ain't it?
Buddy, that's the business man
Fuck rap, you listening to a business man
I'm making sure my kids enjoy Christmas man
I'm learning Corporate schemes
While y'all out chasing street dreams
I'm making clean man dawg
Fuck a triple-beam

[Bridge]
Hey DJ Ideal, do me a favor
You know what time it is
Bring that mother-fucking shit back!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You listening, witnessing
History in the making
I'm taking everything over
I've been patiently waiting
I'm hot as that boy they call Satan
Jehovah's my witness man
Contradicting, ain't it?
Buddy, that's the business man
Fuck rap, you listening to a business man
I'm making sure my kids enjoy Christmas man
I'm learning Corporate schemes
While y'all out chasing street dreams
I'm making clean man dawg
Fuck a triple-beam
I know blocks
That probably make more money
In one week than your town in one year
Think not (Woooo!)
But I'm done with that
Instead of cooking crack, I'm cooking rap
And its raw, that's why DJ's bring it back

[Outro]
Hold up wait a minute
These boys off the chain with it
Hold up wait a minute
These boys off the chain with it
Hold up wait a minute
These boys off the chain with it
Hold up wait a minute
These boys off the chain with it
