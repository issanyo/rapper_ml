[Intro: Pitbull and Dario G]
*Dario G Instrumental*
This is for the world, this is the globe
This is for the world, this is the globe
This is for the world, this is the globe
This is for the world, this is the globe
This is for the world, this is the globe
This is for the world (Mr. 305!)
This is the globe (Dario G!)
This is for the world (TKZee!)
This is the globe

[Hook: TKZee (Pitbull)]
We got the game on
Just come on and play with me, me, ayy
(This is for the world)
Just come on and play with me
(This is for the globe)

[Verse 1: TKZee]
Ladies poppin', fires pumpin
Sky is eclipse, sunshine and only
Kids are playing, and I hear them scream
We got the game on
Just come on and play with me, me, me
All you wanted, is the failin'
All we want, is the top of the fighting
Let them screaming, don't repeat 'em
Concentrate on your left, cause you need it
One two three, we'll be rocking the floor
Watching here you now, just to fake our zone
Get it you know, get it you know

[Hook 2: TKZee (Pitbull)]
We got the game on
Just come on and play with me
Just come on and play with me
(This is for the world)
(This is for the world)
We got the game on

[Bridge: Pitbull]
This is for the world (Better said)
This is for the glory (Mr. Worldwide)
(This is for the world)
I want everybody to unite and show the power
(This is for the glory)
Of the world, when it's together

[Verse 2: TKZee]
Sunshine, it shine on me
Every night, the stars above me
Kids are playing, and I hear them scream
We got the game on
Just come on and play with me, me, me
All you wanted, is the failin'
All we want, is the top of the fighting
Let them screaming, don't repeat 'em
Concentrate on your left, cause you need it
One two three, we'll be rocking the floor
Watching here you now, just to fake our zone
Get it you know, get it you know
We got the game on

[Hook 3: Pitbull (TKZee)]
This is for the world
This is for the glory
(We got the game on)
This is for the world
This is for the glory
This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the glory

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
This is for the world, this is for the glory
This is for the victory, come on let's take it home
This for the glory, yeah, that's for sure
They never thought that we could do it
But we did it (oh we!)
This is for my country, this is for my people
Everyone say with me, say it, dale chico!
Kick a, kick a, kick a, kick a,yeah kick, me a goal!
Goalie, goalie, goalie, goalie, you save me a goal!

[Hook 4: Pitbull (TKZee)]
This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the globe
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the globe
This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the globe
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the world
(Just come on and play with me)
This is for the globe
(We got the game on)
