[Intro: Pitbull]
She's got me like na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Mr. Worldwide
She's got that look in her eyes
Enrique Iglesias
Like she wants to mess around
Enrique, talk to 'em

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & (Pitbull)]
I heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another
You been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend, too, told you about me, too
Cause I'ma tell you straight up, I been messin' around
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
Yeah, I been messin' around

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
The way you lick your lips, yeah, I like that
When you act like a bad girl, I like that
That little sexy look you got, mmm, I like that
The way you whisper in my ear how you want it when you want it, girl, I like that
Let's go, baby, let's ride
Let's not talk about it, let's do it
How you want it, English or Spanish?
Both of them, I'm fluent
We can get freaky in the morning or in the afternoon
We can go all night long, baby, it's all up to you

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & Pitbull]
You can get sexy if you want to
And you can bring your girls if you want to
And we can hit the crib if you want to
And we can mess around if you want to
Tell me, you want to?

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & (Pitbull)]
I heard from a friend who heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another
You been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend, too, told you about me, too
Cause I'ma tell you straight up, I been messin' around
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
Yeah, I been messin' around

[Post-Chorus: Both, Pitbull]
Enrique, let's break it down right quick
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
The way you talk dirty, yeah, I like that
The way you bring other girls, yeah, I like that
The way you rock them heels, yeah, I like that
No thong up under that skirt, ooh, I like that
And you can get crazy, yeah, that's cool
You can get loose, yeah, that's cool
You got some Voli, yeah, that's cool
Let's jump on the bar, yeah, that's cool
Let's push the gas, I'm like ooh
I don't mean to be rude, but I swear to God
There's so many things that I'd love to do to you

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & Pitbull]
You can get it sexy if you want to
And you can bring your girls if you want
And we can hit the crib if you want to
And we can mess around if you want to
Tell me, you want to?

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & (Pitbull)]
I heard from a friend who heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another that you been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend, too, told you about me, too
Cause I'ma tell you straight up, I been messin' around
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
Yeah, I been messin' around

[Post-Chorus: Both, Pitbull]
Enrique, let's break it down right quick

I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
Let's mess around
