[Intro: Pitbull and Cris Cab]
When it comes to girls, they say
If you run down, you can only get one
But if you walk down you can get 'em all
Imagine if you crawl, ha ha
All of the girls say, oooh ooh ooh oh
It's Mister W.W oooh ooh ooh oh
Putting it down with Cris Cab oooh ooh ooh oh
Double C, talk to 'em

[Verse 1: Cris Cab]
There's something about Tina
She turns up my day
One day I dream of
She's my Mona Lisa
Caroline and Katharine
They take my blues away
There's Ronda she's fun but
She calls me every day

[Bridge 1: Cris Cab]
I can see her by my side
She's got everything I like
The way she says my name
Always starts the flame
There's just something in her eyes
Like the stars when they align
From all around the world
I can hear her, all of the girls

[Hook: Cris Cab]
All of these girls
They got me falling over and
They're so beautiful
The way they move their shoulders and
All of these girls
They know just what they like
And they'll keep you up all night
So you better get it right
When the girls say

[Bridge 2: Cris Cab]
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Oooh ooh ooh oh (When the girls say)
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Oooh ooh ooh oh (All of these girls)
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Oooh ooh ooh oh (So beautiful)
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Oooh ooh ooh oh

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
She got that supercalifragilistic bootylicous booty
Could it be Trudy, or could it be Judy
Could it be Lula or could it be Sullie
It really doesn't matter 'cause they're all yours truly
Girls, girls, everywhere
When they walk by I stop and stare, man
I love them girls, girls, everywhere
The ones that keep with heel game, nails and hair
Nice to meet ya, como va la cosa
Me, I replace 'em or chase 'em like mimosas
One gets married
The other one, traer la otra
Looking for a gift, ha, mamita call Oprah
I see the way you dance
She was looking for romance
She looking for a good time
You looking for some action
Baby act right, and I can change your life in one night
Just imagine

[Hook: Cris Cab]
All of these girls
They got me falling over and
They're so beautiful
The way they move their shoulders and
All of these girls
They know just what they like
And they'll keep you up all night
So you better get it right
When the girls say

[Bridge 2: Cris Cab]
