Aqui llego el locito que dice olbidate del VIP
Aqui llego el locito que dice mami ponme lo hay que te la voy a partir
Asi asi asi dale, aqui llegaron los animales
Con permico mai dale, dale por er pico mami dale
Esto es lo que pasa en la discoteqa
Cuando estoy tomado y se me para la escopeta
Estoy fuera de control, ben paca ben paca ben paca mi amor
Tengo la carne y tengo el sason
Y podemos jugar pero no dejes el chupon
Mami ten cuidado
Como los homres en la carse que se les caen el javon

*Verse 2 (D-Roc)*

That little momma is known around the world
Shake that ass if u a nasty girl
Back that ass up says juvenile
Show a nigga some tities like girls gone wild
Tear off this clip of clothes, i wanna see u in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road
Where niggas go to see naked hoes
Shake that shit bitch
And be off in the club with a hard ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit
Put a hump in your back
And lick it raw
To a 3 point stance
But u mess up yo ass
You must be on that kanye work out plan
Like head shoulder knees hoes

*Chorus*

Shake shake just shake shake
Just shake shake
Just shake chica shake shake
Shake shake just shake shake
Just shake shake
Just shake chica shake shake

*Verse 3 (Kaine)*

Take em out in cruise
Take em out all dressed
Is the realest true niggas in the ATL
Yeah we break it down betta shake a booty hoe
And them hoes and the girl with the real tight clothes
One time for the gang with the ying yang twins
We already know we off the reel
Dont tolerate that talkin
Bitch u can make the walkin
Patrollers is where im groaking
The only way that we are talkin
If your breath smells like mine
Girl dont give a fuck cause u fine
I miss em fo i kiss em
I pack em fo i stack em
So while we in the club betta get these girls
Cause on the streets there aint no action
