[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne & (Pitbull)]
Ooh, I got a new one for ya
I like the way that sounds (reportin' live from Spain)
I'm 'bout to do it for ya
I like to break it down (tuxedo)
This joint has got me open
Uh that's my favorite song (Mr. Worldwide)
I put my thing in motion (I don't know how I do what I do)
I do it all night long (I just do it)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You know the résumé
Call it what you want, boy, as it may
Not from the bay, but hella paid
Everyday above ground is a good day so I celebrate
Mami got that bubble-yum booty
I wanna run through it like Rudy
She said "Do you own Nike?"
I said "not yet", she said "then just do it"
Fresh at the Grammy's in a tuxedo
Play about 18 holes on any given day
Tiger Woods steelo, yeah, I get around, but only on the D-Low
Now I'm changing the world
Just to think I used to dream about kilos
Bank account used to be negative
Now it's like that thing on reload, do it

[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne]
I got a new one for ya
I like the way that sounds
I'm 'bout to do it for ya
I like to break it down
This joint has got me open
Ooh, that's my favorite song
I put my thing in motion
I do it all night long

[Post-Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne & (Pitbull)]
Do it, do it, do it
Oh, here I go again
(Gotta hit 'em with that) Do it
Do it
Do it
(Hit 'em, hit 'em with that) Do it
(Yea, go ahead baby and) Do it
(Go ahead, baby and) Do it
(Go ahead, baby, and) Do it
(That's right)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
They want what never heard before
Never seen before, never worn before
But if they only knew, everything's been done before
I'm half of an outcast like Love Below
Instagram; now they take pics
When I was growing up, Instagram was a nick
Man, what a trip
Bogota, Medellin, Colombia
Man, what a trip
If you been there
Then you know what I'm talkin' bout
I'm runnin' through the world, y'all walk it out
It's a marathon, not a sprint
Long term, that's how I think
My life could've turned out ugly
I'm talkin' ugly, generino
But I turned it all around and hit the jackpot
De Niro, Casino, dale, woo!

[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne]
I got a new one for ya
I like the way that sounds
I'm 'bout to do it for ya
I like to break it down
This joint has got me open
Ooh that's my favorite song
I put my thing in motion
I do it all night long

[Post-Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne & (Pitbull)]
Do it, do it, do it
Oh, here I go again
(Gotta hit 'em with that) Do it
Do it
Do it
(Hit 'em, hit 'em with that) Do it
(Yea, go ahead baby and) Do it
(Go ahead baby and) Do it
(Go ahead baby and) Do it

[Bridge: Mayer Hawthorne & (Pitbull), Both]
(That's right, take it to the bridge)
Been working hard and now the weekend is here
Give it your best shot
Show me what you got (It's time to)
Light one, put it in the atmosphere
Give it your best shot
Show me what you got
I got that lightning feeling from my head to my toes
Give it your best shot
Show me what you got
So tonight, I'm really gonna let myself go
(Give it your best shot)
Show me what you got

[Outro: Pitbull]
Dale mamita
Jump out the sandbox
Come play with these big boys
You know we're cooler than a polar bear toe nails
Oh yea
That's right
