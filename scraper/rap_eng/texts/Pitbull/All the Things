[Intro: Pitbull]
Pitbull
International sensation
INNA
And Mr. Worldwide, dale

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm like a quarterback, I got options
But I play the point in school
Broke ankles, more than a few
Broke hearts, yeah that too
Twenty years later, same movie, same script
Same player, more chips
More women, more haters
Different toilet, same shh...
Why get caught up in emotions?
Why go through the same motions?
In a sick way she loves to see me mad
It gets her wetter than the ocean
She's a good girl gone bad
But bad girls don't like good guys
Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy
That's what I though, ha let's ride

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
They had a card, but they got soft hearts
And I know they soft spots
I meet 'em, I greet 'em, I train 'em
And show 'em all about Hard Knox
Listen, next thing you know (next thing you know)
They holding the fort down like Fort Knox
Then they fall in love and make everything seem what it's not
Damn!
These are called rules of engagement
Welcome to the world of entertainment
They don't want a man like Rayman
They want a man that's duck in the Raymond's
I know it's ironic
But the good girls love bad guys
Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?
That's what I though, now let's ride

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed

[Chorus: INNA]
All the things you do, all the things you say
Playin' with my heart so I can run away
All the things you did, all the things you said to me
Said to me, said
Now I'm lonely in my bed
