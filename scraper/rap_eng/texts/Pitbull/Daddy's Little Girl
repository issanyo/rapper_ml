[Intro]
This is for all the women
That have been stripped of their innocence
She was daddy's little girl
But no matter what
They kept their head up
And this is my way of saying thank you
All alone in the world

[Chorus]
Confused and don't know what to think
Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Confused and don't know what to think
Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
To find for herself cause she thought that she was
Daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl
She was daddy's little girl

[Verse 1]
I was raised by women, a woman made me a man
It's just to bad that a man, took her innocence
And god knows that I, I would finish him
Diminish him, end up killin' him
Blame it on the ignorance, that's were her childhood went
New country, new language, that's how 7 years were spent
Time you can't buy it, and some lose 'em here
I know that we bumped heads, just know mom that I'm here
Cuba Peter Pan, the rebelution was crazy
I wanna thank you mom, for the way you raised me
All your life you wanted only one thing
And that was to say
She was daddy's little girl

[Chorus]
Confused and don't know what to think
Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Confused and don't know what to think
Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
To find for herself cause she thought that she was
Daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl
She was daddy's little girl

[Verse 2]
Took care of me, just like a mother
Till you got pregnant, then you was off to Georgia
It was tough how we, how we were brought up
Tougher for you, cause you had no father
Now I understand, now that I'm a man
How much a woman needs someone to call dad
You cut through the pain, you walked through the rain
The game ain't playin' you, baby you play the game
Now you're in search of that father figure
And if you find him, he denies you, Jenny fuck that nigga
Karmas a bitch, even though I know she wish
She was daddy's little girl

[Chorus]
Confused and don't know what to think
Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Confused and don't know what to think
Cause she thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
To find for herself cause she thought that she was
Daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl
She thought that she was
She was daddy's little girl
Daddy's little girl
She was daddy's little girl

[Outro]
This is for all the women that stayed strong
And beat all the odds
She was daddy's little girl
The ones that have been raped, the ones that grew up fatherless
All alone in the world
But still found a way to raise their kids
To do the right thing
She was daddy's little girl
This is for y'all, I love y'all
