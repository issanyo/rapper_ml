That is of course
If you want some of this Candyman
Just stand in front of the mirror
Say "Candyman" three times

Baby, just call me
(Candyman)
You know they call me
(Candyman)

That's right they call me
(Candyman)
Every city, every state, every country

Mami I'm known as
(Candyman)
Baby just call me
(Candyman)

When ya want some of this
(Candyman)
Say name in the mirror
Three times baby, just call me

I don't think that you're ready for the bang bang
When I bump in the guts
I be tearin' it up doin' my thang thang

Hey, hey, hey little mama
I'd love to see that ass
In Victoria's Secret pajamas

Yes, yes, yes
I'm a freak freak that eats
Eats pussy like Jeffrey Dahmer

Ay mi madre, gimme a night
And I promise I'll change ya life
But remember, baby girl that you're not my wife

Other then that I don't give a fuck
Let's keep in touch

Baby, just call me
(Candyman)
You know they call me
(Candyman)

That's right they call me
(Candyman)
Every city, every state, every country

Mami I'm known as
(Candyman)
Baby just call me
(Candyman)

When ya want some of this
(Candyman)
Say name in the mirror
Three times baby, just call me
