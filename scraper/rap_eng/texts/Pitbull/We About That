[Intro: DJ Buddha]
Fall in line season has officialy begun
So for everyone that got a lot of shit to say
Shut the fuck up and fall in line
It's DJ Noodles, DJ Buddha, and Pitbull
Congrats homie, I know you a free agent now
I think it's time we go in on them
Fix your face, Let's go

[Hook 1: Pitbull (DJ Noodles)]
Pit's loco: for no,no
But he always rolls with like 18 hoes
I'm tired of these boys with their raps
About jets, about coke, about crack, about smack
Little buddy here's the facts

When it comes to the ride, they there first to bitch
When they see them feds 'round they the first to snitch
When they get that money, they the first to snitch
And if you blow first aid, they the first to talk shit

Pit's loco: for no,no
But he always rolls with like 18 hoes
I'm tired of these boys with their raps
About jets, about coke, about crack, about smack
*DJ Noodles!*

Pit's loco: for no,no
But he always rolls with like 18 hoes
I'm tired of these boys with their raps
About jets, about coke, about crack, about smack
Little buddy here's the facts (fix your face)

When it comes to the ride, they there first to bitch
When they see them feds 'round they the first to snitch
When they get that money, they the first to snitch
And if you blow first aid, they the first to talk shit


[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I learned not to trust, not to care
Me I just breathe, and I'm taking they air
Me I don't talk, I don't have time to share
They can walk it out but they going nowhere
I see em like kids: I don't hit em, I spank em
They try to oversee me, me I'm overseas banking
They still in the hood with the coke and weed stinking
Do yourself a favor, don't get Abraham Lincoln

See them haters in the club asking what they drinking
Look them in the eye, you can tell what they thinking
They think that they Pit's cuz they got a ring on they pinky
And stretch a lil' coke like slinky, Please!

[Hook 2: Pitbull]
We about the cream, we about that bread, we about that cash
We about the cream, we about that bread, we about that cash
We about the cream, we about that bread, we about that cash
We about the cream, we about that bread, we about that cash

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
My nights are getting shorter, my nights are getting longer
I'm on the road, moving quietly, getting stronger
My prime game is, hard to describe
I can feel the Envy, I can feel the hate, I can feel your body
You can feel, that you feel, that I'm always something'
Yeah right, that when the things go to jumping in the cage
Used to ripping in that moss, word goes the pumping
Your boys rappin' say a whole lot of nothing
Im like that, to coke in water
When you'll think I dissolve, I come back harder
I add the nigga that made magic
When he threw the coke in the pot
So we call him Harry Potter
Time ain't, Est√©e Lauder
It ain't something you can make up, so wake up
Don't you little drug dealers got cookies to bake up
Only time you'll every cut a cake up
Is during you birthday, these chicos are hungry, these chicos are thirsty
But really it hurts man, in the worse way
To put sludge through people that I used to show love to

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Pitbull]
We about that!
