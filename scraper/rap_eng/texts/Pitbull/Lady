[Intro: Pitbull]
This is for the beautiful girls around the world
Mr. Worldwide
This is for the beautiful girls around the world
Austin M., talk to 'em

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
I don't know your game, but it's magic
I like how it feels when we're dancing
Just let go, don't make it a challenge baby, yeah baby
So give me yours and girl I'll give you mine
Show me something for I spend some time
'Cause I got love I wanna make all night
With you baby, with you baby

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Now I'm back in the love alert
Laidback, open up, now it's my turn
Let me make sure that you feel right, feel good
Feel wet, feel freaky, feel nasty, feel wood
It's all good, we can keep it on the low, hush hush
I made it skate skate skate, no rush
We can make straight love or straight fuck
As long as EPT say no plus
(Lady)
Lately, I've been thinkin' 'bout you my baby
I've been thinkin' bout sexin' you crazy
I've been thinkin' 'bout doin' the things you shouldn't do
Like in a bathroom star with a car
On the dancefloor, over the bar
Or next time in L.A., pull over, get off, and you feel me right next to my Hollywood star
Play with it

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Bridge: Austin Mahone]
Lady
Lady, ooh

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
