[Bridge: T-Pain]
I feel so much better
I know I said I'll never ever drink again
But now I feel like I never had before
Get out on the floor and show 'em what it's for

[Hook: T-Pain](x2)
'Trón can I get that Remy can I get that Coke can I get that Henny
Can I get that margarita on the rock rock rock
Can I get salt all around that rim rim rim rim

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Can I get that
When I walk up in the club gonna hit that
Shawty wanna break me off like a Kit-Kat
Get a couple bottles and a couple models and I wanna sip that Patrón!
Put 'em in the zone can I get that Henny when I'm already in it
Can I get that margarita when I'm chilling with a mamachita
Mama see you later home tonight I know
I said I should stay in my bed
I'm in the floor instead party rocking with my baby
So now I never say never she leave me if I let her
That's why I gotta keep her on the dance floor
Said I

Where my alcoholics at (x8)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I'm late for whatever whenever y'all know the game
It's Mr. Todo el Mundo and Pain you know the name
They be go to private school but now it's private planes
And we stay around the world in hotels under private names
Bartender give me your Voli water line and
Put your drinks in the air it's Voli time
Everybody rap about Patron
The difference is this low cal and Voli's mine
I don't mean to brag so don't think wrong
Guess I'm out of backpain let's get our drink on
Mama over there named Judy
And she got a tutty fruity juicy booty
You can put a drink on
Everybody got their cards but they ain't chipped in
Know what that means they ain't drinking
These type of things happen all the time
Y'all better get yours cause I'm gonna get mine
