Pleasure yes God bless I love my women rated triple X
Let me show you how we do it round here
And the women they don't fake they get naked down here
It's the bottom no bras no drawers
The bottom where they holler "Take it off!"
The bottom where we turn out daughters just to plan a lick on the father we got 'em

Party, imma take it, imma take it to her mouth
Boy, imma take 'em, imma take 'em to the south
Where the schools got classes like Jay-Z's reasonable doubt

For them boys on the block yellin' we bass blowed
Watch where you're at 'cause they will tell ya so
