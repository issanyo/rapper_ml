[Pitbull]
That little chico Pitbull, Mr. 305
Used to live in every neighborhood in Miami
Putting it down with them tanners (hola)
Vedo-no Shake, what they do
Bang, welcome home
Demi, bet that up
Yessir
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Flaking the pot and watch it swim 90 miles, buddy
Vedo, Bang, Pitbull, it's all money
Grab the spatula
Pot racks and batch it up
Call him, bust that ass, niggas
Cause they still cashing up
It's more than Arm & Hammer
When them choppers cop
It's, it's bananas
Whipping up Carol City
Back it in Little Havana
Take it to Hotlanta
Then take it to Alabama
Where they do damage cause they
Breaking a nickel bag and they grabbing 'em
The Florida boys will squeeze the juice out of brick
To the point they'll even half-drop a hand, saying "oh shit"
One time for them tanners (hola)
Two times for the crib (305)
Three times for my dawg Demi with a ten-year bid
I left the streets alone
Bang, welcome home
Demi gave me the word
Now it's time to get in on
Vedo, Pitbull and Bang
Hey yo, switch over rain
Them boys gon' do they thing
Welcome to Dade County man
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
[Vedo-no Shake]
Well if this money make it happen
Choppers clapping in your rearview
They talking cash with this mask, need a min or two?
Nine times outta ten
If he gon' rob, he gon' kill too
Pit gave the word, shot a bird
How it fell through
Now if you want it, want it, dawg
You can get it, get it
I do it for some change
Ain't no shame how she work with it
Twerk with it, lean with it, rock with it
Put it in a pack, make some g's on the block with it
Folds up, we got that fire brown
You can get yours right here
Start tripping if you wanna, boy
You can lose it right here
Yeah, right here, you can make it bubble up
X-man, ain't no question, I keep 'em doubled up
I'm from that south, south, with golds in my mouth, mouth
Representing my A, it ain't the same in a drought, drought
My homies don't fake, they call me No Shake
Prices going up, still got cake and it ain't my birthday
[Pitbull]
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
[Bang]
I deal with ho's, pounds, quarters
Can I take your order
Boatloads, crash the boat, in Florida
It ain't for 10 g's, that's only in Tennessee
Miami Heat just won, a brick done went for 23
Bang, call me Saddam in this land, the hood terrorist
Get soldiers with the bomb in their hands
Got grams, like extra ???, not Narcs, you stupid?
You can smoke it, sell it, fucking snort it or shoot it
Well if I even much think Imma snort it and shoot it
And bring the whole kitchen sink, how the army'll do it
But the truth is, we ain't tryna get the strap off
We'd rather save our shells and sell crack raw
Hold up, code they finna take it over with baking soda
If you ain't down with Vedo or Pitbull, you ain't a soldier
The dunes call it Coca-Cola, dreds call it coco nuts
Colombians, coco leaves, kids eat your Cocoa Puffs
[Pitbull]
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
That's when you lick of all the yellow
And you sell the white (that's right)
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
We call it, lemonhead delight
