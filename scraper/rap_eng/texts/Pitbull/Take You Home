(feat. Oobie)

Everytime i see you, youre trying to take me home
And it makes me wonder, if we were to get it on
Would you take the time to touch me.. (touch me)
And take me in to extacyy yeahh

(chorus x2)
And i wonder if i take you home
Would you give me your love baby
Would you fufill my fantasys
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)

Mami whats up with you
I just wanna get to know you better
Mami you tight word
And i know i can get you wetter
I know you hear this a lot
And i know you fed up
I know life is hard, but you gotta keep your head up
You got the real game.. ccheck
Nail game.. ccheck
Hair game.. ccheck
Everything.. ccheck
Thats why i can't wait to slip off your clothes and lick you from head to toe
And give you some of this fine head til you explodeee
I wanna make you cum til you can cum no mo'
I wanna see you girl, roll your toess
I wanna be the one to turn you out
Ima show you what i be about
Im not a hot boy, ima hot man
That'll eat yo ass, til you say god damn
Girl i love this
And if you think you got some undefeated tyson pussy, bitch i'm buster douglas

(chorus x2)
And i wonder if i take you home
Would you give me your love baby
Would you fufill my fantasys
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)

I wanna be that man, that youve.. never had before
I wanna be that man, that'll put it on you fast and slow
I wanna be, everything that you need baby and more
It would be no fun, if i told you everything thats in store
Youve got those body parts, i just wanna explore
Coma with me loco, ven paca mi amor..
You got my two boys, below my waistline, singing the blues
Tell me baby, honestly, what is it exactly you got to losee
Nothing theres always some time in the wall*
And now you know you want some moree
Ima have you going crazy, praising the lordd
I fuck like i rap, hardcore
Im not a hot boy, ima hot man
That'll eat yo ass, til you say god damn
Girl i love this
And if you think you got some undefeated tyson pussy, bitch i'm buster douglas

(chorus x4)
And i wonder if i take you home
Would you give me your love baby
Would you fufill my fantasys
Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)
