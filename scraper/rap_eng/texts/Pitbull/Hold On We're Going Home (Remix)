[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I don’t row deep
No, I’m not a G but I do fly Gs
Them boys want Ms
Me, I wanna be, them boys wannabes
Don’t know they’re A, Bs and Cs
But they run around claiming Bs ad Cs
Be careful, baby, it’s contagious
Me, I’m immune to these haters
These boys give away money like they allergic to paper
I’mma bury the game, undertaker
Big baller, no, big balls, yeah
I put my money where my mouth is
Give me about five years
And I’mma build something for my grandkids’ grandkids
That’s why when I saw you I had to come over and let you know

[Hook: Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we’re going home
Just hold on, we’re going home
It’s hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we’re going home

[Bridge: Majid Jordan]
You’re the girl, you’re the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there’s something, baby
I think there’s something, baby
You’re the girl, you’re the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there’s something, baby
I think there’s something, baby

[Outro: Drake]
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we’re going home
Just hold on, we’re going home
It’s hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we’re going home
