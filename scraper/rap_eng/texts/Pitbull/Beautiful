[Intro: Frankie J]
I turn my head to the right and there you are
With a smile upon your face
And all I could say is, damn you're beautiful
I can't stop thinking about you
Girl you're always on my mind
And all I could say is, damn you're beautiful

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
Hey love, it's funny after all this time
Your touch still kinda blows my mind
Your hands must have been made in heaven
In heaven, baby
Your hips shake like a Spanish guitar
Your lips, they could be a work of art
I love the way you're put together, together

[Hook: Frankie J]
I turn my head to the right and there you are
With a smile upon your face
And all I could say is, damn you're beautiful
I can't stop thinking about you
Girl you're always on my mind
And all I could say is, damn you're beautiful

[Verse 2: Frankie J]
You got me on permanent lock
I crave your body around the clock
I plan to keep you here forever
Forever baby
Cause those eyes tell me you're the only one
Your smile is harder than the morning sun
You're moaning so perfectly for me, Beautiful

[Hook: Frankie J]
I turn my head to the right and there you are
With a smile upon your face
And all I could say is, damn you're beautiful
I can't stop thinking about you
Girl you're always on my mind
And all I could say is, damn you're beautiful

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
She's down for whatever (That's right)
No matter the weather (She would)
Do anything (Just to)
Make me feel better (That's why)
I owe her my loyalty
And treat her like royalty
Baby you on to me
And that's why I give you all of me
Let's look to the future (look to the future)
And laugh at the past (ha ha)
I'm in love with you (in love with you)
But obsessed with your ass (que rica)
You know what I mean (know what I mean)
I wake up to a dream (wake up to a dream)
Every time I see you
Damn, you're beautiful

[Hook: Frankie J]
I turn my head to the right and there you are
With a smile upon your face
And all I could say is, damn you're beautiful
I can't stop thinking about you
Girl you're always on my mind
And all I could say is, damn you're beautiful
