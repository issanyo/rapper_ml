[Chorus: R Kelly & Austin Mahone]
I wanna take love out, I wanna buy love drinks
I want to have a good time, I wanna show love things
I wanna hold love's hand, I wanna bottle love up
I want to dance with love 'til the sun comes up
I wanna be with love, I wanna touch love, I'm in love with love
I wanna walk for love, I wanna trust love, I need your love
I wanna treat love right
Love this is your night (hey DJ!)
This is dedicated to love

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I can tell by the way that you talk
And the things that you say, that you know what you want, for sure
I can tell by the way that you walk, that you know what you're doin'
That turns me even more
I can tell that you're passionate, and love crazy sex, yes
I can tell that you have an open mind and love to have a good time, yes
Baby I was built a little different (different)
I was raised by a real life (real life)
Let me show you what love is, I promise it'll change your life

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly & Mahone]
I wanna kiss love, i wanna feel love, make love to love
Last call when the club is over, I wanna leave with love
I wanna treat love right, love this is your night
[All: Hey DJ!]
This is dedicated to love

[Hook: Pitbull & Mahone]
Everybody say
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love, l-l-l-love
Get your hands up for love
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love, l-l-l-love

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
One love, one life, but tonight we gonna do it twice
Wanna know what you want, wanna know what you like
'Cause tonight we gonna to do it right
They say the devil's in the details
And baby you're detailed
I don't deal with social media, everything is strictly done on the DL
Calladita mas bonita, dale chica
I was built a little different (different)
I was raised by a real life (real life)
Let me show you what love is, I promise it will change your life

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly & Mahone]
I wanna kiss love, i wanna feel love, make love to love
Last call when the club is over, I wanna leave with love
I wanna treat love right, love this is your night
[All: Hey DJ!]
This is dedicated to love

[Hook]
Everybody say
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love, l-l-l-love
Get your hands up for love
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love, l-l-l-love

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Baby what you see is what you get
It might not always be right
What you see is what you get
But I'll change your life
Baby what you see is what you get
It might not always be right
What you see is what you get
But I'll change your life

[Outro: R Kelly & Mahone]
I'm gonna...
Bet my money on love
Win it all for love
Pour some more in my cup
Cause this is dedicated to love
I'm gonna bet my money on love
Win it all for love
Pour some more in my cup
'Cause this is dedicated to love
'Cause this is dedicated to love
This is dedicated to love
