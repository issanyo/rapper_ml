[Intro: Pitbull & T Pain]
Mr. Worldwide, T- Pain
El que no vale consejo, no llega viejo
So listen up

Let her go, lalala
Baby girl wanna play, let her go
Said let her go, lalala
Baby girl wanna play, let her go
Said let her go, lalala
Baby girl wanna play, let her go
Said let her go, lalala
Baby girl, wanna play, let her go
Got it Pain?

[Refrain: T-Pain]
Hey, baby girl, what you doing tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store (hey, hey baby)
You’re giving it your all when you’re dancing on me
I wanna see if you can give me some more (hey, hey baby)
You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want (hey, hey baby)
Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back and the front (hey, hey baby)

[Hook: Pitbull & T-Pain]
(Pitbull)
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala

(T-Pain)
Ooh, drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say hey baby
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make me wanna say hey baby
Ooh you got it cause you
Make me wanna say hey baby
Ooh don’t stop it
I want you tonight

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I’m a Dade county, self paid, self-made millionaire
I used to play around the world
Now I’m around the world, getting paid
Girl problems, no problems
Don’t hate the game that won’t solve it
I want to get with you mami
Now let me see where the Lord split you, (dale)

[Refrain: T-Pain]
Hey, baby girl, what you doing tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store (hey, hey baby)
You’re giving it your all when you’re dancing on me
I wanna see if you can give me some more (hey, hey baby)
You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want (hey, hey baby)
Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back and the front (hey, hey baby)

[Hook: Pitbull & T-Pain]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Make money, make money
This chica right here gotta eat baby
Scared money don’t make money
That’s how it goes in the street baby
But enough with the the nonsense
Baby girl, take a shot to clear your conscience
Not a goon or a God, I’m a monster
Cause I hit all baddest woman in the world, gangsta

[Hook: Pitbull & T-Pain]
