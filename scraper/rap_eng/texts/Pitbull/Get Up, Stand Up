[Hook 1 (Pitbull)]
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
(Ha, ha, ha)

Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up

[Verse 1: Vein]
I want to rock right now
My name's Vein and I came to get down
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known to get your girl alone
I got more game, but girls believe me
I have a sweat before that you could see me
Could it be I'm about to be on TV
Because I'm hated by many that want to be me
Fo' sheezy, believe me
I does a bitch for no reason
Four rooms at the four seasons
She guaranteed to have to stop breathin'
I'm leanin',but after we get through
Girl I'm leavin',Back to the club to try to sneak in
And bring something home for the weekend (get up!)

[Hook 2 (Pitbull)]
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
Get up, stand up throw your hands up
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up
(Ha, ha, ha)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Pack it up, pack it in
Baby back it up, treat your ass like a truck
Back it in, hit a shot, press your luck
Better do the Aflac, better duck
Bring your ass down like the NASDAQ
Burn it up, I'm on fire
I hear them boys and their raps, but they liars
Try snitchin', might as well, well why ya
What it is, what it ain't, what you think of
Baby here the picture, paints
Mr. 305 is worldwide
Been all around the world, the world is mine
You can sleep with your girl, but your girl is mine
Basically what's mine is mine what's yours is mine
What you playin'
Better sleep with your eyes open
Keep hopin' I'm a fail you goin' die hopin'
Big Vein, a pair of soldiers
Spit flames, game over bitch (let's go!)

[Hook]

[Bridge: Vein]
Let's go (hands up) let's ride (put 'em up)
It's Vein (hands up) all night (put 'em up right now)
Let's go (hands up) let's ride (put 'em up)
It's Vein (hands up) all night (throw your hands up)
Let's go (hands up) let's ride (put 'em up)
It's Vein (hands up) all night (put 'em up right now)
Let's go (hands up) let's ride (put 'em up)
It's Vein (hands up) all night (throw your hands up)

[Verse 3: Vein]
Let the bass bump
Let the cat sizzle, 'til I hit in the ass
Then that ass jiggle
Play the flip flop, like a deck of cards
They can make it rain, I just make it drizzle hard
I got a passion for rappin'
So let's get it on so I can rap about what happened
I got the red light flashin' so
Get up, stand up, come and throw your hands up

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Vein]
Vein
I think we broke some rules on this one
I bet you want to ask somethin'
That's what I thought
