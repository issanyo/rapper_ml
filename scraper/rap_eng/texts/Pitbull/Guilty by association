[Intro]
Man...
I hate it when i'm in the club or when i'm on the streets and..
All these cats run upon me talkin' bout' what they doin' and..
Who they set a lick on or how many bricks they flip, and I mean
I really don't need to hear that shit to be honest with you dawg..

[Hook(x2)]
I'ts cool you flip birds, don't bring that shit around me
(Guilt-guilty by association)
I heard you was snitching so don't come around me
(Guilt-Guilt-guilty by association)
I heard you're talkin' licks, don't talk that shit around me
(Guilt-Guilt-guilty by association)
Cause' i ain' getting them that if them fools around me
(Guilt-Guilt-guilty by association)

[Verse 1]
Call me Miami hero hero cause this deals with the track
Blow my mind like R.teel, yes it's wrong but it's real
Fuckboys, they know the deal, Pitbull done started a revolution, now all they wanna do is follow, follow, but chill
I went from tia serving me meals, to makin' a meal
So fuck what you feel, talk is cheap so fuck a grill
Miami got them boys that's real, trill
Now, full of, gold, grills, sell steel
And only got notes that they kill bills
You can tell them boys is rookies
When they make it rain in the club
You can tell them boys is rookies
When they got a hundred ones on the dub
I love it when they think they big time, but they just servin' cookies
And i love when they think they from the hood
And they just suburban pussies
I'm off in the sky boxing tootsies, with Pepe knock chasin' pussies
Just lookin' for investors to back this movement we pushin'
I ain't comfortable till' everything i make is kushin', and everyday becomes knuckling but (?)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Dime con quien tu van da, y  te digo quien tu eres
Pitbull el rapero, pero negociante Armando Perez
I rap for them low-key-boys, get money low key boy
And thanks to this rap shit
I don't gotta hear nothin' bout' no keys boy
But it's like everywhere i go
Everybody's moving blow by the boatloads (wow!)
And then they get on records
And rap about the shit on cold like if they don't know
These boys get away for the spare of cocaine
Which is the reason they ain't aged in the rap game
The feds, cabs, bobs, wise, they'll listen to everything they say
You can deny it until you get federally indicted (Damn!
Accounts frozen and family get put on a diet (Damn!)
Them big boys who push heavy weighting on that iron lining
I'm tryna blow to the point that I can tell
Donald Trumph you're fired
I did what i had to do to get where I'm at
I pushed a little this, I pushed a little that
But now that the game let me in
I ain't never goin' back, and buddy, you can bet that
Having problems moving weight, man, i wish i could help
But rap is my meal ticket so keep them bricks to ya self

[Hook]
