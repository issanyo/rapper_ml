[Verse 1]
I made you look
It's Pitbull spitting hard like a gangsta crook
I'm a crook, Imma thief'em, robbing streets
I'm robbin' hoods, it's like Robbin Givings
When i'm robbin' you're givin up all your goods
I made robbin' a livin', i made robbin' a hobby
I rob you in the kitchen, i rob you in the lobby
I rob you while you're shittin'
And if these choppers feel choppy ain't nothing gonna stop me

I made you look
It's Pitbull spitting hard like a gansta crook
I'm a crook, Imma thief'em, robbing streets
I'm robbin' hoods, it's like Robbin Givings
When i'm robbin' you're givin up all your goods
I made robbin' a livin', i made robbin' a hobby
I rob you in the kitchen, i rob you in the lobby
I rob you while you're shittin'
And if these choppers feel choppy ain't nothing gonna stop me

Pitbull but mamis call me papi
When i'm dressed in lennen with a splash at Issey Miyake
I wax ass like Mr. "Miyaki"
Pit's modest but my dick is "cocky"
I think some of y'all are in the wrong game
Cuz all ya do is rap about ice man
Y'all should play hockey
My stocks are on a steady climb
So i guess that's why i feel kinda "stocky"
When guns pop they'll leave you like sloppy joe's
I fuck down bitches and i fuck sloppy hoes
She wanted me to fuck her brains out
So i stuck my dick through her nose
Pit's ready for war like if there's a storm
But no one had a clue that the only Pit allowed in Miami spits guerrilla warfare like Vietnam
So bring'em on, now everybody sing along

[Hook]
Every time i spit a rhyme you may not know who i am
But maybe this uh, made you remember
