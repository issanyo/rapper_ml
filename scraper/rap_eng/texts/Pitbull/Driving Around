[Hook: Vein (Pitbull)]
Driving Around, looking in the mirror
What do I see?
Somebody I thought I would never be
It's amazing but it's funny to me
If you only knew where I came from

Driving Around, looking in the mirror
What do I see?
Somebody I thought I would never be
It's amazing but it's funny to me
(Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Banga Banga Bang Bang Bang
Pit in this thanga thanga thang thang
Swing it (da) dang lang lang lang
Off the chain-a lang lang lang
Took this game-a game game game
Created my own line-a line line line
Can't you see I'm loco?
Insane in the membrane
My hearts so cold, my bloods just chill
I'm not Cypress Hill, but I'm gon' be real
AK-4-7, full banana clip
Dale more ninito
Go 'head banana snip like

Driving Around, looking in the mirror
What do I see?
Somebody I thought I would never be
It's amazing but it's funny to me
If you only knew where I came from

Driving Around, looking in the mirror
What do I see?
Somebody I thought I would never be
It's amazing but it's funny to me

[Verse 2: David Rush & Vein]
(David Rush)
Now Vein's in thanga thang thang thang
Flippin' the game-a game game game
You's too big to say your name
But now petty is my name-a name name name
You must understand you can't control us
We came from nothing but could you throw us
We couldn't even afford fruit roll-ups
Now I'm rolling up whips that make you throw up
Big shout out to the teachers that told me I never was gonna be shit
Big shout out to the non-believers that see me ridin my dick

(Vein)
Wish you could see how good it feels to say
Fuck you, pay me, cause that's the only way

[Verse 3: David Rush]
Now rush in this thing - wait!
They already know that
Imma bullshit, like an MJ throwback
Remember when haters say I used to be so wack
And a girlfriend with a pic like Kodak

The road been long
But I've through with the wheels of an F-150
And adapted to me
Brought 25, my fame hit the morning
Miss me!
But I'm still here, am I?
Making my dreams a reality
And if you wanna take that from me
You're gonna have to pull that outta me
They try to say this ain't real
And everything's not what it seems
But Imma laugh all the way to the bank
Call it the million-dollar-dream!
