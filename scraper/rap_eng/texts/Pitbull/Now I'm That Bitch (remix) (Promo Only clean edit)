Mr. 3-0-5
Putting it down with the Queen Livvi
But I ain't gonna call you Livvi
Pero Mamita, why don't you let them know who you are?

Hi, my name is
You won't remember
Wait 'til December
'Cause you thought that I was pure as snow
Guess you didn't know

Hold tight, surprise
Open your eyes, it's springtime
Flowers blossoming, I am one of them
Bet you like how I've grown

'Cause now I'm that cbitch
You'll never get to, uh
Can't get what you want
So you're acting like a punk

You were too fly then
So fly away now
Now I'm that bitch
And you're just a clown

Why should I even remember?
Back when you blanked me
To put it frankly
But now, I'm back
I'm not attracted
And you're not getting none

'Cause I'm not for the takin'
I'm not a bender
Return to sender
I'll laugh at you
Even asking to
To get with me tonight

'Cause now I'm that bitch
You'll never get to, uh
Can't get what you want
So you're acting like a punk

You were too fly then
So fly away now
Now I'm that bitch
And you're just a clown

'Cause now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
And you're just a clown

Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Yeah, look at me now

You passed me by
Never looked twice
Now I'm the chick
You wanna be with

Isn't it so funny now?
I'm the one to shut you down
Don't worry girls
If he didn't notice you, yeah
Soon he'll be beggin' to

Oye, mamita, calmate, I feel ya
We all get burned
Those who survive are the ones that learn

If it don't kill you, make you stronger
Pero no te ponga como una chonga
Even though I ain't gonna lie
It turns me on a little bit when you act like a bitch

Mama, I know what you went through was hard
But the biggest bitch is karma, let her do her job
(That's right)
Don't even stress these clowns
(Nope)
Baby, you a queen
Here's the crown

Enjoy yourself, you independent now
(That's right)
They lose, and you winnin' now
(That's right)
You a shootin' star
Now let them know who you are

'Cause now I'm that bitch
You'll never get to, uh
Can't get what you want
So you're acting like a punk

You were too fly then
So fly away now
Now I'm that bitch
And you're just a clown

'Cause now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
And you're just a clown

Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Yeah, look at me now
