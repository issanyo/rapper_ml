[Intro: Pitbull (Steven A. Clark)]
Ape Drums, Steven Clark, and yours truly
Mr. W.W., haha!
I told you once (Can't Have)
I tell you twice (Can't Have)
The grass looks greener on the other side
Til you get to the other side, haha

[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad
But I guess we always want what we can't have
You know the loneliness hurts so bad
And girl I want you back
But I guess we always want what we can't have

[Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Can't have
Can't have
Can't have
Ohhhhhh!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I see Central Park from my hotel room
And it's got me thinking
About the crazy things we used to do
For the fame, for the power, for the fortune
Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate
It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it
Thinking that the sky was the limit
'Til I figured out there's footprints on the moon
Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
Everyone wants what they can't have right?

[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad
But I guess we always want what we can't have
You know the loneliness hurts so bad
And girl I want you back
But I guess we always want what we can't have

[Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, ohhhhhh!

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Looking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean
Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches
Drama, chaos, and different cultures
That's what allows me to see through these vultures
First we shined the shoes
Then we own the shoe shop
First we make the sandwich
Then we own the restaurants
First then we clean the house
Then we own every house on the block
Not bad for some immigrants

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
Everyone wants what they can't have right?

[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Well you're happy now
And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad
But I guess we always want what we can't have
You know the loneliness hurts so bad
And girl I want you back
But I guess we always want what we can't have

[Hook: Steven A. Clark]
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, can't have
Can't have, ohhhhhh!

[Outro: Steven A. Clark]
But I guess we always want what we can't have
