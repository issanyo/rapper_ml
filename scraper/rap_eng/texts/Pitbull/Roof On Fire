[Hook]
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!

[Verse 1]
Independent like a motherfucker [?]
Build another twenty schools
Let's show em how we ball
I ride for my city, I ride for my dawgs
Hit the mayor at the show
New Year's Eve, boy it's on
Man it's on in the [?]
Mr. 3-0-5, Mr. Took over the world
Mr. Stay-on-fire, Mr. Fuckboy-Free
Mr. Fuckboy-Please
Mr. Got-the-whole-game-on-its-knees
Let's ride

[Hook]
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!

[Verse 2]
Baby I got A-D-D, a delicious dick
And I'm ready to act a fool in this bitch
This chico stay slick, this chico stay lit
Imma change my name to Mr. Stay-rich
Been getting loose, been getting paid
3-0-5 representer, been repping Dade
I'm a chico in the game that spit that flame
That spit that fire, now let's get off the chain
Let's ride

[Hook]
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!

[Bridge]
Go DJ, Go DJ, the DJ's on fire
No pare, sigue, sigue
Go DJ, Go DJ, the DJ's on fire
No pare, sigue, sigue

[Hook]
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water
Let that motherfucka burn!

[Outro]
Burn motherfucker, Burn!
