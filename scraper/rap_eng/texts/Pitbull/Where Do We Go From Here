[Intro: Pitbull]
Let's, Mr. Worldwide (worldwide)
Take over (take over)
MK, love
Jim Jonson, Globe (globe)
Let's take over the globe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where do we go from here?
Where, tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
I want to where to tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
Somebody, please let me know
Where do we go from here?
I want the whole world to show
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
And I don't wanna do it alone
I want the world to dance

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Yeah, how you gon' tell me the sky's the limit, ha
When there's footprints on the moon?
I don't need a TV show to dance with the stars
Not me, I'm good
Half of the world don't like me
Half of the world wanna be me
But people deny
That pretty little thing they call Earth needs me (woo!)
I'm here to show the world what it is
To make something from nothing, yeah, for sure
I'm here to show the world what it is
To do good business, have glue without flow (hahaha)
I'm here to show the world
That money don't buy happiness, believe me, I know
But just one thing
Once I show the world, I just wanna know

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where do we go from here?
Where, tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
I want to where to tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
Somebody, please let me know
Where do we go from here?
I want the whole world to show
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
And I don't wanna do it alone
I want the world to dance

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
As the sun both fades and it gets bigger (yeah)
And the more countries in the world I hit up (hahaha)
I'm the bomb, double 0, 305
AKA, Mr. Worldwide (hahaha)
Don't be silly
I've had it on lock and that's for sure
And I've already changed my city
Now I'm on my way to change the globe
I'm tryna inspire the world and show 'em what it is
When you hustle and you work hard (yeah, yeah)
Show 'em what it is
To put your life on the line for the love of grind
Life is a rhyme with no reason
And that's the reason I rhymes (yeah)
But once I show the globe, haha, I just wanna know (woo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where do we go from here?
Where, tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
I want to where to tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
Somebody, please let me know
Where do we go from here?
I want the whole world to show
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
And I don't wanna do it alone
I want the world to dance
