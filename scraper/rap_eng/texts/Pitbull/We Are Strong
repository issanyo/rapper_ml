[Intro: Pitbull & Kiesza]
Mr. Worldwide, I just want to welcome everybody to my life
It's heaven on earth, but it's one hell of a ride
Let's show everybody why love is a battlefield
Tell them how you feel

[Chorus: Kiesza]
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally
But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me
I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible
Presidential debates unreliable
Politicians want to politick and politrick
That's why I call this shit politricks
I'm a young man, old soul
I can't listen to this new school shit
To me it's just so-so
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

[Chorus: Kiesza]
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s
Took over the game and they thought we were crazy
You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it
Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming
David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed
I learned from the worst, but listened to the best
Figure out that riddle and figure out success
I did my own thing, created my own lane
I may not like the players, but I love the game
I love the hustle and that's real
And that's why love is a battlefield

[Chorus: Kiesza]
We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demand
Love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield
