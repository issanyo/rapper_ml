Okay Shawty Mira
Running through checks got you dizzy
I'm so hot that I'm sizzling
It's my AP, not the A/C, that's chilly
Drop
I be walking around town like I won
The lotto
Donde quiera que boy dicen que est√°s borracho o loco
Yo dijo tampoco

Mamita would you like to play?
We love to see, would you stay
And if you say OK, we will play night and day
I'm such a dir-dir-dirty dawg
My teeth will unsnap your bra
But for now baby just pause
