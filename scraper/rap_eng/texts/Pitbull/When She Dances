[Intro: Pitbull]
Stephen Marley
Mr. Worldwide
History in the making
This for all the women that's been through it all
Seen it all, done it all, we feel you

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
She don't walk down every road
Way she smiles, it ever shows
That she's a freedom I've never known
She's a feeling you can't control

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And I had to go insane
Cause I've been watching her for a while
While she's moving her body
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na

[Chorus 1: Stephen Marley]
When she's dancing, yeah
She's the only star that shines
When she's dancing, yeah
Life's a playground
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
When she's dancing, yeah
When she's dancing, yeah

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
And so she keeps on moving like
She's dancing for her life
For all to see in open sight
She don't care who is watching

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And I had to go insane
Cause I've been watching her for a while
While she's moving her body
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na

[Chorus 2: Stephen Marley]
When she's dancing, yeah
There's no mountain she can't climb
When she's dancing, yeah
Life's a playground
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
When she's dancing, yeah
When she's dancing, yeah

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Mami got the mind of a hustler
Body of a goddess slash con artist
She's beautiful, fine, sexy, exotic
Graduated from street college
She about that money, 'bout that cash
She about that life, livin' on fast
She's a business slash entrepreneur when she's shaking that
She's the only star that shines
When she move them hips and makin' them wine
Make you feel like a king for one night
Set you up on a lick and rob you blind
With her, there's no losing
Half Jamaican, the other half Cuban
Mami's dangerous, especially if you're famous
Watch out

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
And so she keeps on moving like
She's dancing for her life
For all to see in open sight
She don't care who is watching

[Chorus 1: Stephen Marley]
When she's dancing, yeah
She's the only star that shines
When she's dancing, yeah
Life's a playground
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
DJ, play that music right that you know I like
When she's dancing, yeah
When she's dancing, yeah
