It's a true honor
I appreciate the love
Now let's show the whole world
How to have a good time

Roll with it

[Verse 1: Charlie Wilson]
Everybody's workin' hard for the weekend
And we're spendin' it all, yeah
When tomorrow comes
You know that you can sleep in
So you know that it's on, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Do what you wanna do
Go where you wanna go
Move how you wanna move

Step how you wanna step
Love who you wanna love

Wanna make this night a night to remember
Come on get off the wall (get off the wall)
Doin' anything you want

We can go all night long, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
You can bet that it's the right here
Turn you right and show you the time of your life
You can bet, you can bet
That I'll have you doin' things that are wrong
Makin' 'em feel right
That's right
You can bet, you can bet
You can say that you won't
But you will
And I know just what you want to feel
You can bet, you can bet
I'll take away that depression
With sweet lust, hot passion, and deep pressure
Have a good time girl
You can bet that
Little thing between your legs
I'm gonna wet that
No I won't sweat that
But I'll get that
Matter fact lay back
Let me lick that
Let me pl-pl-play with that little kitten
Momma there's no point
Don't fight the feelin'
There's absolutely nothin' wrong with a little sinnin'
You can't change up on your game in the 9th inning
Ha ha

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Good time
Good, good time
Good time
Everybody have a good time
Good time
Good, good time
Good time
Everybody have a good time

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, everybody have a good time
