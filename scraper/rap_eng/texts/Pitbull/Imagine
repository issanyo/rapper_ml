[John Lennon]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

[Rap Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine we could all get along
Won't be long
Til that day comes
Mothers, stop cookin', take off your aprons
Father, stop lookin' at every sports station
Take a second
And think of every poor nation
Making weapons
They can't afford a plate, no proper healthcare
Over here in Section 8, a lot on welfare
Yo, the wealthy laugh, the market crash, economy's bad
How did we change it, newsflash about a power that's dangerous
How do we escape these brainless acts of terror
I'd tell you now, if Jesus ever comes, it'll not be better
Put our hearts in the right place
Humans of all colors
We stand up as one race, I promise you, one day
Imagine that

[John Lennon]
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

[Hook: John Legend]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

[Rap Verse 2: Pitbull]
America, the
Land of the free
America, the
Land of opportunity
America
What's the point of having a Statue Of Liberty
If you turnin' refugees, back at sea
Music was made to move them
Even the devil he dances
I got a lot of questions
And I'm searching for answers
We taught to believe in religion, but religion's
The reason the Twin Towers are missin'
Listen
That was the past, but maybe now, you realize
The man above us the only thing
That keeps us alive
We breathe the same air
We bleed the same blood
Imagine our people treated equal, imagine one love (One love)

[John Lennon]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

[Repeat Hook]
