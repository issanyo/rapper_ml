[Hook: Machel Montano]
It's alright, you walked up on back of me and it's so tight
No space to move up in here but the vibes nice
We don't really care what nobody say
We come to ride my jeep, we come to break away
[i]It's alright, I've been watching you, baby, all night
The way you move your body is so right
And I just want to say
Hey, hey, baby, what's your name?
Hey, hey, baby, what's your name?[i]

[Bridge: Pitbull]
It's alright, it's okay
We gon' party all night and drink all day
It's alright, it's okay
We gon' party all night and drink all day

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Pit and Machel came to take over the world
If you don't believe me just watch us
God bless Haiti and just like Haitians
It takes more than earthquakes to stop us
What don't kill you make you stronger
And there's nothing that can feed this hunger
We gon' keep coming with the heat
Skippity do wop and flip the beat
Pit got this, watch this, you sound monotonous
Stop this, I already told you, not this
Hey Miss, you me, me you
You and I tonight, alright?

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: Machel Montano]
Shake up your body now it's alright
Wind up your body 'cause it's okay
Jump up and down and do what you like
Work up yourself and go crazy
Drink what we want and do it all night
Party don't stop 'til the break of day
Pump up the music, turn up the lights
Swing it, don't stop until we say
Girl get fine and wind up your bomba
Boy, wind up like you don't care
Back in time, now rev up the bomba
Love, all the man, them balling

[Hook + Bridge]
