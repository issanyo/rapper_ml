[Intro: Pitbull]
They didn't believe me
Now they gotta see me
As a matter fact, now they wanna be me
Mr. Worldwide and Ke$ha
Boys looking like mustard
But they better catch up

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a what 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Verse 1: Ke$ha]
I see ya in the club showing Ke$ha love
Ain't trippin' on them them them that be hatin'
Catch a dub, chuck a deuces
Y'all hatin's useless
It's such a nuisance
Y'all chickens keep your two cents
And keep your dollars, keep your loot
I'm fresher than that Gucci
Them boys, they want my coochie
I say "Nope, I'm no hoochie"
Your homegirl hatin'
I say "Who she?"
Ke$ha don't give two what's
I came to start the ruckus
And ya wanna party with us
Cause we crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a what 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Don't you know I'm loco?
I'm just a little bit crazy
13, I had a psychiatrist
But that ain't faze me
I get loose and screwed
What that mean, I got a couple screws loose?
If that's the case, then so be it
I've done it, I've seen it, cubanito
I say it, I mean, latino
I live it, I breathe it, 305
I love it, I bleed it, that's right
Now, n-n-now let's get it
I've earned so much credit
I could pay the global debt
Don't believe me? Bet it

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a what 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Bridge: Ke$ha]
This is all we've got and then it's gone
You call us the crazy ones
But we gon' keep on dancing till the dawn
Cause you know the party never ends
And tomorrow we gonna do it again
We the ones that play hard
We live hard, we love hard
We light up the dark

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a what 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people
