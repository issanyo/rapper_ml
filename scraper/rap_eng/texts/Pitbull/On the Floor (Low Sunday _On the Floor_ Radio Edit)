[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
(Hey)
Let me introduce you to my party people in the club (Hey)
Dale

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull & Both]
If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor (Hey)
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah, we work on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up (Woo!)
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor (Hey)
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa (Ah)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Dance the night away
Dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance..
Así mismo, así me gusta
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Woo!)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Let's rock)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull & Both]
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor (Hey)
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor (Yeah)
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up (Woo!)
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor (Hey)
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I am not wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa (Dale)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Dance the night away
Dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Let's rock)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Woo!)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Dance the night away (Woo)
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Dance the night away
Dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance... (Woo)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Let's rock)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Woo!)
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
