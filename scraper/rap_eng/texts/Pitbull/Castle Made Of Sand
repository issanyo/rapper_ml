[Chours: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'd sacrifice my life to give you my life through speakers
I try to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus
God knows I got a good heart
But my blood's filled with demons, I'm fighting myself, hah
Believe me I'm far from lingering, far from ready if you
Knew where I come from, knew what I've been through
You'd think there should have been another outcome
Just like most kids a father, I did it without one
Come from the city where they'll X you like Malcolm
Then you wonder how come, I can move in a room full of wolves so swift so smooth
Thank you, Mom, for making me a man
Let a motherfucker knock down my castle out of sand

[Chours: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand
Reach for my hand

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I lived my whole life with the world on my shoulders
So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us
I see them looking for the keys but they won't find them
I come from struggle, I'm a fighter, must she be reminded?
My mothers past has her trapped, has her blinded
But I took her past, I took her pain
I made it strength, I fought the game
Do or die, Pitbull's the name
Now all I see is the future, Mom I love you, I salute ya'
And no matter what happens, just know you're the reason that I'm rapping

[Chours: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand
Reach for my hand

[Verse 3: Jamie Drastik]
Look..
I'm from the home of the spinners, the winners, the big apple
Came down at south beach to build a new castle
Everyday I'm hustelin' and everyday you hassle
Doin' what you can and I'm doing what I have to
Throw me in the jungle and Imma' show you I'm a winna'
I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
I did it for my town to show em' the big picture
Pit, hit the swich I promise I'll never switch up
This is for my brother two three who went to jail
I'm sending all the pictures of my shows through the mail
He hit me with a letter, said "I knew you'd never fail"
So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail

[Chours: Kelly Rowland]
So you tried to believe in the castle made of sand
When it falls to the sea
And your feet can't find dry land, reach for my hand
Reach for my hand
