[Intro: Pitbull]
I used to hang around in boys
That took over towns and made the block blow up
Now I hang around with boys
Who take over companies and make the stock blow up
Haters, Plenty
Women, Plenty
But the world is ma cherie

[Hook]
We are gonna dance into the sea
All i want is you you're ma cherie
Never seen a girl that so Jolie
All i want is you, you're ma Cherie
Ma Cherie ooh

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
First dealing drugs was the plan
Now I'm a marquee brand
Doing business with marquee brands
No more Section 8
Now it's private yachts, beaches, sands
World tours with press and prestigious fans
Just to meet and greet me, damn
Long way from the Miami I was raised in
Long way from that foster home
Long way from that Georgia basement
Long way from all the schools that I was placed in, ha
As long as you work hard and believe
That everything happens for a reason
That's why the world is my ch√©rie, believe it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: DJ Antoine]
We don't need to run or hide
I'll be there to hold you tight
You and me we are on fire
Ma Cherie you're my desire

[Hook]

[Outro: DJ Antoine]
I will take you higher
I will take you higher
I will take you higher
You're ma love, You're ma Cherie
