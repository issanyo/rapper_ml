[Intro: Pitbull]
She sexy, fine, sophisticated and you know she rolling with me
It's B–O-N, Armando Bon, but if you act right I'll give you the D

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
If you'll be my lover
Trust me you'll discover
Something you'll remember
I could educate you babe

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Baby let me educate ya
I'm freaky, dirty, nasty by nature
Looking for some magic, I'll take ya
So sit back, relax and let me lick ya
I was raised by 2LiveCrew, so just imagine what I do
If you got into the position while I'm whispering
You listen to every little thing I wanna do to you
Pull a little hair, smack a little ooh
You know what it is, you know what it do
You got a couple friends, bring them too
Tonight it's all on you

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
All I know is, there's no point in talking 'bout body 101
All I know is, I'm just gonna show you now what your body wants
If you'll be my lover
Trust me you'll discover
Something you'll remember
I could educate ya 
Be my lover, trust me you'll discover (brains)
Something you remember
I could educate you babe

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
On the stage with Sofia Vergara
You can hate me but respect me you gotta
I see the game from the different perspective
I own, they play, bottom line they act
I'm in the zone man, self made, self paid, I'm my own man
I'm the type to take you round the world in a G4 girl
I don't play no games I'm a grown man
I wanna pull a little hair, smack a little ooh
You know what it is, you know what it do
You got a couple friends, bring them too
Tonight it's all on you

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
All I know is, there's no point in talking 'bout body 101
All I know is, I'm just gonna show you now what your body wants
If you'll be my lover
Trust me you'll discover
Something you'll remember
I could educate ya
Be my lover, trust me you'll discover (brains)
Something you'll remember
I could educate you babe

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Shake a little, dance a little, make a little love
Shake a little, dance a little, make a little love
I could educate you babe
People, lover, trust me you'll discover something you will remember
Steady under me
People, lover, trust me you'll discover something you will remember
Starting under me

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
There's no point in talking bout body 101
All I know is, I'm just gonna show you now, what your body wants
If you'll be my lover
Trust me you'll discover
Something you'll remember
I could educate ya
Be my lover, trust me you'll discover (brains)
Something you'll remember
I could educate ya
Be my lover
Trust me you'll discover
Something you'll remember
I could educate ya
Be my lover, trust me you'll discover (brains)
Something you'll remember
I could educate you babe
I could educate ya
