[Pitbull]
{*Pitbull screams*}
Yeah
Looking for a freak
Looking for a freak
Looking for a freak
Looking for a freak
Looking for a freak

Chorus: Play-N-Skillz
One
On one
We'll be having some fun
In my bedroom, all day
And all of the night
You
And you
Can bring your whole crew
To my bedroom, all day
And all of the night

Hook:
[Play-N-Skillz] If you left your at home
[Pitbull]       Get-get-get, get, get, get freaky
[Play-N-Skillz] Get two shots of the Patron
[Pitbull]       Get-get-get, get, get, get freaky
[Play-N-Skillz] If you got your favorite thong's on
[Pitbull]       Get-get-get, get, get, get freaky
[Play-N-Skillz] We gon' party til the mornin'
[Pitbull]       Get-get-get, get, get, get freaky

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Thank God that the world
Has so many freaks
That know how to wild out
And if they got a man on the low
Best believe that they pose
And they know how to hide out
Everybody wanna freak the freak wit
Pitbull's the Latin
Version of Freaknik
So
Dale loca y abre la boca
You know what to do
They're ain't no rules
In the freak game
If you like your hair pulled
And your ass slapped, better hit it from the back
Let it be known
All my mamas that think they too fit to get freaky
Y'all better be gone
But see, to play this game
Y'all gotta Pl-Play with Skillz
It's that little chico, Pitbull
From the bottom
With them boys, Play-N-Skillz
Encouraging all the freaks
To get out and get, get, get, get freaky
I'm a hundred percent freak
Just lookin' for a freak that can get with me

[Pitbull]
Como (Como)
Como
Get-get-get, get, get, get, get, get, get
Get, get, get, get freaky

Repeat Chorus & Hook

[Verse 2: Play]
You don't give a damn that your man's in love with you
You be thinking 'bout me when he fucking you
I got plans if it lands at the W
So just lose your dude, so we could rendez-vous
Come on, little mama, let me see what you got
Turn around, baby, let me hit the spot
Never lick the spot, but I'm a make it hot
Go ahead and take it off, you might sweat a lot
All I need is just a couple of minutes
But you ain't gon' trip that I'm already finished
Yes, I'm ready, get all up in it
Hit it real steady til I'm almost finished
Head back from the batch, you could feel it in the middle
Bring it back, make it clap, might slap a little
We can do it one on one, little privacy
But it's gotta be my way, girl, promise me

Pre-Chorus:
[Play]    Face down
Ass up
That's the way I like to fuck
We don't need no room
We can take it to the truck (I guaruntee)
Sweet Dreams, if you fuck with me
Leave your man, come with me so we can
[Pitbull] Get-get-get, get, get, get freaky

Repeat Chorus & Hook

[Verse 3: Skillz]
Sweet Dreams are made of these
Leave your man and come with me
It's whatever
You wanna do
Hit it from the back til we both get through
Get, get, Give It All You Got
Go to the room
Go to the car
I don't give a fuck
I'm a superstar
I still go hard
Never go wrong
Come to the bar, the Patron's on me
After the club, we can go to my suite
One on one, we could have some fun
Bring a friend
Twice the fun
I'll bring my friends, you bring your friends
We can be friends
I bring super skills
More role boss insane

Repeat Chorus & Hook
