I ain't gotta wear 2-3, to ball like 2-3
I'm in the zone dog, uh 2-3
Pour the vodka, roll the oolie
I'm always with women, about 2 or 3
All of 'em bad, never ugly
Rest of 'em are me and Uly
My flow fire, call a uzi
Now I sell records not o.z.'s
I'm on foo, ya'll are on E
I'm so fool, that's the streets
I'm so cool with no ice
Words of advice, watch your wifey
I'm on that vodka
I'm a dog on the bottle of that Hen (bottle of that Hen)
Everybody gotta cut
But they ain't chipped in (chipped in)
That's why
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Now you see it, now you don't
Baby let me see ya

Come on shake that ass for me girl (baby let me see ya)
Shake, shake for me
Come on shake shake shake for me girl (baby let me see ya)
Crap it up take it down
Let me see ya to the ground (baby let me see ya)

Honorebel, Pitbull, Jump Smokers
To the world

[Jump Smokers]
It's that Jump Smokers sound
To make the girls get down
It's Mr. 305 hooking up with guys out of Chi-town (yeah)
Latinas all around
DJ's spin this record round
Let 'em shake their ass out on the floor
Then do that Doo Doo Brown
Hey

[Honorebel]
All these girls on my planet
Orbit shake it and drop it
Love when you wine upon it
Black, white girls and Hispanic
Ladies you look exotic
In this club causing traffic
Work that pole like hydraulics
You know you're supersonic
I make your friend
[?]
This one a million seller
Honorebel, Pitbull are not a girls umbrella (hey)
