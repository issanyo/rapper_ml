Hey baby girl what you doing tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store (hey, hey baby)
You're giving it your all when you're dancing on me
I want to see if you can give me some more (hey, hey baby)
You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want (hey, hey baby)
Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back and the front (hey, hey baby)

(Get on whatever you like)
Ooh you got it, cause you make me wanna say hey baby
(You're the one I want)
Yeah don't stop it, cause you make me wanna say

I'm a Dade County, self paid, self-made millionaire
I used to play around the world
Now I'm around the world getting paid
Girl problems, no problems
Don't hate the game cause that won't solve it
I want to get with you mami
Now let me see where the Lord split you
Dale!
