[Chorus: Usher & *Pitbull*]
The party ain't over *Polow*
The party ain't over *bet that up boy*
The party ain't over (it's Mr. WW) (Mr. Worldwide)
It's 3 A.M. and (it's Usher baby)
There's too many women (Usher)
And she's just beginning (Usher)
The time of her life (muchas gracias papito)
So tell the DJ-J-J-J-J (let me show you how to do it)
Turn this motherfucker up up up up up (turn it up)

Pour me another cup cup cup cup cup (so many women in here)
Get fucked up!

[Pitbull]
From the MIA to the ATL, to the world, Dale
Party ain't over till the fat lady sing
Or should I say, party ain't over till you so fucking drunk
That that fat lady sting, dale [?] Que rica
Catch me like in a fool and a donkey
All in one, in regatta
Yeah they hot, yeah they fire
But even the devil knows I'm hotter
Ay, dios
See me, yeah 3D, yeah, yeah, with no glasses
Tell the pope to come see me

Especially when it's for Sharon and Karen
Especially when it's for Sharon and Karen

Juggle women but I'm far from a clown
In doubles and triples I'm knocking 'em down
So watch who you bring around
Cause next thing you know, I'm turning her out
Assy, to classy, but fuck it, I'm still nasty
I'm like Moses, I split the red sea
Baby if you ask me
Oye mamita, ven pa'ca
Dale mamita, dale marcha atras
Que te tengo la croqueta bien prepara
Pepe Billete, ah!
I ain't greedy, sharing is caring
Especially when it's for Sharon and Karen
Especially when it's for Sharon and Karen
Que rico
