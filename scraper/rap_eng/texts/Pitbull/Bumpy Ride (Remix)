[Hook: Machel Montano] (x3)
I wanna boom bang bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl let me rock you, rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
The world is ours now
It's Mr. Worldwide, yeah you know the drill
Everything's European, when I grab the wheel
I'm from the city where banana clips will lead you
Banana split, but I'm passed that
Bring that ass back
It's all about the gold, I'm taking over like Alexander the Great
Cities, countries, the states from the Mediterranean sea (?)
You are my heart mama, hurry up and wait

[Verse 2: Mohombi]
I wanna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine (eee ooo)
Girl you can make me suffer, do whatever
Cuz I know you're one of a kind (eee ooo)
Tell me who can love you, (nobody)
Hold you, (nobody)
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me
Who can love you, (nobody)
Hold you, (nobody)
Make your body whine, like me
You will never find someone like me

[Hook] (x2)
I wanna boom bang bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl let me rock you rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)

[Verse 3:Pitbull]
Yeah, I'm back baby
I know you think you're all that baby
But damn, that ass fat baby
I ain't gon' lie, now look at me in my eyes
Listen when I tell you, my woman's a ride or die
It's only a time to play, ain't no time to waste
No Twitter, no Facebook, mass tweets
Tu eres mujer hecha e recha
(?) dale mama echa
I'm on top of my love game and you're gonna get it tonight
I'm focused, I'm ready, girl I'm gonna give it to you right
I'm gonna pull you over, pull you under
Make your body surrender to mine
Girl you can make me suffer, do whatever
Cuz I know you're one of a kind (eee ooo)

[Chorus x2]
I wanna boom bang bang with your body-o
We're gonna rough it up before we take it slow
Girl let me rock you rock you like a rodeo
(It's gonna be a bumpy ride)
