[Chorus - Taio Cruz]
There she goes, looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes, like a shooting star
Make you wanna play, makes all the boys them say

[Pitbull]
RedOne, Taio Cruz, Mr. Worldwide

[Verse 1 - Taio Cruz]
Yeah, the way her body moving like a hurricane
Thought I knew what sexy was
But uh, uh, that just changed
She's a pop star, rock star
Fighter, lover
She knows exactly what she's doing
I think she's a pro
When she's walking to the room
She make sure that she know
She's a thriller, killer
Dancefloor filler

[Chorus - Taio Cruz]
There she goes, looking like a star
With her body shaped like a rock guitar
There she goes, like a shooting star
Make you wanna play, makes all the boys them say

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
Yeah she'll grab you by the hair
And make you scream and shout
She'd like to chew you up
And then she'll spit you out
She's a pop star, rock star
Fighter, lover
No don't think that girl a lighter
She don't give a what
Yeah, she likes to play with fire
And she burns it up
She's a thriller, killer
Dancefloor, filler

(Chorus)
There She Goes oh oh oh oh oh...

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
WOOHOO!!!
You know the rule of the game
Mo money, Mo leaches
And they'll rob you like Pharaos in Egypt
The these boys done parapelegic
Cause they don't know, Pit is very prestigious
Me and this Woman, got telekinesis
I just look and they go
Look at them move, Look at them shake
Look at they features, beautiful creatures
And make love to them
On beautiful beaches
I'm ready for the world
But the world ain't ready for me
Patience is a virtue, wait and see
Don't believe? Ay baby
Ven pa darte coquita en tu ke ke
Don't you act like you don't know
What I'm talking about
And your friends
Who cares
What they talking about
She can play goalie
But with a little bit of Voli
She gonna let me score, fo sho

[Hook]
