[Music Video Intro: Pitbull]
This is my house
I can't hear you!
Go!

[Hook: All Talent]
Gimme the green slime
'Cause that's what we're here for
It's almost game time
(Let's go!)
'Cause we're at Kid's Choice Sports, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Gimme the green slime

[Verse 1: Ricardo]
We're at Kid's Choice Sports
Yeah, you know what that means
All the biggest superstars will be covered in green
Gonna make 'em
(Woo!)
Like you never seen
These crazy competitions'll be getting extreme

[Verse 2: Jade]
We've got power players
All getting cray
Steph Curry with the sprayer
Can't look away

[Verse 3: Lizzy]
Three kids will say a prayer
For 50K and living the dream
Once we bring on the green

[Verse 4: Benjamin]
It's prime time up in here
Gronk made the climb up in here
Stars stick their faces into key lime up in here
We got all the biggest legends covered
Up in gold slime up in here

[Verse 5: Cree]
Here's the game
Now we got the right place and the right slime
We got Russell Wilson hosting for the third time
It's set up to leave it on the court
Yeah, this is how we roll at Kid's Choice Sports

[Refrain: All Talent]
Green slime, gold slime
Everybody take a shot
Green slime, gold slime
Give it everything you got

[Hook 2: All Talent]
Gimme the green slime
'Cause that's what we're here for
It's almost game time
(Let's go!)
'Cause we're at Kid's Choice Sports, oh, oh
On Nickelodeo-deo-deo-deon, oh, oh
Gimme the green slime
