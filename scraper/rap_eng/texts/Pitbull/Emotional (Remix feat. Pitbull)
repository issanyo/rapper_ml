[Pitbull:]
I'm feeling so emotional
'Cause I'm no longer close to you
Tell me what am I suppose to do
It was all about you
Till the point

New Year's
I'd toast to you
Everything I did
I did for you, baby

I'd lie for you
I'd kill for you
I'd die for you
I'd ride for you

Now you're holding hands
With another man
Making love to you

I'm feelin foolish
Looking at your picture
Drinking liquor
Thinking how can we do this

Haters and intruders are the reason
That we are no longer together
Now my heart's like a cooler ice cold
But the pain still burns

It's true
Time heals are wounds
You live and learn
But karma's a bitch
And baby you'll get your turn

[Verse 1:]
Damn
Somebody tell me why
The first girl I see
When I walk up in the club
Her nigga
You told me that you was gon make sure
I wasn't gonna see this girl

No, no tonight
I wanted to give it time
I wanted her out of my mind
Now it's too late to leave

Damn
I wonder who is that she's talking to
He put the drink down
Now he's making a move

I wonder where they movin' to
And just like a fool
I'm watching her
Tryna make eyes deter

But I can't stop watching
(I'm watching)
Said I can't stop watching
(I'm watching)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Now the only thing I feel
Inside of my chest
Is all this regret

I never should've let you go
Why'd I let you go?
This situation is under my skin
There's a war going on within

[Chorus:]
This is how I feel
Every time I'm around you
I just lose control
When I'm in the same room

I get so
I'm so
Emotional (emotional, emotional)

[Verse 2:]
So what do you think?
Should I roll up
Like I do it on dubs

Show her what it is
Make her miss my love
Yeah, reminisce on us

Look at me stressing
So caught up
Learning my lesson
I realize

But now it's too late
Cause he just wrapped his hands
Around that slim waist

That's my waist
Please don't tell me she's dancing
The same way

Man, that could never be
That's what she said to me
That's why it's so hard to believe

[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Hey, girl
Didn't see you standing there
It's been a long time
It's feeling really good
To see your smile

Every once in a while
I'm thinking of you and me
But life is good
I'm free, yeah

Wait, baby
I'm fronting honestly
I made a big mistake
I'm struggling with reality
It hurts more every day

I been blaming you
For making me feel this way
And now I'm crushed without your love

[Repeat Chorus:]
