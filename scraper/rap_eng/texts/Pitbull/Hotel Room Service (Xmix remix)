I want everybody to stop what they’re doin' (Mr. 305)
Now if you know you're with somebody
You're gonna take the hotel room tonight
Make some noise (woo)

Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room

We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

She like that freaky stuff
Two in the "O" and one in the eye
That kinky stuff, you nasty
But I like your type
And like T.I., it's whatever you like

Bring your girls, just whatever the night
Your man just left, I’m the plumber tonight
I'll check yo' pipes, oh you the healthy type
Well, here goes some egg whites

Now gimme that sweet
That nasty, that Gucci stuff
Let me tell you what we gon’ do
Two plus two, I’m gon' undress you

Then we’re gonna go three and three
You gon’ undress me
Then we’re gonna go four and four
We gon’ freak some more, but first...

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends

After party in hotel lobby
Then we off to the room like vroom
Put them fingers in yo' mouth, or open up yo' blouse
And pull that g-string down south

Ooh, okay shawty, one’s company
Two’s a crowd and three’s a party
Your girl ain’t with it, I got somebody
In my nature, she’s naughty

Now gimme that sweet
That nasty, that Gucci stuff
Let me tell you what we gon’ do
Two plus two, I’m gon' undress you

Then we’re gonna go three and three
You gon’ undress me
Then we’re gonna go four and four
We gon’ freak some more, but first...
