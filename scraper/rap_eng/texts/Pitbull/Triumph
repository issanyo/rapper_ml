[Intro: Pitbull]
Drop!
They thought it was done dawg!
But he's back bigger, better, stronger, and free!
Like I ain't fought my way off these motherfucking situations
Trust this!


[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm here to remind you, just in case you forgot
Mr. 305, no label stay hot
38 choppers, but please no Glock
Used to move work but had no trap no block no spot
Ma was cool with the work, but no rocks
Until she found my first nickel ruff bag
Said "I had enough of this shit with your dad"
So she told me to get the fuck out the pad
I was out to my first baby mama's crib
Caught her fuckin' round, off to abuela's crib
Thank god for music my savior
That's what helped me fight Xavier
Don't believe these rappers and what they play ya
I wanna be owner, fuck a playa
Shit, better say it
I am an owner, bitch!

[Bridge: Avery Storm]
I got the city on my back and I won't surrender
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember
City on my back and I won't surrender
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember
They don't know (what I got into)
They don't know (everything I been through)
They don't know (what it takes to get through)
They don't know, they don't know

[Hook: Pitbull]
My life, pain
Struggle, hustle, grind
Them boys knock me down
You must be out yo fuckin' mind
My mom taught me to fight
Dade County raised me right
And we gon' take over this thing
Put down my fuckin' life

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Don't call it a come back, I've been here for years
Grindin' blood, sweat & tears
I done gave the game my life
I've turned the streets from my bitch to my wife
Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit
Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit
Them boys in the streets on that hate shit
Them boys on the same street, same block doin' that same shit
Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls
Y'all want me, I hate y'all but I ate y'all
Y'all can stay gorillas & apes
I'm on my way to the show, gettin' paid, marvelous rates
You the ace I'm the spade
Cut cut Dade, where they buck buck spray
This ain't a duck duck goose
This duck duck hey, press luck get duct taped ASAP okay!

[Bridge: Avery Storm]
I got the city on my back and I won't surrender
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember
City on my back and I won't surrender
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember
They don't know (what I got into)
They don't know (everything I been through)
They don't know (what it takes to get through)
They don't know, they don't know

[Hook: Pitbull]
My life, pain
Struggle, hustle, grind
Them boys knock me down
You must be out yo fuckin' mind
My mom taught me to fight
Dade County raised me right
And we gon' take over this thing
Put down my fuckin' life

[Outro: Avery Storm]
Now you can stack the world against me
Close the doors, I can't come in
You could bet your life against me
Bet your ass I'm gonna win
You take that chance, you roll them dice
I prove you wrong, you prove me right
So damn what they say anywayyyy
