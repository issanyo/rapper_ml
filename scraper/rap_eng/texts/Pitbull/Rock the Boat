Yeah!

We gonna rock the boat
Rock the boat
We gonna rock the boat
Rock it til it breaks down
Rock the boat
Bring it through the underground

Yeah
It's Mr Worldwide, yeah I'm marvelous
I'm so hot, I'm hotter than lava is
I don't know what you're thinkin
But I hope you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
Won't you show head bobblin'
Don't knock on doors
But Jehovah's my witness
And I treat sex like it's psychical fitness
Up and down like the stock market
Now baby let me give you the business
Cara linda, pecho hecho
Ay que rico, dale chica
Pelo lacio, mira eso
Dale loca, dame un beso


We're gonna rock the boat
Rock it til it breaks down
Rock the boat
Hop it til it can't be found
Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping
Rockin' rockin', keep on poppin'
Rock the boat
Bring it through the underground
Ohhh
Clap your hands, hands, hands, hands
Ohhh
Clap your hands, hands, hands, hands
Ohhh
Clap your hands, hands, hands, hands
Let's go!


Tonight I'm thirsty
And I'm drinking like a grizzly bear
Cause I'm on fire like a chilli super that you can stare
I got a lighting ball in my hair
Let's party dirty all the way my dear

We're gonna rock the boat
(Baby you gon' see you'll be riden with me)
Rock the boat
(Baby you gon' see you'll be rolling with me)
We're gonna rock the boat
(Baby you gon' see you'll be rocking with me)
Rock the boat
(You gon' be rocking and rolling with me)


We're gonna rock the boat
Rock it til it breaks down
Rock the boat, hop it til it can't be found
Keep on rockin' we ain't stopping
Rockin' rockin', keep on poppin'
Rock the boat
Bring it through the underground
Ohhh
Clap your hands, hands, hands, hands
Ohhh
Clap your hands, hands, hands, hands
Ohhh
Clap your hands, hands, hands, hands
Let's Go!

Fatman Scoop, Bob Sinclair
