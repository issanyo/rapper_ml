[Chorus: Pitbull]
Put your flags up in the sky (Put them in the sky) (Jogue lá no alto)
And wave them side to side (Side to side) (Lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (Show them where you're from) (We are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (One love, life)
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
When the going gets tough
The tough get going
One love, one life, one world, one fight
Whole world, one night, one place, Brazil
Everybody put your flags in the sky and do what you feel

It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
Es mi mundo, tu mundo, el mundo de nosotros
Invitamos a todo el mundo a jugar con nosotros

[Chorus: Pitbull]
Put your flags up in the sky (Put them in the sky) (Jogue lá no alto)
And wave them side to side (Side to side) (Lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (Show them where you're from) (We are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (One love, life)
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola

Jenny, dale!

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
One night, watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight, and a million eyes
Full heart's gonna work so hard
Shoot, fall, the stars
Fists raised up towards the sky
Tonight watch the world unite, world unite, world unite
For the fight, fight, fight, one night
Watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight and a million eyes
Hey, hey, hey, força, força come on sing with me
Hey, hey, hey, allez, allez come shout it out with me
Hey, hey, hey, come on now
Hey, hey, hey, come on now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Pitbull]
Put your flags up in the sky (Put them in the sky) (Jogue lá no alto)
And wave them side to side (Side to side) (Lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (Show them where you're from) (We are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (One love, life)
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola

Claudia Leitte, obrigado

[Verse 3: Claudia Leitte]
É meu, é seu
Hoje é tudo nosso
Quando chega o mundo inteiro pra jogar é pra mostrar que eu posso
Torcer, chorar, sorrir, gritar
Não importar o resultado, vamos extravasar

[Chorus: Pitbull]
Put your flags up in the sky (Put them in the sky) (Jogue lá no alto)
And wave them side to side (Side to side) (Lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from (Show them where you're from) (We are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (One love, life)
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
