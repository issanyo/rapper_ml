Hit the dance floor when you're sexy wicked*
Hit the dance floor when you're sexy wicked
Hit the dance floor when you're sexy wicked
Hit the dance floor when you're sexy

You look good, you look... you want that...
Baby,. baby come here, baby come here
Got that look on your face like you hadn't been popped in a year

... dance floor, chilling with my pockets full
Sipping on some... let me try and have a good time
... seen her rocking all alone... they stack like domino
Got me saying shawty you fine
Oh, oho, oh, oho, baby tonight you gonna feel my fire
Oh, oho, oho, oh, you got me hot burning with desire

Dance with me I told you baby, get on the floor I told you baby
Your body is calling and it got me burning up
Follow me I told you baby, to my home I told you baby
Your body is calling and it got me burning up

Baby let me release your pain
I'm a make you... rain
Let me get you some of this brain, brain
Let me see you shake, dang, dang
This is just to play with,. free... flag white I be all
If you say no I be off
Baby it's nothing, believe me

... yes indeed I greet them, need them, breathe them, read them
Pimping ain't easy...

Dance with me I told you baby, get on the floor I told you baby
Your body is calling and it got me burning up
Follow me I told you baby, to my home I told you baby
Your body is calling and it got me burning up

Baby gonna be tonight...
... get you...
Girl I wanna put you on, you already know me...
Oh, oho, oho, oh baby tonight you gonna feel my fire
You got me hot burning with desire

Dance with me I told you baby, get on the floor I told you baby
Your body is calling and it got me burning up
Follow me I told you baby, to my home I told you baby
Your body is calling anytime it's burning up
