[Intro - Pitbull]
Hey Lil’ Jon, know we tell these boys
When they campin' out with the blunt, right?
We tell ‘em puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass

[Hook - Pitbull]
I smell that sticky icky
Who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky icky
Who got that sticky icky?
I got that sticky icky, icky, icky
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? I do
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? Me too
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? I do
I smell that sticky, oh yeah
Who got that sticky? Me too

[Verse 1 - Pitbull]
You know the drill, break it up, break it up
You know the drill, roll it up, roll it up
You know the drill, light it up, light it up
You know the drill, smoke it up, smoke it up
Now, puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
You fuckin’ up the rotation, that thang there burnin’ fast
This ain't a joke, stop playin’, I need to smoke
This thang can get dirty and I ain't talkin’ ‘bout sprinklin’ coke
I need that sticky icky, that Miami crippy
That Washington high purple, watch out that thang will hurt you
I need that Cali chronic, damn, a chico on it
Some of that Seattle supersonic
Will have you like Nevada want it fucked up
That’s right high as a kite
Now roll the next one and pass me the light
‘Cause we ready for sure
Ready to go. Ready to blow, let's roll

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Jim Jones]
If thirty's the new twenty, Patron's the new Henney
Rollin' in new Bentleys, blowin’ like two twenty
That ain't the price of the car
Now that's a half ounce of piff, dawg
You gotta have a strong chest just to hit the raw
Or you'll be coughin’ up a lung
Harlem, where we from so of course we gettin’ drugs (twisted)
We hit the parties, poppin’ bottles just for fun
Smokin’ weed in your club, call the coppers, let ‘em come
Miami, Trey O Five, we cop it out the grovehouse
A generator so the lights don't go out
A big profit in that greenery
We not stoppin’ by the beach just for scenery
When here it's 45, up here it's 65
Meet you in Carolina, get it for 55 (We got them pounds, nigga)
‘Cause everyday we hustlin’
It's heavy cake and druggin’ it
So heavyweight we smuggle it

[Hook]

[Outro - Pitbull]
Puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
Puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
Puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
Puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
I said puff, puff, pass with your pussy ass
