Pitbull
Me not working hard?
Yeah right picture that with a Kodak
Or better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak

Took my life from negative to positive
I just want y'all to know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, that's right

Ne-Yo
Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Nayer
Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Ne-Yo
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)

Pitbull
Take advantage of tonight
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless

It's insane the way the name growin' money keep flowin'
Hustlers move in silence so I'm tip-toein' to keep blowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my life baby
I'll make you feel right baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I promise tonight... dale!

Excuse me
If I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby, I'mma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

Ne-Yo
Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Nayer
Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Ne-Yo
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)

Pitbull
Reach for the stars
And if you don't grab 'em at least you'll fall on top of the world
Thank about it 'cause if you slip
I'm gon' fall on top of your girl (ha ha)

What I'm involved in is deeper than the Mason's
Baby baby, and it ain't no secret
My family's from Cuba
But I'm an American Idol gettin' money like Seacrest

Put it on my life baby
I'll make you feel right baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I promise tonight... dale!

Excuse me
If I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And baby I'mma make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow

Ne-Yo
Tonight I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Nayer
Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (let's do it tonight)
I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight

Ne-Yo
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
Give me everything tonight (hey)
