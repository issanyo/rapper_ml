[Verse 1: J Balvin]
I'm here like for one night
So we don't gotta waste time
I know that you feel it
My hands upon your waistline
So won't you, come closer
Let me know you're all mine (let me know)
Let me know you're all mine (let go)

[Pre-Chorus: J Balvin]
And I might stay tonight
But not for long
And I might say goodbye
Right now, yeah baby, right now

[Chorus: J Balvin & Camila Cabello]
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
Girl, it's getting hotter
I can't take much more
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
I need you

[Verse 2: Pitbull & Camila Cabello]
I am what they wanna be, check the stats
James Bond in the flesh, girl, that's a fact
I was raised by OGs, so I'm lowkey (uh huh)
Iâ€™m what you need in your life, baby believe me
I'm a freak that can eat, that can beat
That can treat you like that queen
That you was meant to be (Oh yeah)
I'm the good, I'm that raw, slick on the dong
With nothing to something, to had it all
Now, mami, just watch, learn and listen
I've got a feeling so good she stay switchin'
But before I banish, she spoke Spanish
She said: "Papito rico, te necesito"

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I might stay tonight
But not for long
And I might say goodbye
But right now, yeah baby, right now

[Chorus: J Balvin & Camila Cabello]
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
Girl, it's getting hotter
I can't take much more
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
I need you
I need you

[Bridge: Camila Cabello & J Balvin]
If you touch me right (If you touch me right)
I might stay the night (I might stay the night)
Oh, we can take our time (We could take our time)
I know we gotta say goodbye, (No, no, no)
I know we gotta say goodbye, (No, no, no)
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: J Balvin & Camila Cabello]
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
Girl, it's getting hotter
I can't take much more
I need you
Hey mama, hey mama, hey mama, hey ma'
I need you
I need you

[Outro: Camila Cabello]
I need you, hey!
Pa' mi gente latina, stand up!
Cuba!
I need you
