[Intro: Pitbull (x2)]
One thing's for sure
We gonna drink all night
Two things for certain
We gonna be alright

[Verse 1: Jerrod Niemann]
Dontcha look now oh the parking lots full
Gonna ride that cow with a Dallas bull
Everybody in the ATL is coming
DJs got those speakers thumping
Got a Black Ford not a White Mercedes
Walking in the front door checking out the ladies
My buddy says "hey boys, I'm buying"
The hottest girl in here's giving me the eye and

[Hook]
Everybody knows, it's gonna be one of those
I can drink to that all night
That's the stuff I like
That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
Bout to tie one on
Talking gone gone gone
Turning all the wrongs into right
I can drink to that all night

[Verse 2: Jerrod Niemann]
Workin on the sweet thing sittin' on a bar stool
Doin' shots of Jack, girl gonna take it old school
Singin' hell yeah to every song they're playing
Do ya wanna dance? Baby I'm just saying

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I can drink to that all night
Mix the Voli with the moonshine, alright
I'm a little freaky baby, I bite
Drink till I fall out, I might
You and your girl, I like
If you don't remember, it didn't happen
Could've made it in the streets
But instead I made it rapping
Mami wanna ride on the captain
Step on the gas, full steam ahead
Real-life wolf of Wallstreet, getting bread
Without the dough, but the snitching
Women switching, hit 'em and leave 'em twitching
Me, I'm on a mission
To crack a couple billion dollar companies and get missing
But today I'm gonna drink all night
Lose our morals, manners and minds, alright
Now that I like!

[Bridge: Jerrod Niemann]
I can drink to that all night
That's the stuff I like
That's the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high

[Hook]

[Outro: Jerrod Niemann]
Take your cup, fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup, fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
