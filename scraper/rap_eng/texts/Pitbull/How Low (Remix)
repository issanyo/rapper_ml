[Intro: Chuck D. sample]
How - low - can you go? How - low, can you go?
How - low - can you go? How - low, can you go?
How - low - can you go? How - low, can you go?
How - low - can you go? How - low, can you go?
[Sped up] HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Ha ha!
I'm in the zone right now baby
LUDA! Listen...

Ludacris got a remix, finna go low; hold up, let me get my camera
I wanna see Arizona, Indiana, Minnesota, and the women in Louisiana
D.C., VA, Motor City to the Lou', what it do? Finna blow like Waco
Chi-town goin' way low, both Cakalakas, Alabama to the M-I-Yayo
New York, California, Philly and they really put it on me when I'm down in Texas
Album numero siete, get ready for the Battle of the Sexes
I'm restless, tryna tell 'em that I'm hotter than the burn in the 3rd degree, gree
Then I try to tell 'em ain't nobody in the world as hot as me, me
If you really goin low, you gotta go hard
Go lower than the grades on yo report card
Gawd! Ludacris, I'm the best that ever did it, did it
And when it comes to the money I'm like "Don't stop"
(Get it, get it)

[Interlude: sped-up Chuck D. sample]
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?

See me in the A, I drop it down low

Naw, I ain't a stripper but I do it like a pro
You said this girl cain't make it bounce like this
Well, shawty I'm the shit! (yep!) Shawty, I'm the shit!
Lady in the street - you, know the rest
Put yo' money on the floor
(How high can you go)
See I got you watchin, every time I drop it
Every time I rock it's, "WHOO! - There she go"
Like you wanna marry me, like you wanna take me home
I'mma put it on ya shawty, WHOO! - Here I go
