Hello, my name is not Mr. Right
But you can be my missus tonight
I know we're only fooling around
I'm never gonna be your Mr. Right
But I'ma be your Mr. Right now

I've broken rules, I've broken laws
I've broken hearts, I've broke it all
And if you put me on baby I'll break you off
It's Mr. Todo El Mundo, take it off, haha
You know the game plan, I'm a quarter back with options
I wanna go deep, Hail Mary, amen
But tell your friend don't block us
I promise she can watch us
You know what time it is with no watches
I'm not Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right Now, baby, gracias
