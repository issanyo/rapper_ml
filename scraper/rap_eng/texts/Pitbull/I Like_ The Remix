I like how it feels

So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know
Never stop, give me more
Let's go
So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know
Never stop, give me more
Let's go
Cause I like how it feels
Give it to her like

I'ma give you what you want
I'ma give you what you need
I'ma give you what you want

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Watch how we flip this remix go
And show the world that it's number one
Another faggots, they don't believe me
But I'ma show them that I'm hotter than the sun
Baby green light you already know
Tell your girl yeah that we ready to go
Before I couldn't get one to the crib, now it's like they all just wanna go
Which y'all consider the best, I consider mediocre
I want my bank accounts, like Carlos Slims or mini Oprah
I'm drinking Voli to the time-zones, so you that it sound
Now let's make a deal, I promise you gonna like how it feels, Dale

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Fresh from Columbia still smell like Medellin
See the most straight carotene
Set them on fire, kerosene
Stevie Wonder, something they never seen
Mommy built like a horse, no jockey
I'm home, my mama little friends cocky
My women knock you out cause I'm rocky
And they all dance for pappy, ha ha
Which y'all consider the best, I consider mediocre
I want my bank accounts, like Carlos Slims or mini Oprah
I'm drinking Voli to the time-zones so you that it sounds
Now let's make a deal, I promise you gonna like how it feels

[Hook: Enrique Iglesias]
I like how it feels
I like how it feels
I like how it feels

Let's go
So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know
Never stop, give me more
Let's go
So I gotta feel you
Give it to her ...
