Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it with me)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it loud)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it louder)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
I don't care about the money, no
I don't care about the fame, no
It's all about the journey
My name is known to change presidential campaigns
From minority report, to majority in votes
From the streets to the Bahama's on a boat
Life is funny, no joke
That's why I say
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it with me)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it loud)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it louder)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
It's the invasion
You're welcome to join, if not, keep walking
The difference is
I do what I say, you boys keep talking
Chico sharp, chico smart
And pretty soon y'all gonna figure out
That chico's a shark, like Damon and Mark
That's why I say
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it with me)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it loud)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla (say it louder)
Echa pa'lla, todo lo malo echa pa'lla
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
Put your hands up in the air
Now take it low, take a step to the right, to the left one time
Everybody, pa'rriba pa'rriba

Everybody, pa'rriba pa'rriba
Everybody, get your hands up
Everybody, pa'rriba pa'rriba
Everybody, and live your life
