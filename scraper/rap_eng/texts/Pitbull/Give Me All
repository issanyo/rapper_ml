[Pitbull - Intro]
Me not working hard? Yeah right
Picture that with a Kodak
And, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
And I just want y'all know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, tell us right

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

[Hook: Nayer]
(Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love))

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Let's do it tonight

[Hook: Nayer]
(I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight)

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Take advantage of tonight
Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless
This is insane: the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin' hustlers move aside
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan
Put it on my life, baby
I'll make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight (dale)

[Pre-Hook: Pitbull]
Excuse me
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight
And, baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow


[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

[Hook: Nayer]
(Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love))

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Let's do it tonight

[Hook: Nayer]
(I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight)

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Reach for the stars, and if you don't grab them
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, cause if you slip, I'm gon' fall on top your girl
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Masons, baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
My granny's from Cuba, but I'm an American Idol getting money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby,]
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight (dale)

[Pre-Hook: Pitbull]
Excuse me
And I might drink a little more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight
And, baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight
Cause we might not get tomorrow

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

[Hook: Nayer]
(Don't care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love))

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Let's do it tonight

[Hook: Nayer]
(I want you tonight
I want you to stay
I want you tonight)

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

[Outro: Pitbull]
Excuse me
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And I think you should let me cause I look good tonight
And we might not get tomorrow
