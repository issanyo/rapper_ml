A nigga D-I-E I be forever thuggin baby
The same nigga thats why the streets still love me baby
Bitch I'm from Dade County
See Ima seven tre, chevrolet, impala, dunk rider
I blow yo doors off
You race yo car against my car, leave yo ass so far you'll doze off
And when I take off its like I took off
And when I ride by its like I fly by
Its like slow motion, or only three deep
Cuz errwhere I go they be like ya-yo!!
I fit the description, black tee and dickies
Big Glock wit me, A Dade County Nigga!

(It's dat lil chico Pitbull
I just like to welcome y'all to where I been
Born, where I been raised, the county of Dade
Ya know we got them boyz that pass by in them ol skool chevys wit the top down
Bass stay bumpin, make the trunk rattle, rearview shake
Then they Look at you with that bold smile and let you know what it is, and what it ain't)

I been born & raised in the county of Dade, land of the haze, the cocaine capital
We ain't just hitting you buddy, we Warren Sapp'n you
We coming hard like them Cubans in the 80's dogg
Go ahead throw in the pot I bet its raw
Pero ten cuidado con un tumbe porque se lo llevan todo
Llamar el babalao pregunta le por un depojo
Pero final de todo tu no puede con los lobos
Everything that I do do, everything that I say say
Everywhere that I go I let 'em know "Hey' I'm from the county of Dade"
Ol school chevy heaven, ol school niggas preachin
Young niggas wylin, getting rich off keys and violence
Trick - he's the mayor, Luke - he's the king
I'm Mr.305 put that on a triple beam
I bet it weigh out more than a boatload of keys
Holla at them Haitians, let 'em know this lick's on me, welcome to Dade

[Rick Ross]
(You See Em, You See Em, Ross, You See Em, You See Em
Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay Ay
Trick, Pitbull, DJ Khaled, 305 M-I Yayo)

I got road dawgs doing that 20 to life
You try me and I'mma get 20 tonight
You think ya bitch bad, Boy I got 20 alike
Not the car but they know I be pushin that white
Dip the chevy in syrup, digital dash
No bank accounts, my money in bags
Go do the physics, cuz when I whip it
Man I love to whip it, that's just another digit
This my city in my city you gotta tote fire
Overtown will bust yo head cuz it won't slide
Brown Sub will wet cha ass like a dunk ride
Ya dead wrong for thinking them chicos won't ride
Opa Locka revolver round that big 4-5
Them Lil Haitians will take ya ass for a boat ride
In Carol City, niggas quick to board a plane wit it
Unpack the sack and kill a gang wit it
