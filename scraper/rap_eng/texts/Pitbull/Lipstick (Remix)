[Intro: Sophia Del Carmen and *Pitbull*]
All I need to know is
Where you want my lipstick? (A-ricky-kee)
*Mr. Worldwide* (A-ricky-kee)
*Red One*
Where you want my lipstick? (A-ricky-kee)
*Sophia Del Carmen (A-ricky-kee)
*Dale!* (A-ricky-kee)

[Verse 1: Sophia Del Carmen]
Don't you wanna wake up wearing nothing but my fingerprints
You won't forget me when you sleeping with the evidence
I'll leave my traces all over your body
No hay nada mas rico que el bombon latino
Ooh la la la la la la
Ooh na na na na na
Ooh la la la la la la

[Pre-Hook: Sophia Del Carmen]
After tonight, you'll never be the same again
Once you know what it's like
You're gonna wanna do it again and again
After tonight, you'll never be the same again
Once you know what it's like
You're gonna wanna do it again and again and again

[Hook: Sophia Del Carmen]
Mama got some new tricks
Turn you on electric
All I need to know is
Where you want my lipstick
Mama got some new tricks
Turn you on electric
All I need to know is
Where you want my lipstick
A-Reeky-Kee

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I kill all the rumors on Howard Stern
I'm here to educated 'em, y'all gon' learn
Pit gets bigger as the world turns
These boys act like they got money to burn
Deep in the exhumas, all in the clouds
Fake one I'm calling 'em out
The most bad ones I'm bringin' 'em out
Hit after hit I'm bangin' them out
Sophia Del Carmen, ya tu sabes la jugada
Shake it to the South
I'm feeling like Diddy, can't stop, won't stop
Let me get a little kiss
Lipstick, red hot, that's right

[Pre Hook + Hook]

[Verse 3: Sophia Del Carmen]
My lips'll take places you ain't even dreamed to see
But if you want my love
Gotta give me everything
I'm like an army, nobody can stop me
No hay nada mas rico
Que el bombon latino

[Pre-Hook + Hook]
