[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Got that Voli in my cup
What they do that mean Wassup
All them boys they think they tough
But we know they powder puff
Actin' like they all ball
Actin' like they got gangstas on call
I know what movie they saw
That's why I can't fuck with y'all
I'm a baby from the 80's
That's why I'm a little crazy
Here's a little tip my friend
Better check check yo lady, huh
Now what y'all know about Miami
Boys coming though on verse and donks
Vega give 'em what they want
