[Verse 1]
He went from a street kid doin regular street things
Straight to a street king
Takin over the city, block by block
Breaking down bricks, servin them rock by rock
He's everything a young gun wanna grow up to be
But if only these young guns could see
That murder, money, and lust is slowly murderin' us
Cuz the drug game ain't what it used to be
So look deeper when they paint you a picture
And try to sell you a dream
Cuz a lot of these drug lords turn to the feds, or turn into fiends
The crack game ain't everything it's cracked up to be
Now that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrity
Is coppin rocks off the news kids on the block
At the same time tryna school them
But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin'
Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
And if you know this, you won't skip fame
But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power
Don't let your life go sour over power

[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

[Verse 2]
Not only did my father used to deal dope
He used to do the dope he used to deal, I'm juss' keepin it real
Now my father doesn't have shit
I don't have shit
We don't have shit
Cuz he didn't stack shit
With all the money he made, he didn't think for one second to put money away
That's cuz his mind was clouded with white thoughts
He's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalk
The only thing I can say I gained from my father is
Knowledge of the street game
And I hope that y'all follow this
I can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaine
But I can say this
Money that comes quick, leaves quick
And y'all better believe this
Cuz this I've lived and witnessed
Catch a couple of charges
Now you're on the Lord's shit list
Now you're forced to do business
Until this business does you of course
You can die doin' dope, or dealin dope, either or
You choose the road that you need to follow
And you choose the people that you look up to as role models

[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)

[Verse 3]
I know about hustler's
But I won't mention no names
Cuz they still got cases pending
And some are even, appealing, life in the cage
At least they made it past the first phase, they passed a certain age
Hustlin's like AIDS
At first your infected with HIV, and then it's full blown
Only difference is, instead of havin' no immune system
You become immune to the system of havin dough, by dealin blow
It's a fast life and even if you survive, your mind will die slow
Dirty money attracts, dirty things
And if you plan to deal dope I hope you're ready for the murder game
Cuz that's what it brings
I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryin' to preach, no
I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but yet
Like a faucet, I'm tryin' to leak
Any foe, tell these young'ns and their kinfolk
And let em' know there's more to life than a G of coke
If you used to push weight then you relate
Cuz you already had a taste of, hustler's withdrawal

[Chorus] (x2)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictive
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate (it's the hustler's withdrawal)
