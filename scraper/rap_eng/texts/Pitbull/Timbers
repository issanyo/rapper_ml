[Hook: Ke$ha & Pitbull]
It’s going down, I’m yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let’s make a night you won’t remember
I’ll be the one you won’t forget

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy’s a diggity dog
I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber
Face down, booty up, timber
That’s the way we like the what, timber
I’m slicker than an oil spill
She say she won’t, but I bet she will, timber

[Bridge x2: Pitbull]
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it’s going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it’s going down

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane
Nah, it’s just me, ain’t a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes
Blessed to say, money ain’t a thing
Club jumping like Lebron, now Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, wild, ‘cause it’s about to go down

[Bridge + Hook x2]
