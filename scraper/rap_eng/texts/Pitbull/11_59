[Intro: Vein (Pitbull)]
(Vein!)
(Someone point me to the nearest party)
Let's have some fun
I mind my business like (whistle)
Waiting for this clock to strike (whistle)
It's a celebration
Hahaha!

[Hook: Vein (& Pitbull)]
Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11:59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes twelve
(So I can) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(Everybody jump) jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump

[Verse 1: Vein]
Imma live it up
Today I don't give a what
Let me re-phrase that
Today I don't give a fuck
I just wanna jump jump like Imma dunk dunk
I'm bout to dribble all through here
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one like it's the new year
It's my day first time, I want all my shine
Even though I won't remember at all
I'll probably end up in a brawl
I'm going toe to toe with the wall

[Hook: Vein(& Pitbull)]
Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11:59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes twelve
(So I can) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(Everybody) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
We shut down Times Square, extra extra read all about it
New year, it's our year, to be clear, we here
Immigrant parents but
I'm living the American dream for them now
It's it's it's about to go down
This is for Eddie, Bobby, Rudy, Johnny
Up in the sky drinking voli lodi dodi
I don't need a Maybach or Buggati
Couple of beds with some sheets, that's a party
Go DJ, head blow the speakers
All my women wear heels, no sneakers
Grim reaper, the night is mine
Meet me at 11:59

[Hook: Vein]
Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11:59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes twelve
(So I can) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(Everybody jump) jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump

I think I'll fuck the track now

[Bridge]
(Pitbull)
I want everybody to put their glasses in the air right now
And now that you got 'em up
Now let's make a toast
[Vein (Pitbull)]
Put 'em higher now, get em so much higher for me
(Now let's make a toast)
Reach for the sky right now for it's so much higher than me

[Hook: Pitbull and Vein]
Everybody rise
I wanna make a toast to me tonight
It's 11:59
And I can't wait til the clock strikes twelve
(So I can) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(Everybody) jump jump jump jump jump jump
(I just wanna) jump jump jump jump jump jump
