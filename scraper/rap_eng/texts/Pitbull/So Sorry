[Intro:]
Wake up, motherfuckers!
And smell the Cuban coffee
Una coladita, ha, ha, ha
You ain't gotta worry about MIAMI being represented no more
'Cause it gets represented thoroughly throughout the world
By who? By yours truly
Mr. From nothing something, Let's ride

[Verse:]
I'm here now, alive in the flesh
Burning shit down like David Koresh
Except Imma walk out and wave bye to the press
Yes, you heard me correct
Pit's like the I-R-S, I'm here to collect
On taxes that bitch life owes me
Now it's time to pay back
It's either that or run in some cribs
Strapped with the K
Asking, where them K's at
I flow special, like that K
All my smokers, light that J
If you think you're that hot, hell's right this way
I see you took the first step
You already pressed play, and
That there impressed me
And I'm truly flattered, I'm truly thankful
Money I'm not worried about
Cause Imma have a bank full
I'm not trying to brag, I'm not trying to floss
But it's hard to find yourself living
In the land of the laws
A lot of these cats would sell their souls to the devil
No matter the cost, for a piece of success
Not knowing the consequences, and the constant tentions
I'm a monster playing, monster's ball
When I'm telling y'all, I'm on, ready for it all (RRR-all)

[Outro:]
So sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry and
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
