[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Fire up that loud, another round of shots
Turn Down For What
Turn Down For What
Turn Down For What
Turn Down For What
Turn Down For What

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Here’s a little Cuban from track 18
If you know the old pit then you know what I mean
There ain’t nothing in the game that I haven’t seen
And my favorite color? You guessed it money green
Miami I bleed
Miami I breed
And don’t get it fucked up, Miami is me
And until the day Cuba is free
You know me, Imma keep yelling
(Castro No, Cuba Sí)
I went from hangin' 'n' bangin'
With chico servin' 'n' slangin'
And strippers puttin’ us down
With liqs slippin' 'n' rangin'
They make it they take it
They flip it they whip it they get paid
You name it they cock it they aim it
They bangin’ the stage
Lil Jizza 'n' Luda'
Let’s do this
Let’s show the world they clueless
We got more haters than Judas
But them lil' bitches can’t fool us
Lil Jon bend that up
Let’s show the world that we don’t give a fuck
Turn down for what﻿ (Turn down for what)

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Turn down for what
Turn down for what
Turn down for what
Turn down for what

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Luda
I only for some bad bitches when the club close
Whole V.I.P. trunk full of drugged hoes
And fireworks of unlimited booze
Leave my dollars in ones, and my women in twos
Three's company, skip all the foreplay
I say, "Where you going?"; they say, "Both ways"
They might act hard (act hard), but that ass soft
Mouth magic, so I tricked off
Poof! I'm a magician and on a mission
They have the women kissin' and missin' up in the new edition
And I ain't talkin' about Rodney, Bobby, Ricky, or Mike
My Maseratis and them Bugattis by the end of the night
They say they want a cocktail with a twist in it
They like to blow black power? I put a fist in it
Ludacris, I'm a sucker for a big butt
All up in the club screaming

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Turn down for what
Turn down for what
Turn down for what
Turn down for what
Turn down for what

[Conclusion: Pitbull]
Oh hey, you heard what I say
Turn down para que, turn down para que
Oh hey, you heard what I say
Turn down para que, turn down para que
Oh hey, you heard what I say
Turn down para que, turn down para que
Oh hey, you heard what I say
Turn down para que, turn down para que
