[Intro: Pitbull]
Shake that
We're gonna shake it
From Miami to Australia
Shake That
That's Right

[Verse 1: Samantha Jade]
Tell me what you've been drinking
I can tell what you're thinking
That I'll be yours for the weekend
Honey, I gotta do it my way so
Don't rush, don't rush
Just lay low
But be ready when I say go

[Pre-Chorus: Samantha Jade]
If you just want one hit
I guarantee you'll miss
Because my heart and this
They go together
If all you want is fun
Then after that you're done
I'd rather wait for someone
Who loves me better

(Oh, ooh)
Don't talk to me (ooh)
Prove to me (ooh)
You won't only be

[Chorus: Samantha Jade]
One foot in, one foot out
Gotta step up
If you wanna get down
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
One foot in, one foot out
Better man up
If you wanna get down
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
Shake that (Ooo-oh)

[Verse 2: Samantha Jade]
I'm all about my business
Make 'em work, make 'em work
With the quickness
Girls, can I get a witness?
Honey, I ain't sayin' I'm perfect
But I know I'm deservin'
And I'm gonna make it worth it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Samantha Jade]
If you just want one hit
I guarantee you'll miss
Because my heart and this
They go together
If all you want is fun
Then after that you're done
I'd rather wait for someone
Who loves me better

(Oh, oh)
Don't talk to me (ooh)
Prove to me (ooh)
You won't only be

[Chorus: Samantha Jade]
One foot in, one foot out
Gotta step up
If you wanna get down
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
One foot in, one foot out
Better man up
If you wanna get down
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
Shake that (Ooo-oh)

[Bridge: Samantha Jade]
(Woo, ow)
(Wanna get)
(Wanna-w-wanna get down-down)
(W-wanna get down)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Shake that
I wanna see you in your birthday suit
Take that
Mami, show me where your sweet little cake at
I wanna take a little nibble or maybe a full bite
And make a full night, I roll dice and gamble
Too hot to handle
Me, I'm all ears unlike Vincent Van Gough
So tell me what you want, tell me what you need
Tell me what you like and I'll do it, do it right
Me, I'm 'bout my business
No, I'm not the mob
But your boy got a hit list
My life's my trial
Jehovah's my witness
Rewind it a couple of times
And maybe you'll get this
You need a man in your life
Them boys that you're playin' with
Ain't doing you right
Two times, say it twice
Need a man in your life
Them boys that you're playin' with
Ain't doing you right
Samantha Jade, talk to 'em

[Chorus: Samantha Jade]
One foot in, one foot out
Gotta step up
If you wanna get down
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
One foot in, one foot out
Better man up
If you wanna get down
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
Shake that (Ooo-oh)

[Chorus: Samantha Jade]
One foot in, one foot out
Gotta step up
If you wanna get down
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
One foot in, one foot out
Better man up
If you wanna get down
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
Shake that (Ooo-oh)
