[Intro]
P-p-p-p-party rock
LMFAO
Shake that
Shake that
Move that
Shake that

[Intro: LMFAO]
We like to party rock
And we came to lose control
Came to keep the party people dancing
Cause we LMFAO
Well I'm Redfoo, and I'm Sky Blu
And we brought some friends along
Young Boss, Kevin Rudolf, and Pitbull
They gon' help you sing this song

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite
I love just who you are
I ain't gon' try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

[Verse 1: David Rush]
I caught her when she fell from heaven
One to ten, baby girl's an eleven
And I ain't trying to spit no game
But I'm trying to figure out from where you came
Because a star like hers
Man, it really occurs in a world like this
Only way you ever meet a girl like this
Get up in a spaceship and take that trip
We kinda have a way with words
We even start a convo' to get at her
Every other (shake that) becomes a blur
Be my misses, I'll be your sir
I love her, the way she is
The way she are, a shooting star
And I pray that you never change
Please stay the same cause

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
I love just who you are
I ain't gonna try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

I love just who you are
I ain't gonna try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah baby girl, that's a shooting star with your name
I ain't gonna lie
I've told a lot of lies and played a lot of games
But with you it's not the same
For you, Imma ride, I want you by my side
I feel like them Geto Boys (you playing with my mind)
I'ma tell you one more time (you playing with my mind)
For you I'ma grind
You were there through the pain
You stood right by me, thanks to you I survived
I guess it's true what they say, love is blind
We together til the day that we die
Until death do us part
Baby you my heart,they can take all the houses and the cars
But they'll never take my shooting star

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
I love just who you are
I ain't gonna try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

[Bridge]
Shake that
Move that
Move that
Shake that
Shake that
Move That
Shake that

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
I love just who you are
I ain't gonna try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

I love just who you are
I ain't gonna try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

I love just who you are
I ain't gonna try to change you
You are a shooting star
That's why you are my favorite

[Outro]
Shake That
