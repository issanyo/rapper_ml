[Verse 1]
I'm looking for love, so papi bring more
To keep me moving, ole, ole
So make your sweet moves on me all night long
Hopping down, we going, ole, ole

[Pre-Chorus]
From the window to the wall to the rooftop
Roll my body to the vibe as I roll for more
Give it to me right there, don't stop
Right there, don't you let me go

So you'll be dreaming of me
Send me all your love, [?]

So come and save me, ole, ole
Just give me your love baby, on and on

From the window to the wall to the rooftop
Roll my body to the vibe as I roll for more
Give it to me right there, don't stop
Right there, don't you let me go
