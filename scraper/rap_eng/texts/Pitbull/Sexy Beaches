[Chorus: Chloe Angelides & (Pitbull)]
I wanna go somewhere exotic
Let the sun massage my body
Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I wanna jump into the deep end
Get lucky like the number 7
Treat every day like a vacation
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I wanna see (sexy beaches, hotels)
I wanna see (sexy beaches, hotels)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Little mama wanna turn it up
Little mama wanna burn it up
Little mama wanna live it up
Well, little mama better give it up
All the mamas like whoa
And the booty's like bang, bang, bang
I don't bring sand to the beach
I bring the beach to the sand

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
And I know what they want
And I know what they need
I just look'em in the eyes
And they're leaving with me
We gon' do all the wrong things
Wrong things you like
Baby, better gon' do it tonight
Let's ride

[Chorus: Chloe Angelides & (Pitbull)]
I wanna go somewhere exotic
Let the sun massage my body
Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I wanna jump into the deep end
Get lucky like the number 7
Treat every day like a vacation
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I wanna see (sexy beaches, hotels)
I wanna see (sexy beaches, hotels)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
You can't save me, babe, it's too late
I'm looking for a freak, not a soulmate
Sexy beaches, hotels, mirrors on the roof
Making more fun, ain't that the truth
Lose our morals and our minds
At the same damn time
And bring your girlfriend
Cause she's so damn fine

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull & (Chloe Angelides)]
And I know what they want
And I know what they need
I just look'em in the eyes
And they're leaving with me
We gon' do all the wrong things
Wrong things you like
(Baby, we gon' do it tonight)
Let's ride

[Chorus: Chloe Angelides & (Pitbull)]
I wanna go somewhere exotic
Let the sun massage my body
Meet a sexy stranger in the lobby
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I wanna jump into the deep end
Get lucky like the number 7
Treat every day like a vacation
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I wanna see (sexy beaches, hotels)
I wanna see (sexy beaches, hotels)

[Outro: Pitbull & Chloe Angelides]
Sexy beaches, hotels
Sexy beaches, hotels
