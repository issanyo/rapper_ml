[Bun B (Play)]
Yeah, baby
We still freakin'
Freaks, Part 2 (Play-N-Skillz)
Man, I wish they could free Pimp C, man
So we can sell all these freaks here (Pitbull, Pitbull)
It's so many in this world, baby (Bun B, Bun B)
Pick and choose (Part 2, Part 2)

[Play-N-Skillz]
REMIX!

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Bun B the B, gettin' his creep on
In the bedroom, gettin' his freak on
Twist your body, in all kind of different kind of positions
Right now, really can't speak on
But I can show you, plenty to tell ya (Tell ya)
Let it go, girl, bet I won't fail ya (Fail ya)
Make it bust until we both stop countin'
To the top of the mountain like Mahalia (Mahalia)
Like douja, let me inhale ya
Deep in the chest
Deep in the lungs (Lungs)
Sweat in sex, in between them sheets
I'm keepin' you wet
Deep and you sprung (Sprung)
And I love it when you lick me, baby (Mayne)
From my head to my feet with ya tongue (Tongue)
And right now, I ain't even scare
To say it, to make it to beat ya to one
So, don't be scared to let your hair down
Come on and take this ride
Let your inhibitions go (For real)
And release the freak inside
I could take you where you want to go (Go)
I could show you what you want to see (See)
I can give you anything you want
Let you be the freak you wanna be
Just keep dancin' like that in front of me

Chorus:
[Krayzie Bone] The world has too many freaks
[Adina Howard] I can freak you in the mornin'
Freak you in the evenin'
Freak you right now
[Krayzie Bone] The world has too many freaks
[Adina Howard] I can freak you in the mornin'
Freak you in the evenin'
Freak you right now
[Krayzie Bone] The world has too many freaks
[Adina Howard] I can freak you in the mornin'
Freak you in the evenin'
Freak you right now
[Krayzie Bone] The world has too many freaks
[Adina Howard] I can freak you in the carpet
Freak you on the table
Freak you right now, cause I can't
Wait to freak you later

[Verse 2: Play]
I still don't wanna
Could lick ya
Y'all know
Get what I want, never treat my dough
T-Town pimp, got a lot of hoes
All around the globe, in different area codes
I might stick the one, but not today
Cause I love my F-R-E-A-K
S, yes, believe I got 'em
And I got so many, you would think I bought 'em
Straight to the point, my time to clown
Let me know from the gate, if you love that sound
If so, I could turn it down (Turn it down...) {*song fades*}
Tcka-ah!
Bring it back

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Thank God that the world has so many
Freaks that know how to wild out
And if they got a man on the low, best believe
That they pose and they know how to hide out
Everybody wanna freak the freak wit
Pitbull's the Latin
Version of Freaknik
So
Dale loca y abre la boca
You know what to do
They're ain't no rules
In the freak game
If you like your hair pulled
And your ass slapped, when I hit it from the back
Let it be known
All my mamas that think they too fit to get freaky
Y'all better be gone
But see, to play this game
Y'all gotta Pl-Play with Skillz
It's that little chico, Pitbull
From the bottom
With them boys, Play-N-Skillz
Encouraging all the freaks
To get out and get, get, get, get freaky
I'm a hundred percent freak
Just lookin' for a freak that can get with me (Como!)
Yeah

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 4: Skillz]
You don't play, I'm the playa to call
23"s and the playa that balls
So many freaks, I track them haters
If boys a pimp, but not in Gators
And I'm the man in a two-man band
Got a sherrif freak when I went to Vegas
Got a Latin chick that called me papi
A black chick
That'll put it on me
Got a white chick
That'll give me brain
So good, that I swervin' lanes
You want it from the back? I could do that for ya
You want it all night? I could do that for ya
Got four or five chicks, y'all know my steez
Four, five chicks for my boy Bun B
Four, five chicks when they free Pimp C
Got five of the chicks out the 4-1-3
My pimpin' game is on another level
My watchin' game is on another bezel
From DMX, to Club Levels
At the Roxy club, they down for whatever
Cause I can freak, the freak about the freak
Then pass it to Pit so he could freak
Then pass it back, to the rest of the crew
When this how we do it on Freaks Part 2 (2...)

[Krayzie Bone]
The world has too many freaks

[Adina Howard]
Oooh
I took my t-shirt and my panies off
I want you, to freak me
In the mornin'
We can do it anyway you like
In the shower
On the counter
Every hour (Hour...)
