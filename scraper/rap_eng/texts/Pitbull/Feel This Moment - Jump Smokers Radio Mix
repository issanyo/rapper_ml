Ask for money, and get advice

Ask for advice, get money twice

I'm from the Dirty, but that chico nice

Ya'll call it a moment, I call it life

One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden

But until the gates are open

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Mr. Worldwide

Christina Aguilera

Oye mamita

I just want to feel this moment

Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo

Long way from them hard ways, filled with zoes & oye's

They count it always, 305 all day

Now baby we can parlay, or baby we can party

She reads books, especially 'bout red rooms & tie ups

I got her hooked, 'cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up

Christian Gris nice to meet ya, but time is money

Only difference is I own it, now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden

But until the gates are open

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

I see the future but live for the moment

Makes sense don't it? Ha

Now make dollars, I mean billions

I'm a genius, I mean brilliant

The streets are what schooled him

And made him slicker than slick rick the ruler

I've lost a lot and learned a lot

I'm far from cheap

I break down companies with all my peeps

Baby we can travel the world

And I can give you and all you can see

Time is money

Only difference is I own it

Like a stop watch let's stop time

And enjoy this moment, dale

One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden

But until the gates are open

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment
