[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide!
Abraham Mateo, E-40, Stereotypes that's the show
I want all the ladies out there
Go ahead and uh, shake what your mama gave ya
(One, two, three, oh)
Talk to 'em like

[Chorus: Abraham Mateo]
Ooh, girl I want you to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
What your mama gave ya (uh huh)
Come on ohh, sexy thang
Don't be scared to act like an animal
It's in your nature (uh huh)
C'mon

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You know I eat it from the roota to the toota
Let me do ya, let me school ya
He may be smooth but I'm smootha
I'm slick Pit ruler, let a slip slip through ya
Hit the Virgin Mary from the back
And had her screaming: Ha, Hallelujah!
Yeah, the devil's hot but I'm hotter
Yeah these boys rap, but they say, a whole lotta nada
Me I'm building schools, from Miami to Nevada
Now baby bend over and show me that got it
Off in the Exumas, actin' a fool
Where the water so clear, b*tch look like a pool
Whoody who, whoody what, who's f**king you
That would be me, P-I-T

[Refrain: E-40]
Now if you came with ya man, leave 'em over there
Now if you came with ya man, leave 'em over there
Yeah, it's a jungle out here (watch out)
Yeah, it's a jungle out here (watch out)
Now if you came with ya man, leave 'em over there
Now if you came with ya man, leave 'em over there
Yeah it's a jungle out here and we're bout to get it started

[Chorus: Abraham Mateo]
Ooh, girl I want you to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

[Post-Chorus: E-40]
Now we can keep it in the club, or we can leave
And if you wanna go home, then come with me
Now we can keep it in the club, or we can leave
And if you wanna go home, then come with me

[Verse 2: E-40]
Pushin' a mainly line, travel the planet solid as granite
Tax a b*tch like a W-9
Move manage, get my mathematics right
Havin' money, wearin' a hoodie when it's sunny
Huddled up in a circle, smoking a mummy
In a luxury scraper or something foreign
Ya b*tch chose me, she said you're boring
I put a b*tch on restriction, make her sit on the porch, Mayne
Won't let her in 'till tomorrow, until the next morning, Mayne
It's true that I'm chasing time can't be wastin' or delaying
My pockets anticipating lump sums
Patiently waiting for my high to come down
And get back to earth
So I can start all over like I rehearsed
Pistol-packing power clatter higher than a cell tower
In her outer space to wasted she owe me, we hella faded
Underrated honey thicker than K. Michelle hella tail
Bokey poking out, hella swell

[Refrain: E-40]
Now if you came with ya man, leave 'em over there
Now if you came with ya man, leave 'em over there
Yeah, it's a jungle out here (watch out)
Yeah, it's a jungle out here (watch out)
Now if you came with ya man, leave 'em over there
Now if you came with ya man, leave 'em over there
Yeah it's a jungle out here and we're bout to get it started
Like one, two, three!

[Chorus: Abraham Mateo]
Ooh, girl I want you to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
What your mama gave ya (uh huh)
Come on ohh, sexy thang
Don't be scared to act like an animal
It's in your nature (uh huh)
C'mon

[Post-Chorus: E-40]
Now we can keep it in the club, or we can leave
And if you wanna go home, then come with me
Now we can keep it in the club, or we can leave
And if you wanna go home, then come with me

[Outro: Pitbull]
I see them boys hatin' 'cause they all wanna be me
Naw homie you don't know me, but your girl does (ask her)
I see them boys hatin' 'cause they all wanna be me
Naw homie you don't know me, but your girl does (ask her)
