[Intro: Leona Lewis & Pitbull]
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, for you to see
(Mr. Worldwide)
I don't care what they believe we should be
(Leona Lewis)
I won't run away 'cause I can't change how I feel
This is for those that never believed in what we got goin' on
We don't have to say a single thing about you and me
(We appreciate ya'll)
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
(Sing it to 'em, Leona)
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
(Let's ride)
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I see you baby (Yeah)
I wanna feel you baby (Yeah)
Sexy to hear you baby
Just keep your lips like the Navy, and seal them baby
I live a life that movies are made of
Sex, money, power and mayhem
These boys ain't' players, they need to get their game up
They can't even hit a lay up

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Forget the Facebook, forget the Twitter
Forget the Snapchat, forget the Instagram
Baby I got a master plan
Gingerbread man, catch me if you can

[Chorus: Leona Lewis]
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Baby let's get away and enjoy paradise together
And if you understand my vision
Then we could knuckle up and take on the world together
I've lived this life forever
No one has to know how we move
No one has to know what we do
Just me and you
Just you and I
Bonnie and Clyde
Step on the gas, let's ride

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Forget the Facebook, forget the Twitter
Forget the Snapchat, forget the Instagram
Baby I got a master plan
Gingerbread man, catch me if you can

[Chorus: Leona Lewis]
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
We could be the only ones, only ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know

[Bridge: Pitbull]
They're mad
Because they can't do the things that we can
And they never been the places we've been
That's right, all they do is talk shh....
They're mad
Because they can't do the things that we can
And they never been the places we've been
That's right, all they do is talk shh....

[Chorus: Leona Lewis]
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know
We could be the only (only, only) ones to know
We could be the only (only, yeah) ones to know
We could be the only (only, only, only) ones to know
