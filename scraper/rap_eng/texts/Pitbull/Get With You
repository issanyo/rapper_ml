[Intro: Yung Jay R]
Back, back, back, back it up!
It's Jay R, straight acting up
With Pitbull, Julio G
From one glass you know wassup
I see  her looking from a mile away
Cause I be balling out like it's a holiday
Got a pocket full of that stripper money
Every chance I get paid I say

[Verse 1: Yung Jay R]
Mami what your staring for?
You wanna come with us?
Bottles full of champagne
If you tryna catch a bus
You call it love or lust
Call it anything you want
We can rain on your body
Money goes, money goes
Bankteller gonna check the funds
Back and forth like he ain't got the runs
That's here my lifestyle
Baby I do this shit for fun
Let's do this right now
Baby, I'd have you tapping out
From Bedroom, to the resting table
To living room on a couch

[Hook: Yung Jay R]
Throw your hands up in the air
Wave like you just don't care
I'm just trying to get with you
Show me what to freaking do
I ride it like a Maserati
Me in on your body
I'm just trying to get with you
Show me what to freaking do

Drop it low, touch your toes
Mami, how low can you go
The way your body moving slow
I'd be like vamonos
I just wanna take you home
So shawty let me know
I just wanna take you home
So shawty let me know
Yea- let-let me know

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Boom Boom, Get out the way
Here comes a hurricane
I don't throw my money in the air
But I make that money rain
Mami, boy that thing so fatty
Look like an orangutan
I just wanna play up in it
Get it wet and stay up in it
Hold on, wait a minute
We both for dos
Ain't no time to brainwrestle baby
It's time for that dirty talk
Wake you and your hardly walk
You need, you text me baby
Si te cojo, to mojo, te engancho, te mancho
For sure!

[Hook: Yung Jay R]

[Verse 3: Julio G]
Shawty let me know
It's Julio G back at it again
Let's take a trip through that lost lost stable
We do it big, just everyday
You know that I'm with it
Through silence, Mami I ain't here to pretend
Let me know where to begin
Cause we can get on poppin
And girl, you know we ain't stoppin
Everything's just on me
Just sit back and relax
These other dudes can't do it like me (Nah!)
They can't do it like me, come by and you'll see!
They can't do it like me, come by and you'll see!

[Hook: Yung Jay R]

[Outro: Yung Jay R]
Jay R, Julio G, y el chico, Pitbull
Latinos stand up!
Dominicanos, Mexicanos, Cubanos, Colombianos
Y'all know what it is
Put some motherfuckin bills in there!
