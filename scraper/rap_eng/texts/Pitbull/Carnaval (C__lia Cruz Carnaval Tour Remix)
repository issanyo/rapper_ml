[Chorus: Claudia Leitte]
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
Shake it and drop it, shake it and drop it
You know it's going down
Everybody dancing, everybody jumping
Let's get it started now
This is my Carnaval

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
We made history together, opened up the World Cup
We 'bout to do it again, now baby, buckle up
From Miami to Brazil
Claudia pass the torch like Olympics in Rio
Girl, you got that hmmm
Girl, you got that real
Me I got that glow
Yeah, you know the drill
Hit them with that samba, show them what it is
And after Carnaval we can all hit the crib
Obrigado, Claudia Leitte
Here we go again
Speaking to the world
Here we go again
In Carnaval
Here we go again
Now move this drop, everybody hands up

[Chorus: Claudia Leitte]
This is my carnaval aye aye aye ha
This is my carnaval aye aye aye ha
Shake it and drop it, shake it and drop it
You know it's going down
Everybody dancing, everybody jumping
Let's get it started now
This is my carnaval aye aye aye ha
This is my carnaval aye aye aye ha
Shake it and drop it, shake it and drop it
You know it's going down
Everybody dancing, everybody jumping
Let's get it started now
This is my Carnaval

[Verse 2: Claudia Leitte]
Give me rhythm, give me flow
Give it up, boy, I need some more
Take my body to the floor tonight
Touch me good, baby, come and do me right
Jiggle it and take it low
Blow the trumpets, baby, blow
We can dance until the morning light
We can do, we can do this thing for life
Samba
A little bit of rumba
With a bit of salsa
Play it over and over

[Chorus: Claudia Leitte]
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
Shake it and drop it, shake it and drop it
You know it's going down
Everybody dancing, everybody jumping
Let's get it started now
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
Shake it and drop it, shake it and drop it
You know it's going down
Everybody dancing, everybody jumping
Let's get it started now
This is my Carnaval

[Verse 3: Claudia Leitte]
Levo a bossa pra Cancún
Trago jazz pro Olodum
A luz do Farol nos leva e traz
Vou na fé, do fim nem me lembro mais
Do Ilê ao rock and roll
O trompete anunciou
Pra suar até o sol raiar
Vem com tudo que o som vai te levar
Samba
A little bit rumba
With a bit of salsa
Play it over and over

[Chorus: Claudia Leitte]
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
Shake it and drop it, shake it and drop it
You know it's going down
Everybody dancing, everybody jumping
Let's get it started now
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
This is my Carnaval aye aye aye ha
Shake it and drop it, shake it and drop it
You know it's going down
Everybody dancing everybody jumping
Let's get it started now
This is my Carnaval
