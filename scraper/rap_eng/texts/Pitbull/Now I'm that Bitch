[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. 305, putting it down with the Queen Livvi
But I ain't gonna call you Livvi
Pero, ma, mira
Why don't you let them know who you are?

[Verse 1: Livvi Franc]
Hi, my name is, you won't remember
Wait 'til December
Cause you thought that I was pure as snow
Guess you didn't know
Hold tight, surprise
Open your eyes it's springtime
Flowers blossoming, I am one of them
Bet you like how I've grown

[Refrain: Livvi Franc]
'Cause now I'm that bitch
You'll never get to...
Can't get what you want, so you're acting like a punk
You were too fly then, so fly away now
Now I'm that bitch, and you're just a clown

[Verse 2: Livvi Franc]
Why, should I even remember
Back when you blanked me
To put it frankly
But now I'm back, I'm not attracted
And you're not getting none
Cause I'm, not for the taking
I'm not a bender
Return to sender
I laugh at you
Even asking to
To get with me tonight

[Refrain: Livvi Franc]
Cause now I'm that bitch
You'll never get to...
Can't get what you want, so you're acting like a punk
You were too fly then, so fly away now
Now Im that bitch, and you're just a clown

Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
And you're just a clown
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Yeah look at me now

[Bridge: Livvi Franc]
You passed me by
Never looked twice
Now I'm the chick
You wanna be with
Isn't it so funny now
I'm the one to shut you down
Don't worry, girls, if he didn't notice you
Soon he'll be begging to

[Bridge Rap: Pitbull]
Oye, mamita
Calmate, I feel ya
We all get burned
Those who survive are the ones that learn
If it don't kill ya, it makes you stronger
Pero no te ponga como una chonga
Even though I ain't gon' lie
It turns me on a little bit when you act like a bitch
Mama, I know what you went through was hard
But the biggest bitch is karma, let her do her job (that's right)
Don't even stress these clowns
Baby you a queen, here's the crown
Enjoy yourself, you independent now (that's right)
They lose, and you winnin' now (That's right)
You're a shootin' star
Now let 'em know who you are

[Refrain: Livvi Franc]
Cause now I'm that bitch
You'll never get to uh
Can't get what you want, so you're acting like a punk
You were too fly then, so fly away now
Now I'm that bitch, and you're just a clown
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
And you're just a clown
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Now I'm that bitch
Yeah, look at me now
