[Intro: Pitbull]
This got that Scarface feel to it
Mr. Mauricio, Bobby Biscayne
Yours truly, and Austin M

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
I'm a bad boy and you liking it
(I'm a bad boy and you liking it)
You say I'm no good, but you liking it
(You say I'm no good, but you liking it)
People telling you to leave me alone
(People telling you to leave me alone)
Ain't nobody else you can't go there with
(Ain't nobody else you can't go there with)

[Verse 1: Bobby Briscayne]
Felt like Tony Montana
Say she only want sour
And I only want power
Won't stop 'til my name up on a tower
Leave me alone
Girl, I'm bad for ya, leave me alone
Only time I hit your number, was like three or four
And only thing you want to know
Is when we gon' roll (oh yeah)
Know I drive you crazy
Know I disappear up on you, baby
Know you put your heart
In trying to change me
But you could never, ever save me
Girl, you rolling with a bad boy
Hundred bands in the back, boy
She fell in love with a fat boy
And she will never, ever leave me

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
'Cause I'm a bad boy and you liking it
(I'm a bad boy and you liking it)
You say I'm no good, but you liking it
(You say I'm no good, but you liking it)
People telling you to leave me alone
(People telling you to leave me alone)
Ain't nobody else you can't go there with
(Ain't nobody else you can't go there with)

[Post-Chorus: Austin Mahone & Bobby Briscayne]
Come on
Leave me alone (she won't)
Leave me alone (she can't)
Leave me alone (she won't)
Leave me alone
Come on
Hundred on the highway
Homie, you're a Monday
I'm a Friday
Young Sinatra, get it my way
Bad boy and you liking it

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Mr. 305, to Mr. Worldwide to Mr. Take Something
Make something, that’s right
For hanging with dark goons and gangsters
To doing business with investors, attorneys and bankers
Same story, different suits
Same chico, just under a different roof
Instead of the corner of the block is the corner of the office
I’m nauseous from offers
And when I see women, it's ménages they offer
And you know that I’m all for
Especially if they’re both on our fours
And you can keep them, huh, dawg, they’re all yours
An eight figure, Dade County chico (305)
Not even John Lennon could imagine that
Our new paper can buy their newspapers
Millions now, billions later

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
'Cause I'm a bad boy and you liking it
(I'm a bad boy and you liking it)
You say I'm no good, but you liking it
(You say I'm no good, but you liking it)
People telling you to leave me alone
(People telling you to leave me alone)
Ain't nobody else you can't go there with
(Ain't nobody else you can't go there with)

[Post-Chorus: Austin Mahone & Bobby Briscayne]
Come on
Leave me alone (she won't)
Leave me alone (she can't)
Leave me alone (she won't)
Leave me alone
Come on
Hundred on the highway
Homie, you're a Monday
I'm a Friday
Young Sinatra, get it my way
Bad boy and you liking it

[Bridge: Austin Mahone]
I'm everything you don't want
I give you everything that you need
Oh
I'm just bad bad for you

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
'Cause I'm a bad boy and you liking it
(I'm a bad boy and you liking it)
You say I'm no good, but you liking it
(You say I'm no good, but you liking it)
People telling you to leave me alone
(People telling you to leave me alone)
Ain't nobody else you can't go there with
(Ain't nobody else you can't go there with)

[Post-Chorus: Austin Mahone & Bobby Briscayne]
Come on
Leave me alone (she won't)
Leave me alone (she can't)
Leave me alone (she won't)
Leave me alone
Come on
Hundred on the highway
Homie, you're a Monday
I'm a Friday
Young Sinatra, get it my way
Bad boy and you liking it
