[Hook]
We don't need the sun to be shinin'
Who cares if the stars come out tonight?
I know that you're here beside me
And I've never felt so high, so high, so high
I've never felt so high, so high, so high

[Verse 1:]
Show me some love
Give me a call whenever you're alone, you know I'll always be there
And yeah I'm forgetful, I'm used to a handful
But if it was easy, it wouldn't be fair
You look like a angel, loving me is dangerous
And yeah I'm a stranger when it comes to fake shit
So you want love?
So you want love?
But if you want love, you have to take it

[Hook]
We don't need the sun to be shinin'
Who cares if the stars come out tonight?
I know that you're here beside me
And I've never felt so high, so high, so high
I've never felt so high, so high, so high

[Verse 2:]
I don't really know love, I'm willing to learn it
So give me some more love, I'm willing to earn it
This is that good stuff, keep that road turning
Playing with sunshine and never got burned
You look like an angel, loving me is dangerous
And yeah I'm strange when it comes to fake shit
So you want love?
So you want love?
But if you want love, you'll have to take it

[Hook]
We don't need the sun to be shinin'
Who cares if the stars come out tonight?
I know that you're here beside me
And I've never felt so high, so high, so high
I've never felt so high, so high, so high

So high, so high, so high
So high, so high, so high

So you want love?
So you want love?
But if you want love, you'll have to take it

[Hook]
We don't need the sun to be shinin'
Who cares if the stars come out tonight?
I know that you're here beside me
And I've never felt so high, so high, so high
I've never felt so high, so high, so high
