[Intro]
There’s a party going on next door and I’m not invited
There’s a party going on next door and I’m not invited
I’m gonna crash it (for sure)
I’m gonna crash it
Let’s go!

[Hook]
Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I’m VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day
Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I’m VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day

[Verse 1]
Shout out to my neighbor
For fuckin' bein' a hater
Always cookin' some bomb shit
And never gives me a plate or
Says “Hi” when I see her
In the elevator
She got a lot of cute friends
She just say I’m a player
I’m a son of the earth
Been dirty since birth
11:30, I got work, but we should converse
She held on her purse
She was scared for her life
I’m a Malibu boy, hey, [?] all night, let’s get it
Faded, not jaded, intoxicated, I’m Shwayze
They love me but hate the fact radio doesn’t play me
Wouldn't sign a 360, so I just did it 180
Now I’m getting Shwasty with baby, all she got on is pasties

[Hook]
Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I’m VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day
Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I’m VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day

[Verse 2]
These girls are young and they reckless
That’s why I’m using protection
We ain’t paying for shit
But we all in your section
Yeah I’m crashing your party
Like a bad intersection
All these bitches are bad
That’s why I’m fucking your guest list
I’m a player with herb
Conveyor of words
A lover of curves
And I’m a brother to nerds
But I don’t play with dessert
Cause my life’s too sweet
And baby you deserve
A night with me
She said “Baby you trippin’, I need a Jordan, not Pippen”
“You can’t afford a new whip and it’s time for me to stop strippin’”
I said “Girl you a stripper?” she said “Yeah don’t you remember?”
Guess that’s what I get for fuckin' with these girls off of Tinder

[Hook]
Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I’m VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day
Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I’m VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day

[Interlude]
There’s a party going on next door and I’m not invited
There’s a party going on next door and I’m not invited
I’m gonna crash it
I’m gonna crash it
Floating down a hall of an empty building
I smell liquor in the air
(We ain't got no weed but..)
In the air
(..we got some alcohol)
Hear the sound of beer pong drinking
I smell liquor in the air
In the air
In the air
In the air

[Hook]
Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I’m VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day
Drinks on me at my own damn party
Wasted on this Cabernet
I’m VIP at my own damn party
Fuck your guest list every day

[Outro]
Dude, fuck you, and fuck your party, man
I’m at my own party
Me, and Palmula Handerson
It’s gonna be epic
