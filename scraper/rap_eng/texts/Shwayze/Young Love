[Verse 1]
She like to roll it up
Just the way that I like
Then she break it up, just right
And we make love (all night)
She just wanna have fun
She’s dancing up on me
Got the baddest girl up in this spot
But da, da, da (I mean)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she’s a model for Maybelline
Attitude, Cara Delevingne
It’s alcohol, gotta set things, and doin’ things, don’t wanna ruin things
Your body is a language I’m fluent in
Make the reservation and I [?] you in
It ain’t a one-night-stand, if we do it again
(No, no, no)

[Pre-Hook]
She like to go out, get fucked up
And smoke when she drinks
Girlfriends and bomb weed the only thing she needs
She got a attitude in the morning but tequila makes her sweet
Came to Cali for the summer time and that’s how she met me

[Hook]
My young love
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
My young love
And they gon’ hate of course
But ain’t nothing wrong with that
Because me and you, me and you, is the shit

[Past-Hook]
And I know, I know, I know
It’s so hard to take it slow
If what we feel is real
We can blame it on the

[Verse 3]
Young Love
Blowin’ up my phone
Missin’ me on tour
Wanna know when I’m coming home
She gon’ twerk it, like a stripper
Make it clap, send a Snapchat
Ass so fat, you know, I have to screen shot it

[Verse 4]
Oh Lord
Temptation is my ex-chick
But music is my baby, girl
So don’t be mad if I don’t text quick
Yeah I deserve things like one-night-stands
Them knock ‘em off my checklist
I don’t want no drama but I love them young and reckless

[Pre-Hook]
She like to go out, get fucked up
And smoke when she drinks
Girlfriends and bomb weed the only thing she needs
She got a attitude in the morning but tequila makes her sweet
Came to Cali for the summer time and that’s how she met me

[Hook]
My young love
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
My young love
And they gon’ hate of course
But ain’t nothing wrong with that
Because me and you, me and you, is the shit

[Verse 5]
She don’t wanna be just a summer fling
I told her that she’s way more than that
She know that I’m doing things
She always hit me when I touch down like a quarterback

[Pre-Hook]
And I know, I know, I know
It’s so hard to take it slow
If what we feel is real
We can blame it on the

[Hook]
Young love
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
Ain’t nothing wrong with that
My young love
And they gon’ hate of course
But ain’t nothing wrong with that
Because me and you, me and you, is the shit

[Outro]
We very on
Don’t [?]
Got a mixed chick
Tryna get my Halle Berry on
Cool, very strong
On my Shway [?]
Shit it on whack niggas like a seagull, bro
