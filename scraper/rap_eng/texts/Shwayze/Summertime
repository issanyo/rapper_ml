[Intro]
Sometimes I love, sometimes I fight
I really, really love the summertime
Sometimes it shows, sometimes we hide
I really, really love the summertime
Sometimes I love, sometimes I fight
I really, really love the summertime
Sometimes it shows, sometimes we hide
I really, really love the summertime

[Verse 1 : Sky Blu]
99 problems and the summer girls (some are girls)
Gotta love em though them bitches rock my world
They boty fat, what ? Yeah, I keeps em feening
They trynna find a way and like they damon and keenon
You don't understand me, I'm about my family
And 100 grand for show out in Miami bitch
Your ass is sandy and I love it
Summertime loving, making out in public

[Hook : Mark Rosas]
All my days, they blend they feel the same
But only when I'm stuck to you babe
Every summer comes and leaves me changed
And I dont mean to cut you dude babe
I know it does it all for you, but wait
And I just think you're fine, like nothing I could find
In any other seasons so I really love the summertime

[Verse 2 : Shwayze]
Board shorts and some sneakers met a girl by the cuzzi
She rolled up a blunt while I rubbed on her booty
Dinner for two she said, " Yo let's skip the movie"
I found the meaning of summetime, truly
No need to be on me all like that
If it's meant to be, than I'll call you back
Enjoy the scenery, Cali's back
Cause once you go black you never go, Shway
I think you love cause I'm just like your daddy
I think you want me cause you know you can't have me

[Verse 3 : Mark Rosas]
Your arms, my arms were meant to be
Will we find out, we have to leave ! No
It's time so long, we've had our fun
Now summer's gone !
But next year we'll be
Back to where we're from

[Hook : Mark Rosas]
All my days, they blend they feel the same
But only when I'm stuck to you babe
Every summer comes and leaves me changed
And I dont mean to cut you dude babe
I know it does it all for you, but wait
And I just think you're fine, like nothing I could find
In any other seasons so I really love the summertime
