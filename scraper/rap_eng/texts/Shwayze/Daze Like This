[Chorus: Cisco]
Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint
I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point
Must have been a lie that's what my mother said
Every now and then there's going to be daze like this

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
If good guys finish last then I'm bad
I'm trying to take you to the pad
Black James Dean on a moped
No cigarettes nah
I got the big bam booze with the weed instead
And I always got a helmet on my head
Bad girls go fast slow up and crash
Baby on top like a ball of hash
Nino don't stop till he gets the ass
Half full but not half bad
And I really don't want to make you sad girl
But I gotta be on my way

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint
I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point
Must have been a lie that's what my mother said
Every now and then there's going to be daze like this

Oh yeah daze like this
I'm in a daze like this
Daze like this

Momma said there'd be daze like this
Momma said there'd be daze like this

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
It's 8pm two girls pull up in a grey BMW
Like Shwayze we in love with you
They said we got your CD for Christmas
Do you wanna have a threesome with us?
It could be a dream but I don't want it to end
Opened up the back door and I hopped in
Women and weed over bitches and guns
I ain't from the hood

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint
I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point
Must have been a lie that's what my mother said
Every now and then there's going to be daze like this

Daze like this
I'm in a daze like this

Momma said there'd be daze like this
Momma said there'd be daze like this

[Bridge: Shwayze]
Pulled up to the club with no cash
Like I'm doing cannonballs with no splash
But I pulled a ten
And I'll do it again
I dunno it might be the mustache
And you never gonna know if you must ask
But my new CD is a must have
I'm about the quality not the price tag
Better have a nice brain with that nice ass

[Chorus: Cisco]
Woke up in the morning and I rolled myself a joint
I had something to tell you but I forgot so what's the point
Must have been a lie that's what my mother said
Every now and then there's going to be daze like this

Daze like this
I'm in a daze like this

Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
