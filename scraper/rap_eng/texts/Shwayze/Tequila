[Intro]
Ay bro, pass the tequila!

[Verse 1]
(All around the world, all around the world)
It’s three o’clock, we early taking shots
But we don’t care, fuck it [?]
Chillin' with my bros, looking for some ladies
But we never call ‘em hoes, even if they actin' shady
Then we she want my dick, 'cause her name Tracy
Baby booty thick, I ain’t talking ‘bout maybe
One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, four
Took off her clothes before we got home
La di da di, now it’s a party
Baby gettin' naughty, taking shots [?]
A girl taking pictures like the paparazzi
Says she’s been a fan since she see me at The Roxy
She got class, style and [?]
We’re skinny-dippin’, now she think that I’m cocky
Gloves off, like we was boxing
Beat that pussy up in rounds like Rocky

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you make we wanna
Go up to the top and I ain’t coming down, bae
I don’t need another
Drink in my cup but I don’t give a fuck
Whoa-oh, roll up the [?]
Whoa-oh, pass the tequila
(This shit feels good right here)
(What you sippin' on?)

[Chorus]
Na na na na na
Tequila!
Na na na na na
Tequila!
Na na na na na
Tequila!

[Verse 2]
(All around the world, all around the world)
(Another round for my bae, in a song of Shway)
Ay!
I don’t drink Whiskey, or no Mojito
Sippin’ Don Julio or Casamigos
Feeling like a million bugs, when I’m chillin’
Drunk of tequila cause I can give zero
Fucks, what you thinkin'?
Beer-pong-king, pimp
My girl got a girl and they wanna be my girlfriends
One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, four
And took of my clothes before we got home
Shwasted on a sunday, shouldn’t be in church
[?] so good make a nigga run a verse
If you wanna work out, gave baby two shots
Now baby twerking out and can’t find her purse
Getting nutted and squirreled, can’t seem to find [?]
I'm in an Uber and that’s when I heard
"Shwayze, let’s take another shot baby"

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you make we wanna
Go up to the top and I ain’t coming down, bae
I don’t need another
Drink in my cup but I don’t give a fuck
Whoa-oh, roll up the [?]
Whoa-oh, pass the tequila
(Oh, I’m feeling so good right now)
(What you sippin' on?)

[Chorus]
Na na na na na
Tequila!
Na na na na na
Tequila!
Na na na na na
Tequila!

[Outro]
(All around the world, all around the world)
(Another round for my bae, in a song of Shway)
Ay!
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots
Oh yeah!
What you sippin' on?
What you sippin' on?
Me? I be drinking that Tequila first
[?] is on baby
Buy one, buy, can you buy one
