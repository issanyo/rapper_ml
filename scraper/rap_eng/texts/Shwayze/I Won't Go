[Verse 1 : Shwayze]
I ain’t been sleeping, I’m living my dream since I’m the act
Ain’t no such thing as detour me when I get on my path
Remember when it was her and me, she made me relax
Stole my heart like burglary and ain’t give it back
Introduced me to music, fell in love with the track
Had a crush on the beat, this near of high high
In the bedroom I’m thinking the hook lines
I’m laughing at the jokes and I don’t even know the punch lines
Knew it was finished when I missed the anniversary dinner
Maybe you momma was right, you can do better
I’d rather make music than to spend time with you
And the melody is telling me

[Hook : Adele]
I won’t go. I can’t do it on my own
If this ain’t love, then what is ?
I’m willing to take the risk
I won’t go. I can’t do it on my own
If this ain’t love, then what is ?
I’m willing to take the risk

[Verse 2 : Sky Blu]
You do you and I’ll do better than expected
One of the only rappers since Pac with a message
And that message is to give without question
And what you earn in return
Would be better than you projected
Now, that’s my PSA for the day, living man
And it’s not cause I’m getting paid
Some days I meditate under the sun rays
Thanking for a Sunday stuck on the run way
I love it dog but I also love the booth
I call that shit confession cause I always speak the truth
Fore they're crying tears out but it feel like me and you
And the melody is telling me

[Hook : Adele]
I won’t go. I can’t do it on my own
If this ain’t love, then what is ?
I’m willing to take the risk
I won’t go. I can’t do it on my own
If this ain’t love, then what is ?
I’m willing to take the risk
