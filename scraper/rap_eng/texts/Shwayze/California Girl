[Verse 1]
You never show up late
And you make your own money
Such a pretty face
I should go and kiss your mama
I'll be your date
If you'll be mine for the summer

[Chorus]
Be my California girl
I'll be your California man
Baby we got the whole world
In the palm of our hand

[Verse 2]
I only know three chords
But I love to play 'em for you
I don't drive a Porsche
But I be there in a hurry
Sing "Love is free"
And I still can't afford it

[Chorus]
Be my California girl
I'll be your California man
Baby we got the whole world
In the palm of our hand

[Post-Chorus]
In the palm of our hand
We got the whole world
In the palm of our hand

[Bridge]
Spend hours for the hands
Puttin' flowers in your hair
Blowin' smoke rings in the air
I want you everywhere

[Chorus]
Be my California girl
I'll be your California man
Baby we got the whole world
In the palm of our hand

[Outro]
I'll be your California man
Be my California girl
Baby I just can't understand
How you rock my whole world
