This is what you call real puppy love

[Hook: Cyrano]
Baby I’m not usually a shy dude
And I know we ain't in high school
No more
It’s just a little something that I wrote
(A Love letter just a little love letter)
Saying hey girl I know you don’t know me
But maybe we could chill some time
Drink a little wine
You’ll find
Everything you need's right in front of your eyes
Got me singing hey girl I know you don’t know me
And I bet you get this all the time
But I can’t lie
Every time you leave I want to press rewind
Say ay
Ay ay
I love you
(chica chica chica)
Ay
Ay ay
I love you

See what I was really trying to say was well uh

[Verse 1: Aaron Smith]
L-O-V-E is a four letter word
Shit, cause she got me looking for a better herb
Cause she get me highest
Higher than the clouds
On my flight to L.A. and I’m looking for the flyest
If love is a drug I just want to try it
One hit of her lips is like a coke diet
Can’t eat can’t sleep
I can’t silence what I feel so deep
And my heart beats
For her, and she don’t want me
But all I need is time and time is money
And I’m a grown man still just trying to be funny
But I guess this is about money
And cars
So I close my tab at the bar
So I close my tab at the bar
And just then she walked in
I had to to tell her

Every time you leave I want to press rewind
Say ay

[Verse 2: Campa]
She’s a saint I’m a sinner
She want to drink wine I got a vineyard
I’m straight but a little off centered
And it would mean the world if you wanted to enter
I let ya up inside my
She could ride my
(stick)
Lady gaga
(ohh)
Shenana
I’m feeling good but I need her love
Cause when it all adds up
(chica chica)
A plus
And that’s real
I’ll pay for the meal
But you can do desert
I’m looking at your shirt
I’m looking at your skirt
We don’t need to flirt
Baby tell me the directions to pick you up from work
(chica chica)(aaaa)
I’m just a regular guy
Who’s getting paid
Every single day
Dancing in the rain
Bitch I’m on and I want you
I even wrote this song just to flaunt you
I love you
