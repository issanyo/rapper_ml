[Chorus: Cisco]
What it do, baby blue
Who am I? Who are you?
Do you think that we could ever be one instead of two?
What it is about you is
I love everything, your kiss
Your lips, your eyes, your nose
You're perfect
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(You're perfect for me)

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
I know I never get you girl
If I let you go and forget you girl
So I call and I text you girl
To let you know I want next to you girl
We've been playing musical chairs for years
Walking up and down the stairs
Smile as we pass every once in a while
I used to buy a little grass from your brother as a child
Now I'm grown up
Maybe not but I know enough
And if I don't I aight gonna show her love
Be strong, take her broken heart, sew it up
No stairs, this elevator's going up
I be in paradise, million dollar gamble
The odds are against us but I got a handle
Of course I'm talking in the mirror today
Cause when I see you in the street I never say:

[Chorus: Cisco]
What it do, baby blue
Who am I? Who are you?
Do you think that we could ever be one instead of two?
What it is about you is
I love everything, your kiss
Your lips, your eyes, your nose
You're perfect
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(You're perfect for me)

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
I know you never get me girl
If I don't let you know who I am pretty girl
But in my head I see you dancing and twirling
I be your beach boy, you can be my city girl
Love and happiness
Butter napiness
Peanut skin
Salt water taffy lips
Cupid said love ain't an accident
Ran out of arrows so he hit me with the javelin
Travelin'
Wildberry mixed with the ramblin'
Man I want to feel more like a jam band
You my good time girl, what's happen'
TV on the radio, static keep crack-eling
I ain't an acter, You ain't an acter-ess
I want a real love, no cameras
No videos, no cameos
No champagne
Damn
I'm talking to myself again
Cause what I saw on the street I never say

[Chorus: Cisco]
What it do, baby blue
Who am I? Who are you?
Do you think that we could ever be one instead of two?
What it is about you is
I love everything, your kiss
Your lips, your eyes, your nose
You're perfect
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(You're perfect for me)

[Bridge: Shwayze]
It hurts when I bite my tongue with my teeth
Now it's three years later and I still can't speak
I got every sneaker but I still can't sneak
I peaked so I'm looking for a thrill that's cheap
I'm a freak, little like the hunchback
In the corner with a dunce cap
With a hole in my heart with a thumbtack
If you loved me I never would've done that

[Chorus: Cisco]
What it do, baby blue
Who am I? Who are you?
Do you think that we could ever be one instead of two?
What it is about you is
I love everything, your kiss
Your lips, your eyes, your nose
You're perfect

What it do, baby blue
Who am I? Who are you?
Do you think that we could ever be one instead of two?
What it is about you is
I love everything, your kiss
Your lips, your eyes, your nose
You're perfect
(You're perfect for me)(me me me me)
(Perfect for me)(me me me me)
(Perfect for me)(me me me me)
(Perfect for me)(me me me me)
(Perfect for me)(me me me me)
