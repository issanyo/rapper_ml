[Chorus: Cisco]
If you got the weed, I got the pipe
We can get high together all night
If you got the weed I got the light
We can get high together all night

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
9:45 work start at 10
So it look like I'm callin' in sick again
Id rather get some herbs
And kick it with my friends
Hit the beach
And treat it like a weekend
Me and Jen ain't really speakin
So baby girl come over this instant
Got a new ride so fuck the speed limit
I live by the w's: weed n women
I live on the beach down the street from cheech
I can't buy you a drink and its not that im cheap
I'm jus broke ma to let you know
But somehow I always got some weed to smoke
And if I don't I'll still get you high
With my love under the moon sky
21 years young got a limited time
Cuz we livin to die
So I'm livin it right

[Chorus: Cisco]
If you got the weed, I got the pipe
We can get high together all night
If you got the weed I got the light
We can get high together all night

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
It was Saturday
Took her to a play it was the matin√©e
I didn't even pay her
The daddy say that he don't like my ways
Probably because I hit her 3 times a day dropped her off late with a sticky face
So a kiss on the cheek is your mistake
Drivin down PCH with a smile on my face
And a blunt in my ash tray cute chick on my side and the ass is great
Almost outta gas so we hit the bank
Ain't been payed so I told her thanks
When she lent me the card and filled my tank
Yeah she in the scene yada yada
With the Ksubi jeans sidekick and the purse
Alexander McQueen I got ripped t-shirt and some brand new kicks but you know they ain't clean

[Chorus: Cisco]
If you got the weed, I got the pipe
We can get high together all night
If you got the weed I got the light
We can get high together all night

(High together all night)

[Chorus & Outro: Cisco]
If you got the weed, I got the pipe
We can get high together all night
If you got the weed I got the light
We can get high together all night
(High together all night)
If you got the weed, I got the pipe
We can get high together all night
(High together all night)

If you got the weed, I got the pipe
We can get high together all night
If you got the weed I got the light
We can get high together all night

High together all night
High together all night
High together all night
High together all night
