[Chorus: Cisco]
Turn out the light, lock the door
We can make a little love, then make a little more
And tonight, baby I'm yours
We can make a little love, then make a little more

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Little miss, can I steal the kiss
And put it in a bottle with a lemon twist
Pop the cap, and sip it slow
It goes a little something like this
(I wanna see your glow
Dont wanna leave tomorrow)
You blew in like the wind in Chicago
Sippin on silver shots of Milagro
Guess what Los Angeles dove
Thinkin bout your body got the kid all messed up
Fessed up to the crime of this love
I just wouldn't feel right if I left ya
I wish I knew how to say, I really want you to stay

[Chorus: Cisco]
Turn out the light, lock the door
We can make a little love, then make a little more
And tonight, baby I'm yours
We can make a little love, let's make a little love
Yeah, uh

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Click, click take a picture of it
You and I like a mixture of it
Sex and love, put it in a cup
And when I drink, I drink to get drunk
Lights out, who'd I think I was?
Peach fuzz, I'm a sucker like a leech cause
Beg you the keys like Alicia
You my modern day Mona Lisa
I wanna hug ya, I wanna squeeze ya
Keep you up all night like the beasta
And when I leave ya, I wanna need ya
I wanna feel ya in my bones like fever
One hundred and three degrees of heat
Got my heart skippin beats when I see ya
Walkin down the street, walkin down the street

[Chorus: Cisco]
Turn out the light, lock the door
We can make a little love, then make a little more
And tonight, baby I'm yours
We can make a little love, then make a little more

[Post-Chorus: Cisco]
Make a little love
Make a little love
Make a little love
Make a little love
Make a little love
Make a little love
Make a little love

[Bridge: Shwayze]
Lets make love when its pourin outside
Lets make love when its war outside
Lets make love just because
The people of the world dont make enough of it
And when this song is on bump it
Leap for love like you long jumpin
Keep it up cause we all strugglin
All you need is

[Chorus & Outro: Cisco]
Turn out the light, lock the door
We can make a little love, then make a little more
And tonight, baby I'm yours
We can make a little love
Turn out the light, lock the door
We can make a little love, then make a little more
And tonight, baby I'm yours
We can make a little love, then make a little more
