[Chorus]
Good lookin' woman, where did you come from?
There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone

[Verse 1]
You don't know what you got til' it's gone
Let me lay you tonight and twice in the morn'
She love when we fight, I write her a song
But she hate when I drink and gone too long

You always going to think the grass is greener
Til' you lying in the mud, alone and freezing
Shit, I just found love and I let it leave me
I'm so fucked up, I can't believe me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm love drunk and hungover
I don't want to get up yet
(I don't want to get up yet)
We struck like a perfect match
But love burnt me like a cigarette
Oh no

[Chorus]
Good lookin' woman, where did you come from?
There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone

Someone is you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Life on the road is a life alone
I wish we could make love through the phone
They say distance ain't that hard to fight
Though all I got is this mic and this marijuana

I'd rather get love then returned the love
Than never get love I deserved the love
I just found love and I let it leave
I'm so fucked up I can't believe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm love drunk and hungover
I don't want to get up yet
(I don't want to get up yet)
We struck like a perfect match
But love burnt me like a cigarette
Oh no

[Chorus]
Good lookin' woman, where did you come from?
There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone

Someone is you, you, you, you

[Bridge]
And I don't wanna go to sleep (go to sleep)
Without you laying next to me (next to me)
Don't you wake me from this dream
Oh no, girl you too good lookin'

[Chorus]
Good lookin' woman, where did you come from?
There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone

Good lookin' woman, where did you come from?
There ain't no, point in living unless you're loving someone

Someone is you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
