[Intro]
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
I know a place where the hearts don't break
The reality is scripted, and the boobs are fake
The smell of success is sold like inscense
And pump through the vents of your Mercedes-Benz
And all my friends are almost famous
Making sex tapes to get on the A-list
Trynna get their faces on the tabloid pages
So they can get paid to party in Vegas
And rehab, and then it's off to rehab, and a 22 million dollar Malibu beach pad
I seen that the ways these girls on the scene that
When they first show up
Tryna blow up, you know what? These little girls better grow up
Before they sniff and spend all their dough up
O.D. choke on they throw up
At the Hotel California

[Chorus: Cisco]
I know a little place we can go right down the road (Go right down the road)
The lights are always on (On)
The bar is never closed
I know a little place we can go right down the road (Go right down the road)
But nothing good is free (Free)
It'll cost you your heart and your soul

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
I know a place on the Sunset strip
Where all the beautiful ladies like to undress quick
And if you gotta nice whip
And come pick up the check
You can get your dick wet by a young Rockette
Sex money and fame in Los Angeles
It's a place where a pretty face get you access
To the access of the young and the reckless
Another scratch on the bumper of my Lexus
New kid in town is the next big thing
And she sing like a bird if your pitch corrected
Little pop star headed for the top now
In the fast lane, with the top down
Too late for the brakes, can't stop now
Wild child, callin' for your mom now
Screamin' out there's no place like home
And then she spend another night alone

[Chorus: Cisco]
I know a little place we can go right down the road (Go right down the road)
The lights are always on (On)
The bar is never closed
I know a little place we can go right down the road (Go right down the road)
But nothing good is free
It'll cost you your heart and your soul (Soul)

[Verse 3: Shwayze]
It's a shame how the money and fame
Gotta pretty young thang goin' out with a bang
Gettin' used up, so beat and bruised up
The same ol' shit come later, come sooner
Nuthin' new just a different case
She disappeared in a year, no sign no trace
Got caught up in the pace, leather and lace
Got addicted after just one taste
She made an entrance, lit up the place
With a thousand flashes goin' off in her face
She couldn't take it, the fame stripped her naked
Taken over by the need to make it
Sleepin' with the agents to get a start
Sleepin' with directors to get the part
Sleepin' pills and alcohol
I seen it all in the valley of the dogs

[Chorus: Cisco]
I know a little place we can go right down the road (Go right down the road)
The lights are always on (On)
The bar is never closed
I know a little place we can go right down the road (Go right down the road)
But nothing good is free
It'll cost you your heart and your soul
(Soul, soul)

I know a little place we can go right down the road (Go right down the road)
The lights are always on (On)
The bar is never closed
I know a little place we can go right down the road (Go right down the road)
But nothing good is free
It'll cost you your heart and your soul (Soul, soul)
(Cost you your heart and your soul)
