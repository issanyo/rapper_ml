[Hook : Paul Couture]
When the skies falling down
We'll be up on the clouds
It's hard to find a simple way
To say I love you
From the streets, to the beach
The beat makes you feel complete
I found a universe away
To say I love you

[Verse 1: Sky Blu]
You're the song that my heart beat to
Girl you're my oxygen I breathe you
I need you every second of my life
Every day, every night
Got a brother feelin right
Welcome to Paris mi amor
Lemme be a gentleman and open your door
I bet you never had it like this before
You light champagne lemme pop the core
I love you, you love me
I'm about to drop to one knee
Honey moon where the phone don't reach
Paradise, with a smoke like cheech
Crazy, that this lady, could be my baby
Do what we do till where 80
And beyond cause were crazy

[Hook : Paul Couture]
When the skies falling down
We'll be up on the clouds
It's hard to find a simple way
To say I love you
From the streets, to the beach
The beat makes you feel complete
I found a universe away
To say I love you

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Like James Dean hit the scene
With a model hooked on nicotine
Drink the bottle quicker then you ever seen
She met me when she was 21
And wanna do anything under the sun
Like menage trois filete miñón
Live fast, die young its what she told me
Made love she even wanna hold me
Truthfully it was more than sex
Thinking in my mind like baby whats next ?
2 days past, no text
Tryna play cool, act like I didn't notice
Uh, with a hole in my heart
Baby girl its cold in the dark
And I want you layin in my arms
When the sun dont shine I keep you warm

[Hook : Paul Couture]
When the skies falling down
We'll be up on the clouds
It's hard to find a simple way
To say I love you
From the streets, to the beach
The beat makes you feel complete
I found a universe away
To say I love you

[Verse 3 : Paul Couture]
My name's Paul C and I came to say
I made this beat in a special way
For my special girl you're the best ok
So lets get away to central play
Hey, lets go baby ! No dress code baby
Yeah, let the stress go baby
You dont wanna make me let the rest go baby

[Hook : Paul Couture]
When the skies falling down
We'll be up on the clouds
It's hard to find a simple way
To say I love you
From the streets, to the beach
The beat makes you feel complete
I found a universe away
To say I love you
