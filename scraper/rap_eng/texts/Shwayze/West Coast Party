[Verse 1]
First name Bianca, last name no-way
Bitch stole my heart like I used to in the old days
Booty so soft like the oil of the Olay
But I can't get the bag, well okay
She one night stand me, now she can't stand me
Every time she see me red carpet at the Grammys
Its cool, I'mma get my chance
Just like homie from save the last dance
So save the last hit and save the last shot
Party with the pretty girls in flip flops
Chilling on the beach with the new one too
Get it, now thats a new one-two
They say every star gotta shine
Well I guess I got mine
Im on my own, well Im in my zone
And I ain't staying home tonight

[Chorus]
Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party dont stop
You know we gone party like a west coast party
Til somebody calls the cops
Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
First name gorgeous, last name dont-care
Dont worry bout the haters baby they ain't going nowhere
Tell me where you wanna go, Ill just put the show there
They calling you a ho but it really ain't no fair
Wardrobe crazy, hanging with Shwayze
You know I like white girls, I gotta mixed baby
Shout out to my sisters I could be your mister
Dont be mad when my jeans dont fit ya
Skinny dude, big dick, all about my stick shift
No I ain't a skater but Ill shove it in your chick quick
California veteran, New York resident
Smoking on the medicine, the next black president
Yo I crash boat parties and snag a few hotties
Party on the weekdays, sleep on the weekends
And when the sun sets were gone do it all again

[Chorus]
Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party dont stop
You know we gone party like a west coast party
Til somebody calls the cops
Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party dont stop
You know we gone party like a west coast party
Til somebody calls the cops
Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party dont stop
You know we gone party like a west coast party
Til somebody calls the cops
Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
