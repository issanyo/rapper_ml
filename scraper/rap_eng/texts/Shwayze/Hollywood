[Chorus: Cisco]
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Ay yo
What the hell am I rhyming for
Designer clothes and designer whores
Designer cars and designer doors
Designer kitchen with designer drawers
Hell no, vagina dog
The other shit bore me like a monologue
Like The Beatles when they were bigger then Jesus
I'm genius Bill Clinton were my speeches
Look you in the eye and lie
Believe it, I mean it
Girl I'm leaving
I don't really know where I'm gonna go
But I got a backpack full of demos
I'm a player baby, I should run for mayor maybe
The way I'm politicking lately
The way I'm politicking ladies
The way I'm politicking ladies

[Chorus: Cisco]
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
I'm convinced that if I hop the fence
I can climb on in and get my fingerprints on your booty, julie
I know you wanna do me
Since I moved to malibu from the hood like a movie
Peoples chant with my sneakers in the sand
Blowing up like an amp so they kicked me out the band
That's when I met my man strummin on a six string drink in his hand talking to his ding-a-ling

[Pre-Chorus: Shwayze]
Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody always picking on me
Whys everybody still coming to my party

(Everybody coming to my partybackground)

[Chorus: Cisco]
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
And it ain't no place for us

[Bridge: Shwayze]
Everybody coming to my party
It starts today
We getting naughty by 9
So don't be late
There's gonna be a line
So prepare to wait
Fine fine ladies first
And bring your ice skates
And bring your wings
We all getting high tonight
And touching things
Muffin butt blowing cigarette rings

Everybody coming to my party
Everybody coming to my party
Everybody coming to my party
Everybody coming to my party

[Chorus & Outro: Cisco]
Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore

Some say when it rains it pours
Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
