[Chorus: Cisco]
Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Yo. Lil girls in the city. Dress up pretty
Go out and get messed up and shitty
Girls by the sea, dress like hippies. And wear love beads and go skinny dippin'
Girls in the hills, go day trippin. To get their nails done, and hair straighten
Lil girls in the 818. Get hot when I roll over laurel canyon

[Pre-Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her, but I get her when I do
Let me tell you about a girl I love
She stay at home cause she hate the club
Baby but, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

[Chorus: Cisco]
Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Girls in New York look like giraffes
Long neck, long legs, tiny tits and ass
Girls from L.A. rock over-sized shades
And chill all day cause they already paid
Girls in Miami, string bikinis
Bump techno by Dj Tiesto
Girls from Detroit Like electro. And dance all night till they break they neck, yo

[Pre-Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
Let me tell you about a girl I love
Let me tell you about a girl I love

[Chorus: Cisco]
Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

[Bridge: Shwayze & Cisco]
Now if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up
If you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up
If you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love
If you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love
Now if you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up
If you lookin for love, won't you put you hands up
Now, if you lookin for love then I'm lookin for love, huh
And this is what I'm lookin for

[Pre-Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She like hip hop and rock and roll
She walk slow down the avenue
I ain't met her, but I get her when I do
Let me tell you about a girl I love
She stay at home cause she hate the club
Baby but, pretty little features
I ain't met her but I'll get her when I see her

[Chorus: Cisco]
Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street

Baby will you be my corona and lime
And I will be your main squeeze
And if your brother don't like my style
We could take it to the street
We could take it to the street
