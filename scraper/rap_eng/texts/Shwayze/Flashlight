[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Ay yo it's 6 AM and I'm drinkin' a brew
6:45 still thinkin' of you
Thinkin who, wanna give they love to you
Better than the only black kid in the 'bu ?
I ain't from the hood but my rap is good
Knocked three times on the cadillac wood
Kid got luck like a rabbits foot
Shit is good yeah shit is good
Chillin in the sand with my video cam
Swallowed the benzodiazipan
Sports illustrated model gettin' tan
Said "damn Shwayze you kinda like the man"
Yeah I am and I'm big in Japan
My pick in my hair and my dick in my hand
What would you do with a hundred grand?
Shit, id buy a fresh ass benz

[Chorus: Cisco]
When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Left the club when it's light outside
She sing along to my songs in the ride
"It's alright we can call it a night"
I said politely even though it didn't sound right
She said "yeah right"
I said "damn straight"
I know a place where we can get down babe
I got a blanky
I'll lay it on the sand sand
I went deep like the God damn Grand Can
Grand slam, bacon and the ham
She was a fan that turned to a friend
But now I think I love her since I took her to bed
She shook up my head
Took all my time
Spent all my money on diamonds and wine
What would you do with a hundred grand?
Shit I'd spend it all on a girl man
What would you do with a hundred grand?
Shit I'd buy a fresh ass Benz

[Chorus: Cisco]
When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

[Verse 3: Shwayze]
You got a light? Boy I got a spliff
Gotta split got a life to live
I gotta get gotta write some shit
On the tip of my tongue just like a kiss
I might miss but I might just hit
And if I do I'm a be hella rich
And I'll get a way finer bitch
So you better be nice sweet lips
And I might just buy you a Benz

[Chorus & Outro: Cisco]
When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights

When she walked in that club that night
She had a look in her eye like a flashlight
She said baby I'm a be alright
And the DJ put on our favorite song
And we danced beneath the lights
