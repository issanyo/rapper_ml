[Verse 1: Shwayze]
With my Raincoat on
It's alright baby hold my hand
I ain't tryin to be your man
Lets take it slow relax a little
Make it so it's natural
As a matter of fact lets take it black
To the very first time I had your back
We shared a cab
Shared a glass
Shared a laugh and I kissed your ass
Kissed your lips, after class
We both had history after math
Passing notes teacher askin for em I read em out loud to the class like a poem or a rap
Say it like I mean it with by big toe tap
Head gonna bop back and forth like that
And if you like what you here you can meet me out back... out back

[Pre-Chorus: Shwayze]
With my raincoat on
In the heart of the sun
With my raincoat on
In the heart of the city, heart of the city

[Chorus: Cisco]
I la la lost my mind
I la la lost my lady
I la la lost my mind
But I lu lu love you baby

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
It cross my mind that I lost my mind, I guess I should check back in sometime
Sometime, the perfect little world rhymes and sometimes it don't fine
Rewind repeat it three times if you mean it, I want a crib by the beach believe it so baby doll I'm leavin, baby doll I'm leavin

Duffle bag filled with clothes, notebook filled with flows
Phonebook filled with hoes, my dope hook gonna get me close
My hope is what drives me towards this future like a midnight double feature so high that I blow those tweetas in ya speakers

[Pre-Chorus: Shwayze & Cisco]
With my raincoat on
With my raincoat on
In the heart of the sun
In the heart of the sun
With my raincoat on
With my raincoat on
In the heart of the city
In the heart of the city

[Chorus: Cisco]
I la la lost my mind
I la la lost my lady
I la la lost my mind
But I lu lu love you baby

[Verse 3: Shwayze]
Woke up at about noon just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
To get my head lined up and a new tattoo, the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The mac of the year Shwayze's a fool, take you to school and pick you up too
Maybe I'd do anything for you
Maybe I'd do anything for you
Maybe I'd do anything for you
Would you do it for me?

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
I la la lost my mind
She's out the door
I la la lost my lady
She's out the door
I la la lost my mind
She's out the door
But I lu lu love you baby
She's out the door

I la la lost my mind
I la la lost my lady
I la la lost my mind
But I lu lu love you baby

I la la lost my mind
I la la lost my lady
I la la lost my mind
But I lu lu love you baby
