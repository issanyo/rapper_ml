[Intro]
Yeah that summer ink
Keeps you beside me
That I haven’t seen
You since July
And I’m wondering
Why did I take that drink?

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Baby you got me thinking
Maybe I should stop drinking
Every other sentence in my life is like a weekend
Maybe my liver hate me
I think my lady do too
Got me [?] in your spell, love voodoo
[?] all I need is you
And that little [?]
She say that I’m a dog
Always looking for a bitch
And throw a doggy bone
And baby at the end
It is that you’re going home with Shwayze
Yeah, 6 am and we still chillin’
On the guitar, like the black Bob Dylan
She said “Whatcha wanna do for livin’?”
I just wanna be livin’

[Pre-Hook]
That summer ink
Keeps you beside me
That I haven’t seen
You since July
And I’m wondering
Why did I take that drink?
And when I wake
I see your name in summer

[Hook]
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink
I see your name in summer
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink
I see your name in summer
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink
I see your name in summer
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink

[Verse 2]
She want me to hit it, hit it with another line
Tell her that I’m the king of the summertime
I got more rhythm than the drum line
And I’m fucking high, not just sometimes
Am I sinkin’, am I swimmin’?
How is it I’m surrounded by all of these fine women
But I got [?] a vision
I only see you
Hoes gon’ hate cause they can’t be you
Be true, too soon, for me, that’s aggressive
I did that once and I really learned my lesson
I guess summer ink, it is gone in the blink of an eye
This year, I want you, to be my

[Pre-Hook]
Summer ink
Keeps you beside me
That I haven’t seen
You since July
And I’m wondering
Why did I take that drink?
And ask your need
Bring you back to my place
And when I wake
I see your name in summer

[Hook]
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink
I see your name in summer
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink
I see your name in summer
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink
I see your name in summer
Ink, ink, ink, ink, ink
