[Hook]
Do the Scrooge McDuck and then you dive into your money
Do the Scrooge McDuck and then you dive into your money
Do the Scrooge McDuck and then you dive into your money
Call me Uncle Scrooge cause I'm all about my money, bitch
Cause I'm all about my money !
Cause I'm all about my money !

Call me Uncle Scrooge cause I'm all about my money, bitch

[Verse 1: Sky Blu]
I walk around town, so legit
Cause I'm makin' hits and I own shit
Make a lot of money then I blow shit
Smoke a lot of weed cause I grow shit
Yeah, I'll show you what a mogul is
Just bought a jet, now I'm global bitch
Dropped off a million, at an orphanage
Yo, this is how you look in a Porsche kids
You've never seen a-nother nigga cleaner
Jacuzzi in my jet, and Fifa in my Beamer
Ah ah ! Im stylin baby, money pilin baby
When my shits a hit I'm gonna buy another Harlem, baby

[Hook]
Do the Scrooge McDuck and then you dive into your money
Do the Scrooge McDuck and then you dive into your money
Do the Scrooge McDuck and then you dive into your money
Call me Uncle Scrooge cause I'm all about my money, bitch
Cause I'm all about my money !
Cause I'm all about my money !
Cause I'm all about my money !
Call me Uncle Scrooge cause I'm all about my money

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
I ain't all about the money but I'm all about the cash flow
All about the booty cause baby, I'm an asshole
You all about comin up and comin fast
Good guys finish first ? I finish last
Tidal wave of money while you other suckers duck dive
Call me Laird Hamilton and you are just low tide
Leg steeze, wakeboard
You say you're makin' money, but we make a way more

[Outro]
Call me Uncle Scrooge cause I'm all about my money, bitch
Do the Scrooge Mcduck, and then you dive into your money
We evolve everyday, thats why we're fuckin rich
Call me Uncle Scrooge, cause I'm all about my money, bitch
