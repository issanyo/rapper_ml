[Hook]
Does it make me an addict?
'Cause I gotta have it
Does it make you an actress?
'Cause you’re so dramatic
My prescription, gotta have it
Must be trippin’ of your madness
So what?
I’m addicted to all your love

[Verse 1]
Come on pretty baby, tell me what you wanna say
Love it or hate it, you never find another Shway
Make up to break up, baby you're the day
Wake up to bake up, that’s the Cali way
No fake stuff for make-up on that pretty face
Baby girl tell me you gon’ stay (Yeah, okay)
Come let me hit it (No way)

[Pre-Hook]
Baby (Yeah)
You know you’re like my favorite drug
And lately (Yeah)
I just can’t seem to get enough
Let’s party (All right)
Let’s OD (All night)
With you by my side we ain’t never coming down

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She’s addicted, to my dick, dick
But I don’t fall in love, like my shoes are untied
But then I kicked it, and it was different
Like I was smoking an L, and it’s a brand new high
When I hit it, I don’t wanna pass it around
Love coma, and it’s all coming back to me now
Coming back to me now
Love coma cause her booty keep on knockin' me out

[Pre-Hook]
Baby (Yeah)
You know you’re like my favorite drug
And lately (Yeah)

Let’s party (All right)
Let’s OD (All night)
With you by my side we ain’t never coming down

You are my strength and weakness
My drug and it ain’t a secret
