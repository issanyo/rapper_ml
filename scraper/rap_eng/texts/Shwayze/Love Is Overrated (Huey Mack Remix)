I just wanna fuck tonight
Cuz love is overrated
I don’t wanna take my time
Because that gets complicated
And you get so get so jaded
Please don’t please don’t think we dating
I just wanna fuck tonight
Cuz love is overrated

I’ll admit I fell in love with a friend
And it’s something I’m never doing again
Cause love only complicates shit
And I would rather keep it basic
I had my heart broke
Looking back I couldn’t face it
Now I got a ice box where my heart is
And it’s stone cold fox where my cock lives
City to city every night got another flight
New town new bra got another wife, right?
Sike that shit is not for me
I’ve never really been the type for monogamy
More the type for a night when I’m in your town
Get a new boy because you’re tying me down

I ain’t looking for love(x3) tonight
I ain't looking for love(x2) I just wanna have a good time

Please don’t please don’t think we dating
I just wanna fuck tonight
Cuz love is overrated
La la la la la Love is overrated (x4)

Went from hoping and praying to find love, to not giving a fuck every morning when I wake up
Like last night I was in Tampa with Samantha and Samanta had really big hammers
That’s the life we living now
I don’t have the time to settle down
But we can have the night and girl if I gotta run you can find a better man because I’m ain’t really the right one

Baby tell me how you feel
We can have a little fun in the morning I'mma peel to a
New city find a new set of titties
I know you wanna row but you can’t come with me
I ain’t looking for love(x3) tonight
I ain't looking for love(x2) I just wanna have a good time
