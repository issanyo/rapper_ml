Roll the camera, roll the camera, roll the camera, roll it

[Hook]
Tonight is gonna be a movie (it’s gonna be movie)
'Cause I’m looking for some action
Baby, a booty and some boobies
But that brings a main injection
Girl you know you ain’t gotta act [?]
Hey and that’s bitches doing extra
Tonight is gonna be a movie (it’s gonna be a movie)
We all looking for some action
Tonight is gonna be a movie

[Verse 1]
Ay, ay
When your chick starts a scene
I got melodramatic
When that booty’s the bomb
I wanna [?]
I wanna get panoramic
Naked and then ham it, goddammit
Tonight is a movie and my then phone is the camera
I be black Tommy Lee
And you can be Pamela
Wanna explore your canals
And I ain’t talking ‘bout Panama
I ain’t talking ‘bout Venice
We disturbin’ the [?]
As I record every minute
In High Definiton
'Cause your body’s exquisite
But love’s unexhibit
Bitch girl love to pimp my ride just like Xzibit
Then she disappeared when they sting, just like Xzibit
From my sheets to the silverscreen
I knew you was gifted

[Verse 2]
Movie for peace sake
So I need to keep safe
A piece of history, I get fast forward and replay
Had me floored and speechless
Like where did they teach this?
Thicky had me trippin’ when she showed me a secret
You’re a muse not a groupie
You’re the fuse to my fire
And if I’m lie in your cookie
I’m a vampire, you sook me
We get higher than [?]
And turn a [?]
I never had a limp biscuit
But I’m all about [?]

[Hook]
Tonight is gonna be a movie (it’s gonna be movie)

Tonight is gonna be a movie (it’s gonna be a movie)
We all looking for some action
Oh you gonna let me

[Bridge]
Take you on 50 first dates (oh you gonna let me)
Bring me back to my birthplace (oh you gonna gonna)
Make you clap, patty-cake, patty-cake (oh you gonna gonna)
Leave me like Tom, and cast away (oh you gonna let me)
Take you on 50 first dates (oh you gonna let me)
Bring me back to my birthplace (oh you gonna gonna)
Make you clap, patty-cake, patty-cake (oh you gonna gonna)
Leave me like Tom, and cast away
