[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
The man on the radio said
James Brown is dead
Godfather of soul, lays in his bed, yeh
Have you heard what the kids are listening to?

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Yo, uh
Woke up, (got high)
Sho'nuff (sky high)
Got in the ride turned the radio up
Then they said James Brown was dead
Is it true? Or am I just doped up
Know what? I'm calling my folks up
They said he died cause hip hop sucks
Ain't got no soul like a old pair of Chucks
It's about time that somebody stepped up

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
The man on the radio said
I regret to report
James Brown is dead
Just press record
Godfather of soul, lays in his bed, yeh
Have you heard what the kids are listening to?

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Hit the studio (check 1, 2)
Sho'nuff, yo Cisco turn my headphones up
I got a message for the kids of America
Play it loud in your hi-fi stereo
Wi-fi, download the ringtone
California love is your theme song
Drop the guitar, le'mme hear the beat y'all
Do like Dr. Brown and move your feet y'all

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
The man on the radio said
I regret to report
James Brown is dead
Just press record
Godfather of soul, lays in his bed, yeh
Have you heard what the kids are listening to?

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
I just got back from a little vacation
Grew some wings and flew to Vegas
Met a girl, took her 'round the world
Form New York, New York to Caesar's
Now I'm sitting in L.A. alone
I fell asleep with my blue jeans on
I woke up had three missed calls
They said - James Brown is gone

(James Brown is dead)
(I regret to report)
(Have you heard what the kids are listening to?)
(I regret to report James Brown is dead)
(I regret to report James Brown is dead)
(Have you heard what the kids are listening to?)

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
And the man on the radio said
I regret to report
James Brown is dead
Just press record
Godfather of soul, lays in his bed, yeh
Have you heard what the kids are listening to?

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
And the man on the radio said
I regret to report
James Brown is dead
Just press record
Godfather of soul, lays in his bed, yeh
Have you heard what the kids are listening to?
