(Hook: Hoodie Allen)
And we all just wanna shine
Before we pass our prime
So right now is just my time
So get your hands high
And we could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We can say bye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

(Verse 1: Hoodie Allen)
Okay
Woke up in a bed
I ain't worried 'bout who next to me
Question marks and exclamation points will be the death of me
Never have I ever gave a fuck about the recipe
Cause everything I make these mutha fuckas say is specialty
So I just, I just, cook it up and let you bask in it
Cause all I'm after is some furiously fast women
Pump the brakes and hit the gas women
I ain't thinking 'bout no class dog
I'm on my Billy Madison
I said I'm all about the green like my cars, Miss Lippy
Always with a southern chick, I never Mississippi
Always acting drunk as shit, but never getting tipsy
That's a stupid combination, like a hippy playing Frisbee
So, throw it back when you see me
The writings on the wall, and I ain't talking graffiti
Tell her that I'm a god, and I ain't talking to Shiva, Kamini
I'm on another level no Avicii
Holla at me when you see me, whoop!

(Hook: Hoodie Allen)
And we all just wanna shine
Before we pass our prime
So right now is just my time
So get your hands high
And we could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We can say bye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

(Verse 2: Hoodie Allen)
Thinking 'bout my old life
Move on to the future
Trade my dirty Converse for a brand new pair of Supras
Cause I'm super
In high school they done told me I'm a loser
Now they come to all my shows
And brag about how they new ya, hallelujah!
And they wanna bow to to the kid
But I'm about to make a hundred thou' for the gig
Mutha fuckas told me I'm not allowed to be rich
Well, you one percenters, just got a different agenda
I never be the person I'm trying hard to remember
Shout out to Stacy Ferg cause she started out as a pretender
Fell in love with a girl that I met way back in September
So I spent the whole winter trying to sweat her
And they say and that you got it, you got it bad
Don't need no usher
Point me in the direction of how I'm able to fuck her
Trying to say goodbye, but I forgot your number
She said focus on yourself before you focus on others, shit

(Hook: Hoodie Allen)
And we all just wanna shine
Before we pass our prime
So right now is just my time
So get your hands high
And we could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We can say bye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

(Verse: Shwayze)
I said bye to the old me
Getting high off the OG
Riding 'round with my homies
And you can't tell me nothing
No you can't tell me nothing
Ask yo girl if she know me (she does)
Got me high when we blow trees
Never hide from the police
Cause they can't tell me nothing
Nah they can't tell me nothing
Naw mean?

(Hook: Hoodie Allen)
And we all just wanna shine
Before we pass our prime
So right now is just my time
So get your hands high
And we could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We could wave goodbye
To my old life
We can say bye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
