[Verse 1: Shwayze]
She look like sex, drugs, rock and roll
When she move it on the dance floor
Stop, go, stop and go
Like a New York cab yo
Fast, slow, fast and slow
She drives me mad yo
Just like my nano
She shuffling, I’m lovin’ it

[Pre-Chorus: Shwayze]
I’m thinking about touchin’ it
Kissin’ her in public
But baby got me fumblin’
Stumblin’, and mumblin’
She got me wonderin’
If I should get her number then
She just looked up at me and said

[Chorus: Cisco]
Take me in the bathroom
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against a dirty wall
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home (wait to get you home)

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
She tastes like cigarettes and alcohol
Up all night on Aderoll
Innocent, but not at all
She my Brooklyn Barbie doll
Dancin’ like (mmm), fakin’ like (ohhh)
What you think about sex on the first night? (okay)

[Pre-Chorus: Shwayze]
I’m thinking about touchin’ it
Kissin’ her in public
But baby got me fumblin’
Stumblin’, and mumblin’
She got me wonderin’
If I should get her number then
I just looked at her instead and said

[Chorus: Cisco]
Take me in the bathroom
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against a dirty wall
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home (wait to get you home)

Take me out the back door
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against somebody’s car
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home (wait to get you home)

[Bridge: Shwayze]
She was a waitress
Wait, she was an actress
I, dimmed like a starlet, in fact she was a harlot
Her lips like Scarlet, Johansson
They part to say I’m handsome
I start to say I know
That’s when she pulled out my handgun (bam)

[Chorus: Cisco]
Take me in the bathroom
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against a dirty wall
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home (wait to get you home)

Take me out the back door
Take my clothes off
Make love to me up against somebody’s car

‘Cause I can’t wait to get you
‘Cause I can’t wait to get you home
