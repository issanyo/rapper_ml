[Verse 1 : Paul Couture]
I'm in this hotel with this two bro's
From Arizona that you talk
Cause I'm on the road, on the road
She give me that dumb and bring on the road
Cause she top class, top model, BBU stay pop bottles
Me and Shway' so confused, plays all day in Malibu
What a bad bitch in that fast car, just me and my baby strollin
Cause we're rollin like fast car, no breaks, so don't hate
Cause I'm on it that ricket body, in that new Bugatti
Baby please believe me, call me sweet baby Jesus
We, we party for a living and Lord I know we're standin
But all my people with me who was down from the beginnin
So shout out to that ATX, shout out to that H town
I know that you've been waiting and I appreciate the patience
Now let's work !

[Hook : Paul Couture]
From to sun down there's one thing on my mind
People come and people go but I stay on my grind
We ride, we roll, we know, we know
We let it till the sun comes up
A it's time to go to work work work work work work work
It's time to go to work work work work work work work
It's time to go to work
Now drop it to the floor real slow it's gonna work
Let's take it to the crib that's what I call home work
Ain't got a real job so I gotta make it work
Baby roll with me and you ain't never gotta work

[Verse 2 : Shwayze]
I got ten bucks in my pocket, but my bitch is still the hottest
You rap about my life style, but don't know a thing about it
See to me life's a bitch, I stay smoking palm trees
And the winner's 80 degrees with I in it the : go freeze
My model is all the fliest, my weed get you the highest
If you ain't got love you buy it, if I ain't got love I'm dying
Me and you and now alike, homie I can get more likes, homie
All my girlfriends all white, but then my chains bout tonight, homie
Shwayze, beast boy, your girl think I'm unique boy
Nigga ain't you gotta speak boy, but end up in them sheets boy
Just some of my nick names and no I ain't gotta speak game
She a bow when I spin chance, if not I'm on my little wayne
Work
