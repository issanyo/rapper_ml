[Hook]
If you looking for a good time, oh yeah
And you been waiting for the sunshine, oh yeah
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)
I’m the King of the Summer

[Verse 1]
I don’t even know your name
And you don’t even know that I’m famous
We just happen to be in the right place at the right time, oh yeah
Hanging out with Mary Jane
When the love hits it’s painless
Malibu Beach with my Barbie
It’s B.Y.O.B. at the party

[Pre-Hook]
We gon’ be drinkin' and smokin'
Straight up, west-coastin'
Cheersin' and toastin'
We live in the moment
Shwasted, naked
All night like it’s Vegas (Vegas, Vegas)
All night like it’s Vegas

[Hook]
If you looking for a good time, oh yeah
And you been waiting for the sunshine, oh yeah
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)
And if you gonna do it, baby do it all night
'Cause this is something you been waiting on your whole life
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and I’m at the house party, get-get-gettin' lit
I swear my life’s a movie and I wrote the script
'Member back in high school, straight slangin' zips
Same old high fools, still chasin' chicks
Hanging out with Mary Jane
When the love hits it’s painless
Malibu beach with my Barbie
It’s B.Y.O.B. at the party

[Pre-Hook]
We gon’ be drinkin' and smokin'
Straight up, west-coastin'
Cheersin' and toastin'
We live in the moment
Shwasted, naked
All night like it’s Vegas (Vegas, Vegas)
All night like it’s Vegas

[Hook]
If you looking for a good time, oh yeah
And you been waiting for the sunshine, oh yeah
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)
And if you gonna do it, baby do it all night
'Cause this is something you been waiting on your whole life
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)
I’m the King of the Summer (King of the Summer)

[Outro]
All night
All night
King of the Summer
King of the Summer
