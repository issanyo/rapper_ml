[Hook : Shwayze]
And, I don't wanna lie no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna get high no more
But it's all I know, all I know, all I know

[Verse 1 : Shwayze]
Now everybody want the Shwayze flow
Let me meet your lady, be prepared to let your baby go
Beach boy, surf's up with a Jane Doe
That mean she fresh to death even in plain clothes
She a rich girl, we in a Range Rov'
She ain't my girlfriend, she my main, know
I put the CD on my back like a Jenks point
That's when I told her I'd be back and I hit the A pole
This new city is pretty, tonight we gonna party
I bet the bar, totally, is already flooded with hotties
Left my bag in the lobby, got a tequila and probably
Gonna be drunk at the show, my cutie cute, she saw me

[Hook : Shwayze]
And I don't wanna lie no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna get high no more
But it's all I know, all I know
And I can blame it on the alcohol
And take another adderall
And you're not even mad at all
Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know

[Verse 2 : Tayyib Ali]
All these new place got me seeing hella faces
We smoking doobies with Shwayze looking at my life in HD
It's crazy how things can change
And you probably thought I'd be different but I stayed the same
Riding in my lane, looking sippy, ass licking
And I just won the bad chick with ash tits and brains mashed
Then run into me after a long day, it's how we play, it's how my grind work
In my line when you come to Philly cause I got work
I just hit the town and roam, don't know where Imma go
The music makes me feel all lonely on this rocky road
Smoke another O, I think I'm better off alone
But we just party and get drunk until the morning sun

[Hook : Shwayze]
And I don't wanna lie no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna get high no more
But it's all I know, all I know
And I can blame it on the alcohol
And take another adderall
And you're not even mad at all
Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know

[Interlude : Shwayze]
I know that I love you
I know that I care
Yeah, I know that I want to
But I can't always be there
And now every day I'm thinking about
What would've been, what could've been
What I should've did but I didn't do
I say I'm over you but I'm missing you
An apology is overdue but this is what I do

[Hook : Shwayze]
And I don't wanna lie no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna get high no more
But it's all I know, all I know
And I can blame it on the alcohol
And take another adderall
And you're not even mad at all
Cause it's all I know, all I know, all I know

[Outro : Shwayze]
I know that I love you, I know that I care
I know that I love you, I know that I care
I know that I love you, I know that I care
I know that I want to but I can't always be there
