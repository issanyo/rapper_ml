Pretty girl make you wanna do anything
You make me wanna do everything
Hey
Tell me what you want girl
Tell me what you need

Tell me where you wanna go, pretty girl
I'll be your guy tonight
We got a whole lot to explore
Don't be shy
We got all night

You make me wanna be a millionaire
The way you walk on the spot and steal the stares
Climb to the top, you could be the stairs
Wit you on my arm, I'm already there
Cheers, here to us
Eye contact, ?
I'm tryna steal a kiss before the night is up

Tell me where you wanna go, pretty girl
I'll be your guy tonight
We got a whole lot to explore
Don't be shy
We got all night

I'll be whatever you need me to be
I'll be your captain in the deep blue sea
I'll be your breeze when the summer hits
When it gets too hot, i'll be your trees
When you need a hit, I'll be your fix?
But you ain't broke see, we can't miss
You so dope, lets take a trip
Point to the map and get yo shit

Tell me where you wanna go, pretty girl
I'll be your guy tonight
We got a whole lot to explore
Don't be shy
We got all night

You and I are so right
Were different than the others
I just want to get you high
Here from under the covers
I got an idea babe, our souls intertwined
Lets do it

Tell me where you wanna go, pretty girl
I'll be your guy tonight
We got a whole lot to explore
Don't be shy
We got all night
X2

Yeah, we still got the whole night ahead of us
Oh, you inspiring girl
You make me wanna do better
Ah, ah, ah
