[Chorus: Cisco]
Sally is a hippie girl one day
Sally is a rock chick the next
Sally is a hip-hop baby
Then a trip, hot lady
But there's one thing Sally says everyday, and it's
She loves me
She loves me just the way I am
Yeah she loves me
She loves me just the way I am

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
I got a girl named Sally
She like to keep it chilly
One day it's hippie chic
Next day it's Gucci Fendi
She got a gold chain
Like it was 1980
She buys three magazines a week
Just to see who I'm dating
I been to Paris, London and still
I come back to Sally
Cause I know how she feels

[Chorus: Cisco]
Sally is a hippie girl one day
Sally is a rock chick the next
Sally is a hip-hop baby
Then a trip, hot lady
But there's one thing Sally says everyday, and it's
She loves me
She loves me just the way I am
Yeah she loves me
She loves me just the way I am

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
I got a girly-girl
But she's a tomboy
She like to go nuts
My little almond joy
I try to make her blush
But she's just way too tough
Yeah she's so emo with her
Make-up and her haircut
She's a rich a girl
But she could care less
American Apparel with her
Dad's American Express
She's a college girl
Lettin loose at night
In a mini skirt, sippin goose and sprite
She's all around the world
She ain't your average girl
And every time I leave
I'm coming back to her

[Chorus: Cisco]
Sally is a hippie girl one day
Sally is a rock chick the next
Sally is a hip-hop baby
Then a trip, hot lady
But there's one thing Sally says everyday, and it's
She loves me
She loves me just the way I am
Yeah she loves me
She loves me just the way I am

[Bridge: Shwayze]
To all my Sally's out there
Put your hearts in the air
Tell me where you wanna go
And I'll take you there
I'll take you there
Girl I'll take you there
I'll take you there
To all my Sally's out there
Put your hearts in the air
Tell me where you wanna go
And I'll take you there
I'll take you there
Girl I'll take you there
I'll take you there

[Chorus: Cisco]
Sally is a hippie girl one day
Sally is a rock chick the next
Sally is a hip-hop baby
Then a trip, hot lady
But there's one thing Sally says everyday, and it's
She loves me
She loves me just the way I am
Yeah she loves me
She loves me just the way I am

I've been to Paris, London and still
I come back to Sally, cause I know how she feels

[Chorus: Cisco]
Sally is a hippie girl one day
Sally is a rock chick the next
Sally is a hip-hop baby
Then a trip, hot lady
But there's one thing Sally says everyday, and it's
She loves me
She loves me just the way I am
Yeah she loves me
She loves me just the way I am
