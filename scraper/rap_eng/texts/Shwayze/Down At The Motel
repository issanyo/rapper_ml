[Chorus: Shwayze & Cisco]
Down at the Motel
It's BYOB, so it don't matter if you ain't got a fake I.D
Down at the Motel
This party's for free, and your dude can come as long as he's got weed
Down at the Motel
So tell your girls, to tell mo girls
Down at the Motel
Come party with me, we gonna party like it's California...

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
We go town to town, show to show
You know the real fun starts when the curtains close
Head down the road, to the motel 6
Make a pit stop at the liquor store quick
Pick up a fifth, and some blunts to roll
Lookin' like a parade with all the chicks in tow
Sneak past the lobby, fast like Ricky Bobby
Strait to the pool, skinny dipping party!
After the show is the afterparty
And if you don't know where to go you better ask somebody
Or come with us we got room on the bus
We gonna show you how we get down

[Chorus: Shwayze & Cisco]
Down at the Motel
It's BYOB, so it don't matter if you ain't got a fake I.D
Down at the Motel
This party's for free, and your dude can come as long as he's got weed
Down at the Motel
So tell your girls, to tell mo girls
Down at the Motel
Come party with me, we gonna party like it's California...

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
And if you're down with down, let's go let's go
And I don't wanna hear a maybe, just a yes or a no
And you can bring your friend, if she leaves her clothes
Cause we ain't gonna need 'em where we going yo
At the hojo, or the holiday inn
I got some trees in the minibar, full of Gin
Goose and juice, and a little Patron
Let's get butt naked and bone
After the show is the afterparty
And if you don't know where to go you better ask somebody
Or come with us we got room on the bus
We gonna show you how we get down...
We gonna show you how we get down...

[Chorus: Shwayze & Cisco]
Down at the Motel
It's BYOB, so it don't matter if you ain't got a fake I.D
Down at the Motel
This party's for free, and your dude can come as long as he's got weed
Down at the Motel
So tell your girls, to tell mo girls
Down at the Motel
Come party with me, we gonna party like it's California...

[Bridge: Cisco]
It's 2 a.m
And the bar is closed
Where we gonna go now?
Tell your friends
And I'll tell my bros
Let's go back to the motel...

[Chorus: Shwayze & Cisco]
Down at the Motel
It's BYOB, so it don't matter if you ain't got a fake I.D
Down at the Motel
This party's for free, and your dude can come as long as he's got weed
Down at the Motel
So tell your girls, to tell mo girls
Down at the Motel
Come party with me, we gonna party like it's California...
Down at the Motel
Down at the Motel
