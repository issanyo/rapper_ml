[Chorus: Cisco]
Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl) (get dirty!)
Sure cleans up nice

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Yeah, high fashion, trash on the street
Studio apartment, Penthouse Suite
High Class, low life freak, but shit goes on like O-Bla-Di
Day and night she walk to the beat, no sleep and you gotta eat
Shake it like a tambourine, lemme taste it, little tangerine

Some girls like movie stars, some girls like cash and cars
Some girls like champagne, some girls like caviar
Some girls like other things, dont need no diamond rings
All my dirty girls sing:

[Chorus: Cisco]
Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl)
Sure cleans up nice

[Verse 2: Joey]
Yo, appetite for destruction she downtown hipster (?) and I'm Johnny Rotten
She's too punk for Manolo, we rock more plaid than a cholo and only roll dolo
I gotta left part, down for a solo, for you front stage, and no time for a no show
See I merely know your post in weights
(?) like cobra snake, um
You're the best
Thinking about you in the freeze frame, fashion
You're something like a frozen Kate Moss
Trapped in the glass
And all I really wanna do is tap that ass
Cause
Some girls like other things, dont need no diamond rings
Now all my dirty girls sing:

[Chorus: Cisco]
Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl)
Sure cleans up nice

Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl)
Sure cleans up nice

[Verse 3: Krispy]
In the verse, something mysterious, she looking better in the leather, I'm curious
How you got that ass..from your mom? I knew it. Face bomb, body and your mind, I blew it
Thin tight, them jeans skin tight
Finna bump that ass above the rib like
Cobay booty bubble like Rose
Them haters can't see me I'm the man with no face
Screwdrivers, vodka and OJ
Fresh prophylactic, the one with the gold papes
That's my dime chick, so even when we fuss, we make up
Hotter on her nose with no blush
Some girls like other things, dont need no diamond rings
All my dirty girls sing:

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

[Chorus: Cisco]
Dirty little girl in her dirty little life
Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind
Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies
My dirty little girl (girl)
Sure cleans up nice

[Outro:]
Hi, welcome to the Motel Sss....Ahh, Fuck
If it isn't Cheech and Chong
Well listen, if you're gonna stay here, I'm gonna need an $800 deposit this time
It took us two fucking days to get the weed smell out of that place
I'm not even gonna get started on the sheets
