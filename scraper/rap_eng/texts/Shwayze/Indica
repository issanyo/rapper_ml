You're like Indica
'Cause you're always tryna put me down
I need Sativa
[?]
I need to pick me up
To fight all these demons in my town
You're like Indica
But I'm not gonna let you keep me down

[Verse 1]
It's been downhill since you let me hit
A few highs, but mostly dips
Smoked all my weed prerequisite
First time you said "Love You", texted it
You're a social media specialist
Tinted tips for an Insta post
You're a duplicate like next to Kim
But you couldn't copy me, I can't coast

[Pre-Chorus]
I know my work, 'cause I put in work
Gave you love that you didn't earn
Your parents are rich as fuck
So you used to gettin' shit you don't deserve
Your negativity gets on my nerves
Every time you come to town I swerve
My grandma say you're a downer
I must say I concur

You're like Indica

I need to pick me up
To fight all these demons in my town
You're like Indica
But I'm not gonna let you keep me down

[Verse 2]
Why you tryna give me the okey-do?
And not like we ain't never spoke before
You need to calm down, you need to smoke a bowl
Why you always on paw patrol?
If I'm a dog or you're my bitch
And you get all mad, and you pitch a fit
I wish we could just be simple-est
Now everybody's lips is counterfeit

[Pre-Chorus]
I know my work, 'cause I put in work
Gave you love that you didn't earn
Yo, you're stuck up
So you used to gettin' shit you don't deserve
Your negativity gets on my nerves
Every time you come to town I swerve
My best friends say you're a downer
I must say I concur

Look
We say things we shouldn't say
My lemon haze were lemonade
I admit you're a train wreck
But I got you back like a rain check
You were stuck to me, like gorilla glue
And lovin' me, I was feelin' you
My little girl scout, I was an OG
Smokin' blue dream, out on the OC
You turned on me, like a [?]
Started to see not the [?]
LA yachts was the back trap
I gave you [?]
