[Hook : Austin Paul]
Do you believe in ghosts ?
Do you believe in fantasy ?
Can you take another dose ?
Step away from reality
You're my beautiful, the most
Mystery to all but me
Cause I believe in ghosts
I believe in fantasy

[Verse 1 : Shwayze]
I start lady, chillin with my family
As I do with dime and I wake up to a xanny
The jeans fit skinny, style fresh like many
I met her in LA then I hit that in Miami
Kicking games to my sons nanny
She got the booty, brought an ounce and some pirate's booty
In my tumi, mile high in my ray bans is this a movie
Either way when the plane lands, Imma do me
Eyes god lady, I'm stuntin like a ghost
Hearts black out when you see you should know
From the chicks on the beach to the G's selling dope
I do it for my coast, I do it for my folks
Eyes got lady, baby senorita
Black hearts, black sand sippin on the margarita
I do it for my folks, I do it for my cost
I do it cause, I do it cause I'm dope
