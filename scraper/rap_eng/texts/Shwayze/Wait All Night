[Verse 1: Shwayze]
You're a charm like the heart on your bracelet
The only star I see from my spaceship
From afar I could almost taste it
What it taste like? It tastes amazin'

Flash your break lights, i'll be patient
But the way you're lookin' at me is drivin' me cra-zy
Definitely maybe
I can't read the signs that you're sending me Baby

[Chorus: Cisco]
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
Just to watch you leave
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
Just to watch you leave

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Fire alarm goin' off in the basement
And I don't know how long I can take it
You're on my mind and I can't erase it
When I close my eyes, I see you naked
You impressed just a little bit, ain'tcha?
You can give me just a little kiss, Cain'tcha?
Tell your boyfriend you're puttin' on makeup
And meet me in the bathroom five minutes later

[Chorus: Cisco]
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
Just to watch you leave
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
Just to watch you leave

[Bridge: Shwayze]
You the lock, I'm the key
You the kick, I'm the snare, let's make a beat
Nothin' in this world is free, except love
And the air we breathe
Do you wanna dance with me?
And see where it goes from there mon cheri

Mon cheri, we can see where it goes from there mon cheri

[Chorus: Cisco]
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
Just to watch you leave
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
Just to watch you leave

[Verse 3: Tabi Bonney]
Say babe, I been lookin' for you since the Cassette tape days
Found me, then you pressed play
Had me waitin' for the next day
Stood me up like [?] with his shades
Hit me up with 'erry excuse to the point where what you say is a loop
And them otha' dudes fluke
I don't know why you datin' them
They lame like R&B groups
Say babe, Why you got me callin you my girl when you out here cheatin on mee?
All in the head of Tabi Bonney
But anyways.. I need a lover like you babe
Old school [?] and the hair like a toupee
[?] My time witchu pre paid
So sweet that soon I had no teeth
Ima buy you a candy bank if you be my girlfriend

[Chorus: Cisco]
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
Just to watch you leave
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
I don't wanna wait all night
Just to watch you leave
