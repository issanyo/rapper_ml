[Chorus]
I come and go like a boomerang
Set me free and ill come back again
To and fro like a freight train
Stop and lend yo time again
Verse 1
I'm dark in a place
Stuck in outer space
Talkin to my friends they dont know what i say
I'm in the ocean duck divin the waves
I'm on a mountain been climbin for days
"The top of the world is just up the way"
Said the blind man wavin the sage
Chapter 5, 29th page
Time ain't the only thing movin today
I gotta go, gotta get away
Let the sunset just set away
On the deck tryin to catch a wave
Some girl in a dress will say
"Please don't leave me" [x2]

[Chorus]
Verse 2
Stop and go, is this rock and roll?
Soul brotha on the yellow brick road
Dressed up ready to go
With my hair messed up in some regular clothes
Guess what, i'm strikin a pose
You could make a statue i suppose
Lights, camera, then i froze
Thoughts of you and my head arose
She loves me like a pedal on a rose
I love alot, last pedal on the floor
On the deck tryin to catch a wave
Some girl in a dress will say
"Please don't leave me" [x2]

[Chorus]
Woah oh, oh, oh, ooh
Verse 3
Believe me this time i'm leavin
For a little bit longer than a weekend
And when you see me ill be rockin
On yo tv, i know your watchin
And ill be thinking of you often
Put the top down and see a rose blossom
On the deck tryin to catch a wave
Some girl in a dress will say
"Please don't leave me" [x2]

[Chorus] [x2]
