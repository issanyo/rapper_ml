[Chorus : Devin K]
If diamonds didn't sparkle would you want em ?
If your clothes were cheap would you still flaunt em ?
If gold was only sand, would it matter in the palm of your hand ?
Ms. Fortune, five hundred, she could buy anything that she wanted
And this love is free, but she'd rather have the money than me

[Verse 1 : Shwayze]
I keep on hittin refresh up on your Insta, lookin at the same picture
And if you post another, best believe I ain't gon miss it
Still thinkin bout your kissin, reminiscing on our history
I should have paid attention, in high school during history
Cause it's always gon repeat, like the hook up on this beat
Before you loved the money I could swear that you loved me
That life you lead's expensive, but my lovin is free
Anything you want you'll get it but you'll never feel complete

[Chorus : Devin K]
If diamonds didn't sparkle would you want em ?
If your clothes were cheap would you still flaunt em ?
If gold was only sand, would it matter in the palm of your hand ?
Ms. Fortune, five hundred, she could buy anything that she wanted
And this love is free, but she'd rather have the money than me

[Post-Chorus: Devin K & Shwayze]
(Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)
(Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)

[Verse 2 : Shwayze]
Damn, that's really not feel enough
So many fish in the sea and that money's a good hook
If currency was currently about the talent
Then we wouldn't have to worry bout the commas in my balance
But when the label dropped me, all you did was copy
Trynna find the new Shway, but he's not me
I'll never be second cause second's way too sloppy
When all you did was doubt me, I just bounce back like Rocky
Don't know what you got til it's gone, hope those shopping sprees are good
Love defined in a dollar sign, I wish you understood
That life you lead's expensive, but my lovin is free
Anything you want you'll get it but you'll never feel complete

[Chorus : Devin K]
If diamonds didn't sparkle would you want em ?
If your clothes were cheap would you still flaunt em ?
If gold was only sand, would it matter in the palm of your hand ?
Ms. Fortune, five hundred, she could buy anything that she wanted
And this love is free, but she'd rather have the money than me

[Post-Chorus: Devin K & Shwayze]
(Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)
(Money over love, over love) She'd rather have the money than me (she chose money over love)

[Outro : Shwayze & Devin K]
Money over love, over love. She chose money over love
Money over love, over love. She chose money over love
She'd rather have the money than me
She'd rather have the money than me
But love makes you rich, don't you get it ?
