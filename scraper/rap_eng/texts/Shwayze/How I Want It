[Intro]
Just when I thought I got you, it was the same single moment realized that I lost you

[Chorus]
That's how I want it, that's how I really want it
You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning
Tryna give you all my loving but you ain't really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment

[Verse 1]
She's the life of the party, don't believe in karma
Every moment she's living is another that I'm done
She the life of the party, wanna take a bump and grind
But when she feeling naughty she hits me up every time

[Chorus]
That's how I want it, that's how I really want it
You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning
Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment

So I guess that's how I want it, that's how I really want it
You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning
Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment
So I guess that's how I want it...

[Post-Chorus]
You give me that love, and you give me that hate
Then I put that smile up on your face
The you say you gotta go but you always stay
Then we make that love till it's all okay
That's how I want it, that's how I really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment
So I guess that's how I want it

[Verse 2]
You were calling me sexy, and I really didn't mind
But now it's just messy because I'm wasting my time
You ain't looking for love, and neither was I
But a down ass chick is so hard to find
Roll the weed up, baby kick your feet up
They gon point and stare cause they all wanna be us
(It was the same single moment realized that I lost you)

[Chorus]
That's how I want it, that's how I really want it
You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning
Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment

So I guess that's how I want it, that's how I really want it
You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning
Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment
So I guess that's how I want it...

[Post-Chorus]
You give me that love, and you give me that hate
Then I put that smile up on your face
The you say you gotta go but you always stay
Then we make that love till it's all okay
That's how I want it, that's how I really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment
So I guess that's how I want it

[Interlude]
I want it, I, I, I want it
I want it, I, I, I want it right now
I want it, I, I, I want it
I want it, I, I, I want it right now
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it right now
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it...

[Chorus]
That's how I want it, that's how I really want it
You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning
Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment

So I guess that's how I want it, that's how I really want it
You call me when you want it and you're gon' in the morning
Tried to give you all my loving but you ain't really want it
Ain't thinking 'bout the future, only living in the moment
So I guess that's how I want it...
