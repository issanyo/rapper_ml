There's a long line of mourners
Driving down our little street
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see, oh yea
They're all your rich friends who knew you in the city
And now they've finally brought you
Brought you home to me
Fancy Cars
Yeah uh yea
A fancy car ain't what i need
I need a girl in some skinny jeans
An oversized tshirt that reads "whatever happened to american dreams"
Shwayze-
Headphones bumpin fly beats
The card in my wallet says i can buy weed
Strike a pose like i know thai chi
The high life treats me nicely
California love long island iced tea
The girls in the city are a bit pricey
What up to my ladies out in jersey
And my dirty girls in duke university
Most certainly i've been lucky
Fell in love two times in kentucky
And dressed up like rick james in london
Nicknamed my chick champagne cuz she's bubbly
Lovely pretty bumblebee suckle honey
Peanut butter dreams with the strawberry jelly
(fancy cars) drivin down my street
(fancy cars) ain't shit to me
(fancy cars) ain't what i need x2
Cisco-
Yeah she was the apple of my eye
The cherry in my pie
My little crab cake loved to cry
She said shes gonna move out to NY
I said why she said to get fly
I said ok babe do your thing
I'll be right here when you're back again
She said she comin back in a limousine
I said pick me up on the scene
When you drive through in your escalade
Like the president on election day
Say hey, peanut butter dreams and strawberry jelly
X3
Come on lets go
I got places to be i got people to meet i got things to see
I got thing do i got things to do i got things to do
(i gotta go baby) and if you want i'll do them with you
(i mean you could come if you want)but you gotta promise that you'll be true (be true no lies)
Oh yeah oh yeah (get on the freeway man and uh we just keep on goin because its me and you and you my rich girl)
Fade out
