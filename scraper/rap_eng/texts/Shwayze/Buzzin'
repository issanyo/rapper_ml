[Hook: Cisco Adler]
I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Bang bang, baby shot me in the heart
In the dark with the dart felt the spark when it hit
When we me at the spot it was hot, like this song
Saw the thong, it was on, now it's 8 in the mornin'
I move on like the Greyhound bus
I go, town to town, and I prey on sluts
I gotta go, so scream out your area code
I'm comin' all the way live from the 3-1-O
I gotta whole lot of love, but none like you
You make me wanna stay here in heaven with you
I'll write your name in the sand, put your hand with mine
Come on baby, shoot your gun in the sky

[Hook: Cisco Adler]
I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar
And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was (I think she did)
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love (yeah)

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Bang bang, baby hit me one time
Two days on the road and you're still on my mind
You'd think that I would learn 'cause I'm young and fine
But I'm broke so I'm tryna make a hustle outta rhyme
I gotta see the world, one girl at a time
But you're hangin' on my sleeve like I care that you're cryin'
And I do, I'm just tryna play it cool
I got a rep to protect down at the high school
Why you tryna cage me in?
And when I leave we both know you'll be pagin' him
And when I come back, we gon' do it again
I promise we gon' do it again

[Hook: Cisco Adler]
I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar (do it again)
And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was (do it again)
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love (yeah)

[Verse 3: Shwayze]
Bang bang, I wanna give you my name
But I'm tryna put some diamonds in my Shwayze chain
Babies change, they start showin' them fangs
Tryna take a ride on this crazy train
Choo choo, what the hell am I to do?
I got a girl in every city from here to Peru
When I left you, I signed my name on your left boob
Now go get that tattoed, I'll be back soon
Don't cry, I'll bless you with a text soon
I gotta go, but I'll be back next June
Or July, sparks in the sky
She said, "Boy you crazy"
Nah, I'm Shwayze

[Hook: Cisco Adler]
I met her at a backyard blockparty by the bar (do it again)
And she kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was (do it again)
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love

[Outro: Cisco Adler]
And I don't know what she was on
Whatever it was, I want some
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me
She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love
