[Verse 1: Shwayze & Cisco]
She on that full moon, night crawler
Blood stain on my collar (uh, uh)
She's a man eater (uh)
Nails scratching on my back
No escaping her attack (uh, uh)
She's a man eater, eater
Like a stalker, with a knife
Code like rocker on the ice
Spiked heels, neon lights
Turn your back and that supersize
Man eater, she's a man eater, damn

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive (alive)
(I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive.)
I was a fool to think that I'd be alright, tonight
She's a man eater (hey) and I can't beat her (oh)
'Cause I've had a few drinks and I can't see her (hey, oh)
I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive (tonight)
She's a man eater, man, I don't need to feed the man eater
(yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Shwayze & Cisco]
Shit on that lovey dove, cuddle bug, baby wanna cut me up
She's a man eater
She don't wanna talk it out, she's all about that chew me up and spit me out shit
She's a man eater, eater
One more shot and I'm blacking out
Don't know what she talkin' 'bout
Don't wanna wake up at a house
Butt naked, ass out
Damn, musta passed out
Damn, musta passed out

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive (alive)
(I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive.)
I was a fool to think that I'd be alright, tonight
She's a man eater (hey) and I can't beat her (oh)
'Cause I've had a few drinks and I can't see her (hey, oh)
I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive (tonight)
She's a man eater, man, I don't need to feed the man eater

[Bridge: Shwayze]
She up in the club, like a DJ
Scratchin' me up, instant replay
Backin' me up, in the corner
And I want her, but I know I'm gon' regret it in the morning

She up in the club, like a DJ
Scratchin' me up, instant replay
Backin' me up, in the corner
And I want her, but I know I'm gon' regret it in the morning

[Pre-Chorus: Cisco]
I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive
(In the morning, in the morning, in the morning, in the morning)
I was a fool to think that I'd be alright...

[Chorus & Outro: Cisco & Shwayze]
She's a man eater (hey) and I can't beat her (oh)
'Cause I've had a few drinks and I can't see her (hey, oh)
I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive
She's a man eater, man, I don't need to feed the man eater
I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive (alive)
(I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive.)
I was a fool to think that I'd be alright, tonight
She's a man eater (hey) and I can't beat her (oh)
'Cause I've had a few drinks and I can't see her (hey, oh)
I don't know if I'll ever make it out alive (tonight)
She's a man eater, man, I don't need to feed the man eater
