Uh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Certainly you should be filled with uncertainty
For 13 years I've been hurtin girls purposely
I've been called a worthless freak a jerk and a cheat
Cause I turn the other cheek after we fuck for a week
Stop crying you know that I done learn from these mistakes that I've made
But the past keeps burnin me like meatheads with cigarettes or freshmens in fraternities
But Shwayze say how bout burnin' herbal trees with purple leaves

I'm sorry that I hurt your heart
But that's just the part that you're playin' in my autobiography
I'm sorry that I did you wrong
I promise that I'll write a song
And play it for you as my apology

[Chrous: Cisco]
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight

[Verse 2]
You know what, maybe girl. You wasn't meant to be my baby girl
Shwayze's just a player and my stage is his crazy world
But lately lovely I've been thinking of you all the time
All my friends say I gotta put it all far behind
But I don't mind they just jealous you get all my time
I saw the signs you my ace of bass
Damn you fine
You got Shwayze shakin' the rattle
Crying like a baby Cause I'm sleepless in Seattle
While you in Hollywood
Longs legs short skirt
Tellin' all the dudes how you made my feelings hurt

[Chrous: Cisco]
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight

Dance in the sand
We gonna dance in the sand

[Verse 3]
Dance in the sand
Like a street fighting Sam
Yes am I what I am
What I am is a man
We gonna dance in the sand
Dance in the sand tonight
Dance in the sand cause we ain't got a plan
Two peas in a pod you and I me and you
And love is a bitch
Let's hold hands. Let's get rich
Romance in the stone
Make a home outta house
Build a rome in a day
You know what they say
Every pimp needs a ho and lady

We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon'dance in the sand tonight
(Every pimp needs a ho)
We gon' walk in the twilight
We gon' run in the moonshine
We gon' dance in the sand tonight
(every pimp needs a ho)
