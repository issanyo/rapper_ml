[Intro: Shwayze]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't miss you
I'mma dismiss you
I'mma kiss you, next time I see you
It's true

[Chorus: Cisco]
Give me all your lovin', give me all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'mma be alright, I'mma be alright

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Seventeen, hero beauty queen introduced to me
She in the Hollywood scene
Moved to Cali from NYC
It's been eight months and she ain't happy
A couple shots of Patron, she eased the pain
Chased it with some Jack just to smile again
The everyday routine
Of a broken teen who left her heart close to where she left her dreams:
Hidden, tucked away so far now they missing
I took her hand and said baby listen
For every moment you waste, there's another right behind it to take its place
Cause life goes on when it ain't so sweet
Don't give up on me
Get back on your feet
If you can take another breath you gon' be okay
Just smile, forget yesterday

[Chorus: Cisco]
Give me all your lovin', give me all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'mma be alright, I'mma be alright
Cause all I need is a bag of weed
And a lazy Susan, so I can watch my TV

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
In the mall's where I met her
Wearing a brown sweater
She said she had a man
But I said I could do it better
My name is Shwayze, she responded with I'm Loretta
What a beautiful name, she said what beautiful game
One conversation lead to another
On to some drinks, now we fucking each other
Constant sex turn to constant text
Saying how much she missed me
Wishing she could be with me
Damn, I made her cheat on her man
What makes me think she won't be cheating again
I just said never mind, yeah I miss you too
Give me a sec and I roll on through
Days turn to week, now holding hands and kissing cheeks
Using nicknames, spittin' game is obsolete
Damn, don't do to me what you did before
I just kept my mouth shut and we fucked some more

Yeah

[Chorus: Cisco]
Give me all your lovin', give me all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'mma be alright, I'mma be alright
Cause all I need is a bag of weed
And a lazy Susan, so I can watch my TV

[Verse 3: Shwayze]
I've given too many chances to exotic dancers
Asking too many questions and receiving no answers
Investing my finances on pills for enhancement
Even got some facial cream so they could think I was handsome
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrrre
Yeah, you're right baby but how am I gonna fuck her?
It seems nowadays that's our only motive
And we're going to the first date without a trojan

[Chorus & Outro: Cisco]
Give me all your lovin', give me all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'mma be alright, I'mma be alright
Cause all I need is a bag of weed
And a lazy Susan, so I can watch my TV
Lazy Susan lying right here next to me
Lying right here next to me
Lying right here next to me
Lying right here next to me
Lying right here next to me
