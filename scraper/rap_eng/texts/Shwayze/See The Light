[Intro : Shwayze]
Shway. Let's go !

[Verse 1 : Shwayze]
Uh ! You're a fairy tale
I wanna get to know you very well
The club is packed and the music's bumping
So it's kinda hard for me to tell you something
Your legs are long like a limousine
My life's a movie you my favorite scene
I'm directing, I ain't gonna say cut
You so sexy how you move your butt
Oh ! So you know my ex and coincidentally she from Texas
I'm kissing your neck with no regrets
But it's like an interview with these 20 questions
What's my age ? What's my sign ?
I wanna take you out the back through the exit sign
We ain't gotta rush, we can take our time
I just want you to be mine (Let's go)

[Hook : Marco]
Where do you go ? I know you're feeling alone
Can I get you next to me tonight ?
Just let it all go, and lose all control
And I'm hoping you can see the light
Wanna take away the problems that you came with
I'm a show you how to look the other way when
You're up in the zone, and there's nobody home
Better close your eyes and realize
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh...
Can I get you next to me tonight ?
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh...
And I'm hoping you can see the light

[Verse 2 : Shwayze]
Oh you're girlfriend like me ? Ya she's real cute
But she ain't my style cause she just ain't you
There ain't too much that us two can't do
You're a piece of art, let me finger paint you
I'm a gemini so I'll double date you
Mke you laugh, and I'll make you think too
Buy you clothes, I ain't trying to change you
Strike a pose I wish I could frame you
Uh ! Staring up at the city lights
I wanna hide behind your eyes pretty lights
I can tell you them many lies
You ain't tripping off drama and petty lies
Free falling like a pretty song
We can take another shot but I'm already gone
You a star shining bright like the sun right
Cause I finally see the light

[Hook : Marco]
Where do you go ? I know you're feeling alone
Can I get you next to me tonight ?
Just let it all go, and lose all control
And I'm hoping you can see the light
Wanna take away the problems that you came with
I'm a show you how to look the other way when
You're up in the zone, and there's nobody home
Better close your eyes and realize
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh...
Can I get you next to me tonight ?
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh...
And I'm hoping you can see the light
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh...
Can I get you next to me tonight ?
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh...
And I'm hoping you can see the light

[Outro : Marco]
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh...
Can I get you next to me tonight ?
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh...
I'm hoping you can see the light
