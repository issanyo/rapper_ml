[Chorus]
This heartbreak is better than most loves
Cuz even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up

[Verse]
You're hot like cashmere, I don't need that beer
Drunk off your love and I'm cool chillin' right here
In school you never would've talked to me
It's cool 'cause now you're gettin' lost with me
Your body is just like an hourglass (hourglass)
It's crazy how quick an hour pass (hour pass)
Know were having fun thinking about the times we had
'Cause even when the times were bad

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't forget it, making love in public
Let them all see, fuck it
They search the world to find something like this
Forget it, makin' love in public
Let them all see, fuck it
They search the world to find something like this

[Chorus]
Heartbreak is better than most loves
'Cause even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
This heartbreak is better than most loves
'Cause even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up

[Verse]
She like her man happy, tatted, ashy to classy
Knew she was the one right when she walked past me
Take a hand baby let's get out of here
Black man, your daddy's worst nightmare
I'm crazy, but you want it like I want it baby
I'm coming for your lovin'
Thinkin' about the times we had
'Cause even when the times were bad

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't forget it, makin' love in public
Let them all see, fuck it
They search the world to find something like this
Forget it, makin' love in public
Let them all see, fuck it
They search the world to find something like this

[Chorus]
Heartbreak is better than most loves
'Cause even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
This heartbreak is better than most loves
'Cause even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up

[Pre-Chorus]
Makin' out in public
My chick is high so fuck it
Who are they to judge us
Partyin' for days now
Baby let's just lay down
Who are they to judge us
They just mad 'cause they ain't us

[Chorus]
They search the world to find something like this
Heartbreak is better than most loves
'Cause even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up
This heartbreak is better than most loves
'Cause even when we break up
Our heartbreak is better than most loves
Even when we break up girl
