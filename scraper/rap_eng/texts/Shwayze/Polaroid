[Chorus: Cisco]
So someone take her picture
(click, click)
So I don't forget her
(click, click)
I wish I had a Polaroid
(click, click)
So I could remember
(click, click)

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Yo, at a party on the hill, I popped a pill
Threw back a shot and started to chill
Ran into a pretty thing named jane bang
She said she liked the way I handled my game
I said thanks, I like the way you handle my thang
She said thanks, now thats money in the bank
So I walked away, towards the bar
Bumped into a hottie named holly in the hall
Could've been a mange e toi
But her friend never heard my music before
So I walked outside to get a little high
When I got a little bump on my side from a fly
Blue-eyed baby with sex on the mind
Sally's form the valley, but sally's still fine
Hopped in the ride, and started to drive
She said whats my name
I said "i dunno, jane?"

[Chorus: Cisco]
So someone take her picture
(click, click)
So I don't forget her
(click, click)
I wish I had a Polaroid
(click, click)
So I could remember
(click, click)

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Yo, uh, at a party on the beach
I was smokin like cheech
Scopin out a hot piece of ass I'm a creep
Getting head while the radio speaks
Popped like the bubble in these sneaks
Yo Jennifer, it wasn't Monique
That chick got dolphins tattooed on her feet
Last week, I seen a best friend
Undressin a madison in the west end
Exit, cut to breakfast
Eggs Benidict and a fresh pearl necklace
Legs in the air like a goddamn gymnast
Please God, I beg for forgiveness
Then she asked if I've been in Memphis
I said no but I'm a fan of Elvis
Thats where I learned to move my pelvis
She said whats my name
I said "Jane?"

[Chorus: Cisco]
So someone take her picture
(click, click)
So I don't forget her
(click, click)
I wish I had a Polaroid
(click, click)
So I could remember
(click, click)

[Verse 3: Shwayze]
Yeah, yo, uh at a party at my crib, I can't remember what I did
Woke up with a semi-hard dick and a fat chick
Three days a week, call that a hat trick
But everybody knows hockey ain't for black kids
They call me Shwayze, kinda like Patrick
Pinnin every dome in Hollywood to the mattress
Sin in every city, LA to Manhattan
Grinnin like I'm guilty, but I dunno what happened

[Chorus: Cisco & Shwayze]
So someone take her picture
(click, click)
They call me Shwayze, kinda like Patrick
So I don't forget her
(click, click)
They call me Shwayze, kinda like Patrick
I wish I had a Polaroid
(click, click)
So I can remember
They call me Shwayze, kinda like Patrick
They call me Shwayze

[Chorus & Outro: Cisco]
So someone take her picture
So I don't forget her
I wish I had a Polaroid
So I could remember
So someone take her picture
So I don't forget her
I wish I had a Polaroid
So I could remember
So someone take her picture
So I don't forget her
I wish I had a Polaroid
So I could remember
So someone take her picture
So I don't forget her
I wish I had a Polaroid
So I could remember
