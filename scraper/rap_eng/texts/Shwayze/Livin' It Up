[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Shwayze]
I know you gonna hate on this
A was up ya'll no matter what it is you trying to do there's always gonna be somebody trying to hate on you but that don't stop what we do
Living it up

[Chorus: Cisco]
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
And I didn't pay for this drink in my cup (hell yea)
Yea yea that's whats up I'm the shit so light some matches up
Came a long way from bucks serving latte's all day in my chucks
(can I help you)
A little green on my break for lunch
Got me thinkin about ways to get out of the rough I'm not paid but I made in enough
For haters to hate and try to call my bluff
Well here it is my sophomore slum
And don't get mad when your girl turn it up

[Chorus: Shwayze]
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it good
And you just hating cause you wish you could

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Oh this is my time to shine
Every where I go is free corona and lime
Came a long way from Myspace now girls wanna shoot at my place
Dam sure put a smile on my face
And to all the haters thanks for watching
I'm not paid but I made in enough
For haters to hate and try to call my bluff
And don't get mad when your girl turn it up turn it up don't get mad when your girl turn it up

[Chorus: Shwayze]
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Psychedelic colors on that range rover door like dam can a young nigga make money anymore
I got a gang of chip fresh of the porch is Compton new crew off the Mercedes floor
World wide nigga making paper of tour I don't wash shit I just change in the store you can hate nigga I gotta make more so watch me live it up I got to give it up
You gotta hate on whats great
That don't stop what we do

[Chorus & Outro: Shwayze]
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Why you hating I'm living it up I I I I'm living it up
Hey oh hey oh hey oh hey oh hey oh hey oh
