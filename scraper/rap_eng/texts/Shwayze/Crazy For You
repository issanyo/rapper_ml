[Verse 1: Shwayze]
I was born to rock, learned to walk in flip flops
And I bought my clothes at the local thrift shop
I wouldn't be late if I looked at the clock
But I'd rather spend time than by a wrist watch
Zip-lock keep it fresh. Red Hot Chili Pep
Dread lock rosta
I was high when we met, but I remember everything from your eyes to your dress
Sun rise on the east when it sets on the west side
Let the guitar play. Yeah, let's vibe
Forget the bad days, think about the good times
The Pimp C's at the Hollywood go, where is my mind?
I just don't know
Life goes so fast then it goes too slow
Had to join a band to discover the flow
But ay yo I got two tickets to the rock show
Dead center front row

[Chorus: Cisco]
I wanna take you out to the rock show baby
Make you understand what makes me
And if you want I will go crazy for you
(if you wanna go crazy girl) oh oh (then you can be my baby girl)

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
Before I drove I walked, kicking rocks in the park
Kick flip and drop shooting hoops on the black top
I still remember when the joints were skinny
Way before I had a penny and Lenny chopped his dread locks
Late night, I listened to the tape box till the daylight come and
I break off to find a girl so I could sing a love song in her ear
And tell her where we go from here
Get the guitar baby play let's drop
Forget the bad days, think about the good times
Make love every night like the first night
And dance in the sand, like its our birth right
Live it up cause it may not last
Life goes too slow then it goes too fast
Had to see the future to discover the past
So if you wanna go here's a backstage pass

[Chrous & Outro: Cisco]
I wanna take you out to the rock show baby
Make you understand what makes me
And if you want I will go crazy for you
(if you wanna go crazy girl) oh oh (then you can be my baby girl)
I wanna take you out to the rock show baby
Make you understand what makes me
And if you want I will go crazy for you
Oh oh (yeah you could be my baby girl)
I wanna take you out to the rock show baby
Make you understand what makes me
And if you want I will go crazy for you
Oh oh. oh ooooh ohhhh
If you want I will go crazy
If you want I will go crazy
If you want I will go crazy for youuuuu
Oh ooooh ohhhh
