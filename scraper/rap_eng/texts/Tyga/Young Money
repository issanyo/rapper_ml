Ha!
Tyga
One verse wouldn't hurt.,
Pharell said fuck ya' niggas
Ha ha ha, shame on you bitch
Let the streets know
Let the streets know

[Verse 1] Tyga
Who the hottest niggas out boy, young money
We could buy you niggas out if we really wanted
Car transformin, the grill george foreman
What i paid for was your house plus mortgage
Rap borin' and you niggas ain't even tourin'
I just bought a fly bitch now that bitch tourin
My swag soarin sharper than source award wards is
Award me best horror Tyga monster
Willy wonk ya welcome to my chocolate fuckers

Cherry pop em' like bubble wrap in the boxes
That girl boppa be tweetin all the homies watch her
Binoculars the only way you gone see me partner
My life is awsome i'm on so you know she off one
I'm in zone home girl stop cock blockin'
Bitch roosters on my watch rubies tick tockin'
Young money goblins we are a fuckin' problem

[hook] Tyga
Bitch im young money, Bitch im young money
Bitch im young money, Bitch im young money
Bitch im young money, Bitch im young money
Bitch im young money, Bitch im young money
Bitch im young money, Bitch im young
