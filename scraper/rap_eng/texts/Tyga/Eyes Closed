[Chorus]
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Gotta see you bounce it, so bounce with the lights on
It's you that my eyes on
I can count with my eyes closed
You see I'm in my zone
See you a hoe through a blindfold
I'm serious 'bout jewelry, my nigga
We know that them rhinestones
You know this shit diamond
Gettin' this money you count it
I can count with my eyes closed
I can hold it and know it

[Verse 1]
No coke on my nose
Got coke on my floor
My bro's get a drug charge
We ain't paranoid
We know they gon' doubt us
So we show up with dice on
She know that I get it, I got it (ooh)
You see this shit I'm on?

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you know how to count it?
Can you count with your eyes closed?
One eye like cyclops
Keep your eye on the rifle
Keep your hand on the Bible
I know that he watching, he know that I'm sinnin', he gimme no options
Just look at my watch, you can tell that I'm clockin' (woo)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Gotta see you bounce it, so bounce with the lights on
It's you that my eyes on
I can count with my eyes closed
You see I'm in my zone
See you a hoe through a blindfold
I'm serious 'bout jewelry, my nigga
We know that them rhinestones
You know this shit diamond
Gettin' this money you count it
I can count with my eyes closed
I can hold it and know it

[Verse 2]
Now pour up the Moet
Go slow when you pour it
We was poor
Now take this money and blow it
She can't sleep without it
She lay with her eyes open
She rub with her thighs open
But I'm late at the condo
Can't leave 'til I count it
I count with my eyes closed
Money talk, but it sing to me
All it hit is high notes
All I got is hunnids
Recycle, recycle
More paper, more paper (shit)
Gettin' richer like Lionel
Fiesta, fiesta
I got rhythm like Lionel
Do you know how to count it?
You know your times tables?
My chain when they make an announcement
Sayin' I'm out here
I know that you see me
If you could, you'd be me (cyeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you know how to count it?
Can you count with your eyes closed?
One eye like cyclops
Keep your eye on the rifle
Keep your hand on the Bible
I know that he watchin'
He know that I'm sinnin', he gimme no options
I took off the top now back to the topic

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Gotta see you bounce it, so bounce with the lights on
It's you that my eyes on
I can count with my eyes closed
You see I'm in my zone
See you a hoe through a blindfold
I'm serious 'bout jewelry, my nigga
We know that them rhinestones
You know this shit diamond
Gettin' this money you count it
I can count with my eyes closed
I can hold it and know it

[Outro]
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Gotta see you bounce it, so bounce with the lights on
It's you that my eyes on
I can count with my eyes closed
You see I'm in my zone
See you a hoe through a blindfold
I'm serious 'bout jewelry, my nigga
We know that them rhinestones
You know this shit diamond
Gettin' this money you count it
I can count with my eyes closed
I can hold it and know it
