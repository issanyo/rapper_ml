[Intro]
Uh, I dont compete, I dominate (dominate)
I concentrate (concentrate)
I strategize, I execute, I pow, pow, pow, pow
I annihilate, on my tenth Cartier
Still ain't got time to waste
Where you want to go? I got the pilot waiting

[Verse]
Thats my Teterboro flow
Please keep it low
I wrote up all my raps
You still can't see the flow
Been so high all week my nigga
I still ain't seen the flow
This bitch keep talkin' crazy
I'ma be reachin' through the phone
Ho that's my Teterboro flow
You was in Costa Rica though
She was skiing down the slopes
She was leakin' out her nose
She was leakin' out her clothes
She was reachin' for my woah
I ain't sayin' she a ho
But there's things you need to know
This my Teterboro flow, brr, millimetre flow
My security a loc, your security a joke
I mean, I ain't laughed that hard, shit
Since the last time I seen your ho
And the last time I seen your ho
I only seen her throat
This my Teterboro, your European pearl
I'm from Diddy era
Biggie Jesus piece starin' at me
Give me one more Carrera (baby)
Petey Pablo flows freaky leaky hoes
Lamborghinis and corsos
Where you wanna go? where you wanna go?
This my Teterboro flow, haha
Stop comparing me to those
Rich for like two years nigga
Hit me in a few years nigga
Hit me a few Coupes later
New cribs and new views later
See all my old bitches, just give me new haters
Nigga, I'm where the verse start
Yeah bitch, I'm the one
Time I could get at y'all bitches
I give to my son, I give him my love
I give him my ribs, I give him my lungs
I live on the run
I stand in one place for a month straight
And still give 'em a run
For my Teterboro flow, please keep it low
I'm taking the game nigga
This my Liam Neeson flow
We was eating pizza rolls
We was sleepin' on the floor
You was sleepin' on the floor
Now I'm paranoid in my mansion
Got me peekin' through the door
Thats my Teterboro flow
Steven Victor know
Keep the ace in the ho
Brr, millimeter flow
My security a loc
I wrote all my raps for you
You can still see the flow
She think my house is haunted
I know you see the ghost
I'm the f-fire man, nigga y'all want no smoke
Nigga stuntin' all I know, frontin' is all you do
Nigga I ain't talk to the po', but I'm with the boys in blue
This my Teterboro, been thorough
I'm a specialist need a referral
I'm a sick shit, need a V12
Pop a pill, that's a D12, shit, ha
T-t-teterboro-boro-boro flow, flow, flow
If you ain't know-know, now you know nigga

[Outro]
Uh, I dont compete, I dominate (dominate)
I concentrate (concentrate)
I strategize, I execute, I pow, pow, pow, pow
Brr, I annihilate, on my tenth Cartier
Still ain't got time to waste
Brr
