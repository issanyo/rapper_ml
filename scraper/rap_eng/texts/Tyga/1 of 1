[Hook]
You, you my only one
You my number one
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one, and I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

[Verse 1]
Back to the front with you
Don't let 'em make you regret it
They'll be fake if you let 'em
Don't let 'em make less out of something
That means so much to you
I wanna make you feel comfortable
Girl you know I fuck with you
Like summer school and Lunchables
We the untouchable, yeah
You don't have to suffer, no, yeah
I was made custom for you
Only give my loving to you

[Hook]
You my only one
You my number one
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one, and I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

[Verse 2]
Take the thug in me and put some in you
Now you wearing bandanas
Rocking your man's flannels
Flight to Dubai, gotta pop a Xanax
Mi no love for dem batty boy antics
Gon' make me pull choppers out the attic
I'm a savage, straight savage
Yeah, they laughed at my dreams of living lavish
We no pretender, we both remember
All these hoes was ghost 'fore I had the Phantom
'Fore I had the 'Gram, I couldn't get at 'em
Uh, before I rocked rings like Saturn
They ain't wanna hang out, wanna try to plan it
That's why I give all I have to you
They don't know I got the juice, they don't know
They don't know I touch the money like masseuse
(Dem don't know) I was made custom for you
Only giving my love to you

[Hook]
You, you my only one
You, you a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one
You, you a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you

[Outro]
Back to the front with you
Yeah, grind and bump with you
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
Back to the front with you
Don't have to front, it's true
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one with you
One on one with you
One on one
And I want you to want me too
You a one of one
I wanna go one on one  with you
