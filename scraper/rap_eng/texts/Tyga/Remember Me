[Intro]
Many niggas gonna see I'm a G
Bet you bitches gon' remember me

[Verse 1]
Needs no muthafuckin' intro
As I walk with the swagga like I'm 6'4
Skinny nigga doe
Fresh like Mentos
Look at me real close
Rap nigga been in Vogue, ha
But I neva pose but I make hoes, Marilyne Monroe
Strip down, no clothes
Bring it back like six fo' Nintendo's
Blow! On my holy O' catch the holy ghost
Damn! Listen to the sound, metal rounds
Never play around
Kid, I'm no playground
Niggas puppy chow, eatin' with they face down
Niggas try to tell, one shot kill
Now who you gon' tell, nigga?

[Hook]
When the night comes and the sun falls
Bet you bitches gon' remember me
So turn the lights off then turn the lights on
Then you niggas gon' see I'm a G

[Verse 2]
I feel badder like I'm leather on Jackson
Red Devil Porche turn, sex on the beach burns
You can smell it like incense in the air
Air, I pronounce wor' and announce world
Like I'm teachers through yo speakers
You fuckin' with a Tiger, bite through first
Burberry hair, bird bath, blood now
It's a vampire shirt
Cough and cemetery the verse
Flow so sick that it hurts
Truth be told, wardrobe like movie clothes
My life front row and you sittin' too close

[Hook]
When the night comes and the sun falls
Bet you bitches gon' remember me
So turn the lights off then turn the lights on
Then you niggas gon' see I'm a G

[Verse 3]
Floss gettin' em like Denis where I'm from
Kick-backs ain't fun, when you gettin' kicked up
Sorry I got temper, hotter than magenta
Flame color menstrual, period, Redrum
Better pray like Nuns cause you don't want none
Buck! Buck! Two at pedestrians
I don't give a fuck, straight shit on a bum
What's up? My mind like a lugnut, don't fucking screw up!

[Hook]
When the night comes and the sun falls
Bet you bitches gon' remember me
So turn the lights off then turn the lights on
Then you niggas gon' see I'm a G
