Let's play black car, black Audemar
For the love of money I'mma die hard
Fuckin role model, tell these bitches that play your part
I blew off off one tape, got take it now, I'm a movie star

Phone calls, my language off
Old school like coolie high
Your bitch, she get sodomized
My money blink like lawyer's eyes
These niggas telling like all lies
Said they want beef but they French fries
I'm hot poppin, nigga deep fried
These bitches sweatin me, perspire

Tell a nigga: she want china, she will turn you out
Had a white bitch like no doubt
Busting nuts for 4 hours
I'm on the jet getting drugged out
Dro the face, her tongue out
I'm throwin money like paper routes
My flow hard like the workout

She eat pussy, cat down
Can't see me, back round
School niggas, cap gaw
Click clack, smoking cloud
Lumberjack, tall niggas
Paul Bunyon I wish you were
All my niggas like Tray Vonn
Ready to gut their hood

Ball hard, no fucking catch
My shit real, yo figures wax
Yo Rollie ain't Rolex
Like mankind get sucked next
We don't fuck with P90X
Cause all my niggas they do is flex
My car made for races
Like to fuck with rednecks

I'm on some different shit. Hop out then I pull up
Motherfuckin little Mickey icy like cooler
I don't need no help
Never fuck with no tutors
Talkin all that head, blow me and your medulla

T-Raww, I'm steppin out
Bill money I'm handing out
I ain't scared of yall niggas, Manny Pacquaio
Strip search, I pat her down
Wiz Khalifa, I'm smoking loud
Like ASAP I got a fuckin problem
Fuckin problem, I'm a problem child
Woop
