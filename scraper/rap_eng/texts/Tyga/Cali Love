[Intro: Sabi]
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Cali love

[Chorus: Sabi]
My top down on my jeep
Rollin' the cali streets
My music turnt up, my crew mobbin' like what
Singing, "La la la la la la la la la la la la, Cali Love!"
My top down in my hood
Them boys lookin', what's good?
My crew stay turnt up, my girls mobbin' like what
Singing, "La la la la la la la la la la la la, Cali Love!"

[Verse 1: Sabi]
My crew mobbin', I'm hot
Ray Bans and my flip flops
Gold all in my wrist watch
Pool parties on roof tops
They got trees and you know this
Sit back cause they rollin' that
La la la la la la la la la la

[Pre-Chorus: Sabi]
That California sun
Bring that West Coast love
Won't you come and get some of that California dreamin'?

[Chorus: Sabi]
My top down on my jeep
Rollin' the cali streets
My music turnt up, my crew mobbin' like what
Singing, "La la la la la la la la la la la la, Cali Love!"
My top down in my hood
Them boys lookin', what's good?
My crew stay turnt up, my girls mobbin' like what
Singing, "La la la la la la la la la la la la, Cali Love!"

[Verse 2: Sabi]
We still mobbin', I'm hot
Zuma Beach and my sunblock
I'm heading to my night spot
City lights in my backdrop
We cruisin' down my block
Bobbin' heads to that 2Pac, like
La la la la la la la la la la

[Pre-Chorus: Sabi]
That California sun
Bring that West Coast love
Won't you come and get some of that California dreamin'?

[Chorus: Sabi]
My top down on my jeep
Rollin' the cali streets
My music turnt up, my crew mobbin' like what
Singing, "La la la la la la la la la la la la, Cali Love!"
My top down in my hood
Them boys lookin', what's good?
My crew stay turnt up, my girls mobbin' like what
Singing, "La la la la la la la la la la la la, Cali Love!"

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Palm trees, sex on the beach
Corvette, leather seats
My queen awaits and I'm wide awake cause I'm the king
It's like a chess game and I'm playing for keeps
Pop that top for me, then I'm gonna make that pussy leak
She called me baby boy, no Tyreese
I beat it up like Ali Rodney, king me
You everywhere you ain't supposed to be
So get close to me and it rose on me, grow on me
We can take off for weeks
I'm top down and riding on the sunset
And turn the music down cause I'm turned up
Bet she ain't gonna walk the same man
Bet she ain't gonna talk the same way
When she gets a taste of LA

[Chorus: Sabi]
My top down on my jeep
Rollin' the cali streets
My music turnt up, my crew mobbin' like what
Singing, "La la la la la la la la la la la la, Cali Love!"
My top down in my hood
Them boys lookin', what's good?
My crew stay turnt up, my girls mobbin' like what
Singing, "La la la la la la la la la la la la, Cali Love!"
