Where to begin when love ends on a bad note
Or being honest make the trust grow
Apparentally it make you argue more
The more things you throw
DVD’s and my dirty clothes
Telling me shutup, I’m leaving you
The reason you ain’t even got one
It wasn’t true
Look at her, now look at you
I know we ain’t perfect
But I made our world utopia
How could you not notice?
In denial cause you’re used to losing
Put me through it, ain’t the answer to it
Put on my Vans, take a walk to cool it
But you was always a test and I’m a student
Trying my best
But I never get the right solutions
I swear it’s one thing after another one
Fuck it I’m done
Am I done?
Mother say I’m too young
But what that mean?
I took a chance and now I’m playing
The game of love
Now it’s never ending
Forever chasing
That first feeling
On a quest for a woman's treasure
They keep it hidden
I gotta find love even if it kill me. (I gotta find love even if it kill me)
Can run into it anyday
But knowing me I prolly never meet
Only speak when a fan speak
Never chatting with a stranger
But there’s something about this girl that got me thinkin’. (Damn)
I-Phone accidentally called her
Says hello?
Silent moment
Man, I been missing you
And I know you miss me too
She sighed then she said
Thought we’d be together ’till the end
And this the end
So good luck with your career
Cause we can no longer be friends
Anymore. (Damn)
