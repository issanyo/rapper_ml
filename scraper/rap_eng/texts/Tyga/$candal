[Chorus: Tyga]
Yeah
They tryna put another scandal on me
They tryna get a better handle on me
They hate the way a nigga swaggin' on 'em
All this Cartier and Chanel I'm rockin'
All this Libertine you see me in
I put you on swag and you poppin'
I put you on swag and you poppin'
Look how them cameras is watchin'
They tryna put another scandal on me
They tryna get a better handle on me
They hate the way a nigga swaggin' on 'em
All this Cartier and Chanel I'm rockin'
You gon' hold me down and leave in them CÃ©line sandals I bought you?
You gon' hold me down and leave with the rings on your hands I got you?

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Tryna put another scandal on me
Tryna make an example of me
It's time to make an example of me
I'm droppin' 4 when the Phantom [?]
Gotta take care of the family
And my family's family
Me and my man's is family
That means it's [?]
They tryna put another scandal on me
Yeah, in the tabloids with the flannel on me
They hate the way these diamonds dancin' on me
I'm the reincarnated Michael Jackson
Now they tryna put a scandal on me
Say she young, she was askin' for it
She was askin' for it, I had the answers for her
All I wanna do is tell my story
They tryna put another scandal on me
Fuck the game dawg, it's scandalous
Fuck the game dawg, I swear it's shady
I'm at the beach underneath the cabana
They tryna put another scandal on me
I'm married to the money, that's matrimony

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Tryna put another scandal on me
Judge wanna drop the gavel on me
I know these niggas wanna ransom note me
These days I keep [?] on me
They tryna put another scandal on me
Wanna see me scramble like Randall, homie
Cunningham only thing runnin' his numbers, fam
Still gettin' cash flowin'
They tryna put another scandal on me
More money, more courtrooms
Goin' on my fourth lawsuit
Just bought my fourth Lanvin suit
They tryna put another scandal on me
Fuck the game dawg, it's scandalous
I love my fans, but the game is shady
I do it for y'all, try to understand it
They tryna put another scandal on me
Some of these rappers corny
Some of these rappers real
When I know they feel me, that's mandatory
They tryna put another scandal on me
I'm married to the money, that's matrimony
The chemistry is natural, homie

[Chorus]
