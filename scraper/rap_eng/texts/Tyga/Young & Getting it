OK I go to sleep in the mornin’, been countin’ money all night
I did it all on my own so these cars I’m gon’ buy
Them niggas hated on me, I was all the way in Dubai
Gettin’ lambo doors sky high, told that bitch, bitches know Ty

Red rum, murder gang, these niggas gay like Novacane
My niggas gutta like bowling lanes, like Pedro they go for me
Two Asian bitches, they siamese, so high a nigga look Chinese
She bite the head like Ozzy, Freddy Krueger money you only see in your dreams

H-Town, ball hard like my name Hakeem
Olajuwon, James Harden, y’all niggas new to the scene
And that’s my nigga, Super Club need a new liver
Pop-pop bottles on all these bitches, bitch ass niggas can’t even get in

Relentless, please believe me, that Justin Bieber, my nigga really
Ain’t gotta lie, these niggas feel me, my bars up, like poppin’ wheelies
They want beef cause my neck chilly, got a bad white bitch like Iggy
Iggy pop, rock star livin’, I’m a flyer nigga, shout out to Philly

King shit, yo’ bitch, she all up on all my dick
I get crazy pussy, psychiatrist, all about my paper like journalist
Kill a flow, I earn this shit, we ball for real like tournaments
On the jet, no turbulence, straight flexin’, I’m so bent

No lie, no lie, said I ain’t never told no lie
Said fuck you if you hate me, my real fans gon’ ride
Got my own shoe, clothing line, own label, who tryna sign?
Niggas tryna turn up, but don’t overdose like Len Bias

Hypocrites are all biased, I’ll provide you a Jahova jireh
I could bless you, no church attire, pray to God, I’ll die tryin’
What’s a stone to a big Giant? What’s fire if you can’t ignite it?
I’m fed up like FBI’s, y’all niggas late, cut the peoples time, nigga…
