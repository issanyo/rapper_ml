[Hook: Stefano Moses]

The city’s gone with electricity
No lights so I can hardly see
And all the smiles, screaming rescue me, rescue me
Who to trust, who can you believe?
The devil owns this reality
And all the smiles, screaming rescue me, rescue me
Storm

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Hate lies, never truth when it’s televised
Devils on the screen, fire in their eyes
Put your face to a spell make your soul fly
Pray everyday, so I’m close to God
Looking at the murder rate never ask why
Colt 45, with a 4 5, the innocent die young can’t judge life
Never did so I live fast every night
Wonder why they breathe hate through their wind pipe
Motherfuckers wanna take instead of give advice
Niggas left me now I’m living right
Trying to cheat death with a trick dice
Gambling can’t rely on management
If it’s ’bout business I’ma handle it
I see it all like an analyst
Views of the water, big bills like a Pelican
I’m into different broads, fucking in foreign cars
Wizard of OZ, teal colored Benz, I ain’t got a heart
No love shoot the cupid with a dart, danger in the park
Motherfucker don’t walk past dark
What the fuck is Illuminati
Old niggas with money
Bitch get the power light, stand tall tower light
Gotta fight, can’t let ‘em take our life

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Take a step as the world spin
Rumors come and go faster than a whirlwind
Whirlpool, bitches all getting sucked in
Booty model shake your ass but you’re broke bitch
Man you niggas ain't balling in the bull pen
Riding on the black mag, I’m a cool kid
Last king living, give me space like a movement
Cream get the money, whip icy like cool whip
Oh shit, who shit nigga art gallery flow painted on a globe
Use the colored dope nigga I’m a lobe
Levitator pro, crisis when he spoke, kicking in your door
Hit the flow like Leeroy with a globe
Trying to win but the finish line's far, race against the odds
Race don’t matter when you're dead or start praying to the gods
Don’t let me die so young

[Hook]

[Outro: Stefano Moses]
You're too brave, who will paint that creed on our faces
Like the stars you are far with your back to the others
Storm, storm
