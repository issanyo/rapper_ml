[Hook]
I've been grinding since a day old
Now I'm older but my mama don't think so
My heart big but it beats slow
Can't trust everybody that you meet yo
I dreamt this my whole life
For you to take it, I don't think so
And see that you ain't right
Tryna take my right, I don't think so
I don't think so

[Verse 1]
Some say I'm so arrogant
Talking about every girl and the old ones I hit
Look, miss, whoever told you this ain't him
Dismiss, no time for you small-mind midgets
No offence to them, but giant is what I'm looking like
From short distance, prolific
Write or touch the paper airless nigga
You hearing this, nigga
Inattentive in attendance, listen
Checklist before the guest list
More trying to enter, but won't exist
Cause I'm what next is
Every grand kid expect this
Tyga for they breakfast
Now they want seconds
Damn, wait a second
Let me program
She obsessed with my stylish ass
I just sit back and I laugh
All these clowns tryna pay with my cash
Something they never had for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So what's up, is you down with us?
Of course I'm just on my "what if"
Other shit I'd be getting without this
I don't need all these people
So I look with my ego would envy below
Can't see you, even if I try to
Those right beside you could be your misguidance
For now I say goodbye, boo
Maybe later down the line, we could be cool
Vibe like the magazine, do a movie or two
Review my latest news, interviews, Youtube
Like I got how many views?
You're so just like me
Between worlds, it's a lightning
How you become perfect timing
From far North to the islands
G.E.D they talking
But watch 'em, misery loves company
It's gettin' crowded

[Hook]
