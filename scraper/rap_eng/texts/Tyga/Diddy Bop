In my
In my
In my

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
Boss boss
Through the city block
[x2]

GED
Young Money

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
Boss boss
Through the city block

One verse
One hearse
Tyga, nigga

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
Boss boss
Through the city block

Shit
I approach it with my nose lit
No scent
Since I'm guaranteed in the lead I'm in

Ball bottle buying
Papi sick no medicine

Spin the elegant swank
Walk like elephants

Smooth the scene
Canvas color is green
I don't move unless the car clean
Call me
Dial money in between
The boss like Bosley
You won't see but you heard it's me
I'm one of the henches hurdling

Murderer
I murder them
This trophy my evidence
It's evident
Evidently nigga's bitches full of estrogen
In the corridor
Never bored
Get busy bitch
Seven doors had that white whore on some corny shit

Me
I support chicks
Pour em in that spore shit
Tell em get that mortgage
Morgan bring more in
Forced into foursomes
Now she a top bitch

Cashed in
I be on my diddy shit, bitch

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
Boss boss
Through the city block

I told y'all
One verse one hearse nigga

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
Boss boss
Through the city block

Want more?
Well I'm a serial

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
Boss boss
Through the city block

Do em all

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
Boss boss
Through the city block
