[Intro: Chris Richardson]
Walk a thousand miles
Just to see her (see her)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Sittin’ on a plane
Reminscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back I’d make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Don’t wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
I’m sorry for the games that I played
But now it’s too late
And now she’s…

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 2: Tyga]
It’s cold putting up a fight
Arguing back and forth through the night
Regardless what I said I don’t mean most of it
You know I really love you, this the realest goin’ get
It take time to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I should’ve gave more
Now you’re miles away and I’m miles on tour
Now it’s drums playing, crowd singing
Life changing, wish you was here to witness all
Now that starts fading
They say two wrongs don’t make it right
And I was wrong and now it ain't right

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Bridge: Tyga + Chris Richardson]
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
If I could make it right
I’d do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you I’d spend my life
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
I’d do just that
If I could turn back
(Come back here again)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Bridge: Tyga (Chris Richardson)]
Na na na nah
(Far, far away)
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
If I could make it right
I’d do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you I’d spend my life
Na na na nah
(Far, far away)
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
I’d do just that
(Far away, far away)
If I could turn back
