Verse 1
Ain't no better feeling than the thought of me and
You just layed up in my room everything going to smooth
And can't nobody do you like I do you like I do
Could it be your tattoos that got me in the mood
Baby im ready if you ready just let me know
Best believe ain't no rush, but your tattoos just turn me
On keep it low on the hush everybody ain't got to know
That when im with you, you

Chorus
Ain't no better feeling than the feeling when im kissing on your tattoos
I know how to turn you on never go wrong just kiss on your tattoos
(im kissing on your tattoo)
And I'mma make you stay forever and a day
And you won't want to leave I promise you gon' want to stay
Cause ain't no better feeling than the feeling when im kissing on your tattoo
(on your tattoo)

Verse 2
Ain't nobody killing your tattoos like how you do
And ain't nobody rocking your body like how I do
You got me feeling all crazy when im with you
Or could I just be trippin out on you
Baby im ready if you ready just let me know
You got me feeling a certain way and now were close
Can I have you for the rest of the night just dont say no
Cause when im with you, you
