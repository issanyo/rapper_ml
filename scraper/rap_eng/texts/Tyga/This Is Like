[Intro: Robin Thicke]
All white linen
Riding till the sun comes down
See that we living like woah-oh-oh

[Hook x2: Robin Thicke]
This is like riding through the city
With the ocean in the background
This is like flying in Paris
What your girl say now
Party down

[Verse 1: Tyga]
B-side baby, parler
Waterfront top back, coupe with a fade
Tonight is ours, paper city, red ruby
You looking fine, as beautiful as one could ever be
Tires spinning, fast cars, fast women
And I just wanna get a night with a happy ending
The yacht life, hear the splash, so much class
Lift your glass, make a toast, we around the map
His and hers, Hermès bags, leather tag
All real love, she ain't fucking with a scrub
Chillin on top, get away, just a flight
Living life, this is what it's like..

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
She's so relentless, body of a goddess
Gotta take her higher
Rain through my window pane, she the fire to my flame
Good aim, put your heart where the sky is
It's cold down there but it's lonely up here
The world's so cold you gon' need a moncler
Don't mind stare, when I look at you it's all clear
Tryna keep it together and ball like Ross Dean
4-Seas, car clean, Harleys
I'm from the gold-era, my jewels is Gili
A party ain't a party if it ain't all night
Living life, this is what it’s like

[Hook x2: Robin Thicke]

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Like dolphin like you’ve never seen before
Yea this is like a penthouse, served at the top floor
This is like love, that you can never get
And nobody can, woah-oh-oh
This is like woah…
This is like woah…
This is like woah…
This is like…

[Verse 3: Tyga]
All John Blaze, collar shirts, school days
On stage, a hundred thou, two days
Looking down on top from where the stars stay
Reservoir and back guards in the entry way
I’m young and wild and I charm our old mother
Invited your young daughter, I’m known across waters
Horses in the stable, Ferrari ‘cause I’m able
Whole life I’ve been waiting

[Hook x2: Robin Thicke]

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
This is like riding…
This is like flying…
This is like love…
