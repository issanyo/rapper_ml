[Intro: Tyga]
Pussy Talkin' like
Pussy Talkin' like

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ay Babe, why you puttin us on display?
Bringing up old shit in front of all her friends
And trying to start today with arguments
Trying to relax like Parliaments, you doin the opposite
Texting Kesha like,"Man, I think this nigga be cheating"
I'm late working, I know I didn't come home that evening
Calling my phone, attitudes, heavy breathing
I mean whats the reason? Or was that your menstrual speaking?
I ain't gamin', just tired of fakin' no patience be a Rider like Isaiah
Thomas, Clay Aiken no gay shit, ass naked
Commando baby, she got my dick motivated

[Hook: Tyga]
We waking up in the middle of the night
Fuck and make up right after we fight
Pussy Talkin' like (We-We-Well Done)
Pussy Talkin' like (We-We-Well Done)
Man she always waking up in the middle of the night
Fuck and make up right after we fight
Pussy Talkin' like (We-We-Well Done)
Pussy Talkin' like (We-We-Well Done)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, lay it down, bend it over like strippers open
Water gun dick shoot you now you super soakin'
Coming down your chimney, call it Santa working
I brought some gifts for you, mango flavored lotion
Wetter than a loofa (loofa) on your momma sofa
Stretch it out, Rosa Acosta
I do this shit, have you cumming over and over
Again, like a maid service clean her perfect
I ain't perfect, most of them bitches don't deserve me
I had my moments, but most of them bitches all be thirsty
They ain't worth it
Block them all, like stage curtains
Knock em' off, like fake purses
I ain't tricking but you got it
Loving you being honest
Hard to be honest when most of the time your indecisive
I'm tired of fighting
Let it go, close your eyelids
Open the morning fresh, and we vibing

[Hook: Tyga]
