[Intro: Sample]

[Chorus]
I been unfaithful, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle
But I ain't lyin' when I say I love you
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle
Ah, yeah, I been wildin', yeah, I been wildin'
I been unfaithful, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle
But I ain't lyin' when I say I love you
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle
Ah, yeah, I been wildin', yeah, I been wildin'

[Verse 1]
I been unfaithful, you were an angel
I ran off with your halo, yeah, I made you unstable
Did you get what you came for? Yeah, I got what I came for
You love that designer but being my girl was your favorite label, yeah
I been caught and now the case closed, don't know
Yeah, I been caught and now the case closed, don't know
I'ma tell it all, Jose Canseco, oh, no
You want me to say that it ain't so, but I can't say it ain't, so you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I been unfaithful
Just when 'I love you' turns into 'I hate you'
Baby, baby, let me explain to you
I don't know what to say, oh, no, no
Yeah, I been unfaithful
Just when 'I love you' turns into 'I hate you'
Baby, baby, let me explain to you
So oh no, oh no

[Chorus]
I been unfaithful, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
But I ain't lyin' when I say I love you (there's something to say to you)
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
Ah, yeah, I been wildin', yeah, I been wildin' (there's something to say to you)
I been unfaithful, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
But I ain't lyin' when I say I love you (there's something to say to you)
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
Ah, yeah, I been wildin', yeah, I been wildin' (there's something to say to you)

[Verse 2]
Now don't you act innocent 'cause you went nights without hittin' me
But it's not just me
I sabotage, I ruin things before it ruins me
Yeah, silly you, yeah, stupid me 'cause losin' you could ruin me
Still, I been unfaithful, makin' mistakes I can't pay for
Keisha, Lisa and Rachel, we lay up and lay low
I was up and the race slow, you was tellin' me race home
I was whippin' the Wraith slow 'cause I already know I gotta tell you

[Chorus]
I been unfaithful, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
But I ain't lyin' when I say I love you (there's something to say to you)
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
Ah, yeah, I been wildin', yeah, I been wildin' (there's something to say to you)
I been unfaithful, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
But I ain't lyin' when I say I love you (there's something to say to you)
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lyin' like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
Ah, yeah, I been wildin', yeah, I been wildin' (there's something to say to you)
