(verse)
Who the hottest niggas out boy?, YOUNG MONEY
We can buy you niggas out if really wanted
Car transformin', the grill George Forman
Whwhat I paid for it? your house plus mortgagegage
Raps borin', and you niggas ain't even tourin'
I just bought a fly bitch now that bitch to tourin'
My swagg soarin', sharper then source awards awards is
Award me, best horror, tyga monster
Willy wonka, welcome to my chocolate fuckers
Cherry pop em', like bubble rap in the boxes
That girl bopper, be tweetin' all the homies watch her
Binoculars the only way you gon' see me partner
My life is awesome, im on so you know she off one
Im in my zone home girl stop cock blocking
Bitch, roosters on my watch, rubies tick tockin'
Young money goblins, we are a fuckn' problem

(HOOK, TYGA)
Bitch im young money
Bitch im young money
Bitch im young money
Bitch, im, young
