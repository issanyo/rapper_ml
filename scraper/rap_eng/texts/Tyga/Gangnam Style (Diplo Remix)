[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Mind right, money right
Enjoy yourself tonight
I lost my phone, and I'm about to lose my voice tonight
I say I, I, I should be your choice tonight
I say I, I, I should be your choice tonight
Mind right, money right
Enjoy yourself tonight
I lost my phone, and I'm about to lose my voice tonight
I say I, I, I should be your choice tonight
I say I, I, I should be your choice tonight

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Gold chain, Magnum style
My homies gang bang, Gangnam Style
My money long like beach towels
They judging me, but I ain't on trial
I'm a Hot Boy, you barely mild
My flow hard like it's around
I take her down 'til she tap out
Sorry I'm gonna call you Mrs. Childs
I speak that Guapanese
We lightin' up that broccoli
I play with money, that's Monopoly
I don't believe in monogamy
Motherfuckin' star, I'mma need my spacers
Made a half a million today, ain't got no time for no fuckin' haters

[Hook: Psy]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
You sexy and you know it
Clap your hands, drink some Moet
Ballin so hard, but we don't need no refs
I took the elevator and used no steps
You think you sexy baby, put your hands high
I'm the bomb baby, landmine
And I like shoppin' in my spare time
You sexy and you know it
Clap your hands, drink some Moet
You sexy and you know it
Clap your hands, drink some Moet

[Outro: Psy]
Eh, sexy lady
Op, op, op, op
Oppa Gangnam Style
Gangnam Style
