[Tyga:] Introducing Amber Melody

[Amber Melody:]
I was rolling out today
And the day seemed hazed
From the tobacco and the zig zag
That I made

And I'm really trying to wake myself
So many things I had to do before you came today
I can't blame no one else
It's not your fault but

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro

People tell me I'm a fool
Because I'm loving you
But they don't know the way you make me feel inside

Today I should've passed you on
But I crave too strong
And even though it's wrong at least I said I tried

Oh I remember
Hydro, My dro
Forgot the words to say
But I don't care now

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro

Wrap it, light it, take a hit
And I'm feeling kinda high
Maybe chill out that's the shit
And pass it on

Wrap it, light it, take a hit
And I know you wanna try
Lay back, chill out, that's the shit
And pass it on

[Tyga:]
Love love, I know you miss me
The way I do your memory
You always forgetting
Forgive me, without you
I feel so empty
Endless resentment
I need you sitting next to me
Peachy, cream, blueberries in between
I can make your eyes appear Chinese
You know what I mean
Whatever the case seem to be
You can always depend on marijuana
Pick out become farmers
Let the earth grow upon us
We'll make millions, become stars
The world is ours, so let's cherish these two hours
But damn what about tomorrow?
I mean

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro

What else can I do
When I'm home with you
You brighten up my day
Smoke, smoke, smoke dro
