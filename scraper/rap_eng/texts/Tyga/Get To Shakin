[Verse 1 : Pricetag]
I pull up [?] bang
[?]
Baby it's that Louis and your body [?]
Ask around they tell you that I'm on like a power switch
Swag is sick doctor said you need [?]
On cloud now with no plane no parachute
Stacks by the pack [?] for a pair of 2
HD body so I sit back and stare at you
Movin' now, movin' now, lil mama movin' now
Bring the ladies to the front
Tell the haters moving back
She shake so much the DJ started annoucing
What can I say ?
Her body got the bouncers even bouncing
And you know how I do steeze flyin' off the roof
V.I.P with hundred dollar bills flyin' off the roof
So I
[?]
Yo go tell Gotti there's a five star chick here
Yeah


[Hook]
If you fly and you know it put your hands in the air
If you gettin' money and you blow it everywhere
They be hatin' on you girl but you don't even care
So come and put it on me girl, now shake it for a player
Get to shakin' something, get to, get to shakin' something
Get to, get to shakin' something, all the ladies on the dancefloor
Get to shakin' something, get to, get to shakin' something
Get to, get to shakin' something, all the ladies on the dancefloor



[Verse 2 : Oktane]
Okay, yeah
You know who I be
It's Mr. Drop It On her Before She Can Count To 3
And mama two step right next to Price and me
It's miss London and miss Fox and that's when you gon' see
That lil mama [?] hotter than [?]
I see her, I would her, I like her, I need her
Her walk real mean and her [?] way meaner
But I need her to get to shakin' some like
And she gon' do just that cause she knows daddy watchin'
Lil mama go to work like she did her fist
And I call her balloon cause shawty always poppin'
And I'm looking at my watch and she ain't plannin' on stoppin'
And no neither am I cause I am that guy
[?] on everything I land super fly
I told her to drop it and she just ask me why
I say "Listen to the hook and I get back at you in five"
Because
