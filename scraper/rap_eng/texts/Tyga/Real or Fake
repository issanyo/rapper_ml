Money on my table, pick it up, I’ll call it tip the waiter

I'm the dopest nigga , word to Ronald Reagan
She don’t play no games, she blow me like a Sega
Hundred thousand on my tax
Twenty thousand on my tats
No lie, I’ve got twelve hundred snapbacks
Go yard everywhere, bitch I’m ballin
Young money running shit, you niggas just jogging

Hotter then the summer coupe
South beach fountain blue
Cherry pie leather seats roofies on tomato soup
German shepherd in my engine, barking at you scary bitches
Best defense, nigga...!
Had a couple tickets, I was young into wrestling
Choke slam a nigga, big show pick ‘em
I’m on my P's and Q's
I don’t ask questions, I figure shit out

Multiplying decimals
Son o' hecklin in my denim, lick the bullet like a lizard
Couldn't see me with a sigma, definately ill autism
Hard alliance but its Tyga hotter then a fucking iron
Put that bitch on silent cause she talking like she Tyra
Too much, Uh niggas say they baby mommas love me
Crazy, I was on a tour with Diddy counting that Ciroc money
But it’s young money, YM hoes
