[Hook: Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Pull up in a brand new foreign
300 on the dash, and a paycheck cashed
Take off on you niggas, Jeff Gordon
AP, it cost me fifty
Model ho, yeah she with me
Living life like I’m Diddy
In the kitchen with Whitney
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap, trap house jumping like Jordan
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap, trap house jumping like Jordan
AP, it cost me fifty
Model ho, yeah she with me
Living life like I’m Diddy
In the kitchen with Whitney

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Yeah, yeah trap house jumping like Jordan
J's in the hood, they’re snorting
Double cup, lean, I’m pouring
Your bitch whipping in the early morning
Pulled up in the drop top phantom
Niggas in the hood can’t stand it
Whip game is so special
I’m whipping at the whole grand canyon
I got Molly, I got white, Marilyn Mason!
I went to the jeweler, cashed out on a new piece, now my diamonds dancing
Your bitch think I’m romantic
My coke card game is frantic
My whip game make you panic
My plug is Phil Jackson
Feeling like Mutombo, I got all the Kush bo's
Juggin at the Texaco, you smoking on Reginald
Trap game, Elvis Presley, you can’t impress me
Dark skinned ho, cook up the dope, she look like Nestle
Gone!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Auggh!!
Uh, aye bitch, tongue out
Alley oop this bad bitch, Tim Duncan, in her mouth
My nigga came with some white girl
I told that nigga no doubt
If I ain't the rawest out, I'm like Willis what the fuck you talkin' bout
Trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap house jumping like Jordan
At D.O.A with 40 thousand, with 40 bitches bout to blow it
I'm on the jet hungover, Migos meet me when I get sober
All these niggas acting like soldiers, make a phone call and it's over (Bitch!!)
Rich game, LK
Get up off my dick snake
You bitch made, and your bitch a maid
My worst day is my better days
My chain came from the Everglades
My money great, you forever fake
Tatted up like a esse'
My AP worth a house on the lake
Auggh!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house jumping like Kobe
Cashed a hundred K on the rollie
You don't want it with me nigga, don’t talk to me nigga
Ima real ass nigga, you phony!
In the kitchen whipping up them babies
And pirex trap go crazy
Young nigga got money, young nigga got work
Young nigga got crack like the 80s
I’m winning, I’m winning, I’m dunking, I’m dunking
I’m Jordan, you not even Kobe
In the kitchen with the pirex pot
Water whipping and the pot too hot
Drinking lean, out the bottle
In a Aston Martin, foreign with a model
So many racks on me, got tats on me
In the bed with 6 hoes like 2 x 3

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Trap house like Jordan
I’m a free man, no Morgan!
That choppa, it take out you organs
I play with them keys, no organ!
Bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean, I’m pouring, I'm snoring
I’m making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Who the fuck, nigga better have help
You don't trap on the block if you dont live there
The trap be jumping, and bunking
The fiends they running, the money keep coming
I'm kicking hoes out like a punter
If I start shooting, turn to a track runner
I'm calling up rich, he bringing the kids
Whipping the babies all summer

[Hook]
