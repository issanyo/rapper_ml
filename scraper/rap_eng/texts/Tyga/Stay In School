[Intro]
Yeah, Uh
Let's try some shit

[Chorus]
Say I ain't the one?
Stay in school, do your homework
I was on first, yeah, yeah, yeah, what?
Uh, I supply my own work
Stay in school, do your homework
Nigga i'ma teach ya
How to beat the media
See they try to beat me up
Now you see my feet is up, ooh, ooh
Want that true shit, that's true, true
Yeah I got the new, new
So new, it's too new, ooh
Get your boo 'fore you boohoo
Once she make a move in my new ghost with the chauffeur (uh)
Gold with the fur
You ain't heard I'm paid?
Stay in school, do your homework (woo)

[Post-Chorus]
You want to get to know her
I hit and roll over
Tears on my shoulder
Where my city at?
Right here on my shoulder
I told them bitches, what?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, don't hit me up
300 horses in that thing, giddy up, yeah
Yeah I know you wanna be thick as fuck
We can get it done, the titties or the butt?
Fuck it, get them both
You thought I come alone?
Better do your homework
All my niggas toke
Better do your homework
We swore to the oath
All my niggas do they homework
They show up to your home, woah
Hold on, lemme stop it
My momma going shoppin'
Joint account, I gotta watch it
[?] bling, got the whole team watches
Now we throwing rollies in the sky and rogers
Say I ain't poppin'?

[Chorus]
Stay in school, do your homework
I was on first, yeah, yeah, yeah, what?
Uh, I supply my own work
Stay in school, do your homework
Nigga i'ma teach ya
How to beat the media
See they try to beat me up
Now you see my feet is up, ooh, ooh
Want that true shit, that's true, true
Yeah I got the new, new
So new, it's too new, ooh
Get your boo 'fore you boohoo
Once she make a move in my new ghost with the chauffeur (uh)
Gold with the fur
You ain't heard I'm paid?
Stay in school, do your homework (woo)

[Post-Chorus]
You want to get to know her
I hit and roll over
Tears on my shoulder
Where my city at?
Right here on my shoulder
I told them bitches, what?

[Verse 2]
You don't live it up
If there's money on the floor
Bend over, pick it up
Counted so much paper
I done cut my fingers up
Shout out to my es√©, riding on the trunk
15k, 5 days at the Trump
45k on the jet, rolling blunts
Say I ain't the one?
Stay in school, do your homework
Knew you'd act like a hoe first

[Outro]
You knew hating on me won't work
Thugged out, in the club, no shirt
With my chains on
She give me wet head, that's a brainstorm
I like a hot girl with the braids in
And the ass fat, and the waist slim
Sayin' I ain't him, do your homework
