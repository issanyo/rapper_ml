[Verse 1: Tyga]
Yeah, ha ha!
AAH! You was with the boy before and after
So, when I hit the top, I'mma make sure you matter
Have you popping everywhere, my little firecracker
They say sun doesn’t shine without the queen’s laughter
Uh, my love like a field goal
‘Cause I’mma post up with you when the lights gone
Never do you wrong, ‘cause you the right one
Big shining in the Porsche with the ice on
Yeah, in the drop, riding ‘round the city
Don’t play, this a monumental moment, baby
Take a moment, think about your life without me, baby
This can’t be life, so let’s make it right tonight
Yeah, woo!

[Verse 2: Dyllan Murray]
Only took one look, girl
Got this young boy shook, girl
Bad, and you know it
Your body off the hook, girl
Probably thinking I’m a rook, girl
You ain’t even know it

[Pre-Chorus: Dyllan Murray]
Them-them sparks about to fly (yeah, yeah)
The moment that your lips touched mine

[Chorus: Dyllan Murray]
‘Cause you know that you got me, girl, got me, girl, got me, girl
Yeah, it’s on and poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl, poppin’ girl
Oh, girl, you’re like a flame
You blow my mind how your body bangs
Poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl
Baby, you my little firecracker
Bang, bang, bang, bang
‘Cause you my little firecracker
Bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse 3: Dyllan Murray]
Don’t know how it happened
Kinda hard to believe the feelings that I’m catchin’
I ain’t even gassin’
Like a moth to the flame, look at my reaction

[Pre-Chorus: Dyllan Murray]
Them-them sparks about to fly (yeah, uh, uh, yeah)
The moment that your lips touched mine

[Chorus: Dyllan Murray]
‘Cause you know that you got me, girl, got me, girl, got me, girl
Yeah, it’s on and poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl, poppin’ girl
Oh, girl, you’re like a flame
You blow my mind how your body bangs
Poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl
Baby, you my little firecracker
Bang, bang, bang, bang
‘Cause you my little firecracker
Bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse 4: Jack Johnson + Jack Gilinsky]
Bang, bang, bang, b-bang, bang! Ha!
Okay, the second I saw your face, something hit me like, “Bang!”
Dang! What a strange sensation overtaking my brain!
Fast-forward a couple months
And now, me and you are cruising down Hollywood Boulevard with the windows down
And, girl, when you’re around, time moves slowly
And you’re the only-
-one who can make me stress-free when you hold me
I know these-
-girls try to show me what’s good
I don’t pay them any mind at all
Three shots, let’s go!
Just give me the night with you
Baby, nothing more
And, if one thing’s true, it’s that…

[Pre-Chorus: Dyllan Murray]
Them sparks about to fly
The moment that your lips touched mine

[Chorus: Dyllan Murray]
‘Cause you know that you got me, girl, got me, girl, got me, girl
Yeah, it’s on and poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl, poppin’ girl
Oh, girl, you’re like a flame
You blow my mind how your body bangs
Poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl, poppin’, girl
Baby, you my little firecracker
Bang, bang, bang, bang
‘Cause you my little firecracker
Bang, bang, bang, bang
