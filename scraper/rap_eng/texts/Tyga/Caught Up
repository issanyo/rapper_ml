[Chorus: Bryan J]
But I was caught up, in physical attraction
Caught up in physical attraction
Caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Caught up in physical attraction
She got me
Caught up in physical attraction
She got me
Caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction

[Verse 1: Bryan J]
She drop it low, her friends can't
I'm tryna take her somewhere but her friends ain't
She bend it over, got a Instagram
Got a pretty Twitter name
It's all up in my face down

I met her Friday, called her on a Saturday
We had drinks now the girl up in my place
Ain't beating around no bushes
I'm on that good shit
You're seeing now how goodie goodie, good is
We bumpin, we grinding
But that's all in my mind then
Cause we're still in the club
I can't even stop but I'm

[Chorus: Bryan J]
Caught up in physical attraction
Caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Caught up in physical attraction
She got me
Caught up in physical attraction
She got me
Caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I get away, never caught up
I'm here to stay, like a pick up game
I ball up, I'm the shit, need a toilet
She my bitch, she spoiled
In the moment, enjoy it
Cause I'm a dog like ahoya
Whip game proper, I ain't talking my driving
Take a shot for your fine ass, I know you got high tollerance
Hallelujah we hommin, swervin' on that i10
Ain't trippin' 'bout you little boyfriend
Just remember don't get get

[Chorus: Bryan J & (Tyga)]
Caught up in physical attraction (Don't get get)
Caught up in physical attraction (Don't get get)
Caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction (Don't get get)
She got me
Caught up in physical attraction (Don't get get)
She got me
Caught up in physical attraction (Don't get get)
But to my satisfaction

She droppin low, she lookin back
Her picture's got me thirsty like I'm runnin laps
Man I told her, that I love her
But she won't [?] to me, and it's killing me
She talking good shit am I right then
I'm talking I leave and I'll be right here
I'm patient like she my nurse and it's
The sky falls to the night girl
No time for reversing this

We bumpin, we grinding
But that's all in my mind then
Cause we're still in the club
I thought it was love but I was

[Chorus]
Caught up in physical attraction
Caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Caught up in physical attraction
She got me
Caught up in physical attraction
She got me
Caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
