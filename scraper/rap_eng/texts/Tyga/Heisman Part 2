[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ahh!
Bitch, it's T-Raw, blood on my paws
Big booty chick back a nigga to the wall
Never get involved, murder every bar
Shit so illegal, need a green card
Different cars, different from y'all
I work hard, you work at the mall
Pass a bitch off like my nigga John Wall
Fuck her in the dark, gimme the light, Sean Paul
(Yeahhh), bitch I do this shit
Cooler than a motherfucking penguin limp
& my bitch pussy fire gotta extinguish it, Lebron James & shit
Got heat super freak Rick James ya bitch, leave a stain & shit
On ya couch in ya house like Brother Man
Hanging like Mr. Cooper Hahn

[Chorus: Tyga]
Posing, Heisman
Posing, Heisman
Posing, Heisman

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Yo, got a Asian bitch on my left side
Another Asian bitch, right, right side
They might send your ass off to the next side
Bitch hold your damn breath cause you might die
Gotta group of bad bitches and I feel good
Oh your hungry? Too bad cause my meals good
And I shouldn't beat a broad, yet I still would
But I won't try and be bad, cause the deal's good
Yeah, now look I got that urge to feed them off some gold and shit
[Type of stuff] and make them feel like alcohol and [gold] and shit
Hold the bitch, just sold the bitch, 'fuck you pay me' is what I told the bitch
You can't walk or talk, I own you bitch
Please don't make me hot, I'm the coldest bitch (agh)

[Chorus: Tyga]
Posing, Heisman

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Well, running from the cop, boy born to kill
Hand me the lock, bring it to your front door, doorbell
Knock knock, who there? Houdini dissappear
Got green, John Deere. More green, Paul Pierce
(agh) Amazing with the shot, you my son, I adopt dot dot
Pac-Man, that's for opening your mouth
Bust a nut, kick her out, lit a cigarrette now
Put the cigarette down, I'm the shit, loose bowels
Wow, Laughing, did I say that out loud?
Nigga getting busy like I work downtown
On to the next if she don't fuck right now (right now)
Harder than a pipe, can't pipe down
What you niggas talking about?
Man I'm what your bitch is talking about
Two months then the album out
Careless World drop, pewm, then I'm out

[Chorus: Tyga]
Posing, Heisman

[Verse 4: Honey Cocaine]
If a bitch fuck around, I'mma go off
My advice is she better get on the go
You came to shop at the mall but I bought the stores
I got a box of jewels, I call it pot of gold
Got the cop to go, as my pockets grow
Check the chains and the rings and the watches bro
And I boxed a slut, I just boxed a ho
You tryna pass me bitch? It ain't possible, nah
I'm cool as fuck, I suggest you dress for the weather bitch
It's whatever shit, whenever bitch
What a whore to a queen? Whatever bitch
I crop a kid, it's a hot to shit
Some Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada Shit
Tell them eat a dick, you ain't nada bitch
Find me at the club where my partners is
(Swag, Be-Betch)

[Chorus: Tyga]
Posing, Heisman

(Bitch I'm the shit)
