[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Boom, boom, we balling in the room
Sweeping up my competition, call me Mr. Broom
Knocking niggas over, call me bulldozer
One more drink for these bitches and it's over
'Cause I'ma strike that something like a cobra
I know she want my venom, but I ain't gon' leave it in her
And right after I get her, she know she with a winner
And we straight to the crib, I ain't taking her to dinner
Nigga look at my jewels
Aviator shades I ain’t looking at you
*Achoo*, bless me twice
Ill rich nigga, I be shitting on your life
Magazine covers, magneem rubbers
I mean magnum, I don’t fuck with stragglers
Niggas want drama, Gangsta Grillz bastards
Did you check the caption, lights camera, action

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby
Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby
Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby
Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby

Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby
Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby
Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby
Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
A nigga beep beep and shawty toot, toot
Blowing out there brains, car need a new roof
Looking like a superstar, when I roll through
And shawty I'm the truth, so mama what it do?
Now let’s ride out, ain’t no tripping
When we dipping to my hide-out
Big dipper 'cause you sipping on my bottle
Only fucking with them A-listing models
Now let’s get it like
Low fitted if you done it then I did it
If you kick it, then I'm with it
We can do this shit all-night
Your minute don’t compare to my limit
When I'm in it
And I get it

Don’t stand in lines nigga I bogart
Bad boy celebrity 'cause I'm so large
And don’t need no battery 'cause I'm in charge

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Holla at me, boo, holla at me, baby

Don't say shit, get your face-lift

Niggas swag jack but this L.A. shit
Get it back, give it back ain't ’bout shit
Snapback them ain't even rare, where the tag at
Wackass all up in my ear bitch back back

Got the phantom out, no mask
Get your camera out uh, one flash
Hot beams steady shot clap your ass

Patron top wash straight from the liquor store
