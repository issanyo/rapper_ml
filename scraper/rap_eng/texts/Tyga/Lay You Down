[Intro: Lil Wayne, Tyga & D.A. Wallach]
Hello world, my name is not important
Today is about (Tyga) yessir!
Lay you, lay you, down
Yeah, let's go
I'mma sit back and smoke (hohh)
I might grab my guitar

[Hook: D.A. Wallach]
I got these bullets in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down
Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down

[Verse 1: Tyga & D.A. Wallach]
Uh, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Only soft shit I'm into, nigga is pussy
Hard head, from a city where really you blue or all red
Like when it pop off (pop pop) better play dead
Lay you, lay you, down
Hah, same day, catch me on some different shit
Hah, front yard, posted on some prison shit
Uh, even as a kid, fight until you win
Life is kill or be killed, yeah

[Hook: D.A. Wallace & Lil Wayne]
I got these bullets in my cham-ber (yeah)
Don't make me let off a round (so like I said)
If my life's in dan-ger (or better yet like he said)
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down
Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down (get 'em boy)

[Verse 2: Tyga & D.A. Wallach]
Uh, I like to floss so mama told me be cautious
She know the cost, she told me death ain't a option
Too many lives lost, shootout on the boulevard
Guns drawn, pick a card, lucky me, I wasn't home
Lay you, lay you, down
Damn, I hope it, wasn't one of my homies dawg
His family called, I ain't even hear my phone
Now I'm looking for revenge, swerving on this road
If I should die and never wake, pray the Lord take my soul
But you already know

[Hook: D.A. Wallace & Lil Wayne]
I got these bullets in my cham-ber (yeah)
Don't make me let off a round (so like I said)
If my life's in dan-ger (or better yet like he said)
I'm gonna lay you down
Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger (ya heard?)
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down
Better make me love you, baby!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & D.A. Wallach]
Ahem, reporting live from the barrel (get 'em!)
Two tear drops under that eye on the sparrow (ughh!)
I'm from a small place they call Uptown
Where we (lay you) where we (lay you) hahahah (down)
Like concrete in the driveway, shoot sideways
Like O-Dog on "Menace", leave you brains in yo' tennis
I'm the Renaissance Man, so put me in the book
And I got my pistol on the hook, sing, hahahah

[Hook: D.A. Wallace]
I got these bullets in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down
Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down

[Outro: Lil Wayne & D.A. Wallach]
When I say "fuck y'all"
I really mean mammy motherfuck all y'all
Tyga Tyga (lay you) Young Money (lay you)
I thought you knew (down)
Lay you, lay you, down
