[VERSE: AcEtheGenius]
You told me to be honest so IMA tell you the truth, if forever does exist then IMa spend it with you
You dating other guys while time flys and clouds roll by. AND storms hit and lightning was lit
[Hook]
Killing all your
Ills when you know you should slow it down
Killing all your ills when you know you could slow it down

[Verse 2: Esty]

Seems like it was only just a day ago
Since I last saw my baby go
Thought your decision was irrational
Why the thought of you with someone else
Doing all the the things we used to do
Are you thinking of me now

But you know that I fall for it
Every fucking time
Tell me what's become of this

[Hook]

Killing all your ills when you know you could slow it down, when you know you could slow it down (3x)

[Verse 2: Esty]

Take, take all that you want from me
No I don't really mind
Go that extra mile yeah
Think about you all the time
I know that's its hard to admit
You were wrong but you can't
Live your life this way, live your life this way

But you know that I fall for it
Every fucking time
Tell me what's become of this

[Hook]

Killing all your ills when you know you could slow it down, when you know you could slow it down (3x)

[Verse 4:Tyga]

Sugar flow
Cocaine levels below
Inherit my love
Pour it on your heart and make a toast
Celebrate to new life no arc light but it's a movie though
But the bad guy doesn't die at the end of this movie no
Who knew she knew
But I knew she knew
That I'd overdose to something more than me and her could ever grow
Sweeter than a mimosa
Valet the rollses
Used to cut the mag had a room full of posters
Damn, what don't kill you make you stronger what my mama says
Too much of anything will kill you that's honesty
Shit
But I'm back to the lab lil vodka in my glass
These white girls love me like a nigga shaft
Never back down never back down never back down let me back out
Raw like Eddy, the golden child
To the day that I'm crossed out and foul out
Be a player
Need a SB
Esty you can kill it now

[Hook]
