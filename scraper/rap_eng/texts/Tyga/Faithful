[Intro: Tyga]
Oh, you leavin' me, I'm leavin' me
I make you rock

[Chorus: Tyga]
Have faith in me, have faith in me
Have a lil faith in me, oh, have faith in me
When your road gets dark and you can no longer see
Let your boy throw a spark and have a lil faith in me
To get you a sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation
Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but have a lil faith
Sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation
Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but baby, baby

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Have faith in me, just wait for me
Put all your weight on me, everything on me
Lean on me like the drink on me
And have faith in me, faith in me, yeah
You were blind and I made you see, yeah
Give me time, give me peace of mind
Love me faithfully, baby, baby, have faith
That face is first place, yeah, can't be replaced, yeah
I race to your side, I try and fail but never fail to try
(1) and try again, (2), and try again
I might have been outta my mind (true)
To my defense, pressure makes diamonds
And you see how I shine

[Chorus: Tyga]
So have faith in me, have faith in me
Have a lil faith in me, oh, have faith in me
When your road gets dark and you can no longer see
Let your boy throw a spark and have a lil faith in me
To get you a sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation
Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but have a lil faith
Sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation
Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but baby, baby

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Have some faith in me, baby, know the stakes have been crazy
All this time has been passin', and now I'm talkin' action
Seatbelt fastened, got me in the speedway dashin'
Clean but I love it when she get nasty
She just passed me, keep a bad one with it
Just so she can make the threesome nasty
That's flashy and I'm classy
But real enough to fuck you in the backseat
Put you in the pad like you in a maxi
And have you runnin' to me like you in a track meet
You attract me but keep it on track
'Cause the fact is, I want you to have faith in me
It's gon' work, believe me

[Chorus: Tyga]
So have faith in me, have faith in me
Have a lil faith in me, oh, have faith in me
When your road gets dark and you can no longer see
Let your boy throw a spark and have a lil faith in me
To get you a sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation
Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but have a lil faith
Sensation, communication, penetration, stimulation
Ventilation, innovation, you get impatient but baby, baby
Have a lil faith in me
