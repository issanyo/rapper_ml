You know she just moved out of Momma’s
Just went back to college
She is my dancer, when she dance I throw her dollars
I throw her dollars, I-I-I throw her dollars
She is my dancer, when she dance I throw her dollars
She works hard for the money (So, so hard)
So hard for the money (So, so hard)
She be dancin’ for them dollars (Yeah)
She be dancin’ for them dollars (Yeah)
She be dancin’ for them dollars (Yeah)
Dancin’ for them dollars

Uh, same nigga that you knew since back when
You ain't had too many dollars, and you couldn’t trust your friends, used to ride around Impala
Drop you off right after high school
I don’t know too many like you, bitches hate but they won’t fight you
Uh, as far as nothing, too honest…
No time for no problems, it’s all good cause you bad
You just be fallin’ for the wrong niggas
I’m clicking all of her pictures, and she showing all of that ass
’Bout that life, you don’t even gotta act
You ain't gotta know how to know that

[Hook]

Money slaves, can’t save them
Her mind gone, she tainted
She getting double what she made then
Ain’t gotta man, but she paid man
She know the game, it ain’t fair
Just foul play, no referees
I’m falling back, just watching that
In the corner off with a couple of racks
I like that, I need that, I want that, I see that
Can I meet that, where you be at, everybody try to beat that
I’m clicking all of her pictures, and she showing all of that ass
Got that life, you don’t even gotta act
You ain't gotta know how to know that

[Hook]

I like that, I need that, I want that, I see that
Can I meet that, where you be at, everybody try to beat that
I- I like that, I need that, I want that, I see that
Can I meet that, where you be at, everybody try to beat that
I-I-I Like that…
I-I-I Need that…
I-I-I Like that…
Can I, Can I, Can I meet that…
