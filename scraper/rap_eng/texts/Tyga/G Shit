[Intro: Tyga]
Haha, you know
A lot of girls say a lot of things to me
Saying they this and that, but I ain't listening
'Cause I'm on some G shit
Young Money

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh I'm in this bitch 'til my eyes white
They say I'm all hype, miss me if you blink twice
If your hair pussy right, I'ma fuck you all night
The rockstar young Beatle tell 'em good night
Kiss dada, momma love 'em about my dolla
Space comma bills up in Benihana
Ice water cash make my dick larger
I sex harder, make you sweat sauna
Haha, dope nigga fuck dope bitches
From the city were lonesome and dose dickies
B side with the Barbie that's 250
Let her kiss on my neck but no hickies (no hickies)
Driveway like Sin City
Make a movie with the star, let the lights hit ya
Haha she think I ain't gon' get
But I'm a fly nigga I ain't tripping, shawty so

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It really don't matter to me
I'm loving all these girls 'cause all these girls love me
Under the sheets
'B'out to party with ya body, I'm a freak
Money ain't a thang thang and I'ma do my thang thang
I'm on some G shit, baby, on some G shit, baby

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Haha, yeah, look
Louboutin Red Bottoms 'cause she that nice
Her body stack right, miss her if you blink twice
And never compare her to the rest 'cause she so far
She got security with her I call her lonestar
YSL fly as hell with them French tips
Let's hit the water set sail give me French kisses
People flashing everywhere that we go
Ice cold nigga but the chain still rocky road
Ice cream, I'm fucking with them ice queens
Long hair pretty yellow bone lightning
'Cause she's exciting, I take her clothes off
I kiss it three times and then I doze off, haha
'Cause I'm the best whoever did it
And she's the best 'cause she with me
She think I ain't gon' hit it
But I’m a fly nigga I ain't tripping, shawty so

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It really don't matter to me
I'm loving all these girls 'cause all these girls love me
Under the sheets
'B'out to party with ya body, I'm a freak
Money ain't a thang thang and I'ma do my thang thang
I'm on some G shit, baby, on some G shit, baby

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Fresh planes drive her to my jetway
First class yeah that's where my chef stay
I'm ahead of you niggas, I skip one grade
On islands and yachts with my Louis shades
Uh, yeah, but like Gucci Mane baby have some lemonade
Umbrella, drink dessert, soufflé
Patron shot straight turn a nigga two-face
Hot drunk girls say they love my baby face
Uh but I'ma still keep it G though (yeah)
Captain of my ship and I ain't never wearing speedos (no)
My herringbone on, she let me bone on
Poke her now chauffeur take her home
Put it on my camera phone, I know I'm wrong
But I'm in too deep, uh, Nia Long
She fall in love with every love song
She wanna be in love, uh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It really don't matter to me
I'm loving all these girls 'cause all these girls love me
Under the sheets
'B'out to party with ya body, I'm a freak
Money ain't a thang thang and I'ma do my thang thang
I'm on some G shit, baby, on some G shit, baby
