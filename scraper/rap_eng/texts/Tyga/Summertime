[Intro]
This that feel good music right here..
Haha it feels good don't it?

[Hook]
Summer, Summer, Summer, Summertime, Remember those?
Summer, Summer, Summer, Summertime, The best times was the
Summer, Summer, Summer, Summertime, I love those
Summer, Summer, Summer, Summertime

[Verse 1]
Summertime, the right time, daytime, right length, right watch
Like the nice guy, fly guy wit a nice guy
Gucci top with the Nike highs
Or the LV with the V-Neck T
Fly, so fly on the beach
Beach chair loud
Damn, champagne from the liquor bank
On my way to the Chevron got a full tank
Now we ride and wherever he wanna go
She know I spend C notes on all my peoples
Well done, ain't nothing like the pool party fun
I got plenty drink, give the pool party some
Red rum the whole bottle of patron
But, no worries, baby I got more to poor
Catering from Roscoe's, Chicken and waffles
Together politicking blacks, whites, and Asians
I love

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh, the man rose with the millionaire stroke
From the 323, to the 310
I got my 23's on
Jordan's so important, with my fit already scorching
And then 15, before 7 to the Porsche's, we do the 23's
No rims, if you see them laid back, just hide til' the driver drive and some of em' get million dollar profits
Got it? Now put the Tyga CD in and stop poppin'
Meet the bad guy, they call me God in the blue Bugatti
Yeah I'm styling in the 6 series, with a bulk wallet
Stop it, hah, the sunset looking violent
Come vibe with em' get it poppin', no violence
No alarm sirens, just me and you cruisin'
To the music, this how a young boss do it

[Hook]
