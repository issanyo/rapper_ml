[Intro: Tyler Kinng]
All about tha racks, Ion care, you ain't even
Bout tha rack not the rack
She a bad lil stripper bitch, bad lil stripper bitch

[Hook: Tyler Kinng]
She gone throw da pussy back,back,back,back,back
She gone throw da pussy back,back,back,back,back
Just throw it bitch,gone shake it bitch
She gone throw da pussy back,back,back,back,back
She gone throw da pussy back,back,back,back,back

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Drop, drop it on the floo'
You know I'm high as fuck bitch, keep it on the low
She give me good head, call that shit sloppy joe
I'm the shit, smell chanel cologne
Westside, fat ass I get behind her
I'm in the pussy all night like a fucking dina
Nosey ass pinocchio, rappers be quiet
Say you getting more money than me, you a liar
Killing shit, gangster attire, bitches admire
You sweet as papaya, bandana and the ties
Life in the game don't jeopardize it
I'm the truth, put that on T-Rah, shit!

[Hook: Tyler Kinng]

[Verse 1: Tyler Kinng]
Bitch I run up in the spot, Run up in the spot
Playing with the heat like chris brown
Jumping in the pussy, like it my first time, she
Gone ride tha dick its ain't no stop sign, she gone make
A nigga come around with her with tha bands, rocking
With the vans, nigga on blood,I fuck her and her
Friend, fuck her and her friends, both them hoes
Trippin, i ain't playin, I ain't playing
I beat tha pussy up like she stole some, smoke
So much weed now ion know nothing, young nigga
Got tha cup nigga pour some, nigga roll some,i got
Pistol on bitch, bitch you got tha wrong one
Bitch i just want the head, leaning like a nigga
Broke his legs and nigga i ain't high
Nigga i ain't high, man i swear every single time
