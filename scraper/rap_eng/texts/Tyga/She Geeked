[Intro: Sean Garrett]
We did this shit here for the DJ

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Saw me pull up in that 458, she geeked
Saw so many other bitches on my dick, she geeked
She couldn't believe my ambiance
She love the way I speak, she geeked
She told me take em off she know we in the club, she geeked

[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
They used to call me young boy, bitches call me big boy now
I got my millies and millies up and my visa out
Now the young nigga got the old nigga in a chokehold
Now he askin me more questions than his bitch Coco
And ya know she wouldn't be on me but recession vs. money
Ain't the fight that you take when you up against a bank
She geeked, I keep all my receipts
A nigga don't sleep, they gon have to see me, free Weezy

[Hook] x2

[Break: Sean Garrett]
Add it up, Pimp Money, Young Money Cash Money nigga

[Verse 2: Tyga]
T-Raww mu'fucker, I'm geeked
Got my uncles rollin wit me, OGs
Homie girl say she want me, she freak
But I ain't fuckin with that bitch, she weak
Beep beep, who got the keys to my GT?
Young G don't I do my dougie fresh clean
Sean told me in this world money ain't a thing
Its Young Money throwin hundreds, act like ya want it
She know she want it on that pole ho, show me somethin
Show me that pussy, pop her panties, drop it into function
This beat got that booty bumpin
She think she seen it all but she ain't seen nothing

[Bridge: Sean Garrett]
She likes all the things she sees
The cars, the clothes and the jewelry
She don't wanna say it but I know she geeked
Geeked, geeked, ge-ge-ge-geeked

[Hook]

[Break: Sean Garrett]
Saw me pull up in that 458, she geeked
(Gucci!) Welcome home nigga, talk to me

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Got her geekin for the freakin, she tweakin, I mean she tweaked
Flew two friends in for the weekend, I'm humpin, the other peepin'
Told her she ain't gotta peep in, I'm game if they want a threesome
Say I'm man enough for both of em, I beat em up, got em sleepin
When they geekin off my inkin, I'm tatted, they wanna read me
Got her hungry for big daddy, burr feed her because she greedy
Got a townhouse in Miami, behave yourself and you'll see it
Got another spot in Cali, so lavish you wouldn't believe it
I'm a teacher, you's a geeker, no sneakers I'm wearing creatures
Got game that I'm not playing like baby I'm in the bleachers
Now Sean Garrett, that's my people, so really this not a feature
Just a verse to get em geeked up and show them they're not my equal
Now it’s my pleasure to meet ya and greet ya Ms. Mona Lisa
If you don't know all, I’ll teach ya, you're Cleopatra, I'm Ceasar
But soon as I freak her, I turn her into a geeker
Fuckin all on the speakers cause baby girl she so geeked up

[Hook] x2
