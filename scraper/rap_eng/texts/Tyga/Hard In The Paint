Uh, I ain't never been cheap

Snapback boy, take that fucking fitted off!
Fall to their knees
Plead for their right to breathe...
Lord please devour all my enemies!

Bitch now back up off me...
I'm that yellow gold boss and you looking Boston...
Walk the water if I could bitch I think I'm Moses...
Tell them shut the fuck up! with all that commotion
Counting money get enough...

I'm sizzlin' up hotter than a bowl of momma porridge...
Whole body covered in green like dinosaurs
Get me neck baby bend all your spinal cords
Uh, goofy ass goofy goofy
Tryin'a blend in like a mothafucka smoothie...
Take a seat you fucking up the movie
I'm on the couch standing while you staring at the movement
Young Money bitch I do this!
Hand in the mind, both sides, one lie, two crimes other side don't fire
Fully dazed like a dream
I ain't moving bitch we groovin'
Rell said it's 5 Duece Hoover, fully trippin I could prove it (uh)
Switch blade where ma boot is...
All that sweet talk leave a nigga to-toothless

And ma car doofus
Mikey rock chucks like cool kids (bitch)

Haters envy me cause they ang-ry
So if you want that beef

More famous then these no name niggas that you hanging with
All my homies on like the cables is...

No license, still drivin
Use to lease now I buy it
Ho cash blood diamonds...
Niggas violent, babies crying

But I never went to college (hahaha)
Can't live long in the imagination
Don't compare to no basic
