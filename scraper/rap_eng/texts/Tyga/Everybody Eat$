Yo everything ain't alright man?

You ain't eatin what you mean you ain't eatin you ain't making this paper man?
Everybody eats B!

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ugh, they sleepin' on 'em
Let 'em sleep
I crept in like a thief
I took the food, I left the jewels
Everybody eats
My crew, nigga everybody eats
You should let me cook, look how many mouths I feed
Shame on you, you doubted me
Shame on 'em
I'm at the stove, I got the flame on it
Everybody eats
Gold engraved name tags on everybody seats
The word don't fall at everybody's feet
I got the recipe, my nigga
Everybody eats
You ain't see it comin', you just see what everybody see
Think you right? Cause you think how everybody think
But mostly, everybody cheat

Gold rollies under everybody sleeve
Where was you when I was lonely, you only know me from the party
You wasn't there for my close calls
How close are we, huh?

She the only one who got her clothes off
New TV shows, that's just to show off
Play your role, dawg and everybody eats
All my niggas in the field

Boy that money a Motherfucker

And you.. (x5)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
(This everybody's dream, yeah I know)
When you gettin' dead presidents
The press'll want you dead
Then these rappers want beef
And I just want some head from my girl, ugh
Lunch at my favorite spot to eat
And link up with my niggas, yeah
Everybody eats
The game been on the brink of destruction
I try to let you have your lil' thing
Life's a bitch, you had your lil' fling
Love me unconditional, under any condition
I'm gettin' dope
My bank account statement a run on  sentence
Come to the playground with run yard niggas we up 50 up
We got everybody beat
You should let me cook, look how many mouths I feed
Shame on you, you doubted me
Shame on 'em

The word don't fall at everybody's feet

Shame on you, you doubted me
I know Doty'd be proud of me yeah
Smoke one on the cloud for me

And I was in the bank when these blogs was out of me
Who's writin' the story?
I mean who published the book
I mean you believed that shit
You was dumb as you look
You bum we gettin' bread come get a crumb if you smart
Over here, everybody eats

You should let me cook, look how many mouths I feed
Shame on you, you doubted me
Shame on 'em
I'm at the stove, I got the flame on it
Everybody eats
Gold engraved name tags on everybody seats yeah

[Chorus: Goapele]
This life, this life
This life, this life
Wasn't just made for me
I set this table from you
And you.. (x5)
This life, this life
