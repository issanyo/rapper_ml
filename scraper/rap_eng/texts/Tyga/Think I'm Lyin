[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Drop that coke in that hot water
And tell that bitch to hold her nose
Her name Tunechi Bitch
First name Tunechi, last name Bitch
It ain't no bitch, bitch
But it's Tunechi bitch
And right now, I'm here checkin' in for the mothafuckin' appreciation
Who the fuck is Stevie J?
If you don't know by now, you mothafuckas stupid, nigga
Fuck wrong with you?
LIV on Sundays
And money every mothafuckin' day, nigga

[Hook: Hood]
Man I'm richer than a bitch, ho, you must think I'm lyin'
Wake up, gotta get dough, you must think I'm lyin'
Got my jeweler fuckin' with me heavy, you must think I'm lyin'
You 'on't want it, you ain't really ready, you must think I'm lyin'
Man I'm richer than a bitch, ho, you must think I'm lyin'
Wake up, gotta get dough, you must think I'm lyin'
Got my jeweler fuckin' with me heavy, you must think I'm lyin'
You 'on't want it, you ain't really ready, you must think I'm lyin'

[Verse 1: Hood]
Big homie droppin' off the torch, I'm smokin' out the Porsche
Real life, street nigga, made a million off the court
I don't even fuckin' hoop, I can really run and shoot
Ho you know I give and go, I can really duck and move
Homie call Pusha T, ask him what's the bookin' fee
I don't need a fuckin' show, hit my kitchen, cook a ki
She say "Thank you", I say "Please, all this coke, you still want cheese?"
All that dope stuck in your nose, and you still gon' charge a G?
Ho you know it's so HB, we got the game like KBC
Gave the profit to my mom, I've been bumpin' Tracy T
I've been leanin', I've been fienin', I've been prayin' for my demons
You must think I'm lyin', I spent a hundred thou this evenin'

[Hook: Hood]
Man I'm richer than a bitch, ho, you must think I'm lyin'
Wake up, gotta get dough, you must think I'm lyin'
Got my jeweler fuckin' with me heavy, you must think I'm lyin'
You 'on't want it, you ain't really ready, you must think I'm lyin'
Man I'm richer than a bitch, ho, you must think I'm lyin'
Wake up, gotta get dough, you must think I'm lyin'
Got my jeweler fuckin' with me heavy, you must think I'm lyin'
You 'on't want it, you ain't really ready, you must think I'm lyin'

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got some niggas in this bitch that got some niggas in this bitch
Mean muggin' like we suckin' on a lemon in this bitch
I'ma ball even if I fail my physical and shit
And I'm all about my digits, goin' digital and shit
Jumpin' on the couch until I'm short winded in this bitch
Don't judge a book by it's cover, start skimming at you, bitch
Where my niggas that be poppin' them prescriptions? You ain't sick
Where my bitches that be fuckin' for that money? You ain't shit
And yo bitch don't make no tips, and that sip don't make me itch
My bitch always think I'm lyin', I said I don't, she said "Since when?"
I'm a dog like Rin Tin Tin, fuck y'all niggas, y'all some hoes
Don’t trust y’all niggas, talk in code, don’t walk, I stroll, don’t walk, I drove
So park my Rolls, don't spark, I glow, avoid my woes, I brought my bros
But that nina always workin', cause I can't fuck with the part-time hoes
My bitch pussy multipurposes, cause it take dick and hold my dope
Drop that coke in that hot water and tell that bitch to hold her nose

[Hook: Hood]
Man I'm richer than a bitch, ho, you must think I'm lyin'
Wake up, gotta get dough, you must think I'm lyin'
Got my jeweler fuckin' with me heavy, you must think I'm lyin'
You 'on't want it, you ain't really ready, you must think I'm lyin'
Man I'm richer than a bitch, ho, you must think I'm lyin'
Wake up, gotta get dough, you must think I'm lyin'
Got my jeweler fuckin' with me heavy, you must think I'm lyin'
You 'on't want it, you ain't really ready, you must think I'm lyin'

[Verse 3: Tyga]
10 mil' just last year, you must think I'm lyin', ho
I make cash, don't break even, I overlap your payroll
Straight to the point like Bledsoe, fuck that, I take the foul
Settle out, no time for trial, my lawyer's with me, better call Saul
First round draft pick, my lifestyle need a contract
I'm Bo Jack in Egypt, that Wraith smell like reefer
Who that, nigga? I beat them, like Redman, I'll be dat
187, no drill team, get drill bit
I pull up my shit to these niggas and flaunt, I'm the nigga she want
I got all the shit that she want, T-Raw her boss, Trell got a mil in a vault
I'm just bein' honest, oh you must think I'm lyin'
I'm not just an owner, baby, I'm also a client

[Hook: Hood]
Man I'm richer than a bitch, ho, you must think I'm lyin'
Wake up, gotta get dough, you must think I'm lyin'
Got my jeweler fuckin' with me heavy, you must think I'm lyin'
You 'on't want it, you ain't really ready, you must think I'm lyin'
Man I'm richer than a bitch, ho, you must think I'm lyin'
Wake up, gotta get dough, you must think I'm lyin'
Got my jeweler fuckin' with me heavy, you must think I'm lyin'
You 'on't want it, you ain't really ready, you must think I'm lyin'
