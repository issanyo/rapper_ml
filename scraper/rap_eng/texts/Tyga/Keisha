Jawan Harris:
Have you ever loved someone so bad
But they don't know you alive
Well I have...

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting just about all day
For you to come on around here (Yeah)
Cuz' I been trying to get at ya
But its been kinda hard to catch ya
(Ah Ooh) Ooh, Ooh
With all that pretty on your face
You don't even know what you did
(What you did, What you did)
You stole my heart from the start
Got me triippin' like...

[Hook]
Keisha, Keisha, oh Keisha
Shawty, I really want to meet ya
(Aye Keisha, Aye Keisha, Aye Keisha) Oh, Keisha
Get out the way
Keisha now coming through
Aye shawty what it do
Let’s talk about me and you

[Verse 2]
Now I ain’t tryna be impatient
I know all the guys are tryna get at you too, baby
Tell them they don’t leave you?, save it
Baby come play with the majors
I never get tired of waiting
Cuz’ I know you won’t be waiting sooner or later
And baby I ain’t gon stop until you make me your screensaver

[Hook]
Keisha, Keisha, oh Keisha
Shawty, I really want to meet ya
(Aye Keisha, Aye Keisha, Aye Keisha) Oh, Keisha
Keisha, Keisha, oh Keisha
(What I gotta do girl to meet you girl)
Shawty, I really want to meet ya

(Aye Keisha, Aye Keisha, Aye Keisha) Oh, Keisha

[Hook]
Slow down (Slow down), Slow down (Slow down)
Ain’t it bout time we got this show on the road now
Oh, I don’t want no one else
Only want you
Girl I barely even know you and look what you do

Cuz’ this is a man’s world
So you should be mine girl
You just dont know what you do to me
Keisha

[Tyga]
Girls are all the same, can’t lie
Maybe I’m just looking for the wrong thing
Love don’t come sooner or later
But for right now I’m gonna keep playin’
One day at a time
She the one? never mind
Wide awake, awla
Can’t love them, heart throb
Sink though, lock eyes now we both froze
I’m staring at you like old folks
When I move fast, but I gotta take it slow
For real though, I’m Tyga, nice to meet you
Ask her name she said her name was

Keisha, Keisha, oh Keisha
(I really want to meet you)
Shawty, I really want to meet ya
But I don’t know what I gotta do
Just to kick it with you

Keisha, Keisha, oh Keisha
Shawty, I really want to meet ya
Keisha
Hey Keisha…

(Aye quit playing girl)
(You know you like me back)
