[Verse 1: YG]
She asked me if I wanted right there and I said hell yeah
Started kissing on my ear, and I said hell yeah
Then I told her like you know what, we can do it in my Rover
You can get from the side, like the pistol in my holster
She says she wanted it rough, so I beat her up and I choked her
Got that Dodge Ram dick, bitch I'll leave that pussy dented
That pussy'll probably end up dead before I finish
She be all at my mouth like the dentist
Then she started playing with my balls like tennis
No ties, no suit, no booper, I give her the business
I got her saying "that's my dick" like she had it rented
Off my shit, you my bitch, now sit right here, and ride my dick

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She said daddy do you want some? I said hell yeah
Do I want in the chair? I said hell yeah
Do I want it in the kitchen? I said hell yeah
Do I want it in the bed? I said hell yeah
Lady, say hell yeah, lady, say hell yeah
Lady, say hell yeah, hell yeah

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, open up your leg, your thighs, let a nigga go peek inside
Don't worry about where your car is, I'mma get this dick to ride
I know it's Christmas eve, I'll fuck you under that tree
Legs in the air that's yo gift from me
Rick James Super Freak, grab your waist and now let me eat
Pipe game I'm a beast, you can say that I'm MVP
MP3, same song go on repeat
Suck your bottom lip, now climb on top of me!
I'm hard as a rock while I beat your butt like a pi√±ata
Says she love Young Money so I let her taste my dollars
We fell asleep, wet dreams
Her fantasies woke me up and she said

[Chorus]

[Bridge: YG]
She said do you want it in the kitchen? I say hell yeah
She said right beside the dishes? I say hell yeah
She said do you want it on the floor? I say hell yeah
She said right behind the door?

[Chorus]
