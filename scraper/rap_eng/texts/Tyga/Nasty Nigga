Uh, I met this girl on the South side
She was bad, and she always keep her mouth wide
She got me thinking about some things that I’m supposed to do
Girl, I’ve been calling cause I’ve been trying to get close to you
And don’t be mine with that man, I’ve been at work shit
I heard you and your husband try to work shit
I keep it pimping drop your name in my verses
But how your thighs been on your ass, got me nervous
I’m sipping alcohol and hoping I don’t burst quick
And this dick hard enough to make the Earth split
I put it in, and she told me that it hurt a bit
I know the whole hotel probably heard the bitch
She scream my name out tell me where my name at
On the ass I tried, but nothing came at
She lay me down and roll me like a Maybach
I grab that ass, suck them titties for the simlax cause

Chorus:
I’m a real nasty nigga
Girl, I’m a real nasty nigga
Say I’m a real nasty nigga
I’m a real nasty nigga
Shit, say I can get nasty with you
Girl, I can get nasty with you
Cause I’m a real nasty nigga
I’m a real nasty nigga

(TYGA)
Uh, bitch shut the fuck up, put that butt up
Put your face in the pillow, don’t you come up for air, bitch!
You feel that dick is right, yeah bitch
Pulling up your hair, choke you out, I’m like yeah, bitch!
You like that nasty shit, spin at it, put it in
Fucking for an hour long, then we’re straight fuck again
The sun come up, come on, you know I…
She licked the nut up, I’ll be the… like nut chucks
Eat the pussy, make you curl your toes up
..now we’re fucking slow motion
Roll up, coast ..speed it up because she’s rolling
Then impact the gap…
Nigga what?
..baby my sex game popping up
Make a bitch bad, tell that bitch to get on top of her
Turn the bitch out, now she don’t know what she about
Bang bang, kick ‘em out, come in her mouth, no doubt!

Chorus:
I’m a real nasty nigga
Girl, I’m a real nasty nigga
Say I’m a real nasty nigga
I’m a real nasty nigga
Shit, say I can get nasty with you
Girl, I can get nasty with you
Cause I’m a real nasty nigga
I’m a real nasty nigga

And now she turn that ass around for that 69
How many licks did you take, I’m on 89
That pussy taste like water, my favorite kind
I lick the tats on her back, yeah, every night
She’s speaking different languages when I get behind
I go deep up in that ass, trying to feel the spine
Strokes flow to that beat…
We hit it fast, but she’s telling me to slow it down
My nigga tell me to put her finger up in her butt
He told me that’s the fastest way to make these bitches nut
I let the bitch and keep fucking, until she find the love
I fell asleep into… until I’m waking up
It’s five thirty so honey, a nigga probably done
But missing on his dick he don’t pay…
I congratulate the bitch and put her knees up
In her chest I drop my deposit, I’ve been all…

Chorus:
I’m a real nasty nigga
Girl, I’m a real nasty nigga
Say I’m a real nasty nigga
I’m a real nasty nigga
Shit, say I can get nasty with you
Girl, I can get nasty with you
Cause I’m a real nasty nigga
I’m a real nasty nigga
