[Intro]
Everywhere I been
Every place I go
They all got one thing to call me
You see, they all call me
By one thing

[Hook]
(Tyga Tyga)
At my shows and we roll and scream, people see him and say
(Tyga Tyga)
So nice, gotta repeat me twice, now everybody say
(Tyga Tyga)
Don't matter what them other bitches say
I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm on my, on my way
Paragon Star, it's Tyga Tyga y'all

[Verse 1]
Both knuckles up, demos in the duffel, uh
Bad color Sepia, who said I ain't good for nothin'?
Respect my hustleness, madams get the mumbling
Cause I'm covered with color skin, ask her what my mama thinks
Along to my beats, these things compliments it's bad to see
Once laughed at me, cause I had a dream
Now they wanna relax, sit back with me
I recline, decline whenever they speak, no room to breathe
Look in my eyes, seen lies the truth defeat Gods who sized life
Knee-high, see y'all
One day after I die niggas, long ways
Got a strong case to demonstrate 'fore I elevate
As the swagger serenades, I see evil hate turn for great
Admission admire the non-fate, put the large cake on my plate
With a little bass, they scream and say

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How many marksmen you know in the local projects?
How many niggas hold you down when the shit is started?
Been counted, that's why I ain't heavy mobbin'
Got a low-key crib, cause bitches retarded
Repeat in they head, they with you
On some all day shit, too much talkin'
They get me nauseous
Small apartment, do all your dirty laundry
Cause word spread to everybody and they aunties
No pretzels, but shit is salty
Can't even trust the modest, you might spot 'em
Gold Herringbone pop shit, stop it
My details illegal mosh-pit
Honest, this kid is

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
On my way to the penthouse, tend a little me-ha
Her friend like meet her, you don't know Tyga?
She don't really care 'bout neither
Either, I'm too far where her mind can't reach up
Or she don't like music making money niggas
I do know that I ain't got time I maneuvers
Like that, voodoo, like that, you knew
Me don't, I'm already high rap guru
Fume, flew right past you with something to mac in and marry Catholics
Accurate to its adjective
Average chicks think I ain't baggin' 'em
I still go in, I just love it when they call him

[Hook]
