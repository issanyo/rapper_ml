[Chorus: Tyga]
Left, right, she go both ways
I think she might go both ways
Double R, headlights, go both ways
Left, right, take up both lanes

Left, right, she go both ways
I think she might go both ways
Double R, headlights, go both ways
Left, right, take up both lanes

[Post-Chorus: Tyga & æ]
Good or bad, she can go both ways
Told that supermodel gimme more face
I'm a star, bitch, I need more space
She make that ass talk, what it's gon' say?
(Purple pill, purple drink, twisted both ways)
She make that ass talk, what it's gon' say?
(Purple pill, purple drink, twisted both ways)
She make that ass talk, what it's gon' say?

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Pull up with a bop she go both ways
Car place, say raw, go AKA call me
When it's gangsta
Heartbreak take ya
Baby, make her mindset
No shirt, full service
Pop a pill, sitcom, let it work for you
Sip a little serve some
What's in my cup?
That purple stuff
I see two of ya
Diamond color, cool ripper
Cold nigga, ice glitter
Too many bitches
So many decisions
New locations
With easy conversations, no fake shit
Dollar racing, always finish first place, uh
Walk up in this bitch
I know what she came for
Lookin'

[Chorus: Tyga]
Left, right, she go both ways
I think she might go both ways
Double R, headlights, go both ways
Left, right, take up both lanes

Left, right, she go both ways
I think she might go both ways
Double R, headlights, go both ways
Left, right, take up both lanes

[Post-Chorus: Tyga & æ]
Good or bad, she can go both ways
Told that supermodel gimme more face
I'm a star, bitch, I need more space
She make that ass talk, what it's gon' say?
(Purple pill, purple drink, twisted both ways)
She make that ass talk, what it's gon' say?
(Purple pill, purple drink, twisted both ways)
She make that ass talk, what it's gon' say?

[Verse 2: æ]
Hey, black, white, she go both ways
Last night was crazy
How did we both make it?
Both faded, twisted both ways
Purple pill, purple drink, twisted both ways
'Cause I know ways to change your old ways
Had your own nigga wishin' for them old days
I fill the whole safe
That makes her feel so safe

[Outro: æ]
Purple pill, purple drink, twisted both ways
Twisted both ways
