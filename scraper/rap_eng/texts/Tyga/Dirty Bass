Dirty bass, I love that

[HOOK]
Dip low when I feel loco
Don't trip, make it dip like a lolo
Make it dip like a lolo
Then I roll-o, roll-o
Ooh I love that dirty bass
Ooh Ooh I love that
I love that, Ooh I love that dirty bass
Ooh Ooh I love that, I love that

[Kevnish]
I make girls jiggle right down the middle
My girl's from Assadena, she ain't that ghetto
She likes to sip the bub, VIP at the club
But when it comes to bass, my girl got a bangin' trunk

[J-Splif, BRIDGE]
Dig the way that you roll
With your bass down low
You can come to the crib
Leave your shoes at the door
You know what you're here for
Ain't that what you're here for
Girl, shake that dirty bass
Real girls get down on the floor

[HOOK]

[Tyga]
Go H.A.M. when the beat drop
Got beef, eat, eat it like a pork chop
And the bass pump, pump like a Reebok
Sitting so high in the Phantom like a tea cup
Heat thriller, bang at a scary n****
Big Willie, chillin' on the big wheela'
Your girl icky
Give me lick licky licky
No smalls, all biggie biggie
And she pop to the beat
Back, back it up, hear the beep beep
Come to L.A., life on the beach
And she give me brain, Screech
Club poppin', dirty bass, girls droppin'
Young Money, cash, got it
Now shake that ass, ass, ass, donkey

[HOOK]

[Prohgress]
I'll bang that woofer, if she's a looker
I'm cruising Hollywood and Vine, I don't want no hooker
I need a 5 foot freak for this FM freak
Let's take it back to the motel, now I'm in too deep

[BRIDGE]

I love that, the way we make it shake
[HOOK]
