[Pre-Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
These young niggas living like they ready to die, forever on fire
Pop a little, baby
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
No whippin', I'm going brazy
I flip it, it's so crazy
Crazy about the mula
Fire, you try to play me
Fire, you try to play me
You streamin' a million times but don't ever try to play me

[Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
Forever on fire, forever on fire
Forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
Forever on fire, forever on fire
Forever on fire, forever on fire, baby

[Verse 1]
Girl crazy
Saint Laurent and the cream Mercedes
She call me baby
I be stuntin' but you gotta pay me
Streets raised me it's crazy the whip's insane lately
Pussy got my mind hazy
Light up the mary jane
Bless, no complaining (Forever on fire, forever on fire)
Campaign and I'm a fashion statement
Moving state to state, here
One night only baby
Don't wanna be your lover, I ain't tryna play you
Play pretend, nose up
My diamond's on a glow up
I'm so high up, I can't look up (fuck)
I love it, we thugger when we're in public
I touch it, you get the hummin'
You bussin', you catch 'em look at my lady
(Forever on fire, forever on fire)
Not ready to die, we got way more time
I'ma light one, like 4 days in July
Let that motherfucker burn

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
These young niggas living like they ready to die, forever on fire
Pop a little, baby
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
No whippin', I'm going brazy
I flip it, it's so crazy
Crazy about the mula
Fire, you try to play me
Fire, you try to play me
You streamin' a million times but don't ever try to play me

[Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
Forever on fire, forever on fire
Forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
Forever on fire, forever on fire
Forever on fire, forever on fire, baby

[Verse 2]
Been platinum
You could stream it but don't ever play me
Stay ready, ain't gotta get ready
I drift the whip, race it like Andretti
Niggas is mean, petty
I mean heavy, blue money in a Gucci luggy
Caught my chick, glass nugget
Rings on every finger
They like, Phil coach em', must be god chosen
I'm good, better than ever
The Deal's sweet as nutella
Came from nothin' now we culture
Watch the rims let it soak in
Sun gon' shine, sun gon' shine
Bitch nigga, get on your job cuz I'm on mine
Bitch nigga, get on your job cuz I'm on fire
Pool on a rear, she wanna lay out and tan
Pulled up in the coupe
But I hopped out in Vans
You ain’t feelin’ me
You ain’t real to me
You don’t exist
So poof! - Vamoose, Son of a bitch!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
These young niggas living like they ready to die, forever on fire
Pop a little, baby
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
I'm rich and I'm girl crazy
No whippin', I'm going brazy
I flip it, it's so crazy
Crazy about the mula
Fire, you try to play me
Fire, you try to play me
You streamin' a million times but don't ever try to play me

[Chorus]
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire
I'm forever on fire, forever on fire, baby
