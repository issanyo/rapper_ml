[Bridge: Tyga & Jazmine Bailey]
W-w-we know
Boy, you know I like you, but... I don't normally do this
I don't normally, I-I-I don't normally
W-w-w-w-we know
Boy, you know I like you, but... I don't normally do this
I don't normally, I-I-I don't normally
W-w-w-w-we know
Boy, you know I like you, but... I don't normally do this
I don't normally, I-I-I don't normally
W-w-w-w-we know
Boy, you know I like you, but... I don't normally do this
I don't normally, I-I-I don't normally

[Verse 1: Jesse McCartney]
Sick, cool thing with wiggle made her giggle when I met her
She started off kinda hard to get, told her I'd get her
She said she likes 'em real, and real's what I'm gonna give her
I could tell she had a heart broke 'bout 3-4 times; girl by me, never
We at the movie, she all into me
I'm looking at her at the corner of my eyes...what's she doing?
She got up out of her seat, nowhere to be found, found
Her girlfriends looking for her, they don't know we fooling around, 'round

[Pre-Hook: Jesse McCartney]
She told me she ain't ever met no one that made her wanna
And she don't know what it is that has come over her
She giving me signals, like she done, she done fell in love
I don't know if that's what we're doing, but I wanna tear it up

[Hook: Jesse McCartney]
When we got to the car she said "I don't normally do this
Just keep your eyes on the road while I do this"
She was giving to me what I never saw given to  me
Opened my eyes, said "it's the first time", she don't normally do this
So we got to the house, and we're going
Still can't believe my eyes and the things that she's doing
Cut off every light like we still at the movie
Girl, you feel so good, I thought you don't normally do this

[Bridge: Tyga & Jazmine Bailey]
Boy, you know I like you, but... I don't normally do this
I don't normally, I-I-I don't normally
W-w-w-w-we know
Boy, you know I like you, but... I don't normally do this
I don't normally, I-I-I don't normally
W-w-w-w-we know

[Verse 2: Jesse McCartney]
Now we're getting deeper, now you wanna own me
Telling me I gotta only be your one and only
Can't lie, you got everything that I ever wanted
Shape on fire like a younger Beyonc√©
The sexy things you do to me, I can't stop
I love the way you surrender
Then how you make me come and get you
Then Michael J. 'Rock With You'

[Pre-Hook: Jesse McCartney]
She told me she ain't ever met no one that made her wanna
And she don't know what it is that has come over her
She giving me signals, like she done, she done fell in love
I don't know if that's what we're doing, but I wanna tear it up

[Hook: Jesse McCartney]
When we got to the car she said "I don't normally do this

I don't normally, I-I-I don't normally
W-w-w-w-we know
Boy, you know I like you, but... I don't normally do this
I don't normally, I-I-I don't normally
W-w-w-w-we know

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Focus, New shit
Booty Beauty
Ooh wee
I told you introduce me
"Hey how you doin'?"
I said "my name is" (doing)
But you already knew this
So don't be acting stupid
A-alright, I'm everything these girls like
I know it ain't your first time, so don't be acting shy
I-I run my fingers through your hair
Then I lay you on the bed
After that, she say

[Bridge: Tyga & Jazmine Bailey]
W-w-we know
