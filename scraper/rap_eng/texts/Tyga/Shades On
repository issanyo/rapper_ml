[Hook]
When they hatin' on ya, hatin' on ya, hatin' on ya
I turn around and put my shades on
When they hatin' on ya (put your shades on

[Verse 1]
Big money with the power
Killing haters off by the hour
Hop off the jet to the towers
Both top floors are ours
How could you?
Not love, love, love what you into
I'm in a magazine now it's an issue
Go cry baby here
Go a tissue, and go a tissue
Call me when you get through
Cause I be where the bars is low
Yellow charms and the cars is go
So onto the dawn, we toast
If they get too close
Just remember though

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bow to what you now witness
Lyrical chemist, cage with the kitties
Can't get my name on my menace
If I said it, then I meant it
When you hear it, don't forget it
Hit it off Downtown in a Phantom
That's what I heard from a bird whisper
Ask him where the liquor
Getting at bitches, saying on Twitter
They see me from a distance (really)
Cause I be where the bars is low
Yellow charms and the cars is go
So onto the dawn, we toast
If they get too close
Just remember though
