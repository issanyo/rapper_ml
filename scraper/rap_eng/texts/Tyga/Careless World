[Part 1]

[Intro]
I awoke from a dream
Filled of a world full of greed and hate
The world was my thoughts, and surroundings
I realized I needed to rise... and become king
My own destiny

[Hook]
Take a look around, tears from they eyes
Knees on the ground, money in the sky
Take a look around, ain't shit nice?
Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night

[Verse 1]
Take a look around, the city on fire
It's all taking place in the middle of my mind
I stand in the middle, cause death right beside
Murdering is simple, get your life simplified
Where the bones lie, rebuild another life
America's pie, put my hand in the pot
I can't get caught in the streets I was taught
Raised off anger, but it wasn't my fault
Nigga, take a look around, it's needles on the ground
Never gave three fucks, and I still don't now
I'm fucking in the house, babysitter on the couch
Thirteen like, "What this shit coming out?"
Pass me a jimmy, I ain't ready for a child
I hope nobody hears: "Bitch, why you so loud?"
Turn on the tube, put my head on the cloud
Breathe, inhale, the angels can't help, Tyga
Take a look around
Take a look around

[Hook]
Take a look around, tears from they eyes
Knees on the ground, money in the sky
Take a look around, ain't shit nice?
Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night
Take a look around
Take a look around

[Part 2]

[Hook]
All night, fighting em for my life
Praying that everything gon be right (Take a look around)
Ain't it nice, truth over the lies?
Young knight we kings in disguise (Take a look around)
I ride around in my city, bitches pictures up in they titties
Man, you fake, all of us know it, I'm original and I show it

[Verse 2]
Roll one time for everyone down and
T-two times for the nigga that bounce
Then why you sitting round on some couch shit
My money building, like houses
Feeling like you wise, truth be told, it's all lies
These the days of out lives, why you wasting all of your time?
Voices from the skies said that evil fall in yo rise
They judge me low to the dirt
Then they celebrate to of my highs
Why you, why you wanna be fake? I fucking hate you
Why you made cause I ain't take you?
Last day alive, I wouldn't even date you
"I'll replace you with somebody better" that you only make up
We just make up, wake up king and queen
And rule the world a little later
Later on in that day, tears all in her face
I said I’m going away, she begging me to stay
Took a look in her eyes, then she put my hands on her waist
Said, “Don’t leave, we’ve got a baby on the way”
Take a look around

[Hook]
All night, fighting em for my life
Praying that everything gon be right (Take a look around)
Ain't it nice, truth over the lies?
Young knights, we kings in disguise (Take a look around)
I ride around in my city, bitches pictures up in they titties
Man, you fake, all of us know it, I'm original and I show it
(Take a look around)
I ride around in my city, bitches pictures up in they titties
Man, you fake, all of us know it, I'm original and I show it
(Take a look around)

[Outro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
I want you to know tonight
That we, as a people, will get to the promised land
And I’m not worried about anything, I’m not fearing ANY man
My EYES have seen the glory, of the coming of the Lord
