[Intro: Kid Ink & Chris Brown]
You ain't gotta, uh
You ain't gotta, uh, leave
I think I got a, haha
Yeah, yeah, uh, leggo

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I said, you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta leave
My bad, I know this ain't usually your scene
But don’t worry about it, girl, just be yourself
And I swear, I ain't gon', I ain't gon' say a thing
Now gon' just have the time of your life
The time of your life, let it go
Go, go, go, and have the time of your life
Time of your life, baby, let it show

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
(Yeah, yeah)
Now, let me show you how we livin' (uh)
Wouldn't trade the world for this feelin'
Puttin' on for my city, up and away to the limit (yeah)
Head high, in the sky, they can’t see us, baby girl, we 'bout to get it
Had the time of your lifestyle
Actin' so shy, see the fireworks comin'
It's the Fourth of July up in this bitch, uh, jumpin' like a 64′
Get about your day, put this bottle on your lips go
All the away said
That all I need in this world full of greed is my bitch and my team, tell 'em (woo!)
That you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta trip
I won’t say a thing, baby girl, plead the Fifth

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I said, you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta leave
My bad, I know this ain't usually your scene
But don’t worry about it, girl, just be yourself
And I swear, I ain't gon', I ain't gon' say a thing
Now gon' just have the time of your life
The time of your life, let it go
Go, go, go, and have the time of your life
Time of your life, baby, let it show

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, sunshine, Golden State
She make a wish, I cut the cake
Appetite for love, she the recipe
She so on my level when it’s fuck whoever disagree
Spendin' time, spendin' money, we overseas
New estate, R8, she get the keys
One thing that I'm guessin', she don’t probably know recession
All that beauty on your face, niggas pay 'cause they can’t pace
I don’t play, I just lay, lay my game down flat
Told her this for one night only, if you comin', bring her back
'Cause I probably won’t be back, it's a party where I'm at
It’s a party in my pants and you invited with all that ass, goddamn, goddamn

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I said, you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta leave
My bad, I know this ain't usually your scene
But don’t worry about it, girl, just be yourself
And I swear, I ain't gon', I ain't gon' say a thing
Now gon' just have the time of your life
The time of your life, let it go
Go, go, go, and have the time of your life
Time of your life, baby, let it show

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
(Ha, haha)
They be nigga that’s the shit, I be like nigga that's that what?
Girl, you know that I'm gon' take you down, let that molly turn you up
This might go right over your biscuit but my shit is predator
And you the price so I'ma slay, beat it up, beat it up
They be like why she walk like her shit don’t stink?
'Cause that's my bitch, what you think?
Shine in the night, the time of your life
A nigga like you can't you afford these drinks
Been grindin' hard since kindergarten
Fuck that nigga, I am the party
That’s that shit, that real life shit
That real life shit, I've been about it

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Yeah, uh, I been about it, you can ask your friends about me ('bout it, huh)
I know that they know how we get down to the very bottom
And I bet you never had this much fun with anybody (no)
You can tell your man don’t worry about us, bitch (what?)

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I said, you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta leave (yeah)
My bad, I know this ain't usually your scene (tell 'em)
But don’t worry about it, girl, just be yourself (Alumni, Up and Away)
And I swear, I ain't gon', I ain't gon' say a thing (June 12th, it's Kid Ink)
Now gon' just have the time of your life
The time of your life, let it go
Go, go, go, and have the time of your life
Time of your life, baby, let it show (ooh)
