[Hook: Tyga]
Tell these bitches, I'm the man
Money over bitches, nigga that’s the plan
Everything I do
Weh, weh, weh, weh,well done(x2)
Nigga say they ballin' they in the stands
If it ain’t 'bout business don’t shake my hand
Everything I do
Weh, weh, weh, weh,well done(x2)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Pop Up Motha Fucking man
Walk up clear the way its the ambulance
Fire truck; get to the fire in advance
Pop flow, I just, I just gave the track a tan…
Ain’t a damn thang, we popping champagne
Girls say they choose they rootin for the other team
I put her in the Vibe, like the magazine
You see us raining hundreds cash is the cream
And cream get the money, and money make her scream
Nothing personal, it was just a quick fling
But now I’m back to me, paper off the shelf, bitch
She, just wanna get drunk, get fucked, taste dick
Maybe make a new friend, get in benz with him
This ain’t no simple life, you dancing with a star, bitch
Yeah, yeah!
So keep my spot light bright
Cause I’m a be in it all night

[Verse 2: Tyga]
All about my paper, ain't another feeling greater
Came up like elevators, now I ball like a laker
They like my freestyle, but they gonna have to pay me
Candy red maro tell that bitch its now or later
Six speed brand new cars smell flavor
Look up in the sky, thank God that we major
There’s cash to be made, world full of danger
So we’re gonna count it underneath the table, it'll be safer
Ace paid in full all hundreds big jewels
Stones kinda heavy, slick rick the rule
Godly god, I’m nawrly man, the rawest in the group see me party out the roof son flyer in the coupe
She love it cause the feeling, fucking on the million
Flying you in the morning right now, we chilling
Stuck in the moment, then she back to her life
I’m back to the money, cause money my life
