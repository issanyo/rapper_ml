Tyga

Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Until they realize they
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever

Once upon a time, rhyming, working at part time
Designers pricing it too high, im just trying to be fly
Categorized, closet full of Louis, cuz da hundreds fluent
Who knew we doin there's more to this youtube money, chewing
Review my struggle to it, rockiest roads
And ice cream cuz environments around me endangering
Never knew it too busy sharp shooting
Little fishes don't get caught by this harpoon bitch
Its just music meet my instruments
OG say get your loose leafs, think in the margin kid
Never be too big for the littlest ship
Ripken, for clowns who don't think the Cal hit shit
Or how gangsta it gets when you don't portray the images
Remembering Pac's last picture
In the back of my mind stuck since September, nah Im six you niggas
If you there, enter knock before i switch ya agenda
Body temperature zero, spirit missing, I should have listened

Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Until they realize they
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever

Somebody body by that neighborhood party
Now he hot and street mama want answers but we remain in silent
No we glade it, cremate it, funeral, play the violins
What a sad time it is, society ran by communists
Obama that could improve how sick i am
Conglomerant diamonds shinin, show i got the upper hand
Fuck the middle man, current discussions with the president
And the PM with the baddest bitch AM I am Uncle Sam
Kids, Nephew, Im more on some father shit
Good nigga but don't follow him like simon says
You ain't it, but Im playing tag again, destined to be big
Greatest ever player, Im in this game to fucking win
School skipped gym, i rather get gems, dead faces on my marble table
Coppin' shit you are not able, i static it like bad cable
Get mashed, choir threwin, potato that choir sing, he won't make it

Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Until they realize they
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever

Finally found the comedy, niggas title me
Got rid of the small quantity, now Im killing
Its such an irony when you weigh the same height as me but afraid to say hi to me
Goodbye to the beats, beauty lies in passenger seats
Of each flat black SUV tinted for the celebrator driver GED chauffeurin
Im...sorry for reincarnating the lord
Hence scars cover my pores safari with Tyga aboard
Horse bitches back it up, all cuz they seen the bucks
Counting 1,2,3,4 like Ray Allen was
Balances looking like Hammer's funds, past not present
Dumb fucks getting drugged up, i probably bet ya fuckin' luck
You won't get higher than us, status of a Jordan jump
Ya swaggers off a mannequin, my shit randomly tough
Nigga what? I die a today, at least I live it up
You losers don't even know what you living for nigga c'mon

Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
Until they realize they
Won't live forever
But almost everybody
Wants to live forever
