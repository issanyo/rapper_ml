[1st Verse]
First off let me clear my chest
Started off on baby steps
We get right to the moment where babys come next
Grab tight holdin our self to whats nothin left
Two choices Im ya boyfriend or lets just forget
After dat you plead like I can't believe what we did
So only option was to agree and keep it secret
Or ya friends will make ya think that ya just another cheerleader
On his team, Tyga man a playa
See but, don't believe what ears can hear and eyes can not see
You seeing me on a daily baby
Wheres my time for another lady?
Get over it, trust me, faithfully, i can be all that you need

[Chorus]
Say you want to let me go and
Thats gonna have to end
You can Go and getta new boyfriend
But you'll never getta better boyfriend
Love just ain't our way but
You know i don't pretend
Imma go and getta new girlfriend
Imma get myself a better girlfriend

[2nd Verse]
[Girl Talks on Answering Machine]

Dear Ma
Misses She left ya guard down
For girbuads and riches
So we tore the mall down
And therefore fullfilled your little wishes
No more penny, pigeon, chowing at places
Dinner to reservations
I'm so on to this lifestyle
I put you on to it baby, Tyga Style
Just don't run from it cuz theres carpets every where we roam now
Profits for party poppin wit popular crowds
Getty images flickering, Perez Hilton
Liker her dress was ridiculous, complements of Tygas dispense
I come at dem like Pete Wentz
Don't worry its all coming back in the end

[Chorus]
Say you want to let me go and
Thats gonna have to end
You can Go and getta new boyfriend
But you'll never getta better boyfriend
Love just ain't our way but
You know i don't pretend
Imma go and getta new girlfriend
Imma get myself a better girlfriend

[3rd Verse]
Wait, so this is how we plan it
Benifit friends and relationships don't mix
But don't trip, cuz you i'm far over with
Long John Silver sick
And this boat no longer floats for you goldfish
Go dig another ditch cuz im dead done wit dis
Im hangin up now, My new girl shes in the front now
I know that gotta hurt
Time to answer her
Well i guess its true
Stick to the player rules

[Chorus] (2x)
Say you want to let me go and
Thats gonna have to end
You can Go and getta new boyfriend
But you'll never getta better boyfriend
Love just ain't our way but
You know i don't pretend
Imma go and getta new girlfriend
Imma get myself a better girlfriend
