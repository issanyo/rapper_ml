[Intro: Neon Hitch]
There's no light in this room
It's all right, we got you
You shine like goooooold, ooooold
You walk by, cause a scene
All the girls, they agree
You shine like goooooold, ooooold

[Verse 1: Neon Hitch]
It's good to meet you, beautiful creature
You got my heartbeat racing like a cheetah
Don't need no lights, so turn them off
Give me a Tylenol
Because my head keeps spinning like a disco ball-all-all-all

[Pre-Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I can tell that your love is blinding
Electric touch, I feel you inside me
And I wanna know, yeah, I just gotta know
Can you light me up when we're alone

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
There's no light in this room
It's all right, we got you
You shine like goooooold, ooooold
You walk by, cause a scene
All the girls, they agree
You shine like goooooold, ooooold

[Verse 2: Neon Hitch]
It's like I'm speechless, and I can't speak
Cause you took the words from me, you are my weakness
You're sweeter than the cinnabon, a bite is all I want
You got the whole room glowing, everybody knows-ows-ows

[Pre-Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I can tell that your love is blinding
Electric touch, I feel you inside me
And I wanna know, yeah, I just gotta know
Can you light me up when we're alone

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
There's no light in this room
It's all right, we got you
You shine like goooooold, ooooold
You walk by, cause a scene
All the girls, they agree
You shine like goooooold, ooooold
You shine like-

[Verse 3: Tyga]
What you want, diamonds and gold
Lifestyles of a Penthouse floor
Right now I'm kinda into what you like
So tomorrow night, no regrets, let it all flow
And if you got some bad bitches
I take 'em nightly court-side, looking at a Laker
Then later she calling me, baby
Like what comes after labor, labor, labor
Rich-ass neighbors
Gold in a car, now we shine like sabers
Two million ladies, two million light years
And I still wouldn't change ya
Waiter, waiter, can I get another shot of that 'Tron
Cause I'm on a whole 'nother level called gone
She my queen, I'm King Hakeem
No limelight gon' ever turn me shady, I dream

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
There's no light in this room
It's all right, we got you
You shine like goooooold, ooooold
You walk by, cause a scene
All the girls, they agree
You shine like goooooold, ooooold
You shine like gold
