[Hook]
I don't know what to do sitting here alone
Just waiting on a cue
Cause I don't wanna fuck with you No more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I don't wanna fuck with you I don't know what to do
Sitting here alone, just waiting on a cue
Cause I don't wanna fuck with you no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I don't wanna fuck with you

[Verse 1]
Man fallin' into love to deep too much pressure
I don't wanna feel too weak
You be hearing all these bitches just talking about me
And if it's bout beef you'll take it to the street
I know I see you don't wanna be seen
But baby I'm a star and this is my team
I work too hard, to be arguing picking up my phone
And it ain't even ring
Even got some issues, some problems of your own
But I ain't gonna put you out there on the song
I'd be wrong if I did even talking about a kid
Put my past relationship that false information bitch
I thought you knew me better than that never did, not a fact
I don't even go time to be explaining that
I know shit ain't the same but some times niggas gone change, change now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of that, ain't calling back
Ain't fucking with you, like the virgins back
Man, shit was all good just a week ago now im blowing up
Turn me up in your speaker ho
Speaking on the wrong shit now you gotta go sick of your
Face and your friend is the antidote
And ain't tryin' to go and fuck with anybody
But I'm a fuck around and fuck somebody
Like bullies on playgrounds, new pussy I just found knock down
Laid down throwin' the towel out
When I'm at this rate I probably never press redial, callin all yo loud ass friends in the background
I'm better now,I'm better now got a new bitch
I ain't gonna put her out like I put you out. This time I ain't playin' around
