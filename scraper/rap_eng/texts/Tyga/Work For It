[Chorus: Poo Bear]
I'mma make you work for it
I'mma make you work
I'mma make you work for it
I'mma make you work
Ooh, I'mma make you sweat for it
The good kind of hurt
I'mma make you work for it
I'mma make you work

[Verse 1: Poo Bear]
You wanna turn me out
Wanna make me scream your name
You wanna be in full control
You don't want me to maintain
Who do you think you are
Acting like you're in charge
Underestimating me
Thinking that I don't go hard

[Chorus: Poo Bear]
I'mma make you work for it
I'mma make you work
I'mma make you work for it
I'mma make you work
Ooh, I'mma make you sweat for it
The good kind of hurt
I'mma make you work for it
I'mma make you work

[Verse 2: Poo Bear]
Looks like the table's turned
Did you wanna tap out
My theory's been confirmed
I can tell by the sound
You wanna take a break
Cuz I took your breath away
What happened to all the talk
Now you don't got nothing to say

[Chorus: Poo Bear]
I'mma make you work for it (I'mma make you work for it)
I'mma make you work (Oohh yeah)
I'mma make you work for it
I'mma make you work (Yeah)
Ooh, I'mma make you sweat for it (I'mma make you sweat)
The good kind of hurt (Oooh)
I'mma make you work for it (I'mma make you work for it)
I'mma make you work (Hey)

[Verse 3: Tyga]
What you about five five
You don't work no nine to five
A girl like you probably seen on a movie screen
Engagement rings, damn you fine
That ass though I make all the time
Been busy you know how I grind
Pull up I'mma slide it aside
Late night spend the night
Fuck it, bath soap, bed silk
Sheets match my fur pillows
Copperfield, feel good you know it's real
High up this the high life
Playa real check my highlights
Keep your heels on with hindsight
Handcuffs rolling sex dice
Sex right, love love tonight
Got a whole list things to do, do to you
If it's alright, alright
Submissive you could beg for it, go on beg for it
Spread you legs get ready for it, get ready for it

[Chorus: Poo Bear & Tyga]
Yeah, I'mma make you work for it, ready for it
I'mma make you work, get ready for it
I'mma make you work for it, she beg for it
I'mma make you work
Ooh, I'mma make you sweat for it
The good kind of hurt
I'mma make you work for it
Better be careful who you fuckin' with
