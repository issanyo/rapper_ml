[Hook]
Deep in my heart!
Got me this far!
Follows me in the dark!
So I copped the new car!
Washed down my thoughts!
Makes me feel nause!
This lifestyle brought!
I'm in so f-a-r!

[Verse 1]
First off let me clear this up
This was never your dream
Now this is what you want!
This life just ain't reality to me!
Being a star is how I breathe!
But u don't wanna let me succeed!
(Why!)
Now there is people after me!
Low key!
I ride!
No high key!
Tires! Low pro!
There go Tyga!
Dey know!
Every verse I flow
Times two!
His flow so cold!
Dey knew!
So they stuck around like
Bubble gum on shoes
Waiting patiently for the food!
How many can u feed with one spoon!
Got damn nigga let me tie my shoe!
I just wanna be in the game and run too!
Fall back! Relax ma nigga!
And I'll lace u!
And take u to a place u can only dream!
This industry shady!
So I keep it real on the daily!
Tyga man I was your friend!
Now it's!

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Pain is pressure
That never intended to get a nigga like me!
Ha-ha that's what I feel pain is!
How come!
When someone betters they self they run!
And tell someone else
He ont help he ont care
He for self fuck his wealth
That's how I feel!
When I'm performin on the stage!
This shit just fills my rage!
Shout out to rage!
He said
"Fuck what they say! "
Let the haters hate cuz now I'm paid!
Coconut juice u was there too!
Coconut juice in the booth!
Youtube! Youtube can't witness the truth!
I've been doin this with or with out u niggas!
Tyga I will not house u niggas!
I will shit on u boys in house shoes niggas!
I was Your voucher!
Should of kept Your mouth shut niggas
U could of had cheese!
U mouse ass niggas!
