[Verse 1]
I think I started something
New chick, just started fucking
Kinda early but I know we both love it
We both rushing
We can add titles but then we both cuffing
Rolling in the sheets until midnight moaning
I'mma go down south, then call it (?)
Pussy pink like like a lotus
I'mma eat it good like something out of lars
I'm all good like a summer day
Blowing out the cake, blowing novocaine
She really shouldn't but she prone to the lifestyle
TAC, ecstasy, in the white cells
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
Baby pick up
Heard she with some niggas, ballplayers, playing pickup
My pretty little princess, now she promiscuous
Supposed to be my misses, out here fucking niggas
I ain't tripping, I'mma get another bitch
I don't mean the shit, it's too hard to end the shit
I'd rather stay than call it quits
And now we fall in love again

[Verse 2]
Real nigga got hoes on my dick, oh
Couldn't see 'em, love how my eyes closed
Now I see 'em, ain't nothing worth it though
Rather be with you than out here a lonely soul
On the road, entertainment hoes
Bitches I don't know tweeting from their camera phones
Man this shit getting old
I just hope we still involved
