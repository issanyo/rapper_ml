[Hook]
Rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts
I need a bitch with an ass that bounce
A fat ass and titties that bounce
You know I'm in the street when the city come out
When the city dumb out
When you envision me
(Can you tell me) am I getting it though?

[Verse 1]
I'm a rap star, call the task force
I make your club collapse
After I leave with the bad ones
Presidential suite with the bad ones
Told my niggas ya'll can have them
Cause I have one, I'm on FaceTime with her
When she blowing you kisses, saying she miss ya
Could have anyone she want, she just wanna be with ya
I'm a rap star, I just wanna get richer
You might slip when I talk, you know I'm slick when I talk
Rap star, got plaques on my wall
That's art and facts on my wall
Crib I bought got two gates for security guards - it's a palace dog!
I remember when I have it dog
And back then I was still saying I'ma have it dog!

[Hook]
I'm a rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts
I need a bitch with an ass that bounce
A fat ass and titties that bounce
You know I'm in the street when the city come out
When the city dumb out
When you envision me
(Can you tell me) am I getting it though?

[Verse 2]
I'm a rap star, can you imagine?
Putting chains on ya man's neck, cause the muscle stronger the fan flexin'
Dealing with gossip, hate and threats
When they bettin' against you and you raise the bet
Yeah, you got 'em there nigga, you got 'em scared
They not prepared, you got 'em right where you want 'em, right there
I'm a rap star and your nightmare
Used to slapbox, now we don't fight fair
Life ain't, so I ain't
This about my team, cause they ate when I ate
Yeah they steak like my steak
Handle they beef like it's on my plate
I'm a rap star that graaa, graaa, graaa
That "move, let 'em through, get back"

(Could you imagine?)

[Hook]
I'm a rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts
I need a bitch with an ass that bounce
A fat ass and titties that bounce
You know I'm in the street when the city come out
When the city dumb out
When you envision me
(Can you tell me) am I getting it though?
