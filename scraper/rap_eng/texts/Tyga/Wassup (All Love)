[Hook]
Dont You Worry About The Beef My Nigga
Everything's Straight
When You See Me In The Hood
Dont Worry You Ain't Gotta Hate

Wassup Wassup Wassup (Its All Love)
Wassup Wassup Wassup (Its All Love)

Shit, We All In A Recession
Nigga Im Broke Too
I See You Lookin At Me
What The Fuck I Do To You

Wassup Wassup Wassup (Its All Love)
Wassup Wassup Wassup (Its All Love)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Look, Hate To Glit It
Wrist In Hand
This Ain't No Little Man
Just Presidential Rolex And
This Is My Biggest sin
Jealously attracting them
Trying My Best To Do Less
Trying my best But, Im Such To A Greater Extent
My Phone Rings, A Block Call, 2 A.M
Who could it be?
Not moms, she with auntie
Tropezing, smiling saying her son paid it
Like If One Make It
We All Made It

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Tyga]
Im Tryna To Be Paitent Homie
But All This Hatin On Me
Got Me Thinkin Satan On Me
I Dont Owe Em, But My Whole Circle Waitin On Me
If I Dont Show Em, Make Moves, They Gone Be Skatin On Me
Now This Basement Lonely
Or We On That Tv Doin That
Matter Fact, I Think Ima Give Em A Call Them Back
But I Ain't Got Time For All That
Tryna Give Me Gifts So They Can Say They Bought That
Agree,What You Want From Me
A Bag Full Of Money?

[Bridge]
All My Westside Riders Wassup, Wassup
All My Eastside Riders Wassup, Wassup
All My Northside Riders Wassup, Wassup
And All My Southside Riders Wassup, Wassup

L.A. N.Y. Wassup (Its All Love)
M.I.A. VA Wassup (Its All Love)
Chi City, Detroit Wassup (Its All Love)
H Town Boston Wassup (Its All Love)
