[Intro: Tyga]
Shorty got the best head ever (got damn, for you, got damn)
Shorty got the best head ever
And I can tell that you on your way to the top
Shorty got the best head ever
I'm fucking with you, I'm fucking with you

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ain't nothing to a man, scale on a digit
When I do it gotta do it way different
No shit like 1-9 trippin'
Never had a cab in my city
Bitches all in my air, you fucking with me
Cause ain't shit realer
Crazy on my line, run the game like Pepe
Young nigga gotta get it
She know she can get it, but I be fucking with her cold
Want a slick thim A1, get my young day gone
Shots of that Patron, Henny had me all gone
Tell them bitches come get some
It ain't fun if the homies can't get none, uh
Tell her relax and pour more up and don't throw up
Or ride dolo and get no dough, you know what
Bro, I got a lot of dough, and I can make you my money ho

[Hook: Tyga]
Shorty got the best head ever
And I can tell that you on your way to the top
Shorty got the best head ever
You know I'm fucking with you
I let you know I'm fucking with you
Shorty got the best head ever
And you just wanna play, make your way to the top
Shorty got the best head ever
I let you know I'm fucking with you, I'm fucking with you

[Verse 2: Game]
I got a bitch named Superhead, she give super head
Just moved in the building, even gave the super head
I got big guns, that's bitch super legs
So play Superman and we gon' play moving chairs
Off with your head, nigga, you don't really want it
Blood Money, Last Kings, that bullshit we on it
That long bread we got it, that Rolls Royce we in it
The bitches we got bad so no cars get tinted
No cars get rented, got the Masi' all Schmurda'd out
La Familia, the clique that you heard about
20 bottles, nigga, couple million follow, nigga
Red rag, gold chain, bet your girl swallow, nigga
Ciroc to the head, she gon murder the whole case
Pass her the Hookah cause he gon' puff like the old Mase
Make a nigga wanna empty out the whole safe
Nutting on her whole face, swear to God

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eric Billinger]
I don't know what you call that
When you make my toes curl and my eyes roll back
Keep doing it to me, just keep doing it to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby girl, tell your nigga fall back
You already on your knees so I let you crawl back
After giving  to me
He ain't gotta know you giving it to me
So when you leave her stop at the 7/11, get some Listerine strips
Sucking the jewels, I'mma crown you on your queen shit
Killing it, baby
Make a nigga wanting to spilling it, baby
Yeah, yeah, oh, she got the best head ever
Shorty got the best head ever, best head ever
