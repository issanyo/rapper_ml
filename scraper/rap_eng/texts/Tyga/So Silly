Tyga:
Don't Blame Yourself And Don't Blame Me
Cause We Was Both Fell In Love On A High Speed
Chasing Everything In Life But The Right Things
Said You
Wanted Space, So I Made You Leave
You Came Right Back Said You Left Your Keys
Wanted Space, So I Made You Leave
Little Argument, Tears On Your Cheek
Now Im Standing Here Feeling So Cold
Should We Work It Out? I Don't Even Know
Your Friends Always Tryin' To Butt In
Cause They Ain't Got No-One Like Yo Man
Look Broman I Don't Play That We Friend
Tell That Looker Lose Your Number Or I'ma Lose Him
Its Always Two Sides Of The Story
And Now I Wanna Hear Yours Just Boring
Could Of Compromised, Kept Going But Now It's Over
And I'm Sorry

Jasmine:
Uh Uh, Uh Uh No No Way
You Won't Get The Best Of Me
I Don't Play
Uh Uh, Uh Uh, Get Up Out My Face
Boy I'm Goin An Attitude With You Baby
Love Ain't Suppose To Hurt This Bad
I Was The Best You've Ever Had
Now All You Do Is Make Me Mad
Cause You Try To Play With My Love
Oh I'm So Over It
I'm O-V-E-R-I-T-Z

Yeah
I'm So Over You
You Play Me For A Fool
Theres Nothin' Left For Me To Do

Chorus:
'Cause I Gotta Pack My Bags
And Get Up Out Of Here
You Ain't Gonna Stop Me Baby
Look At What You Had My Love
Now I'm Walking Out The Door
I Ain't Gonna Love You No More
How Could I Be So Silly
So So Silly , So So Silly, So Silly
How Could I Be So Silly
So So Silly , So So Silly, So Silly
How Could I Be
Uh Uh, Uh Uh So How Could I Be
Uh Uh, Uh Uh So
How Could I Be
Uh Uh, Uh Uh So How Could I Be
So Silly, So So Silly

Oh No You Broke My Heart Two
Feeling So Alone Here Without You
No Oh No
You Ain't Worth My Time
I Need Someone Who'll Treat Me Right
Cause Baby Love Ain't Suppose
To Hurt This Much
Love I Just Wanna Feel Your Touch
But, I Guess I Gotta Walk Away
Because There's Nothing Left For Me To Say

Oh I'm So Over It
I'm O-V-E-R-I-T-Z
Yeah
I'm So Over You
You Play Me For A Fool
Theres Nothin'left For Me To Do

Chorus:
'Cause I Gotta Pack My Bags
And Get Up Out Of Here
You Ain't Gonna Stop Me Baby
Look At What You Had My Love
Now I'm Walking Out The Door
I Ain't Gonna Love You No More
How Could I Be So Silly
So So Silly , So So Silly, So Silly
How Could I Be So Silly
So So Silly , So So Silly, So Silly
How Could I Be
Uh Uh, Uh Uh So How Could I Be
Uh Uh, Uh Uh So
How Could I Be
Uh Uh, Uh Uh So How Could I Be
So Silly, So So Silly

Babe!
Baby, I Trusted You
You Were The One That
I Could Come Runnin'to
But Now That We're Done
Said It
Wash Away The Tears And Swallow My Pride
Yeah Bet Your Feeling Lonely Tonight
Without Me By Your Side!
Silly, Silly

I Was So So
Silly, Silly

[Chorus:]
