'The days go by we argue all the time
I wanna make it right, cuz that was last night'
Babe we gon be no allright, no allright
You turned it I turned it we turned it all wrong
Theres no point in hold on >allright<
Im gonna move on, cut right?
Nthin btween us was ever right
So have we thought we could make things work
Like they ain't wrong, babe youre wrong

Since day one
It was always the same
Always fussin and fightin
For nothin or it all
Was laughin and creepin
Sth btween seemed so strong

I dont see a point in
Actin like its ok
But I dont even wana fight anymore
Cuz fightin was ours, it was OUR game
And seems we never knew each other
Nothing I thought you are I could now say is sure

I wanted to win
And if it was your turn it was ok
It wasn't you against whom I played
We played together
Like we could
Like we would and feel like lovers
I could count on you
To care, to be there
I could say its worth
The smallest little sth that we both share

You played, I played
We played it nearly every day
I thought it was our game
Even though I knew about the serious matters
We were discussin
It was our way to show we care
Cuz we both played our cool with a heart nowhere
No love to share
So fighting meant
You are worth passion, worth energy
Fighting meant
If you play it right today, you get a little maybe
If we play good we warm each other up
-But now is time to clean the flame, close the lights, give up

I played
Cuz somehow..i felt
Am strong have principles and all that
Independent, know what I got
You know where to put me which level
But we played a game
To each other with each other
We wanted nothing less than highscore
With love chosen to cheat on
Dont know if we both intended the same
Can't guess how much was real, how deep was the play'n

We played
And I let you in
You wanted and tried hard
To let it all begin
And I was too good for you to knock out easily
To good to moan out everythin you wanted from me
But somehow it wasn't only fun
-By time I got to know someone..

And what you were, when you were next to me
Seemed matching on someone touchable
Feelable for me
What you were on my sight
Was like a mirror I could see me through
Your eyes could beat in your vibe

We played
I know we messed it up, chosen the worst game to play on
Both with fear of nothing
More than the way feelin can make you get weak
Dont know if I believed you were too weak for me
To let it hurt, make me ever unhappy
Or if I thought you were more
Someone any pain I would be willin to pay for

But in the end, we messed it up
The gain was nothin our debts been love
And seems now my hearts stagnatin, always on repeat
Not knowin the rhythm havin lost its beat
My mind always with the same words
Move on move on move one
Your strong
But its wrong
Ive chosena be weak
Chosena feel
Now I feel strong only if you was with me
Yet not weak enough to stay
Yet too proud to cut it, interrupt it
Stop to make it go on, make it play

I thought it was all fun
And id never be jelous of you
Thought we were just playin
It was nothin real, nothin true

But now. I can't touch you anymore
Your scent could make me cry
Was that what you were lookin for..?
I ain't ask you, ainta say tell me why

Cuz we always played
From the very beginning
I started, sure that id be the part winning
And you know that.i would have
I had the choice
But I listened to my innerselfe'voice
Felt like 'give it a try' felt like 'it could be special'
Like 'Youre special in your way
The opposite within the same.'

And we got deeper every day
I got used to our time used to our game
I got used to smellya every day
Used to your voice sayin -the kind you doin- my name
But somehow it wasn't like routine, isnt that what bores me the most
We made it feel different
One day we found each other, one day we let each other stay lost

You was someone, not different than others
And I was always cold to you, how come you yet felt like we lovers
Haven't you felt anything dont tell me that
Yesterday I seen in your eyes that you do regret
And noone regrets, that ain't missin what he had
Noone turns the best so quickly to sth bad
If he wouldn't feel
You hate, dont tellme you dont hate me simetomes
So letme tellya, babe you musve loved me
Isnt that what hate defines..?

Nothingtheless. you opened up your body for other's lust
I dont know what was the bounty but I know whatyo lost
And I ain't ever touch you like I did befo
Senseful, loveful, always wantin to stay a little more
And I ain't ever feel like I did befo
You had me like wax in your fingers
Ain't have me at all anymore

You fingers touched others than mine
Your lips are marked different now I can tell you were lyin
You were EVERYTHING just yesterday, I felt youre all mine
Today is diffrent, seems you just lost someone
Dont know if it was worth to have others on top of you
First time im honest to myself. just the thought of it raises me, feelin a fire burnin in me
Youve chosen not to talk at all ere you did, thats what I gonna do now
Just lemme tell yo babe. see ill always stay ON TOP of your list
But never again by your sight, next to you

We always fighted, my heart stupidly chosen to be yours all over
And you been chosin to treat me like I mean nthin to ya
Once we played a game, these days gone now we ain't have that no more
I was you addict
Now I healed myself ain't ever been stronger
You thinkin by urself when you see me
Wasn't she mine, wasn't I hers, you missin, but we ain't ever be no longer
No longer anything
Your rulin, you gambled, now last round
We play, but
The games already over. gameovergameovergameover
