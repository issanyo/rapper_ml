[Verse 1]
Ooo, think I'm worried 'bout a rumor?
Whoa, I got a big crib, how many rooms here?
Aye, I forgot, I ain't seen the other side since I bought that motherfucker, wait
It's a shame, a lame's all you'll ever be
Man, a lame's all you'll ever be
Pain, came off of peanut butter jelly
Now you tellin' me all I get is jealousy?
Aye, happy birthday, you look surprised
I'm a gift, bitch, right before your eyes
I do this all the time, bitch, why you look surprised?
You look thirsty, my wrist look like Sprite
Happy birthday, today my day
I make a wish, I blow the cake
Ooo, you think I'm scared of a diss?
Aye, I think you're scared to get rich
Thursday to Thursday, I'm on my shift
I'm on my job like these hoes on my dick
Whoa, you start the day off by talkin' 'bout me
Everyday my birthday, you still ain't got me nothin'?

[Hook]
Yeah, I do this all the time
Aye, happy birthday, bitch, you look surprised
I told her, "Happy birthday, bitch, you look surprised"
I do this all the time, yeah, I do this all the time
And you gettin' crossed out if you ever cross the line
These bitches gon' strip and drop it down
And aksed them bitches, "Who poppin' now?"
Yeah, aksed them bitches who gon' stop me now

[Verse 2]
Ooo, think I'm worried 'bout a rumor?
Whoa, you still stayin' with a roomie
Aye, I forgot
You too busy talkin' 'bout it instead of gettin' to it, wait
It's a shame, a lame is all you'll ever be
Man, a lame is all you'll ever be
Game, got the whole set reppin' me
My name T-Raww, yeah, I'm raw like I said I'd be
Aye, happy birthday, you look surprised
I got my bread in the oven, watch it rise
I do this all time, why you look surprised?
I never hit the books but your boy bookin' flights, aye
Happy birthday, today my day
I make a wish, I blow the cake
Ooo, think I'm worried 'bout a scandal?
Aye, you put me on every chanel

[Bridge]
Gave you a sample, it's part two
Part Hennessy, part fuel
All I want for my birthday is more fire
More Twelve Juice, more designer
Young Halle Berry's in my theater room reclinin'
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, you know you can't deny it
I'm on a wave, I just left the islands
This a gangsta party, all the hoes invited, aye

[Hook]
Yeah, I do this all the time
Aye, happy birthday, bitch, you look surprised
I told her, "Happy birthday, bitch, you look surprised"
I do this all the time, yeah, I do this all the time
And you gettin' crossed out if you ever cross the line
These bitches gon' strip and drop it down
And aksed them bitches, "Who poppin' now?"
Yeah, aksed them bitches who gon' stop me now

[Outro]
Happy birthday, today my day
I make a wish, I blow the cake
Happy birthday, today my day
I make a wish, I blow the cake
Happy birthday, today my day
I make a wish, I blow the cake
Happy birthday, today my day
I make a wish, I blow the cake
