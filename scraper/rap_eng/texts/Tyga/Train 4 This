[Chorus]
And you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this (you know you came)
And you know who's thing this is, better say it then
You know you came for this (you know you came)
And you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this (you know you came)
And you know who I'm top five, champion level, I made your list
You know you came for this (you know you came)

[Verse 1]
And you know I brought so much, pleasure, pain came with it
Bit you know I'm made for this
And you know being this way is what made me rich, can't make things switch now
If I can make it hit, I can take a hit, yeah

[Chorus]
But you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this (you know you came)
And you know who's thing this is, better say it then
You know you came for this (you know you came)

[Verse 2]
You see me on Shade Room, fameolous, it's dangerous
You know how crazy fame can get, I know how crazy my baby get
But you didn't train for this, broke down and prayed for this
I'm havin' my way with this
In a big Jeep wagon, to the bank with this
And you didn't, yeah, train for this
You hopped on a train for this
You whip lanes and lane for this
'Cause you know who I'm top five, champion level, all day with this
And you can't stay away from this (and you can't stay away from this)

[Chorus]
And you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this (you know you came)
And you know who's thing this is, better say it then
You know you came for this, you know you can't resist
And you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this, you know, you know
And you know who I'm top five, champion level, I made your list
And you know you can't forget, and you know you can't forget

[Verse 3]
Now I know what you think
I know when you drink, you more aggressive with your expression
Let me know what you need (let me know what you need)
I think I know a recipe to think there's an extra me, yeah

[Chorus]
If you didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You on fire, I ignite it
I advise it, yeah, but you invited
I know you like it, it's like I'm psychic
I know you not my side bitch, no, you my sidekick, oh, oh
I know you Robin, I know, I know, I know you Robin
The way it fit (the way it fit)
Like God designed it (like God designed it)
The way I stick and move, stick and move, Mike Tyson, oh

[Chorus]
You didn't train for this, you can't fight it
You know you came for this, you know, you know
And you know who I'm top five, champion level, I made your list
You know you came for this  (came for this, came for this, came for this)
