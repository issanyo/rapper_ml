[Hook]
Never will I be the same
Since the money and cars came with the fame
We just party throwing parties cause I got a name
For them life is the same
But me, I will never be the same

[Verse 1]
As I hail Mary prayer, my way to the stage
Grab a hydro-oxygen, throw a little cool to face
Never afraid, lyrical grade A, MJ's win the game
Feeling like a mob wishing things now was like back in the day
Got a big break, seen a little cake
Now everybody and they momma wanna hate
Everybody and they momma wanna hate
But won't you wait
Sleeping on me, you won't wake
There's a killer looking in my eyes you will see thriller nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rolling down the window, on a new Benzo
Hollerin' at these bimbos, if my girl find out
No more bring your car out, for me
Shit I was only nineteen
Fuck that by the raise, spend this change on chains (for Last Kings)
More money, more money
Young money, your money
Others tell 'em fuck off
These new niggas all pause
What's a dog with a bark, to a tiger and a shark
And you wonder why I'm off the wall
Bitch, cause I'm bad, bad to the bone

[Hook]

You motherfuckers think you know me
You don't know shit, about me
See, cause I don't even know about me

[Verse 3]
High-rise standing on your suit and over-look Wiltshire
We don't gotta go into if what shit you ain't into, nigga
I be counting hunnids 'til I'm numb
Go to the bank cause it's fun
What you think cause I'm young saying coconut's to a drum that I'm dumb?
Tell that girl come get some
Two balls for the price of one
You can be my little soccer mom
When I'm done, take my kids, haha
Yeah you like that, yo keys in your lap
Don't get attached, close to the king
Had to get it tatted on my back

[Hook]

I will never be the same!
