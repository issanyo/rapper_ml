[Intro: Ben J]
Aye yo man
That shit lookin too TD
That mean Turned down
Lets get this shit active
You want to get active
I don’t really care lil' mama, what’s the deal?
You got a nice body
I’m hungry now, baby tell me how you feel

[Verse 1: Ben J]
Because if you ain’t there we can do foreplay
Girl let's kick it like soccer like Jorge
Have fun in this house, call it horseplay
She like a nigga with some cake like a birthday
Not a little scrawny little nigga doing four days
But don’t get me wrong, I’m skinny with a dope shape
This girl tell me skinny niggas got the bigger dicks
Cause I pulled out mine and I was big as shit
I never speak high league on you little kids
And when I say little, I’m talking big kids
Ya bitch let you talk shit you wear lipstick
Your girl call me ice cream cause that big stick
You wonder why I got a nickname and you didn’t
She said she you barely even hit it, I give her the business
Man you live for this chick, you feel for this chick
But when I come around her crib, I go in on this chick

[Hook: Ben J]
You want to get active, or want to get chill
I don’t really care Lil mama what’s the deal
You got a nice body, looking like a Meal
I’m hungry now baby tell me how you feel?

She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me
She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me
She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me
She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Shit bang bitch, active
Pigeon fly in the coupe, money in the mattress
Can’t fuck this chick, cause she crazy like my last bitch
Might let you get a taste, Go on tell your girlfriend
So icky wet, really really she a fan
I really want to put her on, but it’s no hands
Overnight celebrity off the slow jam
Bad to the bone, bone baby you want it
So famished, eat it if its Spanish
No bandana, bang my hammer
Girls getting gooey and the Gucci all wow
Carrera and Louie fuck you in your all gown
Owww, Ayyy, pass on to Ben J
In the rose red mirror, she a devil with a waist
Last King Pharaoh , motherfucker in the game
These niggas ain't thorough throw it up in your face, Ayee

[Hook: Ben J]
You want to get active, or want to get chill
I don’t really care Lil mama what’s the deal
You got a nice body, looking like a Meal
I’m hungry now baby tell me how you feel?

She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me
She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me
She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me
She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me

[Verse 3: Legacy]
Woah she got to watch it if she skeet on me
I got that underrated dick cause she sleep on me
I close the curtains she go nuts, no common sense
She going German on the blowjobs like "Khhh" and shit
If you gotta go, we can do it in your car
She said my pipe is meaner then the comments on WorldStar
Of course I’m wearing latex, but first I made her taste it
I went down and did the same shit, make the kitty purr like trey pens
My mouth be getting all riddle on her clit real tongue licking
Tony, I’m a pharaoh on the head, “Well Done” get it
I made it rain, bitch, now get a hommie something
She said her name was Paris, and this that Dirty Money!
Please don’t be without a sleeve
'Cause you might get burned like Cleveland 23
Rule blind scissors to the eye, blind sight bastard
YM, 100, West Side, Active

She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me
She trying to run from me, then she brought it back to me
