I mean I've been doing some thinking you know
And we only teenagers but I do love you
But I think we gotta move on
Don't cry though
Listen this is teenage love baby

When I'm alone all I'm thinking about is my girl
You smile your pretty face' and them light brown curls
At first I was playing and saying cause love is a horrible thing
The way straight to it didn't hesitate
Wit any these Tyga my friends call me fly than yah
X-men head is flying
Being honest I am more than what you can find in cereal boxes
Be my goddess higher in this world
I could take your body
Probably being a man is not an option its a hobby
So you holding my hand is what other girls is watching
Picks up your prints in your locker
Put this lip gloss on and get the haters poppin lil mamma

[Chorus]
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again

You call up the studio
I said about another hour
But you refused to hear it, saying baby do you miss me
But my intentions were to play this song when I visit you
Screaming up conversations everybodys trying to listen
But we only young and infacuated, sprung, in lust
I think I'm all the above two teenagers in love
I gave up them girls you gave up the club
I gave you everything you wanted just because
I was waiting for cupid to come shooting arrows through my heart
Now you wanna be apart
Watcha mean you finished
We only at the start and to leave when it girl we come oh so far

[Chorus]
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again

Listen up pivit its to risky
I don't get it
I'm feeling dizzy
The rooms spinning
You've got to be kidding
My teenages misses, you leave now my life is ended, my life is ended

Teenage love its a teenage love [2x]
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Its a teenage love love love love [3x]
Don't don't don't hurt me again

[Chorus]
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again

Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
