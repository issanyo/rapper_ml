[Hook-Quez +  Tyga]
I said I like the way she take it down low
She put her hands on her knees and grind slow
She say she working but she get off 'round 4
I let her hit the weed, baby let yo mind go
Down low down low
I like it when she take it down low, down low
Real strippers only do it down low, down low
Baby take it off down low, down low
Then drop it to the floor

[Verse 1 - Strap da Fool]
You wanna fuck with her you gotta bring yo A game
My portna tried to fuck her, she told him the same thang
She work at Magic City all about her change mane
She like that freaky shit so we goin do a train mane
She dancin' like she ain't never danced, and I ain't finna stop her
She get it from her momma, her momma a pussy popper

Family reunion at aunties and I'm servin all for dinner

Big titty hanging
Same ol' stripper pop that pussy on my table

Some Nuvo and some Rose
Young Money in this bitch go and tell the DJ
Aw, I swear she hit that pole like a field goal
And I just kicked that sex game like a nympho
She fucking underrated, I fuck her till she fainted
One night like in Vegas, I make that bitch look famous
Uh, so let yo hair down, ready to roll
Pick you up around 4, and your nigga ain't gotta know
We creeping around here we goin' hit that corner store
Let me get that magnum on that ho
I'm a call her what she want, thats my side bitch (my side bitch)
Always play the game

I take her to my kingdom, on that king mattress she lay
I'm a Last King, put my jewels on your face

I asked her what her name?
She said “boy I though you knew it”
Well it must've slipped mind
But you look willing and able
And you look like a stallion Im a add you to my stable
She take it to the floor she ain't coming up for air
Cause she like it down low while she shakes her derrière

[Verse 4-Ali]
I said I like it when she dropping it low
I told her hit me up as soon as she's ready to go
Then she said around 4, baby just let me know
You keep on staring at me like yo ass is ready to go
Lets go shit, but that ain't it, no
That ain't all, as soon as we hit the crib
1st thing she did was drop her drawers
And yea she very pretty, met her at magic city
