[Intro]
Yeah, King Bert, Sup
Kill em' in the dirt

[Verse 1: King Bert]
I'm Chilling with the homies
Smoking weed, Drinking beer
I don't think that I make it more clear
Im feelin right
Feelin tight
Getting drunk (drunk)
Ima fuck a bitch tonight
Maybe ill fuck this bitch (i dont know)
Or her over there
I dont give a shit
As long as she's got hair
But only on her head and none down below
I dont want her lookin like no kinda fellow
I ain't gay
I dont swing like that
If anyone say that I do
I'll hit em' with a bat
Straight to the dome, ill kill you (yeah)
Now your dead and gone

[Hook 1: King Bert]
Im chillen
With the homies
Getting dummied, yeah

Money
No money at all

[Verse 2: King Bert]
Im so damn broke (HA!)
Its pretty funny
When I get paid
I spend all my money
I spend it on my mama
Nope, that a lie
I spend it on me
Cause im fuckin fly
If you dont believe look at my shoes
They're dirty and old man
Just like your mama too
I tore up that clitorus
I fucked that hoe
It's like I said, she's dirty and old
It was fuckin gross, I dont know why I did it
It was a fucking chore man, shit
Yo, i did it for community service and more

[Verse 3: Tyga]
It's that young beasty nigga
Brrr-hah stick em
It's still no fitteds, Dupont finish
Courtside tickets, a Laker in my city
Purple like Grimace
Roof pop like titties
Pound sign - sit your ass down, bitch, I'm busy
I'm balling like a bitch - all-blue Ken Griffies
Use the chicken rotisserie, squeeze the ? to your lemon
Everything I do new, nigga, cut the red ribbon
Give me space to the left
Leave your face indented
There's too many women, why these niggas out there staring?
T-Raw Mclaren, boy flayer than a parrot
Me and that money got a merit
I was the first to pop her cherry

[Hook 3: Tyga]
Now it's big living, fast cars, model women
Penthouse, hella-chains - why you tripping?

[Outro]
Money & Liquor
Money & Liquor
Money & Liquor
