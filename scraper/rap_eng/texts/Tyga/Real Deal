[Spoken Intro]
[Verse 1]
Looking at the clock it's about that time
Can I introduce myself?
I been watching you from far,and it's been too long, can I have this song
I just get so mesmerized when you up and against that pole
I just wanna take you home
Who are they to criticize
How you decide to make your money
I will spend every dime on you baby, take it from me
Since I saw you in the corner
Had to let you know I want ya
All these bitches say you bougie
Didn't stop me from approaching
I don't give a fuck, what your reputation is
I just won't repeat this night and do it all over again
These are the thoughts in my mind
Hope you don't think I'm crazy
Just don't ever try to play me
These are rules aI'm engaging
I sit back in the back and wait for the perfect time
Seems you don't have the time
Wish I could re-reverse the time
Pretty little thang, give me love out of a sippy cup
Sit me up, finish up, zip it up, this is lust

[Hook]
Walk up in this bitch said I need that (need that)
Shawty caught my eyes said I need that (need that)
Let me get a feel, man I hope it feel real
I’m the fuckin' real deal, bend over bitch you know the drill
Walk up in this bitch said I need that (need that)
Shawty caught my eyes said I need that (need that)
Let me get a feel, man I hope it feel real
I’m the fuckin' real deal, bend over bitch you know the drill

[Verse 2]
Pretty pussy popping put your back into that, hand-stands
Am about to have a heart attack, let me handle that
Can we go somewhere private, show me for a private dance
You been working way too hard, I just think you need a man
I can be your fucking man, we can fuck and do some things
I can make the headboard bang, let me make your clit sing
I'm not tryna be rude
I just wanna see your birthday suit, if it's cool with you
Let me taste, taste your best friend too
Knew you were such a super freak
I could only daydream about it, now it's all reality
I pretend she was you when you make a squirt scene
Am I choking you too hard?
Hope nobody hears you scream
Am a little crazy when it comes to you baby
We can live together, you're my midnight fantasy
I won't let them hurt you
I be right back to the ATM
These are the thought in my conscious can you hear them? (hear them)

[Bridge]
Don't stop, keep dirty dancing (dancing)
I like it when you turn around dancing (dancing)
Let me put my hand on it baby keep dancing (dancing)
Don't stop baby keep on dirty dancing
Don't stop, keep dirty dancing (dancing)
I like it when you turn around dancing (dancing)
Let me put my hand on it baby keep dancing
Don't stop baby keep on dirty dancing
