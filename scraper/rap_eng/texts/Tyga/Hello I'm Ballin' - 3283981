[Intro]
I spent 1.8 million of my hard earned money
To buy this motherfucking car, that I had heard about called the Bugatti

Okay, my boujee bitch saw she wanna [?]
And my college bitch need a new apartment
Make them both cum together and say it's all in
(Rawest nigga alive)
Hello Bitch I'm ballin

Hello bitch, I'm ballin and I'm a jet lagged
Ah, shopping in Japan we don't price check
Ah, See me for Channel, Dior, Sunglass
Ah, Leather quilt, sand Bugatti sand man
Don't bother me, I'm waking up from a zen
T-take two girls, make 'em best friend

This T-Raww, like let's get acquainted
She made the ShadeRoom, she think she famous
Tattoos on the body, cocaine is a hobby
Don't be so obvious, nigga, record and watch
And sell it make it profit
Tryna slow up the progress
Light up, burn let it process
I yes, interior chopped, the turblance, swervin'
Medallion diamond iced the syrupin', sir yes
Paid cash advance (cash advance)
Rubs hands, but no Birdman

Okay, my boujee bitch saw she wanna [?]
And my college bitch need a new apartment
Make them both cum together and say it's all in
(Rawest nigga alive)
Hello Bitch I'm ballin

Boujee bitch saw she wanna [?]
And my college chick need a new apartment
Make them both cum together and say it's all in
(Rawest nigga alive)
Hello Bitch I'm ballin
