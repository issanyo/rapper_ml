[Intro]
Hit the bitch
I know you feel special

[Verse 1]
Look me in the eyes, I ain't ever lie
Real killa bees, Wu-Tang 'bout this West Side
Dominate, make a bitch woosah, head nod
Never been fake, gettin' pussy on the red dot
Red dots, pointin' at the bullseye
Lookin' at moi, it's a thin line
Got Bobby Brown for a widow, Superman high
Who gon' contest I? Light up the Jedi
Came with the booty and some caine, purple on the dank
Drippin' my new paint, days, 50 days
Yes I'll be late, I need dollars andale-le-le
Andale, all white, Lana Del Rey
Video games, fuckin', my life, gotta love it
Nothin' above it
Angels and Rolex, a ho fast in public
I don't shop at Publix
Pussy with chopsticks, I dug it, I dug it
I'm sober until 10
If she open, I lock it and post bail
I'ma need the helipad when I land
If it's not there, we back to the crib
That Maybach my limo
So you wanna bang, my nigga?
Got a piece that'll bang, my nigga
Let's bang, my nigga
When I finish, take all your bitches
Now she tellin' me all your business

[Hook]
I hit the bitch with the wham
Wham, wham
Pose like that, just like that
Just like that
That bitch give me wham
Wham, wham
Tattooed that, bring that shit
Pose like that
That bitch give me wham

[Verse 2]
Wham, fuck up the bed
Hole in her neck from the fangs
Pressure and pain, adjust the brains
Rove to the Lamb', my engine the same
Asylum restrained, this ain't for playin'
Put on the mask, now I'm Zoro on the dash
They don't make 'em like this anymore, goddamn
I'm pullin' up, you would think my first name Dan
Niggas like damn, load up the pain, no blanks
Got hate, do a stain, pallbearer liftin' dead weight
How much you weigh?
On a scale... ...to 98
Keep it one hundred with me like sand on the beach
Need a freak of the week
That's her sister Anise, keep it G
On some real shit, niggas can't fuck with me
They can't fuck with me
Wham, wham, more than a man
Who got the keys to the Lamb'
Pussy and cash, hundreds and ass
Pulled out my stash, niggas got mad
Mad, damn, drunk when I land
Fresh off the plan, T-Raw the ram, ram
Look me in the eyes, I ain't ever lie

[Hook]
I hit the bitch with the wham
Wham, wham
Pose like that, just like that
Just like that
That bitch give me wham
Wham, wham
Tattooed that, bring that shit
Pose like that
That bitch give me wham
Wham, wham
Pose like that, just like that
Just like that
That bitch give me wham
Wham, wham
Tattooed that, bring that shit
Pose like that
That bitch give me wham

[Outro]
(Wham)
You now listenin' to the sounds of T-Y-G, if you don't like what you hear, sit back and shut the fuck up. Oh yeah, and have a nice day
