[Verse 1: Tyga]
Yeah, rumor has it that I'm armed
Somebody should have told them
When the cash starts flowing and the hands start reaching
Tsst, you read the contract your man ain't breaching
Uh, and rumor has it
The jeweler wants his money
But I'm out here rocking all my chains, real chunky, real comfy
And rumor has it when I hit the club hoes go dummy
And rumor has it, I'm doing magic
David Blaine, diamonds in the hat trick
Rumor has it, thought you had it
How is that true when I have it? Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Look at all these rumors, oh
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away, oh
(Can't see the time in the Rollie face)
From all these rumors
I can't take it no more (take it no more)
My best friend said there’s a story out now
'Bout me and the girl next door
Look at all these rumors
Look at all these rumors

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, rumor has it, I'm a hazard
Don't give me no Hennessy, I might make some enemies
And rumor has it, I'm going broke, it's all smoke and mirrors
What happens when you smoke huh?
You start to see shit, start to believe shit
Can't read me, 'cause you believe what you read bitch
And rumor has it I need you for me to make it happen
You believe that shit, you really smoking crack then
Came up from a small room packed in
Used to drink out the tap, now I'm tapped in
And rumor has it I'ma die rich
Yeah, me and all my stacks in my casket, cramped in
Rumor has it there's a rumor 'bout me
They don't know what to do about me
And rumor has it there's a rumor 'bout you
You a bitch ass nigga and I know it's true, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Look at all these rumors, oh
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away, oh
(Can't see the time in the Rollie face)
From all these rumors
I can't take it no more (take it no more)
My best friend said there’s a story out now
'Bout me and the girl next door
Look at all these rumors, look at all these rumors, oh, woah
Look at all these rumors, oh

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Rumor has it that a nigga brazy
If you was me then you would do the same thing
And I know everybody gon' attack me
Stop acting like these niggas like me
And I done fucked around and had a baby
I was running 'round pussy crazy
All these rumors, spreading like
You know I

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Look at all these rumors, oh
Surrounding me every day, yeah, yeah
I just need some time (time)
Some time to get away, oh (all these rumors)
From all these rumors
I can't take it no more (I can't, take it no more, oh)
My best friend said there’s a story out now
'Bout me and the girl next door (ooh)
Look at all these rumors, oh
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away, oh
(Can't see the time in the Rollie face)
From all these rumors
I can't take it no more (take it no more)
My best friend said there’s a story out now
'Bout me and the girl next door
Look at all these rumors
Look at all these rumors
