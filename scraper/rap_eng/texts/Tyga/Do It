[Intro]

Whaaaat

[Verse 1: Problem]
Turn up, money burn up, I do it daily
Adidas and a beeper, I'm from the 80's
Slap my mama before I let you marks play me
You boyfriend mad cus' a nigga ain't me
For real though, yea for real though
Racks before raps, yea I got that real doe
Wiz keep fire so I smoke that kill doe
Keep it one double O, got that hundred bill flow
Yea it's me though, Problem, chachi, pick a name ho
Girlfriend straight, better have her on a rainbow
By the time I'm done with her
Ain't never had a fly nigga put his tongue in her, and twist it

[Hook: Problem]
Hell yea I got all these girls, but my main objective get dough

If I want her, I can have her, I just trade for like a Buick, OK
Watch a nigga do it
She got good brain, but that ass stupid

I don't play like pacman, man I'm turnt the fuck up in here
Don't mind me, I'mma just drunk nigga turnt up, trynna get fucked up
With a little bitch, nigga I'm rich
And I ain't gonna lie, just trust me
And you ain't gotta ask your girl, ho fuck me
And yea I'm ready for it, and I know you are too
Fool with that brain, yea I know it all too
Put it in your mouth like where we go with our food
And when you done do the same to my crew

Getting high, showing off in the hood on some young shit
Brought my show often in the streets, like a bum bitch
Cus' we fucked, never ever catch me on some bum shit
