[Verse 1: Drake]
Ugh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about are talkin' blunt and stayin' blunted
Pretty women are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all just disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You seem to flee to all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rolling and their mood change
Like a muthafucka
New flow, I got a dozen of em
I don't trust you, you're an undercover
I could probably make some stepsisters fuck each other, whew
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What? Tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Hook: Mally Mall] x2
Whatcha say huh?
Whatcha say huh?
Whatcha say huh?
Real niggas all day, all day what

[Verse 2: Kid Heat]
Whew, this the king from under
They say to bet against the odds but I like even numbers
The kid, I'm all up at the cribbo, fuckin' on a bad bitch
Ass like a hippo, leavin' bitches crippled
Read the bitch MO, play it like a demo
Trickin' when ya got it really is a n-o
But I'm just really stickin' how I feel right now huh
Niggas can't stand real right now, huh?
Can't see me, invisible
Make ya bitch need the kid, feinin' like it's critical
Rappers try to see me, feelin' so invisible
Niggas wanna be me, bout to get it physical, ain't stoppin'
Clock stop it, pop lock it
Stock option, cock block it, Glock cock it
To take a shot, girl your genitals
Got me goin' in with only 60 minute intervals
You know you bad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Oh, it's the 8th wonder
Wonder how I keep comin' with the Bay number
Yeah, I play the money, I play it off cause you ain't had a lot
She gon' say I'm cocky, told her "You know that I get that a lot"
Codeine, like a night game
The rave cocaine came with a scale mane
Trynna be the only one, that's a long race
I'll call you Billie Jean, but what would Mike say?
In L.A, in L.A, in L.A (in L.A)
We in the mansion, all day
MIA, all the girls with it
Late night, they say "Don't stop, get it, get it"
8 mil' for the new home
See the gold car, she like Raw home
No shades I'll bring it to ya face nigga
Like whatcha say, whatcha say, nigga

[Hook]
