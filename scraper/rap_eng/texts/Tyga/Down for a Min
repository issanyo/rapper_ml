[Intro]
Oh, are you fucking me, oh

[Hook 1]
My nigga, I've been down for a minute
And I've been tryna make my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
My way home, my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
And I've been tryna make my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
My way home, my way home (home)
I've been rollin' with 'em hitters
And I didn't got way, way, way strong
And niggas wanna rob me, she wanna rob me
But I be on my way home

[Verse 1]
And I be ridin' with her, I rhyme with her
I take her where homie can't go
And I be state to state with her, stay with her
And niggas actin' like they don't know
But baby watchin' all that shit though
Well when you get the fame, that's how things goes
And everybody talk that talk though
But when the money talks, we can talk more

[Hook 2]
You know I've been down for a minute
And I've been tryna make my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
My way home, my way home (home)
I've been down with 'em hitters
And I didn't got way, way, way strong
And niggas wanna rob you, she wanna rob you
But I be on my way home

[Verse 2]
You know I be on the map and I be on an app
I swear to god I'm all of that, I'm on to you
And what you want, ain't  no comin' back, ain't no comin' back
I swear to God I ain't comin' back, don't leave with you
You know it's all love, heart attack, heart attack
I told the money where my heart at, no comin' back, shit
And niggas take that money ooh, no, shit
Niggas take that money ooh (I know I did)
And now I'm formed with no assist
Spend the gain with my main chick
Comin' down in that lane switch
Stuntin' now on these lame niggas
What the fuck ya name is, don't care what ya name is
Nooo, I don't
And I be on a same Glock with the same Glock
I ain't the same rock, I ain't the same now and she knows

[Hook 3]
You know I've been down for a minute
And I've been tryna make my way home
You know I've been down for a minute
My way home, my way home (home)
I've been rollin' with 'em hitters
And I didn't got way, way, way strong
And niggas wanna rob me, she wanna rob me
But I be on my way home

[Verse 3]
And I be, goddamn, rumours everyday
Got a faint on me now when you fade away
Tell me, is you down from him, you down from me
Cuz' I don't trust that, I'm over that, I'm done with that
I'm like fuck that, I love you and fuck that, I need you
I took you 'round the globe and back
Matter fact, to Rome and back, I could tell you need that

[Hook 4]
Cause baby, you've been down for a minute
And you've been tryna make your way home
Baby, you've been down for a minute
Your way home, your way home (home)
You've been rollin' with 'em hitters
And you didn't got way, way, way strong
And now they wanna rob you, she wanna rob me
But we be on our way home

Haaaaahh

[Outro]
Whenever you get lost
Just remember I will always be there to guide you
Listen to the sound of my voice
My, my love will always be your light
Darkness will always follow the brightest star
(the brightest star)
Our dreams are what make us who we are
The world's yours, Tyga
