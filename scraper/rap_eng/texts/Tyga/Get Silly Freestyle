[Tyga]
(Intro)
Hahaha Yeeeah
Umm, I presume you already know what this is
A Young Money, G.E.D, Decaydance Production
Well, I didn't make the beat
But I'm gone make the beat
I'mma lose all my knowledge since preschool and get silly

[Verse]
My advance check got the bank teller depressed
My publishing check made the IRS check
My fucking alias like who the fuck is this
Student who didn't go to college but forever set
Fuck a Standford 9 test, a Standford 9 test?
What the fuck is that when you steady got stacks on deck
I spazz wit the tats, California on my neck
Gold shapes swing of the center of my chest
I don't trip on these chicks, tell em there n-n-n-nothin
To a man getting rich with a motion picture budget
Flying motion with no potion, sober, I dearly does it
I never went to class studying cash was my subject
I love it, how does it feel to pay the bills before your mother
Bread like wonder, make her wonder why they flourish
For little human thunder, I explain thoroughly to her
Easily they download and discover like researchers
Research the hard workers, I work hard for the skill murder
Still hunger, you didn't hear it when I deliver
Like fast food burgers, in and out burger
In and out yo sis brother
My black brothers stop hatin it ain't worth it
Like penny savers, ya'll niggas ain't bout nothin
Like dry humpin, before that shit I was the shit
Call it predumpin, eat dumplins, never done it
I'm too youngin like put putin
I get paid off clubs, tiger woods shit tyga good
Understood before they knew me thirty thou crowds
Like stood, understand couple of years I will
Be the fucking man
