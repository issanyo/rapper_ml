[Verse 1]
Looking at the ceiling, thinking why I treat you bad
Ain't no worser feeling than knowing I did it for the laughs
Arguing all I was doing, accusing you -- my bad
Said let's take some time, never mind, rewind..

Looking at the ceiling, thinking why I treat you bad
Ain't no worser feeling than knowing I did it for the laughs
Arguing all I was doing, accusing you -- my bad
Said let's take some time, never mind, just playing with your mind
I always thought, play dumb and let the other one love
Why get caught up in a web of trust?
Only love for fun, I'm too young, I thought
All I wanted was a thanks, them Louboutins I bought
But it ain't your fault
Heaven knows you deserve it all
You sent letters to my heart, but I burnt them all
The Bible says before you run, gotta learn to crawl
But I don't wanna waste time if we ain't involved

[Hook]
Aw Aww
We been through it all
I know I broke your heart once before
But I'm done
Aw aww awww
Tell me what's wrong
I know I never listen, but just listen to this song
Aww man
I promise we gon do it til the sun come down
I swear it's going down
I promise we gon do it til the sun come out
Fuck if they don't do it, we gon do it all

[Verse 2]
Now the ceiling fan spinning -- getting dizzy, man
Wondering who she with, maybe should I call?
Don't be desperate, man
This ain't no tag-you're-it, hide-and-seek shit
Reality just kicked in, I lost one and now she's winning
Found another nigga she did
Says he treat her like a queen, but she probably control him
Fuck that, I gotta get her back to where we started
Start over again, this time her heart's in
Honestly, leave us, leave us, let's just talk about it
I know before I wasn't much of a man about it
But this time I realize I can't live without you
Believe when I say it's true
I love you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Love make you do it all
Going up and down like a see-saw
Can't be a player forever, dog
It feels so good, but I know it's wrong
Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on
Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on
Motherfucker, drink what I'm sipping on
A bottle of love, tell me if it's too strong

[Hook]
