[Intro]
Well, well done
Finish him

[Verse 1]
Treat my dick like a dog bitch, fetch
I put it down your throat
Then I bust it on your neck
T-killer I’m a mess, Homer Simpson in the flesh
Yeah I’m doper then syringe
Fuck your bitch and all her friends
Make amends for all my sins I ain’t trippin on a bitch
I’m a bull give me wings
Too many tats on my skin
You know my rank nigga
If you speaking, come proper
Hit you with a shot like boom shaka laka
Knock your ass to your feet like too much vodka
I’m hotter than a two dollar pistol from a Rasta
Yeah they call me Tyga with a heart of Mufasa
Nigga I ain’t lying
Hard to find like a fossil
I’ll be outta here king shit like Cairo
Asian nigga kick you in the face Tae Bo
I’m rising with the heat on these niggas like pyro
I’m just freestyling, a nigga young and wilding
Lord I done suffered through too many years
And we done shed so many tears
Lost many peers no memories
Just misery killing all my enemies
Fuck her til she can’t see
Fuck until we can’t breath
Knock knock who there, deez nuts in your face
Bitch I’m eating: get a plate
All my niggas do the same, most my homies Hoover Gang
Larry Hoover, Lawrence Taylor, giant Glocks
Patch your eye like a Raider
Too many bitches call it pussy mania
Niggas tryna borrow swag, I don’t do favors
Pac shit middle finger
Finger fuck whoever hating
I’m the shit ya’ll niggas constipated
Fuck your bitch it's easy, even to a caveman
I’m good, Meagan
Make it rain til the roof cave in
85 laker, high rise, purple lasers
Marc Jacobs famous like the Mona Lisa
No patients leave her in the lobby waiting
Vacation, nigga I ain’t talking Vegas
