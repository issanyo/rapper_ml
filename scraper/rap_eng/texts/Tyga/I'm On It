[Chorus: Tyga]
I’m on it, I’m on it
I’m on it, I’m on it
If we talkin’ bout money bitch

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Snap back, chin up, gold chain nigga
Stripes no Tigger, Tyga bitches
Hundred proof liquor, live no liver
There's hoes in this muthafucka straight trippin'
A nigga no different, so we hold the heat though
Smash on the bitch, brains lookin' like meatloaf
The ho know me close she lyin', Leos
Pedigree and swag is so cold, zero
Hop in Medino, oops I meant Medina
Life is a bitch better know how to treat her
I don’t get in between, my goal be to win
Young Money Heisman, rookies of the year, bitch

[Chorus: Tyga]
I’m on it, I’m on it
I’m on it, I’m on it
If we talkin’ bout money bitch

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Raise hell boy, hell yeah I'm hot - hello
Boy yellow but my bitch black from the ghetto
Put the flow in a pot, watch the shit sizzle
You grillin' me, better breakfast McGriddle
I ain’t finna slow down, keep runnin' your mouth
I’m runnin' the real estate, party in the fuckin' house
My niggas is loud in the lobby they can’t turn us down
Have a drink, drink, drink some Coke and a smile
No clown, but I hit the party then I’m out
I run town all day, twenty-four miles
One fifty on the dash, can’t even count
Keep fuckin' bitch, ain’t shit to talk about

[Chorus: Tyga]
I’m on it, I’m on it
I’m on it, I’m on it
If we talkin’ bout money bitch

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Be-best rapper, C.E.O
Fine as wine flow, Pinot Grigio
Niggas can't fuck with me
Neither bitches, neither hoes
Life is a motherfucking gamble, Peter Rose
Momma taught me well, kush and the L
Paper everywhere like books just fell
More money to make, more pussy to smell
Like yeah I'mma a Libra, life or death on a scale
New Orleans nigga with my dick up in my right hand
Young Money nigga, money longer then a lifespan
Still go to sleep with my Bible on my nightstand
Flyer then a bitch and you ain’t even got your flight plan
I’m on it, I’m on it
Tunechi, yea, soo woo
Soo woo, trill, hahahaha, yeaaa
