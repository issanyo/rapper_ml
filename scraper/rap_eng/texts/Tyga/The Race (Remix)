[Verse 1: Tay-K]
I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys deep? Well let's get to subtractin'
Smith and Wesson made my .9 with sub-compaction

Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase

Pop a nigga then I go out my way
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our ...

[Verse 2: Tyga]
(Rawwest Nigga Alive)
Fuck the [?], little gram by the case
New Bugatti, who wanna race
Black Barbie, make her come to the base
Pink pussy, pink slips in my safe
(Yeah) You switched your rollie face, heard it was fake
Uh, I put stones in my goyard foretaste
(Yeah) No receipts, the feds want that case
Cash Money, I still need that from baby (Millions)
I just spent 80k on little baby (Ooh)
I just bought out my deal now I'm Swayze
Uh, tours in Tokyo my chains is on eagle
In Dubai, where weed puff illegal
New bitch, they think it's the sequel
Wolfgang, cook up like Lil B do
Uh, Moo Sho, [?]
Seven years later, dinner plates is still Versace
When I'm in Saint Martin, say the floor cold like Tommy
Palace with shawties and I work like [?]
Wrist rocky, I got all the clout
Niggas, watch me
Cause they bitch watching
Top models top me, top rappers follow
I'm in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil getting swallowed

[Outro: Tyga]
Fuck that [?], little gram by the case
New Bugatti, young sold the wraith
Black Barbie, make her come to the base
Pink pussy, pink slips in my safe
(Yeah) You switched your rollie face, heard it was fake
Uh, I put stones in my goyard foretaste
Uh, no receipts, the feds want that case
Cash Money, I still need that from baby (Yeah)
