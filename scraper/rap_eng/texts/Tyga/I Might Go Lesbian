[Intro: Manika (Tyga)]
I'm so damn sick of men
(Ah, young T-Raww, ah)

[Verse 1: Manika]
Darkness on the floor
Heartbroken, yeah it hit me
How many times have been through this already?
He reels me, I take the bait
Now I'm hooked
I already know my fate
Next comes the pain
Damn did I really fall for that again?
It's like men
All they ever do is pretend
That they love you
But they just fucking with your mind
And another chick at the same time
Damn, I'm so sick of men
I might go lesbian

[Hook: Manika]
Heartbreaking as fast as they can
I'm so damn sick of men
I might go le-e-e-e-esbian
I might go le-e-e-e-esbian

[Verse 2: Tyga]
So you sick of men? I got the Theraflu
I got the club jumping, I brought a parachute
Say no to drugs, but my pinkie ring's daring you
Fuck you like a rabbit, yeah, the rings ten carats boo
I'm the last male, he was just preparing you
I'm a one-of-one, who you gonna compare me to?
I'm a feature film, he a preview
Now you like girls? Me too
Diamonds and furs? Me too
Wanna take over the world? Me too
Get with them girls, I'm your only one
Young T-Raww, tryna hit a hole-in-one

[Hook: Manika]
Heartbreaking as fast as they can
I'm so damn sick of men
I might go le-e-e-e-esbian
I might go le-e-e-e-esbian

[Verse 3: Manika (Tyga)]
Yeah, maybe I should give us a ladies a try
Cause we always understand and we never make us cry
Yeah, maybe I should give us a ladies a try
Cause we're everything not, that I hate in a guy
Every time I'm heartbroken, who's there for me?
(My girls)
And every time I need a friend, who's there for me?
(My ladies)
Plus we got soft skin, red lips, perfect hair, the clothes we wear
Just started with a kiss, damn I think I could go for this
Damn, I mean I think, I could really like go for this, go for this

[Bridge: Tyga (Manika)]
So you sick of men? (Yeah)
Now you like girls? Me too
(I might go, oh, oh)
I'm the last male
I'm your only one
(I might go lesbian)

[Hook: Manika]
Heartbreaking as fast as they can
(They be so heartbreaking)
I'm so damn sick of men
I might go le-e-e-e-esbian
(I might go lesbian)
I might go le-e-e-e-esbian
Heartbreaking as fast as they can
(Oh yeah)
I'm so damn sick of men
I might go le-e-e-e-esbian
(I, I, I might go lesbian)
I might go le-e-e-e-esbian
