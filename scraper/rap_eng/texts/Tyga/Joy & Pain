Tyga:
Uhh for you I’m putting up a fight
And it’s crazy how I’m thinking ‘bout you all the time
Tat my name on you, show me that you really mine
Stevie Wonder by how yet they say that love is blind
But I see it all, & I don’t see no flaws
She walk, dress, like a fashion show I just applaud
Got problems, I be the shoulder to lean on
Nobody perfect, but you a angel with wings on
Chanel Iman smile brighter than neon, star
Like no other you team, you the only one
I dreamed of
May be you one day, today a storm come
Smiley face with a tongue haha

Chris Richardson:
Hey, just wanna say hey
Don’t mean to be rude
But, don’t mean to think about you all night long
If it’s fly, if it’s all I sly
Just take the good times with the sorrow
Promise you’ll be back tomorrow

(Hook)
Can you smile for me, show those pretty teeth
Blow my mind again, if you miss me
You can cry away, toss my heart again
Let me feel your pain
Even if it's somewhere in between Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Even if it’s somewhere in between Joy & Pain

Lets talk about us
Cause even if we fuss so fight
Don't mama, I can't get enough
Tell me where you are, and where you’ve been
All I want is you to tell me "I'm happy again"

Can you smile for me, show those pretty teeth
Blow my mind again, if you miss me
You can cry away, toss my heart again
Let me feel your pain
Even if it's somewhere in between Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Even if it’s somewhere in between Joy & Pain

Even if it’s somewhere, I swear I'll get there
Tears are going out, I can see you smiling again
Somewhere between pain, & Joy gave us everything
Put the smile I've ever seen on you

Can you smile for me, show those pretty teeth
Blow my mind again, if you miss me
You can cry away, toss my heart again
Let me feel your pain
Even if it's somewhere in between Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Joy & Pain
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Even if it’s somewhere in between Joy & Pain
