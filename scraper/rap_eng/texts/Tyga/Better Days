[Verse 1: Tyga]
Rollin' with my "yeah so?" hat to the back
Oh, you ain't heard 'round town? Young nigga strapped
Well Mike, if you lose your life it's no coming back
I've seen lots of lies fake smiles behind my back
Bitch check your chitter-chat
Bruise blues and black
Never trust a loud-mouth, mama taught me that
Don't live the lifestyle, son, if you can't pay for that
But shit you got to spend the money to get money back
And I hurry to the cash, pictures snap
Sirens flash, fuck an officer with a badge
Let's see your license motherfucker that I don't have
Not even half of these niggas have had half of what I had
But I still wish that

[Hook]
If I can leave this place, and just get away
I want to get away (get away)
But I know I see better days
Better days
Better days

[Verse 2: Tyga]
After last weekend, I heard some nigga speaking
About some Tyga beef shit
Like oh, when I see him
I live a landslide occur when deers run
By in herds, bitches tweakin'
Forgetting the seasons
Lames not in my lane
Got heat for little Heathens
I rise over them like Christ in A.D
It's a prayer visual as I murder the spiritual
Walking in hell's kitchen
Slow bitches standing on they tippy-toes
Sounds like what great things should sound like
Tyga fly though with no kite, vanilla sky
Don't need a mask this is my disguise
Her eyes saying color is mine
I done seen water cry

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, I'm in search for a better day
I put my mind in the clouds and try and get away
And I know I don't talk to the Lord much
Cause my mind racing thoughts moving like a tour bus
And niggas hatin', I try not to endure such
Cause the only thing I fear is me and the Lord trust
Everything I speak about, I really mean it nigga
I'm on my hustle I'm a Young Money greedy nigga
Believe it, nigga
It's a light at the end of the tunnel
If you don't see it take the scenic, nigga
I remember being broke on several days
Now I'm living out my dreams
Better days

[Hook]
