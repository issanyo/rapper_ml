[Hook: Du Boiz]
I just had a dope dream, a dope dream
I was in Miami swimming with the baddest chick
And she was wet in, I was deep in
Yeah, she was wet in, I was deep in
I just had a dope dream, a dope dream
I was in Miami swimming with the baddest chick
And she was wet in, I was deep in
Yeah, she was wet in, I was deep in

[Verse 1: Du Boiz]
It was 20/20 and I'm chillin' in the studio
Sippin' with the homies, talk a lot about a groupie hoe
Just killed that show in Coachella, we made a movie yo
Headlines be talking 'bout this boy is untouchable
I don't know why I wanna go to the hotel
I don't know why my homies didn't wanna get back
When I got there I did something that I won't tell
With this hot girl that looked like a freaking angel
Next thing you know it is 2016
And I'm sleeping on the clouds like dammit

[Hook: Du Boiz]
I just had a dope dream, a dope dream
I was in Miami swimming with the baddest chick
And she was wet in, I was deep in
Yeah, she was wet in, I was deep in
I just had a dope dream, a dope dream
I was in Miami swimming with the baddest chick
And she was wet in, I was deep in
Yeah, she was wet in, I was deep in

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, it was 3:05 in the 305, we had just left Liv
It's just me and you under neon lights, shine like my wrists
'Bout 3 for 10 you was in whip, 3:30 order steak and shrimp
That push start, that skrr, skrr
Blame it on the Smirnoff, shit
Ciroc bottles, Ciroc bottle
Now I'm looking at you like, are you sure you not top model?
My white tee shawty, might be wifey for me
I swear I mean it, but bitch I might be rolling
The sky was orange to purple
Oh my, your ass was going to circles
Oh my, I get nervous when it's perfect
Why oh, why do I deserve this?
Hol' up
I woke up in the club
Dossed off from the drugs
High on your love

[Hook: Du Boiz]
I just had a dope dream, a dope dream
I was in Miami swimming with the baddest chick
And she was wet in, I was deep in
Yeah, she was wet in, I was deep in
I just had a dope dream, a dope dream
I was in Miami swimming with the baddest chick
And she was wet in, I was deep in
Yeah, she was wet in, I was deep in

[Outro]
Yeah, to Miami
We had made it to Miami
Bad girl from Miami
She was bad
Yo man, give it to me
Yeah she gave it to me
Yeah she gave it to me
Yeah she gave it to me
Why I know
True story yeah, true story
Yeah I'm down for Miami
