[Intro]
I'm not always there when you call

[Chorus]
Uh, lil mami, lil mami, I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Ja Rule, Ashanti, where you want me, you got me
She's rockin' my hoodie, do you know how big this could be?
This could be everything, in Hollywood, where they say anything
Gone on the brown, sippin' on the Foxy
I was swerved off tequila
Asking for you number, slurrin'
Don't curve me, your hips, your thighs
I told them other hoes, yeah, bye bye
When you cry, I cry, you're mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine

[Verse 1]
Lil mami, got me foolish, Ashanti
Tell 'em what we gon' do if they move, plotty
Come from under the Tommy, bustin' the Tommy
That Masi' don't ride smooth as you
That 'Rari don't move smooth as you
My heart beats in tune with you
Every afternoon, you the noon it to

[Chorus]
Lil mami, lil mami, I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Ja Rule, Ashanti, where you want me, you got me
She's rockin' my hoodie, do you know how big this could be?
This could be everything, in Hollywood, where they say anything
Gone on the brown, sippin' on the Foxy
I was swerved off tequila
Askin' for you number, slurrin'
Don't curve me
Lil mami, lil mami, don't curve me
Lil mami, lil mami, don't curve me

[Verse 2]
What would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might, uh, all alone I might, uh
I bought a home, wait, it's not a home 'til I, hold up
Yeah, and the Lambo ain't as fun without you holdin' on
'Cause I can't deny it, you a straight rider
Fire and desire, the temperature's risin', keep it low, uh, low
Down for me, down for me, yeah, hold it in
You done got it out for me but they 'bout to see

[Chorus]
Lil mami, lil mami, I'm down for you, I'm down for you
Ja Rule, Ashanti, where you want me, you got me
She's rockin' my hoodie, do you know how big this could be?
This could be everything, in Hollywood, where they say anything
Gone on the brown, sippin' on the Foxy
I was swerved off tequila
Asking for you number, slurrin'
Don't curve me
Lil mami, lil mami, don't curve me
Lil mami, lil mami, don't curve me
