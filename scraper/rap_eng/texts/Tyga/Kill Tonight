[Intro/Hook:]
Feeling Like Some Patron Tonight
Yea I Just Got My Deal Tonight Tonight Tonight
And Them Girls Gonna Howl For Mike
Full Moon So I'm Gonna Bite
That's All That's All
If I'm Wrong Don't Steer Me Right
What I'm Wearing Can't Pronounce The Price
The Price The Price
Ride And Drive Can't Dim The Lights
So Tell The Sheriff I Just Kill Tonight
Tonight

[Verse 1:]
Waking Up The Man Every Damn Morning
A Few Honies Left Right Money
But Gets None From Me
My Days Lovely
Similiar To Rich Clubbing
Only Last Memories These Leftover Hornets
My Pockets Some Deposit
I Rather Plunge It You Got It?
I Ovedoes It I'm So Redundent
Since It Come So Often Why Not Offer
You Want It Work For It
Ain't No Clyde Cher And Bonnies
Benz And Harlies
Cali Niggas Riding
Outside Fence 'Em
How I Look At Shit I'm Inside It
I Take Flights Cause Ain't No Other Option
Tell The Pilot I'm Flying
Yes I Am...

[Verse 2:]
Pick Up My GD Brothers
Chain Colors
Yellow Butter
Seats Leather
Same Shade As Skin Nigga
I Feel Parch Really Talk Only Big Business
I Approach Even Close My Eyes See Your Vision
Collide With This Collision
Conclusion Your Whole Teams Losing
You Still Be A Nuesence I'm The New Whiz
Old Headset He Keeps Improving
New Boosters Now Buy And Bump To It
Damn it's Midnight And I Just Realized
This Time 05 I Was Lioving In What I Drived In
Now I'm Living In Houses You Could Drive In
Buy Freds Come On Now You Know I'm Just

[Verse 3:]
It's Gone Gameover The Hangover
Just Wanna Do It Over Again Without Tomorrow
But Don't Go Back Friends
Cause We Got Benz
Who So Much Pop Bottle Poppin
Like Fairytales It'll Never End
The Move I Do It I Live It When I Can
I'm Vivid My Life Should Be In High Definition
I'm What You See On Television
Focus And Listen
You Wouldn't Want To Miss It For The Would I'm Demirring
Doc Told Me I'm My Own Prescription
Myself Would Only Allow The Healing I'm Finished
Ready To Pop Out And The Mischief
But Don't Get It Mixed Up Slim
I'm Not Them
I'm Just I'm Just...
