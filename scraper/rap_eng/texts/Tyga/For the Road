[Verse 1: Tyga]
They say what goes around comes around (round)
And I know I made mistakes and you forgave me how (how)
I don't understand, you know I'm trying the best I can (can)
I guess it's consequences when you dealing with sin (sin)
And even sacrificed your friends over me
All them nights in the club turn to nights with me
It's like the same old story out your diary (diary)
Memories never fade but only in time we'll see (see)
Hope to see you with me 'cause...

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, grippin' and biting
Remember the times after fighting
You said you loved me, I liked it
Became obsessed with the sexing
You screaming, “Whose is it?” we naked
Now I'm pullin' your hair told you take it
A couple of shots, now we faded
Don't even know we made it, we home
Got that look in your eyes like hope you mine
Said you hoped the feeling’s real, really tired of all the lies
One minute we fine, then we not, everything I do you can't
But that's no reason for making mistakes, this time put it all on the plate
I, I told you be loyal, spoil you, never disown you
You get lonely when I'm touring, just hold it down ,be supportive
I'll be back in the morning, that new purse you wanted
What's good if you can't flaunt it (flaunt it), show it
Ain't the same, better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make, make you understand, make you understand that

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one (oh, for you)
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up (oh, made mistakes, I know I fucked up)
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
All I ever wanted was your happiness
But right now let's get right down to it, let's handle this business
If you gonna leave me tonight, I gotta kiss it goodbye
Girl, I'm 'bout to make it cry, and all I need is one more time 'cause my...

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Last time, best time, better than my next time
Rolex and vest time, Moët it's sex time
Hard to let go, a part of you gon’ be alone
Scrolling your phone, looking at texts, seems like not too long ago
Ain't the same better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And it's no way I can pay you back (back)
But my plan is to make, make you understand, make you understand that

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road
