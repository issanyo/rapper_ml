Everywhere I go, all the girls say they love me

I'm half above the stage, all the girls try to hug me

Diamonds on the chain, all the girls wanna touch it

You see me with a chick, I bet the girls ain't nothing!

Gotta know Diego, and if you don't know me

You know I got ‘em girl, that gonna get dance for me!

These girls say they love me, the bottles keep coming

Pills on the. yeah, you can see me coming!

I got girls on my left, and girls on my right

She gonna hold me... but she's mine for the night

And baby see the wheels, I can show you how to road

Flow so stupid, you never make diamond roll!

We're in the club doing the same old two steps

I play these whore, and I swear I ain't lose yet!

My paper on dough how it had to be

Hold on, hold on, man, that's your girl calling me!

Man, all these bitches love me

Take your girl out, tale your money

She my slave... that was nothing

Heard you pillow talk, secrets undercover

Cause that ain't real, that ain't real

Man, you're fake like ‘em poppets

Um, two Ferraris, one body

Two pictures...

And I'm cold flying...

Got these bitches... than a fucking pirate

OK! Tape it the robber band, ... in that pussy like ...

Yeah, yeah, really do this shit for real

Man, you niggers just hanging like chandeliers

All gold, walking like a souvenir

Man, I made more than your career in my fiscal year!

Uh, me and cash till my money drop

...swan, say too much!
