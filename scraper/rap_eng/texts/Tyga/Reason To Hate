[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
I dont know about you I'm doin what I do
And the way I'm livin' is great
Only thing that I can do, every day continue
Give them haters reason to hate

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
So I'mma live it up (give them haters a reason)
I'mma turn it up (give them haters a reason)
I'mma spend it all (give them haters a reason)
Cause you know I love (give them haters a reason)
Give them a reason to hate

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-Raw straight from a dice game
Came up roll a Rolls Royce seats light tan
Now we pop champagne for all the suffering and pain
Used to stay in when it rain now I go out and make it rain
No shame, I can pay a years rent with one chain
Still with the same niggas courtside Lakers game
I just took advantage, you just took for granted
Mansion by Nicki crib errthang rented
Damn new case stand in the last king livin'
Bread over bed Stunna said We the business
No reala for , show me love when you see a nigga
Sippin' slow mo in the motion picture, get a ..

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
God damn, I'm the man
And I ain't tryna piss nobody off but I'm just sayin'
My new car, custom painted
In the club everybody show me love like I'm Raymond
Paparazzi taking pictures cause we famous
Money long what I'm smokin' on is dangerous
Ooh, you can use some new arrangements
In the back Im tryna move you up to A-list
And they know Im reppin' Taylor to the grave
Catch me working on some slave shit
For the chains whips
Your favorite rapper on your playlist
Got rich when they were drunk then they find we ain't gon' smoke

[Outro]
Give em a reason to hate
Da da da, da da da
Dont stop, we going to the top
Always keep them haters fed up
(Give em a reason to hate)
Dont stop, dont never let up
Take that paper get your bread up
(Give em a reason)
Dont stop, we going to the top
Always keep them haters fed up
(Give em a reason to hate)
Dont stop, dont never let up
Take that paper get your bread up
(Give em a reason)
