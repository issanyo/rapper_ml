So baby close the door
Let your dress slip down to the floor
Baby I'm sure
We gon' get it in
I'm gon' do it proper
We can take our time
You ain't even gotta rush, no
The only ones in class are us oh
And there's so many things that I wanna see
Plus a few things that I wanna teach
Ohh Whoaa ho
I wanna take you home
Are you coming?
Get right to the point with my loving yea
You learning something new for the night
Ima do you right, yeah
Ima change your life
Tell me, tell me whats it gon' be?
Baby are you coming coming home with me?
Baby

[Chorus]
Girl you wanna leave
That ain't nothing but a word to me
Me and you can get up in them sheets
That's sex 101 baby, yeah
And if you wanna leave
Show you things that you've never seen
Do the things that you won't believe
That's sex 101 baby, baby, yeah

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, lay down on the bed flat
Got your light I ain't know it was like that
Bitin' on your neck
Don't be scared to bite back
Once I get you wet know you can't fight that
Soaking in the sheets hope you got another set
Cause when I'm done guarantee we gon' leave a mess
Rubbing on my tatts put this ice on your chest
Sex all night one on one no stress
Uh, get you high when I'm going low
Got the heavy metal shit no rock n roll
Roll you up now I'm licking in your ear lobe
Nice and slow, like usher though
Most women they tempt me to move fast
But I'mma make the time stretch like gym class
Bet you never had, keep you coming back
To back, to back, to back


[Chorus]
Girl you wanna leave
That ain't nothing but a word to me
Me and you can get up in them sheets
That's sex 101 baby, yeah
And if you wanna leave
Show you things that you've never seen
Do the things that you won't believe
That's sex 101 baby, baby, yeah


[Hook]
Sex 101, its one on one
Sex 101, its one on one
Sex 101, its one on one

(Love love yeah)

[Break: Jay Sean]
Girl I really wanna test your body
Got so many questions yea
And you ain't even needa ask no body
I'll teach you the lesson yea
Touch me here, touch you there
Kiss me here, any where
Feels so right can't go wrong all night long


[Hook]
Sex 101, sex 101, s-sex 101
Sex 101, sex 101, s-sex 101
Sex 101 sex 101


[Chorus]
Girl you wanna leave
That ain't nothing but a word to me
Me and you can get up in them sheets
That's sex 101 baby, yeah
And if you wanna leave
Show you things that you've never seen
Do the things that you won't believe
That's sex 101 baby, baby, yeah
(Don't you wanna leave?)
