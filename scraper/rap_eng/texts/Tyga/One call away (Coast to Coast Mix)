Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take my hand

No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

Come along with me and don't be scared

And when you're weak I'll be strong
I'm gonna keep holding on
Now don't you worry, it won't be long, darling
And when you fell like hope is gone
Just run into my arms

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one, I'm only one....
Call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away
