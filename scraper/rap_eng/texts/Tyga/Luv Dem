[Verse 1: Tyga]
Let's play black car, Black Audemar
For the love of money, I'm a die hard
Fucking role model, tell these bitches, play your part
I blew up off one tape
I take a Dime, a movie star
Foreign cars, my language off
Old school, like Cooley High
Your bitch, she getting sodomized
My money blink like Lloyd's eyes
These niggas telling, like all lies
Said they want beef, but they french fries
I'm hot popping, nigga deep fried
These bitches sweating me, perspire
Tell Nicki, she want Chyna she'll turn you out
Had a white bitch like No Doubt
Busting nut's for four hours
I'm on the jet getting drugged out
Jordan face, her tongue out
I'm throwing money like paper routes
My flow hard like the world gout
She eat pussy, cat down
Can't see me, background
School niggas, cap gown
Click clack, smoke cloud
Lumberjack, tall niggas
Paul Bunyan, I wish you would
All my niggas like Trayvon
Ready to die for their hood
Ball hard, no fucking catch
My shit real, your figures wax
Your Rollie ain’t Rolex
Like Mankind, get socked next
We don’t fuck with P90X
Cause all my niggas they do is flex
My car made for races
Like to fuck with rednecks
I’m on some different shit
Hop out then I pull up
Motherfucking little Mikey icey like cooler
I don’t need no help
Never fucked with no tutors
Talking all that head
Throw me in your medulla
T-Raww I’m stepping out
Bail money I’m handing out
I ain’t scared of y’all niggas
Manny Pacquiao
Strip search, I pat her down
Wiz Khalifa, I’m smoking loud
Like A$AP I got a fucking problem
Fuckin’ problem, I’m a problem child
