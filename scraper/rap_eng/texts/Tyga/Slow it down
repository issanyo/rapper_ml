Tyga- Slow It Down Lyrics

[Hook]
Now that shorties in my bedroom saying “what should we do?”
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Slow it dooooown. [x4]

Uh, gotta find her
Thought to my mind, don’t wanna be lonely tonight
Whatever

[VERSE 1]
Stepped out, threw my diamond s sweater
On to the grocery, quarter eleven
The aisles with the beverages, 347
Seen two college chicks, why you gigglin?
I asked, they said “you be on television”
“Wait, your Tyga, my friend wants a picture”
So you live close by? Next thing I’m looking in her eyes

[Hook]
Now that shorties in my bedroom saying “what should we do?”

I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Slow it dooooown. [x4]


Uh, gotta find her
Thought to my mind, don’t wanna be lonely tonight
Whatever

[VERSE 2]
Later on, hit the club. I’m chillen
Funny how time flies when you in it
Valet Bentley, gently tinted
Seen misses, she use to stay in my building
Ten fifty
God, never seen you in a dress before
So you moved? Where to?
“To the hills of Hollywood, you should come.. visit.. soon”

[Hook]
Now that shorties in my bedroom saying “what should we do?”

I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Slow it dooooown. [x4]

[BREAKDOWN]
Hoooou, ooooooh (no need to rush it, ya know)
So take your time
As the one for me
So ease your mind
As the one for me

[VERSE 3]
Uhh, I’m feeling better already
We’ve been steady
Put a diamond lump on your damn pinkie
I do miss you, just been busy
Do you miss me?
How bout I come get you?

[Hook]
Now that shorties in my bedroom saying “what should we do?”
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Now that shorties up in my place saying do it her way
I said “hey, don’t slow it down”
Slow it dooooown. [x4]
