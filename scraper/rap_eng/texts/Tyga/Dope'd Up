If your bitch got a booty, better squeeze it
I catch her slippin' and i'ma put her on her PJ

She gave me head, then I asked "wait where you headed?"
I hit the game like a dope'd up needle
You fuck with niggas,who fuck you but won't feed you

All that dope said she love, she spend the brick on the clothes
I told my bitch you better go on and fuckin' whip it
When they play my shit in the club uh, rub your titties
I'm doin' cardio nigga I run the city
Married to the game VVS is on my ring finger
Money talk what it say, I'm made it
Diamonds keepin' pupils dilated
