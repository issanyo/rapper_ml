Hi, I'm looking for Molly
I've been searching everywhere

And I can't seem to find
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly

Bands all in my dollars
I'm everywhere, wrist poppin'
Can't fall in love I got options
I'm high school that's college
King Gold Chains, that's Notre Dame
That green, yeah I got it
I show up in the party
Like where the f*** that molly
O-D we're O-G's
We don't f*** with no police
I'm too fly to be low key
Them 24 inch Kobes
All black that's Jodeci
She gimme p**** that's Josie
Broke n****s stop beggin' me
Cause that's the s*** that I don't need
I'm swervin', I'm drivin'
Ain't got time to be tired
I'm super turnt, don't try me
Killin' yo mind off and f***in' yo body
B**** wanna flick, pose for my posse
Got too much s*** to worry about gossip
I'm on a bad trip

And I can't seem to find
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)

Lil' b****, my sanction is important
My new car's imported
My bank account is enormous
Weed so loud it's distorted
Got champagne and we pourin' it
She poppin' it and she snortin' it
My iPhone recordin' it, if I want it, I can afford it
B**** I'm Young Khalifa, fillin' my lungs with reefer
Somewhere in the clouds, gotta press up to see us
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my b**** so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some s*** that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I made, then you won't even believe it
Me and T-Y gettin' gnarly when we pull up to the party
Brought a whole pound of Mary

And I can't seem to find
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)

Put it in my drink, put it in my drink
Put it in my drink, you already know
Put it in my drink, put it in my drink
Put it in my drink, you already know
She had me smokin', had me smokin'
Smokin' on my reefer
She had me smokin', had me smokin'
Smokin' on my reefer (And I can't seem to find)

Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her)
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly (F***ed around and fell in love with her
