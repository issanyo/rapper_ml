[Verse 1: Legacy]
She call me daddy but she not my daughter
I say i got a girl she tryin to fuck me harder
I only tell her to avoid cheating, but all i do is make her more freaky
She fucking hate it when i bring her up
I hate the fact that im still in love
These side hoes ain't the ended tho, i need another way to let it go

[hook: Legacy]
I don't sip lean but you can pour that shit up
I don't pop pills but u can slip me one
Dont got no tatoos but you only live once
I don't give no fucks, i don't give no fucks(x2)
Right now... right now(x3)

[verse 2: Legacy]
Said I been walking to the telly be there in one minute
Got kicked out the cab because I threw up in it
I drank too much I bay some slush than hit the tree
Always do things out of spite, but no one feel this shit but me
I don't think it's love it's greed
I dont do same what i need
I just need to chill
Only bitch i need is peace
(only bitch i need is peace x2)
