[Intro: Tyga]
Yeah, money comes so fast, the bitches won’t last, uh

[Hook: Tyga & Chris Brown]
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Bust it open bitch, do it, do it, do it, do it
What you workin' with? Do it, do it, do it, do it
Drop it to the floor, do it, do it, do it, do it, bust it on the pole
Do it, do it, babe, for me, for me
Do it, do it, babe, for me, for me, do it, do it, babe, for me
I’m popping all these bottles
So just take that, take that, shake that, shake that
Do it for the side, stay open, bitch
You wanna fly, I’m floating, bitch
Gon' do that shit for a real nigga
Pop it on the floor and try to kill a nigga

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Hey little mama, I know you ‘bout your paper
And my money, money green, I’m in charge, no captain save her
I'ma provide everything you need, no middle man, no in-between
Girl, quit burning all of your flight miles, just get on this jet with me
God damn, so much money, nigga think I’m pulling credit card scams
Step up in the spot and bitches know just who I am
You call me dada, I buy my bitches Prada
Eating shrimp and lobster, after that I eat her yaya

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
If you’re horny, let’s do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Do it, do it, babe for me, for me
Do it, do it, babe for me, for me, do it, do it, babe for me
I’m popping all these bottles
So just take that, take that, shake that, shake that
Do it for the side, they upping bitch
You wanna fly, I’m floating bitch
Gon' do that shit for a real nigga
Pop it on the floor and try to kill a nigga

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, that’s dice game, she on the floor, she up early, that’s high school
At K.O.D. and Onyx too, she takin' flights, she comfortable
She put in time, she workin' hard, but not enough to bake cakes too
If she met a nigga like me, nah, I’m spring breakin' that pussy loose
Like hunnid, hunnid dollar bills, throw ‘em in the air, air
I'ma make it back, nigga, I don’t really care, care
Felt on the panties, shit was soakin'
Private room, now that pussy open

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
If you’re horny, let’s do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and

[Hook: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Do it, do it, babe for me, for me
Do it, do it, babe for me, for me, do it, do it, babe for me
I’m popping all these bottles
So just take that, take that, shake that, shake that
Do it for the side, they upping bitch
You wanna fly, I’m floating bitch
Gon' do that shit for a real nigga
Pop it on the floor and try to kill a nigga
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Bust it open bitch, do it, do it, do it, do it
What you workin' with? Do it, do it, do it, do it
Drop it to the floor, do it, do it, do it, do it, bust it on the pole
