[Verse 1: Honey Cocaine]
Bitch I'm bout that Gwola
Honey got green like papa

You still in the bleachers baby
Be a boss ass bitch

Stunt hard and it kills y'all

No stress no sweat, like a muhfuckin sauna

In the club more shots than a sawed off
Ain't nothing in the closet, knock off
Knock knock who there get ya girl dawg

Roll up smoke a O in the West Coast Cali
Move from the hood to the valley
Par 3 backyard don't act caddy

[Maino]
Yea

[Verse 3: Maino]
I'm bout that Gwola
Talk money talk dollars
Snapback pair of Mark Jacob visors
Ya girl see me then she vanish like walah
Treat these boys like sons

They know, They know when I came through
Chicks knew and they go Maino
Then I get my wild on
Style on, spending thousands
In the club with a crown on
And not even my king ways
Black ray, 5 king play
Roll with a king baby
Oh even if they hate me
Real niggas shine greatly
Shirt smelling like cocaine
Honey bout blew
I don't know about these hoes
Money falling out my clothes
You know what I'll holla
Everything bout my dollars
All day about my Gwola

[Pre-Chorus: Honey Cocaine]
Get dollars, Get Get Dollars
I ain't fuckin' with it if it ain't bout Gwola
Get dollars, Get Get Dollars
I ain't fuckin' with it if it ain't bout Gwola

[Chorus: Honey Cocaine]
I don't know about these hoes

Ball out there with it I go
Errybody in the streets they know

Bitch I'm bout that Gwola
All about that Gwola)
