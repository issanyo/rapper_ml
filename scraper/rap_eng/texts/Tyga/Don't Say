[Verse 1: Tyga]
Unh
She needs me, I need her
But money first, that's my concern
When it's all said and done, that's what means most
We could start a family, you'd be the perfect host
La Costa Nostra on a different coast
I'm supposed to love you, but love how you broke
Hard on the flo' with your angel wings
Sounds of love making, let a angel sing

[Verse 2: Liz]
I don't wanna walk, I wanna run
Fly, soar to the top
The situations are changing
Can't ignore all the mistakes
But I'm still in love

You got me spending my days caught up
Thinking about us stealing the clock
Oh where the time go?
Ain't  paying no attention
Rewriting each word so they involve ya
Life made other plans
But if you're watching from the stands
Just know it's all for you

[Hook: Liz, Tyga]
Maybe this time we can make it work, work, work, work
(Work, work, work, work, work, work)
Just our love's enough that it will work, work, work, work
(Work, work, work, work, work, work)
If you ever thought that it could work, work, work, work
(Work, work, work, work, work, work)

Can we talk about you?
Can we talk about me?
Ain't nothing to talk about
Don't say, don't say
Ain't nothing to talk about
Don't say, don't say

[Verse 3: Liz]
Try, 'member we once saw eye-to-eye
Don't say it, don't
Talk out those words you once said were true
Now, you still say'em
Do they sound different to you?

Got me twisted like bed sheets
On a sleepless night, stealing the clock
Oh, where the time go?
Ain't tryna make drama just getting myself right
I won't call you
I know you're hurtin' too
Won't you let me through
So I can talk to you

[Hook: Liz, Tyga]
Maybe this time we can make it work, work, work, work
(Work, work, work, work, work, work)
Just our love's enough that it will work, work, work, work
(Work, work, work, work, work, work)
If you ever thought that it could work, work, work, work
(Work, work, work, work, work, work)

Can we talk about you?
Can we talk about me?
Ain't nothing to talk about
Don't say, don't say
Ain't nothing to talk about
Don't say, don't say

[Verse 4: Tyga]
I worked hard, you blew the spot up
Had a condo for your puppy and the two of us
Two young kids in lust, planning arrangements
Who ever thought we'd split apart like a paper cut?
Could've been us, memory lane on the tour buss
Now it's like pre-nup, no marriages
But it felt like one to all your friends
Don't blame me for what I haven't done
That excuse is endless, it's overdone
As I sit back, relax, while my new chick
Ass is like a couch so I sleep in
No creeping but it's creep-like
Cause when I'm touching her, I think of you at night

[Bridge: Liz, Tyga]
Love how it used to be
Sometimes I still feel you next to me
Oh, I don't need no guarantee
Can we talk about you? (Let me know)
Can we talk about me?

Love how it used to be (Yeah)
Sometimes I still feel you next to me (Tyga)
Oh, I don't need no guarantee (That ain't lovin' tho)
Can we talk about you?
Can we talk about me?

Ain't nothing to talk about
Don't say, don't say
Ain't nothing to talk about
Don't say, don't say
