[Verse: Markell Clay]
Touchdown, West Coast
LA, West Coast
Forever
Palm trees up in there
Gas up, let’s ride
I rise, we could fly
No runs outside
Here I can make you some
Cus the way you lookin, girl I can put you in a magazine
Something you ain’t never seen
Makin dreams in the alley
(You’re my West Coast Crush)

[Pre-Hook: Markell Clay]
Cus the way you lookin, girl I can put you in a magazine
Something you ain’t never seen
Photo shoots and a sudden kiss

[Hook: Markell Clay]
Oh baby it’s the two of us
I think I found my West Coast crush
Now all my ladies say (la la la…)
Come on, every lady (la la la…)
You’re my West Coast Crush

[Verse: Tyga]
When I look at you it’s cinematic
Relaxin in my Maybach, they like it back up at it
The view is panamaric, you like it then I grab it
For you a trip to Paris, stargazing from the terrace
6 inch heels, spending G’s in Max Phill’s
That’s them, do good to yo people, Shawty keep it trill
My life a film
Gotta feel what I’m teaching you
Go to heights they ain’t reaching so no stopping me and you
(You’re my West Coast Crush)
Now the cake saved me and you
Bought the whole place, just a night for two
Plenty rooms, I gotta make room
T-Raw, dreamin all the nasty things I’d do to you

[Pre-Hook: Markell Clay]
Cus the way you lookin, girl I can put you in a magazine
Something you ain’t never seen
Photo shoots and a sudden kiss

[Hook: Markell Clay]
Oh baby it’s the two of us
I think I found my West Coast crush
Now all my ladies say (la la la…)
Come on, every lady (la la la…)
You’re my West Coast Crush

[Verse: The Game]
Make some room for me
Girl call your mama, tell her run and get a broom for me
The way I sweep her off her feet was something out a movie
Just like Keisha and Beverly the way she do it to me
Love the way she do it to me
Ride like it a purebred, roll around in girl’s bed
Every position I could think of until the world end
Shoppin in Chanelle, girl named Shanelle
Graduated but she grew up off in Slawson
I could tell by the way she wrote them L’s
If she want it she deserve it
Workin 9 to 5 but when she off I let her twerk it
And I had to call my grandma
Tell her that she the one
And my grandma told me to get it done, I had to

[Pre-Hook: Markell Clay]
Cus the way you lookin, girl I can put you in a magazine
Something you ain’t never seen
Photo shoots and a sudden kiss

[Hook: Markell Clay]
Oh baby it’s the two of us
I think I found my West Coast crush
Come on, every lady (la la la…)
Come on, every lady (la la la…)
You’re my West Coast Crush
