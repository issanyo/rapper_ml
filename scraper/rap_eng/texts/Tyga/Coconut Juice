[Intro]
Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up [x3]
Twist it all up! Twist it all up!

[Hook One]
Everybody in the party
Hold your cup high move your body
If you twist it, scream it loudly
Ay, ay, ay, HEY! Ay, ay, ay, HEY!

[Hook Two]
Coconut juice got me real loose, like
Got me leanin three thousand proof, like
Coconut juice all on the dance FLOOR
Fellas let your ladies GO ladies let your fellas GO

[Tyga]
COME back, went straight to the club
Entrance no charge cause we late to the club
Ummmm yes, we don't stand in the club
G.E.D. on the couch pourin drinks on the rug
What a mess! But we clean in the club
Ice so bright make a fight scene in the club
Donnnn't test, cause there's beams in the club
Red beams in the club leave your jeans full of blood

[Hook Two] + [Intro]

[Tyga]
Commmme back! DJ, can I get a replay?
Ay, ay, ay, HEY! Ay, ay, ay, HEY!
I think the artist name, was like Tyga mayne
And he said, "I'm getting every dollar on G.E.D."
V.I., important person
Rap's most important person, so po-tent
And I'm up in this thing with my thing up
And she shakin that thing her momma gave her

[Hook Two] + [Intro] + [Hook One]

[Interlude: Tyga]
Ha~! Hope you're not tired
This is just a breakdown

[Travis McCoy]
Br-br-br-br-br-break down like Britney, forgive me but I said it
Whether you're notty dreaded or crazy baldheaded
Jump up if you love it, no guns in this jammy
So what he's my cousin, sexy runs in the family

[Hook Two] + [Intro]

[Outro]
Hey - ay, ay, ay, HEY! Ay, ay, ay, HEY!

Hey - ay, ay, ay, HEY! Ay, ay, ay, HEY!
Hey - ay, ay, ay, HEY! Ay, ay, ay, HEY!
