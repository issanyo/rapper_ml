[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yeah
D.A. got that dope!
Go

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
You already know (You already)
My protocol (Oh)
I wouldn't say they greedy, but they come back for more (More)
Superstar status, baby, hold the applause (Yeah, superstar status)
My life a movie, baby, you're in this episode (Ohh)
Yo, dressed down in this bitch, woah
Takin' bad bitches home wit' me (Ooh)
Give a damn about receipts, oh (Ooh)
Spend it all, watch it blow away
Take a dose, don't misuse it
Pop fifteen, make her dreams come true (Ayy)
All my cash come blue
Shine on these niggas like we always do (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
(Hah)
I done seen rap niggas (Yeah)
Come and dap niggas (Yeah)
Turn they back on ya, now they wanna rap with ya (Damn)
Ten years in the race, I done overlapped niggas (Pew)
Platinum in my ring, I done sold plaques, nigga (Damn)
Takin' shots at a beast had to come attack niggas (Hah)
Treat you like my son, I don't need a babysitter (Nope)
I reinvent the rhythm, niggas wanna reconsider (Bah)
Fallin' in the bank, I'll be gone 'til November (Fume)
Take a famous bitch, then I turn her to a sinner (Freak)
Bad bitches only, tell them niggas, "Do not enter" (Nope)
I pack pack, puttin' the bitches in a sprinter (Yeah)
I switch flow, switch whip into Aventa' (Fume)
I eat this beat like a TV dinner (Uhm)
On your TV, don't fall asleep on a nigga (Yeah)
I'm swimming in this money, R.I.P. Mac Miller (Damn)
And I'm loyal to my soul, I'm a Hometown Hero

[Bridge: Tyga & Swae Lee]
Where ya bread at? (Bread at)
Where ya bread at? (Bread at)
Where ya crib? Where ya muhfuckin' bed at? (Bed at)
Is that your best friend (Best friend), can I smash that? (Smash that)
Where the smoke? Where the liquor? Where your niggas at? (Niggas at, woah)
Where ya bread at? (Bread at)
Where ya bread at? (Bread at)
Where ya crib? Where ya muhfuckin' bed at? (Bed at)
Is that your best friend, can I smash that? (Smash that)
Where the smoke? Where the liquor? Where your niggas at? (Niggas at)

[Verse 2: Tyga & Swae Lee]
I'm gettin' hella racks (Yeah)
Aye, aye, I'm throwin' racks on her muhfuckin' ratchet ass (Rack, rack, rack, rack it up, rack it up)
Aye, I ain't got no game, baby I just talk big facts (Big facts, big facts, aye, yeah, oh shit )
Aye, throw some cheese in the corner, turn that bitch to a hood rat (She a hood rat, she a hood rat)
I don't love 'em, I don't cuff 'em, I just fuck 'em, hope you cool with that
I hope you cool, baby, yeah (I hope you cool)
I don't love 'em, I don't cuff 'em, I just fuck 'em, hope you cool with that

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
You already know (You already)
My protocol (Oh)
I wouldn't say they greedy, but they come back for more (More)
Superstar status, baby, hold the applause (Yeah, superstar status)
My life a movie, baby, you're in this episode (Ohh)
