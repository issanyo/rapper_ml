[Chorus - Ty Dolla $ign]
Twerk it for a real one
Twerk it for a real one
Girl, twerk it for a real one
Twerk it for a real one - oh yeahhhhh!
Twerk it for a real one
Twerk it for a real one - oh yeahhhhh!
Twerk it for a real one

[Bridge - Ty Dolla $ign]
Young bitch, get ratchet
Bring your home girls, let's get nasty
I got a stripper pole, in my living room
And I'm tryna see what that shit do, girl

[Verse 1 - Ty Dolla $ign]
My name is Dolla $ign, but you call me Daddy
I can see you from the front, you gotta fatty
Get low for a real nigga
Do a trick and I'll split a little wit' cha
Do a handstand for these bands
Make it clap, no hands on these bands
Work, work, work like Montana
Put that motherfuckin' monkey on this banana
And I'mma nail the pussy, go hammer
Yup, I finesse the pussy, Atlanta
Pushaz Ink nigga and I'm Taylor
Twerk something for a player!

[Chorus]
[Bridge]

[Verse 2 - Joe Moses]
Let me DDP in your vagina
I gotta model bitch just like Tyra (what?)
She wearin' nothing but Louis and more designer
I got my one eye on you, I'm like a pirate (haha!)
I love The Way she dance, she like CiCi
I'm out The 504, I'm like BG
Me and Chris is cool, but where RiRi? (huh?)
You like to French Kiss, well here's the oui oui [wee wee]
See, my bitches is fly, and they friends is freaks
I make them shake that ass, and bounce it on that meat
I wanna see you twerk, the turn up is real
With that big ole ass, that's how you feel - eh?

[Chorus]
[Bridge]

[Verse 3 - Tyga]
Oooh, kill 'em!
She back, hurt a nigga feelings
That ho wit it, won't tell a soul if I hit it
My ex-bitches, friends for my next bitches
I play Mr. Nice Guy to all my bitches (oooh!)
She got that ass, call her Ashley (ah!)
She said it's real, grab it
I ain't even ask her! (ah!)
Oooh, so nasty
Oh, you know who yo' daddy?
That thing, fatty
Only thing missing, T-Raww tatted
Cold nigga heart, let me drill in it
Yeah, My Bitch Bad - I put AMil in it
I'm Bill Thrill in a Beetle, fly nigga
Show me something worth dealing
Up and down, bitch!

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
