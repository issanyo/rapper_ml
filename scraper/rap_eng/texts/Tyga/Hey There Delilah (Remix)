[Verse 1: Tyga (Tom Higgenson)]
(Hey There Delilah)
I've been thinking bout your flyness
Dreamin' bout the first time we was vibin'
On the phone sayin' the words love is silent
But wow that chick so stylish
Even made my drama your problems
And the equation you help me solve it
You've been there before the popular Tyga
I was not ballin'

[Chorus: Tom Higgenson]
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
What You Do To Me

[Verse 2: Tyga (Tom Higgenson)]
(Hey There Delilah)
Ouch feel like my heart is cryin'
Cause your light years away from where I am
Well that's what it seems like Ms. Delilah
There's no other thing like a Ms. Delilah
This court outta divide me from Ms. Delilah
No I'm turnin into a Mr. Violent
All cause I was sprung on Ms. Delilah
Now You See It

[Chorus: Tom Higgenson]
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
What You Do To Me

[Verse 3: Tyga]
I'm on a freeway doin' 90
With police sirens behind me
Going to a place that you cannot find me
Cause I'm through
No more me and you
Angel eyes but a devil in disguise
In this car, I'm dyin cause of a cheating liar
But that's what you get fuckin with Delilah

[Chorus: Tom Higgenson]
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
Oh It's What You Do To Me
What You Do To Me
