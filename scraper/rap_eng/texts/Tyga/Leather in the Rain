[Intro: Tyga]
My intuition is telling me, alright

[Verse 1: Tyga]
My intuition tells me that you're getting in this whip with me
Tell me what you're into, we can get into it endlessly, get into it endlessly
See she can wear leather in the rain, she can find pleasure in pain
Say my name, say my name, say it, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Tyga]
See she can wear leather in the rain, she can find pleasure in pain, oh yeah
Say my name, say my name, say it, babe
She run me wrong, run, run me wrong, keep me, keep me coming
Yeah, I pull up on her bumper, let's get reckless, let's get reckless
Take it slow like we in Texas, take it to the island, ride her like a jetski, yeah
Baby, just let me if you're ready, let's see

[Chorus: Tyga & Kyndall]
If you think you're ready, let's see
If you think you're ready, let's see
Oh, ready, ready, yeah
Ready

[Verse 2: Kyndall]
My intutition tell me you really not so innocent
And baby, the vibe that you're giving me's intentional, intentional, intentional
I can feel how intense it is, feel the intensity
See he can wear leather in the rain, he can find pleasure in pain
Say my name, say my name, say it, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Kyndall]
He can wear leather in the rain, he can find pleasure in pain, baby
Say my name, say my name, there's nobody's around
Spend time with me, not money, thats how you keep me, keep me coming, coming
Pull up on my bumper, let's get reckless, reckless
Hold me close, come to my rescue, take it to the islands, ride it like a jetski, yeah
Baby, just let me, let me, if you're ready, let's see

[Chorus: Kyndall]
If you think you're ready, let's see
If you think you're ready, let's see
Oh, ready, ready, yeah
Ready
Oh, ready, ready, yeah
Ready
Ready
Ready
