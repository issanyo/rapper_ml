(& R. Kelly)

I gotta chick that love, I gotta chick that love me
I gotta chick that love, I gotta chick that love me
I gotta chick that love me, I gotta chick that love me
And she’ll do anything for me that’s why I f*cks with her

I f*cks with her hard call it my little ghetto sex soldier
She ain’t like them other chicks
Gotta nigga ..f*ck and she got enough respect to make a nigga feel like a president
..shawty ain’t playin sex so good she’s just got me sayin I’m ..
I toast to the way that she do me ..she put it on me she even bring a friend for me
That’s why I buy her everything ‘cause she is the baddiest thing ..up in the club

Chorus:
I gotta chick that love, I gotta chick that love me
I gotta chick that love, I gotta chick that love me
I gotta chick that love me, I gotta chick that love me
And she’ll do anything for me that’s why I f*cks with her

I ain’t gotta tell her once whatever it is she gonna do it like ..ain't sh** to it like
Don't listen to your friends, no matter what they’re telling you
She listen to her man ‘cause we gonna ride forever
We be in the phantom ghost.. doing the most ..got alot of haters jealous ‘cause we’re still together
This right here is gonna last forever
Just you and me together, through the stormy weather ohhh..
That’s why I buy her everything ‘cause she is the baddiest thing up in the club..

[Chorus:]
[Tyga]
Hold up baby kick my feet up
On the table dinner ready that's my baby
Cook my favorite spaghetti
Angel hair fettucine then we fuck until we dreamin
Wakin up around eleven now we rollin like it's Cali
Got a fine dark skin like kesha up in belly
Ah really I ain't ready commitment is just to heavy
I ain't trippin she ain't trippin
She ain't flippin through my celly
We're both grown, lower your tone I'm just kiddin
We both winnin, like Jordan to the pippin
Hope you ain't feelin different 'cause most of them girls was digits
But you I play my cards right royal flush finish (oh)
Gotta chick that love me no attitude she hug me
Li-lick me down and rub me lo-loyal when she for me
Too many homie owe me push em to the side
'Cause they ain't down to ride
Like my chick that love me

[Chorus:]
