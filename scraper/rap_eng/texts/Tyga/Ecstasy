[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Doin a hundred on the freeway
With no seat-belt on
Tryna to get away
But I keep goin back to love
Even when you ain't next to me
You're the only still in my memory
Its like my heart won't let up
So baby here I am

[Hook]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way, oh
I'm on my way
Back to your heart
(Your love, your love, your love, your love)
Back to your heart
And all I want is you

[Chorus]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
Cause your love like ecstasy
When I want you closer
You the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But your love like ecstasy

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no
Your love like ecstasy
Oh no
Your love like ecstasy

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
Even when you ain't right at times
Girl, you still find a way to stay in my mind
Its like with you I can't wait all
If lovin you was a dead crime
I'd be locked up doin' 20 to life
So much emotions built inside
So baby here I am

[Hook]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way, oh
I'm on my way
Back to your heart
(Your love, your love, your love, your love)
Back to your heart
And all I want is you

[Chorus]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
Cause your love like ecstasy
When I want you closer
You the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But your love like ecstasy

[Post-Chorus]
Oh no
Your love like ecstasy
Oh no
Your love like ecstasy

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Who that, scream my name baby
Love like dope, put me in your veins
I wanna knock your block off, get my rocks off
Blow your socks off, make sure your g-spot soft
Raw take away the pain
You been mislead, lames buttin' in your lane
I wanna hit it in the worst way, two days
Schemin' on that ass since the first day (you heard mane?)
Yeah, I got a lot in store
Shop on this chauffeur, kings hold the door
I'm on a level worse view, put you in couture
Last Kings, High Denim, 12 Jewels and more
I be the realer
You ain't got to question the realer
Takin' flights, seein' sights
Blowin' Cali in the villa
South of France
I could tell that you need it
Represent the West
Sean raised out in Kingston

[Hook]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way, oh
I'm on my way
Back to your heart
(Your love, your love, your love, your love)
Back to your heart
And all I want is you

[Chorus]
When I miss my baby
I can barely breathe
Do it all, I want you next to me
Cause your love like ecstasy
When I want you closer
You the only drug I need
Even your doctor said to stay away
But your love like ecstasy

[Chorus]
When I miss my baby (when I...)
I can barely breathe (oh no)
Do it all, I want you next to me (next to me)
Cause your love like ecstasy (girl, love)
When I want you closer (girl, I...)
You the only drug I need (girl, my drug)
Even your doctor said to stay away (yeah!)
But your love like ecstasy
