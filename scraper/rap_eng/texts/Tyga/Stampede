Stampede box flow make the beat bleed
Punch tummies cause I'm Young Money’s G.E.D
Queen come work for me or it's back to Burger King
Burglar be hurtin' me, Tim Burton couldn't horror me
All you niggas bumblebees bustin' off these bigger beasts
Eat 'em up, got them niggas on the lumidee
Get ready to rumble afro thunder, hype off a bitch tell her to buy a puzzle
Speak nothing new single comin' sucka’s , girls fuck us keep on my polo’s and black tucka’s
The black chucky you get lumped up or pay money
No play money we cleaned up and called it made money
Hate money burnin' to the scown now its aids money
Lay hundreds on the floor couldn't catch me slippin from it
I be be super on it I could put the house up on it
If you want it come and get it
Better catch up homie, red mustard muscle Ferrari through this jungle yellow seat buckled nice I ain’t slowin down for nothin'
Milf hunter wheres the fresh titty milf motha what would you do for a young black marksummers
Uhmmmmm think about it women Tyga can put my man in your lil' women
Born little coverin it, coverin it with a rubber
I don't trust a bitch see how mother nature is
In the club rainin' big with the lime in my drink n' mix it with the twist
Twist,twist it all up, SHIIIIT you're like fuck this coconut shit but I made half a mill
Talkin coconuts bitch now open up bitch ”excuse my language” I don't speak English two months hint hint , pass ya boy a few mints cause my shit stinks
Yeah, I walk with the sticks burnberrys for hips
Daaaaaaaamn they're like Tyga Tyga gettin' nicer
Or Wayne and Drake probably just ghost writin
Don't like em fuck ya’ll like mike tyson
Feelin just like them but yall the ones doin the fightin
Chunk chunk yump yump bubblegum chew em up hit em up here schoolboy does
Do what the fuck you do partys loose u2′s
Haters eat slick shit throwin mic every loo woof
I'm a transit you carless bitches. Don't even know what rich is
Recession occurred, I was busy in the session forsure with some white girls screamin at all the boys fuck em here comes the stampede ya’ll!
