[Hook: Tyga]
I'mSuper Dupa Fly

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Super Super God
Stupid Stupid High
You Umpa Lumpa High
Why Would I Talk to a Person who's not?
So Hater Please Cut it out Like a Coupon
Ready for the Pawn
Chauffeur I Know I am on
But I'm still in the Hood Like a Boost Mobile Phone
O-hh O-hh my God
I'm so home Crown
Money Got me Speaking in different Languages
My Sean your uhm
Leanin baby
Oh you bust too now
If Nothing I'll See you Around 9
Don't worry about the Job
I Got a Spaceship of Supplies
The Type of Transport you Would Like
But You Need Geico because I'm a Psyco in the Mind
I'm Tyga Man
I'm still in my Ride
300 black le seats make them say Oh my
