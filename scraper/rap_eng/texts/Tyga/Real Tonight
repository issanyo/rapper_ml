(Chorus)
[Lloyd]

It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind
I can make you feel alright, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight
Every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time?
You got a deal huh?
I'm like
Ya I'm for real though
I'm right, It's gettin' real tonight..

(Verse 1)
[Tyga]

My time ticker on tres, fucking all night, midnight sex
She ride like my old bitch, but she already knew that
She feel me even when I'm gone, pillows between her legs, now she comfortable
Extend your back, … when the shit explode, boom
Picture me tied down for life, I flash too bright, picture won’t look right
I need God advice dealing with these ladies mice
Girls like planes on to the next flight

(Chorus)
[Lloyd]

It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind
I can make you feel alright, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight
Every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time?
You got a deal huh?
I'm like
Ya I'm for real though
I'm right, It's gettin' real tonight..

(Verse 2)
[Tyga]

Phone just filled with hoes, conversation goes, back and forth
What you doing? Chilling like Eskimos?
Bet I eat your pussy good like vegetables
Nasty nigga, know you like it though
Freaky ass scorpio she ride me like carnivos
And I'm horny though, sex in the morning though
Hormones got my snowboard going vertical
Vertigo, dizzy on my love boat, heard she got a potty mouth
Watch your ass out with soap
Den we fuck again, she ain't my lover, we just cuddy buddy friends

[Lloyd]

It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind
I can make you feel alright, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight
Every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time?
You got a deal huh?
I'm like
Ya I'm for real though
I'm right, It's gettin' real tonight..
