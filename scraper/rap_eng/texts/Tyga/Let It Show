[Intro]
While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
I won't let it show

[Verse 1- Tyga]
Nigga, welcome to my life
Life feels like I'm running through a red light
Don't believe what the blogs write
Motherfuckers wanna know me so they call me Mike
I'm just chilling, watching the fight
Few friends, fake girls, pour me some ice
Table glass, slippers on, lower the blinds
Never been shy, I just ignore lies
Take a look into Tyga's eyes
I breathe love but inhale the hate bomb
So numb my face gone, I need my space
And I don't do Facebook
Serious, look how my face look
How could a man cry while the crowd looks?
Could you walk with me if I give you my foot?
Didn't think you could..

[Chorus]
While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
I won't let it show

[Verse 2- Tyga]
I don't wanna feel like most rappers feel when they get a deal
Like, "Yeah, I'm bigger than him, he's still local"
Gotta keep it real cause they will go loco
Like, "He ain't ever go through shit we go through"
So I guess now I owe you
No, now I hold you, watch them niggas close to you
Don't compare careers, his and his fools
Acting like I knew you back in middle school
Dropped out, mama said I was a fool
I brought the drop out, now me and mama cool
Told her I won't lose, showed her a Jimmy Choo
She call me son now, tell me she real proud, smiles
Oh what a feeling to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved
I wish I could fly like a dove

[Chorus]
While my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
I won't let it show

[Tyga (speaking)]
Ive learned that people will forget what you say
People will forget what you did or done
But people will never forget how you made them feel
Don't cry because it's over
Smile because it happened

[J Cole]
Cole World, niggas praying for that heat
As the globe twirl gotta stay up on your feet
Before I say it to my girl, I say it to the beat
Then I play it for the world
And they say that shit is deep
My life is changing as we speak
They acting like they never seen a nigga on the beach
I say "peace," hope it ain't no sharks in my water
Then holla at my mama, man she love to see Obama
Do his thing, now look how far niggas done came
They had us on the chains, now we copping bigger chains
I ain't saying that it's smart, old nigga don't trip
But they had with the whips, now we copping bigger whips
Oh shit, wonder how bad will it get before he rise
I'm out here trying to get rich: I survive
And a nigga got God to thank
And I'm still throwing 5 in the tank, nigga COLE!
