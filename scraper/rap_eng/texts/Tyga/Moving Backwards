[Verse 1]
First scene
Producers pointin' like action
As the chain swing
Lettin' shine, no sheen
Just my dream
Turn reality
Well done, they say to me
How flatterin'
I’m just making it work like batteries
Abuse and batter me
But never wanna challenge me
Leave 'em shivering
Lookin' in the mirror, like who can fuck with him?
Young troublesome, that the ladies love!
Packed show at the club, who said wait 'til 21?
Asked who booked, promoter didn’t even look my way
Ha, ok
Party people doin' what I say
Hands in the air pat ya belly that's enough, eh
Just seein' how much I can get away with
Lookin' for a bird to get away with
Fly in my spaceship
Take her back to where I live
Next to God crib
You ain’t never been higher than this

[Hook]
Young hollywood star livin' lavish
Lookin' back what a habit
Everybody like what happened?
Feel like I’m movin' backwards
Tyga please show out for the camera
Now everything's flashing
Sittin' here like what happened?
Feel like I’m movin' backwards

[Verse 2]
Will your friends go
If you had to choose
International we'll be travelling 'til we old and blue
That’s how family do
But what about if they ain't paid they dues
Well I guess I’ll pay for that too
Accountant tellin' me how much I withdrew
In the last past year or two
Ain’t gotta say it so loud, you know
I’m just tryin' to keep my people proud
I’m the one they counting on to bring the members around
I ain’t kiddin' my mind is far from small child
I’m on some Mike Tyson shit up in the first round
Knock ya down
And then I smile
Throw in the towel
I’m so foul
X-rayin' every girl blouse
Forgive me, I’m back calm now
Less energy
Late-ly
I don’t know what’s gotten in to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My heart beats
Echoes into the cold streets
Where nightmares and darkness begin to meet
As I see
Nobody cares about my history
Not even me
Holdin' tight to my rosary
I’m just hoping, someone notice me
Hopefully
Sign a CD
But right now, does it look too shabby, T?
Look down can't even see my feet
Everything's blurry
But now, no more worries for me
Maybe go on Maury
As the rapper that used to be
These days they won't even accept me
Except me
Some Excedrin
To get rid of conception
Drugs are a blessing
To someone with no breakfast, damn
It’s so hard being exited, out
Tryna figure out
What my whole life's been about
Can't even do that right
Will I ever see the light?
We back in the limelight Mike?
