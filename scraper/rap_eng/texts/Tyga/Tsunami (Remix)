[Verse 1: Tyga]
Look up, it's me in the sky
A king, a pharaoh, a beast is alive
You all in my space, you gettin' too close just lookin' to fuck up my vibe
I came with some models, they on the front page
Just business, and bullshit aside
So please keep your nose in your business
And the bullshit all out of mine
Real figure and figures don't lie
I'm a killa just look at my life
I gave you a lot to aspire, but you'd rather sit and type bullshit online
Okay I'm done with this shit
At your party and shit, we's getting high
Tropic your ocean, you boastin', you bold
I'll really show you 'bout crime
My day goes, go on ho
You A-holes just hate though
I celebrate to champagne in Tokyo
Ooh I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I did it
Last king on the finish
If time is money, these bitches gon' have to start payin' for all of my minutes

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Look up, it's me in the sky
A king, a pharaoh, a beast is alive
I'm high as Rasta, you an imposter
I just imported my ride
SLR I bought in Milan
Versace, I did it all now
I post it a lot, I post it a lot, she post on my jock it's cause
Times, times, time my Rollie price, don't fuck up my vibe
I go so hard knock out these lines
They copy and post in on Vine
Who you entitled to
Too many love for you
I don't want cuff for you
I just want tongue in you
Party have fun with you
This I'm supposed to do
Touch you and change your life
You A-holes just hate though (2x)
I celebrate to champagne in Tokyo (Tokyo)
Champagne in Tokyo (Tokyo)
I celebrate to champagne in Tokyo (Tokyo)
