(Verse 1)
Walk up on this bitch with a hundred grand
Two rollies on my arm, another hundred grand
Bitch, let the money burn, nigga no tan
Got a young bitch, fucking doing what she can she can!
Pop killa King Kong killa’
T-Raw the real deal thrilla in Manila
Make a bitch pop (pop)
Pills ’till it’s dinna’
She a fucking nympho, that’s why I fuck with her
Whistle while you twerk pussy singers all up in the club throwing up middle fingers
If you try snitch turn a bitch to a hanger
Lay your shit out, now you’re planking, you’re planking
I’m saying!

(Hook)
One two and the bitch came
Break a bitch heart pouring out the champagne
Why you over there chilling with the little lames?
You ain't know, you ain't know that my shit bang?
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
One two and the bitch came
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
Pop pop pop
Pop it bitch
All these hoes know my damn name

(Verse 2)
She don’t give brain, that’s a damn shame
I don’t find the shit funny like soul plane
Put ice on my wrist like the shit sprained
I’m just riding around getting it...two chains
Last King, Y.M.C.M gang
Everything dope bitch where the Novocain
Bitchs saying I’m the bomb, oh man
Blow the pussy up, heir to the sex game!
Roll 8, make them bitches bend they back for laxed she gonna spaz
Make a scene like she act
Act stupid take a cab, oh you broke, oh your bad?
I don’t cuff hoes they just follow my command
I’m saying

(hook)

Lift that ass up, up
And bring that ass down, down
Bring that ass up, up
Shake that ass to the ground

(Hook)
