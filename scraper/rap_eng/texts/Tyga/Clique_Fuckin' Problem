[Hook]
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with my clique
Clique, clique, clique clique
I’m T-Raww young nigga I’m the shit
Shit, shit, shit, shit
I said ain’t nobody fuckin’ with my clique
Clique, clique, clique clique
Young money motherfucker we the shit
I be the shit, we be the shit, I am the shit

[Verse 1: Tyga]
I ball out like the San Diego Padres
TGIF, thank God it’s Friday
Smokey Friday, so high might fly away
Competition’s small so I live big like Tom Hanks
Big bang, 22, nigga don’t believe in caine
Tried everything from sellin’ weed to counterfeit
Counterclockwise, clockwise
Now we countin’ hits
Superfreak bitches made a milli off a porno flick
Good nigga, clean dick
Fuck her right she’ll call again
I ain’t got time for modelin’
Show up lookin’ how your pictures did
Bitch, no call to niggas, but we at the Ritz
Super duper fly nigga so they bug me for a flick
Get it? Flick, flick, choppers on the hip
Make a band, chop a drum clip, I’m T.I. with this
Too ill to reheal or fix son a nigga eclipse
Hotter than Middle East is, pledge allegiance
A star bitch you the realest, I’m a realist
Father, son, holy spirit
‘cause I brought the ghost with me
Let’s toast to the Rolls I driven
You could live in
She give me clit and my clique winnin’
Bank murder up in this

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I got a fuckin’ problem
Baby on me like a toddler
Keep my phone on silent
Vibrate, make that ass shake like a violin
College girls on me while you pressed like dialing
I been everywhere you niggas ain’t
Can’t go where your bitch go, got her up late
Make my dick plank, she gon’ drink it straight
Rotate, let her friend taste
She from the DMV but I ain’t tryin’ to wait
DC, Maryland, them phones they be wirin’ them
Shout out my nigga Wale we be fly like a terrorist
Get money like inheritance
That pussy I’mma wear it out
Yeah we in the strip club
Blowin’ money, air it out
Talkin’ big shit
Let me show you what I’m talkin’ ‘bout
Stacks for the freak show
Told her bring the circus out
I ain’t gettin’ married ‘cause these hoes
They just go around
Ridin’ on the next clique soon as they up in town
Cause I’m the nigga, the nigga nigga
They hold me down if it’s drama
And if it’s drama, I got that loud
Told my girl, Jeffrey Dahmer, and eat her out
Then I follow, and then I follow, dick in her mouth
They say Tyga only got like one hit
Shit, at least a nigga got a hit
Banana make her pussy split
Pornstar, loose lips
Ain’t no room in my circle like a hula-hoop is
Bitch

Groupie ass nigga…
