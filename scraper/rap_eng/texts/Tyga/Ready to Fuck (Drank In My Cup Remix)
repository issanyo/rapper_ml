Yo!

Girls legs I split
With this Hatchet I'll hit
Techs and Juggs in the mix
She want good dick, I got her fix
Lotta sweat it drips
Got my hands on her hips
When I dip she dips
My semen it's like she sips
Kissin' up on her lips
She likin' how we do it
Montell Jordan how I kick
Gymnast the landin' she stick
Her pussy I lick
Cannon like Nick
Over you it's me she pick

[Hook - Tyga]
She said, "Why you fucking everybody?"
I said, "Baby I be only fucking you"
She said, "Don't be fucking with nobody
I want you to myself and I want you, too"
So you know what I said
Just get on the bed

Your toes and your thighs shaking
