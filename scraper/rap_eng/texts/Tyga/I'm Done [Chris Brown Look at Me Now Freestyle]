[Intro]
How y'all gon' hate on me in the club?
Nigga I ain't even in the club

Kill a nigga, last king roll up on ‘em in a Bentley
Mothafucka, gorilla, go getter, ho getter
Ho nigga better hold your nigga
I’m sick, throw up, throw up this liquor
Mo’ money I got it
Bitches ain’t problems, not to me

Shit in my closet, Louboutin and bloody bottoms
Bitches spot em yeah I’m stylin'
Tyga pilot, fly no mileage yeah I put them bitches on it
California man, gold on my license plate
Ladies’ man, baby I know what them bitches like
Little Mike, Mike-n-Ikes, Candy colored cup of ice
Out of sight, out of mind
She gone spend the night but don't wast my time
I'm two miles away from the Hollywood sign
King of the Hill nigga don't look down
Party at Polo house right now
All these bitches on the prowl
Look at my flow, look at my eyes
Tell me what you see, don't lie

Last King, Look at my ring
Tell that bitch to get off my thing
My girl in here and she off that drink

Fur murder swervin’ make the jet ski do a hurdle
Yous a muthafucking turtle, knock you down like Berto
Straps on my sides like Urkle, boy i'll hurt you
Turn your face purple
Niggas wanna talk but yo convo' worthless

Rip these beats then I eat you for dinner
