[Intro]
Yeah, we always go back, back, forth and forth
Yeah, we always go back, back, forth and forth

[Verse 1]
Two missed calls from you, yeah, the party must be over
Every time you go out, yeah, it gets you nowhere
I been waitin' right here, still I been everywhere
And it's like June now, but I love you like February
Tell me about the stories, all lies now yeah
Tell me I don't have to worry about those guys now
I get insecure but I never been insecure before right now
I, I, I, I, I
I'm out my, my, my, my mind
You break me down, you build me up
You take it all, just to fill me up

[Pre-Chorus]
And you do it like you like to hurt me
Is this what you need to feel better?
Is this how you act when you know we're forever?
Yeah and you can come back whenever
This the last time I'm gon' let you, yeah
I know that what I said to you last time
But you cry, I cry, we cry oh yeah
We cry together

[Chorus]
When you cry, I cry
We cry together
When you cry, I cry
We cry together
When I cry, you cry
We cry together
When you cry, I cry
We ride for whatever, yeah

[Verse 2]
On lonely nights, you callin' me, yeah you're callin' me, yeah yeah
But so many days you're ignorin' me, yeah normally, yeah yeah
Now am I talkin' foreign when I say I miss you?
Or maybe your phone was on silent but your phone is always with you
And the one who put tears in your eyes
Is the same one there when they dry
And we haven't touched all night
But your words hit hard when we fight
Ah, ah, ah, yeah I try
We could be good without the byes
Same one who put tears in your eyes
Is the same one there when they dry, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And you do it like you like to hurt me
Is this what you need to feel better?
Is this how you act when you know we're forever?
Yeah and you can come back whenever
This the last time I'm gon' let you, yeah
I know that what I said to you last time
But you cry, I cry, we cry oh yeah
We cry together

[Chorus]
When you cry, I cry
We cry together
When you cry, I cry
We cry together
When I cry, you cry
We cry together
When you cry, I cry
We ride for whatever, yeah

[Outro]
Two missed calls from you, yeah, the party must be over
Every time you go out, yeah, it gets you nowhere
