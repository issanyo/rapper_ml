Don't be scared to bite back
Once I get you wet you can't fight that
Soaking in the sheets hope you got another set
Cos when I'm done guarantee we gon leave a mess
Rubbing on my tatts put this ice on your chest
Sex all night one on one no stress
Uh, get you high when I'm going low
Got the heavy metal shit no rock n roll
Roll you over now I'm licking in your ear lobe
Got that nice and slow, like usher doe
Most women they tempt me to move fast
But Imma make the time stretch like gym class
Bet you never had, keep you coming back
To back, to back, to back
