[Intro: William Beckett and Clinton Sparks]
I'm William Beckett from The Academy Is... and this is the remix of Automatic Eyes from our new album Fast Times At Barrington High. Thank you Alex Suarez

(whoo!)
I know that you like what you're listening to!
Get familiar!
Big shouts out to MTV!
(Your automatic eyes)
The only channel [?]
(Your automatic eyes)
Clinton-Clinton-Clinton Sparks
(Your automatic eyes)
[?]
Automatic, automatic, automatic

[Chorus]
Do you want me to stay
Do you want me to go?
Do you think I recognize
The look on your face when you think that
I know?
Blinded as the shades draw closed
Time’s up for us
Would you want me to go
If you knew what I know?
If you knew what I know

[Verse 1]
Your automatic eyes
Five years disappeared
Five years disappeared that night

[Chorus]
Do you want me to stay
Do you want me to go?
Do you think I recognise
The look on your face when you think that
I know?
Blinded as the shades draw closed
Time’s up for us
Would you want me to go
If you knew what I know?
If you knew what I know

T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-Tyga
Tyga

[Bridge: Tyga]
This verse fresh out the pod
I handle bars like [flouride?]
Staying tall like [?]
Oh, mama, I forgot
The next line cause it's a freestyle
Off the top like he dropped the crown
So bow down cause why would I lie?
Tyga I
Automatic fly
Bless the chain got [red?]
Automatic eye, eye, eye

[Chorus]
Do you want me to stay
Do you want me to go?
Do you think I recognize
The look on your face when you think that
I know?
Blinded as the shades draw closed
Time’s up for us
Would you want me to go
(Get familiar!)
If you knew what I know?
(Hey yo Cassadee, talk to them!)

[Outro: Cassadee Pope]
