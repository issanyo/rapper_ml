[Intro: 2Pac]
I shine and no one else shines, I think everybody shines in different things
I know how to go to that true spot in myself because I'm there everyday
I can be me, I can be whoever because I'm true to me
I can go to neutral easy, a lot of people black, white, mexican, young, old, fat or skinny
Have a problem being true to themselves

[Hook]
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man
Dolla Bill rest in peace

Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man
Dolla Bill rest in peace (rest in peace)

[Verse 1]
Reportin live from a good soul who knew a Roderick
I met Dolla, spirited piece I know you're watchin'
Carried his coffin, dearly departed young artist
Who said it loudly, losing was never a damn option
First met my nigga we was up in Arizona
Told him I got some bitches for you up in California
Never knew May 18th you'd be in California
I swear to God, God go get them niggas homie

Cases only, if they hit and we make bail, we may bail
Then landed up in ATL, club dream [?]
She was like "what's that mean?" (what's that mean?)
Something like a secret society
And I was up the street, I wish you would've called me
Shoutout for T money, the gang ENT
Sending my condolences from Young money GED


[Outro]
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man
Dolla Bill rest in peace [x3]
