Uh
(Young Money) (W-w-well done)

O-Okay it, Okay, okay it's, Okay
It's too many bitches too many niggas hatin'
Red seat racing now my car name Satan
Ray Finkle, you a bitch I got ya girl naked
Chrome heart, hard to love easier to hate me

Okay
Its too many bitches too many niggas hating
Red seat racing now my car name Satan
Ray Finkle, you a bitch I got ya girl naked
Chrome heart, hard to love, easier to hate me
I fucking hate clowns kill em like Jason
Burner, yea I Pack-trick like Swayze
Crazy cash bank roll roll cookoo mani
I rep California but not like Katy
Peary Middle school ghetto girls used to chase me
Now I’m big now they weigh me on the Richter Scale baby
Put ya hands down fuck opponents and opinions
All the girls love me wrap my dick up with a ribbon
Yeah I'm on it when it's business when I'm chillin' you can kick it
And my shoes are armadillos Louis Vuitton’n on you niggas
Spizzikes, J's Air walkin' on the flizzite
Gettin’ head tight when ya high off in the Skizzye
Attendants say I'm tripping
You don’t hear the captain speaking?
I ball all week bitch you barely get weekends
Every show sold, promoted on Twitter
Fresher than a baby got her standing the acrylic
Souvenir this motherfucker high school yea they did it
Best dressed ahhwww, niggas ain’t ahhhww shit to me
Dear Lord bring the Epiphany
Then let it rain hell flames on my enemies
Don’t, be gettin' caught where you shouldn’t be
Everything ain’t a house party with the silly strings
Beat the b-b-beat to the white meat
You niggas can't see me, like mice feet
Head sprung one dose of me’ll have your mind gone
Chase it with some blue Ciroc now you in the cyclone
Lost in the ozone ain’t you baby
100 things to do before you die let me show you baby
Gotta watch ya back these days
Count a million in ya faces spend it in a day
G-(Gotta) watch ya (back these) days
Count a million dollars then I (spend it in your face nigga)
