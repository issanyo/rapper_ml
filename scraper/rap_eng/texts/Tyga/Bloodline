[Pre-Hook]
Have not betrayed your ideals
Your ideals betrayed you
Your eyes will not close
What are you gonna do?

[Hook]
Why blood wanna take mine?
Tell cuz won't take mine
I'm just tryna make way for my bloodline
Gotta make a way for my bloodline
So make way, nigga, in due time
Paid dues and I'm due mine
Tryna make way for my bloodline
Stained blood through my bloodline
So why cuz wanna take mine?
Why blood wanna take mine?
Tryna make way for my bloodline
Gotta make a way for my bloodline
So make way, nigga, in due time
Paid dues and I'm due mine
Tryna make way for my bloodline
Stained blood through my bloodline

[Verse 1]
They said it's racist, black on black faces
Can't portray a nigga when you're called it daily
Days I've dreamt, defeated diplomatic immunity
Ain't shit safe, livin' in a gated community
I put miles on this hooptie, my heroine's tookie
Never seen real life like a gangster movie
Though we kept that Uzi, black gators, we're movin'
Like pharaohs in tombs, bitch, I'm back in tune, bitch
Black out the room, we birthed into this
Who is this new nigga? Who is the proven?
Hundred percent real, no silicone music
I don't do it for you niggas, I just do it to do it
Years ago I swear I was Prince Zamunda
Now I'm King T Ruler
Never know when you're winnin' 'til you start losin'
Can't lose it

[Pre-Hook]
Have not betrayed your ideals
Your ideals betrayed you
Your eyes will not close
What are you gonna do?

[Hook]
Why cuz wanna take mine?
Why blood wanna take mine?
I'm just tryna make way for my bloodline
Gotta make a way for my bloodline
So make way, nigga, in due time
Paid dues and I'm due mine
Tryna make way for my bloodline
Stained blood through my bloodline
Why blood wanna take mine?
Tell cuz won't take mine
Tryna make way for my bloodline
Gotta make a way for my bloodline
So make way, nigga, in due time
Paid dues and I'm due mine
Tryna make way for my bloodline
Stained blood through my bloodline
(What are you gonna do?)

[Verse 2]
I'm King Ramses of my era
Pacin' everlastin' love, couldn't take me this far
But still my heart racin' to new life and past relations
I'm on deck, Last King, standin' formation
Take a look at your life 'fore you judge mine
Middle finger high, fuck a peace sign
Please give me somethin' to write about, it's been too long
23 years behind bars, no father, shoulder to lean on
No love lost, just cold found
I just... wanna see wealth and my family smile
Wanna pass a better generation down
Cosigned since a child, let him make his way down
A man who they praise now, gon' kneel down, say a prayer loud
I'm here, niggas actin' like I had invitations
Like a nigga just slept, woke up in a mansion and shit
Like a nigga in the club all night dancin' and shit
Like the Jamie Foxx Show, bitches actin' fancy and shit
Shit... if I could I would, my nigga
Right now I'm just focused, livin' good, my nigga
All that shit on TV lookin' good, my nigga
Shit, you doin' your thing, as you should, my nigga
As you should, my nigga

[Outro]
Keep doin' your thing
I see you
Just take it day by day
Can't take this shit when you leave
Only thing you leave behind is your bloodline
Keep doin' your thing, my nigga
As you should, my nigga
As you should, my nigga
