[Verse 1]
Sneak peek through the window pane
These girls all aboard, this Young Money train
Having since fame shit'll never be the same
The world want a show, so I'ma be the stage
Dim the lights, listen to what I'm gon' say
Got a fanbase nigga fuck what a hater say
They sleep all day, I'm up early though
Scrolling through the phone, watching videos
Not much competition though
I mean of course just the same old
Bitches in plain clothes
Playing the same roles
Rentals of Lambos
Bend over bitch getting one you know how game goes
Shame on all these models
But I'ma still buy all these bottles
You got a lot to learn young man
Life is your only friend, one day you'll understand

[Chorus]
If I ever get the chance to say hi
Probably wave goodbye at the same time
They say I'm movin' too fast (they say I'm movin' too fast)
Couple good drinks Patrón with the ice
Come to my suite baby you could spend the night
They say I'm movin' too fast (she said I'm movin' too fast)
(So slow it down)

[Verse 2]
Yall be gossipin' more than the barber shop
Walked up in the shop, everybody lookin' shocked
Why all the talkin' stop?
Maybe because I was the one being talked about
Lookin' at your face, I can tell you don't know what this money 'bout
Four accounts can't bounce nigga check the amount
I took a pill getting drowsy now
Gotta finish this verse, can't write it down
Early flight now I'm out of town
Freakin' out all I see is clouds
Hawaii lookin' nice, man
Why every time I leave LA it's an earthquake?
Why every time I leave home bitches thirsty?
Saying she be with a nigga all night
Telling her friends I'm the only girls that he like
You got a lot to learn young man
To all your loyal fans, I hope they understand

[Chorus]
If I ever get the chance to say hi
Probably wave goodbye at the same time
They say I'm movin' too fast (they say I'm movin' too fast)
Couple good drinks Patrón with the ice
Come to my suite baby you could spend the night
They say I'm movin' too fast (she said I'm movin' too fast)
(So slow it down)
