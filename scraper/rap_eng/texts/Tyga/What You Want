[Verse 1: Tyga]
So what they want from a nigga
Rose on 4's,  yeah Raw in this bitch
Ice game, big figures
My day one niggas, we getting bitches
Downing all this Henney, wonder why a nigga tripping?
Enemies distant
You washed up, dry dishes

You can scream if you want to
Dream if you want to

Try to beam if you want to
Get you a ring cause I want to
There ain't nothing I won't do for you
Leave all these other girls alone just for you
So every night I'm coming home just for you
Ain't nothing more you can do to me

Ooh, Ooh, Girl keep shaking them hips for me
Ooh, Ooh, Girl keep biting your lips

[Hook]
