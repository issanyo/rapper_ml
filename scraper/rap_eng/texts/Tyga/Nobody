[Intro]
Yeah, and they already know me S-A-G-E
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Uh

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]
What your ex worried about me for
Why your ex worry about what we drove
Hop out the Kobe,  in the door, you know the sweet road
Tossed the keys to the valley, but really, it ain’t a key hole
And I know how to treat you, there’s no guilty conscience
Haters be trying to kill the love, we can respond it
I see your halo, our connection lego
Take a trip, man, take you show you how a foreign day go

[Verse 2: Anjali]
I don’t care about what the people say
Always talking bout what we do each day
But I know that I’m the one, cause I hold you down
The only one, only one, yeah

[Chorus: Anjali]
Our love's real, I’m not that deal
You go hard for me, that’s how I feel
All I want is you, all I need it you
And your love I can’t deny, cause you’re my number one boy
Nobody, Nobody, Can come between me and you
Nobody, Nobody, Can come between me and you
Nobody, Nobody, Can come between me and you
Nobody, Nobody, Can come between me and you

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ha
What they be talking
If it ain't about deposits, I don’t even want to hear about it
Wide body, all black Forgiatos
Model for me, campaign Presidential
You got that good mmh, locked down
Thrown off a pizzle, got your face in the pillow
I'm dripping, mink dragging as I dribble
That nina ball harder than the pippin
So blessed, guess that’s religion
You with me, time ticking, spent the rollie on it
She got my name tatted on it
Feel like heaven don’t it, Raw Daddy
I do it way different, baby, you can ask about me
Oh, oh, party with a star babe
That brown sugar love, that’s anihilating
I ain’t tripping bout your ex, cause you're mine babe
Got my mind made up, so I ain’t worried about them
No

[Chorus: Anjali]
Our love's real, I’m not that deal
You go hard for me, that’s how I feel
All I want is you, all I need it you
And your love I can’t deny, cause you’re my number one boy
Nobody, Nobody, Can come between me and you
Nobody, Nobody, Can come between me and you
Nobody, Nobody, Can come between me and you
Nobody, Nobody, Can come between me and you
