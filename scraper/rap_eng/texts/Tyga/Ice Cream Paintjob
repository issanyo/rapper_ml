[Freestyle]
Sting beats like bee-hives
Beats like these
Don't get caught on that East-side
L.A. in my G ride, A.C. on the dash
Black flame make my seat hot
On my way from picking cash
I ran into my ex
Best sex I ever had
Don't laugh
But that pussy fuck around and pass gas
Haha, quack quack, now duck-duck that ass
Shane baby (yeah)
Tyga man you know the name baby (uh-huh)
Money ain't a thing
To the Young Money gang baby
Our navy, our ate and leave and rape your lady
Or maybe take more whores, show me your titty
Uh, twenty town here I come
I coulda went lyrical on this beat but I don't
I won't cause you niggas do anything for a joke
L.M.A.O. to the bank I go (gone)
