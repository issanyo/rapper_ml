[Intro-Ca$hma$e]
BlaQ $now
Ca$hma$e
Cha-chinggggg

[Verse 1-Ca$hma$e]
I’m poppin’ Gold Wraps and they poppin’ Durex
I got a Magnum lifestyle and she wanna blow it
Uncircumcised papers now it’s time to roll it
We takin’ hoes to the hotel
We smashin’ in hotel
And if you kick a bitch out then you gon’ make that ho tell
Well, take that bitch to a motel
Make that booty quake like you ridin’ on her coattail
Now make that ass clap, make that ass clap
It’s no homo cuz you know she got a Brokeback
Low tats, big racks, time to motorboat that
Gave her hole in one cuz she know I wanna stroke that
Other bitch grindin’ on the pole for some mo’ cash

[Hook-Tyga]
Got my other bitch fuckin’ wit my other bitch
Got my other bitch fuckin’ wit my other bitch
Got my other bitch fuckin’ wit my other bitch
Fuckin’ all night nigga we ain’t celibate
Got my other bitch fuckin’ wit my other bitch
Got my other bitch fuckin’ wit my other bitch
Got my other bitch fuckin’ wit my other bitch
Fuckin’ all night nigga we ain’t celibate

[Verse 2-Tactic$]
I’m goin’ Hulk on that pussy beat it up like I got a grudge
2 on 1 in the room just the 3 of us
Got em’ pipe dreamin’, fiendin’ like they needin’ drugs
Pussy need a buzz guess my dick is gonna be the plug
Charged up, I’m a start em’ both up
Pardon my French, I’m bout’ to bang 2 sluts
Lookin’ brand new, but they told me use us
Two dominant bitches, bet they leave me bruised up
Choose up, I found em’ in the club
Said I got that X if ya into takin’ drugs
Only into havin’ sex I ain’t into makin’ love
So come give me a hug if you into getting’ rubbed
What’s up?

[Hook-Tyga]

[Verse 3-Ca$hma$e]
While my main bitch fuckin’ with my other bitch
Got another bitch fuckin’ with my other bitch
Got a girlfriend on the side niggas tryna snitch
So while they free fuckin’ hoes I’m a sell a bit
What, what sell a bit, that results, hella dick
Call her Kim K dash Jersey Chasin’ Veteran
Ray J sex tape, she gon’ want a settlement
Eatin’ off ya jersey like Made in China hemmin’ it

[Verse 4-Tactic$]
Hemmin’ it and both of em’ givin’ fucks like a sentiment
They boyfriends textin’ em and both of em neglectin’ em
I told em both go da-da-down like a sedative
I’m diggin’ all night I think I found where the treasure is
