[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, a 100 thou, 3 kilos, my chain is illegal
My life a Tarantino, tomorrow you in the sequel
It's big dollars fucking with this big screen
Shit done got crazy on the side lately, tell her don't scream
Kick it like dojo, know you used to the finer things
Raised from good homes, imagine how that pussy leak
Hood Mona Lis', model for me in that lingerie
Diamonds covered rosary, say a prayer then I eat
Downtown penthouse, see the city sleep
All six bitches still high from last week
Back at it, the routine is automatic
They love my aesthetics, I love they ass clapping
It's all sex, we do it the best on the west
They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
SLR ordered, that bitch coming tomorrow
King shit, them red robes, what you think you out here for? So come on

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I see you working that baby
You need to bring your ass to the Westside
Tonight we tryna freak some
Bring a friend, bring a friend, it's a threesome, yeah
So tell me girl what you drink?
We gon' have a good time
It's a party, oh yeah girl, it's a party
So bring your ass to the Westside

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Look, Virginia nigga on a California king size
Pull your panties to the left, let a G slide
Bonnie & Clyde, ride or die, that's what you need right?
Her daddy OG, she grew up on the East Side
Bumping and humping like it's nothing, feel like a assmatic
69 her favourite, that's simple mathematics
And she can tell by my eyes I love that ass-clapping
A nigga looking surprised, she got my name tatted
She a fan, fuck any nigga affiliated
Went from drug dealing to sports, this bitch don' graduated
But I deal with her, and let her think she made it
I'mma spend it all, shit I'm just playing baby
A 100k for the strippers, just me and my niggas
After that we party with bitches and sipping on liquor
Inhalate them niggas, let them tats fly
Shit, that's how we do it on the Westside, ha, oh yeah

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I see you working that baby
You need to bring your ass to the Westside
Tonight we tryna freak some
Bring a friend, bring a friend, it's a threesome, yeah
So tell me girl what you drink?
We gon' have a good time
It's a party, oh yeah girl, it's a party
So bring your ass to the Westside

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
If you ready, just give me a sign, girl
Cause that body looks amazing, girl
And I'm ready to give you the time of your life, baby
I think you deserve a change
Girl I'm falling in love tonight, my hand up your thigh
I see you don't give a fuck tonight, girl show you right
Let's not waste our time, like it's a 9 to 5
Me and you, both together, getting freaky on the Westside, and girl I see you

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I see you working that baby
You need to bring your ass to the Westside
Tonight we tryna freak some
Bring a friend, bring a friend, it's a threesome, yeah
So tell me girl what you drink?
We gon' have a good time
It's a party, oh yeah girl, it's a party
So bring your ass to the Westside
