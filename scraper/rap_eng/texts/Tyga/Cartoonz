[Tyga: Intro]
T-Y-G-A
Zippin, dippin' jabs super fast in a flash it's Tygaman, Tygaman
Tatted up on my mask, superhero for the cash it's Tygaman, Tygaman

[Tyga: Hook]
My life is - My life is like a cartoon y'all
More crazier than shh you ever saw
I fume to the left and fume to the right and
Then I'm g-g-g-g-gone

[Tyga: Verse 1]
Meet me - the Looney tune, 17, from the CPT
Ed, Edd, and Eddy couldn't beat me in more D's
Roll 22's on the whip, they call them Fantastic Fours and shh
Whoa, I'm sick
Introducing, Billy the kid
Space jammin' with Banana's in Pajamas
No homo (Haha)
Excuse my manners
I go from Hulk to David Banner (Errr)
Land of bandannas
They Yosemite Sam Ya
Ya, Fugazi like
Two stupid dogs talkin' as they walkin'
I couldn't believe that shh
Oops I almost slipped
Porkey pig dollar bills, plus Tweety Bird sits on my wrist (Canary)
Man - Warning, you'll get booked like ORBITZ
Your corpses will be with Yogi in the forest (Bye)
Quick reminder, on short notice
I got the swag potion
Take a sip until you're no longer sober

[Hook]

[Tyga: Verse 2]
Stand down - We have a man down
I Tasmanian devil in my bezel
The ice so heavy bam bam couldn't lift my pebbles
The Flintstones say the stones make you flint as you stare in it (I can't see it)
Ridiculous bright
With a little glare in it
The light beams off it like the Power Puff Girls who stare at it
My spaceship come equipped with a Jetson engine
To The Milky Way I'm dippin'
Bravo, Johnny says "We're space pimpin'"
With the Huh-Huh-Ha, I always get 'em
The grill lookin' OJish but not Simpson
I'm more like blue and yellow mixed: Marge Simpson
You lil' countin' chickens
Scooby Doo can't even figure out what Tyga's missin'
Maybe nothin', there's gotta be something
To rap he's like carrots to Bugs Bunny
With cash I'm the Energizer Bunny
Long money
