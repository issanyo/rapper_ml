[Verse 1]
Young light skinned, born ??
Since I was 10 probably name all the trouble I did
Neva participated, I'm like "fuck all them other kids"
Like I don't owe you child shit when I make it big
But a little respect, fuck y'all though what do you expect
Never raised a gentlemen like Ne-Yo said
Lookin for hero heads, but I don't see none yet
All my friends, weed & cigarettes so I take a hit
*cough cough*, That's some potent shit oh there go police man
I ain't scared of shit, but hell yeah I ran
Lost my money clip ever since wrap rubberbands
Biggity bam, did a couple of scams, made a couple of grands
Fast forward to the Ford Escort, I ball with it
Too quick 14 no license, that's some awful full shit
Now must stack ketchup like condiments
Kinda just wish you taught me how to be a man

[Hook]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me & mom alone every dinner
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
If I sent my dad letters
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter

[Verse 2]
Word is, 10th grade kick out the crib
Like where I go from here, lucky I had a girlfriend
Remember money make the world spin
Runnin around the big body benz wonderin who in this
Thats pedestrian, spoiled kid, never that
Worked too hard to get where I'm at, thinking fuck school
But next semester I be back, I hated rules
But ruling the world I often dream of that, dream of meetin you dad
Moms really getting mad when I call you that
I don't understand , your phone numbers all I ask
She laughs with her jaw dropped like the movie Mask
Damn so I then reply resort to raising my own little man
But I'm too young for that, wait I take that back
I shoulda used the hat, my girl gettin fat
Whatever results make sure that
I'll be there like you wasn't dad

[Hook]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure
Me & mom alone every dinner
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
If I sent my dad letters
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter

[Verse 3]
Double 09 lately really its been on my mind
The pain eatin me alive one verse at a time
And this heart problem ain't helpin at all
Its a cardiac diagnose, just wanna stay at home
Dying slow so I bought a fast car, and a couple of charms
Now family and old friends wanna be involved
Some nigga tryna marry mom he like my songs
I find it odd sometimes wanna fucking shoot his head off
Am in the wrong, didn't think so moving on
Im working on my new album if you singing songs
But rap is what I does, turnin 20 soon
Then 21 then 22 like Emmitt was
Everybody sleeping on me time to wake em up
(wake, wake, wake em up, wake, wake, wake em up)
Now everybody chasing us like they missed the bus
And girls wanna roll like a blunt, P.S. your only son

[Hook]
Growin up all I wanted was a father figure

One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
If I sent my dad letters
This what it sound like if I sent my dad letters
One day I hope you hear this I pray you doin better
This what it sound like if I sent my dad a letter
