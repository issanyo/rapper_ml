[Chorus: Kanye West]
She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
She under the influence
She rich nigga drunk
A broke nigga text her
She roll her eyes like, "What this nigga want?"
She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'

[Verse 1: Tyga]
She under my influence, she rich nigga drunk
All you got is chump change 'cause you been with a chump
You should be on Punk 'cause you been with a punk
I been ballin' all year, yeah, he been in a slump
Let's spend a weekend in the TRUMP, we can get rich nigga drunk
Drink up everything in the minibar, to make you call to fill it up
Yeah, that's that rich nigga drunk, she say she sick of gettin' up
8am, tryna wake up kids, barely got time to fix her lunch
We'll come get rich nigga drunk, kiss my dick, kiss it once
Okay, just one kiss, this time with a little tongue
Woo, she rich nigga drunk, gon' let a rich nigga fuck
Said she never been a quitter, but she finna give it up, agh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
She under the influence, she rich nigga drunk
A broke nigga text her, she roll her eyes like, "What this nigga want?"
She under the influence
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'
Keep doin' what you been doin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
