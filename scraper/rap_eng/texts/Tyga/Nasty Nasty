[Intro: Girl]
You's a nasty, uh, nasty, uh, nasty nigga

[Verse 1: Tyga]
She ride it, she top me, she freaky, she bout it
She crazy, she violent, she dripping, it's fountain, I smack it
She pull it, she bite it, no scratching, it's target
Practice, keep a ratchet
Tap out when I tap it
Crossed like a Catholic
Diamonds all in my fabric
These niggas is so average
I'm all in my peas and carrots
Ain't thinking about no marriage
You livin' vicariously through me bitch why you starin'
Damn, I fucked some thot hoes
But I gotta keep that on the low
Them screenshots be ammo
Just blew my load wearing Rambo
The grant game told her sip slow
Wildin' chain in this Vietraw
Her head strong, hedgehog
Hell yea, I blew her head off
Feds watchin' so I sped off
Crawl back to me cut the legs off
Broke is a joke wipe the smirk off
I don't drink no Smirnoff
You niggas shop at the surplus
Boss up get your dollars up
Fuck her once I don't follow up

[Hook: Girl & (Tyga)]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I'm a nasty nigga
She love nasty niggas
All of that ass in my face
Don't feel bad my nigga
Fuckin with no brakes
Crash in the pillows
All of my beach they bang, I cum on the instrumental
Do it my dirt is simple
Pull up on a thot
Flexin' on my ops
Hittin that milly rock
Hot boy in the hot
Glaciers all in my watch
Making her best friend watch
I might, might go live
I got, no time, bitch, ride it like you don't drive
Hop up on your good foot, spit on it, shoeshine
In the booth, I go caboose if the track fire
I end that, flatline, rotate hoes like spare tires
Five flames, but the heatwave, car painted and the feet suede
In the strip club, I go, T-Pain
Stay in your lane, cause heat lane
I'm the nigga that can't be traced
Spray in your face, no face paint
Your baby mama always say

[Hook: Girl & (Tyga)]

You's a nasty, uh, nasty, uh, nasty nigga, augh
