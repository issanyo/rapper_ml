Love (hate)
Niggas (hate)
Bitches (hate)
Me (I can't)
Faded I might (faint)
Faded I might (faint)
My mind went (blank)
Mind went (blank)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Now I done grew around some niggas that caused me some drama
Swear when you make it niggas say you owe them
Swear they think they your momma
Everybody with their hands out
They always ask me, they know that I got it
My biggest fear is going broke
Can't say no, that's my problem
I wanted that Rolls-Royce
Young boy looking to make a bad choice
Then it got fucked up when mom went to jail
I heard a little voice
Back of my head, Back of my mind
Dropped out of school but a nigga did fine
I ain't telling you to drop out, but if you do make use of your time

[Hook]
I said why they hating on me I'm just trying to get my guap
I'm just trying to set my family up
First: believe in one God then stack your paper higher (bish)
Get your money, stack your paper higher (bitch)
We ain't ever fuck with cops, and that's never gonna stop
And I'm posted at the tippy-top
So get your money fast then stack your paper higher (bish)
Get your money, stack your paper higher (bitch)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ok
I'm taking my time, and taking your dinner
(These Bitches) these bitches cold blooded like winter
I'm looking at fixtures that I don't remember
I'm all in my zone, Karl Malone
Taking these shots, abusing my liver
It's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I'm gon' spend it
(Aughhh!)
Doomsday, Doom's date
These niggas weak like it's a tuesday
Niggas get loony like a toon stay
Everything well done, like two steaks
Who they? ain't from L.A
They fall off like November days
They worry bout your sales
But, at the end the day, who getting paid?
