[Verse 1: Tyga]
Kill a nigga, last king roll up on em in a Bentley
Mothafucka, gorilla, go-getter, ho-getter
Ho nigga better hold your nigga
I’m sick, throw up, throw up this liquor
More money, I got it
Bitches ain’t problems, not to me
Yeah they bought it, Master P
So many albums on release
Shit in my closet, Louboutin and bloody bottoms
Bitches spot em, yeah I’m styling
Tyga pilot, fly no mileage
Yeah I put them bitches on it
California man, gold on my license plate
Ladies’ man, baby I know what them bitches like

[Hook]
Little mic, Mike-n-Ikes, candy color cover ice
Out of sight, out of mind
She gonna spend the night but don’t waste my time
I’m two miles away from the Hollywood sign
King of the Hill, nigga don’t look down
Probably at Polo House right now
All these bitches on the prowl

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Look at my flow look at my eyes
Tell me what you see don’t lie
Motherfucking G R to the E A to the T E-S-T
Last king, look at my ring
Tell that bitch get off my thing
My girl ain’t here and she off that drank
I’m off that mink
Fur murder swerving make the jet ski do a hurdle
You’s a motherfucking turtle
Knock you down like a hurdle
Straps on my side like Urkel, boy I’ll hurt you
Turn your face purple
Niggas wanna talk but your convo worthless
These converse yeah all black Chuckers
I’m that nigga, you just a nigga
One more year, yeah I’ma be bigger
Don’t call me Tigga, Jack the Ripper
Rip these beats then I eat you for dinner
I’m done
