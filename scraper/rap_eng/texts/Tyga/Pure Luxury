[Verse 1]
Old fucking drama, call the karma kamikaze
Shots of alcohol the pain its relic in my chest, I feel demolished
Hold the liquor, make it silence, pray into me like the altar
Life is off the loss and coughing I'm just here to make my offer
Crystal sniffing, bitches tripping, luxury and gang members
Wanna be like Boyz N Hood, affiliated by my brothers
Worship higher powers, smokes inpolished, drinking from the chalice
So they say it's his blood be like he was a Jes√∫s
I'm holy, horrors making eye contact
Surviving the thrones, stones at yo front door, bang it though
When a nigga get dough, promise I pay you back mo'
You always had my back and I thank you for that
Wanna call you late, but I'm busy filling plates
Kids gotta eat and mommas gon' cry, that bread been straight, we shaking dank
Baby I'ma save you one day, from this hell hole and gunplay
Grew up with cinco hasta las cinco
Went east side where rain poured and souls cried, no sunshine
Tomorrow when tears dry, no one'll make it out alive
I just wanna make it God, can you hear me fine, here been deaf, feeling blind, all I see is sacrifice (overtime)
Show no remorse when you die, until then
Wash my sins with time, make yo bed (lay on the line)
Looking at headlines, it's all alive on who are you and I to decide, just tryna get by
And that's pure like virgin blood mixed with 1-51 one sip
Make a nigga flip, I ain't tripping off shit
That happened yesterday, cause I just wanna rest today in pure luxury

[Hook]
All my life I wanted luxury
A roof over to sleep
Family, that's luxury
All I ever hung around was G's
Breaking bread with the homies, that's luxury
Something like virgin blood that's pure and she screaming out "Its yours"
All I ever wanted was luxury
Now all I got is luxury, come fuck with me

[Verse 2]
20 bandana, cross my fingers when in danger
I protect you perfect stranger, put that body on a hanger
Her man's in Herman, [?] don't need a fucking filla
Hold my hand, your halo's fading, pesos and Pinot Grigio
Bless the newborns, my comrades they die for me
It's not the game, you just a casualty
War ruins who after me
Surviving, could have been a tragedy
Ninth grade, in a driver seat
Skipping class, no time to speak
Truth be told this honesty
Poker face and poke her highness next to me
I'm soaking royal altercationally
Not complacent, want the cake and cream
Settle in, you just another loyal fee
I don't smoke that reggie seed, high at the presidential suite
And I ain't at the legion seat nigga, overseas
With Sheikhs that's royalty nigga
You can bet that, my tux black
My bitch black and I'm backing out
That ghost black, black MX
Ain't gotta say shit, on the favor

[Hook]
All my life I wanted luxury
A roof over to sleep
Family, that's luxury
All I ever hung around was g's
Breaking bread with the homies, that's luxury
Something like virgin blood that's pure and she screaming out "its yours"
All I ever wanted was luxury
Now all I got is luxury, come fuck with me

[Spoken Outro]
When it all started a couple of months ago
I found that all of my friends were doing it
And I didn't want to feel left out
So, I went out and got one, and it's true what they say
"You'll never forget the first time"
When I put that big face Rollie,
It felt like pure luxury
