[Verse 1: lulu]
Break a nigga's ball socket
Eat a bitch, Hot Pocket
My dick is hard, your balls droppin'
My mind is far and it ain't stoppin'
This ain't tag, if it were, I'm not it
She wanna stay at my place
I say, "Bitch, I show no love"
Break her up, no ligase
She say, "Shvde, fuck my face"
Turn to a fucking high chase
She think I love her, though I'm lie-based
My tracks be not traced
No, bitch, I am not based
Never was that guy, huh
Always gonna lie, fuck
Up, bitch, and just suck dick
Swag is totally dapper
Fuck bitches cause I'm a rapper
Don't fall in love cause I am happier
Hoes are just gettin' sappier
All because I'm rappin' now
And I really just wonder how
A fat motherfucking cow
Don't bow down, instead she just beg for dough
Get out
