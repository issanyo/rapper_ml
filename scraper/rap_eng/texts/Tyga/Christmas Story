[Verse 2: Gata]
Ah the rove street my block
Till I step on it
With all these pieces on my neck I call them custom on-ins
Its the Ice so bright
Like it came with a on switch
Because I'm a on star and I'm ridin with a phantom
No she not ginger but I still got that bread
Man, True bread winner and I'm far to ahead
Man, Look at my Departure
You can't even start it
Your plan ain't shit because you just talk shit
While I shit like a dog shit
Better yet like a hog shit
I'm all in your city and I'm still on my boss shit
Just pick the clusters
But please don't smother because there's chicks near by who are trying to pucker
Up on my dick
These hoes kiss it then lick and its been their routine scene my second genesis
Then the stations came out and I told them hoes to dip
Then I Started flipping words
Getting paid for this shit
