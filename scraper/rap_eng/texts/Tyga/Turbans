[Hook]
Niggas work and work and make you work to live
Don't work, if that don't work, straps of work
Thank god this rap shit work, my niggas chill rap the work
My niggas will go back and forth
Tryin' to pack the work
I'm just tryin' to pack it back to Africa
More stamps in my passport, nigga back to work
Fynna throw the hoodie on like a turban
Shit wasn't sweet when they left me deserted
And now I had a heart but you broke it
And now I had feelings but you hurt 'em
Now I'm turnin' up on everybody, you, you, you, you, you, you, and you
Yeah, I'm turnin' up on everybody, god don't save 'em let me do what I do

[Verse 1]
[Fynna throw the hoodie on like a turban
Niggas get nervous when they seem determined
All black Suburban, boom, boom, boom
