[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
I wanna wake up baby and see you sharing my bed
You roll over start smiling, girl I'mma cook you breakfast, yeah
I gotta say that you got my heart and you're my answer when I'm reaching for the stars, oh
I don't need nobody else but you, oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'ma let you play babe your music in the car
Shawty you're my favourite song
You're my baby, kissing on your neck and I don't even need permission cause your body saying yes and
You know that I want it, girl, so just let me get it, girl
When it's all said and done I'ma make you number one, one, one, one
When it's all said and done I'ma make you number one, one, one, one
When it's all said and done I'ma make you number one, one, one, one, I'mm make you
When it's all said and done, I'ma make you number one

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
