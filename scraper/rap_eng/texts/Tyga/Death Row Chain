My Death Row Chain got a pharaoh face
Medalion you mad we on
Yea daddy home
Little daddy got to put his family on
Told my mama I'm her daddy too
I give my son the sun and the moon
Told my son stay out daddy closet
I got a chopper and it's new
Yea I got a chopper and it's not a toy
Told my boy stay out daddy's room

It ain't safe to play
What I say him I'm a say to you
It ain't safe to play
It ain't safe to play
Safe it ain't
It ain't safe to play
AK by the safe so the safe is safe

My Death Row Chain got pharaoh face 4x
Might go blind staring in his face
My Death Row Chain make her toss it up (I ain't mad at you)
My Death Row Chain come floss with us (Live and Die in Los Angeles)
My Death Row Chain keep talking up (Look for me)
My Death Row Chain at the Vibe Awards
Stab a nigga these diamonds hurt
This ghetto slang my finest work
Million Dollars in the passenger
My Death Row Chain make her back it up
Everyday I look like an album cover
My Death Row Chain going platinum plus
My Death Row Chain got them lapping up
Two seater Benz Puerto Rican twins
Told'em fassen-up
Pulled off fast as fuck
My Death Row Chain keep added up
Two on me then
Three on me now
Four on me now
She like my Death Row Chains on when we fuck

My Death Row Chain got a pharaoh face
Medalion
Yea daddy home
Little daddy got to put his family on
Told my mama I'm daddy too
I give my son the sun and the moon
Told my son stay out daddy closet
I got a chopper and it's new
Yea I got a chopper and it's not a toy
Told my boy stay out daddy's room

It ain't safe to play
What I say him I'm a say to you
It ain't safe to play
It ain't safe to play
Safe it ain't
It ain't safe to play
AK by the safe so the safe is safe

My Death Row Chain got pharaoh face 4x
Might go blind staring in his face
My Death Row Chain make her toss it up (I ain't mad at you)
My Death Row Chain come floss with us (Live and Die in Los Angeles)
My Death Row Chain keep talking up (Look for me)
