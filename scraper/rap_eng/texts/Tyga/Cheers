Audemars, Royal Oak baby
Look up in the sky, I'm a star baby
How could you not want to shine crazy
Hold it up, make a toast baby

Cheers to the weekend
Cheers to the fact
Spending every night like it's never coming back
Cheers to the people in the club to the party
Cheers to the people in the club to the party

Throw your fingers in the air
Flashing lights moving everywhere
Girls in the club
Falling on the floor
I bet they be falling for me
My homies ordering everything they want
Cash cash money
Floating over my zone
Don't worry I've got this under control
That's right!
That's right!
I do it like that

From the evening till the morning
From the morning till the evening
From the ceiling to the floor baby come on & get it

Cheers to the weekend
Cheers to the fact
Spending every night like it's never coming back
Cheers to the people in the club to the party
Cheers to the people in the club to the party

Cheers to the money
Cheers to my ex
Cheers to the future
Cheers to my next
Cheers to the people in the club to the party
Cheers to the people in the club to the party

Let's do this one more time and let's celebrate everything we couldn't
The sun is up but we ain't stoppin'
It's all good

You better raise up to the sky
Think about the road we travelled
I will do this again to show you
How we do

From the evening till the morning
From the morning till the evening
From the ceiling to the floor baby c'mon get it

Cheers to the weekend
Cheers to the fact
Spending every night like it's never coming back
Cheers to the people in the club to the party
Cheers to the people in the club to the party

Can't even hide it

Light it up like it's incense, don't it make sense?
We gon' party 'til the roof cave
Make a toast, one hell of a day
