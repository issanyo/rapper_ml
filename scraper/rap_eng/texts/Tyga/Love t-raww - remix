I don't fuck with nobody, about me
I don't fuck with nobody, about me
I don't fuck with nobody, about me
I don't fuck with nobody, about me
I don't fuck with nobody...

These bitches love T-Raww
Hatin,' need machine guns
All these niggas they broke boys
And I push a Rolls Royce
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww
Only trust my Nina
King shit with my feet up
Kill a nigga with my song, but
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww

Ridin' 'round no plates
Schemin' tryin' to get paid
Lookin' for a fuck date
Men lie, women lie
But not the numbers I make
Load up that Wild Boy
Call it MGK
Mind gone, don't fuck with me
Countin' dorms in the Middle East
38, Silence of the Lambs
Hello Clarice
My life need a DVD
Bags of money like the Money Team
Dress bitches in all black
You could call them BET
These hoes in competition
Competing for a seat in VIP
These niggas claimin' they poppin' bottles
They just holdin' that sparkle thing
Wrist on, I had a dream
Martin Luther I must've seen
Mixtape, mix ya body with tape
That's what that green'll bring

These bitches love T-Raww
Hatin,' need machine guns
All these niggas they broke boys
And I push a Rolls Royce
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww
Only trust my Nina
King shit with my feet up
Kill a nigga with my song, but
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww

Off season, no time to play
Night time, my time of day
I hustle hard like Ace and Wayne
Two shifts, I'mma need a raise
Carpool, stay in your lane
I'm blowin' up, that's propane
These hoes want my last name
No sitcom, this the House of Pain
No I don't fuck with nobody like celibates
I ride alone, I die alone
She give me head, that's Tylenol
No dialogue, she play her part
My life a movie, no script at all
I darn say that I did it all, I did it all, so...

These bitches love T-Raww
Hatin,' need machine guns
All these niggas they broke boys
And I push a Rolls Royce
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww
Only trust my Nina
King shit with my feet up
Kill a nigga with my song, but
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww
