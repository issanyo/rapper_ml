[Verse 1: Justine Skye]
I been knowing you for long enough
Damn I need you right now
You can take your time, don't have to rush
This might take us a while, (yeah)
I left all the doors unlocked and you said you're on your way
When you get here don't just say a word, got no time to play

[Pre-Chorus: Justine Skye]
I know you think that you know me
But you ain't even see my dark side
This is for you only
So baby do me right, do me right

[Chorus: Justine Skye]
We can go all, the time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
Where we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide

[Post-Chorus]
Baby it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (tonight)
Said it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (let's collide)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Wakin' up, she on it
Good love in the mornin'
Get on top my cojones
I pleasure you for the moment
This don't come with no warranty
You want it but can't afford it
My world is different than your's
You're opinion of me is glory
Glorifying in all these foreign
Back to future, and DeLorean
You ain't used to feelin' this important
Cars imported, girls imported
In subordinate, get deported
Baby check, my inventory
Gotta whole lot in store for ya
Birkin bags, purple tags
I can out a whole lot of shit on blast
Vera Wang, Ballinciaga
Baby you ain't never to fly for that
I talk a lot of shit, cause I can back it up
She know I'm the shit, so baby back it up

[Chorus: Justine Skye]
We can go all, the time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
Where we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide

[Post-Chorus]
Baby it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (tonight)
Said it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (let's collide)

[Bridge: Justine Skye]
I know that this is love when we touch boy
You got my heart
And can't nobody make me feel like you do, boy like you do
Cause baby we can go

[Chorus: Justine Skye]
We can go all, the time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
Where we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide

[Post-Chorus]
Baby it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (tonight)
Said it's all yours if you want me, all yours if you want me
Put it down if you want me (let's collide)
