She love my jacuzzi

They love my jacuzzi
Ghetto contour untamed sophisticated ignorance
Never heard nobody, nobody nah nah nah
I make it hot all in my jacuzzi
She love my jacuzzi

They love my jacuzzi
Ghetto contour untamed sophisticated ignorance
Never heard nobody, nobody not

[Verse 1]
I know it's hot and this ice donâ€™t help
Yeah this ice that I got is the kind that don't melt
(Hold on let this shit keep goin')
Yeah I be cooler than I look
My jacuzzi gotta coming back
And everytime I come around, they say the summer's back
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
But are you really? (Are you really?)
Are you really ready? To get hot and sweaty
You already know

[Verse 2]
(Ghetto contour untamed sophisticated ignorance)
She say it's ghetto hot, pull up on her
Hop out and push up on her
In that contour on the showroom floor, I can show you more
And they know we untamed
They hatin' on us and we unfaced
We don't think about in on a Monday
Everyday the week end baby you should and see me
It's sophisticated how I made it
I'm so hot I'm steaming baby
All these diamonds ignorant
I wasn't thinking baby
I be gettin' money now she wanna fuck me suck me
Out in Cali where it's sunny you know

They love my jacuzzi
Ghetto contour untamed sophisticated ignorance
Never heard nobody, nobody not
I make it hot all in my jacuzzi
