[Verse 1:]
I think I'm nauseous
Hey mister, Derrick is it?
You can call me giddy, brain spinnin'
The virus you been missin
Ill, crazy, what's the difference?
No defense can defend
I'm Monte Kiffin, A Buccaneer
These fuckers here, might wanna listen;
Cause there's no recovery from this ill once you get it
Hot head nigga, fever is check my temperature
Tamper with my temper, get this missile to your temple
It's simple lights, no paris hilton
More shit like the toilet's speaking
Regurgitating things I've eaten, poly seeds and jelly beans and shit, mickey d and these demons are fish
Love the sea men, I love fishing
I go like every weekend;
From Monday to Sunday, these weak niggas stay sleeping
Waking that old ass up like black people ringers
Far from a genius
Should've stayed far from them yellow blinkers
Now you're blinking, no idea where you're ID is

[Hook:]
I been around the world
The fact I have to go
You can't fix this
Doc thought I'd let you know
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I been killed, but I always come back for more
I'm here to stay if the NARCs don't let you go
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous

[Verse 2:]
Step in the caution tape
Come around the corner
Coroner is just a call away
Pull board like sandwiches spread flat today
No quick quote, just smoke from the barrel blast for me, against what I have to say
Powerful nigga In position, the president today, 'Bama bitch
If they talking sideways, ladda yippy yapping them hotter
Your not a factor, the son couldn't father if his own taught him
Better park it, for they break your waters like auto insurance
Can I show your life in that bentley baller?
Welcome to Compton!
Check my pockets, all green like the slossin
Don't even count it, it's all there like Peggy lee partner
Facin the faucet, time to drown out the sorrow
How long could you hold your breath for, underwater?
Watch ya turn purplish, ooh, balloons, see ya soon
Don't fall in that fiery doom

[Hook:]
I been around the world
The fact I have to go
You can't fix this
Doc thought I'd let you know
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I been killed, but I always come back for more
I'm here to stay if the narcs don't let you go
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous

[Verse 3:]
Fucking shit
Whatchu thought? You could get rid of me?
I'm poison and you gotta remember me, I'm like history
Socially study gecomedin
I hate being sick, every time I throw up feel like I'm dying quick, blaaghh
Hold up!
Drink this soda, soothe the odor
Turn it to more throw up
I'm tyga man, contagiously god made me
Don't shake my hand, If you afraid of satan, jewelry by jason, that's why they hatin', I'm hot!
Dawg, you ain't nathin

[Hook: x2]
I been around the world
The fact I have to go
You can't fix this
Doc thought I'd let you know
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I been killed, but I always come back for more
I'm here to stay if the narcs don't let you go
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
I'm so sick, I think I'm nauseous, nauseous
