[INTRO: By Tyga]

Love, hate
Niggas, hate
Bitches, hate
Me, I can’t
Faded I might, faint
Faded I might, faint
My mind went, blank
Mind went, blank

[VERSE 1: By Ron The Don]

PROPS TO YOUR FUTURE GHOST WRITER
MOST OF THESE RAPPERS ARE SO UNINSPIRED
YOU DONT KNOW SHIT BOUT THE BUSINESS YOU SHOULD RETIRE
BRUUHHH
MY NICKNAME IS VOLCANO I SPIT THAT FIRE
BRUUHHH
IM SELF EMPLOYED I DONT NEED TO GET HIRED
YOU CLIMBING A CORPORATE LADDER I JUST GET HIGHER
ENDED THE NIGHT WITH a BLUNT AFTER THE REMIX
SPENT THE MORNING INA CUNT SHE GOT ME FIXED
HAD TO HIT CLASS AT LUNCH ALMOST MISSED IT
CAME LIKE 30 MINUTES LATE SHOULD’VE MISSED IT
LAST TIME YOU SEEN ME GIRL YOU SHOULD’VE KISSED ME
AND THAT’S THE RIGHT WAY AROUND GIRL TEST ME
TREAT ME LIKE IT’S THE 21ST CENTURY
I KNOW YOU THAT KIND OF WOMAN
GIRL YOU CAN KILL THEM AND PUT EM IN A CEMATARY
YEAH AND YOU DON’T HAVE TO DOUBT IT GIRL

[HOOK 1; By Ron The Don]

YOU DON'T GOTTA DOUBT IT
I DON'T GOTTA DOUBT IT
BABY WHY YOU GOTTA DOUBT IT
YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT  IT
WHY YOU GOTTA DOUBT IT
YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT  ME
BABY YOU DON'T GOTTA DOUBT IT
I KNOW THAT THEY GOT ME
I DON'T GOTTA DOUBT IT

[BRIDGE 1: By Tyga]

Love, hate
Niggas, hate
Bitches, hate
Me, I can’t
Faded I might, faint
Faded I might, faint
My mind went, blank
Mind went, blank

[BRIDGE 2: By Ron The Don]

My team way too strong
Me and fake ones  don’t  get along
WE DON’T
My team way too strong
Me and fake ones  don’t  get along

[Hook 2 - By Tyga]
I say why they hatin’ on me?
I’m just tryin’ to get my guap
I’m just tryin’ to set my family up
First believe in one God
Then stack your paper higher, bitch
Get your money, stack your paper higher, bitch
We ain’t never fuck with cops
And that’s never gonna stop
And I’m posted at the tippy top
So get your money fast
And stack your paper higher, bitch
Get your money, stack your paper higher, bitch

[VERSE 2: By Ron The Don]
THOU SHALT NOT FUCK AROUND WITH WHAT I'M Channeling
I GOT THE GAME BY THE HORNS I'LL FUCKKING HANDLE IT
AND AFTER THE XO TOXICITY
WILL YOU MISS ME ?
I DONT POP PILLS OR SNIFF SHIT
YOU WONT HAVE TO MISS ME
LOOK ME IN THE EYES YOU CAN SEE THE ITS REAL
IM A SOLDIER FOR LA RAZA IT AINT ABOUT APPEAL
THIS AINT ABOUT NO FUCK SHIT IM TRYING TO MAKE YOU FEEL
IF YOU GON BE BY MY SIDE MAKE SURE YOU GON  BE DOWN TO KILL
IF YOU GON BE BY MY SIDE MAKE SURE  YOU KEEP IT TRILL
ILL KNOW THAT YOU DOWN TO RIDE IF YOU JUST  KEEP IT REAL
I’LL LET YOU BE THE BONNIE TO MY CLYDE EXCEPT WITH MASS APPEAL
EXCEPT WITH SEX APPEAL
AND YOU DON T GOTTA DOUBT IT
TELL ME WHY YOU ALWAYS DOUBT ME
EVEN THOUGH YOU DON T EVEN REALLY GOTTA DOUBT IT?
