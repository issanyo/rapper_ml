[Verse 1: Tyga]
Yeah, so what they want from a nigga?
Rose on fours, yeah, broad in this bitch ice skating big figures
My day one niggas, we gettin' bitches
Downing all this hate and you wonder why a nigga trippin'
Enemies distant, you washed up, dry dishes
Versace in my kitchen, my shit different
Hundred grand, bet it on it, caviar with the jet pilot
I land runway, they light it, world united
Gave her this dick, she gon' like it
Just don't bite it inpolitely
Say she need me like an I.D., but I be outtie
Five thousand, gold Audi

[Verse 2: Pharaoh Jackson]
You are, you are, you are so special to me
I wanna come home to you, I wanna make love to you
But I gotta get this cheese
Girl, I know you like that
Tell me anything you want and I'mma get that for you
Got me thinking I'mma wife that
Your girls and my niggas know that I adore you
Ooh, ooh, girl keep shaking them hips for me (for me)
Ooh, ooh, girl, keep biting them lips

[Hook: Pharoah Jackson]
And I just don't wanna waste your time
(Don't wanna waste your time)
So let them niggas know that you're all mine
You're my wifey
He ain't appreciate so you knew I had to take that
Got a hundred bands on me, yeah
Shake that, girl, I wanna feel your body, yeah
Take that, got a hundred grand on me
Can't fake that, girl, I'm a real OG

[Bridge: Pharoah Jackson]
Girl, what you want from me?
Oh oh, yeah, Iâ€™m out here workin', gettin' this money
Get this money
Girl, what you want from me?
Oh, I'm coming, be there in a hurry
Hurry, be there in a hurry

[Verse 3: Pharoah Jackson]
You can scream if you want to, dream if you want to
Take that Maserati, try the Beam if you want to
Get you a ring cause I want you, you're mine
It ain't nothing that I won't do for you
Leave all these other girls alone just for you
So every night I'm coming home just for you
Ain't nothing more you can prove to me
I love everything that you do to me
Ooh, ooh, girl keep shaking them hips for me
Ooh, ooh, girl, keep biting them lips

[Bridge]

[Outro: Pharoah Jackson]
Take that, shake that
Take that, can't fake that
