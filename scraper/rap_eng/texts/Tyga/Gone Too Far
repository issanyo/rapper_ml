[Hook]
Shit is gone too far, shit's gone too far
Whatever drugs you on, y'all been on too long
Shit's gone too far
And my bitch say she miss me, I've been gone too long
Like bitch I'm only goin' to the store, I'll be back in a minute
Rappers ain't rapped in a minute
Sayin' broke is a joke, I ain't laughed in a minute

[Verse 1]
Ugh, she gonna do it for a promise ring
Pussy every night, remember what you promised me?
You my Grammy, all them other hoes nominees
I was never honest to them other hoes, honestly
Sex in the shower, see you wet and my diamonds clean
Yeah then maybe you gon' sweat off your Maybelline
One time, two time, three time
Nigga four times, five times, me time
Here I go now, Beast Mode, Oak Town
Then I let her tell her friends, you know how these hoes talk
Might c-walk to the Ghost, see me ghost ride
T-Raww get it poppin', I can never go pop
Dope boy smile, all you see is coke white
And I need more mold till a nigga multi
She can get fat like Oprah
As long as she always give back like Oprah

[Hook]
You know what? Shit has gone too far, shit's gone too far
And whatever drugs you on, y'all been on too long
Shit's gone too far
And my bitch say she miss me, I've been gone too long
Like bitch I'm only goin' to the store, I'll be back in a minute
Rappers ain't rapped in a minute
Sayin' broke is a joke, I ain't laughed in a minute

[Verse 2]
And my new shit fuego
And the money silly putty, that's my play dough
No Seiko, it's an Audemar
Always workin', how you find time to drive all them cars?
She wanna tell me how she feel, have a heart to heart
Shorty won't you swing my way, I ain't talkin' golf
New Maybach, I'm talkin' boss
Say your ex-nigga hurt, tell him walk it off
One time, two time, three time
Nigga four times, five times, me time
Here I go now, freak show, Popeye
Nigga I've been on the spinach and I'm gettin' rock hard
T-Raww authentic, most them niggas knock-offs
Front like the front door, why you knock offs?
I don't front, get your dough, I don't knock ya'll
You got your surfboard but the wave ain't yours

[Hook]
Dawg, shit has gone too far, shit's gone too far
And whatever drugs you on, y'all been on too long
Shit's gone too far
And my bitch say she miss me, I've been gone too long
Like bitch I'm only goin' to the store, I'll be back in a minute
Rappers ain't rapped in a minute
Sayin' broke is a joke, I ain't laughed in a minute
