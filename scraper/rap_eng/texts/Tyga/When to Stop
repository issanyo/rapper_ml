[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, what’s the opposite of satisfaction? You never had it
A sex addict there when you needed it
Now you’re too distracted by the little things, cars, rings, none of it matters
Presidential suites in Nevada, you was too ecstatic
Time tickin', you was 24 karat
Mrs. Hard Headed, don’t listen but the head was terrific, ah
Had a vision, you bought it, couldn't wait 'til you saw it
Swear you had it all, Jordy lost it all and you know it
Know I did it, I'm ridin' round with my new bitch
I'm poppin' bottles and shoppin' and flyin' private to Maui
Livin' life, no excuses, don’t give two fucks about you
You seen my girl ass lately? Now watch me fuck her crazy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me when to stop, you know I ain't gon' hurt you, babe
Tell me when to stop, but if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop, I'ma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby, you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She said I could take control of her body, but it’s only for the weekend
Said I'ma let you do you, oh yeah, I'ma do you, take you to the room, boom, boom
I make her feel it in her rib cage, roll my weed on it
Just like it’s her birthday, I'm tippin', you sippin', sparklers come with that Ace of Spades
I'm faded, sipping and leaning, I'm faded, sipping and leaning
Sparklers come with that Ace of Spades
I'm faded, sipping and leaning
I'ma fuck you like I'm in a bad mood

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me when to stop, you know I ain't gon' hurt you, babe
Tell me when to stop, but if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop, I'ma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby, you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Uh, long hair, red lipstick, lips burned from that cigarette
Versace heels and them latex, neck collar, that that’s a fact
I fuck with you 'cause it makes sense, we don’t fight but this make up sex
Less is more but you more or less, got the top down in my Corvette, yeah
Red from the summer, must've made a wrong turn, checked in a motel just to have sex
Like strangers fuckin' out of anger, puttin' on handcuffs, now a nigga chained up
'Til the maid come clean up, broken mirrors so you know that’s bad luck
Lost my wallet, told you hurry up, pack up, flee the scene, seen a chef just pull up
Shots of tequila, let’s get freaky, lookin' for a reason
By the look in yo' eyes you don’t gotta say much, I can tell that you need it
And you need it just as much as I needed you
Word on streets, I pull work for two, yo' home girl wanna see if it’s true, so just

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Tyga)]
Tell me when to stop, you know I ain't gon' hurt you, babe (yeah)
Tell me when to stop, but if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop, I'ma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby, you can get it
Tell me when to stop, you know I ain't gon' hurt you, babe
Tell me when to stop, but if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop, I'ma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby, you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
