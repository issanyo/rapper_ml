[Refrain: Jess Jackson & Tyga]
The ceiling's falling in
Every time I don't know where you've been
Out on love
At this point, I realize love is not an emotion I can neglect
Seventeen to lifetime, I thought, I knew
My queen thought I wasn't ready for love, she was right
The seasons change when we all stay the same
What did love mean to me? It didn't mean anything
The pain (compassion, affection)
I felt back then won't ever go away
I just knew I wanted her back
Echoes call me back to the feeling again
Can't be a king without love
Echoes call me back to the feeling again (love)
Echoes call me back to the feeling again
