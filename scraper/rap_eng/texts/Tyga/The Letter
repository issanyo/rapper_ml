[Intro: Esty]
Tell me when to stop…
Tell me when to stop…

[Bridge: Esty]
In the haze we lose
Can’t just have it all
In the haze we fall
Coulda had it all
In the haze we lose
Can’t just have it all
In the haze we lose
We coulda had it all

[Verse 1: Esty]
Be honest, I know you now
You look to see
Stop and wait
And really it don’t matter
I know you do (I know you do)
You don’t understand, there’s a time and place
I’m gon let you know, now listen
I don’t you to, you don’t want to say it
Tell me what it is you feel
Don’t be shy
(Don’t be shy)

[Hook: Esty]
Testin' you like you testin' me
Testin' you while you testin' me
Testin' you like you testin' me
Testin' you like you testin' me
And I know

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, watching the stars
On a yellow brick road like the Wizard of Oz
Ain’t no workin titles for this little thing of ours
I tell you the game like I'm Ahmad rashad
I put roses on my neck, rose petal and stars
I kiss you down low but I let you decide
I get behind you like you’re making dirty wind
Get you a glass of muscato, that’s yo favorite wine
And I… know
Can’t hold yo prop cuz it’s yours
Like Versace models you be giftin leather
You my bread and butter, let’s toast
And I… hope
Like Shepard's Fairey we can fly canaries
Obey my presence, you are a blessing
I am a reverend so start confessing

[Bridge:Esty]
In the haze we lose
Can’t just have it all
In the haze we fall
Coulda had it all
In the haze we lose
Can’t just have it all
In the haze we lose
We coulda had it all
[Hook: Esty]
Testin' you like you testin' me
Testin' you while you testin' me
Testin' you like you testin' me
Testin' you like you testin' me
And I know
