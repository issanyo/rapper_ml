[Intro]
God give me some shit off, fuzzy me
Yo, see what is going on? (in the creep?)

[Verse 1]
It's time for some clarity, lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity
Say what you want, your lies can't embarrass me
Your lies don't embarrass me, fly to an island
Then fly back in parakeet
I'm in that new Bentley truck
What the fuck nigga you still in that Cherokee
Theres no compared to me I'm in my mansion and you're in that Air BnB
Ion see you niggas see you niggas see threw you heard of me
When I see you niggas and you there man you just there to me
All in the way, bruh, I don't got a jersey on, I ain't come to play, bruh
Oh you throwin' shade, huh? Take off your shades, bruh
Recognize a don when you see one, can't see straight, huh

[Refrain]
It's time for some clarity, lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

[Hook]
She drinkin' that drink, she gone off that clear with me
We sippin' that brown, we mixin' it up, we'll be sick in the mornin'
Our flow be sick for so long, dog I just ignore it
From the rip man I came up so poor, I just keep pourin'
And we don't do shit if it's norm, nah, we do shit enormous
And let's get this shit clear, my Christmas list is the Forbes list
It's time for some clarity, lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

[Verse 2]
Say what you want, your comments don't embarrass me
No your comments don't embarrass me
We just laugh at them shits, they hilarious
In and out the country so much motherfuckers try to swear I'm a terrorist
Flexin with your shooters but your nigga don't terror me
Your niggas ain't terror squad, here go some clarity
You know I'm the best, you scared of success, you should be scared of me
Just blew a bag at the mall, that's therapy
Just gave some swag to you dog, that's charity

[Refrain]
It's time for some clarity, lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

[Hook]
She drinkin' that drink, she gone off that clear with me
We sippin' that brown, we mixin' it up, we'll be sick in the mornin'
Our flow be sick for so long, dog I just ignore it
From the rip man I came up so poor, I just keep pourin'
And we don't do shit if it's norm, nah, we do shit enormous
And let's get this shit clear, my Christmas list is the Forbes list
It's time for some clarity, lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

[Inaudible]

It's time for some clarity, lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity
It's time for some clarity, lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity
