[Hook:Tyga]
Oh, niggas wanna bang, all my niggas getting dollars
Bitches wanna fuck just to be my baby mama
Put a 100 on it, put a 100 on it
I put a 100 on it, real niggas fallin’
All I know is young money, money and the power
Bitches wanna fuck just to be my baby mama
Put a 100 on it, put a 100 on it
I put a 100 on it, real niggas balling

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Money falling out of my jeans
Double white cup filled up with the lean
Niggas keep talking get heat with the bean
That’s a permanent lean
And I ain’t talking promet the zine
I’m talking my..in magazines
And hitting up niggas and looking up sleans
That’s what I mean, I put on for my team
Y to M to the CMB, walk in the club and bet my money
I bet your bitch come see bout me
Came in this bitch by one AM
And me and your girl and my whip by three
I’ma do me, you do you, your girl do the same thing that I do
I’m fly from here to talk what’s head back all the way down to my shoes
We’ve been getting money while you boys is getting by
Running my paper do money machines
They cutting my green while I’m getting high

[Hook Tyga]
Oh, niggas wanna bang, all my niggas getting dollars
Bitches wanna fuck just to be my baby mama
Put a 100 on it, put a 100 on it
I put a 100 on it, real niggas fallin’
All I know is young money, money and the power
Bitches wanna fuck just to be my baby mama
Put a 100 on it, put a 100 on it
I put a 100 on it, real niggas balling

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
I’m getting raise for the money
I’m gone too hard to fall off
Treating my haters like bitches
I’m itchin the middle finger fuck all yall
Put a 100 on it, I put a 100 on it
My left pinky got a diamond plus it’s nug it on it
I serve you if you want it, murder that upon this
Look me in my eyes and look like murder done it
Large pistol turn allowed more quiet in the shit
That I’m rap it start the down south ride in the shit
That you’re copin real niggas don’t boy I’m getting to the money
I’m eating no diet I walk up in the club and my niggas throwin up games side
One of the few that keep it real and rap it the same time
