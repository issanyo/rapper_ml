How you say you innocent? Illegitimate children
Ain't gon hurt, who feels it? Artists with ?
Fuck em, middle finger never bent
Only at the Lord's gates, judging me to let me in
It's funny, but it's federal bills
Spend it from siblings
Since they figured it in, back turns, no friends
I'm only human, fly as Donatella Versace
We all die soon, like ? on the autopsy
Hard-bodied
Body eroded, gets you buried with black roses
Time
