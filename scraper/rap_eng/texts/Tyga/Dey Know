[Verse 1: Tyga]
Tygaman, more unaverage than white africans
So she send me emails, only with attachments
So I attach that that, to the Mac Mac Macbook Apple man
How you balling trying to duffle up off of a fucking grand?
I got that ice shine, light blue, like a taser
So damn bright gotta patch your eye, like a raider
White and black diamonds like pepper she salt shaking
Dough I got so she give me that cookie, but I'm no baker
I like the way I rap it, little healthiest rapper
Collect salad, spend it on carrots, and well...,
Tyga? He know that he holding the flow with a bounce like a rabbit
One hundredth his clothes, I'm getting so low looks like a funeral casket
Like Toni Braxton, Let me breath ducking
Or stay within a hundred feet if you've got beef with him
Cause around be G.E.D., Young Money, and security
With shit that'll make you forever peace
Scary ass nigga, I heard your jewelry rented
Like enterprise, but we different we'll put your life on tinted
Get kicked out the game, but I rap timid, fatality you're finished
I'm just beginning, you ol' head like Emmit

[Verse 2: Benny Boy]
It's Tyga and Benevolent, and he is my boy
Yup I'm from Las Vegas, and he's a tiger but we ain't Siegfried and Roy
Cause haters making some noise, and oh yes we gets annoyed
When they run their yap, the results from that, is that the beat gets destroyed
Did my own haircut like Britney's doing
But I lined it up, what you think he's stupid
If you steal my style, you going to get me suing
So dope I look sick call me Whitney Houston
Or even Bobby Brown, man I need a therapist
Please somebody find my mind, cause I don't know where it is
You could say I'm cocky, conceited, or even arrogant
I'm like that cause I'm finna blow up like a terrorist
One of my bad habits is my hobby shopping
Name any pairs of ice creams, I probably got them
I'm coming up fast, like I'm watching Buff the body jogging
Y'all ain't even coming up like Irv Gotti's problem
Everybody think I'm dumb like I come from the bay
I'm just having fun, there's a smile curling up on my face
Now my time's up, so I ain't got nothing to say
And I always leave the room like this, Up up and away
Cause I'm fly
