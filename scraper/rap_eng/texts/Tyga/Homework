[Verse: Tyga]
Stay in school, do your homework
I was on first, yeah, yeah, yeah, what
I supply my own work
Stay in school, do your homework
Nigga, im a teacher, how to get the media
School, they tried to beat me up
Now you see that my feet is up, ooh
Got that true shit, thats too true
Yeah I got that new, new
So new, that its too new, ooh
Get your booth, 'fore your boohoo
What she make a move
With my new gold swisher, chauffeur
Uh, go with the fur
You ain't heard I'm paid?
Stay in school, do your homework
