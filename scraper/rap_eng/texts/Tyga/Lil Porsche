I done fell in love with the Porsche aye
Talking all white when I kiss the Porsche aye
Talking back to murder trials like OJ
That's when I first fell in love with the Porsche aye
I used to see her when I tried to meet with Jose
She used to post outside of my workplace
I had so many pics of Lil Porsche
When my cell ring pictures of Lil Porsche
My homie tried to tell me she was no good, yea
Looked at the nigga I'm like no way
She said she only fuck with rich niggas only
Okay wait til I get my money popping bitch

Oh lil Porsche, I'm in love with you

Kiss you on the cheek it's a double date
Do it right before my court date

She drive all the ghetto boys crazy
I couldn't make my mind, it didn't phase me
Cause when I met you, you my fantasy
Oh lil Porsche, I got a thing for you
Every single night I'm having dreams 'bout you
