Chours...

1st Verse

Uh am in a rollz that don't roll right
Got money so its gotta be a fun night
Got girls all in ma' phone list
Im tryna find a new chick that i can hang with
But if your girls right here you in bad luck
Cause i be hawking for your girl for some free touch(f***)

Give me sumn' throw goose in the air
Be spending 9 stacks homie cause i don't care
I don't need you, your nor need you
Unless you wearing no bra and a see through
But tomorrow i would be you
Cause ill be all up in your and then i leave you
Give me sumn throw sumn bottled up
All ma real girls here nothing padded up
Paper paper somebody call the waiter
Ill be so high but am so so fly

Chours... (Chris Brown)

Gold chains made in ma' name
You'll be hating on me
Well HO!! what a shame
Great big Dane drive your girl insane
Say she wanna (break{F****}) by the sound a ma' name
The name, the money im getting kinda famous
Drowning in the wealth life guard come and save us
The name YL (Young Luiy) made for a reason
She the type a chick that i see every season
Club, money, pro's (Ho**), love me
The club be going up even when its sunny
She told in ma ear ain't nobody be above me
I can make a million on a track with a dummy
Authentic i treat like a picnic you treat her like a pond
Cause all i do is make her wet
UH!!!
I treat her like a pond cause all i do is make her wet

Chours (Chris Brown)

Give me money i only where designers
These girls (Ho**) ain't loyal they touch (Fu**) for designers
I did it

I know i did it
You can buy the bar homie i can buy the building
You be throwing shots

Drizzy after i was born nothing was the same
Homie out here homie tryna make a name
While his girls at ma house homie screaming out ma name
She could be Spanish i love your language
She can call me pa-pi while am doing her damage
I got carrots sumn' like a rabbit
Am a young king but am in a small package
