[Chrous]
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I could feel the temperature, temperature

[Verse 1]
I pick you up in a Bentley truck, come outside
Hit me up when you need some downtime
Damn girl, it's about time
Off at 4, I want to see you around 5
Now I'm 4:45, I'll be on my way
Ya I'm on my way come outside
Baby girl, you're never that mine
I lost my watch and I still found time
Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm
Let your ex-man stay in the storm
When you don't have to force it, it's a force
All I ever want is more

[Chorus]
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
And what's left in the love if I gave you all of me, be patient
And when you need space, I give you a spaceship
Take all the space you need yeah
Face your freedom with the face
You still be mine
Before we lay we lie
I get you so wet, would you come clean, oh I

[Chorus]
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall, yeah

[Verse 3]
Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm
Let your ex-man stay in the storm
When you don't have to force it, it's a force
All I ever want is more
And I cannot protect you when you flex so far away
I remember when I met you, the thought of sex was so far away
All I wanted is to talk to you
Thought it would be cool to tell me what I thought of you
You're radiant, you're vibrate
Intelligent, you know I'm the lightning
I'm more like lightning, your like fire is frightening

[Chorus]
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise
The temperature, temperature
Yeah I, I say I could get you so high
You might die if you fall
