[Hook: Tyga]
She ain't playing, not a bit
She don't fuck around, she with the shit
She bounce that ass, till' a nigga get dizzy
My, my, my bitch get busy, busy, busy
My, my, my bitch get busy, busy, busy
(Look at her go)

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
All eyes on her
In that ? skirt
Matchin with the ? purse
Gotta coordinate, dropped a quarter on her hair
Drop it in my lap, let a nigga know it's real
See all stacked up, lil' momma know the deal
Baby beat it up, ivander holyfield
Get hoes in these churches just for actin' like a ho
Only rap nigga out in traffic in the fo' like it's 1994
When i parolled outta ?
? young glasses don't ?
'fuck you mean?
And ever since I got the gs, that bitch like fuck recess

[Hook: Tyga]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Drop, drop it on the floo'
You know I'm high as fuck bitch, keep it on the low
She give me good head, call that shit sloppy joe
I'm the shit, smell chanel cologne send it all to go
Westside, fat ass I get behind her
I'm in the pussy all night like a fucking dina
Nosey ass pinocchio, rappers be quiet
Say you getting more money than me, you a liar
Killing shit, gangster attire, bitches admire
You sweet as papaya, bandana and the ties
Life in the game don't jeopardize it
I'm the truth, put that on Zion
T-Rah, shit!
