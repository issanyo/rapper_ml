Uh, haha

Haah, gettin that money I been waiting' for
Ray Allen number nutting less than 20K a show
Used to wanna be a B-Baller now I ball without a coach
Heard she ain't fuckin', she ain't fuckin?

Haah, Gettin that money I been waitin' for
Ray Allen number nuttin less than 20K a show
Used to wanna be a B-Baller now I ball without a coach
Heard she ain't fuckin', she ain't fuckin?, then she gotta go!

I turn beast, Billy badass Geronimo
Call me young heart attack, you just give her minor strokes
Patty cake dick her down then she row, row her boat
Penetrated in her throat
Now she in a comatose
Been waitin' ages my nigga kicked in the fuckin' door
Had me on some Bullshit
Manifestin' evidence
Ever since turn into a bull Carlos Boozer shit
Send a killer, kill the stage on some thriller shit
Said she don't swallow on her knees
She goin' spit it out like a policy
I'm so nasty fuck her in the back seat
Doggystyle Lassie Mr. boombastic, Shaggy!
Motherfuck the law, I Pac all y'all
I pop all ya'll
For my family, my dawgs to my mother, bless her heart
I am her only son, and her son ain't far
Shinnin' I'm a star, nigga
Luminous charm
Just blew up but I been a bomb
Boys tryna show up, gettin' shitted on
I'm at the game courtside with my camo's on
Herringbone, snap back
Gettin' lap dance while you gettin' laughed at
I swear this that nigga dig a whole
Get you buried track
And you've awaken the dead the anti-christ is back

I know you don't give a fuck about me
I swear I don't give a fuck about you
So I'm a get this money
And count it all day while you muthafuckas say who dat!
