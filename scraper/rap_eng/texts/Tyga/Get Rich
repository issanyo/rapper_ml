[Verse 1]
Auggh, I ain’t fucking with no plain Janes
Getting head on the plane, call it head space
Need legs space, make her knees shake
She been twerkin it all night, she gon need a break!
Auhg, god damn Dupri, the beat bang
Trade hoes like players need a coach name
T-Raww gang, nigga last king
Nigga hating cause I'm ballin, telling more shame
Rack city triple x 10 mil, baby
Used to be balling, now I’m Bill Gating
Hate a shy bitch cause I’m inpatient
Live your life like a king and it’s so amazing!

[Verse 2]
Uh, 9th grade used to play hookey
Told your bitch I'll pass on the dry pussy
I don’t need your pussy, I get too much pussies
Fucked her in the kitchen, kept the food cooking
Augh, 22 young millionaire
Crib in Bel Air, all the bitches stare
T T-rawws on - you should cop a pair!
No house phone (cause I’m never there!)
I fucked her best friend and it's all love
Cause I get her best friends all in the club
Niggas po’d up, bitches off drugs
And now she wanna do it is fuck with a thug

[Hook]
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars at the crib, gotta have it
Uh, and this your song if you a bad bitch
One time I’ma show you how to get rich!
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars at the crib, gotta have it
Uh, and this your song if you a bad bitch
One time I’ma show you how to get rich!
Show you how to get rich, show you how to get rich
Uh, getting money is a habit
Nice cars ant the crib, gotta have it!

[Outro]
So amazing! Live your life like a king and it’s so amazing!
