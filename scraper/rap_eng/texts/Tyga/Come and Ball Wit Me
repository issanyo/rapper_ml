[Intro]
You should be calling me
Now you should be
Know it turns you on when I'm on the B
Put this jersey on, baby, ball

[Chorus]
Now you should be callin' me
Now you should be callin' me, yeah
I know it turns you on when I'm on the B
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah
You should be callin' me
Now you should be callin' me, yeah
Make a nigga honk his horn then that skrrt, beat, beat
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say you trippin', how you fall for me though?
My wrist drippin', I just spent a kilo
That Bugatti take off like my migo
I shoot my shot, then I reload
Ever seen two mil ride down Pico?
Ever spent 20 bands on an E coupe?
I'm with my Blood niggas, gettin' what they bleed for
My Crip niggas gettin' cribs on the seashore
Give it all to me though
I have your wrist drippin', baby, muy frío
She’ll have a rap nigga on this R&B flow
Like come and talk to me 'cause we know

[Chorus]
Now you should be callin' me
Now you should be callin' me, yeah
I know it turns you on when I'm on the B
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah
You should be callin' me
Now you should be callin' me, yeah
Make a nigga honk his horn then that skrrt, beat, beat
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
What number do you wanna be?
I make you number one, yeah, one is all I need, yeah, yeah
They say you trippin', how you fall for me though?
Askin' bitches why they always be alone
Tell the freaks to find a man of they own
We in MIA, in M-I-Yayo
Fast nights, I like to start my day slow
Take my time, count 100K up, oh, yeah
Now all this ice, how can I not keep my cool?
And with all this ice, I freeze time for you
And with all this ice, we skate straight to the top
Your body-ody's tellin' you

[Chorus]
Now you should be callin' me
Now you should be callin' me, yeah
I know it turns you on when I'm on the B
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah
You should be callin' me
You should be callin' me, yeah
Make a nigga honk his horn then that skrrt, beat, beat
Put this jersey on, baby, ball with me, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Come and ball with me
I wanna show you, girl
I really wanna show you things
I really wanna
Come and ball with me
I wanna show you, girl
I really wanna show you things
I really wanna
