[Pre-Chorus]
Put on your sundress, girl, I'm 'bout to make it hot, yeah
Come park it on my lap and twist up another one
See God spent more time on you than he did on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
For seven days straight, I been weak

[Chorus]
She gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, she gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, she gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, like hot noodle soup
Ooh, that made me feel better, yeah, yeah, baby, hop in this coupe

[Verse 1]
We can go wherever, no pressure, it's no pressure
This ain't no interview, no questions
If it feels right, it's right, I got you in the mood, woo
This woman make the headline, yeah, the head's right every time
Yeah, it gets me hot every time
I put that on my life, that's a deadline, oh woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on your sundress, girl, I'm 'bout to make it hot, yeah
Come park it on my lap and twist up another one
See God spent more time on you than he did on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
For seven days straight, I been weak

[Chorus]
She gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, she gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, she gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, like hot noodle soup
Ooh, that made me feel better, yeah, yeah, baby, hop in this coupe

[Verse 2]
I'm droppin' the roof, don't argue with you
Keep it solid with me, yeah, I keep it solid with you
You know what's poppin' with me, boo, what's poppin' with you?
I got a watch that pop up, you know I'm popular too
I might watch you pop more and I might pop me one too
They wanna get between the sheets when the iceys come through, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on your sundress, girl, I'm 'bout to make it hot, yeah
Come park it on my lap and twist up another one
See God spent more time on you than he did on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
For seven days straight, I been weak

[Chorus]
She gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, she gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, she gon' make me feel better, yeah, yeah, like hot noodle soup
Ooh, that made me feel better, yeah, yeah, baby, hop in this coupe
