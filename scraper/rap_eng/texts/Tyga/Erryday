[Intro:]
T-Raww
Do this shit erryday

[Hook: x2]
I’m making money nigga erryday, erryday, erryday
She making promises erryday, erryday, erryday
I’m sipping somethin’ smoking mary jane, mary jane, erryday
Kilos of gold on erryday, erryday, it’s pay day

[Verse 1:]
Mozart with the Mulsanne
Most hated with the most chains
I'm polar bear on my ice game
You pointing fingers, someone to blame
I’m sick of shit, nigga, tired of liars
So high feel like dying
No reparations, no check for slavery
My current location somewhere in Vegas
Man I hope I make it, hope I make it
God's plan, not even you can save me
King Musa baby, I’m a Musa baby
I need baby like a more baby
Need décor baby, my house amazin'
Went so low like a temptation
Shit gettin' rough, gotta be abrasive
Signs of things, gotta keep a banger
Fuck that, when you ends low can't trust nobody
My back against the wall and I don't fuck with nobody
Know somebody caught a body and he haunted, I don't want that
Count your blessings, stop complainin'
Be precision with your aimin'
Cause I'm

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2:]
(Wish you knew somebody, wish you knew that keep it quiet
Ain't new to this island, if you knew me you be silent
Everyday that's a new bitch in my face, what you say
Pop that Rollie in my case and my space like NASA sponsor)
Pussy monster, chop that nonsense, it get violent round my way
(?) better make your mind up, start that engine, need you start us
I'm typically not normal, I ain't atheist so believe in me
All about my currency, dollar signs and kingery
(T-Raww)
The new Messiah, follow me into your freedom
I can lead you, swear of allegiance
No more pain and grievin'
Suffer long from dreamin'
When I know what's up with me and Wiz Khalifa
But me and Wiz Khalifa smokin' reefer
Then I'm flyin' private to a feature cause

[Hook: x3]
