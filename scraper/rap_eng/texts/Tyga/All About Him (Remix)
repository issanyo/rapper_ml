Its Auburn and J.R

[Tyga]

(Uh Tyga)

Uh, romeo & juliet - real love real things, kiss and neck
You about to get something you won't regret
And this is gon' be the bound, this is what I bet
(Yep, uh) Girl stop playing with me
Ive been waiting all day like the tank empty (yeah)
I need love - she said give it to me
Never triple hating, buisness is all about

[Aburn]

Cause Im all about him him him him him
And he's all about me me me me me
And we dont give a dang dang dang dang dang
About nobody-e-e-e
Cause Im all about him him him him him
And he's all about me me me me me
And we dont give a dang dang dang dang dang
About nobody-e-e-e

Well, had him shooting for me like a ball team
Every guy was a knock out, Don king
But none of em had smarts thats my thing
Its not enough to have balls, Spalding, ha
One day by starbucks
I bumped into a guy rocking black chucks
He said "Excuse me, beautiful" I said " Aww Shucks"
And then he asked
"Well ay, wanna grab lunch?" (ay you wanna grab lunch)

Never ever met a guy so fly
Got me hooked like apple pie, I
Think Im falling and I dont know why
But I won't fight these butterflies

Cause Im all about him him him him him
And hes all about me me me me me
And we dont give a dang dang dang dang dang
About nobody-e-e-e
Cause Im all about him him him him him
And hes all about me me me me me
And we dont give a dang dang dang dang dang
About nobody-e-e-e

And I sware what we have is just super cool
The way he always in my head like a blue tooth
I got a text from him, he said come through (come through)
Told me taht he wants to kick it, Kung fu
Dont do nothing much at all
Just we and his boys watching football
He asked for a kiss (Muah) So I gave him two
He said "Well, thank you baby" I said "You're Welcome Boo"

Never ever met a guy so fly
Got me hooked like apple pie, I
Think Im falling and I dont know why
But I won't fight these butterflies

Cause Im all about him him him him him
And hes all about me me me me me
And we dont give a dang dang dang dang dang
About Nobody-e-e-e
Cause Im all about him him him him him
And hes all about me me me me me
And we dont give a dang dang dang dang dang
About nobody-e-e-e

No I dont need no fancy cars
And I dont need no diamond rings
My baby is all I need and more
Cause I dont want those extra things
Its not about you (Oh-oh-oh-oh) (Its not about you)
Its not about them (oh-oh-oh-oh) (Its not about them)
Its all about me (Oh-oh-oh-oh) (Its all about me)
And its all about him (Oh-oh-oh-oh) (Its all about him)

[Tyga]

Never make a jump with ya eyes closed (yeah)
Face first - until your undersoul
Feeling like im racin on a bumpy road
I see them stop signs but we just rushin thru em (em)
Seein that I drivin you crazy
But I dont drive a flu - like Aladian baby
Magic carpet you can be my Jaszmine Lady
Take a sip its a genie in a bottle waiting
Wait Wait, no worry what the haters sayin
Rumors gon come we just barricade em
Forget em all
Erase em all day all she say is...

Cause im all about him him him him him
And hes all about me me me me me
And we dont give a dang dang dang dang dang
About nobody-e-e-e
Cause im all about him him him him him
And hes all about me me me me me
And we dont give a dang dang dang dang dang
About nobody-e-e-e

(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Cause im all about him
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Cause im all about him
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Im all about him
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) And we dont give a dang dang dang
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Its all about you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Its all about you, boy

(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
