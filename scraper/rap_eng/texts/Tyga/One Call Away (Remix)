[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take a chance

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You and me can make it anywhere
For now, we can stay here for a while
Cause you know, I just wanna see you smile

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Bling my hotline, I'm only one call away
You wanna ball, we only one mall away
Aye, dare, I see you again like Charlie say
Again and again, that's always bae
Back when I was poor, I only had a heart to break
We was splittin' meals, two straws and a chocolate shake
You had my back and that's true to facts
When you need your boy, pick up the phone and do the math

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Tyga]
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Pick up the line, I got you
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one, I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away
