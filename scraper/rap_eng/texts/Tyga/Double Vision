[Verse 1: Prince Royce]
Girl 1
I swear I told myself that she's the one
Girl 2
I hate myself because I love her, too
Girl 1
She don't give me drama
Type that you bring home to mama
Girl 2
I try breaking up, but I can't get enough

[Pre-Chorus: Prince Royce]
Got both of 'em on my mind
I don't know where to draw the line
Never been in this place before
But I gotta let one of them go

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision

[Post-Chorus: Prince Royce]
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Why you teasin' with your pants on?
Go on ahead, take 'em off, this a dance song
Play the ringtone, pour some alcohol
I don't wanna judge you, babe, but I can see your thong
On, off, kissing all your tickle spots
Faded, having double vision, standing under mistletoe
King, gold chains and watch your cameltoe
She gon' say "You can't touch" just like Hammer, though
I'm on to the crack of dawn
Lifting up your skirt, I'm a flirt, getting mega dome
Call a friend through, use my iPhone
Tell her come over right now, she never got home

[Pre-Chorus: Prince Royce]
Got both of 'em on my mind
I don't know where to draw the line
Never been in this place before
But I gotta let one of them go

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision

[Post-Chorus: Prince Royce]
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got (I've got) double vision
I've got (I've got) (I've got) double vision
I've got

[Bridge: Prince Royce]
Somebody help me out
I'm in love with these women
Somebody help me out
I'm in love with these women
Somebody help me out
I can't make a decision
Somebody help me out
I've got double vision
I've got double vision

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause I'm in love with these two women
And my heart ain't tryna listen
Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
'Cause I just can't keep up with 'em
But I gotta make a decision

[Post-Chorus: Prince Royce]
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
I've got double vision
