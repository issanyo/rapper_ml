[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Cool as a breeze, hot as the summer
Ridin' in a Hummer, soundin' like thunder
Lookin' for a missus, wrap her up in kisses
Keep her hella happy by fulfillin' all her wishes
Look inside my heart and you can see that I have tried
Look into my eyes and you can see that I have lied
Don't act surprised, try to compromise
I just wanted some of the pleasure between your thighs
High and I'm blazin', life's so amazin'
Hoes like I'm lacin', broads I'm replacin'
Murder competition, I'm talkin' all editions
I'm just doin' mixtapes to keep my repetition
It's Q, Quincy Hanley to be exact
It's not another rapper that's better and this is fact
The main attraction, action
These rappers say they not actin', I beg to differ
I smoked a piffer, I drink the liquor
Mixed with the Henney, mixed with the Remy
Mixed with the vodka, body intoxi-cated
Faded, niggas they hate it
Because I'm shittin' on 'em, these rappers constipated
So don't betray it, I keep it doin' how I'm doin'
Still pursuin' every dream for my team
I just seen him servin' fiends with this hip-hop crack rock
Studio's the crack spot
Jumpin' out the track pot, lyrics make the water get hot
I keep it movin', I keep it groovin'
I keep 'em open, they body soakin', my body pokin'
I stay emotion, but not the picture
Very soon they'll bring hip-hop back up-to-date and can't wait

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I optimize out of ten
Your past tense shit, I was already in
Now our shit's tense, no need for a rim
Fence, air out, airhead, bitch, get in and out
Four blocks past Rosecrans the gas station
Cruisin', I ain't doin', I'm just makin' routes
Rowdy, bumpin' like South States
Southern in your blouse, ow
As I pull that out, got a loft with a red couch
Come see what it's about, I announce I am President 25
No age, December days, up and away I go
Take more money, overdose
If you don't, then you they will take plenty from
Dumb to niggas and debate off a drum
'Yum' to bitches that be givin' up the puss to me
Tyga, man, flyer than the next
Hey, I bring figures out, you ain't got to guess
S on my chest, don't relate Superman
YSL, price high as hell, God damn, damn
Just lampin', future fashion, on a hammock
Don't mean to sound famous, did I offend you?
I can't stand it, appear like magician
Televise and then I vanish, vanish
I might change to a different channel
I'm everywhere like pics on the mantle
Pissed cause I ain't gon' stop if it's cancelled
Call me Thailand, poom, flow so national, nigga

[Verse 3: Mistah F.A.B.]
I am in the zone, yes
Two-three, box one, any others on can't defend me
I'm, uh, on the end
Slowin', goin', hit from the corner like Bowen
Bruce, ooh, plus I'm off juice, yes, mess, no
Get loose, yes, contest, West what I do
Where I am, how, how 'bout you?
I'm a schoolboy just like Q
Who? Q, no, not Quincy from Juice
But it's me, back to this thing, man, I gots Bruce
Yes, Springsteen, yes, I always do my thing
Cold like the winter, hot like spring
Well, not hot like mild, mixin' in hot and wild, wow
Style, how I get through when I move to the crowd?
Everyday's a show, so I just take bows
Thank you, hands of applause, wall
When I'm on stage, hands on my balls
Holdin' them, my scrot' and them
Huh, I'm scoldin' them
Showin' them how I continue to rollin' them
Flowin' them, you don't understand
You're not knowin' him, don't try to point out me
Cause there will be no point
Out please when you point
That's three comin' back at you
Or should I say me cause I'm the one pointin'
