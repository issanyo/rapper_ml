Ugh, all the other boys served that sour
They call me T-Raww served that raw
All I do is make crack
I serve that hard
I keep 'em comin' back
I'm the Rawwest Nigga Alive

[Verse 1]
For the bitches stickin' hunnids in their bra
For my niggas buyin' you at the mall
What you wanna do?
Wanna be ballers, wanna be the rawwest nigga that they ever saw
Bitch come click my cigar
My son was rich 'fore he knew how to crawl
What you wanna do?
Wanna be ballers
Yeah I'm the rawwest nigga that you ever saw
I served your mama that raw
I served your daddy that raw
I served your cousin, I served your uncle
Shit I served my family that raw
I'm the one you should call
I got the Billie Jean keep 'em jumpin off the wall
Dawg, take it off
Ice, let it thaw
Imma make you move
Like it is in the U-Haul

Ugh, all the other boys served that sour

[Verse 2]
Got a white old school thats Madonna
Watch them boys try to bite like Piranha
Partyin' you ain't got to pack no pajamas
And the pinky ring cost 'bout a hundred
All in my bussiness when you know I fly private
Ask the propeller, who the flyest?
I can sell water to an island
Young jiggy nigga like Will Smith
Camera said that off, I need a trill bitch
They ask for car man cause I will switch
Blew a few mill but I'm still rich, real famous
But I'm still humble
Told her supersize me Imma need the combo
Combination to my safe Nino Ablo
In my safe thats comma comma
I got the detonator (?)

[Hook]x4
Ugh, all the other boys served that sour
They call me T-Raww served that raw
All I do is make crack
I served that hard
I keep 'em comin' back
I'm the Rawwest Nigga Alive
