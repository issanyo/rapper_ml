[Verse: Tyga]
Fuck it, straight up

Versace chain hunna thousand, make Channel chains look lousy
I just bought a Ferrari, and you just bought some Air Jordan's
That's for all you bloggers, I'm fuckin' the bitches that you bloggin'
Went Goyard retarded, and my VVS is flawless
I'mma big nigga like Wallace, truthfully you ain't honest
Talkin bout the numbers you profit, I get college money without college
You still own student loans bitch, how you drive nice cars, no home bitch
Now a days niggas just wanna world star shit, don't start no shit won't be no shit, bitch
Always stay with some molly, shout out to molly mall
50 thou at the crap table, I'm about to bet it all
I like the pussy wet, and I like her weave long
I've been on road so long, niggas think they puttin' on but when I'm back home
Done

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
Yo girl got a cute face
Her friend got a nice body
And they just wanna have fun
This my type of party
20 bitches in the lobby
There's plenty bitches in the lobby
And they all drinkin' they smokin'
This my type of party

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Back in this bitch early, taco Tuesday on Thursday
Do it big like I'm Percy, money talks, ya heard me
I got hoes in new jersey, tastes like strawberry Hershey
We went to the mets game, I wore my strawberry jersey
She said nah baby don't hurt me, ass look like it could murk me
Smokin', drinkin', and rappin', what you doin' I'm workin'
Her pussy wet, I'm surfin', she met a nigga in person
Daiquiris, no virgin, racks on me I'm splurgin'
Labels think I'm urban, fuck you and your suburban
F-G-T-P, (what's that) Fuckin' Girls Thats Persian
Waste money on purpose, chicken wings from Church's
I told her I'mma cheap date, she said nah baby you was worth it

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
Yo girl got a cute face
Her friend got a nice body
For real she got a nice body
I think she's doin' that karate, Aye
20 bitches in the lobby
There's plenty bitches in the lobby
They all drinkin' and smokin'
This my type of party
Party (6x)
This my type of party

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Turn Up
Bad chick gimme some of dat brain, trippy mane smokin' like a runaway train
Maybach coupe and I left it plain jane, bought another Bentley and I did the same thang
Pimped out, topped out, ridin' round town wit a hollywood bitch bout to smoke a whole pound
Gettin' higher than a muthafuckin space shuttle, And I like my sprite dirty like a mud puddle
Bring her to the crib, she can fuck the team
On some adderall, and a cup of lean
All this Louie I got on, dope boy fresh
And my weed so loud I think im goin' deaf
Penthouse suite, on the top floor
Taylor Gang ballin out, got the top score
Party like a rock star rollin up good, and you pussy niggas hatin' cause you wish you could

[Hook]
Yo girl got a cute face

This my type of party
