[Verse One: Gilbere Forte]
Look up in the sky, fuck a plane I am higher than
12 ODs from a fiend, I’m inspiring
No holds barred for your dreams, would you die for them?
Kill for them? Put ‘em all on the line?
Break ‘em down and rebuild with ‘em?
You haters jumped the roof and find destiny with your face down
Me and Tyga burn ‘em up before we burn ‘em up
Grade A fire flame, you can spark a lighter
Watch the world say who I’m hotter than
Now you know who they hate now, I’m awake now
I’m forever dreaming, you dying where you been sleeping
Stuck in them pipe dreams where you was destined to be in
Nightmares on Elm Street where Freddy meets his demons, demons
I’m on a rise and never far from the gods
So when I walk through the pain, reality’s just a stain
The eyes of the truth can see it all if you blinded
And if Pac were still around, I’mma be the one to ride for ‘em

[Hook: Raak]
I stepped into this life where I wanna be, all the fucking things that I dreamed of
I’m here now so what else can you tell me huh? I’m here now motherfucker
Yeah I been sitting on the clouds, trying to make you proud
Tell me why the motherfuckers wanna burn me down
Tell me why the motherfuckers wanna burn me down
Tell me why the motherfuckers wanna uh yeah

[Verse Two: Tyga]
Burn me down, hundred rounds, run you down
Ra-pa-pum, automatic, run through your fucking town
Bound to get out of bounds, boy, don’t you fuck around
Round merry-go-round, rosaries if you should be found
Peace, love, sending flowers to mothers and daughters
Me and money vowed together in holy matrimony
Take it from me, break your leg, now they call you Tony
Scar your face, now you the real Tony, crazy chemist in the lab
Evil laugh, needle cab, push your face into the glass
Chop you fast, body bag, let it drag, Brillo pass
Scrape your ass, put your blood up in the flag
This that type of shit that I’m gonna do, marijuana you
I smoke you fools, I overlap and I overdo, number one
Never number two, motherfuckers can’t get over it
Pow, pow, you sober yet? Pow, pow, it’s over bitch

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Gilbere Forte]
You can bring the flames, I’mma bring the snowstorm
Knock ‘em down one at a time, riot bomb
You quiet, calm, I’m setting off all the alarms
Pussy getting, negative, you somewhere watching quiet porn
Bitch, try to burn me down, well here’s my light, good luck motherfucker
I am gone to another light no money can price
Try to take my bitch, impound your wife, I’mma pound her twice
With four, five dykes, the money ain’t shit till I make it rich
Got a pocket full of dreams that you could never sleep on
You allergic to money motherfucker, get your sneeze on
My life’s a flat chick that I’mma throw some D’s on
Your life’s a dirty whore steady getting peed on
You old news, fucking the past years, I’m in new clothes
You stuck in my last years, if this is now, I’m stuck up in the clouds
You can keep the fucking crown, I’m burning the castle down bitch

[Hook]
