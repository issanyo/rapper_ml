[Verse 1: Lyrica]
I know you probably hate me
For always fucking with your head
I just don't know if you want me
Or if you're really after my bread
I do this to everyone
So, don't feel special, yeah!
Don't get comfortable in my bed
After we done ain't nothin' to be said
Probably the perfect one
But I won't change oh
Never believe you when you say I'm the only one

[Chorus: Lyrica]
That's why I do you wrong
So don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
I do this to everyone
So just don't take it personal (yeah)
Don't take it personal

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh!
Baby, If I told you I loved you
It doesn't mean that I don't care
Oh Yeah!
Even I tell you, I need you
Don't you think that I will never be there too
Uh! Keepin' that blue face Uh!
Twenty more racks for the suitcase, yeah!
Clumsy girl, you've been trippin' on me
Thirsty oddest, water drippin' on me
These hoes ain't loyal, Nah!
That's all my niggas Chris has told me
I try to be different for you
Wasn't different for me

[Chorus: Lyrica & Tyga]
That's why I do you wrong
(You can be my hommie now)
So don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
I do this to everyone
So just don't take it personal
Don't take it personal


[Bridge: Lyrica]
Yeah, I got my guard up
Yeah, I got my guard up
Letting it down is hard though
Letting it down is hard though
Boy you gotta show me, show me, show me
Why I should give you loyalty

[Chorus: Lyrica]
That's why I do you wrong
So don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
I do this to everyone
So just don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
But I don't wanna do you wrong
So don't take it personal, (don't take, don't take)
Don't take it personal (don't take)
I do this to everyone
So just don't take it personal
Don't take it personal

[Outro: Lyrica]
Uoo, Yeah, yeah!
Don't take, don't take
Don't take, don't take
