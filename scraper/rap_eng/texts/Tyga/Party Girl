[Verse 1: Tyga]
Life move fast, everyday flash
We like handbags, girls got to grab
Some say it's bad to love with a laugh
She smiles at me, don't even know who I am
But she with me, tonight to the A.M
Said I got to go, she like wait, when?
Wait, where's your friend?
Wait, I'm feeling him
I meant you (you was easier to get to)
Club lights leave the mind frozen
Never seen ice strike like good bowling
Pinned to the sofa, see it much closer
Big Moses, I slide in like loafers
Haha, shame like T say
She stay where we stay if we stay in every state
It's my nature that makes you naughty girl
I'm feeling you but sorry girl

[Hook]
I don't want no party girl, sleeping over time
Just need me someone who can cool it down
Make me feel like love is easy
If love is all you need, let me hear you say
I need it
I gotta have it
Can't play the game no more so I'm doing something about it
And I want it
Yeah, I'm on it
Searching far and wide to find the girl for me, yeah

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
See, I been so many places
And I can't find the one who's for me
When I fall in love I wonder (when I fall in love I wonder)
Experienced so many relations
But still I haven't found what I need
Feels like I'm going under
It's so hard to breathe
Lord I'm tired of losing
I pray you send an angel down
To come and change my life around
Love is so confusing
Can't seem to find a solid ground
Will somebody please show me how

[Hook]
I don't want no party girl, sneaking over town
Just need me someone who can cool it down
Make me feel like love is easy
If love is all you need, then let me hear you say
I'm with it
Can't live without it
Can't play the game no more so I'm doing something about it
And I want it
Yeah, I'm on it
Searching far and wide to find the girl for me, yeah

[Verse 2: Tyga]
It's times like this that make me really wonder
Who the real bitches and who the real fronters
Who the real image and who this blocked number
Who would I call on collect in the prison
For a one one, couldn't tell me nothing
Who is this mystery person I called on
Can't get calls, when your phone's off
And the bill's due, and the food gone
I need a shorty like Lee-Ray
Who could wheel big bodies on the freeways
New Mercedes, through the Palisades
Back to the pool palace where we can lay
Shrimp all day, shit, it's my place
Ain't never got to see a broke nigga face
When you feel alone, just think of me
Sing along girl, remember what the song sing

[Hook]
I don't want no party girl, sneaking over town
Just need me someone who can cool it down
Make me feel like love is easy
If love is all you need, then let me hear you say
I'm with it
Can't live without it
Can't play the game no more so I'm doing something about it
And I want it
Yeah, I'm on it
Searching far and wide to find the girl for me, yeah
