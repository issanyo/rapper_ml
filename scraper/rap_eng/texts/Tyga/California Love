[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
We met at city walk, universal studios
Uhh so beautifullll
Truly cold
Shawty need a movie role
I am not an actor but I'm stickin to da script
And Tony Montana had me stickin to the blimp
But now I got an actress stickin to my hip
And she hit me with her fubbb
You can roll the credits, and shawty is my fetish
And you know I like em redish and shawty is reddish
You know I like em fast and shawty is the last number on my dash
Uh, speedin like a cop behind me
Tryna catch up wit this girl like some 57 Heinz
And you deserve lobster mami
So how bout I make reservations at crustaceans for now
Table for two, just me and you, some drinks and some food
Couple yeah I know's a couple jokes
A couple cries a couple girl I know you lying, lines
Cup of Patrón
Cup of Dom Pérignon, cup of hound
Cup of moans, couple groans
Couple ground, and we get our couple on
And her goodies so good I can't make a bad sound
And her pussy so good wish I could wear it for cologne
And her pussy so wet I wish I slip and break my neck
And I took her to Rodeo she shop all day-o
And I fucked her Hollywood ass like she was from Vallejo

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I wish they all could be California girls
California ca ca California
Man I wish dey could be Californa girls
California ca ca California
She my California love
My California love
That girl's my California love
My California love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhh but shawty got the nerve doe
Cuz now she telling me to stop, now she said she wanna stop
Now I'm callin one stop, where the purple? Like where the purple?
And my mama told me never hurt a woman but what if that woman hurt me
And they say love is priceless but right now it's dirt cheap
And we say we will fight this until round 13
But just like Mike Tyson we were not sure thing
We were only biting on a dream
In that boxing ring
And in dat box is a ring... a ring
Now somebody call Don King
And tell him shawty give me back my ring
Shawty give me back my ring
And the bell went ding

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Uhhh my Cali's consist from Compton to the Valley
A few stallions in Rancho Cucamongo
So run those they say waitin patiently like a drumroll
From my area codes got em all from 213 310 323
Oh, I got bad one up in Carson
Soon as we met her heart stuck, she gorgeous, I'm falling
Can't fall though never been my morals, just plenty oral
