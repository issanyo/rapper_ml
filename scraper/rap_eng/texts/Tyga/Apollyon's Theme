[Verse 1: Tyga]
Shamed on, played on, motherfucking hated on
Hated misery so I keep my company gone
Six blondes, no bras, begging me to fuck em raw
Only with a rubber on, get served rawly raw
Sick world living in, pissing in the whirlpool
Last dollars on this coffee table, but i’m good
Head to the sky, praying like Christ would
It’s hard to level when all of us harvest from the ghetto
You are fellows, get marshmellowed, your so sparrow
Waking up on god’s green, bloody on your knees
These malt liquor vendors sell it to you no ID
These young niggers hot on pills down one degree
My art speaks illustrated it on the beat
If all fails at least I live with memories
Judgement day, my only day of death
So motherfucker dont you test me, nigga

[Hook: Tyga]
I came rolled in a break
Your a real hater I can see it on your face
You don’t wanna do that
Motherfucker, you don’t wanna do that
No, been hustling all my life
I wanna do right, road to success only way to survive
So I gotta do that, yeah I gotta do that
Motherfucker, let the angels sing
Oh, oh, oh, do that
Oh, oh, oh
Let the angels sing
Oh, oh, oh, do that
Oh, oh, oh
Apollyons theme

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, how you say you innocent, illegitimate children
Anger hurts, who feels it all this resentment
Fuck em, middle finger never bent
Only at the lord’s gates judging me to let me in
It’s funny when these federal bills spent in from ceilings
Since they figured it in back turns, no friends
I’m only human fly as donatella 'sace
We all die soon like gianni, no autopsy
Hard body, funerals invite only
Body eroded get you buried with black roses
Time told by a rolly quarter on my arm
Fifty thou, keep the Reaper blinded by your charm
Get money like i’m Jewish
Cheaper than the newest, all my girls indian style like buddhist
Hands to their booties that’s my call of duty
Motherfucker toodles
