[Intro: Keyshia Cole]
Drumma Boy

La-la-lalala, La-la-lalala, La-la-la-lalala

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Come with me, oh
Are you riding with me?
I’m pulling up right now
Are you down to ride?
La-la-la-la, la, la, la, la
Come with me, oh
Are you riding with me?
I’m pulling up right now
Are you down to ride?
La-la-la-la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
In the hood, I’m good—yeah, ya feel me (I’m good)
Came up on the plug—yeah, ya feel me (I’m good)
I’m a Town chick, you gon’ get the real me
We gon’ jump out on her, and make ‘em feel me
If I gave you my love, we official
Got them young thugs waiting in the trenches
100, nothin’ fake about me
She better watch what she say about me

[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Oh, pretty chick, ski mask
Pop up, pull off fast, call me, don’t call back
Leave me, don’t come back
I’m with the shit and all that
Ganged up and all that, but you already knew that
You a fan on some other sh…
As you was laying with that other chick
Not tonight, not tonight
Make a chick wake up, hop up, catch a flight

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Come with me (Oh, are you riding?)
Are you riding with me?
I’m pulling up right now (Right now)
Are you down to ride? (Let’s ride)
La-la-la-la, la, la, la, la
Come with me
Are you riding with me?
I’m pulling up right now
Are you down to ride?
La-la-la-la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2: Kamaiyah]
I got some bitches outside that’ll ride for me
No lie, two times, they’ll die for me
Without a question, they’ll pull a homicide for me
Bust out your windows and every fuckin’ tire for me
So if you want that, we about that
Pay the bill, never tell, we’ll bounce back
And we’ll still pull up outside where your house at
Up on your rat ass bitch, straight with a mouse trap
Don’t get to talkin’ out your neck when you keep texting me
Get that ass in check and have respect for me
I got some down ass chicks straight to the left of me
Don’t appreciate the way you been neglecting me
So clear, don’t ever get it twisted
You do your dirt, you better do it from a distance
Them loco thots on general assistance
Fuck them other bitches, I ride for my bitches

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
Come with me (Oh, ay)
Are you riding with me?
I’m pulling up right now
Are you down to ride?
La-la-la-la, la, la, la, la
Come with me (Hey, are you riding?)
Are you riding with me?
I’m pulling up right now (Right now)
Are you down to ride? (Right now)
La-la-la-la, la, la, la, la
