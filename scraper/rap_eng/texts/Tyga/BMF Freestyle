[Tyga]
First of all, I ain't feeling y’all, feel the fucking heat defrost
Spill the spoon full of food, ain't enough to feed the room
I don’t have to fucking goon, twizzler boy split you too
Cherry red Rover roof, Crips to confuse you
You can say I blue’s you, better than I bruised you
All you niggas copycats, doing shit I used to
Oh you tatted too, nigga fuck you
My bitch ain't got no tats, I hit it from the back
I spend South of France, all that other shit is whack
Sling shot it in the ear than I let the shit collapse
Money is my pet peeve, give me hourly
If there is none at all, then I’m pissed off
I listen to Rick Ross and I know Ricky Ross
I’m Leonardo in Inception, reserve my section
I do dreams, put you in a Bubble, Benz or Lexus
I Will Smith the necklace, I do it effortless
Bitch all eyes on me, the future’s in my eyes
Money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga jealous, then the motherfucker dies
Figure you ain't scary if you did the crime
Now prepare, it's dinnertime, dimmer the lights, lemon with ice
Look in it twice, it's fizzling Sprite
Brown do the belly nice, no Coca Cola, I don’t drink soda
Black beanie nigga like a fucking smoker
They say I’m about to blow up like super nova
Put your helmet on, the bulldozing dopest
How you shitting on ‘em and ain't got shit up on ‘em?
It kills me to know it, you Melanie Fiona
Oh, remove yourself from my scrotum
Oh, remove yourself, remove yourself
Oh, remove yourself from my scrotum
Pull your ho card, I thought I told you oh
