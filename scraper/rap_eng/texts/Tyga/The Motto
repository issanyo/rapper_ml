I'm the fuckin' man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go uptown, New York City bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, fuckin' women ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uhh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla wen ever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune "light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm fuckin' with her, I don't really need her
Ahhh, That's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal
Real nigga wassap

[Chorus]
Now she want a photo Ya
You already know though
You only live once, that's the motto nigga YOLO
We 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga wassup?

One, time fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven, grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, torn down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid, off with your head!
Nigga money talks and Mr Ed! Ya
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God Becky look at her butt

Tunechi

[Chorus]
Wassap wassap
Real nigga wassup
Real nigga wassup

[Chorus]
Wassap, wassap
