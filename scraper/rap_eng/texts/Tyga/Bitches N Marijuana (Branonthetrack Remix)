[Hook: Chris Brown]
You can tell by the way I walk that I got 'em
Peel any girl that I wanna, got bitches and marijuana
I can tell by the way you move that you a problem
Peel any girl that I wanna, got bitches and marijuana
I got 'em, I got 'em
Ooh, she dance, she don't do it for free
I got 'em, I got 'em
Got bitches and marijuana

[Verse 1: Branonthetrack]
Treat my bitches like a blunt, hit it, pass it on
I don't do no foreplay, I just get it on
Say she wanna get it, while we play my songs
Bang bang like the base then she go home (bye, bitch)
They know, they know that I got it
2 grams in the blunt, blow like Bob Marley
Kickin' back with yo' chick, it's like a hobby
What they don't see doesn't hurt, don't tell nobody, nah
I can get you higher (higher, higher)
But don't play wit' it, nah
Baby, ride me like a Mercedes
Kill that pussy one time, now that's a 180-7
Uh, you better cuff yo' chick
You shoulda seen the way she roll that stick
She was puffin' all night, yeah, she got all lit
I can tell she never get enough of this, nah

[Hook: Chris Brown]
You can tell by the way I walk that I got 'em
Peel any girl that I wanna, got bitches and marijuana
I can tell by the way you move that you a problem
(you a problem)
Peel any girl that I wanna, got bitches and marijuana
I got 'em, I got 'em
Ooh, she dance, she don't do it for free
I got 'em, I got 'em
Got bitches and marijuana

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Pull up, got the fat sack
With some clean motherfuckers, no hood rats
Yeah we suited and booted, you know your bitch 'bout to toot it
She want love from a nigga, that's a heart attack, yack
Loud pack, give me all of that
Don't be sending naked pics cause my phone tapped
Black mask, duffel bag and a hundred racks
I don't snitch but I could show you where the money at
Me nigga
It's right here
Got girls and they all on my lap, they with me nigga
Hell yeah
You see the Lambo parked in the trap, that's me nigga
I own it while you living on a lease nigga
I'm known to keep my bitches on a leash nigga
I smoke it by the pound, what you talking 'bout?
I dick your bitch down then I walk it out

[Hook: Chris Brown]
You can tell by the way I walk that I got 'em
Peel any girl that I wanna, got bitches and marijuana
I can tell by the way you move that you a problem
(you a problem)
Peel any girl that I wanna, got bitches and marijuana
I got 'em, I got 'em
Ooh, she dance, she don't do it for free
I got 'em, I got 'em
Got bitches and marijuana
