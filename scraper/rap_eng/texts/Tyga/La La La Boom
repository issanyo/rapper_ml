[Intro]
Hahaha
Tyga
Put the headphones up
I need to hear that Boom
That Boom

[Hook]
I'm in a Range Rove
That'll make way, ho
Cuz you don't wanna hear
That LaLaLaLaLa go Boom
Bring the damn door
If the boys say so
Cuz you don't wanna hear
That LaLaLaLaLa go Boom Boom Boom
That LaLaLa go Boom Boom Boom
That LaLaLa go Boom Boom Boom
That LaLaLa {Uh!}
That LaLaLa {Uh!}
That LaLaLa go Boom

[Verse 1]
Main nigga
I trash homes call him may nigga
I mow hoes -- Take that clay off your face, bitches
I break the news like Sway, bitches
Get up, like sit ups
My swagga skate hoes, Give them hick ups
Beg to differ
Back to begging for pot stickers
I shot some shots you never knew existed, nigga
I'm Jiminy Cricket, These liers, they never wanna listen
Take her to Disney, bitch Minnie tryna act Mickey
I'm tryna hit like Griffey
I ain't looking for a queen like the nigga Simmey
Young King like Bibby
Plus of course I got my heart with me -- Duh I'm young Money *bun jumping and 100's bun beat bumping
Ain't saying nothing
Haters talking but they muffling
Damn Louis earmuff shits is so disgusting
No Muffin man
I stay in jewelery lane
I'm so Varmin, Doctor get the comet when I'm rhyming

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Like cartoons make the car do a U like horseshoes
Ahchoo!
Allergic to rules
I break threw like pimples
Dude, you ain't shit
Get the doo doo
Throw out your do
Wait for the nurse
It's just a little boo boo
Got a ghetto chick who love bamboos
Them little sandals that Jesus made just for you
I guess it's true
Can't be a player forever
Who fucking asked you?
I'm 19 -- Roaming
Living life like the Romans do
I salute absolutely you can guzzle Absolut
Yes I'm Chewbacc-o
Chachoo!
Sniff this crazy glue
Then maybe you can be crazy like me too -- There's a clue
I ain't tryna raise a little baby, I just wanna scoot
Fill up tour, with bullets to aim at you
Guns that's so dangerous I'd rather throw you to the moon
Tell the boys "I don't know what happened. Think his body flew" -- Welcome to my zoo
Tonight you're Tyga's soup and I got the flu -- Achoo!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
OMG -- I'm peaking the Z
Mobile if the money is free
New York timing meets and Cali summertime, they adding me
Surrally, if this shit ain't free
I work for me and only me
You bitches looking kinda cheap
I'm only paid the finest fee
No buying
Big diamonds
Loves priceless
You hate me?
Bitch I hate not grinding
GED, SBQ, Gata, JT, Rail
No Arch right, Ronix, sorry if I forgot ya
Hell, your not worth it
Just affiliates like Drama
I been balling
Shout out to Ben Baller
I'm up in Harlem
What up Teyana
Taylor, my off mommy suit, nigga
I'm just balling

[Hook]
