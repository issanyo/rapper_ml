Bitch, I’m Honey Cocaine bout to bring in some pain
All my haters like a choir they all singing my name
Ain't got a heart for a broad thats the rule of the game
Now you a fool if you aim, I’ll put a tool to ya brain
I’m bout to get it, then spend it if I said it I meant it
Fuck your feelings, taste my weapons act like a bitch I’ll erase yo blessings yo
You are not familiar with me if you caught makin a move bitch your visitor is me

[Tyga]

Now if you see me around your ways dont holla at me

Listen you rats here just a count for me you ain't me homie you just act like me
Well you should watch your actions please cause there might be some casualties (auugh)
They about to witness it, last kings but Im still on my queen shit (schwag)

[Tyga]
Aim at yo membrane just for saying im insane and yo girl give me neck
Hang man I ain't playing I never did lie lay around and open yo thighs
Nigga gone pop like fish gone fry, niggas talking greasy like the shit gone slide

Middle finger to the middle of yo eyes, young young ty T-Raww need a heisman AUGH!
Honey Cocaine!
