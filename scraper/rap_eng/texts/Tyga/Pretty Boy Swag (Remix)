[Verse 1:Tyga]
This right here
I'm about to re-kill
Cock it in yo ear
Resurrect and disappear
Bitch I'm bigger, you small
I be clowin' calls
And your just a funny guy, little duval
Bitch I'm a beast, man, dog
Licking the blood up off my paws
Filling my cup up, silly straw
7-Eleven, slurp me off
Put her beaver on my log
Then she lick lick like a frog
Pretty boy I'm not at all
I'm just way fresher than ya'll
Nigga damn, always talkin' to bitches not my age
Yea I'm young, you old, so put these babies on yo face
Tender love baby face
Say she want it everyday, but once I hit it it ain't the same
Ash-ley Mary Kate, haha
Oh shit full house it's a pool party
Heres the address use Google mami
Smell the Herm√©s
Or it's Bvlgari
Treat my bitches like assistants
Now you work for me
Spazz man
All about gettin' my cash fast
I'm totally rad, show her my tats
Flippin the bird, turnin' my back
No love, my heart will be back
Bury your tongue in my lap
I ain't even write shit after that
Okay look up bitch I'm flexin
Penthouse level leave you naked
Eat your heart out bitch I'm Jeffrey
Dahmer Damier my luggage
Lucky lefty I'm right handed
I'm crazy I'm just sayin
Nickles, dimes, quarters, grams
I don't smoke, this for Trell
Roll the L while we here
Plus the plane leaving in ten
I got models I got friends
But I never spend on them
Only circle that I'm in, is the circle of success
Fuck stress, have sex
And I do that shit the best, aww
