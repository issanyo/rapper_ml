[Intro: Chris Brown]
I told her "fuck that nigga"
(Woop! Uh, I said woop! It's the remix)

(Mustard on the beat ho)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her "Fuck that nigga"
(I don't know ya)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
We sitting in the back of the club
Table got a rope in the front (I don't know ya)
Uhh you looking real familiar, I could just be a lil' drunk
I don't know your name, it's a goddamn shame
I don't know how to explain it for ya
But, girl, I'm just saying
If you got a man back home, I don't know him
What, just keep it on the hush
Pocket full of trees, don't beat around the bush
Walk on green, I can even hear the putt
K.O shawty when I hit her with a punchline
Get a couple shots when it's crunch time
Ducking from my ex like a one time
Throw a sign when you really tryn' go
Got the car parked right at the door

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her "Fuck that nigga"
(I don't know ya)

[Verse 2: Tyga]

A-all on my line with the same text
Fresh off the P.Jet tryna get your pussy wet
You super ready, shawty I know that
If homie got a problem, we address him, tell him hold that
Tort that
All my niggas flame up the yoda
We could leave in the roaster
Doing shit you ain't suppose ta
Rozzay, rolex, sex in your new Lex
Got a lot of condos I could put you in one
RAW
T-raw I'm something like your papi now, she getting use to me
She happy now, watching bridesmaids, think she got it made now
Ass up, face down, puff, pass the weed around
Young hitter, she just wanna doggy style
Pumping snoop album now, balling on the balcony
What's your name.. Natalie
I ain't even asking ya, I just know you bad as fuck
BUT I DON'T

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her "Fuck that nigga"
(I don't know ya)

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Nah, and you don't know my name, no
Just in case you' the feds, I don't know ya
Uh I might'a poured you a drink
But don't let it go to your head
I know why you .... came
Tryna be my main chick (yeah)
Passenger side when I lane switch
Top back, two seats only
Ain't no room for your friends, I don't know them
We just seizing the moment
Up all night, throw a deuce to the morning (wait)
Fly mo'fucka, everything is imported (wait)
Don't try to act too important
I know your game
You got a gang of niggas, all over you
But you all over here, on me (on me)
Girl, I ain't tryna dog ya (nope)
Bad bitch only thing I'll call you
