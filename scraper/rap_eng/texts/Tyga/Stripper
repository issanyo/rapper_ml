Yo panties all in a bunch
Well you can suck my dick
All these chicks are ridiculous
Conversations is fibbilous
Man, fuck all these bitches
I am a polygamist
Playing with me pussy
I am just that bored
I mean we coulda' went shopping
But what could you afford?
I bus the benz in the pit
My money can't fit in clips
I tell the hoes when they strip
That they can play with my clit

Ooooooh, boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, lotta booooooobs
Man, I make the baddest bitches send me nuuuuudes
I ain't got no time for your silly feuuuuuuuds

I'm wit pretty gang assues, rendezvous
Batman, I'm robbin hoes
I tell them bitches you bombin' those
These hoes my sons
I'm papa though
I feed them bitches with papa dough
I'm tropical, you comical
Bitch read my muh fuckin' chronicle
You my son, son, prodigal
And you adopted, not even biological

Hey bitch, I'm T-Raw
Get on that pole and free fall
Heard my best friend fucked with you
I said that's cool now you do too
Gettin' head in the carpool
Her mouth draw like our school
Anaconda, part 2
I pulled it out, that's all you, all you
I'm tryna smash
I got the cash
She got the ass
Now tell your friends I'm a lil' nigga wit a big one
Ain't tryna brag
I'm e linin' that strip club
That money; got a quarter back
I make a hike, go long
First down, thats ten racks
She said I can't fuck for free
I told her that's cool by me
Said I can't fuck for free
She gon probably have to pay me
Gettin' dizzy; all I do is spin
White ghost; I'm floatin'
She up and down that pole
But she ain't votin'

I bust a van in the vip and I support these strippers
She bust it down to a split, she got a horse ass with her
She tryna bring home a friend and I enforce that nigga
I threw like 4 stacks nigga
And then 4 more stacks nigga
I'm only just gettin' started, I blew a porsche that minute
It's king of diamonds so starless onyx; my whore got bitter
Cuz I ain't call her this mornin'; she almost torched my shit
When I hit a shopping spree; oh shit I ball
Sorry but you can't get these at lenox mall
Nah hoe this ain't clearance at Americana
Ditch that boy you better cuff ya baby mama
Copy, kinko, for Nicki show; that pinke hole
Drop it, bust it, open on the head; Ochocinco
I support these ratchet bitches and I treat em right
She fought me to get to Nicki, that's that shit I like
