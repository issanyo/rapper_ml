Pour the Ciroc, yeah, I'm Puff Daddy
I need that girl that'll ri-ri-ride (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I need a girl, girlfriend (yeah, I'm with you)
But I'm with you, spendin' most of my time
Does that make you my girl, uh, girlfriend?
Hoes text, I don't reply, baby mad like you must have a girl
Girlfriend, ooh, I think I like her (my girlfriend)
I want that girl to be my girl
'Cause when it's cold outside
I just lay up with bae

[Verse 1]
Fuckin' with my girl
Diamonds dancin' in the club with my girl
Nigga, don't be bumpin' into my girl
Bruh, this ain't no thottie, bruh, this ain't just anybody
I can't trust anybody but my girl
Spice girl, your smile lights up my world
Like a moth to a flame, my love is blind, you see my desires
I'm never sober, gettin' higher and higher with my girl
Yeah, I'm Puff Daddy, I need a girl that'll ri-ri-ride
Pour the Ciroc, yeah, yeah, I'm Puff Daddy, I need a girl in my life

[Chorus]
Will you be my girlfriend? (Yeah, I'm with you)
But I'm with you, spendin' most of my time
Does that make you my girl, uh, girlfriend?
Hoes text, I don't reply, baby mad like you must have a girl
Girlfriend, ooh, I think I like her (my girlfriend)
I want that girl to be my girl
'Cause when it's cold outside
I just lay up with bae

[Post-Chorus]
Fuckin' with my girl
Ooh, my, my, my, my girlfriend
My girl
Ooh, my, my, my, my girlfriend

[Verse 2]
My girl is better than yours, aha, is wetter than yours, aha
She comin' to see me like I'm goin' on tour
I remember when she was unsure, oh, ayy
I had to call her and call her some more
Now when we coppin', we call up the store
But the Porsche don't ri-ride right, my girl ain't inside it
My wrist like Visene, her wrist just like mine
Crown and you're rich, you're my queen
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl

[Chorus]
I want you to be my girlfriend (yeah, I'm with you)
But I'm with you, spendin' most of my time
Does that make you my girl, uh, girlfriend?
Hoes text, I don't reply, baby mad like you must have a girl
Girlfriend, ooh, I think I like her (my girlfriend)
I want that girl to be my girl
'Cause when it's cold outside
I just lay up with bae

[Post-Chorus]
Fuckin' with my girl
Ooh, my, my, my, my girlfriend
Fuckin' with my girl, my girl, my girl
