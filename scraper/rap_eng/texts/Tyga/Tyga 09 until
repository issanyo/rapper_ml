(TYGA)

This is why im ill
This this is why im ill
09 untill

(verse)
Dial up seven digits
Car stripper, trife livin'
Show you what I'm paid but you won't get it
Already spent it, hundred thou? 16?
Make you feel like the richest No! niggas
What happen when them cloths won't fit ya
And everybody asking for pictures
Onto the next One fan say I'm sick man, others say my shit weak
I do not sweat them
I am but a risk, risk, band
Young money mulligan play golf on ya' head
Swing swing like lesbians and a man
Don't wanna share his wife but we already did, bitch
Ghetto fly nigga form his ship
Its like amistad all black when we dip ah
Car with with rims, don't matter what we in, cuz we already in, forever the end
Chivalry I good night this shit
Goodbye to the flaw say hello to you God
Readin the choir overseas ummm....
Such a globe traveller
Far chilin', while you where at home
I was busy ordering steaks through the phone
Like medium rare, no wait well done
Don't care if you won
Tyga I am the one

(Chorus)
This is why im ill 09 until
This this is why im ill 09 until
This this is why im ill 09 until
F-f-f-fff-forever yall'

I really kick flow
I really been broke
Look at me now doe everynight another show
What are those doe
Glow in the dark shoes
How'd you get those
Wish I really knew
Like mario, my city red and blue
Born from L.A. eat roscoes
Lucy tacos throw some vatos
Tat tatted too ink like Kinkos
I put a dollar in the pot watch the pot grow
I pop up with the heat like hot toast
You would be psycho if you see what I knew
So keep your eyes closed and lower your IQ
I feel like two, they can judge me but there's no gaffle and stool
Only gospel can save you good music you're immune
I'm flu, sick my lyrics like puke

(Chorus)
