[Verse]
Pay me on the first, niggas know I broke the curse
How it feel when the roles is reversed? Nigga got it out the dirt
Bad bitches 'round, I'ma flirt and I'm goin' for my eighth like Kerr
Do you concur? Catch me if you can lil' purp
I go Kyrie Curry on the verse, ball like a Nerf
Meet me on the turf, I don't mean Pharrell group, but these niggas nerds
Full of that syrup, you will get served
My niggas make you hide your face like H.E.R
And I like her, titties and furs
Big green Phantom got 'em hooked, Larry Bird
Give 'em the bird, fuck what you heard, I'm the best rap-per-er
Niggas call me tiger, that's whiter than a iceberg
I'm nicer than your favorite rapper on percs
I might curve if she don't got good slurp
Be nicer, put you on a R.I.P shirt
Yes sir, ridin' in a two-seater
I love Hov but I still gotta bang Ether
Believe it or not, came back from the sunken, now I'm cream of the crop
I need cash on spot, I don't want the deposit
I got DMs from every IG thot
But I'm locked in, studio 24-7
I just popped in, fuckin' with the Leakers, when I leave, its gon' reek here
On my way to yo' house, my girl's top tier
If we talkin' overall, I'm top ten
Flows, cars, bitches, ice
King in Dubai like fuck the price
Lookin' at yours, I'm like "fuck my life"
Lookin' at yours, I'm like "you're right"
I might go psych, go might (might, might might)
It's redrum, on sight (sight, sight, sight)
Bitch, I'm always right
Everybody wanna be like Mike
Big bank take lil' bank
Ayy, fuck around, I need another bank
Ayy, thirteen hundred stars in the Wraith
Woo, and I'm on that forty-two man
Yeah, big bank take lil' bank
Uh, this my shit when I'm in the Wraith
And my Maybach up to date
