[Chorus]
All I see is black crowns
King me ‘cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
‘Cause all I see on me is black crowns
Black crowns

[Verse 1]
Uhh, heavenly father, appoint me to the coronation
I deserve it, brought music for clarification
Envision my past, Egypt reincarnated
Negativity hill, over the hump camels waiting
Never gave up, most of my peers forsaken
One make it, we all make it but i was never that patient
King chronicles, never write it too logical
Fake niggas saying 'What up, fam?' but we ain’t biological
Hands down to my mother, she the greatest ever
Since I was the only child, wasn’t too much to stress her
Waking up before work, leaving allowance on the dresser
Raising the prince under pressure, no king, no refuge
It’s all good, got homies like Boyz n the Hood
We all good, I mean no matter what circumstances was
Champagne, weed, pills, it do the same
These niggas gassed up, too much butane
Working hard like one day I’ll afford the 4-door Porsche
Approaching every corner cautious
Too much shopping, niggas calling you a target
Too much flossing, niggas gossiping in your blog shit
I rather put one in the air, congratulate careers
Death defying moments, people that I ain’t seen in years
What you running from when you you’re your only fear?
Guess my time is here…
Now..

[Chorus]
All I see is black crowns
King me ‘cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
‘Cause all I see on me is black crowns
Black crowns

[Verse 2]
Uhh, fatigue, I’m feeling jaded
She gave me the number but I ain’t never saved it
Shit is solid, why these niggas played it?
Dealt the right cards, but I have yet to play it
Determine payrolls, living the lifestyle
You couldn’t be in if you was to see it right now
I think I see it right now
They judge me every day, life on trial
Take your money, niggas betting on my downfall
Many all real hoes, bitches gonna call
Five fingers, pledge allegiance to my one God
We’d have been through hell, so heaven ain’t far
Two cars sedans, tearing it on the way to the Grammys
Guess we nominated, guess they appreciate us
These niggas often imitate us
We just stay creative

[Chorus]
All I see is black crowns
King me ‘cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
‘Cause all I see on me is black crowns
Black crowns

[Bridge]
One time in the, one time in the air for the…
Two, two, two times in the, two times in the air for the…
Both hands, both hands, both hands in the air for the…
One time, two times, times…

[Outro: Tyga’s Mother]
Just wanted to call to let you know how proud I am
Sweetie, this album is amazing
I have never imagined that God would bless you so much
As he is going to continue to bless you
He’s already made you the king that you are
Only one to wear the black crown
Well, I just want you to know how much I love you
And how awesome you are
And how I am so, so honored to have a son as yourself
I could never have ask for more, you’re just amazing
And I am just so excited for this album
I think this album is definitely your baby
And it’s definitely gonna be heard by a lot of people
And a lot of people are going to love it
They’re gonna love it, love it, love it
And God’s gonna continue to bless you with all the talents that you…
I’m just so proud, I just wanna shed a tear right now
OK mommy loves you and you the best thing ever
You are my heart. I love you sweetie, bye bye
