Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks

[Verse 1: YG]
Aye, uh
Got this bitch named Tar, she let me fuck her in the car
Like Kim Kardashian, she wanna be a star
Got this bitch named Britanny with big ass titties
But bitches ain't shit, 'cause bitches act Mickey (ughhhhh)
Got a main bitch but I don't need her
Every time we fuck, I gotta pop a bean first
Hit the purp then eat that pussy for dessert
It gets worse, just watch when she squirt
I got this bitch who act Sidity
She live in the 60s
Every time she hear I got a new bitch, she says she miss me
I'm a thug, got this thug bitch, she stay up in the Jungles
Every time we go to Crenshaw Mall, she have a rumble
Got this bitch in the Hoovers, I don't wanna lose her
Ass so fat to measure it, I need a ruler
Got this bad bitch, that go to North-ridge
She always wear Gucci, but she can't afford it

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Take a bitch life, now it's my life
Need a bitch that can fuck, cook, clean, right
Turn a bitch out, make her lick twice
Yeah she eat pussy, but she don't fuck dykes
Laid in the middle, two Miller Lites
Straight kill a bitch, pop rocks little sprite
Bam bam, little chubby ass gooey car
Tell the bitch: "twinkle, twinkle come meet a star"
I don't Odom, no Lamar
Kind of money make her come out her Leotard
I'm in this bitch, like my dick hard
And I shuffle money, like playing cards
Ussssssss
YG tell them bitches what's up, they ready to cut no
Links in my suit, we don't cuff em
Straight duck em, Like Donald
Quack qwuck
I don't even know the sound them bitches make cause...

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I like bitches, that's lightskinned-ed
With a whole a lot of ass, and get right with it
Off a pill, I can probably make her like bitches
Lick lick it, like a lolli till it's like liquid
These hoochies always talking bout, where my dick is
But if it's not in your mouth, then get out my business
A nigga real ratchet, I ain't wifin' shit
Known to fuck and cut her off, light switches
Uh, now what I get? Money bitch
You look good, but to me you just a bummy bitch
And the funny shit is, you know my other bitch
Met me through her, on some under cover lover shit
Got damn, ain't that your home-girl?
Scandalous bitches, we living in a cold world
That's why I flip em, flip em like ah zone girl
And every week I change my number to my phone cause...
