Ohh Its Hot

[Verse 1: Dawn]
Love it when I'm flexin' up in my car
Door swing, open from my passenger
Look up in the mirror, fix my mascara
People wanna know who the hell is her
Drop top ride in my coop deVille
I stay mobbing in my hoopty still
Rattling in the trunk when I play the track
Swerve to the left, yelling holler back

[Hook: Shannon]
Ooh, these haters got a sour look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
Ohh, they lookin' so thirsty
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade

[Verse 2: Aubrey]
I feel your eyes on me
I like how it feels
I hope that you enjoy your five
But I'll take it from here
I'm late to the party, but I'm always on time
Misunderstood, but I'm always on your mind

[Chorus: DK]
Who cares if we turn up every night the top down
When we pull up at the light
Don't listen to what nobody say
So loud, I can't hear nobody say nothing
I wish you would say something
While me and my girls is stuntin'
Ain't no problems here
See, I'm just trying to have me a good time

[Hook: Shannon]
Ooh, these haters got a sour look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
Ohh, they lookin' so thirsty
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade

[Verse 3: Dawn]
I'm rockin' my sunnie's
To block all this shade
We out here setting up shop
Singin' lemonade
I'm late to the party, but I'm always on time
Misbehaving, always up to no good

[Chorus: DK]
Who cares if we turn up every night the top down
When we pull up at the light
Don't listen to what nobody say
So loud, I can't hear nobody say nothing
I wish you would say something
While me and my girls is stuntin'
Ain't no problems here
See, I'm just trying to have me a good time

[Hook: Shannon]
Ooh, these haters got a sour look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
Ohh, they lookin' so thirsty
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade

[Verse 4: Tyga]
What you mad for
Is it me or nah?
The ice in my charm
Forget no flaws, I'm daddy T-Raww, trips around the world
I'm open arms to a door, you my chicks spoil
Be loyal, lord I'm royal
Whippin' that brief, catch a case if they try follow
She top dollar!
No Benz, already got it
Intoxicated, faded how we got home?
Glad we made it, I know they hate it
Smirk on their faces, blue in the face
Smurf faces what I do for you
More than the bank statement
What she do for me?
You know that tongue crazy
I like that I like that
I'm so serious, she kiss it
I like that, don't bite that
I like that, go like that
Come right back, she right back
Are you mad, my chick bad?

[Hook: Shannon]
Ooh, these haters got a sour look upon their face
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
Ohh, they lookin' so thirsty
They might just need a drink
Lemonade lemonade
Lemonade lemonade
