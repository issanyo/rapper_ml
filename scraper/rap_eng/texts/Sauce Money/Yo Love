[Blackstreet]
Oh, oh, I
Oh, oh, I
Get higher, baby (Uh, yo)
Get higher, baby (Catch the beat)
Get higher, baby (Ugh, yo)
Get higher, baby (Yo, yo, yo, yo)
Get higher, baby (Ugh)
Get higher, baby (Yo, oh)
Get higher, baby (Um, um, um)

All day long I've been thinking 'bout you, baby
The way you kiss me girl, it's driving me crazy
All I want is to be with you, girl
Baby girl, can't you see that I

I know the time is right
I've been thinking about you every night
I just wanna be with you
I'll be there for you
Take good care of you
Yo, yo, yo

1 - 	Yo love
	It's the kind of love
	That make a brother wanna check yo' game
	Yo love
	It's the kind of love
	Don't cause no stress, no pain
	Yo love
	It's the kind of love
	That make my dogs just wanna flip
	Yo love
	Yo this is Blackstreet, baby
	And you know we won't abandon ship, feel me now

I'm on a mission and it is to get with you
When we get together, maybe we can zoom zoom
We can spend the night so I can meet you at the top
To feel ya drip, drop, honey love

When we're making love to this groove
Let's make it right, girl
I just wanna see you every night
I wanna be with you
So, baby, don't let me down tonight
Yo, yo, yo

Repeat 1

[Sauce Money]
This is not a faze
I go downtown like Dr. J's
Can't nobody stop my ways
Sauce Money at your service
You deserve not to be nervous
She said 'I like the way you work it'
Course you do
You know my flow is true
Sound like No Diggity Part 2
Maybe not though, still hot, though
Rip up a track
Goin' to Blackstreet so I can pick up my plaque
What you need me to bring back?
Mil, platinum earrings and silk
Gucci towels with the Cristal, sure baby
Just a few acres so your dream house can get built
Well, I got that
All I got to do is rock a hot track
Them Blackstreet cats got a lot
You can't defeat 'em
You know the saying
'If you can't beat 'em'
Cuz once you went to look it was too hard to see 'em
Well, I love you so much
That I'mma make sure you never meet 'em

[Blackstreet]
Now that the time is right, yeah
I just wanna see you every night
I wanna be with you
So, baby, don't let me down tonight

Repeat 1 until fade
