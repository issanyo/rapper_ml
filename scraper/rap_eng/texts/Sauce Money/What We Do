[Intro: Sauce Money]
Yo, yo Bleek man, what the fuck nigga?
Fuck them hoes man
Fuck them bitches though, digits though
What I like
Uh, uh, uh, uh, what what
I bet y'all think this some love song shit
Sadly mistaken

[Verse 1: Sauce Money]
I like to do 20 wild chicks scoping my whip
Do shows across the country getting dough for my shit
Looking in the face of rappers while they hoping I quit
Still spit the flyest shit to keep 'em grossing my hits
I like to never ever let my tongue touch it in the sex
Like to exercise one week say fuck it the next
Like to write four whole songs and three skits a day
Talk shit with Tyrina, and do hits with Jay
I like to write for other people keep 'em loving a nigga
On the low love the dough plus make my publishing bigger
Is it worth a million yet? That's what they say now
Long distance, California, let me call Jay Brown
Hear the story often from cappa who was first to strive
Rule one for money: Sauce keep thirst alive
Like to share the feel with fam when I invent that hit
Like to scream {*} and represent that shit, what?

[Chorus: Sauce Money]
Just, some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things that you like to do
Whether with a chick, for dolo or with your crew
What it is is what is is, this is what we do
Just, some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things that you like to do
Whether with a chick, for dolo or with your crew
What it is is what it is, this is what we do

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
I like to get my hustle on and make loot all day
Spit game at these chicks, smoke in the hallway
Know how I feel about you right next to F
Like to shop Tom D's, stay fresh to def
I like to analyze Jigga, man D'Evils is deep
Late night I hit these hoes while they peoples asleep
I like to wake up in the afternoon religiously
I won a thou' last night fuck school I'ma spend this G
I like to tell fake thugs man they soft as nerds
Like they drink in front of the heat and take off the skirt
Like when chicks try to make a scene to provoke me to hit her
Handle that diplomatic and try to fuck they sister
Like to stay away from hoes I heard caught a disease
Like to do shows and then hit moms off with some cheese
Everything I spit blaze, never a sentence weak
Now I like to grab my dick and say "Bitch I'm Memphis Bleek!"
What?

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]
Just, some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things that you like to do
Whether with a chick, for dolo or with your crew
What it is is what is is, this is what we do
Just, some of things that we like to do
Pretty sure some things that you like to do
Whether with a chick, for dolo or with your crew
What it is is what it is, this is what we do

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek, Sauce Money & Both]
I like to ride shotgun, roll my dro' in the coupe
Like to go gold with you and hold my guns on the stoop
Like to shoot wack rappers and get away with the crime
Like to bag shorties tried to fuck 'em two at a time
Like to see that bitch nigga who alarming the cops
Only reason I pull heat in front of his mom and pops
I never liked that, but if he want to front on me
I'ma strike back, niggas can never front on Bleek
I like to boast, foul niggas never snuck in my clique
Everybody that's related, we busting they shit
Any girl I want, believe Bleek fucking 'em quick
I like to watch the Knicks while chicks sucking my dick
No sweat, I like to do sets while watching the Nets
Go to parties take my shirt off when I'm rocking my vest
I like to come through and drink Bacardi Dark in the Lex
After that, smoke weed in the park when it's wet
I like to throw Henny up for all my niggas that died
All my street niggas who used to rock they Timbs untied
Sauce Money, Memphis Bleek, what we bound to do
Forever and a day we'd like to put this down for you, uhh

[Outro: Sauce Money]
I'm saying, that everybody like to do something ya know
Live and let live, you like what you like I like what I like
That's what we doing, what we like to do
Sauce Money, Memphis Bleek (Bleek Bleek...)
Marcy, son...
