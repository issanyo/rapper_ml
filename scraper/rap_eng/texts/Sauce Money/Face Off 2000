[Intro: Sauce Money & Jay-Z]
Suace Money, Jay-Z, Clark world
2000, and it goes like..
Uh huh, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Sauce Money]
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Lay my game flat, what you wan' do
Talk all night, are we gon' screw?
I'm talking 'bout me and you, and it goes like...

[Verse 1: Sauce Money]
I like to push up on chicks like it's the last record
Take 'em to the telly get buck passed naked
Let 'em feel the power, lick 'em if it don't taste sour
Hit 'em in the shower for an hour
Give 'em that feeling, Sauce Money for real and
Let her get on top if there's mirrors on the ceiling
Hit her so right that she wanna throw rice
My device makes her say "Damn, that nigga's nice!"
Know I got wifey lay my cards when I pivot
Pass your seven digits if you're with it
Sauce wanna give you the option for the boot knocking
Nine times outta ten it's on and popping
Ain't no stopping victory's in the air
Bring a friend next time let's do it again
Bring your whole crew if you see through me
And we can meet on the BQE
And it goes like

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Sauce Money]
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Lay my game flat, what you wan' do
Talk all night, are we gon' screw?
I'm talking 'bout me and you, and it goes like...
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Lay my game flat, what you wan' do
Talk all night, are we gon' screw?
I'm talking 'bout me and you, and it goes like...

[Verse 2: Sauce Money (Jay-Z)]
Had this bitch bragging
Sauce had his tongue between my thighs lally-gagging
Huh, could you imagine?
Shaking your tail just like a dragon here comes my worse flame
In the morning Hot 97 the first thing (deny it?)
Hell yeah y'all don't buy it
I don't eat no kind of fish if you can't fry it
But who knows maybe one day I'll try it
But for now slow down too much Lil' Kim in your diet

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Can I get it what - get it wet?
When he hit it first, can I get it next? Shit, you the best
It ain't wack to be with both of us, mami actually
I'm Eddie Kane Jr., that nigga me!
You want me to feel what he feel when it's tight
And I know, you don't be doing it right?
But it gets no liver than this, never lie on our dick
Shit, we got niggas rides on our wrists
Play your cards right you'll be driving the 6
Shopping all day, hopping out in the dist'
Popping the Crist', shit hopping outta your wrist
Popping your shit, New York's hottest bitch
From the ghetto to the stilettos
But you gotta do it two times like an echo, you feeling that?
(Feeling that?) This is how we run it down the line
Nigga Sauce goes first, Jigga next to rhyme

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Sauce Money]
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Lay my game flat, what you wan' do
Talk all night, are we gon' screw?
I'm talking 'bout me and you, and it goes like...
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Lay my game flat, what you wan' do
Talk all night, are we gon' screw?
I'm talking 'bout me and you, and it goes like...

[Verse 4: Sauce Money & Jay-Z & Both]
I see you got a lot to get off your chest
Coat, blouse, bra, don't talk me to death
Like murder's on your mind mami, off the dress
Jigga ran game 'til I lost my breath, uhh
Last thing I need to know is what it costs for sex
What you need to know is if I lost respect
Don't have to worry if you do Sauce correct
I'ma bless that, bring my whole crew through, don't even sweat that
Uh, dime pieces I'm hitting
Four in the morning, Frosted Flakes in your kitchen
Now you want me to start tricking I suppose
That's when the first Face Off kick in
"We don't love these hoes!"

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Sauce Money]
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Lay my game flat, what you wan' do
Talk all night, are we gon' screw?
I'm talking 'bout me and you, and it goes like...
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Lay my game flat, what you wan' do
Talk all night, are we gon' screw?
I'm talking 'bout me and you, and it goes like...
