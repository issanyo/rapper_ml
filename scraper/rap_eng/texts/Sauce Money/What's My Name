"Sauce Motherfucker" "Bitch niggas listen"
"I represent that shit, nigga bombs it son" (Repeat 4x)

"You niggas heard 'Pre-Game'"
By Sauce Motherfucker for you lame motherfuckers"

Ain't no stopping, cats just dropping
Hear guns cocking, fuck it, still rocking
Thug niggas and thug bitches give me my props and
Playa-hatin' motherfuckers cock-blocking
Cats got it twisted, I'm the next nigga
Sauce Motherf-ing, check your text, nigga
I fuck tracks raw dog when I sex this
A rebel, I'm on some Malcom X shit
Let the tec spit, I'm gunning 'em all
All these new niggas y'all pump, I'm running 'em all
Ain't nobidy fucking with the shit I do
If you disagree slightly, I shit on you, what
I'm just with it, tell from my riches
Keep my cars tinted, all my bitches
Love the bigga nigga cause I grind a lot
Try to calculate my figures cause I shine a lot
Keep my fingers on the trigger til I find a cop
You know my style, all my fucking lines be hot
I share these niggas, clear these niggas
It's my time, how dare these niggas

"Bitch niggas listen"

Niggas is sick, once I dig in your chick
Heard all them rumors, Sauce, getting rich is a bitch
Confidently I spit, my clique is the shit
The more weight I gain, the more bitches I get
How ironic, hooker made off like me
With no album out, came off like me
First single, watch it take off like beats
Squeeze the eight off like me, skate off like me
I know these cats ain't about they bids
I stay ready, I doubt these kids
Want it, or you work on it
You ride my dick so much I put a turnstile on it
Only fair now, pay your fares now
Spit snare rounds for spare clowns, no fear now
Rhyme or skit asshole, it's time to split
You just passing gas, nigga, I'm the shit
What's my motherfucking name? (Sauce Motherfucking)

I'm the defiant vet you cats try and wet
Wanna be Jordans, ain't even Kobe Bryants yet
Sauce Money ain't no half-ass rapper
Act fast rapper, stack cash rapper
Hood past the hoochies cute, stack lucci, duke
Rock three-quarter Gucci boots
Internal Revenue, that's money up the dookie shoot
(What?) High off of Hennessee shots
Enemies plot, but my memory got
Sixteen with one in the head, gunning with lead
Cats like to gossip? Here's something to spread:
Sauce Money coming, better get ready
Fuck you vets, I don't squeeze to touch your chest
My flamer got me aiming at your upper esch
Unstoppable, when I'm on a block with a heater
If you love me, wait to you hear little Jeeter
