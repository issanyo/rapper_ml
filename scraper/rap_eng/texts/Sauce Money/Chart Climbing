MC rhymin'
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
MC, MC, ARYC
Uhh, uh
MC rhymin', chart climbin' with the baguettes, Roley shinin'
We smokin' the best trees, I bet some skins on it
I got a SE, twenty inch rims on it
I got playaz who wanna kill me, blood is sweet
Because I got a freak, every day of the week
They just fake friends, they hope the shit ends
They see the dough my click spend in the big Benz
They think it's sweet, now we rock Cubans with diamonds in â€~em
But if they sleep, hell is where I'ma send â€~em
I know it's beef â€~cause I don't wanna be rhymin' with â€~em
They wanna act like bitches, time to split â€~em
What the deal Ma? Heard I was boss ha?
On the real, wanna hear it from the Sauce ha?
You like the way I do it? I just gotta spit
I got flow doughs hoes and a lot of hits

In the trial my niggas'll squeeze for the general
MP's holdin' my heat, nigga run wild
I dial, executioners, go the extra mile
Nigga cock that, lose a screw when it pop black
Never provoke toast, niggas get ghost most
You couldn't be my family, we never spoke close
You spit that "yo" shit, I say "nosotros"
Don't fuck with 'em dudes, think 'em niggas homos
I'm talkin' the bad bitches, you on some funny shit
You go for broke? I go for gettin' money, kid
I grab your homebase, now she give new honey head
To all you Donnie Brasco's, I'm Sonny Red
I split a weak nigga cheek quick, with one of those
Fuck a physique wrapped tighter than mummy clothes
Off looks alone probably get to touch â€~em all light
But because of the flow, now I fuck â€~em all night

You like dough, baby? Work hard, you can get that
But in the meantime, let me hit that
Get you down on all fours like a Kit-Kat
I'm tryin' to split that, shouldn'ta did that
In and out with the quickness
Now what could make the brother stop?
Nothin', well maybe if the rubber pop
And even then that might not slow me down
I'm 'bout to go to town, wanna come? Show me now
Singular most MC's bringin' the toast
I run roughshod rip rap stars and roast
I don't brag or boast, I only speak in facts
And if I say you seven days, how weak is that?
Fatal to niggas that's unable to ride wit me
You better decide who side or collide wit me
The very last rapper tragically he died swiftly
You been warned, motherfuckers now come and get me
