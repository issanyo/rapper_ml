You have practice today at 4
You got a flight at 6
And you have an appearance at 10 Shaq

Yo why do you keep missing those free throws?

(Shaquille O' Neal)
Can you hear that man?
I hear voices

(*Various voices*)

(Shaquille O' Neal)
Shaq diesel comin through doin his thing on tracks
Make hot joints bang on wax
Lay back talk style never lazy flow
Actin like you know crazy dough
Have to reincarnate me five times to blow
My power around here they know my style
When I'm through do is how you find your chips
I sign the slips all kind of whips
Quick to leave a fake scar squash I'm the finishing touch
Like armoire at the end of the car wash
Jams appeal larger than life size hands are real
Movies cause am a steel
Tell me how you plan to feel when these jams be dropped
And you try to star can't be stopped
You can croak this got a new rap style ferocious
Hopeless is what you are who be the dopest

(Chorus)
(Sauce Money)
I'm here to bring all you haters the news
Don't make excuses better mill fake play as you lose
Harder to hit the greater to bruise
Listen to my choices T.W.IsM. queues hear my voices
I'm here to bring all you haters the news
Don't make excuses better mill fake play as you lose
Harder to hit the greater to bruise
Listen to my choices T.W.IsM. queues hear my voices

(Sauce Money)
I got the call from my man three-hour time difference
Time to lay it down Sauce Money you with this?
No doubt I'm going to hell of a night
Shaq with T.W.IsM. Sauce Rockefeller for life
How these queues put it down kinda funny you know
Cash come with whistles now cause it's money to blow
My flow register under license hits
My man Reno hold straps with lights and clips
Finally wish you was as nice as this
Got a priceless gift people flow rap device is swift
Listen to my essay you can see
Easily I am M-O-N-E-Y when I say nobody move then I spray
When the smoke clear your whole crew'll be M-I-A
Then I'll be on the M-I-C to LA from the P.G. to NYC

(Chorus)
(Sauce Money)
I'm here to bring all you haters the news
Don't make excuses better mill fake play as you lose
Harder to hit the greater to bruise
Listen to my choices T.W.IsM. queues hear my voices
I'm here to bring all you haters the news
Don't make excuses better mill fake play as you lose
Harder to hit the greater to bruise
Listen to my choices T.W.IsM. queues hear my voices

(Shaquille O' Neal)
My thought rocks the real estate Shaq bought blocks
Sauce you know is real stack more knots

(Sauce Money)
My thought rocks from rap sure shots
Shaq you know the drill
My whole state of mind Fort Knox

(Shaquille O' Neal)
Ignore cops on the creep make you the villain
Just a non-violent..... who rap just to make a killin

(Sauce Money)
How was I thinkin?
Prisicking no sons like fried chicken and bustable guns and died lickin

(Shaquille O' Neal)
We collide quick when it's this phat
Shaq's like a dentist my job to fix plaques

(Sauce Money)
Sauce Money stage discreet cause everyday is beef
Who number one when you play the streets?

(Shaquille O' Neal)
Mesmerizing (uh) what you call my flow
(Never lose my focus baby it's all for dough)
Just a little somethin that you all should know
(Voices in my head got you fallin slow)

(Chorus)
(Sauce Money)
I'm here to bring all you haters the news
Don't make excuses better mill fake play as you lose
Harder to hit the greater to bruise
Listen to my choices T.W.IsM. queues hear my voices
I'm here to bring all you haters the news
Don't make excuses better mill fake play as you lose
Harder to hit the greater to bruise
Listen to my choices T.W.IsM. queues hear my voices
