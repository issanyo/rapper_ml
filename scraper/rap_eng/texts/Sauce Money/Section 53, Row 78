Hi Nanni, it's your granddaughter Riani
I love you and I miss you
Hi Nanni, this is your granddaughter Shadaria
Love you and I miss you, see when I get there
Hi Mom this is your daughter Teela
I love you and I miss you

God bless you

I hope the scribe finds ya soul, good Mom I love you
Miss you, and I know I speak for the whole hood
Ain't nothin' changed still shed tears
I can believe I've been mournin' your death
Goin' on close to six years

I think about that heavenly day
As I meditate in section fifty three row seventy eight
I'm obsessed to see you but I know it's a process
So until then miss, God bless

Seems just like yesterday when I saw ya hope
I made it crystal clear how I truly adore ya
I couldn't help it the other day I broke down
To my lawyer WGY, I tattooed my right arm for ya

He could understand all the time that was given
He couldn't understand the pain his mother's still livin'
He couldn't understand all the love that you gave to thee
Sacrifices that you made for me while I'm singin'

Mama, your love lives inside of us
And we'll be livin' inside your love
And I know you forever
Will be watchin' from heaven above

Some times it gets rough for us
Livin' without you here
But I know we'll together again
Livin' inside of your love, yeah, yeah

I remember all throughout the mall we used to walk about
The house down in Maryland that you used to talk about
One day I'ma make in mind my only object
To give you a better life and take you out of the project
Because you deserve better than pissy elevators
Stray shots from haters and roaches by the insinuators

Those nosy neighbors made you wanna run away
Main reason why I could never put my gun away
Still could see the pain as soon as you busted in crushed within
Found out your baby boy was hustlin'
I still quiver as the doctor delivered news that made me shiver
Said the cancer spread through ya liver

The next day I cried hopin' but I knew you was leavin'
When I saw you with your eyes open but wasn't breathin'
Could you imagine takin' your mother's hand
In a body that's colder than any winter ever known to man?

Mama your love lives inside of us
And we'll be livin' inside your love
And I know you forever
Will be watchin' from heaven above

Some times it gets rough for us
Livin' without you here
But I know we'll together again
Livin' inside of your love, yeah, yeah

I draw strength from her death, go to live for her breath
When I'm wrong drop to my knees and repent till I'm fresh
September Sixth music represent to my best
Stay focused and play the hesitant to the left

Conversations with God, now it's not quite the stress
Gave me the reassurance that my life was blessed
Because I've been in the tight spot
That's with enough pain for ten Annie's
That's why I write hot and win Grammies

Courageous enough to throw my chest to a block
Fortunate enough to throw a Lex to my pops
I got so much love I can rest on my block
Break day and fall asleep on the bench with my watch

Player hated eternally but I can't be stopped
God, Moms and me gotta reach the top
Conceal my staff, cowards wanna squeal, I laugh
You will never know how real till you feel my wrath
Feel my wrath, feel my wrath

Mama your love lives inside of us
And we'll be livin' inside your love
And I know you forever
Will be watchin' from heaven above

Some times it gets rough for us
Livin' without you here
But I know we'll together again
Livin' inside of your love, yeah, yeah

Mama your love lives inside of us
And we'll be livin' inside your love
And I know you forever
Will be watchin' from heaven above

Some times it gets rough for us
Livin' without you here
But I know we'll together again
Livin' inside of your love, yeah, yeah

Yo hold on, hold on, let's take a minute to reflect
On the whole thing you know I'm goin' on six years
With out my moms and that's a livin' hell
You know that's a part of ya life that you'll never get back

You know when she died, a part of me died
You know that's a pain that nobody needs to go through
Yo we all gotta do it but while she's still here
Appreciate your mother and love your mother, ya heard me
I need y'all to feel me on this one, yo I'm out, one love
