[Hook: Sheek Louch & Styles P]
I'm a G on these streets, the hammer gon' blow
The hood fuckin' with us, but what else you need to know?
I was gonna pull over, she was tellin' me to go
I ain't even wanna fuck her, but what else you need to know?
If my niggas lookin' for you, ain't nowhere that you can go
Got shooters in every hood, what else you need to know?
Houses, cars, weed, a lot of dough
LOX, nigga, but what else you need to know?

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Puff played me "The Benjamins," I thought it was wack
Wrote a verse, next day I brought New York back
I was cool with that LOX shit, no solo plans
That's why every song you heard was just my mans
I missed J-Lo, "John Blaze," a whole lot of dough
I'm from Whitney Young projects, what else you need to know?
Moms died from cancer, I felt like stoppin'
Still a couple of rap niggas that I feel like poppin’
Wasted a lot of money on the shit that I bought
Back then me and 50 would've gone near fought
How they still spittin' fire, it's killin' them slow
'Cause we loyal and y'all not, what else you need to know?

If my niggas lookin' for you, ain't nowhere that you can go
Got shooters in every hood, what else you need to know?
Houses, cars, weed, a lot of dough
LOX, nigga, but what else you need to know?

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Went and got kilos with that Bad Boy advance
Me and 'Zino was cool, but I stabbed some of his mans
Trick Trick homies almost cleaned my clock
Them Detroit niggas crazy, but I love that Ahk
Yeah, I came from the ghetto, so I like shit rough
So I sorta spazzed out and threw that chair at Puff
We had beef with the Roc, I was ridin' with the strap
Hov, Sigel, and Free could have all got clapped
But they was doin' the same ‘cause shit was like that
But these new niggas soft, they don't even fight back
But now I sell juice, but I used to sell blow
Shot niggas, stabbed niggas, but what else you need to know?

If my niggas lookin' for you, ain't nowhere that you can go
Got shooters in every hood, what else you need to know?
Houses, cars, weed, a lot of dough
LOX, nigga, but what else you need to know?

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Before takin' rap serious I had that work
Wrote a few songs for Diddy, yeah, I got jerked
Just a young kid thinkin' that life ain't fair
But I was mad cool with Biggie, so I ain't care
We was still sellin' blow, we ain't like Champagne
After that we did the 'Let the LOX go' campaign
That coulda went the wrong way, that woulda made that bad
Ruff Ryders, Jimmy Iovine paid that tab
Freestyles all the Clue tapes, we had that lock
Still hard for us to shine, X had that slot
Yeah, nigga, the streets love us, we still gettin' dough
Five kids, three baby mothers, what else you need to know?
