Verse 1

Styles P

Yo, we do nuthin', we are nuthin' (true)
I ain't pullin' my blade if I won't scar nuthin'
I ain't pullin' my gun if I won't shoot shit, that's useless (why would I do that)
I'll kill ya whole family, that's ruthless (you pussy nigga)
You could die nigga
I ain't droppin a tear, I ain't thinkin twice nigga, you ain't my nigga
(you ain't my nigga)
I don't smoke with you, drink with you, eat with you (uh uh)
I got a problem with you, I'mma let the heat whistle
This is real shit, nigga I peel shit (tell em')
I'm harder than concrete and steel mixed (who's better)
I wanna kill niggas (kill em)
You think it's part of the verse, it's part of the curse, and I don't really
Feel niggas (I don't feel y'all)
They say stop the viloence, but I gotta join in it (I'm gonna join in it)
I'm in the hooptie with 3 Ki's a boy in it
This is pay day, fuck what they say (fuck em')
D Block, grab your handguns and A-K's

Chorus 2x:

Bang that shit off, clap that kid up
Stomp that kid out, don't let him get up
Any block frontin', gon' wet that shit up

Whoever ain't feelin' this song could suck my dick
Garbage bag around your brother head, smother him out
To make sure he don't survive, nigga, I'm snubbin him out (bitch!)
Make you drink a bottle of Chlorox, hit you with four shots
They can't determine the cause of your death in your autops'
You scared? Don't come outside, the streets is serious (stay home)
My ribs touchin, I'm starvin', trigger happy, and furious
We could do it whenever, wherever, nigga set a date (what up!)
Remember to ask the doc if he could replace your face (bitch!)
