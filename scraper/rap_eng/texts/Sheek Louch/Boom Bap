[Intro: Sheek Louch]
Hmm .. L-O-X, D-Block
(D-BLOCK!!!)
New York put it on the map (yeah)
Strip club she put it on my lap
Popping bottles and hookah they forgot about that...

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
{"Boom bap, original rap.." --> KRS One}
Getting money, fresh, still loving that...
{"Boom bap, original rap.." --> KRS One}

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Ah man, ayo KRS, we got it from here big bro..
I pull up on your block, music up
CL Smooth and Pete Rock on niggas, Funk DOC on niggas
I ain't taking you back, still holding the MAC
Getting money, really give a fuck how you rap
I'm just here to represent that NY
Represent Y.O
And make the homie proud from Bed Stuy (BAY-BAY!)
BDP, standing at the window with your AK
Fighting the power like Chuck D, ha
(YEAH BOY!) We got in on smash
You got a little single, but how long it's gon' last (over!)
Every old shooter with me throwing that mask and.. (clip up!)
CLAP!! CLAP!! Let's take it back to that (woo!!!)

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
{"Boom bap, original rap.." --> KRS One}
Getting money, fresh, still loving that...
{"Boom bap, original rap.." --> KRS One}
Woo!!!

[Verse 2: Styles P]
One man eat, we all eat
Disciple of Rakim, descendant of Kool G (yeah)
It's way in the therm but I carry the Uzi (haha)
Now I just reign supreme, you're dummy you'll see
I put the city on red alert
Shout to Uncle Red Alert
A thousand homies that's a red alert
You ain't getting money on your block, get better work
I'll be repping that boom bap (D-Block)
Talking that dope money, all of my goons strapped
Smack you out your skinny jeans; yeah we're doing that
With the soft ass bars, all you cowards'll ruin rap

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
{"Boom bap, original rap.." --> KRS One}
Getting money, fresh, still loving that...
{"Boom bap, original rap.." --> KRS One}

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
HA-HAAAEEH! Uhh, yeah
Yo, I come through, splash your wig
I'm Kane mixed with Slick Rick, splash of B.I.G
I'm young Nas when he was just a Nasty kid
Nigga, I'm Kool V still getting cash with Biz
I was Lord Finesse, then I was Lord Tariq
Move 'em out the trunk, get it off the street
Got my DJ with me, he got his two Technics (uh huh)
Soon as he plug in, tell the crew let's eat (let's eat)
Put the kids away, Showbiz and A (salute)
Then pursue my dream, I'm Guru and Preme
The memories are vivid, you know I love the pictures
And yeah I love the strippers
But most importantly I love the, what...

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
{"Boom bap, original rap.." --> KRS One}
Getting money, fresh, still loving that...
{"Boom bap, original rap.." --> KRS One}
Getting money, fresh, still loving that...

[Outro: Sheek Louch]
L-O-X... (L-O-X, L-O-X, L-O-X --> screwed)
