[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
I'll take you to that island, oh
You know how my style is, oh
I put you on them diamonds, yeah
Real gangstas move in silence, shush
We don't say a word, we just meet up
Still good with them birds if you need us
I'm hoping that the homie never leave us
Let's just close the agreement

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Better agree to something or die for nothing
Cause them guns is out, and the boys ain't fronting
Rollie, chain, you gon' give up something
Them stick up kids, them niggas is hunting
You know what it is, you know I'm thug
Yeah I've been drinking, you know I'm drugged (no doubt)
You niggas with me? You know they bugged
Throwing money up in this club
First you liked when I was on that shit
Then you fell in love with this dick
And you text like I make you sick
Bitch you forgot I can take my pick
Bitch you forgot that you not my chick
I'm famous baby, you don't know my clique
Island hopping, we Vica popping
We smoking weed, them tops is dropping (D-Block)
You love that boy, you love that cash
I love those jeans, I love that ass (come here baby)
But my feet gon' stay in the cement, getting bent
Getting money, if you with me have to come to an agreement

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
If you want that A1, you gon' need us
Cause I got more stripes than Adidas
Cause I was in the hood holding heaters
And, I was seeing birds before the Tweeters
And the plug called up, he had to meet us
If you love real niggas then you gon' need us (L-O-X)
But I be OT, and I'm sipping margaritas
Tell your girl jerk us off, only way to beat us
If they ask me, they should've killed you as a fetus
Your girl's on an island and we got her sucking penis
Then she swallow semen, I put you on the cement
That was the agreement, you know [?] I'm agreeing

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Good sweatsuit, pair Air Force
Don't forget your ID for the airport (nah)
First time in first class, throw your shades on
Sip a mimosa, play some Marvin Gaye songs (let's get it on)
A gentleman, that's how the status came
When you land take the train straight to baggage claim
Temperature change, you feel the flame on it
A driver's waiting with a sign with your name on it
Get ready for a long night
Get to the villa, shower, throw on something all white
Yeah, we gon' blow each others' minds
We gon' sip some more wine as long as we both sign...

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
...The agreement
I'll take you to that island, oh
You know how my style is, oh
I put you on them diamonds, yeah
Real gangstas move in silence, shush
We don't say a word, we just meet up
Still good with them birds if you need us
I'm hoping that the homie never leave us
Let's just close the agreement
