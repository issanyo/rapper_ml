[Intro]
Yo, what's up, bro?
What's up, brother?b
Chillin'
I Got the package, you got it?b
You know I do
That ain't even the nigga, bro
It's your problem now, catch it
Shiiit

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh huh
First I brought the bricks in, then I brought the pounds up
These niggas is still mad 'cause I tore the town up
With the three-five-sevens and the four pounders
And it's sad 'cause they just wanna be around us
Yeah, 'cause they respect the brother
I'm in the new Audi, R8, reflect the color, grey with metallic
Kush with the haze make it solid, put it in a dutch or chalice
My team is the foulest, lay you on the floor like a pallet
And crush your skull with a mallet
Never do it sloppy, spent everything, went popular
Ride for my niggas 'cause at the end I know they got me

[Verse 2: Snyp Life]
First I hit it with a needle
Then I cut the dope into bundles like the dust that I stashed in the freezer
Broke niggas move they shit cheaper 'cause it's weaker
But Snyp shit raw like he spit it to a feature
Shit get deeper like [?] with a Visa
With a fresh new heater in a Lex', two-seater, uhh
Life's a bitch so it's death when you meet her
But I leave 'em stretched out from the bars through the speakers
Poke your chest out 'cause it's hard when you meet us
It's D-Block, treat us like the mob when you greet us
Old school like ADIDAS, this shell-top split through
Niggas know the model, four pipes and a pistol

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Ivan Drago hangin' out the Murci√©lago
Yeah, police lookin' like the God is Pablo
Diamonds on my wrist, hand on the fifth
I'm Old School, nigga, like the pick with the fist
I'm so cold, it's hot, the curse and the gift
Louie duffel flyin' outta J-F-K
I feel like Pusha T how I be with the yay
Million dollar brain, billion dollar lane
I'm buyin' up the house before a million dollar chain
I save Cash Money like I'm tryna be Wayne
Don Don, pain killers and the dutch
Yak and a bitch, nigga, don't want much
