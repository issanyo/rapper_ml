Gunny, Hey yo Jay wharrup fan, ya? D block, hey you ready, if you ready go in or what?*
Yeah, I clip up the nigga, Johnny, can I get any higher, they say sheep's on fire
I feel like death jam, just sound starter mayer
I've been a g since I was chewin on a pacifier
I keep that nick cannon with me, no Mariah
They say the hood is mine, it's like the nigga was born against the wind
She... Johhny Frankenstein, my auto-mo is pretty as camorra Amy

Guess who win the kitchen? Guess who moving [?]
Public information these are proving facts
They're fine with the oj's and down bottom somewhere hot, but no breeze
And dinner with young millionaires, this is o keys, just sit back
Talk shit and blow trees
My outfit's un-wearable, my shoes don't fit you
My pain's unbearable but niggers didn't listen to my shit
Ain't hearing ya, I've been that nigga dog, you always been terrible
That's why the label ain't clear the day you decided to come through
Cop back...
