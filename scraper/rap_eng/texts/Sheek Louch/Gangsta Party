[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I just want to be somebody
Keep nothing but G’s around me
Every night’s a gangsta party
Every night’s a gangsta party
Gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Every night’s a gangsta party

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Disappear then I pop out in Atlanta nigga
Throwing money, you can put that on your camera nigga
G shit, only gangsters understand it nigga
25 to life, they trying to hand a nigga
Green sweats with a nice red stripe, Gucci
Black burner with a nice red light, Louchi
Mom made, the hood raised me, my pops skipped
I bagged my little grams 'til I got a whip
Laces was untied and I ain't even trip
I ain't that greedy, just make it flip
Nothing but positive thoughts
Getting money and my niggas walking out of these courts
Gangsta party

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I just want to be somebody
Keep nothing but G’s around me
Every night’s a gangsta party
Every night’s a gangsta party
Gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Every night’s a gangsta party

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I’m a little more than affiliated
I own the ring they kiss
Yeah you see my clique and your gangster seems assimilated
But I can’t knock the hustle, I won’t block the hustle
The crib just got renovated
You supposed to follow an innovator
Hammer burn you like the incinerator
Crew fresh play in the elevator
Press the PH button
Headed to the gangsta party, think we ain’t stunting
'Bout to blow half a pound like weed ain’t  nothing
If we there, so is the money and we ain’t fronting, gangstas

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I just want to be somebody
Keep nothing but G’s around me
Every night’s a gangsta party
Every night’s a gangsta party
Gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Every night’s a gangsta party

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
My presence is enough then what’s up then
Honeys just as foreign as the cars we pulled up in
Cognac, champagne bottles just erupting
We’re never reluctant to throw on the Tom Ford tuxes
Bowties, pocket squares, hard bottoms
They never go'n be able to touch him, Allah's got 'em
We celebrating life, just getting to know the new cats
Money in the air, what’s tension? we don’t do that
Not here, no weak links, just tough links
And I got a couple of karats in each cuff link
From slinging hard to partying with the stars
Can’t nothing come between this thing of ours, that’s gangsta

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I just want to be somebody
Keep nothing but G’s around me
Every night’s a gangsta party
Every night’s a gangsta party
Gangsta party, gangsta party, gangsta party
Every night’s a gangsta party
