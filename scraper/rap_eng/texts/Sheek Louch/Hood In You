Know you from the streets, know you got the heat
Wanna let you know, you got what I need
You know, I like the hood in you
You know, I like the hood in you
Know you from the streets, know you got the heat
Wanna let you know, you got what I need
You know, I like the hood in you
You know, I like the hood in you

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
I love the way you come in here looking
Your face is all pretty, but your kind of thugged out
So I can tell that you from Brooklyn
I hate to sound corny but is this seat tookin
Them other brothers scared, but the God ain't shookin'
I'm Donnie, a third of the greatest (LOX)
You can try, but it's so hard to hate us
I drink a little, no I'm a liar
Them sparkles be coming to my table, like the club on fire
This loud in my dutchie, got the whole club higher
I can have any woman that I desire
Do your thing girl, you got a man? I don't care
Give me a call when that nigga ain't there(Woo!)

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
I was so high, I almost mistook her (word)
Try to act like she's some but she's a hood booger
It don't matter, you know I'm from the hood
So that pussy all good, either way, hah, that's my nucca
Don-Don, shades on, Angry Birds on my phone
Flight delay is smelling like weed cologne
Chill, papi, searching me for what?
Your security sloppy
I made it through with an ounce of that Broccoli.(Haha)
Nice body, I tell her flaunt it
Throw some Gucci on, and make them thirsty niggas want it
I can't get enough of this chick
She can't g-get, get enough of this dick

[Hook]
Know you from the streets, know you got the heat

Know you from the streets, know you got the heat

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
See the moral of the story
Without the hard work there's no glory
We be on CNN like N.O.R.E
And I know you hate to date the rapper
At least I don't put my hands on you
But you can go back to the slapper
I try to get you rose cause I respect you as an actor
But you always bring up the X-Factor
I'm a G, see I don't need a better woman
I need a better woman, to better me

You know, I like the hood in you
You know, I like the hood in you
