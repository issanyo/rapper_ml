[Chorus: Ragz Da Artist]
I don't need no friends (need no friends)
Give a fuck about opinions (give a fuck about opinions)
Gotta chase you a bag (chase you a bag)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (fuck up out your feelings)
Four wheelin' in a V, skirt, skirt, with a thick bitch blowin' trees works
Family over everything
Fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)
I don't need no friends (need no friends)
Give a fuck about opinions (give a fuck about opinions)
Gotta chase you a bag (chase you a bag)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (fuck up out your feelings)
Four wheelin' in a V, skirt, skirt, with a thick bitch blowin' trees works
Family over everything
Fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Crazy
Hey yo
Talk about everybody but can't take shit
I blame Instagram for all the fake shit
Drop knowledge in your quotes like you intelligent and shit
But the pictures you take is half naked
Made up this fantasy land but can't escape it
So when the clown nigga fuck you, he gon' tape it
Got a fat bitch feelin' she gotta stay fit
So she can keep this jail nigga to play with

[Verse 2: Ragz Da Artist]
My old bitch and my new bitch, I was stressin' 'bout some old shit
Now my new bitch and my old bitch
Guess she tryna' be a nigga new bitch
Started from an eighth to a whole ten
Back flip, run it up
Got it movin' like a track meet, fuck is up
Better bundle up
Ice drippy
Mink sets
Gold bottles
Matched necks
Hoes swallow
Racks flex
Nike box
Mad checks
Never shook a nigga's hand, didn't mean it
Got a couples niggas off, now the team lit

[Chorus: Ragz Da Artist]
I don't need no friends (need no friends)
Give a fuck about opinions (give a fuck about opinions)
Gotta chase you a bag (chase you a bag)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (fuck up out your feelings)
Four wheelin' in a V, skirt, skirt, with a thick bitch blowin' trees works
Family over everything
Fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Real talk
Yo
I come in to say what's up like my answers get a cup
Stall my music and stay outta niggas' way
I get money, stack it up
When I talk, I back it up
That's why I'm high 'til this motha fuckin' day
Stay the fuck up out your feelings 'fore I pop and put your blood up on the ceilin'
Yeah he a shooter but that mother fucker squealin'
And they know it but these niggas still chillin'
And drug dealin' like that won't get you arrested
This fake shit, how the fuck you digest it?
Full clip, I stay bulletproof vested
Where Donnie at? You gon' have to MapQuest it
Fuck that, I don't need no new friends

[Chorus: Ragz Da Artist]
I don't need no friends (need no friends)
Give a fuck about opinions (give a fuck about opinions)
Gotta chase you a bag (chase you a bag)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (fuck up out your feelings)
Four wheelin' in a V, skirt, skirt, with a thick bitch blowin' trees works
Family over everything
Fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)
I don't need no friends (need no friends)
Give a fuck about opinions (give a fuck about opinions)
Gotta chase you a bag (chase you a bag)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (fuck up out your feelings)
Four wheelin' in a V, skirt, skirt, with a thick bitch blowin' trees works
Family over everything
Fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)
Stay the fuck up out your feelings (stay the fuck up out your feelings)
