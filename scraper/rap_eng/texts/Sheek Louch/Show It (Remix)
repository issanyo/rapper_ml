[Verse One: Sheek Louch]
Rose by the one hand, other hand rolled up
Nice True Religions on, three buttoned Polo'd up
Club's packed all the ladies happy that I showed up
It's thug love, but tonight all my dogs hold up
Dutch burnin shorty got the club in a coma
Starin at me I can tell that mami like the aroma
Fifty thousand on my neck like I ain't got a diploma
But I'm smart enough to know what I want so don't front
Come here girl!!!!

[Verse Two: Demarco]
Shorty go!!! (HEY!!!) She already got her mind made up and she ready to roll
Tip top shape thick thighs with a small waist
She's independent, she can buy her own things but I'm tryin to take her home
Gotta make her my wifey, OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

[Verse Four: Sheek Louch]
For maybe you, I bust a little baby you
In the middle of the street while I'm carryin heat
A chance to meet, sandals I'm lovin your feet
BPM me, you can pick the place to eat
Sexy summer Louis bag the color of flowers
Hair and makeup look like it took a couple of hours
Now we sittin in that four door Panorama
Body's crazy I gotta put that ass on camera

[Bridge: Demarco] (*Sheek Louch)
(BABY YOU!!!!) I can tell you a star
(BABY YOU!!!!) I can see you shinnin from a far
