[Intro: Sheek Louch]
L-O-X
Damn baby make your mind up for-real
You going to love me or leave me alone?

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
When we first met you knew that I was still in the streets
Our first time at the movies I was carrying heat
First you didn't mind that I liked to smoke, drink alot of liquor
Made a living off of bagging up coke
Hit that Louie store get two of whatever you want
Cop that speedy and that Louie monogram in the front
Then I got famous, signed with Puff
You was happy but still hated my tours and stuff
Every bitch that I took a picture with, conspicuous
Text message you ain't shit, and who is this
It was all love back in the days, until I blew up
But you don't understand my ways

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Ayo Kiss I got a girl that's bad
But she don't understand my ways
Arguing days after days after days
Well I could dig it
Ayo Styles I got a girl that's bad
But she don't understand my ways
Arguing days after days after days
Well I could dig it

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Mellow off the la la, leaving is not an option
Cool like Melo and La La when we be rockin'
Shit get bad we like Stevie J and Joseline
Starring at the dolphins, playing some Jannis Joplin
Hotel balcony, OT arguing
She ain't budging nigga and I ain't bargaining
I'm so high I forgot why we was arguing
I'm just trying to make up
Make love and fuck, fuck and make love
Then I'm chilling on the tub, weed bud to break up
Love is so much I ain't trying to break up
Sometimes she be tripping the minute I wake up

[Chorus: Styles P]
Ayo Sheek I got a girl that's bad
But she don't understand my ways
Arguing days after days after days
Well I could dig it
Ayo Kiss I got a girl that's bad
But she don't understand my ways
Arguing days after days after days
Well I could dig it

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Sometimes the easiest way is just to let go
Sex after the argument is usually the best though
Brining up shit I did in the past, that's stressful
It's all good though, as long as them checks flow
You know what they say when you search you find something
That groupie shit is old school, Nine something?
Sit down, have a convo, mind fuck them
Pack my bags, spend the rest of my time puffing
I could take the bruises, not the accusing
The tactics you using, becoming amusing
Screaming and shouting, frowning and pouting
It ain't that hard, just love me or be out then

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Ayo Styles I got a girl that's bad
But she don't understand my ways
Arguing days after days after days
Well I could dig it
Ayo Sheek I got a girl that's bad
But she don't understand my ways
Arguing days after days after days
Well I could dig it
