[Verse 1]
Beg and borrow for your life God
Kissing they ass you hoeing for your life God
Money got low you bout to sell your ice God
Music industry treading water
Was on top now you barely can feed your daughter
Law and order album sales out the rectum
So next time what they offer you is disrespectful
Even though you hotter than the past summers
It's too bad all the labels see is big numbers
Wifi vision on the game yo In the hood
They got vision on your chain bro Is she on your dick still
Or is she ducking your calls with Taequan in the mall
Laughing at your instagram pic getting high sucking his dick
In his whip playing your shit reality is brutal
You ain’t saved a dime cuz u ain’t used your noodle
You back in the hood now
I could find you and I ain’t have to Google

[Hook]
Is you legendary first class of secondary
Is you executive level or are you secretary
Is the hating on them young boys necessary
If you a G let it be that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that
If you a G let it be that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that God

[Hook 2]
It’s like you fresh out the penitentiary
Everything changed bottles ain’t complimentary
Where them songs on the radio at
Why them DJ’s ain’t calling you back
He was a mixtape how he got it like that
Now you mad at the younger Gods the new talent emerge
You feel it’s nothing that they put in their words
But so what Is Jordan mad at Kobe Is Kobe mad at Bron
That’s life you pass the baton but read the Quran, embrace it and bond
Take em to a level you on and then you’ll be considered a don
But this ain’t about me this a song about the OG bredrins
Thats considered as legends

[Hook]
Is you legendary first class of secondary
Is you executive level or are you secretary
Is the hating on them young boys necessary
If you a G let it be that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that
If you a G let it be that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that God
