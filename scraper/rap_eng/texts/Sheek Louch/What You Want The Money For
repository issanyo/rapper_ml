[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]

Still money in that Louie duffel
Range Rovers and foreign cars, I had a couple
Always beefing on the block, my niggas have to scuffle
Then them guns came (Oh!) and Lloyd in trouble
Shoot at me, I clap back
Nigga all I do is trap
I catch a pretty, I go give that bitch a dirt nap
Then I got them bottles pop
Every time I'm in the spot
Nah I don't pillow talk
You can suck my dick or not
I'm feeling like a ghetto boy
Scarface, Willie D, I'm a ghetto boy
Yankee hat, white t, in my meadow boy
Whip it, microwave it, let it settle, boy
The bodies where niggas fishin'
They say that I'm on a mission
You see that them diamonds glistenin'
Thank God I'm in a good position to kill you
I asked around, they said the hood they don't feel you
Start fresh

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
Two fifty riding on the dash
A whole bunch of money in the stash
Everybody want to get this cash
Everybody want to get smashed

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Tell me what you really want the money for
Tell me what you really want the money for
Tell me what you really want the money for
What you gone do when you got it (when you got it, got it)

[Verse 2: Swizz Beatz]
I'm on 995 with a bundle in the stash
Shorty next to me got a bundle for an ass
My i8 looking great, night I ate
Glock 9 on me, God damn, don't hate
These niggas really talking about
(What they want the money for)
Sheek Louch, Swizz Beatz
(Get the, get the money for)
Man, the Empire State
Top floor penthouse, boy eating great
Some sushi and some lobster for the homie's hoes
Niggas came back, can't hold me though
The double 0 boys through your block though
We running through your block, we ain't ?

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
Two fifty riding on the dash
A whole bunch of money in the stash
Everybody want to get this cash
Everybody want to get smashed

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Tell me what you really want the money for
Tell me what you really want the money for
Tell me what you really want the money for
What you gone do when you got it (when you got it, got it)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
I gotta grind from the bottom till I make it the top
Soon as I walk in the club, the bottles coming non-stop
You know the diamonds is bright
And these haters can't stand it
We're gone keep on balling
Until we say, "God dammit!"
Tell me what you really want the money for
If you sue me, all my goons gone be at your door
In your block, niggas know that we get busy
Sheek Louch rocking with my nigga Swizzy

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
Two fifty riding on the dash
A whole bunch of money in the stash
Everybody want to get this cash
Everybody want to get smashed

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Tell me what you really want the money for
Tell me what you really want the money for
Tell me what you really want the money for
What you gone do when you got it (when you got it, got it)
