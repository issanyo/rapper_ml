[Intro]
I mean yea, some nigga’s just want that murder shit
Point blank

[Hook]
You ain’t seein’ my face, or what’s on my waist
I just woke up on em and bang em
All you gonna see is fire, then you gon’ hear the tires
Imma lay his ass out as soon as you name him
How you do it
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go

[Verse 1]
You can hear them things drummin it's like the phone bill
You don’t pay it so all them bullets is all incoming
Trust me ock, my little niggas wet up the block
Cook on the stove, sell yay like they Hov
Law and order, body out in Bora Bora
Two shots take the door off your Ford Explorer
Hollow heads, stash house, futon bed, smokin’ kush to the head
I’m strong as a bear and I ain’t talkin’ bout Ted
Pull a mask down then I’m upside your head
Ungodly thoughts, settle things right in the street
This Nigga, I don’t go to court

[Hook]
You ain’t seeing my face or what’s on my waist
I just woke up on em and bang em
All you gonna see is fire then you gon hear the tires
Imma lay his ass out as soon as you name him
How you do it
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go
Hold it straight. Now let the hammer go

[Outro]
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
Now let the hammer go
