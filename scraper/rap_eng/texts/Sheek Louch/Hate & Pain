[Intro: Sheek Louch]
What's up kids?
What's goin' on man, what yall doin'?
[?]
Can yall do a favor, can yall do a favor for Uncle Louch huh?
You can?
I need yall to sing the hook for me one time, real fast. Ok?

[Hook: kids]
Take away all the hate and the pain (x4)

[Sheek Louch]
Ayo, Fuck it let them hate
I walk around with this heavy ass revolver but
Today I feel featherweight
If you ain't thinkin' bout going all out
And running down south, homie close your mouth
They don't want to fight
They just talking all night
Let them hate, i know i'm doing something right
And I'ma continue to blow up
Make niggas throw up, until you little niggas grow up
Yeah, I got just what you're lookin' for
The pump will leave a nigga dead at the liquor store
Yeah, you get sprayed on the kitchen floor, tied to the oven door
Dog what the bitchin' for?
Shit, it gotta be somethin' else to do
Get off my dick and find you a bitch to screw
Homie, somethin' gotta give
Before I come into the place where you live and...
