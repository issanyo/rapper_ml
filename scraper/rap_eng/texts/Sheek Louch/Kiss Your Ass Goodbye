[Intro]
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
Ohh, shit, let's go

[Chorus 2x - Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbye
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
La da da, da da da
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block

[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo, this that shit that make niggas wanna rep they clique
Grab their gun an' diss niggas to their dick
Buck somethin', go somewhere an' fuck somethin'
Like that frontin' nigga bitch, make her suck somethin'
Wild out, D-Block shirt inside out
Hoodie on with the all black Belushis on
Niggas yappin' 'til they muh'fuckin' face is torn
Tongue is gone, three-piece suits is worn
Hit y'all fagot ass niggas that's scared to death
Talk shit, when I'm around, y'all hold y'all breath
I make murder music, my shit bang in the city
But they want me to chill since Janet showed titty
It's too much violence now since Ja ruined 50
I don't know no other way but to rap gritty
Fuck that, baby, when I'm rich
Until then where the fuck is my thugs at up in this bitch? (Let's go)

[Chorus 2x - Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbye
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
La da da, da da da
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block

[Styles P]
Whaddup, nigga? You cut up, nigga
Shoot shit to lift the truck up, nigga
D-Block, D-Block howl like a wolf
Tell your mom I throw a child off the roof
Give a basshead a hundred dollars to towel off the Coupe
Style on niggas; beat somethin' down
We gon' pile on niggas, wild on niggas
(La da da, da da da)
That's a lullaby for you
Better ask your man, he ready to die for you
We comin' through, tearin' the block up
We ain't gettin' locked up, that mean we even shootin' the cops up
Whaddup? Yeah nigga, two mo' times
Whaddup, whaddup? Now we in the New York grind
Better kiss that ass goodbye, when I'm passin' by
With plastic nine to blast your eye, right, (what)

[Chorus 2x - Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbye
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
La da da, da da da
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block

[Sheek Louch]
Ayo, I talk shit how I wanna talk, bop how I wanna walk
An' you can tell that nigga dere is from New York
An' I still got my South niggas ready to squeeze
I don't need cake to see me with a couple of G's
An' I don't need a loan, muh'fucker, I'm grown
Had a thirty eight before I had a phone
I stuck niggas up before y'all lil' niggas started to bone
This that Sheek Louch shit, y'all niggas tryin' to clone
Let's be real, the average muh'fucker with a deal
Probably never had a fight, no guns, none of that
Niggas know I'm right, I say goodnight to my son
Give my baby moms a lil' cake
An' my moms a lil' somethin' 'fore I go on the run
Before pussy niggas try their hand
I'll kick in the door like, "Daddy's home"
An' I ain't 'Making The Band'
What y'all coward niggas don't understand? (Yeah)

[Chorus 2x - Sheek Louch]
