[Verse 1]
Started making green when I was sixteen
Grown man shit cause daddy was a coke fiend
Me and my mama struggling through the drama
Bagging up crack I remember my first Llama
Nickel plate nine I remember my first grind
Clapped at a nigga he dropped
I ran up on him grabbed the bag
And met with nigga's down the block
Face no expression I'm filled with all this aggression
Young on the roof I'm cloud testing the Wesson
Then it came time when a kid [?]
Ma tried to get me to the mosque for a lesson
I was thinking [?]
To acquire all that it take a couple of bucks
And I ain't have the money to move a couple of ducks
So I put the mask on and robbed a couple of fucks
(You know that this is)
It's like God sent music to me
He sent it to my mama through the speakers
Then he spoke through Aretha
Curtis May playing
I'm trying to imitate what they saying
Mom told me go to my room
No microphone performing everything with a broom
I was meant to be a star
I was born to pop bottles drive cars
And smoke everything in this cigar
Me and my nigga's is so thorough
We heard about Mary J. Blige but never heard of the borough
We celebrate life like it's new years
We make notes pop like they root beers
We lost nigga's we call those crew tears
You in my dreams but those nightmares
Ruger thoughts, no Kruger thoughts
Now a nigga ball like Jordan shorts
