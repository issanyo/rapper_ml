[Intro]
Ayo [?], what up, God?
Ayo, check this out, right
I don't even want to yell and shit, man
Throw in something
I just want to clear my head
It's like that
I got 'em
Gonny
Let's go

[Verse]
They listen and love it, these little niggas ask for a verse
I'm out of your budget, my nigga, so fuck it
How it go, "mo money, mo murder, mo homicide"
When I was young, I got the keys to my momma ride
Burner under the seat, so when I stop short, the gun slide
Police next to us, got us looking all petrified
They ain't even want us, wasn't even looking
Later, I laughed about it like "I wasn't even shooken"
Didn't even have beef then, but still had the burner down in Arlington
At the [?] key for the weekend
Nigga get the drinking, then nigga get the blasting
I love that fast money, boy, the rapping was the last thing
I knew we had a gift though, high school, bang on the lunch table
And let my partner kill 'em with the Kiss flow
Been fly from the get go, I thought it was dope
I sold the fiend soap and brought me a Canal Street rope
I had the pele pele, avirexes, [?], and bear coat
Lil shorty in the projects, all she like to do is deep throat
Spit it in the sink and come and ask me for a c-note
Her friend tried to fuck me, her man tried to fight me
I shot at that nigga, feds tried to indict me
I was this close to telling my real niggas got to write me
Instead, I write this song, salute to the dead
I got some yak and some sour, I'm just clearing my head
Nigga, we let the smoke burn like we Dali Lamas
Homie, we hit the club hard, D-Block, we fuck up some commas
Nigga don't want drama 'cause all I see is bread
It's like a bitch sucking my dick, I'm clearing my head

[Outro]
D-Block
Sheek Louch
Kiss, what up, nigga?
SP The Ghost
LOX
LOX nigga
Sliverback Gorilla coming soon
Ayo [?]
Let the monkeys out
