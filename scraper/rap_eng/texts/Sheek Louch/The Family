[Verse 1: Styles P]
Yeah, it's the Wraith, and I chalk the great safes
On a 911 turbo with a place to vacate
I'm putting on my own soul, I'm the illest nigga to live
Since BIG, my nigga, I got faith
Me, Kiss, and Louch, my nigga, that's living proof
If you never saw poison look at us in the booth
When it comes to the streets you know we the illest group
Trinity, fly sector, rap scientists that'll dissect ya
Who wanna get shot like a trifecta?
I could say who get shot like a director
Executive producer, used to move powder on the streets
Now I move powder in the juicer
Come to a lyrical es√©, just call me jefe
Me and my bitch spending 30 racks in Jeffrey
On the 14th, I do it like Rothstein and Santora
Got money in the box like pandoras

[Hook: Styles P]
You could make it or spend it, you could spend it or make it
You could take it or give it, you could give it or take it
All my niggas loyal so all my niggas is sacred
It's all about the family, put it over the paper
You could make it or spend it, you could spend it or make it
You could take it or give it, you could give it or take it
All my niggas loyal so all my niggas is sacred
It's all about the family, put it over the paper

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Years in this rap game, still no Grammy
Y'all use the word loosely when y'all say the word "family"
Family might argue, but family don't show it
Never on social media, not a bitch won't know it
Family'll go hard when it's raining or sunny
Family'll do shit for you and not for your money
Family'll load the Ruger and put something in your head
Family's the only people by your hospital bed
Family could move away and not see you in some years
Something happen to you, cry the same amount of tears
I met a few niggas that's more family than family
I ain't expect an aunt or cousin who would understand me
Blood thicker than water? I heard that before
Till you put the car in your name and fuck up the credit score
That's why we can look alike, but I don't give a damn
Be careful when you use the word "fam",  fam

[Hook: Styles P]
You could make it or spend it, you could spend it or make it
You could take it or give it, you could give it or take it
All my niggas loyal so all my niggas is sacred
It's all about the family, put it over the paper
You could make it or spend it, you could spend it or make it
You could take it or give it, you could give it or take it
All my niggas loyal so all my niggas is sacred
It's all about the family, put it over the paper

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
You gotta overstand me, nothing over the family
But sometimes it could go all wrong, Gotti and Sammy
Sat with each other and cried right over Nani
Now you got the bandanna tied over the swami
He ain't even ready to die, he just wanna jam me
He hope they catch me with the ratchet and remand me
Hm, I could kill him, instead I just keep my distance
And listen to the best 3-men group in existence
The money came later, we did it being consistent
Cause money didn't matter, it wasn't bigger than friendship
They couldn't get in our ear separately and convince us
That's why there haven't been nothing like us since us
You can't move me, the energy is all through me
The sensei of the slick talk, yours truly
I'm tight with my umi, in the jails they love me
Just like some flicks or money order, a kite or a loonie, cuz

[Hook: Styles P]
You could make it or spend it, you could spend it or make it
You could take it or give it, you could give it or take it
All my niggas loyal so all my niggas is sacred
It's all about the family, put it over the paper
You could make it or spend it, you could spend it or make it
You could take it or give it, you could give it or take it
All my niggas loyal so all my niggas is sacred
It's all about the family, put it over the paper
