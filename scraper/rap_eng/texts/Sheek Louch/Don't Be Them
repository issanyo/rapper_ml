[Sheek Louch]
Yeah, don't be them
Don't be Jigga, don't be Nas, don't be Kim
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't be BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid
Don't be Sheek, don't be LOX
Don't be P, don't be Kiss, don't be Fox'
Don't be 50, don't be Weezy, don't be Slim
Be yourself for real homie, don't be them

Aiyyo, now I ain't gon' sit here and preach to y'all niggas
Like I'm all fucked up and I ain't seeing no figures
But if I had the choice to tell niggas who to be
I'm just keeping it thorough, shit it won't be me
All you see is the fake shit that's on TV
You don't be in the hood when niggas empty three
Court cases, no laces, orange dickies
Jewish lawyer helping you but he cost Gs
Drunk, tryna figure how the hell I'm getting home
Cause ain't nobody left in this, just me and my chrome
D-W-Y'd, I already been tried
So I know the jake watching to see if I abide

Yeah, don't be Swizz, don't be Tim'
Don't be N.O.R.E., don't be Cam, don't be Jim
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't be BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid
Don't be Wade, don't be Moss
Don't be Pun, don't be Crack, don't be Ross
Don't be them, don't be Common, don't be Em
Be yourself for real homie, don't be them

Aiyyo, now everybody got things that going on in their life
From their fake ass friends to their fake ass wife
Money problems, bills due
Niggas scared to turn on the news cause all you hear is who killed who
So you see us at the shows and think that we straight
Niggas tired, I don't remember the last time we ate
Just drinking, smoking, jumping on planes
Trying to be careful of what chick give me brains
There's AIDS out there, and blades out there
Niggas trying to cut you like fades out there
Everything pretty behind the scene
Until you find out your favorite rapper's a fiend

Yeah, don't be Luda', don't be Tip
Don't be 'Face, don't be Usher, don't be Flip
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid
Don't be Sharpton, don't be Jesse
Don't be Kan', don't be Melo, don't be 'Bron
Don't be them, don't be Bush, please not him
But for real little homie, don't be them

Aiyyo, this ain't to down little rappers and crews
I'm just tryna tell niggas that we stressed out too
If you sick, we get sick nigga, flu is flu
You don't know, I don't know nigga, who is who?
Niggas think we just entertainers, and big complainers
You don't know how much shit a day bring us
I'm just saying, ain't no guarantees
Next single you drop just might freeze
You be hot for a minute then you cool on down
Look at rap for years, niggas been passing the crown
I'm just do you homie, don't be him
Don't be me either, fuck that, but don't be them

Yeah, don't be them
Don't be Jigga, don't be Nas, don't be Kim
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't be BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid
Don't be Sheek, don't be LOX
Don't be P, don't be Kiss, don't be Fox'
Don't be 50, don't be Weezy, don't be Slim
Be yourself for real homie, don't be them
Yeah, don't be Swizz, don't be Tim'
Don't be N.O.R.E., don't be Cam, don't be Jim
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't be BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid
