[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. & Lil' Kim]
UNDEAS
Lil' Ceasar
Queen B, that's me

[Verse 1: Lil' Cease]
Yo I be buyin' 'em V's, so all my girls be eyein' Cease
Comin backstage, dyin' to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin' with bunch of foxy women
Why you speedball with cards? That's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin' there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

[Verse 2: Lil' Cease]
While you tryin' to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude
Or we tastin' like food when we get in the mood
Listen girlfriend we don't mean to be rude
But anything I touch come straight to the rear
I take chickenheads like the Playmate Of The Year
Cause when I first met her, she had the Lex and the 'tegra
Game real good, sex was even better
I got it for the cheddar once I hit it in the sack
Cause I'm Cease a.k.a. Long Dick from the back

[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you

[Verse 3: Lil' Cease]
Yo shorty won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be right here just chillin' witcha people
You know Junior M.A.F.I.A. was just a preview
I know I had you open, so why I'ma leave you
Especially when I know yo' man is fee-ble
It's Cease Degenaro, you know how we do
My game is tight, we do the same every night
I'm smooth as the words that come from Frank White
You messin' with city kings with glissy rings
That's gonna show you good time pretty thing
'Cause you was spotted, in the club lookin' exotic
By somebody, short, dark and chocolate
You got it? Any plans to tape yo we stop it
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah we all about a profit
I'm the right dude to get you in the nice mood
Flossin rocks the size of ice cubes

[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
