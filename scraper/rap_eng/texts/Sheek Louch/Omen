[Intro]
The omen

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Should I let it ride or make a nigga die
Let him see his kids or let his soul fly
In the project lobby I ain't feeling Godly
Put some coke on the floor make it like a robbery
Manslaughters for my thoughts alone need holy water
Scenes from law & order
I'm just saying I got to get it, that money my niggas with it
My killers will get aquitted with masks on
Hope you got a couple dollars you can pass on
You know them D-Block boys getting they blast on
I can pull up DOLO and you know it's a omen
Middle of the street and get it on like a Roman
Pray for me

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Pray for me (let us pray)
When I die what will the angels say for me
Send me to hell probably give a K to me
To kill the devil they know I got a way with me
What you know is first is evil is evil I need to
I'm dirty like a dopehead needle
But one eighty negatives repetitive
Crack your chest and your cranium nigga wicked like Damien
The Omen, wolf omen
More like a lycan, all my niggas is triflin
Pop a cop; nigga fuck an indictment
Ill, I can reach to the sky and grab lightning

[Interlude]
Bow our heads
Let us pray

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I'm a king from the underground
A lot of bad things happen when I come around
Yeah six six six is my number now
Scary part of it is I ain't gotta gun em down, nah
Insane mind set the Bible and the flag on fire at the same time
Main arteries when it's game time
Satan's offspring, yeah I claim mine
Crazy how I could think about it and will it
Look at something and kill it, bloodshed is the illest
Corpse that you ran through, cross on the mantle
Sit Indian style in a circle of candles
