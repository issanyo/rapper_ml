Straight off the block
Terminology!
Sheek Louch!
Lil Fame!
M.O.P
LOX official street shit
Yo Termanology you ready?
Get out these niggers man

[Verse 1:Termanology]
I’m raising traps with amazing raps
Facials black, black magic
Lace you black magic disappear fade the black
Satan’s back, I’m a human incinerator
I b urn you like Frank Lucas did that tin tiller
I then spell out the vision of 10 Hitlers
Can’t kid us immersive ten killers
The pot filler order key boiling
Economy is weak so the robbery is more for
A lot of people is better so…
Cause they be on the corner with the metal and the poison
Snap! Crack a pot you got
Homey no 2 part
I use grind to move pops
Got a killer boombox
Moved up a few slots
Then it’s all independent
Fresh kicks new slots
You was writing about that ghetto living in the boom slots
I was on another level biting new watch
Safer in safe…end of the flocks
I just wanna call her my name like new flock
Kill you for the kicks come forwards shoe box

Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Straight off the block I’m straight off the block

[Verse 2:Sheek Louch]
Straight off the block
Yeah I block these pretty bitches
Still on my cock
LOD block no X still got it all on
Termanology and shit
Sheek Louch you know what’s going on…
Pop this cocaine roll-o
Your pill on my photo
Police want my photo
Skinny jeans sins homo
Got a team of dollar she’s think Donny was Romo
And I’ve seen more a promo
Yeah coming straight off the block
Jumping on the freeway like I’m signed to the rock
38 special I feel special in the core
We nice bout ourself but we special in the group
Turnt on the hoop I’m a Duncan and a hosed
There’s no need to lie when you fucking with the truth

Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Straight off the block I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Straight off the block I’m straight off the block

[Verse 3:Lil'Fame]
It’s the truth yo
I take paper like that
Circle in and the jazz got back
You know them all big boy do it together
Skinny popping through the hood like I ain’t never left
Fuck y’all yeah I’m misguided
The 3rd to the base stab her to the AM
I’m still down and dump the cannon on you faggots
Slick roll through your skin like maggots
Niggers respect my …
Except I’m black I rap dough shit
Tell her ferocious…
So act cautious I’m mad too mad
From nigga to killers murder mass Boston
Hit’em hit’em hit’em and send them in the coffin
I though we rock son turn off the block son

Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
Straight off the block I’m straight off the block
Nigga London, Japan and I’m straight off the block
