[Sheek Louch]
Yo, if it ain't G's you stuff in my pocket, nigga stop it
That bullshit you talking go rehearse that and rock it
Fuck round I pay dues, that nigga with the tattoos
That been hard since motherfuckers watching Little Rascals
So when I say I bust my shit, could believe it all the way
In the summer time with shorts and [?]
You could walk still, every block in Yonkers be hot still
With minors that'll bust you down faster than the cops will
Niggas sellin vests to steppin youths, falsely accused
That been shot and you can still see the chest bruise
I die for my 3-5-4 niggas, with the young stoned niggas
LOX are my hardcore niggas
Sheek give it to you like a bitch with a disease
That got AIDS on her lips so when she talk it bleeds
So if you want it, bust it, and it better not be flares
Or you gon rot like a dead [?] under the stairs

[Black Rob]
Yo, I send that ass through the E-R, now I'm out in P-R
Heard in New York, y'all was looking for the [?]
Faggots sweatin' us, we are four of the baddest
I'm the one that's gon stick you for all your cabbage
The icon, doing this since [?]
Perpitrating ass niggas like you, I keep my eye on
I rake em, roll em, like smoke from Peter Ross
Then I [?] em, [?] em, work hard to be the boss
My faction is Kumb-a-i on some attackin'
Dudes frontin acting like they tough as Tinactin
Spittin', them bullshit crimes I stay hittin'
Not forgetting, them bullshit crimes and ass whippings
The whole 9, I dont waste time, I brace mines from the waistline
Niggas is scared to face mine
See I'm a criminal, so after this interview
I'ma bend a few, fuck it, could be ten of you!
I put the end to you, I promise to God
It's about time y'all niggas paid homage to Rob

[Styles P]
You can catch me on the low with a calendar bitch
I got blow and she's baggin the shit
Comin' thru in a '98 wagon, lavender shit
Imagine the shit, mystery like Agatha Christ(i)
Cop in the truck the SP cockin' to dump
You can find me with my enemy coppin' his lunch
When I'm finished niggas ask which block do I want
My pockets is lumped, find me on a yacht with a blunt
What you know about dime bitches cockin the pump
Watchin a Don, I learned how to market heron (heroin)
I'm invaluable, celebrate stuck off the Malibu
Science is the game and it's all mathematical
Pearl white Porsche, licence plates "RADICAL"
You real when the Federales in Cali get mad at you
Forget that, Lox on the block want they shit back
And I was in the first place, feeling the hit backs

[Jadakiss]
Niggas act like Jada won't grab the 3-8-O
With the potato and clap at niggas in broad day though
You know the flow, where it come from and where it go
And where it's gonna be at, that's where we at
I touch you [If You Think I'm Jiggy] was a Puff move
And still sellin' forty-thousand a week, so fuck you
Three niggas you dont want none of
Make your insides feel like the summer
You gettin' dumber and dumber
While we gettin smarter and smarter
Makin' shit harder and harder
Cook this rap game like the Carter
I'm Nino, Styles is Rothstein from Casino
And Sheek is the boss of the Hennessy Gambinos
We talking millions, you talking C-notes
Used to stash dope in our ski coats, couldn't play it sweet though
You know the Kiss, on the low in the mix
Blowin' dro sipping Red Ally and Moe with a bitch
When my niggas'll flip, we'll see how cute you look
In the box with the suit on like you used to look
Hard body with a purple faced future look
Future crook, the same nigga who boots I took
Guliani ain't no motherfuckin' joke
He got mad niggas broke lot of niggas gettin bad coke
When they bring it to the lab if it's totally slab
First felony, you still gettin' four and a half
