[Intro]
Set it off, set it off, set it off, set it
Set it off, set it off, set it off

[Jay aka Jadakiss]
I'm saying "What!" to niggas that act like wreck
When I flash the Tec and hit a nigga in his neck
With two slugs, blood is a sign of vic
And if his bitch wanna snitch she can bite the dick
That's my word, anything goes for the hoes
I'm snatching rings, earrings, jewels and clothes
From the ghetto, trying to get my hands on a ki
So fuck Mike cause niggas wanna be like me
They think I'm crazy, nigga, like a bag of dust
I don't listen to the fuss cause I'm trying to bust
With the motherfucking BM drop, 325
By the way, me and my crew, we real live
Get absurd and hit a nigga with the bloody birds
Niggas can't fuck around with the bloody words

[Sheik aka Sheek Louch]
A-yo, I buck shots at midnight like I'm a fucking crook
Do stick-ups, head North, get the cash and book
I make ends but it depends on the type of vic
If it's a dealer the Tec-9 will kill him quick
Who's to say if I won't, money, and if I will?
I let it rip and up close and watch your temple spill
Mad blood everywhere but who says I did it?
Bullets they caught but in my gun, it wouldn't have fitted
Cause I'm blasting with the cannon every fucking hour
.22s don't work, I need a double power
Watch your back for The Warlocks, hit the street
And stay low for the stray bullets past your meat
Mad young but I don't give a hoot
So I just pollute and kicking heads with my fucking boot
So put your dicks up, money, or head North
Or head for the border before my squad decide to set it off

[Hook]
Set it off, yo, set it off (Repeat 4X)

[MC Lotto]
I know you niggas don't want drama cause I'mma tear that ass out the frame
I was born insane and surrounded by the drug game
And ain't a damn thing changed, I still chill
With the Glock on the block trying to make a mill
Niggas is done for fun, so don't test, son
I find a victim and stick him and move to the next one
Serial killer, but I ain't after Captain Crunch
I murdered the Brady Bunch cause I'm out to lunch
Lost my brain in the drug game, I love to do the wrong thing
I make g's from selling ki's of cocaine
No judge can judge me, police can't touch me
Watch out, shit's about to get ugly
I got the Tec, so respect the Main Source
MC Lotto, yeah, I came to set it off

[Sha-Queen aka Ma Barker]
Yo, watch the evil spirit rise when niggas get me fed
I slash a bitch and leave her weave up in the bloodshed
A heartless bitch with a switch giving bitches stitches
I got a backyard that's full of fucking dead snitches
And plus this chick is flowing slick it's coming from the mental
No shame in my game, I'm aiming for your fucking temple
And plus I'm coming equipped with the mad styles
The niggas I kill will go down with chalk profiles
Yeah, you bloody roughneck, my style's damn good
The shit I kick is taking motherfuckers manhood
So all that shit you plan on talking yo, you won't be able
So watch your mouth before you catch a fist that rocks your cradle
And now you know my state of mind that I'm letting off
And any time that I rhyme I'm gonna set it off

[Hook]

[Mikey D]
Yo back the fuck up, before I catch a body
I'm giving niggas boxes
And that's including motherfucking hotties
So get your pistols and your posse if you think you can stop me
I open 'em up like a autopsy
I got a crew of niggas waiting for the combat
If we can't get you we stepping where your mom's at
So all that rah-rah shit gotta cease, I pop my leash
If it's beef you ain't leaving in one piece
I drink a forty and I take over 40 Blocks
Niggas with Glocks give me props, they say, "Shorty rocks"
From 40 Projects to 40 acres and a mule
Knock out a 40, then I'm knocking out 40 fools
If they ever try to get with the nitwit, forget this
The hitlist and crippling the witness
I gotta get it off, when I let it off
Straight up and down, motherfuckers, I set it off

[Hook x2]
