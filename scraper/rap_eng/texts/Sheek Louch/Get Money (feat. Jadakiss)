(Jada) It's the dance step, it's the BOUNCE!
(S.L.) Gotta make sure I don't spill my drink on this
(Jada) Ha ha ha ha! It's the swagger
G's up homey

(Chorus: Jadakiss)
I'ma get money, get money
I don't care if your peoples act funny
I'ma go loco, straight loco
Aiyyo mamis pass the trey-ocho
Cause we do it, straight do it
You coulda came with us ma but you blew it
Make it hot boo, bring your friend too
And drop it like you supposed to, ah-HA!

(Sheek Louch)
You know what this is lil' momma
You could walk around with the top of a pajama
Boxers on, pillow case over the llama
Drama; I deal with more weed than a farmer
Point blank, dot dot, period, comma
(Yeah) So gritty, but still so pretty
Broke and I get as much pussy as Diddy
Ante up, catty all candied up
I'm on ice like I just won the Stanley Cup
Yup! Stay booted up, a little 'gnac in the cup
About to score, the homey had to shoot it up
(Yeah) 23's, low pros on top of a flatbed
(Ha ha) Niggas think I just got towed - nope!
To the car show, Murci√©lago
Hammer in the cargo - what's my name? (Sheek Louch!)
Sheek Louch that boy there 'bout to change the game

(Chorus)
(Sheek Louch)
Aiyyo; I ain't gon' lie, it's a lot of things I can't buy
But if I really want it bad (yeah) and really get mad (yeah)
I'ma grab the strap like a muh'fuckin dad
To get what I want, if it take me a month
And pitch my lil' pieces right in the front
Smoke my blunt, and drink my 'gnac
And watch my back like I'm under attack (woo!)
A lot of people think I don't like their ass
Guess what? (Guess what?) I really don't like their ass
And won't hesitate to put somethin in you fast (let's go)
So you can go 'head with that bullcrap
Cause I don't mean rhymes when I say I ain't afraid of a murder rap

(Chorus)
(Sheek Louch)
Aiyyo - she said she love my flow, and the things that I say
And how the rest of my crew is so caliente
You D-Block boys really know how to play (D-Block!)
When the next LOX album, I'm just waitin for the day
Look Range, Bent' Coupe, house, indoor hoop
Chain got enough karats to put in grandma soup
I ain't in the loop, I'm nowhere near you
I'm in the hood dawg where them peoples scare you

(Chorus)
