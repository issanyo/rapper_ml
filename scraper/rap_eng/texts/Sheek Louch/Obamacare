[Intro]
And you say New York City

[Verse 1]
Giving out money like a charity
Fuck diamonds loyalty got more clarity even though I’m icy fly with it
Valet parking a peach Birkin bag holding my Larking
Is it me ah they wondering is he a lock
The way I’m dressed Louie sneakers don’t belong on the block
Peace ock Rolex written on the face of my clock
Pretty bitches always sitting on the face of my cock
Playing madden on a baby iMax smoking drinking liquor nigga tryna relax
Money come and go but life got one shot
So live yours nigga stop bitching what you ain’t got

[Hook]
From hard work and suffering
From hustling and struggling
From coming up from nothing
I made it into something
Being young in the projects trying to make progress couldn’t find my way out
Couple bullets with no names on it got my homies laid out

[Verse 2]
Yo face frowned up but not cus I’m ice grilling
Spilling tequila shots white linen party on yachts
I was young though nappy head nose with the snots
Kinda smart always knew how to connect the dots
Not saying that my shit don’t stink I just been through a lot
So I don’t give a fuck what you think Conan destroyer looking in the gym
See a bunch of bottles on the table yeah God it’s definitely them
Forty five in the car I don’t mean to be troublesome
You think I’m chewing bubblegum but look it’s the gym star
I made money bought a house had kids made her my wife
I’m definitely living my life

[Hook]
From hard work and suffering
From hustling and struggling
From coming up from nothing
I made it into something
Being young in the projects trying to make progress couldn’t find my way out
Couple bullets with no names on it got my homies laid out

Suffering struggling
