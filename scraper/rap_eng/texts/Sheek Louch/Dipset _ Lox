[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Ayy, let the beat drop, Dipset, D-Block

Kush got me higher than a treetop
Your girl put my dick in her mouth and did the beatbox (Ah)
Get her hot, teapot
Pockets lookin' like they got speed knots
Naughty sweats, Reeboks
Fur draggin' like a Ewok
Race back to back, look like Star Wars when we speed bop
West side to East side, we ride (Ride)
No top, gettin' dome, gettin' blown while I breeze by
Watch look like I'm tryna freeze time
Drippin' water like I deep-sea dive
Jeans cost a stack, they ain't Levi's
Screamin' when we see cops
A-B-C-D-E-F you, out the G ride

They call me David, I wave it like it's a flag, it's a mag in it
And yeah, I'm squeezin' off everyone (Squeezin')
I'm playin' Dip while I dip in the whip (Skrrt)
To the set where you slip in the clip
They in check, are they gettin' you hit? (Check)

How you from Harlem, don't know who Huddy is? (Huddy)
And when we got richer than Rich and them
So much money that the Feds wanted to picture them
Shit, you know Rollies with a dab of ranch (See that)
Woulda run up on me if you had the chance (Wish you would)
Uh, new condo, four rooms in it (Check my stats)
Copped the Bentley truck, there's more room in it
So I could pull up to the club with more goons in it
Shit, the Wraith got the stars, I need the moon in it

[Break: Sheek Louch]
Shit, you come to New York, you know what it is, nigga
Dipset, D-Block, bitch

[Verse 6: Sheek Louch]
Ayo, I'm on some other shit
Fuck me too, smack your mother shit
Clap off, want the same years that my brother get (Facts)
Royalty, never broke up, shit is loyalty
Contracts, big deals, the money never spoiled me
Black nine, black fatigue, lyrically a different league
Been high since limelight tunnel, Mr. Seein' Speed
D-Block, hood love, gun underneath your chin
Holes in your Make America Great hat again
