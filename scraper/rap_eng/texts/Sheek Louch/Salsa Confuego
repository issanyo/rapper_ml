[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Be easy, I'm too greasy, you too cute
I will shoot through that suit, through them vapes (?), through those drapes
At night, well alright, we fuckin'
Who him? He's nothin'
Y'all got kids? They straight
He want you back? Too late
I'm hood but I'm grown
You can stay broke on your own
Got houses, no loans
Vacation spots, no phones
Just my guns and my ones
PS4, the Xbox is my son's

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Just some weed and some brown
I was broke as a kid but right now nigga I'm ballin'
Keep it goin' Daisy (?)
I'm ballin'
Wooooo

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
I had bapes, I backed up
I was hot in the streets, I racked up
We met Puff, I plaqued up
I got famous like, "bitch back up!"
I'm too cold, check the pulse
Ask about me, any beat, never froze
My niggas major, look at the shows
All that bitch talk, where your hoes?
You say you fresh, where ya clothes?
I heard you trappin' and rattin', who knows?
I stay far, I don't get close
When I see you, just 'what's up,' that's the most
Bad energy, you can keep it
And that money you want to borrow? That's our secret

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Just some weed and some brown
I was broke as a kid but right now, nigga, I'm ballin' (nigga I'm ballin')
