[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
It's the world's greatest (Ruff Ryders)
Make you throw your bike's up
Make you rep your hood, now scream
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Murda Mook]
I think I'm getting why these motherfuckers hate me
Cause I've been putting pressure on everything lately
And I'm here pressure bust pipes kinda easy
With that being said I apologize to BP
But to the rest of y'all it's no courtesy
I'm not a nest so won't none of y'all burden me
Next generation of the double R lights up
I'm the next nigga that's gon' make 'em throw they bikes up
I literally had millions watching me
On stage turning dudes to a mockery
Yeah they copy me with no cash
These niggas is chickens in beef
Steady talking bout they go ham
You confused, you meat lover
I got Swizz feeling like Dre when he made Deep Cover
I'm the next Double R meal ticket
Made like a deck of cards nigga, deal with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drag On]
My flow dope like the methadone clinic
Pull on the Phantom when you see a don in it
Glove box you might see the Quran in it
Underneath the firearm, am I wrong with it?
I drop the roof to be captured by the sun
Relay my bars and remastered every one
Nigga's wondering where the fuck Drag at
I'm on Twitter hitting everybody back
Drag to the dash, I ain't back to claim shit
I still got the same crown I first came with
If I had to do it all again, I wouldn't change shit
Now I'ma shine when the rain get thick nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
All the pretty girls go round the outside
Porsche or the Range Rover, meet me in the ride
Windows all jet black you ain't gotta hide
Donnie, Razor Ramone, Bobby Backlund
This my throne cranberry silver patron, they love me
Hat back like I'm 15 face clean
Nice blue jeans sitting on the Louie
I used to run base and I don't mean ???
A long way from Dr Jays and Conways
I still like hoodrats, some Beyonces
Pop off you ain't ever seen AK's
Top down, Eddie Levert and the O'Jays
Donnie killing that UFO
It took a little while but Donnie gon' blow
Hater's seen Sheek nope, Donnie on the go
Might as well call me butter cause Donnie on a roll

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Ayo, personally I think I'm underrated if nothing else
Ask around, they'll tell you Jada is something else
Motherfuck who they know
It's the kid with the diesel bars and […] flow
It's a couple dudes I ain't got rid of yet
But it ain't no rush, niggas is butt like the back of the cigarette
Holla when it's time for the blood to get spilled
I only negotiate for thugs to get killed
Hustler, artist, CEO
On the low blowing strawberry Kiwi dro
Sling cane til they cut off my hands, other than that
I'ma spit pain til they cut off my glands
Got work all over the stove, getting money all over the globe
In the Range all over the road
Cribs and the whips is lavish
Double R mob life, Kiss a savage

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Styles P]
You know me, playing 'Kiss and Ne-Yo with your bitch
Or she can call time, run a trio on your bitch
Shoot 'em in the mouth, bet you he ain't gonna snitch
Fucking with 3 bad niggas
Telling your girlfriend to tea bag niggas
She's wavy, we crazy
ADHD, know where the weight be
On the scale with the guns off safety
Eyes hazy, money, mansion, Mercedes
Surrounded by killers, OG's, crack babies
Loading up the nine, dope stay a dime
Two blunts in the Watson 749
Red wine avocado, salad with the lamb and
Cilantro head honcho, rocking a poncho
Way out in Mexico
10 for the bird let you place the decimal
Turn your ass vegetable

[Hook]

[Verse 6: DMX]
You the next nigga, well, I'm the X nigga
Name still ringing bells so fuck the rest nigga
I do this shit for real, y'all niggas is acting
I'm old school like Andre the giant and Bob Backlund
Cats ain't never been able to ever
Fuck with the dog, whatever the weather
I come through, niggas bow down like Muslims praying
I'm just trying to understand what these fools are saying
Don't make me, somebody better take me outta here
This is what it came down to, fuck outta here
Cats gotta fear a nigga like me
I come through in beast mode from New York to AZ
Bitch you fucking crazy, thinking Dog ain't got it
Dog gon' hit it, as soon as soon as dog spot it
I'ma scratch to the death, till there's half of 'em left
I'm the last of 'em left, till the last of my breath

[Hook]
