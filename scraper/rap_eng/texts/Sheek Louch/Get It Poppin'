{Verse 1}
[BANG!]
You know me as the motherfuckin' "Love me"
I could back like rugby
I could see the game is gettin' ugly
I want that she out of it
I'ma make you proud of it
She here to separate the real from the counterfeit
Look at how I got 'em up
DJ! Put my record back! [PUT BACK!]
Know you's an autotune because I'm not to used to that
Spit wit' the steady flow
Years I had steady though
Whether it came from rap or fuckin' wit' the petty ho'
Blaze that, I could leave a space wit' your face at
Now just want a pussy, ma?
I ain't try to chase that
Done being incredible
All yellers had a ball
Fuckin' up the game practice - you panicking!

{Hook - 2x}
Motherfucka we run shit, run quick!
Go get your gun, quick!
We get it poppin' ova here!
Y'ain't poppin' ova there!
My niggas get it poppin' right here!

{Verse 2}
Let's Go!
Back in the street again, beat again
Niggas on my minigun
Pose bitches want me to beat again
Nigga want to clear the V-I-P out
Niggas know what we 'bout
Piss out before I pull the peace out
Now what?
Hit 'em here know we got his face cut
Nigga think he swayin' till we licking and we taste blood
I fuck the club up, we live to rug up
Patrol and five or ten hoes just to rub up!
Whip southside, ... boy, [It's me, baby!]
Bitches surround my car
Cameras out, I'm so superstar! [That's me, baby!]
/?Keep?/ it close to me
Who you supposed to be?
It's a reverb for blues, /?say ho it's donna we G?/

{Hook - 2x}

{Verse 3}
Somebody pull them shakers out
See what they /?think?/ about
Hey, crack, make a nigga go and get the paper out!
He know, hope you wanna flow when they hit blow
My niggas aiming at the crowd, at innocent people
D-Block, niggas wit' an attitude in pack, [Yes, Us!]
White tea, money green, M.I.B. jet black [No doubt!]
Kush got me feelin' light-headed
Two things we don't do - money & bitches - we don't sweat it!
[Keep that kush!]
I told y'all to motherfuckin' man to be back here, [Sheek Louch!]
It's your time to re-up on songs from last year
Now I'm back smoothin' in your grandma cashmere
If this ain't my year, I ain't pre-pare
WHAT UP?
