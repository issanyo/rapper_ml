[Hook]
I heard you from the projects but that doesn't even matter though
That ass make a nigga sweat and I ain’t even mad at you
All your girls as bad as you throw a couple bands if they clap like you
Clap clap like you clap clap like you
Throw a couple bands if they clap like you

[Verse 1]
I love a hood rat chick a project chick
Getting money any race a ass that’s thick
I love em working stay at home bottle service girl
I love them stripping work the pole and rock my world
But I don’t trust em however u making it I don’t judge em
I could fuck with you long time but I ain’t gonna love em
I don’t care where you from ghetto or not
I’m just saying that you hot if I got a shot to make it clap clap
I see you loving my rap I don’t care about your ex cuz I got my strap
Couple bands a couple bottles I’m here with my crew
I ain’t tryna hold u up baby go do what u do

[Hook]
I heard you from the projects but that doesn't even matter though
That ass make a nigga sweat and I ain’t even mad at you
All your girls as bad as you throw a couple bands if they clap like you
Clap clap like you clap clap like you
Throw a couple bands if they clap like you

[Verse 2]
Brown bag for the verse bought the Chanel purse
But now I’m hot and all this touring is making it worse
I remember them days I had to wait for the first
Getting money watch my back or be in a hearse
But now I pull on the block and only thing that I rock
Is vs clearer the chain hang down to my cock
So I know how it go when they call you a hoe
But you a virgin to me if I ain’t hit it before
So what’s good lil mamma I ain’t here for the drama
Imma spend the night and see it wiggle in your pajamas
Don Don Lou Albano rubber bands on both hands
Being broke ain’t in the plans let's go dyce

[Hook]
I heard you from the projects but that doesn't even matter though
That ass make a nigga swag and I ain’t even mad atchu
No other girls as fly as you throw a couple bands if they clap like you
Clap clap like you clap clap like you
Clap clap like you clap clap like you
Clap clap like you clap clap like you
Clap clap like you clap clap like you Throw a couple bands
Clap and I ain’t even mad atchu
Clap and I ain’t even mad atchu
Clap and I ain’t even mad atchu
Clap and I ain’t even mad atchu
Clap and I ain’t even mad atchu
