Bridge:
Whoa, whoa, whoa   (repeat 2 times)

Chorus:
Can't get you off my mind
Thinking about you all the time   (repeat 2 times)

1st verse:
The day we met was the last day
That I said I would look anyone else's way
Now you know that I'm with you
And I'll always be true
There's nothing in this world that I won't do for you

Chorus

2nd verse:
The day you left
It was so sad
Now I'm standing here holding on to the past
Keep growing on
Gotta live your life
If we grow up in time
Maybe real love we will find

Chorus

Bridge   (repeat 4 times)

[Styles P]
You need rocks on the fourth finger of your left hand
Tell your bridemaids to hit off my best man
Always on my mind like money
You my honey
There when I'm laced
There when I'm bummy

[Sheek]
Say word
It's type hard for me to get you off...my mind
But I still get dough, of course
True love between a thug and a dove
Poppin' champagne in the tub
What

[Jadakiss]
Ayo
Everything revolves around trust
Cause if it wasn't for you
Then there wouldn't be no us
No jealousy, envy, and no lust
328 off the lot when I bust
Sittin' in the house counting Lincolns
And I'm still thinkin'
Can't get you off, so I'm blinkin'
Sinkin' down in the silk couch, milked out
Your hole in my heart got my love all spilt out
