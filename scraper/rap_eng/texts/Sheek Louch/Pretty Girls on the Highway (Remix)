A bunch of pretty girls on the highway

(Hook: PURE)
A bunch of pretty girls on the highway
Seems like they all headed my way
Ride you through my city, let me show you round
I'ma be the one that will hold you down (2x)
A bunch of pretty girls on the highway (2x)

(Sheek Louch)
I stay flyin' in an Aston Martin rap p
Knock'em PURE i'm pretty sure thats what the game need
Different places pretty faces smokin' weed
Tryna ball'er when I'm all in her i'm too greed
A bunch of pretty girls on the highway
Detour D-Block bring'em where the thugs play
Where them things spray
Where we get a lot of money and police tryna jump out of the highway
This is how a dutch roll liquor in my cup
Chanel on the table I told shawty loosen up
This a family affair and my goons right here
So you can let your hair down and put it in the air

(PURE)
Said I'm looking for one girl, one girl, one
4, 5, 6, really feeling in touch
Oh I, oh I, oh I don't give a f*** about the rules
'Cause they know we gon' break them
It's not a pretty feeling in this
Every day's a party and you know what it is
Adventure on the m************ block
We here for more than a lot here is alright
Wassup, wassup, wassup
Hold on, hold on, hold on
You know, you know, you know
We know, we know, we know
Time to take charge, this is it
Every day's a party and you know what it is
I do it for the m************ block
About to get it hot like a pot see we rolling like

A bunch of pretty girls on the highway

(PURE)
Come f*** with a trill n**** roll out
All that you working show it out
It's call to the cops come to shut it down
Go round and round and go again
Put that a** on loco, and you know I'm in love with your coco
You love on that grind get it
So high off that ganja, lifted
Wassup, wassup, wassup
Hold on, hold on, hold on
You know, you know, you know
We know, we know, we know
I'm so automatic now work it
Knocking shots down you can call me curtain
I'm feeling like losing don't exist
Feeling so good it's about to get lucas
