Sheek Louch cummin' through wavin' the 4, 4
Night boots, black hudie, tell me who want war
Coke on the glass table, some rock vodka
Dutchie rolled, soaked 'n' quevlow gold

Ma swag is up, ma bars in tight
The house, the bitches, the jewelry, the cars is right
The hammer light, titanium
I'll put 3 in ya cranium
Like pop, pop, pop
Cannot stop

Now bring it back

It used to be 500 k in the closet
Now it's a couple M's every time I deposit
Tell the young boys it ain't really nothin', it's lojik
Stack whatever you get, don't spend, you got it

On top of that stay consistent with your product
Don't matter if it's just weed or if it's narcotic
Due time you'll be pullin' of the lot in something exotic

L O X gettin' stronger
Dblock gettin' stronger
Hip hop gettin' stronger
Chea, chea, chea, chea

Dblock gettin' stronger

Boss dundotta
Dance with the devil
Never bought the bitch product
You ain't gettin' notta

Pam won't light, I'm going light it hotta
Then a slug from my 4 pound
Like sum pretty pussy 1's
I'm a tear you all down
We can go to war now

L.O X muthafucka
Rich on a plane
Couple bucks 'n' ma trucka
Shoot from anywhere
Like niggas in the rukus

Gettin stronga, barral longa
Coup shorter, jar of dat water
Malinium flow
Kamora times 2, malinium hoe

Tattooed up diamond cross
Hip hops Randy Moss
Dump the whole clip and toss
Hottest group
Let the beef loup

And we barry you niggas
In yo pocket like kiss and jiggas
Big money, big car
And big cagars

Comas, frunaral
Wheelchairs paraplegics
Reel life so you gotta believe it
If you did have a goal
Then you gotta acheive it

'Cause your body stays hear
But your soul gotta leave it
Square feet, hot wheels
200 bricks 1 shot deals

'Cause every body down will pop pills
It's hard to top that
Point blank the goddest got crack
We U P S body parts back

I don't get the newest Benz
I get the newest house, newest business
I learned that from my Jewish friend
I brake bread with the Arabs

But I'm African
So I got doe chillen in the gray Calv
I could hit u with a hook
Or a straight jab

Or I could cock it back
'N' shoot you in ya face, hag
And you know I'm from Y O nigga
I got every kind of charger
Even the Y O nigga
