[Intro]
Nah, get the fuck out of here
Nah, I like some of that new shit
The shit is alright
But ain't nothing like that feeling when you throw that 90's gangster shit on
See what I'm saying?
Right there, all ya niggas said "oh shit"
Ha
Hell
A yo [?], man
I'm going in, God
I got him
[?]

[Verse]
We live the life that is diamonds and guns
We can go loud or we could pop with them silencer one
I threw my first hammer running from the boys
Then I went and got a stash box and all of my toys
Now I keep a little shooter that will take that
If I tell him, he'll show up where you wake at
Try to offer me some time, my nigga ate that
When it get rocky, my niggas move, ASAP
We come through, niggas look extra rich
Having fun, popping bottles, nigga, watch your bitch
Jealous niggas get taken care of
I ain't saying that you soft, but my niggas, you're fully aware of
Loyalty, grown, mad kids to feed
Semi-automatics, ya niggas will bleed
Twelve in the head, the headlines will read
Every show I do cause a stampede
Now look, I used to bag up in the plastic
Whoever thought We Are The Streets will be a classic?
We calm down before you get your ass kicked
And I'm still strapped, you ain't even got to ask it
Hold up, ain't no such things as halfway crooks
The Mobb said it best back then
I guess you new rapping niggas wasn't listening
But I don't judge 'em, I still play it
They ask me how I feel about it, I OK it
I'd be looking like a hating nigga if I say it, so I chill
Shoutout to all my street niggas loving that real
The foundation, heavy anticipation, SBG2
Them real niggas fucks with me
I fucks with them, hold your head up in the pin, my niggas

[Outro]
See what I am saying, son?
Ain't no feeling like this shit
A yo
Who let the monkeys out?
Yeah
A yo [?], turn that shit off
