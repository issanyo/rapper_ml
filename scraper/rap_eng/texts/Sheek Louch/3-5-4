[Sheek Louch]
A'yo four shots let off, black truck sped off
Big shit, tryna take a motherfuckin head off

A'yo hold up man, let me take y'all back to the begining
Let y'all know what happend that night, listen
I don't even know these niggas hangin in front
Usually we woulda been asked them what do they want
What they came here for, this is 354
What you tryna get some gas or some shit from the store
But nobody asked these motherfuckers what do they want
It was bitin, mad traffic, the first of the month
It was me, Chep, Bizzy and Hit
B. G. And Lickalone and yeah I think Earth was there and shit
And a few other niggas in and out of the buildin
Tryin to catch every sell but not to children
Got a sixty of that yack in the store in the back
Chep about to go home and get more of his pack
Jake ain't fuckin wit us, what's the miracle
Niggas moms ex heads now turn spiritual
Wanna preach to us talk about Christ
And how fuck sand, how he could bring the beach to us
That's when I noticed niggas still outside
Hoody on with some shades like they tryna hide
So I cocked the hammer then I walked to 'em
No beef, just a friendly little talk to 'em
Listen

[Sheek:] Here we go, yo whaddup money?
[Guy:] Yo whaddup
[S:] What y'all niggas waitin for somebody or somethin?
[G:] Yeah, why?
[S:] Nah nah, I'm sayin y'all niggas got on big hoodies and shit
Yaknahmean? It's my block out here daddy
I don't need blood on this shit and all that
[G:] It's all love, it's all good
[S:] Aight, just checkin dog

[Sheek Louch]
A'yo, turns out these niggas is not from here
And they got blood on they hands while they drinkin a beer
They just robbed Dread and them niggas spot
I told 'em they gotta get up out of here, they makin it hot
That's when four shots let off, a black truck sped off
Big shit, tryna take a motherfuckin head off
Bombaclot, no man rob me spot, everybody here feelin me Glock
They done put us in a mix now we gotta go to war with
Dread and them niggas cause they think we wit these dicks
Shots goin everywhere, everybody clappin but them niggas that was standin there
They fuckin disappeared
I cut one yardy underneath his fuckin beard
Still clappin, got everybody runnin scared
They ain't backin down and we ain't bitchin
Niggas comin out the house with the hitchelin under the michelin
Throwin back a clip or two
You would think we went to war with Colin Powells crew
Police comin now but we don't give a fuck
Rhas' tryna grab all his niggas in the truck
That's what I get for lettin niggas blend in
And they ain't really wit us, niggas really tryna get us
I keep my Glock not givin a fuck
But the bullshit is we still gotta watch for that truck

[Sheek Louch]
Yaknahmean, y'all niggas remember that night dog?
Only B. G. Had his gun on him man, word up
Styles P had his gun on him
Besides that niggas was fuckin naked man
Yall niggas didn't stop it man
Niggas had the drop on us kid
If homeboy didn't come thru, if he didn't come thru
And silence those guns dog, we woulda been sick
Check it out though, I know them faggot ass niggas kid
You know what the fuck I'm talkin about
Niggas just bought them s***s, that's why we had all them hammers
Besides that man, word up man, no wing niggas around us dog
If you ain't a motherfuckin friend of mine or friend of ours, you gotta go
Niggas is grimey man, it's D-Block for real man
You think these niggas don't want what we got?
Fuck yeah they want it
That shit we be rappin about
All that shit we be fuckin drivin around, these niggas is hungry man
I got somethin for that belly though
