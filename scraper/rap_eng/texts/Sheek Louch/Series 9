Bring It Back Lyrics
The L.O.X

[Intro]
Bring that back one more time
Bring that beat back
Ya’ll wanna hear that beat, right?
(D-Block!)
Bring that beat back

[ Verse 1: Sheek Louch ]
New York Flow
For years I’ve been getting’ New York dough
They know that my gun blow
Straight out that 914, either here or on tour
Got more pussy than AI B. Sure!
Arm leg or berreta out the bodega
Porsche lookin’ clean like a nigga hit Mega
I’m IMAX lookin’ when I walk
I’m a mix between Bill Gates and Kool G when I talk
Frontline on that bullshit
Donnie at the helm
This 9 millimeter more powerful than Selma
I’m sorry Dr. King, but these lil’ niggas they bring
More drama and more Kis than Alicia Keys can sing
When he come home from that thing
I’m straight out the P-jects
Bullets got niggas losing weight
Every day like the 40-day reset
But they respect me cause I’m Donnie the O.G Nigga

[ Hook ]

Bring that back one more time
Bring that beat back
Ya’ll wanna hear that beat, right ?
Bring that beat back

[ Verse 2: Styles P ]
It’s middle fingers or deuces
Versace head Medusas
Lil’ homie holdin’ a Ruger
Popping’ your medula, have ‘em hop in the Uber
We scuba divin’ in Cuba
We ain’t lookin’ for fish, we lookin’ for ritz
And I don’t mean an old bitch, but I’ll make you sleep
With a cougar
I’m hilarious, 9 carrier
I was livin’ the life, yours was vicarious
This gun could’ve had my seed, I would’ve married it
Goon at the end of the Grand Marquis Marriot
Head getting bigger like I just took the Barry shot
Bomb with a Bird if it’s good like a Larry shot
Yeah I’m from Yonkers but the work’s down in Tarry-
Town
Fuck around, bring that little shooter from Natty down
Hard, but the credit card’s the only thing I carry now
Nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]

Yeah
Up north flow
Leg day today, pardon me If I walk slow
You can see the hate, you can taste the salt though
They made my heart cold, I don’t feel no remorse yo
Nah, yeah
I need a whole block
A glass jar, ice tray, and a stovetop
A lil nigga lookin’ out, and an old Glock
The next day I’m comin’ through when the gold drop
Ha, stop
Nobody iller than me
You can catch a contact just chillin’ with me
Movin’ it ain’t really nothing’, it’s a killer to read
Form Voltron when I’m with Gorilla and P
We more than connected
You oughta respect it
Devil’s playground, but the lord is my shepherd
Yeah, a lot of niggas gon’ die
So as far as funerals there be more in a second

[Hook]
