[Chorus: Styles P]
Money, women and weed
Liquor, jewelry and V's
Come and party with G's
Become a part of this thing
What's the thing? Make the plan work
What's the plan? Keep the fam first
Money, women and weed
Liquor, jewelry and V's
Come and party with G's
Become a part of this thing
What's the thing? Make the plan work
What's the plan? Keep the fam first

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
(HA-HAAAEEH!)
If you ask me you should get your mouth wired (shut)
You'se a insider, talking to the outsiders
Provider and a earner (uh)
Lot of different styles, plus he stay with the burner (40..)
Mix the cookies with the haze
What's ya sneaker game like? You'se a rookie with the J's
Road trip from L.A. to Oakland
All we doing is filling up the tank and we smoking (light that)
You Piru'ing or your Loc'ing (umm)
Either way your appreciation is unspoken (true)
We move around like a carousel (uh)
These particular vibes are unparalleled, what?

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Donnie, Vybz Kartel, smoke like I'm a Rasta
Drink, then I see it clearer, look at the impostor
Fresh out the Federal, my nigga is home
Trifling though, he got my homie baby moms in his phone
Yeah, I don't want beef but I'm no chump
And I ain't with the politics either but fuck Trump
Bump-bu-bu-bu-bump
Yeah, that's that Berner and P
Sheek and Jada, bitches be like "OMG"
Who the fuck I am?
I been in this game, if you don't know, Shazam
This gangsta shit
Fuck your society, nigga, I ain't supposed to fit
I'm pretty nice on the mic, that's the most of it

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Let's make a toast to this
Let the mimosa hit
Purple punch and the clementine
Get knocked with the work
There's no one to identify
Mob, you a friend of mine, now we acquaintances
You can let a hundred fly, depending how link it is
It's smooth like furniture
I was on the plane, get the food saved for when I land
When you was out turning up
Foreign and my PlayStation, vacation burning up
Back to the studio, maybe 'cause I'm studious
Y'all niggas is dubious
Me I like the doobie, 'cause I doobing in the spa
When niggas gon' let the shooter in
You can play your hand first, all I know is fam first
I'ma get a couple drinks but light a couple grams first (Ghost..)

[Verse 4: Berner]
And let the ice hash bubble up
And fuck your double cup, I'm trying to fill a couple trucks
I want a grand in every one I touch
Yeah, the coke so dumb the whole area numb
I just buried two mil' and bought me a new gun
I put five in the air, sent the rest on the ground
Tell these fake drug dealers, stop taking our sound
This that fly shit
I just wanna get high and celebrate as soon as it arrives
9:00 AM flight, I'm on a plane a hunnid grand
I only rock with my fam
Fuck all these random hands out

[Chorus: Styles P]
