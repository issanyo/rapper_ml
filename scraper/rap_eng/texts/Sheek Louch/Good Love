[Intro]
Hey, I'm looking for {"Good love, yeah"}
Met a lot of women out there on tour
Ran through them all but I'm just not sure
{"Good love, I like that baby"}
Yeah, we're going to fight but I think that's just {"Good love, yeah"}
(That's the sound right here baby... it feels so good)
First class flights, almost home
But I {"Just can't keep still!"} Let's go:

[Verse 1]
Fresh off the plane, into the Bent'
Note a little more than what you pay for your rent
I'm tired of the road, no shows booked
Need something home cooked {"I like that baby"}
Straight in the door, straight to the floor
I'm already high but light up one more
Just got home I'm trying to chill but I {"Just can't keep still!"}
Gotta hit the block, get a little 'gnac
Fuck with the hood, see if niggas is good
Jake is on me asking me why my music all loud
I just tell him {"I like that baby"}
Throw a little dice, head crack twice
Light something up I'm starting to feel nice
They looping around, let me go and peel
Cause I {"Just can't keep still!"}

[Verse 2]
Hat low enough, short sleeves no cuffs
Aston-Martin sitting outside tough
Shorty shotgun, black Hillary Duff
Sheek do it big like I was down with Puff
Now I'm in the club, no V.I.P
I'm down low where every last hoodlum be
I feel baby boy trying to ice grill me
But I {"Just can't keep still!"}
Walk up to him, you know nice and polite
Let him now it's real, lift the shirt up light
I'mma let it off cause I ain't trying to fight
But, you dead right {"I like that baby"}
Anyway, I'm trying to see who else here
I see shorty staring at me way over there
I'm sorry baby girl but I gotta disappear
Cause I {"Just can't keep still!"} Ha ha ha~!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Betty Wright knocking, got 'em all rocking
About to do the electric slide on the block and
Yeah this popping, got them going crazy
From 8 to 80 {"I like that baby"}
It feels so good, you can't sit down
You gotta get up and move your fat ass around
You don't care who watching, you keeping it real
Cause you {"Just can't keep still!"} Let's go
