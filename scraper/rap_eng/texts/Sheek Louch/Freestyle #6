[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo; I ain't Ma$e but fuck it I'm back again - baby
Them hood niggas know I got crack again - baby
Chillin I ain't even been practicin - baby
But it's time to load the muh'fuckin mag again - aiyyo baby
I ain't heard nuttin yet that get me out my seat
Mixtape niggas callin like they ran out of heat
They want (shit) that make niggas get on the bar and do 20
(Shit) that make niggas go in the street and get money
Like Hot 97 I'll be callin you Sonny
I've been spittin back when your nose was still runny (lil' nigga)
These pussy-ass niggas all scared to death
While I watch, sit calm like Red & Meth
Clap off at a nigga, 'til it ain't no breath
If I don't hear shells droppin, it ain't none left
I met a lot of real niggas in time, I ain't gon' lie
It's only a handful that I met that can rhyme
Everybody else in my cool
Big linky young boys in the game, like Kareem Abdul
Niggas better stay calm, I'mma leave that jewel
Sheek worse than that bully, that you meet after school
And I don't give a fuck what you think doggie
Go across the street and play around with your walkie talkie
Get me a butter roll and a cup of coffee
I'm tryin to do graveyard and shake this monkey
Ahh! Yeah yeah the God is here
I feel love like when niggas brought A-Rod here
The iPod here, hundreds of songs
Niggas love me in the hood I'm like compared to Wongs
Muh'fucker!
