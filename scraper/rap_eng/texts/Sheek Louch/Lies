[Sheek Louch]
Stop frontin, aiyyo

[Hook 2X: Sheek Louch]
Lies, rumors, rumors, lies
Bricks, bundles, birds, pies
Murders, Bentleys, mansions, chill
Niggas'll fuck with you still

[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo fuck it nigga buck it nigga what'chu waitin for?
Him to get into his car and cock back the four?
Nah nigga, I ain't tryin to be up on the 4th floor
Of any hospital, lay him down before even score
Man up nigga, get out and stand up nigga
That's too small? Take this one it's a lil' bit bigger
Matter of fact c'mon, let's go in the store and get a beer
When we walk past each other, turn and pop him in his ear
What'chu shakin for killer? Ain't yo' ass a Guerilla?
I can't hear you, screw this fool, let's get us a chinchilla
There he go, see that nigga leanin on the sign?
I'mma ask him for a light, you go and snuff him from behind
Lay him down, take his coat, put it in his spine
Leave him dead so he can't identify the line
Ready nigga? What'chu mean chill?
You told me it was real where you from, and you get down with the steel
And you ain't got a problem doin no time in jail
Right? C'mon let's keep goin
I heard this soft nigga had a spot, he keep mucho dough in
So much coke all around, you might think it's snowin
But we gotta move fast, cause this kid'll blast
And put somethin kinda heavy in yo' mask
Keep shit tight, motherfucker is you ready to fight?
What'chu mean, let you out at the light?
Oh shit
