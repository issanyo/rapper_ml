[Intro: Sheek Louch]
D-Block
Chyeah, let's go

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Homie got a little bit of heart but he ain't got those weapons that'll rip you apart
I seen it in your face, you been frontin' from the start
You ain't really 'bout that life, you ain't livin' by the knife
Mother fucker, I'ma beast
One thing you need to know about me, nigga, I'ma beast
Got that Last Dragon glow around me, nigga, I'ma beast
Why the fuck you think these hoes around me? Nigga, I'ma beast
Keepin' goons in the hood around me, nigga, I'ma beast

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
You filthy bitch, you fucked my man
Oh, you still want this dick? Okay, I understand
I'ma beast, my gun's the beauty
My money's long, come watch the movie
I could send shooters at you, they bring weed back
Couple iPhones, fuck it, I need that
I take inventory, I'ma different story
I'ma hard nigga, Denzel in Glory
Hip-Hop is dead? I'm resurrectin' it
Yeah, your single's hot, but where's the rest of it?
We smoke all day, marathon
Real rude boy, boujee bon-ton [?]
No grocery store but it's a Family Dollar
Probably the richest nigga that drives a white Impala
Woo, still reppin' for the East
Ask my nigga Styles P all day he gon' tell you I'ma beast

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Homie got a little bit of heart but he ain't got those weapons that'll rip you apart
I seen it in your face, you been frontin' from the start
You ain't really 'bout that life, you ain't livin' by the knife
Mother fucker, I'ma beast
One thing you need to know about me, nigga, I'ma beast
Got that Last Dragon glow around me, nigga, I'ma beast
Why the fuck you think these hoes around me? Nigga, I'ma beast
Keepin' goons in the hood around me, nigga, I'ma beast

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Mask on, concentrate
Gloves on, contemplate
To kill a loved one, it get complicated
Niggas full of shit like they constipated
I'm used to bullshit, I'm a Yonkers native
A lot of likes, no love, of course
Could get triple-crossed on a double-cross
Let 'em hear the shot, fuck it, let the muzzle off
Niggas like to kill, guess it's for the love of war
What I don't understand is what they wanna hug your mother for
You gettin' it or get it again
Dirty money stink, funky dividends
No E-S-T, got E-S-P
Watchin' E-S-P-N then jump to T-N-T
You comin' in? Well, I'm waitin' for ya
Repercussions an introduction to Satan for ya
Welcome to the jungle, guerillas waitin' for you, Donnie G and I
You in the game and you just been penalized, kill 'em if he need to die
Weed in the red plum Porsche keepin' the dream alive
Money from all sorts of angles keepin' the team alive
If I got a problem with niggas, I let the nina fly
Ghost back, flow wit' me
I'm goin' places, travelin', the smoke with me

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
Homie got a little bit of heart but he ain't got those weapons that'll rip you apart
I seen it in your face, you been frontin' from the start
You ain't really 'bout that life, you ain't livin' by the knife
Mother fucker, I'ma beast
One thing you need to know about me, nigga, I'ma beast
Got that Last Dragon glow around me, nigga, I'ma beast
Why the fuck you think these hoes around me? Nigga, I'ma beast
Keepin' goons in the hood around me, nigga, I'ma beast
