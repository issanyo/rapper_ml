[Hook]
I’m wandering free
Just living in a dream
Everyday that goes by
It’s the same old thing

[Verse 1]
I mean, you was either getting money or you wasn’t niggaFor my niggas
That been out of town man, to my niggas locked up doing what they had to do
Cocaine price, down south niggas with mouth full of ice risking my life
Fishscale beams, cokeboy dreams, out of town niggas tryna organize a team
Hiding all my money, hiding where I live
Vest if I get shot I’m hoping that I live new face out here tryna blend in
But I don’t wanna shine so I’m watching what I spend
Even switch my ID, insurance and registration legal on the v
I’m so low key
Bitches want me to fuck em bad but I chill cuzs
I don’t want their baby daddies getting mad (uh)
My life has changed such a sunset on my new day
Over the horizon I know once in my life that the only way
Starting to show growth, moving work with ease
Pounds of that kush, halves and quarter keys Pills like GNC, vitamin shop
Everybody, white boys is comin’ to cop
My little shooter that I brought from up top
He stay packin but had a kid buy some chick out here now he slackin’
They caught my lil nigga comin’ out of the diner
Hit him up twice and his wig, but let that bitch live
Now he sittin’ on my nigga’s sofa playing X Box
Getting high while his stupid bitch cut up his rocks
My emotions telling me to go now so I load the 4 pound
But my old head told me to slow down (Damn)

I’m wandering free
Just living in a dream
Everyday that goes by
It’s the same old thing

[Verse 2]
Fuck these niggas man
Next week I get a call for a brick but I’m hearing that they crooked
And my lil homies life, I’m hearing that they took it
They try and get the God because my money is long
I killed this town, I’m a pop this nigga and be gone
Tell him meet me at the hotel on South and Atlantic
Next to Subways across from Bill the mechanic
I get out the car I hand him some shit
He hand me some money, I count it real quick now I’m ready to flip
I ask the nigga, do he know Felicia
He said naw, but he don’t know I had that bitch duct taped in the car
I pull out the thing, he started to run
I hit him once in his shoulder, he fell down then I stood right over
Looking at him eye to eye, fuck you and fuck these niggas in this town
Bitch nigga goodbye
