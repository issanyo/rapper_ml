[Verse]
Hey yo come here
Get the fuck over here
Hey yo this nigga fucking pulled up on this block
Waving his gun at nigga
Acting like he going to do something
Ain’t going to shoot this nigga huh
I don’t give a fuck who he cool with
I don’t give a fuck who he know over here
The next time he shows his mother fucking face
You all that shit straight
And you shoot nigga
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
