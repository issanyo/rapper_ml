[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
I'm a, G about mine
I'm always holdin' a nine
These niggas crossin' the line
I'mma leave it right in his spine
I regulate on these herbs
I'm sickening with the words
I pitched on these curbs
I'm Iron Mike with the birds
Hold up
Donnie mathematical
Golden cross, sabbatical
Black hoodie, black panther
Huey Newton, I'm radical
Fuck around with them boys
I'm sittin' low in the Taurus
Diamonds on my wrist-piece
Fifty-something [?]
The Silverback of the Rap
In front or back of the track
And from the back of the trap, we forever clappin' the Mac
I done seen niggas get shot
I done bagged up in the spot
I done ran when it got hot
I done slept on that cot
Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do
You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you
Get popped up, find yo ass chopped in two
Let's go!

[Hook: Styles P]
I'd rather be a have than a have-not
But there's a lot of shit that I'd rather not have
Drama, bein' a nigga that the shot blast
Hustlin', bein' a nigga that the cop pass
Smokin', sayin' to myself, "this will not last"
Lookin' at a bottle of pills, 'bout to pop half
I put a bullet in your body, yeah, the top half
You's a funny-ass nigga, I did not laugh

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Bloodshed, tears fall
Fuck the hero, it's the villain that we cheer for
Family, money, and weed, the things that I care for
[?] is a war, that I'm prepared for
Cold heart, black soul
I ain't got to be drunk to wild and let the gat go
Lyrically I'm on a whole 'nother plateau
Talkin' to the holy ghost, but we ain't in the chapel

[Hook: Sheek Louch (Styles P)]
Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do
You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you
You get popped up, find your ass chopped in two
(We'll kill you, that's what D Block will do)
Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do
You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you
You get popped up, find your ass chopped in two
(We'll kill you, that's what D Block will do)

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Niggas lettin' them hammers off
Givin' cocaine out like Santa Claus
The Phantom playin' Diana Ross
From a 'hood where niggas tell you to handle yours
You don't wanna be the one, that they light the candles for
Hit him in the face, broad day, like channel four
Ghost scientifical, think it is not typical
Holdin' a nickel-plate, killin', is not difficult
Gettin' money, imagine what I'm 'bout to do
You from D Block, I'll lay a nigga out for you
I'm a wolf, so I show 'em what the alpha do
Cut guts out, even chop a scalp or two

[Hook: Sheek Louch (Styles P)]
Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do
You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you
You get popped up, find your ass chopped in two
(We'll kill you, that's what D Block will do)
Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do
You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you
You get popped up, find your ass chopped in two
(We'll kill you, that's what D Block will do)
