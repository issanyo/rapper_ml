[Intro: Sheek Louch]
They don't belong here
We might as well let them out they cages (D-Block)
This whole fuckin' place is about to blow up, right?
Let them mother fuckin' monkeys out

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
(Yeah) All we do is grind (grind my nigga, just grind)
All we do is grind (grind my nigga, just grind)
Grind my nigga (just grind)

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
I got it, yo
Hey yo, I heard you niggas got robbed (word?), I took it
Got a lot of money in the bank (yeah), I don't look it
Used to mix that shit with bakin' soda, he cook it
Had it lookin' like vanilla brownies (D-Block!), then we chop it
I was travelin' through different counties, had to stop it when a nigga got a record deal
Couldn't do it, notoriety was gettin' real
I said screw it, now I'm gamblin' with fifty thousand (haha!)
I done blew it, put my dick up in your bitch mouth, let her chew it
Ijust tell 'em who I want dead, he can do it
I don't give a fuck who you know (who you know) or who you cool with
I don't fuck with niggas who I know (nah) and went to school with

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & Styles P]
I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind (yeah!)
And I just grind my nigga, just grind (just grind!)
And I just grind my nigga, just grind (yeah!)
And I just grind my nigga, just grind (on it!)
And I just grind my nigga, just grind

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Catch me with a silverback gorilla and a forty-five
Niggas feel mortified fuckin' with the Gods
Ghost is short, nigga, but I hold the fort, nigga
And I always been the wolf, who big dog in the yard?
I give your daughter a bag of water, a bump of cocaine
Don't you ever try fuckin' with the mob
I told Donnie to bring the Tommy, I bust a hunnid shots
'Cause I always been sharp, not a slob
Pour another drink, burn another J
You don't wanna see a dead man turn the other way
'Cause we be on our shit and they be on our dicks
Dead is for your bitch 'cause my niggas livin' rich
D-Block!

[Chorus: Sheek Louch]
I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind (let them mother fuckin' monkeys out)
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
And I just grind my nigga, just grind
