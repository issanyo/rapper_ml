[Hook: Sheek Louch]
We're going up the ladder, up, up the ladder
Where I stop, it really don't matter
As long as my pockets get fatter
Either way, y'all gon' let me shine

[Verse: J-Hood]
Soon as I enter the building, they trying to rush me
I'ma tell you from the jump, tell security don't touch me
It's humid and it's thumping in here
So packed, everybody's body touching their hair
Hey, yo, bartender, give me three bottles, matter of fact, make it five
The atmosphere is dead, so I'm 'bout to make it live
Hey, yo, Stick, where the dutchies at?
Twist something we could choke on, then we gon' bounce where the bunnies at
I feel like 'Pac 'cause all eyes on me
But I'm comfortable 'cause I got that four-five on me
It's like three to five, but it's too many dudes, so
It's hype and the DJ keeps screaming, "who, though?"
But it's cool, though, 'cause I see something I could push on
Brown eyes, thick thighs, ass like a cushion
I told her that I like getting wild
Then she whispered in my ear that she like my style, I'm like, "Wow!"

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
We're going up the ladder, up, up the ladder
Where I stop, it really don't matter
As long as my pockets get fatter
Either way, y'all gon' let me shine
We're going up the ladder, up, up the ladder
Where I stop, it really don't matter
As long as my pockets get fatter
Either way, y'all gon' let me shine
