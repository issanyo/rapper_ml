[Intro]
Pain (Pain)
Pain (Pain)
Pain (Pain)
The pain that a man has to endure
When two junior flip, hotrod-lovin', pig policemen
(Pain) put him in a position where he must choose
Against humiliation as a man or death
(Pain) leave your head, 'cause you outta be dead

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
Block-a, this is your brain on drugs
Love is pain and pain is love
Block-a, this your brain on drugs
Ya'll came with police, we came with thugs, uh
Ayo, I dropped pain on 'em, switched the game on 'em
Whoever out there hot, I'ma rain on 'em
I see niggas slowin' down, I'ma gain on 'em
No beef but fuck it, put his brain on 'em
Uh, left faces hurtin'
I'm in Yonkers, comin' down Burton in that thing with the curtain
Pants leg up, call me Sheek Cool J
Hat low, shorty from a Paris runway
The thing is loaded
Eatin' lunch with politicians and I don't even think I voted
They see my face, they think I'm rich (Yeah)
I'm by myself, they think I'm bitch (Never)
Until they layin, while doctors stitch (Ha-ha)
'Cause I clap like a nasty bitch (Eww)
You don't know me (Uh-uh)
You know my name, you heard my raps
But you don't feel my

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
(Pain) I got more than you lookin' for
(Pain) She backin' it up on the dance floor
(Pain) By herself, tellin' me she got more
(Pain) It ain't all bad, homie, it's somethin' good
(Pain) I got more than you lookin' for
(Pain) She backin' it up on the dance floor
(Pain) By herself, tellin' me she got more
(Pain) It ain't all bad, homie, it's some good
(Pain)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, yeah
Uh, sort of like an evangelist
'Cause you hear it but you don't know how to handle this
Uh, be it the nine or the knife
Everybody felt it at sometime in they life
It's all different kinds to endure
Pain is pure and most times it ain't no cure
That's why I'm in the hood, I don't be where the stars is
One of my records is platinum but all of my cars is
You pokin' no Mount Air-y lodges
I'm Germany, tall bust m√©nages, Trading Place
If you don't like the hand you was dealt
Just make sure you save your aces
Uh, and I'm gettin' a lil dividends
Big Boys think I'm distributin'
Divin' off yachts in the Carribean
Yeah, thats just the life that we livin' in

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
(Pain) I got more than you lookin' for
(Pain) She backin' it up on the dance floor
(Pain) By herself, tellin' me she got more
(Pain) It ain't all bad, homie, it's somethin' good
(Pain) I got more than you lookin' for
(Pain) She backin' it up on the dance floor
(Pain) By herself, tellin' me she got more
(Pain) It ain't all bad, homie, it's some good
(Pain)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
Ayo, I'm ridin' dirty
On the passenger side with just the permit, me and my birdy
Louis boots, Red Monkey jeans on
Jamaica chick get my sex in Queens on
Haze lit, blunt look finger-thick
Flow make 'em all fight like a springer chick
Sheek Louch and Jada-the-Mwa
Put them half dollar hoes on the side of your car
Don't never put your eye in the way
Dream like you livin' forever but live like you dyin' today
Uh, 38 is new, the 357 is a lil older
Everything else is for the shoulder
From here on, I spit it in rare form
Bruh, these niggas is either in the ground or airborne
And you just runnin' your mouth, stay in your house
If you don't know nothin' about no

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
(Pain) I got more than you lookin' for
(Pain) She backin' it up on the dance floor
(Pain) By herself, tellin' me she got more
(Pain) It ain't all bad, homie, it's somethin' good
(Pain) I got more than you lookin' for
(Pain) She backin' it up on the dance floor
(Pain) By herself, tellin' me she got more
(Pain) It ain't all bad, homie, it's some good
(Pain, pain, pain)
