[Swizz Beatz]
Swizz Beatz the monsta
Real music (real music) let's go

The hood's hot! (uh-huh, yeah) The hood's hot! (clap)
The hood's hot! (oh, yeah) The hood's hot (yeah, yeah)

[Verse One: Jadakiss]
Yo when I squirt the chrome the funeral home
Gon' double they money this year off my work alone
So cool with it, yet and still I'm old school with it
Nobody gotta know who did it
Two-thirds of the L.O., where the X at?
Hoodie under the suit jacket, double-breast that
I'm in the hood like scratch-offs, get them packs off
Lame niggas cuffin them whack whores
Use of the pick goin back door, no more for the fake
Just stand there and I'mma dish it back off
Might lay it up, might not
Niggas don't be in the wrong place cause it's me in the right spot
I'm quite hot, y'all niggas is quite pop
The record don't sell then I still got light rocks
Like wearin Timbs with Nike socks
And the lil' bit of money I did make I put it in light stocks

[Swizz Beatz]
Yeah, how y'all doin out there (Jada whattup nigga?)
How y'all doin out there? (It's your boy Sheek Louch nigga)
The hood's hot! (Thanks for invitin me on this track)
The hood's hot!

[Verse Two: Sheek Louch]
Yo if my flow too tight, put the pressure on
Watch the juice come out like I'm squeezin a Sprite
Make big deals, get out on big bails
Shit, your career about as short as Amil's (ha ha)
Shit on niggas like I had two tails (damn)
With enough bars to open four jails
If you don't know nigga, ask Madden
How I play with the hammer, in Manhattan
Shank up (yeah) niggas leak enough blood
To fill a motherfuckin H-2 tank up
Getcha bank up (yeah) who you rank up
Get off his dick and get you a brick (woo!)
We done seen every John Woo flick
So act like The Killer instead of some chick (bitch)
Fuck a pimp cup, get a plastic one (no doubt)
Put some 'gnac in that shit and go and get it done

[Swizz Beatz]
How y'all doin out there? (You know what they want right)
How y'all doin out there? (They want that gangsta shit from us daddy)
The hood's hot! (So let that shit hit you)
The hood's hot!

[Verse Three: Sheek]
Me and 'Kiss hot like lava (no doubt)
We got sons in the game and we don't need Maury to know who the father
If we don't know you, your bars ain't big enough (nah)
You need a gimmick, go run around the block with Puff
Get a Black Phone, rent some of Jigga's stuff
I'm like T-Dub, you wanna be dubbed (no doubt)
I was there when a lil' nigga re'd up
You ain't Willie, you just act G'd up

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, uh, yo
I branched out, so you can get the deez
In the glass seam bags you can pull the stamps out
Nigga the champ's out, we don't rock loud colors
We pop loud guns nigga to stand out
You know what it is kid, your man got the money in his crib
Then we gon' go in your man's house
Double R D-Block nigga the camp's out
Can't forget about Swizz, he blowin the amps out, what?

[Swizz Beatz]
How y'all doin out there?
How y'all doin out there?
The hood's hot!
The hood's hot!
