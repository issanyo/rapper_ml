[Hook: Sheek Louch]
So what we pack guns? Put hash in our weed
So what we sell drugs? We got kids to feed
We hustle all night
Fuck hoes and get right
And you know we love to fight

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Dutch rolled; smokin' my reefer
Drinkin' my 'yac; had to borrow this from Snoop and Khalifa
I'm feelin' like today is Easter; I'm so fresh
Ten in the game; still considered the best
"Anything for my son" across my chest
Lovin' the streets, so I ain't that pressed to put on a vest
Watchin' Wade, everybody think that they winnin'
Season started later, press me, do it from the beginnin'
Still Kobe; whips European, Ginobli
We smoke weed like it's a bogey; I'm so high
Drink, pop a Vicodin, and Donnie ready to fly
O-T trunk full of Lady Gaga
I clap at these niggas for Kiss; I be a blood donor for P
If he ask me, I'd cut off my wrist, and let it drip into his I.V
It's all real; Donnie G dot, dot, millionaire
They ask me, "is the feeling gone?"
Push button, bitch; ask me where the ceiling gone
Winter time; heat blowin' with my ice showin'
Ayo Styles, do me a favor (what?), keep flowin (ok)

[Verse 2: Styles P]
So what I blow weed and keep plenty of hash on me?
Run up in the spot with the burner and mask on me
Sold cocaine, and keep plenty of cash on me
I lay you out if my homie is askin' me
You don't understand, then you got some audacity
Street life is rough, yeah, it takes some tenacity
Louch say "kill 'em", or Kiss tell me to "kill 'em"
I'll blow your brains out, nigga, I'm thick with 'em
I'll smoke a nigga and tell 'em the fifth did, dutch did it
Go 'head, nigga, fuck with it
Come through with your ice; I'm gettin' you stuck with it
Go 'head and play the man if you want
You know Ghost, dumpin' seven grams in the blunt
And I got the killers in the van in the front
Mad high, like so what nigga?
You don't like me? Fuck you; you [?] nigga

So what we pack guns? Put hash in our weed
