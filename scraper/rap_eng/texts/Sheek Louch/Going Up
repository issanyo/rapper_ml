[Verse One: Skyzoo]
I promise you that we going up
And that tag when we get up there so you know its us
Make it and where all the winters is approaching us
Either that or the distance is getting smaller
Witness what you recall, the coming of where we met
Habits to new money its spot like we spent
Drop right on the benz, if the scenery on
And know if something get in you see me like the mob
Planning for all that to be the summer
And every summer after for as long as we wanna
What we be calling a come up, and if it ever turns past tense
Then that means that we up and now you should add wins
Still know how it feels to have ends that never meets
Will never leave, never breathe without
Being drefted in the shit that make you all check
And never knowing what it is that I ever want less

[Bridge]
Can't you see that we're going up

[Hook: Ray Hill]
Yes we're living it up
Baby baby bitch we come and conquered it all
Yes we're going up Up

Heavy grind so we don't get no sleep, we counting paper everyday of the week, like its easy

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
2Deep what up Fam, Sheek Louch

Ayo, I'm a different animal, cannibal I eat these niggers
Different levels, I barely even speak these niggers
Years in the game, I still look the same
If you die hard in the street, well I never hear your name
Looking down at niggers while I'm sittin on the plane
Certified G, LOX comes in three
Sheek can make coco leave an ice tea
And she dont need a molly on motherfucking E
Hand on my rube, ready to shoot
All black, I don't come outside to look cute
Why pray down, nigga lay down
Put your face on the floor when I open up the door
Donnie on the draw, like coke in the straw
Overseas money, all I do is tour
My crew don't Sleep, These diamonds ain't cheap
Sheek Louch! D-Block and 2Deep D-Block!
