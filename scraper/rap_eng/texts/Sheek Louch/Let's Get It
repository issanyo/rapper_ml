[Verse 1: Styles P]
Welcome to the world of the Trinity
Spit on a cop, piss on my enemy
Told you that I smoke to get rid of negative energy
Lyrically sick and killin' you was the remedy
Bullet is little but a slug'll tear out your memory
Like livin' rich 'cause I sorta dig the amenities
Gat on my lap gettin' mancured
Coke head at the plug, test ... (?)
Got the K and I call it drunk the janitor, you know I got it ready to sweep
I got goons in my ear like I'm ready to eat
Beef with me, find the roof, and get ready to leap
G-Host, Al-qaeda, Donnie G (Lox)
Armani suits, Mazeratti Vs
Want money like we Andrew Carnegie
Body in broad day, Broadway honorees

[Hook]
We don't give a fuck about you niggas
We don't give a fuck about you bitches
Niggas know we lit 'cause we lit it
You could live or die, what's the difference?
All my niggas hustlin', yeah, let's get it

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Yeah, uh, crack spot stories
Hand on my gun, smokin' sour
Playin' on my Xbox One
Incarcerated Scarfaces playin'
Two hundred thousand large in the bag, nigga fuck what you sayin'
This the trio
Been nice since Malcom was Theo (?)
Now I'm grown, these bitches wanna kiss on my pee hole
See the difference is we do it for the hood, you do it for your label
That's why your career's not stable
Hah, I make niggas jump out and get wreckless
Stick up niggas comin' home with your necklace
Laugh about it with New Ports for breakfast
We hungry niggas, we want you to come test us
Hah, black bottles and some college bitches
Jell-O shots and a buncha Instragram pictures
Wavin' the four pound, Benjamins is still hotter than what's out right now

[Hook]
We don't give a fuck about you niggas
We don't give a fuck about you bitches
Niggas know we lit 'cause we lit it
You could live or die, what's the difference?
All my niggas hustlin', yeah, let's get it

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
You know what it was right after I lit the L up
Headshot, instantly, the brain swell up
You gon' see the pictures right after they get developed
First you break everything down, then you sell up
Can't get outta the paint, still pivotin'
Your talkin' and your means of livin' ain't equivalent
Least send a nigga a kite if you can't visit him
Drug dealers, slash, tax payin' citizens
You can take a dollar or you can take a Shahada
A single parent home will raise you to hate your father
Personally, I rather kill you, I hate to rob ya
And this is just gonna continue so hate the saga
I do it the Don way
If you got into a Ford and do it the Tom way
You don't wanna see the Lord then do what the Don say
Far as I'm concerned, all y'all niggas is entrees
Let's eat, niggas

[Hook]
We don't give a fuck about you niggas
We don't give a fuck about you bitches
Niggas know we lit 'cause we lit it
You could live or die, what's the difference?
All my niggas hustlin', yeah, let's get it
We don't give a fuck about you niggas
We don't give a fuck about you bitches
Niggas know we lit 'cause we lit it
You could live or die, what's the difference?
All my niggas hustlin', yeah, let's get it
