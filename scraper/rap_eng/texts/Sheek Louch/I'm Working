[Intro]
Yeah
They say real talk right

[Verse 1]
Smoking out the window looking out this place
Young bagging up rocks pockets full of base
I don't mean to be disgraceful
Sorry black man but the Porsche is looking tasteful
I mean Mom know where it's from but
I can tell that she grateful
Shit if you get money nigga ain't no time to be hateful
Let them hate though fuck it
Car look like there's a parachute on it
Bitch look Egyptian I can tell that you want it
Step your game up
If you don't wear jewels step your dame up
Get money nigga
On the good weed, step your flame up
I'm so high right now
Every hood bitch in here look fly right now
Pass the rolls giving molly's to these bitches
Shades on can't see my eyes in pictures
The scriptures read I'm a Don
I was built for the long run the marathon
In the words of Farrakhan: I can't take it with me
That's cool but I'm leave my son a couple mill before I'm 50
I got you junior
I have fun with that Gwop
Get off your block and get off my cock nigga
Let's go

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
My nigga I'm workin'
I'm grindin'
Hustling and earning shaking and learning
Making and waking
Well I've been stepping my game up
So My nigga I'm workin'
I'm grindin'
Killing my haters on site
Earning my daylight
I'm so ambitious
My nigga I'm working
