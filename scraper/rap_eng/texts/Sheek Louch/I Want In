Brrrrrr
Its GUCCI
Yeah
What up
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
They say a bird in your hand beats a bird in the bushes
Couple birds in the bag couple bags of the kush
Gucci Mane and Jadakiss, yeah we armed and dangerous
Got to be a dope boy, weed seller to hang with us
And this purp is really loud and my diamonds really loud
Turn the shit down, passing kush out to the crowd
And I'm too turnt up you can't really turn me down
I'm from East Atlanta, Zone 6 that's my side of town
You a clown like in a circus and I knew that it'd surface
Sunday night and I'm not working so I drop my top on purpose
I got white I got green I got purple I got brown
Clientele all through the city nigga Gucci get around

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
No you can't come in
If you sell a nick nigga I want in
Got two hundred pounds that just came in
She just popped a pill and it just kicked in
I used to sell breakdowns until nights end
Now I got a trap house on that dead end
If you ain't buying dope then you ain't my friend
It's a pool full of sharks nigga go dive in

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
Bottles every night different women every night
Pool full of sharks nigga screaming for his life
If it's loud enough I can move ten of 'em tonight
Balling, Imma Jeremy Lin-em for the night
You don't really know him never send him for the white
Say the Lakers need to trade Kobe send him for Dwight
Lil' something for your nose, lil' something for your Sprite
Get it how you live you can pump it all your life
Getting two for fives, yeah, three for tens
If you ain't coppin' hell nah we ain't friends
King of New York that's what I've been
If a nickel bag sold in the park I want in

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
No you can't come in
If you sell a nick nigga I want in
Got two hundred pounds that just came in
She just popped a pill and it just kicked in
I used to sell breakdowns until nights end
Now I got a trap house on that dead end
If you ain't buying dope then you ain't my friend
It's a pool full of sharks nigga go dive in

[Verse 3 - Sheek Louch]
Don Don hoodie on plastic face, bastard case
Pop off leave them boys paralyzed below the waist
Dope money, street money, even more up in Chase
Lawyer money on deck ain't worried 'bout a fucking case
We let that sour burn, we been the nicest in the game for all these years and I still don't feel it's our turn
Rollie underneath the cardigan, thousand single in my hand
Let them stripping bitches know it's on again
And my chain gon' keep on glowing, popping pills, Dutch blowing Any hood that I'm in you see that Desert handle showing
I'm a beast mother fucker, you can't do it like this
Don Don, Gucci Mane, Ride for my nigga Kiss

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
No you can't come in
If you sell a nick nigga I want in
Got two hundred pounds that just came in
She just popped a pill and it just kicked in
I used to sell breakdowns until nights end
Now I got a trap house on that dead end
If you ain't buying dope then you ain't my friend
It's a pool full of sharks nigga go dive in
