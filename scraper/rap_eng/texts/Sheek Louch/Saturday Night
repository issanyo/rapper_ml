Song:   Saturday Night

There's nothing like a Saturday y'all
Quite like it, a Saturday

Saturday morning I wake up and I'm rising to the sun
I hear sweet music
It's no ilusion
I've got to run
Don't want to lose, no baby
Cos you know tonight is the night
We cannot lose,no baby
Cos I know the feelings so right
So East side sing it
Lets all put the night in motion
Bring it baby
The time flys by so easily
We've got to say that there is no other day
Like Saturday
Like Saturday

I'm telling you (aah)
There's nothing like a Saturday night
Nothing like a Saturday
(the weekends just begun)
Jump in the ride
Let us ride this rhythm thru the night
(the weekends just begun)
Everyone is calling, calling me up, just the same
For tonight for today
You know it's Saturday (oh oh)
Don't want to lose, no baby
Cos you know tonight is our night
Oh yeah (night) yeah (night
We cannot lose, oh baby
Cos the feeling is so tight
So West side sing it
Lets all put the night in motion
Won't you bring me
The time goes by so easily
We've got to say that there is no other day
Quite like a Saturday

I'm telling you
There's nothing like a Saturday night
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
(the weekends just begun)
Call up the crew
Cos there's nothing like a Saturday night
Ah break it down

Ain't nothing like a Saturday
Or Zhane (yeah, Hey)
Tomorrow you can sleep all day
Tonight we gonna party from the club to the street
Keep the vibe going from the West to the East
Keep the ? on (c'mon)
Play you last pawn (right)
It's Saturday we ain't hurting nobody
Shorty and the ? keeping the nails tight
Looking all sexy for the club tonight
I'm telling you there's nothing like a Saturday night
Everythings right
Like chill on the white
No need to be depressed
When you already escaped the Monday to Friday stress
Best be ?
If your feet hurt, take your shoes off today
I just know, everything will be okay
Cos there's no day like a Saturday

I'm telling you (aah)
There's nothing like a Saturday night (aah oh baby, oh baby)
Call up the crew
Cos there's nothing like a Saturday night
(weekends just begun)
I'm telling you
There's nothing like a Saturday night

Repeat and fade
