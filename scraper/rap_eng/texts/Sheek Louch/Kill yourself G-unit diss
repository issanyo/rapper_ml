[Sheek Louch-Verse1](Sheek Talking)
Ayo
Your lil' house party was cute and shit
I shoulda came there with a suit and shit, you lil' industry bitch(Haha)
"they dont know kiss in Africa." shut up snitch(fuck out of here)
I know sway wanted to ask you way more than he did
Like, why the fuck supreme and them doin a bid(damn)
And why can't you come around where you hung as a kid
You turn soft on niggas since you got on top
I know queens can't be proud of candy shop(nah)
Look, you ain't got to make that trash nomore(fuck is this)
You rich so everything gon' move out the store
So the next time ima hear you, if it ain't that raw(what?)
Ima tell the hood to close the door
Last chance 50, you betta bring it(last chance 50)
And i dont mean sing it
Let that new bitch witch do that, whadd up baby(whadd up baby)
Ill fuck you and ill smurf ya head(Haha)

[Chorus]

[Sheek Louch-Verse2](Sheek Talking)
