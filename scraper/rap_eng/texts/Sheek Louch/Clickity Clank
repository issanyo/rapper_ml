Hit me nigga
Okay
Ayo were my beer at son?
Fuck it son, let's go in

[Verse: Sheek Louch]
Ayo clickity clank, that piggy bank shit is garbage
I thought it'll be harder than that
I thought G-Unit niggas work harder than that
I mean most of the shit that I'm hearing is wack
Young Buck I ain't gon' lie, I like the dude
But its war and anyday I'll eat ya food
Lloyd Banks took Fab whole style
Like you ain't know
All you missing is his chipped tooth smile
And homie I ain't never gon respond to you
I dont care what you say or what the fuck you do
You don't deserve no raps
Take your old ass home and take a nap
You garbage nigga (ha ha)
Yall not scary
Thought the hardest come from Yonkers
I know yall wasn't talking bout Mary
You diesel fag stay in the car
And go G-G-G-G, all day in ya sports bra
I'm in the hood dick
Member the place you used to come to, when ya shit didn't break
Before Emimen ever heard the shit you kick
When you can walk around without none of your click
I don't care about your money dog
No hatin' either
We can do this all day and I dont need a breather
I want yall to shut us down
How that sound
My name too strong you clown
Guaranteed this the can of worms
You might wanna put the top back on
Before your ass get germs
Back then niggas wanted us to air yall out
I said 'Nah I kinda like what them niggas about'
Before I knew about the rattin'
Before you locked up half of Manhattan
Irv and his boys
Before you ran around in them bulletproof toys
I thought you was a problem child
I see niggas turn bitch when the shit get wild
Ayo 10 mil nigga or 20 mil sold
You bout to lose to niggas thats gold
I'll explode on homey
I like being out but I'll unload on homey
Lets keep this peace dog
Cause you and me both got them big old heats dog

[Outro]
Fuck outta here nigga
Ya shit garbage B
You don't sound Southern motherfucker
That fake ass laugh and shit
You do that laugh so niggas don't see you cryin'
D-Block bitch
You fucked up now, you know yo done fucked up now
Sheek Louch whatcha gonna say bitch WOO! .... it's nuttin
Ayo Game what up my nigga, you know what it is already
Henchman what up daddy
Whatever, whatever we right here man
Let's go
