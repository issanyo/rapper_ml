What must I go through to show you shit is real
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel
Rob and I steal, not cause I want to cause I have to
And don't make me show you what the MAC do
If you don't know by now then you slipping
I'm on some bullshit that's got me jacking, niggas flipping
Let my man and them stay pretty and I'ma stay shitty
Cruddy it's all for the money, is you wit' me?
Get the bitches, and I'll commit the crime
And when it's on we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit them we'll take your cap
Bust it off dusting off the softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth, yo let's off this nigga
Up North this nigga never made a sound
Breath too fucking hard and you're getting bust down

[Hook: Sheek, DMX]
Yo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)

Yo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)
(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)

Nowadays it ain't looking too good for certain niggas, I'm hurting niggas
(What you doing?) Robbing niggas, jerking niggas, sticking niggas
Cause they deserve it; when money got murdered
They know he died slow cause they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up the spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
It just takes a light up to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
When you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm facing time
I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasing mine
I soak it all up like a sitting fly
Cause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high
I live to die, That's where I'm headed
Let your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it

[Hook]
Yo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)
(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)
Yo, yo y'all niggas wanna be killers (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us (get at me dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me dog)
(Rrrrrr arf arf, what the deal)

[Verse 3: DMX]
One in the back wit ya faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathing, but you dead from the waist-down
The fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking
And I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walking
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under their eyes like a surprise to the guys
That one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you yo Baltimore shit (ah-oh!)
Knahmean? I'm just robbing to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street
When we're starving, we eat whatever's there
Come on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York
Transforming-ass niggas'll get it quick
And yo for real that nigga K can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me
Cause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling like white bitches in a scary movie
AHHH! You know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas it's like: "Protected by Viper, stand back"
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
The fuck you want me to do with this coward? Finish him, it's ended
(*EXPLOSION*)
