[Verse 1: Dresta]
Bang bang bang pull the trang as I shoot my shit
And I flaunt my gift leaving another stiff
It's me, the D, yeah, the Compton thug
I get down like mud when I'm high of bud
Little Sally Walker, jacking from a saucer
Sally wanted dick so the gangsters quick to toss her
Niggas wasn't knowing Gangsta Dresta's kinda loco
Always out for mo' hoes
So put the lock on your hoes
When I come around I get around like 2Pac
But you jock, the same little hoes that the crew got
Didn't you get mad when you found out I dug her
'Cause that's about the same time you realized you love her
Nigga, who the bitch is you the bitch, I guess
If you knew the bitch, you know
How to do the bitch, screw the bitch
And send the hooker on her way
Sucking like I did my bitch, Jesse Mayer
The Compton thug, getting love by many
But I'm hated by masses, so fuck they asses
Niggas say they men and they large, but they so alone
Bitches got niggas putting chrome to they dome
Going out asshole motherfucking backwards
To kill the frustration why don't you just blast her
But no, you'se a sucker stupid motherfucker
You'd rather let a bitch drive you dead to the gutter

[Hook x4: Dresta]
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another sucker

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Niggas wanna fight me over they bitch
Not knowing the bitch is a trick and she be all up on my dick
But yet he still loves her, kisses and he hugs her
Wanting to squab with your homie over a bitch now that's a buster
You better recognize and realize the fucking facts
With some shit kicked, who gonna watch ya back?
Your homie or that bitch? Nah, that bitch is gonna break
Leave your ass stranded for dead 'cause that bitch is just a snake
If I were you and that bitch tried to play me
I would just 'buck buck', rock-a-bye baby
Bury that bitch six feet in a ditch for trying to sucker me
Let her know that I'm a G and I'm staying sucker-free

[Hook x4: B.G. Knocc Out]
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another sucker

[Verse 3: Dresta]
You better learn to be strong
Try to be a bigger figga instead of going out
Damn, down goes another nigga
Catch yourself and try to check yourself
And don't neglect yourself before you wreck yourself
It's gonna be a long day
You going out the wrong way
You better pay attention to the words that my song say
Don't be a sucker! Don't be a buster!
Don't be a trick, man, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch with the nine
If she blow your mind grab the AK-ray
If she wanna play games, bitches try to date ya
Try to snake ya, wanna take ya
Wanna try to break ya, but it's in they nature
Wake your ass up don't be a sucker all your life trick
Clear yourself of that bitch she'll be upon the next dick
Killing yourself makes you nothing but a buster
Especially for a bitch, damn, down goes another sucker!

[Hook x5: Dresta]
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another nigga
Down goes another sucker
