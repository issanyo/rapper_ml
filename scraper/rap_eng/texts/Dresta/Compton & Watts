[Intro: Dresta]
Hahaha, this is for all you fools that don't know what's up yet...
Hahaha.. fool

[Verse 1: Dresta]
I come rough, I come real rough and get enough stuff
Demolition buster, leave 'em lookin' like suckers
I'm a bastard, not an actor, bitch attractor
Momma was my daddy because daddy wasn't a factor
Back on the block: Compton & Watts
Could smoke rocks together
[B.G. overlapping] Compton & Long Beach together?
Nigga, never! Ever got along
It's the same song I'm singin' when I'm bringin' the deal
You gotta respect how I feel - it's real
I chill with my homies and have a ball
If you can't speak the truth, nigga, don't speak at all, nigga

[Hook x4]
Compton & Watts gets much props
Back on the block, pop the Glock 'cause we can't stop, can't stop

[Verse 2: Dresta]
It's time for the phony and the fakes to devour
And separate the real deal niggas from the cowards
Never respect a nigga that's tryna be somebody else
I could respect a nigga more that's tryna rap and be yourself
You gotta speak what you feel
And gotta speak what you been through
You never seen cell but speak that you been to
You think you get respect if you lies that you did time
With everybody around you already know you never did crime
See, I did mine but I don't think it makes me bigger
'Cause I figure in or outta jail - I'm still a real motherfucking nigga

[Hook x4]
Compton & Watts gets much props
Back on the block, pop the Glock 'cause we can't stop, can't stop

[Break: Dresta & B.G. Knocc Out]
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts

[Hook x3]
Compton & Watts gets much props
Back on the block, pop the Glock 'cause we can't stop, can't stop

[Verse 3: Dresta]
A product of the projects when I flex or wrecks the set
And brothers checkin' they hoes because they breakin' they necks
To tryna see: the D, the R, the E, the S-T-A-ster
The Dresta - the Westside Compton Gangsta
I keep my homie with me every time I'm drivin'
Not talkin' about my nigga, homie, I'm talkin' about 4-5-in
Strivin' to be the best that I can be
But it's kinda fucked up in the C-P-T
Tryna move up but something tryna hold ya back
Police jack for crack, niggas jack for lack
Watch yo back! This fucked up world is getting worse
Every other day, another nigga and another hearse
Pop, pop goes the Glock 'cause we can't be stopped
Much props to Compton & Watts

[Hook x9]
Compton & Watts gets much props
Back on the block, pop the Glock 'cause we can't stop, can't stop

[Break: Dresta & B.G. Knocc Out]
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts
Compton & Watts

[Hook x4]
Compton & Watts gets much props
Back on the block, pop the Glock 'cause we can't stop, can't stop
