[Intro: B.G. Knocc Out]
Haha, yeah
Orginal Baby Gangsta's in this motherfucker, ha
With ith the D-R-motherfuckin'-E, hu. In a.. what we gonna do right now?
("Dog catchers about to get ya")
We serve these marks from the Dogg Pound, killa. Check it out
("Dog catchers about to get ya")

[Verse 1: Dresta]
Easily I approach the microphone because I ain't no joke
Nigga tell Kurupt, Nate and Daz I'mma buck 'em
Matter of fact tell that whole Pound I say fuck 'em
It's a new year so put the bustas in their plizace
B.G. Knocc, Gangsta Dresta bring it to your fizace
Ryders on a mission, I catch you slippin'
You gettin' struck clown
So fuck any busta down with the Mutt Pound

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
It's the Compton City G, nigga
Bow to your knees, nigga
Run up in your hood cock back my strap and pull the trees, nigga
And if you slippin', you know I'm gonna wet ya
I'm the baby boss hog, better known as the Dogg catcher
Bow wow, yippee yay, did you hear me say
I'm a Dogg killa, cause all Doggs have they day
Now don't run up on me, if you ain't prepared to fight
Little Knocc Out can't be phased, baby gangsta for life, nigga

[Hook x2: Dresta]
Dat Nigga Daz (killa)
Kurupt (killa)
Dr. Dre (killa, mark ass niggas)
Snoop Dogg (killa)
Nate Dogg (killa)
Tha Dogg Pound (killa)
Fuck, fuck all y'all, niggas

[Verse 3: Dresta]
I bring the noise every time a nigga wind me up
I pull my Nine and blow a mind, every time I bust 'em
I trust no man and that's from now until infinity
Nigga you either my homie or just consider yourself my enemy
Niggas out here fake dog, like Nate Dogg
I swear you made it, but talkin' that shit to Dre
Will get you and your DJ regulated
Bitches come a dime a sack, so let's get it straight
A fake is what I hate, so fuck Kurupt, Daz and Nate

[Verse 4: B.G. Knocc Out]
Motherfuckin' fake
Niggas be thinkin' that they can get with the real deal
What I would do if I was you is take a chill pill
Yet and still tricks, I gave your click a pass
But when I see that busta Daz I gotta bank his ass
Smash, down another puppy pound clown
With the round from my Smith and watch his body shift
Drift his soul in the wind as they carry you
And B.G. K-O can dig your hole before they bury you

[Bridge x2]
(Pranksters, studio gangstas, bustas)
(Softer than a bitch but portrayed the role of gangsta)
(Pranksters, studio gangstas, bustas)
Stupid motherfucker
(Yeah, that's what I'm sayin')

[Verse 5: B.G. Knocc Out]
So now you niggas know who in the fuck you fuckin' with
B-G and D-R-E, nigga, the baby gangsta clique
As we did some gangsta shit from a real G's perspective
Niggas get all like pumped while I stay calm and collective
I check those suckas they callin' self and causin' ruckus
'94 set claimin', Snoop, D-O bangin bustas

[Verse 6: Dresta]
Much love to the B-G, C-P-T
Much love to the D-R-E, O-B-G
Much love to the Eazy-E, C-P-T
And D-P-G don't wanna see us, see see
You fools ain't nothin' but marks, so fuck your set
Now what's next, I doubt if you wanna flex, no respect
Run up and get wrecked
You tried to diss the B.G., although we let that shit pass
Daz you fuck around and find your ugly ass
Smashed in a trash bag, fool
You wannabes gonna be layin' down
If you keep fuckin' around with the Compton Dogg Pound Killers

[Hook x2: Dresta]
Daz (killa)
Kurupt (killa)
Dr. Dre (killa, mark ass niggas)
Snoop Dogg (killa)
Nate Dogg (killa)
Tha Dogg Pound (killa)
Fuck, fuck all y'all, niggas
Fuck, fuck all y'all, niggas
