{"Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie! Gangsta boogie.."}
Nigga nigga nigga I'm from

[Hook : will.i.am]
(Compton, Compton, Compton)
It's the home of America's gangsta rap
The place of danger where
The {"Gangsta boogie"}, the {"gangsta boogie!"}
The {"Gangsta boogie"}, the {"gangsta boogie!"}
Where the cops is crooked, and them bitches is killas
And them niggas hold it down like black guerillas, where
The {"Gangsta boogie"}, the {"gangsta boogie!"}
The {"Gangsta boogie"} - nigga nigga nigga I'm from (Compton)

[Verse 1 : The Game]
Yeah, The Game on fire, check the gold wires
Hip-Hop on lock like some muh'fuckin pliers
Me and Will.I.Am yeah we take niggas higher
Niggas talkin shit get your fuckin mouth wired
Walking through Compton, Eazy still alive
Raider hat to the back throw your dubs in the sky
My flowetry wicked, sit back while I kick it
And do it like Dre did it, N.W.A. did it
I cook crack like the first nigga that ever bought a brick
From a ese, nigga I could write an essay
About all the gangsta niggas that I seen lowridin
In they Chevys with a bitch riding shotgun reppin L.A
Crips, Bloods, homes going loco
My Glock to me, is like Ice Cube and Yo-Yo
Sitting in a low-low, on chrome spinners
Nobody drop nothing this winter, nigga I'm from

[Verse 2 : Hook]

[The Game]
Nigga I smoke chronic, ain't shit changed
Since Young MC and Eazy-E was rapping "We All in the Same Gang"
Some niggas chain hang, other niggas gangbang
I do both cause I'm the king of the motherfucking West coast
Kick the door open, Will let's go
Flow like Esco', New York niggas say I'm the best yo
Hard like Timbos, blowing on indo
Niggas try to play me, get stretched out like a limo
I was chopping crack when Dre was banging my demo
And all you old niggas is washed up like N.O
Don't take it the wrong way, I got love for my kinfolk
Can I get a moment of silence Will bang the instrumental
I spit for my niggas in the line-up
That'll never see the sun again, so I close my blinds up
First album sold them out, Impalas rolled them out
Cause the whole motherfucking world wanna know about

[Verse 3 : The Game]
Welcome to the city of G's
Where we eat fried chicken, rice, and black-eyed peas
Fans got us in-the-scope, like Jimmy Iovine
Cause we Ruthless, like Will before the Black Eyed Peas
Fuck all rappers, look at all the hate I see
I'm sick, you can't get rid of me, I'm HIV
Nigga get another job, hip-hop is not hiring
I'm the reason Dre feel comfortable retiring
I just might put out "Detox" myself
Smoke so much, I check in detox myself
One man army, took out Reeboks myself
45. in my khakis gotta watch my health
I'm so hard nigga, Glock 17 quick draw nigga
Like the old me, 17, sippin malt liquor
All black khaki suit, all black Converse
Nigga Imma keep on stomping coming Straight Outta
