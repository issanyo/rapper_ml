[Verse 1: Dresta]
It ain't nothin' like days when a nigga can roll
Either slidin' on Dubs or rollin Daytons and fo's
Livin' that life because you only live once
So whip out your trunk on some Compton funk
The weather is hot and the hoes is hot
And they ridin' your jock because you clockin' a knot
You can be the ugliest homie in the gang
But your all in the game if your rollin' in thangs
'Cause girls don't care about how a nigga strivin'
All they wanna see is what you drivin', so they can get a ride in
And nobody knows
Why the nigga with the flyest lo-lo got the ugliest hoes
Why the next man, pullin' all the good bags
Niggas like you rather roll with the hoodrats
The pool party on and it's crackin'
Niggas rappin' but ain't no cappin' or scrappin'
And girlies also listenin' and crack
G street stuffed all between the backs, ha
It feels good another neighborhood function
Why ain't no riftin', set trippin' or nothin'
Niggas straight hangin' ten
Tryin' to pull some skins till they competent, yeah
Gettin' high of the chocolate thai
Come on and jump inside so we can take a ride

[Hook x2]
Come on take a ride (take a ride)
On that westside (on that westide)
Come on take a ride (take a ride)
(come and take a ride on the wicked ass westside)

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Damn another day bright and sunny as the last one
Time for the Dresta to start pullin' fast ones
See a girl in a Hyundai, I know her
Pull up to the driver side, spray her with my Super Soaker
Look at how hot it be, no animosity, that's how it got to be
Just fun and games and it's cool for kids to act the fool
For they back to school
Now they skippin' they mornin' cartoons
They'd rather be outside throwin' water balloons
And ain't nobody tryin' to act hard
Got my homie Big Mike barbecuing in the backyard
Baby locs, shootin' jokes like the hood jerk
Damn a barbecue brings the niggas out the woodwork
Cause I ain't seen you in while G
But to the homies so let's go get some indo and Old E
And shoot the B's 'bout the old ways
When we was bad little niggas runnin' round in the old days
Tryin' to prove who was boss and who was soft
Even though I got tough ain't no love loss

[Hook x2]
Come on take a ride (take a ride)
On that westside (on that westide)
Come on take a ride (take a ride)
(come and take a ride on the wicked ass westside)

[Chorus: Dresta]
Take a ride, take a ride, take a ride
(come and take a ride on the wicked ass westside)
Take a ride, take a ride
Take a ride with me, take a ride
(come and take a ride on the wicked ass westside)

[Verse 3: Dresta]
Pump up the tires, wipe of the wires
Tighten up the battery cables with the pliers
Check the gates, now I'm straight
Bumpin' that Menace II Society by MC Eiht
See I got spice, but I'm not the one
My trigger gots no heart, so you gots to run
The homies caravan kinda deep down the street
Lo-lo's and jeeps 'bout to fly to the beach
Niggas causin' havoc, stirin' up static
Blockin' off traffic to let homies pass it
Niggas get stupid, drive crazy
So my homies faded the funk
Now it's on the toe, hey yo
We can roll to the beach when its dark
I heard the individuals is throwin' somethin' up at the park
My homie Black gotta Coupe but he need a
Little help cause the nigga gotta chrome hotter than a

[Hook x2]
Come on take a ride (take a ride)
On that westside (on that westide)
Come on take a ride (take a ride)
(come and take a ride on the wicked ass westside)

[Outro: Dresta]
Yeah; Outburst is in the house
Def Jam is in the house
Take a motherfuckin' ride with me
Take a motherfuckin' ride through the westside
A motherfuckin' ride, ride, yeah
(come and take a ride on the wicked ass westside)
A motherfuckin' ride, ride, yeah
A motherfuckin' ride, ride, yeah
