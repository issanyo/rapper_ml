[Intro: Dresta]
This how it's going down
Yeah, hehehe
This is my motherfucking dedication
From the gangsta
So all you bustas better take cover
Cause I'mma drop some shit on this one... fool

[Verse 1: Dresta]
Another day another dollar
So holler if you hear a motherfucker
D-R to the E, I'm on a mission with my brother
Down for whatever so don't ever play me close
Ain't no other motherfucker on the East or the West Coast
Ever so clear making noise
My diary's sincere and I'm down with the Geto Boys
So, so, a nigga better check me
And reevaluate, yo, step 'fore yo neck hit the deck
I check, I bust every day that I'm alive
I'll keep checking marks till the day that I die
So why, should another brother try to confess?
When a nigga from the west, fresh outta Y-T-S
Ah yes, you just didn't know what was crackin'
Thought I wasn't strappin' cause you heard me rapping
But trick, I only do this shit for you suckers
Got me clocking clusters talking about you busters

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out (Dresta)]
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(You marks can't fuck with the nigga named Dre)
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(You busters can't fuck with the nigga named Dre)
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
The Pound can't fuck with the nigga named Dre
(Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day)
You suckers can't fuck with the nigga named Dre

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Now busta, it's D-R-E keep it coming on
Love it when I shove it ruggish the thugish bone
I only represent the real
And even though I got a record deal
I'm a real nigga still
My homies love that and would
Know I'm a real nigga from the streets
Weren't no studios in the hood
Cause, what the fuck you telling (you're guilty)
Well lock me back up so I can chill with Jayo Felony
Give me a cell with Snoop Doggy Dogg
So I can rub my dick off between that bitch sugar walls
Niggas must think I'm struggling
But fool I got 10 points and own my damn publishing
So who the fuck should I fear?
I've been out for 2 years and got blasted but I'm still here
And now yo' people stand in tears
Because they heard about Compton giving head to my peers

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out (Dresta)]
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(You marks can't fuck with the nigga named Dre)
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(You busters can't fuck with the nigga named Dre)
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
The Pound can't fuck with the nigga named Dre
(Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day)
You suckers can't fuck with the nigga named Dre

[Verse 3: Dresta]
So now, as we approach up the ass end
Nigga give yo setup and keep yo shit blasting
Till it's fucking with yo' eardrum
I never worry bout the next man cause Nutty never feared nothing
So now it's simple and it's plain
And I wanna dedicate this to my nigga DJ Train
I feel yo' presence in this room
And if ya see my cousin Gugulo tell my niggas that I'll see him soon
A nigga then blew out like a rock house
'95 Now it's all about me and the Knocc Out
So watch out cause we dropping shit like a stork
Keep shit popping from Compton to New York, nigga

[Hook: B.G. Knocc Out (Dresta)]
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(You marks can't fuck with the nigga named Dre)
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(You busters can't fuck with the nigga named Dre)
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
The Pound can't fuck with the nigga named Dre
(Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day)
You suckers can't fuck with the nigga named Dre

[Outro: B.G. Knocc Out (Dresta)]
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(That's how it's going down with the nigga named Dre)
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(When I roll through your town it's the nigga named Dre)
Nigga, it's Compton everyday all day
(And niggas can't fade B.G. Knocc Out and Dre)
