[Intro: Dresta]
*laughing*
Yeah, you niggas ain't knowin'
*laughing*
B.G. Knocc Out on a motherfuckin' mission
*laughing*
Puttin' marks in check
Cause bustas get no respect
*laughing*
Yeah, it's the big bad west side, mad ass Compton

[Verse 1: B.G. Knocc Out]
Early afternoon as I starts my day
With a fat ass jay and a bottle of Alizé
Dips to the turf and as I roll up the block
I see my niggas in the cut with they Glocks cocked
Back, ready to peel a nigga's cap
Cause in the wicked west side it's on like that
I got to watch my back, cause niggas know my face
So I packs a 9-double-m just to stay safe
When I'm rollin' or just dippin' through traffic
A sucker stare me down I'mma let his ass have it
With the automatic
And keep dippin' lane to lane, as I throw up the N for the west side gang
Nigga, it ain't no future and you frontin' or you fakin'
And youngstas like me ain't givin' up nothin'
So, until you motherfuckers recognize
This is big bad west side, nigga, do or die

[Hook: La Tee (Dresta)]
Never will I run, never will I hide
(This is big bad west side, nigga, do or die)

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Steady bangin', steady slangin', steady hangin'
With my niggas still maintainin'
Like a loc inhaling doja smoke
And as long as I keep jackin' I'mma never go broke
I fall shorter than a midget with no knees
While all these marc niggas rollin' around on D's
Please, I gots to get my man
Anyway I can with this gat in my hand
I could come up with the master plan
Blast a man if he don’t cooperate now
Draw the gat to his head, tell him to lay face down
On the ground and don’t make a move
Cause you’ve already taken a loss and if you do you really lose
Out on your life, your kids and wife
So be a smart man and come about the knives
If you do then I let you stay alive
But if you don’t then I guess you gotta die

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
I got a call from my nigga sayin' the homie went down (damn)
He got caught slippin' by some niggas from the town
Now he’s in M-L-K in critical condition
Fuck that I got to go on a mission for my nigga
Cause I know he do it for me
Now I’m waitin' for the little homies
To come back with the G ride
And take a trip to the east side
Catch a clown slippin' and open fire on his black ass
And blast on ‘em all night, cause I believe in the theory
‘Take a life for a life’, yeah
Now my homie ain’t the only one who fell
Cause I know for sure I sent one down to hell
Nigga, and I’m still tryin' to earn some stripes
So you best not get caught slippin' cause it’s on, on sight
Two funerals in one week, so now I gots to suit up
One I’m rollin' a ten and the other I’m gonna shoot up
Say what’cha gonna do what to B.G
Right about now, yo, I don’t think you wanna see me
Because it wouldn’t be a happy scene
All you see is me unload the whole seventeen
Rounds, dead up in your chest
That’s what you get for runnin' up without a bullet proof vest, sucker
Before I die I’m gonna take at least five
Cause when you’re from the N-U-T-T-Y
It's do or die

[Hook x4]

[Outro]
This is big bad west side, nigga, do or die (x3)
