[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I love you mama but it's just one of them thangs
Yeah, it's just one of them thangs
It's just one of them thangs

[Verse 1]
I've been going through a whole lot lately
I know you're upset but just cool out baby
I'm trying to explain that I never meant to hurt you
I'm knowing you what you're thinking, then how can I desert you?
Never did deserve you - look girl I heard you
I'm telling you what happened, mama, patience is a virtue
Give me a minute, I'ma tell you, don't worry, I respect you
That's why you need to hear the whole story, the whole story
Started 'bout a month ago, I was at the strip bar
Getting me a lap dance, my dick started to get hard
Baby started to rub it, I started to love it
She slid me her phone number, thought nothing of it
Never even call the phone number at all
Three weeks ago we run into each other at mall
And she remembered me clearly
I'm trying to tell you how it happened sincerely, baby
It's just one of them thangs

[Break]
Yeah, it's just one of them thangs
I never meant to leave you out of my brain, it's one of them thangs
Yeah, it's just one them thangs
Yeah, just one of those thangs

[Verse 2]
See, she was sitting in the food court
Waiting on her friend to come, looking all sexy
Eating on a Cinnabon, she called out, "Dresta"
Turned then I faced her, "damn you look familiar"
But still couldn't place her, looked at her closely
Walked up slowly, she said
"Oh so you gon' act like you don't know me? You never did call"
I was like, "Oh, no, lil' mama, it ain't like that at all
Look, I got a girl and I been tryna do right"
She said, "That's cool, I ain't tripping, can I see you tonight?"
I'm like, "Damn, you're so fine, it's hard to resist
I guess it had to be a reason for us meeting like this"
So I hooked up with her, looked up hit her
She brought a friend and then let me and her split her
Now I can't forget her, got her glowing like glitter
I never meant to make you bitter, it's just one of them thangs
I got hooked, couldn't leave it alone
That's why you came home from work and all my clothes was gone
But I came back to tell you 'cause I know I was wrong
Every time I saw your number couldn't answer my phone
After I wrote my third letter, I told myself, sat her
Down, I'm here now 'cause you deserve better
I left you for somebody else and I ain't proud of it
The pussy got me trapped, I can't find my way out of it
I-, I been-, I been-, I been-
I been sprung since the day I got with her
I guess I'm like T-Pain, in love with a stripper
I must confess you looking good in that dress
Want you to know I truly miss you and I wish you the best
Don't cry... don't cry? Mama, don't cry
I'm feeling bad enough as it is
And I promise you I'm still here for you and the kids
Stand tall, I never meant to hurt none of y'all
And if you need me baby give me a call
It's just one of those thangs
It's just one of those thangs
I never meant to cause you no pain, it's one of those thangs
