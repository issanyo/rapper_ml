[Verse 1: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well it's 95 and I'm back on the scene
Now everybody wanna be on a niggas team
I blew up out the clear, kicking flavor in your ear
Rocking shows, knocking hoes, screaming (party over here!)
But behind the scenes ain't all what it seems
Motherfuckers run schemes when it comes to the greens
So by any means I got to do what is necessary if I wanna become
Legendary in this game, my name is the B.G
K-N-O-double-C O-U-T, nigga still down with Eazy
But now I'm wit my big bro, bouncing in my 6-fo'
Thought we was put in the twist but ya didn't know
That I was clocking
And bitches still jocking the baby gangster from Compton
'Cause they know it's on and popping
Nigga this is for you blind fools who
Filling pockets and groove, fuck you and yo' jealousy
'Cause niggas always talking the shit about me rapping
Talk behind my back but don't really know what's happening
Popping at the lips but ain't really saying nothing
Mad 'cause I got up, got out, got something

[Chorus x2: Mo]
Jealousy- why all these people keep on sweating me
Yeah yeah

[Pre-verse talking: Dresta]
Yeah, so it feels good
So let me live my life, uh-huh

[Verse 2: Dresta]
I'm damned if do, I'm damned if don't
No I don't got a lot what I got niggas want
That's the problem in the hood, it's a bitch
Niggas can't see another nigga having shit
I wanna get rich and have some chips to help my man out
But niggas say I'm tripping 'cause I don't be giving handouts
Nigga you'se a grown man you better learn some hustling
But you wanna hold hands and walk through the struggling
Now nigga please, money didn't never grow on trees
If it did you'd see the D-R-E raking leaves
So wake up, that shit is just a dream and you're tripping
That's why I keep my heat on the seat when I'm dipping
Cause brothers like you and the rest of them fools
Be plotting on my crew now you're dropping by twos
I hit the Hennessy and I see you strictly as the enemy
(But Dre that was the homey), well fool better him then me
Niggas always talking that shit about me rapping
Talk behind my back but don't really know what's happening
Popping at the lips but ain't really saying nothing
Mad 'cause I got up, got out, got something

[Chorus x2: Mo]
Jealousy- why all these people keep on sweating me
Yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Dresta]
See look the homies don't be realizing real shit like this
Been broke all my life ain't nobody gave me shit
Working like a motherfucker blood sweat and tears
Never heard from my peers when I served all them years
But no love was lost when you was out rolling big time
Now I wish you player hating niggas would let me get mine
Gossip like a bitch but that bullshit is old style
Nigga I ain't got [?] but a low profile

[Verse 4: B.G. Knocc Out & Dresta]
Ain't a nigga like the K.O? I rolls a 5 point 0
Occasionally I go dipping in the lo-lo
I know it's a trip and niggas can't understand it
How a nigga rolling when I used to be stranded
Damn it feels good to be a hustler
Now it's time to separate the locs from the busters
I gotta maintain because games I don't play none
That's one thing I won't do (what's that?) forget where I came from
'Cause niggas always talking that shit about me rapping
Talk behind my back but don't really know what's happening
Popping at the lips but ain't really saying nothing
Mad 'cause I got up, got out, got something

[Chorus x4: Mo]
Jealousy- why all these people keep on sweating me
Yeah yeah

[Outro: Mo]
Jealousy, yeah
