[Verse 1: Dresta]
I hate niggas that floss like they boss then their ass gets toss'
Gotta talkin' as a loss cause they soft
Talkin' that shit like they dogs in hogs and got balls
But in high school was taggin' on walls
Now they got c rag, he sag, he brag
Bout to ??tase?? niggas so get your punk ass some knee pads
Roll on Dre's dick, now he fucking you bitch
You better make you a switch
??He be?? jackin the tricks
Now you fucked the game up, hardcore rap singer
Wannabe a BG 93 gangbanger
Twenty years late
Now you bangin' on tapes
Niggas whooppin' that shit
But don't be bustin' a grape
Snoop whooppin' this whoopin' that
I'm a G shit, you mark ass nigga ain't nothing but a bitch
Interior gangsta, interior ho
Adds Dre's gangsta flow to let ya know
Marks gets no respect

[Hook]
This time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
This time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
Marks gets no respect

[Verse 2: Dresta]
I'm real as they come
Niggas run
When I come cuz i pack guns
Hoes they'be respect when i come
Some try to test but now they lay to rest
Tryna mess with the layest wicked set from the west
Side i will ride with my homies and get my cap on
Let me strap on the ?brownies? and we can get a scrap on
Pop you up, then i lay my rag on your trick ass
Disrespect yourself and get my nut to your bitch ass
Cause the dresta don't be givin' a fuck
I've be livin' it up
Bump it harder and i'll see you givin' it up
The end to the end of the road
But nigga unload and let' this 9 explode(blah blah)
Catch me if you can I'm a man and I stand strong
[?] I never planned to live long
The pimp to his [?] gotta represent, compton
165 percent. Marks get no respect!

[Hook]
This time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers

[Break: B.G Knocc Out]
Yea this B.G. Knocc Out nigga
I used to see you up there in Long Beach enjoin' dancing uh
Now in '93 you a G, Snoop I'ma let you know
You still a mark to me nigga. Yo Dre kick it

[Verse 3: Dresta]
You gets no respect if you a busta, a mark, a trick, a punk, a mark
Bitch type nigga dirty mac into some action just simple as a busta
From my home trick trap slut
But it's a shame to use another man's name
To a ??blip?? you eat game
You just a simple ass buster
Motherfucker I'm disgusted
Your bitch ass can't be trusted
Cause only a bitch will tell a bitch some shit like that
I wanna get my gat
And just blast your mark ass
For tryna dirty mac me, the black BG
Nigga never scared to pull the trigga
Yourself you check
Before i break your neck
Motherfucker you a busta
And you gets no respect
