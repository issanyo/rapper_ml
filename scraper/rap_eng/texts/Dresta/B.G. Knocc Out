Draw my gat to his gum an say surprise nigga (nigga)
Pull back the trigger (trigger)

Now that's really something, but that's how it goes in the city of Compton
Niggas don't play, suckas dropping dead every day
Runnin out as you's catching the blues from my AK
Mark got me fed up, got wet up, now he's put to rest
When the shots rang he tried to drop but caught one in the chest
Bum, bum, bum now he's doomed cuz he misbehaved
When he gets buried I'mma piss all over his grave, Nigga

Hey! That nigga ya best of back up and strap yo bag up

Can catch a slug but one lay in mud every weekday
From a pop to they skull's top proper
Body shot pop, body shot pop, then he drops
On the scene best of rush that nigga to killa king
Or make obituaries and find somebody who could sing
A sad song dropping tears that never last long
Then take it home get yo grub on and slap bones
Round up the straps for this mission as a must
And watch all the bustas who ain't with it get they last run
I down a 5th and pour out a sip
As I drip and I trip 'bout my homie who is now RIP
Nutty by nature I'll hate to make ya, break ya neck
Trying to keep from gettin' wet
Che check that dome 'for you make it home crack it skull bone
Before that bell goes ding dong yo ass is gone

Cuz if a nigga flex watch my tech he can spit and rip the flesh of your fuckin' chest
Test skill left will when I will appeal with my steel
Because I ain't afraid to die and I'm ready to kill
Watch a nigga's blood spill on the muthaphukkin' ground
As I dump every round and buck his ass down
To the muthaphukkin' turf putting work like I'm suppose to
I taps my strap in my hand muthaphukka housta
Zaggin', blue raggin' doing murders in my mask and
???, start blastin'
187 in the first degree, thre ain't no OG or BG that's worst than me
A mac ass L-O-C with the homicidal tendency
Nutty Nutty dumping bloody bodies up in the sea
A perfect figure of a Nutty young nigga
Giving it up to the bullets cuz I'm living by the trigger nigga
