[Intro: Bg Knocc Out]

Ha-ha
It's going down baby
Executive Entertainment
Rearranging shit
Big jess
My nigga out there, Chris
My producer Chris
Head out nigga
Ha-Ha

[Verse 1: Bg Knocc Out]

Stepped out dressed in all black
With a fat sack to make a killing
Player haters step back strap with a gat like Matt Dillon
I roll with cap peelers and niggas that stack millions
We all on point
Motherfuckers harm civilians
And kill when, motherfuckers try to stop mine
Cut him up with steak knifes
Put his head on the stop sign
45's and Glock nine's, miniture AK-47's
Nigga, you better hope that there's a ghetto up in heaven
And while you gone
A nigga like me chillin up at your spot
With your bitch
Straight up getting head, booty and cock
It don't stop
Baby gangsta knock knock from the block
On patrol, with the Calico 100
Stocked up and rocked at your moms crib
You ain't know? Motherfucker that's how I live
Cos something's gotta give in this cold world
They say you weak what you saw
But I was taught, if you can't beat them
You best finish to

[Chorus x2]
Roll with me, through the streets of vietnam
So you can see, exactly where i'm coming from
The media gon' show you what they want you to see
Why hear it from them, when you can hear it from me?

[Verse 2 :  Gangsta Dresta]
I know one day i'll probably bust from this street shit
I only trust this heat, I eat shit and sleep with
This street life will get you caught up in some deep shit
It's money, murder, sex and violence ain't no secrets
I've watch the media destroy so much of what we got
When none of you bitches really know who shot Big and Pac
They say my nigga died of aids but believe me
I know fo 'sho that didn't no pussy killed Eazy
10 kids and not one with a speck of none
It was all a plot, the shot was dropped from the top guns
We know they keep it on they dillo (down low), me and E know
I refuse to keep silent, killed my violent hero
Now you're headed for the master and I got no limits
Until i'm finished, yo I know you wanna destroy my image
But I pray that the lord replenish my soul
And for every breathing  demon, I pray that your head rolls

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3: Cuicide]
My whole life been a journey, waking up
The next day hoping my family(?) don't burn me
My ma and pops never been around
And I wouldn't shed a tear if I seen somebody pop 'em down
Cause they ain't know what I went through
Chose dope over me, your whole mind must be sick fool
You left a child that's gon' be something
So when you see me on TV don't come to me when you need something
Because ain't no way that i'ma help you
And advice to vote for ya'll(?) don't expect for me to come through
To me you had me on an accident, if you hadn't been smoking on that night
You wouldn't of had me trick, so my life took a downfall
Dont give a damn about what the media say
Because I clown y'all, because my life had to suffer
Throw your hands up if you will G, bounce your head if you feel me

[Chorus] x4
