[Intro]
Uh, yeah, uh, say what
We return
Compton, Cali
For the 9-9 (that's 2000)
Dresta Da Gangsta (Dresta)
Real as they come, bar none
Uh, say what

[Verse 1]
Let's take a quick trip back down memory lane
Follow me, as we journey on the yellow brick road to C-P-T
I see, what people think, gangstas suppose to be
Compton is where rap music learned to be a G
We had flow and everybody know
When these bitches were scared to cuss
And they were scared of us
They tried to test
But you knew that the wild wild west, wasn't scared to bust
It was all about originality
But the whole time the West Coast grind
Help me focus on the salary
It seems you eastern motherfuckers have forgot
I'm the same G that put Eazy-E back on the block
I'm real as they come
And I'm from the 1-0-1-4 South Orlean Block
Where the shit don't stop
And if your car don't hop
Then you gotta be on dubs, drop

[Hook] (x4)
We just givin' it up for Compton, California
It's such a lovely place
It's such a lovely place
We just givin' it up for Compton, California
And any time of year
You can find me here

[Verse 2]
Now I done been around the world, but I still don't see
What people talkin' about ain't shit like the C-P-T
I can float to the Bahamas, to escape all the drama
Got to come back, I miss my hoodrats and baby mamas
Smashin' on the 91, navi and a dime piece
Laid up at the Hamptons homes is where you'll find me
Jacuzzi and a camcorder, bootys and the bitch
Sometimes I like to freak dykes, in case I want to switch
Like it or not, Compton Cali back in the slot
Dresta Da Gangsta, crackling hot
You can't touch this
Let's put the C-P-T back on the map
Before I put my brownies back on the strap
I'd rather rap on the track
Since these bitches ain't seein' the light
Ruthless should have never been Tomica Wright's
Bitch, you ain't from Compton
When somebody see that ho, they need to tell her
To quit fuckin' the homie Ren, like Jerry Heller

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
For years I tried to let you know this
But the media didn't wanna let me show this
Realism I've survived of off instinct
And finally my life is startin' to feel in sync
I'm on the radio and Eazy made it possible
Dresta ain't wrong, homie, I'm only bein' logical
Studied my craft, did the math
Now I get the last laugh
No longer bang for gangs, now bang gangs for cash
Me and my dawg WC eventually bang in the room
My brother B.G. Knocc and this brother C-Toons
How can we lose
We paid our dues and made our moves
The only rappers around
Who don't got nothin' to prove
Most respected on all levels
From the club to the street, homie, y'all tell us
Is it real
I see you all makin' G's through the nation
But Compton laid the foundation

[Hook] (x2)
