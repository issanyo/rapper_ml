[Verse 1: Dresta]
Yeah, you know in '94 me and my bro hit your ass with a blast
Now we gotta hear this trash from this busta named Daz
(But Daz) ain't Nothin' but a mark who be buggin' out
Stop the monkey shit put my fist in your monkey mouth
So everybody swing with me
D-R-E, O-B-G from the C-P-T
It's on again so tell a friend, we got it poppin'
Me and B.G. Knocc Out swingin' back to Compton

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Yes, well I'm back on the block where the B.G.s chill
Where niggas like to get ill, but marks get killed
Feel the strength of a loc as I go for broke
Step right up and get smoked cause I ain't no joke
Wack MC's I knock them out the box like [?]
You can go kick ass or either get your ass kicked
Steady packin' my chrome and I'm known, for hoo bangin'
B.G. Knocc Out, I got clout and I'm Compton swingin'

[Hook: La Tee & Dresta]
Hey hey hey (Comptoooooooon Compton swingin)

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Giving up love to the hood, the city where I'm from
So when you come to Compton you better bring a big gun
Or run and hide from the 165, worldwide
Niggas that's straight do or die
Tagging out my set as I mob through your town
Crossing out the Dogg Pound cause I'ma haul ground
So don't trip, you might get your fuckin' lip split
Cause niggas from Compton don't play that shit
Still up on top and you know it don't stop
All bustas bow down or prepare to get dropped
By that nigga named Knocc as I rock your block
And I bet you never seen the B.G. calling shots
Down for my turf put in work in my days
Now I'm in the house, without a doubt tryin' to get paid
Laid back and relax with tracks to keep you bumpin'
Original baby gangsta and I'm swingin' back to Compton

[Hook: La Tee & Dresta]
Hey hey hey (Comptoooooooon Compton swingin)
All day every day Knocc Out and Dre
All day every day Knocc Out and Dre
Hey hey hey (Comptoooooooon Compton swingin)
All day every day Knocc Out and Dre
All day every day Knocc Out and Dre

[Verse 4: Dresta]
It ain't nothin' but the Compton G, D-R-E-S-T-A-ster
Nutty nigga Dresta giving girls the vapors
Take ya, second to relax your brain
I'm still the same, you know my name
I don't get caught up in fame
I do my thang, and hang with my homies non stop
Much props, to Compton and Watts, yeah
Sure shot (heeey) a body rock (heeey)
Mix Master Spade, used to rock my block
But now it's history, another mystery, of a legend
And I been checkin' mics since '87
Steady on these stripes on the streets with my speech
And keeps me a new chick to freak every week
So girls you can page me with a freakin' outburst
Or you can leave a message with my niggas up at outburst
You know I'll hit you back with a voice mail or something
And tell you meet me in the hood
I'm swingin' back to Compton

[Hook: La Tee & Dresta]
