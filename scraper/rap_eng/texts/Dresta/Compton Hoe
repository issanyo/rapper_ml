[Verse 1: Dresta]
I like big butts, but big tits drive me nuts
And heres another cut from the Compton slut
The Nutty nigga named Dresta, the westside gangsta
Comin' back with more skills, than the buffalo bills
I'm makin mo' deals, than a strawberry might
I'll lick your clit, if you suck my pipe
'Cause I ain't ashamed to get down on the ground
And swing you around like a merry-go-round
While I held your mouth
The freaks come out at night
But freaky Dre comes anytime of the day
That's what they say
'Cause I'm the horniest nigga in rap now
So lay your bare back down
And show me that crack now
Damn, girl you're a gift
And bitches on Soul Train still get my dick stiff
And I've been watchin' them hoes for a good minute
Shakin' that ass while I was wishin' I was in it
I'm all about bustin' nuts
And sexin' up the big girl's butts
Vanilla, brown or black ass can be
Don't matter 'cause a bitch is a bitch to me
So here bitch put your lips around my weiner
Bustin' hoes from Compton to Altadena
Have you seen her
Shake that ass with respect
I pump more rump shakers than Wreckx-n-Effect
How can a nigga say it right, let's see
I get more pussy than a dyke
I like different hoes
But I never get naked with a snake bitch
Only pull my clothes to my ankle, wanna stank hoe
'Cause I'm a real nigga from the Candy Block
And since I'm makin' ends, hoes wanna hand me cock
You think you got hoe'd to a rich brother
But don't know, I'm still broke than a motherfucker
But I'ma let ya think I got the riches
And keep runnin' up in you gold diggin' bitches
Get the dough then I hit the do'
To let the bitch know I'm the Compton hoe

[Hook x2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Bitch lay down, take off them clothes
Spread the thighs wide open for the Compton hoe

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Compton new and improved with a groove guaranteed to hit
And it's more funky than Bootsy, while he takin' a shit
'Cause I can do mo', than you will ever know
The neighborhood hoe, with the Compton flow
I'm never hesitant, when I represent my residence
Givin' it all I got, 165 percent
Hangin' out with my homies or my dogs everyday like
Party never stop, tick-tock til the day light
Kickin' it with my nigga B.G. Moy, that's my homeboy
Killin' for the gusto, never trust a hoe
Dresta's my name, original baby gangsta main
Rest in peace to Vamp, Crazy D and Wayne
Tick-tock non stop on the block and it's like that
Gotta give a shout to my homegirl Nick Nack
Tick tack toe, I got the dough but I want mo'
Even though you know I'm a bonafied hoe
See I gets the ends for the skins that I hit
I get to lick your slit to make you kickin' shit
I get you body hot with just one touch
And for you to freak your stuff, won't cost you much
Just 25 dollars an hour to make you holler
Another 10 dollars I'll eat your pussy in the shower
Come on and take your big booty for a ride
I'll cover my eyes and let you be the guide
'Cause ain't no limitations on the things we do
I'll let my tongue lick where you want me to
As long as you're kickin' indo I don't care so
Bitch take a flick with the Compton ho

[Hook x5: B.G. Knocc Out]
Bitch lay down, take off them clothes
Spread the thighs wide open for the Compton hoe

[Verse 3: Dresta]
Your pussy is the lake that my face be fishin' in
So lick this dick to any bitch that's listenin'
Catchin' more hoes than a target at a gun range
Bitches call me daddy Dre 'cause they know I run thangs
Go with the flow cause you know I'm a pro
At hustlin' a hoe outta all her dough
And I'm the type of nigga that never kick a grunyan
But I'm quick to use my bunions
To kick you in your onion
Hoes out of know I don't find shit funny
You can keep your honey
Bitch give me your money, yeah
'Cause being broke ain't no motherfuckin' joke
So give me a c-note for every stroke
Broke in the fully, yeah, money be the reason
I do it every season, gettin' paid while in skeezin'
Never had to buy clothes, bitches buy me wardrobes
Gotta keep a job bitch 'cause I don't fuck the poor hoes
Yes you can say I'm a modern-day gold digger, hoes figure
I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm a bold nigga
I'll tell it like it is, got to go with the flow
If you got the dough call up the Compton hoe, bitch

[Hook x6: B.G. Knocc Out]
Bitch lay down, take off them clothes
Spread the thighs wide open for the Compton hoe
