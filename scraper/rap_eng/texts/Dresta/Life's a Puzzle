[Chorus: L.V., La Tee]
Life in the hood, (life in the hood)
Life in the hood, (yeah, just like a puzzle)
Life in the hood, (life in, life in the hood)
Life in the hood, is just like a puzzle
The good die young

[Verse 1: Dresta]
It's like a jungle, sometimes when you rhyme
The hood took you under
Niggas start to wonder, why you missing all these summers
I ain't seen the streets in like 5 or 6 weeks
Cause I'm back on the cell block
Looking like I'm shell shocked
In and out, down south, up north
I'm back back, forth and forth
I can't seem to keep my black ass out of dough
Cause I'm steady doing dirt, put in work for the turf
I did a gang of killing, and still ain't learnt a damn thing
Except how to gang bang
Talk slang and shoot game
And now I think I'm the mack of the century
Cause I got this bitch running through the penitentiary
But never knowing she was hoeing in the hood, black
Til the day my homies say: "Dre that bitch a hoodrat"
But shoot the package on some nights and I'm alright
Just another piece of the puzzle of my fucked up life

[Chorus: L.V., La Tee]
Life in the hood is just like a puzzle (like a puzzle)
If in the game, your looking for trouble (looking for trouble)

[Verse 2: BG Knocc Out]
My life is like a puzzle
I thank god for everyday I'm seeing
Living in the world cause I'm bout European
Being, a young black male is like having on
Some gasoline underwear bailing through hell
Cause we have no win that we can all see
Ask Rodney King, Michael J and Mike T
And what about O.J., I think it's a set-up
Pac you said it first but my nigga keep your head up
They don't wanna see another black man make it
And everything we get that look nice, they wanna take it
So make it, 187 on the police
I'm tired of seeing niggers get stressed
And fucked with no grease
No peace, no justice, motherfuck this
Live BG's doing dirt out of cutless
The three strikes march, it didn't help the situation
All it did was increase the jail population

[Chorus: L.V., La Tee]

[Break: L.V.]
Life in the hood is just like a puzzle
Life in the hood is just like a puzzle

[Verse 3: Dresta]
My homies is a piece to my puzzle
I love they ass to death
But the more I look around, there ain't too many of us left
Survival of the fittest, and the strong don't survive
I can count more real niggas dead than alive
So niggas stop the talking, let that bullshit keep walking
I'm trying to get mine, so quit wasting my time
And if I had a dime for every time I met a bitch
That I thought was the shit, my ass would be rich
But no, I'm broke, and bitches ain't a joke
Nigga you better check yo bitch, talking shit
Will get that ho smoked, (I'm down with you baby)
Bitch, don't even make a nigga start
Trying to get inside my heart
So she can tear my life apart
I already got enough strain on my brain
Than to be busy worried about some busy ass dame
But game, recognize game with the Dresta
Fool, I thought you knew about the west side gangsta

[Chorus: L.V., La Tee]
