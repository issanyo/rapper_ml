[Intro: Yella]
Gangsta!

[Verse 1: Dresta]
A life time, a bad luck
It's sad but the nigga stayed strong
Pray everyday that my life goes on
Cause the streets ain't givin a black man shit
So my attitude is: you can suck a fat man's dick
Tricks in my face for my snaps, cause I'm rappin
I puts them in their place when I pulls up my strap and slap 'em
Backwards with the theory of my anger
Nigga's so crazy on the daily talkin strangers
Wanna hit the stick, I'm scared of the Bombay
Andre, never was a dope fiend anyway
I'd rather lay back in the cut, be corrupt, and fuck shit up
Because I'm stuck in the streets

[Hook: Michel'le w/ minor variations]
It's seems the streets, they just won't let me go
Sometimes I wish, I find some where to go

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Damn, it's a shame, I blame myself for my bad luck
A young buck nigga growin up, gave a mad fuck
I'm rollin through at night shit in papers
Give hoes the vapors and live in skyscrapers
But I guess I tried to move too fast
So the lord had to stop my black ass with a blast (*Gun Shot*)
One shot to my back, makin small tracks
Think of my life where am I tryin not to fall flat
As I swell, people yell, damn he hit Dre
My nigga Dale rushed me to M-L-K
Blankin out, but still thinkin 'bout survival
When a nigga didn't even have my post on the rival
I tell my mamma, yeah, I love you born to hug you not dug you
Being able to death from the cradle

[Hook: Michel'le w/ minor variations]

[Verse 3: Dresta]
Now as I lay half dead I cried
And wonder why I'mma gonna die
Well, how hard I tried to change and rearrange my plans to be a man
Divided we fall, united we stand
But the lord helped the nigga through this mess
Even though, I still got a 9 slug in my chest
But still the nigga can walk down Kimp
Even though my arm trims and I walk with a limb
But I'm blessed to be alive and well
Doin swell, not in jail
And damn sure not in hot hell
So next time you're comin down my row
If it sounds to flow
I'll be prepare to go, so y'all

[Hook: Michel'le w/ variations]

[Outro: Michel'le w/ variations]
I got to do some way
I got to do way
I gotta go
I'm searchin'
