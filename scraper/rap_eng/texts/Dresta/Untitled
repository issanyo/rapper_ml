[Dresta]
I just spoke with fat rat from cedars, natural born leaders
We so strong yet we let this cold world cheat us
Theyll never defeat us, understand that they need us
They use us a breeders put us as slaves, murder and beat us
Im telling my crips, telling my bloods all of my thugs
I write these lyrics and syllibles, all of my loves, whatever the [?]
Every thug layin deceased, if we can have peace in rap
We can have it in the streets
From big draws to ned,big wood to grim
From gangsta eric to bobo, big sin to slim
From lil greedy to t po, baby bone and ice
Baby lane the two black crips, san and dice
Big dee oh big bam damn bro i miss you
Now in your memory i make this official
For the homies that died, or won't see the streets alive
For the mamas that cried, i say you was crucified, we can work it out

(chorus)

[Six Million]
From my own nation, to a plantation
We the cotton picking [?], this ain't my occupation
I wana run but im scared theyll cut my right foot off
Run the underground, [?]
Martin Luther King had a dream that seem to came true
But things have gone to the extremes, death in the air
No more trauma sinner, mama ima [?], i'm no [?] sinner
Im praying for forgiveness, my tears is endless
I see the prophecy unfold, so ima witness
At times i feel like killing but maintain, consequence is strain on the brain
Locked up for life for a murder i committed
Come to find out he ain't even the one who did it
Bitches telling on the G's cause they got no balls
Nigga shoulda never been involved at all

(chorus)

(Dresta)
See i dont care what they feel i put the ghetto upon my shoulders
We building a dream team, blue, red and green soldiers
Taking the streets over, Young Hoggs and teks
Busters can move over, the real niggas is next
Big dre, real as it gets, for every hood and every set
Its nothing but hub love and respect, they ain't conqured us yet
Dear lord im praying never, from here to the towers
Give us the power to come together

(Six mill)
Rest in peace Joe Boy and Young Trey from the trees
Papa Ru and Lay Back from the FT's
Boss Hogg from NHP and Thog
And my nigga Tip Toe from the CMGB
Diamond and Nutty Boy from Black P Stones
West Side, FL, [?]
8Ball, Lil HD, Young Snoop and Rampoo
Mausberg and Lil Ru, I ain't forgot you

(Chorus)
