Weathermen.. president is in the building
Those who came for my life need to get in line
The suicide by cop sweater is on!

Fucked up out my mind, the gun in my belt
Faintest of voice yells out, 'enjoy your summer in hell'
Dead friends and family surround me where they found me
An apparent suicide, I had a bounty on my spirit
Higher than I ever been, overlookin my wake
A closed casket, cause I had took off the face
Cause I ain't never like nobody starin at me
I'm feelin sappy, made a few people sad, but more really happy
My crew standin there with shovels just grinning
When the sun drop and the clients stop it's back to the livin
Cause y'all ain't really think I'd go out like Kurt did you?
Beat GG Allin to the punch and do it at a venue
Hopped out the coffin like David Blaine
I hit y'all with a decade of verses, I guess for baby fame
You want a plug? Stick this underground shit so far up your ass you stutter
Now, keep lickin the cover
How the fuck did rap turn into Big and Pac karaoke
Back in the 80's they did shit but kept it very low key
I know I'm speakin to less than one percent of the public
But this is for the people that copped Movies and loved it
Ya'll better hope I don't catch AIDS or the big C
Cause the day they say I'm goin is in the week y'all comin with me
From the smallest of riffs to the biggest of beefs
I'mma be the first rap serial killer in the streets
I'm caught somewhere between a thug and intelligent
I bug off a elephant acid scrapped off the elephant
Along with the rest of the insect nation
Standin there with bloody arms like it's an hallucination
This could be the last you'll ever know of I
Cause my spirit and physical just can't coincide
Used to write patterns now they write for their selves
If you ain't into death, step back, when I'm lightin up L's
