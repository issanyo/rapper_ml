[Female Voice]
So I think , my dad is like, starting to trip out...
Like because of the age difference and all
I mean, I don't give a fuck but...
But whatever he was threatening to kick me out...

[Verse 1: Cage]
Picked you up late after school
All your friends think I'm uber cool
Beat down dudes that treat you cold
Not too tough to fuck up a seventeen year old
Your daddy asked me my age in front of you
Lied through my teeth and said I'm twenty two

Your little teenage hands
Your little teenage hands
Your little teenage hands
Your stupid little teenage hands

[Verse 2: Cage]
Line them up give em a gun cook their brain
Cut their hair down and make em look the same
Now you're in the business of shootin' Arabs
Two years ago you were truth or darin'
Kissin' on the neck and squeezin' the hand
Like the lungs in your chest tryin' to breathe in sand
Knife in your stomach and they shut the van door
So you can find out they got special plans for...

[Hook]
Your little teenage hands
Your little teenage hands
Your little teenage hands
Your stupid little teenage hands
