As we unlock the secrets to our universe. We have
Discovered that an all encompassing substance
Called Dark Matter threatens our very existence is
This mysterious energy the true source of evil?
And what small hope have we as black
Holes angrily devour our floating islands of light
Theory becomes reality and another cross lines
The cosmic roadside engulfed by something....
DARKER THAN BLACK
