I been in this game for years
It's made me rob dead people
With my hand on the jar I pledged evil
On a step by step booklet
For you to get, study this shit
If you just started fucking with wet
Number Uno: don't travel with more than 2 O's
Wifey on the rag, that's 2 bottles up her culo
Shit get hot, you don't want the pigs to eat her
Slip that bitch to safety and get that juice in the freezer
Number 2: test the leak out on your crew, don't die to do it
Feel it in one puff? Cut that shit with lighter fluid
Keep the heat in reach but act casual
Dustheads act all violent and irrational
Number 3: don't trust no phencyclidine
That's the rogue agent in death
That's out to get your team
Formaldehyde ain't really got pcp in it
Copping yellow shit, somebody could've peed in it
Number 4: this don't really fly no more
Cause dudes don't get high on they own supply
Number 5: Never sell shit out the house
You'd be surprised the smell of clientele from one liquid ounce
Number 6: the cash, no sherm man fuck credit
Than bitch slap him for asking
To demonstrate your work ethic
7: come up with names like lethal weapon
Throw a stamp on the envelope that's only a suggestion
Get your weight up filling up caskets
Keep that shit in glass cause I've seen it eat right through plastic
Number 8: keep some cigarettes with you
Those cats who puff for free
Can hold dips too
Number 9 Should've been number 1 to me
Don't get caught
If you do don't talk to police
If cats think you're snitching
They might come through your kitchen
And cut your bitch into little pieces and go fishing
Number 10: read this shit again when you're way sober
If you ain't write it down or print it out then play it over
Follow these rules in no time you'll do it
Stupid motherfuckers be puffing embalming fluid
Check
Rule number 3 is see I'm stating facts
Leak carry the same charge as pumping H and Crack
I know chicks that get wet just for a drag of wet
Imagine what these hoes will do for a whole bag of death
Some nice tits to fumble could catch you on a humble
Fuck around and lose a whole bundle
Beads in the bottle are your starter kicks
I gotta go I got another jar to mix
