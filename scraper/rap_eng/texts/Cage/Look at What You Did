I enter the building through the side door, not like an eyesore
Lined up then slaughtered, nothing to die for
Slide past the bar, get through the alcoholics
No gold chain, it’s a dookie rope made of garlic
Bloodsuckers looking at me stuck with mice
I got the blood of Christ on a cup of ice
She took my eyes and she put em on her somehow
Now I understand why she gets up after sundown

Look at what you did, you don’t even see what you did
Won’t even look at yourself cause you think everyone is
A reflection of a vampire
Sleep like a vampire
Creep like a vampire
Speak like a vampire

Look at what you did, you don’t even see what you did
Won’t even look at yourself cause you think everyone is
A reflection of a vampire
Sleep like a vampire
Creep like a vampire
Freak, you are a vampire

Soul’s already black and burnt to a crisp but they wear it right
So much in fact that my lips smack with a parasite
Tongues touch, feels like a gun bust
Hit you in the stomach now you’re feelin what love does
But when your lung’s crushed
Cause you’ve been lied to and humiliated
Facilitated, manipulated, it’s so indicative
Of a weaker psyche might be, they feed nightly
Whoopee, two holes in my neck cause you like me? Bite me

Look at what you did, you don’t even see what you did
Won’t even look at yourself cause you think everyone is
A reflection of a vampire
Sleep like a vampire
Creep like a vampire
Speak like a vampire

Look at what you did, you don’t even see what you did
Won’t even look at yourself cause you think everyone is
A reflection of a vampire
Sleep like a vampire
Creep like a vampire
Freak, you are a vampire

Creature of elusiveness, nightlife exclusive fix
Tourniquets of velvet ropes, my four-finger crucifix
I’m pale with a sa-tan from Hell, groomed well
She tried to lift the CC pin from my lapel
Her fingernails longer than her dress is
She bit into my neck, snapped my necklace
And sunk her teeth into breakfast
She licked her lips and said, “I had a really fun night.”
Before she jumped in a cab she said, “Get home before sunlight.”

Look at what you did, you don’t even see what you did
Won’t even look at yourself cause you think everyone is
A reflection of a vampire
Sleep like a vampire
Creep like a vampire
Freak, you are a vampire
