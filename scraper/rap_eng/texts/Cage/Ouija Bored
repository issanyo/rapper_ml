[Intro]
S-A
Stop moving it
Im not moving it
S-A-M
Sam
You're moving it
I'm not moving it

[Verse 1- Sam Hill]
Awww, look who's playin' on the Ouija board
Think you’re conjuring lonely spirits on weed you’re bored
Became a conduit
Screamed at as I peed the floor
Look at the mirror
He said "Sorry dog, I need your door"
I wasn't able to stop it before it did harm
Hence the paragraphs I cut into my own arms
Started reading
I knew they would hate to hear it
Don't walk up like you heard the flock
I'll pray to ancient spirits
When you summon your run in with gauntlet aptitude
Apostles or a zombie after you
Like your sage you can negate the spell
Maybe raise up from the dead
Open the gates of hell
The gates of death
The shallow will escape the depth
Eat woman alive if she hates my breath
She blew a whistle like a ref
The wolves were on her flesh
Pulled out the switch blade and sliced off her breast
Cuz I'm horribly ghoulish
Torture is not the coolest
All hail Sam you love
While reversing what God say
Raped by a wraith
She thought it was cosplay

[Chorus]
We worship blood thirsty gods
And their mouths will be quenched
You provide the entertainment with your death and stench

[Verse 2]
All hail, Barnes and Noble Satan
Called upon by a church of Lavey fans
Saint Samuel won't save them
Pedals of a flower
Pedos in a play pen
Adversary
Burnin' down your Monastery
Hanging priests by the rosaries to honor Mary
More than words
We let this instrumental carry
Your casket into the fuckin' cemetery
Dismembered you from spine to jaw
As morticians put you together like a dinosaur
Intellectually a savage in these tribal ages
Tearin' out bitches vaginas like bible pages
And dimensions fold like origami
She made a pact high on Molly
I had her blood on my wall e
He said "Did you kill my Mommy?"
The cross roads are upon me
The violin munami
Leviathan or Tsunami [?]
