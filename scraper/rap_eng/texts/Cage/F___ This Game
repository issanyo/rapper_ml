You knew this was supposed to be this way

[Verse 1]
Fuck this game
I ain't numb enough to try to sustain
Got an abscess but the pus to drain
That little blood sucker had enough of this vein
Shit scholar was a fail of course
Anyone aboard drugs I would endorse
Lunatic at night, I don't sleep till day
If you see my ass, the moon must be over L.A
My only trusted friend
Blew away in a gust of wind
Now I feel like I'm on dust again
It's hard to keep in touch when you're out of this world
Shades still on, I didn't fall in the abyss
Even though you try to push me in you bitch
Get walked on like you're scared to stand
Sayin' I can't when I Ameri-can
What a bore
Does it feel good to score?
Only thing no one was not doing anymore
Things that you don't read in the brochure
How much L.S.D. can I procure?
Let you go
Like [?]
What's the antichrist think of holidays though?
All the outdoor I endure for dying brain cells I ignore

[Hook]
I don't give a fuck about you [x3]
I can't wait to live without you
I don't give a fuck about you [x3]
Why'd I write this song about you?

[Verse 2]
Digging like a dog for my soul again
Dirt under my nails what a hole I'm in
Didn't even really mean to trouble you friend
I have nothing up my sleeves but my WM
Wish I could have ran into a new savior
Put a lot of living give you euthanasia
Took his last breath and he let out no air
Then he went to the place that I'm going nowhere
Know that dream is fake but is the battery real?
How do we unplug each other now that we kneel
Stand up and get ratted on by your own friends
Pointing out all your losses because they got no wins
No way no how
Am I coming down what I fucking know now
Soon to overdose and be what you became
Thinking you relate to me to feel that pain
Real insane, no pieces fit
When you put it all together it's a piece of shit
The beast is near he's gonna eat you bitch
Down the road and not across the street, you kids
Feel that world closing in
Or you go beyond where you supposed to end
I see through you like I see through air
If I don't see you here I won't see you there

[Hook]
I don't give a fuck about you [x3]
I can't wait to live without you
I don't give a fuck about you [x3]
Why'd I write this song about you?

This is how the shit's supposed to be
You're right where you're supposed to be [x5]
