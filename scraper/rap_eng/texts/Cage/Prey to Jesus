[Intro]
Bow to the king...

[Chorus] x4
I was prey praying to the beast the beast

[Verse 1]
I was in a hotel lookin' through a lobby
I was in a hotel cuttin' up a body
She was in a hotel lookin' for a Johnny
She was in a hotel lickin' on a lolli...

[Chorus] x4
I was prey praying to the beast the beast

[Verse 2]
Flippin' through demonic text starvin' like Ghandi
Boss acolytes are only in it to be godly
Put the gun to his head and said to him calmly
Repeat the words from the book like you're a zombie...

[Verse 3]
Fix stash to your forehead just step fast
Change your shit you believe with whiplash
Pink cocaine stain from blood lookin' for coco
Dope fiend shot up a Mosque workin' for po-po
Only outsiders were fortuitous coked up
He could see inside you like you fuckin' a GoPro
Chemicals and flesh in a bath tub makin' gelatin
After sledge hammerin' your bitch ass skeleton...
Bury the parts I can't break up
And satanic rites until the dead wake up

[Chorus] x4
I was prey praying to the beast the beast
