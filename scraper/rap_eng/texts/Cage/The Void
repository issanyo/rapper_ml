[Intro: Sherry St. Germain]
All the people walking by, looking for a reason
Watching from a perfect line, pledging their allegiance

Marching in perfect time (8x)

[Chrous: Sherry St. Germain]
All we are is all we need
All we have is you and me
You and me
You and me

[Verse 1: Cage Kennylz]
It's like the ground opened up and Satan placed you in my arms
This isn't cattle mutilation or space ships on farms
This is at the depths of hell with the known K and beyond
This is 5 AM a livin' sacrifice before dawn
Because princess TNA got DNA on her tiara
You better hang on to that shit today it's gone tomorrow
I hope you grip on to your dreams until they squish between your fingers
And go away, like dreams no one remembers
When your in pain time limps along ticking you off
And both hands on the clock are indeed flicking you off
When you met me you wired to toy with two
I was gaspin', no slippin' and entered the void with you

[Chrous: Sherry St. Germain]

[Verse 2: Cage Kennylz]
I think you should bitch shit and whine some more
I opened the fucking lion's door
In and out of Barney's like I'm fucking a purple dinosaur
Allow me to redefine some more
If you don't get it then stow away
Until your dude and you can get off and go away
Lookin' for death at home's a lot like doin' meth alone
She's fake hot, pseudo-dope like Methadone
Why should I try to be selfless, cause you're bleeding helpless
I caught you and threw you back, so you can't say I'm selfish
The universe is ignoring me fuck an apology
I'll eat a pill if I want ecstasy, honestly
If I brought any of your dream's to life
I'm gonna kill those motherfuckers before you sleep tonight (bitch)
