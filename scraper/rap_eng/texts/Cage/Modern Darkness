[Music: Dave Garcia]

Just why does it rise up once again
Just what message does it send
You see malevolance is real
The two sides of all you feel
Are you the evil are you bad
Seeking the answers drives you mad
I know you're coming you're so near

I believe in you
I believe in you
I do

Do thing just happen randomly
Or do the forces make them be
You need to find which side you are on
Embrace the darkness and you're gone

I believe in you
I believe in you
You'll see

In mordern darkness that's where you thrive
There is no question you are alive
I cannot hear you
I cannot see
You're still around me you'll always be

When I get angry or I get scared
You try to take hold and grab your share
That's what you live for that's what you do
You move so quickly I never knew

Just look around you and you'll see
Death and destruction constantly
If there's a God why don't you hear
The cries of anguish loud and clear

I believe in you
I believe in you
I do
