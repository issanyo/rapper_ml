[Music: Eric Horton]

You say you'd see me on my way
I look at you I guess I should have known
I'm watching for you my friend
If I see you once again I'll scream
A tragedy you've come undone
Got nowhere for you to run
You're crying out it's all in vain
Somethings never seem to change because...

He's got the Devil inside
Look at the Angel's eyes
Looking to sacrafice the sanctity of life
The sanctity of life

Your victims pile alarming rates
You've gone this far you don't hesitate
You know it's time to lay it down
Not too late to turn it around
You know...

He's got the Devil inside
Look at the Angel's eyes
Looking to sacrafice the sanctity of life
The sanctity of life

You're shifting points of view an influence alive
Something's coming over you changing you inside

End of the line has come at last
You knew it would but not this fast
You've gone to far you've crossed the line
Save yourself seek the divine

He's got The Devil inside
Look at the Angel's eyes
Looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life
He's got the Devil inside
Look at the Angel's eyes
Looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life

He's looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life
He's looking to sacrifice the sanctity of life
