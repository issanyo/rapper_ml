[Verse 1]

She grew up near a mountain, shoes off in a fountain
Dress hiked up with her fists, she splashes around about him
Remembers when she found him
Gave him love, he gave her a pounding
Lips split, she did the same, she’s thrilled to be without him
Inject the likes of me into her life story here
Alcoholic friends of mine communicate with beer
Dragged to a local waiting room that serves drinks
The escapist steps outside for nicotine to think
Girl walks up, she’s a spy and a flirt
My eyes look left, my lips dry, I lick em, I’m high as her skirt
Conversations, eyelashes batting average
Had me text inside to friends that I-o-u-t of the tavern
Continued to talk during the walk, not sure what was said
When I looked down her shirt and got caught
She smirks, lips kiss then opened an inch
Tongues barely touch and she pulls her head back and says

[Hook]

I am not accustomed to feel alright
I am not accustomed to feel alright
I am not accustomed to feel alright
That’s okay, I got my own s**t that keeps me up all night
She said
I am not accustomed to feel alright
I am not accustomed to feel alright
I am not accustomed to feel alright
That’s okay, I got my own s**t that keeps me up all night

[Verse 2]

Put my arm around her shoulder to pull her closer to the team
Phone goes berserk it’s hers, her friends are stirrers in a scene
Probably one of many that I wouldn’t pay a penny to be at
I see the teeth marks, girl, that’s where they feed at
Said no to the invite, fell prey to a con and her charm
The look in her eye triggers my thumb to hit my car alarm
She’s shotty, I’m probably minutes from the finish
She’s symmetrically a menace to my in a sentence
Each one of her movements draws me in
My loss, her win, trying to keep eyes on the street and off her skin
Pull up to her building, she’s single and healing
Maybe I shouldn’t come up, maybe I should but until when?
Stumble to her couch, she brings up her life again
Her cocaine high shot past my long-faded Vicodin
She disclosed too much info up her nose
The bruise around her neck she was into her mouth closed
When I said

[Hook]
