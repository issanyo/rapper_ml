[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Intro]
Just the two of us just you and I
Slim Shady brain dead like Jim Brady im a M
Downside and Up
[Verse 1]
Bitch lady
Nerd bitch like Jan Brady
Bit a Cage baby
Caught rabies and went crazy
Acting out the life of Cage childhood steez
Wearing straight jackets in you're videos and magazines
Let me take a poll how many want it in the chest?
'Cause this is what if KRS pulled Shan from his flesh
And threw his fucking Pumas off "The Bridge" with his kids
So bring more fire-arms than a school of burning squids
[Skit]
OHHHH
Yo what the fuck
AHHH Cage Yo
AH Fu AH
AHH SHIT YO
Ay dog
Put everything on the fucking tape
Aight aight aight
Later
[Snippet 2]
Fuck you lookin' for when your only squad is your Adlibs?
(Hey I need help!)
Yeah! and you don't stop!
'Cause Dre got a new puppet for his fake Hip Hop!
