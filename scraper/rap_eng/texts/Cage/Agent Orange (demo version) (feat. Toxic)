[Intro: Cage -Dialogue interpreted from film 'Clockwork Orange')
"There was me, Alex... and three of my fam...
All supposed to meet at the Korova Milk Bar...
The Korova Milk Bar couldn't afford it's liquor license
So it sold milk plus Drencrum, or Synthemesc...
It would sharpen you up for a bit of the old ultraviolence
Which we had in mind for the evening
And so kiddies...
Death for all... right right?

[Verse One: Cage]
I'm Against the Machine like Rage; bitches say, 'I hate you Cage!'
After circle jerks, I wash my hands off and do dirt
Sick with a smirk, plus I be disturbed
Fucked the first two bitches like dogs and I jacked off on the third
I'm obvious oblivion but that's my science
Fuck your head up like corn rows put in by blind giants
Haven't been with it, since the last corpse kidded
Wore a blood stained smile, and told the cops, 'He did it!'
Of course the most raw throughout the
9 - 1 - 4 , 1 - 0 - 9 - 4 - 0
Got you beasts shook like Doc Moreau
Pour beer out for yourself because you're walking dead
I'll burn your house down like a fuckin Talking Head
And get high like fuck, and pick apart my brain
Disections may mentally cause infections
Break you with inventions, sick intentions
Feel no niggas lost in my sentence
I'm strictly, beyond and back, come and get me
Hemotobin, left from a lip like a hickie
Leak smoke got me ready to murder a rookie
Killers on your block tuck in they dicks like Tootsie
Come and witness what your shit missed
Watch the Glock kiss, Little Sis' wet her like a Baptist
Inconvenience; dilemma, like sitting on, Venus
With no shuttle, treeless
Try and pick apart my spaced out perception
Catch frontal lobe damage and not manage correction
I smell leak smoke, left by the anonymous
Beats brought back to life die when I'm embalming this
Come around and get your ass shot to clusters
I'ma play the injuns with the arrows you be Custards... back
I ride up on ya, divorce your head and neck, then scalp it
Rip off all your flesh and make a outfit

[Verse Two: Toxic]
I'm out of order, uniquely freaky
Hell of a fella, turning virgins into Jazzybellas
Perverted shit I'm with again
I shop for ho midgets on tip toes
Or flip bimbos and dick nymphos
Through their crotchless panties and their pantyhose
Intercourse cannibal, already giving orgasms
Rough sex and rocking the leather hell-raiser outfit
I come equipped looking the sickest
Everyt'ing is silicone tits and leaving handprints on big biscuits
Experienced Minajatwas with Siamese twins twice
Yo let's be precise eat sliced mics like salami
The opposite of Gandhi
I stay calm until it's time to make the blood spill
No frills get killed, I bring it to your grill like a mask
Trooping with my task force, lost in this life of crime
This life of mine is wild
Bullets ejected in my direction but fuck it
We just strike back retaliation laser slugs
Even thugs drop once the can is popped
I'm not a problem giver, a strong absolver
Three fifty seven revolver bomber
The shorty trauma jiggy rough don armed robber
And super villain super sperm injector
He stays wet like an umbrella when in all sectors...

[Verse Three: Cage]
I survived abortion; got mushed in that canister shaped coffin
Til stolen ('that bitch') from the garbage I was tossed in
Instincts, snatch your cream like links
Blow shotguns through the sky, making E. T. eyes chink
See me twistin leak with my peeps from psychiatrics
Get high, run up in ya crib and fuck ya moms backwards
Lost in the dust, don't give a fuck about dangerous
I'm in it for the whip, plus the cream and the head... rush
Ready to bust any trick that talk slick
Got a crew of devils in my head that force me to walk...
With, death in my pocket for the curious
At your execution see twelve faces of Jesus in your jury list
Madness defines sickens morticians
Losing their lunch when they hear what Alex been licking
I murder chickens sixteen and over
Angels out to get me because I'm higher than Jehovah
Necro should've told ya
Alex three thousand be arosing clicks up to your feet
And stick with brain damage oh childish men
Tality, turn up the bass and stick out my abnormality
Exposing your faculty, I got insect specks and the time selects
Freestyles burn used to artists to relics
Ma Dukes is just a cherry on top
Spendin G's on quacks to try an fix my Clock
I caught the quick lock, buggin in the institution
Whatever sanity was left, caught the execution
Psychological pollution, they stickin me with Thorazine solution
Shootin at the sky lookin for Godly retribution
And I can almost see clear
I start buggin like a insect and lay larvae in ya ear
And as the worm blow my flow make you more irritable
Choking on your cum coughing out your blood through your nasal
Thought you was a hard rock, that's a rumor like the loch-
Nostalgic Fijis makes complex the simplest...

[Outro: Cage]
Alright just go back to the beginning cuz he's going to go in...
