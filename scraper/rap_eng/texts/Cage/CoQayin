[Verse 1-Sam Hill]
An eclipse of full moon
Fools doom
Haunted by a devil
Just crawled out of his cocoon
Strays days then feeds the whole story
Death is obligatory conjured with allegory
Shooting stars let 'em bleed out
I was throwing lances
Unless of course my corpse was being Necromantic
To noble rape
I had no idea what romance is
I stuck my face in her butt and saw Atlantis
Human sacrifice
How I'm hoping you role up
Don't over look any orifice like Ebola
Sick bitches suck on me like a Ricola
Can't fuck her throat until I removed her molars
Stayed with needles since the DJ was diabetic
Shoot up like a high school student reading dianetics
Awfully radically as we practice black magic
We unattractively savagely
Spill your blood for the dragon G

[Chorus]
You're going too far
I can't go far enough
You need to get higher
I can not go beyond enough
Everything under the sun is yours
And it's not enough
Let me in
I'll win over your heart like cocaine

[Verse 2]
Tree of life
Human limbs but no branches
Semi-Automatic trigger like a college campus
Shoot the cadaver repeatedly it fuckinâ€™ dances
Every non believer
You're at a disadvantage
Read the book out loud
So what you say enhances
Bitches eating me post sex like a praying mantis
In a make shift crown
Made from a skull and antlers
As I started to transform repeating the mantras
Purify the hatred
I feel no love
Only thing touchin' my heart will be a cold glove
When it's kickin' from my chest
And it's sewn up
The only bitches I turn off are in a coma
The house of God is a tool shed with no cellar
Throwin' Hail Marys with babies into a propeller
Privileged [?]
Is the Pope when he has a dream
Reload the magazine and send them all to see Nazarene

[Chorus]
You're going too far
I can't go far enough
You need to get higher
I can not go beyond enough
Everything under the sun is yours
And it's not enough
Let me in
I'll win over your heart like cocaine
