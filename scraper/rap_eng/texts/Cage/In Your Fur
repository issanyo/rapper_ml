[Verse 1: Cage]
Would you like more
Redecorate your décor
With my face in the bullet hole
Safety's off pull it ho
My life is a cigarette you put it out
You were the ashtray that I needed bitch good looking out
The Michael Jordan of bad decisions
Eating Peyote out of visions
Flying like a rabid pigeon
Followed like a mad religion
I stopped believing after death payed a tragic visit
And the illusion of my life and what magic isn't

[Hook]
Club you in your fur
Let me club you in your fur
Club you in your fur
Imma club you in your fur
Club you in your fur
Let me club you in your fur
Club you in your fur
I want to club you in your fur

[Verse 2: Cage]
Get yo bat at discount, what you mad at?
Bitch look at your coat, where’s your cat at?
Yes I want it fresh like a cannibal
At dinner dressed like hannibal
Why you hiding out under the flesh of an animal
Words served up in a cryptic trough
When you can taste success and have somethings skin ripped off
Waiting for a low she overdose on bufferin'
Cardiac arrest in her sleep with no sufferin'

[Hook]
Club you in your fur
Let me club you in your fur
Club you in your fur
Imma club you in your fur
Club you in your fur
Let me club you in your fur
Club you in your fur
I want to club you in your fur
