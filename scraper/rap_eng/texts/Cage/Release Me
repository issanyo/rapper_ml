[Music: Eric Horton / Dave Garcia / Sean Peck]

Everyday everyday we struggle to survive
Such complicated lives
Feel the pain can't stand the strain
We constantly go through
Only one thing you can do
Seek separation
It brings to me expectations

Need escape get away
Seek shelter from the storm
Some place safe and warm
Find the flame the astral plane
Beyond the things we know
So damn bad I want to go
Separation it brings to me
Revalations

Release me release my soul
Release me let me go
Release me release me
Release me release me let me go

Find the truth seek proof the answer to it all
Will we rise of fall
When will it end does it begin and and the begin again
Take me with you won't you friend
Separation it brings to me
New sensations

Release me release my soul my soul
Release me let me go
Release me release me release me
