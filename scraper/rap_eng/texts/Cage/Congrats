[Verse 1]
Can you count the fucks
That you don’t give about what somebody thinks
Even if you try to score
L’s will wait like hockey sticks
The gift, the gift, is knowing shit’s a curse
Subvert
Eat your life up your death is dessert, it's dessert
Thought it would be everything but it wasn’t any of it
Just a bunch of lames in a pseudo-coven
Probably try to kill me if I make it public
The rape, of the minds, reluctant
Escaped Illuminati puppet
Cut its strings off and fled from the star

[Chorus]
When will it ever end?
It won’t
When will she ever leave?
She won’t
You are the dumbest bitch
I’ve ever known
Congrats
When will it ever end?
It won’t
When will she ever leave?
She won’t
You are the dumbest bitch
I’ve ever known
Congrats

[Verse 2]
Did you get your piety confused with omnipotence?
For your tusk of relevance
Your face cut off like elephants
I’m lit... like I’m in hell
Exhale like a crematorium
From the sanitorium
Until the words in my memorium
Bitch, suck it like it’s made of jelly
You paid a milly
Gives no fucks
You can roll your sleeves down
I keep ‘em up, I don’t hide those cuts
Just wanted my pockets to be fatsos
And not have to acquiesce to assholes
And not have to wind up on desolate back-roads
And be surrounded by dudes in black robes
Did you go quietly for opulence and decadence
Cause we went maniacally for malevolence and reverence
Cause I thought defiantly as you walked along the precipice
Didn’t give a fuck what you thought then
Why the fuck would ya give a fuck now?

[Chorus]
When will it ever end?
It won’t
When will she ever leave?
She won’t
You are the dumbest bitch
I’ve ever known
Congrats
When will it ever end?
It won’t
When will she ever leave?
She won’t
You are the dumbest bitch
I’ve ever known
Congrats
