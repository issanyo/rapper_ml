[Verse 1]
Could not forget about the dress
You didn't  wear it to impress
I said you look nice my voice was breaking
Giving you flowers hands were shaking
When I met you, you were ten
Even though things were different then
I still get the butterflies around you
I get weak down to my knees

[Chorus]
You and I, we could fly together
Like a hot air balloon in the sky
Take your time, we could last forever
Silver rain you make me feel so divine
Ooooooh Ooooooh
Like a hot air balloon in the sky
Ooooooh Ooooooh
Silver rain you make me feel so divine

[Verse 2]
It's been twenty years or so
And you're still as beautiful as flowers grow
We're not together we're united
Smell of your skin is on my blanket
It's our song don't need no ring
Because of you I want to sing
We don't need to say "I love you"
Cause I know where I've you

[Chorus]
You and I, we could fly together
Like a hot air balloon in the sky
Take your time, we could last forever
Silver rain you make me feel so divine
Ooooooh Ooooooh
Like a hot air balloon in the sky
Ooooooh Ooooooh
Silver rain you make me feel so divine

[Bridge]
Scream a little louder
Jump a little further
Laying here beside her
If it rains don't even bother

Scream a little louder (louder)
Jump a little further
Laying here beside her
If it rains don't even

[Chorus]
You and I, we could fly together
Like a hot air balloon in the sky
Take your time, we could last forever
Silver rain you make me feel so divine
Ooooooh Ooooooh
Like a hot air balloon in the sky
Ooooooh Ooooooh
Silver rain you make me feel so divine
