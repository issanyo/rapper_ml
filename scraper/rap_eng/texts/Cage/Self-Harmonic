(Cage)
So my cousins were into satanism
They would go out and they would get a goat
They'd bring it back home, join hands in a circle around the goat
And they repeated this chant over and over 'til the goat started to get really really excited, kicking around
They believed they were bringing Satan into the goat's body,
The goat would eventually throw up, thus giving you Satan in a gelatinous form,
To eat

Verse 1 [Bane]
Just took a moment or two for me to realize,
That real life don't feel right, got lost in a surreal mind....state
Self medicate to give me clear sight,
But feel light blisterin' the skin upon my face
I'm in this dark dark place, openin' up a vein to taste
The blood coagulate
Start shiftin' my shape into new forms
As night falls resume my true form
Torn from the womb at full moon, I never knew dawn
Too gone to consider reconciliation
The virus filling each capillary with it's mutations
Breath taking
So full control was surrendered the same day I sold my soul,
To the shadows, I feel increasingly shallow
The deeper I get, the more my mind narrows
I'm too paranoid to hear my true calling
And I amplify my voice above the sound of bugs swarming

Verse 2 [Cage aka Chris Palko]
I gave up too much information what was true to Chris
I bought tickets to Budapest but ended up in Bucharest,
Romania, I'm thinking Transylvania, we're born in blood
But I left stitches in my mother's labia, now that's cool
Childish and act cruel, take me to Dracula
I want to see his grave and eat MDMA capsules
Waitin' around for a vampire to really surface,
When all along I'm with one I met in Piccadilly Circus
She saw the burns in my wrist and thought it was cute,
Escapin' my cell turns out I was just running from you
The bite marks all over my neck have wasted a stupid hour,
What good is being a vampire with no superpowers?
It's boring as can be and to insignificantly see, see, see
And W, M, whee [???]
You wanna be a statue, go get a tattoo
Of my brotherhood on your body, family for life if they ask you

Verse 3 [Bane]
It's like I receive life, and die between bites of the hunger,
Hooked up to the jugular, trying to siphon the blood dry
My time here is infinite, existence inconspicuous
Each sentence subject to guilt, I live oblivious
I'm in and out of the ether, [???] of anemia
Immortality's price is eternal life with a heavy fever
Buried even deeper, with various demons to speak to,
My Luciferia roots got the blood tastin' even sweeter
With each sip I slurp, slippin' further into Purgatory,
Burdened with this constant thirst, a purpose cost me permanently
Allergic to UV, my skin blisters and burns,
To the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree, cuz I'm nocturnal breed
It's unclean, unconditional love precedes the pain,
As if my hearts encased with bone,
Like I'm infected with the Reaper Strain
I treat the vein like its the most precious elixer,
And it ain't the source of sustenance, so I'm a permanent fixture
