[Cage]

Let's get this bourbon poured
Puff some herb indoors
If life's a bitch then show her
Who the fuck she's workin' for
She's a perfect whore
That little skirt's a score
Life sucks, so you let her
Fuck you until her cervix is torn
And then a turd is born
Another worthless corn
Always cunts, assholes and dicks
Around these words of porn
In a perfect storm
Surface in serpent form
Sent here to eat, shit, fuck, rap, burp and mourn

Why am I so destroyed?
It's a distraction
Why talk to God?
I don't even know what to ask him
Looking for passion
Something to bash in
With my fists, I'm in need
Of total satisfaction

Go for mine and go for yours
And I have no remorse
These words are fly
Cause of moth eggs in my vocal cords
Now what you were hopin' for is
Smokin' coke in Coors
Cans, bent in half
To deal with being broke and poor
I should focus or
Find out what this rope is for
Swing from the rafters
With a belly full of croque-monsieur
Then I'll explode manure
I closed a broken door
Prove the spirit world exists
And I will go for sure
Or I could cope some more
Cop a smoke on tour
The wormholes in my arms
From doing dope sulfur
That shit'll soak the floor
When it leaks like an open sore
Self-loathe, self-medicated, self-saboteur

Why am I so destroyed?
It's a distraction
Why talk to God?
I don't even know what to ask him
Looking for passion
Something to bash in
With my fists, I'm in need
Of total satisfaction

And I'm so paranoid
What's the attraction?
I'm seeing shit that you
Couldn't even imagine

Why am I so destroyed?
It's a distraction
Why talk to God?
I don't even know what to ask him
Looking for passion
Something to bash in
With my fists, I'm in need
Of total satisfaction
