[Music: Dave Garcia]

When you feel scared or problems arise you need someone to hypnotize he will look in your mind
Instant induction a visual spash merging of emotions done so fast
Addictions in rewind

He'll mentally molest you
Professionally trained
His evil will infest you
Psychotically deranged

With an impression he'll make you sing neural linguistic programming
Who knows what he will find
Best to make sure nothing goes wrong
His power of suggestion is so strong
Your will he'll try to bind

He'll mentally molest you
Professionally trained
His evil will infest you
Psychotically deranged

He'll destroy your mental wall through hypnosis hear his call
Hear his call
Hear his call
Telling your future by reading your past
Past life regression removing yor mask

Feeding the frenzy that swarms in your head
What you're revealing is best left unsaid
I'll snap my fingers then you'll awake
Your problems will linger
Your money I'll take

So soothing the voice so bank are the eyes
It's all designed to mesmerize
Relax try to unwind
He's taking control he just won't let go
Done in such a way that you'll never know
You've got such little time

He'll mentally molest you
Professionally trained
His evil will infest you
Psychotically deranged

Your true protector is your unconscious mind
