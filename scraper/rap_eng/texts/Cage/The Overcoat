[Verse 1: Dead Smoke]
Bout occult Hermetic Traditions
Fighting in Hebrew
I'm talking to Jah smoking the weed doob
I got the ski scooped from wrong side of town
Hit the blunt with pressure
Picked up the mic n then fucked this sound
These kids don't know nothin', trying to act ruff
Frontin' in a strangers crib in a video trying to look tough
Somebody else's hand up ya ass puppet bitches
For 13 years Ive been vicious grinding on the streets
Around dope looking suspicious
Kicking back with my boys playing deaths games like toys
Till our time comes up we walk life's line with poise
God don't give death up as a choice
Dead friends, can't mend this unbound dead head
Smoke in my veins like dope in my brain
I enter into other states tripping with the Snake
I gut ya triple six shit with a strait blade

[Hook:]
Cover my crazy with this overcoat
Made of drugs and drank until I motherfucking overdose
(Like to snap)
Cover my crazy with this overcoat, overcoat
(Like to snap, like a switch blade, like to snap)
I cover my crazy with this overcoat
Made of drugs and drank until I motherfucking overdose
(Like to snap)
Cover my crazy with this overcoat, overcoat
(Like to snap, like a switch blade with a fucking pearl handle)

[Verse 2: Cage]
I get lost in the melee
Cause I can't wait to get loaded like a AK
And this bitch goes down yelling mayday
Drunk, throw-up on the steps, yelling fuck A.A
I kill bitches like I got an axe on me, hell
I got bitches on me like I used axe body gel
Stuck my face in the perfect set
While my brain was trying to fight off the Percocet
Off the rails can't steer though, ran over some weirdo
Shit comes out my mouth, and I let it fuck ya ear hole
Hang out when the girls ample
Like to snap snap like a switch blade with a fucking pearl handle
The word of God don't put no fear in me
And, until then its just another stupid conspiracy
You can stick ya head in the sand like an ostrich
Or loose that shit like an American hostage

[Hook: x2]
