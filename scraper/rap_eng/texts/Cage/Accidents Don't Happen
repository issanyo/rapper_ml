O'Brien: How does one man assert power over another?
Winston: By making him suffer
O'Brien: Exactly

[El-P]
Yo, I touch with rusted clutch spun out of the dust
And careen into the temples of automated destruct
Nanotech bugs in the blood get unplugged
Fishing for the fly shit hybrid
I run among the mudskipper swarms through warnings in Good Morning Beirut
Little BillyBlunderbuss looking for more recruits
City life is practice, casket truancy
That's the rule of you and me, brash unmasked lunacy
Friends used to laugh fast, grasped little truth from me
Now they check their bags with a staff claspin' Uzis
Who deserves a wrath without warning?
The same sky for the martyr with a spork
Scorch, New York forfeit
Run among the poppy fields order some more clips
Store trips are weird but the fear is forceless
Bloomey bought the city of Lego and shitty metal hull
Jitters to the floor boards, burned
Almost aborted
Flight of the accidental tourist: morbid
The advertising gods so oddly court shit
Godly corporate squads plot these tortures
Holiness is hard and it's costing god fortunes
(guess he took a second job on the force to afford it)
I don't want a part of these self fulfilled prophecies
Man it's too much for my stubbornness, I hate the people runnin' shit
Now if you sleep at ground o below, wishing you peaceful sleep
Where horror on the surface emerges less frequently
Metal bars of ancient Rome dissolved from the scenery (now what the fuck)
I'll take a hostage and walk through the mosh pit
Pristine untouched, NB703's untouched
Trust is a commodity crushed by Pol Pottery
Your cookie cutter laws contain flaws in philosophy
Toppling down a flight of Escher/Bach steps: delight
Cause the man who raped my sister won't sleep right tonight
Suppose the pretty horses in fours could love more
But I'm exhausted by the scope of this dark god on opiates
Breakfast for dystopia and ruthless hope movements
Seasonal infest of the butchery's lookin good
And now writers block is a prison camp where free press regress
Now we can hypnotize the herd
I'm alive with fly visions that attack like Alfred Hitchcock raising rabid carrier pigeons
True the only form of com not tapped is trapped strong
In the cranium of future rebel infants whistling song
I know you're listening, get down with this bitch, whistle along

O'Brien: ...Power is inflicting pain and humiliation. Otherwise, you can't be certain. Power is tearing human minds apart and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing

[Cage]
It's like the Bilderburgs came to dinner with filthy birds
They pussy all infected I'm lookin for milky words
They pulled my third eye out then they let it dry out
Had to pour my belief in Chrst to find out (I don't believe in)
What I look like with no skin
The movement faded while the back of my paper is stilluminated
Even your no flipped egyptian Euro
Got my website shut down by the Bureau
Can't kick it with the dead until my life stop
But Bush got a ouija to talk to Adam Weishaupt
I breath martyrs, turn fans to artists
Put a couple G's together before harvest light
I'll take all this
The hell I'm doin?
Dippin this whole fuckin' pound in enbalmin fluids
You think I rhyme to do it?
If it's on point try is
If you can't help but sleep peel off your eyelids

If you want a vision of the future...imagine a boot stamping on a human face

[CamuTao]
It's the year 2010, you can say what you want
But I bet if you light this blunt, dummy, the feds'll come runnin'
Lock you up, lock you out, you ain't tryin' to listen
Cameras in your food, dude, look they're trying to listen
Lock you up, lock you out, we got bugs in the house
We're being monitored, they know we got thugs in the house
Don't light your blunt, bitch, they'll hit you with a switch
Hit you with a beam, hit you in the brain, make you go totally insane
Wild out, guns in the spot, flippin' on you niggas
They take you out, then the Feds push guns on the roof
They take 'em out, snuffed you out cause you know too much
After that you know your ho's get touched
Look, then the meeting starts
Download your chick to a memory card
Give her chips and send her to a city job

Power is not a means, it's an end. In our world, there will only be triumph and self-effacement. Everything else we shall destroy
