[Intro]
Few days are good, most days are bad
This day is the best day I'll ever have
I'll ever have

[Hook]
Few days are good, most days are bad
This day is the best day I'll ever have
Woke up with a pain in my brain, eager to crash
This day is the best day I'll ever have
She snaps the blade when she takes a stab
This day is the best day I'll ever have
He put down the needle and became a dad
This day is the best

[Verse 1: Cage]
This lifetime ticking on death's clock is staged well
Want to escape worms in subways to hell
And you can meet your maker in a second
Depending on which maker you're checking
For me, it's who manufactures my records
I stood in the doorway unable to walk through it
When the voice in my head stopped, it can only be heard through music
So if you need me to do shit I will continue to make it
I'll put pain in a digital space in hopes to escape it
I guess I could be something I'm not
And write about who I shot
Whether it's real or not you embrace fake as hot
When your words are empty, your subject matter's elementary
But the kids are too advanced to pay for your fantasies
Love me or hate me, there's all or nothing to see for you
Now it's been established, step from in front of the people I'm speaking to
If I don't wake up tomorrow I'm living through kids rewinding the past
And you can take from you want from what I'll ever have

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cage]
Eyes open up, nod off, words get muttered
Butterflies and blood removed from his stomach
In a black bag he shuffled his car key oddly
Zipped the bag and unfolded to fit the size of his body
So amongst the godly or gully, where life takes you
Then you bring a life into the world and they can't save you
I tail chased the snail race too long
Just trying to put food on my kid's plate, sharing a box of croutons
Look through the keyhole, she hungry
You think I'm emo? It's funny...
Emo and NY's an anagram for money
Rip veins for old friends
Picked, seen through no lens
Clap for me or at me dog or the show ends
Live slow to be old men
I ain't trying to stop in a maze
When hands on the clock move like helicopter blades
If I don't wake up tomorrow I'm living through kids rewinding the past
And you can take from you want from what I'll ever have

[Hook]
