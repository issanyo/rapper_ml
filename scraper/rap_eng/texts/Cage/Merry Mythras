[Verse 1: Cage]
Freeze in the dying sun
All hail the defiant one
Stand around picketing
Hell on earth, Leviathan
Tripping off the visual
Hated by the invisible
Aided by the habitual
Doing drugs in my ritual
I'm a problem now
Especially if i've got a crowd
Don't want me to do it
Then don't tell me that I'm not allowed
Omens that you read about
Razor-blade banisters
Let the shit fill up your crib like tear gas canisters
Let them pirate there
That will keep them quiet where
They can be forcing piggies to go put on riot gear
Fuck all the peace neighbour
Not even least favored
The only thing still shocking is a police taser

[Hook x2]
You should worship the devil thats what they won't say
If you get out of hell it will be a cold day
Pawns throw up their hands symbols for okay
Because they follow the beast and want you obey

[Verse 2: Cage]
I want to get higher than God thats Hyperion
Looking for a light like a fucking Luciferian
I sit like a sumerian
Not stuck to your martyr story
Magic in the auditory
Get a little art of war-y
Paranoid mixing my bastard views
Turn that shit around and drink up with the mass confused
Try to wake my friends and family up then went door to door
Maybe because I dropped out wasn't fitted for a mortarboard
My skull and bones faced unholy odds
I'm a 33 degree Mason of Stony Lodge
Satan claws dug a hole and bury Christmas
Under a tree hellelujah merry mithras

[Hook x2]
You should worship the devil thats what they won't say
If you get out of hell it will be a cold day
Pawns throw up their hands symbols for okay
Because they follow the beast and want you obey
