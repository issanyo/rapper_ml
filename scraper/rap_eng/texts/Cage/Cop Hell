Street mu' fuckas wan' steal, this, shit
Sweet mommy butter gon' feel, this.. dick
Perfect aim, of purple rain, I hurt your dame
The first with 'caine, and my department sayin'
Shit, so I picked up, fixed up
Every connect that get the six up, got the feds mixed up
With cartels, cream machines like Carvel
Gettin' brain in the back of the plane like doorbells (Ding Dong)
Who is it? liquid kids, they gifted jizz
All work and no play, find a different busi'
Sprayin' pipe, or layin' pipe, my game is tight
Dead bitch in the ceilin' do you think she'll stay tonight?
Plate it right, I'm in my own hell, oh.. well
Little piece of heaven every time these hoes' sell
That sour broten every hour plottin'
P-O-L-I-C-E-M-A.. N rottin' in

Yo, I can, seize that cake, heat that face
DTs'll leave that ass, I delete that case
Protect me and that cash out, leave that place
'Cause if you want this dirt done it needs to be that way
Crack-heads throw bottles, we don't need that hate..
We crack heads for an hour.. free that base
Put men on it, and let the pen lean on 'em
If they don't hit us with our cut they get caught up!
And every police meetings and precincts will get brought up
Look, I scheme your bra, stealin' cars
So when you go to jury duty dude, the heat is on
And get crackin' with the police, you done did it!
I tow cars every weekend, who wants tickets?
And when I see bitches I holla, you gon' get it!
I plead stripper bitches with dollas to see them titties
Then squad'll pop up, to pick up Missy.. in

Fuck the town of Wallkill, bust the rounds, it's jaws still
Haters talk through the fence, hence, we on the ball field..
Cop creeper, Glock heater, that pops sweeter
Than that chick from Rocksteady after Fox beeped her..
NightHittawks, the right cake widdocks
Don't argue with a gun, hun, I'll take the tit off!
Milkin' apocalypse later, lets think now
Dog fights on me? they can't make this sit down!

[Camu Tao]
And I stay here.. 'till the cash is counted
And if a dollar's missin' I'mma blast your houses!
Bitches say I'm violent when I ask for silence
When I put 'em in a movie when they ass is dyin'
And get 'em coked up, have them asses flyin'
And get 'em smoked up, when them sirens cryin'
And get 'em knocked out when I call brigades!
Bring you up, FBI boys tossin' grenades..
In
