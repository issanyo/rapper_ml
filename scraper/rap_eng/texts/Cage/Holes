Verse 1: Weerd Science

My whole worldview is jaded and skewed
Most likely the byproduct from the drugs I abused
I used to make myself believe that
I was meant for something greater
But then the weight of the world
Weighted me down, baited my anger and
Invaded any peace that I ever had (ever had)
Made me a stranger to my mom and dad
Man created a creator and told me he's my savior
Wouldn't you look to the heavens and pray to him that he saves you
What a wonderful thought
So I did just that
Gotta reach into your heart and push the bad back
And all you had to was believe and except that
I couldn't stand in this light, I got that bad back
I got my bad back. Man, I'm on that fast track
Train of thought, Amtrak train your thoughts
Fingers crossed Stand Pat
I'm just the Vessel that the darkness appoints
After I die show up in hell like I own the fucking joint and..

Chorus:

(Bury yourself in the earth)
"These are the holes"
These are the holes that I dig and call home
(In your mind, with the darkness, is earth)
I don't know about your demons I'm at ease with my own
(Bury yourself in the earth)
In the land of the light I'm the shadow in the crowd
What lines will you leave behind when the world finally crosses you out

Verse Two: Cage

I'll never win awards, unless its for the wards
If you cut my hair off, you might see my horns
Chose fate to be in control of my destiny
Over an entity, always dooming, and never blessing me
I know exactly why I was put here
To eat, shit, and drink beer taking drugs and disappear
I anticipate what it would take
To make the great escape get so high
That on the way out you wear a cape
You can stay here and deal with it
Hate so much, you gotta love it
Your environment sucks
So do you if you're a product of it
Feels like there's nothing left to do here
But change the colors of the same old shit for the new year
What it is, really Isn't. Don't you know it?
Look ahead and now behind is above, so below it
Would I win? Everything you lose is mine to be found
Including the hole in the sky you find in the ground

Chorus:

(Bury yourself in the earth)
"These are the holes"
These are the holes that I dig and call home
(In your mind, with the darkness, is earth)
I don't know about your demons I'm at ease with my own
(Bury yourself in the earth)
In the land of the light I'm the shadow  the crowd
What lines will you leave behind when the world finally crosses you out

(Bury yourself in the earth)
"These are the holes"
These are the holes that I dig and call home
(In your mind, with the darkness, is earth)
I don't know about your demons I'm at ease with my own
(Bury yourself in the earth)
In the land of the light I'm the shadow  the crowd
What lines will you leave behind when the world finally crosses you out
