[Verse 1: Cage]
The day I tuned out was the day I tuned in
To a different world that was translucent
They have a different God, spend a different currency
Somebody open up the fuckin door, its an emergency
Get through the door, what do we do now
Make my self at home but I don't know how
In the fantasy maybe I could love them
In reality its really more like Fuck them
Let em Watch Me

[Hook]
Doin what I wanna do
Watch Me
Nothing you could really do but
Watch Me
Get the popcorn out and just
Watch Me
Only thing you could do is
Watch

[Verse 2]
If you get in you'll never get out
Its like bitches are ordered to give their shit out
Shes half nude, doing a nice dance
I'm drunk leaning up on the bar in a Christ stance
Ink is in the plants
Get so high, get lonely
The beast in my ear whispering "you owe me"
Maybe its because you should decay onto the street
I don't walk on anybody
They just lay under me feet
Where they Watch Me

[Hook]
Doin what I wanna do
Watch Me
Nothin you could really do but
Watch Me
Get the popcorn out and just
Watch Me
Only thing you could do is
Watch

[Verse 3]
[Monitoring] what you doin right now
What you sayin online
Where you spend your nights out
What you pull from your account
The stupid shit you purchased
Stranded on this planet so flawed lookin for purpose
Follower gotta be one fuck whos beneath us
Because they are lookin down on you much more than Jesus
Lucky to be halved by judges and lawyers
Cameras and loaded guns in the hands of Voyeurs
Watch Me

[Hook]
Doin what I wanna do
Watch Me
Nothin you could really do but
Watch Me
Get the popcorn out and just
Watch Me
Only thing you could do is
Watch
