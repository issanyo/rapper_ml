[Verse 1]

There’s nothing serene about nature through a reinforced screen
That can’t be kicked out by a sedated teen
I wanted an autograph of Northern Calloway
When we were in Stony Lodge together
I asked and got dragged away
He was the only celebrity I met as a kid, I still remember
The sheet over his face, his body on a stretcher
And the only food for thought that would feed my head
Was like my childhood, David from Sesame Street was dead

[Hook]

Hello? Is someone there?

[Verse 2]

I covered every base and solved that dirt from mystery
If don’t know you in my present I can’t recall you from my history
Distantly awake, violently shake near narcissism
You get away as fast as you can, it’s where the art isn’t
Kinda like a front group for a flock of casualties
The God they got for sale is in your wallet already actually
Green pictures of white men don’t answer prayers
But turn odds, I’m just a stacking Christ’s dads hope to burn God

[Hook]

Hello? Is someone there?
Of course you see me, there’s cameras everywhere
You know? We’re just like the press
A bunch of reporters and liars spying on each other

[Verse 3]

I think of the past and how the future isn’t how I imagined it
But the past is exactly right where I unraveled it
Excuses for failed attempts, gained another one I used a noose
It’s not until you fall apart you see the screws are loose
And the screwdriver’s in the hands of the girl you live with
And show affection when those you love are agents of deception
Faces come and go, the lies disguised as purity
It tastes better than the reality, body meets obscurity

[Hook]

Hello? I know you’re there
If you’ve come to get me you can wait with despair
You know? There’s not much left
But you’re welcome to help yourself along with all the rest
