[Verse 1]
I'll let evil in the night
That shit told me what to write
Don't let it grow or in the end it might
I'll cut its throat, won't even let it fight
You can't fill up my head with hype
Broken infamies extra tight
I'm super baked changed out of spite
See in the dark like it's fucking light
(What you are?) Fuck it all
I'm not a marionette, I'm not a puppet doll
I'm dressed to kill and got nothing on
You got a razor blade cut along
Down both your arms and around your necklace
Down your chest pull out your intestines
Throw your blood in a cross a fetus
As I fulfill the prophecy

[Hook]
Tonight is the perfect night to take a life I might
Even do it with a favorite knife
I’d like to move up from rabbits, snakes and mice
The light, it is a black flame, black light bright
Is the path when you're in your reading room to write
If you think the reaper's in the room then white
Darkness  has created you to the
Scythe is in the left hand when greeting you with the rite

[Verse 2]
Desert rain, death and pain
So much violence I just came
The holy ghost before its slained
The overdose is in my vein
Before the fire you say the name
I'm on tenth floor and you're in the elevator game
Read the book 'til it lifts you
Pulls your pants down and licks you
Black corpse around you, take a picture
I'll wipe my ass with this scripture
My mothers womb made Devil [days]
After the grave of lemon haze
I saw your God on his knees so he is not...
Salve Qayin! Salve Azerate!

[Hook]
Tonight is the perfect night to take a life I might
Even do it with a favorite knife
I’d like to move up from rabbits, snakes and mice
The light, it is a black flame, black light bright
Is the path when you're in your reading room to write
If you think the reaper's in the room then white
Darkness  has created you to the
Scythe is in the left hand when greeting you with the rite
You're right if you think the reaper's in the room to scythe
Isn't the left hand we bringing to you, right?
If you think the reaper's in your room to scythe
Isn't the left hand we bringing to you
