[Verse 1: Cage]
It feels so good
When I wake up in my skin like it should
Nothing to regain
Don't give a shit about your claims
If it rains
If the sun shines
If the bitch I fuck has any brains
Lines of caine
Cut across the table for your pain
Using one straw the hepatitis game
The precipiss of fame
Thinkin up ways to make a name
Should cut your face up why look the same
As your fuckin followers
Wear it on your face sometimes your swollowers
Then walkin out the house without my monitors
Slitherin alone
Killin two birds, the one stoned
Imagine the shit you could kill from the throne
Fuckin Rome
I am a slave until my record's bein mastered
Until then Im still a dad and a bastard
Probably why my eggs were in one basket
Because I saw myself dead in a casket
All bloody, embalmed and filled with acid

[Hook]
Save your horror stories, mine are gorier
Any bitch I can't get wet is an American Ninja Warrior
Went from I don't give a fuck to
Maybe I could with a little love
But when I did nobody did
Now I'm back to I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
High times Infinity the only entity
Till Marijuana made that shit the Holy Trinity
Escapeful remedy
I admit to losing my brain like Kennedy
And you guys were like Jackie-O, covered and now you remember me
No one invented me
I made my overdose an art form
Suck my dick if I've offended thee
Eat my imagery, Use my energy
Heartless, no stem in me
Delete me from your hard drive bitch
I'm still in your memory
Stay in the zone
Smokin, speaking to unknown
Forces suggest this is at home
March for what the beast got us
As a kid was the oddest
The drive and the determination of a young Jihadist
If I'm being honest
I relate to hate in America burning Kushy
And trying to blow myself up for virgin pussy
If the son of God jumped out of the cunt of Madonna
I would stab Dave Grohl in the face to get to Nirvana

[Hook]
Save your horror stories, mine are gorier
Any bitch I can't get wet is an American Ninja Warrior
Went from I don't give a fuck to
Maybe I could with a little love
But when I did nobody did
Now I'm back to I don't give a fuck
