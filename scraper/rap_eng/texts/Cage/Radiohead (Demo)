Armstrong: "One small step for a man... one giant leap for mankind"

Flippin' up your city here comes Alex the whirlwind
Twistin' up your brains droppin' shit New York to Berlin
Come back, blitz-krieg in the whole New York region
Grab your bitch and burn like HIV lesions
Keep your eyes open show your team where the Glocks is
Pour some disinfectant in your ears I'm speaking noxious
Alex the baby came after afterbirth
I ain't been straight with god since he dropped my ass on earth
"You're gonna burn for that"
Then burn me right now Paul!
My scalp still wears a scar from that lobotomy seminar
Can't help but act out
When I black out
I push my brother odds in then I kick him back out
You kids tryin' to blast at me better learn to shoot straighter
Premature brains get cooked up in an incubator
Page 67 paragraph 2;
Show persistence in your outer, skin MC's alive, man you
My brain's so packed with shit
From years of playing toilet every time i fucking [?]
Everyday's a rage and I can't escape living in sci-fi flicks I
Eat out chinese and [?]

I'm a radiohead
Gettin' open 'till I'm brain dead
And Then I'm gettin' open 'till you brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Get you open 'till I'm brain dead
Then I'll get you open 'till you brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Gettin' open 'till you brain dead
Then I'm gettin' open 'till I'm brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Get you open 'till I'm brain dead
Then I'm gettin' open 'till you brain dead

The ludicrousness is the insignificance
Since my mothers insemense spawned the nastiest of lynguists
I popped out the snatch wiped my face clean of the crap
That's been holding me back since minus 9 months my leaky sack
Blind ya till you see behind ya
Who could undermine tha
Sickest of intelligents defined ya
The vagina redesigna
Get you opened out your own mind, ya
Sent to death trying to
Slide out your own spine to
Find a life where your cock's treated like Christ
And every cunt from off your block will beg forgiveness from your sexdevice
Twice birthed it
Questionably [?]
Umbilical noose scars on my neck from where I'm first led
You're scared of death so you wear a vest
Fuck protective flesh
I pinch it back and push your soul out your chest
Comming this winter straight jackets by North Face
Ate 3 all girl schools and could spit out how each whore taste
Record shops will see more fiends than a detox
When cage shit drops
Like LSD blots
You can't handcuff what you can't snuff
Before your body's embalmed I dip the philly for a puff

I'm a radiohead
Gettin' open 'till I'm brain dead
And Then I'm gettin' open 'till you brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Get you open 'till I'm brain dead
Then I'll get you open 'till you brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Gettin' open 'till you brain dead
Then I'm gettin' open 'till I'm brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Get you open 'till I'm brain dead
Then I'm gettin' open 'till you brain dead

I was possessed by Dionysis
Kicked out of high school for giving pap smears in crisis
Cold type cyphers
I burn motherfuckers 'till the fumes kick
Then I'm fucking them 4 Craft bitches to death with broomsticks
Sweepin' with chicks lacing up knicks gettin' lovely
'till I'm spaced out roughly like martians playing rugby
See a vigilante, shoot him 'till his heart stops
And send his eyes to the [?] cops from crime watch
Catch my pipebomb style then find your finger
Bloody in a chicken from a leg breast thigh or winger [<<!--???]<br-->Love to think of
Shit that i tinker
Past the brink of
Losing my brains into the sickest forms of kink ya
Motherfucks catch murder delux
My lyrics puncture the fattest cuts where liposucks broke [??]
Super bitch cunning
Still not yet adapted to this life that i've been flung in
With limbs numbing

I'm a radiohead
Gettin' open 'till I'm brain dead
And Then I'm gettin' open 'till you brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Get you open 'till I'm brain dead
Then I'll get you open 'till you brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Gettin' open 'till you brain dead
Then I'm gettin' open 'till I'm brain dead
I'm a radiohead
Get you open 'till I'm brain dead
Then I'm gettin' open 'till you brain dead
