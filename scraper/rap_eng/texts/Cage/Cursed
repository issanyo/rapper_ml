[Verse 1]
? i honestly hate
Death is a cunt, thinks my silence can wait
Raped to this day because the style is so great
My whore to bury, extraordinary
Anarchy loose on America's porch
Don't look in the eyes of my character's corpse
Sucked from the skies and turned them to guys
That want every thing that they may have survived
You drop names like I drop LSD
But the names you drop make no one jealous
Im fully tied up, my brain on blunts
I can still draw a crowd like flaming monks

[Hook]
Dying of thirst, I'll quench what I've nursed
I'm cursed, i feel like im cursed
When I'm at my best, it's only my worst
I'm cursed i tell you I'm cursed

[Verse 2]
I don't care if there's an afterlife or after earth
Whats after me disregard, like afterbirth
She put me to sleep so i cut her with NoDoz
Some of this chicken blood thrown in my photos
? via
Satellite, evil presidents sent to mia
Can't get this stain out, so i burn my Wallabies
Sticking the pins in the dick on the ?
You think that heaven has ?
Hell is just whores i have already been in
Should i shut up? or do you want more?
I misread the cow tongue you nailed to my front door

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Escape from yourself until you lose all your ends
I'd rather lose friends than hallucinogens
Halloween candy and drugs to feed you
Dead rappers ghosts write me words through the Ouija
Am i possessed, lets have a seance
That must be why i wrote this song in crayons
Hanging from my neck, both wrists bleeding
Flip my cars over, bitch, finish my reading
Shamans and fire, peyote and savagery
Fuck the difference between real and pageantry
Evil is here, turn off your flashlight
I said the lord's prayer backwards last night

[Hook]

I'v sewn open my eyelids
I'v sewn open my eyelids
I'v sewn open my eyelids
I'v sewn open my eyelids
I'v sewn open my eyelids
I'v sewn open my eyelids
I'v sewn open my eyelids
I'v sewn open my eyelids
