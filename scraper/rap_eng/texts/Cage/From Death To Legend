With the dawn of his death we thought the war came to an end
With his last breath no one would listen again
The new world was weak, his passing was part of their plan
Now as we speak he's becoming much more than a man

Lost alone and forsaken
Surrounded by bodies that fell
You're the next to be taken
He's taking you with him to hell
Grant his majesty his final wish
Eliminate money and greed
Give him your hand and he'll give you his mark
Then you'll have all that you need

He went from death to legend
From death to legend
From death to legend and back again
From death to legend (Live by his lie he'll take you, nowhere to hide)
From death to legend (He'll break you taking, his mark will bring the end)
From death to legend and back again

Live by his lie he'll take you
Nowhere to hide
He'll break you taking his mark will bring the end

Statues and towers were built in his name
And still his power reached out from the grave
Voices and images telling us all to obey
Follow them flawlessly, he says that we'll all be saved

Lost alone and forsaken
Surrounded by bodies that fell
You're the next to be taken
He's taking you with him to hell
Grant his majesty his final wish
Eliminate money and greed
Give him your hand and he'll give you his mark
Then you'll have all that you need

He went from death to legend
From death to legend
From death to legend and back again
From death to legend (Live by his lie he'll take you, nowhere to hide)
From death to legend (He'll break you taking, his mark will bring the end)
From death to legend and back again

Lead us to slaughter just like the unknowing lamb
The lords of chaos held us in the palm of their hands
Lucifer's forces are gathering ready to strike
You've taken the chip marked by the Antichrist

Lost alone and forsaken
Surrounded by bodies that fell
You're the next to be taken
He's taking you with him to hell
Grant his majesty his final wish
Eliminate money and greed
Give him your hand and he'll give you his mark
Then you'll have all that you need

He went from death to legend
From death to legend
From death to legend and back again
From death to legend (Live by his lie he'll take you, nowhere to hide)
From death to legend (He'll break you taking, his mark will bring the end)
From death to legend and back again
