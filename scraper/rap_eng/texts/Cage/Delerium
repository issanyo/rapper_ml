[Verse 1: Tame One]
My first hit of this fresh dip
My skull splits just like some chick’s ass
Quick fast, the lights flickered and flashed as I got trashed
Past, present, or future just combined
To intertwine with visuals
Criminal chemicals mess with the sensible
Men turned to vegetables, welcome to Hell
Have you sweating like Alexander O’Neal on stage doing songs with Cherrelle
Unusual smells, bells and whistles, the voices in my head
Rock riddles while I pick the locks in mental hospitals
Little brain stuck, purple rained up
The sky cried and clouds cough
I know it sounds off, walls I bounce off
It’s awful, just what is this drug doing to ballers
With a fifty dollar bottle from out the funeral parlor
Blacking out like me in the open
Super smoking and soaking something
Too potent, love boating until I’m floating
Until I exhale forgetting details
Mentally blazed off of half the haze then pass it to Cage

[Verse 2: Cage]
I blasted out my Wallies, went through the roof on the zoom
(Cage just fucked up my room) My hands are two fucking balloons
Looking down on Newark, ankles bloody, I’m in Wonderland
Slammed through suburbs, into some curbs I lost one of my hands
Threw me in a silly cyclone, spitting up
Till my breath started to exhale, caught a plague to the chest
Threw me back to earth in pieces minus my spine, head
Why the fuck is Tame One shoveling me out the driveway
I like the nitro then go psycho with the lighter
When a billy-goat's head on a naked chick joins the cipher
My brain swells trying to escape its own package
Till it shatters the screen out of the TV with my skull fragments
Leaky packages secretly advocates of my demise
I see mad sliding eyeballs on an abacus
My walls bleeding, now the sky is red, two arms reaching
Through the floor, I’m aiming at this raven at my door tweaking
My lights are flickering, all my vision is different
Personalities I can’t even account for bickering
The scene’s dreamy, leave me this jar with a dead primey
When the juice is gone, I’ll ring his ass out on a pack of beanies
Hit the ceiling and stick inhaling the dip
Blow dust in my pit’s face, he shits, delirium hits
I start to time warp but crash into the wall funny
Look up and see Tame just took the blunt from me

[Verse 3: Tame One]
Now Newports can absorb enormous amounts of this liquid
We get sick with it, addicted to what the dip did to the misfits
Tsk tsk, we risk life and limb five to ten times daily
We scared to hit it but still distribute it fairly
Rarely sober but over the top with the rock
Just barely dropped but not to be shook like soda pop
Control dangerous substances, dust is nothing to fuck with
My different dutches corrupted like half of Rutgers, New Brunswick
Sick to my stomach, drugs in the hundreds lacing shit with
Nice twice on the mic is like the Matrix glitch
PCP me deeply, sinking into altered states
Fallen from grace, my blunts taste like chocolate shakes
I take over like J Hova to highjack your mental plain
Just for a layover then play the cut like baking soda
Spasmatic, another hip hop addict
With habits on National Geographic’s front cover fucking a fat bitch
