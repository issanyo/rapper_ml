[Verse 1: Cage]
Cut the feelings off
Get to peeling off
I won't leave until I see you wipe my semen off
Some girls are goin there
Cuz there's no one there
What I plant is in the trash
What are we growing here?
Feeling cavalier
Put some weed in the air
Cuz I was feenin here
There's fuckin demons near
Hit the car alarm
Then turn the Garmin on
Shes a treasure Dad
Shes fuckin garbage Mom

[Hook]
You don't know me
I don't know you
Get the fuck away from me won't you
You could feel like you know me
Just do it away from me won't you
And what you feel like
Are you lonely
Why are you lookin for your one and only
You could feel like you owe me
Just do it away from me won't you

[Verse 2]
High as a eagle is
Saw where the weasel lives
And when I open my wings
I'll show him what evil is
Wanna forsake it all
Don't care to break you all
Otherwise I'll cave in your ceiling and take it all
You can creep with the sheep and see where the pains end
And probably lose the container you got your brains in
Swag jackin off
She loves my catalog
More than some restaurants that Asians love the cat and dog

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
There's really nothin here
Why should I fuckin care
My ship sails fleet docks I'm a buccaneer
The whole you've fallen in
The one I'm crawlin in
Across the street watchin the fuckin cops call it in
One of the commondeer
Magic and ball in here
Got cut in half for a trick like my volunteer
Left you smiling there
That was the deep part
My only sweet heart made into street art

[Hook]
You don't know me
I don't know you
Get the fuck away from me won't you
You could feel like you know me
Just do it away from me won't you
And what you feel like
Are you lonely?
Why are you lookin for your one and only
You could feel like you owe me
Just do it away from me won't you
