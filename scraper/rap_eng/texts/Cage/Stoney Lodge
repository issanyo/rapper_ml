Man talking:
And this story just in from the wires of the Associated Press
The incidents of mental illness in the United States appears to be on the
Increase

*He's losing his mind!*

Strapped to the bed
Semi-conscious half in dead
Spit on the head-nurse and got rushed like I smacked a fed
Holdin' me down while the nurse brought me drugs
Took out the needle like Roc Raida and shot me up like Courtney Love
A fuckin' zombie on Haldol, look how I'm walkin'
Standin' around like crowd patrols in Boston
I'm running points, but the points not what my parents see
Demerit me? I pulled out my dick in group therapy
Dust the gorilla till they passed the Glock to Kong
And smacked around the ward and poured him a straight by Dr. Strong
Manic, depressed slashed chest keep a eye full
Sorry, we found Prozac makes my bipolars suicidal
No family visits add fuel
To the engine descending my fist on my stepdad's faggot face for attention
And when a tear comes in the room like, what's the matter?
I'm eating the brownies mom made then smacking her with the platter

[Chorus]
Sample:
*I wanna roll with the devil*

Cage talking in backround:
Nothing works here
I've been here for seven years
The medication don't work
Nothing works here
I've been here for seven years
I hate this place

I'm starting to adjust
Holding my dick to escape the lust
Till these girls in group, explain their rapes and bust
Switched to jeans
Conformness with a different theme
My performance to my parents deserves a zipper meet
And after a year when they ask me why I'm still here
I'm like, this shit is college for my fuckin' rap career
New bitch on the unit!
Fine, fuckin' her first
Put on suicide watch and jerk in front of the nurse
Molested bitch with tits that loves beatings
Doing ant hills of dope thinking it's coke at drug meetings
And when she starts to fucking seizure I'ma leave her
By the freezer while I'm taking breathers of ether with a fever
Jack the phone calling my friends fake faggots
Kicking the nurse in her tits when they throw me a straight jackets
That's what you get, dumb bitch, now you're crying pet
While I'm waiting for the drugs to kick in like a dying vet

[Chorus]
I'm getting desperate
I'm thinking my only exit
Was jerking off in medicine cups to get this bitch pregnant
I'm trying to make it through group with no jokes of shitting permitted
Try signing yourself out and not getting committed
My family sessions go great, with a slap to the mouth
And my stepdad's like, "You ain't coming back to the house!"
Look who's the better patient
I went to rape the nurse in the nurse's station
Broke in and took some medication
On Thanksgiving I stuck my dick in the turkey
And had the doctor on call play with my dick checking for herpes
Doctor is strange, swinging the open locks
Under a blanket while the whole unit tear me with soap and socks
A silent child, plotting the violent style
Talking to a rifle out loud like Private Pyle
Teen geek with a girl, looking to fuck but struck out
Holding my doctor hostage cause I can't get the fuck out

Man 1 talking:
It's horrible!
He's loosing his mind
That's the only explanation

Man 2:
He's gone berserk
The man is obviously a lunatic

Man 1:
Deprived that his actions can only be described as the ravings of a mad man

Woman X3:
The patient has shown no progress
The medication is not working

Man 2:
He's gone berserk
The man is obviously a lunatic

Woman:
The patient has shown no progress
