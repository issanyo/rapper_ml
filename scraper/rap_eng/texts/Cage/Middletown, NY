Straight outa Orange County
Give a fuck how chain stores found me
This is choice just so bitches and kids flock around me
Fuck discussion I'm the brink of bustin disgusting in the front of the club
With bullets lookin for suction
I count dough like enemies, even out the hood
See Cage with two Uzis, his paper must be good
Bitch sucked the nuts through the head of my dick
Walked slanted, then got two new mayonnaise jars implanted
Haters scapegoats with no plugs, could be legendary
But, stay too broke, and a client cemetery
Newburgh, shut it down
Middletown, run it now
BK, they commin out
Kingston Queens, running mouth
Ain't shit in Sullivan but gambling and AIDS
Only Monticello dogs run if shit is at the raceway
Your face spray out, two of these for the nine
Before there's Hells Winter there's Movies for the Blind

Middletown, New York, where I learned to walk and talk
All the biggest willys been killed or caught
You fucking with music you get no support
Even local athletes they think hand to hands a sport
I was raised on dirt weed and cheap liquor
Watch the same hand that shake mine go and peel off the sticker
The brand new album got hate more alive
Cause I shit on every MC in the 845

Must have been drugged in my sleep by agents sent to end it
Woke up underground with machines they can't wreck it
With a PCP method I smoke the dead's misery
Then rob the corpses to add insult to injury
My hand in the same evil that ????
Never seen so many fucking sons in a dark city
I bark witty
Pity no soundtrack to bust cops
So I push the envelope like 90's dust spots
Street clean up, put you best team up
Y'all crack dealers trying to rock with no re-up
In a sedan, or coup, or truck, it's buck a Trooper
State or local like it's yesterday, fuck the future
Christ like anarchist, games evolve
Get it, you want a clip but I came revolved
Them shitty, I need to add a Y to M City
Pen's gritty, ya'll titty, don't fuck with them kitty

Middletown, New York, where I learned to walk and talk
All the biggest willys been killed or caught
You fucking with music you get no support
Even local athletes they think hand to hands a sport
I was raised on dirt weed and cheap liquor
Watch the same hand that shake mine go and peel off the sticker
The brand new album got hate more alive
Cause I shit on every MC in the 845
