[Verse 1: Chino Moreno]
Why don’t you come out
Just wasting hours to call
And say...
No we're not gonna die!
Thoughts evolve
Shall we kill
A lot say
Tell them lies it's hard to play
And see my chest grow

For hours and hours and hours and safe for hours
The hours and hours and hours and hours...

Go tell
Wasting hours to talk
And say
No we’re not gonna stop!
Thoughts evolve
Shall we kill
A lot say
Tell them lies it's hard play
And see my chest grow

For hours and hours and hours and safe for hours
The hours and hours and hours and hours...

[Cage Kennylz]
Don’t let them take you alive!
The city knows my name, number and address
There's no where to hide!
[El-P]
You must all hear the merciful leader of big guns
Watching Gotti and television talk to your son
[Cage Kennylz]
Yeah 'least this plane isn't corporated
To a sickness that will not be infiltrated
When you slip this, then you'll see it's automated
Weathermen President will be inaugurated
[El-p]
And when tapped in the vein
Clapped back automatic a vein snap
But I just wanna boogie with a same plaque
Weathermen will bring the beast out of a Jukie freak
Some of these soldiers scream at the look of me
[Cage Kennylz]
While I sit back and..
Meditate on my medicated state of my rate
I can't wait to shoot frank and loot the bank
[El-p]
And uh, it's automated gang oughta take out the gator
Pulling prancin' on em' things and we breezing out of your brains some

For hours and hours and hours and safe for hours
The hours and hours and hours and hours...
