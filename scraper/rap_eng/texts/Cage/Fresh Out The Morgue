[Intro]
My man, my man from the morgue.. the morgue
Always hook me up!
Fill up that jar right there

[Cage]
Fresh out the morgue! dipped Newports in a corpse, rollie
Nah, this ain't a bottle of Stoli', I'm higher than Jeff Spicoli
Unholy, hope you got hands like the goalie, no need to cough him
'Cause Cage got balls of steel like The Tall Man (Boyyy!!)
You see the snakes transform, like Deceps' in Cobra
You wanna see Jehovah dump some of this Ketaset in your soda!
Somebody really needs to teach these babies!
Half of this throwback shit wasn't poppin' in the 80s!
If she in the mix, she gonna be in them flicks
You wanna start a revolution? stick a key in your kicks!
I'm laid back like the G.T.C post, put P.C.P most-ly
Induct, do you see chips with heat, that's Fri-tos
In this New Era of rap, I keep the fitted on my thinking cap
Anti-Freeze on the rocks, why you drinkin' that?
'Cause shit is hot and its the coolant, do you know what you doin'?
Apparently not, kiddies he's one of my students!
Drugstore, cowboy killer, no luck in crack rocks
The only canons they holdin' is buckin' snapshots
Too smart for prison, no felonies got me married
'Cause I'm only six months away from my license to carry
Gats for the rats, that scramble to find cheese
'Cause they Gucci and Louis all made by Chinese
W-E-A-T-H-E-R music
Women board in the morgue, record, then loose it!

[Outro]
What?
I'm goin' back to Stoney
Six months for Vay Cay
Let my balls re-energize!
All them dead baby milkshakes you clones is drinkin'
Now..
Mask Uno what up?
I'm in the rocks with the M21 Starlight Sniper Rifle
Can't see me what?
S.A. what up?
Yo we mixin' so yeah, mix that up
Nah, dip the whole pound!...
