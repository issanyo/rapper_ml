Deep into the future
I went as far and fast as I could
It was there at the edge of the infinite
On the precipice I stood
Show yourself to me I cried!
Have you nothing at all to say
Like no time ever before
He appeared without delay
At last he had finally come to me
To me finally he spoke
Although my power was nearly limitless
It was always his name that they invoked
Is this the end asked?
As the last of the galaxies fell into the void
His silent voice was all encompassing
Half amused and part annoyed You are the last to ask he said
And so I leave it up to you to decide
Then yes let this be the end
Let this be the end of it all I replied
I then watched as the last star flickered
Extinguished by the billowing black
As my consciousness gently faded
I knew nothing would ever come back
