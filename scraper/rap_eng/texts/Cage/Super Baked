[Intro]
So good to have you back sir
So good to have you back

[Verse 1]
Little kids flip out
Go eat a handful of acid
Then torch your mom's house
Havin' a cult is all guts and no glory
Especially when you throw yourself off of a cliff for me
What did I inhale
When will I prevail
I want to ditch this bitch's corpse and smoke out the hotel
Defile the scene with a dream
I no longer believe I invented it as a teen
Too many bitches to pound, I get anxiety
Like which one should I fuck tonight
Oh Alex
I clown, I can't even hold down my cowlick
While I kick-fuck the ballads
Wonder why I found so much joy in being horrible
Doing deplorable shit they find so adorable
I don't know if God gave me this brain
If he did, then there's a devil and he knows my name

[Verse 2]
Life is a coin flip, it's do or die love
Today's breakfast, tomorrow's suicide club
I should've rotted in a small town
Pumpin' dirt, lookin' hurt cuz I'm driving a fuckin' cab around
Probably still duckin' police
Probably still selling angel dust and noddin' off in the street
Kill me now if that's how my story ends
All we were was dust in the head, you lost yours in the wind
I'm super baked, but barely cooked, that means shits rare
Like it's out of thin air
Tell the firemen put the axes down, nobody's dying in here
We're just burning like a fire in here
For the Mayan year
Keep hatin', saying my name more than the bitch I'm datin'
We can't all be God's kids, some of us are Satans
And while you sit and ponder why your ass was put here
I understand why I am and waited 'til this year
