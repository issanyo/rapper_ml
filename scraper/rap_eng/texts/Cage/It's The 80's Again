[Verse 1]
I am a Mayan, I am Orion hunting lions
Not even trying, I’m lying, I’m just a guy addicted to flying
It’s magnanimous, overwhelming, unanimous
Decision to grow cannabis isn’t helping with Canada’s
Recent decision to be less critical, I take a little pull
Move to California using medicinal
I know I’ve done a lot, I think I’m gonna stop (Why?)
I’m just a guy getting stuck up for Jager, wanna cop

[Chorus]
We don’t know what we’re drinking
We don’t care what we’re paying
We have so much to say and we don’t know what we’re saying
You don’t know what I’m thinking, I don’t know what you’re saying
Maybe your phones are tapped and they know what we’re saying
Oh no, it’s the 80’s again
I wanna shave lines in my head
Oh no, it’s the 80’s again
The USSR is our friend

[Verse 2]
So last time around I went off the deep end
That winter weekend they took me away in my sheepskin
Was jumping around in a mirror with a hairbrush lip syncing
Said that I was drinking, my shirt was airbrushed
I wonder what my parents did with their aborted fun
And what these jeans look like with Jordan Ones
High school reunion, drunk at the auditorium
On eBay bidding on a DeLorean, why not?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don’t know where to go out west for tattoos
Who the fuck is into fluorescent track suits
Back in the 80’s they just liked it from the future and crazy
Now here’s the future, we’re just crazy and obsessed with the 80’s
A ninja suit, a Katana, a Madonna lookalike insane
Ripping a Volkswagen emblem of of a car for a chain
Make sure when you step outside and your skin singes
That your biological suit isn’t vintage

[Chorus]
