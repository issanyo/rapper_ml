Since the beginning, there has always been smut
God is smut, death is smut
Your girl is probably smut
Hip Hop is smut
And now, for your pleasure, all you dirty fucks
Smut Peddlers

[Cage]
See me on laserdisc fuckin your bitch
I-I-I, I coat my house in plastic cause I'm a health risk
My landlord tries to evict this
I fuck girls anally and then I'm on they shit list
No S&M cops could hold me
Gimmie twenty tapes and I'll gang bang your Dolby
Battery acid, splash the basket
Now she need reconstructive surgery
For all the non productive, citizens like organs
I live with a tec and Kiss the Girls like Morgan
Freeman, dusted fuck up ten He-men
Peeking, some'll still see bugs on me sleeping
Hibernate your whole state, incubate
Then I scrape off the abiotic fluids with a rake
I can't concentrate when I levitate, bong lakes
That's all your games when Raid stops on my brain scape

(Chorus)

For the record I'm a peddler
Of so many useful tools
Enough, you could never get of
Good hot, even better when it cools
We about to melt y'all nigga's cheddar
(x2)

[Mr. Eon]
The crafty from the master flee dastardly
Smut Peddlers, it has to be, who the hell's after me
It's Starbuck, you starstruck, I'm verbally charged up
With your hard luck your microphone is hard up
I got devout Christians enlistin for Mormon missions
Check the inscriptions, and visions, incisions
Cyclops beaming, cut a diamond with precision
Key to twistin a ???, roaches I be squishing
Addictions on scriptures, call it pet vices
You shit better than ?Glen Rice is Ted Nice's?
I'm buttery, auction my steez at Sotheby's
Jealousy, cause we be what others be
Now blessed be he who pack abstract apparatus
Rhyme with more attitude than B.A. Baracus
Flyin at night, writin the white lines
Your shit ain't workin like Slick Rick's right eye

(Chorus)

[Masai Bey]
Ayo, this ain't a rhyme, kid
It's a plug, for a ?cushite? product
That cleans more than Woolite
Other leading brands emit packages randomly to people
Study their reactions then scam 'em
For example ya, cheese crumb records
Six different flavors and guess what, they all cheddar
I can't believe the time and money that consumers waste
On a variety of the same exact taste
You phony rappers making music for the rich to dance to
Hope you can get into that circle
But if you want some light, go see Spieldberg
He could use some house, high class herb nigga
To freestyle about chaufferin him around
And can't wait to write about the Benz on his break
But this product's name is Masai Bey
And the ad was paid for by the most High

(Chorus)
