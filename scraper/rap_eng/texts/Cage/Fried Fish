[Cage]
Who got more verses than Bellview got nurses?
If some new info surface about The Weathermen, I did it on purpose
I got my company cracking, you luckily fuck with me back then
Chasing six figures this year...thanks for asking
Let's take a trip through Middle Town, MC's should quit and settle down
These brittle little clowns, lyrics so middle ground
Not breaking I'm taking it out, bitches go hide the kitty
Wanna rep where you live, you need to get a name outside your city
Not like nobody know you, go shoot your retarded son
You run with pussies and you ain't even the hardest one
Laugh at drug dealers that switch hustles that can't tell rap
Probably funnier than me quitting music to sell crack
Even though I'd still have fiends around the planet
At least across the Atlantic
Not the type to panic, hyper Xanax
I still see y'all snakes even through slips
Fucked a few chicks
I need that new doe like New York needs new Knicks
