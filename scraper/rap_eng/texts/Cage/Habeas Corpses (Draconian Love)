"I found love on a prison ship..." {X5}

"Number 247681-Z, step to the line"

[Gunshot]

[Verse 1: Cage]
Two types of people in this world to recognize
Conquered, and the one holding the rifle at the next in line
The crosshair in my eye is a vessel to god
The container that kept you around is in a hole in the yard

Sail the cemetery seas, half the crew leaves then move on
You have no idea how right my head is screwed on
When I wake up and put this suit on, I feel escape begin
Expirations are needed, I facilitate the end

[Verse 1: El-P]
There are two types of mornings/mournings in this life I can surmise
I wake early in the first to help supply the second type
Technician of repetition clips in the numbest of traditions its
The little wondrous blunders that can summon one's demise

I know the line to walk, talk softly, punch a clock, aim (pow) done
I see the shelter in contrition, best to limit wagging tongues
But today's a confrontation with a thought that's not assured
She's inching closer to my services and further from my world

[Hook]
"I found love on a prison ship..." {X8}

[Verse3: El-P & Cage]
Does this job ever bother you, darkly creep up in your conscious too?

[Cage]
Nope, in fact I'm so enamored with the standard
Of being handed a command to (pow), it's almost romantic
The lead giveth, I take it, if I didn't understand it

[El-P]
I'm saying during the tenure of your gig, have you ever herded a pris
Who despite the traitorous label, makes you nervous as a kid
Maybe beyond a date with the lead, there's something else meant for
A prisoner with the beauty of 247290-Z

[Cage]
Oh God, you gotta be joking, I get it she's smoking
Go get a taste, I'll hold you down for thirty, she must be purty, you're open
Your secret's safe with me, go on a raping spree
I gotta couple numbers of my own, just return the courtesy

[El-P]
No, nah man, that's actually not on my mind
Somehow its different this time. I mean
Should a creature so sublime and young really be in line for the gun
And am I the one to dispense it? She seems almost defenseless
And her eyes have the surprising effect of rendering me restless

You know, you look really pretty without handcuffs on
Without the dirt on your face...

Like the piss and stench of the huddled traitors evaporates from the room
And in that moment I can see her truly, and she can see me too
Beneath the body armor and weaponry, my heart quietly thumps and whispers
"Drop the guns and grab her, now's the time to make your run"

Sitting in my transport as we slip through traffic veins
She doesn't ask me where we're going, only holds my hand and gaze
She's my only reason now, and my only hope to live
We pull up to the cabin way above this damn metropolis

Me and prisoner 247290-Z
Somewhere that is Soylent Green, we're living life instead
No more war on traitorism, only me and her
She can clean my gun and I could help her clean the floor

Back to something natural, we'll live off of the land
When Radon levels drop we walk the trails and talk and laugh
I tell her she's innocent, and she'll show me she's not
I kiss the number on her arm and lay her on the cot

I'm the first to touch her without gloves on
She's the first to kiss me without crying
Life before this was just dying
Me and prisoner 247290-Z
Away from all this violence,live inside each other's heads... (X4)

"Number 247290-Zed, step to the line"

[Soldiers]
"Dammit Lindt, fire your weapon!"

"Yes sir"

[Gunshot]

"I found love on a prison ship..." [X7]

[Soldiers]
"She's dead Lindt, just how we wanted it. Great."
"Just how we wanted it (laughing)"
"You shot the shit out of her Lindt. I'm proud of you. Go home"
