[Verse 1: Cage]
We use the same planet
We breath the same air
We piss yellow and bleed red
We don't care
Worship the same sun until it falls in the sea
And the moon pops up to light up our debauchery
You wanna pave the way
I ain't tryin to follow
You think its really deep
Because you're fuckin hollow
You wanna be the king
I wanna overthrow one
I got grown man balls
You really need to grow some
You wear a lot of hoodies
I wear a lot of flannel
You wanna change the game
I wanna change the channel
You read what I've accomplished
I read a lot comics
I write a lot of music
You write a lot of comments
You sniff coke
I smoke weed
I get the munchies and pass out
You stay up with nose bleeds
I'm lookin forward to the future
While you hate it all
I wouldn't go back if I could
But you would trade it all

[Hook:] (x2)
I don't need a pot of gold
I just need a lot of dough
I just want to medicate, meditate and make it slow
I don't need a better way
You just need to find your own
Hell is ready that a way
I don't care I'm not alone

[Verse 2]
You can't handle your drugs
I'm better drunk than sober
The ones that say they love you are the first to fuck you over
You hate certain people
I don't discriminate
You're quick to get in line
I'm slow to assimilate
You got an angel lookin down on you while mine has fallen
So he looks up to me
Yours ignores you when you call him
You thought I gave you a hand so you could stab me in the back
Well there were too many knives in it for that
Too late to aim now
You set thoughts free, and then shot down
You were the shit in High school but you are not now
We took a hit of death
You started to suffocate
They put you in the ground
I told the devil he can fuckin wait

[Hook] (x2)
