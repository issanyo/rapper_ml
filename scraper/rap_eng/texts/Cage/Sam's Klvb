[Verse 1- Sam Hill]
I was adorned in a black clouded rain coat
Where I was spawned my mother was just a rape goat
All I feel is hate though
Lookin' through a faith hole
It was lookin' back at me
Showed me the burnin' lake
Koresh ain't got shit on me
What the fuck is Waco
Just a little town
I'm in every fuckin' state so
You see me go ape shit you don't want to see eight go
Get your Ouija
Tell the spirit world that I escaped crows
Shit out every piece of me
Some kid thought it was playdoh
Put me back together now I'm kickin' in the gates
So I could smack god in his face for takin' Tao
My head too big for a pussy or a halo

[Chorus]
I don't know if you're down baby
But I'm down
I got gasoline
Help me burn this church down
That Police station
Such a playground
Shoot that shit up 'til they lay down
If you think its crazy you should pray now
If you think I don't give a fuck about a church now
To me the earth all left on the way down
Soon as I get there I'll burn every church down

[Verse 2]
You're lookin' for diablo
He's waitin' at the morgue
Say hello to him for me when you get there
It is your day, Obey
Fuck 'em all
Let 'em sleep in
They need more pray
Tryin' not to freeze
They used to burn them down in Norway
In the house of God
I'm standin' there in the doorway
The pedophile came to take your kids to the orgy
No way anything in the bible means foreplay
The Pope of what?
To beat kid dicks into sorbet
One click of the staff onto the floor for gourmet
In a white castle with marble throughout the forey
Dressed like a Pharaoh in gold leaves so ornate
Pyromaniac like its my forte

[Chorus]
I don't know if you're down baby
But I'm down
I got gasoline
Help me burn this church down
That Police station
Such a playground
Shoot that shit up 'til they lay down
If you think its crazy you should pray now
If you think I don't give a fuck about a church now
To me the earth all left on the way down
Soon as I get there I'll burn every church down
