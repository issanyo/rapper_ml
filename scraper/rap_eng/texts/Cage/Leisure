[Intro]
But I do it at my leisure

[Chorus]
I do it at my leisure, I make it look easy
I do it at my leisure, you breddas can't see me
I do it at my leisure, I couldn't give a toss man
I do it at my leisure, cause I'm my own boss man

[Verse 1]
Everybody's chatting, I don't see nobody backing
I just see a lot of acting and I see a lot of slacking
Personally, I think the streets are lacking
Decency attack, cause there's no unity or honour among thieves
And that's a fact
Now everybody's hyping over crack and hyping over gats

[Chorus]
I do it at my leisure, I make it look easy
I do it at my leisure, you breddas can't see me
I do it at my leisure, I couldn't give a toss man
I do it at my leisure, cause I'm my own boss man

[Verse 2]
Get breddas always saying, 'Keep it real, keep it real'
Running around the street or running their mouth

[Chorus]
I do it at my leisure, I make it look easy
I do it at my leisure, you breddas can't see me
I do it at my leisure, I couldn't give a toss man
I do it at my leisure, cause I'm my own boss man

[Verse 3]
Don't need no rubber, dog, don't need no west-end club
Cheap scrub, tried to holler at me acting like it's love
Fake fucks, say they claiming blood, say they claiming crip
No rap sheet on their ear, lots of bullshit coming out their lips

[Chorus]
I do it at my leisure, I make it look easy
I do it at my leisure, you breddas can't see me
I do it at my leisure, I couldn't give a toss man
I do it at my leisure, cause I'm my own boss man
