A mouth full of pills, a noose around my neck
Memories of what you killed still pounding in my chest
A knife at my wrist and a gun up to my head
Destiny is slowly running out of breath

A mouth full of pills, a noose around my neck
Memories of what you killed still pounding in my chest
A knife at my wrist and a gun up to my head
Destiny is slowly running out of breath

[Cage Kennylz]
When you're alone in the house sometimes you start to trip
And memories you replay so much begin to skip
I get so tired of thinking through all these sullen glands
And throw myself on the rocks just trying to hold your hand
You get impatient like me just trying to deal with me
You took a shit on my art and said, "Its not MTV."
Your little corporate mind, so pretty for the kids
You have to get to agree with what your opinion is
The gun's down; talk. No intervention necessary
One foot in the cemetery, arm wrestles with death daily
The attempts to live vicariously through are buried
You could end your life with the cake knife the day you get married
How'd these pills get in my mouth?
Came home to God dead in my house
Sex on the couch as a teen was like catching a mouse
And I'm a worm in a bird's stomach dissolving
Funny how the sun fucks each planet, differently revolving

Chorus

Everything within this place still reminds me of you
I can even see your face while I'm tying my shoes
I confided in you and you tied up the noose
Lying to me through those eyes that I grew to love
But you know what? enough's enough
Because you fucked this up; you're such a slut
The foundation we built is falling to the ground
So face all your guilt stop stalling it right now
You don't care for me. Compassion? You barely seem to have it
Tearing seams on the mattress, I got the kerosene and matches
So I can burn it down to the ground like you should have done before
You should have shut the door, you stupid fucking whore
Don't choose to love me more when you ruined what we forged
Then threw it on the floor without any remorse
You spit on my part of this mess, ripped my heart out of my chest
Kiss the scars you laid to rest and sit far away from its death

Chorus

Chorus

Your ghost still haunts me in my sleep
Your scent still clawing at my sheets
You tore the drawing of our peace
Scorched the dawn we went to see
Still trying to clean up shards of my broken heart because what I need was lost inside of open arms
I fought and tried to show you our part of life would grow to bond, this harm is like a closing scar infected with memories
Depression is wearing me thin
Apparently this grim outlook adherently sticks until its tearing off my skin
An addiction that is living within

You can't even find the time just to sit and listen
Chasing pills with the liquor
The escape will seem quicker
This tastes a little bitter
This takes a skill that's bigger than rhyming on beats
Now our time is deceased
No more lying through your teeth
Its lying underneath what I called mine in some peace
Trying to increase its life with a please

Chorus
