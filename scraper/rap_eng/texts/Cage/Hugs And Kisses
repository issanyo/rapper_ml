[Verse 1]
Christ I lack passion or it may be relaxing
With substance abuse and disease looking for action
Flight is going down, I’m a passenger not the captain
A fraction of US marines, just went…
Souls hurting together, I’m one identity packing
Picked an ideology and was trapped in
Was sewn into the fabric of distraction
No different than a cow in the contraption
A hundred k today, just went

[Hook]
This is a memento, flying, drying that PETROL
Metro-Politans, line up get your espresso
Let’s go, open your head up and let THIS echo, “echo”
Taping my head up before it explodes
Drip drying, trying to get by on my cash
Death is in a mic I mean I’ll probably not last
My impression is set, no telling where you end though
If I write that note there’ll be no X-O’s, X-O’s

[Verse 2]
Your baby lady is maybe radioactive
Passively aggressive would be more attractive
You stay alive if you can afford to practice
If you live in the city getting bombed, you get..
I bet a vest
The guy that died is a vet
The guy alive is in debt
The cyanide is a net
Entire lives are in shit
We should all go see a flick
And be obsessed with the elite while the homeless eat

[Hook]
