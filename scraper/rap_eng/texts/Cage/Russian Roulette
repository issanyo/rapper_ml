[Verse 1: Sadistik]
I'm a victim of an over-active limbic system
Follow me and you will know the madness that I live in
No magic, just an open casket criticism
Carry me inside or you can bury me alive right
When we met it was innocent enough
I said "Hi, it's nice to meet you. I am Mister Self-Destruct
I'm in your blood you're a victim of the rush
But you're flirting with disaster when you kiss and tell my love
Make more beds of nails so you can stay warm
Sang chords in a medley 'til my face tore
Pray for living dead that walk and pace forth
Rain pours in my head, it's called a brainstorm
This game you're playing is so tedious
Black out on white lies and blame it on bulimia
Yea, now I'm saying all your secrets huh
Should've thought twice before you grazed with your demon's touch
No disrespect but the real love doesn't show
'til I kiss your neck and my steel tongue cuts your throat
I feel numb when the tears run uncontrolled
Like it's synthemesc and I steal some of your soul
Until the self-help starts
When you'd bite my heart to see if it was really made of gold
I extinguished flames until hell fell dark
And buried bodies under floorboards like Tell Tale Heart, so run

[Hook: Yes Alexander]
I will not watch you pray
As the steel shaft enters your brain
Tell me baby how many times
One thousand tries
You're still alive

[Verse 2: Cage]
I don't really think that I'm often ill
What would you wear to death a cross or nil
Should've known she was only out to fill
Some sort of void I was out to kill
Any time left was the sand that fell
Anything to keep me from standing still
Spend it like you happened to land a mil
Wake up throwing up random pills
You want to feel it under your bones in your marrow
You hope cupid ran off with more arrows
Better off in passage ways to find pharaohs
When the road you walk is too narrow
Start flying stop falling
Like you did when you first stopped crawling
Threw it all on the table and went all in
Cause I knew it had to be my calling

[Hook: Yes Alexander]
I will not watch you pray
As the steel shaft enters your brain
Tell me baby how many times
One thousand tries
You're still alive

[Sadistik]
Nothing's what it seems, life is but a dream
And I'm busy sleepwalking to find out what it means
