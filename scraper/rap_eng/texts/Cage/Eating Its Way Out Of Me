[Verse 1]
Feels like I’m walking the same road, you changed clothes
And cleaned yourself with each time you’re near, my head explodes
What lit the way was the light in my head
Now my batteries are dying, I’m almost dead
I try to take in what friends say but nothing helps
Why’s this monster trying to turn me into something else?
I sit around and wait, I guess we’ll find out
As beautiful as this hole is, I need to climb out

[Hook]
Cause you know that you mean so much to me
Even though you don’t give a fuck about me
And I saw it coming but I did nothing
Cause you know I don’t give a fuck about me

[Verse 2]
I’d like to switch but I can’t change like I rearranged
The furniture in my head now I’m just sitting strange
Everything is so distant, including the pain
I’d like to make it all go away but it’s too ingrained
I’m trying to stay afloat, picture a different end
But I can’t see the shoreline or which way to swim
Reopen the scab in my head that never healed right
I can say I’m happy, just don’t know what it feels like

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I’d like to say I can deal, will I escape duress?
When I can’t explain the scars on my arms and chest
See the abyss, I pucker up and give her a kiss
She holds me close and puts cigarettes out on my wrists
I’m just a bum-out who’s run out of lies truthfully
I guess there’s nothing that you or I could do for me
I got a list of prescriptions I should stay off
I guess my overdose either did the trick or was way off

[Hook x 2]
