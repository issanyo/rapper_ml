[Cage Verse 1]
Y'all fucked up, shoulda stuck me in ICU
Cause the type of shit that I'm on , when I see you...
Dollar fifty in your face, Tryin' to graze ya
The lead go in the bone and your face get stuck to my razor
Kick your shoulders from your head while you pleadin your case...
And the little girls you with like: "yo he's gonna eat his face!"
Pull out 2 nine's and an eight, two for killin' one for drillin'
Hold metal to your face if you think you're supervillain
Talk to women with sex and to God with a pistol
Fuck a married Mossberg, my barrel's stayin' single
With a pregnant pump I let shit jump out on the floor
See how it moves now I leave out with tools
I'll leave out the school of robots by the chorus
Like when I jumped off tour bus ran home and did more dust
Stick your hands up like the camera's upside down
And you got pussy in your lap and you goin' fuck right now

[Chorus: Camu Tao]
And if you wanna get freaky and nasty
We can make good in the back of the cabby
Come to daddy...
They wanna kill me in the club
Put slugs in my mug, player I don't give a fuck
Come to daddy...
These punks wanna jump
Come to daddy...
These chickens gettin drunk
Come to daddy...
You want me to put slugs in ya?
Come to daddy...
Ok...
Come to daddy...
What?
Come to daddy...

[Camu Tao Verse 1]
I fall in on that spot babe, I'm peepin' your game
Swivel table round that ass girl it's lookin real good
These lame frogs try to play ball, I'm used to the pitch
I'll put a screen on your dames body, scoopin' your bitch
So get played on that game called, losin' your shit
Come redecorate your crib fast, movin' your shit
I'm still peepin' out your dames ass, losin' the grip
On that neck head through the plate glass
Loose shoots in ya' wig
Yo, Cadillac STS, with some tamed hash
Tanqa Ray, grape fruit juice, stained glass
And I spend cash all night and clap off twice
And pack bongs tight and sip martini's fast
And get ass all night...
And I can come and choke you up let's all hear it
Tellin' me not to do it when I swing you from the terrace
Major pain to the establishment
Made famous in seconds...
Get props and guest spots on black plots like checkers...

[Chorus: Camu Tao]
And if you wanna get freaky and nasty
We can make good in the back of the cabby
Come to daddy...
They wanna kill me in the club
Put slugs in my mug, player I don't give a fuck
Come to daddy...
These punks wanna jump
Come to daddy...
These chickens gettin drunk
Come to daddy...
You want me to put slugs in ya?
Come to daddy...
Ok...
Come to daddy...
What?
Come to daddy...

[Cage Verse 2]
You can't take shit too far? You can't take it far enough!
You'd think Colin Powell came and A&R'ed us
Pull out like pre-aids in front of your girl scandalous shit
Take more strength out my finger to handle your chick
And when I leave I'll bet she'll be up on your shit list
The best knockers I've seen was on a Jehovah's Witness
So if you're trunk look good I'll run the Caddy
Til your chickens come to daddy now come with daddy...

[Camu Tao Verse 2]
Yo, some ecstasy pills a bag of dope I'll make you spazz out at the wheel
Makin' you smash into poles, get your head open then shatter your nose
And get them bitches open crackin' laughin' at holmes
Well it's on all up in the club Liberty City
With these stupid bitches sniffin' on kitty lickin' on titties
And the problem stops, after the collars pop
Roofies have you with some ugly bitches swallowing crotch

[Chorus: Camu Tao]
And if you wanna get freaky and nasty
We can make good in the back of the cabby
Come to daddy...
They wanna kill me in the club
Put slugs in my mug, player I don't give a fuck
Come to daddy...
These punks wanna jump
Come to daddy...
These chickens gettin drunk
Come to daddy...
You want me to put slugs in ya?
Come to daddy...
Ok...
Come to daddy...
What?
Come to daddy...
