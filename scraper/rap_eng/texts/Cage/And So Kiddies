[Verse 1: Cage]
I drink a bucket of paint
Watch my dick animate
Puke my guts out
Reveal a Poltergeist state
Now I'm inside out no need to hide out
Ain't made mistakes with paper since I sniffed the white out
Ink them, rip is a genius a genious, my stiching life seamless
Most like I dont exist to deem this
I reach the heavens from my nights
Plug mics in satellites, scream
"Somebody get me off this fucking planet tonight!"
When I wig out like salons, I'm calmed by sick flicks
Got the staple gun for if your train of thought splits
And it's so unchristian the way I'm blisterin'
Tired rhyme styles from Detroit Michelin
Who's that trim lady?
Claimin some other nigga baby
While her bitch royce roll for her bitch voice faggs the math after moist
My hollywood writa'
Thought b-boy stood for bitta'

[Hook-mixed]

[verse 2: Cage]
Snatchin' gutty butts with slang from Clockwork
Plus, my insects spects make me look like a gray
Running through livestock cattle mutilate for BK
Visit crop circles since clubs ain't fresh
When I'm wildin' like Scott picking up agent LES
The forceps in your chest try to pull out karma
Who walked away with a smokin' tool and a rottweiler parma
I made it out this life with warm breath
Leave a two a still bar crawl back in for hill prawn
Never call me son since my name Alex Starr
I smack emcees with the Lincoln town car
Bite your tongue off before you sound simila'
And don't need no bitch box after Cage stick his Jim in her

[verse 3: Cage]
Stay off the streets or get snuffed by worm kings
They pull you underground a million feet and start circlin'
Then blast!
Cage peels scalps rip out pulp
Recruiters on your block from the Agent Orange cult
Hung the illest cats from the highest lamppost
Gave the sickest dogs, cement Timbs to guard the coast
I don't hear nothing polly in visions
With shamans, electrocuted Carmen with a bead of almonds
Bully gets gonest make shit kicks some of that addict
I kill mad tricks and I don't know magic
I start tactics with speed bumps
And then snort it
See four big trucks with chains
You drawn and quartered
