[Verse 1]
There is no medication to cure me I'm mental patient
I'm sorry you had to see me this way but the frustration
Killing me in the morning more than the evening more in the morning
Cuz when I wake up it doesn't leave me
It's not a dream when I look in the mirror my enemy isn't staring at me
Though I'm stuck with his memory
I guess I should just say it and stop trying to tell you...
OK there's something I have to tell you...

[Hook]
I was a fat guy!
I was a big fat guy!
I was a fat guy!
It's no wonder I stayed inside!

[Verse 2]
This is nothing to kick dirt on
If you're thin you get your flirt on
When your fat you make love with your shirt on
I'm dying to hide yellow inside you can't hurt me
I'm already being myself up at 230
I could miss a lunch switched from cap'n crunch to wheaties
Being such a high risk for diabetes
If the fantasy in my head could see the day
I would jump around and run to my ex and say...

[Hook]
I was a fat guy!
I was a big fat guy!
I was a fat guy!
And now I'm truly alive!
I was a fat guy!
Why was I so ugly inside?
I was a fat guy!
I'm so happy I could just die!

[Verse 3]
I just wanted to lose some weight you know
And drop a couple of LB's
Maybe drop a few pants sizes
Get the fat snaked from around my heart
And clean out my arteries
I remember I was watching Fight Club with my ex-girlfriend
And the part came up where he had bitch tits and she laughed!
And I had bitch tits, so that means she was really laughing at me
I was just tired of feeling like shit you know?
I figured if i lost the weight I might not feel like shit any more
But guess what I still feel like shit!
They say you are what you eat
That means I went from shit to a vegetable
And the worst part about it is
I was happier when I was fat and on drugs
I went from fantasizing about women
To fantasizing about food I can't eat anymore
