If you get the chance to lay on the beach next to a peach
In a bikini, she’s calling you from the reef
You could lie there, die there, just experience being there
Feel like a millionaire just breathing air
Until you find out the girl you’ve taken
The one that you’re in love with on vacation’s forsaken
Paradise New Year’s Eve with cameras storing pics
I’m more in fix with 2004 than 2 or 4 or 6
Dead in the water from cover, I start to wonder
If the fish can smell a wound the sharks may take me under
He defeated the loser flying home coach of course
It’s written on her face she’ll repeat from my high horse

She said I suck and I'll be crying
I say, well better that than what you dying
I think there’s so much ? that you’re trying
You know what, you never mind then
You never mind then

She picked me up from the train station, we had a talk
If she didn’t pick me up I’d cab it or have to walk
No vehicle, no account balance, I felt the silence
In the car a pixie becomes a vulture with throat talons
Fangs past her lips on her belly like a cobra
Trying to bite a werewolf with a mongoose on his shoulder
Not thinkin' of gettin' older, cracking open a chemical soda
Pulled in my driveway, she said it’s over
Love drunk and sober, have to go and get different socks
Stained with blood through my shoes, how hard I’m kicking rocks
Pain is nothing, you feel like Jesus of Nazareth
Shocked that you could drown in so much shallowness

I say good luck, I hope you find it
She said I hate you, you’re so absent-minded
I said one day you’ll wish you can rewind this
You can’t so never mind then
You never mind then
She said I suck and I'll be crying
I say, well better that than what you dying
You said you’ve only dug a plot to lie in
You know what, you never mind then
You never mind then

Face down in the water thinking fuck this place
Just promise that you’ll leave me
I always knew you’d leave me
Face down in the water thinking fuck this place
Just promise that you’ll leave me
I always knew you’d leave me
