[Verse 1: Cage]
CK Won, tell ya mom this shits done
Got a brand new album for a fucked up son
Her daughter gettin fucked, like I give a shit tricker
Go eat that acid off'a them explicit warning stickers
Lickin the cd, askin ya mom to buy it
While I'm gagging honey, in the hyatt with my dick to keep her quiet
"Room service..." Fuck that! Assume Nervous
Break this bitch ass off a bruised purpose
In and out throw a fist in the route this bitch has waste management 'cause I piss in her mouth
Match made of guinness for forty five minutes
Then I'm breakin' my foot off her ass for the finish
Look dingy in Fendi but trendy
Millenium Ted Bundy lookin all friendly at Wendy's
'Cause it's time to eat and I'll fuck you up I ain't them rhymin' geeks

[Chorus x2: Copywrite]
We want pussy, money and I'm ready for war
Already I'm tore still I'm gettin head from your whore
Bring the fun on don't be the we put a gun on
Promoters that don't gimmie our dough are gettin' swung on

[Verse 2: Cage]
I can't help that your wife likes sex and the violence
Got knives to her head while I paint eyelids
Then cut my ear off Smirnoff get the dead deer off
Then have that bitch get Lon Ser off
Then we laugh about it at whatever clubs poppin'
And blow this shit up with all the whores and thugs locked in
Make it a point to then break in the joint
Spend a clip on cult members outside waitin' to join
I'm gettin' this money I don't care how it look
If I pick up both arms you're watchin' a coward cook
Riddled with lead d-cup nipple tip of the egg
Twelve four watchin' cops itchin' their head
Sippin' grey goose with a trey deuce
On this kid that runnin' this dough and I'm like 'lay loose'
Don't have your moms be like, 'That's my boy!'
Then go sign the papers to have your corpse destroyed

[Chorus x2: Copywrite]
We want pussy, money and I'm ready for war
Already I'm tore still I'm gettin head from your whore
Bring the fun on don't be the we put a gun on
Promoters that don't gimmie our dough are gettin' swung on

[Verse 3: Cage]
You better got rocks to fling or Glocks to ping
Fuck around and got Cage doin' obnoxious things
Now it's four AM where your kids at Larry Clarke's crib
With Copywrite next to where the PTA live
Went to see Bully not for my two songs maybe up
Cameo with Bijou Phillips lady up
This time around crazy I'm slicin' shook rookies
Used to pistol whip 'til Shady made it look pussy
Tryin' to dissect words I write
Only found a napkin in the diner for the verse I wrote last night
So don't pick up bread crumbs
Like this old bitch sittin' shoddy in the NIS gun
You get the point like your bitch do
I punch through the planet like when PCP hits you
Watch me shake up these little prima donnas
Cuttin' off their backpacks like Mad Cow Llama

[Chorus x2: Copywrite]
We want pussy, money and I'm ready for war
Already I'm tore still I'm gettin head from your whore
Bring the fun on don't be the we put a gun on
Promoters that don't gimmie our dough are gettin' swung on
