[Verse 1: Cage]
Fuck I just died, so tragic
Shes a whack game with some dope graphics
Regular as fuck in your quest not to be savage
Climbing over friends in your pursuit not to be average
When I'm gone
Will a group of people drink to me
When you look back is it what you'd think it Be
If you jump to your death then you probably know
God's a lonely mother fucker so you gotta go

[Hook]
Everyday people die in this place
Maybe it was you who shoulda died in his place
Make some room for you to occupy in this space
Everything you lose you can try to replace
Don't contribute shit and then rely on this place
Maybe it was you who shoulda died in his place
We don't give a fuck when we defy in this place
Maybe it was me who shoulda died in his place

[Verse 2]
Its hard to reconnect, being ideally far
From yourself because you hated who you really are
Let it catch fire, wasn't frightened by the spark
Let it Burn out, I can see
I was enlightened in the dark
I let a bunch of Armies
Took the weed and fuckin pharmies
In your city sellin tickets
Like a bunch of Carnies
I know what time it is, there's none left to borrow
That's why I live every night like I'll be dead tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Evil on me like a pit trying to fight a collie
They either thought I was a
Cop or too white to Poly
Playing tricks on my self really to spite the folly
Right to molly, home alone doing heroine like Macaulay
Separated from myself for the night again
Ice water pulling Tylenol out of the Vicodin
I can't believe I made it out with so little damage
Back then I thought Cold Turkey was a fuckin sandwich

[Hook]
Everyday people die in this place
Maybe it was you who shoulda died in his place
Make some new room occupying this space
Everything you lose you can try to replace
Don't contribute shit and then rely on this place
I think it was you who shoulda died in his place
We don't give a fuck when we defy in this place
Maybe it was me who shoulda died in his place
