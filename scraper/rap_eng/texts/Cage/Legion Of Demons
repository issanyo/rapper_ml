Up from his kingdom of fire his legions come swarming
Unholy warriors cry, a dark day is dawning
Crushing the snow and the ice, they stand by the millions
Dealing with the devil's device, they'll bring his dominion

They come without warning, the ending is near
They blacken the light of the sun
They fall from the sky making men disappear
Blasting their hellfire guns

Send forth the legion - Breaking the seal
Legion - Lightning and steel
Legion...
Legion of demons
The legions of demons

Now go - Up from below - Nothing shall stop you

Wicked savior - Savior of the wicked

Laser eyes, locusts they fly they'll burn every nation
No one will be left alive - The first revelation

They come without warning, the ending is near
They blacken the light of the sun
They fall from the sky making men disappear
Blasting their hellfire guns

Send forth the legion - Breaking the seal
Legion - Lightning and steel
Legion...
Legion of demons
The legions of demons

Divide - Take none alive - Show them no mercy

Wicked savior - Savior of the wicked

Prepare for revelation, destroy and divide
Take all the unbelievers and bathe them in hellfire
This sinful world of man is mine to conquer and slay
With my evil revolution the light will die today
Take them, make them all mine !

Evil revolution
Satan's retribution

Demonic invasion
Total devastation
Mankind's armies falling
Revelation calling
Legions of demons are taking your souls !

Two billions lives have been lost, the legions devour
Nothing can stop their attack, it's man's final hour

They come without warning, the ending is near
They blacken the light of the sun
They fall from the sky making men disappear
Blasting their hellfire guns

Send forth the legion - Breaking the seal
Legion - Lightning and steel
Legion...
Legion of demons
The legions of demons

Yes - My power protects you - Their weapons are useless

Wicked savior - Savior of the wicked

Deadly recreation
Evil coronation
Hopeless situation
