Massage parlor hoes don't ask to get ransacked
They ask for signatures for where they should put their hands at
Yeah! That feels nice baby give it a better squeeze
Wait til' she clean up, go to my locker, pull out the berretta "Freeze!"
The brains was nice, I aims precise
Then I pulled a necklace out that'll change your life
We both know what you doin is against the law
So put your panties back on and fix your bra
When I pick you up tomorrow there'll be no resistance
Cause I got a lot of clients and they need assistance

[Camu Tao]
Hold up hoes, yo, ready to go
To the courthouse and now I guess you ready to blow
If you don't give up them draws, I breakin you slow
And start breakin some laws, start breakin your jaw
What up bitch?
Yea you same ol' shit
Bad Lieutenant where feds stay issues clips

[Hook: Cage]
Come on, let's go stick a wheelie up
Pick his jewelry up
Nah, Let's go pick a cherrie up
One or Three pair em' up
Bitches, stick your titties up
Hooker, look a giddy up
Look a little pretty but you know I keep the city up
Roll a bag of eddie up
No Henny or any tucked
Til' you gotta go and the dough is in your panties butt
Haters, we're already up
Nighthawks steady cut
Every pile of shit tryin to stick his 9 milli up

[Camu Tao]
Please, we know her rights
Fleein from vice
We do T's on amphetamines
Speedin' thru lights
Hookers in the backseat
Weeded, bleedin and cryin
I love bitches in the street, lookin like hard workers
Pull up with the badge, pull out the dick, they start jerkin
When crackhead hoes start jerkin, feed 'em with a fix
Beat 'em with a stick
Rookie, heat 'em with a six
And take them hoes to central booking and make them give you pussy
Take some pictures for me and smack some bitches for me
And make them workers know
You can't wait to hurt them hoes

[Cage]
Serpico got a clean shave
15 babes in the pattywagon, daddy mackin with his teen slave
Hit the streets and then the dough hit my fist
And if the bitch don't hit the streets, then I hit the bitch
And if the street hit the bitch
I go back to puff in the bar
While a John's with this bitchass stuffed in the car

[Cage]
Is it entrapment, when my cock got in traffic
Askin a prosty, a price on blowin catholics
On bash, N-H is mackin these codes
Im like the I-R-A, kneecappin these hoes
Keep slappin these poles
With these tits you call hookers
If she gains Two pounds, I'll take her downtown to book her
Look my clients aren't lookin for no burn in the inches
Stop cryin, I didn't make you eat sperm for a livin
Should of learned from the sick
And could've studied again
But you learned from a ho and now get money from head

[Camu Tao]
Cause these D.T's, can make the D.A, D.O.A
So we leave scene, with free cheese and we go play
Most these hoes in these mean streets ease cocaine
Dirty up these hookers paperwork to freeze those names
Snort coke, relax just to skeeze those dames
Free pussy for the deckers that can ease their pain
