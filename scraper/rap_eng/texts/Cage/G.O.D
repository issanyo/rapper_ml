Your time has run out, scum
God have mercy on your dirty soul
So you must die

[Cage]
I'm draggin my brain through the mud
Spillin blue blood, pull a filter out you love
Bottles stashed in these finger in my two gloves
A few tubs, filled with that shit that turn you killer
Adrenaline gland under my tounge, ripped out a gorilla brain
Still insane, but I feel the pain better
Too fucked up off this Jesus piss to get my shit together
In a fog, in Prague, reluctantly I've grown zero
Each one of my nerve endings switching with my bonemarrow
The scenery surrounding me isn't really reality
Atleast that's what I tell myself to get it out of me
The quest to find my inner uglyness is over
The secret to my failure is easier than being sober
If my self loathing hatred killing your high yet
Just cop the bundle, dude was like "I don't know how you didn't die yet"
I'm immortal with water, I'm borderline, this border nine
I'm painting pop art with a fucking bucket of corporate minds

[Cage]
If evil decides today he left her sucking on the guns
She put what she thought on the wall and left her tounge
These secrecy I say want crunches to come
No digits to dig, is she to cookin with nowhere to run
Son a, Senator dies today, he put too much in the blunt
They left him leaking on the floor with liquid in his lungs
I'm stuck with these lies to say
Why bring a daughter or son into a planet
That you paying to drink the water from

[Tame One]
Sherming like Nutty Professor flicks
With the most toxic narcotics
I'm like Keith Murray, illiotic with product
Leak like security breaches
With reefers you smell from long distance
The wet takes the breath of strong-windeds
I never intended to recommend the sins we doing
But people already assuming I'm high as Witney Houston
Accumulated more dust than maids and a butler
Fuck a broom, you need mops to sop up in my rubber room
Bring in the pain, I sing in the rain like Gene Kelly
In between tellys, puffin Listerine jelly
With smelly drugs, mentally bugged, high as I ever been
Peer pressuring, weird specimens with adrenaline
Hostile for days, needing hospital stays
To dry my skeleton, after what's in my system settles in
I fake my own death to get wet, leaking effect
Because I'm good for putting water on weed like Chia Pets

When the madness stops I be approximately open
Lead the horse to water, can't get him to drink it, but smoke it
Am I leading these kids straight to hell? I'm thinking probably
In oddity, not to be listen to outside this odyssey
This album's like a fish, pissing when it's captured
I guess that means it's gonna leak on the net when it's mastered
Hence the title that the guardians of death damned it
That's G.O.D for PCP made from where angels landed

[Tame One]
Let me speak up for the leaked up savages
Time travellers, characters turned over
Blunt soaking sherm doners
The water on the brain long term damage that manage to maintain
Polluted by the purple rain stain
My name's anonymous with embalming a sticky wet
Keeping it fair for the squares that's a dipped cigarette
Biohazardous, blasphemous, angel dust dutches to smoke
With a dubble package like how they do rappers out on Interscope
