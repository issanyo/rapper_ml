Our nation must come together to unite
I know that human beings and fish can coexist peacefully
Nobody needs to tell me what I believe
But I do need somebody to tell me where Kosovo is
The illiteracy level of our children are appalling

I wake up to a caffeine cigarette vaccine and bathe in water I wouldn't drink before gasoline
Feel like a loser because I'm not in Fallujah
Paintin' a Land Cruiser with an Iraqi then taking his ruger
No M-16 to gimme a callus inhuman super malice
For GOP Uber Alles
Baby suicide bombers hurdle suitcases in the nursery
I'm in a deli eatin' tuna tasting the mercury
Then wash it down with a two dollar bottle of water
Get on the train and think of Terrorists with box cutters
Gun concealer cuz I see a realer reality
And what I breathe through my nasal cavities killin' my batteries
Bombs in metropolis out all eye sockets
Esaphagus melted out some Shi'ite group will get their props for this look
I need petro for my Mercedes
But I'm not going to trying to kneel or bow for Emperor Cheney (NO)
Maybe I'm crazy but I will not just follow the herd
Unless of course it's enroute to lynch Mike Bloomberg
Being pimped by a gas pump and all it's Saudi members
Are like 'fuck you' with New York's two middle fingers
If the opposite of pro is a con then look beyond this
The opposite of congress must be progress
Wat the second coming's aborted and put in the dirt
I still don't know what to wear with this orange alert!

I was proud the other day when both republicans and democrats
Stood with me in the Rose Garden to announce their support
For a clearer statement of purpose: you disarm, or we will!

American flags fly morals high
A unit of twenty or so repelling from apaches in the sky
Into a village of killers little Jimmy from Jackson
Mississippi just graduated and seeing action
M-16 locked loaded and spitting properly
Whoever's in that line of fire chest full of democracy
Turn the corner team leader neck up to nose gone
Blown off this is not PS2's SOCCOM
Jimmy stays so calm shoots count nothin'
Riddled in his back answers come flying out his stomach
Face down then face up in a bed almost dead
Eyes slowly open I.V. bag and no legs
A couple of sandwiches some bloody bandages
In a room full of amputee G.I. amateurs
He gets the word that his unit didn't make it
Got a free ticket home but flat lined before he got to take it

We're certain there are people that can't stand what America stands for
We're certain there are madmen in this world
And there's terror, and there's missiles
And I'm certain of this too

Cops tape up the scene gunner downs nine
They're chasing away kids playin' hop-scotch in his chalk outline
Two F-16s screech an iridescent sky
Look down we're not in Iraq we're in NY
Rats in the streets we move underground like earthworms
Two coasts couldn't abort Satan in his first term
The army in the subway walkin' with toolies
I'm on the train with the back of the dollar bill still talking to me
Drive with my left I know my whats right my weapon hand
Like the maps of DC streets still show a pentagram
License on the car window when I pass through
You've seen the news no joke the New York pig department will blast you
My Weatherman party is invite only soldier
Cuz with one wave a King G DUB's scepter it's over
The right to assemble puts the bureau's team on you
Look into my file and nod to this while Jello screams on you!

By our efforts we have lit a fire in the minds of men
It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress
And one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world
It is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth
Of democratic movements and institutions in every nature and culture
With the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world
Except right here at home
Yee-Haw!
Don't mess with Texas
Don't mess with Texas
Don't mess with Texas
Don't mess with Texas
Connie, Connie, give me some pretzels
Rummy, Rummy, give me that bible
Give me that bible with the pages cut out and it got that cocaine in it
C'mon, c'mon, don't mess with Texas
I'll fuck anything that moves!
