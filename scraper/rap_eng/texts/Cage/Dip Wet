[Verse 1: Tame One]
Weathermen Doppler radar
Accurate forecast from the trainyard
From the almost famous but I ain't large
That's the medium
Encyclopedia Brown is here with me again
Foreign power God like "this must be the ten"
You'll get fucked up and wetted for production credit
And standing too close to the edge to try and end it
This the daredevil man without fear over here
So fucked up I try to drink weed and smoke beer
Great date making a tape
Iller than everything in this milk crate
Sicker than the stick that's in the pill case
Coke or base smoking an eighth
Guess who's back
With [?] for construction [?]
And popping off with caps
It's the b-boy Captain Troy
Drug store cowboy
Nuts over the coco like this was Almond Joy
Mad dogs want it [?]
Grab a redhead from out the basement
Don't get it twisted, I got it braided
Rated R, ghetto star, Boom Skwad pres with the jars
Like D-12 Bizarre with at least 8 bars
We move by with the green destiny sword
I get high when I record
Sober, tape over jokers when I be bored
Word bond, after we doing these songs and skits
Push up in a strong bitch after an Eastern Conference performance
Meet the blade shark, trademark
The beaties and some Nikes, and a 5-pack of 3X white tees
I'm the Ol' Dirty Bastard uncut, tip wet

[Hook: Cage & Tame One]
Oh look your chick's wet
Dip wet
Oh look your chick's wet
We going dip wet, dip wet, dip wet, dip wet, dip

[Verse 2: Cage]
Leak brother from another mother box cutter
Butter discover I ain't missing it
So gutter I could jacuzz in my own piss and shit
No move is subtle
Got a clip for you to cuddle fag
Feet, hands and head will get stuffed in a duffel bag
Tits, you ain't got enough to grab
First day out the pussy it was "blow me mom and fuck you dad"
High school to the hospital, hospital to me in the shelf
I'm so real Chris Palko can't even be hisself
Who the fuck wanna lead sheep all day, I'll head beneath them
After I'm coppin' a bag like a dead policeman
I go ape shit like digested bananas
In a world infested with cameras, y'all just flesh for piranhas
You want my spot, I abandoned my vehicle
Record labels are like bitches and none want to be with you
Gun in my face I hope you don't expect me to panic
I gave up on suicide y'all have to take me off this planet
Weathermen pop out like a great white's jaws when it's snacking
I'll break your rib cage and ask you what the fuck's cracking
This Camp Blood, y'all get more than a bear hug
I'll shit on your dreams and wipe my ass on your prayer rug
Don't try to come at me, you too righteous to know me
Middletown rappers that ain't with EST can blow me
