[Verse 1]
When I first wake I administer the usual morning walk through death
No sense in abusing your lungs with pepper I go straight for a high grade phencyclidine with all the extras
Then I like to open the walls in the house and since it's never mine I start immediately
I can destroy an entire upstairs six bedroom penthouse in under 15 minutes
And after this one I'll be up to a thousand
For a rush some jump from planes or fly them into builidngs
I blackmail the wives of broadcast Gods
And every quarter moon it seems the situation asks for a bit of the old 'demolition'
Since none of you can see I won't waste your time with special effects
For these are the hateful and shermed out adventures of a child that dared defy a conformist lifestyle...
