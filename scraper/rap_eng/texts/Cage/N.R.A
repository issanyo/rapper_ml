[Verse 1: Cage]
Sunny day, fuck a money day this is murda
Oh you fucks wanna play with my money? Lets hit your bird up
First, burst Kenny for roamin' with Denny
Shot Tommy in the back while he was boning Jenny
Had to kill this bitch cause she like to run her mouth
And I ain't got time to shoot off her arms and cut her tongue out
With Timmy flexin' and his chest, legs and hips up
Felt bad to kill 'em just some kid mixed up

[Verse 2: Camu]
Nah, seen 'em in the hospital getting his belly stitched up
So I finished the job put 6 through his bitch cut
When the I.D's proper, I slip her like doctors
Jump in the service elevator switching the coppers
Cause it's a thug thing
Yall nigga wanna cut 'caine
At the D.A's office hookers wanna hug brains
And if you wanna step with your turn
Your chest'll get burned
I serve and protect what's mine and your set'll get turned

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Camu]
I gotta 44 mag and stock that'll blow you to pieces
And have your holding your jesus and holding your keys up
Ducking from c4s and cannons holding your needs up
Special unit task force roll up in three trucks
They roll up on a payroll ready to seize stuff
C'mon dog this is your sole purpose
Clowning nigga's like a universal soul circus
The word on the street is you a herb you a cheat

[Verse 4: Cage]
You'd rather be stuck in a house with Mike Myers
Shoot up bike tires
Try the merc
Take the work
I hope you like fires
Streets fiend for blood
So I feed it thugs
When the shit comes back that's what we feed the judge
The D.A drank the piss when the block resist
Give you a Glock to kiss you like "What kinda cop is this?"
Have the warrants to kick down doors
Stick My dick down whores
Then I'mma kick down yours

[Hook]
We stock guns

And let 'em know

[Verse 5: Cage]
Fuck who you telling, I played the games
So I showed you a few cards I'm like David Blaine
And I stayed with caine 'til I got the dust water running
Took the heat off the streets just to keep the orders coming
And this how they repay me by trying to play me
And they look happy and dead while they smile in gravy
Bitch bring out your baby you know your whole camp is dead
Gimme the dope and the kid's coke

[Verse 6: Camu]
I've been on the force for six months
Of course I'm sick nigga
Of course I hit blunts
Snort coke
Count dough in customs
Any rookie that don't wanna follow we fuck them
Any dealer that don't wanna turn, we bust them
And turn in the state evidence cop tail your residence
You fucking with the long arm of the law
We don't read rights keep them streets tight
Speeding through them street lights it's a leet life

[Hook]
