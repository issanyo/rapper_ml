[Verse 1: Cage]
I'm clinically diagnosed, so mimic close
Toast Mighty Mi for supporting my drug habits when I'm out of dope
You wanna see where the rabbit hole ends up?
Pills, deepen when it nails first, whats up with your girlfriends guts, uh
Weathermen associate, Worm Kings more appropriate
Collapse the mic, smoked out, tabs are soaking wet
Waiting 'til I come down to flick the lights on
And watch the little spiny back bone puncture my writing arm
Eject from my palm, attack the pen
Open you with the sharpest compositions, and then play it on your organs
After the false mathematics of tragic habits
From your scattered body parts, and then divide your thinking fragments!
The sum is your rhymin' average
And who the fuck you lookin' for when your only squad is your adlibs?
Ripped out your speaking passage with salad tongs
Don't give a fuck if my joint sold out like Stretch Armstrong!

[Hook: Camu Tao x2]
Renegade, cutthroat, Dust Vs. Ecstasy!
Step into wall, space, you fought the equilibrium
Your outer reach is reaching out to mute your speech
The mutant freak! Death to all stars for all eternity

[Verse 2: Cage]
Throwing triple six in your rhymes, and you ain't Satan's dogs
Got a head full of Jesus to guide me to where the leak is
While I freak this mormon how fuckin' boring this scores been
Drug dealers camped out side of my house is doormen
Fuck all these happy drugs I'm lookin' for this relapse
Get pushed in the face 'til the back of your heads a ski mask
Run up in Fat Beats with a gun 'cause I got shit to plug
You want a bug? Pull my exoskeleton
Peel my pectoral back reveal a pound of beating mescaline
Effective when, the worms crawl in then bleed out!
'Cause the minute any girl dies shes getting eat out
Fuckin' with a pistol in your mouths the only peace route
If you find a better exit, show me that piss box
Stuff a dozen infants in a Ziploc for a dirty wrist watch
Slice my arm, squeeze my palm, over the crowd to calm
Nerves while I craft words like skin into uniforms

[Hook: Camu Tao x2]
Renegade, cutthroat, Dust Vs. Ecstasy!
Step into wall, space, you fought the equilibrium
Your outer reach is reaching out to mute your speech
The mutant freak! Death to all stars for all eternity
