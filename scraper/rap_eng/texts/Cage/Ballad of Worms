I can`t get that sound you make out of my head
I can`t even figure out what`s making it

What kind of God is this?
Gave me the hottest bitch
Then took the life from her chest and left a pile of shit
Sloppy with a fork, so Chris gotta feed her
To numb to cum, sometimes she piss while I eat her
I tell her, keep her head up
Even though I gotta hold it up for her
And she seizure when she try and get up
I know I'm irking her
But can't stop what's hurting her
No sleep with her screaming all night, I'm thinking of murking her
Her parents paid for the coffin and left state
After signing the contract, do not resuscitate
Yellin' for mommy
I dip in the morphine to calm me
I'm known in town as the creep that's into zombies

[Hook x2]
I can't get that sound you make out of my head
I can't even figure out what's making it

Stare in her eyes to look past horror
Morphine tolerated, I'm out coppin' horse tranq for her
Like I won't have to go through hell again
Her skin is like saran wrap, barely hangin' from her skeleton
With each one of her ribs defined
My crib's designed
To keep the light out cause she can't lift the blinds
Drifting behind, I'll be outta friends soon
Nobody visits the guy that keeps the body in his bedroom
She's barely alive and taking life from me
With no appetite but the meningitis is still hungry
Wants to make love
But I had to substitute it with holding hands while we take drugs

[Hook]

She's cold as a corpse
And still holding The Source
Up in the air like: "One day the cover is yours"
Took the IV out her wrist
Tried to give me a kiss
Before I tasted her lips, she dislocated her hips
Started shaking
Couldn't feed her no medication
To scared to beat on her chest in fear It'd cave in
Death waved again and each time leaves her
In a coma, for a week, to wake up to more seizures
But this time ain't like the rest
I can see right through her chest
And see her heart ain't got no fuckin beats left
Then a voluptuous ghost crawls from a host
Looking like she did in High School then fades when I get close
