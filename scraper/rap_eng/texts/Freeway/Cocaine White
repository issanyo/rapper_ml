Pulled up to the dealer, to get my wheels right
Homie asked me what colour I like
I wanted Cocaine White (That's Right)
I wanted Cocaine White
He said 'Half a milli, that's about right'
Pulled out 5 cash, told him 'shine it up nice' (That's Right)
No, that's Cocaine White (That's Right)
Cocaine White

Freeway

Uh, Yea, The games on and I've been here scoring
I've been world touring, I've been Clear Portin'
Get to the cash fast, like I'm Flash Gordon
Sick bling, six rings like I'm Air Jordan
Before all the Panel's, Beamer's and Porsche's
We was pushing pristine, we was less fortunate
The way I rose from the bottom, the people oughta pay me
Fried rice type, sugar water baby
From the hood, all my G's got felonies
They couldn't make it to the Army or the Navy
Real spit, I used to live my low paid life
That's why I need my whip Cocaine White

Fat Joe
This is business, never personal
Either they put you in park, or they reversing you
That Cocaine White
Been told you that them folks ain't right
Keep talking to the Feds, they ain't post that riiiggght?
I'm Eazy'E with the flame thrower
Disowned by my Mom's, a Cocaine grower
I'm on the box of Arm & Hammer though
Still the youngest in charge, I let the hammer go
I keep bitches for the long runs
And I fuck em in two's and make all cum
Grills mania, got em in Pennsylvania
For the low, ???

North side, stand up

Yea, We was young bucks, trying to get our bucks right
We was grinding, we was yawning, we was up nights
Uh, Graduated from the thug life
Need that foreign, same colour as Trump's wife
Presidential the wrist, Homie, is necessary
He legendary, it's detrimental to bet against him
??? so he got the weapon forever, it's with him
White whip, White House, I just need a Lewinsky
Always great, when I link with my people from Cali
Y'all niggas got talent, but we are the gifted
Free flow champagne every time that I spit it
Penthouse ??? lift, you know it's a ticket

Not a wrinkle on my shirt
Not a speck on my shoes
Do what I do
Long as it's Cocaine White (That's right)
