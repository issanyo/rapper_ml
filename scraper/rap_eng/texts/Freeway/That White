Verse 1: (Miz MAF)
White wit the scales coke in my nails
Got a cheese residue thats cocaine fingerprints
I copped on a point an I ain't really seen it ever since
Im like the hood Merrill Lynch my haze got a funny stench
If being broke is a joke then nope I ain't been funny since
That cocaine cracked stacked up my money pot money block
An I seen this shit since kindergarten
I used to stack crates at the tables an chop up plenty rocks
Now the only thing that change is the chairs
An a couple choppas a couple blockas an they ain't there
You slinging crack in the hood my nigga an that ain't rare
Have you ever need to grab from poppi an he ain't there what
See we fiend for the white just like a error
Mistake white out fiends come copping her up
Powder nose mascara powder pots get flared up
Like rick fiends think they the shit they take hit like Whoa

We gone get it said we gone it
Got a team hustlers yup the re-up gang reinvented
An if you got then you motherfucking better spend it

Til the heat turn soft to hard like a biscuit biscuit

You froze from the blast Miz MAF knows the game
Knows the game doesnt last
Thats why I live fast fucking up the cash
Then its right back to the block like we on get rich ave
Quick flip crack a brick then give me my half of the half of the half
Thats four and half in the bag wit no tab straight drop straight cop
Got em chumming strip is moving think not cakes not
Bands is the icing I'm reaching in the pan an pulling out a Breitling
From them pulling on the lightening the MAF

Leave your son a bastard make sure the pastor get a invite
Counting money is how I end nights with a bad bitch from my inbox
