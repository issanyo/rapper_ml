[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Uhh, for lovin' me girl
Just wanna thank you
(We gon' take it there one time, yeah)
Look at what you can do, man
(Uhh, OH! OH! Yeah)
Free, I like this shit right here man (Santana, c'mon)
Girl, c'mon
Yeah, let's do it like this

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Santana's so focused on you
Come holla at a boy that's focused on you
Uh huh, uh huh
Shorty I ain't tryin' to give you the run around
I'm just tryin' to come get you a run around
Skip through a couple towns
Maybe skip through a couple rounds
If your man act dumb I'ma shut him down
I'm sort of a long distance brother
Long trips, long chips, long dick and rubbers
Come roll with a pimp or gangsta
Hustler by nature
Trust that I'll take ya (and you know what)
I'll show you the rules and perimeters
Show you how to move with the Uz' how to handle it
Show you how to cut loose soon as we scramble it
On the block as soon as the moon hit be scramblin'
And you can be my down ass
Yeah baby, that's for sure
I'ma show you how package raw
How to strap it on
How to take trips with the package on
How to go and come back with the package gone
Just stacks of cash we on, c'mon mama, oh!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana (Freeway)]
And y'all niggas better cuff ya girls
Cause Santana and Free is runnin' up the girls (yeah)
No game, just fuck your girls
Uhh, pollute her mind and corrupt the world (yeah)
(Give her pounds, give her pies, give her cake (yeah)
Hit a city, hit a town, hit a state (yeah)
Every ghetto every hood we there
Heavy metal in the Rocawear, yeah)

[Verse 2: Freeway]
I been to every ghetto all around the world
I'll bring that Roc shit around ya girl and take down, nigga
I take pounds nigga, matter fact I take pounds to chicks
Give 'em train tickets across the border
(Is you going or what?)
Can you go bring back my packages that you joined to her
Get in positions with my squad
That's like ironic, you with me then the venential driver
I'll have you drive me to E-way and stuff, stuff in out tronics, geah
I need a woman to bake
Cook pies in the winter then diet, give her the weight
Shed pounds in the summer, I like Rocawear Miss Wear
Thick hair, chick there, fat ass, sick pair
When we travel to Orlando when we get there, shit yeah
Bilingual always slang, across the border diamond yang
Put in orders, even though we just came to hang
Then we take it where we left there, heck yeah
I need more then a woman cause it's more then you think here
Bank here, who rank down here? And I'm more than a rapper
Cause it's more than these rhymes here, poss' here
Hold Nas down here, holla

[Chorus: Juelz Santana (Freeway)]
And y'all niggas better cuff ya girls
Cause Santana and Free is runnin' up the girls (yeah)
No game, just fuck your girls
Uhh, pollute her mind and corrupt the world (yeah)
(Give her pounds, give her pies, give her cake (yeah)
Hit a city, hit a town, hit a state (yeah)
Every ghetto every hood we there
Heavy metal in the Rocawear, yeah)
