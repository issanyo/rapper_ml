[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
I’m into cruisin' with bitches that’s into bruisin'
And they interested in tattoos and they smellin'
Like there’s a brewery that’s slipped into they perfume and I love it I’m into trouble, it ain’t around, I’mma seek it out
I’m like a cutter, I feel alive when I’m bleedin' out
I’m sittin' down to do business, I got chancletas on
Naked broads dance at the meetings, I’m finna smang ‘em all
I leave my kids in the tissue they wipe they make-up on
And if your mama raised a good girl
Your mama raised you wrong, my faith is gone
Now all I believe in is money, money and money and money
Should I repeat it? Money, if what you see's what you get
Then it ain’t a secret, you ain’t never gon’ be shit
Why? You never seen shit
I ain’t facetious, I mean that I’m needin' lump sums
‘Cause I’mma give my kids the trust issues that come trust funds
These bitches see, goin' down on me like a come-up
Wantin' all them problems money can buy except the drug ones
I’m done runnin', that don’t mean I’m done runnin' shit
I could take a break for a half and let you catch up a bit
Just wait, just wait a second man, any cash, I’mma double it
Until my album budget’s like petty cash in the government
I'll be album workin' like Halliburton was frontin' it
And you can tell I’m eatin', I’m out stuntin' with chubby chicks
I don’t wanna answer your calls, send me a fuckin' text
‘Cause I be cuttin' you off if you ain’t cuttin' checks

[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
We doin' high level shit, money in the clip
Runnin' down that paper while you cuffin' on your bitch
And we don't give a damn where you from or who you with
Hell no, we on that high level shit
We doin' high level shit, money in the clip
Runnin' down that paper while you cuffin' on your bitch
And we don't  give a damn where you from or who you with
Hell no, we on that high level shit

[Verse Two: Freeway]
This is high level with sky level with my bezel, courtesy of rollie big face
Shit takes MC’s light years to get on my level
Bring Superman down to earth, get they shit quaked
We make hit songs, y’all hit brakes, hit the pause button
Better wonder, shots random, squeeze the cannon
Hear the thunder fastbreak, y’all niggas skate like the law comin'
Different Strokes, Phillip Drummond, different dough, hood shit
Richard Poe, jump out the Lambo when the Lambo keep runnin'
And your bitch never frontin', she always told me it’s a go
Maybe it’s the dough or maybe it’s the flow
If so, may me make them hoes go crazy, tell ‘em sah pah saviv
‘Cause your boy so Haiti, all that means that I’m survivin'
All that means I’m still mobbin' after a natural disaster
I’m still ready for action, shout out to Bronson if you see As-Salamu
When you see me, salute me, not a kink in my armor
It’s weird how my mama think I’mma a rap star
But I’mma part time pipe bomber, teem early
So I’m restin' in the night hours, get broke, move coke, white power
