[Hook]
I've been waiting all my life
The sound got me levitating off the ground
Feelin' like a poltergeist
Soon to be a Mogul, right?
Shit don't happen overnight
Hot as ice, don't touch them boy I'm hot as ice
Don't touch them, can't touch them boy I am hot as ice
Hot as ice
Don't touch them cuz I'm hot as ice
Don't touch them, can't touch them girl I am hot as ice

[Verse 1]
I've been in another states
I'm getting money cuz your nigga relay
Told you niggas how to run a race
I'm legendary, ain't enough for debate
At your door with a hundred shakes
Niggas I hustle [?]
I'm a teen [?]
[?]

[Hook]
I've been waiting all my life
The sound got me levitating off the ground

Hot as ice, don't touch them boy I'm hot as ice
Don't touch them, can't touch them boy I am hot as ice
Hot as ice

And I've been on a road lately
