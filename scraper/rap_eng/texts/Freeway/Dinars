[Intro]
Hey Fray, they say three is a charm
I say we're three time classy!
What you think they gonna call us next?
Team early!

[Pre-Hook] x2
What's the
Say might do us on the
Often get to bottom with the jelly
Blow, try to live it, tell it to tell it
And I can still get the shit, go to Sally

[Hook]
Reals, dinars, how we get them?
Bars, how we living?
Like stars, flow out of space like Mars
And we run for the dollar bill
We r-r-run for the dollar bill
And we run for the dollar bill
We r-r-run for the dollar bill

[Verse 1]
Life from the mogo, ice on the row
Big business, no Volvo, Instagram photos!
Show your people how I'm living, this is promo
We bounce around the world like Pogo
Move my cheek from North Philly to Soho
And she brought your hoe, and they brought more hoes
I believe in team work, cause the team work
But my first Heineken got that dolo
And I got some ways to stand up, put my team first
And a team never picked that so slow
You can hear me, everybody hear me
Ain't nobody leaking, ain't nobody viving
Cross us, ain't nobody living
Fuck you, we gonna pop, ain't nobody
Nobody wanna work with a ticket get the money, that's funny!
Sing that, hoe, everybody need it!

[Hook]
Reals, dinars, how we get them?
Bars, how we living?
Like stars, flow out of space like Mars
And we run for the dollar bill
We r-r-run for the dollar bill
And we run for the dollar bill
We r-r-run for the dollar bill

[Verse 2]
I make a lot of air errands
Even if I ain't got money, I got days, so I am rich!
I've been on the road to Iraqi errands
My music stay true to it, let them switch
Got bread, got beef, that's a sandwich
Add more beef, that's a manwich
If it ain't fake beef, it's for sure beef
I react like Jason
I employ young dudes that destroy beef
Islamic farm style, shut your brand down
Young cash, call dash with the cash
Stacks in the rubber bankrounds in my
Girl, don't play! She was on her way
I sent her away, she came back with a gay girl
I don't understand how these niggas play around
How the fuck they lay around?

[Hook]
Reals, dinars, how we get them?
Bars, how we living?
Like stars, flow out of space like Mars
And we run for the dollar bill
We r-r-run for the dollar bill
And we run for the dollar bill
We r-r-run for the dollar bill

[Verse 3]
We ride it, you got it, admire the effort
You test us, we will teach you lessons, we're choppers
The flow is a
The lean is from Texas
The weed is from Cally, my bitch from Bahamas
Got strips in Atlanta
In Winston
You cross us, you're missing
We send for your momma
You send for your runner, you've been
We're snithcing
But we've been busy ripping
We get in!

[Hook]
Reals, dinars, how we get them?
Bars, how we living?
Like stars, flow out of space like Mars
And we run for the dollar bill
We r-r-run for the dollar bill
And we run for the dollar bill
We r-r-run for the dollar bill
