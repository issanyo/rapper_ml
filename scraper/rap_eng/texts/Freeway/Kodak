[Verse 1]
Tell them I'm back, nigga, this shit is back on!
Them suckers killed my nigga, Jack, I brought the strap for 'em
I love my squad like Barry Bonds, I go to bat for 'em
Run up on you, pull your cap for 'em, yeah I'm that bul
It's State Prop, nigga, O & Mac home!
My brother Sigel healed up, this shit is back on
If my homey go away, pick up the slack for 'em
Hold 'em down, buss a trap for 'em, yeah I'm that bul
We riders only death can divide us
Pull a homi', catch a body and won't say shit about it
We will air shit about it so if you hear shit about it
Just keep it to yourself and you won't have no problems
We appreciate the fame because we came from the bottom
If you short with my change I'll put the thing to your mama
Got that white in the house and I named it Obama
You can save all the comments, we just came for the commas

[Hook]
If you want it, I got it
Hit that stage and I rock it
Cop that car and I drive it
I be on autopilot
I got Benjis in pocket
I got women in pocket
If she get outta line
Put her back in the pocket
I done been around the world
And I'm back, would you look at that?
And I'm quick to tell a hater
What ya lookin' at? I got a reason to ball
If it wasn't for them pictures wouldn't see me at all
And I say

[Verse 2]
Take a picture cause it last longer
Would you, we still around because we last long, little nigga!
Got the rhythm like the Blues Brothers
Call this Kodak, I see ya true colors, fucker
We about to bomb on y'all niggas like Hiroshima
I need to see them out of here like a bad cavity
Call me the dentist, me and your chick be playin' tennis
Cause I throw it at her and she throw it back at me
What's happenin', haters wanna Gat me
100 worth of jewelry on the kid, they wanna nap me!
Never let 'em get to me so I'm ridin' with my hammer
Check Laighton in Atlanta, on my way to Tallahasee
I'm fancy, I'm hood, but I stash a lot
I'm art in the flesh, I'm Basquiat
Realest rapper, I don't care if he's nice or not
Spread white, get rid of the pain like Icy Hot

[Hook]
If you want it, I got it
Hit that stage and I rock it
Cop that car and I drive it
I be on autopilot
I got Benjis in pocket
I got women in pocket
If she get outta line
Put her back in the pocket
I done been around the world
And I'm back, would you look at that?
And I'm quick to tell a hater
What ya lookin' at? I got a reason to ball
If it wasn't for them pictures wouldn't see me at all
And I say

[Instrumental Bridge]
