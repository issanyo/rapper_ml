[Verse 1]
Living legend up in leather trunks mayweather
Turn freeway to the tippy top and let it bump
If you in your jeep turn the shit loud let it dump
My music similar to fishscale flood the streets
Remember me best bearded Mc
Ya'll niggas German Shepard's am a different pedigree
My music cause addictions meth amphetamines
Well aware ah these snakes tryna get ahead of me
Better be bout they alphabets
Hope they on they P's and they Q's
Cause i'll move them like a quarter P
We are fully prepared for the slaughter B
My team handle disorder disorderly...yeaaah

[Freeway]
Nah mean  fuck ya'll talking bout got 15 men
In this shit choke one ah you lil niggas man
Have some fucking respect

[Verse 2]
Bitch I've been getting my chips up
Since flip phones
Before rap i made the nicks jump
Kris Cross Mr. Miyagi i wax on wax off
Was a worker now a boss
An i dont worry bout the cost
She just another black girl lost
Cause she let them hit with the hat on hat off
Use to serve the hard all day
Cause we cook soft
If you try to rob us ya'll niggas better get lost
Ya'll outlandish ya'll headed for a pitfall
All shots land and you'll be dead before the kickoff
Mile high club gimme
Head for i take off
Head in the air and
Head for i land
Give head when i come through and
Head for i dig off
Head in the studio and
Head in the van
These rappers keep changing like zartan
The real is back everyday rep PA
Armour steel his fan
Got a AK buried down in Baltimore
I'm ah dig it up on the day the cops kill again
Till then we'll be stranded like Gilligan
Freeway back with the music you can feel again
All these new rappers looking like they bout to squeal again
Ya'll muthafucka's hella bent thas not militant
Why try him when you know he'll kill
An he'll do it on his own free will

[Freeway]
Respect your fucking elders been doing this shit Legend
Why Try him an you know he'll kill an he'll do it on his own free will yeaaaah..
