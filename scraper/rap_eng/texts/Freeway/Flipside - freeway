Who, now clap for me mami, oh
Just clap for me mami, just blaze
Okay, and Free, okay, yeah [unverified]
Que tu quieres mujeres, said she blow la-la
Flipside, and she my baby mama
Get wild, okay
Freeway got the hood on smash
Pop in tape, step on gas and get ghost nigga
Freeway got the club on lock, step on stage
Set it down leave with a broad, check for her age
Post up, fans suffer circle the block
Call the cops, it's the Roc' in your area
Post up, distribute to the block
Freeway move the rocks in your area
Yeah, Pop tried to shut me down
Cops tried to shut me down, haters wanna hit me up
What? My Glock carry heavy rounds
Mack carry heavy rounds packed in the Chevy truck
What? You better ring the alarm
Before I cock back, dump on you and your boys
And have black suits, tucked on you and your mom
But back to the song, said she wanna suck on me and the boys
Her ass look good in a thong
And she want me to sneak in the building like Trojans in "Troy"
Best believe there's Trojans involved
Hats lift over the boy, oh boy
We rip crowds, whole lot of fire and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
Get wild, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate
Flipside, crack house and a little bit of bass
(Flipside)
Is all it takes to make the block
Get wild, park keys and a little bit of cheese
(Get wild)
Is all it takes to make her leave
With these, O.G.'s
(With these, O.G.'s)
Tell that hoe until she roll on a pole, I'm tryna squeeze
With ease then breathe
(With ease, then breathe)
I ain't Hov', I just know what I know
I'm talkin' owe Sparks five, ride for a dollar bill
Famous up in Hollywood, high in them Holly-hills
I, can't deny how the mamis feel
Higher than the cable bill, slide with your baby girl
P. Crakk and I ain't for play
I got a mack that'll change your day
Fall back, get your act intact
P I M P U P H O E S is all the rest
And yes, this is Philly, you welcome to come check us
Crakk, wherever I holla at be gettin' neck in
Pass her the thing, tell her make it go ring
The prince of S.P., is soon to be the king and
We rip crowds, whole lot of fire and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
Get wild, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate
Flipside, crack house and a little bit of bass
(Flipside)
Is all it takes to make the block
Get wild, park keys and a little bit of cheese
(Get wild)
Is all it takes to make her leave
Now how many hoes in your motherfuckin' group?
Wanna take a ride in my '89 Delk
She felt the kid, thumbtack, held the roof
Up on her cell phone, "Freeway got me in the squadder
He a rider, from the block to the booth"
I'm as, real as they come, the gorillas'll come
Six could chill 'til they come, gotta peel when they done
But let her spend the night, all night
'Cause the heat call me a liar
She just like Honey so I called her Mariah
Wanna see, if she got what it takes to carry across state
And travel across state, with things taped to her waist
Mami wanna ride with pa
Bad bitches get scooped like Haagan Daas
And put on the team shoot, put on the Bean bitch
Lean bitch, shoot at they entourage
Hit up the team camp, pull on your jeans bitch
We rip crowds, whole lot of fire and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
Get wild, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate
Flipside, crack house and a little bit of bass
(Flipside)
Is all it takes to make the block
Get wild, park keys and a little bit of cheese
(Get wild)
Is all it takes to make her leave
