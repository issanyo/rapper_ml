[Freeway:]
Yo holla at ya motherfuckin' boy
Freewizzle in this bitch
Banks you with me?

[Lloyd Banks:]
Yeah
I'm back...
Again

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Now they call me Boywonder but i'm better known as Banks
Got a nine millimeter I'll put nine in your tank
You think that i'm a slip
Nigga hop up off my dick
And the things'll B-A-N-G-
So please don't envy
Niggas get paranoid whenever I come to town
The one your girls fuckin' whenever you're not around
You clown
They feel my sound
And they hear me when I spit
How my jewelry got baguettes and canaries in every chip
Fuck pol you can't scare me on a trip
My jet skis ridin' in Miami with a chick
Thats thick
A hollow tip
Could turn ya man into a bitch
Have him hidin' in the closet by the spannards and the fish
And I know i'm gettin' money but I plan on gettin' rich
See I come from the gutter where theres cameras in the bricks
You should see my whip is sick when I'm ridin' through the hood
You're tired of being broke and mad that i'm doin' good
The police daydreaming of havin' me on that hood
Harrassin' me for I.D. and naggin' me cause they could
But i'm still blowin' wood
And grabbin' it out the jar
I'm a G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R-

[Verse 2: Freeway]
My niggas move basil but for now they switched the way
Bring a brick around ya way
I got workers with the grill
I'm workin' with the steel
Say H-I- with the -K
And I'm G-A-M-E-
So please don't come around my way with the dumb shit
Bad place to visit you get ya son hit
Four fifth cock it and spit at you
Get ya car bombed, robbed jewels popped with a quickness
And we G-A-M-E-
We show no sympathy
Cops know how we ride they got it in for Free
He move keys through the land where they fathers die
He got a mill to see
F-R-E-E-
Hey guys i'm from 106 And Park
Before I pull you while you parked
Hit you with 106
One got a extra clip
Back against the shelves
And we G-A-M-E-
You came in here and hear
Uzi in here
Check
Nuzi in this bitch
Uzi got the Uzi Brother Nuzi got the fifth in here
Do you like the movie
Bring the toolys to the port and let G-O-O- guns
