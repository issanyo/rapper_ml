[Intro: Freeway & ?]
Frank
Yes Sir
I'm tired of fallin' back
So what you want to do?
It's time to put the pressure on theses niggas
Yeah, I think it's that time
Let's get 'em

[Verse 1: Freeway]
Flame thrower, we be scorin', we be reppin'
Till the game over
I'm a bitter rap legend in a Range Rover
Put the 6 and the 7 up my blessings
Mess with us, precious, so check his vitals
North Philly icon, built for survival
I'm a don, it be wine everywhere that I go
You're damned for the gold but the thobes is from Cairo
When God made me he broke the mold nigga
I ain't with the nonsense, nothing with the doctors
Thought he was a boxer so I smoked him like a rasta
I could tell he was a nuisance, always like to do shit
Thought he was a shooter so I tagged him with the Ruger
I know Hov, I got the blueprint
Black Panther party how we move like Huey Newton
Eat my beef without the gluten
Can't compete with all you losers, watchin' from the bleachers
It's confusing how we eatin' but it make you throw up

[Chorus: Freeway]
I see you hatin, all that love better
The boy gettin' mad, check his blood pressure
You see a nigga shinin', check his blood pressure
All that anger that's gon' give you high blood pressure [blood pressure]
What you talkin', check his blood pressure
You see a nigga stuntin', check his blood pressure
You see a nigga winnin', check his blood pressure
Ya boy sorry, better check that nigga blood pressure

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Hollygrove, that’s 17, no L-I-E, I’m L-I-T
I’m the Y-M-E, K-I-N-G, B-L-O-O-D-I-N-G
I’m O-U-T-H-E-R-E with my G-O-O-N-Z-Z-Z
We T-O-O-D-E-E-P
I gave a bitch 3 wishes, she wanted me, me, me
Bloods like pressure, that's you on a stretcher
These bitches too extra, charge you extra for the pleasure
I got killers in my section, protection on protection
We catch you, interception, and finesse you in a second
I got tattoos on my texture, bad news when I catch ya
We kidnap your girl we need that Ke$ha, we molest her
I’m a nigga with aggression, attitude erection
Pressure bust pipes but not this fuckin’ blood vessel
Let my niggas come test you, suggest you call rescue
Go to war with one pistol like a fuckin’ scud missile
All you see is blood tissue, guts, liver, God bless you
Tunechi, I’m special, so special, no pressure, motherfucker

[Chorus: Freeway & Lil Wayne]
I see you hatin', all that love better (see you hatin')
That boy gettin' mad, check his blood pressure (check his blood pressure)
You see a nigga shining, check his blood pressure
All that anger that's gonna give you high blood pressure
Blood pressure, what you talkin' 'bout, blood pressure (check his blood pressure)
You see it, it's nothin', gotta check his blood pressure (check his blood pressure)
You see that nigga with it, check his blood pressure (check his blood pressure)
[?], blood pressure

[Verse 3: Freeway & Lil Wayne]


[Chorus: Freeway & Lil Wayne]
I see you hatin' [?] (I see you hatin')
That boy gettin' mad, check his blood pressure (check his blood pressure)
You see a nigga gotta check his blood pressure (check his blood pressure)
All that anger that's gonna lead to high blood pressure (high blood pressure)
Blood pressure, what you talkin' 'bout, blood pressure (blood pressure)
You see it, it's nothin', gotta check his blood pressure (blood pressure)
You see that nigga with it, check his blood pressure (check his blood pressure)
[?], blood pressure

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Ouhh, fuck with me Free
