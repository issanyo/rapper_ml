[Verse 1: R.O.D.]

I don't know where we went wrong
I do not remember
But I don't wanna waste no time explaining shit to you
I think I'm done
But now I realize that you're not the one
No...
I don't feel like coming home
I be missing dinner
I sit up in my car for thirty minutes before I do
Girl I'm done
My mind is all made up that you're not the one
No... no, no, no..
I can't sleep, I toss and turn when I lay right next to you
Cause' I can't deal with the disrespectful things you like to do
See everyday we arguin'
And I don't have the tolerance
And I don't have the patience to do this no more

[Chorus: R.O.D.]

I can't stand you... (BIATCH)
Girl you make it hard to stay
You make it hard to stay
I can't stand you... (BIATCH)
Girl I got to walk away
I got to walk away

[Verse 2: R.O.D.]

Baby
What's wrong with you
I'm tired of what we're going through
Nag about everything I do
But you don't understand that I do this for you
So you can do all the things that you want to do
(So you can do the things that you want to do)
Everyday I try to make this perfect
But I realize this shit ain't worth it nah. (nah)
I walk around like everything is fine
But I know that it's a waste of time
Dealing with you...
Baby we're through
Oh!

[Chorus: R.O.D]

I can't stand you... (BIATCH)
Girl you make it hard to stay
You make it hard to stay
I can't stand you... (BIATCH)
Girl I got to walk away
I got to walk away

[Verse 3: Freeway]

I got to walk away
You ain't got my back
So I guess I got to back away
This ain't the tennis court I'm sick of going back and fourth
And you always say you hated when I talk this way
And you know I hate it when you act that way
When I met you, you just wasn't in your [?] that way
I took you out the hood five seconds before they shoot up
Your block and you could've got clapped that day
But seems all you in for was the finer things
[???] Designer rings
[Trips destination blue waters ???]
[Downtown wrist caught?]
And the headquarters
The maids make the bed for us
Dead wrong but you still drop dead gorgeous
Now you're dead weight rigor mortus
[I want you when I take you out ???????]

[Chorus: R.O.D.]

I can't stand you... (BIATCH)
Girl you make it hard to stay
You make it hard to stay
I can't stand you... (BIATCH)
Girl I got to walk away
I got to walk away
