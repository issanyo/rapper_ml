[Intro]
Okay
Statik Selektah
Freeway
Liberty City, baby

[Verse 1]
I'm starvin', think I got about six bucks left
I'm lookin' for a victim that I can grip up quick
Yeah, I'm tryin' to find me a jerk, comin' from work
A skank, comin' from the bank so I can get her check
Somebody wonderin' whether they're up next
If anybody resist, I'll slit their neck
It's hood intellect, grip 'em up, take things
Show 'em you don't give a fuck, shoot 'em up, bang bang
I hang with a gang tang, drinkin' forty-ounce malt liquor
Try to play me, dump the blicker, make his brains hang
Today, it's the same thing, run up on a homie with the SIG
If he like Jibbs, tryin' to let his chain hang
I'm takin' that, I'm pawnin' that
I got to him first, yeah, I know you hatin' that
When I double back, you know it gets worse
Car wild and purse, I'm eatin' all of that

[Hook]
This is a car jack, you 'bout to get your car snatched
Don't get your life took along with that, fall back
This is a strong arm, make sure you remain calm
Me and your auntie 'bout to take off, and we'll be long gone

This is a car jack, you 'bout to get your car snatched
Don't get your life took along with that, fall back
This is a strong arm, make sure you remain calm
Me and your aunties are takin' off, and we'll be long gone

[Verse 2]
When I shoot, you better duck
Don't give a fuck about the long arm, of the law
We can brawl, we can draw guns
You gettin' money, dummy? Yeah, I need a Porsche on
Not tryin' to give it up, well, fuck it, I extort funds
This is how it goes, east to the west coast
Don't matter where I'm at, don't he got import guns?
I got gorilla heaters, nine millimeters
With all medical procedures, I abort sons
Over M-O, N-E, Y, listen
I let them bullets from the semi, fly quicker
I'm screamin' out loud, why whisper?
Come at me, I'm comin' to your house, why diss ya?
Gun on me is barkin' out loud like a pit bull
If I run out of bullets, then I stick ya
With the knife, yeah, I'm trife in the '09
I'm lawless, makin' people lose they life in the '09

[Hook]
This is a car jack, you 'bout to get your car snatched
Don't get your life took along with that, fall back
This is a strong arm, make sure you remain calm
Me and your auntie 'bout to take off, and we'll be long gone

This is a car jack, you 'bout to get your car snatched
Don't get your life took along with that, fall back
This is a strong arm, make sure you remain calm
Me and your aunties are takin' off, and we'll be long gone
