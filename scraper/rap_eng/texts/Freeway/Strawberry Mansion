[Verse 1: Lushlife]
All I need is
Henny, dimes
And bottle blondes
Fine the bottom-line
Catch me in the
Flat black Ac
Ricardo Montalban
Columbine Louis Vuitton
Just a dollar sign
Petty crime
Get you a three to nine
That’s by design
I don’t mind
I’ll wait for ascension
I don’t want to
Fuck around
And wait for a pension
Got some ends
Not to mention
When Oppenheimer was crying
Quoting the Gita, black
Hiroshima was dying
Fuck it, I don’t want either
Stack
Cheddar
Puf stress
And die
It’s Lushlife
Over everything
The session wide
And there’s no question why
I get you open
Praying for false dreams
401Ks a pyramid scheme
IRAs will cost dreams
I’m on the humble
Whipping Thrill Kill Kult
Or Steel Pulse
Trying not to think
How real shit was
Believe that

[Chorus (Scratch)]
Lushlife bedouin rock
My raps are steady slamming
Guaranteed to blow
LL
Be that Philly Bol
North Philly, South Philly
23rd Tasker
Lushlife bedouin rock
My raps are steady slamming
Puffing on the trees ‘til I go
LL
Be that Philly Bol
North Philly, South Philly
23rd Tasker


[Verse 2: Freeway]
West Philly
Shimmer Hill
Uptown be spazzing
Right outside of Philly
You know in Chester
They blasting
Young boys smashing
Keep the ruger double-action
Always put it on
Like it’s a part of their fashion
Gonna take ours
‘Cause you know we sick of asking
Or Barack or either
That or
Betty Crocker fake pies
Starving eight summers
See the hunger in my eyes
If we don’t get the dough
You get the seats
I get to blasting
Your dad get the handkerchief
Your mom could get the napkin
Your boys could be the pall bearer
They could get the casket
Can’t afford to bury ‘em
You could get the ashes
I’ll be right back
I’m a get the matches
Man, I’m in Strawberry Mansion
In a BM with a bad bitch
Listen to them rap niggas
They be spitting bad bitch
Used to move bricks
On the Turnpike
Rough life
Y’all punks squirrely
It’s Team Early and Lushlife
