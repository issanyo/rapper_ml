Cracks in the kitchen, multiplication
Rocks that I slash with precision

?Joey froggy bucky? man about these bucks
Dudes wanna get there burners and buck me (Sparks, Oschino!)
Send they young bucks to trunk me
Separate me from the family
Bottle me up, that's why keep the Nina
Hollow it up (Whew!)

Just hollows heat seakin (C'mon!)
You really wanna piece of the Roc?

[Young Chris]
Ayo, Chris wanna see blood (Young)
It's on sight like a Crip when he see Blood

[Peedi Crakk]
Young Chris be easy, it's ya boy Peedi
Roll wit me or ride against me
Make it look easy how I empty out in ya Bentley
I'm a close range shooter, blow flames out the Ruger
Losins for Losers, I got my zoo back from the devil and I could
Cut ya face and throw the knife in the swewy
The block captain, clappin a gatlin at Sam Bouey
Kiss Madre
