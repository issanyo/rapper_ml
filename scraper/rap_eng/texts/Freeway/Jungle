[Verse 1]
Propane spitter, cocaine spitter
Cocaine flipper, get caught
No name, no blame, I will never ?? niggas
Pay what I owe and never short-change niggas
Delta 88 ?or the sports Range?, Scarface
Stick to the script, I never snort 'caine, should've been
On that Meek Mill song 'I'm a Boss'
Even if I take a loss, have the lawyers at the court date
We're all real, y'all part-real part-fake
Nigga, fall back, I'm on ?stimpack part 8?
You're at the park, I post at the park gates
Fly overseas, come home, tear apart states
Your chick hear my music, hear her heart rate
Race like the Porsche Panamera to my parking space
Y'all hate, we're glorious, victorious
We supply flavor like Lawry so you all can taste

[Hook]
Let me show you how we do it in the jungle
Make work tumble, move it by the bundle
My hood push birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Make work flip-flop, move it by the nick drop

Don't know how you do this, how we do it in the jungle
Make work tumble, move it by the bundle
My hood push birds like Alfred Hitchcock
Make work flip-flop, move it by the nick drop

[Verse 2]
Got locked, did my tick-tock, did not
Go back, no rat for federal, forget it, won't
Say a single letter out the alphabet, I'm credible
Cause my flow is so incredible I got it Ziploc'ed
Y'all be wearing skinnies, I am never wearing skinnies
But my tires are skinny, got the Benny on flip-flops
Henny on ice, got a couple killers with me
Pretty Boy Face with me, and you know they on his top
Beard on, ?? gear on, four-dos on
Therefore, all the hoes gonna flizzock
Shows on lizzock, hope you get the message
In my hood they call me Tetris, put a block on the blizzock
Hopscotch, ?king? ball, my hood ring off
Shots that will put your Popeye in a bizzox
Rob for the money, we don't rob for the joy
Bitter leprechaun boy, got me eyes on the pizzot

[Hook]
