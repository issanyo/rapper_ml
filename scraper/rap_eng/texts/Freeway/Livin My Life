[Intro: Gillie Da Kid]

Yeah, PC Beats
This right here is a motion picture
(Get to the movie early)
This is only for high definition (Ace McCloud)
Everybody report to the dance floor right now (that’s right)
Hey Freeway I see ya boy (I’m here GD)
Let’s get get get it

[Hook: Gillie da Kid] x2

One, two, three four five
All my people keep your hands up high (hands up)
Ain’t no question on how we ride (we ride)
You wonder why them boys so fly (fly)
Is it my whip, is it my ice, is it my kicks, is it my wife, is it my cribs
I don’t really know homie but this is my life
Just living my life

[Verse 1: Gillie Da Kid]

Welcome to Philly, around here everybody’s Gillie Gillie Gillie
Crazy, maybe they should label me as Philly’s Baby
No records sold but they love me like I’m Jay-Z (Hov)
Put your hands up high
I buy whips you niggas just test drive
Every time I pass they be flashing their eyes
‘Cause they know I keep a dime in my passenger’s side
Face so pretty, lip gloss popping
Take a second before you notice her tits and her thighs
Gillie like the energizer bunny, keep going keep going
Aw man I don’t (?) them ayyy
I know nothing, I know I know this, that I’m leaving with her little mami so thick
Hard to focus with all this patron
You in those tight jeans the those Giuseppe's on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freeway]

When I pull up to the club with, them gangsters with me
Don’t be hating make me put those gangsters on you
Ain’t no telling what those boys gon’ do
Chicks drip from the rip when me and Gil come through
Thank you for the fellatio she showed skill
Know this, I keep the Smith on me like Will
I’m everywhere and everywhere they play my stuff
(?) me international like Gamble and Huff
Main capital, last album banging fifth back me up
Me and Gil on the track is that not enough
All that hating y’all should wrap it up
Before we start contemplating on clapping yall up
White whip Benny looking like milk
I’m punching through the city freeballing like Wilt
Chamberlin, I will slay your men
We don’t just anger men we aim to kill

[Hook]

[Freeway]

World’s Best we clap for them advances
We go back to back in front of dancers
Took chances and weathered the shower
Now I’m MVP of the city like Ryan Howard

[Gillie Da Kid]

No love for cowards I’m living my life
Triple black Aston with the dual pipes
Benji’s palace, so much ice in my Phillies piece
White folks thought I was Jimmy Rollins

[Meek Mill]

I am Meek Mill and I am in my bag
Home of the Stylistics where we been had swag
Y’all jocking my Steelo
I was still giving piss to the P.O
When they traded T.O. to Dallas

[Gillie da Kid]

I’m riding down Broad Street and I’m the pilot
Something low mileage sitting on Privats
Everybody know Gillie stay Doug E. Fresh I don’t need no stylist
