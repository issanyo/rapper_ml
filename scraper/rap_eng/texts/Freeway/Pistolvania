[Verse 1: Jakk Frost]
I can show you how the nine spit
It’s Frost, Freeway, and Vinnie from Jedi Mind Tricks, I’m on my grind trick
Niggas flows is hot but Frost greater
Y’all niggas don’t exist like Luke without Vader
Got a young buck that remind me of Lando Calrissian
Smooth as Billy Dee when he sneak his pistols in
Like Colt 45 it works every time
Vinnie out there drinking on that (that’s right)
I know they out there thinking on that
Niggas think about creeping on Jakk
Probably mad cause his main bitch creeping with Jakk
Every third weekend with Jakk she sleeping with Jakk
How sleazy is that?
Y’all niggas talk drugs but you ain’t seen the brick yet
I’ve been touching money since the Kid n Play Kick Step
But a house party to me is a crib full of fiends
Ready to cop that ziplock ready rock

[Hook: Jakk Frost & Freeway]
Hip hop started out in the park
That’s right, we used to do it when the weed would sparked
When the drinks start flowing and the green starts glowing
If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep going
Hip hop started out in the park
That’s right, we used to do it when the weed would sparked
When the drinks start flowing and the green starts glowing
If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep going


[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Who the best motherfucker in the street that you never heard?
The 45 separate your head and it severs nerves
Call me Koko B. Ware, I carry several birds
I’ll demolish enemy scholars with every deadly word
These motherfuckers don’t know the pain that the stainless doing
I’mma let 'em take it back to the block and explain it to 'em
Cut a motherfucker head like Hussein would do him
Take his motherfucking bread now, it’s painless to him
And feed the pitbulls that man’s bones
Cause I’m here to fuck the game up like Pac-man Jones
I’m Kobe with rock, if not I’ll fucking zone in the spot
But if you disrespect my mother or my home then you shot
I’m lonely a lot and that’s the type of person who’s deadly
And the 50 cal make your face look like spaghetti
Look at this feti, look at all this beautiful shit
A south Philly scumbag wearing Gucci and shit
It’s over

[Hook: Jakk Frost & Freeway]
Hip hop started out in the park
That’s right, we used to do it when the weed would sparked
When the drinks start flowing and the green starts glowing
If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep going
Hip hop started out in the park
That’s right, we used to do it when the weed would sparked
When the drinks start flowing and the green starts glowing
If you from the hood I know you feel me, keep going

[Verse 3: Freeway]
This is Jakk Frost, it’s your boy Vinnie, Philly Freezer
We do it proper cause hip hoppers they really need us
I tote the semi. If you warned you won’t really see it
How about a tough guy scream when he’s shot
I ran terror from the same era as Biggie and Pac
This is Roc-a, we will pop you leave you paraplegic
You never there. I’m everywhere. I say I’m there then believe it
When you see me Louis Vuitton here in the drop yeah
Philly Freezer get paper all year
New Year’s I’m on the ball, I’ll be there when it drops
These snitch niggas saying I’m there when I’m not
Bet you when the bodies dropping they start calling the law
Rockafella heat spitters, Desert Eagle heat holders
Philly Freezer keep soldiers that’ll ride for the cause
The AK will heat niggas, it’ll flip your Jeep over
If these niggas try me probably catch a body tomorrow yeah
