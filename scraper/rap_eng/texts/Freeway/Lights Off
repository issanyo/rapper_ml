I was taught to keep it G, never took tales
Pistol in my hand, swear im going through hell
Real nigga shit, sick of taking the ill
If I dont make it home, somebody go get my bill
Lights off, lights off, where them niggas at
Lights off, lights off, I ain't feelin' that
Lights off (Real shit), Lights off (here to get it back)
Lights off (Fuck them niggas) Light off (Im Back) X 2

Whatever it takes for me to be
Looked in way Im left
Other ways you recommend
Knowing Im bout whatever
Knowing Im niggas taught me good
Niggas tried to play me
Nobody told me that I couldn't
Wishing nobody told me that I could
And I won't stop till I get them both naked
Look motivation give me through what Im facing
Nobody giving it nigga, Id rather take it
I go and get it when I need mine
I still got black 45 crack a smile

I was taught to keep it G, never took tales
Pistol in my hand, swear im going through hell
Real nigga shit, sick of taking the ill
If I dont make it home, somebody go get my bill
Lights off, lights off, where them niggas at
Lights off, lights off, I ain't feelin' that
Lights off (Real shit), Lights off (here to get it back)
Lights off (Fuck them niggas) Light off (Im Back) X 2


Life is a bitch, I told her I dont need her
Somewhere in the hood, in a 2 seater
Printed out the hood I have never seen visas
Coming disrespect me
Mj stay hustle
Jumping on niggas never jumping off wax
Emotions paralyze, tell them I can't feel it
Tell them Im here to steal it

I was taught to keep it G, never took tales
Pistol in my hand, swear im going through hell
Real nigga shit, sick of taking the ill
If I dont make it home, somebody go get my bill
Lights off, lights off, where them niggas at
Lights off, lights off, I ain't feelin' that
Lights off (Real shit), Lights off (here to get it back)
Lights off (Fuck them niggas) Light off (Im Back) X 2


With the bone like king
Fuck the brightling plan MC bright on
Got these niggas by they neck
You can't stop it, you can't knock it
Walk with no no camera
Early in the building catch your homey in this

I was taught to keep it G, never took tales
Pistol in my hand, swear im going through hell
Real nigga shit, sick of taking the ill
If I dont make it home, somebody go get my bill
Lights off, lights off, where them niggas at
Lights off, lights off, I ain't feelin' that
Lights off (Real shit), Lights off (here to get it back)
Lights off (Fuck them niggas) Light off (Im Back) X 2
