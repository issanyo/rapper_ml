[Intro] [Freeway talking]
Yeah. I'mma talk y'all back to first album. When I had a song "I cry"...that goes, when you hear the song, you should cry. You know you wrong when you cry. Well this time around...I'mma break it down to y'all a few times in my life I had to cry. It's just grown man shit. Real rap. Let's go

[Verse One]
When I was diaper switchin'
First time my G.I. Joe's was missin'
First ass whippin'
The first time I seen a grown man die
And I ain't know the reason why my grandpa Carter left me
A few years past the grandma Carter left me
Wish that I could bring 'em back, swap it out, use the barter system
Would've traded all my arcade games
My Nintendo and Colecovision
Just to see 'em livin'
When I finally realized that they died upon the wrong religion
I hope Allah forgive 'em
Hope Allah forgive us all for sinnin'
But repenters get the recognition
It's just a gift from God
I'm just a slave but God can't deny
There's just a few things to make a grown man cry
And in return a few things to make a grown man wise
I'm not just spittin' I'm live full, I'm readin' the scriptures
Y'all niggas dick ride, I know things

[Hook]
"I cry"

[Verse Two]
When my man Neff ran in the store to take down
And in return got his soul took, his body shook
I still keep him in my prayers right now
But every chapter is decreed by God, it's a closed book
I cried when I see my son come out the womb
Will he grow to be strong, only time can tell
I cried when I couldn't see my daughter come out womb
I was locked in the cold room, a jail cell
When a few more friends fell
Twiz gone, Griz gone, Shateek, Chubs as well
When I see my cousin Emily's face
At my cousin Ethan funeral
I couldn't keep composure, I kept thinkin' over and over
Eventually, one day we gon' be in his place
And the only thing you take is your deeds to your grave
I hope my good deeds outweigh my bad ones
The day that this raft come we stuck and doomed, it's a rat race
Yup!

[Hook]
