[Verse 1: Tek]
If you love me say you love me man
Don’t wait till I’m gone to say you love me fam
‘cause when it's said and done then you said nothing
You gonna be wishin that you woulda said something
I can’t smell the trees when I’m six feet deep
In the box with dirt with thrown on top of me
Why you wanna wait till I'm not breathing
To cry on my chest, and tell me how you was feeling
You say I tell em let em see me at my best
But you not knowing how much time is left
You keep saying "When I get round to it"
But they say the same thing so nobody ever do it
I’ve been through it, wishing I could take it back
Turn the clock back, to where we fell out at
If I could I'd part waters like Moses
And give you dozens while you can still smell the roses

[Hook: Freeway] [x2]
Still got love here you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, travel where my brothers go
But when the all love gone we wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to whom my brothers pray to

[Verse 2: Tek & Steele]
[Tek] Just think, if B.I.G and Pac made peace
[Steele] ...and you could say something to both of em, what would it be?
[Tek] What about your brother just got murdered?
[Steele] When you was crying saying sorry do you think that he heard it?
[Tek] For seven years, sisters not speaking
[Steele] A car accident claim one and now the other tweaking
[Tek] One cousins killed the next over three Ki's
[Steele] That sound like rich and Po if you ask me
[Tek] Mother and daughter at each others’ throat
[Steele] Daughter get raped
[Tek] ... mother can't cope
Never said sorry, before they left home
[Steele] She felt she ruined her life so she took her own
[Tek] Now daddy fucked up, drugs gettin sucked up
[Steele] He got a gran baby that he gotta raise up
[Tek] If I could I'd part waters like Moses
[Tek & Steele] And give you dozens while you can still smell the roses

[Hook: Freeway] [x2]
Still got love here you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, travel where my brothers go
But when all the love gone we wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to whom my brothers pray to

[Verse 3: Steele]
Bismi Allah al-rahmam al-rahim
My life’s real but sometimes it seems like a dream
My ahki advised me to stay up on my deems
Give thanks for what I got, go hard for what I need
Drink fast no time to eat
We in this together like two feet, knee deep, til we decease
Some say the honors out here in these streets
Who’s heart is pure, who's sure about his own peeps
My friends and my fam give ohms to eat
Cause when they gone to sleep we moan and weep
But while they still on their feet, salute when we greet
That's how soldier show respect when they troop to the beat
If I never say the words it ain't cuz I ain’t mean it
You can judge by my deeds that I pledge my allegience
If I could I'd part waters like Moses
And give you dozens while you can still smell the roses

[Hook: Freeway] [x2]
Still got love here you thought all the love was gone
I do what my brothers do, travel where my brothers go
But when all the love gone we wish that the love would stay
I do what my brothers do, pray to whom my brothers pray to
