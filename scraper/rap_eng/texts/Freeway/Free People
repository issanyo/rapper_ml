[Hook - Sample] (Freeway)
We are people, who've been tried through time (that's right)
Rejected by society (not just black people but people in general)
Left to wander deaf, dumb and blind (ya know)
We know the depth of darkness, ignorance's shame (uh huh)
A people lost without a name (Free)
Without a name, ohhh, what a shame
But now here we are ...

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
Yeah, this how it started, the beginning it was me alone
It's '09, I look around, it's me alone
Huh, no "Love Jones", No Nia Long
And my kids still askin "are we there yet?
Did we make it to the top dad?"
"My bad
We just made it to the middle, gettin paid a little
So you know what that means, y'all could play a little
But I still gotta work a lot, close the locks"
Niggas see me on the tube, they think I'm worth a lot
And if they try to take y'all, I'm gonna murk the block
Pull out and squirt the block, hurt the block
I don't care if I alert the cops, call the S.W.A.T
When I blast, bodies drop like Pilates class
Throw on the mask, then I palm the Glock
If y'all niggas try to hide, I'm a find ya ass

[Hook - Sample] (Freeway)
We are people, who've been tried through time
Rejected by society (I'm tempted)
Left to wander deaf, dumb and blind (know what I mean)
We know the depth of darkness, ignorance's shame
(How I'm supposed to react?)
A people lost without a name (uh huh)
Without a name, ohh, what a shame
But now here we are ...

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
Here we are, face to face, we didn't grow with no silver spoons
Hopin to find, a strip we can grind on
A connect we can rely on, my God
Philly Freezer used to hustle on the block
Listenin to songs on the tape deck before the iPod
Yeah, some niggas used to grind hard
While other niggas used to take checks
Niggas that grind had it out with the cops
Niggas that took checks, faced a quick death
They was shootin out 'til not a clip left
Wind up goin out in a box
And I wind up rollin out in a box Porsche
'Lo sport from the shorts to the socks to the shirt
Yeah, I'm gonna make this rap thing work, watch

[Hook - Sample] (Freeway)
We are people (that's right), who've been tried through time
(Trials and tribulations)
Rejected by society
Left to wander deaf, dumb and blind (just wakin up)
We know the depth of darkness
(Goin through your normal day is a trial)
Ignorance's shame (it's all a test)
A people lost (from God) without a name (you gotta find yourself)
Without a name, ohh, what a shame (that's right)
But now here we are ...
