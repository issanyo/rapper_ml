[Verse 1: The Jacka]
You only crying cause you know you wrong
So many tears turned your heart into stone
I bet you'll think about me when i'm gone
Got rich and I ain't have to sell my soul
I don't think, I pray Allah will get me through
Insha'Allah, is not haram in my songs
If so we leading everybody on
Maricon, vende coca
Got caught up can't believe everything you told 'em
What, did I ever do? I guess it's in your plans
No better planner than you, I take it on the chin
Lee lost a case, he won't come home again
I'll never forget you'll always be the nigg
In my eyes these guys blind to the life we in

[Hook]
Money got me missing Salat
Somebody pray for me
I’m with Jacka and Freeway, You better bring a K for me
MTM, me and Rydah gone cake money
I got a nigga in every state that’ll spray for me
It ain’t a nigga on earth took a grape from me
.45 HK Trey Eight on Me
Cause all a pussy nigga ever do is hate on me
Gun language no talking you gone have to show me

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Whether, rapping or trapping i'm making it work
If a nigga disrespect me put his face in the dirt
We be moving with them weapons any place on the Earth
Have a bully scared to even show his face on this turf
This is game time and we can ball like Nerf
I will pop you so I get to see the law at work
When they, rush to get you fucking with Philly Freezer
He will leave you when he bust his pistol
I'm talking third person but i'm the only person
That'll hit you and'll spit you till the bone drizzle
And I ain't got to borrow I got my own pistol
Then your grandpa's down take Jerome with you
Yall need to know that i'm Numero Uno (?)
And chicks come to me I don't whistle
And if you diss me then i'm gone get you
I'm like the Army cause i'm riding for the whole mission
