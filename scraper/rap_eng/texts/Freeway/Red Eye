[Verse 1 – Young Chris]
Get accustomed to this thing called life
Gotta hustle, gotta sling all night
Ambition to gunner, right back see my vision 100
Strike back till they give him another
When the devil get to lurking, never had a B I couldn’t burden
Swerving, bombed out suburban, tryna snatch the paper
Selling crack to neighbors, got my niggas some mountains
Where the rednecks hate us
Where only shakes can save us
Scrape the wax, scrape you’re whack
[?] at all times if you tryna make it back
They just want the story of my life
But I can’t fit it all in one k (right)
Send some pictures of some bitches
Gotta pay em a visit
[?] promise niggas never say I ain’t did it
Jay dug a nigga’s style since they brought me to him
Got to hustle like Russell since they taught me to swim
True champion, I’m watching the film
While y’all party Imma hop in the gym
Caught watching the rim
Kelly and Seagal nigga, all the above
The desert eagle Leave em all in your mug
Niggas wonder how I got out the dirt
Even the boss is even watching me work
I ain’t live out the dream, 16 like a [?] of work
Pack it up, hit the block let it twerk
I’m like the block and the dirt
Blood diamond with a Glock on my turf
I get the choppa get the [?] shit first
Take the hearse to the church
Die slow, getting murked ain’t the worst
Take this fully loaded clip and the curse
Imagine making a nurse
“Hi doc”, white socks and night socks
Every day a month, early fore the mice drop
Every day I burn it down until the mic’s hot
Go down till the last seconds like a Mike shot
Ha,  Ferragamo on my new buckle
[?] on my new sneaker
I’m alive it’s a new day
Motherfucker it’s a new leader

I want the money, movies, endorsements, sponsorships
You niggas in my way you getting rolled on

[Bridge – Freeway][x2]
Bringing  gunna, you’re still seeing the hunger
Lot of money, few bad bitches among us
I’m a titan that’s residing in the jungle
Be warned then I’m striking with the lightning and the thunder

[Verse 2 – Freeway]
I’m a king like Posiden, and the flow like water
What you selling I ain’t buying, we know the numbers
What you writing ain’t exciting, what you writing don’t enlighten
The people, in fact it might make them dumber
My music motivates, it makes people wanna
Get up get out, and get something like the dungeon
Family, these hating niggas dream about surrounding me
Dream bout four pounding me, and wake up and suffer
While I wake up and hustle, from North Philly but I been in Europe all summer
Don’t get it twisted, I ain’t spending, I’m collecting
Get the model bitches naked and I give them all lumber
My IG name and the wrong number
Yea I achieve fame but I stay humble
Yea I made millions and I ain’t change
If I ain’t got my stainless I’m gon rumble
Bitch I’m a king, so that’s a royal rumble
Young heart throb, I’ll make your daughters rumble
When I step on stage I hear the crowd rumble
I’m tryna see Pacquiao and Money May rumble
Then I bet a 100k on they rumble
Put it all on Floyd, he the champ bitch
Out the hamp this week cold lamp bitch
Got 99 problems no girl trouble
Me and C hris, [?] came to bring the real trouble
If she can take two, well you know the rest
Big ass mansion, no air dress
2014, no car trouble
If I bubble them we all bubble
Philly freezer been the shit since the bubblex
Me and C up working while the others rest
It’s gunna season, we about to give you stars trouble
Yes
