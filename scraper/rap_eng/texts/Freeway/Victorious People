SOMEWHERE IN MY LIFE
I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICES
LISTENED TO MYSELF
OBEYED DIVINE VOICES
COINCIDENCES-
SEE I PERCEIVE EXTENSIONS
OF MYSELF COME PEEP MY LESSONS
WITHOUT PRETENSIONS
BARE KNUCKLE
BONE TO BONE
I KNOW MY FAITH GOING TO
LEAD ME HOME SO I ROAM
LONG GONE-
FROM MOUNTAIN LEAPING-
WIDE AWAKE NO TIME
FOR SLEEPING-
WE SEEKING-
(GROUCH)
I FEEL LIKE A MILLION BUCKS BUT I AIN'T IN A TUX
IT'S NATURAL AND RAW, STRIP IT DOWN
TO THE CORE, IT'S PURE YET DELUXE
NAH IT AIN'T STUCK, IN YOUR TOWN, Y'ALL GET IT NOW
DON'T RUN THE RACE, WE RUN THE GLOBE
FRIEND OR FOE, I AIN'T GOTTA HATE, I JUST SPIT IT PROUD
CELEBRATE A WINNING ATTITUDE AND SUCCESS
ONE BY ITSELF DON'T EXIST, GIVE IT UP! YES!

(CHORUS)
THE TIME IS NOW, GET DOWN, VICTORIOUS PEOPLE
HEAD HIGH, FISTS UP, STAND PROUD, VICTORIOUS PEOPLE
WINNIN' RIGHT NOW WE WINNIN' RIGHT NOW (X4)
(FREEWAY)
UH, YEAH, PHILLY FREEZER THE FLOW'S COLD
NO PRETENDER, I'M THE WINNER ALL YEAR, NORTH POLE
IN FACT YOU COULD LABEL ME THE RICK JAMES OF RAP
I WORK HARD TO BRING Y'ALL EARS PURE SOUL
SOUL OF THE LOST SLAVES, NOT PHASED BY THE FAME
NOT DAZED BY THE SPARKLING CHAINS AND SOLID GOLD
SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS, PASSED CLASS MADE THE HONOR ROLL
NOW IT'S TIME TO CONQUER MY GOALS, MAKE A LOT OF CASH
VICTORIOUS, WE RIP AUDIENCES, WE GET BANK ROLLS, FANS GET AUTOGRAPHS
WE GLORIOUS, CAUSE WE BRING AUDIENCES REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES WORTH MUCH MORE THAN MATH
YEAH, LET ME ADD IT UP, PHILIDELPHIA FREEWAY, FREE AT LAST WAS ON REPLAY
STIM PACK BROUGHT HIP HOP BACK NO DELAY
DIAMOND IN THE RUFF, NEXT UP, YOU COULD TRUST IT'S TUFF

(CHORUS)
THE TIME IS NOW, GET DOWN, VICTORIOUS PEOPLE
HEAD HIGH, FISTS UP, STAND PROUD, VICTORIOUS PEOPLE
WINNIN' RIGHT NOW WE WINNIN' RIGHT NOW (X4)
(GROUCH)
GONNA BUILD A FAMILY WITH GREATS THAT KNOW ME
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO CRY WHEN WE TAKE THE TROPHY
TEAM SPIRIT, THANK THOSE BEFORE ME
LIKE ROBERT MARLEY AND MY MOMMA SURELY
WOMEN SUPPORT ME, MEN ADORE ME
IF THEY CAN'T SHOW IT THEY PRETEND TO IGNORE ME
NOW I AIN'T THE ANTHONY ROBBINS OF CRAP
BUT IF YOU AIN'T MOTIVATED BY THIS IT'S A WRAP
(ZUMBI)
