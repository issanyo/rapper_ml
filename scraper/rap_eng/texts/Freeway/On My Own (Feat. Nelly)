It's because I'm all on my own, now
But you can leave him out hear alone, now
And y'all really need to watch your tone
You see the chrome before I blast it for ya
I'm a blast it for ya
It's because I'm all on my own, now
But you can leave him out hear alone, now
And y'all really need to watch your tone
You see the chrome before I blast it for ya
I'm a blast it for ya
It's freeway all by myself, I'm in da place all on my own
In da club wit the chrome while y'all nigga's gotta leave it at home
Y'all haters better leave it alone before you meet wit ya death
Back up off me, put ya keys in the ignition
Start the rolling gap, scrap, befoe I clap
Bang out like a western, found out where you live at
Pay ya spot a visit
Listen, free to frosty, back up off me
Before you get buried, carry the mover
Extra rounds to get the clowns up off me
Y'all act scary, you act like losers, check, check
State Prop in ya neighborhood
Roc in ya spot, spot Roc when you let us in
Free got things locked in ya neighborhood
Roc's on ya block, free servin' they medicine
It's because I'm all on my own, now
But you can leave him out hear alone, now
And y'all really need to watch your tone
You see the chrome before I blast it for ya
I'm a blast it for ya
It's because I'm all on my own, now
But you can leave him out hear alone, now
And y'all really need to watch your tone
You see the chrome before I blast it for ya
I'm a blast it for ya
Roofless like a shot from a cannon
Free is in affect and will stayin' datin'
Y'all, baby mommas should have warned you
'Cause they seen it on the bed when she came over the crib
Now you don't really wanna get the K involved
'Cause you were gonna with, us lookin' at your head
The whole click pull chicks don't brag
Tell 'em freeway sad if it ain't 'bout head, go 'head
You think it's 'bout change, go change
Put on ya shit, hop in a cab
Mean while free stuck in a lab
Earning my grip, youngin's huggin' the strip
Freeway move rhymes like dimes move hits like nicks
On ya mind like all the time
On ya station like heavy rotation
Used to be on a grind like on the line
It's because I'm all on my own, now
But you can leave him out hear alone, now
And y'all really need to watch your tone
You see the chrome before I blast it for ya
I'm a blast it for ya
It's because I'm all on my own, now
But you can leave him out hear alone, now
And y'all really need to watch your tone
You see the chrome before I blast it for ya
I'm a blast it for ya
Bee bop at the Roc we don't stop
Boom boom Tang my gang we move thangs
And I put up the range, the hoopty flow through ya block
The ice cover my watch ya eyes stuck on the change
What you thought it's the Roc wit my people from St. Lou
Jack Frost, Jack Frost up in the bango, the wrist froze
Grip O's, Roc-a-Fella pit bull snatch every bitch on ya block
Y'all prick need to back up off me
Keep ya distance, 'cause my smithin' on service
What's ya order slugs on the menu
Shut the shop down on purpose, work this
Four-fifth like I'm runin' for prez
I peel lead have you runin' from shots
Go tell ya block, ya block start wit the kid
Kid kidnap ya pops
It's because I'm all on my own, now
But you can leave him out hear alone, now
And y'all really need to watch your tone
You see the chrome before I blast it for ya
I'm a blast it for ya
It's because I'm all on my own, now
But you can leave him out hear alone, now
And y'all really need to watch your tone
You see the chrome before I blast it for ya
I'm a blast it for ya
Shit back up off me
Keep ya distance, 'cause my smithin' on service
What's ya order slugs on the menu
Shut the shop down on purpose, work this
