[Intro: P.Diddy]
As we proceed (Yeah yeah yeah yeah) to give you what you need
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah) Yeah, it's gettin hot in here!
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah) Oh! It's gettin hot in here! Missy!

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott] (P.Diddy)
(Wooo hoooo!) Dag it's hot (I like this)
Must have been Missy comin up in the spot
How many times I'm a tell you to stop
If me and Faith on the track artist don't wanna drop
Now c-c-come on move your feet
Let's slide to the flo' when ya hear this beat
Let's shake it like a pro (oh) gimme what you got
This is gonna blow when you play it in your box

[Faith Evans]
Sometimes you can be in love and having fun
And still not know what's goin on (No)
Or on the other hand you separate, thinkin that the feelin's gone
Feels like forever when were together, I knew that we are destiny
So here's the last chance for the last dance
For us to bring back the dream

[Hook 1: Faith Evans]
So baby come and rescue me (I'm burnin up!)
I got somethin' for you to see (I'm burnin up!)
Baby come and take me there (I'm burnin up!)
Trust me you should (Hurry up!) Baby I'm just (burnin up! burnin up!)

[Verse 2: Missy] (P.Diddy)
(It's gettin hot in here!!!)
I'm burnin up like a match (Missy: Match) layin on my back (Missy: Back)
Thirty eight deezy a that's just baby fat
Why you so upset? Cause you want some putty cat
You bought no jimmy hat no way don't gimme that
Yeah I want you back, so can I have you back
Those size twelve feet explains what's in your slacks
I know this for a fact, I love the way you mack
Can you rescue me? Ay yo Faith where you at?

[Beat Switches to JustBlaze version]

[Freeway]
Bad Boy, Roc-A-Fella, this is the remix!
Faith! Free! Just Blaze!

[Hook 2: Faith Evans]
Burnin up, my heart is like burnin up
Things you do got my heart startin a fire (yess it isss)
I'm on fire!
Burnin up, my heart is like burnin up
Things you do got my heart startin a fire (I'm on firreee)

[Faith Evans]
Feels like forever, when we're together
You are my destiny
You got me in this position
And my hearts not in the condition
Your my desire, smells like a fire
Baby come rescue me
So baby bring back the dreaaamm
Just come and rescue meee
I'm on fire!

[Verse 3: Freeway (Faith)]
Shes burnin up!
If I hit her with a Cardier it'll cool her down
Its the Roc miss, gonna skip work or what?
On time when you clock and I can hold you down (I'm on fire!)
Still on fire I'mma hold you down
Soak you up, go round for round
Yeaaahhh she Just Blazin, ain't that amazin
She claimin she don't know the sound (I'm on fire!)
But she feelin the kid
Don't care how it starts
Just when I'm floatin the pound
Into the crib, we can just dance, dance, dance
All night in the dark
You like that? Yeaaahhh
On the right track yeah
How you want me to bite that? Ma I'll be right back
When the jokin stops, Faith, Just Blaze and Free
Bad Boy and the Roc

[Outro: Faith Evans]
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
Things you do got my heart startin a fire
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
Things you do got my heart startin a fire
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
Things you do got my heart startin a fire
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
Things you do got my heart startin a fire
Burning up! My heart is like burnin up!
Things you do got my heart startin a fire
