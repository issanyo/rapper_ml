Y’all niggas better wake up on time
Set your alarm clocks cause you know we bout the grind
Man y’all boys ain’t bout it, ain’t dollar
Got the 40 rack stacks boy, bout to take yours and mines, yeah
How you do it, early, when you do it, early
I was born up on the streets, I was influenced early
If I take you on a date we gotta do it early
Y’all niggas running late, I get that paper early
Wake that ass up, go wash up
If you must … if you not then don’t never pass up
Try to get your cash up
We are block boys tryina get a fast buck
Cop to us, cops get, nervous when they pass us
Some of us are eating on a rumble, we are not norry
They looking for us with the guns but we are not worried
Catch the bastards in traffic
Get that ass up, get smacked up, tryina act up
Get clapped, motherfuckers better back up
Kidnap motherfuckers with the rope
I don’t ….road crash, motherfuckers with a match
Light motherfuckers with a match
Throw rounds now they scraping motherfuckers off the ground with the spatula
Hoe, y’all preparing for the rapture, rappers
Cause all of y’all have a …after, pe juice got like black thorn…
Will smith stay proud, rappers actors
…if they say nah, make em say so
Step on they toes, get in they face
I don’t care if you by yourself in Miami with a chick going vacate
Jump on payphone, click on day way
You know how philly niggas do with grip on ak
Jump on e way, bricks in the rental transport them like a limo
Get em there no delay
And if he’s cool, there’s no prepay
When I get it to them only thing that he say is
How you do it, early, when you do it, early
I was born up on the streets, I was influenced early
If I take you on a date we gotta do it early
Y’all niggas running late, I get that paper early
This is hip hop, I wish I could stop
Louie lenses, no …you don’t know me
But she just play karaoke in my bloke
I told her to keep going, give me everything you knowing
…you should do this for a dollar
Could you do this for a hour, if you good you make me holler
She said my anaconda is to much for her swallow
Big thing dropper nigga just think prada
Move way, whole lot of case inside of
Where hot niggas only say 10 harder
Johnson and Johnson nigga take man powder
Beg man, if I got the apron, wanna see …
Talk shit, better have your A6 on
Watch you run up, then watch the blood run down you
Coke 4 pound you, chris and snoop you
Pouring loud on you so the smell won’t travel
I play chess and checkers, I play scrabble
That’s why I’m competing with the leaders of the new cool
Leader of the flow, always hit you with the new …
Pina butter chicken snitch police my favorite
Mami try to hit me, she on my pager
Never ever date her, fuck her shake her, that’s my new move
Shawty let me pop her, said I’m chopping like a yuhu
And she is addicted, always watching me on youtube
Man we handle bindess and we wailing in the hood or…
How you do it, early, when you do it, early
I was born up on the streets, I was influenced early
If I take you on a date we gotta do it early
Y’all niggas running late, I get that paper early
