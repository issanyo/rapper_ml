Is not too many, not too many that our sick them with the flow
Is not too many, not too many that our gift it with the lyrics
Nah uh, nah uh nah uh nah uh nah uh nah uh nah uh nah uh
Is not too many, not too many that our really getting dough
Is not too many, not too many that our eating off this music
Nah uh, nah uh nah uh nah uh nah uh nah uh nah uh nah uh
Ne-never tuss nigga that will never press
And we long to see our Lord so we cheer as death
Used to be another cora with price
Being the
, being Mustanza, being the fore
Tors with the tors, my music is real life experience
This choices are course where in the USS are card
People be
Promote us kind court us
Over large bodies or water to get the money
Just so we can feed the visa, pay the mortgage
And stay gorgeous, I got bank so my diamond link flawless
Same shit sweet, reason bring their heat ain't August
Think July, think June, when you're talking case that in your tunes
I think you lie, and other people like free we think you right
He ain't real as I, hey
We are an addable, your rap is pitiful
Serve you 'cause sweet all we are spitibul
Rap game is the new crack game we go in digital
Ride with mike rock the bike bitch hit the bull
One click I'm in to do, one trip, one flip I have the soon the sunset
Strip let's get a boo
You ain't got a chick like mine you'd better get a boo
She's unforgettable, we're under sheets on the streets
I'm the watch
She still to move
You but she still got them killer moves
She stand free
A nigga get out of line, not kill a fool
Exclusive shit, Louie back come a fool
And she ain't have to post the shit
Have a coop but
Tryin to teach east lime she said I'm fine
I'm a do quick dime, for lips still leave
Make dime from time to time
She ask I told the eyes do
If not too many, not too many, not too many that are gifted
The ink strighten depends on lifted
You wanna the opportunity so you pray for it, you owe for it
You wished it, and not turned you in one turn
But only when you get it which mean money get miss it
If you ain't get it the you might be one of the hundred that missed it
And so you missed it, I'm gifted
The flow just like that water profit know where I'm gone
And thing water that moods, the party and Jesus walk on em
I got them MA, SSI SSI, PPI, river flow on my way to river
The bank to get the Franklins
Count em their back and the bank in company
And shot then I bang and I think God fro free way
You get that
To need way, then I hit that M way back way G way
I'm so sophisticated, I've never fit into
Way
And she say 'cause he say what she say if Vicky we free way
