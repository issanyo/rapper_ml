If it ain’t money then you get to be (alone)
She hit the weed and then she fell asleep (smoke)
Yeah, it’s only OG that he selling me
She wanna fuck what she keep telling me
Yeah, I’m driving fast, I let the swisher burn
I’m a pimp, she got to wait her turn
Yeah, oh she mad, she need to understand
That my lifestyle 100 grand

[Verse 1]
The way I smoke a pound on the dresser
I’m a pimp, feel like Hugh Hefner
Chanel chains cover up my body
KTZ and all this came from Kwazi
I got the juice and I can’t keep em off me
How these bitches end up in the lobby?
Wake and bake then sip my coffee
Bitches bad, she got a softy
They see the sleeves and ask me what it cost me
What the record label toss me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
30 thousand dollars on the floor
I wear em once and then they out the door
Call me anything but never poor
I beat her twice and now she say she sore
Why they question what I fucking wear?
I spent a thousand on my underwear
Bitches all talk and share
Tell my dog to pick a pair
I bet they leave with you
Give you head and smoke some weed with you
