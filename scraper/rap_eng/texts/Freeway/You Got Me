[Intro: Mariah Carey]
Y-y-you (Ooooh)
Y-y-you
Ahh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Mmm)
You know you got me, yeah
You know you got me, uh-huh-huh-huh
You know you got me, yeah
You know you got me

[Verse 1: Freeway & Mariah Carey]
Uh, it's Mariah and Free
Just Blaze beats, yeah
It's the Roc and Mariah and the women go (Oh)
And I love it when the ladies sing
And they love it when the whistles blow over the ring
Slide upon ya strip and go
Just to pick up ya sister bro
You like to pick and choose who she dates
While I state who I like to stick and move
Silly fool, she know that I got her
I'll run up on the strip and go
For Mariah play a brother role
I'll play a different role
Let her roll in the wheel, long days nowhere to go
And no other slimie will do
She just like honey so she got me like Winnie the Pooh
Long nights let her chill with the crew
Only backwards will do and she know how to roll
They say out with the old and in with the new
But she's my dreamlover so I can't let go, hey, no
Please believe me, I've never been a liar
Touch fire Mariah and Free-weezy

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I get shy around you
Don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
'Cause you do something to me
That I can't describe, baby
Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby, it's true

[Chorus]
You know you got me (So in love)
You know you got me (Daydreamin' about us)
You know you got me (Starry eyed and elated)
You know you got me (Whenever you want me, baby)
You know you got me (Hypnotized)
You know you got me (With you on my mind)
You know you got me (Feeling intoxicated)
You know you got me (Whenever you want me, baby)

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
Boy, I'm entangled up in you
These feelings I just can't elude
'Cause you're so captivating
That I inadvertently
Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby, it's true

[Chorus]
You know you got me (So in love)
You know you got me (Daydreamin' about us)
You know you got me (Starry eyed and elated)
You know you got me (Whenever you want me, baby)
You know you got me (Hypnotized)
You know you got me (With you on my mind)
You know you got me (Feeling intoxicated)
You know you got me (Whenever you want me, baby)

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Mami, got me, buying property
Speeding too fast, high velocity
Coppin' bracelets, baby rock piece
Vacay, Saint-Tropez and Capri
And usually I be on my shit
Harlem Shakin' these groupies off me quick
But this time it's diff
Think the love gon' stick
Like Velcro, let go, hell no
Ma, you know you got me

[Verse 5: Mariah Carey]
Said I'm insecure when I'm around you
Don't know what to say or to do
Catching feelings boy, in spite of myself
I can't think of nobody else, sugar
You're the star of all my dreams
I just wanna be your everything
Boy you know you really got me
Baby, yeah

[Chorus]
You know you got me (So in love)
You know you got me (Daydreamin' about us)
You know you got me (Starry eyed and elated)
You know you got me (Whenever you want me, baby)
You know you got me (Hypnotized)
You know you got me (With you on my mind)
You know you got me (Feeling intoxicated)
You know you got me (Whenever you want me, baby)
You know you got me (So in love)
You know you got me (Daydreamin' about us)
You know you got me (Starry eyed and elated)
You know you got me (Whenever you want me, baby)
You know you got me (Hypnotized)
You know you got me (With you on my mind)
You know you got me (Feeling intoxicated)
You know you got me (Whenever you want me, baby)
