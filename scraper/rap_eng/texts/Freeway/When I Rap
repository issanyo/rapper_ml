[Hook]
When I rap, niggas want me to rap again
These niggas wack, when they rap I laugh at them
Their CDs is trash
Give out headaches, shoulda came with aspirin
When I rap, niggas want me to rap again
These niggas wack, when they rap I laugh at them
Their CDs is ass
Toilet seat, shoulda took a crap on them

[Verse 1]
Want to know where the hell I've been?
In the stu' making hits, on the highway trafficking
Back in the lab with Mac again
Hot 97 bars -- we're going back-to-back again
Who said my flow ain't the best?
My Intratec turn foes to vegetables
Y'all dudes ain't thugs, y'all Huxtables
Y'all want me waiting outside your vestibule?
How do you like Mya/Jay-Z?
My .380 get the best of you
Guy, if a nigga survive
I come back with the streetsweeper, hit the rest of you
Yup, I make a mess of you
Closed casket cause your family'll hate the view
Only time y'all fake-ass rappers gonna make it on the tube
When I make y'all make the news
Y'all know I'm making moves
Free money, Oprah money, Free equate the two
Put y'all niggas to sleep
Hope the pastor awake -- he got a brand-new wake to do
I'm the man y'all hate to love
Motherfuckers probably hate me cause
I'm in the lab all night, in the lab all day
That's the shit y'all hate to do
Niggas can't flow like Freezer, go like Free
Get the dough like Freezer
If I take 'em off, leave 'em in the room
Y'all niggas still can't seem to feel to take my shoes
But still I gots to prove
Like M.J., I gots the moves
Balling or dancing -- I go to Fif' crib, get lost in the mansion
Come to my crib, get murdered in the suburbs
Take cash, get blast with the Mossberg
Bag 'em, toe-tag 'em
Then toss 'em in the earth

[Hook]

I'm gonna obey y'all thirst
Since you want another verse cause y'all want me to rap again
Philly Freezer back like Sprite again
Like Sean Paul, y'all gotta give me a light again
But I don't smoke, don't pass the dro to him
Smoke MC's, you could bring me a bowl of them
They're like African slaves to him
I'm a Pilgrim, I'll be happy to bait 'em in
Where's my plate?
MC's get ate, I don't care if there's eight of them
Or eighteen hundred; two pairs of Louis cost eighteen hundred
Free so fly -- that's why your chick always suck me off
And she tell me, "Don't stop, keep coming"
So I keep coming, flow keep coming
Freezer need dough like Phillip Drummond
Y'all my adopted sons like Arnold, Willis
I'm a six series wheeler
Used to be on times with mine but
As of now I'm a retired dealer
But I still fire on niggas
These niggas too sneaky, keep an eye on niggas
Like I said, I smoke MC's
So I get high off niggas

[Hook]
