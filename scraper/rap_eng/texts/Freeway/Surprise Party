Don't nothin' beat a failure but to try
It's a tragedy, the agony of defeat
Left a bitter taste in his mouth
Revenge could be as sweet as it is sour
Took what was rightfully ours
I see no bravery that's why he died the death of a coward
Shot him dead in his face in front of his baby mama
I sat there waiting patient, he had me waitin' for hours
The later it got, the more it made me hotter
I'm finna reacquaint him with this bitch he know named Karma
A pretty bitch plenty niggas hit
You get what you get and he got what he had comin' to 'em
Four-five Glock let the ACP cut into him
Tell him me and my man bullet finna bump into him
On the sneak tip, seen him
Put 'em through him, fed him the four-fifth and left his whole shit in ruins
That's my story and I'm stickin' to it
Could have paid a nigga to do it
But I'd rather I do the shootin'

[Hook]
Overkill, just like my pops taught me
So don't you double-dip, ever try to double cross me
Never
For niggas try'na get one up on me
I keep somethin' that'll get them the fuck up off me
See that nigga over there with the ice Carty's
He don't know, we 'bout to throw him a surprise party
Your life is at stake and once he bite the bait
That's the icing on the cake
I'm bout to throw him a surprise party

[King Chip]
My young nigga Moochie hit me up
Said the police set him up
Said he need a couple bucks
Said he dropped a four fifth up in the bushes when he ran
Said he cut his leg hoppin' the fence, well god damn
Said the jungle ain't been no joke since I moved out here to Cali
Robbin' niggas just to get some food for the family
He said Chip, if you need something done then get at me
He said Chip, if you need niggas head buss' then get at me
I dapped my nigga up and said I got you if you got me
That's loyal, I got five racks in the address for you
I know my nigga would do it for way less than that
But even Scarface got five to peel a nigga back
I told him have a bitch film it and send it to me
I'ma be out the country, nigga gettin' money
Meanwhile five guys with nines
Run up on you and your girl at Five Guys with fries
Surprise

Okay, Free!
Unh
Niggas is sheisty, my wrist icy but the game cold
And my bitch is trify she change season but remain wifey
Same old G, I've been a king, she stands by me
These niggas jealous and they relishing the thought of trying me
Want to get beside of me to sit hot ones inside of me
Carry out they plans of robbing me, don't care if I'm a commodity
I am honestly tired of the hate that I'm receiving
I'ma call 'em up this evening and throw everyone a surprise party
Same room, same time, I'm the same goon with the same mind
Two of them are brothers, got the same dad, same mom
So sad, drop bombs like Baghdad
The semi-automatic got a kickback like Hi-Ya!
So try 'em, come on and try Freezer, and come on and get your die on
Your mama get her cry on, your body'll rest in peace
Yup your corpse'll get your lie on
I will cock back and squeeze, that you can rely on
