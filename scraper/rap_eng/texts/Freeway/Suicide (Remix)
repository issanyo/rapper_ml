[Freeway:]
Suicide remix!
Team early!
ASAP mob!

[Hook: Freeway]
It’s a suicide, it’s a suicide
Fuckin’ with my crew and I, it’s a suicide
It’s a suicide, it’s a suicide
Fuckin’ with my crew and I, it’s a suicide
It’s a suicide, came here to blow
I’m talkin’ three squads and four years ago, prepared to flow nigga
It’s a suicide, came here to blow
I’m talkin’ three squads and four years ago, prepared to flow

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
This is sewer manure flow
Scuba in my poolo flow
Gangster, like the Yakuza eating a tuna roll
Equivalent to a crew of crip niggas who doobie roll
Suggest you don’t stick out your chest like Janet at Super Bowl
I almost killed them
First you can recoup and then go regroup and get your crew
And hopefully I can just do a show
Told her we finished, yeah let the game pollute your soul
He was worried about all the fame and the groupie hoes
Big chains, talkin’ bout cocaine that you done sold
You ain’t sell a damn thing, he was just ramping
But back to this genocide, I mean suicide
You can kill the world with your words, I’ll let you decide
Just some food for thought, nigga
But back to these new jewels that I bought nigga
Yeah, talk about my diamonds, how they frost nigga
This a suicide for you lost niggas

[Hook]

[KRS-One Sample:]
Suicide, it’s a suicide buda bye bye
Suicide, it’s a suicide eh
Suicide, it’s a suicide buda bye bye
Suicide, it’s a suicide

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Tell them haters to die slow
Fuck a convo
I let the nine blow from the five-oh
I’m a motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you’re a witness of a killing
You heard the fuss we threw at major, put you in the minor leagues
Most murderers, I been killin’ this since “The Dynasty”
Rappers they catchin’ by these [?] and burglaries
Mans try to clap you ASAP, we got Ferg with us
It can get ugly as Shabba Ranks, you mess with us
Ridin’ with your man, I’ll put you in the church with him
A hearse with him, put you on a “rest in peace” shirt with him
Blast you like NASA, I’ll take you off the earth with him
Ghost like Casper, drop the ax into my turf again
Saw me on the block, they swore I was moving work again
Foreign the baby, some lady’s giving birth again
Send bodies to the city morgue like I work for them, I’m hurtin’ them

[Hook]
