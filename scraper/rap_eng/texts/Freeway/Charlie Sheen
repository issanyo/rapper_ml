[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Ugh, yeah, alright, shit hard as fuck
Ugh, look, hustle, all I do is rap about the fast life
You can’t relate, you need to get your cash right
I must have been a flashlight, in my past life
Cause all I do is shine, so blow me like a bagpipe
Wood, grains, grams and gold chainz
I’m shutting down traffic I’m switching 4 lanes
I’m hanging out the window every which way
Every nigga not a pimp but every bitch pay
I’m hard on these hoes like every single day
And I got a lot of bitches in every different states
I get a lot of pussy but I never got to pay
And all money is in all a nigga gotta say look
Now one time for my young grind
I spend hundreds, I smoke quarters and fuck…
Got no love for broke bitches with no drough
I dropped out but I done fine
I know you heard about them stages I been murdering
Light my swisher up as they rolling my room service in
The shopping sprees, all this fly shit I’m purchasing
Tattoos on my face cause now I know I’ll never work again
The pretty bitches that know why they sell purposes
But still blame me for the emotions they be working with
And jealous niggas that was once..
The kush I’m blowing, inside the coop that I’m swerving

[Hook: Freeway]
We get that green, Charlie Sheen

All I know is get money don’t make no money
I’m strapped motherfucker you can’t take shit from me
We winning, we winning

All I know is get money don’t make no money
I’m strapped motherfucker you can’t take shit from me

[Verse 2: Blanco]
Yeah, I’m on the freeway, with the hundred pack
I’m Yeah, I’m on the freeway, with the hundred pack
I’m with Freeway, but I ain’t tell them that
I’ve been to hell and back
I ain’t a backpack rapper but I got a back pack full of hammer straps
…cliche, what the streets say
The streets said they want the raw
So DJ, we play with them K’s like it's laser tag
And anyone in my way is gonna pay for that
I’m in the bay like a motherfucker raider’s hat
I run the bay, what you faggots gotta say to that?
You say the fakest raps, and all I say it’s fact
It’s over bitch, Fade to black

[Hook]
We get that green, Charlie Sheen

All I know is get money don’t make no money
I’m strapped motherfucker you can’t take shit from me

[Verse 3: Lil Rue]
Las Vegas nights, I’m at the crap tables
