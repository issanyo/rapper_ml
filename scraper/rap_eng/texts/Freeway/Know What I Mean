[Verse 1 - Freeway]
(You know what I mean)
I'm on my hood shit, nigga that bullshit
A full clip on my hip, ready to pull shit
I'll blam ya, I'm the +MC+ with the +Hammer+ that is +Too Legit To Quit+
(You know what I mean)
I said I'm on my block shit, totin that Glock shit (uh huh)
Sellin them drugs, baggin up them rocks for a profit (uh huh)
Show me some love, nigga come up here with that nonsense
Fill 'em with slugs (buck, buck)
(You know what I mean)
I'm 'bout to break it down little niggas, what it do little niggas
I see myself when I look at you little niggas (that's right)
I came to school who? School you little niggas (pay attention)
Pay attention cause I'm about to drop some jewels on you niggas
Only move with niggas that don't get moved on
Don't get cool with niggas that get they scheme on
They'll leave you somewhere steamin with all your jewels gone
(You know what I mean)
I made it out but I'm in so I'm promotin the hood
I'm about to break down a few do's and don'ts in the hood
You gotta stack your dough, stay on your toes in the hood
(You know what I mean)
If you motherfuckers tryin stack riches in the hood
You gotta maintain your business, watch the snitches in the hood
If they snitchin wipe the snitches and the witness out the hood (woo!)
(You know what I mean)
Wipe 'em down
Find a innocent chick in the hood, pipe her down
You startin to like her so I think you need to wife her now (that's
Right)
Put everything in her name cause her credit good
Like houses and vehicles, you survivin now
You makin cash and you can pass off weight
But gotta be prepared to blast and be prepared for the hate
Cause them bitch niggas'll kill you and then be there for your wake
(You know what I mean)
Bastards, carryin your casket
Gotta keep your friends and keep your relatives straight
Cause them same niggas'll bend you, get you sent upstate (uh huh)
Keep them bitches out your business
They'll set you up with the quickness
(You know what I mean)
I'm a witness
This nigga Hass ran a lottery joint
This chick slow ride 'em, blow dried 'em, had him right off point
Put him to sleep then she kindly brought the robbery to him (damn!)
(You know what I mean)
Watch your back in the hood, cause hate come from all angles
And be weary of niggas and bitches, they on angles
Make sure you tote your banger, never sell dope to strangers
Be courteous to your neighbors
I am Swayze, later
