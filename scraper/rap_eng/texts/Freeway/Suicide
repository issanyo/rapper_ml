[Hook]
This is suicide, this is suicide
Fucking with my crew and I, this is suicide
This is suicide, this is suicide
Fucking with my crew and I, this is suicide
This is suicide, came here to blow
I'm talking three scores and four years ago
Prepare the flow, nigga
This is suicide, came here to blow
I'm talking three scores and four years ago
Prepare the flow

[Verse 1]
This is suicide, what you goin' do about it?
I bet your crew would die, leave your mom teary
[?]
Rappers come to Philly, we would yap you if your jewelry shine
Pray to get your jewelry back, then you would get your jewelry [?]
When I buck him, I'm out, I ain't fucking with the judge
And I ain't fucking up your jury time
Just like N.O.R.E., I'm on the run, eating
Better dart when I pull it, these bullets heat seeking
I got what it takes to rock the mic right
And I also got what it takes to make you meet the reaper, bitch
I got the flavor and it's banging through your speakers
But I still get the heater, shoot a nigga out the bleachers
You should let me teach you, when y'all goin' learn
If we bring out them burners, you'll be bringing out the preacher

[Hook]

[Bridge] x2
Suicide, it's a suicide
Biddy, bye bye
Suicide, it's a suicide

[Verse 2]
I want 'em all dead, kill 'em all dead
I don't care if your bald-headed or [?] dread
Don't feel the love, came to show you we not happy here
Don't try me still put the bullet in your nappy head
Yeah, if I'm somewhere with a strappy neck [?]
Calm [?] on you, put the pause on you, just like Strappy said
But if a strap run up on me, you'll get clapped
I will kill a nigga, capped, even though I got a rap career
And before that I had a pot career, coke in the water
In the pot in there, it's hot in there
I seen smokers rot in there, cops came, and we hid in there
Then they contemplated, then they raided, we were not in there
New niggas trying to come around since we made it
Where were you when we were incarcerated, you were not in there
Rocks in our gear, Roca wear before [?]
We don't feel ya, you should go and kill yourself [?]

[Hook]
