[Intro - Freeway - talking]
Ha, we in here, these are the moments, uh

[Hook - Freeway] (LaToiya Williams)
I'm in love with the music, got it in for the groove
And it comes out when I go into the booth
And Jake's so selfish always freakin the beat
He make it slap when he be freakin the loop
LaToiya co-sign it, then she, slow ride it
Cause she, so gifted, make the beat come, heat come, yeah
(Ooh, ooh, freakin you) (freakin you)
(It's all I wanna do, it's you, baby)

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
Every time I grab a new one, try to have her to myself
But if she hot enough, I guess I gotta give my crew some (uh)
Gotta share it with Mac and the Young Gunz (that's right)
Sparks and O, share it with Hov'
Share it with Crakk, then she holla out that
The way y'all freak me, other dudes can't hold a candle to that (woo)
Yeah, you gotta another track, I'll handle that (handle that)
Flow drip all over her like candle wax (candle wax)
Grab his and hers furs, kept the track warm (track warm)
Jake fill it with the bass, keep the track fat (yeah)
Matter of fact I am everywhere the track at (uh)
Dress her with them sick raps, keep the track laced, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I swear to God I love you, it don't get no better than you (uh)
But you know what, my girl so jealous of you (that's right)
She say we take so much time to freak (time to freak)
But when we finish, she be happy when we eat (happy when we eat)
All the spendin, all the weekends on the beach (on the beach)
But when I'm finished, I'm right back to the beats (fo' sho'!)
Yeah (uh), Freezer make the beat blow, go to sleep
Wake up, then jump back on the beat for more (that's right)
I used to jump up on the beat for free
Now I'm eatin, I be sleepin with the beats for dough
I ain't selfish with the sexin, other beats can come
I swear, right after I freak 'em, the beats could go, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
I take beats (take beats), Freezer rape beats (rape beats)
Fuck beat boxes, even fuck break beats (fuck break beats)
I used to be in love with Just Blaze beats (love with Just Blaze beats)
And I still want her (still want her), put the dillz on her (dillz on her)
They say "she too hot," I put the chill on her (chill on her)
Spit them bars, keep it real on her, yeah
