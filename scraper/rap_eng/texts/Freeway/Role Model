[Verse 1]
All I do is drop facts, spit raps, murder tracks for eons
Leave these rappers with no shoulders to lean on
Gun packin', yes I'm definitely strappin' the heat on
Anybody try to attack me, clappin' the heat off
Leave y'all bleedin' on the sidewalk since y'all wanna perform try rappin' in the ER
F-R-E-E like GE bring good things to life, no CPR
All around the world like Bowing, everywhere we go people know that we stars
Big bear like your grandpa, and I lay them the law like your grandpa, and I
Often kick it with your grandma, she my cougar, she awake me like a rooster, make my man rise
She make them cheese, eggs, butter, grits on fries
And she my fan she always listen to my old rhymes
She on her Juve shit, you fuckin' with them hoes, huh
You like 'em young, huh, you both sick of me, huh
I told her "No it ain't personal I'm just chasin' the guwap"
'Round the clock like hickory-dickory-dock
However rappin' or rippin' the block
I'll see y'all when I make it to the top

[Hook]
I spit that abstract rap y'all need
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like Free
Yeah, I body beats and I body MCs
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like Free

[Verse 2]
Y'all need to grow up, hold up it's a hold up
Put your hands up, I'm robbin' everybody till I blow up
Then I might slow up, give resist, I cock and pop 'em if the nigga check out somewhat
Freezer's reckless, so what
Get your neck slit, back blown, any people try to get me clapped, no luck
R Easy, rolled up
Put it in the air, we gon' lay 'em on the ground as soon as we roll up
Just because they owe us, them niggas gun food, them niggas lunch meat, cold cuts
Let the heater roast 'em like generators
You know fuckin' with Free'll get your generals off
Don't you know I'm King Kong, get your villagers stomped
Philly Freezer show them haters no love

[Hook]
I spit that abstract rap y'all need
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like Free
Yeah, I body beats and I body MCs
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like Free
