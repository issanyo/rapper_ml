[Verse 1: Freeway]

I tried to school em, tell em don't let niggas fool em
Cause when the pistol go, the one who's murdered be them other niggas (yup)
You know we gain them figgas, me and Jacka
We raising the stature unload them clappas so bring them surgeons with ya
We worldwide, we never heard you niggas
Don't try me, flow like tsunami and mass murder niggas
Free'll ruin his prize, slide through and
Hockey smack 'em like a hockey puck, I Jeremy Roenick niggas
Me and Jack are the new appointed councils of rap
Move ounces of crack, move rhymes, flow like oceans and rivers
It's the Roc, Mob Figaz we sure to deliver
We hustling and living while y'all just coast in the back
Let me take y'all niggas back, prior to rap
I fired the gat on jokers sold coke for a living
Sold dope for a living, sold raw for a living
Now we all offer salah, hope Allah will forgive us, nigga...

[Hook:]
They don't know how can they understand (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2: The Jacka]

Ice cold with my nigga Freeza in the Triton lobby,
Seen beans and Adisa, we was building on Islam
Just a villain from the slums tryna come up with these drugs
They say still we got so far to go cause that's not how it was
I got hooked up with a lot of coke, did it all for us
Gangsta from the MOB, but, in Allah we trust
I tried to purify my heart cause I'm a slave to my thoughts
I'm a monster out here, cause I change when it's dark
Still got the sound gear, comb the hood with my Glock
Searching for niggas who purchased, fiending strictly for they guap
Niggas chilling on the spot like the world is theirs
But they give yo ass a lot when the barrel to they head
I be in my Porsche smoking, eyes redder than red
These suckas acting like they hard gon' end up deader than dead
Don't let yo shorty make his forty knock yo brain out ya dreads
We out here getting rich for real, you niggas praying for bread, nigga...

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Make Salat, praise Allah cause knowledge is power
If you disrespect Islam, then The fullies will shower
Nigga just relax your mind And listen to ???
Stay caught in the Dunya Were the ??? the ???
To the mayne, changed my name to Shaheed cause I'm a
Muslim indeed, all I had to do is read
Yes Qu'ran can lead you through the grief, humble the beef
Make you sharper than the hardest niggas hustling ?
Raw Biz like Free, so we don't look like the Pagans
Free the nigga Hus, we got our game from prophets in heaven
