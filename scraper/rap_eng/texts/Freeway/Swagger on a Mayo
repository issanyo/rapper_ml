[Intro: Freeway]
Man I'm just tryna live my life
Man I'm just tryna get this money
Man I'm just tryna rock my ice
Man I'm just tryna hit these honeys
Live luxury, let me be more precise

[Verse 1: Freeway]
Right, I'm a North Philly block nigga
Serve china white, I'm not a pot dealer
It's the best beard in the rap game
Man I swear to God it's not a guy iller
This a BM, it's not a Acura
Illmatic like Nas, a nigga popular
My nigga brought three or foru hitters
If you get outta line, them hitters they'll pop at you
It's official, we want you, we'll get you
You came here scar-free, leave here in stitches
Strolled in the party, leave out limpin'
Y'all wanna argue, we want women
Y'all niggas borrowin', always spendin'
I'm like the bank 'cause I'm always lendin'
Always repentin' 'cause I'm always sinnin'
Keep a Louis bag 'cause I'm always in it
I like the Jag so I'm always in it
We eat good so I'm always tippin'
Tippin', tippin', them niggas set trippin'
The extended clip will send me handspring flippin'
Flip him, flip him, flip him, flip him, flip him, flip him

[Chorus: Freeway & Lil Uzi Vert]
Swagger on a mayo
European whip and they know
Swagger on a mayo
Every day I get the mayo
Late night stop, hitters on the payroll
I suggest y'all niggas lay low
How low? way low, swagger on a mayo
Swagger on a mayo
Swagger on a mayo
Blue face in the bankroll
She wanna roll with a star
Now she doin' what I say so
Swagger on a mayo
Just swagger on a mayo
Just swagger on a mayo
Swagger on a mayo
Just swagger on a mayo
Just swagger on a mayo

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Swagger on a mayo, in that miracle whip
It's gonna take a miracle if you get hit
What's on my hip, diamonds bigger than a tick
That's on my wrist
And speaking of that rollie, man that bitch don't tick
Lil Uzi so sick, and Free don't miss
I took his new bitch and kept my old bitch
And that's what you get for being broke, bitch
I'm on my GOAT shit
Matter of fact, scratch that out, need a new lotus
Counting all this money, hands itch
Got a little bitch named Ashley
Pussy so wet like Hurricane Sandy
Perky tan nigga and the xanny
Crush it in the lean like it's candy
Perky tan nigga and the xanny
Crush it in the lean like it's candy, candy, candy, candy, candy

[Chorus: Freeway & Lil Uzi Vert]
Swagger on a mayo
European whip and they know
Swagger on a mayo
Every day I get the mayo
Late night stop, hitters on the payroll
I suggest y'all niggas lay low
How low? way low, swagger on a mayo
Swagger on a mayo
Swagger on a mayo
Blue face in the bankroll
She wanna roll with a star
Now she doin' what I say so
Swagger on a mayo
Just swagger on a mayo
Just swagger on a mayo
Swagger on a mayo
Just swagger on a mayo
Just swagger on a mayo
