(It ain't easy but I try)
Every day is a constant battle
(Oh to do right)
To progress as a man
(Or to fight)
Statik Selektah
Uh, listen

Ayo it's hard not to kill niggas
Just like a full-time job not to peel triggers
Bag up and move raw, tryin' to build figures
But I learned when it's hard you get a little bigger, the Lord is still with ya
Real spit so often I will get turned up
You're saucy and then you're corrupt
Just often and then return
I get this feeling up inside, it torture me and it burn up
I'm scorchin, it's like a furnace
It force me to get the burner but
I'm older and I'm smarter so I just turn a cheek
To the bullshit, knocked it off, I became a learner
If it ain't 'bout moving forward it don't concern us
But if you need lyrics galore then I'm at your service
Man, I thought I lived the life real 'cause I like still
Kept the ice grill to see who face was meaner
But nowadays this negative energy could be so contagious
I gotta keep some space between us
Positive energy like a boomerang
I send it out, put it in God's hands and let him do a stand
No more tryin to stress bricks to impress chicks
'Cause I just keep you in a box like some fresh kicks
I'm tryin' to be amongst the illest of rhymers
I'm no longer the kid who was fillin' them 9's up
Wait, I gotta go and cop the steel and remind yous
Nah, I just kill em with kindness, spread love not war

Love war
This is love
Hell no, this is war

It's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full-time job not to kill niggas
'Cause I'm a real nigga
I'm from where they leave bodies and pose the blood
Riddled with bullets like the hospital view niggas
No feel, nigga
Down the street from Richard
I only had a couple hundred thousand a night before the deal nigga
From the ville, nigga
A house niggas, you a house nigga, I'm a field nigga
Always talk dramatic but I put down the ratchet and I
Got with Statik to build, nigga
Wise men build and destroy to build buildings
Crash a plane in your time will force a new beginning
And I hope you be in it
Have you on the nigga news, UPN and Channel 6 Action News
Then I break Seagal off the Compton cruise
Snatch my boy out and tell the warden good afternoon
I was told by one of the greatest that you got the best caine
Can't another flow after you
Do what you can do like you can do
Them boys hate to boof you flame the roof
Parts untenable, flows untenable
Ya'll niggas can't kill me, your gun's unaimable
And love so long so bring the watcher
I done sent the angel of death
Then snatch my soul, ya'll can't clap the board
I keep cash, 'case cops arrest me
'Case kids kidnap me, kids can get at me
And then keep straps on when them kids bring me back
They trap 'em and then they clap 'em
Dirtnap 'em and I still show 'em compassion
Order 'em caskets
Tutor their bastards, take 'em to classes
Get them they masters, then send them to Statik
Let's go
