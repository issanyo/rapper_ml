Every way chain but the flow us, make account swollen up
You say you don't know us
Bitch grow up, you say you drink Rose moe, bitch pour up
Swallow back don't throw up, get toe up
Shake car so up, yes we ball every day make more us
Man I respect like dime P more butch
You freaky you can get a trip to south beach on us
New sneaks on us, new drugs that's all
Always got them bottles on that no last car
Is for sure fun, make your more come
Long as they swallow

Hook:
Bearded wonder in the motherf*cking building
Swag on the hundred thousand trillion
Hater matter that with another one
If I ain't got my..then you know I got my other gun
I am fresh 'cause I've been fresh and I am fly
'cause I've been fly, and my bear big and my bins white
And your girl gettin in swallow
Twitter us she follows, see on my INstaGram photos hit light
Streaming they consider us models
Girls you're just as tripping as dice
Stripping off diggers that we're living that life
Sleeping with niggas that's we're flipping that white
Now I make the pussy willie like I'm living that bike
And I never give her nothing 'cause my flipping that tight
She call me I turn up, 'cause I beat her up
She call em I turn her just because I beat it up
And every time I beat it up she want me to eat it up
My Twitter shut up, bitch swallow
Her neck go back just like a throw back
But there ain't nothing new to you, you already know that
Spit sick bar so she all on my bones
And round me she happy real yeah she need Rose
Why you so mad, pow pow hold that
Kill you in the morning 'cause my team moment
Wait kids screaming free wave flow so red
That's the main reason he's rappers trying to clone that
Whip the microphone and I might have called you done that
Mike.. and Mike Tyson, Michel Jack saw that
And now the girls gonna follow
Ending swallow
