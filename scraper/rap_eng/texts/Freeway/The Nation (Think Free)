[Chorus: Jadakiss]
There's no way that you can handle this
I'm a gorilla, I spit banana clips
Leave you stiff like a mannequin
Join the nation now I'm the man again
To my surprise, we are done with the pause
No, we won't go back to that again
There's no way that you can handle this
I'm a gorilla my kush bananas, yes

[Verse 1: Freeway]
Y'all can't handle 'em
I been handling it
2000 i was in the in Miami in the Mandolin
Oriental with an oriental on the 3rd room
Same floor just not coincidental
Black card for my incidentals, swipe
Yeah, I see you in the Lambo
But it's a rental
You on some flee shit
I'm on some G shit
Bitch nigga don't make me free mix your instrumental
Be cool and I might let you live a little
Call your girl Monie, because she always let me in the middle
Take it back I'm with Lukie, Roman, Graziano
Taking keys you would think that we would play piano
Graduated to the grand piano
I be tired, don't make me come back to take your man piano
Snatching dishes but some dishes got broke
These niggas pussy like some bitches I know eh, eh

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
There is no way that you can handle this
I'm a gorilla I spit banana clips
Leave you stiff like a mannequin
Join the nation now I'm the man again
To my surprise, we are done with the pause
No, we won't go back to that again
There's no way that you can handle this
I'm a gorilla my kush bananas, yes

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
We smoke good weed and sip cognac
Ride around is the squad the old Pontiacs
Tryna' locate P yo' where Donnie at?
I was kinda hoping that he would bring Bronnie back
Violate me I bring the Tommie back
You only get one life, you should honor that
I'm coming home with a profit
You bringing drama back
You won't be able to get your momma back
Nah, just how I'm feeling
Can't say I won't go back, for now, I'm chilling
As long as our presence is felt we up in the building
I got a crib with a room, money up to the ceiling, yeah
There's no way that you can deal with me, no way
Niggas that came with me, still with me (right here)
Niggas that been rich, is still filth
Til I prove my innocence. I'm still guilty, what

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
There is no way you can handle this
I'm a gorilla I spit banana clips
Leave you stiff like a mannequin
Join the nation now I'm the man again
To my surprise, we are done with the pause
No, we won't go back to that again
There's no way that you can handle this
I'm a gorilla my kush bananas, yes
