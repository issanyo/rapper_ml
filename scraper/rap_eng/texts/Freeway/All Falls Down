[Chorus]
What you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
When it all falls down
And ain't nobody to pick you up
And ain't nobody there to comfort you
What you gon' do?
I know what you're goin' through
I was there when it all fell down
It was nobody there pick me up
It was nobody to comfort me






[Post-Chorus]
My akhi told me don't forget that God with you
My momma told me don't forget that God with you
[?] Mohammed told me I see God in you
So don't forget that God with you, God bless you

[Verse 1]
We survivors, I say we survivors
We was almost there that's why we latest
Always find a way it's like you MacGyver
Point me to the pain, point me to the pain
Y'all say y'all love me don't believe you niggas
'Cause when my kidneys failed I ain't see you niggas
Now that is me on a big screen, everybody like I know Free he my nigga
Uzi my real dawg, free my nigga
Who showed up, he my nigga
Found out that half of my dawgs are there when I'm up not there when it all falls

[Chorus]
What you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
When it all falls down
And ain't nobody to pick you up
And ain't nobody there to comfort you
What you gon' do?
I know what you're goin' through
I was there when it all fell down
It was nobody there pick me up
It was nobody to comfort me

[Post-Chorus]
My akhi told me don't forget that God with you
My momma told me don't forget that God with you
[?] Mohammed told me I see God in you
So don't forget that God with you, God bless you

[Verse 2]
You was the man 'til your plan fool you
Now you sittin' in a can 'cause your man ain't loyal
He's sittin' on a stand with his hand on the Bible
Confessing to the jury how you whipped it to O's to the jury how you [?]
Prison sentence no more, tuition for your daughter
Your chicks crossed the border
Her phones out of order
You brought bed bugs home got your baby caught upr daughter gettin' older and figure they call her gorgeous
You always taught her moral but not there to enforce it
This is the life we chose the raw [?]
We knew it wasn't safe when we laced tha Air Forces
Tried to call your chick but she [?] like the [?]
There when you up, not there when it all falls

[Chorus]
What you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
When it all falls down
And ain't nobody to pick you up
And ain't nobody there to comfort you
What you gon' do?
I know what you're goin' through
I was there when it all fell down
It was nobody there pick me up
It was nobody to comfort me

[Post-Chorus]
My akhi told me don't forget that God with you
My momma told me don't forget that God with you
[?] Mohammed told me I see God in you
So don't forget that God with you, God bless you

[Verse 3]
Your lifestyle'll make a grown man holla
Workin' three jobs, two kids, no baby father
No whip checks so your next check gotta
Go to the food and the baby products
You brought bed bugs home got your baby caughter
Days like these it feels like they stormin' on us
Eatin', cold pizza had to warm it on up', cold pice I had to warm it on up
Parents ain't doin' no better so they callin' on us
This is life and this rough one, we aim for the gusto
But end up in the ghetto with scuffed shoes and used clothes up
Blame Uncle Sam, no way it is our fault
There when you up, not there when it all falls

[Chorus]
What you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
When it all falls down
And ain't nobody to pick you up
And ain't nobody there to comfort you
What you gon' do?
I know what you're goin' through
I was there when it all fell down
It was nobody there pick me up
It was nobody to comfort me

[Post-Chorus]
My akhi told me don't forget that God with you
My momma told me don't forget that God with you
[?] Mohammed told me I see God in you
So don't forget that God with you, God bless you
