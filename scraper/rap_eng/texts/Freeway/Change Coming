I feel a change coming on bussing through my veins
Won't be long till I'm gone and they all know my name
I feel a change coming on bussing through my veins
Won't be long till I'm gone and they all know my name

Verse one [Chill Moody]
Hold up hold up, ya'll feel that?
It's the feeling Chill bout to bring the real back
Ain't gotta peel caps to kill tracks, shuffle and deal that
(got this drank in my cup) I never spill that
Ya'll even still rap? I hear a bunch of nonsense
Won't take it back to them bars like ex-convicts
It's common sense to throw my name next to Common Sense ,eventually
I'm convinced ya'll all on some pajama $#!^
Sleeping on me that's the cousin of unconsciousness
They pompousness got them blind to my accomplishments
Tell them get on my level a lyrical rebel
Called him underground, well I'm prepared with a shovel
And a flow to glance twice at, something like a nice rack
Navigate the 36 chambers with a spiked bat. Blaaw
They stuck sitting there hurt, i lit my loosey off the flame from them bridges I burnt. i feel a change

Verse two [Chill Moody]
Ya'll making movies now you dudes is clowns
To claim my spot I sho'nuff will shut your movie down
Stomp on your boom box, thinking your crews hot
Nah, you high as Manute's tube socks ock
Said the groove won't stop, till my crews on top
Here to clean the game up, I was Pujols spot
You can line them up, grinding till my time is up
Milwaukee to Tampa I'm chasing all kind of Bucks
Wasn't fond of us, now they loving it
Can't water the fire you gotta smother it
Leeroy with this glow that I'm covered in
Dough coming in, I go off like Dave Sullivan
It's just different where I take them with mine
You and your homie, phony rollies, big waste of my time
Dark knights happy days I relate to the Fonz
But keep it cool as Bobby Drake on the prom, thats nice things

Hook
I feel a change coming on bussing through my veins
Won't be long till I'm gone and they all know my name
I feel a change coming on bussing through my veins
Won't be long till I'm gone and they all know my name

Verse three [Freeway]
It's time for change, Like Obama said
People hurting outside they need Obama Care
Used to post up on the corner with the llamas
Now I post up on the island, flew your sister and your momma there
Bearded wonder locked rap ten summers
Going on my eleventh one now you can tell that I'm a winner
Kept the same game face, kept it real from the beginning
So your sister let me hit it, lay pipe like a plummer, yeah
Same city as WIll Smith and Meek Mill
Same city as Jill Scott and she's pretty
Same city as B.Sig and Gillie
B*&%$ I'm talking bout' Philly
Here's the future time to meet Chill
He rep the West side, thats right lets ride
Where n&@^# quick to put you on your backside, so you
Best be on your best behavior, or they'll
Run up and tag you with the laser, get fried
Like a cheesesteak, I'm making cheesecake
If I wasn't I would run up on you take your cheese plate
I was broke, now I see them chips
Make sure they know my name before I leave this B&&@%^
