[Hook - Freeway]
While others spit that Wonderama shit
Me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous
Caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
And fuck with cream, y'all know
Exactly what I'm talking about
Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous
Caught up in the finest shit
We winning like the Lakers, pulling them capers
Getting them anchors, we
Hustle for the paper? Naw
Hustle for the grind of it

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
All-Louis Lexus, fresh Nik Airs on
My Blackberry molasses, BBM messages from actresses
Federales wanna stick me with charges for trafficking
For the simple fact that when he rap, rap heron
Flame war, when I'm in the booth, turn the air on
Middle of the Winter, give you ? of Summer
It's a jungle outside, a jungle full of haters
Everyday it makes me want to wonder
How I keep from going under
Cold like the tundra, great like the old bear
But I want grind more than I want slumber
The cooker of the pie, been facing the stove
Down to supply, here to supply y'all hunger

While others spit that Wonderama shit

Shall remain anonymous
Caught up in the finest shit
We winning like the Lakers, pulling them capers
Getting them anchors, we
Hustle for the paper, naw
Hustle for the grind of it

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I do it just to do it
We do it for the paper
We're in it for the income
We came her for the cake-a
Please inform your bosses that we're
Invading your offices
Gonna be some lay-offs, some of y'all
Gonna take a pay cut
Military style: either ship out or shape up
We ?
Start my day off early
But I don't forget my prayers
Do it 5 times, gully, paying homage to the maker
Never been a faker, always been a flamer
Been hot since I used to write my raps on paper
Now the roof is the canvas
And my mind is the ink
The engineer is the key: he record it, I say it

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
I'm equivalent to cocaine: Bolivian, Dominican
Flew over on planes, snuck over here by immigrants
When I'm finished with this music shit
You can probably catch me in Mecca or
The United Arab Emirates
Don't take mini-vacations but I am a trip
Young black Muslim, Big Bear, I hemmorrage
Bomb threat, these are bomb sets, get your set bombed
First I show up with the Tech-9, see how real he get
I'm like a young Genghis Khan with the rhymes
Warrior with a mindframe to conquer small villages
Word to Yung Chris: I am on my Philly shit
Couple burners, couple clips
You know how Philly get..
