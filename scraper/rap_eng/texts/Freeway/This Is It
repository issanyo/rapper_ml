[Hook]
Make no mistake where you are, this is it
Your back's in to the corner, this is it
Don't be a fool anymore
The waiting is over
I can't slip nigga, this is it nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm up early fit my bindess, my suit and tie on
Real provide, spit it you can rely on
Same niggas take it to niggas that get they high on
Thicker man clean up the dishes after the python
No, I can't let pythons be bygones
Still representing for my street
And my music came up in... influenced by fire arms
You looking for that fire song, this is it
From the north side of philly but the west side brace me
When the rest got lazy, all I did was keep it movin
All I did was build a movement, find a way to get the pay
To get the pampers for the babies, how I do it, this is it
Flow like fluid, used to have the...
Strip the car like otis, showed up in the newest
All I did stay focused, when the shit seemed hopeless
Mama died told son you gotta do it!

[Hook]
Make no mistake where you are, this is it
Your back's in to the corner, this is it
I am living life with no regrets
Don't be a fool anymore
I reply with violence so hold your threats
The waiting is over
I can't slip nigga, this is it nigga

[Verse 2]
You don't get too many chances
If I can recall, you get a few graduations
Like 2 prom dances, goal of the nation is to get an education
After college people wind up with Nathan
What they took was all... from all the time wasted
And they started hell raising
Time participation, a few whites, a few blacks
On a hunt for the paper
Know if you got no 40 acres
For the letter to beam, so please believe it
I'm a hold your kids down, as long as I'm breathing
I know they need they dad, so said you had to leave em
It was written by a law all, happens for a reason
Hope you spend your time reading, hope you spend your time deeming
Don't spend your time grieving, while you sit for...
I am give you 9 reasons, and still poke out your chest
I pulled your test with no regrets

[Hook]
Make no mistake where you are, this is it
Your back's in to the corner, this is it
I am living life with no regrets
Don't be a fool anymore
I reply with violence so hold your threats
The waiting is over
I can't slip nigga, this is it nigga

Make no mistake where you are, this is it
Your back's in to the corner
Don't be a fool anymore
The waiting is over, this is it

Make no mistake where you are, this is it
Your back's in to the corner
Don't be a fool anymore
The waiting is over, this is it
