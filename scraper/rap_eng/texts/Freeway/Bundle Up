[Verse 1: Nino Man]
I still hustle til' the sun come up
I'm from Harlem so my ones still up, it's a cold winter
I'm selling dope, getting bundles off
Same block we got money, we had rumbles off
Back then, they used to wish me well
But they ain't know I used to wish as well
I was stealing quarters out the wishing well
It was real back then, I was a different male
Bitches wouldn't fuck me cuz I used to kiss and tell
You damn right  I did it my nigga
Use to call the homies like "Yo, I hit it my nigga"
I'm Nino Man, you know these hoes be winning my nigga
She wanna count money but no, I shouldn't my nigga
I was making money off the block like (?)
Always kept a burner in the building where the mail be
Mail man asked where I get it, he like "tell me"
I'm like "nigga, please, just tell me when I get mail, B"
If you from the streets, real niggas heard you
Came from the sewer like a Ninja Turtle
Ya'll know Nino Man always speak the realist
But I'ma let the big bro, Freeway kill this

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Ex drug dealers, from Bandles to Villas
They seen a pick, they wonder what the deal is
They said I need a grip, they said "it's no sweat
You bomb Funk Flex and stay next to them 5 peelers"
Check my credentials, 100 million later, joint venture the same
Label was Al-Qaeda
From the benches to world stardom, my crew made it
No, we can't go cuz we so soulful like Miles Davis
Down the way, I sold rocks to my neighbors
Now, I'ma rockstar, repped the ROC on stages
Had to switch up the cadence to stack up my wages
It's a given, need that college tuition for the babies
On a daily, had 3 wings, fried rice and gravy
Used to push squadders, now we ride Mercedes
Used to rhyme for free but now, ya'll gotta pay me
Boy, I'm straight stuntin'; Kayslay me
Haters wanna lay me, mad cuz the radio play me
These people wanna DOA me
That's why I keep the jammy everywhere I go
Coming for them grammy's like my nigga from Chicago
It's your chance, better go hard as I go
Nice with the hands, hit ya'll niggas wit a combo
Still knocking niggas off their high horse; Tonto
I'm Roc Nation's muscle, head honcho
We vacate at Brussels; eat Waffles
We law low in the Bay cuz we Mobsters, nigga
