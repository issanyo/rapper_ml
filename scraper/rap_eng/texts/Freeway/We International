[Hook]
4-5-4 we international
Free way know, we all about the dough
Hustle every day, thats all I really know
Streets on lock, give them what they ask for
(2x)

[Verse 1: Drew Deezy]
454 and I ain't talking bout a chevy
Out of left field and you fakes ain't ready
2 months in and the name so heavy
No albums out, we already got feiddy
Your girl wear coach, my grl wear fendi
Say what you want cuz you still talkin pennies
I pop gold bottles and you still buying Remy
You say theres a drought, but we still got plenty
I know what it do cuz I been thru prison
454 chain got your girl attention
50 thou wow tucked in my true religions
Money stacked high that its blocking my vision
We add, we multiply, then we do division
200 on a lawyer, bet I bet the system
From Cali to Philly, we dont do no snitchin'
As real as it gets, all you have to do is listen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Free appear in a Bent, disappear in a breeze
Flow cocky, wrist zero degrees
With some model chicks so thick you can compare them to eve
But they gona listen. leave them apples and pears on the trees
You think about dissin us, they told you can touch us
Thats an error, we aiir, we dare ya to breathe
It might be in ur best interest to go
Matter fact if you move another inch ima sqeeze
454 is in the building with free
We get dough plenty of cheese
Repp for the vietnamese
This is free money, say it with me
Free money playing for keeps
Make ladies stay on their knees
Model bitches always stay on the scene
Cuz when im done they know im trying to put thang in them jeans
Freezer talk reckless on them records dont I, so y won't I..
Tell them haters DUU MAAAA.

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Thai]
Im too raw for the hataz
Maybe thats y they hate us
Out to get paper
Born to be the greatest
Rollin with the hustlas
Now pack it up and sell it
Ridin with the gangstas and everyone of them felons
We world wide
Down in the slums up in the hills
One thing we all feel
Is the mighty dollar bill
Ima be real
We the truth in the streets
So believe wat I say
Cuz its the truth when I speak

[Verse 4: IZ]
Money motivated
Streets dedicated
Grind like a tweekers teeth
Thats how I made it
Harder then an arubics cube
But ain't no square dudes here
Tight circle a mad one tad blunt illest
Cap peelers and hoes feelin this
Toast til ya host the most, ha, ya feelin it
2 striker, still livin that life
Mo money, mo problems
Mo cases then sampsonite
454!
