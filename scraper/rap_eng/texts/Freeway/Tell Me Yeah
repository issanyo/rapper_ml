[Verse 1: Freeway]
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
Nah mean? It's the situation that I be lacin'
Mics through this for recreation, you in the studio pacin'
Need to ask yourself a question
Is you working or you wastin' time?
I take my time and make a rhyme
Then make a dime and vacay in St.Tropez
Now I want you making time
Real talk, me and homie girl talk, we can bond
And we thinkin' way beyond makin' them hits
Man, we do this for the culture
Married to the game, I made my mixtape at the altar
Now that I got the fame you'll need a 16, that'll cost ya
Don't you try to play me, got a sick team that'll off ya
Don't make it, make it rain, don't want that rain, just keep it sunny
Know how we doin', ain't nothing movin' but the money
Had to grind hard just to get it
Listen, if you ain't kin then you ain't getting nothin' from me

[Hook: Freeway]
Do you love what I be cookin' up? Then holla, "yeah, yeah"
The block gon' tell me, know they tell me, "yeah"
Pretty ladies, are we hookin' up? Then holla, "yeah, yeah"
All the girls gon' tell me, know they tell me, "yeah"

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
To kill a pet, [?] backwoods
Damn, I love it when them boogie bitches act hood
Standing on couches, tables full of bottles
Do it like the [?], YOLO, you know the motto
Models vvs' clean, Jordan number sixes
Step up and we  freshest, table full of bitches
State to state, city to city
Ask around, we did this before y'all witnessed the king
LeBron was a witness, we them niggas

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Jump out my business, give niggas the business
And I just came home from Venice, poking with some bitches
Overseas we drinkin', eatin', smokin', enjoyin' their tradition
This trick ass pokin', she potent and delicious
She know Freezy got the buzz and she don't wanna miss it
She know Freezy in a rush, so she don't wanna risk it
Was waitin' by the curb, said she heard we them niggas
Wanna love me like a wifey and fuck me like a mistress
I'm with the gunners, special, we on a mission
When we in ya city need three pieces of biscuits
She came with you, but she leavin' with me
Little mami, what you smokin', what you sippin'?
