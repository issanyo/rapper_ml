3 scoops, 4 scoops, I'm skipping dinner
3 scoops, 4 scoops, I'm skipping dinner
When I finish, I need more scoops
We sprinkle the ice cream, right after we get the ice cream
After that we dip the ice cream, after that we lick the ice cream
Up early, we get the pesos, team early, you picked the right team
Summer time, I picked the right theme
Jeezy, Gucci, we are so icy, got my Jordan kicks, I got my martins hat
I'm out fishing like pisces
Kidnap your wifey, show her a good time
We don't wanna die, we just bump and grind
And I give back your wifey
Haters don't like me, they wanna light me
Cause they will misguide me, I'm forced to do dirt like ice t
Quench my thirst like sprite she
Do the right thing like spike lee
When she comes around, we just do it like Nike
Freak her while you right there
Freak her when she home alone
She know I got that cedar cheese, she know I got that provolone
Drop top whip say hi to God
Your girlfriend know how to ride
I scoop her like she hug and dodge
I scoop her like she cold stone
Ice cream, drip, drip, double dip this ice cream
Ice cream, drip, drip, make you lick this ice cream
They screaming for ice cream, he screaming for ice cream
She screaming for ice cream, they all want this ice cream
Kick's clean, ice cream, eat your chick like ice cream
House clean, ride clean, scoop your chick like ice cream
Kick's clean, ice cream, eat your chick like ice cream
House clean, ride clean, scoop your chick like ice cream
Chanel slippers from the toes up
2 am when I road up, white Lamborghini with the doors up
And I'm ice cream paid I'm froze up
Got bitches jocking my style, for robbing bitches on trout
These hoes get mad and hostile, cause my fist stay clean, brush out
Diamonds all in my jewelry, your man talking bout what he'd do to me
But this campaign shit ain't new to me
Miss 32, you know who would be
He go cucu for my fruity pebbles
Ice cream, drip, drip, double dip this ice cream
Ice cream, drip, drip, make you lick this ice cream
They screaming for ice cream, he screaming for ice cream
She screaming for ice cream, they all want this ice cream
Kick's clean, ice cream, eat your chick like ice cream
House clean, ride clean, scoop your chick like ice cream
Kick's clean, ice cream, eat your chick like ice cream
House clean, ride clean, scoop your chick like ice cream
Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, that rocky road
Butter, pekin, I've been in love with that cookie dough
Rum, raisin, you drive me crazy, that butter on
And I'm bout to hit bask and robbers
Cause all them flavors what I'm craving
Y'all people know what I'm saying
Need that cream so what I'm paying
Ice cream girl used to turn me down
But I pull in the beam like what up now
Bet they get that butt up now, 2 twins, ice cream sandwich
Big girl, like 4 gallons, still you bet not turn her down
Ice cream, burn the town, y'all dudes just run in town
We roam around the town, in search of that new flavor
Yolo, you got one life, I need klondikes, I need live savers
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts, hey, hey
I got ice cream in my cup, I got ice cream in my cup
I got ice cream in my cup, and my cup full yep
I might pull up in the benz, I might pull up in the beemer
I might pull up in the truck, and your bitch scoop
Ice cream, drip, drip, double dip this ice cream
Ice cream, drip, drip, make you lick this ice cream
They screaming for ice cream, he screaming for ice cream
She screaming for ice cream, they all want this ice cream
Kick's clean, ice cream, eat your chick like ice cream
House clean, ride clean, scoop your chick like ice cream
Kick's clean, ice cream, eat your chick like ice cream
House clean, ride clean, scoop your chick like ice cream
