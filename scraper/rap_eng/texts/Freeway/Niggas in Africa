[Intro: Freeway]
This shit crazy
That's right, niggas getting carried away, man
They building a bunch of niggas with beards
They got the snapbacks on
But they ain't got the flow, though

[Hook]
My flow so sick, motherfuckers wanna clone me
My flow so sick, flow so sick, motherfuckers wanna clone me
My flow so sick, flow so sick, motherfuckers wanna clone me
My flow so sick, flow so sick, motherfuckers wanna clone me
That shit cray

[Verse 1]
My flow so sick, motherfuckers wanna clone it
Flow so ill, motherfuckers wanna own it
Tote that steel, motherfucker -- wanna hold it?
I'll unload it
You get folded like shirts and jeans
You must be high on pills and water, storts and lean
You can get on your knees and pray to the Lord
Still, you will never ever flow like Free, uh
I flow like the great ones
Matter of fact, I flow like it's eight floods
Matter of fact, I flow like Atlantic, Pacific
Sink Titanics, terrific
Shit gigantic, horrific
It's scary
You rarely can find a nigga that can flow like us
Or get dough like us
They don't reach their goals like us
They're washed up like soap and suds
My flow is magnificent, addictive like some potent bud
Jay and Ye, while they're in Paris, we're in Africa
Hit y'all niggas with the motherland flow
Racks on racks, I rubberband dough
Got more rubberbands when the rubberbands go
Still in the motherland with a motherland ho
When it comes to screwing, she know what she doing
I don't know what she saying, but I love her lingo
Tango, IPhone call from your daughter
At Harvard -- she always bless me with knowledge cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Who flow sicker?
Jay and Wayne? Well, who told Wayne that? Who told Jigga?
Who told Drake? Heir to the throne
Philly Freeway home, better give me my space
It's a different year, but ain't shit changed
If I can't serve you, still got stitches in place
Freeway ride like the Michelin Man
Leave rappers in the Michigan lake
I'm great, y'all late
Just trying to get by, Talib Kweli
Y'all trying to get high, I'm trying to get higher
Do this til y'all call me sire
Do this til y'all call me for shows
And the purse be like fifty or higher
Y'all know me, I'm a Philly O.G
Got songs with Jay, these songs Mariah
I'm no liar, I don't gotta
Never had a Bugatti but I hit the Borgata
A.C. shit, last weekend
I'm the captain cause my flow make em seasick
Flip raps, used to flip white
Still shine bright, got ice like a ski trip
And if I take my ice off
Shit'll get dark like a eclipse
Y'all better part like the Red Sea
Y'all better dip like some Herr's chips
On my Chris Columbus shit
Throw y'all off where the earth ends
I've been raw since my birth in
I've been sick since my first step
I'll be the best til my last breath
Make a new flow when the song ends

[Hook]
