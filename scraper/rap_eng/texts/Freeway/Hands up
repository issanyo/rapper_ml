[Chorus 1 - Freeway]
Now everybody throw your hands up, it's "The Stimulus Package"
Now throw your hands up, we givin back to the people
Now throw your hands up, if you rockin with Jake One and Philly Freezer
Everybody throw your hands up, it's "The Stimulus Package"
Now throw your hands up, we givin back to the people
So throw your hands up, if you rockin with Jake One and Philly Freezer

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
I'm talkin Gang Starr and Naughty, way before B.I.G. and 'Pac was discussed
I had my walkman in my pocket, used to hop on the bus
I used to rock it, used to knock until the mixtape popped
Tribe Called Quest and Black Sheep was knockin to us
Yeah, Leaders of the New, I'm from the old school
I'm about to bring y'all people new school, hip-hop you can trust
I'm from the Roc-A, yeah, your sisters hung my posters in they lockers
But I still got that knock that makes the people bop they head
I am alive, so the "Dynasty's" not dead
I have arrived, I came to snatch your spots so switch your locks up
Robin Hood, I steal from the rich, give to the poor
Represent for all my bulls that are shackled up and locked up
You know what's ill, prior to the deal
Was in the same boat as them but I made it out of my cuffs
So I will, deliver to the Phill'
Promise to keep it real, show skills, heat the mic up, yeah

[Chorus 2 - Freeway]
Throw your hands up, it's "The Stimulus Package"
Now throw your hands up, we givin back to the people
Now throw your hands up, if you rockin with Jake One and Philly Freezer
Everybody throw your hands up, it's "The Stimulus Package"
Now throw your hands up, we givin back to the people
So throw your hands up, if you rockin with Jake One and Philly Freezer

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
We bringin y'all Original Flavor, raised off De La
Kept Black Moon in my boombox player
Back in the day I used to steal that nigga Rakim's style

When I flowed and I didn't say "may I?"
Let's say I was 16 years old
Then I grew and learned how to cross over like A.I
Yup, stack paper, every since that day I
Made moves, listen to Wu with (Cash Rules)
Now my own entity, official Rhymesayer
Boss player, don't ask nobody for favors
Before I met Jay I been knew that the "Streets Watch"
It's Barack of the block, doin hip-hop a favor (what's that?)
Bringin that realness back, it's "The Stimulus Pack'"
All fake and false rappers can fall and collapse
Drop and die, them and I
Will not miss you, no ribbon in the sky, no!

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
I remember when I was first tryin to be a rapper guy
Like Pharcyde, the labels kept on (Passin' Me By)
Nowadays when I hit 'em with the flow again
They like "there he go again, the dopest Ethopian"
Nope, Afro-American, hit y'all with the realness, I don't hit y'all
With the babblin
Hit y'all with the songs, then I hit y'all with the battlin
Drug traffickin, drop "The Stimulus Package"
Watch these rappers follow my pattern, yeah!

[Chorus 2]

[Outro - Freeway - 2X]
Now everybody throw you hands up (hands up ...)
Now throw your hands up (hands up ...)
Throw your hands up (hands up ...)
Now throw your hands up (hands up ...)
