[Verse 1: Freeway]
Hit it
Young Philly from the block y'all rockstars
This is criminal opera I got y'all
60 niggas willin to pop y'all or rock y'all
Freezer cruise the city in a hot car sports car
In Cleveland today, Atlanta tomorrow
Free will never be soft cuz the hood is in me
They say it will be here today gone tomorrow
But I'm still standin strong cuz the hood is with me (hit me)
Yes! before this rap thing cracked off
I was somewhere gettin a pack off that's all
Now I'm gettin my raps off that's all
Shuttin down colliseums like Nassau asshole (Freezy where you been)
I took four years off
I went to Mecca paid respect and
Earned some checks for the road
Be the man that cut the check so please respect Young Hov
Before I hit y'all with the tech
And turn ya lights down low
Woah!

[Hook: Dre & Freeway]
Lights get low (Low)
Let the music take total
The music take total control
Trol trol trol
Let the music take total
The music take total control
Trol trol trol (I got to hustle I got to grind)
(I got to hustle I got to grind)
Let the music take total
The music take total con...

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Born with the murder one
We got the hood burning up
Yea this what you want
My niggas know to turn it up
The white be with my city yea for me to run
You standin in a pool of blood
Youngin shoulda seen the sun
What you want to do tell me what you want to move
A good week for me another man a month or two
I'm into blowing and laying you niggas low
The feds tappin out and they fucking with figure fours
I dont wanna wrestle I wet em and then they froze
Me and Free hit every freeway around the globe
If she with me just know that she throw stacks
A quarter stick of dynamite off in that whole back
She the bomb, I'm the boss
Maybach that's my flight source
Count a mill with me shawty because you need to ride
You watch it freeze up you will see in time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Y'all rappers perpetrating
Free motivating
Put homes together like I'm the Great Lakes
Then use my dome acheing
I'm so patient
Struggling between my music and moving weight and
I can move a crate in
Less than an hour
And make hit in the same hour
It's so amazing
Matter fact free so hood
That I still hit the kinks
For three weeks I'm cool with asians
Nigga come at me going to lose
You need to fire them dudes
Who hike them up through his agent
Me & Cool & Dre will give you abrasions
Hit his chest because his hustle so soft
Dont make me go off
Treat this town like the brightest star
Grinds in the east the south an the west
If a nigga got beef I'm a put it to rest
God bless us when I tell him
That I leave him deceased
Now peep holla

[Hook]
