[Verse 1]
History repeats itself, I just came to get the belt
I just came to make your speakers melt, make sure my lyrics felt
I just came to scoop your girl, I just came to rule the world
My team split, didn't have a crew, I did this shit myself
Now I often pinch myself, besides the laws 'cause of me
One of a kind me, yeah I built myself
Too much partyin' and fast food, almost killed myself
Had to hit the match to reset, rebuild myself
Owner of my own company, I'm signed to myself
Rappers often say this but they lyin' to theyself
Went from welfare to millionaire, millionaire to health scare
Now I'm on the road with Hillary promoting healthcare
No elevation, you runnin' in place, stuck there
Play the cards I got even though they wasn't dealt fair
New fresh prince of Philly without the Bel Air
On my way to king shit, 'bout to back the Brinks in

[Chorus]
What you rockin' horns or a halo? how does your day go?
Flow heavenly, I give 'em hell but hell is way low
Start with fudge a prayer, top of the day though
Might end up at a party, nice tune your life
It's horns or a halos, how does your day go?
Flow heavenly but give 'em hell but hell is way low
Offer door a prayer, midday
Might still wind up at a party, nice tune your life
It's devils, it's angels, it's devils, it's angels
It's devils, it's angels, that's how this thing goes
It's devils, it's angels, it's devils, it's angels
It's devils, it's angels, where did your faith go?
It's devils, it's angels, it's devils, it's angels
It's devils, it's angels, this is how my days go
It's devils, it's angels, it's devils, it's angels
It's devils, it's angels, where did my faith go?

[Verse 2]
It's two sides, this is why we proofread the labels
We was warring with our neighbors so we bulletproofed the hoop rides
The truth lies underneath the hooplah
Convertibles retract and they reveal what the roof hide
That's how John F Kennedy died
You kidding me? ain't no more frenemies in my squad
In my hood, it's a few cold killers that know God
In my hood, it's like six churches and two mosques
Whole lot of gun shots, young niggas with ooh-wops
Flip sides, it's a few kids tryna get rich by
Goin' to school, it's a lot of teachers droppin' jewels
Got homies that's out, got homies on the insides
It's kids with both parents, it's kids with no dads
Everybody got a bad, everybody got a good side
Pray five times, daily connection with God
Long as we alive, only thing we do is strive

[Chorus]
What you rockin' horns or a halo? how does your day go?
Flow heavenly, I give 'em hell but hell is way low
Start with fudge a prayer, top of the day though
Might end up at a party, nice tune your life
It's horns or a halos, how does your day go?
Flow heavenly but give 'em hell but hell is way low
Offer door a prayer, midday
Might still wind up at a party, nice tune your life
It's devils, it's angels, it's devils, it's angels
It's devils, it's angels, that's how this thing goes
It's devils, it's angels, it's devils, it's angels
It's devils, it's angels, where did your faith go?
It's devils, it's angels, it's devils, it's angels
It's devils, it's angels, this is how my days go
It's devils, it's angels, it's devils, it's angels
It's devils, it's angels, where did my faith go?
