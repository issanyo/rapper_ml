[Hook: Neef Buck]
With or without
It's with or without
It's with or without
It's with or without
With or without
With or without
With or without
It's with or without
I'm getting' money
Fuckin' bitches
It all spend
So what's the difference?
Cocaine money
Rap money
You can get a 16 or get a pack from me

[Verse 1: Neef Buck]
These niggas talkin' 'bout money
Got 30 bands on me right now
Copperheads and that four-pound
Make you and your young boys pipe down
These niggas talkin' 'bout bitches
They moms done been around
From South Philly back to Nicetown
You new niggas, y'all all clowns
Indirecting on Twitter
Social network niggas!
Instagraming your clothes
I swear y'all worse than hoes
I'm good on the green, I'm good on the soft
Set the money off and I took a loss
If ain't sendin' or they ain't make it
It's all good, I'm still chasin'
Down the reefer on Silent Street
Eatin' Rasta Pasta, drinkin' rum and punch
Sittin' across from a bad bitch
Face and her body ain't average
Don't talk to me about jewels
Don't talk to me about women
How in the hell we got the same bands
When my seats up when I'm bendin'?

[Hook: Neef Buck]

[Verse 2: Neef Buck]
I take seven out of doubt and it's still locked
New Guccis, they Scott top
Smoke grey, mess with true religions
New line, got me in position
Fuck these niggas, fuck these hoes
Wore this shit once but I love my clothes
Got a Hublot that's rose gold
Cartier that's blessed down
Pay for it right in Nicetown
You can get served, nigga right now
My strip hot but my jackpot
Broomstick clip, don't get mopped

[Verse 2: Freeway]
We been gettin' money, don't shit stop
And if we don't OK then don't shit pop
You been wrong, but you afraid to say it
I be parlaying at your bitch spot
I sit in your drop, gettin' good top
Clean up her cum with your mop
I got the footage, she fiend for the didick
And that's why we did it on your couch
You are not invited to the
House party at your house
Me and Neef real, deal or no deal
We always being them whores out

[Hook: Neef Buck]

[Verse 3: Freeway]
My beard big, my cars is pretty
No spouse, house out the city
Every day I see bras and titties
These broke niggas been in bars with pennies
We eatin' like we should, good and plenty
Black Santa, I'm good with chimneys
I'll smoke y'all niggas then provoke y'all niggas
And hope y'all niggas try to rep y'all city
3-6-50, weighs 7-60
Black 5-50, juice, trap star heavy
Goin' for your gun but we're strapped already
You layin' on the ground cause you clapped already
Got dropped from the label, but I'm back already
Sad, but a fat nigga's strapped already
Got pushed one time and you're cracked already
Can't take it back, you a rat already
I swear, motherfuckers better back off
Duckin' motherfuckers with a hacksaw
We thug motherfuckers but we look good
We hard, but the level on a hacksaw
Flow raw like fuckin' with the hat off
Flow sick like fuckin' with a AIDS bitch
Blow shit up, young grenade dick
Got eight bricks, started with a 8 ball
