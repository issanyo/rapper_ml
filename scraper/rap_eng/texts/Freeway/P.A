[Intro: Freeway]
Statik Selektah
Yeah
Statik I can't hear the mic
Okay
Ugh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Freeway]
I am on my P.A. shit in my P.A. whip
Park Avenue driving down the P.A. strip
If you move them P.O.U.N.D.S's and P.A. 2-3
Careful who you rap into I run into
A P.A. snitch that'll be a bitch
Cause the people mess around
And get the D.A. tips
Got a long line of athletes
Doc J, Mike Vick, Allen I, 76
I'm Philly freezer
Call them Pittsburgh Miller
But our bronze never like to chip
Rocking on the mic, real stealer
Fulfill her
Every dream while we sexing
Take it straight
From the projects to the Villa
If you from P.A
You know where we shop at
Doctor dealer, King of Prussia, Sneaker Villa
Your state's real but my state's realer
Next year's Superbowl
Eagles vs. the Steelers

[Hook: Mac Miller & Freeway]
Where you from? P.A
What you rep? P.A
Tell them playa haters you was born and raised in. P.A
Grind with no Delay
I just came to say I go hard for P.A. (P.A.)

Where you from? P.A
What you rep? P.A
Tell them playa haters we was born and raised in. P.A
Grind with no Delay
I just came to say I do it all for P.A. (P.A.)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Hey, Motherfucker I'm from P.A
Right now in the B.K
Statik thats a DJ
Hear me rock the mic with Freeway
I've been up three days
Grinding you can tell it's Pennsylvania
The record keep on spinning
Like the devil from Tasmania
And we insane with the
Mic how we be blazing up
Andretti couldn’t race with us
I slow it down, change it up
That's just the way I does
Easy come easy go
I be chilling with the legends
Who was teaching me to flow
Young CEO
Donald Trump with better hair
P.A. got my back
Wherever I go I'm never scared
Lets just show the world
That the 'Burgh and Philly cool
Your girl memorizing the words of my interview
I tell these hoes I got a bed in breakfast
You can be tonight’s guest
I've been pimpin' since been pimpin'
Shout out Mike Epps
Statik drop the beat
Gotta delay quick
I'll tell 'em acapella
That I'm on my P.A. shit

[Hook: Mac Miller & Freeway]
Where you from? P.A
What you rep? P.A
Tell them playa haters you was born and raised in. P.A
Grind with no Delay
I just came to say I go hard for P.A. (P.A.)

Where you from? P.A
What you rep? P.A
Tell them playa haters we was born and raised in. P.A
Grind with no Delay
I just came to say I do it all for P.A. (P.A.)

[Outro: Mac Miller]
For P.A. (P.A.)
For P.A. (P.A.)
For P.A. (P.A.)
For P.A. (P.A.)
