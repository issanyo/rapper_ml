[Verse 1]
No rapper can rap quite like I can
No trapper can trap quite like I trap
I been around the world, I'm back, I been all over the map
That's when I'm in the funky monkey, Sandy throw me the grams
I'm talking Amsterdam, Freeway
Came through and I shut down Queens, yay
Every time I come around, the people want me to stay
But [?] down to the people, know how I do
Body every record, he don't get the message
But the girl wanna suck this with the diamonds in the necklace
Ate my dick for lunch, ate my dick for dinner
Had all the protein and took a vitamin for breakfast
Plus I went from a sqaud into a Lexus to a Benz
And I'm 'bout to get that Phantom in a second
Me and Big Ape back at it, yeah you know we do a song
Every time I hit the damn, what's the matter with you?

[Hook]
If you loving Amsterdam, put your hands up
If you repping for the States, put your hands up
[?]
Freeway and Big Ape, drop bombs like Kuwait
If you're from Holland, put your hands up
If you from the USA, put your hands up
Freeway and Big Ape, drop bombs like Kuwait

[Verse 2]
We the bomb droppers, we the numb cockers
Cross us, yeah, need 4 or 5 doctors
Best spirit ever, Big Ape, keep it real
And y'all actors need 4 or 5 Oscars
Y'all are not mobsters, ain't no way
You ain't Flloyd Money Mayweather, y'all are not boxers
Crazy thing is your girlfriend want the boxers
Grab on my pole through the hole in my boxers
My flow proper, live show proper
On top of that, my throw straight like my posture
Trapping out the state with my nigga, late show
And that motherfucker smoke like a rasta
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Check out the club, leave the party with a profit
All y'all rappers talking dope, need to stop it
Cause I got your dope money in my pocket

[Hook]
If you loving Amsterdam, put your hands up
If you repping for the States, put your hands up
[?]
Freeway and Big Ape, drop bombs like Kuwait
If you're from Holland, put your hands up
If you from the USA, put your hands up
Freeway and Big Ape, drop bombs like Kuwait
