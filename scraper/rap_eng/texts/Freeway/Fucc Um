[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, we know you used to put in work that's old
Nigga and we seen your paperwork you told
All these niggas either sniffing glass or they living off the past
When i'm blowing money fast with my bros
Lately I been seeing niggas sell they soul
How you catch a case and bail out on parole?
I've been state to state getting money on the road
Had to reevaluate who I could to talk to on the phone
Switch it up, spit the game pay attention, you should listen up
Follow code and one day you 'gon get as rich as us
Seven digit, street nigga that ain't rich enough
Forty million on the crib like that nigga Puff
Niggas buying yachts, niggas buying jets, that make me wanna buy the block just to reinvest
Help my young niggas catch it before it's nothing left

[Hook]
Baby me the realest ever did it yeah
Hopefully my day ones will remember this
Keep that shit a hundred one until the death
Even when i'm gone they'll say I never left
Lookin' at the roof like i'm glad I never quit
That's my niggas women though we'd never hit
Sticking to the script get rich and never switch
All my role models doing sentences, yeah
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Fuck each and every one of them
I fear none of them
Frank Lucas push his roof back in front of him
Leave a nigga toothless when it comes to the loot
I go stupid with the butt of the gun, know where i'm coming from?
North Philly where Fraizer and Muhammad sparred
Last named Ahkbar they calling all cop cars
When they pull you over, they might shoot you over moving
Now that we Truman they know who we are
They took a king from us, they X'd Malcolm out
You kidding me? I did my own black history
Studied Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt that's the main reason why these rappers can't get with me
Fuck em all, I hear the whistle know it's time to ball
Y'all niggas throwing fouls but y'all don't wanna brawl
How you going on a mission with no vision? Fuck Stevies like a sight look at Stevie's ambition, we hood niggas that get it

[Hook]
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all

[Verse 3: Cuzzy Capone]
Different nigga now that my pop's gone
Low tolerance promise you'd get popped on
Microwave the bullets sounding like popcorn
Grind heavy the cops come or the rocks gone
Same nigga, so what? The time's changed
When I couldn't get money I used to find ways
Counting thousands off the cavi in the hallway
It wasn't long before I figured out crime pays
We still in search of them bright days
Dark streets, only light when police raid
Where niggas stress out and let that shots off
Los Scan, like a skillet it'll pop off
I hit the ave and posted with the uncut raw
Sacked it up and told niggas I had the cake moss
Nothing fancy, protect myself with the eight ball
It wasn't easy I had to hustle on Hyde Park

[Hook]
Baby me the realest ever did it yeah
Hopefully my day ones will remember this
Keep that shit a hundred one until the death
Even when i'm gone they'll say I never left
Lookin' at the roof like i'm glad I never quit
That's my niggas women though we'd never hit
Sticking to the script get rich and never switch
All my role models doing sentences, yeah
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
