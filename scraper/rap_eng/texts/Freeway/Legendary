[Verse 1]
I remember when I couldn't get a penny for my thoughts
Last month just paid a buck 20 for the Porsche
No drug money, just pub money from my songs
I be stylin', first album had Mariah on the chorus
Boy I been a legend in a AC-Legend with my boys
On a Motorola celly, Pelle Pelle match the toy
On our hood shit, we wanna get fly, we go to Boyd's
Move keys, got the key to the city, I'm a boy
Get paid every day, all we do is bring the noise
Think not, when you get ya shot, you better not blow it
Similar to Goodfellas, we them airport boys
Last spring shut down Coachella, better know it
All we do is keep goin', ya chick give me the go ahead
She let me do it, love my music, I'm a poet
Since I came in it, I had the game sewn up
I'm from Rocafella, we helped the game grow up

[Hook]
Boy I been a legend
Rock the ring of legends
Ballin' on you sucka niggas, interception
Throw their hands up every time I touch down
Used to run the underground, look at us, we up now
Boy I been a legend
Still puttin' numbers up, this a blessin'
Throw their hands up every time I touch down
Used to run the underground, look at us, we up, nigga

[Verse 2]
Look at us, we up, nigga
When you droppin' somethin' new? Hurry up, nigga
Crossover, broken ankles, yeah I touch figures
And they said we couldn't go nowhere without!
Dough getter, check chaser
Rock stadiums, I used to give the package to your stepsister
Y'all broke niggas, y'all reck chasers
These faggots be always mad at me because my neck glisten
I vacate in the bless places
I guess hard work pay off, you eat off the next nigga?
Instead of manning up and givin' it your best, nigga
I'm a veteran, I'll give it to your best nigga
24/7 I'm a living legend, nigga
Try to get at me, I leave them with the reverend
Rappers try to get at me, I eat them all for dinner
Them ladies wanna leave y'all and come be with the winners

[Hook]
Boy I been a legend
Rock the ring of legends
Ballin' on you sucka niggas, interception
Throw their hands up every time I touch down
Used to run the underground, look at us, we up now
Boy I been a legend
Still puttin' numbers up, this a blessin'
Throw their hands up every time I touch down
Used to run the underground, look at us, we up, nigga

[Verse 3]
They love me cause I been a legend
Reason why that boy petty cause he been a peasant
Won't pay me, try to play me, get my men to bless him
Leave him injured, catch that nigga at the intersection
I guess these sucker niggas into hatin'
And I guess they hate me cause I'm into flexin'
Ain't nothin' change, I always stayed up in the best shit
They hated in '98 when I was in the Lexis
Don't test us, we there before you finish breakfast
I'm goin' for the gusto, you here on the guest list
My worst flow is way better than your best shit
These rappers full of shit, they congested
