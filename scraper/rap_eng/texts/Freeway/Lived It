[Verse 1]
I started with the hottest label ever, yeah
I came in the game like a kid with a cheat code
I'm from the neighborhood where the people
Sell drugs just to eat
Try to leave
But they barely make enough
Yeah, it's hard to make it out
It look like the legal system, easy and hard to make it out
Everybody got doubts
But I was down for the bout
I fought like Floyd Mayweather
I was screaming "Hey lover"
But them chicks said them niggas that ain't making no chips ain't loveable
Ain't huggable, ain't fuckable
The feeling that it gave me in my stomach was despicable
So I flipped bricks, grabbed the whip
And I pulled up in a 6, they was screaming "Hey loverboy"
A couple months passed, I grabbed another toy
They grabbed my [?] and my mother's boy


[Bridge]
Everything I write is vivid
Just like a TV with my Sharp ass
You see me when I dart past
I paint pictures, I went to art class
I lived it
I was raised by them hood rules
And raised by my mother's rules
I learned lessons, I went to summer school


[Hook]
You talk this, I live this
I want this, I need this
I'm of this, I am this
You talk this, I live this
I walk this, I breathe this
I'm of this, I am this

[Verse 2]
Flip bricks like a gymnast
Cooked up like a chemist
Them drug dealers was my temp agency
Easy way for me to get the Benjamins
Used to be thirst, get the grams from any man
Then I came of age and I flipped the middle man
Nowadays I'm fucking with the stage to get paid
Still keep a sawed-off aged to riddle men
Y'all kidding me, y'all little men
You better respect your elders, be gentlemen
Whoever told y'all "Come fuck with Freezer"
Was setting your dumb ass up for failure
Still keep a hem and I'm quick to nail ya
Billy Dee Williams, bitch, Colt 4-fiver
Leave y'all leaning like a Sprite two-liter
With promethazine and codeine
Full Freezer's flow is so lean
Mean
Mean

[Verse 3]
I'm dealing with facts only, everything real in my raps
I'm from Philly, that's the murder cap
And these rappers murder on tracks only
Way before I had a stack on me
Guarantee that that had a strap on me
Case a player hater tried to run up on me
Cock back, sit it in his hat
It's a new era
They killed Bin Laden, I'm the new terror
E420 wagon and I'm from that era
I'm from the crack era
My Uncle Ooh raised me, I'm from that batch
Used to drive in a tight ten hatchback
Now I got the BM, got the new Mercedes
Streets love me just like that Laubach
They hyped cause
