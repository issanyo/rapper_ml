Stress so we ground just to eat, oh I eat
Stress so we ground just to eat, oh I eat
Just in case a nigga wanna creep
You won't get me, you can't stick free
Yeah that's my name but ain't shit free
Don't be mad your chick pick me
Jealousy bring envy
Just have seen that he was jealous of Adam
So we wanna guess them yes in descriptions
Yes in different times but ain't much different
Such as such eat em, such as such wanna stick em
Even he react or be a victim
Lord be whiffin I hope he ..
'cause I'm sure he sending all this cards
All this women, now we starts
Here we are but I swear I'm feeling something different

Hook:
It seems like all the days that I starve
Replace with all the days that I am
It seems like all the times that I waste
Replace with all the places I've gone
It seems like all the days that I starve
Replace with all the days that I am
It seems like all the times that I waste
Replace with all the time that I'm demon
United Kingdom, Paris, France, where over there
I love England
How we get there? Fred singing
We do this, our music reach em
We on views visas me and Khalifa
My world slow up now where is Khalifa
Glass in session now is the teacher
Hip hop serving now is the preacher
Tommy Montana I am the future
Bright to all loss in the ripper
We're getting pace but it seems to speakers
No matter what we be at them mates don't leave us
Burn em on the waste time
Burn em on the waste line
Before I seat my grace I was on the block
I was flipping rocks, I was serving smokers base
Still I'm offering waste times
But it's different kinds
Now I'm in the studio f*cking with the base
Got your girl on face time, setting up the face
Hey attention nation, time is wasting
Got this tree send us in..then replace em
Will be E in dinners and then replace them
Work for no dog then do what..
