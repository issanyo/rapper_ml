I will always hold the position for you
I will always hold the position for you
Army, I go on a mission for you
We're fresh from NY, plenty backs from
Buddy pash you ain't gotta spend cash to get fly
Look I, know I'm, all around the globe while
You at home tryina make the best out your diploma
This is our dilemma, not to mention the chicks be on my
Sip whenever I strobe by, so whenever I go I
Get my, dough and then I leave, I tell you no lie
Even I'm at, the only thing is we forgot to have one
When we get together, it seems like it's nothing we can't tackle
Swear I go crazy off the scent of your aroma
You know them, niggas ain't gonn love you like I love you
Ain't gonn treat you like I treat you
Ain't gonn touch you like I touch you
Ain't gonn eat you like I eat you
Ain't gonn f*ck you like I f*ck you
And everytime I'm on the road, I'm always thinking of you, let's go
I got you, and you got me
Till death due us part, eternally
Right here and now, these are my vows
Whatever I promise, baby I'm a always hold you down
I'm a always hold you down, I'm a always hold you down
I'm a always hold you down, I'm a always hold you down, yeah
I'm a always hold you down
I know it's crazy tryina keep up with my crazy life
Overseas Paris days, west coast, Vegas nights
I would love to be like your cousin and his wife
But how, I come from them trenches on them benches with them white and win
Opportunity knocks, I'm chasing them bucks, I gotta take flight
How you think you got that beemer, how you think you got that ice on
Lights on, lights off, pull the Compton, it was 4 of the couples that draw
That was a nice call, to making cliff, nice falls
Taking fish, wake and bake, I can't wait to take another trip
I'm a superstar, make a wish
Black Santa, make a list, take a gift
Call me baby, make a kid
What's aching this, head to mind
It's how you flowning girl, you make me want it everytime
They say opposites attract, we vodka and milk
I'll love you even when you'll turn milf
You'll be forever mine
I got you, and you got me
Till death due us part, eternally
Right here and now, these are my vows
Whatever I promise, baby I'm a always hold you down
I'm a always hold you down, I'm a always hold you down
I'm a always hold you down, I'm a always hold you down, yeah
I'm a always hold you down
Down, down baby, down by the roller coaster
Sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go
We always arguing, ain't communicating
So I had to put my feelings in a song just to let you know
She's my baby, burn her in the shoulder
Host her, we hit the range so she ain't scared to let it go
She got that beemer, next whip is the range rover
Cause my chains growing, from strange flowing
Extra know, girl you get that extra hug, girl you get that extra love
Helped me when my chains was low
You brought me them trousers, socks, and know my favorite thing was low
You stuck by my side and you ain't know how far this thing would go
Came with no, ulterior motive, don't think I ain't nodes
Just stay focus and this thing will grow
Everyone in your family know, everyone that I hang with know
Next step is your hardest, so you can get where them angels go
I got you, and you got me
Till death due us part, eternally
Right here and now, these are my vows
Whatever I promise, baby I'm a always hold you down
I'm a always hold you down, I'm a always hold you down
I'm a always hold you down, I'm a always hold you down, yeah
I'm a always hold you down
