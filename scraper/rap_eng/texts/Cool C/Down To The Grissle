[E-Marvel]
'88 feeling great
Yo Cool, I'm tired of all this music stuff
That ain't Hip Hop music
Why don't you show 'em what time it really is

[Cool C]
Sitting here, writing a rhyme cos I'm angry
Cos people wanna change me
And what I do I didn't make it for you
Stop beefing you're through
Hip Hop started from the street
It's not soft just a grissle beat
Soft, that's a no-no
Hip Hop on the strength will keep you in the flow
So I must insist
All hell freeze and listen to this
Cos I'm taking it back
And if it's not hardcore then I call it wack
The point I'm trying to get across
Cos it seems that you lost the source
Any weak beat that's put on wax
Then commence with the weakest rap
And another thing, I've been thinking
Hip Hop ain't all about singing
That junk don't rock
Think you got the nerve to call that Hip Hop?
Man you're nuts, that ain't bumping
That's why I'm here to explain a little something
Singing, that's wack
I'm proud to say that I rap
Yeah, the beats make you jump
Move your rump, start your heart to pump
Destroying critters like a mad bomb missile
Hip Hop, down to the grissle

[E-Marvel]
Yeah, you know I'll rough a nucka
Cool C and E-Marvel from The Hilltop
On the ackniculous tip
Why don't you tell 'em what's up with the radio

[Cool C]
Listen to the radio, they wanna diss you
Trying to tell you what to do
I ain't for that, I'm gonna grissle them back
With the ill track
There's no music, I didn't choose it
Pump up the volume, you better use it
And play it, jocks keep complaining
I'm tired of playing the game, I quit
This is it
Back to straight up Hip Hop legit
Beats so hot, man it sizzles
(Yeah) down to the grissle

[E-Marvel]
It ain't nothing like Hip Hop music
And we ain't singing it, we bringing it
So you know the beat is kicking, chicken
But Cool C I think they want more
Give 'em more

[Cool C]
You want more (you know it)
The rhyme scores
Listen, it's hardcore
Down, all the way
You ain't, get away
Trying to make me work for free, that ain't me
Cos my name's Cool C
Back again on the grissle train
Getting dope, so I can get in
For real, Tat controls the wheels
Make one record and think you can deal
You can't, that's nut thinking
Thinking that, you must have been drinking
Sucker, you ain't saying nothing
Treat you like a target, and start begging on you
Cos man you're through
It's the Hilltop that's doing the do
Picking off suckers, like a chisel
(Why?) They ain't down to the grissle

Yeah that's right, down to the grissle
I'm chilling dear like a old head
DJ Tat Money thousands and thousands on the 1 and 2
Steady Boo B bumping on the beatbox
Fatal Attraction rocking the dance steps
Thick & Thin dancers in the house
Wild Crew in effect
3-D in effect, Chuck Nice, Woody Wood and EST
And yo, this goes out to all the people who's down with the real Hip Hop
And everybody else, and nothing
Take this in your face
