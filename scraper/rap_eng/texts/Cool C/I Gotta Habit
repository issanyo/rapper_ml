I gotta habit
It's like a disease
It pertains to crushing MC's
When I rock, I'm incidentally rage
I'm mad as hell on a sucka' rampage
Certain, for a sucka' to step
Take em' out and I bet I won't sweat
Create mo' rhymes six figure books
It's an addiction, yes I am hooked
Yes all for Hip-a-Hop
[?] spot and I can't be stopped
Cool, rips a bad habit
A dope beat like this man a mic I have to grab it
And show, that I can flow
Better than the rest when the beat is slow
It's [?] great say dang nabbit
And serving suckas' is my bad habit

I gotta' habit
It's just a habit
I gotta' habit

Cool C is back and he's in the spot
Here to explain about this habit I got
I'm known to rock the mic
I gotta have it like the people who pipe
Working hard, so I can get paid
Like to make money long as it can be made
I can't help it, I do what have to be done
Just to rock the show, we're just having fun
Always prepared to make that buck
So call em' Cool C, and tell em' what's up
I guarantee, that I won't fess
Like to make money cause' it's D-E-F
Down [?] never havin' a flaw
If you're not about money then you might as well crawl
Away, and have nothing to say
Cause' after every show I like to count my pay
Every time I see a mic
I gotta grab it, that's the way I get paid
It's just a habit

[You can't cope]
I gotta' habit
[You can't cope]
It's just a habit
[You can't cope]
I gotta' habit
[You can't cope]

I wonder if I stop and took a rest
Would the crowd still think I'm def
I guarantee, that the people say ho
I wanna know if they rock at my show
You're lyin' cause' it's truth ya' lack
You're smiling in my face talk behind my back
Cause' I rock the party every time I go down
Saying you could get cool now how the hell that sound?
I know I'm dope cause' you're going away
Each and every time I step up on stage
Especially, when the moon is white
Cause' my name is Cool C get the people hyped
Then I walk around cause I like to [?] style
Then I begin to exert my style
It's playing
Dope rhymes creating
When I break, who participates
Every time I see a mic
I gotta grab it, that's the way I rock shows, get paid
It's just a habit
Cool C's in full effect
Yo, it's just a habit
