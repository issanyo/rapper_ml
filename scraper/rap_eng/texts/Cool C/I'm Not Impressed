(Cool C)
Party people behold
Let the story be told
Cool C is back on a hype mode
[? 0:22] rotating all around this
Sucker get me pissed when they try to dis
The track is hype but I'm calm this this
DJ Twist, Tat Money, Zach Nichols
Yo this is my show turn up ya' stereo
Watch me as I flow
To a higher plateau
I came back to prove that I'm superior
Proving I rule to all of those inferior
The new jack, can't be whack
Out to attack, those who relax
Cause' I ain't taking no crap
I'm taking my respects so punks tip ya' hat
And get taxed, maxed, slapped and cold whacks
Calling me whack (I never liked that)
MC show rocker
Sucker MC stopper
MC hip hopper
Go ask ya' poppa
Who's the boot knocker
Ones clocker
Cool C money maker hill topper
Come around get down to the sounds
Once you hear it, you know I'm throwing lyrics, huh
You're fresh and ya' think you're deaf
Ya' think you got hype man, I'm not impressed

Ya'll don't impress the C! (Hes not impressed) x4

Sucker MC's [? 1:29]
Nah boy I got beef
Or [? 1:34]
I'm taught by the best
I'll pass you the dust pack
Can't top me, stop me or rock me
So instead you prefer to [?] me
MC's claim to be the best in this
But they're lame and need a little practice
Downgrade C, man forget it
Take a static from a crew like yours, I ain't with it
So clear your throat, you're living off hope
You should scope, the fact that I'm dope
Clout I'm doubting, you're still shouting
Another hit by C, now your pouting
It's the slayer, dope rhyme sayer'
Suckers I play ya' now paya-tention
Cause' that's trash ya' popping
The only thing ya' clocking is the time ya' watching
And you're telling that one ya' last strength
So ya' song ain't strong
Master teachers can't [? 2:15-2:19]
So ya' clocking, and ya' think ya' deaf
Ya' think you got hype man, I'm not impressed

Ya'll don't impress the C! (Hes not impressed) x4

Hype still calm, Cool is given
Taking what I'm given, man that's forbidden
Records, [? 2:46] ticking me off
Softer than soft They're showing them off
So I break em', destroy em'
Cause' they bore me
They're not dope, they have nothing for me
So I commence the dissing
I'm like a bomb, and I'm ticking
And I'm about to explode
[? 3:01]
You show em', that I know I was done
To make a dope album in the clock, real ones
I know they can't understand
Maybe it's because they can't and I can create dope music
And you chose to use it
But still, the real deal is
They hate to hear it, the beats to hype
Too many dope lyrics
I know it sounds confusing
So here's is an update on a starter I'm using
I pause, whenever there's a need
And after every verse [? 3:29]
Here's the real test, the point that I'm deaf, now tell me
Are you impressed? cause'

Ya'll don't impress the C! (Hes not impressed) x4
Break it down Tat
Steady Boo be booming
(Hes hes hes hes hes hes hes not impressed) x4
