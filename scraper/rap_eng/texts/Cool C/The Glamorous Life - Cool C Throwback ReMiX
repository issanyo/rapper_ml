[Intro]

[Verse 1: Daem Write]
That chain with the ring
Go with that
And the rims on the Benz
Would be phat
And some bricks in the street
Could get that...
And the pistol
Been known to get packed
In the cut
And I'm dressed in all black
They patrollin' and packin'
They gat
Chasing us while we chasin'
These stacks
We collide we both
Facing this gat
Best believe they kill us
No coincidence
BANG!
Law ain't blind
It's behind us
BANG!
Cuffs and a very big gun
BANG
Casualties will there only be one
BANG!
Shoot first -- never shoot last
BANG BANG!
Put on black, he puttin' on a badge
We both wanna make it to the crib
Everyday another blessing (if we live)...

[Hook]
Woo hoo!
You got it -- The Glamorous Life (Go! Go! Go!)
Woo hoo!
You got it -- The Glamorous Life (Go! Go! Go!)
Woo hoo!
You got it -- The Glamorous Life (Go! Go! Go!)
Woo hoo!
You got it -- I'm living the life (Go! Go! Go!)

[Verse 2: Daem Write]
No wealth here, just welfare
School systems dealt here
Poverty felt here
It's like our back's still
Bleeding from the whelps here
There's no help here
I feel like I never felt more pain
Than last year
But this it's more to fear
J's @ an all time high
We still wearing them
Rob yo ass blind
Kill em we deal with them
Making a killing
Killing for millions
Poverty, poor education
Overtime it's killing trillions
We trill in the streets we willy in
Enjoying every moment
Knowing one day
That the willy end

Dedicated to activating yo mind
Actively aggressively perfecting
Yo grind
I confess I'm in love with the shine
Fresh to death --
That's the reason that The Governor signed!

"Use what we got, to get what we want!"
"Use what we got, to get what we want!"
"Use what we got, to get what we want!"
"Use what we got, to get what we want!"

[Verse 3: Daem Write]
We both getting caught in the glam
He chasing after me cause the glam
I'm chasing after glam just a man
Casualties on both sides is the fam
I'm just a soldier in an ongoing war
Another body leaking laying on the floor
Another set of bars getting gripped
Another family tore apart just ripped!

[Hook]
"We gon' get on down now..."

[Verse 4: Daem Write]
Penalized for my efforts
Minority adolescents
Bureaucratic welfare state
Is what I'm kept in
Collectively occupying
The poor class
Poor corrective measures
Equal storms in the forecast
How long the locks on the door last
Well how about I storm past?
Glamorous Life I'm on that
Oppression got me lurking with protection
My homies: Dead. Locked up
These are my confessions!
