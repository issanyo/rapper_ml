Oh Ohhhhhh
You got it!
The glamorous life (go! go! go!) x 4

(Cool C)
She's a glamorous girl
And she came to rock my world
All the guys they wanna get with her
Step back cos you know you can't get her
First of all you gotta have money
Just in order to be her honey
But hey that's down the line
Cos I like a girl that's fine
Give her everything she wants
Gold and money so she can flaunt
And show that she got Gucci, Louis Vuitton
MCM styles of every kind
Mecca designed alpinas
This girl man, you gotta just see her
Sooner or later she'll be my wife
And that's when we'll live the glamorous life

All the girls envy my wife
Just because she's in the glamorous life
What she got they wanna get with it
But they're not doing nothing to get it
We're the talk of the town
Every time that we roll around
Other girls they just get jealous
When they smell her Perry Ellis
Or Obsession, or her Posion
You keep her away from the boys 'em cos
They might try to disrespect you
But don't let them upset you
Cos yo, they not that thoro'
To take away your girl
A girl that has no price
When she's in the glamorous life

You know what Cool?
When I was with Steady B
I had everything
I was rolling phat
Livin' large
I had all the luxuries in life
But when I was with that nut, EST
He didn't give me nothin'
It's like my mum used to say...

(samples, scratched)
We gonna use what we've got, to get what we want

(Cool C)
Yeah, girls like you Michelle is hard to find
That's why I had to make you my wife
So you could live the glamorous life
