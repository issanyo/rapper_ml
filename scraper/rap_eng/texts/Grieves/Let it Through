[Verse]
They told me to stay focused
Keep that money on my mind
But I'm starting to think that it's all bullshit
Run it, I wanna take it back to the basics
Back to the basement
Back to the old, gray pads and make statements
Follow it down
Momma watched me throw it all to the wind and rebound
Used to cry on the porch when I wasn't around
Now she smiles from the side of the stage when I'm in town, love ya
Ain't a better feeling than the work
Was a young'n when I started trying to put it into words
Now I'm grown, traveling the globe on a verse
Clock keeps ticking, I'll follow it to the dirt, chea
The worth, the price, the path
The man in the middle trying to keep it on the map
The train keeps moving down the tracks on schedule
So I just gotta open up the gates now and let it through

[Chorus]
Open up the gates now and let it through
Looking for a place with a better view
I've been on the wrong side trying
It's time to make moves
Open up the gates now, I'm coming through
Sick of playing games and the paying dues
Everything was upside down
But it's time now

[Verse]
They told me to stay humble
And I ain't ever cross that line
But I'm starting to watch where it was crumbled, jump
I wanna take it back to roots, back to the truth
Back to the rhythm, and the blues
Back to the chords on the Baldwin
Poppa let the record spin 'round like a calm wind
He used to look at me like I'm a ghost
Now he's calling on the weekends, talking 'bout home
There ain't another version of the past
They speak riddles, I'm only in it for facts
Young man made a future out of filling up the cracks
In the bottom of a boat they tried to label as crashed
Now the wind, the sails, the sea
The man trying to hold it all together by the seams
The [?] keeps floating like a dream on schedule
So I just gotta open up the main port and let it through

[Chorus]
Open up the gates now and let it through
Looking for a place with a better view
I've been on the wrong side trying
It's time to make moves
Open up the gates now, I'm coming through
Sick of playing games and the paying dues
Everything was upside down
But it's time now

[Bridge]
I'm opening the gates, following the sun out of the maze
Every single minute's been a haze
I return it to the page, I return it to the blood and examine it
Flow through the animus, roll though the foes
And the hoes and the plan of it
Never been a motherfucking fan of it
Never saw my name in the manuscript
I'm ick of looking for a place I can stand in this
All I wanted was to fly, listen to it

[Chorus]
Open up the gates now and let it through
Looking for a place with a better view
I've been on the wrong side trying
It's time to make moves
Open up the gates now, I'm coming through
Sick of playing games and the paying dues
Everything was upside down
But it's time now, yeah
