You're the weight of the water
You're the weight of the water

I don't know what to say
The levees are gonna break
And you don't know how to wade in the water
Falling out of the frame
You pick apart at the grain
And I don't know how to make it all better

I don't know what to say
The levees are gonna break
And you don't know how to wade in the water
Falling out of the frame
You pick apart at the grain
And I don't know how to make it all better
