Grieves: Dj Mark Nizzle was a big ass gangster (Someone sneezing in the background?)
Scott Jerry ____... Do-rag
Unidentified: Say bitch, come here over here
Com 'ere, fuck it you're garbage anyway, sleazy bitch
Yeah, Grieves, Seven Hill, Mark Nizzle

[Verse:]
____, Listen to your _____
Listen to the meaning in my words _____ your head swerves
Ducks, ____ dodging attention
You never thought that lyrics of a song would teach a lesson, but it does
Over-looked by many applicants
I'm sick of hearing songs about fake women and the cash you spend, don't
Spending your time killing your brain cells
While people in the streets wither and die just trying to stay well
They don't need this negative vision of living happy (what?)
This vision of negative living is given a Grammy (yeah)
And somehow, we all give it applause
And we don't think about its message or its negative cause
There's no thought (all trash)
Absolutely no message is taught when you talk about the sex and all the pills that you pop
Need to stop being gangsters, distorted and full throttle
Stop being criminals and start being roll models

[Chorus:]x2
Garbage
Feel this world is crumbling around me
Full of criminals, drugs, sex, cash, and cars
This is garbage
People slowly drowning in this tar pit
Sucked into the market of guns, death, and coffins

[Verse Two:]
Two
What the hell is going on around us (ridiculous)
These gun wielding thugs are seeping into the childhood
Young minds trying to be a gangster's apprentice
What the hell happened to just trying to make a difference
Go to school (yeah)
Be a teacher
Be a doctor
Help someone who really needs it
It's deceiving and leaving society without a meaning
When everyday is born, I pray to God that I don't see it
But I do
Every single day reflects the last one
I try to make a difference, but nobody wants to have none
But that's not that fact that's been getting me pissed
Getting pissed cause this negativity is reaching the kids, it's sick
So sick I want to cry
When a gun shot brings out, another child dies
And we try to protect them from this filth, but it's hard
The violence from the media is taking over their thoughts


[Chorus:]x2
Garbage
Feel this world is crumbling around me
Full of criminals, drugs, sex, cash, and cars
This is garbage
People slowly drowning in this tar pit
Sucked into the market of guns, death, and coffins

[Verse Three:]
Three
What happens when your words turn into reality
When shit really pops off
You forgot your calvary (what now bitch?)
Did you think that you would be safe?
When all you talk about is guns and all the money you make
You better pray that when he does that you're a man of your word
Because your songs try to tell him that you'll never be served
That's a good enough reason for your creation to step
He was raised from your words and now he's ready to test
Full potentially gangster mentality seems to rest
With a gun, to the bullet, to the chest
To the head, now it hits
Now you rap about your bullet proof vest
Just ____ in all the people that was after your head
You taught him this
Your imagination fathered this
You talk like your hard, now these kids want a part of it
A vicious circle
Now you search for the breath to try to send a meaning out so they can learn from your death
It's

[Chorus:]x2
Garbage
Feel this world is crumbling around me
Full of criminals, drugs, sex, cash, and cars
This is garbage
People slowly drowning in this tar pit
Sucked into the market of guns, death, and coffins

Yo peace out in Seattle, one love
Fuck you Nizzle
