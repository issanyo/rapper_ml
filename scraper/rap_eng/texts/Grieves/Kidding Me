[Verse 1: Grieves]
Last time I wrote a song like this I was drunk off the last words out of your lips
And what a world –
You were always looking for attention, I was holding on to my abandonment obsession
In hindsight –
I was just as ignorant as you were, blinded by the "you" word combined by the sutures
Good-bye to the cruel world, you had to be out, and I caught you with another dudes -–-- in your mouth
Goddamn little lady, how’d you get so cold?
How’d life teach you all the little tricks you pulled on me?
Hopelessly passionate, openly act as if everything is all my fault – no sacrifice
Nah, I should’ve seen it from the start, red dress laying on the floor in the dark
You were everything I wanted but nothing that I needed
My sexy little piece of shit demon, leaving

[Hook]
I used to say that I loved you
I used to act like a fool
But now I hear that you’re wondering, if the girl I run with
Is treating me cool –

You fucking gotta be kidding me
Look at all that you did to me
Why the hell would you be wondering who’s kissing me now?

[Verse 2: Grieves]
Last time I had a thought like this I was locked in my room with a bottle in my fist
What a world –
I was trying to pick apart the pieces, even moved to Cali with you, living by the beaches
Egregious –
Made a dude want to find Jesus, huddled in bunker with nothing but canned peaches
If I was a weaker man I would’ve broke down, the second I caught you getting your sex around town
God-damn, what a hell of a ride, Cinderella got drunk and started spreading her thighs
The fairy tale’s over, after telling me lies – became a rock in the belly of the reason we fight
Yeah, I should’ve seen it from the jump, I should’ve shut the door on your face and called you a -–-
Everything I wanted, but nothing that I needed
My sexy little piece of shit creampuff, biatch

[Hook]
I used to say that I loved you
I used to act like a fool
But now I hear that you’re wondering, if the girl I run with
Is treating me cool –

You fucking gotta be kidding me, look at all that you did to me
Why the hell would you be wondering who’s kissing me now?
