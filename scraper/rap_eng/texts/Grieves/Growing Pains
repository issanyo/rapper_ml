(Verse 1)

It was a pick up, like a microphone
Life is too damn short to not even right my wrongs
I had a dream inside a dream and it was all about you
And I've tried to think of what I'm gonna do
Tried to think of how I'm gonna make the past the present
Because I hate to think about every second that we're separate
But I've left us in a desert, I regret the way I've messed it all
North, My directions were jumbled, I'm not perfection (But I"m worth it)
God shaded in my past with all his might
And it's why I think I fell in love with night
Twenty something days until I'm a year away
From leaving everything I've ever known to see it fade
Wish that I could see your smile one more chilly morning
Now my story ends a selfish one without a point and boring
Time was cut short, but still enough to make me fall
Tell me how am I supposed to reach anything, anything at all

(Chorus)

Tell me how can I grow to see the change in my life
I wanted, to overcome the battles inside
What is owed to anxieties hold
Is there a better way to figure us out

(Verse 2)

Crazy how the world is just a bunch of people fueled by emotions
Take these letters as a treasure and a token
Buy yourself a cookie just to check your own fortune
It tells you that the who that you will hear is not a Horton
Man, I used to read "Oh The Places You'll Go"
Dr. Seuss used to teach me what I know, Oh
What a show I have seen, I love drama
It's always really funny unless you're the one that caused it
Lost within a trance waiting on a second chance
For a bid to do the devil's little dance
Waiting on the winter just to breathe in the window
Showing you complexity is nothing more than simple
By drawing you a heart, telling you to go and frame it
Then I will awake and never say that last statement
Looking at the screen I don't feel so tall
So tell me how am I supposed to reach anything, anything at all

(Chorus)

(Instrumental)
