[Verse 1: Grieves]

My whole life, I've been staring out the cracks
Slipping words amongst the people that get close enough to grasp it
You're looking at me like another broken glass
Getting closer to the edge with our emotional attachment
And, maybe you won't see that all of this around you
Is a simple web of lies that was designed to make you soundproof
That's exactly why I scream like all the proud do
And slam against the gates with my music until I plow through
I see the smiles and your frowns
And you feel like everything in your life is nailed to the ground
I see you speak with the same distaste in your mouth
While everything breaks you down to the bottle trying to drown yourself
I guess there's no hope left
All the ships are leaving port and the wine is smelling like death
You can smoke it 'til there's holes in your chest
'Til you're breathing out your last cold breath
I wish I could've told you

[Hook: Grieves]

All your demons, are gonna getcha
And all your demons, are gonna get you
And all your demons, are gonna get you
And all your demons, are gonna get you

[Verse 2: Grieves]

And this [?] is full of them
From the bar to the booth
Leave the guitar in the corner and stray far from your roots
Never, thanked your father for infecting your youth
With a healthy taste for violence and 150 proof
And, all you ever learned from life, is an ice pack
Is good to stop the swelling and for chilling down your pint glass
Every evening as you open up your night cap
You drink yourself away like it's the only way to fight back
I can show you how I feel and what it does to me
And how I look you in the face and see what has become of me
And, I'm a product of your liquid courage company
That drowned away your sorrows before you knew that they were running free
So, breathe in, and breathe out
Blur the space between us and constrict me when I reach out
And break the mirror so you never have to see out
And know that you were talking to yourself
I wish I could've shown you

[Hook]

[Bridge]

It's the bottom of the bottle
It's the bottom of the bottle

[x10]

(You hit the bottom of the bottle
It's the bottom of the bottle
You hit the bottom of the bottle
It's the bottom of the bottle)
