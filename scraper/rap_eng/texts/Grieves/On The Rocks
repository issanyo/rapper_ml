[Verse 1: Grieves]
I ain’t no scholar, I don’t write no books
I done spent my money on my last girl honey and she hates my guts
I paid my rent late, so my landlord's angry
And all this shit keeps piling up and tryin' to hang me
I get my lovin' on the run (on the run)
So don’t you try to slow me down and walk around it
Sick of tryin' to strum along, wit yo' love song
So leave me here to pour another drink on the rocks

[Hook: Grieves]
Oh, all of this will hold you, down onto the ground
Until you're crawling on the gravel like a regular guy
Oh, all of this will hold you, down onto the ground
Until you're drowning in your sorrows with a bottle of rye

[Verse 2: Grieves]
I ain’t got no savior, I ain’t got no time
I know I'm stuck with a problem that'll come through and swallow up my last dime
All I wanted was some peace and quiet
To take me out of here before I start a riot
Lost my reason; I done lost my way
I done sat here for hours and heard all the songs that the jukebox plays
So keep your sunny days away from here and I'll
Pour the liquor down
And smile while I say

[Bridge: Grieves]
Life’s been on the rocks I’ve taken
My last shot at holding on to
Life’s been on the rocks I’ve taken
My last shot at holding on to
(All of, all of, all of)

[Hook]
Oh, all of this will hold you, down onto the ground
Until you're crawling on the gravel like a regular guy
Oh, all of this will hold you, down onto the ground
Until you're drowning in your sorrows with a bottle of rye
