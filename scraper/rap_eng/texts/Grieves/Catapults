I feel like the last lit candle in the back of my mind
Both palms to the future, so slack in the line
But no qualms with it i don't flip a coin like the rest of em
Or fall into line and live life by the pendulum
And never would i sell my soul
Find the beauty in the little things you can't control
Break the mold from it look you can see tomorrow in my eyes
And expect nothing less than a lesson in disguise
When the clouds clear heavens just a six letter word like crutch
Hanging on the syllables and verbs of trust
And this is why i walk where the road ends
And live inside that little space where the notes been
Like this is all that ever made sense
My hopes, my flesh, my bones, my breath
Exposed
Holding onto to truth like it's slipping and the cliffs edge is cutting the rope
I think it's time to let go


[Chorus]
Look at what you started
Got the whole world holding their heads in their hands
Trying to find a reason
Trying to figure out the pieces to find another meaning to believe it

Look at what you started
Got the whole world shaking their fists at the sky
Trying to find a reason
Trying to blame it on the momma like it's coming through to take away their jesus

I see the glow in the window from the street
And i seek truth through the passion i release
And absorb it all of this has torn apart the seams
And explained to me that i don't need a hand to hold the dreams
And i don't need to stand in front of god to intervene
With a devil that's inside trying to take away my dreams
I created play my little life on the strings
Carve a sentence out of silence and wear it like a ring
To remember hell is just a four letter word like fear
Tracing the reflection of your tears
I've been choking on my everything for years
Trying to force a meaning into anything that smudged the mirror
Like i learned that this is not about control
No wins no loss no points no goals just go
Holding onto the truth like it's slipping and the cliffs edge is cutting the rope
I think it's time to let go


[Chorus]
Look at what you started
Got the whole world holding their heads in their hands
Trying to find a reason
Trying to figure out the pieces to find another meaning to believe it

Look at what you started
Got the whole world shaking their fists at the sky
Trying to find a reason
Trying to blame it on the momma like it's coming through to take away their jesus
