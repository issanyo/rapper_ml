[Intro]

[Verse 1: Grieves]
I was in the second grade when you pushed me out the
Third story window to the bushes down below
Breathing in the cold
As I tumbled through the vines' thorns smiling at my throat
I, I saw the devil in you that day
Looking down at me with that face
Smiling like you would have hid my body in the basement
Body in the Basement
But you got something that the world's been running from
For way too long and it's a sick twist
A nervous little twitch
Dragging the razors across my wrists
And you got something that the world's been trying to hide
You're cyanide
Cause the only thing you told me was
They'd never find my body in the basement
Body in the basement, no

[Hook: Grieves]
Every time I think about you now I go crazy
People ask me about you
I don't know what to say
Cause I don't know who you are
I wonder if it's even possible for you to escape this
Keep on asking about you
They don't know what to tell me
They don't know who you are [x2]

[Verse 2: Grieves]
I was listening through the wall when you met your monsters
Heard'em break the closet door and take you away
Hoping you would change like the color of the moonlight
Bouncing off the rain
I, I heard the devil in you that day
Watch the world around you cascade
Laughing like you would have fed your family to the serpent
You got something that the world won't talk about
They walk around it
It's deep sleep, crawling in the street
Pushing the bayonet into me
You got something that the world keeps trapped inside
You aconite
Cause I watched you turn around
Go and try to feed you family to the serpent
Family to the serpent whole

[Bridge]
These words won't break on you I know
I've done my best to help so many times before
These words won't break on you I know
I've done my best to help

[Hook]
