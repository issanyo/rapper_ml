[Verse 1]
I'll take a breath of that concrete
Step into the jungle with a gleam
And move like it's trynna kill a dream
Cause I don't' have a bone left in me
That'll loan death pity when the grass I'm growin don't green
Ode to the screams
Bouncing off the glass of the storefront window when the reaper walks past
We don't have a grasp on the future
So the past that we're used to
Is all that we ever want back
Running with the axe
Trynna chop the whole world down
Trynna fight your little trip to the ground
Cause you don't wanna see the truth
Of the last breath made when the smooth song plays to the silence of sound
Yeah you will be found
And whether or not you want it to happen
I can guarantee it will go down
SO stop with the fighting
We're all kind of frightened
But I don't see the purpose in trynna cheat death

[Hook]
I'm so sick of this pace
Running around in circles trynna skip his blade
You cannot hide from forever
Inside from the weather
On the day you planned escape
He'll find you down and out, high and dry
Leave you face down dead in your ways
I can't go anywhere
Everywhere that I turn, I see you're all that I know
I know [x2]
Everywhere that you go...
Everywhere that you go...
Everywhere that you go...
Follow...

[Verse 2]
I see it all from perspective
Floating on a dark cloud casted over fear of the view of where death is
Live by the setlist
Never say die with a fist in the air till the world stops spinning and we're breathless
Damn, running from a natural advance that'll end with you lyin where you stand
And I can see the fear in the end of it
But never had ran
Cause never dying doesn't seem to be a plan
SO I live for the moment
Never let the dark cloak change me, or make me be a person that I'm not
Cause if I'm gonna die now
Then I'd rather die proud
For the fact that I went out and gave it everything I got
Name in the rock
Rose on the ground in the grass that'll grow in the soil of my plot
When I laid down to rest
Carving in the stone or a crest
Never cheat life to cheat death

[Hook]
I'm so sick of this pace
Running around in circles trynna skip his blade
You cannot hide from forever
Inside from the weather
On the day you planned escape
He'll find you down and out, high and dry
Leave you face down dead in your ways
I can't go anywhere
Everywhere that I turn, I see you're all that I know
I know [x2]
Everywhere that you go...
Everywhere that you go...
Everywhere that you go...
Follow...
