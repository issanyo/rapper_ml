I’m not a person of my words anymore
I exist inside a dream that was started by a child that now lives inside of me
I can’t play anymore
I’m falling off the edge and fighting every urge I’ve ever had to strike it down and leave it dead
I make music
Pain made me want to take to it, Fate drew it right in front your mothafuckin face, use it, right?
But there’s a different way you view my life, so meet me in the middle and throw rocks from the room you hide in
I get inside it, How sick its mind that it’s got me reaching after something like I thought that it was tryin to find me
Lost, and it’s harder than expected
Spotlights burn the part of me that shouldn’t be affected
And I try to be simple, don’t put me on a pedastle
I’m twice as fucked as everyone and scared like all the rest of you
Please, all I want is peace when the sun sets
To breathe in and taste what hasn’t come yet
Listen to my words

[Hook x2]
Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind, I was fine, I was good, I was faithful
Now I’m crazy and I’m lost and I hate you
Because you took it all away from me

I chose my own path and left home without a road map
Dressed for sunshine, should have known better to pack
For those days that would turn rainy, cold, and black
See I heard the stories, but I didn’t know the facts
I assumed all was perfect from the photographs
Til the light hit the surface to expose the cracks
What’s worse than not knowin if you’re still on track
Paranoid and having thoughts about turnin back
I’ve seen dreams transform into the worst disease
And almost let the doubt kill my will to succeed
But I traveled too far to turn around and leave
Get angry, pound my fists in the ground to bleed
Hoping to break my creed and sit at a table with thieves
Tricks up their sleeves, saying how my music should be
I keep on with the profits, and building with Grieves
Knowing one day I’ll prove what I’ve always believed
Eventually, I know that day will be seized

[Hook x2]
Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind, I was fine, I was good, I was faithful
Now I’m crazy and I’m lost and I hate you
Because you took it all away from me
