She said the world paints a picture, that makes her wanna run
Pull the stars out of the sky and load them into her gun
Live wire, broken and its taken its toll
You can't reach what has never been touched, its too cold
Cuz the sun dont shine for her, she said calmly its a fact
That she learnt to adapt, and move on with it
I dont know if I should smile or not
Or pull that ice box out of her chest and help her thaw
Cuz she fights like a lover, but sleeps with the enemy
And asks like shes only getting close, just to empty me
Gwenevieve, another hook for the line
And a perfect little painting of disaster in its prime
And I love it, solely cuz it makes me feel alive
When she sets the world ablaze and see the fire in my eyes
Shes the lion in disguise as the prey in the pasture
Breakdown, build up, agony, the rapture

[Bridge]
Look at you, the blood from it will taste like wine
And fill that little glass that you hold up high
You wanna walk with the shovel in line
Tried to bury every single little thing that ever made you feel alive
Youre alone now, just the way you drew it in the dust
And the walls that protect you from ever showing your trust
If I could show you what its like from the inside
Id open up that coffin you been hiding in and speak like

You dont need to see the fire to smell the gasoline
Toss another lit match to the bridge
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burnt it down
Burn it down, Gwenevieve you burn the whole world around you and
You dont need to huff the smoke for the cancer
Take another step away from your chance
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burnt it down
Burn it down, Gwenevieve and take a shower in its ashes

I wonder what happened to make you like this
Break it, and leave you throwing stones where the lights dim
You got a smile on your face like a sliced wrist
And grin like you got a couple spikes in that ice kiss
You like it, youre just too afraid to say it
So break it into pieces and add it to your mosaic
And nail it to your heart little artist, and protect it
And murder any perpetrator eyeing your investment
Cuz love can't bite you if you keep it on a leash
Fate can't catch you if you take away its feet
Life can't tell you shit without speech
So you hide where the lonely eyes on you couldn't seek
Youre alone, like the last dead petal on a rose
Picked from the common ground, just to watch it grow
Or die, Gwenevieve, a ghost in the night
Smell smoke, see the glow in her eyes, I try to tell you

You dont need to see the fire to smell the gasoline
Toss another lit match to the bridge
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burnt it down
Burn it down, Gwenevieve you burn the whole world around you and
You dont need to huff the smoke for the cancer
Take another step away from your chance
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burnt it down
Burn it down, Gwenevieve and take a shower in its ashes

You dont need to see the fire to smell the gasoline
Toss another lit match to the bridge
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burnt it down
Burn it down, Gwenevieve you burn the whole world around you and
You dont need to huff the smoke for the cancer
Take another step away from your chance
Burn it down, burn it down
Burn it down, burnt it down
Burn it down, Gwenevieve and take a shower in its ashes
