[Hook]
Take a look at my life
Take a look at my love
Take a look at my soul
Baby you can't save me
You don't know
There's an empty pot to piss in at the end of the road

[Verse 1]
I've got too many problems
And not enough solutions
Rain that makes you think im lost in God's illusion
You know that America loves it
Another sunken battle ship
Another stranded photo book with all my pictures plastered in it
I ain't got a pass but still I'm walking like a free man
Holding onto heaven while questioning why I feel damned
And this is something that I've tragically adapted to
Cellophane my heart to pull the knife out of my back from you
And God won't tell me if he wants me to live
Don't speak to me in the way you portray in your hymns
Don't breathe through me in the way that you live
Don't treat me differently when Satan insists
And this is it
I gotta hold it to the grave
Gotta breathe life into this desert I roam in shame
Hold a leaf by its windowsill and leap from its pane
And paint one city block with my unedible fate
It goes
I can't taste it

[Hook]

[Verse II]
I can't taste it
Cuz it all gets lost
Can't register its meaning till I figure out its cause
So don't you look at me like just another feather
Fallen from the wings of the angel sent to protect you
I'm tragic
And it all now shows
Blacking out before the rain comes and wakin up soaked
I try to pretend that I'm far from what's painfully close
And face this displacement of hate in what I faithfully chose
But this is obvious
And thats exactly why you freeze
When you crawl behind my eyelids and peep what I've been seeing
When you fall into your silence
I find out what they mean when they say that its the quiet ones that always wanna scream
So hush
Its not about your words
Your force fed holyness will only make this worse
Your lore drenched loneliness are scorchin the burns of what God really feels like compared to your words
Its goes
I can't taste it
