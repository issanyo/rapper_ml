[Singer:]
And now, for my masterpiece (Aw boo)
Rudolf the red nosed reindeer, didn't have any friends (Oh you got to be fucking kidding me)
And because he was lonely, he didn't have any friends (Oh my God)
Rudolf the red nosed reindeer (Are you fucking retarded?)
He was so lonely and gay (Jesus Christ)
Rudolf the red nosed reindeer (Come 'ere, hey jackass)
He didn't have any- (Give me that fucking shit)

[Chorus:]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch (Damn right mother fucker)
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch (I'll fucking eat your kids)
You're a mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean one (Suck my dick)

[Verse:]
Yo, I said bitches want to make me smile
Punch a mother fucking baby in its mouth just to prove my style
Got a heart like an ice block
And teeth made of glass that I used to peel the flesh off of The Ghost of the Christmas Past
And I'll laugh, not because I'm happy, cause I'm crazy
A castle made of bones on the hillside, I'm crazy
And fuck you if you actually think that you can persuade me, that Santa Clause is watching my behavior
You're crazy

And all of this has gone too far
Don't want to sing your songs
Don't want to gather around your fire
A mother fucker's much colder than that

So tell your children not to come around my way when it's cold out
I'll snatch the little carols that they say out their own mouth
And eat them right in front of them
Leave 'em running, gunning, back to their town
I'm a Grinch mother fucker, I'm happiest when I frown

[Chorus:]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch (Damn right mother fucker)
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch (I'll fucking eat your kids)
You're a mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean one

[Verse Two:]
You see, everybody knows my name
Cause I don't give a flying fuck about a fat-ass riding 'round on a sleigh
I'm an O-G Gangstar
I mean what I say, and if Saint Nick is listening then tell him to come and play
Cause I'm ___ ___ ___ ____
An elf is no match
And that Rudolf ain't nothing but a ___ to get blasted and eaten
You're dealing with a mother fucking heathen
That spawned from the venomous serpent they found in Eden

So tell 'em all to crash and burn
Spill the ash from burning
I'm looking at you through a rifle side and smiling
This mother fucker's not holding me back

So tell that rowdy son-of-a-bitch that I'm waiting and been tricking all winter
A box full of bear traps and dogs without dinner
Got a whole lot of bitter ain't no calming me down
I'm a Grinch mother fucker
I'm happiest when I frown

[Chorus:]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch (Damn right mother fucker)
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch (I'll fucking eat your kids)
You're a mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean, mean one
