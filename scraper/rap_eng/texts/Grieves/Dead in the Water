What did you want from me?
You're knocking on doors
Tryin' to wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You want to settle the score
You want to level the board
You want to level me down

What did you want from me?

I find it funny how your heart don't work
And that tattoo'd diamond on your chest spells hurt
How predictable, just another shark in the blood stream
Swimming its way up stream, to figure out where love sleeps
And kill it like it must be stopped
I don't see the reason in your logic, I just understand the plot
And if I don't find it out of here, I swear to god I'll pop
From the needles you've been sticking in me, trying to throw me off
When I fly straight, Just another meal for the vultures
Picked into pieces and burried under the boulders
Until the last cracked molar is found
I'm just a victim with the soul torn out of him and shot to the ground
Without the glory, broken
And thats the way that you like it
With the war horns fired up, stimulating excitement
And, I can see why the devil put you in ranks
But should have asked you what you wanted before you flashed me the fangs
You've got a problem

What did you want from me?
You're knocking on doors
Tryin' to wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You want to settle the score
You want to level the board
You want to level me down

What did you want from me?
You're knocking on doors
Tryin' to wake up the beast
Head full of thorns

I've been living in this winter you've provided me
And eating all these pages of this history inside of me
For what? Just so you can run around the graveyard
And scream into the heavens and sink the boat that you came on
I've taken all the pain I can
And plan on jumping off this ship before I lose it and never know who I am
Before this vessel ever gets the sight of land
I would dive into the waters underneath it and take my chances at hand
Until it drowns out, you've got a perfect way of killin' me
An angel in appearance, with a smile like a gulletine
And I don't think that you could ever change
Pain is your Nicotine and fightin' me's the flame and it stays that way
Because everything is frozen in your steps
And displayed as a trophey for your unexpected guests
You're a monster, and I can smell it rotten in your teeth
Hope that you can figure out what you've been looking for and leave
You've got a problem

What did you want from me?
You're knocking on doors
Tryin' to wake up the beast
Head full of thorns
You want to settle the score
You want to level the board
You want to level me down
