I blow the dust off of the cover when I make my pick
Blind melody, the ghost in the hallway that jumps to the kick
My vision taking on a whole new level that'll blindside the devil when these cold words hit
So get in and dance to the crackle
Run around and flinch from the sound of the gavel when the judgement lands
Break the silence with my own young hands
So I can replace emotion where the boneyard stands
Time ticker, lost in the grit, tryna find a better way to solve it than jumping off of a bridge
Feeling tied down and tortured in all of the ways there is
Is not gonna help me when the white light splits
Theraputic, fiend for the music
Floating on the last boat sent from the cruise ship it saves your soul
It's time to take this show on the road
It's the one-man vessel people claim that they know

I'll go
This is not home
Chewing all the love songs, spitting out a poem
That's sitting on the phone in the place I chose
My blood will run warm when the cold wind blows
I'll go
And never come back
Riding on that train down a one way track
I'll break that glass
And I'll never look back
Even if they all laugh I wil never feel trapped and fade to black

Lay the needle where the pain stems
And dig around for the source
Pump my veins full up of all of the little things that I force
I'm a worm for direction and got a little bit off of course
It'll find you, re-invent everthing that you scored
Life writer, thrown from the cast
Catapaulted over that wall in which they constantly try to mask
And if that don't save me I'm probably going to crash on impact
Holding my broken pen in my grasp

Goodbye
Wind to the trail
Traveller, the last note spoken over grown folks chatter
The last rope thrown after I broke that ladder that it let me climb up and join the calamity
Dance and move to the freedom
Pick another lock and escape when the beat comes to save your soul
It's time to take this show on the road
It's that one man vessel people claim that they know

I'll go
This is not home
Chewing all the love songs, spitting out a poem
That's sitting on the phone in the place I chose
My blood will run warm when the cold wind blows
I'll go
And never come back
Riding on that train down a one way track
I'll break that glass
And I'll never look back
Even if they all laugh I wil never feel trapped and fade to black
