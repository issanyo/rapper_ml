The night is like a blanket that's suffocating the fire
With a bow to the string and a note from the choir
I believe, and that's about as far it goes
When you've been riding on the wings of a bloody murder of crows
Hold it all out, throw it into the wind
Let it lay down the line where the drama begins
Because if everything is covered and teetering on a whim
You can harmonize the sound of it's insecurity's hymn
When it's played, yeah, stripped down and shaved
Shipped off to battle in the shadow of the day
And if anything is salvaged from the battered up remains
You can sew it to your jacket and compensate for the pain
When it hits, when it speaks
Lick the blood right off of it's teeth
You'll grip those sheets in attempt to hide
And figure out that you've been running from the feeling of never leaving alive so

Hide, sleep with the lights on
You feel like you can be at peace with the lights on here
So cover up your face, and fight away that taste
That makes you want to run and hide, hide, hide
And sleep with the lights on
You stand up on your tiny feet when the night's gone here (Night's gone here)
When the night's gone here

Swallow that lump inside of your throat
Open up the closet and push aside all the clothes
You believe, and never needed more to be said
To leave you scared of that little gap between the floor and your bed
So you jump, leaping over all over your options
And retreat right back to that bed we call a coffin
To sleep, never actually getting a wink
Due to all the little devils that dance around in your dreams
And attack you, pull you under the bed with their hands
And take away the chance of you ever making a stand
And if anything actually ever went as you planned
That you could retrace the steps you ran
But only if it hits, if it speaks
You could fight it to the death in the streets
You'll grip those sheets in attempt to hide
And figure out that you've been running from the feeling of never leaving alive

So hide, you'll stay awake
So hide, we all know that you'll stay awake

Hide, sleep with the lights on
You feel like you can be at peace with the lights on here
So cover up your face, and fight away that taste
That makes you want to run and hide, hide, hide
And sleep with the lights on
You stand up on your tiny feet when the night's gone here (Night's gone here)
When the night's gone here
