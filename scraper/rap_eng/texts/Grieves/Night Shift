[Verse 1]
Tattered ghost ships sailin' outta sight
I've been writing about them most of my life
Couldn't find it in my heart of hearts to lie about the fight
So I set it all on fire and disappeared into the night
Now you were looking for some flaws?
Let me hit you with that list
Some of y'all were talkin' at me like I didn't own my shit
Bloody murder was that script
Now I'm walking on a fine line carefully
I don't need anyone takin' care of me
You seem a little shocked
Is it 'cause you smell the kerosene?
'Cause I made a profit out of using my self-destruction as therapy
I own that
I put it out in front and let the cold pass
But you still try to chip away my highs like you use a low pass, so fuck it
This is not the first time I've had to cope
Or had to measure out the distance of the gallows rope
I tasted every single toxin in that cloud of smoke
Surroundin' you allowin' you to pretend that you know, but you don't

[Hook]
If-if you were pushin' through that night shift
Runnin' all day
Workin' all night
Money tight
Not a dollar to spend, would you do it again?
(I would, I would)
Because I was pushin' through that night shift
Runnin' all day
Workin' all night
Over-time
For a dollar to spend, just to do it again!
(I would, I would, I would)

[Verse 2]
Deep waters conceal the darkest of truths
I've been around it since a youth
And even though I'll never truly understand it or break it down to the roots
I always navigate it honest and true
Oh you were lookin' for some dirt
Let me give your ass a spade look
Underminin' me has become as popular as Facebook
I turn another page
You keep givin' me the same look
Actin' like I shouldn't catch my compliments and pain with the same hook
I'm climbin'
I don't need to put it all behind me
The past is underneath me
I ditch the anchor and fly free
The simple flash of a moment tryin' to blind me is somethin' you'll learn is impossible to define me, so fuck it
This is not my first song and dance
This is not my resignation letter to the fans
This is something that you'll probably never understand
Until you learn to face your battles like a man, but you can't

[Hook]
If-if you were pushin' through that night shift
Runnin' all day
Workin' all night
Money tight
Not a dollar to spend, would you do it again?
(I would, I would)
Because I was pushin' through that night shift
Runnin' all day
Workin' all night
Over-time
For a dollar to spend, just to do it again!
(I would, I would, I would)
