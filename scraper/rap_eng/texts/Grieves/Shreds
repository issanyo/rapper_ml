I don't believe in cutting corners
Own it like a scar on the face
Stand tall whether taking the gold or in last place
Not really the one to give God praise
But if you got the gospel then tell me how it taste

Hallelujah

Biting on the bullet for strength
I'm a long distance runner sucker
I'm in it for length
It's not a matter of whether or not you can play
But a scale of if you give a fuck enough to make a statement

Lay it down

[Pre-Hook]
Separate the men from the mice
Another body under halogen lights missing its life
Wondering what the hell would make you think that
You could judge another person for loving something so much it hurts the stomach

Living by the blood in my neck
With a bullseye tatted on the back of my head
I never spoke it how they wanted it to be said
So they left me for the winter and the wolves

[Hook]
Tear me into shreds
Rip me into bits
Tear another page out
Punch me in the ribs
I can smell the poison on your lips
Whatever it is I'd be willing to bet
They want to get inside my head

Tell me how it is
Sitting in a tower with a rifle and a list
I can see the razor on your lips
Whatever it is I'd be willing to bet
You should have held your breath

I don't believe in sitting down
Take it like a knife in the back
You burnt out into nothing after striking the match
I've never been the type to follow the pack
So if it's true you got the answers
Then why the hell you so mad then?

Another holy ghost laid script
Clipped the wings off of my words
And buried the shiv
They want to pick apart the passion in my ribs
I invite them
Cause I don't run away from shit

Lay it out

[Bridge]
Separate the guns and the flowers
The minutes that go into all these hours
And I bet if you were given a smidgen of just the tip of the ice berg
I've had to struggle with you
Wouldn't act so sour, maybe not

Livin off the fruit of my stress
With a size twelve boot heel stepping on my chest
Didn't do it how they wanted it to end
So they threw me to the winter and wolves

[Hook]
Tear me into shreds
Rip me into bits
Tear another page out
Punch me in the ribs
I can smell the poison on your lips
Whatever it is I'd be willing to bet
They want to get inside my head

Tell me how it is
Sitting in a tower with a rifle and a list
I can see the razor on your lips
Whatever it is I'd be willing to bet
You should have held your breath

[Hook]
Tear me into shreds
Rip me into bits
Tear another page out
Punch me in the ribs
I can smell the poison on your lips
Whatever it is I'd be willing to bet
They want to get inside my head

Tell me how it is
Sitting in a tower with a rifle and a list
I can see the razor on your lips
Whatever it is I'd be willing to bet
You should have held your breath
