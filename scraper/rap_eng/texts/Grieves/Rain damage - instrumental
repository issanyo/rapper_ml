Molded out of brimstone, learn to take a lashing on the coals
Hot metal pressing on the skin of my goals
I've been walking the plank of it, blindfolded, and know what it's like when the knife's out of the holster
Truth - that's the only reason I'm still alive
Crow's nest, throwing hope into broken sky, no time left to put it on the line
So if anybody asks just tell them I died trying
The gapped-tooth rapper is back, with a bag full of "I-don't-give-a-fuck" for that ass, Rhymesayers, put the logo on the back
If ever you were looking now you knew where I'm at
Name's Benjamin, same as I've ever been
Slipping on a glass full of ice-cold Templeton, cloud city, on the brim, running with my back against the wind
Rain Damage, Found me in the midnight
Walking in the downpour, with that look in my eyes
Filed to a point, allergic to the cousin of death
Up writing with the kick drum stuck in my chest
I've been about it, you can smell it on my breath
There's a fire that's inside of me ready to be set, drive
That's the reason for the fight in me, clock tower
10 Zero 4 lightning, must be something in the blood and the bones
That got me running out risking it all when you won't
The love song rapper is back, with a bus full of mail-riddled baseball bats, B
Lewis put a beatin' on the track, let a 'Sayer got H.A.M. like a bit of babe's ass
Name's Benjamin, same as I've ever been
Common to your town with some dirty rotten gentlemen
Cloud city, rainwater 'till the grave
Sailing with my back against the wave
