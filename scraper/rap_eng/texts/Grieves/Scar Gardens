(Verse 1)

Lay another one to rest in the valley of my shadows opened up
Bury all my expectations for a semi-normal love
And with it burning in my palms, massaging into my blood
I try to fight away my urges "It's only gonna rope you up girl."
Hear me, I know my capabilities of breaking
In the only thing that saves you from the feelings of trust
Believe the angel on your shoulder when she comes
Cause your devil's so familiar, and mine will leave you flustered like...
You count your tears like experience
And me? Just another sunken dream trying to deal with it
Calmly, reacting to every situation since you called me
Head dug into my palms thinking she don't honestly want this
And it's obvious yeah the sorrow sets it off
Hypnotizing both of us into agreeing with the odds
But in the dark I got a chance to fight it off
Instead I sleep with the chaos that will wander down the same Path that I chose to walk on

(Chorus)

She said it took her all her life
She’s steady looking at me like
She caught a glimpse of something
"I am not your paradise, girl"
And with it in me
Its better to save your wishes
For the moment after sailing away
She said it took her all her life
She’s steady looking at me like
She caught a glimpse of something
"I am not your paradise, girl"
And with it in me
Its better to save your wishes
For the moment after sailing away
"I should have never even shown you"

(Verse 2)

What it’s like inside the world I keep a lock on
Purple-hearted scar garden harvesting my thoughts song
And with the chalk gone, the problem still exists
At least the outline of its death prevents another fatal kiss
But that's impossible neither one of us opted to be positive
Stared each other in the face, and screamed until we lost it
And the fire magnetically pulled both of us right on top of it
Until one of us surrendered to rejection of the opposite
And this is not a love song, I’m working out my problems
The love songs what caused them, now i’m stuck and trying to solve them
And its all forever tarnished From beginning to the end
You use my smile as an ashtray and inhale its ending scent
Let it go, please let it go this will kill you
Reinventing us is not a miracle we still do and
Just as certain as I speak it to you now
I know I’ll wake up on the left side on the other side of town

Listen!..

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

"I am not your paradise, Girl"
"You should have never even asked"
"I am not your paradise, Girl"
"I should have never even showed you"

Baby, I can't make this right now... (4x)

(Chorus)
