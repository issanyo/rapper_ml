[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I found the keys in the basket by the front door
That ain't a hiding spot pops, that's a bad choice
What you think, I would've walked right passed it
And never put my hands into that little black basket
I held them close so the metal wouldn't chime
I've been caught red-handed about a million times
But tonight smells different
There's something about the cloud covering
You ain't gonna hear me start it over loud thunder
The ground rumbled as I pulled it out the drive
Drove slow to the end of the block, turned on the lights
I felt guilty for a second but it passed
When I put it into second and gave it a little gas
Stronger than anticipated, I was just a kid
You never taught me how to turn and how to skid
I held it tight until my knuckles turned red
But eventually I drove it off the edge

[Hook]
Like father, Like child
Should of known how not to
Oh, Why bother? Why try?
All of my life, I've been watching you
Oh, Like mother, Like child
Should of known how not to
Oh, Why cover? Why cry?
All of my life I've been watching you

[Verse 2]
You left your baggage in the street
That ain't a hiding spot mama, I can still see it
What you think I would've stepped right over it
Instead of opening it, and hopes that you never noticing
I picked it up and brought it out to the garage
Picked the lock with a bobby pin and opened up the top
I guess I never really knew what I saw
Dug around a little bit and found some pictures of your mom
So I closed it back up and I slid it under my bed
Shoved it to the back where I could easily forget it
Years passed and I don't think I ever thought of it
It wasn't something that I thought I would be haunted with
It's just a box what's the reason for the lock
Why's it childhood the only thing that you don't want to talk about
I guess I'll answer for myself when I'm grown
And lock a couple boxes of my own

[Hook]
Like father, Like child
Should of known how not to
Oh, Why bother? Why try?
All of my life, I've been watching you
Oh, Like mother, Like child
Should of known how not to
Oh, Why cover? Why cry?
All of my life I've been watching you

[Outro]
