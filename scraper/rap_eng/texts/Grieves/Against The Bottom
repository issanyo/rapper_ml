[Chorus]

Tell me with your back against the bottom
There's somethin' 'bout these days that got you caught up
Toss another empty bottle to the bay
What did you say, what did you do
When life came crashing down on you?

[Verse 1: iamTidus_]

I should have seen it in the past; the past never worked, why would it?
Can’t never could, and I can’t, so I couldn’t
Shrug my shoulders to the crown of my head
I’m better off dead, and the proof is in the pudding
Now I laugh, but deep down inside it’s dark
A black typhoon is swirling around my heart
The temperature is cold where you last left your mark
And the storm amplified to a flood and you’re a shark
In the water, and damn I’m the current
Flowing like a river or a preacher in a sermon
Sitting with a drink and a pen and a bee
Who notified a friend of a pregnancy
But hell, I’m getting off topic
I tried to keep my brain on tight, but I lost it
A smile in my face, a hop in my step
A lie is left, hoping I’ll retake your breath

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Joey.]

I still love you and it hurts the most
Really, it just hurts to know that I be feeling down like a contestant who was first to go
Back home, and now they’re mad and thinking everything is personal
And never seem to get that somebody has the worst in you
Do I matter? Are you aware of me?
You not caring about my life is a sight that I’m scared to see
I know I’ll take the loss if it’s a test of popularity
Get you paper hearts then watch you tear a piece
And toss it, did you know that you were tearing me?
Of course you don’t, it’s not apparent see, apparently
My back’s against the bottom, in too deep
Lack of oxygen, I can’t really breathe
Get my head straight, what do I really need?
I’m working on the answer, solving for why?
I think you carry the two, and divide it by pi
I don’t know, I get it all confused
I never ask for help so I don’t know what I’m to do
I tried to lighten up, but I get stuck up in it’s hue
Everything has changed now, man, I got a different view
And I let it fall in place, it always happens on my cue
And not everybody wins, man, somebody gotta lose

[Chorus]
