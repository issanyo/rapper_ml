[Verse 1]
I know I'm a complicated man in ways
I've been swimmin' far from shore
You kept fallin' for me through my darkest days
God bless that beautiful light that you forged
Life was cold and full of frozen-over lakes
You brought me closer to the flame
Now I close my eyes and all I see is your face
I'm like 5,000 miles away
You're on my mind all day
I don't know what else to say

[Hook]
Oh, I love you
I love you just to death
Oh, I love you
I love you just to death
Oh I do, yes I love you

[Verse 2]
There's a comfort in the color of yo' eyes
I've spent hours gettin' lost
Life keeps spinnin' 'round in circles like a fly
But you keep me grounded no matter the cost
I can't sleep the same without you by my side
Nights are longer when you're gone
I don't feel like I'm at home without your smile
Oh, there's 5,000 miles of sky
I'd cross it all and die happy
If I could just say

[Hook]
Oh, I love you
I love you just to death
Oh, I love you
I love you just to death
Oh I do, yes I love you
