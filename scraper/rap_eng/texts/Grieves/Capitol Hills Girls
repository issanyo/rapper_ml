They all look the same

Capitol Hill boys that look like Capitol Hill girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like Capitol Hill boys

You came home like you were not there
You were not not there
I do not like that sort of thing, not at all
Not at all

Capitol Hill boys that look like Capitol Hill girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like Capitol Hill boys [x2]

You have long hair, and yours is short
But coke is what both of you snort
Your pants are loose, your pants are tight
You both don't eat, and you're both white!

But I can't tell you apart
No, I can't tell you apart

Capitol Hill boys that look like Capitol Hill girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like Capitol Hill boys [x2]

Are you Amy, or David, or Jamie
Or Seamus, or Lacy, or Hazel, or all of the above?

And I can't tell you apart
No, I can't tell you apart

Are you Amy, or David, or Jamie
Or Seamus, or Lacy, or Hazel, or all of the above?

And I can't tell you apart
No, I can't tell you apart

Capitol Hill boys that look like Capitol Hill girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like Capitol Hill boys [x2]

I love them all

Capitol Hill boys that look like girls
Capitol Hill girls that look like boys

The Mexicans call a potato a papa
But you can call me a potata [x2]
Because I'm a potata!
