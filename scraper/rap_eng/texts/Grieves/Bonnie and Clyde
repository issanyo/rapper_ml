[Verse 1]
I was thinkin' 'bout gettin' lost
Taking this thing outside the city
You and I, against the odds
My Bonnie, your Clyde
Oh God, I'll ride anywhere that you want it to go
Girl, I'll put it in the GPS
Gun on my side
Anybody that gave you a problem
I'll put a bullet-hole in they chest
Get it, get in, baby you's a kitten
Wanna get you home put your booty on the kitchen table
If you willing', able, I can swing through
Put some ponies in the stable, we ride
Anyway that you want it to go
Girl I'll put it on that GPS
Sun on the rise, anybody that gave you a problem
I'll put a kitchen knife in they neck, baby

[Chorus]
You the type of girl that makes me wanna go
"Slow down, wait a minute"
You and I should steal a car and hit the road, load out
We're like Bonnie and Clyde
A bag full of money in the trunk, girl, partners in crime
Whenever you want girl, i'm ready to die (for ya)
In and out of lanes, on the run, heading south on the five
Just like Bonnie and Clyde

[Verse 2]
I was thinkin' 'bout gettin' rich
And takin' this thing down to California
You and I, in the whip
My Mallory, you're Mickey
The love of my life
Anything that you wanted to get girl
You ain't even gots to ask
Run in the night, anybody that wanted to stop us
I put some buck shot in they ass, test me now

[Chorus]
You the type of girl that makes me wanna go
"Slow down, wait a minute"
You and I should steal a car and hit the road, load out
We're like Bonnie and Clyde
A bag full of money in the trunk, girl, partners in crime
Whenever you want girl, i'm ready to die (for ya)
In and out of lanes, on the run, heading south on the five
Just like Bonnie and Clyde

[Interlude]
Now wait a minute, you know I love the shit out of you baby
Come on

[Verse 3]
I was thinking 'bout weddin' rings
And shootin' all the way, straight across the border
You and I, ain't a better thing
They tell us we're crazy, but they don't know what it's like
Anytime that you wanted it, baby, I put it on you just like that
Loving you right, anybody that look at you funny
I'd hit em with a baseball bat, and that's the truth

[Chorus]
You the type of girl that makes me wanna go
"Slow down, wait a minute"
You and I should steal a car and hit the road, load out
We're like Bonnie and Clyde
A bag full of money in the trunk, girl, partners in crime
Whenever you want girl, i'm ready to die (for ya)
In and out of lanes, on the run, heading south on the five
Just like Bonnie and Clyde
