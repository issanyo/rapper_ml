[Intro]

[Verse 1: Grieves]
I guess I'm sick of feeling like I oughta
Pack my bags and go
It's all i've ever known
It's all that keeps me focused
It's all I've ever needed
Was someone to believe in me
When the stars fell outta my skies it wasn't you
And I wish that you could be that one for me but baby it ain't right
That we would fuss and fight until the day turned into night
But still you call me up and tell me how you want to do me just one more time
But I've walked the line and though I'm fine out here alone

[Hook]
It's all my fault then why
You keep calling me up
I keep wondering if it's even worth the trouble we go through
To try to prove
Oh you're gonna be the death of me
Uh huh yeah you're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
You're gonna be the death of me

[Verse 2: Grieves]
I guess I'm sick of feeling like I gotsta
Take one on the chin
Fake your silly whim
Oh it kills me you never notice
Cause all you ever wanted
Was someone to be a part of
Those silly little games you play it wasn't me
And I bet you think if you snap your little fingers I wil run right back to you
But honey that ain't true and it has to prove itself tonight
And if you dont get the simple fact that you and I ain't good together lady you ain't grown
And it's gonna be cold out in that big ol' world alone

[Hook]
It's all my fault then why
You keep calling me up
I keep wondering if it's even worth the trouble we go through
To try to prove
Oh you're gonna be the death of me
Uh huh yeah you're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
You're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
You're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
You're gonna be the death of me
Death of me
