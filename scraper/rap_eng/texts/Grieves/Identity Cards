[Verse 1: Grieves]
I spent a lot of time looking at the ground
With my hands out in front of me, and head in the clouds
It ain't typical, it's cool, I ain't your typical man
I'm living the way I wanna, and doing the best I can
Plus, alot of people wanna break out the nooses/
Pull down the sun and charge everybody to use it
But I've decided I'mma keep to myself
Plus I never needed a reason to be anything else/
I mean look at me, I ain't covered in gems
I don't know what hyphey means dude, and neither do my friends
I don't go to the club, I don't fight for fun
Shit I'm almost 25 and I ain't ever shot a gun
But I do like drinking, and shopping on the internet
And trying to get Lucky to jump me into the Living Legends
So you can take it the way that you wanna see it
And say what ever you want cause I'm never gunna believe it

[Hook: Grieves]
Out of sight out of mind these days
Call me two sheets into the wind
They wanna tell me how to walk
Wanna tell me how to talk
Wanna tell me how to live
(I like the way that I live)

Out of sight out of mind these days
I'm fucked up and fine with it all
They wanna tell me how to live
Wanna tell me how to die
Wanna tell me how to rise
Wanna tell me how to fall

[Verse 2: Lucky]
I attack these breaks, take a moment for reflection
Lucky is a problem, probably need an intervention
So I'm thinking I should mention
See the obvious I'm gifted
Like presents under trees on December 25th is
Surprise I'mma fly dude
My rhyming gets a little denied when I'mma high dude
So I'mma take a hit of this pride and try to find you
I'mma stay committed to drive so I'mma shine true
Im conflicted with inner demons
Ganging up on all of my good
I got a feeling it's wrong
But if your right
Ignorance is bliss right
Lately i've been thinking a change could make a good life
Perahps for that I laugh and rap
And manage to roam and tap ass
Alas I'm bad I'm touring I'm phat
Consider this a word from the bitter
Bullshitter, yo

They wanna tell me how to live

[Verse 3: Grieves]
Hi my name is Ben, and I'm afraid of the Apocalypse
Murder Dice told me what it was and I lost my shit
People tell me that I'm easily influenced
I wear wet laundry and I'm skinny as a toothpick
I'm pretty into music but I dance like shit
And every bartender that i've encountered thinks that I'm a kid
So bouncers don't like me cause I look 16
But make a damn fine living off a good 16

[Verse 4: Lucky]
A good 16 is what im known for
But a great 19 is my thing on tour
Lead her up on my bus best believe I score
Lucky Lust, Lucky Bust, Lucky...He's a whore
He's a poor role model for sure
But he can't trust his own guts no more
But he gets stuck them mistakes ain't learned
Probably chase them sluts till the day I get burned
Yo
