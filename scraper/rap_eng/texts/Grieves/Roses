[Verse 1: Grieves]
Money talks
Bullets sing and the city moans
I watched the pressure turn a man into a pile of bones and eat him
Hard to believe that I used to humor it
God became a box that I put my treacherous future in
Threw it all away
Some part of me is still in it
Swimming in dark waters that swallow a man's vision
They turn us into collisions
Swerving off of the road
Show me one fuck given
I'll show you a dozen owed man
I saw your finger pointed at me from the roof
Want to feel a little closer come and wrestle with the truth
Shit
I was told that I wouldn't ever be you so they pumped me full of drugs to make a version they could use
Then they wonder why I used
Yeah they wonder
Tell me what would you expect when they poison us at the roots
No help just a whole bunch of "told you so's" but I've survived because in the dirt is where the roses grow

[Hook: Grieves]
Now I'm stronger than I've ever been
It was raining outside they wouldn't let us in
Showered down got soaked to the bone
But in the morning I was surrounded by roses

[Chrous: Davey Jones]
Roses came from a seed
These roses grown in the city
Roses thrown at my feet
These roses surrounded me

[Verse 2: Fearce Vill]
When we were down
Nobody ever gave a shit
Just a couple of food stamps and a waiting list
Momma checking her savings
But we ain't making it
Single lady with baby's the 80's made me this
It doesn't phase me but lately I've been crazy as shit
Admit you hate me
Because this faking not helping a bit
Not lazy but they haven't paid me or gave me a tip
My heart is vacant
It's aching and breaking to bits
If my skin started fading I can pay some rent
My mind is racing
Got me facing the pavement and bricks
Changing pages but they booked me for raising my kid
I'm sorry but this lifestyle got me chasing the chips
No handouts
I'd rather prove myself until I bring your inner fan out
Then you'll understand what these thoughts in my heads about
Fuck standing out
Put my voice in the speakers
And you can see it's panning out

[Hook: Grieves]
Now I'm stronger than I've ever been
It was raining outside they wouldn't let us in
Showered down got soaked to the bone
But in the morning I was surrounded by roses

[Chrous: Davey Jones]
Roses came from a seed
These roses grown in the city
Roses thrown at my feet
These roses surrounded me
