[Verse 1]
You said you'd never call again
But I can hear your knuckle bones cracking on my door
I said I'd never fall again (fall again)
But here I am looking up at you from the floor
The crazy that you got is just the kind that I'm addicted to
It makes me feel like killing you
I think about it now and then
I remember what I use the drugs for

[Hook]
I think about you and say fuck you
Then you come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)
You think about me and say fuck you
Then I come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)

[Verse 2]
Ah, turning it up, fading it out
I ain't got nothing to say
You keep on coming around, breaking me down
Making me feel like I'm crazy
Girl, you're fucking amazing, but you fucking enrage me
You bite on your lip with your hand on you neck like it's something you're craving, but

[Bridge]
You're like a drug, getting me drunk, nobody's calling this love
I'm like your stone, sinking alone, you keep on digging me up
I should be hating your guts
Hating your guts
Instead I'm up in your guts

[Hook]
I think about you and say fuck you
Then you come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)
You think about me and say fuck you
Then I come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)

[Verse 3]
I told my momma you were dead
So now I got the feeling that I'm talking to ghosts
Never getting out of bed
Fogging up the window when you wanted it most
The mixture of the poison in my blood has got me turning blue
It makes me wanna murder you
Aye, aye, aye
I think about it now and then
I remember what I bought the gun for

[Hook]
I think about you and say fuck you
Then you come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)
You think about me and say fuck you
Then I come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)

[Verse 4]
Aye, falling apart, under the rug
I don't have any restraint
You keep on calling me up, wearing me out
I keep on doing the same
Girl, you're fucking amazing, but you're fucking insane though
And you sweat through the sheets and the neighbors are pissed from you yelling my name out

[Bridge]
You're like a drug, getting me drunk, nobody's calling this love
I'm like your stone, sinking alone, you keep on digging me up
I should be hating your guts
Hating your guts
Instead I'm up in your guts

[Hook]
I think about you and say fuck you
Then you come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)
You think about me and say fuck you
Then I come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)
I think about you and say fuck you
Then you come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)
You think about me and say fuck you
Then I come over and I (fuck you, fuck you)
