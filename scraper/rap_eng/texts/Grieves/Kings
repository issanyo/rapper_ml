[Verse I]
I drink the cloudy city rainwater
You can never save my soul
Painted glass on my stomach and I don't break it for no one, go
Your blood runs like a river when your back's turned
And hope don't float when it's choking on its last words
Word, which one would you use to describe this
I'm sick of fighting everyone around me for silence
Sick of trying to get by inside of your silly blinded
Vision of what you though life was before you dived in
Take a look at me I'm picking through my last meal
Heading to the gallows with a smile on my cracked grill and
That's real, you can keep your little rap deals
Cause I don't give a damn about being king of any crap hill
Stop, and let it fall where the chips land
And take the earth from underneath your fragile pride and kick stand, so
When it all clears and the rain clouds fade you can sleep with the rest of the skeletons in their grave

[Bridge]
This city,(yeah) it's really got a hold on you
This city,(yeah) it's really got a hold on you

[Hook]
You don't need to fight me off I'm well on my way
Gonna leave these cobblestones and matchsticks in the back of my brain
I learned that you don't have a single word left that you can say
Better make me quiver when you wave it like a knife in my face
Your king is dead

[Verse II]
You can cherish these bricks all day
But not a single one will ever get you outta here and take you away
You want a throne that can never be claimed
But standing there looking like another drone that lost his way
So take the broken crown off
Bowing in a kingdom full of fools gold
Searching for a diamond in a pile full of bruised hopes
You're looking at me through those tiny little two holes
That lie to you and force you to be blinded when the truth shows
Yeah, I guess I'm nothing but a blood drop
That fell out of your last black listed number one spot
Coagulate me, I'm ready to be released and
Outta your palms like the burgundy powdered breeze, how poetic
You all want change but won't let it
Get a breath of any answer till you decided it was ready to breathe
Believe me, that's the nature of the beast
Break his little legs and watch it try to flee
Watch it hobble out your awful line of reach
Turn around and pull the cotton out it's mouth and pour it's heart out in the streets
And when all of this is over
You can sharpen up your teeth just to smile in the mirror while the rest of you depletes

[Bridge]
This city,(yeah) it's really got a hold on you
This city,(yeah) it really ate a hole through you

[Hook]
You don't need to fight me off I'm well on my way
Gonna leave these cobblestones and matchsticks in the back of my brain
I learned that you don't have a single word left that you can say
Better make me quiver when you wave it like a knife in my face
Your king is dead
