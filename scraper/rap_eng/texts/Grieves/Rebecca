[Verse 1: Grieves]
It's been awhile since I spoke like a human
Haven't seen you in over half a decade
And haven't talked since I moved
And the home town harmonies telling me you've been bad
Grieving over the fact that you're losing your baby's dad
But it's not just that, you're farther into the crack
Heard you're walking a track and marching into the trash
Fuck praying, cause I've been silent for years
I'm sick of trying to be a man about it; hiding my tears
And fuck the judgment, I've got a messed up past
But when asked and confronted, I'mma shut down fast
And the truth is, girl I cry when I think of you
And write a million songs that I'mma never get to sing with you
Talk about the places I'mma never get to bring you to
Show you what it's like to build a life and learn a thing or two
What hurts me is that I love you, cause you're my older sister
And the girl that I grew up with, c'mon

[Verse 2: Grieves]
Mom's shuts down when I ask and dad's so sad
That I don't know if he's ever gonna get past it
And really (hi dad), I'm finding it hard for me to manage
Any close relationships without the fear of vanishing
All of this has been hard, I ain't denying it
I'm writing down this song as a product of my environment
But listen, they say that family is everything
It's more than just a house, two dogs and a wedding ring
It's blossoming life and standing up to anything
Trying to take the people that you love from what it's meant to be
Yeah, so then where'd you go?
Prisoner in your body quarantined from your soul
And I know those drugs got you out in the cold
Got you spitting in the mouth of those showing you hope
So, if you'd ever come through to your senses
I'll be right here, waiting for Rebecca
