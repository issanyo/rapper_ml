[Verse 1: Grieves]
I swear to god that sometimes
I feel my life is going blind
From the women I wake up to
To the substance in my rhymes
And I've abused the truth by telling myself everythings fine
With all that negativity I'm ignoring, steadily climbing
And undescribed
But hell I know that im not perfect
God knows I can't keep a girlfriend
Cause all of my problems surface
They feel I dont deserve 'em
Cause their friends say that im worthless
Unappropriately portrayed in my words
And put about my music
Haven't been making it lately the way that I view haven't been positive
Missing the fact that it's human to get confused
I bleed and bruise like all the rest of you
But verbalize my blood inhale the punches love has thrown at me
And breathe it out my lungs like
And this all has been a mess
I replaced the things I love and ripped my heart out of my chest like
And im not so concerned with why
I'm just here to count the minutes till tomorrows sun can rise
Listen..

[Hook: Grieves]
How many times do you have to wake up to stop dreaming
And I wrap my love notes in dust but never read 'em
Many times I just try to give up to stop leaving you
I have my heart broke and busted
Most of its been crushed but I blame it on myself

[Verse 2: Grieves]
Cause in the morning I don't see the right reflection
That foggy mirror after my shower, I see rejection
And I'm not saying im depressed
Seems to be a common theme today
These children try to hate themselves
But dont know why they feel that way
I got a real path paved and its been crazy
In a month I almost had the clap and possibly a baby
Relocated places credit companies chasing me
And new age taking on in it's efficient pile of changes
And I hate it cause its all so uncontrollable
Losing myself inside this broken emotion of no one knows
What's the point of ever falling in love
I find it's more about the pain than it ever was about trust
Find its more about breaking chains and being confound there that it rusts
Found that love is just a test to most of us who've given up
But if you think of it logistically
Then love is open eye
Cause its everywhere you look
And its in every scar you hide

[Hook: Grieves]
How many times do you have to wake up to stop dreaming
And I wrap my love notes in dust but never read 'em
Many times I just try to give up to stop leaving you
I have my heart broke and busted
Most of its been crushed but I blame it on myself
