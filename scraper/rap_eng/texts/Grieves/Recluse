Yeah, I pushed the boat out - I'm floating on faith
Got a I-don't-give-a-shit look stuck on my face
I guess that I've become a product of the castle gates
Dug a moat around my heart and filled it up with paint
I went and poured it on the rocks with my last album
So thick that a normal person would pass out from
Now something of which I used to confide in
Got me sittin in silence, propping open my eyelids
Stupid - I just want to listen to the music
Fade in to the background and drink until the rooms spinnin'
So move some, there ain't nothing left to see here
The only words I'm a pay attention to are "free beer"
So leave me here like a cricket in a matchbox
Cash in my good luck and spend it on a padlock
The bad thoughts and the whiskey are better company than bullshit
So just leave it and go

I don't want to go outside today
No, I want to be left alone
I don't want to put the mask on my face
No, I want to be left alone
I don't want to get up out my bed
I want to be left alone
Didn't hear a goddamn word you said
Go home

I hit the still water; coasting on hope
Got a bunch of little daggers tattooed on my throat - (ouch)
What's the point of making friends when you grew up
With a devil and couple of pretend ones
I guess that I don't know the difference when it comes to space
You're either leaving me alone or all up in my face
And lately, with the way that things are going
I don't taste the sugar in your words for me to give a shit about what you say
Yup - I'm crazy and irrational
Always tell the truth so that you can call me "asshole"
I prefer the black hole over the sun
Plant a seed up in the sound garden; watered with rum
It's not the same when you're looking through the frame of a broken heart
The smoke blinds but also helps you look the part
So you can knock it 'til your knuckles get scars
I suggest you leave it and go

I don't want to go outside today
No, I want to be left alone
I don't want to put the mask on my face
No, I want to be left alone
I don't want to get up out my bed
I want to be left alone
Didn't hear a goddamn word you said
Go home
