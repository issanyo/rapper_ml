[Verse 1]
Where the hell have I gone to
Why's it got to be so motherfucking hard for me to call you?
Staying up late tryna to get it all straight
Every minute I've wasted
You were probably thinking I didn't want to
That ain't the case
15 years and that ain't the case
Bad as it tastes
I'm the one to blame for putting up all the walls and demanding the space
And I just can't take it these days, so far out
Want to bring it home, but I don't know how (how?)
Yeah, man I don't know how
Family could be something I don't know 'bout
And I pushed you that far 'cause I got scared
Would've been hell but I could've said prayers
Should've been there and it's not okay that your name is one thing I don't know how to say

[Hook]
Faded
Looking for the words that I could use to get to you
Don't know how to say it
Faded
Hopefully it's gettin' through
'Cause everything is faded
Lookin' for the words, ayy
And I don't know how to say it
Faded
Hopefully it's gettin' through
Because everything is faded

[Verse 2]
Where the hell did you go to
Why'd you make it so motherfuckin' impossible to go through?
Runnin' on fumes
Trying to follow your tune
We were runnin' around in circles
To the point that it was dangerous to know you
I could've reached out
15 years and I should've reached out
But I couldn't find the person I was looking for
Even if I did I was scared that you would have been underneath in the ground
And I ran from that, ran from that
Too damn scared to take a chance with that
So the bags got packed, blood got cold, names got changed and your kids got grown, grown
Lookin' at the phone with a broken heart
Tryna to keep a piece of what fell apart
Dark night and it's not okay that your names one thing that I don't know how to say

[Hook]
Faded
Looking for the words that I could use to get to you
Don't know how to say it
Faded
Hopefully it's gettin' through
'Cause everything is faded
Lookin' for the words, ayy
And I don't know how to say it
Faded
Hopefully it's gettin' through
Because everything is faded
