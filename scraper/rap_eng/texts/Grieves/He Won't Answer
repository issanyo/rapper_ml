[Verse 1]
Another night in this black water rain cloud
Kicking through the puddles on his way up to the Greyhound and
In his pocket is a letter from his mother, folded up saying...
(Where have you been?)
Yeah, but he won't write back
Left his whole life on the nightstand
Open up his wounds and let em bleed onto the white sand
And you can label him another problem typecast
And stay the hell away from him like everybody else has
And that's exactly why he flees to the road
Another notch in the war club he keeps in his soul
And if you ever saw him swing it you would easily know
And have the worried urge to ask him
(Where have you been?)
Yeah, but he won't answer
Blinking as the headlights pass him
Rip the chills off of his spine and throw them right at you
But sometimes you don't really get what ask for
And life gets so cold and you can never go back home

[Hook]
Where would you go if could never go home? (go home)
What would you say if they never even asked you? (asked you)
Where would you go if could never go home? (go home)
What would you say if they never even asked you? (asked you)
Where would you go if could never go home? (go home)
What would you say if they never even asked you? (asked you)
Where would you go if could never go home? (go home)
What would you say if they never even asked you?

[Verse 2]
The sun rises on a dead open one way
And dilates his pupils like a fire struck his young face
Dead to the world, he's planning his exit to stare death in the face
(Where have you been?)
Yeah, but he won't fold
He's been waiting for the end of the road
To have this cold world drop off and swallow him whole
It's a one way trip, he don't plan to return
And as the vessel of his escape out eases into the terminal
Lost, with nothing but a smirk on his face
As he steps off the bus and starts picking up pace and
You could see it in the people as he ran past that everyone was wondering
(Where have you been?)
He's almost home, and he can feel it in the cracks of his bones
As he runs up the stairs that pass over the road and
Without a hesitation stopping his actions
He leaps from the guardrail and dives into traffic

[Hook]

[Outro]
Daddy was a rolling stone
Mama never gave two shits about a broken home
I said Daddy was a rolling stone
Mama never gave two shits about a broken home
(Where have you been?)
I said daddy was a rolling stone
Mama never gave two shits about a broken home
I said Daddy was a rolling stone
Mama never gave two shits
