Born blond in the winter with an empty head
The snow covered up the Camry, the whole house slept
Drawing pictures in the bed
Waking up and racing down the stairs, trying to catch my breath
Was so simple; Superman, trick or treat, wet socks
Bike rides in the summer to the best spots
Coulda sworn I was king of the best odds
Runnin round with the dogs in the back yard
Growin never knowin what the past done
Livin life like the mystery, a packed lunch
Getting whooped in the playground, scratched up
Comin home after school on the last bus
Back then it was all about laughs
Hit the corner store for the new Fleer packs
Mine was a religion and happiness was a fact
It's a shame how the time goes past

Movin so fast

It's like I'm movin at lightspeed
Slow down
You need to slow down
Every once in a while sometimes
You'll see how the world goes round
You need to slow down every once in a while
Cause you don't know, you don't
No, you don't need to go so fast

Things changed in the pop shop got an offer
Packed up moved out down to Colorado
Sunshine clean air not a lot of problems
And that's when I discovered pogs and tamagachi
Time past and the friends found punk yah
Oh whatever man a lot of it was junk
But we loved it made us feel cool little dumb kids
Runnin round just for fun doin dumb shit
I was lightin all my candles on both ends
Warren lake getting drunk with the friends
I was tryin to stay positive even though I pretended it
It helped cause at home I was lackin a happy ending
For all, saw a lot of tall trees fall
In the name of an addiction my sister taught me to follow
I cracked, cleaned up and got the bags packed
And swore that I would never go back

Movin' so fast

It's like I'm movin' at lightspeed
Slow down
You need to slow down
Every once in a while sometimes
You'll see how the world goes round
You need to slow down every once in a while
Cause you don't know, you don't
No, you don't need to go so fast

Eighteen I decided I was done with it
Hit Seattle with a head full of drum rhythms
Falling in and out of love with these young women
Thinkin they could make a change of the blood given
Nah, I was too young too face it
Workin two jobs still thinking I could make it
Local all star still singin from his basement
Finally got a shot and I've been workin every day since
Found love in a city where the angels fly
Put a record out with Josh One made out clime
Came home after two years and playin out rhymes
Just to find my little angel was no more mine
Parted ways with a friend was not easy
Made a leap to the future it got queasy
Started workin on the things that had lost reason
Now I'm sittin with a pad

Movin so fast

It's like I'm movin' at lightspeed
Slow down
You need to slow down
Every once in a while sometimes
You'll see how the world goes round
You need to slow down every once in a while
Cause you don't know, you don't
No, you don't need to go so fast
