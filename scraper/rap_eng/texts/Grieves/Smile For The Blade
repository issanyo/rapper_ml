[Hook]
Smile for the blade
Everybody's watching
Everybody always got something to say
They wanna pick you into pieces
Lie, make you believe this
Limit you from succeeding
And take away your faith
Smile for the blade
Everybody's talking
Everybody always got something to say
So no matter what it is
No matter what you do
There will always be a person trying to take it away

[Verse 1]
I've heard that I don't know the words that come out of my songs
Like I was gone when I wrote it
And didn't see the pen inside of my palms
Are you kidding
I understand that you have an opinion
But it's ludicrous to think that I'd simulate what I'm living
And it's pointless
Cause I'm not a person of arms
With the whole world screaming and ready to bring it on
No point
Cause I don't see the contest in art
I only embarked in this so I could depart and free parts of mind
And what did I find
Grown ass men acting like bitches fighting all of the time
God damn I'm sick of all this tryin'
To turn around and see a mouth full of nails
Hunting me, faking a smile
And I hate it
Cause I'm a fan of truth
And you motherfuckers lie to get by in this game full of fools
And it's useless
So you can chastise and blame me
But no matter what, you will never change me

[Hook]
Smile for the blade
Everybody's watching
Everybody always got something to say
They wanna pick you into pieces
Lie, make you believe this
Limit you from succeeding
And take away your faith
Smile for the blade
Everybody's talking
Everybody always got something to say
So no matter what it is
No matter what you do
There will always be a person trying to take it away

[Verse 2]
And everyone's an expert
When it comes down to my life
And speak like they knew me before I got in the limelight
And what the hell does that really mean
I busted ass to get these broken-hearted love poems printed up and seen
And I liked it
So why you bringing me down
You either trying to help me or bury me in the ground
As of lately
I'm feeling a little drowned in the negativity
Surrounding me making a sound
And you hate me for it
You gotta be out your mind
Thinking I would give a damn about the flaws that you find
Cause I'm human
And never had a problem with that
It's a shame that you think I would stop
Cause of that, say never
This is just a way to behold
The best way to gather around the flame - in the cold
So you can go ahead and chastise and blame me
But no matter what you will never change me

[Hook]
Smile for the blade

So no matter what it is
No matter what you do
