Like I'm,﻿ like I'm Ben E. King!

Take your guard off guard I ain't tryna treat you like it's garbage
So I'ma turn the bass up loud enough to make em want shit
Oh shit, can't you see that there'll never be blood
And I'll shake up your﻿ mother fuckin milkshake and drink it for fun
Put your hands up ain't nobody judgin put your hands up
You are now rocking with Big Chocolate, turn the jams up
Im﻿ a monster, I'm a motherfuckin monster, I'm a monster
I'm a motherfuckin -BOOM- I party harder than legend vicious and candy
And big bucks status on these mother fuckin bambis
Damn, now a days I hear the blah blah blah
And no ones happy till yo dancin make em ha ha ha
