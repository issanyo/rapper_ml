I'm on my 9 to 5 hustle and grind
Working on, working on, working on
Leaving this silly little life behind
Probably just til Monday comes
Cause when the weeks is done
I've been know to freak some fun
And it normally goes on
Until the morning light
Drunk and singing Journey songs
Up in my room

I'm so fly
Sliding on the wood in my socks
Working on, working on, working on
Drinking this bottle of wine I got
Cause ain't no room for judgment here
Cause if anyone finds me
They'll probably say I'm high
But don't pay 'em never mind
Cause I'm doing fine
I just came to party like, party like, party like, party
Like I'm out of my mind

I can watch my Star Wars box set twice
Working on, working on, working on
Trying to beat my Donky Kong score for life
That ain't easy to do, girl
Cause once the party's started
I'm known to get retarded
And blast Jefferson Starship
And get it right
Drunk, making dance moves up in my room

I can jump all the way over my couch
Working on, working on, working on
Getting my high notes right out loud
A karaoke master at night
And if anyone saw me
They'd probably feel awkward
Cause I'd be in a GWAR suit
And loving life
Cause I just came to party like, party like...
I'm out of my mind
