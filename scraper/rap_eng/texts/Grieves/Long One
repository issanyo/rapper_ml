Woke up, broke down
Boss callin' me tellin me I'm a clown, see
I couldn't hold a conversation let alone a job
So I should come and get my shit before they throw it out
Typical, I guess the clouds came back for me
Couldn't run from the spell that's been cast on me
Last time I got surrounded by gloom I was Lieutenant Dan drunk, screamin' at the moon sayin'
Fuck it, let the lines be crossed
Let's climb up on the roof and toss knives at God
I don't need a mindless job I'm fine without it
You can keep your nine to five and your high-rise trousers
I got the fifth of bourbon on deck
A contact list, full of homies in debt
So when life deals you nothin' but jokers and holds tens
We get drunk off that severance check, man
It's gonna be a long one

It's gonna be a lone one, ay, It's gonna be a long one, oh
Drinkin' til the sun comes up, and I said
It's gonna be a lone one, ay, It's gonna be a long one
(So grab a couple of brews and come on now)

Fell down, got up
Found love, got dumped
Cuz she don't need an unemployed punk runnin' round livin' life like the pile of blues records in his trunk
It's a damn shame, but I don't think I'm gonna miss her
She wants the dog, the house, to call me mister
Ironically now she calls me an asshole
Call me at her job from the craft store
Told me that I'm dealin' with a disease
I don't wanna succeed
Anybody that's ever tried to assist me gets it
I've become a product of the slump
Pig-headed stubborn ass loser of the month, yeah
Lost cause on a castle of his junk
Tryin' to sweep a mountain of fuck ups under the rug
Man I get it, all of this has pushed me to the limit
So now I'm gonna drink until I'm spinnin'
It's gonna be a long one

I'm gonna be up all night
It's gonna be a long one, yeah (x2)
I'm gonna be up all night
It's gonna be a long yeah, a long one yeah, a long long long long one
It's gonna be a long one, ay, It's gonna be a long one, oh
Drinkin' til the sun comes up, and I said
It's gonna be a lone one, ay, It's gonna be a long one
(So grab a couple of brews and come on now)
