[Intro]
Welcome everybody to R.S.E flight 352 with non-stop travel to wherever your fine ass decided to go today. Before we take off I, I'd like to go over a few safety procedures. So please make sure your seat is leaned back, your glass is full and your speakers are turned all the way up

[Verse 1]
I woke up in a city I can't even say the name of
People lookin' at me wonderin' where the fuck I came from
Had to catch a flight to 'em
Drank a couple whiskies in the air
Called my mama when I landed and told her not to be scared
I'm a rolling stone
Never really knowin' when I'm goin' home
Went and caught the itch and got the beat like it was Cortisone
I'm out here
You can go ahead and let them know
That the groove has to be slumped
And that bass has got to be low

[Hook]
This that shit that you can play in LA
From Chicago to Seattle, all the way to BK
Caught the A to JFK and had to hop on a plane
I'll send your ass a postcard, postcard
I'll send your ass a postcard, postcard
I'll send your ass a postcard, postcard
I'll send your ass a—uh, yo

[Verse 2]
I said, I woke up in a city I ain't never even been to
Called the homie Chords to see what shit we could get into
I had to jump a pond to them
Got my luggage searched when I arrived
Po-po thought that I was holding
Told them I don't have the time
I'm a vagabond
Bag is packed and loaded and the drank is strong
Watched the city disappear behind me like it's camouflaged
I'm out here
You can go ahead and say it loud
That snare has to be crisp
That ass has got to be round
That glass has got to be tipped
That lost gotta be found
That music's got to go up
Because this shit's about to go down
That glass has got to be tipped
That lost gotta be found
That music's got to go up
Because this shit's about to go down

[Hook]
This that shit that you can play in LA
From Chicago to Seattle, all the way to BK
Caught the A to JFK and had to hop on a plane
I'll send your ass a postcard, postcard
I'll send your ass a postcard, postcard
I'll send your ass a postcard, postcard
I'll send your ass a—you'll see

[Interlude]
I'll send you a post card, yeah
I was thinkin' of you (I was thinkin' of you)
Ooh, baby
Sensual curves come
That's true, that's true, that's true
Go and send it to 'em
Yeah, go and sent it to 'em
Yeah, go and sent it to 'em
(We gonna bring it back to the beginning on this one)

[Outro]
This that shit that you can play in LA
From Chicago to Seattle, all the way to BK
We gon' send it to 'em
Yeah, it's signed, sealed, delivered
I'm back in the buildin' like—
This that shit that you can play in LA
From Chicago to Seattle, all the way to BK
Go and send it to 'em, yeah
Ha-ha, woo
Feel fuckin' crazy, ha-ha-ha!
