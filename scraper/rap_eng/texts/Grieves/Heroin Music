*Heroin,Heroin*

*when you shot me at point blank range i knew you loved me*

[Verse 1: Grieves]
Windy streets have the fire inside their veins
And you act like you don't notice
And you can leave your candy covered life at home
The bottom the sea is over, hey, hey
And I won’t even stop to let you hold my broken hand so hold on, hey now
So wrap around my body like a ribbon
And expose its hidden rhythms, and prepare to take your dive

Oh yeah yeah, oh ho ho, yeah, mhmh
Oh yeah yeah yeah easy, oh ho ho, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah im speaking
Hey hey hmm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah im speaking hey hey hmm…

*have you profited from this record? We hope so*
