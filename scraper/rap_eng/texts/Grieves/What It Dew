[Verse 1]
Derelict flow runnin'
Motherfuckers always hating on som'n
Took a small break to fill up my plate 'cause all of this runnin' 'round got me hungry
Tell 'em I'm back, chillin' my glass
Ain't no need to be panicked
Soon as I knock this back, I'ma rock that ass like
—stop— (Goddamn!)
Skinny Bones Jones with immaculate flow
(Didn't even know that he could rap like that, though)
Yeah, well who's the asshole that told you I had to rap slow?
Point 'em out
I stepped into my future, blocked out that noise
And I came back with a vengeance
Like I'm Bruce Willis on 'roids
Tell me now, who's got that smooth shit
Sipping on some Laphroaig
And I walked out of that smoke cloud
With my game tight and on point

[Bridge]
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
I'm feelin' real fine (and a little drunk)
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
I'm feelin' real fine (and a lot drunk)
So if they ask about me

[Hook]
Ooh, tell 'em what I does, tell 'em what I do
Eeh, tell 'em where I is, tell 'em where I be
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
Tell 'em what I do
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
Tell 'em what I do, fuck you

[Interlude]
Man boys, it is colder than a witch's titty
Face-down in the snow in a brass bra, but this beat makes me feel like I'm tongue-fucking a margarita

[Verse 2]
Yo, keeping my cool runnin'
Everybody's always mad about somethin'
Figured if that's the way that it is
Then I ain't got time to worry about nothin'
Tell 'em I'm back and try to relax
You can go ahead and be honest, kid
This shit here has to run it back home like
—stop— (oh shit!)
Sippin' on a little bit of Templeton (what's the big deal about Templeton?)
Picture what it's like to get head on top of a pile of Benjamin's, it's like that (but better)
Walked out of that mic booth, hopped onto that stage
And I came back to go bat-shit on these jokers like I'm Bruce Wayne
Tell 'em now who got that smooth shit jumpin' off of my page
You talk like I've been listenin' but I'm too buzzed to be phased

[Bridge]
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
I'm feelin' real fine (and a little drunk)
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
I'm feelin' real fine (and a lot drunk)
So if they ask about me

[Hook]
Ooh, tell 'em what I does, tell 'em what I do
Eeh, tell 'em where I is, tell 'em where I be
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
Tell 'em what I do
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
Tell 'em what I do, fuck you
Ooh, tell 'em what I does, tell 'em what I do
Eeh, tell 'em where I is, tell 'em where I be
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
Tell 'em what I do
I'm feelin' real good right now, yeah
Tell 'em what I do, fuck you
