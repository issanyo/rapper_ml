I often wonder why we never made it home
And why it feels like all the effort that we gave was never noticed
The pressure kept on building up and closing in
And by the end, hell, I swear to god I couldn't swim
Like since when did all of this become so hard to walk around
I miss the music that influenced us to talk about it
We used to sit around for hours trying to find ourselves inside a song that made us want to stop and smell the flowers
For a second, just a single second's all I wanted
Now I feel like every star I use to find you with is falling out the sky
Now I can't even seem to find the time
And if I did, I doubt you'd even look me in my eyes like you used to
Everything we had is just a story now
And anyway I see it it's impossible to word it out
Word of mouth says you still leave the candle lit
Hoping that somebody will notice and hold your hand through this

It wasn't anybody's fault
From the moment I was leaving I could feel it in my veins
Thought that I was someone that won't forget your name
You begged me to not get on that train
You told me that I wouldn't come back the same
I couldn't help myself from the minute I was leaving
I could feel it in my veins
I begged you not to stand in the rain
I told you that the weather around here don't change
You couldn't help yourself from believing that I'm someone
That won't forget your name

Every now and then I pick the phone up
And dial in your number and stare at it for a moment
I never call, I never will, it's hard to focus
That's what we get for throwing love into the ocean
Tied, cutting ties stuck inside trying to make it out
I string it up write the line and try and lay down
If I could find the peace of mind to go and press rewind I'd do it in a second if I thought that I could stay around
For just a second, just a goddamn second
I would freeze the whole entire world in place if it let me
You always told me I was gonna make a difference
I just never thought it'd be the kind that'd eventually split us
And I'm sorry, I never meant to leave you all alone
And have you living life with a person over the phone
The folks from back home say you still leave the lantern lit
Hoping that somebody will notice and help you manage this

It wasn't anybody's fault
From the moment I was leaving I could feel it in my veins
Thought that I was someone that won't forget your name
You begged me to not get on that train
You told me that I wouldn't come back the same
I couldn't help myself from the minute I was leaving
I could feel it in my veins
I begged you not to stand in the rain
I told you that the weather around here don't change
You couldn't help yourself from believing that I'm someone
That won't forget your name

You begged me to not get on that train

I couldn't help myself from the minute I was leaving

You couldn't help yourself from believing that I'm someone
That won't forget your name
