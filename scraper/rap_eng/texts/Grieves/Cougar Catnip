[Verse I]
Back when I was nothing
You probably would've walked on by
You probably would've walked on by
Now you out here fronting
All up in my face and I don't know why
I don't even know why you talk to me girl

Oooo if I was Mystikal
I would tell you to watch yourself
Oooo if I was Juvenile
I would tell you to back that ass up well
Go and play your tricks on someone else girl
Baby when you talk to me
I don't get the sincerest impression that you're giving a damn
Oh no now
You way too frickin hot for me
Which makes me think you believe I'm different than I actually am

If I was DJ Quik
I'd say that I don't wanna party with you at all
If I was Ludacris
I'd probably tell your crazy ass to move
Girl get out the way I'm no one's fool

[Hook]
If you were the best thing for me
Tell me why you had to take all this time
You and the rest ignore me
A year ago why would I ever wanna try again
You were the right one honey
Why you got a look on your face like you've done this before
Keep tripping
I ain't picking you up off the floor


[Verse II]
Back before they found me
You would've forgot my name
You would've forgot my name
Now you're up here clowning
All up in my face trying to get your way
I don't even know what you think you're doing

Oooo if I was Master P
I done told you to get up
(Ay sha na na na)
Oooo if I was P.O.S
I would simply say fuck your stuff
Go and play your games with someone else

Baby when you talk to me
I don't get the feeling in my stomach that you're looking for love
You ain't gonna find it
Ain't that really hard to see
That you believe I'm somebody I would never ever become

If I was Dr. Dre
I would say that you ain't shit
You know how the rest goes honey
If I was House of Pain
I would tell you to jump around with someone else who gives a damn

[Hook x2]
