[Verse 1: Grieves]
Yo, now I was standin' in the middle of it all
Tryin' to face it
Everythin' around me has been a break in the chain that I placed faith and it figures
'Cause ever since a youngin'
I was runnin' with the devil
In a race to the bottom of my patience, scattered
Tryin' to pick the pieces off the ground
Love is nothin' but a memory
I fight to keep around now
The beats on, but I'm laggin'
Never catchin' it
The never-ending circle
A definition of irrelevant, a man
With nothin' but a pencil in his hand
Tryin' to scribble down it permanent
So he can feed his fam
But you take it all for granted
You walk into my temple open-handed
But you don't see the terrifyin' things that I've been keepin'
Underneath these bloody bandages
You see the world's much realer on this side of the camera lens
You see depth, but only get six feet
I cheat death and never get no sleep

[Chorus: Paris Alexa]
It doesn't matter who you are
The sun is gonna set behind you (behind you, behind you)
All alone in these streets
It doesn't matter where you go
The night is always owed a little bit of blood that flows inside you (inside you, inside you)
I close my eyes but never gettin' no sleep

[Post-Chorus]
And never gettin' no (never gettin' no)
And never never gettin' no sleep (no sleep)
And never gettin' no

[Verse 2]
Yo, now Chords told me I should rap for a bit
Fuck a typical design
I was floatin' in the ether
Trying to ease a worried mind, feelin'
Drunk, weavin', tryin' to leave it all behind
Life's mystery is leavin' and chasin' it through the vines
But I'm fine with it
I never need the definition
I'm gettin' used to them spellin' me with a letter missin'
Another pistol in my hand
Drawin' pictures in the sand
When I'm slowly becomin' one of my premonitions, heavy
They call me heavy
I was followin' the light that was shinin'
And signifyin' the ending of it
The flies gather in a bottle even if it's empty
It's temptin'
To know that even just a simple little thought of it can leave them tremblin' on the floor
You looking at me like I haven't been around it before, man
You want the recipe for just one piece
I cheat death and never get no sleep

[Chorus: Paris Alexa]
It doesn't matter who you are
The sun is gonna set behind you (behind you, behind you)
All alone in these streets
It doesn't matter where you go
The night is always owed a little bit of blood that flows inside you (inside you, inside you)
I close my eyes but never gettin' no sleep
It doesn't matter who you are
The sun is gonna set behind you (behind you, behind you)
All alone in these streets
It doesn't matter where you go
The night is always owed a little bit of blood that flows inside you (inside you, inside you)
I close my eyes but never gettin' no sleep


[Post-Chorus]
I never gettin' no (never gettin' no)
I never never gettin' no sleep
I never gettin' no
I never never gettin' no sleep
I never gettin' no (and never gettin' no)
I never never gettin' no sleep
I never gettin' no
