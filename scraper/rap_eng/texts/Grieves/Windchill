[Verse 1]
I was born in a city
Yeah, where the windchill could kill ya
And frostbite the smile off your face when it grills ya
So naturally learn to make it out in the cold
And carve emotion in the ice blocks hidden in the snow
And it shows
King of the winter bitter and froze
With a head full of blackouts
Breakin' through the ropes
And I choke, at every little punch I've tried to throw
But the devil hovered over me tellin' me where to go
Go home, and die where the heart is
Life has been a series of goodbyes I've been fighting to depart with
And hardships, shot down and buried in the marshes
With nothin' but a love letter stapled to my carcass
Identify me, feel I'm too far gone
See the look inside your eyes when the blues song's on
So sing all of it, try to harmonize me when I'm gone
Cause at this point I'm barely holdin' on

[Hook]
It's a cold cold world we face
With miles of frozen road
That I drove down on my way
I'm as cold as snow
Falling slowly to the ground all around you

[Verse 2]
Black ice forming on the tongue
This is just another part of life
Let it melt in the sunshine and freeze overnight
I was built for the blizzard and lived with the ice
And smothered every flame that I ever tried to ignite because of comfort
Wrapped up in a blanket made of snow
Chippin' off the frozen condensation on my bones
And I can feel it in the morning when it blows
And it rifles through the streets like a bullet from the cold
And I know it, feel it on a first name basis
And laugh at the games that plays with my patience
Cause I've been looking at the world through a glacier
And know what it's like to be hopelessly underrated
It's sick spittin' the water under the bridge
With a shivering image of what a fine life is
Cause I've been fishing at this lake since a kid
I know exactly where to walk when the ice gets thin
Come on

[Hook]
It's a cold cold world we face
With miles of frozen road
That I drove down on my way
I'm as cold as snow
