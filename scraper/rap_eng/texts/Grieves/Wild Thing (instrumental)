You should seen it before you jumped on in, and realized
That if you look before you leap then you decide to sink or swim
But you dove into that social pool, powdering your nose huh
And going home with people that you hardly even know
And you're a ghost
Now look at you, you hardly even speak
Haven't woken up to the thought of getting clean in f*ckin' weeks
And if you did, I guarantee you'd never leave the sheets
Home alone until that fix comes, put you on your feet
And some blame it on the city, some blame it on the streets
Some bury it inside beneath that dream of being free
But I can see it in your eyes, that you're aware of what it needs
How you feel like it's the only thing in love that doesn't leave
And it's a shame, cause I remember life without the games
And the bittersweet acknowledgement of how it's gonna change
But the rain can't wash you if you're laying in the dirt
And the pain can't change you if you blame it on the hurt

So God help us
So God help us
So God help us
So God help us

I mean look at you, Mr. I-don't-even-have-a-clue
Mr. get it right the first time or shut it down from you
Cause you're the boss, and Daddy taught you how to be a mine
Via stepping out on Mommy and releasing with your hands
And now it hurts, cause you can't even question what is right
Life is nothing but a challenge and you want to win the fight
So go ahead, try and make that old man proud
And beat that last remaining angel off your shoulder to the ground
And then escape, slap the world steady in its face and make moves on em
Force em all to cater to your taste
Exterminate the good in you that tried to fly away
When you figured out the only human part of you is pain
And then it raised you, sunk its dirty fangs into your drained roots
Threw you to the fire when you thought that you were flame proof
So that's the reason why you're sinking alone
And going home without a rescuer and drinking alone

So God help us
So God help us
So God help us
So God help us

Now jump, yeah jump into the fire, just jump
Yeah jump into the fire, just jump, yeah jump into the fire
You're mommy's little angel, I'm daddy's little squire
Now jump, yeah jump into the fire, just jump
Yeah jump into the fire, just jump, yeah jump into the fire
You're mommy's little angel, I'm daddy's little squire
