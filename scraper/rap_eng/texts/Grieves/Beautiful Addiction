Unrealistic, my beautiful addiction
(X2)
She infects my brain like nothing else
An addiction I can not kick on my own I need some help
I stand on the pier with the fishing rod and bait
To attract that perfect mate my health
The task, in a search, so I sit back, relax
Do not need feed back while on my perch
I light my torch and abort the mission
Often take it right back up the evening after
Misses me, you still evade
In the back of my mind you still equate
To an unrealistic woman of mystic fate
I grade my effort B+
Jesus can't save me from these nuts I'm crazy
Baby, take a tip from me, stay away from me
Cause I'm only out for one thing that's music lady luck
Now fuck a shady tuck away one night mends
Baby just for now, you might be just my style
But you're not the one
So don't get stuck on the thought of us
Cause I'm in love with a dream
An inception, implanted, by love supreme
She's tattooed, and a Virgo
With a gorgeous smile and beautiful lips
And a Leo, and a tom girl, and a Pisces
Who switches sips like Dionysus
So intelligent my best friend
And my advice is taken with a grain of salt
In acceptance of all the vices
I implore I adore women and women adore me

Your my beautiful addiction
And a strangers to these fictions
Love or its lust, never thought it could mean this much
Your my beautiful addiction, beautiful addiction
Beautiful..

Grieves:
I been livin' the impossible dream
And found it most of the attention I'm gettin' isn't appealin'
Look, how the hell do you think I would have reacted
To women writin' numbers on a napkin?
Tellin' me I can have it
Talkin' up a one night stand
With a girl that only sleeps with bands
And baby I can't stand it
Cause I was never raised to be a rock star
And always thought that love would be the anchor when I lost heart
But I don't seem to be attractin' a type
That wants to pack it up and have that life
And if you ask me right, then maybe I would take that chance
And stop runnin' from the flames that dance
But lately I can't stand it, the fans with the motives to fuck
And all these devil headed women only in it for blood
When I'm going to my mama she's askin' me if I'm nuts
And wonderin' why I'm always associated with sluts
And it hits me, this is not the life I want
And you are clearly not the wife I want
I paid the price I'm gone
And I don't know if I'm a ever find it
But I'll never see the summit 'till I climb it
I'll set my sights
