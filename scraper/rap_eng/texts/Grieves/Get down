I wish that I could remember the day I lost it
Flip through the pages I’ve written when I’m unconscious
I black out and I really don’t understand it
But everything’s relative
Everything’s relative right now
I feel my life is a physical writing block
Repeating over the past
While fighting against the clock
And it hurts me
Deep down inside, yo it urks me
Any incentive of a poetical scent of purpose is gone
And I don’t really say goodbye’s much
Wasn’t worth the wait
But this is plague is mine (yup)
So if I write it, in script it across the airwaves
Boogie down, break neck style
Emotion narrates the passion
Single admission to see the facet
Mingle within it and inflict it within this disaster?
Like welcome
I don’t know what it means but it helps me
Another dying dream in the land of living wealthy
To pray on
Constricted to the grey spots
Life is painted in four palette pictures
With the emptiness my pain caused
Believe it though
Even in it’s meaningless
I tread the water dream fully
Exceeding in what’s eating me
I get down

(Chorus)

I get down (and its like this)
Down like how?
Man, I black out the pressure
Fade out the sounds
I get down (its like this)
Down like how?
How down cut you’re wrists down
Pump you’re fists up
I get down (and its like this)
Down like how?
Man, I black out the pressure
Fade out the sounds
I get down
And its like this

Born into it
Another grade-A reject
Another tombstone in the grave out of respect
The descent in my life infused with religion
Got all my friends shot out the air like clay pigeons
And it isn’t
What you envisioned when you admitted
The single emit smidgen of ever giving a damn
So what’s my life?
Another breathe taken
Water under the bridge
A fool for the making
It must be
I mean, love don’t trust me
Fight for its feeling
While I die in its company
I get down
And it’s impossible to get up
A heart full of bricks
With a mouth full of hiccups
With more dust to kick up
Then ambition itself
Handcuffed to the furnace of my own vision of hell
I seem docile
Yea, born into the wrong child
Fight against the smiles and frowns
People I get down

(Chorus)
