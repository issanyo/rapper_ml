[Verse 1: Grieves]
I lay it down
Looking like I walked through hell
Rhyme sturdy though ain't nobody ringing my bell
That's a sure shot, William Tell
I go get them and I won't stop
Rhythm compels
The world listens when the show stops
Only the quell can make venom so
Don't let me catch your ass slippin'
Mic check 1, 2
Hey, hey, ship called, mayday
North Star fallin' out the sky like it's J-Day
Back to the bay like K. Flay
Baby, I'm a grown ass man, I don't nae-nae
All I do is two step
True def
Blu-Ray vision on them
R.S.E
New wave going swimming on them
Hold up (hold up)
I'm 'bout to throw up
Motherfuckers making me sick like Ebola
Roll up put them on blast and it's over
Got that Pappy Van Wink in a glass and a cold-shoulder
I'm chillin'
I'm chillin'

[Chorus: Grieves]
Phone keeps ringin', I ain't picking up
They tuggin' on my strings, I ain't gettin' up
I never mind 'em
They all behind me
They can talk that shit, now, whenever they want
(Whenever they want)
(Whenever they want)
(Whenever they want, yeah)
Ice cold

[Verse 2: Romaro Franceswa]
(I'm tellin' time, yeah)
Now say what you want
Private calls in them dinin' halls, we don't answer those
Ain't comin' close to talkin' to souls that's sweet as cantaloupe
I'm too dope
To be phased by mirrors and smoke, mirages of hope
The only time they're on demand, hahâ€”is holdin' remotes
Please don't play wit' me, you ain't a friend of me
You know that's plain to see, they want to aim at me
They know I am a G like 40 deep
Might turn your squad into a vacancy like where your family be
Please believe that we won't catch no felonies
Oh, now we don't like the violence, but to stay alive boy, you've got to find balance
Oh, that's the model for life
And I ain't dappin' all these niggas, wouldn't throw 'em in a fight, no
Take my spot that's what you want
I'm heaven-sent, you irrelevant, so they can say what they want
I'm chillin', I'm chillin' (Ice cold)

[Chorus: Grieves]
Phone keeps ringin', I ain't picking up
They tuggin' on my strings, I ain't gettin' up
I never mind 'em
They all behind me
They can talk that shit, now, whenever they want
(Whenever they want)
(Whenever they want)
(Whenever they want, yeah)
Ice cold
