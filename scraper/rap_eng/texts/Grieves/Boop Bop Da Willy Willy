[Verse 1: Grieves]
Been a minute since I hit 'em with it
A little boop bop da willy willy
Your whole crew caught the willy nillies second that first note played
I was sipping on some Grade-A like it's a pay day
Kick it, Pelé
Fender Rhodes riding in the back, swing lazy
I'm on that
Don't stop baby I'm on that cell phone buzzing ain't calling your mom back like: ring, ring, ring, ring, ring
Goddamn, Miss Peters
We gettin' drunk and standin' close to the speakers
Dancin' like somebody pissed in both of my sneakers
I can creep out the back door and poof—be gone
Motherfuckers always concerned with who be on
I do these songs and keep it movin' and maybe one of these days, I can show you how to do it
Let's go

[Refrain]
What you gonna do with that flavor?

[Chorus: Paris Alexa and Grieves]
Don't play games with me (don't worry, I won't girl)
Don't you talk like I can't see right through you (don't worry, I won't girl)
Oh, you better not bullshit me (don't worry, I won't girl)
I know your kind
You always lyin'
I think it's time they finally promised somethin' new

[Verse 2: Grieves]
Yo, It's been a minute since they got a lil'
A little Boop Bop Da Willy Willy, huh
Raised the bar about a millie'
In this cloud covered Emerald City
Heard you was looking for some new shit
You could groove with
Touch a boob with
Take it back home and drink half a bottle of booze with all that
No shit baby, it's all that
Phone keeps ringin'
Bank all on my ball sack like: ring, ring, ring, ring, ring
Don't call here Kevin
No worries, we turn it up to eleven
The meters up in the red and my buzz is fully extended
I'm swervin'
Don't stop giving me bourbon
I'm half an hour away from becoming a new person
And that's all that I got for now for y'all
Rhymesayers Entertainment feeling 10 feet tall
And I'm out

[Refrain]
What you gonna do with that flavor?
What you gonna do with that style?

[Chorus: Paris Alexa and Grieves]
Don't play games with me (don't worry, I won't girl)
Don't you talk like I can't see right through you (don't worry, I won't girl)
Oh, you better not bullshit me (don't worry, I won't girl)
I know your kind
You always lyin'
I think it's time they finally promised somethin' new
