I said the lights don’t help these days
Chances are that if you’re 10 rows back, I can’t even see your face
I’ve been hidin in the only thing that ever made me safe
Long enough to make me addicted, turn it into my cage
Who the fuck wants to drink my wine?
Put the last drop on hold, honey, I don’t think I’ll make it in time
This whole game’s got me fakin a smile
And tied down to the tracks I laid down tryna gain an extra mile
This is all of me, another thorn-stem apology
Writin in the heat of depression, dyin for harmony
Lost - til they find me with a bullet with the cross in it
Hung around my neck like somebody told me there’s God in it
Yeah, I guess I got a problem with reality
And never look to Heaven when the devil in me flashes his teeth
That’s the part of me I’m tryna change
And swing hard now, I’m breakin the chains
Now get away from me

[Hook - DTV]
I said the road’s so hard and rough
Said I’m tryin not to lose my way
In a world so cold and tough
So disheveled that it digs my grave
What’s holdin me down?
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
What’s holdin me down?
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

From time to time
Like Bryan, I’m a shell of myself
If I was a weaker man, I’d put a shell in myself
Either ballin on a budget or fallin on a deficit
Plenty of self-worth with no means of investin it
The blessin’s get few and far between, so I’m stressin shit
Lady Luck is celibate, she ain’t fuckin wit me
Hidin behind a habit, starts to lookin mighty temptin
Hurtin behind a image, I ain’t pimpin I’m just limpin
Tryna walk it off or walk it out
That’s just what the south’s about
Handlin adversity whenever I step out the house
Whether the weather sunny or nastier than sauerkraut
Every endeavor takes bits of faith until you left with doubt
No tears for fears, but I swear I won’t shout
Kick, scream, and strain but that ain’t gon change a thang
Big screen the game, you see but don’t feel the pain
A junkie is a cripple but he won’t show you the cane

I said the road’s so hard and rough
Said I’m tryin not to lose my way
In a world so cold and tough
So disheveled that it digs my grave
What’s holdin me down?
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
What’s holdin me down?
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

I got this restlessness in me, and I don’t understand
There’s no measure to this man, but I keep sinkin in that sand
How will I ever be able to grow?
Feelin like the Last Dragon and I’m searchin for the glow
Days darker than the crow, fly when the sky’s night
Can’t get caught up in the lows, tryna keep my eyes white, but I smoke
Strive to do right like them flight brothas
And not just cuz them red and blue lights love us
I’m scared to live, not afraid of law
Shit, I ain’t scared of niggas that ain’t scared at all
But I am scared of fate, hope you hear my call
And ain’t no crabs in that bucket, none will share my fall
I got shackles on my feet, hands bound to my chest
Convicted of bein a victim of self is my best
Just livin life tryna end up on Heaven’s guestlist
Or living life, do what I fuckin feel til death
It’s hard

What’s holdin me down?
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
What’s holdin me down?
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
