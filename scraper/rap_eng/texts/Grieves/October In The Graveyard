[Hook:]
Hey, take that devil out yo' head
Lay your skeletons to rest
Bed of roses where you
Lay it down, definitely

Those words 'cross...
Your headstone
I pray for the moment
You awake

Mighty is the bitter blade
Crimson beaded water falling out of your grave
Another dusty record plays
Dancing by yourself in the blue shade

I done dug a lot of graves to uncover the bones
And release you from the dark
Cause the moment that you seen, me, coming
You were both, feet, running to the reaper's arms

[Hook]

That rusty metal gate'll fall
Plowin' through that field in which you silently lay
Lovely, little paper doll
Scared of what that ghost in you might say

And I've done dug a lot of graves to uncover the bones
And release you from the dark
Cause the moment that I seen you runnin
Fo' that last train comin', it done broke my heart

[Hook]
