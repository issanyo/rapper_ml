[Intro]
Yo, uh

[Verse 1]
I said, I came through buzzin'
I was lookin' for a little funky jam
That I could stick at you
I got my headphones bumpin'
If you isolate my vocals you could probably hear it bleedin' through, word
Every whatever you feelin'
I ain't wastin' my time with a bunch of fuckin' chameleons
Stand out
Yeah, go and figure it out
Talk shit, you gettin' hit in the mouth
So go and think about it

[Refrain]
There's a warm breeze blowin' from the North Beach, baby
While you're sittin' 'round wastin' time
It's a cold world, crazy how you'd rather stand, stupid
Gettin' old instead of gettin' game tight
I'm on the road and I ain't slowin' for trolls
So you can go on alone if you think I'm lyin'
'Cause ain't nobody here got the time

[Hook]
'Cause everybody's feelin' (fine)
We feelin' a-okay
They lookin' at us like we came from space and I don't care
They can go and complain
That's what happens when you doin' yo' thing
Everybody's feelin' (fine)
We feelin' pretty damn good
They looking at us like I knew they would and I don't mind
Man, let them foam at the mouth
We about to turn this motherfucker out
Let me tell em somethin'

[Verse 2]
Uh, I kept it smooth on it
You can slide a booty in the general direction of the nearest me, hah!
I got the groove goin'
Now would be the perfect time for you to go and show 'em how to drink and eat
Ooh, and bottoms up to the ceilin'
I ain't wastin' my time with your constant negative feelings
Step back
Yeah, you can study the math
Talk shit and watch the rest of us laugh
And go and cry about it

[Refrain]
There's a dive bar sittin' on the Southside playin' James Brown like it never changed
Got the dance floor swingin' like a power line
Blowin' in the wind when it's gonna rain out
And the nights keep flashin'
And the ice keeps splashin' in the glass like it knows your name
Man, you should get up and go insane

[Hook]
'Cause everybody's feelin' (fine)
We feelin' a-okay
They lookin' at us like we came from space and I don't care
They can go and complain
That's what happens when you doin' yo' thing
Everybody's feelin' (fine)
We feelin' pretty damn good
They looking at us like I knew they would and I don't mind
Man, let them foam at the mouth
We about to turn this motherfucker out
Let me tell em somethin'

[Bridge]
We were feelin' alright
So what you talking that shit for?
'Cause we were feelin' alright (fine)

[Hook]
We feelin' a-okay
They lookin' at us like we came from space and I don't care
They can go and complain
That's what happens when you doin' yo' thing
Everybody's feelin' (fine)
We feelin' pretty damn good
They looking at us like I knew they would and I don't mind
Man, let them foam at the mouth
We about to turn this motherfucker out
Let me tell em somethin' (fine)

[Outro]
We were feelin' alright
So what you talking that shit for?
We were feelin' alright (fine)
