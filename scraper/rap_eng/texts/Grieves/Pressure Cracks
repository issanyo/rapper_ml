[Verse 1]

I feel like I've been breathing out of an exhaust pipe
On the job site, with a fist full of brittle sand
Should've seen it coming/ a mile away from that little hill in which I'm making a stand on
It makes a man of me, (doesn't it?) and if it never kills me then I get a pass
Wish I coulda opened up the air around me just a little bit so I could take a gasp
Who the hell is watchin?
Put a notch in; my belt, keep it on the track
'Shoulda-Woulda-Coulda' never made a difference
When you're playing chicken with your only chance
But it made a man of me right? Mad man
I gotta dance around and play in sounds...
Wish I knew back then what I know now
Ya look at me now

[Hook]

Dodging forever
Spending a fortune to figure it out
I don't believe it, never learned how
All of this pressure is driving me wild
Look at me now
Look at me now

[Verse 2]

I'm starting to feel like it's stackin on my shoulders
Another soldier with little patience to see the dawn
Fought a lot of odds in the name of "Cause,"
Put 'em in a box; buried in the lawn
But I learned a lesson from it, (didn't I?)
And if I didn't who the hell is gonna teach me?
I've been looking for answers and none of em ever offer the lesson that'll reach me
Who can see me? -Losing personal relationships like people do their house keys
I've been outside, looking inside, with a shadow casted all around me
And they doubt me, try to throw a little part of me away with every frown
Just wish they saw what I know now
Yeah, look at me now

[Hook]

Dodging forever
Spending a fortune to figure it out
I don't believe it, never learned how
All of this pressure is driving me wild
Look at me now
Look at me now
