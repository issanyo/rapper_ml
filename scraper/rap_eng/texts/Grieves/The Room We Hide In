I'm not a person of my words anymore. I exist inside the dream that was started by a child that now lives
Inside of me. I can't play anymore I'm falling off the edge, I'm fighting every urge I've ever had to strike
It down and leave it dead. I make music, pain made me wanna take to it, fate drew it right in front your
Muthuh****ckin face use it, right? But there's a different way you view my life so meet me in the middle and
Throw rocks from the room you hide in. I get inside it, how sicks it's mind that it's got me reaching out to
Something like it thought that I was trying to find it. Lost and it's harder than expected, spotlights burn
The side of me that shouldn't be affected. And I try to be simple, don't put me on a pedastle. I'm twice
As fucked as everyone and scared like all the rest of you. Please, all I want is peace when the sunsets, and to
Breathe and taste what hasn't come yet. Listen to my words...

(CHORUS)
Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind; I was fine, I was good, I was faithful, but now I'm crazy
And I'm lost and I hate you. Because you took it all away from me
Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind; I was fine, I was good, I was faithful, but now I'm crazy
And I'm lost and I hate you. Because you took it all away from me

I chose my own path and left home without a roadmap, dressed for sunshine, I should have known better to pack
For those days that would turn rainy, cold, and black. See I heard the stories but I didn't know the facts
I assumed all was perfect from the photographs until the light hit the surface to expose the cracks
What's worse than not knowing if your still on track? Paranoid and having thoughts about turning back
I've seen dreams transform into the worst disease, and almost let the doubt kill my will to succeed. But
I've traveled too far to turn around and leave, get angry pound my fist into the ground and bleed. I'll
Never break my creed to sit at a table with thieves, tricks up their sleeves saying how my music should be
I keep on with the profits and build it with Grieves; knowing one day I'll prove what I've always believed
Eventually I know that day will be ceased, I know that day will be ceased

(CHORUS)
Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind; I was fine, I was good, I was faithful, but now I'm crazy
And I'm lost and I hate you. Because you took it all away from me
Once upon a time, a long time ago before I lost my mind; I was fine, I was good, I was faithful, but now I'm crazy
And I'm lost and I hate you. Because you took it all away from me
