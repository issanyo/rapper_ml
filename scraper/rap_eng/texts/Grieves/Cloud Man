Here I am sittin' on top of the world
With nothin but a bottle of
Gin cause it makes me smile when (ha)
All your little prayers fell
Cause you shoot your words like a torpedo
With the light that shines in front of
You silly little fool of a pawn
You can't control the boat that you're on

It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the weather at all
It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the level you're on

You gotta funny way of begging for help
Screaming at the skylight
Blinded with your fist in the air
Blinded with your fist in the air
And you can't change the world by
Blowing smoke for fate
You stupid little fool of a pawn
You can't control the boat that you're on

It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the weather at all
It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the level you're on

Can't take it away
You can't take it away
I got a point for you all
(na na na na na)
You can't take it away
You can't take it awaaay hey
(ah ahh, na na na na na)

It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the weather at all
It goes on, it goes on
Never gets better no matter the level you're on
