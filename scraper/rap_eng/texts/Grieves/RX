[Verse 1]
I can feel it in my chest, feel like everybody's watchin'
I don't think that I can stop it
They put me on the pills, they just make me feel lethargic
I don't take 'em anymore, I'm medicated with the vodka
Put it in my cup, sedated, dedicate it to the ghost
Blurred vision, I'm surrounded by the smoke
I ain't breathin' right, I feel like I could choke
And it's hard to climb around it when you're running out of rope

[Refrain]
And it feels like
I'm standing in a puddle of gasoline with a match and a polaroid of the city lights
Trying to get ahold of myself  with a bit of help from the bottle has been a tricky flight
Feeling like the key to it all is out in a thunderstorm dangling from a little kite
Every drop of blood in my body is turning into a tidal wave of the killing kind

[Pre-Hook]
Don't forget to breathe out though
Don't forget to breathe out though
Don't forget to breathe out though
Don't forget to breathe out though

[Hook]
You keep pullin' me down, pullin' me down
Pullin' me under the water
You keep callin' my name, callin' my name
Callin' me back to you
You keep pullin' me down, pullin' me down
Pullin' me under the water
You keep callin' my name, callin' my name
Callin' me back to you

[Verse 2]
I ain't got the answers
I'm a man that's tryin' to make it on his own without a hiccup
And they don't understand it
They just looking at me probably thinkin' I'm a fuckin' slip up
And everyone 'round me actin'
Like they got a better way to settle when it kicks up
The venom only goin' to take a minute 'til it sink into your system

[Refrain]
And it feels like
All the little the tremors are starting to shake a part of me loose that I need to make it out
Something is calling me to the depths and I'm pretty sure that I let it keep taking me down
Nothing is ever on solid ground anymore and I feel it rumbling fading me out
Every drop of blood in my body was turning into an avalanche when it came around

[Pre-Hook]
Don't forget to breathe out though
Don't forget to breathe out though
Don't forget to breathe out though
Don't forget to breathe out though

[Hook]
You keep pullin' me down, pullin' me down
Pullin' me under the water
You keep callin' my name, callin' my name
Callin' me back to you
You keep pullin' me down, pullin' me down
Pullin' me under the water
You keep callin' my name, callin' my name
Callin' me back to you
You keep pullin' me down, pullin' me down
Pullin' me under the water
You keep callin' my name, callin' my name
Callin' me back to you
You keep pullin' me down, pullin' me down
Pullin' me under the water
You keep callin' my name, callin' my name
Callin' me back to you
