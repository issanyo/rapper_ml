[Verse One: Grieves]
What’s the deal with all the speed racing
Fast life, fast girls, yeah
Fast money, fast cars, fast world
It’s a black swirl spinning
And it won't slow down
I can’t live on a rocket
I’m way too grounded to ride with ya
Mama told me live my life
Said that I don’t need to rush it
Ima be alright
And it’s funny cuz in high school
The view was like
If you don’t rush to get ahead
You will lose this fight
How perfect
Even our educators are turbo charged
Line em up, knock em out
Into some old job
I confront those odds
With my own manner
Slow it down, walk it out
See the panorama
That’s the life I lead
And I’m fine with it
I supply my needs
And make a fine living
So you can miss me when you fly on past
And Ima finish up at my pace
And praise my tracks, like
What do I got to lose?

(Hook: Choklate)
What have I got to lose
Taking in all of you
(Mmm)
Ain’t got nothing to worry ‘bout
Cuz I’m taking the scenic route yeah
(Yeah)
I’m taking the scenic route
(I’m taking the scenic route)
I’m taking the scenic route yeah
Ain’t got nothing to worry ‘bout
(Worry ‘bout)
Cuz I’m taking the scenic route yeah

[Verse Two: Grieves]
You outta try to slow it down homie
There ain’t a prize for first
We all get the same ride in that long line o’ hearses
The same quiet night in the dirt
And if you rush it like you breakfast
I bet that you won’t ever find a purpose at all
It’s crazy how we got this way
And how we find a definition in the spot we place
It’s a long hard walk you race
And when I see you at the end
I wanna talk about the heart I gave
My compassion, gripping to the road with a solid step
Filling up my soul with the flood water that I swept
Not the best and I won't be
I don’t feel the need to see myself
Inside the shimmer of your trophy
Move on, move on, you can miss me
Ima move at my pace
Take the opportunities it gives me
Cuz once you hit the finish
There’s never going back
So Ima take slow and see everything that it has
What do I got to lose?

(Hook: Choklate)
What have I got to lose
Taking in all of you
(Mmm)
Ain’t got nothing to worry ‘bout
Cuz I’m taking the scenic route yeah
(Yeah)
I’m taking the scenic route
(I’m taking the scenic route)
I’m taking the scenic route yeah
Ain’t got nothing to worry ‘bout
(Worry ‘bout)
Cuz I’m taking the scenic route yeah

{Bridge: Grieves and Choklate:}

Cool your jets man
And walk slow
(Yea)
Cool your jets man
And walk slow
(Yea)
Cool your jets man
And walk slow

(Hook: Choklate)
What have I got to lose
Taking in all of you
(Mmm)
Ain’t got nothing to worry ‘bout

I’m taking the scenic route yeah
Ain’t got nothing to worry ‘bout
(Worry ‘bout)
Cuz I’m taking the scenic route yeah
