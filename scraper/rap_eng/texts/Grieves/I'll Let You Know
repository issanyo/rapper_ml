I’ll let you know, and I’ll let you know
I’ll let you know the deal
I’ll let you know, and I’ll let you know
I’ll let you know the deal
I’ll let you know, and I’ll let you know
I’ll let you know the deal
I’ll let you know, and I’ll let you know
I’ll let you know for real

There’s a bunch of dark streets in a town I know
Bought a house there, standing on the ground I own
I used to take a couple trips a year
Fly back to it, water the plants and sit on the pier
And it tricked me
Really, knowing I could take that trip
Got a place next to my big sis
With a great view facing the cliff
Everybody eventually ended up jumping from plumitting to the grips
Of reality
Happily I made my home
Out of broken glass hopes and a few cracked bones
Built shelter outta all that snow
Put a dangerous shade over my eyes and the front windows
Like wooh, maybe that’s the reason that I had to leave
Sold the place as is, gave up my keys
Still a gutter full of leaves
Lockin up the gate
Finally feelin I’m free

I watched the town disappear from the rear view mirror
When I left that place, it wasn’t safe for me
And just because I found the words to tell you about it
Does not make it okay, don’t pray for me

I’ll let you know, and I’ll let you know
I’ll let you know the deal (x3)
I’ll let you know, and I’ll let you know
I’ll let you know for real

There’s a bunch of sharp curves in the route I take
Used to whip around them fast, like it’s just a game
Like a devil to the flame
I was only happy in the heat
Tryin to fuel it off of pain
And it worked for a little bit
Even saw the top speed rise
Turn the lights off, cover up my eyes
Rode blind for the hell of it, never looked back
Had everybody watchin til I flew it off the track
And it crashed
Yea, threw me from the seat
Beat me down with reality and dragged me by the feet
Then it layed me on the cold wet street like an offering
And honestly, I wasn’t sure if I was gonna walk from it at all
Sprawled out, lookin for a change
Feeling lucky I was young enough to get up out the rain
So if life hadn’t stepped in
Death would have it’s claim
And none of this I’d ever get to say:

I saw the headlights fade
To put it bluntly, I’d say it scared the shit up outta me
And just because I found the words to talk about it
Doesn’t take the glass outta my knee, don’t pray for me

I’ll let you know, and I’ll let you know
I’ll let you know the deal (x3)
I’ll let you know, and I’ll let you know
I’ll let you know for real
