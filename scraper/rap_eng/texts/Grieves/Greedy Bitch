You're such a greedy bastard
You're such a broken king that you
Don't know when you've already won
You wanna conquer everything

You're such a greedy bitch
You're such a hopeless queen that you
Don't know when you've been overthrown
You wanna fight for everything

The last castle fell, he wrote it in song
She got the whole world to control, and hold in your palms
Now that you've got the juice, dawg, how's it gonna go?
You wanna rip out a bruised heart and swallow it whole?
You wanna flip out and move on, find a new home
You wanna kick out the new start and call her on the phone like...

There's no way you'll ever find another like me!
If your new man don't like it then I'll come over and fight him!

Pshhh, let go..
Why you try to keep her in a neck hold?
When every question she asks is answered with a HELL NO!
What you trying to do?
Man it doesn't make a difference if shes lying to you
Besides...you're the one who wanted outta there too
Now youre so damn jealous you dunno what to do
So...you can hold on or sink with the ship and keep
Pulling it
Pulling it
Pulling down....

You're such a greedy bastard
You're such a broken king that you
Don't know when you've already won
You wanna conquer everything

You're such a greedy bitch
Youre such a hopeless queen that you
Dont know when youve been overthrown
You wanna fight for everything

The last petals picked
Your Romeo's dead
You need to pick yourself up and start living instead
You need to stop giving in to all the shit that he says
Makes you feel like a bitch when you try to forget...
Girl...
Stop thinking he'll be coming back around for ya
Open up the car door and drive it outta town with ya
I hate to break it to ya lady, but its over
So you can cancel the search for your four leafed clover
Cuz ain't no amount of wishing gonna bring him back
Ain't no amount of giving gonna change his tracks
Ain't no amount of cinnamon gonna sweeten the crap
That you've been taken from this dude tryna pretend that you're happy so...
Guess your looking for the sunshine and progress
Waiting in the rain for your prince in your prom dress
You can hold on and sink with the ship and keep
Pulling it
Pulling it
Pulling down....

You're such a greedy bastard
You're such a broken king that you
Don't know when you've already won
You wanna conquer everything

You're such a greedy bitch
You're such a hopeless queen that you
Don't know when you've been overthrown
You wanna fight for everything
