[Grieves]
Say something
Nowadays I'm all ears
Screaming out over the speakers
Breaking eggs with no fear
Made a name as a stranger that painted his pain on a mirror
Stared straight into the eyes of it and faced it for years
Like (ayyyyyyy!) I feel I caved a lot of principles
Emptied a drinking problem in a melting pot of little girls
Like huh, at least I'm honest in my music
Hard to be confident talking 'bout my losses and bruises
But break it down how I know it would never let it control me
Exploded emotions out of my broken soul is important
So, groove with it
I gotta lotta time to brew in it
22 stitches young buck payin' dues, Listen!
I got a itch in my system thats fixin' to stick to the rhythm explicit of when I'm livin''it
With words I can touch the sky in its face, open up wide, let go with the power to fly away, go-

[Hook]
I refuse to stay
In the middle while I sacrifice my fate
Baby I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fly away x2
(yeah yeah)
I hold my culture on the table to see
(eh eh)
Been told that the truth will set you free

Yeah come on, yo

I brought loose of the change just to put a solid fist up
To drip though the distance to whither the prison
Within this I'm alive
And I surprised a couple of people
Been stuck in the slums of the past without a vision to reach to
And thank God for the music
And gettin' addicted to it
For killin' the shit constrictin' me to grip to its uses
I've been down
And thats the single reason that I get up
Its the love of my life the motivation when I get stuck
Stop, and open up your eyes for a second
You wanna see life's limits you should try and dissect it
Never knew about the power that could line a sentence
'till I implied it inside of the part of the mind that invented
Like (microphone screetch)
And I don't need to try to be different
I'm fine with the life that resides inside the bars of the written
Because with words I can touch the sky in its face, open up wide let go with the power to fly away, go-

[Hook]
I refuse to stay
In the middle while I sacrifice my fate
Baby I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fly away x2
(yeah yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah thats right!
