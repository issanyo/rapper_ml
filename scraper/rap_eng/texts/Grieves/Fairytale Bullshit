Grieves:
Y'know I just don't understand sometimes
The shit is so confusing
Y'know, you think it's right
It's just like everything blows up in your face one day, yeah
I don't know, y'know
I tried right? I tried

[Verse 1:]
I get these phone calls waking me, telling me that its over and over
I won't hear you trying to tell me that it's hopeless, this is bogus
Never dedicated time into the hopeless
Never dedicated love into the hope
Why do you treat me like I'm no one?
Now I'm searching for the answer to the question: why does love hurt me?
When ____ your accepting
A lesson is always learned, but now I'm not ready to spend it (I don't want this)
I try to say "I love you" as I finish out this sentence, want to end this
Want to stop it and leave it right where it started
Want to break down screaming and break this whole world's heart
And yet I, see my options as you claw me
No I'm not okay, and I don't want to hear you're sorry (Come and tell me)

[Chorus:]x2
Why's this happening?
Love is slowly molded into tragedy
Stuck in front of the crossfire
____ in reality
Happily ever after is some bullshit, it's fairytale bullshit
I want it but it's hopeless (Passing me by)

Why do you push me over, break me down, and build me back up? (I don't understand)
Why do you push me over, break me down, and build me back up? (I got a right to know)

[Verse 2:]
Yo, you can catch me on my balcony looking up at the stars
Thinking about my love lost, life lessons, and scars
My God, I'm finding it hard to write my verses
Broken angels pass my window and hover above the curtains
Never state the purpose
They just kick it and make me nervous
And it hurts, cause all I get from this lesson is that it's worthless and some days
I want to walk in rain and scream your name out
Beat my pain down and bleed my faith out
But still I stay strong ____ that it's okay at all
You can build a person up and push them down when you want
But now that it's gone ____ breeds in every thought
Research the meaning when you say that "I love you" and then skeet off

[Chorus:]x2
Why's this happening?
Love is slowly molded into tragedy
Stuck in front of the crossfire
____ in reality
Happily ever after is some bullshit, it's fairytale bullshit
I want it but it's hopeless (Passing me by)

[Verse 3:]
And now these tears saturate the salty flavor of my lifestyle
Never take my hood off, lonely living with the lights out
Life is like a child ____ staring at my essence
Never let the lights revolve (Never) around the feeling or its presence
This is why, we're taking all the pictures in my mind
Trying to find my way away from it, never letting it die, I
Try to relieve it, leaving it feeing, and never retrieve it, I
Try to relieve it, releasing the meaning, and love and its reason, why
Try? Life is not a battle to be won
I'm sick of fighting for a reason and squeezing it 'till it's done
It's time to let go, it's time to ride into the sunset
It's time to find reality and milk it 'till it runs red
I wonder, but maybe that's excessive
Maybe I should stop trying to fight it and accept it
But letting it go is harder than expected, I admit it
So now I sit and write and try and ride into the distance

[Chorus:]x2
Why's this happening?
Love is slowly molded into tragedy
Stuck in front of the crossfire
____ in reality
Happily ever after is some bullshit, it's fairytale bullshit
I want it but it's hopeless (Passing me by)

Grieves:
You know
It seems hopeless sometimes
Y'know I don't even know
I tried, y'know, honestly
It's whatever, it's done
One love
