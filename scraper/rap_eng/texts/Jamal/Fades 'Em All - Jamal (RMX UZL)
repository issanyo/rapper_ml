[Intro: Big Deiv]
La música me sacó de altos mambos
Yo solo se lo que hice y con quien ando
La música me sacó de altos mambos
Yo solo se lo que hice y con quien ando

[Jamal Verse]
To tha beat ya'll... to tha beat ya'll
...I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch...
See I done chalked up another one
When I drop a ton
Bring your favorite MC
And bring the light like the sun
Get done/bow down I be the one known to rock rhymes
Wit lines beyond yours
To make it primetime
I'm the master of the ceremony Mally G
And it'll be a long day before you see another me
I be high in the clouds
Wit the system pumpin loud
Trippin love in life it's the illest juvenile
Wit my nigga Red/runnin up in
Your spot wit enough dick for you and a friend
So kill a ass we for those who huff
And make you want to kill a nigga
After takin one puff..
Wit the stuff/shit is tough
But all stress takes away
From the Tanqueary murder in my way hay..
Young world peep my method of madness
Watch it bring sadness
Because its that thirl
It's me against the world(Now who the fuck)
Want to see Jamal I fades em all
I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch
I gets mad wreck when wreck is the concept
Stickin tecs to fake niggas necks when they flex
For those that don't know about my flows
Let me introduce
I'm ear tight plus pack a deuce deuce
I'm 5 feet 5 inches
I serve the best of the lyricsts
I come swiff..Def Squad soloist
I be the illest realest gettin bust shorties
Rollin wit Reggie smokin blunts & drinkin 40's
I'm rippin out the frame wit information
When I unleash shit
I dust em off like creation
(when its on its on)say word bind
Word bind on his momma and his..and his kids
I represent the east where niggas ill..Fuck peace
All the shit you talkin nigga
That will get yo ass deceased
Murder..haven't you heard a what I be poppin
When I do ill shit I only represent my home
Its P-H-I double the L, why
When I'm in Newark, North 18th
Hittim double I
Now sigh in relief 'cause y'all can't see me
I be the luniest little ass MC
Now...when I drop my format I mak yo brains go splat
From what I pack niggas gots to react
