King The Goat- verse 1

Forget you I ain’t want a feature anyway
Another wack rapper signed to be on my dinner plate
No diss from you could ever end the great
It’s yo neck thrust my knife then I penetrate
You don’t need no air to ventilate
I’m superior my future looking good like him and Drake
I’m a king don’t need a choppa to intimidate
All I need is for my verses to disintegrate
All these rappers I’m gone assimilate
I got to be good so I can end debates
All these new rappers talking bout pushing drugs through the interstate
I’m the only one who wasn’t
I’m the only one who doesn’t
I won’t shoot at you and yo cousins
I’ll just pull up on you lyrically
Put in big words so these other rappers fearing me
Actually say something so the old heads hearing me
I’m on top of the charts ain’t nobody even nearing me

Jamal

I am a heavy hitter da harder hitter my fist bigger, fist of metal sorta like I was da surfer of silver, but dey not silver dey gold like dey got touched my mitus, I'll hit u put to sleep like you had caught da ightus, but in all actuality u caught iridosiklitis, n u can't even hide it, so don't you even try it, sorry for being so violent, u jus got to excited, so I had to make u go silent, my goal wasn't to make you start crying, cause you had an eye dat was so vibrantly violet, I was out of control my fist went auto pilot, oh look what I did man I done caused riot, eating all of dees beats like I had a vegan diet, killing all of dees beats like i had a demon inside me, but there ain't no demon inside me, it's something holy inside me, and I ain't talking da biblical spiritual, I'm talking bout da metaphorical, relating to da physical

Metaphorically changing my metamorphosis, morphing into a planet, and going into an orbit, each year I'm getting stronger the sun's energy I absorb it, fighting until da last second your never seeing me forfeit, I am a profit, who is profound, a profound profit properly pronouncing dees pronouns, u other rappers need to get wit the program

King The Goat- verse 2

Don’t mess with me when I’m at my darkest
Yo head a bullseye ima make sure my dart hit
On the track I be the sharpest
If I stood in yo face you would be harmless
Ohh that’s not true let me test yo hardness
Now fall back into the darkness
Mr Steal yo soul yeah I’ll make a man heartless
Stab him I’ll leave his carcass in the Arctic
Or sell his body in the market
