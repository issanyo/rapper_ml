You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law
You have the right to an attorney
If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you
Do you understand these rights that have just been read to you?

[Verse 1: Chip I.T.]

'93 is when I got the spark inside of me
Miranda Rights and since you testified to the defeat
Troubles on my mind, I supply, you defy

I roll with my Royce, snagging bags, playing tag
Eating rappers while I'm on my lunch break
Can I get some Doritos in this bitch?
Nah, that violates parole, ya bish

Yellow tape makes me shiver at my wake
When I see blood, I begin to feel awake
Ache, my pain. Feel like Sweet Baby Ray's
Shower me with some rhythematic sway, hey

I blow eighths, set dates, investigate
With the need to set the streets straight, bitch, I'm A-rate
Copping blow, let the beat roll
We got this one under control

[Verse 2: Blair]

So I was chilling on the corner right
Walking around doing things on a stormy night
Got the call that I had to go in and pick him up
Had to save the President’s life in the midget truck

Three possible suspects, all plotting heavy
Man you got to believe me homie, they got machetes
Tracked them down, one by one, caught them red-handed
Saw him reaching for the poison at the Med Campus

Two flashes of lightning, and then he disappeared
My walkie-talkie screaming, “Get that agent out of here”
Had to call and make sure that I warned the Head of the State
That if he went and made this speech he’d have his head on a plate

I wasn't hesitant to say, "you’re getting led into your grave
But if you'll let me just explain I'll keep the pretadors at bay"
Saw snipers getting set to aim, and at his head they were finna spray
I used the legendary ray gun and the pellets ricocheted

Got the kennel sniffing away, they can smell a criminal face
Dogs was yelping in disarray,  found the felons getting away
I arrested them instantly, went and left to go hit the hay
Got the medal winning the case, now the Presidents sitting safe

I really did it

[Hook: Blair & Howie D]

Pulling up to the curb (yeah that’s right), yeah we hit the streets
Walking round, let it knock, let it bang, we finna eat
Yo you cracked the case? Man you already know
Invest the dough, wash our hands, and let the fetti grow

[Verse 3: Jamal]
Around the rosie's seven posies where the body's found
Sentimental statements made so they find common ground
Somebody better clear things up before we all go down
Like the plague and don't be vague cops might be coming down
His wife, her dad, his wife, bridesmaid, best friend and victims parents
All stand haunted in a circle confusedly staring
The tiny chance of an infection does concern them all
But the skin shows zero signs so it's no worm at all
Only parasitic humans could take claim of this fall
So they spar amongst themselves in constant verbal brawls
Now lets recall the man was like the star of the beatles
With two r's, he had a rhythmic way of leading people
So only one of envy could commit such an evil
And make this precious everlasting look like something feeble
Before this trip every person had a bone to pick
With our victim so it's no surprise he cease to live
Sworn secrecy, indecency he sought his wife a rose
In the woods, one gripped his neck so he'd forever doze
And seven days after the couple seemed to settle down
Around the rosie's seven posies where the body's found




[Verse 4: Howie D]

Yo where I'm from, people drink they saliva when they thirsty
Sticks and stones don't break bones but words'll hurt me
Y'all ain't heard me. My Words Worthy, my streets murky
And Jesus is the only one around who shows mercy
Like he in a Lamborghini with Paul riding shotgun
Moses in the back screaming, "Judas, you don't want none!
As long as the Truth is in the drivers seat, you can't run
No false prophets or false Gods, He is the top one"
Uh, no shuckin' and jivin', no ducking and hiding
From the evil one I'm running from, no shying and crying
And if you deciding to look for me, you better come quiet
Cause the saints that I run with will start a Heavenly riot
It's Howie!
So catch me if you can Leonardo
Decapitate ya captain, he won't make it far as I go
Toe to toe, blow for blow, I meet my rivals
With a shield of faith and helmet of salvation for survival
