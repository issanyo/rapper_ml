Like that, welcome to the brand new world bitch, put it on them like this, from the motherfucking home girl in the house to be new trip world and it’s the P-A-S-S-I-O-N

[Passion]
See I be flipping like Tina
Turning with a burner
Running through your hood yelling lyrical murder
It's dark outside and these niggas try to hide
I glide through your crew like glide to glide
I ain't letting shit ride
Watcha wanna do?
When I come for you and your bitch ass crew
Strap nine lose your mind on the verge of destruction
Blood starts to boil you like a lyrical combustion
Eruption it ain't no pressure no pain
Niggas falling off the strain the maintain
I got the cream team and gunning for the riches (riches)
So many wack bitches posing for pictures (pictures)
Everyday same papers
I regulate my papers, cause so many spectators trying to imitate us
They be walking by walking
Mocking my persona
They wanna be like passion but they don’t want the drama
They be killing me trying to preach to me
Teach to me, I got the p.h.d in funkology
You got your blasters and your masters of the field of dramatic attic
The lyrical one bringing the static from the attic
So cock your automatic I’ve had it up to here
You niggas are in danger you better stand clear up no love and notice mainstream America they just stay ready for this

[The D.O.C.]
Nigga didn’t wanna pass the weed
Left me stuck
Everybody be telling me Daz fucked up
But I never gave a fuck though
It’s all about the cash or you walk the river like trash
And I’m about to get a brand new
One puff puff it really don’t matter cause now I got the batter
Now sticking it in my sock
Jet straight hit the dope spot bet
No just us just me in Atlanta where you wanna come and test me
Real the real new whatcha wanna do
Cause all I got to say is all arcade
Put it another way of criminal
You could be the original mark of bliminal wiminal
Get wet
Can’t forget my niggas in the lake Westside project
On the line
Once upon a time in C.A
I met five niggas all they did was bomb shit
I mixed
The completely leet technique
Together with the knowledge of a Compton street
But weak Nigga fucked up mo town
One by one everybody broke down
I’m out it’s about money cash but me
I’m about to do a Jordan on that ass

Yeah one time for your mind do a motherfucker like that Mally G

[Mally G aka Jamal from Illegal]
I got my eye on the motherfucker coming out the back
Cause that trick bitch wanna see me on the track
And it’s so good that they want it like that
Cause I’m a Nigga bro
And kick the trigger flow
Screaming 6-1 to the grave
Big drug sellers
Bitches and money you can’t a motherfucking tell
Em a thang about this gang Philadelphia niggas got to let the gats bang
We come equipped with Glocks and flips in the pocket
And straight lock shit
And that’s the way it’s gonna be
From 95 until infinity Mally G
I beat that loony ass nigga landpin'
And now I give a fuck who the fuck
Is ???
I scream my shit I love my shit
Fuck flipping positive I get my living negative
Motherfucker it don’t stop ha and my Nigga erotic got it
???on deck what motherfucker
He got the track weed and the set
I drop it on the one for my dogs who was with me y’all
Keep it tight for a Nigga don’t forget me y’all
See I got my niggas and we got guns
And beats like that we always stay strapped
I represent the Philly four pound
Pack be quick to smack a tramp bitch jaw jack a felon like hard jack is flipping my thing down
With my Nigga erotic
What you want next
And the D and to the O-C
With the lunatic lyricist its mally g
The unfuck with the full individual
Leaving mc’s in the condition that will be critical
Ha and niggas know
That I don’t give a fuck about a trick ass ho
Never trick in my dough
And that’s the way it’s gonna be
From 95 till infinity its mally g
