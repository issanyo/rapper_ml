Hook:
"Cause long as I'm alive I'mma live illegal" (x4)

Verse 1:
Take it to another level of mic murdering
I'm dippin' off the bom bom zee it seems to me lifes slipped
Yeah it's kind of hard not trippin' on these phoney MC's
I'm a resort to gun grippin', blastin' killin' niggas
Jamal is the real raw dog bill a nigga
So many motherfuckers rappin', yappin' about scrappin'
Marley use to strappin' bust in caps
And dust 'em al off nigga break north
Fuck these bitch ass niggas cause they all soft
Fakin' moves over hoes
Switch they dress code and mode
And now they wanna impore, up in the game
But I'm a blow they ass out the frame
And do it for my niggas fuck the money and the fame

Hook

Verse 2:
Mally G drop the sickedest rhymes are the wickedest
Beat to the many motherfuckers that can get with this
Peep how I demolish, abuse fools that run up on me
I'm gettin' busy by my lonely
For the 9 nickle I'm a get ill like sickle
Cell anemia when I be gettin' technicle
On the M.I.C. I represent and kill shit
Fuck the stressin' I only spit real shit
And niggas best to recognize no time for bullshittin'
Keep your eyes on the prize
So what I'm after is long term like satin
Everlastin' weed and it's all guarenteed
For me to wreck shop on behalf of my people
As long as I'm alive I'mma live illegal
