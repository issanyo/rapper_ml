(Intro) Langston
Have you ever wished you can turn the hands of the clock so just to go back in the past and undo all the mistakes you did? Hope is all that l have left,but l will always be there to hold you close when you're feeling cold, to caress you when you feeling that typa way, l'm here to love you and will always be here. l love you

(Verse 1)
L had you l lost you
L had to move on though
L gave it all my best but nothing ever came through
We never had to
Put it in the trash can
Cause now l'm digging deep just to find that lost love
You told me that you love me now you're saying we're friends
The feelings that we have and the moments that we shared
The words that you said and the promises we made
The curtain is now down bae l know l was bad
You told me "nothing last forever good things come to an end
From friends to dust from lovers to friends"
The sound of your voice still echoes in my head
The picture of your face is always what l see
Babe nothing lasts forever but this time we're forever
Nothing is bigger than those moments we're together
We be loving
We be touching
We be singing
We be different
Cause you different now lm different
When you're far, We loving

(Chorus)
L love what l had for the future is unheard
L had stuff on my mind which l couldn't understand
You came in my life and made me understand
You made me realise what l couldn't comprehend
Without you
L couldn't comprehend without you
L couldn't comprehend without you
L couldn't comprehend without you
L couldn't comprehend without you

(Verse 2)
Babe take my hand we can conquer the world
Let's paint off the past and the future will be fine
The pastures will be greener ain't nobody can defy
L love you so deep l know no words that can describe
Can walk through hell with a smile on my face
Just take my hand and put a smile on this face
Let's make it through the night with you by my side
Now l'm down on my knees listen to what l have to say
Wishing that that hennesy
Will put away those memories
Put away those dirty lies we all don't wanna get dirty right
All we did was live and fight
Living on the edge of life
You told me that time was tight, you made me feel like all was right
Drifted away
You couldn't stay
Day but it was dark and l couldn't believe
L couldn't resist
The love l ever knew just walking away now lm down on knees saying
