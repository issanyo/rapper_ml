[Malik]
Yo, check it out
Coming right back at you
With another slamming hit
Illegal in the motherfuckin house
With Erick Sermon, takin over in the 90's, youknowhatI'msayin?
E-Double on the solo tip
And this how we gonna do it
We gettin buzy on this track
Aiyyo, check it
Do ya like this

Malik'll play the lawnmover, and Kris'll play the grass
I just ate MC's, cause why? ABC whipped!
Illegal cuts that ass, the way that I will punch you
Wouldn't think I was a kid G, that's why I took the time out
To say that I gets buzy, like Dizzy, Gillespie
So suckers stretch your eyes, but you still couldn't see me
Now, skippidy-doo-dah, di-di-di da-di-day
I don't need no permission, I still come out and play
To Uncle Sam I say, "Scram!" Say my numbers aren't enough
But to get wreck with the army, all I have to be is rough
And tough, and no need to lie about my age
Just get fly with my tongue, and go on a rampage
I'm going off, because it's Little Malik
And no sucker, it's not all about maturity
Now if you want beef, fuck it, cause a fuss
And no, little kids, this ain't nothin for Da Youngsta's
Ya can't even see me
It's no relation, so we can't run in the family
Yeah, and I'm still the boss
Cause I'm a straight up nigga, ain't nothin bout me Kris Kross...
... you little rejects
I have the intellect to get respect, I'm gettin wreck
Don't even try to scam, because you're no threat to me
Can't write ya own rhymes, sellin Jermaine's life stories
Chorus: (*repeats in background*

I getz buzy
I getz buzy on this track, cause I getz buzy
Malik getz buzy on this track, cause I getz buzy
Malik getz buzy on this track, cause I getz buzy
Malik getz buzy on this track

[Jamal]
I getz buzy with my shit, you shouldn't shoulda fucked with me
I'm not a ordinary kid it's the Illegal shit G
And with Malik, my shit'll be pumpin, you're punkin
You step out ?like the fuck in it? just like a pumpkin
Swingin bolos, and buckin buckshots
So when you look in the mirror, it be Illegal on your knots
So my advice to you is fade, stay out my way
Cause I'm a young bull on a rampage, I don't play
Damn them boys are dope and my rhymes and crews are fat
Check out my ryhmes, and now check my gat
Because I'm always strapped pack with a loaded rhyme
And steppin niggas get knocked off, from here to Zimbabwe, out
Cause I ain't havin that shit, in ninety-three
Cause if you fuck with this shit, you gotta fuck with Malik, uh-huh
You call me pussy, come and play you get fucked
But if your britches get burned, I call ya shit out of luck

Chorus: (*repeats in background*
"For all of y'all, keepin y'all in health" --] Slick Rick)

I getz buzy y'all
Jamal getz buzy on this track, I getz buzy
I getz buzy on this track, Jamal getz buzy
I getz buzy on this track, I getz buzy
Jamal getz buzy on this track

[Erick Sermon]
Ahhhhh, make me wanna holla ("RRAAAAAOOWWW!") scream like Busta
And get down, get down, from 'You a Customer'
Cocaine hit, E-Double the shit, yo
I'm swifter than Flash when I'll be cracking that black ass
Like this, my style's mackadocious
And rumpshaking, like the bumba claat Jamaican
Who can see me? My rap format is cock diezel
When I be rockin with Illegal
It Smells Like Teen Spirit, but not Nirvana's
It's real hip-hop music, like Afrika Bambaata's
So step off, heeyyyyyyy, heyyyyyyy
Yo it's the E-R-I-C-K yo...

Chorus: (*repeats in background*
"For all of y'all, keepin y'all in health" --] Slick Rick)

I'm gettin buzy y'all
I'm gettin buzy on this track, I getz buzy
Erick getz buzy on this track, I getz buzy
Erick getz buzy on this track, I getz buzy
Erick getz buzy on this track
