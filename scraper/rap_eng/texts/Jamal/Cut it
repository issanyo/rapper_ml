Take all that money and take all those hundreds put it on your mouth and bet on your grind
Take all your chains and take all those cars and just spin that dice and bet on your talent

CUT IT!*****8

(VERSE 1)

Switching l'm switching, ndiri mdhara vapfanha
Flying l'm flying, the sky is no limit
Slaying l'm slaying ndakiller matsaga
An X on my feat and Respeck on  my name
Hold it now hold it now l tellem to stop it and they are stuck in the moment so l tellem to CUT
Counting my blessings they doubling and tripling
Lm counting your loses and l'm lost in the count
Wanted a fight now they tell me to hold
Going so hard now they tell me to stop
Went for a movie with my bae and her pops
Popping P-corns yet l'm popping some bottles
Went for some green with my friends from the hood
Coughing they tripping, they singing they syncing
Voom Voom sound of a truck
Scrull scrull the truck now stuck
Nation wide l'm the real deal
And l ain't stopping right now
Filla maFilla you catching feelings
All the way up, NO CEILINGS!
Touchdown thats a highscore
Turned up till your rentz call
Follow me better be my goon
Seke we good, thats my hood

(HOOK)
Take all that money and take all those hundreds put it on your mouth and bet on your grind
Take all your chains and take all those cars and just spin that dice and bet on your talent
L turn up we turned up we check on that turn up they loving the vibe cause brother WE GOT IT!
Micasa Picasa my hittas be bawling that shawty be  stalking but l ain't gonna...
CUT IT!*****8

(Verse 2)
Cut it and cut it now cut it and cut it
Nda slicer masinger akufunga akurapper
Wishing you wishing you stuck in your dreams
Grinding and winning l'm living your dreams
Power and the fame yeah mama l made it
Love to my ex and i hope i mean it
Hopes going down
Six feet under
Knock you down
Bang bang bang bang
Take all that money  and take all those hundreds and put it on your mouth and bet on your grind
Ndapinda ndavetwa matsaga onditeta matsaga ondizeza ndini one anoketa
Skippa da flippa the sound of a winner
Skipping and flipping you non but a loser
Magazaralli the heat is just rising the cool is fading
So you gonna
Run Titi boy
Run Titi boy
Scared of a lil homie
Run Titi boy run Titi boy
L told you l'm the real deal
You're faking
You wanna be like me right?
Why you slacking?
