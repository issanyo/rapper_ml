(Intro)
Done did a lotta things lm regretting.....lm born again now
Shout out SwaeMoss, Sir-Lexy Mc Chocho


(Chorus)
Used to party all night
Smocking that kush man l thought it was tight
(tight, tight, tight)
Fresh born again now l know whats right
Party all night
Living in darkness now made it to the light
(light, light, light)
Fresh born again now l know whats tight
Party all night

(VERSE 1)
Party all night
L did a  couple things that my mama didn't like
Smocking kush drinking liquor but mama 'lm back
Mama lm stronger like l never ever have been
Party all night
Used to chase after woman
Chase after Mula then spend it on bottles
Nothing was right
Nothing was straight and l always regret
Being that kid in the block with 4 8 roll
Smocking kush by the corner looking for the Popo
Swaggering around with some fake yellow girls
Then put them indoors and turn them 2 on
Most of my nights l never spend  at home
Steal a couple bucks just to buy a new phone
Used to make you wanna cry
Make you feel like a losing but mama you are a winner
Mama l'm back now

(Chorus)
Used to party all night
Smocking that kush man l thought it was tight
(tight, tight, tight)
Fresh born again now l know whats right
Party all night
Living in darkness now made it to the light
(light, light, light)
Fresh born again now l know whats tight

(Verse 2)
Day 1 l'm grinding
Day 2 l'm grinding
My dad wasn't around so l was the man of the house
Back in the day
L had a way
Of making money in a blink but it was never great
Used to thug kubvira kudhara vonditora vondivharira
Rudo rwamhamha vainditora vondimbundira
Zvese zvandida vaindibvunza vondiitira
And here l stand  just make it all better
Used to party all night...
...Smocking a doobie just all of my life
Hell of a life...
My dreams were blurred
The decisions were twisted
The life that l lived man it was all blinded
The world is around with my footstool as the ground
Mama always told me not to look back never
Now l'm stronger and better, Eb- Ebenezer

(Chorus)
Used to party all night
Smocking that kush man l thought it was tight
(tight, tight, tight)
Fresh born again now l know whats right
Party all night
Living in darkness but made it to the light
(light, light, light)
Fresh born again now l know whats tight
