[Intro]
1, 2, 3

[Verse]
Girl, You’re the medicine patch that slowly eases my motion sickness
Wherever I go I’ll have it under my ear
The time it takes to fall for you takes 3 seconds
But I feel as though you’re the meaning of my eternity
I see visions of you on the tv screen, bathroom mirror, and the sun
What’s going on, I want to avoid you but I can’t
Actually, it’s not that I want to avoid you
In fact, I can’t rationalize myself
Put your thoughts away and just give me a hug, give me a hug
Put your expensive title of ‘hard to get’ down for today

[Refrain 1]
Take it off now girl just take it off
I’m a master, baby with your bra
Take it off now girl just take it off
I can help you slide those panties off

[Refrain 2]
Dim the lights down baby, dim the lights
I’m a beat that pussy like you never ever felt before
We gonna double your heart great form lady, just dim the lights
I’m a beat that pussy like you never ever felt before
Dim the lights down baby, dim the lights
I’m a beat that pussy like you never ever felt before
We gonna double your heart great form lady, just dim the lights
I’m a beat that pussy like you never ever felt before
Baby
