Korean Original
[Verse]
Listen
넌 내가 안쓰럽대 방탄소년단
이 하나에 다 걸었다고, 버렸다고 몇 년 간
그래 물 밑에서 날 고까워했던 그 Underground
마저 외면한 채 찢어버렸던 내 처녀막
The only issue is 난 날 보인 적 없지
The real realm in me, You never know what it is
시작 때부터 인정받은 골수 천재
왜 내 이름이 RapMonster일까 (뻔해)
돌 때 집었던 연필을 신이 내게 주셨던 운명
난 그게 공분줄 알았지만 어린 내 착각이었어 분명
난 가사들을 적었고 밤새도록 날 쓰려 해석해
넌 넌 대체 뭘 했지? 계산기처럼 Say my name
Bitches will say my name, 내가 혜성처럼 데뷔한 뒤에
Y'all get it on 따라와봐 난 Rap할게
전부 떨어진 감들뿐 여긴 다 물러터졌어
내가 좆같다고? 그래 난 건드릴수록 커져 더

[Outro]
Yeah
The glory
Give it to me
Yeah wassup
Get it
The glory
Give it to me
Yeah
Imma get my glory
Give it to me
Yeah

English Translation
[Verse]
Listen
You say that I’m pathetic
Said I staked everything on this one thing, BTS
You said I threw away those years away
That's right, the underground that left cruel comments about me under my songs
And the rest of them that ignored me, they tore my hymen
The only issue is I've never shown you me
The real realm in me, you’ll never know what it is
From the start, I was acknowledged as a genius to the bone
Why would my name be Rap Monster? (it’s obvious)
The pencil that I grabbed during my first birthday is the fate that God gave me
I thought that it was for studying, but it was a young misunderstanding for sure
I stayed up all night working to translate myself into lyrics
What the hell did you do? Like a calculator, say my name
Bitches will say my name after I debut like a comet
Y’all get it on, try to follow me, I’ll rap
All just fallen persimmons, it’s all soft and burst here
You say I'm a dick? Yeah, that's right, as you mess with me, I get bigger

[Outro]
Yeah
The glory
Give it to me
Yeah, what’s up
Get it
The glory
Give it to me
Yeah
Imma get my glory
Give it to me
Yeah
