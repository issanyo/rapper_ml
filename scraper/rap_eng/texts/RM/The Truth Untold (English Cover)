I woke up in a castle
In a blossoming garden
Feeling so lonely
Mmm
I hung myself
In this mess
Filled with thorns

Tell me what do they call you?
Where are you running off to?
Oh could you tell me?
Mmm
I found you hidden away in this garden

And I know your warmth is
The closest to reality
The flowers that you picked for me
Reaching for your hand

But this is my fate
Don't smile on me
Light on me
No I can never take another step to you
Don't have a name to call me by anymore

You know that I can't
Show you me
Give you me
The weaknesses that I
Hide you can never see
I’m wearing a mask again so I can see you

But I still want you

Wanna give you a flower
From this lonesome garden
Reminding me of you
Mmm
I'd give you all and take
This foolish mask off

But I know, that I can
Never give you more than that
Forever may be in the past
Hide the ugly now

Cause I'm so afraid
That in the end
You'll leave again
It may be sad, but what
Was I supposed to do?
I’m wearing a mask
Again so I can see you

I'm crying my soul out
I'm all alone
These walls won't hold
The castle made of sand
Is falling from stone
I'm taking off the
Mask to go and see you

But I still want you
And I still want you

Ooh ooh ooh

Maybe back then
If i was brave
I’d show you me
We could finally be happy
Young wild and free
I'd give you all and take
This foolish mask off

But my heart is breaking
Falling deeply
The castle made of sand
Has fallen from within
I throw away my mask and see it sinking

But I still want you
