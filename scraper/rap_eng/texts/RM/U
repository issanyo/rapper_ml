HANGUL
[Verse 1: Kwon Jin Ah]
뭘 그리 고민하는지 말이 없던 너
왜 이리 애가 타는지 알려줄래?
이 맘을 알긴 아는지
혹시 기다리고 있는지
그래 그런지도 모르지 tell me baby

[Verse 2: Kwon Jin Ah]
Lookin' out my room window
난 너만 보고 있지 또
저기 하늘에 별 같아
너는 멀고도 가깝다
너만 기다릴 거야 나 baby say it’s true
오늘은 어쩜 네게 이 말을 해버릴지 몰라

[Chorus: Kwon Jin Ah]
You, yes it is you, oh, it is you, yeah
이게 사랑이란 걸까
You, oh it is you, only you, yeah

[Verse 3: Kwon Jin Ah]
오늘은 왠 일인지 이 길에 끝에
혼자 걷는 너를 볼 것 같애
바람이 좀 차가워 손도 조금 시려워
근데 니가 더 그리워 where you at, babe
누가 나를 부르면 다 니 목소리 같아 난
너가 귓가에 맴돌아 자꾸 내 귀를 따라와
이젠 조급해져 가 oh baby cause it’s true
넌 나를 어쩜 이리도 간절하게 하는 걸까

[Chorus: Kwon Jin Ah]
You, yes it is you, oh, it is you, yeah
이게 사랑이란 걸까
You, oh it is you, only you, yeah
It’s always been you

[Verse 4: Rap Monster]
너의 밑줄이 될게 넌 중요하니까
너의 이름이 내 다잉 메시지가 될 거야
등등 etc 로맨틱한 말은 수없이
생각했지만 한 번도 검사 받아본 적이 없지
내 일상에 자꾸만 피쳐링 중인 너
이건 내 솔로 앨범이야 왜 모든 곡에 끼어들어
You keep on scratchin', you rappin, you beatin my whole life
뭐 고백 같은 거? 아이 몰라
외로움과 같이 누우면 침대가 자꾸 넓어져
아무리 자꾸 뒹굴어봐도 lonely
Cause your lips and your thighs and your everything fine
넌 나랑 어울려 I want your everything mine
Oh shit 원래 이런 사람 아닌데
너란 미로 앞에 바보가 되네
자꾸 길을 잃어도 어차피 내 목적진 정해져 있어
넌 destination, destiny고 definition

[Chorus: Kwon Jin Ah]
You, yes it is you, oh, it is you, yeah
이게 사랑이란 걸까
You, oh it is you, only you, yeah
난 너만 바라봐 oh
You, yes it is you, oh, it is you
언제까지나 yeah
You, yes it is you, oh, it is you
You

[Verse 1: Kwon Jin Ah]
What are you thinking about? You’re so quiet
Will you tell me what’s making you so anxious?
Do you even know how I feel? Are you waiting?
Yeah, maybe that’s it, tell me baby

[Verse 2: Kwon Jin Ah]
Lookin’ out my room window, I’m only looking at you again
You’re like the stars in the sky, so far yet so close
I will only wait for you, baby say it’s true
I might tell you this today

[Chorus: Kwon Jin Ah]
You, yes it is you oh it is you yeah
Is this what love is?
You, oh it is you only you yeah

[Verse 3: Kwon Jin Ah]
For some reason, at the end of the road
I think I’ll see you, walking alone
The wind is a little cold, my hands are a little cold too
But I miss you even more, where you at babe
When someone calls me, it sounds like your voice
You linger around my ears, you keep following my ears
Now I’m getting impatient, oh baby cause it’s true
How can you make me feel so desperate?

[Chorus: Kwon Jin Ah]
You, yes it is you oh it is you yeah
What should I say?
You, oh it is you only you yeah
It’s always been you

[Verse 4: Rap Monster]
I’ll be your underline because you’re important
I’ll make your name my dying message
I can’t say romantic things like that
I’ve thought about it but I’ve never been checked
You keep featuring in my daily life
This is my solo album, why do you keep interfering in every track?
You keep on scratchin, you rappin, you beatin my whole life
Confessing my love? I don’t know
When I lay down with loneliness, my bed keeps getting bigger
No matter how much I roll around, it’s lonely
Cuz your lips and your thighs and your everything fine
You look good with me, I want your everything mine
Oh shit, I’m not usually like this
But I become a fool in your maze
I keep getting lost but my destination is set on you anyway
You’re my destination, destiny and definition

[Chorus: Kwon Jin Ah]
You, yes it is you oh it is you
I think I love you
You, yes it is you oh it is you
I’m only looking at you oh
You, yes it is you oh it is you
For always yeah
You, yes it is you oh it is you
You
