[RM의 Favorite Girl 가사]

시간이 많이 흘렀지 girl
몇년 전 그 때 입버릇처럼 말했던 I’ll show you the whole world
홍대 곳곳 다 구경시켜주겠다고
어린 맘에 나만 딱 믿어보라고
지나치게 조심스러웠던 그 성격 탓에
그렇게 시간은 야속하게 도망쳤고
정신없이 살다보니 뚜렷했던 너 역시
추억의 뒤안길로 스러져갔어
사랑이라는 게 다 그런 건가봐
사람이라는 게 다 그런 건가봐
그치만 여전히 가끔 생각이 나
그저 못다한 미련일 뿐일까

Oh my..
You’re, you’re my favorite girl
You’re still my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl
As time passes by I will forget my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl

너에게 더이상 해가 되기 싫어서
어두운 밤에만 떠오르는 달이 됐어
아무도 모르게 다 잠이 든 새벽엔
색바랜 니 편지를 품에 안곤 해
까만 펜으로 꾹꾹 눌러 쓴 그 글자들 위로
안개처럼 펼쳐지는 기억들
너도 날 가끔 그리워할까
니가 내게 불러줬던 노랠 듣다가
왠지 니가 하고 싶었던 말같아서
괜히 울컥해, 멀어진 너를 알아도
가끔 궁금해져 우린 왜 이렇게 됐을까
뭐땜에 피지도 못하고 져야만 했을까

You’re, you’re my favorite girl
You’re still my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl
As time passes by I will forget my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl

그땐 그렇게 말했지만
그게 진심은 아니야
그땐 그렇게 멈췄지만
그게 진심은 아니야
그땐 그렇게 참았지만
그게 진심은 아니야
그땐 그렇게 웃었지만
그게 진심은 아니야

You’re, you’re my favorite girl
You’re still my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl
As time passes by I will forget my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl

[English Translation]

A lot of time has passed girl
As I said some years before, at that moment, I’ll show you the whole world
Hongdae, here and there, I said that I’ll show you all
Just like a child’s heart, try to just believe in me
Because of that excessive cautious personality
Like that, the time escaped heartlessly
You, of course, tried to live without much thought
The memories’ disappeared into the mists of history
Like the love was something like that
Like the love was something like that
But sometimes I still remember
Maybe they’re just some unfinished foolish days

Oh my…
You’re, you’re my favorite girl
You’re still my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl
As time passes by I will forget my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl

You didn’t want to do it anymore
Just in the dark nights the moon rises
Without knowing a thing, I fall asleep in the dawn
Putting the faded letter you wrote to me in my arms
On top of those words written with a black pen
Those mist-like memories
I wonder if you sometimes miss me too
Listening to the song you used to sing to me
Why does it seem that it said what you wanted to say?
Without a reason, without control, even if you who are far know it
Sometimes I wonder why both of us ended like this
Without even being able to listen for some reason, being responsible

You’re, you’re my favorite girl
You’re still my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl
As time passes by I will forget my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl
Even if I said it like that back then
I didn’t say it for real
Even if I stopped like that back then
It wasn’t for real
Even if I restrained myself back then
It wasn’t for real
Even if I laughed like that back then
It wasn’t for real

You’re, you’re my favorite girl
You’re still my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl
As time passes by I will forget my favorite favorite girl
My favorite favorite girl
