English Translation
[RM] Do you think we can reach #1?
[Suga] Well, not getting caught up in being #1 or whatever, I really like the album itself. The album is good. I like the song.
[RM] I can’t be satisfied by the album now. We have to get #1.
[Jin] Yeah.
[J-Hope] Hey, but don’t have expectations.
[RM] No, but I, end up having expectations.
[V] Me, me too.
[Jimin] As for me, I don’t know what to think. Sungdeuk-ssaem told us before about how we started, and stuff. I don’t know if I should really be hopeful or not. I don’t know what to think.
[V] Honestly...
[J-Hope] I’m not expecting anything.
[V] To be honest, just because you say ‘Don’t expect anything’, doesn’t mean we expect nothing.
[Jin] Yeah, me too. I just start being hopeful.
[Suga] Hey, out of the stuff I heard, wait, I’m saying the same thing as before. Really, I’m scared that we expect something and... get nothing.
[J-Hope] Actually, the funny thing is that the songs that I didn’t expect anything from got big… To be honest, I wasn’t expecting much from "No More Dream". Really.
[Suga] Wait, no, you–
[Rap Monster] Just don’t expect anything.
[Suga] No, you said you got a feel for "No More Dream".
[V] You did say that in the beginning.
[J-Hope] Well, it’s impossible for me not to get a feel. I kind of feel for it’ll do well or not do well…
[RM] What?
[J-Hope] I did say stuff like that, but I didn’t expect anything big. Even "N.O."
[V] Ah, "N.O."
[RM] You had big expectations for "N.O.", huh?
[J-Hope] Because we had that image at first and it kind of–
[RM] Had a good response.
[J-Hope] Yeah, it got a good image, so I was hopeful.
[V] So you had big expectations.
[J-Hope] But it kind of–
[V] It totally–
[J-Hope] I didn’t expect anything for "Boy In Luv".
[V] It totally failed.
[J-Hope] But I had a lot of expectations for "Danger".
[Jin] Hey, so do you have high expectations for this song?
[J-Hope] Ah, I said I had none.
[Jin] Ah, great! Good, good, good!
[RM] You’re BTS’ Pelé, huh? Hey, just think that we’re totally gonna fail.
[Jin] Yeah. Just totally.
[J-Hope] Our odd-numbered releases do well.
[Jungkook] Ah, but can underage people also file for tax deductions?
[V] What are you talking about?
[Suga and RM] What are you talking about? Why are you suddenly saying that? Why? Why do you want to know?
[Jungkook] Ah, the outro.
[V] Hey, I wrote the chorus!
[RM] Are you saying because you wrote "Outro", you’re gonna get some profit?
[J-Hope] You’re so young, and you’re already…
[Jin] You 19-year-old. You’re already…
[RM] You’re saying you’re gonna start getting the copyright fees, huh?
[Jungkook] I’m not gonna get allowances from my parents anymore.
[Jin] Ah, this kid…
[RM] Why are you going to file for tax deductions?
[Jungkook] Ah, honestly, it doesn’t really matter…
[Suga] You can only file for tax deductions when you make some money… (Mumbles something about they don’t have to worry about it because they don’t make any)
[Jungkook] To be honest, I was talking to my dad on the phone and he brought tax deductions up..
[J-Hope] This month-
[RM] Ah, because you wrote "Outro", your father said you have to file for tax deductions?
[Jungkook] No, no!
[RM] Your father said so! Father!
[Suga] We don’t make any money!
[J-Hope] Jungkook’s dad!
[Jungkook] No, no, I’m not saying I have to file for tax deductions–
