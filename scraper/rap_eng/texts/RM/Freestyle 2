English Translation
Yo
It's now 6 AM
I’m so tired, I think I'm gonna go insane
Think about it, why did I come here?
Right. It's to be cool like a rap star
But reality is a bit different
The moment I was about to accept this
The company separates us members
And my tears have dried up
Three years have already passed
And time has passed since then
I’ve already become 20
I used to be like a child but now I've become an adult
Some say if you wanna go, you gotta take this slow
You gotta cool it off
Right, this is the dream that I've hungered for all this time
So I must move forward
Because I get tired
Because I've whipped myself this far
But because this is not what I need anymore
Sometimes, I have to take a rest too
I think of this
So I heal myself with music
I heal myself like this
I want to share these emotions with people
If I could, I'd be really happy
My emotions are deep to that extent
It's not superficial
The last 3 years where I did not get to pay back my gratitude to people
Now is the time for me to pay it back
I must love people
I want to share these good feelings with people
I believe I can
I want to heal people and give them strength
I think of that as my job
