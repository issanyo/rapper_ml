[이현의 Bad Girl 가사]

[Lee Hyun]
눈빛만 봐도
나쁜 여잔걸 알 수 있다고
걱정말라고
절대로 빠질 리가 없다고
자신감 있던 나도
여자는 알만큼 알던 나도
그녀는 좀 달랐어
나쁜 줄 알면서 빠져 갔어

Oh She's a bad girl bad girl
내 내가 미치겠어 겠어
Hate that I met her met her
지 지나쳐야 했어 했어

[Jiyeon of GLAM]
Yes I'm a ba bad girl
Ba ba ba ba ba ba bad girl
Yes I'm a ba a a a a a bad girl
Ba ba ba ba ba ba bad girl

[Lee Hyun]
절대 내꺼로
안될 거란 걸 다 알면서도
그냥 날 갖고
놀고 있단 걸 다 알면서도
그냥 그게 좋아서
날 갖고 노는 니가 좋아서
계속 빠져만 갔어
나쁜 줄 알면서 빠져 갔어

Oh She's a bad girl bad girl
내 내가 미치겠어 겠어
Hate that I met her met her
지 지나쳐야 했어 했어

[Jiyeon of GLAM]
Yes I'm a ba bad girl
Ba ba ba ba ba ba bad girl
Yes I'm a ba a a a a a bad girl
Ba ba ba ba ba ba bad girl

[RM of BTS]
Oh this day
마치 그때 너를 첨 만났던
상황과 비슷해
자신감에 가득 차
네게 다가간 건 내 최고의 mistake
I know 난 너의 넓은 어장 안
많고 많은 물고기들 중 하나
허나 나쁜 여자란 게 나를 더
네게 빠지게끔 만드는걸
널 볼 때마다 난 그저 쿵쿵쿵
또 막혀오는 숨숨숨
니 진심을 안 후에야
겨우 벗어나려 애쓰는 중중중
겉으론 bad girl 속은 더 bad girl
Huh 이제는 let me know the real ya
모두 말해줘 내게 널

Even just looking in your eyes
I know you’re a bad girl

Even that me that had confidence
As much as I knew women I knew myself
That girl was a little different
Even as I knew she was bad I fell for her

Hate that I met her met her
I had to go too far

You’ll never be mine
Even knowing it won’t work
Just be with me
Even knowing you’re just play

I like the you that’s with me and playing with me

Oh this day
Like the time we first met
The situation is similar
Chock-full of confidence
Approaching you was my best mistake
I know I’m I just one of many fish in your big fishery
You being a bad girl is making me fall for you more
I soon as I see you I just koong koong koong
And it gets caught again, my breath breath breath
Only later am I trying to reveal the truth in side you
On the outside bad girl, deep inside an even more bad girl
Huh now let me know the real ya
Tell me everything about you
