[Chorus]
Don’t think about it too much too much too much
There’s no need for us to rush it through
Don’t think about it too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse 1]
Everyday like a machine I wake up, automatically put on make-up
That kind of life has grown familiar to me
Since when have I been so satisfied with myself?
Did I, after achieving my dream, indulge in it?
To live “comfortably”, “appropriately”, i swallowed the flames that had welled up to my throat
That’s right i’m quite disgusted with myself as well, the sharp knife has dulled
Forming the wrinkles of my twenty year old self, i was afraid of such changes
If somebody could look inside my head, they’d probably mock me
Smirking at the me who’s lost his path, I can I can hear my old friends laughin
Hey, but I just wanted to show what I got
All I ever wanted to do was rap, you said I’m a puppet, fuck I’m not
There’s too many of these countless, infinite thoughts in my head
Now I’ll put myself aside and wait for the endless waves of negativity
Yeah I’m a monster, once you become a monster you can no longer be a person
I can no longer be a human like the likes of you all
Even if that’s the very reason why people curse me
Whether I’m an artist, or an idol I don’t give a fuck this is my life
Whether it’s porridge or gruel, this is the meal I’ve prepared for myself

[Chorus]
Don’t think about it too much too much too much
There’s no need for us to rush it through
Don’t think about it too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse 2]
The me who could only see deserts and seas is now looking up at the universe
The small child who thought the tiny studio was the whole world is only just peering outside
I thought it was a real, got no time to chill, no time nobody to get healed
Too many stars, too many dreams, the reality is in front of these things i’m just a speck of dust
Once i realized that the only thing i could do was more severely lock myself in
Tamper back my fury and press it down, more strongly hide myself away
Yeah I’m a fucking monster young idol fans hate me cuz Imma fucking monster
Hiphop fans hate me too cuz I’m a fucking idol rapper who can’t come to their concert
Yeah right? you’re happy now right? so how you doin bitches
I’m earning a lot of fucking money fine thank you and you bitches
Every interview I said to them, go find your happiness
But lately I get confused sometimes, whether i’ve found my own happiness
The fact that I’m making the music I want to make, saying the things I want to say
This is the moment i’ve been waiting for, now facing the dream i so desperately wanted
I definitely achieved my dream, but after the dream I find myself hesitating
With too many thoughts; i just showed the me that’s hungry for something

[Chorus]
Don’t think about it too much too much too much too much
There’s no need for us to rush it through
Don’t think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don’t think about it too much too much too much too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through
Don’t think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Outro]
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Whatever it is

Hangul

[Chorus]
Don't think about it too much too much too much too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse 1]
매일 기계적으로 wake up, 기계적으로 메이크업
받는 삶에 익숙해져 가, 자의식과의 breakup
언제부터 내가 내게 만족했지?
꿈을 이뤄놓고 방종했지?
편하기 위해서, 적당히 지내며 목까지 차오른 불을 삼켜댔지
그래 나도 내가 참 역겨워 뾰족한 칼날이 무뎌져서
생겨버린 스무살의 주름살, 변한단 게 두려웠어
누군가 내 머릿속을 들여다본다면 분명 날 비웃겠지
이제 와서 길을 잃은 날, i can i can hear my old friends laughin
Hey, but i just wanted to show what i got
그냥 랩을 하고 싶었을 뿐야 u said I'm an puppet, fuck I'm not
너무 많아 내 머릿속에 이 수많고도 수많은 상념들
나 잠시 거두고 기다리겠어 이 쉴새없는 파도의 망년을
Yeah im a monster, 한 번 괴물이 된 이상 더 사람일 순 없어
다시 너희와 같은 인간일 순 없어 그게 사람들이 나를 씹는 이유여도
내가 아티스트건, 아이돌이건 don't give a fuck this is my life
이게 죽이 되건 죽밥이 되건 내가 차린 내 밥상이야

[Chorus]
Don't think about it too much too much too much too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse 2]
바다와 사막밖에 못 보던 내가 이제 우주를 봐
작은 스튜디오가 세상의 전부인줄 알았던 꼬마, 이제 겨우 밖을 둘러봐
I thought it was a real, got no time to chill, no time nobody to get healed
너무 많은 stars, 너무 많은 dreams, 그 앞에 난 먼지일 뿐이라는 현실
을 깨닫고서 내가 할 수 있었던 건 더 처절하게 나를 잠궜던 것
내 분노를 참고 때리고 억눌러서 더 단단하게 나를 가뒀던 것
Yeah im a fuckin monster 아이돌 어린 팬들은 날 싫어해 cuz imma fuckin monster
힙합 팬들도 싫어해 cuz im a fuckin idol rapper who can't come to their concert
Yeh right? 이제 속시원해 right? so how you doin bitches
난 존나 돈 벌어 fine thank you and you bitches
인터뷰할 때마다 그랬지, 니 행복을 찾아내
근데 나도 요즘은 가끔씩 헷갈려 내가 나의 행복을 찾았는지
내가 하고싶은 음악, 하고 싶은 그 많은 말들을 모두 할 수 있다는 것
바래왔던 순간, 간절했던 꿈과 마주할 수 있다는 것
난 분명 꿈을 이뤘는데, 그 꿈 뒤에 서 망설이네
생각이 너무 많아서 그냥 무언가 고팠던 나를 담았어

[Chorus]
Don't think about it too much too much too much too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

Don't think about it too much too much too much too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Outro]
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Whatever it is
