Ahh, shit but I see seniors five and six years above
(Hello!) Now I realize, I’m still far away
Teachers didn’t give pressure last year
Saying that I’m just a rookie and that it’s okay
They sat me down and taught me how cold the world is
With a few subjects
Bias, negative comments, double standards, smack talk and disinterest
Teacher, do we have tests for this too?
If I get first place, will I be a successful artist?
That’s good too but I wanna do music
I’ll just do what I want for now so leave me alone

A year passed like a miracle bye
But what to do? I’m getting worried
I might be a bit more comfortable but there’s still so much to learn
Every time I get a break, the teacher keeps nagging
“You need to take the test!”
What do you mean test

Just nod along, nod

Fortunately, I put up a good defense
I’m still a child, I kept running but am only in my second year
Like Gulliver traveling between strangeness and reality
I don’t care about others, I’ll just go with the flow
Bring all the losers with bias to me
Looking back makes my blood dry up
Shut up, I’m in my second year, the starting point of a new era
Hide carefully or else you’ll see past my tricks
Whether you’re a senior or junior or teacher, get the out
