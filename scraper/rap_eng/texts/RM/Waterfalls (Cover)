[RM]
Yeah, you know
It’s the double J
(One) You just stole my mind
(Two) My heart and now I’m dying
(Three) I see you the other day and you look just fine
(Four) Now still back on my mind

헤어짐을 이야기한지 벌써 몇달이
지났어 길에서 어찌 마주쳤던 넌 많이
예뻐졌고 전보다 행복해보였어
모른척한건 추웠는지 눈물이 고여서
짧은 머릴 기르고 자르기를 몇번
니가 이제 내게 없는 줄 알았던 건
떠날 때조차 급했던 내 오만이었나봐
잊으려 애썼는데 버릇처럼 엇나가
그 날 이후로 다 깎아버린 손톱 대신
추억을 깨물어 어딜 걸어도
눈길 닿는 곳마다 아지랑이처럼 피어
답을 알면서 또 내게 되물어
니가 웃을 때 나도 같이 웃을 수 있을까
아직 혼자가 아닌 둘이 더 익숙한
내 마음은 그치지 않는 눈보라에 떨어
널 떠올리면 가슴이 내려앉아 오늘처럼

[Jungkook]
어디 있을까 어디에 가면
널 우연히 만날수 있을까
어디를 가도 다 너 같아서
가슴이 내려앉아 오늘처럼

Waterfalls waterfalls (like waterfalls)
Waterfalls waterfalls (waterfalls)

Love, is just like the waterfalls..
It just drops down by its side forever and ever
Waterfalls waterfalls
Waterfalls waterfalls

(Two) My heart and now I’m dying
(Three) I see you the other day and you look just fine
(Four) Now still back on my mind

It’s already been a few months since we’ve broke up
Coming across you in the street
You seemed to look much prettier and happier than before
I pretend I didn’t see you. Maybe it was the cold weather; I had tears in my eyes
You grew out your short hair and cut it a few times
That’s when it hit me, you’re not mine anymore
I didn’t realize it when you left me because of my rash pride and arrogance
I try to forget it but like a habit it goes astray
After that day, instead of biting my short fingernails I bite onto the memories
Anywhere I go, everything I see is a haze
Even though I know the answer I continue to ask myself
While you laugh, will I be able to laugh with you?
I’m more familiar with the two of us instead of being alone
My heart shivers at the never ending blizzards
When I think of you my heart drops just like it did today

[Jungkook]
Where could you be?
Where do I have to go to meet you by chance?
Wherever I go they all seem like you
My heart drops just like it did today
