[Verse 1 - JK]
I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

[Pre-Chorus - JK]
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children’s names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake

[Chorus - JK]
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Verse 2 - RM]
Oh, our lives don’t collide, I’m aware of this
We've got differences and impulses and your obsession with it
The little things you like stick, now like aerosol
Don’t give a fuck, not giving up, I still want it all

[Chorus - RM]
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Pre-Chorus - RM]
And I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children’s names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake

[Chorus - Variation - RM + JK]
Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Bridge - JK]
Only fools fall for you only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

[Outro - JK/RM]
(JK) Only fools
Only fools fall
(RM) Only fools
Only fools fall
