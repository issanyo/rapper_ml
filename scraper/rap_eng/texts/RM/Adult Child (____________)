English Translation

[Rap Monster]
Ah.. I’m 20 now
Now that I’m actually 20.. It’s nothing special
So what am I supposed to do now?

[Chorus: Jin]
I’m 20 (now) and it’s a good day
I’ve become a free body
But what is this, there’s nothing to it I’ve only become an adult
I’ve only become an adult, I’ve only become an adult
I’ve only become an average adult, The average adult is what I’ve become
An adult

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
Some have gone to whichever college, some have gone off to military service
Some are repeating a grade and some are looking for work
The tender touch of our families, that sweet romance has come at its end
Haste and clumsiness are all what’s left
The weight of being 20, I thought would be like a feather
Now it’s a boulder that pins me down, the regret at age 20
Oh no! All the Peter Pans who’ve freshly jumped out of fairytale books
It must’ve never existed from the start, this Neverland they dream about
A little sense of liberation, a little sense of regret (for an unfulfilled wish or goal)
A little sense of hostility towards this world that’s strange to me
Because I’m now an adult I want to keep a straight face and play it cool
Youth and naivete, they’re both in vain, really
Eyah..Would you look at my lyrics, I’ve matured
A friend who’s been hired is lifting files (T/N: ‘seoryucheol’) instead of being in season (T/N: 'cheol’, literal translation of colloquial phrase for 'growing up’)
I was once a young adult but now I’m an adult child
Mom’s not around to take care of me, I’m skipping meals

[Chorus: Jin]
I’m 20 (now) and it’s a good day
I’ve become a free body
But what is this, there’s nothing to it I’ve only become an adult
I’ve only become an adult, I’ve only become an adult
I’ve only become an average adult, The average adult is what I’ve become
An adult

[Verse 2: Suga]
What every men in their 20s experience is a deep sense of remorse
Fearing military draft notes, the things that once felt so far away
Become reality. They said “[North and South Korea] would be unified by the time you’ve grown up”
That’s what mom said and I had completely believed her
But the reality is that [I’m] an able-bodied first-rate soldier material
This friend who’s perfectly healthy is a fourth-rate so why am I first-rate
How could I be so uselessly healthy
Civil duties? it’s a juvenile death sentence
I envy and envy the nation’s lowest 10%
It blows away this flowery adolescence, I’m evading military service
The roaring 20s, time when everything is luscious
They try to set fire to flower-blossomed youth
The moment I graduated after the hellish exams
I attend another school, its name is Society
Applause for courage to malesin their 20s who were forced to break from Society
And a handshake of gratitude to the nation’s 60,000 officers and men of the armed forces

[Outro]
Turned 20 and started attending a school, its name is Life
But there were no teachers there
Some will repeat a grade and some will be drafted
But do not forget this time of blissful ignorance
Adulthood, it’s nothing, really
Adulthood, it’s nothing, really
It’s nothing like how it seems, really
Really, it’s nothing like how it seems
