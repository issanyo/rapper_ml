[Verse 1]
I didn’t have any dreams
Just like my lyrics, every day in that way
The functions and equations that couldn’t give me an answer
In the end those things became uncountable injuries
It makes it impossible to see the stars hidden behind that light
Day by day, I killed myself slowly like that
Meaninglessly obsessing all day on being graded like cuts of beef
I just wanted to succeed
The words I tediously heard from others were only that
I thought I could catch the mirage known as happiness
But the me in front of my desk wasn’t happy even for a moment
Without my mom knowing, I put a sheet of white paper between the pages of my workbook
My identity that I wrote down matched to the drum and bass
A different, relaxed feeling compared to when I got my report card
Even when I was #1 my heart couldn’t relax
Is there a need to want the things that others want
Rather than living an entire life while sighing breaths full of *han*
I chose to live a life of stripping away my *han* and breathing easily
Everyone pointed at me, surrounding the weakened me
My dreams are what gives my voice to everything
No matter what appearance I have, with my mic and lyrics
I don’t know how you’ll be while listening to this, but
Even if you curse me, it’s good, because in the end you’ll find me again
Yeah, even as 7 years passed, with a mic worth 50,000 won
Still making my mixtape by myself in one corner of my room

Some say I’m fake, okay, I admit it, my dark past
I can justify it, but I won’t, so that kind of problem won’t happen again
Yeah I be real
In this moment the things that I want the most acutely
The pedal that I stepped on for 7 years has finally been oiled
You can’t kill, come take it if you do wanna piece of me
Say it only with music, I don’t need any other field
If you really think you ready to fly with my power
This is what R is about fella the time is now

[Hook]
Unbeknownst to others, raise my voice’s volume up
So you can know, so I can reach you
Once again, raise my voice’s volume up
So you can know, so I can reach you

Unbeknownst to others, raise my voice’s volume up
So you can know, so I can reach you
Once again, raise my voice’s volume up
So you can know, so I can reach you
