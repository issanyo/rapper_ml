[Chorus: J-Hope]
Because of who? Because of J-Hope
Because of who? Because of Rap Mon
Again, because of who? Because of Suga
All of the style and flow is because of Bang Tan

[Verse 1: J-hope]
The kids who will lead the 21st
Century Hallyu has started to play
We’re seven wolves
Gathering the lambs with a trap
We pull through all the broken rap from now on
We keep driving forward, giants on the beats
Bang Tan cypher right here, psycho right here
Whoever’s in the ring, we’ll win, rap fighter right here
I’ll say hi, you’ll say bye, a burnt tire, we’re different
Fire, hot choir, captivating K-Pop like PSY
My rap is huge, I’ll say right in your ear, bug that
Our riots got successively stronger
Don’t need long explanations, just explain with a rap
BTS, follow the leader, let’s go now
What

[Verse 2: Rap Monster]
I’m a rap wiper, a complete psycho, if I’m a dicer
Then I have all the dice
Cypher, if you’re nice, I’m nicer
If you’re Pride, then I’m a Chrysler
That means I’mma priceless
Who are you to judge my rap? Rapper?
This is One Piece, I’m a Whitebeard
You just have long beards like catfish, bucket
Hehe haha, honk honk, 300 per hour
I’m going through the process of working hard
I won’t discriminate but catch them all
Tombstone, knock knock knock out
Fire in the hole beat BING BING POW POW
You’ll cry and look for your dad
My voice constricts the voices of the plain rappers
At all times, like the PC cafe closing
This is a kingdom, I’m a king, you’re dumb
I’m chew you and swallow, you’re bubblegum
On top of the running man is the flying man
On top of the flying man
Is the one who rides on him
That’s me, beat, a badder guy than Rain
Like rags, I just hang it up, after I play with it
I rip up your eardrums, boom boom boom
This is the curse of my dawn, a nightmare, a riot
Serial murder, theft, doom doom doom
You’re like a Katalk with
No friends, no reason to look
Did you already wet your pants?
Sorry, there’s no bathroom
I’m commanding you, let go of the mic and get up
Just do the “chun” because you have no “shil”1
I’ll push you out because I really don’t like you
I’m good at sewing, putting it into practice
I’m growling right now, you’re in a bit of danger
Just do the “yeon,” like I said, you have no “shil”2
Rise and rise to the sky
But get ripped, Fuck it, I’ve forgotten you
My voice, my hegemony, I made it from one to ten
I put the whole world on my tongue
I play with big boys, I ain’t spittin low sh
On the CD or the TV, you can see me
Envy me, it’s a pity, gee gee
Bitch I’mma monster I rap with a prospect
Yeah I rap with a mindset I’m a suspect
Sucka where yo rhymes at where you lines at?
I’m da king, I’m the god
So where ma emperors at?
I parachute on my Neverland
I’mma peter pan, so this will never end
You know when I ride on my G5
You sit first class and satisfy and I keep giggling
Keep gigglin, keep jigglin
Bring yo fucking mic beat wanna have a go?
Hyungs who are sick with pride and
Strange beliefs get lost after 8 measures
You old caterpillars
I’ll give you this beat, give it a try
Hey, start talking when you can start rapping
There should be a law restricting you from rapping

[Chorus: J-Hope]
Because of who? Because of J-Hope
Because of who? Because of Rap Mon
Again, because of who? Because of Suga
Us three gather together and
Shout out a new generation
Because of J-Hope
Because of who? Because of Rap Mon
Again, because of who? Because of Suga
The next batter will rap on top of this beat

[Verse 3: Suga]
My domain is dopeman.com, scolded many with a mic
Speech and action are like shackles
My crime is assault with my tongue
You’re so bad ever since you were born
If you’re gonna whine about this beat, just leave
Look at the arrogance of the hip-hop con artists
When you were playing underground
BTS was playing at ground level
Compared to you who sleeps all night
I’m a workaholic, shoppaholic
Overspending on my pens that are more in number than
Your fans, if I go all in and shoot, it’s a goal in
Goal in, I’m ballin, when I hear your rap
I’m about to throw up
My voice even bewitches your girlfriend
The studio is my playground
My partner is a pen and paper
You think being escorted makes you powerful
I hope you put down your mic
If I’m the sun, you’re the moon
Because when I rise, you go down
All you hip-hip designer brand bastards
Come down from the foamy bubbles
Hey you brats, your crappy rap is a burden to others
Take a break and wait, just go to Hawaii, go home
See how far I go, all the rotten roots will be replaced
Everyone, let’s play a game
Without efforts, you’ll just be grieving
You think you can do music?
Just go look for a part-time job
Although your short and thin career
Will get you nowhere I hope you survive
Keep rotting away, that’s your label
Your life is like a mudfish, your rap is recycled
You save up and divide up the flow
Write it up and use it again
Hey beat, know that you’re embarrassing
Just with 24 measures, you lay down sick
Compared to your size, your rap is so thin
Like your parents, my heart hurts every time I see you
I’ll put a period at the artery of your music career
