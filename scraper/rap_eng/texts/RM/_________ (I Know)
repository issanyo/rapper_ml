[Chorus: RM, Jungkook]
I know you love me girl
So that I love you
Know you love me boy
So that I love you
Thank you so much
For being
At my side
For these three years

Know you love me girl
So that I love you
Know you love me boy
So that I love you
I’ll be
By your side
Always
Don’t worry ’bout a thing
My love

[Verse 1: RM]
I know
The red carpet that spreads out ahead of me
It’s red because of
The tears of blood of the people who love me
I know
Your gaze that remained on me that day
Is something shared between you and me
That can never be replaced

[Pre-Chorus: RM, Jungkook]
(say to me)
If you love me
(tell me)
If you’re same with me
To the people I’m thankful for
The only thing that I can do is
(sing for you)
Say I love you
(tell you)
That I love you too
I’ll sing with all my heart
If you say you can hear my voice

[Chorus: RM, Jungkook]
Know you love me girl
So that I love you
Know you love me boy
So that I love you
Thank you so much
For being
At my side
For these three years

Know you love me girl
So that I love you
Know you love me boy
So that I love you
I’ll be
By your side
Always
Don’t worry ’bout a thing
My love
