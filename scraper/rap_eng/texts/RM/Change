[Verse 1: RM]
Oh, tell me that dark could never win the light
Oh, tell me that wrong could never win the right
Baby, tell me that we gon' someday stop the fight
And tell me that every, everything gon' be alright
Oh tell me who’s stupid, baby, is it me or them?
Just tell me who’s insane, baby, is it me or them?
In this crazy world after patience, could we get the pearl?
But this world, which teaches me, preaches me how to curl
Oh, fuck the school
All we got is mad teachers and some visible classes
Divided spaces, and forever-lastin' stresses
Everybody’s mad
Kill people with fingers on Twitter
More than a gun, more than a knife
The tip of your tongue just glitter
Would the pain always win you gain? (Nah)
How could you bet? It's damn checkin' game (Yeah)
We're losin' again, homie, we losin' too many things
What should we tell our sons?
You know that they will be the men
Like you and me

[Pre-Chorus: RM]
If hope is a taste, what's yours?
What you eat all day? (What you eat all day?)
And if your love is a game
Are we losin', losin'? Oh

[Chorus: Together]
World is gonna change
(ooh ooh ooh)
World is gonna change
(ooh ooh ooh)
World is gonna change
(ooh ooh ooh)
World is gonna change
(ooh ooh ooh)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, yeah, tell me what is really real?
I'm tryna buy a new Ferrari for my newest deal
Baby girl say, "The world really hate us, huh?"
Pray a lot and maybe God give you Saint Laurent
Wish that I could change the world but they hold back
When it's time to go, the people just be mad again
And what if I could change the world with a pen and pad?
When it's time to vote, the people turn to mannequins
Challenge that
Namjoon, I'm the man too
I'm out in Chevy Chase the teachers used to lampoon
I sing songs, haikus
Over rap tunes, high IQ
Lookin' for a Song
Hye Kyo, hey cuuutie
Yeah
I'm tryin' to keep it a hunnit
Got no faith in the government
That's why we need each other, hey
Laughin' to keep from cryin'
Folarin's a rap monster
BTS is the ARMY
Now it's on me
I'ma keep the piece until I see some more peace
I'ma keep it G, forever keep it low-key
Take a trip to South Korea with some DC OGs
Chiefin' OG, I'm chiefin' OG
Hated by alt-rights and racist police
Say, woop woop, man, 12 comin'
They make them kids really freeze, when they say, "Freeze!" Freeze!

[Chorus: Together]
World is gonna change
(ooh ooh ooh)
World is gonna change
(ooh ooh ooh)
World is gonna change
(ooh ooh ooh)
World is gonna change
(ooh ooh ooh)

[Post-Chorus: Together]
World is gonna change
The world is gonna change
The world is gonna change
World is gonna change
The world is gonna change
The world is gonna change
World is gonna change
The world is gonna change
The world is gonna change
World is gonna change
The world is gonna change
The world is gonna change
World is gonna change

[Verse 3: Wale & RM]
Moonz, prayin' for better days for you and I
I see progress via my daughter's eyes
I think I think too much now and drink too much now
I numb it 'cause I don't wanna cry
Prayin' for better place for you and I I see some grass growin' in winter's eyes
I think I think too much now and drink too much now
To numb it 'cause I don't wanna die
I believe that real friends love you to no limit (yeah)
I believe that real change lies in the mirror (yeah)
Since I was a lil' one wasn't 'posed to get much status
Now they got they hands up for me like a stick up
Say, "Hands up, hands up" like a stick up
Hands up, hands up like a stick up
Since I was a lil' one, wasn't 'posed to get much status
Got they hands up for me like a stick up, check it

[Outro: Wale & RM]
Take it day by day, night by night
It's on you and me if I'm gon' shine
Not stoppin' day by day, night by night
It's on you and I
Moonz and the ARMY right
(My hands up)
