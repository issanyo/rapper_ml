Sup, so seductive.
So sexy. Yeah.

I think you’d look good in black stockings.
Even without them baby you’re my star king.
Girl, don’t flirt around other people.
You’re mine. You know you my own world, bitch
I’ll call you mine another bitch
Spill magic on boys, just another witch
Don’t unbutton your shirt, because I can see right through you.

Your panty line is finer than your smokey eyeline.
Why is it on the bottom, that free line.
Wild line, pipe line, that cleavage line.
Fuck, you know me too well what I like.
Oh shit, you don’t have to make it so obvious.
If you keep doing that, you make it difficult for the both of us.
Come to my place where I only think about you,
because today I think I have to punish you. Haha.

[Chorus - Jin]
It’s gon’ get you in trouble.
(oooh, oooh)
It’s gon’ get you in trouble.
