[English Translation}

Yo
There is no longer the thrill of faking an ID to get into a bar
Have now come to be an adult
There is no deal
Really, there are so many paths out there
But there is no path for me
I’m just stopped right here
There is no fuel
All the hyungs that used to do music with me are all up there
I’m the only one without a name
Like spam KaTalk
There is no hope for me, and no work
Because I know that of myself
There is even less time for rest for me
Since I know this of myself
There is no more worries for me
Now I’m coming to know the things I didn’t want to know
Friends tell me to go to college
Not understanding my heart
A little bit of feeling of freedom
And a bit of feeling of regret
And a bit of hostility about the unfamiliar world are felt
Graduation has passed and I already miss the school uniform
The timely snowfall is piling softly
I’m like an deserted island, among my friends
Entrance exams have finished, but the world is full of problems

Yeah…
