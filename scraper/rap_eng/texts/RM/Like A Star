[Chorus: 정국]
Just like a star across my sky
Just like a bird flying at dawn
I have a dream of the freedom
Feel like I'll never be the same
Just like dream of last night
Just like pictures in my head
Oh I can't realize that
Still I wonder why it is

[Verse 1: RM]
Just like a star, 내 회색같은 삶
그래 까맣지도 하얗지도 못했었지 난
그저 시간이 흐르면 흐르는대로
날 내맡겼어 늘 이런 내게도 때론
기회가 왔지만 용기마저 회색으로 칠했던 어린 난
일어서지 못하고 그대로 주저앉아 버린 다음
또 전전긍긍해, 양심의 병에 몇번 끙끙대
아침 연속극처럼 이어지는 뻔한 수순에
예민하고 벽을 쌓는 성격
주위를 겉돌 뿐, 진짜 친구는 없어
어중간한 성적 그리고 더 어중간한 일탈
하나둘 세는 양들이 너무 많아진 밤
꿈은 별처럼 많지만 별처럼 멀고
내 기분은 범죄자 아들을 둔 형사
하늘로 가는 동아줄을 알지만 닿지 못해
범인을 알지만 영원히 잡지 못해

[Chorus: 정국]
Just like a star across the sky
Just like a bird flying at dawn
I have a dream of the freedom
Feel like I'll never be the same
Just like dream of last night
Just like pictures in my head
Oh I can't realize that
Still I wonder why it is

[Outro]
넌 밤에 더 빛나
넌 누구보다 멀리 봐
니 인생은 회색빛깔

English Translation

[Jung Kook]
Just like a star across my sky
Just like a bird flying at dawn
I have a dream of the freedom
Feel like I’ll never be the same
Just like a dream of last night
Just like pictures in my head
Oh I can’t realize that
Still I wonder why it is

[RM]
Just like a star, my grey life
Yeah I can't be black or white
The time was passing by
Even though opportunities came, i painted my courage in gray when i was young
I couldn't stand up, like that I was giving up and throwing them away
Again trembling from fear, groaning about my disease of conscience
Like those  morning dramas its continues like a clear sequance
A sensitive personality that builds a wall
Just feeling out of place, I have no real friends
Uncertain grades and a more uncertain departure
One, two, three, too many nights counting sheep
I have as many dreams as stars in the sky, and like stars they're far away
My mood is like a detective with a criminal son
I know there's a rope to the sky but I can't reach it
I know the culprit but I can never catch him

[Jungkook, RM]
Just like a star across my sky
Just like a bird flying at dawn
I have a dream of the freedom
Feel like I’ll never be the same
Just like a dream of last night
Just like pictures in my head
Oh I can’t realize that
Still I wonder why it is

[Jungkook]
You’re shine more in the night
You look farther than other people can
Your life it’s a white
Ooh yeah ye-yeah yea-ea-eah
