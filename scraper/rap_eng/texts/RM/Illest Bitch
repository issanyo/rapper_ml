[Intro:]
Yo turn the music up
This song is just a love song
Dedicated to the illest bitch

[Hook:]
Illest bitch alive illest bitch alive
You’re too beautiful, you shake me up
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch around
Wait, you know I'm gon' make you mine
Look, the illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Yeah, one time for the illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive

[Verse 1:]
A white shirt, jean shorts and red converse high tops, that’s it
Do you know? (u so glam)
Honestly, I like that shit
You are so radiant, you glow
That t-shirt you’re wearing is pretty
You’re my truth and my reason
And for others an opportunity that you pay no attention to
Just like there are always bugs around a beautiful flower
I’m different
Can hear you and also see your scent
U make me crazy
Maybe yeah you could be my baby
Oh, why are you so pretty
Every day I'm happy and I keep waiting for tomorrow my lady

Make you mine, so for real, which star are you from?
Make you smile, yo so trill
What did you eat to make you grow so beautifully?
Not even words can sustain you
You’re a flower, I'm a bee bitch I call you so

[Hook:]
The illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
(you’re my illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive)
One time for the illest bitch alive realest bitch alive
(you’re my illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive yeah)

[Verse 2:]
Illest bitch alive, realest bitch around
You’re too beautiful, you shake me up
Girl now plz be my girl, you’re already my world
In my world, I'm already you and you’re already me
Haha, oh yeah, what are you waiting for?
Is it a confession? I’m confessing right now
Your eyes, small hands and that amazing body
I dare not to look
When the weather gets nicer, wear clothes that show off your back
So i can check your wings

When you pass by the guys they say, “uh yeah!”
When you pass by the girls they say, “oh, her?”
You don’t need to act modest
So throw away that attitude
You know that lowering yourself is levelling yourself to the world and it’s not like you

Girls talk about Gucci, Louis (Vuitton), Fendi, Prada
Let me tell you once again, it doesn’t suit you
Those things hide your beauty, wear some jeans
Betcha gon' make all the boys lose their mind but before then I'll catcha my

[Hook:]
Illest bitch alive illest bitch alive
(you’re my illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive)
One time for the illest bitch alive realest bitch alive
(you’re my illest bitch alive, realest bitch alive yeah)
