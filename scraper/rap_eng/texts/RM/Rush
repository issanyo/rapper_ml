RM의 Rush 가사

(Krizz Kaliko)
I should be the biggest star in the world
I should be hearing Oppa from every girl
Got to put a rush on it (서둘러)
God, help me put a rush on it (서둘러 baby)
And you could be the biggest star in the world
Don't matter, one day you're going to leave the world
Trying to put a rush on it (서둘러)
God, don't let me put a rush on it (서둘러 baby)
I want to be the one they listen to people then broke
They ears
I provoked the fears of them
Who she think about when she kissing you
When the smoke clears I provoke the tears of them
They cry they cry
When they see the dude with the thing on his eyes
Then I can open em wide, my mind
I can put the feelings of women aside
When they just feeling the vibe he got
Money for condo and a fiat. And begat the son of genius
An a re-up
So we up the creek wit out a paddle or a pre-nump
And he bouta take Ya real far like a Prius
And make it to the top of this here and get popular
Cause When people think Ya poppin and popular they
Watchin Ya
And if a cloudy day and baracades is stoppin ya
Put in da stunner shades block 'em from ya ocular
And I feels like I'm the biggest one
I'll rock it till the wheels falls off and the feelings gone
And ima push it till my digits done
Races ain't givin to the swiftest but the realist one

RM!
The only voice still ruling my world
Spreadin my voice, to the whole world
Keepin shinin like a pearl
Taking money hearing oppa from your bitches and all the
Girls
Making all the listeners flip-flop, tick-tock & switch-swap
They lanes and finna mufuckin curl
Young monster just tryna get by
Young kali we tryna get high
Gettin' B.I.G, get ready to die, mufucka u slide
Look at me gettin fly
Makin career like my mother nation man
What's KOREA in this modern Asia, man?
I am used to my moderation
But i'd lose it if you give me mo underration and..
기억나? 친구야 내 어린 날
기억해봐 마냥 랩하고 다니던 어린 날
I just do it I just do it keep rushin' with Krizz Kali
똑똑히 지켜봐라 내가 가나 어디까지

Hating? ain't about it
Complaining? ain't about it
We juss keep rushin' on it
Ke-keep rushin' on it
What? Blaming? ain't about it
Exclaiming? ain't about it
We just keep rushin' on it
Ke-keep rushin' on it
