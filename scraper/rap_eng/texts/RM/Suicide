[Verse 1]
I’ve walked this long way from home to find my real utopia
But, now I got no place to go and now I feel agoraphobia
Can’t describe how lonely I am, I know this isn’t a game
But I better be fan, I better be fame
I do this shit again and again

[Verse 2]
Boy, what the hell are you afraid of?
You are your life’s creator, something you definitely ain’t gonna get paid off
Just don’t be a bitch, be a real player
There’s nothing, I’m sick of this
Need somebody to stand by my side, for a moment no forever
Never would’ve looked for a safe to hide

[Verse 3]
I'll wait for you, I'll stay for you
If'n I think I'm made for you
Just for you, what’s made for you. Don’t know your name yet, but just for you
They always say, one day you'll be way better but I don’t believe their chatter
Honestly I’m falling up the ladder, maybe this song will be my last letter

[Refrain]
All the history and times all we have
Just tell I’m sorry and now give me your rest (I’ll take it to you)
If my passion is what you need (I’ll give it for ya)
If conclusion is what you mean, now set me free so that I’ll forget

[Refrain]
All the history and times all we have
Just tell I’m sorry and now give me your rest (I’ll take it to you)
If my passion is what you need (I’ll give it for ya)
If conclusion is what you mean, now set me free so that I’ll forget
