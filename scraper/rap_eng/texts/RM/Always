English Translation

[Verse 1]
One morning, I opened my eyes
And wished I was dead
I want someone to kill me
In this loud silence
I live to understand the world
But the world has never understood me, why
No, that half is missing
It’s trying to hurt me
I miss me miss me baby
I miss me miss me baby
I wish me I wish me baby
Wish I could choose me

Why is it that I’m being so earnest
Yet it’s not working out
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always (I lost my all ways)
Always (I lost my all ways)
Always (I lost my all ways)
Always (I lost my all ways)

If I ever meet God, I would tell him this
That life is coffee that I never ordered
I would grab him by the collar and tell him
Death is an americano you can’t refill
Are you sure that you’re alive
Then, let’s prove it somehow
When I exhale, I see my breath
On the window, there’s condensation
You are dead
You are dad, but you are dead
Dead dad you don’t listen to me
Dad please listen to me

Why is it that I’m being so earnest
Yet it’s not working out
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always (I lost my all ways)
Always (I lost my all ways)
Always (I lost my all ways)
Always (I lost my all ways)

어느 날 아침 눈을 떴을 때
내가 죽었으면 했어
누군가 날 죽여줬음 좋겠어
이 시끄러운 침묵 속에서
난 세상을 이해하기 위해 사는데
세상은 날 이해한 적이 없어 왜
아니 딱 절반이 모자라
날 해하려 하잖아
I miss me miss me baby
I miss me miss me baby
I wish me I wish me baby
Wish I could choose me

왜 이렇게 간절한데
이뤄지지 않나요

신을 만난다면 얘기하겠어
삶은 주문한 적도 없는 커피라고
그 멱살을 잡고 말해주겠어
죽음은 리필이 안되는 아메리카노
당신은 살아있단 확신이 있나요
그렇다면 그걸 어떻게 증명하죠
나는 숨을 후 불면 입김이 나는데
창에 김이 서리긴 하는데
You are dead
You are dad, but you are dead
Dead dad you don’t listen to me
Dad please listen to me
