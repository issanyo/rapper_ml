랩몬스터 (RM) 의해 Seventeen 가사

Hangul

[Intro]
Uh Yeah
I'm already seventeen
Time flows too fast

[Verse 1]
Yeah
가끔 고개를 들어 밤하늘에 떠있는 별을 보면
난 생각이 들곤 해 어디로 흘러가는 건지
의문이 들어 불투명해진 Future
모든 판단의 기준이 이미 공부로 굳혀진
현실을 원망하며 Mp3를 켜
나와는 먼 이 사랑 노래들도 지겨운 걸
내일은 수행평가가 있는데 어쩔까
밤새 고민하다가 책상 위로 잠들어 ah
난 왜 이 모양이니 어디가 내 설 자리니
하다못해 꿈 같은 것도 없을까 몇 살이니
어느덧 어른을 향해 가는데
해보고 싶은 건 많은데
시간은 저 멀리 달아나 못 느낄 만큼 더 빠르게
아 아 아무도 날 이해할 순 없을 것 같아
또 그리워만 하다가 끝날 단꿈일 것 같아
내가 왜 이리 철없는 건지 아직 몰라
Tellin' about my life?
It's like 한 잔의 콜라

[Chorus]
Life is the same
(Life is the same yeah)
But it's not that lame
(But it's not that lame)
We can change the game eh eh eh
You and I can't be more tame eh eh eh

Life is the same
(Life is the same baby)
But it's not that lame
(But it's not that lame)
We can change the game eh eh eh
You and I can't be more tame eh eh eh

[Verse 2]
You think your life's the same
The money, the fame
That's not all about your life
You already know it's a game
넌 절대로 배신할 수 없어
누구도 대신할 수 없어
아무도 가져가 줄 순 없어 내 시간, 추억들
결국 너잖아 니 인생을 다 가져가는 건
나태와 Sleepin' 그리고 게으름, 널 유혹하는 것
말 못할 고민은 다 음악, 랩으로 날려버려
Don't stop finding yourself in you
절대로 멈추지 마 돌아봐 니가 널 꾸짖나
Don't ever be losin' mind
니가 알아왔던 세상이 다가 아냐 그러니 죽이지 마
미랜 아직도 가야 할 길이 많이 남아있고
니 발밑으론 수많은 밥그릇들과 세월이 쌓여있어
You know 여기서 한탄하는 니가 젤 미련한 놈이야
딱 알아들어 너 사람이잖아 니가 돌이야?
이제 후회도 필요 없다는 걸 난 알아
I know it'll forever ever and ever be my life

[Chorus]
Life is the same
(Life is the same yeah)
But it's not that lame
(But it's not that lame)
We can change the game eh eh eh
You and I can't be more tame eh eh eh

Life is the same
(Life is the same baby)
But it's not that lame
(But it's not that lame)
We can change the game eh eh eh
You and I can't be more tame eh eh eh

[Outro]
Everybody
Who feels life's the same
Your life is not the same
You have to rise and dream again
It sayin' like life is not the same
It's all of dream

English

[Intro]
Uh yeah
I’m already 17
Time flows too fast

[Verse 1]
Yeah, sometimes I lift my head up to look at the stars then I begin to think
Wondering where my life is heading? Uncertain of my future
Every standard is judged by the basis of your education
As I resent this reality, I turn on my mp3
I’m tired of these love songs that don’t have anything to do with me
Tomorrow I have my school performance evaluation, what should I do?
I worry all night and end up falling asleep on the desk
Ugh why am I like this? Where do I stand?
At least I have some kind of dream
How old are you? I’m slowly becoming an adult and I still want to do many things
But time flies too fast you can’t even notice it
I feel as though nobody will understand how I feel
I don’t want to give up like I have with other dreams
I don’t know why feel so immature
Telling about my life is like a cup of Cola

[Chorus]
Life is the same (life is the same yeah)
But it’s not that lame (but it’s not that lame)
You can change the game
You and I can’t be more tamed

Life is the same (life is the same baby)
But it’s not that lame (but it’s not that lame)
You can change the game
You and I can’t be more tamed

[Verse 2]
You think your life’s the same?
The money the fame that’s not all about your life you already know it’s a game
You can never betray it
No one can do it instead
They can’t take away my time and memories
It’s eventually you who will be living out your life
The lack of motivation that I once had will appeal to you too
Write your emotions into music or a rap and let them go
Don’t stop finding yourself in you, never stop
As you walk around you’ll notice
Don’t ever be losing mind
That the world you thought you knew is not at all what you think
So don’t lose confidence
You still have a long way to go the future is bright
Your experience will grow and flourish
You know, you’re the most foolish one here
You understand what I’m saying you’re not a rock
Now I know that there’s no need to regret
I know it will forever ever and ever be my life

[Chorus]
Life is the same (life is the same yeah)
But it’s not that lame (but it’s not that lame)
You can’t change the game
You and I can’t be more tamed

Life is the same (life is the same baby)
But it’s not that lame (but it’s not that lame)
You can change the game
You and I can’t be more tamed

[Outro]
Everybody who feels life’s the same
Your life is not the same
You have to rise and dream again
And say the line “life is not the same”
It’s all a dream
