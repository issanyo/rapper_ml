Korean Original
멈춰 그 곳에 제발 가까이 오지 마
알아 나 이러면 안 되는 걸 너무 잘 알고 있는데 나
But I fall for ya, so I call for ya
Oh my girl, for ya 나 너를 걷고 싶어
널 처음부터 아니 더 전부터
마음에 뒀는지도 몰라 아무래도 상관없잖아
Oh 너와 있을 때 혼자 있을 때
이 불편함을 떨칠 수가 없어
But oh 나를 잊게 돼 자꾸 잊게 돼
기침과 사랑은 감출 수가 없어 baby

Tick 'n tock, i juss keep on knockin'
Plz don't stop, juss put me on top
니가 가진 슬픔의 색깔까지 공유하고 싶어
진짜 진심이야
남자친구? 난 십점 만점에 백점
키크고 목소리 좋은 전국권 랩퍼
똑똑한 머리, 헉 소리나는 비율
나와 다닌단 건 어디 자랑할 만한 일
Dandy, sexy, whatever you ask me
보여줄게 baby, only you could test me
남들의 생각, fuck it
내 눈을 봐 이건 우리 둘만의 something
남자는 남자다워야 하는 것
까만 피부, yeah 내 남자다운 멋
보물은 그 가치를 아는 이가 가져야 돼
And baby, yes 너라면 가져도 돼

And this could be something
Girl, girl I say I say
I say this could be something

This is something

English Translation

Stop there, please don’t come close
I know if I’m like this it won’t work
I know all too well
But I fall for ya, so I call for ya
Oh my girl, for ya I want to walk with you
You from the beginning—no from earlier than that
I don’t know whether you liked me
In any case it doesn’t matter
Oh when I’m with you, when I’m alone
I can’t shake this discomfort
But it’s okay that you forget me, it’s okay that you keep forgetting me
You can’t hide a cough or love, baby

Boyfriend? I’m 100 points out of 10
Tall, good voiced nationwide rapper
Smart head, proportions that make you gasp
Wherever you go it’s easy to boast about being with me
Dandy, sexy, whatever you ask me
I’ll show you baby, only you could test me
Other’s thoughts, fuck it
Look into my eyes, this is just the two of ours something
The things men have to have
Dark skin, yeah, my manly fashion
Once you know the value of these treasures, you can have them
And baby, yes, if it’s you, you can have me

And this could be something
Girl, girl I say I say
I say this could be something
