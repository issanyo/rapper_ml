English Version
[RM]
They doubted us didn’t think we’d make it this far
They judged us harshly for five years but now we got seven more and that’s enough to mop the floors with their tears

[Suga]
People who don’t understand us really hate seeing us come this far
But now we’re here and its 2018
We’ve done so many great things you wouldn’t even believe
Just two years ago it seemed like breaking into the western industry was just a dream and not a reality for people of non western nationality

[J-hope]
Now look at us seven who came from nothing but broken dreams to become something and now we’re Beyond the Scene!

[Jin] *synchronizes*
Ohh Whoa ohh whoa yeAH!
