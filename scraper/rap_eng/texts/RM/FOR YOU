ENGLISH TRANSLATION

It smells like you
The road that I walk on
I plug my earphone to my status
My true feelings lie beyond there

Baby why you far away
I can’t get used to you not being here
I feel like something is missing
I just want to be together with you always

When I realize we were only be able to meet inside this smartphone
You appeared before my eyes
Today too I feel the sadness of not able to see you
Contrary to my feelings time passes rapidly
Even if I feel insecure
I believe that my heart will not leave you
My heart will reach past beyond the wind
I am always under the same sky my baby

Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile

Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
İnside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always

We live far away from each other
Today too I feel lonely
I want to see you
The night that I am alone I unnecessarily feel the lonelier
With distance my heart opens more
It feels unbearable when I hear your rumor
I become more frustrated with more time passes
The amount that over flows always
Oh girl your smile still remains here
Even if we are apart my feelings are
Still the same, we are always together
Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile

Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
İnside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always

Even if we are far away
We are looking at the same sky
Even if something happens
If you are here I am not afraid anymore
I believe
Our love will lit for eternity
It will always stay beautiful as it is
It will always be like cherry blossom pedals

Everything is for you~
Everything is alright
Even if there is no answer
Everything is inside your smile

Truth
Even if we are apart
Our hearts are connected to each other
Forever with you

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
İnside the sun
I am embracing you always
Inside my heart forever

Flutter already
Flower petals shower
Sparkle already
Under the sun forever just the two of us
It is alright since we are connected always
