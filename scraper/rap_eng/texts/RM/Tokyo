RM tokyo 가사

[Verse 1]
Wake up in Tokyo, feel like a torso
I know it's time to go
I see Pinocchio wearing a poncho
That's me some time ago
Do I miss myself?
Do I miss your face?
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know (I don't know)

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, oh

[Verse 2]
Life is a word that sometimes you cannot say
And ash is a thing that someday we all should be
When tomorrow comes
How different it's going to be?
Why do love and hate sound just the same to me?

[Bridge]
I can't sleep
Homesick babe
I just wanna
Stay right next to you
If I could choose my dream
I just wanna
Stay right next to you

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh, oh

[Outro]
(Whistling)
