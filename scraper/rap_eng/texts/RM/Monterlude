[Verse 1]
I don't wanna kick this at all
I want you to want me, that's all
But we don't know how, yeah
We don't know how
It sounds great and fresh, shawty ain't it?
I'll take you to the mall
Buy clothes, what you wanted
Any day you can call
We are the one, we are the one
I'll pray, I'll stay, yeah
You make me this way
Girl, you make me say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Oh round and round, you make me fly
Now I ain't down and out, you makin' me cry
Yeah, girl, you got me say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, round and round, you make me fly
Now I ain't down and out, you makin' me cry
Yeah, girl, you got me say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
