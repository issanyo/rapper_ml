English:
Nanana nananana Lalala lalalala
B-b-b beating away (x2)
Can I kiss ya baby girl?
You know that? Look at your charm, it’s so great
Even if you fall down, beautiful smile
Are you a boy? Girl? I don’t care – passion is the key, a hot heart is your ID
If you’re alone, come here – put everything in your hot heart
Girl I like ya really really like ya, now just jump up and leave the rest to me
My training shirt is drenched with sweat, G.L.A.M. from the Mars
1 2 3 4 ready to start
(Girl I like ya really really like ya)
B-b-beating hearts, you and I, we are the same girls
Maybe there’s no need to win
(Come on! I’m heartbeat away)
A Kiss XXO, anyone can be a Romeo
A touch of your lips XXO, if the heart starts to race, you’re Juliet Juliet
Let’s get the Party Party started
Next to you, heartbeat away, B-b-b Heartbeat away (x2)
Nanana nananana Lalala lalalala B-b-b beating away
(Come on! I’m heartbeat away)
Nanana nananana Lalala lalalala B-b-b beating away
Because we break the rules, we dodge the rules
Got the right to break the wall – everyone move
Opposition for opposition won’t work – take off the blindfold that covers your eyes
(Be confident) We’re a minority (Fling it off) We’re ET that came to earth
You make my heart heart heartbeat! Everybody lets pa pa party
A Peace XXO, just hug everyone. Only Love
A touch of the heaven XXO, just shout out, o-e-oh o-e-oh
Let’s get the Party Party started
Next to you, heartbeat away, B-b-b Heartbeat away (x2)
G.L.A.M. My heart calls you, jump up, roll your feet
G.L.A.M. Your heart calls me, Let’s start the party for love
Party is heartbeat away
(Wo-oh-o-oh-o Wow-wo-o-oh-o)
Yeh, don’ t stop the beat now, now is the time, you shine more than anyone else
Start the final countdown, touchdown above the blue sky
Let’s burn this earth, let’s burn it all, let’s burn it all
Party is heartbeat away
(Wo-oh-o-oh-o Wow-wo-o-oh-o)
