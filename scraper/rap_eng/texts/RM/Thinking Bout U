[Intro]
Yo, it's Rap Monster
I try to love nonstop
Mr. David O
Talkin' bout real love
Woah ooh woah
Oh ooh woah
Oh ooh yeah
Leggo yo, 1 2

[Verse 1: RM]
Too complicated, too sophisticated
너란 차 선탠이 짙어 왜이리
학생다운 얼굴 학생답지 않은 몸매
Be my kitty girl, 내게로 올래
Wassup, 하나부터 열까지 널 다 말해줘
키, 몸무게, 입는 옷, 이상형까지
니가 전에 누굴 만났든 난 상관없어
Please, where you at, what is new, what's your style

[Pre-Chorus: RM, Rick Ross]
(Ask you what your interests are, who you be with)
보기만 해도 상큼했어, 넌 마치 kiwi
(Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial)
어둡고 까맣던 날 다시 웃게 만든 smile
You keep that
가까이 갈수록 널 알고 싶어 깊게
네게 나를 칠해줘 끝없이 번질게
함께 해 혼자이기엔 넌 아름다워 이제

[Chorus: David Oh]
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about tonight, baby
I'm thinkin' bout you
Thinkin' bout you
Thinkin' bout you
Thinkin' bout you
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about tonight, baby
I'm thinkin' bout
(Who they attracting with that line, "What's your name? What's your sign?")
(Soon as he buys that wine, I just creep up from behind)

[Verse 2 RM]
빨간 Converse High에 청 반바지
농담 아니야 you super fly
주말은 무료해 yeah it's free
But 누구에게 쓰느냐에 따라 다르지, I made it
Let's go to church or a club drink liqor at a pub
어른이 되면 너와 첨으로 꼭 해보고 싶은 것
넌 이미 넘어올 기미뿐이니 떼지 마 시치미
So believe me and just pick me, please promise me you'll be with me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ask what your interests are "Who you be with?")
눈길만 줘도 상큼했어, 넌 마치 kiwi
(Things to make you smile, What numbers to dial)
슬프고 힘들던 날 다시 웃게 만든 smile
You keep that
가까이 갈수록 널 알고 싶어 깊게
네게 나를 칠해줘 끝없이 번질게
함께 해 혼자이기엔 넌 아름다워 이제

[Verse 1: RM]
Too complicated, too sophisticated
Why is my suntan so much darker than yours?
A face that matches a student but a figure that doesn’t
Be my kitty girl, come up to me
Wassup, from one to ten tell me everything about you
Height, weight, the clothes you wear, even your ideal type
Before you I didn’t care who I met
Please, where you at, what is new, what’s your style

[Pre-Chorus: RM, Rick Ross]
(Ask you what your interests are, who you be with)
Just looking at you is refreshing, you’re like a kiwi
(Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial)
Your smile that made the dark and gloomy me smile
You keep that
As we get closer I want to know you more deeply
Paint me on you, I want to spread without end
Let’s do it together, you alone are beautiful now

[Chorus: David Oh]
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about tonight, baby
I'm thinkin' bout you

[Verse 2: RM]
Red Converse High, jean shorts
It’s no joke, you super fly
My weekend’s free, yeah it’s free
But it depends on who’s asking, I made it
Let’s go to church or a club, drink liquor at a pub
If I become an adult, the things I want to try with you for the first time
You already gave me a sign, don’t play coy
So believe me and just pick me
Please promise me you’ll be with me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ask what your interests are "Who you be with?")
Just glancing at you is refreshing, you’re like a kiwi
(Things to make you smile, What numbers to dial)

Paint me on you, I want to spread without end
Let’s do it together, you alone are beautiful now
