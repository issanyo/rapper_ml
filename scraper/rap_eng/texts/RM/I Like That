Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uhwoouh
Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uh
When I’m sitting alone at a BBQ restaurant
And ordering a 2 person meal and cooking the meat by myself
I’m alright – I like that, I like that
I’m alright even when I’m alone
At the kareoke, without any friends
Throwing my own recital until the time is up
I’m alright – I like that, I like that
I’m alright even when I’m alone
Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uhwoouh
Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uhwoouh
What did you say? I like that, I like that
I I I I I I I Like That
Fall in love and break up
Sometimes crying, smiling or just living life
In the end, everybody (like it), everybody (like it)
Everyone has their own charm
Say it (like it)
Fall in love and break up
Sometimes crying, smiling or just living life
In the end, everybody (like it), everybody (like it)
Everybody (like it like it like it)
Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uhwoouh
Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uh
Even when I see a cockroach
I have no choice but to catch it on my own
It may be dirty but I like that, I like that
I feel gross but it’s alright
Even when I’m drunk and crawling back home
You, who used to take care of me, aren’t by my side
So it feels crappy but I like that, I like that
I feel gross but it’s alright
Fall in love and break up
Sometimes crying, smiling or just living life
In the end, everybody (like it), everybody (like it)
Everyone has their own charm
Say it (like it)
Fall in love and break up
Sometimes crying, smiling or just living life
In the end, everybody (like it), everybody (like it)
Everybody (like it like it like it)
Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uh
Let’s go, when I sold my couple ring
When I went to the movies alone
When I fall asleep to sad music
There’s no choice but to feel crappy
But I do well on my own
Actually, I kind of like that
I will be the old me once again
I will change (and lose weight)
Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uhwoouh
Uhwoo uhwoouh uhuhwoo uhwoouh
What did you say? I like that I like that
I I I I I I I Like That
