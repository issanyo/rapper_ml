I’ll start the Bangtan Room introduction
Where should I start
Here, this is Snoop Dogg’s DoggyStyle
It’s the best of the best albums, how cool is that
Next to that is J.Dilla
Everyone picks him as the best of the hip hop producers
Here is Michael Jackson
Beat it!! You can see the awesomeness with just a glance
Here, this very machine
It gave inspiration to many people
Above that is a poster
Of the legendary group that once shook the hip hop world, Monsters
And
Check it out
A.S.R. 10
Kanye, Timbo, and Neptunes used to use it too
I don’t know why, but the price is nice too
Above that are these cool skateboard decks
Don’t be jealous because they’re discontinued
And here are a few cute figurines
There’s another figurine behind me
Ayo Wassup Jin! Wassup!
Now I’ll introduce myself
My name is Rap Monster and I rap nonstop
Rap  is my hobby, dream, specialty, and what I am suited for
A rap prodigy at 19, the sunbaes up there are scared of my debut
And are name is BTS
Those who like hip hop, gather here
Lodi dodi we likes to party
I’ll leave a seat open for you
