(Verse)
The truth is being cast aside
We’ve been dooked into a vast mirage
I’m a cross between master fon and a astronaut
Murderous appetite, war games and transic cops
Virginal sacrifice, coronage of panic ops
Father of abomination like Manson's pops
Blood ceremony homie, make sure the dagger's sharp
Pocket down briefcase, exchange cosmic shots
Diamonds and golden guns, smashing you with hands of bronze
Rap pin calm with the cameras on
Drop the creek, touch a gramatonic Babylon
I’m 1000 horse power when the mag the bomb
With more than enough fire power to splatter yall
It puts a shootout at the Grimy Awards, I spent 90 in court
I took the murder and deprive assault
Beat the case, roll the dice and I walk
Like a forty deuce Hebrew played the corner of a mic when I talk

(Hook x4)
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slap-box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph

(Verse)
From gunning to glory, another young hustler’s story
Learn from the mistakes of my uncle that done it before me
But choppa base death, horror, leave children crying
Get out like slayer throat form, slick pushin rhymes
Young shooters bring a pistol full
Caught up in that crucifixion rituals
While worshiping Lucifer habitual
The streets raised me, I’m from Brooklyn like Jordan to Jay-Z
To be where I’m from is a great thing
While yall daydream I make things happen
Get things clapping, spray things laughing
18 I stopped taking acid,
But it left a stain on my brain that remain massive
Thoughts of perceptional open 'til they lay me in a casket
Until I stop making murder rap
Because the bible was written by those who were givens - the earth is flat
And I’ll be dead before this war stops
Praying that the author of the Warlocks the will throw rocks

(Hook x4)

(Verse; H.R.)
Yes, you bring some praises to the king of kings
And the lord of law is pumping my new frap of luna
He looked to, I’m bringing my Moscone and I’m like me welcome also
I’ve got a mind out of my mind
Oh I been up so once you love
Either Moscone, boy that’s your low
Boy let us do what she like
Kikeraimis Jerusalem
Il al alum, asrahum
Jehovia alam
Slash ey lovey
Steve link some praises too, to the king of kings
I’m the prophet lovay, I got out it
Of the almighty twelve tribes of Israeli
And the only holy god of Israel and also everywhere

With the purples drink
And the supernatural beings
Supernaturalistic kings and queens, yeah
With the purples drink
And the supernatural beings
In the burning bright
At the shining light

The will to chill with Ill Bill
