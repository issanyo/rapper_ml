[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm at the opera sitting up in the balcony
Gun aimed at the valkeyrie
Backstage I dabble in black magic & alchemy
Briefcase of cash, passports with a fake name
Traveling through Russia with bombs on a freight train
Turn popes to cokeheads cause they broke bread with goat heads
Paranoid skitzophrenics with no meds
Weaving through the Vatican traffic on a moped
Carrying machine guns, cops scream code red
Command center computers scramble to find intruders
Police scan the local rooftops for sharp shooters
I'm cold as Siberia, flow is so superior
The smell of cigars stain Mercedes interior
The black snow, black hole leader like Castro
I'm sitting in a cemetery poisoning black crows
The mass knows nothing of my fiendish plots
They try deciphering the rhymes that this genius drops
I concoct concoctions to make your heartbeat stop
We're locked in a Russian gulag sleeping on old cots
Guards moving like robots patroling the cellblocks
30 below zero, who the hell said Hell's hot?
I swore to my maker I'd never spit a wack flow
Or spend eternity in Hell shoveling black snow

[Hook: Ill Bill]
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we are after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow

[Verse 2: Sicknature]
The Snowgoons are battering rams through your speaker
Hazardus craft that´ll freeze ya
Earthquaking bangers, and smackers that slap all who´s sleeping
Landscapes are shaking cause we´re lacing em hard
We are like a 4 horsemen awakening when displaying the art
This what you need like Main Source ya´ll, my brain bombs
Will give a beat a new zip code next to a Graveyard corpse
Even placed on the sun I´d stay all raw
When Sick grabs a pencil
You´ll drowning ienthleat msnthea,I spllng it, you as relevant as garbage
We stomp through your empire like the elephants of Carthage
Colder than the poles when the notions are woven
Stay in control and keep one eye open like Odin
When the market is too numb, march to the goon drum
Till it´s a wrap, leaving you wrapped in a carpet of goosebumps
There´ll be no time for a last phone call
When the dark skies open to let the black snow fall


[Hook]

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
I got a sinister plot to administer shots
Samurais that let hammers fly, ninjas with Glocks
Bust through brick walls, walk through glass
Terminator Titled, let 'em live, why would I do that?
Dumping everything I got at ya
Don't you think it's odd that I run this shit from Antarctica to Ottawa?
Stuff you in a garbage truck,cause you been trash
Wear your hat straight, but I'll put snaps where your brim at
Make you rock a special needs helmet cause you been wack
Uppercut punch, left you bent back
Halfway up your nose was the chin strap
The doctor handed me some notes and this graph
That said this boy need a skin graft
I don't talk to cops so save that report
My interrogation video's a Charlie Chaplin short
So when you hear the gat blow we comin' through the backdoor
I let the brrrat go repping for Black Snow

[Hook]
