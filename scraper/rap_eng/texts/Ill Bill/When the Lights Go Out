[Chorus]
Whatchu gonna do when the lights go out?
No trace of the money in your bank accounts
Panic and chaos in the streets of the city
Each man for themselves and police ain’t got pity
This is where we separate the weak from the strong
Who survives, who dies, who’ll keep keep on
Enemy amongst enemy fighting it out
So whatchu gonna do when the lights go out?
[Verse 1: Sabac]

This is the day of doom, lit by the moon vocally prophesized
Penalties, empty energy overly modernized
Rich are sodomized, the initial conception
It’s like prisons and communism that fits in deception
No cellphones, radio, no Internet, or TV
No planes, no cars, no lit homes, and prone to bleed
We cloned our seeds expecting we can own, decree
Now we’re back to primitive earth we roamed for free
Most ain’t built for the challenge and get killed for the balance
The water supply low, a few million gallons
For the billions of people, watch that number decrease
Everyone is on their knees begging for something to eat
Disease claims many lives, people pray to their maker
See the pain in their eyes in a state of omega
Escape the cold and the heat, we’re faced to fold and defeat
We walk the edge of the earth burning the soles of our feet
There’s no control in the streets, it’s worse than looting and riots
Worse than a shooting or virus, more like pursuing a diet
Of human flesh, grotesque but it’s survival of the fittest
Amazed how you behave in the arrival of the finish

[Chorus]
Whatchu gonna do when the lights go out?
No trace of the money in your bank accounts
Panic and chaos in the streets of the city
Each man for themselves and police ain’t got pity
This is where we separate the weak from the strong
Who survives, who dies, who’ll keep keep on
Enemy amongst enemy fighting it out
So whatchu gonna do when the lights go out?

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
In ancient times the nighttime represented the death of life
The sunrise a rebirth we’ve left for trife
Taken for granted, nations in panic, worldwide chaos
It’s starvation raping the planet, it’s Satan that planned it
The Unabomber predicted this would happen
Imagine the lights went out, credit and debit cards are dead now
Billionaires are thrown to the lions, heads of trillion dollar corporations
Are thrown out of skyscraper windows crying
No more email, text messages, or smart phones
No more free mp3’s or illegal downloads
No more governments, total anarchy
The few that knew how to use solar energy as a power source were massacred
During the gas riots of 2017, gas prices eighteen dollars a gallon
It set the streets on fire, the beast admired the least to cry
Amongst the thieves and liars that make use of the violence
Peep the science
We’re relying on the sun’s power, get your sundial
Put your gun down? Think about your daughters and your sons now
Think about these cannibals you have to hunt down
By high noon it’s raw, armageddon’s at sundown

[Chorus x 2]
