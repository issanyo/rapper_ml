[Intro:]
Dey can’t predict you the usual
You’re better of course nowadays they all specialist

[Instrumental]

[Chorus:]
Call me the specialist professional professor a this rap (science)[x2]

[Verse 1:]
Yo I’m not placed between probs of death
And undead the cross space between yo final breath
And yo long bleed you try to hold on but the call from beyond
Was around overwhelming strong and fundamentally gone
Thou your vital side seems to function you wanna kill something
Then feel bloodshed without it you undress
A cross without soul voices of the people that you love was left in your mind rock
In thank god for mercy of faith universal hate bitches
In church proclaim murder that change we demolish the kings=dom off the high
And deny realistic you wonder if our style trying to fine
Biscuits puttin up to yo enemies hadin what he would so to you if you were
In the same position that he was in drowning in the pool of blood that he was
But you're the grim-reaper’s friend put him underneath his death bed

[Chorus] [x4]

[Verse 2:]
One thing thou dream about it it’s very different
The snakes before they always had a reason to be
When reason have me freezing i can easily see the cold reality
And twist of long gain salaries thru the doctor take place
Like has been heroine thats puttin all my friends into head locks
We was scared thinking we could virtually arrest drugs
Instead a living the years almost dreamt about my doing scared things
Like having kids outta wed-lock, oppress for mixes pushing it straight
Crooked looking oh wat could I do its so long everyone
Here looking at you they treat me like animals at tha zoo
When i’m on stage when they see me at the movie theatre
Groupie scared of me and you like they truly scared of people thinking
That I changed i’m the same as I ever was biger balls, bigger guns money drugs

[Chorus]
