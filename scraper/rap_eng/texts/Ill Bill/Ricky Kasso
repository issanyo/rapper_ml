First time I did acid was in Flatbush, Brooklyn
East Flatbush to be exact if you looking for accuracy
Fuck you shackles, I'm free
Thank You LSD and mushroom fragments in tea
Watching Yellow Submarine and laughing at Blue Meanies
The true meaning
Open the door and walk through the ceiling
The matrix is gone, I view clearly
Realizing society is brainwashed is a brutal feeling
Finally see who's really the truth and who's the demon
Who's still sleeping in the womb dreaming? Who's scheming?
Who's smoking angel dust with Rick and Russell?
Who's equipped to hustle?
Who's the one that always thinks first and who's the muscle?
Who's the bible burner?
Did that guy that wrote Fight Club realize that 'Tyler Durden' rhymes with 'violent murder'?
Sometimes I gotta
Rethink my strategy
Rethink reality
Rethink sanity
