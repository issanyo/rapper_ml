They're coming here. They're waiting at the edge of the city
They're peering around buildings at night
And they're waiting, they're waiting for you
And they'll take you one by one and no one will hear you scream
No one will hear you SCREEEAAAM !!!

[Necro]
Stick an ax in your guts like Maximus bumpin Exodus
Bonded by hemoglobin dumpin clips in your tits the anarchist activist
The brotherhood of evil mutants run up on you
Shootin people fuckin feeble unit none of us are good
The toxic avengin your head the reverend of death
In the end the revelation of flesh being stretched to the ending
Your homo click is exterminated like vermin
Roamin through train stations terminated by electrical currents occurin
I rock a pair of Nikes hiking through the streets
Like a viking holding spikes I'm civilized and devilized don't sleep
You're not ill you perpetrate the blood that circulates
In your vertebrae your squirting your shirt with the perverted murder percolate
The revolting insulting cult king is resulting
As the sickest fuck on the planet earth catapulting molting
I'll be a billionaire and still be down to throw you down the stairs
And kill you rockin you with military keep it ill on you

[Ill Bill]
I don't care come God of atrocity fuck you with 5 fingers constantly
The monstrosity king of the scum bags king of colostomy
My gun bang we run things give you a neck tie
Look how your tongue hangs it's bloodbath pornography
Splatter fest the sado masochist I'll paint the walls with your blood
Physical graffiti cynical agreeing
This is murder world welcome to your death after the afterlife
I'll murder you again laugh with the burner to your head
Suicide soldiers like the heavens gate die obsessed with hate
Blood stained holy books are like a test of faith
Like the word of God telling me to kill, or the word of pagans
Telling me to sacrifice you in the name of satan
Pain lost an abomination unholy combination
Circle of tyrants we control an entire nation
That can attack you like the Dawn of the Dead
Rather be backstage catchin head from your daughter instead

[Goretex]
You on all fours candle stuck to your back like gauze
I'd rather make a lamp shade of your skin tac you to walls
When the boredom sets in pull out my axe from the stall
Howie pops up enough packs to last us til fall
The wizard of gore diminished like your skull with a sword
Emotionless leave it to a finish like midgets and dwarfs
God hates us all so we burn churches your mouth's a urinal bitch
Blaze with the deep purple I hurt you on purpose
I never got shit handed to me
The silver spoon is only used to cook the food in the pot your kid's a fantasy
We sick goons we don't give a fuck what you say
Above the law dead an apology strait from DA's
Blaze law killa go coked berretta the scheme
If I don't blow up this lab in the kitchen from methamphetamines
The wall's closin in too much to fight
Pay Per View suicide we all die tonight

[Mr. Hyde]
Yo I slay who I wanna when creating a horror
See my state of nirvana is to make you a goner
Stick a pick in your stomach because I'm sick of you frontin
But still I'm quicker to bludgeon and catchin victims with nuthin
I'll whip out the sharp shank and stick and jig up with ease
I watch your ligaments bleed with very vigorous speed
My left hook is known to put a bitch in the scene
And transform his face into mystery meat
After I clap at the wig your skull will snap like a twig
There ain't no little body counts I make my massacres big
Carefully put in my clips so that the bullets could rip
You gettin butchered to bits to me is as good as it gets
Bet you leave on a stretcher when the 16 wet ya
Wit ya cap twist it back like a major league catcher
Your head will bleed ketchup and your garments are soaked
Watch me finish the job with somethin sharp in your throat
