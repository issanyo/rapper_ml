[Verse 1:Vinnie Paz]

I’m a motherfucking chainsaw, see everything it remain raw
Why you think we brought Q-Unique and Slaine for?
The same reason that Henry the 8th was king for
The same reason Kaczynski was in the bing for
The thoughts going through Tyson’s mind in his ring walk
If it’s beef I suggest to you that you bring chalk
Everything is more merciless than a Ming thought
You in county and thought that you speaking bing talk

[Hook]

I feel how I feel cause I was born to kill
Ain’t no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I feel how I feel ’cause I was born to kill
The metal in your mouth like you was rocking braces

[Verse 2:Q-Unique]

After the game ends I’m blasting from Gravesend
You rapping for gay men, I’m a master of mayhem
Hah, the city’s a pool of devils and sin
I give you the tools that’ll sever your skin
Slice with the hands of a track assassin
Choking a victim keeping the gat from blasting
I’m hoping and wishing these streets let me stack from rapping
I’m speaking a crack holding a Magnum cannon, Q’s glamming

[Refrain]

I feel how I feel cause I was born to kill
Ain’t no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I feel how I feel ’cause I was born to kill
The metal in your mouth like you was rocking braces

[Verse 3:Ill Bill]

I’m ghetto like Strawberry in a limo copping rocks in Queensbridge
Real shit, keep your weapons concealed kid
This is for soldiers that chose to ride, those that died
Logo made of skulls and nines, murderers multiply
Souls divide those that know the road survive, scope the sky
Vultures fly, Desert Eagle chrome collide, close your eyes
It's the hellion, my rebellion retaliate
I'll have the whole New York State aiming at your face

[Refrain]

I feel how I feel cause I was born to kill
Ain’t no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I feel how I feel ’cause I was born to kill
The metal in your mouth like you was rocking braces

[Verse 4:Slaine]

I was on a crash course with the cemetery on a task force
Shooting for the skies, I’d do anything to blast off
Rewind it ‘99 fuck it now fast forward
If I could see today, this is everything I asked for
Back then I had nothing, I could rap my ass off
I’m on a corner spitting raps twisting caps off
Now here I am today, people, see this is what you asked for
Not the man, not the myth, I’m your superhero with his mask off
