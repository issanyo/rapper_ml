[Verse 1: Termanology]
I'm anti-give a fuck, I just live it up
That's how I'm livin' and my liver stay liquored up
Nightmares every night till I see the lights
The next day, I'm reborn comin' back to life
Stupid, the lead chunky and leave your head bumpy
I'm Ted Bundy in red monkeys, the Feds hunt me
I'm cocky now, I done toured in like every country
Rocky style, hit the bag then I get the money
The cause and effects to get cheques
And you only vexed, stab me 'cause you starvin' to death
Homie, the team got the fish and it's on point like the beam
Yeah, the inf', you a fiend, I'm the pitch
I'm a dream to your bitch, I catch her after the show
Her pussy gon' be filled up with semen and spit
I'm in Queens gettin' rich, but I rep the Bean till I'm stiff
LAW town where I lean with the clip

[Verse 2: Nems]
Yo, Term, it's however you want to call it
Movin' through this industry filled with homos and alcoholics
(Fuck outta here)
All they shit is garbage, just flush right down the toilet
These rappers is pussy, they see me comin', they clutch they wallets
(Oh shit, it's Nems)
But life is good, I ain't even gotta scheme now
Ridin' shotgun while Slaine cruisin' through Bean Town
I'm like, "Fuck merch", thousand Percs in my jeans now
Sellin' out at shows 'cause everybody's a fiend now
Should I walk away or should I put his whole team down?
I battle with myself, that's why I'm always fatigued down
Meanwhile, you was a pussy in the P now
Best friend was a rat like that French dude in The Green Mile
(Fuck outta here)
This just somethin' to ride to
Lookin' for a fix, you know that we can supply you
Nigga will rob you
Get stomped out by a bunch of niggas with B's on they hats
But no, we ain't Piru (Brooklyn, Boston)
Big guns with green lasers
Catch a nice scar from mean razors
I stomped 'em out this mornin'
Same day caught three cases
Pussy nigga, I'll break your jaw in three places
You fight like a bitch, write like a bitch
Put threes as E's, you even type like a bitch
I let my girl catch me cheat, told her fight for this dick
Gorilla motherfucker Nems, fuck your life in this bitch

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
I smoke you like rotor roasters
Drive-by like a rollercoaster with these loaded toasters
Oh, you don't know it's La Coka Nostra
Gorilla twins, primate villains
More bricks than Empire State Building
Peelin' banana clips to stay chillin'
My kicks worth more than your life
And this chain worth more than your wife
You better ask about orangutans that slang, my swhammy karang
Gun copper likes to ring, walk up on you, ba-bang
Who the fuck told you, you could breathe here?
I cut off your fuckin' nose with the broken bottle of Japanese beer
Then stick the rest up in your ass
Fuckin' with me, you'd rather eat a bucket of glass
Killers in gas masks and dad hats
Flippin' like lab rats on anthrax
A bunch of chrome Cro-Mag silverbacks
Ain't hard to find, you can catch us where gorillas at

[Verse 4: Slaine]
It was a long haul home to get back from where I've been at
Rats the size of dogs, roaches the size of rats
Schemin' with demons and ghosts and try to ride with that
Ask me how I've been
I'd tell you I'm survivin' this homicidal environment
The violent of silent, I'm in asylum, the siren of ominous [?]
The common knowledge you find in the modded mind of a tyrant
The sharp design of a Benz, not the [?]
The darkest side of my sins, they are not confined in this [?]
Blocked and I'm writin', impatiently waitin', vodka's invitin'
Mistake me for Satan, I'm not just cunnivin'
Awakin' and shakin' in Davy Jones' Locker beside him
Ridin' shotgun beside him, I'm outta my mind, Hell is collidin' with time
Feel when you're stuck in the past, future behind him
Knots in my stomach, rocks in my pocket, boxin', I'm fightin'
The night's gettin' darker, but watch for the lightnin'
