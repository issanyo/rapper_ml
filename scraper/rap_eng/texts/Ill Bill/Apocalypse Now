Verse 1: Sick Jacken]

Religion makes God the biggest reason for war
Before money and the power
Your hour of death was blessed a little more
Rigor mortis, bullets come like a killer chorus
Humming songs to the afterlife like psycho artists
My mind roams where the street’s heart is
I give my life to my people till I end up in a stone garden
Or hanged before I take a king’s pardon
If the grounds keep it street style
Will bet my the crowd it’s started
My sick squadron raised in Hell’s cauldron
In the belly of the beast where we’re murdering a pig sergeant
Blue soldiers walk in red paths with death masks
We’ll see it all in ceremony, massacres with bloodbaths
As long as apocalypse now, surreal battles in the end of time
Done Francis Coppola style
Ain’t no other way of stopping this trial
The dark only with the lights till my last breath
I’m wiping em out

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]

Stolen black American Express gone, drop bombs with it
God did it, here to blow up your fucking cars with it
Life’s cheap over here, I go to sleep no problem
After revolvers blow out what’s in between your ears
Scream to your ancestors, I pray to energy in the shape of an AK47
Blam faster than handcannons Damned families curse armies, kidnap generals
Watch em drown in the concrete
Grim reaper with the street sweeper when I creep up
Around the bend, found ten million in a green truck
The war chest, more death, more murder, more meth
More money, more weapons, more gangs, more sex
Morphine, methadone, heroin, and Viacom
Anti-brainwash, I leave the ground poured with riot cops
Notorious, scandalous, keep a banging bitch
Ill Bill psycho-realm, Brooklyn to Los Angeles

[Verse 3: Q-Unique]

The ghetto bird flies over the depths of extremes in search of a fugitive
Cornered ? burst into a shooting fit
Q the urban guerilla trained in the ? projects
Heaven’s terrorist, forever your God gets bomb threats
The face of the trifle spic, the brain of a rifle click
The rain and the lightning split on the frame of a sniper’s spit
The camouflage blam from the hands of God withstanding y’all
To be in branded in the sand by the vandal squad
I’m a freedom fighter with a weakness for Brazilian waxed putas
The back of the botanica (?)
They got the block taped off with no ways to escape or break off
In a chase with the state porks have walked into a face-off
Their eyes wide, they might try it, cut the gun and get their sides fired
And if they’re gonna run they’re only gonna die tired
Q-Unique the evil Anakin eyes bloodshot red
Face your demise on the other side of my gunshot dead
