[Intro:]
The pentagram has always been used, Satan worship, satanic worship, the five pointed pentagram
And if you take the arms off of the pentagram, you have a pentagon
And the United States' Pentagon is sitting exactly to north, aiming to north of the north star Thuban
Which is drawing power, according to the ancient egyptians for, for the god of war

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Anton LaVey Fu Manchu facial hair
Goons with the hateful stare
Move with palatial flare
Young Gary Busey but carry an Uzi
Young Cosby, hairy pussys and strawberry roofies
Young Ozzy, young pentagram, young Robby
Double septagram, rest in power to Prodigy
My living dead is like a snake on Medusa's head
Killers laugh like snakes while they shoot you dead
Billions drop brainwashed by foolish trends
Ha, [?] spray Glocks at you, shoot his head
Rest in power to Sean Price
Salute to my brother Vinnie, we all nice
I'm like Scorpio from Dirty Harry
I prefer it [?] I'll be murder happy
I'm the sorcerer supreme
You'll be murdered in your nightmares and tortured in your dreams

[Hook x4]
A little drug money never really hurt nobody, nobody

[Verse 2: Goretex]
They call me Captain Trips, Young Jerry
A hundred hits pure lysurgeon
Weed immersive, I roam the streets scheming for bleeding virgins
Use detergent and bundles and isotol, monsters brawl
Caprichaun and the goat
Young pentagram and matzah balls
Me and Bill rock wigs like Abel Ferrara
The coke cabo wabo private jet papi got the dope from heron
From Gustava, rocking Iommi jackets, fat mattress
Set a church on fire with catholics
I never went on my rackets
Rock a sadie shirt murder scene, plenty shades of dirt
I'm like a pagan cloak, 3:15 evade your turf
Tie your father up, and get the Tokyo blade, its double serrated Make his flesh a mess, sizzle like a slab of bacon
Buck 50 for the dope the pelicon took, mexican cooks, Billy Idol with heroin hooks
Flying Vs through your molly bags, running through customs
Got 40 pounds covered in polly bag, you started from nothing

[Hook x4]
