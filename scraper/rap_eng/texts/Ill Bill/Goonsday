Yeah. William cutting, check it

There's three stages of Free Masons
Green papers written in diseased hatred
Be patient, wait for the egyptian translation
David and Goliath at war, achieve greatness
Seen agents with biological agents in briefcases
Holy shit homie, this ain't what the prophecies of the Bible said
Leviathan, a cross between lucifer and a scientist
Sitting in a pentagram, octagon
Reading from the necronomicon with octomom
?fuck the fembot that shot Oscar Goldman
My operation costs six billion
Goddamnit you should've told them who I am
Ill Bill, goonsday, it's doomsday
The Forty-deuce black hebrew goonface, my tool spray
It takes forty-two muscles to frown
And only four to click the trigger of a four-pound
I'm falling down
My bullets'll melt your face like the end of Raiders
Pop your fucking cranium open like a baked potato
