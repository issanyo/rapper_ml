(Ill Bill)
I’m the creep in the mask, I snatch the disease from the lab
I chop my enemies in half with guillotines and laugh
I speak the language of anguish, popping off your top and splattering faggots
A fucking bloodbath of madness
When I’m mad I throw tantrums with automatics
Put pubescent bitches in torture attics
Worse than any thought you could imagine
Kidnapped an entire school of bible kids
The ransom is a stolen stash of black market software and microchips
I’ve learned to rob banks with lap tops, from the home of the have-nots
Where soldiers are drinking blood like tampons
We blood thirstier than vampires
Blessing the reverend head to toe spit the chrome until my hands tired

Chorus (Ill Bill) X2:
Reign In Blood, from a lacerated sky
Blastin guns and knives a hatred that you're fascinated by
Yo Its raining blood from a lacerated sky
Stab you in the eye fuck with me you guaranteed to die

(Necro)
I'm a robotic murderer with a computer in his spine
My creator has programmed me to kill you with a rhyme
Exterminate execute mangle and slaughter
Stab bludgeon rip to pieces that's my orders
Nothin human on earth could stop me
A tank blasting at my chest or my brain couldn't drop me
Adamantium armor wires and chips
Electricity running through my system makes me flip
My data base is filled with hate
Images of serial killers downloaded into my brain by tape
Berkewitz, Manson, Dahmer, Rifken
Gacey and Bundy I transform in an instant
To kill everything that lives
I got m16's attached to my metallic ribs
And I'm blasting all you government officials
Til your dead tissue its raining blood kid I'll kill you

(Chorus X2)

(Ill Bill)
Strife and death to all, loc’d the fuck out like Mike Concepcion
I bee drinking rubbing alcohol after the Henny gone
Morbid please slaughter sheep with walls that speak
New York streets are like amazing walls that bleed
Screaming like there was a crack addicted Newborn seed
Who's crackhead mother just died during delivery
The devils appearing bio engineering
Bio tech its godzilla versus god at the roman colliseum
Starting to peek want me in your apartment with freaks
While this bitch givin you brains peep the mark of the beast
From Canarsie to the East we be sparking the heat
A bunch of undead zombies and we starving to eat
Two thousand and seven lazer weapons carve into meat
Pulling up in front of your crib with a car full of creeps
Who gives a fuck if a cop is telling me to stop or to freeze?
I told them how to kill a cop so they shot the police

(Necro)
Yo my Glock will fire at your crotch I'll rip off your cock with pliers
And strangle it with copper wire
Then stomp it you bleed to death
Your dead body starts to stink like armpits when I murder I feel pompous
You'll get your ligaments drilled
Battling me is like a conflict with a convict my ignorance kills
When I go nuts bullets enter you like cinnamon fills
Entenmann's donuts they're delicious with milk
Your face is suspicious with guilt you'll be viciously killed
And your family's faces get slit and stitched like a quilt
You'll be rocking stilts like a gimp just like Larry Flint
Crippled with an electrical chair to be carried in
Depressed like Rob Steiger the tiger
Corroded like the vagina of a biker I don't like ya
Disgusting like being forced to tongue kiss
An old slut with no cold cuts covered in fungus

(Chorus X2)
