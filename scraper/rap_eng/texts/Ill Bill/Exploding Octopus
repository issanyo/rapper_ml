Intro:
[Female interviewer:] Don’t you think education should make people aware of the danger of the danger of technology instead of making them adapt more easily to any kind of progress and technology
[Male interviewee:] Absolutely, absolutely, that we can no long allow technology to come roaring down at us, I think we must begin to say no to certain kinds of technology and to begin technological change because we’ve now reach the point that the technology is so powerful that it could destroy us

[Verse 1]
He was accepted with Harvard at sixteen
Child prodigy
Math with specializing in complex analysis geometry
Earned a PHD in mathematics early
Youngest professor ever hired by UC in Berkeley
A short-lived position
He resigned in '69 with no apology
Without an explanation given
Social anxiety multiplied silently
Disconnected entirely from society
Built a cabin, became a survivalist
Rejected electricity and modern sciences
He cooked his dinner in a fire pit
And watched the stars from afar where Orion sits
The wilderness where the lions live
Primitive like the times of the giant pyramids the Mayans built
Then something caused his mind to chill
A course solidified successfully the very first time he killed

[Hook]
What would you do, how far would you go
If you thought that you can change the world for the greater good
How would you know
What’s right or wrong
Try to play God
Mail a bomb
To the CEO or the school or an airline
Do you justify murder for peace?
Do you believe that technology is the beast?
Imagine if your iPhone disappeared
That would be weird
Could you function in a world without technology
Or would you be scared?

[Verse 2]
Exploding octopus, block buster in the 6 finger hand
Booby trap a box to shock the populace with wishful plans
Initially ignored
"Industrial society and its future"
The manifesto of Kaczynski's war
Life in seclusion
Rivals and bruises
Rifles and UZIs
Devices with clues designed to confuse the FBI
Throw 'em off plans
Blowing off hands
Blinding people first
Soon the results were even worse
Became obsessed with teaching society a lesson
With home made weapons that reach society’s perception
The Washington Post and The Times finally printed his manuscript
That was the tipping point that notified his family
With suspicion leading to his arrest
His brother recognized his writing style and mission of death
Ran up in his cabin and discovered undeniable proof of his guilt
Sixteen bombs, twenty-three injured and three killed

[Hook]
