[Verse 1]
I make ruthless records consecutive
Disconnect your wig, wet you in your living room
Disrespect your crib, spit fire at you
Pop pop, cause your body to ooze
Bill, anything I spit's uncle Howie approved
There ain't no justice and there ain't no peace
These mean streets are like the evil dead eager to feast
Soul chasers will leave you diseased, what you get dealing with creeps
People sleep until we cause the desert eagles to speak
There's no love and no loyalty left
Learn ya lesson, the hood shot rich porter to death
Only the hood die young, rest in peace to Jam Masta Jay
Biggie and Pac, and all the rest who passed away
I'm like an animal, trying to survive
Striving for a better tomorrow, the world's full of terror and sorrow
Tears drop from a little baby boy or girl
While the push of a button could destroy the world

[Hook X2]
It's a overkill, no escaping this we raping this homie
It's a overkill, expose to nuclear radiation
It's a overkill, push the chromosone chromosplode
It's a overkill, peep the overfiend overload

[Verse 2]
Hit you with the nine shell in your head like Kleinfeld
My mind's swelled, I laugh at it like Seinfeld or Larry David
Then blast off like Larry Davis
We carry bangers and air you out like airplane hangers
I rock 5 star general status, projects to Paris
At the Hilton sticking foreign objects in Paris
I'm very paranoid tell me what they asked you? Splash you
Nuke you like fast food, splatter you when I clap tools
I keep it simple like grass roots, attack troops
Ghetto gorillas in track suits, wet up your whole shit like a bathroom
I catch fools slipping and hit 'em with capsules of blow cause cash rules
The truth newport carton junkies and street trash, wheat grass
Customers cop hundreds of weed bags
Yeah I was chosen to kill those who are smoking the krills
Sold it to you out the old seville, yo you know the drill

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3]
Go overboard, this is Ill Bill the overlord, go to war
I approach you with a trojan horse, entire armies are slaughtered
Explosions of gore, soldiers fall, hot enough to cause your bones to dissolve
Go through walls, Let the don use it, mix it with orange juice and abuse it
Throw your guns in the air and lose it, gangstas and goons with uzis
We underhanded money, rubberbanded the son of sam, son of man
People too stupid to understand, I'm the host with the most
Travel coast to coast, rolling like nostra coke, when I post the toast
Leave you wetter than PCP dispose of folks, loced out leave you with holes
Your clothes are soaked, you fucking shithead your thought process is idiotic
It gets worse blow a hole in your head, leave you retarded, look at you know
Stupid fuck see what you started, I won't stop till all of are dearly departed

[Hook X2]
