[Hook - repeat 2X]
Tell me where the fuck I went wrong?
Took the wrong turn, wrong path
What's Wrong With Bill? - Inspired by swords to kill
Coldhearted, how can a person be taught to feel?
Thoughts concealed by shield of alcohol and pills

[Verse 1]
God is an atheist, why should I believe in religion?
I'd rather get my dick sucked and cook ki's in the kitchen
Drive-by, leave you on your block bleeding and twitching
Break bread with demons and witches, I'm evil and twisted
Half of us in jail, the other half in Beemers and Sixes
CEOs wondering who let these creeps in the business
Creep with the biscuit, I'm heroin the fiends are addicted
Life's the American Nightmare - the dreams of the wicked
We cry blood, sniff cocaine and die young
Time's up, caught up in the blowjobs and mindfucks
The metal that killed my enemies, occupy guns
Say goodbye cause you only die once
My mind's grotesque, it's so ugly, so focused, so hungry
Trust me, young Gene Simmons, getting between women
Ill Bill - solo album, Howie gon' take it
Leave you duct taped and stuck in the Matrix

[Hook - repeat 2X]

[Verse 2]
Two women love me, one gave birth to me, nurtures me
The other one don't understand me
Sometimes she wanna murder me, sometimes she wanna marry me
I pray that my sanity grab me, it ground me
I think that I'm about to go AWOL, lose my shit
As reality slips away I'm starting to lose my grip
No smile is genuine or real
I find myself losing faith in every thing and every person that I hold dear
I'm in a bad place, who do I trust?
I don't trust myself, how the fuck I'm gonna trust you?
If I don't love myself how the fuck I'm gonna love you?
I made this album to reveal my inner thoughts and discuss truth
What does life mean without death?
Would you appreciate the sunlight without the darkness?
Would I appreciate my grandmother raising me if she had never passed away
So many things I never had the chance to say when she was here
I see you when I get there
I hope that there's a heaven even though I know I'll probably burn in hell, I lived there
It couldn't get much worse I guess
Suicidal thoughts, I think that I've become obsessed with death
And I know it's fucked up, but yo I'm trying hard so get the fuck out my face
I'll work it out myself, it's my problem, I'll solve it
Picking up the pieces of a life shattered
I never knew my life mattered
