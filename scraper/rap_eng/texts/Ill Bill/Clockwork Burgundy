[Intro]
Get your hands up, fast! This is a stick-up! Reach!
Indeed, I shall reach!

[Verse 1: Goretex]
Rock Cliff Burton Vest precision murder like Phil Hartman
Human delis on farragut complete with all the garnishes
Left lane Belt Parkway hold the wheel yo don’t let it spill
Wave a work on the rail scale then we movin’ to the Seville
Mortuary gloves baggin’ dope in the vestibule
Came a long way now we mix orange acid and edibles
Rap Mickey Knox I’m the rabbi with the killer locks
Packages of white we got our training on stove tops
Likes to get her hair pulled the 80’s coke we called it Air Wolf
Locked my brain in the synagogue, no candles
We the Tel Aviv got me Vito Genovese
Walking like Lee Van Cleef on killer keef
I’m like Porky from dope fiends sell junk like Sanford
Ain’t talkin’ ‘bout garbage with them packets of Pampers
Serve fiends like Pete Sampras
Headbands filled with coke max KD shaes no safety
Uzi under the coat

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
That Clockwork Burgundy, my Glock work perfectly
That cop shot nervously and got popped purposely
Blood bath in Living Color like Vernon Reid
Sherming the weed burner with beam murder sprees
Can't quit like Vincent D'Onofrio, we mafia fuck outta here make a fucking schmuck outta ya
Billy from 5714 Farragut, arrogant plus talented
Became a cult leader like Manson did
El Magico add cats in the pastrami hole (?)
Mass hooked up the root (?)
It feels like Howie’s home
Like ’83 in Canarsie
Camaro’s on every block rest in peace to Artie
I’m that innovation syntax in the matrix
Witchcraft in the basements skin grafted by Satan
Forever meant to destroy mics
My destiny on board stripes rest in peace Sean Price
