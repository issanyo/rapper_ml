[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
I'm not for conscious trade
I'm from the honest days of robbing chains and bombing trains
I operate differently: me and them are not the same
There is no law except the law of the beast
And the beast choose war over peace
Until all are deceased
Treachery is a virtue
Your best of friends'll turn to enemies and hurt you
Discredit you and curse your mother or God
Escape past lies through heaven's gate
Son of Saddam raped another mans wife on her wedding day
Police massacres to chiba traffickers
The beast is after us
The reaper laughs at us
Peeing through catheters
Shit through colostomy bags after violently stabbed
Vegetables connected to respirator tubes until the very end
Until the light is gone at the end of the tunnel
Delivering death to everything and everyone that ever loved you
Quotable madness, socially anxious soldier assassins
Skull full of maggots and a soul full of anguish

[Hook x2: ILL Bill]
Fresh out the box, crispy innovators
Pull out in busy elevators
And spark shootouts on escalators
Fire AK's from fire escapes
And rock the stage like a live grenade and got paid
Listen!

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
They sought to overpower me
Let the sickness in me just devour me
Listening to Bathory with Billy in the Bowery
The shotgun pump and the raw white empower me
Me Cult Leader and Slaine careless alchemy
I'm more hungry now cause I have another mouth to feed
Trying to kill this motherfucker, Operation Valkyrie
When Crypt got sick everything went south for me
Now this motherfucker got better and he out with me
Fuck whoever doubted me, all of y'all are gone
And y'all can't overstand how it's Apocryphon of John
Worshiping the energy and honoring the storm
Yet I'm a part of Mossad and honoring Islam
My son everything to me, he undoubtedly shining
And he walk with the aura of a powerful shaman
He either gonna be a writer or possibly rhyming
Ryan Marciano Terrence, the heart of a lion

[Hook x2: Ill Bill]
Fresh out the box, crispy innovators
Pull out in pissy elevators
And spark shootouts on escalators
Fire AK's from fire escapes
And rock the stage like a live grenade and got paid
Listen

[Verse 3: Slaine]
It's been so many years, I've been caught up in this game
Must've had it in my blood, I was brought up in this vein
Wrong at every level, momma thought I was insane
Brought my life between the lines and remained recordings of the pain
To here for my spirit giving order in my brain
Deception is distorted and it's always been the same
So I accepted no shortage in the blame for the losses
Now it's all water in the drain
Fighting these forces, crawling in my skin
Brawling with the things that made me, this is all I ever been
But I'mma take it home for the win
Come back with the Gods who atone for the sins
Hold chrome with the kings
Survivors that's been dying to [?]
Riding with that heavy metal that we're liable to pull
There's a bad moon rising in the skies and it's full
Passion for life as seen through the eyes of the wolf
