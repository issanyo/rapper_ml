[Hook]
I found out that I was, too young, not grown
I was, not ready for a world so cold
I was, not prepared to make it on my own
I was, not ready for what life unfolds
And it was, too much, too soon
I couldn't tell if what I felt was false or true
I didn't think about what I'm about to do
I'm on some, this couldn't be real this can't be true

[Verse 1: Hero]
I was too young, but these my people, so that's okay though
I was down for anything, I'd do it if they say so
Look how they cookin' it up, I'd sit and watch their cake grow
Watching Robbie in the corner, he there snorting yeyo
And everybody acting cool like that right there's okay though
So I walk over to him, and I'm like yo hey bro
What the fuck are you doing? Get away from the table
He like, this ain't nothing but a little bit of the yeyo
I got it covered plus I make the profit from sales
He acting like he hadn't heard not one of them tales
The dopest brother, knocked him and they took him to jail
There go another, this hustler here was destined to fail
Convicted, but the last I heard he tried to appeal
And Eric, he gone he wilding, busting his steel off at the popo
These are the trial and tribulations of kids trying to act like grown folks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
I was, too young to fall in love like Motley Crue
Too young, I pulled a gun and I shot this dude
It was over a girl, foolish pride, I was crucified
Just another youthful juvenile, doing time
Forgive me mama, I never meant for you to cry
Went to trial, I was sent to do a two to five
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
And I ain't no punk, here you fix your face or get your face fixed
Facelift, predicate cutter, you get you face ripped
They'll bust your shit wide open and make you leak
You better chill out, before I birthday cake your feet
Not a bad guy, I don't wanna catch mad time
So I chill with work release in the back of my mind
But the guy that I popped wasn't dead
He's locked up in here now too and wants revenge
I got shanked in my bed!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slaine]
I was too young to say no, too young to yell nope
Old enough to taste anger but not enough to smell hope
Thirteen years old, my beloved mother had just passed
I started puffing grass, drinking forties, cutting class
My father always used to beat on me and bust my ass repeatedly
I couldn't wait to get a change of scenery
I never had a dream: nobody believed in me
These mean streets are the only thing I've seen defeat
I'm sixteen being free, chewing vics and percs
Caught a OC habit quick, and my life got worse
Cause now I'm sick unless I get a pill, so my head is filled
With deep schemes, my tolerance: I let it build
But when street dreams and quick cash is difficult
You find you get the same high cheap from sniffing dope
Now I'm shooting with the neighborhood people
Nobody could save me from evil, I'm a slave to the needle
I'm too young!
