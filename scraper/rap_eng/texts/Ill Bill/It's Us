[Hook x4]
It's the N-O-N, P, H, I, X, I-O-N

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
What does that spell? It spell Non Phixion my friend
The Future Is Now, nuclear shower y'all powerball
I devour all, buildings collapse, towers fall
Killers with gats, millions of carnivores start the war
I shoot rocket launchers riding on dinosaurs
Flying saucers meet the Bible's author
Reveal alien tribal culture
Who designed our DNA structure?
Genetic functions were we made in a laboratory or Godâ€™s construction
Now bust the combustion Big Bang
Gangbangers that spit slang
Be the truth, not that King James version they teach in schools
Jesus knew, he was thugged out too
A bugged out dude, a loose cannon
In my future we use Magnums, bombs and explosions
I spit like Muhammed to Moses
Ganja smokin', thoughts in constant motion, my mind is ferocious
I spit for gangstas and maniacs that defy prognosis
It's Ill Bill, my reality's my psychosis

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2: Goretex]
What does that spell? It spells Non Phixion my friend
A brave new world, that's safe for all gods and men
Bars of phlegm so therapeutic it's part of the end
The way I spit pain it's hard to pretend, hardly depends
Sticking up delis for quick chips and starving again
Our marketing plans guarantee I'll be parking a Benz
My words are like carcinogens, we be starting the trends
I sharpen the edge with sixteen bars to defend
The arm, leg, leg, arm, head God is haShem
Non Phixion extra-terrestrials, Martians with Tims
Smart as the dead, we at war with the Narcs and the Feds
Uncle Howie sparkin' the stem with the positive grin
Napalm shots, Israeli camo, ammo with the car bomb
I don't exist, close the garage and leave the car on
Amen, suicide watch, and state pen
Street trilogy, one love, I'll see you again

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
What does that spell? It spells Non Phixion my friend
These predicaments got me thinking of spitting again
Lived a thousand lives, died a thousand deaths
Been on house arrest
Lost control, tortured soul depressed
Watch how foul it gets
Suicidal thoughts, wrists slit, it's overdose
Wigs split, mixed with coke, fix the rope, I'm comatose
Eyes bulging, mind swollen, my spirit left the physical
Burning skin, return again, redeem the breath of miracles
We're born suspects, we love porn sex
The drug Ex make the thugs get wild and bust sets
Like a gangsta, our music stimulates your brain
Make you wanna bang, some start to create change
I'm hard to breathe, just before the gods and the thieves
If we want peace then why is it so hard to achieve?
I believe in us, while you faggots sleep on the gods
Uncle Howie, Non Phixion bitch, we beating the odds
