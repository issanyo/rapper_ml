[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Holy shit, they tried to torture me, three officers bleed nauseously
They eating pork and beans and involved in Pagan sorcery
Super vegan, heard your crew is beefing, now goons is creeping
Hebrews blacker than Zulus and Guidos rocking wife-beaters
DT's rocking FUBU up in the ninth precinct
Rusty-pipes no-bar types scheming through life cheating
Seen the pig get shot in the face for the right reasons
Find a way to civilize a trife heathen
The ILL Bill collective Suicide King, my sound's a hard drug
We God’s thugs, popping off guns, you lost blood
Like you lost your head
Talking to me is like having your fortune read
By a fourth century sorcerer that tortures men
Then try to walk the subway platform with gats drawn
Like a postal worker coming home drunk and just lost his job
That’s what we dealing with in Roman times
I never liked school, those fucking devils always told me lies
And tried to brainwash, but read the value
Everybody fucking hates cops
And if you blasted one you gained props
Hyper shit, Roddy Piper shit, tiger-striped and sniper shit
Picture me selling my fly shit for five percent
Fuck that! I be on top going for delf
Twelve-thousand units, then I sold another twelve
"I Shot Reagan" was the joint that sparked the tight chaos
Like stray shots that spray cops, break up the séance

[Verse 2: Jise One]
Aye, white doves are shot, watch war menace your spot
Main niggas are clocked out cause the underground exploit hot
Melting pots of vandals, four angles to stop you fake frauds
Forward to get the sawed-off, welcome to get your Timbs sawed
I'm a lyric evangelist, I never turn the cheek
I tore it off the case, It ain’t sweet, sour to hot piece
Speak to hear your half-ass multiplied by two, boo
Niggas are anal, through the butt they learn to chew food
Spit it out, you talk shit cubed, your rhymes are obtuse
Soon you see me split ways, seven to get the high shroom
Zoom as a power check your lady flashing sideways
Battle you for the saddle, lost the rhythm to foreplay
Nasty king interpret, take delicate, passionate swimmers
Senator to all religious sects, tremor to any bigger
Trigger to mental pistol power, shower your appearance
Clearer, shatter the nearest foul play, who wanna feel this?

[Verse 3: Goretex]
Religious campsites, take my advice, this Game of Life
Holy nights like Hanukkah lights amid your gunfights
Tel Aviv with laser sight, Platoon shit, yo we move shit
Left-wing cats straight out of goon flicks
So Uncle Howie gave them pigs a chase
We here to fit the states, Glenwood Projects made trainer's base
Y’all can’t emerge in a safe place
I turn energy into sensory data in high rates
WHT your TVs and CDs
LSD flash, kill my landlord for seven G’s
Tangle with my clique?
I’ll leave you shackled from your dick
Mexican Magic, pass the peyote and extra clip
Yo, I was bred with a tortured head
Connected with the dead
Kabbalah readings; we conquered then fled
Cashless society awaits us, forever trace us
You bore me sort of like KISS without the makeup

[Verse 4: Q-Unique]
Incineration of your whole Generation X
Next context sounded similar to top ten
Must stop when I drop panic and sink with rhyme thinking
Iceberg your brain state, got your mind sinking
Open like the Fat Beats sign blinking
Consider it illiterate, you can’t read between the lines
I’m ten times the pen rhymes you write on blue lines
Exaggerated existence of commercial sounds
Like pussy politicians got political prisoners locked down
Knock down and hit you with the impact of a penny
Tossed off the observation deck of a skyscraper
I spy my paper like a board of secret cult
The vital data that can shatter government bodies
Rock parties like a boulder rolling through a nightclub
One might bug at the fact that fourteen years of rap
Only got me underground dap
I’m past that like I missed my stop on the A-Train
Here’s the weight gain from the great brain
Pass the spray paint!
