Ill Bill, spit the real
What the dilly yo?
The name's Bill

What up Bill!

[Verse 1]
Dropping screen tanks, driving cars
Jack you out your green Benz
Drop the top, take a deep breath then I begin
The way the world bounces
Fuck a nickel bag, we burn ounces
You a gangsta?
Fuck shootin' you, we burn houses
Have you runnin' out your crib, butt naked with a half a brick
Hangin' out your asshole, lookin' like an asshole
Fussin' with me, guarantee homicide
Devil and God collide
Why you wanna make your mamma cry?
Hang you with shoelaces, Doomsday
A free thinker, squeeze the trigger like its tooth paste
The game's different now, the rules changed
It's like who's broke and who's paid?
Who's dope and who's played?
Who's smoke and who's sprayed?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Reverse a back exit
Drive ya car, jack you out your black Lexus
Drop the top and sell crack wreckless
A loaded gun's cool, but yo I wanna own a judge too
A gun plus a judge equals blow me and fuck you
Get it where you fit in
Cause dummy recognize dummy
Pussy recognize pussy
And money recognize money
Gangsta recognize gangsta
And you faggets is funny
Tens years slangin' crack and you cats is still bummy
Whack rappers I be snatchin' your fade
Snathin' your chains, snatch up all your ice
Then empty my gat in your brain
You never heard of me?
Word, you cats is insane
Ill Bill motherfucker, dare to challenge the name

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bless the Lord in heaven
Try to hijack a seven-forty-seven
A terrorist, hardcore forever
These other cats is makin' dance-music
My music make you bust gats to it
Shoot at your feet to make you dance to it
Bill's Ill, Bill smoke weed, Bill smoke blunts
Bill guzzle Hennessey and Bill smoke dust
Bill hates cops, still gots to get my props
Don't get too close because you might get shot

[Hook]
