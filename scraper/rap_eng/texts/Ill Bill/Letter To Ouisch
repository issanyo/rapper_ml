[Verse 1: Ill Bill]

What up kid?
Been thinking 'bout you doing my bid
After the pigs threw me in jail, that was groovy what you did in Hawaii
You were always my favorite of all the girls
Happy you got away and blended back into the world
Remember your old man?
He was far out
Loved the Orange Sunshine
And learned to worship me at George Spahn's house
Remember old George named the entire ranch
Squeaky tried to assassinate President Ford, but got nabbed
But you never lied to me, neither did she either
My evil divas
A buncha real eager beavers
You can't fake the realness
The real's never fakeness
Never hate the greatness or ever debate this
Remember Dennis Wilson?
Too bad he drowned
He was there when I put acid in your daddy's mouth
Then I gave you wine
Then I ate your mind
Your trippy hippy, cult leader guy
Made you mine
