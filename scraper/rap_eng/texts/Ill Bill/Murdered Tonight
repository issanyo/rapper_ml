[Slaine]

He's still here after all these years with the lost sinners
Cold blood stay frost from the north winters
Henny spilling out his cup on his four fingers
Battle voices in his head saying "You're Finished"
Soul feeling like the old rust on the door hinges
Whores throat, beat up and raspy like a tour singers
The past wishing in his glass in the course lingers
Flashing memory every splash of hennesy
Heavy cash and enemy semi blast the ?enesi?
Answers back your messages bending back and hemorrhaging
Men in black with menacing looks meet the crooks fate
The simmering in his eyes until it cooks hate
The future's looking grimmer
He's feeling him or me while he's lookin in the mirror
And maybe God forgive him or he don't
This kid is thinking he gon see the morning living but he won't

[Hook: Slaine]
Somebody's getting murdered tonight
Somebody's gotta pay for this year
Somebody's gotta pay for this life
Somebody's getting murdered tonight

[Ill Bill]

He's still here after all these years, with the derelicts
Black army jacket terrorist, remenis
Overfallen soldiers, brothers in arms ?????
Rumbling war, where OGs crumble and fall
In a blizzard of bullets might have been a hundred or more
Bullet hole puncture the wall then rupture your skull
Fucking animals in the deadliest jungle of all
Disgusting cannibals eating eachothers mothers ofcourse
Hanger slit her throat throw a bucket under her corpse
Disrespect the dead fuck without a crutch of remorse
Witness death another life crushed like dust in a storm
Pistols dressed with silencers to muffle applauds from the clapper
The future's looking grimmer
He's feeling him or me while he's lookin in the mirror
And maybe God forgive him or he don't
This kid is thinking he gon see the morning living but he won't
