[Hook: Raekwon sample]
Walked in, both of us looked like terrorists
Walked in, both of us looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, dun yo, I handle this

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
When y’all was fucking around with Bush I was running with Saddam
Puffing on the kush and building with the imam
The only thing you motherfuckers set was the alarm
I’m stronger than the motherfucking Tet in Vietnam
Whoever wanna knuckle up will be deformed
Praying to the altar of the church and reading psalms
I don’t mean weapons when I say that I’m dealing arms
I chop a motherfucking body up and feed the dogs
Me and Billy ain’t even deities we the gods
You a faggot, we the OGs that’s in the yard
Only a select few believe in Fard
The rest gonna meet with Shaitan to bleed and starve
Left hook astronomy, you seeing stars
If I ain’t in the studio drunk I be in bars
Bill buck-fifty this pussy and leave a scar
You might own a team, believe the league is ours

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
He was the keeper of the seven keys, eighteen a brick
A hundred and twenty-six thousand in a briefcase, give me my shit
It had the look that said, “I am the power”
The white angel with a scorpion branded across the particles of powder
Martyrs in the tower, owls, apocalyptic hour
Sound of pistol shower, crowning a system that devour
Mysticism shrouded in whispers, profound with an interest
Push a button and blow you up with a bomb from a distance
Like for instance in the parked car across from the precinct
Looking out my window watching your window falling to pieces
Bombing emergency, counterinsurgency, serpents flee
Furnished by me, sponsored courtesy of the murder spree
Using religion, science versus superstition
Came from the future to teach us how we overthrew the system
He lost an eye and several fingers on his right hand
Letterbomb sent to him by unidentified fans
The truth was never revealed, he retired to an island near Fiji
So his past would never reappear
Or so he thought until he caught some unidentifiable virus
They say he has five weeks to live

[Hook x2]
