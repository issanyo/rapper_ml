[Intro Scratches]
After we get all that technical stuff out of the way
We'll hop online and check out some of the amazing things you can do
Out there in cyber space
Dial up
Log in
I'm on the net
I thought you were gonna teach me how to get on the Internet
You're right I better explain

[Verse 1: Snak the Ripper]
Yeah
They trynna drop a pin on my location
Hit me with some pop up, some polling information
Driving me insane with these push notifications
Send me corny meme posts to get me motivation
Man, opinions ain't shit when they hide behind a keyboard
Attach a wire from my modem to a brick of C4
Your mama on a webcam, I spam in her inbox
She ugly when I'm sober, I don't notice after ten shots
Rappers buying fake fans and lying on the mic
Fucking staring at their Instagram and crying over likes
Well I'm trying not to LOL
They trolling on my Spotify
Loading up the Google map to find the perfect spot to die
All these advertisements trynna make me broke
The Internet need to learn how to take a joke
I just get mad love and these fakes get choked
'Cause nobody gives a fuck about they Facebook posts, nope

[Hook]
Fuck, the Internet
Fuck, the Internet, the motherfucking Internet
Fuck, the Internet
Fuck, the Internet, the motherfucking Internet
How about that world wide web, fuck that

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Yo, Snak told me fuck the Internet
I told him I already did
Back when Myspace pussy became a trendy thing
Before Tinder or Christian Mingle
Before the Craigslist killer
This shit was pretty simple
Till I sent a dick pic to this bitch that was batshit
Pretty pics, big tits but that bitch was catfish
On Jdate she was the jewy Loni Anderson
Our date, she looked like Louie Anderson, damn son
So fuck the Internet, you must be stupid
Fuck eHarmony to fuck OkCupid
Fuck Photoshop and fuck personal computers
Married to marijuana but always in search of Buddha
Met this new bitch on my phone, she work for Uber
Snapchat cracker the proper taught maneuvers
Young and perverted, others prefer cougars
Give me a real life dime-piece, rocking a shirt from Hooters
Yeah

[Hook]
Fuck, the Internet
Fuck, the Internet, the motherfucking Internet
Fuck, the Internet
Fuck, the Internet, the motherfucking Internet
How about that world wide web, fuck that

Fuck, get off the fucking phone, fuck!
I'm trying to use the Internet
