[Verse 1: Necro]

Dirty deeds get done dirt cheap for 2Gs
Blades inserted deep in your throat, murdered in your sleep
Rock you like a hurricane, a berzerk fighter
Old school like Dirkschneider, pants tighter than a vagina
I used to rock Northface and polos
Puffing a spliff in the PJs, bumping Cliff Burton bass solos
Rugged like Dickinson on Trooper [?]
Demons to get you, Diamond, Simmons, and Cooper
You're homosexual on some Marilyn shit
The plan is to damage you like Vinnie [?] on the kit
You'll get beat up, all of human destiny's fucked
I love metal, rep it to Death, rest in peace Chuck
The Final Countdown, lots of depression
Your beats are weak, your clique is flotsam and jetsam
I'm like Skolnick, doing arpeggios that saw through your head
Piggy, you'll live forever like the back [?]

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]

We raise up, like bullets out of arrows
Like kings and pharaohs, live in the shadows
We the poison in the tip of an assassin's arrow
Your demise will be the death of an asshole
Of a fucking douchebag, you're the perfect example
Get murdered and trampled, stomped into the dirt
Anybody makes a move, and everybody gets hurt
I'm like gamma radiation; reputation's the cornerstone of respect
Disrespect, I'll put a fucking hole in your dome or your chest
Coke is the best, it'll make you more money than Jesus
And turn your heart colder than ice that's up in your freezer
I'm like Mao Zedong and Joe Stalin, exploding violence
Suck my dick on a throne [?] and diamonds
Have my own people destroyed, raped, and shredded
A combination of Ho Chi Minh, Hussein, and Lenin
The Circle of Supertyrants in a race for weapons
Pay for your love and you always shall remain a legend

[Verse 3: Goretex]

Into the void, I stab you till your skin is destroyed
[?]
Goretex to Mega Therion flesh and gore
Into Crypt of Rays Iâ€™m a drifter, I shall be reborn
Feast on the carcass like Bill Steer
From the projects, strong to the morgue dog
I'm like acid, I kill fear
Cause of destiny, caught with your face splattered
Incision mechanic, Travis Bickle sick with a magnum
The addict for killing, my works all displayed in the city
Kabala appetite, initiation burns on their titty
I'm like the mad scholar, cutting through chicks is groovy
Fuck with the goons, pump .22 in your kufi
Young Cronos handing over doses to groupies
Mind control with a cloak like a flash from a bad movie
Loose edits, during credits, it's just me and the Uzi
Executioner, hang those fuckers in shacks in the boonies
