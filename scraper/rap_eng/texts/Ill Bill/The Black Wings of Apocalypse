[Ill Bill]
The black wings of apocalypse, designer of viruses
Cabana bolan psoriasis, undeniable nihilist
Stab you with ice, thermal nuclear damage device
Uncle Howie and thirty goons gangbanging your wife
Born to fuck the whores of Babylon, morbid marathon
It's torture man of God, lost his religion, torn and cast aside
The monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Images of twisted and disfigured lips and heads visits him in bed
Witnesses have said, he never had a conscious
Laughed in private of arrays insatiable appetite for random violence
Laced with hollows in the age of quarrel
My brains is like a runaway train with outrageous cargo
Beware thou what protects me was made to harm you
I'm the architype forever be displayed in marble
Half logical the other half insane and horrible
The combination of cash, cocaine and prostitutes

[Goretex]
I keep it goremet, emptying clips in broad day
Kicking your door I'm emtpy like the mourge of Lavey
Disappearing acts where magic's panoramic on K?
My display theatres of fortress, all my whores are the stage
Ducktape and drillbits, tied-up titties enslaved
Murder you with the same hand I piss with whipping out blades
Love butcher rap Randy Rhoads, More axes than overlook
Hooks and disturbing buckets of blood hung for the hoes to look
Desolate, never trust a killer on meth
With a grimace is like Vandross and a hammer like Richard Speck
Inverted crosses, vision of moses holding his chest
Vampurity to southern road with her teeth all up in his flesh
She cornerised I left breast for the ritual affixation ?? flex tested by criminals
City of in the stream my chi is invisible
The world is gonna know my name, not just the physical

[Mr. Hyde]
Let the bludgeoning begin, fuck your blood caked Carcasses
Bucking through your skin empty AK cartridges
Unsanitary severed limbs circulate
Under mud buried deep Cops will find your vertebrae
Got lockpicks for latches, aerosol and matches
Amputation time with broadswords and hatchets
Splatterfest, bloodfeast, carnival of corpses
The soundtrack to mourges where the coroner is nauseous
Tyrant's asylum, screwdrives and knives in
Necks til you rest in death from the violence
Can't call my dogs off sickles and sawzalls
Slice you like doctors cut umbilical cords off
I'm on you like sawed off, spitting at point blank
More rugged than warlords inflicting a groin shank
Horsemen with every bloody fetish in the book
Hands holding meathooks getting ready to jux

[Necro]

Good evening we serving horsemeat with seasoning
Diseased and bleeding with lesions force-feed you excretion
Releaving your starving pain like carpenter I'm carving veins
Close your curtains I'm lurking like maggots and larva in drains
I'm alone in space, cloning a race of demons
That'll break every bone in your face your dome in a brace
Blaze a path through the nation quick praise the map
Give you a razorbath like an asian exploitation flick
Machetes scalp your meat, this beat is molten heat
Compete with my fleet I shred you like Garry Holt on Leeds
For kids that do shit on the block, shooting cops
To billions in future stocks, I strangle you with putrid socks
I only fuck with vicious bitches, snitches get stitches
Then they get chopped up in one of Albert Fish's dishes
Burn you with heat like the equator's cross
My laser turn you into cremated puffs, disintegrate to dust
