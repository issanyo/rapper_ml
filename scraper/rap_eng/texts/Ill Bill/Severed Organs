[Verse 1: Necro]

The General of graphic violence, bludgeoning, hold grudges, stab shit up wildness No one budges vileness, wireless, tireless, jabbin' to ya grill, bust it up stylish, grabbing for the kill fuck you up nihilist
Atheist, anarchist manifesting my destiny of monarchy through morbid malevolence like capitalists, who pops caps at the capital
I got an immaculate list of people that need to be killed accurately, like a stake being driven through Dracula, G, precisely murder you [?] spectacularly
Moving like electricity through New York City, expect shitty attitudes when you visit my city, we talk gritty
Murdering people on a mic, we'll be murdering people in person if we like if that person's [?]
If you're a virgin of bleeding emergency room style, urgently we'll introduce your circuitry to a surgeon

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]

Slaves of pain, on Devil's Island like Dave Mustaine, songs remain deranged, my sanitarium is the stage
Doomsday for the deceiver, the cult leader these legions of true believers of obedient shooters with heaters
Listen, it's my heritage to rule the world, my army of heretics shall consume the earth
Of an uncontrollable storm of abusive words, ideologies of the perverse in Lucifier's church
Rape you with chainsaws orgies with strange whores, fucked her in the mouth until her face tore I innovate gore
Then made up pistols and porn, [?] baseball bats and a dick of a horse
I'll have your gatekeeper licking the floor, face down ass up ugly you love it bitch listen some more
Hypocritical shithead smile send it through door, unable to stop my apocalyptic mission of war
We push buttons and piss stupid people off, beat up your favorite rappers we incorrect, politically of course, circle of tyrants, personify murder and violence and that white powder you love when it burns in your sinus

[Verse 3: Mr Hyde]

Homicidal recital, an ice pick in ya vitals, when I be spittin' these scripts that's contradctin' the bible
See, I'm a straight up disease, with a blade up my sleeve, we known of spraying police put your brain in a freeze
Some street serpentine fiend caught a murder at thirteen and certainly burst threes skin under your shirt bleeds
Tossed over a bridge no remorse for my sins, go find your corpse in a fridge and toss forth the drinks
In a torturous bliss, I'll put this fort in your tits, screamin [?] from my fists like a porcelain dish
It's impossible for every doctor to be stitching every wound, they'll be rockin' your name in an obituary soon
Perform your autopsy speaking in tongues, discard your arteries, heart, teeth, and your lungs
We distribute types of death that ain't never been dealt, I'll stick you with an icicle so the evidence melts

[Verse 4: Goretex]

Blood farmer with the burgundy smock, I got a got a piece of [?], thirty-five years left in a box, ready to rock
Murdering junkies, straight chillin', my coffin is here often, drillin' coffins turnin' to cold, limpin' the corpses
Drug orgies keep the morphine drips, ignore the winds all I hear is metal dumping out clips pumping out hits
Till my ears bleed, we eat through your chops, fuck calling cops, I'm like the birdman [?]
I've been drillin who went ballistic in [?], fourty Glocks saw me in butcher shops with torture props
The gore zenith over drums like behemoths so sick of body parts [?] anemics
Blood squirts on speakers on stage with cleavers, nobody is as evil as us this game is full of diseases
Dirty page blushed kicked up blood in your carpet you know a man smell piss on your corpse like a [?]
Carving into your belly with forks got flesh in his office, hands of a dentist mutilated but never nauseous
