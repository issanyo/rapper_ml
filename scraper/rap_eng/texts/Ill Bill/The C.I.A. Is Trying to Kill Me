[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Non-Phixion be the real hip hop
We make you wanna kill cops
Cats hate me, cause they know I fingered their girls' twat
They feel helpless, real jealous, we killed Elvis
I shot Reagan with the help of the secret service
Super double agent, shoot your mother with my brother's favorite
12 gauge waving, aiming at your brain, strange universe, I'm too famous
Leaving the murder scene blameless, drug entertainment
Thugs that'll blaze with laser guns
Saying what I wrote, they feel what I feel
They see the same picture
We make the biscuit do the talking and became richer
Nobody gets a record deal, you gotta take that shit
Treat the record label like a slut, and rape that bitch
I keep it simple for these stupid cats
Claiming you knew the facts, but in reality, you were trapped
Jesus Christ was a gangsta rapper
They killed him then he came back and made a platinum album
The path I travel's like the dragon shadow
Invisible to CIA camera angles
They got a file on every rap group
They killed the last man who had proof
They're after me for information that I have too

[Hook: Ill Bill]
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I might have to blast you
The CIA's trying to kill me, we bad news
Get the fuck up out my way when I pass through
I'm paranoid, tell me what the fuck they asked you
You fuck around with me and I might have to blast you
The CIA's trying to kill me, we bad news
Fuck around with Non Phixion, that's a bad move

[Verse 2: Sabac Red]
Symbolism, socialism, live life, lead, learn
Struggle war whole drug fiends, the white house burn
Sex, pain, fear, freedom love, young guns be shootin'
Genocide, revolution, lost souls prostituting
Military confrontation, safe sex and masturbation
Peace to all the homeless people livin in the train station
Project wars, building one vs four
Lock the door, burn the disc now everybody hit the motherfuckin floor
They bust and I'm a glutton for this shit
I'm number six on they list next to Kiss and Marley's kids
Cause I run wit Asians, Latinos and Black fists
5 percenters, Caucasians, thugs who live communist
They broke in my house, planted bugs in all my lamps and my couch
They after me (what?!) let me find out
I'm not havin it, my rap attract the service like a magnet
The bastards get nothing like private parties with no laminates
If I'ma die, I'ma die bustin and strugglin'
I'm hustling for the people, fuck them devils and corruptions
Nuttin' for nuttin', ain't it something how they do?
They ID me due to my tattoo

[Hook: Ill Bill]

[Verse 3: Goretex]
Projects for straight jackets, electroshock states
A rock could fall out, traded for royalty rates
Get ya' drink on, we building bombs, spit in ya face
Smart to change cars like cruise the block I do it for chase
Nice spite work, the fancy knife work
Hit to Christ Non-Phixion striking prison Ice shirts
I paid dues, nothing to loose, Steady bustin' off weapons In 2's
When I come home I be smellin' shit and furniture's moved
Eat a slug, take some weight off, I live this for real
I do this for the dead, rest in peace I'm holdin' you near
Makin' up time, 12 years we on tour we blow your back off
Support cats that jack the car seats and tear ya scalp off
Soldiers of merits, inherited from way back
Cyanide dipped bullets, so I should follow my stats
We too futuristic, thugs to robots, experiments
Four point restraint and my hyper cube on medicines
Pain veterans, crippling souls
It's gettin' bigger now the information runnin' the globe
It's just my mechanics, either with a gat or Xanax
Widespread panic until the sabbath

[Hook: Ill Bill]
