[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
As I dive into the center of the sun
Solar system, supernova, kingdom come, victims run
I stand here energized like hamas (?)
My posse terrorize whole villages
After warfare see decapitated heads as holy images
My religion is, hip-hop, staying alive with the slingshot
Sands of Palestine battle rhymes scatter sands of time
Man declines as I rise divine like the star shine
I stay in line, like the constellations in the sky
Out the mind, my astral plane travelled thoughts unravel
Like ancient carpets beneath the feet of pharaohs
Arrows pierce the narrow-minded
These devils trying to keep our fam divided
But we still stick together while these other cats are blinded
By the trick knowledge, yeah we be saying stop the violence
But if it get to deep then murk the president's designs
Got the secret service walking up and down the street mad nervous
Fed suckers surveillance tape for what I say from out the circuits
Y'all don't speak the truth, see that sniper standing on the roof?
He's receiving messages through radio waves in his tooth
(Unidentifiable Hebrew) that's all I need to say to kill this devil
Check the scary facts of where we at, it's on the illest level

[Hook]
Check the scary facts of the where we at (where we at)
Check the scary facts of the where we at (where we at)
Check the scary facts of the where we at (where we at)
Check the scary facts of the where we at  "WAKE UP!"
(2x)

[Verse 2: Goretex]
Ashem's the man of war interpret the verse what you expect?
Take a look around where men in black suits strapping with Tecs
I stand infinite like the old earth through death and birth
The devil washed our brain to kill over turf and net worth
Staying resourceful like literature reprinted, live it
Military to blow off your head like race gimmicks
Wipe that stupid grimace, we'll be dominating when earth finish
Knowledge is danger peep moving targets like Roy Innis
It keeps me wise of the climate of Israel
Patching Ford vans just like in goon flicks get out some fish tails
Walkie talkies checking backgrounds and signing ledgers
Paparazzi steez watching my seeds for tight measures
It be the same people cocaine kings flipping on us
Ain't got no airplanes but plenty of gats that we can bust
Ain't nothing rule but money, except holy forces above me
Disappear gear packed with the fam and flee the country

Hook (2x)
