[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
And so another adventure begins
Ski slopes, skis, automatic weapons
Downhill shootout with Bill, they out for vengeance
Those two brothers
The same two motherfuckers I mentioned In Swordfish
Yeah, Isaac and Ish
Ishmael is shit backwards and Isaac's a bitch
I'mma kill 'em both and still be left with five in the clip
These people invented and injected they mind with a chip
They shot and missed almost skiing off the side of the cliff
You know I shot back, Isaac was hit
A bullet ricochet off of his hip
Hit his brother Ish in the lip
An avalanche final finished they trip
Afterwards I had a ski buddy sucking me off up in the lift
Fucking me off up in the whip, dusting the dips
See me arriving by the hollow tunnel puffing a spliff
Put a hollow tip shell in my shit
Mind full of evil thoughts and my enemy's bitch

[Chorus: ILL Bill]
I murdered the beast with the six-fingered hand Head of a goat, seven horns
Seven red bloodshot eyeballs that glow
Whatta y'all know?
You can practically taste the brain matter
It splatters cameras: The Final Scene

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
I laugh and spit in the face of death, load 'em with lead
Go to the sunset on a black horse, holding his head
Destroyed an army closing in, it reminded me of that time in Brazil
When my government assigned me with a license to kill
Fresh out of CIA torture school
Taught me the most effective ways
To make prisoner of war talk to you
From Europe to South America, bloodbaths, kidnappings
Sounds hysterical, orgies in a mansion
Where the Cult Leader drained warheads
For antidotes to viruses
Corporate alliances, we buying shit
Finance security, first-world terrorism
Combined it with religion
It's proven the best business
Ask Osama, ask Bush, ask anybody
Give me a Ferrari and box full of money
A double agent with a hunger for paper
Now run they payment with my gun in they faces

[Chorus: ILL Bill]
