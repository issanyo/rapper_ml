[Hook x2: Sabac, Ill Bill & Goretex]
We all eat, we all shit, we all breathe
We all fuck, we all love, we all need
We all pray, we all hope, we all dream
We all live, we all die, we all bleed

[Verse 1: Sabac]
I write 12 bars and excite the mind of 12 gods
Hell's hard, you living it, existence is our differences
Non Phixion is like ministers, walk the Earth till it finishes
[?] we gotta fight the justice
Our thoughts are on some freedom by the thug shit
You loving, know your enemy, pull your gat and bust it
Trust it, I'm type minded aside the blinded
Remind it of time when we was young and toy guns was fun
Things then changed, the game is real life
Mother's cry "My baby died last night!" living gust and glass pipes
Poverty, modestly it's hard to be peaceful
When they got you trapped and won't release you to live true equality
I rhyme disturbed and angry only to offer oportunity
Regards of the disses I got love for my community
Break immunity, drug sales over [?] jails
If you can't then I'll express how it feel

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Ayo I plan to be a billionaire, God forgive me for my evil
For doing really fucked up things to good people
I rob the rich man, trying make the world equal
[?] that hurt people
The dirt we do guarantee that I'm going to hell
Going to war, going to jail, going to die
Bust the slug in the air, swallow my own blood, sweat and tears
?Spirit wishing I bust it first? but I fail, fuck that
I'm a survivalist [?] to fire full clips
In the matter of seconds, automatic weapons
Splatter banana in other direction, we wild out
Savages go against the righteous
It's like the AIDS virus kill you but there ain't no cure
It's like putting out an album but there ain't no tour
It's like fiend up for some pussy but there ain't no whore
It's like you're hungry for food but there ain't no more
It's like you fucking with me, It's like going to war
Throw you off the top of this building you going to fall
It's like walking through the morgue just holding my balls
Everything is everything and the same goes for all of ya'll

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Goretex]
I ride [?] of the lightning
Blast with the hands I fight with
The same [?]
I know my crib's bugged equipped with pipe bombs and drugs implanted
My gun's jamming, how the fuck you scheme about love
Until my son's standing grown man
I'll show his [?]
We build pyramids, Aztecs, militant thugs
Perform my ritual efficient you can tell by the drums
[?]
Computer faggots typing their truth
My model spits rounds aside the moshpits
Pissing razors like we all lifers
Trifle like pork with night sticks
But I got something better after you clip in your blue sweater
Who's better? Demonstrators aim at the door
Assassinated by the third joint I capture you all
Your shit is manufactured, you couldn't finish the war
