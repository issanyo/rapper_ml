(Verse #1: Life MC Verse)
I originate what others simulate, my words obliterate a track
My killer raps are addictive like I was spitting crack
Launch a lyricist attack on the system with facts
Tell a devil that I'm a rebel, I'm officially a back
Consistent with wisdom, precision rise a syllable pack
I paint visual pictures with militant scriptures of rap
Born in the war zone like kids in Iraq or children in Palestine
My soldiers mentality keeps me marching through these manic times
I keep speaking excellent testaments to the tenements residence
Every verse has a rebellion sentiment
Like aliens minds I possess incredible intelligence
And vision like Kim Peeks without the autism
This world that the we live in's a prison, religious divisions
The government's an evil cult trying to control your position
I'm exposing the mission, Life I've come to lay them to rest
'Cus I'm the focal grim reaper, arch angel of death!

(ILL BILL)
This is ILL BILL, cult leader Megatron
I transformed into a Predacon, Uncle Howie on methodon
Brooklyn to the core, system of a down, pistols in your mouth
Your mission isn't now, this is something else
This is how we dreamt about
Risking our freedom while flippin' out
Biscuits in the realm, bitches hit the ground, sins'll get devoured
Spinning in out of consciousness
Riddled without about a thousand clips
We willingly criminally found around and make him maniacally sick
Physically deduct, divide and flip
Four horrific sounds cancel you quiet as kept
Dumping your tire, tuck in your lungs, occupying your breath
On your knees in front of me, begging and crying for death
Demonically possesssed, economically depressed
Obsessed with sodomy and death
My commodity's [a vest?]
Yeah, we launch flames and rob planes
You don't understand yet?
Lucifer's the angel that god pays homie

(Chester P)
Be careful with the beef word
I'll rip off every nail on every finger thumb and toe you got and bang 'em where your teeth were
[Lung?] told the shepherd there's a leopard in his sheep herd
Pepper up the street curb, there's herbs in a deep verse
Lots of women flocking like sea birds
Never loving me, all they wanna see's the way that Chester P works
Run 'em into reverse, back into their childhood
Further to the womb and all the way until their rebirth
Happy in the streets and for the police I've got three words
"Suck mine"'s the first two, glad I never see bird
Too raggedy to be [?], barbiturates and baubles
And a snorkel in a [?], and see who goes to sleep first
Swear I'm into freak words, trapped in the caverns of time
Smash beats like plates in a Greek church
Stagger through the streets for a refurb'
My pages are sweet virgins faith
Yeah my sheets lay in feet first

(Life MC Verse #2)
So AHEAD OF THE GAME I'm feeling like nothing can harm me
Nothing can't stop me, Life I'm as stubborn as Robert Mugabe
I run the road like a Maserati, jack a Ferrari
Launch you with lyricism's, causes waves like a massive tsunami
Call me Malcolm-Ghandi with a dash of the Marleys
King like Martin Luther I'm a maneuver African armies
I'm as hot as safaris in the summer in Zimbabwe
No one could get next to me if they did they'd be dead in harm's way
You hear the flows are ultra, Ill Bill La Coka Nostra
Chester P the cosmic gypsy, Life I'm Jehova's soldier
Put you in a vocal coma, spit at you and super soak ya
Lyrically we rope and dope ya, explode like a supernova
Spiritually we run the culture
Mentally we untouchable, indestructible, phenomenal music composers
The sixteen megabar repertoire's like a seminar
On hip hop, how to spit hot, get props, and flow like reservoirs
