[Verse 1: Solicit]
The Bible says the first shall be last, and the last first
Well I'm at the back of the line till I'm inline in a black hearse
It's coming fast and the facts hurt, so let this verse act as my last words
There's no going back this time, I'm playing for keeps
I can feel my number coming, I've been praying for weeks
Every nation is praising the beast, and what they say in a speech ain't gonna sway me or change my beliefs
My whole life I’ve been hearing this
I was raised as a kid to fear GOD and I cherish the experience
But no matter what I say they’re not hearing me clear and it’s funny, I’m just labeled a conspiracy theorist
I’ve been seeing it for years and it’s not right
My thoughts might be what it takes to save a lost life
But when my time comes and I’m under the spotlight, I’m gone
But I’m never looking back like Lot’s wife

[Hook: ILL BILL]
I bring the light like Yeshua, the truth like William Cooper
Master Architects amongst the reptilian shooters
Amongst the brazen serpents and talking simian troopers
Drugs and Satan worship, torturing millions of humans
Above the pain, righteous man stand above influence
And nothing’s changed, except this time we ain’t trusting Judas
Their blood will rain from a dark sky, flood the sewers
Our guns will blaze, their sorcery will never consume us

[Verse 2: Travisty One]
We’re truly on some live, love, and light versus evil shit
And Google’s watching close, we’re kind of crazy for releasing this
Even if you’re thinking we ain’t sinking into tyranny, it’s clear to me
We’re just trying to see how many ears we’ll reach
You think I’ve gone cuckoo, then look up Gulf of Tonkin
Read Behold a Pale Horse, and the Northwoods document
From what I’ve seen so far, I’m not sure we can stop them yet
But that’s not the point, you gotta wake up, there’s lots ahead
At this point, GOD and each other is all we have
It’s a matter of time before the next false flag
Which they’re gonna use to further abuse our rights
They plan to turn us commie first, then turn off our lights
They murder our Christ in schools like we like the abuse
Then euthanize the suicidal youth, or recruit them into fighting troops
Far-fetched? What do you expect from conspiracy theorists
Just pray we’re around long enough to see that you hear it

[Hook]
