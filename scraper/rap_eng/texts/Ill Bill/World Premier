[Primo Scratching]:
"This a world premier"
"Ill Bill"
"Well then you just sit back and listen because I have a story for you."

[Verse One]:
It was a commercial on the DNA & Hank Love show
If you was there you know about the Little Rascal Studio
In Jamaica Queens, hot to death, dude was a clown
But back then it was prolly the cheapest studio in town
I went from watchin' Video Music Box with Ralph McDaniels
To rockin' 30,000 people surrounded by cameras
First rhyme in '82, first band in '87
First time we played as crew I doubt it was very impressive
But we kept on practicin' and we got better with time
Practice makes everything perfect, I'm in my veteran prime
And it's bigger than hip hop or being clever with rhymes
Cause I actually feed my seed with these endeavors of mine
And it's taken me around the world several times, it's crazy
It’s crazy what hard work & being focused can achieve, it’s amazing
My uncle's favorite group was Gang Starr, I wish he was here
Rest in peace to Howie and Guru, but salute to Premier
This is The Grimy Awards
When it's time to record
I attack the beat breaks like a viking with his sword
So throw your motherfuckin' hands up in the air
Like you don't care and make some noise for DJ Premier

[Hook]:
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
"It's Ill Bill"
"Is a world premier"
"World"
"Premier"
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
"It's Ill Bill"
"Is a world premier"
"World"
"Premier"

[Verse Two]:
I remember dreamin' about workin' with Extra P and Pete Rock
Put my mind to it and now they blessin' me with heat rocks
Same thing with Muggs, same thing with Primo and The Beatnuts
My dream team injected in your bloodstream you bleed drugs
Done four with Preme but this one's gots to be my favorite
Been a fan before Mass Appeal or Daily Operation
Since before they dropped Just To Get A Rep
I've been a fan of Gang Starr ever since Words I Manifest
And what's my favorite Primo joint of all time?
It's either Kick In The Door or New York State Of Mind
Or Ten Crack Commandments or Take It Personal
Too many bangers to choose from, he's too versatile
The Future Is Now joint, Rock Stars, unforgettable
The way he flipped Above The Clouds on the hook was incredible
Society Is Brainwashed, Mind Ya Business
This is a World Premier, and I designed the lyrics
This is The Grimy Awards
When it's time to record
I attack the beat breaks like a viking with his sword
So throw your motherfuckin' hands up in the air
Like you ain't care and make some noise for DJ Premier

[Hook]:
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
"It's Ill Bill"
"Is a world premier"
"World"
"Premier"
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
"It's Ill Bill"
"Is a world premier"
"World"
"Premier"
