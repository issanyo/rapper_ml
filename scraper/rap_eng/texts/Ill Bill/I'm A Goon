[Verse 1]
I hold my pistol like the bible
Turn the page to a verse of vengeance
Volcanoes of violence erupt in the words of each sentence
Here's a toast to the death of my enemies
My energy similar to the devil's chi
My treachery stretch for centuries
Menacing venomously
Make you hemmorage tremendously
My five senses suspended in weed and Hennessy
You bleed endlessly
My greed gets me everything, pussy, cars, anything
The means to fulfill any dream
I'm a fiend for the better things
La Coka Nostra, my team be veterans
Uncle Howie get the cream, who's better bitch?
Forever rich, lock me up and throw away the key, I'll still never snitch
I'm a goon

[Hook]
(Wild style goons in the room)
I'm a goon with a golden six-shooter and a mullet
I'm a goon
We the ones that they write movies about
(Uncle Howie goons take over)

[Verse 2]
I make the mosh pit spin like the Anthrax "Indians" video
Here we go a cross between Slipknot and Willie Bobo
So dope I cause relapses and overdoses
Explosive like stone tablets in the hands of Moses
The most focused on global implosion
Bill burn the truth into your eyes leaving both of them smoking
Smile for the barrel, swallow the magnum
Laughing in your face while the back of your head is vomiting fragments
You can't kill Bill, that was a movie, you can't move me
Withstand the maximum impact of Uzis or AK-47s
I'm already dead, it's ILL BILL the 2011 Melle Mel
Motherfucker what's really real? Really ill?
Run up on you, hit you with israeli steel yo we really will
Through windshields, windpipes and car seats
You die on the belt parkway next to Canarsie

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a goon in a world of atheists and religious fanatics
Pimps, whores, drug dealers, drug addicts
Rock stars, rappers, actors and other characters
Starfuckers and cocksuckers and million dollar savages
Negotiate with blowtorches to faces
Vacation, the golden nugget, made a fortune in Vegas
I'm the greatest, perfect methods of execution painless, popped in the ear of the stainless
Leave even geniuses brainless
Leave the general population shocked and horrified
Fucking with me you might as well have been born to die
My values are loyalty, truth, respect, and honor
My family's royalty, my life is an endless drama
My art is death and I'm about to paint masterpieces
Catastrophes, shattered dreams, amputees
Forgiveness is between you and god I just arrange the meeting
I just arrange the firing squad, arrange the bleeding, I'm a goon

[Hook]
