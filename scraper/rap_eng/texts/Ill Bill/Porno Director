[Intro]
I will need two forms of IV for purposes to verify your age
Make sure you sign that model release, because without that I'm not gonna be able to use your image
Of you sucking my cock
Check it out

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Ill Bill, the rap Jules Jordan, call me the hip-hop Joey Silvera
Represent the bitches bang me, then let them blow me forever
The balls deep, but we all creeps, the pistol's popped
Looking for beautiful girls like Christoph Clark
I need an Evil Angel in my life, [?] property
More goons with guns that go to war properly
The projects, the gutter, I grew up in poverty
I'm rich now, Uncle Howie Records is a monopoly
Your monstrosity roll with the dream associates
My team is the real deal, your team is a bunch of dicks
We top of the pie, rock it like [?]
Lockin' it down, droppin' it live and then rock it with pride
I been around the world, partied with all types of girls
From police woman and stripper with thousand pearls
A whole boat rode the hoes that swallowed my pole
But only a Puerto can throw me out of control

[Chorus x2: Ill Bill, Sabac & Goretex]
Pussy and hard drugs, sawed-off shotguns, we Godâ€™s thugs
Get my cock sucked by rock groupies and pop sluts
Weird chicks, with big titties and pierced clits
Exotic dancers in love with us, the fuck you think?

[Verse 2: Goretex]
Goretex the young wizard, my life is like a porn set
Drug blizzards, runaway bitches slump dead on my door step
Sugar momma's got a crush on Gore
Fisting their ass, twisting nipples, sucking my balls
Tappin' the bush, medium rare was mush
She ain't happy unless she got pills and the arm in a tush
Sparking the kush, leavin' off the strippers like it's welfare
Hip-hop the ligaments, I'm killin' shit (we in the mix)
Haters obsessed, I'll be swervin' the Benz
My chick's ass is so fucking fat, be hurting her legs
Twenty eight cadavers, but I ain't heard from the feds
Uncle Howie opium dead, we be reppin' on death
Stay bakin', you american faggot like Clay Aiken
Come back and you be dancin' the raves like Ave's patients
Belly up, we thuggin' and heavy, my goons ready
Your skull's a deli, my guns turn your head to confetti

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Sabac]
I'm obscene
Enter your nightmares, challenge your dreams
Non-Phixion, we the most balanced team
My themes and thoughts so deep, man, it hurt when I spit
Sabacolypse, conscious lyricist perverted and sick
Converted the wig of a nationalist
I love them chicks on tour who like flashin' their tits
A passionate bitch who take it in the ass or what attached to wrist
Them fast with the fist, a massacres of [?] and kids
Blast at the pigs (blaow!) cause of what they do to the people
I get my dick sucked while I read the Rulers of Evil
I flew with the eagles, swam with the sharks
Damage your heart, I break you down, built you up as I plan for the mosh
Stay armed with fourty women that are psyched about porn
Phone the biggest fucking orgy on the White House lawn
Force the twins to join in, have the both them to blow me
[?]

[Chorus x2]
