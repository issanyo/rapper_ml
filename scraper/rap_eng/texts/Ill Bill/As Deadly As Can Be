[Intro]
As deadly as can be~

[Verse 1: Necro]
The Abaddon Dapper Don
Performing surgery on you like Trapper John
While Sabbath is on, into coffin burglary
Anaconda, murder marathon, cadaverous like Harrison, sacrifice a rabbit, blasphemous stone tablets, the beyond
Flow like the Acheron, packin' the kronze under my leather jacket like Fonz
My click surrounds you like brackets, you vagabond, jackass
I got a dagger on me to stab you faggots
My swagger is calm, pull the trigger, holdin' Megatron in my palm
Spit flames like a chimera, split ya brain like Barrera
Guerilla warfare like Guevara, kill like malaria
Triple six like the river Styx, like River Phoenix's excess which lead to his death from coke and heroin mixed
The chronicles of hell, robotic cripples, demonic nipples, on Baphomet's chest like applique, buck like Corrato with pistols
Disgusting gluttony
Try the Susan Atkin's weight reduction plan, liposuction with rusty cutlery

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Mentally disturbed, centuries of hurt
Ecstasies and percs, destinies of dirt, festering and burnt
Ill Canabill, my recipe's preferred, the gourmet, filet and saute
Ordained by raw pain, I curse the lord's name
Psychopathica sexualis, all day
Ejaculate to serial killer memorabilia and necrophilia
Sex predator
My head's infested with meth fetish, the death metaller
Tit chop breast editor, the piss mop sex peddler
Bestiality spike dog collar mamas eat shit and drink vomit
Type of whores to wallow in it, they don't find a fist foreign
Control motivated, before hostel hit the big screens
A torturer murderer running loose on a killing spree
This is spinal tap, no anesthesia
My feelings are a freezer, mysterious like the pyramids of Giza
Massacre fantastica
Your murder scene is where I'm broadcasting from
While blood bubbles stutter from your splattered cunt
