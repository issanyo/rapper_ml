[Verse 1: Mr Hyde]

For the sake of the gore so we awake in the morgue
I’m fucking breaking your jaws up, all you haters get torn
Blood caked on the floor, get all your trachea clawed up
The slaughter, it shows up your bones get sawed up
Split half a clip, out the biscuit with quickness
The bitches that diss this’ll witness the sickness
Malicious, like witches concoctions or potions
I’m vicious, my hit so get dropped in the ocean
Pop with the motion, the clocks are exploding
You’re rocking the nose with the ox that I’m holding
You fold under pressure, the mould will caress you
Infect ya, I bet ya corrosion will get ya
Fester with death, your cult status drained
I’ll dispatch your batch in short spats of pain
Claimed souls that stained hold the keys to destruction
The same old brain bone bleeding it’s disgusting

[Verse 2: Q-Unique]

Still I fill you full of lead
Got the hollow tips drilling till your blood is spilling red
Holler at the villain with the ? for killing feds
I’m swallowing the pill, filling visions in my head, enemies are still and dead
Mister murder, I’ll make a jump suit out of your flesh
A powerful Rottweiler will devour the rest
You pray for world peace, I pray for world chaos
I work to alerting the beast out of a séance
Street demon will leave you in the streets bleeding
My sweet semen cover your bitches teeth gleaming
Dumb undercover trying to score bird
Let’s save the earth and smoke weed, but I’ll go to third
Losers stuck in time, find a god for a crime to earn a buck and I lose my fucking mind
Robbed him twice cause he said he had more
Let’s infiltrate the system with Freddy Madball

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]

Satanic verses, black masses in Catholic churches
Casting curses, you bleed when we scratch the surface
The greed of a master and his servant, assassin and a serpent
Numbers are scratched from the surface of a ratchet
While cash is preferable to blasting
Leave you with a fucking hole in your face like what happened?
Why you had to die like that?
Took a shit on yourself while you took your last breath
Shoulda had respect, shoulda, coulda, woulda
Hit your head with hollow tip casings
Chopper of hatred, topple the matrix
Chop at the basis, virus that get trife but sacred
Like thirty years later thinking your life was wasted
The loneliest death is suicide
A gallery of paintings covered with the blood of truth denied
Streets guaranteed to turn red when youth collide
Yeah, I even tell the truth when I lie and this is why
