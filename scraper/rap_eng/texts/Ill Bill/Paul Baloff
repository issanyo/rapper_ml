Disastrous appetite
The last massacre fantastica ambassador
My castle’s like Vlad Dracula’s
Bath in blood, blast the snub
Plastic gloves, laugh at love
My heart is pitch black
Like a panther cub or a cancer lung
Call me acid tongue
Hit hard like Black Sabbath drums
Like an assassin does
Big silencers and massive guns
Cooked in the mind, the first to blast and the last to run
Look in my eyes, you'd think that Manson had a bastard son
Cast aside after dancing out a rancid cunt
Tabs and lines got me ranting, and trashed inside a trance on drugs
I shovel snow up to my dome until my hands are numb
Bundles of dope I know my uncle would be amped to touch
A smorgasbord of enormous whores and trashy sluts
Nasty ass & jugs happily jack me till I’m blasting cum
And stay swerving into murder and perversion
Urgent when we're inserting lysergics in the virgin
Cadaveric maverick savages ravage the average
Evangelist family to famished cannibal sandwiches
Edible funerals, turn terrible to beautiful
Sever dudes for food, several medical tools are suitable
Trouble times - some will live, some will die
Chewed out in a tomb, found mummified
Shoot-outs in the summertime
Bubble crime, devil might drive-by
Genocide cenobite,
Rebels strike hard like a metal pipe
Bark like a kennel fight
Sharp like a venom bite
Dark like an ocean filled with sharks in the dead of night
Levitate and write, everything God said to Christ
Hell Awaits like Kerry King rocking metal spikes
Like Paul Baloff at studio 54 live
"Ultimate Revenge Tour" VHS, all time greatest
Spray death here - shoot the llama from the elbow
Like James Hetfield produced the Piranha demo
