[Hook]
My uncle shoots heroin, my father used to do cocaine
My moms smoked weed with her friends the day I turned eight
Started smoking age twelve, sold it at fourteen
Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
Conscious rap is bullshit, gangster rap is a fraud
This is real rap, bang your fucking head through the wall
This is drug music, stuck with a syringe in your arm
I'm the truth like the name of the song
Yo my uncle shoots heroin

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Bathroom floor, found a syringe
Back from the Hiero Tour, Howie went out on a binge
The snake bitch I was fucking even took him to cop
A month later he was on the floor looking for rock
Missed a flight to Czech Republic, walked in the rest
Found him lying in his own puke talking to death
Cocaine poisoning, he shot the heroin since fourteen
February 2003, he was clean
I helped him out, he kicked crack, dope, and meth
Hosted shows, free clothes, bubble baths, autographs
Told me he wanted to make a Howie action figure
Before his latest relapse I'm glad I captured pictures
I love Howie, homie used to change my diapers
To save him I'd have jumped in front of spray from snipers
But this is just something that he's gotta do on his own
I try to get through to him with this song yo
My uncle shoots heroin
He used to live in my crib, sleep on my couch smoking Newport 100's
Gave me comic books, bought me my first bass guitar
Learned from my grandma how to tell you the future with cards
Watch the sci-fi channel high off of methadone
More addictive than anything injected in the arm
D.T.'s five in the morning waking my moms
Got a search warrant but Howie Tenenbaum is gone
Roaming the streets, he was a superhero to me
When I was five I used to pick the seeds out of his weed
Nodding out, burning cigarette holes in his sheets
Wake up and eat a box of cereal then go back to sleep
He was a crackhead too, he might still be
A walking relapse, that motherfucker's still on the street
You tell him right he goes left
Show him right he does wrong
I hope I get through to him with this song yo
