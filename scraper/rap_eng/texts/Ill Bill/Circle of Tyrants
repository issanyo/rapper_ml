[Verse 1: Necro]
I'm like a dead corpse crawling out the dirt, on some zombie shit
Aiming for your neck to bite the flesh where the veins connect
My brains incorrect, traumatize you in a sec
My rap are like crack in a deck, Satanic intellect
Slaughters you, I got more for you
Gore for you, your flesh is sort of blue
You'll be begging someone to pull me off of you
When I'm stabbing you, I offered you a chance to leave
You'll only understand when you bleed, there's no talking to you
Just shoving a fork in you, who the fuck you talking to?
Im pure death in a flesh, I'll arrange a coffin for you
My knife packing status, got you shook
A lot of crooks respect my rep, step, kid I advise you not to look
Turn your head, or you'll turn up dead
Put you to sleep inside a burning bed, learn from what I said
I'm mushing your peeps, and I'm squishing you deep
Beneath, where the deceased rest in peace

[Verse 2: Mr Hyde]
I.. injure you with ninja crews, Contemplate what sin to do
Negotiate with Satan, cause it's his decision too
Hold a sword like ghost dog, leaving blood and gross gore
So disgusting that your corpse is not allowed in most morgues
So jagged and decrepit kid, that the maggots rejected it
I dumped it in the sea and killed all life except for squid
Walk the wrong path, deviated by demons
While you faggot mother fuckers were created by semen
Lure you into my web, change your corduroys to red
Then look for you to find you in the mortuary dead
Fill my clip with the leather put the biscuit to the head
After I ripped you up to shreds I'll take a sip of what you bled
Don't ever try and hawk or rip cause I don't wanna talk
Ill play the kind of sport the way you catch a tommahawk
Open up your skull, fabrics falling to the ground
Take a toke and sniff a pull like your drawn to the sound

[Verse 3: Goretex]
Thugs cry blood, supported by the hemp and the guns
Y'all tempt me to flip, so morbid when I empty the clip
It's awful how we decorate your coffin, send me the clit
We celebrate when enemy blood shakes, now render me sick
Whatever ya fix, get fitted with a milli a chrome
Rap Vinnie Jones, I disattach, snatch from the bone
And ate the last witnesses, k-ed out on medicine
Health nut, crush up my wheat germ, chase it with heroin
Guerrilla biscuits, busting your windpipes into splinters
Another thing that causes pain is the frost in the winter
Circle of tyrants, rock an inverted cross iced-out
Blood from em, two in your face, get erased, lights out
Spikes out for dish rags, keep em on the hip like shit bags
You don't want it fag? Be left in the bubble, covered [?] the fam
State bent, like breathing rubber, so be advised
Lucifer's rising the invocation of my demon brother

[Verse 4: Ill Bill]
Splattered in blood, rather my thoughts paddles in drugs
Morbid visions of cadavers ravaged by maggots and bugs
Beetles crawling out of your eyes sockets
Puss pouring out of your mouth on top of dry vomit
Billions of body bags, blood drenched battle fields
Big butcher knives, you fucking faggits
Get your fucking face erased from your cabbage
Tangled and gored on top, half of you're body hanging off the door
Spasm and splash your organs across the floor
Its death.. the slug hit the bullet proof vest
I took from the policeman after I blew off his head
We knights of Satan serving Satan's Seders
God is an atheist, you fucking idiots, your bitches give brain to us
Save yourself, the altar of sacrifice
We criminally insane, escape form Bellevue
Sniffing up cocaine don't even try it
It's Ill Bill, the gourmet of violence
Donate my brain to science, vacation in insane asylums

[Verse 5: Captain Carnage]
Come on come all to my carnival of carnage
Where I'll.. slice and dice and peal off your shell like an orange
I'm too precise not to be nice
I know you like Christ you'll pay twice the price
I'll put brains on ice
For preparation prepare for the separation
Of your foundation so come get your found basted
In hot sauce I roasted like hot dogs on an open fire I'm a trig like Myer
But don't anile the entire picture, because I hang you like fixture so when you enter the mixture
Use extreme caution, because it only takes one portion
To perform an abortion with the steel that I force in
You feel lost when you get tossed in the bottomless gorge
The heroin horde got guns and swords swords swords swords
