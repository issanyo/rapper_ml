[Hook: Lawrence Arnell]
The sun keeps shining
People keep trying me I can't waste my time
The black four-five when shit get wild
You fuck around and lose your life
You thinking it's a game
Cause people know your name
You gon' find out the hard way
I ain't what you thought I was

[Verse 1: Slaine]
I got a brand new feeling still A Brand You Can Trust
The Skull and Guns with the cap and the bandanas you love
Point your pistol at your enemy you stand and you bust
(BANG BANG) on these foes - it's sucha animal rush
Got that old thing back it's like you can and you must
That monarchy-anarchy's waking me and standing me up
Walking me around I'm ranting with insanity much
Too much for my own good (so I abandon these drugs)
But I feel like I'm fighting for my life when I'm writing still
I was feeling like my skills were heightened when I'm biting pills
(BREATHING) Pacing 'round the lab crushing white and pills
I got so much venom - FUCK LIFE if I might get killed
Then I might get killed - let me write this will
My head was fucked now I'm sober and it's like that still
The same lunatic, giant gun the defiant son
I thought I told you I AIN'T DONE

[Hook: Lawrence Arnell]

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
You heard Slaine sober, I'm a cocaine boulder
Smoke dust with the Angel of Death, my brain's vulgar
But my heart's blacker than Bad Brains, see these last days
I'm in a bad place, homie, I need a damn change
A reignition, a new mission, a campaign
Kill 'em with success and bury them with a glad face
Meet 'em with a smile, tell 'em what you really think
Then beat 'em with a brick, then feed 'em to the pigs
Throw 'em to the roaches feed 'em to the spiders and snakes
Lies and fakes personify violence and hate
But I'm smarter now, I realize that drama is lame
And I own my mistakes, though my karma is pain
And that’s just the way of the world but what part of the game
Said I gotta stay the same way I was yesterday
I’m trying real hard to be the shepherd
But don’t push me up against the wall
That would be a motherfucking death wish

[Hook: Lawrence Arnell]
