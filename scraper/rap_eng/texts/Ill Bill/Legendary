[Verse 1: Slaine]
I was walking with my Walkman on
Boppin' with no vodka spillin'
Escape in a maze, in a haze, it was an awesome feelin'
[?] chameleons
Cut out patches taped to cross of walls and ceilings
The trolley car rumbled by my window
I'm rocking molly mile to calm me down before I ever popped a benzo
I might be young, but the world I seen is cold
It is this night I heard the sirens, someone stabbed one of the older kids below the ribs and let him die
I seen his mother and his brethren cry with vengeant eyes lookin up to heaven skies
That's when I learned about time and how it never lies and never stops for nobody, and I was on the seven mind
Up on eight and now I'm fine, that was all the crook
To carry thing I felt and saw, I wrote it in a book
My mother found my shoe box and knew I had a oddest heart
Life was [?] I haven't hit the hottest spot

[Chorus: Jared Evan]
I remember in the days when things were new
I just wanted to
Be legendary, ooh
Everything that's so cold is announced through
That's what you do
To be legendary, ooh yeah

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Yo, yo
I was walking with my Walkman on
Brooklyn seem ?a little lebanon?
Straight bullets, third world the bad sty
East New York creeps with hawks swift for yours before the reaper draws
Take 10 paces, pull out, and let the sweeper roar
Sweet like candy til' an ambulances hand thee
But minute laughing and happy til' they massacre your family
It was all good a week ago, peep it slow
Iron sights 20-20 and killers like money-money
I rather cherish then perish, rhyme terrorist
Climb Everest
My endeavours give me wings, ride pegasus
Gimme purpose
Light a fire in a furnace
I provide a service, watch closer, try to learn this from the projects professor
I leave a legendary catalogue but how some I will live forever
Guess I'm fucked, only thing I love is drugs and magnums
And momma told never to take what I love for granted

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah
I was walking with my Walkman on
Listenin' to Etta James
?Nothing change if nothing change? unless you have a better range
Broken glass everywhere from the broken homes
Every Philly street is like a boulevard of broken bones
The only white bulb and still they provide love for me
I come from a place where the devil reside comfortably
A lot of these motherfuckers out there is sons to me
Denyin' I'm the father and they stoll to take a blood from me
Maybe I'm a narcissist, maybe I'm an arsonist
I just wish that there was more David Foster Wallaces
I would read dictionaries and study [?]
Look for the proper definition of what an artist is
Literary chauvinist literal to every logicist
I only followed rappers I thought was bringing apocalypse
I never ever referred to myself as legendary
My son good, so everything else is just secondary

[Chorus]
