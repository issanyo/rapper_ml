We rally
Round the I
Around the I
And we never wonder
And we never wonder why
Nor will we say goodbye
That's why we rally round the I
Round the I

Life's a battle of the network stars
It's unraveled & mentally scarred
I gambled on my destiny's cards
Acapulco gold, jewels and coal
Fools behold, truth unfolds
View the road ahead of me, holmes
I've steadily grown
My heavenly soul control the deadliest chrome
But the life of a child is what God has blessed me to mold
This is something I put before everything, every thought
Every bit of energy is focused on her every need
I don't give a fuck how gangster you think you are
When you witness the birth of your first child it hits hard
Speaking for myself I'm still speechless
But I owe it to her to put this into words
In case I'm not here when she peeps this
God forbid, I plan to be here 'til a hundred and five
'Til my great grandchildren are alive
'Til they listen to this rhyme and wonder why
We rally round the eye
It's so we never say goodbye
Baby girl, it's for you, Riya

[Hook 2: HR]
I want you to love me
And never, ever worry
It doesn't matter anymore
No more
It's time for us to rally round the I
Let's rally round the I
Rally round the I
Rally round the I
Rally round the I

We named you after my mother's mother
She raised me, now we raise you
When I look at you, praise due
Thank God for this beautiful life
Now everything makes sense, thank God for my beautiful wife
In Hindu, Riya's a singer, a beautiful voice
We could've stopped right there, what a beautiful choice
In Hebrew it means "joy", in Arabic it means "hope"
In Latin it means "queen", in Yiddish it means "rose"
To me it means kick down doors with four-fours
If grandma was still here she'd have given me the chrome
I don't grind for me no more, I grind for her
I don't live for me no more, I'd die for her
Human Rights, we bringing the truth to the light
Bring the youth to the fight while we shoot through the night
This is dedicated to my wife and my baby girl
Riya Mae Braunstein, I give you my whole world
I love you
