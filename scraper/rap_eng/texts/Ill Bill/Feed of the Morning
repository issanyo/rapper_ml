[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Bandanas and barrels
Gladiators, cowboys with Rugers
Paranoid shooters
Caucasoid mutants with Uzis
Die in action with the eye-patch and eyeglass, then my assassins rhyme ratchet  without sirens and the badges ?)
Read the signs of a savage
Aligned to the tragic
Put cyanide in your sandwich
Cause a riot on your campus
Fist of fury when the crystal blurry, catch a pistol, hurry
Fuck quantum physics and theory we minds is fucking for-really
Dust the ganja and philly’s with Russian mafia villains
(? Right into to the Kremlin ?)
Coke'll take you right into the emblem
We the righteous to rebel, yet when we strike it then we tell them
Drop your swords or we’ll be forced to leave you lifeless and dismembered
Satanic messages spoken loudly with intros
Automatic weapons is pokin’ out of my tinted windows
Jack Daniels with some coke and some lime
My rituals are older than time, it’s spoken in rhyme

[Hook: Jise One] (x2)
Who’s hungry let’s eat
Break bread pass it down chew the food then breath
And that’s the feed of the morning (who’s thirsty)
And that’s the feed of the morning

[Verse 2: Jise One]
Talk shit, breathe, and live with conviction
Lancer, dissident, reminiscing at the friction between love and hate
The gate oppression
The infestation of injustice
The blind accustoms between religion and state
The poisonous cake that we possess with the desire to overindulge
She’s fine, the mirror's sneaky, consults the ass and titties should be more bulge
The frivolous search for the fountain of youth
Constrain the beat of a pulse to a pulp
Pockets choke dream's croak
The question of life’s purpose decided by desire
They call it peace of mind
Distracted by greed
Envious deeds, self sympathy and foolish pride
We plead with God to survive
We're side by side ourselves
To coincide with our old lives
Ride the tide ‘til it concedes, concede in to all the demons inside

[Hook: Jise One] (x2)
