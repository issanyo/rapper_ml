Now I wanna get high
Some rollin and smokin
Poppin and drinkin
And stop for the thinking
And hop in this lincoln and lets roll
And I ain't talkin about the pills we pop so lets go
The block that I got
So hot, I call it off in a stow
Thats what we gotta hit him to digit, you know
And I let it get high cause it often expose
The real in a man what they stand-in for
Say im bout to overdose like Anna Nicole
Plus the devil already got one hand on my soul
Should I stand on my toes?
Cause im walkin on the tight road
Thin line between yours and mine when they not blow
And you can die slow...
Get smoked like hydro
Then I'ma bounce like hydros
And I know that it just ain't right
But as long as I can sleep at night!!

Ain't no comin back from that
You tryna do me wrong put my name in a song
Ain't no comin back from that
Im so goddamn high mind all up in the sky
Ain't no coming back from that
25 for the ale no parole no bail
Ain't no coming back from that
Two shots in the head - flatline and you dead
AINT NO COMIN BACK!!

I make yo blocks pop off
The streets locked off
When the heats cocked off
Goes a body to the morgue
Got the best kush money can afford
So if you think about jackin
We gotta send you home to the law
You can see us when we out on tour
With everybody flippin in the place
N*ggas can't keep our pace
And you don't wanna see the heater chilling by my waste
But if you gotta most likely it'll bleed your face
Take a chill pill for-real, we break ya will
Im the bullet in the gunshot by ill bill
Im assassin with the hustler skill
Off the hill when the crosshairs homie
One shot one kill
And it's a one way trip in your lesson
Start running jack
You like mason career - it's no comin back
It goes click-clack
This shit's on track
Learn how to act or we twist ya shit
BITCH!

Laa laa la-laa laa
Laa laa la-laa laa

Ain't no comin back from that
You tryna do me wrong put my name in a song
Ain't no comin back from that
Im so goddamn high mind all up in the sky
Ain't no coming back from that
25 for the ale no parole no bail
Ain't no coming back from that
Two shots in the head - flatline and you dead
AINT NO COMIN BACK!!

To the day before negotiations
Dont waste no breath no conversations
No price no lefts I lay and win game
2 - 2 - 3 rounds, kick your face in
Men, I should have seen it comin
Behind your eyes I can see your mind racing -
Heart sink to your weak stomach!
You not from it
Im sam bada summer
Im a franchise built from the gutter, thinking
Im a million dollar vocal with a grip
So why I'm in here fucking with this 20-dollar bitch
Ignorant bliss-a-bish like a black hole
I disappear with a dinosaur, get strong
So strong make the homies make housecalls
Answer or not - yo block gets knocked off
Chopped off, no time for apologies - words are done
Cause you can't take it back when they pull a n*gga gun!!

Ain't no comin back from that
You tryna do me wrong put my name in a song
Ain't no comin back from that
Im so goddamn high mind all up in the sky
Ain't no coming back from that
25 for the ale no parole no bail
Ain't no coming back from that
Two shots in the head - flatline and you dead
AINT NO COMIN BACK!!
