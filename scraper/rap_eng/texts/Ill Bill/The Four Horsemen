[Verse 1: Ill Bill]

I've been an outlaw and a gambler
Long as I can remember
Drink whiskey from a bottle and always carry a banger
Poker face, womanizer, bank robber, and legend
My name ring bells across the frontier when I'm mentioned
When I step foot in the saloon, I get a lot of attention
I reckon there's haters; you're threatened by the strength of our weapon
The speed of our bullets you wanna taste the heater, I pull it
I'm a goon with a golden six shooter and a mullet
Four dead, jump up on top the bar then shout
If anybody else want drama better, pop it off now
How many times this situation happened I can't remember
So I turned 21 and got drunk with the bartender
Gun slingers think they Clint Eastwood
I'm like Jesse James, ride up on a pony dump six in they face
Twistin' they frames like tumble weeds
Blister they brains then bounce to the whore house for more whiskey and things

[Verse 2: Goretex]

The Navajos and Mayans wrap their skin in tigers for battle
Feeding the cows; like Josey Wales, I'll hold it down with two barrels
Back to the tarots, prostitution rackets in Paris
Sippin' cactus, dippin' on stallions, my corduroys are blood splattered
Decapitated, my spurs carve like taxiderm'
Torched the mayor, jacked on his wife, and let his carriage burn
Numerous moonshine runs in Kentucky
Keep the powder up in the ten gallon in case I get lucky
Old medicine man on his porch staring at commons
Four horseman, we riding through your prairie like shamans
Close to the dream, shot up the voting machine, it's progress
Kidnapped the senator's daughter, penetrated with objects
Whiskey bottles and twist offs, killers no conscience
It’s either dead or in jail, it’s high noon for the convicts
The bloody sickle strapped to my chaps is conquest
It's a glory ride, this battle hymn, sun in the compass

[Hook: Necro]
The horsemen are drawing nearer
On a leather steed we ride
We've come to take your life
All through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

[Verse 3: Necro]

There's no law spittin' phlegm on the floor and clappin'
I'll test you; skin that smoke wagon, see what happens
I'm tired of your gas jerked that pistol and go to work
Throw down boy I'll bitch slap you till your lip blood squirts
My aiming is more than precise when I slay men
We both got gats, let's play for blood, just say WHEN
Let's settle this, so we're crystal clear
On whose the nicest and fastest ever; I'm the deadliest pistolier
There's no future for dumb fucks after my gun bucks
Smooth when I'm maneuvering my six shooter like nunchucks
Shooting clowns in they faces, then drinks on me
Piano man Stephen Foster, Camptown Races
I'm down to dump anywhere, I'm far from a punk
I got two guns; one for each one of you when I'm drunk
Watch out when the squad's out
Don't you ever try to man handle the caval'
We'll cut your fucking pimps heart out

[Verse 4: Mr Hyde]

O.K. Corral style shootouts at sundown
I'm taking ten paces, splatter faces with a round
Quick draw like Will Carver with the .44 revolver
Got a fist full of dollars once I started robbin' [?]
The tomb stone terrorist buckin' down my nemesis
Creeping in the crevices, wanted man ever since
Sixteen, blamed for the murder of a deputy
Robbed 30 banks and they're never close to catching me
Drawing fire first your destinies inside the dirt
Cause my trigger finger's faster than the hands of Wyatt Earp
I'll stumble in a bar, guns and bourbon in my clutches
Five card stud, catching straights and royal flushes
Wild bunch horseman the fugitive outlaw
With double barrel action son, I'll shoot at you southpaw
Young guns with tote style, always the most vile
Riding through your streets, turn your hood to a ghost town

[Hook: Necro]
