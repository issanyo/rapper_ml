[Verse 1]
Ayo, I seen it all
From what the truth should be, to what the truth is
As we evolve from what we used to be onto some new shit
Rewrite the blueprint, with true grit
Students of moving bricks and full clips
Or otherwise we just threw fists
Been breaking bad, ever since before I became a dad, or made in in rap
In truth, I still cater to that
Root for the villain getting paid in full
Spraying the gat on the roof of my building
Getting brain, taking it back
I was that projects professor
A white kid digesting Five Percenter lessons
I copped from the brother selling incense
Extensively, studied Rakim and all the emcees
Eventually discovered I spit rather intensely
Now here I am, speaking to everybody that be listening
The hardcore hiphop with heart, like nitroglycerin
The type of rap you feel in your cardiac
That grimy, illmatical boom bap - mathematical goon rap

[Hook]
Check one-two, one-two

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I rise and laugh at the lies, analyzing the science of things
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king
The path of the divine crash into gunfire and brimstone
Adapt to survive - the spilled blood dries when the wind blows
Look to the past, see your future staring back at you
Holdin' a gat, holdin' you back
And bearing ample fruit and opportunity
Get in where the fuck you fit in with unity
We stand tall - what the fuck could you do to the assault literary?
Slaughtercult military - Necronomicon Don
Occult visionary
Conspiracy host behold secret mystery scrolls
Seen black satanic lesbian titties explode
Fuck livin' on your knees, I'd rather die on my feet
Rise in the street, fistfights with riot police
These lines I wrote potent like lines of coke
A kaleidoscope of the violent prone
That's just me on the beat by Pete Rock n roll

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The excellence and inspiration of truth, is the pursuit
It's like an exercise for the mind
Like a nine when it shoots
Testify with lies implied beside a mountain of proof
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, many have died for the fruit
Organic and natural, harvested from off the vine
Of verified indisputable factual and actual
The only sure thing in life is death, shooters and bricks
Coca pure, sniff white, respect Lucifer's gift
Death is only the beginning, heads exploding and spinning
Like The Exorcist possession
Unholy and grinning
Tell 'em Welcome to hell, enter the ceremony of winning
Where I'm from sharks fly and the vultures are swimming
The truth is gang raped while the world watches it horrorified
Compulsively taped with flip cams then watch it tomorrow high
Shoot it like Columbine
Edit it and upload, then YouTube it online for derelicts and cutthroats
