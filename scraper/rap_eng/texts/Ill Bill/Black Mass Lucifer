[Verse: 1 Vinnie Paz]
Pasion Azteca while I stare at a model
This is cannibal holocaust with Ruggero Deodato
And the body getting buried over there in the grotto
It's the gate of the god pa right here in the novel
Where a fucking chopper at? I'm a see who really real
I'm a load this blicky and then aim for the achilles heel
Edinson Cavani pit the 9 in his back
And then my fam slam on you like the lion attack
The lion is back Pistolero be on his deen
And have your body hooked up to a breathing machine
I'm fleeing the scene with an infrared beam and its green
Because these Joseph D. Pistone's be to eager to sing
Seeking the kings, And I'm let it rain ock
Bullets rain on you like they motherfucking raindrops
Money long gone B, I spend it on my gun advance
The evolution pistol make his body do a the swammy dance

[Hook: Ill Bill]
Black mass Lucifer crucifixion
Hatchbacks used for drive-by shooter missions
I speak fluent in new pistols, a shoot addiction
Before my goons I walk barefoot through a blizzard
Black mass Lucifer crucifixion
Hatchbacks used for drive-by shooter missions
I speak fluent in new pistols, a shoot addiction
Before my goons I walk barefoot through a blizzard

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Penthouse? Twice as dope, Move like nuclear isotope
Shoot you from a mile away through the rifle scope
Assault ya through hell-fire for icy coles, Light ya dome
Sizzle in the snow, like a lightning bolt
I melt your fucking skull like a ice cream cone
Engineered to explode like a ISIS-drone
Hit you random like a rambo knife
Commando type, camo stripe
Supervillian strike like alpha flight
The evil in Knievel, fly like a desert eagle
Extra hebrew, enter the blood drenched cathedral
Fuck with me you face cobras
And flame throwers and space soldiers
Its over I'm taking hold to
Get your fucking face exploded
Walk with a murder swag
Ill Bill burner bang, heavy metal murder gang
So run away with the clever
Or you can die right now vacation forever

[Verse 3: Goretex]
Tuddy Vario we carry the jelly out in two caprice
I’m like Dr York in the mausoleum I’m two degrees
Iommi jacket with fringes witchcraft up the sleeve
Got goons like Buddy Hackett that will blast you and leave
Wigs like blue Cher a hundred mircrodots called Bill Steer
Some shotguns pellets are a doozy from ear to ear
Don’t make me pop your eyes out stupid for Charlie M
Medina Arafat boxcutter William Cutting they carve your gem
We don’t carve ears Garry him and your limbs first
Food Embassy up in the kitchen like Big Lurch
Extort the public when I move like a sick church
We sick first, step you getting hit with the clip first
A thousand round ACGs Vinnie superfreeze
This motherfucker turn your features into gouda cheese
Provolone grill big mouth closed coffin
Cadaver kids we let our vengeance out post-mortem
