[Hook]
*various scratching*
Spit real game
I'll blast on you as you pass on through
Catch you right where you stand
Come on

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Yo, yo, yo, leave you fubar
Quicker than eager shooters
Some bleeding tumors squeezing, screamin' UZI's
Some scheming losers, at Peter Luger's
Goons with AK's and Suvs, creeps with eagles and ubers
Shoot and cruise and blew super bulls
Pursuing you with Rugers
This is slasher flicks massacres
To cast a precious greedy reedy big titty
Sarcastic bitches with the flashy nipples
Ask Mephisto, walk upon the blasting pistols
Embrace the Satan like Metallica, move the band to Frisco
I spit murder like the ghost of Cliff Burton
[???] Intense like a pistol pop
Surrounded by savage clones and assassin drones
Laugh [?...] stay flammable like acetone
Made by Yakub, high in his laboratory
The crafted leopard suit beside his minatory
Sharper than Capricorn horns and [Matterwor] swords
G's overseas like a Hasselhoff song

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
Yo, where's a war when I was born for it
Rugers will turn your soul to ether
Smash your motherfucking bones in half like when you fold a pizza
Have to hold the heater, cause I blast when I'm in Rome with Caesar
On the road to Giza, beautiful like Testarossa features
Told the oldest teacher that control the only holy creature
Blow the fucking speaker with a vocal of the soulless leader
My cast is only feature, my rap's a Mona Lisa
A wack verse of me is as likely as a cold Ibiza
You got a 22 but do a lot of chopper talk
Me, I'm armed to the teeth, I let this fucking chopper bark
You make pill-poppin music, pussy, knock it off
Beat him to submission and then kick him like a soccer ball
Having everybody watching him bleed
Have to teach you motherfuckers how to talk to your seed
I'm from where young boys stash crack in their socks
And pop out on motherfuckers like a Jack in a box, dummy
