[Intro] Slaine
Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em
The coka is back
See we ain’t went nowhere anyways
I guess we under the underground
Fuck you motherfuckers

[Verse 1] Slaine
You say I lead a life that you would practically kill for
Crush it up and sniff it, if you could get it in pill form
‘Cause even in my high, I’m starting to feel horns forming in my head
And this bed is getting real warm
Get behind the wheel, drive but the windshield gone
Tires of the Benz, wheels spin but the sin feels wrong
I’ve tried to stop but I ain’t got the luxury
So I hide a Glock if somebody try to fuck with me
(It’s pop!)
But this ain’t no Madonna, Gaga, Michael Jackson
I’ve got a hyperactive, psychopathic type of passion
You can feel it in the air
They say that I’m an asshole, but I don’t really care
I was at the rock bottom yesterday, it’s best to say I scrapped
Obsessing over messages, the records playing back
In second grade they whispered by me just to say I’m cracked
When I heard ‘em I would hurt ‘em
It would escalate from that, Blah!


[Hook] Slaine

You know where we’re owed
On this dark day road
Tempers stay hot and the hearts stay cold
Kids stay stuck to the blocks they know
Drugs so good they cannot say no

Know what you`re owed
On the dark day road
Temper burn hot and your heart stay cold
Kids stay stuck to the blocks they know
Drugs so good they cannot say no


[Verse 2] Ill Bill

Dark visions, spark is the speak to god
Devil, this is speak your mind, mind your business
Creeped eyes, life has risen
Drive-by shooters wild riding in the hooptie lifting
Homicide shooters riot on you, fire superstition
Cock that, aim that, squeeze that
Shoot the steel
Cadillac Coupe DeVille
Wood grain on the grill
Cocaine in the pot
Baking soda, water hot
When the ice cubes drop, look at that
That's crack
Rap Prime Minister
Some say sinister
Spray up the courtroom, hit the jury and the witness
A barrel of crime
Crush head, crash with a bomb
Glass shatter in the car like they rang the alarm
I'm like alien grade heroin
They bang in they arm
Take me to the supreme leader then they crown me the god
Cult leader, I'm the peoples choice
Misunderstood is evil's voice
'Cause everything he touches he destroys


[Hook] Slaine

You know where we’re owed
On this dark day road
Tempers stay hot and the hearts stay cold
Kids stay stuck to the blocks they know
Drugs so good they cannot say no

Know what you're owed
On the dark day road
Temper burn hot and your heart stay cold
Kids stay stuck to the blocks they know
Drugs so good they cannot say no


(Drugs so good they cannot say no)
(We know what we're owed on this dark day road)
