[Intro:]
Heavy metal rules, heavy metal rules, all that punk shit sucks
It doesn't belong in this world, it belongs on fucking Mars, man
What the hell is punk shit? (Patience, patience!)
And Madonna, Madonna can go to hell as far as I'm concerned, she's a dick
I mean seriously, heavy metal definitely rules, Twisted Sister, Judas Priest, Dokken...
Ozzy, Scorpions, they all rule! Yeah, she's... tripping, Jack Daniels it all rules! All that shit rules!
This punk shit circle of shit and the dicks and all, that can go to hell, I don't care
Yeah, I don't really give a shit about that kind of punk fuck

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah
One two
Acid with Bear Stanley, I'm tryna see where the demons are
Jesus Christ heeded advice and followed the bleeding star
I told shorty to take me where the cathedrals are
All o' ya'll are phony and you're fruity like a freezer bar
You can't be the fucking man if you don't work for it
Nevermind meeting the Deacon - pleading in Church for it
I'll beat this fucking dummy with a surfboard
I wouldn't say I like to kill, it's more I thirst for it (yeah)
The synagogue of Satan, they was cursed for it
Shamash the God of Babylon my first thought
Banish this motherfucker from Earth for it
He made a mockery of God and he was cursed for it (cursed for it)
This is how a animal supposed to rap
Tristar Cobra shotty turn 'em like a Cul de Sac
I'm made of liquid metal like the Terminator
Bodies in a back, I kill a rat like the exterminator

[Hook x4]
Satan's first born
And the seance gone wrong
Spray the squad car
Shoot the cop through the door

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Iron armoured pistols, spiders the size of armadillos
Molly pills in ziplock bags the size of pillows
Speak from the gut
Fall for nothing, believe in less
Rather embrace suffering then achieve in death
Praise Jesus
Hate the real Carrie Underwood
Bricks blue and White like Aryan brotherhood
“Hail Satan” scribbled with a crayon on the wall
Pay with your soul, in a seance gone wrong
Angel Statues with bleeding eyes
Sentence my enemies to die
For centuries of treacheries and lies
His eyes resemble a throat slit by knives
Sleeps the cousin of death, but he functions like he’s alive
Shooters who would spray
Were Students of LaVey
Consuming the depraved
Until all humans are enslaved
Fatal Princes speak to demons through scriptures
Creep with pistols – squeeze a fistful
We official – leave you leaking "fo' shizzle"

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Goretex]
My spot fills green like trust funds
Blazing godfather, triple henny and dust blunts
Captain & Tennille, coke shades, I'm in the mass with gloves
Life's a bitch, I still fuck her till she shits blood
No more older sluts and inverted stunts
Arrogance of murder, I'll be upstate for thirty months
All I need is a dirty judge and a virgin muff
We run detergents on blocks so we can turn it up
Back up in your corpse paint
Grim to match the ceiling
Degenerate nihilist, super-violence to racketeering
My goon stay pushing that [?]
Every floor in the project like Lufthansa and Air France
[?] get that work from rastas
Mean streets like Johnny-boy exploding mail boxes
Coward like Row Carew ketamine in  my new suit
Bribing cops like feeding elephants at the fucking zoo

[Hook x4]

[Outro]
You're wild, man, WILD!
