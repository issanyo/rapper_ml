[Intro]
Ayo Stu, this ain't never coming out, right?
Watson and Holmes
Yeah, you know
Watson and Holmes, nigga
Yeah, you know
Yeah, you know
Start

[Verse 1: Blacastan]
I'm a savage magician, a time travelling wizard
A violent technician with a javelin's precision
On course for collision, after lunch going fishing
Collecting my thoughts for everything that I'm missing
Escaping a prison, we inventing new religions
Impairing your vision like black ops on a mission
Can't make a decision while I'm making incision
A chemist in a lab with this nuclear fission, listen
I can't stand no more whining and bitching
If you can't stand the heat then close the door in the kitchen
And stop with the talk about how much you fishing
Niggas is catching a vibe like a ball in a mitten
I'm dumping out your trunk, this is live transmitting
No jive when I describe the bitches that I'm hitting
Only smash pussy cats, never hit kittens
My notebook is filled to the top with good writtens

[Chorus]
Subtract, de-de-delete
De-de-de-de-de-delete
Delete, delete
Subtract, de-de-delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way, way back
Coming from way, way
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way, way back

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Yo, I'm that aura that permeate through bank robber flicks
I'm apocalypse, darker than what's inside Dahmer's fridge
Make you question whether or not God exists
Building for hours, high on the loudest piff
Sneaker Spielberg, I'm outtie in the whip
And hot be burning, it be cloudy in the crib
Get drunk and start hockey brawls
It's a lot of y'all, suicidal like Rocky George
I'm OG like Rocky IV
Spread your party like spumante or bukkake porn
Shoot first, die later
I'm the defender of the faith, the annihilator
Blood everywhere smelling like copper pennies
Get shot in the head, salute you with a shot of Henny
Ill Bill a.k.a. go fuck yourself
Only homie that I truly know, but trust is dealt
Murder with ease, murder police
Only heros in the hood: beef, turkey and cheese
Push you to a mush, shooters at hoods
Spray the pistol out the window of the Uber then push

[Chorus]
Subtract, de-de-delete
De-de-de-de-de-delete
Delete, delete
Subtract, de-de-delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way, way back
Coming from way, way
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way, way back

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
You don't stop, let me plan my [?]
Nah, let me cast my vote
Let me demote another wack nigga thinkin' he dope
I'm on stage via satellite, live, remote
Open my coat like a cloak then I started to float
I got brand new kicks on, cleaner than soap
Look, lay off the keyboard, sampling's dope
The archbishop in the Vatican disguised as the Pope
Tryna raid the whole stash and take all of their coke
Call me Blacastanley Kubrick, murder I wrote
I'm the feeling that you feel as hired murderers approach
Shout out to the west coast, khakis and Locs
And Pelican Bay with lifers as the riots provoke
Strictly underground, nigga, no yachts, no boats
With a braggadocious style, I earn a right to boast
For the rap game, I'd like to make this toast
Man, I catch y'all niggas later but for now I'm ghost

[Chorus]
Subtract, de-de-delete
De-de-de-de-de-delete
Delete, delete
Subtract, de-de-delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way, way back
Coming from way, way
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way, way back
