[VERSE 1: ILL BILL]
I'm getting between your nerves like leprosy
Using mental telepathy, my treachery;
Stretches over centuries, I never meant to be;
Reincarnated - matter of fact if it was up to me
I'd wish that I had never been created
Them swinging swords hoards in phycho wards
Walking threw forbidden doors and then went inside of the morgue
People grimace when they witness business of the bloody instance
So keep your distance the smell of bodies is covered by incense
I show no mercy; blood splats up on my hockey jersey
Simular to physicians in rooms of emergency
So fuck the gats id rather hit you with an axe
Laugh while your skull cracks; but I'm still not happy

[Hook] X2
ALL I REALLY WANT
IS TO BE HAPPY
TO FIND A LOVE THAT'S MINE
IT WOULD BE SO SWEET

[VERSE 2: ILL BILL]
I'm turning red blood cells into dead blood cells
Using microscopic utensils within your entrails
Pushing the limits of your chromosomes
Sitting on the throne made of humans bones
Talking in my cellular phone, I walk alone
Into pandemonium utilizing plutonium
To build a bigger, better stronger weapon
I sense the presence of great evil; so I erase
And drain every bit of the power source conceivable
Bringing about the beginning of ending;
Sending the crucifieer; tending to your so called messiah
Within the fire, I eulogize planetary demise;
Felling energized as another planet dies
And nothing could ever really make me give a fuck about
Any thing you care about, so why even bother?
The blood I spill can fill the entire new york harbour
So hang the holy father and light the candelabra

[Hook] X2
ALL I REALLY WANT
IS TO BE HAPPY
TO FIND A LOVE THAT'S MINE
IT WOULD BE SO SWEET

[VERSE 3: ILL]
I'm slowly killing myself to live, I couldn't even begin
To explain the effect of the drugs on my brain;
Nothing positive can influence the trip I take
I'm driven by the negativity that instigates
Without a doubt the bloody body count increases
You fall to pieces, my mouth releases terminal diseases
And everywhere you look there's another dead fucking shnook
Hanging from a bloody meat hook; I always keep a smile on my face
So I can hide whats really going on inside of my mind
I feel nothing and therefore I am nothing
I thrive upon your suffering but theres nothing
That makes me feel happpy

[Hook] X2
ALL I REALLY WANT
IS TO BE HAPPY
TO FIND A LOVE THAT'S MINE
IT WOULD BE SO SWEET
