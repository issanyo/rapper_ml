[Hook: Steven King]

I hear loud niggas talking but they don’t really want it
My gauge’ll blow your motherfucking brains out
Soon as you act retarded the gat’ll start sparking
I’ll show you what my motherfucking name bout
I’mma do what I gotta do, I ain’t taking no shorts
And get away clean cause I paid off the courts
It’s real, duke, I ain’t playing, this shit ain’t a game
I’mma burn you to flames cause Howie made me do it

[Verse 1: Steven King]

It’s Steven King, I spit nothing but classics
And it’s ill how I turn beef to nothing but caskets
And your grill look like the Expedition done crashed it
I’m like a bunny rabbit, I be taking your carats
More money more drama, don’t make me catch an open case
For opening your face, you’re soft like Hostess cake
I wanna live fat, I gotta eat what Oprah ate
So I hold niggas up with the one plus eight
I’m the man of the year
You so whack that niggas put their hands on their ears
And tell you, “Shut the fuck up.”
And the only dog that roll with you is on the Fedex truck
Now here’s the score: ten-zip and I ain’t talking about the disc
I’m talking about extended clips, smoking in expensive whips
Four-four’s the end of shit, give you a Hell’s membership
I been equipped, don’t ever forget it like elephants
You violate I’ll put a hole in your melon

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]

You like a campfire, homes, I light you up with all types of guns
The vampire, homes, I’m drinking all nine pints of blood
Stop you in your tracks like clogged up syringes
Destroy the evidence after I chopped up the witness
A cheapskate, I keep my money locked up for interest
Fuck the industry, y’all faggots make me not trust the business
Ill Bill, right money make a murder make sense
I make brains squirt out their heads right in front of their friends
I ain’t a nice guy at all, dog, lifestyle raw y’all
Sell drugs, tour, smoke nudies, and fuck whores
Got black bitches with white eye shadow that like to swallow
And white bitches that pop their pussies for Heineken bottles
I’m a dirtbag with brand new sneakers, throwback over the Desert Eagle
Blow your face off, leave you forever peaceful
Like a newborn dead inside of a crib
I cock back, empty Dessies in the side of your wig, faggot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Syn Roc]

Too hot, create semi caliber, I’mma cock it
I treat your life like a cheque, homeboy I’mma dock it
Call me a prophet, it’s guaranteed you all gonna bleed
The murder game is a race and I’m taking the lead
Fast and furious nigga like my gun got nitro
Playing games like Tyco, mama told me I’m psycho
And I believe her, now the clique running streets like cheetahs
We’ll meet up and put holes all in your wifebeaters
From BK to Queens we be pointing them things
Have your Ecko shirt looking like some damaged jeans nigga
It’s Syn Roc, the kid who got your grandpop shot
Over a game of bingo, I take the cream out his socks
In a cloud of weed is the place where you find me
And I stole drink forties like I’m stuck in the 90’s
Nigga I’m grimy, wilding on the alcho temp
Try to front on me and get hit with sixteen clips

[Hook]

[Verse 4: E-Dot]

Alright ahk who wanna fuck round?
It’s the Dot, you hear the pop nigga duck down
? canuck, I’m repping cop killer Bucktown
That good up in the backwood rough sound
Begging for mercy talking about, “Alright. Enough now.”
Hold up and y’all hammers bust pow
Enough, get touched like ooh ah ow
You suck, push your luck, get laid the fuck down
Get bucked, I was a wild off the hook child
Played tough plus steroids came in big viles
Puff puff puff liked to buy weed in big pounds
Crack that Dutch, I ain’t addicted I’m just in denial
When I blow then I flow like the river Nile
Find you anywhere like your cellphone, can you hear me now?
Grab you by your hair and shake it till I tear it out
I’m sorta like mildly retarded but very wild
Cause Howie made me do it, stupid
