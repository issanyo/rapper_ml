[Ill Bill]
First and foremost, a toast to my Mom & my Pop
My daughter and my wife, there’s no one more important in my life
Without them I wouldn’t be alive in the literal sense
And in the mind, they are my inspiration to grind
My reason to live, rest in peace to my grandmothers and my uncles
Y'all molded the person I became and for that I love you
It’s difficult to explain through lyrics how much I miss you
Please accept any success I’ve achieved as a tribute
A testament to your impact
And influence on everything I’ve ever did, you’ll forever live
I never been a religious person but still bear witness to a higher power
Some only pray in their final hour
But I remain grateful for my blessings
Thankful to the most high, for the many gifts whether present
Past or futuristic, blessed to be able to express myself through words
And give thanks using the lyrics

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
I feel very grateful, very humble
I wanna thank everyone
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
I just wanna say… thanks… thank you

[Ill Bill]
Secondly I’d like to address where it all popped
From Farragut Road to your block
Gargling booze, and saw god sparking a doob
Marketing crude, sharpening tools, we're martyrs & goon shooters
That shoot constant modern day Goose Gossage
Ice cold though, Siberian summers appear hotter
Quite bold like a Nigerian underwear bomber
Dope war, folklore, coke whore smoke more
Morbid epitaph, Sordid tortured past provoke more
Try to stab me with a knife to be exact
Spitefully attacked, trifling and wack, grimier in fact
Than any award or any rap, any whore or any rat
Close the door on petty crap
Very happy, thankful to my best of friends
Had to cut ties with any of the very many snakes in the grass that left me for dead
Dumped in the river, swept in the ocean
Heavy emotion, stand firm though the end is approaching, I’m open

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
Ladies and gentleman, a real round of applause
Yall appointed me to bring rap justice
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
It’s truly fantastic
To show our appreciation for you

[Ill Bill]
Lastly I’d like to thank all my influences
And various inspirational individuals that got me in the music business
I'm a fan first so I appreciate mines
Thanks to my fans, you're my family, I take pride
In your support and every album you bought
Down for life, I love y'all for never doubting your boy
Same way I love LL Cool J and Kiss
One made me wanna rock, the other made me wanna spit
Rick Rubin made me wanna flip em both at the same time
Slayer and Scarface inspired me to write insane rhymes
Thanks to L'Amours in Brooklyn accepting my fake ID
Opened for Sepultura there when I was only 17
Thanks to my band Injustice
Thanks to Ace London Studios for letting us rehearse when we ain’t have nothing
And shouts to all of y'all that said I couldn’t do it
You gave me the fire to kick down the door and walk through it

(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
I feel very grateful, very humble
And I owe thanks to many, many people
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
What more could I say? I wouldn’t be here today if the old school didn’t pave the way
