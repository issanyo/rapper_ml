*** MC known as Science is now known as I-Con ***

[I-Con]
Apocalyptic, born to spit it
Niggas thinking the Lord did it
Regardless of their efforts to be the hardest, critics
Y'all with it, if not my verbs spit shots
Give your ass the equvalent of a stiff cock
I'm still hot, despite the ice of a wrist watch
Sip scotch J and B, flow type dynamite, TNT
Spend grandly, with explosive
Spit fire raps and holsters
I make heat smolter with a quick draw
Verbal four fifth y'all, contrast your raps are mere spit balls
If y'all think y'all can be defenders
Hit y'all with more sentences than repeat offenders
Will we surrender? NO
Though keep steady rocking with chances of stoppin me
Lower than finding a newborn able to take sodomy calmly
How do you adore me, strips some beef which informs me
The fame or the army
[Goretex]
With bare feet I walk the desert feelig no heat
Beliefs of dangers live up on the street, holding my meat
Shoot up the Earth that we rejoice in prayer
We never care, and groupie tours are busting enema bags and coke stares
Racking mass we rock annual
I'm coming out, I'm that bastard son of a shocking cannibal
With mad clout, ain't no way out
I think I was made to degrade you
Pull your eyes brains and veins out, to watch you change you
Lyrically I raised you, but I'm going to smash you for spite
Bash you with mics, before the head be stashed on ice
Non Phixion, Obsucre we together for war
Fallout, remaining soldiers in 2004

[A-Trak - turntablism]

"Obscure"  "Disorder"
"Slapping you senseless"
"You know the feeling when things ain't right"
"When these Non Phixion niggas start to rap on the mic"
"Non Phixion"   "Obscure"
"Hit you with two doses of dopeness"

[Eclipse]
Early to bed, early to rise
Make a man healthy and wise
For losing over sleep out of spite
There ain't no sunshine battling with space and time
Continue in obliviance, to tell you dealing with crime
And then the plot twist, solidary game of risk
It's like a death wish, this style comes so unfortunate
Well my blood coagulates between the good and the bad
Suddenly I'm all red. so my system so sags
Different state of mind, my watts emphasize on the size
Money bags stash in the Caymen Isles, more interest on the rise
You still wondering why, the Earth hails storms and cries
Just one guy with a black eye, Non Phixion from the NY
Want it back, by the bent ride
If you're deaf, nigga rewind
Full slept, fill the chalkline
O-D, is on the war crime
[Ill Bill]
You gots to murder me cause suicide's your only other option
Run up in your crib and blast ya, while your mother's watching
Shot the president, then the pope mobile
Exploded the mobil phones and global fear
End of the fucking world is here, we come prepared
Part through customs with a gat, the new shit
You know a laser gun, days of rubble like signing Quebec acts as a raver
Drug
Fuck it, I be the ill pilgrim
Decaptiate MC's in such a way you had to know that Ill Bill killed them
Harlem world tour, should have mind for you with Obscure
Spit the pure, uncut raw coke for all of y'all
Two jealous cats be get fucked up quick
Step to us you get shot stabbed knocked our or pistol whipped
Smack you the fuck backwards, invisible gat post wrapped plastic
Fat bitches with fat asses that into lap dances
Y'all that hate me, you can suck my motherfucking dick
Ask how you could not know the name by now
It's Non Phixion bitch

"With goons and hardrocks, but wait it's on me"
"Collaborate with"   "Dave-One"
"Hey yo I'm feeling it"
"Cause this is how it should be done"
