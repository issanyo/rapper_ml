This is I'll Bill, kill the police kill the president kill the police
I go from Brooklyn to Baghdad to Little Rock, pistols pop
You get fucked up like an airline stewardess bitches twat
Listen up, my brain erupt like volcanoes
Hotter than jalepanos
Half a yall rappers faggots taking it in the a-hole
I spray chrome, at your dome
Like crime out, wile out
I pull the nine out
Bust my nut in a dimes mouth
I shout loud, but y'all on time out
You get your mind drowned, head wetted up
Red with blood I smile proud
Spit the real, like the twelve tribes of Israel
Gangsta but I still don't want nobody's kid killed
I spilled enough blood, slinged enough drugs
To them children and innocent
But the rest of ya'll faggots can eat a dick
I don't like non of ya'll never did
Non Phixion forever kid
We negative I stay anti
I tried to play it cool but the plan died
Landslide avalanche casteration
Masturbation assassination of the fascist nation
Exasperation, nuclear warhead evaporation
Aggrevasion lepresy laceration
Fall to pieces, talk to Jesus
Walk though Galilee with torches creepin
