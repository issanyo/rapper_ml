[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
I’m like a Viking in a submarine, or a Spartan with guns and beams
Muggs and me is like giving hard drugs to fiends
I be the cause of this prison riot, sworn to the Israelites
Torture you with kitchen knifes, scorch you in a pistol fight
I saw prophets tore from the fist of Christ
Propaganda brainwashes us to make us think their system’s right
I stick my finger in the dyke, plug the leak
While she sucked her teeth, look into the light, such is life

[Verse 2: B-Real]
So when I hold the mic frighting day and night
Might catch a case, see you in my sights, let my heater make you change your face
Make you change your ways, wishing you could change your days
The venom we spit cut your throat like a razor blade
They got hell to pay, me I got hell to raise
Looked death in the eye, he said you get a stellar gaze
He went on his way but he got stuck in the maze
Without any way to get out of this purple haze

[Hook: Ill Bill]
Evacuate the place, fallen angel, amputated saint
Trapped on a cannibal planet of hate, gang-related is they faith
Activate the tape, calculate the weight
Single-handed with the cannon in their face

Evacuate the place, fallen angel, amputated saint
Trapped on a cannibal planet of hate, gang-related is they faith
Activate the tape, calculate the weight
Single-handed with the cannon in their face

[Interlude: Ill Bill]
Abandon all hope, buy more weapons and more coke
Build yourself a bunker under your house, it’s all over
But before the CIA come to take us away
Light up some OG kush and take us out in a blaze

Abandon all hope, buy more weapons and more coke
Build yourself a bunker under your house, it’s all over
But before the CIA come to take us away
Light up some OG kush and take us out in a blaze

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
I ate some brownies last week and I’ve been high for days
Should’ve known B-Real was the guy with the tray
Cheech and Chong spliff, twist up an entire eighth
It won’t freeze your nose, the shit’ll set fire to your face

[Verse 3: B-Real]
We get higher in the place, still my eyes are clean
I’m the man in all black with the hashisheen
So many bags of green candy cars that lean
Got a crew so thick man we causing a scene
You tried to hit it the very moment I lit it
You shitted your pants, coughing out your lungs, bitch quit it
We got the greenery and the heavy machinery
And life don’t mean a thing to me, bitch enjoy the scenery
