[Hook: ]
Everybody down

[Verse 1: ]
Here is the loco with the coco, put it in your veins
I'm the last bullet in the pistol, put it in your brain
Run up on you with your wrong show, took your chain
Didn't even touch you, my prescene alone shook your brain
I'm the product of some fucked up parents
The one good thing that, come out of their fucked up marriage
Out of severe stress comes diamonds to cut up karats
And we revere death plus violence, cut up faggots
I'm a member of the LCN, don't get pistol whip
La Coka Nostra membership has it's privileges
And I'm a 5 star general in fact
When I get vex, It's like a biochemical attack
Stop lying to your self homes, you are terrible at rap
Stop trying to be a tough guy, you terrible at that
It's the Cult leader represent La Coka Nostra, creeps
We toast constantly with beats that keep us focus

[Hook: ]

[Verse 2: ]
It's not wise to agitate pit bull, rottweiler and spike dog collars
When your style is tight, novels like knowledge you's not polished
I got that Oswald flow, explode flow from the grassy knollism
And snipe from the towers in Dallas, palace to malice on site
Start your breath when you're marked for death
Rocket launch ripped through your flesh and tear apart your chest
Buy a record, t-shirt, CD, and a poster
Do that make you a soldier, La Coka Nostra?
I don't know, but the army's swelling with junkie scumbags
Ex-cons, and felons, innocent civilians
And kill them for the thrill of the hunt
I'm in the Mandalay, all tens, LCN tatted on the cunt
Jaysaun, what these niggas need, they only got to ask
Can't measure one's treasure another man's trash
Whatever your pleasure, nigga, hash, ass, or grass
I got you,  it's a sneeze, we keep the bean on smash

[Hook: ]

[Verse 3: ]
I'm back at it, the lunatic up at the liquor store
The Romans stick to punches laying your head split, hits the floor
Swear I said this shit before, you just didn't listen
Now I'm back at pissing in the wells that you's a wishin'
I'm on a mission, my position is a sick of source
Society is psycho with the cycle trying to get us all
Some people hate you, some decide to ride your dick and balls
Some are homicidal, get high as ? and sneak 'em all
Colorado, hot money, greener than avocado
My Movado watch price ? in my lotto models
These are just a few things our American scams
We scratch our balls now north porn, heroin and jam
The snakes in the grass, the circus a serpents in town
He curses church, worships devils and murks in the sound
As berserk as it sounds, the Earth perfectly round
I drink some whiskey, wash these Percocets down

[Hook: ]

[Verse 4: ]
Return of the king, they heard of the murderer I bring
Learn under my wing, the burner is gonna sting
Rookie rappers can't focus their eyes is blurred
Now work the perfect chemistry method like Heisenberg
Walter White, paranoia, snort the white
Lick a gorgeous dyke, fall victim to a stalkers knife
Keep tweeting for peace, I'm a freak on a leash leaving you defeat and deceased, dog
I'm a beast on the streets
Twin sisters is hype, grab for my hard penis
Capital weapon ex in love with the dark phoenix
My thoughts are covered in sin, my torture dumber than grim
One to the chin, let the phoenix, now I'm rubbing to win
Rappers rapping about rapping can catch a stabin'
Drag them off to the back and pass them off with a magnum
Don't confuse consistence with skill level
Cause I'm a god in this rap shit and I fuckin' kill devils
