[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Ill Bill keep it real like the 80's when we flooded the projects
Or like Ollie North when he funded the Contras
Like Cody Sky homie we constructed a monster
Holding the Glock postin’ yes we run for the chopper
It’s a black carpet event, martyrs (in jets) start up a pit
Who the fuck pop off harder than this
When I hit you the impact is like if God had a fist
I’m hollow tip my every molecule is part of the clip
I’ve been (lied) apart sick show a part of the chip
I’m not (showby) on the shadow of a doubt if I exist
Bitch talked up papy for discount on the brick
Kid walked up cocky got shot in the dick
Finance is a gun, politics is knowing when to pull the trigger
Electric heretic the zig-zag zigga
With the Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head, God descends
Part of the spiritually dead, pop the pistol through your head
Brooklyn 1986 Nike sneakers and beamers
Teenagers buying keys from drug dealers named Jesus
We the reason for the Secret Service
Posted in trees with burners, exploding like a overheating furnace

[Hook: ILL Bill] (x2)
I seen the truth rise and fall the (?) were born
Fuck the system, fuck who I offend these whores
Shout words that we live but don’t play with it
'Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it

[Verse 2: Goretex]
They call me  matzah ball, I'm mixing with an isotol
Cause Howie told me the proper cull when the cops get called
Active as [?] fourty boxes like rockin tour
From the projects to going hungry selling rocks of war
Like Nicky Sixx live wire, Spawn born of fire
The two messiahs
It's over, the Elohim and Billy Squire
The body and the trumpet, ?smell it for a week?
What you wanna do, bury it and burn it, then burn leak
Belt Parkway like I'm Roy DeMeo
Chop you in the tub for yayo
Run it by bengals, piano wire, million pesos
If we on the grid we sit with no payloads
Like [?] respect with umbrellas to [?]
I've seen the truth
I got scars from ?stay foes?
And dead homies, kissing their casket on final way home
Demented retribution canted with the congregation
Blessed to death, the angel, goodbye to meditation

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Sample]
That piece of shit up there, I never liked him, I never trusted him
For all I know he had me set up and had my friend Angel Fernandez killed
But that's history
I'm here, he's not
Do you wanna go on with me, you say it
You don't, then you make a move
