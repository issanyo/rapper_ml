[Verse 1: Slaine]
Dudes are full of jealousy, they bitches and liars
Pussy and cocaine are kings so the biscuits are fired
Won't stop me from fuckin' or gettin snipped till' I'm wired
I'm just sayin' how I feel cause this shit's got me tired
I'm exhausted, by my street hustle, but it caused it
Death echo around in my town, it had me nauseous
And I ain't talkin' bout' the film that you see me in
I'm talkin' bout the snakes tryin' to kill him in the green BM
My guns are loaded, my mind is out of my head
My sons my motive my grind is hide till' I'm dead
My nines exploded, my enemies started a ble-??
Fishes will bleed, once the missions with me(?)
I'll put a body on it, wipe it, give you pistols for free
You's a small timer, ain't no one as vicious as me
I'm the dark angel scriptures that religits can read
This is real, think its hard to believe? THE FUCK OUTA HERE!

[Hook x2: Big Left]
God is great, guard your space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I heard crack so much, it's hard to ace
.38 revolver flow, it's hard to trace

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
[???????????????] Like rockin' a rollie and polo
Competition screams uncle like Napoleon Solo
You think education is expensive? try ignorance instead
Try a pistol to your head, now you're bringing in the bread
Seal with the fists
Half a dozen gunmen, hate amongst brothers
Once powerful empires crumble up into nothing
Everything is started as a thought
So-called reality is a matrix that's transmitted by brain regions
Across optical and neurological modules
Throw cars with our minds like Chronicle, nothings impossible
I could beat you with the barrels, then heat you with the hollows
Be in Giza with the pharaohs, and then have pizza at the [?]
Brought the devil to your house, say hi to Satan
Then put the metal in your mouth like Iron Maiden
I'm a cross between Mike Tyson and a ice titan
White lightning, beats and thundering lyrics are quite frightening

[Hook x2: Big Left]
God is great, guard your space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I heard crack so much, it's hard to ace
.38 revolver flow, it's hard to trace

[Verse 3: Big Left]
Necronomicom-bat I'll leave it at that
Leavin' the game, hallucinations only even the plain
Look, I'm keepin' it cane, I mean coke
Replacing the pope, keep the long arm in the coat
You want the serial killer shit?
Late night, break in the house
Throw the dog a steak, and fuck your wife on the couch
I'm wiping em' out, murder fuckin' kids in their bed
Ted Bundy cause I'm takin' the head
Lefts not back, I'm a thought, a dream, a concept
Ready for combat, go ahead and pull the trigger
You want that, welcome to the grid of reverse reality
Im'a use a program mentality, salary
John 3:16, I'm seeing the gleam, see in your eyes
Seeing you believing the lies
Motherfuckers are never nice guys, remember that
All your faggots talk shit from the back, come on man

[Hook x2: Big Left]
God is great, guard your space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I heard crack so much, it's hard to ace
.38 revolver flow, it's hard to trace
