[Intro: Uncle Howie and ILL Bill]
Howie: It's good, it's good, making some money illegally, you know, like always
Bill: Illegally?
Howie: Always

[Verse 1: Q-Unique]
This is target practice
Guerilla warfare black market tactics
Biblical secret scrolls hidden in the federal building
Uncover the mystery with meddling children

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
Devilish villains, a violation, entire nations rise, tides are changing
Annihilation of the sky when my mind is racing
I place a cruise of calm in the white station
Vibrations through my arm when the nine's blazing

[Verse 3: Q-Unique]
It’s mine's for the taking, I point the snub nose
Pull out the bamboo, homie, and get your drugs rolled
The bundle of dimes hit the corner with the stash
I’m in front of the line like the shortest in the class

[Verse 4: ILL Bill]
Get the torture goons with caps, crews attack with the Uzi clap
Swiss-cheese you up, make you do a foolish dance
My nine will make you lambada, my pistol make you do the limbo
My Mac-11 make you do the windmill

[Verse 5: Q-Unique]
It’s simple, I’m with Slippin’ Jimmy scheming on the cash
Wear a mask made for skiing demons armed with gats
Wanna cosplay and slay with the steel?
I’m a real Rocksteady against the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D

[Verse 6: ILL Bill]
Satan is real, Lucifer’s a shooter, put a bullet in your Buddha
Kill your idol with the Ruger and a little humor
Get a hollow but creep stealthily, away to Cuba
Drink a bottle of chemotherapy and spit a tumor

[Verse 7: Q-Unique]
Spread a rumor about a terrorist organization
Beheading consumers with the president’s authorization
Sleeper cells kept in a basement deep as hell
Trigger the hammer, smack the primer and heat the shell

[Verse 8: ILL Bill]
Enter the dragon, splash the face and take a seat to chill
You could throw away the motherfucking key, keep the bail
Keep my confiscated cocaine, read my mail
Sell my story to Martin Scorsese and grieve my tale
