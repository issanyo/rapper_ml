El Gant, Ill Bill
Yeah, ?
It officially starts now
El Gant and Ill Bill, ha

[Verse 1: El Gant]

I’m giving you something you’ve never seen
Listen close, this is not a dream
Wake up from surgery, feel the doctor poke at your spleen
I’m from a place cause a racist cop will choke out a teen
Then leave him slumped in the street and beaten
That’s how it seems
Yo, what the fuck you mean? This life ain’t natural
Don’t make touch on government, the streets are like the capital
And Christianity is magical, they make you think
That you cannot finish a date without smoking, I’ll take a drink
This is not a story, some think it’s all a game
Most of us sold to the Devil just for a taste of fame
And so they pull something heavy, metal splatter your brain
It’s not a game when you watch a pistol shatter your frame
It’s pain and pleasure, you mix a little together
Then let it rise to the top and then popping, you get the measure
The president is a veteran sodomizing his people
To make you believe the words that he’s speaking
Naturally evil

[Hook]

This is that heavy metal shit
Don’t even meddle with
I keep a four just in case yo I gotta settle shit
You ain’t a veteran, I got some medicine
Don’t even act like you’re tough, homie
You’re better then
And this ain’t for the radio, don’t even play it, ho
The metal music to lose it, you know it’s crazy yo
And this is how it’s going down, let off a hundred rounds
Of metal music now can you hear the sound?

[Ill Bill]

I’m giving you heroin for your ears
Listen close, homie. This is dope
Get your adrenaline pumping like you was sniffing coke
Ride the lightning, cult leader my mind’s frightening
I drink blood from a human skull like a Viking
To toast the death of my enemies
I command an army of blood thirsty murderers with heads like machines
I’m the future of this piece of shit scene
Abandon all hope and these fake fucking faggots
I’mma snatch up all their bling
Got you stuck in the moment, zoning advanced but fucked up like cloning
I’m the evolution of super soldiers
Human vultures, better yet I’m exploding like super novas
Moving in circles of tyrannical goons with toasters
The face of the Devil, chased by the bass and the treble
The gunfight erupts amongst fallen saints in the temple
This is Ill Bill making the metal bang like Slip Knot
With twin Glocks, thirty-six shots, you get your wig popped

[Hook]

It officially starts, the takeover, the takeover
