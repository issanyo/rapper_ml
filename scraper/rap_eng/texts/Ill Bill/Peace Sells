[Verse 1]
I'm the Kreator of Terrible Certainty, it's No Escape from the Toxic Trace
Pop your face, Storming With Menace and Blind Faith
The Angel of Death Read Between the Lies South Of Heaven
Expendable Youth, Divine Intervention
Teaching y'all A Lesson In Violence
Doctor Death injecting the virus, apocalypse
I'm a horseman in the Circle Of Tyrants
And death's the era, Posessed like Jeff Becerra
Consuming Impulses drown you in the depths of terror, forever

[Hook]
Peace Sells, But Who's Buying?
Who's trying?, who's crying?, who's lying in a pool of blood dying?
Peace Sells But Who's Buying?
Who's trying?, who's crying?, who's poppin' with the four pound iron?
Peace Sells But Who's Buying?
Who's trying?, who's crying?, who's lying in a pool of blood dying?
Peace Sells But Who's Buying?
Who's trying?, who's crying?, who's lying in a pool of blood?

[Verse 2]
Stranded In Hell, My America dated Betrayal
Brainwashed by a system that's created to fail
Freedom Or Fire, Securitron, ominous fate
Fear Factory manufacturing Hi-Tech Hate
A Slave New World, world gone mad, A World Without Heroes
Used to go to shows surrounded by weirdos
Live at L'amours, mastering the science of war
Reading Metal Forces Magazines dying to tour
Biohazards and Carnivores, living a Life Of Agony
Where to go, We Gotta Know like Harley Flanagan
Electric Funeral, Children Of The Grave Behind The Wall Of Sleep
Be afraid, killing to be saved
I Don't Need Society, Down For Life, foul and trife
Ill Bill, Dirty Rotten Imbecile, down to fight
Give Me My Taxes Back, money, God's a liar
Speak truth to Def Americans like Tom Araya

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Psychic Vacuum, jab you with a knife & stab you
Ravenous Medicine, Tribal Convictions, it's heroin
Experiment, Macrosolutions To Megaproblems
Let the revolvers solve 'em, Chaos Mongers, a Cosmic Drama
Peace Sells But Who's Buying, so I stay with the funds
We're real, so you die and find you laced with the slugs
With The Quickness you calling me my Sacred Love
I got Bad Brains, the reason I spray with guns, now listen

[Hook]
