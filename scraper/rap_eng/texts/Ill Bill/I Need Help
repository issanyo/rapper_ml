[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Down-trodden and rock bottom
My mind’s rotten, I’m a goblin
With shotguns and vodka I’m a problem
White devil caucozoid mutant
Built to destroy humans
Fuck love, give me guns, I enjoy shooting
Columbine, chaos and fury, lyrics and mayhem
Witches of Salem congregate on a mission for Satan
Ain't these recipes for treachery
The system is tainted
Linked to destiny, the rest of me religion and hatred
Rather be risen in flames than be driven insane
Living in pain, my brain sizzling in the drizzling rain
Whisper insane thoughts
Echoes and loss
Lepers and Whores
Desperate remorse
My epitaph etched in the walls, I'm lost
Between green Hell and betrayal, we fell
But if we social hopefully we'll prevail
Compared to who I once was I'm a shell
Broken into so many pieces I fell
I need some motherfucking help
