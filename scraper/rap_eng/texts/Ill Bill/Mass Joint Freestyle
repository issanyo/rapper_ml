I rip a hole in time and walk through it - I talk through it
Like a terrorist holding guns and heads of hostages
Gangster apocalypse, thug holocaust
Throwing molotovs at ground-zero
Carnovore, like Pete Steel(?) the art of war
Kill the matador, kill the man with the bull
I shatter your jaw
I battle you all
It's like the end of day show
Criminals calling cocaine snow
Doing blunts, blood splatters when they blow they nose
The rap Tom Green, I rap obscene
They try to throw my album on NASA(?)
And Lars Ulrich from Metallica
Super black market, we doped up like track markings
Run up on cop cars and blast sergeants
The rock legend
In every magazine my cock's mentioned
I leave the competition chopped headless, drowning in red piss
It's Ill Bill, murder-murder kill-kill
Run for the hills
We thugging like ?

Officer down!
