[Verse 1: Oprime39]
Check, check... this that Peruvian... you know
OK I reloaded, the X5 fully loaded
Pressed for time toss the tech 9 into the ocean
Colleges cite the notes that they quote me in
Scriptures from the holiest
Live at the Smithsonian
You cats pussy juice drippin' out fallopians
Oprime39 write rhymes that's opium
Roxicet, it's science how we rock the set
From out of left rockets ricochet to scar your flesh
Rappin' renegade with retard strength
Iron fist guaranteed I'm caving in y'all chest
More less watch what you say to me
I chef raps till they savory, insane to see how I cook using A-Z
All day gourmet, that raw grade more bars than Rahway
Trick bitches in the hallway
'bout to chisel my initials on your tombstone
Been official dipped the Wally's now they two-toned

[Verse 2: ILL BILL]
Who the fuck you lying to?
You trippin' you must be high on shrooms
You vagina juice, I only rhyme with goons
And that's the TIMELESS TRUTH
Claiming you wild and shoot
But your frame's riot proof
Drag you up a staircase and fling you off the highest roof
Take it back like the Coliseum buying jewels
Violent dudes pop the fuck off, like we frying food
You better off trying to sign a truce you pussy
You might as well tie your tubes
You stand behind guys with lube
The game used to be all about the livest crews
Then Kanye blew, now only if you gay the labels signing you
Watered down and safe like a guy in a tie and suit
I slaughter clowns, I ain't relying on nobody's loot
Started a business like Ralphie Lipshitz
Carnasie pimp shit, politic till I got links like Slick Rick
Sick kicks when you see'em you feel hurt
Kill yourself, I'm out, ILL BILL sneaker Spielbergs

[Verse 3: Solace]
Persian carpets, oil portraits
Kept surveillance to surround the fortress
Die with the glory never forfeit
Dressed to kill put a body on the garments
S&P 500 on the markets
Kind of awkward how they wanna see me off it
The same ones I spilled blood for and life I offered
Would've slept six feet deep up in a coffin
Queens trife life sometimes happen to often
Rap for the street, flagship of the fleet
Black chips under the mattress if we have to retreat
Skatin' with an Asian actress in the passenger seat
And my Gs follow suit, ten Maximas deep
Then we gather at the gala, sippin at Cipriani's
Tailored Ralphie, while she drippin' in Gianni
Versace, medusa faces cover the temples
Hawk eyes and eagle looks leather bound legal books
Learning law cuz we the crooks, now we freak the juxx
