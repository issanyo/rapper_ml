You don’t, it’s what used to happen to me today
A girl on that line when I was picking up my methanine
She was getting that methananoptomy
She said hey, it’s unbelievable
You got somebody, the shit it takes, it keeps bouncing back
You know what I mean? I have seizures 3 times a fuck on week
I domidos once a week every week
I wake up in the emergency room a minimum of 2 times a week
You know what I’m sayin?
And I, my body just recuperates
I don’t, I don’t know how
But I don’t know how long it’s gonna last so…
