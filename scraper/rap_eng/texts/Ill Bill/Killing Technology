[Hook: Ill Bill]
Float in your home with a
Exploding drone
Blow off your dome with a
Exploding phone
(x4)

[Verse 1: Goretex]
Medical students, ex-cons [?]
We never waste the aprons here only for head shootings
Tex Watson eighty shots to the head's drooping
Make your skull [?]
Drain your plasma like [?] filters on true Mitzvah
Suzuki sidekick getting throat from two shiksas
Some Gucci frames, like Danon David, I'm making rain
Extended clips, I promise you, I hit a major vein
Tough sweaters, God lectors and drug ghettos
Carve your cerebellum, fill it with chopped meat, like stuffed peppers
Cinder black sent with scimitars [?]
You sell Satan, carry the same pain as Larry Davis
Same gimmick, as Larry David, imagine the hatred
The relation of shell cases when I splatter your face
Is incinerates in the projects and smolders all in the basements

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I ain't got the patience, B
I'll deal with you another time
I'm the king of Perico, you're smaller than a fucking dime
Think any different, you must be out your motherfucking mind
I must have punched a bunch of faggot fucks like you a hundred times
.260 Remington is made for the precision
I rap with my hand around my dick like I was pissing
Poppy like you [?] cooking in the kitchen
The world is still the same but I'm just looking at it different
You stupid if you think somebody listening here
I'm like Marcus Peters locked arms, fist in the air (fist in the air)
Pop this crown, I split it in half like it's a [?]
Body bag duffle, I'll be muscling like Schwarzenegger
Your whole squad full of dummies like a strip club
Mike McCallum's body work, hit him till he piss blood
Count the number on the beat 666 cause
The black hills bark and they bite like a pit does

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
Yo, you a slave to your smartphone
Triple six, like dark throne
Every man, woman and child shall have a barcode
Rituals of fire inscribed in charcoal
Modern 85, I'm occupied by squad goals
Soldiers that spray the heater couldn't picture a miss
In front of the pharaoh, make his sword slither and hiss
You don't believe in God but I'll prove that Lucifer exists
Leave your wife like Leatherface with hooks through her tits
[?] I'll send four horsemen to clip you
Grew up in Glenwood Projects, homie, ofcourse it's official
You lack the minerals and vitamins, ions and the niacin
I exist like the Leviathan
Iron fist in a lion skin
Within a violent empire, riots sirens and fire
Wireless virus in an eye of a liar
Wearing a straight jacket like Eddie on the cover of Piece of Mind
Chain me to a padded wall and punish me for every crime
Every thought unify the heresy and let's be blind
Suicidal Tendencies tell me every time
Goons is deep, black hebrews is rocking spice like Rob Halford from Judas Priest
Who's the true of living god and who's the beast?

[Hook x4]
