[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
I seen my worst nightmares come true
Seen horrifying scenarios out my mind become realities truth
Have faith in nothing at all worship the Gods of Death
Seek bloodshed ya (?) murder until my dying breath

[Verse 2: Q-Unique]
So let’s inhale the Toxic Avenger
Squeeze the nickel play the trigger with the shot that’ll end ya
Call for a State of Emergency, gamma rays burning at third degree
Little children running off to play in the murder spree

[Verse 3: ILL Bill]
My words will be like murder movies slashing the She-Devil
Freddie Krueger vs Jason, trash and the speed metal
Thrashers with afros leather jackets and denim vests
Magnums and Tec's, Black Sabbath patches and meth

[Verse 4: Q-Unique]
A package of death as clear as blue crystal
I’m a savage distress and attack with two pistols
I’m an American Sniper that’s going American Psycho
Kept in an American cage like a freak in a sideshow

[Verse 5: ILL Bill]
Mind gone like a Satanist plotting a child’s sacrifice
Meet the grown-up version of child Anti-Christ
Listen here dear we triple-six like a stripper with her nipples pierced
Pistoleers (?) pistols whistle crystal clear

[Verse 6: Q-Unique]
But I’m distorted in sound recorded before you was found
Dismembered and slaughtered, tortured and tossed from the ground
The homies are odd and twisted Loki the God of Mischief
Learn the murder squad above the hood bombed the misfits
