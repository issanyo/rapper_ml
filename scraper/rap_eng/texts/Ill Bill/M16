[Hook]
Holding an M16
Holding an M16
Holding an M16
I’m extreme now
Bullet holes are left in people people
Bullet holes are left in people people

[Verse 1: Steven King]
I feel like this is Ronin, don’t know what’s in this case I’m holding
Is it an M16? Make my heart pump faster, it makes me want to squeeze
It’s the assassinator ?
Rain sparks cause we don’t ask for data
Want a shoulder to lean on? Not mine, head shot
Tripping like Activator
Play the low when I cock it
Stocking mask, we run up in the spot so we don’t get spotted
Red dot, you a target
I see you good like white lint on a black carpet
Bullets went through walls, niggas went to war
I know you’ve never heard it like this before
Come and get me, you gonna come with me
Hold the M16 like I get busy, it’s risky
Gotta move around, gotta keep your wrist strong
Shit you doing something right right? You living this long
So I shoot through the door, send you right to the morgue
That’s how real niggas do, nigga listen to the song

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
I grab the AR-15 updated and upgraded
M16, chop em up then duct tape them fuckfaces
Ice cold, squeeze the toast, leave em froze
Squeeze your toes, drag you into hellfire
Steal your soul, automatic steel explodes
Jesus no, I can see your brains peeking through a bleeding hole
Now your head is like a period, pussy with yeast ?
Discharge seeping low hemoglobin so horrifying and mortifying
The thought is dying and your entire life flash in front of your eyes
My M16 has touched hundreds of lives
Ain’t no silencer, ain’t no fucking surprise
Just fucking die, we buck then fly fucking fried
Let’s splatter this fucking guy
I like the HK416, I like MAC-11s, and Desert Es
But nothing’s like my M16
Night vision scope, grenade launcher, mechanism’s dope
Pick up your M16 and get prepared for the revolt
