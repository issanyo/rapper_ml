Intro (Big Left)
Yo What Up? It's the original Devil Dog Big Left of La Coka Nostra

(Uncle Howie)
Yo Big Left. This is Uncle Howie. Go fuck yourself, motherfucker!

Verse 1: (ILL BILL)
Ill Bill be the personification of modern day violence and hatred
A combination of science and nature designed to degrade you
And make you into something capable of surviving the Holocaust
Machinery, bitches, and weed be our power source
Blue and red rags, green money bags, black bitches with pink pussies
Colorful things, the hunger of kings, it inspires all in the kingdom
Y’all even murdered over oil wells and selling cracks in the wrong building
This is gangster music, goons and gangbangers with Uzis
Pimpin’,Penthouse pussy programmin' their coochies
Catch me in the back of the tour bus damaging groupies
Rock bitches only rap music they bang at The Fugees
I be deadly like coke and speed, heavily smoking weed
Uncle Howie screaming, “Rest in peace, ODB.”
We south paw, hit you hard with hammers
Big Left, Ill rock records, let’s bomb these faggots!

Hook X2
Ill Bill, Big Left
We supposed to be ferocious, real shit
Ill Bill, Big Left
Too much flavor I'm major, Bill
Verse 2: (Big Left)

Give me a bomb-ass chick and i"ll fuckin' dig out her organs
Big Left and Ill Bill and I ain’t talking about Baldwin
The Bronx and Canarsie, Starsky and Hutch
Quick to ride on you fucks without touching the clutch
Listen, I’ll run a train on a bitch with no intermission
My intuition tells me I need me some intervention
Fuck that shit, I’ll drink till my liver pops
Smoke a stog, drunk driving hoping I end up on Cops
An Italian Charles Bronson, slick with a death wish
Forty-four death kiss, like fuck it just let the lead spit
A bad motherfucker, white motherfucker
Quick to fight motherfuckers, take your life, motherfucker!
Live on the block where the pistols pop and the missiles drop
Corner store slinging weed out in crops
Got the lead out the box, sticking chickens like cops
Collaborate Uncle Howie, ‘05 at the top

[Chorus x 2]

[Uncle Howie talking]

Yo, Big Left. This is Uncle Howie and Ill Bill and we’re here to get high, man. Let’s do this
