[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
I spoke to Osama's cousin
He said that Jeb Bush was waiting with the helicopter
Blooded out, the Crips got Barry O at the teleprompter
Warlords argue over who brew the better vodka
Death is constant, value of life's less than nonsense
Process this information for me
Suck it through the barcode implanted in your face for free
You're just a Broken Arrow, homie, I'm a mushroom cloud
A walking suitcase nuke with a fuck you smile
Coked out hoes, sold out shows in Poland
Polo P-wings and Stadium hoodies, it's an explosion
Of the skull and guns, mafia meetings
FIB tags on belt parkway graffiti
The top of your face bleeding
What you reaching for?
Get your fucking hand out your pocket
And tell your man to stop acting so pompous
You in the mosh pit, pay attention, big brother is watching
Matter fact so are all of y'all
My YouTube channel is bonkers

[Chorus: ILL Bill]
This is ILL BILL TV - Goons on the scene
Shooters with cream - You glued to the screen

[Verse 2: ILL Bill]
We could watch the twin towers evaporate, obliterate, incinerate
Or watch this big titty bitch dictate, I spit hate, spit love
I spit drugs, I innovate, I make digital transistors integrate
The eagle, the owl and the octopus
Secrets that are worth dying for
Symbolism debatable like existence of dinosaurs
Final Call, witnesses of Jehovah spy in your door
Viral war, pyramid occupied by the eye of the storm
Campus rampage, suicide high school
Typhoon of firebombs, tsunami of firearms
A monsoon of multinational corporate chirons and icons
My logo might as well be a planet strangled by pythons
Or better yet a skull with double guns, muthafucker run
Left the undercover, drugged him with a needle from my brother Muggs
We make the music that your mother loves
Now she glued to the screen too, it's kinda bugged

[Chorus]
