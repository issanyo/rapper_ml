[Verse 1: Ill Bill]

I got the bandana over my face
So it’s impossible to identify the father of atrocity
Modern day Agathocles, use modern machines
Topple regimes, we conquerors from Compton to Queens
We build and destroy, tearing this shit apart from the seams
I seen it with my own eyes, I know it’s hard to believe
Till you see yourself starting to bleed
Till you see Moses standing on the edge of a cliff parting a sea
Now we watch the severed head of the Statue of Liberty
Being thrown down on the streets of Manhattan literally
Better yet the head of Daniel Pearl, welcome to a brand new world
NWO new edition like candy girl
My uncle spent New Year’s Eve 2008
On Rikers Island half-asleep with a shank
One eye wide open like the CBS logo
With multinational corporate criminals with Polo fits

[Hook]

Heavy metal correct you
We be causing a mosh pit like Cro-Mags at L’amours
Heavy metal correct you
We be causing a mosh pit like Cro-Mags at L’amours
Heavy metal correct you
We be causing a mosh pit like Cro-Mags at L’amours
Heavy metal correct you
We be causing a mosh pit like Cro-Mags at L’amours

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]

I’m the Van Allen radiation belt, I’m the thunder clapper
They call me Kenneth Bianchi from what I’ve done to rappers
Spiritual difference between the son and master
This the genesis, I only just begun the chapter
Russian AK’s, Pana with the polo on
I was rocking that in ‘88 before your solo song
Do whatever the fuck I want, I know it’s wrong
Call me the proper name of God like Jehovah’s mom
Y’all motherfuckers got guns, we got an arsenal
Mao said to read too many books is harmful
Mind is from Harvard, my heart is blacker than charcoal
Hold the pen so tight damage my metacarpals
Y’all should take mescaline tabs, I think it’s sound advice
I’m the molecular biology of paradise
I am Satanist, I am Buddha, and I am Christ
I’m Cus D’Amato in ‘84, I’m Iron Mike

[Hook]

Heavy metal correct you
We be causing a mosh pit like Cro-Mags at L’amours
Heavy metal correct you
We be causing a mosh pit like Cro-Mags at L’amours
Heavy metal correct you
We be causing a mosh pit like Cro-Mags at L’amours
So who you think this?
The Heavy Metal King
