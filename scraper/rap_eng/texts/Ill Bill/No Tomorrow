[Intro: Goretex]
Yo, you dealing with militant goons, ya know what I'm sayin?
Necro on the track, peace and love to BK
Far Rock, drop it

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
I stash concealables under my underoos, fuck them other crews
I got a hundred goons busting you with puncture wounds
Nothing but rage, nineteen ninety nine the world change
Now it seem, the devil leaves the righteous man slain
With the brain function, weak and calling
Reproduction, revolution, assassination, execution, collision
It's best to find my religious credential politicians
Devil's decisions populate prisons
Resisting arrest, officer investigate my place
Industrial strength flashlight, bash me in my face
These police they, motivate, drug market maneuvers
Gat shooters, visionary military computer operation specialist
My intelligence breeds benevolence
Subtract infested cam of the inheritance
No evidence, gunshots like three blast
Dippin' out the back with the jet-black ski mask
Can't identify, who he? You can't see
Jumble the visibility, we camouflage to crimes be
My mind be, venturing into territories
Eighteen hundred and twenty five days end of story

[Hook]
Everywhere I go 5-0 wanna follow
Everytime I flow it's like there's no tomorrow
I can bring happiness or I can bring sorrow
You don't wanna mess around there's no tomorrow
(2x)

[Verse 2: Goretex]
It's Abraham baggin' grams on a beach in France
Militia dancer my Tony Cicero stance exaggerated
And overblow grimace like the technique of Sugar Ray's left hook
Born to menace, Mahatma Christ, bootless bandits on the streets
Bless beats with treats strictly prime meats, for all my peeps
Non-Phixion, incredible goons bringing the legacy
Shit, realer than actresses rocking double mastectomies
I represent like Canarsie Artie
Quick to stick a party, intoxicated from Bacardi
Real shit, legit like pigs who carry biscuits
Intrinsic, like your collar mined he owed for brisket
Don't risk it, like Mumia before a caper
Upstate lats get buried, on two point five acres
A crook with line plus my alibi designed to jerk
Housing officials and feds looking for Tec-9s
I been through more shit than Rocky Dennis
Or Craig Mack's blemish, MC's suck mine and then replenish
Back in Iceland we handy with the gadgets
Crime-ridden like Jared extortion karats on Sabbath
Keep it rugged like Tommy
Waco will play your devastation
And sixty X's for my nation

Hook (2x)
