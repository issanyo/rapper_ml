[Intro]
We just started making monsters and just making just weird and horrible monsters while designing a lot of the work we really tried to depart as far as we could from what you've seen before

[Hook]
We live today like we dying tonight
It’s time to get live
We live today like we dying tonight
So?! So?! So?! So?! So?! So?!
We live today like we dying tonight
It's time to get live
We live today like we dying tonight

[Verse 1: Adlib]
[?], got a mouth full of gold
Smile in your pic, I look like destro













[Hook]
We live today like we dying tonight
It's time to get live
We live today like we dying tonight
So?! So?! So?! So?! So?! So?!
We live today like we dying tonight
It’s time to get live
We live today like we dying tonight

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
My heart is blacker than the helmet of Darth Vader, I stomp haters
Fuck the moon, I clock you to Mars like Carl Sagan
Yeah I shot Reagan, but fuck that faggot that shot Biggie
I spit verbal milk like your mom's titty
And my city's the king's county, top of the food chain
Spit proudly, killas in the streets since Howie
Sentences fly in this treacherous grind, vengeance is mine
[?] as expensive as mine
Fuck you, pay me, it's [?]
Drag you to hell like Sam Raimi
You can't stop me, can't fade me, can't play me
You can’t handle me, you can’t take me
Better off jumping off the top of a skyscraper screaming "Save me"
Listen to the voice inside telling you to flee
Ignore the voices inside telling you that you compare to me
I set fires like an arsonist with gasoline
[?] death [?] apocalypse [?]

[Hook]
We live today like we dying tonight
It's time to get live
We live today like we dying tonight
So?! So?! So?! So?! So?! So?!
We live today like we dying tonight
It’s time to get live
We live today like we dying tonight

[Verse 3: Adlib]
I live today like I'm dying tonight
Non-stop green light, fuck being polite















[Hook]
We live today like we dying tonight
It's time to get live
We live today like we dying tonight
So?! So?! So?! So?! So?! So?!
We live today like we dying tonight
It's time to get live
We live today like we dying tonight
