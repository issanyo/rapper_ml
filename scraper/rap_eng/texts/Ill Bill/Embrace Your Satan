[Intro]
What? Costumed assassins, in the heart of New York, and no one even notices? Has the city gone mad?

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Sorcerer beard, doom metal soundtracks
The officer bewared shoot up with they moms at
Embrace your Satan
Take it back to when John Hinckley sprayed up Reagan

[Verse 2: Goretex]
Hey yo my bathtub ghetto work out decompose mucus
Sit bank Hank with ten to twelve in the casket like Frank Lucas
Shank Judas cause yo the Torah be the holy sect
All you bags of suppliers  you got pussy like Richard Speck

[Hook: ILL Bill]
Blood splattered sunglasses, guns blasted, dust, ashes
Funerals and young caskets, baby gangsters, dumb bastards
Live fast run past us
Smile now cry after assassin’s shoot up what you love with a smile laughing

[Verse 3: Goretex]
Medina frozen nose like dope from Peking
Get your neck sawed off with a broken blade like Jay Sebring
Post-mortem I hit ‘em with ice trays ‘til the body’s frozen
A thousand sleeps without war I got my lobby open

[Verse 4: ILL Bill]
That crazy heady rap angel dust and the hourglass
The blowjobs from seventy-two virgins like Taliban
Action packed acid rap's backs like a savage
When the ratchet clap barrels blast to pierce you like a arrow shaft

[Verse 5: Goretex]
The mac is greater
Laugh when you go down like a sack of potatoes
Shook a steel cage ’82 when he pulled the tazer
Smile now die later, 700 horse power
'81 Trans-Am, they makin’ punches for the horse powder

[Hook: ILL Bill]

[Outro]
No, no, no, not yet, not yet, don't pass out on me yet!
You rotten wanker ! Do we understand each other?
If you care what happens to the girl you better answer me, all right? Now listen to me carefully... I..-I've changed my mind, I'm going to let her die! I just wanted you to know that
