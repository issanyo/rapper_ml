[Intro: 'Signs' sample]
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed
By a 42 year old, Romero Valadares
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday
In the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil
It was sent to the local news bureau there
And sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago
All initial opinions are, this is genuine
What you're about to see, may disturb you

[Verse: ILL Bill]
Murder forensicles surrounded by alternative tentacles
Extraterrestrials step out of starships in pressure suits
Claiming humans were created inside of test tubes
Horrifyingly huge eye sockets resemble head wounds
Pumping the protoplasm, jelly like substance
Looking like Goldblum in The Fly but more dusted
Don't trust their reptilian tongue
They come in peace is what they claim
When their true intentions are to have the world in chains
Enslaved, they came from beyond the stars, unexplainable
Religious people thought their coming was a sign from God
They thought these were the Elohim
When the first mothership arrived over the planet
It was a creepy scene
A huge hovering metal structure stretching
For over 5 miles every direction, blocking perception
Every news channel, 24 hour coverage, stopping commercials
Doctors, experts, UFOs, crop circles
Arguing generals in closed door meetings
Religious cults claiming to know the meaning of these beings
Many of these cults claimed to have been abducted, probe prodded
And fist fucked and caught in the tracker beam and lifted up
Into the lab, strapped to a table, made to endure a series of tests Pushing beyond the limits of stress
Waking up in a cornfield naked, barely alive
Every inch of your body's in pain, you barely survived
Millenniums ago, star maps were drawn in sand
The meaning of the pyramids has long tortured man
Pharaohs and Hebrews, Mayans and Aztecs
Mathematically perfect architects that many gods have blessed
Hieroglyphics become the blueprint of primal physics
Pyramids buried kings, queens, tribal clerics
Radar signals from space bouncing off burnt rock
