[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Yo, a close encounter of the Fourth Kind
Alien abductions, suction cups, puncture and fuck
Rape, rupture and suck, clusters of pumps
Constant transfusions suction the puss
Lucid autopsies that dwarf Nazis, functions erupt
Cold War between the Devil and does God exist?
No Geneva Convention politics
Just tractor beams and Elohim father ships
Ever since they discovered 51
Taking ten of us for every one of them
Some are never heard from again
Some return retarded, others programmed with propaganda
Honored doctors find most of their orifices tampered and soldered
Vital organs randomly removed, replaced by those of animals
In some rare cases diseases like AIDS and cancer are cured
The planet’s still doomed, modern man is a fool
They plan to hit the ship floating over Iran with a nuke
After 2012 came and passed the motherships arrived
In 2013 and publicly entered the world scene
I talked about this ten years ago on Non Phixion songs
Now strapped onto a table being operated on
By numerous species of various extraterrestrial feces
Transcending beyond existing theses
No anesthesia screaming “Please kill me, read me Revelation 7:17”
The Lamb of God shall be the shepherd of the throne of Elohim
Why did you piss them off? Primitive and coarse
Reverse-engineering built those space shuttles lifting off
Stolen recipes, stealth weaponry, stop rivals
Alien fibers that resemble the mind of H.R. Giger
Like a Dr. York R&B ballad
Unexplainable like two planes colliding with three towers
