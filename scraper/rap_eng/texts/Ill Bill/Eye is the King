[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
My fist is a gun, my fingers is individual pistols
System overload, glitches toe to toe, eye to eye, soul to soul
Walk amongst the lords of war, soldier gore
Calls these invisible walls to fall
Mental slavery, skids a metal prison corridor, cult leader orator
Since I was a shorty y’all busy with the .44
The black flag represent the skull and the guns
It’s like selling a MAC-11 to Attila the Hun
The ultimate in cult leaders, adult folk villains
Coke dealings in the champagne room with broke feeling
So fake amongst plastic piranhas
I’mma put you all to sleep in some acid pyjamas
Central intelligence odyssey, mind control biography
MK-Ultra, extraterrestrial sodomy
Way beyond astronomy, double-O like Sean Connery
We walk silently with big silencers violently

[Hook x2]
Everything William Cooper was talking about then is happening now
Malachi York was way ahead of his time too, it’s wild
"In the land of the blind the man with one eye is the king"

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
My fist is a gun, every finger’s an individual sword
You either living with Shaytan or you living with God
I make metal with the cult leader orator
Since I was shorty y’all busy with Bacardi raw
I cock the .44, symphonies by Marley Marl
I would splatter all of y’all, shit y’all never saw before
Vinnie and his dogs of war, bombs the size of soccer balls
Since y’all was inside the walls tortured with the waterboards
Grab him by his throat, take his fucking head and scalp him
I carry black metal like I’m Venom’s second album
Support Dr. York, don’t believe what’s said about him
Strangle non-believers till the fucking redness out him
If we don’t like what they saying I guess we have to drown em
All they see is the demon lord and death around em
I’m made of mercury alloy like I was in amalgam
No matter how you look at it cousin death is the outcome

[Hook x2]
