[Verse 1 Ill Bill]
Every society honors it's live conformists and dead trouble makers
I'm the Son of Satan, sculpted the culture of the ancients
Burn me at the stake with my left hand stuck in the Matrix
I'm the apex, I steal science offa spaceships
Black water contractors captured off a camcorder
After Mass slaughter, violent massacre, Masters of Order
Burning effigies of presidents and American flags
Veterans clash for the chance to sell terror for cash
Babylon destroyed the base of mikdash
Death cults, murder squads, exploded churches and burning mosques
Throw your dice now you destiny's cashed
And they seize a war with planet over centuries past
And the mysteries remain unsolved, colossal pyramids on Mars
Visitors beyond the scriptures of Allah
God is on the side of the ones with money and large armies
Pray for death of these brainwashed zombies, 'Society Is Brainwashed'

[Hook]
I bet you can't see what i can see
Thats right theres a few things we have to adress
I bet you can't see what i can see
When im in the streets i always remain cautious
Its good, god damn


[Verse 2 Ill Bill]
November 5th, 2001, less than two months after 9/11 occurred
The infamous William Cooper was murdered
Ex Naval Intelligence Officer, but now author of Behold A Pale Horse
He paid the cost
I can't say I agree with everything that he wrote
But admired him for speaking his mind though
Never holding his tongue for nobody, your 'Society Is Brainwashed'
Guns in each others faces for the same lies
Same everything and same nothing
Same bullshit materialist of the Third World man's luxury
This false flag fuckery, an AIDS infested junky
Your Lady of Liberty can't fuck me
Can't touch me, the black pope superior general
Tim Osman riding like a Piru from Inglewood
Bring the hood up to a hovering mother ship
They already made the switch to the One World Government

[Verse 3 Ill Bill]
Amongst the Ivory Tower witch doctors, when this explosion
On the groom lake landing strip silicon, sorcerers abandoned ship
Famine gripped the planet with the gigantic Satanic fist
Believed to be linked to Al-Qaeda through a sandwich business
I dont advise you to believe these could be camera tricks
All I'm sayin is to ask questions amateurs
What Hollywood tries to pass off as fantasy
Might already have happened in actuality
And vice versa, if Jesus Christ was a person, who was Mithra? Who was Krishna?
Who was the first to be baptized, crucified, resurrected
Betrayed and made into a martyr for someone else's redemption?
Old men start wars for young dudes to die in
Madison avenue tellin you what you should be buyin
Religion and science always profess peace
But in the end who created the deadly war machine Society is...
