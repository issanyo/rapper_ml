[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]

Y’all should stop rhyming
I’m a G, hardbody, I am not common
This is destiny, it’s not luck, it’s not timing
And Vinnie staying in the hood like he Top Ramen
I ain’t ready for the stage until my fourth quart
I’m the definition of bully, a poor sport
However you want it, we can do it on your court
My sword’ll cut your shit in half like it’s divorce court
I have G in my blood cause my pops had it
The straight left hits hard like it’s Scott Travis
I don’t fuck with anybody who is not savage
The GSG-5 leave your block ravished
I’m not sick, I control the disease
I got Lamas but not the ones that Napoleon feeds
Even the most protected soldier could bleed
Me and you ain’t nothing alike, we a whole different breed

[Hook: Ill Bill]

Yo, sawed-off or automatic, my aura cause static
Traumatic anarchy volcanic is organic
Heavy metal emperors, kings on the planet
Bring whores and Xanax, think more satanic

X pills, Vicodins, OCs, powder
Haze, OG kush, diesel and sour
Dust, chews, lucies, turbans, and kufis
Handguns, rocket launchers, shotguns, and UZIs

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]

Imported Italian leather sofas Valencia
Shooters imported from Chechnya
Put em underneath the dirt with the rest of ya
The skull and crown on the sword, four pound on ya boy
Cause entire crowds to applaud, ten thousand or more
Can never be contained, lyrically deranged, clinically insane
Critically acclaimed, I keep the industry afraid
They’ve been super nervous ever since we escaped
Goons with burners, destiny betrayed, refuse to lose or ever be a slave
A picture’s worth a thousand words but a symbol is worth a thousand pictures
We never fully understood the symbol found in scriptures
Swastikas spray-painted on the pyramids
Sometimes I feel like we’re just an experiment
Gold fronted up top to bottoms, cock the llamas
Mossad, Osama, jihad, Obama, call me the Skull Head
Like Four Horsemen combined in one warhead
You fuck around I’ll detonate and leave you all dead

[Hook: Ill Bill]
