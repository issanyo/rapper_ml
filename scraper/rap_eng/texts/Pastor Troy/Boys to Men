[Pastor Troy Talking]
Ayo this ya boy Pastor Troy checkin in right here, yeah
(This from the soul)

Ayo on this joint right here man we b0ut to just break it down to you
Man just the transition to becoming... (This from the heart)
That some of yall gone have to go through man everyb0dy on the sound
Of my voice (This from the soul)
Everything gone be cool man, From Boys to Men

[Verse 1]
No one to doubt me, I'm not here lonely
Childhood secrets still with my homies
I recall days where we blazed up on the hill
Not knowing what the future would hold, just kept it real
We ridin on the lac wit the boys to other schools
We catch'em at they football game and act a fool
And everyb0dy know my name, that's Michael Troy
We made all them bullies respect Falcon boy
I got my folks worried, I'm suspended everyday
Sometimes I ain't tell'em and caught the train to the A
To the firepoint station supremal location (C'mon, Cmon)
I'm only 15, tho at the lil scene

[Chorus]
No one to pry me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
He'd shelter from the rain to ease the pain
Changing from boys to men

[Verse 2]
I done seen stabbins, I done seen shootins
I done seen a robbery, I done seen two
But I ain't even 15
So when I turn 16 I'ma get that chrome thing wit the beam
My team was the 'wrecking crew' like juice
The type of niggas on our side do  what's the truth
I bet them killas on yo side respect game
That other nigga from the southside was lame
My name is stone, Charles Town to the bone
Lil wayne and scooby rockin MCM and gucci
I'm 9 years old the nigga let me touch a uzi
I wanted to kill just like I saw up in the movie
No wonder my friend shot his self in the head
Playing with the gun from under his mother's bed
Don't wanna call his name too tough, we'll call'em "fred"
We watch my nigga wally bled when we was young!

[Chorus]
No one to pry me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
He'd shelter from the rain to ease the pain
Changing from boys to men

[Chip]
Yeah, yeah, it's in our heart..
Lord knows we be trying hard god watchin over us
Momma told me "baby don't be going to school cuttin up"
Did I listen? Hell naw
Listen lemme tell yall
Youth transformed mommas only into eightball
Everywhere I go niggas know I speak that poetry
Sing my Chilouette like Alfred Hitchcock and they know it's me
Down the line, met a lot of niggas on the grind
Hit plenty dimes
Murder they asses make it seem like I commit the crime
A friend of mine, won't rap into illegal business
18 wheelers, fed X and brickes did with killas
He smoked and dipped'em drunk wit chrysey
(?)
Them bitches down though, come straight back afta they get through strippin
I'm out of town, Nextel jerkin it's his lil brother cryin
Told me his brother killed hisself, I say nigga you lyin
He put the gun in his mouth and blew his brains 0ut
He couldn't handle (?) this shit we sang b0ut

[Chorus]
No one to pry me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
He'd shelter from the rain to ease the pain
Changing from boys to men..
