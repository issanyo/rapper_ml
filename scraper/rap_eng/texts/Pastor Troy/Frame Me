[Pastor Troy]

Verse 1:

It was this muthafucker hi' about the got damn N.A.R.C.'s
To see how quick to get the ki in college park
I knew him from the shop, knew he was full of shit
Wiped that nigga half a block, charge a whole brick
I got him thinking well shit I'll git dat money back
Got a surprise for his ass, hell naw jack, I got to go
I cut the corner by the store when they first got on my ass
Carrying all my damn dope, so I got to be fast
I'm looking mad as a muthafucker stooped down low
And I'm a kill me a muthafucker, I can't go
Cause hell no, that 44 is tapping my side
Telling me to turn around on these bitches and fry
And see I never should've served that nigga
I'll make it my business to murder that nigga
You see I, I shouldn't of served that nigga
I'll make it my business to murder that nigga

Hook: In background (You fucked up when he see my ass again)

A frame me, frame me, you gone die bitch
(Recite 8x)

Verse 2:

I cut between this green house and this blue muthafucker
Still touting my money, I'm headed back towards my brother
On tha other street, pulled my heat, released three
They may catch some, but they will never catch me
And with this nigga half of ki, I'm running faster than ever
S squads and the N.A.R.C.'s, but they got to come better
Got my pistol in my left hand, my money in right
These niggas fucking with a made man and shots take flight
I think they might try to cut me off on Pecan Drive
Make a left, then a right, hold my breath and hide
Then go aside of this old house and change my clothes
Trying to find a safe place where I can hide my dope
I'm creeping up out the do', slip of my grinding suit
I reload the 44, now I'm ready to shot
I took the money to the back, cut the shit in the sofa
Look some snitches like that, so I tipped it over
Now I'm smiling like the Joker on the brink of a laugh
Now I got to find this nigga that tried to act
Cause see I, never should've served that nigga
I'll make it my business to murder that nigga

Verse 3:

I stepped back out in the darker suit, threw on my skully
Know tha N.A.R.C. 's some where mad as hell, looking bout ugly
But they can't touch me, I know what they gone do before it's done
Now they advise that young muthafucker to run
Cause when I come, I'm coming with tha work
All you hear is gun shots, you see a nigga hurt
He shouldn't of fucked with me
Living out lucky, he playing it smart
Don't show yo face, in College Park
It's getting dark, so I sparked, cause I ain't smoked all day
Where ever that muthafucker hiding, his ass better stay
Cause I don't play muthafucker, let's get that straight now
Muthafuckers will do what muthafuckers allow
But I'm like blaow, how the hell am I going under
Caught him cutting the corner, I filled him up with the thunder
Made him wonder was it worth it, put four in his heart
Don't start that shit in College Park
I ripped his chest apart and shot that bitch walking with him
Then I went and called a ambulance to come and get 'em
Had to hit 'em, to show 'em I'm a real muthafucker
I grabbed my money and hit 20 it's to Augusta

I never should've of served that nigga
I made it my business to murder that nigga
You see I shouldn't of served that nigga
I'll made it my business to murder that nigga

A frame me, frame me, you gone die bitch
