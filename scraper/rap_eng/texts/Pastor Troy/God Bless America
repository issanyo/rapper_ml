[Chorus] (repeat 4x)
I am a real American
Fight for the rights of every man

When it rain it pours, thunder and lightning
These cowards is trifling
They got me, watching for high jackers
Watching for terrorism, bet I ain't playin with 'em
The nine get 'em
It's horror when you don't know if you gone ever see tomorrow
Or your partner, maybe a loved one, maybe your auntie
Think you gone take from me, well then it's on g
Jesus is coming back, soon as he lay attack
I bust my rifle, I'll wave my bible
Crankin' my army up because we know what' up
They hit pentagon and now it's Babylon
Bless America

[Chorus] (repeat 4x)

America, no country like it
America, let's get united

We all fightin
A couple cases of anthrax
Though I ain't sweatin
Me and my homies got army gadgets
No it ain't magic
You bomb me, I bomb you
This is a ???
Pastor sucka, U.S Marines, Army, Navy on the same team
It's not a dream, its reality
Miseducated,  to all casualty
You capture me, I'mma be dumpin something
I'm from America buddy you better tell him something
Usama Bin Laden, we see you, we blasting
Buddy we want you, dead or alive
And when we catch you, got a surprise
Fuck the Taliban, fuck the marathon
Sucka, fuck everything, and just let freedom ring
Bless America

[Chorus] (repeat until song ends)
