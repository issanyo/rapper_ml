We choppin heads, ain't scared to kill niggas
For real nigga, slow it down and we'll be fine

Your soul is mine, you pursuing my wicked thoughts
And the way you move and the slick shit that you talk

And you will see better days they shall come
And if they don't get yo gun and drop bombs

Ain't got no time for no fake muthafuckers
Bitch say ya grace, this the last fucking supper

Fresh out the womb till they nail me to the cross
Done took a lost, so you know my mindframe

On everythang I ever loved reppin thugs

Now haters, just admit my perfection
And keep yo Smith & Wesson
