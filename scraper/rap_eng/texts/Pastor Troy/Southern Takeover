The Sound of Revenge
Haha whoo
Tell 'em what it is man Tell 'em what it is
(Welcome to the new world order
Atlanta, Georgia)
Houston, Texas
The South is officially taking over
Y'all already know

[Hook: Chamillionaire] + (Killer Mike)
Just look over your shoulders, shoulders
Let me see who just showed up, showed up
It's the southern takeover, its over
Better tell 'em
(I got dreams to stand on top
Try and stop, blot blot block)
Just look over your shoulders, shoulders
Let me see who just showed up, showed up
It's the southern takeover, its over
Better tell 'em
(I got dreams to stand on top
Try and stop, blot blot block)

[Killer Mike]
It's the mister four-fifth toter
Cooking coke with baking soda
Dub roller, pro smoker, wood gripper, pistol whipper
Muck a nigga if he figure fucking with my figures makes him richer
He should know instead that it will make him deader
That remind me, fucking with my money
Get yo money snatched right out of Sunday School
On a bright and sunny Sunday, this ain't funny
I ain't joking bout my coke and package come up shorter
Might kidnap your wife and daughter
Bury them down deep in Georgia
No D.A. or fucking lawyer prosecuting
Witnesses we executing, start the shooting, start the looting
Start the violence, start a riot
Get this motherfucker crunker, crunk you can get it
Pass that dro, I'mma hit it
Out of line, nigga I spit it
Spit it vivid, cause I live it
You don't walk it, you just talk it
Pistol toting and unloading, that's my slogan, 'bout this dope and
I ain't holdin, steady slangin', right on your trap or block
Take your trap, set up shop
Try and stop, blot! blot! blot!

[Chamillionaire]
This ain't about a image, this ain't about a gimmick
Pussy stand to the side now the game gotta meanace
I'm damn said to the city I came to stop the realest
We bombing on his ass when he's finishing his sentence
I've only got a minute if it ain't about a digit
You looking at a nigga like I ain't about to get it
I'm looking at the money like I ain't about to finish
So you need to mind your business if you ain't bout your business
Uh, I'm a H-Town Soldier, I'mma come
With the trunk up, and gon remind cha
If you say your getting it, shoulda told chu bout a
Nigga named Chamillionaire that's fo sho a problem
You don't want no problem, probably gonna need you to let the fo-fo remind 'em
Yeah you tip on and ride em, We ride 4-4s when the dough beside 'em
6'6 taller looking like he a center, 10 tattoos looking like he a killer
Skinny ass niggas don't fight with a nigga, Pull out a billboard, put a price on a nigga
Have his kinfolk, put a knife in a nigga
From the car to the pocket then hit him right in your liver
It was a big boy to put a slice in the middle, your head fast nigga Killer Mike with the killer
Don't mess with the south, homie that's a dream, hallucinating or imagining
We so XXL with the gats I mean, something ready to blow in the magazine
You know that them southern cash is mean, franklins frown for me when I stash my cream
Pull up with the candy paint that'll match my green, Killer Pastor, they just ain't imagining

[Hook]

[Pastor Troy]
Y'all know me its PT, well uh huh and all of that
Black on black with black tip, I can't help but represent
Not content I want more who the fuck you take me for
Studio rappers not my forte, drop my top and bust my ak
No more play in G-A, yeah that's a classic
Riding in the classic, totin me a plastic
Send 'em to the casket, send 'em to the morgue
Slap me a nigga cause I'm motherfucking bored
Chamillionaire, I camoflauge with my surroundings
Get my Desert Eagle and get to motherfucking pounding
Up and down the street, throwing heat out the driver seat
Riding to the beat, tell them niggas its just they week

[Hook]
