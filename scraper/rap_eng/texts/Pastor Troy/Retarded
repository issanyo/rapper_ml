[Chorus]
Y'all niggeas see what you started?
F**king ass retarded
You wreck sh*t with that chopper
You wreck wholes, I got them
All yo niggas on the f**king floor
It's 'bout the money
Now put it up in the band
Got 100 grand cuffa
I n anybody back
Please don't be no hero
My dollar is zero
Acting to see 100
Y'all niggas know who run it
Cut the motherf**kers
Me and my brothers
Ask the situation
Break up the nation
Let's clear up the safe
Pistol in it's face
Shoot 'em off the top
Pop, b**ch, I'm off the clock
Sirens outside
Someone gotta ride
But before I leave
Mah'duck Jay-Z

[Chorus]
