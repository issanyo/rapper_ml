Verse 1:

Niggas throwing boes
Firing up dem dubs
Everybody cool
Chilling in the club
Smoking on some what
Got me on lean
I be in the cut
Blowing mad green
Flexing at the bar
Dubs on my car
Limousine chauffeur
Face in magazines
Pull up on the scene
Cause I'm riding clean
Might be in a Jag
Might be in a Benz
Might be in a Chevy with some duels ack a ass ack a ass
Quick to pop a slug at a nigga
Take a plug out a nigga
Got a nigga ??? dome
Dirty South affiliated niggas tout tones
Them there make a nigga get gone
Niggas throwing boes trying to get up in the do'
