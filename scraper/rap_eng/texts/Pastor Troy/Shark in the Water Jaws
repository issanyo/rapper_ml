[Verse 1]
I'm the shark in the water
??? Quick bite
Pussy ass niggas its gonna be a long night
Pastor you see me swimming in a circle
Praying on a nigga straight laying on a nigga
Catch a nigga surfing
Pussy nigga we murkin
Bite the boat in half
Then a gangsta laugh
When you see my teeth
When you see my fins
You gonna know you ????
I ain't got no friends
Eat the motherfucker from Atlanta to Augusta
Catch him in Savannah and I drag his ass to Russia
Shark S.H.A.R.K I patrol the ocean nigga I do not play
Bite yo son and eat your daughter
Better watch out there's a shark in the water
His name pastor call me jaws

[Chorus]

Call me jaws nigga
You better call the laws nigga
I'm the shark in the water
Call me jaws nigga
You better call the laws nigga

[Verse 2]
Better bring your harpoon better bring your net
I'm tired of y'all pussy niggas swimming round my set
Nigga I smell blood you will get drug
I do it for my niggas and I do it for my thugs
I'm the shark you better know
Use that fin you better go
I'ma be lurking from side to side
Don't give a fuck bout no homicide
I'ma be biting and shaking the waves
This shit right here for the niggas who be hating
Only thing I do is come at heart
Better stay your ass up out the water
Bitch I'm the pastor the only one
I swim faster with a bomb
Catch a fuck nigga like megatron
Yeah we catch em like megatron
Strapped with a tommy gun
You know I ain't really for this stupid shit
Go up and bite a bitch as soon as that chopper hits
Its pt nigga my teeth like razors
Tell them niggas shit just got major
Catch em while they on the beach
Why they think this shit is sweet
Snatch him in that water
Bring that nigga by his fucking feet
Weak ass niggas y'all gonna have to take a pause
For jaws

[Chorus]
I'm the shark in the water
Call me jaws nigga
You better call the laws nigga
I'm the shark in the water
Call me jaws nigga
You better call the laws nigga
I'm the shark in the water
Call me jaws nigga
You better call the laws nigga
I'm the shark in the water
Call me jaws nigga
You better call the laws nigga
