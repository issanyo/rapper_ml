Talkin' to the man, don't think he understands what I'm sayin'
Under the gun, all he says is "Son just keep on playin'"
Who do you trust - when you're out on the edge of losin'
Down to the bone - feelin' all alone, keep on movin'
You've been runnin' scared, sayin' life is fair - I ain't listenin'
Talk about your schemes, but I don't wanna be another victim
Who do you trust - when you're out on the edge of losin'
Down to the bone - feelin' all alone, keep on movin'

Chorus:
Keep on movin', don't stop movin'
It's gonna get better, better, Lord you know it just can't get much worse
Don't you think it's wise, to lose the thin disguise that you've been keepin'
Open up your eyes, you're spendin' all your life just breakin' even
Who do you trust - when you're out on the edge of losin'
Down to the bone - feelin' all alone, keep on movin'

(chorus)
Keep on movin', don't stop movin'
(Solo)

(chorus repeats out)
