Verse 4: T-Mac

At 16 I was hustling trying to get paid
Trying to make a damn dollar for I go in my grave
Pimp a been paid
I was only short in my days
The way I been paid
Only cause I'm ducking them feds
This world of crime
Kept me in the street trying to grind
Bumping my mind
Cause that's how the system designed
I'm sick of struggling
I'm sick of hustling
I'm sick of running from the feds trying to bust again
I'm trying to maintain
One foot stuck in the game
I'm living lavish man
I'm use to having thangs
But cause I'm down for whatever
Cause T-Mac show no luv
2 gats on my side
Cause this whole world dying
