[Pastor Troy]

I'm the muthafucking president (come on, come on) 3x
Watch how I represent

Verse 1:
From the land where the constitution stand while niggas stumbling
Wondering, who is gone step up and stop the mumbling?
We all complain for better things
But who gonna bring the pain to make these muthafuckers shame
They weigh
My brother taught me that crime pays
We run up in another nigga shit with a.k.'s and Mob thirds
Who gone have the last word?
Yo team or mine
Why don't we just rob them crackers blind
Quit being shine
My mind upsets me cause niggas a stress me
If yo ass don't wanna be set free
Don't hinder me
I can see it from a mile away
I hate these muthafuckers
But I love the game they play
Like they so innocent
I know them fucking crackers bent
Cause niggas bent too
Look at all I been through
And I'm still running
Grab yo gun and grab yo bullet proof
But do not come if you ain't gone put yo shit to use
Cause this a muthafucking war

Hook: 4x
Uncle Sam what's yo ransom
I got yo nieces
Please, don't make me blow these ho's to pieces
Cause they increasing

Verse 2:
Uncle Sam what's yo ransom
Tell me what's up
Got a message for the Pentagon
You fucking up
50 bucks and a canteen
Dogding the trap never will I join the army bitch!
Don't make me laugh
It's war
My niggas is burning and giving in
Either you roll with them or they throw you in the pin
To win, was all I ever wanted to do
Would you do it for me (No)
Then I can't do it for you
A soulja buddy, I was born on the base
Uncle Sam want who?, Get the fuck up out my face
The case is closed
I can't be treated like a ho
No push-ups, no sit-ups, I tell ya hell no
I been in the army 22 years to today
I rock my fatigues, I rock my muthafucking yay
I sweep on the bump and let it rid e on y'all punks
The streets my army and I been ready off the jump
Muthafuckers I'ma soulja
