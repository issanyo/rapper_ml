Verse 1: Pastor Troy

Sometimes I feel like I am stuck between a bad dream
Running this race thank the Lord for his amazing grace
Yes I believe, blessed wit G's that's around me
Forevermore a thug buddy you can't clown me, that's on the court
Give me war, strength and power daily
Lord bless my lady, don't let situations drive her crazy
Baby I know, everyday it's like I gots to go, never no time
Everything's gone be straight though, I'm on the grind
Love is blind, I can see it now
It's 20/20 from the 'Burban to the Benz now
A fifth of Remi, it ain't many that can maintain
But boo I love you cause I know that you can stand the game
Stand the game

Chorus: Co-Ed

Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me baby can you stand the game

Storms will come, this we know for sure
Tell me baby can you stand the game

Verse 2: Pastor Troy

Sometimes I wonder how did I become so lucky
A million hoes, now I got a gurl that loves me
It's kind of funny cause I never been the one for love
All I was thinking bout was money or selling drugs, that's what it was
Young rich nigga, hoes a dime a dozen
The older that I grew, I knew a ho ain't nothing
It's more than fucking that was high school shit
I moved my gurl in, it's me her and the pits
Six in the yard, I give thanks to God
For making it easy though they say it would be hard
And me and my gurl gone stack it up for a while
And when I wake up, first thing I see is her smile
And when she has my child I'll be the happiest on earth
And I'm a be there every second of it's birth
And it don't even matter, if it's a girl or it's a boy
Cause the last name is gone be Troy
Huh, the game

Chorus: Co-Ed

Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me baby can you stand the game

Storms will come, this we know for sure
Tell me baby can you stand the game

Verse 3: Pastor Troy

Sometimes I wonder do you miss me how I miss you
Can't wait to git back to the crib so I can kiss you
It crack me up because you could have been done gave it up
But you stay with me cause no matter what you give a fuck
Therefore we stuck-together like paste and glue, hey baby its me and you
Forever we made a vow, so we gots to do it now
I know you believe in me, just say what you wanna be
And we will have everything, if you can just stand the game

Chorus: Co-Ed

Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me baby can you stand the game

Storms will come, this we know for sure
Tell me baby can you stand the game
(Repeat)
