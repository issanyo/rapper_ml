[Intro]
Yeah (yeah)
This song here is called Goddamn, Vice Versa
(I'm doin' my best to save my people)
It's like, (The people and I will rely on God)
Picture everything that you thought was good, was really bad
Everything bad, was really good
(What if Heaven was on Earth nigga)
The whole world, vice versa
(Good is bad)
Vice versa (Bad is good)
(Hell on Earth nigga)
This shit here, Goddamn, go on
Go on and get you a mother fuckin' fat ass blunt of that 'dro
Smoke that shit
(It's all vice versa)
Look up in the air nigga
(We rich nigga)
(This is what we doin', it's vice versa)
I know all these real niggas gon' feel this shit
Vice Versa, Pastor Troy
(Vice Versa)

[Verse 1: Pastor Troy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What if Heaven was Hell and vice versa?
If I told you go to Hell, would you tell I cursed ya?
I reimbursed ya with the truth so you know my fate
And pray I die, I'm that nigga that they love to hate
I wanna make you use your mind, God has sent the sign
And when you listen to these rhymes, nigga take your time
Again I ask, Heaven was Hell and vice versa
Would you start doing evil in order to nurture the spirit man?
Do you understand that there's a war?
It's ragin' on and the devil got some ammo too
Don't get me wrong, but I put my trust off in the Lord
It's too corrupt, know that God gon' help me blow 'em up
I give a fuck, Heaven was Hell and vice versa, I have no fear
I done witnessed too much Hell right here, lend me your ear
Recall the beer we had to pour
For all our niggas, hit the Devil with the .44
Payback nigga!
My liquor keep me from tryin' to enter battle alone
And to deal with all this wickedness, I smoke a zone
Know I'm grown, but I'm still a baby
It's vica versa so I guess I'll beg Satan to save me
God I'm confused, the feuds of all these motherfuckers, makin' me sick
(*Virgin Mary never fucked nobody, but she suck dick*)
With a clique of nasty concubines, and vice versa
So she'll probably do the whole nine, that nasty ho
I don't know where I'mma go this Christmas, it's Satan's birth
I'mma try to smoke a pound of weed, and ease the Earth
While Jesus equipped with angels, the Devil's equipped with fire
For God so love the world that he blessed the thug with rock
Won't stop until they feel me
Protect me Devil, think the Lord is tryin' to kill me
It's vice versa
Heaven is below, while this dozier keep me high
To see the Lord Almighty nigga, I'm ready to die
My reply for any questions asked, "The Devil made me do it"
Who's the Devil may I ask?, It's so polluted
Uprooted from all this stupid shit
See me cremated, my adaption to the climate
So glad I made it
Elated that they gon' go to Heaven
But do they know Heaven may not be the place to go?
Again I ask, Heaven was Hell and vice versa
The devil's in me and I'll be damned if I'm gon let God hurt ya
Follow me...

[Verse 2: Peter the Disciple]
If this was vice versa, I'd be an angel, cause I'm a devil
A Down South Georgia Rebel, a whole 'nother fuckin' level
Reminiscin' on all the good and the bad that I did
Bustin' caps and splittin' wigs
And servin' nigs and talkin' shit
This is vice versa no fuckin' commercial
Heaven or Hell, where do we go
When we die, eternal fire or the streets of gold?
Only God knows, vice versa
