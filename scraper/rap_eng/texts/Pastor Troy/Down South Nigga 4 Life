[Chorus]

It's plain to see you can't change me
Down South nigga 4 life

It's plain to see you can't change me
Up North nigga 4 life

It's plain to see you can't change me
West coast nigga 4 life

It's plain to see you can't change me
East coast nigga 4 life


Verse 1: T-Mac

I'ma live by the game
Die by the game
It's in my blood
Cause real niggas don't change
Hustle first and ball later man
Guaranteed everything gone be greater man
Real niggas stay ahead of that game man
Focus on that goal
? Living small knots till a night we see ya know?
We bringing drama to the do'
Cause we ain't no hoe's
Respect my mind or I'ma bust ya with a slug low
Show you how the game go, this shit is to die for
Representing real shit
Dirty South affiliate
Niggas in the club getting busted in whigs
Memphis, Tennessee we throwing niggas off a bridge

Verse 2: Pastor Troy

And then hear I come right around the fucking corner
Eyes red smoking on that fucking marijuana
Somebody dead, looking mean
Where my niggas at?
Pastor Troy then I'm blazin' with that Infra-tech
I'm looking at 'cha cause I'm mad as a muthafucker
No time for suckers
A part time lover slash muthafucking hustler
I hang with S.M.K. and Eleven Twenty-Nine
I love them fucking niggas we done did it off the grind

Verse 3: Eleven Twenty-Nine

I be a down south nigga
Filiated with this
20 inches on my ride
In December the flicks
Call up E-40 on my cell phone out on the west
Cause we got business going down
Big faces, hundreds to stretch
I'm on the plane and I'm heading to New York for the C
My nigga Gage got sick
Tell 'em what's finna be
The Congregation just constructed and conducted the scene
Forever down south niggas keep yo eyes on the green
Cause I got family in Gary, Indiana up North
So when I'm there they show me luv
? So keep to these streets be the sort?
Deep in the bottom that's Miami
Ask my nigga Luke
Can S.M.K. hit you with beats that a make yo girl scream ohhh

Now where my ladies and my niggas from the north at?
Now where my ladies and my niggas from the south at?
Now where my ladies and my niggas from the east at?
Now where my ladies and my niggas from the west at?

[Chorus]

It's plain to see you can't change me
Down South nigga 4 life

It's plain to see you can't change me
Up North nigga 4 life

It's plain to see you can't change me
West coast nigga 4 life

It's plain to see you can't change me
East coast nigga 4 life
