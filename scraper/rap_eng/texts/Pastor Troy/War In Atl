Rappers hit the drawing board
When they here my vocal chords (COME ON)
I will never be ignored (COME ON)
Nigga this rap shit got me bored (pahp pahp)
Realest nigga in the A (AH HAH)
Fuck what them niggas say (AH HAH)
Shoot them out them skinny jeans (Reloading)
This g has the magazine

(War x 16 during this part)
Catch em with this double cut
Drive by and well em up
I don't lose a lick of sleep
Still bumpin' greg street
I hit the club one deag
Still got that street sweep
Damn nigga don't bust a move
Ain't no tellin what I might do

I'm VIP with that '22
Y'all nigga better watch em
Blocka blocka blocka if I eva have a problem
The pastor of disaster
Highly decorated
Highly underrated
I love it that you hate it
They said I wasn't gonna make it
Buy a wage don't fake it
But 20 years later
I'm still gettin' paper
And yet with no major
I'm major independent
You know I'm representin'

My ad-libs is vintage
My swag is authentic
My bitch is Malaysian
My hoe is Caucasian
My wife is Jamaican
My cars are so foreign
I'm sleepin', I'm snorin'
In California condos
Nigga shut the front door's

I told y'all a long time ago but you niggas didn't wanna listen
Drop one song and the rappers come up missin
They on the back of milk cartons signs hangin in the store
And yeah I know I'm cold nigga 20 below

So go and let them know I wanna see ya
And tell em to be careful when ya ridin round peters
This is not a threat this a guarantee
Y'all niggas don't wanna fuck with me (HEY-HEY-HEY-HEY)
And this right here?
This the SGB
The PTCRUZZA triple OG
I got medals and some ribbons
Killing competition
Snap a nigga out
Then I put em in submission
Go into his kitchen
Sissy wrist-flickin
Take them nigga chicken
YEAH WE TAKE THEM NIGGA CHICKEN
Bleed them nigga tied up
Jump back in that dually
Since everybody wanna make a motherfuckin movie
Check em off the list
Next Address
And put another school-y O in that GPS
Pull up on them niggas with the same mind-frame
Tie them niggas up and take EVERY DAMN THING
