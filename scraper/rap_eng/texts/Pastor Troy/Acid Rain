[Verse 1 - Pastor Troy]
(C'Mon!)
The pain enhances the misery swells (C'Mon!)
I'm screamin' ya name from a mountain in hell (C'Mon!)
I'm so low that the grounds above me (Yeah!)
It seems as if no one cares to love me (C'Mon!)
Maybe I'm crazy, addicted to pain (Yeah!)
Maybe the cocaine destroyed my brain (Yeah!)
Private conversations with +Kurt Cobain+ (Yeah!)
I'm drownin' my fears in the acid rain (Oh, Yeah!)

[Hook - Sky]
Demonic intentions take ova your mind
Like leaping from a building for the 50th time
Stay away from drugs little boys and girls
Unless you wanna live in the under world
2x -- (The under world, the under world. Unless you wanna live in the
Under world.) -- 2x

[Verse 2 - Pastor Troy]
(C'Mon!)
The sun goes down as the darkness prevails (C'Mon!)
Loss of conversation with Jezebel (C'Mon!)
She's so high always treatin' her nose (Yeah!)
Her blood runs black when her cycle flows (C'Mon!)
Maybe I'm psyched out for layin' her down (Yeah!)
Knowin' she then been with every man in town (Yeah!)
Maybe I'm hellbound for living insane (C'Mon!)
I'm drowning my pain in the acid rain (C'Mon!)

[Hook - Sky]

[Verse 3 - Pastor Troy]
(C'Mon!)
All of the heartaches and all of the pain (Yeah!)
All of the tear drops from acid rain (Yeah!)
There's one drop gone cuz they think I'm insane (C'Mon!)
Dissolving my mind with the use of cocaine (C'Mon!)
Like drinkin profusily and flying a plane (Yeah!)
So intoxicated I can't stay in my lane (Yeah!)
Private conversations with Kurt Cobain (Yeah!)
Drownin' my fears in the acid rain
