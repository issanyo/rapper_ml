[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah!
PT Cruiser, baby
Hey, yo, we want everybody to crank this motherfucker up, nigga
Crank this joint loud, nigga

[Bridge]
Crank me up
PT, baby, it's bout to get buck
I don't know maybe you never heard of
Caught 'em in the back of the club with black gloves
Hard as a hammer, I am Atlanta
As soon as I step on the scene it's lights, camera
Action, cashing fat ass checks, my Rolex
Will make you faint
You think I ain't
I hit the bank with 50 grand just to spend tonight
Nah, um, pass me them bills, mama, I got a flight
Lear, listen here, private jet at the door
A bad ass ho, into the clouds I go

[Verse 1]
The underground putting it down for 5 years
The blood, the sweat, the motherfucking tears
I'm living the life of a young drug lord
I'll blow this heifer up if I get bored
Now, ease up shorty, let the G slide through
And I don't leave without my .32
Tucked in the boots, tucked in the coat
And when I see Chuck, it's gon' get tucked in his throat
And 'Murder She Wrote', but hell, I can't read
Stab the ho, kidnapped the bitch seed
And now I'm on the loose, now I'm on the run
Fuck that shit, I go and get a bigger gun, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Motherfucker, nigga, crank me up
If you don't give a damn, nigga, we don't give a fuck
I bought ya CD, my man, y'all suck
Done sucked a cracker dick in the office and came up, get it
Never wore a vest, yeah, nigga, test
D.S.G.B. across my motherfucking chest, nigga
Yes, nigga, picture me [?]
When I done been raised by all these G's
The crooks and killers is my motherfucking niggas
Jab a pussy with some motherfucking scissors
This a motherfucking crime scene
I'm dumping on the law, my nigga, by any means

[Bridge]
Crank me up
PT, baby, it's bout to get buck
I don't know maybe you never heard of
Caught 'em in the back of the club with black gloves
Hard as a hammer, I am Atlanta
As soon as I step on the scene it's lights, camera
Action, cashing fat ass checks, my Rolex
Will make you faint
You think I ain't
I hit the bank with 50 grand just to spend tonight
Nah, um, pass me them bills, mama, I got a flight
Lear, listen here, private jet at the door
A bad ass ho, into the clouds I go, yeah!

[Hook](x2)
Crank me up
If you a gangster, you need to crank this up
If you don't give a damn, nigga, we don't give a fuck
Pastor, baby, 'bout to crank this up
Nigga, crank me up
