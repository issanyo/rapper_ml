[Intro]
Yeahh...
God...
We need you...
So many things going on in the world today Lord
I know you still waiting
Please don't leave me

[Hook x2]
My father told me that the world 'bout to end
Said God comin' back for his men
Now I'm asking God to forgive me for my sins
Huh, you know your son want in

[Verse 1]
I know you wonder where I've been
Do I still believe?
Am I still out chasing that cheese?
Do I tell my friends about ya?
Yeah Father God I can't live without ya
I know I ain't been the best but I'm blessed and I know
You ain't just with me and my show
So I grab the mic representing my change
Make 'em think I'm god when they mention my name
No I don't do this for no fame
I don't wanna sell no cocaine
I don't wanna go to no jail
I don't wanna burn in hell
Everyday is a strugle while my family hustle
And your boy ain't with it
So I gotta go get it
And I gotta be perfect
Doing this was a decision
And this for all y'all religons

[Hook x2]
My father told me that the world 'bout to end
Said God comin' back for his men
Now I'm asking God to forgive me for my sins
Huh, you know your son want in

[Verse 2]
My father told me that the world 'bout to end (Yeah!)
Made me think about what I've been (Yeah!)
Made me think about what I do (Yeah!)
Made me wanna live my life true (Yeah!)
I'm so ready for your comeback
I wanna see you take the world back
I wanna see you make the world BOW!
Lord you can come now
Watch my parents end it to the heaven
Empty out the clip of my holy Mac 11
No more weapons
Ain't just salute me
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody try'na shoot me (POW) (awwhaa)
My great-grandmother
I walk right over and I tell her that I love her
And when he come back
It's gon' be like that
But until then I got my hard hat (UH HUH!)

[Hook x2]
My father told me that the world 'bout to end
Said God comin' back for his men
Now I'm asking God to forgive me for my sins
Huh, you know your son want in

[Verse 3]
You know your son want in
You know I couldn't imagine
Some of the things you allowed to happen
Tornados wide as a mile
Took the life of a mother and child
Still I saw the father smile
Told me "You gotta be versatile"
Then I looked at my lil man
Shook my head
He don't even understand
One thang 'bout my God he got a plan
No I don't believe in no man
Yes I do believe in God's coming
And lemme tell y'all boys something
Better get right or you will get left
Better thank God for bein' straight when you haven't
Better thank me for keeping it real with ya
Huh
Until the Lord come and get ya

[Hook x2]
My father told me that the world 'bout to end
Said God comin' back for his men
Now I'm asking God to forgive me for my sins
Huh, you know your son want in
