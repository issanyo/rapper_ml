[Chorus]
Yeah
Poppin' on my phone
Prayin' I'ma say yo name in my song (Timbaland)
Well dumb ass nigga will be yo' name for today
And don't say shit while I say - what I say
But any damn way
I still ain't talkin' 'bout the shit
You just like Lil' John say "you just a bitch"
That gun powder - spit
Haha - actin like daffy duck
We hog tie niggas to the back of the fire truck
My ??balls?? ain't tough
It's whatever ??gorilla less??

Optimist prime
The PT cruiser a.k.a prime time

Also known as number 2
As long as I'm second - then I'm after you
Ain't nothing else to do but rock the whole region
It's Pastor Troy
Georgia boy huntin season
Now tell me

[Chorus till end]
