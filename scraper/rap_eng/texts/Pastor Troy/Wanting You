(*Talking*)
Yo, yo, wassup baby
At the studio I'm almost finished
Where you at? alright, I miss you too nigga
Shit, I'm with K, I'm with KC and shit
I'll be out there as soon as I get finished with this shit
Alright, love you, miss you too

[Pastor Troy]
Girl I'm wantin you, everyday I'm missin you
Visions of me kissin you, goddamn I'm missin you
I can wait to cuddle up, you already know what's up
Soon as I jump out my truck, you was gon get gangsta fucked
Cause baby girl I want you, close my eyes and picture you
Thinkin bout some freaky shit, me and my ol' gangsta bitch
Yeah boo I want you, wonder if you want me
Takin you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me

[Chorus] - 2x
Girl I want you, everyday I'm missin you
Visions of me kissin you, goddamn I'm missin you
Yeah boo I want you, wonder if you wantin me
Takin you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me

[Pastor Troy]
Girl I want you, I could see your silhouette
Tellin me your soakin wet, while we havin phone sex
Better yet I'm on my way, I'ma do whatever you say
Where ever you tell me kiss, I'ma spread your legs like this
Cause baby girl I'm wantin you, I can't get that fast enough
What the fuck you done did to me? I can't hit that that's enough
Matter fact unlock that do', I'ma be there 'fore you know
Turn on your radio and make sure it's somethin slow

[Chorus] - 2x

[Gangsta Boo]
I ain't with that nonsense, or that luvy-duvy mess
I wanna fuck you nice and slow, (?) want some of that Georgia dick
Get you some of this Memphis wet, mussy cause it be the best
Smashin all across the bed, now I'm gonna give you head
Nothin but sex is on my mind, so I'm not gon waste ya time
I'ma let you bang the pussy from the front and from behind
Give it to me Pastor Troy, oh my God I love you boy
I'ma make you scream my name, doin all kind of freaky thangs
You ain't gonna forget the mystic pleasure that I give to you
Have yo ass lay back on the bed thinkin what have I just done to you
Think about me when you fuck yo bitch, close yo eyes and imagine this
I told you I ain't the type to get involved in long relationships
I just like when you lick between, man I feel like I'm on lean
Now you got me so-so high, I'm glad we on eachother team
Fuck my nigga, fuck yo bitch, mayne we on some other shit
You wonderin, don't wonder mayne I love you and it's my dick

[Chorus] - 2x
