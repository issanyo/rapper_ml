Verse 1: (Pastor Troy)

If I'm ackin up, you better cut of the game
I ain't got to say nothing, just have to tell them my name
I'm the flame, I got mo' flame then a lighter
I ain't trying to be lame, but this ain't nobody fighter
The southern writer, the preacher and keep a heater beside
Oomp Camp and Pastor Troy we letting it ride
So many died, I ain't never been the one for that
So now I travel everywhere with mack mack mack
I crack heads till I'm fed, and I dodge tricks
I cut the game off quick past ninety-six
I'm getting sick of the game
Just handle my business man
I catch ya slippin', I'ma lick ya ass for everything
We Ready

And if it's anger, I'm ready to shuv that in a nigga mouth

Make them niggas come clean or bust they head with the beam
