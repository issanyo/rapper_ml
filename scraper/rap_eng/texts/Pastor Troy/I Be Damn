(Pinhead)
Cause I be damn if a nigga won't
Damn if a nigga will
Damn if I won't get my Glock out and shoot to kill
Damn if I'm gonna miss
Damn if I'm getting bitched
Damn if you gonna play me out like I'm new to this
Damn if it ain't a hit
Damn if this ain't the song
That you realize that them Georgia boys dropping bombs
Damn if I ain't gone ride in the Benz getting high
Damn if I ain't in the back loading up a 45
Damn when it's time to blaze
To the hood getting paid
Damn when my niggas busting shops full of that gunplay
Damn when I see a hoe, got to let that bitch know
That I'm rolling dro in that motherfucking optimo
Damn when I'm gonna leave with your bitch smoking weed
Got them fucking hoes in the club steady jocking me
