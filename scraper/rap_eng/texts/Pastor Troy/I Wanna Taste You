Verse One
Now im jus sittin here, watchin my, baby in her lingerie
Im kissin her, holdin her, listenin to 12 play
And im sunk in one, hopin one, day she could be wifey
Thugged up from da flo up but hell dats why she like it
So politely, I asked her, why does she love da pastor?
Did she love me combo or was it just my condo?
She answered me, pronto, why don't you believe me?
If you don't believe me then motha f**ka leave it
I loved it, her answer; it killed me like a cancer
All I could do is smile; she knew it the whole while
I could see you wit my child, look me in my face boo
How can I replace you? Baby, I wanna taste you

I wanna taste you
(Said I wanna taste you babah)
'cause you look so good to me. (Wohhwohh)
(I wanna taste you baby)
I wanna taste you

'cause you look so good to me

Verse two baby
Verse Two

Ok
Very few sights, Light da lights, how you light em up
Love how we f**k, love when I get my dick sucked
What tis up? Layback down, you know im gon hold you down
Got dat thang all nice and shaved, im bout'a let my tounge cave
Lickin ha neck, lickin ha ear, girl don't run bring yo ass here
Lickin her spine makin her cringe, then I suck her titties, then
Lick around her belly ring, ('cause) imma bout'a do da thing
Kissin on her thigh, as I listen to r Kelly sing
12 play soft, in the back-ground its goin down
I just feel her finga tips, every time I lick her lips
She grabbin on my dreads, im cummin out dat head
And gon give her breakfast in bedâ€¦. that's my baby

I wanna taste you
