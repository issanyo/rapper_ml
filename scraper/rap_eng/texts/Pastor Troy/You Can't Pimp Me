[Pastor Troy talking]
Pimp shit
Yeah pimp shit, nigga
Wassup baby Ken?
Like this hea
All my niggas mayn
A yo, all the real boss playa
A yo, this real ATL playa style
A yo, you can't pimp a pimp playa

[Verse 1]
Niggas is trippin, my shoes is tied up
Big boss pimpin, tell ya' bitch I said wassup
Pastor, laughter, Remy in my hand
Countin out some grands, ova in Ireland
The man, you done heard the name befo'
I keep a big gun wit' me every where that I go
And I smoke dro', motherfucker keep that bap ass weed
Niggas claimin their my folks bitch you don't know me
D.S.G.B. representin send them haters to hell
It ain't nothing ta' say, it ain't nothin ta' tell
My Glock shells will be empty if any tempt me
I'm not no fuckin simp, bitch I'm a fuckin pimp

(Chorus 2x)
You can't pimp me, I'mma pimp myself
You can't pimp me, I'mma pimp myself
You can't pimp me, I'mma pimp myself
I'mma pimp myself
I'mma pimp myself

[Verse 2]
The one man army, the one wreckin crew
I heard that shit, now who the fuck you referrin to
If it was me, come put your finger to my nose
Just like I thought ya' niggas mother fuckin hoes
The clothes, the wardrobe, the gators with matchin socks
Bad ass bitch that kind of favors Goldielox
The clock...stops tickin'
I step off in the spot all the chickens get to pimpin'
Bubbly is pluckin, D.S.G.B. be gangsta fuckin'
Fuckin for nothin, we be them niggas they be lovin'
It don't get nothin but worse for you simp
Bow down nigga make room for a pimp

(Chorus 2x)

[Peter Tha Disciple]
You can't pimp me potnah because I'm pimpin myself
I got my game from the old school straight off the shelf
I be the maca to the roni, the chedda to the cheese
I roll wit' DSGB, so is better than me
A Aug representive, I got the game on lock
I hit the street with them thangs, went to movin the block
So fuck the cops, we makin money, we stay on the grind
I'm bustin strawberry Phillies while I break down my pine
And I ain't blind, I can see it, you already know
So get the fuck out my face 'cause you can't pimp me hoe
You see the doe don't let it hit ya', you gets no play
And I'm the dro' you the philly get ready to blaze

(Chorus fade out)
