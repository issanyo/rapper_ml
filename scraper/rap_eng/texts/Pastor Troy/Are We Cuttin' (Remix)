Cause I can't stand a man that don't understand
I'm weighing kilos and grams, the bitch with the upper-hand
I'm bout to kill it, you dealin' with the realest
Fuck the strawberries and chocolate
Hennesy and a condom, say they kissin' and grindin'
It's all about the timin', I really like Vice Versa
But tonight's much worser, and um

Had me out Atlanta just to see you in your belt and Timb's
