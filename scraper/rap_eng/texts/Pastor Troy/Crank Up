[Intro]
Yeeah, PT Cruiser Baby, Yeeah
AiYo, we want everybody to crank this muhfucka up
Nigga, Crank this shit up LOUD NIGGA! (okay)

[Hook]
Crank Me Up, PT baby is back to get bucks
I dont know maybe ya never, heard of
Comin in the back of the club with black gloves
Hard as a hammer, I am Atlanta
Soon as i step on the scene, its lights camera
Action, Cash In, Fat-ass cheques, my rolex
Will make ya faint,huh, ya think i ain't?
I hit the bank and get the grands, and just to spin tonight
Nuh-uh, pass me the mills mamma, i got a flight
Lears, listen here, private jet at the-yo (?)
A bad ass ho, into the clouds I Go
The underground putting it down for five years
The blood, The sweat, the motherfucking tears
I'm living the life of a young, drug lord
I'll build this heffa up if i get bored
Now ease up shorty, let the G slide through
And i don't leave, without my .32
Tucked in the boot(boot),Tucked in a coat(coat)
And when i see Chuck, its gonna get tucked in his throat
And murder she wrote? But hell, I can't read
Stabbed a ho, kidnapped the bitch, see?
And now i'm on the loose, now im on the run
Fuck that shit, I'll go and get a bigger gun
Yeah! Motherfucker (Nigga)
Crank Me Up!
If you dont give a damn, nigga, we dont give a fuck
I watch your CD's, my man, y'all suck
You suck a cracka's dick in the office then came up
Get it? Never for this, damn nigga test
See how she be because my motherfuckin chest, Nigga
Yes nigga, picture me, hot caprice
When i dun been raised by all these G's
Nigga, the crooks and killers, is my motherfuckin niggas
Jab a pussy, with some motherfuckin scissors
This is a, motherfuckin, crime scene
I'm dumpin on the law, my nigga, by any means
