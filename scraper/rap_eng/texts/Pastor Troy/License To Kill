I'm out on a limb
I-I'm out on a limb-limb-limb
Well I'm Pastor Troy I got a license to kill
I shot that 50 cal.in your motherf*ckin' grill
Niggas talking shit but everybody got a tounge
What you got to say when I'm chillin' with my gun
PT nigga I got the license and I'm trifling
Catch him in his hood and get to motherf*ckin' sniping
I wish them niggas would but them niggas ain't real
A license- a license- a license to kill
I been in this game since them dukey roll chains
Chillin with my uncle off sellin' cocaine
Smoking weed with my friends when I was 10
Outside of the school drinking motherf*ckin' gin
Well I'm Pastor Troy I got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get real
Now what do we have here, a f*ck nigga in fear
I run this land you understand I make my self clear
Well I'm Pastor Troy I got the license to murk
I leave them niggas dick in the motherf*ckin' dirt
Been puttin' in work since I got my first pistol
From my 22 to my motherf*ckin' missile
A L-I-c-ense to kill
Extreme heat (huh) is all you feel
A 100 round 223 you can't dodge it
I put you on the beam and I'm making my deposit
Rockets, grenades, and the machete
Military issue K cause I'm ready
I'm dumpin' and I'm dumpin' so you better write your will
A license- a license- a license to kill
