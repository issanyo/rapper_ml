Come on cuz, we almost there
We almost there cuz
Goddamn, where the finish line?

Fuck this shit, I need some chees
And I need it quicker than Nestle
If I have to kill then God bless me
All these pussy motherfuckers, they shouldn't have test me
Left me looking like the villian , I was thinking of ending
Nobody knew what I was going through
All these motherfuckers saying what they gonna do
But then again all these motherfuckers ain't true
So who am I gonna trust, am I going on and bust
Myself nigga, damn this shit
Fuck riding round' nigga, fuck being rich
I can't take it, the shit to thick
And it ain't my fault
So I ought to give the motherfucker telling lies to me
Hey the say, what its gonna be, but empty pockets all I goddamn see
D-E-F, no ones left, then again, shit no ones right
I'm a kill my damn self the night
I get fear, it ain't my fault he couldn't fight
It ain't like, when I motherfucking die, this whole world gonna fall apart
But it's a race, and I got a bad heart
Breath in the mouth, and I got a head start

I'm running for nothing, I'm running for nothing (x8)
So I'm gonna kill myself

A muthafucka tellin me what he gone do
When I knew the muthafucka wouldn't do shit
A nigga tease you, then a nigga leave you
Cause he heard that the shit done got thick, punk bitch
I get in the mood for cocaine
Cuz it's the only thing I see when a nigga look
Come and get the baking soda, then I flip the powder over
Then I got good dope when the shit cooked
But it crippled my to really understand that it really don't matter
What the fuck you been through
If a muthafucka see you doin better my nigga I'm here to tell ya
Muthafuckas gonna hate you
Not a clue, If I really woulda knew, muthafuckin 22
2 years wasn't far away
I never would have had a chance to enjoy Pastor Troy, woulda killed myself on
Yesterday

Hook

This heaven, where the streets of gold, and why the hell is the a/c off?
Where the fuck, all the loved ones that I lost?
Fuck this shit, take me to the boss
Do you understand the cost that was paid
In order for me to be here tonight?
Nigga whats up, something ain't right
Tell the Lord to turn on the damn light
Feeling like an angel when I take flight
Shit, as I try with all my damn might
All my power seem out my damn sight
Look, why the fuck I was packed so tight
Nigga I ain't Mike, I'm Micah
Think I'm in the wrong spot
Not only do I have on black, its too hot
But why am I by the motherfucker ain't shot
I got no halo, hello, motherfucker shit nigga, I'm talking to you
Slap the clip in the tech 22
Let the shit fly and it went straight through
Now I got a clue, where the fuck I'm at
Shot him with the tech and the nigga didn't budge
Nigga just bleedin', motherfucker out of blood
Looking at me smilin', asking me what
I got guts, but guts, goddamn
Paradise,shit I can't tell
Went from dwellin' in hell on earth
Now I'm living in hell in hell
