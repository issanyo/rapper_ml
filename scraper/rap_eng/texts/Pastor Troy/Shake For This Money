I gotta like what I see
But you got a safe for this money
I stepped in the club, sipping ...
I don't clean adds a b**ch
So why these hoes on my job?
I got punked out till one
We about to have fun
You gon know when I'm done
I'm with that on my son
I got too b**ches on mollie
And we here f**king up follie
And we hit Matrix city
I'mma bring dancers with me
We in my two seater
And we heading down B street
They got safe for this money
But I kinda like what I see

[Hook]
That Matrix city turned up
They say blue plane turned up
They say pink bullet that club
I got sh*t club turned up
Got that strokers turned up
Got that pin notes turned up
Say that goosebumps, that Queen city
They say ... turned up, Ahmaly just turned up
Got my black car, I'm telling a lot
I'm tryna see what's up
