[Verse 1:]
Excuse me baby let me holla at ya right quick
I see ya sitting by ya self, can I sit
Been watching you since I jumped out the red six
It's Pastor Troy little mama, I run shit
I was just thinking if you got a minute for a nigga
We grab a bite to eat, maybe let me kick it with ya
I'ma be cool
If ya wanna we can hit the pool, all at the house
I know ya think this nigga is a fool
I'm from the south if ya got a minute we can chill
Do what ya like if ya don't baby keep it real
What's up tonite
I know ya like I ain't even told this boy my name
But I love the way he kicking his game
Then I got changed
[Pastor Troy talking to woman]

[Verse 2:]
How many folks ya know will open up yo car do'
You wanna smoke baby [inhaling smoke] its hydro
I'm looking at ya cause it's cute how you inhale
I think you gone fall in love with the ATL
I got my hand in the middle of the console
You know I wanna hold ya hand
You gone tell me no
If so, I'ma roll me up another beam
You done smoked all my weed now you acting mean
I'm coming clean
Looking at her like I'm innocent
So what's yo hobby how you feel about getting intimate
We hit the lobby checking in to the Radisson
Give me a suit now we chilling in the whirlpool
Let's go to sleep we can freak on the next trip
I know you drained I ain't coming on the sex tip
I'm shooting game everything was to get to know ya
Now if you'll excuse me I'll be rolling over
And I still got changed
[Pastor Troy talking to woman]

[Verse 3:]
I left that muthafucking ho on the top flo'
I kissed on her forehead boo I got to go
I'm making moves 22 fuck a real job
All I think about is money I'm in a mob
Hit the crib matching car with the outfit
What should I do if she see me with the chrome kit
The navy blue look at who got 'em turning heads
And then every dime legit so who is the feds
My eyes red cause I'm matched down cascade
A little fine red girl said she wanna play
I'm on the cell phone tripping baby where you stay
This how we do it down here in the letter A
And then I got changed
