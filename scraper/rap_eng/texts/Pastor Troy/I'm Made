Uh-huh (I didn't wanna do them niggas like this)
Huh, uh-huh! (I didn't even wanna do them niggas like this)

[Hook]
If I go out in a blaze
Tell all them pussy motherfuckers I was gunning 'til I fell in my grave
And I don't sweat the disrespect
I explode with a Tec to let them know that I was never afraid
If I go out in a blaze
Tell all them pussy motherfuckers I was gunning 'til I fell in the grave
And I don't sweat the disrespect
I explode with a Tec to let them know that I was never afraid
Bitch, I'm motherfuckin' made
Bitch, I'm motherfuckin' made
Bitch, I'm motherfuckin' made
Bitch, I'm motherfuckin' made

[Verse 2]
Yeah, verse 2, I'm a make you feel real lame
Got a gram talking 'bout he in the dope game
Say he got a nigga coming from Bermuda
I'm a introduce ya nigga to my Ruger
You got 30 ki's, nigga, bring the ki's out
Motherfucker, you still sleeping at ya mama house
Selling dope for 5 years with no profit
Bitch, if you can't come up, you needs to stop it
Rap game, I locked it, nobody else can enter

We in the winter riding drop top
Pussy nigga, you need to stop, give me my props
They call the cops but that ain't necessary
(So, tell 'em why!) I'm made
Go get some knowledge from yo library
Pussy nigga, learn to get paid

[Hook]
If I go out in a blaze

And I don't sweat the disrespect
I explode with a Tec to let them know that I was never afraid
If I go out in a blaze
Tell all them pussy motherfuckers I was gunning 'til I fell in the grave
And I don't sweat the disrespect
I explode with a Tec to let them know that I was never afraid
