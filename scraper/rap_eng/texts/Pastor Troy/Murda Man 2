Verse 1 Pastor Troy
I heard some bitch ass niggas had an attitude
I eat 'em up like some motherf**kin dog food
I know it sounds rude It's suppost to
And pussy nigga I motherf**kin own you
On the radio talkin bout this and that
I stay home listen and cleanin my gat
At first they like Pastor Troy can't belive 'em
Kick in the door and then motherf**kin eat 'em
Snap his ass up then
Then attack his friends
Then slap that bitch and she motherf**kin friends
To the end it's motherf**kin on hoe
It's Pastor troy and I'm havin fun hoe

Chorus
I don't think they wanna f**k with the murda man
F**k wit the murda man f**k wit the murda man f**k wit the murda man
I don't think they wanna f**k with the murda man
F**k wit the murda man f**k wit the murda man f**k wit the murda man
I don't think they wanna f**k with the murda man
F**k wit the murda man f**k wit the murda man f**k wit the murda man
I don't think they wanna f**k with the murda man
F**k wit the murda man f**k wit the murda man f**k wit the murda man
