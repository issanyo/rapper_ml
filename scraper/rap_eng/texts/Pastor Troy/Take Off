Pastor Troy:
A sad day for da rap game im about to tell em my name(Pastor!!!!!)
A.k.a they call me megatron da cepracon i flip into a gun and burn one
Soon as I duck I go change my disguise my first pump da last thing in his eyes
And I ain't thinkin bout no get back I got a army dat can handle dat
Matter-a-fact you about to be introduced duck duck duck let loose
His triple fat goose look like cheddar cheese
Mention he ain't got no cheese then I leave
Huffin and puffin got my blood pressure high
Must ain't no I will ride till I die
I put it all on da resume
To come be out da Ga (now say)

Chorus:Im ready for take off take off
Im ready for take off (say what)
Im ready for take off take off
Im ready for take off say boss
2x

Verse 2:
They say da rap game like da dope game
I already had a car tell
Talkin to my fam on da burned cell
Short wit da money we give em hell
Every shell
Shots rang out all you hear is da dude
Comin gureilla it ain't no rules
You say you a killa but won't let nuttin die
Caught em given mouth to mouth to fly
Dats why I am ready for take off
Fillet menoun without da steak sauce
Da top of da line dats me Im prime
Had da underground on lock since '99
While you was trying to figure out yo style yo image
Look what you became a mothaf**kin gimmick
Smilen and grinnin you know who you are
Problem sit me meet me at da bar
So far its three rappers I like
Me,myself,and I and Im tight
And you ain't gots to tell me im high
Smell the aroma as I pass by
V.i.p everywhere dat I go
Soon I as I hit da door they blaze dro
And if I muthaf**kin die today
Know dat I had da balls to say

Chorus:2x
