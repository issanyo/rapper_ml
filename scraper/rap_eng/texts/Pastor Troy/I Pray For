I pray for peace and equality
I pray for opportunity
I pray for everything that I feel is due to me
I pray for both of my parents
I pray for mother and father
I pray for prayin to God let me put meals on the altar
I pray for niggas I'm missin
I pray for niggas in prison
I pray for niggas in the ground
Can't wait to hear the sound of mothafuckin laughter
Asking God to have mercy on the Pastor
You know my heart
I pray for niggas with no where to stay
They put them people on the street every other day
It's people starving right here in our country man
But yet we still dropping food in Afghanistan
Don't understand
I pray for the congress, I pray for the president
I pray for that nigga locked down with no evidence
It's all gone be straight cuz
It's all depending on the level of your faith cuz
I'm prayin for ya

I know I ain't no pastor
But I still pray
I'm thankful for the sunshine like everyday
Too many things taken for granted, don't understand it
Don't stray away from them
You gots to pray for em
I pray for niggas with nothing
I pray for all of my cousins
I pray for all of my people, we all here struggling
I pray for all of the teachers
I pray for all of the preachers
I pray for wisdom and knowledge
What makes me a leader
I pray for all of my rights
I pray for all of my wrongs
I pray for all of my niggas that's dead and gone
Guess we'll holla in the after life
I always heard them say that death was a small price
A sacrifice
I pray for the orphans
I pray for all of the homeless
The reason we suffer cause God knows we the strongest
Together we stand, divided we fuckin fall
Come with a plan understand we can kill 'em all
I pray for the weak
I pray for the weary
I pray for that nigga that listen to me sincerely
Its all gone be straight cuz
Its all depending on the level of your faith cuz
I'm prayin for ya
