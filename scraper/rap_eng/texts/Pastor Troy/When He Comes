Verse 1
Come on, come on
Its going to get crazy in the city
ASkin God is he really coming back to get me
Or playing with yeaa
And everything i ever learned as a child
Revalations the whole worlds going wild
Lord come now yeaaa
Got my pistol,got my bottle, got my warface
And if the church is the only place i feel safe
But i got faith and i mean real faith
Not Faith Evans im talking bout the faith that places you in heaven
When i see the Lord i'ma bow down and shoot a bird at them devils cause its on
Now
It's on now

(chorus)
When he comes
No where to run
On that day
The world gonna pay
When he comes

Verse 2
Yea
I can see Jesus in all white riding on a stallion like a night
Ready to fight yea
And im gonna to be right beside him
Got my a-k cocked right beside him
Behind him yeaaa
Nothing but thugs on the Lords side
And i was sent to heaven where we reside
Ready to ride ain't no mo nickles and dimes primetime
Captured for my savors blood yea the wine
Believe it now time to come to take over
Better watch ya lanuage son God's Jahovah
And when it all over and i am acknowledge
To show that i did it and did in college i followed
My own, my own soul,the Lion of Judaaa

(chorus)
Heavenly father
I pray right now
For everyone under the
Sound of my voice
That they come to know you
As Lord and Saviour in there lives
Help us Lord
To understand that you are soon
To come for your people
And we won't have time to get ready
But must already, be ready
For in the bosom of an eye
You shall appear to recieve Your all
Unto Yourself
Our hearts desire Oh Lord
Is to be ready when You come
Help us Lord to forgive one another
Just as you forgave on Calvirage cross
Help us to love one another
Just as you loved and gave your only son
That we shall not perish but shall have
Everlasting lives
Help us Lord to stand in your righteousness
And to ??? every barrier of racial, and ethnic, and social, and economic
Devision
Help us to see ????????.......
