[Verse: Pastor Troy]
My mind on money, what the hell you thinking bout?
The cars, the broads, the stocks, the house
To find my mouth, I'm spitting flames wit Banner
Mississippi putting it down wit Atlanta
No cameras, bitch this ain't no camera trick
Ain't no stunt man needed, bitch you best to believe it
Some niggas say I'm conceded, I say you God damn right
Them same motherfucking niggas gon' get robbed tonight
You wanna pick up the fight? I wanna crank up the war
These niggas taking me light, how you gon' take the .44?
I ain't no ho my nigga, so don't you tamp-on me
Leave ya R.I.P., bitch this DSGP!
You see the horns on my head? nigga you know I'm the devil
And I pack heavy metal, WHAT THE FUCK you gon' settle
Bitch you better settle down I'm a real ass nigga
I'm strictly bout my scrilla, motherFUCK them niggas

And bust it on a bitch, to me it ain't shit

So come to Mississippi and we taking yo hoes, pick in yo dome
BOOM, hoes and clothes wit black .44s and Calico's
Give a FUCK what a bitch nigga know, you know this
You getting stuck like Al Green and a bitch wit some hot grits

And spelling bread raw backwards in yo two way, all life
