Kept it treal, locked our grills, stayed away from them buster's
Hidey hi, hidey ho, listen nigga this here how it go
C-4 to ya door, blow yo muthaf*ckin block off
Thoroughbred, bitch, ho, nigga, let's lock up
A-t-l-a-n-t-a, G-A that's where I f*ckin' stay
Haps and hurl ya gats, listen boy check ya map
Hydro, I blow everyday all day
When I die Lord please let me be high and f*cked up
A blunt off in my mouth and some yak off in my cup
Chin checking, wig splitter, with a tank off in my pants
F*ck the talking, square it out, cock ya pistol let's dance
It's Tight IV Life and this ya Colonel, Mr. D-r-a-m-a

But since ya won'ts ta ask, then I got to let 'cha know
I represent Atlanta, Georgia, please believe that's on the blow
It's on da map (uh huh, yeah!)

I stand there patiently, then I start cranking up
This Remi in my cup

I come from way back, it's Bankhead ho
A North Avenue, 1342
While you at home with boo, I'm on the grind ho

Just thought I'd let y'all know
I puff upon my dro', the best I ever had
Please do not make me mad, with all the ackin bad
Boy I swear I got some bullets long as ding-a-ling
And I ain't only killing you I'm killing everything
So bling bling if ya wanna, I'm cut off jeans and a tee
I'm representing like a flag for D.S.G.B
Ain't nothing free so you ol' me for this ass spankin'
Where the muthaf*ckers from what'cha thinking
It's on da map (uh huh, yeah!)
There come the police, knocking on my do'
With the GBI, said I was over the Georgia line
I committed a homicide
Running for my life this year it's 2000 I'm bout to get mine
Started flipping the scrip, on the grind, all the time
Now it's tragedy, cause everybody know what's happening
They got me up at the post office, they after me
Can't capture me
I'm a young gun, a desperado
Go blow for blow
I'm a hell of a nigga, they already know
I know they'll try that's why I got my vest protecting my chest
And I'm dressed in black boy
And that's the really take care of the rest
I'm feeling distressed, I know I should've but do I would
Muthaf*cker tried to buck, that's why I had to do it
I could've blew it, I did it execution style
He was on his knees and nailed his hands on the bathroom tile
I stayed awhile, and filled the house of evidence
They go through hell f*cking with this Georgia resident
It's on the map (uh huh, yeah!)
They bout to see a blood bath, A blood bat
