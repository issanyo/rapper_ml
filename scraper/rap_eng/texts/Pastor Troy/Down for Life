[Verse 1:]
My Baby Rockin Dooney An Bourke

And She Buy High Boots The Same Color As Her Skirt
Independant So Bad She Ignant
But She Still Mine Ima Let Her Represent
Trips To La To Do Lunch
Then Fly Back To D.C. To Do Brunch
Got My Baby Momma Feelin Like A Dunce
Being Wit Me Is All The Girl Wants
An When We Ain't Together We On The Nextel
Got Eachothers Picture Screen Saved On The Cell
At The Bell Ring
Pop Champain An Throw Rice
My Baby We Is Down For Life
Down For Life

[Chorus:]
Ill Be There For You
Wil You Be There For Me

I Wanna Be Down For Life(Down For Life)

I Can Be Ya Boo
You Can Be My Nigga
You Kno I Hold It Right Babe
You Kno Ill Pull A Trigger(Down For Life)
I Wanna Be Down For Life(Down For Life)
For Life(Down For Life)

[Verse 2:]
I Can See Me An You Crunk Boo
In That New Cadillac That Seat Two
What Ever You Wanna Do We Can Do It Times Two
Cuz You So Damn Cute An So Damn Fine
The Vip Line Everytime That We Club
Niggas Lookin At Chu Cuz You Sittin On Dubz
An Everytime We Hug An Everytime We Kiss
I Scratch Another Chick Off My Mothafuckin List
Ya See Its Like This

Untill You Let Me Hit In My Drop Top Benz
Now I Can't Go A Day Without Callin You
And When I Ask You What Chu Doin You Say
