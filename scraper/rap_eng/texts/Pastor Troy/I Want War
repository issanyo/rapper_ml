[Hook x6]
Hey, hey, let's go
You say you want war let's go, let's go
You say you want war let's go, let's go
You say you want war, let's go
(I want war) Hey

Yeah, PT Cruiser nigga
Cruiser!

[Verse 1]
You say you want war let's go, let's go
All of the gangstas down on the floor
Everybody thuggin', everybody muggin'
You already know I'm Southside ho
Say you want war better come correct
Lot's of ammo and lot's of texts
I don't bullshit and I don't flex
But I must protect where I cash a check
Say you want war well nigga I'm with it
Say you want war well nigga come get it
I'm so gangsta I'm on exhibit
Y'all fucked niggas gon' deal with it
Say you want war, nigga drop the bomb
Watch how quick I sound the alarm
Hear the alarm and that's when I snap
Bap, bap, b-a-a-p
AK-47 I know, gangsta niggas stick to the code
Find my target and I explode because:

[Hook x5]

Man, flip this shit up
Flip it up!

[Verse 2]
Say you want war but I don't think that they want me
D.A.G.P. hundred round 2-3-3 (?)
Bustin' and I'm cussin' and I'm looking for a partner
While I shoot, you pour my vodka
Drinking Absolut cause I'm a absolute fool
And all y'all fucked niggas can get it
Forget it
If you forget it, you're in trouble
Cause I'm gon' remind ya when they find her
Say you want war then send the bomb
Murder men and drinking red rum
Standing outside with the big boy gun
Y'all niggas don't want none
Hey

[Hook x5]
