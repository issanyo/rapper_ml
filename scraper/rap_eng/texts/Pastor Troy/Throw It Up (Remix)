[Verse 2: Pastor Troy]
The last nigga is the Pastor
Ready to blast ya
You know (come on), I don't play no motherfucking games

Wood grain in the motherfucking Dooley truck
Got the black and red seats with the Georgie tuft
And I got my helmet hanging out the window
Ready to bust the head of a fucking pretender
Nigga as soon as I enter you know I'm making noise
Pastor Troy and the East Side Boyz
A-K bustin', I ride the whole clip
I cock that ho and let it motherfucking rip
To sank ship is what I live for
Fuck him (haha), fuck her (come on)

So I can throw it up

[Chorus: Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz]
Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Born in the dirty dirty, stop and they still spinnin'
They tried to hit me like 50 but bitch I'm still livin'
Flinch and I get ya hit, do it like them Georgia boys
The A-K with the rubber grip, it's something they ain't seen before
Look Jon I think they scared, let's bring them down south
And show 'em how the Chevy's look and how our hoes bounce
Shorty don't want no trouble, shorty don't wanna fight
But let him keep talkin' I bet ya shorty gon' die tonight
I planned on gettin' put out the club before I came
My hood down for whatever, we all ride with them thangs
Breakin' bottles across niggas heads, fuck what a hater said
Them gangstas don't live long as the ones that ain't breakin' bread
I tried to keep it up, just quit and let my man's get it
Don't see no bricks but I still got my hands in it
CashVille Ten-A-key, I told y'all I'm a blow it up
G-Unit soldier, my nigga, now come and throw it up

[Chorus: Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz]
Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up
Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up
Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up
Throw it up (where you from), throw it up
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club
