Okay, Okay
Ain't this a bitch, these niggas try'n to capture
The Pastor, don't they know who they after
Disaster, swear it's comin'
Please explain why these pussy muthafuckaz runnin'
Like fuckin' sprinters, I'll eat you niggas up for dinner
Hungry for niggas, thank the Lord for creatin' liquor
Now I don' throwed away all the Alize and Hennesey
Shit my chameleon went with God, see what I'm doin'
While I'm chewin', y'all muthafuckaz

[Chorus: Loko]
Will your label pull a Ski Mask?  (AH HA!!!)
Will you label do a nigga ass? (AH HA!!!)
Big Oomp Bitch, Big Oomp Bitch

[Pastor Troy]

Now Sammy Sam, how the fuckin' police gon' pat me down
Got picked up with Big Oomp and fuck it, here I am

[Chorus: Loko]

[Bezelee]
You gimme 7-10 G's and I'mma crank this bitch

Anyone see us comin', already see these niggas runnin'
These niggas ain't said nuh'n, cuz we comin', we gunnin'

See Bezelee operatin' and got this bitch sellin'

See niggas say Bezelee, Pastor Troy get rowdy

We got enough ammunition can't see these hoe niggas
All y'all niggas and some more of y'all niggas

Loko: (4x)
Oomp Camp (Big Oomp Bia...)

[Chorus: Loko]

[Loko]
We got that hard, we got that real
We like to mugg, pack that steal
We like to keep 'em jumpin'
Fuck nigga want somethin'
Pull out the pump and leave danglin'
Manglin', leave 'em stranglin'
Fake thug, Oomp Camp is what it was
A swarm of real niggas, really don't give a fuck
When it come to straight bangin', come to straight slangin'
If Oomp said get 'em nigga you best start stangin'

[Naudi Shawty]
Now I'mma cock this thang back
And make these muthafuckaz change they act
Must don't know what kinda cats they dealin' wit', you better ask
Ain't no matter, when it comes down to gats, I promise that
Snatch you muthafuckin' life quick, sick with the strap
Make 'em move or we gon' kill somethin'
You still frontin', we gon' show up where you live dumpin'
We bout that money and anything else, can't help, nigga fuck that
You bust at me, I'm bustin' back, with a bigger gat

Chorus: Loko (2x)
