Bull Dog tag Bull Dog flag Bull Dog bitch Bull Dogs bad
Comin' out my window smokin' on some endo
My partner poncho he just jacked up his Bronco
Mud on my tires wanna raise it higher

Ridin' in our big toys we makin' noise
Got the pedal to the middle in my country boy lean
It's been a bad day if it comes home clean
I keep the mud flyin' and I ain't even tryin'
I'll take you for a ride if you think I'm lyin'
Go on and talk trash meet me in the back
We'll see if you can back up all the comments from the past
Stay ridin' high and I keep it jacked up
12 gauge on the back glass and I'm spittin' in a Mudjug
That's right er'day and er'night
I love hittin' mud just to see it takin' flight
You know we jack 'em up you know we like 'em big
You know we got folks talkin' 'bout what we did
If you wanna ride high and be like us
