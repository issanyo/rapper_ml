[Juvenile]
I heard about that money, that's some nice change
For the right price, we'll buss the right brains
Boy look, nigga don't play no games no mo
Niggas a buss ya head if you bang they ho

[Chorus - Juvenile 2x]
I heard about that money, that's some nice change
For the right price, we'll buss the right brains
Boy look, nigga don't play no games no mo
Niggas a buss ya head if you bang they ho

[Lil Pete]
Say I heard about the money, that's some nice change
For the right price i'll buss the right thang
See I ain't playing
My nigga don't play no games no mo
We just sit back and plot and load up the ammo
Cause this a kick doe
So bitch lay it down
Fill a nigga with rounds fo fuckin round
Knock down yo mound, you temptin me
Bumpin yo gums, flexin bout yo jewelry
Ya wannabe, its bout to be a tragedy
I catch em slippin while he rollin in his Bentley
Fo sheezy my neezy, I'm off da meter
P.T. and this little nigga, Little Peter
I grab tha millimeter
Yeah, that heater heater
I put money down hope to see they hit the fuckin doe
And ain't no lookin back
I'm dressed in all black
Ready for combat
I heard about that change

[Chorus - Juvenile 2x]
I heard about that money, that's some nice change

[P.T.]
I heard about that money, that's some nice change
Fo the right price, i'll buss the right brains
I scoop em up like a muthafuckin hurricane
I'm shottin him, her and everything
Cocaine distribution got me ridin fo you
On my way to da Nolia
Bout to roll on dem souljas
And then its mississippi
Then its Alabama
I-20
Atlanta
Pimp this bird wit bout 15 birds
Ride through Promise U. to get served
23 a ki. and you ain't gotta shop with me
I'm catchin mine from the sea
It's P.T. That's why I keep a .44
Nigga a buss ya head if you band his ho
Yo
But i'm too deep in this game
Yeah pussy nigga
You done heard bout that change
