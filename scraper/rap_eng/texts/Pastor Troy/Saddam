[Intro]
Yeah. Spent a long time watching the game
Come to find out them bustas is lame

SADDAM HUSSEIN
And even though they wanna stop my reign
I don't think that they can contain
SADDAM HUSSEIN

And though they wanna take my life from me
I don't think them muthaf**kas can see
SADDAM HUSSEIN

I Live by the gun die by the same thang
Time bomb tickin won't bust until ya push it

[Chorus:]
And im buckin on em
Im wylin on em
Im crankin on em
Im growlin on em
Im stuntin on em
Im flashin on em
Im flexin on em
Im cashin on em
Im leanin on em
Im dreamin on em
Im checkin on em
Im tekkin on em
Im cleanin on em
Im gleamin on em
Im snappin on em
Im trappin on em
Im sixin on em
Im pissin on em
Im dining on em
Im shining on em
Im candy on em
Im fancy on em
KEEP DAT PISTOL HANDY ON EM

[Verse 1]
I ain't bout ta reintroduce myself
Bust that K set it off to the left
Hit em in the lungs got a nigga first breath
Let that mothaf**ka hang ima sentence him to death
Neva been the one just to bite my tounge
Love this gangsta shit where im from
Two two trey got a nigga on the run
Lemme tell ya somthin son ain't no runnin from the gun
A2 you get bruised u get popped
Won't be the first mothaf**ka I shot
16 niggaâ€¦head count'll go pop
With tha infared beams sittin mean on the top
Gimmie my props gimmie my rank
I been in the army im ready to tank
Take heed to these words that I bomb
U don't wanna f**k with me Saddam

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Slide off in my six nigga
I don't want yo bitch nigga
Hoes been wantin' me for too long
Love this gangsta shit that im on
Ridin on chrome heavy foot
What else can she do but look
Coogied up from head to toe
Keep me a coupla stacks at the floor
Back to the floor ain't I nice
Play with the cash and u playin with ya life
And anyone that u choose ya still lose
And then ima tax on them mothaf**kin dues
I do it for the blues I do it for the bloods
F**k the feds and f**k the judge
Im about to drop a bomb nigga
Watch out for saddam nigga

[Chorus]
