(Pastor Troy)
I'm in a 98' Coup Deville
Gleamin like a motherfucking Bellery Cheville
My mind on my mill, these hoes on the grill
I tell 'em I'm a boss, and then they check the frost
These niggas lookin lost, these hoes lookin puzzled
Because I got me 5 bad hoes in my shuttle
And then they all cuddle, they love each other
Yeah you right, I'm a bad motherfucker
Supreme ass hustla, from the city of the A
And if it ain't pimpin, then its motherfuckin yay
Well okay, well uhuh, and all that pimp shit
Need me a bitch to buss the rent with
What's up baby?
Thats yo Benz?
Them yo girls?
Thats yo friends?
Its all cool, I'm with my folks too
Lookin for somethin to get into, a cold world

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
Damn I'm cold, I'm freezin
Damn I'm cold, a cold nigga

(Pastor Troy)
Yeah, as I was saying, baby I'm boss playin
So why don't me and you just hit the town?
Ever met a king? Ever seen a crown?
Ever let a real ass nigga take you down?
Crazy as it sounds, ooh, that maybe what you need
I'm Pastor Troy, that's John Reed
My Uncle JB, and thats my Uncle Ice
And thats my Uncle Money, baby, mac life
And thats my nigga Nature though he needs no introduction
Shit everybody know 'em, for years he been hustlin
We cut out the struggling a long time ago
Been big bang Tucker for as long as I know
Shit me and my bro nigga, the older and the younger
Went to play bumper cars in some Hummers
And that ain't no boss ass shit, I'll show ya some
And yeah I think I'm all that bitch, I done won
A cold ass nigga, I be flyin to the brawl
Pasta nigga, baby callin for the law
All my dogs tell them hoes play they roles
Pastor Troy, nigga brrrrrr, ice cold

[Chorus] - 2X
