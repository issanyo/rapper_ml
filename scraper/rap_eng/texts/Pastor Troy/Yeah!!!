Verse 1
How can I explain this game?
Got me on the road everyday, to fill my name
Me and my dreams of gettin the world crunk
The hits bring bling, and do the ATL stomp, this thang real
I got the gun chill, cranberry's and x pills
Smokin on the best of the best
When you see me you know i'm fresh
In the black lambo, I ain't ridin there hoe
Probably roll my other up, tell them what, I don't give a fu**
Prince's cut, round my neck, round my wrist, in my ear
In my son ear, in his mama ear, crystal clear
Listen hear, this fo all yall ni**az bitin' my flow
Wanna come up in the game, I can't stand a mane actin like I don't know

Yeah!!!, There's been a whole lotta talkin, Pastor Troy ni**a, where my motherfu**in offerin?
Yeah!!!, It's a whole lotta bitin', tell them ni**az keep motherfu**in fightin
Yeah!!!, It's a whole lotta suspicion, about who i'm fu**in, about who i'm hittin
Yeah!!!, Baby give me why ya can't, cause I ain't playin with ya this year man(well ah haaaa)

I been watchin these ni**az from a fog
My best friend left me with some dope in his car
So now I been hesitant to roll with the crowd

I represent ni**az smokin dro', actin wild(ya feel me now?)
I been bouncin, ever since the 9 dro
Money, cars, clothes, hoes, 17 years old...
Hop in the club with no I.D., no ni**a here is gonna try me, zone 1, 2, 3 r e s p e c t
V.I.P, bout 20 deep, hardest nigga in the street
Tryin to find me a bi*** I can check
Probably be the bitch on the deck
Better yet, i'ma slap a bi*** ass ni**a, a fu** ass ni**a, ol bitin ass ni**a

Yeah!!!, it's a whole lotta talkin, Pastor Troy ni**a, where my motherfu**in offerin?
