All my niggas, where ya stay?
Westside to Decatur, ah hey-ya, fuck ya wooden eight
I lay you down if I got a thirty-shot in my Impala
I'm a 3rd bred Bankhead, Roll Park scholar
House with no father, school - why bother?
That's why I call myself the King of the South
Well nigga, ah you don't want what I'm break out the house
Ah so I, strongly suggest you keep my name out ya mouth
Before I, be in ya house tapin ya spouse to the couch
And put a, hole in her blouse, I don't play young nigga
Remember me from back in the day young nigga
One more thing, fuck what you done heard 'bout Atlanta
We finna break the standards, rubber bands instead of platinum
I'm a hustler, not a rapper
We gangstas, y'all some actors
We finna turn this chapter, your spot is what I'm after
I'm serious!!

On all who attempt, intentions we blast-un

[Sean Paul]
I gut 'em, I roll 'em, I smoke 'em, and I pass 'em
I serve 'em, deliver, walk up on 'em and blast 'em
I'm strong but my niggas, I'm takin they cash home
Then hit the track and get rid of the whole bomb
Cuz I'm serious nigga, you gon' feel this nigga
Got a, trunk full of work, how you gon' kill this nigga?

If all fail we can 1-0-5 grill this nigga
I'm dead serious
