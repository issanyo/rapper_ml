[Hook 2x]
Oxy oxy Oxycotton oxy Oxycotton
Oxy oxy oxycotton oxy oxycotton
Oxy oxy oxycotton
Take one of these pills they get you high for real

[Verse 1]
Come on Juicy take two Oxycontins go on and get fooled
A gallon of crown will wash it down you'll be downtown snappin rolls
All you gotta do is chill it's only two lil pills
Call me in an hour let me know exactly how you feel
Oxys get up in ya like some venom
It can have you tweakin up 10, 15, 20 hours mutherfuckin geekin
Over the weekend get some sleep and you'll snap back in a couple of days
Don't be trippin your brain is rippin its okay to be afraid
Just don't get addicted it's like synthetic heroin
If you mix it with liquor you will get your scare on
Don't end up in the waffle house at 5 in the morning
You gon' be pukin up your guts in a couple of minutes and I warned ya

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2 (Juicy J)]
It's 4 in the mornin' let me see what Juice is up to {ring} (hello?)
What up? (Man fuck you!)
Okay I guess Juice is not doin to well
He just cussed me out he must be high as fuckin hell
I tried to tell him he didn't know what he was fuckin with but he insisted
I just can't believe he actually let me get him twisted
He knew who he was fuckin with he produced the first one bitch
Even Lord Infamous took two and ended up ridin' through a ditch
And I ain't playin' when I say that these muthafucka's will kill you
They're proscribed to cancer patients but I got some here to deal ya
This is oxycotton part II you've waited for this song
And I was so high when I first wrote it I didn't know I spelt it wrong muthafucka
