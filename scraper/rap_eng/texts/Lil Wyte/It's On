(Intro - DJ Paul)
Ohhh that fool got some coco puffs, boy
Damn, shit right here all gucci wit me
Kno what im sayin
Its rainin like a foo

(Chorus - Lil Wyte)
Its on!
Its on!
Time to stack these dollas
I got a couple of birds
In the back of the Impala
The Blackberrys on
You know the numba HOLLA
I drop it in the hood
And they hit it out for dollas

Its on!
Its on!
Time to stack these dollas
I got a couple of birds
In the back of the Impala
The Blackberrys on
You know the numba HOLLA
I drop it in the hood
And they hit it out for dollas

(Verse 1 - Lil Wyte)
I got cheese ho
And a bunch of f**kin coke
Waitin on a phone call
So i can go tranport
Blackberry rings:
"What up foo whatchu need?"
I need some for $600 dollas
"Ok where you wanna meet?"
Got the destination
Im ridin low-key in a scuffler junt
Creepin dirty crack the window
Cuz Im smokin on a blunt
Headin through the north-north
Side of the city streetz
Cocked the pistol
Cuz its killas hungry hidin in the trees
They hit it out for dollas
Sometimes they go bizerk
But I dont give a f**k
Why? Im gettin rid of work
Phone neva off
All they gotta do is holla
Im so on
Im so on
Im so on that its time to stack these dollas
Mothaf**ka!

Its on!
Its on!
Time to stack these dollas
I got a couple of birds
In the back of the Impala
The Blackberrys on

You know the numba HOLLA
I drop it in the hood
And they hit it out for dollas

Its on!
Its on!
Time to stack these dollas
I got a couple of birds
In the back of the Impala
The Blackberrys on
You know the numba HOLLA
I drop it in the hood
And they hit it out for dollas

(Verse 2 - Lil Wyte)
I be sittin in the driveway
Countin stacks of cheese
And in under only 2 hours
I made close to 3 G's
Got more blow in the truck
And the Impala 6 feet away from me
Thats why the AR-15s on the pssenger seat
And I dont play games with my money
Either you have it or you dont
If its a G you'll lose your finger
But for 10 Ill cut ya throat
Thats why I dont like frontin dope
How you gunna sell it and snort it?
I ain't had a grain up my nose
Thats why my pockets are knotted
So put some money in em
As if they was a slot machine
There so many feinds out here
Not-knowin anything they can stop the creme
Im Lil Wyte
And Im gunna get them bitches where they be at
With 20/20 vision
It int hard for me to see that

Its on!
Its on!
Time to stack these dollas
I got a couple of birds
In the back of the Impala
The Blackberrys on
You know the numba HOLLA
I drop it in the hood
And they hit it out for dollas

Its on!
Its on!
Time to stack these dollas
I got a couple of birds
In the back of the Impala
The Blackberrys on
You know the numba HOLLA
I drop it in the hood
And they hit it out for dollas
