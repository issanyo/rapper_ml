Well, I've been tripping for ten hours
On three hits of liquid microdot
I'm on acid
Man, what's this suppose to do to us anyway man?

Getting chased around the car
By some midgets in the parking lot
I'm on acid
Hey, is that midget coming over here?

Eating doritos through a tree
A million spiders after me
I'm on acid
Oh come on, I bet you can't eat just one

I'm running around having a fit
On myself I'm 'bout to shit
I'm on acid
Man, I gotta get to a toilet Dogg

Could you imagine feeling all confident
All of a sudden your fingers get

Please stop freezing
What is the season?
Where are we at?
And why are we leaving?

Trees are shrinking, turning past the roots
And roots back into season
Clouds are changing coming at me
Different directions now I'm freaking

Toes are raking, body shaking
Man I thought it was some crack
Called the fire department
Told them I had a flame up on my back

This is crazy busting able
Raisons dancing on the table
There's a horse we gotta horse
Yeah, we do and I've seen the stable

Quit your flogging, I ain't flogging
Gotta be then who you talking to?
I'm talking to you talking to me listen
'Cause if you and I have to be kinda smart to even catch
That I might be tripping but the pimpin', grippin' gotta spit that

With no expecticy I made a party from a robbery
Accidently kicked and tripped the thief when he had ran by me
Fuck police we gonna send this district into LSD

Take this shot of purple microdot
You will be gone a week

20/20 vision blurred
And can't even feel the syrup
I'm on acid
Man, I can't believe this stuff is stronger then that syrup

I can smoke a pound of dro
Drink myself under the floor
I'm on acid
I can't even feel none of these beers man my eyes ain't real

Put the straw up to your nose
Take the blow straight to your dome
I'm on acid
Don't even mess with that snort Dogg, I'm trippin'

Your passing on in my front yard
Throwing up off zanex bars
I'm on acid
Look like you took about one two many of them pills

Well, I'm wishing I was sober
Feel the shit from head to shoulders
This ain't even half way over
It's the part I'm waiting to show ya

Laughing long time like Hyenas
Laugh a long time at mienas
In the can or out the can
They still look like a can of peanuts

I'm the meanest acid taker
Down south cracker on the mike
Chainsaw crankin', gotcha thinking
Good trick gone turned to a fright

Bubble popping, trails are watching
From across the fucking room
A dog came in the den and made a mess
And then asked for the broom

Now I'm 'bout to hit the sack
'Cause I can't take this shit no more
Relax my mind, take a deep breath
And let my head sink in pillow

Take a seven hour nap, wake up seven minutes later
It's the greatest drug the 70's has ever fucking gave us
Yes it's major, don't be playing when you drop it, it will hit ya
If it's gel caps or liquid microdots, yes I'm with ya

And I'm flipping cross the row
Visual contact, lighting glow
The spaceship I'm flying landed in the bay
I have to go

By now I'm weak, in some pain
And my bodies feeling drained
I'm on acid
Man, I feel like a can even walk no more

Coming down off of my trip
And my skins about to rip
I'm on acid
I can feel my hands hurting

I'll probably sleep till Thursday
And it's only Sunday
I'm on acid
I can't wait to hit my bed man

Waking up on that Thursday
To have another Saturday
I'm on acid
Man, I can't wait till I pass some more of that shit
