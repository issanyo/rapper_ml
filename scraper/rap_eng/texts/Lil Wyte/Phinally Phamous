(Lil Wyte)
I'm slummed out right now, that ain't no suprize
Dilated pupils seein doubles out of both my eyes
I hit up a little spark, got 'em for no charge, and f**k with his boy
Zanex bars call 'em totem poles or even tonka toys
I popped half and then popped the other half and hit the crown
Then put my shot glass down and poured another round
I'm starting to fill everything I just put into my body
Liquor and the bars got me right though I might look retarded
Get up out my way little quicka with the K
Even though I'm f**ked up I'ma still maintain
Got sumthin in my brain like do damn thang
Like tell the same mayne's ass soft insane
I'ma monsta when I'm high specially on some bars
Don't need to cop lyrically can catch a charge
Runnin down the street yellin f**k the police
With Reeboxs on my feet high on 4 more bars
I'ma hold my crown and I'ma rep my Memphis pop my pills, smoke all my deeros
Be f**ked up fall out in public fallin out on crackers and negros
Ho you think you know Lil Wyte I'm telling you rightcha now
You hold out I'ma find out better pull 'em out and pass them sticks around

(Chorus)
Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you

Totem poles, Candy bars, even Yellow ladders
Tonka toys, White sticks it don't really matter
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you
If you got 'em pass that shit around I want to look like you

(Lil Wyte)
One little pill you can break down into fo's
Guaranteed when mixed with liquor it gone have on the flo'
Take advantage of the power the sticks put off every hour
Try to over do it you gone find yourself off in the shower
This is not some powder the effects are completely differant
You are not a coward if you pop one and get scared of the shit
You might forget what you did the night before if you want 'em
Better get somebody to be witcha only if they ass is sober
Gotta keep my f**kin brain on chicken lane change only if the beat bang
I'll be able to do my thang no what I got to do know why I gotta rock
F**ked up or not I'ma take this shit to the top
If you see me in the streets betta believe me this cracker is off the hezzy
Memphis, Tennessee is my stopping ground and zanex bars just went down in me
This weed in me and Henessey all over my academics T
Was f**ked up and doubled in for shit but fallin up out the S-U-V
They serious don't play with 'em if you can't handle 'em come my way
We'll rock 'em to the BAY and we'll deal 'em up on the slang
When I bump my female in an all night bang with a BIOTCH!

(Chorus)
