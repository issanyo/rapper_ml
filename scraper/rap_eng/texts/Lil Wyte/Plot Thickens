[Verse 1]
Surrounded by stoners, alcoholics, and pill poppas
A product of my environment still I built off her
The percentage rate of me doin' any of this shit is
Slim 2 nun but I understand every motherfucking bit of it
The name W.Y.T.E. alone is in the know
And I have children that will spread my knowledge long after I go
And if I don't get a chance to write whatever it is that I'm tryin' to say
Tho prolly let it be clear 10 times in 20 different ways
On ya road to success destruction will lie in ya path
Even a bite from a snake in the grass can leave ya gaspin'
High steppin' round this muthafuka
Failure not an option
Cut they head off keep walkin'
Don't look back jus finish talkin'

(Chorus)
I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot

I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot

I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot

[Verse 2]
And I got some stories that I can't put in rap form
An its for good reason
MPD tryin' to crack a case on me for like for 24 seasons
They ain't never gonna catch me with my hands dirty
Killers on my payroll, they won't ever tell ya heard me
I gotta tight circle no knots in my rope
I swear to god the first one to lose focus gets a knife to throat
I'm sic of bein' a nice guy they bout to feel the weapon
They don't understand that they only reason
Hey still breathings cause I let em
Boss Wyte believe in karma but I'm so close to satan
Fuck em with a dick I got five racks to get em out my way
No I'm jus kiddin' I got bigger plans for those
I gotta all access pass to hell and I will personally visit them hoes to let em know

(Chorus)
I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot

I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot

I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot

[Verse 3]
And you ain't help me out then
Then why the fuck would ya start now
I had a tragedy happen to me
You were no where to be found
I pick myself up off the ground, started mobbin' harder than before
I'm not the type to look back
I keep my head straight and go

No soul on the planet could imagine my pain
I got scars in my memory bank that bleed on my brain
And I will never forgive n e negativity brought my way
I got shooters in the bay
That's been waitin' on me to say
Get em

Get em now but make watch they own death
Meanwhile I thickin' the plot, til I am on my last breath
An I ain't been thru everything yet
But for now I keep it movin'
Stayin' on my job stakin' my bread
What the fuck is you doin'?

(Chorus)
I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot

I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot

I ain't been thru everything, but I done seen alot
Friends became bitches wit some homies I forgot
If I can tell em anything then I prolly would not
I got betta shit to do like finish thickinin' the plot
