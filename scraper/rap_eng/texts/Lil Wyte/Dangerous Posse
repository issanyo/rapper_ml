[Intro: DJ Paul]
The most dangerous posse song ever
It's going down, Hypnotize Camp Posse
You did this nigga, shit talkin
You wanna talk about something nigga
Talk about how many hoes, clothes and bank rolls we got
Who we got in here: Juicy J, Lil Wyte, Frayser Boy, Crunchy Black
Lord Infamous and me DJ Paul the King of Memphis

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Nigga we some maniacs, fuckin up our brainiacs
Breakin down some dope, wit a razor boy remember that
Vodka mix with Smilak, take a gun and cock it back
Now I'm bout to blow my brains out cause I dont give a shat
Hope you give a nigga reason to wet ya, the bigger gun the better
The more shit you talk, the more blood the sweater
The plane crashes, the devil, the anthrax, the letters
Forgot about the peddlers, we still in it together

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
Let me introduce myself, my fuckin nigga
I'mma be the one to pull that fuckin trigga
I'mma be the one that's sent to fuckin getcha
You better watch out cause I'll paint a picture
A pretty little picture now how a nigga getcha
Lock you in the trunk and take care of my business
Paul and Juicy sent me so you know its big business
C.B. nigga ain't leavin no witness

[Bridge: DJ Paul]
Yeah, make me a believer nigga
Make some shit this bumpin you fuckin wannabes, Lord roll!

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
I am the predator you are the prey
You play the target, Lord play the gauge
You play bitches and I mack hoes
You run from niggas, I find the snub nose
I come from Three 6 bitch, a platinum clique
And you can't sell three copies of your shit
You smoke babbage weed and cheap packs of blow
You own a vehicle, pick up the Scarecrow

[Verse 4: Frayser Boy]
Frayser Boy, cockin toy, y'all dont wanna fuck with me
Infared got ya scared, in protective custody
The Unbreakables, the most hateable, the unescapeables
Time to bust a nigga head, we arent hesitateable
Ya chest pumped out, mouth talking that shit
I'm from the Bay, I'ma show you how a nigga beat a bitch
Time to damage shit, no understandin this, you know you scandalous
HCP blowin your lights out like a candle bitch

[Verse 5: Lil Wyte]
Well I'm about to rip a hole in the industry, holdin' my energy
Wasn't about to let it out but y'all had to come testin me
Givin you one warning change your name before I get your crunk
Lyrically copyrighted all my shit and plus I'll fuck you up
You dont want to have to cross the path of killers when you on the streets
HCP got WYT to the E and thats just how it be
Quit ya muthafuckin hatin playin all your petty games
If you wanted to ride my nuts that bad you should've asked me mane

[Verse 6: DJ Paul]
Danger
You muthafuckas wanted a war bitch then ima bring it on
Catch you in these fuckin streets boy and ima point the chrome
Put you in the fuckin car ho, and we gon take you home
To hell with all that cryin now nigga we gonna get it on
Beat you with that yawk dead center across your damn dome
The way you ran your mouth, you shouldve known to have the fuckin tone
Beggin from beginning, man winnin cause our camp is strong
The same way your skull started dentin cause we beat it long
You niggas swear you have the right plan but you had the wrong mans
Tryin to build a clique like the hypnotize camp
Im knowin it wouldn't work so I just sit back
And watch how the trains just runs off the track
Cause it be to many loses, to many boses
Too many niggas thats wantin they own office
You niggas gotta realize who got the city owned
Three 6 fuckin Mafia, not these damn clones
