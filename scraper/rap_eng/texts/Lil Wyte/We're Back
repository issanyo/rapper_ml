[Hook: Jelly Roll & Lil Wyte]
Someone said that I was down, someone said that I was broke
Someone said I was the shit, someone said that I fell off
Well I tell em all we back bitch
I tell em all we back bitch
Someone said we couldn't rap, someone said we was a joke
Someone said that we was crack, someone said that we was smoke
Tell em all we back bitch
Yea tell em all we back bitch

[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
Hey what they look at me for?
Aye give them boys a detour
This KL need more shells inside they hood than the seashore
Aye this my Aqua Fina flow, I'm talkin bout that water
While speakin of that water I'm out here with the piranhas
Man I put that on my mama
I shoulda said my mammies
At 15 years old we're sellin wammies at my granny
I came up outta nothing, I mean nothing at all
Forgive me if I hit the club and I just don't fuckin ball
Yea, me and Little Wyte, rap game is a rep
Sometimes family will fight
But they always come back
So just forgive me every time that I spoke out of emotion
But you know like I know
This rap game's a rollercoaster
But I rap

Someone said that we was crack, someone said that we was smoke
Tell em all we back bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
This right here is a power move
Me and Jelly back on the track
So get real and ya'll know how we do
Tearin up, every big city and we are the Caucasian wreckin crew
What it do? I'm high and drunk
Going all the way in the night
Not that I was going with a back foot bone
And I'll really get it even if we got a fight
It's Lil Wyte, I've always been on
I ain't for this life, so rich for tone
Going broke is a motherfuckin problem
And I've been on, jump on hoes bones
Me and brother made amends
We got back in the lab, on shit again
Picked up them pens in order down it
Get us some dividends
It's money tree, don't never stop going down the track
Screaming and smoking
Numb in the back with a flip of OG white kush and I'm rollin and choking
I've been around this hoe before and I'm back to fuck the bitch one more time
It's Jelly Roll with Lil Wyte, No Filter and this is the devil that's in the ground
