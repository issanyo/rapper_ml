[Intro: Jelly Roll]
All the drinkin and smoking
I don't even know what I've been doin, where I'm goin
Life is like a movie but somehow I just keep flowin
I'm losin focus
I'm feelin hopeless
Let's go

[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
I woke up this morning smoking that green
Think about money and sippin that lean
Sellin that white, turnin up beans
I'm damaged, selling everything
Man, this is awesome, I do this often
Fillin my chest and I started to cough
I'm not stopping til I'm in a coffin
Still sellin cheap like we're all in a auction
Killin them guys and killin no lie
Way before rap I was sellin them pies
Lookin at me you can tell that I grind
Thinkin I'm broke, get the hell out yo mind
Hold up, hold up
Man, let me slow it down
Too stoned, now let's roll the loud
Hit the city, rolling round

[Hook: Jelly Roll]
And all we do is get fucked up
All we do is get fucked up
We just ride around and get fucked up
All we do is get fucked up
All we do is smoke a little green, party all the time
Only thing we know is keep that money on our mind
And we get fucked up, get fucked up
All we do is get fucked up, get fucked up

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
Woke up this morning, holler that roll
I ain't got shit to do today bro
All I really need is a plain ticket
To the ville and I'm about the dough
Crank up the yo, gather some hoes
Roll up the dro and find me some lean
G-Pen full of hash wax, I'm blitzed
Now let's go hit the fuckin scene
OG white in the building hoe
Bitch you better not blow my buzz
Roll my cause, wuddup Dre?
Now you know why, know how you does
Walking six in the hotel room
Party hard like Montley Crue
White music, we got money
Get fucked up and that's all we do
Rock star life, I might not make it
All day long now white boy wasted
Just pop and vent it boy
Ground rules how I like to chase it
Get your way back up in this bitch
Well smoking real, drink all your weed
Take you later, put her on her knees
That's how we do it here in Tennessee

[Hook]

[Outro: Jelly Roll]
All the drinkin and smoking
I don't even know what I've been doin, where I'm goin
Life is like a movie but somehow I just keep flowin, I'm losin focus
I'm feelin hopeless
Let's go
