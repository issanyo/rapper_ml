(Lil Wyte - Talking)
Wassup with y'all?
I'ma take this time right now, to thank the men, Paul and Juicy
For making all this possible you know what I'm sayin'?
When you comin' from the bay, alot of things don't seem like they can't happen in life
You just gotta put effort into it, you know what I'm sayin'?
H.C.P we fixin' to rock this, we did it again, you know what I'm sayin'?

(Crunchy Blac)
Let me tell you a lil' somethin' real
Around here a nigga tryina get them a meal
Climb that hill like jack and jill
But when I need to climb a nigga still keep it real
Fuck they way you other nigga feel
I'ma put a bullet in ya ass fo real
So push on nigga cause you'll never get a deal
Fuckin' with us yeah you'll get cha self killed
Get cha self killed

(Fraysier Boy)
Suckers run up to get beat down
Never in the public unless I got my fucking heat round
Niggas got some problems leave you bitches underneath ground
Oh no you niggas didn't think a muthafucka weak now
Niggas tryina chill I ain't with that fuckin' cross shit
Fraysier Boy'll leave yo pussy ass in the trunk bitch
Hypnotize Minds muthafucka ya we done this
Prayin' I don't have to kill a nigga over dumb shit

(Lord Infamous)
Lord Infamous the mercendary lethal lyrical butcher
Mafia so general gang member and pusher
Livin' legend in Memphis hood project is slum
Fresh hit a (blay) then you hear the spray from the tommy gun
Body goes numb and ya eye lids close
From the lead over dose when I split cha kinda low
Cause my trigger finger only do nothing but squeeze
I'ma shoot ya bitch ass everywhere but under your feet

(DJ Paul)
I swear alot of niggas blame me for shit I ain't got shit to do with
Nigga show it and prove it
I always heard my CD wasn't big enough for a royce
But I ain't believe until we bought a couple of them hoes
When you was style you gotta watch what you do
Cause niggas look for the smallest reasons to point fingers at you
They want so bad for somebody to come up over the 6
You better hurry up boy I'm 20 years in this shit, BITCH

(Juicy J)
Juicy J yes I'm that nigga
Smokin' all the weed and I'm drankin' all the liquor
A nigga always strapped I gots to get mine
Nigga tell yo bitch quit waistin' my time
Fuck these wanna be thugs ain't never did crime
Nigga workin' for the feds and droppin' them dimes
I don't fuck with you bitches don't mess with yo kind
You can stay on yo corner and sniff on yo line (NIQQA)

(DJ Paul - Talking)
You better hurry the fuck up if your going to do what I did nigga
Plaqs all over the muthafuckin' place, movies
Uthafuckin' houses every muthafuckin' where
You better hurry up
And to you bitch ass niggas supporting them you better
Super muthafuckin' hurry up and help these niggas out
Cause when somebody do take my muthafuckin' place
You muthafuckas going to be to muthafuckin' old to see it bitch
Hurry the fuck up nigga

(Lil Wyte)
I woke up early to see the sunrise right across from outta of my eyes
Let me see these haters clearly whenever I stop down the drive by
I am a dramatic, most static addict, a rehab with automatic
Doubt me now I made it, phinally phamouse bout to let you have it
This is not a game kin fold game not playin' with ya
Gotta brang the slangs ?? ain't gone paint yo picture
Some of the story we can tell it's just bout a communication
The shit you take turn the head all over the nation
I been waitin' for vacations and the money that I'm makin'
Muthafuckas hatin' now that I'm on they times
Waisted I'ma do it for the bay and for my children and the war
And let these non believers know that we all been here before
Reality don't exsist like ?? dream, quote, Johnny Wide miss him bad may he rest in peace
A livin' legend is what ya lookin' at and will now crown
If nobody else does I will make sure Memphis is standing out
