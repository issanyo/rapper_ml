[Verse 1 Lil Wyte]
Mothafucka my name is Lil Wyte
Breakin out the frame supertight
I got some to say and I might
Express myself clearly damn right
Cuz I've been makin this music and
I've been getting this cheese
All these record companies still doubt me
But one of these days they gon see
Me standin on the top lookin down
I dont need your handouts right now
Im at the top of my game
With connections to shut you out
And Im with Hynotized Minds
And I fuck the Therapy
A-sizzle, White Boyz,? and my big homie Big-E
And I forget about gettin green
????????
This years my year 2007
And Im gunna dominate the scene
I got some real shit up my sleeve
I got some good kush in my lungz
I got that brown liquor in my stomach
And acid drops on my tounge...

Yeah!!!
