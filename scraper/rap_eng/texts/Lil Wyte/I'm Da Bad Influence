[Chorus 2x]
I'm da bad influence
(I'm) I'm da bad influence [3x]
I smoke all night and I sleep all day
I don't give a fuck about what none of y'all say

[Verse 1]
I roll dro up I fuck a bad bitch
I get that dough bra thanks to three 6
M' town representative been putting it down
Way before you puff your first blunt or take that shot of crown
I am legend dawg A.K.A. the real McCoy
A.K.A. the cracka that sticks out a track and will destroy
Gotta be here for a purpose I know the listeners are nervous
All they thinkin 'Is he white?' I hope this doesn't reach the surface
But I'm gon' get it come hell or high water
Now that Pac Biggie and Pimp and conversate with my father
The roads open and I've always had the map to the treasure
Why you think my fans call me during desperate measures bitch

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
I got a master plan, in the works, pick investors with the perks
When I make ten million I'm gon' turn into a fuckin jerk
If you liked the old me, too bad, I'm 'bout to kill him off
Then go overseas and make a hundred mill' with David Hasselhoff
And I make the Baywatch to show 'em what they have created
Getting' money that don't look like ours is how you know you've made it
When I reach I touch the fuckin sky, every time hoe
The shit I teach is deep its more than just a fuckin rhyme hoe
I am the bad influence, the one that's tellin' you do it
Like your conscience, only I got way more pain relievin' fluid
I'm a little fuckin dro'd, I'm a lot fuckin throwed
And I like my fans to join along whenever I'm rockin' out they shows

[Chorus 2x]
