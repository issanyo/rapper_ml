When I come for you now
I be looking for liquor
Rollin bad bitches weed and swishers
I'm the man that'll lick your girlfriend up and down and then I'll dick her
Better run to Memphis
Little bit of pimpin
Out of my system
So I gotta spit it
Ridin with a six bitch
Then we're gonna get this
It's goin 'round thats no bullshit
Wyte music riders
I'm beside ya and we're gonna wile out till the end
I'm not just the leader of the pack of pill poppin, drinkin train
Lets go party, meet me by the bar
I'll have a quadruple crown and coke
Cause I like to drink
And I like to roll
And I like to sip
And I like to smoke
You know who I am
I'm W, Y, T to the E
And I'm ready to get it started
We can kick it untilthe sun comes up and all of us look retarded
We gonna buy the bar tonight
Jellyroll, pass me one of them totem poles
Let's get us fucked up tonight and I'll show you all how I roll
