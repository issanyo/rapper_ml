[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
Pardon me, I'm kinda plastered
I've been drinkin' since noon (Are you for real?)
So forgive me, I just need a little room
'Cause at any given minute I might fuck around and throw up
Then hop inside my pickup, hit the lot and go do donuts (Skrrt)
Fuck the police so what, hey grab that weed and roll up (Hold up)
Ask me what my name is, I'll probably tell em I'm tore up
Hold up, hold up, I really mean it, hold up (Hold up)
I told that bitch to pull me through, kinda like a tow truck
My homie on that lean, he's swayin' like a rocker (Rocker)
And now he's movin' slower than a granny with a walker (Ha ha)
I told that bitch to come here (Come here)
I really need a driver (I need a driver)
And then I told her treat my dick like a breathalyzer, I'm drunk

[Chorus: Lil Wyte]
I smoke beer (I smoke beer)
Drink weed (Drink weed)
Ride around singin' fuck the police (Police)
I sip pills (Sip pills)
Pop lean (Pop lean)
Ride around singin' fuck the police (Police)

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
Alright I'm fucked up and I know it (How you know it?)
Shit, I'm stumblin', thinkin' I'm spittin', pimpin' to this bitch
But I'm just (mumblin')
I had an idea, I can get this hoe to my room and make her squirt
All I need is weed to drink and beer to smoke and Usher, what
Keepin' up with me is tough, I always go hard, I'm never goin' home
I'm crashin' out on the studio couch, tonight on Crown, leave me alone
I'm in my zone and I'm feelin' it
High or drunk, it don't matter, I'm killin' shit
The name is Lil Wyte if you didn't know by now
Might take your liquor and weed and steal your bitch
Don't give a fuck who, fuck the police too
Must be my Memphis Tennessee attitude
I'ma cool motherfucker I'm just actin' rude
I got no class to put me in a bad mood
I'm a little bit ratchet and trippy at all times (Trippy)
I'm turnt up to the max these ain't just rhymes
I'm on my Juicy J shit (Shut the fuck up)
It's been 30 o'clock (Uh huh) and that's the perfect time

[Chorus: Lil Wyte]
I smoke beer (I smoke beer)
Drink weed (Drink weed)
Ride around singin' fuck the police (Police)
I sip pills (Sip pills)
Pop lean (Pop lean)
Ride around singin' fuck the police (Police)
Popcorn

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
I pull up to the club bumpin' country music (Music)
Them people look at me like I was really fuckin' stupid (I am)
I'm ridin' 'round drunk listenin' to Jason Aldean (My kinda party)
Sippin' on that purple shit and smokin' on that Al Green (Woo)
Much as I've been drinkin', man I ain't even thinkin' (Ain't thinkin')
I told this bitch that my dick was smaller than my pinky (Ha ha ha)
Don't know what I was thinkin' (What)
But maybe I could pull her (Pull her)
And then I told the bitch to grab a beer out of my cooler (Now)
Woo, man I'm a hilarious guy (Hilarious guy)
I might cum before I fuck like American Pie (Ahh)
Now they sayin' that I'm longer so don't cuss no more (No)
And then I tell 'em shit fuck damn (Fuck) cunt whore

[Chorus: Lil Wyte]
I smoke beer (I smoke beer)
Drink weed (Drink weed)
Ride around singin' fuck the police (Police)
I sip pills (Sip pills)
Pop lean (Pop lean)
Ride around singin' fuck the police (Police)
