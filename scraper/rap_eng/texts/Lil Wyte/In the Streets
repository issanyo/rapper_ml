[Chorus - x 2 ]
In the street I'm bout my buisness how I be a be a
If you want some work from me you pay a fee a fee a
When I check my crackhouse I'm gonna reup reup
For you robbers in the hood I throw my heat up heat up

[Verse 1]
They always be askin what is crack cocaine
Crack cocaine fries your brain
Crack cocaine keep me pocket change when I be on my slang
Keep them thangs single solid on a brick up off the house
Try to snatch my shit wit out payin I'm blowin off ya mouth
That's the way it is in up in the dope game have no respect
Don't pass wit no brains if no thangs blow some big ass checks
Straight to the liquor store thats were we roll to get my 75
Damn they close at 11 yes I'm ballin doin 99
Worked that whole week to get that cheese and give that shit to me
Bet you feelin shitty fall to sleep on the side of the street
Tell me how it feels walkin round I no whats goin on
Only thing you no is I'm the 1 supplyin all the stone
Keep my pockets swoll and I be ballin on the fuckin slab
Think you droppin sissions in my buisness take yo buisness back
Yes I roll wit dealers and my skrillas are my priority
Bitch I ride wit killas and these killas have authority

[Chorus - x 2]
In the street I'm bout my buisness how I be a be a
If you want some work from me you pay a fee a fee a
When I check my crackhouse I'm gonna reup reup
For you robbers in the hood I throw my heat up heat up

[Verse 2]
Well I ain't waistin mine, gotta get them nickels and dimes all the time
Cuz Benjimin Franklin the only mother fucker on my mind
I'm ridin to a cutless twanky threes grippin pine
And I know the junkies see me colors changin all the time
When you spot me better stop me cuz I'm not slayin long
The pigs love comin up to this white boy ridin on all this fuckin chrome
Got yo stone bitch I'm gone destination where I stay
Fraiser boy up on the side and bitch were ridin to the bay
What you talkin bout? what you askin bout? what you need from me
Check it I serve some big bags, some crack, and some ecstasy
Anything else I don't fuck wit it, or I just fuckin know
Were to find it where to get it and how far the shit will flow
Where smokers and sellers these drugs be so plentiful
But junkies will do anything for that crack mane and its pitiful
They loose there life Critical they loose there bodies shut down physical
But rock it up you get yo grip and all that there is beuitifull

[Chorus - x 2]
In the street I'm bout my buisness how I be a be a
If you want some work from me you pay a fee a fee a
When I check my crackhouse I'm gonna reup reup
For you robbers in the hood I throw my heat up heat up

[Verse 3]
It ain't no stoppin here I could keep boomin slangin dis dope
Or I could take a chance flippin this bird to a bro
But see its jus my luck po's will prolly kick in my doe
So I gotta keep lookin over my should lookin out for dem hoes
And I gotta find another location plus anohter temptation there so
Many faces and customers in this occupatin and I have no patience
And people wanna fuck wit my time thas why you be comin up short wit these
Nickles and dimes, I'm even wit mine
You get it when I get it and thas all the time
I never decline your money unless you smell outta line
And I'm feelin fine, they'll find you all tied up in some twine
My moneys importent a lil more then important then how I shine
Dont play wit that 9, you pull it use it you should abuse it mine
But see ya blind, then copyrite yo mouf wit yo mind
I'm puttin it out and givin it to ya jus how I get it
This evil is wit it wit no discussin this is how I spit it

[Chorus - x 2]
In the street I'm bout my buisness how I be a be a
If you want some work from me you pay a fee a fee a
When I check my crackhouse I'm gonna reup reup
For you robbers in the hood I throw my heat up heat up
