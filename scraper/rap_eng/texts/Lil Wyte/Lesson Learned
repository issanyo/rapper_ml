Due Talk
Sitting on the corner smoking marijuana age 12
Never thought I'd have a picture off inside the XXL
Started free styling 16 in the cafeteria
Wrote a hot 16 than all them then knew
I was serious White Boy Dinero introduced me to the Shelby Forest Click
I ended up getting on 10 of they 15 songs the shit was sick
My dad put up them cheese for us to get them press
Man I swear to god they thought we was the motherfucking best
Who knew a year later 3 6 would get a copy of it
And I'd came out with a solo deal yelling Mafia, bitch
They felt like I traded on em I was following dreams
Had a baby on the way and couldn't afford diaper, rash, and cream
So what do you think I did when I got to my crossroads
Kept on walking straight never looked back once and went with my whole soul
Though it came with the consequences, conflict interrupted
Every time we saw each other we was fighting over nothing
One day they sent a junkie to my home to do me harm
I was outta town so they commenced a beating up my mom
She had brain damage after the first blow to the head
Had to spend a couple of weeks in the hospital bed
Her condition got worse and started stressing out my dad
4 years later into all the pills he had a massive heart attack
The Dr. said he'd be ok, but you know how them things go
Now I live my life without either one of my fucking folks
Because my mother's mind is gone, she don't recognize my face
And my dad, yeah hes passed away he's in a better place
But I blame myself if I would have never signed that contract
Maybe shit would be different and I would have both of my parents back
But neither one of them wanted that, they wanted me to shine
They know I was exceptional with an extraordinary mind
So I say Thank You, to my gift and my curse
The fact they won't see the SNO album drop is what really hurts
So all the people that were involved in causing me this pain
Understand you poured gasoline in the center of my flame
And I'll keep burning till the end of time you'll never put me out
If that was your attempt to shut me up you need to choose another route
Now I'm colder than ever I got the whole world going crazy
Why you still only getting 20 people in the Daisy
I'm the man, bitch you shoulda stuck along for the ride
Wyte Music is on the rise and now my bodies full of pride
Motherfucka
