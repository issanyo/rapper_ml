[Lil Wyte]
I'm a weed fiend im a ganja junkie professional cigarillo roller future California medical marijuana card holder
Smokin all right a mini me of tommy chong
I love swisher sweets vaporizers papers bowls and bongs gettin lifted in my zone im always floatin on a cloud it pays the cost to be the boss so i deserve to puff all out

Bitch i look good and i love how i look
Blowin sour diesel bein cooked by the book
You know how we get down up in these streets, boy i smoke a lot of weed till i look chinese south side in the nap right where you find me

Eyes chinese like yo boy Yao Ming what the fuck you mean that money ain't a thang shit
Money everything man fuck a wedding ring and fuck a bitch too im on the block and beans

[Jelly Roll]
Light another spliff middle fingers to them politics
I ain`t lien bitch i smoke on that karate kid
More guns than an army man down in Pakistan
Plus i still pull my own stunts like im Jackie Chan
When they see that old chevy yeah they know its him
Big rims tires still thin as ethiopians
Jelly on that dro again, fuck it lets go again
Better not try him got that 44 with him
And every verse you ever heard was a freestyle
So high when i look down all i see is clouds
Probation trooper say they need me to pee now
Fuck it go to jail come right back up to the weed house

[Chorus]
