[Madrox]
(Man, I was so drunk last night..
I was drinking shots off this fine, young 'tender
Muthafucka, that was me..)

[Madrox]
(MONOXIDE!!)

[Monoxide]
I’m gone, buddy (what you mean you gone, buddy?)
I mean that I can’t even feel my legs like I’m froze
And I wanna get me dome
But I can’t even take her home
Wanna go to my girl keep blowin’ up my phone
I don’t give a fuck, though
Hand me a Dixie cup and a Red Bull
And I'mma mix it up with something special to make ya head go
Ooo wee ooo wee, ooo wee ooo wee ooo
I just found a fuckin’ jar of weed in my car
I be rollin’ it, smokin’ it ‘till I’m up in a coma
Hopefully I’ll control the speed
Roll the window open and get the fuck up out the way
‘Cause I got throw up in the throat again
I’m on a potion binge
Please quit all “emotionin’”
It’s fuckin’ with my focus and
I really need to see who the fuck it is I’m smokin’ with
She’s askin’ me what I wanna do, and I’m hopin’ hit
But I’m too gone for this

[Hook - All]
Poppin’ pills and eatin’ shrooms
Give me molly and 'Bou Lou
Jäger Bombs and bong rips
Vicodins and that syrup shit
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Come with us and then get undressed
See how wasted we can get
Get high, get drunk, get high
Get drunk, get high
Get WASTED!!
Puff, sip, puff, sip, puff, sip
Get WASTED!!

[Madrox]
(Yeah..
I ate all the shrooms and I drank a fifth of Jack Daniels..
I can’t feel my fucking hands..)

[Madrox]
I got a bit of Tanqueray
Little bit of Alizé
Put it in a cup and I fill it to the brim
Bottom to the skies, then I do it all again
Drink of champions, tell me who wanna get gin?
‘Cause I showed up drunk
Got a wet bar in the back of my truck
Crowne Royal, Crystal Head, Seagram’s Gin, Boone’s Farm, Cold Duck
Get ya cup and shut the fuck
We ‘bout to party up
And sip and chug and drink
‘Till somebody pass out or throw up
Bubble guts, I’m fittin' to spew
How many drinks you had tonight?
Bartender said that 32 will slur your speech and blur your sight
36 will have you super pissy looking for a fight
And 50 will leave you holdin’ the toilet, puking for dear life
I grip the grass so my ass don’t fall off the fuckin’ planet
I’m drunk as ever was drunk last and bitch don’t understand it
I can’t stand to stand up
‘Bout to piss, I’m pissy drunk
Pour the rest of my liquor up into 20 sippy cups
Sip it slow and finish up
Ain’t no quitter, listen up
Party’s paused, but it’s back on
The very second I wake up

[Hook]

[JellyRoll]
Man, I woke up still higher than fuck
Man, I must have went to sleep with a hell of a buzz
Get Twiztid with Twiztid
It was ridiculous
Went to sleep with a thick bitch
Woke up with syphilis
Nasty.. in every sense of the word
Walkin’ in the waffle house about as high as a bird
B-b-b- back up off me, ‘cause I might puke
And there ain’t no tellin’ what I might do
I’m just like you, you’re just like me
Is he on some kind of pill?
I just might be
The room spinnin’, I think it’s time to go
Give me a couple seconds, and I might blow

[Madrox]
(AJAX!!)

[Ajax]
I’m meetin’ Jerry Bears untill I’m barely there
Tripped my nuts off, landed in some chick’s derriere
Me and my hash rig make a scary pair
Stabbin’ globs on the skillet got these fairies scared
Yeah, I’m purple hash wasted
Met this junkie ho Katrina
Left the party at her man’s
She got drunk and stole the Beamer
I looked her in her eyes, said
“Get comfy.. hold the weiner”
Then we slipped through the hood
Vapin’, bumpin’ Funky Cold Medina
It’s ‘Jax, bitch

[Madrox]
(And it don’t stop!)

[Hook]

[Liquid Assassin]
Gimme a jug of that Crown
Guzzle that down
What’s the runner up?
Well I’m trippin’ on that now
I can tell by the feeling in my stomach
Any little more of something
And I’ll be slumping
I’ll be hugging that ground
Yeah, you can tell that I’m stumbling
I don’t know how to act now
Had a few too many, bugging the act out
Drunk off my ass and I ain’t fuckin’ sat down
That blurred vision
I’m on one and I’m lifted
Hit the dank mixed with that drank
Like Mad and Mono, I’m Twiztid
And I’m gone
Not contemplating one conversation
Had too much drank
Get the fuck out my face, I’m wasted

[Madrox]
(Ladies and gentlemen.. BLAZE YA DEAD HOMIE!!)

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Get basted, tipsy and wasted
Bitch, pop a molly and get naked
You can be my guest on the spaceship
We on that DMT with them aliens
Let’s get drunk, see double
Talk a little shit, I wanna start a lot of trouble
Burn trees, indeed, top speed
Wanna see everybody turning green

[Hook ]

[Madrox]
(Bottle of Moët? Check
Kilo of cocaine? Check
Box of condoms? Check)

[Bukshot]
(Bukshot)
Fuck the dumb shit
Homie let’s get wasted
Throwing down the hatchet
Watch me turn into a spaceship
(Blast off)
Sippin’ on this liquor got me lifted
(Cast off)
Talkin’ to a volley ball, I’m Twiztid
Pull a pop cup full of vodka in the console
My head hurts like Daryl hit me with the crossbow
I saw Mono passing bottles like he’s Rondo
Jamie hit the bourbon like a Savage, call him Macho
Kush in the air, roaches in the ash tray
Life ain’t fair, drinkin’ on a rampage
Cops ain’t there, so we swervin’ in the fast lane
I don’t care, slow motion like I’m Max Payne
(Bukshot)
In the murder bucket, straight loaded
Naked bad bitches in the backseat, folded
My team’s reelin', it don’t matter if they hate this
Tore up, laughing at you, bitch
We’re fucking wasted

[Hook]

[Lil Wyte]
(Hey I’m literally coming down off molly, like right now)

[Lil Wyte]
I’m in Ann Arbor, Michigan
Ratchets all around me
OG white kush got the whole room cloudy
Smelling like a pound of that shit
When we walk up in the place
Me and Trevor G
Taking gram blunts to the face
Chugging molly cocktails
I’m on my molly game shit
Fucked up at the hotel
Still there ain’t a bitch I can’t hit
Got crossed eyeballs
I can barely see where I am goin’
Got 2 Xanax bars in my body
Now my heart rate is slowin’
But I know I’ll be alright, I do this all the time
I actually live the life I rap about
In every one of these rhymes
Ask Twiztid, they’ll tell ya
I’m a crazy motherfucker
Abominationz tour every night
Lil Wyte was slightly drunker
Ha haaa..

[Madrox]
(Now hell yeah
You right Lil Wyte
Now roll the muthafuckin’ blunt
I’mma pour this muthafuckin’ Crowne
We’ll get wasted)

[Hook]

[Johnny Richter]
I hear a lot of people jibber jabber
About doin’ this or that
(Johnny Richter!)
But me, I’m only spittin’ facts
(Real knows real)
It’s Richter teaming up with Twiztid
Twistin’ nothin’ but the bidness
Getting’ lifted, we malicious
You not smokin’? That’s suspicious
Writing rhymes in hieroglyphics
Munchin’ brownies, it’s delicious
And that acid kicked that ass, kid
I’m losing my mind
But with the way I’m looking, fuck it
I’ll just cook up some more crack
Drinkin’ vodka out the bucket
Mixed with heroin and smack
Me getting’ sober? That’s hilarious
The joke of the year
Wrecked over the taste of getting wasted
I made it my career

[Hook]

[Jahred]
Here we go again
I can’t see straight
I’m Twiztid off of that Jack Daniels and that purple haze
Here we go again
I’m fuckin’ retarded
From that Xanax, that Vicodin, that cocaine and Bacardi
Here we go again
I’m fuckin’ up again
I’m alienating my family and my closest friends
I’m wasted
Feeling of out place and
Falling so hard, so hard, I’m on my face again
Puffin’ that green shit
Sippin’ that mean shit
Smoking like a lunatic
I feel like I’m ODing again

[Jahred]
(Can somebody get the paramedics over here, please?
This nigga doesn’t have a pulse..
Can somebody call 911, please?
Aw damn..)

[Hook]
