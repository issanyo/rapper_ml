[Talking]
Yeah, Lil' Wyte putting it down for that HCP
Hypnotize Minds straight from Memphis motherfucking Tennessee
Out the bay area
Putting down for all my dawgs, stay down
For all the haters fuck y'all
Every each and one of y'all motherfuckers can doubt me now motherfucker
Cuz I got hardest track in the motherfuckin industry
It's going down maine
Know what I'm saying

[Lil' Wyte]
This is my time so listen up I'm finna bump
I'll give you something I know you been waiting on
With HCP all on the track, airborne attack, strike from the back
Take off yo slack ho
This for the ones all in the field searching for real
Music that feel I got the antidote
Quote the words I write bout to ignite
And light up the room brighter than the sun through a telescope
Beats out the frame I'm still the same
Thoughts were erased from the shit
That I dropped from my underground tapes
Coming with the raw I ain't tryin to fall
Even though I'm small
I give it to ya at 300p's at eight feet tall
Light up the blunt pass it to me
Don't skimp the weez
I'll take your blunt and smoke it in your face
Dro is around I will be found
Picking on the pound
Taking a sample just to let you know how it taste
White in my blood never touched a drug
Don't expect a hundred
Don't think Lil' Wyte don't be getting fucked up
Ecstasy pills ooh make you feel
Like man of steel
Make me get up with my blue chevy fucked up
Creep in the cut hit the strip in the bay
Holla at my dogs too many names for me to say
Cuz if I could I would but see can't and I ain't
Don't take it personal get with me later I blaze dank
And this the first song couldn't have went wrong
Picking it off the shelf to make a part of your collection at home
I'll write my shit, I'll drop my shit, on your dick and shit
Have you having criped all up in yo backbone
Begging my legacy giving the best of me
Life has been stressing me time to impress the streets
Not enough time, not enough money could come close
Nigga like Wyte doing this for them haters to see

(hook)
I done hooked up with the camp
You can doubt me now
I'm about to cruise the map
You can doubt me now
For all them chattering teeth
Bitch doubt me now
Haters even in the streets
Ho doubt me now
I'm gon' be rolling in some dough
But you can doubt me now
You said there would be no hope
But you can doubt me now
I told ya I was gonna make it
You can doubt me now
The hard part for you to face it
You can doubt me now

Un huh .... yea
