[Hook]
Where I'm from we like to smoke
And we like our music up
And we like our women thick
And she know how to roll it up

We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
Feels like the first time

We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
Feels like the first time

[Verse 1:]
Hey, we make for the G's not the guys wearing skinny jeans
Lot of white rappers, now we're sounding like some enemies
And I just smoked high as a hippie on a plane
I'm insane, I've been known to play chicken with a train
They said that it was blue dream, I think that it was purple
I'm funny like a fuckin kind of superbowl commercial
Forgive me, I'm just totem pole, a man on his grind
I'm high sittin in the trap watchin Family Guy
Every single day I'm ridin is the same old shit
Tryna hold it all together like a chain leak fence
I just hit a blunt for the first time in 4 years
I might pop a Xanax bar and chase it with a cold beer

[Verse 2:]
Only smoking OG WYTE Kush, hash wax, G pin
Need a piece of good pussy that I can fall asleep in
If you're looking for me I'm probably in the deep end
Swimming with a Brazilian bitch that loves me on the weekends
I'm always on something, pills, weed or alcohol
Want a shot of craw right now, to the liquor store I ball
Molly in my body and I'm on Hally's body
We getting ratchet as fuck right here in the hotel lobby
We bring the property back down when we act the clow
I'm from Memphis, Tennessee
We blaze the green by the pound
All we do here is smoke and get high
With this life I chose and wouldn't change it
Yea, I'm that guy

[Hook]
Where I'm from we like to smoke
And we like our music up
And we like our women thick
And she know how to roll it up

We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
Feels like the first time

We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
Feels like the first time

[Verse 3:]
We just smoke and get high
Blaze the kush in like the ride
But I could tell from the front that she look thicker from the side
Likes to wipe for this kush, I might roll over and die
You could see me right now
You see I'm leanin to the side
Man this kush is super strong so I suggest you don't try it
Shout out my fuckin plug, why? Cause I ain't gotta buy
It ain't shit you can ask me, you should see it in my eyes
Jelly tryna roll another one but I'm already high
Get Worm on the phone and tell his ass I need a ride
I'm speed ballin right now so you know I can't dry er
A game, Lil Wyte, man they know just how we ride
Ask around town bitch, we just smoke and get high

[Hook]
Where I'm from we like to smoke
And we like our music up
And we like our women thick
And she know how to roll it up

We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
Feels like the first time

We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
We just smoke and get high
Feels like the first time
