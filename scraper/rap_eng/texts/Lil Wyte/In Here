You can step the fuck up off of me (bitch)
I done already told ya you ain't stoppin me (bitch)
Wit killers from the camp that got the back of me (bitch)
You shoulda known I was part of the family (bitch)
Before I'm bout to rock the fuckin industry (bitch)
And plus I'm representin Memphis Tennesee (bitch)
And I ain't givin up until I'm seven feet (bitch)

And plus my killers came wit four-fours aimed at your throat (bitch)

[Verse 3]
The name is Lil Wyte and I'ma set it straight (bitch)
You fuckin wit me you fuckin wit the bay (bitch)
Crucial consequences repeat what you say (bitch)
Molded myslef now how could you have made (bitch)
Left it all bloody when I stepped off the stage (bitch)
Murdered the mic and then went out on a rage (bitch)
Slicin' n dicin' these rappers heads wit blades (bitch)
Your musics amusing but I am not amazed (bitch)
My skill had been sheltered almost like I been caged (bitch)
I been skipped over once and turned to another page (bitch)
Like these other dummies that got dropped off of this label (bitch)
I'm not gon let this money have me snortin off the table (bitch)
But I'm gon make it snappy for approval if I'm able (bitch)
This here is not a lie, a story, a fib or even a fable (bitch)
With HCP and Lil Wyte a perfect combination (bitch)
The crunkest, wildest, toughest motherfuckers in the nation (bitch)

[Chorus]
