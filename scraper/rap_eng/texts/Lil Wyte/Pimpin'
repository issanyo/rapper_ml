[Hook: x2]
Cruising through my side of town
(I'm from the hood pimpin')
Blowing on some shit that's loud
(I'm smoking good pimpin')
Getting money every day
(You wish you were pimpin')
Trying me is not the way
(I wish you were pimpin')

[Verse 1:]
I'm on Frasier drive, windows down
System up, I'm smoking loud
Bumping DJ Paul volume 16 it's going down
It's a sunny day in Memphis Tennessee so hoes around
Feel 1994 and I am on a cloud
OG white kush crop dusting through the town
Got a bitch so bad, blue eyes, her hair is brown
Every time I hit the liquor store I'm leaving out with ground
If I fall inside some pussy this evening I hope I drown
Bad mother-fucker, I come from the gutter underground
And I'm after all my money like it's been in lost and found
WYTE, lay back flow
Heartless, seen this side before
Gathering up the hoes, the dro and money and now I gots to go

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2:]
I'm on Belleroad, windows down
System up and smoking loud
Bumping that ol' haystack, the natural, it's going down
Catch and play struggling, pills we juggling
Told my plug to pass it off
I promise I won't thumble it
MacDonald's, over 1 billion served, I'm hustling
And da da da da da, I'm loving it
Way before this rap game I went hard in the kitchen
And fuck with so much grass
You'd think I cut yards for a living
Man I'm really from the hood, bitch respect that shit
Been in the distribution kinda like selekto hit
And that was all before I hit a booth and started spitting crack
If rap don't work I hit a trap and tell em send a 50 back for real

[Hook: x4]
