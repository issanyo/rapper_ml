[Intro: Lil Wyte]
Often we forget how many people in the Bible honestly dealt their own gimmicks and their lack of faith and their struggles
Remember Jacob himself wrestled with God in Genesis
Remember Paul dealt with the ailment and we are born in his side
We came for good Thomas, the one who asked to see the wounds from Christ' hands after the resurrection

[Chorus: Robin Raynelle]
Everything ain't what it seems
Every little pain came with a dream
I said in order to fly I needed some wings
Jumped off the cliff trying to make them believe
I've been down this road before so many times that I've lost my way
I was only trying to be a better person than I was on yesterday, yesterday

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
I've been thinkin bout her lately, wonderin will she listen?
The beautiful lady that's got a pill addiction
Seen the picture, been a while and I ain't notice it
I guess them roxy 30's have taken over her
She was a queen, she used to have a dream
Of being on the cover of a Maxim magazine
And just like us she grew around the way
Smart too, had a 3.8 GPA
But later in them teen years she got wild
That's just the price of being in the cool crowd
Heard she was drugged and raped when she was found
The cemetery's where she's at now, damn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
It's them days like yesterday
You tried to change knowing there will be a better way
You're in your lane, all you gotta do is hold on
And stay strong when the night seem like it is just too long
Then your lights get cut off the very next morning
And your world is never raining, is pouring
You have no family to fall back on
So it is hard raising children in a single parent home
Then you reach out to alcohol looking for support
And now you on a cup of pills that you can't afford
Your body's aching, yea I've heard it all before
Be a better role model to them 2 babies sittin on the floor

[Chorus]

[Bridge x3: Robin Raynelle]
All you gotta do is believe
With the faith of a mustard seed
And you can move mountains
You can move mountains

[Chorus]
