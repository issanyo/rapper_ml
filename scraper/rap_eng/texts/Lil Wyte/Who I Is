[Verse 1: Dirty Mouth]
I could care less about a motherfucker talkin shit
I can't keep playing games with you boy or your pussy click
Nigga, we too deep in this bitch for you fucking hoes
Niggas gettin buck, ready to knuck, and they throwin bows
But I'mma act up cause I don't give a fuck about your shit
I'mma act a clown on a nigga for acting hard when he
Not, I'm too hot when it come to this, nigga throw your hood up
Throw your sets off in his face and put your fucking good up

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Now step the fuck back nigga 'fore I hurt cha
Y'all niggas comedy, funny to me like Geico commercials

Cause I'll introduce your mouth to this motherfuckin pistol

Don't find your ass mad beside mine, get boxed in a trunk
Please don't give me a reason to give your mama a reason
To shed tears, You better know who I is

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
It's the return of the Memphis...boys spittin' that pimpin
Tearin up them clubs with that syrup syrup sippin
Club full of drugs on the curb just kickin
Juicy J a jiggalo with 85 women
Ridin in a truck young bloods drinkin remi
Underneath the hood, yes my nigga its a hemi

We hit the club, deep as fuck, hate them boys, lets make 'em jump
And the crowd, they actin up, ready to smack somethin up
Lil' Atlanta reppin for the south, this is what we bout
Here to tear this bitch up, somebody in here got me hot
We gon stomp they ass out, drag 'em out the door
Better get, shut they ass up and treat 'em like a ho
Beat 'em long, make 'em go upside ya head wit an elbow
Try to stop Trillville and Three 6, Hell no

[Verse 6: Lil' Wyte]
I know by now someone told you about the cracker in Memphis
Three 6 picked up two years ago, the shit was strictly big business
I went through plenty of G's, took some vacations and more
Got a lot more comin near plus man right now I'm up in New York
That mean that shit is gettin dropped, these boys is up on they clocks
Recording miracles everyday soon that everyone will rock
You shoulda seen this shit comin, your susposed to be some kind of wiz
Memphis, Tennesee and ATL, I'll tell y'all tricks who it is
