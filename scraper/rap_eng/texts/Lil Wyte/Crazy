Sometimes I feel like I'm flyin', sometimes I feel like I'm dyin'
Maybe the world is against me, maybe the world thinks I'm crazy
Sometimes I feel like I'm losin', sometimes I feel like I'm losin'
Maybe the world is against me, maybe the world is a lie

I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy, maybe the world is a lie
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy, maybe the world is a lie
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy, maybe the world is a lie
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

Maybe I can feel it cause I know I'm high, maybe I can ride cause I'm born to die
Maybe I can jump cause I know I'm high, maybe I can kill cause it's in my eye
I don't know why I'm seein' things, I on't know, I'm bein' insane

Sometimes I feel like I'm flyin', sometimes I feel like I'm dyin'
Maybe the world is against me, maybe the world thinks I'm crazy
Sometimes I feel like I'm losin', sometimes I feel like I'm losin'
Maybe the world is against me, maybe the world is a lie

I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy, maybe the world is a lie
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy, maybe the world is a lie
I'm going crazy, I'm going crazy

Now that I have my chance to rearranged it
Crazy is the word that I use to explain it
Find out, what gon' happen in the end
When the ball leave the court and the paper leave the pen
It's a fucked up, shit that we walk through
On a daily basis, some folks you can't even talk to
So I stomp through all of my obsticles with pleasure
The top two's me and I, so who's better
Take me to a place, everyday Sunday weather
Put me in the sand, dro in my hand forever
Reality strikes, the sharper teeth in the bite
I feel like I been gone a month but I ain't left out ya sight
I'm havin' visions of dyin' but God can control so break
The only thing they truly bring to life is the shit you take
I might be labelled as crazy, I'd rather be dead thant brave
The recognition of my mission is to take it in hate
