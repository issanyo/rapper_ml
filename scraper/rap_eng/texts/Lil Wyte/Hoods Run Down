(LiL Wyte)
Gimme da Microphone first so i could buss out dis bubbLe
Whoevea idea dis was dey knew it was some trouble
Cuz i get up in'em, get it sticky, it could get icky and gritty
Crystal clearly comes swiftly when u a chance to get wit me
I Put it down for da B.A.Y. MothafuKca, therapy gorilla squad
U.T.T. Muthafucka, YaLL don't kNow shyt about that chek ya
BAY AREA fact the federal lyricist is 21 years old knockin'em on dey back
Had to take a drug test, thought it was a DRUG test
Studied hard and failed shouldn't of took da answers to my chest
Goofin around gloves off hood basically cuffed up popo's in a Lac Truck
On spinners man das fucked uP. I sat on my couch smoked a bLunt
And create some thunder, den opened da window let da lightning
And make da Police wonder. I'll get'em off the trail while the real criminals wonder
I guess dis summea a lil ol'hustle is too far beyond us

We hustle from sun up to sun down, the cops we get close when they come round
We got to hit the cut and throw the crumbs down my hoods run down, my hoods run down

We hustle from sun up to sun down, the cops we get close when they come round
We got to hit the cut and throw the crumbs down my hoods run down, my hoods run down

Still here and i wouldn't have it no other way
Now knowin what it means to live and die from the BAY!

We hustle from sun up to sun down, the cops we get close when they come round
We got to hit the cut and throw the crumbs down my hoods run down, my hoods run down
