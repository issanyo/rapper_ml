I ain’t here with these dirty rappers
I ain’t fuckin’ with these dirty hoes
I am down in the studio
And then we rock the show
We break in the mid-town
I got to pay the bills
There’s drama that surrounds me
Somebody is gonna get killed
I told all of my homies
Just got real
You rappers got a problem?
Just got real
I don’t wanna see your ...
Just got real
...and now I’m pissed off
You’re on a damn hill
You can come down
I’ma ride the track
Until the wheels fall off
Let’s rap this shit
All that fucked shit
Doing drugs...
I’m here to take back what is mine
It’s not about what you say
It’s about how you say it
...I got the fire control
So the flame is ...,yeah
I ain’t here with these dirty rappers
I ain’t fuckin’ with these dirty hoes
I am down in the studio
And then we rock the show
We break in the mid-town
I got to pay the bills
There’s drama that surrounds me
Somebody is gonna get killed
I told all of my homies
Just got real
You rappers got a problem?
Just got real
I don’t wanna see your ...
Just got real
For me it’s just the money
You don’t mean anything to me
We can talk about something
When you said aboutn new friends
I ain’t making any this year
My homies are dead or in jail
And I am right here
I am fucked up
But I just can’t stop what I’m doing
I have a dream that I’m pursuing
Even if it is the only thing in the world that I wanna do
Keep your head up
I ain’t talking shit
So I’ma win it all with the whole team
Well,hello,my name is Patrick
And I do have a problem
With all the motherfukers in my face
I have a situation that I will solve it
Boy,listen close,I’m telling you once
There’s no place that you can run and hide
I ain’t here with these dirty rappers
I ain’t fuckin’ with these dirty hoes
I am down in the studio
And then we rock the show
We break in the mid-town
I got to pay the bills
There’s drama that surrounds me
Somebody is gonna get killed
I told all of my homies
Just got real
You rappers got to rush
Just got real
I don’t wanna see your ...
Just got real
