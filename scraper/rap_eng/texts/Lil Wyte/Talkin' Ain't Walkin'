[DJ Paul]
Yeah!.....Hypnotizeminds! One more motherfucking year!
This gangster shit will not be televised!
I need all yall to get up!
There some [niggas] in here running their mouth like energizer bunnies
And the shit ain't motherfucking funny
We're about to handle all these hoes in here right motherfucking now...what!

[Hook, Lil Wyte] x2
Haters talkin' but haters ain't walkin'
Into this fucking fire, these haters ain't walkin, into this fucking fire
Bitch-slap that sucker
Bitch-slap that sucker
Bitch-slap that sucker
Bitch-slap that sucker

[Verse 1, Lil Wyte]
Yeah they call me Lil Wyte, I'm back out on the grind
I'm drinking everyday, I'm smoking on some pine
I gotta do it big until the day I die
You cool with me in my face but a hater in disguise, What!
You can get slapped down when I'm in your town
Popping off some rounds when I'm on that crown
We usually pull up slow, with lights off and guns drawn
Everything about to go, you ain't know hooligans were in your home
Take it easy, they don't want shit except your life
They'll even take a small fry, some coke/colt, and your wife
You should've thought about circumstances, reprocussions, and consequences
But you didn't, now you're swimming somewhere in the Mississippi

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2, Lil Wyte]
I ain't gone nowhere, I've been chilling in the same cut
Smoking on the same bud, feeling on the same butt
Still fuck with the Six, still roll with some killers
Still hang with a big click and kick it with drug dealers
So, what you wanna do? I can have you whole crew...hog-tied
Buried alive underneath a swimming pool
But, no I'm not a evil dude, in fact, I'm pretty fucking humble
400,000 records independent, hear my stomach rumble
And I'm just getting started, pimpin'
You ain't seen retarded, pimpin'
Fuck it, I'll be modest to me, I'm the fucking hardest, pimpin'
I can spit harmless yet horrific at the same time, kill you
Bring you to life and get you high with the same rhyme/line

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3, Lil Wyte]
Ok, you ask me how do I do it, I call it whiteboy/wyteboy magic
I'm not the only one with it, I'm just flashy with a passion
I've been missing in action but now I'm back whack rappers better duck and hide
And for all the haters I have around so guard your grills and adjust your eyes
Smoke on, keep cheifing, I ain't trying to ruin your weekend
But I'll fuck your mother though and show you the real meaning of beefing
I'll be grinding while you whining, I'll be shining like a diamond
You thought this dirt would still be worthless if I was realtor building dollars
But keep your head up, I was not trying to destroy your dream
Like Hank Williams said, "It's all good pimpin', you can hate on me."
The more you talk, the more it'll let me know my walk is doing fine
So keep your mouth open, running at all times, motherfucker!

[Hook x2]
