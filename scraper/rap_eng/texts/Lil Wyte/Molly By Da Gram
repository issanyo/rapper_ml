[Intro: Lil Wyte]
Yeah, Lil Wyte, Caskey
The Avengers
YMCMB white music motherfucker

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
Now I usually wouldn't admit to this but right now we gonna get trippy
Eat the molly up a gram at a time, it'll get you hittin' quickly
Follow that with a bottle of water
Little bit of OJ to feel it harder
Shit, I'm rolling now, rolling now, rolling now
Smoking on OG Wyte Kush, I got it growing up in Ann Arbor
So me and Caskey up in this bitch
Getting faded without the barber
Ziplock baggies full of powder
We ain't fucking 'round with that 'caine
This shit ain't even for sale, this personal, bitch, we don't slang
Been in the game and I do this here
Only do molly when it's that pure
Panama City, bitch, we gon' run it
Plus lean, Deezie's and beer
Totally gone, the party go on until the mornin'
I be on the moon when I'm in my zone and
I'm a tad bit wilder than the rest of 'em
Get whatever I want whenever I want it
That molly, it got me going now, I'm seeing double
The average motherfucker would see these things
And all of a sudden they'd be in trouble
I love it, and need a lot more of it, I think I'm comin' down
It's W-Y-T-E, the party animal
And hanging with molly is where I'll be found

[Hook: Lil Wyte]
Eat molly by da gram, eat molly by da gram
Eat molly by da gram, eat molly by da gram
Eat molly by da gram, eat molly by da gram
Eat molly by da gram, eat molly by da gram

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
I made a molly song two years ago, man, I'm over that
Back to selling quarter pounds of kush out a McDonald's sac
Decapitating rappers lately, aggravated by the haters
Acting like we haven't made it, leaving crowds captivated
Way before rap was trappin' daily, ridin' 'round and actin' crazy
Real street dudes, I ain't never signed no affidavit
Pull up to the party, we all just take a molly
They call us the molly gang, they know that we retarded
And they say my crew is takin' off, bet ya boy won't take a loss
Strawberry Cough I'm blowin', only thing that makes me choke
Tell that bitch to take it off, NC double A
That means No Clothes At All, baby, shake it all the way

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Caskey]
I eat molly, but I don't need Molly
Rolling up all this tree with Dolly
And it's dilating my eyes, mane
Five grams, I pop one, I'm slinging Vyvanse
Vaccination, man, it's captivatin' when my plans
Unfold, man, I been selling dro for the longest
Lil Wyte put me on some bong hits that got me feel like nothin' wrong with
How we been livin', we popped up feeling relentless
I'ma be popular with the bitches 'cause of my business
Rolling 'round with these fixes and a ounce of dro
Pop one and bouncing a ho, all your account's on flo'
You ain't pronouncing the no, that's like a drought in the O
I'ma be out with some mo'
And you just be out with ya bros, talkin' game
Bet Jelly Roll say the word and ya'll come up off yo chain
We takin' that, some trips you gotta flip the script and don't make it back
And I hate for that shit to happen
Jamaican wraps what I'm rolling up in the backseat
With a white bitch that Wyte showed me just last week
And I'm 'bout to smoke me a gram off of her ass cheek
She say she...

[Hook]
