[Intro: Sonny Bama]
Hello? What's up baby? Nah, man I'm at the studio, man
Nah like I'm finna walk in to the booth right now
No! there ain't no bitches up here, quit trippin'! God damn!

[Hook: Jelly Roll]
I been here with the crew, and she asks who
We can do what you wanna do
Ya, that's cool. baby we can spend some time
We can just ride, what ever you wanna do baby I don't mind
Just as long as u don't blow my high
Baby girl, don't blow my high
You out your mind, don't blow my high
Baby girl, don't blow my high no no

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
I work my ass off to get you, blew your twenty-first, be at the party just to kiss you
God I miss you
Thinkin' about what we could've been before I dissed you
Called me a bitch in front of my boss, you invested in tissue
I wish you, could only see what I was tryin' to show you
Was that I had it all like and all you had to do was know you had me on lock but some where wonderin' you lost the key
I'm a beast in when I'm in side a cage an I've got to be free
Now I'm on this road fucking up ever thing in sight
And you were the on saying this road needed a bigger piece of Wyte
Baby you quick to do some shit, but I swear to god that I will
Work on our relationship as long as you don't blow my high

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
Round two, I see I see the smoke, tryin' ta get a piece of mind
Bring you out I got this bitch, threaten to leave me behind
Said I gotta get my shit, that she kickin' me out
Said that I'm failure so I'm not on the lease of the house
It that mother fuckin' bull shit we either fightin' or fucking
We need to do less fighting and a lot more fuckin'
If u think its gona' work stoppin' trippin' on the code that I got on my phone baby leave me alone cause I'm grown
Baby girl I'm just keepin' it real
Cause this is my phone hoe you don't pay the bill
So I keep the screen locked to keep your ass up outta it ye ain't try'na help the cause get ur ass up outta here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sonny Bama]
We can take a ride through the city, up town and across the bank
Was up a few grand last week but it all lost today ridin with no place to go
Smokin on an once of drow, money secondary to my buzz that id hate to blow
Turn up the radio wana here some music, don't wanna hear that bull shit
I wanna hear a country song, ridin to some george jones, takin' on fourth wrong
I'm right and you're wrong, no need for debates about it
Why we always arguin that the shit that I hate bout us I just wanna smoke and roll jamin to some totem pole
Weed man gettin low I really hate that had a half now I'm down to shake

[Hook]
