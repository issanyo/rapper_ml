It's 4:20 roll up
It's 4:20 smoke up
It's 4:20 fire up
It's 4:20 toke up

[Verse: 1]
It's 4:20 I'm either in Michigan Cali or Denver with my dog's
Or in a illegal state in the USA just breaking the fucking law
Either way im gonna get high right now and that's how it should stay
As of right now 420 is the international smoker holiday
Hello my name is Lil Wyte and I got some shit you'll probably like
Its coming straight from Stoner town and guaranteed to get you high
And i put my stamp on it like OG white kush i'm granting my mind
Rolled up whatever the fuck you want we'll blow it down till we are blind
Yeah we do this all the time if i can grow it im gonna smoke it
Soon as its trimmed cured and jarred we'll break it down roll it and toke it
I been on this mic for a while and you better believe when im speakin i ain't jokin
It's that loud and its 420
Puff puff pass you know the rules homie

Grab your weed get your lighter lets get higher fire up
Fire Marshall tryin ta shut us down but we ain't high enough
I don smoked on plenty weed but this shit here is kinda rough
OG white kush is the hybrid that is my supplier of

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
Well im smoking on some shit that got me feeling quite amazing
OG white kush but i sprinkled in some sour grape an
This is not something you get and put up in the Hookah
Mini cigarillo do the job hit like bazooka
Something bout this week has got me on my Project Pat-a
Tripping with the munchies in the store candy I'm after
All i hear is laughter my homies on the other aisle
Eyes are tight red white and blue and all i can do is smile
Snap outta that flow lets head back to the yo so we can smoke
Cause i gotta lil something on my dome right now that really needs to be wrote
I'm high as a bats ass an don wanna lose this thought process that I'm in
Get me that paper an pen and hit the blunt once more
An i lost that thought again
