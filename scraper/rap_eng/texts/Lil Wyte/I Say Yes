Pull the dro out, break the dro down
Roll it up tight, light it, pass it all around, i do it all day, i gotta stay high, if you say no to drugs, and then i have to say why, at the age of 12 i was introduced to weed, 3 years latta i started dropping hits of LSD, its an hallucinogen, you have to be careful when you take it, if you have an evil mind you might be conversating with satan. and i made it through the freakin pin, mary jane remained my friend, even though when times get hard she'll be with me to the end, dont say no it feels so much better to say yes, here swallow these, be on yo knees, and put yo body to the test

Chorus(2x)
I say yes to drugs, I say yes to drugs, I say yes to drugs
We dont just say no we too busy sayin yeah!
We dont just say no we too busy sayin yeah!

When you see me i be fuckin high, I can touch the fuckin sky, some of the shit i be on have me thinkin i can fuckin fly, but im not dumb enough to try, and dont even ask me why, fuck it im gunna go for it and find out if im super guy! Oxycotton, Xanax Bars, ambiens and loratabs, will have you itching, scratchin every body part that you have, make a call to get some more, a day without them is a bore, gotta have something in my system ill take mine and even yours, im lil wyte the most known king of intoxication, got some questionable pills? let me see them before you take em. ACP we glorify the usuage of illegal substances, Somebody gotta represent the regular and i love it!

Chorus(2x)
