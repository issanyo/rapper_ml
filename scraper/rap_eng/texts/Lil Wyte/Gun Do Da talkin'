[Hook x2]

I'mma blast on a hater
And worry 'bout it later
Got heaters in my hands
Masked up like Darth Vader
I don't wanna rap
I let my guns do da talkin'
I don't wanna rap
I let my guns do da talkin'

[Verse 1]

Naah I don't wanna rap
Or even talk to you chumps
I eat, sleep, get high
Even walk with this pump
You crossed me wrong one time
One times too many
I got about a thousand rounds
And i'll pop off plenty
And I know youngstas in the hood
That will pop for penny's
So fo a hundred bones you'll wash up
On that banks of the sippi
And they virginity they ain't been takin'
But they take what shorty like
Now he on his way upstate
They gave a shorty life
Thats what I mean when I say
"We'll worry 'bout it later"
He ain't think he just went out
And blasted [?] hater
Life's too short to not be out here
Chasin that paper
Thats why I'm out here
Masked up in all black like Darth Vader
BITCH!

[Hook x2]

I'mma blast on a hater
And worry 'bout it later
Got heaters in my hands
Masked up like Darth Vader
I don't wanna rap
I let my guns do da talkin'
I don't wanna rap
I let my guns do da talkin'

[Verse 2]

Now if you see me in the streets
Dont think I won't do sometin' crazy
Walk up with this 3.80
Put it right to ya baby
I got kids and I know that could be the worse thing I could do
If anyone takes some beef that far there really meanin' business fool
So just cooperate - don't make a sudden move
One wrong word could leave some bullets up in you
Im so gangsta bitch don't even get me twisted
You got pastel pills and your brain could get evicted
And we don't fuck around in the gritty grimy great city of Memphis
We known for three things - barbecues, good music and pimpin'
So if you make your way down here
Make sure your strapped when you out walkin' cuz
We don't rap around out here
We let our pistols do the talkin'
YEEEAAAH
