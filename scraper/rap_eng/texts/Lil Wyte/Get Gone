[Chorus 2x]
I got no heart no soul a ski mask a big toe
You get wrong and I'm a show you how you can get gone (get gone)
I'm a show you how you can get gone (get gone)
I'm a show you how you can get gone

[Verse 1]
Okay you're listening to a mutherfuckin monster cuz he's behind the gates of hell
Step into the darkness and I will show you where I dwell
In the shadows of the trees lurking busy city streets
The animal is hungry so the animal is about to eat
A carnivore of human flesh violence is my second nature
Just because I slice you into pieces doesn't mean I hate cha
You were snoopin' around under a full moon's light
And happened to cross the path of the wrong fool Lil Wyte
I'm a leave ya mentally scarred with demonic visions a Satans apprentice
Call me and ask ya questions cuz I believe in my own religion
Take another look at the big picture and reverse ya reasons
I ain't the only mutherfucker out here changin' like the seasons

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
I'm a scientific experiment gone real wrong
In the dark basement one night in a very scary home
It was Friday the 13th the rain was comin' down hard
At the same time lightning struck the front and back yard
The ? shut down for one minute that's when I died
The doctor wasn't finished but he declared it a nice try
Layin' on the table all of a sudden I started breathin'
With no help from his equipment and the doctor can't believe it
'It's alive' he screamed as I ripped off his head
Superhuman strength in me I guarantee he's dead
Now I'm on the loose free and I'm roamin' through the streets
Hungry as hell and I'm lookin' for somethin' to eat

[Chorus 2x]
