Suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide
Homicide, homicide, homicide, homicide

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
Running out of time, losing my mind
Hate this place, feel like dying
Brains steady flying all over the place
'Don't want to live' written on my face
Gotta get up outta here, gotta go
Yes I know where I'm gonna go
Hot is cold where they take souls
Satan rule the land, been a long road
I bet you wonder why I'm saying these things
Lost my job, got no change
Car got stolen, bills backing up
Kids hungry and I'm starting to feel the pain
Tired of the world, tired of groupie girls
Brain's starting to scream thoughts in this world
If I have to face another hater I'mma pull out the motherfucking Mossberg pump
Put it to your dome, yeah that boy gone
Off of the map, cap been blown
How ya like me now, hating asshole?
My life's fucked, that's fo sho
If you wanna know, yes I'll tell ya
How it goes, yes I'll tell ya
But you gotta stay tuned to the zone
To hear what happened to the big failure

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
It's the last straw for me to fall
I can't sleep, can't see at all
Done smoked a pound, drank a pint of syrup
Mixed 30 rolls with Tylenol
About to fly away, out this bitch
Have dreams, but I can't get rich
Too many problems in my life now to be worried about stacking chips
Mom's sick as fuck, dad going crazy, girlfriend saying we're having another baby
I can't afford the two that I got, but you know I love them two little ladies
That's why it hurts to say goodbye
I can't save it, don't know why
People say 'well, you have to try'
Let the motherfuckers live this lie
Popped a hundred pills, eyes are closed
Heart is pumping, body getting cold
No cell phone, no one knows where I'm at, that's what I want
Breathing getting hard, death getting close
Creeping up on the devils back bone
Times ran out, so has my liquor
Holla at you motherfuckers, I'm gone

[Hook]

(Reversed)
You need to stop blaming everybody else for your problems. Ninety-five percent of your problems are self-made. Hypnotize Minds does not condone suicide. You need to turn around and look in the mirror. If you took this time to revert the song, you either got the answer or you've got too much time on your hands. Little Wyte, ACP, I'm out baby. Holla
