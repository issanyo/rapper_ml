[Chorus]
Follow me through space
(i can show ya better than i can tell ya come with me)
Follow me through space
(your mind can journey to all corners of this galaxy)
Follow me through space
(i can show ya better than i can tell ya come with me)
Follow me through space
(your mind can journey to all corners of this galaxy)
I sat on the moon and smoked a blunt, while trippin' ballz on LSD
After watching that documentary i think it was DMT
Cuz i just shot right into the cozmos at lightspeed and talked to god
She told me everything gonna be alright with just a nod
Blablablasted back to space the light was bright i didn't see her face
And every word in the human dictionary can't describe the place
My mind was at i could try to take ya back but you gotta follow me
Pop you two or three sit back in your seat and let this song repeat
Halfway to the light you'll feel a slight pinch an your thoughts tingle
All sight gets lost your hearing goes but now your soul is single
Anything that you've ever wanted to know right now is that time to ask
All of my questions got answered, now my future now understands my past..

[Chorus]
Light yearz away from most of you but still i hear the whispers
I can hear you bumpin' my smoking song while breaking down the swisher
You've been following for a minute now an I'm not about to let you down
Not now, we done came way to far to turn back, lets go
I put it down an know freedoms still behind me and that shows dedication
Outer limits of the milky way is where were going on vacation
Were facing constellations were now upon the stars
A spaceship that temptations about to take your patience very far
Ive never been more sure about one thing than i am right now and that's the truth
I wrote this verse on Saturn's ring and dropped it on Pluto's vocal booth
Were almost there i can see the light were traveling opposite the sun
This journey that your on with me is going to be the unspoken one

[Chorus +sick beat ]
