I get drunk and I pop pills
I can show you, but I can’t tell you how it feels
This a complicated life, the one that I live
I don’t give a shit bitch, it is what it is
I’m on my own shit, own shit, lost in my zone shit
Own shit, own shit, lost in my zone shit
I’m on my own shit, own shit, lost in my zone shit
Lost in my zone shit, lost in my zone shit

Two crazy baby mamas, two daughters, too little time
It’s hard for me to address my true feelings in the rhyme
I try and try and just keep coming up with empty lines
Billions of thoughts creep around the outer edges of my mind
And I’m intelligent but use alcohol and drugs as a crutch
For some reason when I’m high and drunk, I don’t feel the pain that much
So I just put some more OG in another blunt
Bottle up my problems and keep my eyes faced to the front
Head in the sky, always high, never looking down
And if I don’t plan to land, then I don’t never have to see the ground
Captain of the plane and all the bullshit, fuels the tank
And right before we boarded, we cleaned out all of the Memphis banks
Money train or money jet, we gonna get that money bet
Don’t anyone know what we doing, look at all the phonies sweat
Can’t tell you where I’m going, I'm at, or even were I was
If something goes wrong tonight, then I’ll just say it was because

I got a career that held on somehow for now well over a decade
And still get shows every weekend with no fucking radio play
I guess I’m ahead of my time, or even walking the perfect line
But I still can’t get no sleep, cause my hours are fucked from driving and flying
That’s part of the game, I know that so I deal with it
Crack the crown open I wash it down and take some pills with it
That’s the only way I’m getting rest in Memphis ten
Call me what you wanna call me, but you don’t know where I have been
I’ve seen my homies die, watched my child get took in court
Plus my pops is dead, I no longer have that father support
You think it’s easy being me? I got as many problems as you
And that was a few that bothers me, keyword: 'was a few'
Listen I've walked, rode bikes and drove up this road
And I’m gonna keep it 150 miles per hour on this ho
Tires are never gonna blow
Engines never gon' explode
I’m W-Y-T-E I don’t care what you think of me
And just so you know
