(Chorus)
Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

(Verse 1 - Lil Wyte)
Im smokin on some killa kill
Yep yep Im high
Gotta do it ev'ry day
Why? Thats my lifestyle
Grape cigarello filled up with good dro
Ridin down Broverly tell me what you hit fo
Come around my way better be prepared to cheif
We twist em right up out the f**kin' OZ
I be token till 6 o' clock in tha mornin'
As long as no one comes in to stop me
Im Lil Wyte the almighty good weed connoisseur
Hydro, dont ever come to ya cheap
If Im in the Memphis city streetz
Ima get the best trees
All the smack smokers can read it and weep
I lay back in the Cut
Smokin on a big blunt
Waitin on a call to get some more cronic
This shit one hit will sit cha down
Have ya chokin all night ready to vomit
50 bags out tha sack in them houses mayne
Will have a pot head like me spinnin insane
Amounts of cash out these bags
Of this purple kush, jack frost, and this blueberry hurricane
I got some right here ta knock ya dick in the dirt
And Im bout to pull it up out my pocket
Take it slow, dont hit it too hard
This is liable to pull ya neck
Right up out its socket

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)

Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

(Verse 2 - Lil Wyte)
Ima a California dough dough
Marijuana inspecta
Always in slo-mo like I been screwed
Keep me on the low low
Like a private eye
When its time to get high
Ill make the call to you
Ive been keepin some good shit
Ohhh all the good shit
Give me a name and
Ill find it and blow it
If I can't locate within week
We'll get the seeds
And we'll f**kin grow it
Ain't no thang to me
Pimpin' its just me
Really it all depends on the consumer
How many times have you heard of it
Causin' a heart attack or givin someone a tumor
None! I said it, not a one
Zero, zilch, nodda, zero
Ill take a mothaf**kin pound to the head
Ima stoner, call me the ganja hero
Laugh at what you wanna laugh at man
Crash where ever you wanna crash at man
After you hit this blunt, take a puff of this silvia
It'll put cha in the trashcan
I smoke almost everything I can inhale
Like Sticky said, he's got Forbidden Fruit
I said break it down, roll it up, lite it up
Ill be the judge of this Jesus Juice

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high

Break it down (Break it down)
Roll it up (Roll it up)
Lite it up (Lite it up)
Get high. get high, get high
