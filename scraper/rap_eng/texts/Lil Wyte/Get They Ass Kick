[Chorus 2X]
Somebody gon get they ass kick ass kick
Somebody gon get they wig split wig split

[Project Pat 2X]
The main nigga on the block, where its hot talkin shit
I beat the main motherfucker somewhere dead in a ditch

[Chrome]
I ain't never scared of one of you little ass fuckers
Cause I hurt a motherfucker just for thinkin im sucker
You Donnie Brasco, counterfit weak ass bitch
You runnin off at your mouth, but can't finish the shit
Ya'll niggas real hoes need to cop you some pants
Every line that im speakin make a bitch nigga mad
Even your own nigga tellin me theres hoe in your blood
You not a full time hustla you a wanna be thug
Keep on talkin sideways ima show you whats up
I put the A and letter K and let it chop you up
Me and my thugs ain't playin we'll fuck you up
Run up on you with that thang let it touch you up
See im Chrome Coleon im the truth in the booth
In or out this motherfucker niggas know that im true
I brought my guys with me industry bangers theyre found
And Lil Scrappy ride with me gone get ate like ham


[Chorus 2X]
Somebody gon get they ass kick ass kick
Somebody gon get they wig split wig split

[Project Pat 2X]
The main nigga on the block, where its hot talkin shit
I beat the main motherfucker somewhere dead in a ditch

[Lil Scrappy]
Bitch dont come at me wrong cause im grown I wear teflon
Leave you a shot to the dome leave you dead at home
Wussup, I thought you were the bigger nigga on the block
But you talkin all that shit and got your punk ass shot
Shit, OG's in the hood get tried too
Laid the fuck out where nobody can find you
Oh big shot huh? So what you gon do?
I spit in your face like the food in drive thru's

[Lil Wyte]
God damn Lil Wyte Lil Scrappy ridin Chevy thangs through the M
Searchin for haters lurkin for certain hatin me and him
I am the equivalence of what would happen if Paul and Juicy be smokin blunt
Of some real good shit
Ive been known to mix up your brain, im on another plane
From Memphis to ATL all races they know my name
This HCP is a gang, this HCP's in my vein
Whenever I put my talent out it fall out the sky like rain

[Chorus 2X]
Somebody gon get they ass kick ass kick
Somebody gon get they wig split wig split

[Project Pat 2X]
The main nigga on the block, where its hot talkin shit
I beat the main motherfucker somewhere dead in a ditch
