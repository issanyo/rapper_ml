Shiny rims like a star, i've been tippin on some bong
Blow a ounce of that good, when i come through my hood
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
Shiny rims like a star, i've been tippin on some bong
Blow a ounce of that good, when i come through my hood
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy

Night lite flickin high, and im ridin in a benz
I sware when im in it, i got so many friends
I got so much money, in my pocket right now
Bad broad to my right, rollin blunts, pickin up da pound
Got a forty cal. sittin on my left leg, hand on the woodgrain
V-12 engine, plus the bump bang
Cruizin through da bay, going to f**k wit UTT
Gotta holla at my folks when im in these city streets
I be in and outta town like a greyhound bus
As soon as i reach da town im callin my boo to get in them guts
I gotta do it big, why? everybody is watchin
Comin through da hood iced out shinin and flossin

Shiny rims like a star, i've been tippin on some bong
Blow a ounce of that good, when i come through my hood
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
Shiny rims like a star, i've been tippin on some bong
Blow a ounce of that good, when i come through my hood
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy

If i come down ya block, and ya see them twenty fours
Just know i could of put twenty sixes on this hoe
They would fit with no rub, would have fit like a glove
But im five foot nine so i would have had to jump up in the truck
And i got things to do, places to go
People to see, dro to smoke
Liquor to drink, pills to roll
Money to make, and money to blow
Ive been grindin since i as seventeen
So im supposed to have it
Shinin like a diamond
Hatas sick and man they can't stand it
Doubt me now's a classic
Phinally phamous was unbelievable
The one and only's gunna be the cd that they bleedin for
And yes i know my game has stepped up
Im a grown man, theys like dat bout dat boy
Hatas still dont understand

Shiny rims like a star, i've been tippin on some bong
Blow a ounce of that good, when i come through my hood
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
Shiny rims like a star, i've been tippin on some bong
Blow a ounce of that good, when i come through my hood
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
They be like, i likes dat bout dat boy
