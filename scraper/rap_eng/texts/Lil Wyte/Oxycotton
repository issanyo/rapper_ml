Go on and slip me two xanax Bars I'm ready to git fool
Fifth to crown to wash it down, I'm downtown snapping rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxycontin' in my system man I'm feeling kinda strange

Watch me choke about this dope Blueberry from Texas
She wanna git up in rotation that's too bad cause I'm stressing
'Bout now it's 1:30 a.m eleven percocets just entered me
Fifteen minutes from this second I'll be crawling on my knees

Laughing at the crowd of all the clowns that be surrounding me
Take another lortab to call me down and let me see
Body be relaxed muscles be loose, and you have stopped the pain
No more bitching 'bout your day and work and driving in the rain

Put up with the fussing and discussion I plant in your brain
Hypnotize ya minds, like all the rest but I come through the veins
Take a chill pill to slow me down and git back in this game
Gotta be up on ya P's and Q's to even feel it mane

Oxycontin', xanax bars, percocet and lortab
Valiums, morphine, patches, exctacy and it's all up for grab
Whatcha want, whatcha need hit me up I got you mane
Whatcha want, whatcha need hit me up I got you mane

Scarecrow, scarecrow what's that you're popping?
A powerful pill they call oxycontin'
But it's so tiny, that it catch you dragging
Haven't you heard big things come in small packages

I prefer the orange's with the black O C
Take to where you can I move about you see
Some people mellow down in a needle and shoot 'em up
Buy I pop 'em with seroquel like glue, I am stuck

See I'ma pill popper so I'ma keep poppin' 'em
Gimme twenty xanax and I'ma start droppin' 'em
They ain't no stoppin' him when they in my system
Mane I really miss 'em can you help me get 'em

I heard you have clidina, on that fucking pill shed
Gimme some fuckin' ec' gimme some percocets
I need me some four bar, so I can break down
Cause a nigga like me 'finna take it to funky town

Oxycontin', xanax bars, percocet and lortab
Valiums, morphine, patches, exctacy and it's all up for grab
Whatcha want, whatcha need hit me up I got you mane
Whatcha want, whatcha need hit me up I got you mane
