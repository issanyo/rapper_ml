[Intro: Skit from an "Ice Man" interview]
It was a man and he was begging
And pleading, and praying, I guess
And he was "Please, God"n all over the place (hahaha)
So I told him he could have a half an hour
(yea) to pray to God
And if God could come down and change the circumstances
He'd have that time. (did he come?)
But God never showed up
And he never changed the circumstances...

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Nigga better pray or ... get yo family sacked up
Nigga better pray or never go broke
While yo bitch ass nigga on a come up
Nigga better get it right or keep it right
'fore a nigga like me go on a crime spree
I prolly hire one of the bitches
To have you niggas laid up in the IC

[2x]
These niggas know that I do it
These niggas know that I do it
You bitches know, you used to it
You bitches know, you used to it

[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Now I lay you down to sleep
I pray to lord yo soul he'll keep
Wake and bake when I awake
I gotta make alotta cake
Fuck around and get yo ass caught up in some shit
IV connected to ya on a bitch
Don't nobody here a gangsta rapper chick
My hitters hit you up ... ass on (?)
Dope ... niggas on 'caine
I fuck you up cause money ain't the thang
Real bitches ain't got love for a trick
... let's hit a lick
You know I am ratchet
I will grab it if it's in my face
Robbing niggas old school
All my niggas got (?)

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I be bustin' on these hoes
Niggas stay bustin' on these foes
Keep that nine milli 24/7 with me
Ain't trustin' none of these hoes
I presentin' you niggas with the truth
Cause I ain't got no reason that I lie
I'm a hated man if I wouldn't ride
With that iron or the nine I would probably die
I don't take no shit from these bitch ass niggas
I'm takin' shit from these bitch ass niggas
That watch and ring, gold chain
And that pill bag you rich ass nigga
Hire niggas from my hood
Go come up in my hood
Now gimme that bullet pull
I pull that full automatic on a trick
To get shit now me and him good

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Nigga better pray or ... get yo family sacked up

[Verse 3: Young Noble from "Outlawz"]
Outlawz, DJ Paul, all my riders convicts
Thirsty for some conflict
Rowdy like a moshpit
They got me on my Pac shit
Strapped up, dogged out
I think I'm goin' crazy
My mind in a nuthouse
... I'm like Michael
Jordan, score run
Plenty game to the top no forfeit
With a raw motherfuck start a war with
Respect me like I ...
Pull up on a motherfucker like (?)
When it comes to the grind gotta improvise
It's a matter of time before I give a smile

[Verse 4: Hussein Fatal from "Outlawz"]
Ain't nobody want that, they don't want that
(what?) that crucial conflict
Kill 'em all up, two guns up
Peep boy here the gang ain't' beef for the nonsense
Soon as they ready let me know I'mma bang on 'em
Clip on ninety, I ain't even got the aim on
Always a hunnid, they never worried I'mma change on 'em
Death should be worried if I start to say saint on 'em
Gotta get that kick back
Got the .44 sittin' in my draws on my sixpack
Always involved (?) law
Conflict of interest, I said it before

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Nigga better pray or ... get yo family sacked up

[Skit from the movie "The Devil's Rejects"/Beat Change]
I want you to pray to you god
I want you to pray that he comes and saves you
Asap, asap, asap, asap...

[Verse 5: Koopsta Knicca]
Bitches think I'm bluffin'
Burn my bibles, fuck it
Koopsta burn in hell
With yo white Jesus bitch, fuck him
On my knees I never pray
Bitch fuck yo holy day
Satan I pray: take me away (Haa!)
Lights bringer, Lucifers singer
Almighty refer all demons came up
Nail me on the cross, that ain't shit
Call my nigga Fatal, oh go get that bitch

[Verse 6: Crunchy Black]
I been doin' all this dirt
Puttin' in this work
Smilin' and shootin' hoe
This bullshit gon' work
I be gettin' it how I live
You ain't in my field
Hustlin' so hard nigga
Stackin' up for real
Nigga I would kill
Cut you up for real
In the trunk for real
Put you in a field

[Bridge: DJ Paul]
Then I fuck all you niggas off
Fuck all you niggas off
Put my nine milli in yo motherfucking mouth bitch

[Hook: DJ Paul]

If you fall about yo paper

You don't give a motherfuck
