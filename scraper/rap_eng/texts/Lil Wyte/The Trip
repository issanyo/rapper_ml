[Skit: Lil Wyte]
Wil E. Haze hit me up whenever you get this message mane
It's Wyte, we need you to send that uhh
Try to send it today if you can, I'm actually in the mountains

[Intro 1: Wil E Haze]
So this one time I was trippin right...
My homeboys had givin me some LSD and some weed
All day long I was like "Yo I'm trippin balls"
End of the night my homeboys was like
"Yo got something to tell you mane"
That LSD, that shit was bunk homie"
I'm like "Naw man"
Had me convinced the weed had be trippin'
I was like "This Buddha got me trippin'
Motherfuckers started crackin' up an hour later mane
They was lying, "I was trippin balls the whole time!"

[Verse 1: Wil E Haze]
I just ate a ten strip, and we's about to take a trip
Got about a sheet left, lets just eat the fuckin' rest
I'm trippin (I'm trippin'), I'm out my mind (Out my mind)
I lost track of time, This LSD the truth and yous a god damn lie!
Dabs in the blunt gettin' laced out
I'm Spacley Sprocket spaced out
Wyte passed out before the peak
Puttin em online for this Worldstar leak
Waking up and he quoting movies
I'm quoting lines from "Lighter & A Loosie"
I hope I don't die like James Belushi
I hope I don't die from a bowl of sushi
Breath drops filled with a liquid dose
We transporting from coast to coast
No detection, Shamans reflection
Vibed out and tribed out
I'm in my hideout, orange juice and LSD
Plus this Vitamin THC, won't you trip an journey with me
My mind melting, My mind's excelling
My brain is swelling
I think I'm gon die (I think I'm gon die)
I'm so damn high (I'm so damn high)
I can't make a decision
Wanna slip it to the politicians
Make it my mission (make it my mission)
Let's get the whole world trippin'!

[Intro 2: Lil Wyte]
Mane look... (look)
Let me tell you a little story (lil story)
I had a homie call my phone (Lil Spark)
Talking about he had some acid right (LSD)
Now keep in mind when he told me this
I ain't seen no acid in Memphis Tenn in like...
Literally a couple years (a couple at least)
Now this was back in 2003
You're talking like 13, 14 years ago
Ya know what I'm sayin (fo sho)
I didn't believe it was gonna be any good (I didn't)
So we went over there copped the shit (we did)
Ya know what I'm sayin
He was like brah (It was actually like really really good)
I'm telling you this is the shit
I was like whatever brah
We'll see (ah Lil Wyte)

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
The night that Doubt Me Now dropped, we were on the prowl for ecstasy
It had been like 2 or 3 years since Memphis had seen any good LSD
My phone rang, my homie said he had a 10 strip of that 70's shit
I told him I'm a pro when it come to this and I ain't nothin' to be messing with
He said bruh, I promise this is the real
Me and all of my dawgs are fucking gone
I'll even give you all of your money back in an hour
If you can find your phone
I took him up on his offer
We went it and copped it so we could celebrate
Bout 45 minutes into the the trip, my brother Onion had him a yellow face
And said damn, this shit strong
What is going on inside of my dome?
Felt like I was sitting on the moon all alone
But I was only 3 blocks away from home
Next thing you know I'm talking to God
She explained it was my duty
To spread my word to the rest of the world
On what it is that's running through me
My whole life flashed before my eyes
I'm seeing the future, present and past
Thinking to myself I love this feeling
But wondering how long would it last?
I glance up to see my Acid Song had been on repeat
For about 5 hours
Then I find out 5 years later it was DMT
Fuck!
