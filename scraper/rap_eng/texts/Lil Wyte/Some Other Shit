[Chorus 4x]
Who you think you fuckin with
We be on some other shit
We be on, we be on, we be, we be on some other shit

[Verse 1]
This for them haters gone disrespectful when I see ya
I'm hoppin' out of a black two seata wit a heata and her nicknames Quetta
I got her in the hood yeah I talk a lot of shit but she back me up good
For one second don't forget trick I run this Memphis Tennessee we be on some Top Gun shit
Fly over your house M-16 and drop a bomb on it
We don't give a fuck we tryin to take out all your shit
And we some Titans Grizzlies and Tigers that Volunteer
To kill ya clean ya in a river throw you on a barbeque grill
So who da fuck you think your fuckin wit we be on some other shit
The stunna out the gutta started the south but watch the fuckin shit

[Chorus 4x]

[Verse 2]
I be on some dro and shit you be on some blow and shit
I'm rockin' shows around the globe and your still on some local shit
I can say sumimason kunichiwa can I get some yen?
That's Japanese for 'Excuse me hello can I get some money man?'
Can you do that? I don't think so, so go back to where you from hoe
I get dollars, Euros, Pecos and they come in by the truck load
I make CP you can't see me on these beats or in these streets
Cuz I toke heat and beef is beef and you will leak from head to feet
It's obvious that I'm harder than a majority of your favorite rappers
An underground phenomenal sensation and your papers what I'm after
So drop it off, drop it off bitch I got it sawed-off
I run wit a click so quick before you even try to think your ass gets hauled off

[Chorus 4x]
