[Chorus]
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
And drive it like you stole it
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
And drive it like you stole it
(Lil' Wyte)
Its Saturday night an me and Totem pole drunk cruising music roll
We got liquor we got dro now we out looking for some hoes
An we in Nashville this shit shouldn't be hard
All we gotta do is hit Broadways
Do doughnuts in the intersect in a second and all the broads come our way
Its a jellyroll an lil wyte night and y'all know how them nights go
No matter what the fucks on the agenda we always end up in the studio
Pull up both beatin were both rattlin like a 2013 impala
Blow your speakers and i got tweakers ready to suck us up n swallow
Take the head like sleepy hollow an all my bitches dirty 'dults
An im from Memphis we do barbecue and eat pussy like its helper
Im smoking the car so bad it looks like we just parked off inside some fog
But the rubber burnin' off of the rim and you can't see the car at all cuz i just

[Chorus]
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
And drive it like you stole it
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
And drive it like you stole it
(Jellyroll)
Hello
First white boy in the game guy
Was the answer there to that rental (hello)
Don't fuck with all these rappers (don't)
Cuz these rappers so sentimental (yeah)
That bitch she got potential (she know)
Cuz she knows how to work the metal (she does)
We on a 3-6 instrumental (come on)
And she rode me like a rental (come on)
Saddle up cowgirl
Come on lets get it hoe
It can go down girl
But i ain't trippin' though
Hey Lil Wyte we got us a banger
Everybody knows that i still keep it gangster
I ain't give a word bout none of these critics
Tell em they can ride my middle finger
Same ole me I ain't changing shit
I'm the same ole dude on the same ole shit
Got a brand new crib and a brand new whip
Got the same ole clique and the same ole bitch
An don't understand these radio stations
Got plenty singles but they ain't in rotation
Fire that dope up fuck probation
Walk up in the bank get a standing ovation
Totem..

[Chorus]
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
And drive it like you stole it
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
Ride it like a rental
And drive it like you stole it
