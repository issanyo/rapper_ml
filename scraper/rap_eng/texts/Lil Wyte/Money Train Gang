I'm riding with that Money Train
Money Train
Money Train
Money Train
Money Train
Money Train
That Money Train Gang

I'm riding with that Money Train
(All Aboard) Money Train
(All Aboard) Money Train
(All Aboard) Money Train
That Money Train Gang (3X)

(Verse 1)

Money Train Gang, we get bread
Money Train Gang, gang ahead
Money Train Gang gonna get that dough
What the hell gotta hear we know you scared
Bandanas on our head we masked up
Big guns in our hand we strap up
We know you got it, we coming for it
Not a good time to play Superman bro
Kryptonite, I'll shut ya down
Cruise right into your town
Rob your bank and breach your security
And let you leak the criminals out
Recruit them, hit the next city and do even more damage there
A good Lil Wyte sholl might take all the Gs in your town and leave it there
We rock clubs kill sound systems, and take your girlfriends
I'm a hard act to follow, bitch and I'll be there till the world ends
Its Wyte Music over here
And we gonna get that money
The way things looking around here
Soon we gonna be shitting money

(Hook)

(Verse 2)

Yeah Yeah

I'm on the tracks, trains are moving
Money Trains loaded down to the caboose
Bad bitches, all aboard get ready for a long ride lets get loose
We got kush, we got liquor everybody hold on, lets go faster
I've got a lil bit of Molly right here
Than its guaranteed to be an all night blaster
Fuck backwards don't even look over your shoulder when you walking
Keep your eyes on the money at all times it don't matter if your mind is talking
Listen I've got a master plan and it involves a lot of money
Best part is its safe in my brain
And no you cannot take that from me betcha
Really want to know what it is huh
But you really don't know how to ask
Secret Society Money Train Gang members know things that can't be passed
Partee got on the media faculty media demanded we should huddle
He asked "Wyte what it do whats the move damn fool"
I said sit down and shut up
