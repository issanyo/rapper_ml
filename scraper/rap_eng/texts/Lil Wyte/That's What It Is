[Intro: Project Pat]
Hypnotize Minds Lil Wyte it's goin' down reppin' reppin' reppin' reppin' reppin' Bay Area
Y'all know what it is Memphis Tenn. Hypnotize mutherfuckin' Minds

[Chorus 8x]
That's what it is then (that's what)
That's what it is then

[Verse 1]
I'm 5'9' Caucasian and not to friendly
155 pounds skinny cracker beer belly
Born ready every time I step outta the do'
I gotta have Reeboks on my feet and a pocket full of purple dro
You heard fo' sho' fuckin' with ya boy
I got toys that cost a lot and I'm gonna do it big
It doesn't matter if I'm the boss or not
I've lost a lot and gained some more and got plenty comin' in
Why you countin' yo pennies that's okay that's what it is then
I gotta whip on big rims the bump comes from the back
And everybody love it when I beat up the track
Big money fast cars and dro (that's what it is then)
Bad bitch with me that's how I roll (that's what it is then)

[Chorus 8x]

[Verse 2]
Okay I'm high I'm drunk I'm all of the above
I come through the backdoor to the mutherfuckin' club
I'm cool and people know when I come around
Cuz they can smell the crown and they can see the cloud
I got my bad bitch on my arm fo' sho'
And my hypnotize minds charge let a hata know
That I got my shit under complete control
And ya own hoe said you can't compete with my flow
Cuz I got it on lock and I keep bringin' it in
As long as I got ink up in my mutherfuckin' pen
Big money fast cars and dro (that's what it is then)
A bad bitch with me that's how I roll (that's what it is then)

[Chorus 8x]
