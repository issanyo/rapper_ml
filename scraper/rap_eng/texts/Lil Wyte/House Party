[Hook:]
I've got a keg on ice, sprite and two pints
Suits cocaine and I don't even do white
We bout to have a house party, house party, house party
House party tonight
Enough liquor to kill a bull
Bring your home girls, it's cool
But leave your bathing suits at home
We skinny dipping in the pool
We bout to have a house party, house party, house party
House party tonight

[Verse 1:]
I woke up in a great mood, it's Friday, nothing to do
No show, no studio tonight, time to call my fuckin' crew
Normally don't do it, but I just send a mass text
Tellin' everyone, come kick it, here's my fuckin' address
We gon' smoke until we choke, drink until we hit the floor
First room, on the right got mollie
Two rooms down you'll find some blow
I got 150 bad ass bitches on the way
Some are groupies, some are strippers, and they all are down to play
Get yo ass over here quick and fast, mane it's bout to go down
Right now I'm rollin' up sixty blunts, it's bout to be a showdown
You ain't never been to a shindig till you come kick it with Wyte
Bout to turn up and get three high, my house party tonight

[Hook:]
I've got a keg on ice, sprite and two pints
Suits cocaine and I don't even do white
We bout to have a house party, house party, house party
House party tonight
Enough liquor to kill a bull
Bring your home girls, it's cool
But leave your bathing suits at home
We skinny dipping in the pool
We bout to have a house party, house party, house party
House party tonight

[Verse 2:]
Cars are parked around the block
I know my neighbors called the cops
People packing in this bitch tonight
We're not about to stop
Boxing matches in the back yard
A bonfire and beer-pong
Ambulance on deck, if you can't take it up in here long
I go hard or I go home, I'm home now, let's go harder
You pass by and don't like what's goin' on Keep rollin', don't bother
I've got this in complete control, at least I do for now
Shit, I feel this mollie kicking in, I'm bout to join the crowd
Keg stand, triple shot of Crown and bars to wash it down
I really can't believe I haven't already been bared from my own town
I'm Lil Wyte, but known to the MPD as the party animal of Memphis
I'm your host, mi casa su casa, enjoy the evening, bitches

[Hook:]
I've got a keg on ice, sprite and two pints
Suits cocaine and I don't even do white
We bout to have a house party, house party, house party
House party tonight
Enough liquor to kill a bull
Bring your home girls, it's cool
But leave your bathing suits at home
We skinny dipping in the pool
We bout to have a house party, house party, house party
House party tonight
