[Intro - DJ Paul]

I don't believe you'll do... we don't believe you...
Yeah... yeah... finish It!... what!..

[Hook - Lil' Wyte]
Will you beat 'em to the flo' in the club?! (I sho will!)
Will you jack 'em even if they ain't dub?! (I sho will!)
If he actin' like a bitch!, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch!
If he actin' like a bitch!, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch!

[Verse One - Lil' Wyte]
You motherfuckers want two colors? I got white and I got black
That'll bury you motherfuckers comin' soon as I step off in the track
If you actin' like a bitch, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch
If this hater got stomped to the floor, thank to god for all this shit
Frayser Bizzo DJ Pizzo L Whizzo and Hypnotizzo
Run the bizzo fo' shizzo roll up another blunt my nizzo
I got to maintain, I got to get changed
I got to rip this mic, from California to Maine
And take it over to Spain, send it to the Dominicans
Tell 'em to examine it and start jammin' all of my sinitist
Make sure that they remember this, like if it was some religious shit
The white, gold, ghetto, platinum, rap hoggin', I'm rippin it
And take it to the bank, get to deposit it, take a slip and fill it out
Runnin' for thirty thousand turn around and shove it in your mouth
You reviewing Hypnotize and you'll see nothing but potential
People gettin' beat to the flo' and it all started with a pencil

[Hook - Lil' Wyte]
Will you beat 'em to the flo' in the club?! (I sho will!)

[Verse Two - Lil' Wyte]
Check it out I'm new on the scene, Lil' Wyte lighted with gasoline
Fire breathin' gettin' closer to the grass that isn't green
Which means your team is piled over in the back
Sixteen bars on the side and knowledge on every track
Holdin' it down, never happenin', gettin' my crown, keep on rappin'
And even at 75 I'mma still be able to work my magic
Beater, I'm pacin in front of the next new generation
Rising legacy shinin' the cross of soberbination
Need a passport and luggage and a new wardrobe
Fifty billion but I will settle for 2.4
Check the scans I'm the man in this independent land
No video or no single countin' g's like I be damned
This white cat can rap and put on a good show
It's funny how this music can put me down to the flo'
I got to give it raw I got to give it dirty
What ever city you reppin' beat 'em down if you heard me

[Hook - Lil' Wyte]
Will you beat 'em to the flo' in the club?! (I sho will!)
Will you jack 'em even if they ain't dub?! (I sho will!)
If he actin' like a bitch!, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch!
If he actin' like a bitch!, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch!

Will you beat 'em to the flo' in the club?! (I sho will!)
Will you jack 'em even if they ain't dub?! (I sho will!)
If he actin' like a bitch!, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch!
If he actin' like a bitch!, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch!

[Verse Three - Lil' Wyte]
See I done seen the brighter days with plenty hating rays
My album hit a hundred thousand now shit been going my way
I give my props to my pops give my props to my mouth
Give my props to the camp give my props to the south
Now I'm drunk and I'm high but I bet you already knew it
You buck as me you buck as us and we twice as buck as u
Security started movin' to the middle of the crowd
Only if he got a gun I agree to shut it down
I ain't trying to get shot by no motherfucking punk
I know by days this shit too many drinkin' and all of a sudden crunk
Pick me up let me out blow me up and bump me loud
Too many styles be coming up out of me that when I break I hit the crowd
I have a high page game face eye balls poppin' out
With this shit tryin' to stay awake what you think?
Only cracker good enough to be down with the six
Clearly understood that this is some original gangsta shit

[Hook - Lil' Wyte]
Will you beat 'em to the flo' in the club?! (I sho will!)

If he actin' like a bitch!, we gon' treat 'em like a bitch!

Will you beat 'em to the flo' in the club?! (I sho will!)
