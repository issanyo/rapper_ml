[Verse 1: Derez]
Flash flicker, better clear the section out, schizo maid, so don't mess with thou
Yeah I bang with, ride with, slide with, call it Gangnam how them hoes just check my style
I ball, I fall, get up, so you ain't gon' see me on that bench on camera
Like a Coke Boy in a Maybach tongue kissin' Miley or Hannah, I'll French Montana
Gather all the clocks up in the room, and watch what I do so you know that its every time
Nigga, never mind, I'm promo, why the fuck I gotta say YOLO if I never die
Arizone the home, its no thang, told ya chrome alone is so sane
Holdin' the totem pole, the whole game, supposed I'm cocaine, that blow can blow brains
Better check it, you haters, never mention a player
We the unit, Got my law in order, leave em special victims like Benson and Stabbler, I'm heinous
So tainted, I'm dead ass, I'll leave ya dead ass in ya next class
Better check that, and the shoes so negro fly cus them colors is jet black
Setback, who the fuck wanna get clapped? Like a pop beat, clap clap, get that
Who be wilin', profilin', a nigga violent and silent, when I'm inside it, I'm stylin' and they respect that.. bitch
