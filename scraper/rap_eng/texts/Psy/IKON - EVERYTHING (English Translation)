Where are you?
I’m writing a letter that I can’t send
I was alone and swaying
Even longing feels romantic
Please remember
You may feel small in this world
But you’re so beautiful to me
You’re my everything, you’re my world

Even after countless time
There’s a face I always miss
Even this momentary loneliness
Is a gift you left behind
Times I spent with you
Were all so bright like early morning
I realize, the universe I was so curious about back then
It was you

I can’t reach you anymore
So I’m writing down the memories on a small letter

Some day, some day
Even if it all
Gets forgotten
You, who was with me

Everything, to me you are
Everything everything

When you’re tired
You can always look back
Even if it’s endless
Even if it’s tearful
Waiting is happiness to me

The world is cruel
What’s beautiful always withers
Even the moonlight
Even the flowers
But I pray the memories will last forever

I hope you’re happy
As much as you struggled
I’m not good enough for you
Don’t meet someone like me
Meet someone who’ll shine on you
And make you smile
After time passes, if you come back to me
I’ll be that kinda guy

I can’t reach you anymore
So I’m writing down the memories on a small letter

Some day, some day
Even if it all
Gets forgotten
You, who was with me

Everything, to me you are
Everything

You’re the one who made me live
Good bye
Like a midsummer night’s dream
Good bye

You’re the one who made me live
Good bye
Like a midsummer night’s dream
Good bye

Everything
