Our things, our taste, the precious things are alive
If I have taken out my sword, at least slice up some radish
If I don't see the end, I tremble with anger
Even if you get far from your dream
Don't ever get sad and just run - you're still young
It's not over until it's over
They do it till the end, Korean people
Everyone get up, right now, get up
Everyone get up, a big thing is happening
Lift it and get up, right now lift it and get up
Lift it and get up, then that is Korea
Korea, louder - Korea, louder
Korea, harder - Korea oh oh oh
The music is ringing, the music is ringing
The shouts of 50,000,000 are ringing and spreading
Yaya, yayayaya, yayayayayayaya oh oh oh
Who dares to test me? That test will be dangerous
If I say I'll do it, I'll do it - Once I do it, it's tremendous
The shouts of the 50,000,000 are our sound
It's the shout of the Korean peninsula - Korea
It's not over until it's over
They do it till the end, Korean people
Everyone get up, right now, get up
Everyone get up, a big thing is happening
Lift it and get up, right now lift it and get up
Lift it and get up, then that is Korea
Korea, louder - Korea, louder
Korea, harder - Korea oh oh oh
The music is ringing, the music is ringing
The shouts of 50,000,000 are ringing and spreading
Yaya, yayayaya, yayayayayayaya oh oh oh
