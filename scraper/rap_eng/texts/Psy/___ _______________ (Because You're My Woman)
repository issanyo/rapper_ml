[이승기의 내 여자라니까 가사]

나를 동생으로만
그냥 그정도로만
귀엽다고 하지만

누난 내게 여자야
니가 뭘 알겠냐고
크면 알게 된다고

까분다고 하지만
누난 내게 여자야
누나가 누굴 만나든지
누굴 만나 뭘 하든지

난 그냥 기다릴뿐
누난 내 여자니까
너는 내 여자니까

너라고 부를께
뭐라고 하든지
남자로 느끼도록

꽉 안아줄께
너라고 부를께

뭐라고 하든 상관없어요
놀라지 말아요

알고보면
어린 여자라니까

어딜 갔다 왔는지
어디가 아픈건지 슬퍼보이네요

누나답지 않네요
무슨일 있냐고 무슨일이냐고

말해보라 했더니
머릴 쓰다듬네요

누가 누나를 울린다면
그 누가 됐건간에

난 절대 참지 않아
누난 내 여자니까

너는 내 여자니까
너라고 부를께 뭐라고 하든지

슬픔이 잊혀지도록
꽉 안아줄께

너라고 부를께 뭐라고 하든 상관없어요
내품에 안겨요
알고보면 여린 여자라니까

좋아하니까 이러는 거겠지
이러면 안되는거 알아요

좋아하니까
좋아하니까

누난 내여자니까
너는 내 여자니까

네게 미쳤으니까
미안해 하지마

난 행복하니까 널
바라만 봐도

난 눈물이 흘러
너라고 부를께

뭐라고 하든 상관없어요
곁에만 있어요

결국엔 넌 내
여자라니까

[English Translation}

Only as a dongseng, just that much you think I'm adorable
But noona you are woman to me
You say "what do you know?" "you'll understand when you're older"
You say that I'm acting rashly but noona you re a woman to me
No matter who you meet or whoever you meet and no matter what you do
I can only wait

Because noona is woman, because you are my woman

I'll call you by you, no matter what you say
So that you can feel me as a man, I'll hold you tightly
I'll call you by you. No matter what you say, I don't care
Don't be surprised
If you really look, you are a young girl

Where have you gone? Where do you hurt?
You look sad. Noona, it doesn't suit you
When I ask you "has something happened?"
"What happened", you just tousle my hair
If someone makes noona cry
Whoever that might be I'm not going to stand it

Because noona is my woman, becaue you are my woman

I'll call you by you, no matter what you say
So that you can forget your sadness, I'll hold you tightly
I'll call you by you. No matter what you say, I don't care
Be in my embrace
If you really look, you are a young girl

Becaue I like you I must be doing this
I know that this isn't right
Because I like you.. Because I like you..
Because noona is my woman, because you are my woman
Because you drive me insane

Don't be sorry, because I'm happy
Even if I look at you, I shed tears
I'll call you by you. No matter what you say, I don't care
Just be my side

In the end I'm telling you you are my woman
