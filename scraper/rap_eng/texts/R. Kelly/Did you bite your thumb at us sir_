Let rope gang gang bang yo bitch foe the culture then I won't complain
She'll gimme brain I'm taking strains of the jane
Aye shout out dame
Whipping and whipping caught a sprain
No one sees you crying in the rain
Sipping codeine not champagne but I'm still mami's papi and she gimme sloppy toppy
Try to stop me but you'll never top me
YUH YUH YUH
Hating on me since LSD I'm part of 2 collectives
U wilding out online we wilding out at our shows
Imma put you on a leash for the bitch u is
Bet you this'll be better than yo whole career it is clear that your end is really near
Wow what a wonderful year it has been for me , for my team from the pills to the clout
This ain't over night u got put in work day in day out
Thought it was a drought ?
Little bro don't have a single doubt u know what I'm about
Drop a single then I air it out
