[Verse 2: DRIP-OG]

I told my rose flower to come over for the night She was looking sexy in a top with black tights I keep her like a souvenir coz I got the rights making deep love in dark with no lights it was so perfect that every moment was nice Dated for a while & we had to pay the price cooking Dope lines in the Kitchen with spice Double cup a lot with the backets in my ice prayed to Jesus Christ’s for the Checks not the Stripes coz nigga’s these days want the money more than life I rather stay broke than going to row the Dice coz they don’t wanna see me shine but I was born for the light
