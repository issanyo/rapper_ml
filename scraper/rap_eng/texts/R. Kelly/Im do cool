Yeah I'm so cool that I go swimming in a pool
My brothers so ugly that he makes me wanna study
Yeah yeah
He bangs on door that just wants me to go to every ugly store
Because I'm so cool, I get too go swimming I'm my baby pool
I'm a better rapper but he's a better hacker
I wear so cool clothes that just wants him to go to koles
My friend is Steve but guess what all he has is little stupid sleeve
Ha now that were done he just became a bum
