[Verse 1]
I got to have a shot of what you got is oh so sweet
You got to make it hot, like a boomerang I need a repeat

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin', all your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin', don't let up until we're through

[Verse 2]
You got to whip it up and hit me like a ton of lead
If I blow my top will you let it go to your head

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin', all your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin', don't let up until we're through

[Verse 3]
You got to move it up and use it like a screwball would
You got to pack it up, work it like a new boy should

[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin', all your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin', don't let up until we're through
