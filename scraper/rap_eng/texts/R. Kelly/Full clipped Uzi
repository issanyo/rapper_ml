[Verse 2: DRIP-OG]

Give me my respect when I drop my hard lines coz in the booth how we fight are the punch lines Best crew to ever do this only good vibes but we aggressive in the streets like the Bad guys teachers always hatted coz I was the wise guy and now I connect to the money like it’s WiFi Nigga’s probably making losses and getting high but am the realist in the Game and am so fly I ain’t going back to Broke you can ask why i started making music every day till I die and all my nigga’s are gonna make and so am I stay true to yourself and ask who am I?
