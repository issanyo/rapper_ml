Rain drop drop top can you not
With the scrub pants without the top
Trying to bring vintage back girl please stop
With your dance moves that lack like Kidz Bop
Bout time you get a watch Kesha, Tik Tok
And realize that the notch issa big flop
You've grown to like lash extensions you must have forgot
You're prone to eye infections you like Fetty Wap

How you go from Pilots to Uzi in 3.5
Pop-rock to Hip-hop whole life is a lie
Red Rover's how you tend girl pick a side
You heathen, are you really about that tour llif3?
Now I guess that's what it means to be with the times
Go from Sydney White to Blac like Amanda Bynes
Fat transfers-injections for a bigger behind
Kardashian ass that don't match the thighs

Talking bout a blackberry flavored rubber
Now suddenly you're and ebony lover
Just one taste and now you want to discover
The night rider life from which you'll never recover
I hear your friends nicknamed you the color wheel
Like Baskin Robins-all 32 flavor's the deal
Chocolate issa snack, butter chicken's a whole meal
Picking a color is your achilles heel

Stonehenge with a bumpit, up on Mount Rushmore
Stone head on a summit, sky high you soar
Lingo is your hustle, you a slang whore
Nobody wanna hear it, check it at the door
You got Street Talk for Dummies at the palm of your hand
Urban dictionary bookmarked and at your command
Ebonics 101 has become your brand
Your whole vocabulary's due for a reprimand

Don't even get me started with your temp tattoos
Took you 2 weeks to rid them looking like a damn tool
You know you too soft, you a goody two shoe
Go to bed baby boo it's passed your curfew
2 girls one cup's your new drinking game
Bottoms up, a real shitty night of shame
You oblivious, your naivety needs to stop
You'd probably go and order blue waffles at IHOP

You think your gram page if fire like you living the dream
The only thing that's fire's your eye; pink eye queen
Got posts from frat parties always looking for trouble
Disney star looking ass an Emma Roberts stunt double
With your cringeworthy foodie posts of poutine
Spend your gravy to get fried cus that's your routine
We live in a dope world so don't try to be subtle
When they call you a D-girl don't even try to rebuttal
