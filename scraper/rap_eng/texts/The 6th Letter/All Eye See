[Intro]
Uh on the records (at this time state your full name)
I don’t want to ya’ll know my full name fuck you (address)
You know that fuck you (telephone number) fuck you
You know that (I don’t know your telephone number)
Well Imma say fuck you, what's that a charge (date of birth Mr. ?)
Imma  say fuck you got that down on paper
I don’t want to co-operate I don’t want to co-operate
Why ya’ll placing me under arrest
And fuck you cause ya’ll just rolled up on the scene
And you looking at me crazy

[Verse 1]
Yea yea it’s like uh huh
Segregation looking out the window
This the reason what I see mmm let them know
Shout like is this justice or just us getting bomb rushed
Cuffed up what’s up besides stars and the cosmic
Then she say baby what’s the cause of something
If bullets the cause of death what’s the cause of love
Is it the cause of life or the cause of trusting gold
They know they trying to speak the truth but it’s like
Monkey see monkey do and I ain’t on the television or cable
Niggas couldn't walk in my shoes if we trade souls
Let alone trace souls cause my J’s cold born singer like I’m J Cole
Print gold bricks with the biggie my face on the Sphinx
These things got pulled like stage coats stage shows
Glorious pay rolls like the glory of rain dows of the explorer
Of the mind and corona with the flames close we living a
Halo till we see you hello games on

[Hook]
But all I see everyday
Young black niggas getting shot
And the police getting away
All I see everyday
Just another reason why
All these dollar signs got to be made
Yo I got so many obstacles I got a lot to do
And I got a lot to prove
Everything going cycles including the earth
My mind is playing like the universe

[Verse 2]
You can check it out ya’ll uh
Before I die I got to see the black man rise
But til then we just keep six foot and triple 6
Staying case close to whip to where the world lit
Climp floors four door taurus with black mores cut my
Odor and roll up and I use the force pull the OG’s out
Of town work got the flaunts serving restaurants
Careers rocket launch MC’s chicken I got a lot of sauce
On me homicidal diet lost so oh shit they trying to frost
On my title song joining the level concourse photogenic
Goddess body banging want an encore said it’s like crackin
My pipe she call me five four all day staircase hallway fall lake
Read between the lines nigga cognate keep this short day
Baby banging we just trying to pass the patty gray

[Hook]
But all I see everyday
Young black niggas getting shot
And the police getting away
All I see everyday
Just another reason why
All these dollar signs got to be made
Yo I got so many obstacles I got a lot to do
And I got a lot to prove
Everything going cycles including the earth
My mind is playing like the universe

[Verse 3]
Uh yea another day another black man shot
It’s fucked up out here God when this shit going to stop
Because if ain’t by our brother we getting slayed by the cops
Like when the pain going to stop so I stay with some pack
Blow a branch for my bredrins going back to the essence
And this shit called life is like a curse/blessing enough stressing
But still I’m never half stepping change my mind is a weapon that
That detonate any second that mental ammunition bubbling
You should do the same yo I know it’s hard struggling
And oppressed by governments same one that birth the crack
That you smuggling trying to please all have the glyphs on the wall
To my niggas carrying heat is the diffense from the law
It’s about to go down we claiming the gold now so around
Comes around and this life is continuous
Every ignorance is the main thing

[Hook]
All I see everyday
Young black niggas getting shot
And the police getting away
All I see everyday
Just another reason why
All these dollar signs got to be made
Yo I got so many obstacles I got a lot to do
And I got a lot to prove
Everything going cycles including the earth
My mind is playing like the universe
