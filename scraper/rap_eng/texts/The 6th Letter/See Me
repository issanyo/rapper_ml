[Hook] (BriskInTheHouse)
Aye Yo ,with all this drama in the world right now I find it hard just to be me
When I see God I see me, I ain't feeling the odds but
Get past that shit without spilling my heart
Black arts do magic, no trick up my sleeve
Make moves I knew, id pick up and leave
Raw like the sun rays on peace
Just shining, you better go get your sunscreen
Good Jesus
If there really was a second coming it would be me
I talk to the dead without using a ouiji
Real darkness, this shit gets deep
There's nowhere in the world, that a nigga ain't reached
How I feel got to lock it away for safekeeps
The price of a soul right now just ain't cheap
I got spirits making noise in my room, I can't sleep

Aye Yo ,with all this drama in the world right now I find it hard just to be me
Yo When I see God I see me
When I see god I see me x2
