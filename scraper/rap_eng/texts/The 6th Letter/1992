[Verse 1]
I take a hit of tha weed and catapult to tha pinnacle, Way past tha physical
Ya raps nd whole style is pitiful, So quit it (Ugh)
I'll make ya tape sound like an interval, Now dig it (Yeah)
I'm breakin shit down to tha minerals
Funky syllables hittin ya equilibrium
When I be kickin them phat raps all over tha track
And yes, I represent tha north side of tha map (Yup)
T dot O, One time where you at?
Flippin crack out tha traps in tha hood, Couldn't picture that (Nahh)
So I put tha crack on wax, Started pitchin that
24/7 (Yup), Never looked back
I gots tha green, Who got tha snaps on tha snacks?
And tha flows like wasabi, Ain't nobody cold as I be (Nope)
Cause most these niggas rappin, Fakin tha funk and lookin sloppy, Like Joe's
I eat em up I got tha munchies
Then sip tha juice, Play tha cut hella comfy
Like...


[Hook]
1 to da 2 to da 3 da 4
Who da nigga wit tha supafunkyplayalistic flow
It be I wit that shit that'll make em bounce fasho
No lie for that loot I put it down you know
Supa funky...

*LOTUG SAMPLE*
Cause I'm comin wit that funk like I juss don't care (x4)


[Verse 2]
Ayo I talk jewels, Spit diamonds, I been shinin
And tha crew PHAT, Show me a rapper that ain't grindin in it (Point em out)
Bound to be prominent, Tha flow so dominant
I might kidnap ya girlfriend and make her wobble it (Ugh), Then make her swallow dick (Ugh)
Better keep an eye on her nigga (Why?), Cause every damn move she be followin
She love me, But tha feelin ain't mutual
If you didn't know, I be all about gettin dough
I be kickin it wit tha homies and it's like that, So gon take a few pulls and send it right back
I'm makin moves, Makin motion (Yup)
Flowin like an ocean (Yup)
Couple pulls of that bomb piff got em open (C'mon)
Like books when you read em
Dapper than ever's how ya see him (Ugh)
Wolf Grey 5's wit tha ice cold 3M on tha print
Roll a spliff, Po' tha sip, Represent
Was born in 92 and been cold ever since


[Hook]
1 to da 2 to da 3 da 4

No lie for that loot I put it down you know
