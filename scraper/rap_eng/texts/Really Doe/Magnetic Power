[Hook: Jennifer Hudson](4x)
You’ve got a search magnetic power
That just keeps holding me down
Ooh ooh ooh

[Verse: Really Doe]
God did his thang must have snapped his fingers twice
Definition of a life, reason why I’m like
That’s why I never hesitate to call you my wife
Support you found in Christ
Just ain’t find a church I like
I know in order to see right, I need light
Even if we fuss and fight its all good by the night
I know it’s kinda hard I live like the flight
I just want my kids kids to be aight
And this corrupt world gave me a baby girl
Make sure she need no man for them diamond and pearls
Remember worst days we used to share [?]
But we go back like plastic caps with curls
Too drunk to drive take over I gotta hurl
Raise the window down that’s the fresh to fresh air
Tripping in the truck like “That ain’t my hair!”
I want to fly to thank you just for being there cause
You (4x)

[Hook](4x)
