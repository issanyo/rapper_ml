[Chorus]
Baby I just need a rider, a rider
I need you right beside me, right beside me
Baby I can take you higher, higher, higher
Baby I just need a rider, a rider
I need you right beside me, right beside me
Baby I can take you higher, higher, higher
Baby I just need a rider, a rider
I need you right beside me, right beside me
Baby I can take you higher, higher, higher

[Verse]
Ain't no question girl, you a rider forsure
I need someone who's down for me
Through my highs and my lows
We're just lost in the city, still ain't got nowhere to go
So we're just riding around, taking it slow
Look, blessings
I'm just counting my blessings
Baby, I just need a break
Need to get away, I been stressin'
You been all on my mind
I need you by my side though
Pretty face and them thick legs
But I'm really feeling your vibe though
Girl, I just need me a rider
Need you right here beside me
Girl just tell me you're down for me baby, I'll take you higher
Look, roll up, let's ride, you know a nigga from the west side
Have you feeling like cloud 9
I'ma take you up where the jets fly, look

[Bridge]
Just riding through the city when I seen you
Told you I was only meant for you, I'll never leave you
Girl, you know you always on my mind, you know I need you
Girl I need you, need you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I need more love, less doubts
Had to go and cut my ex out
Momma told me I'm too young
And I'm too blessed to be stressed out
Baby I just need real love, you know the type you just feel loved
I just need me a rider chick that Jada Pinkett that will love
So tell me girl is you down?
I just need me a ride or die
I just need me a girl to talk about getting money instead of getting high
Up in a plane, up in the sky and Henny still in my system
Baby girl you everything I been missing

[Chorus]
Baby I just need a rider, a rider
I need you right beside me, right beside me
Baby I can take you higher, and higher, higher
Baby I just need a rider, a rider
I need you right beside me, right beside me
Baby I can take you higher, and higher, higher
Baby I just need a rider, a rider
I need you right beside me, right beside me
Baby I can take you higher, and higher, higher
