[Intro]
I got my game from the man who lived his life on the block
Gave me some advice so i listened when he talked he said
"keep living you life cause time never stops one day we all go
Whether you like it or not". he told me i ain't trynna live this
Way no more but i guess it's too late. ain't seen nobody smile at me in so long
Til i seen your face , and my eyes no longer have tears, mouth no longer has
Taste, my heart no longer has love, but my soul is still in the right place
My eyes no longer have tears, mouth no longer has taste , heart no longer has love
But my soul is still in in the right place. & thats all that matters

[Verse 1]
I could see the pain inside the eyes of a killer
Never show my feelings put them to the side
Conceal them, they trynna kill us
I'll never run the darkness 'cause I see peace in the furious, love in the heartless
Time is moving so fast, I been on my own path
Shout out to the cats just hoping this last line of coke lasts
I dont condone but yo' I feel your pain
It's like we ain't got shit to lose but ain't got shit to gain
It's the same
Every second, every day of the month, hooker on the corner trynna feed a baby for once
Money is the root of all evil, but everybody needs it. know some cats who kill for it
Know some who wouldn't keep it
Know some cats to give half to the church and thank Jesus
And for the right amount i know some girls you can sleep with
Baby I got my game from the man who lived his life on the block
Gave me some advice so i listened when he talked he said
"keep living you life cause time never stops one day we all go
Whether you like it or not". he told me i ain't trynna live this
Way no more but i guess it's too late. ain't seen nobody smile at me in so long
Til i seen your face , and my eyes no longer have tears, mouth no longer has
Taste, my heart no longer has love, but my soul is still in the right place
My eyes no longer have tears, mouth no longer has taste , heart no longer has love no
But my soul is still in in the right place. thats all that matters
Often misunderstoood probably cas they can't relate to me
Seen so many faces they starting to look the same to me
Friendships break apart , girlfriends turn to exs
Life is a test but im still learning my lesson
Never the less its kinda stressful when niggas out to get you
And all you trying to do is to show the world you got potential
But no one gives a fuck about the struggles you been through unless
You handing them money and its not coincidental
When you at the bottom you get left in the dust
Dont put your hand out cas ain't nobody helping you up
I got 2 feet one choice and no other options
And when you at the bottom you can still see where the top is
