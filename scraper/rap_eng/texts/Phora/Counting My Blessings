I'm counting my blessings
I'm counting my blessings
Counting my blessings
Said "I'm counting my blessings"
Counting my blessings
Just counting my blessings
Counting my blessings
Said "I'm counting my blessings"
Keep counting my, keep counting my
I keep counting my, I keep counting my

[Verse 1]
Momma always said I was an angel
And now i know my purpose in this world
So I just want to say thank you
Thank you to the fans who showed me
It was alright to be myself, I'd be lying if I said y'all didn't help
Need to be successful and put food up on the table
We owe this to the fans, didn't need no record label
They asked how we we're different and I just said:
"These rappers all forgot one thing, that's how to be grateful"
Tell your fans thank you
You keep saying you don't understand
But it's probably cause this music didn't save you
These people don't want to hear about your money
Your bitches, your clothes, and your cars
They want music they to relate to
I let them know they're not alone in every single track
And when the world is against them, they know I got their back
See I see them as family, like motherfuck a grammy
I'm just trying to save a life with my music homie
And that see that's the type of feeling that money can't buy
This life is too short to not try
We all angels in disguise
But because you got broken wings doesn't mean you can't fly
Money can't buy
This life is too short to not try
We all angels in disguise
But because you got broken wings doesn't mean you can't fly

[Verse 2]
See, I ain't scared to put my feelings out in the open
I ain't scared to show these people all my emotions
But tell the truthIi always used to want to fix something
About me then I realized I wasn't broken
I was just too worried about what other people thought
And what they say
We all go through stress, we all go through pain
Just last December I was sitting in the rain
Feeling like I wasn't good enough and that drove me insane
Till' I realized that I had a purpose
See everyone is special but nobody is perfect
We all got imperfections I know you been stressin'
But keep doing your best it's all gonna be worth it
You see I put my life into this music
I ain't got nothing to hide from
My father might of made me but I'm god's son
Never met a person with no flaws
Please tell me when you find one
I'm counting all my blessings till' the job's done
Cause my heart's been broken way to many times to count
But that dont stop me from trying
Cause if I can still love with a broken heart
Broken wings can't stop me from flying
The fans always gave me a reason
They stuck to my side when everybody was leaving
Yourstruly and God man, that's all we believe in
So I represent Yourstruly till' the day I stop breathing
You gave me a reason
You stuck to my side when everybody was leaving
Yourstruly and god man that's all we believe in
So I represent Yourstruly till' the day I stop breathing
