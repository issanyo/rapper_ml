[Verse 1]
Yeah, life, I don't know what it means
All I know is when it's over, you're free
See my boy caught a bullet inside his chest
I'm just hoping he breathes
I'm just hoping he was lucky as me
But I really hate to say it, man
Hope just ain't enough sometimes
I've been moving fast, be pressing my luck sometimes
My grandpa passed away, I never got to say my goodbyes
Wish I could see him again even for just one time
And I promise, I won't say "I'm busy" or make excuses
And I won't show up late and leave early like I used to
And I won't take the word you said for granted, I would use them
But why we never show how much we love 'em til' we lose them?
Slow down..

[Chorus]
I just think I need to slow down
I just think I need to slow it down
I just think I need to slow down
I just think I need to slow it down
You feel, what I feel
I think I'm moving way too fast
Lately, fast lately
Homie, I've been tryna slow down, slow down
Homie, I've been tryna slow down, slow down
Homie, I've been tryna slow down, slow down
Down, down
Homie I've been tryna slow down, slow down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, to me you worth more than the stars and the planets
This for all the times that I took you for granted
This for all the times I ain't never had time
Missed you on your birthday, I know that we planned it
I was too into myself to love those around me
Drowning in my loneliness hoping it don't surround me
Swallow me whole and drown me
I lost myself and you found me
You the only one that pushed me
When everybody would doubt me
Since a kid
Mama ad my back through all the crazy shit I did
Mama, you responsible for everything this is
Mama, but I been really tryna change the way I live, I'ma
They way I live, I'ma
Show you why I appreciate you, take the time
But you know the son of yours just couldn't wait to shine
She said, "You so focused on taking on the world that you forgot your hometown
You been moving too fast, you really need to slow down"
And that's real..

[Chorus]
I just think I need to slow down
I just think I need to slow it down
I just think I need to slow down
I just think I need to slow it down
You feel, what I feel
I think I'm moving way too fast
Lately, fast lately
Homie, I've been tryna slow down, slow down
Homie, I've been tryna slow down, slow down
Homie, I've been tryna slow down, slow down
Down, down
Homie, I've been tryna slow down, slow down
