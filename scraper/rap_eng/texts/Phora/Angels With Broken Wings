[Verse 1]
Sometimes it seems like, like there ain't nothing left
Sometimes I feel like, I'm just wasting my breath
Sometimes it seems like, like there ain't nothing left
No matter how hard I try, I just
I can't seem to get away, I can't seem to get away
They said I'm just an angel with broken wings
And we living just to die, chasing hopeless dreams
No matter how hard I try, I just

[Chorus]
I say "fuck love"
Cause whats love, when they don't love you back?
I say "fuck love"
Cause whats love, when they don't love you back?
Yeah, I say "fuck love"
Cause whats love, when they don't love you back?
I say "fuck love" cause what's love, what's love..

[Verse 2]
When you can't feel no more
Yeah I'm drinking til I can't feel no more
Straight out the bottle til I can't feel no pain
My heart is hollow dog I can't feel no shame, no shame
So don't call my motherfucking phone no more
Just leave me alone I can do this shit on my own
So don't call my motherfucking phone no more
Just leave me alone

[Outro]
No matter how hard I try, I just
No matter how hard I try, I just
They said I'm just an angel with broken wings
No matter how hard I try, I just
