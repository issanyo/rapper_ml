[Verse 1]
I said I'm doing donuts in my black Toyota
Repping for my city just in case they didn't know us
I ain't one to brag and I hate to say I told ya, but we did it again
Living it up, we back motherfucker, yeah we in this
Yours truly nigga, mind your business
And I don't rock no fancy clothes, it doesn't spark my interest
Nah, I'm more like the type of person to rock
The dirtiest kicks, but have the cutest girl in the spot
Real talk, what's money if you got no soul?
And what's a man with no goals, homie I don't know
These niggas is acting phony, always calling me homie
But eventually they true colors all gon' show
It don't take much, I'm swifter than Picasso with the paint brush
Hammer with the flows, it's that MC that you can't touch
Wait up, look at these niggas that stay hating
We making moves, taking no breaks and no vacations
Not a dollar in my pocket, made three albums
Off a hundred dollar microphone, recording in my closet
Never made excuses man, we just went out and got it
No stopping if they talking, I guarantee we the topic
Nigga what

[Hook]
Fuck what they say, them niggas talk too much
I ain't tripping though, cause ain't nothing different
Nothing different, I ain't tripping, niggas talk too much
Fuck what they say, fuck you too if you don't fuck with us

[Verse 2]
Listen, this wise man speak, yeah I'm soaking up game
Niggas talking 'bout me, I hope they choke on my name
I'm focused on winning, y'all niggas is focused on women
No game, the most that you could do is hope that you get it
See I don't even need to chase it
Cause what you need to understand is
When you chase success, the women come along with it
Don't stress it kid, it's that young attention deficit
Never had much, but yo I always made the best of it
The big question is, you ready or not?
Cause even if you ain't, I promise you we never gon' stop
Letting 'em talk, my girl has more fans than you niggas
'Bout the peace, but yo she just might get a hand of you niggas
Nah I'm playing, but really I feel bad for you niggas
You couldn't bless the mic even if Jesus handed it to ya
Back with a vengeance for all the niggas asking the questions
I got one answer, I'm the future, past and the present
But I always give thanks to the one up above
Peace to my family and all the people showing me love
Making moves, burning rubber, you can smell the aroma
Doing donuts in my black Toyota motherfucker, what's up

[Hook]
Fuck what they say, them niggas talk too much
I ain't tripping though, cause ain't nothing different
Nothing different, I ain't tripping, niggas talk too much
Fuck what they say, fuck you too if you don't fuck with us
