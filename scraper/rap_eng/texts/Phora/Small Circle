I got a long road ahead of me, but I'm moving steadily
Tried to stay away from fake niggas and they jealousy
So best believe I keep my circle small
No time for bullshit, man I heard it all
I got a long road ahead of me, but I'm moving steadily

No time for bullshit, man I heard it all

Sometimes this life ain't what you always think
I'm running from the pain I never watch how much I drink
All these motherfuckers talkin' bout wassup with me
I'll be in your city soon, guess you gotta come and see
And lately I been stressing. I ain't sleeping comfortably
Maybe cause my ex told me she 'bout to have another me
But she got a man and I got a girl
And we ain't capable of raising a kid in this world
Man I just don't know what to do, I just don't now what the fuck to do
Cause im sick and tired of being sick and tired
I just wanna live my life, but everyday that passes by
Seems like nothing new
Same drama, same motherfuckers talking shit (they ain't walking)
Same haters all up on my dick
Worry about yourself and leave me alone
Momma' keeps telling me I need to be home
So I tell her ima visit soon, because she miss me and I miss her too
But we both know that I got shit to do
So I got "Forgive Me Mother" tattooed
Im bout to be a man soon
Despite your mistakes you could catch your dreams
Homie I'm living proof!
J craft taught me never stop till I accomplish
Shit "Haters Gonna Hate"
Yeah I know that's what sinonix said
And everyone I hang around,I learned from 'em
Never did nobody wrong, maybe they just didn't deserve nothing

Long road ahead of me, but I'm moving steadily, tried to stay away from fake niggas and they jealousy. so best
Believe I keep my circle small. no time for bullshit, man I heard it all (2x)

I seen so many friends turn to enemies
So many of the homies girlfriends tryna get with me
So many haters cause I'm someone that they'll never be
But I just let them be
Cause every fucking time they mention me
They only make me stronger, but they don't realize it
I have no hate for these niggas nah they just need some goddest
And when they talk shit
I think about 500 Benz that 2Pac was talkin' 'bout
And I just picture me inside it
All eyes on me! Nigga face the facts!
Even with the fame I still ain't got a steady place to crash
Cast used to diss me
Call me up trynna take it back
And I tell 'em is cool
Cause I know that I made mistakes in fact...
I know ive made way over my limit
But I'm hoping karma just gives me some
Fucking time to fix it
Cause they keep telling me not to change, but I swear Lord im trynna change

And its hard to not focus on the paper
When yo momma ain't got money for the bills
So I work my ass off till im drained
Next day do the same
Hoping next year I could move her to the hills
Yeah, move her to the hills (2x)
They tell me never sale out

But all my shows are sold out
And they ask me if I'm willing to die for it I say no doubt!
Only 17, and they probably don't understand..
Im still just a kid that's tryna become a man (2x)

I got a long road ahead of me, but im moving steadily
Tried to stay away from fake niggas and they jealousy
So best believe I keep my circle small
No time for bullshit, man I heard it all (2x)
