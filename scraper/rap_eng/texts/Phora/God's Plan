[Intro]
God gives the toughest battles to the strongest of his people
Just make sure you good with karma when it meets you
It's evil, it'll haunt you, it'll eat you
It'll take away your peace of mind and blind you and deceive you
Never let 'em get to your soul
Cause we all got a place in this world
We just might not know where to go
See, I'm here for a reason
And I'm right where I'm supposed to be
And all I know is that God is watching over me

[Verse 1]
Look, this life's a blessing for real
Jesus on my necklace, man the pressure is real
Ambulance and gunshots, ghetto bird on my block
Can't even trust the cops, they don't protect, they just kill
So pops told me, pack a weapon, for real
Cause the world is cold and they'll never respect how you feel
I know exactly what he meant when he said jealously kills
As I try to take a breath, but I feel like I'm choking on my own blood
Sick of these streets cause they show us no love
I'd have seen cats bag up drugs and slang to their own son
This shit ain't no fun
They're carrying heaters cause they got cold blood
They'll never see me weak and I won't run
Got to watch my back every motherfucking day
At the same time, never look back and look for a way to make it out these streets
Yeah, some people never make it out these streets

[Verse 2]
And they shooting at me, felt like a nightmare
Never understood why these cowards just couldn't fight fair
Always need a weapon, but this life is such a blessing
They pull the trigger, my guardian angel was sitting right there
You don't believe in God? Explain this
They killed my ass twice and I still lived and all it did was make me famous
And appreciate life in ways I couldn't explain
Bullet in my head a few inches away from my brain
Homie, I'm blessed to be alive and still breathing
But what's it going to take to show these people that I'm here for a reason?
I said I'm blessed to be alive and still breathing
But what's it going to take to show these people that I'm here for a reason?

[Verse 3]
One o'clock in the morning, heading back home
Driving down the freeway, just me and my girl
Talking 'bout our future, talking 'bout life
Talking 'bout these places that we trying to be in this world
As I look to my left, I seen a car approaching from a distance
And all I heard was, pop-pop-pop, What?
I'm tripping? Could this be a hit-man? They letting shots off
Went ninety off the freeway and dipped as soon as it popped off
Bullets burning in the back of my neck
Blood leaking down my back
Windows shattered as I'm gasping for breath
Bullets scorching as it ran through my flesh
Heart pumping, blood rushing
Felt the adrenaline pass through my chest
Thinking if I die tonight, they'll probably laugh at my death
But God has my back and that's why I'm blessed
I asked my girl if she was hit, but she was panicking
I checked her body, she was fine
But she seen I got shot and called the ambulance

[Verse 4]
Yeah, in the back of the ambulance
I just thought, "Are they following me?"
Did someone set me up? Is somebody plotting on me?
They trying to kill me, they really tried to kill me again
Don't wanna die without saying, "Bye" to my mama, my friends
Only twenty years old living in this world, so cold
Hoping my family don't have to see me go
I'm in the hospital fighting to survive
Fighting to stay alive
Doctors keep telling me not to close my eyes
They saying, "Stay with me. Deep breaths. Just breathe."
In and out, out and in, veins filled with IVs
I closed my eyes, thought of the skies and the trees
Asked God to bless me just one more time
Almost dropped to my knees
Now I'm back up on my feet, I should've died that night
Three shots from a .45 went through my ride that night
Hit me two inches from my spine, I could've been paralyzed
Guess you can say that destiny was by my side that night
I should've died that night
Three shots from a .45 went through my ride that night
Hit me two inches from my spine, I could've been paralyzed
Guess you can say that Destiny was by my side that night

[Verse 5]
Cause everybody wanna ride or die chick
But she the true meaning of ride or die when them bullets went right through my whip
Cause she was by my side the night I got hit
And still riding with me till the day I die
See, that's a wife, not a bitch
Just wanna see her happy, I'd give my life for that shit
I'd take a .45, a 9, even a knife for that shit
I know I wasn't perfect, we had our fights
But I'mma make things right cause we only got one life and that's it
But never let these cats take your peace of mind or your smile from you
No matter how hard they try, no matter what they try to do
I'll always be right there to the side of you
We got the choice to be happy or not
The only one that can decide is you
But sometimes I'm mad at myself
Sometimes I ask these people questions I can answer myself
Sometimes I wish I could show these cats how I felt
But I know karma's a motherfucking bitch and its gon' handle itself
Three people in my car that night
Me, Destiny, and God
Like, why the Lord keep letting me survive?
I'm so blessed that I'm alive
But truth is they could've put that bullet through my head
But dawg, legends never die
I said legends never die, I just want to be remembered
They can kill me, but that'll only mean I'll live forever
I said legends never die, I just want to be remembered
They can kill me, but that'll only mean I'll live forever
Motherfucker
