[Intro: Phora]
I mean it's just crazy man
What time does
Everything can change so fast

[Verse 1: Phora]
I remember back in the days
Tagging on trains not worried bout a word any cat had to say
We was cooler than the 40z we was sipping on
Going through the same situation in a different home
Two young cats struggling and stressing out
A lot of anger inside us we had to let it out
So painting walls was the only way we settled down
I always made you laugh you never let me frown
I was on house arrest you always used to come and see me
Brought your black book and markers cause we loved graffiti
In fact I loved it so much I did some time for it
But every time I got out you was by my side homie
And you remember when you got so wasted
I cleaned the barf off your pants and I wiped it off of yo face
And a couple hours before, Alejandra kissed you on the mouth
Yee you remember that one time in Carmen's house
No worries and no curfew
No drama til we started our own crew
Laughing at the toys who couldn't hang with us
Driving to the train yard bumping J Dilla
We was all about that hip hop, graff life
Never will I forget where I came from or act like
I'm better than anyone else, you was my nigga
I just hope you remember yourself
And how we were back then despite the way that we turned out
Shit was rough, graff started getting burnt out
So we stayed lowkey and started making music
I bought a microphone, you showed me how to use it
And from there on we started Yours Truly
Along came the fame
Along came the groupies
And with times comes change it upsets me to say
Time set us on our separate ways
I had a plan but you wasn't with that
We had our differences then you dropped a diss track
Having haters that's something that I can live through
But what hurt me is that after the shit we been through
You stabbed me in the back for no reason at all
You were the last person I trusted now I see through them all
You was my friend, was a brother to me
Over some rap shit, you ain't even fucking with me
I loved you like a brother and I still do
And I'll never forget the shit that we've been through
Cause I know you and very few know the real you
Bullshit aside no homo man I miss you

[Outro: Phora]
And I forgive ya
And I forgive ya
Yeah I forgive ya
And I forgive ya
Fuck the bullshit
Fuck all the drama
Keep moving on
Keep moving on
Gotta keep moving
Gotta keep moving
