[Verse 1: Phora]

C-A-L-I-FORN-I-A
I don't know where the fuck you've been
If you don't know my name
Phora tag on the wall so they know I came
I ain't got no sleep for the past four-five days
But I'm still asking around what's poppin tonight
And my boys said he's trying to paint a spot but I might
Go and kick it with my girl I always end up in some trouble G
But if you need some weed, hit my nigga Double G
Wanna see how the west rolls, then come with me
In the benz bumppin I got love and we drunk
Bumpin G fuck, 90 miles an hour over speed bumps
Yellin rest in peace NATE D-O-Double G
I'm bringing the funk back, the west was never dead
We were just having too much fun jack
I'm from that, sunny C-A and you must admit
We're getting down aren't we
If you're from the west, bump this at your house party nigga

[Hook: Phora]

Sunny California, Dime pieces and bomb bud
Throw yo fuckin dubs up, West Coast, West Coast
California, Dime pieces and bomb bud
Throw yo fuckin dubs up, West Coast, West Coast

[Verse 2: Phora]
Ain't nothing like that California weather
Summer breeze and palm trees, nothing feels better
Than the sand between your toes, and the mist from the ocean
Chillin at the beach with a dime piece smokin on a fattie
Yeah she calls me Papi not Daddy, Oh how I love these women
You meet in Cali, from the dark skin beauties to the thick latinas
Crazy white girls, can't forget ya'll neither
The only radio station I bump is K-DAY, 93.5 on the 1-0-1 freeway
With the windows down, my CD spinning
Catch me in your town you gonna see me grinnin
Cause I"m loving life and I ain't got no time for a hater
I'm just on the grind for some paper
West Coast tatted on my wrist, and if you got the outline of Cali
Tatted you the shit, crusin downtown under city lights
We rock chucks and white tees nigga get it right
Barbeques and Laker games, we just living life
But them beautiful Cali days can turn to wicked nights
So watch your back nigga

[Hook: Phora]

Sunny California, Dime pieces and bomb bud
Throw yo fuckin dubs up, West Coast, West Coast
California, Dime pieces and bomb bud
Throw yo fuckin dubs up, West Coast, West Coast

[Verse 3: Phora]

Look I say West, West (West, West)
Say West, West (West, West)
Say CALIF-ORN-I-A (CALIF-ORN-I-A)
CALIF-ORN-IA (CALIF-ORN-I-A)
Say West Coast (West Coast)
West Coast (West Coast)
Now say Sunny C-A (Sunny C-A)
Sunny C-A (Sunny C-A)
714 to the 562
818 always show love when I slide through
323 to the 626 ya'll know how to get down
To that West Coast shit
213 to 909, throw them fuckin dubs up when I roll by
619 to the 760, put that bitch in cruise control
And let it just roll, aye aye, let it just roll
Put that bitch in cruise control and let it just roll
Aye look, let it just roll, put that bitch
In cruise control and let it just roll

[Outro: Phora]
Yeah, let it just roll
Aye, let that bitch roll
Just let it roll, just let it roll
Sunny California is my home nigga
