[Verse 1]
Yeah, sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel I'm who they blame
Sometimes I feel like I ain't good enough
But I just look back at how far I came
Sittin' on my mama's couch, sippin' on a 40 ounce
All my family had was debt and overdrawn bank accounts
I never though I'd make it out, cousin tried to slang an ounce
Everywhere I went they always had shit to complain about
So I took my own route to see where life would take me
I didn't know much but I knew no one could replace me
All I had was music man and that's the shit that saved me
See this life is so crazy but I never let it change me
Cause the hood ain't never had our back
Streets ain't never had our back
Left us in the dust to rot what kind of fuckin' love is that
I rock my dirty Chuck's cause they was all I ever had
In junior high they called'em dirty looked at me and laughed
Couldn't sit with the kids with Jordan's all they did was brag
Made me feel like less than a man cause I wasn't popping tags
But momma said what you got inside is what matters
Now people ask why I decide to live my life as a rapper
But I ain't rapping I'm telling my story writing in chapters
I let my pen bleed on a page preach on the mic like a pastor
I'm past the bullshit and the drama, gave my life up to god
Just a story of a young kid fighting the odds
Look, yeah, gave my life up to god, just a story of a young kid

[Hook]
See what they tell you it don't mean nothing homie
Long as you know I believe in you homie
Cause we all got weaknesses homie
Don't let them stop you from dreamin' it homie
And what they tell you it don't mean nothing homie
Long as you know I believe in you homie
Cause we all got weaknesses homie
Don't let them stop you from dreamin' it homie

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this dream ain't come to me I had to go and chase it
Yeah I know I got my flaws but I got no replacements
I know the past is the past we just can't go and change it
So I dedicate this to my brother who just couldn't make it
Now I wash my pain away with Hennessy and Ace of Spades
Trynna take it day by day (Watching friends fade away)
Cause I guess people switch up when you least expect them to
I never lost the love I just lost my respect for you
Yeah I have my demons and I have my share of secrets
But having a heart and soul was my only fuckin' weakness
And my girl she want to leave and I don't blame her she got her reasons
But it's hard for me to trust anybody
She said she leaving and that's what she did
Sometimes this life doesn't give people a chance to forgive
They say that no one really know what true happiness is
But just remember man you only get back what you give
(Back what you give)
And to my lil homie sittin' in the park smokin' a blunt alone
Goin' through some bullshit with your moms
You had to run from home
Feel like no one understands but trust me man I fuckin' know
(I fuckin' know)
Cause I was scared to be a loser, scared that I would fail
Scared that I'd be six feet under ground or in a cell
Sometimes we hide behind this mask so scared to be ourselves
So scared that they can tell that we scared to live in this hell
But lately I'm dreamin' of heaven, gave my life up to god
Just a story of a young kid fighting the odds
Look, yeah, gave my life up to god, just a story of a young kid

[Hook]
See what they tell you it don't mean nothing homie
Long as you know I believe in you homie
Cause we all got weaknesses homie
Don't let them stop you from dreamin' it homie
And what they tell you it don't mean nothing homie
Long as you know I believe in you homie
Cause we all got weaknesses homie
Don't let them stop you from dreamin' it homie

[Verse 3]
I was always down to ride, no matter what would happen
Me I always had your back through the toughest traction
We was talkin' bout this rap shit like just imagine
A stadium packed with fans, yeah that was our fuckin' passion
You look out for me, and I'll look out for you
If you down with me then shit I'm down with you
All I ask for is loyalty respect me like a brother
See we from the same place nigga that's how we do
We ran the streets lookin' for something to find
Drinking 40's just to kill time and the stress on my mind
Plus we had a lot in common
All this anger there was plenty in me
Shit it's hard to feel that pain with all this Henny in me
I miss the way it was just me and the homies
But nowadays everything's different I can't help but feel lonely
I'll never forget those memories or things that you showed me
Cause the day before you passed you told me

[Hook]
See what they tell you it don't mean nothing homie
Long as you know I believe in you homie
Cause we all got weaknesses homie
Don't let them stop you from dreamin' it homie
And what they tell you it don't mean nothing homie
Long as you know I believe in you homie
Cause we all got weaknesses homie
Don't let them stop you from dreamin' it homie
