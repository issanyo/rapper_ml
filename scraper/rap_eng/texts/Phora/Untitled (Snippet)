[Intro]
One, two
This just way too much right now

[Verse 1]
Look
All this pressure on my mind weighing down on my back
All this emptiness inside, I feel my heart turning black
Feel it all turning cold, I'm just losing my soul
And I tried talking to God, but He ain't talk to me back (fuck)
I can't lie and say I never think of you
I can't lie and say I never wish that I could speak to you
I did everything for you
I guess you just couldn't see
I just wish you needed me the same way that I needed you
But my heart just doesn't work like before
Lately I've been so detached, but I'm still searching for more
I lost so many fuckin' people it don't hurt me no more
Because no matter who it is it's never worse than before
But tell me why we never listen when they say that love is dangerous
We try too hard for those that wouldn't do the same for us
We, move so fast and we, hope that it lasts
Give people a place in our hearts and they just end up replacing us
But all my life, I've apologised for who I am, for
Not being a person that these people understand
And I...
