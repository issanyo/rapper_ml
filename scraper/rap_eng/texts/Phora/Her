[Chorus]
All I see is you babe, you, yeah
All I see is you babe, you, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Lately all this pressure getting to me
I feel like I'm losing touch with you
Scared to lose you, I'm scared of breaking my trust with you
But I know you still try for me
I know that you ride for me
Whether I'm in a Bentley or on the bus with you
Just try to understand you everything I prayed for
Came for your smile but your heart is what I stay for
And even though we fall apart sometimes
We shouldn't be so afraid to show our heart sometimes
I mean, usually I ain't good with emotions
Lately, I feel like I'm losing focus
Lately, I feel like our love is broken
And I'm doing all I can just to fix it, I hope you notice

[Pre-Chorus]
But no matter where we at in our lives, just know I wait for you
My biggest fear is drifting away from you
Just know I never plan on letting you go
So right here is where I'm letting you know
All I see is you

[Chorus]
All I see is you babe, you, yeah
All I see is you babe, you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, you tellin' me I'm changin' for the worse
And I just don't know how to act now
Hate it when we argue 'cause I don't know how to back down
Starin' at me, lost like you tryna read my expression
But I love you and that's real, it's just hard for me to express it
But listen, I'm tired of fightin', I'd rather plan out some goals with you
I'd rather grow old with you and share my soul with you
And move away from the city and build a home with you
Do anything I could do just to be alone with you
You know I'm all about you, I write these songs about you
And if I could, I'd take the sun, make it revolve around you
But I guess it doesn't work that way
Sometimes we give all we have and we get hurt that way

[Pre-Chorus]
But no matter where we at in our lives, just know I wait for you
My biggest fear is drifting away from you
Just know I never plan on letting you go
So right here is where I'm letting you know
All I see is you

[Chorus]
All I see is you babe, you, yeah
All I see is you babe, you, yeah

[Outro]
All I see is you babe
