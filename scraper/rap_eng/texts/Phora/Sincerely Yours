[Intro]
Yeah, well...
Nas got me on some shit on this one right here man...
Yours Truly

[Verse 1]
These are confessions of a sinner
I packed my bag and left a letter
Cause my temper seems to get to me sometimes
I get sick of me sometimes
It's pressure from myself is my biggest enemy sometimes
But I hated myself cause of you but I'm done with that
That's why I'm hopping on this train and never coming back
And I refuse to let anyone in my way
I ain't trying to leave you behind but I just can't stay

[Hook]
Yeah I just can't stay (Stay)
Said I just can't stay
So will I keep running away?
Keep running away
Keep running, Keep running...

[Verse 2]
I hope you get to read my letter, I signed it Sincerely Yours
You've been hurt too many times I see them tears of yours
Running down your face like Yosemite falls
But if you ever need something just don't get me involved
Cause I, I got to move on with my life and we all got a choice
We all can speak but not all of us got a voice
So I devote mine to the children of today
But how am I supposed to move on when you keep begging me to stay
Well we must have lost the passion
See my mother used to love you I don't know what happened
Probably cause you changed and she don't like the way you come off for
I guess the connection must have cut off
Like an unpaid build of orison over the hill and horizon
The sun is setting I can feel it inside me that I ain't got no where else to go
But I keep on pushing don't want to leave but I ain't felt this low so I can't stay

[Hook]
Yeah I just can't stay (Stay)
Said I just can't stay
So will I keep running away?
Keep running away
Keep running, Keep running...

[Verse 3]
See I missed the way we used to be
I missed the way you touched my heart used to be true to me
But now you let these niggas walk all over you
They don't treat your name with respect and they talk right over you
Kills me everytime I hear it
Slowly losing my spirit
They sabotaging your beauty they descerate your appearance
And they say I'm scared that's what I'm running away
I guess they right cause we all know what just might happen to me if I stay
I want to leave but I'm lost without you
And I can't stand the way these motherfuckers talk about you
They say you just care for the money and jewels
The cars, the clothes, the fame and the popular dudes
Glamorization the money and living in glory
It just seems like you forgot about the kids with a story
But without you I wouldn't survive one more day
You saved my life dear Hip Hop I'll never leave I'm here to stay
