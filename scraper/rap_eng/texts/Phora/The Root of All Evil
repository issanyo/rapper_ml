[Verse 1: Phora]
Homie, I done seen death and came back
So what the fuck you think I'm 'fraid of?
Diss loyal niggas, I see what they made of
And I don't trust a soul but the family
Cause I heard too many people say they love me when it ain't love
They ain't nothing, but snakes in the grass
Me, I never trust a cute face and an ass
Cause all these bitches simple, I can see it in they face
How many of these snakes will turn fake for the cash
But careful what you wish for and the karma you creating
Cause money ain't nothing when your life get taken
Ain't nobody bulletproof, the number one mistake
That these muhfuckers make is thinking they ain't got replacements
I bet they give up they self respect for the wealth
Don't believe me homie? Check for yourself
Cause what makes you think they got respect for you
When these niggas ain't even got respect for they selves?

[Hook: Phora]
I put my mama in a house before I'm in a Benz
I'll die twice and come back before I get new friends
Nigga, and I'll take my spot back on the couch
Before I'll ever be a slave to the dollar amount
I put my mama in a house before I'm in a Benz
I'll die twice and come back before I get new friends
Look, and I'll take my spot back on the couch
Cause I'll never be a slave to the money I count, nigga

I got 'em saying where the fuck you at?
Front to the back
I got 'em saying where the fuck you at? Where you at?
Front to the back
Like where the fuck you at, where the fuck you headed nigga?
Nah, I don't think you get it nigga
Give a fuck about the money in our bank accounts
Cause it ain't nothing if we dead my nigga

[Verse 2: Phora]
I seen hell, I seen niggas slang they mama dope
I seen niggas fiend for a line of coke
Money make a thirsty chick hop up out her jeans
Do things you only see in your dreams if you got the dough
Yeah, it got these niggas acting strange
They chasing the dollars, they ain't after change
Nah, me and them will never be alike, we'll never be the same
Now I'll never forget where my family came nigga
Y'all ain't got no chain
Heard if you ain't balling, you ain't got no name
Fuck the money, cause I'd rather go out like Cobain
With a bullet through my temple, now I got no brains
Like fuck 'em and fuck the world, you can have it dawg
Y'all ain't no better, I ain't mad at y'all
Cause I'd rather be buried in my grave than live life like a slave
Fuck the money, you can have it all
