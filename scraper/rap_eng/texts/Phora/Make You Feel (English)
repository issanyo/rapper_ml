Once you  with me, I guarantee you there is nothing better
I mean, our bond is unbreakable together
No matter what happens, no matter what  weather
Every night after work, I'm the one who you coming  to see
You can not get rid of me, I'm like a fucking disease
I mean, it's like heaven huh? fucking with me
But everything comes with a cost girl, nothings for free
You can't live without me, you feel the numbness in your body
I love it when I'm with you with the functions and the parties
When all alone, and we know you will never letting go of me
And even if you have kids without me, they gone grow with me
There's always going to be part of me inside you
That's why you always craw back
Even when it fights you
Ill die for you girl, I know you do the same
You fell in love with me before you even knew my name
And being with me hurts but you use the pain
Yeah I know you feel the rush going through your veins
So she laid back, took a deep breathe and put the heroin inside here until there was nothing left
She just....

Until your close enough to taste it
