[Hook]
You got two faces to you, I hate being around you
Hate the fact that I need you, but I'm glad that I found you
Cause you know I can't live without you
Nah, I can't live without you
And yesterday I heard a friend of mine talking about you

[Verse 1]
Saying he needs you more than I do
Man, fuck that nigga
I always knew he was a punk, I couldn't trust that nigga
Plus that nigga, just don't deserve you
Late nights I was chasing you, breaking mama's curfew
See, back then I was foolish thinking you'd give me a chance
But, honestly I was naive and patience is a virtue
Know I spend so much time with you, but I never met you
When you come around, I see people's true intentions
I see the way they look at you, trying to get your attention
And the way they fight over you, that shit ruins friendships
But you don't care, do you?
They wish they had you, see the look in their eyes?
They jealous of me, I have you, now they want me to die
You see, the problem is no matter how much I'm with you I'm still lonely
Plus I feel like you're the reason I lost my real homies
But let's face it, no one else can replace you
All the times I kept you safe, you should be telling me
"Thank you"
I refuse to spend all my time in this world trying to chase you
Chasing this dream I have is more important
I can still taste you
I can still feel you to the touch
Well, I guess I spend too much time on you
I put my life and my family all to the side for you
See, you know that I need you, but I won't die for you
And truth is, I hate you cause there's two sides to you

[Hook]
You got two faces to you, I hate being around you
Hate the fact that I need you, but I'm glad that I found you
Cause you know I can't live without you
Nah, I can't live without you
And yesterday I heard a friend of mine talking about you

[Verse 2]
Saying he wants you so bad that he'll do anything to get you
So he keep his magazine loaded like it's no issue
I miss you, but ever since I had you, I ain't been the same me
I hate to admit it, but you changed me
Yeah, for better or worse? Shit, I probably couldn't tell you
But honestly if you left me, I'd probably be a failure
Or at least that's what they'll think about me
See, I know myself and I know I'm good without you
All these people, they just speak about me
Talking out they asses saying my name
Telling me, since I've been with you, I ain't been the same
But shit, I'm taking care of my mama
Making sure that she's happy
Got her a brand new mattress and put food in the pantry
Show these people that I'm everything that they said I can't be
So if they hate me for needing you, they don't understand me
Yeah, so how could I disrespect you?
Even though you no good for me, I could never neglect you
Even through hard times, you was always there when the rent due
I don't know if it was God himself or the Devil who sent you
But before you came along
I was the one they doubted, laughed at and hated on
Now all of a sudden they not mean cause of you
People talk to me, people treat me like a king cause of you
But back when I didn't have you, I wasn't shit
Now everyone know you with me, they love me, go suck a dick
You see, I fucking hate you cause you ripped my fucking family apart
I lost friends cause of you, how can you have a heart?
You don't have a heart, you don't have feelings for shit
No, you don't care what people go through
You don't care if they sick
You don't care if they die, what you do is sick to me
Everyone looks at you like you ruled the world
But you don't mean shit to me
You got two sides, you got two faces
Now you wondering who's this person and all these places
But this person's not human, this person can't feel
It's the almighty dollar that we all been chasing
Two faces
