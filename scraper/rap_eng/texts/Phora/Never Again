[Verse]
Kiss the the tattoos on my neck
Whisper in my ear
Tell me all the things I wanna hear
The scent of your perfume is strong
But apparently not enough
Cux the smell is over powered by your fear
Ill never know your lying if I never find out
Is funny that the games you played never come with time outs
I used to wait for you to call while you were out having your fun
I believed you when you said I was the one
But go and lick your lips baby
Yeahhh tell me if you taste me
Gonna hit that blunt to keep
Yourself from going crazy
Drown your pain in the bottle
Cux you can't deal with your problems
And is all good till you hit the bottom
Ever since you left this loneliness
Is kept me company girls do never fuck with me
Cux they ain't got no trust in me
I can't tell you think I'm lying
Every time I'm being honest
Despite my broken promises I think
We can we resolve this
Your confused I can see it on your face
Hate to see such a beautiful thing
Go to waist so your out their every night
Trying to run from your mistakes and you back sniffing that white cause that's your way to escape cux that's the way to scape
You try to hide your pain but
I know it when I see it and all I ever
I wannat to do is hold you it and re-leave it
Kiss you and say "I'm here for you"
Now Im just dropping tears for you
Cux everything you do is taking effect on your spiritual
Misery like company so please come and spend the night with me
I wanna talk, you rather fight with me
It was your decision to leave me
Now your with the nigga that you want
But yet you need me you know its true
Why do you push yourself away
When you get closer to trust issues
Laying deeps in your thoughts
Never trust a nigga that's the way you were taught
Cux your momma left your daddy when he cheated on her
She was never able to tell you why he beat his daughter
So you grew up with a chip on your shoulder and the thrust for revenge
Telling yourself no man will ever hurt you again
Telling yourself no man will ever hurt you again

[Chorus]
Chip on your shoulder and the thrust for revenge
Telling yourself no man will ever hurt you again
Telling yourself no man will ever hurt you again
Telling yourself no man will ever hurt you again

[Outro]
Right, Right Right Right
