[Verse 1]
Yeah
I wish I could just be honest
Wish I didn't have to lie, just wish I would've kept that promise
When I'm starin' at the mirror, I just don't see myself inside it
Wish I could go back in time, get through high school, and go to college, but I just can't now
And I could never turn around, I let my fam down
It's funny everybody sayin', "You the man, now"
But no matter what size of these bank withdrawals
It'll never take away the pain I caused, 'cause yeah, I've been unfaithful, God
At times I've been ungrateful, God, and
At my lowest points, I went as far sayin', "I hate you, God"
And nothin' is okay right now
No one feels my pain right now
If I didn't have my team, I would've blew out my fuckin' brains by now
But I'm just hopin', yeah
But I'm just hopin'
Yeah, I'm just hopin'

[Hook]
Yeah, I've been unfaithful, God
At times I've been ungrateful, God, and
At my lowest points, I went as far sayin', "I hate you, God"
And nothin' is okay right now
No one feels my pain right now
If I didn't have my team, I would've blew out my fuckin' brains by now
But I'm just hopin', yeah
I'm just hopin'
I'm just hopin' someone cares
Yeah, I'm just hopin' someone's there
Yeah, I've been ungrateful, God
Yeah, I've been unfaithful, God

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm a liar
I'm a cheater
I'm a sinner
I'm on fire
And I drink 'til my blood gets thinner
I'm an—addict
I'm a loser
I'm a quitter
And I take what isn't mine, so how you figure—
Anyone would love me? I can't even love myself
So many broken hearts, but I couldn't tell you one I've felt
I guess I'm just numb to the pain
And everytime someone gets close to my heart, I just end up runnin' away (away, 'way, 'way)

[Outro]
I guess I'm just numb to the pain
I guess I'm just numb to the pain
'Cause I just end up runnin' away
Yeah, I guess I'm just numb to the pain
