I said I'm about to take this back to 09' bombin' train yards never black bookin'
Like I was on my skateboard gotta keep it pushin' now these cats are steady looking
Cuz they ain't never heard a rapper from the westcoast spit like this before
Now they tryna jack my style so they switch they flow
But I'm too smooth for these cats and they too typical ay yo
But I ain't hatin' homie get cha paper but just don't walk around my city like you can relate
Cuz you don't come from where we come from I'm just talkin' that real dollar menu was my dinner never no home cooked meals
So what's the deal? Rappers braggin' bout riches sayin' they better then only makes me remember back to the shit I never had
No money in my pockets still I kept a smile wasn't rockin' the lastest shoes had my own style
And mean while they stuck in frogelent fantisies while I was out chasin' my dreams now they mad at me

(Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...)
Keep it pushin'
(Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...)
I gotta keep it pushin' now these cats is steady lookin'

Hate it or love it the underdogs on top and Ima shine even after my fuckin' heart stops
And I guarantee you everything I told you I was the truth and the ones who doubt me have never been around me I can teach you
How to read a mutha fuckas face until he's see through and make a mans confidence drop to the ground when he sees you
The difference between you and I, you can live without it, me I either do it or die to tell you the truth you a lie
And your whole fuckin' image is so decieving I'm the future and you the only nigga who don't believe it
I can break your words to pieces and say clean up the mess but I ain't with that, cause the best revenge is success
So take it how you want mutha fucka it ain't a diss all I'm tryna say is that jealousy is a bitch
I try to keep it cool but there's only so much a nigga could take and tryna play me was your biggest mistake

(Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...)
Keep it pushin'
(Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...)
I gotta keep it pushin' now these cats is steady lookin'
