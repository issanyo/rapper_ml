[Verse 1: Phora & Vicktor Taiwò]
Yeah
See it's been hard for me to be myself
I look in the mirror and I can't see myself
Feel like I'm screaming and no one's hearing me
Trapped in my insecurities knowing I couldn't free myself (I see you)
My heart and my time are two things I stopped giving
'Cause most of us are breathing but we not living
What happens then when I'm too numb inside to even feel
What happens when there's no more life in me for you to kill (I see you)
I can't love now
I can't trust now
I can't help but drinking to feel the rush now
I can't lose you
I can't keep you
I can't stay but you know I'm too weak to leave you (I see you)
Know I'm too weak to love someone else 'cause you know I need you
Even though you lie to me I still try to believe you
But we ended up as the type of people that don't love
'Cause we grew up in a world that just never showed love (I see you)
But if you see me now you wouldn't recognize me
All these feelings that I used to have are dead inside me
And I don't know how much longer I can stay
The ones that hold close are the ones that just push away (I see you)
And it's like, having trouble finding myself
I couldn't say I'm still the same I couldn't lie to myself
They say love has a price we just can't afford what it cost
Looking for ourselves in a place where we're all lost

[Chorus: Vicktor Taiwò]
I see you running into the woods
With your bright yellow jacket
You look lost
Yeah, you look lost
I see you running into the woods
With your bright yellow jacket
You look lost
Yeah, you look lost
I see you

[Verse 2: Phora & Vicktor Taiwò]
Yeah, my family don't know the shit I've been going through
I'm empty now and it's been a while since I've spoke to you
I run to you because I know your soul has been broken too
But maybe that's the reason why I just couldn't get close to you (I see you)
You're no good, your love is dressed in destruction
I pushed away but without you I couldn't function
I needed something to feel, I just needed something that's real
'Cause I just keep numbing the pain 'til I feel nothing in these (I see you)
Nightmares haunt me still but I just keep dreaming
If God exists tell me why I only see demons?
Yeah I only see demons
Trying not to choke and my lungs fill with smoke like how the fuck I keep breathing? (I see you)
We live in a time where love is more painful than hate now
So all the smiles we  give to people are fake now
And we just hide how we feel so we never break down
And all these doubts got me feeling like a mistake now (I see you)
I wish I didn't have to take these pills
But I just needed something that can make me feel
I just needed something that could take what's real
And make me numb 'cause all this pain just can't be killed (I see you)
I can't be killed, my soul's too real that's when it broke to pieces
Who would have thought that loving you was my only weakness?
Fuck, who would have thought that loving you was my only weakness?

[Chorus: Vicktor Taiwò]
I see you running into the woods
With your bright yellow jacket
You look lost
Yeah, you look lost
I see you running into the woods
With your bright yellow jacket
You look lost
Yeah, you look lost
I see you
