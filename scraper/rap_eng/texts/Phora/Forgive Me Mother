When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?

[Verse 1]
He had the heart of a soldier in a city full of bandits
Ran with the cold spirits, couple of bad habits
Heart full of pain and a pipe full of magic
Getting him high, he's feeling like he's ready to die
But his girl just told him she pregnant, he don't know what to do
The word "Father" was just something that he never knew
So hows he gonna be one
Hows he gonna raise child in a city full of demons
When his mother had three sons
And two of em' dead, one took two to the head
The other took three to the heart, he never knew what was said
But he knows, he's all his mother got now
He ain't got no feelings, they say he's numb to the pain
He on the corner with the Glock now
Momma always told him he was God's son
But he's feeling like the Devils advocate
Running streets with the lost ones
And he don't wanna lose touch with his soul
But he's feeling like he ain't got nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Verse 2]
He wanted to be like Nas, Biggie and Pac
He used to bump em' in his uncles whip until he got shot
The first time he ever saw tears coming from his mother's eyes
Too young to understand, so he just wondered why
He always used to ask the Lord if heaven had a ghetto
And when he tries to end it all, he just can't seem to let go
He shed so many tears, so many times, so many lies
All he feels in his heart is hate, so he never cries
He's running with the pack like a wild coyote
Running the city sticking nigga's up like "Pay what you owe me"
It's just him against the world, all his homeboys turned on him
They plotting to get him, they asking "What's the word on him?"
They heard his mother stayed a few blocks down
Hopped in the ride, got to the house and let off some rounds
Twenty-five shots through the window, ten through the door
Opened his eyes and he seen his mother dead on the floor
Mother forgive me
