[Verse 1: Phora]
Its that type of joint that you burn put in your system and roll to
I ain't got to spark a blunt I'm keeping it old school
Just me and my music and my 03 Camry
It ain't much but if it gets me to my girl shit I'll be happy
Rolling through my city passing streets I used to walk through
Memories of school and all the girls I used to talk to
Flashbacks to the time when I drank my first Mickey's
Paint stains on my dickies, Freight trains on a quickie
Graf writers know what the fuck I'm talking about
Member the very first time you got socked in the mouth? I do
Every week I used to get my ass beat
All the times I ran from the cops could've been an athlete
I ain't tryna have cuffs on my wrists in the backseat
So I'm running through your backyard like it's a track meet
See, I ain't a criminal, just a youngster with problems
And I don't show up to school cause the teachers say not to bother
Prolly cause they lost hope in our generation.
All I needed was some guidance and some elevation.
But they ain't have it so I tried to act cool and hung with the wrong crowd
Never follow the rules so I bump this song loud
So selfish I never thought I'd make mom proud, now she taking pictures from the crowd she need to calm down
Tagging me on Facebook every four minutes
Never made a song without putting my soul in it
And this is only getting started
This is for my dearly departed, we out here living homie

[Hook]
I miss the way it was, reminiscing bout the old days
Miss the good times, back when everything was okay
Cause we had no worries, no cares
But nothing is the same, life just ain't fair
Cause we had no worries, no cares
But nothing is the same, life just ain't fair

[Verse 2]
So rest in peace to the peeps I'll never see again
I been seeing grandpa in moods that I've never seen him in
85 years old, still keeping it moving with a smile on his face saying "There's still room for improvement"
He ain't got a big house, and he's still pushing a bucket.
But he taught me how to love life even when I had nothing
I rock my dirty Chuck's like they were Jordan's made of gold.
I keep my head to the sky and I never look below
Sip my fourty with a passion, this is for all my people
I promised to keep you living till the day I'm in a casket
Life ain't what it was, and its so hard to get used to
Blues Clues and Coco Puffs, before there was a YouTube
Used to, love to walk to school in the rain
Railroads, watching trains pass envision my name on every one of them
All my 90's kids know where I'm coming from
Rugrats on Saturday mornings right when the sun is up
Raised in Southern Cali, got that California mind state
So don't blame me if I cut you off in traffic
I used to tell girls I'm a rapper over MySpace
Even before I started rapping
Yeah homie, I miss them old days
Miss cruising through Anaheim with pops bumping the o'jays
So all my real niggas put your glass up
You never know if it's your last one
This is for the old days
