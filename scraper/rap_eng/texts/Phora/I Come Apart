[Verse 1]
Yeah, losin' my faith, losin' my mind
Losin' my friends, just hopin' I find
Something to feel, something that's real
'Cause all that we know is narcotics and pills
My pops got a case, thirty stacks for the bail
Lookin' back at my words like, "Where the fuck did I fail?"
Look to God for the answers, I just hope for a sign
I'm just prayin' for peace, as I load up my 9

[Hook]
See, I come apart sometimes, I'm not me
I come apart sometimes
I'm missin' my heart sometimes, I can't sleep, yeah
I come apart sometimes
Yeah, I come apart sometimes, yeah
I come apart sometimes
Yeah, I'm missin' my heart sometimes
Yeah, I come apart sometimes

[Post-Hook]
They start breakin' me down
Got me chained to the ground
I can't take it no more, if I stay, then I drown
Can't let it get to me
I let it get to me

[Verse 2]
This anxiety kills, it'll eat you alive
I'm just blind to my problems, I can't see what I hide
Traumatized by the world,but I can't let it kill me
I took a bullet to my head, but they say that they feel me
The land of the free, where they put us in chains
Where they lock us in cages, new millenium slaves
Look to God for the answers, I just hope for a sign
I'm just prayin' for peace, as I load up my 9

[Hook]
See, I come apart sometimes, I'm not me
I come apart sometimes
I'm missin' my heart sometimes, I can't sleep, yeah
I come apart sometimes
Yeah, I come apart sometimes, yeah
I come apart sometimes
Yeah, I'm missin' my heart sometimes
Yeah, I come apart sometimes

[Post-Hook]
They start breakin' me down
Got me chained to the ground
I can't take it no more, if I stay, then I drown
Can't let it get to me
I let it get to me
