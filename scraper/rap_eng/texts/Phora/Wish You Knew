My eyes are only for you
See, I just wish that you knew
After all that we've been through
I just wish you knew

[Verse 1: Phora]
She never had a thing for the diamond rings, clothes, and designer jeans
The thing that she truly wanted in life was a guy to see
The woman that she truly was and understand the pain
Can't really love the sun if you've never been through the rain All she really wanted was somebody to care
Giving all you're love to a person but they're not really there That can take a toll on you and make you feel like you're worthless
Nobody sees down inside all they really see is the surface
But beneath that pretty smile that she had when she spoke Was a quiet pain and darkness from her heart that was broke Sometimes she gets lost, lost in the memories like a dream When all of it was so perfect and nothing came in between
The love they showed each other for years
But as time passed on all those smiles eventually turned to tears
She said "all I feel now is this emptiness that's inside of me, they always tell me to be strong and I try to be, but"

My eyes are only for you
See, I just wish that you knew
After all that we've been through
I just wish you knew

[Verse 2: Phora]
She said.. "Feels like the very day you left me when's my heart stopped beating and nonstop breathing
I know I wasn't perfect but I got my reasons and you got yours Just wish I had more
More time to just make this right before you walked out the door
Know we had our ups and downs but I'll never love no one after you
I'll never move on but I'ma do what I have to do
You were the world, you were my first and my only
My eyes are only for you I just wish you would show me
Show me your heart, show me your love, show me you care, Tell me its fine, tell me you're here, say you ain't scared
Cause if I only had one wish, I wish we could just talk
About the things we love in life
Instead we just screamed and we fought
Should've never let you leave
We said these things that we probably didn't mean
I dream of going back and making you stop
Took each other for granted, I'll forever regret it
But one day I get to see you in heaven

[Hook: Wolvang]
My eyes are only for you
See, I just wish that you knew
After all that we've been through
I just wish you knew
