[Hook x2]
They say they hate the new me
But I'mma do me
Cuz I ain't got time to be focused on you
Never took a handout, did this shit my damn self
I've been working hard and you should too
They say they hate the new me
But I'mma do me
Cuz I ain't got time to be focused on you
Never took a handout, did this shit my damn self
I've been working hard and you should too

[Verse 1]
All my old friends told me that I've change
All of these new kids around me for the fame
But time will tell between real or fake and I'll have to see
Cuz yo the only katt that always had my back was me
And sometimes it's even hard to trust my damn self
All these people wanna do me favors but they can't help
Can't find the solution if you don't know what the problem is
Guess that's why I really never cave into no politics
Many say they love me but very few mean it
I would say I love 'em too but I don't know the meaning
I try to understand but I don't get the concept
Guess I'm still a kid that just don't know what he wants yet
Many say they love me but very few mean it
I would say I love 'em too but I don't know the meaning
I try to understand but I don't get the concept
Guess I'm still a kid that just don't know what he wants yet

[Verse 2]
I never blamed another person for any mistake I ever made
I take the lost I learn from it and hope for better days
Y'all go through up's and down's I'm aiming for heavens gate
And I ain't playing playa I know the game I ain't getting played
Unless it's on Rapies and Rhymes and I ain't with that bullshit so homie save me the time
I'll handle my own don't do me no favors, I'm fine
I heard you want to catch me slippin' homie wait in the line
Cats is talking hard over twitter y'all playin' hide and seek
Always got my name in yo mouth but that's what i like to see
Yeah I hear 'em saying Phora this and Phora that
But it's gonna take more then a knife and some words to hold me back
Never carry strap that ain't the way I roll brah
I 'ont live in fear but I still look over my shoulder
Paranoia is one hell of a cloud to live with
It's with you everywhere you go there's no way out this shit
But honestly that's not why I'm never around to kick it
I'd just rather make some money and get down to business
And I doubt that you'll listen to me if I tried to explain
I do this shit for y'all not for the fame
