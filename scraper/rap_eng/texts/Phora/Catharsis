[Verse 1]
Ay yo this life is like a dream I just hope that I never wake
Made mistakes in the past but I'm trying to set it straight
Been through hell and back
Hope they accept at heavens gates
Sell my soul for a mill that's a deal that I'll never take
And I'll never break under pressure
I realized how fortunate my life has been
So I'm always giving back to the lesser
I'm blessed but, the devil's been following on my foot steps Surprised my life ain't been took yet misunderstood? Yes!
Ask me to explain, there's not enough time to show you all the Thoughts that I got locked in my mind
Listen my heart is as solid as Optimus Prime
And my voice is almost as painful as Pac's in his Prime
And the day I pass away is when the stars will align
And the planets collide I see the light screamin', god
Save my life from the violence I'm just fighting the odds
Like a lion yo I fight for my pride
That's my people not my ego like a eagle visions Far as the skies
Like a eagle visions far as the skies
And they tell me that's the limit
But folks already made it to the moon
So I'll never stop reachin' till the day I'm in my tomb
And when you at my funeral, dressed in all white
Pour some liquor out for me smoke session all night
Cause it's only right I'll be happy to see the light
No need to mourn my death just celebrate my life, look

[Second Verse: Phora]
I'm having trouble catching my breath
Having trouble seeing clearly I've been laughing at death Surrounded by the wolves, snakes and the vulture's waiting to hold ya
We dying out and there's no hope in saving the culture
But, before it's over it's all gonna' hit you
Cause you're just sitting on your ass instead of solving your issues
All these niggas want your neck and yeah they all gonna' get you
We gon' see how far that motherfuckin' talking will get you Homie I had to learn the hard way
Almost lost my life walking down Euclid St. and Broadway Wrong time wrong place
Just thanking God one of them bullets didn't touch me
But, I had a couple friends in my life that ain't get so lucky Cause 7 month later, R2 from S.T.L got stuck outside of school And he died at the age of 12
Usually I don't wish pain on a person
But I hope the motherfucker who did it rots in a fucking cell
12 years with so many more to go
Why'd they have to do it we probably won't ever know
It's a never ending cycle
Been trying not to lose my faith, grippin' on a bible
It's like death is right behind you
But you keep movin' forward you trying to get away
But it just, keeps getting closer but you fight another day
Never give up see that's the meaning of life
And even when you're down there's always a reason to fight
I said never give up that's the meaning of life
And even when you're down there's always a reason to fight And even when you in the darkness yo just think of the light And just make sure they know my name if I stop breathing tonight
YOURS TRULY!
