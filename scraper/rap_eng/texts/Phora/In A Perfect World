[Intro]
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect
Ain't nobody perfect

[Verse]
See, in a perfect world it would all be so simple
Sometimes simple isn't worth it
Cause all the hard times I've been through
Made me the man I am today
And I ain't nowhere close to perfect
But I'm perfectly fine with that, I'm still breathing
So many scars and wounds that'll never heal
I'm still bleeding, I know you see 'em
All those imperfections in yourself
You're just stressing it too much, but life's a lesson in itself
One day we'll learn what it means
One day we'll learn to be free
Lately I've been trying to separate my wants and my needs
But what does perfect mean? lately I've been asking myself
If I paint you this picture maybe you'll answer yourself
You see, a perfect world to me is no more violence
No more gunshots at night, homie and no more sirens
No more kids losing their life too soon and no drunk driving
I seen it happen way too many times and we ain't trying
We ain't trying hard enough to change it
Broken hearts and hatred
A perfect world to me is a world free of this racists
So who are you to judge a person by the color of skin
How hard is it just to smile and treat each other as kin
I wish, there was a world where our children could play outside
Without a drive-by occurring and watching stray bullets fly
But why, why does it feel like we're not ready?
When I talk about change, man
Why I feel like they don't get me?
Well, I guess I ain't perfect enough
One day the money and jewels gon' be worthless to us
We gonna value ourselves based of the love in our hearts
Not the cash in our pockets
I'm thinking what if we start a perfect world
Where the music ain't downgrading our women
And they stop degrading themselves
They lost faith in our women
Trust me, I'm not one to judge
Can't stand the way that I'm livin'
We all dream of that perfect place and man
I'm way beyond vision
See, I can hear it, taste it and feel it
The scent of it is so potent
Perfect like your first love before your heart was broken
Perfect like the sound of crashing waves in the ocean
It's perfect like the sound of music when you play it while smoking
So many, perfect imperfections in this world, still I love it here
Only 21 and I hope to make it another year
But if not, my soul will be perfectly free
She might not be perfect to you, but man she's perfect to me
Yours Truly

[Chorus: Unknown]
Ain't nobody perfect
But we're all worth this life
Don't matter where we're going
As long as we're living right
Ain't nobody perfect
But we're all worth this life
Don't matter where we're going
As long as we're living right
We only got this one time, one time
For a limited time
We only got this one time, one time
For a limited time
We only got this one time, one time
For a limited time
We only got this one time, one time
For a limited time
Ain't nobody perfect

[Outro: Phora]
You see, at the very end of it
I didn't know where I was
All I know it was peaceful
Almost like a place nothing could go wrong
A place so perfect
I've always imagined a place like this
Ever since I was young, I was
Never really able to sleep
My mom always told me:
"Close your eyes, picture the waves crashing
Imagine yourself there with no worries"
That's the only thing that ever really helps
So much going on in this world
Sometimes I wonder if we were able to think our
Own heaven into existence
What would mine be like?
Well, I think I finally found it
Better yet, I think it's been with me all along
