[Verse 1]
Look homie I got that Cali state of mind, man, I never been a chump
I always had skill, y'all just got beginner's luck
My nigga's up in the valley, know how we do it, we rowdy
I walk up in the place and these niggas know I'm from Cali
You can tell by the way I talk and how my chucks laced up
Niggas lookin mad like the they tryina shoot the place up
But y'all gots to chill with that drama, for real, cause I ain't tryin to see somebody get killed
But like Devon said, there's always that one in the crowd talkin loud, and jealousy and envy got em runnin they mouth
Got one too many drinks in they system, they over did it
So if you sip on a nigga make sure that you know your limit
And we could cruise down the Five on them August nights, warm summer breeze, drivin through them city lights
Gotta watch my back cause I hear some niggas after me
Yo, but ain't no other place I'd rather be, I'm rollin with my
Windows down, breeze across my face
Nothing too fancy, man, it's not really my taste
But I'm always on the grind, twenty-four seven, man, and I ain't got the time for no bullshit, please don't bring it this way
Never had a problem with a nigga tryin to get paid
Cause we all gotta eat, but if you with the drama, get the fuck up off of me now
I said I'm on the plane to LAX comin from Reno, auntie told me to stay away from prostitutes and casinos
Once you fall into an addiction, it's hard to quit
And when you quit you lose everything that you started with
I spark then spit the truth and pass the joint, I get straight to the point
Yo, I'd die for this shit cause I ain't got no other choice
I'm asleep in the foray, I'm catchin narcolepsy
Hopped up on the train just to see how far it gets me
Job won't let me come through the front door so I break through the back
Ain't nobody real as us and I'm just statin a fact
Lacin these tracks up, like a pair of new shoes
Sippin on a Blue Moon, you know my steez, rest in peace Guru
Shine like the sun before it sets in the west
Left side but I'm reppin, check the ink in my flesh
But the gangs that rock Taylors never heard of Khalifa
But they rep the California, steady burnin up refer like
Windows down, breeze across my face
Nothing too fancy, man, it's not really my taste
But I'm always on the grind, twenty-four seven, man, and I ain't got the time for no bullshit, please don't bring it this way
Never had a problem with a nigga tryin to get paid
Cause we all gotta eat, but if you with the drama, get the fuck up off of me now
