[Intro: Phora]
Trynna' make you feel it
Trynna' make you feel it

[Verse 1: Phora]
Yo, I make music for the lost souls
The ones who never had a chance to shine
The ones that wished they had a place to call home
Wonder where I'll be in 7 years, only god knows
Eventually one day we all go hope for tomorrow
And pray for the day, lord forgive me for my past ways
Make the best of life you never know when it's your last day
Alive and well I'm so lucky to be
But I always get the feeling someone's coming for me
Sometimes it really gets to me
But last time I seen a cat that was truly in peace he was covered in sheets, uh
So many lost souls running the streets
But I just hope that they learn something from me
I'm just trynna pass some knowledge to my young folk
All I smell in this city is liquor, beef, and gunsmoke
Homie I'm in the front row
Bird's eye view yeah I see it so clearly
Trynna talk to god but sometimes he don't hear me
My heart is so weary always wonder why they lie to me
Social outcast never fit in with society
Yo, and you could take the money and clothes
But you can never take the love in my soul, motherfuckers

[Hook: Phora]
This is for the lost souls, trynna find where they belong
This is for the peeps trynna do right before they gone
Put your fists up spark your lighter to this song
Cause I ain't trynna make a million
I'm just trynna make you feel it
This is for the lost souls, trynna find where they belong
This is for the peeps trynna do right before they gone
Put your fists up spark your lighter to this song
Cause I ain't trynna make a million
I'm just trynna make you feel it

[Verse 2: Phora]
Yeah, I complained about having no shoes
Until I seen a man with no feet
I got my game from the man on the corner singing the blues in the city where niggas don't sleep
And they're quick to take what you got
But only if you show your weak side
And nothing comes for free
Everything got a cost life's a trip there ain't no free rides
Either you a victim or a suspect
Every time I try to talk they tell me drop the subject
What ya'll niggas scared or something?
They said,"You right"
But last time I seen somebody make a change they took his life

[Hook: Phora]
This is for the lost souls, trynna find where they belong
This is for the peeps trynna do right before they gone
Put your fists up spark your lighter to this song
Cause I ain't trynna make a million
I'm just trynna make you feel it
This is for the lost souls, trynna find where they belong
This is for the peeps trynna do right before they gone
Put your fists up spark your lighter to this song
Cause I ain't trynna make a million
I'm just trynna make you feel it

[Outro: Phora]
I'm searching for my soul trynna find my way home
Yeah, trynna find my way home
Searching for my soul trynna find my way home, home
To be all alone, I said
Searching for my soul trynna find my way home
I'm trynna find my way home
Searching for my soul trynna find my way home
Do you know what it's like, to be all alone
Cause I ain't trynna make a million
I'm just trynna make you feel it
