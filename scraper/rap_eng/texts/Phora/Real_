They say my time is coming soon
And they wanna take my life, but that ain't nothing new
I've been spit on, bleeding on the ground
Been kicked on, but if I'm going down motherfucker then you coming to
Lately I just don't know what to do
Cause I hear these nigguhs talking, but they actions never coming through
So stop yapping on the net
I fear no man, but God so come and slice these tats up off my neck
And if ya'll gangsters so tough then I don't know why ya'll don't ever come to none of my shows
Close your mouth
It ain't to hard to catch me
I'm coming in your cites
But you'll probably just look pass me (Ha)
Real shit though I try to keep the peace
But it's difficult to keep when nigguhs always starting beef
Put your ears next to my soul
Tell me if you hear me
These are my last words before these motherfuckers kill me

Haha
Can you feel me? (nope)
No I'm not new to this I'm true to this (I'm true to this nigga)
You ain't really real I can tell when I look at you (I can tell when I look at you)
I'm authentic you artificial man (Artificial man)

Haha
Can you feel me? (Nah)
No I'm not new to this I'm true to this (I'm true to this nigga)
You ain't really real I can tell when I look at you
I'm authentic you artificial man

Nowadays everybody want to be real
Don't want to put in work, but they expect to eat a free meal
Lost faith
Cause this worlds so fake
Had to leave my last chic
Cause these girls is snakes and shit
I lost hope to finding a girl I trust
Cause the last one I was with didn't really give a fuck
Since I ain't got nobody to talk with
These beats become therapy and help deal with the nonsense
And I can't wait to die (Huh)
Cause when I'm gone their gonna realize the reason why I came to life
Paste the skies with love
They let the fake shit rise above
And when I tell you that I'm real
No I ain't saying I'm a thug
And saying I'm a gangster
I'm just true to myself
Cause in the end that's all that matters fuck the girls, fame, and wealth
So try to life my life then tell me if you feel me
These are my last words before these motherfuckers kill me
