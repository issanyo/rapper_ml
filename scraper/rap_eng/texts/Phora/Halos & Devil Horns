[Verse 1: Phora]
Sometimes I feel like I got a halo over my devil horns
Not really knowing was worse or better for it
The world turns and over time I really learn
Never judge someone taking steps in shoes you've never worn
So why would they judge me?
Bet they couldn't walk a couple feet in my chucked T's
It's been rough for me since I ain't even had front teeth
Just a young buck bumping Pac and BIG
While I was saying Super Nintendo Sega Genesis
When I was 15, homie, I couldn't picture this
I was up in the hospital without a chance to live
God had plans for me, it's my chance to give
Back to the fans and the kids and the people tryna do good in life
All my homies pleading guilty, the case is they couldn't fight
Stay strong, be positive, keep yo head up
Instead of finding someone to wet up just keep yo bread up
Don't wrap yo hands around that Beretta, it's all a setup
I'm tryna spread the love, it's nothin' these cats can't tell us
I speak for my generation, watch me open these doors
Nas told me the world was mine, now I'mma show you it's yours
One love!

[Chorus: Notorious BIG - Juicy]
It was all a dream
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all
And if you don't know
And if you don't know now you know, nigga

[Verse 2: Phora]
Yeah, I remember, getting kicked out of my pop's house
Sleepin' in my homie's Honda till I got locked out
And had no where to go tryna make dough to help moms out
Picked up my pen and pad and that's the second I dropped out
See, I done risked it all to follow a dream they said I couldn't reach
Spent the rest of my child hood running' on the streets
Nah it's ironic, they called me up last week
Saying' that teachers having trouble teaching they think
I should give a speech, haha
It's funny how that works, huh?
Funny I believe in God, but not the church, huh?
And it's funny how my demons get a hold of me
I don't need to read the Bible, I just need to write a verse, huh?
I done went through it all
Sippin' 40s, little shawties, taggin' up on the walls
All I really had was a heart of steel and my dirty chughs
Late nights in the city, taggin' like hurry up
We gotta catch the bus down beach boulevard
That was before my cousin started sneakin' out granny's car
Round the same time my heart first broke, that shit changed me
But help me see the difference between a trick and the lady
So watch for these cats that got they eyes on yo steps
They ain't holdin' you down then they just holdin' you back
I'm speakin' for this generation, watch me open these doors
Nas told me the world was mine, now I'mma show you it's yours
One love!

[Chorus: Notorious BIG - Juicy]
It was all a dream
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all
And if you don't know
And if you don't know now you know, nigga

[Outro: Phora]
Yeah, this song was inspired by
The great words of the Notorious BIG, rest in peace
Yeah, 1,2, we still sip 40 ounces
And birthdays was the worst days, we still sip 40 ounces when we thirsty ain't shit changed
I just had to do that one time I just had to
Yeah we still sip 40 ounces when we thirsty ain't shit changed
No nigga ain't shit changed
