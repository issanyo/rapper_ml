[Intro]
All these days I'm thinking of you
You're leaving me behind
I'll put it all behind
Just to be close to you

[Pre-Hook]
Everybody knows you don't feel how I feel about you, girl
Everybody knows you fucked me over and I'm still about you, girl
Everybody knows I was nothing like your last
I should put you in the past
They thought me and you would never last

[Hook]
But we fight then we break up, aye
Then we fuck 'til we make up, yeah
Through the nights that we wake up, aye
It ain't right, nah, it ain't love
But I need you, I need you
We fight then we break up, aye
Then we fuck 'til we make up, yeah
Through the nights that we wake up, aye
It ain't right, nah, it ain't love
But I need you, I need you
Need you, you, you, you, you
Need you
Need you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
So how can you question that?
All this time, shit, I had your back
All these problems you had, I was there for you
Gave all my time to you, I just can't get that back
If I had a chance to go back, I wonder, "Would I redo it?"
That fake smile, yeah, I see through it
I see the pain behind it, your heart's capable of love, I just didn't have the key to it
Should I leave you in the past?
They say love's worth waitin' for
What's love if you can't affordâ€”
To spend all your time bein' hurt? I can't take no more
What it was, it just ain't no more
See, I can never tell what's real and fake no more
I don't know what to say no more
I guess my definition of love ain't the same as yours
Like I've been in this place before
Way more times than I shoulda been
Tryna break out of the box that they put us in
And I caught myself thinkin' like way back
Thinkin' 'bout me and you and what we coulda been
First, you hate me then love me again
You start to miss me then we fuckin' again
Then we back to fightin', you don't trust me and then
You forget about me and I'm nothin' again, like

[Verse 2]
I can't front, all the sex and the hair grey
But all the stress in my head, aye
See, I'm broken and you know it
Lately, I've been tryin' not to show it
So hit me on the late night, girl, when you need
And I'll be around, yeah, you know I'm still down
We fight, we fuck, it's back and forth
You front like you leavin', but you always end up comin' back for more
And that's real

[Pre-Hook]
Everybody knows you don't feel how I feel about you, girl
Everybody knows you fucked me over and I'm still about you, girl
Everybody knows I was nothing like your last
I should put you in the past
They thought me and you would never last

[Hook]
But we fight then we break up, aye
Then we fuck 'til we make up, yeah
Through the nights that we wake up, aye
It ain't right, nah, it ain't love
But I need you, I need you
We fight then we break up, aye
Then we fuck 'til we make up, yeah
Through the nights that we wake up, aye
It ain't right, nah, it ain't love
But I need you, I need you
Need you, you, you, you, you
Need you
Need you, you, you, you, you

[Outro]
All these days I'm thinking of you
You're leaving me behind
I'll put it all behind
Just to be close to you
All these days I'm thinking of you
You're leaving me behind...
