[Hook]
Yeah
They say you gotta fight for the ones you love
Shit, I guess I ain't worth it
But I was tryna work things out with you
Yeah, I know I ain't perfect, look
I know he doesn't love you like he should
Baby, you could do better, fuck
I might have had way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
Yeah
Way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
Uh
Way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
I might have had way 2 much to drink, way 2 much

[Verse 1]
I know that you've moved on, but I'm still here
Tell me if love is something you still fear
I'm textin' you drunk, in my vision blurry as fuck, but it's funny 'cause all these memories, shit, they still clear
Don't try to say I wasn't down for you
You needed me, I stuck around for you
See, you was all I ever needed, babe
I tried to change my life around for you
I guess I wasn't enough
Sprite is dirty as you did me, I should pour you a cup
'Cause both of us in the wrong
I know you moved on, but you don't love him like you say you do, I'm callin' you bluff
I know you hated when I hit you on that late night tip
Look, but everyone around me on some fake-type shit
I'm losin' touch and I just needed something real in my life
Now I don't wanna have to pop a fucking pill to get right
I'm too drunk to keep drinkin', I should chill for the night
But on the real, shit, I wish you was still in my life
But they say

[Hook]
They say you gotta fight for the ones you love
Shit, I guess I ain't worth it
But I was tryna work things out with you
Yeah, I know I ain't perfect, look
I know he doesn't love you like he should
Baby, you could do better, fuck
I might have had way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
Yeah
Way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
Uh
Way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
I might have had way 2 much to drink, way 2 much

[Verse 2]
Hennessy inside me, I just don't know where to start now
Drinkin' out this bottle 'til it's empty as your heart now
Calm down, yeah, I see you creepin' on her
But all my Xs turned to Zs, I started sleepin' on her
But it's crazy how we want that person more when they gone, uh
Shady how you played me like the words to this song, fuck
Tried to make it last, I know I fucked up in the past
But shit, I never had the intention of doin' you wrong, I mean
I know exactly what you saw, I've been to Hell, too
You was tryin' not to fall, but shit, I fell, too
I couldn't tell you why I was seein' all my exes at the W Hotel, I took a L, too
Love tells lies, this liquor speaking the truth
Missed call notification, I'm hopin' it's you
But I tried to give you the world, you just wanted some space
But when I push myself away, I just get closer to you, I mean

[Hook]
They say you gotta fight for the ones you love
Shit, I guess I ain't worth it
But I was tryna work things out with you
Yeah, I know I ain't perfect, look
I know he doesn't love you like he should
Baby, you could do better, fuck
I might have had way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
Yeah
Way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
Uh
Way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
I might have had way 2 much to drink, way 2 much
