[Hook]
I regret the things that I've done to you
But I just got too much pride to go run to you
I never stopped feeling the love for you
I just stopped being the one for you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, the love I have for you is irreplaceable, yeah
I know I made my share of mistakes with you
I know I broke your heart
But I wish I could pick up every single piece and put 'em all back in place for you
But you see, the truth is
The both of us know, the pain is always there
But sometimes it don't really show
Sometimes we run from what we already know
But I gotta be honest right now, baby I don't wanna let go
See, I feel the distance, and every time we talk
I feel like something's missing
I thought you were the one, but it just feels so different
Even my heart tells me to leave
But I still don't listen cause I don't want nobody else
If I had one wish, I just want you all to myself
But it's hard to give love when it's love that you've never felt
See, I feel the pain deep in my blood
It's crazy how we love people that hurt us and hurt people we love

[Hook]
I regret the things that I've done to you
But I just got too much pride to go run to you
I never stopped feeling the love for you
I just stopped being the one for you

[Verse 2]
You tryna fight me and I'm tryna speak to you
This thing we call love, what does it mean to you?
I pull out your seat for you
I'm loyal and sweet to you
Tryin' to explain baby, this heart, you see it beats for you
But you take that for granted, the more I try, the less you hear
I just don't understand it
See, I would give you the world, the stars and all the planets
But every time we talk, you got your guard up, so I'm asking
'Should I even be mad at you?'
'Should I pack my shit up and leave, and never come back for you?'
All I wanted was time, was that too much to ask from you?
I know I made mistakes, I'm the first to admit
But why every time that we fight, you were the first one to split
Plus your friends, always up in your ear, see
You might be with me physically, but yo, you're not really here
I can tell I'm not who you thinking of anymore
I'll always love you, I'm just not in love anymore

[Hook]
I regret the things that I've done to you
But I just got too much pride to go run to you
I never stopped feeling the love for you
I just stopped being the one for you
