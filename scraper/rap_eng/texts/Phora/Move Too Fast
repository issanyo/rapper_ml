Move too fast
Yeah, I know I probably move way too fast
Yeah, I know I probably move too fast
Yeah, I know I probably move way too fast
But truth is, I would've waited for you
Don't let this get to your head
But no girl could ever take me from you
And all my friends say I'm stuck on you
See, I hate to love you
Yeah, see, I just move too fast
So I couldn't end up staying for you
They say, "The only way to know that love is real is when you hate each other"
They say, "The only way to know that love is real is when you hate each other"
Yeah, see, I just move too fast
So I couldn't end up staying for you

[Verse]
I know I move too fast
Couldn't have a future with you when you stuck in the past
It's like, you let go, I started getting attached
I put you first, you said I'm just like your last, damn
That's when I start think to myself "Did you even care?
Or was I lost looking for a love that wasn't there?"
In a world full of snakes, I was real to you
You'll never know how I feel for you, I'd kill for you
But I was your cure, you were my disease
I was saving you, but you were killing me
I seen a person in you that you couldn't see
But you just wanted me to be someone I couldn't be
Well love is like a rose, flawless to the eyes
Beautiful at first, but eventually it dies
Truth brings pain, but that's beauty in the lies
So I'd rather be lied to than feel this emptiness inside
Had to subtract my ex's, you the one in my equation
But why you let 'em divide us over something they were saying?
I don't get it love, you push away, but say you miss my love
Gave you all I had, made me feel like I ain't give enough
Said you'd never quit on me, but now you giving up
See, I would die for you, but you can't even live for us
So, now we pretend like we don't exist
But we both know it wasn't supposed to end like this
I know I...
