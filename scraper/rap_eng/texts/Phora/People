[Intro]
Goin' through, goin' through
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
I've been going through all these highs and these lows
Don't get too close to people homie they come and they go
Watch your back when you're round em'
Homie cause you never know
These people, people

[Verse 1]
See I just can't get close to people no more
I just can't connect with no one like I used to before
I know exactly what they using me for
Lettin' me down cause every time they come around they always asking for more
Yeah I've been dealin' with the pressure homie
They quick to test ya homie
People in ya life either a blessing or a lesson homie
And all they expectations killin' my vibe
Always talkin' bout such and such while they up in my ride
Like, so and so's fake they two faced and they a snake
But I bet you what they seen will probably give em' a 5
And shake they hand say "how you doin', where you been, we should chill"
And these the same motherfuckers that always say "keep it real"
Man I ain't tryna hear that shit
These people talking too much and being too loud can't be near that shit
Cause people never had no loyalty, never had no respect
Turn on each other for a check man I don't feel that shit
But got the nerve to ask why I don't come around no more
Honestly dog i can't fuck with these clowns no more
If it ain't uplifting my people or putting food on my mama's plate
I ain't got time to waste i can't be down no more
Cause I've been

[Hook]
I've been going through all these highs and these lows
Don't get too close to people homie they come and they go
Watch your back when you're round em'
Homie cause you never know
These people, people

[Verse 2]
They might wanna see you do good but never better than them
And if they crossed the line once, don't ever let 'em again
You see I keep my circle small for my people I've risked it all
If you family homie you family there was never no friends
But it's funny what these cats do for money it just disgust me
And these ladies always saying they love me I know they lust me man
Trust me, find someone you can trust and you lucky
It's always pretty girls that do something that makes them ugly
Man it's crazy out here
These niggas leaving single moms with babies out here
Yeah even in the summertime it's shady out here
Said even in the summertime it's shady out here (shady out here)
But these people so quick to judge and these people so quick to leave
And these people so quick to turn their back you don't got what they need
And I'm sick of people calling me fam knowing damn well
They wouldn't pay for my bail if I was sitting in a cell
But, if the tables would turn what would I do?
Probably give all I have left just to make sure they cool
Some people say that's my problem but I believe in my Karma
You ain't got to look out for me I'ma still look out for you

[Hook]
I've been going through all these highs and these lows
Don't get too close to people homie they come and they go
Watch your back when you're round em'
Homie cause you never know
These people, people
