[Verse 1]
Baby you should come through, I gotta party for two
Relax, recline and tell me what you want me to do
You got twenty-five missed calls and all of 'em dudes
But all these niggas really do is make it harder for you
Cause you know you got everything a man needs
Everything he wants, you're like the girl in every mans dreams
So tell me how you ended up with me
Cause if your pops saw us together, he probably wouldn't agree
But I mean, the Hennessy got me feeling some type of way about you
When I see you, I just don't know what to say about you
Cause I see you got your head did, nails done
Angel in the skies, it's like heaven is where you fell from
But you just came from the liquor store with a bottle for me
Love it when you get your Marylin on and your model for me
You whisper to me you never down with no sucker
You got the mind of a hustler, baby girl you must've got it from me

[Hook]
Tell me I own it, tell me it's all me
Tell me you fell in love the very second that you saw me
Look, tell me you need me and you want me all alone
Cause there ain't nothing wrong with getting in my zone right now
Tell me I own it, tell me it's all me
Tell me you fell in love the very second that you saw me
Look, tell me you need me and you want me all alone
Cause there ain't nothing wrong with getting in my zone right now

[Verse 2]
Just feel that Cali breeze blowing all through your aura
Love how you see the difference between Marco and Phora
Cause not many of em' do, see you deserve it all
But you ain't worried bout no dope cause you got plenty of it too
So what's up? We should take a plane trip to the islands
It'll be good for once, won't have to go sleep to some sirens
Cause I've been stressing out lately, I know you could tell
Cause to tell the truth, without you I've been going through hell
So what's the deal shit, we could probably make us a mill
On some Bonnie and Clyde shit, just let me know how you feel
For real, you so elegant, smooth to the touch
I bet everybody wish that they was us
So what's up, you gon' be here throughout my ups and my downs
And if they kick me to the ground, would you still be around
Won't say you ain't gotta worry about a thing no more
Cause what good is the sunshine if that rain don't pour

[Hook]
Tell me I own it, tell me it's all me
Tell me you fell in love the very second that you saw me
Look, tell me you need me and you want me all alone
Cause there ain't nothing wrong with getting in my zone right now
Tell me I own it, tell me it's all me
Tell me you fell in love the very second that you saw me
Look, tell me you need me and you want me all alone
Cause there ain't nothing wrong with getting in my zone right now
