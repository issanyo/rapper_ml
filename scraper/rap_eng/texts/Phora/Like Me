[Verse: 1]
Girl if I was him I'd never make you feel like that
Hate to be blunt but I just got to keep it real like that
I'll never know why he'd wanna make you feel like that
But if you were mine babe, yeah, if you were mine babe
If you were mine I would give you all the love that you need from me
Treat you like you royalty, you a queen to me
I'mma show you what you worth, what you mean to me
Probably make you fall in love, make you fiend for me
Fuck you so good till you dream of me
Ain't no question, I got you
Girl, it's just something about you
I don't know no one that's good enough for you
But baby that nigga ain't nothing without you
She just want to role in the Benzo
Roll one up, blow the smoke out the window
Says she only gets high when she feel low
And she trying to hide her feelings but her friends know
Her friends know that she better off alone
Should've left that nigga
Mama even said she don't respect that nigga
Wish she'd never met that nigga
Baby girl, you should move on and forget that nigga

[Chorus]
For a nigga like me
Cause I can guarantee he ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy where you at right now
You're way too good to take him back right now
So where you at right now?

[Verse: 2]
He got nothing to say
He just want to fuck around, he just stuck in his ways
He's no different from these niggas, they all one in the same
And every time he fucks you over, you the one that he blames
Look, to be honest girl you better off alone
Always worry 'bout who sending 'em messages to his phone
You don't need him, baby, you deserve better
You should've known you was better off on your own
But these things take time
Girl, he wasn't loyal he was fucking with your mind
Not saying I'm better, but that won't happen if you're mine
Baby, not ever, he did you wrong too many times
You looking for something that you ain't never gonna find
Cause you way too good for a nigga not to give you what you need
You deserve better, you need someone like me
Like me, no telling what that might be

[Chorus]
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can guarantee he ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy where you at right now
You're way too good to take him back right now
So where you at right now?
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can guarantee he ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy where you at right now
You're way too good to take him back right now
So where you at right now?

[Bridge]
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy where you at right now
You're way too good to take him back right now
So where you at right now?
So where you at right now?
So where you at right now?
I can tell you ain't happy where you at right now
You're way too good to take him back right now
So where you at right now?

[Chorus]
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can guarantee he ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy where you at right now
You're way too good to take him back right now
So where you at right now?
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can guarantee he ain't never did it like me
I ain't saying you need a nigga like me
But I can tell you ain't happy where you at right now
You're way too good to take him back right now
So where you at right now?
