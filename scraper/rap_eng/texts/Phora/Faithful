[Hook]
She just needs someone who's faithful
Someone to be real with her
Someone who takes their time
Learn to love and build with her
Someone who understands
Aye, someone who understands
She just needs someone who's faithful
Someone to be real with her
Someone who takes their time
Learn to love and build with her
Someone who understands
Someone who understands

[Verse]
Yeah, you need someone to be faithful
You need somebody to save you
You need somebody who knows what you're worth
You don't need someone to change you
You need somebody to love you
You need somebody that trusts you
You need somebody who takes time
You don't need someone to rush you
I know you've been running from all these feelings
You just can't take it
Yeah, you've been trying to hide love
But when it's real love, you can't fake it
Look, I know what you've been through
So we can take our time and be patient
She gave her heart to me, made me promise not to go break it
But she never found what she was searching for
Yeah, you can tell by the smile on her face
She been hurt before
Look, I know your last man never put you first before
But you've been stressing less and you've been working more
I can tell you've been working more
Uh, too many late night "come throughs"
Not enough "I love yous"
She ain't really have real love in her life
And she feel like she might just lose it
But she don't know what's been missing
She just needs someone different
She just needs someone that she can run to
Someone that she can run to

[Hook]
She just needs someone who's faithful
Someone to be real with her
Someone who takes their time
Learn to love and build with her
Someone who understands
Aye, someone who understands
She just needs someone who's faithful
Someone to be real with her
Someone who takes their time
Learn to love and build with her
Someone who understands
Someone who understands
She just needs someone who's faithful
