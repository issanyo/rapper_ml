[Intro: Phora]
Yeah, this is for anyone who's ever had a broken dream
Or a fucked up childhood, never lose hope

[Verse 1: Phora]
See I was raised by a single mother
No father figure, little sister, never had a brother
Never had another man teach me how to be one
Yeah, momma had a man, but he was never calling me son
And even if he did yo I would never take him serious
Cause people say they love me, but it's funny
Cause I don't think they know what love really is
Cause love ain't when you hurt a person
Love ain't avoiding a problem, you should be getting involved
Love ain't, when you pick somebody up by the neck
Then you grab his head and you slam it right into the wall
I was a troubled kid in school, so I just kept to myself
Psychologists ordered me medicine, it never did help
Cause every time I took it, I was never myself
I wasn't G, I never had a strap next to my belt
Just a regular kid that never joined the sports team
And every time I'd tried to talk to a girl, she'd ignore me
Started hanging around stupid kids and broke a few laws
Had a few problems, painted a few walls
But one day, something happened that changed my life forever
Something that I'll always remember
I said one day, something happened that changed my life forever
Something that I'll always remember

[Verse 2: Phora]
I was walking home after school with two friends from my class
And then I seen a sketchy face walk past
But at the time I didn't think of it much
Cause 'round here there's always sketchy cats, tweakers and such
So I just kept walking till I got to King's Drive
Then seen a bunch of motherfuckers giving me the stink eye
They started surrounding me, stopped me in my place
And right outside the circle I seen a familiar face
A cat that I used to be tight with
Never had no problems with him
But I guess he's smoking some nice shit
He came right towards me
I said, "Fuck it, then fine, let's catch a fair one"
Then caught a cheap shot from behind
I ran, they tripped me and caught me
They stomped me and kicked me
Kicks to my face, punches to my ribs and my kidneys
Then what happened next, you just might not believe
But everybody scattered, I was trying to breathe
Students, parents, and teachers, their watching me bleed
But nobody did shit, I was watching 'em leave
As I was dying, bleeding, losing my conscious
Flashed backs of reminders of things I've never accomplished
Everything turned white, then everything was fine
No more worries, nothing on my mind
No pain, no nothing, I guess it was my time
Then my whole life flashed right in front of my eyes
But all of the sudden I snapped back to reality
Took a look around but no ambulance was surrounding me
Guess this is how it ends, huh?
I guess this is what my momma meant when she said watch your friends, huh?
Guess I should have listened, but now it's too late
Taking my last breath getting closer to my fate
And right when I felt I was good with dying
A voice in my head said, "Don't stop, keep trying"
So I got my ass up, walked to school and dialed nine one one
True story, fuck what you think you could do for me
Fifteen years old, just another victim
Just another kid that would end up dead or in prison
Got to the hospital, the doctor said they don't know if I'mma live
Immediate surgery tube through my ribs
I could barely breathe, I was bleeding out
That's when I met God, yeah I can see him now
With a collapsed lung and two stab wounds
I'm losing blood quick, but I ain't going that soon
Everybody left, but I had strength in myself
"I'mma be aight", that's what I say to myself
Yeah, and sure enough I kept on breathing
Almost paralyzed for the next three weekends
Private numbers calling, death threats to my family
Even named my little sis, so how can you be mad at me
When I told you that I fear for our safety
Cause no street cred is worth my mothers place G
They asked me who it was and I let em' know
I ain't ashamed of my choice and I don't regret it yo
Cause truth is, I don't follow no one's rules
I do what I feel's right, I ain't no one's mule
The whole thing was recorded and put up online
But you should know, if you can't do the time, don't do the crime
See I ain't no G, just a man with a passion
But I always took responsibility for my actions
I never hurt a soul in my life, I'm a family man
Always kept my word, so tell me how bad of a man I am
Cause when it comes down to it, all you got is you
And we all gotta survive, do what you gotta do
Fifteen years old, left in the dust
The world taught me never to love and never to trust
Nah, but now I know my purpose, now I know what I'm here for
Now I know what I've been waiting all these years for
Fifteen years old, left in the dust
The world taught me never to love and never to trust
Nah, but now I know my purpose, now I know what I'm here for
Now I know why I've been waiting all these years
Yours truly
