INTRO VOCALS:

I'm surprise I'm still standin' right here
I was livin' in a nightmare
Never be able to breath again

Anthro Beats!!!

VERSE 1:

First off
I ain't in this for the Dead Presidents
The nice whips fly chicks or gold necklaces
I do this in hopes that my Auntie gets off of the pipe
N the small chance of possibly changing a persons life
I wanna make things right
These kids need some guidance
This generations lullaby is gunshots n sirens
I'm here to make a difference fuck the code of the streets
I refuse to be a victim to my own self defeat
Don't let em get you trapped
Cuz there's only 2 places that you'll end up
N I'm pretty sure you know just where that's at
Fuck the fame, fuck the money,fuck gettin' put on the map
I'm just trynna come together
Brown, White, Yellow, Black
It don't matter what color
N before you put that bullet in his head
Just make sure you think of his mother
And his little sister cryin' when they see him him at his funeral
But in the streets I guess that's business as usual

HOOK:

And I took so many chances in my life
I'm surprise I'm still standing right here
I never thought i'll make it yo
Just a couple of years ago, I was living in a nightmare
Knife in my chest, Knife in my back
Never thought i'll be able to breath again
But now I know I'm here for a reason but
I just don't think this muthaf's see it yet
I just don't think these muthaf's see it yet

VERSE 2:

I dont write music to convince you to believe in me
I write music to convince you to believe in you
Stay positive, keep smiling, and one day youâ€™ll see
Anything is possible & you could make your dreams come true,
This is for the Kids that past before they had a chance to live
Their memories live on throughout my words
And If I had to give my life so you could hold the ones you lost
And hear them laugh again, I would do it in a second
All I ask is this, When im gone remember
All I ever wanted was to make a difference
Pray my sister graduates, I hate to miss it
But if my time comes you won't hear me complain
But since we still here let me speak to you
So just press play n listen
If I ever made a million dollars
I'll create a program to help these kids get into college
Even tho my ass didn't pass the 11th grade
Momma is still proud and that's all that matters for heavens sake
I let the haters hate, cuz my family will always love me
Nothing left to say, didn't make it here by getting lucky
I'm playing by the rule but yo I gotta confess
Last night I felt like quitting cuz all of the stress
Got the world on my shoulder n pain all over my chest
Plus my girl is tripping, she keeps thinking I'm callin' my ex
But somehow, someway, I kept on pushin'
Never show my pain cuz you never know who's lookin'
When you show weakness they try to bring you down
N talk behind your back & diss you when you're not around
But they will never stop me
I'mma change the world
Dont belive me
Just Watch me
Heyyy...
