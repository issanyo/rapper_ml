[Intro]
Sometimes pain runs deeper than blood
Sometimes karma comes back on the people you love
Sometimes we gotta let go and turn the other way
We just fightin' for another day
Cause everything has a cause, you may not like the effect
A heart full of pain and a life full of regrets
Forced to make certain choices that you might not respect
In this world full of hate, just a child of neglect
You may not like the effect, life full of regrets
You might not respect, a child of neglect

[Verse 1]
He was breathin' in cigarrette smoke, watching cartoons
Loud yells comin' from the other room
Landlord bangin' on the door askin' where the fuckin' rent at cause it's 30 days overdue
Nobody answers it
They was smokin' up the house like they ain't know that shit was cancerous
But his mom is still tryna quit
She ain't got no one to depend on to provide for her kids
She's working 2 jobs
Barely makin' enough to fill his stomach
It's still filled with nothing
Hard times, she can feel 'em coming
And it's been that while for a while
She raisin' a fatherless child, you can see the pain in her smile
She got unpaid bills piling on up the counter
No matter how close to the edge she got something about her
And never let her lose hope
Even when she hit rock bottom, she feels the noose around her neck
It's just a loose rope
But it's only getting tighter, suffocating her slowly
She's a lover and a fighter, but something just keeps her lonely
She got a collect call but she already know who it's from
She took a deep breath, answered the phone and begun
She said I gotta move on with my life, I told you it's done
Plus it's been 2 months since you spoke to your son
It's not about me and it's not about you anymore
It's not about running the streets and acting a fool anymore
You've been gone for 7 years, their's nothing you can do anymore
Cause I've lost everything and I just can't bear to lose anymore
You see, theirs somebody else
Not because I'm in love, but cause I needed some help
The type of help you can't provide
I'm sick of waiting
I'm sick of sittin' around knowing you might not make it out alive
Sick of not havin' somebody by my side
Sick of our kids askin "where's our daddy?"
I'm sick of tellin' them these lies
I'm just sick of it all
And if you ever met parole and have plans for the future, please don't get us involved
Don't call, don't write
And most of all, leave my child alone
And before he could say a word
All he heard is a dial tone

[Verse 2]
As his mother put down the phone he heard her saying
"God, I really need you right now, please just show me a sign, my heart is bleeding right now"
But he was only a kid, so he really didn't really know much
Still tryna understand why his mother cried so much
Father's Day was the worst
Plus they ain't had no money in the bank, so it felt like every holiday was a curse
And his birthday just passed
He's getting ready for a lonely Christmas
They say his dad is gone for business
But he knows the difference
Starting to forget his father's face and what he looked like
No bedtime stories, no good mornings, no good night
Just a good luck from the judge, his life would change with a sentence
Slam the gavel down, he's found guilty of all the offenses
On the other side of the fence, left his child defenseless
Now he fends for himself, but he feels so relentless
His momma's boyfriend drinks until his demons come out
The liquor takes control of his soul, he don't speak with his mouth
He speaks with his fist, disagree get beat til your pissed
The type of pain that'll make you put a knife deep in your wrist
Speak with his fist, the type of pain that'll make you put a knife deep in your wrist

[Bridge]
You didn't have a clue
That you got people who
You're affecting too
It's not just you..

[Outro]
Sometimes the choices you make, they don't only effect you
But they also effect the people you love and care about
You see, I wish I could say that it's never too late
But I would only be lying to you
Because time and the people we love
Are the only two things we can never get back in this world
