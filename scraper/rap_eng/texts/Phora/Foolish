[Hook: Wolvang]
You ain't got to say a word
You don't got to tell me how it feels to love somebody like me You know I can tell you're hurt
I'm just trying to make you feel the way that I feel
Want you kissing my neck, All laid out on your bed
No, off fighting instead
And I know I'm a fool for what I put you through
I don't care about whats going around in their heads
And no I don't mind if you've got to run sometimes

[Verse 1: Phora]
Yea, Feel like I've been here before, like I've felt this very feeling before
When I try and think of you less I just start feeling it more
I was just to scared to open the doors, wish we could see what's in store
For the future I just can't predict it
Even after the pain you inflicted, I'm still addicted
My friends say I'm tripping, but when I tripped I must have fell, And when I fell I must have fell for you
All my problems I just don't know who to tell them to
Wish I could talk to you, but I called your phone and your service was unavailable
You must have changed your number or something
Had my heart cold as a winter it's funny cause that summer was coming
That summer was when I lost myself
Around July, the fireworks were going off but oh how lost I felt  My guilty conscious always eating at me
Lord knows regardless of all the things we can't be
I just wanna see you happy
I know I'm a fool for what I put you through
I was running from my feelings I was pushing through
And I know I probably ain't give enough to you
But I just can't take back what I couldn't do

[Hook: Wolvang]
You ain't got to say a word
You don't got to tell me how it feels to love somebody like me You know I can tell your hurt
I'm just trying to make you feel the way that I feel
Want you kissing my neck, All laid out on your bed
No, off fighting instead
And I know I'm a fool for what I put you through
I don't care about whats going around in their heads
And no I don't mind if you've got to run sometimes
