[Chorus]
I know what it's like to feel so hopeless
But you gotta keep going man
Just stay focused, just stay focused, yeah, just stay focused
Focus on the good shit, forget about the past
Focus on what you got, not the things you never had
Cus it ain't that bad, as the world keeps spinning
Either you dyin' or you livin'

[Verse 1]
Ever since i can remember they said i couldn't do it
Tatts all over told them my future was ruined
But i told them "get to know me first yeah, I'm still human"
Grandpa asked me "what the hell you think you doing?"
I told him "i'm making music, you should take a listen
I know i ain't the best but i ain't talking about no bitches
I'm talkin' about no cars or cooking crack in moms kitchen
I'm talkin' about life and everything that's in my vision"
Man i swear I'm so thankful for the things i was given
Speak on what i learned, hoping i can make a difference
Speak to my boy that keeps going back to prison
At the end of the day you gotta pay for your decisions
I swear man i miss him, never get the chance to visit
Ask what my goal is, it's just to keep living, just keep living
Yeah, it's just to keep living, just to keep ..

[Chorus]
I know what it's like to feel so hopeless
But you gotta keep going man
Just stay focused, just stay focused, yeah, just stay focused
Focus on the good shit, forget about the past
Focus on what you got, not the things you never had
Cus it ain't that bad, as the world keeps spinning
Either you dyin' or you livin'

[Verse 2]
Even when it's all bad, i still keep my head up
It'll go away, i promise, life will get better
And i hate to see my boy walking around with a Beretta
Gotta watch his back he said our police don't protect us
He ain't't got a girl cus he thinks he gon' get set up
All that's on his mind is makin' that chedda
And i said that's cool, but what you gonna do when you get it?
Your gonna buy some weed
Your gonna put it in the bank and get interest
Listen, just think of yo' future
If you got that money, don't think these cats will hesitate to shoot you
Look, all I'm saying is be cool bro
Never heard from him again,i hope he's cool tho
I'm doing things i never thought of
Came a long way from sleeping in my niggas honda
Ask me for a quarter, i'll probably give you a dollar
More you do good, less chance of meeting karma
I try to stay away from drama, cus everywhere i go now
Been so many places, but it's nothing like my hometown
Heard some people hate us here, they don't even know us
Yeah I'm still a kid but these niggas need to grow up
And to tell you the truth, I'm the only person i can think of that's
Buying kids from the hood, cheese burgers and sodas
I just wanna make a change, man i swear
The money and the fame ain't why I'm here, i been working so hard
Y'all should be glad for me, instead of everyone turnin' they back on me
But it's alright, yeah it's alright

[Chorus]
I know what it's like to feel so hopeless
But you gotta keep going man
Just stay focused, just stay focused,yeah, just stay focused
Focus on the good shit, forget about the past
Focus on what you got, not the things you never had
Cus it ain't that bad, as the world keeps spinning
Either you dyin' or you livin'
