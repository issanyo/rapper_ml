[Hook]

She said, 'No matter what you do
No matter where you go
Baby you'll always be the one for me. (always be the one for me)
Even if you leave I'll never let you go
Even after all the things you done to me. (all the things done to me)

No matter what you do
No matter where you go
Baby you'll always be the one for me. (always be the one for me)
I just thought I had to let you know
Even after all the things you've done to me. (all the things you've done to me

[First Verse]
She said, "I'm here for you no matter what, even after all the fame, groupies and the cameras

Even after all your so called homies turned their backs, they say they down but yo' their word ain't jack

In fact, even after the curtains close and the moneys gone
I'm still here even after all the times you've done me wrong
Know I gotta have some patients with you
Girls probably sending you naked pictures
Hope you ain't laying with'em
Yeah, and if you ever do leave
All I really want is for you to promise you'll take me with yah(promise you'll take me with yah)
Or at least take a memory, cause if you gone I don't know how much love is gonna be left in me
And when you next to me at night it sets the mood right
Think about our future as I stare into the mood light
I'm the only one who truly understands you
I know what you thinkin' I don't ever have to ask you
But every time your gone, apart of me is missing
When you come back my love for you is never different
Now the feeling never changes
I here for you wether your broke, dirty and smelly
These girls love you cause you famous."

She said, 'No matter what you do
No matter where you go
Baby you'll always be the one for me. (always be the one for me)
Even if you leave I'll never let you go
Even after all the things you done to me. (all the things done to me)

No matter what you do
No matter where you go
Baby you'll always be the one for me. (always be the one for me)
I just thought I had to let you know
Even after all the things you've done to me. (all the things you've done to me

[Second Verse]

Look
She said, ' I know you stressin' but you drinking to much
I feel like we growin' distance
We ain't speakin' enough
Every time I try to talk to with you, you say you 'ok.'
But I know something is wrong, and I can see through your bluff
I just wanna know what I can do to help you get through it
Communication is key, but sometimes you act stupid
Sometimes you play games
Sometimes you so difficult
Sometimes you drive me crazy
And sometimes we on a different note
But I know, I can feel it in my soul
Whatever brought us together had plans for us to be close
I mean, just don't take me for granted
If you want every second of my time then you can have it
The only thing you don't have is the right to take advantage
I hope you never try cause my heart is already damaged
And
I don't expect for you to fix it
But I expect that you respect my feelings and you listen
That's why I'm here
And you need me like I need you
No matter what I gotchu, and never will I leave you
So grab my hand and tell me you won't ever go
I wanna say 'forever' but you never know
