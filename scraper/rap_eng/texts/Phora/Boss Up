[Chorus]
Boss up, I'm just tryna win, just tryna boss up
I be on my own so I don't talk much
Fuck with me, just pray I don't get crossed off, crossed off
Boss up, I'm just tryna win, just tryna boss up
I be on my own so I don't talk much
Fuck with me, just pray I don't get crossed off, crossed off
Boss up, I'm just tryna win, just tryna boss up
I be on my own so I don't talk much
Fuck with me, just pray I don't get crossed off, crossed off

[Verse]
Too much on my mind I just been workin'
Puttin' all these days in I'm just hopin' that this shit's worth it
I ain't got no time, I'm just tryna find me and my purpose
'Cause nothing here's really promised, nothing here's really certain
Yeah, aye, aye
Fake friends switch sides, look, I can never switch sides (aye)
I'm just count this money, switch these lanes, switch my ride (aye)
Now they say is my time (aye), I'm just tryna stay alive (yeah)
Almost lost my life three times, I just gotta thank God (aye)
That's for sure, sometimes we ain't in control
Shit, I been through Hell and back there's some things they just don't know
That's for real, I don't talk, rest in peace my nigga Ryan
All this hate, all this pain, I swear this shit don't ever stop, uh yeah
Y'all shoulda seen this shit coming though
Fake friends, I don't fuck with those
Flow sick like a runny nose
And these fake rappers they all come and go, yeah yeah
I should've seen this shit comin' up
Flow sick like a runny nose
And these fake rappers they all come and go

[Bridge]
Distance, your girl hit me up, I keep it distant
She see us, I know she see the difference
All my niggas talented and gifted
Y'all cannot compare this shit is different
Your girl hit me up, I keep it distant
She see us, I know she see the difference
All my niggas talented and gifted
Hold up, run that shit back

[Chorus]
Boss up, I'm just tryna win, just tryna boss up
I be on my own so I don't talk much
Fuck with me, just pray I don't get crossed off, crossed off
Boss up, I'm just tryna win, just tryna boss up
I be on my own so I don't talk much
Fuck with me, just pray I don't get crossed off, crossed off
Boss up, I'm just tryna win, just tryna boss up
I be on my own so I don't talk much
Fuck with me, just pray I don't get crossed off, crossed off
