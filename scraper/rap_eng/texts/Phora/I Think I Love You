[Verse 1]
Roses are red and violets are blue
Why does every love song remind me of you?
Why can’t I make my mind up and decide what to do
I’m trying to write these songs
I always end up writing about you
I hope that you don’t mind, sometimes I think about you
And I wish I could press rewind
Whisper in my ear, she send chills down my spine
Some people travel across the world and still don’t ever find
This thing we call love, angel in my eyes
Like you were sent from up above
(Yeah, like you were sent from up above)
Look, see I catch myself staring I hope you don’t mind
Baby I'm just taking time to thank god that you're mine
So anytime you need I'll come through
Nothing comes between us it's just me it's just you
I never knew that love was so true
And if I have to tell the truth, girl
I’ve never been in love before you

[Chorus]
Baby I'm the one for you
And that's for real
Never been in love
I never got the feel
Certain type of love you give to me
Trust you give to me
This is just the way I feel

I think I love you

[Verse 2]
Look
You remind me of summertime and
Ice cones, sunshine, beach waves, night shows
Love songs, you the reason why I write those
You the reason why the heart emojis in my iPhone
Every king need a queen
I swear that you the girl I used to see in my dreams
Back then love was never my thing
See I think I love you I just don't know if I know what it means
But, you take me to a place where I've never been
Let your guard down, you can let me in
When I'm feeling low you are my medicine
Make love till I give yo ass a set of twins
I hope it never ends, your loyalty never breaks it never bends
It only feels right, so fuck stayin the night
Baby you should go pack yo bags
Come settle in

[Chorus]
Baby I'm the one for you
And that's for real
Never been in love
I never got the feel
Certain type of love you give to me
Trust you give to me
This is just the way I feel

I think I love you
