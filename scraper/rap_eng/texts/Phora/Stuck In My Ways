[Intro: Phora]
Yeah, all this pressure been getting to me lately
I just feel like everything changed, look

[Chorus: Phora]
Yeah, stuck in my ways again
She said I pray for you
She said I love you, but I need to stay away from you, uh
Stuck in my ways again
Yeah, look, stuck in my ways again
She said I pray for you
She said I love you, but I need to stay away from you
Stuck in my ways again

[Verse 1: Phora]
Yeah, look
Nothing ever stays the way it was
Loved you 'til I had nothing left
I just needed time to find myself
Needed more but you gave me less
Even dealt with all this pain for you
Promised you I'd stay the same for you
Now I'm losing everything I love and you say you want me to change for you, wait
I would never switch on myself just to be accepted by everybody else, look
Everybody fake, everybody two faced, everybody in it for themselves, uh
Everything fake to me, everyone a snake to me, all they ever wanna do is take from me
They say everybody needs someone, I just need everyone to stay the fuck away from me, look
They're telling me be careful who you love
These days everything numb
And sometimes, the person you would take a bullet for is standing right behind the gun
Maybe I just wasn't worth it to you
Maybe I just wasn't perfect for you
Truth is we could never work 'cause you just wanted me to be a different person for you, fuck

[Chorus: Phora]
Stuck in my ways again
She said I pray for you
She said I love you, but I need to stay away from you, uh
Stuck in my ways again
Yeah, look, stuck in my ways again
She said I pray for you
She said I love you, but I need to stay away from you
Stuck in my ways again

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
It's been like four months of going in circles, I know
But I'm a bit scarred, tryna figure out which way to go
We could've had a fucking blast, yeah, yeah
But I was tripping on the past, yeah, yeah
Lately I've been feeling stuck, down in the dumps, might need to jump
Miss me with that ''where were you, when I needed you'' look, Baby I'd be gone
It's gon be a long time 'fore home
You know that zone six my zone
Looking at this shit from different sides
Try not to pick a side
Ain't no more switching sides
Made it a mission
I know you wanna stay away
Considering the stakes
I thought that you could take it
I thought that we would make it
It's crazy how it all pans out
Tryna carry all my plans out
Wanna get the last dance out
But she won't even stick her hand out

[Chorus: Phora]
Stuck in my ways again
She said I pray for you
She said I love you, but I need to stay away from you, uh
Stuck in my ways again, uh, yeah, look
Stuck in my ways again
She said I pray for you
She said I love you, but I need to stay away from you, look, uh
Stuck in my ways again
