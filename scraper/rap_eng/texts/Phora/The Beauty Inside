[Verse 1]
Yea Look
Baby your beautiful
Don't ever let these fuckers tell you you're not
And keep it going when they tell you to stop
Just an angel with broken wings
The girl inside my dreams
Heaven must not be that far away
Because you fell from the top
You fell and you fought
Why you stressed out about how you looking love
Walking around your city, still feel like you ain't good enough
Why since you've been on my mind, I can't stop thinking bout your voice
Your smile, your lips, and your eyes
Don't need to lie you see I'm tryna get a grip
On you mind these other guys just tryna quick grip on your thighs
Sick of the lies I know your last man
He just didn't show you the real you
I see your soul your energy
I can connect they feel you I mean feel
In the spiritual sense way pass the physical
Your body don't need to be perfect
For me to be into you, I'm into you
I wanna show you my feelings that fit to you
Deep conversations, you need someone to listen too
Someone who opens up at the same time pays attention
To every word you say and understand how the things have been for you
Some people really got the word beautiful twisted
See it's not your clothes, body, or lipstick, that's materialistic
Beauty runs deeper than skin
Pass what the eyes can see
Deep inside your soul what TV wants you to be try to be
Like the skinny models in the magazines
That doesn't flatter me
Cause what inside you is what matters see

[Chorus]
See baby you took a hundred pictures wasn't happy with one
You tried on a hundred jeans, you wasn't happy with none
If you seen yourself through my eyes
Only then will you realize
Beauty isn't what you look like is, but it's who you become
I said you took a hundred pictures wasn't happy with one
You tried on a hundred jeans, you wasn't happy with none
If you see yourself through my eyes cause only then will you realize
Beauty isn't what you look like it's who you become

[Bridge]
They say beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
But sometimes the heart can see what invisible to the eyes
You see everything on the outside is temporary
The looks, the appearance, the makeup
It's the beauty on the inside that truly lasts forever

[Verse 2]
Your flaws are what makes you perfect
Love every inch in your body, head to your toe
Why when I look at you you get nervous, self conscious
About the way you look but girl you should know
That your eyes are beautiful, your smile is beautiful
You can hold conversations baby your mind is beautiful
Know what your worth there's no one you needa prove it too
And know what I mean when I say you're far from the usual
I appreciate, every single flaw in your body but they ain't flaws to me
That's what makes you special I told the world so they can all see
The stretch marks, the split ends don't mean your ain't fine
The crooked teeth, that smile doesn't mean it don't shine
Listen I know it's hard to be different
But must me hard not to be like these other girls
But you gifted, see I heard you wanted surgery
But baby just listen
All those things you feel you don't have ain't really missing
They just ain't meant to be, don't need to fix what they broken
God made you perfectly like the skies and the oceans
Like the stars and the sunsets and the clouds and they skies
Couldn't name a thing I would change about you baby no lie
Why you looking on Instagram at these models stop comparing yourself
Cause there's only one you in this world don't be scared of yourself
And your face is covered in make up, but you tryna hide
I know it's hard to live with yourself when your dying inside
But stop looking at yourself in the mirror picking your flaws out
A million beautiful things about you I'll point them all out
But I was guilty about not loving yourself too until, until I met you

[Chorus]
You baby you took a hundred pictures wasn't happy with one
You tried on a hundred jeans, wasn't happy with none
If you see yourself through my eyes only then will you realize
Beauty isn't what you look like but it's who you become
I said you took a hundred pictures wasn't happy with one
You tried on a hundred jeans wasn't happy with none
If you seen yourself through my eyes
Only then will you realize
Beauty isn't what you look like but it's who you become
