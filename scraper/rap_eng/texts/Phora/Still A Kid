[Intro: Screaming kids]

[Hook]
I'm still a kid, so
I still make mistakes
I just wanna live yo, before the good times fade away
I'm still a kid, so
So, I still make mistakes
I just wanna live yo, before the good times fade away

[Verse 1]
Look, ayo, I'm just another young katt coming from the bottom
I don't want no beef (naw), I don't want no problems
But y'all won't never get it right, I ain't scared
I just got better shit to do then fight amongst my pears
Honestly it kinda hurts and it's a shame, how
All the kids I use to know just wanna hate now
And as time passed, I seen who was really down
I never brought up the katts trynna bring me down
Cause that's just a waste of my time and time is precious and it's running out
I'm takin' what's mine
Everybody got that kid deep down inside of 'em
Some play with toys, some got the toys on aside of 'em
Finna do a nigga do, like he did when playing Grand Theft Auto
He's still a kid, so that pride is pretty hard to swallow
You wanna be the toughest kid on the block
And he was 'till that niggaa started hearing them shots
Kids killing kids, asking myself when will it stop
Another dead on the news, it makes me sick when I watch
I just wanna live my life before the now becomes a memory
And I just hope they remember me

[Hook]
I'm still a kid, so
I still make mistakes
I just wanna live yo, before the good times fade away
I'm still a kid, so
So, I still make mistakes
I just wanna live yo, before the good times fade away

[Interlude: Screaming kids]

[Verse 2]
Look, I'm still a kid and I'll prolly always will be
And I ain't trippin' if none of this rappers feel me
Cause it's what saved me from hanging thugs and packing guns
I just hope my mom is proud of what I've become
And when nobody believed in me and left me hangin'
Prospect was the only katt that said "I'm the one"
I never really understand until I grew a bit
He was the fuel to the flame that kept my future lit
He said "Imma change this generation way of life, so if you ain't lookin' for better days you ain't alive"
I ain't no different then your average Joe
I ain't got no superpowers, I just rap with a flow
So don't be mad if something happend and I cancel a show
Just know that I had to go, but I'll be back for some more
Yo, I wanna be a rolemodel to this kids and help
But it's hard to teach 'em to grow, when you' a kid yourself
And I just turned eighteen last month
And I'm still immature and I still can't front about
Me making the wrong decisions, even when I know it's not right, then I know the consequences
But I'm still a kid and I ain't using that as an excuse
I just got a lot to learn and that's the truth
Yeah, I'm still a kid, and I ain't usin' that as an excuse
I just got a lot to learn and that's the truth
I'm still a kid, and I ain't using that as an excuse
I just got a lot to learn and that's the truth, yo
Yo, I'm still a kid, and I ain't using that as an excuse
I'm still a kid

[Hook]
I'm still a kid, so
I still make mistakes
I just wanna live yo, before the good times fade away
I'm still a kid, so
So, I still make mistakes
I just wanna live yo, before the good times fade away
