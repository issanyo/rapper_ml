[Verse 1: Phora]
Yeah
It's been a while since I spoke to you, everything seems different now
I'm tryna focus, you've been out of frame, but it's crazy how I see the picture now
It's been a while since you've been around, me, I finally put the liquor down
Crazy how life is bittersweet, 'cause my grandpa is gettin' sicker now
Yeah, I've been tryin' not to lose touch, but all this stress is just too much
When I was young, it was me and him ridin' 'round the city just the two of us
Wish I spent more time with him, all the times that I held back
All this money in my bank account, but there ain't a way to buy health back
See, back then we was close, then I lost who I was
Gettin' close to my dreams, but further from who I love
What's meant to be is just meant to be, I don't think we could change that
I ain't sayin' I regret it now, I just wish I had them days back
And that's real

[Hook: Tiffany Evans]
Does it hurt to think of me? (think of me)
Wishin' your heart still belonged to me, yeah
'Cause when I close my eyes I'll be searching for you (searching for you)
Thinkin' of the ways I've been hurtin' for you (hurtin' for you)
I'll be here if you come look for me (look for me)

[Verse 2: Phora]
Yeah
It's been a while since I spoke to you, both of us gettin' older now
Life is movin' so fast for me, I just wish I had a way to slow it down
Wish I wasn't scared to open up, 'cause I ain't talked to my dad still
But he's stubborn though, that's where I get it from, he drinks Hennessy with his Advil
Everyone say I'm just like him; we smile hard and we hide tears
Even though I've seen him last month, I ain't seen my dad in like five years
And that gets to me, heart's heavy, I just can't adjust to these changes
Lost some people that was closest to me, now I'm losin' all of my patience
Ex girls say they still love me, old friends just come and go
Really I've been tryna move on, but I'm too afraid to end up alone
Too afraid to give my love, 'cause I'm too afraid I won't feel love
And I'm too afraid that I'll find love just to find out it's not real love
I got so many trust issues, wish I was there to uplift you
And even though we ain't close now, it's difficult to not miss you
But I wonder what you say to people when they speak about me
I know we both went our separate ways, I just wonder if you still think about me
That's real

[Hook: Tiffany Evans]
Does it hurt to think of me? (think of me)
Wishin' your heart still belonged to me (still belonged to me)
'Cause when I close my eyes I'll be searching for you (I'll think of you)
Thinkin' of the ways I've been hurtin' for you (of you)
I'll be here if you come look for me (if you come looking for me)

[Outro: Tiffany Evans]
If you come looking for me
If you come looking for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(If you come looking for me
If you come looking for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah)
