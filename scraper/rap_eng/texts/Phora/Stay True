[Pre-Hook]
Where the fuck were you when the teams feeling low?
No money in our pockets, ain't nobody at our show
Where the fuck were you when they all shot us down?
Us against the world you was no where to be found
Where the fuck were you dawg? Where the fuck were you?
Where the fuck were you man? Where the fuck were you
Now they show us love when we step up in this place
Like fuck em if they hating middle finger to your face!

[Hook]
Middle finger to your face
Middle finger to your face aye
Middle finger to your face
Now you want something from us but we can't do nun for you so long
(My nigga so long, so long, so long, my nigga so long)

[Post-Hook]
Can't catch up cause we gone haha! yeah we gone!
Yall slept on these motherfuckas for too fucking long
Now they show us respect but its way overdue
Through all this shit we stayed true but where the fuck were you?
Where the fuck were you?

[Bridge]
This is for anyone who's ever been told they couldn’t
Anyone who's ever been told they never would
The choice isn’t up to them, it's up to you

[Verse 1]
It was all I ever had, to them it was nothin but a dream
Felt like my voice was never heard
Felt like my work was never seen
Felt like my skill was overlooked
Felt like my heart was meant to break
Felt like my plan was meant to fail and my whole damn life was a mistake
But I kept on pushing till I broke
Got my ass back up and tried again
Then I lost my sanity and hope
Right before I lost all my friends
And I felt my time was coming close
Shit, I ain't had nothing left
But I never gave up on myself keep going till my very last breath
And no matter how hard I tried to show'em they would never understand
See I'm working on myself dawg, I'm trying to better who I am
See I had a vision no one else could see and ain't nobody else believe
Put my blood, sweat, my tears in this
Now everybody want a piece
But I'm like fuck that, fuck that
Hold up nigga fuck that								        Now we living life and we eating dawg you wanna come around? I don't trust that
Shout out to my niggas that stuck around
That N.O. DUB and that YT that be coming up from the underground
Man I could’ve swore I told y'all niggas
I could’ve swore I showed y'all niggas all my music you ain't give no fucks
You was just like so what? Now you say you wanna roll but
Where the fuck were you when the teams feeling low?
No money in our pockets, ain't nobody at our show

[Pre-Hook]
Where the fuck were you when they all just shot us down?
Us against the world you was no where to be found
Where the fuck were you dawg? Where the fuck were you?
Where the fuck were you man? Where the fuck were you?
Now they show us love when we step up in this place
Like fuck'em if they hating middle finger to your face!

[Hook]
Middle finger to your face
Middle finger to your face aye
Middle finger to your face
Now you want something from us but we can't do nothing for you so long
(My nigga so long, so long, so long, my nigga so long)

[Post-Hook]
Can't catch up cause we gone, yeah we gone!
Y'all slept on these motherfuckas for too fucking long
Now they show us respect, but it's way overdue
Through all this shit we stayed true but where the fuck were you? Where the fuck were you?
