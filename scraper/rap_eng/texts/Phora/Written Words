[Intro]
Foes turn jealous...
Growin' up I never felt it...
Misery loves company...
Come with me...
Friends...
Hard to show my love...
Misery loves company...
Loves company...

[Verse 1]
Drop a couple tears over these written words
Destined for greatness ever since the day I was given birth
Born with a curse but I'm just tryna convince the earth
Every time I did something wrong, I had no intent to hurt
I spit the words of crown men, walk with my head high, through towns end, came to preach the heart of thousands
Here's the announcement
"Phora's in the house, everybody circles around him, speakin' with the depth of the sea, height of a mountain
And they doubt it until they realize his vision was the truest, realize no other indviual could do this"
Gimmie a pen and I'mma use it in a fashion and nobody else can fool with, making more than music is a mothafuckin' movement
Pullin' nothin' but the truest, leavin' mothafuckas clueless, so let's knuckle up and do this
All the kids that hate me, they need to cuddle up and group kiss They said I'll never make it, so I'll struggle just to prove it

[Hook]
Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous
It's hard to show my love, cause growin' up I never felt it
Misery loves company
So darling take my hand please come with me
Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous
It's hard to show my love, cause growin' up I never felt it
Misery loves company
So darling take my hand please come with me, come with me

[Interlude: 2Pac - Speech to Malcolm X Grassroots Movement]
(...) it’s still on. It’s on just like it was when you were young. And you want to say “fuck that” just like you said “fuck that” back then. So how come now that I’m 20 years old, ready to start some shit up, everybody’s telling me to calm down. You know, don’t curse, go to school, go to college...well, fuck that. We’ve had colleges for a while now, now i'm saying, and there’re still Brenda’s out there, and nigga’s is still trapped. And it gets me irked, because I understand that it’s not gonna stop. It’s not gonna stop until we stop it

[Verse 2]
Keep your enemies the closest
The thing is that they were, but I was too blind to notice
Tryna send a message, give a fuck about the showbiz
My father use to give the cold shoulder to his own kids
That's probably why I'm so upset they tryna make me go to rest
But you'll never see me sleep cause its to close to death
Coke and meth in my fathers blood stream when he made me, born in 94' just another crack baby
From another black lady and my motha can't tame me, no father figure so you fuckas can't blame me
Learn to get used to it, ain't that crazy?
The street lights and the train tracks raised me nigga

[Hook]
Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous
It's hard to show my love, cause growin' up I never felt it
Misery loves company
So darling take my hand please come with me
Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous
It's hard to show my love, cause growin' up I never felt it
Misery loves company
So darling take my hand please come with me, come with me
