[Verse 1: Phora]
I'm just trying to seek my destiny
Y'all desperately trying to conduct the death of me
Thinking 'bout everything, every word, every dream
Anything that was said to me that ever meant a thing
I know it's meant to be, so let me be
But don't forget that we got the fucking keys to the game
Yours Truly as I sign my life to Jesus's name
In the day you see me smile is when I'm bleeding in pain
Food for thought, eat my words, shit, I'm feeding your brain
Have the fury of a hopeless man with speed in his veins
Left y'all speechless again, now y'all screaming my name
Y'all just speaking in vain cause y'all niggas weak in the brain
So give me a reason to stay, if not, then I'll be on my way
I'm still thinking of ways of keeping these demons away
But it's hard to keep 'em away when you don't believe what you say
And you can't trust yourself and your own hands hurt you
Patience is a virtue, so I'm breaking all my curfews
And they hating, they deserve to
They earned the right to hate me
Cause what I've been doing lately drives most of these niggas crazy
And this is only the beginning
Good riddance to these niggas, think I'm kidding?
Think again motherfucker

[Verse 2: Good Grades]
I be up and down the street, dropping off them G's
Twenty over here, twenty over there
Fifty over here, fifty over there
Really never thinking of the consequence
But what's a man to do?
When they see you and all they see is fucking F's
Ah shit, now I get no cheque?
Boss bugging on my fucking background check
Pops telling me, "Boy you ain't manning up yet?"
Pushing on some bud just to go and get a buck
I'm feeling like, "Fuck, man I'm feeling so stuck."
And I ain't even puffing on a fat blunt
So for that fast buck, I go and push my luck
Even when I get it, I'm still thinking, "Dog, I ain't got enough."
I got the game locked, yeah in some cuffs
But we ain't fooling around with them little punks
Now for that dollar, best believe we on the fucking hunt
Only to get that shit and go and use it up
This money means nothing, not a thing to us
So if y'all think it does, just think again
Yeah, just think again
