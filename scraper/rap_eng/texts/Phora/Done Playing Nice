[Verse]
Fuck all that humble shit
I'm more on the run and shit, aye
I know why they hate the kid
'Cause shawty she love this shit
I put in overtime all the time
Working triple-double shifts
Y'all on some funny shit, haha
Y'all on some funny shit
Aye, 2018 had to put a rapper back up in his place (Aye, yeah)
Came from the bank, I just made deposits I don't ever chase (Uh, yeah)
Yeah, all for the family I've been over here just making sure they straight (Uh, look)
Shoutout to pinch (Aye)
Why the fuck would I wait? (Fuck would I wait)
But I came from the bottom, I cannot forget
All of them times they told us not to flex
2011 sleepin' on the floor
2018 I'm hoppin' on a jet
I never seen these niggas as a threat
I pray to God he always say I'm blessed
I never seen these niggas as a threat
I pray to God he always say I'm blessed
Always say I'm blessed

[Chorus]

Done playing nice (Aye)
I ain't taking no advice (Aye)

Done playing nice (Yeah, yeah)

Done playing nice (Uh, yeah)
Done playing nice (Aye, aye, aye, look)
