So what the fuck am I afraid of
Dirty ass Chuck's how I came up
Me, I never changed for the money but it's funny how when a nigga get dollars man they change up
My niggas way up, yeah we stay up

So if they ain't fucking with these frontin' ass rappers no more Well I guess you can blame us!
So really what should I fear

I don't need these motherfuckers up in my ear Cause everybody always ask me how the fuck am I here but
Really I ain't surprised I been killing shit dawg

Everybody hating talking bout me on Twitter
When they come around I see the bitch in their eyes

[Verse 2]
To everybody saying we would never make it
Fuck'em all this shit for my day ones
See I ain't fucking with y'all
Just last year I wasn't nothing to y'all
I was going through the worst, got shot in the head Motherfuckers couldn't even pick up when I called, shit
But now you need a favor that's funny I wouldn't work with you even if you had the money
You was in the club poppin' bottles trynna flex, got home Eating steak while we all stayed hungry
Dreamin' of things we couldn't afford
They was in a foreign, I was pushing a Ford
Didn't have a dollar shit I came up poor
And they was calling cops on me I was trynna record
But I still made it possible
So ask yourself what's stopping you
Stay true to yourself
Never let nobody talk down when they talk to you

[Outro]
What the fuck am I afraid of
Should've seen how a young nigga came up
So what the fuck am I afraid of
Aye, straight from the bottom yeah I had to make a way up Like what the fuck am I afraid of
Should've seen how a young nigga came up
So what the fuck am I afraid of
Aye, straight from the bottom yeah I had to make a way up Way up, should've seen how a young nigga came up
