[Intro]
This track right here, is for the one
Not the ones that think they the ones
But this is for the one, that knows she's the one
& those ones that think they the one might think this the one about the one
But this is the one about the one that knows she's the one

[Verse 1]
Authenticity lives deep within the words
Dreamin' of the sky, & she's sleeping with the birds
& when she wakes up, she's prettier than ever, she don't ever need no make up
Every single night we conversate ,& we stay up 6 hours talking on the phone
It assures me when I look into your eyes I'm not alone
She's ain't trippin' on no facebook statues, or which girl that is
She trust me & I never ever dare to take advantage
Grab me by my hand & she asked me if I knew Spanish
& I told her Si, poquito mi amor. I'm not your average
Not just my lover,you're my bestfriend
My pride & joy & I will never treat you less than
We both got a past but don't let it ruin our future
That beautiful voice is something I'm willing to get used to
I mean, I ain't the type to have theses girls on the side
Better yet, I'm the type to keep that girl by my side

[Chorus]
She said "I love you to the moon & back"
& I replied, with a smile, "I love you too, in fact."
I have trust in me & you, baby don't ruin that
So , if I gave you my heart what would you do with that?
She said "I love you to the moon & back"
& I replied, with a smile, "I love you too, in fact."
[I have trust in me & you, baby don't ruin that]
So , if I gave you my heart what would you do with that?

[Verse 2]
What would you do if I gave you my heart?
Would you treat it with care or would you break it apart?
& I know you got your guard up, you're just playing it smart
Cause you dealt with to many niggas just playing a part
I appreciate all the times you were there for me
Every time I stressed out & we talked it's like therapy
You take the pain away with nothing but a sentence
So I'm wishing that this conversation's endless
But if not, let's make it last. Even when it's hard to smile you make me laugh
Every time I fucked up, you had the love to take me back
Look, I know it's crazy but I think you're the one
Got me thinking commitment, even raising a son hah
You know I'm playing wit you girl, don't get excited
I mean any thing's possible just depends on the timing
So tell me when you're ready girl, I'll wait 'til the start
& think about what you would do if I gave you my heart

[Chorus]
She said "I love you to the moon & back"
& I replied, with a smile, "I love you too, in fact."
I have trust in me & you, baby don't ruin that
So , if I gave you my heart what would you do with that?
She said "I love you to the moon & back"
& I replied, with a smile, "I love you too, in fact."
I have trust in me & you, baby don't ruin that
So , if I gave you my heart what would you do with that?
