WE ON THE GRIND LIKE, LIKE
ALL DAY NIGGA, YEAH
WE ON THE GRIND, GRIND, GRIND
LIKE ALL DAY NIGGA

[VERSE 1:]
AYO, I'm ON MY TOES, LIKE 2,4,7!
IF I'm NOT ROCKING THE MIC, IM PAYING THE HEAVEN
STAY ON MY GRIND LIKE TRUCKS ON THE CURB
TOO BUSY ON MY GRIZZY NIGGA FUCK WHAT U HEARD
NEVER SEEN A MAN LOSE HOES, CHASIN' MONEY
BUT I SEEN A MAN LOSE MAD DOUGH CHASING HONEYS
REAL SPIT, I RATHER GET PAYED DELAYED
GIRLS IS DRAMA, AND I AIN'T CAPTAIN SAVE THE DAY
I LET YOU KNOW, ONE THING IS FO' SURE
I GOT HEART LIKE SNOOP GOT TREES TO BLOW
SO IF YOU COME HALF STEPPIN', YOU NEED TO GO
CAUSE WE CHILLIN' AND MY FAM GOT WEED TO ROLL


SUNSET SO BEAUTIFUL
SHE SAID WHAT YOU WANNA DO? I SAID THE USUAL

SUNSET SO BEAUTIFUL
SHE SAID WHAT YOU WANNA DO? I SAID THE, HUH

WE ON THE GRIND LIKE, LIKE
ALL DAY NIGGA, YEAH
WE ON THE GRIND, GRIND, GRIND
LIKE ALL DAY NIGGA
