[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I mean it's crazy how everything changes so fast
Mm

[Chorus]
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
I just been takin' my time
Can't nobody take from my shine
I just wanna have love in my soul
I don't want no more tears in my eyes
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now

[Verse]
(I like it when she talk that)
(I'm from PCH with the top back)
Yeah, every time I wake up, thank the lord for the day
Thankful for the blessings that's comin' my way
Thankful for my family they give me the strength
I'm in need of good energy findin' my place
I ain't got time for the talk and I ain't got time for the fake
Workin' through the day ain't got time for no breaks
It's funny everybody got somethin' to say
But I could never let no one get in the way, no
She know how I like it when she talk that
I'm from PCH with the top back
Heard a couple things that they sayin' but
My whole team really with it if you want that
Want that, you don't want that
Fuck is you saying, you don't want that
Oh yeah, oh yeah
She know how I like it when she talk that (ay, ay, ay, ay)
They wasn't fuckin' with me back then (hmm, mm)
It's all different now

[Chorus]
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
I just been takin' my time
Can't nobody take from my shine
I just wanna have love in my soul
I don't want no more tears in my eyes
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
Yeah, they ain't love me back then but they fuck with me now
