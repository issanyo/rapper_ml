[Chorus: Breana Marin & Phora]
I'm trying not to think about you
I know I gotta make my own moves
I wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you
I wanna give you your space
I wanna give you your space
I wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you
I wanna give you your space
Yeah, wanna give you your space
I'm just tryna give you your space
Wanna give you your space, yeah

[Verse: Phora]
Lately I've just been thinking of giving you space
It's like nothing's really fitting in place
Memories, they fade, but they never erase
Guess my biggest fear is being replaced
Look, couldn't find what was missing
I had to keep a distance
Liquor still in my system, sipping the pain, gripping
I'm subtracting the negatives, now I feel the difference
But somehow I still feel lonely, I'm probably tripping, fuck
Feelings I never show
What comes out through the pain? I guess you'll never know
Say you need time alone, fuck it, I get it though
I'm just stuck between holding on and letting go
Yeah, guess we need to work on ourselves more
You the only one that I'm down for
You an angel I'm willing to go through hell for, look
But now I'm trying not to think about you

[Chorus: Breana Marin & Phora]
I'm trying not to think about you
I know I gotta make my own moves
I wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you
I wanna give you your space
I wanna give you your space
I wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you
I wanna give you your space
Yeah, wanna give you your space
I'm just tryna give you your space
Wanna give you your space, yeah

[Bridge: Phora]
Lately I've just been thinking of giving you space
It's like nothing's really fitting in place
Memories, they fade, but they never erase
Nah, they never erase
Lately I've just been thinking of giving you space
It's like nothings really fitting in place
Memories, they fade, but they never erase
Nah, they never erase

[Chorus: Breana Marin]
I'm trying not to think about you
I know I gotta make my own moves
I wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you
I wanna give you your space
I wanna give you your space
I wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you
I wanna give you your space
