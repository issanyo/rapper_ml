[Intro: Phora]
One, two, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, look

[Verse 1: Phora]
First I lost you, now I’m lost in the drugs
Pop this, take that ‘til I feel numb
All I ever wanted was to be yours
All I ever wanted was to feel love
But I’m six pills in and I feel fine
Can’t stop thinking ‘bout when you were still mine
I just don’t know what to do now
Guess I’ll take another one just to kill time
Can’t feel my face and I can't move
But they say you can’t love what you can’t lose
So I’m sitting here trapped in my own thoughts
Now I can’t feel all ‘cause of you
You ever so lost that you feel alone?
You ever scared to end up on your own?
You ever get hurt 'til you can’t feel?
I ain’t never had a place I can call home

[Bridge: Phora]
I ain’t never had nobody I could run to
I ain’t never had a home I could come to
I ain’t ever have nobody really love me
And that’s probably why I don’t know how to love you
I ain’t never had nobody I could run to
I ain’t never had a home I could come to
I ain’t ever have nobody really love me
And that’s probably why I don’t know how to love you

[Verse 2: Phora]
Uh, yeah, but it’s really hard to think about you
Can’t breathe, can’t eat, can’t sleep without you, uh
And they all say I lost myself tryna find you
But I’m not me without you, look
I don’t want to go through it no more
I don’t want to do it no more
I just took all these pills
Fuck love, fuck life, I can’t do it no more
Think I’m fading out
Please don’t let go ‘cause I’m fading out
Please don’t let me go ‘cause I’m fading out
Please don’t let go ‘cause I’m fading out

[Outro: Breana Marin]
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Doing everything I can to feel something
‘Cause everything I do feels like nothing
Don’t know what to think
Don’t know how to move
‘Cause I don’t really make sense without you
Doing everything I can to feel something
‘Cause everything I do feels like nothing
Don’t know what to think
Don’t know how to move
‘Cause I don’t really make sense without you
I don’t really make sense without you
