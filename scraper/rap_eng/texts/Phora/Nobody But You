[Verse 1]
We've been looking for love in a world full of hate
Tell me what's it take, to find somebody true
Find somebody real, I don't need the fake
And I don't need the lies, but the truth hurts
Now a days I need proof first
I told her:
"Baby we can fall in love but just make sure you love you first"
I'm done falling for the wrong ones
I need someone for the long-run
I need someone that I know is down to ride for me when this shit is all done
She gave her love and her passion to me
Told me that she always had it for me
I never thought falling for someone would happen to me but

[Chorus]
You was all that ever mattered to me
I never thought I'd fall in love, girl
Never thought that shit would ever happen to me
If I had to tell the truth girl, really you was all that ever mattered to me
I never thought I'd fall in love, girl
Never thought that shit would ever happen to me
I don't want nobody else but you girl tell me is you down to make it happen with me

[Verse 2]
When is love, not lust you gon' feel the difference
Stay close when you feel the distance
And all the times you thought you found love
You would still feel something's missing
I'm riding with you in the rain
You know I'm with you through the pain
I knew you needed something different
Until you met me, all these niggas was the same
But girl you be driving me crazy
Rather be driving Mercedes
I know there's been times that you hate me
But can nobody else replace me?
Baby tell me can I talk to you?
All these girls I cut them off for you
Your time, love and your persistance, all a nigga needed
All a nigga want from you
And no one's ever gonna change that
Me and you can take it way back
You give a certain type of love to me
What I feel I can never replace that
She gave her love and her passion to me
Told me that she always had it for me
I never thought falling for someone would happen to me but

[Chorus]
You was all that ever mattered to me
I never thought I'd fall in love, girl
Never thought that shit would ever happen to me
If I had to tell the truth girl
Really you was all that ever mattered to me
I never thought I'd fall in love, girl
Never thought that shit would ever happen to me
I don't want nobody else
But you girl tell me is you down to make it happen with me
