Verse 1:
Last night I tried to call you, but I ain't get no answer
I tried to call again, & sent a text two minutes after
& it kinda drives me crazy, cause I know you see me calling you
Giving me the silent treatment, I just wanna talk to you
I know I'm not perfect, & I hurt you before
But I can't help the situation if I'm getting ignored
What happened to us and the love we used to have for each other?
Road trips, and the plans with each other
I guess their gone, already made your decision
But aye, the more I tried the more you drifted away
& It was probably never you intention to stay
& knowing that, it's hard to get through my day
Constantly on my mind, Im always thinking on what we coulda been
Hate all the mistakes I made, I dwell on what I shoudla did
I bet that you regret the very day that you found me
You'd honestly probably do better without me

Hook(x2):
But I'm trynna give you all the happiness that's left in me
Although it isn't much, nah it isn't much
& with that said thank you for the memories
Guess that's the end of us, yeah that's the end of us

Verse 2:
Look, I just wish that we could set our pride to the side
But I'm too stubborn yo I tried & I tried
Maybe I just didn't give you enough of my time
Or maybe I was just getting to outta line
But either way I take the blame for the mistakes I made
Scarred from the past & our memories are razor blades
& your voice is like a 4-5 to my dome piece
The very day you left I started drinking with the homies
Cause I got no where to run to, no where to pour my feelings out
So I keep em bottled up inside until I spill em out
& I can be there for you, to kiss you & hug you
But the worst part is that you said you never felt like I loved you

Hook(x2):
But I'm trynna give you all the happiness that's left in me
Although it isn't much, nah it isn't much
& with that said thank you for the memories
Guess that's the end of us, yeah that's the end of us
