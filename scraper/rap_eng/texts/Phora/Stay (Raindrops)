[Verse 1]
I know it's getting late, but you should stay awhile
Got a couple things that me and you should conversate about
Really happy so I find it kinda crazy how
Saw the little things you do for me that
Always make me smile
It might take awhile for you to understand my ways
Make the days count never count the days
You don't have to leave baby you can crash with me
It's cold, plus it's raining out so tell me if you plan to stay
All the others before you never meant shit to me, they history
And don't even deserve to be a memory
You're the voice to my soul is solid as concrete
The flow to my bloodstream, the drums to my heart beat

[Hook]
Tell me what's on your mind girl, I hope it's me
Look straight into my eyes girl, what do you see?
I wanna show you how I feel like I think I can explain it now
So baby tell me what's the deal ya can you stay awhile?

[Verse 2]
Look, Wanna show you I'm different baby and I can prove it
Cause when I dedicate myself I put my life into it
And I wanna take you to places you've never been
Show you things you've never seen, hope you find yourself a thing
And I'll give you my heart if you want it
I say you take a chance cause tomorrow ain't promised
And to be honest, It's all up to you
We can show each other off and show them all how we do
But forget about them niggas that you've dealt with in the past
I made a promise to myself it's gonna last
Ima gonna treat you like a queen, deserved to be treated like
Just give it some time and I'll be sure you can sleep at night
Knowing you got a man that, loves and appreciates you
But just don't be too surprised when all these females hate you
But the clock is ticking, tell me before your times up
You gonna stay awhile? Baby make your mind up

[Hook]
Tell me what's on your mind girl, I hope it's me
Look straight into my eyes girl what do you see?
I wanna show you how I feel like I think I can explain it now
So baby tell me what's the deal ya can you stay awhile?
