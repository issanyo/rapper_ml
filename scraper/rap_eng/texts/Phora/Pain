Verse 1:
Although I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no man but God as I take my last breath
Used to beg them to stay and they'd just ask me to leave
You dont know what strugglin means until they shatter your dreams
Keep moving, no matter if them fuckers wanna doubt you nigga
Never been fed with a silver spoon, what about you nigga?
From the craddle to my motherfuckin' grave bitch
Heard my momma cryin' homie, I ain't been the same since
Blue skies turnin' white, theirs blood on the pavement
And all they ever ask me is "Phora how did you make it?"
Not "where did you come from?" or "tell me your story"
Theirs a difference between cats who want something from and for me
But I ain't trippin, they tellin me to settle down
Aha but i ain't settlin' for nothin'
And the people i hung around would just let me down
Eventually I was the only one i trusted
Real talk, I try not to show emotion
Alot of shit inside me i won't put out in the open
I hope i never snap, Lord knows that im destined for greatness
But those niggas keep testin my patience, I got

Chorus:
Pain in my heart, tryna not to let it show
They ask me if Im ready, I never said no way
But you really never know(x2)

Verse 2:
I just close my eyes and imagine
And just try to fly away
Aiming for tomorrow but we dying by the day
Ill be the first one to say i cry I ain't ashamed
They keep tellin me to smile but yo im tryna find a way
Losing touch to myself tears droppin to the pavement
Honestly I dont know how much longer i can take it
And I know how it feels to lose all everyone that you love
And start questiong the one up above
Like why do all the good people gotta die
And why these young kids victim to a homicide
I dont know but im still searchin for the answers
Haven't smoked since my grandfather died from cancer
So dont take offense when I dont hit the blunt with you
Cause theirs a reason, it dont mean that I dont fuck wit you
All It means is that you dont know what Im going through
Dont ask to talk about it, its not something that im open to
Behind every smile is a number of tears, told myself that i have nothing to fear
But little did i know when you keep all that pain inside
You'll be your own worst enemy til the day you die

Chorus:
Pain in my heart, tryna not to let it show
They ask me if Im ready, I never said no way
But you really never know(x2)
