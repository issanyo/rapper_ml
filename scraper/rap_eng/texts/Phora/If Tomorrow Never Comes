[Verse 1: The Hics]
Time to kill the lights
Erase the line
To distance your soul from mine
Search for the divine to find your soul
The soul that encaptured mine

[Verse 2: PHORA]
Yeah, we're so far, we're so far from home
I don't know where we are, we're just all alone
But I've been trying to find myself
Yeah, I've been trying to find myself
But I'm so lost, I can't sleep
I'm so gone baby, I can't think
But at the same time, I've been trying to find myself
Yeah, I've been trying to find myself
But I'm so lost

[Verse 3: Eskupe]
