[Intro: Phora]
Yeah, sometimes I just miss the way she used to be

[Chorus: Phora]
You should love me like way back then
Yeah I'm talking ’bout way back then
We ain't had stress so much
It was all ok back then
Way back then (Yeah)
It was all ok back then (Yeah)
You should love me like way back then
Yeah I'm talking ’bout way back then
We ain't had stress so much
It was all ok back then (Yeah)
Way back then (Yeah)
It was all ok back then

[Verse 1: Phora]
Yeah, you should love me like, yeah
Love me like way back when
Never pay attention to the talk
You should know we ain't like them
I love you in a hoodie or a dress
I love you in a Chevy or a Benz
I love you like no one else
Even though she was different back then
I still love you like Barack love Michelle
Wanna know how you feel can't tell
Don't wanna do this myself
'Cause I used to think of love like hell
Then I met you, then I met you
Where did time go, no clue
Telling me you need me now like you did back then
But it's funny 'cause I need you too
Yeah I need you too

[Pre-Chorus: Breana Marin]
I need you, I need you, I need you too
Love me the way you, the way you used too
Lately I’ve been feeling like I miss you, miss you

[Chorus: Phora & (Breana Marin)]
You should love me like way back then
Yeah I’m talking 'bout way back then
We ain’t had to stress so much
It was all ok back then (Back then)
Way back then (Back then)
It was all ok back then, yeah (Back then)
You should love me like way back then
Yeah I'm talking 'bout way back then
We ain't had to stress so much
It was all ok back then (Back then)
Way back then (Back then)
It was all ok back then, yeah (Back then)
You should love me like

[Post-Chorus: Breana Marin]
I need you, I need you, I need you too
Love me the way you, the way you used too
Lately I’ve been feeling like I miss you, miss you

[Outro: Phora]
I've been so distant I know
I just need somewhere to go
I just need you, I'm sick of being alone
Can't do this shit on my own
I've been so distant I know
I just need somewhere to go
I just need you, I'm sick of being alone
Can't do this shit on my-
