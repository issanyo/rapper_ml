[Intro: Scarface]
I never fucked anybody over in my life who didn't have it coming to them
All I have in this world is my balls and my word
And I don't break em' for no one
What you think I am, huh?
What you think I'mma fucking worm like you
I told you buddy, I told you, don't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Phora]
How you call your people family, but you ain't got no loyalty
How you say you feed your peeps, but you keep all the royalties
And never break bread with a nigga, bled with a nigga
Remember what I said to you now, I'm dead to you niggas
Smith and Wesson aimed at my head, a clip full of bullets
All that talk about guns on my family you wouldn't pull it
Ain't got the balls to do it, yours truly bitch we the movement
Who's this motherfucker acting stupid talking like he ruthless
Foolish niggas got it twisted, you can't swim with the sharks
You better swim with the fishes, nigga just play your part
Play your position small soldier and if you were smart
You would quit and sit in the dark, I see the bitch in your heart
You missing the spark, me I got that fluid to your lighter
K. Dot drop the track now, you faggots sound like biters
You taking his style, you taking his flow
You even took the same beat and fucking named it control
You ain't original, nigga you ain't making no dough
I know you never heard a soul chant your name at a show
I know it hurts little bro, but I'm the one you could look up to
I'll show you how to rock the mic and make these ladies love you
You can be just like me G, just wait until your balls drop
Niggas all talk, they bout' as pussy as a mall cop
Coming for these rappers throats, you best protect your neck
Wannabe gangsters is throwing hoods, but never rep the set
Motherfuckers ain't a threat its YT to my death
We up next motherfuckers, steady repping the west
I'll be sure to stop you in your steps the second you test
Nevertheless, I always pay respect to the vest
Rest in peace Big and Pac, is there heaven for these rappers
I'm bound to murder them all, I already ordered their caskets
I'm laughing and niggas asking what happened, can you imagine
That last look up on they face, when I slay these cats with a passion
All that barking ain't scaring a nigga and I heard your last track
God damn that was embarrassing nigga
Yeah we, here for the taking, hip-hop's next generation
Y'all Motherfuckers better hide in your basement
Nigga we back
