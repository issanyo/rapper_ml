What you gonna do when you ain't got anymore friends
No more weed, money's all spent
After everything, all you got is you
So take care of yourself and do what you gotta do

[Verse 1]
Got two things in this world, that's my bars and my word
Never will they break, fors y'all look concerned
I care less about what you saw, what you heard
Fake friends, didn't need 'em, kicked em all to the curb
So I focus on me, myself, and my two feet
Tryin' to make better decisions and turn a new leaf
I'm still a kid, still lookin' for my purpose
Suffocated by the world, fightin for the surface
Ghaspin' for that breath of fresh air called survival
Hopin' that I make it, both hands on the Bible
Searchin' for an explanation deeper than life
Too many thoughts up in my mind so I ain't sleepin at night
Thinkin' 'bout, if I was gone, would they give a fuck
Sometimes I don't feel like livin' but I ain't givin' up
I tell myself, keep breathin' and get through the day
So if you feelin down, I encourage you to do the same
Cause this cold world's only gettin colder
Time never stops, so we only gettin older
Each day I live, I try to make the best of it
Guess it's up to me but it's hard not to be a pessimist
And all this negativity is clouding my focus
I just look the other way and never doubt my emotions
I stay down to earth instead of down on the focus
I'm that air that you breathe, look around and you'll notice
I'm the voice of the people, gave 'em part of my soul
Every day I live through only makes it harder to grow
Cause I've seen so much tragedy and hatred
Bet none of these friends will be glad to see me make it
But I remember who loved me before the fans and the fame
On one hand, I can count you the names
Look, I remember who loved me before the fans and the fame
On one hand, I can count you the names

What you gonna do when you ain't got anymore friends
No more weed, money's all spent
After everything, all you got is you
So take care of yourself and do what you gotta do
What you gonna do when you ain't got anymore friends
No more weed, money's all spent
After everything, all you got is you
So take care of yourself and do what you gotta do
What you gonna do when you ain't got anymore friends
No more weed, money's all spent
After everything, all you got is you
So take care of yourself and do what you gotta do

[Verse 2]
Yo, before this shit I never had a best friend
Never had a girl that told me she was down till the end
Actin' like they love me, but don't understand my misery
None of y'all ever tried to write to me or visit me when I was locked away and needed a shoulder to lean on
Taught me all I got is me, and I just need to be strong
My so-called friends left me in the dust
Till this very day they're still textin' me, "What's up?"
Nobody gave a fuck about my ass a couple years back
So don't be surprised when you call and don't hear back
Don't take it personal, I'm just handling business
Separate myself from the snakes and scandalous bitches
Cause I don't trust a soul and never do I fuck with hoes
Cause most of the katts around me in it for the money, yo
I ain't gonna lie, get paid and I want some more but the difference is I'm on my shit, they just want a short cut
But that's only gonna get you cut short
Opportunity is knockin', it's at your front door
So, what you gonna do?
Take it and make a move or depend on others to put some food on a plate for you
When shit hits the fan and you can't find a way to quit stressin'
Everyone you know will leave you in a split second
So many friends turned on me for a couple dollars
But that's why I stand alone and only trust my momma
Cause when I'm at my worst, nobody knows me
But when I'm doin good everyone's my fuckin homie

[Bridge]
Don't blame me for takin care of myself homie. I ain't selfish, I'm just gettin what I deserve, you know? I worked hard for this shit. I never took no handouts, never asked y'all for nothin homie

What you gonna do when you ain't got anymore friends
