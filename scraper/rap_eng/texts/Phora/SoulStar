[Verse 1]
Yo, So Dont Be Afraid To Go And Show Your Smile Off
I Know I Been Busy But Girl I Took A While Off
Just So I Can See How You Doing And Spend Some Time Witcha
Just Wanna Conversate And See Whats Going On Witcha
You Know Just Talkin Bout Life And Reminisce
About The First Time We Met And Our First Kiss
Everything We Went Through That Help Me To Grow
See I Been Missing You Like Crazy
I Just Want You To Know
Where Ever You Go, Where Ever You Are
Even If Im Not Around Girl Just Know Your A Star
Not Star As In Celebrity But As In The One That Shines Down From The Sky Cause Your Smile's So Heavenly
See I Just Want You Next To Me
Right Here, Right Now
Love Your Curves But MOst Of All I Love Where You At Mentally
I Wanna Show The World How Beautiful Your Mind Is
So Dont Be Afraid To Show Them How You Shine Miss

[Verse 2]
One Love To All My Single Moms Holding it Down
Yeah I Remember As A Kid Moms Was Always Around
She Was Always There When I Needed Sumin'
Till This Very Day She Still Is
Strong Women, She Dont Need A Husband
Times Wasn't Always So Bad
Cause We Made Life Work Outta The Little We Had
We Came A Long Way, But We Still Got So Far To Go
And Momma Knows Its Been Tough Since We Started Yo
And This Life Will Probably Never Be Easy
And If I Told You What We've Been Through You'd Probably Never Believe Me
My Whole Family Got Stories For Days, I Can Only Explain How Much I Love Them All In So Many Ways
I Told My Grandma And Grandpa,Well I Made A Song Without Cursing
Hope I Get The Chance To Show You In Person
Cause I Drive Around The World And Back
Just To See That Smile Of Yours
Thats Summin' Money Can Never Afford
Yours Truly
