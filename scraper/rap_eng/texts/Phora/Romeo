[Verse 1: Brandon Vlad]
She Bonnie but I'm not Clyde
I'm more like the guy on the side (Oh, oh)
She delete my text at night
'Cause she said he's gone can you slide (Oh)
If you don't wanna love me for long, baby girl leave me alone
I told you house ain't a home
I don't drink I'd be acting a fool
When I smoke I don't pass it to you

[Chorus: Brandon Vlad]
Who are you with when you're not with me?
Where are your lips when you're not kissing me?
It's like when I talk you don't listen to me
Since school started you're distant from me
I guess I'll go 'til you come my way
Then you make me fold
Hopeless, he goes
Pobrecito
Get to Capulet
Long live Romeo

[Verse 2: Phora]
Yeah, last night you got wasted
Know you do it all for attention
You don't want me on your timeline
And, I don't want you in my mentions, yeah
You act like your shit smells like roses
You always put me second
So now, off the Hennessy acting a fool, realize I'll never be happy with you
I just can't be happy with you, fuck
Done with your arguments, I'm done with you selfish ways
Done trying to argue with you, that doesn't get me paid
Don't come back when you're lonely
Don't come back running to me

[Chorus: Brandon Vlad]
Who are you with when you're not with me?
Where are your lips when you're not kissing me?
It's like when I talk you don't listen to me
Since school started your distant from me
I guess I'll go 'til you come my way
Then you make me fall
Hopeless, he goes
Pobrecito
Get to Capulet
Long live Romeo
