[Hook]
Yeah, baby girl, come thru
I'm tryna see what's up with you
You can be the one, don't mind being stuck with you
You can fly away, just might  fall in love with you
Just might  fall in love with you
Baby girl, come thru
I'm tryna see what's up with you
You can be the one, don't mind being stuck with you
You can fly away, just might  fall in love with you
Just might  fall in love with you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never met a girl like you
Ain't nobody in this world like you
I ain't never seen nobody else shine like a diamond or a pearl like you (uh)
I just wanna love you down (aye)
I just wanna make you smile (yeah)
I just wanna make you laugh
Wanna make you come
Wanna make you proud (aye)
I just been too scared to open up
I push away if I'm close enough
Both of us broken and both of us scared
But I'm letting you know you're the only one
I would never break my promise
I ain't felt love in the longest
Look, I just can't move too fast
Still numb from the past just got to be honest (yeah)
So many feelings I never show
You got me thinking I'm ready tho
You got me thinking about you like twenty-four seven
Just don't ever let me go (uh)
Momma taught me never follow trends, just follow hearts
So Ima make sure that you fall in love and never fall apart
Look

[Hook]
Baby girl, come thru
I'm tryna see what's up with you
You can be the one, don't mind being stuck with you
You can fly away, just might fall in love with you
Just might fall in love with you
Baby girl, come thru
I'm tryna see what's up with you
You can be the one, don't mind being stuck with you
You can fly away, just might fall in love with you
Just might fall in love with you

[Outro]
Yeah, I don't want to love too soon
I don't wanna trust too fast
I just wanna put you first
I just wanna make this last
Look, I don't want to love too soon
I don't wanna trust too fast
I just wanna put you first
Baby, we can make this last
