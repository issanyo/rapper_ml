Yeah, I said I gotta stay motivated
Gotta stay focused
Heard these niggas always hating
Hardly ever notice
Cuz I've been on my grind
24/7 to the 65
Yeah it gets so alive
These niggas acting real surprised
But to me this ain't to strange
Yall chasing opportunities
Chasing the pootang
Guess that's how it is
See, I've been about my biz
Ever since I've used to rock
Them fake laces for shoe strings
Yall got it twisted, man
Yall need to listen man
Words from the wise
Don't post your money up on Instagram
Cuz niggas got daughters to feed
And there ain't no job
So they jack somebody like you
Like it's no problem, shit
I wish it was different
But the world keeps turning
Even though you ain't living
He wrote a letter to his son
Saying, he wish he could visit
He just wants a 2nd chance
But he'll never gonna get it
Cuz he got 97 years
No chance of parole
No chance of feeling what it's like to be glad to be home
The Da said it'll be forgotten
When he pass away
Never kissed his mother
Never seen his son graduate
Now, if you ever saw this man
You'll see the hatred in him
But what they don't see
Is a certain place within him
A place in his heart
Where his son still cares
His mother's still there
What keeps him going is the motivation
