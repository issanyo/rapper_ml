[Pre-Chorus]
Holding on doesn’t feel the same
Nothing seems to cover up the pain
Baby, I’ve been trying but you can't feel the same
About me, baby

[Chorus]
Baby I’ve been trying, nothing seems to cover up the pain
I’ve been trying, holding on, holding on
Baby I’ve been trying, nothing seems to cover up the pain
I’ve been trying, holding on, holding on

[Verse]
Yeah, I’ve just been so numb, it feels like nothing’s real
I’ve just been so empty, I can’t fuckin’ feel
But I can feel my body start to fade
My heart is cold that’s why I’m so sick of taking all these fuckin’ pills
I don’t ever talk about it much
Drinking every day, just to escape the memories of us
You paint me as a villain, but my blood is on your brush
I was in it 'til the end, you was in it for the rush
See I’m scared of being hurt and I’m scared of getting close
'Cause the closest people to you are the ones that hurt you most
But it's hard to know your worth when everything is broke
Now I’m just drowning in my sorrow trying not to fuckin' choke
The more pain you go through, the harder it feel
And the scars that we can’t see are the hardest to heal
I gave you everything, I’m just left with all of these pills
And even though I fuckin' hate you, you have part of me still
Cry for you, I promised that I'd never fuckin' cry for you
Die for you, I can’t be without you, I would die for you
Bleed for you, I do anything, I fuckin' bleed for you
Why can’t you understand? I fuckin' needed you

[Pre-Chorus]
Holding on doesn’t feel the same
Nothing seems to cover up the pain
Baby, I’ve been trying but you can't feel the same
About me, baby

[Chrous]
Baby I’ve been trying, nothing seems to cover up the pain
I’ve been trying, holding on, holding on
Baby I’ve been trying, nothing seems to cover up the pain
I’ve been trying, holding on, holding on

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Nothing seems to cover up the pain
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Nothing seems to cover up the pain
