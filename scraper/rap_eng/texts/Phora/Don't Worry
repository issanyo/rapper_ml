[Hook]
Dont worry if we fall
In love
We will never touch the ground

[Verse 1 : Hands]
Ain't no trouble in this world when shes around me
Im a mess but shes cleaning me up like bounty
Much sweeter than the oranges in this county
Darling can you feel the pressure of this love amounting
Seconds I be counting right before we take off
Faster than the speed of love so over the radar
Living with each other even though we kinda stay far
Some relationships run loops kinda like a race car
Butterflies will never die cause she identifies
Ever trouble that I got
And my love will never stop
Just like my heart beats
When we in between the sheets
And we in between the sheets just like The Isley's
Never touch around so dont be scared to care
This attraction is so pure no pollution in our air
We could go out and I win you something at the fair
No time to spare cause this loving is so rare

[Hook]
Dont worry if we fall
In love
We will never touch the ground
Dont worry if we fall
In love
We will never touch the ground

[Verse 2 : Phora]
Dont worry if we fall we'll never stop falling
And Girl if you got work today you're gunna have to call in
Cause me and you gon' have to chat a bit
Rose pedals on the dinner table with the candle lit
And if you need that I can handle it
Call me anytime and if im busy ill get back to it
Its like we're falling through the clouds or the heavens
You never get mad girl your smiles never ended
Catch you touching feelings from the vibes that you sending
I can tell you ain't like them others lying and pretending baby
I make mistakes girl im only human
But im hoping every dream I have is the dream I see you in
And if its not shit its okay long as I wake up next to you
And if I dont gotta say my day would sure be ruined
Look your the prettiest when your fresh out of the shower
No make up in pajamas & you hair tied in a towel
Time flies when im with you , seconds turn to hours
And me falling for you was so out of my power
But I can't help it guess it was just meant to be
And im selfish cause I know you were meant for me

[Hook]
Dont worry if we fall
In love
We will never touch the ground
Dont worry if we fall
In love
We will never touch the ground
Dont worry if we fall
In love
We will never touch the ground
