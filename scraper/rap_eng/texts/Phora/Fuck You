[Hook: Phora]
So fuck you, I'mma do it all myself
Never needed y'all for no help
You should watch them niggas around you
I can make it to the top with or without you

[Verse 1: Phora]
Look, I never had shit handed to me
I worked hard for this shit, your truly bitch, I started this shit
And that's until my fucking grave, I got it carved in my skin
They say the bigger the head, then the harder you slip
So I stay humble to the people who took part in this shit
And I swear on my mother's life, it's from the heart when I spit
Nah I never told a fable man, these other dudes is fairy tales
Trust me, all the cats you hear dissing me I know very well
But fuck the rap beef, I'll never diss a nigga back
Cause I got more important shit to cover in a track
Really half these niggas mad cause they can't get a feature from me
Trying to pay me for a verse, man you can keep your money
Cause I keep my circle small and work with who I trust
Never will I give a handout for a couple bucks
Homie I don't give a fuck, call me what you want to
Cause I've done heard it all, but never do y'all fall through
So fall back, I got a plan for myself
I went from nothing to something, never asked for no help
Look, so fall back, I got a plan for myself
I went from nothing to something, never asked for no help nigga

[Hook: Phora]
So fuck you, I'mma do it all myself
Never needed y'all for no help
You should watch them niggas around you
I can make it to the top with or without you

[Verse 2: Eskupe]
I won't stop till I'm immortalized, it's the Mexican oversize
Now the threat is organized, I got 'em all mortified
Y'all sick to your stomach, the stocks gon' plummet
They say they run these streets
But their fucking mouths the only thing they running
They say I should praise the sun, I feel like Satan's son
It's the illuminated one, let the bud invade your lungs
These weed sessions got me stressing, kind of depressing
Now I'm getting these bars off my chest like I was bench pressing
On a mission, the clock is ticking, no time for politician
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so I'm just getting what I'm getting
Got to formulate the plot, orchestrate the shots
Y'all better lick shots 'cause it's 'gon take more to make me stop
I got to formulate the plot, orchestrate the shots
Y'all better lick shots 'cause it's 'gon take more to make me stop

[Hook: Phora]
So fuck you, I'mma do it all myself
Never needed y'all for no help
You should watch them niggas around you
I can make it to the top with or without you
Fuck you, I'mma do it all myself
Never needed y'all for no help
You should watch them niggas around you
I can make it to the top with or without you
