[Intro]
Oh yeah, ah yeah, aye

[Pre-Chorus]
Buss it down, fuck around
Everybody switch but you stuck around (Aye)
Run it back, I'm still attached
I'll do anything just to get it back (Aye, aye)

[Chorus]
Trying to numb the pain with these drugs right now
I'm going insane for your love right now
Say you need some time but I won't back down
I need all your pain and your love right now
Trying to numb the pain with these drugs right now
I'm going insane for your love right now
Say you need some time but I won't back down
I need all your pain and your love right now

[Verse]
Aye, listen, you need something different
I know I ain't perfect, but I'm tryin' to fix it
Lately, I've been nervous, everybody switching
You need someone who gon' care for you when something's missing
Yeah, taking all these drugs trying to numb the pain
I don't wanna feel so I run away
I'm sick of the games I don't wanna play
'Cause I need someone there when I'm not ok
Ah yeah, I just need you in my bed
Thinking 'bout those things you said
When you not with me, you still in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, buss it down, fuck around
Everybody switch but you stuck around (Aye)
Run it back, I'm still attached (Still attached)
I'll do anything just to get it back (Aye, aye)

[Chorus]
Trying to numb the pain with these drugs right now
I'm going insane for your love right now
Say you need some time but I won't back down
I need all your pain and your love right now
Trying to numb the pain with these drugs right now
I'm going insane for your love right now
Say you need some time but I won't back down
I need all your pain and your love right now
