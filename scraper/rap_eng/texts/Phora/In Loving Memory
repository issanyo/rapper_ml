[Chorus]
Every day that i see the sunshine up in the sky
You running through my mind
And I'm wondering why
Why the devil didn't take me life
Why the devil didn't take me life
Every day that i see the sunshine up in the sky
You running through my  mind
And I'm wondering why
Why the devil didn't take my life
Why the devil didn't take me life

[Verse 1]
Like what i do so good & i swore i felt like praying
It didn't do no good as the devil laughed
And when you passed
I could of sworn i seen an angel
Running through your hood
Every since then im praying every day
That my feeling so stressed
I need to get away  will it ever stop?
Will it ever change ?
Probably not but im still prayin for better days
But i can't sleep i hear your laughing at night
& ill give everything in my life
To have you back ill give it all up
Girls money & fame
Because without you ain't nothing the same
Its sad to say it dont work like that
& you'd probably be proud of me
If you heard my raps
Its had to live hard to laugh and smile without you every now and then
I think of you  and right and wrong

[Chorus]
Every day that i see the sunshine up in the sky
You running through my mind
And I'm wondering why
Why the devil didn't take me life
Why the devil didn't take me life
Every day that i see the sunshine up in the sky
You running through my  mind
And I'm wondering why
Why the devil didn't take my life
Why the devil didn't take me life

[Verse 2]
I reminisce on the days
We were running from the police
Tagging on the bus late nights on these cold streets when i needed advice you were there
Why did they have to go and take your life
It isn't fair, now I feel like part of me is gone
But your memory lives on
Through the lyrics of this song
And its wrong the way you had to go
Loneliness is now the only friend i know
They say i think about it to much '
I just think i have to let it go
But ever since you went away
Its hard to make it on my own own
I hear a [?] despise the stress
But a palm me  i learned to utilize
The many things you taught me
I've learned to forgive and learned to love
When I think of you I know you smiling from above
I remember when we used to ditch school
Cause our teacher said it something
We would never get through
We was gone they never caught us in class today
And the sad thing is that neither
Of us got to graduate man i miss you
Im just trying to survive  ohh what id do
To have you come back to alive
This might sound selfish but i want you back home
Cause I need you
But you in a better place
And we get to meet soon
I want you back home cause i need you
But you in a better place and we gonna meet soon

[Chorus]
Every day that i see the sunshine up in the sky
You running through my mind
And I'm wondering why
Why the devil didn't take me life
Why the devil didn't take me life
Every day that i see the sunshine up in the sky
You running through my  mind
And I'm wondering why
Why the devil didn't take my life
Why the devil didn't take me life
