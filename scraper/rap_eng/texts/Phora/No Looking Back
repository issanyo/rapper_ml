[Verse 1]
Yeah
On a plane overlookin' the ocean
Lately, I'm just tryna live in the moment
Certain people I needed just couldn't stick around
If they ain't see the vision, I bet they feel it now
See, the difference with me is I ain't afraid of believin'
Friends only come around when they know it's convenient
But my circle gettin' smaller by the second
Funny how my biggest fear was not bein' accepted, but look
I gave my heart to a person who couldn't love herself
I'm lost in somebody lookin' for someone else
Put my trust in a person who ain't believe in me, eventually it just made it harder for me to trust myself

[Hook 1]
I leave the past in the past, no looking back now
But I ain't complacent with where I'm at now
So in hopes that somebody else could relate to me, I take another sip of this Henney and write these raps down

[Verse 2]
Anxiety killin' me, I've been losin' touch
Losin' my patience, I don't know who to trust
Plus, me and my family ain't as close now
I take a sip of this Henney until I loosen up
I just need someone as down for me
Someone to just tell me they proud of me
Somebody who's really around for me
If ever they see me sink in, they swim in and they drown for me
The ones hittin' my line used to duck me when I called
Keep it real with me or don't fuck with me at all
I've been dodgin' the fakes, the politics and the snakes
Your pride is big as your ego, see, I just couldn't relate, for real
See, the difference is how we're raised and where we came
And the bullet that landed three inches from my brain
And the fact that my soul is different than yours, no matter how many times they compare us, man, we are not the same
Look, prayin' for peace in this world that we live in
Same time, I just pray I'm forgiven
They say I'm weak 'cause I put it all in the open
Had to swallow my pride and bottle up my emotions, look

[Hook 2]
I left the past in the past, no looking back now
But I ain't complacent with where I'm at now
So in hopes that somebody else could relate to me, I take another sip of this Henney and write these raps down
