Ayo, I used to wanna be the toughest kid on the block
Till I found out the toughest kid always gets shot
I used to wanna make a mill pushin that rock
Till I found out the big timers always got caught
I used to wanna be the OG tellin a tale
Til I found out they only up dead or in jail
I was Lost and confused searchin for somebody to be
Till I realized that person I was searchin for was me

Look, as of right now I'm writing rhymes in this notebook
Scheming on making ways to make a mil, without giving my soul up
& Split it with the cats that had nothing but love to show us
In hopes that I never have to watch my nigga bag that coke up
Just to make a buck to put some food in his belly
I ain't worried about the rumors or the bullshit they tell me
Cause me & my niggas, yeah we tryna eat
We tryna get that, never sleep & never sit back
Talk is cheap so quit the chit chat
If you ain't got the flow you gotta go
If you & I suppose, you're gonna need a thousand up front for me to rock a show nigga
Tellin' you I'm bout my busy
I'm learnin' to forgive all the dirt that everyones did me
Simply cause I'm just tryna learn to love before they kill me
I don't do this for myself, this for everyone that's with me
I just wanna be remembered when my time is up
Not as a G, not as a thug, cause homie I ain't tough
Just remember me for everything I tried to tell you
Cause when I'm gone It'll make sense but I don't wanna fail you
So I try my best to try & stay alive
But it's hard when the cats that wanna take your life know where your family resides
Mama tells me stay inside, but I fear no man but god
So I'm out every day & night
I show up in my enemy's city, tasting my faith
Hoping I don't lose my life so I bow my head & I pray
Cause if my time comes then it was meant to come
But when everything said & done
All I ask of you is dont forget the love

I used to wanna be the toughest kid on the block
Till I found out the toughest kid always gets shot
I used to wanna make a mill pushin that rock
Till I found out the big timers always got caught
I used to wanna be the OG tellin a tale
Til I found out they only up dead or in jail
I was Lost and confused searchin for somebody to be
Till I realized that person I was searchin for was me
