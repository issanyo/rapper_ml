When the sun goes down I bow my head and pray, for my family and sins and those who've passed away. It truly amazes me the things that I've seen, and it seems so surreal cause it ain't make-believe. And best believe when you lose a loved one six feet deep, it'll tear you into two as you lay without sleep. Welcome to reality, what they said to me, but this death ain't no motherfuckin stranger to me. Grandmomma says stare at the cross, when I'm filled with evil, when I'm out feelin lost. Cause I remember when I hit the bottom of the rock, and I looked up to the Lord and asking, "Would it ever stop?" This hate and this gat, I'd rather love than live, give back to my folks for all the things they've ever did. I express my love and I give thanks, to my moms and pops, I love you til my neverending day. And I was placed here on earth to spread this message. You won't read the note I wrote until I end up where I'm headed

When the sun goes down, it always seems to rise again. A new day is born, a new life to live. And I ain't got no dough, I just got some advice to give. If you fall on your ass, get up and try again. Make sure you love yourself before you die within. We all go through similar struggles, and it's hard to find the light when you livin so subtle. How will I enjoy my life when I keep dinner with trouble? I don't care what they have to say about me, cause I ain't got nothin to prove. I used to be that low life with nothin to lose. They kicked me when I was down and they spit on my shoes. Suicidal thoughts, I didn't know what to do. Then I prayed to God for answers, didn't know who else to turn to. Sick of people speakin on that shit that don't concern you. Have you ever loved somebody so bad it fuckin hurts you? Searchin for a better life but patience is a virtue. And I don't know how much longer I can wait. And I don't know how much more pain I can take. It's only a matter of time before I meet my fate. So I pray, and I pray, cause it's never too late. Ask God for forgiveness for your past mistakes and heal the scars for family that passed away to help you see the light in the blackest days. Cause when the sun goes down it doesn't last a day
