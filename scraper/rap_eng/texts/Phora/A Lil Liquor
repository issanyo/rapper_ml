[Hook: Phora]
Yeah I pour a lil liquor out for all the ones that passed
Taking life slow, I’m just hoping that it lasts
It’s moving too fast, I ain’t got no brakes
And the clock keeps ticking man, time don’t wait, no
For all the ones that passed
Taking life slow, I’m just hoping that it lasts
It’s moving too fast, I ain’t got no brakes
And the clock keeps ticking man, time don’t wait, no

[Verse 1: Phora]
My life is moving so fast, there ain’t no way to slow it down
Plus there ain’t enough liquor in here to go around
But this last sip for the casket beneath the tombstones
And my cousin Nick grew up in a group home, never knew home
Cause every year he got a new mom and a new dad
While the rich kids buying new condos and new jags
We barely got enough to pay the gas bill
But it’s funny, we complain about money, we on our ass still
We always find another way to make that shot glass fill
Cause you ain’t gotta deal with the pain if you can’t feel
My body numb, they shot up some on the streets
Helicopter out my window with the sound of police
Don’t wanna know what going on no more
I don’t even know if it’s in me to write these fucking songs no more
All these hours spent venting, I just wish they understood
Death threats, sometimes I wish a nigga would
But I got unread messages, missed calls, don’t take it personal God
You’d probably be the same if niggas try to murder you God

[Hook: Phora]
Yeah I pour a lil liquor out for all the ones that passed
Taking life slow, I’m just hoping that it lasts
It’s moving too fast, I ain’t got no brakes
And the clock keeps ticking man, time don’t wait, no
For all the ones that passed
Taking life slow, I’m just hoping that it lasts
It’s moving too fast, I ain’t got no brakes
And the clock keeps ticking man, time don’t wait, no

[Verse 2: Eskupe]
I feel like this mics my ride or die
Seen the struggle, nine to five just to keep this dream alive
Ignorance is bliss, but it's stress in disguise
So I don't look to the skies or ask the Lord why
But I'm puffing out this window pane, watch time go past
I feel like I got grains left in my hour glass
So I pour a lil liquor and I sip a lil liquor
But it's fucking up my life and it's killing off my liver
Life's a bitch, should I stay or should I go?
Got the gun up to my dome piece and the cane up in my nose
I ain't scared of death, but you never really know
No plan is full proof man, we all gotta go
But see with caution, you never know who done it
Out here on the block, they quick to fucking bang like percussion
Plus all the forties I'm chugging, got momma rosary clutching
But I tell her it's all or nothing, ain't no room for discussion

[Hook: Phora]
Yeah I pour a lil liquor out for all the ones that passed
Taking life slow, I’m just hoping that it lasts
It’s moving too fast, I ain’t got no brakes
And the clock keeps ticking man, time don’t wait, no
For all the ones that passed
Taking life slow, I’m just hoping that it lasts
It’s moving too fast, I ain’t got no brakes
And the clock keeps ticking man, time don’t wait, no
