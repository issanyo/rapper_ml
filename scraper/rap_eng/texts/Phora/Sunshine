[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
Oh, ohhh, I need
Oh, ohhh, I need
Oh, ohh
I need, sunshine, I need, angels
I need, something good
Yeah I need, blue skies, I need old times
I need, something good, something good
Something good, something good, oh ohhh

[Verse 1: Phora]
Look, yeah, momma I know you going through pain right now
But you ain't alone cause I feel the same right now
Yeah I know you miss the times when they came around
But we just have to accept the fact that they're angels now
And they're smiling from up above
The things I'd to have them back even for just a hug
Even just to reminisce and laugh about how it was
They said that, "no form of hate in this world overpowers love" and I still believe it
Had every reason to fail yet I still succeeded
No matter how crazy your dream is you can still achieve it
I know you feel like they just want you to fail
So we fill our lungs with smoke every time we inhale
Like are we in hell, these cops just want to lock me in jail
See for three years of my life they let me rot in a cell
But I never let it make me bitter
Through my ups and downs I chase my dreams and aspirations momma never raised a quitter
But sometimes I need the sunshine to chase the clouds away
Sometimes I feel the good times are a million miles away
But I remember how far I came, took the bus, I was counting change, I could always see the light even in clouds of gray

[Pre-Hook]
I pray you're safe where ever you are
And I tell myself you're with me even if you're so far
Cause all I really need is love
A little sunshine from above
And when you need me I'll be there
Even when it gets hard

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
Oh, ohhh, I need
Oh, ohhh, I need
Oh, ohh
I need, sunshine, I need, angels
I need, something good
Yeah I need, blue skies, I need old times
I need, something good, something good
Something good, something good, oh ohhh

[Verse 2: Phora]
Yeah, like how can I fail when I got these angels with me?
And how can I not fly? I'm from halo city
And back in junior high my momma always said my pants were too baggy but she loves the way my halo fits me
Sometimes I ask for sunshine and it rains on me
I told her if you believe in me place your pain on me
Right before my grandpa passed he said he'd pray for me
So if there's hate in your heart then we ain't the same homie
And why is it easier to hate than show love?
We don't look up to the teachers but glorify who sold drugs
So we never show our feelings
He'd rather hugs his hand around his 45 than hugs his own mom, his own blood
It's crazy I know, I'm just a lost soul roaming no place I can go
And yo I'll probably feel this way when I'm 80 years old
Searching for those who feel the same
I can't make it alone, I can't make it alone
Like how can you hate a man and not acknowledge the pain he felt
Put him down, spit on him, and make him blame himself?
But in reality he's just a reflection of what you could've been
So the reason you hate him is cause you hate yourself
See I just pray for him, I was the same
I put my family through pain
But realized I had to change for'em
Back in school they used to laugh at me too
But keep dreamin' you never know what could happen to you
I mean

[Pre-Hook: Phora]
I pray you're safe where ever you are
And I tell myself you're with me even if you're so far
Cause all I really need is love
A little sunshine from above
And when you need me I'll be there
Even when it gets hard

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
Oh, ohhh, I need
Oh, ohhh, I need
Oh, ohh
I need, sunshine, I need, angels
I need, something good
Yeah I need, blue skies, I need old times
I need, something good, something good
Something good, something good, oh ohhh
