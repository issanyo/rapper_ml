[Hook]
We all make mistakes, head high
Wipe them tears off your face
Nobody ever notice you
Yeah, I know it gets rough
Yeah, but we all make mistakes
Keep your head high, wipe them tears off your face
You need someone but nobody ever notice you
Just remember you got angels watchin' over you

[Verse: 1]
I know times are gettin hard and it's tough to handle
But no matter what, promise you'll keep your head high
Cause I'd hate to lose another friend, this world's a battle and I shed blood, sweat, and tears just to get by
My only weakness is havin' a heart
And if I could change the world I wouldn't know where to start But if you truly want change you gotta start with yourself
So I'm workin' on my flaws and I ain't nobody else
But me and we all change when we get older
Call me what you want, beauty's in the eyes of the beholder Angels watchin' over, hah, bless my soul
Remember when I first told you friends turn foes
One was standin right next to me
Who would have known, shit
I love life but it's a bitch I just can't cope with
But I hope this helps you understand me
And if I never get the chance to win a Grammy my mom will still love me, and so will my granny, and so will the rest of my fans and most of my family
And yo, that's way more than I would ever ask
Good times are on the way, bad times, just let em pass
And I promise when I leave you'll never be alone
Angels watchin' over you when I'm gone
And I promise when I leave you'll never be alone
Angels watchin' over you when I'm gone

[Hook]
I know it gets rough, yeah, but we all make mistakes
Keep your head high, wipe them tears off your face
You need someone but nobody ever notice you
Just remember you got angels watchin' over you
Yeah, we all make mistakes, head high
Wipe them tears off your face
Nobody ever notice you
You got angels watchin' over you

[Verse: 2]
So get a grip and wipe them tears off your face and promise Yourself that you'll never lose faith
And when they tell you that this world don't have a place for you, I know a place that I can take you to
And I wonder, sometimes I wonder if they'll ever realize
When they look at me, they look into my people's eyes
I'm the voice of the children who never got to speak
And I'll never be silent so either talk to me or walk away
But whatever choice you choose to make
You'll have to live with forever
Go on and choose your fate
Child of the future, I'm here to make a difference
I could save a life and all you have to do is listen
Raised by the angels, my mother was sent from heaven
And even though life is rough, I cherish every second
And it's a blessin' to know that when I go to sleep
I have an angel watchin' over me
And it's a blessin' to know that when I go to sleep
I have an angel watchin' over me


[Hook]
I know it gets rough, yeah, but we all make mistakes
Keep your head high, wipe them tears off your face
You need someone but nobody ever notice you
Just remember you got angels watchin' over you
Yeah, we all make mistakes, head high
Wipe them tears off your face
Nobody ever notice you, you got angels watchin' over you

[Outro]
Wipe them tears off your face, wipe them tears off your face
Wipe them tears off your face
