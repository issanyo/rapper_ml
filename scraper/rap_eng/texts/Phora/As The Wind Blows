[Verse 1: Phora]
It's kind of funny, I'm old enough to go to war, but not to drink
When they lock me in a box, I had a lot of time to think
It's hell on earth, the devil wants your soul for what it's worth
But he won't take it homie, never, not from me
Cause in this cold world, that's all I got, that's my everything
And gang bangers are holocaust of the century
Who's really your enemy? Answer the question
They said I need help, give me therapy
I cancelled this session because
Nobody knows yourself more than you
And I have no explanation for the things I do
I just hope you know I ain't the villain, God is my witness
Him and I are the only ones that know my true intentions
But I could tell you once and I could tell you twice
But only you control the choices you make in your life
Whether it's wrong or right, we all have a place
Don't judge me for my flaws, but what I learn from my mistakes
Trust nowadays, it's difficult to come by
Lie too many times, you'll eventually get your tongue tied
Almost everyone I know sits around getting dumb high
While I sit in my room and plan a plot till the sun rise
Love it or hate it, regardless I'mma flourish
A rebel to the grain, the ones who follow have no courage
They used to put me down, until they see me shine
Now I'm laughing when they ask me for a second of my time
I put everything on the line until I had nothing left
They'll hear my voice until their very last fucking breath
Yeah until I had nothing left
They'll hear my voice until their very last fucking breath

[Hook: Phora]
As the wind blows, I'm looking out my window
Wondering if life will ever show me the light
Cause all I see is footsteps in the darkness
Shadows behind me and shady people so heartless
The ones with no soul or remorse
They wanna bring me down, yeah I know but of course
I watch my back and I take care of my kinfolk
Yeah we dying every second as the wind blows

Yeah I'm looking out my window
Wondering if life will ever show me the light
Cause all I see is footsteps in the darkness
Shadows behind me and shady people so heartless
The ones with no soul or remorse
They wanna bring me down, yeah I know but of course
I watch my back and I take care of my kinfolk
Yeah we dying every second as the wind blows
Looking out my window, show me the light
