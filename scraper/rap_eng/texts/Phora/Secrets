[Verse 1]
She said she couldn't stay too late
She gotta be home by ten, she had school the next day
She wasn't the type to play
She ain't like them other chicks
She ain't known for getting drunk, popping pills, or sucking dick
More like the type to show up to class
An hour early, never wearing shorts that's showing her ass
Got to hold on her past, can't let go of it
She don't really smile, but nobody ever notices
Grade A student, all her teachers love her
She just wished she felt that same love from her mother
But she's stuck in county jail for eighteen months
So its just her and pops and everyday he's drunk
They hardly talk, so when she gets to the house
She goes straight to her room and she shuts the lights out
Hoping the next day comes sooner than later
She can't wait to move out, four-hundred dollars saved up
She knows she got a long way to go
But she keeps her head so high, you'd probably never know
What she had to go through for so long
Yo, but she never forgets to hold on

[Hook]
She said, "If you knew my secret, I wonder what you'd say
I wonder if you'd leave and I wonder if you'd stay
I wonder if you'd see me in a different way
Its hard to hold this in, I think about it everyday"
Yeah, I wonder what you'd say
I wonder if you'd see me in a different way
I think about it everyday

[Verse 2]
She met a kid named Joey, knew he had a crush
Always made her laugh and said things to make her blush
But she tried so hard to pay him no attention
Scared her past would eventually ruin the friendship
Cause its so hard for her to open her feelings
He said, "If you don't give me your heart beautiful
I'mma steal it"
So twelve months passed and ever since he said that
She been in love, but everybody has their setbacks
Slowly, but surely he was fading away
While she was falling deeper for him and she waited for days
For him to call her like he always did, but five days went by and
If you listen closely you can hear her still crying
She wrote on paper saying, "I'm sorry"
I just wish you knew you're the reason that my heart beats
Always made me smile ever since the day you saw me
You were my guardian angel when I had nobody
Yo, but there's something I haven't told you
For six years there was something that I had to go through
That shattered my spirit and my dreams, I know you can see it
My father did these things to me and no one believed it
My mom was never there to see, I hope when she reads this
She ODs on the very thing that broke us to pieces
You were the only person I ever loved
And it kills me inside to know that I was the one
To ruin what we had and I knew this would happen
Yo, I just thought me and you would've lasted
Knife to her wrist as she dropped to the floor
But right be before she cut she heard a knock at the door

[Hook]
She said, "If you knew my secret, I wonder what you'd say
I wonder if you'd leave and I wonder if you'd stay
I wonder if you'd see me in a different way
Its hard to hold this in, I think about it everyday"
Yeah, I wonder what you'd say
I wonder if you'd see me in a different way
I think about it everyday
