[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse 1]
First of all, tell a rap nigga he can come and get it
Still the same one, run the shit, with the same team, ain't nothin' different
Heard that people talking, you just can't ignore it
You got a Grammy nomination, for an Oscar performance like hold up
Like nobody cares if you feel this shit
Like I'm in the slot, I be drilling shit
Age of 22, I made eleven million independent and killing shit
You wait for [?] to pay you
You wait for Epic to pay you
You wait for Atlantic to pay you
You just a slave to the label

[Chorus]
I ain't one for the talking
I just had to make it clear
Skeletons in my closet, I can make them disappear
I put them all in a body bag
I put them all in a body bag
I put them all in a body bag
I ain't one for the talking
Had to make the shit clear
Skeletons in my closet, I can make them disappear
I put them all in a body bag
I put them all in a body bag
I put them all in a body bag

[Verse 2]
Why you really want all the smoke nigga
I'm gonna cut your throat nigga
[?]
Twisted for not having second and think I won't hunt for you niggas
I'm just doing my dance, I'm just doing my dance
Everybody like slow down, wait don't do 'em like that
But I had to do  it, I just want to bring some action to it
If they ever try to diss me back then I just rip a track and I get back into it
I ain't stopping, I'm just going back to back to back to back to back to back
Just rapping through it, send a sorry letter to they momma house where they skeleton
Where I'm attaching to it
They don't wanna see you win
They don't wanna see you win

[Chorus]
I ain't one for the talking
I just had to make it clear
Skeletons in my closet, I can make them disappear
I put them all in a body bag
I put them all in a body bag
I put them all in a body bag
I ain't one for the talking
Had to make the shit clear
Skeletons in my closet, I can make them disappear
I put them all in a body bag
I put them all in a body bag
I put them all in a body bag
