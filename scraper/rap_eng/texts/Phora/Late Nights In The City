[Verse 1]
Late nights in the city
Just me and the team
We been on the grind like 24/7 just kids with a dream
Late nights in the city
Mighta been drinking too much
But I been going through a lot
Man, these past 2 weeks I been thinking too much
I've been thinking about Mom tryna feed my fam
Never had a label, they ain't seen my plan
Did this shit alone, they didn't even no ask
Nowadays all these niggas with they egos, man
Fareal, yall too stuck up
Come around here and prolly get fucked up
Pops taught me in the streets there's no trust, so I trust no man
Yeah its all fucked up, shit I'm fucked up
Sippin til we catching a buzz
Used to be catching a bus, now we catching them flights
Cruising through the city, we watching the skyline like it's my time
Anything can happen tonight
Chu know
She said I know whatchu mean
Don't run from your feelings, you can show em to me
And she said don't stress too much
Just go and live your life cause you're livin' what most of them dream

[Hook]
I told her I ain't gotta worry about a thing
All my niggas true and we livin' like some kings
Roll up a blunt, they be puffin' that green
You know
Late nights in the city, just me and and my crew
Ridin' around the town with my head down low
Livin' life fast and be sippin' like slow

[Verse 2]
Ridin' around town with my niggas with my shit full blast
AC blowin' we triyn' to get this cash
We tryna make these moves because they said we couldn't
And everybody in my circle down for taking a bullet, my nigga what
Got my windows down
All I get is love when I'm in your town
So why the fuck is you hating
I do this shit for my family
And moms said the other day she's never been so proud
She seen the good when they all saw the devil in me
Labels over here tryna sell me a dream
I ain't trippin'
It's just me and the team
And baby you should see the view in my city, it's a helluva scene
Shit I got
Good intentions and bad moves
A body full of tattoos
With the world on my back and checked off  list of all the shit they said I can't do
Everything is alright, everything is cool
Late nights in the city dawg, just me and the crew
But I've been stressin' so much man, shit I need a lil break
My city can't wait
They've been holding me down
Reppin' my town, I ain't got no time for no fakes
So I'm sippin slow for the Henny goin' down my throat
Reppin my city like it's the only one I know
Focused my mind and write down my goals
I might've lost my friends, but I found my soul
I know
Late night conversations
She asked I was happy with the life I lead
And all i do is tell her I'm just glad to be alive on nights like these

[Hook]
I told her I ain't gotta worry about a thing
All my niggas true and we livin' like some kings
Roll up a blunt, they be puffin' that green
You know
Late nights in the city, just me and and my crew
Ridin' around the town with my head down low
Livin' life fast and be sippin' like slow
