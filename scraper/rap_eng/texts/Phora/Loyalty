You should be treated like royalty, baby
I know all that you wanted was loyalty, baby, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
She got missed calls on her phone now
She worth more and she know now
Ex man tryna work it out
But she happy on her own now
'Cause what's love when you need someone but they just dont know what it means?
He tried to treat you like a pawn
But he ain't know you a queen
Checkmate for that lame ass nigga
If I ever see him, I'd prolly fade that nigga
Tried to blame you for the things he did
And he said he made you, but you made that nigga
Like, you too good for him
But you did what you could for him
So now she focused on herself, treat her body right like a new foreign
Kylie Jenner on the lips, yeah
J. Lo with the hips, yeah
She just wanna be appreciated
Cinderella need a prince, yeah
And she say loyalty is all she need right now
Need right now

So you should be treated like royalty, baby
I know all that you wanted was loyalty, baby, oh yeah
All of these niggas are stuck in they ways
But you poppin' and you give a fuck what they say
Give a fuck what they say, yeah
You should be treated like royalty, baby
I know all that you wanted was loyalty, baby, oh yeah
All of these niggas are stuck in they ways
But you poppin' and you give a fuck what they say
Give a fuck what they say

[Verse 2]
You learned to let go and you poppin' now
Fuck what they say and you poppin' off
Focus on yourself, don't need no one else
You the only thing they talk about
Everybody wanna roll with you
But they don't know what you been goin' through
You just wanna get away sometimes, I could tell that you get lonely, too
And lately you been on the wave, yeah
You can never be replaced, nah
Lowkey they been talkin' 'bout you, but they never say it to your face
Yeah, she got attitude, but she a lovergirl
I think she could be a CoverGirl
You ain't fuckin' with these other girls
You the type to get me in some trouble, girl
It's like Nike how these bitches checkin' on ya
Do ya thing, I see you flexin' on 'em
Ever since you been done with niggas, all of a sudden niggas want to get to know you
But all of these niggas is stuck in they ways, hey
But really you just need some company, babe
And that's whyâ€”
