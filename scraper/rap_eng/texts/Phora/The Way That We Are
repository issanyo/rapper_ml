[Verse 1: Phora]
She don't need a man dawg, all she need is company
Acting like she don't wanna fuck with me
And she hit me up when I least expect that shit
Now she over here asking what's up with me
I told her same old thang, same old thang
But I can't chase no broads and play no games
Cause all I know is that I can't be the one for you
Be there when you're lonely girl cause all you do is use these niggas
And she bad, but she ain't no good for me
I love when you say you got a thing for the boy, but I hate when you give that look to me
Cause I know, baby i know what you're saying without  even saying it
This feelin' you feeling now
Girl their ain't no replacing it
So show me it's real
Trust no soul
Yeah I know how your feel
You ain't no good, but I need your ass so bad
Shit, I just hope that it's real

[Hook: Versailles]
I guess it's just the way that we are
We run so hard but we don't get far
I'm broken but you're the one that can piece me together
But we know we ain't ours
We ain't ours

[Verse 2: Versailles]
I know you hope that it's real. But what's real ain't paying
I can't be the one for you, but I'll still come through cause my love ain't patient
See I can't go back to that thinking, cause that's the thinking that got me fucked up and needing ya
How come it's easy to be what I am
Than tell you what is on my chest, but all I can
Say is, you and I are on the same page ,in the same book, got a different face. It don't make sense, but you'll understand
Do you have a good intention or another bad vibe
You are not a bad guy, just got a little bad side
Try to see from my eyes
You just want me for the idea
And even though I'm everything that you fear
You can do the math and see a dime's cheap, you'll still wanna buy her everything dear
Maybe it's a stretch but you got that thing about you
Pain is the thing that I see around you
Knowing what the price of this here is I don't wanna chance what I got to appear I found it
Lost into you and I'm down for a change
But it's hard to be all for only you
I'm out for mine and you out for me
We all we got and gotta lose

[Hook: Versailles]
I guess it's just the way that we are
We run so hard but we don't get far
I'm broken but you're the one that can piece me together
But we know we ain't ours
We ain't ours

[Outro: Phora]
She don't need a man dawg, all she need is company
Acting like she don't wanna fuck with me
And she hit me up when I least expect that shit
Now she over here asking what's up with me
I told her same old thang, same old thang
But I can't chase no broads and play no games
Cause all I know is that I can't be the one for you
Be there when you're lonely girl cause all you do is use these niggas
And she bad, but she ain't no good for me
