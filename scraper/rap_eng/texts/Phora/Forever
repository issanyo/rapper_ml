[Verse 1]
Yeah, you said you need some assurance, I wrote this song for you
I've been stressin' and I don't know how to talk to you
I've been dealin' with pressure, our picture's still on the dresser, when it comes down to it, trust me, I'd give it all to you
Before you, I ain't know what happiness is
A type of love I was missin' back as a kid
I'm livin' life on the edge, I've been takin' risks
I'm—too young to worry about marriage and having kids, but
You make me think about it, like really think about it
You say you just need an answer, I try to creep around it
But the truth is I'm just scared of commitment
My parents separated young, shit, I want this to be different
I wanna—get to know you from the inside-out
I know you know I got a past, I know you still got doubts
Know I still do a couple things that you still not 'bout
There might be a couple girls that I still need to cut out
But I brought the scissors with me
I could be your caretaker like SZA with me
I just wanna love you, that's the mission with me
Just promise not to switch up and be different with me, yeah
'Cause things change and people change, but I've learned that's just emotions sometimes
I ain't noticed love was blind until I opened my eyes
Stayin' up late nights, we never notice the time
Even though we distant I just hope I'm still on your mind, like

[Spoken]
Yo, what's good?
Look, I ain't even tryna fight with you right now
I'm just—I'm just sayin', look
We've been through way too much to just let this shit go like that
I wanna make this shit work
If you love me like you say you do
Cut the games, cut the bullshit, let me know how you feel
There's no one else out there for me, but you

[Verse 2]
Yeah
3 In the morning, I'm steady thinkin' 'bout you
You on my mind so often I barely sleep without you, yeah
It's crazy I'm not complete without you
People around me, they check themselves 'fore they speak about you
But—you should know that you're still the one for me
Instead of tryin' to come for me, you should comfort me
You really need to stop textin' sayin' you done with me
'Cause everytime you on that type of shit it just fucks with me
'Cause I've been goin' through it, you know I'm goin' through it
You know I'm dealin' with family issues, I'm goin' through this
Motion in life why I've stressin' like crazy
And I've been lettin' pressure get the best of me lately
But I want them late nights with you
Them date nights with you
Them all around the world, takin' plane flights with you, it's real
How you feel? I ain't lyin', I need you
We've been way too distant lately, tell me, when can I see you?
It's like, I know you need someone who can be faithful to you
But you need someone to prove it, not to just say it to you
See, I'm just tryna put these pieces back together
I can promise you I'll stay, but I can't promise you forever, like

[Spoken]
Nah, look
I'm done arguin' with you, I'm done arguin' with you
Hold up, listen
For real?
Okay, that's how you feel?
Haha, wow, you crazy
So what time can I come over?
Alright, I'll be there
