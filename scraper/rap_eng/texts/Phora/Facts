[Verse 1]
Hold up, look
I just can't fuck with y'all
All you lookin' funny, man, what's up with y'all?
Anything you doin', man, we not involved
Funny how we used to look up to y'all, we looked up to y'all
But y'all fake as shit
I've been in the studio for days and shit
24/7 on my Vegas shit
You know the 702 gon' play this shit, they gon' play this shit
Like, aye

[Hook]
Whole team stay blessed
Need the liqour for the stress
Got the Henney with the X.O
Whole squad up next
Tell the label, "Cut the check"
I've been prayin' for the best
I've been dealin' with the stress

Aye, wait, hold up
Let me flex and shit
Copped the R8, then I wrecked this shit
Then I dropped a hunnid on a Z06, this for all you niggas sayin' I'm depressed and shit
Lambo outside with the extra tint, I'm on the "H-Town-screwed-up-Texas" shit
If I ever said it, then I meant that shit

Real one, she ain't never went ghost, aye
She deserve a ring and a crown and a house
Yo' girl get a root beer float, aye
None of my squad with the fake, aye
Better ease up with the waste
Fuck out my face, shit, I'd rather go broke with my team than get rich with a snake like that

[Bridge]
Wait, fuck all that
