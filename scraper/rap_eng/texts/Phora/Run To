[Chorus]
You just need someone you can run to
You just need someone to hold on to
You just need someone who could love you
You just need someone who could trust you
You just need someone you can run to
You just need someone to hold on to
You just need someone who could love you
You just need someone who could trust you

[Verse]
They will never see the beauty in her
Love is something she ain't never felt
The saddest part about the whole thing
She ain't even see the beauty in herself
She was looking for it, she an angel even heaven knows
To me she was like a rose in a city where they say a flower never grows
She holding back but can't run from it
Broken family, she come from it
The past only left her broken hearted
So she built a wall to keep love from it
They don't wanna know the real you
They just wanna say they feel you
Lying just to feel something real
To the point you hope it doesn't kill you
But I could tell from all the songs in your playlist
Lipsticks and your fragance
You still running from the past
Laughin at your ex saying that he ain't shit
But you just empty on the inside
Can't feel nothing on the inside
Telling everybody you a savage but you really dying on the inside
But everyone needs someone
You sick doing all the chasing
You need someone to run to
You losing all of your patience
She trynna' find that real love
Numb to the pain all she wanna do is feel love

[Chorus]
You just need someone you can run to
You just need someone to hold on to
You just need someone who could love you
You just need someone who could trust you
You just need someone you can run to
You just need someone to hold on to
You just need someone who could love you
You just need someone who could trust you
