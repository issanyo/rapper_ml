[Intro]
(Uhhh one, two)

[Chorus]
I got two dollars in my pocket for the bus ride home
(for the bus ride home) for the bus ride home
(for the bus ride home) for the bus ride home
(for the bus ride home). I guess I'm on my own, yeah
I hope I make it home safe. (I hope I make it home safe)
Hope I make it home safe (I hope I make it home safe)
I hope I make it home safe (I hope I make it home safe)

[Bridge]
Yeah these streets
My friends are enemies in disguise
They all gonna switch up
It's just a matter of time
Seems like the life I used to live is just passing me by
I wanna know some answers Lord
I'm just asking you why
Why you gotta take the lives of innocent kids
And watch their families suffer?
There's people under the bridge
Asleep without eatin supper
Plus it's gettin crazy round where I stay
Nowadays it ain't safe
Cause these niggas don't play
Two kids from the east side
Had a high speed chase with the cops
Right off of Malvern
Is where they got caught
Runnin' from murder
They ain't stoppin so they let off some shots
One of them dead at the fatal cost
Of reppin the block
The other one locked away for good
For taking a life
Everything has a cost
And you'll be paying the price
When you put numbers on a nigga's head
It ain't gon be worth it
Karma comes back like a receipt
After you makin that purchase

[Verse]
Waitin for the bus
Hope I get home without gettin jacked
Past tense
The gangstas are rollin round with a strap
Look
And I just pray to God they leave me alone
Cause all I got is two dollars
And I'm just tryin to get home
Cause it happened to my boy
And they said empty your pockets
Took his phone, gun to his head
Started checkin his wallet, padded him down
Then took everything he had in his jeans

[Verse]
I'm glad he's alive
I just hope it doesn't happen to me
You don't know whether or not
They're gonna pull on that trigger
Just to- prove to his niggas from the hood that he's with it
Takin another person's life- just so he can earn some stripes
Jackin' old ladys now
It makes me toss and turn at night
It ain't right if you think jackin' fools is cool
I'ma let you know now
It's gonna catch up to you soon
Pullin' straps on people
Thinkin' everything's fine
'til you get caught and you cry to the judge givin you time
And I'm just
Speakin' my mind and I don't care if you disagree
I'm just sick of seein kids get jacked and killed in my city, G
(Get killed in my city, G)
And I don't care if you disagree
I'm just sick of seein kids get jacked and killed in my city, G

[Chorus]
I got two dollars in my pocket for the bus ride home
(for the bus ride home) for the bus ride home
(for the bus ride home) for the bus ride home
(for the bus ride home). I guess I'm on my own, yeah
I hope I make it home safe. (I hope I make it home safe)
Hope I make it home safe (I hope I make it home safe)
I hope I make it home safe (I hope I make it home safe)
Cause these streets don't play

[Outro]
All my friends are enemies in disguise
They all gonna switch up
It's just a matter of time
Seems like the life I used to live
Is just passing me by
I wanna know some answers Lord
I'm just asking you why
Why you gotta take the lives of innocent kids
Watch their families suffer?
There's people under the bridge
That sleep without eatin' supper now
(that sleep without eatin' supper now). X4
