[Verse]
Nothin but Top Ramen noodles in my stomach
I sleep alone, I hear a peep im wakin up quick
Paranoia got me buggin out in public
I speak the truth, unlike the niggas that you fuck with
Claiming they the dopest, who the fuck you tryna convince?
They tried to take my life, and I ain't hit a blunt since
Because I gotta stay cautious of all my functions
Never do I trustin, any man but God, my 2 feet is who I run with
Me, myself and I
Cause all these niggas gonna do is help you die
Lord slice these tats off my throat if I tell them lies
Our revolutions televised but its well disguised
Don't trust em
Devils in my ear, nigga fuck em
Throwin all these girls my way, and Ill be honest yeah I love em
But the music and the money comes above em
But this loneliness is tempting me to fuck em
Been done dirty, fucked over every way you can imagine
Ex girl hates me with a passion
No time for games or the questions that you askin
No cuts, 3 2 1 ready action
Nigga that's life
But im on the rise like the gas price
We got once chance, I never ask twice
That's life
But im on the rise like the gas price
We got one chance, I never ask twice
Cause im quick to cut a nigga off
The middle mans eliminated when I get involved
Im bout my business like a jew in a tux
Honestly Im not concerned, who gives a fuck
Long as im gettin paid nigga
Burying these dead presidents, call me the grave digger
VERSE 2
Hard work and perseverance is the motto
Askin everyone I know if they have hope that I can borrow
Seen so many people drown their pain with the bottle
Smoke they problems away and do the same shit tomorrow
But me, I embrace the pain
Put that needle in my neck, nigga take the pain
And these tattoos represent the stories of my life
Good times, bad times, struggle and strife
They say ill never get a job with all the tats
They ask if I regret it, guess they just don't see where im headed
Straight to the fucken top, I got my future planned out
And I did it with no fucken hand outs
Im doin tats to put that money in the music
But sometimes I feel like im just gonna lose it
They ask me if Im ready, well we gon see
I just don't know if the world is ready for me
