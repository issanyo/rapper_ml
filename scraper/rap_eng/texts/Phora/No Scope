[Intro]
Uh, fake shit all around me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm aiming straight for the head
I'm aiming straight for the head
And I ain't stopping until all of 'em dead, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head
And I ain't stopping until all of 'em dead, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head
And I ain't stopping until all of 'em dead, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, uh
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head
And I ain't stopping until all of 'em dead, yeah

[Verse]
Wait, hold up, look, fuck all that singing shit
I just make moves and I bring this shit
I just do this 'cause I bleed this shit
Starboy like The Weeknd shit
Rap niggas always tweeting shit
Living false lives, tell me how it feel every night you gotta sleep with it
I just wanna know who runnin' shit so I can come for they neck
I ain't with the disrespect
I ain't with the talkin' if you ain't cuttin' the check
Give a fuck 'bout who's next
I ain't fucking with the mumble rap
Swear to God I had enough of that
But I guess that's better than all of that motherfuckin' fake 1-800 rap
I just wanna be alive, yeah
I just wanna be alive, yeah
If you ever try to fuck with me then best believe it's really suicide
Look, y'all niggas make me sick
All of y'all fake, that's it
Straight like this
Hope you don't kiss your girl 'cause you probably gonna taste this dick, taste this dick
That way, I know some things that I can't say
Uh, yeah, that way, two hundred K on a bad day
Yeah, not including all the tours, nigga
You can go and check the Forbes, nigga
I just gave it back to all the people that was down with me when I was poor, nigga
All facts, all facts, yeah
All facts, all facts, yeah
Your favorite rapper said he wanna make a song with me, I'll pass
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it dawg, yeah, you did it yourself
We don't wanna see you all up on Twitter talking loud
Keep that shit to yourself, just keep that shit to yourself
I'm just killing shit at random, I'm just killing shit at random
All these rappers throwin' tantrums
How you hard with a man bun? (Ha)
But I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I just keep goin' and goin' and goin', I'll take a break when I'm dead, I'll take a break when I'm dead

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
And I ain't stopping until all of 'em dead, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, uh
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head
And I ain't stopping until all of 'em dead, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head
And I ain't stopping until all of 'em dead, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head, uh
I'm aiming straight for the head, yeah
I'm aiming straight for the head
And I ain't stopping until all of 'em dead, yeah
