[Verse 1]
Yeah, look
Pops told me this life is way too short for you not to live in the moment
Made a few mistakes in my time, but I'm still growin'
Embracin' all these feelings these people are scared of showin'
I'm showin' you all my pain in my story, the book is open
It's real
Every chapter in my life is a lesson
But the girl I gave my heart to, we've been losin' connection
She ain't realize that she was a blessing
We just lost in a world, driftin' apart, we never had no direction
See, I'm losin' all my patience lately, I've been tryna pray more
She said, "You always leave when I need you, I wish you'd stay more."
Dyin' to feel alive, you holdin' on to your pride
I used to be the one you'd run to, what you walkin' away for?
Look, why can't we just be real with each other?
Instead of hatin' each other, let's start healin' each other
Are we really scared of love or just scared that we'll never find it?
I need you, and I'm done tryna hide it
So r u stillâ€”

[Hook]
R u still down for me?
R u still down for me?
R u still down for me?
R u still down for me?
Oh yeah
R u still down for me?
R u still down for me?
R u still down for me?
R u still down for me?
Oh yeah
R u still down for me?

R u still down for me?
R u still down for me?

[Outro]
We all need someone to talk to
Dealin' with the pressure of the world, all the shit we had to go through
She livin' life in the fast lane, in the fast lane tryna roll through
Aye, we all feel low sometimes, we all need someone to talk to
Yeah, we all feel low sometimes, we all need someone to talk to
Dealin' with the pressure of the world, all the shit we had to go through
She livin' life in the fast lane, in the fast lane tryna roll through
Aye, we all feel low sometimes, we all need someone to talk to
Yeah, we all feel low sometimes
