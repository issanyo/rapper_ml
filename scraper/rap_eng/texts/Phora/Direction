[Chorus]
Right direction
Point me towards the right direction
Life's all about the lessons
I'm losing my mind obsessin', mind obsessin'
Point me towards the right direction
I just wanna love you
Tell me can I trust you?
I promise it'll be just you
Just you, just you, yeah
Point me towards the right direction
Life's all about the lessons
I'm losing my mind obsessin', mind obsessin'
Point me towards the right direction

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just wanna take my time
But I heard through the grapevine
Your heart's been broke like mine
Searching for a love that we can't find
I push away 'cause I'm numb still
I get scared and I run still
Maybe 'cause I'm new to this whole thing
And I don't really know the way love feels
Forgive me, I'm just so empty
I just need someone to love and uplift me
I just need someone to love and uplift me
I just need someone to trust me and gets me like uh
Forgive me, I'm just so empty
I just need someone to love and uplift me
I just need someone to trust me and gets me
I just need someone that's only gon' show me the

[Chorus]
Right direction
Point me towards the right direction
Life's all about the lessons
I'm losing my mind obsessin', mind obsessin'
Point me towards the right direction
I just wanna love you
Tell me can I trust you?
I promise it'll be just you
Just you, just you

[Post-Chorus]
What can I do?
I just want you
What can I do?
What can I do?
What can I do?
I just want you
What can I do?
What can I
What can I do?
I just want you

[Outro]
In a day and age where trust doesn't exist
Who can I turn to?
Point me towards the right direction
Never thought it would be this way
Life's all about the lessons
Everything's so different now
I'm losing my mind obsessin', mind obsessin'
I lost everything
Point me towards the right direction
Can I trust you?
I just wanna love you
Can I love you?
Tell me can I trust you?
What is love anymore
I'm still trying to find out
Can you hear me?
Don't let go
Don't let go
Point me towards the right direction
Don't let go
