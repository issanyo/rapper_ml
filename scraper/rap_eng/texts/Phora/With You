[Verse 1]
Sometimes my mind drifts way back to the past
Holding onto the last string, trying to make this shit last
It's hard to tell who's real or fake, everybody got a mask
But you was always down to ride, I ain't never had to ask
Never doubted you not once girl, you was always there
I was just running from my feelings, I don't know why I'm so scared
Maybe I just wasn't ready, maybe you was too perfect
You came in, I fell for you, started not to feel so worthless
But sometimes these things don't really turn out for the better, no
Been a minute since we last talked
Everybody telling me just to let it go
Both of us been through so much, all the pain, it will never show
Always wondered how you really felt
Shit, I guess I'll probably never know, but it's all okay
Yeah, maybe we wasn't meant to be
Maybe me, I was meant for you, but you just wasn't meant for me
Maybe I should just give it time, maybe I should just let it be
Crazy how it was me and you, but the whole time it was never "We"
Cause I know it was hard for you to trust me again
Cause all these other girls just want to fuck or be friends
But no one got that type of love that I feel with you
Then you say, "Why do you stay with me if its just to pretend?"
Don't lie to yourself, don't act like you ready
If you still love someone else, don't say that you sorry
No more, that's not gonna help
Cause you're only sorry after the damage is dealt

[Chorus]
I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you
I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you
I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you
Yeah, I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you
I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you
I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you
I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you
Yeah, I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you

[Bridge]
I ain't got nothing to hide, no
Hide, no, I've been searching for some time now
My eyes low, you bring the wave when the tide low
The tide low, her body like she from LA, attitude from Chicago
You know you got it
Yeah, never met no girl like you and that's just being honest
You can keep a secret, but you never kept your promise
But baby we can make this work again, just think about it

[Chorus]
I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you
Yeah, I know you need me with you
Cause I feel the same about you

[Bridge]
I ain't got nothing to hide, no
Hide, no, I've been searching for some time now
My eyes low, you bring the wave when the tide low
The tide low, her body like she from LA, attitude from Chicago
You know you got it
Yeah, you know you got it
You know you know, I know you know
