[Verse 1: Phora]
There's nothing like a smart woman that can hold a conversation
Knows how to act in public, knows how to be patient
And tells you to wait before you get up in her pants
I understand, I see beneath the titties and the ass
I'm trying to get to know you, all them lames is trying to hit it
They always in a rush, I like to take my time with it
And just coast, see what this leads to
And when you free, let me know when I can see you
I know you got shit to handle and I respect that
Independent woman on the grind, trying to get that
We all got setbacks, let me know if you need somethin'
She in school, she trying to be somethin'
She got her head in the books, all that drama, she ain't into that
Other chicks got they head in they ass or a nigga's lap
And she ain't got no home girls, they all shady
It's a difference in a bitch and a lady
You feel me? and she ain't got no home girls, they all shady
It's a difference in a bitch and a lady, in a bitch and a lady

See most chicks out there, just looking for the next man to pay they rent and they bills
They tell you they love you, but they don't know how love feels
They don't know what it means, they don't know what it's worth
That's why you need to learn to separate the real from the fake, and the fake from the real
And there's a lot of things that folks don't know in this world
And one of em's the difference between a ho and a girl

[Verse 2: Phora]
And I ain't never met a beauty like you
Other girls couldn't come close, even if they tried to
See, if it was up to me, I wouldn't let you go
The choice is yours, so if you wanna stay, just let me know
And yo, we can have a little fun if you want to
We can take a little ride if you want to
Yeah, and we can play twenty-one questions
I'll tell you anything, just don't ask about my ex's
Let's leave the past behind, never go back in time
Just tell me where you wanna go, put your hand in mine
Yeah, and just close your eyes and listen
Let me show you everything that you've been missing
Even though, nobody's perfect, you come the closest to it
And if you tell me you down with me, I'mma hold you to it
And there's nothing like the way that she sing
Too bad she only exist in my dreams
