[Intro: Yung Pinch]
Hit-Boy
Lately I've been tweaking, been thinking something don’t feel right
Yeah, oh

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Lately I've been tweaking, been thinking something don't feel right, yeah, yeah
This is real life, this is real life
She said she ain’t never seen no demons in the real life
They all around me, I can't live no more
'Cross the country, got it lit on tour
Diamonds dancing like they hit the floor
They keep asking what it hit me for
Ooh baby, when you talk like that
Ooh baby, when you talk like that, yeah
Ooh baby, when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Yeah, bring that thing back

[Verse 1: Yung Pinch]
Shawty wanna talk back, she so childish
Dressed myself this morning, no stylist
Shawty telling all lies, I won't buy it
Yeah, I hope you been adding up yo mileage
I'm speeding
I heard you needed me
But I'm leaving, I'm leaving secretly
You better listen what I'm saying when I tell you these things
And you best not treat me different when I’m rocking these chains
I know you from the jump, yeah
You could take it how you want
I know there’s so much more for you than me right now
Yeah

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Lately I've been tweaking, been thinking something don’t feel right
Lately I've been tweaking, been thinking something don't feel right
She ain't never seen no demons in the real life
They all around me, I can’t live no more
'Cross the country, got it lit on tour
Diamonds dancing like they hit the floor
They keep asking what it hit me for
Ooh baby, when you talk like that
Ooh baby, when you talk like that, yeah
Ooh baby, when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Yeah, bring that thing back

[Verse 2: Phora]
Ayy
I've been feeling low now
I've been taking too much shit, I'm tryna slow down
Ever since you left me I been on my own now
I been really trying not to lose control now, ayy
Yeah, all these demons in my head, tryna shoot 'em down
All these niggas fake as fuck when they come around
I'm just tryna hold you, tryna lay you down
I'm just tryna make you smile, wanna make you proud
Ooh baby. when you walk like that
I ain't never seen you talk like that
You should know I need you here right now
You took it from me and you brought it right back
Yeah
Demons in my head, yeah, a nigga never sleep
Tender Love and Care, baby girl I'm tryna creep
I been with you seven days, now a nigga weak, ayy
He got what you want
I got what you need

[Chorus: Yung Pinch & Phora]
Lately I've been tweaking, been thinking something don't feel right  (Something don't, something don't feel right)
Lately I've been tweaking, been thinking something don't feel right
She ain't never seen no demons in the real life
They all around me, I can't live no more
'Cross the country, got it lit on tour
Diamonds dancing like they hit the floor
They keep asking what it hit me for
Ooh baby, when you talk like that
Ooh baby, when you talk like that, yeah
Ooh baby, when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Yeah, bring that thing back

[Outro: Yung Pinch]
When you talk like that
And you wanna spend this cash
We been living fast
