[Chorus]
It's like, the more I try, the less I feel
In desperate need of something real
Why, lately I ain't been the same?
And why I try so hard to hide this pain
I search, but I can't ever find
Can't seem to leave my past behind
'Cause all the ones I hope would stay
Are all the ones that fade away

[Verse]
Truth is I think about you often
I miss your voice, I miss your smile that I used to get lost in
I know you know I have this thing for you, I never lost it
I think I just lost myself, in the midst of the non-sense
9 times out of 10, I'd close my eyes and dream about you
Don't know what it was, but you just had this thing about you
Lately we've been distant, see, I just can't be without you
And my soul got so attached to yours
I can't be me without you
But, we hate ourselves because we run from the people we love
And we all hold on to the past 'cause we miss what it was
Don't wanna feel so we try to numbin' the pain with these drugs
Living in hell, 'cause we lost faith in the place up above
And my anxiety is breaking me, it kills me
I'm living in a world so fake, I lost touch of the real me
Had to take a look back, just to ask me if I'm still me
And would I still stand for this if they wanted to kill me?
I can't take it no more, I just can't take it no more
I can't smile like I'm okay, I just can't fake it no more
I can't act like I've been happy and complacent no more
'Cause every time I try to change, it is the same as before
My karma's coming, my karma's coming, it's weighing in
I'm drinking till all my feelings just fade away again
And mama, she always told me "this ain't a way to live"
But, when you feel what I'm feeling that's just the way it is
I'm trying not to break down but I just can't hide this pain
Saw myself in the mirror and I'm just not the same
But who's to blame? I guess we all change
We hurt the ones we love because of our pain, fuck...

[Chorus]
It's like, the more I try, the less I feel
In desperate need of something real
Why, lately I ain't been the same?
And why I try so hard to hide this pain
I search, but I can't ever find
Can't seem to leave my past behind
'Cause all the ones I hope would stay
Are all the ones that fade away

[Outro]
Are all the ones that fade away
Are all the ones that fade away
