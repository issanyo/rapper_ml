[Verse: Phora]
I just wanna get to know myself before my time comes to an end
If it's possible, maybe share my life with a friend
Never had nobody love me for the person that I am
I admit that my mistakes have helped me turn into a man
And I'm still searching for a plan, face taking me for a ride
Don't know quite where I'm going, but destiny's by my side
And yo regret is nowhere to be seen
My reality's a fantasy, man I'm living my dreams
If today was my last day I would write a song to let you know
That I thank you from the bottom of my soul
You saved my life, I could have been gone a while ago
Hope my enemies realize what I was standing for
I swear on my life that I'm spitting the truth
I make mistakes, I'm a human, I'm no different than you
Yo, and I just want to thank the fans for your support
Every time I quit the game, y'all help me back up to the court
And told me keep going, keep moving
So in return I put my fucking life into this music
And I just pray that it helps y'all like y'all helped me
Even if it's only one person and no one else sees
Thou who hasn't sinned, may punish me for my sins
So before you point at me, you better look deep within
Your own path, they always said I won't last
But I never surrounded myself by cats with no class
Everyone in my circle showed me a part of me
Helped me change for the better and soon you'll probably see
That any situation you can learn from
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, like your first love
And I was always taught to wait until my turn comes
Now that it's here, I'm getting what I deserve
I just wish I could go back into time and how it first was
I never really fully understood the word love
But it's something I'm certain about that's deep inside me
But I ain't searching for it, I'm just gonna let it find me
Yeah, it's something I'm certain about, it's deep inside me
But I ain't searching for it, I'm just gonna let it find me
Dear Lord, forgive me for my sins
And watch over the ones I love, if I shall pass today
I hope I'll be remembered by the good that I did
Rather than the mistakes that I've made
I thank you for what I do have
Instead of being ungrateful for what I'm missing
Now every breath is closer to my last
That's what makes that breath of fresh air so much more valuable
In Jesus name I pray, amen
