[Verse 1]
I was mobbing through the east
I can get you product cheap
I got Givenchy on my feet
And all them Jordans I get free
Niggas diss me on the Instagram
Real life them niggas nerds
Bunch of lames, I drop some change
I move exactly how you heard
Y'all know me Rose sweet
So I’m on Dom-P leaning all on the curb
Two thumbs up
Like a good movie on TV
Yeah do it all for the third
No feelings 100 Gowalla on me
Talking about that big dope dealer money
Pull up in the range, no ceiling on it
Gorilla glue is what I roll in the morning
I woke up with a couple hoes I was on the road doing shows
Tryna get that other old nigga money
So then you ain’t gotta count that
I got it by my waistline
Pay me if you owe that money
Brownskin Jawn, I let you roll that for me
Off white hoodie, belt Goyard on me
I don’t trust you enough to let you hold no money
Just know that new Bent off the show room coming
Dipping and dodging the Jakes
I ain’t got no patience, I not going to wait
I ain’t have dimes up in spot selling shake
Bootleggers uptown now they selling my tape
I’m just a bad motherfucker
I bring Stacey Dash up The Rucker
I ain’t got no yack for these suckers
I’m plotting on pressure survive what you couldn’t (push it)

[Bridge]
Jump out the Rover it look like baking Soda
Arm and hammer whip game right
I fuck your bitch on the same night
She ain’t want to leave, had to change flights
I know about that cocaine life
I’m Kurt Cobain when I change sprite
Me and your plug got the same life
Hustle when whether it’s sun down or it’s day light
Jump out the Rover it look like baking Soda
Arm and hammer whip game right
I fuck your bitch on the same night
She ain’t want to leave, had to change flights
I know about that cocaine life
I’m Kurt Cobain when I change sprite
Me and your plug got the same life
Go ask your bitch what I taste like

[Hook]
Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it (bom!)
Cook it, cook it, cook it, cook it
Cook it, cook it, cook it, cook it (ahh!)
Push it, push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it, push it (ain't no way around it)
Cook it, cook it, cook it, cook it
Cook it, cook it, cook it, cook it  (ain't no way around it)
