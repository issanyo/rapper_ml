[Intro]
I'm just tryin' to figure it out
It's a lot comin' with this shit
Lose a lot
Gain a lot

[Verse 1]
Like it's written in Chinese it's hard to read her
I poured an 8th in a liter knocking Aaliyah
It's funny I fell in love with her Instagram
I'm picturing how I'ma fuck her, If I get to meet her
I don't get to nap
What you do for a living?
Shit, my business rap
I'm outta town all the time, let me know if you can get with that
In 5 minutes flat I bag an ounce up, I was in the trap
It's funny that ones that was closest don't even give me dap
You claim you want me, that's something that you just gotta prove
A lot a dudes in Gucci uniforms like it's private school
Crazy me wearing these red-bottoms, done brought 'em out the blue
Young rich nigga, probably find me where Stella got her groove
Feel like I got her, so now I just gotta follow through
She telling me if we was together, I'd have to follow rules
I'mma see you, when I'mma see you, I make a lot of moves
I don't need you but I might keep you
What do I gotta prove?

[Chorus]
Don't nobody know we speaking
Thinkin' 'bout if I should keep it
You could be my little secret
Don't nobody gotta know
Thinkin' 'bout if I should eat it
If I'm workin' then I'm workin'
If I'm creepin' then I'm creepin'
Don't nobody gotta know

[Verse 2]
She said she never heard my music but her brother on it
She got me thinkin' 'bout it if I'ma put a rubber on it
If I ain't wakin' up to her message it's just another mornin'
She really my type because she think love is boring
I don't know if it's the jewelry or the cash
That made her respond to me so fast
She ain't never asked me nothin' 'bout my past
Speeding I'm trying to look through her pictures
I almost crashed
Digital Dash, foreign whip, I took a Florida Trip
Me and my daughter, I'm getting messages from this foreign chick
She keep complimenting my jewelry she think I'm more than rich
So I'ma fuck her wearing my jewelry, I'm on some border shit
Online shopper, she don't go out she just order kicks
I just hope she suck a mean dick and put cheese on her grits
Older women love me the youngins too, I'm running through
I panicked, she ain't post a picture in over a month or two

[Chorus]
Don't nobody know we speaking
Thinkin' 'bout if I should keep it
You could be my little secret
Don't nobody gotta know
Thinkin' 'bout if I should eat it
If I'm workin' then I'm workin'
If I'm creepin' then I'm creepin'
Don't nobody gotta know

[Verse 3]
It's hard to trust' em nowadays
They come with foul ways
Thirsty for satisfaction
She doin' it for a caption
I rather be drunk somewhere relaxin'
I gave six all my jewelry
I don't trust her, he started laughing
Like this the shorty, you been talking bout and showing us
I'm growing up, no more Keishas nigga, I'm blowing up
I don't trust her enough to pass the weed I be rolling up
I could have her on the beach in Belize sipping coconuts
Hood shit, Hennessy shots until she throwing up
Time to see what that mouth 'bout
She already done smoked enough
Telling me with her last Nigga with head is how she woke him up
Wonder why I'm not going to cuff?
Mammie you must be smoking dust

[Chorus]
Don't nobody know we speaking
Thinkin' 'bout if I should keep it
You could be my little secret
Don't nobody gotta know
Thinkin' 'bout if I should eat it
If I'm workin' then I'm workin'
If I'm creepin' then I'm creepin'
Don't nobody gotta know

[Outro]
Don't nobody gotta know
Don't nobody gotta know
Don't nobody gotta know
