[ Verse 1: Dave East]
Waking up to these back shots
Deep strokes
Chanel sneakers Chanel peacoats
First you was shy
You opened up off the weed smoke
First you was scared go down
But now you deep throat
She like to do it to Future music
That Beast Mode
Only post to been a night
She been here for a week though
The head good but watch ya' teeth though
I focused up and knocked it down
Like a free throw
She got her own so
She don’t like when they broke
Good job but in her private time
She like to get dope
Put her to sleep, roll a back
Light up some smoke
She a freak
I already know she like to get chocked
She ain’t even got a weave
I’m pulling it while I go to work
She biting the bed
Ain’t lookin' like she gon’ go to work
Callin’ out, hit it from the side
Had you fallin’ out
Both legs are behind my head
Ain’t no walking out
