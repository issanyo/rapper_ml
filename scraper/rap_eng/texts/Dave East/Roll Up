Chorus:

I told my nigga roll up the window
Roll up the indo
Then we really can't complain
I was living low, couldn't get dough
Niggas giving info
I'm just tryna get this cake
I told my nigga roll up the window
Roll up the indo
Then we really can't complain
I was living low, couldn't get dough
Niggas giving info
I'm just tryna get this cake (to all my niggas)

Verse:

Roll all them windows up no henny cups
We smoking a1, speed low cos the semi tucked
Many blunts it was dutches, thats when I started burning
Switch it back, was my hustle change, we started earning
I met papi, introduced me to girl scout
Your girl love to smoke, thats why I'm in your girl mouth
A couple hits of this will probably turn your world out
Sour to the face, I ain't got nothing to worry about
Greatness, Dave East & Greatness smoking great piff
Afgan kush, of that white widow the basics
Round and round we go, break a pound out to a o
If you got it let me know, my people know i gotta smoke
I fell in love with cali, it's legal to blow the bali
Them clubs in the valley deliver, don't come in baggies
I'm rolling up proudly, getting high, you take a whiff of this
I tried to tell my PO, I can't help it, it's in my piss

Chorus:

I told my nigga roll up the window
Roll up the indo
Then we really can't complain
I was living low, couldn't get dough
Niggas giving info
I'm just tryna get this cake
I told my nigga roll up the window
Roll up the indo
Then we really can't complain
I was living low, couldn't get dough
Niggas giving info
I'm just tryna get this cake (to all my niggas)

Verse:

Smoke like a young Bob Marley, this my party
Rastafari, keep enough for the car ride
I'm waking up and lighting it
Everything exotic, married to this kush, I'm wifing it
Women kissing women, shot gunning, I got em dyking it
Stoned like a statue, so many things that I might forget
Roll your own, I smoke & get to talking, I like to vent
5 pack of sweet cigars, lil still keeps em jawns
Tryna knock me for a p, lawyer good I beat the charge
A don't even smoke, but when I visit, told him keep his card
Sour got me starving, want my drink cold, pizza large
Good with green, I be pulling strings, I don't need guitars
OG Keep me on a cloud, I can see the stars
OG told me smoke papers cos you breathing hard
I ain't got the time to speak
BK niggas roll Bambu with the fantu leaf
No joy like what that ganja bring, love it more than a lot of things

Chorus:

I told my nigga roll up the window
Roll up the indo
Then we really can't complain
I was living low, couldn't get dough
Niggas giving info
I'm just tryna get this cake
I told my nigga roll up the window
Roll up the indo
Then we really can't complain
I was living low, couldn't get dough
Niggas giving info
I'm just tryna get this cake (to all my niggas)
