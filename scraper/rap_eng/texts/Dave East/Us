[Intro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus: Gunna]
Big body Rover and it still came with a sport
Big booty bitches gotta fetish for Dior
Tall glass, better not see the jet when it soar
Double cup of lean, you could smell that codeine in my pores
Keep some extra sticks 'cause any day could be a war
Committedâ€‹ in these streets, I call Dave East when I'm in New York
Takin' care of my fam, I know what I was made for
Look what bein' real and loyalty done gave us

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Look what bein' real and loyalty done gave us
Make a million dollars, niggas say you changed up
Your bitch on my dick now 'cause she know I'm famous
Used to couldn't get in, I get paid at the same club
Prada with no laces, hard to recognize my shoes
Stars inside the Wraith made her feel like she on the moon
No suckers around me, only real ones in the room
I keep it on my body, I don't gotta pay no goon
Backseat of that Maybach, shit be feelin' like a jet
Smokin' cookie, I ain't touch her pussy, but yo' bitch got wet
Got a condo on my neck and on my wrist I got a 'vette
Gunna, Gunna, that's my loc forever, do it for the set
Dirt gang

[Chorus: Gunna]
Big body Rover and it still came with a sport
Big booty bitches gotta fetish for Dior
Tall glass, better not see the jet when it soar
Double cup of lean, you could smell that codeine in my pores
Keep some extra sticks 'cause any day could be a war
Committed in these streets, I call Dave East when I'm in New York
Takin' care of my fam, I know what I was made for
Look what bein' real and loyalty done gave us

[Verse 2: Gunna]
The penthouse paid up, that is a Benz plus
Chains European cut, I'm smokin' real wax
Ridin' 'round with that F&N like I'm on a manhunt
Tryna stretch it 'til the end, couple hunnids through the month
Lot of lean in my cup, I drink clean in that cut
In the club wit' it tucked, run it up like the Bucks
Every other day I get paid for the club
How you never chased yo' bag and they still don't show you love?
I been talkin' to the God and ain't no one else above
See the opps then we gon' slide, hit 'em up 'fore they hit us
Said no you can't divide, family like the Brady Bunch
Couple bad foreigns outside, you already know it's us

[Chorus: Gunna]
Big body Rover and it still came with a sport
Big booty bitches gotta fetish for Dior
Tall glass, better not see the jet when it soar
Double cup of lean, you could smell that codeine in my pores
Keep some extra sticks 'cause any day could be a war
Committed in these streets, I call Dave East when I'm in New York
Takin' care of my fam, I know what I was made for
Look what bein' real and loyalty done gave us
