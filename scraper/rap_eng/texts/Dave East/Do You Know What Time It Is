[Verse 1: Styles P & Dave East]
It's 12AM, I'm late up, watchin' Power
It's 1AM, I just jumped out the shower
It's 2AM, gotta go get some sour
It's 3AM, the club still open
It's 4AM, I'm drunk and I'm still smokin'
It's 5AM, I hit a bitch on camera
It's 6AM, she went and got me a sandwich
It's 7AM, I get up advantage
It's 8AM, I got some shit to manage
It's 9AM, meetings with the hammer
It's 10AM, I caught a duffle lick
It's 11AM, I caught another lick
It's 12PM, I'm 'bout to get a check
Me too, can't talk no money, if you ain't get it yet
Never speak about what we doin', if you ain't did it yet
Fuck your opinion on how we livin', if you ain't live it yet

[Chorus: Styles P & Dave East]
Do you know what time it is, tell me do you know?
Do you know what time it is, it's time to get the dough
They say time is money, that's the only time I know
If you ain't talkin' money, then it's time for you to go
Do you know what time it is, tell me do you know?
Do you know what time it is, it's time to get the dough
They say time is money, that's the only time I know
If you ain't talkin' money, then it's time for you to go

[Verse 2: Dave East & Styles P]
Day time, I'm with the homies, I'm in the juice bar
Night time, I'm in the lab, I'm gettin' loose y'all
Wrong time, I put a blade right through y'all
Right time, I give a hug and throw the deuce y'all
Hype time, I get the hammer and straight shoot y'all
Life time, keepin' it real and bein' too hard
They time, it's keepin' it fake and bein' too soft
My time, always is trill, I keep it true, God
Day time, I'm with my daughter gettin' my father on
Night time, linin' up niggas, gettin' my barber on
Wrong time, middle of the summer with a parka on
Right time, my man want it cheaper, I probably bargain for him
Hype time, jump in the crowd with a deuce deuce on me
Life time, keep me a homie I know gon' shoot for me
They time, tell on they best friends when the cops come
My time, fuck what he talkin' 'bout, let's just rob, son

[Chorus: Styles P & Dave East]
Do you know what time it is, tell me do you know?
Do you know what time it is, it's time to get the dough
They say time is money, that's the only time I know
If you ain't talkin' money, then it's time for you to go
Do you know what time it is, tell me do you know?
Do you know what time it is, it's time to get the dough
They say time is money, that's the only time I know
If you ain't talkin' money, then it's time for you to go
