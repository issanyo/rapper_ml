[Intro]

[Hook]
I be chilling where it ain't safe
[?] got an AK
Everyday's is payday
Think I need a vacay
Never leave my heat home
I'm everywhere the streets know
I live by the G code
Bitch I think I'm Nino
I be chilling where it ain't safe
Cause I got an AK
Everyday's is payday
Think I need a vacay
Never leave my heat home
I'm everywhere the streets know
I live by the G code
Bitch I think I'm Nino

[Verse 1]
I seen a AK before I seen college
I'm destined to shine shit, I just need polish
Uptown with the strap like I'm Rasheed Wallace
'07 did the cargos with the green Pradas
On my Philly shit but my city New Jack
Watching for ice t's was tryna move G pack
Soon as I step out my building, they like I need that
Hajis for dinner, them Chopped Cheese I still eat that
The roof where the D's at, crack, we call him pieces
Flip this, I'm hitting Great Adventure with my nieces
Used to the game, you niggas watching from the bleachers
I'm used to the pain, that's why I kill 'em every feature
How could I not go hard, I come from not much
Grams made the block rush, my grandma would watch us
She probably turning in her grave from all I used to do
I'm a changed man momma, pardon me I'm moving through

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From Nautica jackets to Andrew Martin
Lights in the staircase off, ran through the dark
Pack in his pocket, my homie ran from the narcs
Live how you want but you gotta answer to God
Thou shall not kill, I'm sinning every beat
Running through Harlem, see niggas winning head to feet
I come from the bottom talking places you'll never see
Delivering product just tryna see another week
I'ma monster, something like the Lochness
Signed my deal and went from the label to the projects
[?] told me Fleek, kill these niggas, do it properly
So I'ma let the family, let the reverend, and the doctor meet
When G Money hit the pipe, he started slipping
Put Pookie in position, Nino somewhere chilling
Had to shut the carter down, so good the block before I park it
I ain't bitching, I'm just cautious now, the streets watching

[Hook]

[Outro]
