[Intro: Lana Del Rey]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best

[Verse 1: Bcrizzy]
Nothing more stressful than dealing with a painful past
Feeling depressed getting home from work drinking at 10 past
In this world it’s you on your own, more snakes and less bulls
So i just feed em by the spoonful
These fakes just disappear when the breeze blow
I’m tryna survive I count the zeros
Used to beg for money couldn’t find happiness
Now i’m successful they thought they could finesse
I stay classy invite them to play chess
I told my mom I only want to give her the best
Anyone tryna flex
If not I got and extra clip
For that bullshit
This man jelz gotta toss them answers
He doing questionable shit
Man we live in a cold world I’m on my canuck shit
Crazy it’s crizzy
Im back again
I got this

[Hook: Lana Del Rey]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
Baby you're the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I was born in the summer
Malik died in the summer
It get live in the summer
Head to Brooklyn, I'm knocking this Bobby Shmurda in my G-Stars
Free my GS9 niggas, throw Rowdy on and breeze off
Since a rookie shooting like Ray Allen in that 3-4
When he was a Milwaukee Buck
Not whispering, I'm talking up, look
I can't be worried about ISIS, my life is trifling
Affording dollar slices, just praying they don't indight us
Keeping both my fists raised up, I'm like the fighting Irish
Had molly sales at Notre Dame, when ain't nobody know my name
Remember giving cane out, remember all the misses giving brain out
Remember when Fab was spelling his name out
Before I bought the foreigns, took the train route
When Cam had that pink Range out
It was Reggie, wasn't no paint out
Vegas nights, sky dweller Rollie look like a Vegas light
Was tryna pitch an eighth of white
Just to go eat some steak and rice
I know you hate this life, jeweler acting nervous tryna break the ice
I love red bottoms but really hate the spikes
It's sad
