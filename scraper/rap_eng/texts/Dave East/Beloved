Beloved Styles (Ghost)
Beloved East (East)
Beloved New York streets where we run around (what up?!)
I'm in love with dirty cash and I'm used to livin' fast
But I could kick it to the moon when the sun around
I'm from the Empire State and I'm high as the state building
Beloved, I have no plans of comin' down (nuh uh)
Beloved, I got you covered, no fingerprints, rubber gloved
And nothin' to discussin', my niggas gon' hunt you down
Beloved, the meanin' of friend, lets eat to the ends
Split the plate and tell the plug can't wait to see you again
Money the root of evil, I want all my demons to spend (all of 'em)
Don't panic, you in that water, I just need you to swim (swim, nigga)

Beloved, I been rugged since the four finger nugget
Had a cocaine budget then a rap one
The bodega they call me Da-vie
Gun by the Hi-C, you cross one of us I'm gon' clap sum'n
Now my baby brother's a C-M, my other homie's a B but me I'm just a G that came to wrap somethin'
These pills got these youngins buggin', you'll die for a hunnid-somethin'
So act like you love your life and just relax, cousin
Beloved, I been thuggin' since Carmelo played for the Nuggets
Made a deal with the plug before the label came with a budget
Now the biggest haters I got, they used to say we was cousins
Came from the dungeon, you say you got cocaine, we can cut it

B-E-L-O-V-E-D, cut poison like B-B-D
Four dimes like D-V-D, from Yonkers to C-P-T
Got my G-E-D in the county, runnin' from T-N-T
The pussy free but the crack costs, word to the B-D-P
They was aight but now they washed, legs weaker than C-P-3
Clutchin' the grip, I ghostride the whip, I'm Keak da Sneak
Yeah, T-H-C, C-B-D oil, I get the geek
Not Milwaukee but I get to the bucks like the Greek Freak
Beep-beep, foreign creep, knockin' Gangster and Gentlemen for a week
Think about what you sayin' before you speak
Knee deep, can't sleep, paranoia on the streets
I'm just gettin' high, playin' Paranoia on the beach, yeah
