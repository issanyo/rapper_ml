[Intro: DJ Drama]
*breathing*
You hear that?
It's a breath of fresh air

[Verse 1: Dave East and (DJ DRAMA)]
Arguing over status, I'm talking static
In Harlem we all are savage
No problem to park in traffic
Off the package, walk ya palace
Leave 'em walking backward
Juice bar visits for walking backwards
Shots to rip apart your mattress
Like Keenan Ivory all my brothers get chicken
Picking bitches to pitch it, come get it, we live expensive
Get tickets, never paid attention, get warrants, fuck it
Like fuck the district, piss on a prescient
Gun is heavy you couldn't lift it
Cruise like Penelope, jealousy I could taste it
Call up Sav for the cases, no talking feel like a mason
Illuminati in my mind, soul, and my body
Post up in ya mother lobby, a couple bricks from Papi
Niggas talking 'bout they got it, bet you all them niggas broke
Treat em like an eighth of sour I get all them niggas smoked
Took a picture if they sniffers I get all them bitches coke
Play the center tryna ball I'll knock 'em off right in the post

[Hook: Makarel]
I swear them streets made me
I'm grinding hard like the 80's
I swear the shit that drive you crazy, oh baby
I'm just getting to it clocking in for the money
'Cause I remember days when a nigga stayed bummy
Now the all the hoes on my dick, now the shit is funny
But honestly all they get is dick from me

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Black and red Jordan Sixes, a couple Florida bitches
Asking niggas to clip 'em couldn't afford the biscuit
Had enough for some chicken couldn't afford the biscuit
Seen a body drop right in front of me, made me more religious
Order pigeons that's bird, sat by the curb
Lot of foreigns we swerve, older bitches say I curve
My word, I got that hustle in me
These little niggas is shooting, not tryna knuckle with me
Back block with an old smith and a couple 50s
Tryna get it true Harlem nigga I love the city
Water pitcher niggas move Dasani
We got ya building on fire you better move ya mommy
Your GPS can't locate me it take a crew to find me
80s baby grew in the 90s fuck Giuliani
Made a couple thousand and blew it, I bet I make it back
Sell the whole thing take straight cash and make it stack
Sleep on the guard if you're tired I'll help you take a nap

[Hook: Makarel and (Dave East)]
I swear them streets made me
I'm grinding hard like the 80's
I swear the shit that drive you crazy, oh baby
I'm just getting to it clocking in for the money
'Cause I remember days when a nigga stayed bummy
Now the all the hoes on my dick, now the shit is funny
But honestly all they get is dick from me
