[Intro]
A man means you never give up
Gotta toughen up in your heart
Toughen up!

[Chorus: Millyz]
I raised myself up as a man, ambition in my soul
Couple dollars in my hands, kick knowledge in my goals, whoa
I raised myself up as a man, ambition in my soul
Couple dollars in my hands, kick knowledge in my goals, whoa

[Verse 1: Millyz]
Look, dope game my life
Cocaine my wife
Fist fights as a young boy, I got blood all on my Nikes
Three dice, an affair wit' it
Mom deuced, couldn't deal wit' it
Pop dukes in the boondocks on the dumb shit and I'm still wit' it
See, Marvin, my mind gone
Teen years was a time bomb
Cross me, I came back shootin', they lookin' at me like I'm wrong
Still switchin' these time zones
Codeine on a long flight
Mecca died at sixteen, at fifteen it was all white, right
This shit been gettin' spooky, brah
I light my loosie up and stay away from Lucifer
Illuminati wit' my mind, soul, and body
I saw my mommy and it's obvious

[Chorus: Millyz]
I raised myself up as a man, ambition in my soul
Couple dollars in my hands, kick knowledge in my goals, whoa
I raised myself up as a man, ambition in my soul
Couple dollars in my hands, kick knowledge in my goals, whoa

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Fourteen, I was tryna smoke
Fifteen, I was playin' ball
Sixteen, learned how to roll at the dice game, I take it all
Seventeen, I skipped states, went down South for a short stay
Eighteen, couldn't find work so I caught the bus hit broadway
Nineteen, I did the school thing
Me and Pops always had beef
Turned twenty, seen friends switch
Twenty one up in the Benz kit
Twenty two, I did six months, fucked most of my friendships
Twenty three, I was gettin' nice, city knew what my name was
Twenty four, I played the trap spot, 24/7, we ain't play clubs
Twenty five, that's when Freaky died
Twenty six, I was xan'd out
Drop back rows, niggas woke up, bust Bully free, my man out
Twenty seven wit' a Mac-11
Where I'm from you gotta have a weapon
Harlem

[Chorus: Millyz]
I raised myself up as a man, ambition in my soul
Couple dollars in my hands, kick knowledge in my goals, whoa
I raised myself up as a man, ambition in my soul
Couple dollars in my hands, kick knowledge in my goals, whoa
I raised myself up as a man, ambition in my soul
Couple dollars in my hands, kick knowledge in my goals, whoa
