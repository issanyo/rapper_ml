[Intro: TEC]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, turn up, turn up
Yeah, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: TEC]
We gon' pull up with them poles, let ’em hold somethin'
Nigga feel like he want smoke, let me know somethin'
When we catch him, we gon’ bless him like his nose runnin'
Finesse came with a whole hundred, no stock but I'll fold somethin'
Let off shots on they block, let 'em hold somethin'
Money I drop on an opp, let 'em hold somethin', yeah
Let off shots on they block, let ’em hold somethin’
Money I drop on an opp, let 'em hold somethin’

[Verse 1: TEC]
Whole lot of bodies, whole lot of homis, whole lot of rap guns
Never spare nothin'
Bitch, I'm out the nation like I'm Farrakhan
One up on Lil Lu, I pile on you and shoot the fat one
I’ma pull up shootin' everyone
With this drum, could produce an album, yeah
Cut my dog, fuck that talkin', bitch, go smoke somethin'
That was 1 o'clock, nigga's body dropped around 4 somethin'
Scope somethin'
Came with the knife, poke somethin'
I got the driver, his loads comin'
We pull up and rob all the dope from 'em, yeah
We do this shit with no effort
And it ain't shit you could tell us
Booked up on shows, we don't look at the schedule
Do this for Zo, I'ma bring 'em that pressure, yeah
Diamonds in my Rollie bezel
All of these hoes make me feel like Hugh Hefner
I'm on gelato, shit strong as Brock Lesnar
K and a nine on me, no German Shepard, no
I fell in love with that Wockhardt
Had to sneak me a pint through the airport
'Fore I pour it out, I'll go to jail for it
Walkin' through TSA, always paranoid
They say my pockets on steroids
Big ass house, Uncle Elroy
I declare war, ain't no fair warnin'
Niggas know we comin', just prepare for it

[Chorus: TEC]
We gon' pull up with them poles, let 'em hold somethin'
Nigga feel like he want smoke, let me know somethin'
When we catch him, we gon' bless him like his nose runnin'
Finesse came with a whole hundred, no stock but I'll fold somethin'
Let off shots on they block, let 'em hold somethin'
Money I drop on an opp, let 'em hold somethin', yeah
Let off shots on they block, let 'em hold somethin'
Money I drop on an opp, let 'em hold somethin'

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Whole lot of robberies
We want them chains, then rings, and we want them watches
Not just a rapper, niggas is actors, need to go get 'em an Oscar
I jump out and hit 'em in Prada
Couple young dread niggas with me like Shottas
Get hit with this drum, you might lose a lung
It's gon' be too late for a doctor
Too late for a nurse
Told mama I'm sorry, I used to take change out her purse
Eat up like mob, if he gotta die, my niggas arrangin' it first
Catch a body, take a Vegas trip
Lately I been in the latest shit
If you ain't with it, why you say this shit?
That's a free body, they ain't pay him shit
Throw it at him, let him hold somethin'
Back and forth, I'm a roadrunner
She sniff a lot, it got her nose runnin'
You say my name, a hundred hoes comin'
You say my name, the plug pullin' up
I smuggled her out while you with a cup
You can't come around, you ain't hood enough
Do this for the set, yeah, my hood is up
I dropped a backend on some ice
That's your wife, she come around me, I would've fucked
Came up off a package, I'm with an actress
You can't believe Meagan Good with us
I got a thing for them blue strips
I fell in love with them bands
I don't know who got a problem
I pulled up with a hundred poles in the van

[Chorus: TEC]
We gon' pull up with them poles, let 'em hold somethin'
Nigga feel like he want smoke, let me know somethin'
When we catch him, we gon' bless him like his nose runnin'
Finesse came with a whole hundred, no stock but I'll fold somethin'
Let off shots on they block, let 'em hold somethin'
Money I drop on an opp, let 'em hold somethin', yeah
Let off shots on they block, let 'em hold somethin'
Money I drop on an opp, let 'em hold somethin'

[Outro: TEC]
AR-15 with the beam, a big old somethin'
Rockin' lecture or check through the bitch, I'll explode somethin', boom
Heard you rattin', lil' nigga, you told somethin'
Four-five under my coat, somethin'
Tried to run, I took his soul from him
