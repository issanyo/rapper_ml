[Intro]
Rocking with my niggas
What else? Rocking with my niggas
East side, I was broke
I was broke

[Verse 1]
I was broke tryna get some smoke
Hustling in the snow, drinking Henny, now I'm on a boat talking price of coke
I'm a fool, when I'm off a Perc they say I do the most
Trying to get high on the tram cause all he does is float
Private jet, just me and my gang, luggage on a G5
Ain't no 7 but I keep a weapon, started with a .35
Now I'm up in Neimans buying, Balmain like it's Levi
I don't pop no Xannie, them Percocet's had me tree high
Never ran, I have better grams, fiends ain't hate to beg
Seen a smoker hit the pipe and watch 'em do the stanky leg
Paid in full, I'm a raging bull, these niggas overdose
All these niggas rocking Bape, I really been to Tokyo
Where I'm from they smoking dope until they catch the holy ghost
Crib out in the Poconos, pockets full of provolone
My life is a movie, you the trailer, that's a mobile home
Feds be in our area, don't talk crazy on mobile phones
Ravenswood in the hood so long, I start to hate the hood
Me and Kung had Charlie pack, my bitch look like Megan Good
My bitch look like J-Lo, shrimp alfredo on some mob shit
Gambino my posture, I play dead like possum
My young'n busting head, he got dreads but not no rasta
I don't do no deals, just tell 'em the label will be partners
Versace on my boxers, no I don't shop at Target
Might have still been cool with you if you believe it when I start it

[Hook]
I'm in the bank dropping off deposits
Balmain jeans, I don't rock no Robins
We shooting first, that's just how I'm rocking
These Margielas, I don't rock no Pradas

[Verse 2]
That's on my mama, y'all don't want no problems
I come from the gutter, now I eat butter on lobster
You be hanging with scholars, I'm with jack boys and them gualas
Pulling up in Impalas, diss me, I ain't responding
Niggas living on Instagram, can't pay rent with them comments
I'm midtown with a couple lawyers tryna add a couple more commas
Drama hosted my last tape, I'm so familiar with drama
Fuck the world with no condom, I fuck your girl then I'm sliding

[Bridge]
I was broke tryna get some smoke
Hustling in the snow, drinking Henny, now I'm on a boat talking price of coke
I'm a fool, when I'm off a Perc they say I do the most
Tryna ride my wave in tram, bitch all I do is float
I was broke tryna get some smoke
Hustling in the snow, drinking Henny, now I'm on a boat talking price of coke
I'm a fool, when I'm off a Perc they say I do the most
Tryna ride my wave in drown, bitch all I do is float

[Hook]
I'm in the bank dropping off deposits
Balmain jeans, I don't rock no Robins
We shooting first, that's just how I'm rocking
These Margielas, I don't rock no Pradas
I'm in the bank dropping off deposits
Balmain jeans, I don't rock no Robins
We shooting first, that's just how I'm rocking
These Margielas, I don't rock no Pradas
