(Hook)
I float through the streets like a ghost
I have dreams of me driv’in a ghost (ghost)
They owe, them niggas get ghosted
The reason these niggas get smoked (smoke)
Came up in the hood I was broke
No crack dealer to sell at them soap (rope)
Hundreds of dollars of smoke this the life that I know (Ah!)

I float through the streets like a ghost
I have dreams of me driv’in a ghost (ghost)
They owe them niggas get ghosted
The reason these niggas get smoked (brrr)
Came up in the hood I was broke
No crack dealer to sell at them soap (yeah)
Hundreds of dollars of smoke this the life that I know (I know)

I float through the streets like a ghost
I have dreams of me driv’in a ghost (ghost)
They owe them niggas get ghosted
The reason these niggas get smoked (smoke)
Came up in the hood I was broke
No crack dealer to sell at them soap (Ah!)
Hundreds of dollars of smoke this the life that I know (Uh!)

(Verse 1: Dave East)
Talk about murder she wrote
I grew up around burners and coke
Young’in get murdered for less
R-I-P to hundred sixth street still curb’in these hoes
Pull up on hundredth and ninth
I’m wild’in, I’m like fuck ya advice
Streets will just fuck up your life
Drunk I just might fuck you wife
Been zipp’in them butter all night, hugg’in the pipe
Just dipp’in through Jersey
On my way to Delaware
Bone crusher motherfucker I ain’t never scared
I hear you repen’in them other block but you ain’t never there
Louis-V on my waist plus the metal there
Couple rats in the street straight drug money
I can’t blow it all tonight just to plug money
At ’99 my iceberg was all Bugs Bunny
Lose your life for a bag that’s blood money
Blue rag on the bag that’s Cuz money
Laugh’in at him while we shoot ‘cuz he was funny
In a tub with a young bitch
40 cal by the toilet, right under the towel
Couple hollow tips all up in the barrel
I guarantee she ain’t go’in to be on her dumb shit
Pump piff on the block, where the coke at?
Seen them chips, started eat’in nigga food ‘cuz he spoke back

(Hook)
I float through the streets like a ghost
I have dreams of me driv’in a ghost (ghost)
They owe them niggas get ghosted
The reason these niggas get smoked (Ba!)
Came up in the hood I was broke
No crack dealer to sell at them soap (yeah)
Hundreds of dollars of smoke this the life that I know
(life that we know nigga)

I float through the streets like a ghost
I have dreams of me driv’in a ghost (Uh Yeah!)
They owe them niggas get ghosted
The reason these niggas get smoked
Came up in the hood I was broke
No crack dealer to sell at them soap
Hundreds of dollars of smoke this the life that I know

(Verse 2: Dave East)
Uh, pockets feel just like the bank
Gutter go roll up a stank (stank)
No limit, pull up in her tank
Addicted to bitches and dank
Fuck what you think!
Always go’in up in my rank
I want that house by the lake
Not tak’in no brakes
Public hous’in I hate
Them roaches was all in our place
Had her fucked over
Black la costra nostra
Hopped out the hooptie and coast ya
Some blood for my soldiers
I ride for my culture so don’t even try to get close-ta
Pan Amera is my favorite
Niggas is changing they see I’m go’in to make it
Ain’t give me nothing I figured I take it
Cut my an onion I’m about to get faded
Get to the clip and them bitches get naked
Dodger fans, run down on a nigga like Rodimus
Go flow, egg one, that’s a lot of bread
Publishing Xanax cover lot of meds
Cargos on couple rocks in’em
Brand new Tims I ain’t wore yet
Walking up 1st with the packs flipping
Kush loud like they bagged it up in Nordkoreas  (Lighter!)

(Hook)
I float through the streets like a ghost

They owe them niggas get ghosted
The reason these niggas get smoked

Came up in the hood I was broke
No crack dealer to sell at them soap

Hundreds of dollars of smoke this the life that I know (this is the life that I know)

This is the life that I know
