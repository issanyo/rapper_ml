[Bridge: Anthony Flammia]
I knock it down
We so high, we so high
I could drown in between your thighs, in your thighs
Put you to sleep, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye
I'm in your dreams, in the velvet sky, velvet sky

[Hook: Anthony Flammia]
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet
In your velvet sky

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Blunt smoking, gun totin'
Uptown living, pound flippin'
Now they on me 'cause I sound different
You ain't used to water, you could drown swimmin'
Money come and money go and buss' it open
Bands on me, told 'em buss' it [?]
Sippin' champagne, thuggin', smokin'
We ain't getting [?], niggas must be jokin'
Yellow bone body fat as shit
We ain't got [?] they crashed the whip
To the face, I ain't asking shit
In the whip, smell like half a brick
Speeding past the cops, I ain't pullin' over
Sour diesel once the kush is sober
Pull off in a drop in this foreign nigga
And [?] on the block then I'm tourin' nigga

[Bridge: Anthony Flammia]
We so high, we so high
I could drown in between your thighs, in your thighs
Put you to sleep, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye
I'm in your dreams, in the velvet sky, velvet sky
I knock it down
We so high, we so high
I could drown in between your thighs, in your thighs
Put you to sleep, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye
I'm in your dreams, in the velvet sky, velvet sky

[Hook: Anthony Flammia]
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet sky
In your velvet
In your velvet sky

[Verse 2: Anthony Flammia]
So you gon' grind it up on me?
Ooh baby, don't play around
Girl take your time with me
Say, all that ass on me
Drop it down on me
I give you that pump, pump, pump
And I like that pussy down on me
Say, never met a nigga like me
Never met a girl like you
Wait 'til I give you this sss
Gonna make that sss say "ooh ooh"
Say, you know what to do
Ooh baby, come through
You rollin' round from side to side
If you down to ride, it's alright

[Bridge: Anthony Flammia]
I knock it down
We so high, we so high
I could drown in between your thighs, in your thighs
Put you to sleep, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye
I'm in your dreams, in the velvet sky, velvet sky
I knock it down
We so high, we so high
I could drown in between your thighs, in your thighs
Put you to sleep, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye
I'm in your dreams, in the velvet sky, velvet sky
