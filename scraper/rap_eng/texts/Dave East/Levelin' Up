[Intro: Dave East & DJ Holiday]
Karma 2
What's up my nigga Fab
Oh DJ Holiday
Real nigga music
I got the grip in the trunk
I fill up a tank (FACTS!), then I fill up a blunt

[Chorus: Dave East]
As I get on the road, I fill up the tank (tank)
Then I fill up a blunt (roll up)
I got the grip in the trunk
No, I'm not a trick but she get what she want (yeah)
I keep her right in the cut, we be low in the back, put my niggas in front (we be low)
She could do tricks with her tongue
I used to switch up my bitch every month
Yeah, she call me, I'm picking her up
I've been in motion, I ain't hit in a month
Probably could get any chick that I want
If I'm in a rush, let me hit in the truck, yeah
I used to get on the train and I used to get on the bus (get on the bus)
I used to meet women that never would talk
Now they just begging to fuck
I'm levelling up
Out of your brain, these niggas insane think they better than us
Making sure I stay ahead of the rush
Keep it pushing, I would never give up
Levelling up
Out of your brain, these niggas insane think they better than us
Upper class shit, that never was us

[Verse 1: Dave East]
A hundred bags, got ahead off of dust
A hundred bags, got ahead off of kush
She is school, got her head in the books
NARCs raided but I never was shook
Them indictments, got a federal look
We hit the kitchen, like he better go cook
Them niggas shook, they ain't never gon' look
Been this man from a young nigga locin'
Get around her, shit get wet like the ocean
Been on my shit
I got a bitch out in Cali and I got a chick in a six
I got an F, so I can't go and visit and 90% of my homies is Crip
I get up and go, I touched alot of this paper, I know how it feel to be broke
Know how it feel to do time in the system, feel like you don't know which way you 'bout to go
I got back to my glow, yeah I got back to my shine
These diamonds attracting these dimes, I done relapsed 'bout 200 times
Got caught with a pack, had to move out my mom's
Freeky died, I thought I'm losing my mind
Mugga died, I thought I'm losing my feelings
I don't know nothing, I know how to grind
I got a deal, trapping right out my building
Hundreds they got me so open I hang out the window like Joker
I had to get cool with the smokers (had too)
I had to get cool with the fiends
Make moves with the players, have talks with the coaches (talk)
I had to make trips to the Tropics, wake up to the model just sipping Mimosas (models)
I had to get back to the projects, the reason you gotta watch how you approach us

[Chorus: Dave East]
As get on the road, I fill up the tank (tank)
Then I fill up a blunt (fill it up)
I got the grip in the trunk
No, I'm not a trick but she get what she want (uhh)
I keep her right in the cut, we be low in the back, put my niggas in front (we be low)
She could do tricks with her tongue
I used to switch up my bitch every month
Yeah, she call me, I'm picking her up
I've been in motion, I ain't hit in a month
Probably could get any chick that I want
If I'm in a rush, let me hit in the truck, yeah
I used to get on the train and I used to get on the bus (get on the bus)
I used to meet women that never would talk
Now they just begging to fuck
I'm levelling up
Out of your brain, these niggas insane think they better than us
Making sure I stay ahead of the rush
I keep it pushing, I would never give up
Levelling up
Out of your lane, these niggas insane think they better than us
Upper class shit, that never was us
Throwing cash, bitch you never gon' fuck
My cheddar is up

[Interlude: Fabolous & DJ Holiday]
I mean what else we gon' do
Holiday Season
The best part about coming from the bottom
Is there ain't no place you can go but up

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
New levels bring new devils, never let it turn you devil
Call them plays so the team win, Coach K to my Blue Devils
They was transporters like Jason Statham
Now they ball like Jayson Tatum, my Grant Hills' gettin' hand deals
My J.J. Redick's got flooded Pateks
Chasing millions in my Jason Williams
My Jabari Parker is a 'Rari parker
Late looks from my Kyries, my play book's like a diary
You playa haters won't never see it
You clout chasers won't ever be it
Double-cross me, won't ever three it
Decided I'ma just Heavy D it, and tell them niggas
Got nothing but love for you, baby
Got nothing but love
Peep shit, take notes, fall back, move different
Just me, my fam, my dog, Stew Griffin
More growth, level ups, new look, tooth fixing
Big smile, outchea, we here, you missing

[Interlude 2: Dave East]
I'm levelling up
These niggas insane think they better than us

[Chorus: Dave East]
As get on the road, I fill up the tank (tank)
Then I fill up a blunt (roll up)
I got the grip in the trunk
No, I'm not a trick but she get what she want (yeah)
I keep her right in the cut, we be low in the back, put my niggas in front (we be low)
She could do tricks with her tongue
I used to switch up my bitch every month
Yeah, she call me, I'm picking her up
I've been in motion, I ain't hit in a month
Probably could get any chick that I want
If I'm in a rush, let me hit in the truck, yeah
I used to get on the train and I used to get on the bus (get on the bus)
I used to meet women that never would talk
Now they just begging to fuck
I'm levelling up
