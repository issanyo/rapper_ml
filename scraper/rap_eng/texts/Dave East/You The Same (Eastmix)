[Intro]
Paranoia 2 on the way
That's what I will say
Uh

[Chorus]
You the same
You the same
You the same
Project bitches tell me you the same
Brand new wrist with a newer chain
Running through Atlanta like I'm Gucci Mane
Red beam really helped the Ruger aim
Fuck the neighbors I don't care who complain
Double G to the socks, real Gucci Gang
Faded, hard to understand me like I'm pooty tang yeah

[Verse 1]
Let a shot go while the bass bump
Getting head pulling on her lace front
I was in a cell almost 8 months (facts)
You ain't jack boy, you ain't take nothing (nothin)
Moncler on me when it's cold out
If me and (?) out, then the hoes out
Diamonds in the crib brought the gold out
He ain't got a strip, brought the pole out (pole)
Paranoia 2 on the way though
I remember we ain't had no cable
I was in the trap, me and Drayno
Headshot, your dad had a halo
Me and Fab freshest in New York
I ain't really gotta talk, nigga move when I say so (move)
Walk up in Lex with my .40
I know they gonna be on me if I try to hide this Draco
I heard the book was good but the movie ain't
We rollin' on this side, don't care who you bang
You the same
You the same
You the same
The homies on the block tell me you the same
Me homie he a awk, he don't do the gangs
My other homie squad, all he do is bang
Wifey get a spot, but a groupie can't
Got the key to streets they think they hearing Lucy saying
Taliban
Taliban
Taliban
Your main bitch tell you she ain't have a man
I'll rob you in the trap, I ain't have a gram
Wasn't thinking about no rap, I ain't have a plan
They wonderin' what bitch I'mma get next (next)
Hardest in my town since Dipset (Harlem)
Jumpin' in the crowd, get your bitch wet
I ain't fucking with the fam, that's incest
Plug sent the weight, I'mma benchpress
Patek like I cleaned it in Windex
I already fucked you, hit ya friend next
10k to walk through, I probably spent that
I just wanna know where the Benz at
I just wanna know where my Crips at
You would never find out where the kid at
Gelato got me stuck, where my spliff at?
You would never find out where the strap at
My bitch got pills in her backpack (xannies)
In Butch crib where we trapped at
Pieces on me in the booth, that's crack rap (pieces)
We was in the buildin with the new heat
New plug, old plug, took two weeks (too long)
Nowadays I rap like Kool G, walk in the club with a mac in my Gucci
The cops follow us like terrorists
I ain't have shit it was embarrassing
Gucci dropped new shoes need a pair of them
Put 'em on one time, never wear again
Beat it up twice then I fall back
Eat it all night, no call back
Smack him with the gun, he won't talk back
Smack him with the gun, he won't talk back
Beat it up twice then I fall back
Eat it all night, no call back
Smack him with the gun, he won't talk back
Smack him with the gun, he won't talk back

[Outro]
You the same
You the same
You the same
Project bitches tell me you the same
All my real niggas tell me you the same
Project bitches tell me you the same
All my real niggas tell me you the same
Project bitches tell me you the same
All my real niggas tell me you the same
Yeah I got money but you the same
He ain't got the money but you the same
