[Hook: Dave East]
I got a bitch that's going to do what I tell her
Stay in the bank, I’m good with the teller
Bitch I'm a King, you not Correta
I got a bag, get the drop on whoever
I got them diamonds that look like I'm selling
Nothing about me don’t look like I'm telling
Asked her if she ever fucked with a felon
I can really put a dime on your melon

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Dead broke like I need a lick
Grey sweatpants, she can see the print
We be moving on some sneaky shit
I can't leave until she eat the dick
She falling in love too easy
I'm just in love with the pussy
I got too much money to count
I be smoking gelato or cookies
Prada my hoodie
Prada my sweats
Prada my sneakers
And Prada my socks
Handcuffin' homie you are a cop
Bend her over have her calling her job
Hittas with me like I'm part of the Mob
Frontin' on us, then you outta get robbed
Knock em down if they part of the squad
100 thou I can ball in Dubai

[Hook: Dave East]
I got a bitch that's going to do what I tell her
I stay in the bank, I’m good with the teller
Bitch I’m a King, you not Correta
I got bag, get the drop on whoever
I touched a million, I'm tryna get more
Trap by building, we trap by the store
All I wanted was a Bentley Azure
Thug Life like I’m Mr. Shakur

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
[?] I'm a star, plus I'm raw with it
She praying to God I go raw with it
I'm fucking the shit out the bank teller
I’m sippin' the shit out this drank Yella
Straps on me like some Margielas
I'ma Mob nigga like the Goodfellas
I never panic when I feel the pressure
I'm bustin' at you if you come aggressive
See I come straight out the block
Now a nigga in the Forbes now
10 thou for verse
I be blowing money when I'm bored now
She gon fuck with me just cause I'm worth something
I'm tryna duck her cause that bitch worth something
Yeah, I got a bitch that's gon do what I ask her
You a little pussy boy, you not a factor

[Hook: Dave East]
I got a bitch that's going to do what I tell her

Nothing about me don't look like I'm telling
