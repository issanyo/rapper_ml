[Hook: Dave East]
I just hit your bitch from a DM
If I get this work off cop a BM
Outside from the AM to the PM
Don’t be scared baby holler when you see him
My cousin had to turn himself in
We was trying to get it we didn’t really know the outcome
Couple homies got acquitted I ain’t here to tell their business I was on a down South Run
I just hit your bitch from the DM
If I get this work off cop a BM
Outside from the AM to the PM
Don’t be scared nigga holler when you see him
My cousin had to turn himself in
We was trying to get it we didn’t really know the outcome
I was paranoid .45 in my hand looking out the window like Malcolm

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Take it straight to the trap when the ounce come
Old dimes ringing up when the ounce done
Probably take it to the club when my count done
All these niggas getting quiet when the loud come
Smoking dope, I’m a fiend
I don’t dream much but I know I’m a king
My city don’t sleep, you don’t know what I seen
They offer you 5
We know you gonna sing J Reid, nigga
Talking to the cops then he
Hopping out of vans like the A-Team, nigga
He went from the block to estate cream, nigga
Sweating in a box, no AC, nigga
But back to the streets, I ain’t hard to find
I’m the 2015 Karlton Hines
Bad bitch, she with me, Homie pardon mine
My cousin had a [scott?] tailing his [?] 9
I just hit your bitch from a DM
Oops my bad I think it was your BM
All this sour just been fucking up my breathin’
I got some youngins that hustlin’ from the precin(ct)
Pull up with a mac, not no Apple
They ask me why you in the trap, you a rapper
Let a nigga cross me like a pastor
Watch a nigga get stomped like a [capper?]

[Hook]
I just hit your bitch from a DM
If I get this work cop a BM
Outside from the AM to the PM
Don’t be scared baby holler when you see him
My cousin had to turn himself in
We was trying to get it we didn’t really know the outcome
Couple homies got acquitted I ain’t hit it since they [?] South Run
I just hit your bitch from the DM
If I get this work off cop a BM
Outside from the AM to the PM
Don’t be scared nigga holler when you see him
My cousin had to turn himself in
We was trying to get it we didn’t really know the outcome
I was paranoid .45 in my hand looking out the window like Malcolm

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Staring out my window at the world
My back to the wall, head to the sky
Trying to get some brand new schmoney
Got a Playboy Bunny keep leaving me emoji eyes
Then she took it straight to the DM
Now I’m getting face from a DM
I’m just trying to race in a BM
Telling a friend I can’t wait til I see him
Nigga stock going up
Bad batch of work seen a fiend throwing up
Vacate, take a bitch to Cabo to fuck
I remember days I would ride on a bus
I remember days waking up getting drunk
Bagging up [Hatians?] smell like cat piss
I fucked an actress I won’t say her name
A couple years ago I was not paying taxes
Gotta preach what you practice
Instagram make it easy to get the drop
Her drawers came off easy up in the spot
Kept saying I look like Chris Breezy, got me hot
I just got some head off an IG
[Listening in a dazed love, try me]?
I said she wasn’t with it, she said try me
Then she put me on with her best friend Molly
