[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Shorty was feeling me from the gate
All about my money and violence, feeling like rafe
I just won a few million, filling the safe
Hard to catch feeling if I ain't feeling your face
I be in the projects watching out how the game switch
All my youngins â€˜cane pitch, i just wanna vanquish
Pick you up around seven, just have your bag ready
Skin soft, lift her she light but damn that ass heavy
She chose me and I ain't even have to say much
She like it when I don't gotta cut, ain't get no shape up
Now she got a trainer, just tryna make sure her shape up
Hate it when I hit it and leave, she wanna lay up
She the only one I'm texting when I'm drunk
Take the Lexus to the trump, we naked rolling blunts
Soon as I got her a squad hatin'
She don't know if it ain't about no liquor I'm not chasing

[Hook: Floyd Miles]
I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me
What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave
I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me
What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave

[Verse 2: Floyd Miles]
And I don't know what to tell you nigga
She was choosing when she walked passed
[?] tell you nigga
That you really need to fall back
Yeah I know that you love that girl, you want that girl
But it's she chose me
You can't love these girls
Sorry you gotta learn that from me
And I really can't say that I'm sorry
[?]
We ain't get here by mistake [?]
[?] too late [?]

[Hook: Floyd Miles]
I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me
What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave
I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me
What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I was thinking Cancun, few trucks without the top
Sand in my shorts, feet out without the socks
Crystal clear water, no more order from cops
On a world tour just screaming [?] block
Keep it realer than most, that's if she want it or not
Before I had a key to the crib, she left it unlocked
Chanel what she into
Look her in her eyes, I can tell what you been through
She deserve a Benz Coop
She saw me from across the room
I be at the main event spots where it be hard to move
I make it look easy, doing shit that's hard to do
Coming from the bottom, I be high enough to walk the moon
She my little sweet thang, I just want a taste
Used to doing bottles but tonight I want a case
Bag a couple models, that's just how I start my day
I don't mean to be rude, your shorty looking this way

[Hook: Floyd Miles]
I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me
What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave
I don't mean to be rude but your bitch chose me
What's a nigga gon' do, she don't wanna leave
