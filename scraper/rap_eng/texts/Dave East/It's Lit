[Intro: Styles P]
You hear that?
Run

[Verse 1: Styles P & Dave East]
Gucci seats in the 6 series, Louis seats in the 7 series
Picked up East on the East, hit Madison to shop
Keep the ratty 'cause I’m still leery
Hail Mary, I fucked over good people like Madoff
Smack 'em with the pistol, if I shoot, I'm goin’ away, dawg
Bricks at the Sheridan, pounds at the Aloft
It's fucked up, but Donald Trump is the new Adolf
Work at the Days Inn, never took a day off
Little homie a buck fifty, he gon' let the 'K off
We be spendin' dope money, stuntin' at the playoffs
You be beggin' for budgets, we be waiting for pay-offs
A head shot'll turn a nigga brains into steak sauce
These diamonds offset, reach for ’em and I’ma take off
You ain't got the heart to be shining, we take your chain off (take that off)
Mob shit, after you die, we scratch your name off

[Chorus: Styles P]
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit

[Verse 2: Styles P & Dave East]
If it gangsta, you know that I honor ’em all
Armani tux, looking fresh in Carnegie Hall
Up in Neiman's and Barney's we ball
Got a nice crib, but still keep a couple shooters up in the halls
12 grams, bagged up, had to tuck by the balls
And like we in the prison yard, don't give a fuck how we ball
Better bring that money now, don’t give a fuck who you call
If they don't answer, this hammer get you in touch with the Lord
Little homie got life, he ain't touchin' a board
Get your buttons pushed like the engineer touchin' the board
Everybody got hammers, who's bustin' 'em off?
Got the Kith cloth seats and the truck is a Porsche
That leak got you searchin' for yourself, dusted and lost
Niggas'll never catch up, figured I mustard the Porsche
Cut the powder with Anita, shit'll fuck up your thoughts
He got treated just like a worker 'cause he wasn't a boss

[Chorus: Styles P]
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit

[Outro: Styles P & Dave East]
East side, West side, North side, South side (all sides)
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
'Bout yours, 'bout mine, 'bout money, 'bout time
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
Uptown, downtown, your town, my town
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit
Cop shit, rob shit, live fast, die quick
Yeah, nigga, you know this shit lit

[Outro: Styles P]
AYO!
