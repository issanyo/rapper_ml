[Verse 1]
Draco black and brown, shit be lookin' like Louis kicks, uh
Butters with the tongue, all they talkin' that [?] and sit
Fuck an opp, tell him slide around a hundred ladders
Give him three all in his hat, my nigga Chance the Rapper, uh
Look what you started like fuck it, I'm Chris Paul with the offense
Bang Bros with the oops, if she don't fuck then she walkin', uh
And shawty told me slide, bring that nine piece
Her mama home, I probably fuck her on the side street, woah
Nigga you ain't a boss if you don't call shots
They hate me now, I talk that shit like Lonzo Ball's pop
Dice game pop wherever I go
Came up somethin' crazy, I ain't even touch the dice though
Dippin' through trenches, hoodie on tryna get it
MAC with extensions, no pics, if he reach then he get it, uh
Mafionic Gang, I know you heard about it
Them thirties poppin', get to drop you hear that thirty choppin', uh

[Chorus]
Yeah, my lil nigga savage, he be actin' childish
Yeah, he just killed a nigga and then laughed about it, bah
Gun jammed, call that cock blocking, yeah
Okay grab the glocky, let's go opp shopping (brrrr)
I just got the drop on all my opps now, yeah
I just got the drop on all my opps, ooh
Yeah, I just got the drop on all my opps now
I just, I just woah, I just I just, woah woah

[Verse 2]
Broski out the window with the clip, yeah
I can't pass these niggas no more lick, uh
One was for my paper, yeah that nigga ride
On the block every day, we seen him sit outside
His brother said he needed money, tired of sleepin' hungry
We trappin', eat at Applebee's, he got that three for twenty
His mama said when he get out of school go to the army
He told her soon as he get out of school he got it on him
Bitch I might slice a nigga neck up then go ice my neck up
I could've smashed his sister but she looked just like the nigga
The landlord trippin' on him, said he owed her rent
So the strap under the arm like deodorant
Oh big brody I'm so legit
I know I can die tonight and that's okay
That's why I never tell 'em put the straps away
I might shoot my rival, I might shoot my rival
I put some glass inside my neck like I was suicidal

[Chorus]
Yeah, my lil nigga savage, he be actin' childish
Yeah, he just killed a nigga and then laughed about it, bah
Gun jammed, call that cock blocking, yeah
Okay grab the glocky, let's go opp shopping (brrrr)
I just got the drop on all my opps now, yeah
I just got the drop on all my opps, ooh
Yeah, I just got the drop on all my opps now
I just, I just woah, I just I just, woah woah

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Little niggas, that's who hittin' niggas, not these older niggas
Older niggas, callin' little niggas, just to drill a nigga
Homicide, let the llama fly, kill your mama's side
Molotov, cocktail, they starvin' like it's Ramadan
Farrakhan, couldn't talk to 'em
Tried to drive by and hit 'em 'cause they couldn't walk to 'em
Dave East, Jahlil Beats, lil niggas spark to 'em
Seven grams of kush
Money on my lil homie's head 'cause his man got took
And they into bustin' checks, sewing niggas faithfully
One of 'em got caught, they made 'em kiss the ground, taste the street
One of 'em got locked up, he was cripping from the grippin' street
The other one was bloody, said his custies only way he eat
They all love the gamer spot, you can bet money it was them
Your heard the cannon pop, they hustled out the sandwich shop
One pumped weed, the other pumped pills and crack
The other had the buildin' packed with dust troops, how real is that?

[Chorus]
Yeah, my lil nigga savage, he be actin' childish
Yeah, he just killed a nigga and then laughed about it, bah
Gun jammed, call that cock blocking, yeah
Okay grab the glocky, let's go opp shopping (brrrr)
I just got the drop on all my opps now, yeah
I just got the drop on all my opps, ooh
Yeah, I just got the drop on all my opps now
I just, I just woah, I just I just, woah woah
