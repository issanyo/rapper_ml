[Intro]
Real nigga
Who else?
From the bottom
(It's how we doin' it, let's go)
Hood nigga

[Verse 1: Kur]
Hood nigga, get you what you want if you ask it
Hood nigga, I just had lunch in Manhattan
Got it now, I ain't window shoppin', I'ma grab it
Hood nigga, I ain't with the talkin', I'll blast you
Hood nigga, trap boomin', I ran out of baggies
Right outside the chinks I was posted with my ratchet
Grannie said for it'll get better if you trap it
I put money over bitches, money make me happy
I just popped another ziggas now I'm on my athletes
Ring let me hold the prints, highest shit I crashed it
Bitches hoppin' on my dick, they know I ain't average
'Member when I wanted kicks, savin' up to grab 'em
Moms seen me in them kicks, knew I was trappin'
'Member when I hid my shit right under the mattress
'Member when she found it, she was yellin', she was snappy
Got it how I got it man, I had to make it happen

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Hood nigga
Uh, ain't nobody expect this
See me in the shop, I'm gettin' my Tec fixed
9-5 south in the stretch 6
Chargin' for water weight, just sold 'em a wet brick
I be in the spots everybody can't get in
The king got a chair everybody can't sit in
We livin' the life everybody ain't livin'
This bottle just for us, everybody ain't chipped in
Perc 10 dippin'
We got the same job but we work different shifts to make a life worth livin'
Junkies in the crib had me nervous to get rest
If you ain't movin' right then you know you gettin' left
Only person I fear is me, myself
Codeine fuckin' with my stomach, shit I need my health
Me and Kur on the same old shit
Went back to the 'jects, bustin' checks with the same old bitch
Remember niggas used to laugh, I had the same old kicks
Philipe money, I'm in Harlem eatin' the same old fish
I got a cousin doin' a life sentence
Del Frisco's with white women
Seat back smokin' the life (?)
It's hard to be Derek Jeter in the 9th innin'
Cuban cigars, Vuitton shades, and white linen
I could get used to this, trust me nigga I like winnin'
I could get used to this, trust me nigga I like winnin'

[Pre-Hook]
Way too real for the fakes
Comin' from the bottom, tryna stay rich
Pop another pill, I'm faded
Pop another pill, bitch I'm faded
Way too real for the fakes
Comin' from the bottom, tryna stay rich
Pop another pill, I'm faded
Pop another pill

[Hook]
