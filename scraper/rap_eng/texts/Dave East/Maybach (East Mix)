[Intro]
Cool, I just paint it blue
Ooh, your bitch ate me too
BlocBoy what's crackin'?
I had to do this shit

[Chorus]
Ridin' in a mothafuckin' Maybach
My homie he fresh out, he just did eight flat
Connect fronted some work, I still ain't payed back
Every snitch should die, on God I hate rats
Ridin' in a mothafuckin' Maybach
My homie he fresh out, he just did eight flat
Connect fronted some work, I still ain't payed back
Every snitch should die, on God I hate rats

[Verse]
Cool, I just paint it blue
Ooh, your bitch ate the crew
True, gang I bang it too
Do, what I came to do
Ice, water just splash in the Patek
I caught him in traffic on Madison
I took his top off over some Khalid shit
600 start up automatic
No response, I act like I don't hear that
Told my bitch, bring a friend ya'll can share that
Head shot, aim, right where your beard at
New Glock, shoot you right out your Air Max
AMIRI and Off White, I wear that
Slippers on 'em blocks where you niggas scared at
Everywhere I go, my jewelry I wear that
Same club you front in, you end up dead at
I'm sober [?], where the meds at
I'm not tryna go where the feds at
You jackin' my bro 'til I dead that
Tell Don or Tee Grizz' send a head tap
I bought a Rover with my first check
And I ain't even went to work yet
Catch an opp and leave his shirt wet
How New York sound, yeah I heard Flex
BlocBoy that's my Grape
Now I got the cops talking 'bout my tapes
Scrap you in the box, cause I'm gaining weight
Pull up on the plug, I ain't tryna wait
New Prada's with the straps
Call my niggas Fats, send another batch
She give me head and get a cab
I'll come outside and get a bag
I ain't talkin' bout the dance, when me and Wiz did the dab
I left kids in her mouth, she had your kids and you mad
We got a crib in the South, and bought some whips with the cash
I got a stick in my bag, you play I'm unzippin' it fast

[Chorus]
Ridin' in a mothafuckin' Maybach
My homie he fresh out, he just did eight flat
Connect fronted some work, I still ain't payed back
Every snitch should die, on God I hate rats
Ridin' in a mothafuckin' Maybach
My homie he fresh out he just did eight flat
Connect fronted some work, I still ain't payed back
Every snitch should die, on God I hate rats

[Outro]
BlocBoy, my nigga
I fuck with the Rover, you know what I mean?
It's Maybach season, my nigga
Big boy toys and shit like that, blue lights, you dig?
Feel like first-class in the backseat
Maybach
My homie he fresh out, he just did eight flat
Every snitch should die, on God I hate rats
