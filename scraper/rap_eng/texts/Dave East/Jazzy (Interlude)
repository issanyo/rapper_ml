[Intro]
Hey

[Hook]
Fucking you is all that I've been thinking 'bout
Fucking you is all, all

[Verse]
I can't go through my day
Without you crossing my mind
Them flashbacks be having me
Going insane
I need it now I can't lie
The way you do what you do got me feeling
Some type of way (some type of way)
The way you do what you do got me wanting
You more each day
Each day, cause

[Hook]
Fucking you is all that I've been thinking 'bout
Fucking you is all, all

[Outro]
All, all
The way you do what you do got me feeling
Some type of way
Fucking you is all that I've been thinking 'bout
Fucking you is
The way you do what you do
