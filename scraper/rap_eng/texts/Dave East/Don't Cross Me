[Intro: Dave East & Jazzy]
Don't cross me
Four five is on me
This shit get you up off me
I got niggas who salty

[Verse: Dave East]
Baby don’t cross me, four five is on me
Get you right up off me, I got niggas who salty
Can't care what it cost me, lawyers and court fees
You ain't support me, why you tryna call me?
Ain’t got time for your convo, smokin' on Fronto
Drink it right out the bottle, she give head with her eyes closed
Hammer everywhere I go, no I-D but they follow
No I-D, we on the couch in V-I-P like freak out though
Found it out on my own, like the change now I'm grown
We did this shit in the culture so these niggas would know
I did winters no coat, now I take trips with the bros
Just spit this shit from the soul
Reminisce when I go, reminisce when I go

[Chorus: Dave East]
Told 'em turn the lights out when I'm in the booth
Take my model bitch to lighthouse, project bitch the Ruth's Chris
They can't make me pipe down, snipers on the roof
Maybe it's my lifestyle, maybe it’s my new wrist
I just bought a new whip, white diamonds, it’s no Cool Whip
I bust down an 8ball, I just bought some pool sticks
Pull up with a new bitch, I might be with two chicks
I don't do no one-on-one, I got ’em on some group shit

[Bridge: Dave East]
Baby don't cross me, four five is on me
Get you right up off me, I got niggas who salty
Can't care what it cost me, lawyers and court fees
You ain't support me, why you tryna call me?
Ain’t got time for your convo, smokin' Alfonso
Drink it right out the bottle she give head with her eyes closed
Hammer everywhere I go, no I-D but they follow
No I-D, we on the couch in V-I-P like freak out though

[Chorus: Dave East]
Told 'em turn the lights out when I'm in the booth
Take my model bitch to lighthouse, project bitch to Ruth's Chris
They can't make me pipe down, snipers on the roof
Maybe it's my lifestyle, maybe it's my new wrist
I just bought a new whip, white diamonds, it's no Cool Whip
I bust down an 8ball, I just bought some pool sticks
Pull up with a new bitch, I might be with two chicks
I don't do no one-on-one, I got 'em on some group shit
