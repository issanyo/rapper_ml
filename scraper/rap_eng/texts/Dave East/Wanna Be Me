Joe Joe got 'em again

[Intro]
Just tryna be on my own time
Everybody need a favor lately
I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me

[Verse 1]
Uh, my aunt Barbara died in 2008
My paps became diabetic, he lost a lot of weight
Get mad love in my city, still get a lot of hate
Was never selfish, if I had food, the homies gotta plate
This is my life don't take offense to
We went from riding rentals to more rides than Great Adventure
The ones that's closest give me my distance, I got a temper
Missing my daughter, I'm across the country in a Sprinter
I never ask niggas for nothing now I'm the one they count on
Tryna' smoke some weed, sip some lean, get my bounce on
Me and Bullet smoking out the bag til' an ounce gone
I ain't just screaming free my niggas, I'm looking out for 'em
I just wanted custom seats in the old Capris
Wish I was closer with my nephews, so much to show my niece
I'm tryna' make Wayno go shopping, this nigga know he cheap
Tryna' learn the music industry the way I know the streets

[Chorus]
(I just wanna be me)
I don't care nothing about nothing, you claim (not at all)
I'd rather die before I front on my gang
(I just wanna be me)
In, in my heart I know Allah done bless me
But why my baby mama gotta stress me?
(I just wanna be me)
I'm just tryna' survive in this crazy world
Don't call my phone I'm with my baby girl
(I just wanna be me)
We might have played the staircases with a lot of Henny'
I owe you nothing nigga, not a penny
(I just wanna be me)

[Verse 2]
I just wanna smoke a blunt and watch Goodfellas
I just want that foreign shit to make your hood jealous
I just wanna take Kairi to Dubai
Pop the xanny on the flight to help me sleep through the sky
I just wanna wake up and go the Gucci store
Thinking back when I was broke, I ain't know who to call
Did six months, glad the judge ain't give me that two-to-four
Can't describe the pain I felt when people told me you should ball
On the hood just want a week without an interview
Want my brother to know if he feeling pain, I feel it too
I used to want Angelettie to do an interlude
Now it's so many mad rappers, shit if he did it? Cool
I make way more than my teachers, fuck how I did in school
I just want a girl that like girls so we can pick and choose
Still grippin' tools, the city know 'fore it hit the news
We them different dudes, crib gotta come with a swimming pool

[Chorus]
(I just wanna be me)
I don't care nothing about nothing, you claim
I'd rather die before I front on my gang
(I just wanna be me)
In, in my heart I know Allah done bless me
But why my baby mama gotta stress me?
(I just wanna be me)
I'm just tryna survive in this crazy world
Don't call my phone I'm with my baby girl
(I just wanna be me)
We might have played the staircases with a lot of Henny
I owe you nothing nigga, not a penny
(I just wanna be me)
