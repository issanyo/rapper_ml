[Hook: Casanova]
Niggas trying to catch me in the drop

Now everybody getting shot (boom boom boom)
Niggas trying to catch me in the drop
Niggas trying to book me for my watch

[Verse 1: Young M.A]
B-R double O-K-L-Y-N
B-R double O-K-L-Y-N
B-R double O-K-L-Y-N
It’s Brooklyn back at it again
If it’s an issue, then we handle that
Me and my gun stick together like candle wax
No face no case tie the bandana back
Niggas blam at me fuck it I’m blamming back
Hit the grip with extended clip then a nigga flinch
You showing off let the 40 boom tomato sauce
Those is foreigns nigga take em off
Nigga take em off
I want that watch I want that chain too
Thank that be all
I be mobbing with a bunch of gs yup its red life
High speed dippin on the d’s running red lights
Hop out run in the building fucking up a pair of Nikes
No paradise, I’m in the hood like a pair of dice

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Y’all know what this is nobody move nobody get hurt
Brooklyn forever
Just keep your hands where I can see them
We here now don’t run
We gonna do this nice and smooth
Two times the family ha
They like damn boy you moving different (facts)
Acting Hollywood like you in the movie business (heard you)
Nah dog I just gotta prove em different (shit different)
But still packing like I’m in the moving business (boom boom boom)
Once you level up, you gotta maneuver different
Ya boy still whipping like he in this movie business
Got the Jamba Juice right here in the bomber goose
Niggas tight with me because they baby mama loose
Hold up
You fuck boys ain’t get it
She got with a real one
Now fuck boys can’t hit it
We out here making moves stuck boys ain’t with it
When the fam pop out you fuck boys ain’t litty (huh?)
I had to call cas like bro what up bro
I heard niggas wanna book me for my watch (niggas plotting?)
He said nah it’s a Phillippe for a show
Them niggas wanna book you for a watch
I guess time is money
If being broke is a joke you never find us funny

So ya shorty let me beat her like Ronda Rousey

[Hook: Casanova]

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Cas
You ain’t know I had the sig on me
I could give a fuck about your big homie
Jumpin out that foreign got your bitch on me
In all white looking like I bust a brick open
You Frank Ocean niggas singing to men
The bouncer know how we rocking so we bringing them in
Nuts have that juice around got me leaning again
If I say them niggas is ops you’ll never see me with them
I book niggas niggas book me that’s gangsta I been cut
Homie tried to book me with a razor
Crippin in the Jeep I’m like Tookie with the Wrangler
Tonight I ain’t dancing its hard to boogie with the banger, danger

[Verse 4: Don Q]
Yeah Yeah Don bitch
Cas I got you my nigga
Niggas try to book me for my watch
Me and boogie in the drop got my hoody and the Glock
Couple years back we was cooking cookies in the pot
I had a 30 try 10 I was a rookie in the spot
Fast forward to now I’m the nigga the hoes chose
Bartenders and pole hoes giving me low blows
Now we whipping the Rolls slow maybe the Porsche gold
Cuban is rose gold dollar fonta with four o’s
Studied the game tapes you the king I remain ace
I done ate dinner shaved crack  on the same plate
Sparks still it hit how a car feel
I hit your car wheel but I make it cartwheel til the tarp peel
School of hardknocks I got knocks selling hard crills
Lyrical operated I ain’t taking the narcs deal
Niggas gonna try to throw dirt if they want
But every rhyme that you hear be the verse of the month (what)
Don

[Verse 5: Casanova]
You know where the Nets play
Out in Brooklyn shooting niggas in broad day
Running off on the plug nigga that’s no way
Out in Brooklyn getting brick from the oyay
It’s 2 times, comma that
Brooklyn bring that money back
Tried to catch me slipping in Lust
Left with a hundred pack
Shooters like a quarterback
Money long I ordered that
You should never thought of that
Now you can’t get your daughter back
