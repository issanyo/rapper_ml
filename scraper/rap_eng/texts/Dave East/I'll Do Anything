[Intro]

[Hook]
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
Just to see him walk the streets again
Just to see him hit the weed again
I got a angel, I don't need a friend
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
I got a angel, I don't need a friend
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Malik Carter, my cousin could never bother
I remember smoking, him telling me 'bout his father
I remember talking about bitches that we could party
Freaky did Bicardi, I was lit up a Marley
He was nice in ball, talked shit, had a job and hustled too
Me, him, and lil was stuck, we ain't know what the fuck to do
Y'all was playing Madden, betting everything
Chipotle after hooping, we were smoking even regular green
Two elevens waking up, Delhi and Dauphin Street
Auntie always show me love, if she cooking, we all could eat
You love to rock Polo, never nervous to bag a bitch
Smoking on your black & mild, I would hate it, be mad as shit
I was rocking your shirt the night that lil crashed the rental
Took a trip to North Philly, shit'll really fuck your mental
Them niggas tried to rob you, caught a graze and came to B-More
You slept right on my couch, and to my crib you had a key dog
I miss you nigga, I hear your voice when I be all alone
Still got your number in my jack, I wanna call your phone
You tatted on my hands so when they meeting me, they meeting you
Fell in love with the streets not knowing what the evil do
And to really tell the truth, Freaky I needed you
And I ain't scared to die no more, if I go then I'll be with you
And to really tell the truth, Freaky I needed you
And I ain't scared to die no more, if I go then I'll be with you

[Hook]
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
Just to see him walk the streets again
Just to see him hit the weed again
I got a angel, I don't need a friend
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
I got a angel, I don't need a friend
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again

[Bridge: Floyd Miles]
I’ll do anything to see my nigga home
Shit is gettin crazy fuck is goin on?
Niggas killing niggas, we don’t never run
Live by the gun, die by the gun
Never thought my nigga’d be gone
Heaven dont seem so bad
Fuck them niggas, we gotta be strong
Coming for everything we never had

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I'd do anything to see my cousin, nigga
'Cause when he said he loved a nigga, he really loved a nigga
He ain't dapped me when he seen me, he would hug me nigga
I ain't making up nothing, we was really out hustling nigga
You introduced me to Jonesy, that's like my brother
Miss Michelle, I love her, I treat her just like my mother
Lil going through it, I told him you up above us
Nut come up top just to check me, you gotta love him
Always seen you smile and never mad much
We was happy just being together, we ain't had much
You ain't get the chance to have a kid
You ain't get the chance to cop a Benz
We ain't get a chance to pop the twins
We was going to temples parties, perk 30s in us
I ain't questionin' the Lord, they say His work is never finished
I just don't understand, I know you was just minding your business
They caught my nigga slipping, my life done became so different
I miss him

[Hook]
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
Just to see him walk the streets again
Just to see him hit the weed again
I got a angel, I don't need a friend
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again
I got a angel, I don't need a friend
I'll do anything to talk to 'lik again

[Bridge: Floyd Miles]
I'll do anything to see my nigga home
Shit is gettin crazy fuck is goin on?
Niggas killing niggas, we don't ever run
Live by the gun, die by the gun
Never thought my nigga'd be gone
Heaven don't seem so bad
Fuck you niggas, we gotta be strong
Coming for everyday we never had
