[Verse: 1]
My backwood filled of gorilla glue
I ain't finish school, I don't do
What these niggas do, blow chronic like I'm Snoop



Coke look like we cooking grittz
My lawyer got a good percent
Still thinking bout booking shit
Harlem kid on some Brooklyn shit
They let me in, I'm never leaving
Savage and I'm reckless even
