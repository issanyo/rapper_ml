[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dave East]
The dope boys got their eyes on her
The ball players got their eyes on her, bitches telling lies on her
Her ex send her out of town. she had some pies on her
Now she into body art, they painting designs on her
Connected like I work for Time Warner
Posted on Instagram she hosting a club, that make the line longer
She said she rather smoke with me knowing that mine's stronger
Did a show in Cleveland, found out LeBron want her
I guess the way her body's made got you tryna stay
Blow every dollar in your pocket in the wildest way
I do the same but I love the game at a early age
They turn the page to be on you soon as they learn your name
It come with this shit, I run with the shit
If this was 96, I'd get off a bucket of Cris'
Cuban links, making drinks, and champagne or it's Cognac
Seen her and I own that, asking her where her phone at

[Hook: Rico Love & (Dave East)]
She just wanna wake up every morning to a penthouse view
A bag by Chanel, a Lil Balenciaga shoe
She just want a young street nigga that could fuck her good
But the money only thing that'll get her in the mood
And every nigga wanna give it to her
(I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it)
And every nigga wanna give it to her
(I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it)
Even me, I wanna give it to her
(I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it)
Every nigga wanna give it to her
(I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it, I gotta go get it)

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Floating down fifth like she on the ave
[?] was on her bag, hope none of my homies smashed
If they did, I'd doubt she ever let me know
More concerned with taking trips, feeling sand between her toes
She was dealing with them older men
You know the type tryna be low but you can notice them
I'm gutter like a bowling pin
Love her style, if I had it I'd give it all up
Turn my phone off when I'm with her, don't even call us
She just want a condo with her own closet
Ain't too many been riding, shorty got low milage
Chanel sneakers with the double C's
Membership to the gym but her best friend just had another C
Walk out the spot, the whole block paying attention
Leggings tight fitting, bottom of her shoes red
I'm tryna nail without a tool shed, I don't care what dudes said
Put in so much work she need a new bed
