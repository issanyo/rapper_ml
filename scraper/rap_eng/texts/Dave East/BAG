[Intro]
That they can't go
I'm tryna pull up in a Range Rove
Get my hands on a bankroll
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
All I wanna do is get the money
All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do is get the money
Places that they can't go

[Hook]
We still goin' places that they can't go
I'm just tryna pull up in a Range Rove
I'm still tryna get my hands on a bankroll
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
All I wanna do is get the money
All I wanna do is get the cash
I pull up now they lookin' at me funny
But all I did was go and get that bag

[Verse 1]
Time and time again I had to show and prove
Was tryna get a Benz, ain't wanna go to school
I remember goin' hard and no one knew
So every move I'm makin', this is overdue
Nikes every summer, we was doin' numbers
20's for the dutches then we blew the hundreds
I couldn't see myself out here just doin' nothin'
If you ain't talkin' money start a new discussion

[Hook]
We still goin' places that they can't go
I'm just tryna pull up in a Range Rove
I'm still tryna get my hands on a bankroll
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
All I wanna do is get the money
All I wanna do is get the cash
I pull up now they lookin' at me funny
But all I did was go and get that bag

[Verse 2]
Diamonds was all we wanted, the mornin's was hard as hell
Cartier for the framework, really ain't hard to tell
We changed shirts
Came up from the same dirt
Then life happened
I liked rappin', you wanted to earn your name first
The Mauries had us thinkin' we made it but we was still broke
I'm different, if everybody stopped then I'ma still go
Envisioned my brother on TV blocking field goals
My love never died for all of the blocks that I still go
I love you

[Hook]
We still goin' places that they can't go
I'm just tryna pull up in a Range Rove
I'm still tryna get my hands on a bankroll
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
All I wanna do is get the money
All I wanna do is get the cash
I pull up now they lookin' at me funny
But all I did was go and get that bag
We still goin' places that they can't go
I'm just tryna pull up in a Range Rove
I'm still tryna get my hands on a bankroll
That's the way it go, that's the way it go
All I wanna do is get the money
All I wanna do is get the cash
I pull up now they lookin' at me funny
But all I did was go and get that bag
