[Hook]
The streets ain't the same no more
It feel like everybody tellin'
This is a stick up, just lay on the floor
Bodies drop, we hitting everybody's yellow
Head shot, give 'em head shot, aim at everybody melon
Never seen a trap but everybody sell it
Never been to jail before but everybody felons

[Verse 1]
Misdemeanor, I picked the Beamer, that's just how I like to ride
Connect called me, he landed, I need to see him
He got me waiting, nigga told me meet him after five
No pizzeria, my niggas passing pies
Watch out for the D's, I know they passing by
Watch out for the D's, they wanna lock us up
Half my niggas in prison, they still ain't satisfied

[Hook]
The streets ain't the same no more
It feel like everybody tellin'
This is a stick up, just lay on the floor
Bodies drop, we hitting everybody's yellow
Head shot, give 'em head shot, aim at everybody melon
Never seen a trap but everybody sell it
Never been to jail before but everybody felons

[Verse 2]
Grand larceny awkwardly niggas target me
Jealous cause I shop on 5th Ave, they where the Target be
Raised out of poverty, not a youngin as hard as me
Bucking knees [?] nigga don't bother me
Talk about the pain, talk about the [?]
No umbrella walking in the rain, niggas took my chain
Never got it back but now I got it made
And I ain't into jewelry, your bitch know you ain't cool as me

[Hook]
The streets ain't the same no more
It feel like everybody tellin'
This is a stick up, just lay on the floor
Bodies drop, we hitting everybody's yellow
Head shot, give 'em head shot, aim at everybody melon
Never seen a trap but everybody sell it
Never been to jail before but everybody felons

[Verse 3]
Everything changed, everybody different
Everybody popping pills, molly got us tripping
Thinking back, I had a crush on Halle Berry
Most these niggas is bitches, undercover like Tyler Perry
That coke had lil fiends on line, you gotta hurry
My whole block indited my nigga I gotta worry
That brown [?] town lose
By round two, they found you
We done drowned you, you can't swim in the water with sharks
[?] like Owen Heart
I want everything in double like this Noah's Arch
It ain't the same

[Hook]
The streets ain't the same no more
It feel like everybody tellin'
This is a stick up, just lay on the floor
Bodies drop, we hitting everybody's yellow
Head shot, give 'em head shot, aim at everybody melon
Never seen a trap but everybody sell it
Never been to jail before but everybody felons
