[Verse 1]
Who would've thought I'd be the one to make it?
Anything I wanted I had to prepare to take it
My schedule gettin hectic
Narcoleptic I never sleep
In and out of town
It was clickin we said we'd never leave
I got a passion for hustlin just like my father got
I can't go get a shape up, most talked about in barber shops
I always stayed away from those that would involve the cops
I tried to spread love, but nowadays they talk a lot
[?] chill in the battlefield, I'm purple-hearted
Black-hearted, this for when lil' had the black charger
Popped every [?], you never there like a bad father
I guess money make us look different like a bad barber
Hamdulillah, coulda died in that car
I've been surviving for years, I cannot hide all these scars
Harlem that's all in my blood, shaking the coast like what you think 'a that
[?] old shit, on the 10th street I sold nicks
For a fifth, I copped the all white ups with the gold tips
Couldn't do the seafood, cause Bully don't eat no fish
My P.O knew I was smokin, she never turned in no piss
Used to tell me stories how her and her husband don't kiss
This real life, come in my building see what it feel like
The oven open, we was all sweating, that shit ain't feel right
Now I want the Cuban, the Rollie, my whole grill iced
We all got, one life to live
You can't get killed twice

[Hook x2]
I've been smokin dope
I just wanna know
If I ever leave, will they love me like before?
If you never seen they face, don't open that door
We tryna get low, we tryna get dough

[Outro]
We tryna get...
