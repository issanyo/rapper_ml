[Hook: Nino Man]
Look at me
Look at you
You a lame
I'm the truth
I impress
You a goof
I'm the best
Here's the proof

[Verse 1: Nino Man]
I really go hard for this shit
These niggas be crying
They get the same 24 hours
Niggas ain't grinding
These niggas ain't winning
These niggas be lying
These niggas is bums
They not even trying
I'm too busy flying
Visiting islands
Watch full of diamonds
Damn right I'm shining
That money be coming in
You should see what I'm jumping in
All this money I'm bumping in
Yeah, they hate when I rub it in (hah)
All my life I was bubbling
Got addicted to hustling
I remember the struggling
[?] putting numbers in
So it ain't no comparing me
'Less I'm playing mirror-me
Plus I got your [?] with me
These hoes wanna marry me

[Hook: Nino Man]
Look at me
Look at you
You a lame
I'm the truth
I impress
You a goof
I'm the best
Here's the proof

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Look at you, look at me
It ain't no comparing, my nigga
That Dolce Gabbana, I'm wearing it
All of these diamonds just got your bitch staring at niggas
And I got a hundred to bury them niggas
You act like you scared of them niggas
I'm up in your crib like I married your sister
I fuck and get back on a lear with my hitta (we out)
I trap the gram every minute
I tried the college thing, hit campuses with it (facts)
Grab her ass and watch her man get offended
I keep a pistol, I ain't ran in a minute
I'm on an island somewhere tanning with women
Nino called me he got Janet on Lenox
I'm tryna bring Halle Berry to 1st
So maybe Viva could've raised the temperature
I got a diploma in drug sales
I know niggas that honestly love jail
I'm from the dirt, know how mud smell
Only thing that you ever did was fail
Look alive, niggas act dead
Sold 3.5's in my Vasque's; GORE-TEX
When I sort checks
Put it in they face like a black cast
