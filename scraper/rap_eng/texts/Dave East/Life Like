[Verse 1]
They tried to rob me for a bank roll
I was gettin it late night, killin' for them pesos
Baby have a safe flight, mama told me stay close
Tryin' to get that Range Rov', that's why we let cocaine go
Uncle had a cadillac, used to rock a Kangol
Told me keep my eyes open when you know that thing close
I'm just tryin' to kill niggas, I don't want the game close
Hard to trust these new niggas, gotta keep my gang close
I just want some sunshine 'cause we've been in the rain yo
Smilin' in the cop's face, I told him I would stay low
We was on that heart to heart blue love
Know they show my crew love
I just found a new plug, he helped a nigga name grow...

[Chorus]
They ask me what my life like
I just found a new plug, homie got the right price
I just wanna get away, lookin' for the right flight
30 with a beam on it, nigga that's a bright light
They ask me what my life like
I just found a new plug, homie got the right price
I just wanna get away, lookin' for the right flight
30 with a beam on it, nigga that's a bright light

[Verse 2]
They tried to tell me I would not shine
I ain't tryin' to box niggas, ridin' with a Glock nine
Eyes bloodshot red, lookin' like a stop sign
End a nigga lifeline, he ever try and stop mine
It was me and Lil', Freaky call me "let's get high, nigga"
Now he got me talkin' to the sky, nigga, damn I miss my nigga
I had 250, he had 250, 5 nigga
No More Drama, Mary J. Blige nigga
Let's buy liquor
Wakin up to two 11's, I just wanted the new gun
Now I'm gettin' endorsed, Wayno call me when them shoes come
Cusso said he got some head and left her with a blue tongue
I've been up for a few suns, wanna father a few sons
To teach 'em all this G from all these streets
I smoke sour couldn't call me sweet, you better call me B
Rico voice, I'm focused, don't need no choice
Come flip a key of boy, but these C-notes'll leave 'em moist

[Chorus]
They ask me what my life like
I just found a new plug, homie got the right price
I just wanna get away, lookin' for the right flight
30 with a beam on it, nigga that's a bright light
They ask me what my life like
I just found a new plug, homie got the right price
I just wanna get away, lookin' for the right flight
30 with a beam on it, nigga that's a bright light
