[Intro: Kur]
(Yeah, yeah)
Let's go
(Oh)
I'm ready
(Oh yeah)
I got it, I got it, I mean it
(Oh yeah, yeah oh)

[Verse 1: Kur]
I was all for niggas, they was all for they self
Almost lost myself
Almost fell in love with her but I caught myself
Gotta put my all in it, I can't short myself
Self discipline, I really had to force myself
I coulda been another nigga but I caught myself
I know what it feel like, I was poor myself
So every time I'm in the valley I enjoy myself
All these pills that I'm takin' bad for my health
And I work my ass off and it ain't for my heath
It be for them checks
Just a couple years back I was so in debt
Shoulda seen where I came from, I know I'm blessed
My dad hear it on my voice, he can tell I'm stressed
I deserve it 'cause I've really been through hell and back
Niggas turned they back, I thought they had my back
I just signed my deal, run and tell them that, let's go (haha..)

[Chorus: Kur]
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
I ain't switch up, I ain't change up
I ain't switch up, I ain't change up

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Had 10 dollars to my name, you don't know that feelin'
Like bein' lost in the 'jects and you don't know the buildings
Sex, money, and drugs, I know that's so appealin'
Through all the struggle in my life, it's good to know I'm chillin'
Before metro cars we used tokens
Gettin' high on the low, pops ain't know I was smokin'
Grew up in the section, you either Blood or you Locin'
108th and 1st, my homies is still posted
Druggie on curfew, they always told me patience was a virtue
I'm really from the streets, no commercial
I ain't got a gimmick, motherfuck a critic
They don't know them times that I was sleepin' in that Civic
They don't know about 5 in the mornin', they was raidin'
I shoulda stayed in school but I just wanted the latest
Ain't take long to realize them books couldn't pay rent
My closest friends kept pistols on 'em everywhere they went
Used to hit the lights and watch the roaches scatter
And I don't wanna fuck her if the homie had her
I don't wanna touch her if she been around
My Eritrean told me hit her when I get in town
I asked my mother "where you wanna go? Just pick a city"
Promoters mad, I brought like 100 niggas with me
I stack 100's, I'm in Saks Fifth spendin' 50's
Streets turned me into a monster, you know the kicks is Fendi

[Chorus: Dave East]
I really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
I ain't switch up, I ain't change up

[Chorus: Kur]
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
Really came up, really came up
I ain't switch up, I ain't change up
I ain't switch up, I ain't change up

[Outro: Kur]
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
