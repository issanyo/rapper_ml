[Intro]
Shit gettin' realer and realer, ugh
Still me though
(DJ SpinKing, baby!)
Gangsta

[Verse 1]
The first time I seen cocaine
I put it on my gums, had my whole mouth numb
Smokin' everyday for the pain
From a leak I'ma blow till the whole ounce's done
My income had a different outcome
Pistol in the sofa was my lil' couch gun
The whole city trynna figure out some
Me and Bully with the fully on the down south run
Me and Wayno linked up, it was game over
Leavin' out of Butch's crib with a 'cane odor
Bitch invite me to her crib, bring the gang over
Me and V HK's in the Range Rover
Niggas spin the block wrong, we gon' bang on him
If it's on, thunderstorm, we gon' rain on 'em
I ain't got a "OOOUUU" or "Panda"
But I be makin' moves with this hammer
Locked up, I was cool in the slammer
That foreign on me, shit, put two in your Phantom
[?] hit my line what the lick read
I was sellin' niggas dimes on a 10 speed
If that car look funny it gets Swiss cheese
Give her what she want, fuck what a bitch need
I'm pourin' Codeine in a Simply
These sweat's is Balenci'
I'm next, that's offensive

[Hook]
Break it all down on the table
Any time I had 'caine I was able
Lil' told me, "never let the money change you"
I'm on TV, I ain't had no cable (at all)
Break it all down on the table
Any time I had 'caine I was able
Lil' told me, "never let the money change you"
I'm on TV, I ain't had no cable (no)
Break it all down on the table
Any time I had 'caine I was able
Lil' told me, "never let the money change you"
I'm on TV, I ain't had no cable (no)
Break it all down on the table
Break it all down on the table
Lil' told me, "never let the money change you"
I'm on TV, I ain't had no cable (none)

[Verse 2]
10 homies on the block and we all rude
My cousin got rich off of dog food
Goin' against us, know that ain't a smart move
Border life, in that water you'll be shark food
You know it's hard to swim when that wave come
Robbed a nigga, shot a nigga with the same gun
Usually your biggest hater be a day one
Smiles got me mixin' Louis up with [?]
D'uss√© shots, shout-out to Lenny
I remember I ain't have a penny
Fully loaded semi
J.O.S.E., jealous one still envy
Everyday the 4 train, now a Bentley
I'm just like you, blunt lit when I slide through
I've been that nigga since high school
Outside trappin' all night too
Porsche Panamera is light blue
Even hit the coke and rice, boo
You can't even be around me, I don't like you
Candy Benz don't it remind you of Hi-Chew
Women blessin' me and I ain't get to say a-choo
This Glock hold 16, that's 8 by 2
Never worry 'bout a nigga, I just make my moves
Jumped out, pump out, this the way I shoot
Popped as many Percs as me, you'd blank out too
Even though that thing go 'round, we could shake out too

[Hook]
Break it all down on the table
Any time I had 'caine I was able
Lil' told me, "never let the money change you"
I'm on TV, I ain't had no cable (at all)
Break it all down on the table
Any time I had 'caine I was able
Lil' told me, "never let the money change you"
I'm on TV, I ain't had no cable (at all)
Break it all down on the table
Any time I had 'caine I was able
Lil' told me, "never let the money change you"
I'm on TV, I ain't had no cable (no)
Break it all down on the table
Break it all down on the table
Lil' told me, "never let the money change you"
I'm on TV, I ain't had no cable (none)
