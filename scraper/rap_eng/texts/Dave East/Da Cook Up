[Intro: Sheek Louch]
[?] bring that ass
Vinny Idol, what up?
Donnie
Yeah
(Vinny Idol, nigga)

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
It's an understatement if you say I'm on my grind
They say I'm underrated, see them comments all the time
I was on the block holdin' guns, doin' crime
Baggin' up crack before Mary heard me rhyme
These dirty little bitches tryin' to turn into a dime
I ain't fuck you back then, won't fuck you in my prime
Dark lookin' half-ounce in Patron with some lime
Couple bottle orders to my table and I'm fine
Still be ridin' dirty, rather have it than be slippin'
Got a lot to lose so all my niggas think I'm trippin'
We ain't gotta argue, I already got the clip in
I turn a nigga purple like that nasty shit he sippin'
All that bread you got, why you put it on the 'Gram?
You ain't pay your child support, how the fuck is you the man?
We was in the kitchen had that Coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, then we came up with a plan
Lox

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I just came up off a gram, get the Benz truck, wagon series
Ten thousand dollars on Denim, I left with Madam Mary
Niggas can't believe that I made it, I know they mad to hear me
I grew up on The Lox, you can hear it, them niggas had to feel me
When Sheek spit that 24 Hours To Live verse, plug got robbed and gave us twenty-four hours to live first
I done got rich off this rap, could have honestly did worse
I ain't cocky, they just copied all the shit I did first
How you claimin' that you hard when you ain't never been to D-Block?
Got your bitch in my lap and it sound like she tryna' beat-box
Caught him lackin' in his own hood, chased him for three blocks
Tangerine seats in the 'Prese drop, thug life make you think [?]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
On the last run right before the game was over
We used to whip the work with a fifty cent cobra
I was in the stew but the crew was sleepin' over
We made a couple hunnid, fuck around and bought a Rover
Then we got the deals like a nigga found a clover
Clue freestyles where we got our most exposure
We was only doin' what the older niggas showed us
After the advance we was still sellin' boulders
Industry hate it 'cause they could never control us
Bad bitch under the dryer, she in the rollers
Big shout out to all the soldiers
Fuck it, we got rich, that's what the overall goal was

[Outro: Sheek Louch]
We was in the kitchen had that Coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, then we came up with a plan
We was in the kitchen had that Coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, chop, chop, chopped it up
We, we was in the kitchen had that coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, then we came up with a plan
We, we was in the kitchen had that coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, then we (chop, chop, chopped it up)
Lox
