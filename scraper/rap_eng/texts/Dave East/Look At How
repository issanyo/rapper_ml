[Chorus: Mckinley Ave]
Look at how, Nigga stay drip
Look at how, I whip that whip
Look at how, I make that flip
Look at how, I keep that grip
Look at how, Nigga stay fresh
Look at how, get that bread
Look at how, get that head
Look at how, duck them feds

Look at how, Bitch look at how, Look at how, Nigga look at how
Look at how, Look at how, Look at how, Nigga Look at how
Look at how, Nigga Look at how, Look at how, Bitch Look at how

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Look at how that A.P. fill a nigga wrist (Wrist)
I show no remorse if i hit a nigga chick (None)
Look at how a nigga from the town gettin' rich (Rich)
And look at how i got this 4 pound in the vip (four five)
Look at me and sex fifth gettin' more drip (Drip)
Belaire i sip' i don’t do no more Cris' (Nope)
Promoter told me i brought to many crips
Get locked up forever brought too many sticks (Whoa)
Look how quick hatin' niggas jump on dick
I jumped out the whip with pointers on my wrist (Pointers)
I won't run from shit
We pumped out the bricks
Too drunk in the club we might stomp out you bitch (My Bad)
You get your energy offa' that Hennessy
Claim you a enemy you'll be a memory
I came through island i bet they remember me
Ride with two 40's inside of my whip wit' me
Look at my wrist I'ma whip till my arm hurt
Rake up paper i don't do no yard work (None)
I don't fear a nigga live on God's Earth
To slip 20 thousand in my mom purse (Mama)
Rob a nigga put your arms up (Put 'em up)
In the trap since you was wearin' Von Dutch
Froze the piece and got my charm stuck (Froze)
Tax the same niggas used to charge us
I don't talk much


[Chorus: Mckinley Ave]
Look at how, Nigga stay drip
Look at how, I whip that whip
Look at how, I make that flip
Look at how, I keep that grip
Look at how, Nigga stay fresh
Look at how, get that bread
Look at how, get that head
Look at how, duck them feds

Look at how, Look at how, Look at how, Nigga Look at how
Look at how, Bitch look at how, Look at how, Nigga look at how
Look at how, Look at how, Look at how, Nigga Look at how
Look at how, Nigga Look at how, Look at how, Bitch Look at how
