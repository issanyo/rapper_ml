[Verse 1: Dave East]
I done stumbled on a hundred racks
Used to treat the trap like a running back
Nothing but hundred thousand I was done with packs
Hundred million nigga I be done with rap
You snitch loving, bitches love a rat
Hard to kick the habit 'cause she love the crack
East and Corey nigga they gon run this back
If you fuck my bitch, I don't want her back
I'm a vagabon got narcotic salt
Bring it to your door like it's Domino's
Hundred dollar gets your baby momma blown
Word to freaky glad my nigga Dolla home
I know you drink, but bitch, I gotta smoke
I know you see me with a lot of locs
Know you see me get a lot of dough
I can't fit it in my wallet, ho
Sak pas√© I've seen a lotta yay
I ain't giving beats I ain't Dr. Dre
You ain't got to listen to me nigga
Guarantee you hearin' what this choppa say
Shower Posse with the shotty gang
Finessen on 'em Louis dressin' on 'em
N'ap boule, I make a model pay
I know they want a picture
But they gotta wait, I'm a vagabond

[Chorus: Corey Finesse]
Vagabond, vagabond lajan la I got a lotta dough
Adios, Adios shmoney calling me like vamanos
Wish I could stay but bitch it's time to go
I done stumbled on a pot of gold
Dress my bitch up in designer clothes
Flexin' on 'em got a lot of dough
Vagabond, vagabond lajan la I got a lotta dough
Adios, Adios shmoney calling me like vamanos
Wish I could stay but bitch it's time to go

[Verse 2: Corey Finesse]
Finessin school i made the honor roll

Can't even lie I got a lot of those
Then I pick 'em like eney miny, moe
On me 'cause I got a lot of dough
And they know what this hittin' fo

The day before didn't see you come
Yeah nigga try to take it from me
Vagabond you know my niggas comin
And I dont really think you niggas want it
No sugar coat, I keep this shit a hunned
They hit me funny thing is that I love it
Ima always keep that money runnin

Cause I gotta lotta dough

And it make that girl come up out her clothes
Sheisty cocaine, no I don't front
They took my dawg then they gotta go
Still screaming free all my vagabonds

[Chorus: Corey Finesse]
Vagabond, vagabond lajan la I got a lotta dough
Adios, Adios shmoney calling me like vamanos
Wish I could stay but bitch it's time to go

Dress my bitch up in designer clothes
Flexin' on 'em got a lot of dough
Vagabond, vagabond lajan la I got a lotta dough
Adios, Adios shmoney calling me like vamanos
Wish I could stay but bitch it's time to go
I done stumbled on a pot of gold
Dress my bitch up in designer clothes
Flexin' on 'em got a lot of dough
