Gangster
Gangster

[Verse 1]
5 bands fresh up out the cage, no cut walkin' out the court
Fuck the judge, we got shit you could snort
I heard you take back everything that you bought
If you was my cellmate, shit we would've fought
Yeah I got felonies, yeah I was sellin' tree
Black told me whip that shit up with a fork
This money comin', what the fuck is you tellin' me?
Now I'm just shoppin' out Beverly Hills
I got pills, tell me what is you sellin' me?
I know you make up with jealousy
I'm just chillin' where felons be, I'm lightin' cookies and celery
Only wit niggas I know going to hell with me
Burn in that fire for all we done done
Only keep medical all in my blunt
I got some pills and y'all could get one
I got some hoes, if I call they gon' come
We up in the mansion, we all from the slums
I had a dream I was talkin' to Pun
I told him I just had a talk with his son
I told him his father was part of the sum
My man just called me, he got caught with a gun
Pray to God, ain't no bodies on it
Tried to sell it, ain't nobody want it
See a corner, ain't nobody on it
I can make it mine by the mornin'
Tres, nickels, dimes, and them quarters
Gotta check the line for informants
You ain't even signed, you recordin'
Talkin' to the swine since they caught him
When they said that time you was talkin'
Better off residin' in a coffin

[Chorus]
I just cannot see me callin' you bitches no more I got money to make (I cannot see it)
I was just trappin' before I was rappin', my lawyer was workin' my case (Facts)
I can not trust all them watches you coppin', that chain you got on that look fake (Bang bang)
I had a talk with your wife in the club and she told me she just want a taste (Ahh!)
I just cannot see me callin' you bitches no more I got money to make (I can't see it)
I was just trappin' before I was rappin', my lawyer was workin' my case (Trappin')
I can not trust all them watches you coppin', that chains you got on that look fake (Can't trust it)
I had a talk with your wife in the club and she told me she just want a taste (Ahh!)

[Verse 2]
Listen, I been drinkin' Rose so long, so this year I'll do nothin' but Ace (Ace)
When BIG died, Harlem World dropped, I swear I listen to nothin' but Ma$e (Murder)
They talk behind my back all the time but never say nothin' up to my face (Never)
I jump out the Wraith with the homie
These diamonds they jump out the face of the Rollie
She textin' my phone like she naked and horny
And I ain't got time, got a plane in the mornin'
I'm high off some shit, I don't know what they call it
They gave me a number but I'm never callin' it
And we make a movie anywhere that we walkin'
I'm really livin' this shit, you just talkin' it
Better pay attention who you been talkin' with
I told LV I won't stop til we all get rich
Hoppin' in something, I'm good with my marketin'
You ain't got it, you ain't got it, no bargainin'
Block the number, guarantee she gon' call again
Heads always turn around when we walkin' in
Money comin', I could ball like a tournament
I ain't got it, if you need it, I'll order it
This designer shit, I wasn't affordin' it
Public housin', where them cameras recordin' shit
I don't give a fuck as long as my daughter rich
Catch you in the store, have the whole corner lit
Early morning in the lobby, we loiterin'
I think AI was a Hoya then
That's back when I couldn't afford the rent
Life is a bitch, so enjoy it then
Look at my neck you wonder where that water went
Money to get and I swear I want all of it

[Chorus]
I just cannot see me callin' you bitches no more I got money to make (I can't see it)
I was just trappin' before I was rappin', my lawyer was workin' my case (facts)
I can not trust all them watches you coppin', that chain you got on that look fake (bang, bang)
I had a talk with your wife in the club and she told me she just want a taste
I just cannot see me callin' you bitches no more I got money to make
I was just trappin' before I was rappin', my lawyer was workin' my case (facts)
I can not trust all them watches you coppin', that chain you got on that look fake
I had a talk with your wife in the club and she told me she just want a taste
