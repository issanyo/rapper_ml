You're talking 'bout love but I don't see it
I'm more familiar with heat then leave you under the cement
Cement, call it threes I'm retro like Esco
Looking for the bitch with the best throat, fresh clothes
Walked out the cleaners, connect out in phoenix
And I was born with it they're telling me I'm a genius
As long as my misses legs is thick as sirenas from the belly of the beast
The world ain't never seen us
They talking bout love as if I need it it's hard to feel emotion
I'm constantly drunk and weed it
My main man for ten years switch before I seen it
My first love wasted my time I don't believe it
It's seeming like hate is the new love I'm faded and few clubs
The haters confuse love
Love is what make Tiger Woods go on the green
Love is what got Kobe Bryant stuck in the gym
Love is what Denzel kill em in every movie
No prejudices bring the groupies my spirit glow from within
Love for the highest why Delora's lost her job and her daughter's staring to cry ain't no food for her inside
She smoking on credit and doing whatever for a rock
It ain't never gon' stop cause the love is that deep or
Could it be the lust when the trust is a factor
Love tin the fade, there's too much for the laughter
Puffing the master cause the dutch keep me casper
Floating like balloon strings, caught up in the rapture
I need it with the lights slow, incense burning every lesson on the block considered intense learning
Before I was even ten-cent earning
Automatically got it never a stick shift person
Love was in the air first time that I slow down
Just was trying to fuck, no time for the romance
Couple bitches daddy told em with the program
Loving for the hustle made me wait for the post man
Early in the morning you was still sleep
Love have me up all night, tryin' to kill beats
But I never had it, how they had it so I still creep
I don't make excuses, I'm making niggas feel me
Giving them the real me (giving them to me)
Never just pass it by and you never stopped in the hood
You was just passing by
I never thought I'd see my little homie just ask to die in the game
And you talking 'bout practice, L and I
With a pilot by your side you couldn't be half as fly
Ring die tryin' to walk be alive if he had a ride
I paint the picture so effortless
We're talking bout love hold on and perfecting it
Boss is take losses no matter the deficit
I'm staying duck nigga I never sit

4x
Love and get you killed in the streets
But I got that same love for my unborn child
Love don't pay the bills, can't be waiting for no deal
Hit the road and kill one more time
