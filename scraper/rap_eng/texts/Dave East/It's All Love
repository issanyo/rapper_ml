To all my homies up north and everybody we lost
Just giving me motivation, thank you for the support
It’s all love (it’s all love)
It’s all love (it’s all love)
To all my sisters, you ain’t gotta sell your soul at the bar
Girl you know you a star, oh yeah you know who you are
It’s all love (it’s all love)
It’s all love

[Verse 1: Don Q]
I seen a nigga get indicted for some petty shit
Don moving but they charge him like he selling bricks
I pray that evidence they got on you don’t ever stick
But god forbid you lose your trail, I pray you never snitch
I came a long way, man I never seen it coming
Ten diamond chains, trust me, you gon’ see me coming
Something clean outside, yeah you see me stunting
I just came to grab a bitch, I told my driver leave it running
Man I swear before I knew about a re-up I was hittin’ [?]
Fuck with a couple hoes, hit Crowns just to eat up
Every ball written, turn my idols to my competition
Don be pimpin’, I got head in every car driven
Couple years back, I was Abercrombie Fitchin’
Now the letters on my sweater got Givenchy stiches
Thought the engine hit the corner, see that Ferrari spinning
Start to finish, I promise I’ma be the hardest in it
Don

[Interlude: Don Q]
Yeah, it’s all love, yeah
Yeah, it’s all love, yeah yeah
It’s all love, yeah
It’s all love, yeah yeah
Hah, it’s all love, yeah

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Always just tryna get my dollars up
Had the Pele, hoody was Hollister
Every rental we got they followed us
You don’t know how it feel when your ribs touch
Stomach growl make you say fuck shootin’ out the car, I’ma run ‘em down
Now these same bars got me over a hundred thou
Was running wild, I couldn’t wait ‘til the sun was down
I ain’t dead or in jail, I know my mother proud
Haters screw up they face, inside they wanna smile
Free Yops, free Draino, free Scrap, Free Trav
Free my nigga Black, free Lil Crack
Free Littles, free my cousin E
Shawty ‘bout to come home
Free Buddha, free my hitter Mula
Now his son grown
Me and pops not gettin’ the greatest tomorrow
But I knew it used to stress him out just to think that I’m starving
I’ma eat pops, I’m concrete
These niggas sheetrock
Feel my pain after the beat stop
It’s all love nigga
Hundreds keep coming, these niggas stop nothing
Youngin keep gunning, these niggas drop fronting
I got some weed, he like to smoke, wish I could get it to him
He just want me to send some pictures to him
Answer his calls so I can listen to him
He keeps telling me about the niggas that did it to him

It’s all love (it’s all love)
It’s all love
