[Hook]
Police just hopped out
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
Homie got robbed on the block
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
Swiped for like fifteen bottles
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
This bitch keep asking me questions
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
Body after body on the block
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
I'm on dope bitch, I'm out of my mind
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'
I don’t know nothin' bout nothin'

[Verse 1]
By the bus with the work in the suitcase
Now every night I'm in the booth late
Rollie on, tattoos with the screw face
Everything real, I don't do fake
Fendi be black but the eyes on the yellow
I pray I never collide with the devil
I kill everything, I should ride with a shovel
Come get your wife cause her eyes on my bezel
Come get your wife all my niggas is savage
I used to dream I could sleep in the palace
I used to dream I could fuck with an actress
I used to dream my dreams is reality, Lord
Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head
Block instincts help me shake y'all feds
On 116th finna drop off meds
All I really wanna do is count more bread
Yeezy's same color as a moon rock
Mix the caviar with the moon rock
Pistol and the pills in my tube sock
My cousin with the late few, he had to do shock
On the corner where they say it ain't safe at
If you owe a nigga money, better pay that
Got a scale in the car I could weight that
Niggas tell on their squad, why you say that?

[Verse 2]
5:30 you can have her when I'm done with her
I don't know nothin' about cuffin'
I paid every time I was in debt
I don't know nothin' about bluffin'
Head down to the bag and a ziplock
Y'all don't know pumpin'
If I see it and I like it I'ma buy that
I don't know nothin' about frontin'
Pull her hair while I hit it by the back
I don't know nothin' about lovin'
I'ma ride, I'ma die for my cousin
He was down with me when most of y'all wasn't
Out of town still fuckin' up the budget
We sippin' brown outside like fuck it
It ain't never been hard for me to let go
That boy filled up with petro
Y'all still smokin' that bullshit
That shit'll give a nigga strep throat
Nowadays you might catch me with Esco
I don't really care who got the best flow
We ain't ever following no dress code
Straight to my account where the check go
Now I'm gettin' love on the west coast
Drawin' up the plays, I'm the head coach, raw
