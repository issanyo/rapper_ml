[Intro]
My nigga Ray Mack finally showed up with that shit man
We right, Harlem
Gang

[Verse 1]
I got Gucci all on me in traffic
Smellin' like Dolce and Gabbana with the ratchet
We be doin' drugs, all my young niggas savage
Told 'em calm down, they hot headed, it don't matter
Cops got a nigga at the light for the smoke
Call Raphael throw some ice in the rope
Look at these stones like ice in Coke
Money got me goin' harder than when I was broke
Workin' in the winter, in the summer, we can vacate
Nigga you ain't never seen an AK
Show your bitch to the world like I'm Ray J
Never gave a fuck about what they say
1250 for the shirt, 900 for the sneaks
I was in the cut gettin' blunted with a freak
I remember months I was strugglin' to eat
Now I send a flight, put my mother on the beach
Cocaine, all white prestos
Thinkin' bout if Biggie was on Death Row
Bring 'em to the rooftop and let go
Bust that ass on the floor if the bed broke
Wild nigga pay attention and you might learn
Had Snoopy on my sweater, that was Iceburg
Talk yourself to some money with the right words
Ass fat, cute face, but I might curve

[Hook]
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
If they ain't got Fanta get a Sun Kiss
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
If they ain't got Fanta get a Sun Kiss
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss

[Verse 2]
In SoHo, perform in the front seat
Took a loss, made it back, took me one week
I be feelin' like the army when I'm one deep
Now the little homies all bump me
Used to want one whip, now I want three
Used to want one crib, now I want three
Floyd Mayweather told me he a fan nigga
So why the fuck would I care about who don't see?
I come from a city where they don't sleep
My homies got some cases that they won't beat
Even though the lawyers on standby
The judge settin' bars that we won't reach
All this gold on my neck like a trophy
Have some respect if you ever approach me
Just cause I'm rapping they think that they know me
I never changed, can't go back to the old me
I get the cake and break down with the homies
I'm on the plane sipping Remy and Moet
I be with locs and the blood niggas know me
Got snakes on my Gucci, my bitch tour like Chloe
Legend like Kobe
Shouts to my Haitians, get Dollaz like Zooey
Radio stations, they got me, they know me
I'm on vacation just shoppin' for Rollies
My niggas is felons, I ride with the parol-eys

[Hook]
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
If they ain't got Fanta get a Sun Kiss
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
If they ain't got Fanta get a Sun Kiss
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss

[Outro]
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Bitch I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
If they ain't got Fanta get a Sun Kiss
Dope house, no lights, but my gun work
10 toes on the ground with a blunt lit
I'm rollin' and I only popped one Perc
Watchin' two bad bitches tongue kiss
