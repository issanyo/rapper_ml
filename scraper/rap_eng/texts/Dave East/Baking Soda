[Intro]
Yeah, I ain't been to sleep in so long
We up

[Hook]
The stove on, flame rising, baking soda ready
I got the work, watch it cook, time to go already
The way I'm moving through these streets, they think I'm on already
I know we might look light, but trust, we more than heavy

The stove on, flame rising, baking soda ready
I got the work, watch it cook, time to go already
The way I'm moving through these streets, they think I'm on already
I know we might look light, but trust, we more than heavy

[Verse 1]
Diddy bopping down Lexington, foreign women check for him
I done seen the best of men drunk reading New Testament
All these niggas pussy, trust me, I can peep the estrogen
Keep the heater tucked, it clean you up just like it's Mexican
Narcs was text messaging, if you cop no less than ten
Hustle with my next of kin, bless them like your reverend
Pussies packed with heroin, I done seen some spooky shit
You know we shot your man, but you ain't had the heart to do this shit
I earn for keeps, disturb the peace, I feel like Ludacris
I swerve in Jeeps, time to burn the streets for all this foolishness
Niggas jeans still tight, guess you dressing European
Smoking dust in your dutch
They tried to rob, they heard I'm rein'

[Hook]
The stove on, flame rising, baking soda ready
I got the work, watch it cook, time to go already
The way I'm moving through these streets, they think I'm on already
I know we might look light, but trust, we more than heavy

The stove on, flame rising, baking soda ready
I got the work, watch it cook, time to go already
The way I'm moving through these streets, they think I'm on already
I know we might look light, but trust, we more than heavy

[Verse 2]
Twenty-eight grams in an ounce
Thirty-six o's in a kilo, my connect like El Chapo
Nephew name was Carleto
Drop me off in that pot, let me dry on that napkin
Then chop me up on that plate
After that you should get to bagging
The epidemic, we pushing limits
Take over buildings, like fuck the tenents, won't leave no witness
This shit ridiculous, I seen mothers change they pipe before they change they daughter diaper
Trips to the island, back and forth, just touring Rikers
Money spinning off the pen, see I'm a threat to all the writers
Foreign women, thick and slim, let's get 'em in, they all are like us
Drought came in, strip was rocking, connect was changing all the prices
Them dykes was sure to hype him, flashing lights was all enticing

[Hook]
The stove on, flame rising, baking soda ready
I got the work, watch it cook, time to go already
The way I'm moving through these streets, they think I'm on already
I know we might look light, but trust, we more than heavy

The stove on, flame rising, baking soda ready
I got the work, watch it cook, time to go already
The way I'm moving through these streets, they think I'm on already
I know we might look light, but trust, we more than heavy
