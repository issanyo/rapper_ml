[Intro]
I need everything I came for
Joe Joe got 'em again
And some
Prosper
I'm tryna live prosper
Prosper
I'm tryna live
I'm just tryna live

[Verse 1]
I just pray that I'm livin' prosperous
Comin' from conditions that's moderate to accomplishin'
Each goal I ever set, that check off my bucket list
Know who you fuckin' with, you can't suck it baby just swallow it
Prosper, "P" for the pussy been gettin' thrown at me
"R" for the Rollie that Nas got me, the sky dweller (my nigga)
"O" for the ounces, I drove the most to the mountains (most)
"S" is for the sour, I sold to niggas in housin' (got it)
"P" is for that pack of that Newports that I couldn't never smoke (never)
"E" is for the easy-pass, get nervous when I pass the toll, pack a pole, pack a stick back on my shit
I been through the worst, it don't matter shit got me rich
Story I could tell, I could still remember the smell
Of my cell, thought I was in hell, hit mama for mail
I had CO's that I wanted to hurt, I'm speedin' fast, I just wanna reverse
Get some fame behind your name and they gon' come at you worse
I've seen friends go to the essence, they left blood on my shirt
And I can't never get them stains out
Try and understand what this pain 'bout
Half deaf in my left ear from them shots that done rang out
I'm tryna own property, put my daughter through private school
Fiends was our neighbors, then mama told us, we gotta move
I thought I knew it all, couldn't pay me to follow rules
Almost lost my life for some Prada shoes, you gotta choose

[Chorus]
Is dying worth everything you done lived for?
Ran out of Arm & Hammer, get more, was piss poor
I can't even add up all the clothing stores we ripped off
I gotta get fresh, it was so hard to get them zips off
I smoke a lot, see a opp, spot 'em like a polka dot
Always in the gutter like I bowl a lot
Open up the Rover top, blow up fifty bag to the heavens
Kept a mask plus a weapon, I ain't know if I was gon' blow or not

[Verse 2]
I never knew 'bout no fame or no movement (never)
Now I'm recruitin' lieutenants, my women friends they was in there boostin'
She must of loved me, she put this onion up in the coochie
Played games, my youngest one fades and not the one on Boosie
Heavenly scented, the Dodger was rented
Tryna prosper by any means, I'm Malcolm in a Detroit fitted
I got the scars from my life of war
I love the rap, but I don't like the talk
I get excited if the white is soft (powder)
I push the Porsche until the pipes exhaust
Ain't got no felonies, get a license for it
So many thoughts got me thinkin' like, "Shit, I might record this"
The couch was leather, the floor was cold and the phone was cordless
Talkin' my mother crib, ounces in my dresser
The cash in my Timberland box, keep all that extras
The one they loved the most, kidnap 'em, they'll get the message
Stay down 'til you come up, you'll get your blessings

[Chorus]
Is dying worth everything you done lived for?
Ran out of Arm & Hammer, get more, was piss poor
I can't even add up all the clothing stores we ripped off
I gotta get fresh, it was so hard to get them zips off
I smoke a lot, see a opp, spot 'em like a polka dot
Always in the gutter like I bowl a lot (always)
Open up the Rover top (open), blow up fifty bag to the heavens
Kept a mask plus a weapon, I ain't know if I was gon' blow or not

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
It's the kid with the glow, I get it and go
Say I talk fast, you just listenin' slow
Prosper
You know, get what you gotta get while you here man
Do what you do, like you're doing it for TV or
You know, whatever you're doing it for man, lotta money to be made, make sure you make it
Don't waste no more time, time tickin'
I can't even see what time it is on the Philipe, but you know
Catch up, what you want, the money or the respect?
Pick one
Prosper
Joe Joe got 'em again
