Girl you're the one that holds me down
When no one else is around
You're the type of woman I'll give a crown
If time ever, time ever stop
I know you gon' know you gon' rock
Cause you're the on to hold me down

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Uh, time after time
Only one been on my mind
I'm relaxing in the back seat
I might be in the club every night
Heavy ice, other women don't attract me
Certified, made it on my own
Anytime I need a ride you pull over like a taxi
Sundress showing off your curves
From the 'burbs but she ghetto, she been listening to Max B
Anything I got I'mma split it
Got your got so committed, foreign drop, I could get it
AMG I'm driving, you shotgun
I ain't wasting time tryna find something real when I got one
A lot of these women basic, you not one
You even get me out of trouble when the cops come
Huh, that's a down ass chick
If you broke please don't come around that chick

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Girl you're the one that holds me down
When no one else is around
You're the type of woman I'll give a crown
If time ever, time ever stop
I know you gon' know you gon' rock
Cause you're the on to hold me down

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I salute
I've never been in love, but I'm neutral
My man told me you was the one when I introduced you
Trust me, I know I ain't the type you been use to
Got my own money, not that type that'll use you
Slide through, jet ski, South Beach, Collins Ave
Brand new bag, I don't know what the amount reach
V.I.P. lit Louis kicks where the couch be
Champagne spilling while these women just surround me
Nothing can compare what we share
When we walk in, everybody stare, I promise it ain't fair
Killing every outfit she put on
You wanna talk to here but you scared
Her presence is a gift, she get dressed up to take a pic
Just to hold her down I'll take a risk
Maybach, I'm laid back, just getting bit
Told her bring a friend with her just so I can make them kiss

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Girl you're the one that holds me down
When no one else is around
You're the type of woman I'll give a crown
If time ever, time ever stop
I know you gon' know you gon' rock
Cause you're the on to hold me down
