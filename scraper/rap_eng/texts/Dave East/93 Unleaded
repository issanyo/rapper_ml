Yeah

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Fill like it's 93 (I ain't tryna gas you up)
Baby, come ride with me (I ain't tryna gas you up)
You just so fly to me (I ain't tryna gas you up)
I just feel like you the one, you the one, I can patch you up
Fill like it's 93 (I ain't tryna gas you up)
Baby, come ride with me (I ain't tryna gas you up)
You just so fly to me (I ain't tryna gas you up)
I just feel like you the one, you the one, I can't pass you up, no no no

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Look at your hair, look at your clothes
Yeah, look at your nails, check out your toes, yeah
Body on slow mo, come here
You got a nigga froze like a lil baby deer (God damn)
Ooh, baby girl, you're cool like this time of year
Girl, you hot as motherfuckin' fish grease, yeah
You don't need a chair, sit it down right here
And if you want it all, you can get that there
Say you like to read, let me get between them pages
Know you like to work out, I can spot while you squat
Know these other girls, they ainâ€™t got what you got
Tryna fill your tank 'til the top

Money, I got plenty, girl, it's nothin', I could spend it all on you
Yeah, winter, spring, summer, yeah, make the money fall, fall on you
Yeah, money, I got plenty, girl, it's nothin', I could spend it all on you

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ay, look at your body, wait, look in my eyes
Ay, picture my face, ay, between your thighs
Ay, my lips on yours, drip, drip some more
All of my time, I'm goin' down
Tryna find your spot, I'm tryna keep it there (ay, ay)
I be goin' deep, so baby, be prepared
Super direct, no disrespect, yeah

[Verse 3: Dave East]
93, you gotta fuck wanna ride with me
I look like I hit the lottery, only with niggas that die for me
I used to be at with all the hammers and all the scammers and all where the powder be
You hated, so fuck your apology, you see that red stripe on my Prada tee
I jump out the Rover now, fully loaded
Ain't hard to see, I've been took over now
Same bitches wouldn't even pay attention
I can bend them over, choke 'em now
Bottom of my teeth golden now
Only backwoods, I can roll a pound
Homies locked, I can hold 'em down
Got Givenchy stars on my shoulder now
New grib, new bitch, true Crip, whip like a bowlin' ball
Yves Saint Laurent or the Dolce shades, I don't even know though, sure
Only if she bad I might see it, full of Henny, so I might eat it
Only socks and my wife beater, her brain better than a mind reader

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Fill like it's 93 (I ain't tryna gas you up)
Baby, come ride with me (I ain't tryna gas you up)
You just so fly to me (I ain't tryna gas you up)
I just feel like you the one, you the one, I can patch you up
Fill like it's 93 (I ain't tryna gas you up)
Baby, come ride with me (I ain't tryna gas you up)
You just so fly to me (I ain't tryna gas you up)
I just feel like you the one, you the one, I can't pass you up, no no no

[Outro: Dave East & Trey Songz]
Money, I got plenty, girl, it's nothin', I could spend it all on you
Yeah, winter, spring, summer, yeah, make the money fall, fall on you
Yeah, money, I got plenty, girl, it's nothin', I could spend it all on you, (I just feel like you the one)
Yeah, winter, spring, summer, yeah, make the money fall, fall on you
