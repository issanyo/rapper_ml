[Intro: RetcH]
Yo, yo, yo, ha, yeah, yeah, yo
Uh, ay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[?] shit, man
Gave my shawty a lil burner, shit
Put my bitch in all that Prada shit
Uh, uh, yo

[Verse 1: RetcH]
We was starving in the projects, wasn't making progress
Started scamming, we was praying that the payment process
I had some friends that died young, the hard pain to digest
She made me wanna pour some drank, got some empty spot yet
I hear a whole lot of talk, why ain't nobody pop yet?
Pistol back a nigga up like that morning hot breath
Hit some new shit from Givenchy I ain't get to cop yet
Outfit 5 bands, sneakers, they ain't even dropped yet
I ain't never had a stylist, all my shit from Paris
And I'd be damned to let a bitch play me like I'm average
I'm tryna use Google Maps without getting thrown in traffic
I was supposed to take the exit, bitch made me pass it
I fell in love with money when I touched that raw 'caine
Shit, I just got some cheesecake on my Balmain
And I bust my own gun, I just run with the shooters
The other day, they kicked me out for tryna fuck in the Uber
I used to serve out the taxi, tryna evade the cops
And I be taking lean naps rocking Saint Laurent
Bitches overstepping boundaries, shorty, play your part
I be dipped in all designer while I browse for art
Margiela, Lo, Prada, Louis, and Gabana
I press the button, have my youngins come and wet your block up
I don't just be anywhere, I gotta keep my stock up
I'm in first class tripping, tryna pour this Wock up

[Chorus: RetcH]
Take a look into the mind
Story of a young nigga
That's just how we tryna get it
Niggas tryna block me out my shine
But I ain't taking no shorts
No, I ain't gon' let 'em know
My paranoia got me peeking out the blinds
I swear somebody be watching
These niggas talking, so I gotta be cautious
I gotta stay up on my grind
I blow these niggas, gon' hate me
So it's on me and I got it off safety, nigga

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I never take a day off, you can't compare me to Ferris
Virgil got me in this Lou Vuitton shit, I'm staying in Paris
I had grams from my passport, ever cleared to go to France
I still can't get into Canada, we rob you and your manager
I'm in the ocean blue foreign, the coroner got your dental work
You don't want no candles, and your entire hood getting shirts
You going through it, your bitch upset you can't even get a purse
They called me Hollywood when I started charging 'em 10 a verse
I don't want it if I ain't the nigga that's gon' get it first
We reading ya 'cause it's social media, you gon' get it worse
I'm 'bout to charter flights, that's Italian, in first class, eat spaghetti
My young niggas told me they like how I'm styling 'em
My older niggas said get money, they don't like when I'm wilding
Your shit trash, we break down weed and rolling dice on your album
Xannies kept me afloat, every other night made a thousand
Shooter told me just by the store, ain't got no time for no browsing
Look at they wardrobe, they gotta be gimmicks
Been broke most of my life, you talking money, I just gotta be in it
I flex on these niggas, I'm acting like a lottery winner
I ain't Mexican, cheese and chips, was eating nachos for dinner

[Chorus: RetcH]
Take a look into the mind
Story of a young nigga
That's just how we tryna get it
Niggas tryna block me out my shine
But I ain't taking no shorts
No, I ain't gon' let 'em know
My paranoia got me peeking out the blinds
I swear somebody be watching
These niggas talking, so I gotta be cautious
I gotta stay up on my grind
I blow these niggas, gon' hate me
So it's on me and I got it off safety, nigga
