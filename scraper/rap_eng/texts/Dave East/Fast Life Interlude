[Hook]
I popped the perky like Motrin
It got me right back in motion
New condo right by the ocean
I been that nigga since '06
I don't got time for no broke shit
My niggas, they pull up and smoke shit
I roll up that dope, make you choke, shit
I'm young, I'm rich, and I'm focused

[Verse]
I got a pill in my system, I'm numb, I'm numb, I give her that dope dick
I don't got time for no prison, my niggas is bidden, that shit got me so sick
Pay attention who you roll with
Same nigga you used to smoke with
Same nigga you could get smoked with
These bodies got young niggas open
I hustle right by the feds
I got your wife giving head
I sleep with my knife by the bed
I'm living life on the edge
Used to sleep with my gun in the sheets
Thinking back, I had nothing to eat
Catch a flight and go fuck on a freak
Wifey tight, I ain't fuck in a week
Now they just love when I speak
These haters don't want me to breathe
I pay my hitters to go get you niggas, that's almost 100 a week
I made 100 this week
Half of it I give it to my daughter
Neck and my wrist look like flooded water
It ain't hard to tell, I'm from the border
Nowadays, I bet your mother on it
After I hit it, my cousin on it
Street nigga, I come from the corner
Please don't have my young boy run up on ya
30s with ladders up in 'em
You know they got savage up in 'em
I'm tryna marry a million
Got evicted out my building
You don't know about embarrassment
Cousin up north with the heroin
I had to go down to Maryland
We bagged up the weed at the Sheradon
White girl, call it Carol, nigga
Don't come around, if you ain't thorough, nigga
Know my name in every bale nigga
Keep away from me, you want your girl nigga
Give a fuck about my ex, lets run up a check and ball today
None of my bitch's is boring, I pull up in foreign, they all gon' hate
Got no time to talk today, hit him and walk away
My youngin', he ain't got no license but he know how to park a wraith
Free trap, free scrap
Charlie and Bully and Mack out
You've never been in a crack house
I'm backstage with the mac out
I throw them ones once the ass out
I smoke the dope 'til I pass out
Lets run up a check on these niggas, I flex on these niggas, they know I'ma cash out
