Hocus pocus but ain’t no magic
Bitch on my savage shit, like
Fuck what your status is, packages we unravel it
Oh god, I know times was hard, but just keep that ratchet clean
For my love, she would back of flip cross, bitches immaculate
Me and bully, he got that fully
And we ain’t playing, then she text me say she love me
Got mad because I ain’t say it back
I was influenced by drug dealers, see the way I act
They clap at me I’m spraying back
But she just can’t relate to that

Now you thinking long, let me run this song
Then I’ma leave alone
See I can get it, I can get it
I could get it
But I ain’t on to make em see me on, blow
See I admit it, I throw it all up
All up, and let it fall off, over
Ok I ball up, never fall
Got my guap up, never stallin
Soon as I show up got groupies
Tryina boo me like apollo
We gonn hit that club tonight girl
Outfit looking right girl
That body looking tight girl
Knock out you causing fights girl

So you can catch us in that vip
Champagne showers, see, we do this, every night
It’s just me and my fucking team
So many hoes in here, why you worry bout me
Money flowin constantly, it’s a fuckin movie

Now you thinking long, let me run this song
Then I’ma leave alone
See I can get it, I can get it
I could get it
But I ain’t on to make em see me on, blow
See I admit it, I throw it all up
All up, and let it fall off, over
Fall all over

These streets got me feeling like I can't leave
My felture fire burning, want that ring to make your hand freeze
Banshees we used to ride, hustlers we used to pise
Never would confuse your eyes, I look at you like family
8 am I'm baggin up, I'm makin sure this rent is paid
You stressin out, plus my niggas starvin, ain't no venom man
Studying the blueprint, press repeat on renegade
She knows my heart is with the block and cause of that she been afraid

Now you thinking long, let me run this song
Then I'mma leave alone
See I can get it, I can get it
I could get it
But I ain't on to make em see me on, blow
See I admit it, I throw it all up
All up, and let it fall off, over
Ok I ball up, never fall
