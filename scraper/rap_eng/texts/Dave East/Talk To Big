[Verse 1]
I got niggas that's never comin' home (never)
Bitches say they love my music, don't know none of my songs (none)
I guess poverty changed me, I was a decent kid (I was cool)
On my most recent bid, I had a dream I could speak to Big (Biggie)
Harlem, ain't nowhere like it (nowhere)
I fell in love with new records 'cause all my homies liked it
Chick from parole was light-skinned
She got my bro indicted (my nigga), now he up north, I write him (I wrote him)
Trust me I know the prices (I know), looked at my homie lifeless (he dead)
I need some shit I can feel, nobody touch me
I say I'm meant to be here, the doctors say that I'm lucky (that's what they say)
My cousin was a custy, he used to stick up to get high
He robbed a corner bodega on camera, had to sit five
Came home talkin' that jail shit, he got his weight up
Like niggas is frail but still he just couldn't sell shit
Youngins got the block sewed up like rugby patches
They hate you when you go get it yourself, they love you askin' (they love it)
Know you starvin', they throw you rations
Wonder why his stomach grumblin'
Shawty come from nothing, ain't never have shit (nothin')
His father in the mountains, his mother just want a pill tonight
The only motivation he ever had was to steal a bike
Something in his system was different, just wasn't feeling right (at all)
4AM phone call, his cousin got killed tonight
He tryna double back on the last time that he heard his voice
Can't be indecisive, these streets will help you to learn your choice (they'll help you)
Back to Bentleys, back to the trenches nigga (back 'em up)
My digits bigger, I smoke with Nas and I build with Jigga (true story)
A true artist, you could never paint a realer picture (never)
Convinced your sister to twist her, just had to spill some liquor (lil Henney)
A new rapper, ask 'bout new rappers, I don't feel them niggas
I chill with women, they chill with niggas, they different niggas
In the field so long, these Timberlands, made a killin' in them
I benefitted from plenty hitters, they still my niggas (my niggas)
When Master P was yellin' ice cream man
My uncle got caught with 19 grams, if you don't like me, damn
How you gon' hate me, I ain't had shit in the 'frigerator
Now it's royal silk from molded bread and spoiled milk

[Interlude]
I know they gon' hate y'all
I know they gon' hate y'all
I know they gon' hate y'all

[Verse 2]
The time it took me to make it here
Tell me how the fuck I'ma make it fair for a hater
I know these niggas ain't playin' fair (I know)
Murder let you know this shit is real and we can take it there
Couldn't afford them Jordans, had to take a pair (give me those)
I done seen the toughest niggas freeze up (freeze)
Hammer just left 'em shakin' there, this shit feel like a lion tryna race a bear
You niggas'll never catch me, it's probably gon' take a year (whole year)
Top ten, bitch I'm locked in, like Jamaican hair (locked in)
Headshots, used to be a scope, I put a laser there
Put newspaper on the carpet, hear who walkin'
I don't trust these voices talking or the walls in my apartment
It's getting darker, pistol under the parka
Imagine, pourin' Fruity Pebbles and roaches fall out (ill)
Make you wanna go to court, shoot the judge before you walk out
Make you wanna eat a nigga food, just pull a fork out
I be doin' push ups in my cell before I talk 'bout
Anything we involved in, criminal code (criminal)
Ex-bitches ready for war, they some militant hoes
Coke in the flesh, this that shit you feel in your nose
You college niggas come see how it feel to chill with a pro (pro)
Could never compare, you don't know how it feel to be broke (you don't know)
Just tryna get high, niggas you feed and stealing your smoke
Can never punch her but when I fuck her she still can get choked (come here)
First verse was the struggle, I bubbled right off a ink ball
8-ball with all black diamonds, I bet they hate y'all (they hate y'all)
That money, know they gon' hate y'all (hate y'all)
