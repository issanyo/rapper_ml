[Intro]
Shit different this time around man
Feelin' myself a lil' more
They told me I'm that nigga

[Chorus]
I guess the real ones never pose to make it
I'm floating so different they suppose to hate it
So amazing let this be yo motivation
I smoke too much dope I can't be on probation
Every night a different city different chick
Same niggas never with no different click
God given this shit a gift
Pull up on the block like I just hit a lick

[Verse 1]
Diamonds with that Cuban fuck they pride up
I seen they face so much confusion when I slide up
Indecisive coppin product make ya mind up
The Feds rush like clocks up in the wall nigga ya times up
Harlem's finest pardon my timing they talkin nonsense
Ignore my conscious double Park in front the narcs with chronic
No need to battle he rattin' since first grade he tattle
Since Shawn Kemp play for Seattle I come from the gravel
My arm stronger no barbel
Fifty shots lick hear em all yell
Clickin off park cells
I want the ice cream plus the cake nigga carvel
Hustlin' by myself cause they get knocked bet they all tell
??? Snuck the burner in
Jury brought the verdict in
You dieting my niggas rioting like this is Ferguson
Burberry slim got 'em sick, they feelings hurt again
Rob you for your pack I guess you gotta go back to work again

[Chorus]
I guess the real ones never pose to make it
I'm floating so different they suppose to hate it
So amazing let this be yo motivation
I smoke too much dope I can't be on probation
(Light it!!!!!)
Every night a different city different chick
Same niggas never with no different click
God given this shit a gift
Pull up on the block like I just hit a lick

Verse 2]
Ebonics talk I'm rare like seeing a fly saucer
See you addicted to sniffin' but boo them lines cost ya
Supply thought ya I often was popped often, lets off em we pop often like orphans some got lost now I'm boss
Come get employed here
Hear the critics talkin' like Dave east done had a strong year, I just give a long stare
No emotion, paper slowly grossin'
I'm overdosing on some potion
So I'm focused I gotcha open like
7 11 seven weapons my young bitch undressin'
Block stack Tetris bring the mobster clean up messes
Vegas strip tryn'a play the strip hopped across the desert
New desert eagle evil speaking to me got me stressing
You can always catch me with it
Like Joe Budden with them vests
I was hustlin' every second, tryn'a fuck up every section
I'm the Gucci Louis Fendi type
Every nights a Henny night
Was tryn'a get my penny's right, so I can cop them penny's white

[Chorus]
I guess the real ones never pose to make it
I'm floating so different they suppose to hate it
So amazing let this be yo motivation
I smoke too much dope I can't be on probation
Every night a different city different chick
Same niggas never with no different click
God given this shit a gift
Pull up on the block like I just hit a lick
Pull up on the block like I just hit a lick
