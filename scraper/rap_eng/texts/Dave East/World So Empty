[Verse 1: ReachingNOVA]

I know I said I'd never change, but all has failed to remain since the last time you'd probly hear me say it
Nothing in it's place where I left it, only words when I write it
Never walked on the water but lord I've walked on the fire
The young god is no liar, to your pool I'm a diver
To your car I'm a driver, to your flight I'm the pilot
To your girl I'm her miles, check her files yourself
Not that it matters, see the fact is I'm just trying to help
So when you fail in life you learn to not be mad at yourself
I learned from V when times are hard my nigga tighten your belt
Cus we lose bitches we love, love niggas we lose
If you live in indecision then that decision you choose
Only difference 'tween a Catholic and Christian are written views
Dog it's hard to do religion while always breaking the rules
Please do as you choose, my nigga I'm living life
If you think I'm living wrong, please tell me what's living right
Do consider your opinion ain't valid unless you might
Have a walk inside my Nike's' and see what it's really like
And I, think it's 'bout time we reacquaint
Hope you never think you're everything you ain't

Hey young world, wanna hear a story?
Live to tell the tale Cus no one can tell it for me

(JAY Z:Sample)
Under God's grey skies
My lyrics is like Bible, made to save lives
In the midst of all your misery nigga, stay fly

(ReachingNOVA)
Uh, it's do or die my nigga, now who am I?
NOVA

(JAY Z:Sample)
The more things change the more they stay the same
Who am i to change the game?


[Verse 2: Dave East]

Light It!
You can smell it when you walk by me
Dej Loaf "Try Me", insides so cloud
I can get your boss robbed
Leave all of your workers hogtied
Then I copt the Benz frog-eye
This vintage Chanel, I come from hell
Free Biggavel, Grand crew they no longer cell
We can get the Remy though I'm tasting like a check
The reason your bitch is wet might do to Versace sweats
My nigga Mac was doing videos in Panama
Potent in the building don't you dare turn them cameras off
I'm starting to model my aura like David Beckham
Cool calm collected, but keep a shooter to stretch 'em
I inhale kush, exhale a check
Bitches think it's "Waiting to exhale", I'm on the next
Intimidated, seen them tats up on my neck
They know I fuck with Nas now they put me on a jet
I'm looking for a brand new hunnit
Always making movies bring them cams through front-end
D's was looking for us, brought them vans through hunting
Take her from Philippe's, told them I don't want no onions

[Verse 3: ReachingNOVA]

Whatever comes of this life, understand that I earned it
Whether they think I deserve it, I'm asking God for discernment
Pastor giving a sermon, I'm absent from churches
While I ask for forgiveness, you'll hear regret in my verses
To be successful is stressful, I'll do whatever it takes
I'm being Frank, Rags to riches nigga
Money in banks, I'm giving thanks
To these women giving blanks, her hero is what I ain't
I agree with what you think, my nigga I'm pretty great
Still I question destiny like "Is music really my fate?"
I'm patient Jesus I'm wait
Like a server to your plate, I'm giving more than I take
And I always try to learn especially from mistakes
If I bust my ass now my family should be straight
This beat is just a canvas, my words are considered paint
I'm twenty eight, now ain't the time that I wanna play
Not invested in these hoes, they never appreciate
You make 'em cum once forever they wanna stay, late
Unlike my bank, pussy I never Chase
And I, think it's 'bout time we reacquaint
Hope you never think you're everything you ain't
