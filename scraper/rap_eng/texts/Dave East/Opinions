Intro/Chorus:
I'm just trying to get this dough (just tryna get it, yeah)
Every other city I go (every other city)
Every other dollar I see (every dollar)
I'm just trying to get this dough (trying to get it)
Tell them niggas watch and see (watch me nigga)
Every other city I go (tell these niggas man)
Every other dollar I see (East Side, El Barrio)
I'm just trying to get this dough (Harlem, yeah)
Tell them niggas watch and see

Verse 1: [Dave East]
Everybody got opinions like an iPhone
We buy chrome, certain blocks you couldn't ride on
Dollar vans, Jamaica Ave for the tan Timbs
Still wondering if Allah forgive when man sin (Inshallah)
I'm about a bankroll, small paper beat it
Humble but conceited, ain't none of these niggas needed
Approach me like a king when I'm greeted
Gang members throwing up their set, guess they're bulimic
From a block never talk about it, if you ain't see it
Fuck the cops, I ain't never hustle backwards so roll up the Backwoods
Ravenswood burning on fire, the D's pressing
Relocate it back Uptown, pass me my crown
They say the head of king is heavy, stacking green fully loaded magazine 'case your team get jelly
Knock em off asking for change like a scene in Belly
How the fuck they match my bars, never seen a celly
Tell ya team get ready

Chorus 2X: [Dave East/Floyd Miles]
Every other city I go (every other city)
Every other dollar I see (I need this money)
I'm just trying to get this dough (trying to get it)
Tell them niggas watch and see (watch how I do this man)
Every other city I go (New York, LA)
Every other dollar I see (Yeah)
I'm just trying to get this dough (This money)
Tell them niggas watch and see (Yeah)

Verse 2: [Dave East]
Shrimp and lobster, aura like a pimp or mobster
Pick the chopper, make him go and switch his roster
Feel like the sickest when I kick it, go and get the doctor
Getting chicken, now they looking at me different FAWK EM!
Young and buck em, I'm tryna Lamborghini truck 'em
Nothing pull that foreign out, your bitch is fucking
Play the back, getting smacked with crystal button
Pump it up, still I'm focused like I'm Joseph Budden
I was fucked up for a long time, I'm talking struggling
You ain't talking 'bout no money, you ain't talking nothing
I already fucked her sister, tryna hit her cousin
Acting like y'all get it cracc'ing but y'all niggas bluffing
Fill that Tahoe up with birds, then we call it stuffing
Wavy cuffing, that bitch is really so disgusting
She was naked in the condo, woke up baking muffins
Pack a number nine like Rondo for you niggas fronting

Chorus 2X: [Dave East/Floyd Miles]
Every other city I go (every other city)
Every other dollar I see (all this money)
I'm just trying to get this dough (all I'm trying to do man)
Tell them niggas watch and see (watch)
Every other city I go (Harlem)
Every other dollar I see (Yeah)
I'm just trying to get this dough (East Side)
Tell them niggas watch and see (Watch how I do it)
Yeah uhh
