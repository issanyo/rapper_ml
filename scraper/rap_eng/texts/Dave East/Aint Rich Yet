[Intro: Dave]
Trav waddup nigga, beat that case boy
...4 in the morning (*flat line*)

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I got some work in the freezer
Model bitch she's from Belize
I've never been open of pussy, you niggas is rookies pillow talking to a freak
Feel I'm dental flossing every beat, I be in spots, money coming in quick
Avion shots I got it from Jeezy Trap Or Die, shit we riding in a geezy
We do what we wanna do not what we tryna do, don't let them lie to you
I come from where niggas will follow you, as soon as you slide out that barbecue
I'm realer then most I chill with my locs, I'm falling asleep on a model bitch
I caught her out the streets on some toddler shit, aim'll get more respect then a dollar will
She hear my voice and she get wet, I've been feeling like a big threat
On your tenth date you ain't hit yet? , you been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet?

[Verse 2: Profit]
Broke as fuck yeah I know they stress, how they do it? how they do it? how they do it?
I've been thinking 'bout some Peter Lugers, or them Big Macs we been going through it
It's a different beef when you getting bags, niggas envious when they should be giving daps
She just sucked me but she's probably mad, because these hoes commenting they ain't falling back
Now i'm in [?] coming from the [?] if you had lawyers you had the same troubles
Gucci collar with logo hidden, I remain [?] we been tryna bubble
Like bad soap, Jordan box where the stash go, in them blocks where they trap or die and the fruits of labor they can't post
Feds watching plus the hoes gossip, they'll line you up like they hanging cloths
I was holdin' dope on that 9-5 with that work with them I know I'm trippin'
Money calling' they placing orders, so I had to get, had to get it ain't seen me yet but ima hurt their feelings
O-Dog breaks so they know I'm menace, they like he gone kill 'em

[Chorus: Dave East]
She hear my voice and she get wet, I've been feeling like a big threat
On your tenth date you ain't hit yet?, you been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet?
She hear my voice and she get wet, on your tenth date you ain't hit yet!
I been feeling like a big threat, you been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet!
She hear my voice and she get wet, I've been feeling like a big threat, on your tenth date you ain't hit yet?
You been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet?
She hear my voice and she get wet, I've been feeling like a big threat, on your tenth date you ain't hit yet!
You been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet!

[Verse 3:]
Been on drugs fuck a piss test, got his wifey with me having rich sex
Hammers throwing shells ain't no chins checked, we done [?] chrome, fuck a rim set
Drug money from the studios, I might pay a nigga just to hold the dope
They gon' hang they self I don't need a rope, in the wrong place when that nina flow
And you S-O-L I was eating Ramens 'fore I seen a cell
Alley ways and them back cuts I done seen them cells
Niggas back up because you might see hell
Brown water sippin' Holy Grail, you stay inside you never seen a cell
Vac-seal the product so the scent safe, paid the white bitch just to sent the [?]

[Bridge:]
Been on drugs fuck a piss test, got his wifey with me having rich sex
Hammers throwing shells ain't no chins checked, we done [?] chrome, fuck a rim set
Drug money from the studios, I might pay a nigga just to hold the dope
They gon' hang they self I don't need a rope, in the wrong place when that nina flow
Been on drugs fuck a piss test, got his wifey with me having rich sex
Hammers throwing shells ain't no chins checked, we done [?] chrome, fuck a rim set
Drug money from the studios, I might pay a nigga just to hold the dope
They gon' hang they self I don't need a rope, in the wrong place when that nina flow

[Chorus: Dave East]
She hear my voice and she get wet, I've been feeling like a big threat
On your tenth date you ain't hit yet?, you been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet?
She hear my voice and she get wet, on your tenth date you ain't hit yet!
I been feeling like a big threat, you been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet!
She hear my voice and she get wet, I've been feeling like a big threat, on your tenth date you ain't hit yet?
You been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet?
She hear my voice and she get wet, I've been feeling like a big threat, on your tenth date you ain't hit yet!
You been trappin' for years you ain't rich yet!
