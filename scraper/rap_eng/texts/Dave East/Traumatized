This a Leekeleek banger

[Intro: Dave East & DJ Holiday]
There's a power of pressure Dave
Tomorrow ain't promised
Holiday season, it's Karma 2 nigga, ain't no going back
I lost Malik at 29, Mugga at 22
From Harlem to Atlanta, fuck you talking 'bout
Just happy to be here


[Pre-Chorus: Dave East & DJ Holiday]
Killed freaky, I was traumatized
Still that nigga in my momma's eyes (they gon' feel this shit)
Try to see a nigga momma cry
All this money, don't matter when your homies is dying (oh they gon' feel this shit)
Ain't trying to be a homicide
Trying to see a nigga momma I don't trust a soul
Trying to see ya lil momma cry (let's go)

[Chorus: Dave East]
They killed Freaky, I was traumatized, still that nigga in my momma's eyes
Try to see a nigga momma cry, I ain't trying to be a homicide
I got a daughter plus a little brother and my momma that I gotta be here for
Bitch told me stop buying guns, niggas dying fuck you think I need 'em for

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Blue and whites, flashing lights, I ain't going back fuck you think I'm speeding for
I got homies I don't see at all, best friends I can't even call
I ain't laughing ain't nothing funny, if you talking money shit I need it all
My youngin' died and I need my dog
Devil on me, try to keep him off
Mood swings, I got mood swings
Move wrong and this tool sing
Shooter came up on that new thing
I could hold it with a shoestring
They put my youngin' on the news, looking for a Xan I got the blues
We was in there robbing niggas Locs
Take him out his coat, I got his shoes
I go to prison, I ain't coming home
We on a mission, niggas running home
My youngin' airing shit for free
He ain't want the money, stashed a couple hundred for him
He'll do it for a Rollie, take him to my jeweler, know I'm a flood it for him
My vision is blurry, I just hope that I get to see thirty
I pray for another morning
Wake up with your bitch, she got nothing on
I still wanna kill Freaky's killer
I'm in my feelings, I won't speak to niggas
My homies dying I'ma need a minute
Broad daylight, if forever running to 'em, I won't even see the witness
Blowed out on a Sunday, I'm high on the Oneway and I don't even see the speeding limit
Pac prolly had the same feelin', Biggie prolly had the same feelin'
Alot of sucker shit I ain't feelin', I'm blowing sour out the Range ceilin'
Niggas really got me hot, catch him in the drop, trying to leave his brains in it
We never shaky and we ain't timid, ya momma lobby, I be waiting in it

[Chorus: Dave East]
They killed Mugga, I was traumatized, still that nigga in my momma's eyes
Tryna see a nigga momma cry, I ain't trying to be a homicide
Got a daughter plus a little brother and my momma that I gotta be here for
Bitch told me stop buying guns, niggas dying fuck you think I need 'em for
They killed Freaky, I was traumatized, still that nigga in my momma's eyes
Tryna see a nigga momma cry, I ain't trying to be a homicide
Got a daughter plus a little brother and my momma that I gotta be here for
Hot pistol on my side warming up the ride, feeling like the heater on

[Verse 2: Kiing Shooter]
They killed Ruger, bitch it's time to slide
All my niggas know it's homicide
Catch 'em lacking and they gotta die
I'm sending niggas to apologize
I don't care if we was cool or we went to school, nigga you an opp too
Catch a nigga by they self, or they with they fam, fuck it they get shot too
Ni-niggas know how I rock nigga
Thirty shots in this Glock nigga
I ain't scared to bend blocks nigga
Send shots while the cops with 'em
I been hype my whole life, dodging blue and white 'cause I don't box niggas
Niggas talkin' like they tough til I pulled up and niggas called the cops on me
Either you scared or pussy, but niggas know I ain't no rookie
I've been in the field since they called me Chill, nigga that's word to Tookie
Beat cases, I've been on my bully
I'm strapped, I stay with the fully
On edge, I dare you to push me, scared, we know that they pussies
They killed Hardy, bitch it's time to slide
All my niggas know it's homicide
Catch 'em lacking and they gotta die
I'm sending niggas to apologize
I don't care if we was cool or we went to school, nigga you an op too
Catch a nigga by they self, or they with they fam, fuck it they get shot too

[Chorus: Dave East]
They killed Mugga, I was traumatized, still that nigga in my momma's eyes
Tryna see a nigga momma cry, I ain't trying to be a homicide
Got a daughter plus a little brother and my momma that I gotta be here for
Bitch told me stop buying guns, niggas dying, fuck you think I need 'em for
They kill freaky, I was traumatized, still that nigga in my momma's eyes
Tryna see a nigga momma cry, I ain't trying to be a homicide
Got a daughter plus a little brother and my momma that I gotta be here for
Hot pistol on my side warming up the ride, feeling like the heater on

[Outro]
Warming up the ride, feeling like the heater on
Warming up the ride, feeling like the heater on
Warming up the ride, feeling like the heater on
Warming up the ride, feeling like the heater on
Bang, bang, bang, bang
