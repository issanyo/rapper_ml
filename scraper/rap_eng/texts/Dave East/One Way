[Intro]
One way, one way, one way

[Verse 1]
I feel like God with an iPhone
Beam with a scope, shoot a mile long
Hit a Molly on a call, hit a dial tone
Henny sippin' by the gallon
I let my daughter get her style on
I got a Mac, shoulder strap on my hip, got the cal on
Lookin' for another opp I can wyle on
Head shot a nigga, leave with a smile on
Off White with the camo
For my nigga light a candle
Im smacked knocking Camp Lo
Perc 30 broke in half, that's a 15
Youngin' I had big dreams, I was like 16
Paint the ceilin' in the crib like it's Sistine
Summer '16 made it to the big screen
I was in the zone tryna cop the whip cream
Bunch of baggies in the crib with like 6 fiends
Reminicin' all the times when I bought work
With that money ain't no reason we should talk first
Smokin' dope in Lascote, that's a golf shirt
Watchin' Narcos I know how the narcs work
Task force used to raid on a Tuesday
Strip club, I'm gettin' paid on a Tuesday
Sour diesel by the bouquet
I used to break down ounces now I'm mixin' Cristal with D'usse

[Hook]
I could get it all if you need
I don't talk, I don't speak, I avoid catchin' cases
Last year I was dead broke
But I told my lil bitch, "don't trip I'ma make it"
Foreign got me feelin' like I'm rich
On my lap got a clip and my aim is amazin'
I ain't been asleep, I've been up
So this money I'ma touch even if I gotta take it
I could get it all if you need
I don't talk, I don't speak, I avoid catchin' cases
Last year I was dead broke
But I told my lil bitch, "don't trip I'ma make it"
Foreign got me feelin' like I'm rich
On my lap got a clip and my aim is amazin'
I ain't been asleep, I've been up
So this money I'ma touch even if I gotta take it

[Verse 2]
Ballin' like I'm Kobe
My bitch look like Khlo√©
You can never know me
Think I'm monster Kody
Never smoked the bogey
Presidential Rollie
Call your bitch a goalie
She be catchin', flexin', watch me kill 'em slowly
Favorite Glock a .40
I looked up to Tony Montana
And I'm realizin' most these rappers phony
Holy matrimony
I got racks up on me
See my status growin'
Got a bag from Sony
Most my family crippin' like what's crackin' homie
I got most the bitches in Manhattan on me
Tryna be my black widow, alimony
Rest in peace to Huddy, rest in peace to Blood
Rollin' up a seven, bitch you just a dub
Ravenswood to Harlem, kept a package on me
Hollywood cool and got an actress on me
She was soakin' wet, flip the mattress over
Ridin' with a chauffeur, I slept on the sofa
Codeine demons got me buyin' soda
Sour dies' schemin' till my time is over
I just need a reason, homie life be over
On my time line bitches talkin' bout they need me
I done been in apartments full of needles
People make promises and never keep 'em
Fuck a conversation, talkin' with this Eagle
Desert like Sahara, Porsche Panamera
Love my Aunt Carol, Gucci my apparel
Sellin' cain, do you like Cousin Harold
Need a million before I have another child
Kairi the greatest
Probably kill you if you try to play us
Rappers on the menu probably most your favorite
See my momma stressin' tryna pay the cable
Ain't no time for waitin'

[Hook]
I could get it all if you need
I don't talk, I don't speak, I avoid catchin' cases

On my lap got a clip and my aim is amazin'
I ain't been asleep, I've been up

I could get it all if you need
I don't talk, I don't speak, I avoid catchin' cases
