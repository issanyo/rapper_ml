[Verse 1: Sevyn Streeter]
Uhh, two, three...
Hey babe, I ain't got no T-shirt on
Hey babe, I ain't got no panties on, no
'Cause I just got out the shower
I just put my lotion on
And you know my skin won't glow for hours
So hurry up and bring your ass home, oh
So you can take me down
After you go down
It's finna go down

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Laying with my back to the ground
Looking at the ceiling like
I remember how we did it
Tell me when to wrap 'em around you
I'll be in my signal for love

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
With my legs throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the peace sign
How you like my peace sign?

[Verse 2: Sevyn Streeter]
Legs in the air, and I got 'em up high right now
Just put it right there
In between my thighs right now, ooh
'Cause I just got out the shower
I just put my lotion on
And you know my skin won't glow for hours
So hurry up and bring your ass home, oh
So you can take me down
After you go down
It's finna go down

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Laying with my back to ground
Looking at the ceiling like
I remember how we did it
Tell me when to wrap 'em around you
I'll be in my signal for love

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
With my legs throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the, throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the, throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the peace sign
How you like my peace sign?

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Take them leggings off
I put the house on you
Baby, I'll bet it all, you light with that makeup
I bet I sweat it off
I lick you from head to toe mama I get it all
Your body taste like water I'm 'bout to take a dive
I ain't into that rushin', I'm bout to take my time
You Keep pulling me closer you got my full attention
Your bottom lip, I get to biting on what you've been missin'
I grab your ankles as I recline
Both legs on my shoulders making the peace sign
You've been talkin' about it so now I need mine
We got the bed wet leaning up while the sheets drying
I hope you know that second round comin'
Sweet tooth for your body, it's like a candy shop
She ain't got on no panties, how could her panties drop?
Got me thinkin' vacations, you need a tan or not?
Told me put on some [?] is you a fan or not

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
With my legs throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the, throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the, throwing up the peace sign
Throwing up the peace sign
How you like my peace sign?

[Outro: Sevyn Streeter]
L-l-legs in the air, air
L-legs in the air, air
L-legs in the air, air
L-l-legs in the air, air
L-legs in the air, air
L-legs in the air, air
