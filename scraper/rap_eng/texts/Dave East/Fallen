[Intro]
Dougie on the beat

[Chorus]
It fell right before I found it
As the quiet before the storm
Tired in the storm, face fallen
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen

[Verse 1: Kur]
I'm findin' happiness within (hell yeah)
I pray a lot more, just askin' God for strength
Whatever's meant is meant, I take it on the chin (yeah, yeah)
Through thick and thin, I been with Coop since Pickering
Back when niggas was rockin' S Dots skullys that had the brim (yeah, yeah)
State Prop, cold Timbs, we young as shit (way back)
Neighbors used to look at us like we ain't shit
I think that's probably the reason I'm numb as shit
Reason I'm poppin' perc after perc, can't even shit  (that's real)
I came straight from the dirt out of the pit (from the dirt)
Hungry as shit after school, we stealin' chips (that's real)
On picture day, Jeff let me borrow his shit, let me borrow his kicks
Shit I wore like a seven, that nigga wore like a six, I still got it to fit (that's real)
Shit I've been through the worst, still poppin' shit
Still lookin' for streps, still lookin' for scrips, for real

[Chorus]
It fell right before I found it
As the quiet before the storm
Tired in the storm, face fallen
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Right, I'm findin' happiness in these pills
I pray to Allah to get me off 'em, but life been real
Before I ever signed a deal
I was in the trenches tryna get my next meal
Yeah, I know how that feel
If you real you rare, if you feel you scared
Shake it off and come with this shit, we runnin' this shit
A hundred rounds and gunnin'
I had hunger pains in my stomach
Now a pair of jeans twelve hundred, I ain't gotta lie
And if he violate the family, then he gotta die (kill 'em)
Went from riding in that Camry, now I gotta fly
I be stuck, no way you can say I'm kinda high
Fear of God, my denim, I hope they got my size
Now I'm buyin' all that shit my mother couldn't get me
Survived a couple shootouts, thankful they couldn't hit me
Robbed in broad daylight, thankful they wouldn't strip me
I spent time doin' nothin', I'm thankful now I'm busy (East)

[Chorus]
It fell right before I found it
As the quiet before the storm
Tired in the storm, face fallen
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen
