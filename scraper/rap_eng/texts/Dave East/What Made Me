[Chorus]
Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
Nas made me want a QB chain
Noriega made me want to do Pharell beats
It's Dark and Hell is Hot dropped and my mood changed
Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
Nas made me want a QB chain
Styles, Kiss, and Sheek had me in the street
50 Cent on repeat on the 2 train

[Verse 1]
The Hot Boys made me want to cop mad toys
Puffy had me wantin' to be a bad boy
Biggie had me wantin' to be a jackboy
Now it's nothing less than 220 on the dashboard
I was taught to give it to him if he asked for it
Nine in your bladder, your dreams shatter like a glass door
Knockin' The Chronic, we started gridin' gettin' bags off
Richie Porter, AZ had me wantin' a black Porsche
Now we on college to get a better team
Skimpin' them baggies, I kept an extra gram
I told Impala, "Keep flyin', I hope we never land"
"All I Need" word for word, I thought I was Method Man
Mary J. Blige on repeat
Leave you dead on vacation, brought the 9 to the beach
I'm my own man, so I don't care what your boy think
DJ Whoo Kid had me feelin' I was Lloyd Banks

[Chorus]
Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
Nas made me want a QB chain
Noriega made me want to do Pharell beats
It's Dark and Hell is Hot dropped and my mood changed
Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
Nas made me want a QB chain
Styles, Kiss, and Sheek had me in the street
50 Cent on repeat on the 2 train

[Verse 2]
On the block, you ain't see it, bitch, you heard about it
I'm havin' conversations with Irv Gotti
No trappin' at momma house, I hit her lobby
Addicted to pain killers, think the Percs got me
Mase had me wantin' to have my waves spinnin'
Too Short told me I should never ever pay women
Youngin' got money, they wonder why he stay grinnin'
Lately been feelin' like Jeter in the 8th inning
Derek, that is on nights I would stare at my fridge
With nothing there, thought I barely would live
Really goin' out my mind, don't know what therapy is
My hitters scarin' the kids, kill and bury the bib
Nas told me they would rush, I'm prepared for the blitz
Rollin' cannabis, watchin' Ellen cannabis clips
What you want, a 50, a dime, gram, or a nick'?
M.O.P had me tellin' niggas, "Hand me your shit, Ante Up"

[Chorus]
Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
Nas made me want a QB chain
Noriega made me want to do Pharell beats
It's Dark and Hell is Hot dropped and my mood changed
Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
Nas made me want a QB chain
Styles, Kiss, and Sheek had me in the street
50 Cent on repeat on the 2 train

[Verse 3]
Pac made me think if I get shot I'ma keep standin'
Big Pun had me really wantin' to speak Spanish
No more oodles and noodles, now we eat salmon
Damn, fifty voices in my head sayin', "Keep gambling"
I came up off that phone tap, Sosa
Escobar style, the fox brown for the culture
Momma had plastic on the sofa, Coogi wrap coasters
Had Fab on the poster

[Chrous]
Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
Nas made me want a QB chain
Noriega made me want to do Pharell beats
It's Dark and Hell is Hot dropped and my mood changed
Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
Nas made me want a QB chain
Styles, Kiss, and Sheek had me in the street
50 Cent on repeat on the 2 train
