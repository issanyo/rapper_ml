[Verse 1]

Now roger that, hah, roger that
I ain't hard to find I'm usually where the models at
In VIP I'm gettin top like a bottlecap
Henny make a nigga curl up like a lobster back
Flow sick, so sick where the doctor at
I ain't fightin over nothin where that choppa at
I don't raise my voice, let that bitch holla back
Money like a drug, nigga I don't got it I relapse
Falacio king, I feel like a stocking cap
And these niggas ain't welcome where we shoppin at
Paper like Jeezy, yeah I get a lotta that
Try an come get me, 650 don't know how to act
Smokin on heartbeat from Long Beach
And a couple firearms stay in arms reach
My tank off E, I'm an owner like Mark C
Your girl wantin me to start her day like I'm coffee
I taste like mocha, great white coca
Vampire flow I killem, day light over
I be in the lab, tryna bake like soda
Doin 225, move them brake lights over
In the field like I'm fightin for my country
I tell my nigga Lil to light it that shit funky
Pockets can't eat, but I keep em both chubby
Light a dub, smile at em I betcha them hoes love me
Hit em, make em copy that
Find me where it's poppin at
Niggas ain't know I could rap now muthafucka roger that
Prada where my closet at, hundreds where my pockets at
Blowin money everyday, my momma like you gotta stack
Haters, don't acknowledge that, NFL I'm prouda that
I am where the loud is at, they took my style I got it back
.40 right beside me too, I ain't tryna ride on you
Sicker than some kinda flu you, you must got me confused
No I'm not the one, dude got me chopped an screwed
Watch where my shottas cruise, everybody gotta move
No I'm not the one, dude got me chopped an screwed
Watch where my shottas cruise, everybody gotta move
Now roger that, hah, roger that
Come front and Imma show you where that choppa at
Already told you my closet is where the prada at
Try an come get me 650 don't know how to act
