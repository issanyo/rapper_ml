[Intro]
Time changed, check out your mind frame
Got no times for mind games (grow up, nigga)
Grow up, nigga

[Verse 1]
He 37, think he 22
His mother work, he play the crib, just polishin' his .22
Plus he eat up all the food but never grocery shop
Actin' like he out lookin' for a job but he know he not
He know the gossip, know what happen when Chad got locked up
He know who beefin' like every weekend, his BM pop up
He keep makin' promises, he gon' help her
He never felt a hard time dealin' with pressure
The youngin' niggas used to respect him, was kinda credible
He shot a couple cats in the 90's, few niggas never knew
He did a stretch for some domestic shit
He punched his ex after she told him, this some pussy you could never get
Behind the wall, turned Blood, but came home neutral
'Cause streets spooky, you think we practise our own voodoo
He realize shit changed, he had to hustle smarter
High temper, shape-up push back, he wanna cut his barber
He loved his father but through his life he could not trust him
Damn near 40, just realized he ain't got nothin'
Had the green light for years, his connect hit the stop button
Back to nicklin', dimin', youngin's on the block pumpin'

[Chorus]
I got homies comin' home sayin' they need a gram
Remembers fiends on my phone sayin' they need a gram
Stuck in the past, guess somebody told him he the man
Some niggas'll never grow up, I call 'em Peter Pan
I got homies comin' home sayin' they need a gram
Remembers fiends on my phone sayin' they need a gram
Stuck in the past, guess somebody told him he the man
Some niggas'll never grow up, I call 'em Peter Pan

[Verse 2]
Niggas bought him clothes when he got out the yard
He was bigger then, homies told him he should bodyguard
He was used to crack's, ain't know the price that molly cost
Youngin's don't pay him no mind, they figure he probably lost
They don't know he grew up in the era where nobody soft
He tried to school 'em and gave 'em his own narcotic talk
Told him never stash your money and your work together
Never had no package when your body, it ain't work forever
Found a nigga you could really trust, I think y'all work together
Never smoke, ridin' with dope, rain is the perfect weather
So how you broke if you got all the answers?
You ain't even got hoes workin' and know all the dancers
Check this out, old head, we gon' get it the way we know how
We ain't takin' deals, I coppin' out, know we gon' blow trial
You slow bringin' it back so we just front you a whole now
Us young niggas get real money, I hope you know now
Everybody that he hang out would be half his age
All he do is argue, been a minute since he had a fade
He got a mattress, he ain't even got no sheets
Been in his mother crib for years and he ain't even got no key

[Chorus]
I got homies comin' home sayin' they need a gram
Remembers fiends on my phone sayin' they need a gram
Stuck in the past, guess somebody told him he the man
Some niggas'll never grow up, I call 'em Peter Pan
I got homies comin' home sayin' they need a gram
Remembers fiends on my phone sayin' they need a gram
Stuck in the past, guess somebody told him he the man
Some niggas'll never grow up, I call 'em Peter Pan

[Verse 3]
How you 40 and niggas pay you to look out?
He don't miss a night at the club, don't miss a cook out (not one)
Dishes in his mother crib, dirty garbage he ain't took out (never)
But he could tell you who got pregnant, tell you who shook out
He holla at the younger girls like he still got it
He never had it, had light static, he still hottin'
Youngin's got him sippin' lean, they got him pill poppin' (percs)
This real knowledge, these niggas 40 and still plottin' (watch 'em)

[Chorus]
I got homies comin' home sayin' they need a gram
Remembers fiends on my phone sayin' they need a gram
Stuck in the past, guess somebody told him he the man
Some niggas'll never grow up, I call 'em Peter Pan
I got homies comin' home sayin' they need a gram
Remembers fiends on my phone sayin' they need a gram
Stuck in the past, guess somebody told him he the man
Some niggas'll never grow up, I call 'em Peter Pan

[Outro]
I blame it on the elder niggas that never helped us
We had to go get it, no guidance, nobody felt us
16 with more pocket money than your daddy
We was broke and we came up from nothin', nigga, we gon' brag
All this Gucci, we gon' brag
Older niggas hatin', not all of 'em I remember callin' 'em, now they so mad
They ain't reach their potential and live the life they want to live

[Chorus]
I got homies comin' home sayin' they need a gram
Remembers fiends on my phone sayin' they need a gram
Stuck in the past, guess somebody told him he the man
Some niggas'll never grow up, I call 'em Peter Pan
I got homies comin' home sayin' they need a gram
Remembers fiends on my phone sayin' they need a gram
Stuck in the past, guess somebody told him he the man
Some niggas'll never grow up, I call 'em Peter Pan
