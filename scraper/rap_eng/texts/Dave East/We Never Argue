[Intro]
We never argue
We never argue
My lil' rider
Uh

[Chorus]
We never argue, I be in motion, soon as I'm free, I'ma call you
When I was broke I couldn’t get next to you
Now it’s a dub for the walk through
That’s twenty thousand
She say I’m childish
I got the Range with no mileage
They think I got me a stylist
We walk up in Gucci we wildin'

[Verse 1]
I’m tryna fuck on an island
I’m tryna match up our diamonds
She see me on TV, she smiling
We always on FaceTime, we bonding
I just want her in Chanel fits
I told her come out on the road with me
Don’t be believing them pictures, she told me I always got too many hoes with me
If you wanna put on my chain, you might as well come out and stand in the cold with me
Hittas every where I go, when I’m in Miami, know I got them Zoes with me
Gabe got me with a froze pinkie, all she wanna smoke is big dope
Remember ridin' on a 10 speed, now I’m in a condo with 10 hoes
I told my mama, "Let her rent go," the fuck you think I’m going in for
I’m in these streets with these other hoes, you was mine trust I would've been home
I just want you feelin' comfortable, all these other niggas wanted you
I see that ass from infront of you, you talkin' bitches I be done for you

[Chorus]
We never argue, I be in motion, soon as I'm free, I'ma call you
When I was broke I couldn’t get next to you
Now it’s a dub for the walk through
That’s twenty thousand
She say I’m childish
I got the Rov' with no mileage
They think I got me a stylist
We walk up in Gucci we wildin'
We never argue, I be in motion, soon as I'm free, I'ma call you
When I was broke I couldn’t get next to you
Now it’s a dub for the walk through
That’s twenty thousand
She say I’m childish
I got that foreign no mileage
They think I got me a stylist
We walk up in Louis we wildin'

[Verse 2]
I done did bad, know I got a past, I think I was living too fast, boo
I know you mad, the money came fast, they staring at me when I pass through
I got a bag and you got a bag, you get me right out of a bad mood
You do anything that I ask you, just wanna know if I could have you
I'm not a nigga that’s gon' harass you
You smell the kush on me soon as I pass you
Like it rough, I can tell when I grab you
Bentley truck with a blunt and I’m gassin'
So bad, she don’t have to speak
It ain’t fashion week but she killin' her fit
Get up in it, I be killin' the shit
Got me thinkin' how I’m livin' and shit
Got me thinkin' why I deal with these chicks
She the type I want some memories with
Everyday I'm watching Benjamins flip
Something 'bout her make my energy switch
Living life that my enemies wish
We 'bout to link up, make this interview quick
On my body, but we still in the whip
I'm in a rush, I got millions to get
Smoke a blunt, call my loc up, like, "Cuz, you think she could deal with kids?"
He said, "Yo cuz, really feelin' this chick"
Fuck all that, I’m bout to chill with my bitch
I'm in the studio, she in the covers
She cook me a dinner, I bought me some rubbers
Probably record 'till like 5 in the morning
I come home and eat it like I ain’t had nothin'
I ain’t had nothin' that had me like this
She look me right in my eyes when we kiss
Listening to Biggie, just me and my bitch
I’m 'bout to get busy, I’m back on my shit
I ain’t had nothing that had me like this
Bend it over, have her runnin' and shit
Listening to Biggie just me and my bitch
I’m bout to get busy, I’m back on my shit

[Chorus]
We never argue
I be in motion, soon as I'm free, I'ma call you
When I was broke I couldn’t get next to you
Now it’s a dub for the walk through
That’s twenty thousand
She say I’m childish
I got the Rov' with no mileage
They think I got me a stylist
We walk up in Gucci we wildin'
We never argue
I be in motion, soon as I'm free, I'ma call you
When I was broke I couldn’t get next to you
Now it’s a dub for the walk through
That’s twenty thousand
She say I’m childish
I got that foreign no mileage
They think I got me a stylist
We walk up in Louis we wildin'
