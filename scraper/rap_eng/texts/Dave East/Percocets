[Intro]
Still on it, still on it, still on it
Prize what up
Gang nigga, gang nigga

[Verse 1]
50,000 cash, you ain't never seen it
I'm  gon' make it happen if I ever dreamed it
My homies on go for whatever reason
I just fucked her once, she told me ain't never leavin'
My Buchanan's scramblin' when it's leather season
I just do this for the money, ain't no better reason
All my niggas ridin' if I ever need 'em
We duckin' feds and tuckin' lead to give your head a season
I just signed a deal that changed my fuckin' life
She just seen me once, I prolly fuck tonight
Even though I say my prayers I grip that rubber tight
Slow emotion, purple potion, double cup of ice
We be on some go and get that bag
Catch a body, never brag
Floatin' cocky in that Jag
Damn right I'm in my bag
These niggas liked me on my last
Most likely cause they trash
You ain't seen this amount of cash
I be in and out of Sacks 5th
Them samples used to make them smokers backflip
I ain't got all the answers, so don't ask shit
This is for the times we had nothin' but tried to act rich
Empty stomach savage just tryna pump a package
Across the border it be raw but don't really fuck with the taxes
I come from a different bracket, break it down by the fraction
Halves, wholes, and quarters, bathrooms and water
Tom Ford on the frames, my youngin's move how I taught 'em
Nigga got low for years, they killed 'em soon as they caught him
Wanted these all my life but didn't care soon as I bought 'em
Bitches, we smut 'em up, let my camera nigga record 'em
Ain't nothin' worse than boredom
From South Central to Fordham

[Hook]
(Pill poppin')
Ski mask in my trunk, they think I'm still robbin'
Hustlin' is my 9 to 5
Got the work it's time to ride
Blunt smokin'
Got up off my ass, I did enough hopin'
Gang signs and liquor, we be gun totin'
I grew up around killers
If you can't swim then you gon' drown nigga
You come up missin', they done found niggas
We come from the ground nigga
No green weed, sip brown liquor
They fuck with me because I sound realer
(Pill poppin')

[Verse 2]
Feel it in the air like I'm Phil Collins
Niggas thought I lost it but I still got it
I got homies still robbin', still plottin'
Still hittin' corners with the wheels rockin'
When you gettin' money you got real options
Me and (?) slide into the tropics with some model broads
I ain't have a dollar so I gotta ball
Faded and I'm feelin' X rated, she good with the head like Tylenol
I'm noddin' off
I don't do the rap beef, they cotton soft
Goin' back and forth for what?
We got cameras in the truck
We got accounts to open up
My old head told me "focus up"
Get your money, stack it, move carefully
Cause niggas hate it when you start gettin' paper like athletes
Break it down with my faculty
Breathe of fresh air, no guessin', that's a factory
112th of Lennox, BB Rolls rollin' Grabba leaf
Couple niggas mad at me
I created a masterpiece
I was in the trenches on benches, them niggas laughed at me
Now I'm in the back of them Benzes, purchase relaxin' me
They told me I be dead or in prison nigga but actually
I'm in the valley rollin' up ballie while bitches ask for me
Family with the plug, don't believe in a nigga taxin' me

[Hook]
(Pill poppin')
Ski mask in my trunk, they think I'm still robbin'
Hustlin' is my 9 to 5
Got the work it's time to ride
Blunt smokin'
Got up off my ass, I did enough hopin'
Gang signs and liquor, we be gun totin'
I grew up around killers
If you can't swim then you gon' drown nigga
You come up missin', they done found niggas
We come from the ground nigga
No green weed, sip brown liquor
They fuck with me because I sound realer
(Pill poppin')

[Outro]
Pill poppin', pill poppin', pill poppin'
Pill poppin', pill poppin', pill poppin'
Pill poppin', pill poppin', pill poppin'
Pill poppin', pill poppin', pill poppin'
Bitch I'm still pill poppin'
