[Intro: Desiigner & Dave East]
This what they all been waitin' for
I guess so
They been waitin' for this shit for a long time didn’t they
I'ma give it everythin' I got
Ayo Dougie park that X6 around the corner
New York City, Harlem
Ayy I'm just feelin' my vibe right now
I'm feelin' myself

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Do the rarri or the phantom, now these bitches call me handsome
Got no time for no romancing, hit it from the back on camera
Bend it over let me see it, 100 thousand I can see it
In public housing with some crack on me
Lawyer money I can beat it
Cuzzo homie he just beat a body
Got it on me, meet me in the lobby
If you broke, then I don't need you round me
Bitches talkin that they need to find me
Sweatsuit, jet black Armani
You can find me anywhere that money at
Realest nigga when it come to this
I already did it, I'm done with that
Balenciaga's all on the couch, prolly why I'm all up in her mouth
We had the guns all up in the couch
We had the drugs all up in the house
I had to trap from like 3 to 8
Then I go rap from like 8 to 3
We put in work like a 9 to 5
We hustle, you know that's the way it be
The way I can hide I'ma say it's me
I'm takin' that charge, I'ma say it's me
Ain't got no paperwork on my name, can't say the same for your homies
I can't say the same for your OG
Jordan's on me, and they OG
Ounce of kush you know it's OG
Beat the pussy up like cold cheeks

[Verse 2: Desiigner]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and shit, sippin' Fanta

Wake up Versace shit, life Desiigner

They be askin' 'round town who be clappin' shit

Pop a Perc, I can't stand up
Gorilla, they come and kill you with bananas
Four fillas, they finna pull up in the Phantom

Go Oscar for Grammy, bitch pull up ya panty
Fill up I'ma flip it, I got bitches pull up and they get it

Say you make you a lot of new money

And all of my niggas gon' split it
