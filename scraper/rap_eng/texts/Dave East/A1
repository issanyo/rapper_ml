East side

Verse 1 :
Life is a bitch and then you gotta die
Killing these niggas …ain’t gotta try
The truth is set you free so I ain’t gotta lie
We from the bottom, can't divide us, that’s the bottom line
I wasn’t the kid that teachers like
Holly with the church ain’t live the preachers life
I have my eyes on the preacher wife
Devil got my conscience how the fuck I’m ‘pose to sleep at night?
I remember nights I wasn’t eating right
Smoking so much sorrow I wasn’t breathing right
These was just bookers never will read as right
Late night we’re hookers bunching my hit in time
Spending weeks in the trap, thinking I need a life
You wanna ride pick a side but on this side this shit is life
Talking and still just pop me a half of a pill
My nigga I’m own it
Talking to God, forgive me for all the sins, I hope that I wake up in the morning

I’mma hustle ’til my day come
Hustle in quite try to my case done
Standing on the couch and popping bottles ’til the case done
Tell me what you need I got that work and bitch is A1
Foreing car A1, codeine A1
Cush smoke A1, wiping code A1
Stressing out A1, back it up A1
Bringing back A1, my hood’s working got good work

My lifephone on your timeline, that GEMINI on your playlist
My bicthes soke at they own money
All your bitches it’s basic
Nineteen I had to pay rent I was outside you stayed in
Half on my niggas it’s catch in and the other half will stay friends
With this new world named A1 drop that when they taste this
One fine but we ain’t kicks, let me hold this out of great eight six
Smoking out all this bank account
That A1 make ’em take it out
Fucked up you eat it out I got hit, you was making out, disgusting
You want a verse with your budget
I cover first with a busting
I ain’t hard to find I’m in public
Had all the diamonds when I was clicking
Up in the studio dogging, I was dog double of my mission
No growd it I smoke nuggets
No pirax in that kitchen, just baggies and I digging scales
Apologize to my mama, both of her sons been in jail
We couldn’t avoid that bullshit
On that chain we took that right back on these cold streets
Walk in if I won’t push back, still high and piegual, we book that
Aarh

I’mma hustle ’til my day come
Hustle in a while in quite try to my case done
Standing on the couch and popping bottles ’til the case done
Tell me what you need I got that work and bitch is A1
Foreing car A1, codeine A1
Cush smoke A1, wiping code A1
Stressing out A1, back it up A1
Bringing back A1, my hood’s working got good work

We’re all mad, we all had the same chance to blow
What you’ll call at they call back but my phone is broke
Change my number, got gunners, don’t run up get smoke
When that keep come, my day one got A1 for sure

We’re all mad, we all had the same chance to blow
What you’ll call at they call back but my phone is broke
Change my number, got gunners, don’t run up get smoke
When that keep come, my day one got A1 for sure

I’mma hustle ’til my day come
Hustle in quite try to my case done
Standing on the couch and popping bottles ’til the case done
Tell me what you need I got that work and bitch is A1
Foreing car A1, codeine A1
Cush smoke A1, wiping code A1
Stressing out A1, back it up A1
Bringing back A1, my hood’s working got good working
My hood’s working got good working
My hood’s working got good working
My hood’s working got good working
A1 nigga, A1 nigga, peace
