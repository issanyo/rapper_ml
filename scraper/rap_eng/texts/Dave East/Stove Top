[Intro]
Yo free my nigga man
Yo free my nigga man
Yo free my nigga man
Man fuck you nigga, get away from us nigga
Man fuck you nigga, get away from us nigga
Man fuck you nigga, get away from us nigga
I said fuck you nigga
I said fuck you nigga
I said fuck you nigga (Lighter!)

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I was in the trap all night
All day tryna get my money back 'fore the sun drop
I'm paranoid so my gun cocked
Bout to run my city but I started off on one block
Flex'll drop a bomb to this shit, we be in the projects every other day boy
I do the mission with the bunnies, I'm a playboy
Don't even ask me what I make boy
I got my mask on in the kitchen
Caught a cramp in my wrist from the whippin'
He actin' nervous around the game, bet he snitchin'
If he don't end up in the dirty with the fishes
Cocaine cookin' on the stove top
But you can smell it through the whole house
Streets got my heart cold like an old house
Sky dweller Rollie with a gold mouth
Couple bottles of that gold shit
A bunch of felons who I roll with
Spent they whole life tryna get a whole brick
I got a cousin doin' life, he never told shit
In a minute boy, your life could change so quick
Let off a whole clip, gave your bitch the whole dick
Nas told me in the dresser where the Tec go
Same energy as Pac when he got with Death Row
Let's go

[Hook]
Cocaine cooking on the stove top
But you can smell it through the whole house
Say my name, I bring the hoes out
I put 20,000 in an old couch

Cocaine cooking on the stove top
But you can smell it through the whole house
Say my name, I bring the hoes out
I put 20,000 in an old couch

Niggas only hate you when they broke
Show me how much money you can make
Rob a bank before the day I go broke
Let's see how much money we could take

Niggas only hate you when they broke
Show me how much money you can make
Rob a bank before the day I go broke
Let's see how much money we could take

[Verse 2: Dave East]
We've been trappin' for a long time
Throw a ladder on the chrome nine
How they killers but they online?
Spot jumpers switch the phone line
Harlem niggas got they own grind, I want the money
Hard to breathe when the yolo cookin' in the spot
Forgot I had a warrant from the bookers to the block
Came up from the bottom, I done took it to the top
Now I do the Rollie, got 'em lookin' at my watch
Trap help me with the lawyer money, I was burnt out
Knew a good girl, hit the dutch, she was turnt out
That new wave, I'm like Max with his perm out
15 I played the lookout, I can earn now
I know a couple fiends that I gave credit
All I want is straight cash, I don't take debit
Rest in peace to Bush, that's the old head
I told him I'd rather be dead than have no bread

[Hook]
Cocaine cooking on the stove top
But you can smell it through the whole house
Say my name, I bring the hoes out
I put 20,000 in an old couch

Cocaine cooking on the stove top
But you can smell it through the whole house
Say my name, I bring the hoes out
I put 20,000 in an old couch

Niggas only hate you when they broke
Show me how much money you can make
Rob a bank before the day I go broke
Let's see how much money we could take

Niggas only hate you when they broke
Show me how much money you can make
Rob a bank before the day I go broke
Let's see how much money we could take

[Outro]
Take it out your pocket if you got it
I used to have to hide the product in the closet
Take it out your pocket if you got it
I used to have to hide the product in the closet
Take it out your pocket if you got it
I used to have to hide the product in the closet
Take it out your pocket if you got it
I used to have to hide the product in the closet
