[Verse 1]
Last night I knew what i saw babe
Last night I knew what i wanted
Last night I was down for anything
Last night I had my mind on straight

I see the way that your looking at me
I feel like I wanna drive you crazy
You see that I’m looking at you maybe
You feel like you can get anything, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I see your insecurities running high
Like glimpses of dull stars in the moonlight
I see your adrenaline running high
Thinking that your gonna swoop me up tonight

Don’t expect nothing, I don't owe you nothing
I see you bluffing, drinks got you all gushing
I see your adrenaline running high
Thinking that your gonna swoop me up tonight

[Chorus]
We’re bumping, grinding, you want some unwinding
I keep you chasing, got no interest in you baby
You expecting something?
Well gone get led on tonight, be alone all night

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Real shit, I’m in the Diamond district with a bitch that I never met, (on god)
I ain’t trickin on her I cop myself some new shit but I bet she get very wet (splash)
Christian louboutin my every step (red), I fuck her all night we don’t ever rest (all night)
I take her advice cause the head the best, if she missed the flight bet she catch the next

I introduced her to etiquette, nuggets and fries she was eatin when I met the bitch
Niggas be hating on instagram, see them in public they run down like they never said the shit
My first still got me a rover, I just went got me a Maybach so I can get head in it
Powder in side one, on god we would measure it, I do not trust her Glock, nine in the bed with it

Under my pillow she don’t know, she insecure but I ain’t stressing that (at all)
Said I got her mind on a chock hold, I think about her counting every stack (every rack)
I only go where the bros go, she told me I wish that you never rapped
She in love with the drama I deaded that, wanna argue lets go to the bed with that

[Pre-Chorus]
I see your insecurities running high
Like glimpses of dull stars in the moonlight
I see your adrenaline running high
Thinking that your gonna swoop me up tonight

Don’t expect nothing, I don't owe you nothing
I see you bluffing, drinks got you all gushing
I see your adrenaline running high
Thinking that your gonna swoop me up tonight

[Chorus]
We’re bumping, grinding, you want some unwinding
I flipped the role on you and I ain’t even trying
It's easy watch me, put you in your place
All alone in your space, displaced
