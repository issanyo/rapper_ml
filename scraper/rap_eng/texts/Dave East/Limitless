[Intro]
Y'all ready for the rest of the show? Everybody say yeah
I say you ready for the rest of the show? Everybody say yeah
Are you ready? So right now stand up on your feet
Stand up motherfuckers, stand up
Because coming to the stage, he needs no introduction

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Big meals at Frankie & Johnny's, I tip generous
Ain't no ceilings for DZA, my shit limitless
Out of body experience
Wait, jump back in my temple, I got a vision, is this killer shit?
Whole lotta commas is what you dealing with, the main event
Don't even mention them other cats to me, they came and went
Lost case, competition locked in a cross face
Grip tight, pissed like Tony when he lost on a horse race
Travel abroad safe, the Lord's great
Righteous, been blessed since diapers
For the lookers' and the likers'
The boy dead Syria, nigga, watch how they ISIS
The nicest, underrated, overrated, fuck the ratings
Who debate? Then screw your opinions, see what the people saying
God gotta watch for Satan, I operate in silence
Keep the peace, but niggas only respect violence
Hammer play, Greg Valentinein' and I'm shining, I earned this
O's burning, most sermons continue steaming
I planned this back since ridin' filthy on a Major Deegan
You gotta kill 'em and leave 'em breathing sometimes
Give 'em a tour through stress valley, make sure it's scenic and grime
Gold glasses filled, my wine spilt
How can niggas stand there and downplay all that shit that I built?
Fuck it, everything is signed, sealed, I'm just reflectin'
I leave the credit for the bill collectors, DZA

[Hook: Dave East]
It ain't no limit to this life I'm living
Champagne spilling, bunch of topless women
I wake up like I just got to get it
I'm limitless, never find something real as this
Ain't no limit to this life I'm living
Champagne spilling, bunch of topless women
I wake up like I just got to get it
I'm limitless, never find something real as this

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
I'm in the pole, 29,000 feet from concrete
Chief chief like my big uncle from Long Beach
Bumping Commodores
Running through the pack like Marshall Faulk
Like a boss, I cop 10 like Masha'Allah
George Kush 'bout to twist the martial law
You don't even run your own life, what you talking for?
God damn, lil homie up north kept shooting, hot hand
Here come the police, I'm seeing red lights, Roxanne
Big drum thumping like a rock band, woah
Watch a nigga paint the picture, young Vince Van Gogh
Highlight reel, highlight show
5 Mic flow, gotta see further than your eyesight go
I call the iso, young big homie, you got it right though
Last of the poets, gotta fight the good fight, bro
Kush god, I like dough, the idol
Lobster and rock obscure Lo
Y'all know
Switch to some custom shit and change the pace
Presidential crowns with the shiny face

[Hook: Dave East]
There ain't no limit to this life I'm living
Champagne spilling, bunch of topless women
I wake up like I just got to get it
I'm limitless, never find something real as this
There ain't no limit to this life I'm living
Champagne spilling, bunch of topless women
I wake up like I just got to get it
I'm limitless, never find something real as this

[Outro]
Don't smoke rock
Don't smoke rock
Uh, yeah, come on, hahaha, that's right
