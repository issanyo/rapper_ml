[Intro]
MORTEN, we got one

[Chorus]
Head crackin' had your summer, uh
Put that money in your pocket, uh
Put that money in your pocket, uh
Put that money in your pocket, uh
Put that money in your pocket, uh

[Verse 1]
Been in the field for a long time
Hunnid bitches on my phone line (hunnid)
I be all up in that Gucci shit
The flyest nigga in my own mind (fly)
I been lookin' for a whole thing
I'm 2Pac without the nose ring (I'm 'Pac)
I'm B.I.G. if he was skinny, nigga (uh)
Backwoods smokin', Henny sipper
I done went to war with plenty niggas
I done hit you bitch a hunnid times (hunnid)
Ask my jeweler, blew a hunnid thou'
I told myself that I was done with Crime (done)
I was livin' out my mother house
Tryna bag me up a hunnid dimes (a hunnid)
Court visits paid a hunnid fines
Told the fiends ain't no cuttin' line (stay there)
Early mornin' in the lobby wit' it (uh)
Or late night, I'm in the park sellin'
Do my dirt all by myself, I never know the shit that y'all tellin'
In a Sprinter van with all felons, pray to God that they don't pull us over
If they do, I got that bail money, but that's the shit my lawyer shoulda told me
I been in and out of innate (in and out)
I been lied to a hunnid times
So I pay attention to my friends' faces (I'm white)
What kinda gas do the Benz take? (uh)
What kinda money make 'em all fuck? (talk)
Only foreign shit I park up
It's a better chance if I walk up
Niggas lose they life over short bucks

[Chorus]
Head crackin' had your summer, uh
Put that money in your pocket
Put that money in your pocket
Put that money in your pocket
Put that money in your pocket

[Verse 2]
A head crackin' had your summer, uh
Put that money in your pocket nigga (talk that)
Everybody tryna get a dollar from me, get yo hand up out my pocket nigga (uh)
A hunnid grand, ain't got no wallet on em' (hunnid)
Straight cash a make ya momma want 'em
Straight credit I can swipe swipe (swipe)
Your favorite rapper ain't got a dollar on 'em (bro)
Depositing in effect, laugh to the bank, laugh in they face
Anybody down then pass me a case
Pop it in they face, cash in the safe
Combination forward only for my momma homie (momma)
I'm in the house with all my diamonds on me (all my diamonds)
Any colder, I'mma catch the flu (*coughing*)
I'm kickin' back like I'm a soccer goalie (kickback)
I paid attention to what the drama show me
Live or die, the only option comin' up from nothin', I'm tryna keep my balance homie (tryin')
Married the streets, just don't get divorced, you prolly end up payin' alimony
How you love the butterfly?
I hate the caterpillar, focused on what matters only (uh)
Family, family
Don't ever go against family (please)
Roll up a blunt full of memories
I treat the foreign like enemies
Every morning it's my energy
I pray I don't drown in this Hennessy (I pray)
Geto Boy, I feel like Willie D (Geto Boy)
Remember when they never mention me (never)
Just know it's greatness that you're witnessing

[Bridge]
Hunnid grand, ain't got no wallet on 'em
Straight cash a make ya momma want 'em
Straight credit, I can swipe swipe (uh)
Hunnid grand, ain't got no wallet on 'em
Straight cash make ya' momma want 'em
Straight credit, I can swipe, I can swipe

[Outro]
