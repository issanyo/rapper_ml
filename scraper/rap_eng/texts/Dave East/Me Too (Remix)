[Verse 1: Dave East]
Them bottles black like Wesley
Louis trunks on a jet ski
Hit Vegas feelin' like Peshay
How they tellin' me I'm actin' different
I was like this when they met me
I won't back down, you gotta check me
That girl scout got me stress free
White leather seats in that peach 5
I played the records since Keef slide
They not hustlers, y'all need y'all
My Muslim niggas only fear Allah
And they ain't holdin' no bean pies
Hopped out of that king ride
Heart cooler than a fiend's eye
Nigga, I need mines
I need cake all in my jeans
Steak on my plate
Cuban all up on my neck
Lawyer pay for my case
Backwood on my dope
Champagne for the hoes
Designer all on my clothes
Hammer on my waist

[Verse 2: LoVel]
So tonight, I'mma need you
You, a couple friends and me too
Double cup with the Hennessy do
Take another hit, let it free you
I could see you
Been working hard, girl, me too
Take the night off for you and me too
Girl, you and me

[Pre-Chorus: LoVel]
I am not perfect, but damn, you are
Closer than I've ever seen before
From your lips to your hips, girl, you're beautiful
And you know that be fronting, girl, you way lost
I, I know you love
I see it in your eyes
Just take a chance once in your life
Oh, I know what's on your mind
Say you only want one night, well me too

[Chorus: LoVel]
Are you drunk? Well, me too
You high enough there, me too
I'm tryna cop that, me too
You wanna friend that, me too
Girl, are you drunk? Well, me too
Take a couple shots, shit, me too
Light 'em up now, me too
Grab a couple friends and me too

[Verse 3: LoVel]
Show me some things
Girl, are you taken? I don't see your ring
Girl, why you faking, I know why you came
All this relationship shit is the same
But for the night, I need you
Stay the night, please do
You say you only want one night
Girl, me too

[Pre-Chorus: LoVel]
I am not perfect, but damn, you are
Closer than I've ever seen before
From your lips to your hips, girl, you're beautiful
And you know that be fronting, girl, you way lost
I, I know you love
I see it in your eyes
Just take a chance once in your life
Oh, I know what's on your mind
Say you only want one night, well me too

[Chorus: LoVel]
Are you drunk? Well, me too
You high enough there, me too
I'm tryna cop that, me too
You wanna friend that, me too
Girl, are you drunk? Well, me too
Take a couple shots, shit, me too
Light 'em up now, me too
Grab a couple friends and me too
