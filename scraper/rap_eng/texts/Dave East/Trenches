[Intro]
108th street
119th street
117th street nigga
We grindin'

[hook]
I was in the trenches praying to God I could make it
I've been trying to get it, bitch, I'm running out of patience
Shooter on the roof, I don't pass, bitch, I'm facin' (shooter)
Watch the cops, gamblin' on the block, like it's Vegas
I was in the trenches praying to God I could make it (praying)
I've been trying to get it bitch, I'm running out of patience
Shooter on the roof, I don't pass, bitch, I'm facin' (headshot)
Watch the cops, gamblin' on the block, like it's Vegas

[Verse 1]
Hate Me Now dropped, now I loud shop, you already know I'm with the dumb shit
My bitch bad and my blunt lit, got everything I need I don't want shit
I'm on 108th, I'm on 110th, your bitch pulled down my zipper and tongue-kissed
I got hitters on call, they don't want shit
I got millions on the call to hear son spit
Niggas go broke over one chick
Sold all the dimes, I got one nick'
You can get rich off of one flip
Hollowheads in the Ruger make you front flip
I don't crew-hop, I got one clique
I won't give a dollar up to one bitch
Seat back, blunt lit, knocking Pun shit
I'm in great shape baby, I can run shit
Let's go

[Hook]
I was in the trenches praying to God I could make it
I've been trying to get it, bitch, I'm running out of patience
Shooter on the roof, I don't pass, bitch, I'm facin' (shooter)
Watch the cops, gamblin' on the block, like it's Vegas
I was in the trenches praying to God I could make it (praying)
I've been trying to get it bitch, I'm running out of patience
Shooter on the roof, I don't pass, bitch, I'm facin' (headshot)
Watch the cops, gamblin' on the block, like it's Vegas

[Verse 2]
I ride for the gang, tho
Free my nigga, Drain-O
Gotta watch what you say, tho
Niggas die everyday, bro
I remember nights, no cable (I remember)
Catch a body, gotta lay low (low)
Turn a snapback to a halo
Then I slide with a bitch, look like J-Lo
Money comin they gon move when I say so
Real street nigga, rest in peace Bankroll
Blue hundreds to the Yen to the Pesos
I just hope I make it there before the bank close
Ain't my birthday but I'm getting cake tho (cake)
In the worst way, they be trynna hate bro
All I know is chase cheese, get the queso
Now we sipping Dom P by the case load
Let's go

[Hook]
I was in the trenches praying to God I could make it
I've been trying to get it, bitch, I'm running out of patience
Shooter on the roof, I don't pass, bitch, I'm facin' (shooter)
Watch the cops, gamblin' on the block, like it's Vegas
I was in the trenches praying to God I could make it (praying)
I've been trying to get it bitch, I'm running out of patience
Shooter on the roof, I don't pass, bitch, I'm facin' (headshot)
Watch the cops, gamblin' on the block, like it's Vegas

[Outro]

Shooter on the roof, I don't pass, bitch, I'm facin'
Watch the cops, gamblin' on the block, like it's Vegas
