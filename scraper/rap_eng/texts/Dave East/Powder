[Intro]
Lot of money man
Shit don’t stop
Whole lotta money
Never
That’s all it’s about
I’ma go get mine regardless…

[Bridge]
I might put a bed in the Range (Rover), it feel like I live on the road (Out)
I got my daughter to raise (Kairi), so I’m fallin' back on you hoes (fallin’)
I counted up 50 today (50), so I’m a go get me some clothes
You had that powder you put on your feet, we had the powder you sniff in your nose (sniff)

[Chorus]
My niggas live by the code, I listen to rich, I don't listen to broke  (never)
I don't think you fit for the smoke, I laugh at your team, your clique is a joke (ha!)
Roll down the window and shoot, just drop off a bag, I’m a pick up and blow (blow)
Remember my socks was wet, I fucked up half of my kicks in the snow (whoa)
I used to walk to the train, would only complain, to niggas I know (my niggas)
Niggas was cool with me, now I got jewelry, they don't look at me the same (what happened?)
They show me love when they right in my face, but hatin’ never would show (never)
I was taught you wanna see the body drop, you gotta aim at the brain (headshot)

[Verse 1]
Got down on my knees and I prayed (I prayed)
I woke up with keys to the Wraith (Wraith)
I got the keys to the safe (safe)
It’s bustin’ out with them hundreds (blue)
No party, I can’t bring the gun in (nope)
They talk like they hard, they be runnin' (pew)
I got the game right where I want it (right there)
I tatted the gang on my stomach (east side)

[Bridge]
I might put a bed in the Range (Rover), it feel like I live on the road (we out)
I got my daughter to raise (Kairi), so I’m fallin' back on you hoes (fall back)
I counted up 50 today, so I’m a go get me some clothes
You had that powder you put on your chest, we had the powder you sniff in your nose (sniff)

[Chorus]
My niggas live by the code, I listen to rich, I don't listen to broke (at all)
I don't think you fit for the smoke, I laugh at your team, your clique is a joke (I'm laughin!)
Roll down the window and shoot, just drop off a bag, I’m a pick up and blow (blow)
Remember my socks was wet, I fucked up half of my kicks in the snow (whoa)
I used to walk to the train, would only complain to niggas I know (my niggas)
Niggas was cool with me, now I got jewelry, they don't look at me the same (bust down)
They show me love when they right in my face, but hatin' never would show (never)
I was taught you wanna see the body drop, you gotta aim at the brain (boom)

[Bridge]
I might put a bed in the Range (Rover), it feel like I live on the road  (uh!)
I got my daughter to raise (Kairi), so I’m fallin' back on these hoes (fall back)
Counted up 50 today, so I’m a go get me some clothes
You had that powder you put on your feet, We had that powder you sniff in your nose (sniff)

[Verse 2]
My niggas live by a code, not violent you gon' get exposed (exposed)
Freaky ain't get to see 30 years old, I hope I see 30, that hit me the most (the most)
This foreign, just grip with the coast (skrr)
I built me a brand, my business could grow (grow)
If I’m with my daughter, but I need some weed, my lil’ bitch gon' pick up the smoke (pick that up)
Most of my niggas was broke, get it in blood, or get it in coke
Flaggin’ everywhere in these streets, go up north, heard you was crip on the low
I be with niggas that don't be on Instagram, 'cause they livin' the most (most)
I kept a gun, but I couldn't pay rent with the toast, my livin' was gross (ew)
Bunch of roaches in my bedroom, I’m glad the phantom got leg room (uh)
Don't worry bout it, he be dead soon (soon)
The hatred come, 'cause I'm a threat to em’ (I know)
I used to get on the bus, go roll up a blunt, with niggas I trusted (my niggas)
My uncle was fuckin' with leak, can’t listen to him, 'cause that nigga was dusted (dust)
I value all of my jewelry, you get a funeral, you try to touch it (boom)
I hated the food up in jail, it twisted my stomach, that shit was disgustin' (ew)
We throwin' hollows, no punchin’, in the trap, I ain't have to go punch-in (nah)
We would go hustle so eagerly, watch what I say, 'cause my daughter repeatin’ me (uh)
Now top execs wanna meet with me (uh)
The ones I dream about, come sleep with me (come here)
Still only the gang, can eat with me
I think about Mugga, he needed me
Now top execs wanna meet with me (uh)
The ones I dream about, come sleep with me (facts)
Still only the gang, can eat with me (facts)
I think about Freaky, he needed me
