[Intro: Dave East & Styles P]
P, what up?
Chillin', East

[Chorus: Dave East & Styles P]
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
Play the hood with a diva, might want her but I don't need her
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
Quarterback the work, you shorty is a receiver
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
There's enough to go around as long as you hold it down (more than enough)
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf (It's where we at)
Tomorrow do an island, tonight we do the town (tag)

[Verse 1: Dave East & Styles P]
Uh, your skin tone look like Egyptian sand
She like fast cars, hit Nassau to go get a tan
Never discriminate, your race, I don't think about
Black and brown is beautiful and white girls is thicker now, I keep me one
The homie down soon as I get in town
Told her lay her seat back, baby, I run my city now
I ain't your average, you be lucky if you get a chance
She on CÃŽROC, after I hit it do the Diddy dance
On the balcony of the Waldorf
She knows that I'm into art but never had a Warhol
But used to sling in the war hall
Ramo from Beatstreet, piece in my long hall (hahaha)
She knows the real thing from a cornball
She gon' keep the things wrapped up on a long haul
Fuck around and fuck her all night to a long song
Secret Garden on repeat, we gon' get our porn on

[Chorus: Dave East & Styles P]
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
Play the hood with a diva, might want her but I don't need her
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
Quarterback the work, you shorty is a receiver
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
There's enough to go around as long as you hold it down
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
Tomorrow do an island, tonight we do the town (tag)

[Verse 2: Styles P & Dave East]
You can have my money and my Amex (you can have it)
If I had a nine to five, you could get my paycheck
We could fuck in a safe, call that shit safe sex
Lay out with the TEC then, call that shit latex
You could have a Master Card, a Visa, get a passport in Ibiza
But you gotta hold the shit we got sittin' in the freezer (hold that)
And you gotta hold this ratchet that my man got
Shit got a body in, you don't want your man hot
Yo, I never seen her in my life, I scooped her on my man block
Strapped with her a package after I fucked at the gram spot
Coke all in the backroom, baggies in the cabinets
She know I'm a rapper but ain't meet me on no rapper shit
I don't do the pills, but she gotta be how ecstasy feel
We ride out to Donny Hathaway or Stephanie Mills
Attractin' a vial, shorty so relaxed on the job
She never nervous make a bust with product strapped to her thigh

[Chorus: Dave East & Styles P]
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
Play the hood with a diva, might want her but I don't need her
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
Quarterback the work, you shorty is a receiver
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
There's enough to go around as long as you hold it down
Thots we at the Ramada, models we at the Waldorf
Tomorrow do an island, tonight we do the town (tag)
