[Intro]
Take a nigga like me
Came from nothin', turned it into everything
A hundred thousand worth of jewellery on

[Verse 1]
Look at me, your bitch all in my car
Snakes all up in my car (snakes)
No more brown, we gon' hit the bar, I got 50 cars (yikes!)
He the shit, and his pieces hit, pick out any mall
You a worker, you need permission 'fore you meet with any boss
Get found, I run the town, I should move into City Hall (run it)
You screamin' free the homies, but never pick up their call (nah)
Biggie Small, I'm killin', ain't even give 'em my all
I just pop two and a half, feel like the ceiling gon' fall
Them foreigns, I can't explain 'em, you are now witnessin' greatness
They think I'm Illuminati, all my Margeilas is Masons
This .40 move your body, I put you on a vacation
I ain't talkin' oversees, I don't wanna go to court (nah)
I don't want no bitches in my section, if they not fucking
You be in the Louis store takin' pictures, won't cop nothin'
Only feel lonely, runnin' if they see cops comin'
My youngen, in the back of the car, he ready to rock somethin'

[Chorus]
Times is gettin' harder
Body getting cold (cold)
Smiling through the drama
Drown me and it's over
I be smokin' dope, 'cause I ain't dyin' sober
If it ain't about a dollar, they know I ain't going
Times is getting harder
Body getting cold (cold)
Smiling through the drama
Drown me and it's over
I be smokin' dope, 'cause I ain't dyin' sober
If it ain't about a dollar, they know I ain't going

[Verse 2]
...with them niggas, I got them Dimes and them twenties
I go to sleep with my pistol, subliminal's don't up feel me
I pour F&N simply, it got me movin' slow motion
Pop a perc and I'm coastin', on Harlem trip, bitch I'm rollin'
It probably smell like we smokin', before that zip even open
On top of it I was boastin', smokin', just baggin' them boulders
We could all get this money, don't really matter who older
Young niggas stash by the stroller, we in packagin' Copa

[Bridge]
These niggas averaging boulders
Kill 'em to having a motive
Moncler jacket is polar, ice clear drippin' like water
Now when you see that 8 ball, you think of the border
Now every million I count, I think of my daughter

[Verse 3]
Transporter my man, on a hand to hand
On order, shoot his face, get off with manslaughter
Blue vein caught up, we surveyin' rappin' the ten quarter
You can't call 'em, number unlisted
But pop off, got a few grams for you
It's on the house

[Chorus]
Times is gettin' harder
Body getting cold (cold)
Smiling through the drama
Drown me and it's over
I be smokin' dope, 'cause I ain't dyin' sober
If it ain't about a dollar, they know I ain't going
Times is getting harder
Body getting cold (cold)
Smiling through the drama
Drown me and it's over
I be smokin' dope, 'cause I ain't dyin' sober
If it ain't about a dollar, they know I ain't going
