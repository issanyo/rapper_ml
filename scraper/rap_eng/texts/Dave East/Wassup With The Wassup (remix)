[Dave East]
I was on some broke shit
Bunch of roaches by the mattress
On some loc shit way before I started flaggin
Yeah, I'm from the nine
Talking smoke is automatic
A dime for the pinky
Eighty for the patek
All this double G be on me
Got me fuckin' niggas wife
Came home without a scar
Can give a fuck about 'cha life
Free Meek, shit be weak
Kids can even want a bike
Diamonds get to tone woppin'
When I put 'em in the light
From waking up in my cell
To breaking up, making sales
Fuck ya' promoters
This yola'll break the scale
Fresh off the border, neck look imported
Baptise that powder, it's fresh out the water
Niggas hatin' on me like they getting paid for it
I wake up and get a check
I mastered this, that's why you slave for it
In baltimore county I had like eight warrants
Murders in my name
This ain't Cam, I think this Mase calling
Hello?

[Ray Mula]
I was fuckin all these hoes
Way before I started trappin
Lookin' like a rapper
Way before I started rappin'
Yeah, I'm from the eight
Talk about it, make it happen
We can get it poppin'
We can get it crackin'
All this dsquared on hoes throwin me the box
Niggas asking the price, still ain't never cop
I done violated cops
Give a pass to the opps
Lovin' the Glock
Still copping diamonds over choppas
I'm just harlem world
Aka money making
Hoes start liking, niggas start hating
Try to keep it funky
Niggas started faking
Grip on deck
We can still get it shaking
Throwing perc after perc, that's the repill
Shawty sleepin on the hooka
So we made her pay for the refill
I'm still taking her home
And if she throw me on the snap
Then I'm breakin her phone, come on

[Don Q]
I'll be walking thru the fire when the smoke clear
Tell my niggas open fire, when the cost clear
Yeah that block was on fire but I post there
Don't stand by that car tire we got coke there
Fuck a prince nigga I got king status
Stuff two hunnit thousand in the queen mattress
All my ice bright, nigga I done seen darkness
My lawyer got pistol cases looking like weed charges
I told 'em we them niggas last time I seen Artist
Winter time, Tom Brown Louie V scarf it
I ain't in it for a friendship
Boy I play for keeps
I got a problem, I'm in Harlem
I hit Ray and East
My nigga Mula pull a grip
And that's to say the least
I told him we can make a killin
Boy this game is sweet
You was with us way before the label nigga
I told 'em get a chair and pull up to the table nigga
