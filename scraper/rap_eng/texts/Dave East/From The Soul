[Verse 1: Dave East]
My baby brother 19 but still teaching me
Frustration and anger done made a beast in me
Knocking ready to die, ain't no rest in peace for me
I told my brother anything i got, you got it equally
I'm becoming a man taking it farther
It feel like trynna go get a ceasar without a barber
I'm growing wild , while parents don't even know their child
Dysfunctional feel uncomfortable but you know my style
Back against the ropes like a boxer
Watching Goodfellas my influence was the mobsters
We would get sick with no insurance for a doctors
Hard to get cake but in the hood you get a chopper
Lil niggas barely 15 be catchin Homi'es
I just wanna record could give a fuck if they sign me
My jumper used to be water just like Dasani
Now the bad blocks and gutter where you can find me
Engineers all about money until you make it
Let them know your struggle they see the money and take it
Money over most but paper is never sacred
Unless its in the Bible but most of these niggas is fakin'
I never pumped crack i sold a lot of trees
Tried to get my education but I had to fallback
Notice of eviction familiar black struggle
That's why most of us  in prison try to talk but we don't listen
But fuck what I been through its only making me stronger
Even if its taking me longer I got to win dude
Tell me how I'm suppose to sit in class when the rent due
Teacher got a check and not concerned with what you into
That's why I slept through it
I'm up chasing a dollar pressure I step to it
Know you're official when you do it like a ref do it
I know you feel how I'm feeling this shit is stress music
Pop a X to it sometimes I feel I ain't shit
I guess my eX knew it
Sincerity and being honest is the best music
Catalog shoppers with a patience of a shotter
Whip the color collide us , eyes like the stripe on a Pradas
Taking flight for the product
Couple nights and reminders
You lose your life over dollars we street niggas but scholars
Politicking at diners ,and your killer come with a smiling face
So fuck a sparkler tell a owner to provide a case
I'm from money making so we really ain't no time to waste
Autographing bodies, leave niggas and sign their face
Told [?] my glass is up like I'm celebrating
I'm fortunate to be be the nigga that was never hating
Bob Marley true smoker forever blazing
Imma do this for my niggas that'll never make it
