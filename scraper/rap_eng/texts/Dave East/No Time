[Chorus:]
I ain't got no time to waste
Hundred diamonds in your face
I could pull up in a foreign nigga but I rather do the coupe today
The streets is watching so I keep it by me I got so much money I could make
So much money I could make
So much money I could make

[Verse 1:]
I been in another world got another girl tryna give up everything
I was waiting for work and it never came so I bagged up some dimes hit the 7 train
Back in the mix with my homies
I play the game like I'm Kobe
Spend a few racks for the Rollie
My nigga don't act like you know me
I found a spot we could [?] let's take this shit over I got what they coppin' they love it
Family and paper put nothing above it we buggin' in public they love how we stuntin'
I can get shorty to strip, (take it off) told her just come take a sip photos they taking we look like we rich
Pull up like Ceelo 45 or the 6
I just want guap I want queso want cheddar
Balenciaga no Maison Margiela
I want a Porsche and the seats must be leather
I walk in court smell the kush on my sweater
I never said nothing I kept my mouth shut
You talk like a nigga that never got cut
Hoes came around and you never got butt
Got no time to waste always in a rush
Need more than a hundred

[Chorus:]
I ain't got no time to waste
Hundred diamonds in your face
I could pull up in a foreign nigga but I rather do the coupe today
The streets is watching so I keep it by me I got so much money I could make
So much money I could make
So much money I could make

[Verse 2:]
Need more than a hundred in cash I come with a gun and a mask
I want it so bad in love with this math
Bundles and bundles we dump in the bag
Load up my pistol while running a bath
Running the city like Diddy my nigga
Cut the top off that 650 my nigga
Don't roll it up unless it's sticky my nigga
I got a couple plugs
Told me just call them whenever I need it
I'm back to take over them niggas was greedy
My team wasn't eating was constantly dreaming about Porsches and Bentleys and Benzes
See money fuck up some friendships
I'm cooking the Lord is my witness
I fell asleep in the trap with the biscuits
I ain't concerned if you ain't talking business
Only spare women and children
I went to Boston I heard they had pills and came back to Harlem and I made a killing
All I want is everything
I did shit they never seen
Woke up chasing every dream
Coke connect from [?]
But I met him in out in Queens looking for a fiend

[Chorus:]
I ain't got no time to waste
Hundred diamonds in your face
I could pull up in a foreign nigga but I rather do the coupe today
The streets is watching so I keep it by me I got so much money I could make
So much money I could make
So much money I could make
