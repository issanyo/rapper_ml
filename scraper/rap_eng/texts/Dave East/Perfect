[Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
Oh, we ain't friends no more?
Why you won't listen no more?
Damn, I let a good girl go
Away, away, away, I've been
All around the world
And I've been looking for you, searching
You deserve it 'cause you're perfect (perfect)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
Baby, baby, yeah, you perfect
Gotta compliment your tits (yeah, yeah)
All that ass up, love how you twerk it
Can you do that on the dick? (Oh, can you?)
Don't be shy, no, up and down (nah)
You know what it is (yeah, yeah)
Concentrate, baby, get it, get it (get it)
And bring that ass right here (right here, right here)
Ooh, ooh, I'ma go down, I'ma go down (I'ma go down)
Ooh, ooh, I'm doing freaky shit 'cause ain't nobody 'round (ooh, ooh) (nobody, nobody)
And don't be acting fake when you see me out
You don't wanna hear me out, how you gonna play me out? Why? Why? (Nah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
Oh, we ain't friends no more? (Why?)
Why you won't listen no more? (Listen)
Damn, I let a good girl go
Away, away, away (away)
I've been, all around the world
And I've been looking for you, searching (I've been lookin')
You deserve it 'cause you're perfect

[Verse 1: Dave East]
You deserve it 'cause you perfect (perfect)
You make every moment worth it (every moment)
I'm flyin' down Collins, I'm shirtless (skrrt)
Just thinkin' how you might've curved it (might have curved it)
I knew you a minute, don't act like you don't know the business
I've been tryna get all up in it (been tryin')
Gave you my card, I don't know 'bout no limit (swipe)
They can't see us in it, that foreign was tinted (oh)
Nowadays they get too borin' with niggas
In love with that pussy, adorin' these women (I love 'em)
Bring out some Molly, bet all of them with it
If I take you shoppin', make sure it's expensive (cash up)
Nothin' feel better than knowin' that pussy for me (mine)
I've been a wolf in these streets
I hold my own in it, and ain't nobody took it from me (nobody)
I get women you wouldn't believe
Eye on that money, I'm gon' get high with your honey
Might take a trip out of the country (we gone)
Know I got hoes, she not findin' it funny
Her brain is so good, I can't ride with no dummy (nah)
I only see you in Prada, not bummy (no)
I'm from the streets, but your momma gon' love me
I told her, "I never run out of this money" (nah)
Fall back on your homies, a lot of them love me
It's 'bout to get ugly

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, we ain't friends no more?
Why you won't listen no more?
Damn, I let a good girl go
Away, away, away, I've been
All around the world
And I've been looking for you, searching
You deserve it 'cause you're perfect

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
Baby, baby, yeah, you perfect
Gotta compliment your tits (yeah, yeah)
All that ass up, love how you twerk it
Can you do that on the dick? (Woo!)
Don't be shy, no, up and down
You know what it is (yeah, yeah)
Concentrate, baby, get it, get it
And bring that ass right here
Ooh, ooh, I'ma go down, I'ma go down
Ooh, ooh, I'm doing freaky shit 'cause ain't nobody 'round (ooh, ooh)
And don't be acting fake when you see me out (don't be actin' fake)
You don't wanna hear me out, how you gonna play me out? Why? Why? (Better not, ha)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
Oh, we ain't friends no more? (Tell 'em)
Why you won't listen no more? (Won't listen)
Damn, I let a good girl go
Away, away, away, I've been
All around the world
And I've been looking for you, searching
You deserve it 'cause you're perfect

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Perfect, that might not describe you (it might)
I need a word, that's much better
I'm tryna get back up inside you (oh)
Know they gon' hate on the way that we slide through
I don't know nothin', I know 'bout survival (survival)
Why the hell women only fuck with lames? (Lames)
Used to the trains, ain't been on no planes (nah)
Really thinkin' all these niggas the same
After I hit it, I'm pickin' your brain (come here)
I wanna know what you like
I wanna know if you smoke, am I strokin' tonight? (Oh)
Picture us both gettin' low on a flight
Love is a gamble, I'm rollin' the dice
When you Snapchat, you takin' pictures with my chain on
Club rockin', but I ain't goin' (no)
Your shit get wetter than the rain pourin'
I'm tryna splash (splash)
I'm wonderin' why we not friends? (Not one)
If you ask me, it kind of depends
I done got nasty with lots of her friends
I keep it a hunnid, don't gotta pretend (no)
I be so blunted, I got to go in
I'm here for women, won't acknowledge no men (no)
Was kind of drunk, but shawty got in the Benz (skrrt)
Promise, stick with me, you probably gon' win (ha)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
Oh, we ain't friends no more? (Why?)
Why you won't listen no more? (Tell me that)
Damn, I let a good girl go
Away, away, away, I've been
All around the world
And I've been looking for you, searching (I been lookin')
You deserve it 'cause you're perfect (you deserve it)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
Baby, baby, yeah, you perfect
Gotta compliment your tits (yeah, yeah)
All that ass up, love how you twerk it
Can you do that on the dick? (Ooh)
Don't be shy, no, up and down (don't be shy)
You know what it is (yeah, yeah)
Concentrate, baby, get it, get it
And bring that ass right here (right here, uh)
Ooh, ooh, I'ma go down, I'ma go down (I'ma go down)
Ooh, ooh, I'm doing freaky shit 'cause ain't nobody 'round (ooh, ooh) (nobody)
And don't be acting fake when you see me out (better not)
You don't wanna hear me out, how you gonna play me out? Why? Why? (No, no, nah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
Oh, we ain't friends no more? (Tell me that)
Why you won't listen no more? (Don't listen)
Damn, I let a good girl go (damn)
Away, away, away, I've been (I've been away)
All around the world
And I've been looking for you, searching
You deserve it 'cause you're perfect

[Outro: Dave East]
Perfect
You deserve it 'cause you perfect
You deserve it 'cause you perfect
You deserve it 'cause you perfect
Perfect
You deserve it 'cause you perfect
You deserve it 'cause you perfect
You deserve it 'cause you perfect
