[Intro]
You know I can address the rumors far for debate. But like Nas said, life is good, just deposited a couple really big checks. My voice is everywhere and my woman's the baddest. I really can't complain about nothin'

[Hook]
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch
They prayin' I don't make it
They treatin' me like I'm famous
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch

[Verse 1: Dave East]
We took it to the table and we broke it down
If they ain't want it before, I bet they want it now
Trip to Vegas, bettin' it all, that's a poker town
Beef and Broc, Polo brown, meet me by the polo grounds
Set up shop, let's get familiar, gotta know the town
Know the fiends and gotta know the way the police roll around
Porsche box with the mirror tint, they on us now
Take him to the river, one headshot, he'll slowly drown
With the fishes, now it's residence
Niggas lose it all just in the pursuit of presidents
I don't smoke trash, hit the bay, not talkin' pelican
Pills got these kids robbin' they mother for medicine
Four and a baby, I'm tryna stretch it
Couple pounds of regular, fuck it just take the exit
The Xannys in the Jansport
I really used to transport
Back and forth to Virginia I probably hit your man off
A couple niggas ran off
I see they tryna turn me to the old me
Thinkin' bout a homi for that bad work they sold me
Tryna pitch green since I was 15 in '03
In the field, the way I'm kickin' shit, go get a goalie

[Hook]
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch
They prayin' I don't make it
They treatin' me like I'm famous
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Champagne rains on your main bitch
The SLS doors do the crane kick
She only contemplates rappers if they famous
Finds drug dealers way more entertainin'
Guess I'm the best of both worlds
Minus the R. Kelly, the shoot outs are all Belly
Summertime Loubourtin, the bitches get all jelly
What's trash to Mayweathers is treasures to all Nellys
Is ya'll ready?
Ya'll just sit on the sidelines and blog heavy
I really buy shit, customize shit
Oxblood the interior then I drives it
Burn it out till that new body arrives in
EGHCK, you know what I sell
Prodigy wreaked havoc since juvenile hell
You say you push weight, shit I challenge the scale
Kingpin, King Push, I just balance it well, ah

[Hook]
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch
They prayin' I don't make it
They treatin' me like I'm famous
I don't complain about the pain
I'm just sippin' champagne with another nigga main bitch
