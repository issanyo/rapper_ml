[Verse 1]
I know 'bout the hustle
Lose it all
[Verse 1]
I know 'bout the hustle, I lost it and got it right back
I know how to stack, I keep it a stack, A hundred, not far from the strap
A flight to Japan, my Nikes was ten, my uncle got life in the can
Smoking flight with my man
I watch what I post, these niggas live life on the gram
I swiped and I scammed
Tomorrow not promised they leave niggas right where they stand
These niggas be groupies, I feel like Eminem when he writin' Stan
Got my life in my hand, predicted this shit all them nights I was playin'
I grew up 'round smokers, no lights in they crib, living trife for a gram
I put ice in the beam, thinking 'bout nights I would hide from them vans
Get some ice and Saran, my plug said he callin' me right when he land
I get right with the fam', told Kairi gon' make it, that's my little man
We supply and demand, I'm with the akhi for baggies, Mohammed, my man

[Hook]
Every nigga 'round me, cut throat
I could never roll up enough smoke
Money coming in, where the love go?
You ain't got no work, where your plug go?
Every nigga 'round me, cut throat
I could never roll up enough smoke
Money coming in, where the love go?
You ain't got no work, where your plug go?
Every nigga 'round me, cut throat
I could never roll up enough smoke
Money coming in, where the love go?
You ain't got no work, where your plug go?
You ain't got no work, where your plug go?
Money coming in, where the love go?
I could never roll up enough smoke
Every nigga 'round me, cut throat

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' to the face 'till the blunt low
I ain't ever gotta ask, "Where the blunt go?"
Got your bitch, a sweet chick on lo-low
'Bout to go head first on my nuts, woah
My connect came through in the clutch, tho
Used to hop on the train 'cause the bus slow
Bad boy, I ain't never meet Puff, tho
Tryna move but this sour got me stuck, hoe
I was sleepin' in the trap on a good night
Bully, treat niggas like he's Suge Knight
Strap on deck, fuck a good fight
Don't fuck up the blunt roll the 'wood right
All I ever knew was the hood life
All I ever seen was the quick cake
Way before I thought about a mixtape
I was down in Baltimore, tryna get weight (B-More)
On the turnpike with a whole thing
Put it in rice and he won't smell the cocaine
Get it tonight for that price but it's gon' change
We with the right, getting brain in the slow lane
Bloomie's and Barney's, it's regular
With this pistol, I feel like the Predator
No regular, I just want medical
With my schedule, I can't get next to you

[Hook]
Every nigga 'round me, cut throat
I could never roll up enough smoke
Money coming in, where the love go?
You ain't got no work, where your plug go?
Every nigga 'round me, cut throat
I could never roll up enough smoke
Money coming in, where the love go?
You ain't got no work, where your plug go?
Every nigga 'round me, cut throat
I could never roll up enough smoke
Money coming in, where the love go?
You ain't got no work, where your plug go?
You ain't got no work, where your plug go?
Money coming in, where the love go?
I could never roll up enough smoke
Every nigga 'round me, cut throat
