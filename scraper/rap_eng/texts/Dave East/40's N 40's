[Hook: Lex Lavo]
Looking like bishop in my 40 Lows
Brown paper bag with my 40 low
Sipping old English with my homies tho
East side shit is what they call it tho
(Repeat 2x)

[First Verse: Lex Lavo]
We bred different set different
Get bread different phone clicking
I’m on fire can’t get tired cause that chicken calling two more flips I might retire
This game is getting so crazy
You broke if you calling me a liar (Haha)
Check bussin funky moves on the daily tho
We was front page on that daily tho
Lex ave posted at the money spot
Dt’s eyeing we just wave when they rolling by(Hi)
That’s the routine that we living by
Rip to dee dee block miss you
Standing court side (Rip)
Those was the days that influenced me
Old heads flossing big chains
With there jewelry look at what that
Do to me got involved with the foolery
Pack boy turned connect during truency
I’m just out here trying to make
A living say my grace before I eat
Ya good homie thanks for giving

[Second Verse: Dave East]
Heard I’m fucking with Esco
This ain’t no ochie wallie
No sawed don’t chop that shotty
Make em move his body
I woke up in the projects
This ain’t no new buggati
Walikum salam (?)
Rocking coofy prolly
Nudie my denim usually groupie my women
In soho lucrative spending
This purple juice got me sinning
Spanish Harlem niggas jan shoppers
Gram coppers ya man watching
I see them d’s in the vans clocking
Killer first to lex was trying to kill them
Off the checks run in banks watching
For cameras now I’m getting it off respect
Rip to freaky free trav and charlie
Bully fresh out i smoke a lot
So no disrespect if you feeling left out
Free the whole gs9 nypd never wana
See no niggas eating fine
Pull up black db9 bbs on it
White niggas ain’t even got this
Feeling like mitch getting this chicken
While critics gossip

Some block shit
