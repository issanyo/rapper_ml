Shorty brought her friend with her
Knowing me, I would've been hit her
Blowing in the wind with her
This money I could spend with her
Said she brought her friend with her
Knowing me, I could've been hit it
Blowing in the wind with her
All this money I could spend with her
And I know, I know they frontin'
They be tryna hide what they be on, yeah
Said she brought a friend with her
Yeah, she brought a friend with her

[Verse 1: Dave East]
She telling me she got a friend
The club already packed but we just got 'em in
Everything on me tonight so she ain't gotta spend
When you come up from the bottom, all you wanna do is win
Jumping out some foreign shit, she got her best friend with her
Met her in the club a month ago, I could've been hit her
Now I got the top down, tryna let the wind hit her
Gotta keep a strap close ain't tryna have no kids with her
I'm just tryna make a movie with 'em
Bitches think they know me like he always got some groupies with him
Me and B was in the hoopty with 'em
Young niggas, bring 'em to the tele bet on who can hit 'em
She said her homie with the shits

Taking photos, now they bent, going loco on my...

[Verse 2: Mack Wilds]
Lately I been thinking different
The money's been coming in and incurring interest
Interesting shit, the ladies, they been known to flock me
But never met the type of women that could ever top me
I guess you think you make minds change
[?]
Pennies for these new thoughts, call it mind change
Oh, you tryna hit me with that god damn
I ain't a player but I crushed a lot
Games are won by inches and believe me girl, I won a lot
I say I'm playing but I'm really not
I'm just tryna hit your spot
And call up Tesha, tell her meet us at Liberty
I know that she feeling me
I felt it all up in her energy
If you with it how I'm with it
Then I let you have your way first
I mean whatever works
I'm the worst, right?
