[Intro]
One of the last real niggas alive
Truly believe that
I feel that
Prolly RT that

[Verse 1]
I did it all for the paper, I did it all for the cash
Chop up the grams wit' a razor, I got my man off his ass
I put my man on his feet, he ain't gotta give me shit back
Look in they face and they mad, that's just the way that I act
I got my bitch a bag, if she play me, I'm takin' it back
Brand new 600, I don't even drive, I just sit in the back
Play with that money, get kidnapped while your kids take a nap
I could see her phone, you just keep callin' while yo' bitch in my lap
I risked it all for a package, bought a Patek wit' the back-end
I'm gettin' neck all through traffic, I got respect to my casket
Niggas love it when you strugglin', they don't like it when you havin'
Fuck a chain, I bought another ratchet, mixed up designer, but it's matchin'

[Chorus]
In the hood we been famous, get rich wit' a scale and a razor
Respect gangsters and real shit, I cannot respect if you hatin'
My neck and my wrist like a glacier, I smoke 'til you think I'm from Asia
Get some money, I bet they gon' hate ya, I be gone when she wake up
In the hood we been famous, get rich with a scale and a razor
Respect gangsters and real shit, I cannot respect if you hatin'
My neck and my wrist like a glacier, I smoke 'til you think I'm from Asia
Get some money, I bet they gon' hate ya, I be gone when she wake up

[Verse 2]
I told that bitch take off her makeup
Come eat me while I smoke this eighth up
If I get a scale and a razor, you gon' think a nigga play for the Lakers
Or for the Clippers if you was a barber, my nigga, you could never fade us
Shorty don't work at the bank, but she like to chase, she won't get no pay stubs
Pay me to pull up, I hate clubs, I bend her over, don't make love
Not my C-Day, but I'm caked up, jumped the DJ, he ain't play cuz
Seats in the Wraith feel like fur, open up that safe or get murcked
To the trap, like Tom Shep and Bernie Mac, can't erase what we were

[Chorus]
In the hood we been famous, get rich wit' a scale and a razor
Respect gangsters and real shit, I cannot respect if you hatin'
My neck and my wrist like a glacier, I smoke 'til you think I'm from Asia
Get some money, I bet they gon' hate ya, I be gone when she wake up
In the hood we been famous, get rich with a scale and a razor
Respect gangsters and real shit, I cannot respect if you hatin'
My neck and my wrist like a glacier, I smoke 'til you think I'm from Asia
Get some money, I bet they gon' hate ya, I be gone when she wake up

[Outro]
Get rich wit' a scale and a razor
I be gone when she wake up
Get rich wit' a scale and a razor
I be gone when she wake up
