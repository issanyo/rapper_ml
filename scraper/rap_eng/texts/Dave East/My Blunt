Aoww!  Yeah Nigga!  Lighter!

(Verse 1: Dave East)
Fuck y’all mad at me for?
You don’t even know what I’ve been through
Look’in at me with them long stares
You don’t even know I’m on my man shoe
I’m float’in all through New York nigga (York)
You don’t even know how that Bens move
I’m on my mind and we strapped up
Gett’in clapped up when that rent due
No principles niggas move wrong (wrong)
Flow over due it’s been to long
Stomp’em out with no shoes on
Them fifty’s husky like UCONN (lighter)
Rock out like I knew Shonn
Fold your whole team futon
Whip the same color croutons
You niggas lukewarm you see the coupe gone
And I’m rid’in around for my bridge nigga
Dutch master for the block work
Up town my niggas got worth
We com’in in never knock first (never)
Stay high but I’m low key
All them riders they know me
A-K right beside I’m not lonely
But I’m try’in to make it rain down at K.O.D
I’m like ninomly he got crack (crack)
Took a couple of c-notes and I got back
All my niggas Debo better hide that
I bet your ego not as big as my strap (srap)
Shop bag go for fifteen you get two
Got a couple of big dreams when they get due
Body every sixteen I can spit too
Since sixteen cutt’in like a Ginsu
Rid’in in a rental (rid'in in a rental)

(Hook)
Crack, dope, coke, pills
Hash weed smoke chill
X-liquor in my cup
Come feell my dutch
I’m ‘bout to kill

Crack, dope, coke, pills
Hash weed, smoke chill
X-liquor in my cup
Come feell my dutch
I’m ‘bout to kill (lighter!)
I, I, I just want to smoke my blunt
I just want to smoke my blunt
I, I, I just want to smoke my blunt
I just want to smoke my blunt
I, I, I just want to smoke my blunt
Pass the weed ask for me
I just want to smoke my blunt
I, I, I just want to smoke my blunt

(Verse 2: Dave East)
Green gram on that snap back
Don’t cross me I’m a black cat (black)
Silver bullets and a black strap
Got dynamite in my backpack
I’m about to blow like a land mine (blow)
Niggas need tampons
I rep Harlem like Cam’ron (Harlem)
Still rock’in when the band gone
Motivate my man lock (beanie)
Set up shop on my man block
Run the city feel like Diddi
I won’t stop ‘cuz I can’t stop (I can't)
Clicquot winter white cup
Yo Molly’s here let’s get freaked out (hey)
Needs some water I’m start’in to sweat
I’m from the ‘jects them Div’s out
Fuck y’all mad at me for? (why?)
I’m about to blow like C-4
Shots let out and you detoured (dy'in)
Made a promise that I never want to be poor (never)
Dropped out mak’en my mom mad (sorry
Piss on niggas I got a strong bladder
I’m drunk and blunted it’s time to smoke
Gotta drop a hundred like the wong waggler (ahh)

(Hook)
Crack, dope, coke, pills

(Coughing)
Stop hitting it so hard
Hub you’re fuck’in up the rotation
Puff puff give, puff puff give
You’re fuck’in up the rotation
You can get kill with somebody else
That’s some serious shit, you lucky you my boy
(Uh shit) take your time
You got to crawl before you walk
