[Hook: Piif Jones 2x]
Told you before I want everything
Bitch I don't owe you a damn thing
I ducked the room when the vans came
We up in the club sippin' champagne
I don't know nothin' 'bout handouts
I just pray I get my man out
They see me, they pullin' they cam out
I get your bitch off the gram now

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I'm drinkin' lean at the steakhouse
Gorilla, I'm comin' in big now
Might take your bitch on a date now
I'm sellin' work with a Paypal
I got a plug on the Snapchat
I hide my gun in my backpack
Fuckin' your bitch in my dad hat
I made a hundred off trap rap
I'm in the cut with my thirty niggas
Fuckin' the club up with dirty niggas
Keep askin' for pictures, you thirsty nigga
Remember when they never heard a nigga
Stuck in the 'jects, a lil dirty nigga
Now up at Neiman's I blow thirty nigga
Above these groups, I think I'm Birdy nigga
Bitches used to really curve a nigga

[Hook: Piif Jones 2x]
Told you before I want everything
Bitch I don't owe you a damn thing
I ducked the room when the vans came
We up in the club sippin' champagne
I don't know nothin' 'bout handouts
I just pray I get my man out
They see me, they pullin' they cam out
I get your bitch off the gram now

[Verse 2: Dave East]
First off, free my nigga Dre Mack
Hard to make it where we stayed at
Queensbridge on a late night
Catch a nigga slippin' we gon' take that
Creep you down, I couldn't take that
Wish I really could erase that
Now I'm gettin' it like the white people
They don't understand how I made that
I was taking off the top
Right up off them bags, points, I can shave that
Baby girl you need to shave that
Ain't no way that I'mma save that
In the spot sippin' Belby
Shout my nigga Twelvyy, hit a nigga ASAP
You ain't never heard a K clap
I been that nigga since way back

[Hook: Piif Jones 2x]
Told you before I want everything
Bitch I don't owe you a damn thing
I ducked the room when the vans came
We up in the club sippin' champagne
I don't know nothin' 'bout handouts
I just pray I get my man out
They see me, they pullin' they cam out
I get your bitch off the gram now

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I'm in Barney's, I'm in Bloomy's
Niggas talkin' to me like they knew me
In the 90's I did Coogi
Meeting pornstars and coochie
Young fly nigga like Luchi
My life savage like Boosie
You ain't doin' no actin' in my movie
My shooters rude, they unruly
YSL to the floor nigga
Fucked your bitch cause I was bored nigga
Got a lot but I need more nigga
They know my name up in the store nigga
When I'm out they're takin' pictures
We don't leave no witness, money get the job done
If he got a plug, I'mma rob one
If he got a [?] I could buy some

[Hook: Piif Jones]
Told you before I want everything
Bitch I don't owe you a damn thing
I ducked the room when the vans came
We up in the club sippin' champagne
I don't know nothin' 'bout handouts
I just pray I get my man out
They see me, they pullin' they cam out
I get your bitch off the gram now

[Outro: Dave East]
I get your bitch off the gram now
They see me, they pullin' them...
They see me, they pullin' them...
I get your bitch off the gram now
They see me, they pullin' them cams out
They see me, they pullin' them cams out
I get your bitch off the gram now
Remember was giving them grams out
Pop, pop, ah, ah, ah
