[Spoken Word]
Karma
Sneakin' up behind you like a thief in the night
Sometimes you can't put up a fight
Watchin' what you doin' today
It might come back to you where ever you lay
It comes back in many forms
Knockin' on your door
Answer to see what's in store
Keep the darkness out
Bring the light in
Karma is what we call it
It may or may not be afraid
Your faith can be left in the hands of God or the devil
Speak life into positive energy
Pray off negativity
Practice what you preach
While your still prayin' for your enemies
It'll all come back to you
Directin' your own journey
Fallin' and gettin' back up again
Lovin' yourself and others around you
Your existence is challenged by karma
Choose wisely
