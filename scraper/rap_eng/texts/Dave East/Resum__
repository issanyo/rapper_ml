[Intro: Haddy Racks]
Yeah!
Take it back to that real New York shit
...block you from nigga?
What hood you rep nigga? Huh?
Start doing background checks on these niggas...
Check it...

[Chorus]
Check my resumé nigga, respect my gang
What hood you rep homie, what set you claim?
Who them niggas you was running round with?
What block you got money on?
What niggas you was out of town with?
Respect my gang
What hood you rep nigga? What set you claim?
Who them niggas you was running round with?
What block you got money on?
What niggas you was out of town with?

[Verse 1: Dave East]

Grimy ass New Yorker
They said light skin niggas is in, I couldn't be darker
Radiator not even workin' slept in my parka
My room freezing, that was more reason to be a monster
First I had the pills then I started bagging Reggie up
Couldn't get my hands on no coke, niggas was broke but momma, I wasn't beggin her

Spanish Harlem seen niggas rise until they had to fall
I had to ball hit the campus pitchin' Adderall
My shell toes was scuffed I tried to keep them clean
Never needed niggas for status ain't have to keep a team
I went to Baltimore posted by the corner store
Narcs with the Maryland plates - fuck'em we born to ball

Even in Queens I had the 2 for 15s
Fought a charge, cameras caught me on the roof wit a phene
Pissin in cups, probation duckin' the Fed case
Four Xannies in me, in pictures I got the dead face

[Chorus]
Check my resumé nigga, respect my gang
What hood you rep homie, what set you claim?
Who them niggas you was running round with?
What block you got money on?
What niggas you was out of town with?
Respect my gang
What hood you rep nigga, what set you claim?
Who them niggas you was running round with?
What block you got money on?
What niggas you was out of town with?

[Verse 2: Haddy Racks]

Racks!
I been getting dough on the block
I been a hustler since a teen, I might of got dough wit ya pops
Them old heads pointing at the gawd like "son is smooth"
Young nigga fronting on them broads in summer school

Still i never made it to jail I could weigh it by eye, I sold work that never made it to scales
And I use to play the building, wild niggas in some weird places
Posted in the lobby wit the pump under the staircases

Waiting for a nigga to front we was hustling on a hell block
I use to stash the work all in the mailbox
I went to school with holes in my clothes
I never had heat in my crib nigga, the water in my toilet bowl froze

They said I was too young to be out there moving that raw shit
We was on some poor shit, my momma couldn't afford shit
That's why I kept the hammer on my waist on a block full of gorillas
Strip look like the Planet of the Apes

[Chorus]
Check my resumé nigga, respect my gang
What hood you rep homie, what set you claim?
Who them niggas you was running round with?
What block you got money on?
What niggas you was out of town with?
Respect my gang
Nigga what set you claim?
