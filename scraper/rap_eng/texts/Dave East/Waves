Gotta get it so I really have no time to waste
I’m just trying to find out how your body taste
Lick the champagne off you, if I pop an ace
Ain’t get the head yet shit but I could wait
Looking for another like me you ain’t gon find'em
I think I need another box of condoms
Nothing better then you on top of me just ridin'
You ain’t gotta take'em off pull'em to the side and just watch a nigga slide in
I could put your legs on my shoulder and you could taste me while I’m driving
When I see you I just think 69
Do you ever think about your ex? Nevermind
I’m the only one that make you feel it in your spine
And you the only one thats ever really in my mind (real talk)
I like to bite, I like to choke
She like my type, she like my stroke, she got my vote
I pull her hair like I’m braiding
I’m into foreplay, let me play with it
Let’s get In the shower I’m trying to bathe in it
After the club, know who you staying with

I just wanna touch you, please you
Show I miss you babe
Kiss you
Fuck you
Surf you, ride your waves
I just wanna lick you, taste you
Make love to you babe
Kiss you
Fuck you
Surf you, ride your waves
