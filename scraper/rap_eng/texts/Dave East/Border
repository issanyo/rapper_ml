[Verse: Dave East]
...lawyer
Yeah, all of my shit look like water (splash)
I hit a lick for my daughter (lick)
Niggas got rich off of snorter (rich)
Freak little bitch, I record her (freak)
She call my phone, I ignore her (call)
She hold it down, I reward her (got 'em)
We got it pounds, don't deport 'em
But, they don't go down with no lawyer

[Chorus: [?] ]
Cold water (cold water)
Transported (transported)
Kill niggas, torture (torture)
Them bands, imported
Change 'em to the floor
Real nigga, border
All these bitches gon' smoke
I can't even step out the car
Cold water (cold water)
Transported (transported)
Kill niggas, torture (torture)
Them bands, imported
Change 'em to the floor
Real nigga, border
All these bitches gon' smoke
I can't even step out the car

[Verse: Dave East]
I can't even step out the car
We just might...
