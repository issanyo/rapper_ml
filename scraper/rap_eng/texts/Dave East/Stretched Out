[Intro]
Damn, see, I ain't left that
A hunnid cops on the corner
A nigga head was open, shit

[Chorus]
Nobody seen, they only heard what happened
This probably make the news, they left him stretched out
Grandmomma screamin' in the church, hit 'em where it hurt
Face up on the shirt every day niggas check out
Po-Po askin' questions, givin' names out
My youngings' itchin' if you trippin', blow your brains out
Blood all in your seat, it's hard to get them stains out
My niggas hang out but still they give cocaine out
Hey

[Verse 1]
Pourin' in my hood, I show you what that rain 'bout
See him shinin', got a thing for diamonds, test his chain out
Fiends say he gotta smoke dope 'cause he bore his veins out
Got some white chicks that go crazy, I pull some 'caine out
Flame out, barbeque niggas, see what this pain 'bout
Aim out, hellava target slept on that same couch
Both for a reason, hopefully hoes'll be creepin'
'Magine if Hov coulda seen us, this shit like openin' season
Recognize real appeal, coke, dope, crack, liquor, guppy
Thousand dollar sneakers, bitches know I'm that nigga
We could coast
Don't ask about what I gross, don't do the questions
Hard headed, ain't no lessons
I rob you before I'm stressin'
It's on

[Chorus]
Nobody seen, they only heard what happened
This probably make the news, they left him stretched out
Grandmomma screamin' in the church, hit 'em where it hurt
Face up on the shirt every day niggas check out
Po-Po askin' questions, givin' names out
My youngings' itchin' if you trippin', blow your brains out
Blood all in your seat, it's hard to get them stains out
My niggas hang out but still they give cocaine out
Hey

[Verse 2]
Things done changed
Ain't nobody fightin', niggas shootin'
Dice game, lose your life, momma askin' how she lose 'em
When that man came up, niggas caught him on that back block
Shot his Range up, snatched his chain up
War in these streets, kids ain't even safe
They shot him in his face, left a picture at his wake
Niggas hate when your wrists all rocked up
Clips stuffed up in that hammer, blocks get shot up
Pour some more Vodka
Talkin' like he got my back, shit, where that nine at?
Retaliate, Cognac and kush, bitches don't mind that
Told Rock call up my phone soon as you find that
Copy what he told me, robbed him for his Rollie
Caught a cab down the district, what I could get for this?
Said his man in Queens with coppers, shit, nigga, just pick a bridge

[Chorus]
Nobody seen, they only heard what happened
This probably make the news, they left him stretched out
Grandmomma screamin' in the church, hit 'em where it hurt
Face up on the shirt every day niggas check out
Po-Po askin' questions, givin' names out
My youngings' itchin' if you trippin', blow your brains out
Blood all in your seat, it's hard to get them stains out
My niggas hang out but still they give cocaine out
Hey

[Outro]
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
