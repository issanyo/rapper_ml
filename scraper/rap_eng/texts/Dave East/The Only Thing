[Intro: Dave East]
Uh, I fell in love with you early, it's dark and hell is hot
Around '97 fiends selling soap and selling socks
The only thing that kept me cool in this cold world
The streets got me under influence, I've been ruined

[Bridge: Abir Haronni]
I get to confessing my love
And you start to wonder expressing your questions
Like why? Like
I get to confessing my love
And you start to wonder expressing your questions
Like why? Like
Is that what you need love for?
What do you need?

[Hook: Abir Haronni]
All I want is you baby
You're the only one that keeps me cool baby
Keep me on my toes, I want you baby
Love I had the right to baby
Love you baby
You're the only one that keeps me cool baby
Keep me on my toes, I want you
I want you

[Verse 1: Dave East]
The culture what I care about
The cyphers on the stair cases
Me and my man got knocked, we had to share cases
I do it for the love, the hate keep the balance right
Red wine dining, it feel like a steak and salad night, uhm
Nothing in this world can compare to the music
Imagine changing your life after you said you'd do it
More respect than love so I ain't complaining
I'm vacation planting 'toes out in the Caymans
Thousands Islands, been violent long as I can remember
When your heat not working that's a different December
I got love for the game, I keep my mind humble
Realizing I'm surviving in a wild jungle
No stressing, learn lessons on how to save it
Now I got your favorite models naked
Survival is amazing
This Rollie like the ring of a champion
I used to tuck all of my work up under the Champion
Dumb wild nigga

[Hook: Abir Haronni]
All I want is you baby
You're the only one that keeps me cool baby
Keep me on my toes, I want you baby
Love I had the right to baby
Love you baby
You're the only one that keeps me cool baby
Keep me on my toes, I want you
I want you

[Verse 2: Dave East]
We just need enough for us to break down
Shake the town, even them other niggas relate now
Hate the small talk before they ask for something
Baby, don't ask me nothing
Came up off a couple grams, I'm used to not having nothing
My moms and pops tried they best but I wanted more
Niggas rather go shopping, I'm tryna own the store
I'm tryna own some more, equity, real estate I'm investing in
I go to work like I'm Mexican
Always get amnesia when they come in for questioning
Looking for medicine
Only rookie getting respect from the veterans
We was raw measuring, the scale broke, eyeball it
You afraid of contact, nobody fouled you so why call it?
Money flowing, I was staring at that white Taurus
Fiji bottles, I'm bougie, please get the white water
Went from a dime to a five after the lights caught her
Miami, we made a movie, I think I like Florida

[Bridge: Abir Haronni]
I get to confessing my love
And you start to wonder expressing your questions
Like why? Why?
I get to confessing my love
And you start to wonder expressing your questions
Like why? Why?
