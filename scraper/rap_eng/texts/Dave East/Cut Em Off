[Chorus: Dave East]
I had to cut a couple niggas off
I had to put a couple hitters on
Niggas talk too much, I ain't come here to talk
Spaceship through the ghetto, ain't nowhere to park
I had to cut a couple niggas off
I had to put a couple hitters on
Niggas talk too much, I ain't come here to talk
Spaceship through the ghetto, ain't nowhere to park

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I heard 'em say I ain't got no hit records
If I rap it now, I got yo' bitch naked
They ain't just start rattin', niggas been tellin'
I ain't out here cappin', niggas been jealous
I go and get the paper, they just conversatin'
I don't chat 'bout other men, I spend no time debatin'
Two-hundred-thousand just so I could race it
This is my operation, run it up 'til I could rake it
And now she notice diamonds frozen, got her tryna taste me
Rich and I'm rollin', fuck with Neighbors and I fuck with Grape Street
Already did so much without no album, can't replace me
I leveled up, now niggas angry, shit could never change me
Baby

[Chorus: Dave East]
I had to cut a couple niggas off
I had to put a couple hitters on
Niggas talk too much, I ain't come here to talk
Spaceship through the ghetto, ain't nowhere to park
I had to cut a couple niggas off
I had to put a couple hitters on
Niggas talk too much, I ain't come here to talk
Spaceship through the ghetto, ain't nowhere to park

[Verse 2: Don Q]
Yeah, I orchestrated the whole corporation
Totin' bangers, prayin' we avoid the station
Bitch, I get that pack and I go Walter Payton
Running back, I get a sack and let the corner taste it
Clockin' in, I work the night shift with that ready-rock
Longs you hit it with the right whip, they gon' steady cop
Please don't call me talkin' prices, make my celly hot
Said I ain't got hits, still buy the same jewelry that Nelly got
AP, fully loaded watches
Hoodie low, you see the fully pokin' out it
Window low, the smoke come out it
Back suburban, packin' burners
React and the smoke come out it
Hope you fast as Jackie Joyner when niggas convert to violence
They heard he stylin', my pockets used to have lint balls
Can't associate with these rodents, they make my skin crawl
Hit the first spot, make a movie, and then I spin off
Come back and make the spin-off
Fuck it, let's take the tint off, nigga

[Chorus: Dave East]
I had to cut a couple niggas off
I had to put a couple hitters on
Niggas talk too much, I ain't come here to talk
Spaceship through the ghetto, ain't nowhere to park
I had to cut a couple niggas off
I had to put a couple hitters on
Niggas talk too much, I ain't come here to talk
Spaceship through the ghetto, ain't nowhere to park
