[Intro: DJ Holiday and Dave East]
Let me fix my motherfucking crown, nigga
Knock a little dust off this bitch
DJ Holiday
Dave East
King of Harlem
For all you niggas that hated
This yo' karma, nigga
Uh
Started with nothing, now I'm up in Neiman's with 20 bands
I did the [?] and we dried the coke with the ceiling fan
I got the drop on my target, my niggas was marching on Million Man
I'm up in Harlem with all of my diamonds...

[Verse: Dave East]
Uh
Started with nothing, now I'm up in Neiman's with 20 bands
I did the [?] and we dried the coke with the ceiling fan
I got the drop on my target, my niggas was marching on Million Man
I'm up in Harlem with all of my diamonds on feeling like Killa Cam
Tell every nigga hating on me they could suck a dick
They know I could fuck they bitch
I probably hit me a hundred licks
We was really in that Crown Vic
All I need me is a down bitch
To take the product out of town quick
Can't be nervous, you around this
Louis got me wearing brown kicks
Looking like I stepped in dog shit
Bringing all my niggas on the road with me, I ain't chilling 'til we all rich
Nowadays, ain't gotta call chicks
Porsche drop with the fog tints
Jumping out of it like a frog do, kiss the plug wife when I walked in
I ain't got time for the talking
Killed them early, that's abortion
Everyday a nigga fresh, looking like I stepped right up by the coffin
Told my driver back the Porsche in
You want a feature, can't afford it
I bet I fuck her 'til the morning
This foreign like 100 horses
GG5 in the Backwood, got the car smelling like horse shit
All of my bitches is gorgeous
VVS is sitting flawless
I popped two percs and I'm nauseous
I got your bitch sitting court side
Fifty thousand to my lawyers the reason I'm sitting in court high
Karma
What goes around comes around, I hope you got some armor
Got yo' bitch in Banihana, she tryna change me like Obama
Eyes on the Fendi monster, staring at you niggas staring at me
LV Supreme the bomb
Hot temper need the ganja
Most of my denim is Fear of God
Only thing I ever fear was God
It was so hard to go get it, y'all
If they had that powder, we get it hard
I ain't got beef with no rap nigga
Say my name we gon' go get him robbed
Diamonds cold like when the heater off
You got some money, nigga, we can talk
I don't even take a weekend off
Everyday feel like a holiday
I'm only fucking with the legendary niggas, so I had to get with Holiday
I get the drop from a block away
You was that nigga, but not today
I'm in for the change, you here for the fame, if you in the game, learn how to play
All gas we don't touch breaks
I wore Gucci for two months straight
12 pounds in a Mustang
Your hands never touched weight
Your hands never touched guap
Downtown on a dust block
Hear this blowin' if this truck stop
Two words, nigga, "fuck cops"
Catch you lackin' by the bus stop
Awaiting on your train, homie
Blue and whites askin' 'bout me in the streets, but they ain't got a thing on me
Just trappin' like they ain't on us
Not a day I step out and they ain't on me
This nut in my pocket enormous
State to state with the Glock while I'm touring

[Outro: DJ Holiday]
This that Karma shit
All you lil niggas move over, let the big dogs eat
It's the big dog table
You don't belong here
Dave East
Shit
Holiday
East side of Harlem
