[Verse 1: Emeli Sande]
I'm writing this letter to tell you I miss ya
The kids' doing better, we hold it together
Saw Joe yesterday
And he told me to tell ya, "to stay strong my bro"
He said, "don't let them stress ya"
Alicia starts school in a couple of weeks
And she so damn excited she's counting her sleeps
And I'll send you some pics in her new uniform
I'm so sorry, my baby, it's taking so long now

[Chorus: Emeli Sande]
I'll come to visit you soon
Soon
It's just you know, I always got the kids in the afternoon
(Whooo)

[Verse 2: Emeli Sande]
And money's been low, so I'm doing whatever
The car had to go
Got two jobs in the summer
And while I remember, you know my girl, Stacy
She found out she pregnant with twins, ain't that crazy?
And Kenny's still mad
But you know how it is, he'll come 'round eventually
Don't take it personally
No right or wrong way for dealing with this
Everyone's still just adjusting, I guess

[Chorus: Emeli Sande]
Yeah, I'll come to visit you soon
Soon
It's just you know, I always got the kids in the afternoon
(Whooo)

[Verse 3]
And sometimes I daydream that I'm at home cooking
You come through the door and say, "hey there, good-lookin'"
I miss how you touch me, I miss how you love me
And look how they robbed me, I hate how they robbed me
See Jake started speakin', his first word was, "truck"
They say, "oh what surprise", just like father, like son
There's some days when the kids acting so fucking angry
It's breaking my heart when they asking, "where's daddy?"

[Chorus: Emeli Sande & Dave East]
I'll come to visit you soon
Soon
It's just you know, I always got the kids in the afternoon
Never know which way life 'gon come at you
Never know...

[Verse 4: Dave East]
This life come at you fast, so buckle up, don't crash
Plastic bags, packed them after class
Just thinking bachelor pads
Emotionally rich, physically broke
Negative seeds get planted, spirits could grow
Kids shouldn't know about our altercations
Keep it verbal
Told you I heard you
Being nosey have you caught up in issues that don't concern you
I wish... I wish that time could speed up, see if you worth the time
Pretend to be, fake enemies I've seen before, familiar kind
Yeah, I got your letter, ain't have time to read a million lines
It's from the heart, I understand, but you clever within your mind
Vices I could never shake
Options got a limit to 'em
Shiesty from where the children ruined
I'm what the strip influenced
After-school you get the kids, wasn't there when I did my bit
That's why you won't get to live with a Bad Boy, I did it B.I.G
Paid the rent
I kept you fresh
The crib was plush
I filled the fridge
Now we on some distant shit
You or her don't know which to pick
