[Intro]
We're a different breed baby
You're not ready for this life
You gotta jump without a parachute
Change your life with one swipe, aha
Oh, what they think about you
Fashion week in Paris, vacation on white sands
Yachts and shit, stay loyal, we got you

[Chorus: Floyd Miles]
I've been on some other shit lately (Holiday Season)
They tried to tell me settle down
But I'm done messing around, girl
Usually, this shit just don't phase me
But you held a nigga down
I've got all these women around me
Still you got a nigga in a day dream, day dream, day dream
Yeah, you got a nigga in a day dream, day dream, day dream (oh, nah)

[Verse 1: Dave East]
You on my mind like a verse that I ain't get to write
You outta town, I'll get ya flight, couple shots, hope I hit tonight (I hope)
I day dream 'bout your physical, get you alone, let's spend the night
Bag 'em directly, my aura like Wesley, call me Mr. Snipes
You got your own, I know you're independent, I just play your [??] (I know)
Talk with your eyes, I heard you clearly, ain't gotta say too much (head)
Her face, she hardly make it up
Caught me slipping, I'll make it up (my bad)
Her ex, he just ain't make enough
Fist sex soon as she waking up (wake up)
We smoking, knockin' Cam' shit
Day dreaming of "Come Home With Me" (Killa)
Don't trust her yet, we at the telly, she cannot come home with me
She sent the address, told me pull up on her, brought my chrome with me (.40)
Day dreaming 'bout them thighs, I can't wait to get her alone with me

[Chorus: Floyd Miles]
I've been on some other shit lately
They tried to tell me settle down
But I'm done messing around, girl
Usually, this shit just don't phase me
But you held a nigga down me
I've got all these women around
Still you got a nigga in a day dream, day dream, day dream
Yeah, you got a nigga in a day dream, day dream, day dream (oh, nah)

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I know this girl that had me leaving my team (I know)
Her pussy good, can never leave her on seen (never)
Know how to speak to a Queen (queen)
She was from Brooklyn, said let's meet up in Queens (bridge)
Can't wait to taste her, somethin' 'bout her said she keep her shit clean (mmm)
She Instagram'ing, posting pictures on a daily basis
The Weeknd or Drake, her playlist
She classy but niggas from the streets her favourite
I like her when I'm actually sober, she don't do the Fashion Nova
My other chick tripping, she left for lipstick in back of the Rover
You try to trick on her, show love, but not even that could control her
I hit it playing 2K, she begged me to pass the controller (hah)
Brunch in the afternoon in the heights when they actually approached us
Got caught day dreaming, this the same bitch I had on the poster (gone)

[Chorus: Floyd Miles]
I've been on some other shit lately
They tried to tell me settle down
But I'm done messing around, girl
Usually, this shit just don't phase me
But you held a nigga down
I've got all these women around me
Still you got a nigga in a day dream, day dream, day dream
Yeah, you got a nigga in a day dream, day dream, day dream (oh, nah)

[Interlude: Girl]
Yo, what the fuck is up with you, you fucking clown ass nigga?
You got me fucking leaving voicemails now?
I'm fucking calling you, I'm texting you, I'm leaving you fucking voicemails and shit now
And you can't call me back but you on fucking Instagram posting?
Like you got me fucked up
I don't know what the fuck done gotten into you
I don't know if it's this little deal and you think you the shit now
But let me fucking tell you something
You better not let me find out you been fucking around

[Chorus: Floyd Miles]
I've been on some other shit lately
They tried to tell me settle down
But I'm done messing around, girl
Usually, this shit just don't phase me
But you held a nigga down
I've got all these women around me
Still you got a nigga in a day dream, day dream, day dream
Yeah, you got a nigga in a day dream, day dream, day dream (oh, nah)

[Outro]
Oh, what they think about you
