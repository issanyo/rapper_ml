[Intro: Future]
I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I gotta get up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I can't get up
But I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I gotta get up
I'm slippin', I was fallin'
Yeah I bet I'll get up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I know I'm gettin' up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I better get up
But I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I gotta get up

[Chorus: Future]
Use that money for motivation
Them same ones that came up with me hatin'
When money talkin', it can change a conversation
They'd rather see me locked in shackles, watch me take off
I'm dedicated, but I'm runnin' out of patience
Hopin' these pain pills take away frustration
We drinkin' lean and pourin' up until the eighth gone
On medication, me and Satan conversatin'

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Okay that lean had me slippin', damn dawg you trippin'
Had to tell my niggas and stay focused on the mission
Now we at the Grammys, started in the kitchen
And I brought the family, fuck them other niggas
Cause ain't nobody listen when I told 'em I would blow
Now the VIP be crowded every city that I go
Shorty said she like my style, I be thinkin', "Yeah I know"
Would've never gave me play back in the day when I was broke
So I ball hard, post it on the 'Gram just to motivate 'em
When you're gettin' money, niggas' broke, they supposed to hate it
Hurt my heart when I seen my closest homie caught the vapors
Gotta watch 'em closely, backstabbers didn't poke me
Shot me, brought me down on my knees, tried to Derrick Rose me
Won 'em a ring, still did me like I was Kobe
Talked down on me when they thought that I slipped
You niggas crazy if you thought I would quit, no!

[Chorus: Future]
Use that money for motivation
Them same ones that came up with me hatin'
When money talkin', it can change a conversation
They'd rather see me locked in shackles, watch me take off
I'm dedicated, but I'm runnin' out of patience
Hopin' these pain pills take away frustration
We drinkin' lean and pourin' up until the 8th gone
On medication, me and Satan conversatin'

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Yo, bein' broke is so embarrassin', got sick of wastin' time
I took some packages to Maryland
Me and Leek, couple pounds of tree in the caravan
Before I ever wrote a rhyme, I had a scam
Might have been young, but I had a plan
I wanted designer clothes
Pooch was in the kitchen with a lot of coke
I wanted this money since a snotty nose
We was in the staircase, watchin' fiends driftin' off
Now it's Teterboro flyin' private jets, liftin' off
Tell the pilot I just need to know when we about to land
I was watchin' Ds sendin' out them vans
Stashed a couple pieces in my Nike sock
Never could I like a cop
My man ain't know his mother used to like to cop
Damn, homie
A Cuban chain and a Rollie'll make your man switch
Same one you flipped grams with and split your sandwich
Meek told me just get this money and motivate 'em
It's no debatin', if you broke we ain't got no relation
Harlem!

[Chorus: Future]
Use that money for motivation
Them same ones that came up with me hatin'
When money talkin', it can change a conversation
They'd rather see me locked in shackles, watch me take off
I'm dedicated, but I'm runnin' out of patience
Hopin' these pain pills take away frustration
We drinkin' lean and pourin' up until the 8th gone
On medication, me and Satan conversatin'
