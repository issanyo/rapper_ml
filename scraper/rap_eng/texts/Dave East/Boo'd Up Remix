Huh, Vado
We the
We the
Most hated

[Vado}
Feelings, so deep in ya feelings
That ya friends always squealing
When you know I be chilling
Dope dealings
Got me making a killing
And they not in the building
Half a mil in the ceilings

Uh, ass so honey fat
I'm slowly sipping on honey jack
It's funny that I got money
And always running back
You wanted that
Now ya price higher, I cover that
Table full of hunnits
Some house keys up under that
Her heart race this broad pace
Got far space to move on
I choose wrong
Before a car chase I'm too calm
Ya knew moms and all my best friends
Time spent on the west end at the Western
I'm wild bent and venting
Til I'm bipolar like why hold her
Face shot like a foul odor
You just smell, I pulled up, he just bailed
It's written all over ya face can just tell
You look sick like a young thot
On some hood shit
He booked ticks, you took trips
Hoping for good dick
I'm good Miss
Thank God ain't lay this good fist
I stood pissed, no kiss
Come get this foot print
Vado

I told my daughter mother
Forever you stuck with me
I'm sucka free
Thinking 'bout them nights
We used to fuck to sleep
New bitches on my line
Claiming that they in love with me
New crib came with a jacuzzi
Come jump inside this tub with me
But I don't let it trouble me
Step in the club and women hugging
Couple gangstas round me
I told them cover me
She told me if I wasn't famous
She probably be cuffing me
I heard you
Then I text her the address right to the double tree
She taking selfies while we just coolin'
They think we boo'd up
The high tec had me fuck her in slow motion
I was screwed up
Not to pardon this
We have an argument it fuck my mood up
I hit bitches with my gun on my hip
With her, put my tool up
She know I love them Gucci fits
Never been to one show
Said she not on no groupie shit
Hold the hammer she too legit
Knew her since I was dead broke
Better not change if you get rich
Pay no attention
Them bitches with you got nun to do with this
