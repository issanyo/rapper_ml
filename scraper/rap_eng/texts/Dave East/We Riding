[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Niggas chose to leave, and they did
I made a wave, I build the bricks
I was riding, late night drinking
Smoking, thinking about my kids
I was really riding with the Sig
I'ma miss the Molly with the Henn'
I'ma put the .50 in the G
I'ma climb the streets once again
We ridin'
These niggas don't be outside when they say it though, oh (they outside)
Yeah, we ridin'
These niggas don't bring no money, like they say they do
Oh, oh we ridin'

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
A lotta young niggas be on them pills
If a girl go' tell, tell her, "Go drill"
No Meek, but I need them Mills
Up late night, ain't missing no meals
Gotta duck low 'cause the feds on us
Let her catch me, that's a big bonus
And be saucin' like Rick Owens
And I sell white, no Nick Jonas
Like we don't be outside, you lying
If you try me, you dying
And we do this all the time
And if you real, so we do not have to rhyme
I be swerving niggas down
I would never drop a dime
A lotta niggas, they be lying
If you lying, that's a crime
If you snitch, that's a dime
Ay, I'ma pull up in a Bentley truck
I'ma drive slow, you could see the guts
Catch [??] fifty Glocks
If you live in the war, can't take a bus
And I know some niggas that'd take a risk
Phillipe on his rm, we gon' take a wrist
I know some rappers can't take a diss
And I tell them niggas, "Just miss me with that shit"

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Niggas chose to leave, and they did
I made a wave, I build the bricks
I was riding, late night drinking
Smoking, thinking about my kids
I was really riding with the Sig
I'ma miss the Molly with the Henn'
I'ma put the .50 in the G
I'ma climb the streets once again
We ridin'
These niggas don't be outside when they say it though, oh (they outside)
Yeah, we ridin'
These niggas don't bring no money, like they say they do
Oh, oh we ridin'

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Making these niggas look jealous
This jacket is Mason Margiella (uh)
I pull up and flex on whoever (flex)
I used to polish my leather
I'm in Sac with a dime on me
Designer, everything you find on me
From the bottom, had to grind, homie
Pocket rocket, DB9 on me
Gorillas living in the zoo
Now I got a bird sittin' in the Coupe
I won't say a word, if I know the truth
Case dismiss, couldn't show the proof
Ferrari pulling off roof, vrrm
We the realist niggas up in the room
A couple scammers and a couple goons
A couple sticks and a couple of brooms
Swoop any nigga right off
Get out your seat
I need that new Patek Phillipe
All of my bitches is freaks, we fuck every time that we link
I put no 10's on a ring, sliding by a nigga screaming, "That look like East"
Two baby .40s, a hunnid a piece
Me and Durk, really come from the streets

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Niggas chose to leave, and they did
I made a wave, I build the bricks
I was riding, late night drinking
Smoking, thinking about my kids
I was really riding with the Sig
I'ma miss the Molly with the Henn'
I'ma put the .50 in the G
I'ma climb the streets once again
We ridin'
These niggas don't be outside when they say it though, oh (they outside)
Yeah, we ridin'
These niggas don't bring no money, like they say they do
Oh, oh we ridin'
