[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm walking through Harlem like I'm Richard Porter
If your wifey ain't feeling me, I could get your daughter
My cousin sold dust he said he tryna get some water
Fish scale on my side of town is what niggas order
Felt like orphans in school, them teachers didn't want us
We hit them corners, that's the reason that the precinct on us
For the pound block, dancing like Bobby Brown
Put a bomb in your building, I'm shutting your lobby down
They be talking that tough shit the Hudson probably found
Floating with fishes, family bitching, they not around
Pull up not hitting switches, this Harlem don't come around
Used to rock the Pradaaaa
Hop out like a rasta like I just was watching Shottas
Kicked out of school, I had a razor in my locker
Felt like Bishop, I'm the one y'all need to worry bout, parther
Different type of ora, I'ma need a lawyer
Momma cooking GOYA before Sapp was a Hoyer
I got some head from Toya, I was busy, couldn't call ya
Me and Mac at the butter spot, your bitch said she she love the cock
I'm always on first cause I love the block
My little nigga said he never fighting, he love his Glock
We savages, a blood spill is nothing, we love the mop

[Hook]
Figured I would trap until I really made it
Two pistols on me, we could get acquainted
Brand new Beamer, bout to get it painted
They think I'm famous, hit everybody, he couldn't aim it
Figured I would trap until I really made it
Two pistols on me, we could get acquainted
Brand new Beamer, bout to get it painted
They think I'm famous, hit everybody, he couldn't aim it

[Verse 2]
In the kitchen with some grams, I was listening to Cam
Sending pictures of my fam to my niggas in the can
Was pitching and I scammed, visions of some land
Whipping in the pan had you feeling like the man
Illest on the coast, you ain't living if you broke
I know about coke droughts, niggas selling soap
I know about the shower being cold for like three days
Boiling water to clean my body before a cheap date
Knowing I'm just tryna fuck, addicted to designer stuff
Still got marks on my wrists, been in all kind of cuffs
Xanax, mushrooms, kush, I sold all kind of stuff
Own family tried to rob me, I don't got no kind of trust
The way that I think, no time for waiting
You either broke or jealous if you ever got time for hating
I'm from the city move fast, ain't got no kind of patience
Obama tried to change it, we still in the projects waiting
We waiting

[Hook]
Figured I would trap until I really made it
Two pistols on me, we could get acquainted
Brand new Beamer, bout to get it painted
They think I'm famous, hit everybody, he couldn't aim it
Figured I would trap until I really made it
Two pistols on me, we could get acquainted
Brand new Beamer, bout to get it painted
They think I'm famous, hit everybody, he couldn't aim it

[Outro]
