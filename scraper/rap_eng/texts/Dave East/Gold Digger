[Verse 1: Dave East]
Uh, 980 hoodie Mike Amiri, Louis Damier duffle bag matching
Flowing like I practice black magic
Hundred thousand on me with a black ‘matic
I was school shopping with my mom money
Now I tell my jeweler flood my arm for me
I’m in Gucci blowing car money
I can tell these niggas never saw money
I pick up a bag if I walk through
Want a feature I’m not who you talk to
I’m bout to get Kairi a puppy
The shit that you making I blow it on dog food
It was not no better tryna find a lever
It was freezing out I couldn’t find my sweater
Times I mention we applying pressure
Found a brand new 40 like I’m finding treasure
I ain’t coming out it ain’t a dime or better
Diamonds on me look like Fiji water
Never thought that it'd be me recording
Rob ya mother just to feed my daughter
I was burning bags before I seen a quarter
I am not the one, they saying we extorted
Fuck her send her back like she deported
I was jumping out a cab with weed and water
Promoters tell me its a lot of us
I was on the greyhound with a lot of dust
If you not a hater then you proud of us
Bagging powder smoke until we outta blunts
Pour up until we run out of cups
I’m that nigga that shit is so obvious
These jeans cost me 1490
My team grimy don’t follow us

[Pre-Chorus: Dave East]
I got ya wife in my section her phone off
Pull up in the foreign they wonder how much do the chrome cost
I was a worker I hustle now bitch I’m my own boss
We after the witness only way I know that they won't talk

[Chorus: A Boodie Wit Da Hoodie]
Dolce and Gabbana mix it up with Enfants Riches
Nigga I was born gifted
Smoke a 50 with my niggas thinking bout the millions I hope that we all get it
Bitch I’m on a mission I can't tell you about a sentence I don’t need no witness
I just spent like 50 on some fucking boogers nigga I’m a gold digger

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Reach for the gold, I'ma reach for you bitch so put the pole in her
Stains on the stove, but I wasn't cooking dope in the kitchen boning her
Chains so damn iced out, bet you can't see the fucking gold in them
And I walk on beats, I got the key, I'm  a custodian
All day, all my niggas rocking dog chains
I've been killing shit since I was fourteen
Tell the plug that I need the whole thing
Fuck a little bit, the whole thing
Take the what and leave the what, the whole thing
Think I need another pair of Balmains
So my niggas pull up and they all game
Time fly while I'm scheming
Pop a perc and then I started tweaking
In a room full of temporary bitches that you prolly never even seen in
These niggas wanna give me reasons
Now I'm looking for a fucking reason
So I tell a bitch, I'll be your side nigga, if you watch a nigga, they be heated, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Dave East]
I got ya wife in my section her phone off
Pull up in the foreign they wonder how much do the chrome cost
I was a worker I hustle now bitch I’m my own boss
We after the witness only way I know that they won't talk

[Chorus: A Boodie Wit Da Hoodie]

Bitch I’m on a mission I can't tell you about a sentence I don’t need no witness
I just spent like 50 on some fucking boogers nigga I’m a gold digger

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I pop a perc I might doze off
I just wanna win and take no loss
I feel like the Mac I knock hoes off
I got ya bitch right out her clothes dog
Vuitton my denim I can send a couple cons to get ‘em
Uber ya bitch send a car to get her
Jealously real that’s on God they bitter
I was tryna bag 100 grams
I went to Brazil for another tan
I ride with G money like Duh Duh Man
Loc will come through ya window like Brother Man
My Prezi the suite my Prezi the rollie
I go to the beach because I love the sand
In my city the hottest
I stopped wearing Prada’s
My diamonds is doing the running man

[Chorus: A Boodie Wit Da Hoodie]
