[Intro: Y.K.C.]
Made me think smarter
Made me go harder
Every time

[Chorus: Y.K.C.]
The slums made me think smarter
The struggle made me go harder
Every time, every time, every time
The slums made me think smarter
The struggle made me go harder
Every time, every time, every time

[Verse 1: Omelly]
It's two thousand worth of crack, a hundred dogs in my sack
I wasn't grindin' on the block, I got it all from the jack
Older brother, he was Truman, I just followed his tracks
At the age of 18, I got booked for two gats
Did my two years, came home, had two kids
Out here on a mission, barely had a place to live
I'm really bustin' beer from all the shit that I did
Everything I got, I hustled for, I never had a gig
No court case 'cept the coke case, that's how I learned my lesson
These niggas tellin', how the fuck we gon' respect 'em?
They gave my dawg a life sentence, made me think smarter
It's time to go harder for my son and my daughter

[Chorus: Y.K.C.]
The slums made me think smarter
The struggle made me go harder
Every time, every time, every time
The slums made me think smarter
The struggle made me go harder
Every time, every time, every time

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Flipped a couple dimes, started this hustle off a quarter back
Before Ubers, was callin' cabs, you good, just don't take off your mask
Couple home invasions, I'm glad nobody was home, though
Homicide just waitin'
Nina came with me, she got that chrome glow (Nine)
Ninety-nine point nine percent of these niggas is bozos (Clowns)
Rap slow up, keep a plug close, get back that coke flow
A chokehold, block under the armpit, never tarnished
Chucks and Dickies, put my all in, now double C's on these garments
Performin' is my callin', early shifts, I worked the mornings
Body itchin', Perc dippin', deepest talks with alcoholics
Stand for Allah, hope this prayer work
Proud for what? In pain, I'm never say it hurt
I'm grimy, slimy, blind him on his way to work

[Chorus: Y.K.C.]
The slums made me think smarter
The struggle made me go harder
Every time, every time, every time
The slums made me think smarter
The struggle made me go harder
Every time, every time, every time
