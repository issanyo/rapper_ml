[Intro]
That be Maaly Raw

[Verse 1: Dave East]
If you don't come get it, I'm taxin'
I'm rollin' kush up in traffic
Got in the club with my rachet
Bitch you a dub, get to packin'
They never thought this would happen
I should just better myself
I ain't even gotta touch the pussy
That shit get wet by itself
Nas got me out the projects
Real nigga, ain't too many of us
Whole sale, less is more
It never works, bitch, there's plenty of us
Never hesitant, I really want it
Automatic, I'm a semi-somethin'
Caught 'em lackin' they ain't hear me comin'
Them shots'll really finish somethin'
I'm just gettin' younger, Benji Button
Calm down bitch, the Henny comin'
You a clown and we really know it
Only brown and we really pour it
In your town, you should get to know us
Sent some pounds down to Pensacola
I got broads out in Minnesota
Really used to think this shit was over
Overtime, still puttin' work
Even though a nigga's shift is over
Got the baddest bitches bendin' over
She told me that she into sniffin' coca
Understand that I'mma walk in lit
I don't hear nigga's talkin' shit
My cousin got to spend in prison yards so I gotta answer when he call again

[Hook: Dave East]
Run up a check on these niggas
Watch how I flex on these bitches
Run up a check on these niggas
Watch how I flex on these bitches
Run up a check on these niggas
Watch how I flex on these bitches
Watch how I flex on these bitches
Run up a check on these niggas
Run it up

[Verse 2: Kur]
I don't know what nigga's talkin', I'm good
Up top shit, this for the hood
Death Row shit, feelin' like Suge
Put my mind to it, knew that i could
Young and heartless and I misunderstood
Gas station had to [?] to get [?]
Love my hood, still be in my hood
I remember hidin' weed in the bush
Uptown ain't as sweet as it look
[?] before wanna see me get booked
All my life I used to hang with the crooks
All they like they used to pray for a jukes
Stay down and I waited so much
That's your bitch? I'mma take her to lunch
Niggas talk shit 'til they get touched
Timing everything, game in a rush
Grinding every day just to get up
Niggas gone broke just to keep up
When you talk to me, nigga speak up
Niggas walkin' up, they gon' creep up
Get your ass shot tryna be tough
You gon' lose yourself tryna be us
Nigga's talkin' about linin' me up
How I got it man? I grinded it up

[Bridge: Kur]
Love my hood and I still be in the hood
Love my hood and I still be in the hood
Love my hood and I still be in the hood
Love my hood and I still be in the...
Love my hood and I still be in the hood
Love my hood and I still be in the hood
Love my hood and I still be in the hood
Love my hood and I still be in the....

[Hook: Dave East]

Watch how I flex on these bitches
Run up a check on these niggas
