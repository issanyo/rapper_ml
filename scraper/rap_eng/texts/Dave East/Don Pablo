[Hook]
Bitches call me Don Pablo
Louis Vutton poncho
Photos with my eyes low
Strapped wherever I go
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

[Verse]
Yola in the bando
Rolling up in Franco
Toe tag and won't brag about it now you John Doe
If you need a joint play the point, Rondo
Tanning out in Cali, El Segundo
Left your baby momma with her mind blown
Took a trip to Cabo
Nigga got some work, now he think he El Chapo
Masked up, hoodie low creeping through your block slow
Tryna find a lick, we could split, get the nachos
Swerving off the Henny but I'm watching out for potholes
Thinking of them nights I was stressing in the box bro
Chiefing like tanto , only afford McDonald's, OJ
I'm in the Bronco, me and Blanco
Spanish buy steak and cilantro, el guapo
I only count to quatro, coco for your nostril
Shining everywhere I walk I make the whole block glow
Fly young nigga getting to it, bet your pops know
Hottest in my city, all the judges and the cops know
Call my nigga Gato, my jeans used to be Paco
Baby mother Spanish nigga, fell in love with tacos
I was in Miami up in Liv, me and Capo
Mad under covers in the building, I did not know
I come from the town that's famous for the Apollo
When you getting money, even famous bitches swallow
Hit it from a DM, I ain't even have to follow
Ros√© to the face, I ain't never passed the bottle
I'm always sick, I don't never need a doc note
2DopeBoy, I'm always looking like I got coke

Strapped wherever I go
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Bitches call me Don Pablo
Louis Vutton poncho
Photos with my eyes low
Strapped wherever I go
Nigga got some work, now he think he El Chapo
Nigga got some work, now he think he El Chapo

[Outro]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Bitches call me Don Pablo
