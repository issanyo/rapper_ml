[Intro]
It's Holiday Season, bitch
I'm back
I really ain't going nowhere
Y'all niggas really want this shit again?
Luxury leather, nigga
Well fuck it, let's go

[Chorus]
Audemar face, the car came with drapes
Your bitch spent the night, she calling in late (calling in late)
The cameras was on us, we walked in so late
Nobu for dinner, got shark on my plate
Just come to my room, I'm not tryin' to date
Tryna book me, just send me that bag, pick a date
She ain't used to the stars, kick that hoe out the Wraith
Get money fuck bitches and get out of--

[Interlude: DJ Holiday & Dave East]
I thought y'all niggas was good after the first one
I'm back
Shieet, DJ Holiday
Really ain't going nowhere
Dave East!
Karma 2!
Legendary shit, niggaa!
Luxury leather, nigga

[Chorus]
Audemar face, the car came with drapes
Your bitch spent the night, she calling in late (calling in late)
The cameras was on us, we walked in so late
Nobu for dinner, got shark on my plate
Just come to my room, I am not tryin' to date
Tryna book me, just send me that bag, pick a date
She ain't used to the stars, kick that hoe out the Wraith
Get money fuck bitches and get out the way

[Verse 1]
The streets told me East, please just put out a tape
Gorillas in Louie, don't wear too much Bape (Louie)
It's not my C-Day, but I got too much cake
Your shit not gon' work bro, you got too much hate
That jealousy came you, watch me get paid (watch me)
Plot on niggas, I'ma watch 'em for days (watch 'em)
Might got a Rover but you're not in my Range (skrt)
Nothing have you more nervous than buying cocaine

[Chorus]
Audemar face, the car came with drapes
You bitch spent the night, she calling in late (calling in late)
The cameras was on us, we walked in so late
Nobu for dinner, got shark on my plate
Just come to my room, I am not tryin' to date
Tryna book me, just send me that bag, pick a date
She ain't used to the stars, kick that hoe out the Wraith
Get money fuck bitches and get out the way

[Verse 2]
I'm only thinking 'bout how much I can make
Take a trip and be right back in a day
I'm getting money, can't react off the hate
Don't care 'bout how you knew me back in the day
Never thought I'd be packing out shows (never)
Don't get too close, this shit's strapped on my waist (blaw)
Pick up bags on the road, then get back with the bros
Thinking I want a purge with no mask on my face

[Chorus]
Audemar face, the car came with drapes
Your bitch spent the night, she calling in late (calling in late)
The cameras was on us, we walked in so late
Nobu for dinner, got shark on my plate
Just come to my room, I'm not tryin' to date
Tryna book me, just send me that bag, pick a date
She ain't used to the stars, kick that hoe out the Wraith
Get money fuck bitches and get out the way

[Verse 3]
Diamond feel like the winter
She never had Nobu for dinner
I just got some dome in a sprinter (argh)
Talking that tough shit, we know that you timid
Honestly, I ain't been broke in a minute
You started this shit, I just hope you can finish (I hope)
Keep calling my phone, I just hope that it's business (I hope)
On the block with my old heads just sipping the Guinness (old head)
In the game, you be nervous, to me, it's a scrimage

[Chorus]
Audemar face, the car came with drapes
Your bitch spent the night, she calling in late (calling in late)
The cameras was on us, we walked in so late
Nobu for dinner, got shark on my plate
Just come to my room, I am not tryin' to date
Tryna book me, send me that bag, just pick a date
She ain't used to the stars, kick that hoe out the Wraith
Get money fuck bitches and get out the way
