[Intro]
Turn up team, you bitch

[Chorus: Jermaine Elliott]
I know you tryna be somebody
I see you up at all of them parties
Let me introduce you to the gang
Cause bitch, you gotta fuck somebody
You hoggin' up the drink and the Molly
You wanna post Snaps in the 'Rari
So, let me introduce you to the gang
'Cause, bitch, you gotta fuck somebody
'Cause we not just anybody, we not just anybody
Let me introduce you to the gang right now
'Cause you need to fuck somebody

[Verse 1: Tru Life]
I see you on the beat in new Burgos
On the Facebook Live in a new Ghost
You wanna get a rap nigga or a trap nigga then cash out for a new tote
Damn, you's leather for the new coat, on the hit star list, blow through the notes
Every other day it's, 'this table, that table'
I'm like, "Girl, you tryna do the most"
Introduce you to the gang when we link up
Dicks on the house, bitch, drink up
Ride 'round like I'm ridin' in a Brink's truck
But we ain't spendin' nothin' on these smuts
Sorry but you gon' have to fuck if we go to town
And make her tap out 'til she throw the towel
I know she want free weed and free liquor
The only thing I want free is my niggas

[Chorus: Jermaine Elliott]
I know you tryna be somebody
I see you up at all of them parties
Let me introduce you to the gang
Cause bitch, you gotta fuck somebody
You hoggin' up the drink and the Molly
You wanna post Snaps in the 'Rari
So, let me introduce you to the gang
'Cause, bitch, you gotta fuck somebody
'Cause we not just anybody, we not just anybody
Let me introduce you to the gang right now
'Cause you need to fuck somebody
'Cause we not just anybody, we not just anybody
Let me introduce you to the gang right now
'Cause you need to fuck somebody

[Verse 2: Dave East]
How you think I'm about to wife you, you wit' err'body?
You ain't low, niggas see you up in every party
You been cheatin' on your nigga, you ain't never sorry
I got the pussy for free, you ain't never charged me
I got the head, I was in Vegas me and Tru had your bitch all in the loo
Ain't with the one on ones, I be pickin' by the group
Two-seater, watch me try to fit 'em in the coupe
Brought her to the studio, I beat that shit up in the booth
Could never call it love but I had O-D
I been that niggas since '03
Chanel on her bag, double C's on my sneakers
Wakin' up to that pussy on an island for a week
Get wild, three rounds, then let's see who go to sleep
Bed soakin' wet, change the cover then the sheet
She ain't know I was a freak but she gotta let the gang hit it
If not, she'll be walkin' up the street
I'm the type of nigga might turn you out for a week
Hey, you thinkin' what'chu 'bout to tell your nigga 'fore you speak?
Lately, I'm in all of these bitches' dreams
Orgy for the squad, bet they all'll hit the team

[Chorus: Jermaine Elliott]
I know you tryna be somebody
I see you up at all of them parties
Let me introduce you to the gang
Cause bitch, you gotta fuck somebody
You hoggin' up the drink and the Molly
You wanna post Snaps in the 'Rari
So, let me introduce you to the gang
'Cause, bitch, you gotta fuck somebody
'Cause we not just anybody, we not just anybody
Let me introduce you to the gang right now
'Cause you need to fuck somebody
'Cause we not just anybody, we not just anybody
Let me introduce you to the gang right now
'Cause you need to fuck somebody
