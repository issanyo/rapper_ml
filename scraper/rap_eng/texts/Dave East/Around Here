[Verse 1: Dave East]
A hundred gold chains when I'm laid to rest
I need a hundred percent, shit you can take the rest
Pussy wet every time we fuck she make a mess
All these niggas going right figured I'd make a left
Designer everything like what to wear now
They never paid attention I can feel the stares now
Elevator broke we gotta take a staires now
I ain't trynna fight this mack'll knock a beer down
Nightmares from the abortion that my ex had
Lookin forward to a better future had a stressed past
In my opinion who they be calling the best is trash
I'm still out making sells catching the next cab
My father did five straight in Soledad
And now I'm twenty-five
He really let me know his past
He was BGF rob the bank wildin
Couple thousands for they [?]
Told me son don't waste your talent

[Hook: Dave East]
Black constructs with the black hoodie
I cried like a baby when they snatched Bully
I came up in projects when it's dark
On side nobody talking it ain't save around here

[Bridge: Dave East]
I did my dirt I'm not sorry
I cry like a baby when they locked Charlie
I don't trust nobody breathing
Got my name up in prison
Catch a case around here

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I was holding a smoke holding a cracks
Them niggas [?] on us you know my niggas going right back
I hate all of you niggas like Donald Sterling
Charm of a prince my [?] virgin
Luggage for a trip my bitch packed five [?]
I need this money now no wait is that urgent
My trap working I'm in the bridge
Talking business with my shooter
Call service had us know we had nine up in uber
I think jail everytime I eat tuna
Roll up each L's [?] sneaks puma
They through my case out december down in Baltimore
Bully in the same jail watch the phones you talking on
My nigga [?] said red bottoms he love walking on
I'm in rush I gotta go you niggas talking long
The east crazy better watch the block you parking on
Lord have mercy if they murk me
Man my heart live on

[Hook: Dave East]
Black constructs with the black hoodie
I cry like a baby when they smash bully
I came up in projects when it's dark
On side nobody talking it ain't save around here
