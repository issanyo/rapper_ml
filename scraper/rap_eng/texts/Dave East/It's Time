[Intro]
Time to get paid
I want the money
I gotta get guap

[Hook]
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid

[Verse 1]
I'm fresh off the block, this money keep calling
I be up til the morning, this shit never stop
I hit me a lick, went straight to the Bendo
It's lit like a candle, let you and your man know
I got it for cheap, come cop what you want
The coppers be on us, I don't know what they want
We just tryna eat to get out the streets
They calling me back, I'm just tryna leave
I come from the bottom, putting that work in the bottle
I fucked me a model, she just asked me for a follow
I hop a truck, it's either the Range or the Tahoe
I do not give a fuck, she love me enough
She gon' swallow, she gon' swallow

[Hook]
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid

[Verse 2]
I talk what I live, I handle my biz'
I come from the projects, get shot by a kid
We rolling around with pistols and ganja
When I fuck up some paper, I just listen to commas
I can cook it front of you, this shit Benihana Hannas
Sell a nick to your momma, got a clip for the drama
I pull up and park it, I tinted the whip
Go get me some backwoods then I take a trip
I'm living the life, these niggas would not understand
Call me what you want, can't call me broke, started out moving grams
I wake up and hustle, I got no time for fronting
Ain't taking no handouts, I don't owe you niggas nothing, nothing

[Outro]
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid
I gotta get guap, I gotta get cake
I gotta get paper, gotta get money
Time to get paid
