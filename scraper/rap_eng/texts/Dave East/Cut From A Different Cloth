[Intro: Styles P (Dave East)]
New York City and New York gritty
They was lyin' if they told you that New York pretty (lied)
Better stay up on your hustle, stay New York witty (hustle)
Forever, make a move, though New York with me
Vinny Idol, nigga
Yeah, New York City and New York gritty (Ghost)
They was lyin' if they told you that New York pretty (East)
Better stay up on your hustle, stay New York witty (stay New York)
Forever, make a move, though New York with me (I know)

[Chorus: Dave East & Styles P]
Yeah, more paper than I can count (more)
New York get hot, go down south, start with an ounce (we out)
Cut from a different cloth, it ain't no calmin' me down (no)
No need for no introduction 'cause we the hardest in town, uh
More paper than I can count (more)
New York get hot, go down south, start with an ounce (we out)
Cut from a different cloth, it ain't no calmin' me down (no)
No need for no introduction 'cause we the hardest in town, uh

[Verse 1: Dave East]
The ones ain't got shit to talk about always speak the most
It's East and Ghost, a brick of coke and a key of dope
Black hoodie jump out that sprinter and you could see the smoke
They don't check the artists it's on me, right underneath my coat
Suspended license on my way to Yonkers, speedin'
Scared to sleep, every time I close my eyes, I see a demon
I don't know 'bout you but we used to rob niggas for no reason
Before I got famous, you feel a way, then come get even, I'm wreakin'
Old or illegal, got dope for your needles, that Sugar Hill bag
Sold to your auntie, shit make me feel bad
Couldn't get them Jordans to go to school, shit made me real mad
Signed to Def Jam talkin' pounds and I probably still grab
You know what's up, the pistol black and the coke is cut
This ain't a beanie, its a ski mask, I just rolled it up
Champagne interior, Moët colored the Rover guts
Now I'm on College drinkin' D'USSÉ out a coconut

[Chorus: Dave East & Styles P]
More paper than I can count (more)
New York get hot, go down south, start with an ounce (we out)
Cut from a different cloth, it ain't no calmin' me down (no)
No need for no introduction 'cause we the hardest in town, uh
More paper than I can count (more)
New York get hot, go down south, start with an ounce (we out)
Cut from a different cloth, it ain't no calmin' me down (no)
No need for no introduction 'cause we the hardest in town, uh

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Close to the edge, got that forty five close to your head
You talkin' shit but you ain't never spoke to the dead
I like to chill and get wealthy, just smoke 'til I'm red
You heard they gangsters, heard them niggas spoke to the Feds
But I ain't see the paperwork, I keep it quiet 'cause you know how the hater works
It's Dark Force Vader work
Choke a nigga way across the room, that's the way to work
Starin' at the picture, seen the picture move
Jumped in the picture, can you picture how I get to you?
Told East, we could touch the book, make the scripture move
Told East, we could touch a killer, make a pistol move
Ghost is still provin' shit, I ain't got shit to prove
I could see the money play, send my shit in large bills
Know it as the Devil's game, understand it's God's field
Every now and then, I just wonder how God feel
You the card dealer, you should know how the cards feel
Ghost, nigga

[Chorus: Dave East & Styles P]
More paper than I can count (more)
New York get hot, go down south, start with an ounce (we out)
Cut from a different cloth, it ain't no calmin' me down (no)
No need for no introduction 'cause we the hardest in town, uh
More paper than I can count (more)
New York get hot, go down south, start with an ounce (we out)
Cut from a different cloth, it ain't no calmin' me down (no)
No need for no introduction 'cause we the hardest in town, uh
