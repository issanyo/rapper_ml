[Hook:]
Winners never lose, losers never win, I'm just tryin to ball
Catch me in the coupe, blowin in the wind, pull up at the mall
Give it all i got, like I'm in the game, I just want it all
It ain't hard to see, when you look at me, you're looking at a star

[Verse:]
I put it all on the line
I give it all to my grind
Now they just fallin' in line
They try to throw shade, but don't bother my shine
I'm just tryin' to win
Got me a check and I'm just tryin' to spend
I did the train, so I'm just tryin' the Benz
Back to back champion, winnin' again
I feel like Peyton or Kobe, Jordan or Emmitt
Imma push it to the limit
Can't see who's driving this [?]
Imma keep winning
That got you slightly offended
They say pain does make perfect
I'm from the bottom, I feel I deserve it
Venus, Serena, I'm servin' movin' so urgent
While they be sleeping, I'm workin'
Let's take it back to the basics
Gotta have patience, got to much talent to waste it
I have been focused on putting myself in position
This money I chase it
And I really believe it [?] Jadakiss said we gonna make it
You just coming for everything
They don't give it to us, we gonna take it

[Hook:]
Winners never lose, losers never win, I'm just tryin to ball
