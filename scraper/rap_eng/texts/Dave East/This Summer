[Intro: Dave East]
Taylor on the beat
Real niggas stand up
It's holiday season, bitch
Whole water, you get jammed up (forever mean mugga, word)

[Verse 1: Dave East & D. Jones]
I'm the reason you think you got a chance
Broad daylight, aim at his face, so he ain't got a chance
They strippers, they gotta dance
We gangsters we gotta move, we run us, you gotta lose
Making sure you never disrespect, only point to prove
Georgetown inspired me, painted the foreign Hoya blue
Fuck police, I say what I want, I got a lawyer too
Stash in the Bentley, I'm hood, still riding filthy
I told them I could walk on water, oh, god forgive me
If you got a plan to rob me, hope you got a plan to kill me
Bitch this Crip plus I've been sick, ain't doctor can heal me
Came up with all the hustlers, mastered how to chef
Gettin' head in a foreign, gotta steer with the left
Met this forty off with my right, package be here by the morning
We ordered that shit tonight, flight to Florida to get some white
Just send it, I get it, break it down and feed the set
Don't be partying with guala, just sent it and get the jet

[Chorus: Dave East]
Talking shit on the 'Gram, they see you and they quiet
He was fat 'till he got shot, now I ask if he on a diet
If they don't let us in the building, we gon' start a fucking riot
I got niggas that sold a lot of coke but they ain't never tried it
Talking shit on the 'Gram, they see you and they quiet
He was fat 'till he got shot, now I ask if he on a diet
If they don't let us in the building, we gon' start a fucking riot
I got niggas that sold a lot of coke but they ain't never tried it

[Verse 2: D. Jones & Dave East]
I'm the shit that you made up, on the first, gave 'em no cut
That bring the fiends back all month, teach your class if y'all want
A professor with grams, you die, you next to your mans
Really invested in scams, garlic with devilish plans
Garlic noodles and lobsters, somewhere planning to hit
When you come from the dirt, a clean getaway is the shit
Salmons and scallops, breaking down pounds at the palace
Grown women ready to fuck, don't want you around if you childish
Dripping in jewels from jewelers that don't talk to the broke
Crib big now, homie get you drowned in a moat
My daughter got her own pool, I'm giving out swimming lessons
How we living, my kid ain't stressing, violating these Smith-N-Wessons

[Chorus: Dave East]
Talking shit on the 'Gram, they see you and they quiet
He was fat 'till he got shot, now I ask if he on a diet
If they don't let us in the building, we gon' start a fucking riot
I got niggas that sold a lot of coke but they ain't never tried it
Talking shit on the 'Gram, they see you and they quiet
He was fat 'till he got shot, now I ask if he on a diet
If they don't let us in the building, we gon' start a fucking riot
I got niggas that sold a lot of coke but they ain't never tried it

[Outro: D. Jones]
Nah, that's that north-side of Philly, east-side of Harlem shit right there
That's the difference between us and y'all
That's the difference between hustlers and customers
You feel me?
Yeah
Alright, cool
