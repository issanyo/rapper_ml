[Verse 1: Sam Black]
Somebody tell Drake and Kendrick I need a minute
He pimp a butterfly from my view but don't get offended
To Ross I need a deal
To Wayne I need a pill
To Puff I need a hearse with BIG behind the wheel
Hold on I'm going nut again, flowing coming in
You saying your struggles like me voting Republican
I can't see if your mommy, dad they had a job
I come from the gutter, my momma dad not had a lot
I come from Jersey [?]
You miss your target, spin back but it hit the [?]
Granny told me push the dial, keep my face to lord
Man, it's like I really tried but he duck my calls
The game full of these melonies and these dreadheads
[?] thugs killing my headrest
Sprite, [?] starting my deathlist
Put a couple of you lame rappers on bedrest

Name ring bells like 12 on New Year's
Bag insecure, nah I'm riding through that
Philly girl from they [?] ooki
Bundles in my hair that's the only thing's fake about me
Going for a minute but they still [?] rave about me
Everything solid with ain't nothing shaky 'bout me

Waken up, clocking on roaches
Man, I was broke and poor
I never woke up to nice like get out
