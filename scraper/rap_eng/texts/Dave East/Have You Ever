[Verse 1]
I never follow orders put that on my daughter
Back and forth to Florida hide the coke in goya
Pistol on my dresser bitch I'm from the border
Reef Buck my brother, Big Bay my brother
Really know I got â€˜em, Druggy know I really love 'em
All this forever love, mix around the headshot
This Crip I was never Blood, I'm just speaking facts
Papi told me work knowing that I'ma bring it back
Codeine gives me cold sweats
I had to tell my pops that he ain't old yet
Percocets get in me, I got no stress
Dancing with the devil bitch I'm Milly Rocking
Freaky down in Philly its crazy now I got Philly rocking
My youngin' trapping in Brooklyn, that nigga stealing Thompkins
Ponzi scheming like them Wall Street crackers that got it
Immaculate profits that mean that paper God bless
I talked to Scrappy just knowing he walk the yard stressed
Them park sets had my back bigger
Know that you a target, you a black nigga
Used to homicide so we react quicker
We ain't have a dollar on us but we had liquor
Drunk in the projects that was me, go ask niggas

[Chorus]
Never seen a million but I've seen a body
You ain't never served a fiend, ain't never seen a lobby
Mafia thoughts, wish I could speak to Gotti
Stash tucked from my daughter in case them people found me
Never seen a million but I've seen a body
You ain't never served a fiend, ain't never seen a lobby
You got the key to the city? Well shit I need a copy
Rap slow, half Spanish, I could go speak to Papi

[Verse 2]
I hid my pistol in my sock drawer
Everybody hard, we had the hard and you could cop soft
For some reason I don't feel nothing when they knock a cop off
You ain't the only one getting money I got these drop offs
Just thinking back to when i hardly was out
And Baltimore you got it cheap so we target the South
Had dime bags on me walking past LaGuardia Houses
They killed my cousin fuck we talking about? Forever beef
Ain't no truce here
My aunt used to tell me why she ain't move there
Every year the same in the projects like what is New Years?
Drano came home, same nigga they gave him two years
Crazy or forever, always keep a pair of blue Air's
That first night in prison is the worst
Made it worse was coming home and seeing my niggas on the a shirt
Had to get it out the mud, I got respect for the dirt
Thinking how newer fiends would get their checks on the 1st
Sixty thousand in diamonds they like, "His neck gotta hurt"
Know my paps did dirt for that in life I'm probably cursed
Me and my daughter mother realized it never worked
I got sick of the same jeans, I just wanted a better shirt
Wanted some better shoes, can't tell me I never worked

[Chorus]
Never seen a million but I've seen a body
You ain't never served a fiend, ain't never seen a lobby
Mafia thoughts, wish I could speak to Gotti
Stash tucked from my daughter in case them people found me
Never seen a million but I've seen a body
You ain't never served a fiend, ain't never seen a lobby
You got the key to the city? Well shit I need a copy
Rap slow, half Spanish, I could go speak to Papi
