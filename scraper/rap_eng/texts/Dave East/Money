[Verse 1]
I'm from the border
I was born to go get it
Soon as I got locked up, I came home and got that (money)
From the trap spot to Saks Fifth
Mac clip will make these niggas back flip
All over that (money)
If it ain't paper
It ain't no conversation
No time for waiting, what's the combination?
I need that (money)
Paranoia will make your heart stop
I hit your bitch right after a bark shot
She asked me for some (money)
I used to bag reggie up on the regular
Way before cellular, pay phone making calls for that "money"
Givenchy jackets, but the sneakers Fendi
The east is in me
For weed and Remy, my youngin'(s) need that "money"
The block open cause they don't stop smoking
We need I.D. if we do not know 'em
They know I get "money"
Harlem made me, that's all I ever saw
I can tell just how you talkin', that you ain't ever saw
(I got that money)
Fresh out the bank, smellin' like Tom Ford
Colorful diamonds reminding of the (?) (?)
My momma work for that, they hit the pole and twerk for that
Excuses for a Birkin bag, she take him for (money)
Making Manhattan, that's where we used to fashion
F.D.R. swervin'
Was servin' a copper coupe' and crashin' "money"
All I ever wanted to get, now the presidential lookin' like 1996
Old "money"
Them blue faces got me too racist, only thinking Benjamins'
50 niggas getting in, we got "money"
Tried to be humble, but the paper got me
Mami screamin'
"Hey Papi" like Hova gettin' Roc-A- Fella (money)
Prince of the city
I'm feeling like Biggie
When Diddy first gave him that Bad Boy (money)
100 Hummers like Manny and Baby
Since a Juvie, I knew I was Hot Boyz
Shout out to Cash (Money)

[Chorus]
The reason these bitches dancin'
Reason these niggas gamblin'
Reason these niggas scramblin' (money)
Tell me what you think we grind for
Trying to give our mom more, just trying to get our shine on
Or make the little homies run up on you
You gettin' paper, I just pray you keep a gun up on you
The reason my niggas trap
The reason my niggas clap
The reason my niggas rap for that (echoes 5x)
(money)

[Verse 2]
Making fiends break dance, used to having to shake hands
That's how we used play grams
Hand-to-hand for that (money)
As-salam alaykum, don't be round no bacon
I kindly waited, now every promoter givin' me that (money)
I did the (?)
And went and got brick
Lobster's, scallops and crabs from Alaska
Where they got (?) that (money)
Give you power like the loaded weapon
I'm never stoppin, they hatin' cause they got no progression
Had me trying go the NBA route
(?) lighthouse for takeout, that's short (money)
Every night I gotta curve your wife
They tellin' me I'm the Future, and I don't do the dirty Sprite
(I got the money)
A couple years ago, I went the scammer route
Hammers out, in front your grandma house
Nigga where my (money)
That extra talkin', lead to extra coffins
The definition of extortion, somebody taking (money)
Im in a drop, AC on blast
Feelin' like Pac when Suge gave him that Death Row (money)
I'm feeling like Jeezy when Trap or Die dropped
Free Big Meech, that nigga got the (money)

[Chorus]
The reason these bitches dancin'
Reason these niggas gamblin'
Reason these niggas scramblin' (money)
Tell me what you think we grind for
Trying to give our mom more, just trying to get our shine on
Or make the little homies run up on you
You gettin' paper, I just pray you keep a gun up on you
The reason my niggas trap
The reason my niggas clap
The reason my niggas rap for that (echoes 5x)
(money)
