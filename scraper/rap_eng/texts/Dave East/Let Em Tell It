[Intro]
Yeah you know every time me and DJ Paul get together
Ain't nothin' but big business
Shouts to my new spot, triple W dime shop, scream.com

[Pre-Hook: Dave East]
I got the OG and I got the molly
(No you don't, no you don't)
I got these bitches all over my body
(No you don't, no you don't)
We got that money, you know that we got it
(No you don't, no you don't)
I got a Bentley, I got a Bugatti
(No you don't, no you don't)

[Hook: DJ Paul]
These niggas ain't built like they say they is
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even been 100)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even gettin' money)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't out here stuntin')
These niggas ain't built like they say they is
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even been 100)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even gettin' money)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't out here stuntin')

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Nigga know he ain't got it, nigga know he ain't got it
But he lovin' rappin' bout it, but he love rappin' bout it
Every line he be lyin', every line he be lyin'
Better listen to the rhymes, pay attention to the rhymes
Nigga got Porsches, nigga got a bitch
Nigga sold dope on the porch with a friend
Then said that he had keys and the keys don't (?)
Snitched on the same friend just to keep from goin' in
You an Abraham nigga, not a Benjamin
You say you keep it 100? While you keep it then
You ain't got them bands, you ain't got no friends
I'm just lyin' here wonderin' when your lies gon' end
When they get you in the corner and they find out you ain't nothin' but a loner
Got your hands out everyday on the corner steady tryna get a loaner
Everybody know that ain't your whip, you be whippin' nigga that there is a loaner
Funny ass, boney ass nigga ain't even tryna come up ain't got a hustle in his bones

[Hook: DJ Paul]
These niggas ain't built like they say they is
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even been 100)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even gettin' money)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't out here stuntin')
These niggas ain't built like they say they is
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even been 100)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even gettin' money)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't out here stuntin')

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I can see these niggas ain't 100
I can see these niggas out here frontin'
They ain't got no money
Used to see me pull up in that bucket
Got it on me right now but I tucked it
Niggas ain't cut from the same cloth
No time for no worker, I'm the same boss
OG to the face but I ain't cough
Pop a perc, blow a zip 'fore I take off
Breakin' down a three six, knockin' Three 6
Prolly pull up in a foreign with like three chicks
Said you had that work on you, you had three nicks
Fuck is that? Ever take from a real nigga
You want it back

[Hook: DJ Paul]
These niggas ain't built like they say they is
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even been 100)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even gettin' money)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't out here stuntin')
These niggas ain't built like they say they is
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even been 100)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even gettin' money)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't out here stuntin')

[Verse 3: Dave East]
These niggas ain't never sold cocaine
These niggas know nothin' bout the dope game
From the haze to the sour, watch the smoke chain
Three choppers in the trunk, I'm in the slow lane
Fanta or the Sprite with the lean in it
I'm in the kitchen with the pot, watch me lean with it
Rock with it, let the whole block get it
They just talkin' bout that money, they do not get it
Dead broke talkin' how the feds watch
Red dot, arms around your head, head lock
I was broke long enough, somethin' gotta give
Talkin' tough, still livin' in your mama crib

[Hook: DJ Paul]
These niggas ain't built like they say they is
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even been 100)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even gettin' money)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't out here stuntin')
These niggas ain't built like they say they is
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even been 100)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't even gettin' money)
Like they say they is (niggas ain't out here stuntin')
