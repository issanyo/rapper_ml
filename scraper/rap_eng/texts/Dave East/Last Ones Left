[Intro]
Real niggas
Real niggas
Real niggas

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Shout to Pun on Fetty block, my youngin's fetti chasin'
FDR North, no license but I got registration
Every Jordan months before they drop, I ain't ever waitin'
Fuck the government and motherfuck board of education
Never taught me nothing, but the block did
Goyard bags under both eyelids, give a fuck 'bout your stylist
Laid up in the palace, knocking Khaled eating salad
Money, sex, drugs, and violence
Hit the ave to keep my balance
I was in the hills of Beverly
Hermes accessories
Allergic to that jealousy
22 caught my felony
Mami with me swallowed the gar
I had to Ferragamo her bra
No arguments, we followin' cars
Not a nigga alive
Ever violate and just slide
I've been stabbed and grazed
Better aim, I might have died
30,000 dollars in bundles
Rock Bape in the jungle
Ma$e called me and told me rumble
Harlem, fuck bein' humble
Be buildin' in-front the circle
They say patience a virtue
Nick strong, my boy a soldier
Know the streets'll desert you
I'm in the rain, Christian Louboutins, watchin' for puddles
My circles small as a dime, perfect fit for that puzzle
Talk it, I live it
The plug just sent the powder to (?)
Remember eatin' off them fuckin' trays mindin' my business
I'm in the field for real, ain't never got no time for no gimmicks
Eddie Kendricks playin', he died before he got through his sentence

[Hook: Dave East]
The plug just sent the powder to (?)
Remember eatin' off them fuckin' trays mindin' my business
The plug just sent the powder to (?)
Remember eatin' off them fuckin' trays mindin' my business

[Verse 2: Don Q]
I used to pull up in the Honda but now it's a drop big
I'm window shoppin' when I buy tints
I ran out the store and been hot since
I pour up the four on the block bench
I had to get low when the cops spin
I was trapped in the trap I was locked in
That XXL I am the top 10
I can smoke that from the sky
These young niggas killin' and they ready to die
Wish you could tell that I'm high
All this red in my eye, my wrist and my neck is a pie
Never knew where we was headed
Talkin' back when I was (?) headed
Thinkin' T's with graffiti letters
Now diamonds dancin' where Jesus head is
Ups and downs, I was keepin' leverage
I hope I live enough to see my blessings
She DM a message, I ain't even check it
(?) hard get an E for effort
Give a fuck what the drugs cost
We try and knock a nigga plug off
Plain 30 take the gloves off
All business, no love off
Pineapple Fanta my favorite
Especially when I got that drank in it
Two liter with an eighth in it
Two seater and I'm racin' it
Might take out the 'Rari for Christmas
(?) my (?) relentless
I had to bump in my mistress
I had to Cartier my lenses
Wait let's keep it 100
I'm fly as a bitch when you see me in public
My pieces is fly
Come in the house and my heat was the oven
Sold my first ounce but the whip was nothin'
Pretty hoes give me the puss
I make her clean through the dishes and cook
My shooter the drop, make him sit and just look
Outside of your house with a stick in a bush
I remember I ain't had shit
I was down on my last cent
All I know is keep the bag zipped
Hit the ave for a fast food
Niggas saw me, lot of ice on me
Turnin' up like it's (?)
Heat the baggage up, right on it
On God put my life on it

[Hook: Don Q]
Niggas saw me, lot of ice on me
Turnin' up like it's (?)
Heat the baggage up, right on it
On God put my life on it
Niggas saw me, lot of ice on me
Turnin' up like it's (?)
Heat the baggage up, right on it
On God put my life on it

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Jump in the Wraith
I'm makin' love in the court
My lawyer just fuckin' the case
I'm smokin' dope on 108th
Momma come home, put them others away
Ain't so tough with a gun in your face
No time to waste I got 100s to make
OG and gas, that's a wonderful taste
Bet when I die I be one of the greats
I be with felons with coke
They even jealous of bro
Niggas'll tell 'em they broke
I've been through shit I never can show
I'm in this bitch like Flex in the '90s
You ain't designer, my niggas is grimy
Weavin' through traffic, got hitters behind me
Sneakers is Gucci, jeans Givenchy

[Verse 4: Don Q]
Tell my chauffeur come drive me
Bird off on (?)
Louis T for a 90
These 4 chains cost 90
Pro at the game, come sign me
Brand new Porsche ridin'
Hop out, ghost ridin'
We get that work and we export it
I ain't ever been extorted
My bitch full of numbers, you (?)
(?) the next Floyd
I kick her out if the sex boring
Then it's on to the next horn
Next city gettin' checks for it
When you say my name put respek on it

[Hook: Don Q]
Then it's on to the next horn
Next city gettin' checks for it
When you say my name put respek on it
Then it's on to the next horn
Next city gettin' checks for it
When you say my name put respek on it

[Hook: Dave East]
Weavin' through traffic, got hitters behind me
Sneakers is Gucci, jeans Givenchy
Weavin' through traffic, got hitters behind me
