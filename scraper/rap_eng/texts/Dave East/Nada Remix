[Chorus: Emilio Rojas]
My mama worked double shifts, she had three jobs
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta go and hustle quick, I gotta be somethin'
(I ain’t never had nada)
I’m livin' uptown, I stay by that weed spot
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta upgrade to J’s from them Reeboks, brrrrr
(I ain’t never had nada)
My mama worked double shifts, she had three jobs
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta go and hustle quick, I gotta be somethin'
(I ain’t never had nada)
I’m livin' uptown, I stay by that weed spot
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta upgrade to J’s from them Reeboks, brrrrr
(I ain’t never had nada)

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Damn, I gotta get it, damn, I gotta get it
I was runnin’ from my ghost and now a phantom what I sit in
Needed money on the floor, I give a damn about opinion
I’mma give my mama home because my daddy never did it, nah
It was nine of us inside a two bedroom, one bathroom
It had a coop head room, we was steppin’ over people just to piss
My parents and abuela and my tios and they kids, yeah
Officers are knockin’ on the door
Neighbors hit the cops when he knock her on the floor
The mothafucka vanished, not a dollar for support
Then he jetted to Caracas to get out of hittin’ court, ah
Stand up, I did it on my own two
Why your hands out bitch? I don’t know you
Suvi denim with the rips when I stroll through
Uptown, six seven with the whole crew
Yeah, tell twin put her Mazi up
I’m with Dominican women that got they body done
I see myself, I don’t recognize who I become
‘Cause all the drama I’m livin’ would never got me none
The block lit November to October
The old heads sip, I never seen y’all sober
Dope fiends lean but they never fall over
Them hoes all fuck you with so they walk over

[Chorus: Emilio Rojas]
My mama worked double shifts, she had three jobs
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta go and hustle quick, I gotta be somethin'
(I ain’t never had nada)
I’m livin' uptown, I stay by that weed spot
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta upgrade to J’s from them Reeboks, brrrrr
(I ain’t never had nada)
My mama worked double shifts, she had three jobs
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta go and hustle quick, I gotta be somethin'
(I ain’t never had nada)
I’m livin' uptown, I stay by that weed spot
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta upgrade to J’s from them Reeboks, brrrrr
(I ain’t never had nada)

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Started with a holster and a clip
Now I’m signin’ posters for your bitch
Tryna take a trip, I just want a rover with the tints
Model bitches showin’ me they tits
Focused on a brick, I was 19 on the payroll
Choppa make ‘em move when I say so, brrrrr
Stormin’ so I got a Gucci ring, cold
We ain’t ‘bout no problems, get ya brain blown
All my life, seen my mama work two jobs
Too fire with a nine, nigga woosah
Calm down, four pound make ‘em moonwalk
Or we can catch him with his bitch and hit his moomah
Louis denim on, tuck the ruger
Meek Mill Pumas gettin’ too high
I’mma eastside nigga, let a few fly
All eyes on East, I feel like 2Pac
Pull up in a new drop, we ain’t never had shit
Ain’t nobody tryna box, niggas blastin’
I’mma savage, shooter like the mavericks
It could get tragic, mama fit him for a casket
I don’t know nobody tryin’ East
Every time I tried to eat, we was eatin’ Chinese
Tryna hit some wings, talkin’ about a nine piece
I ain’t never had nothin’, it was a conflict of onion

[Chorus: Emilio Rojas]
My mama worked double shifts, she had three jobs
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta go and hustle quick, I gotta be somethin'
(I ain’t never had nada)
I’m livin' uptown, I stay by that weed spot
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta upgrade to J’s from them Reeboks, brrrrr
(I ain’t never had nada)
My mama worked double shifts, she had three jobs
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta go and hustle quick, I gotta be somethin'
(I ain’t never had nada)
I’m livin' uptown, I stay by that weed spot
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta upgrade to J’s from them Reeboks, brrrrr
(I ain’t never had nada)

[Outro]
My mama was single, my father, he left us with nada
Not even a dollar for diapers so she doubled her hospital shifts
Just to give us a quality life, uh, now I’m chasin' this money
I’m sick and tired of askin' what the price is
And I’mma need me a couple of millions for my sacrifices
