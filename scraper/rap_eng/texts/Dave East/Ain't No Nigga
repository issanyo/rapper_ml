[Verse 1: Dave East]
I'm never checking for the next chick
No need
For me to ever get domestic
I be
Smoking trees up in the West End
We breeze
96 street be the exit
BG
She know the gang I'm in all blue
Just left my jeweler
I send an Uber she fall through
Never quiet when I'm in it she like to talk too
Chanelle bags that's light it cost me a walkthrough
No lie
You get the keys to the Rover
But no drive
And 30 niggas in my section with weapons but don't mind
If he ain't hot then he ain't hot
I'm cosigned with chains on
I gotta hit it from the back, I might blind her shit
They say sex is a weapon
I'm OJ Simpson, after I kill it Imma beat any question
From the projects to the mansion life
Louie leather shit, full advance tonight
I'm in the pants tonight

[Hook]
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)

[Verse 2: Ms. Hustle]
What up boo just keep me laced in the illest snakes
I call him Diamond, he got killer taste
And he'll put a nigga in his place
I call it real estate
Aw man I can feel the hate, feel the hate
You see them OT trips, he called me up
Yup he know I'm G'ed up
Some G's for the re-up
Them hoes can't keep up
Yup he throw them C's up
I keep a bloody shoe
You can tell when my feet up
Yup I'm the reason he called back
I just copped 'em
Off white and all black
Some other shit I can't pronounce
I'm like what they call that
The middle of September
Yah I tell them hoes fall back
I'm off that
This trendy mama with the slant eyes
Them other niggas yeah they fantasize
He know I handle mines
And if we get pulled the hammer mines
And he ain't gotta second guess he know I'm here to ride

[Hook]
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)

[Verse 3: Dave East & (Ms. Hustle)]
Her friend DM'ed me like I got a thing for profit
She ain't even know I got a thing for chocolate
I'm just one of them niggas she never telling stop it
Been with this freak all week, been held hostage
(Yo pop what's poppin')
Naw mami what's crackin'
Where you from, Manhattan
Harlem to be exact
I been across the globe just laying the money back
Like after they get a taste they just ain't know how to act
(?)
(Winter time I need Chinchilla)
(First class flights and chef right at the villa)
(It ain't hard to tell you ain't a regular nigga)
My man asking about that ass, its heavy my nigga
(You better not be playing you tell me get ready nigga)
I'm not just every nigga, that's why I be barely with her

[Hook]
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
Man of their own, man of their own)

Tell them freaks to find a man of their own
