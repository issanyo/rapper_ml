(Intro)
I was the nigga that they hated on, now I’m that nigga that they waiting on
In the kitchen with a apron on, cooking

(Verse)
I was the nigga that they hated on, now I’m that nigga that they waiting on
In the kitchen with a apron on, I’d front you something but you take too long
Back in the hood with no cable on, DVD’s or the netflix
Air condition dry wet bricks, 80 thousand on my left wrist
I’m from the city with the best spit, remember I wanted a lexus
Got pills coming in from Texas, paranoid without a weapon
I’m the nigga that the hoes love, I won’t let you niggas hold nun
On the kitchen table break a whole hunnid, all these niggas looking at us like we stole something
I’m the sickest nigga breathing, coughing, everyday I feel a cold coming
Young nigga wit a old woman, mob flow got the coast buggin
On the highway I’m road running, I see you niggas getting no money
I’m on the flyer then the hoes coming, I ain going in less the pole coming
Hard papers with a light leaf, honestly ain got no time to speak
How you in the streets but find time to tweet? I ain waiting for it, shit you gotta week
7 days and I’m on you, send my young boy to warn you
I ain got numbers to call you, finessing is something we all do
Now I’m the nigga to talk to, cop a rollie off a walk through
Grabbing on me when I walk through, gotta young bitch in law school
Told her she can be my lawyer, as long as she pass the bar
My new car Aston Martin, I got whatever, cash or card
This for them niggas be acting hard, shoot the nigga in the face
Thats no wake, just memories, forever screaming fuck my enemies
I’m the nigga that they pretend to be, I been that nigga since little league
Could never let you niggas get to me, remember the gang so vividly
Counting these hundreds with painful memories
I don’t got time for the games, Ima get paid, Papa said follow the code
Stay in my lane, niggas be saying I changed, same niggas calling me broke
Stuck on a plane, ima go get it regardless, i cannot ever be broke
I cannot ever be lame, I don’t duck none of the smoke, got hunnids to blow
I don’t got time for the games, Ima get paid, Tymer said follow the code
Stay in my lane, niggas be saying I changed, same niggas calling me broke
Stuck on a plane, ima go get it regardless, i cannot ever be broke
I cannot ever be lame, I don’t duck none of the smoke, got hunnids to blow
