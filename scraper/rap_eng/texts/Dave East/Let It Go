[Chorus]
I make 'em holla "there he go" (there he go)
It ain't the same no more
No more playin', ain't no games no more
I ain't afraid to let it go
I got my own money now
I got my own niggas
What these bitches want from me?
I will never know
It ain't the same no more
No more playin', ain't no games no more
I ain't afraid to let it go
I got my own money now
I got my own niggas
What these bitches want from me?
I will never know

[Bridge]
You can't imagine what it feels like
When I ain't have a dollar on me, I ain't feel right
Now they listen, and they tell me, "boy, you still nice"
Don't get it twisted, cause I'm

[Verse 1]
Cleaned up like a janitor
D's watchin' on camera
Real niggas just won't speak
Stay away from police
Smoke clear and I'm still East
Corporate money, I'm still street
Like boss mob, I still creep
Them plates ready, we still eat
Out chasin' them pesos
Lawyer told me my case closed
Blue steel, nice bankroll
With the ATM if my bank closed
Medusa head where that belt at
Like a earthquake, the streets felt that
Flow fire, beats melt that
Bag up a verse, go sell crack
Came up off hard work
Back stronger, that bar work
I'm OT with a white chick
We could get rich if these cards work
Heart cold, I feel numb
Need M's when that deal come
Past hoes, they feel dumb
Hit two times, just chill once
Four-five, that's flat-line
Trap talk on my back line
Green box that packed nine
I seen everything, I just act blind
Ralph Lauren my logo
Kush smoke, I'm slow-mo
Only chasin' el pollo
Not talkin' gwap is a no-go

[Chorus]
I make 'em holla "there he go" (there he go)
It ain't the same no more
No more playin', ain't no games no more
I ain't afraid to let it go
I got my own money now
I got my own niggas
What these bitches want from me?
I will never know
It ain't the same no more
No more playin', ain't no games no more
I ain't afraid to let it go
I got my own money now
I got my own niggas
What these bitches want from me?
I will never know

[Verse 2]
Custom-fitted shit is tailored
Floatin' like a sailor
Avoidin' a lot of failures
Lay back with Iggy Azalea
There's nothin' I can tell ya
Get some money, if not, you useless
And all you ever gonna have is excuses
Visions of that Panamera, roof translucent
Trips to Saint Lucia, kept a couple grams movin'
Bajan blood, hundred Harlem niggas invade your club
Sippin' champagne in tubs
Gotta go through pain for love
Soprano livin', like Tony and Carmela
Cashmere attire, bottoms was Margiela
Them niggas drinkin' your bottles gon' be your pallbearers
Creatin' all terror, reflection from all mirrors
It's the same
Wouldn't change for a dollar like four quarters
Passport good, I'm moonwalkin' through all borders
Back-court good, couple shooters, that's all water
Preparation is practice, be right when they call for ya

[Chorus]
I make 'em holla "there he go" (there he go)
It ain't the same no more
No more playin', ain't no games no more
I ain't afraid to let it go
I got my own money now
I got my own niggas
What these bitches want from me?
I will never know
It ain't the same no more
No more playin', ain't no games no more
I ain't afraid to let it go
I got my own money now
I got my own niggas
What these bitches want from me?
I will never know
I make 'em holla "there he go" (there he go)
It ain't the same no more
No more playin', ain't no games no more
I ain't afraid to let it go
I got my own money now
I got my own niggas
What these bitches want from me?
I will never know
It ain't the same no more
No more playin', ain't no games no more
I ain't afraid to let it go
I got my own money now
I got my own niggas
What these bitches want from me?
I will never know

[Bridge]
You can't imagine what it feels like
When I ain't have a dollar on me, I ain't feel right
Now they listen, and they tell me, "boy, you still nice"
Don't get it twisted cause I'm spittin'
We could still fight

[Outro]
There he go
There he go
I make 'em holla "there he go"
I ain't afraid to let it go
