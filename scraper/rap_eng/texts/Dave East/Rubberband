[Intro: Dave East]
I gotta keep it a hundred
I gotta keep it a hundred
That's all I gotta do
I gotta keep it a hundred
A hundred

[Hook: Dave East]
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
Come through your window like Bruh-da man
I got G Money, no gutta man
I ain't really trying, nor a nigga lying anytime he stutter man
Outside with the butter grams
Neck and wrist 'bout a hundred grand

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Got me feeling like a wanted man
Got a freak and she don't want a man
Hit the bitch if I want a ten
Gucci sneaks all up in the sand
Better team and a bigger plan
Teterboro, if I wanna land
Tell the pilot I don't wanna land
I did the hooptie, now I want the Lamb
Smoker called me said she want a gram
We not homies, you are not my man
Momma kick it with them pots out
Gunshots clear the block out
If they shooting gotta box out, since they help your mother pick the box out
Broke the 911 Porshe box out
Body full of dope I'ma knock out

[Hook: Dave East]
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
Come through your window like Bruh-da man
I got G Money, no gutta man
I ain't really trying, nor a nigga lying anytime he stutter man
Outside with the butter grams
Neck and wrist 'bout a hundred grand

[Outro: Dave East]
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundred wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
I gotta keep it a hundred
I keep me some hundreds wrapped up in a rubberband
Come through your window like Bruh-da man
I got G Money, no better man
I ain't really trying, nor a nigga lying anytime he stutter man
Outside with the butter grams
Neck and wrist 'bout a hundred grand
