[Intro: G Herbo]
Hey yo East I came all the way to Harlem, look. I figured I'd just go through you, you know what I'm sayin'? We make a little, flip a couple times do us. And you just take me to papi himself, we go with the whole bag and it's just we ain't go home or nothin', you know?

[Hook: Dave East + G Herbo]
They looking for the coke, for the pills, for the molly, for the weed, for the lean
We do it for the set, for the turf, for the block, got a Glock with a beam
They take it too far, really try and be a star, but it's not what it seems
I ain't had a dollar in my pocket, now I count it every night I go to sleep
They looking for the coke, for the pills, for the molly, for the weed, for the lean
We do it for the set, for the turf, for the block, got a Glock with a beam
They take it too far, really try and be a star, but it's not what it seemsI been real paranoid in the streets, every night gotta clutch it in my dreams

[Verse 1: Dave East + G Herbo]
I got bitches on the payroll
Catch a body, gotta lay low
Took over the tri-state
Herbo, I'm lettin' Herb go
The bird flow got me feelin' impatient like "why wait?"
White plate, we could cook out
Dolce and Gabbana when I take a nap
I lost a couple thousand, I'ma make it back
Niggas never been outside, can't relate to that
I was in the coke spot
Makaveli on repeat, startin' to think that I know Pac
Talk a lot, get a throat shot
First Ave catch a 10, when they raid it be so hot
Wake up, sleepin' in the dope spotFiends already lined up soon as the coke drop
I can tell if you gang by the door knock
And when the chain gang rang, flush the whole pot
Break it down all the pans
Baking soda in the kitchen gettin' busy with my mans
Kinda dizzy in this bitch, breathin' wiffles of the tan
Fuck around, catch a high, startin' to stumble where I stand
Hit a couple quarters back, my old shitter had a fumble, dropped a nine, picked a scissor so I lost a couple grams
Couple niggas in the hood got hit up, told my dog this is 'fore he even kill 'em cause they got up on the stand

[Hook: Dave East + G Herbo]
They looking for the coke, for the pills, for the molly, for the weed, for the lean

I been real paranoid in the streets, every night gotta clutch it in my dreams

[Verse 2: Dave East + G Herbo]
I heard la policia was lookin' for your dog
Say I've been totin' artillery and sellin' balls
Well you better not say my name on no phone call
I know them people got my picture on that long wall
Burner on my hip, blunt full of dope
Cause I'm whippin' coke, I ain't dyin' broke
I ain't flyin' coach
Only nigga up in first class -- woah
30 foot of coke
Wrist solid gold, foreign stop and go
Three months on the road 8 to 10 a show
All of it you sold
Cast on my bus down 150 chains before they even did the most
Jackie Chan, I kick it
Foreign shit, I'm in it
Neiman Marcus know I never got a limit
Shootin' out the car, pray to God it's tinted
I ain't had a pot to piss in, shit was wicked

[Hook: Dave East + G Herbo]

[Outro: Dave East]
