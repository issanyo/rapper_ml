[Hook: Jazzy Amra]
Shorty only 19, always on the night scene
He don't know what life means
We need to slow down
Her mama says she drive her crazy
She's just a baby but she's about to have a baby
Slow down
He can't afford it so he wanna rob
He'd rather trap cause he don't want a job
You need to slow down
The world is yours just take your time with it
Get up, go out, and let your grind get it
Slow down

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Times changing, money motivate 'em different now
I don't even see no youngings shovel when it's blizzards now
'96 if I dug like four cars out, I'd cop some Nike kicks
And thinking Chinese chicken, wings, and rice to get
I guess the older heads ain't teaching nothing
I'm burnt out myself so honestly not preaching nothing
But if that trap slow get a job buy some nice shoes
And hit them parties down town where them wild niggas cannot get inside
Start thinking business
Remember money hard to mix with friendships
Once they show your interest, get your chicken
Young, black, and rich they worst nightmare
The government don't fight fair
If your homies love you keep 'em right there
Right there

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Don't be 30 in your mother crib, that's bugged out
Understand success gon' come with hate just get that love out
And don't be influenced just because they pull some drugs out
Stand up on your own two, know certain things you won't do
Everybody not a shooter understand that title
I picked the Quran up, I couldn't understand that Bible
Allah's my witness
I've been through the trenches just like most of them
That's why I go and smoke with them
Shop and crack jokes with them
I'm expecting a kid though, used to watch out the window
I love when the lil homies call me big bro
You living fast, need to slow it down
Started getting ass and got 'em open now
She thought she was in love, her heart broken now
Slow down

[Bridge: Dave East]
Diamonds what the girls love
They just wanna shine
Copped the Rollie and the Cuban chain
Living with his mom
She in the club, her mother baby sit
Daddy not around
Fast living'll catch up quick
You need to slow it down

[Outro]
Hey young world, the world, the world
The world, the world, baby the world
The world, the world
The world is yours
(Slow down, slow down)
