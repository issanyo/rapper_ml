[Intro: Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifa, & Vivica A. Fox]
This money got you trippin'
Now what you gon' do?
Rob another goddamn bank
What the fuck is y'all thinkin'?
Hold up, we said once, Cleo
To get enough change to get us up outta here
And that's all it is, Stoney
We need some real money

[Verse 1]
These niggas can't smoke or can't drink with me (at all)
The realest alive, come and meet with me
I'm in your city, bad bitches gon' link with me (link up)
First class, I don't check bags, I just carry on all this Louis shit (LV)
Get your wife, she on some groupie shit (yeah)
I found me a bad and a boujee bitch (bad)
I jump out the wagon with hooligans
I ask for back but I'm back in the mood again
I dropped out of class, don't need tutorin' (fuck em)
That 600, I'm maneuverin'
Maybach comin' this week (this week)
I need some head 'til I get weak (uh)
GemStar at your wind piece (uh)
Black .40 match the Benz seats (ooh)
I might pull up more than 10 deep (more)
Still got that white, boy, no NSYNC (white)
I throw up my thumbs and I send three
I got the pump in the Benz Jeep (facts)
I leave blood all on your t-shirt (shirt)
These niggas just pussies, they been sweet (I know it)
You wouldn't believe what I been through
Used to bend through on the 10 speed (uh)

[Chorus]
Head of the family, I never talk (never talk)
I'm somewhere gettin' a pedicure (pedicure)
Don't know what to say, I done said it all (said it all)
Rumors about me, I read 'em all (read 'em all)
Pull up in Suburban, she told you that she was a virgin but I got the head and all (head and all)
I got the pussy, ain't never call (never call)
Run in the bank and I set it off (set it off)
Head of the family, I never talk (never talk)
I'm somewhere gettin' a pedicure (pedicure)
Don't know what to say, I done said it all (said it all)
Rumors about me, I read 'em all (read 'em all)
Pull up in Suburban, she told you that she was a virgin but I got the head and all (head and all)
I got the pussy, ain't never call (never call)
Run in the bank and I set it off (set it off)

[Verse 2]
I'm somewhere gettin' a manicure
Reach for my chain and I'm lettin' this hammer off
.40 on me, they don't check the artist
Harlem crippin', I'ma rep regardless
We lookin' for you and your man and the way we gon' throw it at him, he an extra target
I ain't into all that extra talkin' (nah)
He ridin' with you, then the TEC'll park him
I let a hollow go right in his face then walk by him like I never saw him
The price stay, we don't ever bargain (never)
Investin' right, I'ma stress the market
They talk like they gangsta but never walk it
If twelve niggas front, that's eleven coffins (eleven)
I throw 'em thirty and head to Boston (thirty)
That here a .30, you better toss 'em (throw that)
I flip the patty like, "Oh God" (patty)
Fillin' up baggies, my old job (old job)
They dope boys and now they goin' up (up)
I ain't had nothin', I'm gon' rob (rob)
I can't relate to these soft niggas (I can't)
My OG just told me, "Just go hard"
I don't give a fuck 'bout who hatin'
I'm on vacation, I send 'em a postcard
Me and my daughter be matchin' (matchin')
Came up on the corner, I'm trappin' (trap)
Don't fuck with this shit, y'all be jackin' (jack)
I'm from the trenches, you cannot imagine
I ride with my Ruger, I got me a cougar and she look just like Toni Braxton
Shark face, that's an Aston, .45 got me saggin'

[Chorus]
Head of the family, I never talk (never talk)
I'm somewhere gettin' a pedicure (pedicure)
Don't know what to say, I done said it all (said it all)
Rumors about me, I read 'em all (read 'em all)
Pull up in Suburban, she told me that she was a virgin but I got the head and all (head and all)
I got the pussy, ain't never call (never call)
Run in the bank and I set it off (set it off)
Head of the family, I never talk (never talk)
I'm somewhere gettin' a pedicure (pedicure)
Don't know what to say, I done said it all (said it all)
Rumors about me, I read 'em all (read 'em all)
Pull up in Suburban, she told you that she was a virgin but I got the head and all (head and all)
I got the pussy, ain't never call (never call)
Run in the bank and I set it off (set it off)

[Outro: Queen Latifa]
I want some more motherfuckin' money
