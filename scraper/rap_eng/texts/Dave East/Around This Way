[Verse 1: AD]
I be on the grind round this way
Trying to survive, most die round this way
Hoes lie around this way
Foes gone, doing time around this way
Keep it real with your mans around this way
Same friend, take a stand round this way
Now everybody want to claim round this way
But nobody want to stay round this way
See it’s really no love round this way
Want a drug, got a plug round this way
Say you want to thug round this way
But you don’t want to see the judge round this way
I be posted on the block round this way
Fuck a job niggas flock round this way
Getting money, don’t floss round this way
Cause it comes with a cost round this way

[Chorus: AD]
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Around my way, a couple bodies found around my way
East side, Spanish Harlem, come around my way
Got coke, dope, enola pounds around my way
Give a nigga the beats, they don’t sound like Dre
In the staircase, we still trap around my way
Ransom money, bodies lost, found around my way
In the kitchen, pack the baking soda around that yay
This east nigga, not west, I don’t sound like Ye
Around my way, pitch it off the mound, not play
Rounds I spray, forever underground they lay
My nigga AD, BBS’s on it like the 80’s
VVS’s shining, we gon line up, tryna play neat
I come from the projects where the gram sell cheaper
Chirping, moving dimes off a [?] speaker
Cousin had the coke, my connect had the reefer
Better play the front of the building, and back they’ll leave ya

[Chorus: AD]
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way

[Verse 3: Icewear Vezzo]
Nigga we be selling 'caine round this way
40 pointers in the chain round this way
Niggas ain’t about them games round this way
We’ll leave a pussy nigga’s brains on this plate
I’m the motherfucking king round this way
Syrup gang, that’s the team round this way
Whole city getting cheese round this way
Turn the club to a murder scene when them clips spray
Niggas know about the zone, don’t fly here
Don’t be the first rap nigga that’ll die here
All the real trap niggas doing time here
Get the whole club packed if I’m there
Nigga ask about me I’m the drank man
I’ll leave you painted on like a spray can
Got a buck 19 in the waistband
We don’t do the yeet, bitch we do the break dance

[Chorus: AD]
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way, around this way, around this way
Around this way
