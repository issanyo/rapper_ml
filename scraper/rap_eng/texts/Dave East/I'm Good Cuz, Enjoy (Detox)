[Intro: Michael Wright, John Terrell, Dave East]
My style, nigga, even tryna riff like me
Aye, man, why do you get your boy outta here and detox him
You want my spot, Flash? Hm?
Slum dwellin', scum suckin', slug ass mo'fucker
You want my spot, Flash!? Huh?
Well you ain't gon get it!
'Cause you ain't got it
You? You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style
(I wanna be him)
I know
Harlem

[Verse]
I guess niggas wanna be famous, that shit cool with me
I'm what they aspire to be, shit they mood is me
That Instagram chattin' ain't really movin' me
You mad at yourself, that shit ain't got nothin' to do with me
Damn, homie, couple years ago it looked like you would be the man, homie
What the fuck happened to you? Your origins don't attract bread
You one gram away from being a crackhead
Your shit got quiet, you had to act dead
Dick eater, ball grabber
You wanted to be me since wet met, you just a tall rapper (dat all)
None of them kids around your way even look up to you (none)
You just seen me, show me love, that's the shit suckers do (sucker)
How you let the moves that I'm makin' really hurt your life?
Know you don't like me, when you see me you give me merchandise?
I threw that bum ass hat out on the Bruckner (on God)
Japan trash and you ain't even nicer than your brother (no)
All them niggas in your comments pussy, they wanted verses
If they don't rap, they don't even matter, them niggas worthless (who are they)
I'm the reason you thinkin' you could be relevant
That shit you sniffin', you should be sellin' it, thought you'd never switch
Before this Gucci, you knew me for straight hoodies
How you from the Bronx and can't get a feature from A Boogie?
That's word to Tookie, this Harlem Mafia Crip (Loc)
If it's smoke then it's smoke, don't tried to hide with no diss (with no diss)
I had niggas you never seen on your block coolin' (ready)
Tried to bring you out in Texas, this nigga couldn't stop droolin' (Pookie)
You a fiend, you on Molly, you on lean
You on Xannies, you on Percs, you wear panties and a skirt (pussy)
Get a Funk Flex freestyle 'fore you think about talkin' slick
And tell your little homie, one shot deals, to get off my dick (please)
I tried to be humble as long as I could
These niggas is fans, I got fans in all of they hoods
We was doin' shows together (uhh), never hit no hoes together (none)
You's a weirdo and, honestly, in your heart, you know I'm better (you know)
80's side? Homie, you's a military Navy guy
You the dirtiest rapper in New York and every day I'm fly (fly)
You ain't rich rollin', you strugglin' stuck
And everytime you saw me nigga it was nothing but love (all love)
Go watch my KD video, you in that shit dancin'
You ain't know that askin' for smoke help get you cancer?
Die slow, ya'll niggas doin' this for retweets
And I still call Budda Da Future, when I need beats (when I need beats, my nigga)
Since you love Wayno, go make a million with him
Phone out to recordin', can't wait to say you chillin' with him
(You a groupie)
I call my locs in L.A and they never heard of you (nobody)
I call my locs in New York and they never heard of you (nobody)
My Philly niggas don't bang, they just want to murder you
You wanted some minutes of fame, I guess you deserve a few (I got you)
I prey to Allah you take this personal
Twin caskets, one of them bastards gon' share a hearse with you
Spit in your face, you's a stan
Your brother shop in Chinatown how the fuck y'all call him Japan? (ha)
A label from your deal, that's something you want
You got to stop mixin' dust in your blunt (stop)
You got to stop sniffin' coke (stop)
Make a song to give your niggas some hope
It ain't nothin for us to bet cause all them niggas broke
That window of opportunity closin' fast (closed)
If there's a race in New York, all I know is these niggas last (niggas last)
You still live in the same building where I met you
Sucker niggas gassin' you, tellin' you that you special (you ain't shit)
It's sad none of them rappers your respect, respect you (none)
Them dirty ass Chucks, I'm 'bout to re-up on jet fuel (we out)
Bum-ass nigga you older than me
As far as the industry, don't nobody know you but me (nobody)
I'm up in Harlem everyday, tell me who targetin' me (who?)
Niggas just wanna be my friends, they tryna argue with me (not today)
I even put you on my mixtape, I ain't want to shoot no video
You niggas is corny, word to Debo, you'll don't hear me though
Don't have us campin' on your block
Layin' up under cars, you drunk already, you can't handle these shots
You like Pookie when Ice-T tried to help him get on the right track (uh)
Them drugs keep callin' you, I know it's real hard to fight back
They always on us, ain't got to ask, where the pipe at?
You can never do what I did, I know you don't like that
When niggas mention New York and name don't ever come up
Suck my dick, catch me in traffic, sundown to sun-up
I got signed by a legend, I'mma always have one-up (always)
Before I even took this shit serious, had my thumbs up
Heard you was Gangsta Crip (uh)
But now you Neighborhood (word?)
I'm out in Cali with it, you niggas just play your hood
Got niggas callin' me and I ain't 'bout to say you good
Y'all did bad, ain't nothin' you can say that's gon' make it good (not a word)
Could of had a meetin' there was somethin' to discuss
I'm clutchin' on this pistol, y'all niggas just clutchin' my nuts
At least I got a sprinter for niggas, y'all jump from the bus (word)
I'm fuckin' with Snoop, fuckin' with 'Kiss, fuckin' with Puff (legends)
You fuckin' with blues, fuckin' with sniff, fuckin' with dust (dope)
You ever did a tour, we puttin' a bomb under your bus (boom)
I might stunt through Central Park, Horse and Carriage my niggas
You look like a custy, on God, you embarrass your niggas
Fuck favors, from here on out, I'm embarassin' niggas (fuck 'em)
They already dead, I got the money to bury them niggas (chargin')
1 point 5 in year, you can't even imagine
Too many subliminals, honestly I needed some action (I love it)
I got a label I could give you a deal
You stressin', probably finessin' the perk man just to give you a pill
Pussy boy, I'm in a different degree
Cashin' out, I'm gettin' what niggas is gettin for a brick just to speak
I know you want my spot, why the fuck else you mentionin' me? (why else?)
Ain't got to put a bag on you cause you gon' get it for free (nothin')
Ain't goin' back and forth, see me when you see me my nigga
You even went braided your hair, you wanna be me lil nigga

[Outro]
How your man call you a bum-ass nigga?
One and done, no back and forth, man
Karma 2
I love this shit
