[Intro: Dave East & DJ Drama]
Yo, the Bentley truck got four doors (Holiday season)
You see that B on the hood, nigga?
Yo, the Bentley truck got four doors
Yo, the Bentley truck got four doors
(Holiday season)
Yo, the Bentley truck got four doors
You see that B on the hood, nigga?
Only got two
Four door (haha, they ain't seen this)

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Waitin' for my driver to come pick me up
This foreign shit gon' fuck the city up
Got 'em in they feelings 'cause we really up (uh)
80 thousand cash in the Bentley truck (damn)
Pulled me over, think I got a brick
In my hood they tell me I'm the shit
You'll probably find me in some private shit
With more gold than a pirate ship
Slick Rick, 100 chains on
Niggas throwin' shots but they probably miss
I'm probably with a Somali chick
She tryna find out what this molly is
Know the blue and whites hoppin' out
That's why I put my work by the fence
That's why I hit the percs by the bench
Bentley truck swervin', it ain't got no tint

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I used to want a 'rari, look at me now
In a Bentley truck smoking that loud
We never saying sorry, my niggas be wild
Take your chains and the watch
My momma begging me to stop
But I got a million reasons why
Semi-automatic with the stock (brrrrrrrrrrrr)
.45 in the Bentley truck
Doot-doot-doot on your block

[Verse 2: Dave East]
My momma beggin' me to stop it
Smokers beggin' me to cop it
Out the pot, on the table, chop it (chop, chop)
They'll do anythin' to make a profit
Your shit is trash, I'm not hearin' it (trash)
Louis Vuitton and Black Pyramid
Gucci or Prada or Dolce Gabbana
If it ain't 'bout a check, I ain't hearin' it
Expensive designer, I'm wearin' it
I used to wait in the trenches, 50 baggies on a mission
They told me I needed a therapist (uh)
You could get hit for a pair of kicks (uh)
Dice game, we gon' run it back
Treat the block like Merrill Lynch
.45 on me, don't care where I went
Couple Russian hammers, some American

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Dave East]
I used to want a 'rari, look at me now
In a Bentley truck smoking that loud
We never saying sorry, my niggas be wild (saying sorry)
Take your chains and the watch
My momma begging me to stop (stop, sorry momma)
But I got a million reasons why
Semi-automatic with the stock (brrrrrrrrrrrr)
.45 in the Bentley truck
Doot-doot-doot on your block (on your block)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Bitch, I'm the man with the juice (yeah)
I got diamonds on top of diamonds
And my niggas, they stay on the news (ah!)
I stay sippin', water whippin', fresh out the kitchen (brrrrrrrrrrrr)
I bought her the bag and the shoes (ow!)
And I might let my bitch drive the foreign
Mix the molly with pineapple juice
I want the pussy right now, where you goin'?
Look at me, baby, you know you won't find nothin' better
Don't look at me crazy, haha, you know they ain't on my level
And girl, I'm, huh, in the Maison Margielas
When I make it rain, you gon' need an umbrella

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I used to want a 'rari, look at me now
In a Bentley truck smoking that loud
We never saying sorry, my niggas be wild
Take your chains and the watch
My momma begging me to stop
But I got a million reasons why
Semi-automatic with the stock (brrrrrrrrrrrr)
.45 in the Bentley truck
Doot-doot-doot on your block

[Verse 4: Kap G]
.45 on me like MJ, ooh (brrrrrrrrrrrr)
I'm at Benihana's eatin' shrimp steak, woo (skrrt, skrrt)
In the Bentley truck with the semi tucked (woo)
Fuck those pussies, they don't wanna see me up
Goyard, had to put the Fendi up (ayy)
Niggas with the plug, tell 'em ring me up
After the club, yo, I'm callin' your bae up (brrrr)
Takin' that shit and you know we gon' stay up
She give me face, I ain't talkin' about makeup (woo)
Fuck her from the back, pull out the lace front (ayy)
All I ever wanted was some designer
Partner, you the Kap, no 49ers
I'ma beat the pussy, I'm Adrien Broner
She spit on that mic and I might just go sign her

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I used to want a 'rari, look at me now
In a Bentley truck smoking that loud
We never saying sorry, my niggas be wild
Take your chains and the watch
My momma begging me to stop
But I got a million reasons why
Semi-automatic with the stock (brrrrrrrrrrrr)
.45 in the Bentley truck
Doot-doot-doot on your block

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
All my niggas rocking good, all my niggas active (yeah, yeah)
It's 50 for a line, nigga, 250 for the Actavis, huh
Bitches they the baddest, and they just wanna be fucked right
At the after party, girl, where we get naughty, sorry

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I used to want a 'rari, look at me now
In a Bentley truck smoking that loud (yeah, yeah)
We never saying sorry, my niggas be wild
Take your chains and the watch
My momma begging me to stop
But I got a million reasons why
Semi-automatic with the stock (brrrrrrrrrrrr)
.45 in the Bentley truck
Doot-doot-doot on your block
