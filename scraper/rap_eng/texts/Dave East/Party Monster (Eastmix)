[Intro: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
Paranoid (Paranoid)
Paranoid (P-paranoid)
Paranoid (P-paranoid)
But I see something in you (You're paranoid)
Paranoid (Paranoid)
Paranoid (P-paranoid)
Paranoid (P-paranoid)
But I see something in you
(I see something in you)

[Verse]
You mighta heard about Keisha but I had other bitches
My bad, I meant other women a few even cuddled with them
I ain't gon' lie 'bout shit, I'm a real nigga
First things first, I never lie on my dick
If the 4 train wasn't workin', fuck it ride on the 6
Not the same, it's Dirt Gang you gettin' high with a crip
Presidential shit like the 90's, ordered bottles of Cris'
I be quiet, my diamonds talkin' come say 'hi' to my wrist
I'm proud of this shit, bipolar won't say 'hi' to a chick
Rollin' sour on private jets, just for the pilot to hit
Coulda been fuckin' you for years, I won't acknowledge that shit
They ask me to model and shit they say I'm cocky, I'm rich
Before I got on my feet I was gettin' topped in my Jeep
I signed a deal and copped a Rover, now I got room to bent 'em over
I don't know her name but got nothin' but socks on my feet
Shit, I ain't stressin' we both naked plus the Glock by the sheets
They say I'm heatin' up like late June
Can't even respond to these suckers, I be on Shade Room
Percocets, I'ma take two
Even if you show 'em nothin' but love, they'll hate you
The ones that used to curve they wanna suck me, they get facials
Had ten bad hoes at the telly, so we book eight rooms
Spread 'em out on the same on the floor
What you think I brought gang for?
If you ain't tryna give up no action, then what you came for
You know it's other women tryna fuck me on the same tour
Pistol on me, this ain't war
You super cuffin' hoes will take their cape off
I'm 'bout to make a porno at the Aloft
Body after body, I be tryna take a day off
Tryna say what that mouth 'bout, she keep talkin' 'bout weight loss
The fuck is flat tummy tea?
I'm horny like I'm fresh out off of a one of a three
I know a hood, my gun on me
I told Rowdy 'somethin' about me cause they in love with me'
He told me 'Shmurda dance in that pussy don't do no cuddlin'
Monday that's Alexis day
Tuesday fuck with Ashley but she don't drive and when she catch a Uber, she gon' never pay
Wednesday, I got me some head that made me smile different
In traffic, I'm on Karrueche page likin' wild pictures
Get low in my Beamer, now they askin' me shit 'bout Trina
If it wasn't for Instagram y'all wouldn't never seen her
Now I'm pickin' YSL and Versace up out the cleaners
I'm just lookin' for the best head ever, I need a genius

[Outro: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Bitches in my new spot, crowdin' up my space
Had to check the safe, check the dresser for my chains

Paranoid (Paranoid)
Paranoid (P-paranoid)
Paranoid (P-paranoid)
But I see something in you (You're paranoid)
Paranoid (Paranoid)
Paranoid (P-paranoid)
Paranoid (P-paranoid)
But I see something in you
(I see something in you)
