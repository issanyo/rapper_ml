[Intro]

[Hook]
I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit
I'm with the dumb shit, I'm with the dumb shit
I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit
Just tryna function, I'm with the dumb shit
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
I'm with the dumb shit

[Verse 1]
I be with the shits, popped a percocet now my body itch
Hit the lobby quick, pitch it in the open get what I can get
Task force, DTs, gang units, tell 'em suck a dick
They ain't got a check, I ain't showing up
I think I'm the shit, couple yellow mix, pineapple Fanta work
Your man got a job, catch your man at work
My youngin get hyped off his hammer work
You think you religious get jammed at church
God blessin' all the trap niggas
I be in the trap, I don't know too many rap niggas
Playing dummy got me like a mummy, we can rap niggas
My youngins starting arguments just to clap niggas
My man down south on this swipe shit
Running up in Macy's with a white bitch
She got a coke habit, love the white sniff
Todd showed me how to cook it up with my right wrist
Arm & Hammer baking soda in my left wrist
Thinking that you taking this, that's a death wish
We in sacks, I ain't asking what the price is
Blue and whites right behind me, take the exit
Slow down

[Hook]
I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit
I'm with the dumb shit, I'm with the dumb shit
I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit
Just tryna function, I'm with the dumb shit
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
I'm with the dumb shit

[Verse 2]
I'm with the dumb shit
Trapping and rapping I'm still out here hustlin'
Might have not been on the freshmen cover
But I got some caddies and they love me
Bag it up and burn the tip
In the truck, I got your bitch, yes she think I'm rich
I ain't talking Porter, pull up in a foreign
Probably with your daughter, older nigga sick
I don't care bout you used to get it
You can use to have her shit, I used to hit it
Only want it if my crew can get it
I been to committed, copped a new extended
So this ammo ain't never gon' run out
Xanny inside me, I dumb out
I'm the one they talk about when I come out
Fresh up out the studio to the drunk house
If I'm pitching hitters all in the dugout
I ain't tryna hit it cause I already dug out
Knew he in the spot I'ma get him when he come out
My bitch got the drop, run up on him with a tongue out
Licking her lips, now she got him ready to trick
Take her out on trips, told her meet her on the strip
Niggas hopped up out a whip, hit that nigga with some shit
Thanks baby

[Hook]
I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit
I'm with the dumb shit, I'm with the dumb shit
I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit
Just tryna function, I'm with the dumb shit
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
I'm with the dumb shit

[Bridge]
I need my money now
I can feel it in my stomach now
Beamer on it, no need to run him down
Ain't bout no money, don't come around
I need my money now
I can feel it in my stomach now
Beamer on it, no need to run him down
Ain't bout no money, don't come around

[Hook]
I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit
I'm with the dumb shit, I'm with the dumb shit
I pull up my blunt lit, I'm with the dumb shit
Just tryna function, I'm with the dumb shit
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
Go get the money, just go get the money, just go get the money
I'm with the dumb shit
