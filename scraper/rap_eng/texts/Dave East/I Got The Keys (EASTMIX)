[Intro]
Real niggas salute Harlem nigga on the 808
You shoulda known I can rap on this shit too nigga

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to see the real shit
You can separate the real shit from the fake shit
I got a facelift on the i8 BM basic
It just don't add up, it don't make sense
Black suits behind gray tint
Black coupes, oh yeah they twins
Ain't start this to try to make friends
Damn near lost my life for it
On the corner flippin' quarter packs
Played a corner watchin' quarterbacks
Harlem niggas always on the map
Take a beat and make it mine
I was doin' fine, couldn't save a dime
Now I'm Maybach, way back and the seats are reclined
I got the keys, they cost me a lick
I’m by the beach, with dolphins and fish
Spaghetti with wine, still talking bout bricks
I’m taking my time, I’m talking my shit
Gucci flips with the red stripes
Red Stripe, I used to drink those
Every now and then I still do
Know that Cuban real, but how the link close?
Brick and chicken when the sink froze
On the island I don't need clothes
Castaway, free Dre Mack know he got me in beast mode
50,000 in a short week, that's the cash that I dream about
Free Trav, free Charlie and Strap, it's not on purpose if I leave you out
Blame it on the pills and the kush
I know niggas see I got the glow
Actin' like they need me cause they broke
All I need is some Fiji and some dope
Major key alert
Inspired or retired, niggas on me say they need a shirt
I remember nights I prayed the TV work
Fucking up the packs, you never needed work

[Hook]
I got the keys to a brand new apartment
Balcony view, I be lookin at Harlem
Chef in the kitchen, do salmon with garlic
I am retarded, don't get me started

[Verse 2]
I got the keys to the trap
We use it to bag up and break down the pack
Right down the middle, we ain't takin no naps
My young niggas up, my young niggas up, we tryna get back
Like fuck what it costs, I'ma be fresh
Baggin' up dimes, just writin my rhymes, like I'ma be next
Fuckin' with (?) I come at they neck
Pause, these bitches, they know I'm a dog, they tryna get wet
Water falls on Ferrari seats, it ain't hard to see you can't ball with the best

[Hook]
I got the keys to a brand new apartment
Balcony view, I be lookin' at Harlem
Yeah don't get me started
Chef in the kitchen, do salmon with garlic
Yeah, I am retarded
I got the keys to a brand new apartment
Balcony view, I be lookin' at Harlem
Yeah don't get me started
Chef in the kitchen, do salmon with garlic
I am retarded
I got the keys to a brand new apartment lookin' at Harlem
Chef in the kitchen, do salmon with garlic
Do salmon with garlic
I am retarded do not get me started

[Outro]
I got the keys, yeah I got the keys
I got the keys, yeah I got the keys
I got the keys, I got with the keys
Watch out for the D's, niggas watch out for the D's
Sleep with no shower
(?) Phantom spot
