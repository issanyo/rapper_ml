[Intro]
You know this shit is not big enough
Be havin' this shit you know what I mean?
Flippa

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
Travel California, sleep on California king
I got Robert Horry wings, I mean 7 rings
All I know is you can meet me at the top
All I know is you can meet me at the top
Lay on the beach then smoke the cookie, watch the sunset
10k a show, overseas, we just took Quebec
All I know is you can meet me at the top
All I know is you can meet me at the top

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
Find me chillin' with a bitch that looks like (?)
She know that I'm worth a mili
She cleans the birds, they're filthy
(?) before you (?)
Rolex my time
You should see how quick and fast I can count up a dime
(?) don't stop at stop signs
New York my time (?) ass (?)
I ain't fuckin' witcha
You can get your itchy I might pull up (?)
Double barreled (?) the Fanta's the mix
Chopper hold seven like I play for the 6ers
Y'all don't know OG
She get to twerkin', rewindin' slow motion
We go to London to kick it on boats
I ride presidential, the cookie I'm smokin'
10 Spanish bitches while I'm in Spain
Givenchy strap with a fresh pair of Balmains
I'ma maintain and stay away from lames
I (?) work need some change

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Time and time I try to tell these niggas I was tryna get it with a quarter pound
Trap phone died, iPhone workin', fuck it I can take your order now
Plug tried to run his number up, fuck the summer up, then he brought it down
Menu's all up in the kitchen, bakin' soda on my mama plate, bust it down
Brand new Rollie, prolly bust it down
We be in the ghetto, they don't come around
Every day I got my youngin' round
Keep a ladder on 'em, make a drummer sound
Take 100 pounds out to Sacramento
Youngin' 13 but he pack a pistol
Clip on it like a mop stick, Impala hot gotta grab a rental
All white ones, half a brick
Standin' on the couch, I'm blowin' half a zip
Niggas out here sippin' Robatussin, motherfucker you know that ain't Actavis
Like I'm mad at my .40 I slap the clip
You cannot be my shorty you nasty bitch
I'm up in Mason Margiela shit
Not one of you niggas can tell me shit
I don't got no time for no jealous shit
These niggas you mention irrelevant
Post up in the jungle like an elephant
Fuck the whole world, I ain't celibate
Water bottle full of kerosine
Blow your buildin' up, shit you've never seen
Vegetarian, I'm gettin' heavy green
Check the features out, I'm killin' everything
