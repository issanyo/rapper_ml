[Intro: Dave East]
They gon' feel a way, regardless
Everybody feel a way
She feel a way
He feel a way
Fuck it though, nigga
One life

[Chorus: Dave East]
Middle fingers to the fuck niggas that be feeling a way
Cameras all in the projects, feds building a case
I got so tired of the train, now I kick it in a Wraith
I'm never tucking my chain, I put this shit in yo' face
Middle fingers to the fuck niggas that be feeling a way
Cameras all in the projects, feds building a case
I got so tired of the train, now I kick it in a Wraith
I'm never tucking my chain, I put this shit in yo' face

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I put my flag on the left, just pay me in cash or a check
I don't owe nobody nothing and half of these niggas in debt
I went to Gabe with like 80 and got all this shit on my neck
Uh, bust down the Patek Phillipe, when I pull up them niggas, they stressed
Yo BM, she say I'm legend, she driving an Acura Legend
No, you cannot ride through this section, I know that that shit feel depressing
If you do not have you a weapon, that shit that you talking irrelevant
Jeweler got me on some ice like penguin, this is as cold as I've ever been
I feel like Moneybagg, I might go federal if I get caught with this medicine
I used to trap out in Maryland, on campus like I was a terrapin
No turban, we might get yo' head wrapped
Stop acting like you never said that
Supreme got me rocking a red bag
These foreigns be making the feds mad
I got a youngin', he only 16 but he walking around with a 30
He from my building but he play the lobby so early, his closet is dirty
None of his clothes be designer, give him a pack, he gon' line ya
I used to give him consignment, he told me he thinkin bout rhymin'

[Chorus: Dave East]
Middle fingers to the fuck niggas that be feeling a way
Cameras all in the projects, feds building a case
I got so tired of the train, now I kick it in a Wraith
I'm never tucking my chain, I put this shit in yo' face
Middle fingers to the fuck niggas that be feeling a way
Cameras all in the projects, feds building a case
I got so tired of the train, now I kick it in a Wraith
I'm never tucking my chain, I put this shit in yo' face

[Verse 2: D. Jones]
I took a leap with no wings my nigga, just faith
You don't say my face, that's hate
I never fuck with you niggas, that type of shit'd be fake
My next move gon' piss you off, just wait
I been running off of fumes lately, on the low I'm exhausted
I'm tryna guarantee we all eat, that's just the meaning of boss shit
I shine like the sun with the flossers, I sit on a bench with the ballers
I chill with the killers, I'm all in, plus with this glizzy, I'm awesome
Ain't nothing like me, I'm different
Everyday my birthday, boy I'm gifted
All my bitches is foreign, they tripped in
I created a wave, I ain't fit in
Basically, I built a boat, pushed it afloat, then told niggas to get in
Then invited the bitches, oh, we out for the riches
I left with a plan and came back with a bag, oh, that's how that work?
Bitches'll fuck me now but they fronted when I had them stains on my shirt
Benz caught at the vapors, awe they sick, you see they faces
Middle finger to the haters, now let's get back to this paper

[Chorus: Dave East]
Middle fingers to the fuck niggas that be feeling a way
Cameras all in the projects, feds building a case
I got so tired of the train, now I kick it in a Wraith
I'm never tucking my chain, I put this shit in yo' face
Middle fingers to the fuck niggas that be feeling a way
Cameras all in the projects, feds building a case
I got so tired of the train, now I kick it in a Wraith
I'm never tucking my chain, I put this shit in yo' face
