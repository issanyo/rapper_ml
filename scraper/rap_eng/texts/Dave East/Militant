[Intro]
Holiday Season
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
It's holiday season, bitch
Uh

[Verse 1: Dave East]
3 pills in my body got me noddin' off
Really think I'm out this world
Got a condom on but she begging me to take it off
Probably coming out your girl
1942 mixed it with the Clicquot and I'ma probably hurl
Lot of weight
Told the plug I could lift it with my arms, I just gotta curl
I'm killing everything, ain't got a girl
Niggas codeine feignin'
They run out to sell
We had sour diesel by the barrel
Nowadays get it up in the Panamera (skurr)
I played the block with the demons
Where you could get shot for no reason
I grew up plottin' and scheming
Now I drop the top on the beamer
My bitch ain't got her no visa
But I know her pops get it cheaper (I know)
I kick it like soccer, no Fifa (I kick it)
Just watching for robbers and Keishas
Cuzo play the block with the tweakers
100 grams in his pocket, get a slice got me some pizza
Took the foreign top down like it's Caesar
Pussy good, but homie, I wouldn't keep her

[Chorus: Dave East]
Talkin' 'bout money I gettin' it
Talkin' 'bout foreigns, I'm whippin' 'em
That shit make 'em look at you different
Havin' fun, bitch, I feel like a kid again
Lately, I've been close with Benjamin
With no camo on us we militant
Cameras stay on us, we killing shit
I woke up and went to the dealership
That's not my girl, I'm just hittin' it
Cannot be friends with no benefits
I used to trap out them tenements
That Cuban lookin' Dominican
Lately, I've been close with Benjamin
Seats in a foreign, it's cinnamon
Not guilty, they know I'm not innocent
Lately, I've been close with Benjamin

[Verse 2: Don Q]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Currently, I've just been stacking my currency
I'ma need all of mine urgently
I told you I'm in this bitch permanently
Showing no courtesy, I drop the top on 'em purposely
Tell them fuck niggas come search for me
Yeah, yeah
I mix my drink 'till it's purpley
I keep some pints for emergencies, yeah
Whenever you playin' my shit, how to go get it is what you gon' learn from me (what you gon' learn)
Money, the root of all evil, and nigga, that's just what it's turning me
When I'm creeping through the city, no foreign, I tell 'em suburban me
I got that pack on me certainly, nigga
I had your back 'till you turned on me, nigga
Whenever we come out, I'm liable to dumb out when I'm with the guyzas (yeah, yeah)
But if I'm moving doley, then the tooly on me, I ain't with the surprises (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm still cool with the service
All of the workers and all the suppliers (yeah, yeah)
I cruise in the coupe and that bitch bulletproof from the roof to the tires

[Hook: Dave East]
Talkin' 'bout money I gettin' it
Talkin' 'bout foreigns, I'm whippin' 'em
That shit make 'em look at you different
Havin' fun, bitch, I feel like a kid again
Lately, I've been close with Benjamin
With all camo on us we militant
Cameras stay on us, we killing shit
I woke up and went to the dealership
That's not my gun, I'm just hittin' it
Can I be friends with no benefits
I used to trap out them tenements
That Cuban lookin' Dominican
Lately, I've been close with Benjamin
C's in a foreign, it's cinnamon
Not guilty, they know I'm not innocent
Lately, I've been close with Benjamin
