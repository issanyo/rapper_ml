[Intro]
From the set, from the turf
From the set

[Verse]
I'm from the set, yeah I'm from the turf
I just came to get you wet for what it's worth
Go in your skirt, nothing like your last nigga
He used to go in your purse, I go in like it's the first
And I don't think I ever had a bad verse
I was taught that the women gon' come, just get the cash first
That pussy be unforgettable
I hit it in the living room, she texting me at work
Way too busy to give it a chase
She seen my lips, asked if she could sit it on my face
Nah you buggin, you gon' be a stripper today
There's only one pole here and I ain't tippin' no cake
You got me fucked up
I ain't passing nothing
You know you fuck the blunts up
I ain't his father, but you gotta let my son fuck
Henny got me in my mode, I had one cup
Chumped up, 10 bitches, I'm driving one truck
Wrap 'em up, they know the deal
Talking jazz, toss 'em out, I'm Uncle Phil
Fresh prince, fresh tints, call me the Wiz
Probably knockin' Bobby Trends in the Benz
Got yo' wifey on my pillow
I get hotter, Camelo
Out of three, I hit two of them chicks
Gettin' head, top down
DJ Clue in the mix
And pardon my french
Matter of fact pardon my flex
I come from nothing, I don't argue regrets
Honestly, all of this money causing all of this stress
What New York sound like when I be talkin' to Flex
Early morning flow, Angela, Charlamagne and Envy
Waking up to dome, I'm getting brain Lewinsky
Somebody tell Halle Berry that I'm lookin' for her
I ain't a chef, but I'll be in the crib cookin' for her
I don't get how other dudes wouldn't want her
Compare me to Billy Bob, how I put it on her
They done let the wrong Loc around these models
In my the back of mind I'm hoping that they swallow
Jump in the car and I know they gon' follow
Ask me where I from, not far from the Apollo
You ever been to Harlem in your life?
That new nigga that got you starting problems with yo' wife
I only had the bitch in Harlem for a night
[?] put her on this bike [you got the call] and you was tight
Patek Philipe bring the freak out
Mami seen my wrist and started walking to the light
Unforgettable nigga

[Hook: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
