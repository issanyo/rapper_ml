[Intro]
Fell out with my bitch, I ain't call her enough
Dope in my system, I'm all the way up
Fell out with my bitch, I ain't call her enough
Dope in my system, I'm all the way up

[Verse 1]
Lately this money unstoppable, perc from the doctor, this straight out the hospital
Told on your gang and you ain't have a rock on you, get your respect that's impossible
She wanna fuck 'cause I'm popular
Drano, my nigga, let's fuck up a block or two
Eight years ago, I be robbin' you, no reason I got to lie to you (I got to lie to you)
We got the molly, the sour, the xans, the powder too
I needed Fendi ran outta school, we ain't gon' never play by the rules
Made that lil' bitch get up out the room
I got on Dolce Gabbana from next year
Fuck the airport, I get called when the jet here
Bust the Philippe when the check clear
We don't tolerate disrespect here
Bitch you annoying quit calling my phone with the dumb shit
I had a pack in the trunk, see how quick I make it front flip
Stay away from niggas if they don't want shit
I'm on a pill think I'm moonwalkin'
Good niggas die, I done seen that shit too often
Louis my loafers, my boo bought 'em
Bad bitch from New Orleans, no she don't do talking
Secrets is safe with her, I'm in a Wraith with her, new camera might make a tape with her
I'ma just fuck while you dating her, I might vacation her, nigga I'm lying
She tryna go to Jamaica, my focus is paper, I'm selling, who buying
Diamonds all on me, stand out with the lions
Avoided indictments, ghost with no licence

[Chorus]
Dope in my system, I'm all the way up
So many nights in the hallway was stuck
I got on Gucci you ain't never seen
Fell out with my bitch, I ain't call her enough
Dope in my system, I'm all the way up
So many nights in the hallway was stuck
I got on Louis you ain't never seen
Fell out with my bitch, I ain't call her enough

[Verse 2]
We don't drive by, we just walk up and bust
Shut the fuck up, bitch, you talking to much
I posted up in the hallway with dust
Perc in my body, I'm all the way stuck
Keep your pistol if you talk like you tough
Artificial bitches talking 'bout nothin'
VIP me I just walked up with money, coughing up hunnids
Yeah, bitch, I'm all the way blunted
Promoter scared to book me, all of us coming
Jump right out the pussy, go get the money
Run up the bag and, bitch, I got it jumping
Thinking back, in the trap I had a onion
I broke it down wit cuh and bagged up the dummies
Junkies scratching, on they back, got a monkey
Ran off on the plug, now that could get ugly
I told her don't act like you love me
If I got some product, come package it for me
The minute I step out the wagon, they touch me
It's no better feeling than having this money
Dusty lil' nigga, they acted so funny
They used to ignore, now they act like they want me
I be on tour, getting bags out the country
My daughter got Christian Dior on the onesie
Everything that I roll up look like Gumby
All of my women belong on a centerfold
I keep me one on the side like a dinner roll
She grab the dick like she working the stripper pole
Pull up like, "What is the business bro?"
I'm that nigga if you didn't know
Losers tryna follow where the winners go
.40 with the hollows, make 'em dip it low

[Chorus]
Dope in my system, I'm all the way up
So many nights in the hallway was stuck
I got on Gucci you ain't never seen
Fell out with my bitch, I ain't call her enough
Dope in my system, I'm all the way up
So many nights in the hallway was stuck
I got on Louis you ain't never seen
Fell out with my bitch, I ain't call her enough
Dope in my system, I'm all the way up
So many nights in the hallway was stuck
I got on Gucci you ain't never seen
Fell out with my bitch, I ain't call her enough
Dope in my system, I'm all the way up
So many nights in the hallway was stuck
I got on Louis you ain't never seen
Fell out with my bitch, I ain't call her enough
