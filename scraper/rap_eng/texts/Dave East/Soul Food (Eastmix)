[Verse 1]
Never had it go get the most
Whole outfit was baggy, can't tell if I had the toast
Just walking through the hood
No traveling when you broke
I'm in madison sippin ghost
I bagged it up and I smoke nigga
Blue rags ignite the fire
Freddy & Jason out, they forgot about Michael Myers
No chasin, walk up on you I won't waste it
It's dinner time, I'm giniune so anxious
My b-more shorty was nervous like yo dangerous
In 01 almost eight racks for four aces
Aye one doe I love your mother like mine
Budda already know I loved your mother like mine
Seen a nigga shot in the face I was like nine
And anytime the dope was a nine it was aligned
Life changed we was servin in the south
Came back uptop
Copped my bitch the berkin with the pouch
Was bagging up off-white before Virgil put it out
Bad energy I don't need it I heard you, nigga bounce

[Hook]
Shots fly they get to steppin like It's Martin crib
Got your bitch on two 5th getting us all some fish
I text her, I ain't never ever call your chick
She text back like me and my nigga called it quits
I was in the back room when you came to get all your shit
You gave her all of your heart
I gave her all of this dick
They think shooter a handicap how he walk with the stick
I'm just talking my shit
My apartment was lit
Nas got me out of Six-E

[Verse 2]
Backdoor never locked leezey had that tinsky
Cold in the summertime, hot when It's snowfall
Niggas keep my name in they mouth
Can't say I know y'all
One thing for sure I'm for certain, I don't owe y'all
It was either I get a deal or get this coke off
Can't even count the amount of people I broke off
Little problem go down hill It start to snowball
The collar on my daughter dog goyard
These niggas is playing fouler than Mota
With birdy on the side like handle your business
For 3500 we'll handle the witness (that's light!)
I got no remorse, your man is a menace
Free my niggas out them jails, they standin against us
I talk the type of shit that demand me attention
Middle finger to the cop while he hand me the ticket
If you do it for the likes than your gram'll be clickin
We had grams in the kitchen
Can you handle the mission?
If you gotta go slide if not that's not how you built
My daughter won't know if I do not got a dollar for milk
Givenchy theres leather on that jacket the Prada is silk
I knock em down like I'm Will
Try me and probably get killed

[Pre-hook]
I knock em down like I'm Will
Try me and probably get

[Hook]
Shots fly they get to steppin like It's Martin crib
Got your bitch on two 5th getting us all some fish
I text her, I ain't never ever call your chick
She text back like me and my nigga called it quits
I was in the back room when you came to get all your shit
You gave her all of your heart
I gave her all of this dick
They think Lo handicapped how he walk with the stick
I'm just talking my shit
My apartment was lit
Nas got me out of Six-E (2x)
