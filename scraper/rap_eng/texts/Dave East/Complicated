[Verse 1: Dave East]
Let's be honest, shorty
I got bitches, you got niggas, don't be modest, shorty
Complicated but simple, I don't know how to call it
I be smoking you be drinkin', we both tired of fallin' in lust
I can't find nobody, I can zone out and can talk to
I don't want no wifey, don't get mad if I don't call you
Get you Chanel shit, from what they gave me at this walk through
I can tell you ain't had nobody to give your all to
Understand I'm street as fuck, might get you a beamer truck
I was taught just throw some bread, every time I seen a duck
Grippin' and I keep it tucked, she felt it while she huggin' me
Am I happy to see you, nah, this shit help me move comfortably
Sit you down in front of me, massage you like I love your soul
You sleep all up under me, I treat you like the one I chose
It's complicated, your momma hate it, I get inside, you say I'm amazin'
Fresh out the shower, I probably taste it, no conversation
What is love when you lustin', afraid of trust and you either fuckin' or fussin'
I never happen to rush it, that make 'em come fuck the function up
That's why I got no connections, just chicks that wanna fuck
Then argue, I don't love enough, make sure I pick some rubbers up
Kairi don't need no sisters, probably only make women
My past chicks is forbidden, from livin' this life with me
You might of came to studios but you ain't write for me
You only watch me pour my lean, ain't sip no Sprite with me
She got ass, look at her face, my niggas' hypin' me
Still can't take this ride with me, I think about you, while I'm fuckin' her
It's complicated, I'm tellin' on myself, won't say another word

[Verse 2: Wale]
It’s complicated to find a lady in my generation
That’s not preoccupied with social clout
We almost fazing out from the high we get from love and conversation
To go on IG galavanting for likes and shit, oh, it’s complicated
I’m tryna say I need loyalty like Clyde Barrow was tryna get
When Bonnie was shot up riding shotgun with him
My problems are justified but, I gotta admit
I got someone who loves me so effortless
But, I’m so messed up from another chick I feel like such a bitch ass nigga
That my exes got the power with no effort to decline the next shawty I get
So, I’m guarded and shit
But, never mind that 'cause you're a goddess and shit
What I’m tryna say is I like you but it’s complicated
Foundation on all my pillows, still your tender face is flawless when the sky kiss you
Should I bury you in compliments or buy gifts or
Just let you tell me bye and for that time I’ll miss you
My life is fairly complicated
You show too much of your heart I promise they confiscate it
I am young, black, and accomplished baby but
I’m not the type to bring home to mama, I’m just crazy
'Cause I’m broad crazy, monogamy’s kind of hard for me
When I start throwing them curves that’s when they caught feelings
I got famous at a young age, I’m spoiled
I get paid, don’t go out so the club scene I’m bored of
I don’t believe in unicorns nor pure love, but more so the latter, seen Porzingis from courtside
I got missed calls from porn stars and church girls
You’d be surprised who get the wildest and squirt more

[Bridge]
Let’s be honest shawty
I got bitches you got niggas don’t be modest shawty
Don’t care about your IG pictures I don’t follow anyway
'Cause, if I really like you I don’t like your pictures, dig it?

[Verse 3]
I believe that love is complicated at best
And at it’s worst it’s a permanent burning in your chest
I pray to earn that from somebody someday
But, somehow someway, I no longer have a heart to invest
It’s miles away, the smiles is fake and my job ain’t real
Why would you think I’ll find a woman who is?
I’m high today, tomorrow I’m chill 'cause my job get real
What mature woman would put up with my shit?
I mean I’m damaged goods
I mean, I’m rather good at being just kind of good to women who deserve more from me
But, I see you as something more than a purring kitty
You hate my state of mind, somehow you think the world of me

[Outro]
It’s complicated
It’s complicated
It’s complicated
It’s complicated
Just be honest shawty
I got bitches you got niggas don’t be modest shawty
Don’t care about your IG pictures I don’t follow anyway
'Cause if I really like you I won’t... fuck it
Block all them bitches, 'cause it’s complicated
