[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Doctor, I did a CAT scan on my brain this morning
And they found money on my mind, you dig

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Dave East]
Woke up with some money on my mind (money)
Woke up with some money on my mind (money)
Woke up, counting hundreds all the time (count it up)
Woke up, eyes zoom in on my mind (money)
I said doctor (doctor), I need a CAT scan (me too)
Doctor, I need a CAT scan (me too)
Woke up with some money on my mind (run it up, run it up)
Woke up with some money on my mind (run it up, run it up)

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I think 'bout this money, it got me
Fill my Backwood with biscotti (gelato)
I'm Jordan, this paper be Scottie
Hope I don't catch me a body
Fifty thousand, it won't fit in no wallet
Public housin', we was stuck in them projects
Sixty-five, I can't drive a Bugatti
Fell out with the plug, I'm back in with Papi
Lambo truck is all I want to get
Forty drummin' on some thunder shit
Rubber grip, it hold a hundred clip
I just fell out with another bitch
I'ma get back on the late night
I think I might need a CAT scan
Fifties and hundreds, my x-ray
More green than when the Jets play
Overnight then work the next day
UPS or we can FedEx
I'm tryna make me some money with her
After that I get the head next
Thinking back when I was dead stressed
Sellin' dimes, two for fifteen
Three for twenty if I'm up already
She playin' with it, tryna fuck already

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Dave East]
Woke up with some money on my mind
Woke up with some money on my mind
Woke up, counting hundreds all the time
Woke up, I had something on my mind
I said doctor, I need a CAT scan (yo doctor)
Doctor, I need a CAT scan (money)
Woke up with some money on my mind (uh)
Woke up with some money on my mind

[Verse 2: Dave East]
My pistol is black, these hundreds is blue
I'm at the bank almost every day
See this shit on me, you know that it's true
I never gave a fuck, me and this paper stuck
This shit be feeling like glue
I Range-d the truck, how could I make this up
I'm just a nigga like you
I'm from the bottom where we gon' get money regardless
I'm not no regular artist
FN, this bitch came with a cartridge
I had that butter shit, I called it margarine
Now I make more than my teachers
I bet I black out on all of my features
Broke, I call my cousin for sneakers
Smoke, they don't want none of that neither
Valor sweats like it's '89, me and Tory on some shit again
She talk about me like a cornball, knowin' she gon' let me hit again
Militant, from the trenches, I can count up a million
Tryna wake up on an island like Gilligan
All of this money robbed me of my innocence

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Woke up with some money on my mind
Woke up with some money on my mind
Woke up, counting hundreds all the time
Woke up, I had something on my mind
I said doctor, I need a CAT scan
Doctor, I need a CAT scan
Woke up with some money on my mind
Woke up with some money on my mind
