*Jahlil Beats, Holla at me!'

[Talking: Neef Buck]
Realadelphia, Harlem World, let's go!

[Chorus: Neef Buck]
Own the whip; I got it
New bitch; I got it
New money; I got it
My jewels lit; I got it
New condo; I got it
Send more bottles; I got it
The tab come; I got it
Need more ones; I got it

Now fuck it up (8x)
Nigga I ain't scared, bitch I ain't scared
Nigga, I ain't scared, bitch, I ain't scared

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Where we at? Posted up where you serve at
They said East wasn't getting to it, I'm like
"where the fuck niggas heard that?" smell regular up in the air
I'm like "where the fuck niggas burn that?"
Front the pack, take the work back, for a couple racks
Take a dirt nap
Fiends probably still think about me, all the traps that I worked at
All the traps that I worked out, backwood lit when I merc out
Delhi, Dauphin Street, young wild niggas do one thing
Fuck bitches, trap all day, hit KOP, do one thing
Hard white or soft white, no R&B but this Gun sing
On the block with the slip on, Margielas on, I don't want strings
Ski mask and my Balmains, we smoke sour like Newports
Since 96', I've been a flight risk, ask my lawyer, I don't do court
I'm a tall nigga with a thick bitch
And a big whip, knockin' too short
Niggas envy me in the new drop
Call it Kennedy; I took the roof off
(?) know I'm burned out, I'm bipolar, my mind gone
Rolex that's presidential, these hard bottoms, they Tom Ford

[Chrous: Neef Buck]

[Verse 2: Neef Buck]
I ain't entertaining you clowns, I ain't part of no circus
I got lawyer money but ask yourself is it worth it
Know they want me to son em, I ain't even a father
Just accepting my blessings and tryna get to a dollar
Red and green on the kicks, match the snake on my collar
If it ain't beneficial then I don't wanna be bothered
If they charge for attention, you niggas wouldn't be mentioned
Been getting money so long, like I'm collecting a pension
And I'm matching the gas, I'm disrespecting the engine
All they be with is niggas like "where the fuck is their women?!"
Can't please everybody so I'm just pleasing myself
Took a risk with my chips, I ain't wait for the help!
Block bumping with no order, WD, I got water
Cigerette dipped in Pistol grip and Trash bag king
Gotta handle my business
Young boys wildin', nothing but violence
Number one code; better keep your silence
Bomb juice and a good number
Streets know this my summer!

[Chorus: Neef Buck]
