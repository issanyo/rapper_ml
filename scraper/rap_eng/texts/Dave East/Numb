[Intro]
Been a while since I felt anything man. Body cold. I don't feel nothing no more. No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate. I don't feel it. No feelings, let me just live. Numb to the world

[Hook]
I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more
No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate
I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live
Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is
I'm numb

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling like this since I buried 'Lik
Waking up in cold sweats, paranoid I rarely sleep
I might be smiling to the public but inside I'm dead
All I see is bodies, bunch of memories inside my head
[?] caught a leg shot, shook it off, he walking now
Told me if he ain't got his hammer then he don't be walkin' around
[?] daughter growing, look at [?] she talking now
Pooch caught the same shot so he cautious now
I'm too familiar with pain, I watched my aunt pass
Her and pops smoking, I was tryna catch a contact
My man sold cable, they hired him up at Comcast
He ain't wanna give up his jewelry, his life had cost that
Drugs done had you watch your uncle like y'all ain't related
I'm from where niggas'll kill just you don't make it
Barely had the opportunity so when it come I take it
Fuck a jail cell, I rather lay up with some bitches naked

[Hook]
I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more
No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate
I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live
Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is
I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more
No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate
I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live
Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is
I'm numb

[Verse 2]
Like I sniffed a line of cocaine
Thinking I ain't had no cab money, I'd ride on the train
Me and Gutta in his mother crib, high on our brain
Watched a couple niggas change, we ain't vibing the same
I mean niggas I would ride with, roll up, get high with
Before the Nas cosign, we was stuck in the projects
Free my nigga Sheek, we had our differences, I still love him
I'm still hustling, only difference I don't feel nothing
Same niggas act like I didn't even exist
Tryna hit me up on Instagram like East is the shit
Dropped out, said fuck school, I know my teachers is sick
Cause when they turn on MTV, their kids repeating my shit, that's life
I came a long way from riding in that Cherokee
Father still in therapy, they fucked my man back up
Had a bunch of problems, I ain't never called no back up
Popping xannies, my plug tight with me fucking my packs up

[Hook]
I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more
No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate
I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live
Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is
I'm numb, I don't feel nothing no more
No shine, no rain, no crying, no pain, no love, no hate
I don't feel it, no feelings, let me just live
Numb to the world, I don't know what this feeling is
I'm numb
