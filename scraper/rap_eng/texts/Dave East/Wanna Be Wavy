[Intro: Quilly]
This shit be driving me crazy
Hey..

[Hook: Quilly]
I'm runnin' in and out of town
I'm booking flights, I get around
Ain't no tomorrow; get it now
Man ain't no time to be lazy
(ain't no time to be lazy) x2
Hey, I'm runnin' in and out of court
Them smokers up and down my block
Watching my back; there go the cops
This shit be driving me crazy (this shit be driving me crazy)
I just wanna be wavy ( I just wanna be wavy)
Hey..

[Verse 1: Dave East]
In the state with plenty weight
Moscato drinking; sippin' great
Condo shopping; pick a place
We worked it out; my fitness great
I just blew like 1500 on some shit I never needed
I just wanted dinner every night, was ducking every precinct
Project had me paranoid, lobby cameras helped them watch
Robbed him for his apple watch, that dope was raw; they had to cop
All this guap I'm earning now
Fiends take a pull, they get to twerkin' now
My bitch from Germantown, she gotta Birkin now
Catch me if you can, I play gingerbread with the police
Balmain pockets obese, got garden floor seats
Niggas' that can't keep their mouth shut, call that a slow leak
I wanted to drop out, take the block route, that was 03
When [?] played [?]  with them baggies, I played the [?]
In Baltimore, I just played the alley, now we do Cali
Talking Crenshaw, we stomp niggas' out then brush our timbs off
I broke up with my last bitch, on my jacket, she found lipgloss
I'm tryna take these Ratchets to Manhattan before I dip off
First class to Dallas and time for the marriage tip off
I'm gone

[Hook: Quilly]
I'm runnin' in and out of town
I'm booking flights, I get around
Ain't no tomorrow; get it now
Man ain't no time to be lazy
(ain't no time to be lazy) x2
Hey, I'm runnin' in and out of court
Them smokers up and down my block
Watching my back; there go the cops
This shit be driving me crazy (this shit be driving me crazy)
I just wanna be wavy ( I just wanna be wavy)
Hey..

[Verse 2: Quilly]
Uh, trapped in the coldest weather
Fresh wheats, 7's sagging, Marc Buchanan leather
Cops circle, keep it pushin' nigga; salt-n-pepa
You was with me when I was pop, we eatin' all together
Fuck it, let's get it this chedda, it's whatever
Mom smokin', same shit I'm sellin', niggas' tellin
Bitches open, niggas' reachin'
If they cross me, I'ma Holy Ghost em
That boy perc'd out his mind, hater don't approach him
Fuck it don't provoke him
My bitches bussin' checks, my niggas' bussin' scripts
I'm in the field; Cam Newton and we up by 6
Suck a dick
Bugs Bunny old shit, Balenciaga chrome shit
3 for 10's, 2 for 5's on my flip phone shit
Bill Cosby; bitches always bringing up old shit
You a wave rider, cock slider, you just hold dick
She gon' give them panties up, I'ma shoot the family up
Wit an open case, I was lost, broke and Xanie'd up
3 whistles and some coke, I fought it like a homi case
A lot of pills, a lot of weight, on my corner
Out of state
Sippin' Hi-Tech, bent; Mr. Miyagi face
If I go upstate, is she gon' wait? fuck; prolly skate
I can make it any day man, preliminary; 8 bands
Floor seats wit the mikes, Mike (?) on space jam

Watching my back; there go the cops
This shit be driving me crazy (this shit be driving me crazy)
