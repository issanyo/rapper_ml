[Verse 1]
I got my chrome wit' me
Back in the day, I wanted to bone Chilli
My crib private, can't take you home wit' me
Racks? I done blown fifty, copped my own blickies (Uh)
Free Taxstone quickly as I put on Biggie (Biggie)
Ain't got my phone wit' me (Uh-uh)
Not tryna talk, most of these hoes silly (Silly)
They know my name throughout my whole city (New York)
A couple hoes showin' titties, brought my locs wit' me (It's cracking)
And we ain't sharin' cars, watch Shooter cop his own Bentley (Watch)
You can't make  no songs wit' me (Uh-uh)
'Get Rich' came out and we put on 50
I never thought that I'd get on quickly (Not me)
Forty on me, don't tempt me, labels won't pimp me (At all)
Paint the five fifty lemonade as I flow, simply (Skrt)
Rockin' old Dickies, she know not to leave no hickies (Not one)
I lived in the projects, a couple hoes wouldn't come home wit' me (I know)
Mad niggas crossed me, you'd have thought I had the Pope wit' me
Where I'm from left me numb, ain't no lines of coke in me (None)
It used to be Corona, Heineken, now it's Patron, Henny
I used to be in spots baggin' the rock, I made my own milly
I'm from a cold city (Cold), where my auntie wouldn't want us out late, scramblin', tryna get us a plate (Scramblin')
Baggin' up, sellin' shake, I seen my neighbor wit' a needle, how that medicine taste? (How?)
He said this medicine great
The shit I been through, you could never relate (Never)
Watchin' for the blue and whites of vans with federal plates (Watch)
Smell that? That's jealousy, hate (Jealousy)
You ain't get those from Barney's, nigga, those Margielas are fake
Imagine a nigga owe you, he keep tellin' you, "Wait" (Wait)
Tryna figure out how he died, they found his head in a lake (I don't know)
Get bread and we skate, it feel like I get better wit' age (Better)
They told me, "Never say never" but I was never afraid
I'm probably the only rookie that got veteran ways (Only one)
You on my dick, you and your bitch probably met on my page (Met on my page)

[Chorus]
Had 'roaches in the crib, not tryna take her home wit' me (No)
Nothin' in the fridge, not tryna take her wit' me (Nothin')
It's smokers is where I live, not tryna take her home wit' me (Home)
Hit the yard and spin, if I get in, I got that chrome wit' me (It's on)
There's 'roaches where I live, not tryna take her home wit' me
It's nothin' in the fridge, not tryna take her home wit' me (Nothin' in the fridge)
It's smokers where I live, not tryna take her home wit' me
Hit the yard and spin, if I get in, I got that chrome wit' me

[Verse 2]
I know it's some niggas that feel like it ain't shit to do but watch me (Keep watchin')
That's why every time they see me in in new Givenchy (Mean)
True to posse, get indicted if you movin' sloppy
This is the mob, tailor suited like I'm Luca Brasi (Brasi)
Way too cocky to ever find out a groupie got me (Uh)
Cuzzo been down since the 90s, blamed it on Giuliani
I'm rockin' two chains, sneakers 'cause that's that new Versace (My niggas)
I move like Gotti, just tryna pick up the newest Mozzie (The newest)
I been in the lab wit' Nas, been in the stu' wit' Mozzy (My niggas)
Soon as he got back from the D.R., I made a move wit' poppy (Poppy)
I might be on your block or on your TV, nigga, you could watch me (Watch me)
Just ran outta bullets, if I pull it, I know Shooter got me (On go)
Got some pain on my mind, need a beat, I know Bud'da got me
Bike life, cuz did a drive-by on a blue Ducati (Bang, bang)
Remember beggin' my mother to buy me new Huaraches (I need 'em)
In class with niggas that hated niggas like I'm in school with Nazis
Common sense expensive, can't afford to have no fools around me (I can't)
I'm from the trenches, not a crib, afford to have that pool surrounded
Remember when M&Ms was candy? (Remember?)
Now M&M stand for Maybachs and Monclairs (Uh)
Corleon in my aura, feel like the don here (Don)
You can hear that Audemar tickin', you think a bomb there (Bomb)

[Chorus]
Had 'roaches in the crib, not tryna take her home wit' me ('Roaches)
Nothin' in the fridge, not tryna take her wit' me (Not a thing)
It's  smokers is where I live, not tryna take her home wit' me (Uh-uh)
Hit the yard and spin, if I get in, I got that chrome wit' me (I got it)
There's 'roaches where I live, not tryna take her home wit' me (I got it)
It's nothin' in the fridge, not tryna take her home wit' me (I'm not)
It's smokers where I live, not tryna take her home wit' me (Where I live)
Hit the yard and spin, if I get in, I got that chrome wit' me (That chrome wit' me)
