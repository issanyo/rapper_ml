[Verse]
I ain't got no time for the fake shit
They talk behind my back, how I make shit
I look 'em in they eyes and they face sick
When you start getting money, you a Mason
I don't believe in god wit a white face, devil on me I been tryna be patient
Couldn't name another nigga that could shake shit
Drunk sleeping in the park, couldn't pay rent
Come outside after dark, hope Christ with you
Loyalty is when they really spend they life with you
Couple niggas hating on me, that's a light issue
Inside of that foreign look like white tissue
Shitting on these niggas like my stomach hurt
Don't make me find out where your mother work
We be laying under cars for a couple percs
Bitch, I'm in the mob, I don't want to work
I don't know the last job I had, we was lining niggas up for a dime and a half
I done spent so much time doing bad
I just wanna put my mom in a Jag
I'm on Lennox, day one, I be matching
Got a homie that be hungry for the madness
Follow niggas in they car when it's cracking
I know niggas still selling hard with a passion
You never seen a fiend strip butt naked
Thinking back when I ain't have one record
I was in the slums where they love pressing
Where you can't leave the crib without one weapon
That's why we keep a couple real close by
Goyard duffle, I be so fly
Hardest in New York, that ain't no lie
Different kind of taste, I don't know why
I only shop if the shit expensive
They know who I am, this is bigger business
I be getting racks just to show up
Imagine if I tell a nigga, "Kill the witness"
New Gucci boots look like Timbs, tho
All my life, my pops had a Benzo
Charlie said he gotta do eleven months
I'm thinking where the fuck did all my friends go
I'm somewhere in the valley where the wind blow
Ordering a salad for a slim hoe
Thinking how these fuck niggas must feel
But I can understand them 'cause I been broke
I can understand, I ain't have much
I just put my mom in a condo
Nigga, I just put my mom in a condo
Smoking on a bomb, got my eyes low
I was popping pills in my building
I just signed a deal worth a million
Praying Scrap Low get appealed, I'm still out in the field with a drill that will kill him
I think I'm Makaveli in the flesh
Got it feeling like Pac in the building
Call Lenny S, get the Roc in the building
In the school zone, watching cops while I'm dealing
In a new zone, I ain't stopping, I'm plotting
I facetimed Meek and he told me how to get it
Money in the floor, stash the guns in the ceiling
This dope fiend told me she in love with the feeling
She rather get high then to go to work
I gotta get high when I go to work
We live and we die, ain't no tears in my eyes
I remember telling mama, I don't wanna work
Praying everyday but I don't go to church
You gon' die before I see my little brother hurt
I just spent fifty on a time piece
I remember telling niggas, "Rap was gonna work"
Praying everyday but I don't go to church
You gon' die before I see my little brother hurt
I just spent fifty on a time piece
I remember telling niggas ,"Rap was gonna work"
