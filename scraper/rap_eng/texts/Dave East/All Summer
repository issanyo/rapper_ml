[Intro]
I'm just tryna ball all summer
I'm just tryna ball all summer

[Hook]
I'm just tryna ball all summer
Shorty mad at me I ain't call all summer
Pullin up in big trucks, all Hummers
Dice game, I got the bank all numbers ( headcrack )
This money got your baby momma callin' me
If it ain't bout no paper then don’t talk to me
Ain't too many of us left, that ain't hard to see
I hardly sleep, I'm just makin' sure we all can eat

[Verse 1]
June, July, and August we in Porsches
My bitches gorgeous, check the engine, it's horses
Welcome to New York, the police be in them Taurus
New Jersey condo, that shit feel like a fortress
Drunk at the ATM, I can't remember what I took out
Henny coladas, I'm kinda saucy at the cook out
Wepaa!
Sellin' dimes on a bicicleta
Mommy in my ear speakin' spanish but what the head bout?
Your make up all slay, bitch we all paid
Everybody rockin' chains like we all slaves
You couldn't imagine the sacrifices we all made
Dior shades on, rollin' up at the ball game
Fuck an indictment, I hustle with my right hand
Got a freak with me, this chick could swallow a Sprite can
D's hopped out of them white vans, I was like damn
Growin' up in Harlem we all wanted to be like Cam
I got on designer, I be lookin' like I might scam
Sittin' on them couches if it's bouncin then I might stand
I'd rather be travelin', Louie sandals and white sand
My auntie kept her a pistol right by the night stand

[Hook]
I'm just tryna ball all summer
Shorty mad at me I ain't call all summer
Pullin up in big trucks, all Hummers
Dice game, I got the bank all numbers
This money got your baby momma callin' me
If it ain't bout no paper then don’t talk to me
Ain't too many of us left, that ain't hard to see
I hardly sleep, I'm just makin' sure we all can eat

[Verse 2]
Three dice
I'm thinkin' nice I didn't sleep nice
I ain't eat right
Was in the streets like
Sidewalks and pavement but I stood tall
Malik said I would make it, that was a good call
I still remember who hated before I took off
Middle of Brooklyn orderin' sandwiches by woodhull
Summer nights -- sundresses and big blunts
Baltimore BCC, I spent 6 months
My mind right
I was always ready for limelight
Chocolate bitch, she thick, complexion Klondike
I'm always fresh, you probably think it's my prom night
My paper was short, I'm stackin' till it's Lebron height
Ain't spoke in a minute, she text me "hey stranger"
Let her see that I read it but I gave her no reply (curve)
I'm sick of seein' y'all in public with them waist trainers
And all them snapchat filters is just another lie
Shoot outs in the park but we used to it
Police chase us after dark, we just move through it
See a dime and start pursuin' cause (?)
90 degrees, I'm in the kitchen like I'm Martha Stewart (whip it)

[Hook]
I'm just tryna ball all summer
Shorty mad at me I ain't call all summer
Pullin up in big trucks, all Hummers
Dice game, I got the bank all numbers
This money got your baby momma callin' me
If it ain't bout no paper then don’t talk to me
Ain't too many of us left, that ain't hard to see
I hardly sleep, I'm just makin' sure we all can eat

[Hook]
I'm just tryna ball all summer
Shorty mad at me I ain't call all summer
Pullin up in big trucks, all Hummers
Dice game, I got the bank all numbers
This money got your baby momma callin' me
If it ain't bout no paper then don’t talk to me
Ain't too many of us left
