[Intro]
I just wanna say thank you to every hater
Thank you (Thank you)
Every, every city I go (I go, I appreciate it)
(From the bottom of my heart)
I ain't ever tell 'em my name (No more, no more, no more)
(I mean that)

[Chorus]
Wake up every mornin' I pray
I done came a real long way (long way)
Every other city I go (I go)
I ain't ever gotta tell 'em my name (my name)
If you hatin' I just wanna say "Thank you"
Know you doin' something right when they hate you
Runnin' 'round tellin' people how they made you
Only reason why they mad, 'cause they ain't you
Wake up every mornin' I pray
I done came a real long way (long way)
Every other city I go (I go)
I ain't ever gotta tell 'em my name (my name)
If you hatin' I just wanna say, "Thank you"
Know you doin' something right when they hate you
Runnin' 'round tellin' people how they made you
Only reason why they mad, 'cause they ain't you

[Verse 1]
Nowadays I pull up in a Range, I remember hoppin' that train
I gotta thank God for all the pain that got a nigga all up in the game
Foreign, I be out with my gang
They jackin' I changed and I didn't
I get your back on that pint, switch up fitted
Nowadays, niggas just look at me different
Pay me for what? I just handle my business
I play with them Benz, I can't handle a ticket
I know I came up, but don't act like you don't know me
You wasn't around back when I had to get it
Wasn't around back when I had to hustle
Wasn't around back when I used to struggle
We used to throw all that cash in a duffle
Now all this cash keep me right out of trouble
Thank You

[Chorus]
Wake up every mornin' I pray
I done came a real long way (long way)
Every other city I go (I go)
I ain't ever gotta tell 'em my name (my name)
If you hatin' I just wanna say "Thank you"
Know you doin' something right when they hate you
Runnin' 'round tellin' people how they made you
Only reason why they mad, 'cause they ain't you
Wake up every mornin' I pray
I done came a real long way (long way)
Every other city I go (I go)
I ain't ever gotta tell 'em my name (my name)
If you hatin' I just wanna say, "Thank you"
Know you doin' something right when they hate you
Runnin' 'round tellin' people how they made you
Only reason why they mad, 'cause they ain't you

[Verse 2]
We up in the sky right now
Used to fall asleep in the spot where the fiends ran down
Like, "I want a rock right now"
This is for them niggas tryna plot right now
We up in the section, my niggas is flexin', I can see you hype, calm down
The girls say I'm different, the G's know I'm gettin' it, I'm shittin', the drop all brown (ugh)
They don't wanna see you get no real money (nah)
They don't wanna see you with no foreign (nah)
They don't wanna see you with that top model (top model)
If we winnin', I'm just makin' sure I'm scorin'
State to state, now they makin' sure I'm tourin' (we out)
Every time I speak, they recordin'
Now when we eat bigger portions (we eatin')
I go to sleep thinkin' Porches

[Chorus]
Wake up every mornin' I pray
I done came a real long way (long way)
Every other city I go (I go)
I ain't ever gotta tell 'em my name (my name)
If you hatin' I just wanna say, "Thank you"
Know you doin' something right when they hate you
Runnin' 'round tellin' people how they made you
Only reason why they mad, 'cause they ain't you
Wake up every mornin' I pray
I done came a real long way (long way)
Every other city I go (I go)
I ain't ever gotta tell 'em my name (my name)
If you hatin' I just wanna say "Thank you"
Know you doin' something right when they hate you
Runnin' 'round tellin' people how they made you
Only reason why they mad, 'cause they ain't you
