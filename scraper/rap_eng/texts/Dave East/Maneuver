[Intro: Dave East & French Montana]
La musica de Harry Fraud
I maneuver
Montana!
Put it up, Fraud
Ah

[Hook: Dave East & French Montana]
If it's 'bout a bag, I maneuver (I maneuver)
I'm on the hand-to-hand maneuver (I maneuver)
Fresh up out the trap, I maneuver (I maneuver)
In that foreign, I maneuver

[Post-Hook: Dave East & French Montana]
VVSes on me, keep my weapon on me
Patek Philippe (yeah), my bitch a freak (yeah)
Now tell me how you want it, them bad bitches on it (on it)
A hundred freaks  (yeah), a hunnid Vs  (yeah)

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
I'm just praying that the feds don't never come and get me (I'm praying)
What do you say to a youngin' knowing his stomach empty (starving)
He just wanna unload, shoot 'til his gun is empty (boom)
We hustle smart (smart), never just wanted any cash (nah)
These niggas robbing from Pathmarks, stealing from Jimmy Jazz
Welcome to gangland, don't come without no visit pass (don't come)
Last year, imagine I counted over a million cash

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Made it out the jungle, came back in a Jaguar (Skrrt)
Shawty ass fat with a cat back
Check checks, so that straight cash (Now tell me you want it, eh)
Suit suit to that ski mask  (Now tell me you want it, eh)
The bitch ballin' like Cooper, German Sheppard, German Ruger
Baby all my Vs stupid, but I put you on the Uber (skurt)
Two hundred on the dash, V12, how I maneuver (haan)
Ice on the hookah, neck looking like a jeweler

[Hook: Dave East & French Montana]
If it's 'bout a bag, I maneuver (I maneuver)
I'm on the hand-to-hand maneuver (I maneuver)
Fresh up out the trap, I maneuver (I maneuver)
In that foreign, I maneuver

[Post-Hook: Dave East & French Montana]
VVSes on me, keep my weapon on me
Patek Philippe (yeah), my bitch a freak (yeah)
Now tell me how you want it, them bad bitches on it (on it)
A hundred freaks  (yeah), a hunnid Vs  (yeah)

[Verse 3: Dave East & French Montana]
It break your heart, you hear your block hatin'
11:99,  Mott Haven
Finger tips still sore from all that rock shaving (haan)
I don't associate with rats, these niggas got statements
All these diamonds on me white, no I am not racist
Grams of crates (crates), brainstorm for the grand escape (escape)Cité of Soleil, hunnid Haitians (haan)
When they changed their face, I was changing faces (faces)
Bronx to Harlem, deadly combination
I'm in Miami, with Sadé on repeat (haan)
Fifty thousand, put it under the seat (stash)
Keep a gun in my reach (strapped), walk in my shoes, couldn't fit one of my sneaks
I graduated from the corner, got my hustlers degree, let's eat

[Bridge: French Montana (Dave East)]
My lawyer from the Jerusalem hit the trial with maces (ahh)
Lacking green stop your circulation (ahh)
Everyday on Remy, thuggacation (ahh)
Celebration to the fiends that helped built the nation (ahh)

[Hook: Dave East  & French Montana]
If it's 'bout a bag, I maneuver (I maneuver)
I'm on the hand-to-hand maneuver (I maneuver)
Fresh up out the trap, I maneuver (I maneuver)
In that foreign, I maneuver

[Post-Hook: Dave East & French Montana]
VVSes on me, keep my weapon on me
Patek Philippe (yeah), my bitch a freak (yeah)
Now tell me how you want it, them bad bitches on it (on it)
A hundred freaks  (yeah), a hunnid Vs  (yeah)

[Outro: French Montana]
Haan, yeah, your bitch a freak, yeah
Yeah, you niggas sweet, yeah
Harlem Bronx deadly combination
Fiends helped built the nation
Grams to the crates
The grand escape
