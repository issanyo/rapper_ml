[Intro: Styles P]
My block, we got everything
Coke, dope, smoke pills
My block, we got everything
Bootleg phones, computers
My block, we got everything
Cars, hoes, cameras
My block, we got everything
Welfare cards, everything
Let's go

[Verse 1: Styles P]
He's on that East shit, yeah, specifically New York (Specifically)
Niggas know he rhyme well, but he don't like to talk
He don't like foul shit, and rap is like ball (Fact)
Hit you with the hawk if I ain't got the fourth
Hit you with the Gemstar if I ain't got the hawk
From the land of the lost, where we in and outta court
Shoot shit like it's a sport, niggas hustle from them shores
Keep the hammer in your parka, if you parked by the court
I'm on the back block, then it's layin' on the porch
'Cause I'm probably drunk as shit, when I'm sippin' on the quart
Lil' homie got the burner, and he'll let that shit scorch
We don't give a fuck, you would swear we was raised wrong
Momma did good, but I need that money yay-long
Homie got a key flip, homie got a lick line
All I need's a mask and a scale, I'ma get mine
Sittin' in that [?] six, lookin' big time, nigga

[Chorus: Dave East]
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Nina throw a couple at you, still I love my eight shot
Pistol at the dice game, bet I make the bank stop
Razor in my North Face, thirty-eight under my tank top (Special)
Homicide rate gon' rise the same day that this tape drop
Five times a day I pray, just me and Allah talk
I ain't have a car, smokers tried to sell me a car part
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk
On Instagram, they postin' hard, meet 'em and they talk soft
Thots, we at the Ramada, models, we at the Waldorf
Get nervous when I see cops, from the dirt, D-Block
This CL Smooth, tryna get high, we got that Pete Rock
Them niggas killed my cousin so won't nothin' make the beef stop
Even your mom see, nigga, I'm concrete, you sheetrock
Cops tried to line us, they stashed coke on the weed block
That Bent' was goin' down, ain't have to meet Joc
They indicted like three spots

[Chorus: Dave East]
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
My block, we got everything, shit remind you of Walmart
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk
Tell my secrets to my dog, I never heard a dog talk
