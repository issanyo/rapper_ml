[Intro: Dave East]
Speedin'
Nym what up
Harlem
You know

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Clicquot and Henn in my glass, she po' my drink up
My jeweler flooded some cubans, he told me link up
Paranoia all in my backwood, I roll that stink up
'Least two grams up in each blunt
Remember wakin' up in the projects like "damn we stuck"
Take my daughter to Disney cause I ain't get to do teacups
When you broke you get so excited when you get free stuff
Same ones voted for Trump the same ones that locked Meech up
Scrappy that's my loc from Grape Street, I'm screamin' "free cuz"
Tangerine big body beamer with the peach cuts
Pateks, Audemars, and Rollies, we ain't tryna see cuffs
Do a lot for these niggas, it never seem to mean much
Fuck it though, we down in the 4th I'ma pick my team up
It feel like it's the 4th of July we light the scene up
Freddy never scared me, reality fucked my dreams up
I'm speedin' through the industry, 'All My Life' - they can't keep up
Think you bout to die that's when you start talkin' to Jesus
Freeze up all in my pieces, diamonds on all my nieces
Duckin' precints in New York
You could get left, niggas is leavin'
Lose your life cause you livin'
They can't find a better reason
I'm timeless every season
Rewind this if you don't believe 'em

[Chorus: Nym Lo]
I got my foot on the gas they say I'm speedin'
Headed to an early grave well I got reasons
Every single night I'm gettin drunk and weeded
Only the lord knows how much I need it
I lost some friends but I ain't never tell their secrets
Soon as I turn my back they mouth is leakin'
I just wanna sell these drugs all weekend
Middle fingers to the judge and fuck the precinct

[Verse 2: Nym Lo]
Throw me to the wolves, come back I'm leadin' the pack
2018 7 series Beamer in black
Remote control park with reclinin' seats in the back
The way I run through hundreds I need to be on the track
Cause I Husain Bolt through these dollars
Flow Joe through the dough
Michael Johnson through Jacksons
I'm not just rappin'
Trips to Saks Fifth with that money from under mattress
Cause my daughters want Monclers they send us over from Mackage
Speedin' through, beamer coupe
Color greenish-blue
Waitin' on Killa Season 2
I'm tryna see what Flea gon' do
Critics say all I rap about is drugs and vehicles
And all my money missions and exactly how I see them through
See it's true
All I really talk about is money cause all I wanna talk about is money
You don't hear me though
Pop some Belly
Rest in peace Delly I love your soul
Just ask God to let me in when it's my time to go

[Chorus: Nym Lo]
I got my foot on the gas they say I'm speedin'
Headed to an early grave well I got reasons
Every single night I'm gettin drunk and weeded
Only the lord knows how much I need it
I lost some friends but I ain't never tell their secrets
Soon as I turn my back they mouth is leakin'
I just wanna sell these drugs all weekend
Middle fingers to the judge and fuck the precinct
