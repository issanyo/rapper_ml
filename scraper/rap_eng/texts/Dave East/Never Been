[Verse 1: Dave East]
Uh
Our life was never borin'
Every 5 dollars counted, shit that sandwich was important
I love my niggas, understand it how I call it
Loc 'till I'm dead, like eggs we would scramble every mornin'
Holla at red, LAX, we landin' at 4
Me and Loc use to stand by the store
Hope the cameras was off
I did my own dirt, puttin' all of my own work
How much I could make off of these grams? That was my homework
You can't understand the highway 'till you hit the road first
Thinkin' I was a draft pick the minute I had that growth spurt
Same nigga played the corner, bodega with no shirt
Sunflower seeds and Sour Patches, I was askin'
For extensions on the rent, now it's designer fabric (designer)
Couldn't sit on auntie furniture, if not the plastic (we couldn't )
Really gotta be out your mind to survive the madness
It ain't hard to buy a boat, it's hard to find a captain
It ain't hard to find the smoke, it just depend who askin' (who want it?)
I gave hope to every block that's in upper Manhattan (Harlem)
We gave dough burn the tips, I use to light my baggies (burner)
Don't focus on us, focus on keepin' wifey happy

[Chorus: Dave East]
If you my nigga, you ain't ever gotta question it
I give you my last, I think my heart too big to measure it
Step on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit
Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been
If you my nigga, you ain't ever gotta question it
Step on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit
Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been

[Verse 2: Dave East]
It was so real, breakfast lunch and dinner was oatmeal
I don't drink soda but I'm so familiar with coke deals
They robbed him when he bought it, ain't get to see how that coat feels
Might not know her name but I could tell you how her throat feels
You don't really know me, you ain't know me when I sold pills
Bubb told me don't pour it up if it ain't got no seal
Chill never paid the bills, mental racin' still
Had no TV, now I pay multiple cable bills
I remember Malil tellin' me, "Take the wheel"
Back when Freekey told me rap they probably gonna make a deal
[?] I hate the way it make me feel
If my niggas slidin', I'm slidin', I really played the field
We got felonies but jealously can never break us
Talked to Drizzy up in Toronto, I'm missin' hella paper
Most of my niggas do biz chasin' money, go up north and get big
Might come home to no crib
We got parole on us, walk with the heat, we keep the stove on us
NYPD just pray that I get pulled with old warrants
If you told on us, on God, you broke the code on us
5 in the mornin', in your momma crib with no warnin'

[Chorus: Dave East]
If you my nigga you ain't ever gotta question it
I give you my last, I think my heart too big to measure it
Step on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit
Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been

[Outro: Dave East]
If you my nigga you ain't ever gotta question it
Step on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit
Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been
Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been
Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been
Tryna take my niggas to all the places they never been
