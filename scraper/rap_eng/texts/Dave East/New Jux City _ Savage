(Hook)
I got to know
They say’in we got a flow (got a flow)
Street made me a savage
Hundred karats on all of my rocks is cold (Lighter!)
Walk’in through to them projects, see my pockets
Nigga don’t try me though (yeah!)
Ass bang’in she ride me slow
I don’t cook but nigga I be loaded (loaded)

I got to know
They say’in we got a flow (got a flow)
Street made me a savage
Hundred karats on all of my rocks is cold (a hundred)
Walk’in through to them projects, see my pockets
Nigga don’t try me though (you see it)
Ass fat she ride me slow
I don’t kush but nigga I be low (low)

(Verse 1: Dave East)
I’m rid’in slow
Watch’in blocks as my products go
Summer time but they buy that snow
Got a hundred nines for my rider’s door (nine)
Hit the bay where that ganja grow
Always in motion, you stop and go
My main approach is get a lot of dough
Bang the toast if she try to stop my flow (brrr)

Hundreds of dollars in my Nike box
Clean all my Jordan’s with tooth brushes
Go to the store I need two dutches
To go get to work I took two buses (backwoods)

(Verse 2: Dave East)
It’s time to blow
Super high but I’m rid’in low
It was 88 buy my momma knew
She birth a king and only time with show (king)
The fuck you ly’in fo
Them Ben Franks what niggas be die’in fo
In the jungle where the lions go
My shit ain’t wrinkled got the iron know

I’m aim’in to kill even gangsta’s get killed
Order my food and can pay for my bill
Can’t go to sleep proly take me a pill
We stay in the field, my blocker go

(Hook)
I got to know (yeah)
Gangsta say’in we got a flow (got a flow)
Street made me a savage
Hundred karats on all of my rocks are cold (Lighter!)
Walk’in through to them projects, see my pockets
Nigga don’t try me though (yeah!)
Ass fat she ride me slow
I don’t cook but nigga I be loaded (loaded)

I got to know (yeah)
They say’in we got a flow (got a flow)
Street made me a savage
Hundred karats on all of my rocks are cold (Lighter!)
Walk’in through to them projects, see my pockets
Nigga don’t try me though (yeah!)
Ass fat she ride me slow
I don’t kush but nigga I be low (low)
