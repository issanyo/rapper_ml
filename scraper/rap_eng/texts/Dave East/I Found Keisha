[Verse]
Interrogations got my mental racing
I ain't tryna end up in Bellevue as no mental patient
See the plan was let's set a schedule, Tim from the other side had it
Tim was into the flashing, sold his sour and caskets
It's systematic, every Thursday night he would re-up
Navy blue Infiniti tinted, rolling his weed up
Anytime he felt he was followed it made him speed up
He rarely cracked a smile, his demeanor was always G'd up
Knew this chick that was mutual, every Monday they'd meet up
Quick visits, he'd drop off a bag, she got her feet up
Tim paid the rent to the apartment, it's in shorty name
Shorty name? I'll get to that later, to me they all the same
My cousin James called my phone, told me it's urgent
He scoped the situation out, timing had to be perfect
Worthless feelings building inside the mother of Tim's kids
He got two boys plus she know where all of his friends live
We found the weakness in his platoon, it's goon weather
Hoodies only do dark colors, it help us move better
I told James, "Cuz you know what to do if you catch her"
Might've took a loss, will I lose? Never, that's fool's treasure
We gon' do this right, we ain't the type that's too extra
It's Sunday night, James got the drop on the meeting time
Monday came, Tim switched cars, nothing police could find
I'm on standby, James supposed to come pick me up
He said "At three, that Tim meeting shorty, something he picking up"
James ain't got no kids or no wifey so he don't give a fuck
James remember when I had called him, glad that he picked it up
(Hello?) I told him I woke up, Rollie missing (word?)
"Shit had me sick cuz, ready to make my home the prison
She had her Gram deleted morning after I got robbed
Since then I been looking for her, I treat it like a job"
James took a picture and sent it, asked me who is it
I text him and I told him, no question, she look familiar
Fifteen thousand, the Rollie and a couple chains
Charged it to the game but something was on my brain
Couldn't figure it out, I'm thinking like Tim lying
James peeped one of Tim's sons walking with mommy
He thinking put him in the trunk and then he lit a blunt
He getting antsy, he been sitting on this lick all month
He ain't bother them, more concerned with they father than 'em
James parked in the complex, shawty walking in
Black leggings, leather jacket, and some black shades
Shorty five seven, few days earlier she got braids
Ever since I got robbed, riding 'round in a hot rage
Don't even care if I get locked up 'til I'm my pops' age
James called me one more time, Tim pulled up by himself
He parked and walked in the building, and then he checked his mail
James a face Tim ain't never seen, shorty and Tim
Up in the crib, this nigga fell asleep
James knocked twice, nobody answered so he picked the lock
Cut the lights, took his shoes off, walked around in his socks
Shorty in the bathroom, wine glass and red wine
Tim got missed calls from his sons before they bedtime
James opened the door, it's steaming, whole mirror foggy
Shorty in the tub, James 'bout to leap, he feeling froggy
Soon as she see him, two shots, right in the forehead
Silencer kept the blood neat, ain't leave the floor red
Slid out, Tim still sleeping, he never woke up
James had some powder to make him think Tim was coked up
Leather bag, iPhones, chains, and the Rolex
Fifteen thousand in hundreds and fifties, took no less
Tim stretched out so James looked through his phone
Searched through all the dressers, exploring all through the home
A couple of text messages, saw the name Keish
"Wait a minute, that's that same bitch that robbed East"
James ran out, jumped in the car, relit the blunt up
The sun up, kids going to school, think I might come up
Keisha found in a pool of blood, James got one up
I owe you nigga
