Put 'em on a real nigga diet, somethin' she gotta taste
Watching my money grow, play the bungalow, that's my hideaway (I'm up)
10 years ago, I was dreaming (dreaming) that I was touring
Head to ankle Ralph Lauren (hold on), these rap niggas wild boring

Crown on me, I don't claim king, just run the town homie
At the lounge doly, hoodie low, don't need the crowd on me
