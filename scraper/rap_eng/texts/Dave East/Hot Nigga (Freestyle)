[Verse 1]
(Jahlil Beats, holla at me)
I got the yola, bakin soda need a pot nigga
I could hit you from the roof, you in that drop nigga
No love life, this thug life, I feel like Pac nigga
Like fuck the man, I tuck them grams up in my sock nigga
In CT like [?] we used to move the rock
Free my youngin Trav they said he tried to shoot a cop
They washed up, I clean em all don't make me use a mop
The D's raided so we set up in a newer spot
Runnin through the kush I light the sour up
Leave a nigga soakin wet, shoot the shower up
Block on fire, NYPD put that tower up
Project nigga rippin hood rats, now I model fuck
Trappin like the 80's think I'm rich in Porter
Black Rollz drop now I could hit ya daughter
Loc up in the kitchen tryna whip a quarter
Charlie locked in Jacksonville, I'm tryna get to Florida
On Freaky I'm the hottest nigga on the earth
Ain't had a job in years but shit I'm goin to work
Me an Druggy talkin murder probably on a perc
You was with him a day ago now he on your shirt
Niggas on the east say "East you needa blow"
Molly powda and Dasani got me tweakin hoe
Disrespectin [?] you get Peter Rolled
I seen 2 niggas get stretched out like a week ago
1199, they with helicopters
My nigga took me to his trunk and showed me hella choppas
We played riverbank, grillin steak and got hella lobster
I'm from the border whatever you order niggas got it
Runnin through these streets with the mac out
Called [Litho?] he told me meet him at Mack house
Any beat I ever get on Imma black out
If it's that time of month, suck me till I pass out
I been sellin Diesel since '00 nigga
Dave East I come from public housin nigga
Get out my face I need some space don't ever crowd a nigga
Shouts to my DC bitch, fuck that Howard nigga
And to my niggas free Charlie hoe
Someway, free Bully hoe
.45 under my hoodie hoe
Don't make me put your name on this bullet yo
Pull it yo, you pulled it out but scared to pull it though
This nine'll turn them braids into a mullet though
A lotta nights was spent in bookin' though
Shouts to my niggas out in Brooklyn hoe
We gon' pull up like we workin out
I text John told him send a package of purple out
The devil got me couldn't tell you what that church about
Beefin in my city, I'm partying with the burner out
