(Verse: Styles P)
Hope these lil’ niggas done heard of me
Got the hammer hittin’ they vertebrae
You think I mean a gun, I mean a real hammer
I got nails, I’ma bring lil’ niggas to surgery
Barbaric, you all hear it
He’s so foul, he might bring a gun and lick shots at the pallbearers
That’s the old Ghost, they say the new one cool
Killa, 718 and the 212
And the 914, any area code
You a double player, make the chick carry the load
And then carry the load
I got a wife in the streets, yeah, I married ‘em both
Hip-Hop and the hammer, yeah, I carried ‘em both
No butter, nigga, I suggest you carry the toast
Watchin’ Vito and Carlito from LOX
We are considered the dark Beatles
Came a long way from duckin’ the park needles
Sand and Sorato(?), Southside, nigga
Foot on the gas, motto is to outride niggas
‘Cause the truth ain’t never have to outlie niggas
Kill a top five, you ain’t got to doubt mine, niggas
Still got work coming up ‘round nine niggas
Told the ‘hood that I’m back, they said “’Bout time, nigga”
Light up the gas so we can hit cloud nine, niggas

(Verse: Dave East)
Blocks been shot up, they scared to walk through ‘em
Caught a body young, some niggas was scared to talk to ‘em
That was my man, you know how life curve
I was into Polo then he put me on to Iceberg
Beg my Ma for that sweater with Snoopy on it
Seen Biggie on BET and wanted a Coogi on me
Fuck whoever you roll with, I don’t care who your homie
My lil’ homie don’t like to pass, he a shooter only
Listen, I’m from the bottom of the basement
This money is a drug, I got addicted when I taste it
I was into checks, either TD or Chase it
In Parkchester, thinkin’ of a way to get this bracelet
So many rumors when your name get lit
The ones saying they did the most ain’t did shit
Got caught with a couple chicks and my name got picked
I’m the hottest nigga spitting for niggas ain’t got shit
Older niggas say I’m nice, they respect how I came in
All money ain’t good money, move when it makes sense
Hit the bar daily, I got New York on my back, nigga
Skinny body walk with a big gun, make ‘em act bigger
Broke but on Instagram, everybody act richer
Pack flipper
Three bitches, that’s company, I’m Jack Tripper
P watchin’ Carlito, I’m watchin’ Godfather
Phone died talkin’ to the plug, ain’t have a car charger
Had the 6th floor bumpin’ like acne
Put these Louboutins on and take it to (?), exactly

(Verse: Nino Man)
They see me all on the scene
It was only a dream
Gotta go through the struggle just to know what I mean
15, bang bang, I’m addicted to green
Posted up, real shit, this ain’t a meme
I was only a teen gettin’ money tryna stay out the way
But these sucka niggas never wanna stay in they place
So I’m straight
They just horsin’ around so hey
I’m OK, hope you still look the same at your wake
Better pray ‘fore the tech spray ya
We will literally x-ray ya
That’s why my team got the best players
I was taught to stack bread, talkin’ is cheap
Now my money do the talkin’, now they openly speak
I be runnin’ shit when you can barely walk in the streets
Since you preaching, hope your coffin is free
‘Cause we aim at foreheads
We pour lead, make sure they all dead
More spread, I got it in a Jiffy like cornbread
Cross me, nigga dead meat like Boar’s Head
You fronted out the blue, I left him and the floor red
Showed ‘em love, they started plottin’ ‘em
I’m fuckin’ mamis  in (?) like I’m platinum
I ain’t signed to a major yet but I’m poppin ‘em
They jockin ‘em
We not related, stop it bro
This is my reality
Fuck if niggas mad at me
