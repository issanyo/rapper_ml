[Intro]
I surprised myself
I'm still here
Street nigga

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I take your bitch on vacation
Just the potential I'm cakin'
Check my credentials, no statements
Roll down the window and blaze 'em
Way before I use the hashtag
Stomach shot make him a patient
Chip bag, that nigga wasted
Smoke big bags, I look asian
I don't understand that other shit
I don't tell bitches my government
I jump the fence from the government
My cousin took cent from the government
I don't really know you niggas
We can never be on brother shit
Devil tryna take me under
I come from the gutter, fuck it though I love this shit
I could never-ever love a bitch
Lately niggas on some funny shit
Yeezy's on, doin' the money dance
Too much paper for a money clip
We just fuckin', that's my honey dip
.45 with the rubber grip
Make a nigga do a summersault
I don't trust not one of y'all
In the trap, made 100 calls
Now my section got 100 broads
Since a youngin' I just want to ball
Bags comin' and I want 'em all
Bags comin' and I got to get 'em
He with the plug, got a guala with 'em
Remember he ain't had a dollar with 'em
I don't think they want no problems with 'em

[Verse 2: Kur]
I just got some red (?)
Bitches tryna kick it, think I shot a chicken
Bought my momma house, white picket fences
Show her somethin' different
She knew I was different
She knew I was gifted
Think about it now I was out there trippin'
I was on my grind
I was takin' panties, take it how you get it
I ain't frontin' for no motherfuckin' bitches
I know (?) grantin' all my wishes
Rent was doin' heavy (?) down to kick it
(?) niggas pay attention
Anything I rapped about I really lived it
Takin' money, pull off
I done did it
Can't cross back
You done burned your bridges
I just hop out
I was jumpin' fences
When I used to have the Camry it was simple
Eatin' shrimp rolls, I was in the trenches
Way before I had fame I had a pistol
Tryna get her name, shawty gon' diss me
Now she wanna text me, sayin' that she miss me
Man that bitch is dizzy
Throw that (?)
Shit I never do and I fuckin' did it
All this shit I gotta do
All this shit I gotta do

[Bridge]
I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
Yeah, I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all

[Hook: Dave East]
I don't trust not one of y'all
In the trap, made 100 calls
Now my section got 100 broads
Since a youngin' I just want to ball
I don't trust not one of y'all
In the trap, made 100 calls
Now my section got 100 broads
Since a youngin' I just want to ball

[Bridge]
I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
Yeah, I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
I don't trust not one of y'all
