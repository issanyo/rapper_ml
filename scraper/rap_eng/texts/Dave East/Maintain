[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
Young nigga growin' up, now I just wear plain jane
Them niggas ain't built like us, them niggas lame, lame (bitch!)
Money keep calling my line, just tell 'em the same thing (brrr)
Only break bread with my niggas, huh, gang gang
Do it for the block young nigga, for the block young nigga, gang gang
I was just focused, I was tryna get it, I was tryna maintain
These niggas bogus, they be gettin' over, they be playin' fame games
I still feel the same pain

[Verse 1: Bino Rideaux]
I hop in that coupe and I can't hear the motor, I can't feel the lane change
What happened to real niggas come first, explain things
I'm tryna keep consistent with the shit they tell me that the fame change
Niggas was with me, they be feelin' different 'bout this shit 'til change came
Find me a bitch that never really been nowhere and take her way, way
Ain't got no time for nothin' when you live life around the bank, Chase
Can't take these bitches too serious, these bitches just play, pay
Young nigga made me, count up the day to day

[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
Young nigga growin' up, now I just wear plain jane
Them niggas ain't built like us, them niggas lame, lame (bitch!)
Money keep calling my line, just tell 'em the same thing (brrr)
Only break bread with my niggas, huh, gang gang
Do it for the block young nigga, for the block young nigga, gang gang
I was just focused, I was tryna get it, I was tryna maintain
These niggas bogus, they be gettin' over, they be playin' fame games
I still feel the same pain

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I still feel the same thing
We can't leave no witness, I don't want to hit it, I just want some brain brain
Niggas keep talkin' 'bout they gettin' money, them niggas is lame, lame
Before all these foreigns I wasn't important was hoppin' the train, train
Where I'm from you either slang 'caine, play a sport or go and gang bang
I did all three, I came right out of jail, then that's when my lane changed
I got this guap, it's fallin' out my pockets, you try me and I blew the same thing
Already bust the Patek down, it's time to go pick up the plain jane
I be in hoods where you can't hang, throw up my hood, nigga gang gang

[Chorus: Bino Rideaux]
Young nigga growin' up, now I just wear plain jane
Them niggas ain't built like us, them niggas lame, lame (bitch!)
Money keep calling my line, just tell 'em the same thing (brrr)
Only break bread with my niggas, huh, gang gang
Do it for the block young nigga, for the block young nigga, gang gang
I was just focused, I was tryna get it, I was tryna maintain
These niggas bogus, they be gettin' over, they be playin' fame games
I still feel the same pain
