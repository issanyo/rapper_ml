Murder on the beat
Let's go

[Vado]
Shout out all my exes get your brag on
Ya' Chanel, ya Celina mean bag on
Get your swag on, if he don't act right
I'ma act wrong cause you was that type
To put me back on, real one
Fuck how them niggas feel they wasn't worth a chill
They wasn't worth a meal, when they paying a bill
YSL is ya heel know you better than that
And you never was wack always ahead of ya pack
You was something to chase that flew up in the ranks
Used to run in the banks I give you nothing but thanks
Every color in cakes, pump, pump it up
Partin open the gate tell home come with a lake
It ain't over you wait, girl you know you a star
And wore no push up bras, wore you a Audemars
Bartenders they know where we are
They know where it's dough ain't gotta blow at their bar
They just go to the car then we going across
Stones going across like Jesus go on the cross
I can tell you sad, ya glowing is off
You know that you hot that's why I be blowing you off
Cause you a vet ma, love how you flex ma
Pushing a Vette ma, hoodie is Vetemonts
Gucci tights and heels, Amari sweats huh
No effort to dress huh, I'm definitely impressed

I be out in LA with my connections
Bottles of Belair, hoes in my section
I won't lighten up on these niggas
Cause niggas ain't nice enough for me nigga
I been a beast, heavy orders for weeks
Breaking quarters for cheap, on these corners and street
Shit every morning was sweet
Last winter brought a mink for my daughter and niece
Once I caught it in beat, shit I'mma throw it to East

[Dave East]
These hoes, ya boy
Ya boy! Better be nice to me
You shittin' me
If we talking about women I keep a bad one
Mami a freak, you can't relate if you ain't never had one
She told me you acting light skin we just be fucking
I can't be wifing, always texting me she keep typing
Her ex from Harlem she told me he went to Rykes
And I been moving so trifling, fucking everything moving
I'm breaking nights my aura converting dykes
We fucked, what's the price off the Migo album
Miami not like Barbados she never seen the island
She tried to ask me bout paper told her I keep it piling
I might even eat it long as you keep it silent
Got the nerve to tell me she gotta be nice for what
I ain't want you anyway, I just liked ya butt
Acting all stuck up ain't living life enough
Tryna be all in our section you bouta spend the night with us
Uh middle of the summer we keeping it calm
With a chick like Stacey Dash or Lela Rochon
Full length in the winter that shit be keeping her warm
Panties get pulled to the side, fuck and she keepin 'em on
After the neck I got respect I might speak to her mom
Said she from Highbridge I caught her creeping with Don
She got everything Gucci said that she need some Vuitton
She know the kid rich, might new freezer her arm

Told me she stressed out just need to smoke one
She got her nails did, she got her toes done
She told me life been rough with these niggas
She pour a cup and light the fuck off the liquor
I understand
