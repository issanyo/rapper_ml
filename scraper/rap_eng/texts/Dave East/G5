[Intro: Dave East]
Fred the Godson
Yo Nas signed me I'm with God's Son

[Chorus: Fred the Godson]
I'm fly like a G5
My chrome mac cost a G, 5
I mack like a G, 5
Out of 8 bitches here, I could G 5
What up blood? Tell that nigga I'm a G, 5
I got Crips on call for a G 5
Benz truck, coming in a G5
TBM Blockwork, that's how we ride

[Verse 1: Fred the Godson]
I bought a watch off these sumo bars
I show the band in my videos, Bruno Mars
You know God, I skip to the whip
Reverse then draw fours like Uno cards
The city hard, oh well check 'em
You can die here like Odell Beckham
Cooking in the kitchen he cheffing
Razor blade sitting in the key, ref calling 3 seconds
It's evidence Fred
Crew move weight that's definite bread
That water boy Boucher, residents dead
So y'all have to pay like the Presidents head
This for the block while it sizzle
I shoot off the pick, shit I never could dribble
The brick little, but got a thick middle
Bread always come back sweet, McGriddle

[Chorus: Fred the Godson]
I'm fly like a G5
My chrome mac cost a G, 5
I mack like a G, 5
Out of 8 bitches here, I could G 5
What up blood? Tell that nigga I'm a G, 5
I got Crips on call for a G 5
Benz truck, coming in a G5
TBM Blockwork, that's how we ride

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I'm Raekwon when it come to cheffin'
This 911 got nothing to do with 9/11
That Porsche remind me of Heaven
It's cloudy blue, off coca I copped the Audi coupe
[?] physical even Mystikal know I'm bout it fool
No limit, them hoes grinning, Dolce Gabbana fitted
See that red stripe that mean Prada did it, I gotta spend it
Balling in New York like Kenny Anderson or Rod Strickland
Talking bout that package in my bedroom, my mom listening
Fred the Godson, yo Nas signed me I'm with God's Son
Niggas had on the Pelle's couldn't afford it tried to rob one
[?] with water, you drown pinching bags
Almost a quarter an ounce, can't leave my lawyer with doubt
Put collect call to Papi before we called it a drought
Hardest out of my city fuck these niggas talking about
Baddest bitch in the club I got shooter walking her out
So love Atlanta got me targeting south, Harlem no doubt

[Chorus: Fred the Godson]
I'm fly like a G5
My chrome mac cost a G, 5
I mack like a G, 5
Out of 8 bitches here, I could G 5
What up blood? Tell that nigga I'm a G, 5
I got Crips on call for a G 5
Benz truck, coming in a G5
TBM Blockwork, that's how we ride
