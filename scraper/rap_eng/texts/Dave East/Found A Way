[Intro]
I found a way
It was so hard to get what I wanted, I found a way
I had to sacrifice for this life, I found a way
(Switch my whole life up)

[Chorus]
I found a way
It was so hard to get what I wanted, I found a way (found a way)
I had to sacrifice for this life, I found a way (found a way)
Got sick and tired of wearin' the same clothes, I found a way (found a way)
Got tired of seein' the same hoes, I found a way (found a way)
I found a way
Any drug, any plug on deck, if you come around the way
I got dimes on the way
Ain't got time for no games
Just wanna shine like a chain
I'm out my mind, out my brain (brain)
From the grind came the fame (fame)
20-thousand in my back pocket, sorry nigga, I ain't got the change
(I ain't got it)
Niggas that I grew up with, hate me more than ever
Charge it to the game (uh)
I just play the back seat, gettin' top, while the driver switch lanes

[Bridge 1]
It was so hard to get what I wanted, I found a way (found a way)
I had to sacrifice for this life, I found a way (found a way)
Got sick and tired of wearin' the same clothes, I found a way (found a way)
Got sick and tired of seein' the same hoes, I found a way (found a way)
I found a way, I found a way
Any drug, any plug on deck, come around the way
I got dimes on the way
Ain't got time for da' games (no time)
Just wanna shine like a chain (shine)
I'm out my mind, out my brain
From the grind came the fame
20-thousand in my back pocket, sorry nigga, I ain't got the change

[Verse 1]
Run up on me, must be out your brain
You and I, we are not the same
Ain't say a word, when the cops a' came
Money comin', shit you gotta change
Hardest young nigga out the game
Watch my aim, got a hundred clip
Movin' like I'm on the wanted list
I'm on a yacht, with a hundred Crips
I ain't bitchin', shit, I wanted this
Jump out in Louis Vuitton
White tee, black leather jacket, like I'm cool with The Fonz
Fuck the ring, kiss the shoe of a don
Hundred p's, I could move 'em tomorrow

[Bridge 2: Dave East & D'anna Stewart]
It was so hard to get what I wanted, I found a way
(found a way)
I had to sacrifice for this life, I found a way
(found a way)
Got sick and tired of wearin' the same clothes, I found a way
(I-I-I-I-I)
Got sick and tired of seein' the same hoes, I found a way
(y-e-e-a-a-a-h)
I found a way
(found a way, found a way)
Any drug, any plug on deck, if you come around the way
I got dimes on the way
Ain't got time for no games
Just wanna shine like a chain
I'm out my mind, out my brain
From the grind came the fame (find a way)
20-thousand in my back pocket, sorry nigga, I ain't got the change
Niggas that I grew up with, hate me more than ever
Charge it to the game
I just play the back seat, gettin' top, while the driver switch lanes
Pull up, new Maserati
I ain't touch her body, but the bitch came
20-thousand in my back pocket, sorry nigga, I ain't got the change
Niggas that I grew up with, hate me more than ever
Charge it to the game
I just play the back seat, gettin' top, while the driver switch lanes
Pull up, new Maserati
I ain't touch her body, but the bitch came

[Outro: Dave East]
I found a way
It was so hard to get what I wanted, I found a way
I had to sacrifice for this life, I found a way
Got sick and tired of wearin' the same clothes, I found a way
Got sick and tired of seein' the same hoes, I found a way
I found a way
I found a way
I found a way
It was so hard, I found a way
It was so hard to get what I wanted, I found a way
I found a way
