I done been through everything but death
I done gave my all till I had nothing left
I done took a thousand pills for stress
I done been through a lot of shit to get to where Im at(x2)

Just to get to where I'm at
I done been through a lot of shit to get to where I'm at(x2)

Before I had a package on my waistline
I use to crossover spin baseline robbed him for his re-up in the daytime
Use to have the guns in the bodega
Same ones I couldn't get a chrome from askin for favors
Grey diamonds, black ski mask
Like a fan of the raiders
I call Carl like look I got some raw lets get this paper
The blog sites loving me
Complexes to the fader
Bitches say I'm they favourite
Me and trey was just in Vegas
Thinking bout all the mornings I was sleeping they was rating
Perc 30s off the wake up
Use to have me moving zombie like
Xannys had me feelin like I forgot how to ride a bike
Paranoia naturally in us cause we can die tonight
Still screaming fuck a cop
Sippin blue Hawaiian from the butter spot
Tryna get that Audi coloured butterscotch
Cuzzo pumpin butter rock
Hard yellow, had the Knicks like Carmelo
If you want the dimes or the dubs hit the other block

I done been through everything but death
I done gave my all till I had nothing left
I done took a thousand pills for stress
I done been through a lot of shit to get to where Im at(x2)

Just to get to where I'm at
I done been through a lot of shit to get to where I'm at(x2)
