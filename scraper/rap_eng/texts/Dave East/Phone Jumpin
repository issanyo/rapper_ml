[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yeahhh-ha-ha
There we go
Ha ha ha
(Renegade)
Ha ha ha ha

[Hook: Dave East]
Residue still on my hand
It feel like I'm back in the kitchen (I'm back)
Your bitch in the back of the Fisker
You can't imagine the trenches (Nah)
What you know about trappin' and pitchin'?
Now I got 'em laughin' up in the back of the Bentley
What you know about not havin' a penny?
Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Phone off, it was quiet for me (Quiet)
Don't say you love me, you ain't dyin' for me
I woke up this morning with a lot of money
I'm just sellin' game, come and buy it from me
On my mama, your honor, I'm not gonna speak on a soul
They told me you reap what you sow
Profit's my nigga, I'll never forget all the times
He took me where I needed to go (Uh)
I woke this mornin', like, "Fuck everybody,"
And that's how I knew that I needed to smoke (Uh)
My niggas is felons, you niggas is jealous
And y'all just definin' the meaning of broke (Uh)
I'm gettin' some brain, I pulled out my chain
And she started lookin' like she seen a ghost  (Ah!)
Diamonds is cold like goin' outside with no jacket
And mama say you need a coat  (Huh)
I do not wanna be stuck in the hood all day
I rather go jump off a boat
"When the album droppin'?" All they wanna know
Two thousand for this Moncler coat
Mike Amiri cost me eighteen
That ain't no shirt, that was straight jeans
Pineapple Fanta when I be on it
But my little bitch she drinking straight lean (Uh)

[Hook: Dave East]
Residue still on my hand
It feel like I'm back in the kitchen
Your bitch in the back of the Fisker (In the back)
You can't imagine the trenches (Nah)
What you know about trappin' and pitchin'?
Now I got 'em laughin' up in the back of the Bentley
What you know about not havin' a penny? (Uh uh)
Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Ice hash in the bong
Take dabs till I'm gone
In the basement, growing base
This shit is strong like mase
Keep a low temp nail
'cause it's all about taste
I just did three mil'
Did it all in one day
Hear em talk but I don't believe 'em
New car so I'm gonna leave 'em
Talk down but they wanna be him—damn
They don't go off like Khalifa, man
Second grade, had two girlfriends
Fifth grade, I was in Japan
Now I can never go broke again
I ain't need no one to hold my hand
(Uh, fuck up off me)
If the weed good roll it then
Quick to turn a hater to a fan
Quick to get another million
Quick to spend it all with my fam
Quick to tell a nigga who I am
Quick to get my niggas out a jam
I'mma roll one
Pass it around, ain't got lungs
You better grow some
I remember people lyin' to me
Now I force em' all to stand in line
How he got a bed but he lyin'?
My nigga don't text me right now I'm too high

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Ph—
Ph—
Phone off, it was quiet for me (Quiet)
Don't say you love me, you ain't dyin' for me
I woke up this morning with a lot of money
I'm just sellin' game, come and buy it from me
On my wrist, I put Patek Philippe now (Yee)
Every day we can eat at Phillepe's now
It's hard to see through this weed cloud
I'm picking up bags when I leave town (Bags)
A lot of hammers and a lot of lead
A lot of Phantoms and a lot of red (Uh)
Without these cameras they'd be probably dead
Hard to keep my balance off a lot of meds (Woah)
I've been that nigga since Simon Says (Uh)
I heard you talk to a lot of feds (Uh)
Bring your rent back to Papi and gimme more
Fuck the re-up up at the Fendi store (Fendi)
Fuck the re-up up on Chanel
Fuck the re-up up on Vuitton
Last year I bet against the Cavaliers
I fucked the re-up on LeBron
We ain't lookin' for jobs livin' like the mob
Hot temper keepin' it calm
See I used to sleep in the slums
Now bitches chew me like a piece of some gum

[Hook: Dave East]
Residue still on my hand
It feel like I'm back in the kitchen (I'm back)
Your bitch in the back of the Fisker (In the back)
You can't imagine the trenches (Never)
What you know about trappin' and pitchin'?
Now I got 'em laughin' up in the back of the Bentley (In the back)
What you know about not havin' a penny?
Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly

[Verse 4: Dave East]
Phone off, it was quiet for me (Quiet)
Don't say you love me, you ain't dyin' for me
I woke up this mornin' with a lot of money
I'm just sellin' game, come and buy it from me (A lot)
On my wrist I put Patek Philippe now (Yeah)
Every day we can eat at Phillepe's now (Everyday)
It's hard to see through this weed cloud (Shh)
I'm picking up bags when I leave town (Bags)
A lot of hammers and a lot of lead
A lot of Phantoms and a lot of red (Uh)
Without these cameras they'd be probably dead
Hard to keep my balance off a lot of meds
(Percs, Xans, Lean, Percs, Xans...)
Without these cameras they'd be probably dead
Hard to keep my balance off a lot of meds (All the meds)

[Hook: Dave East]
Residue still on my hand (Stick)
It feel like I'm back in the kitchen (Right back)
Your bitch in the back of the Fisker
You can't imagine the trenches (Huh?)
Now I got 'em laughing up in the back of the Bentley (Ghrr!)
Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly (Bag it up)

[Outro: Dave East]
"Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly"
"Phone jumpin'—"
"Phone jumpin', gotta bag it up quickly"
