[Hook: Jacquae]
Nah, you ain't bout that
My niggas with the shits, you don't want that
One call this whole shit shut down
I'm the word around the town
Watch what you say or do
Watch what you say or do
Watch what you say or do
It's Harlem

[Verse 1: Dave East]
It ain't Halloween but the mask on
Hard to see the snakes when the grass long
Enough lies heard, you touch pies, we rough ride like Drag-On
Copping socks from crack heads that still got the tag on 'em
That liquor must've got you drunk
Bring 'em to the roof, I know you think you fly so Imma watch you jump
Give you a pack in front of your homies and watch you pump
Have a shooter posted up on any block you touch
It's the kid that's cosigned by legends
Coke lines and weapons
He want a dub, I take a dime and stretch it
Street sweeper with a broomstick
I could get your goon hit
It's sunshine, I'm ducking one time until the moon hit
You Terrance Howard, Imma play Larenz with that pool stick
Been coulda killed these niggas wait until my mood switch
Kay Slay know I spit obsession, Dope Boy George
Seat back flying up the Bruckner with a porn star

Nah, you ain't bout that
My niggas with the shits, you don't want that

Watch what you say or do
Watch what you say or do

It's Harlem

[Verse 2: Ms. Hustle]
They wanna know who that Harlem girl we all authentic
I'm bubbling like baking soda soon as the water hit it
If I ain't cop it for me better believe my daughter in it
Extorting bitches keep the order with it I call the business
See the nerve of a bunch of bitches unheard of
I get a bird off then I go visit Bergdorf's
Who referred her fuck it you know I curved her
Go and break the rules shorty and then it's murder
You ain't a killer don't believe that shorty
I looked you dead in the eyes I don't see that shorty
See I know you ain't pop, now you see that Maury
I'm like an alcoholic baby yea I keep that 40
They fronting I run 'em down
I'm hunting my gun around
Nah, we ain't playing tag don't give me the runaround
See them bitches say I slayed, you know I'm straight stunting now
Like the end of the performance, fuck it give 'em a bow
Bow

[Hook: Jacquae]
Nah, you ain't bout that
My niggas with the shits, you don't want that
One call this whole shit shut down
I'm the word around the town
Watch what you say or do
Watch what you say or do
Watch what you say or do
It's Harlem

[Verse 3: Vado]
You better warn 'em, powder and marijuana
Shooting out heavy armor, towers on every corner (Harlem)
Blowing sour from Arizona
Big yacht, boat shoes, Prada's or Ferragamo's
Mean, Big Sinatra women stare at the posture
Cashmere, Cartier, yea I'm wearing the (?)
God fearing these bars airing your roster
Call me Bob Aaron when I'm staring the boxer
Just zoom by, playing Maroon 5
Hopped out Bape sweats Jordan Maroon 5s
Big gun latex gloves when the moon rise
My crew rise leave you face down with your goon mob
I been trill since (?)
I did shit for real I hit bricks for real
While he was on the move with Dame Biggs we held enough
Don't tour much far as I go was Wales

[Hook: Jacquae]
Nah, you ain't bout that
My niggas with the shits, you don't want that
One call this whole shit shut down
I'm the word around the town
Watch what you say or do
Watch what you say or do
Watch what you say or do
It's Harlem
