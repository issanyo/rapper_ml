[Intro: Dave East]
Started with nothin'
Talkin' this, talkin' that
Talk that money, nigga!
Huh!?

[Bridge: Dave East ]
In the ghetto shit get real, I dont care how niggas feel
Heavy metal sit you still; kiss the devil in the grille
Pop a pill, smoke a blunt, take a shot, shake the spot
All these cameras make shit hot, I bet these hammers make 'em drop

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I got my shades on, and this haze strong, and them diamonds black, just like Akon
I know killers bees that's not Raekwon
Head in my lap, like her face gone
Made eight songs, that's like eights bombs
Just gotta make it, no Trey Songz
Beat knockin', that base strong
From the same town that put Ma$e on (put Ma$e on?)
And he Cam' too; I smoke bamboo til' them grams through
Stop copying what your man do
Lost count of all the bitches I ran through
O-G Kush from Oakland, take that to the head like shampoo
Grand Crew, free Max B
All this paper coming in tax free

[Hook: Dave East]
Started with a whole lotta nothing
Now I'm tryin' to take everything they got
These niggas do a whole lotta frontin'
Comin' from the bottom, starvin' to take they spot
All I wanna do is touch a million dollars 'fore the day I die
All I wanna do is touch a billion dollars 'fore the day I die
Started with a whole lotta nothing
Now I'm tryin' to take everything they got
These niggas do a whole lotta frontin'
Comin' from the bottom, starvin' to take they spot
All I wanna do is touch a million dollars 'fore the day I die
All I wanna do is touch a billion dollars 'fore the day I die

[Bridge: Dave East ]
In the ghetto shit get real, I dont care how niggas feel
Heavy metal sit you still; kiss the devil in the grille
Pop a pill, smoke a blunt, take a shot, shake the spot
All these cameras make shit hot, I bet these hammers make 'em drop

[Verse 2: GLC]
It started back on '87; I was eleven with a Mac-eleven
I was more about gettin' paper
But for the folks, I kept a weapon
Trying to flip Big Daddy Cane
Nigga wasn't no half-steppin'
Then I switch to moving green; as a teen I got connected
I hustled hard, on these [?]
At sixteen I was ownin' cars; '90 Lumina, Impala
Man, the Chi had a different meaning, when they said "shoot for the stars"
Man, it wasn't about no dreamin', it was about killin' Mars
Fucked up, when I look back, when [?] got his shit cracked
Man, we ain't had no daddy, nobody tell us to get back
All we knew was two-elevens, one-eighty-sevens, and kick-backs
Now it sucks when I'm tryin' to sleep and I'm still hearin' them click-clacks

[Hook: Dave East]
Started with a whole lotta nothing
Now I'm tryin' to take everything they got
These niggas do a whole lotta frontin'
Comin' from the bottom, starvin' to take they spot
All I wanna do is touch a million dollars 'fore the day I die
All I wanna do is touch a billion dollars 'fore the day I die
Started with a whole lotta nothing
Now I'm tryin' to take everything they got
These niggas do a whole lotta frontin'
Comin' from the bottom, starvin' to take they spot
All I wanna do is touch a million dollars 'fore the day I die
All I wanna do is touch a billion dollars 'fore the day I die

[Bridge: Dave East ]
In the ghetto shit get real, I dont care how niggas feel
Heavy metal sit you still; kiss the devil in the grille

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I don't need your handshakes and your fake love
Ya'll fake thugs, ya'll grille heat
Niggas fuck you up and then still speak
She sucked me off til' I feel weak
She nasty, but I love it
My shooter with me in public
Comin' from where the housing was public
Got myself popping, nigga, with no budget
Duckin' five-oh, so I ride slow
Smoking hydro, til' my eyes low
What it take to pull; hesitate to pull
So just save the bull for Chicago
Get wrapped up like gyro
Younger, rich, poor they flossin'
He couldn't afford a fortune, but bet he afford a coffin
Recorders oall finna catch you, so watch who you stand next to
Extended clips that'll stretch you
Shots get sent just like a bitch text you
These streets 'bout to know my story; dedication, passion and glory
Glock-nine so clutch, Rob Horry
Gators might bite; don't step on my Mauri's, nigga

[Hook: Dave East]

[Outro (talking): GLC]
Man, I feel like shit nuttier than a motherfucker at the moment, you know I'm talkin' 'bout? Motherfuckers lookin', spectulatin', and talkin' about what's goin' on in the motherfuckin' city; that's my city, you know what I'm talkin' bout? At the end of the day, this shit been goin' on, man, motherfuckers just ain't have no YouTube, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout? Shit, don't be surprised; ya'll motherfuckers took away all the motherfuckin' fathers, locked 'em up or introduced them to that motherfuckin' crack. And now here we is, God dammit; we out here like that, God dammit, at the kick-back with nobody tellin' us to get back, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout? Shit, man we gotta stop pointin' the motherfuckin' finger, man, and accept responsibility for this shit that's goin' on, boy. Man up, motherfuckin' ban up. Cathedral to the congregation. Ism!

It's Dave East and G-L-C
Shout out to all the young playas out here gettin' it
