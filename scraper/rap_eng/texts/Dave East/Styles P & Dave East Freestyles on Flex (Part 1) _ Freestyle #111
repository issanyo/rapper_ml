[Verse 1: Styles P]
They ain't tell you that New York is mine
What an awful time, pop his body then toss the nine
Don't nobody wanna cross the line, that the Ghost draw
I get stoned, you want smoke dog? I flip off like O-Dog
Beloved brothers I don't care about them other brothers
I clip your older or younger brother
But I ain't with the rah-rah life, I'm with the la-la-life
Loose shooter on the Baha bike
I'm dead wrong, you swear to god I'm right, yeah
Fuck with East get your knees broke
I run out of bars, I got Belize coke
Touch me, I get a shooter to shoot free throws
I know big MCs and big kilos
Got a old plug that Kiss know
Way out of Frisco, coke money from discos
Still box like I'm Klitschko, Crawford
I still hop out the six-o, awkward
I still fit in the mix though
Cursed but I still piss with the gift though
Yeah the brother is beloved, he ain't never been soft
He been rugged, nigga
And I been in the mob when these little niggas said they were thuggin', yeah
And these niggas said they hard but if you ask me
I think these niggas just buggin', yeah, these niggas out of place
If they get up in my face I'ma cut 'em, yeah
Ill niggas that kill niggas, not a molester, not tryin' to feel niggas
Not in the house yeah, I'm in the field niggas
Why you lyin', said you a real nigga
I got the Tommy, no not a Hilfigher, yeah
Cut the shit 'fore I cut your face with a razor that cut the brick
Have my homegirl cut your bitch, tell the label to cut the check
Or I'll fuck around and bust a clip, yeah
Beloved, nigga

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I blend in with the mobsters like I'm John Gotti
Pistol on me take that off, nah, it's an armed robbery
Don't be stupid tryin' to disarm, get harmed probably
Four-five, skin them niggas heads you'll think they all Nazi
Call papi that duffel ready to send
Play the ex, Glock on me, hoping they let me in sin
Better than them, wool varsity letterman shit
Show cash in my pics 'cause they said I'll never get rich
Talkin' all that tough shit never thought you'd ever get stripped
Actin' like a boujee bitch never thought you'd ever get pimped
Goldi in the flesh, but my braids nappy as fuck
Illuminati tried to make me a mason, Pappy what's up
Cold E riding with me, we packed the back of a truck
I found out Dre Mac came home let's run it up
Usain Bolt in my aura, 'caine cut by the quarter
Range truck just enjoy it, retain it just for the lawyer
I used to move that dust like a sandstorm
Sold smokers optimus dimes and watched them transform
I can triple anything I get my hands on
Couldn't hear this shit from nobody, had to be hands on
Violate, it's not gonna be a block safe to stand on
I'm only back in New York until my tan gone
I heard Donald Trump outlawed snitchin'
I'm knockin' 2Pac and The Outlawz, chillin', smokin' my own strand
All these drums around you think I had my own band
No pills, weed and champagne I'm a grown man
I heard Eminem album and got inspired
I don't talk too much around rappers they might be wired
I'm glad they let Kevin Gates out, I don't get tired neither
Firebreather, rappers just wanna borrow, goodbye Felicia
You're not Rick James, not Prince, you're not Aretha hot
Not in my section so don't try to reach 'em
They too high to try them, so I try to teach 'em
In that shade room y'all been doin' a lot of reachin'
I ain't talkin' good music when I say I love designer
See Gucci got my heart but sometimes I cheat with Prada
Rest in peace Malik and Mugga, I just pray they got in
Nicki tried to holla' I'm just tryin' to make my album
We dropped out, or the schools put us out
No trace like Jimmy Hoffa, know some dudes that can vouch
Move out, commando, it's militants in my posture
I'm where the water clear you can go get your own lobsters
Sauce no pasta, table settings for four mobsters, no nonsence
Attitude's obnoxious, got a million ways to get it if you family
I had the product in the Camry, sent my momma to Miami
I got fed homies and friends that work for Morgan Stanley
And Merrill Lynch too, a plug that send a brick through, uh
Avianne diamonds on my body crip blue, I push a button
Niggas get to cuttin' like they skipped school, woo
