[Chorus]
Send it up
Send it through
Send it, back to you
Send it up
Send it through
Send it, back to you

[Verse 1]
Your inner view to me is
Something that I do desire
Struggling to see a new something that I fantasize
So I'm sending

[Chorus]
Send it up
Send it through
Send it, back to you
Send it up
Send it through
Send it, back to you

[Verse 2]
You can't disguise your emotions
You know that I see in your eyes
You soul's in me, your soul's somethin that I feel inside
Run, run, run, run, if I run Lord only knows how far that I and I
Will fall behind
Gotta find a better place, find a better space
So that I, so my life may be the one reason why

[Refrain]
Tell me what will I do?
Tell me what will I do
Send it right back to you

[Bridge]
Hold on be strong, for your own
Move on before long, you'll get home
If you're feeling insecure
You can be sure, it's because
Even if it take forever and a day for me to do
I gotta send it on to you

[Refrain]
What will I do?
Tell me what will I do

[Vamp]
Send it on
Send it right back to you
Send it on
Send it on
Send it on
Whenever you want to
Send it on
When it gets cold, babe
Send it on
Cold outside
Send it on
All your dreams
Send it on
When you get lonely
Send it on
We all get lonely sometimes
Send it on
Pick up the phone
Send it on
In the morning
Send it on
Or in the evening
Send it on
And in the midnight hours
Send it on
Yeah, baby
Send it on
You can send it on, baby
Send it on
Whenever you're in need, babe
Send it on
Whenever you're in need
Send it on
Just call me baby
Send it on
Send on by-by baby
Send it on
Sometime it make me want to stop and say
Sometime
Sometime
We don't know what else to say, but
And it's alright, it's alright babe
So you know baby, we gotta get on

[Outro]
What will I do?
Tell me what will I do
Send it on back to you
Send it right back to you
