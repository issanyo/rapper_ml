Today I played it safe, cards are in my favor
Can't U leave 2 much 2 chance
Woke up with time to waver
Yesterday was crazy
Mysteries I know now, now I know
The ins and outs of things from day 2 day
That's how it goes
Don't get confused about it
Just try to do your thang
Cause in the end gotta know just how to play the game
I search for answers often
I payed the price for many
Still long for happiness
Not promised to the plenty
I've gotta go on

(Chorus)
Good days, bad days, halfway days
Good times, bad times, halfway times
Good days, bad days, halfway days
But I'm still looking for a greatdayndamornin'

Today might be the day, I get it in the pocket
Lord knows if there's an angle, gotta try 2 find it
Gotta get over, before the sun comes up
Just in case of an emergency, gotta tighten up

(Chorus)
