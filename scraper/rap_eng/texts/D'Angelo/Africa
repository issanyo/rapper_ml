[Verse 1]
Africa is my descent
And here I am far from home
I dwell within a land that's meant
Meant for many men not my tone

[Verse 2]
The blood of God is my defence
Let it drip down to my seed
Showers to your innocence
To protect you for all eternity
And with this wood I beat this drum
And we won't see defeat
From kings and queens becomes a prince
Knowledge and wisdom is understanding what we need

[Bridge]
And this game of love
Ever since the day you came
My whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
For your own
And this game of love
Everyday I see you grow
And remember what you already know
I receive, I receive the love
That radiates from your glow

[Verse 3]
From which you came was love
And that's how it all should be
You and my soul are one
Through all the time and history

[Outro]
And I thank you, thank you
