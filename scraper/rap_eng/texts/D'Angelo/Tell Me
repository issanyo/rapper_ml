[Hook: D'Angelo]
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on

[Verse 1: Baatin]
Tell me if you just want to get closer
You got the numbers on your poster
And if you want to, I'll make it so that
My sensual intensity captivates
You gotta know your body extractuates juice
Ecstasy is what I produce
Sweetie my virtues are never, ever looser
I'm not the average Joe Schmo you used to
This Jones in my bones could hurt you
Unless you ready for the lecture
Tell me if you just want to get closer
I wrote the numbers on your poster
And if ya want to, I'll make it so that
Never ever bringin' you the satisfaction of a climax
Climax, climax

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dilla]
Yeah, say what you feel, feel what you say
Don't hold back, it's real that way
Take the time and the time it takes
Baby you can justify you ain't got the time to waste
Speak up, speak up its not the time to play
You know I, I want ya in a special way (special way)
Special way (special way)
Special way (special way)
You know we need to make it happen like yesterday
You know, get it up and runnin' like Flo Jo
We can kick it like they do up in the dojo
And oh, if you ain't ready this can go slow
But yo, if you with it you can let me know so
Tell me if you want some and you can just
(Oooooh)

[Verse 3: T3]
See you sexy girl and also quite confident
You could sell goods and probably market it
Yo, what's up with seven digits can I pocket it?
I want to get with your prerogative
I bet ya need a lot to gets monotomous
Spitting more games than an evangelist
Girl you know you scandalous
I'm trying to get a one on one monogamous
Let's look into it like an analyst
I'm thinking about
Can you handle this?
Take you back to the room with just a little touch
Touching the zone thats erogenous
But thats enough we're really trying to chill what up?
Whats up with you?
Baby we can chill or what?
Whats up, we can chill or what
Whats up with you?
Baby we can chill or what
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Tell me if you want some and you can just, come on, baby
Come on baby (repeated until fade)
