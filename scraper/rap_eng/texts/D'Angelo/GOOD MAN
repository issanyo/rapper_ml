[Intro]
Hey DJ
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe, ay
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
So I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, babe

[Verse 1]
So I just wanna pick the phone up
Every single time you call
It don't matter where I'm is
I wanna be chillin with Obama talkin' business and see you callin' and tell him, "Hold up I gotta take this"
Let the world wait
Wanna wear it like a medal
Tell 'em that I'm a spoken for a fellow
Ladies say, "Hello" like I'm who they want to be with
I do everything with my left, I know you've seem trifiling
Listen baby I ain't nowhere near perfect
But I promise, I promise to make it all worth it
Giving you the things to be the man you deservin'
Makin' sure you're smiling, way more than you're hurtin'
Taking my time to hear you when you're talkin'
Remindin' you how bad you are, often
Keep them legs shakin', making love, and making sure you understand
That it's in my plan

[Chorus]
Said I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be
So I just wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want babe
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be, oh

[Verse 2]
Tell the truth, tell the whole damn truth
Never leaving out the parts I know gon' upset you
Never doin' things that I ain't got no business doin'
When you round, when you not around
I respect you
And I would never make a fool out you baby (no, no)
No, I will never make a fool out you baby (no, no)
I'm making sure you can trust me beyond a shadow of a doubt
So when them broads run up on you, with my name in their mouth
You tell 'em you can be gone with all that
'Cause you know what we got is beyond all that
You know we got that real thing (real thing)
Gon' be the object of some hatin', hatin'
But we gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
Making love after every fight
Girl, from the day I put that ring up on your hand
In front of friends and fam

[Chorus]
I had a plan and the plan is to be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be, babe
That's all I want to be, baby
That's all I want to be
Say that wanna be a good man, good man to you, girl
That's all I want to be
That's all I want to be, baby
All I want to be, oh

[Outro]
I wanna be a good man to you baby
