I think this is just being so
Carefree and loss (ohh)
Its natural [Incomprehensible]
Soon at the bar
Know what I am saying, its just hard
Just whatever the fuck
You should just call them a whole lot of simple than that
Something simple

[Verse 1]
Traveling at the speed of light and then
At the same time I'm in the same spot too
The room was kept in
'Bout the same way you left it
With about the threats you mess in attitude
Where ya' been with all your grin
Until all your friends turn their backs on you
Reminiscing over what you've been missing
Could be just like cousins kissing
That's taboo

[Chorus]
I just wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was
I just wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was
I used to get real high, now I
But now I'm just getting a buzz
I wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was

[Verse 2]
If you win, no matter if you lose
You got to come back again
Pay some dues
Back in Richmond, shit ain't changed a bit in
Niggas with a little piss in got some attitudes
I been wondering if I can ever again
So if you're wondering about the shape I'm in
I hope it ain't my abdomen that you're referring to
This what I want you to listen to

[Bridge]
Seasons may come and your luck just may run out
And all that you'll have is some memories, oh
Seasons may come and your luck just may run out
And all that you'll have is some memories, oh
Seasons may come and your luck just may run out
And all that you'll have is some memories, oh
Seasons may come and your luck just may run out
And all that you'll have is some memories, oh

[Chorus]
Said I just wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
I used to get real high
Now I'm just getting' a buzz, now, now, now
I said back to the way it was, now, now, now
I just wanna go back, baby
I just wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
I used to get real high
Now I'm just getting' a buzz, now, now, now
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
