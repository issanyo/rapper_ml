[Chorus]
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again

[Verse 1]
I don't know what it is that you're doing
All I know is baby, that you're sho'nuff doin' it good
And you look at me and my heart just starts the moving
I haven't felt like this in a while
Girl, I wanna thank you for helping me find my smile

[Chorus]
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again

[Verse 2]
My smile, hello, hello smile, I haven't seen you in a while
Your love, girl, your love, you make me feel like I'm on a cloud
And since I laid eyes on you, my spirit's been brand new
And I wanna thank you, child, oh, helping me find my smile

[Chorus x 4]
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again

Oh, ooh
You helped me
Oh, ooh
You helped me find my smile again

Honey, baby, got me smilin'
Honey, baby, got me smilin', oh-oh, whoa, oh
Honey, baby, got me smilin'
Honey, baby, got me smilin', oh-oh, whoa, oh
Honey, baby, yeah
Smilin', smilin', smilin'
Smilin', smilin', smilin'

I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again
I found my smile again
You helped me find my smile again
