[Chorus]
Tell me what you want and I'mma give it to ya
Don't want to be about your man or what he did to ya
Ain't no need to fuck around let me give it to ya
Call a nigga when you need him, talk shit to ya
Talk shit to ya

[Intro]
Talk shit to ya
Talk shit to ya
Talk shit to ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Marlon C]
Had a girl one time finer than all outdoors
She were nice but every last single one of her friends were hoes
I love the girl man, forget your friends
Said will be with me 'til the end I give you anything
And when you need your weed to be smoked, fuckin' go broke
Get your nails done every week if you want you can do ya feet
Fuck the receipt, I ain't gon' check up on you
See I trust you to the fullest for you, I'd take a bullet
Sit admit the world thought I had found the perfect woman
Cause she kept me coming 24/7 swear it were like heaven
When we made love thank the Lord above you all mine at all time
Believe you got that sunshine
Her heart and mind is open just as much as my nose is
You said you wanted one kid I told you three or four of em
Maybe a couple more of em, add to the collection
Real big ole house on the hill honey yeah we want you

[Bridge: D'Angelo & Marlon C]
If you tell me how you feel
Gon' break up with your ex
I'll be more than happy to set up shop
Since we already had sex, might as well finish the rest
Yeah I know you love what I'm tellin' ya
He don't spend time wit' you, wine and dine wit' you
He don't even go out in public wit' you he fuckin' wit' you
You better see the light and come on here tonight
Turn you loose on some vodka and juice, aight?
The way I kick it see it's better than Bruce, aight?
And when I've finished we can grab all the dudes, aight?

[Chorus x2]

[Intro]

[Verse 2: Marlon C]
You said now he ain't worth for shit, drink the liquor
Every time I call you on the phone with the nigga
Keep on playin' it off, your heart's soft smile when you see me
Let him know you need him, you know you ain't gon' leave him
Try to reach him by beeping him but his pager be at home
Cause see he creepin' while you sleepin' and that's the reason you weepin' and carryin' on
Perm but on a budget he took it back
Gave it to some other little heffa that you ain't like but that's life
You ain't his wife yet still you wanna be
Going back to some waters when you need to be with me
See it's all about letting go of this ho, girl stop that crying
The easy way to do this, amused me to see ya kept trying
Lying to yourself I ain't deaf, heard you wanted inside
I called by soon as you did it you started haulin' 'em off
What's the problem? I can solve 'em if you're down
See I ain't no Brandy I come in handy when it's just a rebound

[Chorus x2]
