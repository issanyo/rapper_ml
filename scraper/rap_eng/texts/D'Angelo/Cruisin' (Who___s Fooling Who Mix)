"Check it out, y'all"

[Verse 1]
Baby let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused baby, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
Oh, this is not a one night stand baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby

[Chorus]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

[Verse 2]
Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must baby
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
Every little part of each other, oh baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

[Chorus 2X]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

"Check it out, y'all"

And if you want it, you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you and love you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

[Chorus]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

"Check it out, y'all"
