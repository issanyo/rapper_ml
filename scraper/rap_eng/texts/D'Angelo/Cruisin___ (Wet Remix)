[Verse 1]
Baby let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused baby, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
Oh, this is not a one night stand baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby

[Chorus]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

[Verse 2]
Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must baby
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
Every little part of each other, ooh baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

Hey baby
I love it
Oh baby
Music was made for love
Ay...oh...ooh baby
I love it, I love it
Oh yeah
Glad you're going my way
Hey hey
Oh oh oh...ay
Made for love
Oh ooh, cruise with me baby...

Oh baby let's cruise, let's float, let's glide
Let's open up and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you and love you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby

[Chorus 2X]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Oh, we're gonna fly
Oh yeah, oh yeah baby
I love, yeah
Music is made for love
Love it, love it when we cruise baby
Come on baby
Music was made for love, hey baby
We're gonna fly away
Oh baby, come in, come on and cruise with me baby
When we cruise, hey baby
Yeah, cruise
