[Chorus]
Baby, I remember the way
Boy, you used to love me, love me every day
Baby, I remember the way
Boy, you used to love me, love me every day

[Verse 1]
Boy, it seems you don't appreciate the time
That I put into this love affair of ours
But I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down

[Chorus]
Baby, I remember the way
Boy, you used to love me, love me every day
Baby, I remember the way
Boy, you used to love me, love me every day

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
But you didn't hear me calling out
For your affection after all this time

[Bridge]
You can’t deny what I’m feeling is real
And I stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away

I remember, I remember
I remember the way you used to love me
I remember, I remember
I remember the way you used to love me

Boy, you didn’t hear me calling out
You used to love me (Love me every day)
Boy, you didn’t hear me calling out
(Didn’t hear me calling out for you)
You used to love me
Boy, you didn’t hear me calling out
You used to love me
Boy, you didn’t hear me calling out
You used to love me

I remember, I remember
I remember the way you used to love me
I remember, I remember
I remember the way you used to love me

[Chorus (Repeat until end)]
Baby, I remember the way
Boy, you used to love me, love me every day
