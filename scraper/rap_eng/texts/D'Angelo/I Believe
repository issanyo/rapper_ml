[Intro: Q-Tip]
Love…love…love…I believe
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: D’Angelo]
I believe, that’s love
I believe, that’s love
I believe, that’s love
I believe, that’s love

[Verse 1: Q-Tip + (D’Angelo)]
When ya give back from what you receive (That’s love), ya know
When ya hold me down and made me believe (That’s love), ya know
When ya see, oh, she let you go (That’s love), ya know
And when we say “Ho!”, y’all say “Ho!” (That’s love)
Don’t think about it when my back is turned
I know you’re right there for me and I won’t get burned
Love shows itself in so many ways
That we sometimes overlook it in the course of a day
Don’t be mad, girl; you used to be sad, girl
But now that we got this, forget what we had, girl
And see the forest from the trees
It’s not windy, it’s just a breeze, ya know

[Chorus: D’Angelo]
I believe, that’s love
I believe, that’s love
I believe, that’s love
I believe, that’s love

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
When a Blood and Crip put down they rip (That’s love), ya know
When you’re in the club and you move to this (That’s love), ya know
When your fam is fed and they rest their head (That’s love), ya know
And bring them home now, that’s what we said (That’s love)
I’m on your stereo and I’m in your video
When I’m gonna put the keyed on a nonstop stream
I really can’t stop but I hit y’all with a drop
“Hey, y’all, this is Tip on W-E-DREAM”
W-E-D-R-E-M—request this then show love to me, fam

Come on, come on, come on…

[Chorus: D’Angelo]
I believe, that’s love (Repeat until end [28X])
