CHORUS:
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady

Don't think I don't see them looking at ya
All of them wishing they could have ya
And as a matter of fact, uh
A bunch of them are itchin'for you to scratch'em
I'm tired of hiding what we feel
I'm trying to get with the real
And I'm-a gonna make it know
'Cause I want them to know

CHORUS

You're my little baby, my darling baby
I swear you're the talk of the town
And everybody wants to know what's going down
Babe, I know they've seen us before
Maybe at the liquor store, or maybe at the health food stand
They don't know that I'm your man

CHORUS

I can tell they're looking at us
I pick you up everyday from your job
And every guy in the parking lot wants to rob me of my girl
And my heart and soul, and everybody wants to treat me so cold
But I know I love you and you love me
There's no other lover for you or me
You're my lady

BRIDGE (AD LIB)

You're my lady
My divine lady
You're my lady
Such a wonderful lady
I can't tell they're looking at us

REPEAT TO FADE
