[Verse 1]
Time keeps on slippin'
Into the future
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future

[Chorus]
I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly
Fly right into the future

[Verse 2]
I wanna feed the babies
Who can't get enough to eat
Wanna shoe the children
With no shoes on their feet
I wanna house the people
Livin' in the street
Oh, oh, there's a solution

[Chorus]
Let me fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let that spirit carry me
I want to fly, oh ya
Fly right into the future

[Verse 3]
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future
Time flies don't it, baby
Time keeps on slippin', slippin', slippin'
Into the future, oh
Time flies don't it, baby

[Bridge]
Oooh, keep on flying, keep on flying, ooh
Oh yeah, yeah
Don't it baby
Hey

[Chorus]
I want to fly like an eagle
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly
Fly right into the future
(To the rhythm baby)

[Chorus]
I want to fly like an eagle (fly like an eagle wanna fly)
To the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let that spirit carry me
I want to fly (fly like an eagle wanna fly)
Fly right into the future

[Outro]
In a sky full of people only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy? Ooh
Fly like an eagle, wanna fly
Fly like an eagle, wanna fly
Fly like an eagle, wanna fly
Fly like an eagle, wanna fly
