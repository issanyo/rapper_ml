I'm Glad You're Mine
Baby, I'm so glad you're here
Baby, I've got something to say to you, my dear
Baby, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine

Whoa, baby, why did it take so long?
Oh, baby, only made my love grow strong
Baby, yeah, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine

When darkness comes around
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down

Baby, I'm not gonna leave you alone
Baby, on top of that, I'll give you what you want
Baby, yeah, so glad you're mine

When darkness comes around
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down

I know you'll never say, baby
Baby, I'm gonna turn my back and walk away
Baby, I'll see you another day, hey baby

I'm so, I'm so
Thankful for your love
Thankful for your love
Glad you're mine
Thankful for your love

Im so thankful for your love
