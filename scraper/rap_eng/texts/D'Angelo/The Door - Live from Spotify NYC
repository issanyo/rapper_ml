I told you once but twice
You wasn't very nice
In your hands you held my life
I told you once but twice, my love
Don't lock yourself out that door
No, no, no
Don't lock yourself out that door
Behind a silky shade
You danced the masquerade
On a float in your parade
And on the music played
My love
Don't lock yourself out that door, no no no
Don't lock yourself out that door
I wrote a perfect song
You sang it all night long
Held your breath when you were done
And waltzed out with the sun
My love
Don't lock yourself out that door, no no no
Don't lock yourself out that door
I told you once but twice
You wasn't very nice
In your hands you held my life
I told you once but twice, my love
Don't lock yourself out that door, no, no, no
Don't lock yourself out that door
