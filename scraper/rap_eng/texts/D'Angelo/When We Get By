[Verse 1]
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
I look in your eyes, when I look in your eyes
I know what you're thinking of
T'is a beautiful day, and you're welcome to stay
We can spend some time and catch the matinee
Sugar, you're so fine, and the day is fine
And we'll be fine
When we make it by and we get by with love

[Hook]
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love

[Verse 2]
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
I look in your eyes, I look in your eyes
They're pretty as the skies above
Everything, everything, everything is okay
We could make love in the shade
Sip some chocolate lemonade
Sugar, you're so fine, and the journey's fine
And we'll be fine
When we make it by and we get by with love

[Hook]
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love

[Bridge]
Oh - oh, oh, oh, oh make it by
Oh - oh, oh, oh, oh we'll make it by
Oh - oh, oh, oh, oh we'll make it by - by - by

[Verse 3]
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
I look in your eyes, when I look in your eyes
I know what you're thinking of
Cause it's just a beautiful day
And you know that's a fact
And, you scratch mine
And, I'll scratch your back
Sugar, you're so fine, and the journey's fine
And we'll be fine
When we make it by and we get by with love

[Hook]
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
When we get by, we'll make it by
When we get by with love
