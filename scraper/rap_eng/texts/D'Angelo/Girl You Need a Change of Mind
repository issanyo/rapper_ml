Ooh la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, (let me tell you) girl you need a change of mind

[Verse 1]
Why march in picket lines?
Burn bras and carry signs?
Now, I'm for women's rights
I just want equal nights

[Chorus]
Baby, (Yeah) girl you need a change of mind
Oh baby, girl you need a change of mind

[Verse 2]
All men don't discriminate (Well, what you say?)
This man emancipates
And I won't chain you up
Just fill your loving cup
Oh hey, hey, you need me

[Bridge]
Baby, what you say to that? Hey, what you say to that?
Hey baby, you need a change of mind, baby
What you say to that? What you say to that?
Hey baby, you need a change of mind
What you say to that? Hey, what you say to that?
Bet I could change it, if it takes all night
Nothing challenging
I know you need me, I know you need me

It's all right
What you say to that?

Let me try to change you (Repeated with ad-libs)

Ooh, I know I can

[Chorus]
Baby, girl you need a change of mind
Oh baby, girl you need a change of mind
Baby, girl you need a change of mind
Baby, oh baby, girl you need a change of mind
Baby, girl you need a change of mind
Oh baby, girl you need a change of mind...
