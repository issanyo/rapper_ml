[Intro]
Woah woah woah yeah yeah yeah
Woah woah woah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woah woah woah

[Verse 1]
When I first saw you baby
I wanted to die
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine
Started to cry then I'd dream
Wishin' my fantasy
Would soon become a reality
Cause every time I see you baby
All I do is sigh
Cause you're the most precious thing baby
That my dreamin' eyes has ever seen
So I continue to dream
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine
Ohhhh

[Bridge]
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination runnin' too far
Or is it that my eyes are tellin' me something you could never see
Somethin' like me being with you
And you being with me

[Chorus]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
Your love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin eyes of mine

[Verse 2]
Oh my goodness here she comes
Switching that ass
I wonder if the men in her past
Had treated her bad
But if I had the chance
I'd treat her like a queen
Just like I do in all my dreams
If you only knew how many times
That I think of you
I'm quite sure that you would find yeah
I'm sure that you would find
I'm going out my mind
My oh my, me and those dreamin eyes of mine
Ohhhh

[Bridge]
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination runnin' too far
Or is it that my eyes are tellin' me something you could never see
Somethin' like me being with you
And you being with me

[Chorus]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
Your love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin eyes of mine

[Bridge]
Ohhhh
Is it just that you're the finest little thing that I ever saw
Or is my imagination runnin' too far
Or is it that my eyes are tellin' me something you could never see
Somethin' like me being with you
And you being with me

[Chorus]
Ooh wee baby you've redefined my vision of love it seems
Your love be the cherry in my chocolate covered dreams
So it seems my oh my
Me and those dreamin eyes of mine
