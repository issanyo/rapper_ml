[Chorus: D'Angelo & Angela Stone]
Said I got a jonz in my bonz
I said this feeling that I got
Won't leave me 'lone
Said I got a jonz in bonz
I said this feelin' I got
Goes long and strong

[Verse: D'Angelo]
All my natural life I've been waiting
I've been holding on
To everything that belongs to me
Fooled, misled by every single possibility
What I wouldn't give to be
Next to the things that where meant foâ€™ me
Uh ooh

[Chorus - D'Angelo ft. Angela Stone]
Said I got a jonz in my bonz
I said this feeling that I got
Won't leave me 'lone
Said I got a jonz in bonz
I said this feelin' I got
Goes long and strong

On and on, on and on, on and on, on, on
Baby, shoo do doo da do

[Chorus - D'Angelo ft. Angela Stone]
Said I got a jonz in my bonz
I said this feeling that I got
Won't leave me 'lone
Said I got a jonz in bonz
I said this feelin' I got
Goes long and strong

Ad lib out
