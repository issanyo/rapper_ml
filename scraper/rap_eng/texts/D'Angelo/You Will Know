Mmm...hmm...hmm...mmm...hmm...
Yeah, yeah

When I was a young boy
I had visions of fame
They were wild and they were free
They were blessed with my name

And then I grew older
And I saw what’s to see
That the world is full of pain
And my dreams they left me

And then I got stronger
Inside of the pain
That’s when I picked up the pieces
And I regained my name

And I fought hard, y’all
To call by my place
And right now you could ask me
And it all seems in vain

[Your dreams ain’t easy] Your dreams ain’t easy
[You just stick by your plan] You just stick by your plan
[Go from boys to men] Go from boys to men
[You must act like a man] You gotta act like a man
[When it gets hard, y’all] When it gets hard, y’all
[You just grab what you know] Got what you know
[Stand up tall and don’t you fall] And my background sing

You will know [You will know], yeah...eah...
[You will know]
[You will know] You will know, you will know
[You will know]

And I know you’re cryin’
‘Cause it’s all in his vein
And the things you want you can’t have
It just all went away

But life ain’t over
Hoo...hoo...
Just grab the winds and make demands
And the vibe will take you far

[Your dreams ain’t easy] Your dreams ain’t easy
[You just stick by your plan] Stick by your plan, boy
[Go from boys to men] Go from boys to men
[You must act like a man] I know it ain’t easy
[When it gets hard, y’all] it gets hard sometime
[You just grab what you know] Yes, it does
[Stand up tall and don’t you fall] Stand up tall, don’t you fall, and you will know, yeah

[You will know]
[You will know] Ah...ah...ah... (You will know)
[You will know] Hey, there’s no doubt about it
[You will know] Hey, you will know

[You will know] You will know
[You will know] Hey...ey...hey...
[You will know] You will know, yeah
[Oh, you will know] Hey...

[Your dreams ain’t easy] Your dreams ain’t easy
[You just stick by your plan] Stick by your plans
[Go from boys to men] Boys to men
[You must act like a man] You must act like a man
[When it gets hard, y’all] It ain’t hard, yeah
[You just grab what you know] Grab what you know
[Stand up tall and don’t you fall] Oh...oh...oh...

[Your dreams ain’t easy]
[You just stick by your plan] Hey...hey...yeah
[Go from boys to men] Boys to men
[You must act like a man] I know it ain’t easy
[When it gets hard, y’all]
[You just grab what you know] Yeah...
[Stand up tall and don’t you fall] Come on D and sing this song

[You will know] Yeah...
