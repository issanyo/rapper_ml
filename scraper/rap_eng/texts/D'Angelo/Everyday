[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now I've had my bouts with love
Been going through things you never heard of
Breakin' up and gettin' back together
Faced with all kinds of stormy weather
There was a time I thought I'd lose my mind
But my friends and family warned me
Time after time after time

[Chorus]
Tell me how you gonna get something
With all you gave up, was nothing
Every day, every day, every day, baby
You twisted my mind
And tell me why is it that I'm buggin'
Now that I've got everything
Every day, every way you gonna pay, baby
For dissin' my love

[Verse 2]
Now, baby, it took a view
For me to get over you
I didn't think I could make it
But my faith in God said I could change this
Back in the day I wasn't good enough for you but
I would do anything to win you over
You took advantage of my attention
Oh, did I forget to mention
Every day you did the same thing
And every hour you'd switch up on me
And every minute I'd be forgiving
And every second we'd be reliving

[Chorus]
Tell me how you gonna get something
All you gave up, was nothing
Every day, every day, every day baby
You twisted my heart
Tell me why is it that I'm buggin'
Now that I've got everything
Every day, every way you gonna pay, baby
For dissin' my love

[Bridge]
Well, it was your attitude (was much too shrewd)
'Cause you took me, now who's the fool
(Tell me, tell me, tell me)
'Cause I've had my bouts with love
Goin' through things you never heard of
Breakin' up, gettin' back together
Faced with all kinds of stormy weather
There was a time I thought I'd lose my mind
My friends and family warned me
Time after time after time

[Chorus]
Tell me how you gonna get something
All you gave up, was nothing
Every day, every day, every day baby
You twisted my heart
Tell me why is it that I'm buggin'
Now that I've got everything
Every day, every way you gonna pay, baby
For dissin' my love
'Cause all you gave up, was nothing
Every day, every day, every day baby
You twisted my heart
