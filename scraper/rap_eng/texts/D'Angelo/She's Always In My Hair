[Verse 1]
Whenever  I feel like giving up
Whenever my sunshine
Turns to gray
Whenever my hopes and dreams
Are aimed in the wrong direction
She’s always there
Telling me how much she cares
She’s always in my hair

[Chorus]
She’s always in my hair
My hair

[Verse 2]
Whenever I feel like I’m not too great at all
Whenever I feel like I’m all alone
And even if I hit the wrong notes
She’s always in my boat
Telling me how much she cares
She’s always in my hair

[Chorus]
She’s always in my hair
My hair

[Verse 3]
Maybe I’ll marry her (Maybe I’ll marry her)
Maybe I won’t
Maybe I will not
Even if I was a gigolo my whole life (Gigolo all my life)
She’d still be there
Telling me how much she really cares (She cares)
She’s always in my hair

[Chorus]
She’s always in my hair
My hair

[Verse 1]
Whenever I feel like giving up
Whenever my sunshine
Turns to gray
Whenever my hopes and dreams
Are aimed in the wrong direction
She’s always there
Telling me how much she cares
She’s always in my hair

[Outro]
She’s always in my hair (gotta get her out of my hair)
She's always in my hair (repeat)
