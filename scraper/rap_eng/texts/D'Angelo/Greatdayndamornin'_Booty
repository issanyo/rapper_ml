Part 1: Greatdayindamornin'

[Verse 1]
Today, I played it safe
Cards are in my favor
Can't leave too much to chance
Woke up with time to waver
Yesterday was crazy
Mysteries I know now
Now I know the ins and outs of things
From day to day, that's how it goes
Don't get confused about it
Just try to do your thing
Cause in the end
Got to know just how to play the game
I search for answers often
I paid the price for many
Still long for happiness, not promised to the plenty
But I've got to go on

[Chorus]
Good days, bad days, halfway days
Good times, bad times, halfway times
Good days, bad days, halfway days
But I'm still looking for a great day in the morning

[Verse 2]
Today might be the day
I get it in the pocket
Lord knows if there's an angle
Got to try to find it, got to get over
Before the sun comes up
Just in case of an emergency
Got to tighten up, but here it goes

[Chorus]
Good days, bad days, halfway days
Good times, bad times, halfway times
Good days, bad days, halfway days
But I'm still looking for a great day in the morning

[Verse 3]
I said today could really be the day
Said it can go wrong or right, alright, baby
My body could melt good night
Don't you let them switch you, baby
Said the most crazy mystery
Ins and outs of things, day to day
How they supposed to know?

[Chorus]
Good days, bad days, halfway days
Good times, bad times, halfway times
Good days, bad days, halfway days
But I'm still looking for a great day in the morning

[Verse 4]
I know it gets hard
I know it gets hard sometimes
Gather the people
Said I got it all in my spirit
And I know this morning when I rose
Gonna be, got to be crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
Good days, bad days, halfway days
Good times, bad times, halfway times
Good days, bad days, halfway days
But I'm still looking for a great day in the morning
Good days, bad days, halfway days
Good times, bad times, halfway times
Good days, bad days, halfway days
But I'm still looking for a great day in the morning
Good days, bad days, halfway days
Good times, bad times, halfway times
Good days, bad days, halfway days
But I'm still looking for a great day in the morning

Part 2: Booty

[Verse]
Everybody likes the morning, the morning
Sunshine in the morning, the morning
Said we make love in the morning, the morning
Pray to God in the morning, in the morning
Get it on in the morning, the morning
Take a shower in the morning, the morning
Smoke somethin' in the morning, the morning
Said it'll be all good in the morning, the morning
It's a new day in the morning, the morning

[Outro]
We getting down, down in the morning
Yeah, we getting down, down in the morning
You know we getting down, down in the morning
Yeah, we getting down, down in the morning
You know we getting down, down in the morning
Know we getting down, down in the morning
You know we getting down, down in the morning
Yo, we getting down, down in the morning
You know we getting down
