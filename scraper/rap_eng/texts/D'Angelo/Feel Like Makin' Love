[Verse 1]
Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Watchin' lovers do their thing

[Chorus]
That's the time
I feel like making love to you
That's the time
I feel like making dreams come true
Oh baby

[Verse 2]
When you talk to me
When you're moanin' sweet and low
When you touch me
And my feelings start to show, show, oh

[Chorus]
That's the time
I feel like making love to you
That's the time
I feel like making dreams come true, oh baby
That's the time
I feel like making love to you
That's the time
I feel like making dreams come true, oh baby

[Verse 3]
In a restaurant
Holdin' hands by candlelight
Wanna touch you
Wantin' you with all my might, yeah

[Chorus]
That's the time
I feel like making love to you
That's the time
I feel like making dreams come true, oh baby
That's the time
I feel like making love to you
That's the time
I feel like making dreams come true, oh baby
