[Verse 1]
Baby, let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused baby, the way is clear
And if you want it, you got it forever
Oh, this is not a one night stand baby
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

[Chorus]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

[Verse 2]
Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must baby
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
Every little part of each other, ooh baby, baby
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

[Chorus 2X]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
(I love it, I love...)

We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Oh, ooh, cruise with me, baby

[Verse 3]
Oh baby let's cruise, let's float, let's glide
Ooh, let's open up and go inside
And if you want it, you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you and love you, baby
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

[Chorus 3X]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together
Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
