[Verse 1]
Whenever it rains I feel this way
A little somethin' to get me through this day
Give me a little that, no time flat
Gonna be a good thing
Some people in need of feelin' free
Lettin' go and landin' on my feet
Brushed the dirt off my back, no time flat
Gonna be a good thing

[Chorus]
Well, people believe this sayin' is true
Whatever will be, will forever do
Whatever the cost, I'll pay in full
I ain't got nothin' to do with you

[Verse 2]
Gotta get out, gotta get out of here
I'm in the dark and the light looks sincere
Brushed the dirt off my back, no time flat
Gonna be a good thing
All you do is complain about your pain
And the cloud that follows you won't cease to rain
Don't look back, handle that
Make it into a good thing

[Verse 3]
Somethin' in me's gotta be
Soul controller in control of me
A link in your chain just won't do
I don't want nothin' to do with you

[Guitar Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Somethin' stirrin' inside of me's gotta be
Soul controller in control of me
A link in your chain just won't do
I don't want nothin' to do with you

[Chorus]
Well, people believe this sayin' is true
Whatever will be, will forever do
Whatever the cost, I'll pay in full
I ain't got nothin' to do with you

[Outro]
I ain't got nothin' to do with you
I ain't got nothin' to do with you
I ain't got nothin' to do with you
I ain't got nothin' to do with you
I ain't got nothin' to do with you
