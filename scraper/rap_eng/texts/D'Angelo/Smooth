[Verse 1]
How do you retain your cool
Seems your love breaks all the rules
You may think that I'm a pro
But I can never seem to keep my control
How can you stand to take things so slow

[Chorus]
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool

[Verse 2]
I'm so used to getting what I want
When I want it and where I want it
But in your field I'm inexperienced
So inexperienced, baby I'm delirious

[Chorus]
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool

[Verse 3]
So just like you, I'll keep my cool
When you're around, I won't be the fool
You may think that I don't know
But all the things, I want are in my control
How can I stand to take so slow

[Chorus]
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
Look at you
You're so smooth
When I'm around you
I can't keep my cool
