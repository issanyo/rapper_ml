[Verse 1]
Girl it's only you
Have it your way
And if you want you can decide
That if you'll have me
I can provide everything that you desire
Said if you get a feeling
Feeling that I am feeling
Won't you come closer to me baby
You've already got me right where you want me baby
I just wanna be your man

[Chorus]
How does it feel
How does it feel
Said I wanna know how does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel

[Verse 2]
I wanna stop (playing all)
Silly little games you and me play
And I am feeling right on
If you feel the same-way baby
Let me know right away
I'd love to make you wet
In between your thighs cause
I love when it comes inside you
I get so excited when I'm around you, l

[Chorus]
How does it feel
How does it feel
Said I wanna know how does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel

[Outro]
Baby close the door
Listen girl I have something I wanna show you
I wish you'd open up cause
I wanna take the walls down with you
