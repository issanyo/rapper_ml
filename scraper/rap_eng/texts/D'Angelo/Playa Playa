[Intro]
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one

[Verse 1]
Steal you with my two shot
Control you with my drop
Blaze you with my handle
Impress you with my rock
Play you like a pro
And take over the show
Stick you and defeat you
Rob you of your glow
Rob you of your glow

[Verse 2]
Bring the drama playa
Give me all you got
Make your move
Shoot your best shot
(I see right through your riddle)
I keep on when I dribble
Slip right past the block
Set you up for two
Shoot your best shot
Shoot your best shot

[Chorus]
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one

[Verse 3]
Playa try and play me
We dyin' to set it off
Marlon, Slick and Weasel
Can hardly wait to ball
My groove is tight
Drummers drummin' right
Dirts our secret weapon
Each and every night
Each and every night

[Verse 4]
We come here to rip shit
To make y'all scream and shout
Later for all y'all haters
We gon' turn this motha' out
If you came to ball
If y'all came at all
We don't plan to stop
'Til you bouncin' off the wall
'Til you bouncin' off the wall

[Verse 5]
Bring the drama playa
Give me all you got
Make your move
Shoot your best shot
(I see right through your riddle)
I dribble it
Slip right past the block
Set you up for two
Shoot your best shot
Shoot your best shot

[Chorus]
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one
We're the playas number one

[Outro]
Play on, play on
Play on, play on
(Oh, won't you play on)
Play on, play on
(Put your hands to God)
Play on, play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on
(Play on)
Play on, play on
Play on, play on
(Play on, yeah)
Play on, play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on
Play on, play on
Play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on, play on
