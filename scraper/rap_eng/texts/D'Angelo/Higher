[Verse 1]
Feels like heaven when I think about you
Sparking that love within my soul
And when I touch you, I can't describe it
Sending chills, down to my bones

[Bridge 1]
With God as my witness and watching over
We'll write our love in the stone
Please give us strength Lord to fight our battles
And we can walk on the streets of gold

[Hook]
Cause you take me higher, than I've ever, ever known
Give me good feeling, like a king and queen on a throne
Cause you take me higher, further than the sky above
Send me in ecstasy baby, with you love

[Verse 2 ]
Tell me what you're thinking of, must be thinking bout love
Put your hands into mine and then we'll take off to the sky above
Soft like an angel, like the feathers laying on a dove
Touch me with your soul love, till I lose control

[Bridge 2]
Just like an angel watching over me
(You protect me from my fears)
I once was blind, but now I see
(Ever since the day you appeared)
I just wanna say
I want you in my life
Till the day I die baby
Look in my eyes
Tell me right now
That U and your love
Will forever take me higher

[Bridge 1]
With God as my witness and watching over
We'll write our love in the stone
Please give us strength Lord to fight our battles
And we can walk on the streets of gold

[Hook]
Cause you take me higher, than I've ever, ever known
Give me good feeling, like a king and queen on a throne
Cause you take me higher, further than the skies above
Send me in ecstasy baby, with your love
