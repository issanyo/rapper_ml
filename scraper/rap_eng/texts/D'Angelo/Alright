[Verse 1]
That's alright
We may have a misunderstanding
That's okay
Because you're my girl and I'm your man
And that's just fine
Girl your touch still drives me wild
We'll be alright
Cause all we have to do is just talk for a while

[Bridge]
And if we don't see eye to eye
At least we tried
We been through too much
To let all the little things get in the middle of
So let us ease back, relax
Cause everything's gonna be alright

[Hook]
Gonna be alright
Be alright
Gonna be alright
Be alright
Gonna be alright
Be alright

[Verse 2]
Baby doll
You don't have to worry at all
Cause it's alright
Girl, we've climbed too high to fall
So let's talk about it
And baby if we disagree, then let's forget about it
Cause in the end I'll always love you and you'll love me

[Bridge]
And if we don't see eye to eye
At least we tried
We been through too much
To let all the little things get in the middle of
So let us ease back, relax
Cause everything's gonna be alright

[Hook]
Gonna be alright
Be alright
Gonna be alright
Be alright
Gonna be alright
Be alright
