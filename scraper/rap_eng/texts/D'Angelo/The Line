[Intro]
Let me tell you about it
I wanna tell you about it
Let me tell you

[Verse 1]
I've been gone, gone so long
Just wanna sing, sing my song
I know you've been hearin'
Hearin' a lot of things about me
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
I've heard, I've heard it all too clear
This is what I am going to do, yeah
I'm gonna, I'm gonna hold, hold on
Hold on to my pride, my pride
I'm gonna stick, I'm gonna stick, I'm gonna stick
I'm gonna stick to my guns, gonna stick to my guns, yeah
I'm gonna put my finger on the trigger
I'm gonna pull it and we gon' see what the deal
I'm for real, I just wanna put it, put it on the line
That's all I wanna do, I've gotta put it on the line
And we haven't got much time
I've gotta put it, put it on the line
Know what I'm talking 'bout this evening
Said I get to put it, oh, yeah, I've gotta put it on the line

[Verse 2]
Listen to me
Said, I got a bullet in the chamber
And I'm not afraid of danger
Said, we got to go down, down to the wire
I'll go through the fire with you
Kill and die with you
Said, I know everybody watchin' me
I said the pressure is on
From every angle, political to personal
Will I hang or get left hangin'?
Will I fall off, or is it bangin'?
And I says it's up to God
It's up to the man upstairs
But all I gotta do is
Hold, hold on to my pride, my pride
I'm gonna stick, stick
I'm gonna stick to my guns, gonna stick to my guns, yeah
I'm gonna put my finger on the trigger
I'm gonna pull it and we gon' see what the deal baby
I'm for real, I just want to put it all on the line


Somebody out there knows I'm singin' about
Would you help me sing this song

[Outro]
Said the stakes is high, yeah
It's the moment of truth
And If I can hold on, hold on
I'm sure everything will be alright
