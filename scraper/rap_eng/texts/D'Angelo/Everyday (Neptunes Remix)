[Intro: Angie Stone]
Uh, uh, uh
What? Check it out
Angie Stone, on the remix with who?
Neptunes

[Verse 1: Angie Stone]
I've had my bouts with love
I've been going through things you never heard of
Breakin' up and gettin' back together
Faced with all kinds of stormy weather
There was a time thought I'd lose my mind
My friends and family warned me
Time after time after time

[Chorus: Angie Stone]
Tell me how you gonna get something
All you gave up was nothing
Every day, every day, every day, baby
You twisted my heart
Tell me why I got to be buggin' now that I've got everything
Every day, every way you gonna pay

[Verse 2: Angie Stone]
Now baby it took a few
For me to get over you
I didn't think I could make it
But my faith in God said I could check it
Back in the day I wasn't good enough for you
I'd do anything to win you over
You took advantage of my attention
Oh, did I forget to mention
Every day you did the same thing
Every hour you'd switch up on me
Every minute I'd be forgiving
And every second we'd be reliving
Every day you did the same thing
Every hour you'd switch up on me
Every minute I'd be forgiving
And every second we'd be reliving

[Chorus: Angie Stone]
Tell me how you gonna get something
All you gave up was nothing
Every day, every day, every day, baby
You twisted my heart
Tell me why I got to be buggin' now that I've got everything
Every day, every way you gonna pay

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Yo, yo, uh
How you only recall all the rough times?
We ain't laugh late nights watching Loveline?
I ain't rubbed your back, you ain't rubbed mine?
I ain't kissed on yours, you ain't kissed mine
I guess you the only one hurt
Like I don't miss riding hand up your skirt
With my chrome in your purse
There's a lot chicks out here loving to flirt
You got my name in the streets
They just lovin' the dirt
What? I ain't keep 88 in the lining
Couldn't divide 'em only if I slide 'em, straight grinding
Moon shining, getting cake 'til dawn
Amnesia, huh? I ain't take you on
Shopping sprees to D.C. order from Rodeo
Spit the credit card number only if I say so
Packing that pack and packing that mack
You know what this is, why you actin' like that?

[Chorus: Angie Stone]
Tell me how you gonna get something
All you gave up was nothing
Every day, every day, every day, baby
You twisted my heart
Tell me why I got to be buggin' now that I've got everything
Every day, every way you gonna pay

[Bridge]
Well, it was your attitude, much too shrewd
Caused you to lose, now who's the fool?
It was your attitude, much too shrewd
Caused you to lose, now who's the fool?
'Cause all I had was love for you
And there ain't nothing more to do
'Cause I had a crazy, crazy, crazy love baby, babe, baby, baby, yeah
See, when you come home early
Don't come with that freaking respect
'Cause I ain't got no time for packing up your, ooh

Uh, keep it hot, ooh, ooh ah, ooh

[Chorus: Angie Stone]
Tell me how you gonna get something
All you gave up was nothing
Every day, every day, every day, baby
You twisted my heart
Tell me why I got to be buggin' now that I've got everything
Every day, every way you gonna pay
