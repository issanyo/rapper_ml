Chorus

Said I gota jonz in my bonz
I said this feeling that I got
Won't leave me 'lone
Said I got a jonz in bonz
I said this feelin' I got
Goes long and strong

Verse

All my natural life I've been waiting
I've been holding on
To everything that belongs to me
Fooled , misied by every single possibility
What I wouldn't give to be
Next to the things that where meant fo me
Uh ooh

Chorus

On and on, on and on, on and on, on, on
Baby, shoo do doo da do

Chorus

Ad lib out
