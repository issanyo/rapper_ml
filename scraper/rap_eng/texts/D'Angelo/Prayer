Soul prayer, soul prayer
Hallowed be thy name
Kingdom come, will be done, oh yeah
I do... the devil on your feet
I know that he will, he will try to stop you
From seeing your days

[Refrain]
But you got to pray all the way
Till you get on
I believe that some day we will rise

I know that he will try to harm you
And if you can
I know that you will make it to the promised land
But you got to pray, you got pray
Oh you got to pray for redemption
Lord, keep me away from temptation
Deliver us from evil, oh yeah

[Refrain]
And all this confusion around me
Give me peace
I believe that love...
