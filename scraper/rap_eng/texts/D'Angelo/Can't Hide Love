Uuh, Yeah Uuh
You want my love and you can't deny
You know it's good, but you try to hide
You turn down love like it's really bad
You can't give what you never had
Well bless your soul, you can fool a few (hey ai)
But, I know the truth and so do you
You can't hide love
But I betcha (uuh) betcha (betcha)
You can't hide longer
Well I betcha (well I betcha)
You can't hide feeling inside
You can't pretend there's nothing there
Girl, I look in your eyes, I see you care
So why not stop trying to run and hide
You won't find out, if you never try
You can't hide love
But I betcha (uuh) betcha (betcha)
You want my love well I betcha (well I betcha)
You can't hide feeling inside
Can you found the time for kissin'
Can you find the time to listen
Life found the time to bug you
Can you find the time for blessing (hey ai)
Aah ahha aahaah
