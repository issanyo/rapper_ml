You know what
I think heaven is
I think heaven is you
You know that

A place where I can find happiness
A place close to your lovliness
Some where to rest my acking mine al al
Where there's no time your love just divine

Heaven must be like this
It must be like this
Heaven must be like this
It must be like this

The sweet in sour taste of love
We just made a good place in the shade
A glass of champagne al al
Don't be afraid just love

Heaven must be, heaven, must be, like this
Heaven must be like this
Heaven must be like this
It must be like this

Wrap your love around me
Listen girl there's no place like you
Your all the places
A place where I can find happness
A place close to your lovliness
Some where to rest my acking mine al al
Where there is no time
Heaven must be like this
It must be like this
