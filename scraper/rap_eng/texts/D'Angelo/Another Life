[Verse 1]
How does one attempt to be
The kind of friend that you would want to keep?
I just want to say to thee
Even though it might be hard to believe
The candy-coated thoughts that drift through my sleep
Lets me know it's you that holds the key
I got a craving for confection so sweet
For the taste of when our lips first meet

[Chorus]
Oh, in another life, I bet you wouldn't know that
Oh, in another life, I bet you were my girl

[Verse 2]
I just wanna take you with me
To secret rooms in the mansions of my mind
Shower you with all that you need
Take my hand, I swear I'll take my time
I'm not surprised to find that angels compete
For the chance to lay down at your feet
I'm gonna touch in all of the places that please
Pull you close
I wanna feel you breathe

[Chorus]
Oh, in another life, I bet you wouldn't know that
Oh, in another life, I bet you were my girl

It's another reason for the season
I don't wanna break your heart
Oh, in another life, I bet you were my girl, Oh!

In another life, I bet you wouldn't know that
In another life, I bet you were my girl
Oh, in another life, I bet you wouldn't know that
