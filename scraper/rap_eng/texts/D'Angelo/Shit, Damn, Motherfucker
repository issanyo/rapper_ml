[Verse 1]
Why are you sleepin' with my woman
Why are you sleepin' with my woman
This comes as a total surprise
I just can't believe my eyes
My best friend and my wife

[Hook]
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Why the both of you's buck-balled naked?
Why the both of you's buck-balled naked?
I'm tellin' you what's on my mind
I'm 'bout to go get my nine
And kill both of y'all's behind

[Hook]
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker

[Bridge]
Why the both of you's bleeding so much?
Why the both of you's bleeding so much?
Why the both of you's bleeding so much?
Why am I wearin' handcuffs?

[Hook]
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker
