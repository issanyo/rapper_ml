I'll Stay
For She'll Be Coming Back
You Know Her Head Went Out To Play
She'll Get Over That
I Know That My Reward
When She Returns
Woo-woo!
Keeps Me Hanging On
I'll Stay

I'll Stay
Though Friends They Ridicule
You Know For Her There Is No Substitute
Talk I Can Endure (I Must Endure)
But That's Alright, Mother Says "Son"
Know My Reward
When She Returns (Whoo-whoo !)
She'll Still Come Home, Whoaah
Keeps Me Hanging On
I'll Stay
Ba ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba doo-whoo whoo-whoo
Ba ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba doo-whoo whoo-whoo
Ba ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba doo-whoo whoo-whoo
{continues to end}
You Know Her Head Went Out To Play
That's All Right
The Girl Will Get Over That
Lord, My Reward Is Gonna Be Much Greater
Every Night, Lord, Is Gonna Replace Her
And If Another Girl Decides She Wants To Go Home
Wait Right There
Wait Right Here
Wait Right Here
I Ain't Goin' Nowhere, Baby
Wait Right Here
Wait Right Here
I'm Gonna Stand Right Here
On This Ground and Wait
Hey hey hey hey
