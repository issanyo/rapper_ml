[Verse 1]
I know some things have changed since the last
I've seen you, some good, some for the bad, baby
All and all I can't complain that's what I've been through, baby
But seeing you reminds me of the precious times we've had

[Chorus]
And I wondered all this time 'bout how you been
And I hoped by chance, I'd see you once again
I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again
I'd love to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin

[Verse 2]
I know you got someone and I got somebody too
But I'm unhappy and I miss the shit we used to do
I miss your smile, your mouth, your laughter, baby
Never bumped into your kind before or after

[Chorus]
And I wondered all this time 'bout how you been
And I hoped by chance I'd see you once again
I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again
I'd love to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin

[Verse 3]
I know you gotta be gettin' back to your own thing
Baby, you got yours I got mine
I hope you know that you could call me, girl, if things change
If you want to we could catch up on some lost time

[Chorus]
And I wondered all this time 'bout how you been
And I hoped by chance I'd see you once again
I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again
I'd love to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin
