[Verse 1]
As the day must have its sun
And the night must have its moon
Sure as both must rise and fall
I'll be there to see you through
Just as long as there is time
I will never leave your side
And if ever that you feel
That my love is not sincere

[Chorus]
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart

[Verse 2]
Like the breeze that blows in June
I will steady keep you cool
This I swear with all that's true
I'll take nothing in place of you
When you're feeling down, down, down
You, my soul, can depend on me
You don't ever have to fear
That my love is not sincere

[Chorus]
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart

[Bridge]
Through the storm, through the rain
I'll come running to ease your pain
Like the rails that cross the trains
Like the blood in your veins

[Chorus]
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart
