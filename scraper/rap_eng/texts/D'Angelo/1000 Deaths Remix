[Verse 1]
Y'all know, the pogonotrophy aficionado
With lyrical theolo-gy in staccato
I used to do music for the kids like Demi Lovato
But I'm grown, now I'm busy writing about what I know
They said she died cause these Pop Hip Hoppers ain't got soul
She tried not to grow as she got old
Instead she got sold, the hand of the industry caught hold, then got inside so
You see her moving that don't means she's alive though
You know, the chick Nas essentially called a ho
A cougar recruiting lost souls with so called "hot flows"
To sell to the snot-nosed, I'm not those
That ain't my lane, let me drive yo, now try to follow
Me as I follow, the Jesus seen in the Bible
Who's not a punk
The Jewish Messiah who only died once
Stared death in the face, ate it, then got up days later, like "Mary do not touch"
Met His peeps at the sea like "I got brunch"
I know you been sleeping on me
It's kinda lonely to lead a flock where nobody's going
And even heads who are with the vision ain't got it homie
I'm tempted to follow trends and do what somebody told me
But I ain't one of them shook one
A coward dies a thousand times, I'll follow the book son
Now hit em with the hook once

[Hook]
And if I charge it to the game before
Every time I slip into the unknown
Well, that's only when the spot gets blown
It's war
That is the Lord!
I won't nut up when we up thick in the crunch
Because a coward dies a thousand times
But a soldier only dies just once
Once, once

[Verse 2]
More than a rapper I'm a musician, I make music and you listen
No acapella cyphas where dudes abuse spitting
They hard with the bars but no proof of true rhythm
They forgot about the Dj, so where they from then?
These battle rappers got about half of a kit Kat, and them 2 lil bars are sweet
They don't spar, they tweet
And barely rhyme the lines got a common denominator
Go on and say it bruh I'm a hater, I'm not afraid of
Backlash, but when you say it try finish without a hashtags
Before the low pass on the trap track
You're scared to be different, I bare its resemblance
Peep the radio then come back and compare when you listen
No cookie cutters around, no clones to be found
I started underground homie, and that's below the bottom
You know I got em, a beard, bars and bible
Cultural contributions, grey hairs, and disciples
Fuel for revolution, cause for a revival
Maybe, it's not a dream if it's tangible you can call me crazy
I ain't going pop for nobody so I can hate me
Or tarnish my legacy for the money and fame to change me
Conformity to the industry is something I'm not a part of
Their messengers get kicked in the well like "THIS IS SPARTA!"
I'm not afraid of the monster
I attack on Titans, giants get slain and conquered

[Hook]
And if I charge it to the game before
Every time I slip into the unknown
Well, that's only when the spot gets blown
It's war
That is the Lord!
I won't nut up when we up thick in the crunch
Because a coward dies a thousand times
But a soldier only dies just once
Once, once
