[Verse 1]
Take a toke of smoke from me as you dream inside
Let your days slip away come with me and ride
My darling you aren't the average kind
You need the comfort of my loving
To bring out the best in you
I hope that you do
See what you've given to me
Separating, debating, stay with me that's all you have to do

[Chorus]
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(No way) It ain't that easy
(No way) To walk away
(Just stay) When I want you to stay, baby
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
It ain't that easy
(Okay) Ow ow ow

[Verse 2]
Ever hit with a choice that you can't decide?
Which direction left or right
Shut your mouth off and focus on what you feel inside
See y'all know I'ma go with my vibe
You won't believe all the things you have to sacrifice
Just to get peace of mind
And you take what they give as if it did suffice
Still it's just a waste of time
I offer you the truth
You need the comfort of my loving to bring out the best in you
I wanna give you give you something to feed your mind
No separating, no don't debate it
Faithfully we'll see this love through

[Chorus]
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(No way) It ain't that easy
(No way) To walk away
(Just stay) When I want you to stay, baby
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
It ain't that easy
(Okay) Ow ow ow

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I tell you this sincerely
I need the comfort of your loving
To bring out the best in me
I'm gonna keep you
Safe from evil opinion
What I got can't duplicate it
Faithfully we'll see this love through

[Chorus]
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(No way) It ain't that easy
