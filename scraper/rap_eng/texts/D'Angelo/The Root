[Verse 1]
She done worked a root, done worked a root
That will not be reversed, yeah, no
Then I go on, go on my role in her play
With no rehearsal

[Verse 2]
Said, I left my mojo left my mojo
In my favorite suit, yes I did, yeah
She left a stain, left a dirty stain in my heart
I can't refute, oh I can't, no I can't

[Chorus]
She done worked a root
In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine
From the Alpha to creation, to the end of time, yeah
To the end of time

[Verse 3]
Said, I went, said I went, said I went to the doctor
The man told me there ain't nothin' wrong with me
But I beg to differ, I been feelin' this pain
For much too long, oh, yeah

[Verse 4]
I feel like my soul is empty
My blood is cold and I can't feel my legs
I need someone to hold me
Bring me back to life before I'm dead
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
She done worked a root, root, root
In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine
From the Alpha to creation, to the end of time, time
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 5]
I feel my soul is empty
My blood is cold and I can't feel my legs
I need someone to hold me
Bring me back to life before' I'm dead, dead, dead

[Chorus]
She done worked a root
In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine
From the Alpha to creation, to the

In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine
From the Alpha to creation, to the

In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine
From the Alpha to creation, to the

In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine
From the Alpha to creation, to the

In the name of love and war took my shield and sword
From the pit of the bottom, that knows no floor
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine
From the Alpha to creation, to the end of time
Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine
From the Alpha to creation, to the end of time
