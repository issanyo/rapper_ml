[Verse 1]
In a world where we all circle the fiery sun
With a need for love
What have we become?
Tragedy flows unbound and there's no place to run
'Til it's done
Questions that call to us, we all reflect upon:
Where do we belong? Where do we come from?
Questions that call to us, we all reflect upon
'Til it's done

'Til it's done


[Verse 2]
Carbon pollution is heating up the air
Do we really know? Do we even care?
Acid rain drips on our trees and in our hair
Are you there?
Clock ticking backwards on things we've already built
Sons and fathers die, soldiers, daughters killed
Question ain't "do we have resources to rebuild?"
It's "do we have the will?"

[Verse 3]
Perilous dissidence evening up the score
Do we even know what we're fighting for?
Destinies crippled and thrown about on the floor
When we're waging war
Questions that call to us, we all reflect upon:
Where do we belong? Where do we come from?
Questions that call to us, we all reflect upon
'Til it's done

[Refrain]
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala

'Til it's done
