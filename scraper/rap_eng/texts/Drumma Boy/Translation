Holiday season!

[Verse 1]
I need a motherfucking translator
My plug is a Mexican
We talk so many numbers, we put
Numbers into sentences
15, 16, 17.5. Price too high? I won't buy
You can get a G off every key if
You go off the white. Im from dope city
North Memphis, nigga, look it up
38108 with pots and pans, we just
Cook it up. Them lame niggas try to
Imitate the swag, but the dope boys
Shit, I got a ?
The goons in your bushes
All the money in the world, man, I bet
You still a pussy
The hood's bilingual, the bitch is foreign
?, I just keep it going

[Gucci Mane]
The tats on my face tell my niggas where we be
The tats on my back show my bitches I'm a G
Translates to 1 + 2 = 3
1 key for you, and one pound for me
Translation, calculation, translation, calculation
Abbreviation: more money for me
More under the seat
Translation, calculation, translation, calculation
Abbreviation: more money for me
More under the seat
