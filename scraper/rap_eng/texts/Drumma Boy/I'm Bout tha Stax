[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout the swag, I'm 'bout the ice, I'm 'bout to cop me one tonight
I don't really care the price, cause my bankroll right
Ridin on Toyola, on Pinolla, that's just how we get it though
Choppin ola, I was holdin, forty-five, listen doe
Forty-five to get stashed to buy them new Dickie's man
And a S.O.D. charm piece, man that's fifty grand
Arab tatted up and gathered up the whole guap
S.O.D. gang six figures quarter million copped, cause

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm 'bout the cars, I'm 'bout the swag
I'm 'bout the whip, I'm 'bout the rag
I'm 'bout the bricks, I'm 'bout the flips
I'm 'bout the chips, I'm 'bout the dips
I'm 'bout the stacks.. tall stacks.. stacks
I'm 'bout the stacks.. stacks.. stacks

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout the bank, I'm 'bout to vault
I'm bout the this ain't what you thought
I'm ridin clean, I got guap
I'm doin me I'm on the top
I'm 'bout the ice, I'm 'bout the shine
I'm 'bout the work, I'm 'bout the grind
I'm 'bout to get 'em, got 'em, see 'em, saw
Gettin every dollar doe
When you see me pop your collar
I'ma throw out every dollar
Soulja Boy's not a scholar, bank is full of million dollars
Get 'em S.O.D. we got 'em, scream S.O.D. we holla
Too much swag yes we ballin I'm a money hauler

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Man I'm a trapaholic rapaholic hustler
Down on your decimal, make me a customer
S.O.D. machine don't need no cash register
All the money added up, pass me the duffle
Bag full of grands, a couple bands, understand
I'm the man when I land overseas in Japan
I seen you wishin he'da quit it you can't get like me
A lot of rappers mad cause they can't make no hits like me

[Chorus]
