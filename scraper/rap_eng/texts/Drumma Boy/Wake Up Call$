(Verse 1, Scotty ATL)
Money call my phone in the morning i dont sleep, got insomnia i feel when dat struggle shit get deep, and i try not cloud my brain wit no issues ova money, almost lost all of my friends and i think its ova, when my son wake up boy that clock start again, brush my teeth grab my strap, time to go get the benjamins, niggas ain't waiting round for shit, niggas tryna grind in feed fam, i dont seen dese niggas join a crew, just to mess up a nigga plans, ball out young nigga, ain't where i wanna be, close my eyes and imagine what i wanna see, for the niggas on dey last sack keep pushing, bitch niggas keep looking, 12 get on ya ass, throw dat work in dem bushes 

(Hook, Carlos Syl)
