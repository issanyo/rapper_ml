[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it
It's just gonna be me and you together
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
All of your rent paid, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
No matter where you are, you the shit, babe, when I love you

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, I'm just grindin' in the spotlight
All these people in our business, shit is not right
I'm from where they get the check and they cop ice
All them other niggas, girl, that's what I'm not like
Got her wet like we fuckin' in the rain, though
Goin' hard, pourin' out champagne on her
Shawty flew that pussy straight to me
Steph Curry, long range, though
She said it's worth it for the niggas who treat her right
She made that nigga body bag that shit for life
But for me, she 'bout to hop up on a flight
She seein' shit she ain't never seen in her life
Like 10 girls, sex, love, pain, oh
She call me Daddy like the shit's my first name, no
It's one on one so she climbin' up on top of me
No cameras, we ain't worried 'bout the fame, no

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it (Ride, ride)
It's just gonna be me and you together
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
Fuck what that bitch say, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
You know that you that bitch, babe, when I love you

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Half a mil' for the deal, let's go (Let's go)
I fuck her so good, she can't keep it on the low
She got ass, damn, was leanin' to the floor (To the floor)
And I be ridin' in that demon down the road (Skrrt)
Young nigga pullin' up in a new city (Yeah)
I can tell she get around, I ain't stupid (I ain't stupid)
She say she dance, don't think I'm clueless (No)
I'm so fresh, need a girl that's exclusive
The model types get hit, that's easy (Easy)
One shot, pass her off to C Breezy (CB)
Told her after sleepin' on this Live & Grow shit (Yeah)
That's what she told me, the game needs me (Woo)
She in a bathin' suit, poppin' tryna please me (Yeah)
And she boppin' like, who are you CV? (Oh)
A young nigga from the block, girl
Always change the spot, I'ma always have a spot, you can't leave me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it (Ride)
It's just gonna be me and you together
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
Pay for your rent, babe, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
You know that you that bitch, babe, when I love you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Whatever you buy, it's okay
I see you trying on that dress, pick up them J's for me
Spend it all on you, all for you, let's go all the way
This girl gon' leave right now, you got me, going crazy, girl, I'm out of my mind
Must not know me, I can't hit it one time, girl, you know I gotta come back
'Cause you blow my mind, along with other things
And can we go round three? Don’t waste this time wasting time
Break that body down and do a slow wine just for me 'cause I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don’t have to leave, so I'm gonna stay over
Climb on top of me and just ride, just ride it (Ride)
It's just gonna be me and you together
One on one when I love you, babe, one on one when I love you, babe
I ain’t worried ’bout shit, babe, when I love you
Pay for your rent, babe, when I love you
Give you all of my shit, babe, when I love you
You know that you that bitch, babe, when I love you
