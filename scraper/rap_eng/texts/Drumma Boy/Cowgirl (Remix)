Giddy up
READY FOR YOUR Love
Baby here I come
Give it up for your cowgirl

(Chorus)
Giddy up
I can't get enough
Let me see you buck
Give it up for your cowgirl
D-d-d-d-d-dun dun  dun dun
And I'm riding like a cowgirl

[Verse 1:Darnaa]
Up in the party
You all up on me
Must be a stallion
Dont need a pony
Look like a winner
I'm betting on me
Say you gone show me
Hope I ain't disappointed
Cuz I'm looking for a ride
Shawty I see the way you giving me the eye
I hope by the end of the night
That You gone have me saying
Oh na na na na

(Chorus)
Giddy up
Ready for your love
Baby here I come
Give it up for your cowgirl
Giddy up
I can't get enough
Let me see you buck
Give it up for your cowgirl
D-d-d-d-Dun-dun
And I'm riding like a cowgirl

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
He said he love it when I ride it, like I ride a bike
I said if you riding it
Than ma, you better ride it right
Cuz I'm one of a kind, they can can try to copy
It's Remy Ma a-k-a Mrs.Kawasaki
So just put your helmet on
Now baby sit back
This gone be a great adventure
Call me Six Flags
I do it so good
I mean I'm so bad
Backwards, or forwards
See lil Daddy, no hands
I can drop it low , Or pick it up fast
I'm flexible I can touch my toes
Then pop into a handstand
Said she gone take my man
Really? Tell me how girl
When I d-d-dun-dun-dun, ride it like a cowgirl?

(Chorus)
