[Verse 1]
Roller coaster love, up and down she go
Everyday this chick tripping in and out the door
Yeah I keep these bitches high, got it for the low
Out in France last month, but where I'm 'bout to go?
I don't know, got too high a while ago
I be chasing money, whip that big seat hundred domino
Pull up on your bitch and do the street nigga on a hoe
Pull up on your bitch, they love a street nigga, that's for sure
Ha ha, too silly, amigo on for really
There's an eagle on my belly, I been bumping Makaveli
Then I switch it up, Dekeli, fuck your bitch up in the telly
Jump right back in the Chevy, ain't no telling where I'm heading

[Chorus]
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Okay, bitches love me cause I keep that shit 100
They drop it like it's hot, I'm the number 1 stunner
When I throw that money, that pussy, it come up
9 millimetre, acting dummy if they run up
Okay you see it's OHB, we out here stacking, stacking
All this molly, all these bitches, all this ass I'm smacking
I'm tripping, drinking 'til I'm pissy
Fuck your girl with my girl, yeah nigga cause I'm different
I'm 'bout my money, money and power, respect my clique, gon' throw it up
When I'm in the club making it shower, doing it BIG in LA, okay
That's why they call me Big Poppa, notorious to that pussy
None of y'all niggas can see me so why the fuck you still looking?

[Chorus]
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster

[Verse 3]
Pulled up with your bitch, with your bitch like okay
She gon' help me count the bands but she won't see the safe
Got that killer pussy, put that cat up in the cage
You know I'm a dog, can't keep that pussy out my face
Fuck with me, know you're going up, know them niggas ain't showing up
VVS', bitch we ain't stressing, night time, a nigga going up
Flipping birds, check the wing span, bet a mil when my team playing
Better yet put the house on it, shut you mouth and put your mouth on it

[Chorus]
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, up and down she go
Gone, I'm roller coasting in and out the door
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
Gone, roller coaster, roller coaster
