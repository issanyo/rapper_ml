Yeah, I guess that's what it sounds like
When you're in your L7, gas'd up and all
Ready to take flight, I'm taking off baby
Let's go!
You got your window down, shoes out the window
Saying you ain't got these!
I guess you feel like umm like

[Hook]
I'm fresh from my fitted to my toes
I'm fresh didn't know, now you know
I'm fresh from the press in my jeans
So it seems that clean's in my genes
So I'm fresh to death

I'm fresh from the ceiling to the floor
I'm fresh from the wall to the door
I'm fresh from the mid to the east
From the west to the south
You ain't gotta read my mouth
I'm fresh

[Verse 1]
Step up in the door like "yes, that's me." Looking kinda fresh in a fresh white tee
With a hoodie over and a fresh press jeans, New Era fitted and some fresh Jet Li's
Fresh from my toes to my H-E-D, Can't forget the "A", man I say I'm clean
Looking at a king, call him S-E-Z, gotta say "Sez" don't pronounce his C's
Best in the biz, that kid is me, from the mid-W-E-S-T
Cause believe indeed, not impressed by the press when they press my team
They try to put me down in the ground like seeds, Didn't know I'll grow into a great MC
Now I'm getting stacks of the G-R-een, On the side of my jeans so I guess it's seam
I'm fresh from the front to the back, from the side to side, I ride like a kid on a bike
Always had pride in my eye when my in eye in the middle like pride full of cries of the fight
Don't stop, don't stop, I get it, I get it like G-E-T I-T
Like Lucas I'm just being Frank and I'm spraying Tom Hanks if you think I'm not B-I-G
Never seen a dude so cool, cause I'm feeling like a winter in the middle of your pool
Number one like pee, so I never been a "Q", Staying on the ish but I never been a two
Now the person in the flesh had the game down to a tee, put me to the test
If you can't really tell, you should tell I'm the best, from the F to the H
And the rest

[Hook]
