[Chorus]
Say, you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely, you don't even know me
That's why I no longer want to be a stranger

[Verse 1]
Sorry you put your trust in others and they let you down
And all the the secrets and unknown evidence now in the open that you found
Cried yourself to sleep so many nights, said you'd never again
I'm not the one you hold it against, baby, it's not my blame

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you independent as hell
And doing it by yourself
But what you gon' do when the night time get cold?
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing
I'm stubborn

[Chorus]
'Cause you say you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I want the title of your closest friend, baby
I no longer want to be a stranger
Tell me
What I gotta do (what I gotta do)
What I gotta do
What I gotta do (anything I gotta do)
What I gotta do, what I gotta do (tell me)
What I gotta do

[Verse 2]
You're stuck inside, no matter how hard you try to forget
Don't you wish there was a button we can reset and make it easy
But you can't take back the decision that you made to love
I know it's one that you regret and not too proud of
Because you keep telling me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you independent as hell
And doing it by yourself
But what you gon' do when the night time get cold?
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely
You don't even know me
I ain't moving out the way for nothing
I'm stubborn

[Chorus]
'Cause you say you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I want the title of your closest friend, baby
I no longer want to be a stranger
Baby, tell me
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do (what I gotta, baby, tell me)
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do

[Bridge]
I remember the break-up
And the condition that my heart was in
But I would never surrender, no, no
I gotta be stronger, there's nothing time can't heal
Girl, I know your scarred
All I ask is a chance to come in and do my part
It's nothing but fear and you been holding on since
Too under pressure and I see you sinking in

[Chorus]
Say, you'd never give away your heart again
I'll be knocking till you let me in
I know you told me you'd rather be lonely, you don't even know me
That's why I no longer want to be a stranger
What I gotta do (what I gotta do)
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do, what I gotta do
What I gotta do
