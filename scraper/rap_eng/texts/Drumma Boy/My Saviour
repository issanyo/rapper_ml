[Intro]
It’s Snap “The Writer”
Church
R.T.B. in the building

[Hook]
My Savior, Jehovah God is (7x)
My Savior, Jehovah God

[Interlude]
I ain’t all that holy but a
I’m trying to get there

[1st Verse]
Dear Lord thank you for bringing me your shield of salvation
I’m still patient
And waiting
And thinking
About your love
So thank you Lord for all of the above
You made my day way much better than what it was
And with the strength you have girded me
Even though that my verses be
Iller and sicker than a new born that’s yawning and just coughing all through the churches seats
As long as I am living I will continue to work for he
That done died on the cross for the sins of people that weren’t free
It’s only he
That keeps my faith higher than the top of a fig tree
Cause he brings peace
He forgives see
The Lord that is
The Lord’s a hit
So I’ll continue to praise and just bless the Lord of gifts
Best believe he recorded this
Reading the bible is one of the main steps to start believing in him
Cause it’s his testimony and proof that proves that he is winning
It’s only God that could fight the gravity we is living
While some people a fight for the amount of love that he is getting

[Hook]
My Savior, Jehovah God is (7x)
My Savior, Jehovah God

[2nd Verse]
It’s like I lived in the biblical times
I’m not only lyrical I’m
Preaching Christ for savior
In front of haters
And hoping God awakes them
I’m spiritually rich so I’m hoping that God saves us
Through the suffer and the pain while I’m working for that paper
Preaching to the folks the gospel
In any city that I know
Cause God wants me to be holy and on his side yo
Instead of living the fast life I’m gone die old
And bold
I’m wise so if they ask tell em that I told
You to focus on the positive and read the bible
For answers to your questions
I am not a living legend
But I am one of those guys that let you know that there is heaven
Whenever you follow preacher’s sermons
Then you will begin to learn it
You could throw away the false statement by preaching in churches
To some going to church is
The purpose
Of hiding what’ll happen behind the curtains
We got to go find his words and
Just share it with others who are in need of the Lord of service
I’m a still carry this grateful act
And still remain as grateful as
These grateful dads
That do the opposite of wearing hateful masks
Me as a Christian dawg I’m a face the fact
That having the holy spirit’ll keep you far from the heart that a hater has
I only listen to musicians and rhythms of faithful rappers
And tracks that remind us
And keep us right where the faith is at
As a Christian dawg I will never be ashamed to brag
About the type of things that the savior has
Blessed me with
And if I’m serving God it maybe just
Cause my savior is very rich
In his spirit whenever I worship him for his daily gifts

[Hook]
My Savior, Jehovah God is (7x)
My Savior, Jehovah God

[3rd Verse]
I shout to God with loud songs of joy
Whenever I am on record
I’m going to score
With Jesus in my life like I was on the court
Because I got sins that I mention
When asking God for forgiveness
This just how Christ brought me back to remembering
That when you sin
You don’t win
Sinning is never gone end
I won’t bend or break because Jesus is still my own friend
I’m understanding words in sight
Understanding the words in Christ
Jehovah God blessed my life
Jehovah God blessed my sight
And I’m a praise his name till I make it to Heaven’s porch
This the season of praising his name and making the heaven roar
I’ll continue to bless his glorious name
So things could change
And rearrange
In front of me
And just ease to get better boy
And while the devil’s trying to find more of Jesus people to clone
I pray to God for him to stop and leave Jesus people alone
And some people oftenly hate the fact they can’t speak on the phone
With God about the situations and problems that’s going on

[Hook]
My Savior, Jehovah God is (7x)
My Savior, Jehovah God
