(feat. Afficial, Halleluyah, Master P)

[Master P]
T-R-U
Silkk, you in here?
No Limit 4 Life
I got this, see this
I got the hood on my back nigga
Walk with me

[Chorus x4]
Throw your rags in the air, we back my nigga
I can smell a championship like Shaq, my nigga
You bitches try to stop us, You hoes, you can't harm me
The New No Limit is every street nigga army

[Master P]
My pops told me "Fall off your bike, then you get back up"
Represent your hood, nigga throw your shit up
You don't snitch, you go to jail, thats the codes of the street
They got a gun to your head, want chu to talk, man put me to sleep
Before I tell war stories, or snitch on my homies
Testify in the court room, man these niggas are phony
What happened to old days? Nigga die for iron
I know some niggas in my hood that'd fucking tell on they mama
I only roll with a chosen few, a chosen crew
Like Boz, Hot Boy, Drumma, Afficial, Diesel, and Hallelu
You gotta respect the niggas that stay silent
Like Corey, El and Vee, my niggas on Rikers Island
Them niggas that ain't gonna represent No Limit
Like Longhead, Paul Hall, Meat, Marlo, and Jimmy
C-Murder doin a bid and didn't do the crime
You see my niggas don't snitch if they life on the line

[Chorus]
[S-Flames]
Ay look
I never liked the navy so I joined the army
Been rocking my soulja rag since they made atari
Won't speak to bitch niggas, don't like it to draw
I got an eye problem, can't see me fucking with cha'll
I know I said it once dawg before but now I'm sayin it clearer
If you wanna see a snitch bitch, look in the mirror
No Limit is the army, We some soldiers til we die
Pistol Pete give me the word, you know I'm gonna ride goodbye

[Desperado]
I enrolled in the army, I ain't looked back since
I was on the block long like ten sharp prints
Used to hustle off the porch, we ain't have no fence
Mask on, no gloves, they ain't have no prints
Nigga I turn a slice of bread into a loaf
We live death before dishonor, I'ma stick to the oath
It's a fact, the fiends want needles and smack
I'ma hustle until I got more diesel than Shaq

[Chorus]
[Yukon]
Errbody listenin so I put something in they ear
They think P Millers just something that I wear
Yeah, its the connection that we got
Thats real enough for us to come out the booth
And make it best to the block
So why stop when we got everything move along?
Hear me speak more than once, its usually a song
And eventhough we in the playing field
They say a ball or car won't kill you but a hater will
My meal ticket just starting to cash in
Breathin, keep moving when I'm on my last wind
Everybody start from the bottom
Til you find yourself chasing everything til you run into problems

[Halleluyah]
I got street credibility, every hood, they feelin me
Every good deliveries white tan, them christmas trees
I right hand religiously beat down my enemies
Peep how I end it these weak lames listen
I speak flames and lyrically heat brains
I'm physically untame
You need a little more help mayne
Cause this 45 unlocked and aimed
My gun cocked and banged
This shit is bad for your health mayne

[Chorus]
[Master P]
I know y'all street niggas out there
Appreciate a nigga coming from the motherfucking hood
And doing something else
But y'all young niggas thats taking the game and fucking it up
Nigga I was out there hustling before most of y'all motherfuckers was in school ya heard
Kids under me, churn, glorifying getting shot, Real niggas dodge bullets
Banging on wax, Man niggas down in the hood behind money
Motherfucking the rap game, fucking it up
Then the snitches fucking up the dope game
We gonna bring the shit back to reality though, ya heard me
Don't make me pull my belt off and whip one of these little bitches
