[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on exotic, my girl ain't got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I ask her is she working, she ask me do I want it
I say when I went to school bitch money was the subject

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around on my side of town, boxing gloves I beat the trial
I had the coke I had a smile, I had a coat for every style
Crocodile the gator type, I'm allergic to the hater type
I take ya wife, give her back, 9 months after that, SIMILAC!
Similar the saying, mama's baby daddy's maybe
When we had sex I was in a Mercedes
And I ain't crazy, but if that's my baby
Then we gonna have to name the little baby Mercedes
The money that I'm making I don't see you like I'm blind
I'd rather spend money baby I don't spend time
My pockets on full, and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm riding around on my side of town wit' my dubs up and my window down
It's the king homie I'm on one, them suckers know they don't want none
Steady repping that one son, Bankhead, Cedar Hills
I'm on Simpson Road and I'm going over to pick up some dough from in Adamsville
My seat white, my paint tight, spray candy red the same at the wheel
Got a bag of pills in my stash spot, steady whipping them racks out
Got a quarter-mil in my Louis bag if you wanna know what that sack 'bout
Still rep for them have-nots, try me homie you assed out
I got Striver's Row in my denim tag and Akoo shit, new kicks
Supersport on deuces, bumping that Trap Muzik
I'm super-paid, I'm Gucci, 2 cute chicks who do tricks
Stay out of my business, when I'm riding around and I'm getting it

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
I'm riding around and I'm getting it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
It's mine, I spend it, it's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it, I'm riding around and I'm getting it
