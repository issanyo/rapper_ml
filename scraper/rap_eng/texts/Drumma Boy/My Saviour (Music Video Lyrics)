[Intro]
It’s Snap “The Writer”
Church
R.T.B. in the building

[Hook]
My Savior, Jehovah God is (7x)
My Savior, Jehovah God

[Interlude]
I ain’t all that holy but a
I’m trying to get there

[1st Verse]
Dear Lord thank you for bringing me your shield of salvation
I’m still patient
And waiting
And thinking
About your love
So thank you Lord for all of the above
You made my day way much better than what it was
And with the strength you have girded me
Even though that my verses be
Iller and sicker than a new born that’s yawning and just coughing all through the churches seats
As long as I am living I will continue to work for he
That done died on the cross for the sins of people that weren’t free
It’s only he
That keeps my faith higher than the top of a fig tree
Cause he brings peace
He forgives see
The Lord that is
The Lord’s a hit
So I’ll continue to praise and just bless the Lord of gifts
Best believe he recorded this
Reading the bible is one of the main steps to start believing in him
Cause it’s his testimony and proof that proves that he is winning
It’s only God that could fight the gravity we is living
While some people a fight for the amount of love that he is getting

[Hook]
My Savior, Jehovah God is (7x)
My Savior, Jehovah God

[2nd Verse]
I shout to God with loud songs of joy
Whenever I am on record
I’m going to score
With Jesus in my life like I was on the court
Because I got sins that I mention
When asking God for forgiveness
This just how Christ brought me back to remembering
That when you sin
You don’t win
Sinning is never gone end
I won’t bend
Or break because Jesus is still my own friend
I’m understanding words in sight
Understanding the words in Christ
Jehovah God blessed my life
Jehovah God blessed my sight
And I’m a praise his name till I make it to Heaven’s porch
This the season of praising his name and making the heaven roar
I’ll continue to bless his glorious name
So things could change
And rearrange
In front of me
And just ease to get better boy
And while the devil’s trying to find more of Jesus people to clone
I pray to God for him to stop and leave Jesus people alone
And some people oftenly hate the fact they can’t speak on the phone
With God about the situations and problems that’s going on

[Hook]
My Savior, Jehovah God is (7x)
My Savior, Jehovah God
