The definition of a real nigga
Ask about me, they gonna see I keep it real, nigga
Young thug, keeping racks from behind the wall
I ain't even gotta ask, she gonna drop a droll
I ain't even gotta ask, I make the fucking laws
Being known from the back, take this fucking low
Dollar bill and gold packs, never fucking low
And I watch my trap jump like a fucking frog

[Verse 1:]
Ready? All this money is my ID
Gs on the watch, you see it before you see me
I'm on the L like the TV
Kush got me high, you fuck niggas can't reach me
Uh, you fuck niggas can't teach me
Ask around the hood, young Turk, I'm an OG
Ride around your hood at anytime at a slow speed
I'm stacking money and it's higher than a nosebleed
Yeah, getting high near shawty
Get without a deal, I'm getting high, lil shawty
Take a microscope just to see you niggas balling
All this cash got your main bitch calling

[Hook:]
Uh, it is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
If you're looking at me, then, you're looking at the real
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
If you're looking at me, then, you're looking at the real

[Verse 2:]
Turn it on, what it do, what the deal real?
I'm a show you niggas what the fuck the real is
All my nigga Turk for nessin, why you stressin?
Will come till that chess, instead they're counting all my blessings
Bunk home nesting, they're warming with a woman
I want my lucie g fat and you won't say nothing to 'em
But now is what you call at the swear tone
Get the cable on, I'm a let that bad tone
Put that one hundred Gs in, I'm a buy a Gs in
And yet the shit hard, I just make it look easy
Fifty thousand for the Rolly, watch it front the digit
Said it, I ain't with your bitch, I might grab a digit

[Hook:]
Uh, it is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
If you're looking at me, then, you're looking at the real
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
If you're looking at me, then, you're looking at the real

[Verse 2:]
I had a chat with the mirror on the wall
And she said that I am the realest of them all
My cash right, my stash righ, look at that bitch ball
I balls right like car right, with Lil Joe and hustle
You ain't never been no snitch
I ain't never been no will
Make my own money, my own laws, ain't never get no pill
Fuck with me, I might trip, lose my mind, just might flip
Convicted fellow with no mel, but my real niggas got clips
I'm so sorry to find, so genuine, for the money I'm so anxious
Got thing for the link and despite of that, you're brainless
And I don't talk to strangers, oh, no, you ain't post soon
Main women go way back, still sucking with my all crew

[Hook:]
Uh, it is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
If you're looking at me, then, you're looking at the real
It is what it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
If you're looking at me, then, you're looking at the real
