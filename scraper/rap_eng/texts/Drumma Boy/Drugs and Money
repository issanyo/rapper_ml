[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I just been waitin' to fuck 'em up, ayy
We run in your shit with a ski mask, that's a wrap
Them blue bands in the duffel bag, them the benjamins, oh
Turn this bitch up, what they gon' say?
My Rollie flooded, this a bustdown, that's a sixty piece, lil' bitch
I'm in my city clothes, I ain't changed clothes for the ride
I'm on my hustle shit, I done re-upped on the block
Fuck up the winter, fuck up the summer, lil' bitch I be comin'
I came from drugs and money
What these bitches be wantin' from me?
What these haters be wantin' from me?
Got the foreigns in line, we stuntin'
From Downtown way to Uptown
They be screamin' my name, I'm stuntin'
We came to just turn up
We gon' stunt on 'em, we gon' rob you bitches

[Chorus]
I came from drugs and money
I came from drugs and money
I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
I came from drugs and money
I came from drugs and money
What you pussies be wantin' from me?
What you pussies be wantin' from me?
I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
I came from drugs and money

I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs

[Verse 2]
Youngin, we gettin' it
We causin' a problem, problem
Bitch I'm on fire, fire
I'm gettin' hella bands on the road
Drug money, drug money
Bitches pop off, shoot you in the face
Young nigga from the projects
I ain't had nothin', I was dead weight
I was tired of bein' dead broke, ayy
Now I'm poppin', you can fast forward, ayy
A couple bricks in the Concord, ayy
A few partners in the graveyard, ayy
I come from drugs and money
Been around the town, I'm stuntin'
My lil' partners, they ridin' for me
Ain't no playin' it, time is money
I'ma chill and grind this summer
Got a mil on my mind this summer
I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs

[Chorus]
I came from drugs and money
I came from drugs and money
I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
I came from drugs and money
I came from drugs and money
What you pussies be wantin' from me?
What you pussies be wantin' from me?
I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
I came from drugs and money

I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs

Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs

I came from drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs
