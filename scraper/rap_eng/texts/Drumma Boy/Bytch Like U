[Intro]
Bitch like you (Bitch like you)
I need a bitch like you (Bitch like you)
I need a bitch like you (Bitch like you)
I need a bitch like you (Bitch like you)

[Verse 1]
This time the bitch is up
She keep it on the keep
And if I ever need it
She keep a couple stacks
She on my dream team
She know how to get your cream
She know how to use her grind
That's so sexy to me
She my Michelle Obama
She bumbee with no drama
And she's no Vera Findle
When I smoke marijuana
I'm her big teddy bear
She like to hold me close
When I'm up in that thang
I like to overdose
She my lil' baby girl
Take her all around the world
She point and say I want that
I tell her here it is
Cause She my lil' baby girl
Take her all around the world
She point and say I want that
I tell her here it is

[Hook]

Every nigga need a bitch like you (like you)

[Verse 2]
Lobsters and crabs legs
Stake and sushi
Stay home, rent a DVD
Or go out and catch a movie
From head to toe she kill him
Keep them bitches talkin'
Them broke niggers howl
And she just keeps on walkin'
She don't be actin' funny
She just be 'bout her money
She knows who got this for real
She know who we're just stuntin'
She hung with hustle bitches
Bitches that hustle hard
Put a nigga behind bars
She argue with them stars
But she ain't no groupie shit 'em
Niggers be jokin' her
We go to the strip club
Bitches be watchin' her
Cause she ain't no groupie shit 'em
Niggers be jokin' her
We go to the strip club
Bitches be watchin' her
