It ain't trickin if you got it
And I got it
So bad I just wanna take a shot (I got it)
Later on hit the club and get it poppin
Girl I told you it ain't trickin if you got it
I got it (you got it) I got it (I want it)
So bad I wanna see you in the mornin (I got it)
So bad I wanna see you when you moanin
You can have whatever if you want it
Cause baby I got it I got it I got it I got it
Cause baby I got it I got it I got it I got it

Hop up in a whip and get out of here
I can turn your wrist into a chandelier
You can go where I go, I go where you won't go
Trips to Acapulco, probably cause I got dough
Baby I got game though, I am not a lame-o
Gucci Gucci Gucci, baby come up out that rainbow
Swag to the left to the right with me
And I can cover your body with Louis V
Fantasy fulfilled if you come with me
And I'll introduce you to a lavish live of luxury
It's just you and me, wherever we go
I wanna know is the one to stow
And I'm spending the dough
Tell me what's going to break me
Receipts so long, mayn, he thinking I'm crazy
If you were my baby
You could have anything I got it
Just take a card out my wallet

It ain't trickin if you got it
And I got it
So bad I just wanna take a shot (I got it)
Later on hit the club and get it poppin
Girl I told you it ain't trickin if you got it
I got it (you got it) I got it (I want it)
So bad I wanna see you in the mornin (I got it)
So bad I wanna see you when you moanin
You can have whatever if you want it
Cause baby I got it

Shorty got that good good mayn I gotta have it
Ass so fat mayn I just wanna grab it
That's a bad habit Excuse my hand
I wanna kidnap you, baby, change of plans Monday is Germany, Tuesday Japan
Wednesday is Italy, Thursday is France
Friday is yacht day, you and all your friends
Chillin on the coast of Puerto Rico with your man

It ain't trickin if you got it
And I got it
So bad I just wanna take a shot (I got it)
Later on hit the club and get it poppin
Girl I told you it ain't trickin if you got it
I got it (you got it) I got it (I want it)
So bad I wanna see you in the mornin (I got it)
So bad I wanna see you when you moanin
You can have whatever if you want it

It's all on you, tell me what to do
But you gotta tell me before the night is through
It's all on you, tell me what to do
But you gotta tell me before the night is through
I said my time is money, and baby money is time
Baby I got money, I wanna make you mine
I said it's all on you, tell me what to do
But you gotta tell me before the night is through
So I can upgrade to you

It ain't trickin if you got it
And I got it
So bad I just wanna take a shot (I got it)
Later on hit the club and get it poppin
Girl I told you it ain't trickin if you got it
I got it (you got it) I got it (I want it)

Cause baby I got it I got it I got it I got it
Cause baby I got it I got it I got it I got it
Cause baby I got it
