[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm popular and poppin' dough
Breakfast at Pappadeaux's
Dodging all obstacles
Trapping at the Stop-N-Go
Boy you know you lame if you still riding stop and go
Dissect the beat and then I turn it to a particle
Pardon though, I'm harder though
You should read the article
I'm riding high and dodging hoes
You better hope im dodging your
Model hoes dollar hoes, white looking Madonna hoes Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo, and the Prada hoes
College ho Zone 3, niggas with a lot of gold
Snoop guard the door
I just love being by the stove
Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul
Like a comma, I love being right next to O's

[Hook:]
I had a long day
My nerves bad
Yea I'm smoking on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewlery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand
I can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands,i can't help it im addicted to the rubberbands

[Verse 2: J Hard]
We sitting high speaking like we super human beings
Cars mulatto, black on black Europeans
Too hard to swallow like UGKings and
Number one thesis do you believe in Jesus
They say money is the root of all diseases
Well call the docotr I see honest in my thesis
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks
Baby momma saying im impatient my sons need shit
When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips
Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips
In zip locks, and garbage bags
Usher Raymond in this bitch yea I got it bad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz!)
My plug need me, but he greedy
I ran off told me catch me on the TV
See I'm from where you rob Peter to pay Paul
I'm yelling fuck the world I woke up with my dick hard
Big dog, big broads all in my circumference
Pussy on lock down, I dont hand cuff it
Sipping Grey Goose and we spending mad doucets
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds
Gucci flip flops, I got bunyons on bunyons
Yellow ring look like a funyon, or somethin'
I just left the trap house, money on money

[Hook]
