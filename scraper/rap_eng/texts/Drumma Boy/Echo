E-e-Echo

[Verse 1]
You did it to yourself
Now you're all by your self
Acting like you hate me
I left because you made me
You played me to the left
Now there's nobody left
To hear your complaining
I'm gone and all you're hearin' is your own

[Hook]
E-echo!
E-e-echo!
And I'm gone
And your all alone
Can't you hear the hear the
Echo!
E-echo!
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

[Verse 2]
It started off great
But who was to know
That love that is lost
Cannot be let go
You say it's my fault
Ok then i'll go
It's better to know
Now there's nobody to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone hearing your own damn

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Disgusted with trust
I trust no one no more
Just went with the flow
Found myself on the floor
When you went away
All my pain went astray
Like it's a new day
Now I have no one to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone
Hearing your own damn

Echo
Your own damn
E-echo
No one is near you
No one can hear you
With your own damn
Echo!
E-echo!
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

All night long
I thought to myself
Why would I stay with you
Realized that you were the one who had issues
So why would I miss you?

No one to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who you're with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone

Hearing your own damn echo!
It's just you and your
E-echo!
Its just you and your
I hope that yall get along
It's just you and your
Echo!
It's just you and your
E-echo!
There's no one to hear you
There's nobody near you
It's just your own damn
Echo!
Your own damn
E-echo!
Echo!
E-e-echo!
Echo
E-echo
E-e-echo

No one to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!!
