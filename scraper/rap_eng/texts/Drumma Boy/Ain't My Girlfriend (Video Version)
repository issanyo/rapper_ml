[Intro: French Montana & Ty Dolla $ign]
(Drumma Boy)
Montana, $hort what's happenin’?
Dolla $ign, woah, woah, oh yeah

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
That ain't my girlfriend, that's my old bitch
And I can have her any time I want, she love this dick
Oh nigga, you mad, yeah nigga, you pissed
I know she’s stayin' with you, but that's our bitch, woah
Nigga, that's my bitch, nigga, that's my bitch
No matter how much you hate, she's still on my dick
Nigga, I can still hit if I call that bitch
I know I got you mad as fuck, but pimp, don't trip, that's still my bitch

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I seen the homie last night on some fly shit
Had the nerve to introduce me to my bitch
His main bitch is my side bitch
She stayed cool, actin’ like the shy chick
I played it cool too, you know I didn’t say nothin'
’Cause not a lot of people know that me and her be fuckin'
She sent a text, talkin' 'bout, "I see you player"
I see you too, hangin’ out with a square
But that's the type I like
Spend the night but she's not my wife
I fuck her good but I'm not her man
To tell the truth, I just hit it when I can

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
That ain't my girlfriend, that's my old bitch
And I can have her any time I want, she love this dick
Oh nigga, you mad, yeah nigga, you pissed
I know she's stayin' with you, but that's our bitch, woah

[Verse 2: French Montana]
You's a lame and you know that, pussy throwback
If I want it, she won't go back and you know that
Thinkin' that you own that, picture that, Kodak
You cuffin' that, low jack, we smokin' that, more yeah
She want use the money you ain't talkin' 'bout none
Show me your bad bitch, I'll show you nigga, tired of fuckin'
300 the drop, 3 bottles Cîroc
3 models to pop, presidental, Barack
Leanin' in the sport, pimpin' is a sport
Pullin' up with $hort, you niggas money short
Oh that's your hoe? Nigga, that's my hoe too
Heard she used to fuck with Ty, yeah Jeremih too

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Nigga, that's my bitch, nigga, that's my bitch
No matter how much you hate, she's still on my dick
Nigga, I can still hit if I call that bitch
I know I got you mad as fuck, but pimp, don't trip, that's still my bitch

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
See my bitches is bad, so I know it's no problem
Know when he ain't around, prolly when she gon' call me
I know she come to play, she chase me state to state
Swear these niggas be jealous, that's why females trade
She hit me on the phone, say she be home alone
Off Hennessy and Patron, tweetin' 'bout my cologne
I be in New York, fuckin' her to Too $hort
Hit that pussy so good, said she need new pork
Got me drillin' 'cause I'm diggin' on ya
Right now I'm down to pop, gonna lay the pipin' down down
All we do is fuck and smoke and you down
You know it ain't no discussion, that ain't my girlfriend

[Verse 4: Joyner Lucas]
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Yo you don't even got what I be givin'
The truth is you can never hit the spots that I be hittin'
I know she love when I be on top and I be in it
Even when we finish you should hear the props that I be gettin'
I pull up and hit it out front and then I dip when I'm done
Even if ya'll were married I still get hit what I want
Every time that  she near me I'm still gon' get what I want
Break up your happy family and tell you look what I've done
I've gotten dirty now, she gotten flirtier now
She wrote her name on my dick, I putting words in her mouth
When Joyner Lucas in town there's lots to worry about
I mean that's my bitch if you ain't heard in a while

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
That ain't my girlfriend
Nigga, that's my bitch, nigga, that's my bitch
No matter how much you hate, she's still on my dick
Nigga, I can still hit if I call that bitch
I know I got you mad as fuck, but pimp, don't trip, that's still my bitch
