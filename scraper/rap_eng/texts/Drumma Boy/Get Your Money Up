[Verse 1: Giggs]
Imma let 'em 'ave it
Half a box on the scales hurry up and bag it
Bag it, wrap it, tie it, wrap it, wrap it
Shit's moving mad fast hurry up and grab it
We bus it up with magic
Putting too much mix you fucking up the package
Sometimes a brick's mad tough hurry up and smash it
It's like a factory the way we got them packs inside
Had a bad day looking for a strap to buy
And i'm [?] trying to get my stacks to fly
And the is scale fucking up i think the battery died
In the back seat, get my nigga lap to drive
The one that banned me is fucking up my cash supply
Understand me nigga when the packs arrive Imma bust it up and get that fucking maxi size

[Hook]
Get your money up, Nigga get your money up
Get your money up, Nigga get your money up
Get your money up, Get your money up
Get your money up, Nigga get your money up

[Verse 2: Giggs]
See the way I show niggas get their money up
If you know you get it in then put your collar up
Put your pounds up, put your dollars up
Feds tried to jump me but i swallowed them
Fuck that I'm ignoring them
[?] for some 36 more and he borrowed them so i followed him
Well you can get 'em back tomorrow then
Shit's nuts now i got mad people to see
In a rush now, got to meet Peter and Lee
And i got to meet Rita and Stevie for three
Tell 'em all 45 and that's as sweet as can be
Now other niggas trapping looking measly to me
Niggas with some big business want to reason with me
And the reason being cause i got greasiest team
Hollowman, SN1 i brought some [?] to see

[Hook]
Get your money up, Nigga get your money up
Get your money up, Nigga get your money up
Get your money up, Get your money up
Get your money up, Nigga get your money up
