[Verse 1]
If I survived this shit then anybody can
Feel like the whole world against you, well what you do
Daddy smoking that shit and my momma too
Aunty and my uncle too
Remember daddy put momma in da hospital when I was two
Maybe 3, he apologized and bought me some shoes
He always told me he was sorry though
Reflection of my parents
4th grade when I called my teacher a HOE!
Yeah, that's when shit got real
Grandma came got me said
"Fuck yo momma house this is where you live!
You don't talk back or you get slapped
You a fuckin' Child you don't pay bills"
Where I would be without Ida Mae
Only lord knows
God bless her soul

[Verse 2]
1999 My Aunty Bae died
She had one child and that's my big brother
Grew up on the same bed we
Used to fight each other
He the only nigga in the world
That Know my whole my whole struggle
Hell yeah nigga that's my big cuz
He was with me when I flew and went
Got my first plug
Started countin' too much money
And started druggin' hard
Swear to God it fell like its a curse on me and my boys!
My patna fell asleep hit the pole and mt patna died
Couple months later I fell asleep drivin' to the Chi
Final Destination Lord this can't be my last ride
Six years later we flipped ova again nd we still alive!

[Verse 3}

Mom and daddy doin' good
They still together too
I went and bought a crib
And one for them too
Like my uncle Vick I'm the shit
By the way rest in peace to Ida Mae
I'm blessed
