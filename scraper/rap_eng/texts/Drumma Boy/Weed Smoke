[Hook]
Weed smoke
Got me all floatin', weed smoke
Got me all chokin', weed smoke
Got me in my zone
Got me in my
Weed smoke
Got me all floatin', weed smoke
Got me all chokin', weed smoke
Got me in my zone
Got me in my zone

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Project Pata', purple drinka', purple leafa'
Should’ve been a engine, I’m such a chiefa'
Reefa', marijuana, sticky leafa'
Cross me, haircut to the green meter
Beata', murder charge, in the stata'
Let a nigga slide by, like a skater
Paper coming in off the hustle
Money on the wood, make it good off the muscle
Cigarillo, prep it up, no tobacco
Crumble up the medico, out the packo
A wako, weed fiend, dip it in lean
Didn’t have no mollies, for them dollars gave em beans

[Hook]

[Verse]
Smoke two J’s and I pass out, you niggas is amateurs
You can get what I leave behind
You niggas is scavengers
I advise you to keep cool, and keep your parameters
Chopper gun with 50 drum, clean you up like janitor
He adjustin'  the quota, with a school of piranhas
Only thing have me keep my cool – smoking marijuana
And I gotta have mo, cheez then a damn enchilada
With this musical white yea, I call that Madonna
And I can’t hear what niggas say, you know I’m high anyway
I’m funny with money
Could be your friend and yo enemy
I hate being broke, that’s a joke don’t pretend to me
Everybody can hit this blunt, I'm sorry I'm finicky
