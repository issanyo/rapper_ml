[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Hallelujah, my plug just send me 50, I got first right a refusal
My bitches my main shooter, I might make my bitch go do you
Don't bring your bitch around my chick
My bitch might jimmy choo her
Its Guwop, I ain't hip hop, but I bet my diamonds bluer
Got 3 spots, I got 2 drops and I ain't no nigga cooler
Got 3 rings, I got 10 chains and I think I'm Rick the Ruler
I got Young niggas in my straight 8, cause that's how I maneuver, Gucci!
Make trap back, I had a flash back, when I shot at that intruder
In a section, full of bad bitches, and they wanna smoke hooters
Way I beat the block, way I work the track
Make you think I'm a producer
Inside your head, medusa, you're dumb head, you need a tutor

[Hook]
I might not buy a new Mercedes, but I'ma drive your ass crazy
That's something she just done phase me
The way she suck it, so amazing
I'm bout to drive a bitch crazy
That's something she just done phase me
I'm bout to make a bitch pay me, pay me
You taking care of nigga baby
I'm bout to drive a bitch crazy

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame ]
Wave flag, no black car, flat back car, of 2 bars with 3 broads
40 grands on my g stars, pink slips don't lease ours
Who the fuck you think we are, retard!
Kick start this brick squad, that candy touch your body part
Trapped up like toll cars, goons have it real like the drug lords

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Got young shooters and dope guards
My A&R are dope boys, like a drug czar in a cold war
Pistol whip a nigga with a crowbar
Security guards they trelling you, so we pulling up and shooting both cars
Bag a nigga like a bag boy, paint a nigga like Mozart
Say he lived his life as a KING PIN, that's why they find his ass in the junkyard
Murder shit I know boy, I ain't really scared of no boy
Couple of home boys and lil joy, and they all waiting to come home boy
Got bricks all in my fender, bricks all in my floorboard
And you know a nigga paid a low for it but respect me, I can't go for it
All my hoes will fly for it, all my niggas will die for it
I can tell a killer when I see one, you can say Gucci got an eye for it

[Hook]
I might not buy a new Mercedes, but I'ma drive your ass crazy
That's something she just done phase me
The way she suck it, so amazing
I'm bout to drive a bitch crazy
That's something she just done phase me
I'm bout to make a bitch pay me, pay me
You taking care of nigga baby
I'm bout to drive a bitch crazy
