[Intro]
Drumma Boy
Look, look, uh

[Chrous]
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back

[Verse]
Man, like last night I O.D
Every day is like KOD
Same shit tonight
Champagne on me
Man, what the hell is wrong with me?
A nigga too fly to be in the club
Bad bitches scheming
But I'm never gon' pay to fuck, right
Just look at all these fake ass superficials
Probation over, I'm registering two pistols
You niggas make me sick
Blowing like a fuckin' whistle
I'm tired of glorifying niggas I ain't fuckin with
Real dough, I'm 'bout it
My hands right and my circle small
Nigga, back up, I feel proud
I'm still spending money from that first Chris Brown
And I'm smoking, feeling clouded
I'm elevating my flight mileage
Frustrated, we made it
Fuck you, nigga, I'm gon' stay wildin'

[Chrous]
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I keep on walking
'Cause love is like a mile away
Hear people talking
But I don't listen to shit they say
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
I'm smoking this blunt
I don't give a fuck if the devil is holding me back
