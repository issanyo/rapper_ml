[Verse 1: 8-ball]
I been up I been down I been in I been out
I was loved I was hated bitch niggas tried to cross me out
Nigga I been on I been off I been a worker I been a boss
Out of all the shit I ever been I never been soft
I been broke I been rich and a nigga ain't never been no snitch
Ima bad black nigga but I never had a problem getn no bitch but
I been stranded I been alone had my kids before I was grown
Shot that pistol that made them say yall niggas keep that dumb shit away from my dome
I been cheated and I been robbed
Niggas don't give a fuck who u are
Niggas don't give a fuck bout your standards
Niggas don't give a fuck if u a star
You got all the latest guns u got 80 niggas with u
But if niggas wanna hit ya best believe they'll get cha

[Hook][4x]
Life goes on
Goes on
And on
And on

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I seen it all some boys wall then fall down and crawl
When they knockin down them all next they tryn to sell it all
These streets are wild just one call can have you locked down by dem laws
One niggas snitch make up some shit conspirises hide behide them walls
Game so foul not just crack a nigga out here tryn to sell ya rap
Feel like I back up in that trap I'm in that studio tryn to stack my stacks
Radio only play shit that's whack
They ain't tryn to hear niggas spit these facts
So I guess I never get me no plex
But shit I quit before a nigga to do that
Man I'm a hustler I don't need rap
To move out the hood and live this good
I'll sell anything that a nigga buyn boys better get that understood
Was born broke up in the hood but I refuse to move back
Life goes on just stay strong 'Pac tell me that

[Hook][4x]

[Verse 3: MJG]
Some of our mothers and fathers are gone
Our sisters and brothers are gone
Our babies and children are gone
But life goes on
And so u gotta be strong because hard times
Do not discriminate they only intimidate bully and illuminate people without any faith
And if it wasn't for the pitfalls in my life I would of never ever learned how to climb out
Some things you can't be told or taught some things you just gotta find out
Some people go from millions to nothing
Some people go from nothing to mills
But what both them got in common neither one of them is happy still
You can bring a preacher back to steal or whatever your tactis is
So many people out here so fake they need to take a break and practice real
Pimp tight mjg tryin to live life and do a little good
I played my part but I didn't ride the bull

[Hook][4x]
