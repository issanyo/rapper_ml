[Intro: Drumma Boy]
Southern Smoke
I go by the name Drumma Boy
You better light this thang up nigga
A.k.a. D-boy Fresh
Eastside Jody, Southern Smoke, "stay-high-shit" nigga
Ayyyeee Booyyyy!
Ooooh shit!

[Hook: Drumma Boy]
Nothing but Ethanol, nothing but hot flame, flame
Ki-kill a nigga with this heat, call it insane, insane
Nothing but crack here, nothing but straight bang, bang
Got this shit on fire, now watch me make it rain, hah!
This that southern smoke, smoke

[Verse 1: Drumma Boy]
Now DJ make it bang, turn it up in here
About to show you how we flex, hustlers off the year
Drumma Squad Camp Get It - DSCGI
Be like a M47, bitch I'm born to fly
Roll up and bang your whole click, dri-dri-drive by
Got your bitch exchanging numbers when I slide by
Blow your pussy like a speaker call it no good
Bang that pussy nice, bang that pussy good
If this a bang contest, then announce me winner
Bang with my gang from summer to the winter
Just like the 80's baby, drop it straight crack
Bitch I'm a 80's baby, real niggas back

[Hook: Drumma Boy]
Nothing but Ethanol, nothing but hot flame, flame
Ki-kill a nigga with this heat, call it insane, insane
Nothing but crack here, nothing but straight bang, bang

[Verse 2: Alley Boy]
Ooooh!
Nigga this that southern smoke
Right before that gun smoke
Hollow tips [?] pray them niggas who selling dough
Greedy niggas gotta have it
With the automatic clip long
I'm a own man made, made my own lane
Nigga watch the throne
Duct tape 500 strongs, you can talk shit but it won't be long
The feds watching, nigga fuck a phone, shots to your dome
Alley Boy game lord, all my niggas they repping [?]
All my niggas in Memphis and Temple, Florida they going hard
Alley Boy and Drumma Boy, it's fuck your mama boy
Broomsticks in your ass, better use a rubber boy
Nigga I'm that southern flame, leave never southern smoke
Duct Tape the Mob and Drum Squad we at your throat

[Hook: Drumma Boy]

[Verse 3: Eastside Jody]
This-this that southern smoke
I'm cooking up that southern dough
If selling drugs is a religon, I'm the southern pope
Nothing but weed and coke, for me that's how the money comes
A lot of niggas with me, and we got a lot of guns
This ain't no game, this ain't no joke, we down to die about it
You say you really live that life, be down to die about it
They say you gotta sacrifice, but that dont go for us
Because we gon start shooting at you if you fuck with us
(BA BA BA BA BA!)
Kush-Kush-Kush come from California but I'm southern smoking
My wrist hurt from counting money, I need a Ibuprofen
I get big money, but I fucks with DJ Smallz
Fish scale shawty, in the hood they call me Jones

[Hook: Drumma Boy]
Nothing but Ethanol, nothing but hot flame, flame
Ki-kill a nigga with this heat, call it insane, insane
Nothing but crack here, nothing but straight bang, bang
Got this shit on fire, now watch me make it rain, hah!
This that southern smoke, smoke
This-this that southern smoke, smoke, ayyee boyy!
This that southern smoke
Now watch me make it rain, ayyee!
This that southern smoke, smoke
