[Hook: Gucci (x3)]
I’m infatuated intrigued
In need of weed, my need for speed got me buying Lamborghini's
My taste in fashion got my body covered in G’s
My taste in trappin' got me sellin' kilos and P's

[Verse 1]
I’m in Miami with a wife beater feeling the breeze
A wife beater but I'm unmarried lookin' for skeeze
You say you classy and sadity, I say bitch you a tease
And ain't no teasing Gucci Mane I need a girl thats freaky
I drink my rosé out the bottle ain't no glasses for me
I give my girl a glass of champagne she say thank you Gucci
I take her to the Gucci shop and she say thank you daddy
I tell her baby girl you welcome but it’s really nothin'

[Hook]
I think she want me and I’m feeling the same way
But shawty bring your A game
When you see a player rollin', money can’t be folded
I’m pretty sure you know what it is girl
And You know,  you know,  you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
And You know,  you know,  you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
(Thats my world, Thats my girl  and you know and you know)
You know what it is Girl

[Verse 2: Gucci]
You know I know I’m your uno
You think I'm the shit girl
40 thousand dollar pilot, First class flight to Pittsburg
The way I direct shit man they think that I’m Steven Spielberg
200 thousand dollar car so you know what it is girl
Put a bowtie on a Bentley flying Spur and chauffeur
The best time of her life she ever had I had to show her
She Wanna got down low down the floor
But I am no golfer
Fuckin' all these nurses
But no I am not a doctor

[Hook]
I think she want me and I’m feeling the same way
But shawty bring your A game
When you see a player rollin', money can’t be folded
I’m pretty sure you know what it is girl
And You know,  you know,  you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
And You know,  you know,  you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
(Thats my world, Thats my girl and you know and you know)
You know what it is Girl

[Verse 3: Young Joc]
Candy coated birth 2 inches off the ground
Let your girl sing a song lemme lick you up and down
The first time I seen it I was leaning
Off the lean diamonds gleaming start to thinking (lil mama you got me fiending)
Her pinky ring is looking like a bedrock
Said she wanna take some pictures
First lets take some head shots
And now she got her legs cocked
I’m beating up the juice box (mo mo money make me cum)
Well Joc gon' make you cum non-stop
I wanna fuck her with the lights on all night long, to one of my songs
Let her keep my ice on, knock it up like tyson
Hit her with this python, clap on clap off get ya on my  iPhone

[Hook]
I think she want me and I’m feeling the same way
But shawty bring your A game
When you see a player rollin', money can’t be folded
I’m pretty sure you know what it is girl
And You know,  you know,  you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
And You know,  you know,  you know what It is Is Girl
You Know What It Is Girl
(Thats my world, Thats my girl and you know and you know)
You know what it is Girl
