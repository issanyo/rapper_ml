[Intro]
Somebody give me a lighter
Yeah, uh-huh

[Hook]
I'm in the hot tub smokin' with my feet up
Cut off them fake niggas and told 'em I don't need 'em
I bow my head and say a prayer before I re-up
I got 5 ounces of drank in my one liter
Play with fire and get your ass burnt like Ether
Pass me that fire so I can light this reefer
In the coupe at the red light smokin' like it's legal
In the coupe at the red light smokin' like it's legal

[Verse 1]
I'm in somethin' fast doin' donuts in this bitch
My bitches bad and you know I like 'em thick
I just came to drop some swag then I dip
I'm still smokin' out the bag, that's how I live
My last name shoulda been Banks like Uncle Phil
My pinky ring match the watch, the watch match my ears
I'm pourin' up Promethazine on the Leer
All that ass over there? Tell 'em I'ma come here
Alexander McQueen, the girl got a big blunt kush behind my ear
I can't relate to the fake, most of these niggas snakes
I'm only smokin' on gelatto because I love how it tastes
100 thou around my neck so that .40 on my waist

[Hook]
I'm in the hot tub smokin' with my feet up
Cut off them fake niggas and told 'em I don't need 'em
I bow my head and say a prayer before I re-up
I got 5 ounces of drank in my one liter
Play with fire and get your ass burnt like Ether
Pass me that fire so I can light this reefer
In the coupe at the red light smokin' like it's legal
In the coupe at the red light smokin' like it's legal

[Verse 2]
Roll it up and light it, did all that while I'm drivin'
To these bitches I'm a dog, in the trap I'm a savage
Bought another foreign and took it to go get matted
Just met her yesterday and she callin' me baby daddy
I'm on Codeine, she drinkin' raw
I just went and bought another charm
And another watch for my other arm
I got pussy niggas out here prayin' for my downfall
All this ice on me got me shinin' like Armorall
Hall of famer in the trap, got my plaque on the wall
Everybody with you a pussy, I don't fuck with none of y'all
I just spent 1000 dollars on designer draws
I don't stop for the police, nigga fuck the laws
Nigga fuck the law

[Hook]
I'm in the hot tub smokin' with my feet up
Cut off them fake niggas and told 'em I don't need 'em
I bow my head and say a prayer before I re-up
I got 5 ounces of drank in my one liter
Play with fire and get your ass burnt like Ether
Pass me that fire so I can light this reefer
In the coupe at the red light smokin' like it's legal
In the coupe at the red light smokin' like it's legal
