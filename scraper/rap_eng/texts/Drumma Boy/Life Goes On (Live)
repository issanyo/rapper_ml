[Chorus: Gas]
Life goes on (8Ball, MJG)
Life goes on (8Ball, MJG)
You gotta keep movin', you gotta keep grindin'
Life goes on
Life goes on (Uh, yeah)
Life goes

[Verse 1: 8Ball]
Now I been up, I been down, I been in, I been out
I was loved, I was hated, bitch niggas tried to cross me out
Nigga, I been on, I been off, I been a worker, I been a boss
Out of all the shit I ever been, I never been soft
I been broke, I been rich, but a nigga ain't never been no snitch
I'm a fat black nigga but I never had a problem gettin' no bitch
But I been stranded, I been alone, had my kids before I was grown
Shot that pistol that made them young niggas keep that dumb shit away from my door
I been cheated and I been robbed
Niggas don't give a fuck who you are
Niggas don't give a fuck about your status
Niggas don't give a fuck you a star
You got all the latest guns, eighty niggas with you
But if niggas wanna hit you, best believe they can hit you

[Chorus: Gas]
Life goes on (No matter what happens, you gotta keep livin')
Life goes on (You gotta keep movin', you gotta keep grindin')
Life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes

[Verse 2: MJG]
Some of our mothers and fathers are gone
Our sisters and brothers are gone
Our babies and children are gone
But life goes on
And so you gotta be strong
Because hard times do not discriminate, they only intimidate
Bully and eliminate people without any faith
And if it wasn't for the pitfalls in my life
I never ever would've learned how to climb out
Some things you can't be told or taught
Some things you just gotta find out
Some people go from millions to nothing
Some people go from nothing to mills
But what both them got in common, neither one of them is happy still
You can be a preacher or back to steal
Or whatever your tactics is
So many people out here so fake
They need to take a break and practice real
Pimp tight MJ, I'm tryna live life and I'm tryna live good
I played my part but I didn't write the book

[Chorus: Gas]
Life goes on (No matter what happens, you gotta keep livin')
Life goes on (You gotta keep movin', you gotta keep grindin')
Life goes on (Hey)
Life goes on (Hey)
Life goes on (No matter what happens, you gotta keep livin')
Life goes on (You gotta keep movin', you gotta keep grindin')
Life goes on (Swear it does, it does)
Life goes on
