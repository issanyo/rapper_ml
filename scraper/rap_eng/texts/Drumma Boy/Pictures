[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo

[Hook]
Tryna make a mil a day I know you get the picture
Nigga stay up out the club the Feds taking pictures
Don’t pull out your cell phone I don’t want no picture
Nigga dead and gone wish we woulda took some pictures
Tryna make a mil a day I know you get the picture
Nigga stay up out the club the Feds taking pictures
Don’t pull out your cell phone I don’t want no picture
My nigga got life wish we woulda took some pictures

[Verse 1]
Hundred thousand on my wrist just for the excitement
The Feds played the game dirty with them secret indictments
Used to love that bitch for real but that hoe she was trifling
In the hills with the check but you know I ain’t hiking
Rest in peace my boy Mark I swear that was my nigga
Just wish before that he got killed we coulda took more pictures
Gotta stop going out cause folks be all in my face
I be thinking it’s the Feds tryna build them a case
Oh I be thinking it’s too wild just tryna see you I’m slipping
Don’t wanna talk or take a picture shit I know I ain’t tripping
I could leave the game to day shit I got money for days
But every time the pack touch I be stuck in my ways

[Hook]
Tryna make a mil a day I know you get the picture
Nigga stay up out the club the Feds taking pictures
Don’t pull out your cell phone I don’t want no picture
Nigga dead and gone wish we woulda took some pictures
Tryna make a mil a day I know you get the picture
Nigga stay up out the club the Feds taking pictures
Don’t pull out your cell phone I don’t want no picture
My nigga got life wish we woulda took some pictures

[Verse 2]
Back and forth out west on the private jet
Monet touch down so you know what’s next
A bitch with me took her shopping on Rodeo
The next day we was right back in the air though
My nigga gotten out he said them folks asking shit
Where the fuck the lawyer at we don’t answer shit
In Miami making call from the fucking boat
A few mil a week I got the club on the ropes
I just want a better number ain’t no hard feelings
Gotta feed my fucking fam my niggas got children
Sending millions at a time try to paint that picture
Some homies turnt to hoe niggas but I can’t be bitter

[Hook]
Tryna make a mil a day I know you get the picture
Nigga stay up out the club the Feds taking pictures
Don’t pull out your cell phone I don’t want no picture
Nigga dead and gone wish we woulda took some pictures
Tryna make a mil a day I know you get the picture
Nigga stay up out the club the Feds taking pictures
Don’t pull out your cell phone I don’t want no picture
My nigga got life wish we woulda took some pictures

[Outro]
I gotta take pictures, I gotta
