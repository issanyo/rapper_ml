[Hook]
They ask me where I've been, I tell 'em chasing long money
Got 4 houses but I'm never at home money
[?] blow nothing but strong money
My whole life I've been plotting on this long money

[Verse 1]
I got sand out the streets, got my budget out the trap
Swear these boring ass rappers make me wanna take a nap
Fell asleep thinkin' 'bout money, took a million dollar nap
Bumped into my old bitch, said she'd pay me just to take her back
Bitch please, hell nah you can't have my contacts
[?] my weed up, gave the whole hole city contacts
Ballin' extra hard, you think I signed a sports contract
Only bought two pair of sneakers, but they cost me 1 stacks
How can you not notice me, sour apple [?]
Matter of fact the same colour that I'm smoking
[?] big bag college girl who I'm smoking with
You rappers my desert, so it's over with
[?]
All I know is [?]
Not a fan of candy, so I don't kick it with [?]
Motivate the young niggas to get the grown money
Say I'm brown like my weed, keep chasing that long money

[Hook]
They ask me where I've been, I tell 'em chasing long money
Got 4 houses but I'm never at home money
[?] blow nothing but strong money
My whole life I've been plotting on this long money

[Verse 2]
No I dont get along with rappers
Flossing crack babies

Dont get this shit twised, im all about that cheesecake
My bread, my quap, my
They label me a big dog cause i get big bread
And my daddy too
Jump out here, nothing left to do
Two brothers, and two sisters
18 with
Randall
Pull up in a black coupe, I call it black panther
Bithces love him but niggas can't stand him
Money, it doesnt matter
