[Intro:]
Yea, Quavo, Quavo
Alexia Ayaana, Alexis Ayaana
Migo & Drummer, Migos & Drummer
Aye


[Verse 1: Alexis Ayaana]
You now right up in your head
But you did never matched what you said
Givin' me the same excuse
And for that I replace you

[Hook:]
In fact, I blame your damn mama
For raisin' me of all these damn problems
We fucked up because we lucked up
We fucked up because you didn't want love
One more time, ain't no us nah
I don't it bad enough, nough, nough
Nough, nough, nough
I don't want you bad enough, nough nough
I don't want it, I don't want it

[Verse 2: Quavo]
She already know what time it is
If you lookin' for love you can't find it here
I really don't know how to feel
If I tell her go, yeah she will
Run around
With them big thighs
Brown eyes, aye
We can go out
When I pop out
My ties on me
Cause I like a fancy bitch
I like the fastest whip
I think I keep it too 100
Just to be standing right here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Alexis Ayanna]
It's too late, fuck you thought this was
Thinkin' you can come back anytime you want
Cause all this good he be kissin on it
[?]
But you didn't want to do what a man had to and think about you
Do me a favor lose my whole number
Shit, It's okay cause that's my old number
I tried it all, I give my all
But you didn't want to do what a man had to and think about you

[Hook until faded]
