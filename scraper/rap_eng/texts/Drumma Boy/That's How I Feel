[Intro: Young Dolph]
It's Dolph
It's Gucci
It's Dolph

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Own a big house and it's full of bad bitches
I'm just sayin', can a young nigga live? (Let a nigga live)
2 million worth of cars parked in the front yard
But want another Rolls Royce, that's how I feel
For 100 shots, I heard you paid a 100 stacks
Hope you got your receipt, go and get your hunnid back
For the new coupe, I paid 400 flat
Smash your baby mama, woah, then I sent her back, hey
Sittin' in the truck, smokin' on a blunt
Then I realized, I think I hear somebody shootin'
(Hey, what's that?)
You think I'm goin' out like Pac and Biggie, you must be stupid
The millions keep callin' my phone and I'm headed straight to it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Shippin' money by the mail, I just came back with the bills
Now I'm dancin' in the trap, that's how I feel
I'm in a coupe, cost half a mill, I just redid my Chevelle
Got 2 Maybachs in both, that's just how I feel
I got 2 bitches at the ‘tel, hope that they don't kiss and tell
I'm way too much for just one bitch, that's just how I feel
You know that salt can kill a snail but can do nothin' to a player
I'm way too trill, I'm hard to kill, that's how I feel

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Only Gucci, twin Ks, I just made the front page
Please stay out my lane, mane 'cause I got road rage
Fresh up out the cage, I'm the jack of all trades
And you suckers can't kill me, I'ma die of old age
Put your hands on Gucci, then I'm jumpin' off stage
Choppa'll turn a nigga dreads to a high top fade
Call me drop top Wop, I'm in a hard top Wraith
'Bout to roll the window down and start throwin' out grenades
Nigga, this is how you feel when you walk up out the jail
And walk up in that bank and tell 'em give ya 20 mill'
And this is how she feel when you do her hair and nails
And dick so good, she can't keep it to herself

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Shippin' money by the mail, I just came back with the bills
Now I'm dancin' in the trap, that's how I feel
I'm in a coupe, cost half a mill, I just redid my Chevelle
Got 2 Maybachs in both, that's just how I feel
I got 2 bitches at the ‘tel, hope that they don't kiss and tell
I'm way too much for just one bitch, that's just how I feel
You know that salt can kill a snail but can do nothin' to a player
I'm way too trill, I'm hard to kill, that's how I feel
