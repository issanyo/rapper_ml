(Verse 1)
Ball on dat baby if dat bitch a keeper, damn they slept on ya boy hit em wit da sleeper, had to thank the Lord this morning i ain't meet the reaper, still kick it wit my dogs like we playing fifa, made out the struggle I’m so hot now u might catch a fever, i ain't really wanna ball if it wasn’t wit my people, i been on my hustle since a younging used to trap a beeper, young pot wit dat sauce smoking on dat reefa, if i never made a name for my self, would u still leave shit on my window, would u still creep up in my dm, would u still claim to know my kinfolk, held my shit down on my 10 toes, 93 gas for my benzo, overnight baby went from nah I’m straight lil bruh to i’ll be yo nympho

(Hook)
Im not gone give up, I’m not gone pipe down, now she want pick up, she want me pipe down, where was u tho, wen i needed you tho, tryna get gas for my lil two door, where was u tho, wen i needed u tho, ain't believe in me now they give me kudos

(Verse 2)
I be looking for positive energy, but lately you been feeling like enemy, why u even come around if u ain't feeling me, like u mad if i ain't on yo itinerary, i been in a zone so i gotta keep my pen wit me, i forgive but that shit be in my memory, meditate cuz i gotta keep my zen wit me, tryna cut it out my life if it hinder me, lil bitch told me i wasn’t poppin that offended me, told her baby all my life i can’t penny pinch, late night sessions sipping on that henny henn, right back at that bitch like the minute man, if i never made a name for my self, would u still leave shit on my window, would u still creep up in my dm, would u still claim to know my kinfolk

(Hook)
Im not gone give up, I’m not gone pipe down, now she want pick up, she want me pipe down, where was u tho, wen i needed you tho, tryna get gas for my lil two door, where was u tho, wen i needed u tho, ain't believe in me now they give me kudos
