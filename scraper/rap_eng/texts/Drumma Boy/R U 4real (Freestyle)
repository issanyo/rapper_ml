[Verse:]
Lately, I can't seem to get my mind off you boy
(wondering where you are, wishing for your call)
Thinking, all the slick 'ish I'm gon' say when you call
To make you want it more
(i know you want me now, but you gon' want me more)
Cuz I be acting like I'm not
When I'm really feeling you
You can just relax your mind
Cause there's so many things I wanna do to you, do to you
Cause I
I just wanna make sure you're sure, boy
(are u sure)
That You
You can handle all that I got in store, got in store

[Chorus:]
Are you for real
Can you handle
Are you for real
Can you handle
All this love that I got
Can you handle
If you can't, let me know now
Can you handle me

[Post-Chorus:]
I just wanna know that, when we get together, we 'gon have a real good time
I just need to know that, when we get together, you 'gon really take ya time
Cuz some talk about it, Really I'm about it, If you tryna take me Down
I just wanna know that, when we get together, you can handle all of mine

[Chorus:]
