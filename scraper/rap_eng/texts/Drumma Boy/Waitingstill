I picture you in your red dress
Looking so perfect
Everyone's asking you
"Where is your boyfriend?"

And then you explain them some
We're off on a plane
Or in some other city
Leaving wondering how he's so lucky

I would give you all I have but my time
Even though, girl, every second passing
You're on my mind

As the only thing I know for sure
Is where I was the day before
But I promise that this much is true

I do it for you, I do it for us
I do it so one day we can turn this love
Into a house and a home
Where you won't ever have to be alone
And I promise you I'll make it, I will
I hope you're waiting still

I picture you on a park bench
Reading your favorite
Book and they looking
Asking you if you're took and you say

"Yes, absolutely
In love madly, truly"
But I know if I was by your side
They wouldn't even try

And I'll give you all I have but my time
Even though with every second passing
You're on my mind

'Cause the only thing I know for sure
Is where I was the day before
But I promise that this much is true

I do it for you, I do it for us
I do it so one day we can turn this love
Into a house and a home
Where you won't ever have to be alone
And I promise you I'll make it, I will
I hope you're waiting still

I hope when I get back from where I'm going
You are still the one that I'm coming home to
'Cause if you walk out that door, I'll be to blame
It's true but

I do it for you, I do it for us
I do it so one day we can turn this love
Into a house and a home
Where you won't ever have to be alone
And I promise you I'll make it, I will
I hope you're waiting still

I hope you're waiting still
I hope you're waiting still
