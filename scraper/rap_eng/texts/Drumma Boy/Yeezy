[Verse 1]
I picked lil' momma up and put some weed in the air
Now I'm smashin' from the back and pull her weave out her hairr
I had her on the bed from the couch to the trap
Then I had to tell her 'bye, bitch I got dope to go sell'
Bitches love me but they know I'm a player
Every day I take chances and say my prayers
I never had a advance check over here
These rocks on me, nigga ice water clear
She too thick I told lil' momma to come over here
She so thick she make a thong disappear
I put karats on my wrist, naked ears
The way she suck it I said 'girl, you can't be serious'
She the best at it, she a sex addict
MAC-11's, AK's and TEC's in the addict
I got bad habits that's what got me livin' lavish
So I can't complain uh bitch you know my name

[Hook]
All she wanna do is ride with a nigga
Pour my drank up and get high with nigga
She say she gon' ride or die with a nigga
I put ice on her and let her shine with a nigga
I pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new bitch
I pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new bitch
I pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new bitch
I pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new bitch

[Verse 2]
Pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new boo
Dues, dues in the club in my Gucci boot
Gettin' a back massage while I'm eatin' fruit
I just had a menage with my favourite two
I pull these rappers cards for fun, that's what I do
I'm in a mansion with my son playin' peek-a-boo
Boy you don't take care of your kids so how I real is you
But you out here payin' these hoes, boy you pitiful
My old bitch jealous on my new thang
I just did a show and went bought a new chain
I just threw your advance up at Blue Flame
She a bitch but she lonely cause you too lame

[Hook]
All she wanna do is ride with a nigga
Pour my drank up and get high with nigga
She say she gon' ride or die with a nigga
I put ice on her and let her shine with a nigga
I pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new bitch
I pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new bitch
I pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new bitch
I pulled up on my old hoe flexin' with my new bitch
