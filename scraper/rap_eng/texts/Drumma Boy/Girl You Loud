[Intro: Tyga]
Yeah, niggas won't ride for you, niggas won't die for you
Bitch I'll ride for you, niggas won't die for you
Fuckin' in the mornin', makin' love, fuckin' in the mornin'
Wakin' up, fuckin' in the mornin', niggas won't ride for you

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm 'bout to get up on that ass right now
Just love me, love me down, now
And you a smoker, I'mma roll up, you blow it down
One more, oh, oh, girl you loud
I'm 'bout to get up on that ass right now
Just love me, love me down, now
And you a smoker, I'mma roll up, you blow it down
One more, oh, oh, girl you loud

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Yeah, I put that diamond in you, boo
Put on your favorite birthday suit
I hit them lights, we in the mood
I'mma slide inside and don't you move
Scorpio, sex drive for two
Who else you know would die for you?
Them niggas ain't livin' that shit
I showed you shit them niggas won't ever do
This year I do my thing
'Bout to put that Def to shame
So high, eyes low
How you scream my name, the only time you use in vain
But I swear this time no foreplay and games
Shoot it straight to your naval ring
Put it back in, go again
Lookin' at this mess we made, but I can't take the blame

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Oh, babe, yeah, this your bed, you lay in it
No, I'ma lick it up, girl you gon' play with it
Oh, babe, taste so good, I put my face in it
Now she runnin' from the dick, I told her stay with it

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm 'bout to get up on that ass right now
Just love me, love me down, now
And you a smoker, I'mma roll up, you blow it down
One more, oh, oh, girl you loud
I'm 'bout to get up on that ass right now
Just love me, love me down, now
And you a smoker, I'mma roll up, you blow it down
One more, oh, oh, girl you loud

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah you are, steppin' on my heart
You're so cold right now and you tryna lay me down
But I'm not scared of death, girl, if I die, my love ain't gon' change
Cause we in deep, hold your breath, girl, baby I'm in so deep, and you just wanna be loud all night, girl

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Oh, babe, yeah, this your bed, you lay in it
No, I'ma lick it up, girl you gon' play with it
Oh, babe, taste so good, I put my face in it
Now she runnin' from the dick, I told her stay with it

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm 'bout to get up on that ass right now
Just love me, love me down, now
And you a smoker, I'mma roll up, you blow it down
One more, oh, oh, girl you loud
I'm 'bout to get up on that ass right now
Just love me, love me down, now
And you a smoker, I'mma roll up, you blow it down
One more, oh, oh, girl you loud
