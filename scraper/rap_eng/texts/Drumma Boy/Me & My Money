Me and money go together
Loved her since I first met her
If you touch her I get jealous
She do just what I tell her
Me and money go together
Loved her since I first met her
If you touch her I get jealous
She do just what I tell her

Now the suckas on the side
Lookin' mighty jealous
I'm ridin' wit the fellas
Only 22inch propellers
It ain't nothin' you can tell us
Your girl tryna get near it
You talk a lot, I can't hear it
She's curious and I'm serious
Drop by in a drop benz
So get money til' the world ends
So still face I won't been
So get a ring and call the fellas
'cause me and money go together
We go anywhere the money let us
I love her like my favorite sweater
Me and money got a sick bun
I'm out these sick stones
Got me all these bad hoes
Got me out on six bunz

Me and money go together
Loved her since I first met her
If you touch her I get jealous
She do just what I tell her
Me and money go together
Loved her since I first met her (loved her since I first met her)
If you touch her I get jealous (if you touch her I get jealous)
She do just what I tell her

Started this shit out on holy matrimony
If we break up she gon' charge me alimony
And if they find out our hideout spot in the country
I'ma have to move her to another country
And it no secret, they know I'm gettin' money
Boy take beef for me an' you know I'm gettin' money
I came ready to play like superbowl sunday
Laughin' all the way to the bank like I shit funny
I play the cards I was dealt like in gin rummy
But its trumped so you know I gotta go for doubles
Me and money tell the truth we make a good couple
Break her wit my girlfriend then I'm in trouble

Me and money go together
Loved her since I first met her
If you touch her I get jealous
She do just what I tell her
Me and money go together
Loved her since I first met her
If you touch her I get jealous
She do just what I tell her

She my girlfriend so we sleep together
Got a hundred grand in my fuckin' pillow
And if I have a problem than I go and get her
But tell the truth you know I'm right here rhymin' wit her
She stay wit me sunny or rainy weather
She really help a nigga get his life together
My money, I hope you'll be my wife forever
Make a hater sick, he'll have to take an alka-seltzer
Baby we gon' tie the knot like a fuckin' pretzel
Make a hundred mil' and tell them they can have the extra
Take a picture wit my girl, don't we look successful
I keep that bitch wit me so my life is never stressful

Me and money go together
Loved her since I first met her
If you touch her I get jealous
She do just what I tell her
Me and money go together
Loved her since I first met her
If you touch her I get jealous
She do just what I tell her
