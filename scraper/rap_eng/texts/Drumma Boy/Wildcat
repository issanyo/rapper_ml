[Verse 1]
An ounce of love is all I need to fly with an angel
While the dealers die for it
The kush burn like bullets, both 'em chasing the green
I'm chiefing, seeing
Dime after dime, girl, I need that strong shit
That top of the line, you know that sticky icky wrong shit
You know that there might be a time, pretty young thing
Baby, just try this, I got all the flavours, got you fiening

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, girl, I got you warming up so take off your clothes
And we can do it anywhere, have one cup, let’s go
Hallucinating this hit will make you see a ghost
You’re mine, it’s alright
You said that you ain't smoke in a while, baby
So we gon' fuck and I'ma roll up
It’s getting loud, blowing on that loud, girl
Baby, I'ma work you out, girl, work you out, girl, I love you, Mary Jane

[Chorus]
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
Let me light that shit on fire, Mary Jane I'm fucking with ya
I'ma hot box in your hot box, you just take it like a picture
I'ma go slower and slower, so high you flying, baby
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
I'ma break you down, l-l-lick you like, lick you like
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
I'ma break you down, baby, so high we’re flying, yeah

[Verse 2]
You so high, you flying, baby
Smoke that shit, better give me a light, my private jet red eye, baby
Give it to you good, beat it up, yo pussy is a crybaby
Don’t stop, take it to the head, yeah, yeah
And I'm puttin' in work, that 9 to 5, baby, comin' round, you smokin' brown
Let me bust that, switch you out, baby, that white girl, them white papers
Let’s roll up, roll up, I'm off that green, she off that molly
I need a bottle of water and everythin' good, the kitty cat smilin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, girl, I got you warming up so take off your clothes
And we can do it anywhere, have one cup, let’s go
Hallucinating this hit will make you see a ghost
You’re mine, it’s alright
You said that you ain't smoke in a while, baby
So we gon' fuck and I'ma roll up
It’s getting loud, blowing on that loud girl
Baby, I'ma work you out girl, work you out girl, I love you, Mary Jane

[Chorus]
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
Let me light that shit on fire, Mary Jane I'm fucking with ya
I'ma hot box in your hot box, you just take it like a picture
I'ma go slower and slower, so high you flying, baby
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
I'ma break you down, l-l-lick you like, lick you like
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
I'ma break you down, baby, so high we’re flying, yeah

[Verse 3]
Okay, hol' up I'm 'bout to roll up
I got a pint, gon' mix it with the Sprite, let me pour up
Hell of a night, 100 million dollar yacht
Never paid for the pussy but after this you gon' owe us
Sick on the dick but don’t throw up
Break it down, bend you over
OHB, I'm off the THC
I guarantee that bitch nigga won’t show up
I'ma make the bitch bounce, bounce
Nigga to yo look style, we gon' pull up at Snoop house
Smoke it by the ounce ,ounce, a nigga be too high
Now you star struck, kinda fucked
I'ma go HAM when I'm in it
I throw 100 bands when I'm winnin'
What you sayin'? It’s a limit?
She on my shoulder, gettin' closer, now she a chain smoker

[Chorus]
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
Let me light that shit on fire, Mary Jane I'm fucking with ya
I'ma hot box in your hot box, you just take it like a picture
I'ma go slower and slower, so high you flying, baby
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
I'ma break you down, l-l-lick you like, lick you like
I'ma break you down, baby, lick you like a swisher
I'ma break you down, baby, so high we’re flying, yeah
