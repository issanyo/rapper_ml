[Intro]
Yeah, uh, it's nothing

[Chorus 1: R0th]
Stacking cheese till my bread right (cheese)
Smoking weed till my head right (weed)
Did it all on my own so (cash) I'ma spend all my bread like (cash)
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's box gang and it's something, it's something
But it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing
Stacking cheese till my bread right (cheese)
Smoking trees till my head right (weed)
Did it all on my own so (cash) I'ma spend all my bread like (cash)
It's nothing, it's nothing x4

[Verse: R0th]
Out here working in the sunlight
And we living that box life
Photosynthesis, I be smoking that plant right?
Questionaire, I don't care what you think, just stop and stare
My girl wearing nothing but socks, that is what you call a fucking pair
Hakuna matata, me and you I wanna
I stuck it up in her na na
And I buss back like ta da
Anything I do I gotta look good (good)
Not making a mistake saying I shoulda, woulda, could
It's rothrock minus the rock, you wish that's where you stood (You wish you were up here)
Yeah lets get the party started, up all night (my god)
Drink in my left, plane in my right
Super medicated, on my lap be my wife, uh

[Chorus 2: R0th]
Building it from the ground up
Gin up all up in my cup
Did it all on my own so I'ma party all night like
It's nothing, it's nothing x4
Uh, building it from the ground up (working)
Gin up all up in my cup (gin)
Did it all on my own so I'ma party all night like (cash)
It's nothing, it's nothing x4
