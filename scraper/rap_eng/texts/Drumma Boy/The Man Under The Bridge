[Verse 1]
I never was the smartest, couldn't rhyme fast
Couldn't shoot hoop, barely ever went to class
Started writin' rhymes goin' through the studio
Beggin' club on the knees, please let me do a show
This ain't like over night I got my big break
Shook up South rap like a China earthquake
Top of the world, ridin' with the top down
Thank God I ain't got to sell or rob now
Look around, every kid is in the street playin'
Still innocent and never touch the devil hand
I see the old man walkin' like his feet hurt
Pushin' a shoppin' cart with everything he owns in it
That's somebody's dad, that's some mama's son
A whiskey bottle, the only place he call home
I stop and talk to him, shoot him a couple warm
Sherry cold beer and ask him where he come from

[Hook]
But I can't explain this
Wish I couldn't change this life
I don't know why
A man look complacent
But all our days are wasting by
I don't know why

[Verse 2]
He looks so tired, I feel bad for him
He from the mile, shit, I wonder did my dad know him?
He said he got a son and a daughter my age
But he ain't seen either one in decades
He said he went to college and played football
He got two degrees and practiced law
He had a big house, a beautiful wife
Two kids, the perfect American life
Then one day his wife got sick
Cancer in the breast and it progressed quick
A year went by but his wife didn't make it
Two young kids, now alone and gotta raise them
And you could still see the pain in his eyes
Eyes that can't lie, eyes that don't cry
I asked him what happened after that bro?
He said he lost his job and he just gave up, shit

[Hook]
But I can't explain this
Wish I couldn't change this life
I don't know why
A man look complacent
But all our days are wasting by
I don't know why

[Verse 3]
We just sat there quiet for a minute
Thinkin' bout his shoes and if I was in 'em
He says young man don't ever judge me
Don't feel sorry for me because of what you see
I chose this road, the pressure got to me
My family tried to help but I wasn't ready
Liquor seemed to be the only thing
I could do to take away the pain
My kids walk around in shame
I know, this some hard shit to explain
Tell their friends when they ask
Why you never talk about your mom and your dad?
Then it got quiet, he just sat there
Stood up, he took a sip from his beer
He didn't say nothin' and he walked away
And I still see him every day

[Hook]
But I can't explain this
Wish I couldn't change this life
I don't know why
A man look complacent
But all our days are wasting by
I don't know why
