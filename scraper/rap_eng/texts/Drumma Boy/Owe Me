[Intro]
(Drumma Boy)

[Chorus]
I been all around the world, every girl want a street nigga (aw, yeah)
100 bottles in the club, that's me nigga
Ya bitch looking at me, nigga, I'm 'bout to leave with her (aw, yeah)
Soon as I lit the blunt she said, "Can I smoke with ya?"
I said, "This shit ain't free"
She said, "I know all I need is one pull" (aw, yeah)
"I came to smoke with ya"
I said, "Okay babe, only this once, you know you owe me"
"Can I smoke with ya?"

[Verse]
You owe me, 'cause I pulled up in that Ghost (yeah)
The 'raris behind me, behind that the Lambos (yeah)
I'm sorry if you feel I'm doing the most (yeah)
You came here to get wifed up, I came here to get hoes (yeah)
I just want to buy bottles
And you came here to find love
That'll never work 'cause all she want is
All she want to do is get fucked good

[Chorus]
I been all around the world, every girl want a street nigga (aw, yeah)
100 bottles in the club, that's me nigga
Ya bitch looking at me, nigga, I'm 'bout to leave with her (aw, yeah)
Soon as I lit the blunt she said, "Can I smoke with ya?"
I said, "This shit ain't free"
She said, "I know all I need is one pull" (aw, yeah)
"I came to smoke with ya"
I said, "Okay babe, only this once, you know you owe me"
"Can I smoke with ya?"
