[Intro]
Yeah, I told y'all
OMG, Oh My Goodness
Ain't fucking around
Come on!

[Verse 1: OMG]
Bitch, what's my name
O-M to the
A.K.A, bad ass nigga
Young California
Don't just hit switches
SLR, I fly past niggas
No pot on the stove
OMG, I'm hot and I'm cold
I ain't gotta put you in a box with the chrome
I kill you with the music, you like [?]
I gotta go
I told Dough
That I'd meet him at the top of the throne
Catch me with this bitch in these retro 4's
With a bad bitch, you couldn't make it on your own
I'm so cold, and I'm sorry mama
But I can't say I'm gonna change
I'm gonna stay
Repping the niggas that's on the end of my chain
Shout out [?] L.A
Lenchmob [?] be the gang
Heir to Californ-I-A
West side until I'm in my grave
No drinking, no smoke, for [?]
[?] Cigars, and champagne
Cause my team be winning games
Throwing stacks, that's a parade
Fuck bitches, and fuck po-lice
So much, I should say it twice
Don't need a nigga read me my rights
I'm too busy living my life
Yeah, this my life, this the life
With two chicks, I'm getting [?]
And you know if they came through
Then they staying overnight
But not tonight, I got a flight
From Vegas after the fight
Better be wi-fi on my flight
Cause my hoes be loving Skype
OMG, I'm in this bitch
Kicking it here with my big bro
All these hoes be Shannon Brown
Jumping all over Monica
Fuck with us, nigga might fuck around end up layed out in chalk
Paralyzed niggas can't do that walk
All you niggas do is talk
And if I offend you supposed thugs
Excuse my Kanye West, Michael Jordan shrug
And that's word to Percy Miller
Young ice, like water to these thirsty ass bitches, no hands

[Outro: OMG]
No hands, no hands
Tell that bitch to suck my dick
With no hands, no hands, no hands
