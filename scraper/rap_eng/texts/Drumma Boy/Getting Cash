[Hook x2]
I fuck bitches, I bust guns
I sip lean, I smoked out my lungs
But getting cash is what I do best (I do best)
But getting cash is what I do best (I do best)

[Verse 1 : Project Pat]
I fuck 'em nigga bitches, I fuck 'em nigga hoes
I sip a lot of lean, I like to blow dough
I hit the strip club and I’mma make it rain
I bet you all these stripper bitches in here know my name
Fuck off a lot of cash but I get a lot of cash
Cash cash cash, boy I get a lot of ass
I got a lot of haters but I got mo' guns
Rubber bands full of hundreds, nigga no ones
Two bitches one on me, a lot of cash : I’m a boss
One chick can suck my dick, the other girl can have my balls
I’m out here counting money to my thug Kurt Blue
Tryin' to rob, hat trick the nine and hit, atchoo !

[Verse 2 : Juicy J]
Okay I'm smoking on dope, still getting paid
4 time grind, can’t miss a day
Ball like I play for the NBA
I’m rich as a bitch and I feel it’s great
Name so hot, wrist so cold
Pretty lil ho tryna fix her nose
Sippin on lean, yo bitch a blow
Up in the club you the bitch I'm swoled
Yea I’m bout that trippy life
Bitch to the back, I’mma hit it twice
Come into the house and I’m shoppin'
Yeah white girl let’s take a flight
Gorilla pimp bitch, I eat that steak of shrimp
It’s so damn hot, nigga I live in the blimp
Cigarillo keep buddyin' me
My left my nay, keep muddin' me
Spend a few with my bad bitches
What can I say, I just love women
Kush pipe from the west coast
Brought a chick from the east coast
Stoned out in my beach house, get head on my speed boat
