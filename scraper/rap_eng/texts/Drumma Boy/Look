[Jody Breeze]
Well what up for yah, it's your boy Breeze again
Breezin' in with one of yall breeze again
And I know Jesus seein' me sin so why not blow dro, why not sip see and gin
Reason bein' since birth man things have seemed
A little different, I'm still pimpin' deep with in
But now that I'm grown it's on so I'm a go on and spit it
And if I wanted your ho I could have her gone in minutes
I pull up in the chevy looking' real suficient
With a bottle of Hennessey and a blunt of that sticky
Hops out with the forces the same color of the fitted
Instead of callin' me daddy these hoes callin' me diddy
I got a bundle of bitches with a lot of ass and titties
Nigga young and old, freak nasty with it
Gold teeth gonna shine, so nuff
And you can turn your head but your broad gonna look

[Hook]

[Big Gee]
Hoppin'out of candy coated chevy bitch (look)
Whole team ballin' harder than a ruckus trick (look)
Sucka tryin' to get live, got his gut split (look)
Got some type of piece tucked in my briefs slick (look)
That's why we rollin' deep and ready with a beef taker (look)
A dime piece with me all you better do is (look)
Get your head open wide like a pocket book (look)
You know you shook you ain't gotta hide your face bitch
Yeah its mister click clacker yeah I jack the jackers
Cover more than greyhound every hustling' backwards
Stay in the pocket getting' sticked but I'm breakin' them tackles
Disrespect shift you brain left to right like a tackle
I've been getting' it in for years and real niggas know that
Back when Dominique, Brooklyn jersey wasn't the throw back
Take it from me, I'm a hunt your ass down like a lojack
Catch your ass while you sleep, blow your ass like a dro sack

[Hook]

[Young Jeezy]
Step up in the club with just a swing in my chain
It's deez boyz snow man is the name
Posted up poppin' cris like you do them beers
Got bread stashed I ain't seen in a couple of years
When I ball I see a gangsta they don't look they stare
Symbols in my ears 6 figures a pair
And I'm straight from the hood that's where I come from
Still spend a hundred grand a year on white air ones

[Hook]
