(Verse 1)
Pops got it on him heavy head wears the crown, stuff two fat cones as i take a shot of crown, writing rap lyrics down like i got the gift gab, started out wit an ounce made it bounce ask slab, in my cherokee, we was struggling living middle class, wen u realize ain't no line u just heard that shit in class, be the predator, on these wicked streets dont sleep, niggas waiting for yo spot drip game no leak nigga 100 miles an hour I’m running, i took that onion flip that shit into some money, i learned valuable lesson wen ya hustling, never let the business bleed into the personal, its grind mode, friends turn they back most of the time wen u broke, thank God for the real niggas now in my cirque, told drumma 2017 nigga we gone murk, broke my heart had to put my nigga bank on a shirt

(Hook)
No love and its February x 4

(Verse 2)
Cupid was stupid, pulling up in the hood, niggas got no heart, niggas dont use smarts, niggas always wear fisad, cops tryna find the killer, even television got a bad future for a nigga, fruit dont fall far from the tree, picture dis kanye run for president next and he sweep trump, gone for bout 3 months baby I’m home, just greet me good wit some food and some dynamite dome, a blind fold on my eyes they want, til can’t see, we controlled so much we dont know who to be, and they hiring for a puppet boy u fit the description, didn't read your contract guess u didn't pay it no attention, gave slick more than half to yo staff boy, one miss gone be sitting on yo ass boy, we glorify the grind so much a nigga have a chance but he rather slang slabs on dat ave boy…
