I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stunting on the hoes and I'm shitting on the cowards
I'm up 24 hours I'm 24 hours I'm up 24 hours
No shit shave or shower
Until I get my money back
I gotta get my money up
I'm up 24 hours

Cut it up some Cori

[Verse 1]
Damn its a good day. Damn its a good day
Call Drumma Boy and told him lets go make a hood tape
First thang Ima do pull out my 7'4
Candy coated black things sittin on them Forgios
24 towers, 8 bricks of powder, 10 bales of dro
That's what I paid for
Don't talk about my Lambo talk about my Rarri
Talk about my Phantom, talk about my Harley
Brick Squad Biker boy, angel named Charlie
Dudes going psycho white boy gnarly
Every 24 seconds passin me the marley
Lames tryna diss dont effect me hardly

First signed Waka, then I signed Gucci
Then I sign Brick Squad tell em come sue me
