[Verse 1: Project Pat]
See I don't fuck wit 'em, with them fuck niggas
Might just cut the beak off of a duck nigga
Heard he was talkin down, well wassup wit'cha?
Man he gone off that brown, must be tough liquor
Now I done popped me a molly, now I'm life of the party
Niggas hate from a distance, but in my face they be silent
Keep that shit to a minimum, don't want to catch me a body
Keep a blunt on my lips, keep my fire right beside me
My clique rollin behind me, never thinkin bout switchin
A whole clique of young niggas, they'll send them killas to get'cha
In my hood like a transmission, don't think that I'm slippin
Keep some throw-away pistols, them trigger fingers be itchin

[Hook: Project Pat]
You's a fuck boy, and I don't fuck wit'cha
Talkin fuck shit, you better duck bitch
I'm talkin trigger fingers, my whole squad itchin
You see a real nigga, ain't no mirage bitch
You's a fuck boy, and I don't fuck wit'cha
Talkin fuck shit, you better duck bitch
I'm talkin trigger fingers, my whole squad itchin
You see a real nigga, ain't no mirage bitch

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
See I'm a real dude, and I don't fuck wit'chu bitch niggas
Run they mouth just like some hoes, must be the bitch in 'em
Bitch niggas be the main ones turn to snitch niggas
Switch up on ya like some muhfucka with some switch in 'em
But it don't matter, I just stick to the script
Keep it G with my dogs, keep that fire on my hip
Fuck niggas, be ready to catch a real nigga slip
Keep my Gucci shoes laced, you'll catch a whole clip
Put some racks on his head to make a fuck nigga dip
I'll take my tax off that bread and blow it all in a fit
Your bitch done opened them legs but all I want is her lips
And all I do is get money to make a fuck nigga sick

[Hook: Project Pat]
You's a fuck boy, and I don't fuck wit'cha
Talkin fuck shit, you better duck bitch
I'm talkin trigger fingers, my whole squad itchin
You see a real nigga, ain't no mirage bitch
You's a fuck boy, and I don't fuck wit'cha
Talkin fuck shit, you better duck bitch
I'm talkin trigger fingers, my whole squad itchin
You see a real nigga, ain't no mirage bitch
