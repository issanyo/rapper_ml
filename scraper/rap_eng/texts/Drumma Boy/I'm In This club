[Verse 1: Project Pat]
I ain't playing bout that paper, Serious bout that betty
I want that Rarri like mob life, Frank Nitty
Disrespect, turn your brains into baked ziti
Young nigga, out the window holding that case steady
We in the club, V.I.P keep them bottles coming'
I got that trap dick she fiend for, keep her coming

Louie Vs, all designer, check my shoes ho
I got that fish scale swag, that's some good blow
I like my money coming fast, but that head slow
We on the mollies and that kush, let a nigga know
We'll split yo shit, stomp yo punk ass to the floor
Shut this motherfucker down, give em a real show

[Chorus: Project Pat]
My money long long long, Wells Fargo
Plenty whips, big garage that's where my cars go
I hustle hard, moving fast like a Lambo
I bought my whole squad choppers, bitch I'm Rambo

I'm in this club, I'm high as fuck
Ain't never a motherfucker gonna fuck with me (x3)
I'm in this club, I'm high as fuck
Ain't never a motherfucker gonna fuck with me  (x3)

[Verse 2: Nasty Mane]
We popping bottles in the club, huh (Mafia!)
Smoking green passing mollies to them hoes, huh (Mafia!)
We on that Ace, we need bout 20 more
Them sparklers on them bottles look like a firework show (Mafia!)
We in this bitch, we with yo bitch
You a police trying to handcuff her
Say i beat the pussy like she stole something
That's a metaphor for I fucked her
You mad tho, she glad tho
She say I'm the shit, no toilet bowl
I got plenty paper like a toilet roll
I got more bitches than a dog pound
So I play the field for a touchdown
Pull the dress up, and them panties down
Tell her bounce it back like a rebound
Act the fool when we fool around
That's cold blooded, my heart flooded
With ice water and i don't give a fuck
That pistol on me like a missile homie
And i'll shoot that bitch if you niggas jump

[Chorus]
