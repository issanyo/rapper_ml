(Listen to this track bitch!)

[Hook]
Told my bitch quit shopping she ain't listen
Foreign, foreign, foreign roof went missing
Balmains wrapped with the Benjamins
They was sleeping on me now the feeling him
Told my bitch quit shopping she ain't listen
Foreign, foreign, foreign roof went missing
Balmains wrapped with the Benjamins
They was sleeping on me now the feeling him

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
Dabbin' in Givenchy with no ceiling
Balmain wrapped, I got Benji's
Bet she gon' fuck for a follow
Instagram flex like a model
Yo bitch a freak and gon' swallow
They plug, like Pedro and Pablo
Foreign, foreign, foreign, swervin', sippin'
Left the club with two ho's now they strippin'
Shoppin', shoppin', shoppin', bitch you boppin'
As soon as I walk in the panties droppin'
I'm dabbin' with the chopper, boy don't do it
You kissing her, she sucking me, you stupid
I gotta flex with a knot, I made a mill with one pot
We got the straight drop, finessin' the gas, I get rid of rerock

[Hook]
Told my bitch quit shopping she ain't listen
Foreign, foreign, foreign roof went missing
Balmains wrapped with the Benjamins
They was sleeping on me now the feeling him
Told my bitch quit shopping she ain't listen
Foreign, foreign, foreign roof went missing
Balmains wrapped with the Benjamins
They was sleeping on me now the feeling him

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
FLIPPA!
They was sleepin' on the dab now they feelin' it
Bring a bad bitch over here start drilling it (Smash!)
See I might pull up to Lenox and valet the Fisker drop bands on my ladies
I been thinking 'bout them M&M's lately, how many bands can you get for a baby? (Flippa!)
She got a shoppin' problem, and I got a dabbin' problem
The mansion it came with commas, we set a new trend and we start from the bottom
Never slippin', dab is always drippin', and my roof is missin', and the [?] missin'
Cartier clear frames, bitch I got good vision, pocket rocket in the club wearin' [?]
Bathing ape, Maybach drake
My youngins eat OG Flippa cut the cake
I do not discriminate I hit every race, addicted to lean fell in love with the taste
I spend a whole 20 then pull out some more, I used to kick doors out a Honda accord
Hit a missionary til' she gets sore, and when we count condos we count the whole floor
FLIPPA, FLIPPIN'--

[Hook]
Told my bitch quit shopping she ain't listen
Foreign, foreign, foreign roof went missing
Balmains wrapped with the Benjamins
They was sleeping on me now the feeling him
Told my bitch quit shopping she ain't listen
Foreign, foreign, foreign roof went missing
Balmains wrapped with the Benjamins
They was sleeping on me now the feeling him
