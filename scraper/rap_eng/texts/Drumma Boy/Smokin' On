[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Cut those cameras on cause my camos on
And my niggas back and we riding 'round town
With a big ol' bag of weed, Taylor Gang, we ain't in yo faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg done created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and I'm making this cash
And we 'bout it 'bout it like Master P
Go hard, stacking cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
T-G-O-D, he's the O-G, real G shit what it has to be
My real niggas gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas won't get bags from me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I'm riding 'round town in a car that you can't even pronounce
And you can't go fast as me
Smoking marijuana and she know that I'm a player
So she wanna come up here and spend that cash with me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is whack to me
My kush grown organically
My balling is actually

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though
Cause if it's in my joint, believe that it's the best smoke
I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though, fa sho
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Let me turn you on and turn you out
To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got:
Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don't know
This is that shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock - oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don't speak at all
You might 'scape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight: let me break it down for you
Flip it, zip it, let it fly
If it's good, it's gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain't the one
We don't even smoke that shit for fun!

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Let you get high but I ain't smoking with the rest though

I'm talking OG kush from the West Coast

You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on
You might get smoke but you ain't smoking what we smoking on

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Yea nigga, I'm rolling up that high-grade
Chilling on the porch, smoking like it's Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J's a high day
Niggas think I'm Chinese cause my eyes straight
I pour up a 6 into a 20 ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like 20 ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I'm high as fuck
Every chick I'm seeing Juicy screamin out: 'let's fuck!"
I done popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher
