[Intro]
OHB, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Modified my living, yeah
Did it all for what, just to keep you with me, yeah
And everytime I tryna say some, you don't believe me
Girl, you so damn cold, I've been down this road before

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in it, never again, ask, on my city
Never again
How am I supposed to trust you when your love is inconsistent?
But you've been going on and on 'bout commitment

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, commitment
God is my witness, commitment
Commitment, commitment

[Verse 2]
Yeah, so tired waiting, yeah
I need more patience, yeah
I'm sick of running around
I need somebody around
Grocery shopping, I brought
Baby, you got to get it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Never again, ask, on my city
Never again
How am I supposed to trust you, when your love's inconsistent?
But you've been going on and on 'bout commitment

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, commitment (commitment)
God is my witness, commitment (oh, commitment)
Commitment, commitment (hey, hey, ow)

[Verse 3]
Living is living
Cheating is cheating
Winning is winning
You want me committed
But married to me like a federal sentence
I'ma handle my business, 'cause you make a difference
Don't see other bitches
You can't compare living
To finish each others sentences
And we got to go
Just looking back at all this shit that you did for me
I'm 'bout to buy this bitch a Rollie
Matter a answer then I believe one for the week
We never beef, she always lie to police
That bitch a rider for me
And then when I put designer on her feet
I'ma cuff it, but I'm not the police
Commitment

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, commitment
God is my witness, commitment
Commitment, commitment
