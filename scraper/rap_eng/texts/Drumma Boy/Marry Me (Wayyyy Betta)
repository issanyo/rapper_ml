When my bank account full I feel wayyyy betta, she said its me or the money... I just wave at her... I'm on one bended knee money will u marry me? I'm on one bended knee, money will u marry me? 

I propose I propose I propose I propose, rolls Royce bitch I roll, got my pockets super Swoll, got a nugget on my pinky I ain't talkin bout chicken, Money flowing in, everything clicking, prolly get a new house, new car, new check, send me my deposit I ain't worried bout a blue check, run ins wit the law thank God I was too blessed, I Kno wat I'm doing, I don't need ya two cents, catch me in the back rolling Louisville sluggers got gold every where cup filled wit a two step, pull up to the club like let me park my coupe here, let that cream float to the top like root beer...
