Slim Dunkin, Flocka, Gucci, Rocko

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm Windex Shawty, I'm cleaning the glass window
My niggas smoking indo, these suckas smoking pretendo
I used to like Keri Hilson, but she don't like me
I tried to wife up Kelly Rowland, but she declined me
I fucked Fantasia once and it was splashy
Lil Kim tried to stalk me, sexually harass me
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, my diamonds match my Chucks
So if you wanna buck, then tell them knuckle up
I'm sorry, I got preference for Ferraris, darling
Don't solve me like [?], I'm not an Atari
Too late to say sorry and [?]
I'm in that black and red slut with that cranberry guts
I'm fresh as fuck

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Slim Dunkin]
Leaving out the Rarri lot
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
I'm walking out of Walters, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Leaving out the jewelry store
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Me and my bitch, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, pistol on tuck
Oh shit, too late to swing, y'all niggas better duck
Little mama acting, say, "I couldn't fuck yesterday"
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I bet she gon' say yes today
Niggas keep on testing me just 'cause they ain't fresh as me
Tell them boys don't mess with me, I'll crunch him like a Nestle
Mr. Postman, body parts in your mailbox
Nigga, try Gucc, 12 gauge to your dreadlocks
Stole Gucc's Ferrari just to match the fit
Stove Flock's 6 just to smash your bitch, Dunk
I ain't done, nigga, don't try to run, nigga
Why I call you Junior? 'Cause you my son, nigga

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Slim Dunkin]
Leaving out the Rarri lot
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
I'm walking out of Walters, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Leaving out the jewelry store
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Me and my bitch, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck

[Verse 3: Rocko]
X-ray me, homie, ain't no phony bone on me, homie
Get money shit in me, it ain't on me, homie
Short a couple bucks? It's cool, I'll hook you up
Rocko a real dude, that's why the hood show him love
Fall up in the booty club, might throw a dub
That's why all the shaky booty girls showing love
Lysol fresh, diamonds clear as Windex
Throw the cash, put the bottles on the Amex (that black card, nigga)
Charge it to the fame
I ain't know that was your main thing, charge her to the game
One time for the money, two times for the goons
Three times for [?], got me way fresher than you

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Slim Dunkin]
Leaving out the Rarri lot
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
I'm walking out of Walters, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Leaving out the jewelry store
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Me and my bitch, nigga
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
Bitch, I'm fresh as fuck, I say, bitch, I'm fresh as fuck
