[Intro]
Drumma Boy
On that freaky shit tonight
Can we do it for hours (Oh girl)
Said me follow you right, to the bedroom
We gon do that freaky shit you like
Once more, one more, I know you ready for that freaky
I think you ready for that freaky

[Verse 1]
They might have to separate us
Girl you sweating off your make-up
Damn I know the neighbours hate us
When we start making love

[Chorus]
Cause we on that freaky shit tonight
Can we do it for hours? Oh girl
Said me follow you right to the bedroom
We gon' do that freaky shit you like
Once more, one more, I know you ready for that freaky
I think you ready for that freaky

[Verse 2]
Girl it's a couple hours later
Baby I got you paralyzed from the waist up
Off that loud and we on, on, on our way up
You wanna see me just work it out, put it up, right there oh
Can't nobody come between us, it's the best I ever had
Go up and down and round round, I wanna see you throw it back
Baby let me be your saviour when you're drowning in the sheets right now
Don't give a fuck 'bout what they say

[Chorus]
Cause we on that freaky shit tonight
Can we do it for hours? Oh girl
Said me follow you right to the bedroom
We gon' do that freaky shit you like
Once more, one more, I know you ready for that freaky
I think you ready for that freaky
Cause we on that freaky shit tonight
Can we do it for hours? Oh girl
Said me follow you right to the bedroom
We gon' do that freaky shit you like
Once more, one more, I know you ready for that freaky
I think you ready for that freaky

[Outro]
Tonight can we do it for hours?
To the bedroom, we gon' do that freaky shit tonight
Once more, one more
To the bedroom, we gon' do that freaky shit tonight
