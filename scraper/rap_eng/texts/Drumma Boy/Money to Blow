[Intro: Birdman & Drake]
Richer than the richest
More money, bitches
Yeah, coming to you live from the city of Houstatlantavegas
So what it do young nigga? One hundred

[Verse 1: Drake]
I am on a 24-hour champagne diet
Spilling while I'm sipping, I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it, boy, I'm on that fly shit
I am what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what? I made it!
I'm the motherfuckin' man, I just want you to see
Come take a look, get a load of this nigga
Quit fronting on me, don't come around
And try and gas me up, I like running on E
I, I-I-I'm on my Disney shit - Goofy flow
On records I'm Captain Hook, and my new car is "Rufio"
Damn, where my roof just go?
I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shakin' somethin' cause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leaving girls that love me, and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts, I said "Damn, where my roof just go?"
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl

[Hook: Drake]
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but bitch, I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow

[Verse 2: Birdman]
(Cash Money millionaires)
Yeah, richer than the richest, we certified getting it
CM, YM, Cash Money business
Higher than the ceiling, fly like a bird
Hit the Gucci store and later get served
We smoked out, with no roof on it
Them people passing, so we smash on 'em
Ballin' out, we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghinis and them Bentleys on the V-set
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds
Cartier, Ferrari, the new Spider
No lie, I'm higher than I ever been
Born rich, born Uptown, born to win
Fully loaded, automatic 6 Benz
Candy paint, foreign lights with my bitch in
Born hustling, too big nigga to size me up
Kept stuntin', more money, burnin' up

[Hook]
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but bitch, I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Well I get paid every 24 hours
Money and the power
Come to V.I.P. and get a champagne shower
I don't have to worry because everything ours
And I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers
That kush
I promise that's my dude
But we don't smoke that Reggie Bush
And I'm with two women
Make you take a second look
We popping like champagne bottles
But we never shook
And we gon' be alright if we put Drake on every hook

[Hook]
They can't help it and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, but bitch, I got money to blow
I'm getting it in
Letting these bills fall all over your skin
I got money to blow, oh, I got money to blow
