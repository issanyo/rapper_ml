[Intro: Trey Songz]
Baby, are you lovin'?
Let me love, let me love you girl
Baby, are you lovin’?
Oh, oh Drumma Boy

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
Are you lovin' the way?
Baby are you lovin' the way?
It ain’t no thing
Are you lovin' the way?
Baby are you lovin' the way?
It ain't no thing
Oh baby, are you lovin' the way? (baby)
Let me know baby, it ain't no thing babe
Are you lovin' the way?
Baby are you lovin' the way?
It ain’t no thing
Are you lovin’ the way?
Baby are you lovin' the way?
It ain’t no thing
Oh baby, are you lovin' the way? (baby)
Let me know baby, it ain't no thing babe

[Verse 1: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
You're looking so damn good
And I won’t let it go to waste
I ain't trying to waste your time
There ain't no time for games
Girl, I know you're ready
I'ma eat your mind if you're ready
I don't wanna be just more than a friend
So many wishes, we should start with a kiss baby
Foreplay, could wait another minute
'til I get my hands on, you babe
Wait another second, my hands all over your body
You like a drug and I can't get enough of it
I'm addicted to your booty girl, yeah
Oh, too many questions need answers
Oh, tell me if I messed up
And I don't know what to say to you
So right now, I hold your love for ransom
Oh, girl you're just too much to handle
Oh, and all I really need to know from you is -
So tell me oh

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Chris Brown]
Are you lovin' the way? (Baby, are you lovin'?)
Baby are you lovin' the way? (no, no oh)
It ain't no thing
Are you lovin' the way?
Baby are you lovin' the way?
It ain't no thing
Oh baby, are you lovin' the way? (baby, baby)
Let me know baby, ain't a thing babe (no, no,no)
Oh, are you lovin' the way? (baby are you lovin')
Baby are you lovin' the way? (oh)
It ain't no thing (it ain't no thing)
Are you lovin' the way?
Baby are you lovin' the way?
It ain't no thing
Are you lovin' the way? (Baby, are you lovin'?)
Baby are you lovin' the way?
It ain't no thing
Are you lovin' the way?
Baby are you lovin' the way?
It ain't no thing
Oh baby, are you lovin' the way? (yeah,baby)
Let me know baby, ain't a thing babe (no)
So tell me oh
Are you lovin' the way?
Baby are you lovin' the way?
