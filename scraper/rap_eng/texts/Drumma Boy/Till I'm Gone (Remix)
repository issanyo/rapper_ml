Feat. Wiz Khalifa, Pusha T & Jim Jones

[Chorus Wiz Khalifa:]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day
Remix
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)

[Verse 1 Tinie Tempah:]
Can't see me bitch, I'm something you will never know
I'm a star you need a muthafucking telescope
Doing numbers, punching in the telephones
I give em line after line like I'm selling coke
I'm well connected like a nigga with a modem
And these bitches know I ball that's why these bitches on my scrotum
Flying right across the ocean bumping Frank and Billy Ocean
On a private jet, they let a nigga smoke, think I'm joking
Come and play, pour out another bottle
Bring your girls round and let's turn my apartment to a brothel
I do this shit for real, blowing up the clubs
And when they see the bottles then them bitches know it's us, muthafuckers

[Chorus Wiz Khalifa:]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone
But I won't be gone for too long

[Verse 2 Pusha T:]
Yeah, you see I'm back like I never left
The haters stay, see they never left
I'm selling doup over treble clef
Wrist looking like a treasure chest
Hella pads and hella jets
We fly, back seats we drive
Hotels attire, next stop Dubai
Tell home "bye bye"
We getting at this money at the moment
Drop SLS is just a bonus
Push with Tinie Tempah, better watch ya temper
The holder of that gun, got a heart like December
So roll with the winners or move out the way of the storm
Cause I'm coming for all crowns till the day that I'm gone
Never gone

[Chorus Wiz Khalifa:]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

[Verse 3 Jim Jones:]
Spent summers, Harlem world, spent summers in Miami
Atlanta stripper girls got my gun up in the Grammys
And I be buying time, just like my automo
You catch us flying by inside the foreign cars
My sneakers from uptown, my diamonds from the district
You wanna be uptown, you know I got the biscuit
So crack another bottle, light another blunt
Mommy looking good, see that ass from the front
She going to the back, but that's not the trunk
She had some Louie luggage, put your bags up in the front
You catch us in the kitchen, and we be cooking powder
These niggas ain't freshen if you put 'em in the shower

[Chorus Wiz Khalifa:]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day
