[Verse 1]
Keep it so good and for bread and butter never played a game
Niggers be acting, this unattractive pussy look so lame
Niggers are starving so robbing just went up a hundred percent
The cops slippin' somebody less fortunate gon' take that shit
Snatch it and pack it and sell it for cheap, nigga that's straight profit
Nigga that's bills paid, nigga that's cash in them pockets
Blame it on Bush, George1 and George2
For all the bullshit there is, brother goin' through
Bill ass niggers gonna stay the real
Fuck ass niggers gon' fade with
Hoe ass niggers gonna die of bitches
I'm strapped motherfucker don't play with me
I'm turned up about my check
Still gettin' money in my old project
Got two's on deck
This bringin' up the sack
I'da made a me like that
I was talkin' 'bout trap, strap, kickin' my back
Jumpin' on the floor with the strap
Got cameras in the front, back, tool in my lap
In this bitch cookin' up crack
And you see what I drive, I'm high, fly
Ain't shit a nigga can't buy
And it's me and my guys, I ride guy
I get to a bitch right now
Young nigga be Popeye, I ain't gonna lie
I can see a bitch in your eyes
So I keep that vibe damn right
I'm a go hard damn all the time
I'm out here chasin' bread and butter
I faced a lot of strugglers
Just show this bitch I'm from the gutter
Watch me turn up on these suckers
Turn up

[Hook]
I know some gutter boys
I know some gutter girls
And they all live in the gutter world
I know some gutter boys
I know some gutter girls
And they all live in the gutter world
For their bread and butter
They go gut a gutter
For their bread and butter
They go gut a gutter
For their bread and butter
They go gut a gutter
For their bread and butter
They go gut a gutter

[Verse 2]
Gutter niggers don't clamp in the shoots
Before you wanna plan this heat you better know how the gang goes
I see you servin' them packs
And I hear you got the cracks
Mother fuck you got to hold them blocks all
But look at me, I gotta eat
I'm tryin' to get up on my feet
I wanna work 'em on this bitch with the bank roll
I'm a have to let you down, I'm a put that on the pound
Don't frown cause you know how the gang go
For the breand and butter, you gotta get your brother
Cause he won't understand if I come into hand
I gotta feed him and his mother
So let me cut around with all that floss
Nigga I got me a lunch time
Better play low key my nigga, these boys goin' forward in my lunch line
If a nigga's gonna eat, you gotta get murk
Then it's what it's gonna be
Got a couple niggers on your tinuend true night that I set it up
Force my feet, got a few gutter holes running these streets
Panning that out, playing that beat
If you don't pound around nigga none of them weak
Playing with their money, watch your ass get beat in them streets

[Hook]
I know some gutter boys
I know some gutter girls
And they all live in the gutter world
I know some gutter boys

[Verse 3]
Born in the gutter
Raised in the gutter
Guess you could say I'm a gutter motherfucker
Don't play it brown with you motherfucker suckers
No love for a sneeze, no love for a buster
Hustle, nigga, all I know
Hit the bricks, nigga, get that dough
Don't play no game, I pimp a hoe
Miff a Tennessee nigga with a country flow
This cup and this blunt got me smoke
That bread and butter got me on go
Cause a nigga from the gutter don't mean that a nigga can't go and get that case whole
That bread and butter
That shit make me gut a gutter
That bread and butter
That shit make me gut a gutter
I swear the bread and butter just keep callin' me
Keep it comin' out hard like ballin' G
Pimp the lyrics of a pimp, that's a part of me
So ruthless, these streets coldhearted me
Livin' stunt half all the way to Crystal Street
East Side till the nigga rest in peace
See that money make a nigga do crazy thangs
Wanna hang your bang for the chains of fame
Who's that with that fat man drinkin' that cognac?
Ready for combat bitches
TMack don't need no hothead woman
Your ball better take care of order
I'm in the city with killers and thugs who don't give a damn about sellin' no drugs
Memphis inside of me
Real niggers ride with me cause in the heart of the city's no love
Yea hoe, I'm from Memphis
That owed me cause you know what that's like?
Yea hoe, that shit is cutthroat
No love hoe, we shoot on sight (yea hoe)
Pick that bitch you fuckin' with
She suck my homie dick Sally
She needed a rent paid week
Fuck about that's all we hall it
I'm sayin' no
Ain't no love in the city when it comes to a weak motherfucker
Tryin' to act hard in the street
Then we look him in his eyes
Take his money then we leave him in the gutter
I'm sayin' no
I'm watchin' the people observin' your every move
Bitch please make your next move be your best move bitch

[Hook]
I know some gutter boys
I know some gutter girls
And they all live in the gutter world

And they all live in the gutter world
