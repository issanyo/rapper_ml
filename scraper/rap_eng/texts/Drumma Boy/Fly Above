[Verse 1:]
I'm so comfortable in the skin I'm in, I'm secure about who I am, so you go ahead and talk all you wanna, I built up a shell and it's hard and it's armored. It seems like every step I take up, drama comes along with the bread I cake up. But you ain't doing nothin if you don't have haters, so I welcome you to do what's in your nature

[Hook:]
I'm like a jet airplane, way too high to hear you throwing salt on my name. I know I'm not the only one if people love to hate you go and throw your hands up go ahead and spread your wings cause you gotta fly above

[Chorus:]
I fly above all the drama, I I fly above, I I fly above, I I fly above, it's beneath me, it's beneath me, it's beneath me. So I fly above all the haters, I I fly above, I I fly above, I I fly above, it's beneath me, it's beneath me, it's beneath me

[Verse 2:]
If everybody hatin cause you fly-I-I, then gon throw yo hands in the sky-I-I, if people jealous cause you live yo li-I-ife, then gon throw yo hands in the sky-I-I, see I ain't even worried bout you and your insecurities, the only thing that matters is my family and G.O.D. I'm a shooting star but my feet still on the ground and when you flying high people wanna shoot you down

[Hook:]
I'm like a jet airplane, I'm way too high to hear you throwing salt on my name. I know I'm not the only one if people love to hate you go and throw your hands up go ahead and spread your wings cause you gotta fly above

[Chorus:]
I fly above all the drama, I I fly above, I I fly above, I I fly above, it's beneath me, it's beneath me, it's beneath me. So I fly above all the haters, I I fly above, I I fly above, I I fly above, it's beneath me, it's beneath me, it's beneath me

[Bridge:]
All you haters (haters), you're the wind beneath my wings (wind beneath my wings), you just make me fly higher (higher), higher (higher), higher, ooh you just make me fly higher, make me fly higher, make me fly higher

[Hook:]
I'm like a jet airplane, way too high to hear you throwing salt on my name. I know I'm not the only one if people love to hate you gon and throw your hands up go ahead and spread your wings cause you gotta fly above
[Chorus:]
I fly above all the drama, I I fly above, I I fly above, I I fly above, it's beneath me, it's beneath me, it's beneath me. So I fly above all the haters, I I fly above, I I fly above, I I fly above, it's beneath me, it's beneath me, it's beneath me
