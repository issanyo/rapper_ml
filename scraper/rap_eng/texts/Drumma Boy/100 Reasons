[Verse 1]
100 reasons why my check is up
Pistol play, the tech gon' fuck
Smoke you if it's medical
Niggas in they feelings tough
Beamer logo on the foreign
Whip it, push it, I be touring
Bitches treat me like the Lord
Cut them off, I keep a sword
Fuck 'em in the truck
Eat my pussy up like butter cup
Hundreds in the duffel
Micky D's, I do not beef with them
Stacking, packing, living lavish
Thirty clip, the semi automatic
Talking cabbage
Eat them bands up, I'm a rabbit
Hold up!
Your swag come on sale
Upping my prices, your profit it move like a snail
It was snakes up in my grass
Like Lucci bitch just wish me well
Hunt bands like a fishing sale
Pay to abort, get sent to hell
Diamonds on me water, I might catch the sickle cell

[Hook]
I got hundred reasons why I ain't sign no fucking deal
I got hundred reasons why these niggas bitches, they gon squeal
I got hundred reasons why these hoes can't hang, they don't appeal
I got hundred reasons why, I don't talk bitch I say bye
I got hundred reasons why I ain't sign no fucking deal
I got hundred reasons why these niggas bitches, they gon squeal
I got hundred reasons why these hoes can't hang, they don't appeal
I got hundred reasons why, I don't talk bitch I say bye

[Verse 2]
Hundred reasons you a rookie
You can't trust a eater-groupie
Drop the top, bitch like I'm Gucci
You too slow, your money losing
I just cashed out on some Louie
Ferragamo, I just choose it
Freaky nigga wanna do me
I'm too much to walk in movies
I'm never on no petty shit
Betty Boop, she doing dicks
Speak on me, have several seats
Remember brother hitting licks
Beggars been my go
Taking flights to rock my shows
I throw dollars at the hoes
Pay you bills and play your roll
Up next, Asian Doll that bitch
Drama Boy let's make a hit
Scratch that foreign off my list
Choker flooded out like piss
Running shit like this football
Stash that Coca in the wall
Titty boy, I never fall
Lay you down like you a log

[Hook]
I got hundred reasons why I ain't sign no fucking deal
I got hundred reasons why these niggas bitches, they gon squeal
I got hundred reasons why these hoes can't hang, they don't appeal
I got hundred reasons why, I don't talk bitch I say bye
I got hundred reasons why I ain't sign no fucking deal
I got hundred reasons why these niggas bitches, they gon squeal
I got hundred reasons why these hoes can't hang, they don't appeal
I got hundred reasons why, I don't talk bitch I say bye

[Bridge]
Aye! A hundred reasons
Fifty reasons, hundred reasons
Yeah, a hundred reasons, yeah, fifty reasons
I'ma rich bitch, skrrt, skrrt!
Asian Doll! yeah, aye!
Skkrt, fuck these niggas talking about?
Bands, yeah, a hundred reasons why I'ma rich bitch

[Hook]
I got hundred reasons why I ain't sign no fucking deal
I got hundred reasons why these niggas bitches, they gon squeal
I got hundred reasons why these hoes can't hang, they don't appeal
I got hundred reasons why, I don't talk bitch I say bye
I got hundred reasons why I ain't sign no fucking deal
I got hundred reasons why these niggas bitches, they gon squeal
