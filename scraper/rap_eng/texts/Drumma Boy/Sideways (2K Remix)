[Verse 1]
I'm the best, I don't have to practice
Double team, I don't have to pass it
Ballin hard in our chevolets
More vets than the dallas mavericks
Hall of famer, like shaq and magic
Kobe bryant i'll back to back it
Shoot the three if I have to nash it
Dwight howard when im at the basket
In the gym without the nastics
D wade ? got to flash it
Checking account got so many 0's
My name in the hood is Robert Parish
When it comes to the Js, I got the classics
Jason kidds and I got the patricks
Number 1 of all the draft picks
Championship, gots to have it
Been the starter since day 1
I'm with Kanye, I'm with Akon
I run with kings like Tyreke
'Cause I been a prince like Tayshaun
But I feel like LeBron everywhere I go
'Cause every time I score, you know

Them hater lookin at me sideways sideways sideways
Them hater lookin at me sideways sideways sideways
Them hater lookin at me sideways sideways sideways
Them hater lookin at me now sideways sideways sideways
CyHi!

[Verse 2]
Glenn Rob, big dog
Run through the zone like chris paul
Im somewhere, a mile high
Like carmelo when the knicks call
You d rose with the free throws
Fourth quarter and you choke
I done made every shot
You would think I had the cheat code
Memphis grizzlies, beast mode
Forty seven, kirilenko
When im hurt, im suited up
Never catch me in street clothes
Im on point like rondo
More blocks than Mutombo
Im working out in the mourning
My trainer name is alonzo
Sooo, I dont care who played
Cause when im done playing 2k...

[Hook]
