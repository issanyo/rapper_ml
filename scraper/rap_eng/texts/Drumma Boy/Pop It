[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm tryna find love
But usually I'm not that blind to see you lady
But I'm tryna get you out of this club
'Cause when we in the car, panties go down
And when I get you to the crib, I'm gonna put it down
You know you got me standing up so I gotta lay it down
We gon' wake up the neighbours, I'ma try to make you disabled

[Pre-Hook]
I'ma go harder than, lose your shit, wrap your legs around a nigga
Dancin' all on my pole, yeah, it's Breezy bitch, I'm a cold nigga
Get that shit, work that shit, pop it like a 4 wheeler
Give that bitch that dope dick, I guess that mean I'm a dope dealer

[Hook]
She started actin' up, I gave her more drink
Got pink in my paper cup, we pourin' up more drink
Your bitch lookin' at me, I know what that hoe think
'Bout to make her get it low for them bands
And just pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
'Bout to make her get it low for them bands
Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
'Bout to make her get it low for them bands

[Verse 2]
Throw them 50s and them 100s, wanna pop it, let it go
Girl, I like what I see, babe, I get what I want
Be good to me, be good to me, you super wet like a water flow
Girl, your friends ain't gotta know, but you with it

[Pre-Hook]
I'ma go harder than, lose your shit, wrap your legs around a nigga
Dancin' all on my pole, yeah, it's Breezy bitch, I'm a cold nigga
Get that shit, work that shit, pop it like a 4 wheeler
Give that bitch that dope dick, I guess that mean I'm a dope dealer

[Hook]
She started actin' up, I gave her more drink
Got pink in my paper cup, we pourin' up more drink
Your bitch lookin' at me, I know what that hoe think
'Bout to make her get it low for them bands
And just pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
'Bout to make her get it low for them bands
Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
'Bout to make her get it low for them bands
