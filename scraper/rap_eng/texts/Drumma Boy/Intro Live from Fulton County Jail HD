Yellow Lamborgini with the butter rims
True Religions sagging off my butter Timbs
These haters always acting like I owe 'em something
Like when they ass was down bad I never throwed 'em nothing
He say he ain't gon' fuck with me no more, OK
Tell the truth I never liked the lame, no way
Wishing back like why the hell they ever gave you money
Got bitches laughing at me, I ain't even said shit funny
Now ask yourself what really have you done for me
Cause I don't need noone to tote no guns for me
A hundred thousand dollar bribe I paid the bond for me
I copped a plea, ?, they said could set me free
(You have one minute remaining)
So if you lookin' for a flop, go and jump in the ocean
If I wasn't the boss I'd have to give myself a promotion
Tried to be the bigger man than ?
Don't make me have to send the goons to come back flashing wind
High definition paint job like a plasma ?
Got these bitches at the bus stop grabbing asthma pumps
Got a loyal chick, I always buy her Gucci pumps
Got a college girl, I keep her in the latest dunks
???
???? Robin jeans
Glock 45, I don't know what robbin' means
It's like you're talkin Japanese you're talkin' robbin' me
My girl she said it's over Gucci, I said OK
To tell the truth I never liked her ass, no way
??? baby your life's a crazy ?
I told you ??? look at all the ?? nigga
