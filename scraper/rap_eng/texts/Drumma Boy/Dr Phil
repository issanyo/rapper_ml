[Verse 1]
I'm so fucking swagged up, oh my god
Bitch fuck with me cause you know I'm straight hustling
Twelve cellphones with them k's like a Russian
Straight serving j's, yeah I'm strapped like a hustler
Buy a little pussy and your bitches want to fuck some
Damn it's a party cracking like it's bar mitzvah
Thirty six bitches on my dick cause I'm Sisqó
No homo bitch, I got broads out in Frisco
Ask my bitch if she limbo
Bitch better speak cause she know I play Nintendo
Bitch kiss my ring and she call me Carl's Winslow
I got about five hundred bitches
All of them love me
Oh my god﻿, all my bitches love me
Strapped with two nine's and they call me Willy Wonka
Crack a ho head and I'm working like a farmer
To sell guns and I'm cold like Norway
1989, put my bitch on a four-way
Heavily swagging, bitch check my meter
Pay her whole rent and she call me cousin Skeeter
We got money, we cashing out
Fuck a bitch
Why you hand-cuffing dudes, you a wife-beater
Bitch fuck with me, I pay that bitch when I see her
Pay a bitch head
Pay for head, I'm paying for head
Bitch fuck with me, I'mma tell her when I see her
Young Based God nigga, swag off the meter
Young Based God buy a bitch like reefer
Strapped with two nine's and they call me Quincy Jones
Got a AK and I look like Al Capone
Word around town I got five going for ten
Word around town I puts that Ying in that Yang
Ninety eight bitches and they call me Stephen King
Based God, Dr. Phil
