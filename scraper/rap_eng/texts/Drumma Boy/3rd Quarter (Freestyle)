[Intro]
Ay, 1738
Ayo, man they call me big ZooWap nigga
Fuck these fuck boys man
Squad shit, ZooGang

[Verse 1]
Black 650 on the road, start to gunning
Niggas make a diss song but want no problems
Black four fifth with the grip, who shot him?
Big ZooWap from the trap, what’s mobbing?
Gold chains on me, couple bands is the rocking
Make me feel fly so all I buy is Rob-
Got ten thousand dollars worth of J’s in my closet
For my girl, drop nine hundred dollars on the wallet though
P’s got six thousand dollars worth of Robins
Seventeen for my beamer, drop thirty on the jeep
Five bands for a Louis eye patch, omg
Not the Gucci one ‘cause you know a nigga stay flee
Fetty Wap from the bando, understand though
How the fuck you the man though? Go where you can’t go
What the fuck is your plan though? Ain’t got no bands though
And the niggas that I rock with keep hella ammo
Niggas tryna diss Fetty Wap, how you do that?
Like I ain’t helping niggas pop, nigga you mad
Put my city on the whole map, you ain’t do that
Talking ‘bout me, niggas get shot, why you do that?
Cause that boy running out the mouth, take a cool bath
Do his ass like the old school in a new class
Just bought a G37 and it’s too fast
Riding through this fuck boy’s hood, let the tool blast
Hop in my whip with his bitch on my cool ass
Just like his bitch, he a bitch, get his crew dragged
Bitch, we the squad of the year screaming ZooGang
Dice pull up on him, then, he kick just like Liu Kang
Montana hit him with the three, call him Lu Deng
Bitch, we the squad of the year screaming ZooGang
Dice pull up on him, then, he kick just like Liu Kang
Montana hit him with the three, call him Lu Deng
Squad!
