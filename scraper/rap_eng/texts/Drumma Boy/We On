[Verse 1]
What is your name, babe?
Girl, are you shy right now?
I'm not playing games, babe
'Cause you got my love locked down
Fuck who you came with
My fire's burning, baby
That incredible loud
Hope you smoking the same shit, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
We on, we on, we on, we on, yo yo
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (nigga, we on)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (nigga, we on)
Up in the air, we gone, yeah nigga, we on
We on now, we on, we on, we on, yo yo (we faded, smokin' on loud now)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (nigga, we made it, oh let's do it)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (let's do it, I'm ridin' around in that Ghost)
Oh yeah we on, oh yeah we on (we on right)

[Verse 2]
Body like a 'rari and baby, I been watching you for a while
And she know that she bad, she bad
Baby, I'm sorry, if I make you scream, oh
Guaranteed it's the best you've ever had (real shit)
I'm about to go deep, both feet, more sheets, more squeaks
Neighbors calling the police, now I gotta fuck her on the low key
I'm her homie, but she lonely and she calling me up
So I gotta give it to her good, but first I'ma tease her
Girl, I know just what you want, rough sex then slow it down
Bang bang bang, take it to the head
Yeah, yeah, girl, we're on
Oh, babe, oh yeah

[Chorus]
We on, we on, we on, we on, yo yo (yeah, we on)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (I said we on)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (nigga we on)
Up in the air, we gone, yeah nigga, we on
We on now, we on, we on, we on, yeah yo yo (we faded, smokin' on loud now)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo, yeah (nigga, we made it, oh let's do it)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (let's do it, I'm ridin' around in that Ghost)
I said hey girl, oh yeah we on, oh yeah we on

[Verse 3]
Yeah, nigga we on, fly by night
Nigga, who a fly buy?
South of France on a boat, swimmin' on the coast
Take the elevator to the helicopter
It's such a wonderful feelin', beautiful women
White linen, with white women and light women
Complementin' my clothes to let me know that I'm winnin'
One milli a show and I'ma collect interest
You can tell we on, nigga, just turn the TV on
I got a show in your city
Where your bitch? I bet she gone
This for Virginia, Virginia
Just look at all of these asses
I'm ballin' hard, ballin' hard (yeah, yeah)
Fuck you talkin' 'bout practice?

[Chorus]
We on, we on, we on, we on, yo yo
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (nigga, we on)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (nigga, we on)
Up in the air, we gone, yeah nigga, we on
We on now, we on, we on, we on, yo yo (we faded, smokin' on loud now)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (nigga, we made it, oh let's do it)
We on, we on, we on, yo yo (let's do it, I'm ridin' around in that Ghost)
Oh yeah we on, oh yeah we on (we on right)
