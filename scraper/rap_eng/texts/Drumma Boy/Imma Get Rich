I'm a get rich or die trying like 50
Ball like Hov', pop bottles like Diddy
Bitch, you're only visiting, 'cause this is my city
Blame it on your hoes just to say that I did it. [x2]

I'm official like black and white stripes
That bitch you're calling your wife, I done had her like twice
I see you're watching, nigga, analyze right
Observe, I'm about to reach satelite heights
I lay my fucking law down, I don't take the shit
Ciroc bottles on the table, I don't drink this shit
No disrespect to Diddy, I do it for the hoes
Cameras in this bitch, we shootin Juv' exposed
I'm killing 'em momma, on my Louis and Dior shit
Juvi', you're winner, all your haters better fall bitch
I need a billion dollars cash, nothing counterfeited
Ain't got that Russel Simmons money, but I'm down to get it
Who, me? I'm tryin' to be a nigga rude group
I'm about to drop my own Juvenile fruit juice
Pull off, I act like Hov' and get a shoe deal
Fuck the world, the first day I ship 100 mil

I'm a get rich or die trying like 50
Ball like Hov' pop bottles like Diddy
Bitch, you're only visiting, 'cause this is my city
Blame it on your hoes just to say that I did it. [x2]

Customized French suits, crocodile shoes
I'm elevated, it's all the conversation about you
I see you nigga living like you're seeing in a dream
'Cause I got translation imagination in a grin
So why the contracts that I'm trying to get paid
I got homes, I can say you anything and and say you're here from
Fly in the motherfucker swag, I got wheez
And I'm running like a company like Jimmy Ivine
You know you're getting money when you bitch are in Forbes
And you ain't gonna say a shit to get a bitch under the folds
And in the fin, the life it's gonna take it's own course
Nobody helping me and we open his own doors
Making too much money to be worried about credit
We're tired in my city as we're chatting like Betty's
Niggas don't get it and they act like it's a game torn
They won't mean the telethon, how could I explain it to them?

I'm a get rich or die trying like 50
Ball live Hov' pop bottles like Diddy
Bitch, you're only visiting, 'cause this is my city
Blame it on your hoes just to say that I did it. [x2]
