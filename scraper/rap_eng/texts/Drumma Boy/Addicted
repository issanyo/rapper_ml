[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I said that I was going to quit but I can't
Every other day I'm sipping on another pint
I can't stay too long, cause she gonna catch feelings
I just catch flights, and chase millions
I just left from Cleveland on the way to Philly
I salute all the real niggas because it ain't that many
Jump out the foreign, hop in the Chevy with the big block in it
In the suite with 4 hoes and I'm pouring em shots of Remy
She fuck with me cause she want the real
She wanna ride me and she swear she can handle the wheel
I told her label come with more money, I don't want the deal
My cup super dirty, my blunt super fat
Addicted to these stacks

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Out here steady chasing scrilla, man this shit addictive
Fucking with these bad bitches, man this shit addictive
I gotta do em she keep saying that she never did it
I said that I was through drinking syrup but this shit addictive
If you was looking for your bitch, she with me, she ain't missin'
You looking for your clientele, they shoppin' in my kitchen
That trap money addictive, that trap money addictive
Yeah this shit addictive, man this shit addictive

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I'ma go and get it til them people come get me
Keep saying I'ma quit, plug won't let me
If I'm in the hole then my niggas in the hole with me
I only wanted 25 made me take the whole 50
When I say its mine, yeah I mean a whole city
I got a gold desert eagle, yeah that hoe pretty
And its crazy as it seems, ain't no in between
The users are the hustlers and the dealers are the fiends
Have that lawyer money ready and take care of your team
When a nigga get in power he might do crazy things
That's cause nothing is restricted
Find your poison then pick it
The curse and the gift is, that this shit is addictive

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Out here steady chasing scrilla, man this shit addictive
Fucking with these bad bitches, man this shit addictive
I gotta do em she keep saying that she never did it
I said that I was through drinking syrup but this shit addictive
If you was looking for your bitch, she with me, she ain't missin'
You looking for your clientele, they shoppin' in my kitchen
That trap money addictive, that trap money addictive
Yeah this shit addictive, man this shit addictive
