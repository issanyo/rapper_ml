[Verse 1]
Now look at us, we can't stay away from each other
Can't get enough, can't get this feel from no other
You got me stuck, this was supposed to be nothing
But you made it something, 'cause something got me hooked on your loving

[Refrain]
Got me like oh, oh, oh
I be on it day and night, can't get it off my mind, girl
Can't let it go
And we both know it's a lie when you say it's our last time

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driving me crazy
It's all I think about when I'm with you
We started it, baby
And now I caught up on what love put us through

[Chorus]
Look what it do
Look what it do
Look what it, look what it do
Look what it do
Look what it, look what it do
Between me and you, girl
Look what it, look what it do
Look what it do, girl
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between

[Verse 2]
Say you never had one, oh no
To give you a buzz and get you way up
Baby you a bad one
You're all that I want, I'm all that you want
You need a rush
The kind that you get when my hands be all over your body
Body

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh
I be on it day and night, I can't get it off my mind, girl
Go
And we both know it's a lie when we say it's our last time

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driving me crazy
It's all I think about when I'm with you
We started it, baby
And now I caught up on what love put us through

[Chorus]
Look what it do
Look what it do
Look what it, look what it do
Look what it do
Look what it, look what it do
Between me and you, girl
Look what it, look what it do
Look what it do, girl
Between me and you
Between me and you
Between me and you
