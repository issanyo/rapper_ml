[Intro]
Listen to this track, bitch

[Verse 1]
Like Tommy Lee and Pamela I'm fucking on the camera
More stamina than Animals Gucci is no amateur
Jeru the Damaja could damage you or handle you
2 girls on my bike, one on the back one on the handle bars
Ferrari F-430, so I call that bitch Tarantula
Got Canada on Calendar so shout out to my manager
I walk through in South Africa
I jumped in my foreign Acura
I flip it just like spatula
So suck me just like Dracula
Polo like a college boy
No I'm not a college boy
I am a So Icey boy I'm tatted like a biker boy
We are the So Icey gang tatted like a biker gang
Dreaded up redded up
Wetted up and bet it up bitch you don't want bet
Pull up in my Chevy Vett
Nah you ain't ready yet
Wetter than your girl get
Dolce 'Bana, Dolce shades, Don't you wanna see the boy?
See the boy, see the boy
Come and take a Polaroid, Polaroid
Camera flash, camera flash I see your ass
Looking with your looking ass
So come and take a camera flash
Jewelry game amazing
Car game crazy
Gucci Mane LaFlare walking 'round the city, say cheese
