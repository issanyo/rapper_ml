[Hook: Young Dolph]
Everytime she come around she shear shit down
She one of the baddest bitches in town
She have model nggas flexing, pulling bands out
How she live, and she makes that ass
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
No shit
Lil momma one of the baddest bitches around here, hands down
Hand her downtown, thirteen flowing
Inhaling my weed, while she was making that ass bounce
Dranking [?] with her, and smoking out the ounce
[?] was making the movie on the couch
She got a nigga, and I got her sneaking out the house
Walking 'round in her panties with no blouse
Fucking with other niggas bitches, yeah that's worth [?]
And money start calling, then it's time to bounce
Time is money, money is power
They swear they smoking loud, but we smoking louder

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Everytime she come around she shear shit down
She one of the baddest bitches in town
She have model nggas flexing, pulling bands out
How she live, and she makes that ass
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bitch bounce

[Verse 2: Drumma Boy]
Look at how she bouncin'
Get on top [?]
Big ol' booty make a nigga spill' that allowance
Meanest demeanor, say she gotta have it
Put it out the hat I wanna see her do that magic
She got that circus head, so I told that bitch the clown
Watch her lick it up, watch her lick that bitch down
Spend my keys in the [?], then that bitch bounce
Circulating through the city on my paper route
Join my boy Young Dolph strictly for the strippers
When we hit the club, ballin' bitches come get with us
Got that motherfucker bouncin', yeah you know we been it
And where we go, we gon' keep that bitch [?]

[Hook: Young Dolph]
