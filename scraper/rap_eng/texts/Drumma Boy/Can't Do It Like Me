Drumma boy, oh yeah, oh yeah boy
Warrup drum? Oh yeah, you feel me?
Oh, that’s what we doin’ man
Doing up on a lot of people
2 chaaaaiiinnnzz
One thing I know
These niggas cannot do it like me
2 chaaaaiiinnnzz
[Hook] x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Most these niggas try but they can’t do it
That’s unlikely
Know this when you see the work
You know that is unlikely
A replicated imitation, you can’t beat me slightly
You know soon as you hear the track
No question mark or might be
I’m bishop they buy me, I’m off the hook, off the hook
Got these niggas in check mate, off the hook, off the hook
Bitch I’m bout the turnt up, let them lamers burn up
Niggas ain’t got my work at the dawn
Hustling till the sun up
Continue to set the standards, rearrange the plans
Ever since I’ve been in, I’ve been stacking them brands
From a …off, like firecrackers, I’m too hot to tame
For the e way, I’m rolling out, just stay out of my lane
[Hook] x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
When I slow down they say speed it up
When I speed up they say slow it down
I’m money bound
I’m so high, I could eat a cloud
Mister child, y’all … your girl is so thirsty now
My man swag like … every verse is a murder trial
Versatile, style on top of style on top of style yeah
When I say I hop the I stand for eye lens
When I fly, no eye temps, when I land, I buy them
New clothes, your hoes, ain’t shit, I’ll buy them
Dollar signs my eyes lids, now I see the big picture
HD, flat screens, TV's, same size as Paul Pierce
And ain’t no comparing us, man we do it major
And if they ain’t talking bout shit
Tell them eat so toilet paper
[Hook] x 2
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t do it like me
Can’t do it like me, can’t what
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
Can’t do it like me, like me, like me, oh yeah
