[Verse 1]
I came from stealin' out them corner sto's and robbin' people's shit
Tell me, what am I supposed to do? I'm tryna hit a lick
My mama working all them fucking jobs and still ain't getting shit
That's why I gotta run my bands up and put her in a Bent, yeah
Lord, I know I ain't doing right
But can you protect me all through the night?
I gotta take care of my small one
I gotta get this shit for all them
Rup up the racks, take all his shit, he ain't getting it back
We riding 'round with them drums and them mags, can't be that leader you want me to be
Do you know how much pain I've been through?
Or why I'm pouring all the shit that I do?

[Hook]
I had to earn all my stripes, can't be defeated
Ain't no minimum wage for trippin', teethin'
I keep my gun and my knife, some niggas greedy
Ain't no way we gon' fall, bitch, I'm achievin'
I had to earn all my stripes, can't be defeated
Ain't no minimum wage for trippin', teethin'
I keep my gun and my knife, some niggas greedy
Ain't no way we gon' fall, bitch, I'm achievin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, they feel like they with me, I know that they ain't, no
They act like this 'cause tryna cover the hate, yeah
That they having on me
They don't wanna see me eat, but nigga, I gotta feed my seeds
Take care of my whole family, make sure they live judge free
Only thing that I be running from is a bitch with some fleas
Huh, drop-top, fuck a fo'-do'
We smoking gas, they on mojo
I could feel they hate from over here
I swear, these niggas changing with the years, yeah
Mama told me, "Boy, don't fuck with queers," yeah

[Hook]
I had to earn all my stripes, can't be defeated
Ain't no minimum wage for trippin', teethin'
I keep my gun and my knife, some niggas greedy
Ain't no way we gon' fall, bitch, I'm achievin'
I had to earn all my stripes, can't be defeated
Ain't no minimum wage for trippin', teethin'
I keep my gun and my knife, some niggas greedy
Ain't no way we gon' fall, bitch, I'm achievin'

[Bridge]
Have you ever had to sleep with no lights on?
It's freezing cold, what kept me warm was my Glock, dog
But where I'm from, it's fuck a job, we meddle for hire
Give yo' ass a shower, wrap him up in them wires
Don't think it's a game
Bitch, stay in yo' lane
I swear to God, me and you are not the same, no

[Hook]
I had to earn all my stripes, can't be defeated
Ain't no minimum wage for trippin', teethin'
I keep my gun and my knife, some niggas greedy
Ain't no way we gon' fall, bitch, I'm achievin'
I had to earn all my stripes, can't be defeated
Ain't no minimum wage for trippin', teethin'
I keep my gun and my knife, some niggas greedy
Ain't no way we gon' fall, bitch, I'm achievin'
