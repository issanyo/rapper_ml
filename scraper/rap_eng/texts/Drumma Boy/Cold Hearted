[Intro: Kevin McCall]
I'm cold hearted, (cold hearted)
They say I get it from my father (cold hearted)
I'm cold hearted (cold hearted)
More time I don't wanna be bothered (cold hearted)

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
No no, I've been so many places chasing paper under the sun
Wanna start a fam but girl I can't be faithful to one
I got a problem, and it ain't like I don't feel for you babe
And I hate to see them tears on your face
But I can't erase all the memories we've made
Got my brain going crazy, it's like I'm stuck in the maze
Don't lose your hope in me, but if you keep the faith
All you secrets is safe with me take the shit to the grave

[Hook: Kevin McCall]

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
No no, cause I'm a heart breaker (heart breaker)
I'm a heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
Heart breaker, heart breaker, heart breaker, (breaker)
I'm drinking champagne from out the bottle

[Verse 2: Gucci Man]
I'm drinking Ace of Spades like that shit bottle water
I'm drinking Ace of Spades like that shit bottle water
I got the preacher's daughter doing all the shit I taught her
Go so hard I might break them hoes
Dick so hard I might break her jaw
Cold hearted I ain't got no heart
Broke bitch she don't want no job
How you gonna help when times get hard
Ride or die, but she ain't got no car
Push button I ain't got no key
Want to marry me and take half my stash
Break her heart broke the bitch in half
Hate these hoes but I love my fans
We have a doubt but the shit won't last
It's a plane crash the way I drop my bags
Hand in hand the way I made this cash
I ain't trying to give it up so fast
Blast smash now you in my past
100 bags used to wipe my ass
Ace of Spades I don't need no glass
Got racks in my pants so the hoes go dance

[Hook: Kevin McCall]
