[Intro]
Listen to this track bitch

[Hook]
Yo I ain’t slept in a couple days
But I been getting money every day
That paper come so fast I gotta fuck it up
That paper come so fast I gotta fuck it up
Aye I ain’t slept in a couple days
But I been getting money every day
That paper come so fast I gotta fuck it up
That paper come so fast I gotta fuck it up

[Verse 1]
Benz coup nigga 150
Maybach, that bitch 220
Flexing on these pussy niggas I been getting money
Got finessed at nineteen I went and bought a dummy
Sold a thousand four ways until I got a brick
I remember cooking dope until I got sick
Got a plug in the bay and I say fuck the yay
My bitch been cleaning up the house and she found 60k
If it don’t make dollars it ain’t making sense
I ain’t had nowhere to stay now I pay five rents
It’s been five days and I ain’t even changed clothes
It’s time to move the trap but I don’t wanna change stores

[Hook]
Yo I ain’t slept in a couple days
But I been getting money every day
That paper come so fast I gotta fuck it up
That paper come so fast I gotta fuck it up
Aye I ain’t slept in a couple days
But I been getting money every day
That paper come so fast I gotta fuck it up
That paper come so fast I gotta fuck it up
