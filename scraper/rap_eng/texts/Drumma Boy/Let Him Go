[Verse 1: Pricetag]
Yeah, check me out girl I'm tired of the creeping
Tired of the hiding, tired of the sneaking
You looking over your shoulder every time that we meeting
Saying I can only call your phone on the weekend
It's not fair, I'm just tryna expand
Take you out and buy you all of the best brands
I never been the type of dude to knock the next man
You don't need an altar, to see that I'm the best man
No flowers on the floor, no bride no groom
All I see is pain inside your room
Texting my phone saying he treating you rough
If he ain't cheating one minute then hes beating you up
And it sucks
Cause I'm just tryna hide it with the hugs
But you can't even see it cause your blinded by the love
But pass all that girl, I'm missing your lips
So I'm a write you this letter, naw listen to this... let's go!

[Hook: Oktane]
You realized you ain't feeling him at all today
And there's really nothing more to say
And you seeing that the feelings all gone away
Girl I'm only one call away
You gotta let him go, go, go, go
You gotta let him go, go, go, go

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Um baby, ever since I got your digits
All I hear from you is you saying you at your limit
Baby it'll be so much better if I did it
And me and you can make the world jealous if you with it
Let's be real I'm who you tryna be next to
Only time you smile with him, is if I text you
It's obvious you can't see what he's bringing you
And rapping ain't getting the point across
I'm a sing to you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pricetag]
Look, now as I'm reading what your heart wrote
I see your ex is the reason that your hearts broke
So girl come play on my team, the game is right
I'm just tryna be the person that can change your life

[Verse 4: Oktane]
I'm tired of calling him knowing he ain't gon never pick up
And every time you think about it you ready to give up

[Verse 5: Pricetag]
And girl I understand that the pain is strong
But you can come with the boss and leave the lame alone

[Hook]
