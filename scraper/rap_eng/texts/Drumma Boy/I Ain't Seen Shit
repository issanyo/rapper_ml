[Intro:]
This is a DJ Scream public service announcement
It's 20-13
No more tolerance for snitches
No more tolerance for bitch ass niggas
No tolerance for fuck niggas, you understand?

[Verse 1:]
Nigga get go snitching, your ass in the ditch
Ain't nobody straight, a nigga or bitch
I don't trust nobody when it come to wiff
You do your shit alone, cause you won't tell on self
Let me take that back, it's some damn fools out
Hear the police shoot they ass like a puppeteer
Niggas getting caught with bricks and free back on the bricks
You tellin ass niggas, I can see straight through that shit
Go to jail nigga get his ass slice to piece
That's why you rattin ass niggas checking pc
Niggas know the consequences of this drug dealin
You can have a long run if you ain't squeelin

[Hook:]
Cali is where I get my green from
Cake city is where I get my lean from
Miami is where I get the beans from
And if you get caught, I don't know where they came from
I ain't seen shit and I don't know shit
I ain't seen shit and I don't know shit
I ain't seen shit and I don't know shit
The number one rule in this game: don't snitch

[Verse 2:]
Ran to the cilian, like I move kilograms
Laugh at you lames like, I done smoke some helium
Have to hustle for my bread, means I have to make it
Try to pay me and you owe me mask up and take it
Death before dishonor, so your honor I can't tell you shit
Just another ghetto nigga out here tryin to get rich
For Memphis 10 but the drugs flow like the Mississippi
We poppin eggs, pills and molly, let's say we trippy
It's indie clippy on the 9 means extra bullets
Off in your ass try to rob and I'm a pull it
Trick exposed, body froze, ain't no soul inside em
You in the morgue, tag on toes them pistols, I hide em

[Hook:]
Cali is where I get my green from
Cake city is where I get my lean from
Miami is where I get the beans from
And if you get caught, I don't know where they came from
I ain't seen shit and I don't know shit
I ain't seen shit and I don't know shit
I ain't seen shit and I don't know shit
The number one rule in this game: don't snitch

[Outro:]
And there it is my niggas
Cheez N Dope
Project Pat
DJ Scream nigga
My album Long Live the Hustle coming soon
Street music at it's finest
Til the next go around
Salute to the motherfuckin streets nigga
