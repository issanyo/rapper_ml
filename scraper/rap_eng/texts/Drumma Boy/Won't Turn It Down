[Intro]
Drumma Boy

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Give me your number
Do you want me to call you?
Girl, I want you, like an alcoholic
I'm so drunk, I'm so drowned
Put you in a cup, let me pour that up
That Cali weed, roll it up, roll it up
Now I've been thinking 'bout the things that we gon' do tonight
Thinking 'bout the games I'ma play with you tonight
Wanna go first? Take off
If I bring you to the plate, will you play ball?
I'ma hit it hard like a paintball
Like a soldier I'm 'bout to go AWOL, you horny

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jacquees]
She wanna play? I'ma let her ride, ride, ride it, yeah
All day, I'ma let her try, try, try, yeah
Get ready, on your mark, get set, go
When I'm swimming in there I'ma do the breaststroke, let's go

[Chorus: Jacquees & Chris Brown]
She told me, sing another love song please
She got her hands on me, like, ''Baby, I need Jacquees''
Girl, it ain't nothing in this world for free
I gotta put it down before I wear the crown, crown
I won't turn it down, down, down, no, oh
I won't turn it down, down, down, no, oh
I won't turn it down, down, down, no, baby, turn up
With this AK, I'm ready to bust, I won't turn it down, oh no

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah, okay, look, they say you are what you eat, fuck that, you are who you feed
A list, the pussy the greatest, when I'm goin' raw dog, nigga, fuck a plan B
Understand me? I got her singin' them high notes, she holdin' my Grammy
A nigga like a laundromat, when I'm eatin' her panties, come from the A, but she live in Miami (ow!)
All the bitches in Hollywood, get this molly wood, week days be jumpin'
But the weekend, bring the freaks in, I need a bitch straight up outta Bompton
B's up, what up 5? Wifebeater and them all red 5's
Kill the pussy, I deal the pussy and girl, I'm 'bout to make that ass come alive (yeah)
How you make it do that? Gon' and ride this wave, bitch, like a du-rag
Zero to sixty through your neighborhood, shout out to the homies with blue flags
This new Jag', got new tags, on top, nigga, where you at? (Hahaha)
You wanna tell me how to act, huh? Nigga, this my movie (what? Yeah!)

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
She wanna play? I'ma let her ride, ride, ride it
All day, I'ma let her try, try, try, yeah
Get ready, on your mark, get set, go
When I'm swimming in there I'ma do the breaststroke, let's go

[Chorus: Jacquees & Chris Brown]
She told me, sing another love song please
She got her hands on me, like, ''Baby, I need Jacquees''
Girl, it ain't nothing in this world for free
I gotta put it down before I wear the crown, crown
I won't turn it down, down, down, no, oh
I won't turn it down, down, down, no, oh
I won't turn it down, down, down, no, baby, turn up
With this AK, I'm ready to bust down, I won't turn it down, oh no

[Outro: Jacquees]
If you give it up, that's when we gon' fall in love
Give it up, that's when we gon' fall in love
Give it up, that's when we gon' fall in love
Give it up, give it up
