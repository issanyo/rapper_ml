Girl you’re hotter than all them hoes modeling and I just keep on tipping
Pouring out them dollars and it’s about to be a twerk off, be a twerk off
Pull your skirt down, take your shirt off

[Lloyd]
Anything she can do, you can do better
I don’t see nobody here who’s better than you
Girl, I love to see you twerk, love the way you go to work
You be killing competition cause you let it go berserk
Come and get this money, girl it’s yours
I can keep them dollars coming, they say when it rains it pours
Throwing money to the ceiling 'till it’s covering the floor
It’s a twerk off, but we know who’s winning (you, of course)

Grab some girlfriends and let's synch up with my partner and them
We can all go to the penthouse and just vibe out and put you in the wig
Girl if you in, shake it like you'll never shake it again
Take it so deep, I don’t know when it end
I know it’s no mistake, you should be in first place

First you gotta pop it, then you gotta drop it
Even though the haters watching, you don’t have to stop it
Calling murder cause you killing when you take it to the ceiling
Got me losing all control when you work it on the pole
You know you the best cause you gon' do what she won’t do
You keep it out the box, them other chicks be typical
That’s why I throw it up, you love how I be tipping you
Before you start this twerk off, baby take that shirt off and;

The way she work that pole, it’s time for her to work mine
And she suck it so good, I just might go blind
And her ass so fat, damn that chick so fine
She okay in the face but Beyoncé from behind
She clapped her ass for cheese cause my chips stacking like Pringles
I’m rich and I’m single, blowing twenty thousand in singles
Baddest chick you’ve never seen before
I make it rain, they clean the floor; I throw a stack, she come and get it
I’ll throw some more, I’m not going broke
Booty like no other, she get it from her mother
Throwing bands in the club, smoking more than Chris Tucker.
Weed naps and weed raps, I can’t stop, no relapse
Nothing but models, tripping on molly
Take ‘em back to the crib and continue the party
