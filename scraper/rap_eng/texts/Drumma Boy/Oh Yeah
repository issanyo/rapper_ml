[Bridge]
Just go 'head and do the right thing, do the right thing
Do the right thing, oh, just go 'head and do the right thing
Do the right thing, and girl, if you won't get naughty
I don't need a key I just push buttons, start it

[Hook]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the, on the floor
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, girl, you got my heart
Oh yeah, oh yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the on the floor
Oh yeah, oh , yeah, girl, you got my heart
Do it, do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1]
Look, now a nigga spend 100 thousand on bottles, baby girl, where you goin'?
Ugly girls be quiet, all them models screamin', perform it
Two bad ones with me, it's three somethin' in the mornin', get it?
Jump humpin' 'til the mornin', I get it, her mouth open, she yawnin', get it?
I been on her all day, but if she come way I'ma put on my shades
Still givin' me face, but all your girlfriends hatin' 'cause you M.I.A
But you over my place, I'm the king in my city you can have your way
I'm the camera man, set the camera up, put your booty up, then we can press replay

[Pre-Hook]
Your friends can't tell me nothing
You're leaving with me, I know you want me
It's in your eyes, don't tell me lies
Don't need no disguise, lemme give it to you like oh yeah

[Hook]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the, on the floor
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, girl, you got my heart
Oh yeah, oh yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the on the floor
Oh yeah, oh , yeah, girl, you got my heart
Do it, do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, we gon' celebrate like it's a holiday
You been lying to me all this time and girl, I want you to cross the line
So I can take you to a place, yeah
Where both of us can roll around in covers and do some crazy things, oh

[Pre-Hook]
Your friends can't tell me nothing
You're leaving with me, I know you want me
It's in your eyes, don't tell me lies
Don't need no disguise, lemme give it to you like oh yeah

[Hook]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, girl, you a pro
Oh yeah, oh yeah, on the, on the floor

Do it, do it, do it, do it

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you a pro
On the, on the floor
Yeah, girl, you got my heart
Do it, do it, do it, do it

[Outro]
Just go 'head and do the right thing, do the right thing
Do the right thing oh, just go 'head and do the right thing
Do the right thing, and girl, if you won't get naughty
I don't need no key I just push button start it
