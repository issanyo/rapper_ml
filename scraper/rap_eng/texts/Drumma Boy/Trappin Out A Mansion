This that high class street music
Paper Route Empire
(Intro)
This that high class street music
Paper Route Empire
It’s that Dolph shit
You smell me?
Everything extra stupid
Extra stupid
Remember I told you that

(Hook)
Hit my white girl from the back, bumping Marilyn Manson
Saw her in Los Angeles trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Hit my white girl from the back, bumping Marilyn Manson
Chilling in Los Angeles trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion

(Verse)
You bitches love Dolph money, I don’t know what you thought, man
This watch cost a Benz and this coopy cost a house, man
Nothing but designer grade pistols in my house, man
Met your bitch at the club but I fucked her on my couch, man
Belfast – that’s my city, but cash taller than my hood, though
High class street, nigga, but still I fuck with hood hoes
Smoking weed, fucking white bitches, trappin’ out a mansion
Countin bread and having rough sex with Khloe Kardashian
Put down the jeans sagging, all these diamonds flashing
How could your bitch pass this shit up, home boy, I’m just asking?
Got her bent over, pulling her hair, bumping that Marilyn Manson
Trappin’ out a mansion

(Hook)
Hit my white girl from the back, bumping Marilyn Manson
Saw her in Los Angeles trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Hit my white girl from the back, bumping Marilyn Manson
Chilling in Los Angeles trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion

(Verse)
Mansion full of white girls, blue ass blonde hair
Green ass, black hair
The features like a black girl
Think she got booty shots, just look how it poke out back there
Well fuck, I let, I got her second bells and counting racks there
Used to shop in mall in Memphis, now I shop in Beverly Hills
As a kid grew up with no license, he know I got several cribs
I’m always on the run, I can never sit still
Fuck the world and how I feel
If it ain’t a couple of mill then fuck that deal, it ain’t for me
I need seven million or more nigga, just to sign up
Gotta pay somebody a quarter of million just to find us
Marble floors and white hoes, trappin’ out a mansion

(Hook)
Hit my white girl from the back, bumping Marilyn Manson
Saw her in Los Angeles trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Hit my white girl from the back, bumping Marilyn Manson
Chilling in Los Angeles trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
Trappin’ out a mansion, trappin’ out a mansion
