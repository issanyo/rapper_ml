[Bridge: Kap G]
Partner hit me up, "I know your fam got that ganja"
He said "I need a plug, no iPhone charger"
Ayy I got trust issues man, you probably with the feds
Ayy fuck a middle-man, he need that direct connect

[Hook: Kap G]

[Verse 1: Kap G]
One call, that's all, we going to the border
I'm talking Taco Bell drive-thru, he got your order
Jose say "You trust this man?" That's my fucking homie
Don't be wrong [?] he gon' put you in a coma
Pat him down, if you're wild I'mma fucking shoot ya
Cut off your head, throw it in the fucking Chattahoochee
Look at me when I'm talking to you, this game ain't made for no motherfucking coochies
I'mma start you off with them Church's Chicken, pack it up in the trunk, that's two-piece

[Bridge: Kap G]
Them tacos coming to America like Eddie Murphy
If you ain't snitching homes, then your ass don't concern me
[?] he the drug lord
Early morning fiends lining up, no Jordan Concords

[Hook: Kap G]
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Cayenne wrist game, whippin like a new sport
Cooking like a Chinese spot in the food court
Taco Bell side nigga, Greenbriar parking lot
Back and forth all day, you'll think that I shop a lot
Jose got them tacos and they rap like enchiladas
Take 'em out the rap, they shine like platinum leather Pradas
A-Town Medellin, address me like I'm Pablo
More cars in my front yard than the V103 car show
You know I like my taco.. same color sour cream
White as OJ Bronco, Johnson Johnson, powder team
It's time to geek, vamanos, I can make 'em vanish
My nigga bitch in Dade County got me speaking Spanish

[Hook: Kap G]
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)

[Verse 3: Kap G]
Police raided in his house like he from LA
Now he ain't never coming home like he in 3rd base
He talking to the feds, they talking 35 to life
Unless he tell them who his plug, they gon' give him five
I got it from Jose, we supposed to meet in Cali
And y'all don't wanna fuck with him, probably kill your family
I'mma call and set it up, say I want a millions worth
Aye don't fuck with this turf, that shit there gon' get you hurt

[Bridge: Kap G]
They got Jose, no bail cuz they know he can pay that bread
No barber shop, now Jose put some migos on my head
Gotta make a run, this shit ain't safe, gotta hop up on that plane
Turns out they killed my partner's wife and kids, no Damon Wayans

[Hook: Kap G]
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye
Jose got dem tacos (Woo!)
Jose got dem tacos, aye
