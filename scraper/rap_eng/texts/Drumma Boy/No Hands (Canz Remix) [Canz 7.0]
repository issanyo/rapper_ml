[Chorus: Kelly Berenfeld]
Girl you be donatin’, got me in a trance
Food drive turn me up, ladies bring your cans
Imma sip my Campbell’s and you’re gonna stack them bands
I wanna throw this money so you better bring your cans
Girl, stack up from the floor and we gonna keep on raisin’ more
All I wanna do is sit back and feed the hungry and proceed to throw this cash

[Verse 1: Ethan Scheper, Aniketh Dumpala & Elliott Schultz]
Ayo Pierre, come out here
We donatin’ cans I swear
I got bratwurst like I’m Herr
Stackin’ high no need to stare
Hungry eatin’ good like they Rick Ross
Drippin’ in Hunt’s, yeah I got that sauce
Prov takin’ dubs, don’t take no loss
Feedin’ the hungry like we the Red Cross

Cuz my man catchin’ cans like Randy Moss
And I’m tan in the sand but I’m cold like frost
And no matter the plan I got it lock
And I’m feedin’ the fam all across the block
But lemme slow down cuz I’m getting too hot
Imma pour up that chunky and stir up the pot
Cans on my body and cans in my sock
With Mr. Sahd I milly rock

Saucin’ them cans like I’m Chef Boyardee
Runnin’ this track like my name is Coach T
You know that we stackin’, my bars never lackin’
Big P never slackin’ so don’t talk to me
They chattin’, I’m snappin’, I bodied this beat
I’m in the short shorts like I’m running X-C
Providence stackin’ and stackin’ them cans
Feed all the hungry up in the QC!

[Chorus: Kelly Berenfeld]
Girl you be donatin’, got me in a trance
Food drive turn me up, ladies bring your cans
Imma sip my Campbell’s and you’re gonna stack them bands
I wanna throw this money so you better bring your cans
Girl, stack up from the floor and we gonna keep on raisin’ more
All I wanna do is sit back and feed the hungry and proceed to throw this cash

[Verse 2: Aniketh Dumpala]
(What she say?)
She said look ma, no hands
And you know I got them cans
And I’m with Duncan, I’m with Bowen
You know I got lots of fans
Grocery bags with donations
And you know I feed the nation
I got an expectation to fill up my generation
And who you with, and what’s your name?
Not Travis Scott but I’m LaFlame
“Bring them cans” what I proclaim
I should be in the Canz hall of fame
Whippin’ the Civic, you know I play cricket
Like Willy Wonka got gold on my ticket
Whippin’ the Wraith, Prov in first place
Stackin’ my cans way up to outer space
I got them collards, I got them greens
Call me Lil Boat cuz I’m King of the Teens
Shootin’ out cans like a tennis machine
Feeding the hungry all 2018
Boy I got beans, and they garbanzo
And I’m big ballin’, just like I’m Lonzo
Passin’ out dishes, just like I’m Rondo
Prov gon’ feed the hungry pronto
(Y’all know!)

[Chorus: Kelly Berenfeld]
Girl you be donatin’, got me in a trance
Food drive turn me up, ladies bring your cans
Imma sip my Campbell’s and you’re gonna stack them bands
I wanna throw this money so you better bring your cans
Girl, stack up from the floor and we gonna keep on raisin’ more
All I wanna do is sit back and feed the hungry and proceed to throw this cash

[Verse 3: Bryce Desai]
Uh, uh, uh, it’s Young Fro, ok
C-A-R-R-O-T I’m at Food Lion with my broccoli, uh
I be going ham cuz mama didn’t buy no turkey
And we all donatin’ good but you know that Prov the best
Cuz I look up at the score and tell AK “Give it a rest,” nah
Stackin’ stackin’ everyday, refried beans come andele
My Campbell’s stuck on overload, my soup never evaporate
And you know Big P dominate
They watchin’ us like Dr. Dre
Imma feed the hungry, peanut butter stayin’ crunchy
Prov runnin’ CMS like an athlete
Cuz I’m saucin’ like I’m Carson with the neck brace
Sloppy toppy yeah we poppin’ we in first place
Get about hunnid cans on a bad day
Six ring pops on like I’m MJ
Go, go, go, go, go and do your dance
And imma feed the hungry while I’m stackin’ up my cans, man

[Chorus: Kelly Berenfeld]
Girl you be donatin’, got me in a trance
Food drive turn me up, ladies bring your cans
Imma sip my Campbell’s and you’re gonna stack them bands
I wanna throw this money so you better bring your cans
Girl, stack up from the floor and we gonna keep on raisin’ more
All I wanna do is sit back and feed the hungry and proceed to throw this cash
