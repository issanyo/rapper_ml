[Verse 1]
Yeah, look, well it's that real shit, straight from Virginia
Down for my niggas I really ride
All the bus, gotta see me cop
Country nigga bought a yacht, Rolex the watch
Take the roof off that motherfucker just to shut down the block
Niggas starvin', look at my pockets, they fill up with knots
You mechanical, I will damage you, I'm somethin' you not
These bitches compliment my tendencies, tattoos and nose rings
This is how we ride on our enemies
Hate it, but you love it, out in public, you duckin'
My niggas got no regards for the repercussions
Promethazine and weed, they see the reaper comin'
I see you mollyin', but I'm tryna teach you somethin'

[Chorus]
What they don't know, yeah, it's just the life of a young nigga
That's what they don't know, yeah, it's just the life of a young nigga
Roll up, alright, yeah, welcome to the life of a young nigga
I'm fucked up, this just the life of a

[Verse 2]
No more days of me not gettin' paid, my paper straight
No more shade, hatin' on a nigga, I'm startin' a bank
Heatin' up, mama wasn't even make minimum wage
She get her on TV show, act Hollywood and L.A
I said wassup mama? You doin' it, lookin' like a bad bitch
Talkin' hella records, remember when you ain't had shit
I guess you on now, let me fall back
Let you do you and calm down, let that pussy get worn out
The club feeling like high school
Everybody in cliques, bitches act like they like you
Niggas sucked the most dick, can I get in? What up, my nigga?
Only wanna see these bitches, won't you shut up, my nigga? Yikes

[Chorus]
What they don't know, yeah, it's just the life of a young nigga
That's what they don't know, yeah, it's just the life of a young nigga
Roll up, alright, yeah, welcome to the life of a young nigga
I'm fucked up, this just the life of a

[Verse 3]
Alright, I swear they writin' my third verses in cursive
A catalyst for the reason bitches buyin' these purses
The same reason that I just bought this kush, a nigga burnin'
She likin' my chain, givin' me brain, that bitch learnin', put her up on gang
But all these lives that I changed won't change me
Same cool nigga, same old Breezy
It's so amazin', I'm somethin' major, a thousand dollar tip for the waiter
And I can relate, you should get hella paid for manual labor
All the teachers and the police take a hell of a pay cuts
Society fucked up, I'm fucked up, when they gon' hurry up and wake up
Takin' me to the dark side, killin' me, feelin' like Darth Vader
Think the Lord gon' save you, if you was God, you hate us

[Chorus]
What they don't know, yeah, it's just the life of a young nigga
That's what they don't know, yeah, it's just the life of a young nigga
Roll up, alright, yeah, welcome to the life of a young nigga
I'm fucked up, this just the life of a
