[Verse 1: MoneyBagg Yo]
I'ma pull up in somethin' nasty just to hurt you bitches' feelings
White chalk, DOA, murder scene, cold blooded killing
Got a bad bitch and Gizzle, while I'm rollin' loud back to back
And they don't no smoke, just cough and choke, they high off contact
Hit the mall, to the max with it
No ranch dressing, all bleu cheese
Gettin' paper, no looseleaf
Taking selfies with the groupies
I'm just kicking shit, Bruce Lee
Artillery sitting on the front seat
Just finessed a man out of thirty P's
A B C, bitch I'm sellin' D
And I'm MoneyBagg, with two G's
Bill Gotti like two G's
Hoes lookin' like who is he
Diamonds fighting, looking like UFC
Real niggas always last, don't smoke 'round me if it ain't that gas
First night if I can't smash, you not my type ho, I'll pass

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
In the trap, catch me posted with them animals
When I'm in public they say I act like an animal
Pop a tab then I fuck her like an animal
I'm a young nigga, I got plenty stamina
In the trap, catch me posted with them animals
When I'm in public they say I act like an animal
Pop a tab then I fuck her like an animal
I'm a young nigga, I got plenty stamina

[Verse 2: Y Gizzle]
In the hood I'm Big Homie, you niggas some PeeWees
If I had a show on TV, you still couldn't see me
I'm everywhere you wanna go, fuckin' every bitch you wanna fuck
I'm in every hood you can't go in, I got my status up
Cop a whole pound and I break it down, weigh it and bag it up
I'm in the open, don't give a fuck
I'm tryna run me some money up
Do the same shit a hundred times
Then go cop me a Rover truck
Hit her good 'til she can't get enough
Lay her flat, toot her ass up
Fuck the bitch just like a savage
Then I pass her to my rachet
That's my homie, that's my ace
Pills and lean, man I'm laced
Drinkin' drank by the case
Spending money by the face
In my hood I'm an animal
Hannibal Lector like cannibal

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
In the trap, catch me posted with them animals
When I'm in public they say I act like an animal
Pop a tab then I fuck her like an animal
I'm a young nigga, I got plenty stamina
In the trap, catch me posted with them animals
When I'm in public they say I act like an animal
Pop a tab then I fuck her like an animal
I'm a young nigga, I got plenty stamina

[Verse 3: Fengshui]
Yeah, she say I'm a phantom yeah (she a fan)
Everything on her answer bruh (I'm the man)
They know I can bring it back
I'm a hard worker, I'm not on the step
Oh, I beat the street just like a fucking ape
I'm a super rapper, I need a damn cape
Your girl stuck to me, like some damn tape
Eat up on these niggas like it's my last plate
Animal, they'll handle you
Don't let that shit get too mechanical
Or you're out of luck
I'm really out here counting bucks
We gettin' mounted up

[Chorus: MoneyBagg Yo]
In the trap, catch me posted with them animals
When I'm in public they say I act like an animal
Pop a tab then I fuck her like an animal
I'm a young nigga, I got plenty stamina
In the trap, catch me posted with them animals
When I'm in public they say I act like an animal
Pop a tab then I fuck her like an animal
I'm a young nigga, I got plenty stamina
