[Intro]
Rubber bands, rubber bands
Rubber bands - BONG, BONG, BONG
Bands!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Look at these rubber bands
Bouncing left and right, up and down
Call my band right now, let 'em know it's going, DOWN
Look at these rubber bands [3X]

Bay-bay, pull her pants down
Try to  snatch that rubber band stacks
Fouling up my backpack, while I holla
"What's up Soulja?" Dolla popping, bet it throw it
Showing off the middle finger
Showing off the index ring
Yeah I know my index stink
Cheddar diamonds, yellow rings
It's Soulja Boy Tell 'Em man
And my chain and the friends
A shout out to the Mona Lisa hanging on my wall
In my crib right next to the rubber bands dawg
For real

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Look at these rubber bands
Bouncing left and right, up and down
Call my band right now, let 'em know it's going, DOWN
Look at these rubber bands [3X]

Bam! Hands down, I got swag for the year
Rubber bands on my neck, yellow ice in my ear
Make my grill disappear, when I smile in the sun
When you see the money game mayne, well you better run
Cause we snatch yo' chicks and take yo' trucks
Ain't no need to holla pot nah
Just pass me the rubber bands
And the rest'll follow shawty
Holla if you hear me homey, scream if you see me shawty
Be ready to scream, cause you about to see me shawty

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Look at these rubber bands
Bouncing left and right, up and down
Call my band right now, let 'em know it's going, DOWN
Look at these rubber bands [3X]

Walk inside the mall
Girls screaming cause I'm fresher than a doll
New yarns, different seasons
Boy I got a ball
I got a have it all, if I can't have the best
Then I don't want it all, this is how we boss
This is how we ball, pop tags then we do it boy
Shaking them haters off, see that do it do it fluid boy
Soulja Boy tell them yeah, tell them I'm the man
Yeah you can't get in my mansion unless you hold a grand

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Look at these rubber bands
Bouncing left and right, up and down
Call my band right now, let 'em know it's going, DOWN
Look at these rubber bands [3X]
