[Hook: Young Dolph]
Real niggas make the world go around
Real niggas make the world go around
Real niggas make the world go around
I say real niggas make the world go around

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
Welcome to the world of a dope boy
Grew up in the hood where my role model was the dope man
Lil' bad motherfucker, 9 years old smokin'
19 I wanted a plug, said fuck it, flew to Oakland
Now I'm gettin' money with my West Coast homies
7 p's of strong with the FN on me
While you laid up with that freak I'm out here in these streets
From South Memphis all the way up to South East DC
They say real niggas make the world go around
Might pull up on you and front you a hundred pounds
Swervin' in that foreign, almost lost control
Fuckin' with the plug got me out of control

[Hook x2:]

[Verse 2: Shy Glizzy]
I walk up in this pageant like a trap nigga
Young Jefe I'm different than these rap niggas
Facts nigga never piggy back niggas
If you don't keep ya strap ya might get jacked nigga
Shoutout to Paper Route, shout out to South Memphis
Fake nigga  keep yo ass in detention
Every time you see me bitch, I got my extension
This pussy niggas just want my attention
I remember I couldn't get an ounce
Now I just moved my momma in a bigger house
Bigger choppers under the bigger couch, rahh
I got bigger birds for a big amount

[Hook x2]
