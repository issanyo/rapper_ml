Ay, what's Haapnin'
All you haters, can get at me
Cause I hear ya, and I'm watching
But I'm serious
Haters, so all I got to say is, "What up"

What's haapnin'
All you haters, can get at me
Cause I hear ya, and am watching
But I'm still here, I ain't stoppin'
So what up

[Verse 1]
What it is bruh, What it do mane
Still the man from Japan to the blue flame
Still hit the door and make it rain with the loose change
I bet that what he get a show, now that's a damn shame
I guess that what he hatin' fo', boy you so damn lame
Your click the same, a just a bunch of walkin' shit stains
Disgrace the A, you give the city such a bad name
You're way back in my rear view mirror, I'm in the fast lane
But still I hear ya loud and clear on your lil' song
Go on get your dissing on while the king gone
Your self-esteem gone, cause I'm back now
Let's see if we can teach these niggas how to act now
You're kissing ass then, you jumping bad now
I check your ass then, I shut your ass down
And I deliver front and center never back down
Who get the last laugh now sucka nigga

[Verse 2]
I got a front street swag and a side street hustle
Center Hill, Cedar Ave. that's where I be sucka
South Grand Church Street, the first with the work
But we can get into commercial, if you need some, chirp me
Hey, what I care 'bout who you asking saying they ain't heard of me
I'm certified certainly your videos ain't hurting me
I still ride with the windows rolled down
All around the A-town
Like it's finna go down
If there was ever any questions niggas finna know now
Won't retire my throne, nor surrender no crown
I never bow down, and never say "bye"
Ms. "To whom it may concern" and whosoever may try
I'm forever west-side and the feather-weight guy
Tell 'em take they best shot
Go'on, get yourself high
Cause I yelled "Bankhead" and you felt left out
I ain't mentioned your name, is that what all this 'bout?

[Verse 3]
From Summer Hill to the hills up in Hollywood
A house full, getting to it, you know how we do it
Yea we smoke great, and we drink good
Then we ball hard, just like G's should
Buy what we want, drive what we want
G4 up up and away, we go, we fly where we want
Haters smile like they like it when they really don't
Wish they could just wish me away that what they really want
"I really hate his ass", "I don't like him either"
"We'll do a song together maybe then we can beat him"
Somehow he must be stopped, something must be done
"If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns"
"And if he really done, and we really won"
"Any more ideas, (I got some) suggestions anyone?"
"How 'bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites"
"Spread, vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write"
But that's all right, let the nerds hate
Cause in my face though, them words getin' ate
And hatin's hard work, when I just bounce back
This God work, tell all the haters I'm back!
