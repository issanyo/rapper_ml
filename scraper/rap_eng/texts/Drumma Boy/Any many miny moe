This that High Class Street Music
Street Music
(Intro)
This that High Class Street Music
Street Music
In it, ridin it
Trappin round empires

(Bridge)
Brown skin, fat ass, yea she just right
College diploma, yea she my type
I said girl where you been all of my life?
I got one question for you – Can you be my wife?

(Verse)
I’m just playin with shit, can you spend the night?
Yea I’mma beat it up and I promise to do it right
Call yo nigga, tell that pee wee have a nice life
If I fuck our promise then give me one chance to get it right
Tryna fall in that pussy and get stuck in it
I got 2 seater, we can fuck in it
Champagne, designer shoppin, that’s just the beginning
You so fine I don’t even wanna think that the ending
Good girl turned bad girl
Then she went to Dolph worrying, that’s where she got lost there
Any many miny moe
I found what I was lookin fo so I ain’t lookin no mo

(Hook)
Any many miny moe
I’m in the club drinkin, lookin for a good hoe
I mean a good girl, I mean a bad bitch
Excuse my French, I’m just a hood nigga that never had shit
Any many miny moe
I’m in the club drinkin, lookin for a good hoe
I mean a good girl, I mean a bad bitch
High class street nigga, I need a high class bitch

(Verse)
Lil mama bad as hell, I can’t even lie
Something about the way she smells, something about her eyes
Something about the way she walk, the way she ridin
I looked her in her eyes and said girl you fire
My last bitch was flat but this bitch is fly
It just might be the weed because I stay higher
If it is, fuck it, roll up another one big
I wonder if I can get er to bring one of her friends
Bottles in the club, me and Drumma Boy
Play with me, see how fast I fuck yo baby mama boy
I flood the city life, a water fountain dog
4 in the morning, dope money still countin dawg

(Bridge)
Straight look, no lie
Dolce & Gabana
Everything matching bow ties
Smoke nothing but OG
This that high class shit
This A+ bitch with me, that my high class bitch

(Hook)
Any many miny moe
I’m in the club drinkin, lookin for a good hoe
I mean a good girl, I mean a bad bitch
Excuse my French, I’m just a hood nigga that never had shit
Any many miny moe
I’m in the club drinkin, lookin for a good hoe
I mean a good girl, I mean a bad bitch
High class street nigga, I need a high class bitch
