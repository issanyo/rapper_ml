[Hook]
I got a lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
A lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
A lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
But I ain't gon' even lie, when I be out you cross my mind
Soon as I jump up out the building, I'm chasing dollar signs
But I ain't gon' even lie, bitch you make it on my time
On the road getting it, I'm in the air flyin'
And I be doing like this getting money was a crime

[Verse 1]
These squares kicked up burn strong reefer
On the road getting money with my boy Caesar
That's my dog and you know that
Might pull up in yo city, fresh as hell like where the hoes at?
I'm just playin, I ain't got time for em
All these hoes on my line, I don't even answer the phone for em
But I can't even lie, I've got this one girl on my mind
Man I gotta make her mine
But the only thing about it is that I can't make the time
I just looked down at my phone, she called me 24 times
Left me 12 voice mails and she sent me 8 texts
All she talkin about how bad she wanna have sloppy sex

[Hook]
I got a lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
A lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
A lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
But I ain't gon' even lie, when I be out you cross my mind
Soon as I jump up out the building, I'm chasing dollar signs
But I ain't gon' even lie, bitch you make it on my time
On the road getting it, I'm in the air flyin'
And I be doing like this getting money was a crime

[Verse 2]
Lil mama burn my phone up
I just burnt the zone up
I was smoking that strong stuff
Fake ass nigga, you can't clone us
That Gabana flyer than a butterly
Got my pack and that's supper time
It's time to eat dawg
Pull up on yo bitch and sweep her off her feet dawg
She on her back, ceiling fan hit her feet dawg
Told her when I get out the road I had her a treat, dawg
I've been on my motherfuckin grand
I fucked lil mama so good she likes her motherfuckin man

[Hook]
I got a lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
A lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
A lot of bitches on my line but I ain't got time
But I ain't gon' even lie, when I be out you cross my mind
Soon as I jump up out the building, I'm chasing dollar signs
But I ain't gon' even lie, bitch you make it on my time
On the road getting it, I'm in the air flyin'
And I be doing like this getting money was a crime
