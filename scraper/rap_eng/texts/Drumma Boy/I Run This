[Lil Wayne]
Uh-huh, yeah
Check me out
Look!

[Hook: Lil Wayne & (Birdman)]
(I run this bitch~!) And I'mma keep runnin
I'mma keep runnin but I'm never runnin outta money
I'mma dog, I'mma stunt, if I don't do nuttin
And my car so pretty all these hoes wanna fuck it
I got pussy wet paint, big boy shoes
Soft-ass seats and my trunk go boom
Got a black-ass gun and a bad yellow bitch
And it looks like I'mma die like this

[Verse 1: Birdman]
Cause we be stuntin' on these bitches, get money on these bitches
$250 on the wrist nigga we be the illest
We be the realest, CMB niggas
Uptown soldier with the money to the ceiling
Shinin like a diamond from a eagle to a pigeon
Birds on the wire hundred deep and we chillin
Finger on the trigger, that's that uptown livin'
High to the sky, no divin for fishes
Hustlin, doin donuts in the Lamb'
Candy on the slab, 50 on the ave
Hundred at the crib, get it how you live
Stuntin on these bitches, red diamonds how I feel

[Hook]
(I run this bitch~!) And I'mma keep runnin
I'mma keep runnin but I'm never runnin outta money
I'mma dog, I'mma stunt, if I don't do nuttin
And my car so pretty all these hoes wanna fuck it
I got pussy wet paint, big boy shoes
Soft-ass seats and my trunk go boom
Got a black-ass gun and a bad yellow bitch
And it looks like I'mma die like this

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hollygrove Gangsta, Eagle Street animal
I’ll have my goons Jack-son like Samuel
If ya want beef bring your cows, I will cattle you
Yeah, I see you, player, but I’m the most valuable
I am so radical; my Lamborgini got on a bikini
That mean it's topless, you've seen it on the beach
When I screech and swerve, keep tha purp, keep tha syrup
Know I be getting on people’s nerves, but people can kiss my bleepin burb
I’m first, second, third, tha-tha-that's my word
Cash Money, Young Money: tha-tha-tha-that’s who I’m gon be with
When you come for me
Every time, anytime, I’m gon' beat you at the finish line, cause...

[Hook: Lil Wayne & (Birdman)]
(I run this bitch~!) And I'mma keep runnin

Soft-ass seats and my trunk go boom

[Verse 3: Birdman]
I'm a uptown soldier, known high roller
Money go getter, M.O.B. all over
Hustlin with the birds, known to take it off your shoulder
Grindin with the homies, got the game out the 'Nola
Hundred G's wrapped, hood with a strap
Blowin on the dojo, nigga stuntin in a 'llac
Chicken in the oven, wall safe for the stack
Bought a brand new Range, and a brand new 'bach
Old school Caddy, fifth wheel, slab back
A brand new truck, a brand new bike
A brand new house, a brand new psych
A brand new bitch live a hood rich life
