[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Let's try some new
I'm with my niggas boy we wild like the fucking zoo
No favoritism you get it too
A fuck nigga I don't salute
Pull up we'll shoot
At you and all your troops
Who the fuck is you
Now a days man who is who
On the block man it get live
Fuck niggas man they gone lie
Steady talking man they ain't finna try us
Steady talking man they ain't finna try us?
It's around man you ain't gotta ask
Just pull up on a nigga we'll slide
I'm with the .50 lets ride
If it's --- we need all that

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Stop playing, you know me
Act like I'm the old me
Better act right like you owe me
Pull up shooting like I'm Curry
Put 'er out in a hurry
It could go down, we ain't worried
A lot of niggas be worried
Niggas scared shaking and nervous

[Hook: Lil Reese]
Let's try some new
Let's try some new
Let's try some new
Let's try some new
Let's try some new
