[Intro: Mr. Lif]
Check

[Verse 1]
Searching for adventure, welcome to dementia
Lif sent ya', every message that he meant ta'
Envision this, your perimeters are limitless
30,000 feet in the air, we're all there
Standard procedure, land them at Narita
Find reefer, hit the telly for some leisure
Relaxing, looking over Osaka
Thinking of a line for a rhyme that'll rock ya'
On stage shock ya', jetting cause I've gotta
Hit Tokyo with another dark and lonely flow
Language barrier like a carrier aircraft
When I move my physical frame, you'll hear math
Numbers crunch your bone well, struggle through your own hell
Pray you weren't alone when your dome fell, oh well
Go and grab another mop for the body shop
And while you rot, the dead'll get the fuck up and walk

[Chorus]
Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
Rock that ass to sleep with a beat then I'll chop you

Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
Once you're under spell, I'll do what the hell I want to

[Verse 2]
Let me lighten up, total eclipse, the universe flips
Sunken ships sink towards the sea's surface
A thousand tales of those who failed but kept composure
Decomposure, bloated from exposure
The sun bust, you better duck son, the government sonned us
To work toward needs and gun lust
We could buy our souls back, but we sold that
It's a no-go black, hire Scully and Kojak
Detectives with corrective lens perceptive
Tight perspective, yet missed the objective
Fuck it, live and let live, they could never catch Lif
Hit me with a beat and a mic, let's get biz
Lights dimming, that means your chances of escape slimming
Hands up and heads bobbing to the rhythm
Blood shower, now ya' body lose power
Within an hour I'll teleport to Kanazawa
To start my feeding again I'm peeling your skin
Then you scream, thus release the feelings within
Here's a flyer, missing my event would be a sin
Nigga showtime's at 9, welcome, let it begin

[Chorus]
Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
Rock that ass to sleep with a beat then I'll chop you

Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
Rock that ass to sleep with a beat then I'll chop you

Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
Rock that ass to sleep with a beat then I'll chop you

Strange things happen in the nighttime
When you leave your crib to come and hear a hype rhyme
At the show, so I've got you, black Nosferatu
Rock that ass to sleep with a beat then I'll chop you
