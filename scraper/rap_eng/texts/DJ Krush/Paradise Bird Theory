The end of the Century of Destruction
Various joys reflected at the commencement of the New Century
Dreams expanding, tell tales of future

Then appeared Gokuraku-cho, flying down
Black shadow gives a cold laugh

History of genocide repeated itself
Syas and does of egoists
Brainwashing by media
Blinded mass psychology
Even now, broken souls wander in the air

It might happen tomorrow
Impulse of distruction stems out of solitude and the air of catastrophe
Trusth of madness that lies behind smiles

Fading them out is unacceptable
Extinction of bodies, and murder of souls
Halt, look back, think
And proceed the Ended Century

What's waiting ahead is...
