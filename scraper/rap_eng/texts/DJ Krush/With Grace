Reason
Is there any reason
Why my heart must now understand
We had the fire so many times
Changes like the season
Convinces me
That we've come to an end
But your love was undescribable

Woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh
Woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh, woo ooh

And as I watch I see before my eyes
The truth is my reality
My emotions are high
And I'm at the risk of falling again
Right now everything's on the line

Being alone is not what I prefer
But I've got to face this feeling
With grace
I will step aside
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be round
Holler, holler, holler
Holler, holler, holler

Please don't try
To make me less than I am
Let's not drag it out anymore
With grace
I will gladly remove myself
With grace
I'm all too willing
'Cause being alone is not what I prefer
But I've got to face this feeling
With grace
I will step aside
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be round
With grace
I will step aside
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be round
Holler, holler, holler
Holler, holler, holler
With grace
I will step aside
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be round
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be round
But if you're in need
Holler and I'll be round
