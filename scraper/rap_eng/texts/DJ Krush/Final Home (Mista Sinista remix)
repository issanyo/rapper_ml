I traveled far to find you
Who knew you'd be so far away
I will stay now
Love
This weary heart
The only gift I bring you
This love I give to you
It won't stray
I could give you
The most delicious kisses on your face
You see I need you to be addicted to me
I am calm now in the corners of his mouth
I am still now, I will not live without
I am pure now, safe inside my final home
I could give you
The most delicious kisses on your face
You see I need you to be addicted to me
I am calm now in the corners of his mouth
I am still now, I will not live without
I am pure now, safe inside my final home
My home.. my home....
My home inside you
Safe inside my final home
My home inside you
