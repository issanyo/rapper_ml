Well, we know where we're goin'
But we don't know where we've been
And we know what we're knowin'
But we can't say what we've seenAnd we're not little children
And we know what we want
And the future is certain
Give us time to work it outWe're on a road to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that rideI'm feelin' okay this mornin'
And you know
We're on a road to paradise
Here we go, here we goWe're on a ride to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that rideMaybe you wonder where you are
I don't care
Here is where time is on our side
Take you there, take you thereWe're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhereThere's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby it's all rightAnd it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby it's all rightWould you like to come along?
And you could help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby it's all rightThey can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby it's all rightThere's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby it's all rightAnd it's very far away
But it's growing day by day
And it's all right, baby it's all rightWould you like to come along?
You could help me sing this song
And it's all right, baby it's all rightThey can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby it's all rightWe're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
We're on a road to nowhere
