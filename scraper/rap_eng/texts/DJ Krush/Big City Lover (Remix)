Cruisin' up and down this avenue
Baby, don't you know my eye's on you
Hiding in your shadow, gaze is kinda hollow
I just like your smile and your hair, it's really wild

Big city lover, I'll take a chance on you
Big city lover, but I think I like your groove
Big city lover, just keep that attitude

Didn't take too long to get you home
Just to find your heart was made of stone
Drowning in my sorrow, love don't like to furrow
Never thought you'd leave my feelings on the floor

Big city lover, I don't want to hear your lies
Big city lover, don't think I sympathize
Big city lover, you know I don't like to cry

Big city lover, you know I changed my mind
Big city lover, I thought that you were kind
Big city lover, now I just ain't got the time

Big city lover, I don't want to hear your lies
Big city lover, don't think I sympathize, no no no

Cruisin' up and down this avenue
Honey, don't you know my eye's on you

Big city lover, hell just might take a chance on you
Big city lover, I think I kinda like your groove
Big city lover, just lose that attitude
