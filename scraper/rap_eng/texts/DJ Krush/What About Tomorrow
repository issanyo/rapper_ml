It's so hard to see what's happening today
To see my brothers and sister die that way
I would like to take a trip to the palace of the king
Just to share what's on my mind for a brighter day

So much division on the walls of religiosity
So much confusions that we cannot see
Ole fascism gains poverty
No more bombing, no more shooting, let the children be

The pain is so hard that we can't feel it
So let my people free
How many cry, how many die, we see
Let JAH children be

Change hatred for a brighter tomorrow
Just to see the peace among each other
There's no war love can't conquer
We should all be our brother's keeper
