Cruisin' up and down
This avenue
Baby don't you know
My eye's on you
Hiding in your shadow
Gaze is kinda hollow
I just like your smile
Your hair is really wild

Big city lover
I take a chance on you
Big city lover
But I think I like your groove
Big city lover
Just keep that attitude

Didn't take too long
To get you home
Just to find your heart
Was made of stone
Drowning in my sorrow
Love don't like to furrow
Never thought you'd leave
My feelings on the floor

Big city lover
I don't want to hear your lies
Big city lover
Don't think I sympathize
Big city lover
You know I don't like to cry
Big city lover
You know - I changed my mind
Big city lover
I thought that you were kind
Big city lover
Now I just aint got the time

Big city lover
I don't want to hear your lies
Big city lover
Don't think I sympathize oh-no-no

Cruisin' up and down
This avenue
Honey don't you know
My eye's on you

Big city lover
Hell just might take a chance on you
Big city lover
I think I kinda like your groove
Big city lover
Just lose that attitude
