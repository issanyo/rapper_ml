Night comes around and I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down, blindin' every hope I had
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drives me mad
Love, love, love, love, this misery is just too much for me
Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather, since my girl and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather, I just can't get my poor self together
So weary all the time, all the time
Since he went away, all the blues walked in and met me
If she stays away, old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray that the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more
Can't go on, everything I had is gone
Stormy weather, since my girl and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, all the time
Keeps raining all the time
Can't go on, everything I had is gone, stormy weather
Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time, all the time
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time
Night comes around and I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down, blindin' every hope I had
