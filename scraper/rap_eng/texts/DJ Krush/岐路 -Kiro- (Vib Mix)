The Drums - The Future
LRC by lzh, from jiangxi pingxiang

Here I go again
Getting upset over nothing
Getting upset over your heart
Over your heart
And if I ruled the world
I would make every country salute you
I'd make you be mine
And I'm always in your cage
Set me free
And you've locked me in your cage
Here you go again
Walking away like it's nothing
Walking away from my heart
But I see your eyes at night
And you know what's wrong
And you know what's right
The future
