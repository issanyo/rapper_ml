If love is a danger, should we avoid it?
If love is a danger, should we avoid it?

It was a rainy day today
Sky stayed grey
A lonely day, lonely day
It will be a lovely night
Sunshine in my heart
Even when we are apart

(The danger of love) Drive me crazy
(The danger of love) Drives me easy
(The danger of love) Makes the power of your day
(The danger of love) Makes the power of your way
The danger of love...

Your love bring the sun in me
I could smell your essence
With or without your presence
It was a lovely day
A lovely day
A lovely daaay
A lovely daaaaaay ehhh
(the danger of love)
Drive crazy (the danger of love)
Drive me insane (the danger of love)
Makes the power (the danger of love)
Power of our day (the danger of love)
Makes the power (the danger of love)
Power of your way (the danger of love)
(the danger of love)
(the danger of love)
Lovely day
Lovely day

It was a rainy day
Sky stayed grey
They don't know nothing about love
Sunshine in me to stay
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dreeeeeeeam (the danger of love)

The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love
The danger of love

Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
Good night!, sleep tight! (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
See you in my dream tonight (the danger of love)
Tonight
Tonight see you in my dream
See you in my dream
