[Chorus: Celicia Ward]
If you only knew
(If you only knew)
How i wanna be down with you
How i want to be down


[Verse 1: Fat Pat]
You could be my baby baby if you keep it real
One love for a thug let me tell you how i feel
So real when i hold your body close to mine
Every time i'm with ya' man i swear its going down
Smelling sweet like roses and i suppose that you are the one that i have chosen not proposing
But i wanna' get in ya' take you away like Calgon your mind in a splendor
Do you remember the first time we made love heart pumping so fast as we push and we shove
I can see it in your eyes you have feelings for me baby but the situation crazy because i got a lady
Don't get me wrong because i love to get with ya
Hit me on the down low on the page come getcha' Ill be there in a sec
Go get a room and let's wreck
Lay back and hit it again
One more time and lets jet
Don't let nobody knock this thing that we got
Like them brawds in the beauty shop talking a lot they want what ya' got
It ain't no doubt about that passing they number winkin' they eyes at this player Fat Pat
I told you that you can't speak your hand cause that capping and that bragging make them want yo man
Do what i can and when i got the time if you love me like ya say baby you will stay down
(Can you feel me)


[Chorus: Celicia Ward]
If you only knew
(If you only knew)
How i wanna be down with you
(How i want to be down)
If you only knew
(If you only knew)
How i wanna be down with you
(How i wanna to be down)


[Verse 2:Fat Pat]
Low key place we meet you never been before adding spice to your life feelings can't ignore
Mind soars through the clouds sometimes its hard to see who i love the most my gal or my late night creep
Confused at times but i gotta go home talking to you on my celly till i turn on my corner
I can't get enough of this player life i wish there was some kind of way i could make you both my wife
Sleep with the both at night without a fuss or fight
Ménage à trois all the way to the middle of the night it feels so right to have you both on my side
I couldn't imagine my life without my brawd and my wife
(Its going down)


[Chorus: Celicia Ward]
If you only knew
How i wanna be down with you
(You'll never know)
If you only knew
(How i want to be down)
How i want to be down with you
(How i want to be down)



[Verse 3: Fat Pat]
I feel the pain you feel when you call me and cry
I'm just a player though ain't no way i can deny
No matter how hard i try to keep it real baby girl its the dog in me that keeps the spark up in your world
Your homegirls tell you to leave me but they just don't understand how serious the love between you and your man
That's why i'm down with you no matter what you do because you always stay true and you call me boo
The whip appears on you now what we gon' do in this long term thing
No more bumping and grinding you scream my name
I ain't the one to blame you couldn't keep your cool before you lose control know what you wanna do
Cause there ain't no turning back when the doors is closed
Meet a new brawd same thing happens once more
I'm just a playa' and that's all it is
Big pimpin' showing skills just keeping it real


[Chorus: Celicia Ward]
If you only knew
(and if you only knew)
How i want to be down with you
(How i wanna be down)
If you only knew
(If you only)
How i want to be down with you
(Be Down)
Only knew
(If i could tell you)
How i want to be down with you
If you only knew
(How i wanna be down)
How i want to be down with you
(How i want to be down)
