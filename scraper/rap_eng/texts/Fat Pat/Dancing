[Verse 1]
Seems like ages ago
I know the sweetness of your soul
Of your soul, of your soul
I am lost in this black hole
The time I am not in the physical world
It's with you
I'm addicted to this vertigo

[Chorus]
We're dancing on the edge
Of eternity
You got me hanging from the ledge
Only God can save me

[Verse 2]
De paula go to Lolla
Ball like Andre Iguodala
Nada in my cranium
In my pocket just a dollar
Not a single other woman in my heart so perpetual
Sevenfold girls this year on my testicles
Your the only one whose presence I wake up to
Making moves ain't a thing I do when I'm asleep with you
What is eternity, the absence of time?
Or you lost in my arms without a single thought to find?

[Chorus]
We're dancing on the edge
Of eternity
You got me hanging from the ledge
Only God can save me

[Verse 3]
Where the girls with the gloves at?
Where the girls with the hugs at?
I don't see em
I don't believe em cause the way they let you treat em
Then you wonder why my wall is always up like Liam
Carpe diem with a side cuz your other dude
Learned the hard way not to let the heart split in two
No seconds pass without you all up in my mind
Guess we'll talk
Guess we'll kiss
Guess we'll fuck another time

[Chorus]
We're dancing on the edge
Of eternity
You got me hanging from the ledge
Only God can save me
