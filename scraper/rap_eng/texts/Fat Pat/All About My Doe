I'ma stay in Southpark
Stayin down with the herd
Stayin down with the cattle
I shake, then I rattle
I might just come through
It's all about that grain
Might be all what on ya lesson
Teachin I might be stressin
I gots to come through to
Young G's I be stressin
17, Promethazine, creases in my jean
Pimpin', 6 screens
I'm comin through wreckin mic
Toting the weed I'm showin dope fiends
I ain't got time for pointing no red dot
I'm just bustin'
I ain't got time for no caps
I ain't sipping no Robitussin
We sipping that barre
TV/VCR, we renting that car no destination
We come thru on incarceration
I'm fresh off playing Playstation
In the what hoo-doo
I ain't sellin' no Zulu
I might just pop trunk now these
Hoes they doin' Voodoo
They wanna try to stick me
The foes want for 60
I'm might just come back
With Poyo instead of 50
Key-C is gonna shine
That boy Shaun reclined
I hit the Long Drive now it's time I do mine
It's time I just chill and lay back and sip a 8
I'm sittin' sideway
TV on tha scrape plate
They don't hate when they see
We coming, we don't fuss
We don't even cuss
We swanga's on the bus: Damn!
