[Intro]
Yuh
You gotta feel this (that's right)
Nahm sayin'
You make enemies, turn your back on a playa (huh)
What's up Blunty

[Hook: Fat Pat]
Friends we know done turned enemies
Because we stacking big paper collecting our cheese
We just some G's on a mission nah we ain't trippin'
Always packin' pistols, can't never be slippin' because
Friends we know done turned enemies
Because we stacking big paper collecting our cheese
We just some G's on a mission nah we ain't trippin'
Always packin' pistols, can't never be slippin'

[Verse 1: Fat Pat]
I got my hand on my gun, cuz you got me on the run
Blazin' hot like the sun, Nigga I ain't the one
You betta ask somebody 'bout PAT
Hard hittin' never quittin' breaking of a big piece
Blowing on swisher sweets, ridin' in leather seats
Raking H-Town streets, always packin' my heat
I thought you was my dog, plotted for my downfall
Because my paper was tall, back against the wall
Coming out striking like lightning, nigga me and CB
Two trill ass playas that you really can't see
But you wanna be, can't fill our shoes
Strings tied too tight, 'bout to give you the blues
See your face on the news, for that drama you choose
Don't break ghetto rules and turn your back on your fools
That's the way that you loose, so survive in the game
Keep your pistol always to you side 'fore you get a stain

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Blunt]
Friends we know done turned enemies
Because the jealousy, the hate trip, and the greed
They smile in your face, they talk behind your back
To bring you down they try their hardest never will they slack
Paper stacking, contracting, is a dot on your head
Fucking with a real playa you be left for dead
Up against all odds and niggas turning to broads
I keep my distance far away, never be involved
G's up, hoes down, hater's faces frown
Red benz pulled up and the eyes be round
True partners in crime done turned partners in rhyme
S U to the city be known for putting it down and uh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fat Pat]
Can't be slippin' out here ain't no time for that
Since the age of thirteen always had a gat
Who had my back when my money attract
Niggas who hung around like flies and gnats
Fat Pat on the map and that shits for sure
Dropping bombs like Outbreak when I hit the door
I'm a freestyle pro just to let y'all know
Breaking mics like psych, nigga we gotta go
My sound beats slow when I'm in your trunk
Bonafide big balla nah I ain't no punk
Hot slugs what they getting when a grudge is mentioned
Fast chasing, time facing, all snitches erasing
Intimidation, hesitation, lets me know that they fakin'
Hook some ? from these niggas who done say they be hatin'
? see a nigga fall, watch a nigga ball
Twenty four years in this game, niggas mashing on y'all
