Let's call up on drank

[Mike D]
Let's, call up on drank
Let me see, uh, my paper stack my bank
In my pocket, can't let you hock it, oh no
Cus I'm the crazy nigga by the name of Mike Doe
I did a murder with no traces
Still got the Versace's on my faces
Moved from gallons to cases
And now them hoes can't stand me
Nigga comin' down on the blades and I'm handlin' the wood
And it's understood, niggas all good
And in the southside, wreckin' shop just like you wish you could
North come up short when they come this way
Cus I hold up my tech, represent the tre'
And let 'em know that I'm down like the ground that you walk on
Niggas can press on cus I got me fucked up
Homies got the tommy gun handy
Hollering at my niggas out there, uh, lookin' dandy
And let's call up on drank
Me and my nigga P-A-T drinkin' by the bank
In the nine-six
Jumpin' in the mix
A young ass nigga just tryna turn a trick

[Fat Pat]
Let's call up on drank
Let's lean nigga
Let's lean nigga
I said, let's call up on drank
Let's lean nigga
Let's lean nigga

[Fat Pat]
Shit, for life, that's me, P-A-T
Nigga always drank the codeine
Always wanna lean
Blow a big bitch square up in the air
Bend the bourbon, comin' down swervin'
Got the pot, got a lot of cash
We goin' to buy an eight (?)
I can't think
I'm gone off the dank
I love drank so what they talkin' bout
I'm from the south, I got the diamond in my mouth
And my game, I spit the way when I'm on the lean
In the club, in the bitch ear now she's gonna fiend
Take her to the bed, you know the story
The flaming glory
Don't ever worry
Fat Pat is gonna hurry
And break the boys off
From the fucking north
I'm really from the south
So what they talkin' bout?
You know how I do it
Break it down, smoke a pound
Surround my sound, broke it down
Now I'm going to wood climb(?)
I'm droppin the top
We gon' call up on drank
I got a bank so what the fuck you think
And I'mma let you ride
And I'mma let you slide
Before I let you go
Because I'mma tell you now

[Fat Pat]
Let's call up on drank
Well let's lean on it
Well let's lean on it
Well, let's call up on drank
Let's lean nigga
Let's lean nigga

[DJ Screw]
Know what I'm saying?
Let's call up on drank
It ain't too late, it's just seven in the mornin'
We still here goin live
South side staying real
You know we still calling up
Drop Botany, all day and every day

[Fat Pat]
Pourin' drank
Let's call up on drank
Yeah I got mine
It's goin' down
Smooth

...On drank... let's lean... let's lean...
