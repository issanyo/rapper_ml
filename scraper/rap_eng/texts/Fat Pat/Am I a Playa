Am I a playa
Am I a playa
Playing these hoes like they was Sega
Am I a playa
Am I a playa
Playing these hoes
Am I a playa

[Verse 1]
Playing these hoes like they was Sega
Running me down like I had pledged with Omega
I'll take her, take her to the bedroom and break her
Off something proper cause they call me big poppa
When I knock her from the coach to the bed
Shooting nut all in her hair
Your game is dead so stop frontin'
Frontin' like you the bitch of the month
You ain't nothing and take that how you wanna
And call it how you see it
Only when I call are you needed
You show me good thangs, good thangs, good thangs

[Hook]
Am I a playa (I heard about you)
Am I a playa
Am I a playa
Am I a playa
Playing these hoes like they was Sega
Am I a playa (yeah)
Am I a playa
Playing these hoes

[Verse 2]
Big boss, big ballin' playa
Super ho layer, mack line sayer
Yellow and long hair screaming hi sugar daddy
If u come home with me you can have me
Am I a playa that is the question
Peep game, learn thangs, as I floss on hoes
I stand in pimp lines, be the first to be chose
? walking for this pimp like a pimp mind gone
Whatever P-A-T say is do or die no lie
My my my game never shy mister mister mister (uh)
Am I a playa am I a playa (uh)
Am I a playa
By now you should know the deal
Bonafide playa keep it on the real
Game switching gears like a 57' Chevy
If you ain't a real playa then you ain't ready
It's all copa steady game like unleaded
Flowing by the mile reppin til you broad like a freestyle
G style is what I display when I parley
The pimp sugar daddy is all in your face
Taking hoes, slamming doors ?
My wardrobe is so ?
Cross mode is what I'm in
Spit my game now we all in the winds
Riding off cozy, in the benz
9 8 headlights, blue lens
Croc skin interior, I'm sitting low
On twenty inch Lorenzo
With my AMG kit, I'm the shit
My screens lit, 'bout to fuck your bitch

Am I a playa
Am I a playa
Am I a playa
Playing these hoes like they was Sega
Am I a playa (yeah)
Am I a playa
Playing these hoes
