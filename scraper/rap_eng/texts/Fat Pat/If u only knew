Paroles de la chanson If You Only Knew :

[Refrain:]
If you only knew (if you only knew) how I wanna be down with you how I want to be down with you

You can be my baby baby if you keep it real One love for a thug let me tell you how I feel
So real when I hold your body close to mine Every time I'm with you man I swear it's goin down
Smelling sweet like roses and I suppose that you are the one that I have chosen Not proposin but I wanna get in ya take ya away like [? ] on [? ]
Do you remember the first time we made love heart pumpin so fast as we push and we shove
I can see it ya eyes ya had feelings for me baby but the situation's crazy because I got a lady Don't get me wrong because I love to get with you Hit me on the down low on the page come get'cha I be there in a sec Go get a room and let's wreck. Lay back and hit it again One mo time and let's jet
Don't let nobody knock this thing that we got Like the broads in the beauty shop talkin a lot they want what you got It ain't no doubt about that As they [? ] winkin they eyes at this player Fat Pat
I told you that you can't speak ya hand cause that cappin and the braggin make em want yo man
I do what I can and when I gots the time if you love me like you say baby you will stay down Can you feel me?

[Refrain:]
Oooooh, if you only knew If you only knew how I wanna be down with you how I want to be down If you only knew, If you only knew how I wanna be down with you How I wanna be down

We'll be places we meet you never been before addin spice to ya life feelings can't ignore
Mind soar through the clouds sometime it's hard to see who I love the most, my gal or my late night creep Confused at times but I gotta go home talkin to you on my celly til I turn on my corner I can't get enough of this player life I wish it was some kind of way I make you both my wife sleep with the both at night without a fuss or fight M
