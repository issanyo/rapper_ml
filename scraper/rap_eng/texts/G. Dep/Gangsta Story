He was only 15 and known for the goodies
While others sported gucci he sported hoodies
And Levis wit a 9 on his side
To make for what he lacked in size
Already had a spot in organize crime
Got his first body at the age of 9
Gloomy expression but his boys called him sunny
By 12 sunny was rollin' in money
Clockin' G's just for pullin' a trigger
His pistol smoked his rep got bigger and bigger
Ya see the way sunny was brought up
Was the reason that Sunny got caught up
In a life for crime but that's another story
A different subject a whole different category
It's present day and Sunny runs his own spot
Only 15 and a got a fat knot
Lover the dollar, to him the dollar means glory
He doesn't know yet
He's just another gansta story

Time goes by now Sunny's rockin' jewels and games
Runnin' 7 spots he's got the projects hemmed
He's gettin' paid but stills Sunny wants more
Crack on the corner and weed out bodega store
Workers workin' hard While Sunny sits back
Livin' cozy and Sunny starts to nap
He's very young and livin' what others dream
And while he's sleeps his workers start to scheme
On a way to get what Sunny has
He doesn't realize too busy talkin' all that jazz
Of how he's livin' like a star on the big screen
If Sunny sleeps too long he won't see 17
`Cause while he troops through his territory
His brothers scheme but yo
Thats just another gansta story

Nighttime falls and now's the time
Here's the plan give Sunny a call at 9
Tell him to meet you at the the spot you need to re up
And when he rools he's gonna get stuck
Call is made and Sunny takes the bait
What happen next We'll leave it up to fate
One man watches the tube the others clean his gat
Counting their chickens before they even Hatch
1 o'clock rolls and there's the knock
Only sound ya hear is pistols cock
Before they open the door, the door gets blown
Sunny's caught on and didn't come along
His posse rushes the house in a blaze of glory
A routine scene
It's just another gansta story

The job is done and two men lie there dead
Sunny feels strong his hunger's now been fed
He's feeling big and stays to give himself props
And while he's in the house somebody call the cops
Police roll-- in seconds flat
Well awere of where the house was at
They used to roll there on a regular basis
Upstairs they look on their faces
Is hard and cold they know what they're in for
Load the guns we're going out the front door
One last breath and Sunny pull his 9
Grin on grill and now's the time
Can't give up Sunny in it too deep
Nobody talks `cause talk is cheap
The posse is ready to rush out the door
So make room at the city morgue
Bodies fall I count about 5
Bullets fly and Sunny's still alive
And out of ammo so Sunny tries to run
But gets caught in the back by a cop's gun
Sunny dies in his territory
A sad scene but yo
That's just another gansta story
