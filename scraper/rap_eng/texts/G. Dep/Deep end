“verse one”

Show em no mercy

Half evil

Both in my ear like keep workin

This shit hot buh still furnished

Watch how i

Polish off the rest of the niggas in my way

Pocket every check

We ain’t gon take shit to the bank

Hide it under the mattress

Even what I made today

Got my uncle celebrating in his grave

You know how we coming

Dont think you runnin we gon catch up any way

It’s my time no flav

Keep my wife in the late

Soon w a baby otw

Deep into this music

Im moving abruptly

Weather up a storm

Jus unexpected quest

Please do be alarmed

Qoute on every word i spit

Tell em im like a bomb

& i ain't even rich yet

Tryna make sure money long

Africans w gold around they necks

Tryna ball like I got scholarships involved

Proper preparation otherwise you left off board

We trying to eat good at what we had wasn’t enough

Fightin for more the hunger they take me trying to get buff

All nikes no russ

No mikes all scuffed

My type get money smoke woods

Ill cuff

Ass fat it sure jiggle every time the girl strut

Pussy good mhm she gon catch a couple nuts

“chorus”

Shit get to lookin ugly

I still call a pretty pic

Cus we ain't come from nothin

Buh was raised to ball or flip

Made some waves involved no fish

I jus pave until im rich

You quick to shave the point i made i across

You aimed & it ain't hit

“verse 2 “

Mind on the growth

Gross

Bigger house a lake & a boat

Leave em stoked

This shit my surprise from leaving broke

Lord knows I fucked shit up

Now I'm paying whats been owed

Momma tell us fake shit is what fake niggas expose

Realize they ain't what they really told

When I've O double o since the day a nigga
Woke

These talk a lot buh ain't about all of they shit they wrote

When I got niggas down fr

& they cut up ya hopes

All we see win in the vision

The tunnel pointing thru

Chasing chicken

Cus kiccin it we ain't boutta do

I'm on a high altitude

No point in sitting round you dudes

We cut in lines no Jason

Shot our shots buh doing more than shoot


So far I stuck to what I live by

Hershcel when I walk thru

More dead than George & Jefferson

& hittas that'll all sharp shoot

Dream of when I wake up

I see views like the skys my walk room

Some friends turned to a walk by

Act like I don't know you

Heart cold like a frost bite

No love they all hoes too

Whole crew gon eat

Dinner made for everyone who

Ain't turn they back to stab me

Circle small a magnify used

Quick to switch shit up

I keep my gaurd on bigger made moves

We came from ebt cards to money diamonds no fast food

This ragu to much for you

A couple chains swang like im texas proof

Yellin west side like im pac & snoop
