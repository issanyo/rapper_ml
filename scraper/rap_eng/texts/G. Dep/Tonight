[Hook: G]
Baby let me be your music
I'll teach you how to move yo body
You know that you want to do it
And we don't have to tell nobody
Baby let me be your music
I'll teach you how to move yo body
You know that you want to do it
And we don't have to tell nobody

[Verse 1: Cutless]
Girl don't Tell nobody
And I can tell yo body wants nobody but my body
(Tonight)
Girl don't Tell nobody
And I can tell yo body wants nobody but my body
(Tonight)
If you do it like a champ then you mocking me
I'm moving to fast so now you clockin me
Its been along time since you've been rockin wit me
Its been along time since I've been rockin des beats
You've been all on my mind when I've been walkin the streets
I've been all on my grind to have you talkin to me
You've been all on my mind like you stalkin me
And all them other B****** I got off of me
You wanted a man so I offered me
LOVE NEVER EVER REALLY COST FOR ME!

Cuz all dat sh** just false to me
This right here between me and you
You gotta man I'm between you too
It seems yo man between us too
You don't give a damn well it seems you do
(Tonight)
