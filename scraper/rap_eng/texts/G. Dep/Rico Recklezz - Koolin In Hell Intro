I used to sell drugs, that really wasn't my thing
Then I started robbing like I hang with Batman,
I'm just a nigga with a dream, Martin Luther King
My first time shooting somebody I was seventeen
I upped it, he ain't give it up, what the fuck do you mean?
I left his ass red, cause I'm in love with that green
Its a iron dot, but it ain't no "i" in team
So that should let you know I'm down to do bout anything
Fuck the bench coach put a nigga in the game
With the heat I get them rings, Lebron Reckless James
I was so reckless that the street niggas made that my name
I'm menace to society leave you bloody like Kane
If you ain't with the shits, then yo ass shouldn't have came
Robbing gone bad, I was the first one they blamed
My homie told on me didn't know he could be that lame
Couldn't even look me in my face, hold his head down in shame, locked up for a minute now I'm back in the hood
Niggas smiling in my face like everything is good
Ain't no need to explain what should be understood
Smoked his ass you could find him somewhere in the woods
That's when I realized, can't have no heart for these niggas
Cat fishes, I'm a motherfucking shark to these niggas
That's when I realized, can't have no heart for these niggas
These niggas bitches, I'm a motherfucking shark to these niggas. Into it with everybody, niggas done shot up my crib
They shot my sister in the arm, but she still lived
I grabbed that 30 & box of shells with no fucks to give
And started passing out smoke like a barbecue grill
A lot of bodies dropping, niggas know what it is
Rico motherfuckin' Recklezz, I'm gone handle biz
Like a Christmas present i was known for wrapping shit
Who would've thought that now, I'd be doing this rapping shit?
