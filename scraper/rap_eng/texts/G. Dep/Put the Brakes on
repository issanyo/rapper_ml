Life is moving too quick
Put the brakes on
Put the brakes on
I promise it won't take long
Put the brakes on

Let me get my groove on
Everybody's so quick tryna move on
Me included
And all this alcohol's got my thoughts diluted
What's your name again?
I forgot
I'll try to remember but I'd rather not
Honestly doesn't matter as long as you kill my thoughts
I'm sorry I'm not
Here to stay for long
I know you wanna be more than just a line in a song
But the feeling is wrong
So I guess I'll just keep on
Moving on

It feels like good times never last
While you have the chance
Put the brakes on
I know life's moving too fast
Put the brakes on
Put the brakes on
I promise it won't take long
Put the brakes on
Put the brakes on

Take a look around truth is
Everybody's tryna grow up too quick
Take the time to slow down
Or you might miss out
Everything that's not a blessing
Serves as a lesson
Pay attention or you might miss the message
You're meant to receive
And I do believe
Everything happens for a reason
But I wanna slow time just to stop the bleeding
Go back in time stop you from leaving

Feels like good times never last
While you have the chance
Put the brakes on
I know life's moving too fast
Put the brakes on
Put the brakes on
I promise it won't take long
Put the brakes on
Put the brakes on

Take me back home as a kid
Only worry in the world which toy to pick
Take me back before I knew what a check was
Before I knew what death was
All I'm saying is
Past is the past can't change it
So before the memories you make are gone
Take the time to put the brakes on
