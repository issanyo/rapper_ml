[Verse One: G, The Wiz]
Yeah, I’ve been here way too long
I got a dream but I feel lost
Nothing feels like it can go wrong
Sitting here all by myself
Had enough of failed attempts
Never once did I play pretend
Since the age of ten
Been writing with my pen
I’m losing faith every other weekend
They keep saying that I need some help
Yeah but, they don’t know me
Never see me, never hear me
When I’m living out my life
Do you feel me never fear me
And when I’m gone out of town
You can miss me, you can call me
But remember you were never around
I’m on my own booking shows
Making music from my room
No one told me what to do
I knew I had too

[Hook: G, The Wiz]
I’m on a road trying to escape
I’m go and go and go and go
Where no one else goes
I'm on a road trying to escape
From this world, this world, this world
That doesn’t know me
And when I make it big, when I make it big
Remember all the times you said it wasn’t happening
I’m on a road trying to escape
I’m go and go and go and go
Where no one else goes

[Verse Two: G, The Wiz]
I’ve given up on sleeping
Napping on city buses
People who put me down
For no certain reason
She had too much too drink
I’ve had too much too think
About my life ahead;
Before I’m dead and gone
I know I’ve done a lot things wrong
Just know I want you to be proud of me dear mom
As a son and as an artist, i’ll make it happen
When I dream there are no limits.  Letting go of my bad habits
Sent from heaven with no feathers
Just laced with all these talents
When I write it and record it
Produced and when I release it
I hope the world will love it
It’s who I am, where i’ve been
Where i’m going, where i’ll be
This year, next year
There’s just not knowing
But I’m still growing
On a whim
On a chance
I’m still keep working. Still keep grinding
9-5’s aren’t my motive
Keep on walking Keep on going
Life is short. This is race is long
Paint that picture. Write the song
Shake this planet with your talent
Because the last thing that you want
Is regretting for not doing those things all along

[Hook: G, The Wiz]
I’m on a road trying to escape
I’m go and go and go and go
Where no one else goes
I'm on a road trying to escape
From this world, this world, this world
That doesn’t know me
And when I make it big, when I make it big
Remember all the times you said it wasn’t happening
I’m on a road trying to escape
I’m go and go and go and go
Where no one else goes

[Hook: G, The Wiz]
I’m on a road trying to escape
I’m go and go and go and go
Where no one else goes
I'm on a road trying to escape
From this world, this world, this world
That doesn’t know me
And when I make it big, when I make it big
Remember all the times you said it wasn’t happening
I’m on a road trying to escape
I’m go and go and go and go
Where no one else goes
