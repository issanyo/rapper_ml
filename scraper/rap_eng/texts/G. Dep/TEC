[Intro: TEC]:
Been flying so high, I don't want to come down
But something seems off we about to touchdown
I never would've thought, that all of this would happen
Mayday, Mayday, there's been a crash landing

[Verse 1: TEC]:
I thought I made it, feels like overtime I try I'm jaded
There was a time where if everyone was high, I'd fake it
Cuz I was better, I wallowed in self righteousness
Hey, this was me, knew for a fact that I was heaven sent
Then it came to pride and lies, causing my mind to wander
I made what's wrong, look like truth now my life was laundered
See now the fall, was more than just imminent, I was just tryna make the fake me relevant
So here we are my vision still blurred from the wreckage
Disaster came, and I have no idea what did it
Wasn't me, at least at first I thought it wasn't
But with lies piled up, it was cheaper by the dozen
I don't know, if he came, to save the real me
I couldn't believe it, cuz I lived my life unclean
Pointing out the speck in everybody else's lives
It's been a while since I've looked into my own eyes
What do I do when this destruction, just needs to be restored
I need a weapon this war really needs a sharper sword
I snap back to reality where God reigns supreme
And now I rise from the ashes, my life has been redeemed

[Verse 2: G]:
I been flying on this plane for a mighty long time
And I don't think there's any time of me ever looking behind
All success by my design, young cat in his prime
Everything's going fine, making moves tryna climb
To higher peaks, what altitudes can I reach?
Pulling maneuvers, pay no mind to the safety belt attached to my seat
To my perceived destruction I suffer the crash landing
But because of the grace of God, something still remaining standing
The word of God is like a sword to your pride's bungee chord
When reality's ignored, weaknesses become explored
I don't think we can afford to not be restored
The prodig's nation's taking off and they screaming "all aboard"
What's it for? When you hear disaster knocking at your door
For you to receive the reward of when your soul and your flesh are evenly scored
I point to the Lord, who came to save humanity from the coming calamity
Renewed mentality got me talking like I'm on the brink of insanity
But I don't walk with fear, cuz I know that the time is near
When the glory of Jesus melts away every layer in the atmosphere
I don't always see it clear, bad weather clouding my vision
But as long as I got the light on my side I'm in the perfect position, like...
