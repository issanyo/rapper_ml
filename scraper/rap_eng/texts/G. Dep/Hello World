[Intro]

Verse 1: G

Okay! Hello Hello... I know they feel me, they do /
Your wifey, my side chick... she told me you cum quick /
She call me, I answer, then she say give me D /
So I give I give - she take a lot...what is that? OD /
But tis only discipline all these bad girls that I hit /
And tis only ego boost all these downloads that I get/
So we outchea... tis like 3 in the morning /
With her mouth wide open... but she is not yawning /
All this buzz that I’m getting got me feeling like a newBee /
Got a yellow bone mascot... and I call her Zakumi /
Minnie dlamini... will you marry me? /
.... And ima score, khune can't stop me /
I need a girl thats ratchet! I need a girl thats outchea /
And a bottle of that grey goose... And a whole lota dash too /
Im stupid thou, I know it too...but I guess tis all good /
Coz they all get blessed every time I get atchu...
