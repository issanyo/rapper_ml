[Verse 1]

I'm a young stunner on Homestar Runner
Home run running on basic bitch bummers
Bum rushin' tummies with Tum's tablets
Bubblin' on all three tabs of Jesse White Tumblrs
Shittin' on Twitter with my home run hitters
Bitter it's not butter but I better get my pecker up
Pucker up, pick a puck to fuck with a bubble butt
Pucker up, pick a puck to fuck with a bubble butt

[Verse 2]

We used to be best buds
Used to smoke the best buds bruh but you know I'm lying
Haven't touched an ounce in a past life frying
Eggs on the pavement
Beggin' in the basement
Based God fake shit spewing my lips
Uzi on his hips
Hollow in the tips

[Hook]

Halloween 'til she holla back
Louie for the trips
Model Queen 'til she watch my back
Etchin' all the RIPs
Bottle fiend 'til she break my back
Itchin' in my chips
Throttle Speed 'til she hit her max
Mackin' on this grip
(x2)

Mackin' on this grip
M-m-mackin' on this grip
(x2)
