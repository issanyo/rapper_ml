[Intro]
Bottles of whatever
Bottles of whatever
Bottles of whatever
A couple bottles of whatever

[Verse 1]
Uh I done met some girls since we was last together
And even told a few that we would last forever
But we both knew that that wasn't true
Cause let's be honest that's that same lie that I told you
So she saying I'm the reason she can't find hope
Gave her these feeling now she can't cope
So I'm the reason that she always wanna smoke
I'm getting faded as she blowing laughing when she choke
I always keep my shit on replay
She look at me and say I love the shit that he say
And it's too bad that he isn't you
Why can't you be more like these people that you listen to
But I'm still better than her last main
So if I give to her she would take my last name
That's when you text me and it read baby I love you
I hit this jack then hit you back maybe I love you too

[Hook]
Days keep on passing nights keep on passing
Downing these bottles got me drowning in this passion
Passion
Passion
Got me drowning in this passion
Nights keep on passing days keep on passing
Downing these bottles got me drowning in this passion
Passion
Passion
Got me drowning in this passion

[Verse 2]
It's 4 pm I can't remember yesterday
How I got in let alone that shit we'd say
Cups everywhere alcohol gushing through me
Plus we got the whole room smelling like kush and pussy
Thinking bout what you'd say if you'd seen me
Panties on the night stand bra on the tv
That lil plastic keeps the maids out my floor suite
Check my phone all I see fake statuses false tweets
Fuck it I let'em all know how I feel
And if you think I need a filter then you can't handle the real
Now she fresh out the shower and she naked as she come back
Lay on the bed she put her head in my lap
And she saying that she think I'm the right one
I crack a bottle she smack lips as she light one
Thats when you send a text and it said baby I want you
I hit this sky then I reply maybe I want you too

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Passion
Passion
Got me drowning in this passion
Passion
Passion
Got me drowning in this passion

[Outro]
Bottles of whatever
Bottles of whatever
Bottles of whatever
Couple bottles of whatever
Bottles of whatever
Wish that they would last forever
Cause these bottles of whatever is what's keeping us together
