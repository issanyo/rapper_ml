[Chorus: G, The Wiz]
Without you, Without you
I don’t where I’d be
No, Not without you
Here’s to all the good times and the bad times
And all the times I said it was the last time
Without you, without you
I couldn’t find myself no not without you
This one is for Michael and to Vinny and the donut crew
To Mary and to Gabe and to Carmen too

[Verse One: G, The Wiz]
Hey!
Let me take it back, take it back for a bit
On that home run on that Sandlot shit
Raised up in North Del but Surrey it made me
Where the doors are red and kids got no daddy
And behind 25 rest a young a shy mind
In his teens looking thin with his dreams not far
With a paper and a pen he wrote bars like a star
Put faith in the art before a nice hot car
Before the old dead lawn
We had a good thing on
Before we cut coupons
Had dad to rely on
Never came from that business trip
Never did he ever get my father’s day gift
I can’t even try to think of all the good things he did
I guess it’s sorta why I think I grew up like this
I got two older sisters working retail stores
Independent little brother shares the wisdom he knows
Tells me everything I often tend to over look
Like love ain’t a girl but it’s more like a home
Where you can sing out your heart in a microphone
But they all couldn’t see
The little bit of sadness in me
G

[Chorus: G, The Wiz]
Without you, I don’t where I’d be
No, Not without you
Here’s to all the good times and the bad times
And all the times I said it was the last time
Without you, without you
I couldn’t find myself no not without you
This one is for Michael and to Vince and the whole donut crew
To Mary and to Gabe and to Carmen too

[Verse Two: G, The Wiz]
And they say, G, you won’t make it
The way you handle life
The fans they won’t listen
You better quit your job if this is your passion
I say I’ll do me because I've got my balance
I’ve seen a lot of faces, in many different places
Made it through fine through worst of the cases
Many that would struggle and sweat like they’re in trouble
You see, I ran far; my heart, soul in the rubble
And maybe i’ll make it or maybe I’ll grow
I'll write another novel, play another show
Anything is okay but this my forte
You see I got a plan, I ride on my own wave
Serving coffee but I come home to recording
Working til dawn then work in the morning
I used to work graveyard at YVR
I sold CD’s to make ends meat
I quit 8 eights job and ran around
I fell in love and I learned to drown
Heartbreak and new sounds
Airplanes and new towns
Surrey, Newton, Delta, Abby, Langley is my town
You know I rep that 604
Because what the hell are friends for?
Kept it lit since old school
This here right here is for the true few, so

[Chorus: G, The Wiz]
Without you, I don’t where I’d be
Not without you
Here’s to all the good times and the bad times
And all the times I said it was the last time
Without you, without you
I couldn’t find myself no not without you
This one is for Michael and to Vince and the whole donut crew
To Mary and to Gabe and to Carmen too
