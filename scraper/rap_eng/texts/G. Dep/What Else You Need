[Hook]
You got G on the beat
Man what else you need
You got G on the beat
Man what else you need x4

[Bridge]
Fuck theese gold chains
Golg rings
Gold phangs
Cause When you dead
This shit butter baby
It won’t make a change x2


Verse 1

We need change for the better
Baby we don’t need no stain
Pulling triggers on a nigga
Just so you can rock his chain

Im not saying imma saint
But nigga i ain’t switching lanes
Cause life ain’t a game
You don’t get a second chance

When it rains bitch it pours
Some got rich and were pour
They were working everyday
Till their mind got fucking sore

So if you think you reach your goal
By robbing a store
Take a shovel dig in deep
Cause ain’t reaching the source

[Hook ]
You got G on the beat
Man what else you need
You got G on the beat
Man what else you need x4

[Bridge]
Fuck theese gold chains
Golg rings
Gold phangs
Cause when you dead
This shit butter baby
It won’t make a change x2

Verse 2

We were gifted with this life
But we not destined of our path
Everyday we make decisions
And they’re ain’t no going back

Roll the dice with a knife
Stab your brother in the back
Roll again different option
Cut some veggies for a snack


Like the sound of this clap
You chose this bad bitch
Thats a fact
At night when you sleep
Some other dude she chats

You chose this bitch cause she pretty
Nice boobs and ass
All them niggas want to hit her
Now, yo ex maad

But don’t tell me it was destiny
You know cheats occasionally
Will you choose to stay or not
We’ll see bout that
We’ll see bout that

[Hook]
You got G on the beat
Man what else you need
You got G on the beat
Man what else you need x4

[Bridge]
Fuck theese gold chains
Golg rings
Gold phangs
Cause when you dead
This shit butter baby
It won’t make a change x2
