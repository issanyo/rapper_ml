[Intro]
Shine, Phone won't let it
Like the Uno, Dos
I thought I let you know
I let it go
[x7] Aye
(I think I might be happy)
[x3] Aye


[Hook]
Geobaskets when I take the steps, cinemax and sex
I might finger roll her lips, thumbing through these counterfeits
I'm trained to go master piccolo, say you ain't saying shit
Might give yo wifey the pipe for the night, get her right
Shorty, can't nobody do it like me...
[x2]stunt on em, Sensational
My nigga I keep it a buck with you
Do differently I can't ever fuck with you
Hold my dick and it might just get up for you
Don't run if i gotta run up on you
It's the phone, yeah you know 1 and 2
I might smash out, you know what I do
Gon' pass out, sensational


[Verse 1]
Red truck, Blue truck, Green truck, Black truck whippin'
Bad bitch, ugly friend, she too skinny but that's yo business
Sips tea, lick read, shut down the ritz ybor city
Cloverfield then the field, still take a bitch on a pic..nic
Rain cold, nigga is..nit
Gettin money, nigga don't..trip
Ya'll be talking nigga close..lips
Doors open, bad..bitch
Sell yo soul for a low..tick-et

Ran outta money, tryna Flex now they laugh at you
Slick Five, Get right
Dirty Sprite, Savage life

You can't feel my pain(aye)
