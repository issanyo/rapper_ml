[Verse 1: T. James]

Sittin' here alone writing this in the dark
Flickin' my lighter over and over gave me a spark
Most of these dogs don’t bite, they all bark
But you can get your jaw clocked with them remarks
I'm not on the block sellin’ chalk
I’m on a writer’s block cause I’m thinkin’ ‘bout a lot
Put all that into thought and jot down what I’m feeling
The pain still lingers and I’m barely healing
A loved one just got cancer, now I see life from a man vision
I’m running from God waiting for a damn collision
With the devil, like the plans are settled from the sinnin’
But God's grinnin’ so I know he has more power in him
He has a glass of faith for me, I better get to sippin’
I rather die than see my people struggle to keep livin’
But til then, I’ma keep my head high and keep livin’
Cause if no one else is giving up then why should I give in?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: G]

You know those things you think about right before you fall asleep?
I take all of those things and put 'em all on a beat
I've got visions of the future minus the PCP or LSD
I'm still trippin' on everything that I see
McDonald's on every corner, ready to take your order
Knowing that their product gets you closer to the coroner
I ain't saying Illuminati, I'm saying that paparazzi
Gots you watching on somebody irrelevant to your life
See we care more about who is so and so's wife
Than we care who's in charge of laws of all types
I see the flaws in the stripes and stars of ours
Hallucinating about the freedoms we probably already lost
The patriot act had me acting like "where's the patriots?"
Asking more questions than an undercover atheist
Fluoride in your toothpaste, gots you trippin' like a shoelace
It ain't hard to see the truth when you realize you're facing it!
