Verse (SliQ)

Yeah I think about this everyday
I’m a product of my thoughts tryna’ get myself paid
Put my heart in & though my heart breaks it’s just waves
The key is to float & I’m in flat fleet that makes sails
I’ve been materializing the dreams since I woke up
Getting fizzy when it comes to the cream like soda
It’s never been a ghost hunt
Figures, I should let ‘em in when I post cards
See I play right whenever
When stakes are high at measure
Tryna get mine watch me eliminating my contenders
AS I’m saying this with pleasure, this is making time for cheddar
I work with workaholics so they ain’t no time for leisure
Man the money is the target for the passion as a motive
You should know this, that’s just a reminder you should know this
It’s that heavy medal tone so the sound is golden
Gotta put the money where my mouth is & get this gold in

Chorus + Hook (PxSH)

I’m tryna get it, tryna have it all
And I’ll be screaming n*gger f*ck the law
I mean I’m tryna make paper
I see an image of it later
Like oh (x8)

Verse (G)

Okay... G’s verse, so you know what it i
I got poor man’s dreams but sleep is for the rich
Its workaholic G… & and still I have not done enough
It’s probably my realest verse, none of this is made up
Turned 18… & I’ve been tryna get it all
Do it for my n*ggers, man loyalty is all I know
With a bunch of b*tches & all these girls is down to go
So we go… we go...
But the hustle real, tryna get on stage doe
Dream chasing, hardly sleeping, napping when I need to though
So I’m always there to answer when duty calls
I be like “I’m coming”, that’s something like a booty call
And still study IT, so I’m tryna get it right
So all I write is line… that could be code or rhymes

Chorus + Hook (PxSH)

Verse (Ryu)

Headed to the top
Yall about to fall
Swear to never stop
Till I have it all
Changing the game to what it should have been
Am a no dream, I’m a prophecy, a vision only those with vision see
Am the reason lames losing sleep
With flows to bring back the lost sheep
Fans don’t know what to say, cause normally they’d ask that I go deep
But since underground is where I’m from, now it’s time I hit the mainstream
Becoming tomorrow’s kids dream
Am dropping fly shit like a pigeon, focused like a surgeon
That one rapper to believe in like religion
My mix tape… Highly anticipated
My words like weed… Highly appreciated
You rappers been sleeping, Ain’t no need to lie
Ain’t nobody told me so your music testifies
How the rap game you sacrificed

Chorus + Hook (PxSH)
