This was never the way
I planned Not my intention
I got so brave, hand in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I Kissed Sam and I liked it
The taste of his Cute Lips
I Kissed Sam just to try it
I hope my Boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean anything, right?
I Kissed Sam and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter,
You're my experimental game
Just human nature,
It's not what,
Amazing people do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I Kissed Sam and I liked it
The smell of his Hot Hands
I Kissed Sam just to try it
I hope my Boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean anything, right?
I Kissed Sam and I liked it
I liked it,

Those boys they are so magical
Cute Lips, Hot Hands, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I Kissed Sam and I liked it
The sound of his Loveable arms
I Kissed Sam just to try it
I hope my Boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean anything, right?
I Kissed Sam and I liked it
I liked it
I liked the feel of his Awesome Hair
I liked the feel of his Awesome Hair
