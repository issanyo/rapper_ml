Get with the, get with the M G M V E
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Spinning out in another galaxy
My baby and me, so far away
Two thousand years, some kinda fantasy
My baby and me, interstellar odyssey
Floating forever in zero gravity
Come together in intergalactic unity

Oh, are we trippin' out or is that heaven I see?
