I was coming out my front door
When I looked to my left and seen
The flyest chick I swear I'd ever seen before
She must be something special
I'd never seen nobody like her ever
Everything about this chick was (..). from head to toe
And then I noticed that she was smiling at ya boy
But before I holla, I gotta make sure that my game is proper

The clock is going tic-tac, tic-tac, tic. tac
Your about to miss a once in a lifetime shot
But I gotta get it straight. to make sure what I say
Let her know just what I'm feeling

(Chorus:)
What do you do when you finally see
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams
Say something (don't let her pass by)
Say something (just look her in the eyes)
Hey shorty, can I get a minute of your time?
I know we never met before but I
Just say something (don't let her pass by)
Say something (cause she only comes once in a lifetime)

I'm getting ready to step to her, but I noticed her friends
Was looking at me like they really didn't think I should
A lonely man has got to have it
He can't let nothing in the world. stop it
So excuse me Miss, but can I get your number
I think your sexy. can I call you up sometime?
I get that, baby girl take mine
Anytime you wanna call, it's all right

The clock is going tic-tac, tic-tac, tic. tac

Your about to miss a once in a lifetime shot
But I gotta get it straight. to make sure what I say
Let her know just what I'm feeling

(Chorus:)
What do you do when you finally see
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams
Say something (don't let her pass by)
Say something (just look her in the eyes)
Hey shorty, can I get a minute of your time?
I know we never met before but I
Just say something (don't let her pass by)
Say something (cause she only comes by once in a lifetime)

I can't believe I found the one right outside my front door. (outside my door)
It seems like I have heard about this a thousand times before. (a thousand times before)
So I knew I had to build the nerve, I knew I had to find the words
The right thing to say. I just couldn't let you walk away

(Chorus:)
What do you do when you finally see
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams
Say something (don't let her pass by)
Say something (just look her in the eyes)
Hey shorty, can I get a minute of your time?
I know we never met before but I
Just say something (don't let her pass by)
Say something (cause she only comes by once in a lifetime)

Tic-tac. tic-tac. the clock is ticking
Tic-tac. tic-tac. the clock is ticking
Tic-tac. tic-tac. the clock is ticking
Tic-tac. tic-tac. the clock is ticking
