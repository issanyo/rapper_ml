It feels like only yesterday that you were lying here with me
I still hear you say... OOO YEA, i love the way... OOO YEA
But now its just a memory
Now im knowing that it was my fault
By thinking i could brush it off
You always with me saying... OOO YEA
So what its 5am im checking in when i check in

Baby i was thinking, im so slick
Knowing that ive done you wrong
But you never know what you got
Til what you got is gone

Got to try and make it through
Without you
And theres nothing i can do
Come on home baby (repeat)

I remember comong home that night
Knowing something wasn't right
I was saying... OOO YEA
Im sure that all her things are packed
And its just too late to get her back
Didn't even have to read the note
Just to know that your heart was broke
I was thinking... OOO YEA
You had more than you can stand
I should have been a better man

Baby i was thinking, im so slick
Girl i was doing you so wrong
But you never know what you got
Til what you got is gone

Im so sorry for the things ive done
I should have put you number one
But ive been playing myself
Cause i know that you're all i want
But if you give me one more chance
I'll break it down for you lady
No more playing around
Baby i want to be there for you
Gonna make it through
