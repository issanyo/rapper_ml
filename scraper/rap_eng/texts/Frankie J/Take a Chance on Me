You're so scared of falling in love
'Cause you end up in the dust, every time ...
EVERY TIME!
Now you see us all the same
Like our words are just a game, spitting lies...
DIRTY LIES!

(CHORUS)
I know, you know there's something here
But you cannot get past the fear
I can help you make it clear

So when you feel like trying again...
Reach out, take my hand!
See how great it could be...
To fall in love, With someone you can trust
Who will never give up!
Cause your all that he needs!

Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!

(END CHORUS)
You give 100 percent
But you've never seen a cent
They're so blind... THEY'RE SO BLIND!!
Cause im looking at your face
And the worlds a better place
In your eyes... LONELY EYES!

(CHORUS)
I know, you know there's something here
But you cannot get past the fear
I can help you make it clear

So when you feel like trying again...
Reach out, take my hand!

See how great it could be...
To fall in love, With someone you can trust
Who will never give up!
Cause your all that he needs!

Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!

(END CHORUS)
You've got nothing to lose ...BABY!
But you won't know if you don't try
Just don't leave me asking why
So when your ready to choose, BABY..
Ill be here with open arms
With the same love in my.. HEART!!!!

(CHORUS)
I know, you know there's something here
But you cannot get past the fear
I can help you make it clear

So when you feel like trying again...
Reach out, take my hand!
See how great it could be...
To fall in love, With someone you can trust
Who will never give up!
Cause your all that he needs!

Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!
Baby take a chance on me!

(END CHORUS)
