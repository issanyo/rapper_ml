Last night she called me crying
Saying please don't be upset
She said what I'm about to tell you
You're gonna wish we never met
So I tried to keep myself calm
And listen to her speak
But her words just wouldn't come out
So I had to intervene
The sound of hers was cracking on
The phone
Immediately I felt something so wrong
I hope he breaks your heart
I hope he tells you lies
And makes you cry a river
Never helps it dry
I hope he lets you down
And never lifts you up
Runs away forever
Never to return
I hope he breaks your heart
Oooooo oooo ooooo
Well it felt like someone stabbed me
Ripped my heart out of my chest
When I heard he proposed to you and your answer was a yes
I guess this love was only hope to me
While you're only paying rent
But they say misery loves company
And I am so glad you're now with him
If Id known this from very start
I would've never given you my heart
I hope he breaks your heart
I hope he tells you lies
And makes you cry a river
And never helps it dry
I hope he lets you down
And never leaves you up
Runs away forever
Never to return
I hope he breaks the promises he makes
And takes way more than he'll ever gave
So you could feel the breaks I had to take
From which I still forgave you for
For you walked out the door
I hope he breaks your heart
I hope he tells you lies
And makes you cry a river, baby
I hope he lets you down
Never lift you up
Runs away forever, baby
I hope he breaks your heart
