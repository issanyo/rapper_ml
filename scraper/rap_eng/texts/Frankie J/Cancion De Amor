[Intro 1]
(I'll never forget that day
I love you, and I don't think I'll survive...)

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
Since we been together baby
We've been like the perfect song
We got our harmony and melody strong
Started out from nothing
Just dreams and a guitar
Together now look where we are

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
Our life is like a medley
I'm mixed with all these highs and lows
Photographic memory, ah
With the help of music notes

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Como una cancion de amor
(Una cancion de amor)
The one I adore
(The one I adore)
After the loving before
(After the loving before)
Una cancion, cancion, cancion, de amor, amor

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
All I wanna do is feel her like a love song
The DJ run it back like a club song
Bass hitting hard, Tyson with no gloves on
Number one on the charts and the love zone
I'm feeling high like them hats when I see your face
We make the bed go boom like them 808's
Go boom like them 808's, go boom like them 808's
And our love is a hit like the Beatles wrote it
When it's on the radio, everybody quote it
And your body is a hook cause it got me hooked
I'm sending love notes just like a music book

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
Our life is like a medley
I'm mixed with all these highs and lows
Photographic memory, ah
With the help of music notes

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Como una cancion de amor
(Una cancion de amor)
The one I adore
(The one I adore)
After the loving before
(After the loving before)
Una cancion, cancion, cancion, de amor, amor

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
I can zone to the tone of your voice cause it's so sweet
Like a sped up sample on the soul beat
Like Alicia Keys singing on the slow beat
Written lyrics and they taking up the whole sheet
Fly chicanita with your nails and your hair done
You be popping like the sound of my snare drum
Baby girl, when I get you up to my room
We gonna be the most downloaded iTune
Hip-hop, pop and soul, country music, rock'n'roll
On the radio countdown twenty weeks
Our love is platinum, our album never leaks

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
Our life is like a medley
I'm mixed with all these highs and lows
Photographic memory, ah
With the help of music notes

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Como una cancion de amor
(Una cancion de amor)
The one I adore
(The one I adore)
After the loving before
(After the loving before)
Una cancion, cancion, cancion, de amor, amor
