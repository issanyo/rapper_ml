Realized that something was missing, it just wasn't my day
And alone my intuition, saying she's going away
I'm getting chills just thinking about it, maybe everything's okay

And then the cold came in, and her best friend said
The train was leaving at night, she said you better hurry up, want to catch you girl
Hoping to get there on time, i couldn't waste another minute
I ran as fast as i could, feeling scared and agitated
I turned around and there you stood

And i had you there and you looked so beautiful
Had the build the nerve to find a way to let you know
I love you so
And i had you there
I couldn't let the moment go
Had to put my arms around you and let you know
Won't take for long..

It felt so lonely on the right side of the bed
Felt so cold under the covers, no-one laying on my left
Minutes turning into hours, and the hours turning into days
Going crazy here without you, as the longer i wait

And then the cold came in, and her best friend said
The train was leaving at night, she said you better hurry up, want to catch you girl
Hoping to get there on time, i couldn't waste another minute
I ran as fast as i could, feeling scared and agitated
I turned around and there you stood

And i had you there and you looked so beautiful
Had the build the nerve to find a way to let you know
I love you so
And i had you there
I couldn't let the moment go
Had to put my arms around you and let you know
Won't take for long..

Baby please.. You don't have to go
