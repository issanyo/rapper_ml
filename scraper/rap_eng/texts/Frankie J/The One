[Intro: Frankie J]
All right
I see you
Yeah, 'cause you're the one

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one girl)
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one girl)
Won't you come and put it on me

[Chorus: 3LW]
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one boy)
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one boy)
Won't you come and put it on me

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
Now I'm not sure
If I'm applying myself so good
On you
But I must say that I've been checking you out
When you broke through my hood
Got everybody like damn
Who's that introduce me
What's her name
Who she with
She a cutie
What she doing when she looking like that
Well she's with me as a matter of fact

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
She's my girl
My chick
Riding with me in my whip
She's my boo
My friend
See with her I gets my freak on

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one girl)
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one girl)
Won't you come and put it on me

[Chorus: 3LW]
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one boy)
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one boy)
Won't you come and put it on me

[Post-Chorus: Frankie J]
Oh, she's the one

[Post-Chorus: 3LW]
Oh, he's the one

[Verse 2: 3LW]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I'll pray the Lord my baby to keep
It's his touch
His smile
His sweater
His style
He's fly and he's all mine
And I don't mind
If he's out late at night
He's my best friend
I trust him
So promise me
You'll always do me right

[Pre-Chorus: 3LW]
He's my boo my man
Riding with me till the end
He's my boy
My friend
See with him I gets my freak on

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one girl)
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one girl)
Won't you come and put it on me

[Chorus: 3LW]
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one boy)
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one boy)
Won't you come and put it on me

[Post-Chorus: Frankie J]
Oh, she's the one

[Post-Chorus: 3LW]
Oh, he's the one

[Bridge: Frankie J]
She's my homie, lover, friend
And I'll love her till the end
I'm so glad that she's the one for me, oh yeah
She's my homie, lover, friend
She's a dime, a perfect ten
And I'm glad that she's the one for keeps, oh yeah

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one girl)
Superfly and so sexy
Baby you're the one for me (you're the one girl)
Won't you come and put it on me

Baby you're the one for me (you're the one boy)
Superfly and so sexy

Oh, she's the one

[Post-Chorus: 3LW]
Oh, he's the one

[Outro: 3LW]

The special things you do
Oh baby you're the one
Yeah you know you're my boo
