So tight, so fine
You got me lifted
You got me lifted
You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceiling
And ooh wee is the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly

You know is leather when we ride with gaining worldhide (worldwide)
Doing what we do getting watching things getting high
Girl you keep so fly
With your sweet hunny buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
Of side I can't lie
I love to get blowed
You're my lil suga
I'm lil your chulo
And every time we kick it
It's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky icky on my sweet ooh wee gooey

You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceiling
And ooh wee is the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly

And I ain't worried about a thing
Cause I just hit get me a lick
I got a fat sack and a super fly chick
And uh, I ain't making you to say to a player
Cause do I she fly like plays in the air
And that's right she fool wrong
Settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' ozone
So fly like a Dove
So fly like a Raven
Quit to politics, So fly conversation
In a natural move, I'm a natural dude
And we so natural fools blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama
With blades on up rounda
Rockin' dosing two bottles
With hyrdros with el corana

You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceiling
And oweee is the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted suga how you get so fly

Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly

You know is leather when we ride with gaining worldhide
Doing what we do getting watching things getting high
Girl you keep so fly
With your sweet hunny buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes

You know is leather when we ride with gaining worldhide
Doing what we do getting watching things getting high
