[Verse 1]
Never feel alone
Never feel there's no one there who cares for you
When every door seems closed
Mine is open wide for you
I'll give you strength
Restore your faith
Im the one who'll be around if it all falls down
I will hold you

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you break
I'll be there if you crumble
Come to you if you come undone
Catch you if you stumble
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place
If you break

[Verse 2]
Never feel ashamed
Never feel that it's weak if you should reach for me
When your chained by the pain
I'll be there to set you free
I'll give you love
I'll lift you up
I'm the one who'll be around if it all falls down
I will hold you

[Chorus]
I'll be there if you break
I'll be there if you crumble
Come to you if you come undone
Catch you if you stumble
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place
If you break

[Bridge]
But if there comes a time when I might need someone
Will you be there?
Say you'll be there

[Chorus]
Be there if I break
Be there if I crumble
Come to me if I come undone
Catch me if I stumble
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place
If you break

[Outro]
I'll be there if you crumble
Come to you if you come undone
Catch you if you stumble
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place
If you break
If you break
If you break
