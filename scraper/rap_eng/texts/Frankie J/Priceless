Listen
I'm the kind of man
Who really doesn't take the time to understand
That what I did was wrong
But girl you forced my hand
And now girl look at me
Got people saying
I'm not that crazy
Okay I take it back
Whatever it was I said
Oh girl I take it back
Where in the hell was I when you started to pack your bags?
Why didn't you talk to me?
What about my letters?
Did you ever get 'em?

Still smell your scent all in my bed
I'm at the place where we first met
And I'm sending you a ticket
And if you still feel it
Meet me there
'Cause when I look at me I'm like a puzzle Without the pieces I need
Girl I'm in trouble
I need you to come and save me
Oh, I miss my baby
I need you there
Say you'll be there
Ride a jet over seas
Hotels are on the beach
To be with you again is priceless

Now I'm in the room
Watching the clock every hour waiting to here from you
I called the airline they said you'll be landing soon
So I'm on my way
I got a thousand things in my head I want to say girl
I love you and I miss
Would it be too much if I kiss you
Baby let me paint this picture
I ain't shit if I ain't with you
No, no, oh no, oh no
Should I listen?
Is that what was missing?

Tell me baby

Still smell your scent all in my bed (in my bed)
I'm at the place where we first met
I'm sending you this ticket
And if you still feel it
Meet me there
'Cause when I look at me I'm like a puzzle (When I look at me Baby)
Without the pieces I need
Girl I'm in trouble
I need you to come and save me (I need your love)
Oh I miss my baby (cause I need your love)
I need you there (I ned you there oh Babe oh Baby)
Say you'll be there (I'm lonely without you)
Ride a jet over seas (I'll pay for everythihng)
Hotels are on the beach (but that don't mean a thing)
To be with you again is priceless (if you're not here with me)

I'm at the airport waiting on you
Wishing you'd show up
I hope you do
If you still believe
You're my missing piece
The guard is telling me
Man I got to leave

I'm at the airport waiting on you
Wishing you'd show up
I hope you do
If you still believe
You're my missing piece
I know money can buy me anything
Except for you

When I look at me I'm like a puzzle Without the pieces I need
Girl I'm in trouble
I need you to come and save me (said I need you Baby)
Oh I miss my baby (come and save me)
I need you there (got a big ol house up on the hill
Say you'll be there (but its so empty 'cause you're not here)
Ride a jet over seas
Hotels are on the beach
To be with you again is priceless (I need you Baby)
