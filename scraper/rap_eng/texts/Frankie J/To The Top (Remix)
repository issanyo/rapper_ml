[Intro: Omar Cruz]
Whoo!
Yeah
It's ya boy
O. Cruz
This goin' out to all those muh'fuckers that down with me from day one, man
We're here now
Let's ride out

[Verse 1: Omar Cruz]
It was all a dream
My fantasy, for a young Latin kid
Actin' like I was rappin' in front of thousands, I laugh at it now
But back then, the struggle really had a grip on me
And all my family could really do was wish the best of me (Whoo!)
We had it hard, growin' up in the barrio
When muh'fuckers would ride out and bury you with the saw
When they sense street light, I wrote my first song
Every single night in bed, I'm hearin' shots go off {*two gunshots*}
But through the pain and sorrow, and all the cloudy days
I would find a way to make sunrays brighten up my day
Ignorin' all the bassheads and the one time
That's out to make us pure California sunshine
Even the homies that know me, they know I said it, "Solely
Only for all my soldados," mamis is showin' they chonies (Ha ha)
Cause now we made it, we struggled to make it right
We hustle just to survive, we celebratin' this life (Come on)

[Hook: Frankie J.]
Can't stop, ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop, ain't no toppin' this
Candy drop, six-four's hop to this now
(Where we taking this man?) To the top
Can't stop, ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop, worked too hard for this shit to pop
Ain't no stoppin' us now
(Let's go) To the top

[Verse 2: Snowhite Tha Product]
I do solemnly swear, that you will see this latina on top
Cause even though its been a while it takes way more to ever stop a message like mine, a presence like mine
I promise youll turn on your tv and be pleasantly surprised
Its meant for me to rise, i bet you see me fight
Through the struggles you see me going through but imma get mine
That little Mexicana, la que antes hera rara
Ya crecio y ahora cieren la boca y limpiense la baba
Porque desde chicita, sabia que era muy viva
Sabia que habia razon porque era tremenda y ahora mira
Im on my way up and theres just no stopping us
I got the talent and drive  now i just need the luck
And i just need the bucks to get a real collab with Omar
Or finally get a hold of someone who wants me to co-star
I know imma get there but im so anxious i can't take it
But out of all these Mexicans, well someone's gotta make it

[Hook: Frankie J.]
Can't stop, ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop, ain't no toppin' this
Candy drop, six-four's hop to this now
(Where we taking this man?) To the top
Can't stop, ain't no stoppin' us
Won't stop, worked too hard for this shit to pop
Ain't no stoppin' us now
(Let's go) To the top
