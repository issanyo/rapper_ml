Dont remember were we met. (All i do know)
Is that i said hi and she looked me up and down
(And she said lets go)
So we went to a spot,out the back, Blazin hot
Clothes come off,it was on,headbored broke. Mine was blown. After the session she checked her messages on her cell. All of a sudden her face just froze and her eyes got big as hell. The message said hey baby, suprise surprise, Girl im free. I'll be home around 3. But it was alredy 3:15

She said he stood about 7ft 9
Killed some cat for looking at her and got 25 to life
And somehow he's out today,and this fool he's on his way. He'll snap your neck and not think twice
Get your things and goodnight
Now i ain't trippin, 'cause if there ain't no man i like, i feel
