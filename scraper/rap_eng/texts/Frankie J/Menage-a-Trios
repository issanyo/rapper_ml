Show me what your body do

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Down and dirty, rough and rugged
Dog nasty, but you love it
You gon' lick it, I'm gonna shove it
Uh-uh
Uh-uh
When I hit it from the back, you can kiss the cat
Grab your toy, baby, grab your strap
I'm a kick back, light up a sack
Last name +Off+, first name is +Jack+
You know the dil-do
So grab the dildo
And let's
Do the damn thing, so I can tell my kin folks
About that there [{*shit*}] we did
About that there freak you did
And landed on my face
Oooh, baby girl, I love the taste
Got me livin' my fantasy
Baby, come and dance for me
You got that candy cream
Let me see you pull your panty string
Let your thong slide to the side, chica, open wide
And let my fine ass baby mama put her tongue inside
Tongue kissin', naked to the world
Such a nasty girl
You got me fiendin' every time I'm dreamin' of the pearl
Twice Last Night, once in the mornin', that's your favorite song
It turns you on, leave your pumps on, baby, watch me hit it strong
Baby Bashy, you so nasty
Love the threesome, for the top notch jazzies
Smokin' on purp', of that purple grassy
Now what your body do

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 2: Mr. Shadow]
Ain't no telling what a fella gonna do
When it's me, your friend and you, all alone
And we getting' it on, like the name of the song
It's just the freak in you
And me
And her, fuck it
Every body in this motherfucker
We doing it sick
Not givin' a shit, Shadow the Chicken Plucker
I wanna know, what you got on your mind
Is it the same as mine, we can bump and grind
And tell your friend she can come along
Why?
I would never leave her behind
Hell no
Never mind the lovin' shit
Remember I'm a thuggin', bitch
Fuck her up, run trains of dick
Cause all I give you dirty tricks, and that's it
No shame in the game I play
Me and Bash got pie to lay
Texas, Californ-I-A
Smokin' weed, pokin' bitches all night and day
Right away, in the hot water
Put my hook, in the sea, and I cop water
I gotta take it or leave it, and believe it or not
I got the eye of an eagle
And I spot 'em
Hah

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Don Cisco]
It's me at the Holiday Inn, Howard Johnson
Me and two friends like Charlie Bronson
Locked up in a suite, in between sheets, gang bangin' top nothes
Huh
I'm the bossiest playa like the freak Steve Austin
I don't give a fuck what shit be costin'
Keep bad bitches, pretty friends be flossin'
Sex And The City every time we tossin'
Never leave the pad without packin' precaution
Frisco Mac, so proceed with caution
Me and these dudes in the streets is often
Blaze up a sack and a chronic offerin'
Outlaw on the run, kamikaze with a gun
Don Cisco, baby
When I ride, I'm bossin', gonna
Have some fun, it's rollin' crazy
2-1-1, girl, I like them odds
You can rock my world
I'll make you scream, for the Gods
In between the sheets, all night
I'll freak you hard
Keep it cool
What you speakin' on?
Shut your mouth
And just tweak it on
Close your lips
Leak you wrong
Creep

Hook: Frankie J
You know I like to watch
You know I like to see it
I'm kinda freaky, mama
Oh, baby, please believe it
You know I like to watch (You know I like to watch)
You know I like to see it
I'm kinda freaky, mama (You like I like to see it)
Oh, baby, please believe it
