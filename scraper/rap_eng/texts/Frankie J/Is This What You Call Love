You've seen him many times
There's no use denying
I've heard you on the phone

I've even followed you to all the places were you've secertly have been alone

I even know about the times when you would say to me that you was overwhelmed with work
You had to stay longer working overtime
But you were always lying
Baby I might be dumb but I'am not blind

At times I feel like I want to break down inside

I got to find a way out cuz this is tearing me to pieces, I just want to make it right

Is this what you call love explain to me baby, Is this really what you want from me (Is this what you want from me)

I'am losing my patience, just hear what I'am saying You don't want to break the family (Don't break this family)

Is this what you call love
Then you got it all wrong
This isn't the way our lives should be
I just won't allow somebody to become between us

Is this what you call love
Is this what you call love

You come home late at night
Pretending it's alright, acting like you're doing nothing wrong, As you lay down right beside me, inside I'am dying

You just don't understand the pain that you have put me thru (just don't understand)

After all the thing I have ever done for you, sometimes I rather be alone
Than have a broken home
Whatever happened to forever, cuz I still want to know, explain to me you change of heart

Is this what you call love
