[Verse 1]
He drops his suitcase by the door
She knows her daddy won't be back anymore
She drags her feet across the floor
Tryna hold back time to keep him holding on
And she says

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy, daddy, don't leave
I'll do anything to keep you right here with me
Can't you see how much I need you?
Daddy, daddy, don't leave
Mommy's saying things she don't mean
She don't know what she's talking about
Somebody hear me out...

[Chorus]
Father listen
Tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father save him
I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room
Try hard in school
I'll be good
I promise you
Father, Father
I pray to you

[Verse 2]
Now she hasn't slept in weeks
She don't want to close her eyes
'cause she's scared that he'll leave
They've tried just about everything
But it's getting harder for him to breathe
And she says...

[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy, daddy, don't leave
I'll do anything to keep you right here with me
Can't you see how much I need you
Daddy, daddy, don't leave
The doctors are saying things they don't mean
They don't know what they talking about
Somebody hear me out...

[Chorus]
Father listen
Tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father save him
I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room
Try hard in school
I'll be good
I promise you
Father, Father
I pray to you

[Hook]
Please don't let him go (don't let him go)
I'm begging you so (I'm begging you so)
There, open his eyes
Need a little more time
To tell him that I love him more
Than anything in the world
Is daddy's little girl

[Chorus]
Father listen
Tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father save him
I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room
Try hard in school
I'll be good
I promise you
Father, Father
I pray to you

[Outro]
She was daddy's little girl........
