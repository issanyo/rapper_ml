I'll fix you dinner and a movie
And take a dip in the jacuzzi
How would you like that?
How would you like that?

We'll set the mood with some red wine
I don't drink, but a sip's fine
How would you like that?
How would you like that?

Look at you, standing there
Flirting with those eyes while you twirling your hair
I know what you do 'cause I'm mesmerized
We could have the time of our lives
Tell me, how would you like that?
How would you like that?

'Cause I would really like that

We could play a little music
I wanna see your body grooving
How would you like that?
How would you like that?

Or we could pick out on some junk food
Don't worry, baby, I won't judge you
How would you like that?
How would you like that?

Look at you, standing there
Flirting with those eyes while you twirling your hair
I know what you do 'cause I'm mesmerized
We could have the time of our lives
Oh, yeah, how would you like that?
How would you like that?

'Cause I would really like that

'Cause I would really like that

How would you like that?
How would you like that?

'Cause I would really like that

Look at you, standing there
Flirting with those eyes while you twirling your hair
I know what you do 'cause I'm mesmerized
We could have the time of our lives
Oh, yeah

I'll fix you dinner and a movie
And take a dip in the jacuzzi
How would you like that?
How would you like that?
