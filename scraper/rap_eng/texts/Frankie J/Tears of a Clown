I swear I didn't mean to baby
Put you through hell
I didn't mean all those crazy
Things that I yell
I don't wanna cover my wounds
I would rather let them bleed
I deserve every word, for everything that I did

Look at these tears, tears of a clown
Look at these tears, oh they keep rolling down
Look at these tears, tears of a clown
Look at these tears, tears of a clown

I promise you this time I'mma give you my best
I don't ever want you to leave ever again
I would do what I can, your wish is my command, whatever you demand
I surrender my heart, I just want a new start, look at these tears in my eyes

Look at these tears, tears of a clown
Look at these tears, oh they keep rolling down
Look at these tears, tears of a clown
Look at these tears, tears of a clown

I'm pleading for forgiveness
Please forgive me, allow your heart to give in
Oh won't you hear this, I'm humble bout your feelings
Cause I'm on my way to a brand new start

Look at these tears, tears of a clown
Look at these tears, oh they keep rolling down
Look at these tears, tears of a clown
Look at these tears, tears of a clown
