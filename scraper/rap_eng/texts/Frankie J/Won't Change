I was young, i was dumb
Didn't know what i was thinkin
Use to think that i could rule the world
That's the way...i be livin
Fast cars always shoppin at the malls
Never carring for your heart
Always with my friend yeah

Till you came along
And opened up my eyes
You asked me what was going on
Seemed that something had changed inside ..oh my
Said that i was trippen
And slowly i was slippin
In another bad situation
And i said to myself
I dont wanna go that route

Cuz i ont wanna loose you babe
You know that im still down
I dont't wanna lose you babe
Just keep me on the ground
I don't wanna lose you babe
You know that i won't change
Cause for you i'd do anything and everything
You know that i won't change a thang

You're my moon,you're my sun
You're my stars, you are my every thang
And i'm sorry if i haven't made
You feel that way...ok..
I've been a fool,i know it's true
And i've gotta make it..up to you babe..
I gotta show you that i still
Acknowledge you..
