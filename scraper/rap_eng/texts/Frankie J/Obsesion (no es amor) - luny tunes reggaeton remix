Obsession...
Well it's early in the morning
And my heart is feelin' lonely
Just thinkin' about you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin turnin' in my bed
Well It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinking about your beauty it makes me weak...
I'm feeling hopeless in my heart
I dont know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby...
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin)
What am I doin wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (it's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart
Could this be love
Or it could be an obsession
Likkle tings yuh do drive this man so mad
O puede ser amor
Puede que sea una ilusion
Lo que siento por ti no tiene explicacion
Yo, It's just past 12 o'clock, me only thinking 'bout yuh
Nena me a need yuh ina me side right now
Lo poquito que me ha hecho me tiene bien loco
Di only ting me want es tenerte a mi lado
Tell yuh likkle man he done, tell him go go
Him a waste too much time and he nuh satisfy yuh
No te va a dar nunca lo que quiere, pa' eso estoy yo
Baby gyal sin along, this is your song
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin)
What am I doin wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (it's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart
(ooh) I love the way you freak it like that
(ooh) I love the way you freak it like that
(ooh) I love the way you freak it like that
It's an obsession
Now I know you're not my lady
But I'm tryin' to make this right
I don't know what to do
I'm going out of my mind
So baby if you let me
Kick it with you then we'll maybe
We could ride together
We could do this all night
Now I don't care if you've got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feelin' (then what am I feelin)
What am I doing wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (It's just an illusion)
That I have in my heart
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling (then what am I feelin)
What am I doing wrong (what am I doin wrong)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (is this an illusion)
That I have in my heart?
Amor...
