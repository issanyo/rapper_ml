[Frankie J]
I'm never gonna let you down

[Krayzie Bone]
I know we goin through a lot of thangs
But then I'm really keepin you tight
'Cause in the true light
'Cause I wanna do right
I can leave this game
'Cause baby I ain't trippin on the meaningless fame, hey
Never let none test, one flesh
Take it step by step 'til death
And we can get back up and we can ball if we should fall (if we should fall)
Its truly a blessin... come directly from Heaven
Through death and a ressurection
I'ma be right there by your side
Never let you down never need to cry
Wipe your eye, eye, eye
Wipe your eye, eye, eye
Wipe your eye, eye, eye
Wipe your eye, eye, eye

[Frankie J]
