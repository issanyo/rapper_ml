Excuse me baby...
I'd just rather be sincere
Cause there ain't no guy like me
That can give you what you need

Did ya like my 6-4 Impala?
Always on my mind
Take a trip up to the Bahamas
Withcha by my side
Cause I know you deserve
For you to see the world...
Baby girl

You deserve
The house, the cars, the ring, baby
You deserve
Whatever you need, those shoppin' sprees
You deserve
The life, the mind, to be free
You deserve it all
So what's it gonna take to get with you?

If you were my girl
You'd be the top of the line, my model
You don't have to worry about nada
Your my Gucci, Louis, my Prada
If you were my girl
You'd be the top of the line in my Phantom
The perfect things you'd have 'em
Top of the Line

The way that you walk girl
It's top of the line
You'd be my everything
Top of the line

(Slim)
First look I knew I had to make you mine
See your style and it seems to fit mine
Say it like you have everything, still incomplete
It would be so much better if you only had me

You deserve
The house, the cars, the ring, baby
You deserve
Whatever you need, shoppin' sprees
You deserve
The life, the mind, to be free
You deserve it all
So what's it gonna take to get with you?

If you were my girl
You'd be the top of the line, my model
You don't have to worry about nada
Your my Gucci, Louis, my Prada
If you were my girl
You'd be the top of the line in my Phantom
The perfect things you'd have 'em
Top of the Line

The way that you walk girl
It's top of the line
You'd be my everything
Top of the line

No matter what you do
At the end of the day she'll forget about you
She'll be calling my phone while you're all alone
Waiting on her call
Let's see who gets her first

If you were my girl
You'd be the top of the line, my model (Model)
You don't have to worry about nada (No)
Your my Gucci, Louis, my Prada
If you were my girl
You'd be the top of the line in my Phantom
The perfect things you'd have 'em
Top of the Line

The way that you walk girl (Way that you walk girl)
It's top of the line
You'd be my everything
Top of the line
