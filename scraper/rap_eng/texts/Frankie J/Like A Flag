Move your body, body like a flag
Move your body, body like a flag

Super too, this loving around the world, tonight is me and you
So let's go, we've only got now, so girl
Let me show you what to do
That's in another stars, Miami to Katar
Move wherever you are

Move your body, body like a flag
Baila, baila conmigo tonight
Move your body, body like a flag
Gonna dance for the rest of my life!

Dj
One more chance, I'm holding you close tonight
We might get just one chance
To live free, your body just feels so right
But baby give it up to me!
That's in another star
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Miami to Katar
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Move wherever you are!
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Moving like that!

Move your body, body like a flag
Baila, baila conmigo tonight
Move your body, body like a flag
Gonna dance for the rest of my life!
Moving like that!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Moving like that!
Dj
Move your body, body like a flag
Baila, baila conmigo tonight
Baila, baila conmigo tonight
Moving like that!
