Hey
Oh, yeah
(Better get it right)

Oh
Oh, yeah
(Better get it right)

[Chorus:]
Better get it right
Don't wanna be your part time lover
Better get it right
If you want my love for sure
Better get it right

[Verse 1:]
Don't wanna be another number
Cause you and me go together, boy
You know I make it right for you

Because I certainly adore you
I got your back
You notice that
I'm holding it down
(For you)
I'm always here
When you need me
I give the best to my baby

I get it right
I want it right
Baby, can you feel me?

[Pre-Chorus:]
I really wanna be your only
I'm not just trying to be your homie
And you could be the one to hold me
When I'm lonely inside, yeah

You could be the one to touch me
And you could be the one to love me
And you could be the one to kiss me
Better get it right
Yeah

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
I give you all of my sweetness
It's sad to say you're my weakness
I give it up
All that I have
So everything is for you

If I could be the only girl
We can get it right
I'm telling you, boy
Right now
Just let me be the one

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Max Minelli]
You got issues
Cause I make pimp moves
And I break your heart

And you need tissues
Cause I make you cry
And I know you try
You say bye-bye

Can't lie
I die
And now my situation
In the air like a pop fly

Should you let go
Or should you hold on
One day
I promise
I'mma put a smile on your face
I left a trace of my cologne on your pillowcase

You wanna teach
And I gotta get money from dishing
And your broken heart needs a' fixing

But you don't
Super woman
X-ray vision
You look inside me
And see my mission to get it right

I really wanna be your only
I'm not just trying to be your homie
And you could be the one to hold me
While I'm lonely inside
(Yeah)

You could be the one to touch me
And you could be the one to love me
And you could be the one to kiss me
Get it right
Yeah

[Repeat Chorus:]
