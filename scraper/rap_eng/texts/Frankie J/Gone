Damn...I miss you
MMM...ooh

I toss and turn...it's so hard for me to sleep
I guess I'm no used to being alone...yeah
And I know it's because of me
And I'm trying to face this reality
Past relations they've made me into this man that I am
Knowing now that it's wrong
It's too late cuz she's gone

Gone...gone...gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone...gone...gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly
Being strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it she's gone...gone

This house is cold
It's like doing time in the pen
Wondering where she is and who she with...yeah
But the hardest thing is there's no one else to blame but me
So I guess I have to take it like a man
But I don't know if I'll ever love again
Yeah...yeah

Cuz this pain I'm feeling inside is like a hollow point through my heart
I know that it's kinda crazy
But I feel like I'm falling apart
Usually I'm so cool, but I lost it when
She walked away
Lost without her...and she's gone

Gone...gone...gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone...gone...gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly
Being strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it she's gone...gone

Without some kind of intervention
I can't go on another day...oh
And I can't even bare to mention
The very sound of her name
Without the sky turnin into clouds
Without the rain falling down
Falling down...again...again
I can't face the fact that she's gone

Gone...gone...gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone...gone...gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly
Being strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it she's gone...gone
