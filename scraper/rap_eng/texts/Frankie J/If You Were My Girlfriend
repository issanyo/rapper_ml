So glad I found you
So glad I found you girl
So glad I found you
If you were my...

Everytime I see you, in the mall, doing your thing girl
I be up in your business, like baby, can I please get your number?
Let me pick you up, we can fall on the weekend
I be out in my hummer
Chicky-dit-ta with you
If you were mine...
Can I get a chance with you
I just wanna dance with you
And maybe just maybe we can go do what we do
I'm feelin you girl
Tell you what I would do

If you were my girlfriend
I'll lift you up
I won't tie you down
I'll give you, my heart
If you were my girlfriend
I'll always be true
Right by your side
If you were my boo
If you were my girlfriend
I'll lift you up
I won't tie you down
I'll give you, my heart
If you were my girlfriend
I'll always be true
Right by your side
If you were my boo

Shorty

Now I got the contact, Imma use it
& I holla
But all I seem to get is your voicemail
Or a ring-ring-ring-ring
It gets kinda crazy
Cuz everytime I see you
You be up in my face like the wife of my dreams
So what I do?
Can I get a date with you?
I wanna escape with you...
& maybe, just maybe, we can go do what we do...
Cuz I'm feeling you girl
Lemme tell you what I would do...

If you were my girlfriend
I'll lift you up
I won't tie you down
I'll give you, my heart
If you were my girlfriend
I'll always be true
Right by your side
If you were my boo
If you were my girlfriend
I'll lift you up
I won't tie you down
I'll give you, my heart
If you were my girlfriend
I'll always be true
Right by your side
If you were my boo

If you were my girlfriend there won't be no drama
Cuz I'll never put you on that
But it seems like them cats youve been choosing on lately
Don't know how to treat you with glad

If you were my girlfriend
I'll lift you up
I won't tie you down
I'll give you, my heart
If you were my girlfriend
I'll always be true
Right by your side
If you were my boo
If you were my girlfriend
I'll lift you up
I won't tie you down
I'll give you, my heart
If you were my girlfriend
I'll always be true
Right by your side
If you were my boo
