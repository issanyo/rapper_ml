1st Verse:
Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesnt wanna do
Do i live my life with you as my wife?
Or do i go on and pursue my lifetime dream?
I gotta do this for me
Cuz if I dont I'll probably regret it
But if I do I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

CHORUS:
How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And theres nothin you can do about it
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it though its heart-breakin'
Its somethin that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live..
How do I deal without you

2nd Verse:
Its killing me to know
That your heart's with me
But you're with him cuz I chose to be
In this industry
Money, shows and hoes come along with
Luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it
But this is the life
That I was given
So i have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime
Without you

[Chorus]

SOLO:
How do you deal when
You can't be with the one you love
And the one that you love is with somebody else
(I don't know, I don't know)
And what do you do
When you know she don't love him
And she loves me but she just can't stand loving you far away
(I guess I'm gonna have to just)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want to have to live with it)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(no, no, no)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else loving you)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else loving me)

[Chorus 2X]
