Verse 1
I can't believe u had the nerve to say the things u said
They hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it ..4 years go down the drain
Oh how i wish things would of happened so differently
I tryd to save it so many times but you still couldn't see
U kept insistin and resistin that u would not fall again
And now u tryin to tell me that ur sorry
And ur tryin to come back home
Ur tellin me u really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
But baby i

-Chorus
Dont wanna try dont wanna try dont wanna try no more
U keep insisting when u know our love is out the door
Dont wanna try dont wanna try cuz all we do is fight and say the things
I hurt u bad to when we both begin to cry
Dont wanna try dont wanna try i bout just had enough its been a rough road
Baby just let it go
Dont wanna try dont wanna try dont wanna try no more
Tell me whats the use of holdin on when all we do is hurt our love

Verse 2
U and i had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up face reality
It all just seem to good to be true after all you put me through
And now u tryin to tell me that ur sorry
And u tryin to come back home
U tellin me that u really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
But baby i

-Chorus
Dont wanna try dont wanna try dont wanna try no more
U keep insisting when u know our love is out the door
Dont wanna try dont wanna try cuz all we do is fight and say the things
I hurt u bad to when we both begin to cry
Dont wanna try dont wanna try i bout just had enough its been a rough road
Baby just let it go
Dont wanna try dont wanna try dont wanna try no more
Tell me whats the use of holdin on when all we do is hurt our love
