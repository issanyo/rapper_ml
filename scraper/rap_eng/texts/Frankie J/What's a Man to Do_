I planned my getaway
Cuz my shorty,she was trippin
Just trying to get out
Breathe a little air
If you know what i mean yeah

So as i'm jumpin out the window of my room...
I hear my homies callin out
They're on the move
Driven escalades and hummers with them blades
Hiding behind shades,ready on thier way.. yeah..
(it's how we roll..)
So as we drivin, we ended up on da strip
We see some hunnies (and damn!)
I just began to flip..
Cuz this shorty she be staring straight at me
This sexy fine lady.. she be callin me out now..

Whats a man to do

Whats a man to say..
When shorty's just drivin you insane..
Whats a man to do ..
When you and your girl
Just can't pull through..damn..

When everything just ain't the same..

See i'm trying to find a way out of this mistery
Cuz only god knows this is not the way i be
I'm just to young to be stressin this ain't right for me
So she better act up
Or i'm gonna straight up and leave...
This is not the first time
That we go through this...
It's 'bout the second, third, fourth, maybe even fifth
And i've been trying to work it out
Only with you babe...
So just listen because not all men are the same...

Almost everything i can
So let me learn you something
And you better learn right quick
