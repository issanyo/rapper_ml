When I look at you baby
I see a shinning star
But when you look in the mirror girl
You don’t know who you are

You give yourself no credit
For all the things you’ve done
Just look at the blessings
And all you’ve got

[Chorus:]
You’re beautiful and wonderful
Incredible and vibrant
Like a miracle so spiritual
Like an angel in disguise

The way you love is parable
It physically excites me
I can just go on and on of you
Of how beautiful you are

Well last night I heard you speak
So silent in your sleep
Spilling all your worries on your pillow girl
I can even feel you wink

Sweet child those tears are wasting

Just wipe them all away
Replace them with my kisses
As you gone here me say

[Chorus:]
You’re beautiful and wonderful
Incredible and vibrant
Like a miracle so spiritual
Like an angel in disguise

The way you love is parable
It physically excites me
I can just go on and on of you
Of how beautiful you are

[Chorus:]
You’re beautiful and wonderful
Incredible and vibrant
Like a miracle so spiritual
Like an angel in disguise

The way you love is parable
It physically excites me
I can just go on and on of you
Of how beautiful you are
