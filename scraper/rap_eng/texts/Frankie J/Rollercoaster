[Verse 1]
I could be yours, you could be mine
We can do whatever it is that you like
We can take it slow, we can take our time
We can do anything, anywhere
You don't need a ticket, don't need to get in line
Take my hand and we can grace the sky tonight
Higher than the towers, just leave it all behind
Not even the stars can match your shine

[Chorus]
I'm coming closer, let's go ahead, enjoy this ride
Roller coaster, I know we gonna love tonight
When it's over, you gonna wanna say again
And I'll promise that I'll never let it end

[Verse 2]
Lay back for a second, leave it up to me
Been waiting for this moment, like to set you free
Forget about your makeup, you're beautiful to me
Cause where we're going, you ain't gotta wear a thing
Feel that wind in your hair
Trust that I will get you there
Just enjoy me
As I enjoy you

[Chorus]
I'm coming closer, let's go ahead, enjoy this ride
Roller coaster, I know we gonna love tonight
When it's over, you gonna wanna say again
And I'll promise that I'll never let it end

[Outro]
Roller coaster
Roller coaster
Roller coaster
Roller coaster
