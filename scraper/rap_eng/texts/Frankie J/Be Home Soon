Hello sweetheart, so how was your day
Well I'm just sittin here
Thinkin of you...
I feel like I'm a go crazy...

I can't stand no other minute
Away from your heart
I just wanna get on
The first plane home
And head straight into your arms
Yeah...

I know you miss me shorty
I'm missin you too...
So I swear and I promise
That I will be there
That I'll be home soon...baby, yeah

Chorus:
I'll be home soon...
It's just these phone conversations
Ain't helpin our relation
And I'd rather be there with you oh ...

I'll be home soon...
It's just these times got me stressin
And I haven't been so patient
Cuz I'd rather be there with you oh...

Listen now darlin...
Don't you worry 'bout a thang
I know it hasn't been
Easy for you babe
But I know we're gonna make it
Through this rain yeah...
Sometimes my job gets crazy
And it's hard for me too
But I've got too work hard
No matter the cost
And I do it all for you baby yeah...

Now I know you miss me shorty
Cuz I'm missin you too...
So I swear and I promise
That I will be there
That I'll be home soon...yeah

I'll be home soon..
(oh, you know that I'll be home with ya baby)
It's just these phone conversations
Ain't helping our relations
And I'd rather be there with you...
(I would rather, I would rather be there eith you)

I'll be home soon...
(I can't wait to see your pretty face baby)
It's just these times got me stressing
And I haven't been so patient
Cuz I'd rather be there with you
(I'm so confused, I'm still missing you baby)
(I'm still missing you, and I know we're gonna be together, together, together baby)
