Yeah, Yeah, I ain't trippin' oh yeah
First day at work, I met you
You laid your pretty eyes on me (me)
Right then I knew it be something
I didn't know what it could be
So I, asked if you had a man and you showed me the ring on your hand
The look on your face, when I asked you for your name
Your expression said it all to me, yeah
I can't deny, you stayed on my mind
Too bad I got a girl and you can't be mine
But damn you're so fine (fine)
I think it's worth a try, so girl let's just get down

I won't tell, if you won't tell
I'm trying to keep it on the low
Cause if he finds out and she finds out
You know it's gonna end for sure
Its gonna end for sure baby

Even though you got a man (man)
And even though I got a girl (girl)
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin')
I like the way it's going down

Even though you got a man (man)
And even though I got a girl (girl)
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin')
I like the way it's going down

When we went out on our first date (first date)
I remember it was Thursday (Thursday) (yeah)
It was the day before we got paid (We got paid)
And I can't front, I dint know what to say (nah)

It was supposed to be business, that's what we both said
We had some drinks and ended up in a hotel bed
I really hope this doesn't get around
So keep it on the low and we can keep on getting down

I know we crossed the line when we got down girl (down girl)
But how could something wrong feel oh so right (so right)
We both got down so don't say nothing
You know I'll be around do a lil' something
Me and you, you and getting down (getting down)

Even though you got a man (man)
And even though I got a girl (girl)
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin')
I like the way it's going down

Even though you got a man (man)
And even though I got a girl (girl)
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin')
I like the way it's going down

Even though you got a man (man)
And even though I got a girl (girl)
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin')
I like the way it's going down

Even though you got a man (man)
And even though I got a girl (girl)
It is what it's gonna be (I ain't trippin')
I like the way it's going down
