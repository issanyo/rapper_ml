Yo, I wanna dedicate this song to everyone out there
Who's goin' through the same thing, just keepin it real, listen
Well, she was five foot, three, unique with them brown eyes
So beautiful that I had to make her my wife
I put my trust in her, I had a kid with her
I thought that I would be happy till the end with her
So you live an' learn, that's what you had told me
And now I'm feeling so miserable and lonely
I should've listened to your words
I should've listened to your words
From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation, I be goin' through
From a friend to a friend, you would say the truth
From the outside looking in
She wasn't good at all, I thought that she loved me
She wasn't good at all, I really, really thought she cared
She wasn't good at all, how could I have been such a fool
To never listen to your words, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I should've never, never, never stayed with her, yeah
I told you from the beginning about this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same
Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls
These type of girls they come and go
Remember when we told 'em about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it
From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation you was goin' through
From a friend to a friend, I would say the truth
From the outside looking in
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know you knew but I never listened to you, no
She wasn't good at all, you know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all, I should've listened to your words
Yo, we must of had a different vision of love, tender kisses and hugs
Makin' me weak in my knees, that's how vicious it was
I'm from the gutter girl, you know it's vicious for thugs
Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us
I used to miss you so much, I put the pimp aside
Broke all my criminal ties, gave you the simple life
Call me the family man, gettin' my salary tight
But soon as you drop your guard, that's when reality bites
And leave a open wound, greed got your cover blown
But I be over you, I'm solitary born
I should of listened an' my boy and I would'd known
You do your thang, I ain't concerned, baby, girl I'm gone
She wasn't good at all, I knew she wasn't good enough
She wasn't good at all, I knew but I didn't care, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know I did this to myself
I know I did this to myself
She wasn't good at all, I tried to warn you 'bout this kinda of girl
She wasn't good at all, I just was so blind by her love
Or at least I thought it was love, yeah
Ooh, on and on
She wasn't good at all
She wasn't good at all, yeah, yeah
I said I'm glad she's out of my life
