Woooaaaoooo ahhwhoooo
Wooooaaooo ahhwhooo yeahh aayy

When I walk into this spot and I see your face again
Butterflies in my stomach and my heart jumps out my chest
I feel like telling that something, but my mind is telling me to stop (me to stop)
'Cause my body is in a state of shock
I turn around and I tell my boys "That's the chick I've been talking 'bout"
I'm getting nervous 'cause I think she's noticing me now

I've never seen a girl like this before
And I've been around the world on tour
Got a picture on my mind
I think I'm running out of time

I got a crush on you, and you don't even know
Do you even notice me when I walk through the door?
Don't even know your name, or if we're compatible
Gotta build me up some courage baby and just let you know
I gotta letcha know, I gotta letcha know
That your pretty lil smile is incredible
I gotta letcha know, I gotta letcha know
'Cause until the day I do, I'm just invisible

I got a crush, on youuuu
I got a crush, on youuuu
I got a crush, on youuuu
I got a crush, on youuuu

I never had a crush like this (NO!!)
Gotta get a number your, excuse me miss! (Yeaah)
Listen up miss and tell your boy "what can I help you with?" (Help you with)
I said you were beautiful girl
I like what you workin' with (Workin' with)
She said "I got a man, but thanks for the complement"
Well I hope you happy girl, he's such a lucky man (Lucky man)
Thank you much, you're such a gentlemen
And I noticed you too, hope I see you again boooo

I've never seen a girl like this before
And I've been around the world on tour

Wish that I can make a move right now, but I can'tttt
Wanna tell her what I'm feeling, tell her what I'm feeling
