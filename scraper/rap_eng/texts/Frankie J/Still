I got a call late last night from a number I didn't know
It was so strange I knew who it was from the moment she said hello
And I paused for a minute
I couldn't believe it
I kept my cool so my girl just wouldn't see She said, "I'm sorry but there's something you should know"
This is what she said to me

"I didn't let you go
No I can't let you go"
She said, "I'm having such a hard time"
Then I heard, "I didn't let you go
I just can't let you go"
And then she said, "I think I'm loosing my mind

"'Cause I still love you
This I must confess
I guess I still need you
I feel I have to tell you this again
Yes I still want you
Oh these words I did not plan
So if I've interupted anything
I promise I won't call you again"

So I told her my heart felt
The same that it did before (as it did before)
Its never changed
My feelings never went away girl (no)
My heart never closed the door (no, no it never closed the door)
Then I stopped for a minute gotta think about my lady
And what we have going on (what we have going on)
She's about to have my baby
Girl, you waited much to long

I gotta let you go
I'm haning up the phone
This conversation can't go on no more
I gotta let you go
'Cause if I don't let you go
I fear that I met let you know

'Cause I still love you
This I must confess
I guess I still need you
I feel I have to tell you this again
Yes I still want you
Oh these words I did not plan
So if I interupted anything
I promise I won't call you again

Now I'm doing just fine with my girl
Not about to let her go (can't let her go, let her go)
Just because you find me once again it doesn't mean you're coming back home (doesn't mean youre coming back home) Now its been about 2 years or so (its been about 2 years)
Since we went our separate ways (went our separate ways)
You gotta face the fact we're over with and done
'Cause I

'Cause I still love you
This I must confess, Baby
I guess I still need you
I feel I have to tell you this again, Baby
Yes I still want you
Oh these words I did not plan
So if I interupted anything
I promise I won't call you again

'Cause I still love you (cause I still l, I still love you Baby)
Yes I still need you (but I better not talk about it cuz I rather move on with my life and do what I gotta do)
Yes I still want you (im sorry Baby)
You gotta move on
So if I interupted anything
I promise I won't call you again

I promise I won't call you ever again
