(You must be crazy)

[ VERSE 1 ]
One day, let's just say that I was bored
I went for a ride in my new Accord
Sucker MC's were standin outside
Talkin bout, "Yo Ed, let me get a ride"
I said, "You're already ridin on mine"
He raised his tone, and out came the chrome from behind
(Better back up, nigga) "Now continue with yourself
And don't step any further, cause it's bad for your health
And your wealth and your future
Cause I don't wanna have to shoot ya" - (booya!)
And then I went into the store
I wanted some chips, it's a dollar for 4
I gotta get some juice and a loosey
I used to smoke, now it's only 1 or 2, see?
I'm not a bad guy, but I got bad habits
I was raised in the place where they grab it
If they want it (Brooklyn) but I'm not a thief
Plus I'm not a punk, so don't pop junk or beef
What?
You must be crazy

I pay for the goods and I make my exit
I walked out the door, and I saw some legs, it
Looked like cheese that I knew
]From around the way or maybe from my brother Drew
It can't be the rest, because the others are older
Looked like a nice slice, tapped her on the shoulder
(Excuse me) She turned around, started to stare
Grabbed at my hat, said, "Let me see your hair!"
I said, "There won't be none of that, at least not here"
She said, "My man is always snoring, and he's boring"
I said, "So what? You're out here whoring?
What you think you're doing?
I ain't tryin to ruin no relationship
Honey dip, get a grip"
Cause that's the kinda fan I can't stand
When she wanna get wreck and still got a man
So if you got a girl, you better watch her
Because love is blind (got that ass) gotcha

(Think I'm crazy)

Well now, I got around the way and I just couldn't wait
(Why?) Today mom said that she was cookin peppered steak
I parked the ride, and as I stride down the ave
I said, "Oh my, what big thighs you have"
To a slice of cheese and cut-off shorts
She said, "Ain't you Special Ed?," I said, "But of course
But that's not the matter at hand
Do you have a man? Do you understand?
What I'm tryin to say is, well, ??? I'm a little shy
She said, "Why, you're an attractive guy
Plus I seen your videos, all four of them
Can I be in one of them if you have more of them?"
I said, "Yes, there's one next week
Come to the crib so we can speak"
She came over 3 days later
And I laid her
