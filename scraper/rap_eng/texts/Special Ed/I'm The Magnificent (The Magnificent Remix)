I am the magnificent!
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute
'Cause I get in it like a car and drive
And if the record is smash, I can still survive
I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin'
Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin'
You might not understand what I'm saying at first
So Action Love, put it in reverse

I'm just conversin' with you, person
This is just a conversation
I'm Special Ed, with the special presentation, hey
I like to play, so for me it's recreaton
It's not just a job, it's an adventure
If worse comes to worse, I've got your thirst quencher
But ya gotta buy it, dont' even try it
I don't rhyme for free, no matter how dry it gets
I collect my money in sets
One before the show and again when I jet
So I get mine, and I'm a get more
'Cause I'm financially secure and I'm sure
So i don't need your tips or advice
'cause I'm too nice for that, you rat
I can't stand mice, I'm like a cat, kinda frisky
Battling is risky business
You might acquire dizziness, just like whisky
Isn't this enough?
Oh, you think you're tough, cookie
I think you better call your bookie
'Cause you can bet your life, that I'm gonna play you like hooky
On a Friday, this is my day
When I was through, I heard you say, Why they dis me like that?
I shoulda repent
Somebody shoulda said that Special Ed was the magnificent

I am the magnificent
I'm the magnificent, dynamite, super dope, outta sight
Special Ed with my trusty pal
Action Love, the run we shall
Continue to win you, yet this is not a game
But I'm 'a play you if say you claim to be better
I hate rumors and I give tumors
And our jammies get Grammys
Yet I'm not an actor, it's just a factor that we're famous
So don't blame us for nothin'
Action Love is cuttin', I'm on the rhyme
Skin your teeth and it's your beef that I'll grind
Like a butcher, I'll put you on a table
And let my D.J. cut ya
But you're such a little sucker
I might not even touch ya
I betcha whatcha want is just attention
Your mother and your father shoulda used some prevention
Look at all the time and the money they spent
And now ya wanna die against I-the magnificent?
I am the magnificent!
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute
'Cause I get in it like a car and drive
And if the record is smash, I can still survive
I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin'
Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin'
You might not understand what I'm saying at first
So Action Love, put it in reverse
