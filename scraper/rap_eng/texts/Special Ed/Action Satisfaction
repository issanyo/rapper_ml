[Verse 1: Zaakir]
I see dead man grins
The seven deadly sins
Couldn't keep his mouth closed in the house of the chins
The all seeing eye that recognize the rap clones
Plus possess the pin to crack the pyramid stone
Its the call of the wild that's why my words rank high
Drop a verse for nine planets
That fell from the sky
Do or die you and I can fly with rap expressions
With the one two three four five

[Verse 2: Chali 2na]
In the session with the lesson
Cause in treble and bass we trust
With the rebels orally ready in case we bust
And write a power cause and ruckus if the place be plush
We kick the old school like Julio Iglesius
Tapes we push be straps with no safety catch
We attack like a bullet till your face relax
And think about it
If you ain't got the class to flee
Be mentally ready for jurass-catastrophy

[Verse 3: Mark 7even]
Now it's time for me to rise
The lyric utilizer
Down like fertilizer
Quick to improvise
A style that can surprise ya
Your eyes is on the prize
We can go line for line
I ain't hard to find
While we break your spine
My mild style reclines
I'm laid back
All that talk you need to save that
The payback, is all the reason that I'm flexing
The feds rocking like we x-men

[Hook: Everyone]
You say you want action satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long long while

You say you want action satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long long while

[Verse 4: Akil]
From set
Who's up next to pull a fast one
Lyrically connect the dot and then I blast one
Now who wants action satisfaction
Lyrics remind you of bass I'm everlasting
Casting plagues my styles to crossing switchblades
My momma shoulda named me grace cause I'm amazingly
Blazing with the fire and desire
I'm world renowned I gets down to the wire

[Verse 5: Chali 2na]
If any child of mine get out a line boastin'
My style of rhyme covers you like calamine lotion
Lifted like out of vine motion I spend time stroking
Used to drink a dime potion and dime boasting
But now my rhymes open brims a spirituality
We be giving power that you can share with your family
Aerodynamically cutting through danger
Ripping your narrow mentality nothing but flavor

[Hook: Everyone]
You say you want action satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long long while

You say you want action satisfaction
It's the J5 jurassic, not the Jackson 5
We alive and well, unify rebel
Set the vibe only time will tell

(By the way you say you want satisfaction)
What-what-what, what, action
(By the way you say you want satisfaction)
A little action
(By the way you say you want satisfaction)
Postitive, action
(By the way you say you want satisfaction)

[Verse 6: Everyone]
The moral of my oral ammunition rendition
2na fishin, I be doing Marc 7even collision
We be forever keeping niggas on they P's and Q's
And then the B's who snooze leave diseased and bruised
I see through your crews like an x-ray tube
And gamma rayed your function
Left you with assumption
That we be the butter clique
We smothered with the action satisfaction guaranteed to be jurassic

[Hook: Everyone]
You say you want action satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long long while

You say you want action satisfaction
The brothers with the positive reaction
The crew with the style that's on top of the pile
J5's gonna rock a long long while
