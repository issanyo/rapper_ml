[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm back because I never did front
Everybody act like it's that time of the month
Because you beef about this then you beef about that
With all of the beef, I get you think I would be fat
But, my metabolism rate goes quicker
'Cause I am a slim, trim, smooth city slicker
I don't perpetrate to be the great or royal
Just shake the hands and the fans stay loyal
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Yo, come here, baby, and let me unbutton your button
Stop frontin' 'cause I want you, I do
Then get your friend 'cause I want her too
Is it possible? Do you think that we could swing it?
If you like the song, come along and sing it
Appreciate the music, that is what it's here for
Therefore, come on, everybody cheer for
The super technological, extracurricular
Adjacent right angles are also perpendicular
I could teach you from what I know in my head
I'm Special Ed

[Verse 2]
Get your microphone check, 1, 2, and I say to you
How many records do I have to play to you
For you to realize who is the pro in this profession?
'Cause I speak and seek for self-progression
Look at what's happening, I'm not rappin'
I'm just statin' what I'm creatin'
Vocals and percussion, rushin'
Blood to your head which causes flushin'
Your face is pink and getting red
Now you've got the curse of a verse of a
Special Ed rhyme, 'cause I'm on
So turn up the juice 'cause I'ma get loose, word is bond
Chumps try to pose to flex
But I can kick a rhyme battle, break your nose the next
But I don't wanna hurt you or beat you
But, try to diss and I'll dismiss and defeat you
'Cause that's a game that I do not play
No, I wasn't brought up or taught that way
So don't try to tell me what I know already
Plus you don't know me so don't call me Eddie
It's Special, so get it in your head
Especially when the Special is me
'Cause I'm Special Ed

[Verse 3]
And ya don't stop because I just won't let you do it
I know you bit my rhyme because I saw you start to chew it
Just like some, gum, Bubble Yum
Go ahead, 'cause I'm Special Ed and I'm ready
They used to call me Crazy Eddie
Because I couldn't be beat nor overtaken
Years have gone by and I am still making
More and more, and just like a store, it sells
Like she sells seashells, down by the seashore
But I won't preach about a beach, I just came to reach
And take your mind, kinda like a reminder
Don't you remember who is the finder or who was the founder?
I was around a long time ago but now you know
And knowing is half the battle
But understanding is the other, go ask your mother if you don't
And if don't then you won't
Why stay hidden in the dark?
Because you might get bitten, forget the bark
'Cause yo, I just rush and bust a rhyme that could splatter
'Cause it doesn't matter
I could bust another or the other instead
'Cause I'm Special Ed
