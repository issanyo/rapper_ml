[Intro - Special Ed]
Yo it's on right?
Yooo! and you don't stop, what's up y'all?
Yo this is Special Ed and we chillin' out here in the basement
Rockin' it live in Flatbush
We got Howie Tee behind the boards
We got my brother Wayne over there sittin' down
We got Little Shawn sittin' down
We got 40 sittin' down
We got my brother Drew sittin' down
We got DJ Akshun
We got DJ Akshun
[?], yo, what I'ma do right, I'ma let my boys get a little loose on this track right here
So first on the mic is my man Drew, so you can do whatcha like

[Verse 1 - Drew Archer]
I consume and digest and take a rest
Pack my mic, then strap my vest
Onto war, sound the charge of the brigade
I'm ready to battle, state and get paid
Dropping bodies like [?] so watch your back
'Cause I'm strapped and I'm ready to attack
In fact, you lack the skills to get ill
So I crushed you on sight with the scope to kill
On target, I might just bust without discuss
Watch the bloodbath, no man can take this much fury
When I'm on a jewel heist
But I don't steal jewels I just get [?] on the mic
Visit to create the scene
Brought to you from Drew and dope team
This is how I let off steam so make way
Yo 40, tell 'em what you gotta say

[Verse 2 - 40 Love]
How many times must I pull the trigger?
My rhyme is automatic so now it's kinda figure
Should I release a masterpiece of my music?
You heard it once before so don't you confuse it
40-Love the name and Brooklyn's the back up
Lived here all my life so don't try to act up
Play this game for keeps I only got one shot
Plan to make it good or I lose my spot
My rhyming skills served as my sixth sense
With the lyric lashing breaks down your defense
Go for 40 days and 40 nights
Drink the 40 dog, had 40 fights
MCs come in all different types
But they don't know, don't believe the hype
Once I touch the mic you better save you breathe
'Cause you just faked the final sense of death
Kick a couple of rhymes now it's time to be gone
Next on the mic is my man Little Shawn

[Verse 3 - Little Shawn]
Get, get up out your seats, let's begin
'Cause I'm the L-I-double T-L-E-S-H-A-W-N
Just give me a pen, I'll fill it to the rim or until you say when
The rhymes I write are hyped up for your pleasure
The styles I use change up like the weather
Tall and good looking if I may say so
I don't joke or kid or play although I know
Some might say I possess a sense of humor
The fact that I'm bad on the mic is not a rumor
Any mistakes that I make will be corrected
'Cause when the mic's in my hand I'm respected
'Cause no one is half the MC that I am
'Cause I'm hot, potent and fly, superb and [?] and oh
'Cause you know a lot of rappers talk junk and yes
On the mic they flunk 'cause Little Shawn got funk
And on the microphone I'm fed
Last but not least is the man Special Ed

[Verse 4 - Special Ed]
I don't know where to start so I will where I am
Sittin' in my chair as I prepare another jam
Not a jam sandwich but another man which can
Lyrically withstand an attack
Verbally, I'm superbly packed
WIth vitamins E and D
Take 'em and you might feel like but you can't be like me
'Cause there is only one like the one sun in the solar system
'Cause I revolve and twist 'em
Into pretzel, like figures of flesh
That's what happens when you figure you're fresh
And then 'fess
Now clean up the mess
Now send it back to sender if you remember the address
Just hop back in your box
Tell 'em where you live and someone knocks
Because when you positively got to be there overnight
Try to battle, I'ma cook ya then book ya flight
I know I shouldn't help out a sucker MC
'Cause I'm a frequent fly ya so I fly miles for free
And ya don't stop!

Yo, yo, yo, yo Ed, yo Ed it ain't over yet
Ak gotta get some, you thought I couldn't rhyme?
Check this out

[Verse 5 - DJ Akshun]
At first, I put your rhymes to a hold stop
Go for your jugular vein, take out your voicebox
Leave you speechless 'cause you can't beat this
Have a seat 'cause I'm about to teach this
So say your last goodbyes 'cause nothing can save ya
Get on your knees, bow your head and pray ya
I'm like the mafia I give you a kiss and that's my sign...and your deathwish
Actions are warrior, I would do more of ya
One, two, three, or four of ya, don't care if I know of ya
An opportunity like this I can't pass up
Give me the microphone and I'ma light that ass up
'Cause I'm hittin' hard in 1990
And funky would be the best word to describe me
You can ask any brother am I hypin' it?
And simply reply, you're damn right
Put your mic down boys, save that chit-chat
'Cause yo true, you could get a big smack

[Outro - Special Ed]
Yeah that's why I'm sayin'
Cause you know we ain't playin'
My man Ak
My man 40 Love
My man Little Sean
My man the brother Drew, my brother Drew
My brother Wayne in the house
Howie Tee is in the house
I'm in the mizza-fucking house
And yo, it's like that, peace
