[Verse 1]
See it ya
When me-a chat, you know it's that
You didn't have to respond
Put this in my video send me it
Fear of James Bond
I float on the boat, 'pon water and land
Come back in a different style
I know you can't understand
Come when me chat upon the mic
Jah knows upon the version
Is my selector DJ Action?
'Cause it don't matter what them do
Want it, don't matter what they say
'Cause when it gets away
Them mice them all go play
But it never know say that
Me coded the chat this way
Through I was born in Brooklyn
But the rest are from J.A
I know we all live in America today
I saw my dem and I say, this and that
But if me catch you boy
You and your posse are go flat
Then don't get me vexed
'Cause I will take out my frustration
And you will hear the sound
Of a round of radication
Pure shot of liq, but a pure shot I bust
'Cause me not know the dred
But then I Jah Jah, trust me
'Cause these are the workings of the lord
Yes, my selector action pull up
And come in a different style and fashion
Mine like cool it, come from flashin' culture lyrics
So see it ya

[Verse 2]
Lord love is mercy
They call it man and I live party
Everybody come listen me, lord
They come and do a little things, but me cold chill
Me know a little things, but me call 'cha
Me name they call me money, is a bon rasta
Me come from the country boy, when them call Juda
Where emblem complete with three meedra colla
Miss a red, green and gold, make me proud sir
The red is for the blood where we shed, ay yah
Where the black people shed when an evil man massacre
The green is for the trees
Where spring up from the earth-cha
It fed me, it from a dum child in earth-cha
The goal is for the son created by the father
Is a necessary element for our survival
The alien of the near, shine them, say "A Ganja"
It bring wisdom and knowledge and also power
Me say don't know to watch a J
They lick the child away
And when them finished, don't look in them eye
Them red like fire
Then them run to me, and start figgin' my leg-cha
And say when Jesus walk the earth
He drop them as a preacher
And teaching in the temple through the scribes of elder
Him teach them 'bout the one, who them call Lucifer
When him kneel upon the cross, imagine oh him so far
As I call a man, come forgive him a cold-cha
'Cause I know any MC can't talk like me
Come here I owe them a tactical rip
And me no gonna stand many people
And rock while I smokin' 'em out
Smile them and back
The smooth jam master, don't put a big rock on
Part of see, which I wanna talk Jamaican
I land and deffen 'em up with no food like cherry sores
I banna mango and coconut some drink
Come on, now that sound trife it yah
Bum!
