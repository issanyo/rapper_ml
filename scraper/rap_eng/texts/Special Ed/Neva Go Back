[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' restless, what guest list?
I'm rushin' the percussion, end of discussion
Now, as you were, you rhyme soft like fur
Oh, you write for her? Now, that explain it
But I reign it, I rule it, so cool it, while I school it
Listen, to precision
Rhymin', timin', climbin' through your window
(Crooklyn style!) And we in, yo
Ravagin' your whole premises, don't never diss
'Cause here's your address
'Cause mi bad, yes, so come test me now
Like Patra, I got it sewn like Sinatra
Organized crime in effect, snap that neck
Like E-Double if there be trouble
So, move on, there's nothin' to see here
Clear the area, your rhymes are dead
Get the burier to bury ya, I'm very effective, I might add
Original rude, since I was a little lad

[Hook x2]
I neva go back, I neva flow wack
I just come back, I just come phat

[Verse 2]
I'm pumpin' like Donovan, plus, I'm a little vicious
I eat MC's 'cause they delicious
It's just that some mistrust but I dust rhymes like a maid
Now, I'm back with How', stompin' like a parade
All up and down Fifth Ave, so if you riff, have plenty of back
'Cause I attack like blood cells, fightin' off diseased MC's
Like Super Friends, in a metropolis, in a super Benz
With Howie, now we got two threes
Fuck it, six, gimme the mix and I'm a kill 'em with the lyrics
So, dig a plot and nigga got, seven
Never doubt, I go all out, salida
You need a map, you need a rap
You need a slap, you need a nap
So, take one, because you're tired
I get so phat, I feel wired
But I never sell, or fall 'cause I never fell

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I don't beg, I break your leg like an egg and fry it
Try it, and see what happens when I'm rappin'
Shit start so Get Smart like Max
'Cause cold hard facts prevail, I don't fail
I don't turn pale but I'm very ill, I'm fatal
I rock rhymes like a cradle
Many days, many ways, let me count 'em
Everybody that I caught, everybody thought
But but (bu-bu-but), don't stutter
Just say it, shit is butter
Now, don't that feel better? Get a sweater
'Cause it's gettin' colder, every time I hold a
Mic, niggas freeze up so ease up like, off the scrotum
'Cause you wrote 'em, like you know them
So, let me show them, real rhyme
'Cause I feel I might start buggin' if you don't back up off the mic
The lyrical war is on, and so I strike

[Hook x4]
