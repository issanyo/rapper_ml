You know what time it is kid

Sucka MCs please think twice
I'm to nice kid I'm just to nice

Step into your BI, GI
Thought you was a lot better, or atleast a little smarter
I beat you like your father, when he drunk
I see your eye shurnk, so what up punk
You wanna try me, this ain't a taste test
I'm already best, I never press
You a small thing when I'm walking
You get stepped on, as I slip on
My name is Ed Notbed so I'm never to be slept on
I got you sleepless, peep this, fuck that
And make 'em bleep this
It dont matter, you know my stee
Special Ed, Evil Dead, E.D
Anyway, my skills are never to be questioned
I shoot you down like a western, and make you chest burn
You smell death, you fell to your left
Now you stagger, you hold on but it don't matter

[Chorus 2x]
Sucka MCs please think twice
I'm to nice kid I'm just to nice

Open your brain to the rain
I'm lyrically trained to shame
So don't blame, yourself
It ain't your fault I shut you down like a vault
With a combination, laceration, brain station, malfunction
You wake up in a C-C day bed, sissy
You can't play Ed
No cartridge, style foul, like a partridge
In a bare tree, hear, see, feel, touch
You don't appeal much
No skill, you better chill, you funny like Bill
Telling me, what you telling me, really
I make fresh rhymes daily
Like Carvel or ?martel and sunset?
Bust some set, you wanna throw signs and can't flow rhymes
Many boast while I rock any coast
LA Times to the New York Post

[Chorus 3x]
Sucka MCs please think twice
I'm to nice kid I'm just to nice

I got so many styles that I've stopped countin'
While many wishin', any fish in, a fountain
Eastern, mountain, central, pacific
Or any other zone in specific, microphonelific
Heard you read about, whats Ed about
Dont doubt, I don't wanna have to spell it out
And if I let it out its gonna be a body
Lyrically, godly, while you hardly
Deserve to serve, what nerve
Human, assumin', you can ruin, what you doin?
Puttin' 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 together
I'd say you just got ate, hot plate comin' through
You ain't great enough to, get with the sick flu
Makin' you turn blue, like a Smurf
I blew Earth and I'm makin' you work
That's why you on my back like a shirt

[Chorus x5]
Sucka MCs please think twice
I'm to nice kid I'm just to nice
