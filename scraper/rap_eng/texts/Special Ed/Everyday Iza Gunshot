[Verse 1: Bounty Killer]
Since way back when
Fucking up shit with the pad and the pen
Ran shit before so I run shit again
40's back
I'm the Bounty hunter
Only escape is six feet under
I be lurking, waiting, debating, anticipating
Take you out on Church or on Dayton
Yeah it's on and Babylon is on my back
Cool and relaxed always gotta stay strapped
Bust caps perhaps
If I catch ya in a beef
Fuck around and bust out the bwoy's front teeth
In fared on the head, yeah good as dead
Go check the dread and get me a phat head
If that the way it gotta be then it gotta be
Not dying at 23
Looking more towards the year 2040
I'll probably still being to court G

[Verse 2: Special Ed]
I had to come out and dumb out cause I'm from out the way
And Church Avenue ain't having you
So go back to your wack block with your crack rock
No don't let me [?] Glock
Cock bang then go to Bangkok
And lay low
I don't play yo
Fuck ceelo, give me some yayo, a kilo
And let me flip it, I'll get more equipment
Yeah, yeah, plus another shipment
I don't play games with dames or with flames
Or with names
Don't call mine or you're all mine
Don't cross the war line
I don't play that
So say that
Forget the drama or I get your mama
On Christmas, dis ya must admire
Ya must embod'
Ya must wan' meet God
Well I'll be glad to introduce you
He could use you
A soul on a roll
And I'm in total control
Of the situation
I rule the nation
Indivisible
I'm invisible you can't see me
Word to Mimi, I'm like a genie
Cause I appear and disappear and reappear
And miss a year
You know why?
I got the antidote for civilization (what's that?)
Eradication

[Hook: Bounty Killer] {x2}
Everyday is a gun shot
Lord have mercy

[Verse 2: Bounty Killer]
Set sail
On the seven seas
Roll like a pirate Shanghi'ing MC's
Walk the plant
Deep into the water
That's an order
No sign of manslaughter
Why?
This kids head I'm about to fly
Always talking about the I.N.I
And I.N.I
I ain't the one since the shit begun
Look down the barrel of my dirty magnum
I walk the streets after dark
Hear the gun bark all ya see is a spark
A big flash so I dash up the block
Followed by a cop brandishing his Glock
Road blocks ahead now I'm caught in-between
No time to think, loading the magazine
I'm going out for broke
No joke
Won't stop till the end of the gun smoke
Won't be framed or blamed
If I get caught then the story will be changed
Only evidence is I've tape recorded
Heads got it on a flight that's now boarded
Told 'em in case of emergency, make a copy
Give one to gangsta and the other Reverend Jessie
He'll know what to do with that
And just remember to always stay black
Holy shit, kinda funny to me
Guess who set me up (who?)
Rudolph Giuliani
Haha...watch the ride
