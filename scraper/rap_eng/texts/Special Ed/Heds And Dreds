You see me? Special Ed
Touch the riddim there, dead

When me chat you know that you have to respond
When I use a yankee I rock to Jamaican
No matter what nationality you come from
Because the lyrics will fill ya like they food when ya nyam
'Cause this is positive vibes, no negativity at all
The bigger they come, well it's the bigger they hall
'Cause me a move them, me a move th-e-e-em
Everybody dined, every pint, every stem
Me a move them eye rapidly, that a REM
Fix your pants, put, wide at the hem
Clear you throat, eh-eh ehm, lotta phlegm
Eh-eh eh, e-eh-eh-eh-eh ehm
One little boy never know say make it
In preef and brief it caught it broke and tryna break it
Me take ya mami grip and rip them strips until they're naked
Cut off your locks Jah, ya know that they're sacred
Me spring ya mami, bring em in the open, son
I'm making mon, Jah know
And moth is born 'til Special Ed said and done
Because I, Action, and Howie Tee
Full of originality
And anybody keep something from me
You will be ba-ba-ballin-a
'Cause we're no joke, ja know somethin' to joke
I'm in a smibbida smoke, they givin' it givin' it givin' it court
'Cause au naturel arouse stimulation
And if you need more, me go pon vacation
Go a Hawaii, Jah know me like to fly in my Concorde
My tongue is like a sword
Me will slash you with words 'til you torn
Make the blood pour on and then when it is poured
Make a stroke on the board, send the score
Whenever me chat, you know it's that it cannot be ignored
It cannot be ignored
Because these are the workings of the Lord
No compitious style, wickin' out, wilin' while I wicked
Sometimes I get stuck, in other words I might get sticked
Once I use the style, jah know that the style is what I pick it
If you tell me that, you think you know you got sticked
If your skin is slightly pissed, then you are only naked
When I touch you with them tongue, you will then be lick it
But if invite ya heart, ya know the bucket you have kicked
I told you the style was wicked
