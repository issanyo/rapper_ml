[Verse 1: Canibus]
Free Morpheus, I'm glorious, notorious
Knowledge is infinite, I live in the fortress
Of friendship poetic penmanship
The phrenology of a mentalist, free exhibition for benefit
Been getting bands off 16's since 19
I was rolling on 20s and 20 with highbeams
Free run, jump the gun, freeze motherfucker, I'm done
You still learning how to use your lungs
Your honest freeman's respect played my mysterious depth
Money, murder, mayhem, a mess
Freedom, free to forget, sure, feel free to confess
You are awarded stress-free recess
Freedom, freak the funk, Hip Hop, free to say what you want
You can fly but you better not flaunt
Gold fronts, come here you, go to the front
You get everything for free cause you ain't got no funds
10, 000 feet forward, flight cabin red light beep
The flight captain say a prayer for your sheep
The sheep which took a team of free liturgy e-readers
We listen to it on loudspeakers in FEMA
But yeah, tan free range chicken soup cans
Ambush, I had a fireman carry ya fans
Freelance, dead bodies laid across the land to feed ants
They said that it was a freak accident

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Free money out of the bank, of course they was free to say thanks
You might as well free-fall off a plank
Like T-Roy, Heavy D B-Boyz
This feels pre-recorded, we are exploited by freakazoid call ya
Pre-approven, free is an illusion, it's frickin' confusin'
Free music, I was free to use it, don't be foolish
Productivity doesn't mean it's free to produce it
You figure we should go forward or remove it
You fans gotta pay Fandango in a van
Pinch your mini-van, nigga must be in France
Free-roamer, free to talk to the POTUS, folk is fomenting emotion
You are free to choose your associates
Foreign technology provide us
Insider information provided by five advisors
Phone number?  Who wants to find it?
Sure, for we ain't vibin', be nice about it, already tried it
Thin flat wetsuit wing, flat white phosphorus impact
That you backdoor with Syntex
For every three firearms you get a free bottle of Windex
Throw in a free TruGlo wind flex
Who wants to flex, wants to pretext
Nigga I rap for free cause you ain't done shit for me yet
I rock for a fee, ain't shit free, black Master G
And Comet Canibus great N-I-C-E, Domingo L.P. 2015, 2015
