[Verse]
Boy, come on get with this 'cause you can't diss this
I'm burnin' your ass like syphillis
A fast brother, you're just a lover with a slow hand
I freeze MCs into Frosty the Snowman
No man withstands the pain of brain cells
Phaser, hellraiser, cut like a laser
Polo plays a part, inside the arts, the rap charts
Start to break you apart, so get smart
You cry for help, knowin' you felt the rhyme
Makin' the track melt, Polo chops like a black belt
MCs are grounded, pounded down, astounded
Rounded up, pounds of sounds when I drowned them
Surrounded, check the date, and play when rate too great
Related too late, I demonstrate fate
I'm fast and passin' the stage of an assassin
Massacre, in a mass I start blastin'
Thereotical, periodicial
Blowin' up particles of molecules, here, read the articles
Every time I built a plan, it killed a man
MCs got smoked without a filter and
Scuffed and puffed like marijuana
Terminator of data and your rhymes is Sarah Conner
You can't rip out, rap up, slip up, slap up
'Cause you're trapped up to get capped up
Play the back of this here scenery
You clowns'll get broke down like machinery
I bring trouble on the double, bust you like a bubble
Hard rocks are crushed into rubble
The gates of Hell open wide to scope in
And I'm hopin', you're brought to the pope and
The Holy Bible when you made your arrival
Now, the name of the game is survival
The result isn't real difficult, the strategy:
Stayin' Alive like John Travolta
My rhymes are gettin' hotter
I got around to a lot of towns like a Globetrotter
So, I'mma give you the Hell that you brought me in
I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion
I just follow your footprint, trace, track and blackout
You better shout to get a rap out
What I arrange, invented, is strange, demented, deranged
You changed when I entered
A stage of furious rage when I had this madness
Badness, you felt sadness
Raps are brave and outrageous
All those chicken rhymes you written
Should be put in the Yellow Pages
I stand tall, play the wall, and watch your brain stall
And wet your ass like rainfall
I think you need a replacement, you're illin'
Call that buildin', boy? You're still in the basement
A brain cell swells to jam like a pelican
Fresh out of breath, death left you a skeleton
I'm gonna need your full cooperation
This is a matter of life and death, operation:
To ease a man in the siege of surgery
Of being dumb without anesthesia
Go slow? Hell no, I let the beat kick
And I get wicked like the Witches of Eastwick
I'm not soft, I kill suckers off
Disarmin' it, bombin' it, off in a coffin
You get struck and just like a motherfuckin' duck
And plucked this shit out of luck and bucked
Designated to self-destruct
Knocked around like a hockey puck
K-double-O-L G R-A-P, N-O M-C plays me
You wish your name had a G
But to be a badder G, boy, you gotta play with strategy
Top rankin', thinkin' ability, memory bankin'
But instead, you're just sinkin'
I attack like a pack of whacked out maniacs
G Rap's back
