[Intro: Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Look young mister, what's your name"
"The mastermind name is..."
"38"
"38"
"That master that's right"
"Where you from"
"New York"
"Don't be running 'round here bucking up like you the shit, little nigga"

"38"
"38"
"I thought that was special"
"Man you better raise off my face whoever the fuck you are nigga you 'bout to catch 'em"
"38"

[Chorus: 38 Spesh]
Now if you want to go to war, nigga we can meet
Gangstas move in silence and we don't speak
Certain way that you played when you in the streets
We can make problems or we can make peace
If you want to make money, homie we can meet
Know it ain't a problem, I got her and it's cheap
You worried about dollars, I'm worried about beef
We can make problems or we can make peace

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
On every block, I'm the gossip of Pablo product
Your work dissolve in water, my shit blow the pot up
Get up, sharp as a razor blade, he out to get major paid
Rocks on his chest, clock his neck like he Flava Flav
But play, I make your brain hang like an Asian braid
Lamping in mansions, getting laid from an Asian maid
The K will leave you head smoking like you're blazing haze
G be the harsh fellow, y'all niggas is marshmallows
Fuck around, get roast on them sticks 'til you're hard and yellow
My hoes addicted to me, level belts, mark the elbows
Brunettes blonds tracks on they arms I could start a railroad
Killers move in silence, so I'm moving in stealth mode
To shell your whole fucking body like a snell glove
Your chain, talk nigga, get stuck like a Velcro
Bullet shells in a row, where I'm from, it's a hellhole
I weigh it out like the scale with the pel blow

[Chorus: 38 Spesh]
Now if you want to go to war, nigga we can meet
Gangstas move in silence and we don't speak
Certain way that you played when you in the streets
We can make problems or we can make peace
If you want to make money, homie we can meet
Know it ain't a problem, I got her and it's cheap
You worried about dollars, I'm worried about beef
We can make problems or we can make peace

[Verse 2: 38 Spesh]
I've been a threat since Mama gave birth
Days that I ain't sleep, so I've became worse
I put a nigga inside the grave first
His wedding and his wake was inside the same church
He got married and buried by the same pastor
Funeral, the cemetery the day after
Since a youth, I was taught how to aim backwards
Therefore, I'm not the nigga to chase after
They wonder where I got the chips from
I told them, I don't sleep 'til the bricks done
The outcome could be 100 years and some
But fuck the outcome, I'm worried about the income
Plenty nights I done starved to get it right
It's kinda hard, you can't dodge the city life
Now my ice shine hard on city lights
If they pull over the car, they'll probably give me life

[Chorus: 38 Spesh]
Now if you want to go to war, nigga we can meet
Gangstas move in silence and we don't speak
Certain way that you played when you in the streets
We can make problems or we can make peace
If you want to make money, homie we can meet
Know it ain't a problem, I got her and it's cheap
You worried about dollars, I'm worried about beef
We can make problems or we can make peace

[Outro: Scratches by DJ Premier]
