[Intro]
[?]NY Home of the thoroughbreds, Ya Know
HumpDay productions, let's go

[Verse 1]
They got the whole world counting on this come back
City to city like where the fuck your son at?
Wasting too much time fucking with them dumb rats
Whoever slept on the boy, shouldn't have done that
Now go stand in the corner, here put on your dunce hat
He real with it
He cocks both of his guns back
He about to make a call to Cali for his Spanish Muscle
Then I'mma spin one of you niggas like the Spanish hustle
You ain't here
Be from Queens, cos the can is muffle
He moved a shaker so hard
He turned the land to rubble
Dumb dopes you just opened up a can of trouble
I bet my life on it mack
That this is the gambler's double
It's not a good look, don't make them have to paint a picture
Give rose beds put your head with a train of clickers
I see you niggas not seeing like a gang of Hitlers
When arousing a black cloud it's gonna bring a twister

[Hook]
Surgical scrubs, check
Surgical gloves, check
I murder you mugs
Now clear I’m about to go in
Mask for the mug, check
Sponge for the blood, check
Now give ‘em the drugs
And clear I’m about to go in
Scissors and knife, check
Now give me some lights, check
Get six of them wipes
And clear I’m about to go in
Pins and the lube, check
A few of them tubes, check
Some medical glue
Now clear I’m about to go in

[Verse 2]
There's only room in this town for one dude in black
And I'll pack lead in your back like school is back
I'll leave you niggas with waves like it's a hula snack
You look a little tired homie, you could use a nap
You ain't got to tell me twice where the food is at
He keeps shots in his arms like a user's tracts
Dum-Dums all in his guns like it's a foolish strap
No child line skipping here
True pursuit are back
Mine is enterprise crime, you's a petty crook
You throw that hoodie on it's about to be a heavy juxe
I'm about to leave a smoke cloud like some deadly kush
Well, well, well lookie what we have here
Shell, shell, shell, nobody now the path clear
Nothing but cash here
Y'all just looking half queer
Sixteen ruler headlights like I'm about to smash deers
And put 'em in the grass dere
Be on their last steers
I leave your head missing a side like it's a bad pair
I'm taking your spot
I'm about to put my flag here

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Save your wack verses
OK [?] I don't feel your raps
And you don't know me boy, don't try to get familiar cat
Orangutangs trying to tangle with the silverbacks
[A couple of things from out the bing will leave 'em real relaxed?]
You had your run time the fun's over, chill with that
You Fred Flintstone nigga
Where your Wilma at?
I'm onto my dividends, was born for the Entenmann’s
Ya toddlers in the play pen
G will put an end to them
There's hope man
The dope man is coming with the thick/fix syringe
I see your pay day is Friday
Some drinks again [?]
You made a little name but now your flame is flickering
Only they counting as if this cheddar never makes it friend
He on his grind game he heading for the strips again
Clown don't make me have to come around this bitch again

[Hook]
