[Kool G. Rap]
Yo, I come in the form of danger lurkin'
Blastin' a mag, strange and murkin'
Shot at strangers from out the Ranges and Suburbans
Curtains for anybody perpin'
Leavin' 'em hurt for certain
Blood on the curb, with bandages like turbans
We roll the durban
All in this dirt, puffin' the herb and
We bring the verbs in
Double action's loaded with Germans
Area's urban, block's hot where we be swervin'
Gun fights strike like a serpent
Leave your nerves jerkin'
Lay down any person
Strictly for just target rehearsin'
The skills remain tight as Holy Mary the Virgin
Slowly carry the burden
So we varied the shit you heard an'
Hit you with the different methods and versions;
We simply
Let bullets rip until the clip is empty
Get laid in your tracks as if you was SMPTE
Hit you like Jack Dempsey
The MAC-packin' emcee, with gats clappin' like an M.P
Open your friendly wimpy, frame like a M.D
Blow you until your block's windy
Be on sort of a shot frenzy
My Glocks don't stop 'til the cops hem me
Blow only hollow tops in me
Hazardous shit - guns is accurate
Sendin' niggas to meet the King of Nazareth
Playin' me close has a risk
I bash cliques like they was masochist
Blast the tear gas, thinkin' I'm pacifist
Pass the fifth
One last kiss before your ass is missed
These bastards is gettin' clapped by the strapped activist

Chorus: Kool G. Rap (repeat 2X)

Yo, let the games begin
The Tec and MAC-10 flames begin
Thugs to the end, my whole crew insane with sins
Hammers to firing pins
Me and my kin be makin you spin
The Lord or The Devil be takin' you in

[Kool G. Rap]
It's the Corona Queens apocalypse
My block is hit with the dark eclipse
Taking the hostages
So grab the Glocks and clips
The rap's apostle-ist, Big as the Loch Ness
Large as Colossus is
Marvelous shit
Get shot at the esophagus
The Thug Saga novelist
Sexin' this rap shit; monogamous
Rainin' like the tropics, while you be topic-less
Blood money monopolist - do it for eons
Shinin' like it's, neon - heart colder than freon
Decidin' which emcee to pee on;
Baby cause that's the shit that we on
Niggas go to Warrick like Dionne
Put the G on
I analyze guys with Montana eyes
To vandalize any man alive, soon as the hammer rise
Cut em down like samurais
Kickin' that real shit that you fantasize
Niggas step aside and recognize
G; the real cat, pack a steel gat, baby feel that
Leave you layin flat witcha shit clapped and peeled back
Battle-actin' rap; shit'll put you in back of a Cadillac
A bad decision; fuck up your whole vision like cataracts
Red roses on a dead foe
Layin' in wet clothes from head blows
Your whole brain be exposed
Get your body torn out the frame from lead throws
None of my victims ever bled slow
Stiff as Edgar Poe, that's how it go

Chorus: Kool G. Rap (repeat 2X)

Yo, let the games begin
The Tec and MAC-10 flames begin
Thugs to the end, my whole crew insane with sins
Hammers to firing pins
Me and my kin be makin you spin
The Lord or The Devil be takin' you in
