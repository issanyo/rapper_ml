[Intro: Marley Marl + (samples)]
(“Kool G. Rap and…”)
Yo baby, give me that bicycle horn
(“…Polo”)
(“DJ Polo, the man I’m behind…”)
(“Turntables”)
Yo G. Rap…

[Verse 1: Kool G. Rap]
Rough cuts bandit, can’t understand it
You gotta hand it to him, he planned it
As if the camera’s candid
A DJ we say is okay
Back from the old days, past the O’Jays
Dishin’ out danger, the beat re-arranger
To bite is like taking a ride with a stranger
Girls who wanna spread it, he’ll shred it like wheat
And to make this beat complete, his name is…

Yo, Polo, let me hear you get funky now

[DJ Polo scratching]

Yo, Polo, cut up “Is he nice or what”

(“Is he nice or what?”)

That’s it, baby
That’s it, that’s it, that’s it right there
He’s nice, check him out
What’s his name again?

Yo, Polo, that girl don’t believe you’re dope, show this girl how it’s done

(“Polo, show ‘em how it’s done”)

Yeah, I told you head could do it
How you feel now? Ha ha ha
I think you feel like a penny on the moon
Yo yo, let’s have a little bit of fun with it, come on, Polo, go off

(“Let’s have some fun”)

Yeah, yo, let’s have a little bit more fun, come on
Yo, let’s break it down just a little bit more, come on
Yo, that’s kinda funky, now that is funky
Yo, Polo, let’s get to the bridge, take me to the bridge, come on

I’m sure that the people out there wanna hear from you ‘cause this is your record
Go on with it

[Outro: DJ Polo]
Yo, word up
Yo, I wanna take a little time out to say hello to my partner in crime Kool G. Rap
I wanna say hello to my man Clash
I wanna say thanks to my producer, Marley Marl, word
I wanna say thank you to JC for bringing me and G. Rap back and forth to the studio to

Finish this album
Yo, I wanna say hello to our dancers Shawn and Kenny
I wanna say hello to my homeboy Baby J in Roseland and the Roseland Posse
I wanna say hello to my man Junebug
I wanna say hello, definitely, to the Juice Crew
Yo, I wanna say hello…yo, yo, yo…

[Studio owner]
Man, get on out the studio, your time is up
They payin’ for enough time
You get on out the studio, your time is up, baby
You get on outta here
I don’t care if this is your record
I own the place
Get out! Get out!
And give me back my damn bicycle horn…
