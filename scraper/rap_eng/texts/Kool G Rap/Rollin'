[Intro: Kxng Crooked]
I can’t just put him up there just because the media says whatever the hell they want to say. You know what I mean? He only had two albums that I heard and they were dope. But I can’t say that he was better than Kool G Rap

[Chorus: DJ Revolution and Mike Smith]
Everywhere we go
Everywhere that we go, you know how we roll
Look what I did ya’ll
You know how we roll
Rollin, rollin
Gots to roll deep
Everywhere that we go, you know how we roll
You know how we roll
Rollin, we roll deep
Everywhere that we go, you know how we roll
Rollin, that’s how we move
No doubts to dishonor
We roll through the city
Heat the block up
Everywhere that we go

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Catch him chilling in a villa or bungalow
Drilling in a humble hoe
Jungle fever, she a diva, wouldn’t turn her though
Some mad Schappell and Paris Hiltons
Whole neck covered in diamonds
Hunned carats spilling
I left your key to the lavish building
White marble walls
Ten slices, I’m enlarging them all
Paintings full off the deck with some blonde pieces
Bikini lines from the suntan but wrong reasons
We sipping on some margaritas
Throw in the pineapples
Pee on they wall so much I got a front speckle
Holding they system I’mma twist them till they spine ravel
And I don’t need handcuffs I got their mind shackled

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
Yeah this time I blew they minds
Jumped out the norm
Out the ratio lines
Suburba house picket fence and ivy vines
You say I need IV lines
Foreign ifusion, I feel I’m an intrusion
Daddy what they looking for
They ain’t seen nothing like me before
Oh he might slow Spike Lee
Rapper, played ball likely
She held me tightly
They stared at the air like a knife
What about my wife, what about my life
I thought it was complete
Damn I miss the concrete
Chinese food and the Oxford
What they throwing rocks for
They had a party next door
Something came up missing
Police said listen, you new on the block
And this is how we rock, we keep our shines in order
You and your wife and daughter might feel better
In the patches by the town border
Wow, it’s crazy, crazy

[Chorus: DJ Revolution and Mike Smith]
Rollin
Everywhere that we go, rollin
You know how we roll
Rollin
Gots to roll deep
Everywhere that we go, you know how we roll
Rollin
Everywhere that we go, rollin
You know how we roll
Rollin
Gots to roll deep
Everywhere that we go, you know how we roll
Rollin
That’s how we moving
No doubt, roll through the city
We heat the block up
No doubt, shit is on
We roll through the city
Everywhere that we go, you know how we roll
You know how we roll
