(Talking) whasup girl?, I know that ya man and all but yo, what you see
In that nigga? you need to get with a nigga like me, for real, does he
Got one of these GS-4's? Navigator system and everything, word up....

Chorus - (Singing) Thats all I wanted, was someone special, someone
Sacred in my life, Baby won't you be my Daddy Figure......

Verse 1
I regulated you from fake dudes to lake views
Minks with laced jewels
Nails, hairdo's and facials
Placed you in snake shoes
Did it up right, took the six night seven day cruise
The beige creludes
Your pockets stay full, upgraded you, the whole way through
I made you my suede boo, main chick, wifey and Angel
Put ten Karrots on your wrist, five on your ankle
My whole angle, allow you in my triangle
To shine and twinkle, eat steak off a platinum single
'Em other cats is rectangles, they sweat bad girls
They Bullwinkles, tricks of Rip Van Winkles
But now you mingle with a real cat that gets the Pringles
And all you gotta be is thankful that we can see the sea food menu's
Push whips, hit all the venues
Fly gear sharp as Ginsu's
Stare at the other pairs of gym shoes
As long as you continue, to keep it genu
Never pretend to, I know its in you
The true Mommi, jigged out female Armani
With tight Nani, holdin' on Cristal and Donny
Roll with mad Parmesani
Pretty the most, no lactose, had to play you close
Fataly attracted like Glen Close
Made other men ghost
Staright overdose of high post
You rollin' with me, rich mans wife live your life in luxury
Deluxe VP's
Hologram covered T.V''s
300 E with the CD
Sip Martini's in Tahiti
Jamaican Rum inside the Kiwi
Play the major leagues, them other cats is pee-wee
They see me and you boo, plush cribs in Malibu
I'll profile with you, push my whip a mile or two
You can have it all cause I like the style in you
All you gotta do is be real and stay true
Chill in the Jacuzzi with the G tatoo by ya lap boo
We can run around and act fool
Your Daddy Figure, the one that got love for you kid....

Chorus 2X

Verse 2:
Yo, we could sip ale on rocks
Sail on yachts
Rock the Rolex watch with hail on top
Boot knock, eat Lobster tail on docks
Cristal inside the ice pail dont stop
Drop top, SEL, cell on lock
Gift shop, come out of Bloomingdales on cots
You think not? you could see though
Go from Moschino to Tuxedo's
As long as you only fuck me though
House with the twin gazebo's
Ceelo's, with the Champaigne orders by the waters of Puerto Rico
Peep the live show featuring Tito
Rockin' your fly Donna's
Private jet to the Bahamas
You still knockin' all the Mommas
Premadonna on the set
Mad fly jewels around the neck
Cut perfect
The linen skirt set
Didn't even flip the long Sable fur yet
The iced out burgette with the matchin' purse set
Five thousand when the Chanel was purchased
Strictly for the purpose
I stress you to roll with mine
Lookin' live
Close from a day old drive, push a five
Jet ski drive, skooba-dive
Live not survive, tryin' to keep it alive
See the sun rise, clear blue skies
Too fly
The sunshine got the ice blindin' your eye
High priced merchandise shipped over shores
Seven Karrots out of Paris on the Concord
With a fine broad
Bottle of wine poured
Bungalos
Bundles of ones with O's
Broadway shows, fly condos
Sweet as Pendinico, Tiger skins Albino
Live with Tony Bennet on piano, white lacker combo
Me and you cat, yo, we can see that, you in the new Spider
Me inside the navy blue Viper
With the pipers, covered in some silk fibers
Millionaire type of life, your future wife(?)
Got you under the wing
Maybe run you my name
Everything one and the same
Your Daddy Figure who adore you
Spend for you
Bend for you
Hurt up other men for you
Down to bust around for you
Stick somebody in the ground for you
Kid, I'll hold it down for you
I'll catch a round for you
I'll lounge for you
You know the deal, I love you to death just keep it real yo.....

Chorus 2X
