[Verse 1: Necro]
Unload the burner from a tower, holding the source power
30 for ransom, I’ll murder one every hour
Raps a disaster full of retards in leotards tryna be hard
Only way you kill shit is me dying from laughter
I'm a leader like Luther King
But the truth is I'll pull out the heater doofus and get ruthless for your bling
Crack your limbs with the black Timb's, stomp a bitch in
When it comes to Necro and G Rap, there ain't no competition
Your best verse is worse then my worse verse
Prepare for death, rehearse in a hearse, evil like a verse reverse
I was nice when you was just sperm don't doubt it
G Rap was already bout it when i just turned 12 and learned how to spit, SALUTE!!
Got no love for police undercover beast
Danny Glover homo Mario Cuomo Governor leech
You never went brraapp, your more like Borat, a whore twat
You might have family members that are gangster, but your not

[Hook: Necro (Kool G Rap)]
Give you a heart attack, we hard rocks like God smack
You fronted like you hard kid and you got smacked
(Godfathers with the gats) Even God will get clapped
Aim at the heavens and blast, ridiculous
(We serious as a heart attack)
We hard rocks like Godsmack
You fronted like you hard kid and you (got smacked)
Godfathers melt the track, even the devil got bucked up
(Fucked up) What? What? (Slice, slice) Cut, cut

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
We from third world living conditions, pitchin and gun clickin
Play hide and seeks in the streets, where they slump kids in
Some tongues spittin the truth y'all niggas front
Spittin barrel to your fuckin ear drum, hear the slums written
War tour in Queens the shit like Fallujah kid
Ruger Six, Smith & Wesson lessons will loose your wig
KGR and Necro we coming through this bitch
Come fly through the strip like you the shit
Get lost like a plane out of tower range that flew through Bermuda mist
Walk around in the ghetto metal heavy as sewer lids
Beautiful view to where dope shooters and users live
That's where they double cross the cross wire cross hair
Shit to have em send the red cross here
Heavy-matics, heavy traffic kick a hit tryna cross here
Cross these streets with crosses like they freezer froze
Get crossed up nigga better be Croccifixio
