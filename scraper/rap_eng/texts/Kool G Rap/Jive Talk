[Verse 1]
A letter to you suckers
Each and every one of you duck muthafuckas
Your girl puckers her lips, so I stuck her
You're jellin' me, well, so what the hell you're tellin' me?
Now, I'mma show you fuckin' with me is a felony
I'm crushin', so you suckers can start hushin'
Shush, no discussion, cuz I'mma start rushin'
The payback, and I attack a pack that's wack
The black mack; brown like a Cracker Jack
Slick and quick, I go pick a vic to stick and kick some shit
Chicks I dick whip; the one
Kill her for fun with a gun, my son
I don't run, I get muthafuckas done
It don't matter, I make niggas scatter
Teeth starts to chatter, your head I'mma splatter
Arraigned, breakin' a main vein
And watchin' my name bring you pain
I'm standin' on your blood stain
Hard to hold, I'm bold, I roll real cold
Too much soul, dick made of gold
I rolled niggas to hell; you tried to swell, but fell
Now get well or die like a dry cell
A rap villain, chillin' and I don't give a fuck about a killin'
Cuz I'm still in effect when you're illin'
A terrorist; I terrorize like an assassin
Yes, I'm trespassin', your ass I'm harassin', huh
Talk is cheap, I'm keepin' ya six feet deep, so don't sleep
When I creep, you'll leap like athletes slammin'
Examine what I'm jammin'
Hey, I don't play -- I burn like a gamma ray
Lay for prey; display the bait and wait...
Muthafuckas are scared straight!

[Verse 2]
Yo, check this out...
The creature, feature, searcher, preacher, teacher
Torture, rupture, capture rapture, reach ya
Musical master, mind reacts as a
Brain that has the knowledge of NASA
You're just a Kit-Kat, small as a Tic-Tac
But I'm a Big Mac, cuz I'm G Rap
Well equipped with a hip-hop lip
My memory bank is like a microchip
My bass will give a shake of an earthquake
It'll make you, sucker MC, wanna jump in the lake
Cuz I'm murder, homi-cide, comma
Crush, kill, destroy with excitement and drama
Speaker, sound seeker, you become weaker
My art is a smoker, your material is mediocre
The Rap Olympia; devastate the area
Again, I'm brainier, lyrical mania
Power source, and a G enforced
Your headboards, they need rap wars
So, come one or two, step through for a few
Doubles and couples -- and I'll cripple all triples
Boy, you can't handle it
None or any, one or many, some or plenty
Cuz I'm not the stranger, just the rhyme arranger
Highly explosive, keep out, danger!
Packin' Gs while you try to beat me
But for these MCs, I call 'em all wannabe G's
What I write is in a smokin' section
Here's an injection of rap perfection
So, what the heck? You select my dialect
Next man's cassette, yo, reject and eject
Cuz I could use a technique, modern or antique
Beats never repeat, show you that I can speak
Totally, properly, but rappers wanna copy me
This takes strategy, just like Monopoly
Figure it out:
Kool G Rap is about makin' armies and crews look like Girl Scouts
Cuz when I start rappin', I keep the people clappin'
Suckers that be yappin' don't think that this can't happen...

(Yo, MCs, all wannabe Kanes and Chuck Ds, Es, Fs, Gs
ROCK H-I-Js, Ks, L-M-N-O-Ps
It's a fact some of these, are wack similes, but freeze...
Catch the wave, later; that was not the alphabet
But I'm an Alpha Beta, Kappa...rappers, who join my alumni
Step to this if you're prejudiced... PEACE!)
