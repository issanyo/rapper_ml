[Chorus]
Yeah, criminal outfit, we kill it
Like, fuck the sky, we rising past the limit
Full clips, ain't no bullshit permitted
Yeah, criminal outfit, we kill it
Criminal outfit, we hit it
The mob way, nigga, dark shades and fitteds
Race cars from the parkways, we did it
Yeah, criminal outfit, we kill it

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Chrome'll get waves, homes
Your dome'll get blazed
Get blown with the gauge
Your bones in the grave
Rich from drug money
The rest from hookers
DT's stressin' the bookers
Niggas wanna a jokes just turn on the pressure cookers
That nigga's duckin' and dodgin'
Up in the priest, so fuck it, we're sergeants
Guns cut bonkers, fuck it, your conscience
Fuck O M Nasis, 5 Family Click
You live handle these clips
Guns up, get the ones up
No late shots, hit my targets from the lungs up
Triggers click on robbery shit
Split the funds up
Nigga, four pound hoodie, down raisin' the gums up
We 'bout raisin' the slums up
Yeah, raisin' the dump up

[Verse 2: NORE]
Yeah, I know gangsta
Killer rich niggas that move to Dubai
So rich, that them niggas try to buy 'em the sky
That mean, Qatar oil money
Abu Dubai crisis
Fuck baby mama drama
They got ex-wife crisis
Ex-marines that they hire as sharpshooter
Ebola in your Coca-Cola, while your car cooper
Yeah, you see I show your chick sharing
I threw her in the Uber, she couldn't fit the McLaren
Back in the days of the boulevard of Linden
I used to sell crack and always carried the Linen
You the borrowing type, I'm the type that's lending
The object of the game is to make more than you're spendin'
You from a different era, you niggas in there pretending
You pay half, but you'll be dead if you don't pay the rest
Ain't into teachin', man, I leave that shit to KRS
Cocaine democracy, my philosophy
Kill your hypocrisy
For Boardwalk monopoly
You see it's four war place talk
We had to FaceTalk
Made him sniff a whole kilo
It blew his face off

[Chorus]
Yeah, criminal outfit, we hit it
Like, fuck the sky, we risin' past the limit
Full clips, ain't no bullshit permitted
Yeah, criminal outfit, we hit it
Criminal outfit, we hit it

Criminal outfit, we hit it
The mob way, nigga, dark shades and fitteds
Race cars from the parkways, we did it
Yeah, criminal outfit, we hit it
