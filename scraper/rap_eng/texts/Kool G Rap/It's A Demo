People in the audience—Kool G Rap is my name
I write rhymes and insert them inside your brain
And DJ Polo—the man I'm behind—
He operates the turntables when I'm rocking my rhymes, see—

[It's a demo] (x4)

Psychopath on the phonograph, nut of the cuts
You heard the boy slice, is he nice or what?
He's the main entertainer inside the show
And he goes by the name of DJ Polo, see...

[It's a demo] (x4)

I supply the data, he's the wheel operator
We're walking tall and we're called The Terminators
I'm Kool G Rap, and he's Polo
He cuts like a pro when I go solo
He's a record spinner winner, that you can bet
Eats DJ's for dinner on his table set
With cuts he concocts and the party rocks
DJ's want to Xerox it out the box
A professional performer, wheels of steel trainer
One hundred percent excellent entertainer
The maker and creator of the lyrical line
Idea of Shakespeare, the mind of Einstein
Surrender, pretender, you don't exist
As a vocalist, so you can kiss this
I'm Kool G Rap, greatest of all times
And you can see it, inside my rhymes
See it's a demo

[It's a demo] (x4)

My recital will form a musical brainstorm
Powerful sound waves where ear drums are torn
The performer recites, competitors ignite
Audiences tonight I came to incite
Fascinating results, a defeat will be difficult
Equivalent to a thousand volts
To my brief rap speech you attach like a leech
Examine when I'm jamming and when I preach
Before I'm completed, you will all be deleted
You said I sucked, instead I succeeded
Fan fascinator, I supply data
According to the groove, I'm a real smooth operator
I activate a musical device
Dialogues are concise, no need to splice
My system contains musical rap rain
Instrumentals inserted inside your brain
All levels rate low with a medium tempo
I give a dramatical cameo show
And now you know DJ Polo
These party people are ready to go
See it's a demo

[It's a demo] (x4)

Better than a Snicker when it comes to a snack
I go solo with Polo when I'm in combat
I'm the MC humanoid and I just get annoyed
Boy you'll be destroyed cause you copy like a Polaroid
Coming like a meteor inside any area
Make the people merrier, vicious like a terrier
Like a terrorist, I will terrorize
Telling any territory I'm a glory enterprise
The microphone fanatic, cause I'm the Asiatic
Brotherman from the motherland, rappers automatically
Suffer as I suffocate, then I start to alienate
Make you an inmate, so you cannot retaliate
Mutilate at a rate to penetrate you
No other crew can rescue
My talents are balanced my audience is silent
MC's stop biting or I'll get violent
It's a demo...

[It's a demo] (x4)

I take a scene to the extreme
To the climax and those who sleep will have a wet dream
So don't even quote what you write is dolt
Your rhymes are small-time through a microscope
More cooler than an Ice Ages
Biters, let the effective students walk through my white pages
Different stages of rage that I'm going through
And like an owl, you'll know who to
Feed your greed, you want and need
The rhymes that you carefully read, but your eyes bleed
Cause my fury is scary
And if you bite, you'll be leaving all your teeth for the Tooth Fairy
Go ahead and dare me, if you think I'm joking or playing
When you're feeling what I'm saying, you'll be kneeling and praying
Then I release steam like a radiator
And attack MC's like a gladiator
As my talent proceeds to grow, yo
This ain't the end of the show, it's a demo
