[Voices]

You be careful crossin the street
Hey mister, you forgot your things, hey mister

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
I got a job with the mob, makin g’s
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunkie money
I’m drivin' around with ten kilos inside my trunk g
And I’m holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars on my lap in front of my face
And I’m tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to go dip and make a run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? they’ll find me floatin in the hudson river
But if I escape, I’ll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I’m supposed to make a stop
To an uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
So at the next stop sign I pull out and load up the nine
I got the money and the hit
Went through the brook nonstop cause I ain’t droppin off a block of it
Then I thought of a plan
So I drove to my house and got my girl and my little man
C’mon baby, pack your stuff, get ready
Damn, why your face all sweaty?
Just hurry up, don't throw no fits
I’m a dead man walking, understand, we gotta split
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin gucci bags like I was goin on a world tour
Grabbed the luggage and the gun
C’mon we gotta go, you gotta brother on the run

[Hook: Mobsters talking]
Mobster: They gotta the shipment
Don: What?
Mobster: They got the whole shipment
Don: I want that son of a bitch dead, I don't care....

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
Now I’m drivin and I’m lookin at my passport
I’m outta here soon as I hit Kennedy Airport
Loaded the other automatic
I don’t believe this, I'm like a sitting duck stuck in traffic
I’m gettin nervous as hell g
A lincoln continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my girl and then I bent low
Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the guinea's back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin crazy mafia members in the neck
Looked at my girl, a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain’t givin up nothin my brother
Hit me rollin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by little inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my girl is harmed?
Man they only hit her in the upper arm
Now I’m drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is in the back catching heartburns
I got the car shakin' wildly
I made a turn, and then I then I ditched the bimmer in a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin stuff is done
Yeah they got a brother on the run

[Hook: Mobsters Talking]
Don: I want Him dead!
I want his family dead!
I want his house burnt to the ground!

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin with the engine running all night
I started pullin on my ho
What man what? wake up stupid, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I’m headin south no doubt
Don’t care about my whereabouts, as long it’s a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That’s when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin' me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my girl she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
Pulled it- bullets started flyin
Now I’m hittin all them bastards
I’m droppin em fast, while I blast the blood splashes
Then I finally done it
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I’m lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
Catchin' breath the only one left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up on the sucker
Put my gun to his head, whassup now motherfucker?
He said, wait, I want to talk
(three gunshots) I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil’s gun
Now they no longer got a brother on the run
