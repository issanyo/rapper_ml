Check it out
Uh
Now let me tell you a story about a nigga livin' on the edge
Kinda like takin' the chances of jumpin' off the ledge
A money maker
Would often get involved wit the shit thats evolvin' the streets
Lookin' out for the laws
Go hang was the main thang
Was definitely a reason ta get the alias flippin' and check the whole name
Type a nigga that kill you dead for a nigga rock
Get you thinkin' about the prophecy that money got
Hot
But nigga wit the Benz and the ends
Not too many friends
No guts for the glory and the sins
Twins that he got involved wit ta make his ends
Biz that would have him scared in, but took a chance
Didn't care about his daddy
Didn't care about his brotha
Didn't care about his mama
But he cared about them dollas
A bloody world, up in the mind of a soldier
Ta neva die, and keep it live in your holster

[Chorus]
Pay niggas like ta ball
But pay niggas gots ta fall
You know it ain't no heaven for us all
Vouge niggas like ta kill
Vouge niggas like ta feel
Pumpin' up they muthafuckin' steel
Scar niggas gots ta know
Scar niggas make the dough
They used ta gettin' paid from every blow
But all niggas gots ta die
All niggas must decide
It's what around the world they 'gon reside

[Kool G Rap]
Uh, uh
Yo
Spoke nigga turn thug
Ropin' drugs, totin' the snub
Fifty keys of dope in the tub
Enemies soakin' in blood
Catch a open mug
Bodies layin' smoked in the mud
It ain't no hope for love, get poked wit slugs
Peep the nigga M.O
Deliveries in stretch limos
Pickups inside the big truck
Swift bucks get his dick sucked
]From the big buck chick that kept the fifth tuck
She hit ducks, miss puckered up before the clip spark
Swiss duck caught the duplex, navy blue lefts
The lady blew tecs, talkin' 'bout who next
Daily ain't do sex, the crew flex, cruisin' through cess
20 inch chrome spin the gleam
The winnin' team, spend the cream
Livin' American dreams
Brick on the triple beam
Put laser beam dots on your wig top
6 shots hit 'til you drop
Stop the tick-tock
6 and Glocks continue ta pop
Til it's pigs for block
They got this kid rocked
Wit the shit cocked
Shot off the Crip block
Stoppin' more drug traffic than gridlock
Miss not
But forced to us all
10 more came into the door
Wit him in the raw
No time ta waste, the safe's in the floor
Take the keys, takes a freeze
Break wit the G'd caper for cheese
Grab the G
Rape her then leave wit the jackpot
Put her ta sleep wit bad shots
Next day news showin' they snapshots

[Bookie]
Pay niggas
Automatically known wit the ballin'
Wit dope for all em, smellin' the beans when they callin'
Vouge niggas
Gangstas off the wall when they standin' tall
Killin' ain't feelins, wit extra bullets 'nuf ta make em fall
Scar niggas
Who extended it all, makin' deadly calls
Niggas wit coconut balls, breakin' down the laws
But all niggas
Niggas 'gon have ta die wit they eyes lookin to the sky
Or lookin' to the dirt, whichever way it works
And they was comin' for him, but he was blind
A mind of a muthafucka clockin' every dime
This nigga rolled up, a killa
Quickly hit him wit the gauge
Bigga than the graves
Took em days, ta fix him up
A closed casket
This nigga had a kid, now this nigga dead, left behind a bastard
So 19-99 is just anotha year for niggas dyin' the same way
So live your life ta see anotha day

[Chorus]
Pay niggas like ta ball
But pay niggas gots ta fall
You know it ain't no heaven for us all
Vogue niggas like ta kill
Vogue niggas like ta feel
Pumpin' up they muthafuckin' steel
Scar niggas gots ta know
Scar niggas make the dough
They used ta gettin' paid from every blow
But all niggas gots ta die
All niggas must decide
It's what around the world they 'gon reside
