[Intro]
The umm, security we have here today
Not the OPEN security
The ones, that that really sitting there
And really think, we don't know who they are!

"Now that's funky" (4x)

[Verse 1]
Crime don't pay, that's what they tell us
But that's because the other motherfuckers getting jealous
But I'm a tell you this, they neighborhood got the Goodfellas
But they come arrest us for the same shit they sell us
Cause they don't want to see a young black nigga rollin'
Inside a nice car, nice kit, without the shit being stolen
So they come and lock a nigga up
Meanwhile some corrupt, politician nigga is making bigger bucks
Niggas getting blamed for the crystals
But we don't grow the motherfucking coke or weed or make the fucking pistols
Niggas ain't trying to live in poverty
And a black man's lottery's a motherfucking robbery
So yo you gotta make your best
Make a small investment and then put it to the test
Yes, cause the other motherfuckers getting over
Police don't look at a white man strange driving a Range Rover
Carrying shit like it's minerals
The big dollar white dollar suit and tie criminals
Even the government figures
Selling shit to the motherfucking Columbians and rich niggas
Crime isn't time from the brothers
Hey you say it don't pay, it's paying white motherfuckers
It all depends on how you do your shit
Cause you can learn it quick intelligent and that's it! You're well fit!
Fuck workin for a bastard
I got to see that money before my ass sees a casket
Get paid, motherfuck a raise
Cause to all them improper crooked coppers, crime pays

[Hook]
"Jack you motherfuckers" (2x)
"Wake up and go for what you know.."
"Everyone's got to make a living"
"Boy I'm trying to make me some.. MONEY!!"

[Verse 2]
Stop, nigga stop, nigga freeze
But at the same time some old rich fuck is driving by with twenty ki's
Because they came up with a law
To keep the rich motherfuckers rich and the poor motherfuckers poor
We take the cake you get the crumbs
Stacking up a package of cracks to sell to blacks in the slums
Guns are being sold over the counter
And you wonder why your daughter's head was slaughtered when they found her
Why did he have to shoot the bitch
But the bitch, I mean the witch, just had to switch
To make the nigga Richie Rich
Yeah, so I'm throwing you the phrase
Believe me when I tell you motherfucking crime pays
