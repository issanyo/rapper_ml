Why?
(cause I'm fly)

It's not a lie
(cause I'm fly)

[ verse 1 ]
I just ride around town in my caddy seville
Lookin buff, pockets stuffed with a grin on my grill
Rollin up my tinted windows, raise my antenna
Cause I'm not only fly, but I'm a big bred winner
Girls in bikinis in my back seat
As I'm doin 95 down a one-way street
Got proof that I paid for everything I bought
So if a cop tries to stop me, i'ma take him to court
Jump out my big car puffin on a cigar
Make my girls wait on the corner while I step in the bar
First I walk through the door then I ( *spitting sound* ) spit on the floor
Give some money to the poor, because I always get more
Take off my black mink and order a drink
My pockets resemble manhattan bank
So on my big ropes is a gucci link
All the pretty girls wink and I tell em, you stink!
Yes, I act so conceited cause I'm a full-breeded
Money-makin, not jamaican, and no way that you could beat it
No, I won't say hello and I won't say hi
And if you ask me why
(why? ) cause I'm fly

[ verse 2 ]
No, I'm not high, like I said, I'm fly
Got a natural beauty ma beside my eye
I put my friends in a benz, I put my girls in pearls
Got the firmest epidermis with the silky curls
They call me pretty boy wihtout chips ahoy
This 86 audi is my brand-new toy
I don't gamble or bet, I just sip on a moÃ«t
Pull out my new blue bally's and my silk-suit set
Got a body like a boxer, the face of a god
'bout as pretty as a bitty, and I still hit hard
I carry on like a pimp, I even walk with a limp
In a fancy restaurant eatin lobbsters and shrimps
I bathe in champagne with a girl named elaine
In my jaccuzi with a uzi with suzy and jane
The ladies help me undress and start caressin my chest
Only big silk sheets on my fat matress
Whether with honey or not, I make money a lot
I always carry a knot, cause I'm a hi-jackpot
The millionaire of the year, and I'm a hell of a guy
And if you ask me why
(why? ) cause I'm fly

It's not a lie
(cause I'm fly)

[ verse 3 ]
Morning velours in gold, another bathrobe
I was the sweets of the street when I was 12 years old
I never searched for a wife, or worked a day in my life
Cause while you're hookin I'll be cookin, lookin sharp as a knife
So you can front if you want, cause in a matter of time
I'm headed straight for the top, and you'll be all on mine
Cause I'm mister spectacular, rich as a bachelor
Relax and count stacks as I max in my maxima
Fly negro, yes, that's me, bro
And when I play celo, I play for a kilo
My diamond rings glitter as I steer my almanetta
Chillin on my sofa with a dollar sign-sweater
The ruler, controller like the ayatollah
Snack on renola, then crack a cold cola
G rap and polo, your excellency, your highness
Just cuss or fuss, and I'll just bust your sinus
Countin my cash, plus mount my stash
Dump the cigarette ash on low-down trash
Marley's car is two-toned, and it's ended with chrome
And the bell telephone makes you feel at home
So remember kool g rap and his dj polo
We're the ones who made 'demo', and we're rockin the show
It's not a legend or fiction, it's not no lie
And if you ask me why
(why? ) cause I'm fly

[ marley marl ]
Yo yo yo yo..
Kool g, kool g
Yo man, tell me every time you walk down the street
Why don't those girlies let you walk by
Why?
(cause I'm fly)

Yo yo yo, kool g
You're a cool brother, man
Got all the girlies on yours
Tell me why
Tell me why
Tell me why
(cause I'm fly)

Yo, kool g, man
You're the flyest brother I know
Yo, why you got all the girlies on yours
Just tell me why
I wanna know why
(cause I'm fly)
