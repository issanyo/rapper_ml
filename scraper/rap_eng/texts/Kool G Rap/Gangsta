CHORUS: Gangsta, we keep it gangsta

VERSE 1: NECRO:
You're a government witness, no recovery for that sickness
Just discovery of your ligaments in shipments
To the District Attorney's office of business
Crooked officers will off you when I insist
Argyle jewels at high profile mob trials
They won't get me behind bob wires
My fam's connected, blam your neck, kid
Leave you naked for the detectives
Fucked your wiz with the lamb protective
Everyone dead, the plan's objective
Go to Miami and tan my erection
Organized crime
Get your organs organized in the morgue for droppin dimes
Made my bones, I put blades to domes for daps
Fumigate rats, carefully communicate on phones
Inconspicuous on the blistering strips
You grill me, I'll kill you like Al Capone's syphilis
A shiv in your ribs for being chivalrous
Jigged in your liver over frivolous trivial shit
The Necro social club, Kosher Nostra
With the snub-nosed toaster, Sosa, shoot up your local pub
Pistol whip ya mandible with the grip handle
Enter your skull through your skully for pulling a Sammy the Bull
I'm intangible
You're a flammable flamboyant fag in the can
Your panties got pulled

BRIDGE:
Gangsta x2
We keep it gangsta
Giacana
Gangsta
Necrodamus
It's the Godfathers of the gangster death rap/ We keep it gangsta
Criminal gang, pop them thangs
Nec and G Rap make your brains hang
Run up on you, pop your top hops
Llamas, choppers, fuck all coppers x2

VERSE 2: KOOL G RAP:
Thug impression player, iron press your blazer
Put him in press papers, EMS, press your chest to save ya
Fuck you tryina impress, get hooked to respirators
Cranium x-rayers, brainwave displayers
Leave your brain like Rain Man's in the rain and lay ya
Fish knife fillet ya, you Fisher-Price, I'm Guy Fisher type
Fishermen rod to fish you later
G official as a fist-up Panther party
You get wheeled in a wheel chair, baby, pamper party
I slumber party your family
I'm part Hannibal breed, like animals deep in a dark safari
No Christopher Reeves get to breathe, you seed seller
I squeeze, fella, believe, bleed in a deep cellar
No sea sheller, them shells Felony B's, fella
You see, fella? no he fell in the weeds, fella
Not convinced, sell your bullshit to retailers
Way too frail, you trail me? you see failure
Go view some trailers
You're too used to fiction, it's crucifixion, bitch I'll nail ya

CHORUS:
Gangsta
We keep it gangsta
We'll bitch smack ya with the gat
Gangsta
We keept it gangsta
Bitch smack, bitch smack you with the gat
Criminal gang, pop them thangs
Nec and G Rap make your brains hang
Run up on you, pop your top hops
Llamas, choppers, fuck all coppers x2
