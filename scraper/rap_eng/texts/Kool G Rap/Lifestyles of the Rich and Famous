[ Chorus ]
I hop into the hot tub
To lay back and relax and get a scrub and a back rub
Sippin on some wine
The view is dope, you see the Manhattan skyline
I got it made in the game
No stress, no worries, the only pain is the champagne
Put on the silk bathrobe
I liveth the life, plus I been around the globe
Throw on a Barry White tape
While girls file my fingernails and feed me grapes
Step on a paddy-o and look at the city
No need to look for a girl, I got three right here with me
I'm gettin paid all at once
And I got money in jackets I didn't wear in five months
Nothin come up but fast bread
And I be countin it all while I'm layin in a brass bed
I got a maid and a chauffeur
Girls comin over, sit on a plush leather sofa
I got a smile on my face
Bank accounts and Chase group signings inside my pillow case
Now I'm livin kinda fat
Cause I came from the street and made a g with a rap
Now you know what my name is
G Rap livin the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

[ Chorus ]
(I'm representin, puttin Queens on the map)	--] Mr. Cheeks
G Rap livin the lifestyles of the rich and the famous
(I'm representin, puttin Queens on the map)
(Playin big willie style with the chauffeur
Yaknawmean?)						--] Junior M.A.F.I.A

[ VERSE 2 ]
Lookin TV, which one you wanna watch, gee?
Cause I got Sony, JVC, Magnumvox and Hitachi
See high prices are little to me
My suits are suede, plus robes are made in Italy
Spendin money like water
Rich men across the border offer me their daughter
And I'm never in a slump
Cause my big pockets got more lumps than Donald Trump's
Pretty women in my face, see
Took Gayle to Bloomingdale's and met Tracy at Macy's
Suckin on money like a vacume
Never got it hard, cause I got credit cards that are platinum
Not to mention the gold Visa
Got a safe in the wall behind paintings of Mona Lisa
Chandeliers in the hall
Ten stuffed deer heads are on my living room wall
More bills than Stills & Nash
I like to flash, cause I got more stash than Johnny Cash
Gold faucets on my sinks
Inside of my bedroom I got at least 20 fish tanks
I got power, and I'm known
See, I can call the President up straight on that red phone
So now you know what my game is
It's the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

[ VERSE 3 ]
I get the opposite sex
Cause while I write out checks, diamonds are shinin in my Rolex
My clout is outrageous
I'm on the phone with the owners of casinos in Las Vegas
Lookin heavy every day
I wear a pair of shoes once, and I'm throwin em away
Everything is like a breeze
I hired MP's just to guard all my ki's
Girls throwin lillies in my path
I got a yacht that makes the Love Boat look like a life raft
Mega-mega-mega-bucks
To make a deposit, I gotta call up armored trucks
Smilin while I'm stylin
I gave a girl her first lesson in sex on the Virgin Islands
Cause I'm the real money maker
More bread than a baker, the dead-president undertaker
A young brother gettin notes
I flew to London for the fog, just because I had the coat
So much money to spill
Whoever's not in my will might even get a mill
You want a car? That's miniture
No cash, don't sweat it, because my credit is my signature
My name should be Amos
Cause I'm livin the lifestyle of the rich and the famous
