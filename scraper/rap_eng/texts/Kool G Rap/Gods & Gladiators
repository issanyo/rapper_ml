[Verse 1: Ironic]

I keep coming like 300, led by Leonidas
Old Testament violence, vengeance, thunder and lightening Hell-fire and brimstone, clash of the titans
Hold a mic like Possession's trident , half viking, half lycan
Reel wolf in the field, burying barbarians
Sheepskin on my back as I clap at your chariot
Ghost Rider, the whip come through the arena
Control the coliseum; all hail Julius Caesar!
Witness the rebirth of Prime Minister Pete Nice
Heart froze, with the burner ignite, I am from ice
Effectively, deception scheme, perfect treachery like weaponry
Pretend that I am at rest, just beheading my enemies, relentlessly
Amateurs can't match this military strategist
Semi-automatic cannons blast on behalf of the spatial masochist
Illuminate the road to the masochist as haters
Remains burn, the gladiator days have returned

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]

KGR the conqueror I'm like Attila the Hun
Slay niggers and chill while they hunting and chill them for fun Murder, rape, pillage the slums ten seconds
For the villa's to run and decapitate all the militant ones
Giancana state, I was never really fond of that place
Nigga, my sword penetrate through your armor plate
I will put my fist through your skull like it was Thor's hammer
Make your whore stand up and let my horse slam her
Put your kids in the hands of mans with poor manners
More of a chance to get thrown in pits with fours panthers
Better pray I let them live; hope the lord answers
Biggest legion in the region; we casual door rammers

[Verse 3: Swifty McVay]

I'am the top dog, you can't compare this Mossberg to a sharp sword
I'll have a angle playing the harp for em
A warrior, striking with the force of a harpoon
I'm stabbing your abdomen, my aim is immaculate
No matter how many men you have in your clique i'm clapping this gat and sending them back
Flipping as accurate as an Olympic medalist
Blow their head of their shoulders; having them rolling like boulders in avalanches
Cold as a aspinse when assassinating bastards; grabbing them with the strength of Samson
This mag is sagging in my pants dragging my scrotum sac through the avenue laughing
My head spinning like Tasmanian Devil after the jagermeister and yack attack my bladder
It's a matter of life and death tampering with this bastard
Cancelling any successive backstabbers; I cut em faster
Than a aggressive cancer before it travels
