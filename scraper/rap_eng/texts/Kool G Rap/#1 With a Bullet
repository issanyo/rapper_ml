[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
The last time I caught a body it was recent
Gimme a HK, four banana clips, and I'll take on a precinct
Yeah, the murder rate is on the rise, with niggas like me
Steady poppin, niggas are droppin like flies
To get em up when I hit em I hit em hard, there'll be no get well card
Niggas straight to the motherfuckin graveyard
Cause me no wanna get undone
Me pickin the one and lickin em up and hit em up for fun
He thought them bullet hit me but him didn't get none
You better run son, because me beginnin to get the gun
Yo, murder me, you musta heard of me
And if you get rushed to emergency, I'm shootin niggas in surgery
Another nigga life is took
I'll be at your wake motherfucker signin my name on that book
Inside the morgue another body freezes
It's one more bitch nigga that was sent to meet Jesus
"Come on down!" "Whassup nigga?"
No ambulence, just paramedics scrapin your brains off the street
So yeah motherfucker come get a taste
Cause I'mma give your punk ass my two in face and beat the case
My finger's on the trigger, I'mma pull it
So now you know that Kool G Rap is number one with a bullet

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
A one man gang to bring the bang
So the next nigga can't even hang, yang yang yang yang
You know my style, and know my pedigree
You can ask Saddam Hussein about me
I'm never to let a brother bass
And if you bring on a crew, I hope the bitches saw Scarface
Cause I'mma send em to the morgue
Six feet under, gettin their mail from the groundhog
Cause I'm the wrong brother to push
When put to the test, I go to war like George Bush
And I got apartments to give
The landlord of the morgue, now who need a place to live?
I'm rough and tough, the man on the scene
The baddest the maddest, you know the routine
I flip and rip, to set the rank
The coolest in rulin the gangsta lean
I got my gat to your dome and I'mma pull it
I'm number motherfuckin one with a bullet

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
Niggas are wavin white flags, then dragged
In a hospital bed, full of lead, with a shit bag
You get a slug in your mug
Just give him a kiss and a hug, I pull the mother, "flatline"
I'm fuckin him up I'm buckin him up all properly
No poppin me is stoppin me even if he go look out for me
I'm quicker to flicker the nigga the trigger is the plan for me
You try to run me comin to kill the whole family
Cause in the city there's no pity or no sympathy
You gotta hem em up, and now you're just a memory
Yeah nigga, I leave em done when I hit em
When pussy comes to get em, tell em Kool G Rap did em
With my fingers on the trigger I'm Terminatin like umm..
(Who Schwarzenegger?) Yeah that nigga!
So fuck all the bullshit
You know a nigga's number one with a bullet
