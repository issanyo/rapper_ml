[Verse 1: Big Noyd]
Yeah, yeah
You know Queens is in the building
But niggas be chillin’ at the round table building
The robberies and killers, man
They ran up in the spot
Knew the Glock was in the ceiling
Sad niggas in the hood, get down for the millions
They bust gats, some rap, some be dealing
But watch out for them thugs, you don’t wanna fuck with em
’cause niggas real grimy, you have to fucking kill em
They living like life just wiped his ass with em
Just niggas strung out, have your gun out when you see em
That do money hungry, you wouldn't wanna be em
You stick it for 500 and flip it to a G
Put dope in the bags and sell it in the streets
You known as a hustler, watch it, he a cut ya
Dig in your pockets, turn around and gun but ya
Money game when your grain is street hustler
Yeah, bad motherfucker
I’m a naturally born hustler
We don’t get caught up in between

[Hook]
Boss, got a hustler to hustler
Some hustlers naturally born with street smarts
I’m a naturally born hustler
I’m a queen stand represent to the fullest
Boss, got a hustler to hustler
Some hustlers naturally born with street smarts

[Verse 2: Large Professor]
Bangin’ on them past, hangin on them ass, ringing on that ass
Rip hard the street slash my professional
Yeah we still sparing in them vestibules, beating niggas
Leavin them like garden investitures
Tryin to stay up while everybody doing bad
Make a little lag, get low down like both stags
It’s too many brothers
Walk around get smothered for the every day word
Play game out the skeleton, lots of cash underneath lots of ash
Where our forefathers used to flame box and flash
For the cameras, light bar vila with the hammers
Too much beef, forget the motherfucking sandwich
From both finish with no folks and no friends
The pain of having chocking about you more trends
Well I maintain on them blocks with oceans of love
Lost four still keeping it rob, get that money thunn

{Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]
I'm from NY where them niggas get that money
Call me the ventriloquist the way I talk with the dummy
Dummy, he ain’t running no side show at
Think is a game, till I buck one in your chest
And make your eyes go back
Repping Corona queens north of boulevard
You can let your chrome scream or you can get bullet scarred
You’re like just stay here, is nothing to pull the job
’cause niggas know the shit, come out that map fully hard
But not far very take notice, you notice and learn to focus your harm
Niggas watching what time, niggas only rely, no harder desamble
Real dirty with it, niggas who leave your ass for somebody to find you
Here you get no weber on the front it
You even hustle enough the.., the man is shaking down something
..shake body way on the way down something
For real telling you boy you’d better move at the function

[Hook x 2]
