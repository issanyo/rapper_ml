[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Yeah, you know the clique move deep as the Red Sea
7:30 like a nigga be on PSP
Be in VIP, VSOP doing it B-I-G
Nigga you know me
Soon as the motherfucking jakes on him he low key
Take a little journey O-T where that dough be
The fifth on him
I O-D like the O-D the fish on him
Brim of the hat to the nose piece the chicks on him
Some wild hoes, in wild style clothes
They download and videotape 'em like al po
The wild road facing the chair if the trial blow
That's with the best friends and the sounds Tical knows
Know that killers come with calm faces
Shakes and hugs ace with gloves
Hate from love the traits of thugs
Snake like characteristics
Me, Big J, R.A gun barrels get lifted

[Hook]
3 kings, there ain't no snatching our crowns
We be them 3 kings, we here to fracture you clowns
3 kings, Big John, Rugged Man and G Rap
Talking trash, no talking back, we slaughter you cats

[Verse 2: R.A the Rugged Man]
Who the master in the rap game? Thorburn last name
Reigning smacking attacking ya brain aiming back with the flame
Attract pain and learn from the best murdering burning the rest
We ain't no GQ rappers like Pharrell or Kanye West
I'm an abomination, I'm bombing a nation's population
You just a chick with a dick without no operation
I'm barely eating badly beaten, beaten badly in the precinct
I'm the hardest that God ever gave the privilege of speaking
Frantically banning me, Rugged Man'll panicky that'd be fantasy
Loaded hammer he handing me blabber the bragger be
A man who'd be damned if he happily married with family
Splatter ya mammy mammary gland insane insanity anarchy
Swagger the rapper the biter biting his flattery
Beating buzzing you battery agony back to reality
Bring it back you deliver that pitiful pitter pat
Pull the trigger snitch hit a rat you wick-wick-wack

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big John]
Decapitation vaccination Big John ain't no mental patient
Been on medication ever since the day I could talk
You want a sedative you can drink the blood from my heart
We magnificent glistening banging bitches while we christening
You kelters and helters we here to body you cowards
My occupations slaughtery for wack rappers who try and bother me
You not as hot as me, Big John it gotta be
Exceptional technical poison pumping through my ventricles
I'm fresh in 0-7 those battles pseudo-intellectuals
Y'all faggots get smashed quick, for rapping that wack shit
Chop with the hatchet throw it in the trunk of a black whip
You can't imagine my passion combined with rapping adaption
And with the comic book caption reads I'm the bombest kid rapping
I smack cliques with wack writs cause really they that bitch
Big John, Giancana stuff bricks in the mattress
Fuck with R.A and I'm leaving you backless
