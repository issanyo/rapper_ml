[Verse 1]
And once again it's big G, runnin the number rackets
Wearin Pelle jackets
Fast loot tactics, I'm well up in the millionaire bracket
The boss of all bosses, I own racehorses and a fortress
Corridors with olympic torches and Mona Lisa portraits
Jacuzzis and saunas then eatin steak at Benihana's
Bentley's, limousine, the front yard stream is full of pirahnas
I'm set, a private jet, I drink a lot of Beck's
Get a lot of sess, condo and duplex, diamond infested Rolex
Deliver a crown at the Wall Unitâ€™s with Silver China
Sippin on finer wine-r you see more shines than diamond miners
The Highness, kingpin of heroin
I'm thorough when I have to bring the terror in
Handle business in each and every borough in
Town or city, I'm rollin like Frank Nitti, I'm rich and pretty
Back up kiddies, I got crimies that's grimy and gritty
A nigga that's spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky
Makin most of my money, from all the dopefiends and junkies
I learned from the best the ones that's livin
And the ones that's put to rest
So I bless my chest with a vest and pack a Smith-N-Wes
And then I'm off to get the snaps, not the scraps
The game is be a real mack, the name is Kool G Rap

[Hook]
Now it's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler

[Verse 2]
I got a fly ho up under the wing, a swinger that does her thing
And if you step inside my ring, she'll bang it out and make your brains hang
She sits at resteraunt tables with mink foxes and sables
Drinkin Charentes brand label she'll rock a sucker's cradle
And yeah, honey gets more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down ho, a Foxy Brown ho, standin her ground ho
And if you clown yo she'll turn into a bust a round ho
Fly as a Heaven's Angel got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hang n dangle gettin money from all angles
She's pretty under the New York city bright lights
And real late, way after midnight, I hit it cause the slit's tight
Wake up early and make my rounds, break a brick down
Packin a silver four pound, some clowns be trying to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes
Them slick stick up kids don't get no free dough bro
Cause I ain't tryin to be broke
I goes all out for G Rap and this honey nothin funny
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do to get the money

[Hook]

Ain't no sweet hangover (x8)
