[Intro: Kool G Rap, Willie the Kid & Crooked I]
It's your boy King Kong
Willie the Kid
ECP [?], nigga
Crooked I, what up my nigga?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
See I'mma section eight baby, comin' up I had to scrap hard
No American Express, just a EBT snap card
Dropped out, I was sick of school, I just wanna stack large
Then I dropped a jacuzzi and swimmin' pool in my back yard
Long Beach to Liverpool, I'm smokin' the Church Hill
Thinkin' about the days I was raised because it hurts still
This is like the Bible and Quran, every verse real
I ain't talkin' breakfast when I say I seen my first meal
Y'all rappin' prima donnas can't see me and G and [?]
We piranhas
I can get a [?] from Tijuana
Catch me in the heated suana with a [?] sippin' [?] jalatas
If I'm speakin' dollars and commas, you gotta beat it, momma
I'm just a nigga from a broken home who hold his own
Talkin' cold on burned out mobile phones and totin' chrome
With the thieves and the bandits, can you please understand it?King Crooked, I own the deed to this planet
The world is mine, ya dig?

[Chorus: Pearl Gates]
La-da-da
Shouldda known the world was mine with all this dough and all this shopping, chocolate syrup, the whole nine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Shouldda known the world was mine, [?] the words across the lot so I can touch a gold mine
All mine, all mine, all mine

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
G on that old school vibe, nigga, like [?] Morris
Panamera Porsches blind [?] like Farrah Fawcett
Silky pleasure palace [?] all in my [?]
[?] thing on niggas like [?]
Like in Vegas, I walk away with the [?]
Sugar Hill, nigga couldda filled [?]
He in position like diagrams and karate charts
Cuban cigars, Ménage à trois, and body sparks
My bottle momma got body parts like she Dolly Part'
Victoria Crown car parked in the rally cars
Shit [?] even matter, my diamonds shine in the cloudy parts
It's team Crooked I, bullets fly, [?]
The world is mines, crazy [?] he got that heart of [?]
So follow that, holler back, we on that dollar chase
Some wildin' states niggas laid back on a pile of cake
And any [?] be a [?] on a balance tray
The world is mine, ya dig?

[Chorus: Pearl Gates]
La-da-da
Shouldda known the world was mine with all this dough and all this shopping, chocolate syrup, the whole nine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Shouldda known the world was mine, [?] the words across the lot so I can touch a gold mine
All mine, all mine, all mine

[Verse 3: Willie the Kid]
Lullabies, double lives, then it squeeze four-fives
Them lemon soda, Promethazine niggas
Told 'em to hold my niggas shinin'
GS been to [?] VS Diamonds, coppin' no consignment
When sendin' money for commissary my niggas committed
Catch a body in Sarasotam, convicted [?]
Forever young, [?], crackin' the stroller
Diaper bag blood money, scrub it like a loofah
For European loafers and loose bitches with tight pussy, I bend 'em over
Send some bottles over
Let's make a toast to hood legends who dead and gone
So get the money be gone, don't overstay your welcome
Fuck stuntin', I overspend
They can't stand to see a nigga workin' his plan
I planned to put plenty people in position to get it
Pile of plush furcoats, the winter time is so frigid
Countin' digits in the blizzard, get it how you live it
Yeah

[Chorus: Pearl Gates]
La-da-da
Shouldda known the world was mine with all this dough and all this shopping, chocolate syrup, the whole nine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Shouldda known the world was mine, [?] the words across the lot so I can touch a gold mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
