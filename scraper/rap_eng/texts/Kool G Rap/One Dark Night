[Kool G. Rap]
Last night, got caught in a gunfight, I think it was like
Four niggas clutchin they burners and bustin
But only could see one in sight
The one on my right, yo son he like we both got gripe
He wanted my life, come at a nigga
With a gun and a knife
He tryin to make me the wiped out nigga layin up under the white
But I ain't tryin to go up in no dark tunnel
And burn to the light
And let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night
And done in on sight, and tryin to breathe
With one in my pipe
But I'm not one of the type, and I'd rather lose all hung on the mic
Than to be up in the yard receivin CPR
At one in the night
Now I can run and take fllght, but alright, yo son'll be hyped
And I've played mother nature before
So yo I'm clappin thunder tonight
I step right, inside of the street light, my gun it was bright
Send him to kiss Christ, and let my shit slice
In front of him twice
Let one splice, cause fuckin with price, ain't tryin to be nice
I want him on ice, no back home
To a son and a wife
He tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice
Nigga was all enticed to lead his life sheist
But none of it's nice
I peeped shit, and seen his whole click, was runnin in fright
Instead of comin to fight, get someone to fight
You son of a dykes
With one in the pipe, I'm aimin to light the one on the right
They all deceased, so yo my asspiece
Get hunted for life
Four niggas cut down, and I can receive one hundred to life
Up in a jailcell, that's crawlin with lice
And runnin with mice
Live trife, fillin appetities with nothin but rice
Slow biz and no kid's nigs
Start runnin my wife
Only got one life, yo get this fuckin, gun outta my sight
Back at the house, after midnight
I'm done for the night
