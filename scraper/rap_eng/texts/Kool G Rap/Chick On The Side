Don't touch me! get away from me!
Homeboy, you better stop it, keep up you're gonna get it
Your mouth is gettin' sassy, don't make me have to hit it
'cause when I heard about you my teeth just gritted
You told me that you didn't, but I knew you were with it

[Chorus:]
Bet you got a chick on the side
Sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side
(love bandit, love bandit)
(repeat)

Don't worry, boy, 'cause I won't complain, no need to explain
I seen everything through the window pane
You and your other lover, that's really insane
And another thing: please take off my gold ring
I got another finger I can put it on
You blew the deal so now I'm all gone
I was prepared for just in case you messed around
On the side you could be replaced
But you could have found a better way of lettin' me down
Instead of running around with every girl in town
I heard you on the phone the other day
Don't you say it's an old friend all the way from l.a
I finally caught onto your little game
Your lying and denying is a cryin' shame
You took me for granted, this is the end, dammit
You're playing the field like you're some (love bandit)

[Chorus]

Oooo my, oooo my so-called fiancee listen to what I say
Whatever game you play I play the same way
So if you wanna go mess around and cheat
And you wanna romance between another girl's sheets
Go ahead sweetheart, I expected that
'cause you're nothing but a cheap, little, stuck-up brat
Wherever you're at you want this and that
You dirty rat, I'm not a welcome mat
I got another lover, and I know he cares
So smile child, but keep your crocodile tears
Go ahead, go, go boy! I'm going steady
In loving arms this teddy is ready
He fixed the table for his and hers
And while the dinner simmers he served the hors'doevres
Then munch-out time, hit the wine, get mellow
Cleared off the table and his hello-jello
I can't express the feeling that I get
So I just lay back and light up a cigarette
And try to be cool, collected, and calm
He tells me my fortune and reads my palm
With a suave taste I cannot embrace
In a feeling of desire by the fireplace
Love bandit, I'm makin' it clear
See ya later, gator, I'm gettin' outta here, yeah

[Chorus]

You're at the window starin' at the sky
Birds fly by, you start to wonder why
You're not by my side sharing the dream
That one day you'll be my king, and I'll be your queen
I call you every day, ask to get into your home
I tell you I'm alone, but you hang up the phone
You're like a hot flame getting ready to burn
You say you're concerned, baby, you don't earn
