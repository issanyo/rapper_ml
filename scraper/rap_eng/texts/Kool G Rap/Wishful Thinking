What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
Once you rule the world every girl will want to be with you
First I get the money then I get the power
B-Real of the hill eliminate the guitars

Thinkin' of takin' a plane
To take a flight out to the red light
And smuggle 10 pounds of weed
Make it home tonight
Be the number 1 smuggler in the area
Got enough weed to fill up and air craft carrier
Erb slanger, Hasila Incorporated
State to state and over seas gettin' faded
Buddah king had seen the green proton
I'm bringing it on right back home to Don
Many different strains of erb in my brain
I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane
Skunk and the one chocolate ty bud
Niggas lets get high in the sky hit the blunts
And the bongs, fill up the lungs, niggas don't stop
Fools get sprung when they get there smoked up for crops
Like gettin' props, where all the soldiers in the board
Yo what would you do if the world was yours

What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
First I get the money then I get the power
Joey crack twist the caps enemy's I devour

Yo it's only a dream 16 battin' Beamers and Benz's
Lying penance with diamonds ill as lacin' in a face with avengances
Having blocks on in the lava parts dome
My mankind with crime is how you shine if you can't rhyme
Dime droppers will give ya fad time if you sleep
But momma single be mastera heater on city streets
In the east I be known as Don Cartegena
Claimin' the ? like ?
Lacin' the china with Menida
To seller need repeater or be a leader
Like a preacher or presume a steeper
Peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don
Until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nikki Vons
Come on I be the top extortionist
Adopt adopted foster kids right out the mothafuckin' orphanage
Yea, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof
All my peeps in the streets know I speak the truth

What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
First ya get the money then you get the power
G Rap bustin' the gats slangin' last by every hour

No doubt
I be the crime story of all ghetto territory's
Soldiers at war be blowin' up niggas like glory
With pharmaceutical lavatory's
Major to chemistry, PHD in streetology
Degree in drug industry
Combinin' H²O with matter from crack batter
Rest it through molecules scatter
Launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter
Mind bitin' an arm starts a crime
G equals and MC dat ain't near the square son I gets mine
But yo the kill the fill with force fields and shields
And holy steel, a nigga keep it real
You know the deal, if the stakes ain't to high for me to grab
I got's to have, stack all the cabbage
From constructin' a drug traffic
Police a jam me in try to find a new pot to frame me in
Armenians so I resort the evil thoughts like Damien
This flame of fury to the D-A and the jury
A hundred grand the judges hammer slams I'm a free man

What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
First ya get the money then you get the power
Big Pun's the same son bustin' my guns for the Dollars

Yo, I'm walkin' waters
Spit fire and shit Häagen-Dazs
Idolize no man like Conan and stand beside the guards
Be larger than life, twice as nice as ya idol
Pump you with pride, then guide you str8 to hell like the bible
I'm lible to start manipulatin' minds infiltratin' clown
'm out the pitfalls of life entice with nickle plated nine
It seems every time I'm dream I'm in a nightmare of fiend
Livin' a world of mothers and queens and men would fight fare
(Hell Yea!) I wish I could, I wish I could
Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit I'm just a hood
Yo I change my life make my wife and get the chance for the pain
And physical abuse, give her back her best years
Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement
Spark the scent, and cloud the sky till my heart's content
Repent and vow she be forgiven
How could we be proud to live in a world
Which condemns man, child, to women
Child to women
