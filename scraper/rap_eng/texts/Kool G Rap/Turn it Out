Ridin to the club, candy coated on the dubs
What? What? We gon' burn out, burn out
What? What? We gon' turn it out, turn it out
Nobody do it like G do it when he do it
Ridin to the club, candy coated on the dubs
What? What? We gon' burn out, burn out
What? What? We gon' turn it out, turn it out
Nobody do it, if beef do it, we see through it

[Verse 1]
You see me coming with the roof up leaning
Work on the block, I got the whole strip steaming
Grab a stack from the stash for the evening
Round it up with the click, now we breezing
Chrome glowing, the low pros all seasoned
Cuties stay blowing the do' for no reason
What we spend on {?} alone can buy a Hummer truck
Next week we up, chronic, hit the numbers up
Get trucked up, the weapon in the stomach tucked
Click on point, my gun is never blunted up
Realise man, the 5 Fam running stuff
And my guys playing many men that want it rough
But we really came to flash on cats
And peep out a of couple ass on backs, smash on that
Shook nice cigars, jump the ash on cats
Thirty deep, V.I.P., in the back all that
Throw my drink in a chick's face that act all wack
Ladies move, fix your attitude, get back on track
Any problem with me leaving niggas back up back?
And we lay last like Crack-A-Jack, put cash on that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Straight gully, I give you that impression at the door
Slut's chain, just came from dressing at the store
And grown man cologne, shit exit out the pores
Best up the front, Smith & Wesson in the draws
Give coupons, freaks come a dime a dozen
Then key shine, you could turn a dime to a dozen
Back in this bitch right when you thought I wasn't
It's 5 Family Click, we all about thugging
You ain't bout money, you all about nothing
The timely fetish, the lines of credit
Get this money and tell a dime to spread it
Playing with mines will fill this place with potent nines and medics
That's right, that little light up on the nine is reddish
The shorty in that Louis Vuitton line is precious
Whole place filled with behind suppressors
Might get the wrinkles out the way, I iron their dresses
