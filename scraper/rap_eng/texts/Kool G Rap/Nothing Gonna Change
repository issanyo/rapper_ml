[Verse 1: 38 Spesh]
Yeah
Now since an early age I always kept me a cannon
And tell a bitch open your legs, let me examine
I don't give a fuck if that bitch sexy as Janet
Have a call in the .... (?) like he left me abandoned
Y'all expect me to vanish
We successfully manage money, trees, emcees, we collectively planned it
My homie Phils hopped on a plane and left the Atlantic and landed on a beach somewhere, slept on a hamlet (?)
We was just runnin' the streets, stretchin' and gamblin'
Out of town trips, I got arrested for scramblin'
I ain't turned bitch for the judge, kept me remanded
No barb (?) and the chips, you only get what'chu handed
Our finances gave me extra advantage 'cause when you broke, your girl be less understandin'
The car that I'm drivin' require special mechanics
There's a fridge in the vehicle, bitch, fix you a sandwich

[Hook: Emanny]
To the sky 'til the day we die
And either when I'm gone in the ground I lie
Ain't nothin' gon' change us
I grew up in the game and I'mma always stay the same
Ain't nothin' gon' change us
I be the same 'til the day I die
Ain't nothin' gon' change us
I grew up in the game and I'mma always stay the same

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
Feel me
I go through the motions, I give my students .... (?)
Spit pimp code and flow like the bluest oceans
I get it in the guards head like its through the Sultan (?)
Real jewels, I tell the straight faces (?) smooth as velvet
Bitch respect your elders, put your lips to the this helmet
Right on top of this hot dog like a scoop of relish
Tell your crew I hire yellas, I'm with my rude fellas
Marriott suites, starin' straight in to the room and yell this
Nothing but major players, all my niggas paper rakers
Presence of royalty around you in the face cakers (?)
Some of my niggas engaged the capers and made the papers
Ages of seventeen, niggas seen the ..... Lakers (?)
Cold blocks, took 'em to stove tops to bake a wafer
.... (?) rocks straight to the chest and never taste a chaser
Shit I copped from my jeweler, look into and tell your future
Tell no tales, I scoop you off the ............ (?)

[Hook: Emanny]
To the sky 'til the day we die
And either when I'm gone in the ground I lie
Ain't nothin' gon' change us
I grew up in the game and I'mma always stay the same
Ain't nothin' gon' change us
I be the same 'til the day I die
Ain't nothin' gon' change us
I grew up in the game and I'mma always stay the same
Ain't nothin' gon' change us
Ain't nothin' gon' change us
