[Intro: 38 Spesh]
Hey yo, G, I know the place where he kept all the keys
At his bitch house and she live next door to Steve
We can pave the driveway and wait for him to leave
If the nigga hesitate he gon' catch one of these, lets go

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
No doubt, we 'bout the slum boss, C4 his front door
Rollin' Mollys on white tile floors, this nigga lifestyle raw
Peruvian whore in a night gown and drawers
Right in front of this nigga I'ma pipe down her jaws
For real deal, I heard he keep the cake up in the wall safe
Went to the stripper, him and his bitch, like it was all safe
30 get that rope ready before that coke fetti
This nigga throat heavy, truck like the whole Chevy
Screw your silencer tight, keep the four pound to your right
My cover lefty (Lefty)
Southpaw is deadly (Deadly)
Damn, this nigga guest room sweet, Armani bed sheets
We gettin' close to his room, I heard the bed squeek
Whoever step they foot out of this bitch is dead meat
Hold up, let me take a look through the keyhole (No doubt)
The lights is dim but, hold up, I see they feet though (Right there)
This nigga walkin' on the balcony in Coney slippers (Coney slippers)
Shorty stomped from liquor, look how many stones he give her (Damn)
They swimmin' in a money river, wrists born with glitter (Word)
She move a muscle I'ma hit her like she Tony's sister

[Verse 2: 38 Spesh]
He don't know me, mister
Grab the nigga put the toast around him
She in the back beatin' his bitch with the broken bottle
I held the gun as I inquire about the coke and dollars
Tried to be quiet but I beat him 'til he spoke about it
Here go the sirens, somebody called [?]
The thought of goin' back upstate increased my heart rate
Then G said, "Yo, yo, they comin' down the hallway"
So I started shootin' at the doorway
Fuck they expect? I'ma die 'fore I'm under arrest
Then I woke up covered in sweat, somethin' ain't right
I mean I had a helluva night
Had a dream that me and the G went on a heist, huh
