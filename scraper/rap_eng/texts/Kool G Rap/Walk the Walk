[Chorus]
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Talking loud and saying nothing

[Verse 1: Tone Chop]
A lot of rappers like to talk the talk
But the truth is they don't really walk the walk
They paint an image to the fans that's really not them
'Til they get exposed and their future looks grim
Why lie, it's better to speak the truth
And you cats with ghost writers, let me speak to you
How you pay the next man to write your rhymes
You're a fraud, you should lose your right to rhyme
I'm the truth, I'm a shine like expensive jewels
I write my own rhymes, you're going against the rules
That's b/s, you should be ashamed of yourselves
You a lame and ain't nobody to blame but yourselves
I ain't fake, nah we can go hawk for hawk
'Til we both die and our bodies are chalked in chalk
Rip your tongue out so you can't talk the talk
And break your legs so you can't walk the walk

[Chorus]
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Talking loud and saying nothing

[Verse 2: Tone Chop]
A lot of rappers like to talk the talk
But the truth is they don't really walk the walk
They paint an image to the fans that's really not them
'Til they get exposed and their future looks grim
Just remember that the truth always comes to light
If you're tuff, why you act like a bitch?
And if you're broke with no money, why you act like you're rich?
You be stuntin' so I'm calling your bluff
If you got a Benz then why I see you riding the bus?
It's a must that I go at your head
If you gon' kill me, then answer me this, why I ain't dead?
I'm still breathing alive and well
Why you think I'm still here, 'cos many tried and fell

[Chorus]
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Talking loud and saying nothing

[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]
Nigga' find out if KGR don't walk the talk
I guarantee you coroners comin' to walk your corpse
My lyrics come to life when it's mandatory
Nigga' front and find out, the shit be self explanatory
Crazy as cat shit you put me in that category
I make sure it's a real shootin' and stabbin' story
I rock real Versace lenses, hop in Benz's
Menage-a-trois with some real poppin' wenches
I lost fam members to hot shit in syringes
Cousin survived multiple shots in his appendix
Still spring fills with mops like a janitor
Ran with some animals, known shooters and gamblers
Some faces never revealing on the cameras
Won't mention names but niggas vouching it's real here
Spilled beer for niggas in graveyards and wheelchairs
Had real years, a real couple of mil' years

[Chorus]
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Talking loud and saying nothing
