[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]

Summertime is hot, fly drops and tank tops
Corona, South side Queens blocks, it rains shots
QB to Woodhaven, niggas in hoods, blazing
Bitches in shorts, sass, thighs thick, ride dick
Guys with opposite tips sliding their shit
Funeral parlor flooded, cause that Luger so rugged
A young cannon pushed his brain out in the public
Foul dudes who circle round your food like buzzards, cousin
Money stashed, (?) assassins with double axis
Three to four masked men, ready to bust with passion
Real niggas move in silence without too much attraction
My ways are old fashioned, I wisened up, fuck the flashing
Don't try to register on nobody radar
Except for when he pop up with an AR, okay, y'all
With chaos, and gauge y'all like Adolf
The permanent payoff with the cage
Or leave your (?) off or leg off
Far from rocket science, nothing to pop the iron
Hold on a couple, get that off the muscle
Play yourself, get drum rolled, percussion, nigga fuck you
Have a bastard closed casket, cause the grim features
Pay me in blood, there's men sleeping, that spent liters
The shells get hot, get hit with intense fever
Real goons, saloon shit, come with ten squeezers
Summertime, temperature climb, hundred degree shit


[Hook: Gravity and Adil Omar]

You people got a lot to say
Stay the fuck out my way
Round after round hits the ground
No, you're not gonna get up

Buckshots go bang
Came to take everythang
Round after round, summertime
No, they're not gonna get us


[Verse 2: Gravity]

Just an emcee filled with anger
Hotter than a chicken and cheese chimichanga
Big dog, wigga, when I piss, lift my leg up
Ghetto drug dealer, yellow bricks like legos
If niggas wanna beef, we can take it out (?)
(?Spanish?) - means you suck penis
Scummy wants money, mommy bought me two bunnies
Then I gutted the fuzzy fucks and stuck 'em onto my feet
Gonna beat up the women if they don't wanna snuggle with me
Syrup and peanut butter on her juicy coochie, punchin' pussy
Sucker for motherfucking love, let's cuddle to a movie
Honey, bunny, put your punnani on my scummy salami, bologna
And watch your homie bust a nut, it's the color of money
On your tummy and in your belly button; lumpy
Got your gravy, baby, succulent, finger fucking
Pinky licking, (?) knuckle, baby, icky, sticky, yum, yucky

[Verse 3: Greydon Square]

Start new part two of star view in an art school
Get a bar stool if you start duel
My name should be read with a Cartouche in front of it
I wonder if any of my opponents can stomach it
I'm the one that's with colonel Sam Carter
We be out on dates planning our future granddaughters
She sneaks me off-world weed to jam harder
If I battled your crew, I'd be charged with manslaughter
Adil Omar, KGR plus the Greydon
Our legend's secure, while you're still trying to break in
These cats are worse than just actors, they're Reagans
Started off on the left but ended up on the pavement
Don't even have a soul, you're still trying to save it
Assassins on the run carrying hatchets that's makeshift
Bring your rudeness to the ludus and let's do this
You don't even bear the mark, facing me is stupid


[Hook: Gravity and Adil Omar]

You people got a lot to say
Stay the fuck out my way
Round after round hits the ground
No, you're not gonna get up

Buckshots go bang
Came to take everythang
Round after round, summertime
No, they're not gonna get us


[Verse 4: Adil Omar]

You could feel the heat from a suicide vest and if you choose to ride
Either way you lose, in the end you're gonna lose your life
Horrible perversion, regardless of conversion
Exploding supermarkets, false promises of virgins
Summertime sunshine, burning your skin
Saving Face, your saving grace will make you turn on your kin
A paranoid husband give a fuck about divorcing
Wife missing all her features in a tub of Hydrofluoric acid
You ain't ready for the static, cause when the drama spills
The scene changes to a motherfucking honor kill
Elite kids and their big fat wallets
Get snatched out their rides in a kidnap climate
Where the chicks at? - hide em, the predators out
It's gonna be a hot summer, if you're ever in doubt
That it's ugly, trust me, it's one of the worst
Just a deadly combination of hunger and thirst, summertime


[Hook: Gravity and Adil Omar]

You people got a lot to say
Stay the fuck out my way
Round after round hits the ground
No, you're not gonna get up

Buckshots go bang
Came to take everythang
Round after round, summertime
No, they're not gonna get us
