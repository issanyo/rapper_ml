[Verse 1]
Everything, anything, you know how that shit go
Made two moves I've been making for big dough
Heroin paradise making the strips snow
Young nigga slanging in front of the fish store
Leavin' needle marks in the arms of his hoes
Gun pack the cover of the chrome with his clothes
Flow make a dough fiend vomit the shit cold
Bad bitch shit at the bar, I'ma drink green
Get some insane mouth game in fifteen
Dom as a queen she know what a whip mean
My main man in here serving the head fiends
I'm a fly motherfucker the man of a chicks' dreams
Thirty large sit on the chest and her wrist gleam
Seen about half of her room on the trick beam
Money like Lennox 116
No doubt I'm in it to win it and get cream

[Hook x2]
For the love of the game
Fast lane, won't you tell them my name (G RAP)
Beginning to the end, city of sin
We bout to win, he get it in

[Bridge]
I'm in too deep, linen blue sheets
To get through sleep gotta sleep with two freaks
Run with two heats 'cause the streets do speak
No exit out the game yeah I'm in too deep

[Verse 2]
I'm like, Ron O'Neal and Tony Alvarez
That's why she call me Daddy I'm the only holy father
Gator suits gettin' lined up at the barber
They see me as that nigga in the streets goin' harder
No dough, for my whole belief I'm a starver
Understand it's worth if the plan works perfect
Curvy bodies on the curb standing in that purse shit
The man want me in the can, gotta stay alert with it
Coke cash stacks, and, slow-fast action
Here's wave at the caddy when I roll past Jackson
Real about my paper showin no compassion
Let her blow my dick hear the hoe go attachin'
Bitch run atrapped and we all know what happened
Let her live abit, I'm a slow mode assassin
Long barrel strapped and not one for the chattin'
Plenty up in this table let a hoe off the wagon

[Hook x2]
For the love of the game
Fast lane, won't you tell them my name (G RAP)
Beginning to the end, city of sin
He bout to win, he get it in

[Bridge]
I'm in too deep, linen blue sheets
To get through sleep gotta sleep with two freaks
Run with two heats 'cause the streets do speak
No exit out the game yeah I'm in too deep
