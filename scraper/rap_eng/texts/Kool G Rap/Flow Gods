[Intro: Meyhem Lauren]
Yeah, yeah
Uhh
A-K-A Laurenavichi

[Verse 1: Meyhem Laruen]
Shake the dead weight and elevate
Money can sail away
Sling perico complicates and then we celebrate
Basically the way that I move, systematically
Copper tops pop at your top and stop your battery, anatomy
Tougher than fly shit, my pedigree
Any nobody fallin' off, Lord, my nigga let it be
I rep for niggas pushing sevens, holdin' hammers
You worried about the beef, I’m worried about the cameras
Cash only, no reservations
Gotta lack of patience when we dealin' with the patients
24 carat gold, margaritas, that Versace
Power-moves, always get smooth, you couldn't stop me

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
Yo, I was turnin' Benjamins before you heard the riches
I was Big Percy pimpin’ with the curvy bitches
I was in the dirty picture, nigga, dirty pissin’
Mink coat, furry mittens with the blurry wristses
That bitch hurry with the chicken, catch a flurry, slippin'
Luciano lifestyle flick with the Persian kitten
Shook bit this nigga, blonde bitch slurpin' dickin’
Dead man tell no tales, never heard a witness
Pistol from the hip make em’ give it Hershey Kisses
Make that black hearse get driven, givin' murder missions
Try your luck, baby, trigger finger, nervous itchin’
Double shots, no rocks, I let it burn the system

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Yo, Kane train murder for hire, bitch, I should buy some ass
Hit a lick with buddy and left em’, I couldn’t divide the cash
My only baby mama D-M'in' me to supply the ass
I leave a bitch on red like she outta’ gas
I leave the bitch on dead like a Duracell
Season up that chicken finger, lickin’ if you cook it well
I just dropped a flocka, 50 blocks and that crew Riverdale
Christmas '99, I got some soda and some fish scale
Mix yayo
Fuck jail, I don’t sit well
Strictly business, I keep a yellow bitch [?] Tizdale
Packers playin' over the dope it’s Saturn like intel
Bitch, your life don’t matter, take that for Data, like Fizdale
From a Knick to a mothafuckin’ brick
Walter White done touch the hood, now these creatures suckin’ dick
Niggas smokin’ on synthetic weed in case you got em’ sick
I’m addicted to this paper, I’m itchin’ to make a flip

[Verse 4: 38 Spesh]
Ay yo
I’m the nigga that they call Spesh
I’m known for takin' over boulevards 'cause I charge less
My prices far fetched
I put my own numbers on trees, like I’m tryin' to find a lost pet
This a bridge you ain’t crossed yet
Gimme a broad address, I get 'em sent to her doorstep
I’m the one that your whore sweat
But your broad got more miles on her pussy than my Corvette
Had beef, some live, some die
Never been shot before, but some try
This how you separate the truth from the lies
Bums with guns from the ones that slung pies
Me? I could care less about your gun size
Niggas done died from shit small as a thumb drive
One robbery we left a victim untied
He sat four years, corpse was sun dried
Spesh!
