[Verse 1: Marco Polovision]
If you're a gangster, nigga, let me see you shoot a cop
Ain't u always braggin bout how yo gun shoot a lot
Bitch nigga, ain't you the one that rule the block?
Talking this and that, bragging 'bout how you move wit Glocks
But You're the same sucker, quick to shoot your brother
Then quick to run and duck from undercovers
Either u You're a pork lover, or a gangster, motherfucker
If you're the second one, bust your gun when they rush us
Illuminati's real, take a look at the dollar bill
New World Order is right around our hills
And I can give a fuck if I wind up gettin killed
Massa gonna be tight when I rebel on this field
Fuck a cop! cock blockin on my dough
Fucking up my flow knowin the CIA's supplying all the dope
Feeding off we down n out, desperate n broke
Then they bring it here in boats n feed it to our folks

[Hook 2x: Marco Polovision]
Fuck a cop! Yo, I hate 'em with a passion
Fuck a cop! From the lieutenant to the captain
Fuck a cop! Yo, we need to get it blasting
They kill us everyday, now it's time for some action!

[Verse 2: Uncle Murda]
When it comes to beef man, call me the beef man
I'm jumping out with the heat from the passenger seat man
Or I still don't know how to drive yet
Sometimes I can think and that's why I ain't die yet
I anybody new my whip, with all the beef I got
I probably would have been got hit
For real homey, that's just how I feel
I prefer my man's hand on the steering wheel
And mines on the steel, police broke my leg before, man
They really fucked me up, now my leg wasn't broke
But I couldn't walk for a month
They got me good that day, I can't front
They really tried to play me, tried to play me like a chump
After they whipped my ass son, they still locked me up
They took me to the hospital, I see the doctor in cuffs
He look at them like man, you really fucked the dude up
Just another reason why I hate the pigs so much

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]
I see one cop, two cop, then out come the oowop
I'm brave as Larry Davis, my mind fucking with a hard times
We trying to see cake for that kid out that we take
We've got plans for the tri-state, to make it a police state
Feed my cans and the hundreds, but I ain't going peacefully
Y'all freeze, I breeze for that desert ease in my stomach
Then I ran out of ammo, I'mma squeeze something from it
Empty semi's from all that PD shit is done with
Run with a cavalry, turning batteries long style
Explain that to the Bilderbergs and the Rothschilds
Since they wrote out Habeas Corpus, 911 get outgunned
In the craziest fortress, thinking diablo and shit
I'mma blaze where your orbs went, Robocop is the movie officer
You all off script, trying to give a nigga up north trips
Y'all porks spit, that forth-fifth will hit your chest like a horse kick

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 4: Turko]
My blow olds put me over for taxes
A 150 find my bills all up in the collections
You fags won't get a dime, it's that motherfucking recession
You want my dinner time? Who the fuck y'all piggies is kidding?
Go fucking get in line! Now they've got my license suspending
Plus my blink is out, I'm cruising with a sip on that hit
I'm lit, I'm hitting sour, same story, different time
Friends be down, like I find a couple of grams
I'm getting out tonight, fuck a snitch in rhyme
Most of them little bitches flowers like a kitchen's towel
Got picked on, punked in school, now they get some power
That shiny badge and that tool, them piggies is cowards
If your house is getting robbed, they won't show up in six hours
Now I heard they're trying to close down Brooklyn House
What's that about? They gonna pack us all up in a toom
Just for a bag now, they just should start out giving tickets
I'd rather that route, and stop wasting them tax dollars
On collars like a cash scout

[Hook 2x]
