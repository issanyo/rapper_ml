[I'm Kool G Rap
Their latest release (x2)
I'm Kool G Rap...and he's Polo]

He's the big boss when his hands criss-cross
Up and down the crossfader turning wax to sauce
It ain't a hip-hop record that he can't chop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

[Get violent (x3)]

The rhythm he brings makes the audience swing
While the plates rotates his fingers cling
To the records on felts, your earwax melts
Scratching so hard that he breaks the belts
DJ's relax, kneecaps collapse
My rap perhaps is like a booby trap
Polo the big boar, I'm the warrior of metaphor
Fully equipped manipulating my competitor
And I remain just like a stain
As long as I maintain my brainiac brain
Rap words rehearsed since first grade
My utensil is the pencil and his is a blade
The man at the top of the needle drop
Polo let's have some fun, show them how it's done
Treat them like your son, in the butcher shop

[Psychopath on the phonograph (x2)]

DJ's he's disputed you should be saluted
The man gives a cut with scratches included
I'm Kool G Rap, he's my DJ
This is a mortal combat of the Polo play
Cuts like a scissor, rips like a razor
The sound penetrates elements like a laser
The beat connects to my dialect
New Technic turntables, the party I wreck
Motivation to blend, the rotation begins
They reported his fins on 1010 West
And his name is Polo the phonograph is for bolo
I go solo, to battle Kool G Rap is no-no, bozo
Your style is so-so, equal to disco
Swing and some go-go, and on to calypso
So biters and reciters, don't mean to offend you
Yes I will continue but I'm not a menu
So don't bite or swallow or fight or follow
Recite or borrow rhymes and want to give them back tomorrow
Polo is like Zorro, war hero
Horror, terror, errors: zero
The alert concert network expert
He'll wreck dissect inject insert
Cuts, til your eardrums pop
Polo show them how it's done in the butcher shop

[Nut of the cuts]

I'm a walking dictionary, an encyclopedia
Rapper with data, the best in the media
Or area, so prepare for your burial
On your radio, pull out your aerial
Or antenna cause this one is a winner
Not a sinner, or an MC beginner
Kool G Rap is just me not he or she or we
Or any other MC
So please, I'm single and not plural
I'm totally high moral, excellent with the oral
Contact, and at the maximum, yo he's climax
DJ Polo attacks the earwax
In the butcher shop
