[Verse 1: 38 Spesh & Kool G Rap]

[38 Spesh]
Yo, hey yo
All these guns I collect is to X you out
I'm overqualified for the next shootout
Caught him broad day, right before they let school out
He got left with the left of his chest blew out

[Kool G Rap]
My real niggas moved out and loosed out wit' two out
Issues out, tool in his mouth, threw his screws out
Caught him a with a couple, put potatoes on the muzzles
Part of his face muscle on the landscape and rubble

[38 Spesh]
That man made a puddle, told his bitch he can't lay or cuddle
Since '96 my hands stayed in trouble
Married to the money, me and them bands made a couple
My ambition met coke and mandated doubled

[Kool G Rap]
My killas move around where fake handshakes'll slug you

[38 Spesh]
Duct tape and a shovel, man they in trouble, how you hustle?

[Kool G Rap]
I'm Captain Kirk with the work, I run the Enterprise
None of my workers been inside cause they women live

[Chorus: 38 Spesh]
Nigga what'chu mean? (Nigga what'chu mean?)
I was raised by the pimps, the OGs, and fiends
We don't fuck wit' your team (we don't fuck wit' you niggas)
Got a clique full of killas from Upstate to Queens
Niggas bloody up the scene (hit 'em up, hit 'em up)
When they come through your block with them 50 shot machines
You don't want what I bring (you don't want what I bring)
Keep a cup full of liquor, I don't fuck with the Lean, nigga

[Verse 2: 38 Spesh & Kool G Rap]

[Kool G Rap]
We that real bad decision, catch a permanent incision
Cartier's for the vision, nigga money the religion
Shirley Temple curl, killas stirring in the kitchen
That westside connect, baby, outta town, I twist 'em

[38 Spesh]
Got a lot of guys in prison, who momma cried in visits
And they tryna' find prescriptions for they homicide addiction
You tryna' find a misses, I'm tryna' find them riches
So I started pimpin', learnt how to monetize my bitches

[Kool G Rap]
'Kid, that drama's highly vicious; you gon' see it when that shotty pop (huh)
And take pieces off your frame like the body shop

[38 Spesh]
I'm inside of his bitch mouth like a lollipop
Crack got me hot so I opened up the Molly spot

[Kool G Rap]
You get done dirty here, kid this a Gotti block
Treacherous three on the squeeze, I make your body rock

[38 Spesh]
A-yo, G, how many slugs do the shotty got?

[Kool G Rap]
I put at least twelve shells inside of papi top

[Chorus: 38 Spesh]
Nigga what'chu mean? (Nigga what'chu mean?)
I was raised by the pimps, the OGs, and fiends
We don't fuck wit' your team (we don't fuck wit' you niggas)
Got a clique full of niggas from Upstate to Queens
Niggas bloody up the scene (hit 'em up, hit 'em up)
When they come through your block with them 50 shot machines
You don't want what I bring (you don't want what I bring)
Keep a cup full of liquor, I don't fuck with the Lean, nigga
