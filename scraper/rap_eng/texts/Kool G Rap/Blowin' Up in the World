[Verse 1]
Back in the days was kinda crazy, kid I started out with nothin'
Wasn't livin' like Thanksgiving, I was turkey without the stuffin'
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the poorhouse
Say mama caught the drama, she would bleed tryin to feed 4 mouths
Wasn't rockin' Girbauds, I barely had clothes, and when it snowed
And temperatures droppin' below zero, you know I froze
No CD's, a black and white TV
Your seat is up under a tire
With a hanger for the antenna
Turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin' in my cabinet, but cans of Raid
I'm knockin' on my neighbor's door
To borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid
I wasn't freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped
I'm trippin' cause my winter coat got lost buttons
And zippers that wouldn't stay zipped
I never remembered a dinner and the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black, I had kit-kats on top of crackerjacks
Walkin' the streets, with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldn't speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin' humped from the stunts, I always struck out
The one you like says take a hike if you canâ€™t pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world

[Hook]
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, youknowhatI'msayin? I'm blowin' up in the world

Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world
Blowin' up, blowin' up in the world!
I'm blowin' up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, yeah...

[Verse 2]
It seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back
"Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road Jack"
Black, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona
With a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin' than Tony Roma's
In order to get straight, I gots ta to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin' down on the corner slangin' fat rocks to bottles
With the black tops, for cops got my shorty watchin' my back Hobbes
Makin' mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton & gucci
Hoochies callin' me boochi, while they smooch me, givin' up the coochie
Now I'm a felon, started sellin' and splittin' melons
Some started jellin' and tellin' police just cause I was swellin'
Hangin' out on the corner playin' cee-lo, rollin' for half a kilo
Yo you'll never see G-low or-goin below
Yeah, straight gettin' fortunate,  as long as fiends was torchin' it
It started gettin' hot around the block, the cops was scorchin' it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
This business in drugs is gettin' too risky
So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch tramps diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin' up in the world

[Verse 3]
I got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, "It's a Demo"
And started chill in the limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin', no time for pagers, sportin' gold chains and rings
Clockin' money and fame, nothin' changed, I'm still the same
Just spendin' 20's and 10's at women pullin' on my linen
Then grinnin' cause I was winnin' in this game from the beginning
The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills
I turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos
Though my dough used to be low, now I puff on cigars and blow O's
So catch a flashback, of a G. Rap track, attacked, like a head crack
Get smacked, through your cap, with the lead black
And here's a new cut for pooh-butt rappers hangin' from off my two nuts
Like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G. Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's witcha girl
Straight up kid, I'm blowin' up in the world
