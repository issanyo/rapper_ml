[ Chorus ]
I don't give a fuck what y'all haters do, I'ma get thug money
Hustler now, there with my crew, ain't nothin like thug money
First of the month, fiends' checks is due, gotta get thug money
Hustler now, there with my crew, ain't nothin like thug money

[ VERSE 1: Yukmouth ]
Thug niggas drink bottles of XO and Christie
Fuck whiskey long as chicks be givin me headshots like Lewinsky
My click be extra tipsy, thuggin in a 4.6 v
Three TV's, DVD's and PlayStation, who's fuckin with me?
Personally, you gotta be gold, platinum, pimpin or either hustlin ki's
To even be puffin my weed
Fuckin with me is gettin hauled, tied, stuffed in a tree
With dynamite stuck to your feet
It's rough in the street, muthafuckas get touched in the street
I got these faggot rappers clutchin they heat
Cause ain't no discussin a beef
Actions speaks louder than words
Recipes for niggas secret ????
Niggas get served with the Mossberg
'Sawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump'
Leavin muthafuckas slump
Niggas get dumped like blunt ashes
I got these faggots takin thug classes
Smokin hash and gettin they ass tatted
Got the padded calabasses ????
My niggas came a long way from bein on section 8
While featherweights hesitate my money escalate
Make moves in every state, got 20's on the Escalade
I smoke everyday, drink Louis XIII
More platinum teeth than platinum jewerly, enough to hurt me
???? Iceberg ????, rock brim hats and Moschino
I'm like Nino plus shoot craps and hit Casinos
10 g's in chips tryin to break shit up
My necklace stay lit up, my Rolex stay chipped up
My vehicle's rimmed up, drink Christie till I'm pissy drunk with hicups
I used to dump on niggas, hit stick-up's
So many bricks got cooked up, ghetto pusher fuckin ghetto sisters
Now I eats models out their pedal pushers
For my thug niggas hustlin crack
Yukmouth, Kool G Rap - what's fuckin with that?
Holler back, bitch

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
A paid thug nigga known to lay rugs, bust a 8 snub
Crushed grape bub, pop a $200 plate grub
Gorilla family booty shake clubs
Nothing but ape love, I got yours and take it in blood
Nigga, you got mines to take it in slugs
Rearrange the shape of your mug
Hit you with a shake and a hug
Then lay you down for a cake of the drugs
Dirty money, cover the paper with mud
Dig in your pigeon while we caper the scrub
Nigga, you nothin but a snake in a bud
G Rap and Yukmouth'll get you tossed out and struck out
Nigga, you lucked out, we plushed out
???? out, got niggas trippin like a bus route
Holdin hammers but not ready to bust out
Get tossed out steppin to these, weaponry like Vietnamese
Sweatin the gees, get wet in the knees
Left in the trees east and the west, we rep a breeze
Till the death we keep it stress-free
But very daily hold the heavy shit inside of Chevy's
Plannnin your death over spaghetti
We target-ready, turn your mind in confetti
Flippin the most, fully-loaded clip in the toast
Pour a tall glass of Cris and we toast
Couple of hollers, grip and rip on a coast
Couple of chickens with our dick in they throats
Bitches strippin on boats, niggas trickin they notes
All the chips that we gross, millionaire status
Mafia marriage, nigga that's out for carats like rabbits
Stuff the wall safe with stacks of cabbage
Put a gat in back of your cabbage
You livin lavish, nigga, give up the package
Got a clique of niggas livin savage
Troubled kids and bastards
Out of your average, ???? danger and hazards
Young gun niggas that strap the ratchet
Lay you back inside of a casket
Put you in plastic, stretch you like elastic
When the Mac hit it burn like acid
You do Hail Mary's like you was Catholic
Need a priest, nigga, to chat with

[ Chorus ]
