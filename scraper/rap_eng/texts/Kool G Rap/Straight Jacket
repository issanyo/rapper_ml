"Ghetto Style"
"Talk that shit"

[Verse 1]
Help me doctor doctor cause I'm seein lots of spots
I'm thinkin' of pink elephants with little polka dots
I'm tired, crazy tired, but I cannot get no sleep
Cause every time I close my eyes I think I'm six feet deep
I feel I'm goin' slow as hell, but everything is speedin'
Last night I woke up screamin' and my bathroom walls were bleedin'
I thought I fell asleep at work, but then when I awoke
I was all alone and had my own hands on my throat
Clippings from the newspaper of murders; my library
Sometimes I get a urge to walk inside a cemetery
I looked into a mirror, seen a rope around my neck
I smoke a lot of cigarettes, cause I'm a nervous wreck
Tryin' to relax, I ran some water in the tub
Vision somebody slaughtered, then the water turned to blood
I'm runnin' down the hallway tryna reach an exit door
The more and more I run, seems like it's further than before
Voices sometimes tell me what I won't do, what I will do
Voices in my head right now are tellin' me to kill you
Filled up with anxiety, I went to Lover's Lane
Seen a couple kiss and then blew out the brother's brain
I feel the world's against me and the women are so dirty
I hate women today because my mother used to hurt me
I think I'm goin' crazy, doc, no longer can I hack it
Please, doctor please, put me in a straight jacket

[Verse 2]
A lady picked me up hitchikin', what a big mistake
Several hours later, there's a body by the lake
Walked into a train station, headed towards the back
Caught a flashback, and pushed a man right on the track
I'm in my darkroom inside my house; that is deserted
Developin' the photo of a ho that I just murdered
I took a walk one night because I wanted to get out
I stepped outside, I paused, and I was back inside my house
Called up plenty doctors; told 'em all about my health
My phone just plays a dial tone; I'm talkin' to myself
Snap back to reality, at least that's what I thought
Runnin' from the spirits of the bodies I just caught
I can't escape this hell I'm in, not even in my dreams
I cover both my ears, because I'm sick of hearin' screams
I've been a mental case since I was in the seventh grade
Stabbed another student, licked his blood off of my blade
I got two personalities inside, sometimes they battle
When I look at my picture, all I see is scribble scrabble
I feel I'm really losin' it, I need to write to Abby
The characters on TV try to reach right out and grab me
I always hear somebody talkin' bout they gonna do me
But I listen again and it's those voices talkin' to me
You heard of shadowboxin'? I see mine and then attack it
Please, doctor please, put me in a straight jacket
