[Verse 1: Kool G. Rap]
It’s that dark rebel at chart levels
All lames get bent off the frame like daredevil car metal
March with fellows in the hardest ghetto
Kids in the kitchen, but large kettles
And they ain't cooking marshmallows
Something more like a hard yellow
Young face to supply base like mozart jellos
So step on this shit like go kart pedals
Right here you’re getting rizzy
Fried and cooked to the fish scale
Crispy like Arthur Treachers
Ain’t it hard to heat ya imposter with heaters
And your future type of car be the reaper
Double action like a double feature
Being a young eager beaver made em puff the reefer
Now grown up, he loves the divas
Bustin' in they cleavage, chuck snub heaters that blow like a club speaker
Hit dames in the head like caveman clubs beater
He be the king size, KGR franchise
Ice cold, see no soul in the man’s eyes
And my main goal is to roll in that land ride
I spit quills to make a killing when my grams dry

[Verse 2: Logic Ali]
You see a killer in this man’s eyes
I’m killing and I’m burning like a camp fire
He said that I ain’t trapping, that’s a damn lie
I hand-to-hand pies like a grandma
But no, I ain’t a granny, I just ate Xanax
Took down eight Xanax like straight candy
I got a lot of tools but I ain’t handy
I’m a motherfucker savage, but I ain’t Randy
But I still get these bows off
Kool G and Logic like Beethoven, Mozart
Like show parts and Breitling
Zangief and M. Bison, but we nicer
Word slicer, toss 'em up like volleyball
I'm flyer than an albatross on Al B Sure
And I'll be sure to make you think that Logic Ali raw
I'll probably body ya'll, mashed up like Mardi Gras
Dropping off your body parts so your mommy’s saw
You gone probably have to get your bodyguard a bodyguard
