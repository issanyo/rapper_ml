[Hook - RZA]
Join the operator
This is hot potato
Maybe drop it now
Or try to drop it later
The innoculator - pop Glock
Will stop a hater
Shell-shock a cop
My Glock is dark as Vader

[Kosha Dillz]
Twisted bottle cap
Yamulke, Harmonica salute
Goon, Vidal Sassoon, boom
I ain't gotta rap
Polish off the Molotov cocktail
Felafel rocket launch weapon
Hold, plead the 5th
Cocaine in the pita pit
No name need to spit
Making sure Kosha Dillz really it
One man fight, might pop a wheelie kid
Just another guy, pray that my mother lie
Heavenly the day I day I better be
Walk the hinges from the feet up off the inches
9 milimeter off seal, I mean business
I mean business, see me for
Cock pistol, reload, shoot
Street money, CPR
Teach you scars, double down
3 new cards, no parole, max out
Killa, I eat through bars
New Jersey journey pot
Wild Turkey Hershey spot
Watch out, til the block house
Nut house get shot out
Shout out a shout out to
Cop house, I got out
Back to the grill again
And a grill get knocked out
Fortified with vitamins from Israel
To fight your lands, Kosha Dillz
In fighting stance, killa man
With mic in hand

[Kool G. Rap]
Gotta be hood to love it
All throughout the suburbs
Get heard like it's rubbish
Get blood spilled, sidewalks
With drugs and some slugs lit
Blocks where the Bloods is
Some niggas on some Cuz shit
Gutter biz, that's that beef smell
In the alleyway
Murder rate, yellow tape
Another way the ? is played
With a stomach growl in place
Can't make the hunger stop
Same ? hungry block
It's that white game, dice game
And I'mma spot shorties
Between the brides, already
Youngest exec to run a block
This is where they dump a shot body
In that dumpster
Hood life, this that scene where
The fiends live the hooked life
Hard white, cooked right
They searching for that good price
This that scene where
The fiends live the hooked life
Hard white, cooked right
They searching for that good price
