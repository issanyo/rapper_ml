[Hook x2]
Every word I spit be real talk
Every time I get at your bitch it's real talk, you heard, nigga
Chicks be losing it, thick bricks, we moving it
Straight up and down, y'all niggas knowing how we doing it

[Verse 1]
I'm a real nigga, no gimmicks, no mimmicks in the image
No blemish in the rocks, no linage
Dope sprinters on the block, low chemist
You get my scrimmage on the block, no spinage
You get popped, shot [?] on the top, [?]
Dropped to an ambulance, cop with low manners
Nigga that roll spinach in the box so finished
Spray y'all way with AR's and AK's
Have niggas yelling out ''make days or make way''
Keep the fucking heat on my back like Jamai-cai
Funny style ass sweet nigga, you been gay
You clack from the rear, you acting in fear
Your whole crew shoot, nigga, that's why I clap at your peers
When I ain't talking food I'm talking apples and beers
[?] make your adam's apple appear
Make no mistake about it, Big Apple in here, you hear?

[Hook]
