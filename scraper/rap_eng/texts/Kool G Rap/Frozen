[Chorus: Nas Samples]
Leave your brain stimulated niggas is frozen
Feeling like Braille

[Verse 1: Journalist]
From the time you stick the disc in
It's the same felling as a heroin addict gets when he stick the syringe in
I put you in the deep nod
Back and forth constant
Once I get in your system there's no way you can stop it
I got what you need man
My product is classic
I make you spend your last for that work in the plastic
There's nothing like it when you get your hit for the first time
So, take advantage son, it comes once in a life time
Pure dope is rare in my neck of the woods
So we download streams and pray that it's good
We take a chance with a virus to get to that raw cut
Malware, Trojan, trust me they all suck
So, when it comes to mind son, I'm something like Frank Luc
Spitting blue magic when I step in that sound booth
So if you need a hit
I'm the one you should come see
Froze like heroin in your nose from the sixteen

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
We the cold blooded
[?]
Spot a bitch with potential, she like the diamond in the rubble
Steps off, make a best seller like L. Ron Hubbard's
Heavily burden the bitch, like heavy luggage
When I say strip, they gladly strip
Get a grip bitch
Let's grab these chips
Caddy with daddy's rich [?]
Daddy's bitch
Pot of gold, honour roll [?]
Spot the road, let's go
Spot is global
Harry Potter stone
Yeah, we out of 'tron
Two numbers followed by several o's
A lot of dough
Let's get this cheddar pocketed
I'll tell you better when your head is dropping
Not H-O, I'm that cake, yo
Like that [?]
[?]
Pie rose from a payload
Move when I say so
I'm in the driver seat and I don't give a fuck if you're in the eighth row
