How your heart pump kool-aid when is brood and mice
How you trying to fight slugs with knives (don't do that) bitch nigga

Drama, is the life I live
Bossing, is the things I did
Problems, is the things I finish
I been known from hood to hood to handle business
Money, is them things I take
Ladies, come on and bounce with me
G Rap, I damn from far from fake
Throw your steel in the air if you' bout your cake

[Kool G Rap]
Ayo my whole life is under non-fiction
Drama friction
Beef blood in the street bullets with bombs ticking
Just to become a don from sinning
Horrible living G Cana the street boss peoples loss
Left a dog reap in the cost
Had to go deep in the forest
To hold police frost peeping the floss
Conduct family biz have my own Sammidy Sam kids
And pump fizz were you live (o-ow)
Run up in a house and put a hand on a wiz
Give me fifty grand to live (Bitch)
G Rap Americas Most see the name embedded in toast
I'm here to all y'all niggas perish and quote
We lost money but cherish the dope
Meat cleavers sever your throat
The smoke, for the big bread and the a boat
So all you guys with gimmicks (die, die, die)
Skies the limit better believe it
That I'm gonna ride every minute
And this games about posh and spinach
And the lifer this shit get the love for menace
Never violate the lines of scrimmage
G Rap Giancana kid I'm vow to keep it life to the
Finish (uh-hu) yeah

[Hook]
Drama, is the life I live
Bossing, is the things I did
