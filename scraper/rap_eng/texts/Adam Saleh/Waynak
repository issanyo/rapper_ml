[Faydee:]
Where did you go
I need to find you like treasure, treasure
Trust me I know
Love in Dubai’s just better, better

So many ways to love you
I’m on my way to love you
So much to crave about you
Can’t spend a day without you, nah
The things I do tryna get hold of you
Now make a move I’ve been patient for you

So please don’t keep me waiting
‘Cause tomorrow never comes
All this hesitating
Took the air right out my lungs

Waynak, Waynak
Ta'alla Ya Habibi
Daimn Ala Bali
Waynak, Waynak
Ta'alla Ya Habibi
Daimn Ala Bali

[Adam:]
I still work the late shift
Still so far from greatness
Still got time for good girls
Still violate a fake chick
Just got home from Lebanon
My passport got so full
I had to get another one
Spent half of my life on a runway
EJ’s on a PJ
Head not towards the DJ
Got Faydee on replay
Stack paper like a briefcase
Ima make you face your fear of heights today
Or you gonna worry worry worry your whole life away

[Faydee:]
So please don’t keep me waiting
Cause tomorrow never comes
All this hesitating
Took the air right out my lungs

Waynak, Waynak
Ta'alla Ya Habibi
Daimn Ala Bali
Waynak, Waynak
Ta'alla Ya Habibi
Daimn Ala Bali

[Adam:]
Chilling in it shakes
Swear to God it should have came
When life gives you Yemen
Baby make some Yemenade
Name a place I’ll meet you there
I’ll treat the plane like a Uber
If that makes me a Majnoon
It’s cause anti Majnoona

[Faydee:]
Bade ashofek behnar o blel
Mahma bhawel ma bade ansaki
Bramt aioon alnas lalaeke
Ya Habibi

Waynak, Waynak
Ta'alla Ya Habibi
Daimn Ala Bali
Waynak, Waynak
Ta'alla Ya Habibi
Daimn Ala Bali
