Where you been, where you been
I've been waiting here the whole time for you
I've been waiting here a long time for you
You been missin
Better said, Better said
I've been patient like a waiting room for you
I've been waiting in a long line for you
Still missin
I was hoping you would write back
Hit me and I hit you right back
Imma put us on the right track
I said baby Imma put us on the right track
Tell me when you wanna roll through
I remember when I told you
I don't wanna control you, I just wanna hold you

If you don't do write no more, let him go
If you can't get it right girl just say so
If I'm steppin too far then let me know
Let me know girl, let me know, let me know

If you're lonely, baby just call me
Cause I'm waiting to love you once again
If you're lonely, baby just call me
You need to let me take care of you
We both know that you want me too

Now that I've given you, all you can handle
You know that I'd give you all you can handle
Once we get going, there's a problem
All you can handle

Push up on me
Push it, push
Yeah, yeah, I like it
Baby you know I like that
You should let me like that
Push up on me right, push up on me

Let me in, let me in
I've been waiting in the rain all night
I don't wanna explain all night
You never listen, you never do
How bout this, How bout this
You were with your friend all night
You don't have to pretend all night
I saw you kissing
I was hoping you would write back
Hit me and I hit you right back
Imma put us on the right track
I said baby Imma put us on the right track
Tell me when you wanna roll through
I remember when I told you
I don't wanna control you, I just wanna hold you

If you don't do write no more, let him go
If you can't get it right girl just say so
If I'm steppin too far then let me know
Let me know girl, let me know, let me know

If you're lonely, baby just call me
Cause I'm waiting to love you once again
If you're lonely, baby just call me
You need to let me take care of you
We both know that you want me too

Now that I've given you all you can handle
You know that I'd give you all you can handle
Once we get going, there's a problem
All you can handle

Push up on me
Push it, push

Baby you know I like that
You should let me like that
Push up on me right, push up on me
