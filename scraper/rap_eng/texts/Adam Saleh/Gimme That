Intro: Zack Knight
Say what you want about me
Why you all tryna hate my money I make
Cause you don't know shit about me
We don't Netflix and Chill
We only count down the bills

Hook: Adam Saleh

So gimme that

Body: Adam Saleh
I swear I never held one grudge (no)
I swear I never left one club (I'm upset)
Cause if a dude wants something to prove
Lowkey mad because his girl want some
See my bad loaf many you envious, ayy
Peanut butter jelly man that's obvious, ayy
You ain't even know it
You ain't even know it
Same color as your face where my money is
Same phone who dis? (who dat)
New whip, New home
Late minds think alike
Great minds think alone

Zack Knight:

Say what you want about me
Why you all tryna hate my money I make
Cause you don't know shit about me
We don't Netflix and Chill
We only count down the bills

Hook: Adam Saleh

So gimme that

Man I worked so hard I think my heart just turned cold
Now I wake up and do what I want
You just do what you told to, ayy
They told me to but I ain't listen, ayy
I ain't got time to pay attention, ayy
You let the hate blind you, (I got a vision), ayy
James told me to think it into existence, ayyyyyy
Same phone who dis? (who dat)
New whip, New home
Late minds think alike
Great minds think alone

Zack Knight:

Say what you want about me
Why you all tryna hate my money I make
Cause you don't know shit about me
We don't Netflix and Chill
We only count down the bills

Adam Saleh:
So gimme that
