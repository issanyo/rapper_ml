We are the world
We shouldn´t take the little things for granted
We are the people
We can't forget our brothers and sisters in need
We are the reason
Why we shouldn´t ever complain
They keep a happy face with a little that they have
Tomorrow´s another day
Yeah
Tomorrow´s another day
Yeah... yeah... yeah
They say poverty´s like love
Make me loose sleep
When it´s all that i think of
We treat this world like a kingdom
Kids out there when the war
Then to live from
Mothers struggling to give their kids the basic of live
And when we cry we criticize how they survive
And every morning we waken up
With a dream and our eyes
We need to put our problems to the side
What does it takes to be human?
What does it take to love?
How can we change this world?
We gotta rise up
We are the world
We shouldn´t take the little things for granted
We are the people
We can't forget our brothers and sisters in need
We are the reason
Why we shouldn´t ever complain
They keep a happy face with little they have
Tomorrow´s another day
This word has a new sickness
People assessed with riches
Shiney rings and a rich list
While i got my own wish list
I just need to pray on a page
And change things to fix it
I´m tired of babies crying
Seeing people dying
Imma trying to find the strengh
I need to help people survive i´m trying to be all i could be
So here is some piece of mind
So all we need to do is
Follow me and we can fly
What does it takes to be human?
What does it take to love?
How can we change this world?
We gotta rise up
We are the world
We shouldn´t take the little things for granted
We are the people
We can't forget our brothers and sisters in need
We are the reason
Why we shouldn´t ever complain
They keep a happy face with a little that they have
Tomorrow´s another day
Tomorrow´s another day
We are the world
We shouldn´t take the little things for granted
We are the people
We can't forget our brothers and sisters in need
We are the reason
Why we shouldn´t ever complain
They keep a happy face with a little that they have
Tomorrow´s another day
Tomorrow´s another day
