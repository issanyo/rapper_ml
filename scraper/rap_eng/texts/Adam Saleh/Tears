[Zack]
Those tears, let me wipe them away
I know you'll be okay, that's what you used to say
And now you're in heaven, keeping me safe
This feels like hell, now that you're not here with me

[Adam]
She told me daddy was a best friend
Devastated she don't know how it could just end
Daddy how could you leave me like this it's not fair
Cuz now it's just me and mama at home and I'm scared
Everyday she's reminiscing on the time spent
And she can't even comprehend where the time went
But now it's me and her and I swear, that I'll be there
That imma take the pain away
I'm right, I'm right here

[Zack]
Those tears, let me wipe them away

[Adam]
(Wipe them away, wipe them away)

[Zack]
I know you'll be okay, that's what you used to say

[Adam]
(Be okay be okay)

[Zack]
I know heaven is keeping me safe

[Adam]
(I'm here for you, here for you)

[Zack]
This feels like hell, now that you're not here with me

[Adam]
(I'm right here, I'm right here)

[Zack]
Now that you're not here with me

[Adam]
The day her dad crashed I could tell by her reaction
He was driving too fast in the fast lane when it happened
Now I try to imagine and help her through the sadness
And tell her it's gonna be alright
So baby please be who you wanna be
I know your father would be proud of who you're gonna be
So don't let anybody tell you what you're gonna be
Oh baby you can have anything you want from me
(anything you want from me)
I can't replace him, but baby I'll try

[Zack]
(for me to be the man that he would be proud of)

[Adam]
Everyday for the rest of my life

[Zack]
(Promise to be the one that I can count on)

[Adam]
I can't replace him, but baby I'll try

[Zack]
(Don't wanna cry no more, but these tears won't go away)

[Adam]
Everyday for the rest of my life

[Zack]

[Adam]
So baby please be who you wanna be
I know your father would be proud of who you're gonna be
So don't let anybody tell you what you're gonna be

[Zack]

[Adam]
Oh baby you can have anything you want from me
