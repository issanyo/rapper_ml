[Verse 1]
This the moment that I've been waiting for
Girl what took so long, for you to hit my phone
So I guess you know its better than never
Cause ever since you did, girl I've been feeling a lot better, lot better yea
Girl all of my intentions are good, giving you the love nobody else could
But I'm on my way, didn't mean to make you wait
Traffic got me running a little late, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I know you've been waiting for me to come through
Long overdue, overdue I can't get over you
Constantly thinking, on my way to you
What we could do two on two
Hit my line I'm on my way like a tsunami

[Chorus]
I'm on my way like tsunami (3X)

[Verse 2]
Girl I know that you been patiently waiting
But I've been just on the road, thought I just let you know
So when you hear me pulling up outside
Just know I've been ready for you, girl I can't lie
Can't wait to put you on tonight
Cause that how I feel, girl and on the real we'll be doing the most tonight
Just you and I girl, I provide, put all my needs aside
For a one on one session, and you already know I'm on a mission

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I know you've been waiting for me to come through
Long overdue, overdue I can't get over you
Constantly thinking, on my way to you
What we could do two on two
Hit my line I'm on my way like a tsunami

[Chorus]
I'm on my way like a tsunami (3X)

*Bridge*

[Chorus]
You hit my line
I'm on my way like a tsunami (3X)
