[Intro: Mumzy Stranger]
She is a diamond x3

[Chorus: Mumzy Stranger]
She is a diamond, she doesn't even know
That this guy is playing her with all his dollars
The quicker you open your eyes girl
And you will know, I will give you everything
I will give you what you need

[Verse 1: Adam Saleh]
Yeah, he got diamonds and pearls
Money on his mind no love for you girl
Come, any time of the day
I could be your best friend always here to stay
Yeah, doesn't matter what you say
Cause you're stuck in the middle, but I could get you out the game
Uh, he's yapping and chatting and yapping and yapping
And leaving her all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Sheikh Akbar]
Yeah, and I be balling
Take my money and you be calling
All your girls tonight
Go buy some Louis Vuitton
Put your make-up on
Put your dresses on
Put your stillos (stilettos) on
Just turn it on
When I call for you, look pretty for me
What you're looking at here is all you need

[Chorus: Mumzy Stranger]
She is a diamond, she doesn't even know
That this guy is playing her with all his dollars
The quicker you open your eyes girl
And you will know, I will give you everything
I will give you what you need

[Drop: Mumzy Stranger]
She is a diamond, she is a diamond girl
She is a diamond. Diamond, diamond, diamond girl

[Verse 2: Adam Saleh]
Yo, he's playing tricks with your mind
Don't be so blind
You need to rewind
You could do better, forever and ever
I will always keep it together
So let me just explain
I'm not about the dollar
I will take away your pain
I know it's hard for you to leave this money and fame
Not on the rich list, I know that you would change

[Pre-Chorus: Sheikh Akbar]
Yeah, and I be balling
Take my money and you be calling
All your girls tonight
Go buy some Louis Vuitton
Put your make-up on
Put your dresses on
Put your stillos (stilettos) on
Just turn it on
When I call for you, look pretty for me
What you're looking at here is all you need

[Chorus: Mumzy Stranger]
She is a diamond, she doesn't even know
That this guy is playing her with all his dollars
The quicker you open your eyes girl
And you will know, I will give you everything
I will give you what you need

[Bridge: Adam Saleh and Sheikh Akbar]
It's a shame that I didn't see
I had to take what you couldn't see
I gave dollars, but never me
And now it's us just let it be
