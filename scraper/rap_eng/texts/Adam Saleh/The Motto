All my life I've been searching for someone like you baby
All this time I been wondering when I find my lady
So many thoughts run through my mind late at night
That's the time that I lose my patience come to realization that I
That this money comes first and these ladies come second
That this money comes first and this love comes second
That this money comes first and these girls come second
That's the motherf*ckin motto baby
That this money comes first and these ladies come second
That this money comes first and this love comes second
That this money comes first and these girls come second
That's the motherf*ckin motto baby

Why you mad, why you mad I
'm smilingLow-key walling
Just woke up and made a video
Bout to take a flight out the city though
I just landed this morning
Leave in four hours
Sleeping and shower
She said time flies when you're having fun
It's like I fit a week in an hour
We out here, we out here
She  look nice, I look twice
So thick but her hips don't lie
Now that would make a good wife
There you go creating problems
I know what it takes to solve it
I used to do the Harlem shake
Now I'm the shake of Harlem

All my life I've been searching for someone like you baby
All this time I been wondering when I find my lady
So many thoughts run through my mind late at night
That's the time that I lose my patience come to realization that I
That this money comes first and these ladies come second
That this money comes first and this love comes second
That this money comes first and these girls come second
That's the motherf*ckin motto baby
That this money comes first and these ladies come second
That this money comes first and this love comes second
That this money comes first and these girls come second
That's the motherf*ckin motto baby

All I do is work, the love comes first and the money comes second
The stage getting marked
The show goes first and the money comes second
I know how to get by
I know how to stay fly
I know how to make funds
My circle is so small
Cause I got a good eye for spottin the fake ones
Me and Slim done made it out the hood but we still some hoodlums
Smile's all around
Somebody act up
We gon take it back to Brooklyn
There you go creating problems
I know what it takes to solve it
I used to do the Harlem shake
Now I'm the shake of Harlem

All my life I've been searching for someone like you baby
All this time I been wondering when I find my lady
So many thoughts run through my mind late at night
That's the time that i lose my patience come to realization that I
That this money comes first and these ladies come second
That this money comes first and this love comes second
That this money comes first and these girls come second
That's the motherf*ckin motto baby
That this money comes first and these ladies come second
That this money comes first and this love comes second
That this money comes first and these girls come second
That's the motherf*ckin motto baby
