Yooo ADAM , Heey Silento
[SILENTO - VERSE]
Rolling in your city pulling up
Lets see how many girlies
I can fit off in my truck
Let me see how many badies
I can put up on this boat
Man you keep it at my concert
That is not a joke
Only in this city yeah they notice us
At the hotel where we posted up
Pretty young thang you can roll with us
Do a couple things that we won't discuss
Said she wanna ball
We can hit the mall
We can do it in a wheel
Ima make a call , call
[FAYDEE - VERSE ]
Oh yeah Oh yeah
When she walks by everybody stares
Oh yeah Oh yeah
She looking like a treat
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Oh yeah Oh yeah
I just wanna be in some peace I swear
How did love just be so sweet so sweet right there
Dance with me all night
Dance in the moonlight yeah
Work the hands till sunrise
And when just when it feels right , just when it feels right
Dance with me all night
Dance in the moonlight yeah
Dance till sunrise
And when the night ends I'll be right there
[ADAM - VERSE ]
I didn't get a chance to write
Back I hope you understand
But I'm about to hit your city
And it really was a plan
We can hit the ocean
Playing with the sand
But for now I'm in the air
Ima hit you when I land
She lives in dubai but she is burning
So you know I put that work in
Liking my pics I see you lurking
One of the realest no other virgin
She is liking my smile
Give me those numbers too girl
And we can chill for a while
Cause it can go down
[SILENTO - VERSE ]
Said she wanna ball
We can hit the mall
We can do it in a wheel
Ima make a call , call

Oh yeah Oh yeah
When she walks by everybody stares
Oh yeah Oh yeah
She looking like a treat
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Oh yeah Oh yeah
I just wanna be in some peace I swear
How did love just be so sweet so sweet right there
Dance with me all night
Dance in the moonlight yeah
Work the hands till sunrise
And when just when it feels right , just when it feels right
Dance with me all night
Dance in the moonlight yeah
Dance till sunrise
And when the night ends I'll be right there
[SILENTO - VERSE ]
