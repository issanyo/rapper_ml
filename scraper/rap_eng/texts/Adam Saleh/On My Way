[Intro]
Ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I’ll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I’ll be on my way

[Verse 1: Faydee]
It’s back and forth everyday
Every little thing go down in place
It’s written all over your face
Thinking that you really gon get your way
And are you gonna let this go
It’s probably gonna drag by to the morning
The way you gonna let this go
The rain won’t stop and now it’s pouring
Bolbol

[Pre-Chorus: Faydee]
No more love, no more games
No more thinking I’m the one to blame
No more tears, no more pain
You can have that I’ll be on my way

Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I’ll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I’ll be on my way

[Chorus]
You can have that I'll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I'll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I'll be on my way

[Verse 2: Faydee]
I ain’t coming back this time
I crossed my heart and I hope to die
I shouldn’t be thinking twice
Even if you say you can love me right
Don’t look at me like that
You’re not gonna change and that’s a fact
Don’t tell me it’s not that bad
I’m out and I won’t be coming back

[Pre-Chorus: Faydee]
No more love, no more games
No more thinking I’m the one to blame
No more tears, no more pain
You can have that I’ll be on my way

Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I’ll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I’ll be on my way

[Chorus]
You can have that I'll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I'll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I'll be on my way

[Bridge: Faydee]
All my life I found a way
Another reason to make you stay
But there’s only so much that I can take
Before we make a change and go our separate ways

[Verse 3: Adam Saleh]
Oh, Ey, fighting all day
Yelling all night
Hear it in the hall way
She said: “You'll be la-a-aughing till you cry”
Yeah that’s what they all say
I’m about to go missing
Thinking how the f***
I got myself in this position
Always got an attitude
Never showing gratitude
Always wanna talk, but she never wanna listen
Oh, Ey, Imma do it my way
Gonna scoop James
Then hit the highway
Now I’m lookin' for somebody
I can call my bae
I just hit my new thing
Said I’m on my way

[Interlude: Faydee]
(Sing it)

On my, on my way
On my
On my, on my way
(On my)

On my, on my way
On my
On my, on my way
(Yippie ya yay)

On my, on my way
On my
On my, on my way

On my, on my way
On my
On my, on my way
(You can have that I’ll be on my way)

[Chorus]
You can have that I'll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I'll be on my way
Say, ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I'll be on my way

[Outro: Faydee]
Say ho, hey, Yippie ya yay
You can have that I’ll be on my way
