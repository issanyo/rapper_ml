[Chorus]
What you really, really want from me?
Hatin' niggas oughta run from me
Why they always tryna come for me?
Swear they wanna feel the drumma drumma drummin
What these bitches really want from me?
We been here spendin' lunch money
Gon head, drop it down for me
And I'ma drum it, drum it, drum it, drum it
Streets on lock
Keys on drop
I share that piece of pie
But please don't drop (Run)
Streets so cold
N!gga might need my coat
Walk in like fee fi foe
I don't even see my folks

[Verse 1]
Oh, what you lookin' at me for?
Blowin' on this C4
Bust a swisher like a freak hoe
Just leveled up with my cheat code
Ball hard on my leash
Dog niggas off leashes
Champagne gotta leave
Just tell me jump and I'll leap it
It's karaoke, lip synchin'
After that she Listerinin'
They just gave me a check tonight
I can handle any misdemeanor
Knock, knock, fuck your subpoena
Pourin' up, no Cold Medina
Cold niggas, flow fever
Turn a 911 to a 4 seater

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll hold it down for my niggas
Give 'em a pound and we twistin'
Snakes in the grass, hear 'em hissin'
They livin' lies and I'm a livin' legend

[Chorus]
What you really, really want from me?
Hatin' niggas oughta run from me
Why they always tryna come for me?
Swear they wanna feel the drumma drumma drummin
What these bitches really want from me?
We been here spendin' lunch money
Gon head, drop it down for me
And I'ma drum it, drum it, drum it, drum it
Streets on lock
Keys on drop
I share that piece of pie
But please don't drop (Run)
Streets so cold
N!gga might need my coat
Walk in like fee fi foe
I don't even see my folks

[Verse 2]
You know a nigga stay blunted, blunted
And the city tatted on my stomach, dummies
Said soon as niggas start actin' funny
Throw two's up, Bugs Bunny Bunny
Girl, choose up and throw that cunty cunty
I ain't even seen that shit comin'
Ass out like a plumber, plumber
Drop down and make that shit plummet
Pay me somethin' or just leave me alone
Money gettin' real Nia Long
Ever since shit start goin' right
I got a real hard time bein' wrong
Niggas say they got a major key
Still ain't even got a key to home
Homies keep on tellin' me to stop
Playin' with 'em, I'ma keep it goin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll hold it down for my niggas
Give 'em a pound and we twistin'
Snakes in the grass, hear 'em hissin'
They livin' lies and I'm a livin' legend

[Chorus]
What you really, really want from me?
Hatin' niggas oughta run from me
Why they always tryna come for me?
Swear they wanna feel the drumma drumma drummin
What these bitches really want from me?
We been here spendin' lunch money
Gon head, drop it down for me
And I'ma drum it, drum it, drum it, drum it
Streets on lock
Keys on drop
I share that piece of pie
But please don't drop (Run)
Streets so cold
N!gga might need my coat
Walk in like fee fi foe
I don't even see my folks

[Outro]
What these niggas really wan't from me
Aight
