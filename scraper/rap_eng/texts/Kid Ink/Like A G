[Chorus: Travis Porter]
I'mma tell you what a G told me
Cash rules everything around me
Gotta get that dough 'til there ain't no more
Gotta stack that dough 'til ya bank don't fold
I'mma show you what a nigga showed me
Put your middle finger up and scream fuck the police
Fuck smelling good gotta stank on me
Fuck a credit card gotta bank on me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, feeling so good, all the way out the hood, now I gotta view that can see the whole city
Swear momma raised her a real go-getter, yeah
It'll be okay, tell 'em that I'm so LA
West up, shoe box money in the dresser
Yeah, that's what a G showed me
I know you can smell the OG on me
And shawty tryna get another drink on me
Ain't a thing in the world for free baby

[Chorus: Travis Porter]
I'mma tell you what a G told me
Cash rules everything around me
Gotta get that dough 'til there ain't no more
Gotta stack that dough 'til ya bank don't fold
I'mma show you what a nigga showed me
Put your middle finger up and scream fuck the police
Fuck smelling good gotta stank on me
Fuck a credit card gotta bank on me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Just tryna have a fun time, middle finger up to the one time
Fist to my niggas on the front line, shades out, we gon' shine
Yeah, see us, just ball in my sneakers
They ain't getting money like a pre-nun, see it going around, tea cups
G thing
Travie got her in her G-string
And I could make her sing like T-Pain
Let me give you the game now

[Chorus: Travis Porter]
I'mma tell you what a G told me
Cash rules everything around me
Gotta get that dough 'til there ain't no more
Gotta stack that dough 'til ya bank don't fold
I'mma show you what a nigga showed me
Put your middle finger up and scream fuck the police
Fuck smelling good gotta stank on me
Fuck a credit card gotta bank on me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Live by the G code, on another level get a cheat code
Keep it 100, C note, party everywhere that we go
Oh uh alright, Bat Gang, up all night
Night night night, see, everything ain't what it seem, but

[Chorus: Travis Porter]
I'mma tell you what a G told me
Cash rules everything around me
Gotta get that dough 'til there ain't no more
Gotta stack that dough 'til ya bank don't fold
I'mma show you what a nigga showed me
Put your middle finger up and scream fuck the police
Fuck smelling good gotta stank on me
Fuck a credit card gotta bank on me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
