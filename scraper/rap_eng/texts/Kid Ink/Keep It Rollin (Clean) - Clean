I said go on put your lighters up (what you smoking)
You can smell it over there, back (ain't even open)
With your girlfriend getting high
And we smoking, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling (been tryna smoke another one)
Just keep it rolling
Just keep it rolling
You ain't gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

They would think that it was Christmas (how I got her open)
You can see it in her poker face
(I got her falling)
Baby girl if you getting high
(I got the potion)
Now them hoes ain't choosing, nigga
I'm already chosen
I ain't blind I can see you hate
(I keep it rolling)
They just mad cause they not here, and I'm the opposite of cold
And I'm getting fast money, yeah the opposite of cold
And they might stay well try get another bottle from that hostess
With a pocket full of trojans
(You can call me Roman)
Kid Ink the entertainer they be wishing and they hoping that
I'm a take her home cause this the after party
Get turnt up we already got started

I said go on put your lighters up (what you smoking)
You can smell it over there, back (ain't even open)
With your girlfriend getting high
And we smoking, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling (been tryna smoke another one)
Just keep it rolling
Just keep it rolling
You ain't gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

I ain't ever gone stop no, (no)
I keep it going
Walking like a giant, fi-fye-foing
Tatts everywhere, scarface Lil Tony
They don't ever tell me no
They say yes like Lil Corey
And I'm smoking on some good (good)
You for it, put my CD on
She gone thank you for it
Kid Ink baby, say hi to the bad guy
Only one year and I ain't nothing like the last guy
In the club, mmm. it's alright
We can leave we ain't gotta stay all night
Know, it's OG waiting back home
Lil kid you can feel it in your back bone

I said go on put your lighters up (what you smoking)
You can smell it over there, back (ain't even open)
With your girlfriend getting high
And we smoking, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling (been tryna smoke another one)
Just keep it rolling
Just keep it rolling
You ain't gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

I don't know about you, but I'm living in the moment
You can hate if you want but I'm a keep it rolling
Gotta super bad bitch full of lights and for it
Giving hickies all night
Just keep it rolling babe

This the part when you get your lighters out, in the air just keep it rolling baby
(Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling)
