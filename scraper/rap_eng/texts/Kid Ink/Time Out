[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Hook]
Said it's the way that you've been actin' lately
I might have to put you on time out
Poppin' off like you're not my baby
I might have to put you on time out
Said time out, time out
I might have to put you on time out
Time out, time out
Time out
I might have to put you on time out

[Verse 1]
Cause you always trippin'
Always trippin'
As soon as my cell phone die
You think that I'm out there trickin'
What I'm gon' do?
Walk in the room and it's bitches all 'round
Said, if you was here
I wouldn't be actin' no different, calm down
I know you got spies in the room
Tryna act like they eyes to the room
Tryna see if I'ma pour a girl a drink
She just need a little ice for her juice
I got no reason to lie
I got no DMs to hide
And you ain't got no place to go
It's 3 in the morning

[Hook]
Said it's the way that you've been actin' lately
I might have to put you on time out
Poppin' off like you're not my baby
I might have to put you on time out
Said time out, time out
I might have to put you on time out
Time out, time out
I might have to put you on time out

[Verse 2]
I don't understand why
Why you like wasting my time
Talkin' 'bout shit, and women that's irrelevant
I know that you're tired, girl you been runnin' your lips
Show me some pics
Damn, you prolly got pics
Prolly look worse than it really is
Now I gotta fix it and buy you some heels in the Hills
You only wear Js when they match mine
Girl this ain't nothin' like the last time
I know that we had a couple issues
And you think I'm just sayin' that I miss you
But I got no reason to lie
I got no DMs to hide
And you tryna play
Like you won't forget me in the morning

[Hook]
Said it's the way that you've been actin' lately
I might have to put you on time out
Poppin' off like you're not my baby
I might have to put you on time out
Said time out, time out
I might have to put you on time out
Time out, time out
I might have to put you on time out

[Bridge]
Time out, said
Right now
I'm right here, girl
Why you so loud?
Time out, said
Right now
You're always killin' the mood
That shit ain't cute

[Hook]
Said it's the way that you've been actin' lately
I might have to put you on time out
Poppin' off like you're not my baby
I might have to put you on time out
Said time out, time out
I might have to put you on time out
Time out, time out
I might have to put you on time out
