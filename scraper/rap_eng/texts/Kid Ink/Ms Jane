[Chorus]
She's the only one I care about, yeah
My baby really knocks me out, gone
We're as happy as can be, ha
She's really got a hold on me

[Verse 1]
Ms. Jane, I just want to tell you that I love you
I love you so high, never put no one above you Ms
There's something about the things that you do to me
I'mma break you down into little pieces
Yeah, you such a knock out, the sky is the limit and I ride clouds
You say you got that fire can I try it now? Looking up to the heaven but I'm high as hell
Roll another one? Might as well, it ain't nothing but a word and I excel
You got me on another level, never hard to find I'm connected like a Lego
Every time we ride got to roll up all the windows
Feeling smoky as a train I can barely see a thing man
Don't want to be without her, nope
Every single night can't sleep without her cause

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ms. Jane, I just want to tell you that I love you
I love you so high never put no one above you
There's something about the things that you do to me
I'mma break you down into little pieces
We have such a great time, birthday 4/20 we the same sign, go
Smile when I look into your green eyes, split a swisher down, B-line
You got my mind in a daze, so we party hard like it's the end of our days
Amen any higher, I'mma take a trip to Heaven, she's my medic relieve my headache, oh
Dr. Jane but I call her Misses
Only need 30 minutes and I'm already missing her
Don't want to be without her
Every single day can't leave without her cause

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ms. Jane I just want to tell you that I love you
So high never put no one above you
There's something about the things that you do to me
I'mma break you down into little pieces
