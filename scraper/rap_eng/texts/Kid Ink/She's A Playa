[Chorus]
Tell her she's a PLAYER, never trust her, she's a
PIMPPO, must have a been a girl that I met on the low
PLAYER, don't give her nothing, she's a
PIMPPO, never give her money cause you know she a stunner
PLAYER never trust her, she's a
PIMPOO, must have a been a girl that I met on the low
PLAYER, don't give her nothing, she's a
PIMPPO, never give her money cause you know she a stunner

[Verse 1]
Nah, you can never trust her
Cute face but, down-deep she a hustler
Know just how to walk, how to talk, how to touch you
Make a nigga fall in love, it's a wrap, you a sucker now
Every time I come around
It's money season and she tryna hunt me down
So I gotta move it carefully, but every time I leave
She pulls me right back in like gravity
It's crazy, even have my lady tell me that she's bad too
Fucking with a attitude
So you know I had to do what I had to do
Got 'em at the same time watch it when it's game time

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Said she's a superwoman, got pussy powers
Man-eater, don't get devoured
Watch out, it could be trouble
She know how to break it down, turn you into rubble
Never on that bull, money's the agenda
And her calendar is full, get it how she got to
And she never lose her cool, got you niggas fooled
Know how to play a role, she deserve a Golden Globe, tell 'em
I know how to handle her
Get her to my room and dismantle her
Take her from the bed to the mantle
Hit the floor, knock the lights out, better get a candle

[Chorus]
