[Hook]
Uh
We got it hotter than a stove
I'm looking I'm looking I'm looking for
The one, come and get me in the zone
Is it you, is it you come and let me know
Is it you, is it you, is it you over there
Is it you, is it you, is it you there
You got it, you got it,you got it I swear
You got it, you got it,you got it I swear

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm looking all across the room
For the one, maybe two
If you in the mood
For a little bit of new-new
Give me your number like sudoku
That dress shorter than a tutu
My view is so beautiful that
I can't help but stare, help but stare
Steer away from your friends
And pull right over here
You should come and chill
Just be easy like a lay-up and
Let my money talk
Baby you ain't got to say nothing
Nah, I ain't tryin' to run game
But I play to win
Is it you, is it you
Let me see your hands
We got it hot
Right out of the pan baby
I can make you scream like my number one fan
Now, tell me how does that sound
Neighbours might complain but you know I love that loud
That loud, tell me how does it sound to the
Neighbours might complain but we never turn it down

[Hook]
Uh
We got it hotter than a stove
I'm looking I'm looking I'm looking for
The one, come and get me in the zone
Is it you, is it you come and let me know
Is it you, is it you, is it you over there
Is it you, is it you, is it you there
You got it, you got it,you got it I swear
You got it, you got it,you got it I swear

[Verse 2]
Why you tryin' to play cool
They might be confused but
Ain't nobody fooled over here
I could tell from how you move
That you ready and prepared
By yourself, like you playin' solitaire
Come and share some with me
If you ever need a bodyguard like Whitney
I'll be all over you fast like Ricky, Bobby
Tell them it's no problem on the low
No comment baby we can get it poppin' now
I ain't tryin' to run game, but I play to win
Is it you, is it you, let me see your dance
We got it hot, might leave with a tan baby
I can make you scream
But you ain't gotta be scared of it
Tell me how does that sound
Neighbours might complain but you know I love that loud
That loud, tell me how does it sound to the
Neighbours might complain but we never turn it down

[Hook]
Uh
We got it hotter than a stove
I'm looking I'm looking I'm looking for
The one, come and get me in the zone
Is it you, is it you come and let me know
Is it you, is it you, is it you over there
Is it you, is it you, is it you there
You got it, you got it,you got it I swear
You got it, you got it,you got it I swear

[Outro]
We been at it all night, act like
It don't mean a thing but it's alright
You know what it is
Going down for whatever whenever give you
The bussiness know I got that work
If you ready for it
Is it you, is it you, is it you
Let me know you're ready for it
Is it you, is it you
Put your hands in the air
And let me know you ready for it
