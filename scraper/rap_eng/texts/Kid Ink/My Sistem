I got a problem and I try to tell myself it's something different
But it ain't nothing new, I gotta have it in my system, in my system
I've been fiending for a feeling, if you with it come and dip it
And if you ain't no, I ain't tripping but
I need it in my system, my system, my system, my system
I don't know about you but I need it in my system
My system, my system, my system, my system
I don't know about you but I need it in

My car, my swisher, my drugs, my bitches
See 'em pump in their faces, man, this feeling is officially in my system
You tripping, we whiling, safari
Probably won't remember much tonight, apologize and sorry

I done had too many sips of this Patrone up in my system
Baby, don't be too pretentious, ain't nobody paying attention
Do your dance, do your dance just don't drop that thun thun thun
From a whistle go ahead and dip your finger in this Honda
Got a problem, no denial, keep it real with my addiction
Call me Tim the ' Tailor if you need a fucking fixer
Puffing loud, hear me now, all you gotta do is listen
Drink strong, man, I feel like I've been lifting, come and get it

[Hook]

My trunk, my system, the drums, it's kicking
The drugs, it's kicking, I'm drunk, believe it
If you sober you tripping, somebody get him a cane
I'm with the dream team drinking, no champion shit champagne

Now I done had too many sips of different mixes in my system
All these women in my section, it get hard to pay attention
That's my bad, that's your bad, ain't nobody you could be mad at
Aiming for your melon, every shot automatic
Going crazy in this bitch like all the walls are padded
Not in my right mind but my bitch right at the pageant
Tell her keep on rolling kush, sticky as molasses
See a whole in the swisher, don't worry, baby, I'll patch it
