[Chorus]
Yeah shawty do her thing in the club
But you should see her when I get her home
Wheen she dancing on my bed
Dancing on my bed
Said this is her favourite song
And she party all night long
When she dancing on my bed
Dancing on my bed

[Verse 1]
Yeah, gon' hop up on my server
Deaf in the sheets, do some things you never heard of
Come up out that water, watch, you could call me Rambo
Hop up on my bed, you could turn that shit into a dance floor
She got the bomb, true that
Blow that pussy up, boom cat
Got her begging for the John, Hughsack
Move that body all around like a Rubix
Like you, man you should have seen her
Dancing on my bed like a ballerina
Legs in the air, high mile club
Two pack shawty, all eyes on us

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I love the way she be dancing on my bed
I love the way she be dancing on my, dancing on my bed

[Chorus]
Yeah shawty do her thing in the club
But you should see her when I get her home
Wheen she dancing on my bed
Dancing on my bed
Said this is her favourite song
And she party all night long
When she dancing on my bed
Dancing on my bed

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you fine, thank God for a pair of eyes
Cause I could watch you all night like a marathon
Name ain't Lucy but I love the way you dancing on
My bed, blow my mind, atom bomb
And I be there to catch you if you fall
We in a room full of smoke, looking like the fog
It's okay to sprawl on this California king
And let this California nigga give you California dreams girl

[Chorus]
Yeah shawty do her thing in the club
But you should see her when I get her home
Wheen she dancing on my bed
Dancing on my bed
Said this is her favourite song
And she party all night long
When she dancing on my bed
Dancing on my bed
