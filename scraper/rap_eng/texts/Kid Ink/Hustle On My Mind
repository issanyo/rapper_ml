Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day

You know I try to shine, don’t matter what they say today
I’m always on my mind, wouldn’t have it no other way
These I keep in mind, ‘cause they ain’t going give it to me

Hustle on my mind, working hard every day

Imma be okay, imma be alright
Imma be okay, imma be alright

Came from the bottom, now I’m above, looking down
When I hit the stage everybody’s screaming Sean Brown

Many nights with no sleep, ride a doubt for my team
At the scene they’re making noise, acting like they know me
Grind hard, put in work, hard boot, sweaty shirt
But it sweat, tears for this, matter of fact, to shit with this
Off to came, master calls, past hubs, several hoes
Kept in my mind and imma flow even when I was broke
Still broke, I still go, harder than the next man
Gotta make it for the fans, turn the head every two a day
Making it with no hand outs, remember when I was too stressed out
In my mind got it out, go without it, fuck the trouble
The long line I’m here to take, heard us out, that beauty train
But making it is not what it seems, somebody just want a piece
Was it with me, sure be rare, you know the rest imaging
Make the most holiday, let it slade into the air

Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day

You know I try to shine, don’t matter what they say today
I’m always on my mind, wouldn’t have it no other way
These I keep in mind, ‘cause they ain’t going give it to me

Hustle on my mind, working hard every day

Imma be okay, imma be alright
Imma be okay, imma be alright

Alright, we hustle, hustle, hustle, try to live like rustle
All the way from the rebel, made a way from the struggle
Could it put a little way, but I use my brain muscle
Now these niggers on my head like a motherfucker muscle
But I ain’t scared, no, I ain’t mad, no
It comes with the territory
My life was a hook, west side story
I’m a man in this society, Wile E. Coyote
Try to put me down, but I’m higher than your ask, I see
I got more years, yeah, you heard me
Probably had a murder shit and burn it to the third degree
I’m man in my city, feeling like phiddy
Night shines in, got the unit here with me
Some alone now, bad game, say something
We are a one for a million
They won’t give it to me so I had to go and get it
Always money on my mind, they ain’t dreaming about a million

You know I try to shine, don’t matter what they say today
I’m always on my mind, wouldn’t have it no other way
These I keep in mind, ‘cause they ain’t going give it to me

Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day
Hustle on my mind, working hard every day

You know I try to shine, don’t matter what they say today
I’m always on my mind, wouldn’t have it no other way
These I keep in mind, ‘cause they ain’t going give it to me

Hustle on my mind, working hard every day

Imma be okay, imma be alright
Imma be okay, imma be alright
