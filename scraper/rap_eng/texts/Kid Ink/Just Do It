(Verse: Kid Ink)
I ain’t tryna put no pressure on a blessing
I just gotta let you know (know)
What you working with is special
Don’t just let it go to waste, without giving a little effort
Bad teacher you could give these good girls a fucking lesson, hear me?
Off that loud like a hemi, little bit of coke, little Henny
All she need for the turn up
Make all them other bitches envy
Keep going till everything empty (go)
At first she was actin iffy (what)
But all that changed once the DJ said my name
Okay

D-d-do it, (do it) do it, (do it)
Just do it
