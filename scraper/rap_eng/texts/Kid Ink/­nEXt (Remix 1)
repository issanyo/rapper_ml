[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Now, here we go, no reason again
Still it's no place I'd rather be in the end
But, right here, I stare in your bright eyes
Goin' back and forth like Aaliyah
Sayin' different things, knowin' we lie
It's no limit to the sky long as we fly

[Verse 2: Sevyn Streeter]
Together, Forever
I would never, never let you go
See now soon as we say that, we at war
Surrender, somethin we don't know

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Something between us, certain fire in our love
Its unreleasable, unbelievable
We're miserable apart, but together it's so hard
All I need to know, ohh all I need to know

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
My ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
I need to know, whooaahooah ohh

[Verse 3: Sevyn Streeter]
Mhmm, every time we break up
We turn around and we make up
Momma wonder when I'm gon' wake up
But he love my face with no make-up
And every time I call him
We end up having a problem
And I know we'll probably never solve it
Hmmm, but damn I really love him

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Something between us, certain fire in our love
Its unreleasable, unbelievable
We're miserable apart, but together it's so hard
All I need to know, ohh all I need to know

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
My ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
I need to know, whooaahooah ohh

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
I won't leave, two feet to the asphalt
Don't I get you everything you ask for?
Might say, tonight was the last straw
But in the mornin' I'll be sippin' from your glass jar
One fix fix everything, blat, hammer
Never been a pimp or a backhander
Know you been around the block, hit a bad gramma
It don't matter, we'll make it through the madness

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
My ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
I need to know, whooaahooah ohh
