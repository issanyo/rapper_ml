[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Don't shut me out
Stop shuttin' down
Just let me know
Everythin' you been thinkin' 'bout
I can't read your mind
But I could read between the lines
But your attitude
And everythin' addin' to it

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, it's clear, I can see
That you got a beef
Sayin' that's not with me
But ooh, don't know what I believe
All honesty
It's like playin' the lottery with you

[Chorus]
Let's not leave divided
Come stand right beside me
Promise not to leave me out
Said you know where to find me
This is somethin' we should figure out
Before we leave the lobby
Baby, let's not fight in Vegas, face it
I know we wasted, yeah, yeah
Baby, let's not fight in Vegas
We do this every single time and then we make up
Soon as we make love
Let's not fight in Vegas
Sorry if I'm faded
But we on vacation
And I ain't had no time off in motherfuckin' ages
You got your gown and I'm sauced up
I'm just tryna hit the tables
Girl, and boss up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, it's clear, I can see
That you got a beef
Sayin' that's not with me
But ooh, don't know what I believe
All honesty
It's like playin' the lottery with you

[Chorus]
Let's not leave divided
Come stand right beside me
Promise not to leave me out
Said you know where to find me
This is somethin' we should figure out
Before we leave the lobby
Baby, let's not fight in Vegas, face it
I know we wasted, yeah, yeah
Baby, let's not fight in Vegas
We do this every single time and then we make up
Soon as we make love
Let's not fight in Vegas

[Bridge]
Let's not
Baby, let's not fight in Vegas, face it
I know we wasted
Baby, let's not fight in Vegas

[Outro]
Let's not fight in Vegas, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
