[Verse 1: King Los]
I got a couple new Roleys with a couple frozen bands
My niggas squeeze arms like a couple holding hands
Nigga VRROOM! Tryna flip that Maserati over
Smelling like izzy miyaki and my fly Versace loafers, nigga wait
Drop them hunndits, and Tony pop that perfect
I Jump in the drop murk it while bumping the locks, Porsche
Nigga wait,My shades probably cost a thousand
Fly to death, private jets flying across an island
I said, just let me explain, I was just in Spain, pump this in your brain
Nigga I'mma get this change, Puffy told me slow down
I said woah now that's a no now, nigga it's about to go down
