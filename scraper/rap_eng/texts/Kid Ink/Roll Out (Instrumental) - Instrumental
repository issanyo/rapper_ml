I know, they ain't know what I'm on
Sorry, excuse me, how I'm feeling right now
Soon they gonna understand it
Tried to do it like me
You can tell 'em I'm a beast
I'm a dog, then let me off the leash
Now I'm coming for 'em all
Man I need another drink
It's the last call
Just give me a minute
Let me show 'em how I ball
And we'll roll out
Let's roll out
Let's roll out
Let's roll out
We can roll out

Live, reporting from the cockpit
Red eyes but I'm trying to get my mind clear
Celebratin' like we just won a contest
No contest, motherfuckers couldn't digest
What I'm on, man on my own
Benz on deck, you ain't gotta blow my horn
Paint a perfect picture like Frida Kahlo
Red or green pill, don't trip just swallow that
And gon' have the time in your life
On me, no strings, up high as a kite
Watch a Molly turn a straight girl
Right into a dike soon you will understand
By the end of the night, tell 'em

I know they ain't know what I'm all
Sorry, excuse me, I'm feeling right now
Soon they gonna understand it
Tried to do it like me
You can tell 'em I'm a beast
I'm a dog, then let me off the leash
Now I'm coming for 'em all
Man I need another drink
It's the last call
Just give me a minute
Let me show 'em how I bought
And we'll roll out
Let's roll out
Let's roll out
Let's roll out
We can roll out

Just sayin', I need to get a point across
Somebody find these niggas 'cause they fucking lost
Tryin' to be the boss, couldn't pay the cost
Let my chain speak for me, we ain't gotta talk
I go, to the bottles, hallow, smoking on diablo
Smelling like patrone, and Mark Jacobs calogne
Up and away new generation apolishing
So ready to roll, and rock out
These lames can't ball like the NBA lockout
Hit em' in the head, might pull a knot out
Show these motherfuckers what they not 'bout
Tell 'em

I know they ain't know what I'm all
Sorry, excuse me, I'm feeling right now
Soon they gonna understand it
Tried to do it like me
You can tell 'em I'm a beast
I'm a dog, then let me off the leash
Now I'm coming for 'em all
Man I need another drink
It's the last call
Just give me a minute
Let me show 'em how I bought
And we'll roll out
Let's roll out
Let's roll out
Let's roll out
