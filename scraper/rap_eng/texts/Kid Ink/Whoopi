[Chorus: Kid Ink (Meek Mill Sample)]
Diamonds in my chain, Whoopi Goldberg
Black as shit
Black as shit, black as shit, black as shit, black as shit
Black as shit, black as shit, black as shit, black as shit)

Take a look at my fish, my whip, my bitch, my chain
My shades, my tats, I ain't playing that ain't everything
Take a look at my fish, my whip, my bitch, my chain
My shades, my tats, that gat, get back a bit

[Verse 1]
Uh, and you know it ain't no accident
Club over capacity, lights out, black as shit
Two up, rabbit ears, shots like Maverick
Show her to the car, and then I show her where my mattress is
Uh, know I run this shit, gon' lap a bitch
Made it with this rapping but my friends all trapping still
Black mask and shit, plays like a quarterback
Wrap it up, package that, flip it like a acrobat
It just come with the habitat
Black on black, rack on rack
Tat on tat, stack on stack
Back on back, reason why your girl and me grab on that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uh, see it in my attitude
On one, hella rude
All black, outfits well done
Fresh to death, fuck around and kill something
Got a swag, everybody tryna steal from me
I swear I beat 'em down like a steel drummer
Can't see nobody, obvious
Shades on, room black as shit, hockey puck
If it's popping over there
Then it's probably us
Pulled up 6 cars, fuck a party bus
Bat Gang, we in here

[Chorus]
