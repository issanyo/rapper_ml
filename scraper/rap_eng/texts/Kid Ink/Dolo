[Intro: R. Kelly]
Lemme see

[Hook: R. Kelly & Kid Ink]
Lookin' 'round the room
Said, I don't see no one else but you alone
Said, I don't see no one else
Tell me, did you come over, dolo, dolo
Tell me, did you come over, dolo
You ain't gotta leave by yourself, ya hear

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah, everything is a go doe
I been lookin at you dance like a Go-Go
Girl, hold that for the photo
Ain't got drink in your cup, that's a no-no
(Lookin' 'round the room)
Uh, and I don't see no one through the smoke
Roll like I got no lungs
But you the only thing that I notice, dolo
Saying you ain't gotta leave solo
Just go on throw it at me like Romo
Sittin' in the club, big sea full of fish
And I'm giving you all my attention, said

[Hook]
Lookin' 'round the room
Said, I don't see no one else but you alone
Said, I don't see no one else
Tell me, did you come over, dolo, dolo
Tell me, did you come over, dolo
You ain't gotta leave by yourself, ya hear

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
And you could bring your friends
To meet my friends over in my section
VIP every week, got a residence
Now baby go on bring it back, I'm tryna reminisce
You remind, you remind, you remind me
Of something that I'm missing, don't know what it is yet
Send a full bag, gotta come with submission
I be two on, everything on a million, po' up
Just let me know and we can be out
Keys over at the valet kiosk
Saying that you came here dolo
Probably got a man, I'ma act like I don't know though

[Hook]
Lookin' 'round the room
Said, I don't see no one else but you alone
Said, I don't see no one else
Tell me, did you come over, dolo, dolo
Tell me, did you come over, dolo
You ain't gotta leave by yourself, ya hear
Did you come over, dolo, dolo
Tell me, did you come over, dolo
You ain't gotta leave by yourself, ya hear

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
You ain't tryna get money, what you come for?
You ain't tryna show nothing, what you come for?
Get to bouncing that ass like a pogo
Pause, that's a photo
Body so dumb I'ma call it body dodo
Face so pretty girl you should be a logo
Lead singer, solo, leave with me, I'll go
We can make moments that we'll never forget
I'm talking 'bout champagne and candles lit
Cause baby girl you deserve that shit, yeah
Cause you work that pole like your bills' overdue
Got so much talent I'm thinking 'bout sponsoring you
Gotta know first...

[Hook]
Did you come over, dolo, dolo
Tell me, did you come over, dolo
You ain't gotta leave by yourself, ya hear

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Lookin' round the room
See no one else but you alone
I don't see no one else, tell me did you come?
You ain't gotta leave by yourself
Tell me did you come?
