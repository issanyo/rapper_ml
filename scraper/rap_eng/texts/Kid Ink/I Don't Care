[Intro: Kid Ink & Maejor Ali]
Aye girl
I don't really care what everybody got to say (oh no I don't)
I don't really care what everybody got to say (oh no I don't, no I don't)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Ok I don't really care what everybody gotta say
Bitches tell me that they love me, they be lying to my face
That's the price you gotta pay you want to live the life of fame
It's been like this for forever, I don't know no other way
I don't really care what everybody trying to do
I've been on my own shit and staying loyal to the crew
Got a ride-or-die bitch, she's staying loyal to this dick
She know I be working hard and I ain't coming home til 6
Baby God is my witness, I'm a die before I fail
Way too much drive, better click, you see me dead
While I light another L of that fire straight from hell
I just need a little time, but ain't never needed help

[Hook: Maejor Ali & Kid Ink, Kid Ink]
I don't really care what everybody got to say
I hear them talking but they ain't saying nothing, no
I don't really care what everybody gotta say
First they love then they hate, it be changing every day
So don't believe what they tell you
Don't believe what they say
Don't believe what they tell you
Don't believe, don't believe what they say

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I said I ain't really tripping on how everybody move
Riding in my own lane, feeling like I got the juice
Tell the truth, ah-choo! I'm allergic to the fake
Never ever gave a fuck, they used to say it was a phase
But I'm still riding round with my middle finger up
Top down on a gown, put them titties in the air
See them looking at me now like that nigga got a nerve
I ain't worried, keep tipping, watch them all turn round
And bust down to the ground
I've been bustin my balls tryna put on for my town
Never put in the towel, put that vow on my vouch
Fuck the judgement and trial, don't nobody make a sound

[Hook: Maejor Ali & Kid Ink, Kid Ink]
I don't really care what everybody got to say
I hear them talking but they ain't saying nothing, no
I don't really care what everybody gotta say
First they love then they hate, it be changing every day
So don't believe what they tell you
Don't believe what they say
Don't believe what they tell you
Don't believe, don't believe what they say

[Bridge: Maejor Ali]
You know, sometimes in life, you just gotta go for it
You can't listen to what the next person saying how they feel
You listening?

[Outro: Maejor Ali]
I don't really care what everybody gotta say (oh no I don't)
I don't really care what everybody gotta say (oh no I don't, no I don't)
