Daily Beloved, We are gathered here tonight
In celebration of a new day, A new voice
A new world
Yeah, trick or treat, mask on its halloween
Above the clouds so im drinkin like im Charlie Sheen
Outfit is last .. fashion week
Contemplatin takin my bitch to a brassery
After class i had to misses do my homework
While i smoked a J, then i bone her
Billion dollar dreams i'm getting closer
Politicing with my jewish friends keep it kosher
Went from poverty, to buyin property
To having R-N-B b*tches ridin on top of me
Now the fake rap niggas is makin a mockery
Of the culture we've built worst than a robbery
Critically aclaimed, 3 syllable name
Cleaner than mineral water in a criminal vein
Married to the game, dress her in ?veroan?
Shake down to the casquet

Chorus:
Mom's had the struggle, pap's wasn't there
Raised by the streets middle finger in the air
I'm a billionaire, a slumdog billionaire
Back from the dead, strap no fed
East to the west, say my name and i appear
I'm a billionaire, a slumdog billionaire
A slumdog billionaire

All black sipping white wine
We've been waiting for this night for a life time
You can hear the pain through the mic line
Speakin from the heart dear valentine

Slumdog fresh outta the kettle
Headed to my sweet, but the label won't pay for my dental
On the road to riches, Came a long way from a demo
--------------------------------------------
Somebody betta wake em, tell em where i came from
Pop's wasn't there, nigga stay caged up
I was playin toss with the neighbors, so if you see em
Tell em i dont needa favor, im good, (good)
Smokin on that good, swisher sweet no backwood
Gettin show money, no pay stubs
I dont give a fuck in this bitch, kanye shook?

Chorus:
Mom's had the struggle, pap's wasn't there
Raised by the streets middle finger in the air
I'm a billionaire, a slumdog billionaire
Back from the dead, strap no fed
East to the west, say my name and i appear
I'm a billionaire, a slumdog billionaire
A slumdog billionaire

...broken down with the coke
Got my ..money..got the dough music
Fish..fish..fake nigga ...real nigga show in love
... big bodies, rolling in big ...
Sticky they call the ... get the paper straight
...with the substance...and even when i try to pass go
There's no way i can keep the ...

[Chorus:]
