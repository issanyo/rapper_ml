[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Look up
We...

[Partial Hook]
Spaced out, you know what I stay about
Let go of your mind now
Baby you ain’t never been this high
We... spaced out, you know what I stay about
Let me take you far, got you sittin' with the stars
We...

[Verse 1]
Spaced out, tools up, haters down
Baby slow it up, like the H-town
Be a long night if you stay around
I hope, you ready for it
Feeling so high need Betty Ford
One whiff smell like a forest
Take a hit, feel the kick like Nike force
And I’m on, faded in
Turn up, don’t fade me out
We in this bitch like Indians
Just made it rain, tell ‘em fuck a drought
I’ve been doing this shit since high school
Smokin’ on good, clubs in Hollywood
Yeah it’s okay gonna have your turn
LA my city, bout to do it big worm on a mothafucka
Friday, every day, my way
Tell Simon to do what I say
You got fire roll up that bombay
And we gone, outta here
Smokin’ on them cobwebs
Top floor of the building like Spider man
Ain’t nobody higher than
Yeah
We...

[Hook]
Spaced out, you know what I stay about
Let go of your mind now
Baby you ain’t never been this high
We... spaced out, you know what I stay about
Let me take you far, got you sittin' with the stars
We... spaced out, spaced out, spaced out
Let go of your mind now
Baby you ain't never been this high
We... spaced out, spaced out, spaced out)
Let me take you far, got you sittin' with the stars
We...

[Verse 2]
Uh on a whole ‘nother planet
Feelin’ so fly, niggas can’t stand it
Know I stay lit like a scented candle
Can’t focus, better fix your cameras
Going on a ride that you can’t handle
Better grab a handle, baby I’m a handful
Cottonmouth got me spittin’ like a camel
Wild animal, ain’t no telling what I’m gonna land on
Watch out, I’m stoned sittin' in a glass house
With that loud and you quiet as a mouse
Bart Simpson nigga sittin’ on the couch ah
Clouds, start the show
Just break it down, it's a art to roll
Call me quick draw, can’t see the colors
Ain't nobody above us
Yeah, we
