[Verse 1]
La, la, la
Put it in the air, blunt so thick, got it looking like a flare
Eyes sitting low like I'm looking at a glare
Got your bitch in the stands and she's looking at a player
I never gave a fuck and I really don't care
Running circles round you niggas but you're really just squares
And you can't see me nigga cause your vision's impaired
I look better in the front like a set of veneers
Tell them hoes, flight down, flights out
All black, lights out
You know what it is, no time outs
Bitches going down, fly south
You getting played by the doorman
While I'm in this bitch getting paid for performing
Big bang 808, knock like the Mormons
See a bunch of hoes, tell the bouncer bring more in

[Hook]
You already know where I'm from so go ahead take another hit of the
I see you on the skyline, this high got me singing to the sky light
This high got me singing to the sky light, this hgh got me singing to the sky light
I just need a little time to get my mind right, see a couple pretty girls looking fine light

[Verse 2]
Holly, Wood in her body, just roll up about to blow up like Saudi
Find me, riding in space with Wall-e, eunning from the cops like Rodney, don't mind me
Cause I ain't psychic, I'm just doing it like Nike
Sitting on a cloud like Zeus, just Skyping and I swear my bitch bad like Aphrodite
Fiesty, up through the nightly, Batman shorty
Tell her turn around and I back stabbed shorty
Put her right to sleep, yeah, I knapsack shorty
And I roll another one like a fat ass hoagie
Said I'm on some no buffer shit
You should get a load of it
Great, anything less will be lonely
We welcome to the la, la, la one from nigga all I hear is ra, ra, ra, tell 'em

[Hook]
You already know where I'm from so go ahead take another hit of the
I see you on the skyline, this pack got me singing to the sky light
This high got me singing to the sky light, this high got me singing to the sky light
I just need a little time to get my mind right, see a couple pretty girls looking fine light, looking fine light
This high got me singing to the sky light, this high got me singing to the sky light
