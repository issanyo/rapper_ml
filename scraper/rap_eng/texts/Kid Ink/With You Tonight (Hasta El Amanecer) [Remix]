[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Kid Ink
Hold up, hold up my baby
You not the ordinary
Fire just hit my light to
And I see the way you dance when it's all night

You like come on and you stop the foaming
Can't right the wrongs, keep it real
I been tryna keep it nice and all
But my mind and the gutter only
I might kiss just to stutter on it

You know how to ride like it's butter on it
While I toast the champagne
Summer on the coast the side of P-C-H
But I'll be on the way when you call me

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]
Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
Want more than just your name
From where you came
Looking at you through me Ray-ban frames
Them girl a dime but girl you not the same
It's not you it's your mother me blame
Me want tell you straight
Let me explain
Keep it a hundred, come ride on the wave
Come through your tunnel up in my train
Just cause me flyer than a plane

You gon' call me papi
I'll make your body happy
Every time that you call me
You know that I'll take care of you

You gon' call me papi
I'll make your body happy
Every time that you call me
You know I want you, baby

[Bridge: Nicky Jam]
Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight

Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight
(I wanna leave with you)

[Chorus]
Girl you know that I'll do anything
To know a little more than just your name
Only thing I know is you're too fine
And I would like to leave with you tonight
