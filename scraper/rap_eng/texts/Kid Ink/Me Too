[Verse 1: Los]
Get me mad I'ma pull up on your lawn in a Lamb with a mink on
And leave the doors up nigga you a fan
I been the man since Cam had pink on
Yeah I'm up like a pimp, pinky finger up
When he sip his pimp cup with his ring on
Yes lord, I'ma king on this chess board
Do I got my Louie checker board thing on
Lot back jumpin got my block back jumpin'
Niggas shooting me, know a shot back coming
Cause I cock back dump it dump it dump it
Till the whole clip go click, go ahead with the bullshit
My whole clique got money out the ass
I could school niggas watch me get your honey out the class
Like a cool nigga tryna shake this money off the brass
What it do nigga? You don't fuck around and clash
With the B-A-D-B-O-Y He be
So fly to see me nigga go buy a TV or go buy me CD
Only way to play me lately, niggas
Fuck around and catch these rabies
The way these niggas biting
Feel like I'm fighting Tyson
But i'm floating like butterfly
And striking like I'm lightning
Cause I'm so Ali my cash is clay
Throw it up and make the asses say

[Bridge: Los]
Clap clap clap clap
Give me the money, boy, give me the money
Clap clap clap clap
If you want it, bitch, come get it from me
Cause I ain't stingy with it and I got a whole lot of it
If all them niggas is hating, I guess balling ain't in yo budget

[Hook: Jeremih]
My old bitch won't like this, she say I'm brand new
Her new nigga ain't like me, I do shit he can't do
Them fuck niggas gone hate me when I pull that thing through
If you was getting this much money you be acting like me too
You be acting like me too, acting like me too
You be acting like me too, acting like me too
Them fuck niggas gone hate me when I pull that thing through
If you was getting this much money you be acting like me too

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Ok, my old bitch don't like me, ame in with a new one
My old hood still love me, Grew up on a futon
No more food stamps, coupons, blue face, hundreds Money sure get everything
Gold, but it still got niggas in the street Making plays no coaching
Yeah, you'll be acting like me too Smoking on Cali good
Eyes look like T-2 Been going hard for too long never going
Broke again refuse Fuck yo' review check yo' replay
Just touched down tryna see you Young menace to society teach you
That West Side, W-West Side On my back need a massage
Match up you will get the message You ain't nothing but a mess guy
And you, looking real mess up And yo' bitch dirty like Kei$ha
And my bands up like Kesslers Yo' realness I question
Alumni rap, with a blunt full of the best
Take a look over here might feel like a movie
But to me it's straight
You see see be 4 niggas better cuff yo chick when you see me coming
My ex come in this bitch keep it real nigga might see me running

[Hook: Jeremih x2]
My old bitch won't like this, she say I'm brand new
Her new nigga ain't like me, I do shit he can't do
Them fuck niggas gone hate me when I pull that thing through
If you was getting this much money you be acting like me too
You be acting like me too, acting like me too
You be acting like me too, acting like me too
Them fuck niggas gone hate me when I pull that thing through
If you was getting this much money you be acting like me too
