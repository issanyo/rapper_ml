(INTRO:K-Young)

I mean you remind me of somethin'
I just can't think of what it is

(Hook:K-Young)

You remind me of the fire in my gun and
Kinda like my guitar the way ya body be strumming
Ooohh keep it coming cause I'm in need of yaaa

Your sex, drugs and rock n roll
Like oooohhh (I need it, I need it, I need it baby)
Your sex, drugs and rock n roll
Oooohhh (I need it, I need it, I need it baby)
Your sex, drugs and rock n roll

(Verse 1: Kid Ink)

Yea, I'm addicted to your lifestyle
Love junkie and I need to hit you right now
You got that right sound
I can turn these lights down
And play you all night
Girl is that all right
Me, I'm more than alright
I'm the best at what I do that sound like your type
And girl I'm on you like I'm white and you're rice
Sound complicated big girl you got me faded
You on fire baby I can ash you
And Imma face it no never pass you
You know I love the way that ass move
You can tell them you wit me if they ask boo
Keep it strummin', I, I keep it comin'
Why I keep you comin', beat it like a drumma
Eat it like a glutton we done got into something
I need it I need it I want it

(Hook:K-Young)

You remind me of the fire in my gun and
Kinda like my guitar the way ya body be strumming
Ooohh keep it coming cause I'm in need of yaaa

Your sex, drugs and rock n roll
Like oooohhh (I need it, I need it, I need it baby)
Your sex, drugs and rock n roll
Oooohhh (I need it, I need it, I need it baby)

(Verse 2:Kid Ink)

Yeah, baby girl I need a fixin'
You keep me rollin' like the sixties
And got me open like its Christmas
You so persistent I can't resist it
Yea she cause it but I can risk it
Death kiss feel the fire in her lipstick
Might be the baddest bitch ever invented
You might not ever see it but god as my witness
I swear he paid attention when he came and made her
Gotta thank the savior for doin' me this favor
Watch out she danger she'll come with a waiver
But I can take her but fate her
Keep it comin', yeah I keep it flowin'
While I keep you comin', beat it like you punished
Eat it like I'm hungry, we done got into somethin
I need it, I need it, I want it

(Hook: K-Young)

You remind me of the fire in my gun and
Kinda like my guitar the way ya body be strumming
Ooohh keep it coming cause I'm in need of yaaa

Your sex, drugs and rock n roll
Like oooohhh (I need it, I need it, I need it baby)
Your sex, drugs and rock n roll
Oooohhh (I need it, I need it, I need it baby)
Your sex, drugs and rock n roll
