[HOOK - Kid Ink]
I ain't got a care in the world tonight
We really ain't worried about nothing
Had a long day all my life
I been waiting for this moment
So I gotta live it up live it up, live it up
Live it up live it up, live it up

Verse 1:
Hold up, let the song play, I live my life the wrong way
Wake up to some Bombay and a bong blazing bomb haze
So every day's a long day, and every night's a grind night
I know that I'mma make it I just gotta get my mind right
This hip hop shit is my life, I'm working towards the limelight
You rappers got no vision always looking like some blind mice
While I'm working hard to rhyme tight, and make my vision hindsight
I don't need a source to cite, I know I'm the Unsigned Hype
Working till I make it and I promise not to give it up
And once I reach my destination, guarantee I live it up
Fill a cup and sip it down, never one to give a fuck
Beat my haters through success, rather than a fisticuff
Told y'all I'mma make it, and I know my dreams are on the way
To becoming a reality, so I'm just saying andale
And waiting on the day. In it for the music not the pay
Though I know it's on the way, and once it comes I gotta say

[HOOK - Kid Ink]

Verse 2:
Working for my goals, bitch I'm doing it the honest way
Exotic haze to start the day, then I'm dropping bars like "Bomb's Away"
No Bobby Ray. I spit it sick but never take a call in day
You're like the team from Philly, you're so quick to take a Holiday
I've been on point, you're new to this, call me Allen Iver-
Son, I'll build it up from nothing then blow up like I'm MacGyver
From the bottom up like a geyser, I'm working like a survivor
It's my destiny, child, and my fan club is the driver
My club is a driver, get it? Bitch, That's poetry
I'm blowing tree and flowing knowing soon people will notice me
This shit is not a joke to me, that's why I flow with potency
Look for an instrumental then I decimate it totally
Killing every beat and leaving all producers grieving
Until I become the leader in this game I will not leave it
I was born to be the savior, the rap game's Jesus
Performing lyrical miracles so even haters will believe it, can't you see it?

[Bridge - Corny]
I never take a day off, I'm starting to see it pay off
My music's sounding better while you're always sounding way off
I'm the mother fucking champion and you ain't in the playoffs
I roll up and I may cough, my life is filled with chaos
Striving for perfection and working to be the greatest
While looking at my reflection so certain I'm gonna make it
Same people up in my section since birth and that isn't changing
My team has got a connection and I want em all saying...
