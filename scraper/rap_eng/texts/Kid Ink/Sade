(Intro: Diddy Talking)

See, sometimes
I just like to get with my chick and check into a hotel
For like two or three days
Where we just don’t even leave the room, ya dig?
And I throw on that Sade
It’s something about that Sade, ya dig?
And you smoking something, drinking something, you know?
Get on yo adult shit
High as a muthafucka
Touch the sky in this muthafucka
See baby, I just wanna chill with you
And listen to this Sade
And make love to you for three days straight…


(Verse 1: Kaleena)

You got me burning like fire
Hotter than a desire
I just wanna get high
Kick it all day
Listening to Sade
Baby, bring it right here
Don’t lie
You be tripping like Ike
Lovers playing so high
It’s hurting my head
Vibrating my bed
Tingling in my leg
Yeah

(Chorus)

I don’t know what to do
My heart burns cold without you
I don’t know what to do
Your love’s got me so confused

(Verse 2: Dawn)

You got me dripping like ice
In the mid of July
What was that that you say?
Wanna kiss it all day?
Listening to Sade
Baby, bring it right here
All right
You been loving my sound
Turn it up, it’s so loud
That it’s hurting my head
I ain’t getting no rest
Boy, I love it, so fresh

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Diddy)

You got me burning like fire
Hotter than a desire
I just wanna get high
Kick it all day
Listening to Sade
Baby, bring it right here
Don’t lie
You be tripping like I
Lovers playing so high
You be hurting my head
Vibrating my bed
Tingling in my leg

(Bridge)

I won’t let you go
You’re my prisoner
Even if you return
I’ll be gone when you get home
(x1)


(Diddy Talking: Outro)

You see
This Dirty Money shit, it ain’t for everybody
It’s a muthafuckin vibe
It’s for muthafuckas that’s patient
It’s for muthafuckas that like to take they time
Close they eyes, and dream
You my dream come true, baby
I love you…
But I really hate you
