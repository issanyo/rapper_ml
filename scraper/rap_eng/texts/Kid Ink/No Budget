[Intro: Kid Ink]
(Bongo turn it up, bongo turn it up)
(Bongo on the way)
Kid Ink
(Murda on the beat, so it’s not nice)

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Run around, bust it
Do it for a budget
Hit that whoa, whoa, whoa
V12 bust it
AP bust it (What?)
Ain’t no budget
Money talk, money talk
End of discussion
Run around, bust it
Do it for a budget
Hit that whoa, whoa, whoa
V12 bust it
AP bust it
Ain’t no budget
Money talk, money talk
End of discussion (Bust it)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Up all night, I’m a bat, shorty fight, she a brat
Went to Fifths, threw a fit, that shit bat, roll a Back
I don’t trip, let ‘em cap, 0-6, bust a lap
Foreign engine like a gat, it go blat, blat, blat
I don’t ever make a move, that ain’t cool for the brand
YSL shoes got me fly as Peter Pan
I just hit her with the D every time she need a Xan
I just hit her with the B when she talkin' ’bout a plan (What she talkin’ ‘bout?)

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Ink]
Lil' bitch, you hot, Fiji drip on the fox
We don’t kiss, we don't talk
That’s your man? That’s a thot
Shit go down like the top, put a crown on the watch
Henney brown on the rocks (Load it up and let it pop)

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Runnin' 'round, bust it
Do it for a budget
Hit that whoa, whoa, whoa
V12 bust it (Whoo)
AP bust it (What?)
Ain’t no budget
Money talk, money talk
End of discussion
Runnin' 'round, bust it (Bust it)
Do it for a budget
Hit that whoa, whoa, whoa
V12 bust it (Ooh)
AP bust it
Ain’t no budget
Money talk, money talk
End of discussion (What)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
AP go on and bust it, end of discussion
Kick her out if she ain’t fuckin’
Count it back and that’s a hundred (Ooh)
That is no rap cap, I bring the trap back
Me and the plug with big racks, I’m flexin’ up like a skier
Eat her, I can’t keep her, fuck her then I leave her
Bentley white like Justin Bieber, ooh, I can’t even believe her, ayy
‘Cause she brought her best friends, I turned ‘em to lesbians
Ooh, fuck her at the Westin, new freezer, I’m bustin'

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Ink]
Lil' bitch, you hot, Fiji drip on the fox
We don’t kiss, we don't talk
That’s your man? That’s a thot
Shit go down like the top, put a crown on the watch
Henney brown on the rocks (Load it up and let it pop)

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Runnin' 'round, bust it
Do it for a budget
Hit that whoa, whoa, whoa
V12 bust it
AP bust it
Ain’t no budget
Money talk, money talk
End of discussion

[Outro: Kid Ink & Rich The Kid]
Bust it, ooh
Bust it, ooh
Lil' bitch, you hot, Fiji drip on the fox
We don’t kiss, we don't talk
That’s your man? That’s a thot
Shit go down like the top, put a crown on the watch
Henney brown on the rocks (Load it up and let it pop)
