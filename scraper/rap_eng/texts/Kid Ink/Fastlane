[Chorus]
I know you see me riding high
Feels like a roller coaster headed to the sky
We rolling speeding like we running out of time
And live the fast life, you could get behind, you could get behind
We in the fast lane and all I see is dolla signs
Cause all I got is money on my mind, right
We in the fast lane, swerving in between the lines
You see 'em hating tell him get behind

[Verse 1]
Might find me posted on the scene, roll up
Burning to the third degree, that O G
You could throw away the leaves, I go in
Like you could throw away the key, I got the world awaiting me
Cause bitch I'm hot, come get a sun stroke
If I say it please don't unquote, got they hands up like a dumb pope
They ring girls just like the front post, put a ransom on the beat
I need that money you want that, beat
Alumni army you best retreat, as fly as I can fucking be
I know you see me riding high, eyes low and I don't think that I can drive
We still up it's 'bout a quarter after 5, live like we won't see the afterlife, I know you see me flying by

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we never slowing up, riding round top down
So you know its us, can't notice much
Cause I'm moving at the speed of light, bad bitch with
Me she ain't gotta be polite, long as she with me tonight
We can get it popping like I'm Orville Redenbacher
Faded of that juice and vodka, if you tryina get intoxicated
Holla at me baby, get you anything you need
It's a hit and run watch me crash the party then I leave
Like vamanos tell them bitches adios
Sick I need a higher dose, fast life die slow
On a rollercoaster headed to the top
Now put your hands in the air cause baby, it's about to drop

[Chorus]
