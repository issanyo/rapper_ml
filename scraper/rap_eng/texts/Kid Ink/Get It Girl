Work hard for the money
She work (hard for the money)

Go on shake that money maker

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Hands on the floor
If you wanna see bands on the floor
Look like a nigga brought a band up in here
And I ain't need no wristband nigga damn
Get it g-g-girl
Let me know that you with it girl
With all that ass can you sit it down
All these ones you ain't gone wanna count
You could take it to the bank
I'm the man in your city
Til a nigga fly out in the AM
Feelin' like I made it
Champagne campaign
I'm bout to tear up the club
We could start a little mayhem
What the fuck is you sayin'
Go on shake that money maker
Work hard for the money
Go on shake that money maker

[Verse 2: Louie Batz]
Look, she uh got her ass in my face
She yo girl but I got her by the waist
Feelin' up on it
Bet she feel a 9 in a second
Maybe 10 how she grindin' up on it
Shit I'm like
Hold up baby, no I need a second
Later maybe we can slip again in the vid
You know what they all say baby
It ain't trickin' if you got it
Then you bout to have it all don't trip
So so, so, so shake that ass
Just roll them hips
Play with that clit
If I pull it out baby you could stroke a bit
If you a real nigga real bitches with the shit
Make your knees touch your nostrils
I'll lick it baby if its sweet though
Just warmin' up before a deep throat
And you can pick up all this money that I'm throwin'
And this liquor that I'm pourin'
But you gotta be a freak ho

[Hook: Kid Ink]

[Verse 2: Hardhead]
P-Put it on the pole
Drop low, wind slow
When I throw that cash
Ass so fat but this liquor hella strong
Think my pill just popped
So I need a lap dance
Grindin' hard like we broke
She twerkin' that pussy
I'm grippin' her waist
Got a flight in two hours
So there's no time to waste
So its no conversation
Just need her to shake that ass
Let these ones keep cummin' like pornstars
Bust it open bae
And preform for em'
Like the intro to [?]
Just work

Get it girl

[Verse 3: Shitty Montana]
Oh, she on the pole for the money
I heard she [?] 10 toes for the money
You know I'm a pimp so she ho for the money
By any means necessary go on get this money
You know I look like money
Smell like money and I walk like money
Ain't shit funny bitch, where my money
Hol up, hol up, hol up, hol up
I'm the type of nigga drop a band on it
Dependin' on what type of ass on it
Gone off the drugs
Imma smash on it
Can't hit it raw
Put a mask on it
For a thot Imma do the whole dance on it
No lay up just slam dunk it
Hop up on the stage
Clap your ass on me
Ayy ayy just
