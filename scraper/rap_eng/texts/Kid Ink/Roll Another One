[Intro:  Shitty Montana]
Yeah
Ayy
Batgang bitch
Batgang bitch

[Hook: Shitty Montana & Kid Ink]
Imma smoke one to the face
Then roll another one
This weed so loud
I love the taste
I rolled another one
And yeah I'm smokin' out the pound
So roll another one
And Imma smoke its gone
And roll another one
Roll another one
Bitch roll another one
This weed so loud
This weed so strong
I rolled another one
Roll another one
Bitch roll another one
We tryna smoke this whole pound
So roll another one

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm high as fuck
And I'm bout to roll another one
Sticky as a honey bun
Its fire
I'm the sun and such
Watch how you hit it too hard
Might suffocate
Somebody come recipitate
Let me help you stimulate your mind
No your blunt ain't nowhere big as mine
I can tell from the taste
What you smoke should be a crime
Break it down but don't get outta line
Piece up
Roll another one
Got two at a time

[Verse 2: Shitty Montana]
Puff puff pass
Nigga hand it my way
Never fuck a rotation
Like Craig on Friday
I copped a pound from my plug
Blew it in five days
And I OG all my bud
No we don't fire hate
I flash yo bitch a ounce
And told her come get high wit me
She wanna sit on cloud 9
She wanna fly wit me
I sprinkle sprinkle her tongue
Now she a molly freak
I mean she molly geek
Pulled the blunt and then ride wit me

[Hook: Shitty Montana & Kid Ink]

[Verse 3: HardHead]
I gets high on the regular
Chain smokin' always
Roll two grams in my swisher
Smoke about a ounce a day
She roll my weed but don't smoke
A pound in my ashtray
Chokin' on Lebron James
Add a little hash in
Roll another 3
OG got my mind fucked
Soon as I light it then pass it
Roll another one
We loaded
Riding cloud 9, 10, and 11
I'm so high right now that I can hear heaven
