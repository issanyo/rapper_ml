[Intro: Kap G]
Why the fuck this bitch texting my phone?
You're not my girlfriend

[Chorus: Kap G]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
You shouldn't have let her out if you don't trust your girlfriend
She say she roll swishas so I let that girl sit
I don't need your bitches 'cause I got my own hoes
Prince of my city and she [?]
Run it up, run it, run it like Jackie Jones
She told me sign her titties and I never folded
I can't lie, that ass curvy like macaroni
I might hit you if she throw it at me, back and forth
By the waitress, keep on bringin' Aces by the cases
Then it's time on the AP, pass it to her, tell her face it, that's your problem
This your night and she gon' never get ignored
Why you mad at me? I ain't even let her in
I ain't even know that's your girlfriend
But I could kill the pussy like I'm Persian
She like the tats on my face like Birdman
Know I stay in my bag, nigga, Birkin

[Chorus: Kap G]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend

[Verse 2: Kap G]
Get out my lane, that's candy paint
Took out the brain, I'm at the flame
We not the same, Louis V frame
Look where I came, from Marta trains
Look at my game, I'm like King James
I'm making movies, just like the Wayans
Fuck what she sayin', she want a ring
Pimpin' ain't easy, Big Daddy Kane
Baby don't even know yo name
Hundred on the dash like I'm Dame
She wanna take trips to Romane
Call me David, I'm the one to blame
I can't even do it, babe, sorry, I can't even lie
Why you tryna fuck with me babe? You got another guy
She said, "Can I come again?" Maybe, girl, another time
Tramp stamp on her back, what is that a butterfly?
Blowin' on the gas from the Amoco
I just hit yo girl in my Polo Pajamas tho
Gotta stay strapped like I'm Rambo tho
And she thick and she pretty (like who?) like Amber Rose

[Chorus: Kap G]
I just took a flick with your girlfriend
I been kickin' shit with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
