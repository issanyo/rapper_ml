[Hook: Kid Ink]
You can tell em I'ma do, what I want
I don’t care about your rules, just can’t lose
I said we ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it, no
We ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it
All I need

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Said I ain’t worried bout a damn thing
Spent 20 grand on this damn chain
And if niggas thinking I’m a damn stain
Put a couple slugs in his damn brain
Cause we always strapped up
We ain’t got to call for back up
Don’t be fooled by this rap stuff
You can get your ass clapped up
Got two 30 clips, and a 50 in the trunk, we ain’t worried bout it
They said it’s in my car, on the scene last week
Three niggas got shot and I ain’t heard about it
Riding round with the pump, niggas still try to front
I done told niggas once, I ain’t taking no lose
Be smooth when you fucking with the bosses
Step up, it’s gon be a lot of coffins, baow baow

[Hook: Kid Ink]
You can tell em I'ma do, what I want
I don’t care about your rules, just can’t lose
I said we ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it, no
We ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it
All I need

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
All I know is get money, nothing else
Niggas better keep their hands to they self
On my mama, if a nigga touch me
Then I promise he won’t touch nobody else
All I need is a coupe and a bad bitch
And a Louie duffel bag with some cash in it
And a stupid ass crib somewhere out in the hills
So whenever I get bored I can crash in it
There’s a lot of bad hoes in my iPhone
Off white on, new mics on
And it’s hot outside, got my ice on
So fresh that I can’t leave the pipe home
All this cash once a young nigga do it
Everything in my pocket, I'ma throw it
If he got his own squad I ain’t going
I ain’t worried bout nothing, bet I do it

[Hook: Kid Ink]
You can tell em I'ma do, what I want
I don’t care about your rules, just can’t lose
I said we ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it, no
We ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it
All I need
