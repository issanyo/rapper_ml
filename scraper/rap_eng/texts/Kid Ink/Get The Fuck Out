[Intro]
Out, said I'ma need you to get the fuck up…
Or, so don’t sit around

[Verse 1]
Ay, what you came for?
Know I came with my niggas and the bank roll
Sorry I ain’t tryna sound like an A-hole
But I don’t need you acting like a stank ho, ay ho
Straight up tryna figure out your angle
It could be the heels fucking up your ankles
Now ain’t nobody mad at you but
Just wanna see that ass on you go
Up, bust it back and forth
With your attitude don’t take it personal
Cash up face down with your purse on the floor
V.I.P. player I’m the person to know

[Hook]
I said
Why you even, out, with an attitude
You know I'm tryna wild, so don't sit around
Don't sit around, or I'ma need you to get out
So don't sit around or I'ma need you to get the fuck out

[Verse 2]
And quit it with the bullshit
Always tryna play it cool whip
When, a nigga wetter than a pool dip
Almost done with the full fifth
You was good at first and then you full flip
I'ma need you to get out
Club going up I don’t need you to sit down
Tryna get high go on pass that shit round
Be, careful when you hit it
And you should drink lesser of that Henney
Let me get champagne for the champions
You ain’t gotta worry about a damn thing
When, you fucking with a nigga
Heavy now she fucking with a nigga
Check my wrist it’s a Rollie on mine
And you could be doing something better with your time

[Hook]
I said
Why you even, out, with an attitude
You know I'm tryna wild, so don't sit around
Don't sit around, or I'ma need you to get out
So don't sit around or I'ma need you to get the fuck out
