[Hook]
I got a problem and I try to tell myself it's something different
But it ain't nothing new I gotta have that, in my system, in my system
I've been fiending for a feeling, if you with it come and dip it
And if you ain't know, I ain't tripping but
I need it in my system, my system, my system, my system
I-I-I don't know (my system) bout-bout-bout you but I need it in my system
My system, my system, my system
I-I-I don't know (my system) bout-bout-bout you but I need it in

[Verse 1]
My car, my swisher, my drugs, my bitches
See 'em pump-ing their fists, man, this feeling is officially in my system
You tripping, we whiling, safari
Probably won't remember much tonight, apologize, I'm sorry

I done had too many sips of this Patr√≥n up in my system
Baby, don't be too pretentious, ain't nobody paying attention
Do your dance, do your dance, just don't drop that thunder, thunder
Fumble, it's okay go ahead and dip your finger in this hando
Got a problem, no denial, keep it real with my addiction
Call me Tim the tool man Tailor if you need a fucking fixer
Puffing loud, hear me now, all you gotta do is listen
Drink strong, man, it feel like I've been lifting, come and get it

[Hook]
Got a problem and I try to tell myself it's something different
But it ain't nothing new, I gotta have that in my system, in my system
I've been fiending for a feeling, if you with it come and dip it
If you ain't know, I ain't tripping but
I need it in my system, my system, my system, my system
I-I-I don't know (my system) bout-bout-bout you but I need it in my system
My system, my system, my system
I-I-I don't know (my system) bout-bout-bout you but I need it in

[Verse 2]
My trunk, my system, the drums, it's kicking
The drugs, it's kicking, I'm drunk, belligerent
You sober, you tripping, somebody get him a cane
I'm with the dream team, drinking on champion shit champagne

Now I done had too many sips of different mixes in my system
All these women in my section, it get hard to pay attention
That's my bad, that's your bad, ain't nobody you could be mad at
A-a-aiming for your melon, every shot automatic
Going crazy in this bitch, like all the walls are padded
Not, in my, right mind but my bitch right at the pageant
T-t-tell her keep on rolling, kush sticky as molasses
See a hole in the swisher, don't worry, baby, I'll patch it

[Hook]
Got a problem and I try to tell myself it's something different
But it ain't nothing new, I gotta have it in my system, in my system
I've been fiending for a feeling, if you with it come and dip it
If you ain't know, I ain't tripping but
I need it in my system, my system, my system, my system
I don't know about you but I need it in my system
My system, my system, my system
I don't know (my system) about you but

My system, my system, my system
My system, my system, my system, my system....
