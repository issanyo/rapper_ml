[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah, yeah, uh

[Chorus: J. Valentine]
I'm speeding on the freeway tryna get home
Pushing it to the max, she can't wait that long
Feel like I'm gonna crash and burn
I hit my last turn, but she already let my hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Feel like just a week ago we were so equal
Where we get divided, my time is for me though
Wish that I could repo your love and sew up your heart
I see you hurting from the pain, I shoulda known from the start
But now I'm speeding, leaning, pedal to the metal
I got my reasons but all they worth finna losing you forever no
I'm down girl, knee deep
In between the lines, tell me can you read this
Issues on top of issues
Better leave them in the rear view, baby it's official
I need you on my side, by my side like a pistol
So baby girl don't leave me, bring that back, replay

[Chorus: J. Valentine]
I'm speeding on the freeway tryna get home
Pushing it to the max, she can't wait that long
Feel like I'm gonna crash and burn
I hit my last turn, but she already let my hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Go, why you let me go?
Really needed you there, shoulda let me know
Uh, coulda let it show, no reason to be insecure
Swear I got everything you need but you tell me you still need more
So now I'm swerving, far away from perfect
Then you pay attention and tell me it was worth it, worth this
I got my foot to where the gas
Tryna make it fast, we gotta make it last, uh

[Bridge: J. Valentine]
Baby I don't know how we ended up, never thought we'd end up this way
Can't eat, can't sleep, nobody coulda told me there would come a day
That you don't love me, you don't care
I'll be turning over, you won't be there

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Gone, can't believe she gone
It didn't seem that long, but now we all alone
Musta made a wrong turn somewhere, tell you where it is but you heard something else
He say, she say, CA

[Chorus: J. Valentine]
I'm speeding on the freeway tryna get home
Pushing it to the max, she can't wait that long
Feel like I'm gonna crash and burn
I hit my last turn, but she already let my hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control, let me hands go like
Cruise control
