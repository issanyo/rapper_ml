[Hook]
Lights out, hit the switch when ain't nobody lookin'
I ain't trippin', that's just how you took it
Gettin' high, that help my aggravations
This elevation feel so damn amazing
Young nigga hang out the broads
Know that you hear when it's on
We made it out this far
The way I been actin', I'm sorry
Young nigga hang out the waters
Young nigga hang out the run
Hit the switch
And then I'm blackin' out

[Verse 1]
I might black out
I got that power packed in here like pack out
Got through security without no pat down
I tip 100 and then I tilt my head down
You see me, you should know who I got in the background
If they run it up, I just took my lap round
I just took my first one, but it's not my last one
She told me to pass one, alley-oop it, and one
I know just what you want
From that dress that you want
AC got you cold
And Hennessy get you on
Some of you niggas are hot for the summer
Rest of the year, you not for discussion
My money talkin', I'm up for discussin'
She love when I thump it, I thump it, I thump it, I thump it
I put the key in ignition
You hear that bitch hummin'
I hit the corner and pull up
You ain't seen it comin'

[Hook]
Lights out, hit the switch when ain't nobody lookin'
I ain't trippin', that's just how you took it
Gettin' high, that help my aggravations
This elevation feel so damn amazing
Young nigga hang out the broads
Know that you hear when it's on
We made it out this far
The way I been actin', I'm sorry
Hit the switch
And then I'm blackin' out

[Verse 2]
We blackin' out
Know we in the building and it's packin' out
All them old hoes give me action now
Hit it from the back until the track is out
I know where I'm goin', you ain't gotta map it out
Sittin' on top of the hills, made it out the south
Central of LA, murder was the case
I got up out the hood, without a beat from Dre
No cosign and no verse from Snoop
Eminem my hair, treat all my niggas like proof
We beat the odds and I'm livin' poof
You told me that my dreams were lies, I'll forgive you soon
Ask, I start to lose my hunger and then, I just remember
All of the hamburgers that I had for dinner
Nigga, the game that we playin' is not for beginners
I see you been tryin' to shine but everything gettin' dimmer

[Outro]
Lights out
