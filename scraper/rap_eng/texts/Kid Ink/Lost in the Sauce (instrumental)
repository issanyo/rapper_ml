Man I hear these niggas talk
When I see em but they don't really say it all
But we ain't really feelin yall
Anyway man I swear that they fuckin lost
Lost, in the sauce
They fuckin lost, lost in the sauce
They fuckin lost, lost
And I been tryna play it off
But somebody needs to tell em who they really are

And tell em what I'm really bout
From the bottom nobody there to dig me out
All these gold diggin hoes on a nigga now
Tell her take it to the floor baby sit it down
Way before the rap nigga
I would barely wave to these whack niggas
But now I see em all with they hands out
Like a diver, I let em all drown
(Egh)
I'm yellin out
Reportin live somewhere on a cloud
World wide but these niggas know I'm west bound
Everybody takin shots lemme get a round
Talkin shit I'll plunge a muhfucka
At the top come bungie with a muhfucka
Up all night fuck who the rest is
Bet your girlfriend know who the best is

Man I hear these niggas talk
When I see em but they don't really say it all
But we ain't really feelin yall
Anyway man I swear that they fuckin lost
Lost, in the sauce
They fuckin lost, lost in the sauce
They fuckin lost, lost
And I been tryna play it off
But somebody needs to tell em who they really are

They come and try to tell me that its hype now
Hollywood they ain't ready for my lifestyle
Money talk I don't care how it might sound
Put your ears to the ground hear me comin down, like a stampede
Live the fast life, of a celebrity
These niggas ain't won shit why they celebratin
On a whole nother level on the elevator
Got em lookin to the sky see me high up
Finally everything I desired
Is in my hands, seen so many niggas lose it
Over this bullshit
No aim shootin for the stars with a full clip
Now they tryna get they hands in my pot
Lost in the sauce meatball problems
Swear I can't take no more of the nonsense
Tell em that I'm ready for the consequence, bitch

Man I hear these niggas talk
When I see em but they don't really say it all
But we ain't really feelin yall
Anyway man I swear that they fuckin lost
Lost, in the sauce
They fuckin lost, lost in the sauce
They fuckin lost, lost
And I been tryna play it off
But somebody needs to tell em who they really are
