[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Man, I been on the road
Walking in the room like it's (?)
I fell in love with a Trap Queen yeah, and a pocket full of Fetty
You know her ass skinny like (?), You know a nigga sick and need a medic
Before I give her all my children let her hit the blunt until she dumb like Kelly
Booked that bitch a ticket let her carry on, Don Juan with a cup on Dom Perignon
And a baseball bat blunt Barry Bonds, smoke that bitch down till the cherry gone
Pussy ass niggas how that cherry taste? Heard about the beef let it marinate
Hear them try'na tell my story let them narrate say you getting money but I think I know a better way

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I been I been, yeah
I been, I been
I been 'round the world nigga
I done probably been with your girl nigga
I been I been, yeah

I been through the hood nigga, yeah
I been doing good nigga

[Verse 2: Vee Tha Rula]
I been in the hood, rolling big cigars like we should
About to hit up Munich, rhinos every Sunday watch me do it
Give her dick down low she compute and let her look me up on Google then she suck me slightly stupid ooh
The money all that matter, when you try'na get Ghosts and them Phantoms
Gotta keep the weak lit like a candle bad bitch on the piano lay my dick on her enamel
You cross me it'll be a dark day, check my forehead that's why they call my Scarface
You a little fucking fish nigga shark bait, I like the spicy calamari with the parsley
Nigga you don't got dinero nigga poor cake, nigga I don't fear shit but a court date

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I been I been, yeah
I been, I been
I been 'round the world nigga
I done probably been with your girl nigga
I been I been, yeah
I been I been, yeah
I been through the hood nigga, yeah

[Bridge: Kid Ink]

You know I been I been

[Verse 3: Hardhead]
I been on the edge nigga, so here's a toast to my team for burning bread nigga
Chasing blue faces like I'm Gargamel, just some dirty ass kids no garbage pail
Been around the world baby globe trotting, back home niggas hating hoes still plotting
Bag full of pills no dope boy shopping in London $3500 for the coat boy
I been on the red eye, how I book a bitch a ticket no bread? Use my air miles
I been yelling out fuck them all, 4th down either hail Mary pass bitch or punt the ball
I been riding in Aventadors, all eyes on me Pac shit when we hit the door
We made a killing but we getting more, and if that starts to slow up it's mask down come to getting yours

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I been I been, yeah
I been, I been
I been 'round the world nigga
I done probably been with your girl nigga
I been I been, yeah
I been I been, yeah
I been through the hood nigga, yeah
I been doing good nigga
