Fuego-go-go-go-go
(DJ Mustard speaking)

[Verse 1: Ty$]
I got all this money bout to leave with all these bitches
Tell that bitch
She can have all these hundreds but I wanna see some ass and some titties
Make that shit bounce, turn a young nigga up
Pop one of these and wash it down how you like me now
Rose bottoms up, in VIP smoking up a cloud

[Hook]
Tell me what the fuck you gon' do
With a young nigga like me
Nigga with so much dough
White tee in a Bentley
I know what your bitch gon' do
Soon as she sees me
She gon' drop it low, she gon' pick it up
She gon' back it up right here on me

[Hook]
I'mma knock it down like I'm hittin free throws
And I'm gettin money like I'm playing for the pros
She used to the rookies but I'mma all star all star
Throwin hundreds out the sports car sports car
All out all out all out all out all out all out woah
All out all out all out all out all out all out it Pushaz Ink* baby

[Verse 2: Ty$]
I drunk all this rose bout to get started on this Cliquot
Tell that bitch
I got more peso than Jose, now ven aqui chupa mi pito
Rapido
Turn a young nigga up, baby don't trip its just drugs
Now girl lets bump and I ain't talkin bout the dance
I'm talkin bout gettin fucked up

[Hook & Hook]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
It's Kid Ink baby
And I'm right on time
B-ball out like I stepped on the line
I should get a ticket bitches tell me I'm fine
All Star team, me and my nigga Ty
I said it smell like money, nose like Pippen
So high I could dunk on Blake Griffin
Rose honey I don't care what you sipping
Stacks so thick, Shaq couldn't grip it (egh)
Go in, and I got enough for all of your friends
Back to the crib, do it all again
Feeling so fly I'm way above the rim
And I see that you want it
But your man in the way like a goalie
We ain't getting no sleep till the morning
Take flight, warning, cause baby it's going, going

[Hook]
