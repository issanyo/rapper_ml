[Intro: Kid Ink]
Okay
One big chain but it feel like 2 doe
Big ass whip, they don't make it in a two-door
Two big blunts to the head like a tumor
Steady laughing to the bank
Bitch I got a lot of humor

[Hook: Kid Ink]
See you gassed up, don't be a hype beast
I look around, niggas dressed just like me
I pull the same hoes in a white tee
Shine bright, diamonds need a fucking ice tray

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Eyesight gone, I'm a fuckin' liability
Life's been a bitch since I took that ho's virginity
I lost my emotions, can't find sympathy
High off life and can't nobody intervene
Bitch I'm blowing up like AP Chemistry
Feels like a menace since I went in on my enemies
Never gave a fuck 'bout a sucka nigga anyway
That heater on the dresser, still trynna find my inner peace
Now you don't wanna see me unleash my inner beast
R.I.P. the club in loving memory
Wake up in the morning and I can't remember anything
Probably shouldn't have drank with my stomach so empty
Shit I'm wilding, see it in my face
See the keys if it drop you should get up out the way
Man I'm sitting on the world looking into outer space
Sitting around you squares got me feeling outta shape
It's Alumni bitch, know I repping to the grave
ATM pull the pin out like the grenade
And money rain all on that ass like a bidet
This Bat Gang bang, got them throwing up that OK
All up in your face, in your face like ol√©
I'm just getting started but the game is fucking OV
Hit you with that fire baby, right off up the stove top
Meet me at the Shell, Mobil or the Chevron, bitch I

[Hook]
See you gassed up, don't be a hype beast
I look around, niggas dressed just like me
I pull the same hoes in a white tee
Shine bright, diamonds need a fucking ice tray

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I said it's Rocketshipshawty, Kid Ink baby, K.I
Call me by my name but don't call me in the daytime
I don't really skate but I got these bitches in line
Know you niggas thought I would've changed when the deal signed
Up all night, take a look into my pale eyes
Gotta keep it G till my mothafuckin' demise
Whip it, whip it hard, can't park this ho
'Bout to buy a crib big as a department store
I ain't scared of nobody and I don't know no other way
Them dudes you with is nobody's, we shutting down the VIP
Table full of baddies bunch of Rihanna's and Beyonce's
Nigga played his cards right, all I got is ace of spades
'Bout to hit a homerun, bases loaded, safe to say
I been fuckin' on one, you just finally seen today

Gassed up, gassed gassed up
