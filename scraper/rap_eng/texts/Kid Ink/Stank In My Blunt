[Intro]
Yeah
Break down, roll up
Roll up

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I break down, roll up
Snake size, Cobra
Swisher sweet, two cups of lean
Just popped off no soda
What you smoke it's so-so
Might pass it off like, "So what?"
These scrub niggas get no love
Wrap it up, toga
OG only
Smell that Folgers
I will never change like the money in your sofa
We smokin' everyday in a loca-motive
Drop-top, choo-choo
With your girlfriend going coo-coo
Everybody know me. Wizard of that OZ
Say they smoking grade A, but all these niggas is phony
Is six heads too fat?
Blunts, call it flowtree
Bonfire, shit going
Round burning so slowly

[HOOK:]
Girl to keep it real, I don't trust nobody
Way you roll it up, damn I need you
Shawty break it down, she don't waste no time
You the type of one I gotta keep
(I love it when you...)

I love it when you roll it, love it when you roll it
Roll it up on me. I love it when you roll it
Love it when you roll it
Roll it

I got this stank in my blunt
(Oh yeah...)
I got this stank in my blunt
(Blunt...)
You smell the stank in my blunt
(Yeah...)
(Blunt...blunt)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I break down, roll up
So California
Palm trees, bomb weed
C4, blow it up
Hippie high, loud smoke
Hear me out, pound for
Pound like a boxer
We twisted like lockers
I'm on one, your girlfriend is on me
We kick it like shown up
She's so high and horny
Just meet me backstage when I get done performing
I got an OZ, I need you to show me how you do it girl

[Bridge]
Show me how you do it girl
(Hah)
Show me how you do it girl
(Yeah)
Show me how you do it girl
(Hah)
Show me how you do it girl

[HOOK]
Girl to keep it real, I don't trust nobody
Way you roll it up, damn I need you
Shawty break it down, she don't waste no time
You the type of one I gotta keep
(I love it when you...)

I love it when you roll it, love it when you roll it
Roll it up on me. I love it when you roll it
Love it when you roll it
(Go...)
Roll it
