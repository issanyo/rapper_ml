[Intro: DeJ Loaf]
(Mustard on the beat, ho)
You ain't got no will, you ain't got no bottle
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
You ain't got no cash, you ain't got no dollas
You stay with that drama, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, just keep it real with ya
You the only nigga here feeling yourself
Walk in, them bitches start filming
They sittin' with a man, thotty ass still grinnin', it's on
Honest, so hot, mind on a comet
Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic
I don’t give a fuck bitch, with or without a condom
Fat Joe, pockets lean back like a recliner
I'm in this, representin' West Side
Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Bat Gang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin
Sipping P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants
On the real

[Pre-Hook: Kid Ink]
You, you call anyone you want
I'ma kill 'em all, bet it on (Let's just be honest)
Said we the only ones that stuntin' now
Let's just be real

[Hook: DeJ Loaf & Kid Ink]
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Yeah let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, we all know the deal
So let's just be honest, let's just be real

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Uh, slow down babe
It’s enough, to go ‘round baby
Been drinkin' like you thirsty
How you make it to my section in the first place?
Nah, I ain't trippin', shit is nada
They say it ain’t trickin' if you got it
Bitch I'm a boss like Gotti
Rock Tom Ford and I still pop Molly
Roll up good Cali, la di da di
It's just me and all my homies
At your door like The Shining, egh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga
Uh and the bitch that I'm with know she hot stuff
Pull up in the Hot Wheels, ballin'  get yo hops up
If you got a problem get a hotline
9-1-1 but we don't ever call the cops, for real

[Pre-Hook: Kid Ink]
You, you call anyone you want
I'ma kill 'em all, bet it on (Let's just be honest)
Said we the only ones that stuntin' now
Let's just be real

[Hook: DeJ Loaf & Kid Ink]
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Yeah let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, we all know the deal
So let's just be honest, let's just be, let's just be real

[Outro: Dej Loaf]
Let's just be
L-let's just be
Let's just be
Let's just be real
Let's just be
