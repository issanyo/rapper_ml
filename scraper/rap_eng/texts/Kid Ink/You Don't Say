[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah
Yeah
Woo woo
You don't say
You don't say
You don't say
You don't say

[Verse 1: Juliann Alexander]
I just can't fuck with some people like I used to
Stunting on my ex bitch, had to take my shit back like T.I did New New
They don't wanna help you when you down
But as soon as you up, they come back around
With their hand out, looking for a handout
She like, you ain't gotta fit in 'cause you stand out
Oh, you don't say
Got a bad lil bitch like 'Yonc√©
Straight to the pussy, no foreplay
And she brought her girlfriend, she go both ways
The hate so real, but the love fake
Been killing these niggas since always
When you shine, make a nigga wanna throw shade
If you leave me then you downgrade
Everything I do I keep it on the low
Already know how the shit go
I ain't really gotta prove shit to a single soul
Money adding up, you haters going broke
All over Europe with the Batgang
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat that gang
Came through twenty deep like Wu-Tang
Talking about me, nigga who changed?
Real niggas don't stay the same
Fake niggas, they gon' switch up
She got D'usse in her cup
You know she finna act up
We all up on Play House, bottles on bottles, damn this lit
You ain't gotta remind nigga, I know I'm the shit

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Said you ain't gotta gas me, no propane
I'm so high now, ain't nothing lowkey
If it ain't about the check don't approach me
Runnin' outta time on the Rolly
Fuck the world, fuck your bitch, raw nigga like [?]
You don't say
You don't say
You don't say
You don't say
No foreplay, I'm fucking talking now
Nigga all this cheese, I'm ready for the cameras
I'm such a cool motherfucker, got a rude ass bitch, she the baddest
She got her face from LA, and her ass from Atlanta (Damn)
Pass that shit to the left, hand it, while I one more shot from the cannon
Oh na na right now I'm not the nigga that you should be playing with
You don't say
You don't say
Mo money mo problems, then a nigga bill up like [?]
You don't say
You don't say
It's no way, a nigga like me there, if there's no play
You're so late, I do it big and you motherfuckers lowercase
No handshake you get a dab my nigga
Roll up to the dealer say crap my nigga

[Outro: Juliann]
Woah
