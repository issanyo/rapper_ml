Fuck
Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, they don't make no sense
Tried to tell you before not to lose yourself
Don't you worry I'll be here when there's no one left
Tell you what it is, everybody ain't a friend
Watch them change like a pen, I'll be here when there's no one left
Put your mind in the game, caught up in what they sayin
You forgot about the plan
Tried to tell you not to lose yourself

Uh, sitting back, talking to myself
Been a long way around like Buddha's belt
Remember when, these lames wouldn't fuck with me
Track star, now they all tryin' to run with me
Friend or foe, you never know
It's a blind game, do you know where you're going
Get your mind right, and leave the left overs
Got the weight of an entire team on my shoulders
So I showed them I'm everything the world made
Tryin' to get paid, blow up like the World Trade, please
Don't you get it twisted like a whirlwind
I will never change, never change 'till the fucking end
True TV, all these niggas so pretending in your face
Complimenting when they really know they spend every day
Talking shit yeah it smells like a mouthful
Hotter that I get these niggas, colder than the South Pole, damn

Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, they don't make no sense
Tried to tell you before not to lose yourself
Don't you worry I'll be here when there's no one left
Tell you what it is, everybody ain't a friend
Watch them change like a pen, I'll be here when there's no one left
Put your mind in the game, caught up in what they sayin
You forgot about the plan
Tried to tell you not to lose yourself

What's happenin', can you tell me what happened?
Is it fame over passion, seem a little distracted
In a couple situations you ain't used too now
Now look around pay attention it ain't no discounts
These niggas is selling souls for their name on a cloud
Don't you worry about me, bitch I came for the doubt
I'm so concrete two feet to the ground
About to fuck shit up but I came into town
Think you need to slow it down
Tryin' to run shit
Lost in the sauce
Get a compass
High off life
Barely even conscious
Livin' in a dream
You forgot what it means to not have a thing
From a block full of fiends
These streets are a monster, Happy Halloween
Hear 'em knocking at your door with a mask on
Feeling like this life isn't everything you asked for, damn

Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, they don't make no sense
Tried to tell you before not to lose yourself
Don't you worry I'll be here when there's no one left
Tell you what it is, everybody ain't a friend
Watch them change like a pen, I'll be here when there's no one left
Put your mind in the game, caught up in what they sayin
You forgot about the plan
Tried to tell you not to lose yourself

Yeah
Uh
I say you fucking with the man now
Yeah
Yeah
Must've forgoten 'bout the plan now
Uh
Somebody tell 'em
Uh
