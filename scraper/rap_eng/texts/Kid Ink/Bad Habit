[Verse 1]
I know we haven't really talked
And we don't always get along
But you got what I like, you got what I like
I know you got choices all in your DM
Brand new niggas tryna be a new friend
But I got what you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Until you find some brand new
Gotta stick to what you used to
Girl you know I'm calling for you
Pull up, you know imma come thru
Until you find some new
No, no, nothing wrong
We're doing what we do what we use to, babe
I got what you like

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you my bad habit
But you know I ain't mad at it
'Cause can nobody love you, babe
Do you like I do you, babe
'Cause baby you my bad habit
You know I ain't mad at it
'Cause can nobody love you, babe

[Verse 2]
You might let them take you out
But you still come home and get me with they waited for
Me what they paying for
'Cause I know your body
You just talking to them 'cause baby, I'm not around
Baby I'm out of town
I know we got differences
But we agree on this everytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Until you find some brand new
Gotta stick to what you used to
Girl you know I'm calling for you
Pull up, you know imma come thru
Until you find some new
No, no, nothing wrong
We're doing what we do what we use to, babe
I got what you like

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you my bad habit
But you know I ain't mad at it
'Cause can nobody love you, babe
Do you like I do you, babe
'Cause baby you my bad habit
You know I ain't mad at it
'Cause can nobody love you, babe

[Outro]
Woo, yeah
Ah, ah
Oh yeah, woo
Until you find some...
