[Intro: Kid Ink & Jonn Hart]
Yeah, Ok

[Bridge: Jonn Hart]
Have you dripping like rain girl
You ain't even tripping got a man girl
Cause I be straight hittin' in the paint girl
Does my thang
I ain't gon' play no games

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide

[Verse 1: Jonn Hart]
Ooh, how you get it so Gucci?
Stevie J. face like oowee
Eat that thang up like sushi
He don't have to go down he Boosie
I can make it slip
I can make it slide
I'mma get it wet, he gon' leave it dry
Swimming in the pool, let a nigga dive
Little mama lookin' like she puttin' 95
And when I slide in, thr-throw it right back
Your man ain't me he ain't goin' like that
I do it so good shorty begging me to smack
Jumpin' head first, I'mma make a splash

[Bridge: Jonn Hart]
Have you dripping like rain girl
You ain't even tripping got a man girl
Cause I be straight hittin' in the paint girl
Does my thang
I ain't gon' play no games

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Now I can make it slip, and slide
Get you wet one sip, at a time
Now shawty wanna dip, in the ride
Talkin' to her like a pimp, but I tell ya no lie
Baby girl you the truth, soon as you wake up
Hollywood face with an ass from Decatuer
Bay attitude little New York flavor
Everything to me, gon' show me what ya made of
I see you over there with your BF
Lesbi-honest no secrets
I got a seat wet, mean I got a seat sex, mean I got a seat less
See you at the exit

[Bridge: Jonn Hart]
Have you dripping like rain girl
You ain't even tripping got a man girl
Cause I be straight hittin' in the paint girl
Does my thang
I ain't gon' play no games

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide

[Verse 3: Jonn Hart]
Me and you girl, in my room girl
You know what we gon do (gon do)
Grabbin' on my pillow, its bout' 4 in the morn
And we home all alone
I'll make you drip all night long

[Bridge: Jonn Hart]
Have you dripping like rain girl
You ain't even tripping got a man girl
Cause I be straight hittin' in the paint girl
Does my thang
I ain't gon' play no games

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
