[Post-Chorus]
Might just trip
Is she had enough
Then take your side
And fight one for you
We like the strip
Slay the blunt
Made of mine
Now she loyal

[Verse 1]
Hang around all my fokes’
Cool with my all bro’s
She got all the codes
Sing how I get my dough
She know they board
Said my probs
So I ain’t never gotta share mine
Ain’t no prob’ let it show
With my chain, let it glow
And shine
Cop that his and hers for the time (ahh)

[Chorus]
Don’t gotta keep no tabs
Send her to get the bags
I just got to ask
Is that your girl?
That’s your chick
She don’t hold me I might just trip
Hold shit down
That’s so chill
Know the story, I’m not gon’ tell
Might fuck up and wants you to fail
She don’t want you to write no poems
Get her to the room and write them all

[Post-Chorus]
Might just trip
Is she had enough
Then take your side
And fight one for you
We like the strip
Slay the blunt
Made of mine
Now she loyal

[Bridge]
Yeah
Gotta show you some respect
Celebrating with my whip
I pull up and hit the deck
Yeah
Give me more and nothing less
Ain’t no question know what’s next
I roll up she pass the test

[Verse 2]
Made of mine (ya)
Help turn me from a k9
Hit the Molly tell her lose her mind
Chanel just came out with that new design
I said
That’s just what she has for me
Shawty ride or die me
Remind me of my Chevrolet
Ain’t never been scared
Might kick a bitch like Kevin gates (ahh)

[Chorus]
Don’t gotta keep no tabs
Send her to get the bags
I just got to ask
Is that your girl?
That’s your chick
She don’t hold me I might just trip
Hold shit down
That’s so chill
Know the story, I’m not gon’ tell
Might fuck up and wants you to fail
She don’t want you to write no poems
Get her to the room and write them all

[Post-Chorus]
Might just trip
Is she had enough
Then take your side
And fight one for you
We like the strip
Slay the blunt
Made of mine
Now she loyal
