[Hook: Kid Ink]
You know how we shut it down (down)
The city doesn't matter
We be gettin' to it automatic (skrrrt)
I know you hear me comin' down (down)
Everybody wake up
My wait up
I think I'm tryna waste it
Tell em' that its goin' down
Its goin' down, its goin' down
Goin' down, its goin' down
Its goin' down

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Gettin' money that's all we know
Paul Wall, Kid Ink
Gettin' money that's all we know
Bitch I stay gettin' bank
I'm steamin'
All day I hustle
I think I invented the meaning
Tho'd off of that drank, I'm leanin'
Five racks on footwear and Nordstrom's and [?]
Every month, 8 cars I [?]
I work for it, I got it
Now my pockets fat like Sherman Klump
Don't sherm the blunt
Way too drunk, I made the punks
Gotta line pole and Hawaiian Punch
You mad but I'm not trippin'
I'm just trippy off them OG blunts
I got more syrup in my cup than on your waffles bro
Leanin' like a quarter to 4
I got more paper in my pocket than your office bro
Gettin' money that's all we know
Gettin' money that's all we know

Tell em' that its goin' down
Its goin' down, its goin' down
Goin' down, its goin' down
Its goin' down
Gettin' money that's all we know
Gettin' money that's all we know
Gettin' money that's all we know

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Okay, I know you might see me with my shawty
But you don't want the drama
My bitch would terminate that ass
Just like Sarah Connor
Take a look into my bank account
All you see is commas
And this, and that
One after another
Got a pocket full of that flubber
Attitude like fuck it
All the bullshit I done suffered
Might, sucker punch a sucker
Never been one bout records but my patience gettin' rusty
Its west side, the H-town
The blunts stank so much they good
Quarterback of my team but
Don't ever try to rush me
Hear em' hate
Tell em' keep it on the hush because
I ain't wanna hear nothin' if you ain't talkin' bout money
You could tell that I'm on one
The champagne keep on comin'
No question

Goin' down, its goin' down

Gettin' money that's all we know
Gettin' money that's all we know
Gettin' money that's all we know

[Verse 3: Sean Brown]
You know how I shut it down
I be runnin' thru your town
When I be up on the stage
They be screamin' "Sean Brown"
Now you know, original
Can't catch me cuz I'm after my dough
Gotta make my bank account
With at least a few more zeros
M-Multiply, stack them racks
No fucks given, that's how I act
When they try to bring me down
I be like, nigga you don't know how I get around
I'm sick wit it
Call a matic
Call these fake faces cosmetic
She heard about me
First she was sour
Now she sweet like a diabetic
That's that fake shit I don't like
Hang around and steal my light
This ain't no hobby, this my life
So I suggest stay out of sight
If you wasn't with me
Thru my coldest coldest coldest coldest nights
You ain't gone be with me
When I'm takin' takin' takin' flight
Sean Brown

[Outro]
Know, know, that's all we know
Know, know, gettin' money, that's all we know
Know, know, gettin' money, that's all we know
Throwin' dough that's all we know
