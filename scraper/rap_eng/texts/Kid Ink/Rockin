[Intro]
Uh

[Chorus]
I'm rocking, I'm rocking, I'm rocking, I'm rocking
Rocking, rocking, rocking, uh
Let me show you how to do this
Uh, uh, let me show you how to do this

[Verse 1]
Watch how I do this
Come and let me show you how to turn it to a movie, it's yours truly
Tell the DJ keep it spinning like a smoothie man
Can't nobody touch me, got the motherfucking cooties uh
Sitting on the edge like Cali
If it ain't 'bout money then I'm AA outie
Got a flow so dumb, all these niggas looking stupid
Yeah welcome to the jungle bitch I'm wilding on this new shit

[Chorus]
I'm rocking, I'm rocking, I'm rocking, uh got no other option
But to get it, got it, I'm rocking, come and hop up on my rocket and we can take off
Let me show you how to do this
Uh, uh, let me show you how to do this

[Verse 2]
Reporting live from the motherfucking west side
Stay burning down like left eye
Tats on tats, no I never had a desk job
But I'm full screen on your girlfriend desktop
HDP80 see me clearly
Got it smoking like a chimney, 'til my eyes got hickies
Need a fix, no girl I ain't talking 'bout a tool kit
Speakers going HAM, I get it popping on this new shit

[Chorus]
I'm rocking, I'm rocking, I'm rocking, I'm rocking
Rocking, rocking, rocking, uh
Let me show you how to do this
Uh, uh, let me show you how to do this

[Verse 3]
I'm talking big shit, Caps Law, say you bad girl, lemme see you act up
I'm on my new shit, you niggas backed up, got the whole club looking like a crack spot
She watching, I got this, don't worry, we gon' get it popping
No stopping, 'til the morning, you want it? I could put you on this new shit

[Chorus]
I'm rocking, I'm rocking, I'm rocking, I'm rocking
Rocking, rocking, rocking, uh
Let me show you how to do this
Uh, uh, let me show you how to do this
