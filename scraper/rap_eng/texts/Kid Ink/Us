[Chorus: Elley Duhé]
We hold it in our hands
Everything we will become
We hold it in our hands
The hustle, the struggle, the love
That is what makes us us
That is what makes us us
(Kid Ink)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Now whoever thought at 16 this big dreams would turn up like [?]
My peak is still pending
Made it through all of the envy, little injury
Going full speed like Indy, the grind's never ending
Gotta make sure that you feel me before my time's up
We gon' rise busting through the ceiling
I've been trying to play the game just like six rings
If you could only see the drama that this shit brings
Looking for the light trying to feel the beam
Rushed to sellout but it just seems sus
I came from the dust, this is better than nothing
But still ain't enough though
Can't be caught up soft like a plush doll
It'll be straight, yeah I've been brushed off
No love lost, you'll never hear me fuss
And that is what makes us us

[Chorus: Elley Duhé]
We hold it in our hands
Everything we will become
We hold it in our hands
The hustle, the struggle, the love
That is what makes us us
That is what makes us us

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Said ain't no turning back from here
Try to back me in, might crack your chin yeah
I got another lap to win
And big shoes to fill that only Shaq could fill yeah
No I ain't feeling that fulfilled
Said it's back to drills, drip blood, and spills sweat
I don't care how long it take me
And I just laugh at the ones who said they made me
Go ahead try your best but you can't clone
Put your under pressure that'll break bones
Keep my head way to the sky
There ain't no looking down
On the way to the top
Throw it up, let it drop
Did that shit with finesse
Need that championship ring with them big ass baguettes
I know we'll pull through in the clutch
And that's just what makes us us

[Chorus: Elley Duhé]
We hold it in our hands
Everything we will become
We hold it in our hands
The hustle, the struggle, the love
That is what makes us us
That is what makes us us

[Bridge: Elley Duhé]
Is it cliché to say that I
Want this so bad I could taste it
And it just tastes so amazing
Oh I've got the scars to prove that I
Been put through the ringer but I'm coming up greater
I've got the scars to prove that I
Been put through the ringer but I'm coming up greater

[Outro: Elley Duhé]
That is what makes us us
That is what makes us us
That is what makes us us
That is what makes us us
