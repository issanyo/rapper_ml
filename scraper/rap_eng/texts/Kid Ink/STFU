They say I'm this, and they say I'm that
They won't give me a chance no
But I do what I want, I'mma grown ass man
Giving all that I can
Please shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Please shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up

[Verse1-Pries]
They say stop, I say no
They say Pries, please don't go
Well what if I die they night they shot
How many lives do I got?
What's the prize for this prize that I won't hide? can I fly?
Let me saw through the straw for re ensure through my raw
Raw, raw, can't you see my claws ?
I'm laughing at these vermin while I kill it, ha, ha
They blog on they blogs but I don't see it, Ray Charles
I hate the way we live today so I'll see you tomorrow
But if I make it, know we made it, yes I made it just for us
Just for us, time's is rough can't afford no plane so don't miss this bus
Miss this bus if you miss this bus, I got my seat, I won't get up
I'm on some Rose Park shit so sit down & shut the fuck up..

[Verse2-Pries]
They say this, they say that
They say Pries, please don't rap
Stay in school, it ain't you
That I would never get my chance
Fuck my past, I had a plan
Now they mad of how I stand
I was broke, this is true
I had never saw what could I lose
Look at me now, look at me now
Tell me can they feel me now?
Can they see what I dreamed about ?
I'm just trying to make them all fucking proud
In my town, in my circle, result, no fumble
I can't let this chance pass, understand, i'll stay humble
When I make it, know we made it, yes I made it just for us
Just for us, time's is rough can't afford no plane so don't miss this bus
Miss this bus if you miss this bus, I got my seat, I won't get up
I'm on some Rosa Park shit so sit down & shut the fuck up..
