[Hook]
Faster, faster, faster, faster

[Verse 1]
Say you wanna live faster, faster, I got what you asked for
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
You ain't that shy, baby, don't be actin' bashful
Hands all in it like I'm pickin' out a raffle
Roll up, light a candle
Shot after shot, never runnin' out of ammo
We some wild animals, fuck what the time is
Walk that line, you'll be up all night, bitch
Hell nah, we ain't high yet
Know I got that loud and you niggas sound quiet
In this bitch deeper than a choir
It's lookin' like your first time, baby, are you sure you wanna try it?
Are you sure you wanna try it? Are you sure you wanna try it?

[Hook]
Faster, faster, faster, faster

[Verse 2]
Say you wanna live faster, faster, I got what you asked for
All around the world, baby, hope you got your passports
Goin' outta town, gotta leave in the early morn'
I ain't even pack, all I need is a carry-on
I know this sound very strong
But I might just bring my Mary on
Leave your friends, so depressing like a Mary song
Still impressed by the suites at the Marriott
Come and let me upgrade you
Bad bitch sniffin' round, and she hit the nasal
Girls gone wild, taking shots from the navel
Somewhere overseas, man, my name's Mr. Navel
Peace
