[Chorus]
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your lighters at?
Let's burn it down
Fire back
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your light is at
Let's burn it down
Fire back

[Verse]
Uh, let's take it to the ground
Don't too many make it coming through our town
Looking for a detour nowhere to be found
When the pressure's on seems nobody's around
Uh, but I won't let them see me sweat
Ye it took a little time
But can't really be upset
Long way to the top
I can barely see the steps
Yeah, they sleeping on me still
But I barely need to rest
See me standing here head high
Face up, I don't need no X-Ray
Show you what I'm made of
Tell 'em I paid my dues and
You can check the pay stubs
Never had a chance so
I had to go and make one
Say some
You can tell them that
I've been through hell and back
But I'm home, can't really complain when
It's the life that I chose
Sacrificed it all and everything that I owned
Say what doesn't kill me can only make me stronger

[Chorus]
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your lighters at?
Let's burn it down
Fire back
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your light is at
Let's burn it down
Fire back

[Verse]
Yuh, can you feel the heat
The block is hot as ever
In these city streets
You only get one shot
Keep your arm steady
They tried to make me wait
But I'm more than ready
To go and get mine grind like an in-line
Skater check your wrist watch you'll see that
This time it's my time
And I don't need no invite
To the party, got roll over minutes and it
Feels like my calling, uh
I'm just doing what I can
With a whole lot of drive
Trying to make my own path
Take a chance, can't sit and worry about
No 5-year plan gotta live for the day
'Cause I could die where I stand
Tell 'em
You can tell them that
I've been through hell and back
But I'm home, can't really complain when
It's the life that I chose
Sacrificed it all and everything that I owned
Say "What doesn't kill me can only make me stronger"

[Chorus]
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your lighters at?
Let's burn it down
Fire back
You can tell them that
I've been from hell and back
When the heat is on
I fire back
In this cold world
Where your light is at
Let's burn it down
Fire back
