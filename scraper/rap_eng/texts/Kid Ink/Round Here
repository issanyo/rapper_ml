(Shit on)
(Yeah)
Ahh yeah

[Hook]
Round here, yeah on the D-low
Niggas 'round here call me Deebo
Round here, yo bitch'll get stole nigga
That's your section, not no more nigga
Yeah for real, round here niggas know I'm Deebo
Yeah, she know, he know, I'm Deebo

[Verse 1]
Niggas round here call me Deebo
Take a nigga girl, she reporting like I'm PO
Turn her from a 6, put the 1 before the 0
It ain't nothin' when I'm done
You know I cancel like Nino
Hoes ain't loyal but they free load
I remember when you used to give it up for free though
Now all you want is free dough
Something that your man lack, he can hold your hand
But he can't buy you no handbag
Cuff yo chick, you better tuck yo chain, round here
I'm Deebo and every day is Friday, round here
Said I'ma get you high girl, gon' slow it down
Just rolled up, took one hit, you got knocked the fuck out, okay

[Hook]
Round here, yeah on the D-low
Niggas 'round here call me Deebo
Round here, yo bitch'll get stole nigga
That's your section, not no more nigga
Yeah for real, round here niggas know I'm Deebo
Yeah, she know, he know, I'm Deebo

[Verse 2]
Might pull up on the bike and skrrt skrrt
Sup red-red bone, pocket check her ass first
First off don't be greedy if you tryna stay the night
Sippin' on champagne, you can't even say it right
Hate when niggas tryna battle, won't see the daylight
Know I'm winnin' like Floyd, you ain't gotta see the fight
No decision, when I roll up it's precision
Need a minute, lookin' hurt up in that corner that you sittin'
It's me and all my niggas, make you feel intimidated
No intention, we been payin' everybody too sedated round here
We been in here for a hour workin' on round ten
Nigga 10-4 this ain't no Nintendo

[Hook]
Round here, yeah on the D-low
Niggas 'round here call me Deebo
Round here, yo bitch'll get stole nigga
That's your section, not no more nigga
Yeah for real, round here niggas know I'm Deebo
Round here
Yeah, she know, he know, I'm Deebo nigga
