[Chorus]
No, this ain't nothing we ain't seen before
I knew it wouldn't be no easy road
Ear Drummers
And all they wanna do is see me fold
I can't let it go
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
I can't let it go
Go

[Verse 1]
Thought it was over but I'm back again
They tried to hold me down and back me in
I gotta, keep all my enemies as close as friends
So close I can taste (taste)
That's that sweet revenge
This gon' be the end
But you won't see the end
I know you seen the scars (tatted)
Deep beneath the skin
I'm gon' make you feel it (feel it)
I can't find my feelings
War made me a killer
The war made me a villain

[Chorus]
No, this ain't nothing we ain't seen before
I knew it wouldn't be no easy road
And all they wanna do is see me fold
I can't let it go
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
I can't let it go
Go

[Verse 2]
Said, any day could be that time
Better watch your back
Un-til the day that I flat-line
Can you see my new moves
You ain't seen my bad side
You don't wanna cross that line
I'ma loose my last mind
I'm tryna get in my zone
All of your energy wrong
I know at the end of the day
I'ma be sittin' alone
You ain't wanna run into me
You shouldn't have sit at the throne

[Chorus]
No, this ain't nothing we ain't seen before
I knew it wouldn't be no easy road
And all they wanna do is see me fold
I can't let it go
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
Now it's personal
I can't let it go
Go
