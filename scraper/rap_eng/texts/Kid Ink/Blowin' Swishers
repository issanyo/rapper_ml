[Verse 1]
Yeeaah , Uh
Come in where I wanna
Eyes wide shut, clothes reek of marijuana
It's stuffy up in here, got it looking like a sauna
Smoking kills, Terminator, you can call it Sarah Conner
Got you coughing, like you got a cold nigga

[Hook]
Fuck you doin? Blowin swishers

[Verse 2]
Man and I'm high as hell
Yeah my life is like a movie hope you got a still
I'm ill mufucka, I don't need a meal
But my pockets got the munchies and feed em well
Why your money lookin like it's on the diet pill?
I can eyeball that, I ain't gotta scale
Split it down, dump it nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And I'm tryna smoke with all of y'all
Rolling papers, man I feel like a ball hog
I can't pass that the way I hit
That's only one round, Mike Tyson
Ain't no papers in my house, I don't write shit
But your bitch is prolly here on a nightshift
Baby stop by the store, but I don't need liquor

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Cause I'mma get you high tonight
Once you learn how to roll, it's a riding bike
Said I'm over niggas heads on Cloud 9
Fuck what you got, my nigga smell mine
This ain't a art gallery, why everybody starin'?
Got a house full of bunnies where the fuck is Anna Faris?
I'm in the cut, you can keep your Rizla's

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
And I don't wanna hear that it tastes good
One hit of this, you feel it and your face good
We cookin baby you can meet me over here
Got everybodys eyes lookin' medium rare
How I'm comin on the beat is fucking really unfair
See the haters talk shit, but I really don't care
You can all suck a dick and feel it in your throat nigga

[Hook]
