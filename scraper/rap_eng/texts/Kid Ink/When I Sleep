Let you know something about me
I'm a Southern boy! Know what I'm talking about?

[Hook - Ned Cameron]
I remember all the days stuck in December
Caught in the rain, all the pain, having no money come my way
But now I'm making money even when I sleep
Eyes wide awake, but I really need a dream
We hustle, hustle

[Verse 1]
I go by Weezy, baby, so call me "Lil Weezle"
My city is New Orleans, baby, my street is Eagle
And that's my nigga's ?
He like to break a piece
He got the gun, I got the rope, my nigga pick a tree
Ain't talking money, I let the nickel speak
Niggas think I'm cheap, you ain't gon cent to me
The only thing to be: a picture on your shirt
No homo: I put your dick in the dirt
Flip em like a shovel with that wrist work
I stop ya, heard? I keep em coming like clockwork
J cool with the jump, it's an outburst
And we gon' be from South Philly til the South dirt
Baton Rouge, Lafayette or the Outskirts
It's lilWeezyana stay in your house jerk,
This ain't a concert, this ain't a hot verse
This a lot worse, so hear the shot burst:

[Hook - Ned Cameron]

Every hustle, we hustle, hustle - hey!

[Verse 2 - Kid Ink]
Straight from the bottom, now I'm high as a mountain
From the city where you need way more protection than a condom
Had a dream but I'm conscious, see the veins in my sockets
In the sky, wishing I could turn this plane into a rocket
And just leave here, more money but the problems still live here
I feel the pressure from my lil peers
Cause I'm about to blow, Swisher Sweet breathe in
One hit, lose your breath, all I do is (breathe) win
Big fish swimming in the deep end
No present, fuck I'm into pretense
I remember rainfall in the street
Now I'm in the club: watch me make this bitch precipitate
I promised to myself I would be the best
You could say I'm crazy or a mess
Just hand me a wrench
And it's nothing you can tell a ho
Life is just a bitch, I'll forgive her but I'll never forget
