[Hook]
Tell me can you feel the same
When everything's down the drain
Wish it didn't have to hurt

[Verse: Kid Ink]
Yeah
Just take a look into my mirrored eyes
Get to know me well, memorize
You can say what you want a million times
But I will never stop see you at the finish line
Laces tied, ready set go
Man I use to give a fuck but I don't feel that way no more
Just wish I had a genie in a bottle but I'm looking at Ciroc
About to drink away my sorrows until it's over,over
Where's my four leaf clover?
Ain't trying to complain I just need a little closure

[Hook]
Tell me can you feel the same
When everything's down the drain
Wish it didn't have to hurt
But I need you to feel the pain
The pain
Tell me can you feel the same
The same
I need you to feel the pain

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah
Then maybe you can understand
Not just an angry man this wasn't a part of plan
But here I stand making sure no doubt is showing
Always hated math now got everybody counting on me
Countless moments, I remember days
I couldn't eat for days, won't sleep till the grave
Feel the chills in the cold world, I'm about to blaze up
Born to fly but they trying to have my wings cut

[Hook]
Tell me can you feel the same
When everything's down the drain
Wish it didn't have to hurt
But I need you to feel the pain
The pain
Tell me can you feel the same
The same
I need you to feel the pain

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Yeah
And the pressure sitting back second guessing if I'm giving it my all
With every body asking questions
If I made it yet
Still in school
Got a job
Still a fool
All them tattoos now what you think that looks cool?
God damn right, baby this is my life and I'mma live it up just how I want to until I die
So you can pay me what Iâ€™m worth (or)
Pay me no mind I
Don't give a fuck, middle finger to the sky like

[Hook]

Tell me can you feel the same
When everything's down the drain
Wish it didn't have to hurt
But I need you to feel the pain
The pain
Tell me can you feel the same
The same
I need you to feel the pain
