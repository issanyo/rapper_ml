[Intro]
Yeah, come on, uh

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm sitting right on top of the world
Me and my blunt, think I'mma jump
Don't need a parachute, I'm flyer than a bird
Said here I come, man I'm so high
It feels like I'm sitting right on top of the world
Think I'm 'bout to jump jump, jump jump jump jump jump
It feels like I'm sitting right on top of the world
Think I'm 'bout to jump jump, jump jump jump jump
It feels like I'm sitting right on top of the world

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I said the view up here is beautiful
Looking down, could barely see the floor
I'm killing competition, I can tell they all worried
Cause I been on top of my game, missionary
But the mission is get that money, don't trust no bitch
Cake nigga tell me where the icing is, wouldn't waiting for this shit is Kiss
And I ain't gon' get that stuff for nothing, start to finish, keep on running
Screaming "Fuck the world" and you can tell that ho to keep on coming
Keep on coming, I'mma fuck around and de-bo something
Who the shit? I can feel it in my stomach
So sick, think I need a referral
It's just me and yo girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know you hear me on the radio, see me in the video
Tell 'em I ain't sign no deal yet though
But I live that life they killing for, sky high with a nigga ceiling fo
Somewhere chilling with a centrefold, already known where we finna go
Up, up, up, now just jump, jump, jump
When you hear that bump, bump, bump
I swear I just can't get enough, so I live it up, like it's my last one
Light up and pass one, hit it with a passion
The future coming, I'mma fuck around and cleat on
Told you I was gonna make it, I shoulda bet my money
But I get my money
Never sweat my money

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Right on top of the world
Right on top of the world
Right on top of the world
Right on top of the world
I said it's Kid Ink baby, go
