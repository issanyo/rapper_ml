[Intro: Bei Maejor]
Going up (x3)

[Hook: Bei Maejor]
Girl, you know we really smoke well
And it's a private party later at my hotel (room)
So you should fall through a little later
Baby, if you're down, meet me at the elevator

And we, going up (x6)
On the elevator baby

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Going up, got you high as (sigh)
Hope that ain't your girl, cause tonight I got her cuffed
I'm on that, a-a-a-a-ass
Hit it from the back
Don't give her the D, she be acting like a brat
Baby, alright, we can do it all night
Hop inside my backseat, hit it on the car ride
Just lift up your left leg, swear you ain't gonna walk right
Trying to say my name, she can't even talk right

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
It might be plenty of them, but they ain't got any on me
Girl gone inside of my suite because I got two 20-10's and they freakin'
If you say this chick is your girl, nigga why she all up on me?
It's me and Jay Fresco, she gassed up like petrol
Got her hand all up in my Levi's, Hatin' niggas you knee-high
Your girl's on me like, gone like she T.I
Time is money we banging, lay it down like she planking
Pocket's full of Ben Franklins, body know that you done been thinking
About my elevator

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
Baby I know you nervous, I know this your first time
Usually I don't do this, but damn, girl, you're fine
Hop up in my elevator, shawty press the penthouse
Put this all up in you, I could probably knock your ribs out
Cause you ain't messing with no amateur
Gone off a redbull in two minutes, I hope that you got stamina
Cause all I wanna do is be with you, get some privacy
Turn the phones off, shawty I'm so throwed off
So let's make love
Show you what this Ohio nigga's made of
See if you don't climb on top, I'm hittin all your spots
Feeling your body aftershock, that's how it is when you're with Wizzle, baby

[Hook: Bei Maejor]

[Verse 4: Bei Maejor]
I'm trying to follow something new, so I hit her up to come through
You may call her your girlfriend, I just call her my little boo
I swooped up, cooped up in that 6 speed
She hopped in and she kissed me
Probably cause I can hit it, and I'm rich, no Ken Griffey
Now we pouring up them shots in here, laid up like cots in here
She put her hands on the wall like cops in here
I threw a glove on like boxing gear
Up, up, and away
She'll come down in a couple of days
I cooled off with a cup full of spades
She felt good, lit a couple of jays
