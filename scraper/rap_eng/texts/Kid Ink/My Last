[Hook]
I feel like every night, might be my last
I-I don't sleep at night, ev-every night might be my last, b-b-be my last
I feel like every night, night, night, night, night, might be my last
I-I don't sleep at night, every night might be my last
I feel like every night

[Verse 1]
I should pack and go away
All this pain where I stay, lets go fucking M.I.A
Trying find a way out, its like a needle in a hay
See so many go to waste, disappear right in my face
Man I (feel like every night), its gonna be my fucking time
Getting tired, trying make it to the top without a tie
Bunch of tats set me back, man its just a bunch of lies
Living proof, hunnit proof, nigga you don't wanna shot

[Hook]
I feel like every night, night, night, night, night, might be my last
I don't sleep at night, every night might be my last
I feel like every night

[Verse 2]
I should up and quit the game
I've been going so insane, that I don't know my fucking name, between the fame and reality
Hope you ready for a cameo, cause ain't no telling where the cameras be
Just let it roll out (I feel like every)
It's gonna be my fucking highest, see my eyes, no lies, ain't no way I that I could hide it man
Everything is clear about the grind and the struggle
Never had a hand out, never worry about tomorrow
Said I

[Hook]
I feel like every night, night, night, night, night, might be my last
I don't sleep at night, every night might be my last
B-b-be my last, be my last, be my last
Be my, be my, be my last, be my last, be my last, be my, be my, be my last
Uh

[Verse 3]
All these thoughts in my mind, animal in my heart
But I donâ€™t walk with the lions
On this yellow brick road, all I see is fucking cowards
Bet you they don't teach you million in a year over at Howard
Tell 'em (I feel like every night)
Its gonna be my one and last, I just pray at my funeral that everybody laugh
And remember all the times that we had a fucking blast
Was he high when he died, you don't even have to ask
Man I

[Hook]
I feel like every night, night, night, night, night, might be my last
(I said) I don't sleep at night, every night might be my last
I feel like every night

[Verse 4]
I could probably lose it all
I could win, lose a draw, play the cards where they fall
Sick of hiding in the fog, blow the smoke in your face
Feel the pressure in your lungs, something heavy on my waist
Man I [bow] (feel like every night)
Its gonna be my fucking best, gotta keep the right mentality so I don't get depressed
Been so stressed from these leeches and these anorexic bitches on my neck
I don't have time to hear you vent so...

[Hook]x2
I feel like every night, night, night, night, night, might be my last
I-I don't sleep at night, every night might be my last
Be my last, be my last, be my last
Be my, be my, be my last
Be my last, be my last, be my, be my, be my
