[Verse 1]
Know you see me sitting on the cloud high
Fresh up out the kitchen
Broke that bitch right up on that counter top
Me and Mary Jane, Bloody Mary’s in the mirror
Say my name three times, I’ll be there with that killer

Can you smell what we smoking on
Let me break it down, nugget size of a poke-ball
Doctor Green Thumb
Swear just one pick up have your finger
Feeling like the back side of a sticker

Only rolling (Bom Bom), need a swisher
Shawty says she got a pom pom
She ain't right now girl, it don’t matter to me
No subtraction, tell ‘em I’m a addict baby, ugh

[Hook]
It feels like I’m in a daze, my mind in a haze
You can see it in my ways uhh
But we do this everyday, anybody got a problem wit it
You know what I’m saying ah
Roll up, Roll up, Roll up, Roll up, Roll up
Get right to it, you ain’t even gotta ask
You know what the fuck I’m doing

[Verse 2]
I roll it like a diploma, high up
Trying not to fall in a kush coma, yeah (Yeah)
Second hand smoke, just from the aroma, yeah (Yeah)
Smell that loud niggas telling me to tone it down
Ugh got a nigga barely moving
Stoned like I’ve been eye fucking with Medusa
Right to the medulla, nah this ain't a Cuban
But it make your blunt look skinny like a q-tip
We-we-we blowing up bombs
So just relax, sit back and kick off your toms
You’re looking for the light, I got it like Tron
Ain’t nobody on the level that I’m on, ugh

[Hook]
