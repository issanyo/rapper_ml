Double shots
Double bitches
Double chains
You could see 'em drippin'
Drip, Drip, Drip and gold
I'm, I'm, I'm drippin' bitch
Wet as fuck
Spillin shit
Drip, drip, drip
I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
She drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
We drippin'
Gettin' drippin' bitch
Get drippin' bitch
Drip, drip, drip
I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
She drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
We wet as fuck, spillin shit

[Verse 1]
Tryin' not to slip and fall
With your girl, all over my dick and balls
Can't somebody roll up, drippin'
Sippin' like itâ€™s soda, night is ending in a coma
Hands in the air, Gollum
I'm the lord of rings, drippin' in gold
Looking like Kobe, bitches think I'm flyin' out
Bitch I think I'm fucking solar
Say my ego big now I say it's fucking bolder
Barn, now come and give me head and
Shut your fucking know it
Ah, but she say she don't play that
She just say that 'till I hit it doggy style
The big payback,throwing money like a Arab
You ain't gotta gas me
We shut this motherfucker down last week
Take a seat

[Verse 2]
I see some double D's
I'm double taking
She with a friend
D-d-double teaming
Bottom's up
Why your face down
Now bring your head back
Like you ain't trying to drown
How many drinks you had
I think I lost count
One, two wasted
Oscar The Grouch
In this bitch, Kris Kross
Jumping on the couch
Now bring that cookie over here
Like a girl scout
Drippin' everywhere
Ball of chains, Kool Moe Dee
Feelin' like money
Take a picture, say cheese
You are talking to an animal. Just like Dr. Doolittle
Only one me, but I think that I see two of you
