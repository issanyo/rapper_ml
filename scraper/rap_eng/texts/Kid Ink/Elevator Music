[Chorus]
I know we really smoke well
But it's a private party later at my hotel room
You should come by a lil later
If you down girl meet me at the elevator then we
Going up

[Verse 1]
Going up, but I wanna lie you down like no trust
Your body's so fire, might erupt
It's a long way to the top say you can't rush love
Just tell me that it's lust
And we can start right here on the elevator
Let me get you high, get you elevated
Penthouse, X-rated
Let's unwind we are running out of time girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, going going right into the ozone
Wit yo friends, you should tell them so long
Just met, feels like I waited so long
Do it, I ain't tryna leave solo
Forget about your ex
Meet me at the elevator, leave him at the steps and
I'ma work you out, put in a couple reps
We up all night baby we don't need a rest, said

[Chorus]
