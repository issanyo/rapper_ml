[Verse 1]
Let me get you high for the moment
Fuck five, what I'm smoking, I'mma need a dub on it
Know that swisher's all we blowing, leave the paper for the toilet
Gotta tip and a molly and a bitch that keep it rolling uh
Know you smell me when we rolling up
Me and Miss Mary Jane yeah, we so in love
It's Friday just call me Smokey in this motherfucker
Overseas, snuck a OZ over customs
What you got on it? Show me the dough nigga
Where I'm from you don't drop, you don't smoke with us
Uh me too on the double
If you tryna match up like a puzzle, holla at me

[Chorus]
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressing over here
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressing over here
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressing over here
And if it ain't OG I ain't even tryna hit it, what
No sticks no seeds we ain't stressing over here

[Verse 2]
Okay I'm smoking on that good, we don't tote no Reggie
'Bout to roll another one up, fat as Miss Piggy
Said if you ain't got that OG then you ain't fucking with me
That Denise Williams leave a nigga feeling silly
I can't really feel my face
But I'm feeling myself, outta line, outta space
Burning like the fireplace, I got the fire in this place
You think I'm lying, come and try me I leave you crying like mace
I said I'm higher then a kite, no strings attached
You ain't gotta put it out baby, go and bring it back
Smoke it down to the ground, you ain't gotta miss this
All my niggas round me got trees like its Christmas
Just tryna keep it subtle
Call me rocket ship shawty xome and hop up on my shuttle uh
I break it down into rubble
If you tryna match up like a puzzle holla at me

[Chorus]
