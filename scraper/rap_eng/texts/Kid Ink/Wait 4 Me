[Hook]
Girl you can hit me on my phone whenever you are alone
Ready for me to come take you down
Baby girl I'm on my way, I don't mind that you play
You ain't gotta, you ain't gotta
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me, wait for me
Girl just make sure that you think of me
Think of me, think of me, think of me, think of me, think of me

[Verse 1]
Girl it's okay, you don't need to waste no time
I won't be jealous babe, just keep me on your mind
It ain't a crime go ahead and unwind
Nobody gotta know but me so baby don't be shy
You know your spots, just make sure that the door unlocked
When I walk in baby girl don't stop, I'mma sit back here for a minute and watch
I'm your biggest fan, when you get tired I can lend a hand
I'mma be back real soon, but 'til then girl you know what to do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I know I'm running late, but here I come to help
Since you can't love me babe, until you can love yourself
Rub yourself, it turns me on when
You show me that you comfortable inside your own skin
So use your mind and baby not your eyes
And make sure you move your hips, counter clock wise
This ain't forever, just in the meanwhile
You can call me night time cause I bring them freaks out

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I said you ain't gotta wait
Just pulled up feeling good all day
Sorry that a nigga had to work so long
I was up in the studio making this song
