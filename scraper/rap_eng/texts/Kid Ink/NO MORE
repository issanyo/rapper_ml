I'll be leaving without you babe
Leaving without you babe
Leaving without you babe
I'll be leaving without you baby
Woah, woah, woah
Baby I'm going, going, gone
Going, going, gone
I ain't thinking bout you no more
No more, no more
I ain't worried bout you no more
No more, no more
Baby I'm going, going, gone
I'm going, going, gone

[Julian:]
Damn girl why you bring so much drama
Girl you got problems and no I can't solve em
And how did you come friends with my ex girl
Talked to my homie on the side
I read texts girl
I shoulda saw it come cause I'm smarter than that
I was blind off love and what I thought was that
But I ain't coming back you messed up
But I ain't gon trip cause karmas a bitch, uh

No more, no more, no more
I ain't worried bout you no more
No more, no more
I ain't thinking bout you no more
No more, no more
Baby I'm going going gone
I'm going going gone

[Langston:]
See ya later I'm going outta here, bye
Ain't nobody thinkin' bout you cause a nigga to fly
We only ran into each other girl don't be shy
And I ain't the right dude to come try to tie down
Never down so I'm with the eagles
And if a girl set me up I will get lethal
Like a weapon girl get to steppin'
Find another crew cause the rangers ain't whatchu reppin

No more, no more, no more
I ain't worried bout you no more
No more, no more
I ain't thinking bout you no more
No more, no more
Baby I'm going going gone
I'm going going gone

[Day Day:]
I don't really need you I'm a ranger re-ep
Attitude is b.s go ahead and ste-ep
Move it to the left, to the left, to the le-eft
My feelings for you are slanted
Moving in a downwards fashion
And I'm done with you boo go ahead and boo hoo
Now you feeling clueless
Don't know what to find true love
It walked out on you you lose, bye

[Spotlight:]
I ain't thinking bout you baby
I think you that you should leave
I ain't the type of nigga to wear emotions on my sleeve
If you wanna bounce it ain't gon bug me
I ain't fallin in love with you at 16
Girl I'm livin life and just doin' my thing
Before you go tell me what's your homegirl name
She could be the one that could rock this bling
In the morning and I'm dippin I could'ntremember a thing ha

No more, no more, no more
I ain't worried bout you no more
No more, no more
I ain't thinking bout you no more
No more, no more
Baby I'm going going gone
I'm going going gone
