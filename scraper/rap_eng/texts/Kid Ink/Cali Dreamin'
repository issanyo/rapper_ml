[Chorus X2]
California dreaming, dreaming
California dreaming, dreaming
California dreaming, dreaming
I'm gonna stay, stay, stay

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Say you might see bunch of beaches, bunch of pretty bitches
But, don't get it twisted, wrong turn could be missing
Stay riding with the bros like a car full of siblings
Kush running through my system straight from California California
Swear you ain't never gon' leave if you get a whiff of this
Yeah my life is like a movie, nigga you can get a clip
Hear they shooting better chip, that mean you should probably dip
Any city I don't trip out in, California California
Cause bitch I'm good where ever I go, name any hood nigga bet I know
Headed to the store for Swisher Sweets and a tall can of Arizona
The sun hotter than a sauna, where you from better own up
Ugh, throw it up California California

[Chorus x2]
California dreaming, dreaming
California dreaming, dreaming
California dreaming, dreaming
I'm gonna stay, stay, stay

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
So don't wake me up, from my dream don't wake me up
But I got a quarter pound baby, you can weigh me up
All my bitches weigh a buck, 25 buck 40
Born bad like the army straight from California California
All the way turnt up, white tee, pair of Chucks
Let me re-design you, been that way since high school
Nigga and yo girl, she been on my dick since high school
I'm sorry if you move back to California California
Cause I've been here Hollywood all the way to the vantage
That's where nigga used to get my dro, nigga I'm on Sunset selling out shows
If it ain't table and a bottle I ain't going, so much smoke man a nigga can't breathe
Have some fun baby girl don't leave, stay here, California California

[Chorus x2]
California dreaming, dreaming
California dreaming, dreaming
California dreaming, dreaming
I'm gonna stay, stay, stay

[Outro]
Uh, California California, uh
