[Intro]
I think I got a single
Oh, I think I got a single oh

[Hook: Ty$]
It ain't hard to see that I'm doing my thing
And I ain't gon' to stop 'til everybody know my name
Better cuff yo chick, cause I'll take that
First I wanna see if I can take over the world
She take over the world
Lady, sing now, yeah, yeah
Lady, sing now, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah, watch me take over the world
Give me just 5 minutes, I'mma take over your girl
Said it's fuck you pay me, put the money in my pocket
On the first class rocket, tryna find out where to park it
You can meet me on the moon, but you might not make it
They can't breathe where I'm going, how many times I gotta say it?
I'm on a championship team like the Lakers
Tryna get more rings than a pack of LifeSavers
Yeah, I'm on L, plug me in the socket
I ain't even worried 'bout you haters you ain't even in my optic
Cause the money in the way, all I see is profit
I'mma go, go get her, try to see if you can stop me now

[Hook: Ty$]
It ain't hard to see that I'm doing my thing
And I ain't gon' to stop 'til everybody know my name
Better cuff yo chick, cause I'll take that
First I wanna see if I can take over the world, she take over the world

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I'm headed to the front, shotgun
Hop up out the whip, looking flyer than Top Gun
Headed to the top, penthouse level
So high I think I can see the stairway to heaven
Sitting on cloud nine, can you can go see me through the smoke?
All about my money, you can see it in my clothes
Cause everything goes, every chain gold
I done came a long way down this yellow brick road
I remember selling all I own
Now all I do is sell out of all my shows
All eyes on me, while I'm on stage
Let's take over the world like Pinky and the Brain, I said

[Hook]

[Outro]
Uh, I said it's Kid Ink baby 'bout to take over the world
Got the money and the power 'bout to take over your girl
Said it's Kid Ink baby 'bout to take over the world
Got the money and the power 'bout to take over your girl, yeah
