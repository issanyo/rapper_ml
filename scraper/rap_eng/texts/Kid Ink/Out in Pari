[Intro: Vee Tha Rula]
Toast to the lords
Love to the lords
Rula

[Verse 1: Vee Tha Rula]
Excuse me motherfucka
You ain't even mention my name
I set fire to slim rhymers
That battery gotta timer
Damn
Could bruh man get another sandwich
I was on the 4th floor
Tryna eat some salmon
Now I'm on the top floor
Chillin' in the hammock
Nigga no pot piss poor
Nappy braid pit bulls
Talkin' like a pit bull
No food
Pissed off, ah
Its like that tryna ball huh?
Walkin' out with Gucci bags from the store huh?
Now a nigga Don Perry in the mall
King kush lookin' scary in the 4
Come thru dress hangin' on my arm
Throw it up
Kill a banger where you from
Gold drippin' from my pinky to my thumb
Uh

Niggas lookin' outdated
Hey

And I like that ukulele
A nigga got that cri-nack

Let the UPS bring it baby
Library to rent that
You could never miss a payment
Girl I never miss a payment
I mean Jessa got some titties
Went and moved her ass to Vegas

With them lips and them hips
Thank God ya mamma made it

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Uh, I said its Kid Ink baby
Somewhere out here in Pari
Still I'm smokin' on
L.A. California Mary
Ain't no comparin'
One thing apparent (what?)
Walkin' round here
Nigga stand out like I'm from a whole nother planet
And my bitch straight out a beauty pageant
High as the Eiffel
Baby don't panic
We be up late night
Like Jimmy Fallon
Eyes blood red like Carrie
Eatin' over here
Never been a fan of famine
Wearin' all black
Nigga lookin' like a phantom
Tell me what to do
Real nigga never get it confused
From the streets
You could meet me in the room
No rules
Ain't no postcard with my view
Understand that

[Hook]

So much hate I need a AK

[Verse 4: HardHead]
W-W-Walk right out of the catacombs
Maids bringin' in Crêpes at 8 in the morn
Bottle service all night
But no service on my phone
Driving by the Eiffel Tower with a bitch named Mona Lisa
Go [?] duffle full of swisher sweets
Shoppin' up in Balmain
Posted up
No emojis my nigga
Its 4B's back
And you know we my nigga
(Lets go)
Been around the world
But I'm still in the streets
In your bitch DM like bonjour
We on tour
Ain't slept in a week
With a pocket full of euros
Tryna get more
Its our time
Nigga I told you we in this bitch
Ho the game been over
Disrespect the team
Catch em' on the scene
Niggas lose a king
Way quicker than Erik Spoelstra

[Hook]
Now we out in Pari
Niggas still hatin'
Now we out in Pari
White girls politicin'
Now we out in Pari
Yeah I'm Perriering
Now we out in Pari
Niggas still-white girls
