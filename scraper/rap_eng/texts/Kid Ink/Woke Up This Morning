Okay I woke up this morning
Ready for the evening
(It's the same shit, nothing new)
Okay I woke up this morning
Ready for the evening
(Got a bag of money just for you)
All I can think about is bright lights, and throwing dough, y'already know
(Girl you the reason that all my bills on the floor)
Ugh, all I keep thinkin bout is your ass and that dance floor girl
(So many reasons, to get your ass on the floor)

[Verse 1]
Okay I woke up this morning
Ready for the evening
This ain't nothing new
We do this every day and weekend
Same shit last night, four hours of sleepin'
Your girl probably creepin', with me it ain't no secret
I ain't even high, trying to find where my pick is
All this green around me gotta break it into pieces
Hater's throwin' shade don't be lookin' but I peeped it
Bet you they still outside by the valet where my keys at
But we in here, whole team clear, know me
Bitches fallin from the ceiling like Cirque du Soleil
Who tryin' to battle I just might spend your rent bill, 'round rent time
I pay everything but attention, only one thing on my mind
Okay

[Verse 2]
Okay
The party ain't over so why you stoppin' dancin'
What you need a refill?
Know I got the answer
Always got your phone out
I should take your battery
These bitches be like "We be poppin' bottles" still ain't had a drink
Stop with all your acting, you deserve an academy award
Tried to warn ya, we do it so casually
Killer by the hour, then I'm ready for the after .... party
You can meet me in the parking for the address
Just don't bring no extras
Ain't trying to be on Extra, TMZ in my Bedroom
Got a couple bottles here, might need more before too
See my eyes red, Rozay, Moe'z is my go-to
