[Intro]
Yo, I said it's Kid Ink baby

[Verse 1]
You ready? This your last chance
Put on your seatbelts, I'm 'bout to crash land
The way I touch down, I should have a dance
Teach you how to stunt, I could have a class
Roll another blunt, burn a little hash
I got my money up and learned to build the math
All these green faces like I fucking got the mask
You can't walk in my shoes like you fucking got a cast
See my riding through the city like I'm racing in the drag
Got the thing in the bag, put the burner in the pass
On the highway of life, think I'm running outta gas
See Miss UFO, 20/20 on the tattoo
Tall ass niggas you can never understand
Said it's Kid Ink baby, listen, you can hear 'em chant
I'm the future like I just hopped out of the DeLorean
Got off world tour, I'll be going back again
Try to front on a nigga but I'm 'bout to back 'em in
Ladies, Chi-Town veteran but all I do is win
Never strap up, stretch, do some fucking celestines
Chew you up, spit you out but I ain't motherfucking finished
No, I run this shit like I grew up with the sinners
Smoking on that good tree, you be smoking on the trimmers
Look around see, everything green like feeling money
Help a nigga stay fly, fly like quidditch, ha
You niggas just dry old bitches
I'm the hottest thing moving, start a fire in the winter
So raw, little wasabi and some ginger
Is all I need to eat you motherfuckers up for dinner, tell 'em
