[Intro]
You know it
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
You know it
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
You know it

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on a hill with a view lookin' over the Westside
Sunset time know the freaks come out like a vampire
I don't just play for the team
Baby girl got a piece of the franchise
Trynna frat nice
It's a party at the crib every night like a frathouse

[Hook]
You know it
You know it, you know it
Don't ask how important
I knew you before this
When you was just whorin'
I know the whole star

[Verse 2]
I ain't trynna judge you at all the room
Sit back, take a hit of Diablo
And a sip of the Ace, play your cards right
Riding in My Own Lane hittin' all strikes, all night!

[Hook]
You know it
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
You know it
You know it, you know it
You know what you doin'
You know it

[Outro]
You know it
You know it, you know it
You know it, you know it
