[Hook] Paul Wall & Kid Ink:
I be gettin' tho'd, I be gettin' tho'd
I be gettin' tho'd, I be gettin' tho'd, man I be gettin' tho'd
I be gettin' tho'd, I be gettin' tho'd
I be gettin' tho'd, I be gettin' tho'd, man I be gettin' tho'd
(Thoooo ooh ooh oh'd)
Don't take too long with my drink
(Thoooo ooh ooh oh'd)
Don't take too long with my drink

Paul Wall:
Po' up, I be gettin' muddy
Got that act right, on deck buddy
Gotta power up, double cup, yeah you know what's up
Hold up, don't mind me, I'm gettin' money
Codeine got me leanin' like a kickstand
Vodka and cran' with a xan' I'm gettin' ?
Mixin' up the drank, rollin' up the stank
I be gettin' bank, when it comes to gettin' tho'd, I'm the man
Two cups, two hands, I call that a four way
Ridin' with a throw away, hater I don't play
Swisher full of hay, gettin' pay, tho'd everyday
I'm loaded, you can see it in my face

Kid Ink:
Okay, tell me where the waitress
Tryin' get a tip, need a cup in my hand
Uh, you know we tho'd off a pitcher
Groupies tryin' to get a picture for their instagram
Wait, I got a table in the back
They ain't wanna let me in with a hat, but I walk right through
Now, came 'bout twenty deep, couple of 'em had fake I.D.s
But I got the whole crew in
Criss-cross on the couch, I ain't gonna leave 'til they kick a nigga out
After that, the party at the house
Tryin' to catch up, we out the park

YG:
I be gettin' tho'd, I be gettin' hoes
I be at the jeweler with some cash, gettin' gold
All bro's ain't bro's
Some of y'all done told, I done gave y'all shit
So some of y'all owe
Rock on my pinky, my white girl dinky
Fucked my bitch raw, then nutted on her chi-chis
Got Fendi on my belt, got Fendi on my shoes
KCAL9, all my homies with the news
Uh, nigga I'm a gang banger
All my homies dry their clothes outside on a hanger
Uh, nigga I be gettin' tho'd, bitch so bad put a ring on her toes
