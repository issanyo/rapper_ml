[Pre-Chorus]
All I gotta do is pull up with the pound right now and I could get high with you (yeah)
All she gotta do is drop somethin' down, move around, while I pitch a couple bands to the roof
Let's bend a couple rules and get another room, that's a lil' more private, all eyes on you
All you gotta do is (ooh), motivate me with your movement

[Chorus]
While I throwing all these dead pres'
Watch me hit 'em with the finesse
You don't wanna check for damage
I put that ass to bed rest

[Verse 1]
Watch me pull up in the coupe
Two seater, I got the double with the scoop
But it's a group, same niggas from the stu' (with me)
Dub city, I just send a alley oop
From the window to the wall
With the southshade from me when the money start to fall (okay)
Lookin' like Lamelo when I ball, might pump fake then watch 'em jump criss-cross, okay
I take my hand and I put on your waist
She look and tell me nigga, this ain't no race
It's all good I can move with your pace
While I wait I'ma break it down like mmmh
Roll some then we blow it to the moon
Hit the gas and you feel that shit like vroom vroom
Legs up and I ate that shit like mmmh
Need a boom boom boom baby

[Pre-Chorus]
All I gotta do is pull up with the pound right now and I could get high with you (yeah)
All she gotta do is drop somethin' down, move around, while I pitch a couple bands to the roof
Let's bend a couple rules and get another room, that's a lil' more private, all eyes on you
All you gotta do is (ooh), motivate me with your movement

[Chorus]
While I throwing all these dead pres'
Watch me hit 'em with the finesse
You don't wanna check for damage
I put that ass to bed rest

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like J.F.K
Waving at the top of the hook, go crazy
Apeshit, got them bitches jumpin' out their cages
But can't get close, cause I'm way too famous
Still tryna keep it humble
While she bang, in the mirror see the gun smoke
Break it down need chains for the hundo'
Every man for themselves, Royal Rumble, okay
I'mma get you up and out them Balmains
See you walking by the hill with no string, (no strings) no strings
Simple and plain before your mind change lets ride a mmmh
Roll some then we blow it to the moon
Pump the gas and you feel that shit like vroom vroom
Legs up and I ate that shit like mmmh
Need a boom boom boom baby

[Pre-Chorus]
All I gotta do is pull up with the pound right now and I could get high with you (yeah)
All she gotta do is drop somethin' down, move around, while I pitch a couple bands to the roof
Let's bend a couple rules and get another room, that's a lil' more private, all eyes on you
All you gotta do is (ooh), motivate me with your movement

[Chorus]
While I throwing all these dead pres'
Watch me hit 'em with the finesse
You don't wanna check for damage
I put that ass to bed rest
While I throwing all these dead pres'
Watch me hit em with the finesse
You don't wanna check for damage
I put that ass to bed rest
