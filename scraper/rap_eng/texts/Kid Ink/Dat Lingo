[Hook: Vee Tha Rula]
I say damn, I'm just happy for my fam
Broke nigga to a million dollar man
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo
Smoke is floating out my mouth a double cup up in my hand
Yeah, niggas say I'm the hottest in the land
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo

[Verse 1: Vee Tha Rula]
I just sold a sack
Now I'm back home smoking on the sack
Don't get high on your own supply man
I'm just thankful I can rap
I swear this shit is just a trap a maze you run without a map
And man my girl won't text me back another bitch just text me back
Like why you actin' I've been texting
Other day we just was sexting
'Nother bitch just read the message
Lord this shit is getting messy
I just feel so special flexing watch out for Tha Rula
Study like a tutor smoking loud your shit is muted
This shit can get confusing cause this shit is more than music
When you down feel like you losing baby mom said you can do it
Raising crazy said he booling said he see me fooling
Just get ready for what's coming
When we on we going stupid
Ay my nigga shit is real
I just sealed a deal
Champagne on the chill lemme tell you how it feel

[Hook: Vee Tha Rula]
I say damn, I'm just happy for my fam
Broke nigga to a million dollar man
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo
Smoke is floating out my mouth a double cup up in my hand
Yeah, niggas say I'm the hottest in the land
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo

[Verse 2: Bricc Baby Shitro]
Look I pull up in that bitch and coat that cocaine brought that foreign
I sprinkle sprinkle on the booth the molly got me on
I just copped a closer that's a pint of lean I pour it
I keep a wooley on my hip and yeah I'm quick to blow it
I got niggas 13-toed trainers in the hood
They don't know no better cause their mama holding drugs
They don't want no hustle man they really kill their buzz
Gone off the water smoking sherm by the judge
Now my youngin' facing life and nigga that's a elbow
When you strapped up like Mac's fam we call that velcro
You know a nigga making juice I'm working 6 cell phones
Hate to front the Glock so I got it for the hell no

[Hook: Vee Tha Rula]
I say damn, I'm just happy for my fam
Broke nigga to a million dollar man

Yeah, niggas say I'm the hottest in the land
I say, you ain't even know dat lingo

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
You ain't even know dat lingo
A grand pre and a black gran tourino
To the club run the door down like Dino
Passing through Miami call me Inky Moreno
Champagne got me wet as a taquito
When you see me it's a wrap
For you rappers no burrito
Said I fucks with you un poquito
Finito excuse me I'm just tryna keep a C note
Remember back then all them bitches who would play me
When I was broke and now they want my million dollar baby
You used to be the baddest now you look just like Shanaynay
And then lost all of your ass and had another kid with Ray-Ray

[Hook: Vee Tha Rula]
I say damn, I'm just happy for my fam
