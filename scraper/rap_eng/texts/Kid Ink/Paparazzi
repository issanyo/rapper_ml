[Hook]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
I've known Paparazzi
Feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I've known Paparazzi
Feel so cold and I long for your embrace

[Verse 1]
Damn who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here
Talking to you about another path I
Know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way hold every memory
As you go and every road you take will always lead you home

[Hook]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
I've known Paparazzi
Feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I've known Paparazzi
Feel so cold and I long for your embrace

[Verse 2]
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong and what's
Small turn to a friendship, a friendship
Turn into a bond and that bond will never
Be broken and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what
We reach so remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way hold every memory
As you go and every road you take will always lead you home

[Hook]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight

Feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I've known Paparazzi
Feel so cold and I long for your embrace

[Bridge]
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

[Hook]
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go 'til you see the light
Take me home tonight

Feel so cold and I long for your embrace

[Outro]
