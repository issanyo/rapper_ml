[Verse 1]
I put you on, I put you in
You in the game, you and your friends
And now we at the foul line cuz you playin' dirty
Need two shots, cuz you playin' dirty
How you fit that in yo pants, know yo ass hurtin'
Know what you doin', your plans workin'
That smile chandelier and your rug Persian
Excuse me for talkin' not askin'
You know we gettin' high as can be
You the only one that understand me
Sometimes you ain't ready for that D, so

[Hook]
You playin' dirty

[Verse 2]
Can't feel your face, Hollywood nova
King, got that business if you actin' nosy
Okay, watch how the night gon' pan slowly
Out in Beverley Hills, nigga act so folly
It feel like we just fuckin' won Oscar
It feel like we just fuckin' left the Grammy's
Damn, this afterparty really goin' up, up
Only the main bitches showin' up, up
And you still tryna play them, play this game
You playin' dirty baby, I can play the, play the same
Make you say my name, I'm just sayin', so

[Hook]
You playin' dirty

You playin' dirty, cuz you playin' dirty

[Verse 3; TrinidadRee]
Shawty playin' dirty I can see it in her eyes
If I take your heart out you gone be my valentine
There's no way around it Ima different kind of guy
Lemme show you all around if you wanna hit the sky
I, might, show you what the worlds like
If I ever be yo man I know how to treat you like
No there's no reason to be sneaky
Let's slow it down and take it easy, Ree

[Outro]
I'm sayin', I'm sayin', I'm sayin', I'm sayin'
Again, again, again, and again, alright, alright
I'm sayin', I'm sayin', I'm sayin', I'm sayin'
When I get you to the back girl we gon' do it
Again, again, again, and again
