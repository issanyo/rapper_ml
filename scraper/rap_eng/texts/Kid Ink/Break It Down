[Verse 1]
She knows how to break it down, I can give her that
Give it to her, laying on her back, yeah
Pound that pussy like a dap, hope you ready for attack
Turn it up, climax
Call me Santa Clause, sit it on my lap
Now bring it back and take them panties off
Let me see that ass
Turn me on all night baby I can duralast
Uh put it on the dresser by the lamp
Biting on her neck like a vamp
Got her wet, way past damp
Doing thangs she ain't doing with her man

[Chorus]
She know how to break it down, put it all on me
I can break her down to a piece
She know how to break it down
Girl I can break you down

[Verse 2]
I can give her that, give it to her
Laying on her chest
Sweat marinating on her breast
Go to work, lay her on the desk
And take them panties off
No, girl you can leave them panties on, uh
And I can pull it to the side, once I get inside
Say she ain't a freak I guarantee you that she lying
Baby girl let it go, yeah
Gon' let it show, uh

Your pussy is incredible, yeah

[Chorus]

Hook that pussy then I knock that ass out, yeah

Shoulda seen when I put it in my mouth

[Chorus]
