[Intro: Kid Ink]
Ooh, ah yeah

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Pop a wheelie with no hands, put it in the sky
Threw that bitch a lob, threw that bitch a lob
Money make her dance, put you on a job
Threw that bitch a lob, threw that bitch a lob

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Money bag, yo, go keep a chain, hundred bag
Backwood if you really 'bout that smoke
Know your type, only niggas that ain't broke
Dance in them Jimmy Choos, ayy
Your skin color a bottle of Yoo-hoo
That big old dude, I point and shoot
Came with the truth, case niggas start actin' boof
I can't refuse, she with y'all
Least she fighter with the moves
I threw that lob like I coulda went to Duke
Lil baby, it's just right 'cause she demand
Walk it like I talk it in these Vans, ah yeah

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Pop a wheelie with no hands, put it in the sky
Threw that bitch a lob, threw that bitch a lob
Money make her dance, put you on a job
Threw that bitch a lob, threw that bitch a lob

[Verse 2: Rory Fresco]
It ain't nothin' to me, jewelry cold like one degree
I'ma throw it all, it's gon' fall from a hundred feet
Rory don't do nothin' cheap, don't sleep at the Double Tree
Bad bitches run at me like, can you give me somethin' to see?
She gon' go long for the throat, my son her
And she all alone on her own, need a sponsor
I threw all this cash, if I do my math right
You just do a sash, I go through the smash
Livin' stupid fast, bitch, I do the dash
It ain't same type of shit that will get you to crash
Just know who in first, don't know who in last
I just threw the bag, if the truth be asked

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Pop a wheelie with no hands, put it in the sky
Threw that bitch a lob, threw that bitch a lob
Money make her dance, put you on a job
Threw that bitch a lob, threw that bitch a lob

[Verse 3: Juliann Alexander]
I could tell that she a fan, I'm a rock star with no band
I get money in advance, then I do my money dance
Can you throw it back on me by chance?
You a bad bitch, you ain't innocent
I just walked in with a brand new bitch
And a rock star clique, you can suck my dick
Rest in peace to Lil Peep, took a Xan in the whip
Swervin' on a highway, swervin' on your bitch

[Outro: Kid Ink]
Pop a willy with no hands, put it in the sky
Threw that bitch a lob, ooh that shit a vibe
Ooh, ah yeah
