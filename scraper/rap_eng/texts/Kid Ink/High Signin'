[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I swear all the shit I gotta face now
A nigga shine, get the shades out
You know how my eyes look when the haze out
I'm just trying with the fakes out
Reporting from the west-side
Bat-gang got it tatted on my left-side
Know you couldn't fuck with me on your best night
Now watch me screw these niggas like its test time
Hold up, flex on these niggas , hold up
Put the city on my shoulder
Came up from the noodles
Know they thought we'd be losers

[Verse 2: Jay 205]
Just moved the whole thang
On the west side, niggas gangbang
Icy fresh, high signin'
Bust down, looking like lightning
Call the friends, got diamonds
Feeling like baby big timing
But it take a lot of grinding
Project baby private flying
Made it out the jungle, I'm a lion
Y'all selling bullshit, I ain't buying
You should sell cocaine
Now a nigga rich off the rap game

She used to call me, now she blowing up my cellular
Rappers tried to play me, now I'm twenty steps ahead of 'em
Still independent, we just laughing at competitors
Worry 'bout a deal? We just 'bout these mills

If she tripping get the steppin', we don't tolerate complaining
