Double shots
Double bitches
Double chains
You could see 'em drippin'
Drip and go
I'm drippin' bitch
Let us fuck
Spill some shit
Drip, drip, drip
I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
She drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
Gettin' drippin'
Get drippin' bitch
Drip, drip, drip
I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
She drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
Let us fuck, spill some shit

Trained not to slip a thought
With you girl, all over my dick and balls
Can't somebody roll up, drippin'
Slippin' like it's all the night is ending
And the coma hands in the air gollum
I'm the lord of rings, drippin' and go
Looking like Coby, bitches think flyin' out
Bitch I think I'm fucking solar
Saved my ego pig now I say it's fucking bulldog
Barn, now come and give me head and
Shut your fucking know it
Ah, she say she don't play that
She just say 'till I hit it doggy style
They'll be payback, throwing money like a payroll
You ain't gotta gas me
You shut this motherfucker down last week
Take a swing

Double shots
Double bitches
Double chains
You could see 'em drippin'
Drip and go
I'm drippin' bitch
Let us fuck
Spill some shit
Drip, drip, drip
I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
She drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
Gettin' drippin'
Get drippin' bitch
Drip, drip, drip
I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
She drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
Let us fuck, spill some shit

I see some double D's
I'm double taking
She with a friend
Double teaming
Bottom's up
Why your face down
Now bring your head back
Like you ain't trying to drown
How many drinks you had
I think I lost count
One, two wasted
Ice gutter crap
In this bitch, Criss-cross
Jumping on the couch
Now bring that cookie over here
Like a girl scout
Drippin' everywhere
Ball of chains, pull mody
Feelin' like money
Take a picture, say cheese
You were talking to an animal
Piss like Dr. Dolittle
You wanted me
But I think that I see two way

Double shots
Double bitches
Double chains
You could see 'em drippin'
Drip and go
I'm drippin' bitch
Let us fuck
Spill some shit
Drip, drip, drip
I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
She drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
Gettin' drippin'
Get drippin' bitch
Drip, drip, drip
I'm drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
She drippin'
Drip, drip, drip
Let us fuck, spill some shit
