[Intro]
Yeah, whoop

[Chorus]
Ah ah aw yeah
You can tell em that it's aw yeah
Came through deep, everybody's all here
You ain't got to count it cause the money's all there, aw yeah

[Verse 1]
Aw yeah, tell 'em it'w my year
Tell 'em it's my life ,it's more than a career
I was made for it, paid for it, slaved for it
Third times a charm, so I went and bought a chain for it
Alumni, dumb high, you know what it is
West side, Bat Gang, all up in this bitch
Got my wheels up, take off, how many more I got to break off?
Show y'all that I ain't soft, think I might go AWOL
Still I rest no stress, come alive from the S.L.S
Front line nigga fuck who next, head shots, fuck your vest
Case closed I'm killing the game, everybody feeling the same
Grab an umbrella cause you 'bout to feel my rain

[Chorus]
Aw yeah
You can tell them it's aw yeah
Came through deep, everybody's all here
You ain't got to count it cause the money's all there, aw yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah
You can tell 'em that it's aw yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 2]
Aw, think I'm 'bout to do it, rest of y'all coming up short like chewy
Lately I've been on my greatness, this is just the basics, so just sit back and wait
But if you think you want some, come try, you know what I'm on
Got my dog pound, one bitch, bad to the bone
Can't get this at no outlet, outfit ain't out yet
I'm on one, two blunts, tell them we auction
Aw yeah, nothing but stars here, we 'bout to call out 2,3 Tarheels
No you can't fuck with my team, you already know the dream
Baby let me hear you scream

[Chorus]
Aw yeah
You can tell them its aw yeah
Came through deep, everybody's all here
You ain't got to count it cause the money's all there, aw yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah
You can tell em that it's aw yeah, aw yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah ah aw yeah, yeah, yeah
You can tell em that it's aw yeah, aw yeah
