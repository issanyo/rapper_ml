[Verse 1: Vee Tha Rula]
Uh, little nigga but my heart not little
Baggy jeans tryna put some knots in them
Murder Mitten where them niggas pop pistols
Gun Ru, I was born in Blodgett Hospital, uh
Momma workin' like a slave then she whip it in the kitchen
Puttin' chicken on a plate man
Told her we gone make it out cause there's rats all in the basement
Niggas' shooting by my house man
Weekends over at Granny's
She got everybody drinkin'
But the young-ins gettin' older though, uh
And over here we grow up gangstas
Everyday and every night niggas dyin' left and right
Ain't no future for a young nigga
Then we left without my father and we moved to Arizona
But just know a nigga do it for the town

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Real niggas' in the city know I hold the shit down
For the
You know I do it for the town
For the
Know I hold the shit down

[Verse 2: Vee Tha Rula]
Uh, came to Phoenix feelin' like we made it
Palm trees and shit this shit's amazing
Same struggle nigga different pavement
Feelin' like a outcast no Andre baby
Momma put me in a better school
Like I could learn some things I never knew
Then I met this nigga Danny Q
Put me on an ounce I started movin'
Well niggas gunnin' for me so I'm shootin'
Like what we move from Ma I'm still gon' do it
I’m a thug it’s in my blood I met R.A. from Black WallStreet
And I started banging Blood too
Nigga you can get these drugs too
Nigga clean but I get it out the mud too
Hustlin' hard you can tell gettin' paper like the mail (knock knock)
Goin' to jail

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Real niggas' in the city know I hold the shit down
For the
You know I do it for the town
For the
Know I hold the shit down

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Ink]
You ain't gotta trip
Uh Baby
I'm doin' what I gotta do to put the city on for real
Uh baby
Feel like the freshest mutha fucka right before you break the seal

[Verse 3: Vee Tha Rula]
Now they tryin' to sell my tapes to try to bail me out
Sit inside these walls and see what hell about
I ain't sentenced but my sentences is my help me out
Got out and start kicking shit like Johnny Cage
I'm ready and I'm horny I could fuck a bitch a hundred ways
I'm keepin' it 100
You don't like the script then turn the page
I'm killin' every record
In the streets respecting
Just before the gold before the "A" up on my necklace
I'm goin' more than gold I'm causin' mayhem cause I'm next
And then I made that out it Paris
Then Alumni started reppin'
Now I'm sliding' through street cause I'm the man no second guessing
My two cities know I got em' not a question

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Real niggas' in the city know I hold the shit down
For the
You know I do it for the town
For the
Know I hold the shit down

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Ink]
You ain't gotta trip
Uh Baby
I'm doin' what I gotta do to put the city on for real
Uh baby
Feel like the freshest mutha fucka right before you break the seal
