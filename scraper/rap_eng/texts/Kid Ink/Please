[Hook x2]
Please don't hate on me
Please don't hate on me
Please, I know I shine
So bright

[Verse 1]
Uh, they mad cause I'm shining, can't see what the time is
I ain't worried about comments, more worried 'bout when the money coming
Found money when I show up and I'm about to blow it all like I roll up
Geico Sonar, make this shit look easier than Rosa, ha
Smell the aroma, one hit will put you in a coma
All my brothers with me like Jonas, and I paint a perfect picture like Mona
Yeah, that good, and you ain't gotta tell me that I rap good
I'm just tryna stay humble, it's kinda hard when you shine like the sun though

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah and you can never shame me, I got them going nuts, praline
You know it's going down, cave in, don't worry where I'm from, I'm an alien
And we ain't in the same league, Alumni, we the A-Team
You can find me anywhere the grass grow, face that, we don't even pass those
Toast to the assholes, shit, you can smell it with the bad clothes
Break down, roll up
Burn one, roaster, speeding through the city in a roadster
Bad bitch you can put her on a poster
No I am not a poser, so bright I can shine like I'm supposed to

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, sun high, come close, might need sun block
You know I got the loud, turnt up, click, pow, gun shot
Going over niggas heads like a home run, ain't tricking I don't wanna get your hopes up
Money put 'em under hypnosis, you rap too? We ain't even notice
I ain't even tryna play that, messing up my high, where the maid at?
Gotta stay fly, can't land, headed to the sky, Amen
Shine, Ray Bans, it's nothing like money, it's the fragrance
Ball like Magic Irving, all you gotta do is say the magic word

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, I said you better get your shades on
You better get your shades out, shine
You know what it is when we come round
All my niggas shine with the sun down
On a high, don't try to come down
Don't get lost boy, Batgang like I roll with the lost boys
