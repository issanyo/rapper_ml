[Hook x2]
I know, I know, that you ain't never got down like this before
Fa sho, come here I can show you what it is
All you gotta do is keep up, we could get it in
All you gotta do is keep up

[Verse 1]
Okay, I know, I know, you ain't gotta fix your lips (ah)
Seen you round before (ah), ain't your first time, no
Okay, I know, I know you ain't never did it like this
All these drinks all gotta go (ah), still taking shots, I can't miss
Okay, let's go, let's go, roll up that Bombay
Bucket list full of Rose, a lil Patron, and OJ
But we don't need no chasin, you can turn up the whole thing
Girl vibrate that ass here and turn off your phone ring
L-l-low key, came in here, so deep
Trying to come sit at my table, ain't no room like a two seater
I'm sorry, but your friend gotta move, bitch is too needy
Ain't no hard feelings, you can fill her up, it's okay

[Hook x2]
I know, I know, that you ain't never got down like this before
Fa sho, come here I can show you what it is
All you gotta do is keep up, we could get it in
All you gotta do is keep up

[Verse 2]
Okay, I know, I know, you won't take no pics (ya)
Boyfriend know you here, but, he don't know who you with
Okay, I know, I know, you ain't here by yourself (nah)
Where the fuck are your friends, let's take all this back to the house
Okay, let's roll, let's roll, meet me in valet
Sunset to the freeway, just keep up for Pete's sake
Keep it one hundred I don't really need no foreplay
Just hit it from the back, girl, and pull on her hair like bad girls
Now, get right to it
Gone off that turn up fluid
Say she don't really get down like this
Little peer pressure just might do it
Playing undercover if I lay you under covers
Bet you learn something new
Chest to chest, make a move

[Hook x2]
I know, I know, that you ain't never got down like this before
Fa sho, come here I can show you what it is
All you gotta do is keep up, we can get it in
All you gotta do is keep up
