[Hook]
Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, it don’t make no sense
Tried to tell you before not to lose yourself
Don’t you worry I’ll be here when its no one left
Tell you what it is, everybody ain’t a friend
Watch them change like a pen, I’ll be here when its no one left
Put your mind in the game, call up on what they say
You forgot about the plan
Tried to tell you not to lose yourself

[Verse 1]
Uh, sitting back, talking to myself
Been a long way around like Buddha’s belt
Remember when, these lames wouldn’t fuck with me
Track star, now they all tryin’ to run with me
Friend or foe, you never know
It’s a blind game, be in the way you going
Get your mind right, and leave the left overs
Got the weight of an entire team on my shoulders
So I showed them I’m everything the world may
Tryin’ to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Please
Don’t you get it twisted like a whirlwind
I will never change, never change ’till the fucking end
TruTV, all these niggas so pretend in your face
Complimenting when they really know they spend every day
Talking shit yeah it smells like a mouthful
Hotter that I get, these niggas colder than the South Pole

[Hook]
Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, it don’t make no sense
Tried to tell you before not to lose yourself
Don’t you worry I’ll be here when its no one left
Tell you what it is, everybody ain’t a friend
Watch them change like a pen, I’ll be here when its no one left
Put your mind in the game, call up on what they say
You forgot about the plan
Tried to tell you not to lose yourself

[Verse 2]
What’s happenin’? Can you tell me what happened
Is it fame over passion, seem a little distracted
In a couple situations you ain’t used to
Now look around pay attention it ain’t no discounts
These niggas is selling souls for their name on a cloud
Don’t you worry about me, bitch I came for the doubt
I’m so concrete
Two feet to the ground
About to fuck shit up
But I came into town
Think you need to slow it down
Tryin’ to run shit
Lost in the sauce, get a compass
High off life, barely even conscious
Livin’ in a dream, you forgot what it means to
Not have a thing from a block full of fiends
These streets are a monster
Happy Halloween
Now I’m knocking at your door
With a mask on
Feeling like this life
Isn’t everything you asked for

[Hook]
Now you walking around like you hot to death
Really four below, it don’t make no sense
Tried to tell you before not to lose yourself
Don’t you worry I’ll be here when its no one left
Tell you what it is, everybody ain’t a friend
Watch them change like a pen, I’ll be here when its no one left
Put your mind in the game, call up on what they say
You forgot about the plan
Tried to tell you not to lose yourself

[Outro]
I say you fucking with the man now
Yeah, yeah
Must've forgoten 'bout the plan now
Somebody tell 'em
