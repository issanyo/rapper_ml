I might walk in the club
Leave with the whole party
See the light in my eyes
We just getting it started
Had alot on my mind
But, it's time to let it go
Right now, right now, right now
I'm somebody
I might walk in the club
Leave with the whole party
See the light in my eyes
We just getting it started
Had alot on my mind
But, it's time to let it go
Right now, right now, right now
I'm somebody

I might walk in a room
Take all the attention
Young bad motherfucker
Graduated from detention
Told you we would've make it far
I'm a 'bout to push it to the limit
Throw my sign in the air
Like it's a picket in this bid
I might come through
Shining like the sun roof
Down for whatever whenever
As if this drink or this medical
Got me spilling invisible
When the city a million
I swear these haters can't see me
I know for sure they gon' feel it
We going bottle through bottle
Sipping like it's Dasani
Whole table of models
Came straight from pilates
They say the life that we live
Ain't made for everybody
In a world to see you
With my girlfriend in a mali

I might walk in the club
Leave with the whole party
See the light in my eyes
We just getting it started
Had alot on my mind
But, it's time to let it go
Right now, right now, right now
I'm somebody
I might walk in the club
Leave with the whole party
See the light in my eyes
We just getting it started
Had alot on my mind
But, it's time to let it go
Right now, right now, right now
I'm somebody

I'm a step in, 20 on the guestlist
No question, they know me up it up
On a regular confessions of a rock star
Headin' to the bar
Taking shots like an outlaw
Won't feel it till tomorrow
Damn, I might roll out
Meet me in a valley
Let's take it back to the house
Party like we kid and play
The night has just begun
Moon's up, howl back
We been going hard
Show you who ain't really about that
Like pouring shot for shots
All in your camera posing
We making the scene
And I might be rolling
Two red cups and I just can't get enough
You better make sure your chick's tough
'Cause we about to turn it up

I might walk in the club
Leave with the whole party
See the light in my eyes
We just getting it started
Had alot on my mind
But, it's time to let it go
Right now, right now, right now
I'm somebody
I might walk in the club
Leave with the whole party
See the light in my eyes
We just getting it started
Had alot on my mind
But, it's time to let it go
Right now, right now, right now
I'm somebody

I might walk in the club
Said I might walk in walk in
Said I might walk in, turn it up
Everybody in here gonna turn to us
So we about to get it poppin'
Keep it going ain't no stopping

I might walk in the club
Leave with the whole party
See the light in my eyes
We just getting it started
Had alot on my mind
But, it's time to let it go
Right now, right now, right now
I'm somebody
