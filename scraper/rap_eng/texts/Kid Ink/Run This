[Verse 1]
You don't want none with this, not only do I run but I lunge this shit
Smoke like I don't need lungs and shit, spit lit like two rubbing sticks
Wipe me down, better call Charmin, cuff yo chick kid so charming
I'mma make my way in Marlin, hit it and she gon' come back, karma
It's murder better call the coroner, they ain't wanna let me in they circle so I corner
When I'm done baby you can go on an put a fork in 'em, don't talk money then you sound like a foreigner
In my limelight I'm the sun of you, any list I'm the one and number two
No restroom, up all night, check the bottom of my shoes I don't walk I

[Hook]
Yeah, I got 'em, you know I
Leggo, yeah, I got 'em, you know I

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I say what I want no censor, paper getting real long like a center
To the money soon as I enter, we know you ain't getting paid, interns
Being fly as a pre-set, everything on froze reset
You can't fuck with me you just celibate, with so many hoes mother fucker I can sell a bitch
Sick fever, right upside the head treat the beat like Teila
Member when I use to work the scales like leavers? Rap now but I'm still ducking the Zebras
You can never pass me gon' just face it, riding that beat like a motherfucking bass hit
I don't give a fuck who you run with I know they know who run this shit

[Hook]
Kill 'em, aye, you know I
Go, uh
