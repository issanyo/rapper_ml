[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She got rid of a loser, you know to fuck with a winner
Man I roll up in the Rolls, to pick that ass up for dinner
I got the deluxe apartment, I mean we up in the sky
Put my bitch on the runway, she G5 fly
I got that paper to play with, now why the fuck would she stay with
A nigga bringing the down down, he was bringing it down
I put her up on game, now she won't fuck with a lame
Even if a nigga wave I tell, I got her like

New crib, new life on the map
