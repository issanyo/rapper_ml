See me grabbin' on my tooly

She told me smack her on the booty

She say I got too many hoes

She say I got too many shows

But she twerkin' Shawty gon' toss that pussy at me like an alley-oop

There's some bitches in this club, but ain't none as bad as you

With an ass as fat as yours, watch me make it thunder storm

Flyer than a G-6, come on shawty come aboard

You deserve an award or a trophy, I ain't jokin'

Looking at it from the front and I can see that ass pokin'

Out your dress

Thirty minutes have you coming out your dress

Spend a one night stand with me, make you change your address

Get it on the first night, baby, I ain't here to judge

Say you want that dope dick, I can be your plug

We can get it in this club, we can get it in the whip

First you gotta show them lips if you tryna get a tip

It's some big booty bitches in the building, ooh-wee

The way she clap her hands, the way she clap her booty

And I'm like "oh my God Becky, look at her butt"

Got called the trashman ‘cause she got some junk in her trunk

She put that arch in her back, she started throwing it back

You know I'm watching it wiggle, I let her grab on my missile

She say I'm fucking tonight, she let me know it's official

The way she sluprin' and twerkin' she might just get her a Birkins

Grabbing on that tooly, smackin' on that booty

I told her "twerk" she say "why" I say "why? because I'm Boosie"

I walked off in that club, walked up and I approached her

First she say I was a dog, now she twerkin' up in my Rover

Surfing up in my Rover, showing off like she supposed to

She ain't have to tell me smack her ass, I smacked it ‘fore she told me

Got too many hoes, I'm loaded, she twerk on the pole so perfect

Sassy mouth every time she talk, but she show me that she worth it

Twerk

She twerk it, she twerk, dropping that ass all the way to the dirt

You know she bad twerkin' it all in my pants, twerkin' it all in my shirt

Aww fuck, say she got a man, I'm like "so what?"

Toot it up for a real one with a million, oh yeah (okay)

I got her on that D'Usse

Told her pop that oochie coochie, smack her on the booty

Do it for the Vine, do it for the dollar sign

Pull them panties to the side, girl don't sigh

She twerkin', go ‘head, don't be nervous

Club hot, it's the furnace, I know your feet hurtin'

In them heels, so high, no lie for certain

Get away from them squares and throw that in a circle

See me grabbing on the booty, my goonies got the tooly

Said it's Kid Ink, baby, who the fuck is you confusing?

Bust it, bust it, bust it down bust it bus side of the Bendo

Used to be my old ho, now she acting brand new

Shawty from the hood, tell from her tattoo

Both sides go up, I just call her Lambo

Left, right, l-left, right I hit that Tina Ike

She drop down and twerk it and now I see the light
