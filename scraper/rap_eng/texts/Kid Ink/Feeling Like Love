[Chorus: Ray J]
It's feeling like love, wouldn't you agree?
Top down in the coupe, rolling through the D
We met up in the club, drunk as can be
But when it's real love, can feel it real deep

[Bridge: Ray J]
Uh, whippin' through the D
I mix the lean with the peach
I bust a U'ie in the street right now
Yellin', "Fuck the police"
Niggas say they don't know me right now
But girl got me on a leash
And I put that pimpin' shit down
And fell in love with a queen

[Chorus: Ray J & (Kid Ink)]
And it's feeling like love, wouldn't you agree? (Oh yeah)
Top down in the coupe, rolling through the D (top down, rolling)
We met up in the club, drunk as can be (uh-huh) (we met in the club)
But when it's real love, can feel it real deep (uh) (it's real love, baby, can feel it real deep)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
It's Kid Ink
I said this feelin' brand new
I ain't talk to my homies in a week, aw yeah
She just got my name tattooed on her
And I just put her name on the lease, aw yeah
I wake up to her face and
Fell like I just hit the game winner (swish)
She a lady when she round you
When she round me, it's freaky behavior (ow)
Ain't need men, so we fly forever (yeah)
Ain't the same if we ain't high together (naw)
I don't know if your wine or my eyes are redder
Top down, it's the kind of weather
I been on the grind and my calender full
But you always get the tellin', baby
Every time I dive in it, feel like a pool
Baby, all I can say is

[Chorus: Ray J]
And it's feeling like love, oh, wouldn't you agree?
Top down in the coupe, rolling through the D
I remember when we met up in the club, we were drunk as can be
But when it's real love, can feel it real deep

[Post-Chorus: Ray J]
If you got that good love
Say oh, yeah, yeah
If you got that good love
Say oh, yeah, yeah
If you're feeling real love
Say oh, yeah, yeah
If you got that good, good love
Say oh, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Ray J]
Uh, whippin' through the D
I mix the lean with the peach
Top down in the street right now
I got [?]
Niggas say you don't come 'round now
But girl got me on a leash
And I'm 'bout to have a baby right now
And I get it with a queen

[Chorus: Ray J & (Kid Ink)]
And it's feeling like love, oh, wouldn't you agree?
I had to let the top down in the coupe, rolling through the D (yeah, skrrt)
I remember when we met up in the club, and we was turnt up, we were drunk as can be
But when it's real love, I know you feel my love real deep, can feel it real deep

[Post-Chorus: Ray J]
If you got that good, good love
Say oh, yeah, yeah
If you got that good, good love
Say oh, yeah, yeah
If you feel like making love
Say oh, yeah, yeah
And when you get that good love
Scream oh, yeah, yeah
