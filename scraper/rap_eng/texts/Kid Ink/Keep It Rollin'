[Hook]
I said go and put your lighters up, what you smoking?
You can smell it over there and back, ain't even open
With your girlfriend getting high
And we floating, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling, said I'm tryna smoke another one
Just keep it rolling baby, just keep it rolling
You ain't gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

[Verse 1]
You would think that it was Christmas how I got her open
You can see it in her poker face, I got her folding
Baby girl if you getting high, I got the potion
Now them hoes ain't choosing, nigga I'm already chosen
I ain't blind I can see you hate, I keep it rolling
They just mad cause they not here and I'm the opposite of cold
And I'm getting fast money, yeah the opposite of codeine
At the table tryna get another bottle from that hostess
With a pocket full of Trojans, you can call me Roman
Kid Ink the entertainer they be wishing and they hoping that
I'mma take her home cause this the after party
Get turnt up we already got started

[Hook]
I said go on put your lighters up (what you smoking)
You can smell it over there, back (ain't even open)
With your girlfriend getting high
And we smoking, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling (been tryna smoke another one)
Just keep it rolling babe
Just keep it rolling babe
You ain't gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

[Verse 2]
I ain't ever gon' stop no, I keep it going
Walking like a giant, fi-fye-foing
Tatts everywhere, scarface Lil Tony
They don't ever tell me no, they say yes like Lil Corey
And I'm smoking on some good, euphoric
Put my CD in and she gon' like you for it
Kid Ink baby, say hi to the bad guy
Only one year and I ain't nothing like the last guy
In the club, it's alright
We can leave, we ain't gotta stay all night
Know, it's OG waiting back home
Lil kid you can feel it in your back bone

[Hook]
I said go on put your lighters up (what you smoking)
You can smell it over there, back (ain't even open)
With your girlfriend getting high
And we smoking, making movies with the cameras on
Just keep it rolling baby
Just keep it rolling (been tryna smoke another one)
Just keep it rolling babe
Just keep it rolling babe
You ain't gotta turn the cameras off, just keep it rolling

[Outro]
I don't know about you, but I'm living in the moment
You can hate if you want but I'mma keep it rolling
Gotta super bad bitch feeling like Seth Rogen
Making movies all night, just keep it rolling babe

[*spoken*] this the part when you get your lighters out,put them in the air just keep it rolling baby
