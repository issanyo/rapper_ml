[Verse 1]
Yeah
Okay, neva gave a fuck, prolly never will
Rollin', ridin' till the muthafuckin' wheel fall off
Yeah, I be in this muthafucka still, ballin', bitch this ain't no muthafuckin' drill
Call it Kid Ink baby, if you ain't know that
Niggas tryna steal my swag, need a Lojack
Walkin' round this bitch, no shirt like Conan
Leanin' off the codeine, that's why I'm moving slowly
So sorry for the trouble, baby drop it like a fumble
And, I'mma make it rain, feel like spring in the summer
Hell nah, It ain't nothing, Goin' in like a button
Take a second, You hear me buzzin'?
Bitch you know I-

[Verse 2]
Uh, shawty on my dick, tryna cop a feel
Better cuff yo' chick, Goin' for the steal
She been lookin' at a nigga like a muthafuckin' meal
Signin' titties all night, still I won't sign a deal
Aww, yeah, Tell me what you know bout
Tryna keep it real but my show already sold out
Uh, white girls everywhere I go now
Party over here but we can take it to the house
Shawty ring my bell, can't knock my hustle
It's Alumni, Batgang bitch to the rubble

With my middle finger up in the air, Yeah

[Hook]
Neva gave a fuck, neva, neva gave a fuck
