[Hook: Kid Ink]
Man, ever since the first time, first time
I got a taste of the life that I live
Man, ever since the first time, the first time
I ever seen so much money like this
I knew that it was no turning back
It’s no turning back
It’s no turning back
Now
I knew that it was no turning back
It’s no turning back
It’s no turning back
Now
You can tell ‘em that

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Never had no doubt
Made it through the city
They said it’s no way out
But I don’t need no pity
Baby, I just need some ones
Tryin’ to pitch it underhand
If you tryin’ to have some fun
Girl I’m with you, understand
That it’s nothin’ when you bossin’ up
Know the alley you barkin’ up
Kill the scene and chalk it up
This OG that I’m coughing up
Got me high, ain’t no service here
Certified my second year
Bitches love Alumni, in case you were unaware
There ain’t no need to front, and there ain’t no turnin’ back
Got my back against the wall, but I’m ready for attack
And your bitch is on my drawers, but I don’t let it go to my head
See me runnin’ on them mills, I just let them bitches tread


[Hook: Kid Ink]


[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
I’m yankin’, four or five bitches for the takin’
You jelly-ass niggas what’s shakin?
In the kitchen I’m bakin’
I’m whippin’ like I’m on a plantation
Man, the rap game crazy but that phone game
Man, that phone game crazy, that phone game would save me
When a nigga ain’t have no cheese
And I was orderin’ them Samsungs
They 350 – “Damn, young man, how you got it go sewn up?
You was a little homie now you grown up
It’s murder, murder, bodybags with the toe tags
You niggas wearin’ all black be lookin’ so sad
I’m back, lookin’ even more pretty, more handsome
My whole city know it’s Rock, Mariani to the socks

[Hook: Kid Ink]


[Outro]
No turnin’ back
No turnin’ back
No turnin’ back
No turnin’ back
No turnin’ back
No turnin’ back now
