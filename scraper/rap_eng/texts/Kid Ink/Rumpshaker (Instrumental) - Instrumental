You got that
Racks in effects, rumpshaker
I just wanna see you move your moneymaker
Get stupid let me see you act a fool with it
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do with it
What you gonna do
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do with it
What you gonna do
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do with it

What you gonna do...

What you gonna, uh

It's 11: 45 at night
Just started my day
Looking for the party
Work hard to play
Go, Walk in the club
Lights all over the place
But these haters can't see me
'Cause your ass all in my way
That cake, cake
Let me get a taste
I don't need a plate
Eat it with my face
Just keep it real
Give a fuck if it's fake
As long as it's round
Not pointy like a stake
Uh, yeah you got it
But what you gonna do with it
Just one song come and give me 2 minutes
Please don't be mad if I grab it
Get it from your momma and your granny

You got that
Racks in effects, rumpshaker
I just wanna see you move your moneymaker
Get stupid let me see you act a fool with it
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do with it
What you gonna do
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do with it
What you gonna do
Get stupid let me see you act a fool
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do

We, up late like the sand-man
Let me take a seat back
Think I need a lap dance
Lost in a trance
I can barely take my eyes off
Stuck like glue, make it work
No time-off
With them fat ass and them C cups
Bouncing like Bay Watch
Nicky from her butt down
Can't fit in them jeans much
Twerk sumthin, if you back it up
Might hurt some
Where you get all that from
I'm ready for the show
Act 1
Now Have fun, shots come
You can have two
Tryin' hop on it
But I think I need a sec though
You thick like sizzurp and I'm lit
Like a matchbox, Gona throw it up
Ba-donka-donk you can meet me at the black top

You got that, B-Ballin!
Racks in a effects, rumpshaker
I just wanna see you move your moneymaker
Get stupid let me see you act a fool with it
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do with it
What you gonna do
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do with it
What you gonna do
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do with it
What you gonna do
Get stupid let me see you acting fool with it
Yeah you got it girl but what you gonna do
