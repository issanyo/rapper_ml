[Kid Ink]
Yup
You said
[Hook]
Said it's the same shit, different day
These niggas talk, like the fucking gay
I don't care, I only talk to bitches
But if they come and ask just tell them that I mentioned
Fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um, pause
Fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um, pause
Fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um, pause
Fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um, pause
Fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um fuck 'um, pause
Yea, I said it's Kid Ink baby, taking shots with your lady
Body like a Mercedes, ass think as grandma's gravy
Give a fuck about your feelings nigga, save that shit for debbie
Uh, all I smoke is that fire, and bitch all I spit is that (kensing?)
About to barbecue you niggas well, you know with out no drama
Taking shots at your head till you look like Ronald McDonald
And, full stereo nigga, it's no mono y mono
Bars kicking like I'm Ryu, feel that 16 hit combo
When it comes to smelling that money, got a nose like I'm Ganzo
And my bitch yea she bad, got her hair like Rapunzel
Talk that shit if you want, I got ears like I'm Dumbo
I don't care if you whispering, nigga I can hear you mumble it ain't nothing
