[Intro: Future]
This that Justin Credible. The sound nigga this. You don't know how to ball like this, yeah. Astronaut Status, Freebandz. Eyyy, woah!

[Hook: Future]
You don't know what it takes to ball like this do ya?
They don't know what it takes to ball like this do they?
You don't know what it takes to ball like this do you?
You don't know what it takes to ball like this (like this)
We turned up in here with all the girls in the VIP
We got money on us, we bout to order up them bottles
Hold on, we gone order up them bottles
Got girls on girls in girls

[Verse 1: Future]
European my wardrobe, done flooded out my AP
Michael Jordans on red bottoms, got red bottoms on Balenciaga
All the girls that roll with me, they either R&B or thot models
I'm in the major leagues like the NBA
I'm in the new car and I ain't tryna race
It's a new Porsche, new Rovers, new Phantoms
And we makin' movies, no cameras
Private parties, you on the guest list
I'm sippin' on that Ace of Spades, I'm drankin' on that Texas

[Hook: Future]

Hold on, we gone order up them bottles
Got girls on girls in girls

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Order up, gettin' contraband across the border
Bad bitch look like I import her
Treat my dick like a recorder
I had to stop tellin' niggas where I get my clothes
Had to tell 'em if you dab then don't let it out your nose
I love her, I fuck her
You cuff her, you love her, you fuck but don't trust her
She runnin' for cover
She fuckin' for bucks but you bustin' a nut for her
Shame, Keenen Ivory Wayans
Call you from a flight, I'm gettin' service on the plane
Young Khalifa

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
You don't know what it's like
Sippin' champagne every night
No, ain't no celebration, on the road every night
No, we ain't on vacation man, this duffle bag is my life
Bout to smoke out this ho-tell me where the fuck is my light?
Nah, we ain't talkin' no hype
This everything it look like
Then throwin' money like rice
Throwin' like it's to Jerry Rice
Said Rollies tell me where the time go
Champagne, Patron, that's my combo
Livin' in the club like it's my condo
Walk in shoes you ain't never gon' find so go
