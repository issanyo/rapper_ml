Eye should see me wearin' all this gold
Nigga I'm cold

Uh, I already know
Walk in this bitch
Got your chick's face froze
Its a white kinda night
I ain't talkin' bout snow
Goin' straight to the shots
Let a nigga unload
Nigga I'm cold, nigga I'm cold
Champagne on ice, sippin' on Rose
Standin' on the couch, never trippin' on toes
Waitress here cuz we tippin' them hoes
There's enough guap, it'll go around
Nigga VIP, I'm a pro now
Was a freshman playin' in the pros now
Lay a mothafucka down like post out
You know how it go now
Its like its a mothafuckin' ghost town
See a lot of hoes round
You better get your bitches [?]

Mr. Fuck You
What you wanna do, what I mean it man
Say my iron low but I ain't a God damn bulimic
Wife beater and a bandanna
Bitch I'm Hulk Hogan
Whole team with the shit
Tell a bitch to bust it open
Bust it down, pack it up, put it on her, bust her open
Tell her bring that money back on the first thing smokin'
Skinny nigga, bi-polar
Give a bitch the cold shoulder
Game over lame I told ya
We ain't playin that shit
Fuck skinny nigga trippin'
We ain't boys
Bitch listen for that love
Get the first round easy
