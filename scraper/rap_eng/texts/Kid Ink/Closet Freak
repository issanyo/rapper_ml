[Intro]
Yeah, girl we can chill
Get you to the crib, show you how I live
Put on your favourite song, lay you on the bed
Do a couple things I know that you ain't doing with your man

[Hook]
Got her doing things she ain't doing with her man
Got her doing things she ain't doing with her man
Got her doing things she ain't doing with her man
Got her doing things she ain't doing with her man
She a closet freak, closet freak
Closet freak and I'mma bring her out
She a closet freak, closet freak
Closet freak and I'mma bring her out tonight

[Verse 1]
Said I'mma bring her out, bail bonds
Beat it up, like some alpines
Just take another shot, foul line
Energy like I'm running on some alkalines
Posing shins like pilates
Tase her too, she can feel it in her body
It's getting hot in here, just catch a tan
Cause girl I got a plan, I know that you ain't doing with your man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cause baby he can't do it like I do
I know how to bring out a IQ
Good brain in the fast lane
So we don't play games like [?]
We from the ceiling to the floor
Got three things that you never did before
Eyes roll back, put her in a trance
See girl I got a plan, I know that you ain't doing with your man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Good girl gone bad know you heard of her
We wake the neighbours up, Disturbia
Got the lights off, no sheets
Headboard kno-knocking like the police
Cartwheels and handstands
Shit you never did with your last man
Don't got to say it again
But girl I got a plan, I know that you ain't doing with your man

[Hook]
