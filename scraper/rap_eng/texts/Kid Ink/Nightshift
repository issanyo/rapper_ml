[Hook]
I see you, yeah, I see you over there
And you got my attention like you sick so over there
I swear, your body is so priceless
Girl, I could work you, will you let me get the night shift?
The night shift, I'mma clock in
Then hit it like I'm tryna get employee of the year
I said I'll never quit, but girl you so fire
Just tell me what I gotta do to get me hired

[Verse 1]
Uh, and I'mma take you higher, you need a background check, I got some priors
But I could work you all night, I hope you ready girl cause I'mma need some overtime
All right, start on the call right, full shift, I'm never on strike
We could get the bed rocking, you ain't seen nothing yet, baby I just clocked in

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm down, for anything you into, bring a friend, we can have a group interview
Take it off, don't worry 'bout the dress code, give you the business girl, just be professional
Uh, just let me know, I work you out real late like a twenty-four
Yeah, no resume necessary, I'm on my job baby, you could be the secretary

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Call me, twenty-four hours girl I'm open and I'mma get in it like I'm tryna get a bonus
Ah, I'm tryna get up on it, all night, you gon' call off in the morning
In the morning you gon' have to call off in the morning
Cause I'mma have you so tired, clean the desk like you just got fired

[Hook]
