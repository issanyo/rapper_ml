[Chorus: Kyle Christopher]
I don't have time to read your mind, girl just keep it straight and tell me
What's your situation? What's your situation?
Did you come alone or are you coming home with me tonight?
You coming home girl, you coming home girl

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I think you should come alone girl, I don't wanna go alone so
Some with me cause I could use some company
And I ain't nothing like these wannabes
Baby there's only one of me
The ratio is one to three but you're the only one I see
We gon' tonight, I ain't tryna get stuck in the parking lot
Can't jut girl but we can walk it out
Let me show you what I'm talking 'bout

[Chorus: Kyle Christopher]
I don't have time to read your mind, girl just keep it straight and tell me
What's your situation? What's your situation?
Did you come alone or are you coming home with me tonight?
You coming home girl, you coming home girl

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
So tell me when you tryna leave girl
You ain't gotta act outta league
Cause we so major, so fresh
I don't need my make-up
Just do me one favour and keep it straight like shape-ups
I could be your saviour, tonight we don't need no labour
Cause we independent, one hit night, need an intervention
Naw I ain't tryna get offensive, I'm just tryna help you with your decision

[Chorus: Kyle Christopher]
I don't have time to read your mind, girl just keep it straight and tell me
What's your situation? What's your situation?
Did you come alone or are you coming home with me tonight?
You coming home girl, you coming home girl

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
It's only one situation left, Jersey Shore, DTF
I don't mean no disrespect, tryna leave before TMZ see us
You could stay the night, anything girl, just name the price
You a dime and I could change your life, Mac, make-up your mind
Let me take up your time
Feel me going up your spine
Now we could head out
Just tell 'em you're staying at your friend's house
[Chorus: Kyle Christopher]
I don't have time to read your mind, girl just keep it straight and tell me
What's your situation? What's your situation?
Did you come alone or are you coming home with me tonight?
You coming home girl, you coming home girl
