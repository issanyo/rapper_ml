[Hook]
Uhh speakers up, loud weed
Rollin in the back seat
Smokin on that loud seed
The clouds in my back seat
I just want that
I just want that
Money like an athlete
Say that I'm the realest nigga
Here if you ask me

[Verse 1]
Uhh, yea I'm on fire
Come and ash me
Just crept in feelin
Greater than your gatsby
You ain't gotta
You ain't gotta, gas me
High out the galaxy
No gravity
But I can feel her grabbin me
Shawty wanna little bit
Yeaa uhh take her home
Homicide
Kill that shit tempurpedic
I spill that shit still baby
You can feel that shit
Drippin down your legs
I'm about to go in I hope you
Ready for it

[Hook]
Uhhhh it ain't hard to tell
I gotta question for you
I ain't really into guessing
So just tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
This ain't nothin new
Baby you should come around more
We could have a good time
That's what she around for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down for
Tell me what you down
Fooooorrrr, yeaaaahhh
We can get into it

[Hook 2]
I tell her I said turn the speakers up
Now we don't give a fuck
Blunt lit one hit go me on some good shit
Bat tat tat batgang what it is bitch
Four Bâ€™s up you can tell' em big business

Uh, know we run it like spreets
Bet a hunit that your mans he can't do it like this
Bet his wrist ain't blueish like crips
Rozay blood gang, take a sip & a sue
Damn you got me talking crazy, looking for some action, let conversation
Acting like you basic, you knew when you wore that, that I was gonna holla
So baby girl just call back, I need all that, now

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, we can get into it (x3)
Egh

Gon' get into girl, SHOW ME HOW YOU DO IT UGH
