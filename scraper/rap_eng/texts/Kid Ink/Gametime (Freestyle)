[Intro: Kid Ink]
Gametime
Yeah, you know it's Gametime
I can show you that we ain't lyin'
It's Gametime
Yeah, it's Gametime
Fuck them niggas on the bench, it's playing time

[Verse: Kid Ink]
Now, who'd ever thought I will make it this far
Just wanted heaven on Earth
Feel like I made it to Mars
Know that we shootin' for somethin'
Maybe the stars
Maybe the drinks
Maybe your broads
Face, faced you niggas is frontin' and fake it in my fuckin' tv a plot
Think that you make any close
But just to see the mirage
I ain't even feel it, your watch from The Pill did the kickin' like it was a lash
Feelin' if I get from scissors inside of a elevator man I see 'em or not
Zero for zero I hit you by doubles just tryin' to even it out
I swear if you don't feel like you gon' die tonight
Then you ain't even alive
Swear if you ain't be puttin' in work, then you don't get a piece of the pie
But take it the look at the piece on my wrist and you know it's Gametime

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's Gametime
It's Gametime
Takin' it from the top (top)
Takin' one for my block to you
Takin' from you, won't stop no
It's Gametime
It's Gametime

[Outro: Bricc baby & Kid Ink]
Three shots, it's Gametime
Goin' out for Briccs, it's Gametime
Pass at me like it's Gametime
MVP, it's Gametime
