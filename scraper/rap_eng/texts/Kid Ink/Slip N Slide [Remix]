[Intro: Kid Ink, Saca, & Jonn Hart]
Yeah, Woah, Ok

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Have you dripping like rain girl
You ain't even tripping got a man girl
Cause I be straight hittin' in the paint girl
Does my thang
I ain't gon' play no games
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide

[Verse 1: Saca]
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I'ma make it drip, e-every day and night
Call me up when you want, it don't matter the time
I'ma hit it so good, have you feelin' alright
Feelin' alright, f-feelin' alright
Feelin' so good, we gon' do it all night
Gotta tell you this, it gon' be a fun night
I'ma keep on goin' until the sunrise
When the sun come up, I be on my grind
If you wanna fuck, I can make some time
You can come along, while I'm makin' cash
If you want it long, I-I'ma make it splash

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Have you dripping like rain girl
You ain't even tripping got a man girl
Cause I be straight hittin' in the paint girl
Does my thang
I ain't gon' play no games
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Now I can make it slip, and slide
Get you wet one sip, at a time
Now shawty wanna dip, in the ride
Talkin' to her like a pimp, but I tell ya no lie
Baby girl you the truth, soon as you wake up
Hollywood face with an ass from Decatur
Bay attitude little New York flavor
Everything to me, gon' show me what ya made of
I see you over there with your BF
Lesbi-honest no secrets
I got a seat wet, mean I got a seat sex, mean I got a seat less
See you at the exit

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Have you dripping like rain girl
You ain't even tripping got a man girl
Cause I be straight hittin' in the paint girl
Does my thang
I ain't gon' play no games
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide

[Bridge: Jonn Hart]
Me and you girl, in my room girl
You know what we gon do (gon do)
Grabbin' on my pillow, its bout' 4 in the morn
And we home all alone
I'll make you drip all night long

[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Have you dripping like rain girl
You ain't even tripping got a man girl
Cause I be straight hittin' in the paint girl
Does my thang
I ain't gon' play no games
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
I can make it slip, I can make it slide
