[Intro: Kid Ink]
Uh, it ain't nothing like a
Yea
It's a different kind of trust when I see you got that
Yea

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I know it's a different kind of love but ain't nothing like a
Tattoo of my name, tattoo of my name on you
It's just a different kind of trust when I see you got that
Tattoo of my name, tattoo of my name on you
Forever and ever, we're tied together, forever, with a tattoo of my name on you
Forever and ever, we're tied together, forever, with a tattoo of my name on you

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah, it makes everything official
It don't matter whether it's the first, last or initial
On that ass, legs, lower back of that wedding ring finger
I appreciate you just for representing me
Love and the pain, can't believe you was sitting through it
Friends tried to tell you that you crazy, don't you listen to 'em
We got something special baby, body better than mercedes
Picture tatted up, I swear I won't be mad at you
Going hard, don't be soft, fuck a flower, get my name on yo chest
It ain't never going nowhere like a stain on a white T
I think that you might be, the closest to wifey
Ain't nothing that hide, everybody see

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I know it's a different kind of love but ain't nothing like a
Tattoo of my name, tattoo of my name on you
It's just a different kind of trust when I see you got that
Tattoo of my name, tattoo of my name on you
Forever and ever, we're tied together, forever, with a tattoo of my name on you
Forever and ever, we're tied together, forever, with a tattoo of my name on you

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I would never tell you girl to go mess up yo frame
But it's nothing I could say about a tattoo of my name
Right there on that spot I see every time you change
Let me know it ain't no game, got me fuckin with you insane
They sayin it's my turn but I don't know if it's much room
Showin off to them other bitches, go and flex yo muscle
It's better than the rain, she said you high off of mushrooms
Still dripping wet, it's feeling like you gon' cum soon
You ain't gotta trip girl, I know where to aim at
Cock back, tryna hit it where my name at
It ain't nothing else you gotta say
I know the deal, it's pretty simple how you feel
Fuck that henna, keep it real

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I know it's a different kind of love but ain't nothing like a
Tattoo of my name, tattoo of my name on you
It's just a different kind of trust when I see you got that
Tattoo of my name, tattoo of my name on you
Forever and ever, we're tied together, forever, with a tattoo of my name on you
Forever and ever, we're tied together, forever, with a tattoo of my name on you

[Outro: Kid Ink]
It's nothing I could say about it
I would never tell you girl to go mess up yo frame
But it's nothing I could say about a tattoo of my name on ya
