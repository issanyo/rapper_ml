[Intro]
I know you can feel the movement, moving
I know you can feel the movement, moving

[Verse 1]
I know you can feel the movement, moving
It's nothing more than a movie
And this moment feel like 50, nothing but G's all in my unit
We built this from the roots, smell like trees all in my room
Fire cook the kush in the blunt, get out of the kitchen if itâ€™s too humid
The story that I could sell made way more money without the deal
But I'm doing this cause I dream big
And y'all already know who the team is
Never thought that we'd make it out
Grew up over where the fiends at
That's that thing that made me a man, swear y'all just act like females
If we talking bout numbers, really me and you don't speak well
Just go ahead wit yo mixtape
I'm killing it with my pre-sell
Hope you getting prepared, everybody here with me gon prevail
Stay suited, it's deeper than music

[Hook]
I know you can feel the movement, moving
See everybody around us, we built this from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving
Top speed, no stopping, losing's no option
Said I know you can feel the movement

[Verse 2]
Ducking the rules, high, stuck in the move
Don't look confused, everything coming in 2's
From 3 to 6 in the morning
What is she doing? Really don't care if you don't
Like what I'm on, to hell wit all yo complaints
I'm tryna stay humble and motivate
But let's celebrate, pour me a drink
Everything earned never concerned long as we grind
How do you skate?
All of these tats, all of this gold, stereotypes I'm tryna escape
I can see just why you relating
But in my mind nobody competing
Leaving behind the rearview chasing
Riding in my own lane just flexing
More ketchup, it ain't no pressure under pressure
Make sure to get my respect, waitress
Make sure everything is my just wants
These haters in the building keep booing
But ain't nobody gon do shit
We in this here just deeper than usual

[Bridge]
I know you can feel the movement, moving
I know you can feel the movement, moving
We ain't tryna hurt nobody
We ain't tryna hurt nobody

[Hook]
I know you can feel the movement, moving
See everybody around us, we built this from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving
Top speed, no stopping, losing's no option
Said I know you can feel the movement

[Verse 3]
Said I know you can feel the movement
Pull up, truck big as a mover, ain't nowhere to park
Backyard big as an amusement park
Come through looking like the million man march
My bad, I just had to brag one time
Hit em in the head with a brand new style
Closet full but there ain't no ties
Mouth full of gold, got a brand new smile
It ain't nothing new that these groupies been choosing
But we moving, better hold on, don't lose it

[Hook]
I know you can feel the movement, moving
See everybody around us, we built this from the ground up, damn
I know you can feel the movement, moving
Top speed, no stopping, losing's no option
Said I know you can feel the movement
