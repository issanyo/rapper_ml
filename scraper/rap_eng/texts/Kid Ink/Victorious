[Hook]
If I'm winning, the whole team winning, see?
If I'm winning, the whole team winning
If I'm hitting, the whole team hittin
If I'm hitting, the whole team hittin
Oh shit, my whole clique victorious
Oh shit, my whole clique victorious
Oh shit, my whole clique victorious

[Verse 1]
Okay - no shit, whole clique on like a light switch
Off that loud, I know you can hear the mic clip
Up real late with your girl on the night shift
Show her how to ride that dick, no license
I don't know rules, bitch, you're fucking with an outlaw
Ten deep, looks like I pulled up in a clown car
Ride for my dogs, couldn't do it without y'all
High as a kite, people tell me it's a downfall
If I'm winning, the whole team winning, see?
If I hit 'em both, the whole team understand
Girl chocolate, her best friend lemon head
No interviews, I'm talking in the bed
Finesse and Funk Master Flexin on em
See me taking shots like a Western
Up in the penthouse, you still in the Best Western

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Six feet deep, goin' down ain't an option
Too fly, kickin' down the door of your cockpit
Bottom of the map but money is the topic
Top of the world, you're looking microscopic
Straight up - I don't need no juice
Lil' sticky in the Swisher got 'em stuck like glue
No V-neck, nigga, just me and my crew
Drop a bomb on your head, got a pocket full of nukes
I lost my mind, shorty, let it all loose
Whole team gettin' in, she ain't even gotta choose
Tryna hang over here? Better off with a noose
Ol' hating-ass nigga, hit em off with a deuce
For really, I'm feeling like a milli'
Alumni, Bat Gang, LA is the city
That I'm reppin' the most, but on the East Coast
Tell em I'm good...
