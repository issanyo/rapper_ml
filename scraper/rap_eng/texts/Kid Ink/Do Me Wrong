[Intro]
Squat made the beat
Go Grizz
What you do me
What you do me

[Chorus]
Whatever you do, bitch, don't do me wrong
Got me second guessing, seen the message on your phone
Whatever you do, just don't do me wrong
Swear I'll lose my mind if I ever catch you, uh
Whatever you do, do me wrong
Just don't do me wrong
Whatever you do, do me wrong
Bitch, don't do me wrong

[Verse 1]
Just don't do me wrong
'Cause I might start a fight, leave your shit outside the home, yeah
Gucci long, yeah, go right up to the saloon, hey
Don't you say I'm acting like a child, bitch, I'm grown, yeah
They just got my mind twisted, got this blunt twisted
Took a sip out of the fifth
I been sitting, catching feelings
Been a minute since you hit me on the jet
If you tell me that I'm really trippin', I'ma fall back
No you ain't a bird, I ain't got bad taste
But I know we wasn't the best space
Ain't go throw you from no curbs 'til my facts straight
I can't let you run away and leave me last place

[Chorus]
Whatever you do, bitch, don't do me wrong
Got me second guessing, seen the message on your phone
Whatever you do, just don't do me wrong
Swear I'll lose my mind if I ever catch you, uh
Whatever you do, do me wrong
Just don't do me wrong
Whatever you do, do me wrong
Bitch, don't do me wrong

[Verse 2]
Wait, this what you want, later, I'ma undress ya
How could I be mad when that's the way that God blessed ya
Do you got a man? That's the number one question
Now I might just have to step right in the check shit (Bitch)
Hold up, wait, 'cause you wildin'
Touch my number one and you'll get 99 more problems
Violatin', we ain't comin' for no violence
Know I got the key on lock, I'm never drown
No more fishing for them hoes 'cause they piranhas
She too close, I tell her bluntly, get two rolling like Big Thomas
Baby girl, this a reminder who I was before you knew me
Don't let me find out, what you do me

[Chorus]
Whatever you do, bitch, don't do me wrong
Got me second guessing, seen the message on your phone
Whatever you do, just don't do me wrong
Swear I'll lose my mind if I ever catch you, uh
Whatever you do, do me wrong
Just don't do me wrong
Whatever you do, do me wrong
Bitch, don't do me wrong

[Outro]
Do me wrong
Do me wrong
Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm late to this shit, but
We 'bout to leave the club
I been tryin' to call you, I video called you
I don't really know what you want, but
Just don't do me wrong
Hit me back
