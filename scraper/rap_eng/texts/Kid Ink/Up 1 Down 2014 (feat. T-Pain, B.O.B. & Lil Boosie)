Pull up to the scene in an all white bucket
Way too high and I'm way too blunted (fuck it)
Fucked your bitch, told that ho she could suck it
Even in a knife fight bitch couldn't cut it
Young fresh nigga, I'm grey pouponin'
Why so sick by the time, might vomit
If I ain't the fliest then I ain't far from it
And if you gotta hold her hand that tight that ain't
Your woman
That's everyone woman, community pussy
You new to the game, you may lose like a rookie
I stick to the script, you be thumbin' right through
It
I do it, I do it, I do it
She givin' it to me, I'm ‘bout to lose it
Pussy so wet I'mma need a canoe or a cruise ship
She said "Is it good?" and I said "absolutely"
Now light up that doobie like Shaggy and Scooby
I ain't even know they made a remix to it
Baby, let me see you do it
Stacks so big can't see nothing through it
Money gonna flow like fluid
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain't nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what's up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
Word on the streets I'mma kill this
Hangin' with the niggas on a remix
Top down with the weed lit
Ain't nobody fucking with me, bitch
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain't nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what's up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
Kid Ink, I'm sitting in the back of the ‘Lac
Pull up to the club in a back front pack
Going straight to the back section, low slack my
Track goin'
Boom boom, club filled with a whole lot of poom
Poom
Better cuff your chick cause she is doomed
In this bitch with the platoon now
These shots going round
Rotating with the ass, same time
Can't help but stare
I feel like a dog, canine
Nah, nah, ain't mine
Table rocking like a seance
Booty's going up, down
But you know i stay high, high
Word on the street I'mma kill this, I'm the illest
Girl, come suck me now
Finger in her booty hole, watch how that thing go
Up and down
Ain't even know if it was real, but it clapped the
K.O.D way
Just got out, I stay on hard, girl, I could do this all
Day
Earthquake, earthquake, earthquake earthquake
Shake it like you thirsty
So I remixed on her homegirl and wished ‘em
Happy birthday
Money real long and the weed lit (smell it)
All I really want is a freak chick
So jump in these drop top, make it pop lock
Cause G shit on the remix, boom
Still doing what I do best
Shots fired when I spit hot fire
Got a pussy nigga running with new vests
I'm not lying, you can go stop trying
Hate it when I love it, love it when I ball
Tell your girl to come and she gon' love the way I
Ball
Put a hundred on a lady, she'd be giving me a call
Cause she done told my lady she don't f**k with
You at all
Naw, I throw a stack in the air
I don't give a fuck, nigga, I'mma make it right back
I get it crackin' in here
Give me a fifth of [?], nigga, don't know me like
That
I'm way too dirty and I'm way too raw
So baby you gonna take it up down - or nah?
