[Intro: Verse Simmonds]
Sexy, sexy body, sexy, sexy body

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I need that body cold as a freeze pad
Front to the back, I'm just giving you my feedback
Every time I look your way I see you cheesin'
Young Pocahontas know a nigga cheefin
Lalalala, that punanana, on my mind a lot, the timing now
Dancing on my lap, like a MacBook drop, all night the shots ain't never gonna stop
I came to turn the party out, old school game like I brought the Atari out, you ain't gotta say much
See your body calling out, don't get lost in the crowd make sure you pay attention when we walking out

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
He acts like he don't want you
When he should be getting that every night
Putting you to sleep like a lullaby
Baby there's something about you
And if he don't want it I get it I get it
You know they say one mans trash is another mans gift
She got it all together got her own thing going
She ain't got a lotta friends she ain't got no time for it
And she dress to the team when she in that Tom Ford
And you best to believe she gon' gimme that oh oh
He been playing with it, girl you badder than all these hoes I don't get it. Let me get all of the things you ain't getting
Sexy body your body party I wanna feel it

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
(na na) She just wanna be sexy for somebody, and that somebody could be me tonight. (na na na) she just wanna be sexy for somebody, and that somebody could be me yeah
Sexy (gimme that), sexy body, sexy (gimme that), sexy body

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
It ain't too much I won't do
And I can already tell that you afraid
Can't explain how bad I want you oh na
And I know that you ain't had a real nigga like me
Put it on you, after you take it off
Imma turn your body on just to break you off
Tryna make you moan while I play this song
Got to turnin off your phone cause you know I'm tryna
Give it to you like it's your birthday, got me thinkin bout it all night in the worst way, say you wanna ride all night you can surf babe, that's perfect, we can make it work baby

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
(na na) She just wanna be sexy for somebody, and that somebody could be me tonight. (na na na) she just wanna be sexy for somebody, and that somebody could be me yeah
