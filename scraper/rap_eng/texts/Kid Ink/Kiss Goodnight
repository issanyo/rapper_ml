[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Before I let you go, can I get a kiss?
Can I feel them lips? I'm talkin' 'bout the ones between yo hips
Wussup? Wussup? I just wanna know right now, now
Before I take out out, girl
I wanna know if I should be spendin' all of these dollar bills on you
I wanna know that after we leave the club that you gon' be tryna come through
Wussup? Wussup? I just wanna know right now, now
Baby, before I go, can I get a kiss goodnight?

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Just let a nigga know what's good
Let a nigga know what's up, let a nigga know what's real
You can keep it 100, hunnid, hunnid
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
Just let a nigga know it's good
Let a nigga know wussup, let a nigga know it's real
You can keep it 100, hunnid, hunnid
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
Yeah, before I let you go, before you've been dismissed
Can I put my name on it so you won't forget?
Wussup? Wussup? Let me see you turn around, round
Baby, before I go, can I get a kiss goodnight?

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Just let a nigga know what's good
Let a nigga know what's up, let a nigga know what's real
You can keep it 100, hunnid, hunnid
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
Let a nigga know it's good
Let a nigga know wussup, let a nigga know what's real
You can keep it 100, hunnid, hunnid
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I said keep it 100
I been outchea gettin' money
And we don't really stop for nothin'
But it's somethin' 'bout you
Got a young nigga seein' red
No bullshit, tell me what it's gon' do
Is you down for the put?
Party, after the club, don't act brand new
All them drinks she was pourin'
Pourin' the Patron with lime, no juice, get loose
'Fore I let you go
I just gotta let you know
You in a league, of your own
Star player
In the 4th, gon' pucker up
And kiss that bottle
You don't need no cup, you don't need no luck
Fuck 7, you a 10, let me know what's up
The sky is the limit, wait a minute

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Before I let you go away
Can I get a kiss goodnight, baby?

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Just let a nigga what's good
Let a nigga know what's up, let a nigga know what's real
You can keep it 100, hunnid, hunnid
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
Just let a nigga know it's good
Let a nigga know wussup, let a nigga know it's real
You can keep it 100, hunnid, hunnid
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
