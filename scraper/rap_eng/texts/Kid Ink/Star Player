I swear if bad girls had a team
You'd be the mascot and the star player
You got skills baby that I never seen
You tryna ball, you could be my star player (yeah)
Star, you can be a star
Said everything can change, you could be my star player
Star, you can be a star
I can put you in the game, come and be my star player

[Verse 1]
I said if bad girls had a team
You'd be the MVP of the league, yeah
And everything ain't always what it seem
In the dark, it ain't hard, I can tell you a freak, said
Just come with me and you can be a star
Go on, keep it rollin, I'll tell you when the scene is off
Fly motherfucker, wings like you got Adidas on
Sippin this Patr√≥n, bet I get you in the bed or something
That's what you better know, tell me yes, never no
And let me be the coach and I'mma get you rings like Michael Jordan

When you hit the floor you be the only one that's scoring
