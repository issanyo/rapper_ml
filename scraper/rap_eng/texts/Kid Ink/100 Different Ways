[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's 100 different ways get a young nigga high
Been doin' all of 'em the same time
Seen 'em go broke and I seen some die
But it ain't been enough to change my mind
I'm gone
Lost in the crowd
Blunts and bottles keep tossin' around
Feel like both feet off of the groud
It's 100 different ways we could take your chick
How many shots can you take from the fifth
It's now or never baby, take your pick
Rocketshipshawty, I take off quick like woo
Blowin' that smoke in the air
We load it, open, we share
With me, ain't nobody sober in here
It's 100 different ways
It's 100 different ways
It's 100 different ways

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I got my ways
I got my ways
365, there's not enough days
For me to get paid but nigga, I'm tryin'
I can't sit back and recline
I can't go back into time
No Marty McFly, I can't go back to the slum
Village of villains and niggas sellin' them dimes
That shit could fuck up your mind
Or it could turn men into mice
You know the line, money ain't everythin'
But it made all my problems disappear like a fuckin' mirage
Treatin' champagne by the boat
Burnin' and makin' one hell of a toast
I got my ways, hop on the wave
Teach you to swim baby, show you the stroke
Since I lost my virginity, I been like
Fuck you, pay me, everyday pay day
Bet you the girl that I lost it to
Tell bitches she hit it first, just like she Ray J
I swear that she work at the club
Now I threw her a 100
One hand in the air, not the Nae Nae
Not play date if she wanna kick it like Pele

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's 100 different ways
It's 100 different ways
It's 100 different ways

[Verse 2: HardHead]
And I'm on number 9
Prolly' on a few drugs all at the same time
Couple hoes walkin' in, pussy poppin' for a nigga
Couple niggas poppin' shots, no bottle for the liquor
I'm gone, lost in the mansion
4 in the mornin', got some texts, still advancin'
Pull up to her spot with a bag, no trash bands
Mr I-don't-give-a-fuck, you ain't gotta ask me shit
Shit, been with the shit
Gettin' all this money, I'mma spend all this shit
All these Hollywood hoes, bitch been on my dick
Goin' 0-100, hope the car don't flip
I'm gone, all around the globe
Collectin' passport stamps like Pokemon Go
More more broke nights, heating up the house up by the stove
Walk in any store now, buy anythin' I want
Most of these rappers be lyin' to win
While me and my niggas been winnin'
Beginnin' to gettin' to actin' to
Closin' conditions, it's different
You act like you don't but your bitch know the difference
No clothes in the gap so allow me to ditch them myself
And I help you for instance you bitches
Are interest for bein' a hashtag
And the Lord is my witness

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It's 100 different ways
It's 100 different ways
It's 100 different ways

[Verse 3: Vee Tha Rula]
And I know where to get it
I haven't been lost in a minute
These ghetto boys never had nothin'
So we gon' hotbox in that Benley
We used to fly through the houses
Run out then hop over the fences
That's what you get, you shouldn't had a nice house, nigga
Dirty boots like fuck your couch, nigga
Pass that, don't call time out
At the top tryna help my niggas climb out
Baby boy, you with us we at your mom's house
Don't lose your mind, hope that you niggas find out
Pound for pound, my bars on lock down
When I see the weed, get happy, start yellin' like James Brown
Drive slow like I'm from H-Town
If you wanna get up, then stay down
What the fuck's the difference
Hustlin', pimpin', murder mittin'
Bust the pistols, fuck you, stack my ducks to 100 digits
'Fore I kick the bucket, need a bucket to piss in
We ain't had shit but spaghetti
Everythin' could go with baby ready
She said that I'm a god, Macavelli
Got scars on my bars, oh Lord, I'm a legend
Buffalo sauce on my lips
You prolly' never heard it, just forget it
I'm lookin' good on every single edit
Kill the pussy, I'm the player and the paramedic
Ball hard while I'm gettin' paid
Think smart, get your dollar saved
And do a lil bit of everythin'
Shit
