[Intro: Kid Ink]
Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay
This right here
For the ones who ain't listen
When I told em' we would kill it
Luckily it ain't a witness
So I probably have a sentence
Society menace
Just give me a minute
They gon know just how I'm feelin'
When it bang bang
Right over your head
I'm on a higher level
Tryna find somewhere to land
Catch me if you can
I'm always with the camp
Try and see me through the tent
Wait, who the fuck you with
Now ain't no need for the hatin' over here
If you was gettin' money too
Then you would have a chandelier
On your neck
Less you know who the next is
Bout to make a movie and I got another clip
If you wanna let it

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Bang
You ain't never turned up like this
Let it bang bang
Let it ring, let it ring
And let it bang
I see you lookin' in my eyes
Like you really wanna bang bang
Let it ring, let it ring
And let it bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Let it ring, let it ring
And let it bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Uh, all I need is the team and my bitch
You know its RIP to all the competition
Red rum, red eyes, blow smoke and disappear
Way I'm feelin' myself
You would think there was nobody here
Say life is a bitch
I just pull her by the hair
Beast mode but your girlfriend call me papa bear
Gettin' high off a blunt full of that Donatello
I run my city, leave all you niggas trailin'
Way back before the Range and the fame
I was good in the hood and today it ain't changed
I ain't ever lost a chain
Tell em' all I do is win
Take a shot, don't even try to pretend
Go ahead and let it

[Hook: Kid Ink]
