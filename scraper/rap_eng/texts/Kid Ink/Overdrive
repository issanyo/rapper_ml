Father please forgive me
I'm out in sin city with the presi suite
We prayin' that your girlfriend don't ever meet
Baby boy in that new toy with them leather seats
Think she hear to peak, but I ain't got no limit
I'm off the hinges and takin' shots like it's my first time off the benches
But you know it's and one, how I handle all my business
These bullets they ain't got no name and neither do these bitches
Duckin' all the pictures, never leave no witnesses
You don't really live like us, lil nigga the jig is up
Baby, grab my hand, Disneyland, slip a mickey
I ain't pop no pill but I threw it in the Henny and

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
They say life is what you make it
My whole life changed when I made a mil
Moved out the hood to in between the hills
You know all the plays and you seen the drills
We don't feel sorry for you niggas, not even a little
Ridin through the vill when them wheels is steel
Like Shaquille, keep it real
Later, ain't no tellin' how I'm 'bout to feel
Cause that shit be hittin' different when you get a silk buzz
Kriss Kross, mix the liquor, shit is still jumpin'
Way that we been gettin' it
Can't nobody mimic
I just need another minute
See we goin' really stupid
Tell my dog he shouldn't of let me off the leash

[Hook: P Wright]

But we go overdrive
Just copped the new shawty
That bitch in overdrive

But we go overdrive
Just copped the new shawty
That bitch in overdrive
