[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Just let me roll somethin' up and get high with me baby
Ayy, you're a star, you're so fly to me baby
And to keep it real, your body drivin' me crazy
Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby
She could tell it by the look in my eyes
All a nigga ever do is get high
Countin' money with my niggas, stay fly
Run the game, my niggas bang, that's no lie
Just let me roll somethin' up and get high with me baby
Ayy, you're a star, you're so fly to me baby
And to keep it real, your body drivin' me crazy
Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
And you know how the set roll
Landin' where the jet go
She can't ever let go
Cause I give her bank rolls
Cross him, break his ankles
What the fuck he think?
I pull up like what it ain't though
Tell me what it is
Niggas talkin' 'bout where I can't go
Tell me where it is
Got the drop on where he stay though
I know where he lives
Niggas thinkin' I'm a game though
So quick to let it rip
Talkin' way before the fame
Need a gun, I'm on they head
Niggas actin' like some babies
Swear them boys my kids
'Member days was in the trap house
Runnin' through them bricks
Never have to see 'em drizzy
Was taught to water whip
Never have to see 'em drizzy
Was taught to water whip

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Just let me roll somethin' up and get high with me baby
Ayy, you're a star, you're so fly to me baby
And to keep it real, your body drivin' me crazy
Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby
She could tell it by the look in my eyes
All a nigga ever do is get high
Countin' money with my niggas, stay fly
Run the game, my niggas bang, that's no lie
Just let me roll somethin' up and get high with me baby
Ayy, you're a star, you're so fly to me baby
And to keep it real, your body drivin' me crazy
Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I know you can see the look in my eye
I been gettin' high but somebody took my light
I been on some other shit
Tell them come and wipe me down
'Member all them old bitches hatin'
Bet they like me now, right
Just walked in like I hopped up out the arena
Fist full of money like power to the people
Shot gun, shawty, feel the power of that reefer
Girl I'm hosting for the night
It's an hour 'til we leaving, said
Keep it rollin' up, pourin' up
You say you need a shot, baby girl load it up
I swear the way we goin' up, they know this us
I know that all you lookin' for, baby, is for the love
