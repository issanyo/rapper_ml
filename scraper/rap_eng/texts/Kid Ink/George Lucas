[Hook: Kid Ink]
I got no excuses, I'm 'bout to fuckin' lose this
Oh this game exclusive, we ain't never losin'
All my fuckin' crew here, don't try actin' clueless
All we make is movies, George fuckin' Lucas
All we make is movies
All we make is
In the club I'm George fuckin' Lucas
I'm 'bout to fuckin' lose this

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay, I walk inside this bitch like tonight I'm tryna earn
To the knotches on my belt, feel like I can't hold my pants
I could prolly' take your chick if I really took the chance
When they play her favorite song, she know all the fuckin' dances, oh yeah
Aw man, don't stop, baby girl, go 'head
And I know when I'm watchin'
And I love when you drop it down
Down baby with your bow legs
You keep doin' what you're doin' and I'm throwin' what I'm throwin'
I could pay monthly, your whole rent
I got that money on my mind but I lost it
At the same time, don't make no sense
It's a star wars if you with it
Drive my spaceship back to the future
OG Skyywalker in the blunt
I'ma prolly' go back to my planet when it's finished

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I got no excuses, I'm 'bout to fuckin' lose this
Oh this game exclusive, we ain't never losin'
All my fuckin' crew here, don't try actin' clueless
All we make is movies, George fuckin' Lucas
All we make is movies
All we make is
In the club I'm George fuckin' Lucas

[Verse 2: King Los]
All these niggas just the same nigga
All these groupies is the same to me
I don't know who the fuck to blame here
But all this goofy shit is lame to me
Threw the whole dash with the gold pass
In my own class, baby slow class
Come on take a pie with a cool guy
I know all about the wave like a pool guy
I just copped a presidental out in Dubai
And I roll 100 swishas, I got too high
Out of my mind, I need to be minded
To tell these niggas catch up
There's no condoms, bench on the side of it
Go ahead and get the wallet
And I fuck around in got so deep up in it
Left my wallet in it
Wish we got it bigger
Cause we started from the bottom
Would have hoped you takin' notes
Just so you pussy niggas know how to kick it

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I got no excuses, I'm 'bout to fuckin' lose this
Oh this game exclusive, we ain't never losin'
All my fuckin' crew here, don't try actin' clueless
All we make is movies, George fuckin' Lucas
All we make is movies
All we make is
In the club I'm George fuckin' Lucas
I'm 'bout to fuckin' lose this
