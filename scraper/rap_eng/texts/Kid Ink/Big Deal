[Intro]
Big deal, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Bankroll got It

[Chorus]
Big deals, big wheels
Come with me, you looking for a quick thrill
Fishtail hangin' out the windshield
Click trill, tell yo bitch chill
Big deals, big wheels
Come with me, you looking for a quick thrill

[Verse 1]
I been lowkey like a locksmith
But I know you love it when I pop shit
Fishtail the Chevy out the lot quick
Watch just how I turn into a rocket
Been ill way before the big deal
Back when we was livin' on filet and fish meals
Young nigga came up, hit the windmill
See you playin' out your heart, I'ma win still
Fillin' up my blunt with picante
Knock a nigga out like Deontay (uh)
House sauce drippin' on the kenzo
30 bands comin' through my Venmo

[Chorus]
Big deals, big wheels
Come with me, you looking for a quick thrill
Fishtail hangin' out the windshield
Click trill, tell yo bitch chill
Big deals, big wheels
Come with me, you looking for a quick thrill

[Verse 2]
Fightin with the blunt, that shit hittin' still
Shawty on a pill, she ain't sittin' still
Say you do it big, that shit miniscule
Money's all I talk, check the dentist bill
Tell them they can leave me alone
So fake, nigga, you can't even be you at home
Had a good year, but we didn't see you for long
Little lightskin nigga came to even the tone (okay)
I been tryna keep it down, whole lotta loud
Rockin' that new season, now you outta style
Ball hard, might just put you outta bounds
Talk behind my back, but never backtalk when I'm around

[Chorus]
Big deals, big wheels
Come with me, you looking for a quick thrill
Fishtail hangin' out the windshield
Click trill, tell yo bitch chill
Big deals, big wheels
Come with me, you looking for a quick thrill
