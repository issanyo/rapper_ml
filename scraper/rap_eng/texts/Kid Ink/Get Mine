[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, first off, eat a dick, try to tell me I ain't work hard
Where I'm from yeah, I could be worse off, life is a bitch, it was her loss
But I made it through the pain like a tattoo, turned me to a young nigga with an attitude
What it do? Ain't shit changed, west side, you know the fucking name
It’s Kid Ink baby, came real far, back then yeah they used to call me rock star
I'm still a rock star, 2 fingers up, like one just ain't enough, ah
Uh fuck the world now we making love, been doing this shit you niggas making up
Fast life full shift, never breaking up, I got bars nigga, never breaking up, you hear me?

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Yeah we came a long way from nothing
Made it through it all so it must be something
Better get ready, tell them we coming
Never back down, even when they all fronting
I gotta get mine
Get it go, get it go, get it go go
I gotta get mine
Get it go, get it go, get it go go

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah, cause they ain't gon' give it to me, take shots but they ain't sending to me
Want something done right better do it nigga, on the wild ride with a bunch of fluids in us
Been letting nigga slide like a playground, anyone wanna tell them there’s enough to go around
Yeah, it’s going down, beef ain't nothing but a quarter pound, ah
And I'm ill, cancer, gon' bust a move like a soul train dancer
Yeah I'm on they heads, antlers, can you feel the fire, campers?
You already know who I roll with, Alumni, Bat Gang, better get focus
Uh they all looking hopeless, just tell them you can hold this

[Chorus]
Yeah we came a long way from nothing
Made it through it all so it must be something
Better get ready, tell them we coming
Never back down, even when they all fronting
I gotta get mine
Get it go, get it go, get it go go
I gotta get mine
Get it go, get it go, get it go go

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Believe that, I'mma need that, please no opinions if I ain't ask for your feedback
Look, nigga, we that Stevie Wonder can see that, all of these shows sell out, and all of my hoes to see that
Wait, niggas relax, I'm in the son, B-act but take it before they miss us, we back real
Nigga respect anywhere that we be at still, niggas special when reach the level we at kill
Jealous niggas  catch the case but we gonna beat that still, cash rules everything that nigga we got bills
My seat back, Dickie pockets with G' stacks, play with me wrong, I promise you get lead too fast
Yeah I sing that, said that we achieved that, built the shit out from nothing now
Baling my reflex nigga, where you came at? Baby yeah where'd you be at?
We killing competition, no condolence, get the Kleenex on
Pissing on pots at the repass
Full time grind no recess
Expensive ass pussy if I need that
Baby suck it so good, I'm like "Damn, where your teeth at?"

[Chorus]
Yeah we came a long way from nothing
Made it through it all so it must be something
Better get ready, tell them we coming
Never back down, even when they all fronting
I gotta get mine
Get it go, get it go, get it go go
I gotta get mine
Get it go, get it go, get it go go
