[Intro: Kid Ink]
Let's go, woo
I've been tryna get over you
Hitmaka
Baby, uh huh
Dolla $ign, yeah, yeah
Baby, you already know what I'm tryna do
Oh yeah
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hot box, drop top the 'rari
Hop out, night life, Iâ€™m sorry (Skrrt)
Red Bull, mix that Bacardi
You know we likes to party
Na, na, na, na, wheels up on the jet
La, la, la, la roll up after sex
I'm just here to find you round the way
I'm just here to find, oh yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Kid Ink]
I really like, what you, done to me (like)
I can't, really explain it, I still fuck with you
I really like, what you, done to me (like)
I can't, really explain it, I still fuck with you

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Oh yeah, down to the core, yeah
Couldn't tell you better than I show ya
Been tryin' so hard to ignore the
Way you make that clap, Nola, Nola
See you curve in a stack in your frame, girl
Dip swerve, then I'm back in your lane, girl
Keep that ass up all night, restless
I just finger roll and finesse it
Straight up, no time for the extras
Know you been through it but fuck all your exes, aw yeah
The way you been lookin' so sexy
I might just let you take some pics in my necklace, aw yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Kid Ink]
I really like, what you, done to me (like) (what you)
I can't, really explain it, I still fuck with you (I can't, no, no, no)
I really like, what you, done to me (like) (what you)
I can't, really explain it, I still fuck with you

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, yeah (You Ooh)
Yeah, yeah (You Ooh)
Yeah, yeah (You Ooh)
I still fuck with you (with you)

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Please believe me (believe me)
I ain't talkin' Vegas
When I say I'll take you to the Venetian
Gettin' high, red eye on the PJ
Touch down, top floor in the PH
I know you hear us loud on the PA
What I'm on, give her game like EA
Ease up, baby, give me a little leeway
But make sure you keep it in motion
Wake up and know we get straight to memosas, aw yeah
Be on the first thing smokin'
Or you, if you down, drop the roof, see me coastin', aw yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Kid Ink]
I really like, what you, done to me (like) (what you)
I can't, really explain it, I still fuck with you (I can't, no, no, no)
I really like, what you, done to me (like) (what you)
I can't, really explain it, I still fuck with you

[Post-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, yeah (You Ooh)
Yeah, yeah (You Ooh)
Yeah, yeah (You Ooh)
I still fuck with you (with you)
