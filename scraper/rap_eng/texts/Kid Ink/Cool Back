[Intro]
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm just tryna bring cool back
Can't too many motherfuckers pull that off
Looking like a million dollar outfit
Nah, nigga, that's me, it don't matter what it cost
Make it look good
Had it on 'fore you seen it in a look book
Said, you ain't fucking with a young fresh ass nigga
Fashion police should arrest that nigga
Okay, okay, kay, kay, okay
I'm with a model ass bitch out in St. Tropez
In some high ass heels, can't stand all day
It's a price for your beauty, baby girl, I pay

[Chorus]
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga, I'm just tryna bring cool back, I'm just tryna bring cool back

[Verse 2]
I walk in like Joker
Living like Bruce Wayne, can I get a toast to
All of the light skin girls and the mochas?
Tryna get it in for the night, no emotion, motion
My way
Everything I own off the runway
Talking 'bout the girls and even the white tape
Yippee ki-yay, hippie eyes, sit behind, need a frames
I'm way too fresh go and let a nigga cook
Money on the cover, nigga, I'm that book
Know you went to the store, they ain't had this
All you motherfuckers look like last year, and

[Chorus]
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga, I'm just tryna bring cool back

[Verse 3]
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Wax in a blunt, wax in a denim
Rodeo for the linen
I'm a cool nigga out in Beverly Hills like Dilla
Okay, okay
Waving this dede all up in your face
See the O.J. glove, red carpet killer
Rest of you niggas just seat fillers
Say ain't nobody cooler
All you dirty motherfuckers look like Kunta
Walk right by get a wet in the chooch
Steal yo bitch, nigga, like King Koopa, when

[Chorus x2]
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga, I'm just tryna bring cool back
Fashion police should arrest that nigga
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga
I walk in this bitch, like a motherfucking villain
Fashion police should arrest that nigga
I'm just tryna bring cool back
