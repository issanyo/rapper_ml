[Instrumental break]
[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Intro]
Pair of J's kicking down your doorway
You know what it is, I gotta get mine
You know what it is, only real recognize
Wake up in the morning and the first thing
Going through my head is money on my mind
I don't do good on the first date (nope)
Because I'll be thinking dollars with your ass by my side
Riding like I'm tryna get first place
Pull up, Corvette, to a court date
Kissin' on the blunt like foreplay
You know what it is (4K)

[Verse 1]
I need every single chain one-four-K
Neck so cold, in the summer need a north face
Ice baby, sorbet
I went from eating government to gourmet
I could never go back to the old days
But I swear this new money got me in my old ways
I've been killing all this niggas (hold up)
Doing forensics

[Hook]
Pair of J's kicking down your doorway
You know what it is, I gotta get mine
I don't make bets, need a sure play
You know what it is, only real recognize
You know what it is, only real recognize
You know what it is, only real recognize

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting back chilling with my old friends
Some of them are with me since kickstands
Most of them disappeared like quicksand
He don't know the kind they don't reach them
I'm talking dead presidents, nigga, sixth sense
Swear more money, more problems, how this shit been
I ain't tryna complain nigga, just vent
These niggas thinking they shinin', but it's just them (woah)
Let me grab my shades and adjust them
Stylist, watch and a nigga tryna dress them
I'm just being blunt, roll one to my young face
Niggas think I'm passing, audible, run play
Puff puff, pump fake, shawty wanna ball break
Let her get one take, just left a lunch date
Eatin' over here, why you tryna get your cum straight
I'm coming to the plate, running for the saint

[Hook]
Pair of J's kicking down your doorway
You know what it is, I gotta get mine
I don't make bets, need a sure play
You know what it is, only real recognize
You know what it is, only real recognize
You know what it is, only real recognize

[Verse 3]
Real, recognize real
I got a couple pills for the night
I just took flight, flight attendant telling me to put away my device
Remember in the days when I felt so deprived, now I'm cuttin' up a check and dividin' the pie with the team
Everything ain't always what it seems, check the seam of these 31/32 jeans

[Outro]
You know what it is, only
Recognize
Recognize
