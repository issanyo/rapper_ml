[Intro]
Rider...
Uh...yea yea
(said im a mothafuckin rider)

[Verse 1]
They tryin to tell me slow up keep it snail
Settle down, be yourself
Stop trying to act like whats his name?
But i dont know how to be no one else
Made in the mothafuckin' city
Ain't no blueprint tryin to make a milli
"stay in school" is all they yelling
No degree? nigga must be a failure
Thats that dream that a broke nigga sell ya
But i dont pay no attention
See the goal that im going for inches with no worries and no em'phsis
My, name is all that i carry
The pain is all that I bury
Stay, gassed up the lights out we riding around no right route just..

[Hook]
Lookin' at the side of the road
I been ready to roll
Tryin' to ride in my own lane
Can't nobody tell me to stop
No not even the cops
I don't think that its gone change
Ima mothafuckin' rider
Better get beside cause
Tryina' ride in my own lane
Said I'm a mothafuckin' rider
Better get beside cause...
Tryin' to ride in my own lane..

[Verse 2]
Uh
So
What, the fuck, is you sayin?
We dont sound no where close to the same
Just listen close to the shit you playing
Ain't nothing new in my city
Tattoos from the bottom all the way to the brain
Errybody here need a PCA
We living that real life G-T-A
Check yo map thats what I stay
Nigga dont need no PS-tres
Reporting from the westside
My niggas gone eat like anime
And i may, show out
That's the only way a young nigga know how
To appreciate my blessings
Maybe sooner or learn my lesson, but...
Im a motherfucking rider
Car full a bitches how they even fit inside here?
Been the same way since high school its nothing awkward
You can't tell me nothing too high tryin to listen but its obvious

[Hook]

Uh
Kid Ink (UGH)
Alumni Bitch
Yeah
I know you see me pullin up
My own lane
