[Intro: Kid Ink]
Out, said I'ma need you to get the fuck up…
Or, so don’t sit around

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Ay, what you came for?
Know I came with my niggas and the bank roll
Sorry I ain’t try'na sound like an A-hole
But I don’t need you acting like a state ho ay ho
Straight up try'na figure out your angle
It could be the heels fucking up your ankles
Now ain’t nobody mad at you but
Just wanna see that ass on you go
Up, bust it back and forth
With your attitude don’t take it personal
Cash up face down with your purse on the floor
V.I.P. player I’m the person to know

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I said why you even, out, with an attitude
You know I’m try'na, wild, so don’t sit around
Don’t sit around, or I'ma need you to get out
So don’t sit around, or I'ma need you to get the fuck out

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
And quit it with the bullshit
Always try'na play it cool whip
When, a nigga wetter than a pool dip
Almost done with the 4/5
You was good at first and then you full flip
I'ma need you to get out
Club going up I don’t need you to sit down
Try'n get high go on pass that shit round
Be, careful when you hit it
And you should drink lesser of that Henney
Let me get champagne for the champions
You ain’t gotta worry about a damn thing
When, you fucking with a nigga
Heavy now she fucking with a nigga
Check my wrist it’s a Rollie on mine
And you could be doing something better with your time

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I said why you even, out, with an attitude
You know I’m try'na, wild, so don’t sit around
Don’t sit around, or I'ma need you to get out
So don’t sit around, or I'ma need you to get the fuck out
