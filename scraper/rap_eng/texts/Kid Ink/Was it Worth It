[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah, you been out on your own
Now tell me was it worth it?
I think it's time to come home, you've been out on your own
Now tell me was it worth it?

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Just, looking back on what we had
It’s clear to see U Got it Bad, it’s just like Usher said
Let it burn, and watch just how the tables turned
Don't know what you've got until it's gone is what you're gon' to learn today
Truth is, ain't no need to lie, girl
You the baddest on the planet but I could show you a better world
Free as you want and I don't ever get too jealous
I know we got a connection that is tighter than your leggings, girl
Why you acting dumb when I know just where your head is?
Super freaky in the bedroom, bet you they ain't seen the half of it
Gon' and bring it back to me
Just make sure that you really ready 'fore you start unpacking shit

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Now tell me, was it worth it?
Stop messing round with them lames, on the same bullshit, ain't gon' change
Now tell me, was it worth it?
Uh I gave you a little space and time, but ain't no more we should waste
You know I can show you better, show you better, show you better than that
I know you better, know you better, know you better than that
I can show you better, show you better, show you better than that
I know you better, know you better, know you better than that
Now tell me, was it worth it?

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah, a whole lot of women in the club look in my direction
But you the one that I want, know you want the same thing
Why you tryna front in front of your friends' old hating ass?
They like "Why you take him back?" I just need another chance
Show you what you missing on, know the feeling isn't gone
Let me get you high again, baby girl, it's hitting strong
I've been on some other shit, but I know that you've been alone
Gon' and bring that ass home

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Now tell me, was it worth it?
Stop messing round with them lames, on the same bullshit, ain't gon' change
Now tell me, was it worth it?
Uh I gave you a little space and time, but ain't no more we should waste
You know I can show you better, show you better, show you better than that
I know you better, know you better, know you better than that
I can show you better, show you better, show you better than that
I know you better, know you better, know you better than that

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Uh yeah, I know you better than that
I'll show you better than that
And don't nobody in the world get it wetter than that
I got money on my mind but my head in your lap
Girl, your leg to your back, whole word hear you screaming'
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Baby, baby, I think it's time to come home
You've been out on your own

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Now tell me, was it worth it?
Stop messing round with them lames, on the same bullshit, ain't gon' change
Now tell me, was it worth it?
Uh I gave you a little space and time, but ain't no more we should waste
You know I can show you better, show you better, show you better than that
I know you better, know you better, know you better than that
I can show you better, show you better, show you better than that
I know you better, know you better, know you better than that
