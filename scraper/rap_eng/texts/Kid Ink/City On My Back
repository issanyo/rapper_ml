[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Hook]
I be running through the city (yup), city on my back (back)
It ain’t nothing changed, but the money on my lap (lap)
True I’m in the game (game), time til it’s over (till it's over)
Til it’s over (till it's over), til it’s over
I be running through the city (yup), city on my back (back)
It ain’t nothing changed, but the money on my lap (lap)
True I’m in the game, til it’s over (till it's over)
Til it’s over (till it's over), til it’s over

[Verse 1]
I be running through the city, city on my back (back)
Way before the fame and all this love and all these stacks
I was just a lil' homie, now you see me bossin' up
Never seen me in a suit, sue me I don’t give a fuck
Got the whole team here, no coach needed
Ball hard, coast season home court playing, why you sideline hating
When I’m just tryna go get mine, it’s gang time, time I shine
My eyesight straight these lines to the go, ready for the show
Ready for the hoes, who ready to roll
Gone with the wind, you been ready to blow
Blow my high, don’t kill the vibe
3rd degree still burning slow
You could never put my lights out, money out this world, got more to count
Probably get more than I can account for

[Hook]

True I’m in the game, til it’s over (till it's over)
Til it’s over (till it's over), til it’s over
