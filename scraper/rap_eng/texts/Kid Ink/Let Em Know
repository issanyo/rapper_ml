[Hook: Kid Ink x2]
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
This somethin' you don't know about

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout
Roll up, know I'ma bring the fog out
Everybody wanna hate when you ball out
Real recognize real, we don't fall out, hol' up
Know what I'm talkin' bout, no I ain't with the bullshit
When I see you work that, on a full shift
Heard you lookin' for a shot, got a full clip, hol' up
Kush the aroma, talkin' bout you got a pack, go on roll up
Been sippin' from the bottle like soda
With a bad bitch whom runnin' like Sosa, hol' up

[Hook: Kid Ink x2]
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
This somethin' you don't know about

[Verse 2: Vee Tha Rula]
Long live the life so a nigga gon' kill it (Bang!)
We don't know what you talkin' bout WIllis
And the drugs got us numb but somehow we both feel it
Get my brains blew off, yeah nigga no ceilings, ooh!
And we ball nigga, count it, count it
These other rappers soft like Downy, Downy
Bitches try to catch me like a bounty
Young D-boy, I just got up out the county
Ain't no way around it
They feelin' the boy, look at the boy
And I see food differently, my dinner is coy
Lil' mami sex pistol and she killin' the boy
Then I make her ass work it out
Know what I'm talkin' bout

[Hook: Kid Ink x2]
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
Let em know what I'm talkin' bout, hol' up
This somethin' you don't know about
