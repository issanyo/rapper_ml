[Hook]
I said don't you act like that
Just let your freak out
I think we should leave now
Don't you act like that
Tried something new
The things I'm a do to you
You too
Things I'm a do to you
You too
Things I'm a do to you, you
Had you running to your friends
Like, damn he the man
Might just let you get a chance girl

[Verse 1]
Uh, I see you looking at your girlfriend
Yeah, I'm sayin' like she your girlfriend
Damn, you probably think I don't know
Keep it real, my mind is on the same thang
See you ain't gotta change the way you feel
Girl you still shine like stainless steel
In my eyes but tonight let's make a deal
Gon' tell the waiter to get the bill now
Some say, 3's a crowd but
I say, it's looking like a party now
Some say 2 heads are better than one
Sounds good to me, would you agree
I ain't tryin' to pressure you at all
But remember the night
When we first had to talk and
You said if you was drunk and
She was bad as fuck then
We could probably try something
'Till you had enough now

[Hook]
I said don't you act like that
Just let your freak out
I think we should leave now
Don't you act like that
Tried something new
The things I'm a do to you
You too
Things I'm a do to you
You too
Things I'm a do to you, you
Had you running to your friends
Like, damn he the man
Might just let you get a chance girl

[Verse 2]
Some say what they wanna say
Just let me know if you want to wait
But I can tell, it's written all on your face
And it's no better to time or place
Than now, tell me how does that sound
California king lay you both down
Huh, It's getting hot in here
Think I might just sit back and watch in here
Now don't you act like that
You know you the one girl
And it's only fun
You can't make it a personal vendetta
At the end of the day
You know you gonna get it better
So why sit and worry about tomorrow
After tonight steady lookin' at my phone
Seein' if she called girl
That ain't what I'm on
And you should already know

[Hook]
I said don't you act like that
Just let your freak out
I think we should leave now
Don't you act like that
Tried something new
The things I'm a do to you
You too
Things I'm a do to you
You too
Things I'm a do to you, you
Had you running to your friends
Like, damn he the man
Might just let you get a chance girl
