[Intro]
Yeah, I wish I never had to leave
I wish this club never closed
And I know one thing that I'mma always do me
And never be what you want
And I know one thing, if I get one more drink
Then I'mma fly to the sky
And you won't see me, no more
Cause I'm so high and I don't wanna be nowhere else

[Hook]
Slow down, I ain't in a hurry, I'm having too much fun
Yeah baby, I love life, I love life
Day by day, you see me getting paid, never gon' stop, never gon' change
Yeah baby, I love life, I love my life

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, and I can't complain, did a lot of things I can't explain
But I know we had a good time, wish I go back, press rewind
But I gotta live for the moment, come home real late like Conan
And there ain't no telling when the show end, nigga probably won't leave 'til closing
Cause I'm cool like Free-On, chilling in my negative free zone
Somewhere in the cut, lesion, taking more shots than LeBron
Can't be last to the front, keep my chin up like Natalie Nunn
Ladies, I'm just trying to have a little fun and see which is the nastiest one

[Hook]
Slow down, I ain't in a hurry, I'm having too much fun
Yeah baby, I love life, I love life
Day by day, you see me getting paid, never gon' stop, never gon' change
Yeah baby, I love life, I love my life

[Verse 2]
I daydream, looking off, in space, tooking off
Sometimes life is a cookie jar, but I wouldn't trade it like a rookie card
Ha, I go rookie hard, stay wavy like a boogie board
Rolling with the surf club, one more drink and it's curtains
I said ain't nothing certain
But death, wish I could reverse her
One day it'll all seem worth it
Until then, you can live through my verses

[Hook]
Slow down, I ain't in a hurry, I'm having too much fun
Yeah baby, I love life, I love life
Day by day, you see me getting paid, never gon' stop, never gon' change
Yeah baby, I love life, I love my life

[Outro]
Yeah, I wish I never had to leave
I wish this club never closed
And I know one thing that I'mma always do me
And never be what you want
And I know one thing, if I get one more drink
Then I'mma fly to the sky
And you won't see me, no more
Cause I'm so high and I don't wanna be nowhere else
