[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Hook]
Now I’m that motherfucker
Act like you don’t know, bitch
CNN, CNN
We the news like CNN
CNN, CNN
We the news like CNN, CNN

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I hear everybody talkin'
But I’ve never been a fan of a snitch nigga
Uh, I get your girlfriend talkin
Cause she ain’t never been with a rich nigga
With the clique in the VIP try and turn up
Lookin for a couple bad bitches with the turn out
Keep it G and I’m never gon' change
Champagne bottle match all my change
It’s a dough world, go get it from the bottom like a gofer
Might pop off but you gotta go first, never been this high
That gang bitch up all night
Let me live my life, let me live my life
Everything green, like I’m lookin through Sprite
We eatin over here, lookin' like you need a bite
Way back then I thought it was all hype


[Hook]
Now I’m that motherfucker
Act like you don’t know, bitch
CNN, CNN
We the news like CNN
CNN, CNN
We the news like CNN, CNN


[Verse 2]
Uh, I got everybody talkin'
On the internet bout a nigga outfit
Yeah, seen soon as I walked in
These shoes ain’t even come out yet
Turn on these bitches like an outlet
All these thots can’t work in the office
You ain’t talkin bout money then I’m off that
Hit a lick now I’m headed to the auction
Try and double up, know I’m ballin
Build like a motherfuckin carpenter
Ones on the floor like a carpet, fuck
Let me live my life, let me live my life
Go on, put the bottle to your lips like a mic
Neck full of lights, cameras action
Act like you don’t know the name, better ask bitch

[Hook]
Now I’m that motherfucker
Act like you don’t know, bitch
CNN, CNN
We the news like CNN
CNN, CNN
We the news like CNN, CNN


[Outro]
Yeah

Now I’m that motherfucker
Act like you don’t know, bitch
