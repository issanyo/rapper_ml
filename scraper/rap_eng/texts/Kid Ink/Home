[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
I've been travelling down this road, I swear its just taking to long
Man it feels like I'll never get home, it feels like I'll never get home
So when everything's moving slow, I just turn up my radio
Man it feels like I'll never get home, I'll never get home, I'll never get home
It feels like I'll never get home
It feels like I'll never get home

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I said I'm so far gone
Sun in my eyes but I'm riding in the storm
It's a cold world, you need more then a sweater
Try make it through the weather
I gotta get it together man
Feel a little bit of pressure, but this is my calling
If you didn't get the message that
I'm riding through the death and I'm praying that in the afterlife
That they mention my name like an add reply
Couldn't walk in my shoes, stand clear of my lane
So fly, each step's like landing a plane
One hand on the wheel, other hand in my brain
With one foot to the gas and a trunk of propane fuels the fire in my veins

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
I've been travelling down this road, I swear its just taking to long
Man it feels like I'll never get home, it feels like I'll never get home
So when everything's moving slow, I just turn up my radio
Man it feels like I'll never get home, I'll never get home, I'll never get home
It feels like I'll never get home
It feels like I'll never get home

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Couldn't be long now
Riding high, hoping I don't fall down
I was MVP of the away team
When I make it home its going down like a bass string, huh
I got my feet to the pavement
Heard success taste's sweet like pastries
But look around all I see is bitter faces
Fakeness, actors shoulda been an agent
Now tell me is it really worth it
No suit and tie but I work this
Big fish in the sea y'all urchin's
Until they tap out, it's no mercy

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
I've been travelling down this road, I swear its just taking to long
Man it feels like I'll never get home, it feels like I'll never get home
So when everything's moving slow, I just turn up my radio
Man it feels like I'll never get home, I'll never get home, I'll never get home
It feels like I'll never get home
It feels like I'll never get home
