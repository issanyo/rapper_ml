[Chorus]
I pull up in that Benz like
Whoo look what you made me do
Shittin on you and your man like
Whoo look what you made me do
20 bottles in the ace like
Whoo look what you made me do
I copped me the roli and flooded the face like
Whoo look what you made me do
Whoo look what you made me do
Whoo look what you made me do
All of my niggas came up with me rich like
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Came up from nothing that's ? like bitch
Look what you made me do

[Verse 1]
Bitch it's this paper view
Just watch what this paper do
We ain't got nun to say
So please don't get it confused
I came up from food stamps and walk in the bank till they give me the loot
So walking in Paris with me and my niggas smoking plus ?
Car ain't got on no roof
Bitches ain't got on no clothes
Pull up outside in that coupe
And parking lot pimp to ?
Look what you made me do
I heard I would make me too
I heard that she pulled me a 4
We poppin and ?

[Pre-Chorus]
Am back on my bullshit in the back of the club
With a ? bottles ? asap
I copped me a roli and flooded the face
I pull up I shut it down ? in your face
Back on my bullshit in the back of the club
With a ? bottles ? asap

I pull up I shut it down ? in your face

[Chorus]
I pull up in that Benz like
Whoo look what you made me do
Shittin on you and your man like
Whoo look what you made me do
20 bottles in the ace like
Whoo look what you made me do
I copped me the roli and flooded the face like
Whoo look what you made me do
Look what you made me do

All of my niggas came up with me rich like
Look what you made me do

Came up from nothing that's ? like bitch

[Verse 2]
Woa look what you made me do
All of this liquor it made me loose
Woes are not in my use
Hoes they all wanna choose
Please don't turn on the light switch
Got these ? working the night switch
And smoking the haze no ?
Am keeping it cool till I'm sick
Nigga no question no high fit
The badest bitch you know am with
Love her and know that she like when I
Hit it from back like ?
Leave the bedroom like a crime scene
Look what you made me do
Young nigga feeling like OJ
And lately the bitch saying I got the juice

[Chorus]
I pull up in that Benz like
Whoo look what you made me do
Shittin on you and your man like
Whoo look what you made me do
20 bottles in the ace like
Whoo look what you made me do
I copped me the roli and flooded the face like
Whoo look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
All of my niggas came up with me rich like
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Came up from nothing that's ? like bitch
