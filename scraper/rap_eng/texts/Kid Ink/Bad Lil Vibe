[Chorus]
You move just like a tire swing
I swear you got the real thing
Not the type to conversate
The baddest if I do say so myself
You sexy on your own
Don't need no help
I had to say excuse me
But you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
You's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
Said you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
I had to say excuse me

[Verse 1]
Can I take you home?
Baby, let me get some time
Second hand from the smoke, roll up
Forget about whoever did you wrong
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Like it's Comme des Gar√ßons, hold up
We been gettin' to it ever since the movie started
And now we finally made it to you favorite part where
I'll be Joker, you'll play Harley
Had to put you on the squad, see

[Chorus]
You move just like a tire swing
I swear you got the real thing
Not the type to conversate
The baddest if I do say so myself
You sexy on your own
Don't need no help
I had to say excuse me
But you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
You's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
Said you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
I had to say excuse me
But you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
You's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
Said you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
You's a bad lil' vibe

[Verse 2]
And we so high
Don't you ever kill the vibe
Undercover, you a freak
But you wearin' your disguise
Baby, listen to your mind
You should take your own advice
I don't really play no games
Less that shit come with a price, woo
I know you need me here to boost your ego, yeah
Baby, you so bad, plus the evil
When we roll, I'll be Clyde, be my Bonny, yeah
We'll hit the bank then hit the mall, see

[Chorus]
You move just like a tire swing
I swear you got the real thing
Not the type to conversate
The baddest if I do say so myself
You sexy on your own
Don't need no help
I had to say excuse me
But you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
You's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
Said you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
I had to say excuse me
But you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
You's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
Said you's a bad lil' vibe, ooh yeah
You's a bad lil' vibe

[Outro]
And we so high
And we so high
And we so
Yeah
You move just like a
That super psycho
I see your friends
Your crew just like you
I'll get you high like
Top of the Eiffel
Give me a chance
Ain't no tellin' what I might do
When we alone
When you perform
Girl, I'm a fan
Just do your dance
Just do your dance
And let me know when I give you my hands
Yeah
