[Hook: Kid Ink and Eric Bellinger]
Okay baby, outfit crazy, outfit crazy, outfit crazy
Fresh, fresh
Okay baby, outfit crazy, outfit crazy, outfit crazy
You know I'm fresh, fresh

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay baby, outfit crazy
Make a nigga change clubs just like Jay-Z
Eatin' over here, yeah, everything gravy
Alumni rapping, ya'll ball JV
Uh, pass that, cheese like a lab rat
New kicks, new chick, I won't ever back track
Eyes on me, got me staying like what's that
Feeling like the shit, put a finger to your moustache
Okay baby, outfit crazy, see you running out, I got a bush like Grady
Self named nigga, so you can never make me
I don't need a stylist every time you see me, I'm

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Okay baby, outfit crazy, I don't do much, make you niggas look lazy
Take a picture then frame it like Banksy
On the blind side wearing everything you ain't seen
Ball like 2k, clothes need a passport, straight from the UK.
Gucci tax free, Louie V tax free, where they do that at, swear you niggas tacky
Okay baby, outfit crazy, even in the dark its clear in HD
Flyest nigga running through the city like a safety
Need a pair of wings, cause every time you see me I'm

[Hook]
