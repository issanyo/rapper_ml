[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay, right off top take one to the head no warning
Shot live fast die young don’t mourn’
If I don't make it through the night
Or should I say the morning?
Beast mode how a nigga feeling this moment
Made my mind, I make history
Now I make it rain cause I made it through the storm and
Storm in the buildin' like the shit is my apartment
Meant it when I said I need a minute 'til we finish
Section so deep, motherfucker barely fittin’
Feelin' myself, fuck a hating nigga feelings
Fill up my cup, to the motherfuckin’ ceilin’
Better cuff your chick before I Pittsburgh Steel-er, nigga
All on my old shit, you old niggas expired
It keeps my inspired, stay rollin’ up fire
Been cookin’ no timer, no time outs or time off
Often we passing 'round money like offering
Bossin’ in this bitch, boss bitch know how to work
Work hard for that money baby shit could be worse
Worst lie ever told, is that I wasn't the truth
Truth be told, I never seen a loss or a truce
Too loose blunt hittin’ like a train choo choo
Proof shows, ain't nothing else I really got to prove
Still sleeping on me now, I’mma ring the alarm
Right along with the bomb, I’mma drop on your noggin'

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Man, I'm just trynna double up though
Double cupped, on my double up flow

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Got two in the air two eyes to the throne
Can't have too much, need more
All I know is dream big and live large (x3)
All I know is dream big, we livin’ large motherfucker look

[Verse: Da Kid Gowie]
I was told to dream big, you better believe that's what I'mma do
I'm the sickest in the game, can't kiss a girl without spreading the flu
I dismantle instrumentals whenever I'm ripping it up in the stu
You could say I handle business, I don't need no tie or suit
Because I'm on one
If rap's a sport I'mma top 5 recruit.
Kid inked his whole body, I'm using this ink to make hits in the booth
Bad woman everywhere, I don't know which one I'mma choose
I can only fit one? Naw, they can lap up in the coupe
Big head like Betty Boop, they know exactly how I like it
Treat my dick like stick shifts, except that it ain't hard to ride it
If I take 'em to the crib, we can have a few ménages
Then it's back to the money, where the Eagle and the Eye is
And I promise that I ain't lying
Time is constantly flying
If you ain't living then you're dying
So money is my proof of life, shout out to Meg Ryan

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Man, I'm just trynna double up though
Double cupped, on my double up flow

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Got two in the air two eyes to the throne
Can't have too much, need more
All I know is dream big and live large (x3)
All I know is dream big, we livin’ large motherfucker look
