[Chorus: 2AM Club]
You strip me down, you left me crawl
Hot as a rock, inside my soul
This smoky room, where loves a ghost
I’m setting out in ashes baby
Give me back my fire, fire, fire
I want back my fire baby
Give me back my fire, fire, fire
I want back my fire baby
Give me back my fire, fire, fire
I want back my fire baby

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, can’t say I didn’t used to ignite you
Now all we do is spite but
Girl I still need that fire
Looking like where the fuck is my life till now
I know you miss all the nights
Up late the night, you’re so so shit like
SO high ain’t think you fall into the height
But ready to move now, is just so you can hike girl
I’m sorry the only way you notice
Getting right to the dough, soon as I hit the dough
I’m trying to give you the world
Your friends to kill for, red bottom to floor
Mack tripping and go
The way it look it ain’t always what it seem
What I gotta do, see you don’t wanna lay
It’s too many girls that you’re the one to me
What you’re scared of, don’t run away

[Chorus: 2AM Club]
You strip me down, you left me crawl
Hot as a rock, inside my soul
This smoky room, where loves a ghost
I’m setting out in ashes baby
Give me back my fire, fire, fire
I want back my fire baby
Give me back my fire, fire, fire
I want back my fire baby
Give me back my fire, fire, fire
I want back my fire baby
