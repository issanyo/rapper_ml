[Verse 1]
Cock back and unload
I leave you niggas leaking like Amber Rose
Tell me what I gotta prove ask round who be killing shit
Every time's game time, this is just a scrimmage bitch
White tee, black shades, no I'm not discriminate
Headed to a show, break a leg, Shaun Livingston
Money's all I talk, so there's nothing left to implement
Bitch it's the Alumni, army, militant
All these hoes love me, watch me play them like an instrument
I'm 'bout to leave the club with 2 dimes that's a 10 for 10
Tripping nigga, better watch your temperament
Bitch ugly you living like pimping since Pippen been pimpin , yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said we don't care about rules
You see I'm acting a fool, it ain't nothing new
I don't know about you
But this what I do, this what I do
I don't know about you
But this what I do, this what I do
I don't know about you
But this what I do, this what I do

[Verse 2]
High by any means, faded as I wanna be
Way out of your league, give a fuck about your commentary
Honestly, see me on your property
Make sure you coming at me properly
I got a list full of haters, room for another
Hardhead roll another one, thats my brother
And we're smoking on that loud, tryna keep it subtle
Know we get it popping, didn't mean to bust your bubble
Where the fuck was you when we was coming up?
Now everybody on my line but I don't own nothing
Let me teach them how to grind I could show them something
One button, aw look like I done started something

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Cock back and reload
Live the rock star life like Axel Rose
Niggas down to the tee, I hardly would agree
How you in my city acting more Hollywood than me
When you ain't never been here, you ain't really live that
Get around my goonies and you nigga acting fragile
Bitch ass, I will shit right where you sit at
Tie 'em with a knot and give you all the business

[Chorus]
