[Intro: Kid Ink]
Money and the power
Once you get a 'lil they just want to take you down (cause)
I got the money and the power
Once you get a 'lil they just want to take you down (cause)
We’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on?
Really ain’t nothing, I could drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
It’s nothing, nothing to get it poppin’
Wanna roll. Roll up, up, and away
Here we go now
Now Martin had a dream, I’ve been dreamin’ ’bout gold
Tell ‘em I just wanna shine, and I gotta let it show
Show up on the scene, walk right through the door
Got a nigga on repeat, it’s my double up flow
Vibrate the whole building, I ain’t ringing through your phone
Waiting ’til the smoke clear, can you see me through the fog?
Fall back, it could go all bad
We be goin’ hard with your ex, oh Tic-tac
Tacky motherfuckers must not be hip yet
Life is a bitch, but I bet I get that bitch wet

[Hook: Kid Ink]
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on? (Yeah)
Really ain’t nothing, I can drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Ma-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down (cause)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
But I’m ready, ready, so you can tell ‘em to bring it on
On a whole other level of high, no phone
Foes all mad ’cause the dough don’t fold
Forget about your plans, we ain’t leavin’ ’til it close
Close to the top, I can barely see the ground
With the whole team here, everybody get around
Look like a parade when we’re coming through your town
One hand to the sky, two feet to the ground
Wait, can’t stop ’til the sun’s up
Party everywhere ever since I got my funds up
Yup, pray to God it never run out
Off that loud, burnin’ rubber, need to slow it down

[Hook: Kid Ink]
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on? (Yeah)
Really ain’t nothing, I can drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Ma-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down (cause)

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Mon-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down
Mon-money and the power
Once you get a little, they just wanna take you down
That, that’s how it is
When you fuckin’ with me, you should know how it goes
That, that’s how it is
I’ve got a bottle in my hand and a pocket full of dough

[Outro: Kid Ink]
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
Can’t get enough, what is you on? (Yeah)
Really ain’t nothing, I can drop that
Wake up in the morning, make it all back
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
We, we’ve been going hard for too long
