[Intro]
1...2...Pull up on you
3...4...Lamborghini door
5...6...running no sticks
7...8...nowhere in your lane
Becky!

[Chorus]
We made it through the silent hill
Turn my moves to a fairy tale with my doll just like Annabelle
Led my dreams Freddy-filled
Watch them scream trap their faces
Stay round trees just like Jason
See some stranger things am I crazy
In the Hotel feeling baked click boom and made it bitch

[Verse 1]
Looking like I lead investigations
Got my chick right out immigration
Am feeling bad today body a bag today
Say she afraid of ghosts so I pull up and drag the Wraith
You know we walk the hill niggas the walking dead
House on top of the hill your money talk is scared
Slay slay slay
I Ak that rose Tattoos like mask on face
They're trying to take my place
I ain't the 1...2 pull up on you
You better run don't ever sleep
Know where you wait onto the sun
Under the moon turn to a beast
I'm on a mood she on a creep
Pouring Patr√≥n for the deceased
Where I'm from you can't be scared of no nightmares

[Chorus]
We made it through the Silent Hill
Turn my moves to a fairy tale with my doll just like Annabelle
Led my dreams Freddy-filled
Watch them scream trap their faces
Stay round trees just like Jason
See some stranger things am I crazy
In the Hotel feeling baked click boom and made it bitch

[Verse 2]
It's bloody bloody Mary Mary in the mirror
Say my name three times and watch them hoes appear
Now here is Jonny in the hall chopping down your door
Little nigga with the ship ? door
Childs play turn this bitch to a purge night
? boys ? fuck y'all welcome you to Poltergeist
Tear that bitch off leatherface and me no need no chain saw
Walk in here like the lost boys and you know what the fuck we came for
S-s-silence to  that Lamborghini parking bitch
I'm in a sunken place you love her
Better guard your bitch big fishes on some Jaws shit
Make movies of some songs shit
You had you a cool run I'll be right back cause this our shit

[Chorus]
We made it through the Silent Hill
Turn my moves to a fairy tale with my doll just like Annabelle
Led my dreams Freddy-filled
Watch them scream trap their faces
Stay round trees just like Jason
See some stranger things am I crazy
In the Hotel feeling ? click boom and made it bitch

[Outro]
1...2...Pull up on you
3...4...Lamborghini door
5...6...running no sticks
7...8...nowhere in your lane
Becky!
