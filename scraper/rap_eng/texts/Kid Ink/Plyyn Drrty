[Verse 1]
I put you on, I put you in
You in the game, you and your friends
And now we at the foul line cuz you playin' dirty
Need two shots, cuz you playin' dirty
How you fit that in yo pants, know yo ass hurtin'
Know what you doin', your plans workin'
That smile chandelier and your rug Persian
Excuse me for talkin' nasty
You know we gettin' high as can be
You the only one that understand me
Sometimes you ain't ready for that D, so

[Hook]
You playin' dirty
You, you playin' dirty
You, cuz you playin' dirty
You playin', you playin', you playin', you playin'
You playin' dirty
You playin', you playin', you playin', you playin'
You playin' dirty, cuz you playin' dirty
You playin', you playin', you playin', you playin', you playin'
You playin' dirty
You playin', you playin', you playin', you playin'
You playin' dirty, cuz you playin' dirty

[Verse 2]
Can't feel your face, Hollywood nova
King, got that business if you actin' nosy
Okay, watch how the night gon' pan slowly
Out in Beverley Hills, nigga act so folly
It feel like we just fuckin' won Oscar
It feel like we just fuckin' left the Grammy's
Damn, this afterparty really goin' up, up
Only the main bitches showin' up, up
And you still tryna play them, play this game
You playin' dirty baby, I can play the, play the same
Make you say my name, I'm just sayin', so

[Hook]
You playin' dirty
You, you playin' dirty
You, cuz you playin' dirty
You playin', you playin', you playin', you playin'
You playin' dirty
You playin', you playin', you playin', you playin'
You playin' dirty, cuz you playin' dirty
You playin', you playin', you playin', you playin', you playin'
You playin' dirty
You playin', you playin', you playin', you playin'
You playin' dirty, cuz you playin' dirty

[Outro]
I'm sayin', I'm sayin', I'm sayin', I'm sayin'
Again, again, again, and again, alright, alright
I'm sayin', I'm sayin', I'm sayin', I'm sayin'
When I get you to the back girl we gon' do it
Again, again, again, and again
