[Intro: Kid Ink]
Ah yeah
Just come and take a ride with me
Slide with me (Kid Ink)
Love to love, ya ya love to love
Think I found my diamond in the rough
Shining, might just switch up the climate
His and hers, you know what the time is

[Verse 1: Olivia Noelle]
2 AM in Central Park
Same old city with you feels like, paradise
Talking ’til we close the bar
Love how you love me with your eyes, so alive

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Noelle]
Racing through streets locked hands and chemicals inside my body
I need to know when it comes crashing down

[Chorus: Olivia Noelle]
When I can’t hold the wheel
Will you drive for me? (Drive for me)
When all I feel is low, will you get high for me? (High for me)
How hard would you try for me?
If they put you on the stand
Would you lie for me?
Would you put the whole world on hold for me?
How real, how real is it?
When all I feel is low
Will you get high for me? (High for me)

[Verse 2: Olivia Noelle]
If you ever fucked up
I would empty all my accounts
Bail you out
Yeah
If you’re ever sinking fast
I would empty both my lungs out, to keep you breathing, breathing

[Pre-Chorus: Olivia Noelle]
Racing through streets locked hands and chemical inside my body
I need to know when it comes crashing down

[Chorus: Olivia Noelle]
When I can’t hold the wheel
Will you drive for me? (Drive for me)
When all I feel is low, will you get high for me? (High for me)
How hard would you try for me?
If they put you on the stand
Would you lie for me?
Would you put the whole world on hold for me?
How real, how real is it?
When all I feel is low
Will you get high for me? (High for me)

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
It’s Kid Ink
Baby
Let’s roll one up and blow one to the ceiling
Ooowee, it’s such a wonderful feeling
To lay my hands on you like I’m healing
I could get right behind your wheel and drop the top and jump over the front door
You giving me the go, I’m like “Run, Forrest”
Hopped inside the whip and said “What’s the button for?”
Whip so fast, wind opened up her button more

[Chorus: Olivia Noelle and Kid Ink]
I love the way you ride
Will you drive for me? (Drive for me)
Yeah, oh
When all I feel is low (Woo)
Will you get high for me? (High for me)
C’mon
How hard would you try for me?
If they put you on the stand
Would you lie for me? (Ooh)
Would you put the whole world on hold for me? (Yeah)
How real, how real is it?
When all I feel is low (Woo)
Will you get high for me? (High for me)
