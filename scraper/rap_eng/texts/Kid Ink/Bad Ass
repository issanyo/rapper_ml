I'm feeling like the man of the hour, tear down that house
I'm throwin' this money, like it's no runnin' out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get in the aisle
And drop it down the pole, like it's a fire?
Now let me see just what you doin' with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you movin' with your bad ass
Let me see just what you doin' with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you movin' with your bad ass

I'm feeling like a man of the hour, host of the evening
But girl, it's your show, now bring it back, rerun
I got pockets of hundreds, they say that change is irrelevant
Lookin' up in the sky, I said I love watching you elevate
High as you ever been, we're gettin' hella bent
Ball so hard, I deserve me a Leatherman
Man, let me see that cake, cake, cake, like Edmund's
Ass up, gon' take it down like a sedative
That's a negative, ain't nobody wetter than her
Better get familiar like a motherfuckerin' relative
Though you see the fireworks, you lookin' where my section is
All this money fallin' in the air like it's confetti, bitch

I'm feeling like the man of the hour, tear down that house
I'm throwin' this money, like it's no runnin' out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get in the aisle
And drop it down the pole, like it's a fire?
Now let me see just what you doin' with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you movin' with your bad ass
Let me see just what you doin' with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you movin' with your bad ass

Now go ahead with that bad ass, and fast cash, right, dash past
Them silicones, that bad ass, got cheese out, the rat trap
Real late night, no cat naps, you so acrobatic
Just move it to the bass slap, the bass slap like the mackest
No question we turnt up, workin' on my fourth cup
Been throwin' all this money like the ass is for purchase
Very important person, don't take it too personal
Got more bottles than homies, it's a movie, ready for the show!
