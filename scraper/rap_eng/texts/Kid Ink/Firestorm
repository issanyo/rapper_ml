[Hook]
Flame, lighter on, got a flame, lighter on
Got a flame, lighter on, got it bout to start a firestorm
Got a flame, lighter on, got a flame, lighter on
Got a flame, lighter on, got it bout to start a firestorm

I burn it down, burn it down, burn it down, burn it down
It's goin round, goin round, you see it goin round
I got that flame lighter on, got a flame lighter on
Got a flame lighter on, got it bout to start a firestorm

[Verse 1]
Now you know I got that flame on
Bout to burn it down inside this bitch like a volcano
Too high for TV, need to come and put a nigga on cable
Roll up, roll up till a nigga eyes red like Kano
You don't want no combat, fuck papers and contracts
Got 'em high of contact with a blunt longer than Cadillacs
Lighters up, lights off, one hit of this, mind gone
Put you on the floor like pine sol
Don't need no scale nigga, eyeball it
I - start a firestorm, on your head like hot rain
And burn rubber on mu-fuckas with a gas tank full of propane
Ridin round with that heater attitude like I feel no pain
Deaf off that loud if you ever heard my name
You know

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm high as fuck, trying not to fall
Your girl drunk trying not to call
Better cuff your chick and abide the law
I her it once, but I swear to God we tried it all.
Flame on, I ain't even gotta say more
But all my niggas go Akon, that A-Team and we A.W.O.L
Standing on the couch got me feeling eight feet tall
Eyes on me, but I swear that I can't see y'all, keep off
Piro addict, smoking way more than average
Fired up to the max, yeah you can smell it in my fabrics. The-
Kush is my cologne and the champagne is my passion
Might roll one up, but I don't know if I could pass it

[Hook]
