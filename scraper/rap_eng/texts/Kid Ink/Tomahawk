[Intro]
Hundred cars got the city, yeah yeah
Woo, yeah yeah
Hey

[Chorus]
Drop down, tomahawk tops off
Hundred cars got the city blocked off
Try and catch me slippin', but I never fall
Pocket rockets poppin', we could let 'em off, yeah
Drop down, tomahawk tops off
Hundred cars got the city blocked off
Try and catch me slippin', but I never fall
Pocket rockets, we could let 'em off, yeah

[Verse 1]
You don't want no war, boy you get destroyed
Talk that shit like 5,0 but I hit like Floyd
Niggas up in space, I just feel the void
Black hoodie, grim reaper, watch me kill the noise
Panic view, and that Panamera painted blue
Push the button, see the super sport and baby zoomin'
Addin' fire to fuel, man, they just live illusions
They ain't get no bread, dog, they can't have no gluten
Me no lack me no cap, boy
Tryna get like me and said you're back, boy
Hundred of them, hundred of them
Money like MJ the way that it spin
Swear that these niggas don't want me to win
Feel like this season, I'm huntin' again

[Chorus]
Drop down, tomahawk tops off (Yeah)
Hundred cars got the city blocked off (Yeah)
Try and catch me slippin', but I never fall (Yeah)
Pocket rockets poppin', we could let 'em off (Yeah)
Drop down, tomahawk tops off (Yeah)
Hundred cars got the city blocked off (Yeah)
Try and catch me slippin', but I never fall (Yeah)
Pocket rockets, we could let 'em off (Yeah)

[Interlude]
I don't know what the fuck you put in this shit man
I swear to God this some whole other outer space
I'm high, nigga, man I'm tryna land this motherfucker
Boy I'm high as fuck
I know they call you rocket ship and all that shit, but, whoo

[Verse 2]
Back with that resurrect, you niggas overslept
Way that I regulate, feel like I never left
LA I represent, mixin' that bag, ooh, with the medicine
Baby girl don't wanna smoke
Lookin' for snow, mountain like Everest
Switchin' the tone, swear that they phony
Post somethin' fake 'cause I never been
I hear you talkin', if it's a problem
Know that with me, you won't settle it
Livin' the life of an icon, walk in this bitch like a giant
Ball like I ain't got no time-outs
Diggin' a hole you can't climb out
Cash, these niggas is hypebeasts, they only livin' on IG
My main was never a sidepiece (No)
Got her the 'Rari and Siamese
Hit the button, watch the dash lift (Smashin')
Roll me up so I don't crash this

[Chorus]
Drop down, tomahawk tops off (Yeah)
Hundred cars got the city blocked off (Yeah)
Try and catch me slippin', but I never fall (Yeah)
Pocket rockets poppin', we could let 'em off (Yeah)
Drop down, tomahawk tops off (Yeah)
Hundred cars got the city blocked off (Yeah)
Try and catch me slippin', but I never fall (Yeah)
Pocket rockets, we could let 'em off (Yeah)
