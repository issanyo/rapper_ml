Let me get you high for the moment
Fuck five what im smoking Im'a need a dub on it
Know that swisher's all we smokin, leave the paper for the toilet
Gotta tip and a molly and a bitch that keep it rollin uh
Know you smell me when we rollin up
Me and miss marry jane yea we so in love

Over seas snuck a OZ over customs
What you got on it? show me the dough nigga
Were im from you dont drop you dont smoke with us
Me too on the double, if you trynna match up like a puzzle holla at me

(Hook)
No Sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
No Sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
No Sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here
And if it ain't OG I ain't even trynna hit wuh!
No Sticks no seeds we ain't stressin over here

[Justin Sticks]
Got the money in the back
Got these bitches on my Lap
While my eyes were sitting low
She would go and throw back

Tell you what you didn't know
I Ain't talking regi leaf
You ain't talking OZ
My strain is worth an OG

{KID INK SAMPLE}

I was talking bout that Strappannaberry Kush, Berry Kush
That Baltimore loud, worth a though
By da berry Kush


[Kid INK sample & Justin Sticks]
Higher than kite
No strings Attatched
You ain't gotta whip and work
Baby go and bring it back

Smoke it down to the ground
You ain't gotta miss this
All my niggas round me
Got trees like its Christmas

[Justin Sticks]
Just rocking with treble
Call me nigga with marry
Sparkling crystals in a bezzle

My girl

Breaking down that Barney Rebel
Both the girls are bye and hi
But they always saying hello

(Hook)
