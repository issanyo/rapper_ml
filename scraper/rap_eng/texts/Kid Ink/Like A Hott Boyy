[Intro: Young Thug]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I just pull up to the spot, boy
Like I'm fresh up off the lot, boy
Niggas say I do a lot, boy
Cause I'm spendin' cash money like a hot boy
Stop thinkin' you the man cause you not, boy
You be lookin' like the cops, boy
See your bitch and I bet she gettin' copped, boy
Cause I'm spendin' cash money like a hot boy

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Big time, big time, I'm feelin' fresh as Mannie
Ever since I told them bitches, "Put aside your panties"
Show me something it' ain't nothin' but a couple grams
Sippin' on this champagne, smack her with my other hand, boy
I just pull up on the scene and never seen shit
But I still feel like a bum
Cause ain't no place and ain't no ceilin' in here
Side niggas hatin' bitches blockin' like Kareem and him
Rollin' with this nigga here, everything you dream is real
Please believe me, we do this shit for no reason
Baby, welcome to the fast life, switch gears, now I'm spinnin'
In my lane, Ruff Rydin' like the LOX, boy
Stop drop, shut 'em down, open up shop, boy

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I just pull up to the spot, boy
Like I'm fresh up off the lot, boy
Niggas say I do a lot, boy
Cause I'm spendin' cash money like a hot boy
Stop thinkin' you the man cause you not, boy
You be lookin' like the cops, boy
See your bitch and I bet she gettin' copped, boy
Cause I'm spendin' cash money like a hot boy

[Verse 2: Kid Ink & Bricc Baby Shitro]
Hundreds, fifties, I just flip 'em every mornin'
Like they pancakes in the kitchen
See me drippin', see me pourin'
Cut the gas then I floor it, pull up to the spot
They aimin' for the target, I'm Kennedy in the drop
Everybody get your roll on, smash smash, nigga
Cash money, cash money, talkin' fast fast, bitch
Guerilla warfare but Juveniles gon' smash, nigga
Pull up to the spot with two-hundred on the dash, damn
The AP done nearly broke my wrist
I whip it fast, whip it fast, I gave my wrist a ticket
When you hear that, "Brrr, brrr", know I got no chickens
I took some bands on your head and then you leave my hood

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I just pull up to the spot, boy
Like I'm fresh up off the lot, boy
Niggas say I do a lot, boy
Cause I'm spendin' cash money like a hot boy
Stop thinkin' you the man cause you not, boy
You be lookin' like the cops, boy
See your bitch and I bet she gettin' copped, boy
Cause I'm spendin' cash money like a hot boy

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Cash money, Young gettin' that cash money
Supercharger on the 'Vette now I look like a crash dummy
$50,000 on a Porsche, she ain't said nothin'
Hey, yeah nigga, I became a breadwinner
I've never said nothin' for the fetty, can I rub ya?
Foreign shoes they give me bunions
I blowin' O's like a Funyun
ABC, all 'bout cummin'
Nigga cannot act tough, know he not, boy
You my target with a dot on your eye, boy
Imma buy, I'm not leasin' it
I throw my dick gon' feature it
I'm in Memphis, no Bleek, lil bitch
Have her, I don't want keep the bitch
I'm screamin' attack gang
And I got birds you know the rest, man, Batgang

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I just pull up to the spot, boy
Like I'm fresh up off the lot, boy
Niggas say I do a lot, boy
Cause I'm spendin' cash money like a hot boy
Stop thinkin' you the man cause you not, boy
You be lookin' like the cops, boy
See your bitch and I bet she gettin' copped, boy
Cause I'm spendin' cash money like a hot boy
