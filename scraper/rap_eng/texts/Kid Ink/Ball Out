Ball Out Lyrics

[Intro]
Said we ball out
We ball out
Said we ball out
We ball out
[Kid Ink Verse]
Yeah, but you will never catch me out of bounds
Or at home, it’s no guess I’m probably out of town
Cause my weight game is so Dwayne Wade
Getting money checks looking like a sweepstake
Pull up in a space ship star wars fly
With an all back diamond chain from the dark side
Lot of cheese like Swiss
Tell’em that it’s your time
Moneys all I talk and you ain't telling nothing like mine

[Hook]X2
Man look at my chain man
Look at my ring man
This ice around my neck got me looking insane man
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
[Lil Twist Verse]
You can tell that we ball out
Go buy the mall out
We go the big money way
We never go small routes
You can tell that we ball out (ball out, ball out)
You call us
We hit your city and club and bring Barbies’ and dolls out
What you bout
This our house
And this how we does it
This young money baby never put nothin’ above it
Yeah now tell them haters fall back
I pull out that jewelry box and show them all that

[Hook]X2
Man look at my chain man
Look at my ring man
This ice around my neck got me looking insane man
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
[Lil Twist Verse]
Check, check
I do it all day like I never ever did it before
Spending my money like it grow on trees
That’s why I say bout time to dig mo’ holes (yeah)
But I’m still riding in a Rolls (yeah)
Collecting dough at my shows (yeah)
Take the dough to the crib turn them into seeds bout time to fill these holes (yeah)
Tell me what you know about me (yeah)
I earned this like a G (yeah)
T W I S T tryna go to the college and get his degree (yeah)
But the ice distract me
Diamonds so tacky
Bout to go to the mall and spend and spend like a G
Now haters Lo-Look

[Hook]X2
Man look at my chain man
Look at my ring man
This ice around my neck got me looking insane man
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
You can tell that we ball out (ball out)
We ball out (ball out)
