[Verse 1: Vee Tha Rula]
Hard to be humble but you love my ego
How you went open book, I barely read you
I'm saying, sometimes it's nice to hear the shit that you say
About how my random shit be making your day
Know you know about them alumni niggas
Them fashion killers, getting dumb, high niggas
The way we spreading like some funghi niggas
Yeah this shit is kinda awful but I'm glad that you came through to hear about all these crazy stories that you can't relate to
Shout out to Brazy, my nigga and [?] know his gang too
Grass getting blown, I think Jay brought the flame through (argh)
These niggas popping, they jaw-stopping, I'm chopping with conscience, we plotting, we jotting you off
Man the world rules us off, now you all is like we taxing niggas, [?] got it out the [?] from my feet that's connecting nigga
Diversion, niggas better get up out my faction niggas, if you niggas acting then it's action, and I do this for my motherfucking gang

[Chorus: Vee Tha Rula]
Yeah I'm all up on your radio, yeah your girl got us on her cellphone, yeah, even when im gonna rap home
That's right, I do this for my motherfucking gang
Where my niggas tell the DIE, if you with it come ride with me
Man I even got it tatted on me
That's right man, I do this for my motherfucking gang

[Verse 2: Vee Tha Rula]

We really came up from nothing just dollar menu and nuggets, order pizza don't stop at the crust we ain't got enough

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]

(It's Kid Ink, egh!)
Same niggas from the same old
Feel like I've known them since the snot nose
Know you see us in the picture with the jail pose, egh!
And you hashtag squadgoals, alumni, batgang keep it honcho, Know I could never do this shit, Han Solo
It's in my DNA, niggas that I ride with is wilder than Deonte
Look in our eyes and test when you see our face
Real recognise real, roll up, with weed our face
I ain't change had a chain before I was chased
I've been out in LA, back before it was safe
Been running around the city, looking for the wraith
Young cheetah, two seater, hear my roaring away
10-4, think some rap niggas just hit the door, raw black, tattoos and they looking like a mofucking...gang

[Chorus]
