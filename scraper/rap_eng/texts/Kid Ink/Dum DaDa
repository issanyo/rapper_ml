[Verse 1: Pia Mia]
Boy, you got me hotter than the summer in LA
No one takes me farther, do me every single way
Way you give it to me make me want it every day
When you beat, beat, beat it, feel like dum dada da day

[Hook: Pia Mia]
Dum dada da day, dum dada da day
When you beat, beat, beat it, all I ever wanna say
Dum dada da day, dum dada da day
When you beat, beat, beat it, feel like dum dada da day

[Verse 2: Pia Mia]
Like it when you watch me, it's just like I'm performing
Throw away the key, I got you locked 'til the morning
Treat me like a treasure, baby, I could be your diamond
Tell me it's just us, like we're on a desert island

[Verse 3: Pia Mia & (Kid Ink)]
Boy, I'm on you grinding, like I'm milling down the slate
This predator is hungry, baby, I just want a taste
My body is a temple, you can come in just to play
When you put your hands together
Dum dada da day (oh, yeah)
Put this on replay (oh, yeah)
Love you good all day (okay)
Make this shit understood - simple
Dum dada da day, hey (I hear you)

[Hook: Pia Mia]
Dum dada da day, dum dada da day
When you beat, beat, beat it, all I ever wanna say
Dum dada da day, dum dada da day
When you beat, beat, beat it, feel like dum dada da day

[Bridge: Pia Mia]
I don't want no other
Be my chosen lover
I don't want no one else but you - simple
Dum dada da day

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
That's all you ever say
Bad girl, no, you ain't safe
See you standing there at the plate
Go ahead, you can swing my way
Dada day, 'til the night, 'til the morning, singing
Touch down and I'm wide receiving
Everything she throwing back
And we ain't even went past the stats
Ooh, na na, ooh, dada day
Looking like your momma inside there
The way you ride when you're in my lane
P-I-A going M.I.A
P-Y-T no PSA, but you so fly, need TSA
Talking dirty to Mia, you don't even know what you saying
You, you don't even know what you saying (what?)
You, you don't even know what you saying

[Hook: Pia Mia]
Dum dada da day,  dum dada da day
When you beat, beat, beat it, all I ever wanna say
Dum dada da day, dum dada da day
When you beat, beat, beat it, feel like, dum dada da day
