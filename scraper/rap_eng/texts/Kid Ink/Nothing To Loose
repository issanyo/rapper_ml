[Intro: Yamine]
Nothing to loose, nothing to loose, nothing to loose (repeat)

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I bought her clothes, new shoes, new phones
New crib girl I put you on
I've been paying these bills
I've been keeping it real
But it still don't change how you feel
That girl got it all but she still wants more
That girl got it all but she still wants more
That girl got it all

[Verse 1: Yamine]
Yeah, girl there's nothing to lose
you got four set of diamond rings
what you gon' choose?
You need some intervention
I need some new digits
cuz I've been out here workin' hard
cookin' in the kitchen
since Eight grade
I was given an A
An A in romance
and an A for my glaze
I provide for you almost every single day,
but you are still complaining hard
now I'm tired in this place
I've been going to store to store
and what the heck
your still asking more
Now I'm mad and the lights now on
and you still ungrateful
go find you a home
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,
go find you a home

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I bought her clothes, new shoes, new phones
New crib girl I put you on
I've been paying these bills
I've been keeping it real
But it still don't change how you feel
That girl got it all but she still wants more
That girl got it all but she still wants more
That girl got it all

[Verse 2: Yamine]
Studio time
to studio time
working day and night
to keep up my rhymes
no keep up my lines
no keep up my finds
All this money I'm getting
I'm loosin' err-time
you don't know how it is
growing up in the house with a mother
and "three kids"
ho, you don't mind your own buz
You keep emptying my pockets, get stupid shit
I broke up with you now you coming back
Hell naw bitch, fuck I'm not getting that
I'm focused on a new girl that can act right
she's a lady
she works hard and can afford Sprite
I remember that night I gave you a limo ride
it was your birthday and you complained the whole time
yeah,
there's nothing for me to loose
Watch Kid Ink come back on this hook for you, bitch

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I bought her clothes, new shoes, new phones
New crib girl I put you on
I've been paying these bills
I've been keeping it real
But it still don't change how you feel
That girl got it all but she still wants more
That girl got it all but she still wants more
That girl got it all

[Verse 3: Yamine]
hey.
oh, I know what this is
and I know how I do my business
I worked too hard
now I'm getting no break you gone too far,
and now your my enemy
we broke up twice and now we in between
different relationships
I've been single for two months
cuz you was such a bitch
I don't care how you respond right now
I'm in love with a different girl right now
she's probably listening to this and now I'm going to leave this to her

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I bought her clothes, new shoes, new phones
New crib girl I put you on
I've been paying these bills
I've been keeping it real
But it still don't change how you feel
That girl got it all but she still wants more
That girl got it all but she still wants more
That girl got it all

hey, nothing to loose
