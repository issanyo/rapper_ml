[Intro: Kid Ink]
Kid Ink, egh
I think I found a genie in a bottle baby, with a bottle shape
And she don't have no problem representing for the team

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Ok it's feeling like I just hit the lotto, baby
32-26-34, wasted
Watch her do a dance then it get me in the game
Going hard in the paint what's my name what's my name girl
You know, I be missing that bom-bom when I'm away
I swear, when you shaking them pom-poms all I can say is

[Hook: OMI]
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 2: OMI]
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen cause she stay strong, yeah yeah
She is always in my corner right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone and they say

[Pre-Hook]
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating
I'm like no not really cause

[Hook: OMI]
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Ahh, I need her, right here where she need to be
Complimenting my style you're flyer with the Captain of the team
Now move, right, right there, hit reverse girl and back that rear
Roll it with me and then light that up and the rest is history write that, book
My cheerleader, something about her demeanor
Even though I'm off these margaritas can't none of these hoes here come between us
Shawty no regular chick, so I just take her to places she ain't know exist
So she never forget, who the man is

[Verse 4: OMI]
Oh she gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention
You're the only girl for me no I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do is just for me to pop the question

[Hook: OMI]
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
