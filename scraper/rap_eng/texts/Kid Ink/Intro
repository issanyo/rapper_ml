[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay, back up on my shit, put it in reverse
Said it's Kid Ink baby, put 'em in a hearse
Button up my shirt, watch me go to work
Take a hit from the swisher then I hit 'em where it hurts
Getting paid everyday, 15th and the 1st
Gotta bitch so bad, man it couldn't get worse
Big fish like Moby, swisher never boney
Realest nigga here, y'all just phony
All black shades, got me looking colour blind
All them niggas broke girl, you can pay them no nevermind
Since I came and took charge of the game I haven't been declined
Bet it all, sweat it out

[Chorus]
I'm all in, I'm all in
Bitch I'm all in, I'm all in

[Verse 2]
They say all work, no play
Bitch I have a house party everyday
Niggas couldn't see me with the coast guard
Come and watch me make it look good, postcard
Yeah, I'm stimulated off the reefer
Blowing up fast like I'm playing minesweeper
Killing competition got me feeling like the reaper
Balling like a motherfucker nigga don't you reach in
Cause I, leave you at the foul line
Bitch it's the Alumni, grade A, certified
Heard of I? Know it's going down like the birth rate
Tell 'em it's a movement,' bout to start a earthquake
Bitch I run the building, run and duck for cover motherfucker
I'm just tryna get some like the drummer
It ain't nothing don't see nothing don't need nothing but a a blunt
And I am good, burning up like firewood understood?

[Chorus]
I'm all in, I'm all in
Bitch I'm all in, I'm all in
