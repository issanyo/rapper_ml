[Refrain 1: Treasure Davis & Kid Ink]
No nigga, no baby
How you gon' get outta this one?
No nigga, no baby
Shoes ain't gon' do it this time
No nigga, nah baby
You can pay the rent by yourself this month
Cause I'm mad at ya
But I never can ever stay mad at ya

[Verse 1: Treasure Davis]
When you give me that look removing my clothes
And you poke it so good, no blubber just fold
Boy screamin' your name it never get old, no
And I really do try but I just can't stop it
Wake up in the morning fixin' your omelet
Make myself sick, I just wanna vomit

[Hook: Treasure Davis]
Why the fuck am I so goddamn simple?
Everything you do makes me resentful
I say I'm done for good but that depends doe
Cause I always end up wanting to kiss ya

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Wit yo bad ass lookin', bomb ass cookin'
Why would I ever wanna leave that pussy?
Don't be so pushy
I ain't no rookie to the game you playin'
Please believe what I'm sayin'
This could be so little
With all the different shit we been through
Back then everything was simple
Bitches say it's the issue now

[Refrain 2: Treasure Davis & Kid Ink]
Whoa nigga, whoa baby
Why you just now gettin' home now?
Whoa nigga, whoa baby
All of a sudden got a code on your phone now
Whoa nigga, nah baby
How you think we just supposed to get along now?
Cause I'm mad at ya
But I never can ever stay mad at ya

[Verse 3: Treasure Davis]
You be pullin' up late, bu-buzz in your pocket
Think it's all good and I'ma just drop it
That ain't my shade I left on your collar
And I really do try but I just can't stop it
Wake up in the morning fixin' your omelet
Make myself sick, I wanna just vomit

[Hook]
Why the fuck am I so goddamn simple?
Everything you do makes me resentful
I say I'm done for good but that depends doe
Cause I always end up wanting to kiss ya

[Bridge: Treasure Davis]
But in the end it ain't beneficial
You only concerned with what benefits ya
All I end up with is wet eyes and tissues
Expecting more than what you intended

[Refrain 3: Treasure Davis]
So nigga
Go and let me hear all them new excuses
So nigga
It's really time to cut all the cute shit
So nigga
You better get it right 'fore you lose it

[Hook]
Why the fuck am I so goddamn simple?
Everything you do makes me resentful
I say I'm done for good but that depends doe
Cause I always end up wanting to kiss ya
Why the fuck am I so goddamn simple?
Everything you do makes me resentful
I say I'm done for good but that depends doe
Cause I always end up wanting to kiss ya
I always end up wanting to kiss ya
