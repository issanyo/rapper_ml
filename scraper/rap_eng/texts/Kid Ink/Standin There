Yeah x3
They Say (they say)
We don't know what we got (we got)
Till it's gone (till it's gone)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
It was just another club night
Doing me not looking for a love life
Seen a pair of Jimmy Choos like club lights
Bad girl, body like a bud light

Yea, you hot shit
And now she wanna come over there and talk shit
Uhh, my games all offense
And she poison, caution
But them freaky beats said call me

How much is your love gonna cost me?
I got it all covered, like all state
Looked at me and said nigga that's all great

Uhh huh uhh huh uhh huh uhh huh
I dont heard it all before
But can you make me a star
But first I gotta see how you can perform

[Hook]
When I saw you (i couldn't believe you were)
Standing there, there, there, there
Standing there
When I saw you (i couldn't believe you were)
Standing there, there, there, there
Standing there

[Verse 2: Julian]
Yea
Baby we was all right
You want it I got it, you ain't have to ask twice
Drivin off love, steering in the right direction
Guess you made a wrong turn at the intersection

You trippin now, you on some other shit
Saying how that you heard him with another bitch
Talking bout how I played you
Girl don't you remember that I made you

Man, Baby we was living life
Too many time we could recall nights
Uhh, its amnesia
But somewhere you forgot where you came from

Uhh huh uhh huh uhh huh uhh huh
I done heard it all before
I know life ain't fair
But you made it all so clear

[Hook]
When I saw you (i couldn't believe you were)
Standing there, there, there, there
Standing there
When I saw you (i couldn't believe you were)
Standing there, there, there, there
Standing there

[Verse 3: Langston]
Two years off for my ex club night
With my bros, groupie chicks acting all up tight
Trying us like one for the night
I spy with my eye, baddie thick thighs

Familiar, pretty eyes, man no lies
Every nigga staring at her like she lookin fly
Huh, bit I show no attention walked up, no hesitation
Man, it was the girl I was penetrating

Err, I told her what was I thinking
But now I'm on the road, doing shows, you on the pole
I'm flying icy, why you standing there lookin froze
Ohh, deuce up

Uhh huh uhh huh uhh huh uhh huh
I done heard it all before
I said you ain't gotta lie boo
I didn't know I did when

[Hook]
When i, saw you (i couldn't believe you were)
Standing there, there, there, there
Standing there
When i, saw you (i couldn't believe you were)
Standing there, there, there, there
Standing there
