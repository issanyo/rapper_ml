[Intro]
Egh, yeah, okay

[Bridge]
Now, just picture me, high up with my top down
On Highland and Sunset, doing 85 on the top deck
See, step by step we walking on stars
If you're looking for some action, you ain't gotta go that far

[Chorus]
Now, just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Man, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down
I'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down
You know how it go down, you know how it go down
Might get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down

[Verse 1]
Underground, any city I come in town
It's touchdown, Hail Mary, getting to the dough like Pillsbury
All night, don't feel worried, high up is where we will be
Nah, you ain't gotta feel guilty, won't judge you, gon' be free
So pour what you want, go head, roll what you want
Fuck they say somebody walking 'round here like they somebody
Don't know what kind of day I had, with all this weight, couldn't hold my bag
Don't hold me back from my habits, live the fast life for the magic
I'm just looking 'round for the baddest Hollywood face with an ass from Dallas
Big-ass crib, nigga living in a palace
We rolling out and my hands on the wheel so tight, got a callus
Get so fabulous with everybody here, only thing that matters

[Chorus]
Now, just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Man, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down
I'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down
You know how it go down, you know how it go down
Might get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
And it's go time, I swear this feeling's like we inches from the goal line
Now or never, better make your mind
Might hit her with a line like "What's your sign?" Hit her with a glass of sparkling wine
Hit her on the ass, she might not mind, acting like a 10, look more like a 9, but
Don't be stuck up, really, how could you not see us?
Doing it big, it's obvious, you ain't gotta say much, cause
I know you're sick and tired, sick and tired of all that bullshit
Then don't be afraid, take a shot and bite the bullet
That's one in the hole, can't get enough, need one or two more
Tell 'em catch up, they're running to slow, out the gutter, I learned to bowl
And finally it's movie time to show them I play the role
Of a champion, you see the goal, light shine bright, can't see the road

[Chorus]
Now, just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Just picture me Hollywood living
Riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now, stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down
Man, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down
I'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down
You know how it go down, you know how it go down
Might get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down
