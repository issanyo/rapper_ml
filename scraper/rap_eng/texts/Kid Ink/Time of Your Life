[Intro]
You ain't gotta (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta (you ain't gotta) leave
I think I gotta...
Yeah
Kid Ink
Uhh

[Hook]
Yeah, I said
You ain't gotta (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta (you ain't gotta) leave
My bad I know this ain't usually your scene
But don't worry 'bout it girl just be your self
And I swear, I ain't gon', I ain't gon' say a thing
Gon' just, have the time of your life, time of your life
Let it go (go, go, go, go, go)
And have the time of your life, time of your life
Baby, let it show

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let me show you how we doing
Know I came through deeper than the sewer
Yeah I got my whole crew and
You could be anywhere, all around the world
But if you ain't fuckin' here, then I don't know what you doin'
I see, you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta, drink
Come swing by my table I got everything you need
Bottles, kush blowin' like a whistling referee
Take a shot don't be afraid, girl just put on for your team
Go ahead show me what you got
Take a ride, back it up, and baby park it in my lot
Said you don't even need a cup, take a bottle of Ciroc
And when you hear me yell cut
That mean take it from the top now

[Hook]
Yeah, I said
You ain't gotta (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta (you ain't gotta) leave
My bad I know this ain't usually your scene
But don't worry 'bout it girl just be your self
And I swear, I ain't gon', I ain't gon' say a thing
Gon' just, have the time of your life, time of your life
Let it go (go, go, go, go, go)
And have the time of your life, time of your life
Baby, let it show

[Verse 2]
Nah, it ain't no reason to be insecure
You sick of the same thing baby here's a cure
Just take a lane change, welcome to the fast life
Ass like that, bring it back, like the past life
Yeah, I said, you ain't gotta, you ain't gotta be so shy
We'll be up all night, no we never outta time
Feel like ain't nobody see me outta sight
Outta mind, gimme 25 to life if being fly is a crime, yeah
I'm lyin', I don't wanna go
Nowhere but the sky, feeling high as I wanna so
Come and take a ride, the Alumni honor roll
And I can put it down, take you down baby, on the low

[Hook]
Yeah, I said
You ain't gotta (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta (you ain't gotta) leave
My bad I know this ain't usually your scene
But don't worry 'bout it girl just be your self
And I swear, I ain't gon', I ain't gon' say a thing
Gon' just, have the time of your life, time of your life
Let it go (go, go, go, go, go)
And have the time of your life, time of your life
