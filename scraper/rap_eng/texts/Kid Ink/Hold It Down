[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I know that times are hard and you might need a break
Hope you can hold it down until I'm on my way
Girl I'll give you the world but until the day
Hope you can hold it down until I'm on my way
Girl I'm tryna get to you as fast as I can but until
I get there, can you hold it down girl
Hold it down girl, hold it down girl, hold it
'Til I'm on my way, hold it down girl

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Cause I'm out here, tryna get paper, map-sized, hold me down like I'm getting baptised
I can see it in your mad eyes, now I'm looking like a bad guy
A little change in my pocket don't change my heart, you should slow down, hit a break and park
Cause you coming at me in the wrong way, don't waste time and throw it all away
So soon, pent-house rooms, high heeled shoes, girl it's not an excuse
But I got shit to do like a plumber
See you when the sun up, this summer

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I know that times are hard and you might need a break
Hope you can hold it down until I'm on my way
Girl I'll give you the world but until the day
Hope you can hold it down until I'm on my way
Girl I'm tryna get to you as fast as I can but until
I get there, can you hold it down girl
Hold it down girl, hold it down girl, hold it
'Til I'm on my way, hold it down girl

[Verse 2: Jon Connor]'
Yeah, I am on my way, head stronger, I hold my weight
With the flow, I hold my own and on my back I hold my state
I can't help but eat these rappers cause they shit-list on my plate
Killing shit, they can't see me 'til I see the pearly gates
Look, haters used the ammo that gon' turn me into Rambo
Turn the beat on and the heat on, watch me murder shit at random
Man first the haters doubt me based on the shit they know about me
I'm the one, now they feel me in they stomach like an outie
I ain't never made excuses, I just went and made a movement
The flow gotta be crazy, being broke will make you losing
Nowadays niggas ain't real, I stay away from illusions
Now I'm in the position to make a million making music
And I will because I'm ill and there ain't no cure for popping pills
And I got drive, you ain't not no wheels, holla at girls if you got my skills
Look, all these niggas pissed, they could feel it in their bladder
But I've learned that my opinion is the only one that matters

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
I know that times are hard and you might need a break
Hope you can hold it down until I'm on my way
Girl I'll give you the world but until the day
Hope you can hold it down until I'm on my way
Girl I'm tryna get to you as fast as I can but until
I get there, can you hold it down girl
Hold it down girl, hold it down girl, hold it
'Til I'm on my way, hold it down girl
