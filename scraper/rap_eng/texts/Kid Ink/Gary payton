[Verse 1]

Sometimes you walk inside my house, crib look like a burg less
Babyfood true I been the man since First steps
All I do is win I go in like birdchucks
Got my mind right but I think I'mma take the First left
And go crazy on you niggas Acksanna So
Raw nigga I could break through your best condom girl
Hit like she catches but my bitch ain't cumming and
I don’t want to check the figure unless they want comment
I’ll be on some other shit , don’t you recognize the smell ho
Bitch I am a beast and I'mma bout to let my tail show
Drain no do’ check my motherfucking cash flow
You can hate me now but they still listening like Castro
Big head nigga snapback on the 3rd hole
Fly as a motherfucker meet me at the terminal
Sickest nigga here, illness is fucking terminal
Money all around so you know who I turn to

[Hook]

You niggas just hating
You use to be ballin
But now you Gary Payton
If you ain't talking money I’ll talk to you later
Cuz My mind is going up meet at the elevator soon
(2x)

Yeah ….. I let it bread…. Yeah(2x) I let it …

[Verse 2]

I said I’m high in space, Astroboy
Now you know we got that loud if you ask for noise
Yeah is fish in the sea and I see a lot of coys
Call me jack sparrow holla at them like ahoy
Bitch wet of this drink, nigga just walk the plank
Of course we blowing swishes till this motherfucker stink
Bay let queue must be in the shoes
If you think I’m balling now? Wait until game 2
I'mma go hard till these bitches call a time-out
I’ll be saying shit it take a week for you to find out
Shit last long, like I had the play the bad food
And if you have a problem motherfucker I can have you

[Hook]

You niggas just hating
You use to be ballin
But now you Gary Payton
If you ain't talking money I’ll talk to you later
Cuz My mind is going up meet at the elevator soon
(2x)

Yeah.... I let it bread... Yeah(2x) I let it..
