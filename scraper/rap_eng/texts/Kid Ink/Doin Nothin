See these deals keep stackin up in my mailbox
Wondering when the hell this is gonna stop
Beautiful night but a stressful day
Wish I had more money, all I wanna do is play
But I gotta work hard just to make a real livin
Take what I can ‘cus there ain’t nobody givin
Hardly gave a smoke but tonight I wanna do so
Call the Hussle, getting really leveled
Smoke to the ceiling, with a feelin got me illin
Stress on my brain, let it go, let’s roll
Life on a cloud when I exhale loud
That done came through when I give you by the pound
Pass that pass that pass that
A’ight, rrready for another round
On another wave when I bump that sound
No worries in my head right now

(Hook)
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling

Life sometimes can be crazy right?
So tonight we have a hazy night
Air is great with my lazy eyes
No more stress, full of good inside
See what you try to pursuit
It’s like game and you ain’t got a 9 to 5 cuz you playin dumb
But you make a little money from yo music when you want
But you’re stress-free, you go and it shows in yo songs
I just wanna take a break, I ain’t doin shit today
Laid back and it’s Friday blowin in my face
Hit that pass that thing to the left
Hit that pass that thing to the left
Rotate, rotate, don’t break it up
High when I wrote this, I ain’t make it up
Bring the hook back, I don’t wanna rap no more
I don’t wanna…

Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling

(Kid Ink)
Said I don’t feel like- give a fuck
What you feel about me?
No, real life
I was up all night, nigga ain’t get high until 3
What? Too high
Blunt big, is it 2 by… 4
Woa! Drop where the wood
Turned over and chop down that ho
Got me back in the bizz, sent her ass to the kitchen
Fresh bacon and eggs, OJ I’mma kill it man
I ain’t going nowhere, put my phone on vibrate
You should hit me tomorrow, I don’t know about today

(Hook)
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Today I don’t feel like doin nothin
Just relaxing with the smoke, hit the ceiling with a feeling
