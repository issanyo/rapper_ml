I’m going hard body till there’s no more room left
And you ain't never seen nobody sit through this
You got space?
Tat it up
Tat it up
Tat it up
Tat it up

First off yeah i’m tatted up and my bitch too
You just got a bunch of different names like a bitch do
You da type of nigga in a book trying to pick through
I be getting blasted motherfuckin click through
Death mood, no pin you can call me big man
Showing skin you ain’t goin ham like an islam
Light to a dark skin, nigga with no tan
No shirt in this bitch hollywood ho gear
Frankenstein tatted on me cause I an a monster
See a lot a pain you can me at the hostel
Face like a aston (…)
All the ideas you’re my motherfuckin lights on
See it from the front or the back like an iphone
I walk inside the room and i’m the one they got their eyes on
Me say you ain’t fucking with my DJ
Catch up you ain’t even started on your sleeves yet
Need to book a couple more sessions trying to reach us
Paint guns stuck into my flesh like leeches
All that shadin’ shows that your just soft
And if you got a problem middle finger fuck off
I’m on some new shit im a face look
I know you wish you thought of this like facebook
And I done told give a fuck how the case looks
Cause niggas try to steal my shit, bill gates crooks
And I can pass for a vato
If you tatted, nigga i’m picasso
I’m the shit, you can get it on your nostrils
You can take a picture or get it on your ipod

I’m going hard body till there’s no more room left
And you ain't never seen nobody sit through this
You got space?
Tat it up
Tat it up
Tat it up
Tat it up
