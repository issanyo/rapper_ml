[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah, woah, hahh, hahh, hahh
Alright

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I'm so heavy in the game
My pockets got a little weight
I'm so heavy with the chain
Feel like my neck about to break
When here come the champagne
I'ma drink fast live a little nigga check your pace
You try'na battle in the club
Play your cards right I know you see them bottle of that Ace
Them bottles go to waste
Just got another 4 liters of chase
I been on hold all day
Them kinda' problems you probably just don't relate
Alright, I just try to keep it regular
But you niggas seem to keep on getting jealous
Alright, don't know what the lesson is
I'm doing me and you can keep on doing lesser than it

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I don't know about the pressure
Got money on the dresser
You've been try'na stay relevant, and
We've been getting to it no pressure

I don't know about the pressure
Got money on the dresser
You've been try'na stay relevant, and
We've been getting to it no pressure

I don't know about the pressure
Got money on the dresser
You've been try'na stay relevant, and
We've been getting to it no pressure

[Verse 2: Bricc Baby Shitro]
I'm screaming fuck the competition
Son of a briccer always had a pot to piss in
Son of a briccer always had a part to whip it
I can show you how to stretch it, how to remix it
You can get a whole thing, yeah 36'n
And if a nigga wanna zip I serve it to him quick
I'm catching plays in the hood yeah I'm politicking
And if a nigga try to rap I turn him to a victim
As-salamu alaykum, let him meat his maker
Hear the fat lady sing, Anita Baker
I mix the purple with the yellow now I'm sipping liquor
Me and money stick together like we blood related
Man, and I don't know about the pressure
I will never see The Great Depression
Batgang balling no recession
While y'all niggas stressing
I'm in the trap counting blessings

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I don't know about the pressure
Got money on the dresser
You've been try'na stay relevant, and
We've been getting to it no pressure
We've been getting to it no pressure
We've been getting to it no pressure
