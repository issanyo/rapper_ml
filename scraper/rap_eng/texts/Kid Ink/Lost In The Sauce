(Jahlil Beats, Holla At Me)

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Man I hear these niggas talk
When I see 'em but they don't really say it all
But we ain't really feelin' y'all
Anyway man I swear that they fuckin' lost
Lost, in the sauce, they fuckin' lost
Lost, in the sauce, they fuckin' lost, lost
And I been tryna play it off
But somebody need to tell them who they really are

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, and tell 'em what I'm really 'bout
From the bottom nobody there to dig me out
All these gold diggin' hoes on a nigga now
Tell her take it the flo', baby sit it down
Uh, way before the rap nigga
I would barely wave to these wack niggas
But now I see 'em all with they hands out
Like a diver, I let 'em all drown
I'm yellin' out
Reportin' live somewhere on the cloud
Worldwide but these niggas know I'm westbound
Everybody takin' shots lemme get a round
Talkin' shit I plunge ya motherfucker
At the top come bungee with a motherfucker
Up all night, fuck who to rest with
And let ya girlfriend know who the best is

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Man I hear these niggas talk
When I see 'em but they don't really say it all
But we ain't really feelin' y'all
Anyway man I swear that they fuckin' lost
Lost, in the sauce, they fuckin' lost
Lost, in the sauce, they fuckin' lost, lost
And I been tryna play it off
But somebody need to tell them who they really are

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
And come try to tell me that it's hype now
Hollywood they ain't ready for my lifestyle
Money talk, I don't care how it might sound
Put yo' ears to the ground hear me comin' down
Like a stampede, live the fast life
Of a celebrity, these niggas ain't won shit
Why they celebratin'?
On a whole 'nother level
On a elevator, got 'em lookin' to the sky
See me high up, finally everything
I desired, is in my hands
See so many niggas lose it, over this bullshit
No aim, shootin' for the stars with a full clip
Now they tryna get they hands in my pot
Lost in the sauce, meatball problems
Swear I, can't take, no more of the nonsense
Tell 'em I'm ready for the consequence, bitch

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Man I hear these niggas talk
When I see 'em but they don't really say it all, all
But we ain't really feelin' y'all
Anyway man I swear that they fuckin' lost, lost
Lost, in the sauce, they fuckin' lost, lost
Lost, in the sauce, they fuckin' lost, lost
And I been tryna play it off
But somebody need to tell them who they really are
Tell em
