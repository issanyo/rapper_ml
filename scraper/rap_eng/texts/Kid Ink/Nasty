[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Diamond Cartier, got a blang on my fist
Lighter in my hand, colored strain in my swish
Niggas be like "damn, boy you get it and you flex"
I just be like "nah, I just get it how I live" (Ah yeah, yeah)
Pull up real fast, on my curb (SKKRT)
0 to 100 when I swang and I swerve
See them niggas hate
But they never say a word
If I play her to the left
Bet I make her wanna flirt (oh yeah, yeah)
You know just how to move that little der, yeah
Slim thick, gon throw it to me like a hail mary
Hell yeah, I love it when you nasty
And staring at that ass whenever you pass me

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Yeeeeeeeeah
I like you when you nasty
Like some of my girls ghetto and classy
Hit you from the back in back of the backseat
Hydraulics how we tippin' the wagon (Aw yeah)
I'm with a freak in the sheets
Big booty, tip drill like the Jam of The Week
She always wanna ride til she fallin' asleep
808 pounding it like I'm makin' a beat (ooooooo)
So I swear I can't control when I hit it
Whip it cake batter in the bowl how I lick it
Like cheerleader on the pole when she split it
If she throw that ass I'ma throw that ass some digits (yeah yeah oh yeah)

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I see you on the sideline, workin' on your game
I could put you in the zone, I could help you make a play
It's something 'bout that champagne get you in a state
LA attitude and Atlanta in the waist, (aww nah nah)
Don't waste nothin' in yo' cup
Class just started and we movin' to the sub
It's a movie, check IMDb for the cast
I talk with my money and you talkin' out your ass
Blah, blah, blah
Said you could tell them other bitches bye-bye
Lemme get you city high, brown eyes, 5'5"
5'7" in them heels, go on get them thangs on
Freak of the week, we all singing the same song

[Hook: Kid Ink & Jeremih]
