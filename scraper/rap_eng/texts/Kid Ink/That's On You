[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho!

[Hook]
Nigga that's on you!
My day just popped
Your night goin' slow
That's on you!
Tryna keep up with a youngin'
Got them pockets on low
Nigga that's on you!
She came here alone
Shouldn’t have let her leave home
That's on you!
It's all on you

[Verse 1]
Nigga, that's all on you
Know the check, nigga all on me
Shawty she in love with the bass
I give it to her all on beat
Let me see you dance in my honor
While I roll up one for insomnia
We gon' be up 'til mañana
Wake up in my club clothes, no pyjamas
Swear that they biting my style like pirhanas
I can't even shop in the mall for designer's
You still tryna figure out who designed them
I'm tryna make LA the home of the Niners, I'm home
Somebody need to get this niggas paid
I swear they be hatin' like a job
Back up, they ain't far enough
Tryna act like it's all of us, but..

[Hook]
Nigga that's on you!
My day just popped
Your night goin' slow
That's on you!
Tryna keep up with a youngin'
Got them pockets on low
Nigga that's on you!
She came here alone
Shouldn't have let her leave home
That's on you!
I paid my dues, don't get it all confused
It's all on you
(It's all on you)

[Verse 2]
I'm all out of champagne
Poppin' like a Uzi
It's 'bout three
Just left out of Hooray's
Nigga just made a blu-ray
Runnin' from the lady outside selling bouquets
OG only flower that I want
You can keep that sour in your blunt sheet
Lookin' for the nose candy, Willy Wonka
Money don't grow, I feel like I found one tree
Tryna roll like I once see
Three point five doing a hundred from zero
My year just flashed forward
You still tryna find exposure

[Hook]
Nigga that's on you!
My day just popped
Your night goin' slow
That's on you!
Tryna keep up with a youngin'
Got them pockets on low
Nigga that's on you!
She came here alone
Shouldn’t have let her leave home
That's on you!
I paid my dues, don't get it all confused
It's all on you

[Bridge]
I don't know where your mind at
I don't waste no time, yeah
You gon' get left behind here
I don't know where your mind at
I don't waste no time, yeah
You gon' get left behind here

[Outro]
Nigga that's on you!
I paid my dues, don't get it all confused
It's all on you
It's all on you, baby
