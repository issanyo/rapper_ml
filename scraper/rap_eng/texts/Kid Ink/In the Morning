[Intro]
Count the money up in the morning
Just a young nigga getting money in the morning
Uh, in the morning

[Hook: Chrishan/Kid Ink]
I wake up, in the morning (in the morning)
Brush them haters off, in the morning
Yeah. In the morning (in the morning)
Yeah. In the morning (in the morning)
(x2)

[Verse 1: Chrishan]
Pour it up, pour another drink
Tell me how it taste, Niggas hate
We know what it is, They know what it ain't
Blowing dank, I might take your bitch
Fuck her on a mink, Oh no wait
I might take yo bitch, feed her to the team
Bottles in the cooler, Models be from Aruba
Got medulla out in Cuba
Niggas think it's a rumor
Til I pull up in the martin
Stuntin' like we do ah, Girls on me
I'm ready to give it to em'
Hit the cool meet em' at the pool
Million dollar views
50 girls back up in the room, Blowing down the flo
Jacked up see me double cupped, Everything in 2′s
Never lose kings never lose, Shawty what it do

(Chorus)

[Verse 2: Chrishan]
Throw it up baby hit the flo
I’ll make the merry go down down
Show me how you want it, Baby row that boat
Pour da mo for all these bitch niggas forever fakin
Now dat I'm famous all these women stay forever naked
Money by the ‘cino, Bitches from Puerto Rico
Shots of the henny wash me down wit that greyho
Just a young nigga with a dream from the ghetto
Now I fuck bad bitches while they scream in the pillow
Hit the cool meet em' at the pool
Million dollar views
50 girls back up in the room, Blowing down the flo
Jacked up see me double cupped, Everything in 2′s
Never lose kings never lose, Shawty what it do

(Chorus)

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I said I wake up in the morning
Something round 2 O' clock
Bout to do it big nigga you could say I do a lot
Boom still loud boutta turn into a monsta
Middle finger up to everybody that mocked us
Now I'm on everybody roster
Higher than rasta
I ain't even conscious
All that cheap talk I don't even pay attention
We don't hold money baby
Let it burn like a incense stem
Close to my dreams
I could feel it in inches
I'm a half skinned and paid
Like I'm living off a pension
Like a episode of maid
Yeah my life is like a TV show
Up in the morning
You can call me a cereal.. killer
