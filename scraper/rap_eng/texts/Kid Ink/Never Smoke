[Hook]
We go, we go, I don't wanna come down
The party just started right now
We go, we go, baby don't get lost
Full tank cause we about to take off
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, I wanna stay

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna leave it
Come here to me, you wanna breathe
Half of all these wannabes
Sitting back, just wondering
If I'm high or is it just the lights
Gotta live every highlight
Is fucking up my life
Hey Miss Forever 21
Party like you're 22
Throw champagne in the air
Said it look like a wishing well
I wish you well and wish you could
Don't like me cause it's too good
Finally made it to the top
From way Mr. Understood yeah
But now they under us, come have a little fun with us
It ain't a lot of room for all your friends
But maybe we can bundle up
Shades on like Ray Charles, ready for take off

[Hook]
We go, we go, I don't wanna come down
The party just started right now
We go, we go, baby don't get lost
Full tank cause we about to take off
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, I wanna stay

[Verse 2]
Up and away
But I don't need a cape
Like James Brown when I come through
But you probably need a drink
I light it up like [?]
Won't be long 'til they hitting it
I'm on yeah, I'm on
Like somebody flick the switch
Now move your body like a CD
Girls running beside me
In my ear, talking 'bout how
She gon' eat me up like a zombie
Watch me get it in
Get her out her Vera Wang
Ain't a fan, check my gang
Is on point like a flame
This Rose, this ain't Neuvo
Pockets on sumo
Juno, oh Juno
Attitude is too below
Addicted to the fast life
Her everything is moving slow
I'm here to say today
Take a look, up and away

[Hook]
We go, we go, I don't wanna come down
The party just started right now
We go, we go, baby don't get lost
Full tank cause we about to take off
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, up and away
We go, we go, we go, I wanna stay
