[Hook: Kid Ink (Devin Cruise)]
Woke up this morning thinking bout the other night
Trying to do it all again, (like every day is the weekend)
Some say it's a problem, I ain't really worried about it
Trying to party over here, (like every day is the weekend)
No, I can't wait, wait, wait, I can't wait
Stay turnin up, (like every day is the weekend)
No, I can't wait, wait, wait, I can't wait
Let's turn it out, (like every day is the weekend)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah, Monday through Sunday
Red carpets and runways, got three girls like The Runaways
I'm taking shots, back I call that gun play
Shades on, no sunrays, goin overtime, never underpaid (oh)
All week, no days off like a nine to five that's bossing up
And you know I paid the cost
Got a sweet tooth for this sweet life, but I ain't trying to floss
I'm just trying to have a good time, now tell me what you on
Little bit of that orange mixed with Patron
I'mma get you faded by the end of this song
Now we could blow it up, know I got that bom
Just keep it on the low, so security don't find out

[Bridge: Devin Cruise]
Aw yeah, weekend
It feels like the weekend
Aw yeah, weekend
Every day's the weekend
Aw yeah, weekend
It feels like the weekend
Aw yeah, weekend, weekend, yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah, summer time and spring time
You can find me intertwined
Twisted, bitch get in line
There's ten's here, but if a nik-ka didn't have a dime
I'd still find ways to turn it up
Better get out your earplugs (now)
It's relevant, we're killing it, no evidence
Straight to the head like Evelyn
No aspirin, my medicine
Is that, loud pack
The bass hit and I bounce back
Don't think that I can drive, tryin to crash where the couch at (uh)
Hold up, what the fuck happened last night
Can't find where my phone is, throwing up shit like west side
All I need is a shower, let a nigga freshen up my odor
And I'll see you in the morning, said the party's never over
