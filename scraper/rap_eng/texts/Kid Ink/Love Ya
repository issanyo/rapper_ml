[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
But love, I love you any kind of way
Just say what's on your mind
There ain't nothing I can do
With the woman like you but love
I love you any kind of way
Just say what's on your mind, poh there ain't

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah she my lil freak, booty call, never call through the week
Damn, on the Saturday to Sunday, cold bitch eat her like the sundae
Straight downtown like a one way, track star watch how I run game
Got that good good, but she's bad as fuck, beat that pussy down, every time she act up
Uh, all these niggas tryna wife her
But I don't love that girl, I just like her
I got a girl at home, that's just like her
Just tryna have a little fun for tonight cause

[Chorus x2]
There ain't nothing I can do
With the woman like you but love
I love you in any kind of way
Just say what's on your mind

[Verse 2]
There's nothing that I wanna do to you, but to do to you, so beautiful
Damn let me treat you better baby, in your birthday suit yeah we celebrating
There's Rosé and Patron, kush blow by the O, after party back at my home yeah
Now they don’t do it like this nowhere, tell from your Kool-Aid smile baby ooh yeah
Ha yeah, you gotta front it baby

Grinning in the air
Beware, I might bite I have no fear, yeah

[Chorus x2]
There ain't nothing I can do
With the woman like you but love
I love you in any kind of way
Just say what's on your mind
