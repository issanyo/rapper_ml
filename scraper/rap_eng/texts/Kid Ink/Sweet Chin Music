[Intro]
Mmm Hmmm
Yeah
Mmm Hmmm
Egh!

[Chorus]
I'm the same as you left me nigga (Mmm Hmmm, Mmm Hmmm)
Gettin' to the money, not a question nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Know you see the Rock like I'm wrestlin' nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Ask me if I'm high, bitch, you know I'm NASA (Mmm Hmmm)
Ask me what's you name, might forget the answer (Mmm Hmmm)
I'll take everything in here except for chances (Mmm Hmmm)

[Verse 1]
Belt up on my shoulder, don't forget who's champion
Young Aries, nigga, always been a LA Ram
Never bandwagon, neighbors mad my pants saggin'
You can't never tell me nothin' when I'm on my line (Woo)
Before 21, these bitches know I been savage
Made it outta hell with this undertaker flow
Now I flip the money up and I do the tombstone
Said I'm never goin' back, put that on my tombstone
Live the dream, tag-team everything two toned
When I pull up, do my reps and then I flex
Tell that bitch that she can suck it, this DX
Jumpin' off the top, I hope you can catch me
I lost my mind and stopped second guessin' (Mmm Hmmm)

[Chorus]
I'm the same as you left me nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Only thing changed is addresses nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Gettin' to the money, not a question nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Know you see the Rock like I'm wrestlin' nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Sweet chin music, hit the blunt, you feel that? (Mmm Hmmm)
Why we never see you niggas, you chameleon (Mmm Hmmm)

[Verse 2]
I be in the building doin' all my taunts
All black, I don't feel like Ricky, more like Jimmy Ross
Yeah, couple of 'em changed soon as they got the news
I can tell what you say about me in your interviews
One day, I'ma run backstage with the chair
You been talkin' 'bout then I light another flare
Way I'm feelin' and I'm lookin' ain't no seein' wrong (No)
Walkin' out to my theme song
Seen the ass, baby girl, and I ain't think long
And then I picked her up for that power bomb

[Chorus]
I'm the same as you left me nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Only thing changed how we dressin' nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Gettin' to the money, not a question nigga (Mmm Hmmm)
Know you see the Rock like I'm wrestlin' nigga (Mmm Hmmm)

[Outro]
I'm the same as you left me nigga
Sweet chin music, hit the blunt, you feel that?
Mmm Hmmm
Mmm Hmmm
Mmm Hmmm
Mmm Hmmm
