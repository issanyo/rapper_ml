[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Okay now we just came to party, started kinda late
Probably one into the morning, just live out the time
It's 'bout to ride down the highway, would hit a club
Find a hottie off of molly, fall in love
Man them niggas be like, we be poppin bottles
But you still be in the line, I ain't even on the list, you can see me on flyer
Reason why I got yo girl on my fly, I swear to God
She be singing in the club like Mariah, man them bitches be like
We can hit the studio, never seen a booth before
I can book a session, man I promise you'll get every note
She be like what a dream, I be like errthang
Running out of time for the game so

Why you stopping the flow?
Drinks lined up like dominoes
Saying one just ain't enough, flow, round two, go and take it down boo
Gon' and bring a friend, thought you was ;bout that life, man them bitches be like
She might see me later on, baby andale, E-I
Fuck we waiting for now?
You know where the door is, say you got class
We can take it where yo dorm is, Uber or a cab baby
Don't think I should drive, getting harder to disguise
If we running out of time, I think you should decide
If you coming for the ride
Tryna make it home before the sun is on the rise, get the vibe, we go

Bitches be like, watcha wanna do?
I could follow through with my crew
Niggas be like, hurry up, just hurry up
On your way get drinks, I got the drugs
Bitches be like roll up, fill this cup up, watch me cut up
Wussup? I already know, man and them niggas be like
Slow up, let me pour up, do you roll up?
Turn up, I throw this dough up and them bitches be like
