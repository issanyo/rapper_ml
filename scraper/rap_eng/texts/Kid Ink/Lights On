[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Clap clap, turn the lights on
1, 2 check, make sure the mic's on
Grass green but I see a bunch of python's
With their eyes locked cause I'm an icon
Uh, just brush 'em off like Colgate
From the mean streets, you could call it road rage
Fast life never moving in a slow pace
No race, full shift, no brakes
See you atheist, no faith
Don't worry cause I'm straighter than a cold face
Go in and get mine like OJ
'Til they take me away it's

[Chorus]
Every single day, I be going in
There's nothing you can say, I just wanna win
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Cause they told me, I would never make it
But now I
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah

[Verse 2]
I was up in class dreaming, stage with the 50 thou
Fans lights beaming, ready for the summer
Did a lot of spring cleaning, a lot of sweat and tears
For this game I was bleeding, now your boy Charlie Sheening, winning
Just the beginning of what's to come
How my words reach the bangers and the hipsters and the punks
Guess it was worth the bullshit that I had to overcome
All started from the days Kriss Kross made me jump
A young'n with a passion for rap
And if you told me that I couldn't I was ready to scrap, look at me now
I guess it's safe to say it's going down
And I know Ill sitting back like "Look what I done found, Alumni"

[Chorus]
Every single day, I be going in
There's nothing you can say, I just wanna win
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Cause they told me, I would never make it
But now I
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah

[Verse 3]
Haters rather see me fall like a rain drop
Dedicated to this so this where the rain stops
Don't believe in me, like the tooth fairy
Looking in the mirror screaming out Bloody Mary
Said we wouldn't make it, Christopher Columbus
Now we in there looking for the Calvin Broadus numbers
Clap clap, turn the lights on
Poker face, Polo Tee and white Nike's on
Backstabbers going in like it's a tattoo
Been dealing with them all my life, so it's nothing new
This is what history looks like in the making
So just watch me and my squad make it

[Chorus]
Every single day, I be going in
There's nothing you can say, I just wanna win
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Cause they told me, I would never make it
But now I
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
Turn the lights on, yeah, turn the lights on, yeah
