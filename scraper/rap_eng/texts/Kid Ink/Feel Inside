[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah, that's just how I feel inside
Inside, she just wanna get inside
Hop up then and get inside
That's just how I feel

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I'm, young and getting it busy nigga always pressed for time
Moving in fast forward you can sit and press rewind
Sipping champagne I don't really mess or whine
I leave that simping to them bitches and them nigga crying
About them bitches nigga I don't really do that either
I paint a picture pimp it easy for you on that easel
Got the gas in the whip but this ain't sour diesel
Every day is Friday I hit you with that Deebo
Blunt as fat as Cee Lo, rolling up on my cd
Then roll up all the windows, smoke till can't nobody see me
I got a quarterback pass that I'm wide receiving
You messing up rotation talking 'bout how soft my seat is
'Trina ass every move I know you slip and slide
Check baby I could get you wetter come and hit the tide
Said I ain't tryna brag, just tryna speak my mind
I don't say it much, that's just how I feel inside

[Hook: Kid Ink]
(Ow!) That’s just how I feel inside
That’s just how I feel inside
(Laid back nigga) That’s just how i sit inside
(Heard the leather soft) She just wanna feel inside
That’s just how I feel inside (feel inside)
That’s just how I feel inside
(Both windows up) That’s just how I sit inside
(Heard the leather soft) She just wanna feel inside
