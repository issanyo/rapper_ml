[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yo what's going on? It's your boy Kid Ink rocking with the flat fiddy right now. Make sure you check out my new joint, ayo, Who Kidd!

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Spend all day tryna' stay humble
I could show it off if I really want to
They be talking all that but who really cares
I ain't scared to let em' know: Hold it in the air
Got that money in the room (Hold it in the air)
If that fire in the room (Hold it in the air)
Got some bottles in the room (Hold it in the air)
I hold it in the air, hold it in the air

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
(Uh, uh uh)
Hot as it can be
You need a tele-scope, if you tryna' see me
I be hella, dope
Something like a picture no one ever need a cut is actually cause I be drinking out the pitcher
Keep it coool
I be tryna' chill but these niggas act a fool so I gotta show and tell
Like a nigga back to school, sittin' on the world
See me spinning round' the room, walking on the moon
Call me rocket-ship, shawty if I do
Her pill just kicked got you biting on your lip
She told me that she want it, I ain't even gotta slip it
I might leave with your chick'n if I catch you niggas slippin' (Ooh!)
Ain't no question yeah
Leave this motherfucker bout' it
I can spend it all, to-night, no cares
Just run up in the bank like Clyde and my bitch bout' it
No lie baby I'm just being honest

[Hook]
