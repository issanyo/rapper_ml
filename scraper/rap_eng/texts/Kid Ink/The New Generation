[Intro]
We are, we are the voice (x3)

[Verse 1]
Somebody gotta rep for us
Young outcast, running from the task force
In the streets, they worry 'bout the tabloid
The statistics say I fit the category
I see 'em looking on me down, why?
They sweatin' me, can I get a towel, it's
Out with the old, in with the new
Ain't goin' nowhere, so you better get used to
It's breakin' the rules in half
It's no free rides tryna take this path
No shortcuts, yeah, they don't make no maps
Waited all my life, gotta make it last

[Bridge]
So I'm just sittin' here smoking on this Bob Marley
Thinkin' 'bout making, history
I don't know my father, should I call Maury?
Can't really speak much for the ones before me

[Hook] (x2)
We are, we are the voice
We are, we are the voice
We are, we are the voice, voice
Of a new generation

[Verse 2]
Uh, they'll probably never understand
Why, but I was made for another plan
Doin' me can't live for another man
Full of mistakes, out looking for another chance
Look in the mirror, take another glance
See you yourself, before you try to judge math
It's me, the last of a dying breed
Big dreams, but I'm trying not to fall asleep
Tell 'em, come and follow me
I feel like it's my responsibility
To say, "fuck them" when you can't do it
It'll be okay, I know you been through it

[Bridge]
Just roll up, pass one
Try to show 'em, how to have fun
It's nothing new under the sun
But I'm still public enemy number one

[Hook]
