[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
So I don't even ask what you want or what you thinkin'
I know what's your favorite, I know what's your favorite
So I just order all ros√© from the waitress
Cause I know that's your favorite, I know that's your favorite
I just fucked around and fell in love with your crazy
And you love the way I hit your body like a taser
Lamborghini dreamin' how she ride, how she taste it
Lamborghini dreamin' take off in my space ship
1-0-0 on the dash feel the matrix
We gone, the vibe, so strong, got you high
We stoned, gettin' hotter than the stove when you ride me
Lamborghini dreamin' I'm in love with your body

[Hook: Verse Simmonds & Kid Ink]
Oh, oh, oh, oh stay the night girl
Cause in the morning I wanna wake up to you
Lamborghini dreamin' I'm in love with your body
Oh, oh, oh, oh stay the night girl
I just wanna be the one that gets closest to you, yeah you
I wanna get closer (closer), closer (closer)
I wanna get closer (closer), closer (closer)
I wanna get closer (closer), closer (closer)
I wanna get closer (closer), closer (closer, closer)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Closer exactly where you supposed to be
Wake up, roll over and roll some
Eat you up for breakfast, good morning mimosas
We back at it again, I put that ass back to sleep
Even when she sleepin' she sweet dreaming 'bout the D
And prolly goin' shoppin', I cop shit that she don't need
Cause bossin' with my bitch the bossest shit I know, capiche?
Sausin' in that salsa, slip 'n slide through the street
Driftin' down rodeo, why they take pictures?
Young Bonnie and Clyde, yeah you know it's just
Me and my foreign shawty lookin' so exotic
Lamborghini dreamin' I'm in love with your body

[Hook: Verse Simmonds & Kid Ink]
Oh, oh, oh, oh stay the night girl
Cause in the morning I wanna wake up to you
Lamborghini dreamin' I'm in love with your body
Oh, oh, oh, oh stay the night girl
I just wanna be the one that gets closest to you
(I wanna be the one that gets) closer to you
(Closer), closer (closer)
Closer to you (closer), closer (closer)
Closer to you (closer), closer (closer)
I wanna get closer to you (closer), closer (closer)
Closer to you (closer), closer (closer, closer)

[Outro: Kid Ink & Verse Simmonds]
Lamborghini dreamin' I'm in love with your body
Lamborghini dreamin' I'm in love with your body
Lamborghini dreamin' I'm in love with your body
Lamborghini dreamin' I'm in love with your body
I wanna get closer (closer), closer (closer)
I wanna get closer (closer), closer (closer)
I wanna get closer (closer), closer (closer)
I wanna get closer (closer), closer (closer, closer)
