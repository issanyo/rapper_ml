[Intro]

[Chorus]
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
Grab my hand if you think you qualify, yah
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
On demand, you know I got the supply, yah

[Post-Chorus]
Okay, let's go
The zip, don't close
The flip you chose
I pick and roll
The whip, you so gross
The girl, with the fo'
Just doubled up my O's
And tripled up my dough

[Bridge]
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah

Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
(Yah, yah, yah yah, yah)

[Verse 1]
Yah, yah, think somebody high, yah
Drop down, dunk on you like Zion, oh
We them young niggas with no guidance
Roll one, face up, tatted like the Mayans
Don't fuck with me 'cause my family feel
Dirty ghetto kids came up of that can of food
Now I cop the bag, party pack, you can't refuse
Tryna keep my shit together, can't stop breakin' rules and makin' moves
I'm in this bitch on my Damien Wayne
That mean more money and major pay
I can't sit and watch you eating, I go get a plate, nah
These niggas did it for themselves, I do it for steak

[Chorus]
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
Grab my hand if you think you qualify, yah
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
On demand, you know I got the supply, yah

[Post-Chorus]
Okay, let's go
The zip, don't close
The flip you chose
I pick and roll
The whip, you so gross
The girl, with the fo'
Just doubled up my O's
And tripled up my dough

[Bridge]
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
(Yah, yah, yah yah, yah)
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
(Yah, yah, yah yah, yah)

[Verse 2]
I'm back again, its what it looks
Might switch up the style, still with the crooks
Got that Dirty Harry on me, need to hit the suds
You so fogi, actin' phony, swear you niggas sus
I finally got the plug, it came out the mud
Don't believe in love, way hoes don't believe in love
Got my stripes, same way that Adidas does
In this Lambo, really feel like I could beat the fuzz
Slip and slide,  it's one a time
You never seen this shit before, it's one a' kind
Do it, Biggie, hypnotizer
I can get into it, shawty, dead on arrival

[Chorus]
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
Grab my hand if you think you qualify, yah
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
On demand, you know I got the supply, yah

[Post-Chorus]
Okay, let's go
The zip, don't close
The flip you chose
I pick and roll
The whip, you so gross
The girl, with the fo'
Just doubled up my O's
And tripled up my dough

[Bridge]
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
(Yah, yah, yah yah, yah)
Yah, yah, yah yah, yah
(Yah, yah, yah yah, yah)

[Outro]
