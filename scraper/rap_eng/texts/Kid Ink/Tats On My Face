That's why you wanna be like me right?
Where you from again?
Ok

[Hook]
Ink on the chest.Got Ink on my hands
Fucking nine to five
I think I'm 'bout to go HAM
And get a tat on my face
I'm gettin' tats on my face
Ok. Got my respect. Bitches think I'm the man
Fucking nine to five
I think I'm bout to go in
And Get a tat on my face
I'm getting tats on my face

[Verse]
Bitch, I tell them, "roll up."
And they be yelling that
And I got that fire, nigga
Had to go from hell and back
I will never loose. Found my groove
Where is Stella at
Yeah they say they love a movie but that shit is just an act
Things change. and everybody looking like they gangbang
But me I know some OG's and call them by their first name
Wassup?! You would probably tell a nigga
Me? I ain't seen or heard nothing. Helen Keller, nigga
Tats on my face. Bats on my face
Cheese up. Now I got rat's on my case
Why even hate? I can see that you jealous
The way you on my head shoulda grabbed an umbrella
Grass greener on my side. You still on that bullshit
That it why your girlfriend on top of me like cool whip
Yeah, fucking nine to five. I don't wake up 'til the noon
Getting tatted on my body. All black like a groom. Tell them!

[Hook]
Ink on the chest.Got Ink on my hands
Fucking nine to five
I think I'm 'bout to go HAM
And get a tat on my face
I'm gettin' tats on my face
Ok. Got my respect. Bitches think I'm the man
Fucking nine to five
I think I'm bout to go in
And Get a tat on my face
I'm getting tats on my face
