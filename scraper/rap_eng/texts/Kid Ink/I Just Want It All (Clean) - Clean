I-I-I just want it all
Money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live the boss life
I-I-just want it all
Pullin' a bad, bad, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
I just want it all all all all all

I just want it all, high above the law
Kill them so cool you can call me Mr. Frost
Come and find me where the money is, ever feeling lost?
I just wanna ball so sick of playin' toss
I remember back then I had a dream since then
I've been sleep walking all-all-all the ups and downs I was see-sawing
Only made me strong like steroids
Game time I just served these niggas like a bell boy
Tell them that it's over (over)
Finito
I can make it bump bump bump like a mosquito
It's just all in my cee-lo
And my pockets are the only thing bigger than my ego

I-I-I just want it all
Money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live a boss life
I-I-just want it all
Pool and a bad bitch, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
I just want it all all all all all
Yeah
I just want it all all all all all

I don't wanna stall, I would never leave means
I don't wanna fall, no matter the cost
I-I-I'm all in till the coffin
Kush coughin' nicer than your conscience
Finally everywhere you wanna be moving high velocity
Driving irresponsibly but I think you should come
And take a ride see the world through my eyes
Every day is a surprise
So I party like my birthday
L.A. is my birthplace
First place, West side loud as a I wanna be
They been sleeping on me, now they are in the fetal
Yeah I'm neato everything's in tuxedo

I-I-I just want it all
Money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live the boss life
I-I-just want it all
Pullin a bad, bad, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
I just want it all all all all all
