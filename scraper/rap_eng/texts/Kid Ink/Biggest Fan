Aye, like, like I traveled all over the world to see you baby like

[Hook: Sean Hayz and Los]
I'm like damn she cold
With an itty bitty mini skirt bad ass heels and a bag
And a bag she knows
She a diva with class got a weave to her ass

Watch how ham she goes
When her song come on she gonna drop it to the floor like
Fuck what all these bitches say

That short ass skirt and them long ass legs

Looking like a resses cup, chocolate and bcbg pumps
Dancing like a freaky slut, that slo motion that poetry
Climb that pole i'll throw a g, she said fuck that los just flow for me
Your voice make a bitch wanna drop it low for free, I said cool dip
She turned around and popped it I said oooh shit, she looked back at it
