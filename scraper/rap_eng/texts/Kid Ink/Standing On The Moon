[Intro]

Oh...
No...
Yeah...
Uh...

[Hook]

You see me standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon, you see me

All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world

[Verse 1]

You see me, I know you see me
Sitting on the moon, ain't nobody in between me
But the stars, it's feeling like I found me a genie
I don't want to let it go, light it up and let it glow
Light it up and let it blow and baby pass that shit
It's a party everywhere and I'mma crash that shit

Yeah, you know when shine bright, higher than stilettos
You gon' need a fucking rocket trying to get up on my level
Come and get up on my level, lil' patron in your system
Weed, chillin' in the back like wisdom teeth
Feeling so close but I'm no where in your reach, look up and I'll be

[Hook]

You see me standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon, you see me

All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world

[Verse 2]

I'm dreaming, yeah, feels like I'm dreaming
How'd we get here so fast, damn we must be speeding
Probably need to slow it down, but I don't think that I will
Going a hundred miles and running baby catch me if you can, yeah

We can live it up all night, two middle fingers up we can fuck all night
Yeah you know if girl got a body like a Coke
It's an after party tell her follow me like a call
I can't get enough I need mo'

Gotta do it for the time, for the times I was broke
Gotta do it for the times, for the times they ain't know
Now all I do shine, put your shades back on

[Hook]

You see me standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon looking down
Standing on the moon, you see me

All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world, world, world
All over the world
