[Intro: Kid Ink]
Oh yeah, Phoebe Ryan
Kid Ink

[Verse 1: Phoebe Ryan (Kid Ink)]
I'm living for the paycheck and the love (Uh huh)
I'm gonna be a legend just because (You know)
I've been working so hard (Go hard) to get respect
Wanna wheel, wanna deal, wanna feel like a president (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan (Kid Ink)]
Oh, oh, you can call me (Call me)
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Someday I'll be (We'll be) money, money

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan (Kid Ink)]
Cause baby I'm just living life
Giving my all, all day and night
Not gonna stop until
They're putting my face on the dollar bill
(Dolla, dolla, dolla, dolla)
Tell you I'm just feeling alive
It's about time, yeah the time is right
Not gonna stop until
They're putting my face on the dollar bill
(Dolla, dolla, dolla, dolla)
Money, money, money, money, money, money
(It's all about the dollar bill)
Money, money, money, money, money, money
(You know)

[Verse 2: Phoebe Ryan]
I don't need anybody (Nah, nah) I got myself
And I've been doing alright (Alright) without your help
I think they need a new face and I'm the one
I'mma rise, I'mma shine, I'mma fire just like the sun

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan (Kid Ink)]
Oh, oh, you can call me (Call me)
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Someday I'll be (We'll be) money, money

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan (Kid Ink)]
Cause baby I'm just living life
Giving my all, all day and night
Not gonna stop until
They're putting my face on the dollar bill
(Dolla, dolla, dolla, dolla)
Tell you I'm just feeling like
It's about time, yeah the time is right
Not gonna stop until
They're putting my face on the dollar bill
(Dolla, dolla, dolla, dolla)
Money, money, money, money, money, money

Money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money

Money, money, money, money, money, money

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I got money on my mind, mind, mind on my money
Tryna see my I.D, here's a hundred
I ain't change but these chains to my stomach
I'm just tryna ball hard like it's any given Sunday, yeah
Drop, T-Top when's it's sunny, doing ninety to a hundred
Feel the wind through your ponytail
Shopping in the summer, tryna fit the fall
Can't ship it next day, then we hit the mall
Ain't no reason tryna save my inches
Got paid and I spent it

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan (Kid Ink)]
Cause baby I'm just living life
Giving my all, all day and night
Not gonna stop until (Nah, nah)
They're putting my face on the dollar bill
(Dolla, dolla, dolla, dolla)
Tell you I'm just feeling like
It's about time, yeah the time is right (Yeah)
Not gonna stop until
They're putting my face on the dollar bill
(Dolla, dolla, dolla, dolla)
Money, money, money, money, money, money
(It's all about the dollar bill)
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
You know that, you know that, ah...
Money, money, money, money, money, money
(It's all about the dollar bill)
