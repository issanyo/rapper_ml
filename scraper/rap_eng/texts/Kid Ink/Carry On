[Intro]
Ughh, Ugh
Yeah I see you on that new shit, yeah

[Hook]
I tell her, don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Drop it down and take it to the moon
Don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Keep doing what you doing
I can see you on now
You on that new shit
I see you on that new shit
I see you on that new shit
Just keep it true
And I’ll never confuse it

[Verse 1]
‘Cause ain’t nobody fly like you
Like what I see, got a birds eye view
You’re what I’ve been waiting for
2×2, got me all wrapped up like Erykah Badu,so
Drama free, got no luggage, go on carry on
Smile shine bright like a canary stone
Heels on, walking through this lobby like a runaway
Then I’m on to your game, can I come play
Just rolled up, going for the high score
Full attention girl you something that I can’t ignore
Live a life that these other lames can’t afford
There’s a target on your ass, and I'm aiming for it

[Hook]
I tell her, don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Drop it down and take it to the moon
Don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Keep doing what you doing
I can see you on now
You on that new shit
I see you on that new shit
I see you on that new shit
Just keep it true
And I’ll never confuse it

[Verse 2]
It’s more than the physical
Everything you do is so original
Make all these other bitches look invisible
Dressed up, every night is your fashion show
Got tens all around from the panel
Swear that you jump right out of the style channel
Can’t nobody in here see you like
Camo will never show it all off
Just a sample. Came through
Heels Giuseppe, carry on Louie
Go ahead show 'em how to ball, Paul Mooney
Team bougie, you ain’t gotta hide
First class fly, Welcome to the club Mile High

[Hook]
I tell her, don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Drop it down and take it to the moon
Don’t stop, keep it going
So fly, no luggage, baby carry on
Carry on, go on carry on
Keep doing what you doing
I can see you on now
You on that new shit
I see you on that new shit
I see you on that new shit
Just keep it true
And I’ll never confuse it

[Outro]
I, I, I never
I, I, I said I never confuse it, yeah
I, I, I see you
I, I, I see you on that new shit
And don't you get too Hollywood
Remember girl, that [?]
Just kidding
