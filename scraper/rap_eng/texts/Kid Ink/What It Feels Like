[Intro]
Yeah, I can tell you what it, yeah yeah
Uh I can tell you what it feels like
Up all night, waiting for a deal like
Nigga, this is real life, real light
I ain't have a meal night

[Hook]
I can tell you what it feels like, uh
I can tell you what it feels like, tell 'em
Better know this shit is real life
I can tell you what it feels like

[Verse 1]
Uh, in the back of the 'Lac, AC/DC Back In Black
Just ABC's, don't worry bout that
I ain't worried bout nothin'
Been on the road 6 summers, now I'm back on the o'block stuntin'
Ain't shit changed and it's home, mothafucka
Bet a hunnid that my old bitch still love me, leave me alone
You know I couldn't be here alone
I got the team here to even it off
Doin' whatever we feel like, feel like you ain't even involved
Man, this shit is too real life

[Hook]
I can tell you what it
I can tell you what it feels like
Better know this shit is real life
I can tell you what it's...

[Verse 2]
Like when niggas with nothin' they always wanna say something
Pay 'em no attention, that's what made me on top
Bitch, I'm in beast mode, make me a collar
Everybody caught up comin' from the lobby
But you know a nigga still broad and got talent
Sleeping on me put the 5 foot in yo pajamas
I'm just tryna eat, feelin' so piranha, leave me alone
What would you really do if you be doin' me?
Say I sold out, just mad you can't afford me
I'm comin' at your face, kinda hard can't ignore me
Full speed, hit the gas and we roaring

[Outro]
Yeah, I can tell you what it
