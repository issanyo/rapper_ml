[Intro]
Oh yeah
Bankroll got it
Oh, [??]

[Verse 1]
Ah, picture me rollin'
Walk in the room and just sniff the cologne
Lookin' the sky, see me picking a pose
Think I'm so high I need mission control
Niggas so cold I had to lay on my clothes
Diamond are dancing away with the stroke
Bird watching, I stay away from the crows
[??] popping, just wait 'till it close
We gon' keep goin' and goin' again
Know you came here just to roll with your friends
Came in the game and was playin' your role
Now you actin' like you got some plans on your own
Shootin' and picking and reachin'
Your shit is more that just kicking and speakin'
You had that night of your life so we're even
I might disappear and I say when I'm leaving (yeah)

[Hook]
Tried to keep it light (light)
But I might just be on fire
Whatever I say tonight
Please do not remind me (oh yeah)
Wow, just passed the light (light)
I'm tryna hit the fire, say whatever I do tonight (oh yeah)
Please do not remind me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Niggas, my posse drop in this bitch like it's Mission Impossible
Got her ridin' like pimpin', tell 'em no limits,these bitches is optional
I hurt a haters feelin' so bad, might send 'em to the hospital
Know they see, hear I'm eatin', the way that I'm movin', I need my shit hot to go (woo)
Pop and zip, shut this bitch down and I hop and skip
Gave her a wave and she hop and [??]
For you she's playin' so hard to get
For me, that's the way, the players just play
Give me some room while I'm paving the way
[??] in here high, no space in my J's
Standin' too close'll get you smoke in your face

[Hook]
Tried to keep it light (light)
But I might just be on fire
Whatever I say tonight
Please do not remind me (oh yeah)
Wow, just passed the light (light)
I'm tryna hit the fire, say whatever I do tonight (oh yeah)
Please do not remind me, yeah
