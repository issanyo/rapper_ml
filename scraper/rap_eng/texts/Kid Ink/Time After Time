[Hook - K-young]
When you call
I will answer
In the midnight hours
If you fall I will catch you
I’ll be waiting, Time after time
The love that we making is so amazing
Time after time
I save all my kisses for you
I will be waiting
Time after time

[Verse 1 - Kid Ink]
Yeah you’re the woman that I write to
I know a lot done changed since high school
Still haven’t met nobody like you
Finally seeing black & white like Michael
Maybe the time wasn’t right then
But times has change and we can try again
This feeling that I’m feeling so timeless
Girl no matter what time it is

[Hook: K-young]
When you call
I will answer
In the midnight hours
If you fall I will catch you
I’ll be waiting, Time after time
The love that we making is so amazing
Time after time
I save all my kisses for you
I will be waiting
Time after time

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Call me whenever girl
I been trying to get it like a metaphor
Get it?
I think you ready for
Get your feet wet
I can make it rain storm
I know we been around the block
Like a ice cream truck
Damn it's been so long
Where did all the time go?
I think we need some time though

[Hook: K-young]

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
You remember the first time
I made it feel like the first time?
And now we back at it
Scream, I’mma take a stab at it
Kill it til the morning
I said hit it til the morning - get it?
Whenever you're lonely
You know where the phone is
