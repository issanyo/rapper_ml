[Chorus]
I just want it all, money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live a boss life
I just want it all, pullin' a bad bitch, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
Now I just want it all, all, all, all, all, all, yeah
I just want it all, all, all, all, all, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I just want it all, high above the law
Kill 'em so cool you can call me Mr. Frost
Come and find me where the money is, ever feeling lost?
I just wanna ball, so sick of playing toss
I remember back then I had a dream since then
I've been sleep walking all-all-all the ups and downs I was sea-sawing
Only made me strong like steroids
Game time I just served these niggas like a bell boy
Tell them that it's over , finito
I can make it bump bump bump like a mosquito
It's just all in my estilo
And my pockets are the only thing bigger than my ego

[Chorus]
I just want it all, money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live a boss life
I just want it all, pullin' a bad bitch, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
Now I just want it all, all, all, all, all, all, yeah
I just want it all, all, all, all, all, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna stall, I would never leave means
I don't wanna fall, no matter the cost (tell 'em)
I'm all in till the coffin
Kush coughin nicer than your conscience
Finally everywhere you wanna be moving high velocity
Driving irresponsibly but I think you should come
And take a ride see the world through my eyes
Every day is a surprise
So I party like my birthday, LA is my birthplace
First place, west side, loud as a I wanna be
There's sleeping on me, now they are in the fetal
Yeah I'm neato everything's in tuxedo

[Chorus]
I just want it all, money and the cars right
I don't wear a tie but they say I live a boss life
I just want it all, pullin' a bad bitch, way back then
Thought that we would never have this
Now I just want it all, all, all, all, all, all, yeah
I just want it all, all, all, all, all, yeah yeah

[Outro]
You ain't got to give it to me, I'll take it from y'all
