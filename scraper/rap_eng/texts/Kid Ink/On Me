[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah
My left, all on my right
Drunk girls on my left
Drunk girls on my right

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It go, one for the money
And two for the show
Its a party to three
All night for the hoes
I got bottles all on my left, bottles all on my right
Drunk girls on my left, drunk girls on my right
Okay, everything on me
Long as you drinkin'
I said as long as you drinkin'
Everything on me, long as you drinkin'
I said as long as you drinkin'

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Everything on me, feel like I'm liftin'
Fresh to the T, I ain't talkin' bout Lipton
Freak to my left, I could tell by her lip ring
She be wildin'
Believe it or not nigga like Ripley
Groupies all on my right
I be runnin' away like Ricky (Ricky)
Can't say I'm high yet
But damn a nigga real tipsy
Yeah everything drippin'
Club hot at the kitchen
Fake dykes kissin'
Man it feel like Christmas
Uh, tell her open up
Blunt sticky like okra
I don't know what your focus is
We gettin' money, Oprah
Ball hard when I feel like it
Ion care what your heel height is
You the same girl
And I already know how this thang go

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It go, one for the money
And two for the show
Its a party to three
All night for the hoes
I got bottles all on my left, bottles all on my right
Drunk girls on my left, drunk girls on my right
Okay, everything on me
Long as you drinkin'
I said as long as you drinkin'
Everything on me, long as you drinkin'
I said as long as you drinkin'

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
See you with your friends
Tryna take a picture
'Fore it get too late, needa post up on Insta
Gram goin' ham, got two grams in the swisher
Bottle from the top with these soup] coolers no sippers
Said as long as you drinkin'
Everything on me
Feels like a sign, I got everything in threes
Three bottles, three of us, three o'clock, three blunts
Three ways, throw threes up, its Batgang til Jesus
Ease up, this ain't your season
I been in beast mode, wildin' for no reason
Swear that you GrubHub
Nigga I'll show you eatin'
All of these zeros, I promise we ain't leavin'

[Hook: Kid Ink]
It go, one for the money
And two for the show
Its a party to three
All night for the hoes
Bottle one on the house
Bottle two on the low
Its a party to three
Tell me what you for

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Is you down, is you down
To get down wit it
Is you down, is you down
To get down wit it

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I got bottles all on my left, bottles all on my right
Drunk girls on my left, drunk girls on my right
Okay, everything on me
Long as you drinkin'
I said as long as you drinkin'
Everything on me, long as you drinkin'
I said as long as you drinkin'

[Outro: Kid Ink]
You know its

You know its Batgang
