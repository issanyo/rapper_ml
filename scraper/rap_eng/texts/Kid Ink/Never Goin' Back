[Hook]
I'm riding on this money train, to heaven
Pray to God that it last, forever
Cause I'm never going back, never going, never going back x2

[Verse 1]
Never going back, I ain't never going back
Got the city right behind me, same one that's on the hat
Had a chance, now it's my check all over the map
Got the game on locked, key right under the mat!
Feel like I could pick the world and drop it right over your head
I'm a monster, like the people under the stairs
Staring over here? I see you trying to copy like a pen
Bad, bad bitches with me, never take them to my bed
Hope I make it to the morning, Lord forgive me for my sins!
Know I'm probably gon forget, ain't no telling what we did
Up late all night, hotel's where I live at
In love with the road but I ain't got no kids yet
Everybody stay strapped up, might act up
In the club, my cap on, bossed up like Capone
Chip's up, my dip in whatever's in that cap's off
Pull up in the fast lane, come see if you can hop on, baby, let's go!

[Hook]
I'm riding on this money train, to heaven
Pray to God that it last, forever
Cause I'm never going back, never going, never going back
I said we've made it way too far, together
Pray to God that it last, forever
Cause I'm never going back, never going, never going back


[Verse 2]
It's been a long time coming, now it's everybody watching
Walking with my head high, off this kush and all this confidence
Til the day that I die, in the coffin, take caution
It's a price on your head, I don't care just what it cost me
I ain't ever going back, coming for your fucking spine
From right up under your feet, gon kick some motherfucking rocks
Rockstar, slash, rasta, off a couple toxins
Back against the wall, trying to straighten up my posture
Lost in the sauce, all you need now is some pasta
Partner, all up in your face like a popper
Problem child, blame it on Mother Nature
Been around the world, still hated by my neighbors
But that's naysay, they ain't safe from this pay day
It's fuck you, gon pay me, money help take that pain away
Now, no play play, no kiddy kidding in this house party
Speeding down my own lane, y'all never gonna catch up, sorry

[Hook]
I'm riding on this money train, to heaven
Pray to God that it last, forever
Cause I'm never going back, never going, never going back
Said we've made it way too far, together
Pray to God that it last, forever
Cause I'm never going back, never going, never going back
