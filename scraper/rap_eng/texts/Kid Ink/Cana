Head down to my shoe, drippin like the juice
See I'm living proof I got the juice I got the juice

Head down to my shoe, drippin like the juice

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Pour me up a four four

You tannin in that bikin-ah
Tappin on that Ass While I'm tappin this tequila
Knackin' actin Sister Sister with yo friend you must be Tia
Everytime I pull out what I smoke look like Irie doe
And everytime we party like my nigga just got free tho
We might not see the same world look different thru my Dita's
These hoes is all the same so I act different when I meet em
Switchin it up
Suicide watch, wrist with the cuts
Watch how I bust

Sprayin the Dom, Bat is the gang and you know that we up to the sun
King of the city out in LA and I feel like LeBron

Head down to my shoe, drippin like the juice
See I'm living proof I got the juice I got the juice

When I pull up they can't touch me I go hammer
Head down to my shoe, drippin like the juice
See I'm living proof I got the juice I got the juice
