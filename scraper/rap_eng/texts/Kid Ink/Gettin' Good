[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, hope you get it good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, hope you get it good

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I hope you see my clear
If it's a bunch of hoes, you probably see me near
Got everybody here and I'm feeling good
'Bout to pop another bottle, yeah we getting good
Let me get you right
It's Friday and I'm about to get you high
Get you good, smoking in the club
And you could tell the promoter we don't give a fuck
Everywhere I go, I get a lot of love
Everybody know my name, get a lot of pub'
Shades on, getting Hollywood
Get your cameras out, I hope you get it good

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, hope you get it good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, hope you get it good

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I hope you get it, got a table to see that
We ain't in a rush baby, I ain't Russell Simmons
But I'ma need a lawyer, tell me where is cousin Vinny
Cause I'ma set this club up like it's a parking ticket bitches
All around, got me going in circles
It's going down, underneath the surface
Tattoos, I'm in this bitch shirtless
You can hit it 'til you feel it in your sternum
Fresh to death, somebody tell me where the hearse it
I be in the club getting wetter than an urchin
Louisville swishers, I think I'm Barry Bond
Said it's no steroids but my drink is very strong

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, hope you get it good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, hope you get it good

[Verse 3: Ya Boy]
My bitch from LA, my car from the future
I do it precious, Kelly Price, Rasputia
Them hoes know my name, 24 inches sitting on a Range
Tell the waitress more champagne, 'bout to get good, 'bout do my thing
My hoe's the bomb, draped in all new Louis Vuitton
Cheering for a nigga like they wearing skirts and pompoms
It's the rocker man, waitress more vodka, damn
I see you watching fam, hope I ain't got the soccer man
Cause I came to party, aw shit, your bitch just saw me
See I ain't Drake bitch, I meet you in the lobby
Then we can hit the room, baby off a 'shroom
Your girl like a movie cause she coming soon

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, hope you get it good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, yeah we getting good
Getting good, getting good, hope you get it good
