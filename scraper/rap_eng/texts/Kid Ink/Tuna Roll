[Intro]
Yeah. turn me up

[Chorus]
Uh, business as usual
Money on my mind, I can feel it in my cuticle
Fuck the 9 to 5, wasn't made for a cubicle
Now know I'm raw, tuna roll
Yep

[Verse 1]
Uh you know what it is, Kid Ink up in this bitch
Hear that errr smell the scent, bitch I'm on, all in
One hit'll leave a nigga's nose twitching like Bewitched
So what I'm smoking on, I swear to God I'm floating in a drift
Alumni we the illest, sicker than Contagion
All up in your hood like my niggas work at Kragen
Know that L.A. is the city but it look like we from Beijing
Say I don't be in my city? Who the fuck is you fugazing, let's go

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It go Peter picked them peppers, nigga, I just picked them hoes out
Swimming in the money, how I'm living, boathouse
I don't need a floaty cause I'm sitting on a cloud
Tell the world kiss my ass head up, look at me now bitch
Back on immense, stack on stack I'm racking it in
Swear that they ain't fucking with me, talking all that abstinence
Yeah, bitch I'm blowing up, you the bomb
Niggas know I'm raw, tuna roll

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Batter up, I'm outta here
Find me in the cut like aloe vera
I'm the man in this bitch you just Tyler Perry
See me throwing money in the sky 'til I'm outta air
Sorry your honour but I had to kill 'em
Niggas think they hard but they softer than pillows
And I'm high off a pill in the building like dealers
Pissing off the tenants give a fuck 'bout your feelings, tell 'em

I'm on, yeah

[Verse 4: Kid Ink]
Okay, snapback, hatback, smoking on that loud pack
Blow it to the ceiling, look like bombs over Baghdad
Bitch I'm worth a milli, even more before the taxes
I'm the realest on the atlas you can go and ask the masses, what up? What's up
What's up? Uh, roll up, hold up, have a taste
You ain't gotta go to outer space
To see the stars baby, welcome to the show
Yeah these niggas know I'm raw, tuna roll, yeah

[Outro]
Alumini bitch
Wheels up
Niggas know I'm raw, tuna roll
