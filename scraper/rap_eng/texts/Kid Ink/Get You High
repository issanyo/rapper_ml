[Hook:]

Let me get you high for the moment
Come and let me get you high for the moment
What I'm smoking, I'm up
Let me get you high for the moment
Come and let me get you high for the moment
Roll up Girl
We on a cloud, we on a cloud
On a cloud, you ain't never been this high up
We on a cloud, we on a cloud
Oh, yeah, I know you feel it, got your eyes shut

[Verse 1: Devin Cruise]

Lil nigga from west orange, Moved out to the West Side
Ink put me on that medical, that left coast, that best high
My weed blue, my girl yellow, we call that best buy
My chain & that Tron, the two main reasons why her legs wide

Cuff yo diva, this the reason she gon' leave ya
Im a fuckin' animal, don’t you leave it up to beaver
Plus a fuckin' canibal, she go crazy when I eat her
See that bread goin round & round, Pita

This OG that we rolled, it got me Jackie Chan
No, the girl I came with look like she know Jackie Chan
Stuntin, so she kick it with me, bitch im Jackie Chan
Got Her open like the doors on the family van

Im bout that Alumni, just like a straight A student
The cake gettin stupid, everyday a pay day to us
You ain’t talkin' money? It sound like jamaican music
Im rollin up blue dream, Ima make your girl friend do it

Verse 2: Kid Ink
But soon as they open, its gon be a movie
Baby, I'm a keep it rolling
Police smoke got em saying Holey Moley
Go and get a can of Raid, ash tray full of roaches
I started with a quarter, moved to a half
Now an oz, the only think I ever grab
But the OG make yours look like grass
Got a couple long jars, not an old school bag
Whole car, hot box looking out for the cops
Windows up with the AC to the top
Better take it easy, might just cough your lungs out
Put a lil hash in it, bout to have some fun now

Let me get you high for the moment
I ain't got to show it, you can smell that is potent
Come and get this blunt from me, don't wait til it's 420
Sitting on a cloud, just don't look down
