[Intro]
You dig what the fuck we saying
Reese (I swear to God I'm stuck on this million but I don't [?])
Aye Durk, Ink, OTF, Batgang
Let's get it

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I'm getting money, I'm fucking hoes, turnt out right now
These niggas be mad at me, I'ma flex right now
Ride up on me, got a Glock 40, got it up up right now
These niggas ain't worried about it, ain't worried right now
Ring, ring, ring ring
Check out my bling, bling, bling, bling
I do my thing, thing, thing, thing
I'm pouring lean, lean, lean, lean

[Verse 1: Bricc Baby Shitro]
I'm double cupped, off MUD, Molly got me geeked up
Percs, Xans and lean boy, I'm on six different drugs
Call me Shitty Montana, AKA the plug
Nigga try to rob me, he fucked around and catch them slugs
It goes ding, ding, ding, ding, chest, head and spleen
40 with the blue beam have 'em leaning like a dope fiend
VVS my bezel, man my chain and wrists on bling
I'm getting money like fuck a bitch
Got diagnosed with gangrene

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Right now, think I might be on bullshit
Right now, pull up in that all white cool whip
Right now, right now I'm smoking on that piao, piao
I'll never hit a drought, pocket full of money I don't ever wanna count
Ring, Ring, Ring, that's your girl sayin' she lost
I send that ping, ping, ping, then turn that Android right off
I gotta take care of my team 'cause it get lonely at the top
I know that you see everything that we on
Ain't shit cropped out

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I'm getting money, I'm fucking hoes, turnt out right now
These niggas be mad at me, I'ma flex right now
Ride up on me, got a Glock 40, got it up up right now
These niggas ain't worried about it, ain't worried right now
Ring, ring, ring ring
Check out my bling, bling, bling, bling
I do my thing, thing, thing, thing
I'm pouring lean, lean, lean, lean

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
My lil' niggas they ready to kill
They shooting for names, we shooting for real
Killing for deals, but I been inside take an L on that
Breitling, I can't lie, sippin' the lean
OTF the dream team, you ain't gang gang
Chain hang snatch what bengal, Day Date
Blood bath for my city nigga I'ma king
Money, power, respect, in my city I'm part of that
Like Peyton Manning, that trap
I'm bringing all quarters back
Now water whip, F the law like a Forgi grill
40 sit, knocking out his grill
Need a hundred mill and I'll never squeal
Bitch I'm gang

[Verse 4: Lil Reese]
You can't even claim what we claim
Got a lotta niggas like to gang bang
OTF, 300 different gangs
OTF, 300 same gang
Get your chain snatched if your chain hang
The most dangerous block is my gang
And I can't forget the old gang, OBlock
And I can't forget where I came
And I can't forget what I saw
But I'll never tell what I saw
Had to run out for that saw
That's why always screaming fuck the law
Still riding around getting it off
Glock 40 on me go off
If he a stain take em off, need that

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I'm getting money, I'm fucking hoes, turnt out right now
These niggas be mad at me, I'ma flex right now
Ride up on me, got a Glock 40, got it up up right now
These niggas ain't worried about it, ain't worried right now
Ring, ring, ring ring
Check out my bling, bling, bling, bling
I do my thing, thing, thing, thing
I'm pouring lean, lean, lean, lean
