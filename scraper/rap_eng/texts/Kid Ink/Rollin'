[Verse 1]
I'm like, picture me rollin, taking you home
All eyes on me, drink, taking a toast
Said, everybody with me, or the side of the road?
It's me against the world, but I'm never alone
In the streets, I be never at home
Homie, don't you get that wrong
Ho please don't touch my phone
When the thirst is real, start pouring patron
Somebody get a bottle in here
Celebrating like we just hit the lottery (Man!)
Put that on everything, by the top of the year
I be on top of my game, and probably on top of your bitch
Tell em'

[Hook]
Look at me rollin' no hands
You know what the time is
You know what the time is
Go ahead and picture the Roley on my hand
You know what the time is
You know what the time is
Go ahead and picture me rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Go-go-go ahead and, picture me rollin
Picture me rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollllinggg
Picture me rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Go-go-go ahead and, picture me rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Verse 2]
I be back in the mode, not giving a fuck
Charge me with assault, im hittin' the blunt
Never droppin' a dime, just pickin' em' up
You ain't gotta go home, just get in the trunk (rolllinnggg)
I just might get you in trouble
Whole team in here, no need for the huddle
Hut one, hut two, man I just touched down
In a city, met you but you ever come around my way
Holla at your boy for the loud
I'm pound for pound, put it on for the town
What you on for the night?
I ain't one for the height
Y'ain't Killin' these  niggas, gon' follow the light

[Hook]
Look at me rollin' no hands
You know what the time is
You know what the time is
Go ahead and picture the Roley on my hand
You know what the time is
You know what the time is
Go ahead and picture me rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Go-go-go ahead and, picture me rollin
Picture me rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollllinggg
Picture me rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Go-go-go ahead and, picture me rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Verse 3]
I.. I.. I said you betta get ya Kodak
Trying to get everybody high off of contact
Fresh motherfucker, clothes ain't hit the floor yet
I don't even wanna leave my jacket in the coat check
Hands round a bad bitch, waist like a corset
Shorty wanna ride, she my little red corvette
Picture me rollin', paintin' the sky red
Lost my mind, where the time went, wildin'

[Outro]
Picture me rollin'
Rollin'
Rollin'
Go-go-go ahead and, picture me rollin
Picture me rollin'
Rollin' (I said)
Rollin' (I said)
Rollinnnnggg
Go
Eghh
Go-go-go ahead and
Tell 'em
Woop, woop, woop
Go
