Can you feel it?
You can turn me up
Can you feel it?
You can turn me up
So you can feel it
You can turn me up
I got a bottle on me
Shots on three, Can you feel it?

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I could feel it on the way, never fray
In the building like, this is where I stay
My estate, put your drink in the air if you relate
Plenty fish in the sea, we throwing money like bait, uhh
Now let me see you shake your body off tempo
Your body so cold and I can see all of the symptoms
If you come into my section, you ain't even gotta mention
It's about a couple bitches, bag of Swishas on my niggas and we
Getting it, you should come and feel this
Live the sweet life, need a filling
Take a hit then inhale and release
Gotta pocket full of trees, baby we ain't gotta leave till you feel it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: LoS] Let's go baby
I told her honey how you feel?
If I could I would marry you, But for now I just bury you
In 20 dollar bills, uhhhh
My watch be winking at you, my link be blowing kisses
Yea bitch I’m blowing money, like Ink be blowing swishes
I’m swinging low on dishes, them guts all yellow
My paint sky blue, you could say my car mellow
I get your girl to get ghost bored, I go hard
If I post up on this, she’ll be sending you post cards
She love how fucking a celebrity feel
I Roberto Cavali her body, Giseppi the heel
I’m definitely chill, we drop top in them Beverly Hills
And we be rolling rolling blowing strong
Going going going, gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Milli Millz]
Uh uh, Ho you don’t feel it when I guess you parapelegic
Start sunning niggas, I think I’m playing with Phoenix
And I’m balling with my shot like I’m Gilbert Arenas
And I’m breaking birdies down, Serena and Venus
Go turn it up, set a nigga steady burn it up
Clothes stay hotter than furnace, they waiting on me like hurry up
Yea, I’m on the web like Charlotte
Don’t panic, don’t clutch, Glen Rice with the Hornets
She’s like real city nigga, I need me a Bugatti
Talking bout the game, in a pocket like polly
And all my niggas that he ride with, chrome
Put that metal to your side like an iphone 4
And that’s when you
