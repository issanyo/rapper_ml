[Intro: Kid Ink]
Ehh, watch 'em (x2)
Ehh, gotta watch 'em (x2)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, I ain't never liked them niggas no way
Pair of Jordans kicking down your door ay
Every and any time the dough late
Anytime nigga, anytime
You can save the bullshit for the toilet
No rookie I get it for the pro rate
Got a new crib ready to relocate
Cause everybody think that it's a party
All the time

[Verse 2: Hardhead]
It's all fam fuck friends nigga
For dead presidents dressing up like Lorenz nigga
For the squad do whatever till the end
Cause I got my boys' back and I ain't talking about revenge nigga
Got 'em pissed off like a soft fog
Give me a shot and I'ma take it Harvey Oswald
Any time nigga that's anytime
Don't give two F's bitch no Fendi sign
You washed up just a lost cause
Same city team switching nigga you just Matt Bonds
But my party and my bullshit all the time
New money but old school a bitch then a party line
I need to be rich here forever
Tryna see band after band they talking 'bout Coachella
It's 4 B's bitch been a minute
Bat-tatt gang and all we do is big business

[Verse 3: Bricc Baby Shitro]
Yeah, ok, Batgang General
Bricc Baby we with this shit
Everybody know it's 4 B's but I'm banging Crip
Just copped that 'Rari then put it at the dealership
200 on the dash that's way out your element
Stacking dead presidents I be trapping with them bricks
Chopping up them hoes and yeah nigga that's 36
Pull up with them dirty sticks chopper like Osama bitch
I'ma kill your mama and your homie 1 dollar bitch
All I know is piling bricks
All I know is thousand bricks
All I know is trapping just
Get that work and make it flip
I be on my grind yeah I be on my grind bitch
Getting to that money in the kitchen going ape shit
I'm going ape shit (x3)
