[Intro]
I got 1.5 for the blunt
Go ahead and pass me a Swisher
Blunted, blunted, blunted, where the blunt at?

[Verse 1]
I got 1.5 for the red eye flight
If you tryna get high bitch just my type
Sitting in the room full of disco lights
Pair of shades on, who the coolest nigga on site
Tell 'em hide that, where the fuck you buy that?
I can't even try that, glad I got my own shit with me
Catch up, if it's OG match up
But you ain't got a Swisher then we ain't gon' session
This motherfucking weed so sticky
Breaking this down get ya fingers so messy
You gon' put a hole in the blunt, keep rushing
Shoulda used a grinder ho, them buds chunky now
You could say I'm an addict
Got a gram of the wax if you need a dab hit
Must keep it in a jar cause these niggas cabbage
What you smoke, 420 is my fucking average, imagine
Blunted, blunted, know you can smell me coming
Said blunted, blunted, everybody always like "Sell me something"
But this sack cost more than a 20
You can roll one of mine just wrap it like a mummy
Straight top shelf in the store
Stole the connect, now I get it for the low
So you know I got..

[Hook]
1.5 for the blunt
Go ahead and pass me a Swisher
Smoke about a pound in a month
I don't even pay it no attention
Got 1.5 for the blunt
Go ahead and pass me a Swisher
Stay blunted, blunted, blunted
Where the blunt at?
Blunted, blunted, where the blunt at?
Blunted, blunted, where the blunt at?
I got 1.5 for the blunt
Go ahead and pass me a Swisher, stay

[Verse 2]
Roll one for the niggas who fronted
For the bitches who want it, roll one for the money
Roll one to the face, that's 4 if you counting
High as a mountain, all for these ounces
Uh stuck in the middle of the couch with cotton mouth
I need a sip from the Fanta
So gone think I left a couple nugs at ya crib
Make sure you hit a nigga when you found 'em
Blunted, blunted, me and my niggas treat weed like money
Said blunted, blunted, if I smell another seed I'm running
Said, no sticks, taking shots while you hitting bricks
Know I got the juice and you niggas nowhere in the mix
Be consistent, what you smoke hit or miss
I roll up OG every intermish
O-OG, might make a motherfucker OD
Hit ya body like morphine, army
Babysitting the blunt, I'll get you a car seat
Fuck what it cost me, these dividends is all going to the medicine
It ain't one of the 7 sins, rolling with these 7 grams
Sorry baby if there's weed hanging out the end, but it's

[Hook]
1.5 for the blunt
Go ahead and pass me a Swisher
Smoke about a pound in a month
I don't even pay it no attention
Got 1.5 for the blunt
Go ahead and pass me a Swisher
Stay blunted, blunted, blunted
Where the blunt at?
Blunted, blunted, where the blunt at?
Blunted, blunted, where the blunt at?
I got 1.5 for the blunt
Go ahead and pass me a Swisher, stay
