[Chorus: Madison Love]
I love you, even though I don't like you right now
I want you, even though you keep breaking me down
We got really high highs, really low lows
But I still love you, even though I don't like you right now

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I was tryna save us
But you got me lookin' like the villain
I had a couple mixed drinks
Now I got a couple mixed feelings
I love it, I love it
You know just how to fit in that dress
Then, I don't like it, I don't like it
Wish they had a button for your Instagram pic
We argue about this and that when
You say you need a different address
Break up to make up, hit the mattress
Wake up and you don't remember half of
The whole lotta games that we played
I ain't afraid to say when I'm wrong
And you ain't afraid to dance how you want
When your favorite song is on

[Chorus: Madison Love]
I love you, even though I don't like you right now
I want you, even though you keep breaking me down
We got really high highs, really low lows
But I still love you, even though I don't like you right now

[Post-Chorus: Madison Love]
I love you (I love you, I love you)
I want you (I want you, I want you)
I love you (I love you, I love you)
I want you, even though I don't like you right now

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
You ain't gotta say nothin', you ain't gotta say nothin'
I already know why you trippin'
I ain't had nothin' to do with them bitches
So you ain't gotta say nothin'
Six inch heel when she bust in
Should've seen my face when she rushed in
Throwin' purses, make-up and brushes

[Pre-Chorus: Madison Love]
I, I can't keep it aside
Loving with caution, caution
No, I can't see you tonight
But 2AM, I might be calling, calling

[Chorus: Madison Love]
'Cause I love you, even though I don't like you right now
I want you, even though you keep breaking me down
We got really high highs, really low lows
But I still love you, even though I don't like you right now

[Post-Chorus: Madison Love]
I don't like you, no
I, I, I don't like you no, I
I love you, I want you
I don't like you
I love you, I want you

[Chorus: Madison Love]
I love you, even though I don't like you right now
I want you, even though you keep breaking me down
We got really high highs, really low lows
But I still love you, even though I don't like you right now
