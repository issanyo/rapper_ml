[Verse 1: Leigh-Anne]
You and I and nobody else
Feeling feelings I've never felt
The way you got me under your spell
Don't you keep it all to yourself

[Pre-Chorus: Perrie]
So won't you take it?
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation, don't you keep it all to yourself

[Chorus: Jade & Leigh-Anne]
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet, all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh

[Verse 2: Jesy & (All)]
Photograph with no T-shirt on
Why you making me wait so long? (Wait so long)
I promise to keep this a secret, I'll never tell
But don't you keep it all to yourself

[Pre-Chorus: Jade]
So won't you take it?
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation, don't you keep it all to yourself

[Chorus: Jade & Leigh-Anne]
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
There ain't no need to rush
We gon' be up all night 'til the day come
You say you need just a touch
But you know I got a lot more where that came from
Back up, back up, that thang, girl
Roll up I got that flame, girl
I'ma keep doing the same, like that
If you keep touchin' my chain, like that

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
You know I've been unfair
Tryna wash my hands
I just need to hold it
Baby, let me show ya

[Chorus: Jade & Leigh-Anne & (Jade) & (Leigh-Anne) & Jesy]
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh (Just a touch)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my  whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh (Only a touch of your love)
Just a touch of your love, oh (Want a touch of your)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet, all week
Just a touch of your love (Just a touch)
Just a touch of your love (Just a touch)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, hey!
Just a touch of your love, hey!
Just a touch of your love
