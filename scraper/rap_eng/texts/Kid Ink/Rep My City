[Chorus:]
When you come to my town, see we do it big in my city
We can get this whole block shut down
When you come to my town, see a couple things that ain't pretty
I apologize if it gets wild
But we gotta represent ours
We gotta represent ours [x3]
When you come to my City

[Cflynna Verse]

In the wick im number 1
My team number 2
My ego number 3
Cuz theres no room 4 u
Im dragonfly high
And im never comin down
I reside in the clouds
And i still run this town
Im livin like a movie
Like alfred the hitch
Save the cock for ya girl
When im out of this bitch
Mr higher than most
And better than all
I do it big like sean
Cuz i never do it small
Whats the buzz about
Thats a good question
Something bout flynn
The neighborhood legend
2 L's like hall
And i dont got a pass
Jus 2 bad bitches
And a bag full of grass
Piff the same color
As my baja blast
Welcome to the future
So bye bye past
My city my town
Call it my throne
Bitch im back
Yup the king is home
