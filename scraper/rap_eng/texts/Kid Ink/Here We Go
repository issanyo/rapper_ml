[Verse 1]
Catch me if you can, gingerbread man flying somewhere outta France
All around the world I got 'em in a frenzy, life is a bitch so I'm fucking with her friend
Don't get outta line please, gon' make it look good like a dime piece
When it say 4:20 on the time piece, mean 2 blunts at time call it Siamese
Now you know how I get it, no I ain't fulfilling so the work is never finished
Start until the finish, bitch I do it statue 'bout to go cash you
Cumming right at you, better get a Kleenex, wipe me down, know I stay I the cleanest
I don't point like a V-Neck, I know that you seen it

[Chorus]
You waited all this time to get it in
We get it in, who getting it?
Take a couple shots then she giving up
Say she got a man I don't give a fuck
Here we go again, again, again
Baby here we go again, again with the same old bullshit

[Verse 2]
Yeah, in the building like a tool-kit, shooting for the stars and she know I got a full clip
I could make you famous quit with all that bullshit, baby come and chill with a cool kid
Yeah, tell me what yo name is, I can break it down Les Mis
Swear to boyfriend is the lamest, stop tripping on that nigga where yo cane is?
He shoulda never let you out, one more round we can throw in the towel
Get it wet like I turned on the valve, not a word all I heard was the vows
Oh's and the ah's, need to get a map got her losing her mind
Naw you ain't gotta be shameful I know what you came for

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yeah, on that same on bullshit, just finished the full fifth
Got me standing on the chairs like a pool pit, hold up, go
Said it's on when it's on, so fly, I'm be gone, shine bright like neon
Uh, you ain't gotta worry 'bout, I'm everything you heard about

[Chorus]
