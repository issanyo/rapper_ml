[Intro: Rico Love]
Bet you ain't know, you ain't know
When you dozed off, I was gettin' money
Yeah, I was gettin' money nigga
Fuck sleep, so fuck sleep
Fuck sleep, gettin' it
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, eyes wide open
We've been up all night, I ain't even notice, fuck sleep
You know the money is the motive
To the morning, I be hungry every moment, man a nigga gotta eat
Cookin' up, no pyrex, if's IMAX my weight up
You could check my biceps
I'm puttin' for on my team, holdin' me down like Maurice
I ain't in no hurry, to ain't got no worries
So, ain't no rest for me now
Look around and I got mo' bills than Destiny's Child
Everywhere that I go, you should know the motto
"My time is my money" and I always need mo'

[Hook: Kid Ink & Rico Love]
So fuck sleep
Cause I got a lot of bills, and nobody gon' pay 'em, but me
I keep my mind on my money, nigga I don't love these hoes
Fuck sleep!
Uhh, you could chill, when I stack these bills
Why you think these bitches love me?
Fuck sleep
Bet you ain't know, you ain't know
When you dozed off, I was gettin' money
So fuck sleep, fuck sleep
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I got her legs wide open
Late night, undercover freaks so you know it's no sheets
Then it's back to the work, fuck first and then the fifthteenth
I'm tryna get pay day erry'week
And it's tha only way to be, work hard, cause I need soft leather on the seat
See the money all the top, and the only thing I breathe
Is that California Kush, God blessed me like a sneeze
I gotta keep it real, but I'm livin' in a dream
If you made it from the bottom, then you just know what I mean
Everything on the other side ain't always what it seems
But I heard that there's some green, so I gotta go and see

[Hook: Kid Ink & Rico Love]
So fuck sleep
Cause I got a lot of bills, and nobody gon' pay 'em, but me
I keep my mind on my money, nigga I don't love these hoes
Fuck sleep!
Uhh, you could chill, when I stack these bills
Why you think these bitches love me?
Fuck sleep
Bet you ain't know, you ain't know
When you dozed off, I was gettin' money
So fuck sleep, fuck sleep
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
In the matter of the week, I make two hunnits G's
Fake niggas takin' breaks, real niggas gotta eat
I told my nigga, Jah, when you get back on the streets
I'mma drop a bag on 'em, put a Maybach on his feet
Make millions off of beats and the melodies are sweet
I keep my shades on cause I ain't slumbered in weeks
I'm dippin' down a freak, I'm bustin' off like: "Blocka, blocka!"
And sleep, I don't need nada, champagne is my Viagra

[Hook: Kid Ink & Rico Love]
So fuck sleep
Cause I got a lot of bills, and nobody gon' pay 'em, but me
I keep my mind on my money, nigga I don't love these hoes
Fuck sleep!
Uhh, you could chill, when I stack these bills
Why you think these bitches love me?
Fuck sleep
Bet you ain't know, you ain't know
When you dozed off, I was gettin' money
So fuck sleep, fuck sleep
