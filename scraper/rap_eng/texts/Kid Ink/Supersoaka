[Intro]
Yeah, you know
Murda on the beat so it's not nice

[Chorus]
Got hunnid, fifty, no stress
Bend it over, yoga stretch
Supersoaka, change clothes
Different city, same hoes
Bust a move, she got moves, yeah
You know, titties tuggin' on my jewels, yeah
You know, Stacey Dash, shawty clueless
Hands down, head clappin' with her two legs

[Verse 1]
Woo, money man on a mission
I got 'em standin' at attention
I just throw my hand like I'm fishin'
I just give that ass some ambition
I'm really hopin' I can touch it, no conditions
You say you need a shot, well I got hella ammunition
Just pop somethin' for me, while I pop another Ros√©
Now she lookin' at me like, "Don't spray"
I'm just sayin', huh, you know I'm the man, huh
Rollin' up a gram, huh, toss a couple grands high
It's your jam, huh, peanut butter skin, huh
Where you been all my life? Where you been? Huh
Parkin' lot pimpin' out at Follies (woah)
Thought I seen your ass lookin' thottie (woah woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I kill the scene, zip it up inside a body bag
And then I dump a bag on your body

[Chorus]
Got hunnid, fifty, no stress
Bend it over, yoga stretch
Supersoaka, change clothes
Different city, same hoes
Bust a move, she got moves, yeah
You know, titties tuggin' on my jewels, yeah
You know, Stacey Dash, shawty clueless
Hands down, head clappin' with her two legs

[Verse 2]
Woah
Bend it over, head and shoulders
Money shower, drop and hold it
Your friends bussin' it but you been talkin' only
I can tell you, Kelly Rowland
Baby, better get your mind and your act right
And know that I am not the holding back type
She told me sit like my hands 'round my back tied
And let her come and take me on my last ride, woah
Who am I, baby? Who am I?
Cold nigga, poe pimpin' like it's Do or Die

[Pre-Chorus]
I killed her (uh), zip it up inside a body bag
And then I throw a bag on your body

[Chorus]
Got hunnid, fifty, no stress
Bend it over, yoga stretch
Supersoaka, change clothes
Different city, same hoes
Bust a move, she got moves, yeah
You know, titties tuggin' on my jewels, yeah
You know, Stacey Dash, shawty clueless
Hands down, head clappin' with her two legs

[Outro]
You know
You know
You know
