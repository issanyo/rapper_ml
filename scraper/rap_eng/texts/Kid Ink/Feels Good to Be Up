[Verse 1]
I hope you ready to go
We in the fast lane, lettin' it blow
Movin' it full speed, foot to the floor
Now can't nobody catch me
I ain't tryna brag, get the message
I took a seat in the back, but now I'm front of the lens
I swear if they only knew, knew, just what we been (through)
Made a couple of moves, and lost a couple of friends
The only thing that ain't changed is bein' me to the end

[Pre-Hook 1]
And I keep a team watching my back
Ride or die watching my stacks
If I throw it all in the air
Promise she won't know how to act
(Man it) Feels good to be up (x4)

[Hook]
I gotta keep a bank roll, kicks on my toes
Somethin' that you've prolly never seen
I gotta keep a bad chick, ass fat as her lips
Damn girl you know just what I need
You know I gotta keep it movin' all night, know the timin' is right
All these bottles, man, she never gon' leave
I've been down but it feels good to be up
Feels good to be up
Feels good to be up
Feels good to be up

[Verse 2]
Okay, the moment is right
Take time as I walk through the light
Look around, ain't nobody in sight, that do what I do
I came from nothin' at all so tell me, what can I lose?
They tell me go hard or go home in the city where I'm from
I'ma scream loud and proud 'til there's no air in my lungs
Man feels good to be up, patron up in my cup
No care in the world, I ain't scared of nothin'

[Pre-Hook 2]
I keep a hundred ones in my lap
Keep it rollin' like craps
If I throw it all in the air
Bet I make it all back
(Man it) Feels good to be up (x4)

[Hook]
I gotta keep a bank roll, kicks on my toes
Somethin' that you've prolly never seen
I gotta keep a bad chick, ass fat as her lips
Damn girl you know just what I need
You know I gotta keep it movin' all night, know the timin' is right
All these bottles, man, she never gon' leave
I've been down but it feels good to be up
Feels good to be up
Feels good to be up
Feels good to be up

[Pre-Hook 3]
I started from nothin' it's alright
Now that we on can't tell me nothin' bout mine
You ain't know I started from nothin' it's alright
Now that we on can't tell me nothin' bout mine
You ain't know I took a seat in the back but now I'm front of the lens
If they only knew, knew, just what we been (through)
Man it feels good to be up (x4)

Feels good to be up
Feels good to be up
Feels good to be up
