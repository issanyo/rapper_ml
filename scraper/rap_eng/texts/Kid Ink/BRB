[Chorus: Kid Ink]

We don't give a f*ck about the time (yh), stuck inside a vibe (yh)
We up all night, feeling like a vampire (yh)
I see ya, I see ya over there with your crew
Shawty, get it, y'all can't get it like we do
Got it lowkey poppin' over here (yh yh)
We got it lowkey poppin' over here (yh yh)
We got it lowkey poppin' over here (yh yh)
It's lowkey poppin' over here (yh yh, we got it)

[Verse 1: Ambassador MC ]

This ain't WWE
Or UFC
So you just spare like an MOT
I won't shank a man in the R-I-B
But I'll kill the beat like RIP
There's no need for the NHS
Taking the P, WTF?
These lost people need a GPS
I'll stay true, No BS
This world is B-I-G
Thats why I keep an open E-Y-E
I love my food but don't eat D-I-G
You just move on  , [?] got HIV
Acting brave but BTW
Don't act sick in your BMW
Forget you and the NWO
You aliens go back to the UFO
I believe in G-O-D
If you don't then your a D-O-G
I'm hard to find like Ltd
Don't act like a G behind a PC
These goons just B-I-N P's
I bring quality like Sony HD
Make your eyes pop out like watching 3D
If I don't know you, IAB
Government raising the VAT
Too much violence from the G-A-T
You got no job, just an empty CV
Sell drugs, spend your life on the TV
You need to visit your GP
So don't act bad with your D & G
Don't know me, then G2K
I'm from the UK, not USA
Got love for my music like PDA
What does the future hold, IDK
Kids stole my education, they CBA
Cos they're not getting their EMA
They don't know their dad cos he's run away
And now they wanna test for your DNA
Go on, sign on
Get your JSA
Girl better know and BBK
I'm on a mission like GTA
Everyday's the same like a replay
You jump to this, even in your PJ's
So get displayed by your favourite DJ's
Haters wanna be like me
But they're infected like TV
This is R-A-P
Not RnB
So transfer this through your USB
H-H-Hold up, J-A-M
Don't say a word like S & M
Whats the hype with the BBM
KMT, so what's going on then?
Seriously, just DBI
I don't help you fakes, you DIY
When it comes to beef, feel like I G2G
But I'll straighten a man with a GHD
I move quick like 1 2 3
My memories high like an 8 GB
I ain't number O-N-E
But people look at me like OMG
Haters, Fakes, etc
Wanna hate this MC, then IDC
Really to me, It's NP
But I won't stop, I'll BRB

[Chorus: Kid Ink]

We got it lowkey poppin' over here (yh yh)
We got it lowkey poppin' over here (yh yh)
It's lowkey poppin' over here (yh yh, we got it)
