[Hook: Kid Ink]

It goes work all day, up all night
You can tell 'em that I live that life
One hand got a cup full of drink
Feelin' so right, gon' party baby til' we see the light
You can tell em' that it's bat bat gang
Bat tat tat gang, bat gang bat tat gang
Bat gang, bat gang, bat gang, bat tat gang

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]

Yeah, 4 B's and we in here
Bat gang bitch, big business, up all night long
They left me all alone, try to told them not to let me in my zone
Motherfucker now it's on
Bat tat tat gang, undefeated since a nigga left the old team
H-H-Hands up, Super Bowl ring
A-A-Alumni bitch, 3 chains
Going global you lo-cal
What chu know about livin' out the hotel
No groupies in my room cause them hoes tell
Talks cheap and you niggas got it wholesale
All I do is win, know the goal well
So hot, think I might melt
Its nothing you can tell em that this easy I can finally feel my breezy swear that can't nobody see me in this muh fucka

[Hook: Kid Ink]

[Verse 2: Hardhead]

Wings out, let my fangs show
I ain't never been a fake type
Approach Ink in the wrong way get lit
One step like a break light
Bat gang watch it take flight
No sleep up late nights
Zombies, dead men walk right up outta that grave site
Styrofoam, d-double cup, bad bitch d-double D's
Belt and shoes got double G's
We the number one Big Mac with the double cheese
So what the fuck you thinkin'? Whoever you want just bring it
Because we shuttin' bars down like it's underage drinkin'
You ain't never catch me in the box stuck
Bitches ridin' my dick is the only way I'm fuckin' up
We took the long way and went the scenic route
Now we everywhere and we never ever see you out
You're tough talk get at me like Twitter nigga
Man wanna be in our shoes but they don't fit a nigga
Yeah, it's 4 B's and we in this
Bat gang bitch and all we do is big business
