Clap for a clap, clap for a clap
Because the girl right there, yeah she all that
She says she was a model, until the stretch marks follow
From a pregnancy
But baby girl you Colorado
And if you bounce that ass, Im gonna fuck it like a bronco
I dont care about your baggage, Im good with moving cargo
Your love is the motto, so you better hit this bottle
You deserve the world, let me give rap
If love was a drug, then you would be my
I swear it its tragic, something tragic
Every time she comes around, I swear I gotta have it
I know what you done heard, yeah its probably true
But I swear to god you for something new
So lets not waste more time, baby skip that line
She said its deja vu, I said its love in

I see in those eyes that, you already read my mind
So we ain't gotta waste no time
We ain't gotta waste no time girl
The name should be on the guest list
I dont really use no
We ain't gotta waste no time
We ain't gotta waste no time, girl

Clap for a clap, clap for a clap
Because the girl right there, yeah she all that
I need you on my team
A king ain't shit without his throne
He can run that village, but a queen runs a home
The most, let the feeling unfold
Youre scared, I know, but you
Damn, you always hide from cameras
Make it so hard like cancer
And nah, we dont do that
But you work too hard to be on food stamps
You scream
You say you got a man, but uh, where he at
Yeah, you flying, south west
Man youre my heart, like FedEx
Got your mind wondering like whats next
Im probably not your last, but Ill be the best

I see in those eyes that, you already read my mind
So we ain't gotta waste no time
We ain't gotta waste no time girl
The name should be on the guest list
I dont really use no
We ain't gotta waste no time
We ain't gotta waste no time, girl
