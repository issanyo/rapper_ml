[Bow Wow:]
Girl I can’t lie, it’s bomb as fuck
And like a U-Haul truck I watch her back it up
She do that thing with her tongue, that’s what’s up
Then roll a blunt right after we fuck
Pop a molly, It’s ’bout to get crazy
Girl stand back and catch these babies
I’m gettin’ impatient, girl I’m feelin’ anxious
She said she don’t fuck on a first night basis

[Hook:]
I got pussy on my mind (That’s all I do)
I think about your pussy all the time (That’s e’ryday)
I thought I saw a puddy cat, pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can’t stop thinkin’ ’bout it you know I got that pussy on my mind

[Kid Ink:]
Yeah, that’s all I think about
You ain’t even gotta ask, girl I’ll eat you out
Like I ain’t had a meal, you know I’m fiending for it
Talking freaky like you grew up in a circus girl
You must be on a pill, or too much of Patron
Mixed with that mo’ wet, tugging on my Fendi belt
Let’s hit the tel, just promise you won’t tell
It don’t stop running through my head I work it out
You know that

[Hook:]
I got pussy on my mind (That’s all I do)
I think about your pussy all the time (That’s e’ryday)
I thought I saw a puddy cat, pussy on my mind
(Front back side, you know how I hit it)
I did, I did, I did swear I got that pussy on my mind
(Front back side, you know how I hit it)
And I can’t stop thinkin’ ’bout it you know I got that pussy on my mind

[Bow Wow:]
I think I’m dreamin’
Cause you look like that girl I met last weekend
Shawty bad, yeah she fine
Hit it from the back, know she feel it in her spine
Cause I be fiendin’ for her, I be missin’ it
Put it in my face, can I have a lick?
Can I have a lick? can I have a lick?
Can I, can I, can I, can I have a lick?

[Hook:]
I got pussy on my mind (That’s all I do)
I think about your pussy all the time (That’s e’ryday)
I thought I saw a puddy cat, pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can’t stop thinkin’ ’bout it you know I got that pussy on my mind

[Bridge:]
Always on my mind, always on my mind
Not a day go by, when it ain’t on my mind
Always on my mind, always on my mind
Not a day go by, when it ain’t on my mind

[Hook:]
I got pussy on my mind (That’s all I do)
I think about your pussy all the time (That’s e’ryday)
I thought I saw a puddy cat, pussy on my mind
I did, I did, I did swear I got that pussy on my mind
And I can’t stop thinkin’ ’bout it you know I got that pussy on my mind
