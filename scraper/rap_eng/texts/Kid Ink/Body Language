[Chorus:]
It's not a lot that you've been saying, whoa
But I can tell from your body language
Okay let's talk about it, is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it , can we talk about it?
But you ain't gotta say too much, you ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much

[Bridge:]
Oh, they say don't judge a book by its cover
We can make a scene that you be under the cover
Listen, you ain't gotta say too much, you ain't gotta say too much
You ain't gotta say much, you ain't gotta say much, girl I'm talking, girl I'm listening, come closer, let me hear ya
