[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck about the time, stuck inside the vibe
We be up all night, feeling like a vampire
I see ya, Isee ya over there with ya crew
Shawty get it, you can't get it like we do
Got it lowkey popping over here
We got it lowkey popping over here
We got it lowkey popping over here
It's lowkey popping over here

[Verse 1 ]
Now if you meet me in the club, guarantee to see a bottle pop
Know we got it lowkey popping like a bottom lock
And I don't know the time but I know we on a model watch
Cause early in the morning, tell 'em toast, Mazel Tov
Said I'm 'bout to put it down, emo
Soon as I walk in they jump on me like vino
Very important people got their hands up like a heist
And baby let me get you right, hope you not afraid of heights
All night, damn right, I gotta full prescription
I'll be stuck inside a Vibe, gotta full subscriptions
Taking shot after shot, like a full blown semi
Do it big, never mini Yao Ming could tell â€˜em!

[Chorus]
We don't give a fuck about the time, stuck inside the fire
We be up all night, feeling like a vampire
I see ya, I see ya over there with ya crew
Shawty get it, you can't get it like we do
Got it lowkey popping over here
We got it lowkey popping over here
We got it lowkey popping over here
It's lowkey popping over here

[Verse 2]
Packed to the ceiling got everybody inside here
Going going crazy, club look like an asylum
I think I'm Criss Angel, feel like I can levitate
While everybody stares, I think that I'mma take the elevator
See you at the top, you may spot me like a freckle
Pocket full of presidentials, rozay redder than a vessel
Got me twisted like a pretzel, you ain't nowhere on my level ho
Breezy as a polar bear, cooler than a eskimo
With bitches on my back, whole world on my shoulders
You can tell the bartender make my drink a little stronger
Smoky as a locomotive on the train to the sky
Know we been here for a while, might have lost track of my mind but tell 'em

[Chorus x2]
