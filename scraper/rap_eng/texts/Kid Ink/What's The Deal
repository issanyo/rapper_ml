[Intro: Math Allen]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh
Oh

[Hook: Math Allen & Kid Ink]
Tell me what to do 'fore I fall out
See all you gotta do
Is play your cards right, right
Tell me it's a go, give the green light, go
You know I might act a fool on it
Fool on it, nigga
Tell me what's the deal, t-tell me what's the deal
Tell me what's the deal, t-tell me what's the deal
Tell me it's a go, give the green light
Put it on it, I put it on it
On it
Put it on it, I put it on
You know I might act a fool on it
On it
Put it on it, put it on it
I act a fool on it

[Verse 1: Shitty Montana]
Tell me what it is
Tell me what's the deal
Cuz once I pop this, pop this
Shit might just get real
Might tell you that I love ya babe
But I ain't payin' no bills
I take you out for a meal
But no bag no heels
I don't get down like that
You know I'm actin' a fool on it
Can't trust no bitch
I'm sleepin' with my tool on me
It's a dirty game
You know it ain't no rules on it
They give me the green light
So I could move on it

[Hook: Math Allen & Kid Ink]
Tell me what to do 'fore I fall out
See all you gotta do
Is play your cards right, right
Tell me it's a go, give the green light, go
You know I might act a fool on it
Fool on it, nigga
Tell me what's the deal, t-tell me what's the deal
Tell me what's the deal, t-tell me what's the deal
Tell me it's a go, give the green light
Put it on it, I put it on it

[Verse 2: Juliann Alexander]
Me with a bottle and a Instagram model
That's the perfect picture
Bad bitches turnin'
Let's be honest man, I been that nigga
Why you so stuck in your feelings
Geekin', I ain't got no feelings
She gone take it to the ceiling
Bust it like it's for a milli
All my bitches hella rude
Them bitches ain't fuckin' you
They don't like no pussy niggas
Them bitches is duckin' you
And I been puttin' in that work
Monday to Monday
I got that pack on me
Been flexin' since a youngin'

[Hook: Math Allen & Kid Ink]
Tell me what to do 'fore I fall out
See all you gotta do
Is play your cards right, right
Tell me it's a go, give the green light, go
You know I might act a fool on it
Fool on it, nigga

[Outro: Math Allen & Kid Ink]
Tell me what's the deal
Put it on
I put it on
