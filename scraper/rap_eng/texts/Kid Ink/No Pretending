[Verse 1]
I said this life that i'm living is no pretending
I'm not just saying that I'm not like them
They ain't my foes but they ain't my friends
Know so many pair 10s couldn't walk in my Timbs
Good Lord thank God saying all my hems
Take care of my family and all my M's
When I die you can bury me in all my dough
Young taught you can bury me with all my own
Made it all on my own I'ma take it all with me
Nigga worked too hard I ain't taken off a week
I ain't taken everything that these niggas offer me
Money go around the room like that shit is offering
Liquor got her singing off a beat
Dancing round the room I just think you lost your seat
All these bottles I just need somewhere to pour em
And a lighter so that I can start a fire in the foreign

[Hook]
The way i'm feeling we the only thing trending
There ain't no pretending
You gotta talk it when you walking my way
Ain't no pretending
(No!)
(No!)
There ain't no pretending
Said:

[Verse 2]
I said the shit that I'm spitting is no pretending
I can barely see you niggas through the tint in my lens
Living in a dog world baby pass me the light
Prolly drinking everything that you pass me tonight
W-west side nigga on a beach with a barbie
Reaching from 'er jeans like she reaching for Atari
Made it out the jungle had a lease in the safari
Now crease in Miama you can't see my army
Everything in camo I just make a call and everything is handled
Handel keys open doors and I got one to my city and a pent house realist in the building no pretending
I said:

[Hook]
The way i'm feeling we the only thing trending
There ain't no pretending
You gotta talk it when you walking my way
There ain't no pretending
(No!)
(No!)
There ain't no pretending
Said:

[Verse 3]
(No!)
(No!)
There ain't no...
(Whoa)
The way i'm feeling i'm the only thing
Itching for the dream it only seems
These niggas making movies but they only scenes
I gotta foreplay the way i mean
I'm tryna make sure the fat lady only sings
They tried to turn me to a puppet hung 'em by the strings I light 'em up and puff puff baby by the strings
With the window down (Skrrtin) in and out of lane

[Outro:]
(No!)
There ain't no pretending
Said...
