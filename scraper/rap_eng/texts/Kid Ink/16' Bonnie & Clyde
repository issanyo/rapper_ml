[Hook]
It's just me and my girlfriend
Hangin' out the window of the ride
We the new Bonnie & Clyde
She just want the diamonds and the pearls
But we could take over the world
It's just me and my girlfriend
Don't you be surprised
She might have that rocket on the side
I swear my baby, she so thorough
I wouldn't trade her for the world

[Verse 1]
You could look for me
See my baby girl do more than just cook for me
If I ever took a hit, she pay them books for me
That's why I tell her every mornin' that she look like Bey
And we smoke like RiRi, wallpaper the ceilin'
Get it poppin' like Remy, don't wanna see her get even
It ain't too much we don't agree say
I sip champagne and she drink ReeSlim
I make sure that she dressed ahead of season
Cause the head she give is genius
She the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet but
Unfriendly with that street shit, it's somewhere in her genes, aw yeah
It ain't too much room with that fat ass
In them heels, it look hard for you to balance
Even when it's all eyes on me
All I need in this life of sin, nigga

[Hook]
Is me and my girlfriend
Hangin' out the window of the ride
We the new Bonnie & Clyde
She just want the diamonds and the pearls
But we could take over the world
It's just me and my girlfriend
Don't you be surprised
She might have that rocket on the side
I swear my baby, she so thorough
I wouldn't trade her for the world

[Verse 2]
I said it's young Ink cruisin' down the westside
2 seater, speedin' on the 45
Highway, ain't no traffic round this time
Hit the club just cause we woke up in the middle of the night
She love goin' downtown to watch the Clippers with me
In Magic City, throw some dollars, just some strippers with me
While they poppin' pussy, she be poppin' some prescriptions with me
Is we really takin' shots or y'all pistol whippin'?
Just let the night begin
She been the same since the night we met
Swear I like it when she turn freak when the lights is dim
All I need in this life of sin, nigga

[Hook]
Is me and my girlfriend
Hangin' out the window of the ride
We the new Bonnie & Clyde
She just want the diamonds and the pearls
But we could take over the world
It's just me and my girlfriend
Don't you be surprised
She might have that rocket on the side
I swear my baby, she so thorough
I wouldn't trade her for the world
