[Hook]
Free TC, free TC, e-e-e-e-everywhere I go, even though you're gone, you'll never be alone. (x2)
Woah woah woah, woah woah woah, woah woah woah, woah woah woah

[Verse 1: Ty$]
Looking in the mirror like damn I made it
Sometimes I wish we could trade places
You deserve it more than I do bro
I know you would've been a better dad than I am bro
I know you would've said fuck music a family first
I'm gone all the time I know my family hurts
When I'm all alone with my headphones on
I'm like fuck whoever made up life goes on
That's why time goes by, puffing on lie, hoping that it gets me high
Got a nigga going crazy
I'm going crazy
Don't trip we gone get you home man, don't
God won't give you nothing that you can't handle
Don't trip we gone get you home man , don't
God won't give you nothing that you can't handle

[Verse 2: TeeCee4800]
I'm on the block reminiscing
85 to life gave my bro max sentence
A real ? out the bunch
Always kept his binder but was quick to nuckaluck
Washington and vanguard made a few bucks
Gave him rain late night smoking weed and getting drunk
Schoolyard nigga these niggas know what's up
Got niggas from the set that's probably happy that you locked up
Only 19 but live the fast life
Money, cars, and fucking bitches all night
It's a damn shame didn't even do it getting life
I'mma get you out as soon as this money get right
And yeah I'm still with ??
And yeah I got my grind mode
Don't trip we gone get you home man don't
God won't give you nothing that you can't handle

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
Screaming Big Chepe Jose, I'll see you one day
Know that you're at home
So I look into the sky and blow the smoke
Man I swear this whole thing feels like a joke
When I was just with you talking about the future
Now I'm with your family talking about the funeral
Who knew I was gonna come and hang out that night
But it's no refunds and you paid that price
It's a bribery, kids find the list
Gotta ask mom where they father is
Try looking at the man in the mirror
But these haters in the way like a pass interference
Know you tax other niggas knowing all my freak
Now I gotta get your name with a R.I.P
Still looking for the name on the caller I.D
Put a drink in the air homie and tell 'em
