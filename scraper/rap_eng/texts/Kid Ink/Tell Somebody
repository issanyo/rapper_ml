[Verse 1]
After all the shit we did
You gon' make me have to tell somebody, make me tell somebody
Plead the fifth
But in my mind I wanna tell somebody, wanna tell somebody
The way I hit it, ohhhh you gon' make me have to surf on that ocean
I might drown in your body let it drip
But you so bad I gotta tell somebody, gotta tell somebody

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh my my my
You really blowing my mind
Oh, oh, oh my my my
I ain't wasting no time
Tell her hop on that quick
And shade, fuck it up
Do your dance, run it back
We been on one
Fall Back
I will not snitch
Fuck it up, do your dance
Turn around and baby run it back
I wish I could tell somebody

[Verse 2]
First off, no I ain't the type to go kiss and tell everything
And I'm so drunk that if I try it I misspell everything
And you so drunk that you dance to like everything that come on
We been mixing up these feelings with Hennessy and Patron
Now you feeling the wave and I'm 'bout to jump in the deep-end
I know that you tryna escape, and be my little secret

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh my my my
You really blowing my mind
Oh, oh, oh my my my
I ain't wasting no time
Tell her hop on that quick
And shade, fuck it up
Do your dance, run it back
We been on one
Fall Back
I will not snitch
Fuck it up, do your dance
Turn around and baby run it back
I wish I could tell somebody

[Verse 3]
After all the shit we did
You gon' make me have to tell somebody, make me tell somebody
Plead the fifth
But in my mind I wanna tell somebody, wanna tell somebody
The way I hit it, ohhhh you gon' make me have to surf on that ocean
I might drown in your body let it drip
But you so bad I gotta tell somebody, gotta tell somebody

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh my my my
You really blowing my mind
Oh, oh, oh my my my
I ain't wasting no time
Tell her hop on that quick
And shade, fuck it up
Do your dance, run it back
We been on one
Fall Back
I will not snitch
Fuck it up, do your dance
Turn around and baby run it back
I wish I could tell somebody

[Outro]
I should tell somebody about you
That body you showin' off, girl you should be proud to
That outfit you got on, I'm tryna get you out boo
So glad that I found you, let's dip
You don't really need the bullshit around you
Still something in the fifth
Hope you ready for round two
