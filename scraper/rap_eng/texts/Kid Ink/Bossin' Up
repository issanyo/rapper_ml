[Intro:]
Okay
Bossin' up
You, you can check we bossin'

[Hook: 2x]
Yeah
Valet park my whip nigga
Hammer time for my chips nigga
(Bossin' up!)
Add it up, your girlfriend choosin' so you mad as fuck, okay
Chillin' with my coalition nigga's rackin' up
(Bossin' up) A-Add it up
(Bossin' up) A-Add it up
A lil' Louis but my bitch wants some bags and stuff

[Verse 1:]
It go
Valet when I park it
OG when I spark it
Money speak when I'm talkin'
J-J-J's on when I'm walking
Stay fired up like arson
You can't touch my garments
Up late nights pass Carson
Drinkin' large proportions of that turn up, juice
Got your girlfriend, loose
Shakin' that ass listening to Luke
Give a nigga all holes no loops
Give a nigga all brain no lip
I be at the bar hanging no grip
Pant saggin' no four fifth
My security bullets like 4 inches
Kick that shit like four ninjas
Did that shit for my nigga's who
Made it out the hood to the good side
B-bossin' up with no tie
You heard it through the grape vine
And I was actually there, Yeah
It's clear who's been gettin' to the bread like Panera, ugh

[Hook: 2x]
