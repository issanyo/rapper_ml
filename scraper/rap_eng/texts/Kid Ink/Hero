[Intro] (Queen)
On(on) and on(on and on), does anybody know another hero
Another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on

[Verse 1]
Lights, cameras, action
On me I'm the main attraction
High off life, match one
This is only the beginning, act one
They dont wanna see me act up
Its kinda hard in the game full of actors
But this the real world, drinking like roofy
Doubt if I remember tonight roofy

But I'mma make sure they remember me
Running like I got the legs of a centipede
Nah I ain't ever trippin
I know all the rules, but I ain't never listen
I can only hear the crowd
Its gettin loud
My mom famous now

Yeah, you ain't gotta know
But they gon tell you im the best, when the curtains close
Uh and the story goes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah(Yeah) get ready for act two
This will be the greatest show you ever sat through
New to you
But this shit is past due
Gettin money now, bills never pass due
I only did what I had to
Fast break, Ill threw me the alley oop
Uh, I maybe more like caterpoe
Now im all on there, cantelopes

I hope ya'll happy
And when im done, ladies throw your draws at me
In the game im the star athlete
Kobe, no LeBron actually
No need for a act three
I breathe
Master piece

Rap's Scorsese
I'm your hero but who gon save me
And the story goes

[Hook]
