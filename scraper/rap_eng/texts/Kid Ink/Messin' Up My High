[Hook]
I've been waiting for this song, all night
Sorry if I can't talk right now
But you messing up my high, high high high
Said you messing up my high, high high high
Don't wanna hear what you're talking 'bout
Don't wanna hear what you're talking 'bout
Don't wanna hear what you're talking 'bout
Just turn up the music
Don't wanna hear what you're talking 'bout
Don't wanna hear what you're talking 'bout
Don't wanna hear what you're talking 'bout
Just turn up the music

[Verse 1]
Turn it up, little higher
I just took a shot, got me feeling wired
I ain't finna talk, I came to shut it down
And I know you're tired with your running mouth
So give me 50 feet, please let the speakers break
Nah you donâ€™t need to sing or say a thing
Cause you messing up the song sorry but you messing up my zone

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Super high, Scotty beam me up
Buzz kill, why you tryna bring me down?
Shoe fly, cause I'm too fly
Talking out yo ass, 2 ply
I don't care what the word is
I'm sitting high on the plan no service
You're breaking up like a girl do
No I ain't tryna be rude

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Sorry I ain't tryna have a conversation right now
Just tryna hear the music with the speakers up loud
Feel good on the high I ain't tryna come down
I just need you to turn up the volume, turn up the volume, can you turn up the volume? Uh

[Hook]
