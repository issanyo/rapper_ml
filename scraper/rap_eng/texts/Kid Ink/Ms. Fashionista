[Intro]
Woop
Egh!
You know we going out right
I know you need some time to get ready and all
Well alright
Go ahead
But first

[Verse 1]
I got a question so important
Should I wear the Timbs or the Jordans
Fresh to death, dead as the morgue and
You niggas dress like mormons
Tonight think I'ma get em all
Pull these out and I'ma kill 'em all
Almost ready but you hopping in the shower
I'ma pre-game girl you got about an hour
Never mind know you need bout two
Whole 30 minutes just trying on shoes
Nine times out of ten I be showing up drunk
One more shot then throw it in the trunk
Straight to the back it's a line in the front
You know how I roll out when I roll up
Got a pack full of Swishers and some pre-rolled blunts
Champagne dinner had a Patron lunch

[Hook]
Girl you know its time to go
But you always moving slow
Ms. Fashionista (My)
Ms. Fashionista (My)
Now why you gotta take so long
Couldn't get more beautiful
Ms. Fashionista (My)
Ms. Fashionista (My)

[Verse 2]
Yeah I gotta make a decision
Should I wear the leather or the denim
It don't matter the weather or the season
Summer time but a nigga fall line fitting
I'ma be too on for the night
Heels to high insecure about your height
But it's alright you're just my type
You're first class fly get a meal with your flight
Ms. Fashionista
Pass the shisha this just the teaser
It'll be a movie by the end of the evening
Shots out the uzi just take it easy, wait
I'll tell you when it's time to go
Tryna get you high we the honor roll yeah
Looking at your body time is frozen
Bring you jacket it's kinda cold said

[Hook x2]
