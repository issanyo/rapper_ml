[Hook]
I made history, you told that
Realest shit I wrote in my notepad
Ain't left 'bout the game, nigga no stats
Cut the cheque, no I don't cut 'em no slack

[Verse 1]
Put that shit on wax, you know 'bout the grind
I put in work in that overtime
Clocking in at 9, clocking out at 9
Cut the motherfuckin' cheque, get to shoppin' now
Here we go again, smoke up 'til the sunny sky
I ain't been to sleep since the other night
My baby know I'm always late to supper times
So she leave it in the stove with the oven light on
Keep it warm for a nigga 'til I'm back home
Put it to my mouth like a saxophone
Batphone, text on the Samsung
And the realest shit I wrote was a ransom
Young, handsome nigga with a hand full of money
I blow it baby, if you bust a dance move
Drive my tyre in Miami Vice on a boat
Blazin', no tyres, no buttons, just my tattoos
How I'm feelin', play like I invented
I brought the old me back for new beginnings
Where we from now make it to my lifespan
And you could blame my daddy if I'm actin' light skinned

[Hook]
I made history, you told that
Realest shit I wrote in my notepad
Ain't left 'bout the game, nigga no stats
Cut the cheque, no I don't cut 'em no slack

[Verse 2]
My ambitions in designer, Dolce & Gabanna
All this courtesy champagne while I'm shoppin'
Got a nigga thrown, I'm 'bout buy the whole store
In the dressin' room, bitch keep peakin' through the door
Bathroom break, prolly' sneakin', geekin' on the low
Skiin' through the slopes, one thing is for sure
You ain't gotta say yes if I offer you the drugs
I'm a bad influence but I'm better than I was, baby
Used to hit the dirty money with the suds
Now I walk over the road, big show in the club, baby
My mama tell me never fear no one
Grab the blunt by the neck and I chokeslam
Might show up to the beach with my own sand
I brought the whole thing and these hoes in
Kurt Cobain, you know where the shot go
I just need a refill, I'm tryna reload

[Hook]
I made history, you told that
Realest shit I wrote in my notepad
Ain't left 'bout the game, nigga no stats
Cut the cheque, no I don't cut 'em no slack

[Outro]
Realest shit I wrote in my notepad
