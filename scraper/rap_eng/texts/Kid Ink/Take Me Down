[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah, say they know how to find me
Just look up in the sky, haha
You see me going, fly away
You know what it is, I said

[Chorus: Chrishan]
I'm the first class flight head to the clouds
And you can never take me down, take me down, take me down (I said you can never take me down)
I know you probably mad at me now
But you can't take me down, take me down, take me down, but you can take it now (I said you can never take me down)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
You can never take me down, I came too far for you to break me down now
It ain't even the same since you found out, shit be getting dirtier than down south
Mo money, mo problems, BIG said it, trying not to let this fame get me big headed
They say I'm luckier than 6 7, try to tell you motherfuckers than this shit's destined
And I can only live me life, I know it's hard for you to see me through the limelight
And you can't even tell me why you mad, madder than the Hatter always saying something bad
Tell me does it shock you to see me? Cause these people paid a lot to come see me
Never change like a hospital TV, cause they smoking like the top of a teepee, I said

[Chorus: Chrishan]
I'm the first class flight head to the clouds
And you can never take me down, take me down, take me down (I said you can never take me down)
I know you probably mad at me now
But you can't take me down, take me down, take me down, but you can take it now (I said you can never take me down)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
No, this is everything I live towards, I'm sorry if you think I coulda did more
But tell me what I gotta front for? Can't knock my hustle like a front door
You can't touch me like the front room, you know when I spit it's like a monsoon
Somebody call 911, swear they gon' need a stretcher when I'm done
Money money money, only money on my mind, four chains, I can make it sunny all the time
If I get out of line, please don't blame me, I'm only an example of what the world made me
So drinks up 'til I'm six down, somebody roll up, I need a hit now
I said Judy couldn't judge me, so high baby, ain't no one above me, I'm on

[Chorus: Chrishan]
I'm the first class flight head to the clouds
And you can never take me down, take me down, take me down (I said you can never take me down)
I know you probably mad at me now
But you can't take me down, take me down, take me down, but you can take it now (I said you can never take me down)
