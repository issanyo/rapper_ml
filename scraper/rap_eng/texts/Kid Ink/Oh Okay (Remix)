[Intro: Kid Ink]
Aye, oh yeah
Run that back turbo
(woo) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo

[Chorus: Gunna]
Audemar wrist, count it then spend it
Matted the coupe, and my windows tinted
Chop off the top, headed to Lenox
I got some cash, I wanna spend it
New paper tag, didn't wanna rent it
Too many bags, too many bitches
Roll with my slime, yeah that my lizard
Ready to slide, you will get slithered
Hey, we ain't got ties, yeen gon' ride
Yeen my slime, yeen my slime
Young Gunna Gunna, I'm in my prime
Hey, so authentic, not tellin' you lies
When it comes to business I'm handling mine
Yeah, I'ma kingface Patek my time

[Verse: Kid Ink]
Kid Ink
Run through the lobby with all of my niggas (Okay)
Say you the bro, but you more like a sister (Okay)
Most of these rappers is cool, only in pictures (Okay)
Swear when I walk out the room, these niggas be dissin' (Okay)
Wait, I tried to play like a fool, watch how my enemies move
Ain't got a clue, it could get poppin' like fool
Don't let these pop-records fool (Oh yeah)
Came from the hood, know that the money don't make it no different (Okay)
We could take it to back in the day and start reminiscing (Okay)
I can read back on the mission, whipping that shit with a venegance
All of my windows is tinted, 'Rari look blacker than Venom
Only got clue on a denim
All over money I spent it (Wait)
It's only real gold on your lil' chain
Still I ain't never saw no chain
'Member when I brought you on stage
Back when you niggas had no name (Okay)
Rollin' up all of my Backwoods
Tell me now when did your mood change? (Okay)
You niggas be going through mood swings (Wait)
And it start runnin' like Usain (Hey)
You need to be worried 'bout your boo thang (yeah)
I got her in the pocket like loose change, woah, woah
Now you think that this your summer
Most you niggas one-hit wonders, don't let that shit go right to your head (Oh yeah)
Why they trynna put me under, now I'm back to get revenge on everybody that left me for dead

[Chorus: Gunna]
Audemar wrist, count it then spend it
Matted the coupe, and my windows tinted
Chop off the top, headed to Lenox
I got some cash, I wanna spend it
New paper tag, didn't wanna rent it
Too many bags, too many bitches
Roll with my slime, yeah that my lizard
Ready to slide, you will get slithered
Hey, we ain't got ties, yeen gon' ride
Yeen my slime, yeen my slime
Young Gunna Gunna, I'm in my prime
Hey, so authentic, not tellin' you lies
When it comes to business I'm handling mine
Yeah, I'ma kingface Patek my time
