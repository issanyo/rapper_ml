[Post-Hook]
Well, you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Yes I am (x3)
I'm the man (x3)

[Verse 1]
I believe every lie that I ever told
Paid for every heart that I ever stole
I played my cards and I didn't fold
Well it ain't that hard when you got soul
(This is my world)
Somewhere I heard that, life is a test
And I've been through the worst, but I still give my best
God made my mold different from the rest
Then he broke that mold so I know I'm blessed
(This is my world)

[Pre-Hook]
Stand up now and face the sun
Won't hide my tail or turn and run
It's time to do what must be done
And be a king when kingdom comes

[Hook]
Well, you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Well, you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Yes I am (x3)
I'm the man (x3)

[Kid Ink]
Egh, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Feels like, the city is right in my hands
I caught 'em off guard but its always been a plan
Bigger than anything you could ever understand, ohh man (oh man)
Oh god can you hear the, stress when there is nothing to roll it in this
All on me to take care of the fam, I hope in the end you take care of my sins now
I, been around, been around, my, team strong & I gotta hold 'em down
Just, keep strong it'll be your turn, but for now, I don't know what you heard
But I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

[Aloe]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Yes I am (x3)
I'm the man (x3)

[Verse] 2
I got all the answers to your questions
I'll be the teacher you could be the lesson
I'll be the preacher you be confession
I'll be the quick relief to all your stressing
(This is my world)
It's a thin line between love and hate
Is you really real or is you really fake?
I'm a soldier standing on my feet
No surrender and I won't retreat
(This is my world)

[PreHook]
Stand up now and face the sun
Won't hide my tail or turn and run
It's time to do what must be done
And be a king when kingdom comes

[Post-Hook]
Well, you can tell everybody
Yeah you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Yes I am (x3)
I'm the man (x3)

[Bridge]
I'm the man
Go ahead and tell everybody
What I'm saying y'all
(Everybodyyyy)
I'm the man
Go ahead and tell everybody
Hearing what I'm saying y'all
