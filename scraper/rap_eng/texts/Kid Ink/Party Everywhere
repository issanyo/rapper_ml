(Hook)(2x)
Said its a party everywhere
Party everywhere (3x)
There we go
Put your lighters in the air, let it blow
You know the club just close but we gon keep it goin’

(Verse 1)
See you better get familiar
Me & My familia
In it like a splinter, get it right from the beginning (uh)
Shut it down, hit control alt delete
How i’m eatin', chow like the meat BITCH
Come and find me somewhere on the premise
Yeah we in the building, tell the super intindent
That i’m bout to go dumb, I got stupid intentions
And my pockets on pinch, living dream, come and pinch me (EGHH!)
Ima young fly hero, super ego, tatted like a chico
Up all night like the club and casino
No sleep, I don't count sheep, just zero
Its a late night affair
Cheatin’ on the sun, smokin’ on a flare
Standing on a chair, got bitches everywhere
Now you already know, its a party over here

(Hook)(2x)

(Verse 2)
Keep it rolling, ash in the cup
Girlfriend wit’ me got a ass fat as fuck
Ain’t a song for your kids, this grown up, Money
All this paper goin’ around, startin' to look like mummy (EGH!!)
Party never over
Far away from sober
Flyer than a lotus
I said i’m high, not olimpish
You can take it to the face, see you in the third dimension
Im such a fool, too cool for school
See me breaking all the rules
Like a kit kat, straight from the club to the kick back
You know where we at, tatted right above the six pack
Mr hollywood, to the hood
Bitch im good
Nigga never get it misunderstood
In the air, going over niggas head like a sattelite
You know what we having right?

(Hook)(2x)

(Outro)
I usually don't do this but
We gon keep it going
Roll up
Kid ink
