[Chorus: Fuzz Rico]
Throw up more bands
Make it rain dance
Cancel your plan
Bet I'll pay you advance
Oh, that’s your man
Well he catch it back
He can throw some at me
Bet it pay off your rent
Throw up more bands
Make it rain dance
Cancel your plan
Bet I'll pay you advance
Oh that's your man
Well he catch it back
He can throw some at me
Bet it pay off your rent

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Run that back like (Like)
I need a replay (Ha, damn, uh, damn, wait)
I’ll be the DJ (Err)
Freaks out at night (Late night)
She like "how high?" (How high?)
Got my bitch with me so I don't need alibi (No lie)
Saturday night, Sunday, she play them types (Aw yeah)
Roll up that OG, now I'm the chief of the tribe (Woohoo)
Baby girl Santa Fe (Ayy)
She got that thing on her waist (Ayy)
I got the band to play (wait)
Come make a band today (Ow)
Sitting up way at the top (Top)
Swear the floor looking amiss (Ayy)
I keep on taking these shots (Woo)
Feel like I got on a vest (Ayy)
Put that shit up like I'm Reggie (Ugh)
Turn a ho into confetti (Woo)
Tell her, "Just shut up and dance" (Dance)
Got that advance, throw up more

[Chorus: Fuzz Rico]
Throw up more bands
Make it rain dance
Cancel your plan
Bet I'll pay you advance
Oh, that's your man
Well he catch it back
He can throw some at me
Bet it pay off your rent
Throw up more bands
Make it rain dance
Cancel your plan
Bet I'll pay you advance
Oh that's your man
Well he catch it back
He can throw some at me
Bet it pay off your rent

[Verse 2: Valee]
I’m smoking exotic
I’m in a four-door sedan (Sedan)
My sneakers 2000 dollars (Dollars)
Go for my pictures in Hermes (Hermes)
I might change her flat in Off White (Off White)
I got a bad bitch in my sight (My sight)
I might have threw ten thousand last night (Yeah)
I might do 180 in fast lane (Fast lane)
I might put that bitch in Philipp Plein (Philipp)
I pull up on you in a stick shift (Stick)
I got a redbone and she thick (Thick)
I throw out money for designer (Designer)
My Balmains ran me four thousand (Thousand)
I'm spending that like I don’t need that
You not as sexual, now you where we at
My dope sound like it's giving feedback (Feedback)

[Chorus: Fuzz Rico]
Throw up more bands
Make it rain dance
Cancel your plan
Bet I'll pay you advance
Oh, that's your man
Well he catch it back
He can throw some at me
Bet it pay off your rent
Throw up more bands
Make it rain dance
Cancel your plan
Bet I’ll pay you advance
Oh that's your man
Well he catch it back
He can throw some at me
Bet it pay off your rent
