[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
Cause I'm a daydreamer, a daydreamer
A daydreamer, daydreamer
And I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
'Til the morning, 'til the morning

[Verse 1]
Yeah cause we got one life to live can't be cloned, no
I don't care where we go, any place but home, the show goes on
Cameras action, throw it in the air like graduates
New money new accents, a whole new world like Jasmine
Let me take you there, probably never thought we make it here
I don't wanna go to sleep, but the haters tryna make my bed
They can never tuck me in, no, this where the fun begins
Night cap, snapback, your dreams have now been high jacked

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
Cause I'm a daydreamer, a daydreamer
A daydreamer, daydreamer
And I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
'Til the morning, 'til the morning

[Verse 2]
Cause we got insomnia, I think it's time for me to
Light it up like Hanukkah, yeah, if you don't mind, let's get high
I'm feeling like I might not remember tonight
My mind is spacing, can't feel nothing but the bass hit
Go ape shit crazy do it king Kong in this motherfucker
UFO parked right outside, who tryna get abducted?
Keep it rolling making movies, we in post production
Nothing you can tell me, just another night on Elm Street

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
'Til the morning, 'til the morning
Cause I'm a daydreamer, a daydreamer
A daydreamer, daydreamer
And I don't wanna go to sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
'Til the morning, 'til the morning

[Outro]
I don't wanna go sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna go sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna go sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
I don't wanna go sleep, I don't wanna go to sleep
