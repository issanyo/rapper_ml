[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, I know you heard me when I came in
Feel the engine through the pavement
You already know the payment
When you see me in this place dog, I ain't complaining
All them bitches start parading
This liquor got me so courageous
This feeling going through my brain that ain't nobody that could touch me
Too contagious
I know where my lane is
Full speed fuck breaking
You better get out of my way
You got a problem we can solve it I'ma never be too famous
Big dreams I never get full nigga
Big chain like a pitbull nigga
I just came from Egypt on a camel
Back home know you miss me like I'm wearing camo
Ahh-ooh! (x3)

[Verse 2: Hardhead]
I know it's hard to deny it
I show up to the party uninvited
From the chauffeur to the pilot
With my team on the island we be motherfucking wildin'
G shit in my demeanor
Shoot like Haiti but run a base like Jeeter
Cool G sweaters in little Italy literally living life-l-life like I'm Don Cartagena
Feet up like the stock pile nigga
Big chain like a rottweiler nigga
I be on some shit that you can't buy
Riding in some shit that they say that I ain't buy
It's Batgang till the death ho
Anything else cut a cheque for
Laughing to the bank what you expect
4 B's big business in this bitch ain't nothing less ho
Prolly heard me all on the radio
And prolly seen me in the video
Bad bitches waiting every city yo
Hotel suite bullshit me and Shitty on
