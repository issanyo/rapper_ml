[Verse 1: P. Reign]
Deep breath while I'm thinking about my ex, I've been stressed
Don't deserve you but deserve to clear my chest, let me vent
Took me losing you from me to find myself, no regrets
Hit your line you hit decline
I get the message, you're upset
And you friends can't even pay for pay-per-view, not a set
But would pay to see us fight man the life the main event
They ain't stars nah, they ain't painting, they ain't kempt
'Needa cut them from your team, don't deserve to play the bench
Man my life was mess, you told me you love me
But when you're young and got money it's hard to stick to one woman
This ain't excuses, apologize more than a million times
This is just my explanation for all the night that you sit and cry
I know you do, don't say you don't
I need you back, don't say you gone
Called me a king so I when and got that tat on my neck
Still check my phone every hour praying your call or your text

[Hook:]
You say you're gone, no never looking back
You say you're gone, no never looking back
I say I'm on now, oh look at that
It's been too long now, I want you back
I want you, I want you
I want you back, I need you back
I want you, I want you
I want you back, I need you back

[Verse 2: P. Reign]
Still get them butterflies, not lie
Quiet, she wanna know why
Cause every time I see you my stomach knots like a bow tie
Four cheese rigatoni, she ordered and felt she owed me
I told her things changed, I'm ballin' I feel like Kobe
You got a husband nine years now, still looking lonely
Or just my mind playing tricks on me, praying you want me
You moved to Hollywood but finally came home for the holidays
We talked about the past and made me promise you I would never change
By being modest, humble, being honest
Cause you know I'm from a hood where they ain't raise no prima donnas
We're skipping classes just to sneak a kiss by the lockers
The only girl on my high school that wasn't caught up in gossip
I never gave up on you, but I'd be lying if I told you I was waiting on you
Still wishing we was back in the class
But let the past be the past
And pray the memories last

[Hook:]
You say you're gone, no never looking back
You say you're gone, no never looking back
I say I'm on now, oh look at that
It's been too long now, I want you back
I want you, I want you
I want you back, I need you back
I want you, I want you
I want you back, I need you back
