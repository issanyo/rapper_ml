Verse: I miss them December cloudy night, I miss them smiley nights

I miss them preme man you wild b night, I miss them

Head ass paragraphs that you used to love

And when i was your favorite person that you used to love

I hope I'm number 2, i will never ever wanna get rid of you

You my heart shorty, You mean the world shorty

And if I die I hope you paint my fucking world shorty, unh

I said some shit ive never said before, Summer time ruined us

Like i said before

And I always talked about the shit i wanted to do

The only reason i wanted to do it because it involved you

Like museums and picnics have all gone to waste

I rather a picnic when it snows or it rains

Cause summer basically ruins everything, I hope me and you

Can do this again

Hook:

Take me back to December 2x

I mean we met in December, those times where the best so take me back to December

Take me back to December, aye look

Baby girl you my November, aye

Just take me back to December those times where the best so take me back to December

Bridge 2x:

If you gotta take a break, take a break

Sometimes im a waste

I connect with you more than anything

I know i ruined it, you was finna go through with it

Get me on the right path so i won't make you blue again

If you gotta take a break, take a break

Sometimes im a waste

Connect with you more than anything

Baby girl you my whole boo

Imma do anything just for ah

Chorus again 2x

Verse 2:

I ain't really mad, im just really sad

Tryna get you back, you ain't even laugh

You just mean mugging talking bout the past

Please keep me focused I dont wanna crash

Me and you is great, take you out for steak

I got big bills spend em anyways

I got big guns shoot em in his face

I got big heat love you all the days

Chorus
