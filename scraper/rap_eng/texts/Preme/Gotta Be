[Intro]
Young Reign
Reps up boss nigga
You know what time it is


[Verse 1]
I'm still a king
Incase you forgot nigga
And this money still ain't a thing
Sellin work, you need a job nigga?
Call my nigga hyper
Shooters out in london
Bitch, my son swag
Even my daughter stuntin'
Young nigga hold your status like I'm 80 somethin'
Still don't trust women
Tell my lady nothin'
Don't tell me lies, now don't tell me lies
Cause you looking at the truth
Uh, club Kane in the booth
Pistols out the roof
I'm superman in the coupe
Never put bitches before your niggas
Never put money before your niggas
Cause together I bet it we gonna get it
You niggas sweet
And bitch I'm diabetic
I know gangsters make the world go round
And this rollie on my wrist will make your girl go down
I run my city, did 100 laps around the town
So much money in the room you gotta walk around


[Hook]
Ridin with the chrome, that's how its gotta be
Cause all these niggas want my throne, that's how its gotta be
I'm paranoid on my way home, that's how its gotta be
Cause all these feds watching my phone, that's how its gotta be
These niggas never show me love, that's how its gotta be
Got 20 bottles in the club, that's how its gotta be
I'll fuck them bitches on the rug, that's how its gotta be
A nigga still don't give a fuck, that's how its gotta be


[Verse 2]
Fuck undercovers, I'm fuckin cover girls
Hoes with no underwear, welcome to the underworld
Connected with mafia so my block is loco
We get the kilos on the d-low down from Acapulco
Gangsta and greedy, the money don't come easy
Fuck it, if there's a profit better come with it
Never needy, chasing money like it's Weezy
So many birds, we need the trucks fitted
Must have lost your watch
Bitch you out of time
Flatline if you out of line and it's bottom line
Our only care in this world of crime is the dollar sign
Shoot up the club like its 99' cause I fuck with Shyne

[Hook]
Ridin with the chrome, that's how its gotta be
Cause all these niggas want my throne, that's how its gotta be
I'm paranoid on my way home, that's how its gotta be
Cause all these feds watching my phone, that's how its gotta be
These niggas never show me love, that's how its gotta be
Got 20 bottles in the club, that's how its gotta be
I'll fuck them bitches on the rug, that's how its gotta be
A nigga still don't give a fuck, that's how its gotta be

[Verse 3]
Man, why mad niggas rap though
Fuck that, where the bad bitches at though
Kill the mice and get the cheese out the trap though
Kill the pussy might slide it in the back though
I'm just playin, fuck it, what I'm sayin
Fuck your shit up, my goons'll just buck
You dudes I don't trust, them hoes I don't love
She say "I'm bout to cumâ€”bout to cum", don't rush
[?] these motherfuckers
But I still hear my mama sayin baby don't cuss
These hoes said hold up, I told her to roll up
Grab the weed, grab the dick, go nuts
Bang bang with niggas that gangbang
Stay in your lane you rockin a no name
No chain, nigga, no chain
Ooooh, broke nigga no shame
Ooooh, go night night nigga
20 goons lookin like fright night nigga
20 chains lookin like a bright light nigga
Better fire your jeweler cause your ice look dimma'
Cole ass world, been a born ass sinna'
Wrist game lookin like a cold ass winter
Call my wolves, cause you look like dinner
Lights out, strike out, boy you ain't no hitter
