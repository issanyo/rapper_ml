(Verse 1)
Bad bitches but all the same
I bet one day they gon know my name
Reign, nothing short of a thunderstorm
Hustle soon as the sun is showing
Hustle soon as the sun is warm
Hard violence when it's young niggas with no guidance
Buying Louis we was fly but was no pilots
Graduated from the streets we ain't know college
First fight I said fuck it all I want is a pistol
I'm on the come up if you run up I'll blow like a tissue
Grab my light from the flame, influenced by the game
I earned my name from my aim Uh
Niggas never showed us love so we ain't show it back
Now me and my niggas run this game like a quarterback
I found something to share and I ain't holding back
We just out here stacking money nothing short of Shaq
Clean hammers wield shooters at the laundry mats
Now the worlds ours, I showed em that
I showed em that, I showed em that
Now they know the worlds is ours
I showed em that

(Hook)
I made winners out what they call losers
Took a dark past and built a bright future
They said some day you gon run the game
I said one day they gon know my name
Used to have the blues know I got green
I took nightmares and built dreams
I'm from the bottom and i'm not ashamed
Cuz one day they gon know my name

(Verse 2)
I know you hear me, the ice'll make you see me
But tell me do you feel anymore and gotta heal me
Streets is getting cold heart is getting chilly
Baby mamma imma back sorta like my city
New set of wheels the Range purr like a kitty cat
They wish they had the whip right outta genie lamp
New jewels my O.G.'s said I see you rookie
Over sized penny coaters, Mrs.Clause pussy
Whether fades or braids we all one in the same
You selling cane or shooting j's still playing the game
She contemplate so she should she stay the night
Cuz her friends ain't nothing but bad advice
Started from the bottom to building the tower
It takes more than an hour to gain positions of power
Started pitching to fiends hitting like Iron Mike
With two time felons dodging the third strike
From the city where Drizzy shine bright
I'm just saying and praying that lightning strikes twice
Keep the days we own the night
I want the rain you keep the light

(Hook)
I made winners out what they call losers
Took a dark past and built a bright future
They said some day you gon run the game
I said one day they gon know my name
Used to have the blues know I got green
I took nightmares and built dreams
I'm from the bottom and i'm not ashamed
Cuz one day they gon know my name
