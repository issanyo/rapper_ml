[Hook]
I shoulda told them other bitches fall back
'Cause all them other bitches wasn't all that
So every time you hang up Imma call back
Just to show you that you worth it
'Cause you deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it, you deserve it
(Too busy runnin' shit to run home)
(Too busy runnin' shit to run home)

[Verse 1]
Uh
You need a hand I'll lend you
Act like I don't care, I just can't pretend to
As far as dinner girl, your on the menu
Ooh, god bless you, sprung since the day I met you
Them other girls nothing special
We ride like we foot and pedal
I, I mean I met her, met her when life would stress her
Began applying some pressure in hopes that I find the treasure
I, I mean I met you, want your number and address
To undress you, you're a mess
Well here's a message, I'm a mess too
Ride till I can't regret you
Fuck till I can't forget it
Oppression with no discretion
Prescription pills on your dresser
I know it, I know I stress you
Your patience being measured
I spend paper to impress you
Overall it's been a pleasure

[Hook]
I should told them other bitches fall back
'Cause all them other bitches wasn't all that
So every time you hang up I'ma call back
Just to show you that you worth it
'Cause you deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it, you deserve it
(Too busy runnin' shit to run home)
(Too busy runnin' shit to run home)

[Verse 2]
Uh
Guts and glory, shawty, you know my story
From the city where it's hard to trust women, I'm always lonely
Say fuck me like you owe me, hold me like you stole me
You got all my exes feeling like they all deserve a sorry
That's power, knew you different from the minute
I asked you for a second, now watch this thing of hours
Hating's for the cowards
She would wait till I'm sober to say I'm with her
'Cause experience taught her never trust the words said under liquor
I respect her like my mother, protect her like my sisters
Put money before the bitches, but nothing before the missis
That's real, and in fact, real niggas pick up the slack
Just recently tatted my name down her spine 'cause I got her back
Yeah, my old bitches still texting me angry words
Just went and bought a iPad for all them angry birds
Word, and how you know she the one
When you offer her the world
But she wants nothing but love, that's real

[Hook]
I should told them other bitches fall back
'Cause all them other bitches wasn't all that
So every time you hang up I'ma call back
Just to show you that you worth it
'Cause you deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it, you deserve it
(Too busy runnin' shit to run home)
(Too busy runnin' shit to run home)

[Outro]
(I belong to you)
(I belong to you)
(I belong to you)
(I belong to you)
