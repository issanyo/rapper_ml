[P. Reign:]
Writing a song thought I would never make
Called you names thought I would never say
You were my angel, for Heaven's sakes
Now, we ended a bond that we thought we would never break
Real love: I meant it, but that real love starts with a friendship
And I'm sorry for the things that I mentioned
But in love and war, we seek vengeance
Tell me where did we go wrong: I guess we was never that right
I heard you trying to be a actress, but you ain't even got your act right
You said that maybe we should slow down, but I was caught up in the fast life
I'm just saying...

[Gotye:]
But you didn't have to cut me off;
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low:
Have your friends collect your records, and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know

[Gotye & P. Reign]
(Follow me; I'll hold you close, said "I'll never let you go.")
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know
(Grab your things; pack your clothes, and you're headed for the door.)
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know

[P. Reign:]
Good days turn to bad nights
We experimented, like lab mice
But green weed and pink sprite: turn to Advils over advice
I know, I'm partly to blame, but blame it on my love for the game
Now, I got a heart full of shame;
At the bar, taking shots for the pain
How'd you go from minute to brief
To feeling like you needed to leave?
Well, fucking started to feel like a chore to you
Or when sex started to feel like a bore to me
I admit it felt like we was holding on:
In the bedroom, weighing out pro's and con's
But it was our bed, and we made it
So if there is something to say, then just say it

[Kimbra:]
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way, reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Gotye:]
But you didn't have to cut me off;
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low:
Have your friends collect your records, and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now, you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody. (I used to know.)
Somebody. (Now, you're just somebody that I used to know.)
Somebody. (I used to know.)
Somebody. (Now, you're just somebody that I used to know.)
(I used to know...) (...that I used to know.) (I used to know.)
Somebody
