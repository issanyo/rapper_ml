[Verse 1]
Always been my own man, always stood on my own two
I was used to not havin' shit, now I do whatever I wanna do
Still down with my same niggas, I don't be with no new crew
We don't need no new friends, so don't come around if we don't know you
Don't ask me why I move different, cause you don't know what I've been through
Still walk around with two strippers, that never fuck with me gentle
Still ride for who's locked up, and pour a shot for who's gone
Still sendin' that commissary 'til all my niggas come home
I could never be rich and not look out for my squad
If you ain't never put us niggas on, don't call yourself no boss
I don't ever get snaked twice, had to cut a few niggas off
Been to Hell and back and started flippin' packs, now I'm the nigga on top

[Hook]
Told my niggas we need one more brick
Told my bitch we need one more drink
We'll be good if we hit one more lick
Then we woke up and we did that shit
And now we rich and now we rich, we rich
Now we rich and now we rich, we rich
Now we rich and now we rich, we rich
Now we rich and now we filthy rich
Now we rich and now we...

[Verse 2]
I don't ever fuck with broke niggas, I don't ever trust thots
I just ride around in my city with my top down, gettin' top
We don't ever need handouts, all my niggas sell rock
I don't ever hit the jewelry store unless a hundred bands and I cop
I don't ever fuck with fake niggas, I don't ever talk to cops
I don't ever hit the dealership and not drive shit off the lot
Heard the feds are still gunnin' for me, I'ma die 'fore I talk
Moved out the hood a long time ago but I'm still the man on my block
Ain't none of my niggas going for it, I ain't ever been robbed
Try to take my shit, I don't play that shit, so you niggas gon' get shot
I don't ever want one chief, I'ma need a whole lot
When she hit the pole and she drop it slow, I tell her back it up and don't stop

[Hook]
Told my niggas we need one more brick
Told my bitch we need one more drink
We'll be good if we hit one more lick
Then we woke up and we did that shit
And now we rich and now we rich, we rich
Now we rich and now we rich, we rich
Now we rich and now we rich, we rich
Now we rich and now we filthy rich
Now we rich and now we...
