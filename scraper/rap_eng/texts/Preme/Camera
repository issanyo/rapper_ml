Yeah, damn
How do I even start this?
Bout’ a female I vowed would never part with
Glancing at pictures we taking when we was lost kids
While picking up my final things in your apartment
Shit! It hurts, don't it?
I know it do
My homies said I'll find a better woman
I told them slim chance
But I hope it's true
She told me I took advantage
And that I took her for granted
Well if time heals all wounds
I hope [?] brought a bigger bandage
Yeah, if I could cry
I wouldn't wipe a tear
It's hard saying what you need to hear
But if you ever make my little man call another dad, i'll do 25 to life and won't regret a year
Guess just Us wasn't the plan for Us
But don’t say I wasn't man enough
Hustling hard, balling through the mall, they couldn't handle us
Now the only thing we got left is on your camera

Yeah, and I don't mean to make things worse
I’d be lying if I said it didn't hurt
But if all good things must end
Then this is goodbye my friend
They couldn't handle us
(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)
They couldn't handle us
(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)

Yeah, I fell in love the minute I met you
Thinkin' god must really have blessed you
Right from the beginning I started to stress you
Cause you said you had a man and I shouldn't accept you
I said “nah, I don't need anybody except you”
And I’ll do anything but regret you
That I would do everything to protect you
8 years later you say I neglect you
I wanted the world, you wanted your man
You tried to walk with a smile
But it's hard to pretend, all your childish ways made you hard to defend
Plus the shit you put on Twitter, the start of the end
Damn, where the fuck did we go wrong?
Why the fuck we ain't hold on?
At the start I said you so bad
Now it’s the end baby, so long
Last words, “I’m really hoping you [?]”
You said, “I hope you find the girl you’re looking for and I swear it”
I write with a broken heart and it shatters in every lyrics
Been trying hard to conceal it, but breakups will break your spirit

Yeah, and I don't mean to make things worse
I’d be lying if I said it didn't hurt
But if all good things must end
Then this is goodbye my friend
They couldn't handle us
(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)
They couldn't handle us
(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)

Yeah, and I don't mean to make things worse
I’d be lying if I said it didn't hurt
But if all good things must end
Then this is goodbye my friend

You know what? Fuck it
How could I play you?
I made you
Threatening to leave the one that saved you
I'm your dream that came true
Know what? Its cool
You always talk more than you listen
Besides, I bet a badder bitch'll be down to play your position
Who are you to judge?
Who made you the shit?
Who are you to quit?
Thought you was too legit?
Only two words come to mind
Fuckin' bitch
If that wasn't love
It don't exist
