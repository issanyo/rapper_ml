[Intro]
It takes centuries to make niggas like me
That's why you don't never see niggas like me
Young Reign

[verse 1]
Why you keep calling me fam, and we ain't fuckin related
Im not the nigga that sprays it im the one that okays it
Out in cali with Term and Capo with friends and in vegas
Yelling R.I.P Eazy hit my shades and my Raiders
I menage in the penthouse do no disturb i got company
My bitch keep on bugging me well then shaggy it wasn't me
Addicted to dollars 50 chains in my address
I walk in the jeweler another one like im khaled
Holding 40 cals doing 360's and 745's
Dont grab the wheel if you dont got the drive, you feel me
Daddy with a sense of pride
Got a boy im tryna guide
I just took my son to the park and taught him dont let shit slide

[Hook]
Damn right every night for i sleep by my bed on my knees
With my hands folded together
You dont grind you dont eat wanna shine you dont sleep my OG told me i remember
I have faith I believe got my egg wanna squeeze i can see that its now or never
Pray the real ones live forever
Pray the real niggas live forever

[verse 2]
My nigga twitch still hustlin
Dont touch the kid or he bustin
Cause the first thing that we learn to cook was a recipe for destruction
With some white girls out in london, all down to fuck no discussion
If the head good i make her knock knock on that headboard no concussion
Foreign on fire like a soto
We dont talk to the popo
Just bought a brick and drove OT singing im in love with the coco
Can't trust niggas real solo
Dont fuck with me no homo
No disrespect to my homies folk but i ain't going out like no hobo
Booth poppin like 20 models got them sparks coming in slow mo
Just alley oop them bitches like 20 bottles walked in the club like a show boat
Rarri styles and my nigga felly
Tell these hoes that we young and ready
And long range and my aim reggie im a lightweight but my waste heavy


[Hook]
Damn right every night for i sleep by my bed on my knees
With my hands folded together
You dont grind you dont eat wanna shine you dont sleep my OG told me i remember
I have faith I believe got my egg wanna squeeze i can see that its now or never
Pray the real ones live forever
Pray the real niggas live forever

[Outro]
Pac predicted his death. Naw
He just knew how he was living one day the system would get him lord please follow my steps
And may no nigga curse the god that god is blessed
