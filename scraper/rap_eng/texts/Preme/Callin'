[Intro: Preme]
Why don't you call on me, yeah, yeah
Call on me, yeah, yeah
You can lay it all on me (you can lay it all)
All on me, whoa
You hit me up and I'll be on my way (yeah, yeah)
Just show me love and I'll show you the same (ayy)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been callin', callin', callin' you, baby
I was checkin' in on my lil' baby
Used to pull up in that Mercedes
Friends used to hate, callin' me crazy
Talk your shit, just made fun of me, baby
You were stayin' down 'fore I got famous
Puttin' work in and I ain't never complainin'
Niggas hate but it ain't never gon' phase me
I been callin', callin', callin' you, baby
I was checkin' in on my lil' baby
Used to pull up in that Mercedes
Friends used to hate, callin' me crazy
Talk your shit, just made fun of me, baby
You were stayin' down 'fore I got famous
Puttin' work in and I ain't never complainin'
Niggas hate but it ain't never gon' phase me

[Verse 1: Preme]
I been searchin' for you, make way
These hoes searchin' for a payday
So I don't really hear the things that they say
'Cause I don't really trip unless it's vacay, yeah, yeah
Just close the door
We jump in the car with nowhere to go
Just us in the road
Pickin' new place on the globe
She never done this before, yeah
Hot girl with the boy from the corner
When I get it in your soul out
Neighbors is listenin' close now
And you just be screamin', "Oh slow down"
You got the world on your shoulders
So you hate bein' sober
You hate gettin' older
You so used to bein' a loner
I tell you, "I love you" you tell me to show you

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been callin', callin', callin' you, baby
I was checkin' in on my lil' baby
Used to pull up in that Mercedes
Friends used to hate, callin' me crazy
Talk your shit, just made fun of me, baby
You were stayin' down 'fore I got famous
Puttin' work in and I ain't never complainin'
Niggas hate but it ain't never gon' phase me
I been callin', callin', callin' you, baby
I was checkin' in on my lil' baby
Used to pull up in that Mercedes
Friends used to hate, callin' me crazy
Talk your shit, just made fun of me, baby
You were stayin' down 'fore I got famous
Puttin' work in and I ain't never complainin'
Niggas hate but it ain't never gon' phase me

[Verse 2: Preme]
No lie, 23 up on your back, you're so fly
Oh my, lookin' like it's gonna take us all night
All right, she said, "Boy you 'bout to get it on sight"
She my type, we join the mile high club on every damn flight, you damn right
They gon' ask you who you with?
Then they gon' tell you I ain't shit
Forget them girls, you know they fake
Your whole clique is counterfeit
And you been ridin' way too long
For a girl to stay, you wrong
And it's not a problem 'cause haters talkin', sound like my favorite song
I tell 'em keep it goin', yeah

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
I been callin', callin', callin' you, baby
I was checkin' in on my lil' baby
Used to pull up in that Mercedes
Friends used to hate, callin' me crazy
Talk your shit, just made fun of me, baby
You were stayin' down 'fore I got famous
Puttin' work in and I ain't never complainin'
Niggas hate but it ain't never gon' phase me
I been callin', callin', callin' you, baby
I was checkin' in on my lil' baby
Used to pull up in that Mercedes
Friends used to hate, callin' me crazy
Talk your shit, just made fun of me, baby
You were stayin' down 'fore I got famous
Puttin' work in and I ain't never complainin'
Niggas hate but it ain't never gon' phase me

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
You know you mine, you know you mine, you know you mine
You know you mine, you know you mine
You know you mine, you know you mine, you know you mine
You know you mine, you know you mine
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh

Got some things on my mind
When a real nigga call

For the real, yeah, yeah
