[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm gone doesn't mean that I don't love you, oh
And through this window I just wish that I could touch you, oh
And even though I'm goin' away
I'll be home one day
I'll be home one day
Know that I'll be home one day

[Verse 1]
Uh, reality overpowers the fiction
When we're talking, young killers missin' a pot to piss in
His palms itchin' with dreams of executin' his vision
On a mission, watch as he grips his Glock with conviction
Can you blame him? Can you blame him?
With his light straining face with the ultimate ultimatum
You either starve
Play the sideline and get involved
They urge you to get a job
You gave resumes, not a call
Anything for his kid
Never cared to be rich
The thought of consequences gets dismissed when eatin' chips
Bought that life for a murder, his momma left, he was six
Guess he a son of a gun and a son of a bitch
Homie said the smackin' gavel's like the smokin' barrel
But you can hardly blame a world that ain't hardly travel
Just know we brothers, only God can judge us
And with this music I'ma make the haters love us, that's real

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm gone doesn't mean that I don't love you, oh
And through this window I just wish that I could touch you, oh
And even though I'm goin' away
I'll be home one day
I'll be home one day
Know that I'll be home one day

[Verse 2]
Picture this
Ass, tits and hips
Nothin' less than thick
Mac all on her lips
Top down on the whip
Barely 25, in a newest ride and her momma ain't buy that shit
She tried high school and she quit
Hit the strip then learn to script
Met the dawg, that was it
Fell in love, had a kid
Average black ghetto male
Even broke I'm doin' bids
Last I heard servin' 25 to life
Shootin' over dice
Head crack, hunnid dollar game, said he shot him twice
Tissues for the woman with the bad ammunitions
What don't kill you gon' build you
Just buy the pistol, I feel you
Them perverts testing your patience
If you had options you quit
But gotta see that you think
Just watchin' tricks from this tricks
She put the pussy for rental
And a price on the dental
But if she knew her potential
That girl could be monumental
But can you blame her?
Damn, can you blame her?
All for her daughter she sells prized possessions to a stranger
Until the night he raped her
Fallowed her home
Pistol in her purse
Holdin' her own
Still haunted by the scent of his cologne
One in his dome, she call 911 and hang up the phone, shit
Will they believe me or you? You or me?
And cop a plea
Servin' 25 to life for 23
And for somethin' she ain't tryna be
They found the fingerprints and they believe a story
Gone for homicidal robbery, damn

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm gone doesn't mean that I don't love you, oh
And through this window I just wish that I could touch you, oh
And even though I'm goin' away
I'll be home one day
I'll be home one day
Know that I'll be home one day

[Bridge: Female vocals]
Away
I'll be home one day
I'll be home, home one day
I'll be home
I'll be home one day
I'll be home
I'll be home one day

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm gone doesn't mean that I don't love you, oh
And through this window I just wish that I could touch you, oh
And even though I'm goin' away
I'll be home one day
I'll be home one day
Know that I'll be home one day
