I been hustlin', musclin' like all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
I've been touchin' bricks and bustin' clips like all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
We don't pretend and make no friend, been like this all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
Niggas out here hibernatin' on me all my life
I put that on my life that they won't take my life
Oh, no, no ah no

My whole life been around lifers
I just meet weed down the wreckus
I swear you ain't met a nigga like this
Six figure nigga, no licence
My finger's on the keys, no typin'
Nigga still bitin', no Tyson
I'm still self made, no hyphenin'
And I still run shit, no heist, mate
Gettin' payed and I can't complain
Cope the yung niggas that I can't contain
Spot up on the corner with the rap day day
Call me young Ray, man that boy got game
Young real nigga neva duck
Man, all around the world been bustin'
Trust me, just got some thangs through customs
Time to celebrate, tell em bussin'
Fuck it, just got rich, can't explain that shit
Trust my ho, I don't claim that bitch
Just got a Benz and exchanged that shit
Make the world Transform, Power Range that shit
You ain't nigga, play that shit
Thousand dolla shoes, but you can't name that shit
For this slide home gotta hit that pitch
Cadillac sniper can't name that bitch

I been hustlin', musclin' like all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
I've been touchin' bricks and bustin' clips like all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
We don't pretend and make no friend, been like this all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
Niggas out here hibernatin' on me all my life
I put that on my life that they won't take my life
Oh, no, no ah no

Where you been at? You want a bread, then where you get that?
Niggas can't claim? Well, I been that
Gotta crown layn on the throne, why sit that?
Oh, I neva let them bitches play me (neva)
Bunch of grabbers stickin' Johnny crazy
And that cuss got her mouth pregnant
Well, congratulations, bitch, we bout to have a baby
Yeah, need a hitter, got 100 guys
From where the killers neva compromise
And all the haters shout out all their minds
But I'm still a kid, underline
Under the G code I admit that
Under the tree flow it's gift wrapped
Niggas snitchin', down-o with chit-chat
Only time I drop it down is when I give yo bitch back
Fuck up in front of me, you a enemy
Don't be a nigga dyin' cuz of Hennessy
Lemme finish my sentence before you sentence me
Fuck the judge, jury and the penitentiary
Uh, I'mma hit it and she wid it
I might kill it if she let me kill it
At least a quarter mill in a minute
Light skin, nigga, so I gotta tan it

I been hustlin', musclin' like all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
I've been touchin' bricks and bustin' clips like all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
We don't pretend and make no friend, been like this all my life
Yeah, all my life, yeah, all my life
Niggas out here hibernatin' on me all my life
I put that on my life that they won't take my life
Oh, no, no ah no
