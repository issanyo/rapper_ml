“Rap niggas who don't think much past figures are figurines
That you put in a cabinet for décor. You're listening
To the evolution of revolution—won't be televised
Won't be tweeted, either; won't even see it with naked eyes

I make it my number one priority. It's a war for the minds of the blind masses—
Owning their own masters

They think the sheep in the pasture are eating grass
So they leave 'em to eat and don't even ask if they need it. After believing
The propaganda, they properly propagate/copulate
And eat the same shit that they poppas ate
Then they populate the planet planning to live off Arm & Hammer
To manage or make a living, since when is there harm in handling business?

You know, the damage of living inside a fantasy comes after understanding
That nothing's gonna be handed to you

The greatest trick you can pull involves wool
And your eyes, and involves tying it tightly enough to blind you

[Hook]
Do what I tell you—search, and go find the Ledge
That I Know you don't know about, and then wait for what Simon Says

And since I know you can't see it, and you're kind of scared
Just down a few pills, pop 'em and wait till you're outta there

Now, I'm a dare you to do it, and it sounds stupid, but jump—
I promise you that it's fun and it's what you want

Your role models are doing it, why should you not?
Cop quick. What's life living outside a shoebox?

[Verse 2]:
So, we got no more MLKs, Malcolms or Tupacs

All we have are Michaels and Jordans...and a few shots

“It's all just a game, and we just the players
That wasn't us. That was Mike Dunn and Jordan Davis
Or Trayvon and Zimmerman.”

Play back. Listen again
Danger: Ignorance works like a carcinogen
Revving a car engine in park after it's started's not
Doing shit but making loud noise in the parking lot

We can walk it out for miles, march, demonstrate and protest
But it won't mean a goddamned thing. It's just gon' show next
Time the line can be moved farther and be more obvious
He said 50 years ago when the time for martyrs is

So this ain't radical—it ain't me starting shit
It's me saying, maybe cash in on your country's promises

Or wake up from that dream that you seem to be in
And take a hard look, for your kids, what you're 'bout to leave 'em

[Hook]
Do what I tell you—search, and go find the Ledge
That I Know you don't know about, and then wait for what Simon Says

Now, I'm a dare you to do it, and it sounds stupid, but jump—
I promise you that it's fun and it's what you want

Your role models are doing it, why should you not?
Cop quick. What's life living outside a shoebox?

[Verse 3: Louis Farrakhan]:
It’s time now for you to be delivered

America can’t hold you no more

She has no jobs for you

Her factories closing down—

All she has is a plan of death for you

And that’s why drugs are in the black community

That’s why guns are in the black community
You’re not shooting down your open enemy
You’re shooting each other down

But you’re going to pay a price

For killing your people

I’m gonna tell you the price in a minute
And then I’m through

But you will face EVERY word that you hear me say…”
