Flex, skrrt, skrrt, niggas ain't keepin' up (skrrt, skrrt)
Pullin' up with choppers and the windows up (brrp, brrp)
Get you knocked off with a arm up (ugh)
I do not be talkin', they gon' bomb rush (shush)
You not really poppin', get your crumbs up (crumbs up)
Yeah, we had to fall just to come up (fall)
Smokin' on cookie, smellin' like fungus (ooh)
Gettin' the pop, eatin' it like a nunchuck (beat it)
Real niggas, no fuck shit among us (real)
The bag's so big, got enourmous (bags)
Still three-deep on the tour bus (gang)
Race to the check, took a shortcut (ugh)
I got it, you hate it
No neighbors, my houses is gated
Your career deflated (pitiful)
This is not Mike, but I made it (I made it)
I'm from the north, not Decatur (north)
