Part 1: You Know

[Hook]
You know, you know, you know you got it like that
You know, you know, you know you got it like that
But you be acting so rude, and I be acting so cool
But you know, you know, you know you got it like that

[Verse 1]
Like every time that sun shines baby
Don't I be on your mind baby?
If you searching then you will find baby
Just gotta open up your eyes baby
Even on my darkest day I know she never shady
Yeah, she let me taste, I say it's all gravy
That body slim, you must be related to Baby
Can't seem to find my way out, that pussy amaze me
No make-up needed, young Halle in the making
The closest thing to perfection has been seeing you naked
Winning like I got a pair of aces
That booty keep me drooling like I got a pair of braces
She fuck me like I'm famous
Told her one day I'ma make it
She said "I'm still gon' be here even when the fame has faded"
And she my lady so I keep her in the latest
And just because I'm proud to say I love her, they gon' hate us
I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I've been around the block enough to know when to stop and stare
Window shopped enough to know when to cop, that's rare
I never share, fuck 'em, he never care
I got her under my spell when I'm under her underwear
Said she never had a G, I bought a ring and told her "freeze"
The woman of my dreams, cause she deadly on her knees
I know that you're the one just cause you're all I ever need
And I love to see you come, but I hate to see you leave
You know the type of girl that make the guilty cop a plea
Ask around I'm hard to beat, drop my stick and part the sea
Biggest players cop a ring and drop a knee, stop and see
I'm on top of the world when you on top of me, balcony
Mine is yours and yours is mine and I'm too real across the line
Plus the bank is big enough to buy you anything but time
I was blind 'til I found the definition of a dime
It's funny how we met when I was waiting on a sign
Thank God

[Hook]

Part 2: It's You

Is this a dream?
She's like the cover of a magazine
Hard to breathe when you're on your knees
Lips like a love drug and I'm a fiend
Legally addictive, nicotine
Body tan like the Philippines
And I don't wanna make a scene
But I just need to make her scream
Mean I just need to make her see
That I just want to set her free
I mean if she spend the night with me
I'll be guilty of murder, baby I'll take a plea
I know I've been drinkin', admit I've been smokin'
I'm probably overthinkin', but I know what I want
And that's you, that's you, that's you
And that's you, that's you, that's you, oh that's you
I know what I want, that's you
I know what I want, that's you
I know what I want, that's you
I know what I want, that's you
