Its the same things that we go through
Im trying to show you
When you grow up in the hood
Wanna make it gotta be strong tryna hold on
When you grow up in the hood

When you grow up(in the hood)
When you grow up(in the hood)
When you grow up(in the hood)

When you grow up in the hood

When you grow up(in the hood)
When you grow up(in the hood)
When you grow up(in the hood)

When you grow up in the hoood..

Its the same place we try to move from
But if your real you never forgett where you come from
We had to hustle from sun up to no sun
And our only job was to get the job done (job done)
As far as mamas go they kept us breathng
Cause most of us ain't neva had fathers we belived in
And that church it was ther for one reason
We all begged to god and its the best place to meet him
The feds ain't neva help us and we ain't neva need em
They never seen potential so we only seen the presinct
Take me out the hood but the hood will never leave him
The only thing that change was the season belive me

Its the same thing that we go trough
Im tryna show you when you grow up in the hood
Wanna make it gotta be stong try to hold on
When you grow up in the hood

When you grow up( in the hood)
When you grow up (in the hood)
When you grow up (in the hood)

When you grow up in the hood

When you grow up( in the hood)
When you grow up (in the hood)
When you grow up (in the hood)

When you grow up in the hood

Yeaaa ilove my hood and ima ride for em
Thought me how to live so like big im ready to die for em
My baby boys like me so im trying show him
While he growing get knocked down you gotta keep going
I said its cool if you break a few rules
Just beat the odds gotta win cause they expect you to lose
Education is a tool but it dont make you a fool (nah)
Became millionaires that ain't graduate school
I seend it I dreamed it hoped that I would be it
Cause our mamas told us one day wel make it if we belived it
We used to steal bikes just so we could pop a wheele
Brand new 20s on the b.m like thats reign when they see me
I got everything I wanted from the hood strait to our tv
I got more than 3 wishes and I never met a genie
Paraplegic people they will never feel me(neva)
I call them niggas stevie cause they will never see me

Its the same thing that we go trough
Im tryna show you when you grow up in the hood
Wanna make it gotta be stong try to hold on
When you grow up in the hood

We grew up to early worried bout survivel
The dealers had the money so the dope boyz where our idols
Living in the projects theres always something to do
How do we stay out of trouble we stuggle is all we do
We all had dreams and stories to tell friends that past away
Or family in the jails the sky is the limit had to learn to grow wings and I ain't gotta say it listen to the hook sing

Its the same thing that we go trough
Im tryna show you when you grow up in the hood
Wanna make it gotta be stong try to hold on
When you grow up in the hood

When you grow up( in the hood)
When you grow up (in the hood)
When you grow up (in the hood)

When you grow up in the hood

When you grow up( in the hood)
When you grow up (in the hood)
When you grow up (in the hood)

When you grow up in the hood.....
