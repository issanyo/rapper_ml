[Verse 1]
I'm on a wave, I've been smokin', nigga, I've been drinkin' daily
I just landed on the West side, holla if you hear me
Tell 'em don't get near me, the clique is gettin' seri
I been rollin' with the niggas with no licences since the Carry
My bae from the Bay, told me she don't wanna share me
Well get up, and pack your shit and make it quick, I'm in a hurry
The more the merry, never ordinary
Heard you're making moves, I'm out here making movies, bitch, I'm Tyler Perry
I'm tryna ping a ting, hit me on the Berry
Made my first milli yeah, I had to pop my cherry
The fuck they gonna tell me?
Lookin' like I walked up in the bank and then they tell it to me
"Take what you can carry"
Young and legendary, young visionary
Killin' everythin', fillin' cemeteries
Roll with shottas, tell 'em bulletproof the Bentleys
Yeah, I'm from the wave, nothin' friendly, nigga

[Hook]
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
See me out here puttin' on like everyday
See me surfin' through the city on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
See me out here puttin' on like everyday
You see me surfin' through the city on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
Well, tell that bitch when you see me, better wave
Niggas surfing through the city on a wave

[Verse 2]
Sold out shows with the show off
They done put a nigga on I'm about to throw off
Yeah we heard your shit, singin' shit, then we dosed off
'less it's money on the line we ain't taking no calls
Niggas puttin' money on my head like a mohawk
Stole my lil nigga bread now we down to toast ya'll
With the winners nigga, I ain't taking no loss
And when niggas raised the bar, let 'em poll vault
I ain't no loco joker, we run a train on her
We holla choo choo, yeah choo choo she a locomotive
I got that new new that new new I'mma meet the quota
Niggas sleepin' on me, cool? your bitch is sleeping over
Seldom see me sober, I just crossed the border
Don't get out of order or I give the order
Found me on the corner sellin' coke and whippin' soda
And she just wanna blow a nigga that's about to blow up

[Hook]
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
See me out here puttin' on like everyday
See me surfin' through the city on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
See me out here puttin' on like everyday
You see me surfin' through the city on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave, I'm on a wave
Well, tell that bitch when you see me, better wave
