[Verse 1]
Uh, hottest women on speed dial
Young killas on redial
Came from my lawyer’s son’s bah mitzvah
In other words we don’t see trial
Young Reign from the streets now
It’s my turn to eat now
It’s time I turn up the heat now
In the studio, giving beats beat downs
All my young boys drink henny straight
My fans want Dear America, don’t let ‘em wait
I do better with the hate, anyway
Got the milli bout to be in my account, anyday
I been stuck in the city too long, can’t leave
Will you please come and get your bitch, can’t breathe
Roll up my sleeve, cook up the rock
Momma said you still got your hands in the pot
Man I be lying if I said I wasn’t waiting on this shit my whole life
Took a chance rolled the dice
Felt the pressure blowing pipes, not a drip, nigga not a drip
Boy I’m a plumber with this shit
Just got a new whip
My son call it "Tonka truck"
I said yea boy, your daddy in a big toy
Put your money on retainer before you’re outta luck
Got the feds on my ass, call ‘em hemorrhoids
Tell the pigs, that they better bring back up
I done sold an 8-ball on every corner
Wit the sticks on me, had to rack up
Showed no love to the niggas hatin’ on us
Hurry up young Reign they been waitin on ya
Its our time now im bout to lay it on ya
My bitch on twitter writing LOL
Still laughing at the broke bitches hatin on her

[Hook]
I been down this road
Grinding to the bone
Only way I know
Only way I know
I been on the low
Bubblin’ on the stove
Hustlin 'til I go
Only way I know
Where you been
Where you been
Man I been on the go
Only way I know
Where you been
Where you been
Man I been on the go
Only way I know

[Verse 2]
Ooh, young Reign in the flesh
Bitch, I been everything bet stressed
Big lie, you a god damn fibber
Can’t cross the border, just another fuckin nigga
Man, I been on the block with my motherfuckin niggas
Smoking weed, selling drugs, fuckin bitches, spilling liquor
Ooh, wylin’ out, I had to learn to hold my liquor
Im the boss, I ain’t got to pull the trigger
All the real d-boys, where you at
Teach how to cook a bird in like 6 minutes flat
Man, I’m just trynna make it where the rich niggas at
Tell ‘em skinny hoes bounce and bring the thick bitches back
Like her booty like my pockets gotta keep ‘em fat
Shout them H-town bitches with the dimples in they ass
Hoppin' up and down the courts, give and go
Me and my lawyer like the [?] here we go
Gotta bunch of killers with me, gotta problem let me know
Red dot got it pointed at your crown, watch the throne
That’s my dog throw a bone
You could smell the gunpowder, niggas sprayin' like cologne
And you know I got a team but I could do it my own
All alone, fuckin life boy, im David throwing stones
Order hits but never do it on the phone
Im the shit she can smell me through the phone
Bad bitch knocking at my door knock knock mhm
Imma fuck her on the floow bop bop mhm
And to them niggas talking non-stop
Watch this top drop, Glock pop (pop pop pop )
Where I’m from I’m a legend
Damn, that’s your girl, when the wedding
I have your bitch shotgun, riding through the 6, in a muthafuckin 7
Holla at me

[Hook]
I been down this road
Grinding to the bone

Hustlin 'til I go
Only way I know
Where you been
Where you been
Man I been on the go
Only way I know
Where you been
Where you been
Man I been on the go
Only way I know
