[Chorus]
That my hoe, so she gon' fuck
That my dog, so he gon' buck
And fuck them niggas, ain't got no trust
And fuck them bitches, ain't got no love
That my hoe, so she gon' fuck
That my dog, so he gon' buck
And fuck them niggas, ain't got no trust
And fuck them bitches, ain't got no love

[Verse 1]
No defeat, no retreat
You touch my C's, I'll cut your whole family tree
And we gon' eat, it's a feast
Tan coat like you landed on a beach
Cold blooded, you the coldest when you speak
This the diamonds on my teeth, I can whisper and she freaks
And ??? to me in hell, I landed on my feet
Balenciaga sneaks, if it's beef, we ain't gon' tweet
Ain't no peace, if you feeling froggy, leap
We keep the streets sweeped, only serve to make 'em lean
She said I taste like candy, I trick for treats
We been fuckin' 7 days, she got me weak
First time I fell in love was with a fiend
'Cause I was seventeen first time I made some green
Freedom of speech 'til you niggas mention Preme
Then it’s 9's to your back, puttin’ jerseys on your team
Bow bow, ay

[Chorus]
That my hoe, so she gon' fuck
That my dog, so he gon' buck
And fuck them niggas, ain't got no trust
And fuck them bitches, ain't got no love
That my hoe, so she gon' fuck
That my dog, so he gon' buck
And fuck them niggas, ain't got no trust
And fuck them bitches, ain't got no love

[Verse 2]
No defeat, no retreat
You lay a finger on my keys and get deleted
Everybody vegan now, don't want no beef
Looking like a hundred bricks a week, shout out Meech
You niggas got a problem with the kid, then come and see me
Man, fuck that nigga, he a weenie
'Member no cable, fixing antennas on the TV
I ain't hungry, boy, I'm greedy
Save my bullets, give 'em beating
Wore all my chains at once, too much, got a hunch
Know the back reign, boy, you fumble and you lunch
And can't no change change us, if there ain't no money, hang up
She brought a friend to play D, I hit that 3 and laid up
I'm drinking Henny with a twist, that my shit
Heard y'all just got married, congrats, that's still my bitch
Heard y'all bought a crib, congrats, that's on my wrist
Way she sucking dick gon' make a nigga tat her lips

[Chorus]
That my hoe, so she gon' fuck
That my dog, so he gon' buck
And fuck them niggas, ain't got no trust
And fuck them bitches, ain't got no love
That my hoe, so she gon' fuck
That my dog, so he gon' buck
And fuck them niggas, ain't got no trust
And fuck them bitches, ain't got no love
