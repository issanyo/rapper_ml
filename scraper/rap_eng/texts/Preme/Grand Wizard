[Hook]
I’m the leader of my Klan, got that cannon on my waist
Run up in a nigga yard, slap that burner ‘cross his face
If you see me, I ain’t playin’, got my finger on the trigger
Throw my hood up in the sky while I be killin’ all you niggas, like I’m
[[[Grand Wizard]]]
If you see me, I ain’t playin’, I be killin’ all you niggas, you can call me
[[[Grand Wizard]]]

[Verse 1]
Look, I tell a nigga like this
“Now you ain’t about to be livin’ all up in my neighborhood
Where I made it good.” And my way to put
This into effect is to slay the ‘hood
See, I made the ‘hood
Niggas be talkin’ ‘bout havin’ the ‘hood on they back—
I got the hood on my face
Get put in yo’ place
So, try to step up, get a foot in yo’ face

Get retired. Have another march from Cease Fire
Better have the church bring three choirs
We bring fire when we ridin’

You see violence…

‘Cause we hate y’all niggas

So just be silent…

We gon’ break y’all niggas

So, who in the fuck got the guts
To wanna come up and get cut
Down by the sounds of the rounds on the ground
In the midst of the crowd
I delivered it proud
You want it, you livin’ it now

Not you—yo’ blinds closed, yo’ eyes closed
Yo’ mind knows yo’ rivals wear my clothes
And you celebrate while I elevate
And I escalate the crime rate

Y’all sit and wait, so I’m great

So run and hide when I come
Or watch me fire my gun

And either way I don’t care
But I guarantee you I’m there

And niggas neva’ gon’ tell
So I’m neva’ seein’ no jail

[[[BANG!]]]

[Verse 2]

[What Scrappy say? O-K-K-K!]]]

If a nigga wanna play, I’m a drop that nigga
Me and the whole hood in the drop with the top back
With the Glock strapped, if I cock that, nigga
It’ll leave top flat, better stop that, nigga

Three K’s, ready to chop that nigga
If I catch you on the block believe it, I’m a cock the nina
[Pop, Pop] try’n’ a stop ya breathing
Have ya’ niggas tryna stop the bleeding
They cannot believe it

No bulletproof vest can protect you, my bullets go through to ya chest

We used to have fun killin’ niggas, but y’all niggas do it the best

Y’all doing it better than me and my crew could have ever imagined

We’ll never forget it. Me and my crew are forever indebted
Puttin’ our hood on, we cliqued up—rowdy, flexin’ that horsepower
More niggas, that’s more dyin’, more funerals, more flowers

Y’all kill, no big deal, but when we kill, ‘you poor cowards.’
It’s news coverage, Jesse Jackson, protesting ‘bout four hours

I’m seeing you as the enemy, nigga
You seeing you as the enemy, nigga
Load up the shotty
Makin’ you niggas take shots, I ain’t talkin’ bout Hennessey, nigga
Ruin ya plans, me and my Klan’ll make you and ya’ family a memory, nigga
It’s off with ya’ head, you better off dead, and that’s what you fin’n’a be, nigga

[Verse 3]
I believe there was a point in time where
America was afraid that the black man would rape his ladies
And they’d have his babies
So something, maybe, needed to be done to stop the madness

And sadness at some point gave way to apathy
Because the fact is
We are so much better at stopping us than anyone
In the history of America has ever been

And rather than see this as fact
We’d shackle ourselves to the lie that tells us that
The whips and the chains and
The murders with burners and
Crosses with crucifixes
Show who the sickness is inflictin’ as we flick on and pick off one another like
Cotton ready for the reapin’
Seekin’ approval from a master who may as well be our God

And since we can’t see the God in our selves
We try hard to show how Hell and Hard Times have broken our spirits, and
Each and every one of our lyrics is a testament to rest of it being just a matter of time…

I’ve never been to a Klan rally
But I’ve seen a man stand in an alley
Fire red hot lead shots at a man who was a spittin’ image of himself

And then take a piss in front of God and the whole world
Assured nobody would question his authority to take what he doesn’t own

Noose Necked Niggas may as well be Grand Wizards of the KKK…
[[[Grand Wizard]]]
If you see me, I ain’t playin’, I be killin’ all you niggas, you can call me

…Who would have thought that if we stayed in the ‘hood, the hoods wouldn’t have to come looking for us, and we’d just continue lynching ourselves?
