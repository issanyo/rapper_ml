[Verse 1]
You more than perfect
Wanna touch you slowly does it make you nervous
Let my fingers work it
ThereÂ´s so much more I wanna know about you
Really scratch the surface
Your heart's not for purchase
So the exes worthless
[?] no purpose
Let me close the curtains
Get that ass hurtin'
[?]
Till it's bright and early
[?]
I'm riding dirty
It's your 30-30
And you only wish is that i prove them worthy

[Pre-Hook]
And all you got is special
Say from god's special
Oh that pussy is special
You know that already
What we got is special
Work of [?]
And true that pussy special
You know that already

[Hook]
You know already
And you know, and you know
And you know that you are
And you know
You know that already
And you know, and you know
And you know that you are
And you know
You know that already

[Verse 2]
I've been thinking different
I'm not ashamed about about it
I was switching bitches
I was so consistent
And it's nothing like you
There's just something 'bout you
I can tell the difference
I told all my niggas
I showed all my niggas, that I found a winner

Truth is lady, these streets don't love us
But oh oh baby [?] stunna

I'm well connected
So you are protected
You know I respect it
That you and I met
[??]

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

[Outro x2]
Special, so special
So special, special
