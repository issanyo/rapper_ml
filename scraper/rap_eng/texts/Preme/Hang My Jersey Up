Keshia, know i got you right
Ain't you ready baby

Them other birds, drove me coo coo
And i see you in the street tryna' do you
Tell em' i put my spell on you, voodoo
Yeah, and if you really tryna' do me
Then hang it up like jordan, 2-3
Now i got your little friends like, "who is he"

I pick you, you roll with me
I just wanna be the coach you can lean on
'cause baby i'm the king, lebron
First pick when you enter the draft
Got a ring on you finger much bigger than shaq
She got a jersey on the wall with my name on the back
And on the defense, back board when i make an attack
