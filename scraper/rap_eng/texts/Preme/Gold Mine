[Hook: Daniel Daley]
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
I can double up in no time
You ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
And fuck a nigga co-sign
Imma get it on my own, all my gold mine

[Bridge: Daniel Daley]
I can pull up on that bitch that you like
No she like me much better
Do what I want, anyday anytime
Once a life with no pleasure
I can pull up on that bitch that you like
No she like me much better
That's all you need to know
All you need to know

[Hook]
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
I can double up in no time
You ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
And fuck a nigga co-sign
Imma get it on my own, all my gold mine

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
Ah, rolling swishers, scrolling naked pictures
Car service cracked a windows catch 'em blowing kisses
Niggas drowning, we don't feed the fishes
Grilling when they see P like they hate the Clippers
I'm never going back to jail ain't got no bigger wishes
Still not gon' walk like i'm superstitious
Mercedes Brabus, 850, the new addition
And the wheel still spinning like its new edition
Borrowed a quarter, paid it back in a year
Sit your ass in the rear, I see a king in the mirror
Crown lean to the side, from where the villains reside
Suck my teeth in the street, then learned to swallow my pride
I ain’t right at the top, but I’m right on the rise
I've see titans collide, I was fucking inspired
In the hoods trying to be good, get out or die
Just went and blew a mil for a crib in the sky that's way up

[Hook]
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
I can double up in no time
You ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
And fuck a nigga co-sign
Imma get it on my own, all my gold mine

[Verse 2: P. Reign]
Bought a Benzes to whip it, bought a hoe to kick it
Bought a stripper to tip it, and did it all with my niggas
Did it all for the city, with my town on my fitted
You got a Civic that's kitted, talkin' you ballin–pathetic
My nigga what are we talking
If it ain't about winnin'
If it ain't about women, 38 in my [linen]
Lord I've been mobbin forgive me
I prayed this semi protect me
Went to church for confession
And blamed it all on a Henny
I was homeless, gorilla mode, beat my chest
You on the menu time to meet the chef
Can’t stop to celebrate, there's more to make
Smoking loud, my niggas smell like a noise complaint
Higher pier, like a bright idea
Fuck them nosey hoes prefer to keep my sinus clear
Selling pies, I’m a pioneer
Bring your budget, I got you covered like riot gear, yeah

[Hook]
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
I can double up in no time
You ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
And fuck a nigga co-sign
Imma get it on my own, all my gold mine

[Outro: Daniel Daley]
I'm trying to make a 100 grand
And do it 10 more times
I can double up in no time
You ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my
Fuck a nigga co-sign
All my gold mine, gold mine
You ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my
All my gold mine, gold mine
Fuck a nigga co-sign
All my gold mine
