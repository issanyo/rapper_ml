[Intro:]
A girl's first time is very important
It determines the rest of her life, sexually
I read that oncein  one of my sister's magazines
Girlfriends told me that they hated their first experience
That's because they didn't love the guys

[Hook:]
I would never lie to you, I never lie to you
Say that I ride for you, then Imma ride for you
You ain't shit to me, why would I lie to you?
These people lost the truth, that's what I'm giving to you

[Verse 1: J.K. The Reaper]
Flow like a lotus and smooth with the pen
Swiper no swiping, one down with the sense
She riding with death at the tip of her lips
Liquid xanax at the tip of my pen
Got you niggas so sleep that why I ain't big
(Love someone else?)
(No. I mean..)
Fuck. I'm an insomniac
These labels are laundry mats
Need a gun or I die out here
And no tissue to cry out here
Only beds for niggas that lie out here
And I love it here
Pull an uzi out the mother ship
On some other shit
If you knew me you could suck a dick
I'm no prototype, I'm a great white shark
And you guppies can never swim
English isn't the only language bitch, I just speak it well
How you claimin' you a god if God would never claim flesh
I don't need this fucking skin because I'll still exist in death
Fuck the common wealth, I'm sitting here by myself
And I swear

[Hook:]
I would never lie to you, I never lie to you
Say that I ride for you, then Imma ride for you
You ain't shit to me, why would I lie to you?
These people lost the truth, that's what I'm giving to you

[Verse 2: J.K. The Reaper]
