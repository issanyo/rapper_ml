Them bitches hate to see you riding shotgun, yeah
Only worried 'bout your life 'cause they ain't got one, yeah
Smoking gas, pass that blunt, I'm on my last

They can't catch me, coupe don't got no backseat
You a bad bitch
Quit acting, girl, I know you acting
I dropped a 'hunnid up on a watch, it's a fortune
Try to reach for my watch and my chain, no questions, we torture
You say all your niggas gang bang, we on the same thang
Said they want the old Reign, niggas, things change
