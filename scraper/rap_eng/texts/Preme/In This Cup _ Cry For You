[Part I: In This Cup]

[Hook: P Reign]
How did I get here?
I should be home by now
Each time you pull me back
You seem to pull me down
What the fuck is in this cup?
How did I drink so much?
I can't remember a thing
Tell me how's been your man?
Baby where are you from?
What the fuck is in this cup?

[Verse 1: P Reign]
I blame her body'
Who she's been tanning four months, she's a fucking hottie
We got a couple dozen bitches, waiting in the lobby
And half my niggas on the run, but it's still a party
Go head, go head, show up, pour up
Roll up, blow up, light up
And I bet I fuck the night away
Before you fuck our night up
And I'm sorry if the sparkles on them bottles don't excite us
But we been getting money before OJ picked that knife up
Just shot a baby, don't chase it
If you was were I'm at, you'd be wasted
Just met a white girl that looked Asian
And I'm gonna fuck her till she speak Haisian
Been up all night with this cognac
No sleep, Insomniac
Let me put this dick where your thong be at
And go spin cycle, laundry mat
Just me, her, and them sheets
'Til that pussys' deceased
Got dimples in her cheeks
If she's a beauty, I'm a beast
Solo, might forget your name by the morning
Don't be mad at me
Time for that pretty face to come and face reality

[Hook]

[Verse 2: P Reign]
I blame it on the vodka
Well go on fill my cup up
Say she got a daughter
Well I'm such a motherfucker
I got two hoes that been calling
And two hoes in my lobby
I said who ever make it to the room first gon' get boddied
I'm a bad boy, bad boy
I hit that bitch 'til she in tears nigga, sad story
I hit that raw without a care nigga, call Maury
She gave me head right on her knees, she must've fell for me
(Ha, wassup)Just grab that lipstick out 'cha purse look at that ass in heels
Go on and flaunt that deadly weapon it's licensed to kill
We smoke and talk I say "What's up with you?"
She said her exes hate me, well shit what else is new?
I never run from the truth, baby I barely deny
She had her heart broken so many times she barely could cry
I say "Don't let them steal your heart, never forget how to try
Sometimes you just gotta' thank the Lord you found a good in goodbye,"

[Hook]

[Part II: Cry for You]

[Verse 1: P Reign]
Back then she ain't want me
But look at now, I'm blowing up
Thought I knew it'd all end
Guess I ain't really know enough
Remember I hit it, when  she ain't call back
Well, guess the ho wasn't all that
You really made a nigga fall flat
(uh)So I figured I should fall back
(Yeah)Them hoes ain't winnin'
Matter of fact, them hoes ain't women
Only the good girls get a man on one knee
To give them the whole world, these hoes don't get it
I got one heart, but I said let's split it
But she broke that heart, please don't kill it
Never let a good thing go, cause when a good thing's gone
All the other good things go with it
Yeah when the tables turn, like you renovating
Hope you feel the burn, like you in bed with Satan
Got lots to learn, it takes lots of patience
You taking turns, like it's an occupation
God damn, oh well
Keep a few bad hoes in the hotel
Learned a life lesson that I know won't fail
Never tell hoes, cause you know them hoes tell
Man, ain't it tough?
I guess just being light skin ain't enough
That's why all the good girls like to get it rough
And word around town is some girls wanna' fuck
Well get ready for the ride baby girl buckle up
But I want more then that
So she texting me, and I ain't calling back
And she acting like she bout to have a heart attack
But she lucky that even left her heart intact
