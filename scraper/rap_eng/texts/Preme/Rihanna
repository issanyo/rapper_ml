[Chorus:]
I gotta live every day like ,every day like this
I got that Rihanna [x2]
Yea man I got dat game right
I got that Rihanna [x2]
Man no other nigga know this

[Verse 1:]
Yo where ma shottaz dem, move where ma shottaz dem
Presidential rolling bitch! Shout out Barack an dem
Gunners from the start, no heart, we d hollow men
Killers turnin snitches, straight bitches we don’t follow dem
Get rich wit ma partna dem, ma Gucci shouldn’t bodda dem
Copped d milli stand tall in ma city I’m a monument
Do dis for ma mama dem, we drizzy on d jet
An d pilot dem, walkin down d runway like we modelin
Set up like we rastas, rollin up d ganja
Hit her in her mouth before I hit her inlata
My connect like Corleone smokin cubans in cabanas
In Guyana smokin birds, making millions with a bonus

[Chorus:]
I gotta live every day like ,every day like this
It’s d shoot outs in the daylight
Nah ma crew don’t itch
I got that Rihanna [x2]
My mama got ma head right
I got that Rihanna [x2]
Back down, meta nigga don’t miss

[Verse 2:]
D way I’m livin mama said “you're catchin off a case, gun not safe”
We ain't never play it safe
Heard dem niggas plot, tryna take a nigga's spot
I put that beam on your team, an connect d dots
Couldn’t see me dem niggas could neva be me
They gon’ need a paster, a prayer an a fuckin genie
More fire,more hallows
Champagne, go bottles!
Mention me and Morse follow, ring! (ring, ring, ring)

[Chorus:]
I got that Rihanna [x2]
My mama got ma head right
I got that Rihanna [x2]
Back down, meta nigga don’t miss
