[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Niggas know
Stuck on stacks
Real niggas know
Stuck on stacks
See y'all niggas
Stuck on
Stuck on
You don't have to understand me
Stuck on stacks
Stuck on stacks

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
Look outside, I'm pullin' up
It's goin' down, we goin' up (way up)
I need a girl that knows what's up
I close the deal, she open up
Need a bad bitch to throw it up
Only bad bitches roll with us
All the bad bitches show me love
But she told me that she is the one
Girl you need a face like RiRi
If you wanna be my rider
Girl you need an ass so Kimmy
If you want a bank like Tyra
Gon' head and let the nigga praise you
Long as the nigga pays you
Them jealous bitches hate you (they don't love you)
They said the money changed you, no, no, no
Tell 'em don't act like that
Tell 'em don't act like that, no, no, no
Tell them bitches, "Pardon my ride"
They ain't got no ass like that, no, no, no
When you move that thing it's beautiful
Thinkin' 'bout the things I do to you
Killin' all them girls, as usual
Time to book these hoes a funeral

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
But you need an ass like Nicki
And you need a face like Tyra
Dancin' in that brand new Vicky
Say you need that cash tomorrow
You tripping, you the shit right now, yeah
I heard workin' on some shit right now

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You only give a fuck 'bout stacks
Stuck on stacks, stuck on stacks
Stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks
Stacks on stacks on stacks
Stuck on stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks
Stuck on stacks, stuck on
Stuck on stacks

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I just get rich, get rich, get rich, get rich, get rich
I took a risk, she took a risk and now we rich
Might lick her lips and now your bitch became her bitch
Might hit the stripper club, a nigga hit a lick
I'm from the six so you know I got loans on loans
I hold that city so you know I got homes on homes
She love to use me for motivation
I give her beats and teach her, all in rotation
And she know I put that Prada on her back
Put that new designer on her side
Got her in Giuseppe
Put that dollar in her eye
She wanna get rich and famous
She wanna get rich and famous
She wanna get rich and change
So she can change that last name

[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
But you need an ass like Nicki
And you need a face like Tyra
Dancin' in that brand new Vicky
Say you need that cash tomorrow
You tripping, you the shit right now, yeah
I heard you workin' on some shit right now

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You only give a fuck 'bout stacks
Stuck on stacks, stuck on stacks
Stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks
Stacks on stacks on stacks
Stuck on stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks
Stuck on stacks, stuck on
Stuck on stacks

[Bridge: P. Reign]
You know, seen it, we done it all
I know you want it all, I know you want it all
I'm who you do it for
Round up a hundred more, count up a hundred more
Watchin' that money fall
You know to pick up as soon as that money call
I love my bitch cause you
Love my bitch cause you

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
You only give a fuck 'bout stacks
Stuck on stacks, stuck on stacks
Stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks
Stacks on stacks on stacks
Stuck on stacks, stuck on stacks
Stacks, stuck on
She never lonely
Pay for more then lay her on me
And she got stacks
Stuck on stacks
Stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks
Stacks on stacks on stacks
She got stacks, stacks on stacks
Stuck on, stuck on
Stuck on stacks, stuck on
Stuck on stacks
