[Intro]
Faded, faded
Faded
Faded, faded
Faded

[Hook]
I ain't gon' drink no more, gon' drink no more
I ain't gon' drink no more, gon' drink no more
I ain't gon' drink no more, gon' drink no more
I ain't gon' drink no more, gon' drink no more
(Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it)
One more, one more
One more, one more
One more, one more
One more, one more then more and more

[Verse 1]
Think I love you, but I don't know you
What you did last night got a nigga feelin' like I might own you
Watch it come right back
Girl where you get a bum like that?
Truth is I never had fun like that
How you learn to use your tongue like that?
Yeah, you know that I get it
Keys and the crates and it's all for my niggas
If you're ballin' I'm with ya
One more bottle my nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I've been around the globe, did a lot of shows
Things are getting hot, fuckin' on the low
She slidin' down the pole though
Chains clickin' like a photo
I can drink for hours, got that Austin Powers
She in love with the mojo
Said she love me, she loco
Yeah she my polo
Never been sober
No that's a no no
If I want her I get her
Drink way too much liquor
If you're ballin' I'm with ya
One more bottle my nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
Are we alright (faded), are we alright (faded)
Are we alright (faded), are we alright (faded)
Are we alright (faded), are we alright (faded)
Are we alright (faded), are we alright (faded)
Are we alright (faded), are we alright (faded)
