You can be a Nigga just like me—
Walk, talk, act, dress like me
Roll over, beg, fetch like me
Get a check like me
Be a slave—put a chain around your neck like me!
[You need to get like me!]

You can be a Nigga just like me—
Walk, talk, act, dress like me
Roll over, beg, fetch like me
Get a check like me
Be a slave—put a chain around your neck like me!

[Verse 1: A.D. Carson]
I be on that ol’ Coon Ass Nigga shit—
Ice—no flaws, no blemishes;
Niggerish
Skin real black like licorice
Complex—if I could, I would get rid of it
Hate to even mention it
Cool Kids Club, and our membership
Is the color of our skin and it’s
So dark that we don’t wanna live in it
And we think that’s all right like penmanship

[Verse 2: A.D. Carson]
I got a Styrofoam cup, and I’m fillin’ it up
Look at me, Nigga, I’m livin’ it up!
I know you jealous of my ‘6 foot, 7 foot
Kunta wit’ a severed foot
Chain gang swag—take steps that he never took
I’m plankin’ on a million
I’m plankin’ ‘cuz I’m feelin’
So damned fly I should be plankin’ on the ceilin’
I don’t understand it, but I fake it ‘cause I’m willin’
And you so fuckin’ stupid that you take it ‘cause I give it

[Verse 3: A.D. Carson]
Okay kiddies, I’m ‘a teach you all a neat dance:
Get a rope, tie one end around a tree branch
Take the other end that’s hangin’ in the air
While you’re standin’ on a chair
Tie it tight around your neck
Now you’re set. Now you’re set—
All you gotta do is wait
I advise you playin’ your favorite mix tape
Just jump, then you turn and you spin slow
We don’t call it suicide; we call it ‘The Jim Crow’!
