[Verse 1]
I remember one night
Late night, last year
In Crown Heights, me and all my guys was walking
To the store for a blunt
Saw a Porsche
Told my man
I'ma put him in it for him in a coffin
Hit the blunt, I remember coughing
Next thing you know we was popping off tracks
Outside a Brooklyn apartment
With Rob Markman, making genius moves
Without a sponsor
And I just question who gave y'all the  juice
And how could they have seen the truth?
When they sitting in a pew
And the preacher neck glittering with jewels
After church you see em whipping in a coupe
Man, fuck what they be saying on the news
The truth don't change from different views
Everyday they monitor the moves
Then they feed the spirit of the people To the wolves
Everyday guns be going off we ignore it
Activists after someone else report it
Same shit different day we falling for it
Everyday in the studio recording

[Bridge 2x]
Everyday another hustle
Everyday another dollar bill
Everyday somebody come up to me In the streets
And he think he know how I feel
Everyday another conversation
Everyday a new thing to go
Everyday somebody want some shit
I set the standards I take control
(I set the standards I take control)

[Hook 4x]
Everyday a new life
A New lifetime,  a new life line

[Verse 2]
I remember on the weekends
Had to make it to the train
Just to catch another train
Just to make it to the studio
Now I walk out my room, turn left
Take fifteen steps and I'm at my own studio
If I go outside, Wicker Park, Hyde Park, SoHo
Look around you know you see the logo
Cops still prolly lookin for the one who wrote those
Testing our limits always miss as far that go
I don't trust myself under most conditions
So I don't trust them or the politicians
On my soul I'm not going always on ignition
Overthinking jugging for position
Highly type to be all on suspicion
We ain't finished, Head in my hand stressing
Everybody tryna mask their pressure
Every day I'm tyrna pass that threshold

[Bridge 2x]
Everyday another hustle
Everyday another dollar bill
Everyday someone come up to me in the streets
And he think he know how I feel
Everyday another conversation
Everyday a new thing to go
Everyday somebody want some shit
I set the standards I take control
(I set the standards I take control)

[Hook 4x]
Everyday a new life
A new lifetime, a new life line
