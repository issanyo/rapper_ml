"They call me "great" cause I am. That's indisputable
A beautiful mind is what I design these rhymes with
With irrefutable time
A suitable scheme for me to achieve all my doable dreams
Is doing the thing that I do when I bring
This thing that I'm speaking into to the scene and murder a team

Earth, it will seem to you natives that I am creative
But I am just stating my natural
Operation capacity. Naturally
Operating like it's magic, but actually
Where I'm from it's quite the opposite. Grab a seat
People like me seem to populate galaxies
If you follow analogies...

If you following by now you see I spit like
It's like I got something to prove, ain't it?

Well, shit, I got my mind on what I'm gon' do--claim it
What? Thought I was off my fly shit?
Well, you mistaking me, partna
I want my steak and my broccoli and cheese
Waiting on plotting a revolution, like Malcolm, "By any means."
I'm counting on many things:
My fingers and toes, genius and flows, and even dreams
America's nightmare is a nigga who's focusing
Shit, I am what hoping means

If you gon' sleep on me, get you a Posturepedic
Better yet, just dig a hole for your head, cause you 'bout to need it
While you're at it, dig another beside it. It's for your body
Your mind and soul prob'ly be restin' before you lie in it

If you gon' sleep on me, get you a Posturepedic
Better yet, just dig a hole for your head, cause you 'bout to need it
While you're at it, dig another beside it. It's for your body
Your mind and soul prob'ly be restin' before you lie in it."
