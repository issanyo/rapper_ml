[Hook]
Think I'm slippin' when I'm out of town
They don't know the shooters all around
Told my momma I'mma make her proud
Then I went and told my bitch to hold it down
'Cause I'mma come up, yeah, I'mma be rich soon, yeah
I'mma come up, yeah, it's comin' real soon, yeah
I'mma come up

[Verse 1]
Wasn't no long walks in the park
I walk them streets every night
In search of fiends every night
Turnin' dreams to real life
Like fuck what's wrong or right
That young black boy was sellin' white
Just little ol' me and my big ol' forty
Filled with hollow tips, cops kryptonite
My folks didn't win no lottery
So pardon me for this robbery
But my son gotta eat
That's just how it's gotta be
Can't put no price on loyalty
Now my homeboys payin' lawyer's fees
Like back when we was comin' up
And just enough is not enough
When shit was rough, we were tough
When life was cold, kept heaters tucked
No nightmares, you ain't seen enough
Had a way with words, you ain't read enough
You got your savings stashed at your crib
Where baby mama watch your kids
Like you was with me from the start
It'll be wroth it when we hit the finish

[Hook]
Think I'm slippin' when I'm out of town
They don't know the shooters all around
Told my momma I'mma make her proud
Then I went and told my bitch to hold it down
'Cause I'mma come up, yeah, I'mma be rich soon, yeah
I'mma come up, yeah, it's comin' real soon, yeah
I'mma come up

[Verse 2]
They ain't paid me no mind, they ain't give me no help
That's why I stayed on my grind and did this shit by myself
I got two things in this world baby, my word and my wealth
And keep my name out yo mouth, 'cause that ain't good for your health
Don't fuck no regular bitch, I ain't no regular dude
Been in the East with some Crips, been in the West with some Bloods
And all these niggas I'm with ain't gettin' rich off of drugs
You either a hustler or a pimp, that's where it is where I'm from
Yeah, gon' down a bottle when it come to me
I'm in and out when it come to beef
I feel like Shaq when I'm strapped 'cause niggas gotta look up when they talk to me
Bad bitches with me all in line, I had a dime 'fore I had a dime
Hit a bitch and ain't call her since, bought a watch but can't find the time

[Hook]
Think I'm slippin' when I'm out of town
They don't know the shooters all around
Told my momma I'mma make her proud
Then I went and told my bitch to hold it down
'Cause I'mma come up, yeah, I'mma be rich soon, yeah
I'mma come up, yeah, it's comin' real soon, yeah
I'mma come up
