It’s time for the rhyme version of high flying action—
Attacking the boards
Dispersing of personal words for
The purpose of my trying to write right
Is like light shining in a mine
I’m a diamond in the rough

Off of the cuff
You bear arms and couldn’t understand
The fitted flow that snap back like rubberbands

It’s or the fans
Spinning records consecutive
Artists who disregard what executives think and execute

Set and shoot
Letters to my progeny who hopefully
Will know I was a dope emcee;
Dopamine delivery

Slithery snakes, I bitterly break for minimum stakes
Literally
My metaphors are like similes

Similes are metaphors
That are better for your compre-
Henion
Break lines to make you stop and listen

Stop your wishing for a pot to piss in
You ought to listen
Start your vision higher
Trying to eat? Reach for a kitchen
And cook

[Hook]
If you never paid attention
It’s probably cause they never made you listen

So they’re just words that are written
Descriptive of my living and given with my vision

But I say word to the words
When the words that occur hit a nerve or disturb
Said I say word to the words
Word to the words

It’s time for the rap version of first person literature
They say they want it. I give it for sure
Giving it pure. Giving ‘em more
Than what they might expect
Cereal scribble like writing ‘em Chex

And I’m a milk it for all that it’s worth
Pardon the curse
But fuck it. I started from dirt
So it ain’t greed. Imagine that I was a seed
Started to grow, they thought it was weeds

I prove without a doubt

Can’t prune the flowers out. I was out to reach it
Showers, sprout, now I tower over my nemesis

I not only speak it
Love it or just leave it
Even if you’re in hell. Exhale. Breathe it
Now I’m trying to lead it—mean it, be it
Dream it, see it, touch it, teach it

Sensei when I slay y’all
If we talkin’ about G, I’m MJ with a 8-Ball

[Hook]
If you never paid attention
It’s probably cause they never made you listen

So they’re just words that are written
Descriptive of my living and given with my vision

But I say word to the words
When the words that occur hit a nerve or disturb

Said I say word to the words
Word to the words

[3]
It’s time for the word version of absurd purpose
Observe and report
Discursive and worth what it’s served for
The certainest sport. The burner is turnt, and with this torch
I’m earning a score and learning the hordes
Plenty to count on

Permanent scorch. I’m serving the court papers
Aiming the flame, then turning it toward, later
The late comers and hate mongers
Who stay fronting like they wanting more than to take from us

But they make comments, debate products
That we create. They can’t relate
Defiantly state that I’m great [comma]
Unapologetic as I go and get it

Gold bars on reserve – gotta give him credit

Even if it’s unnecessary, unless it’s carried out
You’ll be waiting for tips to figure it out

And even if I will never know what congruent is
If it ain’t this then it’s gratuitous

[Hook]
If you never paid attention
It’s probably cause they never made you listen

So they’re just words that are written
Descriptive of my living and given with my vision

But I say word to the words
When the words that occur hit a nerve or disturb
Said I say word to the words
Word to the words."
