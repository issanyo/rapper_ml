[Chorus]
All a sudden everybody 100, but not too many 1000
I run through the 100, and keep all the rubber, you can bet they 1000s
I got my first 100, then said I need me a 1000
Why keep it a 100? When I could keep it 1000
I'm ready to keep, bet they won't see you, know that I keep it 1000
You know I'm a genius, I keep it G, bet she gon' see a 1000
I'm gunna give her 1000, just keep it 1000
I'm a keep it 1000, just keep it 1000

[Verse 1]
I’m with my G’s, we G’d up, just dropped some G's and re'd up
Soon I bet they'll need us, I just kick back and kick my feet up
I know them boys wan’ meet us, I can make them boys believe us
Yes lord, praise Jesus. Just copped the drop and pulled the seats up
And I just cut them rocks to freeze up, My youngins pop, don’t freeze up
I bet them hoes won't leave us, my bitch brought friends thats down to team-up
'Bout to make a ring for G's up, it's gon' take all night to clean up
I'm a make it hard to keep up, we just live the life you dream of

[Chorus]
All a sudden everybody 100, but not too many 1000
I run through the 100, and keep all the rubber, you can bet they 1000s
I got my first 100, then said I need me a 1000
Why keep it a 100? When I could keep it 1000
I'm ready to keep, bet they won't see you, know that I keep it 1000
You know I'm a genius, I keep it G, bet she gon' see a 1000
I'm gunna give her 1000, just keep it 1000
I'm a keep it 1000, just keep it 1000

[Verse 2]
I ain't never been phony, I put that on my dead homies
Room full of dead presidents just so I don't ever get lonely
Better back, back you don't know me. If your ass fat you better show me
It's like the last game and I'm Kobe, bout to drop 60 large you can't hold me
And these hoes like holy moly, just dropped a fat stack on this Roley
My lifes a movie watch closely, bitch it's Scarface and I'm Tony
We sip the pink and move slowly, what you did last night was unholy
And I keep bad bitches on me, I don't save these hoes I'm no goalie

[Chorus]
All a sudden everybody 100, but not too many 1000
I run through the 100, and keep all the rubber, you can bet they 1000s
I got my first 100, then said I need me a 1000
Why keep it a 100? When I could keep it 1000
I'm ready to keep, bet they won't see you, know that I keep it 1000
You know I'm a genius, I keep it G, bet she gon' see a 1000
I'm gunna give her 1000, just keep it 1000
I'm a keep it 1000, just keep it 1000
