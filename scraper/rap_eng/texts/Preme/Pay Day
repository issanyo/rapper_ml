[Hook: P. Reign]
You're watching news nigga, we did that
Fuck these new niggas, bitch we been that
The life you die for, we live that
I sold my soul to the streets and I don't want it back
Cause man I just bought a chopper
Got it stashed at my mamas
I put the hit on your head
And fly your bitch to Bahamas
Now this the land of the free
The home of the brave
Now wave your watch in the air
It's time to get paid

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
Always pay day, I'll admit it
Just got a new ho, I call her AK
These haters watching, till I cut off the cable
Now all my bitches is stallions
My bedroom look like I stable
Look I don't fight with no fools
My homies shoot when I say so
You niggas must have been born on like the first day of April
Pistol in the potato, I'll pop you your tomato
And if she had is the molly first class down to Turks and Caicos

[Hook]

[Verse 2: P. Reign]
Always pay day, I'll admit it
Verse for the low low, no time to lay lay
Fresh off the runway, home taking off
Bought your bitch some panties, just to take 'em off
If your stunt its not an issue, you got my paper, got a pistol
Baby mama wouldn't miss you, bet she kill you 'fore she kiss you
If you want it, big tittie doubt it take it from me
Wave your watches in the air, time is money

[Hook]

[Verse 3: P. Reign]
Always pay day, I'll admit it
Talking shit from bitch I'm ricks so fuck what they say
If you drink the milk, I'mma bring that cookie
She told me do it, just do it, I will knock you in that pussy
I heard you a actress, well lets make a movie
She brought a group of bitches, now she my favorite groupie
I tell them bitches lay there, like the choppers out
Ass up, face down, bitch gonna Pacquiao

[Hook]

[Outro]
Always pay day
Always pay day
