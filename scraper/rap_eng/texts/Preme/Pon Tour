[Verse 1: P Reign]
You are cordially invited, hope you love it
She ain't fuckin with a nigga on a budget
Babel said to make you gotta trust it
All the killers with me
We're happy to be here but them other shit is real
Shit is real where I'm from
Hundred haters, got a hundred shots sitting in the drum
Shit is major, she gon' fuck me till I cum
I'm a player, if it ain't about the money hit me later
Having meetings with the mayor
Love me from Toronto to Decatur
Give a fuck what a nigga gotta say, bitch i made it (uh)
You are cordially invited, can't knock us
We them guns for the rosters
Fully loaded pistols for imposters
We young shottas
If niggas was a italian, they would call us mobsters
From the block its Reign
Reporting live Till the day i die
I'm the truth never told a lie, still i try
No tears, no tissue caught up in a fish bowl
Schooling niggas riding for my issue
Young and macho, with a little soul new gospel
Shit is getting scary, new hostile
New tools mean new rules its true shit
My old shit better than your new shit
Like I'm Rocko, Uoeno Uoeno
Pick a bitch like eeny meeny miny moe

[Hook: Sample Capleton]
After me lef from Jamaica, go foreign pon tour
Preaching teaching the people fi sure
Answer to Jah when him a knock pon your door
After me lef from Jamaica, go foreign pon tour
Come back an hear say Dirtsman skull bore
Hear say John Pope Paul all come yah pon tour

[Verse 2: P Reign]
You are cordially invited, enjoy the view
I pop champagne with who I'm closest to
If you ain't gettin bread, what you toastin to?
It's money over bitches cause the bitches get emotional
Yeah, I got a new bitch bad as shit, now my old bitch mad as shit
I step up in the stores down on Madison, rate the mannequins
Like I told you I'd be back I'm the man again
Man, Pac would be happy 'cause I'm still thuggin'
Biggie would be proud to see us living lavish
And my girl keep bringing up Marriage
But it's hard to think about it with an actress on my mattress
If it wasn't bout the money when we last spoke
Somebody get that boy a coffin cause he dead broke
I mean, I ain't saying I'm the richest
But you know you can't compare me to these fucking broke niggas
Don't even click like on your fuckin broke pictures
You should instagram your insufficient funds broke nigga
Jordan 5 retro when I used to hop the metro
With this 38 special gang bangin from the get go
Got rich went broke and made it back again
Cause winners never quit and quitters never win
Girl, you better tell a friend to tell a friend
I'm in with the connect I don't ever meet the middle man
