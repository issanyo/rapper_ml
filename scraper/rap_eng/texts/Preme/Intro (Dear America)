[Verse:]
Dear America, I’m only what you made me
Young, black and fuckin crazy!
Please save me
I’m dying inside, can’t you see it in ma eyes?
I’m hopeless, fearless on d outside, gun on ma side
Shit, make me feel all niggas will, build schools, instead of prisons
I’ll stop livin d way I’m livin, probably not mhmm
I’m so used to servin rocks an burnin blocks, I ain’t neva gon’ stop
Been doin dis shit all my life, I’m a lost cause
An what about d rest?
Don’t dem suckaz deserve a chance?
Some’n betta than uh, shoot outs and liquor stores an food stamps?
Maybe if y’all teach dem niggas a craft in d trade
They wouldn’t have to play dat corner
Ya know what I mean, servin dat ye
America, you got a fuckin problem!
An I ain’t neva goin away!
It’s about 20 million other mothafuckas just like me!
Reparations is due, an y’all go pay!
