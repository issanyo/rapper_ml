[Verse 1: Jacob Hoggard]
Took a long, hard look at my life
Lost my way while I was fighting the time
A big black cloud, stormy sky
Followed me while I was living a lie
So heartless, so selfish, so in darkness, when all your nights are starless
You're running outta hope

[Hook: Jacob Hoggard]
But I found the strength inside to see
Found the better part of me
And I'll never let it go

[Chorus: Jacob Hoggard]
I've come a long, long, way
Made a lot of mistakes
But I'm breathin', breathin', that's right and I mean it, mean it
This time I'm a little run down, I've been living out loud
I could beat it, beat it, that's right cause I'm feelin' feelin', invincible
Woah-oh-oh-oh (x3)

[Verse 2: Jacob Hoggard]
When you're gone for a day on your own
You tear your heart out just to find your way home
I've been so high, I've sunk so low
I've come so far, with nothing to show for it
Mistaken, yeah, I got so good at taking
But now I'm tired of faking, this story's getting old

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge: P.Reign]
Jesus peace, I swore on my stones
I rose from the ashes covered in gold
Realized I lived a lie cause I fled the truth
My son asked if there's a god, said I'm living' proof
P. Reign, baby, y'all better believe
When they tell you if it can be dreamed, it can be achieved
Got charged readin', turn on the news and you'll see

[Bridge: Jacob Hoggard]
But I know a way to beat it
Now I'm gonna be invincible!
Woah-oh-oh-oh (x3)
Yeah, now I'm invincible

[Chorus]
