[Verse 1]
I used to say
Do dreams really come true?
Do miracles happen?
Can I get paid for my passion?
When I was young and my American fam would laugh at my accent
I'd say my accent is 'bout as thick as your glasses, ha
Proud to say I've never caught up with fashion
These clothes can't cover your soul
And as of lately
I've been focused on my lady
Fuck bitches, man, them hoes ain't covered in gold
They wouldn't let me cross the borders, the customs had me hold
It's my story, if I ain't tell it, it will never be told
Every man must stand on his own two
I know the grind, [?] taught me how to hustle in '02
From flippin' burgers to committin' burglaries, uh
From winnin' spelling bee's to catchin' felonies, uh
My hood credentials
Such waste of potential
Momma, I pray I make it to make up for what you been through

[Chorus]
Nobody really gets you
Feel like the whole world is against you
And ain't nobody comin' in your rescue
And all you wanna do is be the best you
Just know you're born for this ill life
You ain't the only one goin' through this ill life
All I know how to live is this ill life
They gon' see what I did with this ill life, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Uh, follow my story
See the pain in my steps
Sunshine bring life
So I'ma reign of the death
For the sake of my kid, I'm tryna find some common ground with my ex
But it's hard to get right when you left
And lately shit done got me thinkin'
How I gotta strike in order to become a kingpin
Let that sink in
Quiet in the club, just smokin', drinkin'
Or yellin' free my niggas like I'm Lincoln
Remember when Cole would open for Drake
And I would open for Cole
So I'ma climb to the top, I was still two levels below
That shit just feed the hunger, I have to settle the score
Get off toe, hop out my bike, back to pedellin' dope
Talk about bein' stressed, had to finally accept
I'd be rich if I could catch a reality check
Money ain't never make me
Pussy ain't never slaved me
So trappin' while I'm rappin' just prayin' that Lord you save me

[Chorus]
Nobody really gets you
Feel like the whole world is against you
And ain't nobody comin' in your rescue
And all you wanna do is be the best you
Just know you're born for this ill life
You ain't the only one goin' through this ill life
All I know how to live is this ill life
They gon' see what I did with this life, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Uh, and what I can say?
Besides I want it
Want it more, kinda sore
A young boy make a fossils out of these dinosaurs
Say it, say it loud and proud
Own that shit, I got ownership
I can hand out these eviction notices
Young black landlord
Niggas can't see me like a sandstorm
Big gold medals like we ran for 'em
Still willin' to fall for what we stand for
Violate, I'll cut off your lights like I pulled the lamp cord
Uh, we catch flights then catch feelings
Hard to smell the hate through the scent of a fresh million
Realest niggas recite me, the fake never relate
I'm from where a man is measured by what he got in his safe
[?]
On the corner duckin' police
Know me, I grew up and I blew up now I'm the OG
Slim nigga pockets so big
Got my bitches on a short leash

[Chorus: Preme & [Nicki Minaj?]]
Nobody really gets you
Feel like the whole world is against you
And ain't nobody comin' in your rescue
And all you wanna do is be the best you
Just know you're born for this ill life
You ain't the only one goin' through this ill life
All I know how to live is this ill life
They gon' see what I did with this life, yeah, yeah
