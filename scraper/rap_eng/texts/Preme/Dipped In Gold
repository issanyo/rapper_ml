I just bought a rollie just to dip it in gold
I just bought a rollie just to dip it in gold
I just bought a rollie just to dip it in there
I just, I just, I just, I ju-I ju-I just bought a, I just bought a
I just bought a, I just bought a, I just, I just, I just
I just bought a rollie just to dip it in gold
I just bought a rollie just to dip it in gold
She just bought a rollie just dip it in gold
We just bought some rollies just to dip 'em in gold

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
Go getters, no bullshitters
Got ten lil niggas and they all hitters
Make some buddy tell them strippers we the big tippers
Whole clique full of stars we the big dippers, nigga
See me pull up and the wrist glitter, whoo
Two-stepping in my chinchilla, whoo
Say she smoke and she drink liquor
Well that bitch to tell her bitch to bring a bitch with her, nigga
Showed up, and we showed out
Bout a millie worth of cars when we roll out
Holy moly out my waist, Glock coked out
Gold rollie, white face, wrist coked out
I'm in the A ridin' round with the connect right now
Cause Tip taught a nigga how the birds fly south
When we surf through the strip club hoes wipe out
Got a Boosie on my wrist and that shit wiped down, nigga

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Piped up, rollie iced out
Haters going back and forth, this shit to fight about
I'mma, pull up on you with the lights out
Fuck a, ride and get you ass wiped out, nigga
It ain't nothing but a G thang
In the 6 with bunch of bitches me and P. Reign
Ay wussup? Got the trunk full of sticks on Auto's
Not ya purse, stole the car on forgiatos
Hey, tell the plug weâ€™re leaving with a carload
They ask 'em, who's is telling? Everybody, call Carlos
You don't bang, can't borrow, you keep bread in parlay
You dickhead, you get scared, you repair in my way
You retard, is you not remember who we are?
We shoot you from PR, you pretend to be hard, well we hard
I seen from far away, you got a weak heart
You reputation's to question
I have to check the G card
Membership says expired on it
Just put up ya application, see you lied on it
Ya getting towards the loner, I've got  5 on it
Sky dweller, all yellow, said 5 on it
Turn it
