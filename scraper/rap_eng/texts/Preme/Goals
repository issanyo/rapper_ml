[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
I know you are the one for me

You are the one for me, you are the one for me
My dreams your goals
You are my goals
My wrist shining diamonds (lightning)
My wrist shining diamonds (lightning)
This goals

[Verse 1: Preme]
I got a new whip I got a new bitch
Shawty is too thick don’t want them too thin
I make her go ooh ooh baby
For the new coup baby
For my gang imma bang
Talking [?] baby
Want a bitch that don’t need
Successful bitches succeed
I get some head and go sleep
I hate when hoes just won’t leave
She held me down am I really up
My bitch gon' ride with you giddy up
My dog pump gas like you filling up
Tell em bring through packs imma hit em up
Yeah I just speculating
You deserve attention baby
No mission is impossible
But I’m about that action baby
Cruising with the tommy on me
Me and Dre been blocking haters
Play the post and they can’t fade us we been ballin all week

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
I know you are the one for me
You are the one for me
I know
I know
You are the one for me you are the one for me
My dreams your goals
You are my goals
My wrist shining diamonds (lightning)
My wrist shining diamonds (lightning)
This goals

[Verse 2: Tyla Yaweh]
I got a new whip I got a new bitch
I’m on this new shit popping this new shit
That's goals

Hey, yeah
I was smoked up
I moved out
In my new mansion
I can go out?
Got a new Porsche
Had to skrtt out
Got a new bitch
She got her hair up

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
I know you are the one for me
You are the one for me

I know you are the one for me
You are the one for me
My dreams
Your goals
You are my goals
My wrist shining diamonds (lightning)
My wrist shining diamonds (lightning)
