"People ask me why I say the shit I say in front of white folks
As if the things I say should just remain with me and my folks
But why folks
Be thinking my communication’s harsh

When sentences they say have niggas locked behind them bars

And stories they be telling and be publishing in books
Will turn around and make fucking saint out of a crook

And faces that I look at doing crime ain’t just like mine
But you won’t get that picture if you stay inside the lines
And so I stay inside a mind dividing time on either side of truth and lies
Because we’re meant to scrutinize. Who decides who we get euthanized by?
Not shootings, drive bys
Or “black-on-black crime,”
I’m wondering ‘bout them white lies
That they be telling you and I ‘bout you and I in U-N-I-
Versities so verses be the the truest kind. I’m looking for congruent minds to match my wits with
When truth get hard, they nitpick
But I ain’t trying to argue with no nitwit

So you can go tell ‘em I said it. I meant it. I’ll tell ‘em myself if they willing to hear it

[I ain't running away from my words
Just make sure I said what you heard.]

You can go tell ‘em I said it. I meant it. I’ll tell ‘em myself if they willing to hear it

[I don't care it you're feeling disturbed
Or that you feel it's absurd.]

You can go tell ‘em I said it. I meant it. I’ll tell ‘em myself if they willing to hear it

[If my word is my bond
I gotta be certain that I'm
Observant and working with mine.]

You can go tell ‘em I said it
I meant it
I’ll tell ‘em myself

I don’t need another February. Seldom, very rarely, next to never
Should you put the education ‘bout your greatness on oppressors

So what he has to teach you
Comes more from how he treats you
And not just when he need you or your people
I peep bull
It’s all beef
And I don’t have no cares ‘bout what they call me
I’m all me
And for that, I’m not sorry
So hard we work to hardly herd the heart that hurts the hardly heard
And we’re disturbed
By how often that pot is stirred
So when they turn and say it’s race bait when I’m calling out race hate
I keep on talking. I ain’t trying to placate
Or waste space trying to debate the hate haters create with its creator
I make haste. Lying ain’t got no place in my relations
So statements ain’t offending me
Nor is your opinion of me
It’s more or less the the moral-less supremacy
Since people have them tendencies from coming through this system we call living
I guess they think that shit should be forgiven. It ain’t

I don’t want you to do me no favors
I don’t want you to do me no solids
I don’t want you to teach me your hatred
I don’t want to be ruled by your scholars
I don’t want to be seen as your problem
My problem is what you created
Then you framed it as if it was me

Insisted that you should debate it

I take it as kind of a compliment
That I often get the blame for the shit that I cannot control
But if we discuss it, it’s really insulting
I come from the people whose land that you stole
Bodies you took. And I can’t trust a guy who’s a crook
With a view that denies me a look
And then puts it inside of a book that they teach me to read, if they do
It’s to treat me like I should be shook

And that's only the half
I'll travel the loneliest path
Doing felonious math
Erroneous, maybe, but these are the stakes: the baloney you gave me

Is created from wrongs that have made me
The man that you hate, see?

But it ain't me...
So it can't be

That American Dream seems like hell of a scheme

And it’s deep…’cause in order to dream, then you gotta be sleep

And what am I, but a guy interrupting the lullaby?
And if that don’t work. So what, I try

Y’all remember that story about Issey?
Old Sawney’s daughter?

You know, they say she tried to burn down the plantation house

Shit...

I wish she had’ve done that shit

And you can tell ‘em I said it...

‘cause I did."
