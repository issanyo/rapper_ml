I used to be the kind of guy who was kind of fly
Kind of like the type who like to ride a bike despite the sun not shining bright
I like to think it was perspective, but if I was perceptive
Then I’d know it’s cause I was neglected
Mother f’n up the child support checks wit’
Whatever she dealt with—card house falling on itself
So my heart turns cold—poppa at the club, try'n'a get paid;
Diamonds a girl’s best friend; we call a spade by his name
And I saying this emotionally, supposing if we
Had the Huxtable family, then that luxury could’ve damaged me more
Than I am, and, see, I don’t believe in mistakes like
Snake bites, brakes lights, nothing more than fate, right?
Crap shoot, shake dice. At least you took the gamble
A man don’t got a chance if he just watching from the side
It’s easy to say, “He lost.” but harder to say “I tried.”
It’s simple to know the theory…let’s see it when it’s applied
Supply and demand manhandles many, and anybody who’s tellin’ you diff’rent prob'ly
Don’t understand economics
You see, that bike I was riding around on when it was cloudy
Was really just to prepare me for folks who were stationary
And daring me to be diff’rent, I channeled it into this. It’s
Medicinally elicited, written like a prescription, shit

Take two listens and call me when you get it
I’ll write you another one that’s more potent if you don’t feel it. But you will

[Hook]
And I meant it just for you...
For when you need some words that are words that you listen to
Or when you need ‘em to give, just distribute…
These few…are some that I use to get me through

You see, I’m not the same guy that I used to be
And if I’m judged by the past, then I’ll be glad to say that
I can look at yesterday’s sorrows and see tomorrow
Borrow lessons I learned, and turn ‘em into my future

I used to be the kind of dude who was kinda rude
Blind from booze. Try’n’a lose myself in myself. Got into
The driver’s seat, and I can speak from experience when I tell ya
It’s a real thin line in between success and failure
Heaven and Hell are rarely seen and described for the living
Either you get on with it or be imprisoned by the constant thoughts
The kind of talk that make you doubt your purpose
They only see your surface. If you believe your worth is
Less or greater, let ‘em make you buy into it, there’s your fate, ‘cause
You are who determines who you will be. Not him or me

You see that car I was driving around in when I was drinking
Was really to get me thinking how this could end in a blink
And when my eyes opened—the cries choking back the pain—
How can I explain how that’s a gain, except for saying

“Take two listens and call me when you get it
I’ll write you another one that’s more potent if you don’t feel it. But you will.”

You see, I’m not the same guy that I used to be
And if I’m judged by the past, then I’ll be glad to say that
I can look at yesterday’s sorrows and see tomorrow
Borrow lessons I learned, and turn ‘em into my future

I’m not so certain that I even got the choice to press Play

I found myself by myself, told myself this discovery was monumental
Because there were no subjects similarly stenciled
Just me, and as long as I used pencil to craft my story
I could go back and erase the parts I didn’t like;
I could fill in the spaces where I didn’t write;
I could shade the pages or dim the lights where I deemed appropriate

Because I was in control

I didn’t start the game
Didn’t have to blow in a cartridge
To un-glitch it. I just had to “get with it.”

No series of switches or configuration of keystrokes
Gave me hope of one day winning

And I’m not even certain that I chose to press Play

I found myself by myself, told myself this discovery was monumental
Because there were no subjects similarly stenciled
Just me, and as long as I used pencil to craft my story

I could shade the pages or dim the lights where I deemed appropriate
