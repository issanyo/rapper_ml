(Verse 1) Joseph Rose
You don't a fuckin' clue of what I'm capable to do, only accountable to be win the one that just walks into the room and shoot
No Steph Curry, I ain't dribblin' and shootin' hoops, I'm runnin' through alley ways, chasin' someone that owes me loot
Makin' my stops through the city in the coop, always stay in a loop, make sure I check with every troop
Got the iPhone, BlackBerry, Samsung and Motorola, hit my e-mail, our voice caused it out of order
Don't even say it, guaranteed they got my phone tapped, listen to the clickin' and echo in sounds in the back
Young entrepreneur, all about my business endeavors, I'll never jump ship retopped to pow-pow ever (Fuck that)
I got the hot tail drivin' around in circles, gettin' head from your bitch until my dick is purple
In the kitchen whip it double time, 'ya all turtle, ship it off quick, make it drop and fit the murder

(Hook) Joseph Rose
I'm the just livin' the high life
Only got one, so I'm gonna do it right
'45 stashed under the passenger side..
In case somebody wanna come and commit suicide
You don't wanna make me lose control
You better chill, homie.. take it slow
You talk a lot of shit, that's what I've been told
Don't wanna make the twelve gauge barrel blow

(Verse 2) P Reign
Baby sleepin' on me while I'm gettin' restless, I just made my entrance, you was headin' for the exit
Young-thug nigga but I bet they get the message, I can quit rappin' right now, I got investments.. all my niggas wild (True)
Bottles in my section, I tell that hoe get undressing, bitch.. I get to steppin'
Her booty is a blessing, she use it as a weapon, if I painted the Porshe yellow, only time I drive a lemon
The whip is never used, I ride in something new, let a nigga touch me, I bet he make the news
Call up the connect, for bricks I gotta choose, a million a week.. bitch, enjoy the views
I drop drop drop drop back in this bitch like, strapped up, we don't fist fight, pull up quick in your bitch like, 50k what your wrist like
Last man standing for the "W"
I done seein' nigga switched up for a buck or two, fuck is you

(Hook) Joseph Rose
I'm the just livin' the high life
Only got one, so I'm gonna do it right
'45 stashed under the passenger side..
In case somebody wanna come and commit suicide
You don't wanna make me lose control
You better chill, homie.. take it slow
You talk a lot of shit, that's what I've been told
Don't wanna make the twelve gauge barrel blow
