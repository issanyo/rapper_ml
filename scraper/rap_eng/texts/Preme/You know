[p.reign]Yea i'm getting money

[Chorus]
You know why we stay so fly
Lay back in the middle
While i'm doing my thang
[p.reign]Yea i'm geting money

[verse 1]
You see when i'm flying threw
Caddy's midnight black
Wrist alligator green
Chain ocean blue
Honey - in black what you wanna do
You say you got money this how you suppose to do
I grind cause i have to
Not cause i want to
This brother knows what he wants
And he wants you
The woman call me a g and it's so true
But i was raised like this it ain't my fault boo
I'm from a hood where you have to go get it
You never know where you go so you gotta get it
Now lets lighten up the car
When i said i was a star i meant it
You see's how daddy do ya you never wanna leave
You get a chest cold from my chain and i freeze ya
Money in the bank from Halloween to Easter
Forget about your man tell him you have amnesia

[Chorus]

[VERSE 2]
They see me in the streets blow smoke out the roof
New coupe got it in my ear called bluetooth
Dying for my help don't be shy
Your lying to urself you know you wanna ride
Stick him n just get by
Come with me n come get fly
Are you gotta worry about is louis, gouache,gucci amoni, product on ya body
These other dudes will go broke tryna copy
The feds can't keep up tryna watch me
So how the hell are they gonna stop me
I'm the block fit the hustle kid knock it
Bank row fishers you never lose an option
???? tremendous you never tell him stop it
Ride with ur boy ur fy up in the cock pit

[Chorus]

[VERSE 3]
Don't ever disrespect the king i'm a fetch
Doing like a check board i'm putting in check
?? vest
Look at my neck..lace
Now thats a different part of the body ur blessed with
