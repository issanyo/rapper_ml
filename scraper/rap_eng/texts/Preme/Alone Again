[Intro: Alyssa Reid]
Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

[Verse 1: P.Reign]
I sit back and reminisce, it hurts to think about it all
We was on top of the world, whoever though that we would fall?
Standing by the phone, alone, ignoring your call
I feel like Spider Man, you got me flying off of the wall
I ain't wanna leave, but still I had to go
Cause what good's a rainbow with out my pot of gold?
And now your beds empty and your pillows cold
You never realised the love until my love was gone

[Pre-Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

[Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

[Verse 2: Alyssa Reid]
The phone call
Can you stop the free fall?
Can you be the reason I can see beyond the lies
If I keep holding on?
I hear you (Hear you)
Can you stop the screaming? (Screaming)
Did you stop believing?
I could feel you letting go, I can't be alone tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you
Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

[Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

[Bridge: Alyssa Reid]
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Woah, I hope that it won't end though
Alone...
And I'm hoping that you know that

[Chorus: Alyssa Reid]
Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you (Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
