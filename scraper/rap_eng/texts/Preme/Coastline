[Verse 1]
I just can't figure out your problem
Got tings on the line but you know I ain't call 'em, yeah
And that's probably 'cause you was never really all in
And that's been the reason why I've been wylin'
I can't trust that silence
Young boy tryna get an island in Hawaii
Been goin' long don't try me
All these girls tryna look like Kylie
You shoulda stuck right by me

[Pre-Chorus]
These days don't want nobody else
And these days I'm good all by myself

[Chorus]
I remember sneakin' in your old house
But nowadays I just bring the hoes out
Was waitin' on you but gotta now
Fast life, ain't no way to slow down
I ain't tryna flex but the wrist out
Where were you when I was in the worst drought
All I ever do is make the hits now
You ain't gotta tell me what it is now

[Post-Chorus]
These days don't want nobody else
And these days I'm good all by myself

[Verse 2]
These girls all wanna pick in my pocket
Bet they wouldn't be around if I had it then lost it
And chasin' you 'round got me so exhausted
And you were always the girl I wanted
Got a new bitch don't want ya
Said I never put time in
I was doin' it for us, I was grindin'
You got curves like a road that's windin'
But crazy is all you drive me

[Pre-Chorus]
These days don't want nobody else
And these days I'm good all by myself

[Chorus]
I remember sneakin' in your old house
But nowadays I just bring the hoes out
Was waitin' on you but gotta now
Fast life, ain't no way to slow down
I ain't tryna flex but the wrist out
Where were you when I was in the worst drought
All I ever do is make the hits now
You ain't gotta tell me what it is now

[Post-Chorus]
These days don't want nobody else
And these days I'm good all by myself

[Bridge]
They playin' this game
So stuck in your ways
You took it for granted
I'm tryna be saved
What we had vanished
'Cause you gave it away
At the end of the day
There's nothin' to say

[Chorus]
I remember sneakin' in your old house
But nowadays I just bring the hoes out
Was waitin' on you but gotta now
Fast life, ain't no way to slow down
I ain't tryna flex but the wrist out
Where were you when I was in the worst drought
All I ever do is make the hits now
You ain't gotta tell me what it is now

[Post-Chorus]
These days don't want nobody else
And these days I'm good all by myself
