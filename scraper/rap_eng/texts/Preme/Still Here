[Verse 1]
6AM in the 6ix
I'm still up
I'm still fucked up
Still tryna see what's up
Still ridin' 'round with my thugs
Still lookin' for a way to come up
Don't need no more of that love
Still comin' round just 'cause
Still fuck a club with a check
Still comin' down on your neck
Still I'm gon' flex
Still can't relate to the hate
Still tryna ball everyday
Still got cake
Still I'm up workin' late
Still tryna put you on game
Still I'm gon' play
Still gotta grind everyday
Still tryna build that safe
Lil' nigga yeah

[Chorus]
I'm still here, I'm still here
I'm still winnin'
I'm still here, I'm still here
I'm still winnin'
I'm still livin'
I'm still here

[Verse 2]
While we all here
Let's get one thing clear
If we ain't talkin' 'bout money, please get the fuck out my ear
Runnin' from the past
Right foot sittin' heavy on the gas
Tryna leave the bullshit in the rear
Gettin' tired of sayin' every year's my year
But fuck it this year's my year and that's clear
A nigga been paid 'fore I ever had a deal
Almost three strikes but I dodge that jail
Got two kids and they miss no meal
And one thing they can never say I'm not real
Zero fucks given
Always had the vision
Always been committed
Always stuck with it
My ex ain't smoke but she drink a lil' liquor
And had enough bread to split the bill with a nigga
I still check your moms at the bank ball lunch
Just to hear her tell me that I shoulda been the one
She ask how I'm doin', how's it goin' with the music
Then I tell her I'ma prove it and my time gon' come
And she was always down 'til I let her down
Now I'm like Pac, I just get around
Heard them new niggas got it poppin' now
But I still run the city when I'm not in town, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm still here, I'm still here
I'm still winnin'
I'm still here, I'm still here
I'm still winnin'
I'm still livin'
I'm still here
I'm still here, I'm still here
I'm still winnin'
I'm still here, I'm still here
I'm still winnin'
I'm still livin'
I'm still here
