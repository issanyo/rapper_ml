“[James Baldwin]:
“I’m going to improvise, like a writer, on some assumptions

And, though I feel a little uneasy in doing this—and saying this—nevertheless
What a writer is obliged, at some point, to realize
Is that he’s involved in a language
Which he has to

Change.”

He walked from just above rock bottom, to not stardom
But starting to understand my problems are probably all my own
And know, homie, I’m holding my own
Owning my own plan like the man I was destined to be
A dot desires the finer
Denies the defining
He lies where the diamonds you find in the rough are stuffed—
No fucks given. If it’s just living then live yours
I’ll live mine, and we’ll cross courses in due time
If not, then no bother, I’m hardly at odds wit it
I chill—a homebody—attracted to odd women
Party wit’ gods—nope, not church, not a façade
I read books for fun, make students out of a squad

It’s not a game, not the same shit you’re used to
I do it cause I find it suitable – and hope you will decide it’s beautiful
But never my aim is to make what you want how you want when you want it
I make what I like when I write. I’m alright when it’s right, so I’m writing this here in this moment

[Hook]
So, fuck what you want
I write what I what I write
And I’m cool. So what if you don’t
I like what I like
I’m impatient, and blatantly making my statements despite
Any space of complacency
I write what I like

So, fuck what you want
I write what I what I write
And I’m cool. So what if you don’t
I like what I like
I’m impatient, and blatantly making my statements despite
Any space of complacency
I write what I like

Every time they say, “I’m different” I hear ‘em but I don’t listen
I’m near ‘em, but I don’t feel like we close to the same position
I spit like I’m on a mission to kill ‘em. A mercenary, I hit ‘em
With verses dare ‘em to stand toe-to-toe wit’ me
I’m ready, but they ain’t really ‘bout that do it ‘cause they do it
They be doing what they thinking everybody else be doing
That’s stupid
I’m on that do what I be wanting to hear
So, if you like it, then that’s cool, ‘cause I got more of it here
And If you don’t, then that’s alright, you can move on to the rear
It ain’t my job to make you love it if you don’t, then it’s clear
So it’s back to the black hoodie, back to the black fitted
Back to the basics. Hate it or take it. It’s black business

It’s not a game, not the same shit you’re used to
I do it cause I find it suitable – and hope you will decide it’s beautiful
But never my aim is to make what you want how you want when you want it
I make what I like when I write. I’m alright when it’s right, so I’m writing this here in this moment

[Hook]
So, fuck what you read
I write what I what I write
And I know, but fuck what she said
I like what I like
I’m impatient, and blatantly making my statements despite
Any space of complacency
I write what I like

Fuck what you read
I write what I what I write
And I know, but fuck what she said
I like what I like
I’m impatient, and blatantly making my statements despite
Any space of complacency
I write what I like

No shade, but this rap shit’s so played, and filled with actors
And scripts it’s like Hamlet, quite the cast of characters
I find it precarious [look it up]
I just want to do what I do, and I look at us
And say, “Do it
No pretense. No pre-rinse. No pretend. No free days. No weekends.”
Know he spends - notes and ends - with lonely friends
From the start until the dope beat ends
And while I’m at it, that’s Preme on the track, give him a hand for
Keys, strings, kick drum, snare—it’s just a sample
Of what I’m saying we do, and we got ample
Ammo
Joe, we cool like a pack of Camels

It’s not a game, not the same shit you’re used to
I do it cause I find it suitable – and hope you will decide it’s beautiful
But never my aim is to make what you want how you want when you want it
I make what I like when I write. I’m alright when it’s right, so I’m writing this here in this moment

[Hook]
So, fuck what you think
I write what I what I write
Do you. Drink what you drink
I like what I like
I’m impatient, and blatantly making my statements despite
Any space of complacency
I write what I like

Fuck what you think
I write what I what I write
Do you. Drink what you drink
I like what I like
I’m impatient, and blatantly making my statements despite
Any space of complacency
I write what I like

[James Baldwin]:
“I dropped into a silence
In which I heard—for the first time really heard—and began to be able to try to deal with
The beat
Of the language of the people who had produced me…

I was able to hear that music….””
