[Chorus: Travis Whittaker]
Oh, Elohim
Oh, Elohim

[Verse 1: Travis Whittaker]
It's Your voice that echoes over many waters
Your voice spoke and created me
It's Your voice that breaks the mighty cedar
It's Your voice that broke my stubborn heart

Oh, Elohim
Oh, Elohim
Oh, Elohim
Oh, Elohim

It's Your voice that flashes flames of fire
Your voice consume my every sin
It's Your voice that shakes the Earth and Heaven
It's Your voice that makes me stand secure

[Chorus: Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph]
Oh, Elohim
Oh, Elohim
Oh, Elohim
Oh, Elohim

Show me how to worship You just as the angels do
Just as the angels do
I declare that you are Lord
I'm in awe of You, Lord
Show me how to worship You just as the angels do
Just as the angels do
