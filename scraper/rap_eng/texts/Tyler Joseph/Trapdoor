[Verse 1]
He wakes up early today
Throws on a mask that will alter his face
Nobody knows his real name
But now he just uses one he saw on a grave

[Pre-Chorus]
And he pretends he's okay, but you should see, oh
Him in bed late at night, he's petrified

[Chorus]
Take me out, and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor

[Verse 2]
He thinks that faith might be dead
Nothing kills a man faster than his own head
He used to see dreams at night
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
And he pretends he's okay, but you should see
Him in bed late at night, he's petrified

[Chorus]
Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah!

[Break]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
When you watch him fall through a blatant trapdoor

[Outro]
'Cause nobody knows he's alive
