Sometimes I leave, I hate,
What is wrong with me?
When I am late,
But you would never say,
I'm going down,
And you would never stop,
Searching lost and found.

'Cause I don't understand,
Why you would care,
And I don't know why,
Your love is unfair,
But you will never change.

Sometimes I live for you,
For them and there's times
When I couldn't care less,
And I will never say,
That they're going down,
And I will look for them,
In this lost and found.

'Cause I don't understand,
Why you would care,
And I don't know why,
Your love is unfair,
'Cause you will never change.
You will never change.

You will never change.
You will never change.
