[Verse 1]
You walk around like you are fine
So confident in life, so right
But then I found you were afraid
And that means life is not okay

I wonder what's inside your mind
And if there's anything to find
I hope that you awake some day
And see that life is not okay

[Chorus]
I will sing for you a song
Tell me if you think that's wrong
If I let you know I'm here
Cause I am falling down
I would laugh away the pain
Did you know I'd run all day
Just to maybe hear you say
That you are falling too

[Verse 2]
I know you are afraid of many things
But you need to let go
If you want to sing a praise

[Chorus]
I will sing for you a song
Tell me if you think that's wrong
If I let you know I'm here
Cause I am falling down
I would laugh away the pain
Did you know I'd run all day
Just to maybe hear you say
That you are falling too

[Outro]
I will sing for you
I will sing for you
