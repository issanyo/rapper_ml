[Instrumental Introduction]

[Verse 1]
I know you're not a liar and
I know you could set fire this day
Go ahead and make me look away
Strike me down, I am calling your
Lightning down from your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me your face

[Chorus]
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down

[Verse 2]
I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed by your ways
Why would you let us use your name?

[Chorus]
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me

[Outro]
Reign down (Down)
Reign down (Down)
(Down, down reign)
