[Part 1: Witt Lowry]
Dear Mark, you're the one with the words
But my side should be heard
Think that it's fuckin' absurd
You talk about me when you rap about her
All of your songs, hear about all of my wrongs
Like you never played me like pong
Like you never went out and did nothin' wrong
It's crazy forever turned into so long
And now that you're gone, I had to move on
And I'm happy with him
But I still can't pretend that I didn't go fuck with your friend
Every now and again
I be thinkin' of then
I be thinkin' that that was something I would never intend
And especially, when it was me who you trusted
To take on your feelings and try to remend, it's so hard pretend
I would lie in your bed, givin' you head
Listen to all of the things that you said
Listen to all of the lyrics you read
You were chasing a dream, I would party instead
Young and in love, young and we're dumb
I can taste all of the pain in your tongue
I can taste all of my pain in the rum
Knew it was over before it begun
Lookin' for fun, burning my lungs
Learnin' my favorite feeling was numb
Bought every dinner, you barely bought one
Maybe I cheat, and then we could be done
That would be dumb, we were so broke
You were the one that turned into a joke
I kept us afloat
You were the one that kept us on the rope, damn

[Chorus: Halsey]
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down
I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

[Part 2: Witt Lowry]
Now you are the man, huh?
I see you turned into somebody I can't stand, huh?
Knowin' you, man, it's all part of your plan, huh?
You crazy fuck, I had the chance, I should've ranâ€”uh!
Never would tell me you cared, never were there
Remember that night that we went to the fair?
Every fine girl that walked by, you would stare
See, even when there, Mark, you never were there
If all I care 'bout is my makeup and hair
All you care 'bout is the ego you wear
You tear me apart, continue to tear
Now I'm with someone who actually cares
Fuck you! But I can't keep you off my mind
I'm seein' everything you drop
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
You make me relive my mistake
A million trillion fucking times
See, you're a coward
And a stupid rap persona is what you hide behind
And my whole family still adores you
I tried a million times, I would have only did that for you
I can't act like I don't know you
Every night I would explode, you
Made me feel I was below you
Mark, I wish I could ignore you, but I can't, damn

[Chorus: Halsey]
I've got a lover, a love like religion
I'm such a fool for sacrifice
He's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

I've got a lover and I'm unforgiven
I'm such a fool to pay this price
It's coming down, down, coming down
It's coming down, down, coming down

[Part 3: Witt Lowry]
I hope that you get everything that you want
As you yell and you stand on the stage
You took all your pain and turned it to fame
They're screaming your name and going insane
I kept all our pics but threw out the frame
Before I knew Witt, I knew Mark, now they're one and the same
But what about me, motherfucker?
Forgot about me, motherfucker?
Except when you talk about me, motherfucker
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout me, motherfucker
Your mouth was a blessin' and now it's a weapon
Remember the time and the love we invested
I'm postin' a pic and I'm getting attention
My tits and my ass get a favorite a second
See, you were with me but were thinking of her
Now I'm with him and I'm thinking of you
Together to never, whatever we were
We're stuck in a cycle, the cycle is cruel
A couple of fools, stuck in a pool
Of people that want to be cool
See, we're never happy, we're happy
So we keep on searching for love as if love was a jewel
Remember that night that you came to my school?
Stayed up all night and we talked about life
My parents and I, we would constantly fight
You said when you make it, I might be a stay-at-home wife
Apparently, that wasn't right
We lived in a moment that lasted a night
And, honestly, Mark, gotta start to move on with your life
Sincerely, a letter we never would write

[Part 4: Witt Lowry]
Like, what are we doin'? Like, what am I doin'?
Writing these letters, but what am I provin'?
I'm stuck in my room and I'm spilling it all
Thinking of what you would say if you call
I might be the biggest mistake of 'em all
My biggest mistake was to think that I never could fall
Like falling for you, falling in love
Follow my dream and that's all of my love
I just want to feel, I've been feelin' so numb
To think that I know how you're feelin' is dumb
We're done, right from the start
I write from the heart, a light in the dark
They see that you're open and tear you apart
Now this is our letter, we sign it sincerely, Mark
