[Intro]
Fast food, greasy
Taco I love

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
Nacho bell grande, Cheesy gordita
I like your nachos like diarrhea
Man, I really like Taco bell

[Verse 2: Jay Joseph]
I know I can't
Watch you make my food
Drop it on the floor
I think it's rude
Man I really like
Taco bell

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
Here's to the Mexican
Who makes me my food (me gusta)
How is that I just ate
Now I have to poop

[Bridge: Tyler and Jay Joseph]
Fast food, greasy
Taco I love
Food like this could
Only come from above
Fast food, greasy
Taco I love
Food like this could
Only come from above

[Verse 3]
Rob the taco store and ask â€˜em for a refill
Hey this is JRizzle
Listen up all y'all
I'm winning tacos just because of this gumball
I put chalupas where my mouth is
So watch this
Because I'm the dopest rapper
That you've ever messed with

[Verse 4: Tyler & Jay Joseph]
Sir, welcome to Taco Bell
May I take your order
Yeah can I have a big mac and a pepsi
Sir we don't sell big macs
And some chicken nuggets
We don't have chicken nuggets either
Serious?

[Verse 5: Tyler Joseph]
T-A-C-O B-E double L
The cashier's name is Omar Vizquel
People always
Persecute me
But I know they'll die
For eating Chipotle

[Verse 6: Tyler & Jay Joseph]
How is it that you
Could hate
Good old taco bell
And how is it that you
Could like Chipotle

[Verse 7: Tyler & Jay Joseph]
We walked into the Taco Bell
Because I was craving some crunchy shell
The man behind the counter said oopah (oopah)
I was flying as high as a kite
And I looked up to my delight
They were having a special on chalupas
My chalupa
My chalupa
My chalupa
My chalupa

[Verse 8: Jay & Tyler Joseph]
And as you know there was a man
Who preached the truth
On rock and sand
And Jesus won't hold your sins to you
And we all know he broke the bread
But I know that St. Peter said
That his favorite food was chalupas
My chalupa
My chalupa
My chalupa
My chalupa

[Verse 9: Tyler & Jay Joseph]
I love this song
Beef
It's a good song
And Cheese
Beef and cheese
Beef and cheese yeah
Beef and cheese in a taco shell yeah
Beef and cheese in a taco shell
Take that it'll make you fat
We got the stuff that'll your booty go
Take that it'll make you fat
We got the stuff that'll your booty go
Take that it'll make you fat
We got the stuff that'll your booty go
Take that it'll make you fat
We got the stuff that'll your booty go
Beef and cheese
Beef and cheese
And lettuce
Beef and cheese
Beef and cheese
And lettuce
Beef and cheese
Beef and cheese
Okay
And lettuce
Beef and cheese
Beef and beef and cheese

[Verse 10: Jay Joseph]
Now is the time
That we end this song
Without tacos
Life would be wrong
Man I really love taco bell

[Tyler Joseph]
Michael was right
Tacos are great
If you're real hungry
They're open real late
Man I really love taco bell

[Chorus]
Here's to the Mexican
Who makes me my food (me gusta)
How is that I just ate
Now I have to poop

[Outro]
I'm full
So dude there's these two black guys in a bar
Hey shh we're still recording
