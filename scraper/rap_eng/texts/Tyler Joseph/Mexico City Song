We're here in Mexico city
Having a good time

We're here in Mexico city
We're making all these rhymes

We'll eat some beans and rice and stuff and make it all so great
We'll eat some tacos... Do you have Chipotle here?

(That's a question, do you have Chipotle here? It's what we want. It's what we want, more than anything.)

We're here in Mexico city
Making all these tunes

We're here in Mexico city
We wish you were here too
