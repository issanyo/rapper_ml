[Verse 1]
You split
And take in every time you see
A fake and counterfeit
In the mirror you appear
To see fear
And whisper this is it
In the mirror you appear
To see nothing else
But yourself as a face
A hollowed out space
Leave me with the razor
Just in case
I fall face down on the ground
And somehow I found
Enough strength to lift my face
And make a sound
And muffled though it may be
And crazy it seems
I never felt closer to you
Just crying as you torture me

[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
To the earth and now my worthless life
Cuz everything I've ever made
Is dead now
Inside the grave [x2]

[Verse 2]
I just don't wanna be
So many things
And now that I see
I just wanna sing
I just wanna breath
I just wanna fly
I just wanna close my eyes
And take in the sun
And take in the air
I just wanna run
And murder my care
I wanna believe that I will be
Free elsewhere

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
Trying my hardest to make it
To you but I built this tower
Out of mortal bricks
They're breaking
I truly will surrender
My pretender
My disguise
And I'll truly start to
Render to your splendor
So it's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
