[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1]
We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

[Chorus]
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Alright, second verse
What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
Don't want to know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here, oh
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

[Chorus]
But I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
