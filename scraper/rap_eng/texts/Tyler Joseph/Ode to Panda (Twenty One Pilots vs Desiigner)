[Panda Music Intro]

[Intro: Tyler Joseph]
[?] There weren't any rules when I wrote that song, I- uh, I wanted to slow the tempo down, and then sing, I wanted to change the tempo again, I wanted to rap

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, "Please, oh please!"
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this
Is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one
Be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands
I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon, forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see harpoon

[Verse 2: Tyler Joseph]
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes, cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, "There's something we need!"
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

[Desiigner]
Panda... Panda... Panda... Panda panda panda panda panda panda panda....

[Outro: Tyler Joseph]
Doesn't make any sense...
