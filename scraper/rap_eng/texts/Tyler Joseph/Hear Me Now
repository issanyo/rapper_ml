[Intro]
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Words of mine
Words of yours
Confusing rhymes
And confusing wars
Between words of love
And words of hate
Wars of dreams
And wars of fate

[Verse 2]
Once again I step inside my shoes
A battle now for every single thing I do
And I don't care because I don't have a clue
I seem to close all the windows in my room
That tell me how I am comfortable inside this broken, tainted, skin that I'm in
I can't win
I need you to break me up, break me down to the sound
So I can pray that somebody hears me now
Just pray that someone hears me now

[Verse 3]
There was a moment in my life
Where I thought that you were gone
And every moment of my life
Was just a pretend fake, so

I go to sleep every night
I should be good at it by now
But very lonely is tonight
And time stands still
So now I try to picture you with all the kingdom I can't find
Fighting, grabbing, turning to you with this little mind
I think I saw the kingdom gate, this feeling I must keep
Walking closer, crack the door and then I fall asleep
Because every time I think I see your face it fades away
And turns to gray Then I pray you save the day
Anyhow, I just pray that someone hears me now

[Outro]
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Lets pray someone hears me now
