I hate clikkies

(Chorus 2)
I hate clikkies

I hate clikkies
They should go stan Drake

(Verse)

They tell me to go to bed
Even though it's only 4 am
They never are really nice

(Bridge)
I hate clikkies
I hate clikkies
I really hate clikkies
I hate clikkies
I hate clikkies
I really hate clikkies

(Verse 2)
They only like Joshua Dun
They only like Joshua Dun
I hate clikkies
I hate clikkies
They only like Joshua Dun
They only like Joshua Dun
I really hate
