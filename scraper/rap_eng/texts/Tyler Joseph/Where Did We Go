[Spoken Intro:]
Making sweet music
What?

[Verse 1:]
We are people blind
Once again, we think we have the lights
We pretend we live such perfect lives
But we know we don't have love divine, yeah

[Chorus:]
We try to fly without the wings of mine
We'll die, fragile lives again
We won't proceed in this life
If we don't see what we need
Won't succeed, please tell me:
Where did we go? Where did we go?

[Verse 2:]
It is so hard
To live this far
What did we do to you?
Yeah

[Chorus:]
We'll try to fly without the wings of mine
We'll die, fragile lives again
We won't proceed in this life
If we don't see what we need
Won't succeed, please tell me:
Where did we go? Where did we go? (whoa)

[Bridge:]
We'll try again some day
Because we love you
We won't forget that day
When love was true (whoa)
We'll try again some day
We love you (whoa)
We won't forget that day
When love was true

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Outro:]
We won’t proceed in this life
If we don’t see what we need
Won’t succeed please tell me:
Where did we go?

[Spoken:]
Why, why is there a phone on the background?
You were flat, man! Flat, man, that was not flat!
I thought you said this was going to be a good song
Where did we go? (Someone get that.)
I thought you said this was going to be a good song, c'mon, seriously
He did say that
