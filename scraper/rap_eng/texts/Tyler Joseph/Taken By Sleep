[Intro]
This is a story about a scarlet letter... yeah

[Verse 1]
It just hit me as I laid my head down
No one around in the dark cold night, I hear a sound
In my head repeat track of everything you've ever said
Must be something, but it's nothing, so I just go back to bed
It's four, crack the door to the hallways in my dreams
But it seems my hallway keeps closing in on me
Forcing me out, making me think about you and how you're gone
I see 4:05 in teary eyes and then I write this song


[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't believe it has to be this way
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day
I saw your face, I saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight
But now it's all being torn down for me tonight

[Chorus]
And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say
But I need to know if you've thought of me at all today
Cause every day walk past the place you lived 5 days of the week
And now it's ten after four and I am taken by sleep

[Verse 2]
Spending hours on end, deciding what I'd say to a friend if I ever saw him again
Cause I don't if I know, don't want to come across the wrong way
And I don't know if I know, but I know I want to see your face today
And somebody told me they saw you cry and break down
Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about?
It's not like you to let emotions get the best of things
Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't believe it has to be this way
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day
I saw your face and saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight
But now it's all being torn down for me tonight

[Chorus]
And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say
But I need to know if you thought of me at all today
Cause every day walk past the place you lived 5 days of the week
And now it's ten after four and I am taken by sleep

[Bridge]
I'll sing a song to you, my friend
I'll sing a song to you, my friend
I'll sing a song to you, my friend
I'll sing a song to you, my... Let's go!

Friend, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll sing a song to you my friend
I'll sing a song to you my friend
I'll sing a song to you my friend
I'll sing a song to you my friend
