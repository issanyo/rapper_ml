[Verse 1]
The young boy wants to move ahead
And the old man sings rewind
I wonder when in this time line
We’ll break to the other side
Maybe there’s a span of time
When we feel we’re neither nor
Not wanting to go back again
And not wanting to go forth

The point in life must be
Pretty dark and hopeless
Terrifying
And if you’re asking me when that is

[Chorus]
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight

[Verse 2]
The old man sits all by himself
And thinks of better years
When he used to believe in stars
And would dream away his fears
The young boy moves so fast he doesn’t
See the stars above
And all his dreams are crushed by old man
Who didn’t dream enough

We must all agree
There’s a point in life when darkness breaks our
Brittle hopes and dreams
And I’d say

[Chorus]
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight

[Bridge]
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight
It must be tonight

Stay with me...

[Outro]
And it must be tonight
It must be tonight
Save me tonight
It must be tonight
