It breaks my heart to see that not posting would lead some of you to believe that I do not love and support you. That is simply not true.
Any day that love defeats hate, you know I am celebrating. just maybe not on twitter.
As for the silence:
Through personal experiences, I want to create and influence something that might help others navigate through the battlefield that is the brain
And for those of you understand that terminology, you know what battle I am talking about
But while I am at this mental ground zero, I have found that any other influence added on, no matter how noble, becomes too heavy for me to carry
I am not strong enough
Be patient with me as I grow, that some day I might be able to carry more weight but for now, I write what I know

Both Josh and I mean this, with Love and Support

Ps. I disliked seeing artists/bands/peers use the lovewins news to sell singles and t-shirts so I shut up
