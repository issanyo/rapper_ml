[Verse 1]
Ruby, I hope I see you
I've waited all this week
For you to walk my way
Your soul will capture me

[Verse 2]
Your mama painted your room
A shade of pink, she said
But with your great arrival
That shade has turned to red

[Chorus]
Ruby, take my hand
Please lead me to the Promised Land
Tell me, where am I from?
Your eyes say, sha-da-dee-da-dum

Ruby, you're royalty
In your homeland, they all call you queen
Tell me, where are you from?
Your eyes say, sha-da-dee-da-dum

You're an angel fallen down
Won't you tell us of the clouds?
You have fallen from the sky
How high, how high
You're an angel fallen down
Won't you tell us of the clouds?
You have fallen from the sky
How high, how high

[Bridge]
You're true and pure
You hold the cure
We're all diseased
You hold the key

[Chorus]
You're an angel fallen down
Won't you tell us of the clouds?
You have fallen from the sky
How high, how high

[Outro]
Tell our dad I'm sorry
Tell our dad I'm sorry
Tell our dad I'm sorry
Tell our dad I'm sorry
Tell our dad I'm sorry
Tell our dad I'm sorry
Tell our dad I'm sorry

You're an angel
You're an angel
You're an angel
You're an angel
You're an angel

Tell our dad I'm sorry
Tell our dad I'm sorry
Tell our dad I'm sorry, yeah

You're an angel, you're an angel
