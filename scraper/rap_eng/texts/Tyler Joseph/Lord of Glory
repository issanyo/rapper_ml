[Intro: Tyler Joseph]
Oh let your roots of love wrestle me, tangle me
God I hate to really lose the fight, But not this time, It's alright

La da da de da
La da da de da

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
Oh let your roots of love wrestle me, tangle me
God I hate to really lose the fight, but not this time, it's alright
I feel your energy working me, building me
Now I've got a new identity, looks like me, but it's unseen

[Chorus: Travis Whittaker]
Jesus you are the Lord of Glory
Jesus you are the Lord of Glory
Jesus you are,
Jesus you are...

La da da de da
La da da de da
La da da de da
La da da de da

[Verse 2: Tyler Joseph]
I hear (I hear) your call (your call)
Raise the gate (raise the gate) lift me up (lift me up)
You took away (you took away) the veil from me (the veil from me)
There's so much light (there's so much light) it's so bright (it's so bright)

[Chorus: Travis Whittaker]
Jesus you are the Lord of Glory
Jesus you are the Lord of Glory
Jesus you are,
Jesus you are

[Bridge: Tyler Joseph & Travis Whittaker]
The light, the light that is burning bright
You're the light, the light that is burning bright
The light, the light that is burning bright
You're the light, the light that is burning

[Chorus: Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph]
Jesus you are the Lord of Glory
Jesus you are the Lord of Glory
Jesus you are,
Jesus you are
