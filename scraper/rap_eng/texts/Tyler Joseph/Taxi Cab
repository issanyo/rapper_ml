[Verse 1]
I wanna fall inside your ghost
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided

[Chorus]
Sometimes we will die
And sometimes we will fly away
Either way, you're by my side
Until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, don't be afraid
I said, don't be afraid
We're going home

[Verse 2]
I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death I've made for you
A mortal rotting piece of song
Will help me carry on
But this you heard

[Chorus]
Sometimes we will die
And sometimes we will fly away
Either way, you're by my side
Until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, don't be afraid
I said, don't be afraid
We're going home

[Verse 3]
So the hearse ran out of gas, a passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab, a beautifully plain taxi cab
A cab, had a cleared out back and two men started to unpack
Driving once again, but now this time there were three men
And then I heard one of them say, "I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade when all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate so he could see another day."
And then I cracked open my box, someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more, pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor and found the breath I was searching for
Then there were three men up front, all I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked them, "Am I alive and well, or am I dreaming dead?"
Then one turned around to say, "We're driving toward the morning sun
Where all your blood is washed away and all you did will be undone."

[Outro]
I said, don't be afraid
I said, don't be afraid
