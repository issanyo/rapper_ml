[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask ya who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don’t know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow

[Verse 1]
Welcome to a room o' people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we checked our guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains can change from hand grenades
You’ll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
You're thinkin', "How'd I get here sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don’t know the half of the abuse

[Verse 2]
We don’t deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
Have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intention
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You’ll never know the murderer sitting next to you
You're thinkin', "How did I get here sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don’t forget

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask ya who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Bridge]
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Outro]
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us
