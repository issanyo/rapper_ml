This is a line and this line is mine
You will kindly find my feet
And my spine are perfectly aligned
You'll also find that on either side
Is a plus and a minus sign
Right now I'm on this line
Minus this, now I'm online

This is a line and this line is mine
You will kindly find my feet
And my spine are on the plus sign
Now I'd like to assign and also define
What one might find on this side of the line
I will not pretend that there are no consequences
Of saying something offensive online
No matter what my ignorant friend says
Cause words are all I have
And yeah I know it's sad
We hide behind the mask
Of the latest social networking fad
So there's respect in my status
Whether through Mark Zuckerberg or Tom
I'll treat you the same in person and yeah
I'll accept your friend request, mom

This is a line and this line is mine
You will kindly find my feet
And my spine are on the minus sign
Now I'd like to assign and also define
What one might find on this side of the line
Now I might seem unassuming
But if you only knew what I was doing
Brewing, spewing, spitting venom
When I'm at that screen, I ruin
Reputations I will splatter
Typing faster I get madder
All the insults I will gather
You're so lucky it's only Saturday
You have one day, oh yes, Sunday
For my words to die away
And on that one day, I must say
You're going to wish you had a different name
But then it's Monday and at school
I remind them all of what I said
Then it's Tuesday, then it's Wednesday
Then we'll all find out you're dead

This is a line and this line is mine
And now that I have assigned
What one might find on either side
You will kindly find that my feet
And my spine are on the plus sign
And I'm not moving
Where are you?
