[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, my catastrophe
I'm a kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me
Okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless
Then paint something, and it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons, meaning
Maybe defeating them could be the beginning of your meaning, friend

[Chorus: Tyler]
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game and say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say they don't know you
And neither do I, so here's a prime example of a stand up guy who
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother, and his head's screwed up, but that's all right

[Bridge: Zack Joseph]
Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moments mending memories
Pretending enemies are frenemies, sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am but I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gambling man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

[Chorus: Tyler]
Go away, go away, go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone

[Outro: Tyler]
Leave me alone
Don't leave me alone
