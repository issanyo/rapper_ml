[Chorus]
Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best
Of sons, hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind
And I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of you
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water

[Bridge]
Water, oh, oh

[Verse]
I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I try my best in all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just being dramatic, in fact
I'm only at it again as an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind, as it blows me back and forth
Mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a "crazy, suicidal head" case
But you specialize in dying, you hear me screaming, "Father!"
And I'm lying here just crying, so wash me with your water

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, water

[Chorus]
Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best
Of sons, hello, I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind
And I, I haven't found a drop of life
I haven't found a drop of you
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop of water
