[Verse 1: David McCreary]
I told my mom don't be a bore
Please just ride my hoverboard
You won't fall I promise you
You just have to trust me

[Verse 2: Tyler Joseph and David McCreary]
I told my mom don't be a bore
Please just ride my hoverboard
You won't fall I promise you
You just have to trust me

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph and David McCreary]
I know you have told me time and time again
To shut my freaking trap
And just get off your back
(Alright Dave)

[Verse 3: David McCreary]
Just hold my hand and you'll be fine
And think I do this all the time (everyday)
I've had this thing for just one day
But everything will be okay (yes it will)

[Verse 4: David McCreary and Tyler Joseph]
She said Tyler there's no way
You'll ever get me on that thing
And why's it called a hoverboard
Those wheels are still touching the floor

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph and David McCreary]
I know you have told me time and time again
To shut my freaking trap
And just get off your back
(Alright... Bring it away Dave, come on now)

[Verse 5: David McCreary and Tyler Joseph]
Now here she goes, she's on the board
I let go she hit the floor
Man that escalated quick
When she screamed: Tyler you're an idiot

[Explanation]

(Tyler Joseph)
And I was like "Mom, I was right behind you, I told you: let me know when you get off. I said... I told my mom, I was like: let me know when you get off and I'll help you get off, and she just tried to get off and it happened so fast...

(David McCreary)
Ok! That's alright!

(Tyler Joseph)
It's like: one second she was there and one second she was on the ground right in front of me.

(David McCreary)
But she's fine!

(Tyler Joseph)
And she said "How am I gonna cook Christmas dinner?" and I was like... she said "Tyler, you're gonna have to cook Christmas dinner... Dave, I can't cook... I can't cook Christmas dinner...

(David McCreary)
Alright!... She's gonna... She's gonna heal, she's young...ish, she'll be fine...
So, I just feel like we need to finish and let people know what happened, okay?

(Tyler Joseph)
Okay. Let me find the chord....

(David McCreary)
Okay. Have you played this thing before?

(Tyler Joseph)
Yeah, I just found it.

[Verse 6: Tyler Joseph and David McCreary]
She broke her wrist it's all my/his fault
An unexpected somersault
There she lies in total pain
Yours should not look that way

[Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
I know she has told me time and time again
Even after what I did
I'm still her favorite kid
