[Verse 1]
Open the slits in your face and start your day
You don't have much time to make your slits look just right
I'm in your mind
I'm singing
I'm in your mind

[Chorus]
I'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da-da

[Verse 2]
Look in the mirror and ask your soul if you're alright
Put on the glitter that your soul hides behind
You're in my mind
I'm singing
You're in my mind

[Chorus]
I'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da-da

[Bridge]
Know you were made holy
Open up your eyes and see
The clouds above will hold you
The clouds above will sing

[Outro]
And in your mind
You're singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da-da
