[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

[Verse 1]
This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

[Verse 2]
In City, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

[Bridge]
Folina, Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina, Sahlo

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito (Sahlo)
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

[Outro]
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina
