[Verse 1]
We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

[Chorus]
Cause I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice

[Verse 2]
What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
I don't want to know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

[Chorus]
Cause I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice
I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice

Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh no
No no no no no
