[Verse 1]
You once were oh-so-close
But I don't remember
Where you are and who you know
But come this September
You will fly on your own
Cause you got a letter
You must find, find your home
And it won't get much better

[Chorus]
I try so hard
To fly but my heart
Won't go very far
No, no
And my own two hands
Will start bleeding again
And floor will turn to
To a hole in the ground

[Verse 2]
The plans that I make, roads that I take
Break to holes that will go where I don't know, they
Are solid grounds illusions that write themselves off
As perfectly normal solutions
Pollution's in my eyes
My disguise will take me, break me
Won't save me this time
There's a vision, but you won't save me this time
My decision for living isn't mine to decide and
You just seem oh-so-far
Past the stars and past my heart
I can almost feel you and I start
To close my eyes and sing a song
I will keep singing cause I'm wrong
But you were singing with me all along

[Chorus]
I try so hard
To fly
But my heart
Won't go very far
No, no
And my own two hands
Will start bleeding again
And floor will turn to
To a hole in the ground

[Outro]
Do not be alarmed
If I fall into the sun
If I fall
And my own two hands will start bleeding
And then they will lower me
In to, to a hole in the ground
