[Chorus]

(Down)
We're going down
(Down)
We're going down
(Down)
It takes a sound
To break 'em down

[Verse 1]

Have you ever heard the outside calling?
Have you ever heard the trees singing their song?
Have you ever tasted a ray of Sun?
And have you ever held the Moon's glow?

Why do I feel scared in the morning?
The Sun's up and everybody's moving on
And maybe we all feel alone
Even though we have our telephone

[Refrain]

And we destroy a part of us
Every time we blink an eye
And now its time for all of us
To know that we're going...

[Chorus]
(Down)
We're going down
We're going down
(Down)
It takes a sound
To break 'em down

[Verse 2]

(Alright, let's go)
Normality
Conformity
Stillness, fake faith and forgery
All seem to be a major key
To why the day today will seem
To be a melting dream
That we once had
But now the dream is weak
But now that we all see
That we have fallen down
We just might be
Alive and able to prescribe the reason why we cry
A means to an end then we die
Fall just to fly
Fly 'cause we're free
Free 'cause I know I've seen the end of me
So we
Need to know that we are going down
To seize our crowns
And everybody here will sing a sound
We once were lost
But now we're found

[Refrain]

And we destroy a part of us
Every time we blink an eye
And now its time for all of us
To know that we're going

Down
Down

[Verse 3]

Have you ever tasted a ray of Sun?
And have you ever held the Moon's glow?
Why do I feel scared in the morning?
The Sun's up and everybody's moving on
(Down)
We're going down
We're going down

[Chorus]

We’re going down
We’re going down
It takes a sound
To break ‘em down

(Down)
We’re going down
We’re going down
(Down)
It takes a sound
To break ‘em down

[Outro]

Have you ever heard the outside calling?
Have you ever heard the trees singing their song?
Have you ever tasted a ray of Sun?
And have you ever held the Moon's glow?
