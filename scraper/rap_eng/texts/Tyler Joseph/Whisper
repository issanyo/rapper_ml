A song is not much time to show
How beautiful you are
But I will sing a song to your heart

A brave man said "You put a name to a song"
And it won't change no matter what goes wrong
I'll try my best to find a face and a name
I'll sing until we both are one and the same

I don't know what I should give
Or what I'm to sing
All I can do is give you this
And let my heart play

Didn't have much time to see why I was found
Had to say goodbye as time ran out
Sail across the world
Just to find a pearl
On the other side
Hope the pearl won't forget this song
And won't forget the sky

I don't know what I should give
Or what I'm to sing
All I can do is give you this
And let my heart play
I know your face
Let this song whisper your name

A song is not much time to show
How beautiful you are
But I will sing a song to your heart

I don't know what I should give
Or what I'm to sing
All I can do is give you this
And let my heart play
I know your face
Let this song whisper your name

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Oh

I don't know what I should give
Or what I'm to sing
All I can do is give you this
And let my heart play
I know your face
Let this song whisper your name
