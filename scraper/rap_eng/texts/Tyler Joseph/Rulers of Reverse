[Verse 1: Travis Whittaker]
You showed how to serve to be rulers of reverse
To be last not first
You have back Your might, showed us love inside a fight
Laying Your rights down (Rights down)

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Whittaker]
You're so beautiful
My eyes are open now
You're so beautiful
I just can't contain this sound
You're so beautiful
My heart is screamin' now
You're so beautiful

[Chorus: Travis Whittaker, Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph]
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful

[Verse 2: Travis Whittaker, Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph]
Like the birds of the air
To be careless in His care
Letting worry die
You took up Your cross
There is victory in loss
You gave all to save
You gave grace away
And now it's all okay

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph]
You're so beautiful
My eyes are open now
You're so beautiful
I just can't contain this sound
You're so beautiful
My heart is screamin' now
You're so beautiful

[Chorus: Travis Whittaker, Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph]
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful

[Bridge: Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph, Travis Whittaker]
So here's my life
Let it shine
Let it shine
God let it shine
So here's my life
Use it now 'cause I've been turned upside down
So here's my life
Let it shine
Let it shine
God let it shine
So here's my life
Use it now 'cause I've been turned upside down

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler Joseph]
You're so beautiful
My eyes are open now
You're so beautiful
I just can't contain this sound
You're so beautiful
My heart is screamin' now
You're so beautiful

[Outro: Travis Whittaker]
You're so beautiful
My eyes are open now
You're so beautiful
I just can't contain this sound
You're so beautiful
My heart is screamin' now
You're so beautiful
