[Verse 1]
I feel for you, but when did you believe you were alone?
You say that spiders crawled inside
And made themselves a home where light once was
Petrified of who you are and who you have become
You will hide from everyone
Denying you need someone to exterminate your bones

[Chorus]
Friend, please remove your hands from over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
But friend, please don't take your life away from me

[Verse 2]
Living like a ghost, you walk by everyone you know
You say that you're fine, but you have lost your sway and glow
So I stopped by to let you know

[Chorus]
Friend, please remove your hands from over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
But friend, please don't take your life away from me

[Bridge]
Would you let me know your plans tonight?
Cause I just won't let go 'til we both see the light
And I have nothing else left to say
But I will listen to you all day
Yes, I will

[Outro]
Friend, please remove your hands from over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
But friend, please don't take your life away from me
