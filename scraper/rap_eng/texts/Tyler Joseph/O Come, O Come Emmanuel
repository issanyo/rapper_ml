[Intro: David McCreary]
Coming to the stage now
Is our new singer, first time on television, though you've probably heard of him
He is the president of the Doris Day fan club
Actually I hear that Sinatra has a restraining order against him
Please, help me welcome him to the stage, Tyler Joseph

[Tyler Joseph]
Oh no, no

[Verse 1]
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

No, no
Oh no

[Verse 2]
O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no, no

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

[Outro: David McCreary & Tyler Joseph]
Tyler Jefferson everybody, round of applause
Wow, that was dark
That was dark
You do realise that it's Christmas
The carol's great
Carol is great, but so is Betty but she doesn't make me want to cry
I hear you're going on tour
Yeah, my band and I
Oh your band, let me stop you right there
Elvis never needed a band
I'm not Elvis
You didn't need to tell me twice
Tyler Rae-Jepsen everybody
Thank you, so Merry Christmas Tyler
Get off the stage
Ma, I'm tryna
Bring back Tyler, he's got something, am I right
