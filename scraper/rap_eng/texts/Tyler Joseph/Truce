[Verse 1]
Now the night is coming to an end, ooh
The sun will rise and we will try again, ooh

[Chorus]
Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die

[Verse 2]
I will fear the night again, ooh
I hope I'm not my only friend, ooh

[Chorus]
Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die
