[Verse 1]
You're scared when you say
You talked to them today
When asked your faith
You'll cry, no sound
Wipe the tears with your doubts
And die again

[Chorus]
I can't sleep, it's just takin' time off my feet
But my head instead is going a hundred miles a beat
And I'm thinkin' as I'm sinkin'
And he's winkin' at me
'Cause they know the desperation and temptation is free
Do you see?
I can't live this way
Just to write a song to play
Just to stay alive
Just enough to breathe away
Another day, another face
And I will lose another race
Save me now
'Cause tomorrow's gone just like yesterday

[Verse 2]
They laugh in your face
'Cause they took your grace
But did you give it away, oh, yeah
They cry no sound
Wipe the tears with your doubts
And die again

[Verse 3]
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
And the meaning and weight of the day is lost without a trace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes only because we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling out there's somethin' else in this world that we need
And it happens to be free

[Bridge]
I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
He is strong
And I'll live another day
I'll live another day
I'll live another day
He is strong
And I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
He is strong
And I'll live another day
I'll live another day
I'll live

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't sleep, it's just takin' time off my feet
But my head instead is going a hundred miles a beat
And I'm thinkin' as I'm sinkin'
And he's winkin' at me
'Cause they know the desperation and temptation is free
Do you see?
We can't live this way
Just to write a song to play
Just to stay alive
Just enough to breathe away
Another day, another face
And I will lose another race
Save me now
'Cause tomorrow's gone just like yesterday
