This is a line and this line is mine
You will kindly find my feet and my spine
Are perfectly aligned
You will also find that on either side is a plus and a minus sign

Right now I'm on this line
Minus this and now I'm online

This is a line and this line is mine
You will kindly find my feet and my spine
Are on the plus sign

Now, I'd like to assign and also define
What one might find on this side of the line

I will not pretend that
There are no consequences
Of saying something offensive online
No matter what my ignorant friend says
Cause words are all I have
And yeah, I know it's sad
We hide behind the mask of
The latest social networking fad
So there's respect in my status
Whether through Mark Zuckerberg or Tom
And I'll treat you the same in person
And yeah, I'll accept your friend request, mom

This is a line and this line is mine
You will kindly find my feet and my spine
Are on the minus sign

Now, I'd like to assign and also define
What one might find on this side of the line

Now, I might seem unassuming
But if you only knew what I was doing
Brewing, spewing, spitting venom
When I'm at that screen I ruin
Reputations I will splatter
Typing faster I get madder
All the insults I will gather
You're so lucky it's only Satur...day
You have one day, oh yes,
Sunday, for my words to die away
And on that one day, oh, I must say
You're gonna wish you had a different name

But then it's Monday and at school
I will remind them all of what I said
Then it's Tuesday
Then it's Wednesday
Then we'll all find out, you're dead

This is a line and this line is mine
And now that I've assigned
What one might find on either side
You will kindly find that my feet and my spine
Are on the plus sign
And I'm not moving

Where are you?
