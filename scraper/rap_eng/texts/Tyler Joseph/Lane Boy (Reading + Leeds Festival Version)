[Intro]
Why
Do I kneel to these concepts
Tempted by control
Controlled by temptation
Temptation
"Stay low" they say
"Stay low"

[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 1]
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way, we’d have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our mind’s changed on what we think is good
I wasn’t raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn’t for this music I don’t know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I’m hearing are so heartless
Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless, honest
There’s a few songs on this record that feel common
I’m in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity’s only free when I’m playing shows

[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Verse 2]
I’m sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He’s my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's backtrack
Back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list?
But the problem is, there’s another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You’re gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I’m hearing are so heartless
Sing
(Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless)

[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[Interlude]
Give me both hands up
Put them down in front of you, and grab someone's shoulders in front of you
And on the count of 3 you're going to bring them down to the ground and we're going to get down as low as we can
Ready, 1
2
3
Get down low
Are you ready, are you ready let's go
1, 2, 3 GO
(But will they be alive tomorrow)
Woo
Woo

Jump (x15)

[Chorus]
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
