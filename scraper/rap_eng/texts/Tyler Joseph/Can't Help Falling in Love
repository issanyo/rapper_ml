[Verse]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

[Chorus]
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life, too
Cause I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life, too
Cause I can't help falling in love with you
Cause I can't help falling in love with you

But I can't help falling in love with you
