[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I’ll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you’re a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
(Take me with you)

[Bridge]
(We’re gonna rely pretty heavily
On technology
And energy
To cover up the fact that we’re only two people
But I think we can do it)

No, I don't know which way I’m going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I’m going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
But I can hear my way around

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
(Don't believe the hype)
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
