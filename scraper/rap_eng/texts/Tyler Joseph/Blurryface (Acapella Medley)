My name's Blurry face and I care what you think,
My name's Blurry face and I care what you think,
My name's Blurry face and I care what you think,
My name's Blurry face and I care what you think,

Verse 1 (Heavydirtysoul)
There’s an infestation in my mind’s imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke cause I’m smoking them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
Cause I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t rushing to saying nothing
This doesn’t mean I lost my dream
It’s just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don’t cry
Therefore, therefore I’m Mr. Misty-eyed, therefore I’m

Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me,
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me,
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save my
heavydirtysoul
heavydirtysoul

Verse 2 (Lane Boy)
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say, "Stay in your lane, lane boy, lane, lane boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

Verse 3 (Fairly Local/Hometown)
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, Yeah.
Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark

Verse 4 (Message Man)
A loser hides behind
A mask of my disguise
And who I am today
Is worse than other times

You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial
That they tried this suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message, man
These lyrics aren't for everyone
Only few understand

Verse 5 (Tear in My Heart)
You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
That you’re alive and have a soul, oh, oh
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been

Verse 6 (Doubt/ Not Today)
Eh, eh, eh, eh,
Eh, eh, eh, eh,
Don't forget about me no, oh
Eh, eh, eh, eh,
Eh, eh, eh, eh,
Don't forget about me no, oh

You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seeing my side, oh
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Verse 7 (We Don't Believe What's on TV)
I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here, oh
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice


Verse 8 (The Judge)
Nah-nah-nah-nah, ooh-oh
Nah-nah-nah-nah, ooh-oh
You're the judge, Oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, Oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, Oh no
Josh Dun
You're the judge, Oh no
Set me free


Verse 9 (Polarize/Ride)
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me
My friends and I have problems,
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me
My friends and I have problems,

I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much
(I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much
Help me
I've been thinking too much
(I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much

Oh Oh Ohh Oh Oh Ohh I'm falling
So I'm taking my time on my ride Oh Oh Ohh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time

Verse 10 (Stressed Out)
We used to play pretend,
Used to play pretend honey,
Used to play pretend
"Wake up ya need the money"
We used to play pretend,
Used to play pretend honey,
Used to play pretend
"Wake up ya need the money"
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face
Singing "wake up, you need to make money", yeah

Verse 11 (Goner)
Though I'm weak
And beaten down
I'll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I'm inside out
You're underneath

Don’t let me be gone
Don’t let me be gone
Don't let me be!

I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I'm a goner
Somebody catch my breath
I wanna be known by you
I wanna be known by you
