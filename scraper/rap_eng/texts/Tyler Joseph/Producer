[Verse 1: Travis Whittaker]
When You show Your fist with an open hand
And reveal Your truth through loneliness
May Your presence find them, shy like lambs
Would You catch them, catch them in Your arms
In Your arms

[Verse 2: Travis Whittaker]
When You break their heart by sight
As they watch their idols ignite
When the fear is all they see
Then will You catch them as they believe?

[Chorus: Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph]
Make them cry out
Make them cry out
Make them cry out
Make them cry out

[Verse 3: Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph, Travis Whittaker]
When You shake their mind to see Your grave
That is meant for them, You've risen to save
Oh, to see them reaching out for change
Would You catch them, catch them today?

[Chorus: Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph, Travis Whittaker]
Make them cry out
God, make them cry out
Make them cry out
Make them cry out

[Bridge: Travis Whittaker & Tyler Joseph, Tyler Joseph, Travis Whittaker]
