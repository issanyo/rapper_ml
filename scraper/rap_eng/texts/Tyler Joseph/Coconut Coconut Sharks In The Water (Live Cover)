[Chorus]
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water. frens

[Verse 1]
First verse, okay so what I got here is I got Chris Salih
You guys remember him he used to be the drummer of twenty one pilots
He’s got a verse for ya, let’s hear it out
1,2 1,2,3,4

Glad to be back here on stage again
Singing this song with all my frens
It seems like I’ve been gone so long
But I really haven’t been gone that long… um
I’m glad cause’ these jackets are really lame
You guys think that’s really your ticket to fame?
I had to quit the band for other things, but that’s kinda depressing
SO LETS ALL SING!

[Chorus]
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
Let’s sing it again, c’mon you can do it!
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens

[Verse 2]
waka baka buka doka buka noka me
waka laka waka laka waka laka you
Snowboarding in Hawaii
surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, surfing on the beach, Hawaii, (yep) Hawaii (Hawaii)
This song sounds like something- AGAIN TO THE CHORUS

[Chorus]
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens

[Verse 3]
My name is not Josh and you don’t know who I am
But I live with these guys and their really stupid band
But my breath fogged up the glass
So I drew a face and I laughed
So I won’t hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I’m yours
TO THE CHORUS!

[Chorus]
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
We’re doing it one more time, ready?
Let’s make it count
Here we go
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water
Coconut coconut sharks in the water, frens
