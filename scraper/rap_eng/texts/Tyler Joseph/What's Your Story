This is a line and this line is mine
You will kindly find my feet and my spine are perfectly aligned
You'll also find that on either side is a plus and a minus sign
Right now I'm on this line minus this
Now I'm online
This a line and this line is mine, you will kindly find my feet and spine are on the plus sign
Now I like to assign and also define what one might find on this side of the line
I will not pretend that there are no consequences of saying
Something offensive online no matter what my ignorant friend says
Cause words are all I have and yeah I know it's sad
We hide behind the mask of the latest social networking fad
So there's respect in my status whether through Mark Zuckerberg or Tom
And I'll treat you the same in person
And yeah, I'll accept your friend request, Mom
This is a line and this line is mine
You will kindly find my feet and my spine are on the minus sign
Now i'd like to assign and also define what one might find on this side of the line
Now I might seem unassuming but if you only knew what I was doing, brewing, spewing, spitting venom
When I'm at that screen I ruin reputations will splatter
Typing faster I get madder
All the insults I will gather
You're so lucky it's only Satur-day
You have one day
Oh yes, Sunday for my words to die away
And on that one day though I must say you're gonna wish you had and a different name
But then it's Monday and at school
I'll remind them all of what I said
Then it's Tuesday
Then it's Wednesday
And we'll all find out you're dead
This is a line and this is my line
And now that I've assigned what one might find on either side
You will kindly find my feet and my spine are on the plus sign
And I'm not moving
Where are you?
