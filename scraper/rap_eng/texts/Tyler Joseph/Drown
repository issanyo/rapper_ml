[Intro: Future Of The Purple]
Here I come, come to You in the very clothes
That I killed, killed You in and now I know I’m alone

[Chorus: Future Of The Purple]
I walk to you, rain falls from you
Can You wash me, can You drown me?

[Verse 1: Tyler Joseph]
I wanna be a lot of things, so much pent up inside of me
I wanna be stronger, too long I’ve sat here undecidedly
Planning strategy, half of me know it’s all just a fallacy
Failing miserably, drastically and then I crash dramatically
Into a wall I’ve hit a hundred times before
And yet I still ignore the dark red blood stains on the floor
And I’m back in front of You, Lord, with the blood on the floor
Is the blood mine or yours? Don’t wanna do this anymore
Back and forth between bein' me and who You call me to be
You see a man free who thinks he has to buy a key
To a door but he can’t ‘cause he’s poor and he can’t
Fall down anymore ‘cause he’s already on the floor
And his heart is broken and all and this is his scar
But it’s warm from cryin' ‘cause he will try nine times
To realize nine crimes but he has more than nine lives
So he picks himself up and keeps fightin' for the prize again

[Pre-Chorus: Future Of The Purple]
Here I come again to You
Just to show the blood soaked through
Through my bones and all I own
Is there a way for me to know?

[Chorus: Future Of The Purple]
I walk to you, rain falls from you
Can You wash me, can You drown me?

[Verse 2]
Every time I feel selfish ambition is takin' my vision
My crime is my sentence, repentance is takin' commission
It’s takin' a toll on my soul, I’m screamin' submission and
I don’t know if I am dyin' or livin'
‘Cause I will save a face for the name of sake
Abuse grace, take a aim to obtain a new name in a newer place
But my name is lame, I can’t walk and I ain’t the same
And my name, I became a new destiny to the grave and
They say the ocean’s blue but it’s black right now
In the dark, on the sand, lookin' out at my crowd
Depression and drownin', singin' now the full parts
Of lightning reveals where the ocean stops and the sky starts
I’ve been told by the sky that the ocean I shall win
But it’s hard for me to see where ocean stops, and sky begins
A random strike of light reminds me of what is true
But right now the ocean is blacker than black, the sky is too (Is too)
