There’s an infestation in my mind’s imagination
I hope they choke on smoke cause I’m smoking them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
Cause I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t rushing to say nothing
This doesn’t mean I lost my dream
It’s just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean
Know what I mean?

No, I didn’t understand a thing you said
If I didn’t know better, I'd guess you’re all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like, “you only live once"
Yeah, once
You got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now

Because death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
