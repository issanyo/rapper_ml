[Verse 1]
You know I can't take one more step towards you
‘Cause all that's waiting is regret
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore?
You lost the love I loved the most

[Pre-Chorus]
I learned to live, half-alive
Now you want me one more time

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

[Verse 2]
I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
I learned to live, half-alive
Now you want me one more time

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

[Bridge]
It took so long just to feel alright
You remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
‘Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

[Outro]
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think...
You are?
