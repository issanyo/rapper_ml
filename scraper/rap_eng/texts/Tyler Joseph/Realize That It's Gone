[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I could sing and I could dance
With a perfect mind
And I would always take a chance
But now I realize that today is different
It is so different than yesterday
There was a place
When I could sing this song
A perfect song
When nothing could go wrong
And now the place that I am
It is so different
It is so different
Yeah

[Chorus]
I tried to sing a song for you
And now I realize that it's gone
I tried to live my life for you
And now I realize that it's gone
(I realize that it's gone)
(I realize that it's gone)
(I realize that it's gone)
(I realize that it's gone)

[Verse 2]
I loved but now I run away
I lived but now I see the day
As just another desperate way
To change the way I'm living today
The love you see inside of me
Is not mine but it comes from the only
God that will let you live your life
And now I don't have to change

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You say that you can save the day (save the day)
So hear me when I say
Come on down and save me now

You say that you can take what's gone
And turn it into a song
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
