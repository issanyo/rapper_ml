[Verse 1]
Oh, lights are shining down, but
I feel dead
The sickly sweet holidays keep
Me in bed

[Chorus 1]
But when I'm awake
I'm crying every day
I wish that you were here
When Christmas comes this time each year

[Verse 2]
I'll wrap you up and send you
To myself (send you to myself)
I don't want anything from
Anyone else

[Chorus 2]
I'm sitting in my room
Dreaming of you
I can't wait 'til you get here
When Christmas comes this time each year
Yeah yeah!

[Piano solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm feeling better since you
Returned my calls, so
String up some Christmas lights let's
Deck these halls

[Verse 3]
I've one more thing to say
Don't ever go away
Oh, I'm glad you're here
When Christmas comes this time each year

[Outro]
Yeah
Oh oh, oh woah
Ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da
Ba da da, ba da da
