[Pre-Chorus]
My name's BLURRYFΛCE and I care what you think
My name's BLURRYFΛCE and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, I'd probably only sell one
To my brother, cause we have the same nose, same clothes, home grown, stone's throw from where we used to roam
It would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we would all take the latter

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

[Bridge]
Used to play pretend, give each other different names, we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying "wake up, you need to make money"
We used to play pretend, give each other different names, we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, now they're laughing at our face saying "wake up, you need to make money"
"Wake up you need to make money"

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

[Outro]
We're stressed out
We're stressed out
