[Verse 1]
I won't take much of your time
I just want you to see
What I have made inside these lines
It's as good as I can be
It's as good as I can be
This is all that I can be
This is all that I can be
All that I can be

[Chorus 1]
Head tilted down, knees on the ground
And I will ask, "Please, SAVE! Save me.  Please, save, SAVE!  Save, save, save, save, save, save.  Save, save, save me, save me, save me, save me."

[Verse 2]
I deserve for you to turn away
I was ashamed to speak your name
I can't believe that all you see is
That you have covered me gracefully
You're all that I want to be
You're all that I want to be
You're all I'll ever need
You're all I'll ever need

[Chorus 2]
Jesus, please SAVE me! Please, save, SAVE! Save, save, save, save, save, save.  Save, save, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me

[Outro]
I won't take much of your time
Just enough for you to save me
