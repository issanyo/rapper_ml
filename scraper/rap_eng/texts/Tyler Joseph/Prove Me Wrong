I  don’t know
Where I’m supposed to go
So I might just
Take my pride and go
Some people, they know, know everything
But I know that they don't know my heart

Cause I believe in love
And I hope I can show you what I mean
And I don't believe love's for me
So won't you come around and prove me wrong

Cause I, oh yeah I
Believe in love
And I hope I can show you what I mean
And I don’t believe love’s for me
So won’t you come around and prove me wrong

Won’t walk the world
Any different
And my path won’t change until you
Make a wall and make me fall
And break me down

I don’t know, I don’t know
If I wrote this song in vain
(In vain, in vain, in vain)

I, oh yeah I
Believe in love
And I hope I can show you what I mean
And I don’t believe love’s for me
So won’t you come around and prove me wrong
(Prove me wrong, yeah)

You don’t know me
And I don’t know you
Tell me why should I
Do oh...

So won't you come around and prove me wrong
