[Intro]
Ay, yuh
It's Big Baller B
Back here with another freestyle
This one is gon' be over twenty one pilots', "Levitate"
Alright, let's go

[Verse 1]
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Grrat

[Verse 2]
Sometimes quiet is violent, I find it hard to hide it
(This is not rap, this is not hip-hop, just another attempt to make the voices stop)
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

[Chorus]
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Brr, ay, Big Baller B, ay, bars

[Verse 3]
I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know why we're here
Oh my, too deep - please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There's things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two

[Bridge Interlude]
And three cheers to-
Oh, is the song over?
Oh, wait. No, wait
Uh... welcome to Trench
Pull up on yo' sister

Grrat

[Outro]
Pull up on yo' sister, ay
I'm the one who kissed her, ay
Big Baller B
