I feel for you but when did you believe you were alone
You say that spiders crawled inside and made themselves a home
Where light once was
Petrified of who you are and who you have become
You will hide from everyone denying you need someone
To exterminate your bones

Friend, please remove your hands from over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but friend, please don't take your life from me

Won't you let me know your plans tonight
Cause I just won't let go 'til we both see the light
And I have nothing else I have to say
But I will listen to you all day, yes I will

Friend, please remove your hands from over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave but friend, please don't take your life away from me
