[Hook: Tyler Joseph]
Ever wonder what it feels like
In a dollhouse
In a dollhouse
Something just doesn't feel right
In a dollhouse
In a dollhouse

[Verse 1: Jocef]
Cause that's kind of shady
Nora, you're doing too much miss lady
But you can keep a secret I won't tell
But if you don't pay him back
In the form of letter, mail
Hubby's gon know it all
The truth as well
You and the doc got feelings for each other
Drama for real
I'm dressed in stockings
Take heel when you flaunt it
Should be seen in movie reels, while your spouse is ill
For real?

[Hook: Tyler Joseph]
Ever wonder what it feels like
In a dollhouse
In a dollhouse
Something just doesn't feel right
In a dollhouse
In a dollhouse

[Verse 2: Tyler Joseph]
A dollhouse to me is
The worst place to be
Especially if Torvald Helmer is suffocating me
So I'm here to repeat my main man Jocef
As we put to a beat
This tragic story
But please mister theatre teacher don't you comprehend
That the pretty Mrs. Linde and Krogstad are just friends
And old man Dr. Rank must be on the smelly dank
Ms. Nora he likes to spank
And this rhyme is over, thank you

[Outro: Jocef & Tyler Joseph]
Jocef: Something just don't feel right dawg
Jocef: Look at me
Tyler Joseph: Look at me
Jocef: I'm sitting, I'm sitting in a dollhouse
Tyler Joseph: Theatre
Jocef: '09
Tyler Joseph: Pow
Jocef: Deuces
