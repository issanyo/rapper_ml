[Verse 1: CC]
I'm sure you've heard his voice a hundred and fourteen times now
And wished him away forever
And tore yourself apart thinking about what he said
I know I shouldn't say his name here, but

[Chorus: CC]
I don't wanna listen to his voice say what he does
I don't wanna listen to it echoing in my head
The yellow comes back and it tells me, "don't listen to him, stay alive, please"
I won't listen to his voice say what it does

[Verse 2: CC]
Once again I step inside my shoes
A battle now for every single thing I do
And I don't care because I don't have a clue
I seem to close all the windows in my room
That tell me how I am comfortable inside this broken, tainted, skin that I'm in
I can't win
I need you to break me up, break me down to the sound
So I can pray that nobody else falls down, and

[Chorus: CC]
I don't wanna listen to his voice say what he does
I don't wanna listen to it echoing in my head
The yellow comes back and it tells me, "don't listen to him, stay alive, please"
I won't listen to his voice say what it does

[Bridge: CC]
The yellow, don't listen, it tells me, don't listen
The yellow, don't listen, it tells me, don't listen
The yellow, don't listen, it tells me, don't listen
The yellow, don't listen, it tells me, because

[Chorus: CC]
I don't wanna listen to his voice say what he does
I don't wanna listen to it echoing in my head
The yellow comes back and it tells me, "don't listen to him, stay alive, please"
I won't listen to his voice say what it does
I won't listen to his voice say what it does
I won't listen to his voice say

[Outro]
