Roof is (falling) let me love m' (falling)

You used to, you used to
You used to call me on my

Hello, it's me (Gold up in my teeth)
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet (I missed you in the basement)
To go over everything (cell phone)
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Panda, panda

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt

They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

I know when that hotline bling

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times

Come to you river

I will come to your river
(Wash my soul)
I will come to your river
(Wash my soul again)

He said me haffi (Come to your river)
Work, work, work, work, work, work
He said me haffi
Work, work, work, work, work, work
He see me do mi
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt (Wash my soul again)

E di qe ti don don, don

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, I put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long

Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di dance
Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di' dance

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight (Nique les clones)
Baby I don't (Wish we could turn back time)
To have fun tonight (To the good old days)

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Cause it's our time to go
Dance with me one more time

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

Dance with me one more time

Light it up ! (Panda)

Je ne vois plus que des clones, ça a commencé à l'école
À qui tu donnes de l'épaule pour t'en sortir ?

Ooohe
Makeba, makeba ma che bella
Can I get a ooohe
Makeba, makes my body dance for you (Sapés)
Ooohe

On n'est pas des codes barres
T'as la cote sur les réseaux puis ta cote part
On n'est pas des codes barres
T'as la cote sur les réseaux puis ta cote part
Le regard des gens t'amènera devant le mirage du miroir
Mais, moi, j'ai la rage, ma vision du Rap, elle est rare
Tant qu'un misérable s'endormira dans la rame
Pendant que le rat se réchauffera sur les rails

Can't stop the feeling !
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
So just dance dance dance dance

9-3 c'est la Champions League
9-3 c'est la Champions (I need a one dance)
9-3 c'est la Champions League
9-3 c'est la Champions League (Paw paw paw paw)

Baby (baby) I like your style

We might die for this shit (La dalle)
We might die for this shit (La dalle)

Just dance dance dance dance

I can't feel my face when I (Just dance dance dance dance)
I can't feel my face when I (Just dance dance dance dance)

Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation
