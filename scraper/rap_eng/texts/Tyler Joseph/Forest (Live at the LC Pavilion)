[Intro]
Speaking of "Back in the day," the boys would now like to show you some of their older songs if that's alright with all of you

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's stomach inside my brain
I don't wanna be heard, I wanna be listened to
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream, you scream
We all scream, 'cause we're terrified
O' what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives
So let's think of somethin' better

[Chorus]
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singin' songs that nobody wrote

[Verse 2]
My brain has given up, white flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought, it might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain throws up onto the page
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream, you scream
We all scream, 'cause we're terrified
O' what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't wanna lose our lives
So let's think of somethin' better

[Chorus]
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singin' songs that nobody wrote

[Bridge]
Quickly movin' towards the storm, movin' forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everythin' I adore
Takes a different form when I squints my eyes
Have you ever done that? When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?
This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me?
I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom, or swingin' on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
The situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned

[Chorus]
Come on!
Down in the forest, we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singin' songs that nobody wrote

[Outro]
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
