And I, I tried to sing for you
I tried to live for you
I tried to keep the truth
Oh yeah, I, I failed to sing for you
I failed to live for you
I failed to keep the truth

I want to know
(People look at him and think that-)
I want to see
(-he will live his life so perfectly but what they don't know-)
I want to be with you when I am weak
(-is he wants to die
Because the only reason why you think his life is clear
Is because he knows that he will never understand)
[Repeat]

I tried to sing for you
I tried to live for you
I tried to keep the truth
But I failed to sing for you
I failed to live for you

I want to know
I want to see
I want to be with you
When I am weak

I want to know
(People look at him and think that-)
I want to see
(-he will live his life so perfectly but what they don't know-)
I want to be with you when I am weak
(-is he wants to die
Because the only reason why you think his life is clear
Is because he knows that he will never understand)

Again? Sure

I want to know
I want to see
I want to be with you
When I am weak
