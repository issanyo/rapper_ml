I hear a chord, from there I hear a word
For you to listen
I will run and I will hide
Just because I can’t deny

I hear a word and then I hear a chord
For you to listen when you save me
I will not stand my grave today
Because I will see another day

And The Day Then Fades
And The Darkness Breaks
As I start to fade
I'm fading more
Then I walk out the door
And I hear some more
I hear a word, not just a chord
I hear the chords come through my door
And I betray the day
As my chords and words break

I hear a chord, from there I hear a word
For you to listen
I will run and I will hide
Just because I can’t deny

I hear a word and then I hear a chord
For you to listen when you save me
I will not stand my grave today
Because I will see another day

Oh Oh
Yeah
No No No
Yeah oh

I hear a chord, from there I hear a word
For you to listen
I will run and I will hide
Just because I can not die
