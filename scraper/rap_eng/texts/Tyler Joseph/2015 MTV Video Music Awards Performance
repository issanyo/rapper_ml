[Tyler Joseph - Heavydirtysoul, Verse 1]
There's an infestation in my mind’s imagination
I hope they choke on smoke cause I’m smoking them out the basement

[A$AP Rocky - Freestyle]
A real boss don't move for nobody
But my shooter, he got plenty bodies, he hit anybody

[Tyler Joseph - Heavydirtysoul, Verse 1]
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
Cause I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t rushing to saying nothing

[A$AP Rocky - (Freestyle?)]
Each and everybody, somebody
Any, any, eenie meenie minie moebody, stiff
Nobody live

[Tyler Joseph (A$AP Rocky) - Heavydirtysoul, Chorus (JD, Verse)]
(Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace)
Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?
For me, for me
Can you save my heavydirtysoul?

[A$AP Rocky - M'$, Verse 1]
(You ain't got no Flacko in your Serato?)
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!!!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Talk about M's

[Tyler Joseph (A$AP Rocky) - Message Man, Verse 3 (M'$, Hook)]
Hope you're dead cause how could you
Sleep at a time like this? (Talk about M's)
People they rhyme like this (M's)
We're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it
But these are just triplets (Make 'em talk about, make 'em talk about M's)
Wrote this in three minutes (Talk about M's)
Three words to a line
It's just poetry divided
I'm the kind of guy (Talk about M's)
Who takes every moment
He knows he confided in (Talk about M's)
Music to use it
For others to use it (Talk about M's)
You're dead cause how could you
Sleep at a time like this? (Talk about M's, M's)

[Tyler Joseph - Lane Boy, Verse 2]
I’m sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack
He’s my brother, he likes when I rap fast

[A$AP Rocky - (Freestyle?)]
[?]
Don't hold your breath, load your piece and then squeeze, then release

[Tyler Joseph - Lane Boy, Verse 2]
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You’re gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I’m hearing are so heartless
Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless

[Tyler Joseph (A$AP Rocky) - Lane Boy, Hook]
They say, "stay in your lane, boy, (lane, boy), lane, boy"
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, (highway), highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

[A$AP Rocky (Tyler Joseph) - L$D, Verse]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Get low)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I dream about her all day (All day)
I think about her with her clothes off (Stay low, stay low)
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say, "I love you" (Stay low, stay low)
But I ain't into makin' love songs (Are you ready? Are you ready?)
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD (Here we go, let's do this, 1, 2)
1, 2, 3, go!

[A$AP Rocky (Tyler Joseph) - L$D, Chorus (Lane Boy, Hook)]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up (They say, "stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy")
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds (But we go where we want to)
Held this feeling for way too long (They think this thing is a highway, highway)
Said, "I really wanna let it go" (But will they be alive tomorrow?)

[Tyler Joseph (A$AP Rocky) - Outro]
Remembering the day (Cause we both came to stay)
They call him "Pretty Flacko" (And they call him "BLURRYFΛCE")
We're calling up our mommas with no drama just to say
"Look momma, we made it, we're on the VMAs!" (Ayy)
