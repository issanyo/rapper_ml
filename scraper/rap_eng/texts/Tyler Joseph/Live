[Intro]
Hey dawg
Hey waddup?
Hey you see all them cars over there?
Man I'm counting about fifteen cars
Man there about thirty-eight dawg
Hey man lets go back there and find out what they going on
In [?] little house [?] party [?] over there know what I'm saying
Aww baby lets go on over there though [?]
I'm about to find out what's going on with this
What's going on over there?

[Verse 1: Jocef]
Take it all off
Pull a Kelly
Trey Songz was never me
From [?]
I express what I want
This is my art
My music
Inspired by Blueprint
Do not tell me I cannot like Rueben
They gave me a scarlet eight
All it does is match grey just because I'm from the buckeye state
This couldn't be any hotter if it was heated in the oven
God gave me five talents
I made something out of nothin'
Since Enoch died not too much feels authentic
In twenty four hours views could get shifted
Likemind
So I had to troubleshoot
God is my everything
I couldn't live without Him if I wanted to
Chance in our music
Skydive
See what I do
Haven't been this high
Since she said
I still love you
On the day
I barely touched the truth
Every hater hates cause they're not
Feeling you

[Hook: Jocef]
C'mon now, now y'all get live
Nod your heads from side to side
We won't shut up without the instruments
You want silence
You better unplug the whole set
C'mon now, now y'all get live
Wave your hands from side to side
We won't shut up without the instruments
You want silence
You better unplug the set

[Verse 2: Juda]
To you
Lets pretend that this is my weight station
My awakenin'
An opportunity to put down the playstation
The final shot at glory
Like a young rapid [?]
Before the buzzer was roarin'
I miss Pike
The thug life
Ain't nothing for me
Shooting balls off the bus
Felt like I was world tourin'
Concrete scorching from the heavens of the brain
Endangered in the hood with the grace of a whooping crane
I spend a thousand hours
Trying to modify a coward
With a little bit of pressure
Build a diamond out of powder
[?] solid
Only one year of college
And it's onto the league
With the Carmelo logic
Do my numbers
Turn every verse to summer
Guys work partner got a problem
Go confront 'em
Live from the slums
Fly wires and young
Super Juda move them with the best part none

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Alon]
Blast with it
Alon be quick with it
Hold a roof when these dudes
Proceed to rip with it
Jocef called and said to come get it
So I jetted with the gift
To shoot the track at it
Blessed student of artists and trendsetters
And those who took else
To ensure a future better
[?] to the king and say Mother Teresa
Aim for [?]
For not bookclubs and Oprah
Cinnamon coated lips
Spinal fluid rolling with
No heart or soul
You better wake up William Wallace kid
Cry [?] for all [?] something kid
Because when it's done
You either sorry
Or you're legend kid
I press for the latter
Adder snakes couldn't paralyze my mental
With venom to stop the predator
Alon, can, and will before I heard Obama
Christ will still listen
That's all I got for ya

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tyler Joseph]
Tell me something
Why are all these people loving
Rappers that are saying nothing
Completely ignoring that their soul is snoring
And thumping their own chest
Saying that "I am the best"
But please ignore that I'm insecure
Did I mention I'm the best?
Guess why you can't sleep at night?
I won't even rhyme this part this time
So listen
What do you believe?

Did it sink in?
Did it sink in hardcore?
Like Abe Lincoln fore score and 7 years ago
That's a pun, it was fun, there you go
I don't want to overload you
But I've already told you
No wait I haven't told you yet
But here we go so
You need to pick what you believe
We do not last forever
Even though Drake thinks we do
Please, I'm a self proclaimed critic
Shining light on what we fear
And I say it if I can fit it, thanks for letting light fit here

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yo nigga why is he hollering?
Is that a band?
Ayy turn that racket down
We trying to sleep
We're trying to get some sleep around here
This is the neigh-
This is the police
