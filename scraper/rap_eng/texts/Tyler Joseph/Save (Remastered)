[Verse 1]
I won't take much of Your time
I just want You to see
What I have made inside these lines
It's as good as I can be

It's as good as I can be
This is all that I can be
This is all that I can be
All that I can be, oh

[Chorus]
Head tilted down, knees on the ground
And I will ask, "Please... Save!
Save me! Please, save, save!
Save, save, save, save, save, save
Save, save, save me, save me, save me, save me!"

[Verse 2]
I deserve for You to turn away
I was ashamed to speak Your name
I can't believe that all You see is
That You have covered me gracefully

You're all I want to be
You're all I want to be
You're all I'll ever need
You're all I'll ever need

[Alt. Chorus]
Jesus...
Please save me!
Please, save, save!
Save, save, save, save, save, save
Save, save, save me, save me, save me, save me!

[Outro]
I won't take much of your time
Just enough for You to save me
