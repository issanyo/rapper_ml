[Verse 1: The Pantaloon]
Your Grandpa died
When you were nine
They say he
Had lost his mind
You have learned
Way too soon
You should never trust the Pantaloon

[Hook 1: The Pantaloon]
You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favourite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground walk
Lose your mind

[Verse 2: Semi-Automatic]
I'm never what I like
I'm double sided
And I just can't hide
I kind of like it
When I make you cry
Cause I'm twisted up
I'm twisted up
Inside my mind

[Verse 3: Forest]
Down in the forest
We'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher
We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote
Down in the forest
We'll sing a chorus
More than anybody knows
Hands held higher
We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

[Verse 4: Screen]
I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

Trying to be so cool
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 5: Ode To Sleep]
But I'll tell them why
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell them

[Verse 6: Addict With A Pen]
Hello
We haven't talked in quite some time
I know I haven't been the best
Of sons
Hello
I've been travelling the desert of my mind
And I haven't found a drop

I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need and
The waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I try my best and all that I can
To hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just being dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen, who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth, mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again, see you tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy suicidal head case
But you specialise in dying, you hear me screaming "father"
And I'm lying here just crying, so wash me with your water

[Verse 7: Screen]
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people
We're broken people, yeah
We're broken  (Ohhhh)
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people
We're broken people
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people
We're broken people, yeah
