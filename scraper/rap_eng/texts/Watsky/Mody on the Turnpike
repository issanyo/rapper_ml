Wow, what a ton of fun
I'm sitting on the 101
In traffic and scratching on my ass again
I guess it's out of habit
Cause cause it doesn't itch I fidget
And I'm switching my position
So my weight is on my left butt cheek

Pissed cause I know my shitty phone is gonna ring again
I want to fucking chuck it off an overpass
I never want to think about a million little problems and I'm gonna hit ignore
Because I don't agree that we must speak

Cause I gotta get away
I know gotta take a break
I'm booking a vacation
Doesn't matter watcha call it
I'm a total workaholic
And I haven't even made the time to have a any relationship in five damn years

Moving at the speed of light
Because I was afraid of living in the dark
I always gotta finish what I start
Although I'm sorry that I didn't do the dishes
I was busy but I'll get em in the morning if the time appears
