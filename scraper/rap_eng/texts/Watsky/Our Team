I drive a blue car, a shitty little used car
And I won’t be in a new car until every one of you are
I’m in this Subaru just cruising with my dude shotty
Me and Chukwudi wiping boogers on your Bugatti
We bukkake your Bugatti with snot rockets
Do not knock it
My crew’s hotter than Hot Pockets
Man we’re some damn survivors
And someday we’ll be riding on albino Bengal tigers
We’ll be goin Platinum with no plateaus
You’ll be fittin cities in the shadow of our chateaus
And we will buy all the tacos, pools got all the grottos
Our autos got grottos
Glass bottom Benzes fuck you we got those
Backstroke to the trunk to duck the paparazzo
Or fuck it maybe not though
Either way I’ll roll with my muchachos

Before we fly into a rage
Try to keep a parakeet who’s wiser than its age
We’ll use our wings to bend the wires of the cage
My inky fingers kindling the fire on my page
We’ll keep it true and that’s a pinky fucking swear
Drink your blood but do it with a pinky in the air
Pinky and the brain
Kinky Jewish hair
And when we fall we’ll do it like a slinky on the stair
Jinky Scooby Doo, this dude’s the shit
I handle business while a doobie dangles from my lips
Hit an iceberg but we won’t abandon ship
While the Titanic’s sinking we’ll be dancing on the tip
And if they drop an anvil on our anthill
And we amble at our ankles bent at angles
We won’t trip
The Earth'll split because we're off the fucking Richter
We can turn a victim to a victor

Kudi’s been crashing in the backroom and he might freeze
Each night he realizes DVDs and Nikes
If you shuffle past the empty whip-it canisters, down the hall and up the stairs
And past the busted banister
D's pushing Cali but he says the high is heady
He mailed himself a couple of Os he sewed inside a teddy bear
I’m steady there in Max’s bedroom working on a dope banger
Rapping through some panty hose we stretched over a clothes hanger
And I’m still scraping bird shit off the merch box
Staying up in Super 8s and writing rhymes in Word docs
Cause nothing worth having works fast
And I’ll be riding coach until the whole squads in first class
If you can’t see it find your contacts
Play this verse in court and use it as a binding contract
Put it on my mom pact I won’t bitch and moan
I’d rather I’d be broke with the homies than rich alone

You can smell the excellence when one of us appears
It must be musty with the musk of all my Musketeers
So crack a couple beers
We’ll burn this sucker free
We take no fuckery
So you can raise your cup of cheer
We’re fucking durable
We’re sparklier than Charles Barkley’s head; you’re fucking turrible
