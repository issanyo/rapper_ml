[Chorus]
Limo for emos, limo for emos, limo for emos
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Limo for emos, limo for emos)
(Let's go)

[Verse 1]
You've got knives in your broken heart
I'm outside in my go-kart
So cut your last pair
And put up your black hair in a bun
And come fast, we can run like mascara
You got force like Joan of Arc
And he falls short like Bonaparte
And you deserve greater, I know I'm no savior
But I'm here right now, so let's go
Kinda feels like we've been running every day of our lives
And shattering hearts and havin' ours cracked
But if you went and threw the broken hearts in a pile
And added the stack, then what do you have?
You in the black, deep in the red
If you're in your bed then you should come meet me instead
And out of the misery you know you've got a friend
Said you got me (You got me)
(Can't break you down)

[Chorus]
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Limo for emos, limo for emos)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Anytime, anywhere)
Cry and I'll be right there (Let's go)

[Verse 2]
They want us movin' at the speed of light but we won't hurry
Let's hit the city and stay out so late that it gets early
Like early on when we were livin' on the cheapest thrills
Because the town we fell in love with has the steepest hills
But those downs rebound to ups
Tried to push dad's coupe and torch the clutch
And they built us with extra gears and our cars run on ex's tears
Last night I realized I'm still sleepin' on my mattress edge
Saving room for someone who's not coming back to bed
But if we meet, I got room here in the shotgun seat
But if you'd rather take the keys, please, I'll put up my feet
We pay taxes, we live frugal
Wear new suits to old friends' funerals
Have true loves until they're false

[Bridge]
But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
Cry and I'll be right there

[Chorus]
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Cry and I'll be right there)
(Let's go)

[Outro]
(Let's go)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Cry and I'll be right there)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Cry and I'll be right there)
(Let's go)
Limo for emos
