[Verse 1]
I remember it was broad daylight
We were mobbing down Broadway right
Past all the North Beach titty bars
Condor Club, Little Darlings and my shitty car
You were looking darn fine in the passenger side of my Momma's old ride and
I was thinking if I don't say shit then I won't say shit
So this scrub shit ends right here
It's been a pain in the ass sitting on this awkward feeling
But I know that it's real and I'm thinking that you probably had an inkling judging how you leaned back inside and said

[Chorus]
"Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side."
"Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side."
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner

[Verse 2]
So I thought for a bit
Sounds like a hot pile of fuck that shit cause
What about sacrifice?
Doing what we got to cause it's too painful not to
You said "That's really a beautiful thought but let's not be naive and deceive ourselves.  You're gonna leave California and for your own sake please don't force a mistake"
Life tends to take irregular courses guided by devilish forces
Maybe you could be my wife stepping from our second divorces before we turn forever to corpses
I just think you're clever and gorgeous
If I ever get to enter that fortress
And pour this pleasure into every orifice
I won't be checking my watch
I won't be checking it

[Chorus]
"Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side."
"Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side."
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner
