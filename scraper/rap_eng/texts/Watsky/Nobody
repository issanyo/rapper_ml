[Intro: Stefanie Berecz]
Nobody, nobody

[Verse 1: Spose]
I was nobody (nobody), nobody believed
Pregnant women couldn't even conceive
Man your aunt used to hate on my steez
Then she heard it, fell in love, and now your aunt's sorry like Aziz
I'm at the jubilee, let me know if you believe
I've awoken, they thought I was joking, wouldn't humor me
Man they used to laugh at him, thought that I was ludicrous
I don't mean the rapper, just the adjective, man can you imagine it?
Cause now I'm shining luminous, just look at who I grew to be
Accomplishments are numerous, been reppin' my community
It's somethin' (It's somethin'), how you can start from nothin'
Then rock it from microscopic to the topic of discussion from the bottom
And then you touch the roof, that's like a tongue ring
Could change my name, still would get the W like tungsten
That's a science joke, I'm the broke
Tie a rope around the dying goat to pull it out the lion's throat
Man look at Ryan go, the way I carry a mic
I'm gonna end up with some flowers on my burial site
I'm still moving, ascending on my aerial flight
Breaking every radio, smashing stereotypes

[Pre-Hook: Spose]
But I was supposed to curl up, I was supposed to back down
I was supposed to fade, evaporate into the background
I was supposed to never be nothing but made it to something
I knew I could do it, I will make it through it I'll prove it
I was just another human who was supposed to be

[Hook: Stefanie Berecz & Spose]
Nobody, nobody
Been acting like nobody
But I don't wanna be
Nobody (Ayuh)

[Verse 2: Spose]
I wasn't born in a nativity, just in anonymity
So all the props they've given me, I've risen to divinity
He felt like Chris, and 'Jimmy!' made him feel good
Her whole perspective changed when she heard 'Knocking On Wood'
He got arrested in college, that shit was not planned
He was scurred, then he heard 'God Damn'
And played it, and played it, cause what I say, he related
I became his favorite, he made it out to my tour date, elated
Now he's up in the front going crazy
Word for word in my cadence
I told him "I was nobody, now I'm sold out on stages"
And that got me feeling six feet, but I couldn't fathom
That my words could be the light that lead the weary out the cavern
I'm still better than your verbals, I'm eating rappers like hors d'oerves
I'm Biggie but more Urkel (What you doing?)
I'm rocking mics until I'm sore, purple (And then what?)
And then I'm outtie like four circles
Dreamt of the brighter days, stuck to the battle plan
Weathered all the tidal waves, climbed through the avalanche
Hop up out the back of vans and then I make 'em clap their hands
Boy, I'm feeling like the man

[Pre-Hook: Spose]
But I was supposed to curl up, I was supposed to back down
I was supposed to fade, evaporate into the background
I was supposed to never be nothing but made it to something
I knew I could do it, I will make it through it I'll prove it, I was just another human who was supposed to be

[Hook: Stefanie Berecz & Spose]
Nobody, nobody
Been acting like nobody
But I don't wanna be
Nobody

[Verse 3: Watsky]
It takes smart choices and dumb luck
That's why there's billionaire dumbfucks
Geniuses driving dump trucks
Suckers with Lexuses, experts who won't make one buck
I've seen dreams die fast and wither slow
I've also seen 'em blooming where they're not supposed to grow
And I've seen the ones I've planted and watched 'em blossom in the snow
Ask me if I'm dank? (Are you dank?) Preposterously so
Another day, gotta get up and go
Keep on plotting even when my body be begging me no
Could be a regular Joe, but I gotta keep a promise
That I made to myself over a decade ago
Got a shot and almost spoiled it, no one's gonna foil it
I know I can toil, or flush this down the toilet
And that's why I try like Macy Gray
So I'ma keep trying till I'm grey
And emaciated, say what you wanna say you may see
I'm more than where you placed me
Whatever the case be, I'm singing in the rain
So you can bring the lobster, me and Spose will bring the pain
It's Watsky and the fucking King of Maine

[Pre-Hook: Spose]
But I was supposed to curl up, I was supposed to back down
I was supposed to fade, evaporate into the background
I was supposed to never be nothing but made it to something

[Hook: Stefanie Berecz & Spose]
Nobody, nobody
Been acting like nobody
But I don't wanna be
Nobody

[Post-hook: Spose & Stefanie Berecz]
They told me no, no
Yesterday they told me no, no
Ayup
Been acting like no, nobody, nobody
