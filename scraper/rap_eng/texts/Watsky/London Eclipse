Come, the moon is over the sun
We’ll use the shadows to run
No one can stop us from leaving
Come, the moon is over the sun
We’ll use the shadows to run
No one can stop us from leaving

Breathing’s boring
What a stupid task it’s
Only 8 a.m. this train’s a moving casket
Brew it black and spike your coffee with your flask
Before you leave the house each day pull on your 'fuck you' mask
You know that sad disguise
You know that patch of lies
Commuters pull their papers wide so folks can’t catch their eyes
We let these years of tears build up and now it’s heavy stakes
And we might drown this city if we let these levees break
So I gotta get a grip
Show ‘em I won’t let it slip
I know that what’s done is done and so that’s why it’s dumb to trip
I’m not scratching at the walls, that’s London at my fingertips
They use the news from yesterday to wrap tomorrow’s fish and chips
So you can print me on pretty, colorful paper
Right next to the psycho bitch who allegedly stabbed her neighbor
And I’ll be looking back up atcha until you’re ready to crumple me up
Oh, oh, oh

At the last eclipse, I was living as a single man
My girl’s looking through a pinhole camera
That she made out of a Pringle’s can
Pointed upwards at a gray London sky, pretending she could see the sun (the sun)
And I’m really looking right at her thinking maybe she could be the one
We could run
New York, L.A., UK, what do you say
Got no plans
Got no faith
Another new sun, gonna bring a new day
I wait to queue for the Baker loo, then I take the tube
30 minutes heading to Kent
And I’m coming straight to you with a big bouquet
We’re not anchored
We got our freedom and we can wander any path that we wanna on the planet
Damn it we don’t even need a answer
And I’m looking at all the 9 to 5ers on the train
But all the 9 to 5ers on the train are lookin at your pretty faces
Lookin at the sun that only you can see up in the Evening Standard
This could be home to me
Home could be anywhere
We could be anywhere
We could be free
I’m happy with you
If you were somewhere new
Do you think you still could be happy with me?
Timing is key and our timing was keen
And time is as slow and so why should we baby
You make me weak in the knees
We could move every weekend but only if we can agree to where
Home could be anywhere
We could be anywhere
We could be free
I’m happy with you
If you were somewhere new
Do you think you still could be happy with me?
Timing is key and our timing was keen
And time is as slow and so why should we baby
You make me weak in the knees
We could move every weekend but only if we can agree to where
