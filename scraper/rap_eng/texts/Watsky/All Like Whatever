[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever I got to do
Whatever I got to do

[Verse 1]
Yeah, maybe I think about you sometimes
Yeah, maybe I think you're pretty alright
Yeah, maybe it'd be decent if we linked up
Fuck, am I crazy just for dreaming of you all night?
I scroll through every picture that you took, so what?
I picture how our kids would look, so what?
I drew a picture of us in my notebook, so what?
So what I wrote a song about you, let's not go nuts

[Chorus]
I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever I got to do
Whatever I got to do

[Verse 2]
Whatever I gotta do to heal the pain
Whatever I gotta do so you feel the same
I guess I'd prolly' do like all the above
If you love me and each night you'd call me
And we'd talk on the phone and be all like whatever
'Cause yeah, dreamin' of you's an all-night endeavor
And yeah, it'd be chill to spend our lives together
Whatever, whatever, never mind if it's an effort

[Chorus]
I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever I got to do
Whatever I got to do

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
Whatever
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
Whatever
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
Whatever
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever I got to do
Whatever I got to do
I look at you and I'm all like whatever
I think of you and I'm all like whatever
I dream of you and I'm all like whatever, whatever, whatever
