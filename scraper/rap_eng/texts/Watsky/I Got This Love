[Chorus: Passion]
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

[Verse 1: Watsky]
Because of Jonestown
Because of Auschwitz
Because the leaves fall and we can't stop it
But that makes fall leaves
I'mma start a mosh pit
(ch!) This is your captain
Hopping out the cockpit
I forgot my parachute
But I got my bay sounds
So I'll be going dummy
Rocking on the way down
I'll be saying "hey ground!"
Howzabout we make out?
I'll put on some Ray Brown
You can grab some take out
Love isn't more sin, love isn't forced in
Getting under your skin, digging for endorphins
It's the portion some of us'll forgo
Fingers on your torso tapping you in Morse code
The opera aria we're singing like a bar song
The stranger's pretty face that hits you like a car bomb
The wrinkled note we passed in class in second grade
And all it says up on the page (is)

[Chorus: Passion]
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

[Verse 2: Watsky]
Because my Grandma lived to 99-eleven months
Between a hundred years of solitude and heaven once
Because she loved her son but couldn't ever say it right
Because the language of the planet isn't day and night
It's in the in between, it's when we intervene
And never let a silly hater rabbit pimp the scene
For the deaf kid in the aisle of the symphony
Who hears it through the rumble of the tuba and the timpani
For those lay waste to beauty with a straight face
Everywhere on earth we're all escaping from the same place
And, yes, occasionally we get drunk and out of line
Last night, there's a lamp post that I asked to be my valentine
Take a shady place, shine until it radiates
Seventeen to eighty eight, make a break and head west
Or make a promise to your lady in a red dress
Last night in my hot mess
That lamp post said yes

[Chorus: Passion]
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

[Verse 3: Watsky]
Detroit is equal till there's half its people laid off
While corporate lawyers and former employers play golf
Because of furor over every juror paid off
And because the FÃ¼hrer used to be a boy named Adolf
Because of Anakin, instead of panickin'
And because of every man who can be more than just a manaquin
Because of Tienanmen, because there was a cameraman
And because of the cameraman chasing princess Diana and
Because of Tammany hall, because of Gramercy park
Because of Amityville and because of amnesty
Because of famine and because its not a fantasy
Because of every tenement into family
Tentative to say cause of combs cause of hannity
Homes for humanity the bones of my ancestry
Grown and gone on gravestones and drawn on payphones and palms
Raised up in alms
