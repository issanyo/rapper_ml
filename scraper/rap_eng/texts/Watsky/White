Just another white kid who likes to wear flip flops, packs snacks in zip
Locks, and fucking loves hip hop
Lets get historical this is how the story goes
Bout a white boy with soul waiting to overflow
Sean J & I were rapping , even though ya know
That they were black as night and I was white as morning glow
And our backgrounds were from different postal codes
Im so white they invited me to the Maury Show
And I stood in the middle of the stage, sandwiched by the group, looking
Like an oreo
They ask how this whack cracker be rhyming
When he blends in to the white wall behindem
I say I love words, I say I love music, so why the hell can't I combine em?
But you could hint that I was insecure
Cuz my skin color made me a prisoner
Embarassed for my priviledge, my parents and my heritage
Hid it beneath black clothes, arrogantly tinted it
Surpressed the white in me, put it in a hidden file
Not the first jew swimmin down the river of denial
On the Sat’s I had to check the box and brand it
And my moms from peru so I said I’m Hispanic damn it
They asked if I rap and it made me claustrophobic
So I said no, I’m a rhythmic poet
But then I’m freesstyling and the crowd is whiling
And im in my flow state so time is flying
And that’s when the pigment of my skin is but a dam mirage
And everybody in the room began to camouflage
That’s when I realized that race isn’t definite
The prejudices irrelevant, I’m accepting my Melanin
I’m coming out of the darkness and into the light
Im white and I rap and I rap and im white

White kid learns, white kid listens
White kid feels, white kid's spittin
White kid hears, white kid doubts
White kid just wants to let you know what he's about

I'm white, I'm whiter than a San francisco mist
I'm white, I'm whiter than the inside of a fist
I'm white, I'm often mistaken for casper
And I'm often compared to Eminem and asher
I’m white, I’ll greet you with a wave and a howdy
I’m white, you need sunglasses around me
I’m white, I’m the third leading cause of blindness
And I turn to a tomatoe in sweltering climates
I’m so whass iite I’m a cereal killer
To get the prize at the bottom, bring your cheerios nearer
So white I got caught for litterin’
Am I known to start beef? Ya while twitterin’
Maybe I don’t understand Wolf Gang or Wu Tang
But the spirit of the lyrics made my mood change
And my skin ain't too white to feel the frequency
Cuz I speak to hip hop, as she speaks to me

[Hook]

I'm aware that I'm very white
But I'm very scared of sterry-types
Because I'm white like Charlie Brown
But oddly unlike Barry White
More like Mary Kate & Ashley, I'm arian
In your forrest being white like the merry men
Strumming on a theramin, nerdy but I'm very mean
God pumped me from a machine at a Dairy Queen
Marachino cherry on top, Sara Lee
Not the type of weenie you'd excpect to spit this kerosene
And I was born to white parents so someday I'll die a weird white death, David Caradine
Couldn't hang if you had a carabeener
Sometimes I wish I was a beaner, but the grass is always greener
When your ass is white, but I'm not a white ladies man
But I'm so white, that I'm practically Canadian
