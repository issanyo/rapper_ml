[Chorus]
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm feelin' pretty damn good right now
Yeah, I feel good (good)
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm feelin' pretty damn good right now
I feel good (good)
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm fresh as fuck (I'm dope)
I'm fresh as fuck (I'm dope)
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm feelin' pretty damn good right now
I feel good (good)
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm feelin' pretty damn dope

[Verse 1: Acumental]
Yo, I get paid to act like a maniac
Obliterate the wack and evade disasters
Rhyme to the bass and clap, Term K and Ac branching out like chain reactors (uh)
It's the main attraction, ride to the vibe of your favorite rappers
Buy on a vinyl and play it backwards, divine like I'm climbin' up Jacob's Ladder (goddamn)
Yeah, we take our time and go nationwide like the great divide
Hide in plain sight like Malaysian flight,
Style invisible to the naked eye
Everyday and night of a casual killer, snappin' a pic with a flash and a flicker
I'm too advanced for beginners, Ac got the cat in the bag and the bag in the river
Ooh, Kobayashi Maru, so there ain't no other option for you
I can do the impossible too, hop in the booth and I hope you like hospital food!
Cause I gotta get my credit right now, wanna get high, never come down with disease
Flow like a rip tide, turn the beat loud and we get live y'all better bow to the kings
I'm an ungrateful degenerate, never been labeled a gentlemen
We cleverly state the irrelevant, said to be steadily shaping our rhetoric
T.K. Acumental, and Watsky, killin' infinitesimal copies
Off the grid, call me Jesse the Body, I'm blessing the beat catchin' rec with my posse

[Chorus]
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm feelin' pretty damn good right now
Yeah, I feel good (good)
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm fresh as fuck (I'm dope)
I'm fresh as fuck (I'm dope)
Yo, I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm feelin' pretty damn good right now
Yeah, I feel good (good)
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm dope, I'm feelin' pretty damn dope, I'm dope

[Verse 2: Terminal Knowledge]
I ain't laid a trap in the flash with a flash and a bang, yeah I'm finna bring the pain you after
Man with the method like famous actors, the bones that I made may break your fracture
Uh, get taken captive, high as a kite see shapes and patterns
Tired? You might wanna take a nap first
The rifle fires, my brains are scattered (goddamn)
Ain't that the truth
Hand to hand, be the proof in the pudding
Y'all fantasy land, as a matter of fact no lie when I'm in the booth
So fly, no pigeon coop. Don't give a hoot, go manic depressive
No letterman jackets in fact the scholastic endeavors just didn't compute
Woo! I'm in love with the beat, they like so why don't you marry it?
Cause the thought of me tying a knot that'll stay tied? Kinda hilarious
Tossed to the wayside, not finna take time off, gonna make my march
Stay blind to the bullshit
I'ma live life to the fullest, with a bomb, highly explosive
I'm a recluse and a maverick, I'm a solution to labyrinth
Man is a evolution, you can set the standard (resolution)
Beach squad and George to the Watsky
Jihad, I'm sort of a Nazi
Not actually, only grammatically
Beat rockin' is more than a hobby, I'm dope!

[Chorus]
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm feelin' pretty damn good right now
Yeah, I feel good (good)
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm fresh as fuck (I'm dope)
I'm fresh as fuck (I'm dope)
Yo, I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm feelin' pretty damn good right now
Yeah, I feel good (good)
I fuckin' rule, I fuckin' rock, I'm fuckin' cool
I'm fresh as fuck (I'm dope)
I'm dope (I'm dope)

[Verse 3: Watsky]
The man from San Fran to bring the death, chaos
Hail from the bay by the San Andreas
Never let a bland band play us
Stay raised on a higher level like a Deus
Go Van Damme, is it Jean-Claude
When I'm kicking in the chest of a non-god
Batting any body like I'm Rowdy Roddie Piper
When I'm on the beat you better call the bomb squad
You played DnD? I'm a Deity
Being me is a fun ass gig, G
No big if a couple folks don't dig me
I just walked out the Ivy at Wrigley
And met up with the Palmer Squares
Still pullin' leafs from my arm and hair (Goddamn)
I'm an abomination certain to make a conservative scared like ObamaCare
Our posse is verbally slamming your prominent shamans with dominant stamina
Rapping without even taking a breath
While we're jogging nonstop down from Boston to Panama
Banding together for this family endeavor
We’re the clan of the clever
Word on the street is my past pretty checkered
But a word is to me, like a lamb to a Shepard
So don’t put a limit on what you think I could be doing
Never put a man on a tether
Parameters are for amateurs
My tongue is a samurai sword
If I’m bored I’mma sever
Whatever, you put it in my path
I'mma cut it in half and put my foot in your ass
Until you're beyond repair
It's Watsky and the Palmer Squares
