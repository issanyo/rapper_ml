[Chorus 1: Leah Goldman]
Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

[Verse 1: Watsky]
I wanna love with flames that lick the dark
Give me the dying explosion of a sinking star
No constellation of dull and blinking sparks
I think of what my love would want and try to fit the part, but I rarely hit the mark
These days I sleep in fits and starts guarding trying to weed this garden of these scars
Digging through a pile of discarded hearts
They’re shaped like boomerangs who we tossed into the wind and hoped they circle back
My heart is more arrow, travelling the straight retreating track
But if it goes tumbling over the horizon and clear around the planet it’ll still return in time
And I’ll be in California waiting
I will hold the line

[Chorus 2: Leah Goldman]
So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things I own I will share with you
If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

[Verse 2: Watsky]
These rushing highs and crushing lows
Blushing glows on crushes
Roses then blunted blows
We clutch each other like we’re crutches
Trade punches then wipe each other’s bloody noses as we stumble roads and stub our toes
To what we go nobody knows
We’re lying on the butcher block together hoping
Holding hands and watching the gleaming cleaver draw nearer in slow motion
Throwing pebbles over the side of the well and waiting forever for the echo
Lying in bed and wondering how far the blackness stretches outside our window
Together is not a strong enough word for the opposite of alone
The relief of finally feeling understood
Each other’s arms are home

[Chorus 3: Leah Goldman]
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
