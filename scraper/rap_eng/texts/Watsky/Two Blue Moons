[Verse 1]
A couple red sons popping out a new womb
Twins come twice, once in a blue moon
Feeling like a joke in the nude, rude humor
We were born premature, and they said "Too soon"
Sing a new tune, act less fickle
Most twins cling like a pair of testicles
We haven't been tight since we breastfed little
Said me on the right and you on the left nipple
Said it's that simple, have to discover
If you act a bit smothered while you're trapped with big brother
9 long months kicking it inside our mother
Never kicked her belly, hell, we only kicked each other
If we suffer we can get well when we grow
Get born, ready? Go! Got a separate embryo
Breaking like a levee though, wading through the heavy flow
When you see the light, let me know (bro)

[Hook]
The moon is out tonight (It's bright)
Is everything alright? (Not quite)
I wouldn't act like I know (no) know (no) know (no) know (no) know
Just what you're going through (No shit)
But if you're feeling blue (Don't quit)
I want to tell you, my brother, I feel the same way too

[Verse 2]
There were weeks you can bet I couldn't eat
Looking at my cooking with a set of wooden teeth
Opened up my big mouth, found that I could speak
So I put another foot in it, but now I couldn't leave
It's good to see all the losers taking days
To think of dumping shit on you in new, creative ways
You can say that it's a phase
Or some rude complaining crap
It's a stupid way to act, man, but two can play at that
I've been a brat, made more than one slip
My lips got unzipped, I quipped some dumb shit
Our folks were so sick, it made them cringe
I followed my jaw's lead, and came unhinged
I'm sorry man, but can the shit end here?
Cause we haven't really talked in about ten years
And that's ten too many cause if you were anyone else
I wouldn't see you in myself

[Hook]

Aching in the chest, try to take it from the stress
Shrink made me quit, I was making him depressed
Usually I'm upbeat, tearing through the halls
But instead of bouncing off 'em I was staring at the walls
Care to make the call which separates faster
A fence of placenta, an inch made of plaster
A handful of strands of our DNA
Either we both were alone or it seemed that way
Kept to myself, I'd reflect by myself
Dude, I left and I fucking saw Shrek by myself (Oh no!)
It's no help to assume we're less than
To mom it's yes ma'am, I'm groom, you're best man
It's on the next fam to plan and proceed
But if we smoke weed, don't think we OD'd
No I don't know all the shit you've been through
But I've seen a window, and I know I've been too

[Hook]
