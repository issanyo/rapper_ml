Excuse me, miss, what's your name?
That's a nice name
I had to write this haiku:
"Hi! I like like you
For your high IQ, and you're
Quite fine too. Date me?"
You showed the poem to your friends? (messed up)
Whatever, I don't need it
I can read between the lines, be conceited
I'll beat it, cause I don't really have the T-I-M-E, time

You're coming on a little strong, okay?
I get it
When I was there you barely wanted me
Now I'm scarce commodity
And since I'm rare you care to make my bare bod your property
I'm sorry princess, I boycott your boy ploy, I think it's best
I guess, we have thin common interests

I mean, it's not like your favorite South Park character is
Butters
Or your favorite food is
Mainly Japanese
And Amy's mac and cheese-
You too?
I get pretty torn up when I see roadkill
But damn, I just love manatees, they're so chill, right?

The Beatles are best
I could listen to Lennon again and again and
Especially Penny Lane
And Eminem is a beast with a pen and a pad
And drunk Denny's is better than Bennigan's any day
Odwalla, Koalas, Pico de Gallo, Tika Masala, Hakunah Matata
I'm looking at making a living in doing the one that I love with what I've been given
And I'm thinking that we could maybe bring the power nap back
I eat sugar from the bottom of the Sour Patch pack
Oh, snap!
It's like we're finishing each other's...
I love you, girl, you're my other half
Baby got me high like a hovercraft
Your loving got me high like I'm huffing or I puff and pass
Damn, you're so upperclass!
I want to get up it like a hand up a puppet's ass
Who'd you call a mother-?
You too
Up your-!
Untrue
I mean it, stop it, yo!

Well, if I'm a poor man's Michael Cera
You're Janeane Garofalo
No, your pouncing caused this downswing!
Maybe we should browse around for couple's counseling?
You make me sick, you give me fever
Then leave, I never liked you either!
