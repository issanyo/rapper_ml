[Verse 1]
It's '86 when my mama has me
30 seconds later when the doctor slaps me
15 years til I get my permit
And then 4 more til we're in the backseat
Of a taxi, crazy youngfolk
And then sun came up but none woke
It's 4:20 when I made that dumb joke
I was saying something like blah blah blunt smoke
And then it's later in the afternoon
In my backyard when we write this tune
2 days later when I pen the verses
Probably 8 months til you first heard it
So punch the clock, adjust your tie
Spike the punch and touch the sky
Life is hard and then you die
So let's all go hard tonight

[Chorus]
Remembering the days that felt so long
I bet you miss me
We spent the whole day dreaming, our minds made up
We're making history
Right now is right now
Too loud to die down
Right now is right now
No other time now

[Verse 2]
If time is money a second's a penny a minute's buck a couple years are a milly I'm getting really really filthy
Bitch, get me a bathtub!
I'm filthy rich, watching my pennies stack up
I shower in a typhoon
If time is dimes then I'm a tycoon
I'll glue em together and the climb to the moon
Climb to the moon! Climb to the moon!
We on Today, Today, Matt Laur
Every 24 we going like Jack Bauer
Hear the bell ringing I'm thinking it's that hour
Turning on my light and I set it to max power
Let's keep it going and going, I'm talking moment to moment we live the high and the low
And then when we're broken like cracking open a coconut we pull ourselves together again and we gotta go

[Chorus]

[Bridge (x4)]
Pushing offa the ground tonight
I be up in the clouds tonight
Looking over my town tonight
In the shadow we found the light
