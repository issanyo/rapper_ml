[Verse 1]
His footprints are fading away from the beach
We're not a family to pray or to preach
But daddy's best friend took a handful of pills and now he's at a podium making a speech
Yesterday night after dark
He carefully wrote his remarks
But everyone said what he put on his page so he threw it way and went straight from the heart

[Hook]
I thought this was a party
But all my friends are leaving
And I still want to play
You wrecked me when you stepped out
Cause you're the wounded healer
And you're supposed to stay

[Verse 2]
A year's a bottle in a bucket of trash
It'll tip over the more that it stacks
Didn't notice it till now but dad's been moving slower every time we go play catch
I'm scared of the day when he'll carry a cane
I carry his dream
I carry his name
And when papa is gone he will never be gone because the sound of our sneeze is the same

God bless I
Hear your voice
In mine
I want to stop time
Like a carnival ride
Because
I don't know what I'm saying but I mean it (repeat)

[Hook]
I thought this was a party
But all my friends are leaving
And I still want to play
You wrecked me when you stepped out
Cause you're the wounded healer
And you're supposed to stay

I thought this was a party
But all my friends are leaving
And I still want to play
You wrecked me when you stepped out
Cause you're the wounded healer
And you're supposed to stay
