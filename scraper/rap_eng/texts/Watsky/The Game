[Intro: Watsky]
I'm feelin' pretty good right now
(feelin' pretty fuckin' great right now)
Forever M.C., Watsky
Let's fuck this beat up, okay

[Verse 1: Watsky]
I'm Steven Seagal, [?] there ain't no better dude
I will harass a bastard with the awful attitude
I'll grab your head and shoulders, if you're super rude, and twist the two in opposite directions like a Rubik's cube
I start hearts like an EMT, unless you make me wanna' barf like you're TMZ
Then i'll leave you dead on a bed of lettuce like BLTs
And I creep away, TLC, I play keep away
With my DNA, when these needy beesies grab [?]
I keep the beat like Jack DeJohnette, cease the day, it's a piece of cake when I freak this bitch
[?] what you need to say, and then leave today s'il vous pla√Æt
And yeah, I'm pretty far for [?], but i still bring the heat like a jar of Kimchi
Ay, you want beef? Don't you ever tempt me, good grief, it's Watsky and Forever M.C

[Verse 2: Hi-Rez]
I'm the product of my bastard father
You can't offend me, i'm the last to bother
I'll snatch your daughter then i'll gas the throttle
I'll prolly pass up on the blunt, but I won't pass the bottle
You won't find me around the snakes like the cast of Anaconda
I want it badder than my next breath
A lot of weight on my chest, just like I bench press
Hustle to keep the lights on, been working for that rent check
I am not worried about these rappers famous for 10 secs
Rap game Marty McFly
You gon' hear me around the corner in the car that I drive
The rap game'll leave the chewed up, and buried alive
Like March 9th '97, I been ready to die
I'm a walking contradiction, I make my decisions, your whole life is fiction, rapping my religion
It's Forever, Watsky and Rez, we living on the edge, everyday plot on the bread
It's Rez
