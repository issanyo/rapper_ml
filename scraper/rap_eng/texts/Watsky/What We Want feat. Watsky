[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do

[Verse 1 - Bryarly]
You act like this is how it is
Draggin' at us like unfiltered cigarettes - it's common sense
But things have changed before
We've broken ceilings, now we're breakin' down the door
We're after more

I've had enough of waitin' for a man to say I'm decent
Pay attention, put your head up, and stop playin' with your *****
We want a share in power, it could go to better use
Than oppression, misconception, segregation and abuse

[Chorus]
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
What you can do
What you can do
What you can do
What you can do

[Verse 2 - Bryarly]
Well, you can have your day in court
But we're the jury, and your trial'll be short
See, this is war
Yell about it all you like
This irritation has been flowin' down the pike
And now we strike

I'm ready for a world where I can walk alone at night
And when I go to watch a show, not every character is white
Centuries go by, and still we're lacin' up our gloves
Lashin' back inside a fight I swear to God you haven't won

[Chorus]
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
What you can do
What you can do
What you can do
What you can do

[Bridge]
Yes, the going may be slow
But the more we move, the less left yet to go

[Verse 3 - Watsky]
Screamin' in the mic but all I hear is feedback
Batter batter better hit me in the kneecap
Give me payback, tie me to the train track
Every soul's another needle in the haystack

We want the right of way
We want it right away
We want a brighter day
But then we light a stick of dynamite and drink a jug of cyanide
But I'm aware there's gonna be a price to pay

[Chorus/Outro]
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
What you can do (ah)
What you can do (ah)
What you can do (ah)
What you can do (ah)

I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
(Do what you can do rep.)
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
(Do what you can do rep.)

What you can do  (do what I can do and do)
What you can do  (do what I can do and do)
What you can do  (do what I can do and do)
What you can do  (do what I can do and do)

I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
I'm gonna do what I can do and do, do what I can do and do
I'm gonna do what I can do and do and do
I'm gonna do what I can do and do and do
I'm gonna do what I can do and do and do
I'm gonna do what I can do and do and do
