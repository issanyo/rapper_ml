[Verse 1]
Looking out my window
Talking to my cat like he's kinfolk
I sip a coke and I drink slow
I'm in limbo
No plan B
No girlfriend, I just need to meet a nympho
But I won't cause I'm more sensitive than my lymph nodes
And I give too much info
You can't unzip
After saying dumb shit like
Like I hear your name every time the wind blows
I gave a chilly chick my jacket and my skin froze
And then she jacked it and just ran off with my thin clothes
I guess that shit makes her a heartbreaker in my windbreaker
I'm not tripping off the bimbos, I just think about the puns that I can spit later
She couldn't salt me, she was just a hip shaker
And to answer the question that you implied in your eyes
No, I don't think that I'm smarter than a fifth grader

[Hook]

Ladies, Ladies, Ladies
Women, women women
Honies, honies, honies
Girlies, girlies, girlies

Ladies, ladies, ladies
Bunnies, bunnies, bunnies
Women, women, women
They're my honies, honies

[Verse 2]
Reality valedictorian
Graduated to the next level and I hopped in my Delorean
Aurora borealis in my rearview, man it's glorious
Waking up at noon, I'm notorious
I'm gonna roll the dice, I'm very lucky, but fuck it
Papa needs a new pair of huggies
In this life of hard knocks
Feeling like the Hulk, I throw my enemies against the wall across the room like they were my alarm clock
After dark, car parked right on our block
Arm wrapped around the card stock chick propped up in the passenger seat for a sweet one-way heart to heart talk
I think I'm ahead of my age like I'm Dippin Dots
These women that I've dated lately really seem to think I'm odd-- Strange
They just nod
Which is hard without a head on their shoulders like Ichabod
Crane
