[Hook]
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again

[Bridge]
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years

[Verse 1]
Because if we don’t build it, who will?
I do things on a shoestring that you couldn’t do for a cool mil
I run with no laces, and when I fall, I start
To build my Taj Mahal with shit I found at Dollar Mart
This life’s our greatest project
The journey’s all an art
But I built my perfect nest and it’s ‘bout to fall apart
Again and again and then I just I make it twice as high
And I give my tower teeth, and I watch it bite the sky
Because I might just cry if I don’t keep it moving
I focus on what I can make and not what just got ruined
‘Cause every stone will crumble down to dust, to dust, to dust
And I say love thy neighbor, and I say fuck thy hater
There’s nothing I can’t solve with duct tape and construction paper
I don’t want a Band-Aid, I’ll only rip it off, I’ll rip it off

[Hook]
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again

[Verse 2]
I know someday I’ll pass, and maybe then rest
I’m laying on my back;
Heaven’s my bench press
‘Cause my imagination is crazy as Glenn Beck
A cloud is floating by in the shape of a rent check
And when the world ends, that’s what I’ll plan towards
Then I’ll trust girlfriends and maybe landlords
Cause I been played but I’m looking for more
I say, "What would I gain if I took it to court?"
‘Cause if people were perfect then there wouldn’t be war
We stay pushing but once we get a foot in the door
We get our toes chopped off and a foot of manure
I still gotta believe people
Are good at the core
‘Cause if we weren’t, what’s at stake?
Why would we stay to break what we make
And create all these beautiful mistakes
When they blow our house down let’s draw on the walls, the walls, the walls

[Bridge]
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years

[Hook]
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again
Out on the curb again
On the curb again
I’ve come to learn it’s hard and firm
Out on the curb again

[Bridge]
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years
I’m in my room making cardboard castles
With shoestring rope
Soup spoon drawbridge
Tinfoil moat
I’m still dreaming after all these years
