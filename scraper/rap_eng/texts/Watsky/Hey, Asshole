[Hook: Kate Nash]
Hey, asshole
See the sun is shining
But you are not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
I'm an asshole
Cause the sun is shining
But I am not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why

[Chorus: Watsky]
I know I'm often told
That there's a pot of gold
But I don't see no fucking rainbow and my coffee's cold
I know I should be grateful
I know I'm good and able
But I don't have the strength to get up from the kitchen table
This kind of shot comes once
Another opportunity of a lifetime just slipped away
And that's the fifth this month
But when you take a punch
Don't you ever forget
Why you get up and you put one foot in front of the next

[Verse 1: Watsky]
Got the power of my will
I don't wanna to win a mil
But I'm looking at window sill
Gotta take a bitter pill
Gonna pay for what I did to my head and my heart'll foot the bill
Got a foot in my mouth and because I'm kicking myself I developed a habit of knocking out my front tooth
Looking uncouth
Want to hear the truth
Give it to me straight
151 proof
Telling myself it'll happen when I'm happy but I'm climbing up a ladder that has got no end
Hung up on a rung I'll never make it to the top, I'm looking at the bottom and I must descend
All I want to do is buck this trend
Everybody need a buck to spend
And I'll be working on myself, til I work on someone else, til I get there Ima just pretend


[Chorus: Watsky  & Katy Nash]
I know I'm often told
That there's a pot of gold
But I don't see no fucking rainbow and my coffee's cold
I know I should be grateful
I know I'm good and able
But I don't have the strength to get up from the kitchen table
This kind of shot comes once
Another opportunity of a lifetime just slipped away
And that's the fifth this month
But when you take a punch
Don't you ever forget
Why you get up and you put one foot in front of the next

[Hook: Kate Nash]
Hey, asshole
See the sun is shining
But you are not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
I'm an asshole
Cause the sun is shining
But I am not smiling
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why


[Verse 2: Watsky]
When I'm in a crisis
In a moment of silence
I look under my eyelids
And I'm checking my mileage
I been using a pool of water as a mirror but not for style it's
So I can reach in and pimpslap my reflection for acting childish
Spent a half an hour
Sitting at the bottom of my shower
Letting the water run over my body and (dammit I wanted to get up) but I didn't have the power
I don't have the answer anyway yay (yay yay yay yay yay yay)
Don't want to panic but I got to come clean
Because the plan of the planet is just mean
Knew if was tough, but dammit it's obscene
I been huffing and puffing up to the top of the summit and I'mma rough it if I have enough steam
I'll keep on coming and coming until I'm coming with the stamina of a salmon who's heading upstream

[Bridge: Katy Nash]
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah

[Hook: Kate Nash]
Hey, asshole (hey asshole)
See the sun is shining (see the sun is shining)
But you are not smiling (but you are not smiling)
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
I'm an asshole (such an asshole)
Cause the sun is shining (cause the sun is shining)
But I am not smiling (no I am not smiling)
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
