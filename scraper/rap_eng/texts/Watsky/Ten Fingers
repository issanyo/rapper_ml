Never have I ever seen Passion of Christ
Never have I ever crashed on a bike
Or been trapped on an island and had to survive
And yeah I've been trashed a Saturday night
But never have I ever smoked crack from a pipe
I've never started one slow clap in my life
I never ever sat first class on a flight
Or drank cognac from a bird bath Never tried
To fly

And yeah, I'm known to cop a dub sack
But I've never have I ever rolled my own blunt wrap
Never have I banged to Purple Rain or Doveshack
Never have I ever loved and been loved back
Fun fact, Cause I've had a broken heart
But I've never ever ever put a woman over art
And I'm never gonna start
Never cheated on a chick
But Ask me if I've lied, then I'll likely plead the fifth

Never have I seen a ghost or a spirit
But if one appears then I'll know when I'm near it
And if I ever fucked a prophet I'd be quick to repent
But I've never known Jesus in the Biblical sense
But I've I think we'd be friends
If he went to my school and was cool and we kicked it in chem
I've never kissed a dude
Well that's partly true
Are we counting Spin the Bottle at a cast party too?
Oh my god, sooo gay
Pause
Tick tick tick tick
Press Play
I've never raved
I never been tased
Never maced or been maced
Or been punched in the face

Never have I ever contemplated suicide
Or been crucified
Never have I ever mooned another driver from the side of my hooptie ride
Never have I ever swallowed all my foolish pride
And I can't really tell
If I'm a good person or I'm faking really well
Cause every now and then I'd catch her on the phone
But I never really went to visit grandma at the home

And I've always known
That I won't be happy
Until I'm the best version of myself when I'm alone
So fuck thinking of marriage
Till I learn to put another person first and be a parent
I pinky swear it
