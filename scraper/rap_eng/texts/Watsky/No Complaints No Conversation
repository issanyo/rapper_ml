[Verse 1]
There's something wrong with her
There's something wrong with me
I don't think that's so wrong, we came by it honestly
And honestly, I think mostly everybody does
I don't blame you if you need to catch a buzz
I've built so much armor, but ring the alarm
I'm in love with someone who's bringing me harm
I'll pick lovers who got monsters and we bond on mental health
'Til they remind me of what's ugly in myself

[Chorus]
But other than that
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints

[Verse 2]
I'm always on the brink
About to fly or sink
A minion with opinions told me that I shouldn't think so hard
That shit just made me think so hard I couldn't sleep a wink
Washed my red flags with my white flags and now all my laundry's pink
I'm petty at best, someone to pity at worst
Putty in beautiful hands, potty mouth ready to curse
Cursed to be curious if all this is a scam
And I had to Google narcissist to check if that's what I am

[Chorus]
But other than that
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints

[Verse 3]
Either you get nothing
But they make you pay and pay
Or you get it till they take it all away
Every day, every day
It amazes me a hundred brand new faces
But I'm still trying to figure out who they is, shi-
I don't wanna settle one bit
Bet that I'm gonna battle for somebody, but if
I look at what we got and catch rot
Then I'm gonna come in with a hatchet and I cut it down quick
Cut around rust, cut around mold
Everybody ends up cold
Heads gotta roll, that's life
And you gotta be the neck or the knife
But I'm told that I can't quite quit this
Constant itch to matter, my restless drive to win
That's driving me, that drove away the closest of my kin
How I twist away when deep relationships begin
And shit, there's still the b'iness of the thinness of my skin
I'm vain, I'm lame, I'm strange and yet so typical
I make the same mistakes, I don't change shit, and still
My folks age and age, I hate to face facts
And I feel I wear their faces as a mask

[Chorus]
But other than that (I wear their faces as a mask)
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
(I wear their faces as a mask)
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
(As a mask)
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints
