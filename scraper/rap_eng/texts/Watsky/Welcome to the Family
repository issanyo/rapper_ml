[Verse 1]
Hello, hello, hello, hello (Hello, hello, hello, hello)
It's a motherfucking pleasure (It's a motherfucking pleasure)
No pressure, but would you like to blow my mind
And move too fast and plan our perfect lives together? (Plan our perfect lives together)
Holy, holy, holy, holy (Holy shit), you mean to tell me, tell me, tell-
You're tough to love when you don't love yourself? Well

[Chorus]
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

[Verse 2]
My less exciting features are packed inside my body
They're crammed into the balcony, they're jamming up the lobby
They're falling out the window
You can see them crashing through the glass
When I don't keep my lids closed as the director flicks his wrist
The stagehand in the wing has got a silver chain he grips
And when he lifts it opens up the velvet curtains of my lips
And I say

[Chorus]
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

[Verse 3]
We're not looking to wish on a star (Star)
We're no good at receiving the help (Help)
Who the hell do you think that you are? (Are?)
Trying to make me believe in myself
You're like the sun in the summertime
I know you are, but what am I?
I don't really wanna sound like a lullaby
But I think every family is a butterfly
You know, pretty from afar, pretty gross up close
Don't pity what we are, it's mostly unhideous
And I'm sitting at the bar with a beer
So cheers, come toast me
Get cozy since we're both lonely
Why don't we leap and then go see
What we become when it's done, it's dumb
But I'm not looking below, so don't ghost me
And it's seeming like we're in agreement
That the demon that we're fighting isn't the exact same
But if we're teaming up and carrying the weight together
We can miss a bit of back pain
And if you're into it then we can get up out the city
In a minute in the fast lane
Get hitched in a chapel in Vegas
Maybe get rich, life is a craps game
And I take my cue, from you
On what you wanna do 'bout a last name
It's not so bad to be a Watsky

[Chorus]
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

[Verse 4]
Those fires in your attic that rage without permission
Some days invade your living room or break out in the kitchen
They breeze right through the building
They just show up as they please
And then retreat like grown up children
Well how'd you like to split this L and
Tell me what you've witnessed
If the price of life is hell
Well no one ever had to sell me on how nice a fire smells

[Chorus]
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

[Bridge]
And there's so much I've been silent on
But I'll whisper every secret to you when this mic is gone
And I know you'll listen (Listen)
And I know it's different (Different)
But it gives me peace our missing pieces could be siblings
The rough nights ain't leaving, so why the hell should we?
And I say

[Chorus]
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

[Outro]
You deserve love (Welcome to the family)
You deserve love (Welcome to the family)
You deserve love (Welcome to the family)
You deserve love (Wel- wel- wel- wel-)
You deserve love (Welcome to the family)
You deserve love (Welcome to the family)
You deserve love (Welcome to the family)
