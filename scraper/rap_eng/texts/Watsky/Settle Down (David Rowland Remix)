[Remix section]
Boom, ba boom bah
I wanna settle down (Down)
Won't you settle down with me?
Settle down

[Bridge]
Boom, ba boom bah
Boom, ba boom bah
Boom, ba boom bah
Boom, ba boom bah

[Verse 1: George Watsky]
If I'm too blunt, I can mask it
If time's a blunt, I can pass it
I'd rather pass it with the passenger
Shotgun the messenger, call off the massacre
Your dude is cool, I wish I didn't have to mess with him
To tell the truth, I want the very second best for him
I'm positive I'm not a pessimist
I'm not jumpin', I'm just pissin' up the precipice
If I deafen to the definition and I never getcha
Gotta betcha I'll be better cause I metcha
But be missin', always waitin' for the day you'll be available
You keep on statin' who you're datin' ain't too dateable
But baby maybe we could pick up when this shit ends
My sixth sense says we're clickin' like Bic pens
And I don't wanna read the writing on the wall
If it's only gonna end like Annie Hall

Boom, ba boom bah
I wanna settle down (Down)
Won't you settle down with me?
Settle down
