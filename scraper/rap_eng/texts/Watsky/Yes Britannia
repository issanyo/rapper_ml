[Chorus]
I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

[Verse 1]
Yes, I’ve been a mess
With the pressure the stress
See ya never, I guess
Nevertheless, finding you I was blessed
Swear I’m trying my best
Lion inside of my chest
Trying to claw his way out
Crack my ribs, pop my lungs
I don’t know if there’s a safe route
Now—we can cut this frayed rope
Or hope and wait us to fade
Babe— after how great the ups were
We can’t be living with love when it’s lost its luster
Frosted over, busted, exhausted, ruptured
Another couple who settled for less
We want something real
A relationship
Wanna feel
And quit chasing shit
Gimme a shield
Or she’ll break me quick
And we will never be the same again

[Chorus]
I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

[Verse 2]
All we’re seekin’s a person that we can cherish
I don’t think you really want a green card marriage
Nothing is fair but you’re caring and can’t bear it
A lot of people perished tonight in Paris
The planet is a mean is a motherfucker
You wanna scream but we gotta lean on each other
We suffer and pick ourselves up off of the floor
Your dad at stage four, what could I say to support?
Can we just quit each other
The way you did cigarettes?
Up and split, cold turkey, no regrets?
I’d even miss tasting the nicotine on your breath when we kiss
I’m not ready to say good bye to you yet
Like sayonara
I don’t know if I can try tomorrow
Am I supposed to say a hallelujah
Smile I knew ya
And go on my way?

[Chorus ]
I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

[Outro ]
Oh, yes Brittania
I surrender
Book me and toss the key
Oh, yes Brittania
I’ll remember your generosity
Oh, yes Brittania
Poison testers, princes and hooligans
Oh, yes Brittania
Love's a jester, and what a fool I’ve been
