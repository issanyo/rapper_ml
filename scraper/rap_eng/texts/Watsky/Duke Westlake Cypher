All beef
Oscar Meyer, attitude
Transmogrifier, set to bragging dude

I shot the death star, I'm oh so swaggin'
I'm like Reptar, komodo dragon
And ya'll are Bambis, I'm Samwise Gamgees
Put the game on my back, like it's Frodo Baggins
Holler at your hobbit, fuck your Gollum ways
Follow me to get my ring I'll set it all ablaze
Because I'm saucy, like I'm Hollandaise
But I love rapping, like a grandma at the holidays
I love rapping like most rappers just love dough
They get the Pillsbury like Bill Murray I just flow
And crush the microphone to subatomic quarks and shit
Until it's flung across a bunch of odd coordinates
So if you're talking, put a sock or pop a cork in it
The game is finished man it's over, stick a fork in it
Or have Kavorkian escort it to the morgue
And get it's organs in the fridge and call the stork to fill the orphanage
I'm in the future chilling with my man Neo
While lames are in the past and play with Sanrio
So damn Vevo, I simply bust better
And beat every ninja turtle ever plus shredder
This nerd is blowing up, it's a phenomenon
That you couldn't copy if you kamikazed Comic-con
Ice Cube would say to come and test Compton
But I'm on a rapping bender like I'm Hunter S. Thompson
I'm on a bender, like a tiny gray antenna
Futurama baby but my tiny lame dilemma
Is that my energy is like a shot of five hour
So I guess that technically it makes me WHITE POWER
I devour every doubter I encounter catch a coward and I sit him on the counter
And I fix his little cowlick and I work with him to try to be a
Way less sucky new productive member of society
Cause there's no rivalry
I'm taking a page of the Patriots playbook and making a dynasty
And you could be singing the national anthem as if it's a minor key
I'll give you the win and I promise that I'll even throw in a tune up
I'm doing it moving I'm loving the music I'm looking for truth
I've been rocking a decade and if I get lucky I'll rock it at seventy
If I'm alive I'll be, a fucking sight to see
