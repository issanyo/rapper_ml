[Intro]
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know?

[Verse 1]
I got a real strong interest
To get you off my Internets
We get stronger, free from volunteering
Global intellect
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
I know all about that

[Hook]
Because we're beating ya
Screw printed media
If I wanna know some shit
I go to Wikipedia!
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
I know all about that

[Verse 2]
You won't see me on your message board
You lames are best ignored
I'm on the site where every lesson on the web is stored
The rest is whack trash
I get the fast facts
So you can shove them up your colon
Colon slash slash
I'm a [?]
So homie, you can talk
It's only the collective aggregate
Of human thought
You're on some other shit
Move on some other shit
Went from Sarah Palin to the Venezuelan government
I learned that mantis shrimp
Cause bubble cavitations
When they pummel with the strongest claws of all crustaceans
And we got Miley Cyrus
Yeah, it's forbidden flesh
But she's got bigger breasts
Every time I hit refresh
So get the fuck up off my Internets
Contributions free from volunteering
Global intellect
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
I know all about that

[Hook]
Because we're beating ya
Screw printed media
If I wanna know some shit
I go to Wikipedia!
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
What 'chu know about that?
I know all about that

[Verse 3]
So you can cover quick
It's just another clique
But, shit, you're dumb to think
It's only one more link
Web crack should be illegal
It's four o'clock, it's evil
But I just need to find out who played bass for Flock of Seagulls
Frank Maudsley!
He's friends with Morgan Spurlock
Who beefed with Rupert Murdoch
Who heals with root of burdock
Acorn barnacle
Quantum particle
I'm a crazy motherfucker
I'll search "random article"!
You're soft as Play-Doh
You better lay low
You're not a baller, you just changed your page to say so
Oh, you don't think I mean it?
Your paltry page, I've seen it
Word, I had to clean it for the subject-verb agreement
(Yay!)

Wiki, Wiki

Throw your Ws up!
Blocked in China!
Ha ha!
(Wiki, Wiki

Unfuckwithable!
Except, in a certain sense...
Completely fuckwithable!
I guess that's the point of Wiki technology!
