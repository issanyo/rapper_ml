[Refrain]
We're summoning spirits
Tearing the labels
Clearer than vodka
Bottle it up
Don't bottle it up

[Chorus]
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Oh no (Oh shit), oh no (Oh shit), oh no (No, no, no)

[Verse 1]
You say it's your thing to be honest
Like it's kind of this token of pride
Well, to be honest, you're kind of a goddess
But being with you kind of kills me inside
You want me to explain it, well
It's sort of this look in your eye
Like you're cooking an egg on the hood of your car 'cause you looked at it hard
But my heart is the egg and you're watching it fry
I'm not gonna cry, I'm not gonna lie, I am gonna cry
But not right here
Give me like a minute, let me get up in my feelings while I pop my beer
Shit is getting muddy, and I'm seeking out the buddy
At the bottom of the bottle but it's not quite clear
What you expect from me
When you're disrespecting me

[Chorus]
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
Oh no (Oh shit), oh no (Oh shit), oh no (No, no, no)

[Verse 2]
Wanna treat me like a dog on a leash
Well, that's your prerogative, sheesh
Or does she wanna see what we got
When the saga repeats, nada, capeesh
I'm not a complete wretch
I fetch, I sit a bit, but I'm not gonna stay
But if you wanna see me, you can see my feets
And my cute little cheeks when I'm walkin' away
You can see me sitting on the dock at the bay
You can see me lickin' on my crotch like a stray
But if you're gonna see me like a prop in a play
Gotta say, I'll be skippin' what you got for the day
Maybe you'll be thinking that I'm hot in the head
Or I'm sick of pickin' at my chicken pox in the bed
You can think what you like, I think I'll take a hike

[Bridge]
Oh no (Oh no), oh shit (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh no), oh shit (Oh shit)
It's just one small complaint, I know I am no saint
Oh no (Oh no), oh shit (Oh shit)
Oh no (Oh no), oh shit
I think we're old enough to know what we ain't

[Refrain]
We're summoning spirits
(Drink it in, drink it in, spit it out, spit it out, spit it out, spit it out, spit that shit out)
Tearing the labels
(Take it off, take 'em off, take 'em off, get it on, get it on, get this shit on)
Clearer than vodka
(Get 'em up, sit 'em up, sit 'em up, sit 'em up, put 'em down, put 'em down, put 'em down, put that shit down)

[Chorus]
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk? (Another one, let's have another)
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk? (Another one, c'mon, another one)
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk? (Another one, why not another one?)

[Outro]
Another one
Has anybody told you you're a mean ass drunk?
