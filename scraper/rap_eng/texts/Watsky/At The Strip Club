[Verse 1]

She's a true cutie
Butt makes me cry I call it a boo-hooty
Got a dude weak in the knees
When she set sail two cheeks to the breeze
She gets low, reverse vertical
Rump in descent like a jet at a terminal
She drop it to the floor like a kindergartener's shorts when he's pissing at a urinal
It's okay to brag
You're on a pole sideways like a waving flag
And I salute that hustle
The glutes and back muscle
No lie your core strength is ill and you're getting it
Sweating for your med school bills
But on the real I got dragged along
And at the strip club is where I don't belong

[Hook]

Shes grinds that pole I shed a tear (drop it)
I don't know why the hell I'm here (booty)

[Verse 2]

I'm at the Spearmint Rhino
Japanese business men smelly as whinos
And I'm not too keen
Been a couple times and it's not my scene
No doubt I like to go out
Toast with the bros where a bro can bro out
I don't need nipples like hard rubies
With big old scars underneath her large boobies
I knew we should have gone to cheesecake
Here we're either perverts or some got damn cheapskates
She stripped and I paid her
Not tipping her is like not tipping a waiter (it's rude)
So I'm tossing crumpled up ones
For an extra jiggle of those bubble butt buns
But even if I had cash it's unlikely
That I'd spend it getting women to pretend to like me

[Hook]

Shes grinds that pole I shed a tear (drop it)
I don't know why the hell I'm here (booty)
