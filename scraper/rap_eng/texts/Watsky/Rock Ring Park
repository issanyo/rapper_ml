[Intro]
A favorite gift for children all over the world is the drum

[Verse 1: Watsky]
DOPE!
Call me Homer, cause I’m gonna write an odyssey
Lots of people tend to see me as a oddity
When they see me wanna tell me what I oughta be
Pissing on the cynics and I hit em with my bodily
Functions, and lock them in the dungeon
Leaving them for years to rot with their assumptions
Got gumption
Won't get lumped in
SEEN!
Cinderella turn a fella to a pumpkin
Pump this in your whip till it's obnoxious
On Pennsylvania Ave outside of Congress
Stomping on the lawn and honking 'til the pompous
Senators yelling ta scram with an accomplice
Honest Abe we rage till were unconscious
EOM’s dope but I'ma go the longest
In a moment they’ll be staring that's a promise
Got the flow to turn a square into a rhombus
Calling Robin then we jump into the Bat Car
Call my mom and tell her I'm a fucking rap star
Light a blunt and then I pass it off to Reptar
Rep hard
Shoot another missile at the Death Star
Down to shout cuz they're extra mad
Got Barney doing dabs down in Dexter's Lab
And it's still a spare tire when I flex my abs
But I don't give a fuck cause the sex is rad. I'm
Chester Cheetah
In some fresh Adidas
And a dress shirt
Looking like an expert
People don't adjust your monitor
Whats up officer
Sorry if I babble like a drunk philosopher
E to the O-M
Me with the poem
He got the low end
So we gotta go in
The slickest showmen
How were picking off opponents
And were sick and so were foaming at the mouth
GO!

[Verse 2: Herbal T]
Flow so cool it's rocking a damn hoodie
So old school, it's shopping at Sam Goody
Beat so hard it's popping a damn woodie
While y'all express doubt like
Would he? Could he? Should he? I-
Just do it
If I dream that I can do it
Like fiend when I get to it
And my team and I pursue it
Like I'm semen
I can fluidly flow and produce mad babies
Go in the booth like I had rabies
Mouth foamin'
Name's Herbal T, if ya don't know him
He could break the ice like Damien from The Omen
EOM!
A role model and a fine fella
Bass drum breaking every bottle in your wine cellar
He run the whole game making mad beats
I got lines like I'm doing cocaine off of plaid sheets
Ace like Mellow Man with a stellar plan
To stretch the rhombus into a damn parallelogram
Then again I never been a beginner
Your girl finna get with a legitimate winner
Took her to a intimate dinner
Went to the cinema with her
Then I'ma hit it again and again
And get up in her like an enema Oh shit!
Herbal T don't play
Rap circles 'round the workers down at Chipotle
Rolled past it but fuck it I'ma be okay
Too many crabs in the bucket I'ma need Ol' Bay
AH
Like Eddie Murphy we embody the Raw
Sit Sideways like Paul; Giamatti or Wall
Extra bent, never sound like excrement
Cause me and Wax still Bill and Ted; excellent! Ay yo-
Your flow hum-drum
Where did you come from
You numb thumb
Video game playing dumb dumb
When EOM drum come
Pra-puh-pa-pum-pum
These rappers on my plate I'm eating every single crumb

[Outro]
Oh finally we must be getting closer
