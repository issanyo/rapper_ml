Adolf Hitler:
Vader… This is your last chance… Battle me… or die…

EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
DARTH VADER!
VERSUS!
ADOLF HITLER!
BEGIN!

[Adolf Hitler]
Screw you, you big black cunt!
I'll kick your balls and your face! A war on two fronts!
The Führer will crush the Dark Side! Like a rap Apartheid!
I put the germ in the Germany! I'm sick on this mic!
I beat you twice, you sellout, now you bow down to Mickey Mouse
You call yourself a Dark Lord? You couldn't even conquer Space Mountain!
You're just a sad asthmatic robot freak who needs some loving
Well I baked you something, here, pop into my oven!

[Darth Vader]
Let me paint you a picture, son
Potrait of a bitch after World War One
You were stirring up the fears of the German people
Telling the world that the Jews are evil
You wrote a little book, got'em fired up
Had a Beer Hall Putsch, got'em fired up
When your bunker started getting fired up
You put a gun in your mouth and fired up!
You dumb motherfucker, didn't Napoleon let you know?
When you conquer Russia, better pack some fucking winter clothes!
While you're fighting off Valkyrie
I got a million clones, they die for me
My bounty hunters ride for me
Yo homeboy, finish this rhyme for me!

[Boba Fett]
They call me Boba Fett, you wanna mess with me?
I'll put my balls in your mouth like boba tea
I got a jetpack, yo, you know I steal the show!
Cause when I rock the microphone I-

[Adolf Hitler]
Oh, Sieg Hell No!
You're not going to cheat me, Mister Sunglasses All the Time!
I'll take you and your new boyfriend Goofy and all your spermy soldier guys!
And throw you in a butthole in the sand!
I am Adolf!… Hitler...

WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
EEEEEEPIC RAP! BATTLES! OF HISTORY!
