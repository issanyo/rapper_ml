Georgie Porgie used his 4G
Group text to set up an orgy
It's not just a smart phone, it's a Mensa
So healthy it's made of polenta
Not expensive and it tastes great
It'll help you lose weight
Lames can't hate
The phone is a boat and the boat's ship shape
I wish we could date
It's so tip top
It's magic and amazing and it won the Civil War
Singlehandedly for the North
So hip hop, ask Rick Ross
He's got twelve
You could write to Santa, you could mug an elf
We should called it iBate
Put the phone to vibrate
Stick it in my pocket then I touch myself
Add the Bluetooth undies
And I can steady talk it up
When I be talking out my behind
Get it get it get it
And then I get it again and again
You get a dozen of them
And be buzzing like a beehive
Is like an ancient demigod
And I love it and I grovel at the feet of it
And when it rings I leave it little offerings
And all the mortal imitators got to go
It's hotter than a habenero pepper in a lava flow
I was lame and afraid
But now I get laid
And now I get paid
It's better than competitors
And spreading like an epidemic
And you better get it or you're going to get AIDS
