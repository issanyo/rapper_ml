We can let go
Find a release
We can let go
We could find peace
We could let go
We wouldn’t have greed, we could be freed
We can let go
Of all of the pain
We can let go
Of all of the blame
We can let go
See we’re the same, take off the chains
We could be changed
We can let go

You’ve gotta ease back your mind
You’ve got your own beeswax to mind
Live with your seatbacks reclined
Some people got a real axe to grind
Some people gotta relax their grind
It’s fine, I get it why you’re pissed
As long as there’s injustice you got a right to resist
People grab tightly to their right to exist
When you got nothing left to hold on to your hand becomes a fist
Cause everybody’s good and everybody’s bad
I don’t know if God is everybody’s dad
But I look into the sky, there’s something to behold
Look into someone’s eyes to look into their soul
And if they do you right, take them into your heart
And if they do you wrong, take them into your heart
And if they ask why do you do what you do take them into your head
And if they wanna do you take them into your bed

Used to be a slave to my calendar
Burned it now my life’s a much greater caliber
I just try to do no harm
Cause life’s short like T-rex arms
You gotta pick a fix that’s gonna fit your need
You got an addiction maybe you quit to get more freed
But since I’ve been too fixed on trying to succeed
My New Year’s resolution was to smoke more weed
And get lots of rest, you bet I seen the cost of stress
I sweep a heavy stack of homework off my desk
I’m getting freaking at the ayahuasca feeling Kafkaesque
A human shroomin on stage out in Santa Cruz
Grooving like I cannot lose
Sipping on a can of booze
Tripping off the avenues I came from
Thinking how much more I’ll see if I can let go

All those selfies can’t be healthy
But I won’t say it twice
I’m pretty busy trying to face my fear of what’s in the mirror
So I’ll just live my life
And if you feel a little strung out
You can all chew those cuticles, crack those knuckles too
It’s kind of beautiful
No one’s made it yet
We’ll take baby steps till we feel brand new
I said all those selfies can’t be healthy
I just said it twice
I’m pretty busy trying to face my fear of what’s in the mirror
So I’ll just live my life
And if you feel a little strung out
You can all chew those cuticles, crack those knuckles too
It’s kind of beautiful
No one’s made it yet
We’ll take baby steps, till we feel brand new
