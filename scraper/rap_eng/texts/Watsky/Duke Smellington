Don't ask me if I am an assassin
If you have to unmask me
Baby you are now in peril
Every aspect of me counts as an asset
Homie even my ass sweat goes for 20 thou a barrel

You're scowlin' and then throwing the towel in
While I enter the tao inside a temple in Shaolin bitch
You're now listening in to a loud citizen
Shouting devout discipline up on a mountain
Low key I'm a shape shifter like Loki
Locally known loco, vocally home G
Taking the A-train and I'm swinging like Duke E
Calling me Duke Smellington cause I'm a dookey
Dip like Houdini
Dick like zucchini
Sicker than leukemia
Pitiful dudes leave me alone
I get Bruce Lee'd while I sip on a brewski
And I flip through some Bukowski and kick till the brutes bleed

I don't think they really like it when I come around
But I don't think they really like it when I come around
They don't like it when I come around
They don't really like it when I come around
Like it when I come around
I don't think they really like it when I come around
I don't think they really like it when I come around
They don't really like it when I try to come around
Like it when I come around
Like it when I come around
