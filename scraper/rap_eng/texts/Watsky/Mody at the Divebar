[Verse 1]
What up ninja?
Put your feet up

I don't
Want to
Be the
Guy to
Say the night is over when it just got great -
Take a load off
And your coat off

How do ya do, do ya
Wanna get stupid cause
We're gonna go bigger than the Lone Star State

If you're dedicated to your celebrating then you'll have another and another and a hundred more

I'm making some friends
And I bet the game is intense but
I wasn't paying attention
I wonder
What's the score?

Break some bread
Shake them dreads

Your mama said I'm awesome and I'm hot
Because I'm rocking like a boss the way I'm popping off a bottletop, the
Amount of beer was breathtaking
In the morning when waking
If I get a headache I'm getting out of bed, naked
And I'm gonna stagger to the kitchen and I'll have a bit of bread and water then I'm heading back to sleep

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Lift your mug or sippy cup
Unless you're gonna cut a rug
Jitterbug, giddyup
Get it get it get it get it thug
Do your thing
Get it get it get it get it thug
Do your thing
Get it get it get it get it thug
Do your thing
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it get it get it thug
Do your thing

Some men drink and overdose
Some drink and go comatose
Some, they drink and drink and drink
Until the meet the holy ghost

Ditch the ropes
Play the field
But don't ever take that wheel
If you had the break the seal
If you meet the devil you can make that deal

Never gonna be alone with everyone around me
And I know I got a bounty I'm a lucky mothertrucker
Other people got the riches but I got a bit of liquid
And a bunch of people here to help me drink and play

Settle up the tab
Then when you're paid up
Order up a cab
Cause it's gonna save ya
Maybe you'll be getting lucky with some loving but I've got a feeling you'll be rubbing what the good lord gave ya

Maybe I'll be getting lucky with some loving but I've got a feeling I'll be rubbing what the good lord gave
