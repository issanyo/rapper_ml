[Chorus: Raquel Rodriguez]
They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold

[Verse 1: Watsky]
Got an issue but it’s getting bigger and bigger
In the beginning it was something minor
Got a rat up in my kitchen and we gotta get rid of it
So we’re bringing in a tiger
There's something inside her
Thought you were blissful
I heard you did it with a pink-handled pistol
But sadness, it tend to latch on
And it won't let go like a pitbull
Don't even know if you left a note
Should we blame the Depakote?
Or vilify the Abilify?
You were trying to find your vanilla sky
Then you unravel
Face down on rock bottom fucking chewing gravel
Because a human's so fragile - What can you do?

[Chorus 2: Raquel Rodriguez]
They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold
They press our teardrops into diamonds
But they can't change our hearts to stone
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
I know that we are not alone, we are not alone

[Verse 2: Watsky]
I know it's sappy
But I want my family to be happy
Without becoming flatter than a sheet of paper
An army of zombies shuffling through a vapor
But I know folks who found something beautiful
And they credit the pharmaceuticals
For slaying the demons that they’re running from
It might have saved their lives and I'm one of em
But there's a limit to the shit you can endure
You get a prescription and you're thinking that it’s pure
But baby maybe it’s a problem when you got a problem
And you get addicted to the cure
The spike ain’t no mystery
We’re any penny in a billion dollar industry
And there's a mothafucka' living on the hill pushing pills
Stacking bills off our misery

[Bridge: Raquel Rodriguez]
Had a teaspoon that’s full of pain
Got an ocean that’s full of sorrow
Had a teaspoon that’s full of pain
Got an ocean that’s full of sorrow

[Chorus: Raquel Rodriguez ]
[They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold
They press our teardrops into diamonds
But they can't change our hearts to stone
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
I know that we are not alone, we are not alone
