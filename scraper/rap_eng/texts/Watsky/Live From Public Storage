[Hook]
You wanna know where I live
You wanna go where a boss does it big
You want a show of my glamorous digs
Well come on in baby baby welcome to my crib
Welcome welcome to my crib, welcome to my crib
Second story penthouse, that's what it is
Rent's 80 bucks and I got no mortgage
I'm coming live from Public Storaaaage!

[Verse 1]
How's that for a fast fact
Two months passed, I packed up my hatchback
There's no plan B I want see
You take the hills, the white pickets, the palm trees
I'm balling with my kitchen and my liquor cabinet and my closet
All together with my laundry
And baby if you want to come and cuddle
You know that I could just a lay a rug over the concrete
I'm living at a low cost
Plus you know I'm really loving having no boss
My home is where I'm at at the present moment
And I'm a stone that's always rolling so I gather no moss
I'm a travel show, it's catacombs not the baddest homes
I'll be a matador for the status quo
And if we have to battle then I'll saddle up and smack attackers
I defend my castle like the Alamo
I hope to be the averagest joe with the savagest flows
So imagine this schmoe as a catalyst
Moving passionate masses with
All these mattresses propped up with packages
I don't need to brag, fuck a diva tag
I don't think you'll ever see me up in People Mag
But if paparazzi ever wants me they can stalk me to the backseat of my car and snap me in my sleeping bag

[Verse 2]

Welcome to Hustle Headquarters
Home of duffle bags, tomb of dead hoarders
It's a corrugated community, doors like ruffle chips
With the newest clean plywood floors
Each corner of my unit be, decorated beautifully
But I made it super cheap
If putting honesty over money is stupid
Then at least I've got the truth over my head and so I'm duty free
There's a kid in me who's proud of who I grew to be
Skipping like an idiot no matter what you do to me
But I never blink cause I keep missing opportunity
Thinking I've been moving since they put me in a booster seat
Man I've been moving since my parents gave these roots to me
And now I'm trying to do it right so they can root for me
Of course I've got a lot of want and I'mma pop a bottle
In a week or two when I review my resolution sheet
Because these students used to spit at me
But all the shit's forgiven cause I'm spittin' for a livin'
As if Superman just really liked to grip the mic lots
I'd still hit the pipe if it's packed with kryptonite rock
It might seem like I was here before I knew it
But when I die remember that I wasn't born into it
So don't bury me just, stuff me full of packing peanuts
And put me in a storage unit
