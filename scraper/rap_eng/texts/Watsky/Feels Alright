[Verse 1]
Did the bull crush me or do I still give a fuck?
Is my heart ripped out or just shriveled up?
Add water and it's back like a brine shrimp
Rob, pimp, fuck, steal, murder, limp by, scrimp
Welcome to your life, kid, rock bottom shithole
Grab a shovel, dig down, try to hit coal
Santa's in the North Pole doing fentanyl
No more good little boys so he meant to kill himself
But he couldn't find a vein with the hot steel
He couldn't find himself at all, bitch, he's not real

[Chorus]
Does it feel fucked up?
Does it feel fucked up?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Does it feel fucked up?
Does it feel fucked up?

[Verse 2]
I'd be real dumb if I seem super
Every day we're diggin' out our souls with an ice cream scooper
Visine might clean our tears
But I fear you'd be worse off if your sight's clear
Don't like the view here, all my pyros
Go fill your eye droppers up with some nitro'
'Glycerin, discipline, steady with the hand
Wanna have your mind blown, ready for a bang?
Eyes wide open, let me know what you hear
Might be a slight ringin' in your ears

[Refrain]
It's check-in time, how does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel? (Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?)
Feels alright
Feels alright
Feels alright

[Outro]
Pretty nice, huh?
We can go on for days like that
