[Intro]
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't think we have much to say to each other
BEN: Look, for months, all we've done is come up here and leap into bed together
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you wanna tell me about your college experience?
BEN: Oh my God. This is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. Well, I.. I was kind of upset there. I'm sorry I said those things
MRS. ROBINSON: Is it sickening for you?
BEN: It's not. I enjoy it, I look forward to it, it's the one thing I have to look forward to
MRS. ROBINSON: May I stay then?

[Chorus: Danny McClain]
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
(Can I get you back, can I, Mrs. Robinson?
Can I get you back, can I, can I?)
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Watsky]
I just graduated high school when she graduated Brown
I kicked some game the best I ever laid it down
We played around and then we got official
And when it comes to firsts, like hair, I got a fistful
I said I love you, and I'm pretty sure I meant it truly
She's still the only one I've ever said it too, she
Gave me a fever that I've still got
I find MILFs hot, and I'll yell it from the hilltop
It's not Tomato, tomahto
When it come to Demis, gimme Moore before Lovato
And if you're Demi Moore, and if I'm 24
Well, earth's a trillion years old, so what's twenty more?
But when we talk I upset your ulcer
Increase your pulse or tend to insult your
Knowledge, I apologize, it's the wrong subject
Let's not fuck this up by discussing pop culture
Remember Welcome Back Cotter?
Bridge Over Troubled Water?
Well, I don't
But, baby, that's why God invented iPhones

[Chorus: Danny McClain]
Koo-koo-ka-choo, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
(Can I get you back, can I, Mrs. Robinson?
Can I get you back, can I, can I?)
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
(Those who pray)
Hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Watsky]
You're an old wine, you're a fine cheese
At this rate you'll be Angelina by your nineties
A double dimepiece, freaking siamese
I'm fully legal, people, you can check my IDs
Be damned if I freeze, I'm a la flambe
Jay is Venti pimping, but I'm pimping Tall or Grande
He's popping Crystal, I'm sipping on some Andr√©
It's been a long day, I want to romance you, so soon I plan to
Dim all the lights and put on something we can dance to
That doesn't draw attention to my age like pan flute
So get comfy if you're chafing in that pant suit
It either makes me kinda weird or some kinda pioneer
But let me dry your tears
If you're peering in the mirror and only see the years you fear
Appearing in your face instead of Helen Mirren
Well, it's clear, you look hella nice, a younger fella's vice
And as sugar for the cougars I was on Ellen... twice

[Chorus: Danny McClain]
Where did you go, poor D'Angelo?
Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you
(Can I get you back, can I, Mrs. Robinson?
Can I get you back, can I, can I?)
Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson
(Can I get you back, can I, Mrs. Robinson?
Can I get you back, can I, can I?)
Can I get you back, Mrs. Robinson?
Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson
Hey, hey, hey -- hey, hey, hey

[Breakdown]
STOP!
When I say 'don't get,' you say 'surgery'
Don't get
Surgery
Don't get
Surgery
When I say 'age,' you say 'gracefully'
Age!
Gracefully
Age!
Gracelly
I beg you
