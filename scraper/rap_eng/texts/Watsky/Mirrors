Verse 1 | Justin Sky

Give me the gun or give me the knife and the lightning
I strike it down, put it down for the count, I’m fighting
Renegading in different ways indicating a center staging
And breaking the curtains beyond dividing (Yah!)
I waited too long to flip up the face, the mirrors I put into place
Are patient and pacing me for a rising (Rise!)
My Frankenstein be divine I gotta relay and rely
On the borderline of my death and my birth aligning
Jekyll and Hyding a pile of diamonds I’m mining
I’m digging deeper to keep up with all the fighting
And ayo Watsky, I promise that if I die in the process
I’m coming back in three days as a Nostradamus
Bruce Banner with hammers my stamina causin damage
I took it back to the shadows, I got the ammo
Blast off, ten steps and draw
Painting the Art of War, a Sun Tzu, guns too, suffer the loss (Wooo!)

Chorus:

(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors

Verse 2 | Watsky

Beware the man with the microphone, baby, pay no
Attention to what I’m sayin, no man is a prophet
Simply because he say so
So every pretender better be gettin lay low
Hell is inside of the mind, heaven is everywhere
And saturn’s ring is a halo
Hail no false messiah, my lady
Hell no the piranhas’ll drive a mercedes
You never needed em for safety
You are the savior you’ve been waiting for
There is no other to better deliver you out of hades
I got a million white stallions ready to ride for your honor
And a couple pretty fantasies I could sell ya
You are your own rebellion but then again you didn’t need me to tell ya
So come and run it down, run it down

Chorus:

(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors


Verse 3 | Sky/Watsky

Watsky:

What is the price of your life? Is it twice the price of another’s?
And how do you weigh the merits?
When all these bandits are busy crunching the numbers
And measuring by calibers and by karats

Sky:

Well, apparently the mirror can declare us heavenly
When we’re clearly lying about appearance
Down the rabbit hole a grab-and-go of cannibals
Eating our own lies disguised as transparent

Watsky:

Stare me in the eye, dare me if you like, carrying a lie
And i’ll promise that i’ll expose it

Sky:

From dawn until deceased, we’re conjuring a beast
And bombing it to peace whenever we taking notice

Watsky:

Gotta grow up and I love home, but i won’t look back

Sky:

Look to the rearview, gotta clear view, so i won’t relapse
Watsky:

We keep it movin we never tap out and step out of every trap

Both:

The mirrors we’re breaking making reflections, we’ll take it back

Chorus:

(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors

Chorus:

(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
(Let’s Rebel), These Mirrors
