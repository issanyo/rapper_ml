[Chorus]
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens

[Verse 1]
I’ve seen a person go to shows and raise a lighter app
But if you’re at my concert please don’t ever try that crap
Let’s set fire to the heavens
Turn the motherfucking speakers to 11, this is Spinal Tap
The future might defeat me, the internet can eat me
It really tastes like chicken when I bite the hand that feeds me
And I say me me, me me, play my CD, CD
Yes indeedy deedy
We be greedy and it’s tragic that we yawn
We got every gadget but don’t care there’s magic in our palm
‘Cause it’s been getting so hot, I can feel the slow rot
But let’s not die before we get to fuck a robot
Because we all need something to live for, something to live for, something to live for
We all need something to live for, something to live for

[Chorus]
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens

[Verse 2]
There was a time before the pot really got strong
Before the hippies got jobs talking long, long
Before the people talked in English out in Hong Kong
Before the holy Dalai Lama had a dot com
Before God’s dad got it on with God’s mom
Before he made us pretty things on which to drop bombs
Before the war crimes
The rich and poor times
I’m talking in the land before The Land Before Time
But then the planet lost its baby fat and got crazy
And we’ve been acting like some fraidycats a lot lately
Something’ll kill us like cigarettes or the commies maybe
Or maybe AIDS or scabies, rabies or zombie babies
Even the KGB, pray we be free from ADD, wade in and bathe in Hades
No army or Navy’s saving me
And I can’t tell our little victories from epic fails
It’s either heaven or hell and I can’t make heads or tails

[Bridge]
Are we useless?
No excuses
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces
Are we useless?
No excuses
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces
So raise your peace sign, if you’re not useless
Raise your peace sign, no excuses
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces

[Chorus]
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens
