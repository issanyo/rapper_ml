[Verse 1]
And they wonder what our parents say
And they wonder how we'll raise our children
And they tell me that I'm living with a monster
And they whisper that she took up with a villain
But I don't see dragon's scales
And I don't see claws and fangs
All I'm looking at is arms that hold me
Brown eyes that understand
And when she closed those eyes one final time no pipers came
But I know I got a love that's truer than a military sniper's aim
But we won't die in vain
Tie that chain around my waist
And pull me from the bottom of the pit of hell up to your final resting place

[Chorus 1]
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have

[Verse 2]
We were trynna run from the city
Had the hope and the pride of the kids
People wanna put up walls to divide us
Kinda fitting that we died on a bridge
Same souls, both sides of the banks
They say we're different and they're fillin in the facts
But they put the same metal in the bullets
And they put the same bullets in our backs
Kinda love that we got is one in a mill
Ain't no God that I pray to would wanna kill
It's not God but it's fear and it's politics
And a Molotov that was lit with a dollar bill
Don't say all is lost
Escape this holocaust
My God, Allah, my darling, star and crescent and my cross

[Chorus 2]
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
I will honor and be faithful
God is love and love is all we have

[Verse 3]
Where do we come from? Where do we go?
You could fill up the sea with the things I don't know
But I know what I feel and I know when it's real
And I hope that we heal
We're two drops of the blood and the tears
Over thousands of years of the clash of the steel
I'm not blind to the cycle
Weâ€™re pressed in the spine of a Bible
They define the divine by the title
But what did Christ say? To be kind to my rival
You're my kind of revival
It's true ya, my favorite Hallelujah
You my you my favorite Hallelujah

[Chorus 2]
[Outro (Chorus)]
Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have (x4)
