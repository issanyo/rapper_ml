[Chorus]
She's capsizing and the sea keeps rising and my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us, will the sea come take us when the whitecaps start to break?
Women and children
First sight of the new world

[Post-Chorus]
We tried a lot, she cried a lot
She said the struggle is normal
We act the part, I cracked her heart
Am I still one of the good ones?
(That's a good one)

[Verse 1]
You wanna brawl and crawl back into bed
But I can't move at all, I'm stalled and in my head
I'm out here playin' dead, we are not fit to duel
Our parents gave us different pistols, taught us different rules
Your father was cruel, this man you resent
Is despite your best intentions what I represent
I say it isn't right, you say you want what's right
Be prepared to fight (Be prepared to fight)

[Chorus]
She's capsizing and the sea keeps rising and my kneecaps start to shake
If I can't save us, will the sea come take us when the whitecaps start to break?
Women and children
First sight of the new world

[Post-Chorus]
The taste of cocaine
Dixieland pain, King James, Frank Ocean, and Boy Scouts
History's strange, rearranged plays
(James Franco, taking his dick out)
(That's a good one)

[Verse 2]
It's sick, the way we fight and spit
Somehow we find each other even when we're trying to quit
'Cause right behind our shit we like each other quite a bit
But I might admit, it's pitiful the way the line was split
A hundred thousand years and we're still trying to find the clit
But we don't have an ending yet we get to write the script
It isn't gonna do to move our lips, we prove it with the chips

[Chorus]
She's capsizing and the sea keeps rising and my kneecaps start to shake (Women and children)
If I can't save us, will the sea come take us when the whitecaps start to break? (Women and children)
She's capsizing and the sea keeps rising and my kneecaps start to shake (Women and children)
If I can't save us, will the sea come take us when the whitecaps start to break? (Women and children)

[Outro]
First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world
First sight of the new world
