CHORUS:
One step at a time baby it will be alright
Cause there’ll be sorry days and starry nights
And someday you’ll start to try

WAX VERSE:

Whether you’re trying to get sober or building a picket fence
Look too far forward the anxiety can get intense
One day one post at a time
You’ll be reaching your completion if you focus your mind
And eventually you’ll look at at a beautiful construction
Like Camila, Bob Vila of the musical production
My homegirls learning logic so be sure to cop it
She’s referred to as a Goddess round these parts
Now if you wanna turn profit then please start your work now
Write yourself a dumbass list and slowly work down
Many step I don took, up in these checkered vans
Innicially the count was zero far as record scans
I’m not bragging that was back when I was better man
Now It’s time to rebuild
Time to get the oil in my inner lantern refilled
Then resume walking
Till the tomb or coffin I’ll continue truth talking, ay

CHORUS:
One step at a time baby it will be alright
Cause there’ll be sorry days and starry nights
And someday you’ll start to try


WATSKY VERSE:

You gotta ease back your mind
You got your own beeswax to mind
Live with you seat backs reclined
Some people got a real axe to grind
Some people gotta relax their grind I
Used to be a slave to my calendar
Burned it now my life’s a much greater caliber I’m
Just tryin’a do less harm
Cause life’s short like T Rexx arms
Mom cries
She heard the news on uncle Micheal
Wrinkles around the corners of her twinkling eye full of tears
Ring around the rosie dosie doe the cycle the years
They don’t slow, but we’re here and so
I will raise a glass to the past and clink for tomorrow
Drink it for the ones you love don’t
Drink it for the sorrow
Link your fingers in the winter
Scummy weather but we all go there together
When the sunny summer follows
All roads get us there

CHORUS:
One step at a time baby it will be alright
Cause there’ll be sorry days and starry nights
And someday you’ll start to try

One step at a time baby it will be alright
Cause there’ll be sorry days and starry nights
And someday you’ll start to try
