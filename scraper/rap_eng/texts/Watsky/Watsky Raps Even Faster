[Verse 1]
I love all cats, even copycats
Dr seuss cats and their floppy hats
I love bob cats, I love tom cats
And your mom cats, even wombats
Love a fruitbat, hate a combat
Love a comerade, hate a comcast bill

[Verse 2]
I dont wanna battle if you really want to fight then you can
Fire at will
Lets just play pirates till
Legit we're scally wags
Hit me in the leg and put a peg in it instead
And then I bet that it'll benifit my cali swag
Hey wheres my rally rag?
Maybe my fanny pack
Winning winning winning every inning every round
When Im down Im going to hit like manny pac quiao
Im running laps, now do jumping jacks
Celebrate our friendship in a slumber party
Killing in a pillow fight and with my Rumble pack
I dont hit punching bags, I pick the pumpkin patch
Whos the little pisher so ambitious
That hes bigger than his britches
And has got two thumbs attached
O hai this guy right here

You bet ill never forget im forver indebted
And Ellen for getting the cougars to check it
Its too good to take and so I'm gonna go
Dry my tears
Gonna meet up at a 7 eleven
To pick up a dank doughnut pack
I look at myself in the glass and go "oh what"
Taking a bit of a nap
Then Im waking up for snack time
Making our way to the back of the line
Cause we dont cut
Never get up at the crack of dawn if I can help it
Wanna be able to tag along when sun is setting
Gotta be open to having a long and healthy session
Taking the love I got and try to spread it
Why would I want a pet if I couldn't even pet it?

[Verse 3]
I dont know why I'd want any lame pet, me and my pet and are winning
Its game set match
I worship Biggie, Pharoahe, Eminem
And Busta Bust and Mr. fade to black
But could I be the best ever rap threat?
Of course not silly rabbit
Billions of people and we haven't heard any animals rap yet
