[Verse 1]
Air salad
Sex vinaigrette
Intravenous internet
Jazz cigarettes
Blasé frenzy
Officer friendly
Venti Trapaccino
Gluten free Henny
Crocodile skin in the Bentley
Graveyard shift at the Denny’s
North side plenty, south side pennies
I vote Yeezus / Deez Nuts 2020
You want to run a country? That makes me shiver
Bitch I wouldn’t trust you to run with adult scissors
Flushed ass face, flash that cash
Your fleshlight wouldn’t let you smash
Collection plate passing through the church benches
Pastors pull up to their chapels in Benzes
I guess that I musta missed class that day
It’s so senseless, baby please pass that J

[Chorus]
How do you make pink lemonade?
(Pink lemons!)
How do you make pink lemonade?
(Pink lemons!)
Is it real? (Yeah!)
Is it real? (Yeah!)
Good! We only want it if it’s real!

[Verse 2]
Can’t bear a bear market with a bare body
Rich heir—hot air choking errbody
They swore you’d soar, check your sore body
See the sweat pour from each pore of your poor body
Someone wise once wrote
“Our world’s divided into two types of folk
Now there’s the type of people who divide the world into different types of people
And then there’s the type who don’t”
My uniters, crack a beer on the couch
If we’re not eye to eye I’m hearing you out
And my dividers, get your center-part ready
Cause I’ll divide your skull with a dull machete
We don’t play
Fetch or rollover
No way— it’s the cold shoulder
For Machiavellian, Martin Skhrelian suit and tie soldiers

[Chorus]
How do you make pink lemonade?
(Pink lemons!)
How do you make pink lemonade?
(Pink lemons!)
Is it real? (Yeah!)
Is it real? (Yeah!)
Good! We only want it if it’s real!

[Outro Verse]
Uh oh, uh oh
I lost my ticket to go to the gun show
I was gonna be front row
My mind it used to be sharper than CutCo
Uh oh, uh oh
Somebody came at me cutthroat
Broke open my dome and grafitti’d inside  on the stucco
Fuck no
I’m gonna shine like DayGlo
We gotta show em how the locals who come from the Bay go
Beethoven lovers or Juggalos chugging a Faygo
Welcome
Got a caseload of queso
No filet mignon but plenty of steak and potato
Pay no attention to henchmen, okay bro?
No way Jose Canseco
If I’m a shark I’m not your Great White I’m maybe a Mako
Makeover, without taking over some shit not a day go by
