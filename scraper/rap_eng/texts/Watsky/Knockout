[Verse 1: Chukwudi Hodge]
Yeah so I walked in the function solo
'Bout to do a lap, speak up to my bro, bro
Too turn't out feelin' like D'Lo
Why?
"We don't give a fuck about no ho"
Now I'm lookin' round the room and what do I see
Some pretty brown eyes and a couple D's
She just shot down a nigga flashin' hella G's
And lookin' like the perfect woman, I take two please
And I'ma put it (?)
I'm feelin' like Curry
I need what I want
And want it in a hurry
And yeah you lookin' stuck
You should be (?)
We 'bout to play a game and yeah you finna get work

[Chorus]
Let me get behind you, put it in my hands
Yeah take this shot, it's your only chance
I hope you're feelin' lucky, I sure as hell am
If you make it through, let's do it all again
It's knockout
And I'mma hit it like
It's knockout

[Verse 2: Chukwudi Hodge]
Okay, you got a little game
You gave it right back like I was asking for some change
And maybe I met my match but baby dammit I'm the flame
We should take a couple breaths before we do it all again
Usually unimpressed by what my pants are pressed into
But your body the stock that I should invest into
I'mma take your breath, cave your chest cave in, too
We playin' one on one but now you got your friend, too?
Damn
But I'm not one to boast
I'mma go ahead and let my numbers say the most
So why don't you give me yours and show me how you run a post
Or we could do like Casper and just get ghost

[Chorus]
Let me get behind you, put it in my hands
Yeah take this shot, it's your only chance
I hope you're feelin' lucky, I sure as hell am
If you make it through, let's do it all again
It's knockout
And I'mma hit it like
It's knockout

[Verse 3: Watsky]
See that behind and I'm losing my religion
I make a bee line and my movement's mad efficient
And madam I would like to stick my key into your ignition
But if we're to be explicit I want explicit permission
Purr purr kitten
I'm lickin' her fur quick if'n
I'm givin' her thumbs up
Wishin' her dump truck
Parked right on my dumbstruck face
Pardon my young buck pace
I'm startin' this race
Gunnin' 'cause I gotta be with you
Even as the gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe
I'm through
Shoo-fly me if you're not down
But if you're down let's go and throw shots down
'Til we both drown
In our thoughts and we hop town
In a boat docked in my heart
And we're not found
And I go back to the start like I'm Doc Brown
And I say "God, you're a knockout"

[Outro]
Let me get behind you
Let me get behind you
And I'mma hit it like
It's knock out
Let me get behind you
