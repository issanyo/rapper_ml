[Verse 1]
And the clouds are red and pink like they're wearing a tube of lipstick
The sun is dimming while dipping a toe into the Pacific
Just gimme a hot jacuzzi
A spliff and we'll watch a movie
I'm spiffy, man in a jiffy I'm lifted and living groovie

[Chorus]
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice

[Verse 2]
I found the fountain of youth and went skinny dipping up in it
I pick up the lucky pennies, epiphanies every minute
I run the money to Coinstar and with the cash from the ticket
I snatch my homies whatever they want at Denny's and kick it
'Til the mothafuckin' Sun rise
So many folks I love right here
But it hasn't been a good night
Until the shit gets kinda weird

[Verse 3]
I got a stylish private island inside of my mind the size of Hawaii
And when I'm vibing you're likely to find me deep in my psyche
Hiding out peeping a flying V of neon pelicans filling the psychedelic horizon like
Wow, what just happened?
I'll please have what he is having
And how can I come ride that wave?

[Chorus]
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
And I just want my slice
(just want my slice pretty please)

[Verse 4]
Don't give a damn if I'm damp, I dance in the rain
I decided to celebrate like the sky is dumping champagne on me
Paint every clap of thunder as Heaven popping a bottle
Jump in and paddle the deepest puddles
Strap on my goggles
I gotta seek what I lack
When I'm weak, gotta act
I'm a freak, it's a fact
But I can't say that I mind
Gotta leave those thoughts behind
And I hop in my car and I bob in my seat
When I'm dropping the beat as I mob the beach
And I stop and I park at the top of a cliff in the dark
And I'm digging on the stars in the sea
Shining like a fistful of diamonds
That somebody went and threw into the sky but they ricochet off
And a couple of 'em fell into the water and they sink the bottom
And I think that I saw some
But I blink and lost 'em
And I drink in the awesome view
Infinite kilometers of water and the tiny ships moving across 'em
If I'm getting money then I get it while I can
But if I'm not, I better live it up and dammit I demand
To give it every single breath I got inside of me and try to be the man

[Chorus]
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice
