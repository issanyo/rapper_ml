[Verse]
I love all cats
Even copy cats
Dr. Seuss cats
In their floppy hats
I love bobcats
I love tomcats
And your mom cats
Even wombats
Love a fruit bat
Hate a combat
Love a comerade
Hate a Comcast bill
I don’t want to battle but if you really wanna fight then you can fire at will
Let’s just play pirates 'till
Legit we’re scallywags
Hit me in the leg and put a peg in it instead
And then I bet that it’ll benefit my Cali swag
Hey where’s my rally rag?
Maybe my fanny pack
Winning winning winning
Every inning, every round
And when I’m down I’m gonna hit like Manny Pacquiao
I’m running laps now
Do jumping jacks
Celebrate our friendship in a slumber party
Killing in a pillow-fight and with my Rumble Pak
I don’t hit punching bags
I pick the pumpkin patch
Who’s the little pisher so ambitious that he’s bigger than his britches
And has got two thumbs attached?
O hai!
This guy right here!
Credit to Reddit you bet I’ll never forget I’m forever indebted
And Ellen for getting the cougars to check it
It’s too good to take and so I’m gonna go dry my tears
Gonna meet up at a 7-Eleven to pick up a dank donut pack
I look at myself in the glass and go ‘Oh what?!’
Taking a bit of a nap, then I’m waking up for snack time
Making our way to the back of line, ’cause we don’t cut
Never get up at the crack of dawn if I can help it
Wanna be able to tag along when sun is setting
Gotta be open to having a long and healthy session
Taking the love I got and then I try to spread it
Why would I want a pet if I can’t even pet it?
I don’t know! I don’t want any lame pet
Me and my pet are winning
It’s game, set, match
I worship Biggie, Pharoahe, Eminem, and Busta Bust and Mr. Fade to Black
But could I be the Best Ever rap threat?
Of course I’m not, silly rabbit!
There’s billions of people
And we haven’t heard any animals rap yet

Good girl
