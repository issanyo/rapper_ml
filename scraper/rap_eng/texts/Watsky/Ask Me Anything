[Verse 1: Watsky]
You want to know
Then I'll try
To tell you how it is
There
Isn't ever much
Cracking the coconut hoping to get me to open wide
Now
If you want to know
Then all you have to do is ask me
I don't have a thing to hide
I walk in the office of my orthodontist and without a warning
My jawbone is already pried
And honestly, I've never lied
Second to none
If I pucker my lips and I lickem I'm looking to kick an impeccable pun
I don't kick it like Beckham
I kick it like Beckham a decade ago when I run my mouth
You think I'm a megalo-maniac
A lout?
I'll be begging to differ
Try sticking a flute or a piccolo
Up a particular part of your pecker
But I'll let you pick it though
I'm out
I'll chuck up a deuce-- a bigalow
And be cracking a Michelob
And I give a toast
And I trickle a bit in the gutter for all of my bigger bros
And I walk it out
Now
If you want to know
Then all you have to do is ask me
Not a thing to hide
I'm trying to be totally open like all the time
Now
If you want to know
Now
Then all you have to do is ask me
Not a thing to hide
Now
Not one damn thing
Now
Not one damn thing
And I'm glad I got all of these ears around
Me
Not one damn thing
And I'm glad I got all of these ears around
