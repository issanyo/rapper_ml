"There's like only one bully in my class
He just thinks he's all cool, he thinks he's smarter than me
He thinks a lot of things!
You know, you know Brazilian ju jitsu right?
A self defense class?"
"Hey talk quiet though so they don't hear us."
"You know Brazilian ju jitsu class right? Self defense?"
"Yeah"
"Well guess what, I'm taking them and-
And after a while, he's gonna get his surprise attack
He's really gonna get it
Oh I'll tell you he's really gonna get a surprise attack
He won't even expect it!"
