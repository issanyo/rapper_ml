[Intro]
The First time I listened to Watsky
I was like, "He sounds like a fucking honkey"
And I don't even think he knows
But, then, I listened to him some more times
And, don't tell anybody about this
But, he kinda goes hard, though

[Verse]
I'm Driving to the burbs and before I am coming back
I'm pulling in your driveway and I'm rolling front to back
I'm shifting forward then reverse my car a bunch
As if my Subaru's a wiener getting sexy with your cul-de-sac
L-O-L-O-L I'm from the avenue
A rapping labradoodle, half a wasp and half a jew
If you's a Saturday cartoon I'll smack ya black and blue
I'm acking ratchet with Daffy Duck and snacking on rabbit stew
Yabba Dabba Doo, I gotta lick my lips
Smoke a bowl with Yogi Bear, I'm sticking up your pic-a-nics
All of this is in my head, my 'maginations colorful
Crayons on the brain, I'll scribble silly shit all on my skull
Holy cow, I don't think they're gonna hold me down
I recommend you listen to the record in a theater with the Dolby sound
And I'm sipping on the coldest round
With the preppies and the Goldie Locks
But I bet a bunch of 100's everybody's gonna scatter any minute when the police knocks
Like "Sorry ociffer, that getting sloshed occurred
But rastas broke in and they made us all smoke lots of herb"
I'm sorry, Honest Abe
Popo don't take me away way
Cause if you ever try to lock me up, I'm pleading cray cray
And then they'll all say may day
May day oh what did we do
He be creepy givin' me the heeby jeebies, he be Hebrew
He be robo, beep boop beep boop, please untie me he's behind me
What's 50 grand to a motherfucker like me, can you please remind me?
A lot. That's..a life changing amount of money for normal people
