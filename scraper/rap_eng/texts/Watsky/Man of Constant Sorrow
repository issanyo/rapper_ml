[Chorus 1]
In constant sorrow
I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my day
I bid farewell to San Francisco
The place where I was born and raised
(The place where he was borned and raised)

[Verse 1]
I'm almost never in the city I was born and bred in anymore but everywhere I tour
I'm repping black and orange
I'm trekking back and forth forgetting what I'm packing for
I have to travel more and add a couple saddle sores
Got these battle scars from riding in the cattle car
You're noshing on some caviar
I'm gnawing on your apple cores
Mental checklist
You're Mr. International
But last I checked I'm Mr. Continental Breakfast
Condiments and Chex mix
Condoms but I'm sexless
But I'm optimistic
I'll dismiss my bigger issues
If I fit into some mistress like the long block in Tetris
I was roaming in Wyoming when the popo were arresting me
I told em questing for my destiny-- Noo
I always end up in detention cause I'm itching
And I'm searching for adventure and each city I go

[Chorus 2]
It's fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die (die) upon this train
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train)

[Verse 2]
Papa is a head doctor. I think he's Socrates
But he can't get my twin brother to want to talk to me
But I rarely try and so it's partly my hippocracy
Gotta a couple secrets and I keep them under lock and key
Push em down occasionally sparking up the broccoli
I'd rather take my lumps display dirty laundry
Than pop a pill and stagger through this day like I'm zombie
Like I'm some unhappy and unnatural Blondie Abercrombie model with the fake-est fucking smile plastered on me
I might be a sarcastic bastard, but I'm never plastic
And my masochist tendency's
Imagining disaster and then mastering its recipe
So I hit the road out of necessity to stop guarding
And I'll hop out and run if ever my car is not starting
For now I'm not charging
All my meals are business meals
Cause my business is not starving

[Chorus 3]
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
(While he is sleeping in his grave)

[Verse 3]
4AM again, the radio alarm is kicking in
I've been to every shitty old La Quinta Inn in Michigan
Hitting the ignition till I'm stripping off my Michelins
If you catch me bitching then remind me
How magnificent my life is
How the struggle's priceless
Cause I got those lovely troubles that you couldn't put a damper on
Each unhappy camper on this planet is a champion
If you think you're hopeless and you'll never be like Kobe and you
And youâ€™ve got an empty mantle cause you never won a trophy man
Well you still won that marathon of swimming that fallopian
And I've learned lot I could lose
Cause there's a lot of dead sperm in the socks that I've used
Who would love to be the feet in the socks in my shoes
So better get to walking till those spoiled feet are bruised
And then sow your royal oats till you're growing something new

[Chorus 4]
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore
(That golden California shore)
