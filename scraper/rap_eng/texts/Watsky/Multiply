What am I made of?
As a whole?

Dirty hormones
Plus some flesh
Plus a soul

Times the times I floated times the times I sank
Times when I levitated times when I tanked
Times when I was more jackass than Steve-O
Times when I treated life like a TiVo
Napped all day to  skip through the weak shit
Knocked the half empty glass over and I spilled all my secrets

Times when I check myself as I grow older
Times when I broke my neck to cry on my own shoulder
Soaking wet, when I skip through the sprinklers
They tried to throw shade, but it slipped through their fingers
Times I got paid for the rhymes that I'm spitting
Times I got laid and really long times that I didn't
Times when I didn't fit and hid it behind obstacles
Times the ambulances times the hospitals
Stack it all, reduce the fractions, put that shit in brackets
Subtract any exaggerations I added, and there you have it, boys and girls. There's the path
Don't forget to show your math

I try to tell them we won't die
I'll show you how we multiply / x4
