[Chorus]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on

[Verse 1]:
I don't really give a damn about a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow if it's being on a billboard
From the moment I saw Chali 2na rocking under the multi-colored lighting in concert at the Fillmore
I'd kill for
Punks and b-girls
Never gonna matter I'll be spitting like a water cannon making waves I'm an orca, I recommend a parka you'll be feeling like you're in the front row at Seaworld
Gonna hike it till I make it, it's a good call
Taking the mic and I spike it like a football
Like a running back
Like I'm under the gun but I'm never gonna crack
Never could fall
It's like I'm Arnold I'm
Skinny but I'm picking up a barbell fine
Gonna make it putting my pen to the paper poppin' out a novel in a minute
Like I'm R.L. Stine
Gotta try because I got a fool's chance
Grab the mic at a middle school dance
Take it from the DJ and I rap until they pull the plug out on me to stop it or until I get pants'ed
Fuck it, they can pull the plug I'm gonna kick it acapella, Dockers at my ankles, and I tell em what I'm feeling
Even if nobody is listening I yell it to the ceiling and I celebrate the fact that I'm alive and I'm breathing

[Chorus]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on
