If I get too stoned
Then you're gonna have to take me home
And when we're alone
I'll just fall into your loving arms

If I get too stoned
Then you're gonna have to take me home
And when we're alone
I'll just fall into your loving arms

Every time I think about her
I must tuck my tip up under my belt loop
She chops me down and builds me up again in one fell swoop
Superhuman mademoiselle
Only you could crack my shell when you cooly cast your spell
I'm not truly acting well
It's a crying shame
Her name overheats my mindframe till my brain leaps up into flames
Cranium like a lion's mane
And though it's a quiet pain
Deep in my vein, I can attain higher planes through the creep of my migraines
It's quite plain, you got eyes you can see it (see it)
She's beyond the horizon so be it (so be it)
No one's a deity we can agree it
But to reiterate what I stated she is the shit (sheeeeit)
And I'd like to think I'm hard to break
But I saw her and my jaw dropped and I start to shake
And I saw red and I dropped dead
On the autopsy the doc said it was too much booty for one little heart to take

[Hook]

We could split a spliff until we're shit faced
And then maybe we could go to fifth base
Cause I want you bad I got a sick case
And I'm willing if I got to give chase
But we could quit if it's a quick pace
I'm a tortoise I don't run a hare's race
But if you don't want me you could hit space
And then spray me with a can of bear mace
You give me that rare taste
Of all the trimmings that the rest lack
Coming up like a staircase
And you got me floating like a jetpack
Got me turned on like an iMac
No other women got me sidetracked
And I think about it and I think about it
Baby meeting you was such a life hack
And when we're together it's a fucking pleasure
Every single moment is a delight
But if we be knowing that the feel is slowing
Then to keep it going would it be right?
And if we fight and it seems like we know we might
Never see quite in the same light
Then i'll go home and I'll smoke somethin' till I sleep tight
But I'll keep trying
I sees it like "Please why'd we
Decide to dive in the deep" and I'm dying to find reasons to
Jump in your shoes, cover my bruises and ball
Better to love and then lose then do nothing at all

[Hook]

I like it
I love it
