[Chorus]

Who should I believe? Please tell me why
No one saw what happened there that night
The only clue’s to look you in the eye
Those gray and cloudy eyes

[Verse 1]

All the people run and take a side
Don’t nobody want to break their stride
But what if we were to make a mistake
With stakes this high?
No one’s ever gonna truly heal
You want to gamble; who do you let deal?
Whose future rep do we ruin?
Let’s spin that roulette wheel!

It has never been a secret: cowards posin’ as leaders seek
To pervert their power and prey on the weak

But I also
Know
With an accusation, a wound is made
You wouldn’t be the first to wield a rumor
As a blade!

Fingers pointed like bayonets
What’s it cost you to make a threat?
Don’t be shy come on place your bet
If you roll snake eyes you don’t pay that debt

Let’s set it straight:
Only one things certain, that some… body is the serpent
And were… you to win that verdict
Slither out and take your curtain call

Lookin’ for a bit of mercy for she
Shoulderin’ a heavy burden with
Nothin’ but cursed choices
Silence is the worst of all

[Chorus]

Who should I believe? Please tell me why
Know one saw what happened there that night
The only clue’s to look you in the eye
Those gray and cloudy eyes

[Verse 2]

I do not share your load on this journey
I do not wear black robes in the court
So I will not bang the gavel; I won’t lock your shackles
This is not my trash to sort

Folks who think they’ve found truth tend to tremble
Any time the ground beneath them shakes
Find the closest rock to cling to
Lock your fingers into fissures where it breaks

But what if turns out things aren’t as we know ‘em
Reapin’ the harvest we’ve sown; Here in this garden of stone
What kind of hideous, selfish obsidian
Heart do I own?

Could you forgive me if my hesitation
Demands that you weather this hardship alone?
How could you pardon my tone?
I know that hatred can scar
That it can carve to the bone

So would somebody let me know how do we
Take shit back to when life was all wonderful?
Get to buildin’ a home or a chateau we
Can get comfortable feeling uncomfortable
I’m not talkin’ a Huxtable

What a difficult and retched affair
People seekin’ anything solid
To keep them from scratchin’ at air
