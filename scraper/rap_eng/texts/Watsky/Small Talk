[Verse 1]

Something happened ya, tweet that shit
Self-gratify ya, eat that shit
Snap that shit, and keep that pic
And check that she seen it in recent clicks
For the fact that I’m fiending I bleed that shit
Cuz I lack self-esteem and I need that shit
So I only write what I think they’ll like online as I hide behind the screen’s black tint
Don’t read that shit, just like that shit
Don’t think for yourself, just swipe that shit
Swipe left that shit, swipe right that shit
Filter that shit, lo-fi that shit
Praise celebrities, glorify that shit
With a microchip in your iphone 6
Fuck Justin Bieber, fuck Michael Vick
Work a 9 to 5 then slice your wrist
You’ve never seen a cyborg quite like me
Put my lifestyle up on that hifi-stream
Hook my lifeline up to that wifi screen
Then charge me up or I might not breathe:
Badaboom badabing
Take a pulse of my veins through a USB
Put my life on the web through a new XP
Till I’m losing my self like who is he?

All in my screen, telling me all the shit I’m supposed to be (x4)

[Verse 2 - Watsky]

Member Member when we used to spark?
The tender embers, late night in Dolores park?
But now the technorati sharks come feed up on the carcus of the city which was once the titty that we fed upon, they're gone before its dark
Deep in the grass, they view us in their Google Glass
My past is passing faster than N judah on the track
I'm no Naruto on the track, not known as Budah with the backpack
Still that goofy carpet bag or rocking Fubu to his class
But past our mad infatuation, Frisco is no granite statute
Atchoo, bless you, yes you better have a pass before it met you
Past Crayola days, when colors came in happy packs
When the Sunset was still Irish, when the Panhandle was black
Before yuppies were accumulating in the foggy cracks of San Fran like a layer of fine artesian plaque
Before the crackheads scudded lower Market, puddled piss, where we marched for Iraq
These wheels were set in motion, but now it's me and Frak making..

[Verse 3 - Frak]

Small talkers, identify the mold
With the texture of a techy trying to gentrify your home
They wrecking-ball the old then mechanize the soul
If you’re looking for them this is how you recognize em’ though
Fedora and some billabong, granola that’s vanilla almond, frozen yogurt gin n tonic, trying to get their frizbee on
At cafés with cigarettes, getting fake shit off their chest, well I guess it’s making sense why they call the valley silicon
Like what else is new? Looking over their hood from the bedroom view
Watching this melting pot melt into homogenous Elmer’s glue
No radio rap, only MF doom
No staying in the trap, I need elbow room
Always giving their opinion like they think it’s hella different like life is an endless yelp review
I feel some type of way, I’m tired of life as a biker lane, their chai lattes and IPAs, ironic eye-frames and license plates
Immersed in a hipster renaissance
They’re turning this city to Megabots
Got me talking to a stove like I’m fetty wap
While they’re knocking down homes like lego blocks
X marks the spot where the treasure’s hot
Where the culture breathes like a netty pot
Till it’s credit or debit or vacate the premise before the rent swells like a tetanus shot
Instagram burritos and the murals by the station
While kicking out the very individuals who make them
Idealize the culture with a swipe and a vacation
When I graduate will I become the man that I am blaming?
Its just capitalism, well that’s masterminded
By caste systems castrated and classified
Watch the whiteness congeal, that’s flash pasteurized
Your community’s changing, watch it flash past your eyes
