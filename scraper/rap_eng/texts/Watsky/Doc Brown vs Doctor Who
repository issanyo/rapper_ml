[Verse 1: The 10th Doctor]
Actually, if you dont mind it's just the Doctor
Dosen't even really matter who
Who am I even talking to? Oh yes, you
The wannabe Einstein minus the 'stache
Travels through time but with no class
I'm saving the world while you dilly-dally
You can't even invent a way out of Hill Valley
And calm down will you Everything is going to be fine
You're not going to tear any wonky holes
In any fabric of space and time
Actually it's a lot more like a rug really, nevermind
Let's just say there's an infinite number of me
Simultaneously kicking your ass with rhyme

[Verse 2: Doc Brown]
Great Scott you're great! Not
I spit it hot and generate way more power
Than one point twenty one gigawatts
I'm not sure what sort of scientific authority you purport to be
But I'm a real doctor where'd you get your degree?
Despite all of your companions
You couldn't be having less sex
I don't know what's lamer your fans or your special effects
You don't get another turn to debate
Time to face your permanent fate
Now Dalek my balls!

[Dalek]
EXTERMINATE

[The 10th Doctor]
I'm going to die
At least, this version of me
Perhaps you'd like another
Prepare to meet your destiny

[Verse 3: The 4th Doctor]
I'm a mystical medical doc at the pinnacle shifting my physical form
You're a possibly pedophilic individual
Who should have never been born
You got your knickers in a twist
While you're sucking on my Piccadilly
But I'm a lot lot different
Cause you're a pitiful hillbilly
Hanging with an oedipal kid
Who's a bawk bawk chicken

[Marty McFly]
Nobody calls me chicken

[Verse 4: Doc Brown]
This is between us Scarfy
Don't try to out-rhyme me
You'll find I'm as grimy as any slimy time-limey
I'll use your port-o-potty time machine as my latrine
You're not a cat with nine lives
You're a pussy with thirteen

WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
