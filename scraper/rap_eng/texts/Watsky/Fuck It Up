[Intro]
Oh no, hey
Oh no, hey

[Chorus]
Excuse me while I fuck it up
Please excuse me while I fuck it up
Excuse me while I fuck it up
Again

[Verse 1]
Wanna crash in slow-mo (Oh no)
Repeat our patterns and blow, oh no
I’m all plaid, you’re all mad
The amateur saboteur's 'bout to go pro
What I know is that the people aren't runnin' the show
Any minute to another they come and they go
And they never gonna get what the government owe
So do what you gotta to pick up enough of the dough
I don't see the benefit of us comin' to blows
Give it a second, honey, I bet I'll be stubbin' my toe
What we got doesn’t come by a lot
So we shoot every shot to work it out
But I’m dumb in love, out of touch
Is it too much or not enough?

[Chorus]
Please excuse me while I fuck it up
Please excuse me while I fuck it up
I was just getting to know you

[Verse 2]
Wanna burn the house down (Oh yeah)
Pack up and get outta town (Oh yeah)
Drive without turning around
Arrive ridin' the waves and hold hands while we drown
Ain't no limit, never heard of high ceilings
Never timid, it’s a certified G thing
Even after getting thirty-five bee stings
Still the motherfucker wouldn't hurt a fly's feelings
But being nice is sometimes not so nice
It’s not so nice, no, no (Nice)
Got dropped, didn't stop
I was caught up in my life like
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Hey, better suck it up, buttercup
But I'd rather not look sharp
I was lookin' out for love and I puckered up
Better buckle up 'cause I fuck it up again and again
And I’m sick of picking up my stupid-ass heart each time

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time

[Chorus]
Excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Please excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Please excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Again
Fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Again

[Outro]
Yeah
Hey
Hey, again
Hoo
