[Intro]

[Verse 1: George Watsky]
Ellen Parsons is this young attorney I wish I was dating
Who's busting the wealthy Arthur Frobisher for shady trading
She's under Patty Hewes, a devilish manipulator but no better litigator in the business
But Ellen only got the gig cause the sis of her fiancee David is the case's biggest witness
They subpoena Gregory Molina who's a man that David's sister Kate banged in West Palm Beach
Where he'd seen Frobisher getting in a limo talking to a sketchy fella from the SEC
Patty blackmails Arthur's lawyer who blows his brains out, though what sucks is Ellen sees his body in Patty's office and Patty sends a man to murder Ellen cause she knows too much
Cause Frobisher's attorney had Malina killed but not before he made a tape that and gave it to his good friend Kate - - when David gets it
Frobisher allows a dirty cop to kill him by beating him with a pair a bookends
But they don't find the tape, it's hidden in the murder weapon - -
Ellen is accused and the cop's at large
But Ellen gets it and uses the evidence as leverage over Patty to defend herself drop the charge

[Verse 2]
Now Ellen's super pissed cause Patty tried to snuff her out
At the firm as a federal informant set on bringing Patty Hewes to justice now
Chemist Daniel Purcell's wife is strangled he's the suspect one
Patty represents him cause he fathered her emo teenaged son
Now Ellen's FBI, Patty takes on UNR, Purcell's former company Appalachia and evading like the haters and the brutes they are
Our boy Frobisher is back, and riddled with guilt, so he said he'll represent the plaintiff's side
But the evidence that Patty has is inadmissible and hoping that the judge'll budge and take a bribe
Changed her mind, doesn't so the federalies fail to pin a thing on her, she's vows to win
Cause Frobisher's a fraud but Purcell's not, his boss goes down with him

[Verse 3]
Ellen's working for the district, but kinda on one team
With Patty busting the Madoff-like mega Tobin Ponzi scheme
I gotta mention Patty's second in command, Tom Shayes who's got great faith in the courts
Patty said he's never gonna get his name on the door
But he finally does, but when it rains then it pours
Tom was a Tobin investor who lost over seventy percent of all the crap he owned in the bust
But he keeps it a secret from Patty and when all of his remaining crap hit's the fan then he blows Patty's trust
Everybody's looking for the hidden cash but its tough cause it's stashed in a bank in the islands
Using Papa Tobin's illegitimate daughter as a mule
But then they kill her when she's gonna to break her silence
And the Tobin attorney is just a faker posing as a lawyer by the name is Wiggins When the Tobin's know it they disown him and they don't forgive him so he burns 'em and betrays the family to gain immunity and diss 'em
The Tobins fall apart and fight until they're split four ways
Joe Tobin hits the bottle then he snaps and drowns poor Shayes
