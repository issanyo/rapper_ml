[Verse 1]
Mister Softee’s back
The block under attack
Frozen Mickey Mouse head massacre
Mac cherry matte glossed lips smack
Please mind the thigh gap
Pierced venus fly trap
French kiss french roast french toast light frap
French-goodbye the nightcap
Full Japanese sleeves
Brazilian hair weaves and bazillionaire thieves
Heavenly heavily creased Canal Street queen
25 if a fiend
Maybe 40 if she’s clean
Shorty in black, Nightmare Before Christmas, ripped, safety-pinned jeans
Obscenely scene art crowd
Bean-to- bar-insert- fart-sound
Far out, daddy-o
Daddy issues
Data dumpster
Dumb on purpose
Optimistic prophylactic purchase
Swipe right, minimal hesitation
Possible digital penetration
Popsicle in the butthole?
Wait—where are you going?
Wait. Wait. Please wait. Wait!
My safeword is “safeword”
Say word if that’s hot
Word
Not!
What?
Stop! how much you fuckin got?
Lay up off your cash, your pants, and throw the Her Pleasure trojans on the top!
Drop, kiss the pavement, spread your mothafucking cheeks and make em talk
“wawawawawah”
The familiar wa-wa- walk of shame
Glittering city of dreams
Sex is on the breeze
Must be springtime in the city
