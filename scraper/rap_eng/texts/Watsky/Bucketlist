TO BE INTRO
So much to do
So much to see
So much for you
So much for me
So much to do and see
So much for you and me

Verse
When I'm thirty five I'll learn to work a potter's wheel
When I'm forty I'll forty go streaking at a soccerfield
And if they try to tackle me then I'll distract em flapping my arms and happily shrieking like a coccatiel
When I'm sixty I'll get really really fat
And then go back to skinny really really fast
And then go skydiving with no parachute and glide around like I'm a flying squirrel with my skinflaps
Like a creepy Aladdin (Just need my Jasmine)
Cause there's no feat you can't achieve if you believe it can happen
If yesterday's a pain in the ass
Tomorrow's an aspirin
And you might be feeling better than you ever could imagine
At seventy I'll rock sandals with black socks
When I'm eighty I'll try heroin or crack rocks
Or both-- And mix em in a smoothie
I'll be old and toothless
And I'll be feeling groovy
I'll make out with school teachers
Chill at nude beaches
And free the zoo creatures
And if they tell me it's a issue for my health
I'll tell em bitch I'm ninety you can kindly fuck yourself
I'm just being really really really really really really really real right now
And so I just plan on doing what I really really really really feel like now

VERSE 2
I probably won't bang all the girls I liked in high school
Although that would be quite cool
But I'll list their names out on some wide rule
Paper
And I'll call each one of them and tell them that I really would have liked to love em
Back in the day
Not to be a creeper obviously
Just to see who'd respond positively
And just take it from there
We'll just take it from there
I hope you answer my prayers
Cause
We don't know what the future holds
