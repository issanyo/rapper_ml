[Chorus]
Here, take my career
Give her your health
Let me have the love you share
I've been alone for a long time
Picked the faint praise of strangers
Over one who truly cares
He keeps the faith in a dark room
Fingers twitching like moth wings
Hoping to matter
But he can't see how he matters to you
You can't drink wine or coffee
And you're stuck with a body
That fights each small request you make

[Verse 1]
I got that brown grass dogs come pee on
Your grass so bright it's neon
Green and tie-dye and grows a mile high
We'll be betrayed by the seeds that we sow
Tiny blades grow and stab the earth from below
Your dying dreams bleeding out in the snow
You with the crumbling hips
She sees strangers eat oranges and clenches her fists
In these miles of highway
You're the prettiest pileup that I've ever glimpsed
Iâ€™m lost in the awful withdrawals
Grass seems much greener beyond these old walls
But my worries so small
When I walk through those hospital halls

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Tiny prayers you whisper to yourself (3x)
