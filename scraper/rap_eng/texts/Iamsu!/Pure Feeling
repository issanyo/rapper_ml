[Hook]
Just give me that pure feeling
Vi-i-i-ibe, oh woah

[Verse 1]
[?], give me that big bag
Six speed Neymar kick that
Six speed Neymar kick that
Six speed Neymar kick that
Running 'em, spend that
Running 'em, spend that
Saks Fifth, I make impact
Saks Fifth, I make impact
Saks Fifth, I make impact
You can never put me in a box, yeah
My name carry weight but I don't need a spot, yeah
I got that work, I make it jump right out the pot, yeah
You try to run off with my swagger but I caught ya, ya
Still mix that sherbert with gelato 31
Work like I lost but I know I already won
Make 60k up in a weekend
Fell in that rabbit hole, I'm living in the deep end
Break ya back with this acrobatic flip
Money like this piece of dough
Got a way they ain't seen before
Roll it up like a vehicle
Never cannot be compared to these niggas
I'm rarer than these niggas
Livin and breathin I'm air to these niggas
Im jackin up the spot, you can share with me nigga
For clarity nigga, let's get it

[Hook]
Just give me that pure feeling
Vi-i-i-ibe, oh woah
