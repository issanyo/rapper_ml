[Intro: Iamsu!]
Skip
I can see it in these niggas faces
One false move their career get erased
I drank my tequila to the neck, no chase
I go to the dealer, write a check, then scrape

[Verse 1: Skipper]
Hey, ooh
This some soldier shit
Woah, woah, woah
Look, get on your grind nigga
You wanna shine nigga
It's your time nigga
Keep that money on your mind nigga
Sometimes you gotta remind niggas
Nobody fucking with my niggas
Yeah it's gang shit, my niggas
HBK shit, my niggas
I might slide nigga, skrrt
Always down to ride nigga
And my bitch just love to ride nigga
And my bitch just love to dive nigga
Real nigga, I'mma dive in it
Real niggas take their time
I don't give a fuck I slide in
You a mess, yeah I'm fine with it

[Bridge: Skipper]
Yeah I'm fine with it
You a dime baby
Take your time baby
Yeah you mine baby
I'm on the grind baby
You tryna shine baby
Get your mind right
I think the time right

[Verse 2: Iamsu]
Suzy
I know the time right
This is the head crack, you know I had to roll the dice
Unbutton the flannel more so I can show the ice
It was all love until they seen the feature price, skip
I can see it in these niggas faces
One false move their career get erased
I drank my tequila to the neck, no chase
I go to the dealer, write a check, then scrape
HBK gang, don't disrespect it
Multicolored stones on my mofucking necklace
Baby go stupid with the neck, she a vetran
3 AM we jumping in an Uber, fuck breakfast, bitch

[Outro: Iamsu!]
Ay, we so presedential
Uh, yeah, I'm too influential
Oh, yeah, kill an instrumental
And if I like your beat enough I steal your instrumental
I'm with Maya going dumb in a Phantom
I'm a fly, to Atlanta
I be wearing all designer like I'm Saman
I'mma hit Westville then do damage
Woo, let's get it
