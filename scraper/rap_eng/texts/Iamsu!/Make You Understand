[Hook: Iamsu!]
I can count my real ones on one hand
You start touching bands, you going to understand
See me, I’m just minding my business
Excuse me, I’m just riding around getting it
Said it all before, I’m going to say it all again
Just to make you understand
More bottles on the way, I’ve got one in each hand
‘Gotta make you understand’

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]​​
Hold-up, step back, who are you?
Young Su
Heartbreak, TIU
You know I can hit the mark every single time
Suzy hit it out the park when it’s on the line
They don’t even know me, telling stories about the boy
Don’t believe the hype, they ain’t ever been to war
Trying to give me fifteen, I need forty eight minutes
And the way they act man it’s like they hate winning
We want this forever
Said that from the beginning
Henny got my head spinning
Gold grilling when I’m grinning
You don’t even know all the bullshit I’ve been in
In the Chally peeling out every corner that I’ve been in

[Hook: Iamsu!]
I can count my real ones on one hand
You start touching things, you going to understand
See me, I’m just minding my business
Excuse me, I’m just riding around getting it
Said it all before, I’m going to say it all again
Just to make you understand
More bottles on the way, I’ve got one in each hand
‘Gotta make you understand’

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Word around the city that I’m hot now
Ride around the corner, shut the block down
Ice so cold, like Moscow
Fuck a hater, I don’t listen when they talk now
All my real ones, they know what it is
Ain’t no time for small talk, I want to do it big
I’m the first one who brought a plaque to the crib
Me and Kool John brought it back to the rich
Gone for a minute, now I’m back in the mix
Young Sudi man, young hammer with the hits
On the move, it’s a different city every night
And I still pray to God before every flight

[Hook: Iamsu!]
I can count my real ones on one hand
You start touching things, you going to understand
See me, I’m just minding my business
Excuse me, I’m just riding around getting it
Said it all before, I’m going to say it all again
Just to make you understand
More bottles on the way, I’ve got one in each hand
‘Gotta make you understand’
