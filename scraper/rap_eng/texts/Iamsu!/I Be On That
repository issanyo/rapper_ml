[IamSu Verse]

You know im sippin on fiji
Everyday geechi, pitchin the game like im eg
Ro, we will be reachin, always recording but ain't nothing decent
So, im watchin the game, plotting on how im gone knock em unconscious
They lack inspiration, lack motivation people be meeting new concepts
New process, black tee with the anaconda pockets
Bay vest with the green camouflagin
Top floor in the suite how im lodgin
Haters throwing cheap shots but in dodgin
They want to hold a nigga back but im rising
Surprising, im shinin
Blowin strong your highness, ugh
And im chewing these beats like a back molar
Always in the gutter like a bad bowler
Flow colder south pole'n
Two tone rolex and it swag golden


[Chorus]

I be on that i be on that
Getting to the money i be on that
I be on that i be on that
Stand next to me get a contact
I be on that i be on that
Getting to the money i be on that
I be on that i be on that
Never hate the next man im beyond that


[Dave Steezy Verse]

Getting to the money i be on that
If i roll up it is strong pack
Me and Sudi cop bape a nudie
You lame niggas ain't on that, aye
Illin im dope, lift in the smoke (lift in the smoke)
Its that high grade, my eyes glazed and yall light weight
Name a nigga stuntin at my age
The flow colder than ice skate
Just give me weed and myspace
Plant lifes like rs
I show love dont see why hate, ugh (why hate, ugh)
And the click is legit (and the click is legit)
Her life is a bitch (her life is a bitch)
So i grind all the time (so i grind all the time)
And hope to be rich
And hope to be living with niggas who real
And that got me like i got them
OG jordans got them
Fuck nigga im not bitch and


[Chorus]

I be on that i be on that
Getting to the money i be on that
I be on that i be on that
Stand next to me get a contact
I be on that i be on that
Getting to the money i be on that
I be on that i be on that
Never hate the next man im beyond that
