[Hook]
Ice, polar
Yeezy, solar
Told my, ex girl, I need, closure
Walk in right inside the jungle with y'all no emotion
Bitch I'm headed to the top, I feel I'm getting closer
RIP my fallen soldiers
Wishing you could see me now just so I could show you
How I took over the game, they don't even know it
How I took over the game, they don't even know it

[Verse 1]
Money, flowing
Henny, pouring
Ice on, my neck, like it's, snowing
Yeezy's, glowing
Easy, going
Had to boss my life up, I needed a promotion
Funny how they don't remember all the bad times
Look straight in the mirror say this was my last time
Swear to God that I could do this with my hands tied
I like asparagus and chicken that is pan fried
Told my chef hook it up, whole gang in the cut
Had to cut they down, wait can't let the fame build me up
They gon' hang me out to dry if I don't make another one
I know my brothers with me dog, I love 'em like my mother's son
Working like a sweatshop, I refuse to be a bum
Eatin' I won't leave a crumb
Even when the season done
Leave it up to me and I'mma keep it up, I'll teach you somethin'
I'm a teacher's son
So the route was not an easy one
Let's get it

[Verse 2]
I'm so good inside my of city, don't need passes
Cartier that sit on my face like I need glasses
I'm on the road to my dream, come chase with me
Forward lifestyle, work hard, stay busy
I got, more bounce to the ounce in me
Proud of my brother's success, I live without envy
In a time where they wanna divide us
Things get dark, feel like no one can guide us
Don't feel alone, don't be afraid, don't let them demons get you
Keep your mentality, be silent, and remain official
Make your reality a product of a focused vision
Move on the low, watch who you trust because these niggas be bitches
I talk to God, he see my heart, and now I feel a difference
I got examples 'round me either dead or they in prison
I use my voice to shine a light and see a better Richmond
And then a whole world, I'mma keep it so thorough, ay
