[Hook x2: Kool John]
Girl shake it like a tambourine
Girl shake it like a tambourine
Me and my niggas that's a lot of green
Girl you better [?]

[Verse 1: Kool John]
Girl shake it like a tambourine
Bounce that booty like a trampoline
You's too thick you gotta jump to fit up in them jeans
I'm that nigga I can help uplift your self esteem
Smoking lemonade, I'm higher than an astroid
Like Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, I'm a bad boy
You a bad bitch, that's why them bitches mad at you
Throw that ass back, I'm finna swing this dick at you
I'm real nasty, I like ass cheeks
Head in the front and I hit it in the backseat
I'm trying to get them double M's like Maybach
Bend it over girl, I like the way you shake that
And I'mma beat it like I'm Michael
I'mma beat it like I'm Michael
She threw that pussy at me like a spiral
Post that ass on Instagram, it's finna go viral

Girl shake it like a tambourine

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
And you already know me
I just want my friends in my PJ
No checkpoint, Gucci bag, pj's
[?] by what I wear I make them sell more
I might charge a store just because I'm in a store
Pull up, pull up, you know everybody with me
Girls screaming shotgun while I'm trying to find Ricky
Oh my car, my fault, I'm sorry
I'm not use to being rich and its model Ferraris
I wish take you all but I can't
Like the guard in women's prisons I'm the man
I'm walking ovations, I make them stand
I get standing ovations in my Lamb
Diamonds red like my chain be under the boat
Niggas hate, I'm like whatever makes it float
I'm with John we scraping from coast to coast
Your coast to coast, I'm something like space ghost
Now [?]
