[Chorus: Jace]
Rollin', got a sale
For you she might, for me she said she will
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Gang outside, nigga tell me what the deal
I said it's rollin', got a sale
For you she might, for me she said she will
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Whole gang outside like nigga what the deal
Rollin', got a sale
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Gang outside, you already know the deal nigga

[Verse 1: Jace]
Rollin', off a pill
I was poppin' way before I got a deal
I said I'm holding out for real
Function in the city and the gang's all here
Said we in this bitch like a pregnancy
Like my bitch the shape lowercase letter B
Yeah chest flat, but her ass fat
Said Su roll the gas, nigga pass that
In the foreign so I don't know where to ash at
'06 Young Money, where the cash at?
Said a model broad, smashed that
Gang nigga, yeah yeah
Tell me where the stash at now or it's gat gat
We don't like talk like librarians
It ain't Halloween so why you acting scary then
ABC Bape tee what I'm buried in
You a rat and a pussy, Tom and Jerry them
All I'm sayin' is

[Chorus: Jace]
Rollin', got a sale
For you she might, for me she said she will
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Gang outside, nigga tell me what the deal
I said it's rollin', got a sale
For you she might, for me she said she will
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Whole gang outside like nigga what the deal
Rollin', got a sale
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Gang outside, you already know the deal nigga

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I got a knack for the friendzone
But I get out the same way that I got in though
Summer '17 I'm 'bout to turn up the lake
So Spring '17 I'm 'bout to rack up my cake
Six-speed, got it with no apologies
Mixed breed, got it, started to follow me
Brown skin, baby I don't discriminate
Three or four options like it's a lemon date
Made my name now I'm too poppin' to pay for features
Haters try to destroy me, they get an A for "eef"-ort
An E for effort, I call the movie like Roger Ebert
Jeepers creepers, six speeders and the leave it to beavers
Counted me out like Yeezy when he signed to Adidas
I'm a player, I ain't got it, I'ma mouthpiece it
More money 'cause money is more power
That's why me and my guys like four tires

[Chorus: Jace]
Rollin', got a sale
For you she might, for me she said she will
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Gang outside, nigga tell me what the deal
I said it's rollin', got a sale
For you she might, for me she said she will
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Whole gang outside like nigga what the deal
Rollin', got a sale
This ain't a movie, it's too real
Gang outside, you already know the deal nigga

[Outro: Jace]
Rollin', got a sale
Movie, it's too real
Gang outside nigga
Rollin', got a sale
For you she might for me she say she will
Too real, whole gang outside like nigga what the deal
