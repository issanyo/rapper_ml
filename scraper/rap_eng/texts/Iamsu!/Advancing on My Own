[Hook]
They don't understand the wave I'm on
So I just keep advancing on my own
You don't know what you got until it's gone
You don't know what you got until it's gone

[Bridge]
So I just keep dancing, I'mma keep on singing
Trap steady jumping, I got three phones ringing
Diamonds dancing on my necklace like Chris Breezy
Baby are you trying to take a flight just to see me

[Verse 1]
Don't carry weight, don't got no save, no
I'm in my swing, Jose Canseco
Move out the way, I'm with my gang, oh
You wanna hang, just for the fame, though
Yeah, I don't need no partners
No, I don't drink no vodka
Lone dreadlock like rasta
In my city, plugged in like mafia
Out here my flow and your flow, that's obvious
She wanna see me, she goin' [?], lobby up
I might give your girl the boot like LaTavia
Plus my gang tight, you can never tie me up

[Bridge]
So I'mma keep dancing, I'mma keep on singing
Trap steady jumping, I got three phones ringing
Diamonds dancing on my necklace like Chris Breezy
Baby are you trying to take a flight just to see me

[Hook]
They don't understand the wave I'm on
So I just keep advancing on my own
You don't know what you got until it's gone
You don't know what you got until it's gone

[Verse 2]
I, can't, vibe, with the fake shit
How, do you, have, all these day 1's
They want it so overused, what about the zero
I think you got it confused, focus on dinero
I see [?] on paper views
I be pulling chicks in twos
I'm up bright and early on the clock, won't never hit the snooze
If you snooze, then you lose
I got too, much to do
I pull up, I collect
Call you back, in a few

[Pre-Bridge]
That's the way my life goes
I guess my life is life goals
Grew up in the bay, home of the side show
But they don't know that I can do this with my eyes closed

[Bridge]
So I'mma keep dancing, I'mma keep on singing
Trap steady jumping, I got three phones ringing
Diamonds dancing on my necklace like Chris Breezy
Baby are you trying to take a flight just to see me

[Hook]
They don't understand the wave I'm on
So I just keep advancing on my own
You don't know what you got until it's gone
You don't know what you got until it's gone
