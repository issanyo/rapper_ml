I never knew the way
HBK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Started out the basement, never had a basement hold up
European waitress
Caught up in the matrix
Now I'm pellegrino sippin'
Trippin' off my extension
I was rappin for the sport but they never paid attention
So I made niggas listen
It's really ironic cause now made niggas listen
And tell me I got next
I got 2 chainz on the text
Yohji Yamamoto I could fashionably flex
I be out in Soho multi thousand dollar checks
But you can't buy respect or love
Hollywood model girls do designer drugs
High and fly all of the above
So street smart i outta be a thug
Fame feel so good that it outta be a drug
The feeling so electric that I'm standing by the plug
Shit It's only so much that I could tell these fools
I got familiar with money women,cause they barely knew

Hook
I took off now I won't land (HBK)
I said I took off now I won't land
(and I can't quit all I know is gang)
Won't land, won't land, now I won't land
(HBK yeah you know how we play)
Won't land, won't land, now I won't land
(and I can't quit all I know is gang)

Verse 2

Hoppin' off a plane
Black Versace frames
Same one's that Biggie wore the day that he was slain
Million carbon copy's I'm just prayin for some change
Haters in a money drought they prayin that we make it rain
But I'm a different type of mind
A different type of grind
A different type of jewelry give a different type of shine
Rap about my life and you just rap a bunch of lies
Just to make these women think that you a different type of guy
I'm a different type of fly
First class even
Labels on my neck I swear I took mad meetings
But I won't sign a deal until my whole team eatin'
And I don't mean vegan
Flow so wavy that I'm 30,000 leanin'
Cold 2 below and I don't mean anemic
Stupid complicated but they swear that niggas easy
Head on propeller trying to figure out the reasons
Rocking bape everyday so I'm steezing no teasing

Hook x2
