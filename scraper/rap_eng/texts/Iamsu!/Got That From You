[Hook: Omar Kadir]
Man I roll with the stars while you stare at the moon
We working too hard, we got too much to lose
All that I got, know I got with my crew
Everything in this world, man except for your girl
You know I got that from you
You
And I got that from you
You

[Verse 1: Omar Kadir]
OG kush from the store, roll up, 50th floor, go up
She wants a tour
We got champagne to pour if not order some more
Couple things that I'd do to that body
I'd break it in two for the way that you move
It's so wet I might need a canoe, I'm paddling through
I'm looking for bad ones and you fit the shoe
Baby you got the juice
And I got it too, don't get too confused

[Hook]
Man I roll with the stars while you stare at the moon
We working too hard, we got too much to lose
All that I got, know I got with my crew
Everything in this world, man except for your girl
You know I got that from you
You
And I got that from you
You

[Verse 2: Omar Kadir]
See the body a Mazi that engine Ferrari
Said he the plug but she callin' me papi
No he can't stop me, I sting like I'm Ali
My shit's off the Richter might cause a tsunami
I'm about to slide in
Well before the night ends
It's only right that you tell your boyfriend goodbye
Now meet me outside
Screaming oh my, oh my, oh
Dirty words in my ear
Yellin' oh my, oh my, oh
Watch her work in the mirror

[Hook]
Man I roll with the stars while you stare at the moon
We working too hard, we got too much to lose
All that I got, know I got with my crew
Everything in this world, man except for your girl
You know I got that from you
You
And I got that from you
You
Would you stop playin'?

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
I want Y-O-U
Your boyfriend is a lame
You know we not quite cool
And I'm the ice in the cup
I be lightin' 'em up
If bein' bad was a crime then I'd be writin' you up
And throwin' you in a clinker
I'm a hell of a thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker
And a bit of a drinker
I'm a beast, I'm a creature
The most not the least of
On the grind like crazy show my ass on my features, ayy
Let me take you on a Heartbreak holiday
Low key maybe just a hideaway
Boss like Hugo, fly as ever you know
Killin' these rappers but not attendin' the funeral
She dress like a Goddess
I guess God was her stylist
Young and gettin' money now we wildin'
Turn it up a notch then

[Hook]
Man I roll with the stars while you stare at the moon
We working too hard, we got too much to lose
All that I got, know I got with my crew
Everything in this world, man except for your girl
You know I got that from you
You
And I got that from you
You

[Outro: Omar Kadir]
Screaming oh my, oh my, oh
Yellin' oh my, oh my, oh
