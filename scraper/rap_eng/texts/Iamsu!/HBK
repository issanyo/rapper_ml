[Intro]
Heartbreak niggas we make money
B drop that shit

[Verse 1: HBK CJ]
Take the black off of my skin still be the realest nigga out
While they go against the gang I’m still trying to figure out
Held accountable for my success to get a mil in my account
You’re pulling ‘em in, I’m pulling ‘em out
You running them in, I’m running them out
What you know about
Young nigga smoking cookie dough
Purple, purple got me feeling like I’m Whoopi Gold
Dreadlocks got me feeling like Whoopi
I told the devil I don’t care if you took me
I don’t care how you see me
Just don’t overlook me
I’m paying my bills, not caring who looking
Told my momma I’mma buy a house, put the crying out
Wash away her tears, and still dry ‘em out

[Hook x2: Iamsu!]
Heartbreak niggas we make money
Got cake, on me
Don't hate, on me
Don't play, no we don't play
No we don't play, no we don't play
No we don't

[Verse 2: HBK CJ]
I see the haters in my rear view I think my L’s suspended
I bust a bitch on 46 it’s already got hella tickets
I be in the club with my nigga Mike-E buying hella bottles when he drunk
Remembering when we used to peace up now we get as much [?] as we want
Was raised throughout the slumps
I slanged ‘em out the trunk
Put this bitch on iTunes we made it what we want
They saying what they want
We made it sneaking up behind DJ Amen and having him replay it that the plan
TYCA, THCJ, smoking on some shit that make my d-ay replay
She wanted to meet Suzy, he give her that debate
We can’t relay, if she ain’t prepaid
I use a blunt for a [?] these niggas tripping making bitches wishes into existence
I tell ‘em come to their senses, pulling bottles out
Real niggas understand what I’m talking ‘bout
Talking ‘bout the gang

[Hook x2: Iamsu!]
Heartbreak niggas we make money
Got cake, on me
Don't hate, on me
Don't play, no we don't play
No we don't play, no we don't play
No we don't

[Verse 3: HBK CJ]
Ain’t I still doing what I used to
New school niggas running YouTube
Old school niggas showing mad love
Got the same attitude as I had ‘fore I blew through
Smoke, smoking enough [?] to blow the roof down
If you was number one you number two now
[?] CJ do some shit and bring the news out
Man I swear these niggas looking for me like [?]
Heartbreak Gang mami
Don’t hate on me, don’t blink ‘round me
Got a military work ethic
And if it ain’t HBK, it ain’t worth repping
My net worth is my network
If you want my bands cut the check first
These niggas asking where the fuck I’ve been
I scope this shit out for a year, I was a redshirt

[Hook: Iamsu!]
Heartbreak niggas we make money
Got cake, on me
Don't hate, on me
Don't play, no we don't play
No we don't play, no we don't play
No we don't
