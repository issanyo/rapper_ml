[Verse 1: Jay Ant]
See these niggas crazy
They gotta be crazy
So what you niggas want from me, I'm sorry
Is that what you want from me, an apology
Cause honestly
I don't give a fuck what you niggas want from me
I don't give a damn, give a fuck what you niggas want, I don't
But I choose to be cordial
I choose to chill
Most niggas get emotional, you tell 'em what's real
I tell a nigga to kick it like [?] and he gone
Leave him in the pass like [?]
I'm focused, I'm building a business now
You niggas still playing and I'm getting offended now, so fuck
I'm more mad at the paper on my Now and Laters
Than I am at you fakers
And you weak ass haters

[Hook: HBK CJ]
I can't go back to yesterday
I can't go back
Cause I was a different person then
And I won't go back
That's why I keep a weed rolled
I gotta keep a little weed rolled

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Evaluate your life
What's the difference between me and you
Someone told me I wasn't putting on
I said how
I put on cologne every day
I put on fly shit every day
You know
I put the rich on every day
I put my chain on every day, don't I
How I don't put on

[Hook: HBK CJ]
I can't go back to yesterday
I can't go back
Cause I was a different person then
And I won't go back
That's why I keep a weed rolled
I gotta keep a little weed rolled

[Verse 3: HBK CJ]
Slicker than wax when it hit your chance
Catch your breath, flow got more sharps than a Kitchenette set
Riding with the best clique, tired of listening to that
My opinion is a pen and pad
Did I offend you or you mad
Must be living in the past
Cause I gave you all I had
And you still hate for what I have
Keep it litted like a match
Keep it litted like my hash
You be eating Mickey D's
How you [?]
And the city see the flash from the cameras
You don't wanna want it even if you had a fan
Used to have a bitch from Tijuana with Phantom
Now I only see that girl at night like I be vamping
Damn, I'm tired of these rappers saying how they used to have it
You hit it hard as you can, but you see you hitting a badminton
Cash written rules while my cash live it through
We the same but we fight
We like Ken and Ryu

[Hook: HBK CJ]
I can't go back to yesterday
I can't go back
Cause I was a different person then
And I won't go back
That's why I keep a weed rolled
I gotta keep a little weed rolled
