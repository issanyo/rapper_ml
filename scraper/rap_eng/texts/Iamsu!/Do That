[Hook: Jay Ant]
Still mobbin' with the click, yeah
Keep talking that shit, yeah
And niggas know what it is
Slid through the strip
Had to get this bitch lit, yeah
Hey, you already know how I do it
Young nigga I do that, yeah
Hey, you already know how I do it
Young nigga I do that, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay Ant]
Now I max like the theater
If you can snatch it from me
You can be with her, huh
Like fuck the dumb shit
California player, from the Himalayans
Balling cunger cross the block of prayer
Nigga fuck you haters, I be feeling...
I be feeling high enough to fly
Like if I stop smoking, I would fall about the sky, ah
These bitches don't know about me
I told her learn the alphabet, because she don't know about a G,ah
I don't know nothing if it ain't my business
I ain't even see it, if I was a witness,(laugh)
Hate me now or hate me later
You can say whatever either way you still a hater, ah
I don't give a fuck about a lot of thangs
I just want the money, you can keep the fame

[Hook]

[Verse 2: IamSU!]
Yeah
Young Bayllian, dig me no Paleon-tologist
Go reefer, no tolerance
Go out and get work and pass out in it
Young Dominic, catch up, no condiment
From the Bay where I be going dumb and ghost riding whips
If it ain't about money, we ain't co-signing it
Don't spit, I be rhymer than nigga idda went
Like around the whole world, homie, 7 continents
Swagged out every day, Imma start modellin'
Got the juice like Pac, tell 'em come bottle it
We could tell the fake fans, homie when you spotting it
Got the shit tied up, homie I be knottin' it
Work around like nodelist
I be balling honey, I deserve a bobble head, uh
In the game like a controller
Tell her drop it to the floor for a young soldier, ah
