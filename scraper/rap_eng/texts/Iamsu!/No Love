[Verse 1]
I'm like haha at you rappers
Niggas destined for disaster
I'm the best of the best
Nigga Tiger at the Masters, no green coat
Yo, quick as Usain Bolt
They love me in all hoods
Go places they can't go
Maybe because I keep it real
I don't have no use to lie
I ain't here to be no savior
Cause they all get crucified
But respect me cause I'm different
Cut from a different cloth
Everybody say they gassing
We don't need no more exhaust
The world is so polluted
But who am I to judge
I got my inner demons
Mind's haunted like the Grudge
Trying to escape from my past
But it's chasing me so fast
People so used to the old me
And they say the new me clash
Just a healthy transformation
In response to all y'all hating
Middle finger to you niggas
I don't need your authorization
The world is all for the taking
I guess it's time to take it
Enough history in the making
Nigga it's time to make it
Suzie!

[Hook x2]
Ain't no love in the bay
All over hate and niggas dying every day
I don't know about y'all
But ima get paid
And i don't know where I'm going
But I know I'm here to stay

[Verse 2]
In this life you get no re-do's
If you hungry they won't feed you
People so consumed with evil
Niggas shooting up them needles
And the shit that gets injected
Is exactly what's reflected
And the music I'm projecting
While your CD's get ejected
By the streets I was elected
To release this final message
And to [?] what my request is
Peace to my investors
The time that I invested
You'd be wise if would had kept it
You were sleeping on me
But advise a narcoleptic, to wake up
I shake up, everything, that they've seen
Backpack rapper and hood nigga
I lie some where in between
There's not another on this planet
Who reminds myself of muah
With a overbearing confidence
That some call a facade
Always worried about somebody
Nigga I just do my job
So making record after record
Has really never been a prob
While you struggle to write
I encourage to fight
Tell them to shine bright
While they discover the light
Suzie!

[Hook x2]
Ain't no love in the bay
All over hate and niggas dying every day
I don't know about y'all
But ima get paid
And i don't know where I'm going
But I know I'm here to stay
