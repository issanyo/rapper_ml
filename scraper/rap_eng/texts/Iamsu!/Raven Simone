[Intro]

[Verse 1: Iamsu]
Try the cheat code access denied
Run the BM shit like the FBI
Niggas think they know about Suzy
Ain't nobody fuckin' with him is the best reply
These niggas must be high, off PCP
My flow poison, BBD
Nigga ain't shit sweet
You can bank that G
Get played like The Parkers on BET
Drop it o a nigga head like a DDT
My whole clique eat no EBT
My CD free but you should see thes fees
No video on the TV screen
Heart breakers I'm Pat Riley
My paper came fold no oragami
I stay in between bread like cold salami
With a couple bad bitches posted by me
If you post it mami you get toasted mami
(?) mami get a wet tsunami
Nigga bet that ill be on a jet where flying
While your homie's probably somewhere testifying
Bitch nigga snitch nigga get no respect
Im that type to slap a nigga off reflex
Came up out this bitch like a c-sec
Niggas tweeting fake shit and then delete that
HBK gang or repeat that
Niggas throwing cheap shots I just eat that
Whoever you make it is you can meet that
But it ain't me I tell my niggas where the beef at
All about my notes C flat B flats
Off the wall like a young Mike Jack
With a flow for like three stacks
Do a show for like three stacks

[Hook]
Check the status my team on
Pockets like Raven Simone
In my city I'm king kong
Tell them hatin' niggas dream on
Check the status my team on
Pockets like Raven Simone
In my city I'm king kong
Double cup no lean though
Check the status my team on
Pockets like Raven Simone
In my city I'm king kong
Tell them hatin' niggas dream on
Check the status my team on (Yeah)
Pockets like Raven Simone (Yeah)
In my city I'm king kong
Double cup no lean though

[Verse 2: Erk Tha Jerk]
You know me (Uh!) Su lowkey
Hugh Heffboy I got two on me
And in my Benz nigga I should have a suit on
Pocket full of money I got some (?) on me
I like nasty hoes I like fancy clothes
Bet Sudan a nigga action halt ?
Over on a railroad like monopoly
I'm collecting two hunnid like I'm pass and go
I'm better, look at my leather
Million making mitch boy look at my fashon
Look into the future you can see it through my glasses
Look and eye me, look at my chances
Im smoking good my weed insane I'm at Benihana's
I'm at PF Changs
I'm riding around the city I'm meeting things
So high I might be seeing things
She bust it wide, pull it open
She so addicted she overdosing
I'm double cup, I'm motorboatin'
She up and down, we rollercoastin'
My PYT dont wanna see me go
I be on the grind no PTO
Live and livin color like the TV show
No fake shit here no (?)
I be up dog, she be (?)
Copped some full of new shit real dope nigga (nigga)
(?) when you found somebody realer(realer)
This king shit for you little gorillas
I'm good (Im good)
I'm straight
My will, is up (is up)
Im toasted, Im baked
I'm trill, as fuck
