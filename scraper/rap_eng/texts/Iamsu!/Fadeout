[Intro]
Southside

[Verse 1]
Like the fire boy let me be blind with you
Go ahead and roll up
You got that paper
Make a girl wanna blow with you
Go ahead and roll up
I wanna take you
Take - take you to my lips you dream
Go ahead and roll up
So won't you lay back
Lay - lay back watch me do my thing

[Hook]
I inhale you, then I fadeout, fadeout, fadeout
Must've been a smoke cloud, smoke cloud, smoke cloud
Boy you got that fadeout, fadeout, fadeout
Getting heavy in the top bass
All night baby don't stop
Boy you got that fadeout
You make me, make me fadeout (that’s what they all do)
You make me, make me fadeout

[Verse 2]
Ooh
Fake ass, rap niggas played out
Get it one time, fall back till I fadeout
Going in asap, never stayed out
If she start bugging
I'm a have to put the Raid out
Oh, insecticide
The best from the west, her respect aside
I'm the type, get the address, request a ride
Bring it to the hotel, make it testify
Like God, screaming out God
HBK yeah, I love my squad
Long ass flowing girl till it hit the floor
I just made like six figures on tour, ooh
And I'm down to spend it all, too
Looking for the turn up, yeah you better cross too
She got a clique for the homies tell em fall through
Get high, get drunk
What we all do

[Hook]
I inhale you, then I fadeout, fadeout, fadeout
Must've been a smoke cloud, smoke cloud, smoke cloud (Mmmm)
Boy you got that fadeout, fadeout, fadeout
Getting heavy in the top bass
All night baby don't stop
Boy you got that fadeout
You make me, make me fadeout
You make me, make me fadeout

[Verse 3]
In my chest let it burn
Set this love a blaze
Go ahead and roll up
It's you and me
No one else in this rotation babe (babe, babe)
Go ahead and roll up
I wanna take you
Take - take you to my lips you dream
Go ahead and roll up (oh)
So lay back
Lay - lay back watch me do my thing

[Hook]
I inhale you, then I fadeout, fadeout, fadeout (then I fadeout yeah)
Must've been a smoke cloud, smoke cloud, smoke cloud (smoke cloud, yeah, yeah)
Boy you got that fadeout, fadeout, fadeout (let me tell you how to hit it babe)
Get heavy in the top brass (feel it straight up babe)
All night baby don't stop (oh please don’t stop)
Boy you got that fadeout
You make me, make me fadeout
You make me, make me fadeout
