[Hook: YMTK  (IamSu!)]
Finna blow a scholarship (what did she blow)
You ain't gotta flex if you ain't got the shit ( no, no)
I ain't gotta flaw, I acknowledge it (yeah)
Liquor in my system and I'm confident (aaaah)
Confident, Liquor in my system and I'm confident (aaah)
Confident, Liquor in my system and I'm confident (aaah)

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
When they run out of Henny , now we drinking Remy
Yacht party in L.A., whole gang with me
Mmm yeah , you ain't bout it girl, you play too much
Sneaking in the festival , you got that bottle tucked
And them boys irrelevant, so why you brought 'em up
And even Freddy vs. Jason couldn't startle us
And if you know some women, call some models up
But I guarantee they already follow us
Mmm yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Welcome to a Heartbreak party
Tryna leave here with somebody
One shot, it don't do shit for me
Let me see you fill your cup up shorty

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
We gon' turn it up in no time
Lil' Henny make her bounce like a lowrider
Damn baby you are so fire
From the bay, but I ain't never had a ghostwriter
They know about the boy no matter where they from
A lot of money in this world you better make you some
I can’t relate to any of these haters cuz I ain’t one
You know where I came from, where the game from
