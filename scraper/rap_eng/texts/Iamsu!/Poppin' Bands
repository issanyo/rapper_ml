[Intro]
Yeah
Trippy niggas
Yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
Heartbreakers we back
Hoe niggas be quiet
Pull up in that lack
Can't keep up if you tried
Everything is that dope
I heard that you might die
All my homies gone ride
All my homies get fried
Like chicken at Popeyes
Won't recognise my grind
But recognise my mind
They blowin' up my line
I'm holdin' down my section
I represent my side
My shoestrings untied
With peanut butter inside, uh
Trippy
Coming straight up out of Rich City
I'm drunk off that Remy
And my car goes with my pennies
My flow retarded like Timmy
Tell them haters come get me
Off 9 shots, like 50
With a G-Unit like 50

[Hook]
Got bands all on me
My whole city on me
We top floor, you cheap
Got flatscreens in my suite
We goin' all night long
My whole gang, we on
Got money all in my pocket
Got money calling my phone
I'm poppin' bands
I'm poppin' bands
I'm poppin' bands
I'm poppin' bands

[Verse 2]
On me, I got a thirty bands on me
I been poppin' Zan and rubber bands
10 Dom bottles on me
I ain't sippin' on no lean, but I'm rolling up OG
Yellow bones and yellow cold, no yellow stones on me
Rollin'
Through the city, 1-50 in my duffle bag
Drop a 50 piece off, count a 100 grams
I'm blowing cash
All my girls live extra fast
S class, best grass
You see the smoke fly, when I press the gas
I'm out, out, out
I made 2 mil in the south
I got famous in the drought
Yeah I'm turning bitches out, burn, go
I'm the man with all this weed
I ain't play no games, I got crazy bands on me
I'm poppin' bands

[Hook]
Got bands all on me
My whole city on me
We top floor, you cheap
Got flatscreens in my suite
We goin' all night long
My whole gang, we on
Got money all in my pocket
Got money calling my phone
I'm poppin' bands
I'm poppin' bands
I'm poppin' bands
I'm poppin' bands
