[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
She wanna leave with a star
We rockin' out like guitar
Buy every drink at the bar
This the way it go
They ready to see a boy
I'm makin' money like Floyd
These bitches got me annoyed
This the way it go
I'm rackin' money like leaves
She beggin' me not to leave
I've got bills to pay, mouths to feed
My agents wiring big amounts to me
Fuck a cosign, I got dead lines to meet
Chuga chuga chuga chuga train comin'
Full speed ain't nothin' stoppin' this motherfucker
I broke free I'm a renegade
They bring it straight to the industry
Now it's time to let me in the game
Shit changed, 2012 MDA
Time to ball like the NBA
Steph Curry, KD, Chris Paul, John Wall, or somethin'
Sylvester paintings on my halls in my walls lil mama
Digi dash, my foreign showin' kilometers
Feel like I'm going 200 miles per hour
But we ain't runnin' from nobody
Even if they was chasin' me
I'm the greatest, like Muhammad
Don't want no problems
Toleratin' no violence
Yeah my tape rewindin' in my face
They smiling in my lane
I'm flying kingdom, I'm a tyrant
I got bling around my collar, yeah
I'm at the top and I ain't comin' down
Woah
Walk through my city, but I run it now
I used to play my position
Now I want every position
I'm at the door like "who is it?"
Bitch, I'm reloaded, new vision
It's time to go through specifics
All this flow on the Pacific
I can't believe that you doubted me
But for that you're forgiven
This shit is crazy

[Hook]
I don't know what I'm finna do with this rap game
They thought I would act a fool when the cash came
But I'm investing
I need a new California, hoe, not a Mustang
I'm looking at the scenario, it's disgusting
But I know one thing, I ain't slowing down for nothing
Given the circumstances I should probably be afraid
It's so much extra curricular, shit I don't entertain

[Verse 2]
No shooter, gang bang
I influence youth brains
I've been playing bro, but really I've been goin' through thangs
Like, these niggas tryna hold me back
New fans don't know he raps
True fans want the OG back
A billion a half, yeah the game owe me that
I don't want no feed back
Yeah
Just point me in the right direction
The best thing going in my section
Man, I swear this shit crazy

[Hook]
I don't know what I'm finna do with this rap game
They thought I would act a fool when the cash came
But I'm investing
I need a new California, hoe, not a Mustang
I'm looking at the scenario, it's disgusting
But I know one thing, I ain't slowing down for nothing
Given the circumstances I should probably be afraid
It's so much extra curricular, shit I don't entertain
