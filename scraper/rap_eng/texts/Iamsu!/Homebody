[Verse 1: Julian Write]
I like a home body, not that type I ball tight
Mediax lenin' baby can you own yours right
Said she goes on sak and stay, use to live on campus
Tryna put you on, they just tryna put you on the matrics
Try to have it by my side, wepin' throw the traffic
Bangs pulling round the house and maybe callin' bastards
All the girls like the boy with body in go
Now I'm on the radio like how the hell it happen?
Next girl tight to the man that she with
Wherever you about to do just do it quick
How they consider they goin'? Can't just get a banch life?
Girl, you know you want this dick

No it don't matter, whatever it is
If I was at ‘em, I give ‘em a risk (I would)
But she get it if she want it, from the night 'til the mornin'
Baby here, 3 things on my mind, this pussy is mine
And we, party to my car on that side to me
And I will save my side bitch in any time (Yeah)
Just to run with you, across the finish line
And now I ride with my baby but she in a driver
And she still a rider, be and stay survival
HBK the hardest, but she know that's savage
She ain't trippin' on me, but she know we'll be grindin', eyy
No boo, know this'll drive me
Though I got that money, that becomes [?]
Get that finer pussy, I'ma leave that pussy drive me
She would get that Suzy [?]

She the one I'm spendin' wax on
I ain't gotta worry 'bout where she at cuz she's at home
That kind of women with a back bone
To my side, I'm with my main when she need me, hit the bad phone
Hold it down, from the aim to the beam
Yeah the boy it's on this spending but this cause an European
And now she a home body, she might end up as my beam
Even rap roll class, throw it up like she's bulimic ha
Try to leave the spot like the cops coming
We get back to the house like we forgot somethin'
She ain't with the end, all like a hipe homebody
Yeah, that's the shit that I like, I'm just sayin'
