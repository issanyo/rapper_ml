[Intro: IamSu!]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, god damn
Aha, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Ice chain, ice ring
Young rich nigga doing my thing
A lil' guy with big bucks
Girls love me, they can't get enough
She the type to make a young boy spend that cash
She the type to make them TMZ cameras flash
Post a picture on the 'gram, make my old girl mad
I'ma pull up in a Lamb' on you just like that
Still pulling tin up in a Hyundai
If she ask me for a stack, I be like "Huh? Bae"
Benihana entre√© Ferragamo ensemble
Young boy look like a he stepped out the explore page
Real nigga from the bay
Feel myself like Mac Dre
That's how I like it with them hunnids in my right and left
'Cause so many of, I can't think a freak I kept
Nike on my feet, I need a check for every step
You got all them squares up in your circle fucking up your rep
I put all my niggas in position like I'm playing chess
Diamonds laying on my chest, overpaid and underdressed

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Drop it down low and pick it up slow
Drop it down low and pick it up slow
Drop it down low and pick it up slow
Like round and round and round it go (It go)
Like round and round and round it go (Aha)
Like round and round and round it go (Turn up)
Like round and round and round it go
Like drop it down low and pick it up slow

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
Gold chain, cold game
Bring it back, bring it back, rogaine
Her boyfriend here, no name
She gon' do it for the boy, no shame
Do it like I prefer it
Donut in the ski skirting
All night, don't leave early
Light skin thing and she perfect
No flaws, oh god
She ride it like a pornstar
Get up in the P, I goes hard
This a classic like it's Mozart
Yeah, wobble, wobble, shake it, shake it
If I'm fucking with it, she not basic
Homies dreaded up just like Jamaicans
Thang from Oakland when she be acting many

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Drop it down low and pick it up slow
Drop it down low and pick it up slow
Drop it down low and pick it up slow
Like round and round and round it go (It go)
Like round and round and round it go (Aha)
Like round and round and round it go (Turn up)
Like round and round and round it go
Like drop it down low and pick it up slow
