[Chorus: ST Spittin]
Scared money don't make no money (no money)
A closed mouth don't get no bread (nope)
Holla at me baby when you get your dollars up
Otherwise I ain't hearing nothing you said (said)
P-P-Put your money where your mouth is
And I don't wanna hear it if it ain't about biz-ness
Put your money where your mouth is
And I don't wanna hear it if it ain't about biz

[Verse 1: ST Spittin]
Ch-ch-cheddar cheese cheddar cheese nothing better please
If [?] I've have a couple felonies
My lifestyle changed better women better tree
Same old attitude, style been ahead of me
I can't leave rap alone, game needs me
Getting [?] mostly ain't easy
Get it while the getting is good
Been a hustler we make a lot of those in my hood
Understood, hate it or love, lets talk about the budget
My time is my dime, I profit from my discussion
Like a talk show host
This talk so dope, finna get it from go
I was brought up in the O

[Chorus: ST Spittin]

[Verse 2: Kool John]
It's the rich city [?] flipper
You ain't fucking with my niggas I ain't fucking witchu
I'm screaming bitch I look good come and take a picture
I got a ugly bitch I fuck her when I'm off the liquor
You know a nigga pulling out when I'm finna bust
You know a nigga get around like a tour bus
You ain't saying shit and [?]
You know I'm about butts [?]
She all hopped up on my lap and started twerking
I told her [?] money she said I'm fucking perfect
And I got your bitch on my Instagram lurking
I got the city on my shoulder like it's crowd surfing
(Yee!)

[Chorus: ST Spittin]

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
I'm hustling I'm mobbing
Wiz took me on tour now a nigga popping
Damn I'm heart break shmoplife monster
Cuban link chains on sold out concerts
No I'm not a playstation ho you can't play me
Roll through every city like the fucking five eighty
Play in this in the hotel make her strip naked
Macking in my bloodline no I can't change it
And I got my day ones with me, hating you can miss me
Need a hundred million trying to blow past 50
A-Always on my busy, f-focused on my grizzly
Major money counting even though the boy envy
(Let's get it, Suzy)

[Chorus: ST Spittin]
