[Chorus]
I am loosing myself to find you
I am loosing myself to find you
I am loosing myself to find you
Yeah I'm dying, it's true
Never been about anything more or anything less
It's all about you
Like I'm loosing a war that I can't win
But I can't loose because I'll loose you

I'm realizing the definition of life and the line
Between truth and lies
So in the end I be lying where the truth lies
I'm a dog off the leash they want me euthanized
Told me I'm not too far away well I ain't too surprised
Looking down at the world like who the hell am I?
Chocolate thoughts it's all I'm wondering, vanilla sky
Waiting for my words to be heard, to be televised
It's the worst I'm impatient, I get the urge, go crazy
And run the game just for exercise
Fuck the fame cause all the pain that I've gained on my way here
Is been left behind
So I'ma give you what I got not what I got to give
The worst part if being alive is only not to live

[Chorus]
I am loosing myself to find you
I am loosing myself to find you
I am loosing myself to find you
Yeah I'm dying, it's true

It goes, breaking down the weed, heading to the money
Got an outta pocket speed, yes, true indeed
In the newest meeks, doing interviews
Bout how I moved about the street and how I started make beats
I mean great stone, Jordan short song, sipping christyle
Man that shit's wild
Telling pilo we gonn be good till he say the same thang
However you wanna put it, I put on a whole gang
I put hbk every song, they ain't take it serious
They say here we go, on your stereo
World spinning, it go round and round, like a merry go
Barely know, but I swear to god I'ma deal em hot as hell
I'm a criminal stacking money to the ceiling but
Feelings niggas fake, I'm past go, feeling like I'm great
Bitch I need millions on my plate like

[Chorus]
I am loosing myself to find you
I am loosing myself to find you
I am loosing myself to find you
Yeah I'm dying, it's true
It's true, it's true, it's true
