[Intro: Sidius]

OG's
Sidius nigga
Chris Weed
Ha, ha

[Verse 1: Sidius]

They be like Sid yo, can you teach us how to Dougie?
And I say no cause all you bitches ugly
Better Febreeze these tracks, my nigga my dumps be runny
Beat that pussy like a drum, call me the Energizer bunny, Ugh!

I'm so musty bitch, never trust me round these kids
Chick I don't eat pizza but I always keep a crusty prick
Streaking through Ibiza with some skeezers like we running shit
Then cheefin' on some reefer make you queef because your lungs so sick

Slapping up you Dracula fuckers rocking that Polo
Sucking us like hungry sluts going down on cocolos
If that bitch got a horse face, let her take this pony ride
But I still get a stomach ache when they play macaroni time

Bawk!, Bawk!, Sid is spitting don't ask why the blocks hot
Yawk!, Yawk!, crippled bitches be dancing that sock hop
Top notch, be this piff, lay your ass on the black top
Gotta use the big dipper to heat up this crack rock

Spitting these written synonyms, all your lyrics illiterate
Listen to the musical version of jack the ripper trick
Niggas roar like lions but really packing a kitten dick
Play your bitch like a fiddle, we made this beat on her clitoris

[Hook: Sidius]

Its throbbin', throbbin', Og Musick Mobbin'
Don't own an umbrella but we keep that Mary Poppin'
Auschwitz, Auschwitz, my mattress a box spring
So if I fuck your bitch my nigga Chris knows when to hop in

Throbbin', throbbin', Og Musick Mobbin'
Don't own an umbrella but we keep that Mary Poppin'
Auschwitz, Auschwitz, my mattress a box spring
So if I fuck your bitch my nigga Chris knows when to hop in

[Verse 2: Chris Weed]

Mobbin', mobbin', All my niggas riding
Striving to reach the top, when all my niggas are grindin'
Talk is fucking cheap, so I know half of these niggas lying
So I hit'em with the track, before shits off with some violence

Think this musics shits a game, fuck you and the referee
OGM affiliated till the fucking death of me
Tryna fuck around, I'll have you buried under depths of me
Chris Weed be the craziest, while Sidius is next to me

Nigga I'm a wild one, fuck you and go try one
Started off fresh , so pay attention when I'm done
Ain't no stopping me, I won't compete cause you admit defeat
Og Musick taking over, all you lames just take a seat

Get up, fuck off, no set up
Niggas wanna eat, gotta get a plate of cheddar
Gotta get this bread up, gotta get my creds up
But Og Musick riding through real hard, Only Cause we

[Hook: Sidius]

Throbbin', throbbin', Og Musick Mobbin'
Don't own an umbrella but we keep that Mary Poppin'
Auschwitz, Auschwitz, my mattress a box spring
So if I fuck your bitch my nigga Chris knows when to hop in

Throbbin', throbbin', Og Musick Mobbin'
Don't own an umbrella but we keep that Mary Poppin'
Auschwitz, Auschwitz, my mattress a box spring
So if I fuck your bitch my nigga Chris knows when to hop in

[Outro : Sidius and Chris Weed]

Throbbin', throbbin', Og Musick Mobbin'

Throbbin', throbbin', Og Musick Mobbin'

Throbbin', throbbin', Og Musick Mobbin'
Don't own an umbrella but we keep that Mary Poppin'
Auschwitz, Auschwitz, my mattress a box spring
So if I fuck your bitch my nigga Chris knows when to hop in

Get up, fuck off, no set up
Niggas wanna eat, gotta get a plate of cheddar

Don't own an umbrella but we keep that Mary Poppin'
Cheddar, Ch-Ch-Cheddar

Don't own an umbrella but we keep that Mary Poppin'
