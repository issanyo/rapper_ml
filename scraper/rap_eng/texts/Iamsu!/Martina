[Verse 1]
I want you to look me in my eyes
Do you see something different?
Do you see something changing in me?
Can you tell something’s missing?
I lost my mind a long time ago, people hear my style I go
Crazy like I won the race, got a few miles to go
Two goals in life stay humble, count my dough after two million
Albums sold I’m still underrated
Got snuf from the freshmen but it didn’t change my demeanor
Cause I skipped a few grades, in this game I’m a senior
Big man on campus, I just stay up and watch
These rappers make up stories, trying to change up the plots
Pop the chase on records, just for me to deflate them
I’m bulldozing you niggas, no treaty, no ultimatum!
What I’m back in the bay, they’re treating me like I made it
Can’t even walk in the am, pm, these folks going crazy
Black Martin Scorsese used to ride on that AC transit
And the way we run the game you would think that we land it
Uh, I’m whiling about and they can’t understand it
Trashing top floor suit to pay for the damage
Still living at my momma house
Looking at real estate, finna buy my mom a house
Told Martina, “get what the fuck you want!”
I’m an example how you could do what a fuck you want
Just gotta believe that shit, nigga

[Outro]
How profound
Now the hope is for you to see yourself in him
Him in you, I mean his kind
You feel gravity forcing your hand
Tonight only dream, but they’re executing
Sincerely yours
