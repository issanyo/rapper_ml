Holy Shit

Verse 1: IamSU!
Turn around, every how I burn it down
You don't know, better learn it now
Uh, heartbreakers make the world go round
My nigga Sage on the beat, break it down
Gang, gang she got boy shorts on her booty hang,hang
I take her from the club, we go orgutang
That's ape shit
Me and my niggas headed to the top
We can't quit
Bang this

[Hook ] (x2)

Go 'head get your  money don't stop
Go 'head get your  money don't stop


[Verse 2]
Uh

See my Gucci belt, when I sag mine
Finna hit the stage, only bag time
Blowing on some sour D's , it's Jeet jak time
Now my team on, haters dream on
Alway's plotting, so you know I got my scheme on
Flow tight, call me Suzy, 6 Speedo
Making money and I stack up them c notes

Chicken strips, no scraggo
Super click no Mescago
