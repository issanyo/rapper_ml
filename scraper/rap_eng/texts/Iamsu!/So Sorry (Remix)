Su!

Verse 1 (G-Up)
Straight steady puffin
I really ain’t mean nothin
Sorry that I hurt you
I ain’t mean start nothin
And you’ve moved on, I know
Put your shoes on, let’s go
Tryna put the crew on, fo sho
Not tryna put a show on, no no
I bury the hatchet, they callin you ratchet
But I know the truth girl, I’m sayin let’s patch this
I know that I did wrong, I thought I was savage
Instead I turned average, my life ain’t so lavish
Chillin with Blackbear, glad that I chose him
Pull up to Gaylawn, he actin all frozen
He actin star studded, grabbing the Mosin
He think that he winnin, he the only one losin
On some real shit though, hope you find a guy that loves you for who you are
This was all planned by the man chillin in the stars
I’m tryna say sorry and finally move past this
This is all that is stopping me from living that lavish

Chorus (G-Up & Blackbear)
Was a good life
Stayin up past midnight
Ruined your life
Toss and turnin all night
You said that you ain’t love me
I know you wanted to
I’m so sorry, K.B. of what I’ve turned into
Was a good life
Used to party all night
Till I ruined your life
Can’t sleep, all night
You said that you ain’t love me
I know you wanted to
I’m so sorry, K.B. of what I’ve turned into
Yuh

Verse 2 (Iamsu!)
Heartbreak Gang, see that you joined us
Hope you Joyner, not Lucas
Spread the word to the town, finger pointed right at us
Guessin we’re even, count the times that they add up
Y’all always be wildin
Need me an island
Need me some time in
Divorce be filin
People be crazy
Lights out like Hailey
Then they try ban me
Got cheeks like Sandy
Please let’s not fight no more
Beautiful woman, not a whore
You was my baby but I fucked it all up
Drinkin Henny, no chaser, red cup

Chorus (G-Up & Blackbear)
Was a good life
Stayin up past midnight
Ruined your life
Toss and turnin all night
You said that you ain’t love me
I know you wanted to
I’m so sorry, K.B. of what I’ve turned into
Was a good life
Used to party all night
Till I ruined your life
Can’t sleep, all night
You said that you ain’t love me
I know you wanted to
I’m so sorry, K.B. of what I’ve turned into
Yuh

Outro (Blackbear)
I know I acted shady
Threw us away like I’m Brady
But I still love you baby
G, you not alone, we all got a K.B
