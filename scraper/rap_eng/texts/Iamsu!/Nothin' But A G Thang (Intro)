Never in a million years, thought it would get this real
Use to listen to Kanye records, It would give me chills
Thinkin' 'bout the way  my life is and how it could go
As a youngin', idolising Snoop Dogg and Death Row
My cities cut throat
Ain't many I know that made
So, I had to create it
Took my do's and i paid it
Tryna walk in my shoes
Took a few steps on the pavement
Now it's chains and the whips but no slave ships
Hopin' that  rain eclipse this whole Bay shit
On my way in becoming my cities favourite
Niggas know my intentions, keep it g as hell
It's two options
Prescent to suceed or fail
And never see a jail
But I know it's hard
But, I'll be cool cause I roll with  God
I can't control the odds, but I know there in my favour
From hittin' the coins, started gettin' paper
Imma work hard than whoever before me
I make so much noise, so you will never ignore me
My circle is close knit, my buzz is enormous
As tight as a closed fist, go find me some Sheman, uh
Cause I'm the shit, flow crazy as a gisp
Progress is slow process, this is really hit or miss
So, hold your head
Little one, hold your head
Stay true to what's you
Stay humble and stack your bread up
Cause first come pride, then fall
My mama told me that
I promised nobody would hold me back
From this dream that I put my life into
People are tryna decipher Su
Well understand, that I only  do what I like to do
Besides I few or too many rappers to write the truth
Reside the booth, took it upon my self to  go inspire the youth
Only 22, got a long way to go
Knowing a nigga coming next
Would the 5 be the 4
All these labels wishing they signed me before
But, it;s too late
This gang Shit is finna blow
