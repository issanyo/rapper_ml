Young Suzy baby I am really really hot now
Soup kitchen flow everybody in my pot now
Swat ‘em like flies do it big super sized fries
All these rappers tell super sized lies
Everybody hatin’ I’ll let you decide why
Maybe because I don’t play no swings no slides
All about my money there ain’t no free rides
Flow wet like the beach where the sand meets sky
Trust me they gonna figure it out eventually
It’s all about the paper like where the point of the pencil be
Mentally I am ahead of them I’m better than all these rappers
If they sink I’m the medicine
Young ass nigga sharing thoughts with the veterans
All about fam rough forget a friend
I got two black balls for them niggas trynna black ball
I’m about the stacks y’all

I just wanna do me, I don’t think they hear me, I don’t see nobody near me
I just wanna do me, like muthafuck a hater, I’m flyer than a fuckin’ aviator
I just wanna do me, I don’t think they hear me, I don’t see nobody near me
I just wanna do me, like muthafuck a hater, I’m flyer than a fuckin’ aviator
I just wanna do me…

Back to the basics back to the days when
I was rapping for entertainment
Only confessions no Raymond first Rain man
I was told by an OG to work harder
And be a Rich City movie no Coach Carter
Uhh, young boy but I’m growin’ up
Mean swag walk with a lean like I’m pullin’ up
Been in it not just showin up
Female tendencies is all that these industries niggas showin’ us
So I stick to myself like I’m Velcro no money I tell you hell no
And the day I sell out will be the same day that hell froze…over
I’m just trying to find my place like Melrose
Yeah this music can make you lose your mind
Let success be a word that you define
I remember when have you listen when give Su the time
Want to get to the top of the mountains that’s for you to climb

I just wanna do me, I don’t think they hear me, I don’t see nobody near me
I just wanna do me, like muthafuck a hater, I’m flyer than a fuckin’ aviator
I just wanna do me, I don’t think they hear me, I don’t see nobody near me
I just wanna do me, like muthafuck a hater, I’m flyer than a fuckin’ aviator
I just wanna do me…

Momma I got my head on straight don’t let ‘em lie to you
Niggas mad cuz Suzy ain’t jumpin’ for every alley-oop
People say a lot about me half of it is prolly true
Especially when they say I don’t give a fuck about these rappers foo
Smoke to relax my mind go to school just for my mom
These teachers ain’t sayin’ shit rather be out on the grind
The boundary is so defined I don’t know y’all
Menace to society call me ol’ dog
I go hard for lack of a better term
Burn some bridges with some decisions I had to live and learn
I want it now but sometimes you got to wait your turn
But when it come to money that’s something you never wait to earn
I stay confirmed tell me if you disagree
I’m about the money ain’t no sense in beef
If you beg to differ the bigger picture is quite clear
HBK we ahead by uh lightyears

I just wanna do me, I don’t think they hear me, I don’t see nobody near me
I just wanna do me, like muthafuck a hater, I’m flyer than a fuckin’ aviator
I just wanna do me, I don’t think they hear me, I don’t see nobody near me
I just wanna do me, like muthafuck a hater, I’m flyer than a fuckin’ aviator
I just wanna do me…
