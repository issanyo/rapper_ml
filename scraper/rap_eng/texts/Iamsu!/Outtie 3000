[Verse 1]
Beautiful girls chillin
This is reality, before it was a figment
I used to dream of this, rocking all the cleanest ish
When I used to bring it up, it would quickly be dismissed
Now everybody want a piece of me
Just cuz of the music I been making recently, uh
Wasn't nobody around when I first started
They actually turned me down but that ain't what the worst part is
They barely know me in my home, home is where the heart is
So I work the hardest
Make sure my flow retarded
I'm such a different artist
I'm a dog, Calvin Broadus
They tryin' to be different I've been different for the longest
Yeah say hi to the nice guy
Matter fact say hi to the nice life
Often daydream live the night life
And we can get it in just make sure the price right

[Hook]
I be chillin', really I be chillin'
Feelin' so good, I don't think you know the feeling
And I be chillin', really I be chillin'
Feelin' so good, I don't think you know the feeling
I be Outtie 3000, Outtie 3000, Outtie 3000
I live in my zone, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Apologizing to you haters, excuse me I'm sorry
But me I'm chillin' man you rappers ain't scaring me hardly
And when it come to competition I don't see nobody
I'm dreaming of just beaming up, do you see me Scotty?
I'm a fighter, I'm a soldier
I'll never give up even when it's over
When pressure hits, most people lose they composure
I stay cool, matter fact I might get colder
You been in it for a minute but I'm Yoda
You diminish, I replenish step ya flows up
Polo linen and T denim step ya clothes up
Balloon treatment from pretty women we get blowed up
Got the key to the lock like the janitor
I spit that white girl, Lindsay Lo, Pamela
I been chillin' like Walt Disney's brain
If it ain't money then you know you could miss me, mayne
