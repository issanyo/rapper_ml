[Verse 1 – IamSu!]
I hope you ain’t scared of heights, the top it make you nervous
I look in the mirror, ask myself is she worth it
Bitch I’m way to fly to try and slither with you serpents
Lames tryna shut me down but that shit ain’t worth it
Baby so thick like she had butt surgery
Game so thick I take a nun up out that clergy
I know she want this dick, and she want it in a hurry
She want to find out if I’m lying in my verses
She want to steal away, steal the vibe so they can copy it
You so obsolete you should change your name to floppy disk
I can’t trust you rappers, I feel like you got it out for me
Enjoy my fruits of labor, bout to harvest from my money tree
Hanging with my faculty, deeper than a cavalry
You niggas smoking Reggie, that shit flaring up my allergies
My homies lost count, all the times they had to count on me
Love worth more than money, know they can’t put no amount on me till RIP
I’m shining light in the shadow of doubt [?] they know we gone kill em like [?]
Two women like I’m LL in the house, it’s two nights in the building, we selling it out
She get so wet she prevail in a drought, seven [?] I be bailing fools out
You talk that bullshit, I’m quick to tune out, she say Suzi is all that she listen to now
You just stepped in to the catalogue, this ain’t [?] but I’m a master at work
You too concerned about fashion and bitches, my family and money, it has to come first
Hand me that check, I’mma bounce on desert, ain’t nothing sweet long as we on this earth
Gracious good grief, I got [?] on [?] fuck you internet thugs hitting space and delete
She want to listen to P&D, but all I want to do is put my D in her P
Pushing my swagger so easily, they must have sandals on cause they are seeing defeat
We in the lead, swagging on E and [?], I go OD on the beat
That’s overdedicated, overdrive, highly medicated all the time
I’m so fresh I need a clothing line, in the studio it’s overtime
It’s acceleration, it ain’t no [?]
Niggas infiltrating, now they telling lies
I got better places I could spend my time
Like on an island with a bad bitch
But still hustle like I’m dead broke
But in the end I’m alive and rich
Let’s get it

[Verse 2 – T-Wayne]
Man my bitch so bad I swear to god my bitch is perfect
Pussy wetter than a mermaid mixed with a sea serpent
Fresher than detergent, cut your bitch like a surgeon
Every day I’m working, I’m like a serving servant
I be going in like a young nigga with curfew
I’m all on your bitch like a purse on some perfume
Bitch don’t get me wrong, I’m with them niggas that’ll murk you
My verses are sicker than ebola mixed with bird flu
I am with the shits, my stomach hurting all the time
I’m shitting on these rappers, need a bathroom when I rhyme
And tell that girl that I don’t want her if she ain’t a dime
If you ain’t talking dollar signs you getting left behind
And I be going hard on these rappers, and I don’t even try
I’m real with the flow, I ain’t even got to lie
You washed up ass niggas getting hung up to dry
Man I’m so fly you can find me in the sky
Got a foreign named ling and all she speak is Chinese
Man I swear to god that girl look like she’s Jackie Chan’s niece
Man in rap shit I’m a beast, every beat I touch, I feast
Don’t nobody want to work, but everybody want a piece
And that’s real
