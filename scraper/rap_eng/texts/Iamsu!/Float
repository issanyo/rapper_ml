[Intro: IamSu!]
Yeah, uh, uh

[Verse 1: IamSu! & (Ty Dolla $ign)]
Probably never told you this
But baby girl you the shit
You will be my leadin' lady
If I wrote a movie script
And I can’t, I can’t pick a word to describe her
The way it makes me feel when I look in yo eyes
When I look in yo eyes it’s like swimming pools to yo soul
And Lord knows I can’t swim so please help me float
Please help me float, please help me float
And Lord knows I can’t swim so please help me float
I said, please help me float, she said this and I quote
“I pray to God that you love me til you can’t love me no more”
I said, please help me float, she said this and I quote
“I pray to God that you love me til you can’t love me no more”
Okay, one time for my lady, one time for her man
Two times for my lady, I do everything that I can
(You got that wet wet) Make me come home early
(Oh yea yea yea) And I ain’t even scratched the surface
(Oh oh) You help me find my purpose, uh
I swear you make it worth it, uh
(Yeah) And after all the searchin', uh
I think I found the perfect one

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla, $ign
She got that wet, sea world
And I dive in that pussy like Shamu, girl
Yeah go all the way to the bottom, no scuba
Told your nigga - move bitch, get out the way like Luda
I hit her with the ruler, I know a little Kamasutra
And my bitch bad so I be glad to eat that coochie
I hit it slow, take my time, man I stroke it
Real nigga can’t swim, I’m just tryna keep on floatin
Said when I look in yo eye it’s like swimming pools to yo soul
And Lord knows I can’t swim so please help me float
I said please help me float, she said this and I quote
“Why don’t you ever try to see me no more?”
