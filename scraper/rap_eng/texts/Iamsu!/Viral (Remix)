Shake that ass like you're tyna go viral

You over there with your friend right beside you
Couldn't take my eyes off, even if I tried to
Girl, you're finer than my fine
'Cause if  I don't sell them roses in the club, I'ma buy a dozen
You could be the one, I'ma be the two though
Swag through the roof, kick game like judo
For real I see you focused on your health, yoga bar doin' sit-ups
Seven in the mornin', set alarms, finna get up
You only move when you in the mood
It's time to go viral, a million views

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Shake that ass like you tryna go viral
Move your body like you tryna go viral

Shake it fast, back it up on me
Sweep it low like you clean for me
Bend it over like you drop something
Now touch your toes like you're exercising
Shake it fast, back it up on me
Sweep it low like you clean for me
Bend it over like you drop something
Now touch your toes like you're exercising, shake some

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Shake that ass like you tryna go viral
Move your body like you tryna go viral
Wind for me like you tryna go viral
Viral, viral, viral, viral
Shake that ass like you tryna go viral
Twerk something like you tryna go viral
Bust it open like you tryna go viral
