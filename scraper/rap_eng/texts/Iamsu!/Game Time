[Verse 1]
Long live Lil Tunechi
I’m young with money
Baby I’m the shit but I don’t see no flies on me
She gon’ fly to me
For little or no money
Yeah I’m 25 but I go 18 dummy
Yeah the flow mean but it’s hard to act friendly
Walk into the building and it turn into a frenzy
Real life mack, I don’t take that girl to Wendy’s
Then give her this dick, yo, while you keep it Disney
And I’m like yee!, that’s what we say
Shawty thick like she came from the peach state
And my squad, HBK
She gon’ scream for me like she won the sweepstakes
It’s no love for the fake, high five for my real niggas
You know I’m a high rise to you lil niggas
Ill wish me, like some hot fries and a dill pickle
Got to watch out for them demons ‘cause they will get you

[Hook]
Let me get ‘em, let me get ‘em (I got em)
Let me get ‘em, let me get ‘em (I got em)
Let me get ‘em, let me get ‘em (I got em)
Let me get ‘em, let me get ‘em
It’s game time
Woah, (I got em)
It’s game time
Woah, (I got em)
It’s game time
Woah, (I got em)
It’s game time
Woah, (I got em)
It’s game time

[Verse 2]
Six speed, I’m a driver
El presidente, Suzy Obama
Why you acting like a thug when you not one?
Why you say you got guns, never popped one
See me I’m tryna get money and chill
I got ‘em fronting the bill, they know it’s real
Put my MAC down
I’m from the Bay, and they love me for real
They know my movement is trill
And they respect the boy’s lifestyle
When I bring the ice out you can cut the lights out
Lil mama so bad put her on timeout
I’m a boss, that’s the real definition
Need the top spot, not the second position
I’m a beast in the studio, cut the mic on
And I be in this bitch going all night long
We in the Bay, going dumb in the town
Hit the stage, all the bad girls running me down
Rather wait while you drown, better learn how to swim
Don’t try to ball with us if you ain’t put up shots in the gym
Only rocking with tens, keep a bad one with me
One foot on the gas, what’s on the dash, 150

[Hook]
Let me get ‘em, let me get ‘em (I got em)
Let me get ‘em, let me get ‘em (I got em)
Let me get ‘em, let me get ‘em (I got em)
Let me get ‘em, let me get ‘em
It’s game time
Woah, (I got em)
It’s game time
Woah, (I got em)
It’s game time
Woah, (I got em)
It’s game time
Woah, (I got em)
It’s game time

[Outro]
Uh, woah woah
HBK, they know how we play
Hey, hey, and I can’t quit
All I know is all I know is
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Let’s get it
Yeah, it’s game time
