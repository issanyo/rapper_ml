[Hook-Iamsu!] x4
On Mamas, uh

On Citas, On Mamas
Niggas talk but they don't want problems

[Verse 1-Keak da Sneak]
Your life past 'fore your ass even touched the grass
211 in progress, no ski mask
Assholes to Elbows, lay down and kiss Satan
Thats a weakness nigga hatin
I'm out here motivatin
On bitas, Citas, thats my word
So jump back off the porch, pop back on the curb
Breakin down some herb
Gettin ready for the twistback
4 or 5 grams need a titan just to twist that
Niggas talk but they don't want none of that
On Citas from the top got right back
Droppin back in the pocket bout to hit sum
And no frontin', let me tell you bullshits nothin'
Puttin' hoes in the war room
My moves mean team militant, it's straight goon
Head bluntin' puttin' hoes in the war room
My moves mean team militant its straight goon

[Hook]

[Verse 2-Iamsu!]
Hella proper
Hella chopper
Thats hella fly, tell the doctor
Im the man, thats how I ride around like
I'm the whole thing, you a sound bite
Got the city on, whole bay too
Hella bad ones fallin outta H2
Get money then they hate you
Turn around, say they made you
Well hate this then
We some young niggas ballin like Pistons
Gettin love ain't no where a nigga can't go
Ten racks same show im getting Pesos
Like woop, woop, thats cookin
Paid 200 for the mookies
Hear a beat take a dukie
And the all black whip lookin spooky

[Hook]

[Verse 3-Mistah F.A.B.]
They don't want problems
They don't want problems
Actin like they gangsta, but they don't want drama
Boy they be quiet, when you pull that llama
Put that on my Citas, and my grandmamas
Return of the skitzo
Maniac, flip so
That boy go yeye
He party like a disco
And diss go, go, go, gone
They been waitin for the boy Fabby just to bring it home
So them niggas been tryna turn up, but they was doin it wrong
I was off for a minute but im right back on
Yeah right back on
Yup on in the middle of it
I don't give a finger in the middle of it
Nigga yellin fuck em, fuck em
They was hatin on me
But shoutout to the real niggas waitin on me
Don't gotta bring it back cause it ain't never left
It's Suzy on the track nigga rare yup
