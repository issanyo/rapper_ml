[Hook: IamSu!]
I am higher than a plane
Ba da dum dum dum
Since they put me in the game
Ba da dum dum dum
Hot Boy in the building
I set the house on fire
I got bands to the ceiling
Watch me dum dum dum

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
All the lights on me
It's a good thing I got your sights on me
You look nice, Mami
I got book a room and get a flight money
And ain't nobody ever right for me
I hit the booth and then it come to me
I'm from the Bay that's where they go dumb
I am about my business, I am no dummy
She don't want a man
Heard her ex-boyfriend, wished you want a man
I got plans laid on top of plans
All my homies stackin' change, call it common sense
One show, that's a year rent
I know all you new niggas as my children
Been ready ever since the diligence
Cause I stick to the script and read the fine print

[Hook: IamSu!]
I am higher than a plane
Ba da dum dum dum
Since they put me in the game
Ba da dum dum dum
Hot Boy in the building
I set the house on fire
I got bands to the ceiling
Watch me dum dum dum

[Verse 2: AKAFrank]
I got everything I need
Jameson, bad hoes, good weed
I'm the truth and [?]
10 hoes all [?]
45, yeah I came back ballin'
On to the next, but my ex still callin'
Hot Boy Juvie, tell him I need 100 grand
Write that ass up, tell him how I feel, understand
Niggas always talkin' who the hottest, you are novice
They tell me I'm the future and they bein' honest
Go on tour just to show niggas
I've been ready since the  Go Getters
I'm from the place where they out of sight, ghostride
And you know we keep work , more TIE
The music make the money, call it seanotes
That's your bitch, I'll take her back
Ain't we cool

[Hook 2x: IamSu!]
I am higher than a plane
Ba da dum dum dum
Since they put me in the game
Ba da dum dum dum
Hot Boy in the building
I set the house on fire
I got bands to the ceiling
Watch me dum dum dum
