[Chorus: Problem]
Aye, aye bitch, try this

[Verse 1: E-40]
We out here trying to function, bitch (BIATCH~!)
You're fucking off my high, get up out my mix
You're messing up my vibe, I'm trying to get some crevice
Put her in my ride, take her to the Ritz
I'm toasted and sloppy, I fuck wit broccoli Bacardi,
Bacardi one fifty one out my body, about that green like wasabi
Like Young Bari we mobby', we bossin', back the fuck off me
Getting money my hobby, not getting money is not me
Only rappers I listen to is E-40 and Pac
I'm having my revenue playa having this gwop
I'm on my fly big nigga shit man I stay laced and groomed
I spray myself with sucka repellent my nigga, not perfume
Anything you got I can sell it, a hustler think I can't
Gift of gab, sell the White House black paint
Word Candy, S.L.A.N.G
I'm thinkin bout takin a million dollar insurance policy out on my mouthpiece (BIATCH!)

[Verse 2: IamSU!]
(Right, yeah, haha, yeah) Aye bitch, okay bitch
It's uncle Earl and the HBK bitch
Mention the gang they already know that we ballin
I'm coming straight out the Rich, I got family down in New Orleans
Where you from, you say you're lying out here
We say that you jawsin
You probably thought this never would happen
My niggas been called that
Alcoholic, sippin on that liquor, oh I'm drunk as hell
Fuckin' with a lil bitch over in Vallejo
Got a whole pack of pre-rolled Young L's
And I'm never down to uno, pockets on sumo
Haters respect the pedigree, ballin heavily
A phony homie, I never be for methamphetamine
That means it's crack ho, young G, hotter than Tabasco
I smash hoes, collect two hunnid and pass GO
My flow so Lamborghini, yo shit's so Rav 4
Now you understand why everything I do I gas ho
Suzy, nigga

[Verse 3: YG]
I’m out here trying to function, out here trying to function
Don’t talk to me bitch if we ain’t fuckin'
Yea I’m a asshole, I don’t give a fuck though
Skip the bullshit, like wussup with some suck though
I go too much, make you bitch choose up
Niggas getting mad nigga what you gon' do
If he think he too tough, you know I keep two tucked
If I don’t fight that mean I’m comin' back to shoot
Ridin' in the car, lookin' for a bad bitch
With an ass and tits, yeah she gotta be dumb cute
Got her number text her phone like “baby what you doin'"
She was like "Nothing much you should come through"
I got dick for days, I got dick for days
Made her take off her work and gave her dick for days
Push it to my brain, to my temple bitch
And I don’t like these hoes, I give ‘em dick and dip, whoop

[Chorus: Problem]
Aye, aye bitch, try this
Guarantee turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin, I'm just saying man
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
We out here trying to function, man we out here trying to function
