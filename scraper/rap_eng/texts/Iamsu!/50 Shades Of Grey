This for all you niggas
Thinkin' I'm too scared to respond
To these angry ass niggas throwin' stones at a don
I mean, honestly, it's like bubble bath to a pond
Gram polkin' every shirt, Hordio and Quran
They all wanna know my take on it
I ain't got one, ask around
Real niggas know
They seem to settle where the metal is
Fuckin' between, then the rules on both sides
Papered on limousine, what?
Tint darker than killas dreams
Heavenly motifs, the devil stay tryna intervene
Fuck it! Be higher than Levine
Then call my bitch up, lit like a light bulb
But won't neva eva switch up
Industry nigga calling my phone I rarely pick up
Cuz all they talk about is what new rapper they sick of
Then 3 months later I'm checking music on Fader
And its him and the same rapperâ€™s new record titled won't switch up (go figure)
I won't feel 'em with yo hands
It's a fact I'm on these tracks just doin' wheelies with no hands
Niggas like to ask me like wassup with me and Wiz
It was what it was, now it is what it is
Me, Prez and Nick, no bags, meetin' up at the clear port
Rumor has it me and Meek Mill fought at the airport
Won't go in detail cause that ain't how I conrole
But respect was the air result and at least he got down, tho
That's more than I can say about a lotta these niggas
These iFights I'm gettin' tired of, niggas
Where the love? Fuck the subs! It's the hood
Where we at, YG? We both responsible fo' bringin' this shit back, YG
Fuck the money, fuck the crew, we need to chat, YG
Both our first time on TV was together
Remember that, YG? Ball's in yo court
Either duck it or pass
Buckets of blood or buckets of cash
Ready either way, it's enough of that
Snapbacks, no bucket hats
No more free verses, where yo muthafuckin' budget at?
I'd done put way too many niggas on fo' free
That get deals off my buzz and get mad when I want my fee
Homeboy, I could tell ya I neva hustled befo'
Ya supposed to respect the connect, so the hustle keep gon'
Fo' the connect disconnect everything you got going
Shit, I can't blame you fo' not knowing
Should just say that then
The rap game would let a lay back in
Finally forgave us fo' that shit that went down way back when
It's about progression, we too rich for all this agression
Bottles of bad bitches, now I feel the section
Oh yeah, no tough shit, I ain't tryna be thug
This ain't a mask on, cause deep down...
