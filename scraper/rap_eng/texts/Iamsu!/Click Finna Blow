Hi
Hi
Hi

[Hook]
I'm riding, I'm rolling
Stay grinding, stay focused
Make money, you know this
We chosen
The click finna blow up (oh woohoo) (X2)
The click finna blow up

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
And you can ask anybody that know me
Seldom you see me without the homies
In this world it's so cold and phoney
So many hangers all holdin' on me
But shake that, dust off, bring it right back
We the team, we the dream, we got it down back
Mistakes, slipped up, trusted the wrong cats
Stay low, stay down and never change that
Made it out, stayed real, and then I came back
Same pack, same crew, your boy stayed true
(Tryna see what this world came too, fantasies and my dreams come true)
Young dude tryna make a way
Hustle to make a dollar and hopes of a better day
Straight up out the Bay
The same place as the Federey
But I'm not defined by the music may where I stay
Suzy!

[Hook]


[Verse 2: ? ]
Uuh
Young rich motherfucker uh!
HBK Gang, who do it like we does?
Tryna get a million where we just..
Countin' money, chillin' with my feet up
Hoes go crazy, get wet when they meet us
Show me where the green is, shootin' like arenas
Heart Break Gang been shutting down arenas
Baby got a mean one
Show me what that shit do
Keep it all on a bitch like pimple

[Verse 3: ? ]
You either hate me or love me, world make up your mind
Fast cash but I take my time
Dime bitch maybe a 9
Tell her what she wanna hear, & it maybe a lie
See back top back when she come through
Smokin' & blowin' weed out the Sunroof
Gazing at the stars
They raisin' & they applaud, when they witness what ?? do

I'm riding, I'm rolling
Stay grinding, stay focused

[Verse 4: ? ]

Gettin' money
Without a major
See the style
She love the flavor
I quench her thirst
I gatorade her
Never cuff it
Always keep it player
Already know I'm a fool with it
Bout to get the gang & my crew with me
Bout to ?? on the industry
HBK till the end of me
(let's get it)
