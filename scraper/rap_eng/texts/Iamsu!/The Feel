[Hook]
Can you tell me what it feels like?
When you got the whole game on your shoulders
I'mma tell you what it feels like
Think there's some young niggas takin' over
I just wanna smoke somethin', roll somethin', up for me
I just wanna smoke somethin', roll somethin', up for me

[Verse 1]
Runnin' on a campaign
Cause I gotta get it, ain't no handouts
I can never ever be a lame
If you gettin' real cheese, pull the band out
I'm right back in the game, diamond in the chain
Heartbreak Sudi mane, HBK the gang
My whole team winnin', but I keep spendin'
Showin' off my pretty women one time I'm gonna kill it
I'ma hundred rack boy, right now I need  millions
So I'm always on the grind tryin' to get it

[Hook]
Can you tell me what it feels like?
When you got the whole game on your shoulders
I'mma tell you what it feels like
Think there's some young niggas takin' over
I just wanna smoke somethin', roll somethin', up for me
I just wanna smoke somethin', roll somethin', up for me

[Verse 2]
When I think about the game, I see a bunch of bitch niggas, and some fakers
I don't really think that it could use a change, I'm switchin' up the paint job, call it mango
You know we come to play, if I do it I get paid
We do shit a different way, same shit a different day
Mind on my business and god is my only witness
So tired of the lies you really just got to let it
Shine on you niggas, I'ma ride for my niggas
I'ma grind all the time just to get it cause

[Hook]
Can you tell me what it feels like?
When you got the whole game on your shoulders
I'mma tell you what it feels like
Think there's some young niggas takin' over
I just wanna smoke somethin', roll somethin', up for me
I just wanna smoke somethin', roll somethin', up for me
Can you tell me what it feels like?
When you got the whole game on your shoulders
I'mma tell you what it feels like
Think there's some young niggas takin' over
I just wanna smoke somethin', roll somethin', up for me
I just wanna smoke somethin', roll somethin', up for me
