[Intro: IamSu!]
HBK, yeah you know how we play
And I can't quit, woah, woah

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Runnin' up a check, I gotta get my bands up
Thousand dollar belt, that's just to keep my pants up
We gon' hit 'em with it 'til they understand us
All we know is money, we don't understand much
I've been in the game, I paid my dues
When I'm in my bag, I cannot lose

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Get it where you started, dawg, that's where you end up
I got in position and I brought my friends up
2017, my mama need that Benz truck
If you need a feature, I'ma need like 10 plus
I remember days when I ain't have 10 bucks
Women by the twos on me like Timbuk
Thousand dollar shoes on me, I be dripped up (swag)
Mojo make 'em choose on me with no pimp cup
I be doin' shows, girl I be havin' goals, forreal
I did it on my own, while other people chose a deal
Sittin' on my throne, I feel it in my soul forreal
My grill got diamonds, make me chill
No mistake why I'm here, tell my driver take me there, yeah

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Runnin' up a check, I gotta get my bands up
Thousand dollar belt, that's just to keep my pants up
We gon' hit 'em with it 'til they understand us
All we know is money, we don't understand much
I've been in the game, I paid my dues
When I'm in my bag, I cannot lose

[Verse 2: 24hrs]
Twenty you be gone, you be on the road now
Heard you did a song with G, finna blow now
Born in the city so it's all love now
Suzy kept it real from the day that we met
Day one niggas, smoke weed on the jet
Shawty from the Valley likes to use me for the sex
In the Vivian white skirt
And she can get the blunt if the head good
"Twenty you got me in my feelings, uh huh"
Hit it from the back 'til she screamin'
First class, shawty on the way to Vegas
Mom called my phone, said, "Twenty made it"
Uh huh, I can buy her everything I want

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Runnin' up a check, I gotta get my bands up
Thousand dollar belt, that's just to keep my pants up
We gon' hit 'em with it 'til they understand us
All we know is money, we don't understand much
I've been in the game, I paid my dues
When I'm in my bag, I cannot lose
