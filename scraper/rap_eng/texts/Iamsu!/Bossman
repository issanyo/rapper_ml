[Verse 1: Berner]
Bitch, go and get your ends up
Kush smoke, flowing out the benz truck
Two shows, I'ma need ten plus
Come through suck me and my friends up
Money, light blue pills and a bunny
The Bombay gin got me dancing all funny
Pull me in the back and let me play with your mouth
I'm in the lap dance booth and I ain't breading her out
I get ratchet, leave town overnight of baggage
I'm blowing on cookie, way out in Kansas
Ask around town boy I really get down
Shit I smoke by the pound, boy I keep me some loud
I with them HBK boys P-Lo and Su
Yeah I'm good with pack plus I'm sweet in the booth
I got a mouthpiece chill make a freak bitch choose
Cartier frames with the LV suit

[Hook: P-Lo]
I be rolling through the city I be riding
Big bad benz bad bitches on the side
I get that dough, bitch you know my neck stay froze
I'm out here getting these O's, aye
I'ma boss man, never care whats it's costing
Touching green like boston
I'm a motherfucking boss man, boss man boss man

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
All I got left is a dollar bill
Guess I'm back to the ATM
Ugh, pull out the max
Go back to the club, take her back pull out some tracks
We make club security nervous
I show up with so many real niggas and they ain't searching
Ten bitches in a suburban
They ask me why I loving so many I say I deserve it
Reporting live from the trap, all partners in the whip with a board on my lap
Whole city on my back
Get this shit like kitty litter niggas don't know how to act, uhh
Young Suzy the Don Gato, when I slide through everybody wanna holla
Don't call unless its money
From the home of the hyphy but I ain't nothing near a dummy
Suzy

[Verse 3: P-Lo]
Young P-Lo yeah I ride around
Pretty bitches big money on my side of town
Balling at the gym while you outta bounds
Rolling through the hood you don't hear a sound
I'm a young motherfucker and I'm faded
Couple mixed bitches getting naked go crazy
You ain't talking money I don't hear that shit
Unless you throw the pussy at me I'ma kill that shit
All the Gangster, Pimps, Players, Hustlers
Balling at the club make bitches wanna touch us
You already know I'm a fucking boss
I's stayed dotted, T's forever crossed
Bitches wanna get involved, we don't talk in bed at all
I'ma boss man ho I set it off
Getting money like a sedative
Fucking with the gang ho your better off

[Hook]
