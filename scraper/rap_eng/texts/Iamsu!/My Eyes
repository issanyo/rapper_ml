[Intro: Mozzy]
Yeah...blood say he my brother, never rock for me
I'm out on bail bangin' corners wit' this hot .40
Blood say he my brother, never rock for me
I'm out on bail bangin' corners wit' this hot .40

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
The opp is soggy, niggas chopped it up wit' Fox 40
I can get your flowers watered for a bronze rolly
Cookin' wit' ya gloves on is what my pops showed me
Couple stones don't concern me shit, ya mom's owe me
DA dropped it, picked it back up and filed on me
I thought you was my bitch, why you dial on me?
Paroled from the pen, BM had a child on me
I was broke, y'all was up gang, lookin' down on me
Momma and them countin' on me
Dooders and them countin' on me
Hood need artillery, shooters and them countin' on me
Love you for that day you hid them caders in yo' house for me
I just left the H they had the slum and the loud for me
Oooohhhhhh

[Chorus: Iamsu!]
I thought yo' momma told you don't play wit' them boys
Honestly, you gave me no choice
See the target I aim for destroy
You see the pain that's in my eyes
You see the pain that's in my eyes
If it's danger I'm gon' ride
If it's danger I'm gon' ride
You see this pain that's in my eyes

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
It's Pebble Beach and on my daughter I'd die about it
Cut him off, that nigga stole somethin' then lied about it
Child of danger, man I'm smokin' gettin' high around him
Pray I catch you huggin' the corner, finna slide around it
Hundred band challenge, this a whole lot of guap
Manslaughter for that body Uzzi Azi caught
It's manslaughter for that body Uzzi Azi caught
Four twelfth, Ready Rob, free 'em off the top
And Jigga bitch you know I love you foo' you all I got
Ali bitch, you know I love you foo' you all I got
Six twelve, fuck a bitch, fuck you nigga's thot
We all brothers odd it out and let them niggas box
Hus Lotto took a trip in every Benz he cop
He had .40, I had chop, bitch I swear to God
He had .40, I had chop, bitch swear to God
Pulled up on nigga's blocks and had to air it out

[Chorus: Iamsu!]
I thought yo' momma told you don't play wit' them boys
Honestly, you gave me no choice
See the target I aim for destroy
You see the pain that's in my eyes
You see the pain that's in my eyes
If it's danger I'm gon' ride
If it's danger I'm gon' ride
You see this pain that's in my eyes
