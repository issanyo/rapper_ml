[Verse 1: Kool John]
Making hits and counting money every day that's nothing
Made more money on my merch than [?]
And my flow is sugar happy nigga I keep on bussin
Standing up on top of couches talking shit with my cousin
I know what you need, I know what you want
The young baller slide through put it in her stomach
Man my favorite [?]
Is every fucking [?]
Every day is payday I'm calculating daily
I wanna fuck an R&B bitch in a new Mercedes
Grew up in the Riches boy you know them niggas shady
I remember when a nigga didn't have a damn thing
Now the owners of the club sending over champagne
Now now now now I'm that top line top nigga
Said you want this work, it's a long line my nigga
Everywhere I go I hear Kool John that nigga
Bad bitches and pop tags and pop that champizzle

[Hook: Kool John] x2
Getting money I be stunting nigga aye that's nothing
Rolling dro blowing O's nigga aye that's nothing
Getting dough doing shows nigga aye that's nothing
Kept my mama out the hood nigga ain't that something

[Verse 2: Dave Steezy]
And you know I smoke heavy
I could kill these niggas in my sleep like Freddie
Yeah, and I make it seem easy
OG big polo like 2006 Yeezy
[?] Detroit players
Real cozy
Yeah I be smoking weed by the OZ
And you can ask the homie or anybody that know me
[?] isn't accepted we winning if you ain't notice
Getting loaded, still maintaining my focus
You niggas is really bogus
Nigga we the coldest
No [?]
It's hoes calling
Yeah I got so much shit up in my closet
It ain't even funny
But I'm still laughing
I hit the weed 2 times and I then pass it
Living lavish cameras flashing man this shit's a movie
Ashing on my nudies
Can't no other nigga do me

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Gimme gimme gimme
Give me that funk that
Make a nigga wanna wanna bring the wop back
I'm on top like a top hat
I really wanna bring the Shmops back
I really wanna get you off that
And on this
I'm Steph Curry girl I won't miss
I'm balling like I had a bonus
Haters tryna clone us
But they can't duplicate steez
I'm in the whip [?]
I'm on my own in my own league
Authentic to these phonies
Always buying what I don't need
And that's more style
OGs tell me calm down
I'm a dog like a bloodhound
Back back bad back gimme 50 feet
I can't fuck with you cuz I don't feel your energy
Look around the game I see a bunch of mini-me's
Ice cold balling like I'm playing in the winter league

[Hook] x2
