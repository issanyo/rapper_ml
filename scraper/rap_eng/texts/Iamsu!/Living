[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Good head get your rent paid
Then I cut a corner like a switch blade
Bitch made nigga talking shit 'bout me
Got a red car so I bought a red bottom
Chillin' at the game sitting courtside
You looking at the flyest nigga on the boat ride
Low life, I'm a multi nigga fo' life
Oh my, had it up to here like a bow tie
Cut it out, sold drugs out my momma's house
So for mothers' day, I bought my mom a house
Chillin' in the club standing on the couch
Nigga, fuck yo couch, nigga, nigga, fuck yo' couch!
Shoes cost more than that shit anyway
Any day, when the semi spray, bet it penetrate
Brrraaatt, better duck, nigga!
Got a lake in my yard filled with dope, nigga!

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I'm just livin' baby, and you got that right
I'm just livin' baby, I'mma enjoy this night
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Motherfuck the other side, (motherfuck the other side)
Motherfuck the other side, (motherfuck the other side)
Everything official, my pistol's dismissin' missiles
As far as running game, my nigga, I need a whistle
My nigga, I need your sister, oops, I don't think that came out
Still fuck a girl with my chain out
Still do my thing with my thing out
Long ass clip, I could shoot you without aiming
My life, your motherfuckin' entertainment
Dangerous, leave you with the angels
Shoot yo' ass from all types of angles, explain this
Well, it was just bunch of niggas and then just me
They came close and it just skeet
They tried to run and I said "Come back"
If you think you're alone then there Bobby Womack
Hold that, ridin' that Phantom down Old Nat
Nigga said "What up, pimp? Where the hoes at?"

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I'm just livin' baby, and you got that right
I'm just livin' baby, I'mma enjoy this night
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Ride around on my side of town
You might fuck around and get peeled
I rock Mookee, rock Y3, got Bathing Apes on my heels
Nigga, this ain't no game, there ain't no competition
I knew he was a fake, got good intuition
23 and I'm still livin'
Been all around the world and it's still Richmond
Cause I'm loyal to my soil, good to my hood like oil
Got me in that water, bet it boil
Bitch, I'm a boy, beat the beat up like Roy
Consider your bitch my employ', real to the core
Straight up, I never been fraud, and I put that on my lord
Y'all rap 'bout clothes that you cannot afford
Where's the Versace and where's the Tom Ford?
Everything we rap 'bout, that shit be ours
This bitch a freak, she should get the award, aye

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I'm just livin' baby, and you got that right
I'm just livin' baby, I'mma enjoy this night
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'
