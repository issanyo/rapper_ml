Six speed, skinny jeans, big cheese. Trick please, we are OG’s. No need , for the hate, I blow weed everyday, medicate. Let me think. Do I hit the dank, or do I hit the bank? Give me fetti, give me money, give me cash. Give me mouth, give me pussy, give me that kitty-kitty kissy-kissy. Let me smash. Let me puff, let me pass, let me ash. I rep the gang every chance that I get to. You look good in Vera Wang girl it fit you. Moneys not a issue. Blow it like tissue.Niggas say they baller, but they jersey’s not official. Referee blow the whistle. She got my dick hard than a missle. Ooh

Uh I don’t smoke, but all my bitches do. Get high and go low that’s what she funna do. Put my uh in a rubber like a inner tube. Then I meet her in the middle like a interlude. Uh she blow grams to the slow jams. Hippie program, Bob Marley with the ganja, blowing on Jaimaica. She only smoke papers. She fucking with a gangsta, a rudebwoy, a taka.  Buyaka buyaka that’s the sound of my cannon. More fiyah! More fiyah! We cause damage. Top shotta, don dada, ill nana, pussy killa, pussy killa, there’s none hotta. Big poppa, heart stoppa, the jaw droppa. Big choppa fuck with us you know nada. But me no really want no problem. If you do then my gun will ting a ling like Shabba
