[Hook 2x]
Aye, that's a bad bitch, yeah yeah
Aye, that's a bad bitch, yeah yeah
Aye, that's a bad bitch, yeah yeah
And I'ma walk over there and let her know

[Verse 1]
I don't mean nothin' personal
But I wanna make you the first to know
HBK gang in this ho
All about bread, 'bout business, ho
Hell yeah, drop it down for a young nigga
Where your girls at? Tell 'em come with you
All I wanna do is have fun with you
Get it one time, and I'm done with you
Hell yeah, and they said they makin' big bread
Big green, nigga I been touchin' racks since I was sixteen
It's the real deal, on the big screen
You ain't talkin' 'bout money you can miss me
She drop it down to the ground when she hit the club
Make a nigga go crazy when she pick it up
I told her it's a green light, it's a go
I tap my bro on the shoulder and let him know

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
Girl do that shit
Like you lookin' in the mirror
She said she like girls
Let's find another girl to share her
I'ma pull up, real quick on that thang
I could set my iPhone 6 on that thang
Yeah, you know the money ain't an issue
You gon' pick up everytime a nigga hit you
Only fuckin' with her if she been official
If she play let her go, it's always dough up on her mental
Her man trippin' but no, he don't want a problem
All I give a chick is dick and bottle water
She wanna smoke up all my weed, ho sayonara
I'ma free her, keep it g, I'll have a badder bitch tomorrow
It's the real deal, on the big screen
She wanna be in videos, she got big dreams
I told her it's a green light, it's a go
I tap my bro on the shoulder and let him know

[Hook 5x]

And I'ma walk over there and let her know
And I'ma walk over there and let her know

[Hook 2x]
