[Hook 2x: Iamsu]
I can't fuck with broke hoes
No, no, no, no, no
But if that head right I be there every night
In the game so you know I gotta play right

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Real bad bitches got they own cheese
Give her that thang then she won't leave
She with me, better ends up
She with me, she a 10 plus
The first night I got her on her knees
She with you, man, she just wanna leave
I'm ballin' like I'm playin' on a team
She want me cause I'm always on a scene
Got no time if you broke
My ex always hatin' on the low
Only blow loud when I smoke
She know I go deep when I stroke
(Aye) She gave me that A1 no steak
Want it right now I can't wait
You act like you real, but you fake
You broke, but you want me to chase

[Hook 2x: Iamsu]
I can't fuck with broke hoes
No, no, no, no, no
But if that head right I be there every night
In the game so you know I gotta play right

[Verse 2: Kool John]
I can't fuck with these broke bitches, man, they need a fixin'
I can't mix with these broke niggas cause my grind is different
I don't let 'em get too close, you know I keep a distance
And she want me cause I'm ballin' like Spalding and Wilson
You ain't sayin' I'm the hottest, you gotta be kiddin'
I'm always listen' to myself, go with my intuition
And these broke hoes that I'm dissin', that's my own decision
Cause a nigga gettin' money like college tuition
Fuck what a broke nigga gotta say
If you ain't gettin' money then we can't relate
Two gold chains, they light up like a microwave
And she let me get the pussy with no title (hey!)
Smokin' on some shit, it's called danger
I be in and out, I'd probably fuck a loose stranger
She let me hit that's a banger
See a broke bitch, I'm throwin' up the middle finger

[Hook 2x: Iamsu]
I can't fuck with broke hoes
No, no, no, no, no
But if that head right I be there every night
In the game so you know I gotta play right
