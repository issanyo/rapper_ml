Yeah, yeah yeah
Uh, yeah
Aye, aye
Yeah, yeah, aye

[Hook: IamSu!]
Time and time again they told me, I would never win
Told myself go grind and get it, they won’t say that again
No stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
I had to play my position to get me where I’m at
I’m coming straight out of Richmond I put it on the map
I promise beating statistics is not an easy task
Remember back when the dealer just trying to get it back
I was 22 [?] got it back the next week
That’s the true definition of why I’m Suzy 6-speed
It’s a goal, writing rapper 16’s on the low
Keep it lit, plugged here from the V to the Mo
It’s my dream just to ride a Lamborghini through Pinole
Eating plenty lobster, steak, and fettuccine for my woes, whoa
Tell ‘em back back
Hated on me, watch me get the last laugh
Running through the game without a fast track
Multiply my digits, exponential, that’s math
I woke up and got straight to it
I can’t tune in to their movement

[Hook: IamSu!]
Time and time again they told me, I would never win
Told myself go grind and get it, they won’t say that again
No stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Yeah yeah

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I-80, see me switching lanes, yeah
Rich City where I got my game, yeah
Hilltop is where I bought my chain, yeah
I thought that I would never bling, yeah
Momma say I look like Kenny Wayne
Calafia hook me up every time that Christmas came, yeah
I remember when the functions used to go
Shots start firing, we had to hit the floor
Lost so many people to the game
But so high we over came
But you always on my brain
That’s why I’m always in my lane
Cuz I sacrifice to much to see my momma cry again
That’s over with, HBK Gang who I’m rolling with
I promise you that we the real ones to go against
Copyright all of my swag if you stole this shit

[Hook: IamSu!]
Time and time again they told me, I would never win
Told myself go grind and get it, they won’t say that again
No stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Stop signs, no
Yeah yeah
