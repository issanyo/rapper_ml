(Verse 1: Iamsu!)
Broke niggas makin no cash
Tell a hater write this on his notepad
I’m that nigga makin mo cash
Yall some fake niggas straight up out of low cash
Going Nutso On You Gustos
Hold it down one time for my cutthroats
Only time fully shine homie
Raised in the rich, rep the clique, hold it down homie
Spend the check on checks like wrong answers
Hit alleys, throw a check at the young dancing
Love hint, love sex on romancing
Haters in the club they gon throw tantrums
If you ain’t throwin money play the background
I run this rap shit sack, time to back down
And my old way, don’t know how to act now
Hell breakers on the real, reppin that now
Hah

(Hook: Iamsu!)
Kilt this bitch, it’s a homicide
Press that button, Glock to my right
Youngin getting money on this side
Make you broke niggas wanna flip sides
‘Cause I hold it down, hold it down ah
‘Cause I hold it down, hold it down ah
‘Cause I hold it down, hold it down ah
‘Cause I hold it down, hold it down ah

(Verse 2: Kool John)
Yea yea yea yea yea
Rich city nigga hold it down now
Marathon flood, run the town now
Every round made me shut me down, down
You niggas not the humbles, you some clowns
Hunned extra K, run this rap shit hah
I’m a smart nigga, now the others nigga hah
Tryna suck my dick off this rap shit, hah
Made a coupla backs off this rap shit hah
Now pick the check like ini mini mo
From the bay but it’s really rich city though
Niggas blow big, you got the itty bit of drug
He’s lookin the nigga, got the money, save yo flow
Ain’t got a single but the number ain’t whack
From the riches but they bumpin nigga arab
Get some head in the car then I drive out
And I spend it a drug with a dry mouth, I’m out

(Hook: Iamsu!)
Kilt this beat, it’s a homicide
Press that button, Glock to my right
Youngin getting money on this side
Make you broke niggas wanna flip sides
‘Cause I hold it down, hold it down ah
‘Cause I hold it down, hold it down ah
‘Cause I hold it down, hold it down ah
‘Cause I hold it down, hold it down ah

(Verse 3: Skipper)
I been getting money since way back
They hated on me well I guess this is the payback
Hardtop stang but I push it like a Maybach
Beat bang hard, it’ll leave a nigga face flat
Diddy bop on the track, nigga take that
Billionaire boy and I’m asking where the BAPE at?
Heartbreak Gang, fucked around and brought the bay back
Ain’t nowhere to hide
Ain’t nowhere a nigga safe at
I’m the type of nigga that get straight to the dough
When you’ll hear this in the club, take that shit to the floor
Every time I give it to em they be wantin some more
I be higher than a bitch, I get that shit for the low
Ain’t another nigga get it how I’m getting it bro
And I never gave a fuck about a bitch or a hoe
And I got my niggas with me and they ready to ride
I’m a young wavy nigga never change with the tide
Skipper!
