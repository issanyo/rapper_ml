[Verse: YMTK]
Another all nighter on the fresh coast now
Windows tinted but they best rolled down
Mary Jane make her stress go down
Jackie Dan maker her dress go down
I been gettin money on the West Coast now
Just a young nigga from the East Oak-Town
Used to be a hooper, hung with Mr. Cooper
Backstage with Hammer, baby let me screw her
No GMO in my screwers
All you niggas is talkers, we doers
All my niggas is winners, y'all..
Fill in the blank
Shakers & movers who made the maneuvers
My moma made Murphy, Murphy makes movies
& I'm playing with the cheat code now
Run it likes I'm Beastmode now
Zach put me on the track & never seen my feet slow down

[Hook: YMTK]
I'm up late in LA
No bedtime in the Bay
Sleepless in Seattle
Wide awake in San Diego
No Rest on the West Coast
No Rest on the West Coast
Roll that, pop that, pour that, Let's Go
No Rest on the West Coast

I'm up late in LA
No bedtime in the Bay
Sleepless in Seattle
Wide awake in San Diego
No Rest on the West Coast
No Rest on the West Coast
Roll that, pop that, pour that, Let's Go
No Rest on the West Coast

[Verse: Iamsu!]
Palm trees, mixed breeds, swisher sweets full of big trees
People flying from all over the world just to see Six Speed
No rest on the West Coast
Up all night yeah
On the road to LA
Couldn't find a flight yeah
Money on my mind yeah
Can't nobody stop me
Touched down at 5am no time to site see

Twist it up just to medicate
In a better space
Goin for it never hesitate get the record straight, yeah
Aye

[Hook: YMTK]

[Bridge: YMTK]
I don't have no sleeping habits
I'm so insomniac
I'm on the let's go grab it
We up all night like addicts
No signs of slowing down it's only signs of sun up
Gotta grind & get the funds up
No time for naps & no time for lunch
Pray when we wake then we bake a bunch
Make a couple tracks
Make a girl choose up, bless up Hallelujah
I be dressed up on the regular
Acai & Turkey Burgers
Blind Barber with the flirty workers
Studio at 4am,
Daylight come & we do it again..

[Hook: YMTK]
