[Hook: Omar Kadir]
Now climb that pole... uh, uh, uh, uhh
And wind down slow (w-w-wind down slow)
You Y-You You right there (right there)
You look so good, but you act so bad
Y-You right there (right there)
(Just be who you were, get you all over here)

[Verse 1: Omar Kadir]
Girl can I help find you (you)
I can unwind you (you)
I can help fine tune you, into the girl I l-love
Girl can I help find you (you)
I can unwind you (you)
I can help fine tune you, into the girl I know
Slow (slow) down
Let me see your show
But how you let that thing go (go)
If ya down show me what you love

[Hook]
Climb that pole... uh, uh, uh, uhh
And wind down slow (w-w-wind down slow)
Now climb that pole... uh, uh, uh, uhh
And wind down slow (w-w-wind down slow)
You Y-You You right there (right there)
You look so good, but you act so bad (why you tryna be so bad?)
Y-You right there (right there)
(Just be who you were, get you all over here)

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I want Y-O-U
Your boyfriend is a lame
You know we not quite cool
And I'm the ice in the cup
I'll be lightin' 'em up
If being bad was a crime then I'll be writing you up
Then trowing you in the clinker
I'm a hell of a thinker, I'm a hell of a smoker
And a bit of a drinker
I'm a beast, I'm a creature
The most not the least of
On the grind like crazy show my ass on my features, ayy
Let my take you on a Heartbreak holiday
Low key, maybe just a hideaway
Boss like Hugo, fly as ever you know
Killing these rappers but not attending their funeral
She's dressed like a Goddess
I guess God was her stylist
Young and getting money, now we're wildin'
Turn it up a notch then...

[Hook]
Climb that pole... uh, uh, uh, uhh
And wind down slow (w-w-wind down slow)
Now climb that pole (climb that, climb that)
And wind down slow (w-w-wind down slow)
You Y-You You right there (right there)
You look so good, but you act so bad (why you tryna be so bad?)
Y-You right there (right there)
(Just be who you were, get you all over here)

[Bridge: Omar Kadir]
But she be killin' every short casin'
She be killin' like gors face I know, I know, I know, I know
But she forgetting all the old always
She be killin' like gors face I know, I know, I know, I know

[Outro: IamSu!]
Uh, so exotic, o-out of control body
You only live once, make the most out' it
So I stack bread making toast out' it
That's why when we in the club we get the most bottles, ay, ay
