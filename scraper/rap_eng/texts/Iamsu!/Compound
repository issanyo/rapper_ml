[Intro]
IamSu! the label
HBK the gang
Hot New Hip Hop
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Mad rich alert
Swag with the verse, 6 B's
She thought I was just an average at first
Baby make it work for a new t-shirt
Sat it on my lap, I might just throw you in the air
Trust me girl I did it if I said it in a rap
I never get it out the clinic, get my weed up out the trap
Everything I'm saying it's authentic, it's a fact
Ain't no limit how we gettin' it, Percy Miller taught me that
Yo the new fans say they miss the old me
Think I came this far to get some cold feet?
I'm well off, well taught by the OG's
He get it for the high, I'd rather get it low-key, not me
School of hard knocks, play the game by the rules
Ain't too many people who can do the things I do
Pay attention dude like my women by the crews
If you want a verse from Su it's 5k times two

[Hook]
I've been locked down at the compound
Mama on my nerves, told me calm down
I've been on my wave for a long time
In the kitchen tryna get my songs right
Baby make it work for a new t-shirt
Sat it on my lap, I might just throw you in the air
Imma catch feelings if you do it like that
Stack it to the ceilin' but it grew it right back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Imma catch feelings if you do it like that
Stack it to the ceilin' but it grew it right back

[Verse 2]
Step out your position lil baby imma cut you from the team
I've been on my Diddy doing Biggie so I guess it's all a dream
These youngin's out here trippin' on prescriptions mixing molly with the lean
But me, I got a vision, I ain't slippin' so I gotta keep it clean
Roll the red carpet, bring the cameras every time I'm on the scene
And the flow bananas cause you know I keep gorillas on the team
You know you could look in my eyes and see I'm not tellin' no lies
You think you could fuck with the guy? You washed up, you wastin' your time

[Hook]
I've been locked down at the compound
Mama on my nerves, told me calm down
I've been on my wave for a long time
In the kitchen tryna get my songs right
Baby make it work for a new t-shirt
Sat it on my lap, I might just throw you in the air
Imma just catch feelings if you do it like that
Stack it to the ceilin' but it grew it right back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Imma just catch feelings if you do it like that
Stack it to the ceilin' but it grew it right back
