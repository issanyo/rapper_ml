[Hook]
I just jumped off the mother-lovin' porch and got straight to it
Like a lion in a cage, Imma break through it
I got my guys with me
Come spend some time with me
You'll recognize a G
I enterprise and B-U-I-L-D with my baby, let's get it popping

[Verse 1]
Back at it, man its been awhile
Touch hunnids, I get aroused
Woke up with an idea
Think too fast, can't write it down
Check her gram when she out of town
Making sure she never out of bounds
Niggas be plotting to take her
Counting the days till we break up
Money hungry need a raise up
I will never take a pay cut
Argue, fight, then we make up
Then I'm fucking up her makeup
Bought to go and get my cake up
I been balling like a Laker
Bought to go an swoop the wraith
Up
Keep it silent never changed up
Keep my head down and my change up
We was played down so we played us
A weaker man would've gave up
But my momma ain't raised no hoe, my nigga
She showed me how to do it independent, I codependent
My first calls a ticket
I ain't got no time to kick it
Stack my dough up, mind my business
They distant from hating niggas, yeah
I'm in my castle with my queen and shit
I always say the meanest shit
The gang is who you see me wit'

[Verse 2]
But they was trying to take the way from me
One from [?] I tell him VPS my chain, homie
Stacking chips and game running
Hardly with the same woman
How can you describe it if you ain't really came from it
I be on some fly shit, while you be making play music
One foot on the gas through my city switching lanes through it
Bitch don't kill my vibe, I got so much on my mind
Here to [?] and come alive
Chunk my deuce up when I ride
I won't hold up
They trying to take the sauce when I spill it
I won't slow up
I'm 'bout to hit the game with precision
And you know what
You rapper gotta make a decision
A couple stacks just to visit
I'm young and black plus I'm gifted
You out of touch with the movement
I'll tap you back in the system
I'm dynamite, 'bout to blow up
I'm out of sight, fix your vision
I put the bay on my shoulders
I did this shit just for Richmond
I raise the stakes like it's A1
They have a way so I'm A-1
