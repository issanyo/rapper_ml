[Verse 1]
I put everything in perspective like what's real, what's fake?
I do that when I sleep, forget about it all when I wake
On a mission to be great, tryna figure out what it takes
All the places that we been, all the money that we make
I built it from the ground up
Realness's the only thing that surrounds us
The labels came searching and they found us
Underground kings now it's time to crown us
Kool John called it all a couple years ago
He had a vision and I made it musical
A lot of people talk about it, it's a few to know
How to make a dream on reality, it's beautiful

[Hook]
Look mama I made it
Look daddy I made it
Look mama I made it
And can't nobody take it
Look mama I made it

[Verse 2]
Steady progressin'
My mama screamin' "any profession" but this
But this is it, like Michael Jack. Whenever I write a rap
I feel like I'm flying, but there's no kite attached
Niggas be overzealous, impatient, not understanding
That it's a marathon, we ain't racin', they get complacent
Cool with just being that nigga on the block
A fool is one that cools down when they hot
That's the prototype for those in my cypher
So I promise I'mma be nothing like them
Gentle as a dove, but I'm wise as a viper
A style that recycles, repacking is just trifling
It's time that we struck like lightning
More invigorated, more exciting
More deliberate, more delighting
Bring it to the table, cause it's priceless

[Hook]

[Outro]
Have you ever had a dream you believed in?
Tell me, have you ever had a dream you believed in?
And one day, achieved it
Tell me, have you ever had a dream you believed in?
Tell me, have you ever had a dream you believed in?
And one day, achieved it
