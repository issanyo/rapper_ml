[Intro]
Mally Mall!

[Hook: Mally Mall + (2 Chainz)]
We gettin' bread by the stacks
Blow a mil, make it back (truuuu)
Pretty boy Floyd with the bag (money)
Where you from? Where you at?
We gettin' bread by the stacks
Blow a mil, make it back (truuuu)
Pretty boy Floyd with the bag (money)
Where you from? Where you at?

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Rock star, Pink Floyd every night
Get the Floyd money, nigga every night
24k gold on me every night
Blow European toy money every night (skrt)
Blow a mil and I make it back
Catch me in the drop top, ceilin' back
Niggas throw shots, know we hit 'em back
At the top where we sittin' at
Me and Mall back to back Wraith
Tell your bitch we got no space
Wavy like a sail boat
Fight night right by the rope
You wanna freestyle? I'm tryna stay free
Shots of Rose for the AP
Watch rocked up, gon' climb on it
Blew 100 then I blew another 5 on it

[Hook: Mally Mall + (2 Chainz)]
We gettin' bread by the stacks
Blow a mil, make it back (truuuu)
Pretty boy Floyd with the bag (money)
Where you from? Where you at?
We gettin' bread by the stacks
Blow a mil, make it back (truuuu)
Pretty boy Floyd with the bag (money)
Where you from? Where you at?

[Verse 2: IAmSu!]
A heartbreaking gangster
Paid for mobster
I promise to never take her for steak and lobster
Baby I'm a player, gotta take precaution
I take dates with options on a flight to Boston
And every flight first class
Hit JR, get a front pass
And at the top it's just us now
Mally plugged me on the Rollie, it's a bust down (clean)
In the Ritz like anywhere I touch down
Hoes used to diss us and they tryna fuck now
She in love with the high, not the come down
Party out in Vegas, let me take you to the compound
My life is a movie and I do my own stunts now
It's flood Uzi and every bar is like (?)
And the smoke got my eyes on kung-pao
Did it for the Bay, got the world goin' dumb now

[Hook: Mally Mall + (2 Chainz)]
We gettin' bread by the stacks
Blow a mil, make it back (truuuu)
Pretty boy Floyd with the bag (money)
Where you from? Where you at?
We gettin' bread by the stacks
Blow a mil, make it back (truuuu)
Pretty boy Floyd with the bag (money)
Where you from? Where you at?
