[IamSu!]
Indebted, I am forever indebted
Ran out of cash up in Magic
I'm asking if she take debit
I take vacations I never take credit
Cause probably somebody done already said it
My flow is sick I think I need a medic
My flow a brick tell a junkie inhale it
Gave her that Rocky you can call it Van Halen
Hailing from Richmond where people raise hell in
I'm trying to find a way like I am Magellan
They telling then hide away trying to reveal it
You got a problem sit down and Email it
To mother-fuck-you-and-your-crew at Gmail
In the position to change the whole world
Probably some people that pray that we fail
Oh, oh

[Outro]
I love my gang
Wherever I go my homies come to
I love my squad
We up in this thang like what that shit do
I love my squad, I love my squad
I love my squad, I love my squad
Huh
