[Hook: IamSu!]
I make the city look good, I'm supposed to
My bitch look good, how she supposed to
And I don't really dance, I just post up
Gang with me nigga, everybody know us
Henny in my cup, I'm getting activated
Pull up to the party, girl, I'm glad you made it
Open up the top, it's getting hot outside
Ya da da da da da da

[Post-Chorus: IamSu!]
I make the city look good, I'm supposed to (how I'm supposed to)
My bitch look good, how she supposed to (how she supposed to)
And I don't really dance, I just post up
Gang with me nigga, everybody know us (gang)

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
When I bounce out, I'mma leave my shit running
Tell the DJ play my whole song, don't cut it
Whole pointers 'round my neck, VS1 flooded (bling)
Hopped off the Everyday Struggle, Joe Budden
I hopped in my everyday bag, don't worry
20k a night for 60 days, that's money
Niggas want the lifestyle, but they can't fund it
10 times 10, I'mma keep it one hunnid

[Hook: IamSu!]
I make the city look good, I'm supposed to
My bitch look good, how she supposed to
And I don't really dance, I just post up
Gang with me nigga, everybody know us
Henny in my cup, I'm getting activated
Pull up to the party, girl, I'm glad you made it
Open up the top, it's getting hot outside
Ya da da da da da da

[Verse 2: HBK Skipper]
Yeah, alright, look

Look into my eyes, you can see how I'm coming (see how I'm coming)
Get the money, call and finna run her mouth for it (she gon' run her mouth for it)
In the fast lane rap game, Jeff Gordon
Let 'em throw shade, you can tell I don't worry (tell I don't worry)
Made her upgrade 'cause her ex style corny (ex style corny)
She just wanna go out, let her shake somethin' (let her shake somethin')
Just touched down, got another play coming (yeah)
Got a little baby, she do anything for me (what else)
From the bottom to the top, she a real road runner (what else)
Flow too hot, finna be a cold summer (hot)
So cold nigga, I'm a stone cold stunner (burr)
How I'm pulling up

[Hook: IamSu!]
I make the city look good, I'm supposed to
My bitch look good, how she supposed to
And I don't really dance, I just post up
Gang with me nigga, everybody know us
Henny in my cup, I'm getting activated
Pull up to the party, girl, I'm glad you made it
Open up the top, it's getting hot outside
Ya da da da da da da
