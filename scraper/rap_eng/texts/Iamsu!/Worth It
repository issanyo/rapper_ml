[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Ordinary Monday
Lunch with Alicia
That's when I seen ya
Posted up, pluggin' your parking meter
Matte black Beamer
Really hope you're no rapper or a singer
I ain't one to talk, but these industry dudes only want one thing, yeah
Said "You ain't gon' believe I've been single for so long"
It's true, been married to this money, boy it's hard to steer me wrong, no no

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tinashe]
And it's gonna be hard to convince me
That you ain't like the ones who have dissed me
But if I was your girl, we'd be perfect
I'ma take a chance and let you be my man
â€˜Cause, baby

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You're worth it, you're worth it (ooh)
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, baby
You're worth it (bae), you're worth it
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, worth it, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Tinashe]
We the best we the best, we the best
We the best in the west (yeah, we the best)
We the best we the best, we the best
We the best in the west

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Three years later, getting comfy and you're treating me bad
We don't even share morning showers on the weekends
Used to battle it out, NBA 2K
Now we fight every day, we fight every day
Look back in my mind, I'm like "Let him go"
Then you half-smile, I'm a sucker for dimples
No, I ain't got the time for the stressin' in my life
Been married to this money, boy you only live one time

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tinashe]
And it's gonna be hard to convince me
That you could really do what you promised me
If you make a change, we'd be perfect
So I'ma take the chance and let you be my man
'Cause, baby

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You're worth it, you're worth it (ooh)
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, baby
You're worth it (bae), you're worth it
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, worth it, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Tinashe]
We the best we the best, we the best
We the best in the west
We the best we the best, we the best
We the best in the west

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Slide on the side of you, make some time for you
Ride for you, grind for you, I'd be lying to you
We the best in the text to your ex
Say it's done, I'm the one, he a mess
When we sex, make me cum, bite my neck
Back seat, couch, bed; triple threat
Windows down, I'm playing this
All I can make is hits, I can't miss
Come and kick it with me, we can shop downtown
Plus it's 4 Seasons suites when we lay it down
Shit, I just might let you meet my friends
You play around, but it's me in the end
'Cause you know

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You're worth it, you're worth it (ooh)
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, baby
You're worth it (bae), you're worth it
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, baby
You make it all worth it, worth it, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Tinashe]
We the best we the best, we the best
We the best in the west (yeah, we the best)
We the best we the best, we the best
We the best in the west
