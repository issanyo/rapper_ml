[Chorus]
I moved on from the pain, I moved on
I moved on from the pain, I moved on
So I'ma grind from the dusk 'til dawn
So I can buy anything I want
I moved on from the pain, I moved on

[Verse]
Ayy, what you know about me? ('Bout me)
All I want is love and loyalty (Loyalty)
Where were you when it was all on me? (All on me)
When you was down, you would call on me (Call on me)
You better watch out who you call friends
'Cause I ain't fallin' for that bullshit again (Hell no)
In my ends, hittin' corners in a Benz (Skrrt, skrrt)
Smoke a joint, kick back, reminisce
I can't vouch for the way these niggas raised (Niggas raised)
Grown men still got bitch ways (Got bitch ways)
Thought we had a plan, why'd you go and switch lanes? (Switch lanes)
Showin' fake love, it's an act for stage (Yeah)
I'm a changed man, baby, I'm a baller (I'm a baller)
If you my girlfriend, you know I'ma spoil ya
Hit the gas in the Porsche, see the spoiler
Young boss, I'ma do what I wanna

[Chorus]
I moved on from the pain, I moved on
I moved on from the pain, I moved on
So I'ma grind from the dusk 'til dawn
So I can buy anything I want
I moved on from the pain, I moved on

[Bridge]
I moved on
I moved on

[Chorus]
I moved on from the pain, I moved on
I moved on from the pain, I moved on
So I'ma grind from the dusk 'til dawn
So I can buy anything I want
I moved on from the pain, I moved on
