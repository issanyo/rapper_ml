You know what it is if you heard Su
I am big money like a Super Bowl commercial
You couldn't see it clearer if I drew it in a sketch
The way she throw it back, it's like we playing catch
I got the streets talkin' like my homie D-Nasty
Girls love me, they wanna do me nasty
Triple X flow, everything is so graphic
Making money, flippin' like freaks in gymnastics
I am the future, nothing like you used ta
To get on my level you need a ladder and a booster
From a beast and creature, really nice to meet ya
Smash off on em, like hasta la vista
Rap terminator, she says the term is hater
They told me I would never make it but know I never gave up
I always held it down, the track I melt it down
They ain't know about me then, but yeah they know me now
HBK gang bang like it's Su-Wu
Eat rappers like Chao-ming cause they noodles
Money stretch like Yao Ming, I'm in ...
Like a baby in some pampers, I am on my own doodoo
Compare me to none, I'm not the best, I'm the one
Who quit till I'm done? Pardon? Smack em in the front
Cause these rappers behind, I'm ahead of the curve
Yeah I came from the Rich, but I live in the 'burbs
Got a soul full of anger so please leave me alone
Hoes know I'm a dawg, but they don't throw me the bone
I just throw em the bone, Kelly Jones my cologne
You can't kill my vibe,be cause I live in the zone
Hail Mary I'm scary, I will to no fairies
I make these rappers look so unnecessary
I'm me just new and improved
Handle my biz as cold as it gets, I do what I do
Rappers quick with the tongue, real slow with the trigger
Live they life through a rhyme, with a cup full of liquir
But I keep em 1-thuo-e, swag on Maui
The way ya boy do it got these haters like "How he?"
