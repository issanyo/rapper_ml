[Intro]
(HBK, yea you know how we play)
(And I can't quit all I know is gang gang)
(Clothes Shows and Afros and they be screaming for the kid everywhere we go)

[Verse 1]
On my way to a show, that means that I'm on my way to some O's
And some commas, thats a promise
Its quality I control
On the roll with the honor roll
Straight A flow , 4.0 we on the goal
Make every move calculated and precise
Make a list, check it twice
Making sure every step is right
Fresh out of class, straight to the Airport
They ain't got no money what I care for?
Charging my cell phone in the apple store
Bourgie girls get tossed like apple cores
Get with the program Bro-ham, or get lost
Cause the gang is engaged for lift off
Out of the Bay
Hater get out our way
H-B-to the K
Niggas know how we play
I'm focused on a mission you drink and smoke everyday
I tell them pay attention, and watch me I'll lead the way
(Suzy)

[Hook x2]
Clothes Shows and Afros
And they be screaming for the kid everywhere we go
So don't ever get it twisted HBK we really live it
Everything I got I give it (uhh)

[Verse 2]
Been repping that Heart Break Gang
You niggas just know knowing the meaning
And I'm staying loyal won't nothing come in between us
Bumping that Diplomat so that know that I really mean it
Went from showing up late to class to being on TV
But i'm chilling, keep it real every time that you see me
Very dedicated, hardly any free time
Cause free time leads to a decline
You see that bad one over there? yea she mine
She fine, and she got her own
Talking bout her alone I could write a song
And she sticking with the kid, right or wrong
But anyway, back to grind
I'm on the move
No sleep, you losing precious snooze
So I conclude
There ain't nobody on our level
One foot in they ass, the other foot on the pedal
Watch me gas on em

[Hook]x2

[Outro]
(x2)
Clothes Shows and Afros
And they be screaming for the kid everywhere we go
So don't ever get it twisted HBK we really live it
Everything I got I give it (uhh)
