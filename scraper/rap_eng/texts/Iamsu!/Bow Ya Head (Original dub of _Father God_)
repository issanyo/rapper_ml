[Intro]
Yea
True story
Real life
Uh
Bout this life
Bout this life

Uh
Yea, yea

[Verse 1]
I'm not a king, bitch I'm a pharaoh
Real busy nigga from my apparel
I told my homies let me lead the way
I pray to God I see another day
I'm 23 and ball like 23
In every other month I make like 10 at least
Spanish mamacitas, tell her ven aqui
Spend this my receipts, tell it fell deep
Recent line at least with my dinner sweet
Fuck a thousand dollars I spend that on sneaks
Fuck a thousand dollars I spend that on jeans
These niggas never felt no hunger pain
I used to steal food to fill my dinner plate
Where I'm from people dyin every day
Doin what they can, they try to make a way
Where I'm from people dyin every day
Doin what they can, they try to make a way

[Hook]
Bout this life
Bout this life
Now let us pray
Uh
Now let us pray
Uh uh
Said bout here life
Let us pray
Father God, let us see another day
Now bout this life
Let us pray
Father God, let us see another day

[Verse 2]
I could go a whole lifetime without yo co-sign, uh
Cuz I write dope lines
Doper than coke lines
I've been here for the whole time
I ain't never had no time to sit
So homie, it's go time
And I can't make no promises
Cause it's all about the almighty dollar
Comin' from the land of the lost and forgotten
Drake told niggas that he started from the bottom
But you dig a little deeper, and it's prolly where you'll find us
Find us in the middle of the city steady grindin
Came up from the bottom of the bottom tryna come up
Young king, I don't want my head cut off
People like Frany when the brake let off
Placin my vote that I never turned as you know
Touch a black op pop some adderall, lateral
Pass the success to my homies I never thought twice it was truly a matter of fact
Stackin them racks, hoppin off stages across the globe
Learning bout things only God should know
Steadily stackin my broccoli though, watch me though

[Bridge]
Ape shit on these niggas
Too dumb all these hoes
Stackin up my bills
Countin all this dough
And its HBK forever, better get that through your skull
I'mma eat until I'm full, I'm shinin on you, never dull it, aye

[Hook]
Bout here really
Bout here really
Now let us pray
Now let us pray
Bout here really
Bout here really
Let us pray, let us pray
Father God, let me see another day
Bout here really
Bout here really
Let us pray, let us pray
Father God, let me see another day

[Outro]
Have mercy on my soul
But really I'll turn up
Have mercy on my soul
