[Verse 1: $moovie Baby]
I'm that nigga with the tattoos on me
From a city where the cash rules only young
Creole nigga like my Baton Rouge homies need a
Thick bitch who can act a fool on me
Young baby get it popping like some hot grease
I rebound Dennis Rodman when I drop cheese bitch I ball
Ain't gotta tell you how I cop these
I'm just a young fly nigga talking mach three drop heat
Loyalty is all nigga know
Call It what you want
Work hard make a lot of dough put my niggas on
Put my city on too
Fairfield California tried to warn you don't be hanging on them
Corners trying to
Corner the market like a businessman
Shit!
It all started in a mini van
I'm with my heartbreak nigga and we breaking hoes hearts
You a bitch made nigga walking around with broke parts

[Chorus: $moovie Baby]
Nigga HOW U LUV THAT

Missing Balenciagas and skinny's like I'm will.i.am

Sturdy under pressure no I can't crack straight facts

Big timers coming from a small hood nigga
