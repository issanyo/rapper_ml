[Hook: Jay Ant]
Man, I ain't even gonna stunt
But I could show you how
I could show you how
If you don't know then you know now
If you don't know then you know now
I ain't even gonna stunt
But I could show you how
I could show you how
If you don't know then you know now
If you don't know then you know now

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
In a perfect world we would all be rich
Hating on me I'll dissolve your clique
Two tone Rolex on my wrist
In a battlefield I'm a soldier, trick
Life is what you make it I made mine a movie
Baseline abuser, singer rapper producer
Gold Jesus and Gold Pharaohs
When from 18th to Melrose, fall off hell no
I be checking stripping in the finest places
But I got cash like I'm buying these places
Uh, I turn 23 and turn 23
Burn plenty trees by any means homie
Buy skinny jeans keep a lot green on me
Like I'm mister green jeans since I was a teen homie
So ima ball until I fall, spend it all in the mall
Hit it once never call, you know what I'm talking about
(Aye!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
All I do is stunt, bitch, you know I'm a boss
I'm popping off tags, I don't care what it cost
I'm riding with my seat back, shines on, I need that
I'm pimping and I mean that, hey ho
A nigga came up from the bottom, mane
Diamonds on my AP and my chain
Looking like street lights, you niggas trying to eat right
I know you trying to eat right (right, right)
We get it popping from pop bottles, pop shit, we popping pistols
Shortie popping that ass like she know she gonna get to
Pop, that thing girl
Make a nigga wanna trick make it rain [?] twerk, work
Get it all baby, drive them all crazy
Have a ball, we'll fuck it up at the mall later
Later on we'll get in what we in then
What's on tonight's agenda tomorrow we won't remember

[Hook]
