[Hook]
Real one, real one, you're searching for a real one
Someone to hold you down
And make you feel somethin'
Your searching for a real one
And I'mma keep it real with you

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Move in slow motion like juvie said
Lil baby half latin half nubian
Your old man hating, trying to do me in
Out with the old, let the new begin
Baby slow wind it if you don't mind it
You a cold piece and I could change your climate
Won't let me hit it on the first date
But then I'm in the bed riding like an earthquake
Make the boy want it in the worst way possible
She jumped on it like an obstacle
Don't talk every day, cause it's optional
She know she the only option, though

[Hook]
Real one, real one, you're searching for a real one
Someone to hold you down
And make you feel some
Your searching for a real one
And I'mma keep it real with you
And I'mma keep it real with you
And I'mma keep it real

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
I swear you treat me like a step-child
Like you gon' leave me up for adoption
Always searching for the next one
Trying to keep all of your options
But I'm the best you've ever known
I'll show you things ain't nobody's ever shown you, baby
I'm not gon' tell you what you want to hear, no
Cause there's too many people all over you, baby
Don't let that IG fuck with your vision
You got somebody in your presence that could make up the difference
My goals list gets checked off a lot
Looking for a real one, well X marks the spot

[Hook]
Real one, you're searching for a real one
Someone to hold you down
And make you feel some
Your searching for a real one
And I'mma keep it real with you
And I'mma keep it real with you
And I'mma keep it real

[Verse 3: Rexx Life Raj]
I don't know why you let these guys take you out of your mode
But I just want you to realize, that it's not that shit I'm on
I would tell you you're the baddest, I swear you already know You should come mess with a real one
And we could roll, up

[Hook]
Real one, you're searching for a real one
Someone to hold you down
And make you feel some
Your searching for a real one
And I'mma keep it real with you
And I'mma keep it real with you
And I'mma keep it real
