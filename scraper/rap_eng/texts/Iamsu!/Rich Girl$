[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Shortie got a ass like a back of clothes
Light skin, long hair and she tatted though
Throw a few stacks I ain't mad at all
You know I'm finna get it popping like an adderall
You already know my name, HBK ho you know my gang
Fucking bad bitches yeah that been my thing
Shortie fell in love when she seen my chains
Walk in the club, ho choosing up
Broke ho's be mad, they cannot fuck
Girl I need bucks, I like it rough
Bitches ain't shit, I cannot trust
I only like rich girls honey
Real to the core you can't take nothing from me
Couple light skin couple white skinned bunnies
Take them to the crib put it in they tummy

[Hook]
I like rich girls, I like rich girls
I like rich girls, I like rich girls
I like rich girls, I like rich girls
I like rich girls, I like rich girls
I like rich girls, I like rich girls
I like rich girls, I like rich girls
I like rich girls, I like rich girls
I like rich girls, I like rich girls

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I like rich girls
Suzy where you from, I'm from the rich girl
All about my business like I'm H&R Block
Can I get a witness man the game we don't stop
I make a phone call you popped, I make a phone call you hot
You make the decision
I throw up the W cause all my homies winning
Got my gold chain swinging
All about my papers like my name was Usher Raymond
No need to explain it
Sports and entertainment I be balling
Pull up in that coupe I tell her fall in, uh
Love racks, tell me where the cash at
Got a pink toe with a tail like a lab rat (Aye)
Look a hater in the face like what you mad at
Pull out a hundred dollar bill and let her have that
And call it youngin' Freddy Kruger how I stab that
And I ain't dropping shortie off she gotta cab back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool John]
Shmop boy getting money just from rapping now
Not fucking niggas bitches it just happened now
Yeah I'm funny though, but I been the serious though
Steady rhymes keep the ladies really curious though
Look into my eyes tell me what you see
Swagged out shmop boy rich city
You know I'm down if she willing to let me
You know I want to hit that thing if you go ahead and let me
Grab the glove like Payton
Why you wanna keep me waiting I already did the caking
Young nigga getting it quaking
Ladies go wild when they hear me talking
She said she loved my style and kush that I'm sparking
And I'm getting geared out they asking for my size now
Freaks heard about my dick they want it right now
Shmop beanie pulled down to my eye brows
Never ever cuffed up never ever tied down

[Hook]
