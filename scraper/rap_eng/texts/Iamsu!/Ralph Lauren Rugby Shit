[IamSu!]
Making improvement, when niggas thankful you losing
My people came from the South, they used to get changed with them newsters
Hanging from branches it's so ironic we don't know our roots
Focussed on the future I forget about youth
I play the back when I go out because the spotlight makes you crazy
Sometimes I sit and think about Pac's Life, it's amazing
It was taken at twenty-five, with greatness in his eyes
That's three years away I'm so thankful that I'm alive
This system is a bitch so I can't do nine-to-fives
But luckily I get paid of the music that I supply

This that Ralph Lauren rugby shit
Why you rappers getting signed off of lucky shit?
Get a guest spot, and hit the jackpot
I'ma tonka truck to you matchbox
Play the cards I was dealt, never folded my hand
Stood behind what I felt, that's what molded a man
That's what crafted a king, in a class of my own
Took a shot of success ended up blasting my dome
Bitches tripping cause a nigga don't has to respond
I just focussed tryna take my own chance at the throne

I think a lot of y'all look at me wrong
Compare me to one-hits and these quiters, next week and he's gone
Tell your favourite rappers to rethink what they feature me on
Compare me to one-hits and quiters, next week and he's gone
I probably end up on the "Where Are They Now?"-show
Cause I stood up for all the shit I was down fo'
Surround yo'-self with people who don't just say yes
People who don't kiss yo ass, people who just want the best
For you and alone, when I don't hung around the wrong
Wasn't gave opportunities they wonder where they got the song from

I'm honest, I'm sorry I'm honest
I don't wanna hurt nobody, I'm sorry, I promise
In a room full of hoes it's so hard to be concious
Lil' homie just stick to your dreams and accomplish

This is history in the making
This shouldn't be mistaken for stupidity we facing
In our generation of music, you miss me on vacation
But now I'm back to abusing and fixing back and placing
I catch a case of domestic violence, they saying
That Hip-Hop is my vision I just laughed in they face and
Had to race to get this slaughtermen
Fuck that world 'till it's loose cause I gotta win
Sometimes I chase that Mary-Jane like I'm Spiderman
Man, what kind of man get dollers and combine it with a grind?
Without getting time and sticking with a nine-to-five
But they ain't balling, stood right up here with his ring
And shout out to the real, who would kill, turn a nightmare to a dream
And I'm right here on the scene, they liking what they seeing
Bitches over there, they most likely with the team
Heartbreaker, cardshaker, Su vibes breaking them speakers
Touchdown nigga, now they wanna leak us
Take a puff of that lavender mix it with some sangria
Digested flow fuck around and hurt your pancreas
Them niggas judge our book by the cover, they can't read us
I'm doing this from A to Z bro, I stampede ya

Money, fame, success; man, it's all the same
Causing pain and stress so don't you call my name
Unless you gain an information for Harlem fame
I only came for music, not for cars and chains
It's cars for change in the game cause y'all remain to say the same shit
And when I finish I bet I'm on the same side of that chained fence
With the same click that I came with
That's HBK gang, shit

And my intentions is to get a lot of mentions on Twitter
From niggas and bitches and with em I be killing
I won't be killing but doing it harder than those who not breathing
I'm number one, not two, to Pac even
I got reason, I do it for a purpose
If I don't feel like I'm the best my time's worthless
Burn this track to hell nigga, you would think I'm atheist
When really I am blessed, it's just that I'm churchless
Working day and night shifts, open up the curtains stay alike this
Sittin' on top of green, real light shit
High being head, lights bright
If the bread right I'll be there at night
I'm in the like air like mics
Yikes

And heaven's my destination
Schedule a reservation and tell the Devil I'm waiting
Leave residue, and never do I hesitate
Nigga, time is money and I'm never late
That shit is not acceptable, you niggas analyse everybody except for you
When really you should analyse everybody, especially you
And they tell me I got a style remaining
It's not the top but I'm not complaining
