[Intro]
Yeah, ayy
HBK yeah you know how we play
Ayy, ayy, 6 speed, 6 speed, hey

[Hook 1]
Uh
They don't want you
They just want Su!
In the mailbox, hope the check came through
Like my text blue, like my checks new
If you ain't real then we don't respect you

[Verse 1]
Hear the new deal feeling like the next dude
Step out just to kill and my partner fresh too
I'm the boss man, who they write the check to
Top floor suite 'cause I need the best view
Love the way it feel when I'm riding down the strip
We got Broadway feeling like the Vegas strip
On some player shit when I made this shit
New Versace frames
You know I paid the grip
In the restaurant they look like "Who's plate is this?"
Five hundred dollar bills but I still won't pay the tip
The busboy was rude and I ain't in the mood
'Cause he ain't understand that he was dealing with the dude

[Hook 2]
Nah, they don't want you
They just want Su!
They want Mr. Always-see-me-stunt-with-something-new

[Verse 2]
Hop out extra clean, they respect the team
We got LIV Miami feeling like the Mezzanine
Hope I win a Grammy in my life, that's the dream
Accepting my award in my new embellish jeans
I be riding low in every whip, I hella lean
If it ain't the money, buddy what you telling me?
I be counting green, call it celery
Hope nobody trip, 'cause we hella deep
New designer kicks, being all this shit
Name somebody fresh as me, he do not exist
We do Bennihana's at the bar don't need to show
Order extra rices and I like this shit to-go
Really, I'm a pro
Really on the low
Really like the chill, I just to go out to get the dough

[Hook 3]
They don't want you
They just want Su!

[Verse 3]
Thirty fourth show, they check me like "Woo!"
They don't hear me though, still on PB road
Gotta keep it lit, ain't no CD four
Hit 'em with the start that people never seen before
In and out of town, they see me rock the cleanest clothes
Girl take off that tee before you leave, I need it though
Question every single picture, can't believe it though

[Pre-Hook]
Ayy, they don't want you
Yeah, ayy
Nah, they don't want you
Yeah, ayy

[Hook 1]
They don't want you

And if you ain't real then they don't respect you

[Hook 2]
Nah, they don't want you
They just want Su!
They want Mr. Always-see-me-stunt-with-something-new

[Outro]
