[Hook](Iamsu!)
She call when her man can't get it up
He mad, when he call, she ain't pickin up
Don't be scared ho, you want it, I'll lick it up
I dick her down, nigga you ain't big enough
Bounce on it like a playboy bunny
B-b-bounce on it like a playboy bunny
Bounce on it like a playboy bunny
I beat that pussy like it owe me money

[Verse 1](Iamsu!)

It's the miggidy miggidy miggidy miggidy mack-mack, comin' straight out the bay
And you know I'm bringing' it bringing' it bringing' it bringing' it back, it's H B to the K
Bouncin up and down like bad shocks
Got them OGs watching' like I'm Madlock
Keepin at least 2000 in the stash box
Let her smoke that saliva till she pass out
Back it up, back it up, left cheek, right cheek
Su sick, yeah I got the juice bitch, Hi-C
Pushin through my city like I'm YG
Both chains jangling on my white t

[Hook]

[Verse 2](Tradez)

She text while her man's in the same room
Need extra head like a carpool
Make the frames shake like a pothole
You know I'm all black like a playstation console
You know it's paper on the Visa cash in the pocket
Swisher guts on the dead floor keep it mobby
Shoutsout to my lil bro young bari
And the click full of animals, my party
Sickwitit repper all I gotta do is tell her where the bottles at she gonna down it, and I'mma let her
Th-th-the playboy bunny bounce, I came here cool but you're gonna bring that Richmond out

[Hook]

[Verse 3](Problem)

M-m-m-m-motherfuckin Problem
All these bitches know that though
Got em tryna choose up
Give a bitch a chair and she gonna pick me like an afro
Cheatin like an asshole, solid gold lasso
Dyin all swole, money stupid like coal
Bitch thick like pear, me I'm killin no hi
Ya man say he trappin, no work like Tommy
Ya bitch is where you find me, doin a damn thang
Hello its the gram banging the damn gang
L's up, diamond laying that
Ya baby tight on that ass like a wave cap

[Hook]
