[Verse 1:]
I'm on some extra shit
Gold chain got another one next to it
It's the real deal nah it ain't a test you bitch
Shit I'm thrill as it gets
Spend it all on kicks
I'm from Richie Rich city
Girl respect that shit
Ride across that bridge
From San Francis
Young Suzie lives
With his heart break kiss
And we do just what we wanna
Drinking, smoking marijuana
It ain't racks I won't show 'em
Nigga trip, then it's over
Got your girl bend her over
That's my bottles send it over
Got these models in the coma
Cause we knock that shit out
You ain't from the fuck my nigga, knock that shit off
I got all my homies with me, all my homies with me
Real from the beginning I'll be real until they get me
Quit playing, it's the game in your ear
Make you stay in your lane
Cause we aim at careers

[Hook:]
Quit playing nigga knock that shit off
Knock that shit off, knock knock that shit off
Quit playing nigga knock that shit off
Knock that shit off, knock knock that shit off
So tired of these broke ass niggas
Talking about how they spending that money
Knock that shit off
So tired of these tired ass bitches
Stop talking bitch I'll be all in
Knock that shit off

[Verse 2:]
See all and I smoke marijuana
Got my drag shoes late see I'm running California
Only God can judge me, so motherfucker you on her
I'm about that dough
Call me homie, ye I'm 'bout that dough
Ye I'm about it like Goma
And coma I'm a put your bitch
All your niggas pussy so I get why you be on my dick
Ristlebrick, racky on the fifth I'm foolie right
Jury bright see your fam, watch it like it's movie night
Papers full of gasoline all up in these magazines
Loaded like a magazine
Slow it up, got these niggas hoeing up
Cop shaking their head, just saying like know what's up
I don't owe you nothin, my credits fine
My baby mama's crush grapes, ye they wine
Cause they know I'm getting money so they keep calling
So I ain't got no other choice but to keep ballin

[Hook:]
Quit playing nigga knock that shit off
Knock that shit off, knock knock that shit off
Quit playing nigga knock that shit off
Knock that shit off, knock knock that shit off
So tired of these broke ass niggas
Talking about how they spending that money
Knock that shit off
So tired of these tired ass bitches
Stop talking bitch I'll be all in
Knock that shit off
