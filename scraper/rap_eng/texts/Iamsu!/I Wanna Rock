[Intro]
(Right about now)
Yeah, Yeah
T-Minus, Su
HBK is in the building
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[IamSu!]
This is T-Minus, rappers V-ginas
Its getting real cold, I'ma change the climate
No records sold, not even a deal
And no rapper scares me, not even a little
I came from in the mold, cause all I am is real
And no I'm not a raver so it's never pop a pill
The games in my control like I'm pressing X or Square
And these rappers lame hate the game not the player
I'm amazing and rare, in ways I can share
And I'm so high spend days in the air
My heart goes out to Haiti send money send prayers
Put your hands in the sky for everyone we lost there
But back to the subject, they hate me I love it
You talk about it, but we really does it
HBK get wet or get dry
And every time we step out we get fly
All about my biz no suit and no tie
From the school of hard knocks and you can not apply
I'm real cool but don't get me in a foul mood
Cause if it's beef I'ma kill it while the Cow Moo's
Do what I want to, you do what you allowed to
Tell em where I'm from, I rep my city cause I'm proud to
Suzy you the king tell me why they ain't crowned you
Please tell me that they got some more where they found you
First round knock out, why they want a round two?
These rappers bozo's all they need is clown suits
And a red nose, rich city get dough
Moved from burbs came straight from the ghetto
Baby I'm a champion, faster than a Lamborghini
Sweet candy man, hammer like a handyman
Flow spicy, hot, Thai food
Girl give me stupid brain, low IQ
Men lie Women lie and the numbers lie too
You can hear me coming like a plane when it fly through
And if talent was money, I could buy you
Plus I'm real hungry like the gators in the bayou
Hit me on Twitter, I betcha girl follow me
Yeah I got your juices while these haters try to bottle me
I mean battle me, I need a lobotomy
To get my brain fix I had [?] part of me
This music is a part of me, that's where my hearts is
And my flow hard like a hotel carpet, hah
I'ma finish what you started
T-Minus the takeoff, departed
