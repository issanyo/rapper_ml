[Hook]
I been in the game so long
She ride on me I just hold on
Falling out the pants money so long
Everybody get your mother fucking roll on
I been in the game so long
She ride on me I just hold on
Reaching for my chain player hold on
Everybody get your mother fucking roll on

[Verse 1]
Woke up in Vegas then had to fly back to Cali
I touchdown at 1 hopped in that Yukon Denali
He took me to the arena they put their hands to the ceiling
You would think it's a stick up
You would think that I'm stealing
I'm a hell of a smoker, I'm a bit of a drinker
I'm screaming fuck all my critics but still a critical thinker
All them statements they making, they ain't making no difference
I'm just stacking my Isha, you just lurking my Insta
You niggas acting like bitches you need to switch up your movement
They just mad that we winning like I'm allergic to losing
It's so hard to stay humble, had to keep that shit balanced
I just want a couple million for my brother in Dallas

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling myself
I'm in overdrive like I just got L's
I'm the shit phew that smells
Young hot boy touch me might melt
HBK Gang nigga that's that
Smoke joints so fat it's like a louisville bat
Might just hit a home run on you
I'm the president of Young California
And these niggas trying to take my juice
I bet that shit taste like ammonia
And I bet she gone race to my home then
Bust it open, tell me that I own it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah
HBK yeah you know how we play
HBK yeah you know how we play
Bitch
