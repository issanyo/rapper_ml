Ah, heart breaking that’s all I know
So I’ma keep on repping
Ask about who run it
But it ain’t no question
Had to keep on guessing
Man you know half stepping
And it will be a lesson learnt

[Hook]
Curtains up, lights on, we outta here
Already gone, already gone
E.T. phone home
Imma put on a show, I’ma put on a show
Put on a show, put on a show, put on a show
Oh, oh, oh

Put your life on the line, dedicate to the grind
Meditating for hours, anticipating your time
Once you can, what you do, you took over
You destroyed it, you got all your homies working
What you do, you want blow down
I put on, I swear to God I put on
I rep my gang till it’s over, I say that shit every song
I know my rights when I’m wrong
Know my rights from my wrongs
It was dark in my city, I told em cut the lights on

[Hook]

I was spazzing out, cashing out, on a shit I always wanted
Now I’m trapping out, to get that bread, homie this is my moment
And I won’t drop that bar, not at all
No cow Williams on my life, on the mike
Every time I will kill them
Never planning on fronting, I get straight to the money
Took my mom to Hawaii told her that life is sunny
Told her look at your sonny, look what he did on his own
Told the world bout my home, now they watching the throne
50 made me believe, kanye showed me the way
To be the next b.i.g to be the next pac, to be the next nas
To be the next day
I’m talking bout an icon, show time, curtain up, lights on
Pimp this shit like lights on
Nah nigga we ain’t like y’all

[Hook]
