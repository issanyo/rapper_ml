[Hook 2x: Jay Ant]
Real nigga shit
I don't give a fuck 'bout no bitch
I said real nigga shit
I don't a give a fuck, young nigga what

[Verse 1: Kool John]
All gas like I'm fillin' up
Real nigga shit, bitch listen up
Remember when I didn't have a buck?
I'm on the road gettin' cheese like a mega bus
Bitch, I don't give a fuck like a virgin
Off the 18 down 580 swervin'
I dropped the four up in the liter
Got that thumper on my speaker
Payed the rent off a feature
I, get cashed off of flows
Me and the gang fuck out of state hoes
We be smokin' out hotel floors
Broke hoes, I let 'em go I let 'em go
I be diggin' on them hoes, you be kissin' on them hoes
I be cashin' all them checks, poppin' tags off them clothes
I wanna cop that ghost so I ride spooky
That's real nigga shit like I'm takin' dookies

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Jay Ant]
See, they ain't who they say they is
Man, who you think you playin' with?
You see I'm from the bay, bitch
And where I'm from we don't pay the bitch
See, these niggas still trickin'
Why they still trippin'?
All this free game and they still trippin'
Better tell that bitch chip in
Mob on these hoes, I be mobbin'
They be "Uhh, he might be a real nigga?"
Mob on these hoes, I ain't stoppin'
And they be like "Uhh, he might be a real nigga?"
So why you sippin' on 'em, I ain't trippin' on 'em
If they trippin' then I'm dippin' on 'em
Dippin' on 'em like s-s-s
Bitch, I'm just tryna get rich
And you be all on a bitch
And my family from the Rich
Man, I coulda been a pimp

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
I swear to God I make it look too easy
And every girl around me look too good
I'm pullin' up and all the girls go crazy
They lovin' me in every burb and every hood
Follow the flow
We some young niggas always on the come up
Where we come from it's so muthafuckin' hard to make a come up
But we've done it, look who run it
Like who sayin', you playin', ho we insane
Flow 93 Octane, no game we not playin'
Like me on, Dione, she high, zenon
Broke ho be gone, kick her ass out then I pass out
I guess those were the times I was slept on
Don't put me to the test like a Scantron
Cause we could fail it, and I'll figure it out
I'm screamin' free all of my niggas till my niggas is out
Ooh, and I'm the best without a shadow of doubt
On some Japanese shit that I could barely pronounce
