[Hook: IamSu!]
No new niggas, only real ones
Been a real one and I’m still one
No thousands, I’m talkin bout millions
No thousands, I’m talkin bout millions

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
10k for the show boy
Lot of broke rappers unemployed
Made a lot of money on my last tour
Bet you I could get it if I ask for it
Lot of fake niggas, they be running they mouth
My youngins hitting licks, they might just run in your house
I play this shit and pray they relax
Cause it’s crazy everyday, I'm there where we at
Forgive me for my last song
And every other track I show my ass on, ughh
I’m just speaking from a real place
Finna turn a dollar into Bill Gates
Yeah, a lot of niggas still fake
A lot of broke niggas still hate
Yeah, but I still show the world love
Shop til' I got kicks like the world cup

[Hook x2]
No new niggas, only real ones
Been a real one and I’m still one
No thousands, I’m talking bout millions
No thousands, I’m talking bout millions

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Suzie 6 speed back in effect
Comin back just to smack 'em in the back of they neck
People be actin funny, I be laughing at that
Smoked the kush Til i damn near have a asthma attack
Never pass up the fact, these rappers barely could rap
Rappers circus, run up factors and actors that act
Make Em flip like a acrobat
The flow killing like Kim, she dip it low to the matt
Accurate facts is, they be needin more practice
Kickin that whack shit, I clear it out like Proactive
It’s Heartbreak Gang, partake bang
With us Or be shark bait mane, shark week playing on that flat screen
Black hoodie, white ones, black jeans
Homie that’s me
When they see me they understand that thats green
Been touching 100's since I turned 15
You know what I’m talkin bout?

[Hook x2]
No new niggas, only real ones
Been a real one and I’m still one
No thousands, I’m talkin bout millions
No thousands, I’m talkin bout millions
