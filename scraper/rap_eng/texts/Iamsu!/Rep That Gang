(Intro)
Aye, turn two
My shit, hold up
This shit damn hurt my ears
Haaa

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Uh, 3’s up for that gang, dog
Still rep where I came from
Yea they called me Suzy
They like where you get that name from?
Wearing Bapes like I'm Pusha-T
I don’t trip off my enemies
Cause I’m getting that new money
Young bucks, Tennessee
With the people that been with me
Never switch my loyalty
Ride around, in 2 door whatever
Trynna hustle up to that Bentley
No line, I walk in for free
She so fine, she meant for me
Blog sites, they mention me
I said, ‘pay me more!’ Attention please!
Cause I’m on the grind
I’m turnt up
You boarder line
Get burnt up standing next to mine
Cause young nigga got fuego
Outcasts go San Diego
That’s no charge, I go hard
Leave the cheese behind like Brett Farve aye

(Hook)
All homies get paid
Hustle, grinding all day
Hold it down for my nigga
Hold it down for that nigga
Stay away from the fakes
Stay true to what’s real
No time for them snakes
That’s just how I feel!
So I rep that gang
Yeah I rep that gang (x16)
That heart break gang
Yeah I rep that gang (x5)
That heart break gang

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
More than music, it’s a lifestyle
Uh, did some shows, they all sold out
Uh putting on for my home town
Yeah, never bite get your own sound
When I’m in the building it goes down
Yeah, need ten K for my shows now
I don’t shop for no clothes now
Yeah, I don’t trip for no hoes now
Bread up with my top down
Busting out, I’m like block oww
They’re hating, but I can’t knock ya
I’m just happy I’m not ya
Real ones rock with me
That’s all I’m here for
Money on my mind, stays on my head like earphones

(Hook)
All homies get paid
Hustle, grinding all day
Hold it down for my nigga
Hold it down for that nigga
Stay away from the fakes
Stay true to what’s real
No time for them snakes
That’s just how I feel!
So I rep that gang
Yeah I rep that gang (x16)
That heart break gang
Yeah I rep that gang (x5)
That heart break gang
