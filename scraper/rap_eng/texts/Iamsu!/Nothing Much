West side, dubs up
Whole world gonna love us
Finna fuck this club up
Everyday that's nothing much
West side, dubs up
Whole world gonna love us
Finna fuck this club up
Everyday that's nothing much
Everyday that's nothing much
Everyday that's nothing much
West side, dubs up
Everyday that's nothing much
Everyday that's nothing much
Everyday that's nothing much
West side, dubs up
Everyday that's nothing much

[Verse 1]
Real nigga I think I'm the definition
Listen to my old head he said that success is repetition
Bitch I made like thirty racks before I receive some recognition
And I put on for the bay I need a key to every city
Got a style for every bump on you
Sh-Sh-Shit on everything so pray that I don't take a dump on you
Gave these niggas style my Instagram should be for pay-per view
Associate with yall I really think I'm incapable, do my shit like the Geisha's do
Understand, get a grip on what I'm saying
If I show up then they paying, never hold my stage vacant
On some real shit, never bring a new chick where you staying
I go harder than a bitch, yeah my flow on Super Saiyan
And it's HBK the gang, th-th-these niggas ain't in my lane
Fu-Fu-Fuck a piece bruh I want the whole thing
D-D-Dot Com bitch check the domain
I'm wild as hell, I got style as well
I got beats for sale and I'm working
I-I'm in the gut like a surgeon, so tell these niggas it's curtains (Aye)

[Verse 2]
Six footer, fuck the T.J. Hooker
My girl a looker, and what I spit is coke cooked up
P-Paper chasing, I hustle trying to stack a book up
And you might see me in the sky if you decide to look up
M-My teams straight, my money in a briefcase
Her ass puffy, I told her get a cheesecake
My bread scruffy, I never get a clean shave
Cause where I'm from it's extra extra grimy these days
Go-Go-Gold grilling feelings something like a million
Bitches told me I was ugly it ain't ever hurt my feelings
Cause they all on the dick, I go harder than a bitch
And I'm p-pulling c-c-cash out like credit cards don't exist
And I'm ready for whatever, so tell whatever be prepared
I'm never tripping, if you want the bitch then we can share
T-T-Turn the bass up let them hear the speakers blare
I want the thrown so you gonna have to give me the chair
