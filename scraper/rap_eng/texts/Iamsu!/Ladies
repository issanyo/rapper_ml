[Intro: IamSu!]
Uhuh, yeah
HBK yeah you know how we play

[Verse 1: JT The 4th]
Everytime I would pull up (skurr)
I could get you to smile, give me while it's all good
You know it's all good, all love, always
You know the 4th's on his job on his off days
I ball like the Barclays, since we were in hallways
Rappin' like 4-tay, can we skip foreplay?
We can go far away, it's whatever you wanna do
You know I fuck with you, when I call know I'm coming through (brrt)
Used to be outside, now we up in here
What can I say you on a roll like a wheelchair?
Stayed here, been there, time pass, still care
How I gotta key if love don't live there, yeah

[Hook: Derek King]
All the times, yeah
I see you grindin'
I love your mind say "I've been watchin', I've been watchin'"
(So this song's) For all my ladies
(Hands up, hands up, hands up now, ay, ay)
For all my ladies

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Yeah, pull up on it, she really from [?] (skurr, skurr)
She left with me and the Uber came [?] under
I'm in my vibe, I ain't even hit my prime yeah
I'm 'bout the blow, girl you know that I'm a ball player
Time flown, she make [?] more risk
Put me in the game code, you know I'm a squad [?]
Take her to the [?], she staring, she look gorgeous
She's about it, just like 4th in the next [?]
I'm nothing just like these other boys in this point
I could pretty much do the things that I want
Nothing's sweet but these swishers, so we keep it blunt
She got some B's in the back then in the front
Ayy

[Hook: Derek King & IamSu!]
All the times, yeah (Swear to God)
I see you grindin' (Woah, woah)
I love your mind say "I've been watchin', I've been watchin'"
(HBK yeah you know how we play)
(So this song's) For all my ladies
(Hands up, hands up, hands up now)
For all my ladies

[Bridge: Derek King]
For all the times we chill
I wish that I could be there
I wish that you could be here
I wish that we could be here
For all the times we chill
I wish that I could be there
I wish that you could be here
I wish that we could be here

[Outro: Derek King]
For all my ladies, yeah
For all my ladies, yeah
