[Intro: Iamsu!]
Start going fucking ballistic on somethin'
Anyway, Skip, what up
It's only one way baby, and that's up

[Hook: Iamsu!]
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine by me
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine by me
By me, by me, by me, yeah
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine by me

[Verse 1: Skipper]
Straight out the Rich with it
Center Ave to be specific
When niggas laugh at you if you wasn't gettin' it
So get the money, get the bitches was the only mission
As an adolescent started learning 'bout depression
Short comers as a youth you start to feel the pressure
Learning lessons from my elders tryin' get the message
Gotta grind for what you want, you gotta put in effort
Figured out a long time ago how this grind would go
Overcoming the obstacles seem impossible
Set the example 'cause you know the kids be watching you
Keep a middle finger for niggas thinking they stopping you
2012 I told you niggas that I want the glory
Don't get respect until you pop, but that's another story
Sleeping on me still in a different category
Legendary, HBK my brothers, it's hereditary
Let's get it

[Hook: Iamsu!]
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine by me
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine by me
By me, by me, by me, yeah
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
I want it all, do whatever, except for sell my soul
Taking trips around the world that's just to tell my story
Can't throw a fish in the air, then expect it to fly
You out your element, thinking you compared to the guy
Your club bangers don't bang the club
We want W's instead of dubs, you know, yeah
I drop through for 25 like a gumball
Niggas complaining 'bout dick riders 'til they jump off
Artist's claim Heartbreak Gang when it's been official
Steal your ad-libs, flows, and your instrumentals
All with the intent of never ever working with Su
Pause, blow the whistle, we gon' clarify the issue
I'm only 27 and I'm already a legend
I broke the glass ceiling for bay area progression
The west kept secret, don't forget that I'm the best one
But yet and still niggas treat me like a step son
Let's get it

[Hook: Iamsu!]
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine by me
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine by me
By me, by me, by me, yeah
I do legendary shit with my legendary clique
Out the ordinary's fine
