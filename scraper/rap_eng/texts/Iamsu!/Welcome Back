[Intro]
Welcome back
Welcome back
Welcome back

[Verse 1]
Tell them niggas I’m back, put my life on the line
They want that real shit back, my homies told me it’s time
So I looked at my watch, it was what it was
Baby pop that pussy, drop it down for a thug
I’m always in, pink dolphin
I tell them haters pick a coffin, I’m done talking
I’m in my office sipping coffee, real Richmond
Where they turn babies into orphans
For me, I made it out that bitch, it was never an option
Where people looking, I’m the bullet watching
In LA with Problem, he straight out the Compton
I’m straight out the ...store, walking down with bags
And my girlfriend body like a hourglass
When I smoke, it get foggier than shower glass
Money by the minute, I won’t let a hour pass
Ugh, so they like go and talk that shit
I’m so deep off in your girl
Might lose my phone off in that bitch
Go crazy with the style, they bring up your name and say who like an owl
We running this bitch but don’t know about y’all
My money so tall, It's just like Yao Ming
Pay attention when I sing, all these rappers I’m fathering
Everything came but ain’t bout a brink
Levi’s no robin jeans

[Hook]
Yeah I’m back and I’m shining on these niggas
Yeah I’m back and I’m stunting on these hoes
Yeah I’m back and I’m shining on these niggas
Yeah I’m back and I’m stunting on these hoes
Tell them niggas I’m back, put my life on the line
They want that real shit back, my homies told me it’s time
So I looked at my watch, it was what it was
So pop that pussy, drop it down for a thug
Welcome back, welcome back

[Verse 2]
What’s understood should never be explained
Blinks bitch I’m quick, I had to tnt the game
Ball all out on tv, I tnt the game
Killer got me leaning so much that I need a cane
I’m so stupid with this flow I think I need a brain
My swag on outer space, I do not need a lane
I exceed the lane you peanut brain
...your girlfriend been with me so much that it’s been a shame
