(Hook)
I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life

(Hook)
I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life

(Verse 1)
I be in the trap I be in the burbuns
I don't like snitches man they make me nervous
Tight jeans but I will be jerkin
Bout green like a ninja turtle
I be high I be blowin purple
And I stay going in like a damn carfue
I'm from the bay where they cook the mercure
Keep it real never go commercial
I get in her stomach like she met a marshal
The middle of the rich where they steady lurking
Know some real niggers in the trap working
That will get up on your hair like a damn turtle

(Hook)
I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life

(Verse 2)
Pressure put the track rolling like a burger
You was writing raps, I was selling purple
Ain't no rooms for squares in my inner circle
All I want no 60 park round kick commercial
Everything I say ye I really mean it
Gimme head when I cut ye I guillotine it
Hoes yell a nigga name when I'm in between it
Bust in sunk on like the late gille
Shout out to the locals they the one that made me
All fake 100 chained up talking slavery (Django)
Diamond lame game got 'em going crazy
My mother fucking baba only want the fame

(Hook)
I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
I said I need it in my life
