[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
In the morning first thing I do is roll up, then I think of you
And all I wanna do, to you, when I see you (see you)

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, girl I won’t waste your time
(won’t waste your time, won’t waste your time)
Oh yeah, I know these other niggas told you lies
And sold you dreams, oh
Girl I won’t waste your time
(won’t waste your time, won’t waste your time)
Oh yeah, I know these other niggas told you lies
And sold you dreams, oh

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I wanna lay your body down and kiss you all over cause I miss you
Its been a minute since we did it
Make it easier to fit in
You ain’t like these other bitches
I don’t gotta worry about where your pussy been
So I don’t mind licking
Even kissing it over and over and over again
You got respect for your nigga
You say I’m the best that you’ve been with
You ain’t worry bout a bitch
You’re confident, I believe in you
Girl you do it on your own and all I know is you’re the truth

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Uh, she gon get it from a nigga
There can’t be no other way
From the Bay but she live in L.A
So i hit it on the underground and stay up out the way
She wanna fuck with a rapper
She wanna fuck with a real nigga
Told her pick a side
Good pussy keep my dick alive
Pull it out, put it back inside
I’m the God she get baptized
You a good girl on the dark side
She good enough to take her worldwide
Let her on the bus when we on tour
Caught up in the game it ain’t no cure
They can tell that she was different
How I spoke to her, how I vibe with her
How my thoughts and my dreams come alive with her
She be [?] no matter what the time difference is
Different city, different bitch
Tell that ho, ball with ya boy
Always hold it down with ya boy
When I’m tryna smoke, she be rolling up a pound with ya boy
She was lost got found with ya boy, aye
Oh yeah, and she respect me
She ain’t ask for a cent when the check came
She my right hand, never tell the left mane
X-games, now she do tricks when we sexing, aye
