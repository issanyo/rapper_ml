[Intro: IamSU]
Everywhere we go, every city, all over the world

[Verse 1: IamSU]
I know you hate me on my songs like "is he serious?"
Well this my room, we all alone, and baby here we is
Can I kiss you on that floor, can I drink the nectar?
Can I grab you by the neck and make a- just smash you
She like for me to fuck her while she on her stomach
Aiming for that tattoo, yeah that's my type of woman
Yeah that's my type of woman
Scratchin', bitin' type of woman

[Hook:P-LO]
I just wanna take my time
Take my time with you
Baby can I touch a little bit?
Baby can I touch a little bit?

[Bridge: Skipper][x4]
Shorty she got that ocean
Shorty put it in motion
Shorty throw it back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Ant]
Now tell me how it feel
Said tell me how it feel
To know that I'm a real one
To know that this shit real
To know that this is real
Tell me how it feel
When I'm in that, get in between that
Tell me how it feel
Tell me how it feel when you know that this is real

[Hook]
