[INTRO: P-Lo]
Whoa, yeah
HBK, you know how we play
And I can't quit all I know is gang shit

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Got a bitch from the 9-1-6
She don't give head but she suck my dick, no shit
Shorty is a bad little freak though
Touch your toes turn around let me beat those
Super head sequel, make a movie with her
I don't ever call never go to dinner
She rolling with a winner, ball like Reggie Miller
Give a bitch good wood never get a splinter
She already know when the phone ring
Take her to the crib, give her long thing
Put her hands on my balls like she bowling
HBK keep the money rolling
I don't blow dank, you rappers low rank
Phone deposits on, 2 gold chains
And the cold thing I ain't drop a tape yet
You already played out like a tape deck

[Hook: IamSu!]
It's like everywhere I go
All these ladies know my name
I swear it's like everywhere I go
They be repping Heart Break Gang
And you gotta come up if you wanna get down with me
If you look good take you all through the town with me
Gotta come up if you wanna get down with me
If you look good take you all through the town with me

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
No fakers only real niggas among us
Getting green like fungus don't trust
[?], I treat a chick like a tissue
I get blown away she get thrown away it's not an issue
I won't ever tell you I love you won't tell you I miss you
But I will get you in the bed give you lead like a pencil
I'm so ahead of these rappers that I'm a torso
I mean beats and I'm hungry won't leave them more so
Moreso, I'm balling no court though
You sweeter than some lemonade on the porch bro
Might catch me courtside at the Oracle
Fifteen hundred for a beat with the chorus bro
Little cheesed up like I'm finna take a picture
If that's your girl please please don't bring her with you
If I ain't feeling your vibe it's finna be an issue
If I ain't feeling your vibe it's finna be an issue
Suzy

[Hook]

[OUTRO: IamSu!]
Uh, what you mean huh
Yeah, what you mean huh
HBK you niggas know how we play
Uh, yeah
And I can't quit all I know is gang shit
My nigga Rudy in this bitch
