[Hook: IamSu!]
Red Cup, red cup, red cup, red cup
Red Cup, red cup, whats up in your red cup
Red Cup, red cup, red cup, red cup
Red Cup, red cup, whats up in your red cup
I'm fucked up, fucked up, fucked up, fucked up
I'm fucked up, fucked up, fucked up, fucked up
I'm fucked up, fucked up, fucked up, fucked up
I'm fucked up, fucked up, fucked up, fucked up

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Tell a friend to tell a friend
Suzy ball like a varsity letterman
Matter of fact approach and tell security to let us in
And it don't matter how quickly I let this cheddar spin
I still get dough so tell them haters have a heart attack
Let em know I got the snap back no starter cap
It's HBK we rep the bay and yes we brought it back
I threw some D on that bitch like I bought a 'lac
Uh, no rich boy but I'm from the rich boy
Murder everything there ain't a beat that I won't destroy
My crew [?] beat it up [?]
Hoes paper that I'm stacking, bang out like they let Shaq in
Suzy baby baby Suzy crazy than a bitch
I abuse these ladies they be all up on a nigga dick
They been choosing lately on these laid back niggas from the rich
And if I'm sipping something you can bet that I'll be double fisted with my

[Hook]

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
Red cup said it on the last song bruh
HBK you know the cash long bruh
This that drink you can't pass on bruh
She too bad I can't pass on her
I'm too cold [?]
Say you ain't popping and I know you lying
On another planet man I think I'm flying
Beating all these hoes and I ain't even trying
HBK plus RC
Broke rappers getting money hardly
Make your girl ride me like a Harley
My whole crew smoking like a Marley
Play them like Atari, no turning
Sip is slow, dro burning
More earnings, like I'm corperate
P-Lo getting drunker than a swordfish

[Hook]
