Flexing on my ex like stupid bitch and never see me

He can't run away we see his license plate
I got a addiction, I need a money prescription
And bitch I'm straight trippin', if that shit coming I'm missin'
If you thought that you running, we 'bout to make a transition
And Suzy make the decisions, then Showy make the revisions
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, that money uncommitted
A hundred minimum [?]
I'm 'bout to take responsibility asking who did it
Really detached from my feelings
Stacking these racks to the ceiling
I'm Show Banga, I get 30 for a show now
It's blue faces, every day I raise your profile
DaveO breakin' the dope down and rollin' smoke clouds
I let her look at my account and she got grossed out
They don't got no style
[?]
