[Intro]
Ayy
HBK, yeah you know how we play
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Paupa got beats, makin' hits on god

[Verse]
You ever went overseas and made G's?
Moonwalking in a pair of 23's
The streets talking, they sayin' Suzy got heat
Pop up, shut the whole Bay down on Halloween
Stuffing racks in my jeans
Hopping out them trucks
Hopping in, whole team since 2013
Killing every beat I touch and getting off clean
I know every single thing I touch is down to make green
Factor, money in the bank plus mattress
Money got me floatin' through the city like Aladdin
You just got it, but you know we been had it
And get is the way, Heart Break be the gang, hey

[Outro]
You already know what time it is
It's only one way, baby
HBK Gang over everythang, it's your boy IamSu!
HotNewHipHop, man, appreciate the love
