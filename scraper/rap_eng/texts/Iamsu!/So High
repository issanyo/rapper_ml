[Intro: Iamsu!]
Yeah I’m so high
Yeah I’m so high

[Hook: Iamsu!]
Man I get so fly
We in the building, don’t let your girl go
I’m too cool to pass
And someone said I got a big ego

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
It’s the one I can feel it
You in this bitch with the realest
Spanish women, they love me like Kumbia and tequila
And that body so crazy it got me all in my feelings
Like god damn baby how is Vicky keeping that secret?
I’m from the Bay where the doors open
So I can’t help but be a gentleman
I heard your boyfriend is super childish
He got you feeling like a kid again
But you a grown-up, you make your own decisions in life
So if I invite you, you have no problem spending the night
I’ve got infinite possibilities, we do what you like
Going rounds, baby, I hope you could put up a fight
Because tonight we living life like we turned eighteen
With a sight for sore eyes you’ll be my Visine
And I’m out with my squad, so you bring your team
It’s the middle of the night so live out your dreams

[Hook: Iamsu!]
Man I get so fly
We in the building, don’t let your girl go
I’m too cool to pass
And someone said I got a big ego

[Verse 2 – Iamsu!]
You know I’ve got a thing for you, you know I got it
I know you don’t come around for just anybody
Five in the morning girl we in the lobby
What’s next, undress, hands on your body
I love your style, I love your smile, I love your energy
Long hair like you came from the Philippines
Plus you don’t ever worry about the little things
Because that things so big when it’s in them jeans
And I know everybody trying to see what’s up with us
Took a trip to L.A., we in Supperclub
Always down to run a play, we can double up
Me plus you is great just to sum it up

[Hook: Iamsu!]
Man I get so fly
We in the building, don’t let your girl go
I’m too cool to pass
And someone said I got a big ego

[Outro: Iamsu!]
She want to hang with the gang
Have a [?]
She want to, she want to
She want to hang with the gang
She want to do her own thing
Yeah
