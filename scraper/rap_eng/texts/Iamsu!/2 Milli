[Verse 1]
Ok, I woke up this morning
Told myself I’ma go get it
All this hbk ganging
I put on for my city
All my thugs keep it g
And that G stand for giving
I’m just chillin mindin my bindess
That’s the gang way, get with it
I live my life to the limit
Ain’t no bullshit, no gimmicks
So when you say I’m your nigga
Dawg I hope that you mean it
Cause I’m down for my homies
Yeah I’m down for my dawgs
I swear to god that I’m real
So don’t hesitate to call
I put my faith in my god
I put no trust in no broad
And no nobody get bust nothin
So we have to provide
That means we bum rush that shit
Tell them just like this

[Hook]
Labels tryina sign me, I need 2 mill for this shit
2 mill for this shit, 2 mill for this shit
Labels tryina sign me, I need 2 mill for this shit
2 mill for this shit, 2 mill for this shit
Before I lay down this evening
Best believe I’m scheming
Best believe I’m grinding
Y’all niggas just dreaming
A lil homie keep dreaming, wish my grand daddy could see me
Told my mama I’ma do it
I ain’t say that shit for no reason
A lil homie keep dreaming, wish my grand daddy could see me
Told my mama I’ma do it
I ain’t say that shit for no reason
A lil homie keep dreaming, wish my grand daddy could see me
Told my mama I’ma do it
I ain’t say that shit for no reason
