[Intro:]
HBK yea you know how we play
And I can't quit, all I know, all I know, all I know is

[Hook: IamSu!]
Fly shit is all I do
Only worry about me, I don't care bout you
I just mixed the drink in with my juice
I'm feelin' hella good, I don't know bout you
Yea, I'm feelin' hella good
Hella good, hella good, hella good, hella good
Hella good, hella good, hella good, hella good
We ain't worry bout 'em

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Woke up to that paper, that paper I'm chasin'
Pedal to the metal for the cash, I be racin'
Suzy six speedin', no there ain't no replacement
Smoke like a Rasta or Haitian, Jamaican
Girls goin' crazy, they need more security
Fresh up out exotic shadow ready for the jewelry
2015, got my mind on a trillion
I won't go away cause my swag too resilient
Keep the bullshit, I got my own lane
Treat the rap game like the dope game
She know me by my alias not my whole name
She just know the bracelet match both chains
God damn, shot nothin' but the net
HBK, I'mma represent
Don't say shit, nigga cut the check
All I really wanna do is flex
And you know what I do

[Hook: IamSu!]

[Bridge: IamSu!]
HBK yeah you know how, HBK yeah you know how
And I can't quit, all I know is, all I know is
And I can't quit, all I know is

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Pullin' up, double R on the rear, license plate say I don't care
Walkin' round up in Times Square, they said son you a millionaire
And my son a millionaire
Snakes cut no grass so I gas brown drink
Large bank in my LK tank
Fucked around and stripped the breaks
Got Picassos in the safe
Bracelet like a lake, tell Suzy pump the base
Never lose, we and Suze run they snooze
Spillin' bands on my boosts
I got hoes, cut 'em loose
And I chunk the up deuce and my homies do too
You a bird in the coupe, I'm a king, thought you knew nigga

[Hook: IamSu!]

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Woke up to that paper, that paper, I need it
Freshman always in the mirror, I'm conceited
She don't drink the mic off cause she gotta beat it
Real life Dipset, girl I really mean it
Still ridin' round like I'm broke
Still with your girl on the low
Everybody see me on the hype
No Juve bitch, I need it in my life
Pull up to a bumper like a parallel park
Shining so hard you could see me in the dark
Grass cuttin', no snakes in my yard
Hope my haters keep a special place in their heart for me
God damn, shot nothin' but the net
HBK, I'mma represent
Don't say shit nigga, just cut the check
All I wanna do is flex
And you know what I wanna do

[Hook: IamSu!]
