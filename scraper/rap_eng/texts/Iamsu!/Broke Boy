[Chorus: IamSu!]
If I want it I’m a go for it
I can never ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
If I want it I’m a go for it
I can never ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Used to work a square job
But like the jailhouse I had to bail out
This million dollar dream can’t fail now
Always gotta do it big, can’t scale down
Rap niggas falling in a circle
I’m doing pop shit, I’m bout to go commercial
She see me on the TV screen
I’m a hit it harder than a DDT
All red Timbs, these BBC’s
Hella money for a feature
You should see these fees
Make my life into a move gotta 3D me
Hypebeast online tryna buy my sneaks
Iamsu, say my name
Niggas swagger jacking tryna steal my lane
Till you go through it can’t feel my pain
We gon’ ball till we fall cause we still in the game
Let's go!

[Chorus: IamSu!]
If I want it I’m a go for it
I can never ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
If I want it I’m a go for it
I can never ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy

[Verse 2: Royce The Choice]
Work on my tail, not going to jail
Blower on my lap and it’s warm as hell
Dice game got whacked and that Olds for sale
Like a Baltimore cap got the bros to trail
DC stadium away repping, Houston walked the prime time high stepping
A Town’s probably the same damn thing
Bitches picking up a single like a speed date
He came to as balling nigga mean he fake
Humor at the fact to get an up we stay moving
Cause with my lil bro dude was looking at nine
Now he dont come home until he’s sub 29
The code life, you ever watch the Super Bowl in France
You’re my whole advance read about them different pants
I’m saying my younger homie out here in a Rolls Royce
Nigga I can never ever be a broke boy

[Chorus: IamSu!]
If I want it I’m a go for it
I can never ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
If I want it I’m a go for it
I can never ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy

[Verse 3: RJ]
Made it out the streets help me make a rep
Flew an OT Breezy help me rap
Almost went broke had to bounce back
N my last rope with a loud pack
Way back when my teacher took roll
I was deep in my notes
I ain’t talking bout writing no sentence
Mean like before they blew lugs
I was getting my dough
I remember them hunnids
I still got them hunnids, I jug in abundance
You want it I run it
Got work and it’s coming
Smoke in a public I blow out my budget
It’s gone when I touch it
I’m on and I love it
Cause I
I was fresh outta school took some country blues
Fighting over food I ain’t never chewed
I’m never turning back like I
Paralysed to the fact like I
Getting rich off a mack and I

[Chorus: IamSu!]
If I want it I’m a go for it
I can never ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
If I want it I’m a go for it
I can never ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
Never ever ever be a broke boy
