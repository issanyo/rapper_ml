[Intro: IamSu!]
Ah, damn cuz
It's 3:33 in the fucking morning
So many things I could say
But Imma just say this

[Hook: Average White Band]
The sooner you give
The sooner you get to have (3,2,1 bitch)
A love of your own, ooh (Oh yeah, leggo)
The longer it takes, the better you come to know
A love of your own

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Oh, and one more thing
The game is not to be sold
And not to be told, my brother
Blahhh, blahhh

[Verse 2: Average White Band]
Don't deny
Don't deny it to yourself
Don't you be afraid, just walk right on in
The door is standing open, you know I'm always hoping
Oooh
