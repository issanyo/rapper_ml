[Intro]
Lil Rece produced it
Lil Rece produced it
Lil Rece produced it
These chains [?]
All this weed, all these bitches ain't a thang to me
Might be something to you

[Hook: Kool John]
It ain't a thang
It ain't a thang
Pull up in a foreign, ain't a thang
Smoking out the pound, it ain't a thang (stacking hunnids)
It ain't a thang
Just blew a bag, it ain't a thang
Don't talk, girls screaming out money ain't a thang

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
I do not believe in myth, it ain't a thang
I do not know you from a, can of paint
Damn I miss the old Su, it's no the same
I think they like it way better when I was lame
Now I'm a boss man, I'm buying thangs
Eating more exotic food, I'm trying thangs
Heartbreak Shmoplife, this every day
Eyes on Me the label, that's the way

[Verse 2: Skipper]
Counting G's, blowing trees, it ain't a thang
I ain't here to play around, I'm in the game
Things are back we on the road, we switching lanes
Niggas still be hating though, that shit insane
Baby just [?] she can stay away
If you hear the nigga phone, have a money place
Know me by my first name when I'm in the Bay
All of these deposits really make a nigga day

[Hook: Kool John]
It ain't a thang
It ain't a thang
Pull up in a foreign, ain't a thang
Smoking out the pound, it ain't a thang (stacking hunnids)
It ain't a thang
Just blew a bag, it ain't a thang
Don't talk, girls screaming out money ain't a thang

[Verse 3: Dave Steezy]
You know me, I got mad sauce, it ain't a thang
I got bitches on me now, just like I'm mace
Jiggy motherfucker that's gon' bring her to your face
I could take your bitch just like a shot without a chase, yeah
I like women, I got style, my girl in the Bay
People around they sayin', you know I'm fast in every lane
Moving like a mob boss and I got good [?]
[?] cup of noodles even at fashion week, gang

[Verse 4: Kool John]
It ain't a thang
I could fuck your bitch, it ain't a thang
Ain't nothing change but my chain
Shmop Boy, I be gassing like a brand new mustang
I be smoking on the bestest no debatin'
Like Lil Boosie [?]
Lame niggas make me agitated
Like niggas, niggas mad I made it

[Hook: Kool John]
It ain't a thang
It ain't a thang
Pull up in a foreign, ain't a thang
Smoking out the pound, it ain't a thang (stacking hunnids)
It ain't a thang
Just blew a bag, it ain't a thang
Don't talk, girls screaming out money ain't a thang
