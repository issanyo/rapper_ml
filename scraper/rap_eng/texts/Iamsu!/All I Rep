(Intro: IamSU!)
Uh
HBK, yeah, you know how we play
Yep, Yep

(Verse 1: IamSU!)
Stay true, plenty changed on the way
But it still HB to the K
I'm from the bottom of the bottom of the bottom
And whatever it is, all my homies whilin'
You could feelin my vision, sayin' I'm on the way
All the way in the New Wap
And though I still hold it for the Bay
Still hold it down for the Rich
Hold it down for my fam'
Tell the world 'bout my movement
Let 'em know who I am
Represent like I should, keep it real to the core
Ho about the money, I'm screaming give me more
I'm peeving down to the floor, I'm buying Jordans for fun
Finna take over the world
And give it all to my son
Telling me I'm the one so I'm second to none
Barely learning to fly, it's only just begun
I'm on like the street lights, so they tell me go in
I learn from my old head, don't fix it if it's broken
My girl so way she soakin', and I want every drop
On my way to the mountain and I will never stop

[Hook: IamSU!]
All I rep is that gang
HBK, yeah, you know how we play
All I rep is that gang
And I can't quit, all i know is gang shit
All I rep is that game
HBK, Yeah you know how we play
All I rep is that game
And I can't quit, all i know is gang shit

(Verse 2: IamSU!)
Came up faster than helium
Too trill, ain't nobody realer than, them
And cook, coke,flow you can call Villimin
Phoney never ever realla feel this is realer than
Young and wild how I hustle
I always knew by the grind just to apply every muscle
And this is what it comes to
Real niggas out the struggle
On the bubble
Tryin' to maintain and just stay about the trouble
On the double
Shit it hard, but really tell me what's easy
Coming where we come from, it was hard to believe it
I seen it in the dream, so I gotta get it by any means
