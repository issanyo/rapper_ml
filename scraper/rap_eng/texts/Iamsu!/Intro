[Chorus]
Smoking out
Pouring up
Keep that lean up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood
In my hood they call it "buck"
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall

[Hook]
I don't care
(Do what you do x4)
I don't care
(Do what you do x4)

[Verse 1]
And my city's on, Che Guevara
Suzy baby, don't compare 'em
I think it's time I step out on my own
So much confusion and doubt in my home
How you stay grounded when you growin' wings?
Take all yo' pain write it down in a song
Take all yo' homies and go put 'em on
Stages, checks, and television

[Interlude]
But ain't nothin' change (But ain't nothin' change)
(Ain't nothing, ain't, ain't nothing)
Still HeartBreak gang (Still HeartBreak gang )
(H-B-K nigga-know-how-we-play)
But ain't nothin' change (But ain't nothin' change )
(Ain't Nothing,ain't, ain't nothing)
Still HeartBreak gang (Still HeartBreak gang )
(H-B-K nigga-know-how-we-play)

[Chorus]
Smoking out
Pouring up
Keep that lean up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood
In my hood they call it "buck"
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall

[Hook]
I don't care
(Do what you do x4)
I don't care
(Do what you do x4)

[Outro]
Glad you all made it
Right now it's no secret, the odds were never in our favor
Somehow "if" never entered the equation
Of course some days are harder than others
Shit even now, with so much more of the journey left to go
Consider this
The concrete from which he rose
Blending in, was the safest route to see the next day
Sincerely yours
