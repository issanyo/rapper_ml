[Intro: Azure]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I ain't gonna kick you no knowledge this year
We just gon' bounce

[Verse: Azure]
Ah you steppin' with the boy
Flying down this road while I'm kissing on a joint
My hair blowing, I'm hair blowing this noise
And my girl give me pink while I beat it like Floyd
That's nasty huh?
My voice raspy huh?
And I've hangin' out the window of your passenger
So hold on, I blow strong
Just to get my float on
I paint my city on these words like a postcard
From Oak-Town to Frisco my whole sound is wicked
They lovin' how the boy is spittin'
Cause I got them spinnin', grinnin'
Gettin faded like denim
And I throw salt at these rappers cause they dinner
So pump your speakers make them high hats bounce
And tell your haters how you like me now
I know you feeling me uh
The whole world trying to bite my style
My girl is quiet but it's funny how I pipe that down

[Pre-Chorus: Azure]
So get your mind blown, still puffin on hydro
Ain't no tellin' where we might go
But as long I'm here with the right folks
I lay back with my eyes closed
So holla at me

[Chorus: IAMSU]
Cause I'm in town, if you're down
Feel so good when you're around
Lets get and we'll get found
I just want to enjoy myself

[Verse: Azure]
The sky stay blue where we be at
I rep my city all day like bi-atch
I heat back up and beat tracks up
And if your highs coming down we can chief back up
The jeep out the garage, I creep out of mirage
This heartbreaker got you up in his vibe
Yo, I cut these hoes out like like a fuckin' collage
And get your punk, make it bump to bump then we can jump
And I don't drink no Voss water or Cristal
But I got this Nas cd, some Gil Scott
Heron, I'm blarin', don't whip a McLaren
But I'm about to have your mind doin' Benz with the lyrics
I got a couple girls crushing on me
I grew in the burbs but get love in the streets and um
And um free when I write these rhymes
I give you bar after bar like a Friday night

[Pre-Chorus: Azure]
So get your mind blown, still puffin on hydro
Ain't no tellin' where we might go
But as long I'm here with the right folks
I lay back with my eyes closed
So holla at me

[Chorus: IAMSU]
Cause I'm in town, if you're down
Feel so good when you're around
Lets get and we'll get found
I just want to enjoy myself

[Bridge: IAMSU]
We can dip off get lost or whatever
We can dip off
We can dip off get lost or whatever
We can dip off

[Outro: Azure & IAMSU]
Like uh
As we, as we
Jump over the moon
I keep the Hennessey up in my spoon
Like uh, like uh
Never give a fuck

Yeah
Side of town
Feel so when good when you're around
I dont want to let you down
I'm in love with your energy
Put it back to where the hook was
