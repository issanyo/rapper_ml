[Verse 1: IAMSU]

It fell off then I put the Bay back on
This is popcorn, make the beats I rap on
Kill 'em, kill 'em kill 'em, kill 'em kill 'em
She a, dirty, bitch, man she need penicillin
Stacking, cake up to the ceiling
Finna blow the damn roof
Block hot as Cancun and I’m like a bamboo
I got real niggas with me classified, and says a group
Everytime we in the streets they say the animals is loose
I be wigging on the beat bro
Killing shit, these lame things I got a cheat code
I’m in beast mode, tell these other rappers keep grinding
Like my back turned to 'em everybody behind me
Come and face me, I assassinate beats
Rich City raised me, Pennsylvania 8th street
Harbor way riding down the South Side
18th in Ohio, my first bike ride

[Hook]
I be riding through my city feeling something like the mayor
If you getting money put your hands up in the air
Niggas say they hate me but see I don’t really care
HBK the gang, we in this thang, we ain’t going nowhere
We ain’t going nowhere, nowhere, nowheeerre
We ain’t going nowhere, nowhere, nowheeerre
We ain’t going nowhere, nowhere, nowheeerre
We ain’t going nowhere, nowhere, nowheeerre

Switch styles, turn around, peep the dismount
Air Jordan junkie got 'em scared to pull them kicks out
I ain’t even touch her but she screaming like my dick's out
West Side nigga but I make your bitch dip South
I’m juiced up, like the batteries included
Tryna keep up with me, you ain’t got the salary to do it
Top 10 nation wide, academic student of the game
Niggas lame, I’ma show you how to do it
I’m bathing apes, 1 in 80 number since '88 I’ve been crazy straight
I got plenty of niggas that’s really bout that shit
They got artillery like a naval base, ah (AH)
I’m so fragrant with the style, I play daddy to these rappers
So may god bless the child
Got her roping like the car in the garage backing out
Got her giving me massage to my dick with her mouth, ah
(And everyday is with a happy ending
Then I’m right back in the streets, right back to winning)

We ain’t going nowhere, nowhere, nowheeerre
We ain’t going nowhere, nowhere, nowheeerre
We ain’t going nowhere, nowhere, nowheeerre
We ain’t going nowhere, nowhere, nowheeerre
