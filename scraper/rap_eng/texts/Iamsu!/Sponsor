[Verse 1]
There ain't too many rappers like me, I promise
When I say I'm the hottest baby I'm just bein' honest
I'm the definition of hard work and dedication
You see that I'm tailor made for any situation
Get on beats and show my ass, like a nudist
HBK, we the youngest and the truest
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me doggy but you knew this
If it ain't money then you really sound stupid
Big boy green you got little man syndrome
Brand new whip same color as her skin tone
Red bone paint with the yellow bone interior
You talk about the hood but no we do not take you serious
I owe you niggas nothin I did this all by my lonesome
Soon as it gets cold I bet nobody call my cell phone
Rappers get sensitive when you don't bring their name up
But all I got to say to these niggas is step they game up

[Hook]
I know they don't like me, but I don't really care, no no
I know they don't like me, and I don't really care, no no
I know they don't like me, but I don't really care, no no
I just get my money, and throw it in the air, air yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, big money no sponsor
I'm from the Rich where it gets liver than a concert
Summer jam mane ball and pull a hamstring
They call me the president but I ain't run no campaign
I'm on my Obama shit, maybe even Biden
Lookin' for them niggas where they at stop hidin'
Can't fuck with too many people cuz niggas be lyin'
I murk every beat I touch I'm barely even trying
A young alien I'm on this, no paleontologist
But dig me, no fossil shit
Girl just suck me and swallow bitch
My repertoire is so bizarre
Hottest out you know we are
If you don't know heartbreak kids
We'll kill you with no regard
[?]
Got me spittin' like a fucking slow retard
I make beats just like the Neptunes and a fuckin' young Mozart
Hotter than a camel fart
You act like I can't go hard
See me with yo chick I give her private dick like [?]

[Hook]
