[Intro]
Yeah, uhuh, yeah
Uhuh, yeah
My last check feeling like my first rack
My last check feeling like my first rack
I-AM-SU

[Verse 1]
God damn, they let me in this bitch
Locked in, put my key in this bitch
No interview 'cause I'm the one who get the job done
No interludes on my tapes, give 'em straight run
Please tell me, where were you when I was dead broke?
They tried to kill my confidence, I kept my head low
I got my city on my back like a Jansport
You niggas couldn't catch my drift, ain't got the hands for it
Put the D up on her, now she can't score
I feel like Skateboard P up in the Bape store
Gave a fuck less so they hate more
3 tapes, 6 months, boy I gotta wait for it
6 speed, shot nothing but the net
Every time they see me, I get nothing but respect
This year I'm 'bout to elevate my lifestyle
'Bought the ice out, cut the lights off

[Hook]
Walk in a building, where the work at?
Walk in a building, where the work at?
Walk in a building, where the work at?
My last check feeling like my first rack
First rack feeling like my first rack
First rack feeling like my first rack
First rack feeling like my first rack
My last check feeling like my first rack

[Verse 2]
They say I'm getting out of character
I just cashed out on a submariner
All the niggas from before was embarrassments
So every moment spent with me you need to cherish it
I don't take detours, I'm too accurate
Sneak diss, I'll take a breath before I handle it
Cuz I know you be goin' off emotions
Got my gang with me I don't need no friends
Fishbowl on my Toyota, don't got no tints
Bounce out in front the club feelin' like the nig
Post a flyer on the 'gram, I'ma do it big
You try to tell me what it was I know what it is
6-speed, shot nothin' but the net
Since swaggin' I put nothing out but hits
Sleepin' on me that shit never made no sense
I'm a baller, what the fuck I look like comin' off the bench?

[Hook]
Walk in a building, where the work at?
Walk in a building, where the work at?
Walk in a building, where the work at?
My last check feeling like my first rack
First rack feeling like my first rack
First rack feeling like my first rack
First rack feeling like my first rack
My last check feeling like my first rack
