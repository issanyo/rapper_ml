[Intro: DJ Mustard]
Y'all already know who I am right
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Hook: IamSu!]
I know that I'm the nigga
Cause I hear it all the time
They say my head gettin' bigger
Yeah, I hear it all the time
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about this
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about this

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
No, you can't stop this
Uh, custom, you can't cop this
Yeah, pay attention to the detail
You a nerd, trying to hack a nigga email
And I'm going out of my mind, think I'm losing my conscience
I got bad hoes on my Johnson, shouts out Pink Dolphin, my sponsor
And I'm making love to the cake, people tellin' me "Get a room"
It's HBK gang bang, bang, bang like John Witherspoon
No money, it's tohdaloo, No Limit like Hootie Hoo
Disrespect me and my city, no tellin' what they a do
Cause I'm the biggest thing in my city since Chevron
Wakin' up the world cause the Bay is too slept on
Pull up to the club and I'm walkin' out with a freak
Gettin' money Monday to Sunday, you niggas weak
Player president, pay attention when niggas speak
Forever hearin' real, if you ever listen to me

[Hook: IamSu!]
I know that I'm the nigga
Cause I hear it all the time
They say my head gettin' bigger
Yeah, I hear it all the time
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about this
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about this

[Verse 2: AKAFrank]
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Unless you gonna tell me how to get rich
Makin' money like Mitch, pass hoes, give and go, I assist
The nigga, the nigga, I'm a star, she on my dick
Iced out, skydweller, I electrify it
Candyland, Candyland, got me heaven high
Next to I, your bitch'll probably wanna try
She think she classy, but she ratchet on the borderline
Your girlfriend a private eye, always spyin' on me
If she say I ain't fuck, then she lyin' on me
I only move for 10 and better, I ain't lyin' homie
And you can hear my bed lyin', when you ready for me
I'm always fuckin' bad bitches, feelin' like a heathen
If I want your main thing, I might trade her like treason
Now we even, a cold piece of work, I'm anemic
It's AKAFrank, hoe you see me, I know that I'm the nigga

[Hook: IamSu!]
I know that I'm the nigga
Cause I hear it all the time
They say my head gettin' bigger
Yeah, I hear it all the time
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about this
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about this

[Refrain: DJ Mustard]
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Cause nigga I'm the shit, your bitch knows I'm the shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Cause nigga I'm the shit, nigga knows I'm the shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Cause nigga I'm the shit, your bitch know I'm the shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Cause nigga I'm the shit, your bitch know I'm the shit, bitch

[Hook: IamSu!]
I know that I'm the nigga
Cause I hear it all the time
They say my head gettin' bigger
Yeah, I hear it all the time
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about this
Can't nobody tell me shit about shit
Can't nobody tell me shit about this
