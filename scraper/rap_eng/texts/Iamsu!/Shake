Look who jumped out the cage its the whopper
Imma put it on the grill, make it hot
Tryna put an end to us, tryna stop us
But its okay my whole team going to the top
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba, tell em watch the band play
Imma run them bands up, I've been on the campaign
I know them simple minded dudes don't entertain you
I had to step up on my cuffers on the claim you
You know you rocking with the best, baby right now
If you was up I know that drink would bring you right down
I'm about to build a club up in my crib
Do it big, bad girls you know what it is

Yeah, woo woo, Imma fuck around, put a jacuzzi in my room
Yeah, woo woo, Imma play the game but I don't listen to the rules
You can call Mr. Orville Redenbacher
If you put me on the stage Imma make it pop
You a nerd you get thrown up in the locker
Imma bully how I'm beating down the block
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba, I'm [?] bang, put your fucking hands up for the Heartbreak Gang
I'm about to build a club up in my crib
Do it big, bad girls you know what it is
