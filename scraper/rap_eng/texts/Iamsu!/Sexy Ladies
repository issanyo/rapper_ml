[Hook: IamSu! x2]
This is for all my sexy ladies
Dancing in your room
Barely a thing on
Please play this song oh oh

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
This is for all my sexy ladies, slowly putting on your make-up
Tryna get over yo break up
But let me help you get through it, through it oh
Never waiting in line, other girls hate cause you fine
Even though I can't have you I'm thinkin about making you mine
Talking all night on the phone, stay out all night cause you grown
Think about taking you home, thinking about makin you moan ooh

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I just wanna know what I can do
To end up next to you
Cause I love the way you move
And the freaky things you do
But never mind the BS and drama that comes with life
I know that you really want somebody to treat you right
Honestly I could be the one to be with you at night
But I know you ain't tryna hear, ain't no time for advice
This is for the ladies that don't need a man
I'm callin up yo phone like it's me again
And this is breakin news girl, CNN
Hopefully in my dreams ima see you in... in in

[Hook x2]

This is for all my sexy ladies
This is for all my sexy ladies
This is for all my sexy ladies
