Aye

Do you wanna ride with me
Do wanna go and get it?
I want you by my side, I just gotta know you with it
Do you want a broke man
Or one that's 'bout his business?
Tell me how you really feel
Tell me what the deal is
Cause I been looking for a wifey, the one to wear my white tee's
And chase dreams right beside me
Church on a sunday
She got style like runways
And she make her own money!
[?]
Tell me if that's you, cause I got a lot of love
And I'm trying give it to
Somebody that's gon be real
Somebody to hold me down
I need a girl that's gonna be loyal when I'm not around
Cause I could be out out of town for 2 or 3 months at a time
Ain't no distance great enough to come in between mine
If it's real then I know the love will keep us balanced (yeah)
By my Side Challenge, YBM,[?], wussup

Walk straight out my dream like there she is
How can I make you my chick?
I like you better by my side!
