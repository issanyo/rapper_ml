[Intro: P-Lo]
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah, ayy
P-Lo, time to get the bass goin'

[Chorus: P-Lo]
No, got no time to lay up
My bitch still fine, no makeup
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
No, got no time to lay up
My bitch still fine, no makeup
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
She gon' shake what her mama gave her

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
No, got no time to lay
She gon' give it to me right away
No makeup and she still fine
Bitin' on her lip when I'm inside
Woah, I think she the baddest
Woah, can't play her like Madden
From the wall to the window
So good, close my eyes when I get low
Like yeah, like the way you do it right there
Girl, I know you're not scared
Yeah, uh, you a pro at it
Make me wanna through my dough at it
Now bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit 'til you can't no more
Said twerk that monkey, let me see you get low
Freak that shit 'til your shit get sore

[Chorus: P-Lo]
No, got no time to lay up
My bitch still fine, no makeup
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
No, got no time to lay up
My bitch still fine, no makeup
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
She gon' shake what her mama gave her

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Yeah, yeah, she gon' shake what her mama gave her
Slim lil' waist, peach with the A cups
Ayy, I like 'em all, like 'em all, yeah
She like them rappers and ball players
If her last man play for the Raiders
Or the 9ers, I know where to find her
I got on designer, I'ma get behind her
Love the way she wind it, like she from the islands
Right back at it, it's been way too long
Time to make the whole world sing your song
Lurkin' on the 'gram 'cause I can't move on
So I post a picture fresher than a newborn
Count that cash 'til you can't no more
P-Lo on the beat, make your girl get low
Do it for me, baby, standin' on your tip toes
Do if for the squad, you know how the clique roll

[Chorus: P-Lo]
No, got no time to lay up
My bitch still fine, no makeup
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
No, got no time to lay up
My bitch still fine, no makeup
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
She gon' shake what her mama gave her

[Verse 3: Kool John]
Bitch, shake what your mama gave
My bitch so bad that she can't behave
I just fucked the bitch I wanted since the second grade
You can have anything but my last name
Your friends say I'm a dog, don't believe the rumors
I'm sippin' on a double cup that's dirty than a sewer
I be laughin' to the bank, got a sense of humor
10 thousand in my pocket, lookin' like a tumor
Slow motion for me, then speed it up
I rub my hands and lick my lips 'fore I eat it up
I'ma lay you down, throw them legs up
All the badies want a smile boy to beat it up
Put a hump in your back and shake your rump
Shit I ain't B2K but she let me bump
She told me, don't stop 'til I make her cum
She let me beat like headphones, I'ma make it thump

[Chorus: P-Lo]
No, got no time to lay up
My bitch still fine, no makeup
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
No, got no time to lay up
My bitch still fine, no makeup
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
She gon' shake what her mama gave her
