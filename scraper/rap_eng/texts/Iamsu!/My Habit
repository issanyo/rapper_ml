[Intro]
Hey I made this beat

[Hook: Kool John]
Money on my mind gotta have it
Ride around gettin' that's my habit
Smoking on this dope I'm a addict
Fucking bad bitches that's my habit, ay
That's my habit, that's my habit
That's my habit, that's my habit
Ride around gettin' that's my habit
Fucking bad bitches that's my habit
That's my habit

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
I don't know why these niggas rappin'
You ask me man in the streets I just went platinum
I cut her off and act like I don't know what happened
Four Fifteens got me whappin'
Put 'em on the big screen how they acting
Gotta count big cheese, I be stacking
Only want victories, I need dubs
I let my bitch kiss me in the club
I was OT, looking for the plug
Hit a 100k, licking 'em up
And when they bitch choose up, they don't like that
Focused on the money, can't get sidetracked, no

[Hook: Kool John]
Money on my mind gotta have it
Ride around gettin' that's my habit
Smoking on this dope I'm a addict
Fucking bad bitches that's my habit, ay
That's my habit, that's my habit
That's my habit, that's my habit
Ride around gettin' that's my habit
Fucking bad bitches that's my habit
That's my habit

[Verse 2: Aka Frank]
(woah aye aye, check it out aka)
I always count it up, that's automatic
Antennas up, when these niggas want static
You passed up, when it's all about the cabbage
Fucking it up, yeah a nigga doin' damage
I just stunt, I don't really do the bragging
Only listen to money, is what you ask me
Like when the coin flip, I wanna see the captain
Goin' bad on her pussy when I'm smashing
Say what happened, we got [?]
On this dope like an addict
And I'm with a bad bitch, they don't feel attractive
Late night in the studio, trapping
See when I pull up I got paper and plastic

[Hook: Kool John]
Money on my mind gotta have it
Ride around gettin' that's my habit
Smoking on this dope I'm a addict
Fucking bad bitches that's my habit, ay
That's my habit, that's my habit
That's my habit, that's my habit
Ride around gettin' that's my habit
Fucking bad bitches that's my habit
That's my habit

[Verse 3: Skipper]
Fucking with my niggas that's a habit
I be pulling all these bitches that's just macking
When you focused on the paper that's what happens
I ain't movin' but she say a nigga packing
Catch a flight for [?] to Atlanta
She know I'm a big deal, told her not to panic
Riding on the big wheel, smoking while in traffic
If it ain't a money play, I don't wanna hear it, yeah
Make her disappear, but not no magic
Had a nigga balling like a player for the magic
[?] ass fat, won't you let a nigga grab it
See you niggas try to buy that style, I'm really flattered, yeah

[Hook: Kool John]
Money on my mind gotta have it
Ride around gettin' that's my habit
Smoking on this dope I'm a addict
Fucking bad bitches that's my habit, ay
That's my habit, that's my habit
That's my habit, that's my habit
Ride around gettin' that's my habit
Fucking bad bitches that's my habit
That's my habit
