Eh, shawty you can come over
Baby come thru
And we can do it slow, just like how you like it
Shawty you can come over
Baby come thru
He ain't gotta know, he probably won't like it
And i just wanna take my time, (take my time)
Take my time (slow it down, slow it down)
And i just wanna take my time, (take my time)
Take my time (slow it down, slow it down)
(Ohhhh)
Shawty slow it down, shawty slow it down
(Ohhhh)
Shawty slow it down, shawty slow it down
(Ohhhh)
Shawty slow it down, shawty slow it down
(Ohhhh)

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
I just wanna take my time with it
Lay your assdown on that white linen
Go to church at that white Senate
Don't swim but i'll dive in it
I got you soaking
Imma need a boat when I'm in that ocean
Kissin' on your neck, got your eyes closed
Lay you down, let me hear you thru the side doors
Oh, let me show you what a player do
Turn your phone off, your unavailable
And i just wanna take my time
Fuck your ex ma, don't pay him no mind

[Hook]

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Ms Parker, Ms Parker
When you gonna let a nigga fuck, Ms Parker
Neva would a thought to crack an OG
She rub my back like Damn i'm  an athelete
You a work of art, Mozart, masterpiece
No living Master P
Dive in her like I'm Tre
Baby, me and you together, I don't see any other way
Get them lames up out your face
And tell them fools you need some space, uh
If you don't give it to me, imma tell you mine
Make you drop it low like a bassline
Your man the type to think that he can give place line
Shake your money maker
For a money maker

[Hook]
