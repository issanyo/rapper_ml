Man I can't lie I been running through these hoes
Play the background let my bitch roll-up the smoke
Aiming anything in my way, way, way, way, way
Man I can't lie I been running through these hoes

[Verse 1: J. Stalin]
[?] converted we got the whole floor
Bitches in every room, I'm knocking on every door
We do the same shit after every show
First I get some head then lil blood go
She brought a bottle and some weed to blow
We finna a make a movie called deep throat
We just need some ID make sure they legal
Shoot it in her mouth like a free throw

And when I catch my high, pull them panties down

[Verse 2: Rayven Justice]
Can't lie, I do run through these hoes everywhere that I go
