[Intro]
Calibaset
Calibase, you know you got that crazy shit bro
Always a slap everytime

[Verse 1]
Ya, yeah, yeah
Fresh on fleek, homie
Keep that glee on us
We don't break promise
If I say go, he on it
I got way too much pull
Niggas won't push up on us
93 octane, full tank cost 86 dollars
Then mixtape with problem
Afro made a million dollars
Bad hoe pull up on Collins
I live off the street from Collins
Ball like an open baller
Ballin' since CC college
Ballin' since CC college
In the burbs with street knowledge
Respect is a check is by any measure, we runnin' that check up
Big cheese on me, foreign keys, now I got leverage
Ice freeze on me, like a big gulp gotta keep my beverage
Call me D Rose, my feet little petals
[?] shows gotta check my schedule, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
He does it again, 6 speed wins
He does it again, 6 speed wins
He does it again, 6 speed wins
He does it again, 6 speed wins
And again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again, and again
He does it again, 6 speed wins
He does it again, 6 speed wins

[Verse 2]
Blow up the confetti when I do my dance
B-I-G, she want one more chance
VaporMax on, Stone Island on
I don't fuck with nobody from this point on
No I'm not sippin' on lean
G-Star on all of my jeans
I'm rocking vintage Supreme
Hop in the top with my queen
She wanna get with the team
Up in her standings that black and white panda exist when she slide through the streets
We don't got time to compete, yeah
You the type to bang for your ex back
You the type to bang for a text back
I'm the real shit, I'm the ex-lax
Got a new whip and it's jet black
Y-3 jacket on, I feel influential
With that microphone, I'm Chris Brown official
Super saiyan, yellow bone, pull up in a rental
All this shit is mental
All your shit is rented
Hold up, hold up, hold up, my ice cold as Nova Scotia
Hold up, hold up, hold up, she gon' ride like roller coaster
Yeah, yeah, ay

[Hook]
6 speed wins, he did it again
6 speed wins, he did it again
6 speed wins, he did it again
6 speed wins, he did it again
And again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again, and again
6 speed wins, he did it again
6 speed wins, he did it again
