Its a check

It ain't my fault
That I was born to ball
Now Im a legend in the mall
It ain't my fault
If I put you on game
And didn't bubble up for you the same
It ain't my fault
These hoes want my babies, o woah
These hoes want my babies
It ain't my fault

And thats a fact
The Ferragamo Falcon I was flying out of Sak's
You can be a zero and still keep it a hundred
Because that's a stack
So send me the paper through the phone
That's a fax

I been going crazy, can you handle hard
Those ain't pigtails baby, them is handle bars
I built this castle from the dirt
Just so I can go an put the gucci on shirt

Feeling like Im Danny Phantom Ive been going ghost
Ive been hanging with my nigga Pinch out here on the coast
It seems like my "doing" settings get stuck on the most
The Burberry Bank Robber in a blue strip coat

So hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gone finesse homie and tell my heart stop
Go ahead and envy me
Im the Joog MVP
And I ain't going no where
So don't try to hoe me

It ain't my fault
That I was born to ball
Now Im a legend in the mall
It ain't my fault
If I put you on game
And didn't bubble up for you the same
It ain't my fault
These hoes want my babies, o woah
These hoes want my babies
It ain't my fault

Aye
That you gotta back back lil nigga you don't know me like that
It ain't my fault
If you speaking to me wrong and nigga's come through in all black
It ain't my fault
Yo bitch gave it up fast, even though she didn't know me like that
She liked what she got so she came right back
And she's bringing me the cash, its just going like that

You know things come slow, you need patience
Can't help something's, you can't change some
I just go with the flow like a current
Get up on the beat and I turn into a furnace

It ain't my fault
That I was born to ball
Now Im a legend in the mall
It ain't my fault
If I put you on game
And didn't bubble up for you the same
It ain't my fault
These hoes want my babies, o woah
These hoes want my babies
It ain't my fault
