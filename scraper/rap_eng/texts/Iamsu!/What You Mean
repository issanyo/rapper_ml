[Intro: IamSu!]
June on the beat
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: IamSu!]
I got June on the beat, I got leather on my seat
Got it all off a bap, I don't ever get receipts
I ain't slept in 'bout a week, I got Gucci on my feet
Paranoid when I eat, see the boys when I dream
What you mean? (What you mean?)
Please tell me what you mean (Tell me what you mean, what you mean)
What you mean? (What you mean? What you mean?)
Please tell me what you mean (Tell me what you mean, tell me what you mean, yeah)

[Verse 1: D-Lo]
D-Lo, look
Marlo got a Glock with a beam, with like fifty on the feet
I be livin' what they dream like I fuck with Dr. King
TSA be on my ass, too much money in my jeans
Man, my nigga just died, I swear somebody gotta bleed
When I squeeze, I don't blink
We just do it, we don't think
Got it all off a bitch, I swear she gave me thirty G's
That nigga June, that's my bro, he's BPF for sure
I'm yellin' free that nigga Nickel, please let my dawg go
I got money on my mind, can't think about these hoes
Twelve hundred on my feet, don't be steppin' on my toes
What you mean? (What you mean?)
I spent a band on this lean, nigga
I'm a fiend, nigga, what you mean?

[Chorus: IamSu!]
I got June on the beat, I got leather on my seat
Got it all off a bap, I don't ever get receipts
I ain't slept in 'bout a week, I got Gucci on my feet
Paranoid when I eat, see the boys when I dream
What you mean? (What you mean?)
Please tell me what you mean (Tell me what you mean, what you mean)
What you mean? (What you mean? What you mean?)
Please tell me what you mean (Tell me what you mean, tell me what you mean, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Yee]
I got Louis on my feet, Balmain for my jeans
Off-White for my tee, with this G-23
Switchin' lanes in this V, do a hundred through the East
Fuck with my brother Sleep, you know Quali' what we drink
Diamonds water like a sink, in that water, you gon' sink
And we ain't throwin' Rafs, we the salt and the beef
It's your fault, play for keeps, got oop like a geek
This coupe AMG, this G thirty-piece
And my clip thirty-three, though
Come and shop with me, ho
Ayy what you on and what you need, though?
We servin' like the Green Door
Hi-Tech, Hi-Tech, don't fuck with green, though
My shit fly shit, what you mean, ho?

[Chorus: IamSu!]
I got June on the beat, I got leather on my seat
Got it all off a bap, I don't ever get receipts
I ain't slept in 'bout a week, I got Gucci on my feet
Paranoid when I eat, see the boys when I dream
What you mean? (What you mean?)
Please tell me what you mean (Tell me what you mean, what you mean)
What you mean? (What you mean? What you mean?)
Please tell me what you mean (Tell me what you mean, tell me what you mean, yeah)
