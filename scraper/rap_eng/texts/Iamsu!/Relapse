[Intro: Marc E. Bassy]
Aww yeah, aww yeah
I'm addict, I'm addicted to the way we
Aww yeah, aww yeah
Aww yeah Aww yeah

[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
I don't love her, I just think about her all the time
Fucking new ones, but she still the one that's on my mind
(on my mind, on my mind, on my mind)
O-o-o-on my mind, mind, my mind, mind (uh)
I don't need her, I don't even miss a fucking beat
Put the pedal to the metal when I'm in the street
On the way to hit a new one, somewhere off the ten
Then I steal your exit, might have to get off again

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm tryna hit it one more time
I'm addicted to the way we grind
It's some things we can rehash
What you got on my, what you got on my
What you got on my relapse
(What you got on my, what you got on my)
What you got on my relapse

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
I've been sober cause your body was my only drug
It gets boring poppin' bottles when I'm in the club
I like after hour functions
I like coming home and going stupid in the sun
'Bout to hit the move on, then you sending sexy pics
I'm pulling up baby, yeah can you handle this
I'm tired of being in rehab
I'm about to fall off that wagon with ya

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm tryna hit it one more time
I'm addicted to the way we grind
It's some things we can rehash
What you got on my, what you got on my
What you got on my relapse
(What you got on my, what you got on my)
What you got on my relapse

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Prolly chillin' with some women who don't understand
I make her cum, but she don't have to leave to come again
Win, that's all I do when I screw
It's just us, but I rather be her, me, and you
I pull up, she come down, we go up to her room
I'm like, "fuck, this is not what I'm trying to do"
I'm sick, your love is my prescription
I'm having relapses, my addiction is
You, and I need a lot of it
Riding high off it
Catching me flying on my rocketship
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
I'm tryna hit it one more time
I'm addicted to the way we grind
It's some things we can rehash
What you got on my, what you got on my
What you got on my relapse
(What you got on my, what you got on my)
What you got on my relapse
