[Hook: IamSu!]
Gucci man, I'm so icy
Gucci man, bitch I might be
No, I can't stand me a hypebeast
I'ma shake my dreads cause I'm hyphy
They gettin' striked like lightning
And I don't want it if it ain't exciting
And I only know real, no lying
Don't sell that bullshit, we ain't buying

[Verse 1: Kool John]
Everyday I'm smoking until I'm faded
Every track I hop on, I annihilate it
I got a new bitch cause my ex outdated
Bitch I'm smoking [?], og elevated
She wanna see these nuts, no dicks
Back in the day, I was pushing T's, no clips
It's only raw papers touching my lips
Dick so good, she wanna leave me a tip
Whisper in her ear, she getting quiet more
She got a leather jacket on like a bike boy
Like them if they got paper like a white boy
Got a smiley on my hat, I'm a Shmopboy

[Hook: IamSu!]
Gucci man, I'm so icy
Gucci man, bitch I might be
No, I can't stand me a hypebeast
I'ma shake my dreads cause I'm hyphy
They gettin' striked like lightning
And I don't want it if it ain't exciting
And I only know real, no lying
Don't sell that bullshit, we ain't buying

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I remember how I pull up trynna get a sex
I'm the nigga from her dreams, I'ma get her wet
When I pull up, man, they scream front to the back
I can't be in debt, I gotta get a check
Got the gang on deck, I'm hanging with my set
Spent like 50k on kicks, I cannot flex
When they see a nigga, they gon' take a picture
When we in the party, it's a flock of women
All these rappers fell off cause they not consistent
I'ma get a kitchen and a pot to piss in
HBK the type of group that go the distance
Take a shot of Henny then I'm back in rhythm

[Hook: IamSu!]
Gucci man, I'm so icy
