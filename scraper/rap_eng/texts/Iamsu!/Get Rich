[Verse: 1 RJ]
Huhh look
Niggas rap rich but I been broke
Last night I had a dream bout a kicked doe'
I used to cross state lines just to get dope
Wanna press my line gotta fish for it
I'm all alone in a crowd don't touch me, smoking I'm frustrated
Lie to my girl & she bring it up months later
Nah I ain't a ho i just crush a lot
Ball soft re rock til' I whip the watch
Mustard hit me from the yacht drunk laughing at chop
They said it's grind time a gang of niggas want yo spot
Look, a gang of these new niggas wanna be Pac
That's why a gang of these lil' niggas gone get shot
It's hard to grow up
Niggas ain't fucking with you so what
Sit yo ass down get ya dough up
I don't ever judge with my nose up
Ima blow uppppppp, Oooooh about money on that note
Bitch I'm 100 to the point you get taxed for it
If I ever need ya hand I'll ask for it, until then Ima be on my shit like

[Chorus]
Ooooooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you
And I'mma be richer than you, I'mma get rich like
Oooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you, and I'mma be richer than you, cuz I’m on my shit like..
Ooooooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you
And I'mma be richer than you, I'mma get rich like
Oooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you, and I'mma be richer than you, cuz I’m on my shit like..

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Ooooh Ooooh Ooh, I'ma be richer than you
Two or three bitches came through, I'm tryna fuck something
I told her back back it up for a Young G
Remember hoes used to call a nigga ugly
Two chains on mouth full of gold teeth
OG Chiefed up, try me n' get creased up
Couldn't make the cut even with a knife on
So bad had to hit it with the lights on
Body like a stallion, I'm finna take her home
She told me keep that shit a secret, just for me to know
She got an ass so fat I gotta hold that
I'ma throw this money on it no tax
You can quote that, sign sincerely yours
I swear I grind all the time make me need it more

[Chorus]
Ooooooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you
And I'mma be richer than you, I'mma get rich like
Oooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you, and I'mma be richer than you, cuz I’m on my shit like..
Ooooooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you
And I'mma be richer than you, I'mma get rich like
Oooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you, and I'mma be richer than you, cuz I’m on my shit like..

[Verse 3: Choice]
And we never going back so I know it's clear
Call the teller every night so I know it's there
Only find truth in your account and in your mirror
Counting checks cause I'm deaf nigga Kobe stare
Ooh the pussy so tight I had to claim her
Got yo deal on yo side fail call Kramer
Danger, Dying is cheap living ain't free
Niggas is cool but niggas ain't me
AP whippin' the jury til the court come
Get to the millions as a civilian gotta be worth something
I only like bitches who go and find bitches they all getting fined even when they find bitches
10 Summers like a motherfucking shy sentence
You ain't getting business girl stay out my business
Why would they sit and ignore calls from niggas
Don't call us back or broke richer than all y'all niggas it's Razor...

[Chorus]
Ooooooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you
And I'mma be richer than you, I'mma get rich like
Oooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you, and I'mma be richer than you, cuz I’m on my shit like..
Ooooooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you
And I'mma be richer than you, I'mma get rich like
Oooooohh ooohh ooh, I'mma get rich on you, and I'mma be richer than you, cuz I’m on my shit like..
