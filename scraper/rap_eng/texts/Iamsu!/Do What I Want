[Hook: IamSu!]

I said no, no these ain't your problems, these ain't your problems

Trying to get it on my own, yeah

I said no, no these ain't your problems, these ain't your problems

[Verse 1: K Camp]
99 problems but a bitch ain't one
You know they hold Diggy like my dad Rev Run
Tryna make the money flip like a old Samsung
And it ain't no fun unless the slums get some
Come all the way in Cali, yeah they say I got charisma
She giving me the cat, I'm on her face like some whiskers
Flash, flash, flash, I'm just posing for the pictures
Your man and you should be Clutch Derek Fisher
Now you're hanging with the big dogs, facts (skurr, skurr)
Cruising with the doors off, she head first on my lap

[Hook: IamSu!]
I know her man be worried bout her
I said no, no these ain't your problems, these ain't your problems

[Verse 2: RJ]
Don't you worry bout her, she gon' choose who she pay
I do what I do, she gon' do what I say oh
I swear I dick-matize hoes just to make 'em side hoes
Got a fetish for them bad guys, not a problem
She want a pusha cause your lame dry
She a vampire, never seen her daytime
Say she like it on the hood, I could bang mine on God
At the end of the day I could spend what you save
Playing in that ghost, got one foot in the grave
36 ways to get birds out the cage
Doing shit she embarrassed to say, but she cherish them days
You want her back, don't get sidetracked
I'm tatted on the back, that's where I'm at
The way I approach you can't coach
You sure she jump ship without a boat, I can tell her what I want

[Hook: IamSu!]

These ain't your problems
I said no, no these ain't your problems, these ain't your problems
I said no, no I said oh

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
I'm a Heartbreak monster, top notch pimping
Funny how I'm tall as hell but they shots still missing
I drive though dipping, I'm high as hell chilling
And since ain't nobody, I'ma go ahead and kill it
I'm tied to the rhythm, my soul in the beat
More shows and more seats, blow O's in a week
I'm a K-I-double L-E-R
Hit her with that stroke like a nigga bout to tee off
Rappers going broke, I don't ever wanna be y'all
Drop it to the floor like a motherfucking b-ball
We on CD Drive, man they asking for a recall
We are the gang, bout to blow up like C4, boom

[Hook: IamSu!]
