Dealer plates... real estate...
It's a process, you feel me?
Ya, ya
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Okay, woo, woo, woo
Okay, ya, ya, ya, ya

[Verse 1]
All the feng shui right in the function
Walk in the building, get it jumpin'
My girl got swag and plus she dumb thick
I'm bout that cash, fuck all that dumb shit
It's lit, I'm really feeling great
My whip got dealer plates
I'm buying real estate
My momma say I'm blessed
My granny lookin' down on me, she know that I'm the best
Got taco meat on chest, dont button shit when I get dressed
I let that shit show
Weird ass energy, let that shit go
Niggas might freestyle but ain't shit free ho
This that plug talk, what up Migos

[Bridge]
Yeah
And I think this the flow that they was mad at, yeah
I start all the trends, but don't get credit, yeah
Money on my brain, I gotta have that, yeah
Money on my brain, I need a medic, yeah
Brrrr, brrr, brrr, brr

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
Right back to the basics
Right back to the basics
Ten stacks for my bracelet
Ten stacks for my bracelet

[Verse 2]
I never let a groupie play me like I'm goofy
Gucci Gladiators on me goin' [?]
I just pressed the button and I'm goin' roofless
Knew this was a hit before I hit exclusive
Milly rock on stage watch them bitches go
40 on my neck, 30 for a show
So come and shop with me
It's Eyes on Me monopoly
HBK the team, I split the cream with my regime
Half a milly every Heartbreak Halloween
Stupid silly, Mainey, yadadamean
My pieces on denim sicker than some oil
I don't trust you niggas far as I can throw you

[Bridge]
Yeah
And I think this the flow that they was mad at, yeah
My portion will come in automatic, yeah
We gon' hit the club like where the bag at, yeah
It's money on the table we gon' grab that
Let's get it

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
Right back to the basics
Right back to the basics
Ten stacks for my bracelet
Ten stacks for my bracelet
