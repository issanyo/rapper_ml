[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Anti fuck nigga campaign
That's why fuck niggas can't hang
Niggas tryna switch up into my lane
Tryna ball but they picking up the wrong game
Wake up in the morning, I know 1 thing
All my bitches perky, they got tongue rings
Every 4 hours nigga chain cuffs
Open up for business if you can't close
Young nigga focused on the bank roll
We be tossin' bitches at the bank bro
And if you wanna play then it's game on
And I bet she had it ready 'fore I came home
Baby heartbreak same time
Only that real, nah I can't lie
When we hit the club, we don't wait lines
And you know it took a minute man, it take time, uh
Mane, we ain't, [?]
They can't tell you when to stop
See you know I got a heavy schedule rock star yeah
Heavy metal, need a rollie with the prezi benzel
No diamonds in, clean face
You ain't spendin' money, cheapskate
And the whole clique win a team string
Yeah we ain't winning for no cheapskate

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]
Anti fuck nigga campaign
Big ass rims be in two lanes
Nigga goin' so hard, I need 2 fame
Playin' hoes left and right, I'm a arcade
Niggas stickin' to the friends like a no name
And so much made me 2 Chainz
Went from walkin' to the mall like every day
To sit in first class on the UK
Talkin' take off, when you been gone
And niggas want beef, it's the same song
Tryna tell you we filet with the mignon
Bad bitches never play in the friend zone
They ain't lookin' [?]
And if she got a nigga, he ain't seeing her
She only want me for the his and hers
I bring a bag and I'm kissin' her
Yeah, when you on the grind, they can't tell you when to stop
I got your girlfriend smellin' textin' late
Like I wanna bang her, bang her, bitch nigga better call a girl a island
And this why they don't see us
Niggas got plug on the keyboard
M.O.B money my Tree boys
[?] young nigga I'm a d-boy
