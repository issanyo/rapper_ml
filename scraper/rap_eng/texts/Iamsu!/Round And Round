[Verse 1]
Throw that thing back and in the beat, I'mma catch it
Baby, waitress is just a blessing, just to be in her presence
Time is of essence, I ain't finna waste none
Wopity, wopity, drop it like you finna break something
All these 1's on the floor, it's only 8's on me
She like a red nose bully, bitch shake something
Round and round, she up the pole, now she slithering down
And she gon' ride it like a surfboard
The garbage belong to her, she work for it
Fill it out, you see her pose to right, move the left cheek
Instagram, flex game be on fleek
We don't go to sleep, we up counting dough
To the point a nigga head spinning round and round
Say we don't go to sleep, we up counting dough
To the point a nigga head spinning round and round

[Hook]
I wanna see you in your best outfit
Girl, gon' take it off, gon' do it like this
Ain't no way you move the bird thing
Never seen nobody do it damn, the way you do it like this
Round and round, round and round, round and round
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I sent that over to sweep that girl off her feet, yeah
And I'mma kill 'em as long as June on the beat, yeah
She love to play with my dreadlocks, yeah
Still I keep going when they say stop
Her booty go round and round, round and round
A heavy weight up in this game, I go pound for pound
With anybody, I mean anybody, we can line it up
You got a place in your heart for me, please sign me up
I would stay the night but you know time is tough
I gotta hop another flight to go and get the bucks
I like her in her gym pants, nothing underneath
I like to leave open air when we in the sheets
You and me, me and you, I could dig it
Dealing with big business and talking elite with it
Hardwood seats with it when we posting at the game
I bet I make you say my name, Sizzle baby

[Hook]
I wanna see you in your best outfit
Girl, gon' take it off, gon' do it like this
Ain't no way you move the bird thing
Never seen nobody do it damn, the way you do it like this
Round and round, round and round, round and round
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I ain't never met another woman
That make me feel the way you do
I ain't never met another woman
That make me feel just like you
Baby I just wanna lay with you
Them other niggas had your heart but all they do was play with you
Baby please believe me when I tell you that I'm stuck with you
I get butterflies in my stomach when I fuck with you
Ain't no pulling out, feel like heaven when I'm fucking you
Your baby daddy mad and he don't like me cause I'm fucking you
Then he give you one back, he just ask and I will do for you
Baby just ask and I will lose for you
Round and round, around, around, around
Round and round, around, around, around

[Hook]
I wanna see you in your best outfit
Girl, gon' take it off, gon' do it like this
Ain't no way you move the bird thing
Never seen nobody do it damn, the way you do it like this
Round and round, round and round, round and round
Oh yeah, yeah
