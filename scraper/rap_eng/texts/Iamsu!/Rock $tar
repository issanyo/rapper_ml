[Verse 1]
Cut some people off for the bread, I really did that
They say I was gone for a while, but now the kid back
I can't do no favors for y'all, cause niggas users
I like all my bitches with tans, like they from Cuba
Hundred thousand dollars, I blew that shit like a tuba
Trynna keep me stuck at the bottom, I had to move up
I can't stray away from the gang, cause it's a movement
Simple life of money and fame, what are you choosing
Often, we don't do this often
So please use some precaution
I pull up in that challenger, my whip look like it's barking
Like listen when I'm talking
And why you wear Pink Dolphin
I setting trends for niggas, independent niggas
With a major mindset
Hold up where the time went
I just bought my soul back
That was money well spent
Eyes on Me, the label
I'm just letting ink dry
Sleep on me and you gon' fuck around and catch some pink eye

[Hook]
I'm a rock star
I create my own rules
Label's CEO
I got that album coming soon
It's a dirty game
They won't ever show you how to move
So you gotta pick and choose
Ain't no time for switching crews

So I've been grinding every day
I've been grinding every day [x7]

[Verse 2]
I just woke up with the fucking rap game on my back
I just came up on some money, I don't know how to act
What is sunshine if you ain't gotta go through the rain
Do some crazy shit I hope I never go through again
Purple heart soldier, I got stripes now
On the hype, catching flights, that's the lifestyle
We'll see it for the come up, I feel it in my gut
I got a million dollar plan, a million ain't enough
6 speed in the left lane, can you see him
Drop [?] both of my chains, now I'm freezing
You ain't gotta wonder if it's real, no deceiving
Niggas in my city rocking shit for no reason
Gotta keep a cool head
Stay out of the news, man
Smoking, mixing two strands
I don't need no new friends
Came up out the bottom like a fucking ninja turtle
I could never ride an Audi, I ain't good with crossed circles

[Outro]
I'm a rock star
I create my own rules
Label's CEO
I got that album coming soon
It's a dirty game
They won't ever show you how to move
So you gotta pick and choose
Ain't no time for switching crews

So I've been grinding every day
I've been grinding every day [x7]
