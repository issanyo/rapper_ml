[Chorus: Rossi]
Baby, we can do it all weekend
Do it all night 'till the sun comes up
Pour up
Do it 'till the sun comes up
Baby, we can do it all weekend
Do it all night 'till the sun comes up
Pour up

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
You know I got cash baby
Spend money the fast way
And if it was up to me
You leaving and fuck with me
I love that you classic
Do it slow or in fast pace
We in the back of the club with her like so
Let me see you go to work, take no nights off
We still in this party
You don't know what you started
I can tell that you diggin' me
I'm feeling your freak pussy
'Cause from your head to your toes
Love is taking control
Girl, you got me in my mood
And I already know I gotta call up my bros
And say I'm goin' home alone tonight
'Cause lil' mama is cold as ice

[Chorus: Rossi]
Baby, we can do it all weekend
Do it all night 'till the sun comes up
Pour up
Do it 'till the sun come sup
Baby, we can do it all weekend
Do it all night 'till the sun comes up
Pour up
