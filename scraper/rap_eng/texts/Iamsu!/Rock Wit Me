[Intro: Trevor Jackson]
Already know that I'm on it
She's more than something special so...

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
Rock with me
Baby, tell me will you rock with me?
Oh, oh
Rock with me
‘Cause baby can't nobody rock like me
Woah

[Verse 1: Trevor Jackson]
I be checking for you long time
You look good under the strobe light
But even better in the sunlight
Windows down with the radio on

[Pre-Hook: Trevor Jackson]
Come ride
Tonight
Don't deny feelings you feel
Let's keep it trill
Baby tell me what's the deal
Girl it could be you and me, let’s ride
Yea it could be you and me, on fire

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
Rock with me
Baby, tell me will you rock with me?
Oh, oh
Rock with me
‘Cause baby can't nobody rock like me
Woah

[Verse 2: Trevor Jackson]
Tryna rock the boat baby hold tight
Girl we on the roll
Don't let this moment go
Tryna take you down like a low tide
It'll change your life baby

[Pre-Hook: Trevor Jackson]
So just ride
Tonight
Don't deny feelings you feel
Let's keep it trill
Baby tell me what's the deal
Girl it could be you and me, let’s ride
Yea it could be you and me, on fire baby

You pick them people apart
