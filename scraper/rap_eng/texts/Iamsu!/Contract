[Chorus]
First things first, girl tell me where your head's at
Are you a one night stand or a long term plan?
Girl, listen, I ain't even try to hear it
Here's the pen, let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Are you a one night stand or a long term plan?

[VERSE 1]
Big body with it back at the garage
Ari gold pull up with my entourage
Baby so bad, what you're waiting for?
Straight to the happy ending
We don't need massage
This a young rich anthem
Broke boys on my nerves can't stand them
Fly to every city motherfuck a tour bus
Feel fly as peter pan when i landed
Real bay shit I'm my own ghost writer
Niggas out here saying anything
And we don't cosign it
I been hustling, I been grinding, taking trips and switching climates
All my bitches bad as shit and I can't pick out who the finest
Hottest in the game how could you forget it
Shoutout all my bad girls with that uber credit
Come and swoop me from the tele baby
I'm in my motion I'm just floating see me levitating
Put some diamonds around the border don't call immigration
Flow dumb, space case like a fucking alien
Mc hammer, every beat I'm on I nail in haters
Haters watching like surveillance
Skipping levels like I'm famous

[Chorus]
First things first, girl tell me where your head's at
Are you a one night stand or a long term plan?
Girl, listen, I ain't even try to hear it
Here's the pen, let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Are you a one night stand or a long term plan?

[Verse 2]
Taking trips to the mall, Imma ball with her
Lip sync a nigga song with the dog filter
Little henny, little smoke got us off kilter
Zoolander, ex boyfriend you know I Ben Stiller
Where the bay at? Shoutouts to JayAnt
You know how we playing and homie I don't play that
Play this in the party all the freaks is coming out
Speakers blowing out, all the people dumbing out
The one they heard about, word of mouth all [?]
If it ain't money then keep yo mouth closed then
Sideline haters don't entertain those friends
I'm cooler than Altoids when we dipped in the wind

[Chorus]
First things first, girl tell me where your head's at
Are you a one night stand or a long term plan?
Girl, listen, I ain't even try to hear it
Here's the pen, let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Let me put you on a contract
Are you a one night stand or a long term plan?
