[Hook x2]
I don't see no stop signs
When I see green I go
When I see green I go
When I see green I go
When I see green I go
When I see green I go

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
When you first started out did you ever have a doubt?
Ever think that you would get this far?
Had a chance to go hard, to advance, be a star
Never talk with the strings in my heart
So it's heartfelt and you mean it
When it's all said and done you a genius
I'm the one, I'm the god, I'm the zenith
Just the eyes that we lie to survive are the faintest
There is a choice
Go ahead, figure out, new chain, bigger house
Kick you lame niggas out
Tell me what you wanna be
When it's all said and done
Wanna take over the world?
Give it all to your son
I feel like the one
Cause I am that nigga
When I did bet I made an impact quicker
Bottom to the top, it's a real transition
I'm out of here and they can't stop what they can't see
Bank real, you thank me
A fuck nigga that ain't me

[Hook x2]
I don't see no stop signs
When I see green I go
When I see green I go
When I see green I go
When I see green I go
When I see green I go

[Outro]
President, this generation turning their back with fear
The years of being lied to, having our dreams caged
Sky was never the limit
In a land where aiming high and shouting your dreams loud
Is when we're taken to exile
What happens to the kid that delivers on his vow?
The kid that see everything he confessed he'd be
The one who has been chosen
Who wear not just a city but an entire region on his shoulders
Sincerely yours
