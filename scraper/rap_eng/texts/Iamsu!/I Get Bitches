[Intro:]
I get bitches, I get bitches

[Verse 1:]
Me I get these bitches, I be getting chickens
Eatin pussy and I'm with it
Don't forget it, way before this rap shit
(I get bitches) everytime a nigga pull in front the club
(I get bitches) niggas bitches leave them quick to give me hug
Cause I've been about it, even back then when I was servin' trees
I was on her please, had the baddest bitches on their knees
(I get bitches) they wanna laugh like shake the big ol' booties
(I get bitches) I guarantee I had this dick up in your cutie

[Hook:]
Baby, I'm the one, nigga with the dope

[Verse 2:]
Wake up feeling so good, I may say it that I'm cold
Fat boy fresh, I'm swinging daily, your lady out of control
(I get bitches) who you know here out poppin on these hoes?
(I get bitches) look out the rich, I'm just like Rocky with these hoes
Haters screaming stop it, DOG is knocking
Sweety on this profit, but them pockets, all I check is flacking
I get bitches, who you know there selling out the shows?
I get bitches, look out the seats, I'm putting leather under hoes

Dare it in the club until the nigga bitch she suck it
Then I'm never tucking, freshest dress and fuck the stuffing

I get bitches, every time a nigga pull up on the scene
I get bitches, I be so bent that a nigga got to lean
And I ain't talking codaine, taking shots kobe like booya-booya

I get bitches, they gonna see it in a young nigga eye
I get bitches, my name tatted on your girlfriend tigh

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Get it cracking, ho, I been about that action steady
Mackin, mandingo packing young Jife and getting ratchet
I get bitches, that's for real, I never been down with the acting
I get bitches, leave a blank and fill it in with the capture
So she been the main attraction, know I be kind assassin
Asking me if I got bitches, better pick another question
I get bitches, cause it's sad, she wanted me to pass a thing
Inside of her the rattle shit and singing her like Madonna trick
I ain't gotta call, make her drop the drawers
Everytime we ball on this beats gots me shelling like a star
I get bitches, word it up, beat that pussy with a dope
I get bitches, I'm a star so she wanted it in raw
I'm a mac, telling shawty throw it back
Pussy falling in my lap while I'm pulling out the track
I get bitches, if I get it in the room is a round
I get bitches, get the bitch, let her fuck the whole track

[Hook:]
Baby, I'm the one, nigga with the dope
Fly fresh nigga that be coming with them hoes
I get bitches, every time you see me that's what I be doin
I get bitches, every time you see me that's what I be doin
I get bitches, please know that
