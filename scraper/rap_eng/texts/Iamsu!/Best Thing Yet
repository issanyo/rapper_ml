[Chrous from Anita Baker's ' Your The Best Thing Yet']
Best thing yet
To ever come into my life, life
Ohhh

[Verse: IamSu!]
Livin' under stars, tryna shine like them
Bumpin' the College Dropout, tryna rhyme like him
Bumpin' Aftermath shit, tryna rhyme like Em
Drinkin' until I'm bent like a duck bill brim
I wanna be the greatest, I don't know how to say this
But I would die before I'd be the one that didn't make it
Starin' in the mirror tryna find a deeper meaning
Of why I beat the sun, hung on morning and the evening
Cause I'm star gazin', tryna figure out how you got there
The top blare, Jay-Z, no Rockwell
But I keep a bad b with me
The same ones that starved with me finna eat with me
The same ones that came with me finna leave with me
It sounds simple but got complicated recently
Cause you take a lot of losses, tryna be a winner
Climbin' up the ladder of success with no splinters
It's hard but it's real
I'm from where people die just to live
So I give my whole heart in the real
Just to spark the young mind of a kid
To do it big like Frank White, swagged up, game tight
I just wanna shine and give all of ya'll the same light back
So when I'm on stage doing my thing
Apply that to your life man, hah

[Bridge]
Best thing yet
To ever come into my life, life

[Outro: Kool John]
Yeah
You already  know who it is
The one and only
Mis Shmoop Obama, David Huffer and Kool John
Living that Shmoop life, um
God works in mysterious ways
I always found the beauty in growth
Seeing the process of growing  nothing to something
Is truly amazing
God blessed me with a vision
To forsee things, I knew, you know
I knew, all I had to do was folow my intuection
And apply myself
And it would get me to where I wanna be
You know, It go a couple years back
You know what I'm saying
When Iamsu and I
We were going to the same GM college
He was giving me a ride to work
Cause I had car problems, And
I remember him  explaining to me that he did music
Um, so me being a music head lover and a music head
You know, I did my research and dug him up
Um, i instantly copped the rhyming
And came across some IamSu freestyles
I couldn't believe what I was hearing
I was like my young nigga out here
Really like tearing up tracks and shit
Like that, like, he better than any nigga out here right now
Major niggas, professional niggas and even undergound niggas
I was like, eh, eh man, I gotta heear more of this bro
I gotta here more, so i came
I became more interested
What you doing with this music shit
So he invited me to Chief House, you know
One of his buddies, he had a little studio
Set up in his bedroom
And I started coming over and hanging around
And listen to these original tracks,that IamSu was recording
And producing himself  and you know
He had  his other you know, his  fellow producers
Invasion Beats, P-Lo, Kuya and Chief, you know what I mean
I was just, like, crazy, like, like,woah
Like these guys are developing  a new sound
That I ain't never heard before
And, um, I even became more amazed, you know what I'm saying
The talent, that this young man, possessed, you know what I'm saying
Consistent quality, and the music he was making, you know what I'm saying
IAnd around that time I was throwing these parties across Shmop fest
I was throwing this little promotional company called Equippy Cool thing promotions
And wanted to climb the youth of promotional skills
Seeing something grow form the ground up
So, I'm listening to these IamSu tracks
And I'm just puzzled and baffled at the fact that
No, Nobody knwos at this time, the individual existed, you know what I'm saying
So, from then on
I was like, I'm gonna do whatever in my power to help this guy get started, you know what I'm saying
So, I got as many blank CD's  as I can
It was probably like 8 discs
I told him, I'm gonna get you in these streets
So, I make sure everyone I know, know about you, you know what I'm saying
So, so I know a lot of people and you know
A lot of people come and ask me, you know what I'm saying
Yo, you got any  more mixes?
Cause you make these dope party mixes
And these dope slow slow jam mixes
I started putting 'Su on the playlist
And they like , you know
And they wanted to start catching on
So, you know, And um
And from then on, this is one talented young man
This nigga can really rap, you know
You know what I'm saying
Who is this nigga?
You know what I'm saying
You know I wanted to convince everyone
You know what I'm saying
That he was the future
And I want them to see what I see
So, I see he future in this style
I see the future in his rap and his beats
You know what I'm saying
ANd everyone, you now
Like I thought they would catch on
You know what I'm saying
I'm seeing IamSu grow and transform  into the greatest artist
Each  project, you know what I'm saying
He getting better and better  and um
And it became motivating and inspiring
You know what I'm saying,you know what I'm saying
I literally seen, no one was fucking with him
To him being the man now,you know what I'm saying
And, um, I've seen him apply himself
And you know and ur
And watch him move and grow infront of my eyes
So that I knew I could do the same, you know what I'm saying
He kept his fans and teams loyal
And kept his fans tight
And all that shit, and ur
I was really happy to see a young man doing that for himself, you know what I'm saying
And to go after what he love and to take his music seriously
Now, you know
Now here we are, couple years later ,you know
IamSu's the hottest and the world is noticing his art
And all I can say is, I knew
You know what I'm saying, I knew
