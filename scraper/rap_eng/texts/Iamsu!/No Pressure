(Intro: Myiesha Lincoln)
Yeah, Yeah
Dream Team
HBK yeah you know how we play

(Verse 1: Myiesha Lincoln)
I'm cruisin' down the boulevard
Old school six four (?) yeah I know
Knew we shouldn't get involved
But the way we hitted off yeah I know
New in the moment I want you everyday
(?) i told you so
I know we could set this off

(Hook: Myiesha Lincoln)
I'm not tryna pressure you
Just can't stop thinking bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
I just wanna know, your name and maybe sometime
We could hook up, hang out, just chill

(Verse 2: Myiesha Lincoln)
Was that yo girl I hope she's handling her business
If not just call me I can show what real love is
Tell me, so can't you really prove it
Tell me, cause baby I can prove it
Come here, relax, lemme do it
(?)

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Myiesha Lincoln)
I want you in the worst way
Reminiscing how we met in the first place
I was just in the studio with on my first date
That was the icing on the cake where's my dessert plate?
Uh, and now I'm on cloud 9
Addicted to thinking about you and my down time
I mean I'm so infatuated with yo brown-eyes
How bout we take a ride with that sound bite

(Verse 4: Iamsu!)
Aye, Aye, Uh
Real talk, real talk
Imma be a player for life
My heart paying a price
And say you never meet real love twice
Thinking deep every word I'll write
I've been right around the country
Smokin', Drinkin', Livin', Thinking
Tryna figure out the real meaning
Alive, I can't die aggressive with my process
Seeing that you could be the new object
On my desire, killin' Michael Myers
Lookin' for that good good
Girl could you be my supplier
All this money I aquire, I'd admire, how you act
How you carry yo self when the people tryna act
Tryna find you where you at
I'm lookin' for you with a map
My head was in the clouds but you was sittin' on my lap
You even know we different you know I was just a track
Cause the other dudes was lyin', they the opposite of fact

(Hook)

(Outro)
Hang out just chill
Just be my baby
And let me be yo lady
