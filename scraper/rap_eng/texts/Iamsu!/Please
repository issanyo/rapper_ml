[Verse 1: Problem]
Yeah, high as a plane, feelin' so gnarly
Running this game, fuck niggas who tryna' guard me
Go against my gang, you better go get an army
I tell you pay attention but I know you can't afford me
What, call me problem when I fall through, yeah I keep it shorty comin' like I called Boo
Diamond Lane name ringing like a call do
Shout out to niggas, so you know I keep a ratchet on me
Fall through cheesed up bent like a macaroni
Broke note, not me, no?
Compton in my soul where it proud like a jacket on me
So where the bitches at I wanna fuck, the molly got me on two
You lib licking like you wanna suck, so you probably need to fall through

[Hook: Iamsu!]
Please, don't touch me cause I'm feelin' myself
I'm so hot that I fear for my health
They say calm down, naw it won't help
They say calm down, naw it won't
Please

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Yo' shit mute, my shit going deaf
Put me on your song, that shit is gon' melt, like an ant in a magnifier
Them jordans was just screamin at a nigga I had to buy 'em like do it!
Homie I'm passin' shit I'm the sewage
I'm always after the cash and run faster than Carl Lewis
I'm passionate y'all knew a way back, we was all foolish
She texted me the address and for sure I'mma fall through it
All fluid, flow rare, rappers don't wanna go next
Everybody know you're pussy minus the Kotex
Live and not progress, rippin' every show set
Beats bang, hear a nigga bass like a low jet
Flying never landing, I am the commander
Everything you touch down you should put your hands up
Grands up, when I hit the stage people stand up
For you the people sit down, AK flow I spit rounds

[Hook] (x2)
