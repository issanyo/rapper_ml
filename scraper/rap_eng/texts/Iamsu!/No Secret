[Hook]
(It ain't no secret)
I'm real, my city show love
I'm this, I'm that
I'm all of the above
(It's all that I know)
I'm high, I'm feeling myself for you
It ain't no secret
La lalala lalalala
Said it ain't no secret
La lalala lalalala
Said it ain't no secret

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting too long, been humble for a minute
The road to success, they say you stumble just to get it
I got the torch and I'm runnin' wid it
Cause them other niggas that had it ain't do nuttin' wid it
Came up from the riches but it ainâ€™t Virginia
Where you gotta watch the people that be hangin' with ya
Know that shit so well that I could paint a picture
Blindfolded and I know that I can stay consistent
Huh, cause fallin' off is a bitch
And I'mma work like fallin' off don't exist
Take a look at my click, heartbreakers, I've been babgin' it since
Takin' off on those who go against

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know women be the weather sippin' Ciroc or Mereta
Far as these rap niggas, you won't find noboy betta than me
Don't believe me? Take a flight here and see
I see the Forbes List like this where I need to be
I was a yungin on his grind, mind on money
Wit his side kick thirsty tryna aim young honeys
Now I aims to the top, neva change, neva stop
I was a good kid, never had to hang on the block
But the hood still cira-form, burb' still cira-form
Made it out the beggin', overcame less ?
But neva forgettin' where I came from
Came in the game with the gang, neva change, huh
