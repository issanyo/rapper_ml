(Hook: T. Carriér)

Aye, never been no hater
Aye, you gon thank me now or pay me later
Aye, don't make 'em like me no mo'
Man straight up (straight up, straight up)
Out of breath from all this paper chasin'
I got hoes on my dick, can't get 'em off
Bitch imma boss and these niggas hella soft
Paid my dues, you don't even know the cost
Took some L's but I still never loss

(Verse 1: T. Carriér)

Bitch I'm large
These niggas try too hard
Still in charge, might pull yo card
Tatts on my arm, I don't mean no harm
Don't carry no cash, put that on my card
Ain't no hatin' bone on my skeleton
Bout the benjamins or it's irrelevant
I got plenty businesses developing
You was hesistant, was out ya element
All this melanin I'm on they melon
Like a mothafucka but I'm still a gentleman
All the bitch made hatin' niggas
Don't make moves, that's pretty evident
Oh my gosh

(Hook: T. Carriér)

Aye, never been no hater
Aye, you gon thank me now or pay me later
Aye, don't make 'em like me no mo'
Man straight up (straight up, straight up)
Out of breath from all this paper chasin'
I got hoes on my dick, can't get 'em off
Bitch imma boss and these niggas hella soft
Paid my dues, you don't even know the cost
Took some L's but I still never loss

(Verse 2: Iamsu!)

I empty the clip
I smoke out the zip
I drink out the fifth
I plead the fifth, yea
Oh you wanna take my spot?
Well you real confident
How the fuck I'm gon flop, way too much experience
(Way too much yea)
How the fuck I'm gon flop, way too much experience
Big racks made off walk-thrus and appearances
Take care of both my parents
Lil' bitches talk like parrots
Grand hustle like Tip Harris
Fuck wit the gang get buried, yea

(Hook: T. Carriér)

Aye, never been no hater
Aye, you gon thank me now or pay me later

Man straight up (straight up, straight up)
Out of breath from all this paper chasin'
