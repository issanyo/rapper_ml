[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]
It's Philthy!
Look, me and Su run the same chicks
East Oakland to the Rich no look assist
Curry for the three in the clutch time
In high school you was eatin' free in the lunch line (broke nigga)
Your main bitch in my DM (is that right?)
She said she like the candy paint on my BM (foreign)
Single baby mother like Blacc Chyna (like Blacc Chyna)
Fuck her so good make her forget Tyga
Break your main bitch, Heart-Heartbreak Gang
She covered up the tattoo of her baby daddy name (lame nigga)
A hundred thousand large on my rockstars
I done come a long way from duckin' cop cars

[Verse 2: Iamsu]
Big Suwop got bops on deck
In the penthouse gettin' top to the neck
I'm just tryna make a little money, can you feel me?
She was fuckin' with me now she play for Team Philthy
Now she got the Heartbreak tatted on her
She ain't talkin' 'bout no money so I catted on her
Took her out her element, she hit the panic button
Renegade alert, my homies get it out her purse
All I do is live it then I put it in reverse
I be killin' everything, I needa buy a hearse
This shit is not rehearsed, it's realer than you know
We could fly wherever, baby
Where you tryna go?

[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]
It's a Porsche Panamera in my driveway
I told her "Bitch, it's my way or the highway"
Gold Forgiatos, can't afford to buy those
If I give you this dick, bitch, you hit the lotto
My Vegas bitch dancin' at Sapphire
And them ain’t diamonds, nigga them is sapphires
I been countin' all types of money
He lookin' like he been havin' fights with money
Spent a half of hundred on this watch, hoe
And you can join in, you ain't gotta watch, hoe
From East Oakland, California outta California
If I'm in it I could buy it, I don't do the loaners

[Hook: Iamsu]
