[Hook: IamSu!]
Oh when I get nervous
I’m in the drop top swerving
I took a chance took a risk
But it all worked out perfect
And my bitch look perfect
Cute face slim waist real curvy
Hey I’m up late night working
What can I say a young nigga ain't worried

[Verse 1: Bad Lucc, Problem]
Fat boy jerking, hoes lurking
Money make them change Im a whole other person
Diamond lane forever until they come and get me
Free the real ones T-C and Ducky
Diamond lane real shit you know my nigga lucky with me
My bank account say ain’t nobody fucking with me
But I ain't shit without my niggas though, my niggas though
Get on put my niggas on make my niggas grow
Come with food and advice anytime my niggas low
Give a bitch six to eight like I give her ten to four
Cause I’m betting on me (?) timeshare
Hit the supper with luck and with all dog share

[Hook: IamSu!]

[Verse 2: Problem]
Other girls I use to fuck now I don’t even touch them
Upgrade never backwards hundred rocks undercover
Pop them on the go moving as fast as a shuttle
One treat from the charger dodging patty’s and puddle
Facetiming with my sister tell my family I love them
Staying busy is the only way to stay out of trouble
Iam out in town making plays yeah making plays yeah
Pretty thing about to fuck you baby Lil Wayne here
It’s a game see what you want to see
I’m that nigga that ya’ll nigga want to be
You shining and trying to front on a G
Them haters keen been getting five hundred a peep
I put my niggas on like my niggas put me on
He say he bang but can never say who put him on
OMG what they do that at where my bullies at
Stevie J about the play about to kill the coolie cat

[Verse 3 : StoneyThaDealer]
And I just love to fuck man the hood crazy
Hoe around bowling over there call their favorite baby
Seen D with Trena they was leant up talking
Talking about when the next show cause they coming out
I’m like yea right cuz I’m know them niggers lying
But its still all love I threw the whip in reverse then I backed up
I took out the hood out from those niggers like I’ll be back cuz
I duck off in an ashtray then I lit the backwood
Studio session going down in north hollywood
Then I hit the windows then I hit the AC
Stopped on 85th that my nigga HD
And then my money just dropped from the stop the more
I bought us some henny I caught us some hoes
From nothing to something finesse my way on
And if you feel like I feel just help me sing along

[Outro]
Oh shit get hard but you gotta stay down under cover
You gotta stay down under cover
You almost there but you gotta stay down to come up
You gotta stay down to come up
