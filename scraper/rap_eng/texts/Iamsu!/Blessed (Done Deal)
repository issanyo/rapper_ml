[Chorus]
I am on, I am blessed
I drip when I dress
She sent a text, she wanna be next
So come chill baby, It's a done deal baby
Come chill baby (come chill baby), done deal baby
So come chill baby, It's a done deal baby
Come chill baby (come chill baby), done deal baby

[Verse]
Deal deal done fuckin with a real one
Came from nothing now we up
See me make a million
To my city it was rough had to make that income
Show em I was serious and make a real run
To the top, always on surveillance for the ops
I can't flop, press the motivation I can't stop on my block
Like a fire hydrant I clean box
Pull up in the 66 Chevelle with it knocking
Devil can't convince me I'm a fail, cause I'm not
Just somebody 50 bitter dips to the shmop
All she wanna do is shimmy ya shimmy ya
I be in my zone let me rock cause I got em
She wanna post at the trap all week it's no problem
When put on a show cause they watchin

[Chorus]
I am on, I am blessed
I drip when I dress
She sent a text, she wanna be next
So come chill baby, It's a done deal baby
Come chill baby, (come chill baby) done deal baby
So come chill baby, It's a done deal baby
Come chill baby, (come chill baby) done deal baby
