[Verse 1: Skipper]
Closer to my dreams, I forever chasing that  Goapale'
If I die today, bet they makin' that shit a holiday
Circle full of bosses, just look at the way we operate
School of Hard Knocks, bet I graduate with a doctorate
Bitches love the Gang
Got that Heartbreak all on their license plate
And honestly, I been had the talent, yall niggas kinda late
Umpire niggas, stay talkin' shit  from behind the plate
But trust, it never phased me, I'm focused on bigger moves to make
Removed the fake from round me, now
I'm rockin' with the realest niggas
HBK the gang and imma a rep the shit until I'm finished
Blow a couple bands up at the mall just cause a nigga winnin'
Plotted on this shit from the beginnin'
Now I'm hurtin' feelings
Said this shit before and now its lookin' like you niggas get it
Beatin' down your block, my windows up, but they ain't never tinted
Say you gettin' money, but your jewels are fake and cars are rented
All up in your girl mouth like a fucking dentist

[Hook]

[Verse 2: P-Lo & Iamsu ]
[P-Lo]
Money over here, no
Money over there
Your bitch gimme head in her underwear
Made couple stacks, blew it all today,(blew it all today)
Told you bitches up, yeah I called to play
[Iamsu]
Ridin' round town blowin on that strong
Bitches choosin up cause my money long
I don't love them hoes, I give 'em no time
Gotta bad bitch, playin' both sides, (both sides)
Stop talkin' 'bout yoself cause your man soft
Get a cup, buy some bottles, get your dance on
Gotta, lot of people open, that will fall off
Checkin',measure label meanings at the Waldorf
DJ, in my blue shorts, ballin, walla ballin'
And my skater  fallin' off, never thought about it
And this Pink dolphin, maybe, then I probably got it
With a Jamerson, turnt into a alcoholic

[Hook]
