[Hook]
Happiness is all I need in this life I lead
Nothing else has excited me
Girl I know you right for me
But it's the wrong time
You know that it's the wrong time
You know that it's the wrong time

[Verse 1]
Yeah you know that it's the wrong time
They used to laugh at me and tell me that my clothes tight
They would also say I talk white
But in the end it was alright
Now they wanna come on my side
But where was you, we at the club and I was outside
Where was you when I was down to my last dime
Where was you when I was tryna get my cash right
You knew it was the wrong time
My shows stay with a long line
She found out I was online
Then her man got the clothesline
Yeah she get up with her clothes lying
Rocco wear, Sean Jean
Saint Laurent cologne, Saint Laurent clothes on
Step my situation up cause life goes on
How you got your head out and they write no songs
Everyday I stand off cause I work so hard
And you know how I do
I belong to you

[Hook]
Happiness is all I need in this life I lead
Nothing else has excited me
Girl I know you right for me
But it's the wrong time
You know that it's the wrong time
You know that it's the wrong time

[Verse 2]
I wear my show, you play me
I gave my all, you made me
FaceTiming you and texting on the daily
That's enough to make a player go crazy
You look like [?]
Don't give a fuck [?]
You took my corner tried to play me like an arcade
But when I shoot nothing [?] but a bar play
It's better to go our way
A little love can go a long way
You played me down the wrong way
I vibing with the strong stay
Girl you know it was the wrong time
Set your clock back right
Activate my player ways and brought back life
Su, how can you say this when you not that guy
[?] hella dusty and was not that fly
Now I send a DM and I got that [?]
Cause you know how I do
I belong to you

[Hook]
Happiness is all I need in this life I lead
Nothing else has excited me
Girl I know you right for me
But it's the wrong time
You know that it's the wrong time
You know that it's the wrong time
