[Verse 1]
Uh, hardly home but I’m always on
Lift your problems and  call my phone
I’m balling out, these lames out here all stallling out
Niggas ain’t all about the money now
When honestly, it’s what this shit is all about
Up all night like a waffle house
All this shit that I’m dropping out, that I’m popping out
Her chest popping out
And her draws falling, I’m Jordan balling
I’m Phil Jackson, I’m play calling, quarterbacking
Won the mac like ?? her draws off
And that ho can’t keep her paws of ,uh

[Hook]
I’m too real you can check the difference,uh
And all my players chest is pimping
Ah, I ball out then collect the interest, yaeh
And if you real then you respect the sentence
Ball, farther, don’t worry carter, work smarter
I took the dam and go farther, I took the dam and go farther
Farther, don’t work harder, work smarter
I took the dam and go farther, I took the dam and go farther, yeah

Niggas know I’m next to blow, uh
Extra swagger, extra soul
Love women, no respect for hoes
Uh, the club is open but my sex is closed, yeah
Live my life cause nothing’s given
I wake up taking the me in vists
Was broke now everyday is Christmas, right
I’m from the Rich, where niggas hate to visit, uh
Uh, I’m at the door and they don’t say who is it
I’m with your ho, I gotta player with it,uh
I know I got it and I’m staying with it
Uh, I kick her out, she prolly laying with it, right
I’m at the car wash, prolly sprayin' with it, uh
Can no one do it how the baby did it, uh
This shit for us, there ain’t no hating with it,uh
The time is now, there ain’t no waiting with it,uh
