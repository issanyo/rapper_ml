[Chorus: IamSu!]
Young boy, out here on the block, tryna get it
Big bands on me and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Can you dig it?
I just wanna put my pride to the side but it's hard for me
I'm so happy I got God on my side 'cause he watchin' me
Young boy, out here on the block, tryna get it
Big bands on me and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
No stock on the semi
Tryna put my pride to the side but it's hard for me
I'm so happy I got God on my side 'cause he watchin' me

[Bridge: IamSu!]
And everywhere I go, I be on the old same old, same old, same old, same
Everywhere I go, I be on the old same old, same old, same old, same

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Young boy, out here on the block, tryna get it
Big bands on me and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Young boy, out here on the block, tryna get it
Big bands on me and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic

[Verse: Yatta]
Tried to put my pride to the side but it's hard for me, yeah
And when they killed my brother, swear to God, they took a part of me, yeah
Now everywhere I go I be on the old same old, same old, same old, same
Ain't no new niggas 'round me, just the same old, same old, same old gang
Young boy, I been on the block since a young boy
Is you drunk, boy? Ain't no ones, you get jumped, boy
Spray you, leave you stinkin' like a skunk, boy, slumped, boy
Chopper have you flippin' through the air like a stunt boy
I been on the block tryna get it
Shout out Mom Dukes, yeah she made every visit
Shit was sickenin', I seen your face at the sentence
You like how they give you all that time with no witness?
I know you can't feel my hugs or my kisses
Can you do me this favor and love me from a distance?
I fuck with you, shawty, 'cause you different
I fuck with you 'cause no bitch give me that feeling

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Young boy, out here on the block, tryna get it
Big bands on me and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Young boy, out here on the block, tryna get it
Big bands on me and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
