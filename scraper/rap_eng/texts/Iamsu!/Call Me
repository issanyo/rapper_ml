[Hook]
Pho-Phone steady going off
I wonder who it is now
Oh that's right it's your girlfriend
I guess that y'all just friends now
I told her she could call me, call me, call me
Call me when want a good time
I told her she could call me, call me, call me
Call me when want a good time

[Verse 1]
Your girl want it, I'ma give it to her
Front door service, I deliver to her
And I'm all up in her dreams, Freddy Kreuger
She gone be the target, I'ma be the shooter
I really got a thing for your girlfriend
And when you not around I hang witcha your girlfriend
I'ma dog I'ma dog I don't care man
In the bed, on the wall, anywhere man
She gone give me what I want all the time now
When we cut she play my songs in the background
I make her scream I make her moan I put my mack down
You off your job and I'm gonna give her what she lack now
And we talk all day and night
They call me SU exclamation and she say it right
Because she screaming and she fiending for it day and night
I got my player stripes before I learned to ride a bike

[Verse 2]
I got my camera, and stamina
I'ma cut your ass like a samurai
I'm no amateur, I'll damage ya
I'ma be-be-beat it till' you get enough
I'ma dog I'ma dog, yeah that's right
But you ain't gotta worry girl I swear I won't bite
I'm a ninja in the bed, a fool with the head
Yeah you heard what I said, I'm a fool with the head
Gi-Give her what she what, when she want it how she want it
I don't cheat it I mistreat it I just beat it until I own it
Take your man number and delete it out your phone
It's just a waste of space but you ain't gotta trip cause daddy's home
I got the game locked, he in the same spot
That he always was that nigga lame ha
I'll make your water splash on me ra-ra-rain drops
I'm get it get it get it no it can't stop

[Hook]

[Outro]
I said I really got a thing for your girlfriend
And when she not around I hang witcha girlfriend
I said I really got a thing for your girlfriend
And when she not around I hang witcha girlfriend
I hang witcha girlfriend
Ha-hang witcha girlfriend
