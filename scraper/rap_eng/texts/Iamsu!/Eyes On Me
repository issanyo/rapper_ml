[Hook: Rome Fortune]
I've been smoking
I've been drinking
A little paranoid so I might be holin'
Up all night like I'm sippin' on Folgers
I don't really care if the whole world notice
I got eyes on me, on me
I got eyes on me, on me
I got eyes on me, on me
I got eyes on me, on me

[Verse 1: Su!]
Lights on, lets rock
One night, on to the next stop
Sold out, turn up
Hot boy, every stage get burnt up
Shit crazy, now I'm solo
Everywhere I go I see the Heart Break logo
Hands up, make 'em swang
I just wanna do my thang
Make the whole world claim HBK

[Hook: Rome Fortune]

[Verse 2: Show Banga]
All eyes on me when I come through
I got your bitch and her friend, too
Shmop boy, hot boy, I got my city on
If it ain't about cake please just leave me 'lone
I called 'em I showed 'em
Went from local to global
Trick, I came from the struggle
My whole team from the bubble
Only trill in my huddle
And that's just how I keep it!
One of the nicest with this flow
And oh and I just speak it, eh?

[Verse 3: Dave Steezy]
They looking at me I'm not your 101
I come through, get high with you
Shut it down, let 'em know wassup
Converses 'bout women, tryin' to see where they be at
You know I put on for that area, the Bay we back
[?Stacking bread, receiving head, get money fastly
Switchin' up the style
"Where I get it?" Don't ask me
Pounds of the flavor
Man, these joints give me ash me
The cameras keep flashing, I think that I'ma dab me

[Hook: Rome Fortune]

[Verse 4:]
I'm the new kid, like some new threads
And [?] said with the "Who 'dat?"
And an ounce on my lip
Where's your camera
Not a fan of the starin', uh
Man, shoot the focus in your motherfucking lens
You die with my [?] right now, wow
At the round table with my nigga Su
We got them hoes tryna shoot a movie
That's a bit of Pow Wow
Anticipate the crown
Bow on my [?]

[Verse 5:]
Don't pretend that you lyrics are on the fence
WCW Title was really all [?]
[?], boy, all my caters are calling me Rick
Mailing and telling them that I'm supposed to whip
Different city, my zip code needed me more
3rd period doin' states, you told us you'd be on tour
Just notice that you been calling [?]
My life's been surround vision
My shooters just hit record

[Hook: Rome Fortune]

[Verse 6: Chris Miles]
I got eyes on me
Girl, that booty round like the iPhone 3
I don't really talk just to stay low-key
You know it's HBK the Gang, T3MG
I'm from the 631, that's my hometown
If you didn't know about me then, well you know it now
Young Danny Tanner at the venue got a Full House, wow
Tell the world that it's going down, Mr. Miles

[Verse 7:]
Word through the grape vine, on the break time
Get the brace out of a pussy, let me get it break down
And she dressin' like a [?], give a nigga shake down
Through smoked the Os up, all we got is [?] now
Bitch love it, niggas be like "man, I think she love me"
Get her with the flex, got her own 50 shades now
Listenin' to [?], get her fit, 50 made now
Schemin' 50 ways to get paid now
