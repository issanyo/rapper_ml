[Hook: Iamsu]
I'mma get back everything that they stole from us
Keep on eating even though I got a full stomach
Cross my gang, they beat your ass like you stole somethin'
Don't believe in L's, I just grow from 'em
Up and down at 5, I'm a road runner
Got my mojo back, I feel like Austin Powers
Feel like I'm back inside my bag, I'mma keep 'em coming
And way before I die, I'mma smell my flowers

[Bridge: Iamsu]
I don't got no diary to tell my problems
I say life's a bitch, my bro like tell me 'bout it
I need less Corollas, I need more Palomas
Everything on me dipped in water, I ain't drinking soda

[Verse 1: Iamsu]
I had to turn ones into fives
I had to turn fives into tens
Yeah I got [?] in the Benz
Since I ain't buddy-buddy with these other niggas, they won't cosign me again
I need the real love, need a friend
I'm making every shot I attempt
I'm off the gas, high as a blimp
I get a fresh cut, like a trim
I'm outer space, whole 'nother realm
I'm looking at the man in the mirror
I need to show 'em Oakland Colosseum
Big bucks, you could keep the whammy's
Run it up, plus feed the family, yeah

[Hook: Iamsu]
I'mma get back everything that they stole from us
Keep on eating even though I got a full stomach
Cross my gang, they beat your ass like you stole somethin'
Don't believe in L's, I just grow from 'em
Up and down at 5, I'm a road runner
Got my mojo back, I feel like Austin Powers
Feel like I'm back inside my bag, I'mma keep it coming
I don't wanna die, just to smell my flowers

[Verse 2: Doc Dolla]
I'm on 1 of 1, there ain't gon' be no sequel
Pinky finger up, I feel like Dr. Evil
You don't call my momma Sissy, you was not my people
You ain't been through what I been through, you was not my equal
Hold on, wait a minute
I'm in my zone, bro let me get 'em
Shot to the dome, no I ain't finished
Tryna, break a record like a Guinness
I need love, no [?]
More like a [?]
[?] in the trunk of a Beamer
Coolest monkey, I feel like Caesar, ooh
I'mma get back everything that they stole from us
I'm just coming from my crown [?], yeah
Something getting bigger, I don't feel hunger
180 to 360s [?]

[Hook: Iamsu]
I'mma get back everything that they stole from us
Keep on eating even though I got a full stomach
Cross my gang, they beat your ass like you stole somethin'
Don't believe in L's, I just grow from 'em
Up and down at 5, I'm a road runner
Got my mojo back, I feel like Austin Powers
Feel like I'm back inside my bag, I'mma keep it coming
I don't wanna die, just to smell my flowers
I'mma get back everything that they stole from us
Keep on eating even though I got a full stomach
Cross my gang, they beat your ass like you stole somethin'
Don't believe in L's, I just grow from 'em
Up and down at 5, I'm a road runner
Got my mojo back, I feel like Austin Powers
Feel like I'm back inside my bag, I'mma keep it coming
I don't wanna die, just to smell my flowers
