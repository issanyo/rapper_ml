[Intro]Trauma Tone

[Verse 1: Kool John]
Walk in this bitch, turn on, [got all eyes on me], Its all on me now, yeah, hey
Soon as I walk in this bitch, heads turn, I got all eyes on me
It's too many bitches, in this motherfucker here, and I'm taking some home with me. (With me)
My stepdaddy died, now I gotta man up, nigga now cause its all on me
Nigga came from the bottom, and I'm headed to the top and the kush, yeah its all on me

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Tell me what you want, what you really really want
From the rich, I'm the one, I'm the one to get it done
On my iPhone tryina get a play to get it [fex]
I get top off top ain't no waiting for that hash
Heartbreak, Shmoplife, team very very strong
And I pray that my dreads hang very very long
I be speaking from the heart when I say it in a song
How you claim you a boss when your momma pay your phone
I'mma take care of my family, I'mma put the team on
On the beach out in Miami all I see is Hoes and Thongs
Since my grandaddy died I'm the man of the house
I was 17 years old my momma tried to kick me out

I'm out here tryina setting an example
This niggers swagas snacking taking samples
Walking in and trying to see what we about
The topic of the conversation ain't gonna leave you out
Retro Jordans, you ain't buying these at foot locker
I feel like rocky in a meat locker
These niggas hating on the low and I really hope they keep talking
Mouth full of gold, I can't ever do no cheap talkin
Its bigger bidness, see the bigger picture
You want [?], tryina be official
You gon wait till you dead, wait for me to diss you
I'm fully focused on my bread, I really need my issue
