[Hook]
Tell me why you handcuffing, need to free that bitch
You niggas ain't balling, I could see that shit
Tell me why you handcuffing, need to free that bitch
You niggas ain't balling, I could see that shit
Tell me why you handcuffing, need to free that bitch

[Verse 1]
These niggas backwards
All about a buck, no need for distraction
It's easy as macking
Raised in the Rich, in the bay I'm a factor
These hoes be choosing
Yeah, I'm the number one selection
Uh, she the type to ride this dick just like a bike
I'm to the store cause Imma need some more protection
Aye, she was bad, black, and Asian
Keep me in a tight situation
And you know she just looking for a sponsor
She front row, taking snaps at my concert
Aye, I tell her put me on her story
Do a split on the dick, can you do it for me?
Wake up in the morning, get straight to the business
I ain't tripping off you hoes
You know I gotta keep it pimping

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She a model on the gram with a hundred likes
On the club tour, different city every night
You know me bro, I'ma bust her but I don't trust her
And if she ain't a dime then I can't touch her
My daddy was a mack, told me never get nervous
She might run her lips, but I still get lip service
She be buying heels and them big purses
But she ride the bus and she flip burgers
Bring your money up and leave you for the next nigga
You be going raw when you having sex with her
I be going hard, hands 'round her neck with it
All about her money, you know I respect business
Tryna give her ass an inch, she gon' take a mile
I'ma take her to hotel and take her down
Niggas hating on the low, they need to say it now
Guarantee that when you go, your girl will stay around

[Hook 2x]
