Verse 01: DrAssenator
Focus On The Grind, Got me wakin' up all night
Life in the getto, make you wanna spit rhymes like traito (traitor)
Niggas cold & society is heartless and I'm hurt-less
On the mic i flex, nothing less, i drop rhyme bomb like flex in Vietnam
Cause my home is like Vietnam, face desert storms
Chemicals wars- face like i feeling like i'm feeling cold war
Dead bodies on the roads, people watch'em
But don't they don't help'em anyway, *laughs*
So i hit the studio, steppin' in like its my last time
I fight rhyme, i do rhyme (Rap) that's not just music, its my life
Flowin' thru my nightmarish mouth, flow reaches height and explode like a missel
D for real, I rap for real
I turn my passion into my pager, write rhymes that'd get me some pay
And help you people survive through hardtimes, when you bout' to lose your home
And you don't have a single buck to pay and you mother's crying
That's the reason,i don;t buddy buddy with rappers cause i know that shit is a fake
Most of ya niggas fucked up my mathematics grade
Cause everything a track's done i hear voices (hollering) in my head
I-am-your-lack-of-conscience, me against me, fuck the free world
I need a reverie, prevent your daughters from hearing my tracks
Cause i already got load of you women, and they all wishin' they can blow what i'm grippin' daaaamn
So many ladies wanna share my tongue, huh
I got no time to fuck around, i focus on my money, i'm tryna settle down

[Hook/Chorus:RaayShil]
Cold Society (X4)
