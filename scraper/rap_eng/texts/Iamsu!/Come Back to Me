[Intro: Iamsu}
Yeah
Oh, and I never met a girl like you
Never met a girl like you
And I never met a girl like you

[Verse 1: Iamsu]
I thought we was the perfect pair
Now when I look into your eyes I see an empty stare
Remember when, we we're best friends
And now you're gone, my mind's filled with questions
Said the distance was an issue, I understand the reason
My commitment was official, you know I'm never leavin'
I just wanna see you happy, meant it when I said it
But now I'm facing reality, I really regret it
Cause I don't want nobody else to have you
Uh, I should of kept you when I had you
But now I'm forced to hear the bad news
I'ma always be here like a tattoo
Yeah, my nigga for life
And I hope your new man is treatin' you right
Just the thought of you leaving makes my stomach turn
But I guess I gotta let it burn, suzy

[Hook: Iamsu]
And I don't know if I can do it
And I don't know if I can do it
And I don't know if I can do it
I don't know if I can do it

[Verse 2: Iamsu]
You never know what you have until it's gone
And when you used to being right it's hard accepting being wrong
All the thing's I said in songs, words I never meant
Long nights in the studio that would be much better spent with you
I try to hide it, try to fight it, but I can't
So when thought to write it down I took my time
So I could paint the perfect picture with my words and try my best to make it clear
Thinkin' about you leaving when I'd rather have you here
I fought tears when I wrote this rap
I thought I locked my pain away but now it all came back
Reminiscing, wishin' I could have that whole thing back
But all the wishin' in the world still won't change facts
I put my heart in my songs, hope you feel my pain
Hope you would feel my thoughts, Hope your opinions would change
I'm just a boy lost in the world, tryina find his way
So I guess this what I'm tryina say, Su

[Hook: Iamsu]

[Outro: Iamsu]
Oh, and I never met a girl like you
Never met a girl like you
And I never met a girl like you
