[Chorus: 1-O.A.K.]
I'm staring at the bottom of my cup now
I can't really tell who I love now
I'm just tryna score, like a touchdown
Feeling like I don't give a fuck now
No, no, I just don't give a fuck now
Feel like turnin' up now

[Verse 1: 1-O.A.K.]
Feel like I had one too many
Two too many, maybe a few too many
Girl, what's up? You fine as fuck
Let's cut you with it
I can tell by the look in your eye
Don't front, you fuckin' with it
I’m not parked too far outside
Text whoever you're with, just tell 'em you got a ride
Baby, don't fight the feeling, tonight just go with the vibe
Maybe I shouldn't drive, let's get Uber and slide
Bout to close up my tab, give my homies dap
She do the same thing
I'm like: "Damn, who is that?"
Your partner’s kind of bad
Tell me what's your girl name
Now don't overreact, you can't get mad
'Cause you not my main thing
So I’ma get y’all to the pad , Y'all gon' throw it back
Pop it just like champagne

[Chorus: 1-O.A.K.]
I'm staring at the bottom of my cup now
I can't really tell who I love now
I'm just tryna score like a touchdown
Feeling like I don't give a fuck now
No, no, I just don't give a fuck now
Feel like turnin' up now

[Bridge: IamSu!]
Damn, I'm lit
Bitch, I'm the shit
I'm with my niggas
Now, where them bitches?
Damn, look at her
She lookin' fine
Let me see what's up?
Woah, never mind, hey
Damn, I'm lit
Bitch, I'm the shit
I'm with my niggas
Now, where them bitches?
Damn, look at her
She lookin' fine
Let me see what's up?
Woah, never mind, hey

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
What’s up baby, what’s your name?
Drink this liquor, numb the pain
Make you come and come again
Keep that money runnin' in
Cuban link, my necklace
Cuban link, my neck and wrist
I respect my women, baby
But I can’t respect a bitch
When you living in the Bay
Really do the shit you say
If you acting different
We reactin' in a different way
I just keep it pimpin’, mane
Cali Boy, ain’t trippin’ mane
All I know is HBK
And I can’t rep a different game
Different bullshit, different day
Road trips and Chick-Fil-A
I just need a home cooked meal
A pillow where my head can lay
Vegas at the Mandalay
Oops, I mean the Mandarin
She just got a text from me
Cancelled all her plans with him
Really I’m the feature film
Really you just standing in
Call me I ain’t answerin’
I smoke, pull up my pants and dip
Hold up, wait before I forget
Can’t forget, I’m way too lit
I been on my Henny trip
I think I need a sponsorship

[Chorus: 1-O.A.K.]
I'm staring at the bottom of my cup now
I can't really tell who I love now
I'm just tryna score like a touchdown
Feeling like I don't give a fuck now
No, no, I just don't give a fuck now
Feel like turnin' up now

[Bridge: IamSu!]
Damn, I'm lit
Bitch, I'm the shit
I'm with my niggas
Now, where them bitches?
Damn, look at her
She lookin' fine
Let me see what's up?
Woah, never mind, hey
Damn, I'm lit
Bitch, I'm the shit
I'm with my niggas
Now, where them bitches?
Damn, look at her
She lookin' fine
Let me see what's up?
Woah, never mind, hey

[Outro: 1-O.A.K.]
Damn, I'm lit
Look at her, woooah
