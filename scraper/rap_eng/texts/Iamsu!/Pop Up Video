[Intro]
We keep racks on all of us
You got swag but it's not enough
Poppin' tags on 'em just because
I'm the shit and I know it
Oh, yeah

[Hook]
Big racks all on us
Big racks all on us
And you can't ride my bus
I hop out front SunTrust
It's not too many I trust
So I don't share that much
And I don't care that much
She ride night gears at the club

[Verse 1]
Big nigga with some racks
Gold y'all wallet Gucci bag
He not like me so he sad
Cut a little weight, he throw it back

[Pre-Hook]
We keep racks on all of us
You got swag but its not enough
Poppin' tags on 'em just because
I'm the shit and I know it
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm living rockstar status
I'm mixing drink, off balance
I'm taking on every challenge
In a hellcat package
Bey racks on us
In God we trust, in God we trust
They can't keep up
Got swag but it's not enough
Pop tags on 'em just because
It's not enough
On 'em just because
Pop tags on 'em just because
Got swag but it's not enough
Pop, ah-ha
