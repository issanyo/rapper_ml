[Verse 1: Rossi]
It's around three
And I ain't tryna leave out of here tonight
Unless you with me
I know you wanna leave your women behind
All I know is your body's calling me, baby
Your ass is feeling amazing
Can you ride it like a Mercedes?

[Pre-Hook: Rossi]
No holding back, holding back
I wanna see you throw it back, throw it back
Or can you just put it, put it on me?
I'll be all night baby, I'll be all night baby

[Hook 2x: Rossi]
All I, all I want
Is my hands touching on your body
All I, all I, all I want
And we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Verse 2: Rossi]
If I see it and I want it
She will get it more than two times
She'll be all up in her feelings
If she get it more than three times
And I be gone in a minute
Don't be running like gimmick
If you don't know what I do
I'ma put it down on you

[Pre-Hook + Hook(2x)]

[Verse 3: IAMSU!]
I just wanna touch, I just wanna hold
Am I doing too much? Baby, let me know
First I'ma get it wet, put you on a Southwest
Show you 'round the whole bay
Smoke something, clear your head
Introduce you to the squad, in the bed I do my job
Take you down to Hollywood, [?] boulevard
I wanna know what you like, what you into
Talk kinda slick, I got game like a pimp do
Dance on me baby, show me how you get down
Show me how you move in the crib when nobody 'round
You be on your own hype and I like that
And every time I catch it, baby throw it right back

[Hook 2x: Rossi]

[Outro: Rossi]
Hbk, yeah you know how we play
And I can't quit all I know is gang shit
