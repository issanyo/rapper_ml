Uh, doing me consistently, making history
Head up pay street and I ball, mr clean
Listening to ya'll but I ain't hearing nothing
I guess I make my competition fall like a pumpkin,
Tailer made swag, I made the adjustments
They wait for my return like after tax deductions
You say a bunch of nothing, I just say what I feel like
Life in how I deal, like lightning how I kill,
On sight when I appear, like magic
Then I do it major like RIP to static
Ben Frank addict, I donâ€™t got no tats bitch
But if I did, then I promise I would tat this
It would be two eyes on the back of my head to see you snakes
And I promise that I'm stacking my bread I'm getting cake
I ain't even ball the house, but a man on realest state
So I'm quick to spot the phony on frod, on fake
Huh, huh!

I just keep on
Ah!

Ah, I pull up like toddler dipers
Raining on you niggas like windshield Wipers
DC sniper, I point the molly..
I got a lot of babes to hand to make a lot of bread
Vintage Ralph Lauren shit, Jordan six, boy I'm sick
No, there ain't no cure in this, I'll be always tourin' bitch
Pink dolphin mannequin, sky walker anikan
Got white girl like Jennifer Aniston
Quick to make these rappers look stupid
Got their girlfriend walking naked like a nudist
But she know it's heartbreak game, no give a side the jam go
She promise I'll keep it quiet, like Padman
Hide inside with no accent, crazy, ..give me back in
Stack that she's hangeli, but the fans love me
But the stans hate me, mad cause they ain't me
