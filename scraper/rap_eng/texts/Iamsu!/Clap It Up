And they already know me, S-A-G-E

[Hook: jaynfresh]
Bravo, lemme' get a encore
Now bring that ass back like it not yours
Girl yeah I ball, bring a round for my dogs
And make sure that ass give a round of applause
Clap it up (4x)
Make that ass shake (2x)
Drop it drop it to the floor make that ass shake

[Verse 1: Fresh]
Okay lemme' see you drop it, bust it open
Goin' stupid on that ass call that east oakland (ha!)
To Vallejo, hit it like they say go
I ain't Jewish but im spendin' money like a dreidel
That chick know my name? Bet she know it bro
But she can't call me fresh, call me go-deep ho
In a Beemer, smokin’ on that Keisha
Bust a levy on the pussy get it soakin like Katrina splash
Whoa now, baby slow down
Bottles up its ‘bout to go down, call that Motown ho
Now drop it like Geronimo baby im tired of waitin’
Drop that ass like a standing ovation what that shit do?

[Hook]

[verse 2: Jay]
Bring that ass back, like its not yours
Clap it up girl yeah like an encore
Bangin’ from the back have her on all fours
Exotic chick every night like im on tour
Young and tatted all the girls be like “what for”
Whoa I mean this is what I do though
Snatch a nigga bitch act a dog in the pussy
You can call a nigga cool joe, with a thick Mexican
She call me papi chulo
And I be kingin’ (2x)
Gold rings, gold chains
Step up in the building all these hoes get to screaming
Give her dope dick now this ho out here feignin’

[Hook]

[verse 3: sage the Gemini]
Uh, and they already know me S-A-G-E
Uh, Back it up like the R on a transmission

Bitches lookin like they wanna kiss it
All my bitches know each other I don’t need a mistress
Yeap, ew im in this bitch like sperm cells
Yo bitch ain't suck you like she suck me but she learn well
She got that ocean, im a sperm whale
Handcuff her make her work until she earn bail

[verse 4: Iamsu & Armani Depaul]
Don’t be modest you know you got my attention
My hands itching you money im sayin girl you the business (suzi)
Im prayin that you can witness my appeal, I am real
And im solid like a motherfuckin iron pill
Eyes twitchin, read you baby you non fiction
Don’t want no drama be honest im tryna vibe with you
Get a vibe from you, show some affection right
And I’ll be patient, wait it hit it on the second night, Armani
