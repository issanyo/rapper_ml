[INTRO]
Uh, Yeah
Uh, Yeah, Yeah

[IamSu!]
I don't see no rappers ahead of me
Help you step up your pedigree and get some better beats, uh
My dogs are untamable, forget a leash
You been free, but your still trapped mentally
Eyes in the scope looking at my enemies
Singlehandedly got em scared like there's 10 of me
HBK we a different breed, so sucker free
Maintain to keep our name clean, luckily
Only the real, are those who fuck with me
[?] suckers and get the cheese, uh
I solemnly swear, to get the money
And if you want it you can follow me there, yeah
Heart breakers are law makers so follow rules
A phone call will turn you haters to molecules
Rich city gained me, can nobody frame me
Navigated through this business still remained the same me
If I'm good then we all good, uh
Stay loyal, I'm from a small hood
But then I moved to the burbs and I kept it realer than most
Not saying I deserve a major deal but I feel that I'm close
But fuck a major deal cause these niggas sign us to broke
Cause letting a nigga make your decisions is a joke, uh
And I'm not laughing, its been a drought since Pac's passing
It's blasphemes to do a song without spazzing
All these rappers is fly by nights I will out last them
I'm a Hummer to a Prius, I will out gas them
Intellectual mobbing, you have just met a problem
And I'm high as extraterrestrial vessels when flying
Got realness in my blood vessels, invest in my diet
I'm listening to these old heads they should think bout retiring
Retire for a higher being like myself to shine
Ballin' like an NBA live player customized
Everything 99, including my Jordan's
If I'm not buying sneakers I'm abusing recordings
If I'm not blowing speakers out, I'm thinking about
How to make a million the secret route
These loud mouth niggas don't got nothing to speak about
All these niggas phony best believe I could peep it out, uh
Suzy nigga
