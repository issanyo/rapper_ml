[Intro]
Hey, I made this beat
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Hook]
Woah. What you want?
The money or the fame, tell me what you need girl
You just wanna kick it cause the weed good
You just wanna kick it cause we feel good

I ain't trippin' bout these hoes
Yall niggas talkin' bout me, Young nigga made a hunnid thousand dollars off the flow
I ain't trippin' let me know

What you want?
The money or the fame, tell me what you need girl
You just wanna kick it cause the weed good
You just wanna kick it cause we feel good

I ain't trippin' bout these hoes
Yall niggas talking bout me, young nigga made a hunnid thousand dollars off the flow
Baby tell me what you want

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Tell me what you want
Them sold out shows with the racked up extras?
Tell me what you want
Straight to the gym in the mornin' cause I'm flexed up
Tell me what you want
They stole a nigga swag, hit em with the unexpected
Tell me what you want
In the Bay, Im a legend you know they respect it

Takin' trips up in my A
Imma take her to the Bay
Imma make her my new Bae
Got her banging HBK

Shawty thicker than a Snicker
Every time I lick her
She be down to marry me
Multiple bitches be sharin' me
Cause Im that nigga appearently

Sometimes we do this for charity
Put this beat in physical therapy
I think i drank too much liquor
Imma need someone to carry me

[Hook]

Verse 2: Dave Steezy]
Yeah, I be with the day ones
None of it is made up
Kick game on look at how a nigga laced up
Need it up front
I dont ever want a pay cut
She chose me I ain't even had to say much

Right now I'm on tour with Young Su
Pull up on her wet when I swoop
In the game I ball so hard like I hoop
Found out she was a freak but I knew

From the jump and its finna get lit
She lookin' like the lick, think Imma go hit
Comin' from the B, I fuck with niggas from the rich
And I like that pack, know i like to keep it lit

Yeah, and you know what I mean
Stoner in here I be rolling up weed
1 to 1 swag, boy I come through clean
Skating through and they know what I mean

[Hook]
