I got it, you need it
I know you know who my team is
I'm always up in some clean shit
I'm outer space and you descend
My city know that I'm on
Yo' baby all in my phone
You better pray I don't call her back
Because she may never come home

She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she Know
She know, she know, she Know
She know

[Verse 1]
It's that
Young G
Come through
Bug out
Show her
Take her
On tour
Change her
Whole world
I think
I know
Why these niggas hate me
I think
They mad
Just cause
I'm ballin' baby
I'm wildin' out
Hit the mall we're crazy
I'm stylin' out
When them niggas talkin' baby
I'm the one that they talkin' 'bout
All my niggas with me
You can't get through you gotta walk around

Ay

[Hook]
I got it, you need it
I know you know who my team is
I'm always up in some clean shit
I'm outer space and you descend
My city know that I'm on
Yo' baby all in my phone
You better pray I don't call her back
Because she may never come home

She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she Know
She know, she know, she Know
She know

[Verse 2]
Poppin' bottles
She pop the top
As far as Jordans I cop a lot
All my women take Model shots
And all yo' bitches get cropped a lot
Reppin' hard I'm puttin' on
Pink dolphin I'm puttin' on
Gas pedal my foot is on
I'm always in my fuckin' zone
I'm ballin' baby
I'm wildin' out
All black truck
Girls fallin' out
My swervin' tight
No fallin' out
I'll gas on her
You stallin' out

[Hook]
I got it, you need it
I know you know who my team is
I'm always up in some clean shit
I'm outer space and you descend
My city know that I'm on
Yo' baby all in my phone
You better pray I don't call her back
Because she may never come home

She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she know
She know, she know, she Know
She know, she know, she Know
She know
