[Hook: Mayuex]
I'mma king like James, ay
I want rings like Way, ay
Bout to spread my wings, fly away, ay
House in the hills where she stay, ay, oh
I want rings like Way, ay
She know I'mma king like James, ay
Bad bitch in the hills where she stay, ay
You know I ain't come here to play, ay

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
Ay, I got rings like MJ
20 thousand for a show, you know they pay
Drop bombs on your hoe, and it's Mayday
Every track man I go, I go insane
I from the Rich, trip and she get scraped
About chips, I'm in love with the Ben Frank
Balenciaga, Triple S, see the kick game
I'm on a plane every week, watch me switch states
And I just bought one [?] town
Imma run up in your crib, it's a shake down
Money going up, since [?]
She choose up, she just needed one chance
I could count 60k with one hand
Five bitches, but I'm only one man
We gon' tell you niggas, read about it
Need my backend quick, I won't leave without it

[Hook: Mayuex]
I'mma king like James, ay
I want rings like Way, ay
Bout to spread my wings, fly away, ay
House in the hills where she stay, ay, oh
I want rings like Way, ay
She know I'mma king like James, ay
Bad bitch in the hills where she stay, ay
You know I ain't come here to play, ay

[Verse 2: JT the 4th]
I want rings like Way
Bad little bitch, and she stay out the way
Smoking on the style got my body outer space
Never trust a soul, never tell 'em where you stay, ah yay
'Cause people switching they day
I know my time is coming, all I gotta do is wait
Kobe in the clutch, just watch me fade away
Ay, I been getting money everyday
Keep a 'bout a six like I'm Drake
She wanna take a pic like I'm Drake
House in the hills like I'm Drake
Took a nigga bitch, one look all it take
This ain't competition, not a race
Diamonds 'round my neck, that's in your face
A lot of niggas dreaming to my place
And then they wake up and they still gotta wait

[Hook: Mayuex]
I'mma king like James, ay
I want rings like Way, ay
Bout to spread my wings, fly away, ay
House in the hills where she stay, ay, oh
