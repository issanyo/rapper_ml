Everything feels good, man

[Hook]
Talk talk talk so much but you ain't saying nada
Talk talk talk so much but you ain't saying nada

[Verse 1]
My girl cry so much til she get what she wanna
I fuck up a check and spend some on my mamma
I know all my real friends wanna see me come up
Cough cough cough that gas until I cough my lung up
Sip sip sip that drank I need to fill my cup up
Droptop all my cars I'm ready for the summer
Talk talk talk so much but you ain't saying nada
Work work work work work til I get a Rihanna
Who's man is this?
Who's man is that?
Getting his wristband checked, outside sending texts
He ain't never seen a check, he don't get no respect
Everytime you see him flex, everytime you see him flex

[Verse 2]
Took my life on one I had to make a promise
Strapped up for my life I always keep a condom
I can't roll the dice that's only in Nevada
I can't roll the dice that's only in Nevada
My girlfriend look better with no makeup (makeup)
Take my girl to shake shake, she gon shake up
Girl give me my phone before we break up
If she see my phone then we gon break up
Talk talk talk so much but you ain't saying nada (nada)
