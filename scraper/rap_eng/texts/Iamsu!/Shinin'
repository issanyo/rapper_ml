Hop up out that whip and chicks be runnin' up

Uh, they want that real shit, they had enough
I moved up out the hood we used to have it rough
Uh, I rep the gang amongst some other things
Yeah, I sample songs that my mother sings
Floatin' like I got a hovercraft or pair of wings
Oh that's your girl? She into sharing things
Apparantly, she ready, I bury beats, I'm deadly
I came up out the bottom, hoe I mean it when I said it
Give me credit, it's deserved, we came up from the curb
We the hottest in this thing, and I mean every word
