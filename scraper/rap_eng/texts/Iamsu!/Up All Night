[Hook: Iamsu!]
We be workin' up late all night
They try to tell us that we all hype
They just mad cause we won't stop
I could do this shit all the time
We be workin' up late all night
They try to tell us that we all hype
They just mad cause we won't stop
I could do this shit all the time, all the time

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
These boys lames, designer frames
Looking through Cartier's
In the bay, we run game
We just tryna get paid
Won't let nothing come in between us
That's just simple and plain
Even them country boys saying
"Suzy, we feeling you man"
I got a mouth full of gold
My momma hate when I wear it
These other rappers is old
I know it's fake when I hear it
We comin up in an era
Where everybody generic
These niggas ain't got no soul
Their lyrics don't got no spirit
Ooh, they don't really like me
(Oh, shit) You don't have to
Cause we gon, ride this bitch until the
Wheels fall off
Imma shit on everything like it's the
Bathroom

[Hook: IamSu!]
We be workin' up late all night
They try to tell us that we all hype
They just mad cause we won't stop
I could do this shit all the time
We be workin' up late all night
They try to tell us that we all hype
They just mad cause we won't stop
I could do this shit all the time

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Out of my shelf, feelin' myself
California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the stage
I'm hearing women screaming
Lifestyles of rap stars
With dreams of fast cars
But little do they know
These dreams is not far
I'm back, better than ever
On top of my game, steady climbin
I put them diamonds in a piece, on my chain
They just want a piece of the pie
Wanna a piece of mind
Feet on the ground, head in the clouds
Tryna reach the sky
Out on my own, fuck it, I'm grown
Now I'm back on my zone
On the chase, the rap race
Got me chasin' the throne
I don't believe you, so I'm riding to my
Own shit
And fuck you groupie hoes
I pull up with my main chick

[Hook: IamSu!]
We be workin' up late all night
They try to tell us that we all hype
They just mad cause we won't stop
I could do this shit all the time
We be workin' up late all night
They try to tell us that we all hype
They just mad cause we won't stop
I could do this shit all the time

[Verse 3: HBK CJ]
I done witnessed all kind of shit
Different shit in public
Ducking pictures, ducking women
On your bitch for nothin
Had your momma at the Shmop
When you were just a youngin
We came from nothin
We ain't here for nothin
Gotta list of those who hated on me
Check them off the list
Collect the checks and now they know me
Imma pull up with marijuana
Could smell it on me
California weather, bitches love when their
Hair is blowin'
I just took a trip to Calistoga
I stepped out on Malcom X
I'm just around the corner
It's the gang, I can name tons of dogged owners
She gone do it if I put down (offset)

[Hook: IamSu!]
We be workin' up late all night
They try to tell us that we all hype
They just mad cause we won't stop
I could do this shit all the time
We be workin' up late all night
They try to tell us that we all hype
They just mad cause we won't stop
I could do this shit all the time
