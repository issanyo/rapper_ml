[Intro]
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up [x5]
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much

[Hook]
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much

[Verse 1]
I'm the one that people talk bout
6 speed on your fly
Guaranteed I bring the broads out
I'm a dog like a Rottweiler
But I'ma back when they talk in my face
They don't talk now
Had to switch a couple friends up
Had to go and get my ends up
To go and pick the Benz up
Not a loser, I'm a winner
I'm a certified star, they won't let me in the enda
I hit the corner to the W
Once you make a little money
All the honeys fall in love with you
Puttin' women over money
That's a dummy move
She playin' wifey on the 'gram
But hit a hunnid dudes
Real-real macks ain't goin' for that
Rather go and spend 80 on a Cadillac
Take her to the city, she don't know how to act, oh yeah
Steal the flow, I boomerang it right back, oh yeah

[Hook]
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much

(E-40: Let the Counselor speak)

[Verse 2: E-40]
When my mama was pregnant with me
She used to crave [???] red dirt
Growin' up in the Bay
Gotta be tough or get your feelings hurt
A lot of people I know ain't on this Earth no more
They either down there with Satan
Or up there with the Lord
When God call, you bet' not miss your appointment
My auntie Karan? always tell me I'm anointed
As I reminisce, while I spit these rhymes
In the vocal booth, tears comin' out my eyes
I didn't have it like the other children did
Bottom lip poked out, underprivileged kid
Bossed up, in the streets like a reflector
Milligrams I had to measure
Posted up with my Heckler...and Koch
Not the record company, Koch Records
But a wop
Shaped like a capital L letter
Get on your top
But I'd rather not knock down my kind
I'm a boss
If you want some game then hit my line

[Hook]
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much
Ha-ha
