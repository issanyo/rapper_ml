[Intro]
She gon' do whatever just to see a Su concert
Eyes on Me, head to toe, that's my sponsor
Flex one time, now you think you an expert
Pure love, it's only one way, on my sweatshirt

[Hook]
She gon' do whatever just to see a Su concert
Eyes on Me, head to toe, that's my sponsor
Flex one time, now you think you an expert
Pure love, it's only one way, on my sweatshirt
Dreadlocks like I'm Gunplay, I feel fresher
I knew I would make it one day, feel no pressure
Hoppin' out that new Merceday, with my lady
I was rocking Jordan 16's in the eighth grade

[Verse 1]
Drop bombs like its mayday, I like May Day
Stacking com's like its payday it's a great day
Diamond charm kick like Pel√©, start a melee
Nothing wrong with a vacay, for like eight days, ay
I got different flavors for my women friend, ay
I been counting hundreds [?] to get it in, ay
She so thick she need a tummy tuck to fit it in
Flexing up without a gym, shout out uncle Jim

[Hook]
She gon' do whatever just to see a Su concert
Eyes on Me, head to toe, that's my sponsor
Flex one time, now you think you an expert
Pure love, it's only one way, on my sweatshirt
Dreadlocks like I'm Gunplay, I feel fresher
I knew I would make it one day, feel no pressure
Hoppin' out that new Merceday, with my lady
I was rocking Jordan 16's in the eighth grade
