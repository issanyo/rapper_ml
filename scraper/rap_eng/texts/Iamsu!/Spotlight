[Hook]
I'm in the spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
Pop off top like Bud Light
You are not boy, you a good liar
Just a cub scout singing by the campfire
Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
I'm top five, top five, top five
I got something money can't buy
So when my shit drop, tell 'em goodnight

[Verse 1]
I'm in that Maybach drop, highway 5
When the new work drop, bet it's gon' fly
She got a body money can't buy
If she act good, we can go to [?]
Queue awards for the good behavior
Give my haters diabetes, I got too much flavor
Suzy know the mayor, and the NBA players
Suzy [?] market shopper, a champagne sprayer
My granny see me in the paper, I feel like I made it
I put my brother in position, he turn 'round and hate it
I need control of everything 'cause the top is too basic
Don't give a fuck about the charts, in the streets I'm the favorite

[Hook]
I'm in the spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
Pop off top like Bud Light
You are not boy, you a good liar
Just a cub scout singing by the campfire
Spotlight, spotlight, spotlight
I'm top five, top five, top five
I got something money can't buy
So when my shit drop, tell 'em goodnight
