[Verse 1]
It's that gang, gang
That Heartbreak that bang, bang
That Rich city shit
Right 'cross that bridge from San Fran
Kid game like Can-can
Gas full, no engine
Old heads need to retire
Give them they pension
I'm chillin, I'm sipping
No blooding, No crippin'
Put the killer in the air
Make me feel a little better
Let me cough a little bitter
Make my eyes a little redder
Too real, that's how we describe each other
HBK, recognise me brother
Don't jive me brother
In the studio is where you find me brother
Top-fivin'
This rhyming
Being unsigned and
Don't really matter where I'm at
Come sign me
Need a few for it
Need a true story
Need a penthouse
Need a few stories
Need a few glories
A few bad bitches
Thinkin' about what you would do
If you had riches
Do with this livin'
Would you  be selfish?
Or would you be givin'
No pretendin'
Doug, we finished
Killed shit, ended
Get that bread, like we printed
Could extend it
Bust no recourse or premissin'
Bruh, we winning

[Hook]
Doug, we here  (Doug, we here)
Like we present (Like we present)
Made mistakes (Made mistakes)
Learned my lesson (Learned my lesson)
Got my head straight and my pants sagg
Where the Oxymoron?
You was sleepin' on me and I catched you snoring
Want stop 'til I cop the foreign
Makin' music, if I'm not recording
Work schedule, I cannot be dormant
Not be touring, not be grindin'
Turn the light on and put my lime in
In the limelight
I want hindsight
Always point 20 vision
I be Einstein
My minds eye will paint a picture
Be careful about who's withcha
And who's against ya
My crew could end ya
Reject your order
Return to sender
Retrurn to blenders
Chop niggas like
Like chop nigga like
Tell me when to stop, nigga like
Take it to the top, nigga righht
Uh, uh

Oh

[Interlude]
And I'm trippy out of my mind
I'm not trippin' off you I'm fine
I got that good drink in my cup
I feel like I'm flying
She text me all night long
Tryna come thru with her friends
I call my manager up
And cancel all of my plans
To be withchu
And I'm trippy out of my mind
I'm not trippin' off you I'm fine
I got that good drink in my cup
I feel like I'm flying
She text me all night long
Tryna come thru with her friends
I call my manager up
And cancel all of my plans
To be withchu
Yeah
