[Verse1: Bill Kaulitz]
Time that we have to talk
Are we on? Are we off?
On the phone, reality
Every word is killing me
You dirty bitch, beautiful
Treatin' me like an animal
Changing rules, I never knew
Let me get over you

[Chorus: Bill Kaulitz]
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a. Bang! Bang! Bang!
(Bang! Bang!...)

[Verse2: Shaggy]
How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna'
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, baby no way

[Chorus: Bill Kaulitz]
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a. Bang! Bang!
(Bang! Bang!...)

[Verse3: IamSu!]
Huuuuuh uh
Damn I started this shit
Fuck them nig' dog I mean allow this shit
I was talkin' money, you was some of, Cali young chick
Playin' supermodel mom, he was pillowtalkin'
I'm a money magnet, money wanna get about him
I got bitches, I got bitches, homie, light or dark skin?
From the riches, we will livin' homie, ride a park team
Robber always won a scratch, I'm a self-owned beast

[Bridge: Bill Kaulitz]
When I move on, when I move on I feel desire
You can move on, you can move on
Now I got into your love

[Chorus: Bill Kaulitz]
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Boy better run, boy better run, run, run
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun, gun, gun
Girl got a gun, girl got a gun. Bang! Bang!
Boy better run, boy better run, run, run
Girl got a gun. Girl got a. Bang! Bang!
