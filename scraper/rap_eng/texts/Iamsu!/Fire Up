[Chorus: IamSu!]
Wake up in the morning [?] get up
Cuban link chain bracelet light it up
Switch two strains we mad tie it up
Rolling this thing really trying to fire up, said
Who in this thing really trying to fire up
Who in this thing really trying to fire up, said
Who in this thing really trying to fire up
Who in this thing really trying to fire up

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Heart break shmop life gotta get the cash
We ain't doing nothing unless they coming with the bag tho
Women in my city that'll beat a nigga ass
[?] funny that's NASCAR fast
We don't do small hit the mall run it up
Gotta get the money man a million ain't enough
And we don't do front street chillin in the cut
First started in her inbox now I'm in her gut now
Two thousand dollars I'ma smack her on the ass with it
It ain't where you from man it's really where you at with it
Heart break kids got the game on smash with it
Tell her lay it down gave it to her by the pound then I

[Chorus: IamSu!]

[Verse 2: AKAFrank]
I said who in this thing really tryna fire up
Smoking on loud talking to my higher ups
Brush my teeth, they count my bands when I get up
Thinking how I'm gonna get it cause I know it's not enough
Man it's easy, when I break a bitch for check
She bring it straight to me cause I speak so direct
On flex, your muscle and your hustle don't connect
I'm balling on these niggas see it going through the net
She say she wanna ride with me
Killing these hoes better get an IV
Walk straight through the club what the fuck is ID
Man it's AKA Frank all these hoes know me aye

[Chorus: IamSu!]

[Verse 3: C Plus]
Say I'm on the pack and I send the fire up
When you your own boss can nobody fire ya
I'm getting little [?] had to tighten up
All I move it heavy weight and [?] never lighting up
Smell us in the building cause you know we lighting up
If they cut the lights off I bet my chain'll light it up
Little bro probably got the thing ain't nobody fighting us
But if I catch a fade I'm tryna Mike Tyson ya
I'm really about P so you know I throw it up
I'm really from the north so you know I throw it up
They handed me the torch so I gotta hold it up
In the club going up drinking till I'm throwing up

[Chorus: IamSu!]
