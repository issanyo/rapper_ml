[Intro: Gio Dee]
I don't give a fuck 'bout what your drugs do
Pop a Perc, you geeked up like you
Pop a Perc, you geeked up like you

[Chorus: Gio Dee]
I don't give a fuck 'bout what your drugs do
Pop a Perc, you geeked up like you Urkle
Uh, round these rap niggas I run circles
Ayy, most y'all niggas sound like someone hurt you
Ayy, I don't give a fuck 'bout what your drugs do
Pop a Perc and geeko like you Urkle
Uh, round these rap niggas I run circles
Ayy, most y'all niggas sound like someone hurt you

[Verse 1: Gio Dee]
What is wrong with these niggas round me?
What is wrong with these niggas round me?
They doin' drugs to get downy
Man, please get these geekers from round me
Nigga, I can't do it if I ain't really gain nothin'
Ain't no money in just gettin' fucked up
I was raised around the killers and the hustlers
Only way out was to sell or have a jumper
Ayy, I be doin' drugs don't get me wrong
Only do it just to make these songs
I'm a leader, you can't lead me on
Bet y'all gettin' geeked up to this song

[Chorus: Gio Dee]
I don't give a fuck 'bout what your drugs do
Pop a Perc, you geeked up like you Urkle
Uh, round these rap niggas I run circles
Ayy, most y'all niggas sound like someone hurt you

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Yeah, I don't give a fuck 'bout what your drugs do
Kush got me movin' slower than a slug do
I'm too deep up in these streets to go commercial
Tryna play me, no surprise if someone hurt you
I'm addicted, I need cures
You stole all my fuckin' swag, I need yours
Gio Dee, that's my nigga to the core
Turnin' up, every city on the tour
Come to the Bay and you gon' see 'bout us, yeah, yeah
Make a wish, Ali Baba, say a prayer
I got this shit, I won't leave mama
'Cause I always come back like 23's mama, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Gio Dee]
I don't give a fuck 'bout what your drugs do
Pop a Perc, you geeked up like you Urkle
Uh, round these rap niggas I run circles
Ayy, most y'all niggas sound like someone hurt you, damn
