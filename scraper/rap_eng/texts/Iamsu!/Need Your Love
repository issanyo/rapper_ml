[Chorus: Rayven Justice]
Girl you know it don't matter, any time you can have it
Don't worry 'bout nothing girl cause I need your love
Girl you know it don't matter, any time you can have it
Don't worry 'bout nothing girl cause I need your love
Cause I need your love

[Verse 1: Rayven Justice]
Ooh I can't believe it girl, the way you got me feeling, I'm feening
Tryna get up in between it girl
The way you're moving your body, you got me
I think my eyes deceiving me
Can't believe what I'm seeing, I mean it
I could never you see you leaving me
Girl your love you got me, you got me
I know you like it when I hit it from the back
Got a nigga feening for the pussy like crack
After I'm done you gon' have to take a nap
I gotta be honest, you got me

[Chorus: Rayven Justice]
Girl you know it don't matter, any time you can have it
Don't worry 'bout nothing girl cause I need your love
Girl you know it don't matter, any time you can have it
Don't worry 'bout nothing girl cause I need your love
Cause I need your love

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Yeah you know I like 'em long hair, thick as hell
Everything I spit sick, tell me get well
She wanna come to the crib, wanna get nailed
I'ma let her like a envelope in the mail
And she only want a young nigga on his grind
Every other day I'm on a campaign
I be putting work in, overtime
Every other week I'm on a damn plane
Every time a nigga leave, she be like come back
She be rolling up the weed, tryna get me to relax
Wear my heart up on my sleeve, throw it on a cold rack
Cause I'm a playa for life, I'm only staying the night
Heartbreak shit

[Chorus: Rayven Justice]
Girl you know it don't matter, any time you can have it
Don't worry 'bout nothing girl cause I need your love
Girl you know it don't matter, any time you can have it
Don't worry 'bout nothing girl cause I need your love
Cause I need your love
Cause I need your love
