What you know about waxed denim with sacks in 'em? oh oh
Do what you want, that's how I likes living .. oh oh
If you want it, you can make it happen.. oh oh
First have a dream, then you take action.. oh oh
Open your eyes, turn to the rising sun
If you can't find your path
Just trust that you'll find your one
When you open your eyes

Live your life young nigga
Young nigga live your life
I got my money on my mind
Bitches on my iPhone but I ain't got the time like I'm watchless
Bitch nigga watch this, I told you I was coming
You thought that I was lying
If I'm lying then I'm flying away
I'm a fly nigga already
So if I'm lying, nigga shoot me down
I ain't fucking with you clowns
Real niggas welcome in my circle
Them other niggas just a bunch of Urkels
Smoking on this purple
Got me sitting heavy
Imma take this shit just as far as God let me
Still the same nigga that you met when you met me
Ain't nothing changed but the song in the medley
You never met a nigga like me until you met me
Sharp minds ain't got your heart, now that'd deadly

I used to blame for the game
I don't know I just play it
I see something I don't like, best believe imma say it
I bite my tongue for no nigga and no bitch
A closed mouth don't get fed or get rich
Told em I want the top of the totem
Just wish some of these niggas would just try for my scrotum
Your girl shows up, I don't pick her, bro
My green stay on me like I'm piccolo
Yeah, a young king had a dream and I took action
I'm not Martin, but I'm marching, tryna make it happen
Make it rapping, what are the odds
That one day they would ever dare compare me to gods
I don't know
They're kinda slim
But fuck it, we finna do it, don't even trip, uh!
Without a plan, you plan to fail
And if you ain't winning, then you ain't playing well
