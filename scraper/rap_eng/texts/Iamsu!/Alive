[Intro Instrumental: Borgeous]

[Intro: IAMSU]
Yeah, ay!

[Verse 1: IAMSU]
I'm bottle up, it's been a long week
I think I need something
Haven't seen my dogs in a minute (in a minute)
Downside when you winnin' (turn up)
Upside as I'm back around
Oh, tings all check me down
I'm attractive now 'cause my money up
Chain shine like the sun is up

[Pre-Hook 1: IAMSU]
And we live in the nighttime
I'm lit to the sunshine
Good smoke, it's a fun time
Last year's with the squad was a punchline
I got work tomorrow, I'm like, fuck it
I got work tomorrow, I'm like, fuck it
'Cause I'm wide awake, go for upper
Gave every girl my number

[Hook: IAMSU]
I feel it in my bones
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
I've been on some fly shit
Here I go..
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah

[Post-Hook: IAMSU]
Feel alive, feel alive, oh, oh
Feel alive, feel alive, oh, oh
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah

[Verse 2: IAMSU]
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah
I've been on some fly shit
Blockin' up my mileage
Bust up the silence
I'm bout to dive in
Turn up the bass, I got the wave
She wanna ride it

[Pre-Hook 2: IAMSU]
Like it when she ride slow
How can I describe it, woh
Hoppin' out my ride, bad bitch on my side
Turn it up fast as you can count to 5
I just live my life, some say it's not right
We do what we like, bitch, don't kill my vibe
In my city do whatever just to get by
In my zone now I just wanna live by

[Hook: IAMSU]
I feel it in my bones
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
I've been on some fly shit
Here I go..
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah

[Post-Hook: IAMSU]
Feel alive, feel alive, oh, oh
Feel alive, feel alive, oh, oh
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah

[Instrumental Break: Borgeous]

[Hook: IAMSU]
I feel it my bones
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
I've been on some fly shit
Here I go
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah

[Post-Hook: IAMSU]
Feel alive, feel alive, oh, oh
Feel alive, feel alive, oh, oh
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah

[Instrumental Break: Borgeous]

[Outro: IAMSU]
I feel it my bones
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
I've been on some fly shit
Here I go..
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah

Feel alive, feel alive, oh, oh
Feel alive, feel alive, oh, oh
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
How can I describe it?
Damn, I feel alive, yeah
