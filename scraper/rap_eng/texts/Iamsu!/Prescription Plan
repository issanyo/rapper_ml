If I look depressed in the club, it's 'cause I probably am
When I look a mess out in public, I popped a..
Shoutout all my niggas on a similar prescription plan
Ooooooh
Used to lean it on these hoes just to get around
So I got a couple more, I'm that nigga now
And I'm always on the road, barely in the town
Yeah  I'm always on the road, barely in the town

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Always on the road, never in the town
But when I pull up in your city, come and link me now
I know I always hit you last minute but I hope that you can pull up and get it
We drink, we smoke , we think we know each other
You all on me, they think we go together
Never pop up on a random, Never outdoor for the sandal
But I need a companion, I'll go for the tandem

[Bridge: IamSu!]
North Hollywood baby, in a cross-over Mercedes
Never walk over my baby, I be all over my baby
Ima make you believe again, you know Ima leave again
Good smoke girl, breathe it in, I hope you don't leave with him

Yeah , yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah , yeah
We do what we want to do
Put your phone down
I'm right in front of you (yeah)
It got me in Hollywood
I'm lactose intolerant, but I did your body good
I'ma bring the real out of you, when I'm done say I'm proud of you
I don't mean to be arrogant, girl that's just what the money do
Why you back with your man again, swear that nigga a funny dude
Come and sit in my section, sip on some of this hunnid proof

[Bridge: IamSu!]
'Cus you my North Hollywood baby, in a crossover Mercedes
Never walk over my baby, I be all over my baby
Ima make you believe again, you know Ima leave again
Good smoke girl, breathe it in, I hope you don't leave with him
