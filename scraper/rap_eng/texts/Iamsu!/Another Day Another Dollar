[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm the nigga, nigga, nigga now, oh yeah
They used to front when I came around, back then
I got my city on my shoulders, no flex
I'm only getting older, no rest for me
It ain't no test in me, I passed flying colors
Do what I want, then I go pass to my brother
HBK gang over everything now
Even when I'm outchea by myself, they know my gang now
Had to rock my own shit, had to put the Bape down
I bet lil' mama still on the slide, like a playground
I flow like 8 mile, I'm hot like Cape Town
Cartier, Versace, and Hilton's them be my frames now
Play some bitches, cost some ditches, I ain't switching up the vision
Rest in peace to every beat I leave, is sleeping with the fishes
I'm still rocking True Religion, cause I'm true to my religion
Had a crazy premonition, they get lazy, I keep winning

[Hook]
It gets hard sometimes, to explain to myself
These niggas laying by theyselves
I'm in the zone like I came by myself
Another day, another dollar, yeah
Another day, another dollar
Another day, another dollar

[Verse 2]
And I go oh, to the haste
They got hoes, in they ways
Follow me and I'mma lead you to the goal, like I'm waze
I've been shaded up for days
They've been switching up they wave
I've been running up the check, the safe is running out of space
I be fly as outer space
I be buying all the J's
I got clientele for days
It's a science to this game
6 Speed, it's Suzy mane
It's a check for either name
If I gave it up tomorrow, this shit would not go away
I'm the best that ever did it, you can see it in my face
Dreads hanging in my face, cause it's a jungle in the bay
Put that money in the ground, build a tunnel to the cake
Trynna get my thoughts all out, it's just like funneling a lake
All these people trynna ask me about the money that I make
All the risk that I take, get the fuck out my face
I cannot be replaced, been the shit since MySpace
I can't help that I'm great, fuck who else in my way

[Outro]
It gets hard sometimes, to explain to myself
These niggas laying by theyselves
I'm in the zone like I came by myself
Another day, another dollar, yeah
Another day, another dollar
Another day, another dollar
