It’s the young terminator with a license to kill
Got the game on lock, sending kites in the mail
Im a rich motha fucka, you a bitch motha fucka
Can't love these hoes can't expect none from em
I said its Heartbreak Shmoplife get money fool
Got a red head like my name was al bundy fool
Love a brown skin or a light skin diva
Love maryjane but it gotta be sativas
You don’t like me I don’t like you either
Why my Yeezys cost more than your features
Wait your turn lil nigga cuz its me first
You sweet like desert research
Screaming motha fuckem all motha fuckem all
Hoes on a nigga balls like a nigga draws
Flow nice don’t piss it off
When yo back against the wall who you finna call
Playhouse standing on the bar
Sideshow I'm standing on the car
You don’t want war what you running for
Put me on the flyer, I bet all the bitches coming boy
Suzy 6 Speed living life full throttle
Dress so good I might fuck around and model
You be drunk getting courage from a bottle
Me and money bood up like we stuck up the Apollo
Did the tour got signed now the album coming
Im finna son you lil niggas like I'm Philip Drummond
Sprinting to the money and im still runnin
Said fuck one time and its still coming
I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
And its always 80/20 if we splitting the cash
Making headlines while you on some opener shit
She be looking at the dick like she open the gift
On a ladder a success, haters hopin I slip
You gone stop breathing ‘for u ever stop this shit, bietch!
Might hit up Greystone fuck with Orator
If you ain't tryna be the best then what you in it for
She going both ways like a kitchen door
My old bitch telling lies, don’t listen to her
Temple on a Sunday I want holiday
All these rappers looking like they owe me an apology
Peace to the weak niggas come say hi to me
Extra wavy like im wavy till you sitting by the beach, bietch!
