[Verse 1: Keak da Sneak]
A young bossy nigga, still a saucy nigga
Put a fork in me done, yep cross me nigga
Doping it, ask motherfucker, ya heard
Half these niggas is out here rapping, man these niggas is nerds
I don't put that on, that's my word
Go crazy from the first, second verse to the third
I was on syrup sipping, kissing the smoke
Coke white [?] Aeromax in Oakland
If my back and hip poking, then there's scratch to be broken
I need cash on delivery, sign the package and open
Out here on my [?], you know just how a nigga be
Put a nigga on I.E., act like he don't remember me
It don't cost a dime to stay out of mind
So seven won't mind 'cause you out of time
Racks, I ain't talking 'bout [?]
I was in the game [?]

[Bridge: 4rAx]
I'mma fly fly shit nigga
Ridin' round checkin' my traps (checkin' my traps)
All of this ballin' baby (swish)
Put a real nigga on the map (okay, okay)
And life's too short to be playin' with it
I was born too mac (you ain't know bitch, too short)
Now I'm a go-getter 'cause my palms stay itchin'
Gotta get that scratch

[Hook: 4rAx, Iesha Brooks & Keak da Sneak]
On my hustle
Uh, uh, on it like a [?]
On my hustle
On my hustle
Uh, uh, on it like a [?]
On my hustle

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Young nigga dreams tryin' to ride up in the Phantom (skrr)
I'm on TV like damn near every channel
Hoppin' off  the mabtel with flavor haters can't handle
Fliest on the planet her pussy in Tropicana (juicy)
Fresh Nicki, Nicki, I'm taking pictures with Iggy
Me and all my team we gon' split the green fifty-fifty
Shorty say she missed me I'm pullin' up in a hurry
Smokin' like a hippy, you haters hate, I ain't worried
Aww shit, got me in the mix
Need ten million 'fore I turn twenty six
Boss up, burn up, gotta stack dough
Kicks retro, never let 'em see you sweat though
Ay, been a one from the get go
On the road to the top taking steps
I'm a pimp, on my own, fuck your mine
Heartbreak kid, you gon' see me on my grind

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: J Stalin]
Cup server, certified money getter
Wig splitter, I ain't scared of no nigga
Runnin' through these checks 'till I get a million
I just keep stackin' like it's no ceilin'
These broke niggas stuck up in their feelin's
I could really give a fuck what you want, dude
All I know is that new hundred dollar bills blue
And to this game I done stayed true
Keep a banger on me never been a rooty poot
Some of you niggas is sweeter than some froot loops
Fuck 'em all, 'cause tomorrow I'mma buy a coupe
Lil' nigga gettin' money like I'm playin' hoop
To my niggas [?] throw that alley-oop
I'm really ballin' on you niggas
Point guard, I'm a starter on you niggas
Pussy fiendin' I can [?] on you niggas
