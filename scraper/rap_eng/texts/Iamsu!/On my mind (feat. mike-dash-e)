Yeah, huh? Ah, ah, ah, ah

Bobs in the club, pocket full of dubs
I'm the type to make a couple thousands just for popping up
Pay my own bills, house on the hill oh
Fake ass rappers, softer than a pillow
Yeah I'm from the rinnage, legendary put me in the guiness
Took over the game and I won't stop until I'm finished
Looking for a simmons, run her like image
Niggas ain't balling, they just do it for the image
I'm winning, grab the shit the dj is spinning
That's what happens when a real one get it
Locomotor I ain't playing, I ain't stopping nigga
Till it's hell you disrespect, I'm molly whopping nigga
Shout out problem, it's my Compton molly popping nigga
This city popping, fuck your label you ain't popping nigga
Yeah, I'ma start trippin on fools
Different type of nigga do a different way do

[Hook]
I said I'm back on my bullshit, back on my bullshit
Niggas steady talking but they never gonna do shit
I said I'm back on my bullshit, back on my bullshit
Niggas steady talking but they never gonna do shit
I'm fin to wail out, go crazy oh, go crazy on, go crazy on em
I'm fin to wail out, go crazy oh, go crazy on, go crazy on em

Real sneaks attract them red freaks stay on me
Like fleas, get rammed like track meats
My team they can't beat, so they wanna be a fail out
Blowing like a land mine, run up in this man down
Keep these keys but these niggas wanna push me
Just because I get it that don't mean that I'm a pussy
Wolf gank pluck on a track how I cook this
Catch me in the city prolly jump a stack of...
Gang shit, got her ready to fuck it low
Got her home, had her touching her toes you know
When it's done, kick her out, it's time to go
Ride me like a down low, spin it till your spine show
Gemy got my mind gone, a nigga twisted except no invitation
I'm bout bizness, I'm authentic
Rap sugars...get lost in it, check the record now I'm lost in it

[Hook]
I said I'm back on my bullshit, back on my bullshit
Niggas steady talking but they never gonna do shit

Niggas steady talking but they never gonna do shit
I'm fin to wail out, go crazy oh, go crazy on, go crazy on em
I'm fin to wail out, go crazy oh, go crazy on, go crazy on em

Nigga with the flow, nigga with the dough, nigga with the hoes
Lil pussy eating nigga with the frown
Bitches love it, so they play in it
Money like a suit bitch yeah I stay with it
Stay with it, stay ...when I'm off the money though
Big balling is the hobby, yelling kemosabe walk
On the front, like a lobby though
Niggas can't stand it, team strong, paper long, boys panoramic
Loaded up the cannon, now it's bout to fire
Fucking bitches while I'm riding out no tire
Surrounded by clouds like a sky rock
Blowing weed that got me higher than god's eyes
God's eyes, man it's real, balling on the field
Standing on they heads and let the pussy niggas kill
Please lord forgive me everyday fare
...now drop and do the head chin

[Hook]
