Right back on your mind
That's forever no that's never gonna die
Right back on your mind, back on your mind
I stay on my grind
That's forever no that's never gonna die
I stay on my grind, I stay on my grind

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Back on your mind
I love the cash and I say that all the time
I been on my G, since Lil Wayne put out 500 Degreez
You want a show bro you gonna have to pay me
Don't leave the whip until I get my money
You know that's all I believe
We in this bitch I swear to god we won't leave
I love my squad love my team
Don't love these hoes but I'm in love with the pink
Sometimes I sit back and think
Why everybody know me when I walk in the bank
And this still ain't a game
Never scared of you niggas and we still ain't afraid
Cause we still run the bay
They can hate if they want but we don't care what they say
Cause I'm

[Verse 2: Skipper]
Yep, got my gang in this bitch
Stick to the fundamentals that I learned in the Rich
Oh, and you know Imma shine
Heart Breakers we be the gang I rep that shit all the time
Yeah, and I'm bringing it back
Got bitches getting submissive off the Hennessy Black
The Picasso of Rap
Suzy played me this banger and I said it's a wrap
Yep, I'm that nigga with juice
Take her back to the crib that bitch know just what to do
I'm pulling up out the lot in something missing the roof
Can't tell me that it's impossible I'm living the proof
I'm keeping them cookies rolling like a michelin do
BelAire got your bitch getting loose
Haters saying it ain't fair now they calling a truce
On the grind all the time make it do what it do
Ooh, Skipper

[Verse 3: Kool John]
I threw a party and I'm selling it out
It ain't about money then I make her re-route
You talking rap I'm the best of them out
My cash is getting straighter, like I measured it out
I heard your bitch was a dick-pleaser
I make her knees crumble like bread pieces
The Uber picking us up, my flow is super deluxe
Got stupid kicks like I'm chuck
And I'm fresh off tour with a bitch by the shore
All the liquor get em poured up
You smell the weed in my pores
And I'm fucking all the whores in the party
And it's going up
A rap stars splurgin' off the black card
Jumped so many hurdles could have been a track star
Fucking around in my BMW
With Su and P, with 3 L dubs (Yee!)
