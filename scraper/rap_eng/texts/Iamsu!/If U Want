[Chorus: IamSu!]
All the chickenheads, be quiet
Not a sound, not a sound
Shake it fast, start riots
Set it off, set it off in this bitch girl
I'll put you in a plane if you want (if you want)
I'll put you in the game if you want (if you want)
All you gotta do is tell me what you need
And I proceed to do everything he don't

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Big dog, chop in the same spot
Every time I wanna stop they say keep goin'
Don't stop, don't stop
Big bank, Sudi Mane makin' big withdrawals
Full speed, can't stop, mean that
Pockets on Fat Joe, lean back
Brand new Benzo, seat back
Word around town, bitch I got the streets back
Back, back like my spine
I was just like you once upon a time
Forgiato when I ride
All about my business like a suit and tie
She at the red light like the real Roxanne
Ten minutes later, texting me the address
Hit your city with the front and the back end
All she want is a young rich black man

[Chorus: IamSu!]
All the chickenheads, be quiet
Not a sound, not a sound
Shake it fast, start riots
Set it off, set it off in this bitch girl
I'll put you in a plane if you want (if you want)
I'll put you in the game if you want (if you want)
All you gotta do is tell me what you need
And I proceed to do everything he don't

[Verse 2: Drakeo the Ruler]
Came in this bitch with the mops and the drugs
Tell a nigga you’ll get everything you want
Mr. road runners, drive the coupe like it’s stolen
And if I ain’t get a JPay from you then it’s over
I’m fresh up out the pen, I done spiked all my sodas
I’m drinkin’ Act, you can smell my aroma
Your nigga was a dog bitch, well I can do you colder
Up in hell with a chinchilla on, on four pills I’m rollin’
Blood drippin' off my Louboutins, they soakin’
Mud walk through Neimans like I’m Moses, bitch I’m chosen
Longstocking, show boating
Hulk Hogan, gold medals, more trophies
Benjamin Franklin my friends when I'm lonely
Mr. fucking Mosely, mr. hood trophies
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, they know me
Mr. fucking Mosely, mr. hood trophies
Big banc uchies on the dashboard, they know me, ugh

[Chorus: IamSu!]
All the chickenheads, be quiet
Not a sound, not a sound
Shake it fast, start riots
Set it off, set it off in this bitch girl
I'll put you in a plane if you want (if you want)
I'll put you in the game if you want (if you want)
All you gotta do is tell me what you need
And I proceed to do everything he don't
