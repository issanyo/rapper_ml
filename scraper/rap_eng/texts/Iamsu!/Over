[Intro]
This world is far from kind
So I stay high up out my mind
This world is far from kind

[Hook]
This world is far from kind
So I stay high up out my mind
They said it's easy but they lied
You ain't got nobody else, nobody else
Until it's over, over, over
You ain't got nobody else, nobody else
Until it's over, over, over
You ain't got nobody else, nobody else

[Verse]
Pay attention to fools and I'm probably done as they are
And if I catch a vibe, I'mma pass you off to J. R
Very observing for pussy niggas I will stay far
The real I remain - the game is who they are
As they speak to the king - my homies is my homies
The world is so cold, it will leave you so lonely
Cause people need medicine, and people is hungry
But we don't do shit about it and that's how it's gon' be
Until we wake up, and it's in front to face us
And we can't blame nobody but ourselves because we made this
I'm in a position for me to be heard, I need to be heard
Every noun and every verb, say the truth - make it hurt
Been around the world, been around some girls
Been around the block, been around the 'burbs
So never will I stop, I do this for the city, tryna put us on the map
Keep your mind above the traps

[Hook]
