[Verse 1: IamSu!]
What up? Aloha
Turn up and don't stop
Straight out the park car
Me, Suzy Sosa
I just want a bag full of cash
Couple cribs, couple whips, chicks hella back
It's not a racist american
Money very long, killin' every song
Hit the city, gotta checking a fucking carry-on
And they sticking, it was over a [?]
Sexy mami, press me, further follow
Bless me with the back keys, save my hallow
Jet skis in white [?], watch me pull up on a beach sayin' "Baby we can do it every weekend"

[Verse 2: AD]

Good to harder look, California I'm rappin'
Baby I'm a gangster, I'm checking who was out stepping
I just wanna party, I don't wanna fight now
Your baby daddy brokes, so tell a nigga pipe down
We gon' turn this thang up and we gon' turn this lights down
Let me see you right now, knock it at a bar round
Tell a little cocky, but fucking a girl [?]
Step into this section, no flexin', girl don't be nervous
Bouta hoes we takin', no stressin' [?] swervin'
Take you to the Telly, get ready and get to service
But I don't wanna wife ya
Fuck what you think, get it bang like a Michael
Ass looking fat, then I probably want a nicer
Tell you all the hooks and I don't never got a [?] way
