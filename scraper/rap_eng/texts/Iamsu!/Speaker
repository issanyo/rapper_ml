[INTRO]
Yeah
HBK niggas know how we play
And I can't quit all I know it gang shit

[Verse 1: Skipper]
Little mama trying to cut, like a ginsu
Said it's all good if you not on your menstrual
Rich city nigga ain't a hood I ain't been to
Haters trying to block but I hit em with a spin move
When it come to rapping a lot of a niggas can't see me
Unless it's on the radio or probably on your TV
Two hits down and I'm going for a three P
All I do is win never trying to see defeat
Finna blow up like I stepped on a land mine
You ain't gotta like it give a fuck about a co-sign
Know a couple goons always ready when it's show time
Washed up rappers get hung on the clothes line, uh
Niggas know that I'm coming for the thrown
Four flat 40 when I'm running for the door
Girl if this your song get your ass up on the floor
Go and shake it for a nigga shake it until it's time to go
Skipper

[Hook: IamSu!]
You know what it is through your speaker
Heart break kids is some freaks uh
Whiling like a nigga just got outta jail
And I'm getting money I could make bail
You know what it is through your speaker
Heart break kids is some freaks uh
Whiling like a nigga just got outta jail
And I'm getting money I could make bail

[Verse 2: Skipper]
Mama always told never let these niggas catchup
Now I got them scared cause they know that I'm the next up
Coming for they head might as well put they vest up
Nigga I been sick I'm overdue for a check up
Rich city California, something like the prince
Born in brookside they ain't been the same since
Here to lather up the game time for you to rinse
Every time I hit the ball got them running for the fence, home run
She wanna leave her man cause he is no fun
Feeling like the man cause she chose up
HBK yeah they know us, turn into a hater cause you fell off
Young sammy make them do what I say so
They all bang looking like they on the pay roll
Recess popping bottles by the case load
HBK Gang who they came for

[Hook]
