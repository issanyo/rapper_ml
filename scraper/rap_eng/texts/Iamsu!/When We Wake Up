Been out at the club all night long
My girl hit my phone for me to hurry on
She said she can't wait for me to get it on
I tell her, "slow down, baby hold on!"
I'm about to leave the club and I'm drunk as fuck
So when the morning girl, I'mma beat it up
Breakfast in bed, I'mma eat it up
Put your legs in the air, no keep them up
Don't you put 'em down, I'mma put 'em down
Slide your panties to the side, ain't got to pull 'em down
Ass so fat, gotta put it down
