[Verse 1: Skipper]
What's happening my nigga, what that shit do
Can you hear me now, tell me if I'm getting through
I'm in your household chilling in your living room
Act like you know and if you don't you better get a clue
I'm on my king shit I'ma need a crown
Bitches say they love me but they hate it cause I get around
Hit my nigga Daghe when I'm in the town
Peaking mainstream but they still love us underground
I'm the same nigga they didn't expect
Stayed on the grind now I'm getting these checks
The money come first then it's power, respect
I've never been the type that will settle for less
They wonder if I'm ready the answer is yes
And I ain't finna stop until they say I'm the best
And even after that I'ma stay on they neck
I ain't giving em rest, make sure they never forget

[Hook: Skipper]
Word, that's my word
Man I swear to god that's my word
Put it on my mom nigga that's my word
Always on the job nigga that's my word
That's my word, that's my word
Man I swear to god nigga that's my word
Put it on my mom nigga that's my word
Always on the job nigga that's my word

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
That's my word it belong to me
She wanna hear a real nigga give the phone to me
I don't care what it cost I'ma boss take a loss
Get it back after doing one song with me
Same dudes that was off now they on with me
And we all getting paid nigga
Young Suzy HBK Gang nigga
Ain't nothing change but the check on the name nigga
I mean the name on the check it's a game or respect
No time for these lames
I ride around my city all the kiddo's scream bingo
When they see me in that thing
Shop in New York you shop at Old Navy
I be fucking up a check and my clothing options is crazy
They say my region barley breathing
Haters say we won't make it
I want this shit I'ma take it
I flunk this shit if I got it we about it (Aye)

[Verse 3: Dave Steezy]
And I be like fuck it, rolling up sativa
Looking down on all you little niggas that's beneath us
The way a nigga do it no there is no way you can teach this
Shmop life nigga go crazy on a feature
Yeah, and I smoke the best reefer, chiefing
Everywhere I go like it's legal
Steezing, we are not the ordinary people
So please approach me with respect if I meet you
No competition I could beat you
You niggas see through and that's why I don't fuck with yall
All my niggas solid on a job and we just focus on
Getting that cake, taking no breaks
Fuck with the real we don't fuck with no fake
I'm tucked somewhere baked and I'm plotting on cake
Nigga, you don't know you gonna learn
Realest niggas in the game that's my word

[Hook]
