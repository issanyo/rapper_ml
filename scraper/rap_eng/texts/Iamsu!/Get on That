[Hook-Iamsu!]
(Never bring her back, said you dealin’ wit a mack)
I get on that bitch
(And never bring her back, yeah you dealin’ wit a mack)
I get on that bitch
(And never bring her home, you dealin’ wit a real, leave it all alone)
Fucking with me,I get on that bitch

Verse 1-Iamsu!
Name a better playa than me
I be makin’ moves every day of the week
Ballin’ like a fool, hoes thought I was geeked
Until I got em’ in the bed , turn a nun to a freak yah’mean?
Want beats? I need green, we the elite team
Gassin’ em no steam
Never do True Religions I can’t do the white seams
Give her that dope dick you know that she might fiend, ha
Suzie get the camera make a film wit’ her
Watch ya self, you dealin’ wit a real nigga
Ill nigga, pop that pussy like a pill baby
Have a party on that call it tailgatin’

[Hook]

Verse 2-Problem
Girl what’s happenin’, rollin’ like traffic
Pop 1, pop 2 ya gone like magic
Compton Maverick, keep shooters like Dallas
Make her give me green and I toss it like salads
Livin’ life fabulous, never been average
Bitch I’m fresh ho, check out these fabrics
Ho bend on over like a cotton picker
Say her dreams to have sex wit a Compton nigga
Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Well is it cool
If go..hold up
Maybe I should slow up, strap it up then beat the hole up
Like this dick is bout’ to go up in this mothafuckin’ bitch right here
