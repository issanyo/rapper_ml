[Hook]
She say she's done with me but it's not the last time
I love talking baseball -- America's pastime
Now I got the wave, they searching all day for me with a flashlight
Big dough watch the cash fly, whole world off my last hype

[Verse 1]
I think she's from Shanghai
I always keep her in mind
Elementary how they stand in line
I'm the teacher today I got time
I think I know too much
But I never show too much
I remember eating frozen cups
Last time the boy seen me he froze up

[Hook]
She say she's done with me but it's not the last time
I love talking baseball -- America's pastime
Now I got the wave, they searching all day for me with a flashlight
Big dough watch the cash fly, whole world off my last hype

[Verse 2]
Make her walk a fine line
I treat her like fine Chine
VVS all in my eyes
Tell her look on the bright side
And she knows just what I like
Never trip keep your shoes tied
Spread love don't abuse life
View yours how I view mine
I think I'm one of a kind
And I have a special mind
It took a while just to get it right
Spread my wings and watch me fly

[Hook]
She say she's done with me but it's not the last time
I love talking baseball -- America's pastime
Now I got the wave, they searching all day for me with a flashlight
Big dough watch the cash fly, whole world off my last hype
