I'm sayin' fuck how you feel, fuck how you feel (yeah)
I'm eatin' everyday (day), tryna get a meal (meal)
And you know I got all my niggas in here (you know I got)
And you know I got all my niggas in here (you know I got all my niggas)
I'ma show you what's real, show you what's real (what's real)
Show you what's real, show you what's real (AKA, AKA, yeah, AKA)
And you know I got all my niggas in here (you know I got)

[Verse 1: AKAFrank]
Realer than most, I could come to your coast
Talkin' bands, talkin' bread, tryna make me a loaf
[?] some dope [?], only get you a dose
I know some niggas on the block and I ain't talkin' the post
And we only talkin' money, gotta pay for a quote
And I know that cheque comin', you just prayin' and hope
And you could pay me for a walkthrough, I'd make a good host
And I only fuck with bitches who be doin' the most (oh)
I get a lotta that, it's fabolous, then she holla back
They recognize Ben Frank, they acknowledge that
They say that they love me but they hate that I made it, I stated (I stated)
I made a way for my niggas and loved the lane, I paved it
They call me baby 'cause, baby I'm a grown man (AKA)
Stop frontin' on me, quit posin'
She open, 24/7
Blessed boys, I done died and went to heaven

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Came with the gang, [?], for sure though
Bet you I could fuck you like a porno, a porno
Bring it to your door, no DiGiornio, DiGiornio
I forgot your name, I be on though, I'm on no'
Need my money, need my money pronto, due pronto
If it ain't 'bout cash it ain't a combo, no combo
Murder everything I leave a John Doe, a John Doe
Bet you she gon' shake it like a Congo, a Congo
Straight to that bread, dreamin' 'bout cake when I lay in my bed
She know I'm that dude and she say that instead
In them lanes that she dealin' with
Next cheque I get, I'm goin' straight to the dealership
'N' coppin' it, you know who I'm rockin' with
Smokin' on that rocket ship, I got it from a continent
And they gon' get it poppin' if they go and get the team involved
She kick it with you but when she leave, she gon' give me a call
