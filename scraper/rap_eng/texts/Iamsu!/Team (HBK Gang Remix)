[Intro: Lorde]
Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out, 15x

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Uh, yea
Living in cities with no explanations
Stuck in this place so better housing is the destination
Your living situation is the worst but that don't stop you from leaving the store with the newest purse
Money don't come easy
Shit, and friends don't either
Remember eating on the floor, almost poor and no cable but some reason got Cousin Skeeter
Living better, the family are straight
In good hands, that's All State
They play with us, to them is all games
But, to come where I'm from, it's a long way

[Hook: Lorde]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within' my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
You know who the team is
Straight to the top, yeah you know what the dream is
Came up with a scheme quick, a multimillionaire dollar one
When your back against the wall, tell me who you callin' on
The fam, the squad, the team, I mean
We was broke sharing jeans, now we on the big screen
Heartbreakers
We was the ones gettin' our hearts broke
Open up my mind it's like God spoke
He told me everything I needed to know
The young concrete rose with no water to grow
But now we in full bloom when we walk in the room
People already know what we're tryin' to do, oh

[Hook: Lorde]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within' my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Bridge: Lorde]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

[Hook: Lorde]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within' my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Outro: Lorde]
We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know and you know and you know
