[Intro: IamSu!]
Yeah, huh
Flaco what up, hehe
Yeah

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Today was a good day
Just deposited a check
Young nigga flex birds to the jets
Fire hot flow burn through your chest
Drop dead, on to the next, word to the best
Niggas scared of falling off, like they living on the edge
They trying to steal the soul
One point five that's the millionth sold, uh
Always in the studio
It's three in the morning but do I give a fuck, no
It's me and my homies we be like roll it up, smoke
And if I'm performing you know I'm taxing for a show
Cause ain't shit for free, my whole clique some G's
Blow a whole check it ain't shit for me
I'm single looking for work like the classifieds
Young mastermind after cash on a savage grind, Haaan?

[Hook: Flaco Rackz]
I got the baddest hoes in my life
Got diamonds and gold in my life
Trying to do a thousand shows in my life
This is what I chose for my life

[Verse 2: Flaco Rackz]
Nigga please I was raised in public housing
Nigga I need my thousands by the thousands
Ain't nothing funny but we smiling
I'm just trying to relax off somebody island
I'm used to that water
See I'm a bay nigga
You talk that shit we walk up like 'Aye what you say nigga'
'Bout it though
Don't just wanna be rich I wanna be powerful
Cause nigga you just don't know how fast an hour go
Still old school [?]
Nigga so smooth yeah I got swag
Nigga clothes new yeah, Pop tags (Woah)
Eating while they starve
Revolution on these niggas call it [?]

[Hook x2]
I got the baddest hoes in my life
Got diamonds and gold in my life
Trying to do a thousand shows in my life
This is what I chose for my life

[Instrumental]
