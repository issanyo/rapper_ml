Yeah, Pretty Ladies!

Ride On It
Aye, Armani!
Ride On it
Go and ride on it

All up on it, all up, all up on it, all up on it, on it
All up on it, all up, all up on it, all up on it, on it

[VERSE 1: Jonn Hart & Armani DePaul]
Ass so fat that I can see it from the front
Baby got an ass on her
Heard shawty lookin’ for a nigga that can give her what she want
And I ain't tryna pass on her

This girl’s got me teapoled
Schooling like leapfrog
They coming up short and my money 10 feet tall, feet tall
Pull up with them with them Ds and them Double Ds on ‘em
Top down please honey, I know all you see is money
Gs on me, got my team with me, Double Ds on me
You would think that I was Chucky the way the cheese coming
Head down, ass up, put the pussy on me
Then ride this dick like a pony

[HOOK]
I got her looking she want it, want it (ride on it)
She gone have to ride on it (ride on it)
Now she cushioned all on it, on it (ride on it)
Cause she wanna ride on it
All up on it, all up, all up on it, all up on it, on it
All up on it, all up, all up on it, all up on it, on it

[VERSE 2: Kool John]
I let her on it, jump up on it
I have you riding from the night till the morning
I heard you working now and doing stretches
Godamn I love your body, it’s a blessing
No discretion, then I plug it in
Heard your best friends trying to get it in
And imma knock it out
Like packer ya
Last Benz I was in, I just checked it out
Imma couple hunna holder
Being real from the start
Bad chick on my dick like a steamrunner
She teach me things, I call her Ms. Thang
Then she slide through and ride me like a mustang

[HOOK]
I got her looking she want it, want it (ride on it)
She gone have to ride on it (ride on it)
Now she cushioned all on it, on it (ride on it)
Cause she wanna ride on it
All up on it, all up, all up on it, all up on it, on it
All up on it, all up, all up on it, all up on it, on it

[VERSE 3: IamSu!]
We just chill like 2 peas no pot
Definitely the baddest bitch I ever had so far
Treat her like a diva, but when it comes to cake she’ll bake it like I need her
A fly Senorita
Her body so nice, she inspire me to right
My swag typo so there’s gotta be a type
Love towns play it loud on the stereo
Imma break the walls down Chris Jericho
Come to pick you up, the kids like there he go
Ralph Moore, shawty more harshes than a merry go round
Carousel, light skin, caramel
Trust me Imma put it down very well

All up on it, all up, all up on it, all up on it, on it (ride on it, ride on it, ride on it]
All up on it, all up, all up on it, all up on it, on it (ride on it, ride on it, ride on it)
