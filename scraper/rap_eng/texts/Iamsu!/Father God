Yea
True story
Real life
Uh
Bow Your Head
Bow Your Head
Bow Your Head
Uh
Yea, yea

(Verse 1)
I’m not a king, bitch I’m a Pharaoh
Wear Bathing Ape for My apparel
I told my homies let me lead the way
I pray to God I see another day
I’m 23 and ball like 23
In every other month I make like 10 at least
SPANISH Mamasita tell her Ven Aqui
With some lime-a-ritas when we in a suite
Fuck a thousand dollars I spend that on sneaks
Fuck a thousand dollars I spend that on jeans
These niggas never felt no hunger pain
I used to steal food to fill my dinner plate
Where I’m from people dyin every day
Doin what they can, they try to make a way
Where I’m from people dyin every day
Doin what they can, they try to make a way

Bow Your Head
Bow Your Head
Now let us pray
Uh
Now let us pray
Uh uh
Said bow your head
Let us pray
Father God, let us see another day
Now bow your head
Let us pray
Father God, let us see another day

(Verse 2)
I could go a whole lifetime without yo co-sign uh
Cuz I write dope lines
Dopper than coke lines
I’ve been here for the whole time
I ain’t never had no time to sit
So homie, it’s go time
And I can’t make no promises
‘Cause it’s all about the almighty dollar
Came from the land of the lost and forgotten
Drake told niggas that he started from the bottom
But you dig a little deeper, and that's probably where you'll find us
Find us in the middle of the city steady grinding
Came up from the bottom of the bottom tryna come up
Young king, I don’t want my head cut off
People act funny when the bread cut off
Placin my vote that I never turned as you know
Turnt up like I popped some Adderall
Lateral pass is success to my homies, I never thought twice it was simply a matter of fact
Stackin them racks, hopin off stages across the globe
Learning bout things only God should know
Steadily stackin my broccoli though, watch me go

Ape shit on these niggas
Too dumb on these hoes
Stackin up my bills
Countin all this dough

And these things that came from rap
You better get that through your skull
I’mma eat until I’m full, I’m shinin on you, never dull it aye

Bout here really
Bout here really
Now let us pray
Now let us pray
Bout here really
Bout here really
Let us pray, let us pray
Father God, let me see another day
Bout here really
Bout here really
Let us pray, let us pray
Father God, let me see another day

Have mercy on my soul
But really I’ll turn up
Have mercy on my soul
