[Hook: Kool John]
Girl quit cattin, you know you want this dick
Girl quit cattin, and let a real nigga stick
Girl quit cattin, you know you want this dick
Girl quit cattin, and let a real nigga stick

[Verse 1: Kool John]
Let a shmop nigga cum or come over
I leave the pussy feeling like its ran over
The thing in my pants like a Land Rover
Don't play about my cheese nigga need to hand it over
My dick big I told a bitch to go look at it
She unzip my pants and said can a bitch grab it
I be all up on her bumper like we up in traffic
Shmop nigga attract bitches like we fucking magnets
I smoke weed but my granny call it dope
If you say I'm not the best rapper than you smoking dope
My bitch lean back take hits like rope-a-dope
Say you gonna shoot up my party bitch I really hope you won't
Got a couple real niggas that'll get up on your throat
If you ain't about money we don't want you round ho
From the bay lames tryin' to steal our sound yo
All the big booty bitches turn around ho

[Hook]

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
Quit cattin little bitch why you wanna do that
Young rich Filipino they keep saying who that
I'm that, bitch taker, chips maker
Got your bitch in the room she a risk taker, uh
She keep playin I dunno why
She was trying to hop in when I rolled by
Smoking on strong I'm the most high
Thirsty ass hoes I'm approached by
They don't get no love, they trying to smoke my drugs
Trying to get up in my section when I'm with my thugs
No way, I need head first
Million dollar mind with the pen work
I'm trying to see you naked press Send first
She rolling in the club like Fred Durst
She sucked me on her knees call it leg work
Put it in her jaw, now she want it in her raw

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skipper]
Got a bitch that love to fuck me, got a bitch that buy me sneakers
Broke a bitch heart, left her picking up the pieces
Ask me for some money I don't know you bitch, you're reachin'
All about the paper bet I touch it like a Deacon
Bitches on the hunt for me I get em every season
Steady trying to cuff me, I don't fuck with no polices
Quit with the games I ain't playing no charades
If you want some good dick better meet me back stage
Higher education let her suck me on vacation
Just had relations now she saying we related
Want me on a record don't be slacking on my payments
Got it fucked up if you think that I'ma chase you
Heart break nigga smoking tree like a Jamaican
Might buy your bitch all the money I be making
Never been the type to wait for nothing I'ma take it
Bitch I know you want it better quit with all the playing

[Hook]
