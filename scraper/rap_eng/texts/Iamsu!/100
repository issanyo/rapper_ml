Tell the waitress go and get a tissue

Nah, 100

Tryna see the tattoos on my stomach, I
Got shots in the air, where the gun at, I (blaow)
Swear the head on her look real right

Taking straight shots and she going up
She a goon gobble up then she pull her panties up
Bet a hundred double up, count it, I don’t need the luck
It is just, it's money on my mind
Mansion, no condos, no time for combos
I need that pronto, be real, don’t lie though
Show me them tongue tricks, only you and I know
Fuck around and get your rent paid
