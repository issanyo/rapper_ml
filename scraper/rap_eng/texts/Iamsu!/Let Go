(Chorus: Tank)
I’mma keep it trill
And you ain’t gotta worry bout a damn thing, yea
Your brother’s on the loose
And everybody’s tryna get at you baby
But I’mma find your love and I’mma never let go
I’mma find your love and I’mma never let go

(Verse 1: Iamsu!)
Okay I’m dressed to the night, Shawty is a 10
I’mma get it in, hit repeat and do it all again
Young and independent, my last dime on you
It’s money well spent
Ladies and gents I will bear no expense to get a little closer to you and yours
Open up this world of mine and maybe you can explore
I be openin doors, the sentimental shit
Shit like yo body’s a superpower, sure I could be yo Kryptonite
I thinkin bout trips and flights
Different places we can go as long as you promise to me yo love is unconditional
Uh, your heart is what I’m on a mission for
Ho and now sure hard for me to die and to me listen too
I’ll write the words to describe everything I see
So I’m thankin you for this place as you standin in front of me
A work of art, I’m callin you Mona Lisa
And I want that whole thing, I don’t want a piece

(Chorus: Tank)
I’mma keep it trill
And you ain’t gotta worry bout a damn thing, yea
Your brother’s on the loose
And everybody’s tryna get at you baby
But I’mma find your love and I’mma never let go
I’mma find your love and I’mma never let go

(Verse 2: Iamsu!)
Pull up in that red, why you fix yo lips?
I be tryna kiss on you like every single inch
But let me slow it down before I do too much
You seem a bit uptight, how bout you loosen up?
I can be everything that you wanted, tell me all your desires
Write a list of your fantasies, promise that I’ll supply it
And when I’m out of town I’ll send my heart through the wire
Similar to Diane because girl you truly inspired
Me to go higher, me to go further
Your love got me huggin yo mama, thankin yo father
For makin an angel, I pray we never change so we can go overseas on the same boats
Probly go to the rainbow
Every day it gets better, forgive me bout my pride
Feels whenever we together
And if it’s ever rainin I’ll promise to change the weather
Even inside of out, make it flood in the drought

(Chorus: Tank)
I’mma keep it trill
And you ain’t gotta worry bout a damn thing, yea
Your brother’s on the loose
And everybody’s tryna get at you baby
But I’mma find your love and I’mma never let go
I’mma find your love and I’mma never let go

(Verse 3: Iamsu!)
Yea
First name Stunt, last name ball
Ain’t no freako I can’t call
Don’t like blunts, don’t like mugs
And I smoke weed but not like you
Niggas gon hate, bitch gon date
I bet that my bros be late
Like yourself bitch, this I know
So I hope we procreate
Got up in this record and did one thing… nominate
If it ain’t bout money homie then I can’t accommodate
It’s a cookout, I’mma stay with a paper plate
They think that I work for hoes
Just make sure all this cake I make
Young G, say what I want to
My kick game like kung fu
And if you think you shinin I might mess around and sell you
Eatin all these rappers, all that can’t hide I got this
Do a verse, buy some new Jordans
That’s what I call a mic check
Think I need my eye check, I can’t see nobody
All I do is faster but bitch this ain’t yo body
I mean hotels, some tells
How it feel – so real
I got no skills, I got pro skills
I got the coke float up, low fish scale

(Hook x2: Iamsu!)
Yea yea yea
I’m a playa
Granted I’m a millionaire
Yea yea yea
I’m a playa
Granted I’m a millionaire

(Verse 4: Iamsu!)
What it be like? What it gon do?
Never expect cuz I told you
Been about bread since ‘02
Want a hit, nigga I’m the go to
RIPD til I OD
I be low key for my OG
No justice, finna smoke piece
You ain’t care to see, you want no beef
See the mean boy, I’m a G boy
Keep soldiers like a B plug
I be ballin, you a cheap boy
Til you see boy, you a decoy
On the same court, on the beach boy
Please don’t bother me, boy
These rappers is my children, you know I follow this voice
Homie live it up, live it up
I killed this beat, finna dig it up
A small ball, golf ball you a big enough
Smoking something that will probably leave a nigga dumb
Flow sick as fuck, I linch it up
Like a phone call, nigga go hard
I’mma go yar by the wallet
I’m the hottest, that’s a promise
Thousands on garments, we represent the sea stunters
By my drama cheesy these artists is
Cookin dope for some carter shit
Please don’t call me Nino, I ain’t going down
Tell my city up another though yo boy in town
Hah!

(Hook x2: Iamsu)
Yea yea yea
I’m a playa
Granted I’m a millionaire
Yea yea yea
I’m a playa
Granted I’m a millionaire
