[Intro]
Yeah aye
HBK, yeah you know how we play
IamSu!

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
You don't wanna fall in love
Ima make you love me
We be mixing Jameson with the bubbly
You could be the wifey, you call me hubby
You noticed that my pockets are getting chubby
But you're still guarding you heart
You need to go let it go
Its heart break gang
But I won't break your's no
Way to young to settle down I know
Nothing last forever it's better
Let me show you

[Chorus: Anjali]
I'm too young to fall in love
I'm just here to have a good time
Why you wanna mess this up
Maybe I rather be alone
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love

[Verse: Anjali]
You're  a lame if you ain't getting cash
And you're always seen at home
Why you wanna be the first to cuff
When you ain't even got your own
I'm going out with my girls tonight
I can't even think about you
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love

[Chorus: Anjali]
I'm too young to fall in love
I'm just here to have a good time
Why you wanna mess this up
Maybe I rather be alone
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
Headed to the money, yeah we getting paid (money)

I love it when you text me and call me bae
Make me wanna get them other girls away aye
Leave the receipt she don't want them back
Her ex man old news, he an artifact
Heart Break Gang please don't have a heart attack
And she make me wanna sing I  don't wanna rap

[Chorus: Anjali]
I'm too young to fall in love
I'm just here to have a good time
Why you wanna mess this up
Maybe I rather be alone
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love

[Break: Anjali]
Let it go, let it go

No I can't I can't I can't fall in love

[Chorus: Anjali]

Why you wanna mess this up
Maybe I rather be alone
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love
No I can't I can't I can't fall in love
