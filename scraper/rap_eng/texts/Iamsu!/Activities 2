[Intro]
Even Ray Charles could see you got money
Yeah, yeah
Ju-ju-ju-ju-ju -June on the beat

[Hook: IamSU!]
I'm looking for the work, you know I gotta eat
I've been up all night like four days straight, man I swear I can't sleep
What you know about me?
Same clothes for 'bout a week
Fucking with a nigga like me
As where I'm from there's hella activities, yeah

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Freddie Gang laying in them cages
Real niggas, they ain't never made a statement
Chop stick chewing through your faces
Shooter fuckin' up, I'm in need of replacement
And we gon' shoot until the thing click
Under-roos and the same clique, I ain't change shit
Walk throughs, we gone walk up and bang shit
We famous for murder, these niggas know what my name is
Lane switchin' in Europe gettin' top and bottles
When I top, chop right nigga on my momma
We still eat top ramen, while we countin' commas
I sacrifice it all if it's for a dollar

[Hook: IamSU!]
I'm looking for the work, you know I gotta eat
I've been up all night like four days straight, man I swear I can't sleep
What you know about me?
Same clothes for 'bout a week
Fucking with a nigga like me
As where I'm from there's hella activities, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil' Goofy]
Kicked out at 14, what I'm supposed to do?
Cop the .22 to bundle up in my dude shoe
Not a wall of thunder in the northfade rain fit
Same clique I've been in with
Nigga lookin' for work, a nigga gotta eat
Say I (?)
Still I ain't been sleep
Trap a nigga lyin' on me
Mozzy Memeber Music, Bladadah
I'm only fuckin' with her if she rock until she ride or die
My area divided and a unity
Thug did slang got to ask her what she do to me
These drugs are nothin' new to me
But shit ain't what it used to be
I'm flexin' on whoever envy and turn them to my enemy

[Hook: IamSU!]
I'm looking for the work, you know I gotta eat
I've been up all night like four days straight, man I swear I can't sleep

[Verse 3: June]
I'm really from a place you can't go
Ask these niggas round me they know
I keep a shooter with me, he don't go
If it's four niggas then it's four guns in one load
We count the amount of  barrels
Whatcu lookin' foh?
Slapped her in her mouth, where's your speakerphone?
I can't lie cause earlier I been geeking on ya
Ride around with .50 cal, we call it Zilla-Zo
She don't get them bands off the stripper pole
Turning round and round like a loose bulb
My niggas got work, movin' packs though
The plug don't give a better price then we gon' (?)

[Hook: IamSU!]
