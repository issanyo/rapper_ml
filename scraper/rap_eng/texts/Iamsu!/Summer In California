[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
So G, it's me, LBC
The turf by the surf and you can sail with me
Palm trees, policies, a lotta weed
We got just what you want, oh batabing
So if you out here by my way
In sunny Cali-Forn-I-A
Oh yeah, this is DPG
Now you can catch a little heat from my girl Sweet P

[Verse 2: Paloma Ford]
Hear them say that, I be single
I'll be single by the summer time
I done fell in love
You're the only one
You're the only one my mind
The way you do it like that make me wanna come right back
The way I do it like that, DJ betta run this back

[Chorus]
Oh baby, somethin' bout your love it drives me crazy
Like a summer in California
Oh baby, somethin' bout your love it drives me crazy
Like a summer in California

[Bridge]
You got what I need
Your love take me to ecstasy
Rollin' with me, we can do anything on your mind
The way you do it like that make me wanna come right back
The way I do it like that, DJ betta run this back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Iamsu!]
I'm West Coast, rich city, up top chillin'
Put a plate together, plottin' on a million
Drivin' these women crazy like summer in LA
Then bounce up to the Bay where they love HB to the K
I was like three watchin' Snoop up on the screen
Like I'mma do this, uck workin' for the team
Now I'm long hair, don't care, everywhere, on the grind
All the time poppin' like Cali in the summer time

[Chorus]
