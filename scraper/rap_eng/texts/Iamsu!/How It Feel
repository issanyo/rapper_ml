[Intro]
Bang, bang, you doin' your thing
Tell me how it feel, aye
Aye!

[Hook: IamSu!]
You doin' your thing, man you doin' your thing
Tell me how it feel
You got Cuban-link chains, you got diamonds in your grill
And you always with that gang, you got all your niggas with 'em
How it feel, how it feel, can you tell me how it feel?
Aye!

[Post-Hook: IamSu!]
You can tell they ain't checkin' my piss, aye
Smokin'  most potent weed that exists, HBK gang came to mack your bitch
She for sure comin' back with the clique, aye
We runnin' numbers like calculus
All of my figures be accurate

[Verse 1: J.R. Donato]
Sippin' on Actavis, niggas can't practice this
Got bands where that mattress is
These hoes wanna tackle me
Shorty wanna know how I do it
Grab me a dip and I'm shootin' a movie
Two Styrofoams and the signature doobie
Gettin' my dough and I'm keepin' it movin'
Sip out the pint, I might make me a smoothie
It ain't 'bout money, you losin'
I put your man where the news be
Finish him up with the two-piece
Coppin' them J's on the road
Nigga I skate in them Van's
Might put the Bimmer on fours
Boy what the fuck is you sayin'?
Pull up in 'Vettes, back to back and all of 'em tinted
Blow some melodic the shit you ain't seen in a minute
Tats on my body I pull up in something that's tinted
It's just how I feel, my nigga, this just how I feel
Hey

[Hook] [Post-Hook]

[Verse 2]
Go run up the numbers, came with bands in my pocket
Tossin' me up with a model, boy why your salad so sloppy?
I don't know, that is the gwop
One in the head, I won't cock it
He got hit hit up from the corner,  he got hit up with it on him
We that [?] come in from the back
Know that I stay with the sack
Bitches got they got a wife and a nigga knows
Soon as I come in with the pack
I ain't even tryin' to see no centerfolds, bitch I'm just lettin' it stack
Sellin' quarters about to pee up in this ho
Turn up, ain't tryin' to relax
Tell me somethin' is them really hundreds?
Oklahoma, I could ball for Thunder
Bossin' up I never been a runner
Where the money finna [?] do somethin', my niggas is sleezy
We doin' our thing
We doin' our thing, makin' it look easy
We sippin' that drink
Might hop up in the Benz or the Range, uhh

[Hook] [Post-Hook]

[Outro: J.R. Donato]
Tell me somethin' is them really hundreds?
Oklahoma, I could ball for Thunder
Bossin' up I never been a runner
Where the money finna [?] do somethin', my niggas is sleezy
We doin' our thing
We doin' our thing, makin' it look easy
We sippin' that drink
Might hop up in the Benz or the Range, uhh!
