[Verse 1: Jay Ant]
I'm paper chasin', why you pay for racin'?
This ain't no race, if you gon' get it, you gotta be patient
Why y'all be trippin'? You know me, I chill like whatever
If it's gon', it's gon' happen, so it's whatever
Look I'm coming for the top so get yo shit together
Cause I'm hot like when the sun is beamin' on yo lever
Get it back, come with three hundred niggas like a Spartan
Tell em I got juice like a carton
Talkin' that shit I beg you pardon
You ain't gon' finish but you startin'
Juicy fruit, I got that flavor, I don't do no favors
Cause favors never end up with me ever getting paper
I learned that from my father, shout out to my father
All I know is real cause that's the way that I was brought up
I keep it real with these bosses, you don't never see me caught up
Too far on these niggas, I can never see y'all part up
On the road like 3.0, straight about that five-one-O
All these niggas know what's up, they just act like they don't know

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
My name is S-U-Explanation, I be movin', they be hatin'
Probably mad cause no-one listens they be makin'
Get that dough and chill, I live that live like so for real
It's candy rain I can't be tanned, she can not help a closer deal
Like a contract, I get it, if I want that
I'm sippin' on that bombay, so high I might lose contact
Like a drop car, boss men, shot call
She fuckin' with them real niggas, and it's not y'all
Ah, I'm getting head like a car light
I'm from the Rich and you'll get dealt with if the card's right
My bitch just star tight, we live that Mars live
Her pussy tighter than a grip and her jugs tight
I'm the man, Kobe Bryant's who I ball like
A recon ball's exactly what I hit the mall like
HBK Gang, yeah we all tight
Hittin' hard as cannon balls on the concrete
