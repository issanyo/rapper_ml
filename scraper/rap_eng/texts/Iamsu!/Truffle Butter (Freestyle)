[Intro}
Yeah
Huh?
Let's get it
HBK yeah you know how we play

Uh uh uh

[Hook]
Thinking out loud
Ima need a million fucking dollars right now
Ain't nothing change, man the name still the same
And the way I play the game people know it ain't a game
That's ironic ain't it?
Now everybody trying to meet the boy
I'm always fitted, in my closet like a sneaker store
Get her started even if I gotta key the car
Game sick enough to get a dancer out her leotard
Question
Nicki can I eat it though?
Can I fuck you in the backseat of your vehicle?
Tell me secrets about the game just for me to know
And when they bring me up say I'm some shit they never seen before
Super duper flow, Super duper style
Fuck around and go pop like I'm Super Duper Kyle
Scratching on me saying "Susi do it do it now."
I'm so deep inside her mouth that I could do a root canal
Been raw, ODB with it, uh
Probably see me on T.V. with it, yeah
Let me hit it, let Freak hit it
Make the money so fast they should let me print it
