Nigga, that's on mammas, on mammas
Nigga, I be counting hunnits, hunnits
Then they said they want problems, problems

I don't think they really want it, want it

This the shit that wake the neighbors up, every day I be baking up
Need the head when I'm waking up, yeah, it's time to get enough
You road lanes, we can get it all, take a sit, nigga, sit it down
Young kali hop boy, young President Barack boy
Can't stop, won't stop, boy, taking off, it's time to blow
Try to shine like a pot a gold, money caught and I got to go
Get it and I got to show, you shot a friend and you turn it out
We the niggas you still learn about, better you concern about
Paper boy on a paper route, I'm from where they don't make it down
Young, wild and ignorant, you know I'm my nigga's militant
Favorite boy like an immigrant, they can say is one to ten
I'll be high, I'll be hela bent, to a broke bitch I'm celibate

Nigga, that's yo mammas, yo mammas
Nigga, I be counting hunnits, hunnits
Then they said they want problems, problems
I don't think they really want it, want it
Nigga, that's yo mammas, yo mammas
Nigga, I be counting hunnits, hunnits
Then they said they want problems, problems
I don't think they really want it, want it

She don't smoke, I'm a make her puff
Move pounds of that laker stuff
Pills, you dont take enough, green backs, she don't make enough
Service shake, yeah, you quaking up
About to leave regular, squares dice, see you shakin up
Hell gang, niggas papered up, and I ain't talking no book
A flow like when the cold cook, feeling wavy like the boat shook
Where my little writers at, she nail chain and the tire at
Two X L nigga whole body back, don't lie, check the polygraph
On the molly rath, I fuck this bitch, yeah, you're probably mad
Cause I rap like a body cas, everybody there
Keep grinding to every nigga in my squaty fare
My bitches bout to kick it, they karate hands
We dug in, work off, no body here

Nigga, that's on mammas, on mammas
Nigga, I be counting hunnits, hunnits
Then they said they want problems, problems
I don't think they really want it, want it
Nigga, that's yo mammas, yo mammas
Nigga, I be counting hunnits, hunnits
Then they said they want problems, problems
I don't think they really want it, want it

I be in the Bay though, on bread like mayo
Cause I'm always on the jayo, you soft like Play-doh
And me I'm hard body, hard body
Better stay out of my way, though
Please keep it dumb real, feeling just like the one feel
Hungry I ain't had one meal and I keep it dumb trail
All these niggas signing record deals
Seeing me I need two meals
But I ain't need a signed yet, all you niggas smoking dime sex
You ain't hard, where your line at?
See my nigga shit turned up
Cali weed gettin burnt up?
Man, I thought she would've learn, bro
We ain't funna fall tho, time's sweet at the Waldorf
Say its beef and get called off, better pay attention
I'm the one they should mention
Gold chain it be glistenin huh

Nigga, that's yo mammas
