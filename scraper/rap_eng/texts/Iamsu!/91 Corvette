[Intro: Iamsu!]

Uh
Right
HBK, yeah you know how we play
This sound like, top down in the Corvette
'89, '91
Uh

[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
Let me tell a little story about a ‘G’
2002 or maybe 2003
Six foot Mack with a knack for the funk
Supply the bass for your face in the trunk
I compose the beat, write the rap and I snap
And if the check bounce, the promoter get slapped
Cause there ain’t no faking when it comes to my dividends
Wake up in the morning and I stretch out my ligaments
Came from the rich, raised with respect
Momma was a teacher so I always came correct
Now we in effect, hopping off a jet
With some light work, two chains on my neck
I dress to impress, I don’t smoke the sessameal
Always keep the paper feel
Reefer give me sex appeal
Please unwind, and go and hope on this ride
With the greatest of all time
(Huh)

[Verse 2: Dave Steezy]
How I look at it you aren’t supposed to stunt
Prior to me rolling this I smoked a joint, yeah
And that’s exactly why my eyes red
Stoner nigga that's addicted to all this high-end shit
And the money’s probably all I need
But I won’t stop until I’m dead like [?]
Smoking fire and half of these niggas liars
I just try to everything I can to remain a 'G'
And bet I rock Mookey, bet caught babe
Bet I roll a doobie up and smoke it to their face
I with my niggas every day and we ain’t do a lot of playing
We just get into the money better listen what I’m saying
Young shmop legend, will I stop? Never
And when them new yeezys drop I’m trying to cop 7
No lie, I kill them with style, they feelin' me now, like Iamsu’s is, im too sick, super half, too lit
(Oo)

[Verse 3: Jay Ant]
This ain’t the life that we chose, it’s the life that chose us
They tell us cuz we rap, we need our neck all froze up
But not I, start a hurricane if I fly by
I’m that fly, it’s the B I G, pimping like I’m hover
Even my mamma drive a range rover
Me sober? Nah nigga, I'm 3 high
If you don’t smoke, you shouldn’t ride how we ride
California chillin’ cuz we got the best wee-ahd
Yup, me and my niggas smoke
And remember you don’t smoke if you too afraid to choke
High as ceiling, go A-team, like a Chilean, mind on a million, and finished, isn’t it?
(Yeh)

[Verse 4: Kool John]
Is you are, is you ain’t
Man I’m on the road to the top, I can’t wait
And I’m in the clique for the grinders, my team straight
I’m from the home of the players but niggas love to hate
You act like all I wanna do is zoom-zoom in your boom-boom
When I come, girl you come too
Yea we grown-ups who doing what we wanna do
Like write raps about things that we gonna do
Like have a house on the hill that’s a stunner’s view
Like probably cop a couple cars and have a hundred shoes
I’mma ask, watch her buns, love her booty, hella too
I’m shmop livin’ and I’m doin’ what I wanna do

I’m ducking suckas, busting nuts, making business moves
It’s hot out, top down, feet up out the coupe
I hit the spot get the money then I ‘skrrrt’ out
I pull bitches and ain’t even gotta work out
(Ehk!)

[Outro: P-Lo]
What up mane
Y’all ain’t fuckin with these young niggas mane
The game will never be the same
The game is to be sold, and not to be told, my brothaah
And I’m out

One love
