[Hook: IamSu!]
We don't like broke bitches
We don't like brown weed
Stay up out of my business
You don't know about me
We don't like broke bitches
We don't like brown weed
Stay up out of my business
You don't know about me

[Verse 1: Jay Ant]
I'm rarer than unicorn hair
Get more back than lawn chairs
How we do it it's not fair
But I do not give a fuck I don't care
Bitch I'm a player ho
Shout to my nigga Roach
I been playing so long fucking I should probably just be a coach
You should see how I run the play
I can't help it I'm from the Bay
That's the only way I was raised
That's the only was I was laced
Tell her run it huh, but this ain't a race
I'm drinking Jameson straight bitch I don't need a chase
If she ain't fucking with me then I ain't finna chase
I'm just trying to pentrate I told her let me demonstrate
What's happening
I'm ready for whatever we counting feti together
Bitch I'm smooth as new leather get on your head like New Era
Fly niggas without feathers
And we only move the cheddar uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2: IamSu]
I'm stranger, blessed like Christ in a manger
Anger bottled up on me, created a company
Heart Break collision all state
Potentially failing, a risk that we all take
A criminal mind state is what these rappers got
And when it comes to money, I think I spend a lot
Rot, in hell if you hating I'm from the home of the
Raiders A's and the Giants Black Panthers and many more
I remember when, I was plenty poor
Made my life to a thick bitch from a skinny whore
More present than Christmas
All this hate I will dismiss
Disable like pop-ups, no money you lost us
You steady selling your soul that's cause it don't cost much
Watch them fall off like Mufasa

[Lion King sample]
