Intro)
Bounce so I could get all of it
Other shit
Real shit
Uh

(Verse 1: Iamsu)
Chillin with my homie tryna make a way
Comparing my whereabouts to roamin wouldn’t take a day
They hatin, I can’t complain
I got it good
I been in top floor suites out in Hollywood
Reminiscin bout it but we still got a way to go
Learnin and building off the mistakes that we made before
I pay my roll, man sacrifice is in all this shit
Turned a piece down just so I could see all of it
School of Hard Knox, I attended on scholarship
Worked for so many years, never getting acknowledgement
So while through the worrying, I’m just thinking big and better
Got a circle of real homies that’s down for whatever
Workin like I'm enslaved til my name is engraved
In that walk of fame, gold sparkling
Find the passion and turn into an assassin
A month of competition of us strayin from the invasion

(Chorus)
Why don’t you sing for me?
The song to the key of life (song to the key of life)
Why don’t you sing for me?
Yea yea
The song to the key of life (song to the key of life)

(Verse 2: Jay Ant)
Ballin like 2-3, magic like 3-2
Niggas say we outchea but we don’t never see you
You niggas must be see through, blowin up like C2
Plus 2, bless you, your bitch was ready for me
Before I even met you, you talkin down on me
Just don’t let me catch you, drop it
Ain’t nobody comin here to catch you
A wise man told me don’t ever get too thrown if ain’t nobody there to fetch you
Stop me? man I can’t let you
Gotta be hot but I can’t sweat you
These niggas do anything for attention
Uh, sayin many things to be mentioned
Uh, and I’m from another dimension
I’m nothing like you preachers
Uh, stay on track like your bleachers
On the highest mountain, nigga still couldn’t reach us

(Chorus)
Why don’t you sing for me?
The song to the key of life (song to the key of life)
Why don’t you sing for me?
Yea yea
The song to the key of life (song to the key of life)
Yea yea

(Verse: CJ)
I’m dreamin to blow that reafer, life got me over here
Learnin while I’m earnin in the west to play the teacher
But I won’t get what I deserve, home boy my spot is reserved
They told me life’s a bitch, will I finally get to meet her?
Probably get in ya speaker, come and lead this here
But permanently I’m what they yearnin to see
Now everybody wanna talk, it ain’t important to me
I’m in a different lane, can’t nobody merge with me
You B hit me only cuz she got the urge to see
I’m bout a dollar, I’m bout a dollar
I swear I’m is
But bright lights make a nigga little nervous
Pay attention to the niggas who I swerve with
I got the key to the life and I’mma splurge ya
Uh
The same niggas who I’m smoking on this earth with
The same niggas I leave earth with

(Chorus)
Why don’t you sing for me?
The song to the key of life (song to the key of life)
Why don’t you sing for me?
Yea yea
The song to the key of life (song to the key of life)
Yea yea
