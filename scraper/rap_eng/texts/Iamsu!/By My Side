[Hook]
Walk straight out my dream, like there she is
How can I make you my chick
I like you better by my side
I truly believe, that you the shit
And when they try, I'm who you hit
I be the first one down to ride
You know that I got you (like you got me)
You're just like a tattoo (more than skin deep)
You know that I got you (like you got me)
You're just like a tattoo (more than skin deep)

[Verse 1]
I want a woman with some boundaries
Keep the vibes up, keep the lames away from 'round me
Got a body way more than a little bit
A true friend with some benefits
I'm on a hunt for you
Flying in every month for you
Out of all them other dudes, I'm the one for you
We connect on a different level
I love how she got her shit together, I got respect for you
Got a suite, got a bottle to the neck for you
Sugar daddies prolly trynna write a check for you
Got a cool conversation, you spot a true from a fake one, and I see you

[Hook]
Walk straight out my dream, like there she is
How can I make you my chick
I like you better by my side
I truly believe, that you the shit
And when they try, I'm who you hit
I be the first one down to ride
You know that I got you (like you got me)
You're just like a tattoo (more than skin deep)
You know that I got you (like you got me)
You're just like a tattoo (more than skin deep)

[Verse 2]
I know that you need someone to trust
Come through in a clutch
Digging your perspective and I'm not here to judge
You need special treatment when you come in the club
Baby girl, I know you wanna ride with me
Wanna pull up to a show and spend time with me
You just wanna catch a vibe from me, yeah
But you cannot get this vibe for free, no
Stack chips like casinos
Rarris and them Lambs, we need those
If you liking these goals
Come on baby, let's go

[Hook]
Walk straight out my dream, like there she is
How can I make you my chick
I like you better by my side
I truly believe, that you the shit
And when they try, I'm who you hit
I be the first one down to ride
You know that I got you (like you got me)
You're just like a tattoo (more than skin deep)
You know that I got you (like you got me)
You're just like a tattoo (more than skin deep)
Walk straight out my dream, like there she is
How can I make you my chick
I like you better by my side
I truly believe, that you the shit
And when they try, I'm who you hit
I be the first one down to ride
You know that I got you (like you got me)
You're just like a tattoo (more than skin deep)
You know that I got you (like you got me)
You're just like a tattoo (more than skin deep)
