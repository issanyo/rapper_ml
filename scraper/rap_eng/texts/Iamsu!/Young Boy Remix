[Intro: IamSu]
Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Can you dig it

[Pre-Hook: IamSu]
I just wanna put my pride to the side but it's hard for me
I'm so happy I got God on my side cause he watching me

[Bridge: IamSu]
And everywhere I go I be on the same ol' same ol' same
And everywhere I go I be on the same ol' same ol' same

[Hook: IamSu & 0ne5Manibo]
Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Civic

[Verse: 0ne5Manibo]
Young boy really outside, on that one five
Slide through, you not cool, you're a dumb guy
I was only nine when I learned to add it up
I don't play with talkers, need some sixers on the truck
I got people looking up to me, I gotta do it right
I just want my family out the hood and we sleep good at night
My pop used to bust knocks by the civic
Hustle with my bloods, so you know I gotta get it

[Hook: 0ne5Manibo]
Young boy, really on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
0ne5 really in this bitch

[Hook: IamSu]
Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic

[Bridge: 0ne5Manibo]
And everywhere I go I be on the same ol' same ol' same
And everywhere I go I be on the same ol' same ol' same
