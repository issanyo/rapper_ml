[Verse 1: IamSU!]
I don't walk through the front no more
Let me and all my niggas through the back
Girl you ain't gotta front no more
When you see me you know you don't know how to act
I'm a heartbreak gangsta
And I'm one of the realest niggas in the world
And you know that I'm a bachelor
Leave her alone, you know I'm goin to take yo girl
Switch up baby, work that body like a 9 to 5
Talk bout money, we seein' eye to eye
Had one way back up, but no valley high
And the way I'm ballin, call me Allen Eye
First I'm comin up at the risin'
Stand up, what is this the surprise?
Said I'm the realest one rhyming
Since we gots to blow right by 'em
No lyin, niggas be playin but they can't keep up
Nice but, D cups, that's what keeps me up

[Pre-Hook:]

And you hate it, but don't folla, and she shakin'

[Hook:]

Girl work that shit, girl work that shit
Girl work that shit, girl work that shit
Girl work that shit, girl work that shit

Uh, I've been in here for hella years
Bloodshed and the tears, uh
My family came from the Riches, yep
I only came for the bitches, uh
And I don't fuck around with snitches, uh
Best believe they get stitches
Or fuck around and die, nigga I'm fly, yep
And I ain't never had to lie, uh
Why would I only want a slice?
When I could have the whole pie
Yep! Real nigga what's happenin'?

Smoking loud, my nigga brought the whole package, yeah

[Pre-Hook:]

Girl work that shit, girl work that shit
Girl work that shit, girl work that shit

[Verse 3: Mike-Dash-E]
Work it like a pro
Baby fuck me like an athelete
Know I'm getting bucks like my middle name Cashcrete
You ain't gotta asks, except for young girl I'm past it
You hit that pussy once and pass her off like bitch you last week
Go 'head and holla at the kid, holla at the man
I'm throwin up my 3, I'm rappin 3 up every track
Middle finger to these haters tryna plot, on me back
Why you busy speakin' on me? I proceed to check these racks
Ooooh, you forgot me, I'm a wake you up
My name been ringin' since the day's up
Turn around, turn around, ain't no breakin' up
Busy ridin' dollar, stayin' far away from takin' fucks
Now it's time to take my cut, everything you put in bricks
Money money money, all I'm seein' in my vision stuck
Prophecy position, intuition never changing up
Like every day my work, man I'm takin' up

[Pre-Hook:]

[Hook:]
AYE!
