[Verse 1]
I'm the man, flyer than a paper plane
You niggas playing, if you dont know HBK the gang
Hit the club, hit the stage, I don't make it rain
But I'm young and get money, so I can't complain
I do what I want, I don't really really care
And I let my duck tail bang like I forgot to cut my hair
I am S U exclamation on that Gucci [?]
I make her drop it to the floor and keep her booty in the air
There's some junk up in your trunk, baby do you got a spare
And the way you move is crazy, I dont think that youre aware
Treat my ladies like my Jordans, yeah, I like them by the pair
I got them hanging in my crib just like a freaking chandelier
Swag stupid, I should put a helmet on me
And I'm always touching cheese like some pepperoni
On some new shit, I need a pamper on me
HBK Gang, bitch stamp it on me, Su

[Hook]
I got em going, I got em going
I got em going, going crazy
I got em going, I got em going
I got em going, going crazy
Got em' going crazy, going crazy
Got em' going crazy, going crazy
Got em' going crazy, going crazy
Got em' going crazy, going crazy

[Verse 2]
Niggas know us
No money you got nothing for us
And homie all I do is gas like a Ford Explorer
President, yeah I'm the one they voted for
Cause I just hit the stage, and crank it like I'm Soulja Boy
Self-employed, might fuck around and buy you
Fuck one, cause I need the entire crew
It's IamSu, nigga tell me what u trynna do
Getting money, I might fuck around and buy you
On a realer, my mama think that I am a dealer
Ace flow to a common cold, I am iller
Niggas talking, but I dont really pay attention
Too busy balling, plus I know I could take they bitches
And take some pictures, blog about it and then forget it
One of the realest, about a Richmond can pay a visit
Look how I did it, even got them out of towners with it
Thats why I got them going crazy bro look how we did it

[Hook]
I got em going, I got em going
I got em going, going crazy
I got em going, I got em going
I got em going, going crazy
Got em' going crazy, going crazy
Got em' going crazy, going crazy
Got em' going crazy, going crazy
Got em' going crazy, going crazy
