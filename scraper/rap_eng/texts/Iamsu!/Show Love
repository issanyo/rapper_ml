[Intro: P-Lo]
P-P-P-Lo, bring the bass back

[Hook: Chris Miles]
Whem I'm on the road, you know they show love
And when I come home, better know they show love
No matter where I go, you know they show love
East coast, west coast, better know they show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love

[Verse 1: Chris Miles]
I know what they want from me, I don't even turn my celly on
The hate it now, I'm really on, everybody talks 'til they see bucks I'm gettin' on
According to TMZ, I just made a million, like, what?
Hundred deal-o, I got P-Lo on the beat
And from the east coast to the west side I got fans I wanna meet
I got Suzy spittin' heat, he'll kill this shit
I don't want a whip, man, I'm tryna cop a dealdership
Real as shit, iight, voice high like I'm Young Thug
Tryna put my dogs in the crib like a drug bust
I'm [?] with the new shit
Back when they was doubtin', I was flowing like a cruise ship
And now I cruise it, I can't believe it now
The world's mine, yeah, I think I'm gettin' greedy now
I need a crown, yeah I know that I deserve it man
I did it for all of my people, don't worry ever because it was worth it
Chris Miles

[Hook: Chris Miles & Iamsu!]
Whem I'm on the road, you know they show love
And when I come home, better know they show love

East coast, west coast, better know they show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
Suzy Six Speed, just made history
Put my city on the TV, my homies with me
Heartbreaks, my life, tatted on my hand too
I don't see no stop signs, nothin' that I can't do
Chris Miles with styles, every song he get it in
Any city, any state, tour-bus printed van
I'm pullin' up and they showin' love
They poor shots and they rollin' up
I got the stimuli to sun up, my million dollar persona
Got bitches itchin' to fiend it, they peel they clothes off to nada
Forty-four jamas to show these haters that I got it
They say that they gettin' paper, they bank accounts in the minus
They know it's gold when I write it, I got the touch like I'm Midus
So high I could be a pilot, I do it, you read about it, ayy
So please don't get it twisted, I guarantee that I can get you what you're missin'

[Hook: Chris Miles & Iamsu!]
Whem I'm on the road, you know they show love
And when I come home, better know they show love
No matter where I go, you know they show love
East coast, west coast, better know they show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Fetty show you to curve your [?]
A lot of bad bitches rollin' mine up
Eat the remy up, whichever I want
Fetty Wap on a nigga other song
Man the other plug used to be a [?]
Run up on my boys, watch your step punk
All the Zoo got money, this ain't luck
And I ask this every other song
If you show with me, I'mma put 'em up
All my niggas got me
Diamonds actin' rocky
Pistol for my sidepiece
Zoo, we keep a dime piece
I bring a bag of [?]
So I know you like me
Can I get you icy?
Won't you ever try me
Welcome to the Zoo gang
Watch just how we do things
'Bout to let her do things
Fixing up my shoe strings
Then we onto new things

[Hook: Chris Miles]
Whem I'm on the road, you know they show love
And when I come home, better know they show love
No matter where I go, you know they show love
East coast, west coast, better know they show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
Show love for the youngin', show love
