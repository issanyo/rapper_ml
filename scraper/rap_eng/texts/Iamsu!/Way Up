[Hook: AD]
Club going down, tell ‘em turn me way up
Way, way up
When I’m in your town tell ‘em turn me way up
Way, way up
Way up, way up
Way, way, way up
Way up, way up
Way, way, way up

[Verse 1: AD]
Woah, woah, way up
We be goin’ hard, why you tryna play us?
All about the money, tell a nigga pay up
You can’t even buy the bar, nigga get your cake up
Lil nigga it get real out here, wake up
Got to say a prayer every day I wake up
Side bitch in my ear, says she wanna break up
Main bitch in the bed, tell her don’t wait up
Keep her face clean, I don’t do the makeup
And if the bitch leave I don’t do the make-ups
Everybody hate, I ain’t never changed up
Went and dropped a couple niggas, had to get my change up
Got to ball hard, nigga that’s a layup
And if the pussy bomb I’ma have to lay up
Tell me time is money, don’t you ever take up
All these niggas fell off but they taking pay cuts

[Hook: AD]
Club going down, tell ‘em turn me way up
Way, way up
When I’m in your town tell ‘em turn me way up
Way, way up
Way up, way up
Way, way, way up
Way up, way up
Way, way, way up

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Way, way, way, way up
Hold up AD, this shit too easy, it’s a layup
Yeah, and I’m the one who brought the Bay up
It's fucking hoes from Rodéo with shopping sprees in Rodéo now
Yeah, and I got big big plans
Millions, billions, trillions
Kick the fake out, bring the real in
I’m taking trips out where they spend yen
And that’s China, all I know is designer
Making money my major but macking hoes is my minor
And now I’m hotter than 400 degrees
You gon’ run them bands up if you running with me
And ain’t nothing for free, everything got a price tag
5k for the fit, that’s a light dab
Running numbers in my head cause I like math
Now bring it right back, kick it like I’m Mike Jackson

[Hook: AD]
Club going down, tell ‘em turn me way up
Way, way up
When I’m in your town tell ‘em turn me way up
Way, way up
Way up, way up
Way, way, way up
Way up, way up
Way, way, way up

[Outro: AD]
Way up
Way, way, way up
Way up
Way, way, way up
Way up
Way, way, way up
Way up
Way, way, way up
