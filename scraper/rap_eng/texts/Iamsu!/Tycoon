[INTRO]:
$$$
Playeristic vibes

[Hook]:
Slide thru there I'm a young tycoon
And that's why they watch all my moves
She told me she like to ride too
Ay girl I just might grow to like you
Yeh
I got money on me, I can do what I wanna
She gave me the word, Imma do what I wanna
Power moves I go bust that's what I wanna
Real niggas do real things, that be what I wanna

[VERSE 1]:
This shit tastes A1, I mixed it with both
Saucin' on you man I feel like I'm post
I'm in the building I feel like a host
Know that I came thru with somebody
Leave out with more
Yeh
Rolled a smoke out in the O
Gotta smoke out in the O
Rolling out the O
They don't know they don't really smoke
Yeh
I'm at the point I can't turn back I just ride
I'm right infront of the dolla $ign like Ty
Hyped like LXD, trap booming no lie
She was dead, but is back alive
I had to revive
She tryna get me outta my clothes
Bay shit know I stay lit with my woes

[Hook]:
Slide thru there I'm a young tycoon
And that's why they watch all my moves
She told me she like to ride too
Ay girl I just might grow to like you
Yeh
I got money on me, I can do what I wanna
She gave me the word, Imma do what I wanna
Power moves I go bust that's what I wanna
Real niggas do real things, that be what I wanna

[VERSE 2]:
Only loud pak$ when I smoke
Yeh, I handle my buisness then I go
Yeh, I ain't got time to spend with nigga broke
I'm timeless like my watch broke
Yeh
Rollin up all of this snow
Out with my bros
Yeh, we on the hold
She look at me you know how it goes
Look how they fit,  got them tailored
They think I'm back and got these flavours
My style level exceeded maximum
Quality is sure, that's why I crack for it
Ask for it, Ashe with it, that's why I hit that
Mobbin' all around I live fast
But if money calling...

[Hook]:
Slide thru there I'm a young tycoon
And that's why they watch all my moves
She told me she like to ride too
Ay girl I just might grow to like you
Yeh
I got money on me, I can do what I wanna
She gave me the word, Imma do what I wanna
Power moves I go bust that's what I wanna
Real niggas do real things, that be what I wanna

[OUTRO]:
Yeh, this life style is consistent
About my bread, yadadimean?
