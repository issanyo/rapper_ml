[Intro]
Yeah, uh huh, yeah
Yeah, uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm acting different, I got money now
I got different tastes, had to switch my style
Made 200 thou, that was 20 days
Want to leave, fuck it I ain't like her anyway
I'm in the black bat, these niggas lack swag
The hater took a toll on me, need the fast track
Fuck slowing down, they tell me take my time
The Huracan and that McClaren, I can't make my mind
I got the city hot, I took too many shots
She lucky if she get some mo'fucking Jack in the Box
She told me low bar at the top then I'm jacking the spot
All the people said they with me, they actually not
I made Paneau hot, I made the Rich cool
You twitter finger hating on me that's a bitch move
You niggas laugh behind my back, but now the jokes on you
Pause don't move
All foreign shit, no old schools

[Hook]
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, biotch
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, s'all I know is
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, s'all I know is
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, biotch

[Verse 2]
Fuck y'all, I'mma get my shit back
Yeah, don't ask me where your bitch at
Yeah, don't ask me where that money is
The way I hustle I be straight for like a hundred years
I'm the general, salute me or I'll commandeer
Can't find a common ground with you, because you niggas squares
Talk about these situations because I've been there
Off-white 1's, I need 10 pairs
I'm getting green like John Deer
Rap like [?]
Suzy just switch into gear
Don't make it difficult
Shoot me the resididual
If you are in debt, I'm at your neck just like a physicial
A motherfucking genius
Hopping out that clean whip
HD diamonds on me, need to throw me on your Zenith
Right now I need Mayweather racks
I'm the best, ain't no changing from that

[Hook]
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, biotch
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, s'all I know is
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, s'all I know is
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, biotch
