[Intro]
Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Can you dig it

[Pre-Hook]
I just wanna put my pride to the side but it's hard for me
I'm so happy I got God on my side cause he watching me

[Hook]
Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
No stock on the semi

[Pre-Hook]
Tryna put my pride to the side but it's hard for me
I'm so happy I got God on my side cause he watching me

[Bridge]
And everywhere I go I be on the same ol' same ol' same
And everywhere I go I be on the same ol' same ol' same

[Hook]
Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
Young boy, out here on the block tryna get it
Big bands on me, and my watch cost a ticket
I just wanna get my pops out the Civic
