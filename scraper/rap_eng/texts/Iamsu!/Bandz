Bitch, I need bandz
You hear me?
Bitch, I need bandz
You hear me?
Bitch, I need bandz
I need bandz, I need bandz, I need bandz
I need bandz, I need bandz, I need bandz
Yeah, bitch I need bandz
You hear me?
Uh, bitch I need bandz

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Real mack, I do this when I wanna
Knock your bitch in a Benz or a Honda
She said a man ain't a hunter
And if it ain't a hundred I don't want it
I see 'em in my Instagram comments
Bet I make these haters sick 'til they vomit
All family, no friends
Fuck with me, you wanna win
Go to work, go to work on 'em
Finna go crazy, go berzerk on 'em
Aye, had to run my check up
Only time I take a L is in a Lexus
Sippin' brown got me flexed up
And my OG say I'm next up
Take her to the room, pull her dress up
Bitch, you need bandz to impress us

Young Sensei, muy caliente
She say I'm a player, huh? That's what her friends say
Hella bands, got like noodles and shrimp
You don't want my shit, bananas like a chimp
I chase the bread not the bitch
If she wanna see broke, I see rich
If she wanna see fly, I see fall
Tell lil' baby let me ball, let me ball
Let's make a bet I get a bitch and get a check
Get a game and get a pussy, that's a threat
Loaded, I be lit
If you hatin' on me, you a bitch
Look how much work, I got work, I got work
Like twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
Look how much work, I got work, I got work
Like twerk, twerk, twerk
