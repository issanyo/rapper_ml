[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
Uh

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Pull up stuntin', no double for me
I heard there was niggas out looking for me
King gone aim it out the trouble for me
Pimpin'
Hoes only feed, barny rubber for me, yeah
King Of The Hill like FX
HBK the gang, now we up next
M.O.B. money that's the subject
I finna slam game like a suplex
I'm the nigga where I'm from, like the suburbs
Once heard niggas hate on me
Got some nerve
Use to be the one chasing young skurs
Now they  the niggas paying for a dumb verse
Uh
How 'bout your bitch like a  birthday
I'm in your girl mouth, that's my birth place
Got the juice like Pac and you thirsty
Give me brain like Clance ???


[Verse 2: P-Lo]
P-Lo make a ho do a somersault
So high imma take her whole summer off
My ho click bustin' like a gun revolve
Wanna get up in her rim, her clothes comin' off
Uh
Back in this bitch like yee
She on one i'm on three
I don't speak to police
Shmop life and Kool John , my OG
Make a girl do whatever I want
Getting paid everyday, like the first of the month
Uhhh
They don't do it like me,no
I could take your wifey,bro
No I'm never hatin', no they know my blood
If I say a bad bitch I'm gonna say wassup
Young P-Lo never gave her fun
HBK the gang, yeah we coming up
