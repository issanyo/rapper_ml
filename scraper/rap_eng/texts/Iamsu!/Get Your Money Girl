Baby drop them panties, making money, stackin plenty
All these hoes wanna fuck me, real niggas understand me
Hold it down for my gudda, ass hustlin motherfuckers
All my niggas trynna make it, we gone take out the struggle

All my niggas bout it, bout it, smokin' up when we roll through
When we roll through, smokin up what we roll through

Hit the mall, and spend it all

All my niggas with me, best believe me they all down to ride
And imma always be a silent nigga, long as I'm alive
