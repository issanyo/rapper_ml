[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Used to be a go-getter, now I'm riding solo
They be like Suzy, why your eyes so low?
Cause I'm blowing big kush, higher than the ozone
Got a bad bitch and she can't keep her clothes on
So I'm like bend over, touch your toes
Stop and strike that pose, and bring your friends over
And make them drop they clothes, as soon as they hit that door
I tell her go ahead and pose for the camera
Like I'm Tommy Lee and you Pamela
It's HBK we do our thing
If you wanna do me you gotta do our gang
Nigga we so paid and I can't complain
Choo-Choo this beat like a transit train
Young Su come through and command a show
I got that white girl no Amber Rose

[Hook: IamSu!]
We gone do it all night
We gone do it all night
We gone do it all night
Till the sun come up
Till the sun come up
Till the sun come up
They don't want it, I don't think so
I don't think so, I don't think so
They don't want it, I don't think so
I don't think so, I don't think so

[Verse 2: Show Banga]
Used to be a go-getter, now I'm riding solo
Trying to get my bread up, something like Togo's
Why you mad at Show though? Cuz Show snatch yo hoe
We always do it big do it big, Promo
We the best, niggas know doe
Every shirt I wear got that 100 rack logo
I bang that skull doe, everywhere I go though
Don't leave your girl around me, you already know doe
I love pussy, light L's solo, fly and flashy
She had to take a photo, the paper I chase
Get it on the go doe, for the quarterback in
Young Tony Romo (they know)
Beast in the game cousin you could believe that
And we can do it all night where the weed at
I am no vixen girl but that I need that
[?] for mayor now RT that
