Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
Look at the ice on my Cartiers
Counting that dough till my body hurts
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
All the girls [?] are partying
Tell the girl boot up on molly then
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier

[Verse 1]
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
Shawty she ask if it’s from Cartier
[?] racks and I’m sporting it
I know they hate, I ain’t worrying
Hardaway, Hardaway, Hardaway
I’m number one just like Hardaway
Bitch right here gone take the shot away
Knew that when I was a [?]
Split off in the whip so fast, she think I’m finna whip that ass
All she wanna do is pop Xan, all I wanna do is pop bands
And got to make that money, put the dick deep in her tummy
Broke ass niggas can’t call me, Cartier wrist, gold 40

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
Ball in the bay, I’m a warrior
NYC girls on my Cartier
Took me on flights of the [?]
Cartier, Cartier, Cartier
You won’t believe what just happened
Racks on my belt and I’m sagging
Touch down the pack, it just landed
My swag is way off the planet
I caught you haters red handed
Counting this dough, I got caliuses
I gotta call my accountant
