[Hook x2: Lex Aura]
Know I got xanax
Know I got reefer
I got the plug
Know I got xanax
Know I got reefer
I got the plug

[Verse 1: Lex Aura]
I got the xanax, girl, I got the reefer
I got the plug, I don't pay for sativa
I'm trying to fuck girl you already know
You got that body, you got me like woah
I'm switching lanes on my way to go see ya
Love when I touch on that skin and I tease ya
Move like a stripper [?]
Oh mama I'm so ready to go
I got the plug shawty, I got the plug
