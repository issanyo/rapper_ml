[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Top down in my city
Feeling just like the one
You better play with your PlayStation
Boy, you try play with us
I keep a big bank roll
And some drank in my cup
Runnin' shit, case closed
Coming through in the clutch
See me in NYC they choosed up Sour Diesel and Dutch
I had to smoke a couple times to make me cough too much
I'm independent, but eatin' like I'm platinum plus
You gotta get your money up to come and rap with us
Man, it's the same gang
I ain't even gotta tell you
It's a done deal
I don't even gotta sell you
I'm selling paraphernalia
I'm fly as planes and propellers
Been shining since Perry Ellis
You blinded like Helen Keller
I'm driving straight out the dealer
Do a donut out the lot
They loving me in the streets
But I'm really gon' pop
Cause I'mma run up 10 million
My girl look like a Brazilian
Young Suzy is in the building
I go 18 like a [?]

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Cause I'm a fly guy
I be fashionably late
Cause it's my time
I be busy cooking plays
When it's grind time
I be coming up with ways
When it's grind time
Cause it's grind time, yeah
I'm a fly guy
I be fashionably late
Cause it's my time
I be busy cooking plays
When it's grind time
I be coming up with ways
When it's grind time
When it's grind time, yeah

[Verse 2: Show Banga]
It's just grind time, trying to get it
We just jock em', we just live it
Got a mustache, gottem live it, how we g-g-g-get it
Really trill, this ain't no gimmick
Hang around us, that's a privilege
6 Speed to the cash
On the Glock that's in my vision
Pockets green, look like some lizards
Switching on 'em, like a wizard
John Wall, how we ball
I'mma finish, I'mma finish
I'm much nicer than them niggas
I be taking all their women
If Suzy hit me up
I know it's 'bout some business
Every day we making plays
Making Su be on that stage
We bring the city out
It's looking like a parade
Fly niggas with the wave
Don't let me around your bay
Full time on this grit
Got no time to play, uh

[Bridge: Show Banga]
I need Ben Franks
Lotta bitches, big bank
Broke bitches, no thanks
Grind harder, woah

[Chorus: IamSu!]
Cause I'm a fly guy
I be fashionably late
Cause it's my time
I be busy cooking plays
When it's grind time
I be coming up with ways
When it's grind time
Cause it's grind time, yeah
I'm a fly guy
I be fashionably late
Cause it's my time
I be busy cooking plays
When it's grind time
I be coming up with ways
When it's grind time
When it's grind time, yeah
