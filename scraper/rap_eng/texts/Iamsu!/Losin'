I am losin' myself to find you
I am losin' myself to find you
I am losin' myself to find you
Yeah I'm dying it's true
It's never been about anything more or anything less, it's all about you
Like I'm losing a war that I can't win
But I can't loose because I'll lose you

[Verse 1: CJ]
I'm realizing the definition of life and the line between truth and lies
So in the end I be lying where the truth lies
I'm a dog off the leash, they want me euthanized
Told me I'm not too far away, well I ain't too surprised
Looking down at the world like who the hell am I?
Chocolate thoughts while I'm wondering, vanilla skies
Waiting for my words to be heard, to be televised
It's the worst I'm impatient, I get the urge, go crazy and run the game just for exercise
Fuck the fame cause all the pain that I've gained on my way here is been left behind
So I'mma give you what I got not what I got to give
The worst part of being alive is only not to live

[Hook]
Losin' myself to find you
I am losin' myself to find you
I am losin' myself to find you
Yeah I'm dying it's true

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
It goes, breaking down the weed, heading to the money
Got an outta pocket speed, yeah it's true indeed
In the newest sneaks, doing interviews bout how I moved about the streets and how I started make beats
I mean great stone, Jordan shorts on, sipping Crystal
Man that shit's wild
Telling P-lo we gon' be good tell CJ the same thang
However you wanna put it, I put on the whole gang
I put HBK every song, they ain't take it serious
Fresh pyramids on Mars I think it's really glirious, perilous
They say here we go, on your stereo
World spinning, it go round and round, like a merry go
Barely know, but I swear to god I'mma deal em hot as hell
I'm a criminal stacking money to the ceiling but
Feelings niggas fake, I'm past good, feeling like I'm great
Bitch I need millions on my plate like

[Hook]
