[Intro]
Walk inside the bank, counting Benjamin Franklin
Every single morning, take a knee and then thank him
Cover up my nose 'cause the weed's smoke stanky
Guarantee she know every song that I'm

[Bridge]
Yeah baby, I see you over there, sundress
I don't know who fine, you or your mama though
But ay, I could fuck with either one of y'all

[Hook]
Walk inside the bank, counting Benjamin Franklin
Every single morning, take a knee and then thank him
Cover up my nose 'cause the weed's smoke stanky
Guarantee she know every song that I'm singing
Getting on my nerves, telling me that I'm changing
Foreign car swerve, 580, lane changing
On my own wave, I don't owe no explaination
Never tell a soul all my private inform

[Verse 1]
Plotting all my moves 'cause this shit be getting dangerous
Marble on the floors, and the fixtures all stainless
Lamborghini doors, I'mma pull up in a spaceship
I will never understand why people always hating
Posted in the class, told Derek I'mma make it
I just want the money, give a fuck about famous
Play this in the club, all the pretty girls shake it
Chrome hard car, you can't do to your framing

[Pre-Hook]
I've arrived
Now she want to visit my side
Hit the boulevard, with my guys
She's movie star, in my eyes

[Hook]
Walk inside the bank, counting Benjamin Franklin
Every single morning, take a knee and then thank him
Cover up my nose 'cause the weed's smoke stanky
Guarantee she know every song that I'm singing
Getting on my nerves, telling me that I'm changing
Foreign car swerve, 580, lane changing
On my own wave, I don't owe no explaination
Never tell a soul all my private information

[Outro]
I know you know
I know you know you know
I know you know
I know you know
