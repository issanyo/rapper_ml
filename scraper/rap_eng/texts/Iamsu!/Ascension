[Verse]
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
Said fuck following whoever decided to leave
God’s speed, Rocky at the top of the steps
Give everything I have in me, 'till it’s nothing left
A man’s defined by his words, quiet as its kept
Keep your third eye open, no paying intercept
Son, what’s the meaning of life?
Trying to stick to the code, I’m not reading it right
Uh, so one can be a sign
Feels like everybody around me is living a lie
Enough water that I could drown all the tears of my eyes
Wanna make the world a little better, before my demise
Feel like the gap is getting longer, the higher I climb
Having to put myself right again time after time
Line after line I’m elevating the collective conscious
Skipped over college, took my tuition, I made a direct deposit
Into the school of hard knocks, I'm majoring in my dreams
And now my wallet is so big that it can't fit in my jeans
God, family and music, won’t let the shit intervene
I had a dream when I was younger, I was winning that ring
I had to switch up my roster, switch up my mantra
Hard to stay humble when they’re praising you at concerts
Stupid, occupied so I divide up my attention
Thought she wanted me to blow, how you can’t do with my ascension

[Hook]
I thought you loved me
(I do love you!)
I thought... I thought you were the one for me
(Baby, I’m the one for you I know it!)
Like, forever?
(I want this shit forever)
What happened?
(I don’t know, I was tripping)
(I was on the, I was on the bullshit like)
(The insecurities in my mind just kept working in)
(It’s was just the bitches and the I don’t even know)
(I was tripping please)
(It doesn’t even matter like)
You’re all I want, I’m sorry no
(Wait no, come back)
(Don’t, don’t walk away from me)
(Cause I need you, I love you)
(I'm sorry, please, I'm not good without you)
(Don't leave me)

[Chorus]
I thought you loved me
I thought you love me
You said
I thought you loved me
I thought you loved me
No, no, no, it’s not love, no
