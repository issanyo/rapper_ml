[Intro]
Yeah, talk your shit

[Hook]
I know counting money feel better than an orgasm
Latest technology, that OLED plasma
I got one policy, just never kill a nigga vibe
New foreign outside
Hate on me and you get maxed out, maxed out
Bitch I'm balling, Jerry Stackhouse
Shmop house, Shmop house
Pop out, pop out

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Left wrist Rolex, my Moncler coat check
Young Su fell off
Bounce back, no sweat
All these niggas ball, is where the fuck the coach at
Authentic flavor, no they can't coach that
Flying cross country and I got that pack on me
He say he my brother, but he turn his back on me
In the studio with more than 50 racks on me
I keep 5 chains on me 'cause my neck was gettin' lonely
Hit the stage it's pandemonium, the fans scream for me
I'mma jump inside the audience, every song a body
They ain't know the life we living, taking hundreds from my [?]
Hop inside that wraith and get the fuck about my feelings
Willy nilly, independent, press a button lose the ceiling
I know niggas ain't enough for me and in time it will reveal it

[Pre-Hook]
But it's left wrist Rolex, my Moncler coat check
Hop out, so fresh
I feel so blessed

[Hook]
I know counting money feel better than an orgasm
Latest technology, that OLED plasma
I got one policy, just never kill a nigga vibe
New foreign outside
Play with me and you get maxed out, maxed out
Bitch I'm balling, Jerry Stackhouse
Shmop house, Shmop house
Pop out, pop out
