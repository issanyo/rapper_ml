[Hook: Iamsu]
Out on my own, I don't have to be cool
You won't believe all the things people do
I had a dream and I made it come true
I had a dream and I made it come true
My haters can't stand it
At the top, and I'm stranded
No, no, they can't stop it
I got this shit popping

[Verse 1: Iamsu]
Gang, got them skittles in my chain
Engine in the trunk, Cartier frame
You ain't talking cash, nigga I don't entertain
Out the bottle when I drank, Colorado smoking strains
Strange, what these people do for some change
I never switch up, on my niggas, that's lame
What they got against us, going dumb on Insta
Hit the mall, buy it all, then I take a pitcha
Ooh, I mean a picture, I'm a fucking fixture
Straight tequila to the neck, I don't want a mixer
I ain't fucking with you niggas, no money, no sir
500 for a shirt, DriveKore with the work
I was thinking about retirement, but fuck it rap need me
With the gas, like a bum with a squeegee
Stack that money from the floor 'till it's knee deep
I played your tape one time, then hit delete, yeah

[Hook: Iamsu]
Out on my own, I don't have to be cool
You won't believe all the things people do
I had a dream and I made it come true
I had a dream and I made it come true
My haters can't stand it
At the top, and I'm stranded
No, no, they can't stop it
I got this shit popping

[Verse 2: Goldie]
Ay, go getter, Rich city for reala
Dope nigga, from the deal' like four wheela, ay
If you pocket watching, you's a hoe nigga
My area full of apes and they stay gorilla, ay
Lips on the coupe look like Kylie Jenner
Got a bitch on the side, and she prolly dealing, ay
These niggas can't stand it, ay
But they scheming and planning
You know and shit, all my niggas rolling, ay
Dolce pouring, ay
Out there outscoring, ay
Tryna ball, acting like you knowing shit
Nah, we ain't got the same mother, but we brothers like an orphanage, huh
[?] with me, [?] with me, Yeezy Boost 350, gold piece seem prissy, ay
Too smooth with me, now the scene seem dizzy
Got these hoes and they feelings, no this shit seem Drizzy
Sheesh

[Hook: Iamsu]
Out on my own, I don't have to be cool
You won't believe all the things people do
I had a dream and I made it come true
I had a dream and I made it come true
My haters can't stand it
At the top, and I'm stranded
No, no, they can't stop it
I got this shit popping
