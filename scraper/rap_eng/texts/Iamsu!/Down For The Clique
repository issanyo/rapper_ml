[Chorus]
Gotta be down for the click, alright
Gotta be down for the click, alright
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh

[Verse 1: Mike Dash-E]
She shaking insane
I swear she making a name
Fuck with a popular brain
Ho, HBK be the gang
I'm never breaking the lanes
But, I be breaking this mane
I never talk to a bitch, unless she making some change
Down for the click, 'cause we came up
Fucked around, got the whole bay changed up
Put my city on the map, you can blame us
And now I turn a tour bus to a bang bus

[Verse 2: ]
I think you gotta be down what I'm down for
I can leave you singing like an alto
I could do ya better than them others do ya
Put it on the team 'cause we making movies
So tell me if you down, 'cause I'm down too
We ain't like nothing like them niggas that you used to
It's the Heart Break Gang when we come through
If you ready for whatever baby fall through

[Chorus]
Gotta be down for the click, alright
Gotta be down for the click, alright
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh

[Verse 3: Iamsu]
'Cause she wanna break it down for the gang
Tell her partners hang with us
Drank with us, smoke with us
'Cause we ain't no broke niggas
Getting money like the white kid in Blankcheck
Fuck off some racks, 'cause we make it back
Because some of them try to ball, but they can't ball like this
Everything I spit is Cochem, get an eight ball of this
Rolex all on wrist, I be shinin'
And it's Heart Break the click, ho, we be grindin'

[Verse 4: Sage the Gemini]
If you bring your girlfriend, then you messed up
She deliver that good dome, Fedexed up
No handcuffs, step off, who next up
Got your girlfriend in the game with both her legs up
And I be in your girl like mixed emotions
In it, posin', swerving it, ghostin'
She lovin' the money, but do not get the holdin'
I pull it out and just let her hold it
What's up?

[Chorus]
Gotta be down for the click, alright
Gotta be down for the click, alright
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh

[Verse 5: Dave Steezy]
I need a girl down with the click
Sippin' hella Jammie, pourin' rounds and we sip
Profound, hella thick, with a grip that will benefit
If you ain't talking money, you irrelevant
I'm hella been, with the HBK Gang
If you ain't fucking then bitch you can't hang
Three's up high and we banging the same
Ain't nothing changed
But the numbers by the name
I hope we change it for the fame

[Verse 6: ]
Tell her bring some weed cause that shit is essential
And if she don't smoke then she don't meet my credentials
I'm just gettin' money, dressed in that ill shit
And I tend to kill shit, school them as a field trip
Coolin' with my niggas and I'm getting high
And you lame niggas barely even gettin' by
And if she wanna be down then let her live her life
We just tryna get it my nigga
So let get it right

[Chorus]
Gotta be down for the click, alright
Gotta be down for the click, alright
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be down for the click
Gotta be
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
Woooaahh, ohhhhhh
