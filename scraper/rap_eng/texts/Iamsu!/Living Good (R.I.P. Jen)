[Chorus: Problem]
I'm living good, why you wanna see me doing bad nigga?
Your bitch just left, say its the best night she done ever had, nigga
Hoe stop lying, real bitches holla out
Nigga stop lying, real niggas holla out

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle & Problem]
I came back with some better rhymes
Bigger name, bigger chain and better rock
As I operate the enterprise
Real nigga, first mil, you re-energize
Fake gone, real finna rise
Niggas wouldn't believe all the bad bitches I done been inside
Beating the odds, ain't a bigger prize
Kill me off 'fore I live a lie

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm living good, why you wanna see me doing bad nigga?
Your bitch just left, say its the best night she done ever had, nigga
Hoe stop lying, real bitches holla out
Nigga stop lying, real niggas holla out

[Verse 2: IamSu! & Problem]
My phone won't stop ringing, Fat T keep on hitting me
The homie just got his head knocked off on Century (fuck)
To us that's fucked up, to the opps that's a victory
15 years later still fuck with me, mentally
Won't let it get to me (roll up), the weed it be fixing me
Off of 6 O's like wit Biggie and where Nipsey be
What?!
Let me break it up, life like dice, time to shake it up
What?!
(Diamond) I'm living life, boy
And she bust it open for the right boy
The devil think we got a price, boy
It's on you if you gonna prove them right, boy
Diamond light, Mr light nigga
Chained up, turning up like them white niggas
I'm doing me, why you mad? What's the gripe nigga?
I hit the weed then I run the light nigga
Shots

[Chorus: Problem]
I'm living good why you wanna see me doing bad nigga?
Your bitch just left, say its the best night she done ever had nigga
Hoe stop lying, real bitches holla out
Nigga stop lying, real niggas holla out

[Bridge: Problem & Nipsey Hussle]
Light the weed, then I levitate
We in this here to innovate
We'll let all you other niggas emulate
Survival in this shit, that'll make 'em whine

[Interlude]
Wait a minute, what the fuck is your problem?
You got a fucking problem?
I know what your problem is
You got nothing better to do with your life
But I'll give you a fucking real problem
Chachi, talk to these motherfuckers

[Verse 3: Problem]
Let me, let me loose, let me, let me loose
Throwing fingers out the roof, motherfuck a truce
HBK, Diamond Lane, we hit our squad goals
Don't need you niggas for nothing as far as our squad goes
In that pussy, diving deep, no goggles
Chachi, Paparazzi, count a million with his eyes closed
Bad Lucc, Kool John, P-Lo, Sage the Gemini
Cali outcast, so lets drop a fucking 'Quemini
Never put a bitch over the business 'cause these women lie
Why? 'Cause these women lie, 'cause these 'cause these women lie
Drop this shit and kill these niggas like it's genocide
Never ill-advised, please respect my business mind
'Cause all this shit pimping to me
This rap game, only thing I see different is me
And I don't talk about it, I just go Nike on a nigga
Ask Su, he done see me go hyphy on a nigga, it's the crew
Never catch us with our hands out, only bands out
See us coming, pull 'em cams out, ch-ch-cheese
White bitches, on they knees, Thelma and Louise
Yell it out on three, "Fuck my enemies"

Yell it out on three, "Fuck my enemies"
