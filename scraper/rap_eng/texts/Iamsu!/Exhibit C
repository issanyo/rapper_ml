[Intro]
Uh, Su!
3, 2, 1
Y'all can't fuck with it
Uh, Exhibit Su!

[Verse 1]
I don't chase women cause money bring 'em to me
But fuck these hoes, I'm too high, someone where the roof be
Made my own way, pardon me, excuse me
Every kid without a voice, yeah they speaking for me
Street disciple, higher than the Eiffel
Haters are encouragement, I need a nigga [?]
Spit that grand [?]
