Always on me, telling about I'm cheating
Going through phone every time a Nigga sleeping

Somebody say it's wrong but it feels so right
Yeah, So right, feeling so right, called on my ex she ain't putting no fight
A Nigga... low, she's been texting all night said her man's out of town like a sexy dawn night
