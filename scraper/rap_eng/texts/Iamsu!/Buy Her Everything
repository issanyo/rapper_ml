[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
You made a career off of my old flow
Teaming up against me, that won't help though
Pray she never login to my iCloud
Cause it's over if she ever see my cellphone
Enemies they tryna beat my boys now
I will not forgive if I don't have to
I will never go back to the old Su
Got some morals in my life I gotta hold to
Wait, I took your advance and went and bought me an estate
She used to eatin' fast food, with me she eatin' steak
They have their opinions but won't say it to my face
I'm not an assistant, I never will relate
I got a bigger influence
Like a pair of new Timberlands, your boy is rebooted
Speakin' lies on me, I'll never have to refute it
Cause the people know what's goin' on
We don't have to make a song, it's life

[Hook: Iamsu!]
Yeah I know that life can be a bitch, but I'mma buy her everything and rub her feet, woah, woah, woah
I hear all the comments that you make about me, but I will never lose sleep, no, no, no
Wake up in the morning grab my phone and make a play before I even brush my teeth, woah, woah, woah
It was never easy and it was never sweet, got a practice what I preach, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Iamsu!]
I can never stop, the game need me
I don't got no time to watch the TV
Every time I drop, I be on repeat
Whole body dripping gold like CP
Three-O, Steph Curry beast mode
Just like him, I'm goin' crazy at the Oracle
Just like him, I'm never goin' have to make a pay cut
Just like him, I need a check before I lace up
Stop, hold up, let me go and get my head right
Drop, fuck around go platinum with the sound like
Roll, dice, if I buy that girl a round of flights
Sike, only in your dreams, baby but it sound nice
I've been eating better, grilled chicken with the brown rice
Young Bari with me, even though I'm on my own hype
Need an elevator in my crib, I got to many flights
Frequent flyer mileage like a bitch, I took too many flights

[Hook: Iamsu!]
Yeah I know that life can be a bitch, but I'mma buy her everything and rub her feet, woah, woah, woah
I hear all the comments that you make about me, but I will never lose sleep, no, no, no
Wake up in the morning grab my phone and make a play before I even brush my teeth, woah, woah, woah
It was never easy and it was never sweet, got a practice what I preach, woah, woah

[Verse 3: Skipper]
Hearing what they say about a nigga, I'm just tryna get these figures bigger picture, woah, woah, woah
Hopping off the plane, ain't nobody in my lane, real niggas never change, no, no, no
Niggas wanna talk, but never say shit
She just want my time, she on the wait list
Got it on my own, I had to make shit
Now I'm plotting on the Rollie with the face lift
Been getting bitches since side kicks and tmails
Gas is similar to a V12
Let her have a sip, she coming back for the refill
Yeah it's rare to come across a nigga with these skills
I just kill
Presidential nigga at your neck just like a bow tie
Sudy hit a triple, I'mma clean it up in no time
Praying to the Lord that he protect me from these low lifes
I can fuck with them because they switching, playing both sides, damn

[Hook: Iamsu!]
