[Verse 1: Iamsu!]
Whole lot of rich nigga shit
Whole lot of bad hoes on my dick
I run it up just to get a check
I run it up just to get respect
I'm drippin', I'm drippin'
My hunnids, they crippin'
I play, my position
My new bitch, dirty thing call her Pippen
Young, rich, and intelligent
Gotta memory like an elephant
Everybody tell me money talks
You got a speech impediment
Got so much gas that we billing it
She hit the crib and inhale the dick
I'm on the wave, yeah I'm sailing it
Zip like the pack, and they mailing it
Ah, ooh, yeah, diamonds they all in my chain
Ooh, that is irrelevant
Ah, ooh, diamonds they spell out my name
Ooh, girl can you spell this shit
Off white on my waist
I'm banking Wells Fargo, not Chase
I'm out in Ventura like Ace
I need them blue hunnids in my face, yeah
