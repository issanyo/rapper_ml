[Verse 1]
Woah, yup
Hating ass niggas got plenty
I'm the shit, first name ain't Winnie, yup
Big ass niggas from The City
Trying to say it with your chest but bitch you got titties
Got your girlfriend face down, ass up
See the diamonds, it's a problem, got bad luck
Call a nigga late night saying bad stuff
I hit it from the back bruh, tell her back it up
I get money and bitches, shout out to Fat Veezy
Broke bitches act up, I turn Chris Breezy
It's like yee-ho swerve, you do not please me
You niggas hella weak, yeah I know you see me, yup

[Chorus]
All up in my face ho
A young nigga 'bout to go catch a case ho
I'm the man where I'm from, thought you heard
Yeah the bird is the word, he's a nerd
I don't care, say swerve
My name they speak on (say swerve)
They mad 'cause we on (say swerve)
My name they speak on (say swerve)
They mad 'cause we on (say swerve)

[Verse 2]
You can't even have a girl ho starting rumors
(But it ain't nothing to a star, bitch I'm Carl's Jr)
Light a L I ain't talking loser
I be balling swiss cheese, yeah Carlos Boozer
I be gassing, huh, that's what your mama said
Great minds think alike I love your mama head
Red bone in the bed, bob sled down the bombaclot
The neighbors hate the head board 'cause it bump a lot
You a hating ass nigga you sit at home a lot
Trying to watch a nigga twitter see what I'm all about, eww
I just love money and booty your girlfriend giving it to me

[Chorus]
All up in my face ho
A young nigga 'bout to go catch a case ho
I'm the man where I'm from, thought you heard
Yeah the bird is the word, he's a nerd
I don't care, say swerve
My name they speak on (say swerve)
They mad 'cause we on (say swerve)
My name they speak on (say swerve)
They mad 'cause we on (say swerve)

[Chorus]
All up in my face ho
A young nigga 'bout to go catch a case ho
I'm the man where I'm from, thought you heard
Yeah the bird is the word, he's a nerd
I don't care, say swerve
My name they speak on (say swerve)
They mad 'cause we on (say swerve)
My name they speak on (say swerve)
They mad 'cause we on (say swerve)
