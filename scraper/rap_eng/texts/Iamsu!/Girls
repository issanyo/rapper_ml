Yeah, yeah
I just wanna chill, I just wanna smoke
Slide through the city, go see my folks
And I like girls that like that shit!
And I like girls that like that shit!
Say, I just wanna chill, I just wanna smoke
Slide through the city, go see my folks
And I like girls that like that shit!
And I like girls that like that shit!

[Verse 1: IamSu!]
I met a girl, her name was Ashley
Met her at the flea market, by Ashby
She was taking pics on the disposable
I was trying my hardest to get close to you
She do yoga on the weekends
She a model on the side
Post her pictures on the Instagram (Instagram)
Like to keep her body tight!
And she got a 9 to 5, left the club at 1:15
All she hear is bullshit in both ears
But I’m trying to get in between

[Hook: IamSu!]
I just wanna chill, I just wanna smoke
Slide through the city, go see my folks
And I like girls that like that shit!
And I like girls that like that shit!
Say, I just wanna chill, I just wanna smoke
Slide through the city, go see my folks
And I like girls that like that shit!
And I like girls that like that shit!

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I think I got a thang for her
She’s run my mind all the time
I let her call my cell phone
She got my direct line
Late nights I would smoke with her
Tell about a nigga dreams
She has aspirations of her own
I told her, I know what you mean!
I know what you mean, at least I think I do
I just want that love but lord, you know that pink and blue
Twenty questions, go ahead and interview I'm
Really into you, and be with me is what you meant to do

[Hook: IamSu!]
I just wanna chill, I just wanna smoke
Slide through the city, go see my folks
And I like girls that like that shit!
And I like girls that like that shit!
Say, I just wanna chill, I just wanna smoke
Slide through the city, go see my folks
And I like girls that like that shit!
And I like girls that like that shit!

I just wanna chill, I just wanna smoke
I said, I just wanna chill, I just wanna smoke
Slide through the city, go see my folks
And I like girls that like that shit!
And I like girls that like that shit!
