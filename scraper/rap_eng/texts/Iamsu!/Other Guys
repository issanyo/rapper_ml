[Verse 1]
My name is Su, I'm here for your enjoyment
I go to work, no I am never looking for employment
Stay fresh to death like I don't ever understand the thought of spoiling
Don't make no sense, she want some shit I'm on a different toilet
So get it straight, my gang getting cake
HBK, let it bang in ya face
Haters talk, but I don't pay attention to them
Cause we doing it, they just sitting in they living room
You ain’t never met nobody like us
And since you only live once, you better live this life fucked up
Uh, so everyday I stunt
Woke up in the morn’ like it’s the first of the month
Getting paid, you know my money straight
Can’t see you lil' homies, the money in the way
Young Suzy, I am nothing that you used to
Heart Breakers, we the leaders of the new school

[Hook]
I know you, heard it all before
But I'm nothing like them other guys, like them other guys
The things we do, let you know for sure
That I'm nothing like them other guys, like them other guys

[Verse 2]
Nothing like you used to
Rapping, I produce too
Heartbreak gang, yeah we got the juice too
She said she used to all these rappers being assholes
Told her those be them rappers that ain't got no cash flow
Always improving, spitting sicker than my last flow
She said she sorry that she couldn’t make my last show
Cause it was crackin’ like an old head back bone
I was gone for a minute, now I'm back on
Uh, Young Suzy coming out of Richmond
But I am nothing like them others, I am something different
These rappers talk but best believe none of that shit they living
Cause they wouldn't be in the studios, they'd be in prisons (locked up)
But I'm just chilling, focused on a million
You rapping bout killing, I'm tryna find the women
So we can kick it like taekwondo
Streets love me, there ain't anywhere that I can't go
Suzie!

[Hook]
I know you, heard it all before
But I'm nothing like them other guys, like them other guys
The things we do, let you know for sure
That I'm nothing like them other guys, like them other guys
