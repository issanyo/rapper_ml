[Verse 1]
I walk with a dip up in my swagger
Can't fuck with you rappers
All you rapper's actors
I'm the total package
I'm a cold assassin
Smoke a bowl of grass until the end I'm grasping
I just took a shot I think I went too far
I just popped a bottle I'm still at the bar
I don't pop no molly, left that in '13
Fucking up with checks over kick and  jeans
I can't trust these bitches
I can't trust these hoes
Focused on my digits, gotta get my dough
I can't sign that contract
I can't sell my soul
I've been on that road ten thousand dollar shows
They say we wouldn't pop up, I'm dipped up in that new shit
Black bandana like 2Pac don't ask me where the juices
OGs in my city, I respect the movement
All these rappers they ain't near me, imitating Suzy

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask her if she want to turn up with young Suzy, she say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask 'em can I bring my whole team in the building, they say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every time I hit the stage I make a movie, they say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We all black, we don't play, and they say

[Verse 2]
Work stay on my guestlist thereâ€™s no unemployment
All these hoes for free, they here for your enjoyment
I do this full time now there ain't no need for practice
Once upon a time had hunnids in my mattress
All I do is turn up, turn up on my haters
Can't do shit for free, I do not fuck with favors
You ain't help us eat, you can't sit at the table
They say that I'm crazy, they say that I'm unstable
Got to this position, it all came from grinding
Cuban bracelet, cuban linx, change them for diamonds
All this damn finessin' just to get this paper
Focused on progression, tryna switch my neighbors

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask her if she want to turn up with young Suzy, she say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask 'em can I bring my whole team in the building, they say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every time I hit the stage I make a movie, they say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We all black, we don't play, and they say
