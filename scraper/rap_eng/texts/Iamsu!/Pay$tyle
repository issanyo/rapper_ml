[IamSu!]
In-In-In the club twisting up fingers
All I fuck with is models and singers
I be with that nigga Problem
He tell me Diamond what the Lane is
Hea-Heart Break what the gang is
Real niggas who I hang with
I-I-I get love from the drug dealers
I get love from the skaters
You know how we go, Versace shades on no Migos
Cheifo, eyes on P-Lo
New Bay MJ, Ya'll lames Tido
I'm in H-Town gettin love like Zero
Deebo, that's what I do to these niggas
Been getting money it ain't new to me nigga
Rich city nigga move straight to the burbs
Popping Ace of Spades bottles, never sipping on syrup
Nigga wear sets and it's straight to you
Young nigga that's right like a straight ruler
Gold chains on like I'm Rick Rubin
Give them 99 problems like Rick Ruban
Stuff raw paper until it's thick cuban
Go M.I.A fuck with a thick cuban
[?] throw a stack at it
While she work and I told her look back at it
Look back at it, look back at it
She got Heart Break Gang on her back tatted
Top floor sweet at the Sofitel
I got the power Felli Fel
Shout out to my homies cause they know me well
Gin got me jumping over bitches no miguel
Right now we in the club with the homies
And I got like ten hotties on me
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
