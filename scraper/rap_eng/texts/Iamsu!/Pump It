[Hook: Dj E]
Pump it pump it, back it up and dump it
On the dance floor lil mama don't cuff it

Oow ahh oow ahh, girl lemme touch it

Got knowledge from your girl, she gimme brain
Got a beast in my jeans that i can't tame

Bounce that ass on my lap, but lemme see you
And I promise I won't tell what we do

[Verse 2: DC]
Shake, shake, shake that ass lil mama gone twerk it

[Verse 4: Snackz]
You know I gotta lotta hoes all across the nation
But you don't really give a shit, like constipation
You say you play hard to get, but I don't got the patients
We needa make like Drake and have a celebration
So gimme gimme gimme gimme that bitch

You know that I'm great, I can beat it up quick
She like it automatic, but she love to drive stick (ehh)

[Verse 5: Ace-B]
Hop off the pogo, say it like a loco
Tatted like a cholo, get ass, no homo
She road me like a volvo, I'm froze like a photo
Yo girl on my dick and she say she movin solo
Snapback peasent, I'm fresh like a present
Your girl on my dick and she said it was plesant
Boy keep it lit, yo girl is my slave
I make her get low, just like a fuckin grave

[Ending Hook: Dj E]
Pump it pump it, back it up and dump it
On the dance floor lil mama don't cuff it
Like oow ahh oow ahh, girl lemme touch it
Oow ahh oow ahh, girl lemme touch it
