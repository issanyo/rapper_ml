Verse 1

Gouda chippas cheddar cheese spinach lettuce

If it ain't money callin you can leave a message

Really all about my stackin doooooog

Ima act a fucken fool all at the malllll

Damn straight got the Famm with me

We all out wit no hands empty

Hot boy no need to temp me

Ima keep collectin till the safe is empty

Got long as list and I gotta own all that shit

Pull up to the crib in a benz

Got chrome on all that shit I been wildin out!



Chorus



When I get them bands tell em Ima blow it

When I get them bands tell em Ima blow it

Watch Ima show out

20's 50's 100's tell um Ima blow it

20's 50's 100's tell um Ima blow it

Watch Ima show out

Watch Ima show out
