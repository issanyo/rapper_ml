[Intro]
Nah for real (x3)

[Hook]
You know I got them racks, nah for real
Whole city on my back, nah for real
Laughing at them when they try to offer deals
Whole team getting money, nah for real
Nah for real, nah for real, nah for real, nah for real
You know I got them racks, nah for real
Whole city on my back, nah for real

[Verse 1]
Pull up in the toy, nah for real
Billionaire boy, but I'm not for real
I don't trust these niggas 'cause they prolly tell
Put a million dollars up, they out there floppin still
Nah for real, nah for real
Every day I'm shining, got a diamond grill
Ice could change the climate, nah for real
Every day I'm out here grinding, nah for real
Hot like I came straight out the dryer
That vodka and that Red Bull got me wired
I see what I want, then I go buy it
Tell lil' baby do her thing just how I like it

[Hook]
You know I got them racks, nah for real
Whole city on my back, nah for real
Laughing at them when they try to offer deals
Whole team getting money, nah for real
Nah for real, nah for real, nah for real, nah for real
You know I got them racks, nah for real
Whole city on my back, nah for real

[Verse 2]
When I hit the city, it be too popping
Big Suzy man want the Bugatti
I'm the boss man, get the most profit
You a fake fan, your favorite rapper's garbage
Cameras in the air, this shit don't happen often
I want the top spot, make these niggas come up off it
Out of town, let's hit the city, please proceed with caution
See me out here, dipping, dabbing in some new Pink Dolphin
I've been killing everything, so hot I fuck around and melt it
Drop me in that water, bet I bubble like some Alka-Seltzer
I need all the love they got to give me 'cause I'm feeling selfish
Make a lil' cake and they jealous, jumpman rockin' margielas

[Outro]
You know I got them racks, nah for real
Whole city on my back, nah for real
Laughing at them when they try to offer deals
Whole team getting money, nah for real
Nah for real, nah for real, nah for real, nah for real
You know I got them racks, nah for real
Whole city on my back, nah for real
