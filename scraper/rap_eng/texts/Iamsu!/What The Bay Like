[Chorus: IamSu!]
All it really takes is one time
I'm hustling I can't waste no time
I hit it from the back like a brake light
She just wanna see what the bay like
All it really takes is one time
I'm hustling I can't waste no time
I hit it from the back like a brake light
She just wanna see what the bay like yeahhh
She just wanna see what the bay like yeahhh
She just wanna see what the bay like

[Verse 1: AKAFrank]
All it really takes is one time
Girl I been thrown out my mind
These hoes on me wait in line
Feeling like the best in my prime
Take you to my city got my niggas with me
Move like a unit I ain't talking fifty
Text niggas like the tours when we cross them
Gotta win for all my niggas that lost some
She riding with a star I'm ringo
She like put me on game whats the lingo
Five plays in a row, bingo
It's a movie when we always on the scene ho
These niggas so mad got no shine
Make love to the money on my grind
AKA I can show you what a day like
She hooked on this weed and the bay life

[Chorus: IamSu!]

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Aye, all it really take is one time
Take a trip to the bank that's a fun time
You a fake, you a joke, you a punchline
I'ma drink, I'ma smoke, have a fun time
Aye, made money but I need more
On the route to the cake you a detour
If she down for the play I'ma speak to her
But if she fuck up on my order make her redo it
These niggas ain't real we can see through it
I just speak on how I feel put a beat to it
These niggas amateur can't do this shit how we do it
I wanna SC400 or a Buick
Real stupid, hyphy even
Tell her by the end of the night we leaving
We do what we wanna book a flight we leaving
Twenty thousand dollars for a show this evening

[Chorus: IamSu!]
