[Intro]
Hot damn, hoe, here we go again
Top 5, top 5, all we do is win
The starting line up sucks, coach put me in
Do a major, although Eyes on Me the label independ...
(sirens)
IamSu!

[Verse 1]
I had, to jump some hurdles on my road to riches
I mean, when I say hurdles I say weirdos and fake bitches
Back against the wall, they wanna see me fall, huh
Just like CJ, I will fall up
No trust, so what, I give no fucks
Long list of MC's that I Shaq post up
Still hit G&L, cop me a Pro Club
Boycott Subway, cause I don't like subs

[Verse 2]
I got ice in my veins, I won't lose my cool, no
And I never let her play me for a fool, no
I pity the fool
Read the menu, hated the food
Made a solid 5k before I made it to school
A lot of people violated, I just played that shit cool
I know they was raised different, I just play by the rules
I'm the center of they energy
Don't got time to understand why they envy me
And I took a step back from doing interviews
Cause I was giving up the style that these niggas use
So I gotta pick and choose
Let's get it

[Hook]
And this is only track one
All my niggas 'bout that action
So I put 'em in position
I'm just sticking to the mission
They can't stop my shine, no, no, they can't stop my shine
They can't stop my shine, no, no, they can't stop my shine

[Verse 3]
Hot damn, hoe, here we go again
Top 5, top 5, all we do is win
The starting line up sucks, coach put me in
Do a major, although Eyes on Me the label independ
Took a shit, I recorded in Depends
Paint me picture, got my eyes on every quarter when it spin
I'm a boss, it's gon' work out in the end
Duel exhaust when I pull off in the Benz
Lately I've been in my bag like a pack lunch
Everything is understood, I don't ask much
Racks up, racks up, we gon' act up
Four seats, six girls, so they lapped up
Downtown Westville, pop a tag on 'em
Whip that new shit off the lot, cop a Jag on 'em
And my family really proud, they gon' brag on me
G-Star sag on
I can't go out sad, homie

[Hook]
And this is only track one (yeah, yeah)
All my niggas 'bout that action (all my niggas 'bout that action)
So I put 'em in position
I'm just sticking to the mission (get that bag, get that bag, get that bag)
They can't stop my shine, no, no, they can't stop my shine (my shine)
They can't stop my shine, no, no, they can't stop my shine (my shine)

[Outro]
So I put 'em in position
I'm just sticking to the mission
Get that bag, get that bag, get that bag
They can't stop my shine, no, no, they can't stop my shine (my shine)
They can't stop my shine, no, no, they can't stop my shine (my)
