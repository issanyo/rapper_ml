[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ay

[Hook]
Man this shit be too deep, I be counting blue cheese
When I get that top, that shit keep me going
I be having groupies, tryna bang young Suzy
You can't be my wife, 'cause I know you hoeing
Got a billion on my head, watch me get that shit
I be going crazy when I spit that shit
Young, black, and rich, young young, black, and rich
Young, black, and rich, young young, black, and rich

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna bubble
I need million in my safe, crib with a gate
So my family is straight
I was down bad, when nobody held me up
I was on my ass, ain't nobody give a fuck
Now I'm living fast, Mercedes Benz with the paper tag
I had to stop telling my business because these bitches blab
Really fake, 'cause it ain't no in between though
Is it money or the fame, what you here for
I can look you in your eyes and see that shit ain't right
Nightmares about betrayal when I sleep at night
So its 24/7 on the case, I am
Karma good because I'm everything I say I am

[Hook]
Man this shit be too deep, I be counting blue cheese
When I get that top, that shit keep me going
I be having groupies, tryna bang young Suzy
You can't be my wife, 'cause I know you hoeing
Got a billion on my head, watch me get that shit
I be going crazy when I spit that shit
Young, black, and rich, young young, black, and rich
Young, black, and rich, young young, black, and rich
