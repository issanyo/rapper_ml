[Hook]
I be, I be
The man 'round here
The mayor can't do it like me, like me
My diamonds are clear
'Bout to put this shit in gear, ooh
Now we just getting started
Big racks on me
I buy it if i want it, for real
Now we just getting started
Big racks on me
I buy it if i want it

[Verse 1]
Black benz with the black seats
I can't hit the mall no more 'cause they harass me
They like "Su how you get it?" that's what she ask me
All cash, Uncle Sam never touch me

[Verse 2]
I call her, Milk Marie, she spoiled
Ice on me, I'm froze
Best believe she chose
Yet, still I need my dope
I'm on 10, eyes glazed like a donut
Imma walk inside the club but I won't throw nothin'
I'm a pea, I'mma crack her like a cold one
Got utensils and the green, baby roll up

[Hook x3]
I be, I be
The man 'round here
The mayor can't do it like me, like me
My diamonds are clear
'Bout to put this shit in gear, ooh
Now we just getting started
Big racks on me
I buy it if i want it, for real
Now we just getting started
Big racks on me
I buy it if i want it, for real
