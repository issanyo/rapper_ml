[Intro]
Yeah
Okay

[Chorus]
Ridin' 'round in the Bay (In the Bay)
New Su goin' crazy (Su goin' crazy)
And I ain't worried 'bout shit unless it's 'bout gettin' rich (Uh huh)
It's eyes on me baby
Ridin' 'round in the Bay (In the Bay)
New Su goin' crazy (Goin' crazy)
And I ain't worried 'bout shit unless it's 'bout gettin' rich
It's eyes on me baby

[Verse 1]
Thumbin' through them big bills, erryday (Erryday)
I ain't worry 'bout shit unless it's 'bout gettin' paid
And I'm always on a plane (On a plane)
12 hours in your city, now I'm in a different state
I'm blessed, finnessed out the contract
Nigga who are you? Tell me where your boss at
So much hate (Hate), tell me where the love at
I'm lookin' for the jugg (Jugg), tell me where the plug at?
Kept rappin' 'cause it's payin' me well
I'm keepin' money, easy livin', call it KMEL
A lot of fake niggas prayin' we fail
I got a room full of bars, niggas think I'm a jail
You talk down instead of wishin' me well
Just got a check for big bands in the mail
I'm blowin' up now
Livin' it up now
Henny in my cup now (Yeah)
We the ones that get it started, never shut down
Ayy

[Chorus]
Ridin' 'round in the Bay (In the Bay)
New Su goin' crazy (Goin' crazy)
And I ain't worried 'bout shit unless it's 'bout gettin' rich
It's eyes on me baby
Ridin' 'round in the Bay (In the Bay)
New Su goin' crazy (Goin' crazy)
And I ain't worried 'bout shit unless it's 'bout gettin' rich
It's eyes on me baby

[Outro]
HBK, yeah you know how we play
And I can't quit, all I know is, all I know is
Yeah, HBK, yeah you know how we play
And I can't quit, all I know is, all I know is
Gang gang, gang gang gang
Gang gang gang, gang gang gang
Go gang gang, gang gang gang
Gang gang gang, gang gang gang
