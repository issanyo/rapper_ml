[Intro]
Young millionaire you dig me
Get your bands, get your, get your bands up
Young champion counting them millions you feel me

[Chorus]
If I ain't picked up then I'm on a plane
If I ain't ticked off then I'm with the gang
I got all the young boys rocking BAPE stuff
And they hating on the squad cause they ain't us
You were selling bricks I was selling hits
Just stuffed 10k in my [?] bitch (that money)
I made a million already
They compare me to forty and short already

[Verse 1]
Eyes on me sign to myself
Mixed the Goyard with the Louis belt (swag swag)
When the heat come you will really melt (lame)
Tell a hater he can kill himself
Real ones in the background
For the verse gotta tax now (that money)
Real one never changed up
Broke boy get your change up
From the bay never Hollywood (never)
Like milk do her body good
She got a fat fat but don't look good
Would I still do it man I probably would

[Chorus]
If I ain't picked up then I'm on a plane
If I ain't ticked off then I'm with the gang
I got all the young boys rocking BAPE stuff
And they hating on the squad cause they ain't us
You were selling bricks I was selling hits
Just stuffed 10k in my [?] bitch (that money)
I made a million already
They compare to forty and short already
