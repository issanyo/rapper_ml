[Intro]
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up [x5]
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much

[Hook x2]
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much

[Verse 1]
I'm the one people talk bout
6 speed on your fly
Guaranteed I bring the broads out
I'm a dog like a Rottweiler
But I'ma back when they talk in my face
They don't talk now
Had to switch a couple friends up
Had to go and get my ends up
To go and pick the Benz up
Not a loser, I'm a winner
I'm a certified star, they won't let me in the enda
I hit the corner to the W
Once you make a little money
All the honeys fall in love with you
Puttin' women over money
That's a dummy move
She playin' wifey on the gram
But hit a hunnid dudes
Real macks ain't goin' for that
Rather go and spend 80 on a Cadillac
Take her to the city, she don't know how to act, oh yeah
Steal the flow, I boomerang it right back, oh yeah

[Hook x2]
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much

[Verse 2]
When you workin' with some cash, yeah
Diamonds flash, yeah
40 large up in the stash, yeah
Got that bag, yeah
When I walk up in the bank, yeah
Do that Drake dance
When she walk, she make it shake, yeah
Double take, yeah
I be runnin' through my city, yeah
Feel like Diddy, yeah
Pray to God I'm really him while they fucking with me, yeah
I'm the one who puttin' on, yeah
Every song, yeah
We can get it on, yeah
Break of dawn, yeah
I'm just sticking to the G code
I'm in beast mode
Haters think I got a cheat code
I don't need those
Every beat I fucking with is in my tool box
Eyes on me like 2Pac
I got the keys, they telling me that it's piano time
Swear there was a day when it was ugly, they ain't see them times
Male groupies, we don't need them guys
We hit Seattle for the gas because it's legalized

[Outro x2]
They don't wanna see you boss up
So you know I had to boss up
Lil' Louie you don't cost much
Lil' Gucci you don't cost much
Ha-ha
