[Intro]:
Gang repping
Always on my job, ain't no half-stepping
Taking niggas money, yeah bitches 211
Taking niggas money, yeah bitches 211
Got[?] 211
Got 211
Taking niggas money, yeah bitches 211
Got 211
Got 211
Taking niggas money, yeah bitches 211

[Verse 1]:
Yeah
And when I'm up in the club it's a wrap
Ladies give me hugs, homies give me dap
You're standing in the line, I pull up in the back
Leave your girl around me, she might get jacked
Call me [?]
Pop that there and drop that butt low
Girl my money is humongo
I get more green than the jungle
I get more green like Vallejo, baby
I got guests for sale
If you take my side away from me
I get that dough with [braille?]
Man, these rappers so female
[?] leave no detail
It's the mob, no De Niro
Quote my job, like [?]
Niggas swear, that they real
But they fraud, what's the deal
They some broads, bet they swell
Hit the gym, [?]

[Bridge]:
Show me what that thang do
Baby, take your clothes off and let it hang loose
Gave your girl one wish, it never came true
She got it on me so you know I brought the gang through

[Chorus]:
Gang repping
Always on my job, ain't no half-stepping
Taking niggas money, yeah bitches 211
Taking niggas money, yeah bitches 211
Got[?] 211
Got 211
Taking niggas money, yeah bitches 211
Got 211
Got 211
Taking niggas money, yeah bitches 211

[Verse 2]:
After the club, I'm leaving early for a reason
