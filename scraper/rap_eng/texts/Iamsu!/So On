[Intro]
They don't believe you 'till you show 'em, you know
Yeah, HBK, yeah you know how we play
Yeah, and I can't quit, all I know is, all I know is
And I can't quit, yeah

[Hook]
I'm a hustler, I'll tell you what's mine
I'm so, I'm so on
Writing a couple plays at the same damn time
I'm so, I'm so on
Sitting back and just watching my moves
I'm so, I'm so on
You couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
I'm so, I'm so on

[Verse 1]
Late night in the studio, me and my bruhs
I never ever once thought that this would be what it was
Corner store every other day to gas the VW
I'm going back and forth to Hayward
Dropped out cause it sucked
In the back of the class, hoodie up, headphones
Ready to leave, hurry up, let's go
Shit was picking up, but it still wasn't easy
40 dropped Function, now I'm on TV
Now I'm on my first flight to NYC
I was backstage sweating, me and YG
Those were the days I would never see again
World Trade Center Hilton, it was me and Sam
Yeah, same day I dropped Kilt 1
Ay, pray for it and it will come
'Cause that's the way it go
Willing stretch, trynna find a song for radio
But they ain't play me though
I went back in the kitchen, had to give 'em what they need
Me and Jay went Stoopid, I turned Suzy 6 Speed
My own little movement, I see it picking up steam
They switching up teams, trynna kick it with me

[Hook]
I'm a hustler, I'll tell you what's mine
I'm so, I'm so on
Writing a couple plays at the same damn time
I'm so, I'm so on
Sitting back and just watching my moves
I'm so, I'm so on
You couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
I'm so, I'm so on

[Bridge]
Cheif's house was the trap house
I'm on Limelinx putting slaps out
Yeah, Kilt 1 was the warm up
Kristen picked me up in a Honda

[Verse 2]
San Jo, two shows, one night
We was running a promota
Overpay me still wanted seven hunnid
Trust me I got it for you, trust and believe
If you ain't got it, I can spot it for ya
Niggas believe in anything, I guess they not as loyal
As I though they was, I can't call you 'cause I'm in [?]
Got my dollas up in to three different continents
Ain't no accolades or awards for my accomplishments
I'm on some popping shit
And now they hating, really thinking that they stopping shit
I'm on it all for playing, head to where the profit is
Come to my city, I'll show you where the profit is
Blood, sweat, cry for this
Niggas ain't hot as us

[Hook]
I'm a hustler, I'll tell you what's mine
I'm so, I'm so on
Writing a couple plays at the same damn time
I'm so, I'm so on
Sitting back and just watching my moves
I'm so, I'm so on
You couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
I'm so, I'm so on
