Oh....Su!
And I know what to do with it

[Verse 1]
Call my phone
Imma come running to you
I know it's been a minute
But you like I never knew you
I'm already light
High heels on
I don't see nothing wrong with it
With an arrow
Take off your cool
Love all night
Then I wake up to you
And make-up is usually what we break-up to do
Give it to you in the kitchen just to change up the room
So good wish that I could pack a doggie bag
I like the little trick you did
Remember when I taught you that?
Never with the games
I felt like playing with your heart was whack
It was so good a normal man would have a heart attack
You want it and I deliver
When see rivers that's when she quivers
And shakes like she was from Harlem
Give it to you real good
That's no problem

[Hook]
Yeah
You ain't gotta guess
Girl you already know that
(I know what to do with it)
Yeah
You ain't gotta guess
Girl you already know that
(I know what to do with it)
Yeah
You ain't gotta guess
Girl you already know that
(I know what to do with it)
Yeah
You ain't gotta guess
Girl you already know that
(I know what to do with it)

[Verse 2]
Oh, Imma put this dentro
She gon' take your pants off
When I play this poetry you bring your body close to me
Show me how you like it
That's how Imma do it
I know you're not a pro
So baby let me walk you through it
Oh, I put it down, down
You know I want your body right now, now
Girl let me put you on like a coat in the winter
And the way you throw it back
Baby girl you're a winner
Oh, I'm going down, Mary
Make your girl scream so loud it's scary
Yeah, let's play doctor
In your body
Breaking you off possibly
Some Mavin Gaye
Some Luther Vandross
A little Anita
And we gon' set this party up
Some Mavin Gaye
Some Luther Vandross
A little Anita
And we gon' set this party up

[Hook]
Alright
You ain't gotta guess
Girl you already know that
(I know what to do with it)
Yeah
You ain't gotta guess
Girl you already know that
(I know what to do with it)
Yeah
You ain't gotta guess
Girl you already know that
(I know what to do with it)
Yeah
You ain't gotta guess
Girl you already know that
(I know what to do with it)
Oh

[Outro]
And I know what to do with it
And I know what to do with it
And I know what to do with it
And I know what to do with it
And I know what to do with it

(And I know what to do with it)
(And I know what to do with it)
(And I know what to do with it)
(And I know what to do with it)
