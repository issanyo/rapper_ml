[Verse 1: Fresco]
Oh, I just came through the back door
Better be careful what you ask for
'Cause you might fuck 'round and get it
You wanted to live this rap life
Better just make sure you keeping it one hunnid, one hunnid
Then fuck what you grow up when I don't know who you bluffing
This shit is not a game, my nigga
Flip the whole bankroll
At a hoe, [?]
Everything is alright, okay
Send the Add with the Henny my way
I'm in the zone, fuck her on our first date
She throw it back for a nigga all day
Everything is alright, woo

We alright
Everything is alright, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Fresco]
No, I never come to the front door
20 bottles, is that too much to ask for?
Tell 'em they better go get it
I'm celebrating with my niggas
Putting it on for my city
We one hunnid, one hunnid
They put in the field but I hit the ground running
Talking fortune and fame, my nigga
They tell me I'm a hot shot
How I keep this shit coming
Everything is alright, okay

I'm in the zone, I can do this all (all day)
Them Cartier's tell me about the sun rays

[Verse 3: IamSu!]
(IamSu!)
I don't fuck with you niggas
Got no love for you hoes
Money over the bitches
That's the way that shit goes and I know
I get spotted everywhere that I go
Can't sleep with one eye closed
That ain't the life that I chose, no
And I ain't with that bullshit, you know I ain't one
I put it on for the Bay, 'cause that's where I came from
I swear these niggas gay how they running their tongue
I'm trying to step different like a fucking [?]
Smoking purple haze got me [?]
Now I'm the game [?]
You ain't ready for the change up, they stack your game up
As soon as they brought my name up, they tryna [?] on me
No, we don't like that
[?] bitches DM's, bet they write back
I don't write raps, lil' nigga, I write facts
Smoking stronger than raw, don't do no white cash

Everything is alright
We alright
Everything is alright, yeah yeah yeah yeah
