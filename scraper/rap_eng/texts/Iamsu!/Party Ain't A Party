[Verse 1: J Rand]
Fresh kicks, fresh cut, bout to roll out
Pull up on the scene, pull the Roll' out
Shawty in the nipple print shirt
Is she happy to see me or is it cold out?
I got chicks in my section
I got drinks in my section
So much diamonds in my necklace
I think I'm gonna need protection

[Pre-Hook: J Rand]
Gone 'head girl, twerk it all on me
I need it for you to work it all on me
We ain't leavin' 'til the sun come up, baby
Came to do this here all night long

[Hook: J Rand]
A party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party
If I leave 'em in the club
I take it straight back to the lobby
Now shawty with the booty dancing like she wanna do me
Turn around, is she bad?
Damn right, I let her do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
If you bad, turn around girl, let me see you do it

[Verse 2: J Rand]
Damn, liquor courage got me so gone
I just wanna fuck, yeah, I'm so wrong
And we don't need to go far
I got a black car, ain't that what you're here fo'?
Girl, is you wid it, I got cash
Poppin' models skirt, shake that ass
That beat up go like ya know me(?)
Cuz you already know that I need that

[Pre-Hook: J Rand]
Gone 'head girl, twerk it all on me
I need it for you to work it all on me
We ain't leavin' 'til the sun come up, baby
Came to do this here all night long

[Hook: J Rand]
A party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party
If I leave 'em in the club
I take it straight back to the lobby
Now shawty with the booty dancing like she wanna do me
Turn around, is she bad?
Damn right, I let her do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
If you bad, turn around girl, let me see you do it

[Bridge: J Rand]
I don't want to hold yo hand
Cuz tonight I've got other plans
I just wanna say you've got me bad
That calm, in here for cash
Love and ass

[Verse 3: IAMSU!]
Heartbreak, we turn it up every place we go
Throw these ones in the air, make her H2O (wet)
Offtop when I meet the freak
We're goin' dumb like kick the sneaker
Bad boy, young suzy goin' aye day pay day
Everyday where I stay, yo in California my state
I pay top dollar for the clothes I wear
Hold up, some hoes in there
Tell her look back at it
She say I'm straight forward
But if I throw a stack at it
Will ya bend it ova? Girl!

[Hook: J Rand]
A party ain't a party 'til I get up in the party
If I leave 'em in the club
I take it straight back to the lobby
Now shawty with the booty dancing like she wanna do me
Turn around, is she bad?
Damn right, I let her do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
Turn around girl, lemme see you do it
If you bad, turn around girl, let me see you do it
