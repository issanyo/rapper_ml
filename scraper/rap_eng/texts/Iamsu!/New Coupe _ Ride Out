[New Coupe]
Yea, yea
I just hopped out the motherfucking Coupe
Drip just like a sliced fruit
Niggas can't do what I do
At the award show with my mom, dukes
Ridin with my skinny mini, she a size two
Malibu with no bu, with my new boo
Ridin with my skinny mini, she a size two
Malibu with no bu, with my new boo, yea

Grass seers, grey seers, nigga's can't see us
Ice like glaciers, nigga's can't see us
Sak's Fifth, pull me down --
You just got yours, we at next years
I'ma flex yea, diamond neck, yea
Draymond with the tech yea, new pro tech, yea
Label cut the check yea, I collect, yea
Crazy in that cat, take her to the vet, yea

I just hopped out the motherfucking Coupe
Drip just like a sliced fruit
Niggas can't do what I do
At the award show with my mom, dukes
Ridin with my skinny mini, she a size two
Malibu with no bu, with my new boo
Ridin with my skinny mini, she a size two
Malibu with no bu, with my new boo, yea

[Ride Out]
I can ride around the city when I want to
I put chrome twenty-fours' on my old school, I know
They don't want you
To be the man like I am, take a stand like I am
Ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out

I got an itchin for the dollars
Fetish for the paper
I don't talk much but my vibe is a fashion statement
Eight-eighty doin eighty in the slow lane
Hit em where it hurts, no pain no gain
This is God's plan, ain't do it by myself man
I'm just confident like I planned out the whole thing, yea
I need a foreign with the leather guts, yea
Neosporin how I'm in the cut
I give em hell before I give it up
And since I only got one, I'ma live it up, yea
I'ma represent the city I was made in
Lane changin, diamond and ice weighing in

I can ride around the city when I want to
I put chrome twenty-fours' on my old school, I know
They don't want you
To be the man like I am, take a stand like I am
Ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out
Ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out, ride out
