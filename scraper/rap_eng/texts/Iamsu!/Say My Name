[Intro: IAmSu!]
Yeah
Every single time

[Hook: IAmSu!]
Its HBK, I make major moves for my gang
My threes, I do them with the gas and then I switch lanes
When you say my name
My name, my name, my name
Baby say my name
My name, my name, my name

[Verse 1: IAmSu!]
Boof gang, I cook though
Imma kill 'em every hook though (Whoa-Whoa)
This one for the books though
We got all these rappers shook though (Whoa-Whoa)
Three fingers, that's my good pose
They say that's a good look though (Whoa-Whoa)
Roll it up, that's what she good for
Special shout out to the hood hoes (Whoa-Whoa)
Stack the money, make it flick though
My checks looking like zip codes (Whoa-Whoa)
Plus I stable on a good show
Sold out back to back in 'Frisco (Whoa-Whoa)
I been chilling with your bitch though
I been bussin' like a pistol (Whoa-Whoa)
Leather soft when you sit though
I'm just tryna get rich though (Whoa-Whoa)

[Hook: IAmSu!]

[Verse 2: HBK CJ]
Baby girl you looking thick though
Had to take a second look though (Whoa-Whoa)
Mix the Henny with the hypno
Got me walkin' with a dip though (Whoa-Whoa)
I got the world in my fist though
Yeah, that's why I keep my fist closed (Whoa-Whoa)
She gon' do it for the clique though
Heartbreak Gang on her nipple (Whoa-Whoa)

[Verse 3: Azure]
I can run for the whistle
Reel a man like a fish-pole (Whoa-Whoa)
Hold up nigga, whats that issue
You want my shoes, but they don't fit you (Whoa-Whoa)
Man, you better watch your temper

Pop a pitch, you get a whiff though, (Oh-Oh)
