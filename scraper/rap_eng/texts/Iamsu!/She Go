She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy

[Verse 1: Skipper]
Watch me pull up on lil baby like a Nascar
I tell her "Back it up and dunk it like an All-Star"
"You keep on doin' what you're doin' you might go far"
She wanna lick it, let me stamp it like a postcard
She go so hard, she in that Goyard
Her ex nigga in the way, he tryna bogard
We hit the club and make a movie, she my co-star
And plus she into pullin' bitches so she's both of ours
And she shaped just like a bottle of that Cola
So everytime she wanna see me I'ma pull up
Hey, do her thang so I go hard for my lady
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard
That's my baby

[Hook: Skipper]
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy
That's my broad, that's my lady
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy
That's my broad, that's my lady
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy
That's my broad, that's my lady
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy
That's my broad, that's my lady

[Verse 2: Jay Ant]
Let me hollala, let me holla at you
I might throw a couple blue dollas at you
I'm the only one nobody goin' after
Aye, you the only one I'm goin' after
Aye, lil baby, you go so crazy
It's almost crazy
I beat it up like you owe me, you forgot to pay me
I tax that when I wax that with a bra strap
Throw it back like the year over and my tax back
Hey, I respect you cause you respect yourself
Love the way you think, how you express yourself
Anything you want you should let yourself
Have it, grab it, turn it over, stab it

[Hook: Skipper]
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy
That's my broad, that's my lady
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy
That's my broad, that's my lady
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy
That's my broad, that's my lady
She go stupid, she go dumb, she go hard, she go crazy
That's my broad, that's my lady
