VERSE:

Lets take it back to the start
I was falling hard, you knew what it was
Look at what you do right now
Look at that you did right now
Gave my world totally
Only to find out i wasn’t enough
Look at what you did right now
Look at what you did right now
Fast forward

Been with him for a minute
Committed
Good guy, and i mean it
Everything i want and i needed
But now i find it hard to trust a nigga
And now i cause the pain instead of endure
I don’t know how to trust anymore
And i got another guy on the go
And nah, i wouldn’t call me a ho
But yo

CHOURS:

It’s a real damn shame
Cause ima be a playa for life
Ima be a playa for life
For life
What you do to me
Did me so wrong and now
I think ima be a playa, playa for life

VERSE:

Back, back to the beginning
I swear i wanted to have your kids and
I feel like a fool right now
Look at what you do right now
All the while you had two on the go
And to hear her voice on the telephone
The way that i found out
Look and what you do right now
Fast forward

I heard you said that you regret it
It don’t change the fact that i’m affected
Niggas always thinking that they got me
Not me
I will never wear my heart on my sleeve
And now i play the game with hearts galore
Cause i don’t know how to trust anymore
Good girl gone bad no one can undo
Only one to blame is you, and

CHOURS:

It’s a real damn shame
Cause ima be a playa for life
Ima be a playa for life
For life
What you do to me
Did me so wrong and now
I think ima be a playa, playa for life

Miss Rochelle, carry yourself so well
You presence is a gift, marry christmas
Noel
But i’ve been everywhere but home
Doing show, writing songs
Probably not answering phones, try not to string you along
And it makes it hard to think sometimes
I’m smoking everyday it makes me drink sometimes
With that combined with our energy, draw sympathy
Classic, like a symphony
Girls tryin to get with me, and take my focus
But i refused to give a dime to a broke bitch
And every other girl i find, got me hopeless
I’m trying to give her piece of mind when i wrote this
I’m living doing me, and maybe you could see
I really hope that you can be everything you believe
Cause i believe in you
And as crazy as it sounds it’s true
Being a playa is what i’m bound to do
Aye aye!


CHOURS:

It’s a real damn shame
Cause ima be a playa for life
Ima be a playa for life
For life
What you do to me
Did me so wrong and now
I think ima be a playa, playa for life
