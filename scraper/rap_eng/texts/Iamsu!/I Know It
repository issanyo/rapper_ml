[Verse 1]
All of my real ones link up
We hit your city with the brinks truck
So many people switched up
We been through everything that you could think of
They try to hit me with the "okey dokey," man the 52 fake out
They didn't know that I was saucy, saucy, man I got too much flavor
Yeah, yeah, take notes
I could show you boys how to stay afloat

[Bridge]
Eyes on Me, eyes open
Mind on it, I'm focused
I cook up, that potion
Ride on me, slow motion
I always get my way
All I have to say is

[Hook]
I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it
I glowed up, you know it
I glowed up, you know it
I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it
I glowed up, you know it
I glowed up, you know it

[Verse 2]
She asked me I'm in the studio, I'm like "roger, copy"
I play my girl that Kehlani, she give tsunami-nami
You think that she catch me cheating, I'm like "not me, not me"
But if I'm slipping on Instagram, then she prolly caught me
Look man, I know it, I'm open
3-pointer, I'm scoring
Can't do a regular, that's boring
I need foreign whips, painted orange
And Imma do whatever it takes for my crew to win
You ain't bout that life that you sayin' I knew it then
Throw you in that water, you either sink or you swim
Throw me in that water, I'm growing gills and some fins

[Bridge]
Cause I know it, eyes open
Eyes on Me, I'm focused
I cook up, that potion
Ride on me, slow motion

[Hook]
I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it
I glowed up, you know it
I glowed up, you know it
I know it, I know it
I know it, I know it
I glowed up, you know it
I glowed up, you know it
