[Verse: IamSU!]
These niggas won’t hold me back
These niggas won’t hold me back
Check your sources, check your facts
You lames get no respect in rap
I pull up in that extra black
Baddest bitch right next to that
Driver seat she ride with me
I probably won’t text her back
Writing on my iPad, stunting on your jive ads
Niggas broke down on the road, I just drive past
Extra slow, extra smoke
These niggas is extra broke
All about my green, so I always eat my vegetables
It’s that extra special flow
Young extraterrestrial
Young, but I’m professional
Don’t believe me, stretch with no
HBK the gang
I’m so dangerous with all these change I blow
Don’t trip off no bitch
Because these hoes is interchangeable
They know me, every place i go, i be on vacation so
Much like I'm  retired, man
I’m higher than a plane could go
Cliché I know, may I go?
More in debt, stucy sweats
Gold teeth, Olympic 6’s
I don’t taking in  winning steps
I been a threat, since the 6th grade
Niggas get paid in the Rich, moved out
But I still remember it
Too legit, hammer time
Puff hat, camouflage
Run the game, damn I’m tired
Turn me up, amplifier
Hotter than a camping fire
Cannabis to Mary Blige, plenty
Giving fashion tips, slim fits, over skinnies
I don’t wear no griffies, yeah I got a afro
Like the black folk in the 60’s
Tell me if you with me, maybe we go further
Eating niggas beefing, I ain’t never had no burger
Waiting on that merger, finna to get that cake
All these hoes screaming for me,  like a nigga drake
Niggas hating on me
They act like a nigga fake
See a nigga eating
Try to steal off of my plate

[Hook: Rossi] (x2)
My feet clear coming
Drop down, riding round, everyday I hold it down
We don’t do no fronting, now no baking on my drive now
Drop down, riding round, everyday I hold it down
We don’t do no fronting, now no baking on my stop now
