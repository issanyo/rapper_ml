[Verse 1]
Yeah, where that bag at
I need 50 for a show, where that cash at
She from Sacramento, threw her on that Amtrak
Even though I'm getting paper like a damn fax
Yeah, all the cougars say I'm handsome
Oakland airport, taking pictures when I'm landed
Bad bitch magnet, Ray got me dancing
Pull up with gorillas like it's animal planet
We big mobbin', now she plottin'
The gear in the whip like my trip's exotic
I be riding everywhere, I ain't hiding
I be styling, with them stylists, cut her off 'cause she was childish
Yeah I'm bout it, floss I got it, got that product in my pocket
G-Star jeans got really deep pockets
Cross faded in the club, head nodding
Touch the bag, run it back, get it poppin'
And my momma riding Louie for her luggage
Looked him in his eyes and I knew that he was bluffing
20 cash O, blow a check like it was nothing
Not from the D, but I'm Cartier buffing
Yeah, now I need 20 for a feature
And I really got it, out the swamp, I'm a creature
Hella smart 'cause my momma was a teacher
Never sleeping, eyes open 'cause I know these niggas leeches
I'm a beast and everything these rapper saying is facetious
All cash for my whip it ain't no leases, got my pink slips
That's on everything, I promise I'm gon' run it up
Yeah I made a lot of money, but it's not enough
All I got is time for it, that's the bottom line
Won't spit a flow without no dollar signs, and that not a lie
Yeah, got it poppin' in the Rich
She choosin', but I ain't tryna knock a nigga bitch
That's foolish, I'm all about my profit, gettin' rich
Used to it, so really you are not surprised as shit
I was raised different, live by a set of rules
I'm a boss, shit don't move, it don't get approved
Lotta drank, lotta food, and a lotta jewels
Seen your section in the club, it's a lotta dudes
Something gotta move, I'mma make it all shake
The bay in good hands, call me Suzy Allstate
I'mma make you jump like a ball fake
I do not respect they rhythm cause the all fake, ay
Yeah, and they all hate
Frank Sinatra of this shit I did it my way
