[Hook: The Kid Ryan]
I ride solo
I shine, I glow
I'm not playin' with you no more
I'm not playin' with you no more
I ride solo
I shine, I glow
I'm not playin' with you no more
I'm not playin' with you no more

[Verse 1: Prince Sole]
I ain't done turning up bitch, oooh nah nah
I'm in the kitchen cooking flickin' wrists (Where you at?)
San Jos√© back up to the Rich
We just tryna ball, we just tryna win, what you finna do?
And I'ma stay and they don't even call yet
(What you talkin' 'bout?)
I'm tryna find your bitch, you're right here
(What you talkin' 'bout?)
Your bitch is gonna tell me that I'm changed up
But she wanna fuck with me
And we're coming young, shawty's working, call me Young Sole
I don't kill every thing for man and [?]
From the Bay in the Valley, I'm swearing bitches like [?]
She's swearing I'm pushin' in the LA, I'm talking higher as me
And bitch I'm big timing, bitch I'm big timing
I don't know why they keep talking 'bout timing
And Suzy been rockin' since my spit
Mamacita said my flow picante

[Verse 2: IamSu!]

And you be calling me Suzy Six Speed, call me IamSu (Ayy)
