[Verse 1: IamSu!]
Turn it up [?]
In this thing repping Heart Breakers all day
Mobbing, Sudy man what they call me
Walk in night time walk out morning
Ooh, supper club on a Tuesday
Yeah, hit Oynx out in Houston
Ugh, hit room service ATL
I be out in New York homie raising hell
Counting money like a bank no limit like a tank
I'ma soilder tell these haters follow rank
Can't stop don't stop that's the motto that we live by
Get high, ball like AI
May I introduce you to my K9s
Cause I got my dogs with me like Vic
Shortie quite thick, stupid even
And we she walk by no I can't believe it (Aye!)

[Hook]
She know I got it I got it
Cause I walk around this bitch throwing
Money like I don't care, don't care
No no don't care
And I know all my homies gonna feel this feel this
You now rocking with the realest
And I know all my homies gonna feel this feel this
You now rocking with the realest nigga

[Verse 2: Problem]
Diamond Lane shit HBK
Guarantee this gonnna crack Bakersoul meets Yay
Saw time mother fucker let my rollie sway
Side to side, all up in these police face
Cause we the niggas now bitch, you better learn about it
Bringing pussies pain, bitches heard about it
Bitches heard about it, I make her squirt about it
Grab the jimmy and work it out p-p-palatis
Shout out my brother Suzy, shout out my brother Lucky
Bitches wanna fuck me cause I'm in pussies doing dougies
Smoking the best dope, saying the best quotes
Killing rooms no brooms but got the fresh flows, oh no
W-W-What still in the hood though
Like an engine tension then a hood show
Real fast bitch, I got class bitch
I get high then you might get your ass-

[Hook]
