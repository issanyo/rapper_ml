* EP on Red Hook Records

[Shabazz The Disciple]
Impressive times, everybody lives the fast life
Running around, selling drugs, living trife
In order to survive, we have to strive
For perfection and have a direction to guide
The young ones, out of the darkness of reality
It's rap standing for this mic brutality
Cuz if we don't got them, where will they end up
In a situation where they get sent up
For selling drugs or possession of weapons
Forcing and sending thier own mankind back to the essence
Bust shots at the cops for props
Low down shots, run the spots
So, I'm damn near every block
Making it hard to live at your residence
Brothers who kill brothers for past experience
Let me break it down to my point of view
Designed for a white man who didn't die for you
I know money is the roots of all evil
And worst is the devil, it controls people
It has your mind in a state, so negative
That to get more, you'll even murder your relatives
The drug game took a lot of my brothers
And others, but all I could do was think about their mothers
They can't bear that thought that their son was shot dead
In the ghetto, on the ground with holes in his head
All those years of chastizing, advising
He really wasn't realizing and open his eyes
And looking at life as a meaningfull experience
And take the dreams a lot more serious
Stop pleading for the opposite race
Taking life for a waste and chase in space
The latter of success is what we have to climb
With the strong mind and yo, take your time

[Chorus: "sample", Shabazz The Disciple]
"Take your time, young man"
Take your time, all you gotta do is just take your time
"Don't you rush to get old"
"Take your time, young man"
Eh, yo, take your time
"Don't you rush to get old"

[Shabazz The Disciple]
Sometiems, I just sit back and wonder
What can I do to keep myself from going under
In the ghetto, yo, it's hard to stay alive
So I keep a strong mind and strive to survive
Seems hard at times, but I guess I slipped
Cuz I'm here and my mind is equipped
I walk past the brothers that be dealing
And a negative eye appears glady appealing
They drive fancy cars tinted up with a kit
How many brothers did they kill to get it
They rule the streets on a temporary basis
And everyday they live life at fast paces
And in the end they go out and fight caucasians
Peep smiles on the white mans faces
You sell drugs, brother, I don't have to
I'd rather make fly beats I could rap to
Red Hook is infested with capsules
But that's one lifestyle I can't adapt to
Because the living is lame, who's to blame
It's damn shame, but after you're illusion to maintain
And entertain, so use your brain
Stop walking all around as if your brain has been drained
Stop rushing to get to the top
Cuz you might get shot or knocked by the cops
Then you'll be sitting in the cell everyday
Reminiscing about your life and how you could've got away
The only way that you could've escaped
Is if you wouldn't have got yourself involved in the first place
But it's too damn late to think backwards
Think about the sentance you're about to get slapped with
So, young brothers, here's a reason to think
About how the positive rise and the negative stink
They'll become memories of the past
The main reason's cuz they're living their lives too fast
The latter of success is what we have to climb
So, orcastrate line and yo, take your time

[Chorus: "sample", Shabazz The Disciple]
"Take your time, young man"
Take your time, all you gotta do is just take your time
"Don't you rush to get old"
"Take your time, young man"
Just take your time
"Don't you rush to get old"

[Shabazz The Disciple]
As the world revolves, our people dissolve
Create more problems not getting solved
We struggle just to survive
We struggle to stay alive
Innocent are dead, our freedom is deprived
Kinifes in fear, yo, we all under stand this
Freedom, not death, yo, all must ammend this
Your minds were diluted, heavily polluted
As far as I'm concerned, we've all been excluded
Took of our knowledge, but I'm here to speak it
Your must love it, before you must seek it
Destroy devilish snakes and never be a rebel
Instead of all of us falling victim to the devil
Don't let them hold you, don't let them control you
Don't let no one in the negative state of mind own you
Don't fall for the tricks of the 666
Cuz they first specialized in the crucifix
Now is the time to strive and be wise
Where we reach the horizon and we all disguising
It's up to us to keep the strong mind
So that the light can shine on all mankind
Take surprise and in your grands, young man
But hwatever you have to do, take your time
Listen up boy and take your time

[Chorus: "sample", Shabazz The Disciple]
"Take your time, young man"
"Don't you rush to get old"
"Take your time, young man"
Eh, yo, take your time
"Don't you rush to get old"
"Take your time, young man"
"Don't you rush to get old"
