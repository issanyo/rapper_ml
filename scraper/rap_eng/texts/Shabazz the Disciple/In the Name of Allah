[Intro: Method Man]
Shout out to Morocco, what's going down?
This your boy, MEF, Mr. that is
Capital M, capital E, capital F
I'm here to speak upon things, one of your hometown favorites
My boy Cilvaringz, doing big things upon this
We gon' make it pop like this
Ya'll wanna see what time it izzy
Man, this is in the name of Allah
RZA, Shabazz the Disciple, Masta Killa
Killah Priest, your boy John-John Blazini
Let's do it

[Masta Killa:]
Listen, the wise elder spoke, write as I quote
Then open the seal, and reveal these things
That will come to pass, if you can last through the storm
Man will be tested in all forms
Then flesh will be beaten until submission
Forgiveness has been given to spare your life
Still your eyes glaze when you greet my wife
Sinful thinking, it's strong wine and drinking
Lead to the destruction of such men as Samson
The grace period given for those who will repent
Those other than righteous, Masta Killa will send
And time is at hand, as I walk the land
From the U.K., back to the streets of B.K
Given sight beyond sight, to write the unseen
No amount of treasure can measure the gift given
To speak the unspoken, it's the chosen

[Killah Priest:]
I need one cup of Dracula's blood, two virgins
Dressed in all black, to start my sermon
One heart of a merchant, one teeth of a priest
The head of a monk, mixed in a bowl, with the 9/11 souls
I see him in the sign as the reverend was told
I read the scroll, but I'm still blindfold
Wait, I need more ingredients, so I look for the seeds of disobedience
Chop off the foot of Bush, throw him in the pot, let him cook
To every word I jot in this book, I pray the FBI's overlook
The recipe for America's destiny
Tech will squeeze, after dragging, I stab him in the abdomen
Free the Palestinians, free the Africans
Free humanity from the insanity, our planet bleeds
Mission cycles of symbols and idols
Our skin put Bibles, Qu' Ran, been through temples to old mosque
Stepping through the Garden of Eden where the revengeful angels throw rods
Oh God, save us from the outrageous Pagans, I spray guns, til the barrel's empty
I'm like Moses to Pharaoh's envy, turn of the century
Burning in misery, think...

[Hook x2: Shabazz the Disciple]
In the, name of Allah, who we give thanks and praises
They turn us from the wages, watch over your saviors
He gave us life, made us upright and raised us
He wrote the book, we live according to your pages

[Killah Priest:]
When the holy father spit, you see the bottomless pit
Demons rise out, Shabazz close the door, this God's house

[Salah Edin praying]

[RZA:]
Titanium fangs, skull nearly mammal
At the holy city of Mecca, on the back of a talking camel
Grey Flannel Cologne, crazy ammo get blown
Wherever I sit son, that is my throne
I'm the reason why time started, I be the kind hearted
Trying to bust me, you aiming at a blind target
Designed with a sublime for the vintage
I control the whole, don't deal with no percentage
Even with a 3.5 mil deposit
Your life is still illusive like a CGI composite
Where your mind and your body discombobulate
Need to regenerate, let your mental seed ovulate
For nine months, in the womb of my wisdom
You may find a program to descramble the system
And cause a glitch, whether bright day or black pitch
We strive to build homes, and stack chips
From the ice of Alaska, to the heat of Calabasas
We over through the master, he build our own castle
Remove the impostor, take it up an octave
As my vibe continues to energize your chakras
Out of Allah mercy, I speak these verses
To help bring the truth from beneath the surface
To help get the proof, from beneath the churches
Defeat Shaitan, and complete the circle

[Cilvaringz:]
I move with a strike of elegance
Like Saladin on a horse, backed by seraphim
Where flowers open and my past and unruled is downhill
But see, I'm quick to the back
The fate for the house of Mecca, the stone of Abraham
My word alone will enslave a man
Deeply to the sword of Islam, though he resides with his mom
In the Pagan land, the shit's calm
Praying to the cross of Christ, what is right
But the Qu' Ran claims Christ never lost his life
To the crucified punishment of Roman justice
And that's why the Bible cannot be trusted

[Hook x2]

[Salah Edin praying]

[Outro: Shabazz the Disciple (Masta Killa)]
What up Prince Rakeem, Masta Killa, Cilvaringz
John Blaze, S.T.D., in the name of Allah
(Yo, yo, one-two, one-two, turn my mic up a little bit
Turn the headphones up just a little bit
Turn the frequency up a little, yo...)
