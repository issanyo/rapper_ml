[Hook]
Yo! we win the war cause we bomb first
It's like when napalm bursts, snipers with the Vietnam verse
Ghetto apostles doing god's work, boots and camouflage shirts
Marching through your trenches and your concerts
We win the war cause we bomb first
It's like when napalm bursts, snipers with the Vietnam verse
Ghetto apostles doing god's work, boots and camouflage shirts
Marching through your trenches and your concerts

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
I'm that guerilla in your midst, stalking with an army of assailants
I got your organization under surveillance
You moved your pawn two squares, left the king unveiled
Diagonal invasion, soldiers marching in for the kill
This is a war join ranks, play your position
Put the industry in checkmate, force them under submission
Ya whole perimeter's surrounded by my legion
You're trapped inside the center of an isolated region
Chk!, blaugh!!!, glass shatters, bullets scatter
No evidence or fingerprints a c12 matter
Black bishop moving in, attack the queen
Sabotage front line, the industry's in quarantine

[Verse 2: R.H. Bless]
This is your final call, prepare for violent storms, a silent war
Map your survival course
Mount ya riding horse and grab ya sword
Hip-Hop's a holocaust, grab ya holy cross, ya crescent and star
Witness ya empire fall like Sodom and Gomorrah
Refer to ya bibles, Qu'ran and Torah
Bless, I be the high exalter, divine curer, who mind is purer
Staring in my rivals eyes, I analyze, cross examine and paralyze
All those who choose to itemize lies

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freestyle]
Continued infiltration by fire bomb detination
Phasers and lasers scopin, choking from smoke inhilation
Secret service agents are coming at me
I gotta hit em I sprayed, throw a grenade
Setting off the sprinkler system

Verse 4: [Poetic]
I specialize in fear, terrorizing your airwaves
Like dropping off thermo-nuclear bombs in subways
Here to stress ya life, painting pictures of death
Ancient scriptures rip ya silhouette, I'm cold as winter
Bringing the earth tremors that burst ya inner sanctum
I sank men of war then haha, laughed at how I banged them
Foes copping a plea, should've took the opportunity to flee
I bring terror to fields like the phantom
My thoughts reveal a navy seal approaching ghetto wars
Enemies force field jackets get stained from open sores
Non-negotiable term for your surrender
I heat ya weak arsinol, and burn men to cinders

[Hook]

[Freestyle]
Rendezvous, special operations: team arsonists
Switch the disk and get out of there fast
We don't wanna take no risk
Code name: freestyle, alias "the asthmatic"
Automatic full metal jackets
Static's with the diplomatic, bureaucratic tactics
We got the area secured now, triple the c-4
And get of the whole floor, you copy?
I copy that, we got the whole music business wired
So when this shit blow, ya whole empire's expired

[R.H. Bless]
We can live lavish and still build on the mathematics
Far precise, cut cabbage, rock ice and still civilize a savage

[Shabazz]
Dancing in the Garden of Eden, gotta thank Allah I'm breathin
Glancing back at days I used to be behind them bars with heathens

[Poetic]
Flash like the Aztecs, cash checks, blast tecs
Collect all of my assets from sales from the cassettes

[Freestyle]
Iceless but priceless, top of the price list
Probably the 1st up on ya heist list
Ya might miss, so knowledge this...
