[Verse 1 : Shabazz The Disciple]
Fuck your MTV cribs in my father's house is many mansions
I'm patient with the remnant while you all sambas tap dancin'
Bearing my cross in the streets I can fix your lammy
Got away I dress and go against god to get the Grammy
Tempted by the industry twice
Offered the glory of the rap kingdom
We turned them down like Christ
They high exceeding ??? the penthouse at the label
Overlooking the city contract upon the table
They tell you bend over worship me
And it's ??? for the left side of the throne
Where you be financially stable
That's the shit that made demons out of angels
Turn brooks Cain ??? there's Judas at every table
Throwin' up the ??? and triple sixes
Warlocks and witches, ??? by worldly riches
You sold your soul
You thought you walked the streets paved with gold
Now you the scarecrow on a yellow brick road

[Hook]
I know now what I didn't know then (x3)
Savor those special moments

[Verse 2 : Godfather part. III]
Everything that glitter ain't gold
??? that'll rate little children for
How you sold your soul
Fuck mind ??? tell 'em lock and load
I protect my dome
Government body surface on Bohemian road
??? reaching ??? what you grasp me for?
World ruled by evil what the future hold?
Only time I tell, so I tell to those
Never sell your soul. stay free as a bird
Always reach for the stars, motherfuck what you heard
I was told as a youth, I would never be shit
Now worldwide time my ??? infamous
And I stuck to the grit like pot, friends have a shot
Android nigga flip they turn the site clutz
And they feed to the fans all script didn't tell you
From tell-a-vision and they downloaded digital

[Hook]
