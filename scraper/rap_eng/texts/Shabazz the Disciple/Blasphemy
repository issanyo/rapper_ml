[Hook]
Blasphemy they whisper in the dark of blasting me
Let he who has no sin bust the 1st shot after me
Blasphemy they whisper in the dark of blasting me
Let he who has no sin bust the 1st shot after me
Blasphemy they whisper in the dark of blasting me
Let he who has no sin bust the 1st shot after me
Blasphemy they whisper in the dark of blasting me
Let he who has no sin bust the 1st shot after me

[Verse One]
Yo, if there's a heaven in the afterlife, it's crowded in the cosmos
Only God knows, in my physical dwells Allah's ghost
Many mortals embody the spirit of diablo's
Of all the plagues in the ghetto
We're either dead or behind bars most
Unlike them lost souls, I chose the right path at my crossroad
My life is like the scripture that was foretold
As days pass I uphold the faith
Praying God don't close the gate
This life is deep, but I could hold the weight
March in my Jehovah souljah state
Where shaytan waits pon'
God's path wanting my soul as he lie in wait
Control the population with guns, drugs, diseases
Got my people acting evil, strung out on needles waiting for Jesus
Once made in the image of God who turned savages
Get murdered by the government gang with silver badges
I feel them assembling in the dark plotting to assail
I hear the banging, from them fastening my cross to the ground with nails

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I seek refuge from Allah from the one who is ecursive
If the devil didn't exist, then I wouldn't have a purpose
The prophecy must be fulfilled
See I already died my first death
Just cause a man is breathing, doesn't mean he has the breath
The angel of death be calling spirits out the physical
Take a look through the eyes of a disciple, shit is visual
Allah sharpened my peripheral
Blessed me with the gift of prophecy
So I can see the wickedness you hid in you
Raised amongst murderers and criminals, once a master crook
I already know what you thinking
I used to give victims the same look
Let he who has no sin cast the first stone
Cause when my peoples send you to me
You'll be my slave in the kingdom
Death is only but a breath away
I pray I don't get left astray
Many are they who seek to slay me like prey
I hear them whispering in the dark, plotting to assail
I hear them fastening my cross to the ground with nails
