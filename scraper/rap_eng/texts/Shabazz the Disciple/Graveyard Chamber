[Hook: The RZArector]
Danger danger, danger danger
The Graveyard Chamber
Danger danger, danger danger, danger danger
The Graveyard Chamber
Danger danger, danger danger
Enter the Graveyard Chamber
Danger danger Stranger is major
Enter the Graveyard Chamber!

[Verse 1: The Grym Reaper]
Ahh!! You're alone the night is dark you feel fear
You're lost, cold and confused, utterin' prayers
Afraid of the beast that stalk the Earth
You're prayin' to Jesus if cross don't work (Ha ha ha)
I've seen your type before
You read all the laws but scared to go to war
Timid and frail blind faith got ya geesed
You scorn the truth and adorn your beliefs
Are you aware, son?
There's nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Grym Reap comes with my dangerous tongue
I'm out of control like young kids with guns
Words distorted in a murderous thoughts
My profile is nasty as maggots in pork
I'm dark and damp, enough to rust amps
With the jaws of a vampire with rusty clamps

[Hook: The RZArector]
Danger danger, danger danger, danger danger, danger danger
It's the Graveyard Chamber!

[Verse 2: Dreddy Krueger]
I be the Bushwick Dutch Master rapper
I love black women and I hate fuckin' crackers
Check me yo, my breath stink cause I smoke skunk, punk
Everyday of the month in a Dutch Master fuckin' blunt
Bust the clich√©, niggas talkin' he-say-she-say
About me ya bitch-ass-niggas
Y'all not ass, y'all titty, y'all style is shitty
How dare you try to represent New York fuckin' City?
I been down since BVDs and do-rags, shelltops and shag
I was the little badass with regular and tre bags
Always tryin' to get shit I never had
'Cause times is bad like luck, that's why I don't give a fuck
I dig up my nose and my butt on the bus or the train
This is for niggas walkin' in the rain, listenin' to they Walkmane
Talkin' the New York fuckin' slang

[Hook: The RZArector]
Danger danger, danger danger, danger danger, danger danger
It's the Graveyard Chamber!

[Verse 3: The RZArector]
In the streets of New York, bullshit walk, cream talks
I be the giant on the top of your beanstalk
Wavin' Iron flags, baggin' crab niggas with bloody rags
Holdin' fat bags, takin' heavy drags
Then I add more shells to the mags
Shots goin' off, you gettin' caught like tag
The diamond crystal, I be rippin' up your flesh tissue
And have my pit bull lockin' on your bone gristle
Castin' shadows in every battle
I rabble words like scrabble, drag your brain through the gravel
At the speed of sound the rhyme travel
Allow me to dabble with a flow that's infallible
Maintain your order 'cause once I slaughter
I destroyed a whole city like Sodom and Gomorrah
Or Babylon, I'm runnin' shit like a marathon
Niggas frontin' Don with a set like Frank Avalon

[Verse 4: Shabazz the Disciple]
Shabazz is here to cause panic
Another fuckin' madman born to the planet
Sendin' niggas to the pearly gates
I'm psyched out, I got screws loose like Norman Bates
Shoot shit up like it's a gallery
Blowin' snakes heads off to earn me a salary
Devils choke from the gun smoke
Once I'm provoked, I shove a fifth long down ya throat
And let ya taste the steel
Another body unidentified shit from the Potter's field
Ya punk ass'll get out dramad
I'm swellin' devil's melons for my man Fard Muhammad
Get a crew and try to surround me, and one by one
I'll light y'all up and send ya asses to King's County
Sort of the morgue supplier
Ya want a nigga bang? Fuck Spenser, 'Bazz for hire

[Verse 5: The Gatekeeper]
Make room, the masculine Gatekeeper
Kicks suspense in a terrified form to keep you warm
You're tensed up, niggas get wrenched up on a rock
Limbs are whip-lashed, bodies are gettin' smashed
So, let the volcano blow and erupt
Destruction crept on, niggas are gettin' flipped on
Yeah, comin' after ya, huh I only got half a ya
Other part froze in Alaska
While define the feast a high beam
Ghost of a drug fiend a physical dreams I breathe steam
Thoughts are plutonic the chronic scripture
Angles and ripped ya, I get ya
Yo, I smash like a comet, punish then drain ya

[The RZArector]
Danger danger, danger danger

[Verse 6: Killah Priest]
I stalk the place like a leopard, the microphone shepherd
Is speakin' parables one and two, catch it
The brain counselor, track fertilizer
The murdalizer, you never heard it wiser
I open heads like the archives
Allow me to explain my brain in the darkside
I strike ya beam and watch it gleam
I'm solar, steadfast, patient like Noah
The rap cipher be the enlightener
Prey upon the weak, the strong I'm the sniper
And light that ass like gasoline
I dig through your chest like a jar of Vaseline
I leave your brain regurgitatin' and trampled
Until your rhymes are evaporated
I trip up a niggas thoughts with a pool of zodiac signs
And I slowly attack the mind
The Killah Priest will bend your ideas
I see you cry in fear, there's no survivin' here

[Hook: The RZArector x2]
Danger danger, danger danger, danger danger, danger danger
It's the Graveyard Chamber!

Danger danger, danger danger
