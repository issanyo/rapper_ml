[Shabazz the Disciple]
Wings up, Confessions of a T.H.U.G. Angel
Father forgive me for my transgression in my many obsession
Stretches for them grams and them hand weapons
'Cause rap abuse where every man's destined
I pray my season ain't here as sins I committed as an adolescent
We was consumed by a worldly possession
And when court was in session
Many got indicted for the night in question
I was the product of the hood recession
It's my confession
I understand I hindered my own blesses

'Cause so many widows in the midst they rove
I fasted and carried the casket of all their beloved
For it is by strong faith that I'm driven
Guided down the path where I know if not my ending
And when we reach the gate on that final day of ascending
Thou will be judged; man all of our cases is pending
Until I'm carried to my resting place, rose, bro'
I'm going hard for them front three roads I lead 'em on

(Outro) Bazz
