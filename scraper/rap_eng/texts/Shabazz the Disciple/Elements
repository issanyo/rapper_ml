[Intro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, disciples
Got the four elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of death
It's like that, Killah Priest

[\erse 1: Killah Priest]
I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain 'cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength like Hercules
Wisdom changes my continents
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burning me is like tryin to kosher a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhymes into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate in less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MCs fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome

[Break: Killah Priest]
Yeah, writing rhymes with a liquid pen
Next to appear be the holy wizards

[Verse 2: Shabazz the Disciple]
Knowledge I obtain is mystic, realistic
There's hidden gems in sins if you missed it
Thou have to contain the power to unravel
It's like walkin astray on the edge of Earth with no map to travel
Once false step, you enter the depths of darkness
The triple stage that's grave to the conscious
As I drag your mind off the edge of sanity
And leave you floating, you have to figure your way back to gravity
Taken beyond the orbits of NASA at rates much faster
Your chest tightens up like asthma
And you be gasping for oxygen
Inhaling fatal gas, light-headed from the hydrogen
Drifting in the wind like a cloud that can't rain
You lack the element so it's relevent to strain
Your brain lacks water like the Moon
Depending on the Earth since you first left the womb
Words engraved to paralyze you in the mental
Too much weight to analyze the potential
Amounts of pressure that'll tilt your scale
And as for 85's I describe it in braille
The blind language, the deaf and dumbâ€”I use sign language
'Cause I was blessed to exorcise stress and anguish
Niggas be straining with their sick sound-es
I'm spliting atoms and spilling holy water on their conscious
Travellin 186,000 miles per second
Then shine forth as far thoughts if you can catch 'em

[Verse 3: Hell Razah]
Life is Hell, Hell tells lies in your face
Every other day we're killing off our own race
When you trapped inside hate, it's hard to escape
Inside a slave mindstate 'cause you go out like a blind date
Surrounded by danger when you're living in the world full of anger
The pain I drop just to get you got is a brain strainer
Deadly talk, silent thoughts
I can't overstand when the man wanna live long
And you think too short and distorted
Paying for your religion when you really can't afford it
I'd rather live like a god than instead of dying for a devil
You couldn't climb this level with a ladder made of knowledge
I demolish, abolish, so don't try to follow
I'm looking through your body in the dark and I could tell you that you're hollow
You sleepwalking blind ass zombie
I Hell Raz' from the grave of ignorance
Just to finish men lookinf guilty as sin

[Verse 4: Prodigal Sunn]
Crying deep within the mental, my soul is intoxicated
Opressed with stress, aggravation, pain and frustration
I can't take it no more as I journey through the halls of Hell
Justice prevails, unrighteous will surely fail
Now may my enemies be defeated in the chambers
Of danger facin life full of strife, filled with anger
Forced to enter as an avenger of sin
I roar like the mighty lion as I contrive of Benjamin
Experimenting with all types of fucking gases
I got the potion to turn your flesh to fucking ashes
Atoms shatter and lemons start to scatter
Illusion dwelling in parable mental confusion
