[Intro: Hell Razah]
December 9th, 1974 - Glenn Grooms

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
At times I sit and wonder if you really hear me
I remember November 22nd very clearly
I was 14 a man barely
Came out the same school as Mr. Daily
Now it's God's grace and hail Mary
I'm tight leery, saw a burner and a Bible near me
The night I wrote this on this paper had my eyes teary
So we celebrate your life yearly
The way we lost G was unfairly and wary

[Interlude: Hell Razah]
Know'am'sayin'? This bugging me out right now
Just thinking about it
We doing this two days from your birthday, damn

[Verse 2: Hell Razah]
We use to slap box on poor block and bop cause our skully tops
You always gave Herbie props, walking to the barbershop
Knots in your sneaker box and really love cry a lot
You flip when they shot Charles, told me from my first charge
F train me and Todd held it down behind bars
You seen to have loyalty from that day we had a bond
Your legacy carry on, I still go and see your moms
Oh yeah you an uncle now, Jeremiah talking now

[Interlude: Hell Razah]
You got a nephew now baby
I could see you playing with 'em now

[Verse 3: Hell Razah]
Adrian and Mike miss ya, Lisa was your big sister
Moms still got the pictures, please tell Allah forgive us
Damn this gon' get me chills, it must've been God's will
But seeing you and my pops, both of y'all in Rosehill
Demons saying go kill, Angels saying go Bill
And open up the seal for the Twelve Tribes of Israel
I see your eyes every move, watching over all your goons
I wrote this in my living room, rest in peace Glenn Grooms...
November 22nd, 1991

[Verse 4: Shabazz the Disciple]
The Orbituary...
It was Tuesday August 21st, 1990
The day my life changed could never put this moment behind me
Ten in the morning he was making a sale
On Paradise where he lost his life, fresh outta jail
In '86 we bagged the first brick, we looked up to Kline
When you caught that gun charge we quoted lessons during phone time
My whole life flashed through your mind before you ascended
This one morning why you ain't practice 2nd Amendment?

[Interlude: Shabazz the Disciple]
C'mon Rob, man, don't go front on me man

[Verse 5: Shabazz the Disciple]
We ball our arms in the staircases clutching our palms
Saying a thug's prayer, walk with no fear, the Book of Psalms
Right now I'm saluting the God while I'm standing at this podium
With a black heart, eyes full of tears, tasted sodium
LP - you've been through a lot but God is with you
And when I make it heaven I'm coming back to get you
The Eulogy of Eric Barrier of Rakim
Hold me a place behind the gate man, you and Supreme

[Interlude: Shabazz the Disciple]
Rest in peace, Ms. Carroll and Sandra, damn

[Verse 6: Shabazz the Disciple]
He leaves to mourn the whole MPP
Little sis' Tutti, Erica and my man LP
Last time I saw you I tried to pull out your casket man
I smelled roses for seven days while I fasted man
I wish I could had them shells at your neck that went through you
Clip up, find a nigga who did it and send 'em to you
It was my worst day, my brother Ra last Earth day
We cremated him, August 26th on his birthday

[Outro: Shabazz the Disciple]
Word, me and Shakim was the last ones at your wake man
Word, they trying to close the casket man
I'm ready to... beat them niggas up man
Word, I'm looking at you, picking you up
He was bare foot with the suit on man
Yo, that was the most hardest thing I ever dealt with my life man
Word, and still can't even deal with it man

[Outro: Hell Razah]
Pss, I remember Glenn man
Remember he told us man; yo we gotta slow down man
Said one of us gon' get hurt real bad man
I ain't never though it was gon' be you man
Word
