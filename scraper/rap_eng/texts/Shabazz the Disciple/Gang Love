(Chorus) Razah (Bazz)
Bloods, Crips, sets and Latin Kings
I wanna see your wings
(Take the hood back)
The Black Panther Party
Muslim and Godbodies
Fuck Illuminati
(Take the hood back)
All the four corner hustlers
G.D.'s and Vice Lords
We swinging Christ swords
(Take the hood back)
All my Hebrew Israelites
With twenty-five to life
We be the sacrifice
(Take the hood back)

[Shabazz the Disciple]
Police do whatever the fuck they want
I don't see niggas shooting
All them guns in the hood
Y'all niggas scared of the revolution
This ain't our homeland
That ain't our flag you saluting
We disrespecting the grave of Malcolm and Huey Newton
(Wings up!!) T.H.U.G. Angelz gangbang for liberation
Putting our life up on the line for the black nation
From block to cell blockers worldwide affiliation
Fuck that!! Use them CO's as initiation
(It's all genocide)
Let them see what it feel like to bleed from them ox's
Let them niggas see what it feels like to be in them boxes
All my niggas gang-related but we Huey intentions
Middle finger to the law till the day of my sentence
FBI, CIA, them niggas is gangs
ATF, DEA, them niggas is gangs
All the Correctional Officers, them niggas is gangs
All the Police Officers, them niggas is gangs
You know the hood drill pipes bust from the pressure
Got my juvi's flagging up to gangbang on the oppressor
(Ghetto Government Officialz) I'mma G.G. OG
They wanna see me in the bing or see me OD
That ain't happening

(Chorus) Razah (Bazz)

[Hell Razah]
From the early 80's we was known for selling good crack
Now it's 08 we here to take the hood back
Some benefited, convicted, evil was drug addicted
They wanna use us to fix then kick us out the district
It's like we paying them rent to live inside a prison
Hilary Clinton is benefiting them politicians
If Russell Simmons is in it to get a small commission
The more daughters is stripping to pay their intuition
And sons pitching that ye' from off them wooden benches
Is they forgetting 'bout hood niggas for world riches
They sell a small apartments for one million
And that's the minimum next is condominiums
It's crime related from gang signs to mob tithes
We all sinners in God's eyes with heart cries
Too much pride is a dark side for smart guys
"The Overseers" is coming to open up our kids
They built the precinct and court where they could I.D. us
They try to give you a job to rob your ideas
The Dutch settle here, that's 500 years
Or more rebel kids living in the ghetto crib
That wanna take their hood back like Carmelo did

(Outro)

Razah: The Mexican Mafias
Bazz: Organize all these gangsters
Razah: The Young Lords
Bazz: In the hood
Both: Take the hood back
Razah: All the Rastafarian's
Bazz: Make 'em realize the enemy
Razah: Haitians, MS-13
Razah: No one is exempt from this revolution
Bazz: The Revolution will not be televised but it will be on YouTube
Both: Take the hood back
