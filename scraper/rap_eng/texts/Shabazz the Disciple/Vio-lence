What up Skizz?

[Verse 1: Lil' Fame]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died you probably vision me shot up
And laying on the stretcher
Cause I ain't the nigga that die from high blood pressure
My demise in the midst of a crime go fresher
Look at his eyes he's ready to die, Lord bless him
It is what it’s gonna be, ain't much that worry me
Can’t care whether is 20 of us or one of me
Gun boys ride with us, niggas still get yapped
Pistol whiped on all monitors, you know what time it is
Low nigga run up, squeeze a couple shots in your shirt
Touch your best out to see if it work (Brang! Brang!)
My niggas get high, get drunk, go ape
Whoop you out for about 20 minutes straight then we rotate
Straight put the beats on em, no brakes
Since way back in the days, nigga's name hold weight
And we still active, still mashin'
Still inspiring, still shining, still firing

[Hook: Lil' Fame]
Violence is a universal language
Nah nigga you done pick the wrong nigga to bang with
(Brang-brang!) We murder ya
BK nigga get down, the dirtiest, we bang
We give 'em the whole thang!

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died
You probably picture a hollow bursting out of a nine
And splattered me when it popped, jerked me out of my prime
My fam'll be mad of God, cursing out of the sky
If violence begets violence and death rules everything around me
Dreams are really nightmares, in King’s County
And even though my daughter was born here
Slaughter and war go on here
You'll get your fucking wig blown off here
Let's put the mirror to the violence, an electrify spirit
That defines visionary riots, military science, dignitary silence
Ambassadors are assassinated
From the war-room to the block assassinations are created
Murders are premeditated and orchestrated by a symphony conductor
Sort of when sawed-offs are spraying
The rhythm of the gun shots is like a song is playing
Speaking in the same tongue to God like to talk to Satan

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shabazz The Disciple]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died
You’d probably picture me slumped over the wheel in my ride
Drugs planted in the trunk, being accused of a crime
Orchestrated by COINTELPRO the FBI
? all on the dashboard, cause my spirits to fly
Wanna see me scalpel ride?? filled with formaldehyde
Police the modern day romans, stolen profits with nines
Like the prophets in black, leaders of what they prophesized
Hood Christ crucified, two G’s on my side
My peter’s heater a sly, cause my Judas demise
I pray I look my angel of death right in his eyes
You coming with me motherfucker, finish this beef in the sky
These last earth memories, the sight was frightening
Hear thunder when the hood Christ, striked the lightning
Ain’t no fuckin hail Mary’s, is hail of slugs
Brain dead on your deathbed, family pull the plug

[Hook]
