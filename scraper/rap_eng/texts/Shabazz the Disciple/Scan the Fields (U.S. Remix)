[Intro]
Yo, pyro report (Live)
Peep it (And the disciple)

[Couplet 1]
Observing the landscape through binoculars
Lieutenant firm handshakes, even the XXX
Drop bombs out your pops, moms and relatives
I'm the executive, I'm known for wrecking cribs
If the gun met your ribs, you think I'd let you live?
No one can stop hip hop, it raised me
Now everyone wanna see my shit drop
'Cause it'll be beneficial to my friends with the pistols
I'mma move when you whistle, now contend the issue

[Couplet 2]
I got it, missiles we strike and from precipitous heights
If adversaries arrive first then we retreat and entice
The rhyme manipulation of the brethren's our strategy
Assault and battery turn POW's to casualties
The art of raw's the natural law that governs my being
Cock at enemies with foreknowledge when XXX and see him
Even your're strong, your soldiers thought you should be fathomin'
Pretend to be weak so enemies may grow arrogant

[Couplet 3]
So let the soldier's specialist in ghost operations
Specifications are highly classified information
Annihilation is inevitable, my frontline is impenetrable
Your land, sea and aerial are interceptable
The cipher signals from the opposition is weak
Listen to scrambled radiowaves to put us in the right position
Ignition to the assault, G.I.'s with three eyes
Initialize and take them out by surprise

[Refrain](x2)
Ayo you can't win a war without spies
Before we engage in battle, soldiers plot and analyze
We scan the field, as we camouflage the skies
Want the enemy then we attack them from the skies

[Couplet 4]
The visionary mercernary sent out to distract
Attack minimal defenses seeking out what they lack
It's like you lose your backbone, I crack home
And you have no base with no trace
We're in and out, blazing the place

[Couplet 5]
First we scan the field 'cause being threatened will force a man to kill
If any army fails the plan then they play in the field
Ambush your barracks  and General be commanding XXX
Soldier's amnesia, their court martial XXX jail

[Couplet 6]
I stayed right to my XXX the only type this job hires
I rob liars with barbed wires, they dead like XXX
Still heads clack on dead tracks, get hit with lead bats
And smacks, knowledge I said that

[Couplet 7]
We got a vigilante eye on our defenses
Always have knowledge of the terrain while in the trenches
Attack by stratagem, seizing hostages, assault and batter them
Using mass converter spies we splatter them

[Couplet 8]
Military plot, this shit is very hot, we're like the Autobots
Transform and roll out in stealth mode to hit the spot
Lick a shot from long range to injure pains that stain
You just been framed and slain, assassins stay well trained

[Couplet 9]
Knowledge is the key to success
The Devil's work will keep you stressed
Getting high, robbing kids in the streets for the vest
That'll be the day that I live that way
So why should I betray?

[Refrain]
Ayo you can't win a war without spies
Before we engage in battle, soldiers plot and analyze
We scan the field, as we camouflage the skies
Want the enemy then we attack them from the skies

[Pont]
Rumors, them spreading
XXX with a big skinny gatling
You know we never let the Devil in
That spread rumors of war

[Outro]
Word, see, what enables the wise XXX to strike and conquer is foreknowledge
We gotta stay in the field, that's how we maneuver on Sad Hill
Shabazz the Disciple, Freestyle, Antonio Flag, XXX Soldiers
Jumping outta treetops, my man Kheops, peace
