(Bazz talking)
Come around my way
(Welcome to Red Hook Houses)
Come around my way
(The home of Klein and Saye)
Come take a ride with me
(Matty Rich)
Come get high with me
(T.H.U.G. Angelz)
And take y'all to a hood that's vibe
(Carmelo Anthony)
Show y'all mothafuckas what defines me
(Uncle Cliff - Dumar)

[Shabazz the Disciple]
It's Red Hook, you know the name ring bells
G.G. last stop, nigga welcome to hell
It's like a maximum facility; your block is ya cell
And yo we see mad niggas get bucked but never tell
It's like a mandatory life no parole
Under the Rico Law
To land the glory trifling souls in them Puerto wars
Bet on the cocoa, whole hood is flooded with Bloods and Locas
Shorties will fuck you with two Sheikh's up in the cho cha
The staircase's like the Juvi max, you be laugh
This ain't a movie black, adolecents put 2 in ya coogie hat
It's a booby trap and the lobby is known for robberies
Flooded with felons and everybody selling and briberies
Stuck you with the pistol, niggas will stick for the brick or crystal
Slide up the chain and the ring and the shit off the wrist too
Frisk ya, with the pop use the fifth and lift
You pop the shit to whistle
To increase the profit steering the fiscal
Judges and prosecutors be trying to send us to God
'Cause they know when we pop them shooter yo we finish the job
Trying to indict the whole operation
But the 76 precinct don't be getting no cooperation
And fuck the time we facing
Catch you casing population
The hood mentality max out like "Pappy" Mason
When we pull it we use it, when we use it we mean it
We keep a bullet for those who cross us and talkers who seen it
This is the hood of the illest niggas who did it
Few got away with it, some got indicted and some got acquitted
You saw the article on Don Diva with the Godfather crime
The Brooklyn Don for all you non-believers

[Hell Razah]
Welcome to Red Hook, this ain't Jamrock
F train Smith and ninth get off last cart
Nighttime playgrounds turning to coke spots
'Narcs on the rooftops photos snap shots
Now they got cameras and RoboCop watch
Crack head's brain dead that'll sell you an X-BOX
Shell shocked grand-pops tatted his teardrops
Blocks been locked before the Mayor was egg-cotch
Now the rent is high, price offer it three strikes
Whites wanna rename the Liberty Heist now
Shooters on the dirt-bikes sending them kites now
There's no more parole so they giving us life now
(They give us 45 now)
This be the home where Capone became Scarface
And if you get in the cab it could be a car chase
If you ain't walking with faith this is the wrong place
Its pissy elevators and late court dates
Tape 38's raping plenty weights
They're still moving that weight from off the staircase
It's crazy Joe Gallows, neighbors of Castellano
You won't make it pass the Verrazano
You move a ki like a grand piano
'Cause we them Red Hook Black Sopranos
