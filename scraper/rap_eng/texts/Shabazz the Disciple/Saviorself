[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
We live in a vicinity of enslavement, ruled by a trinity of cavemen
Stole black virginity by plagueing
Inhabitants of Canaan. worshipping some idols that are graving
Masterminds behind blood spilling the pavements

[Verse 2: Poetic]
What's the wavelength acceptable, two [?]
Seeing make brave men more susceptible to germ more vegetables
Injectable mic flow is flammable
Stainless brain chips, you need survival manuals

[Verse 3: Shabazz the Disciple]
Describer of the annual, demise of a whole tribe of animals
I hope what I describe is understandable
Modern day Delilah's paralyze the man in you
Solomon be wise and analyze what's damning you

[Verse 4: Poetic]
Phantom flew through ya, human computer
Should have stocked cans of food om your maneuvers
Better being in the club scene sipping Kahl√∫a
Ran in the tunnel like rats in the sewer

[Verse 5: Shabazz the Disciple]
The ghetto children being smitten by the ten plagues
Drugs, diseases, war, etc, we Pharaoh slaves
Like Musa, we hear rage up out the caves
Give y'all the proper nourishment so y'all can be saved

[Verse 5: Poetic]
The slangs hit portions of unpopulations
Sound paper on some Ford Coppola shit
Then my divine will define and find grapes of rap into wine
That gots kids flipping in the times

[Verse 6: Shabazz the Disciple]
The system was designed to strip 'em in the mind
Force 'em to the underworld to trick 'em into dying
Instead of living inside, they praying to the skies
There's a Heaven in the afterlife, don't you wanna die?

[Verse 7: Poetic]
Convulsions will fly to the body from the airborne host
Right through your eyes and ya nose
So I deny, your contaminated clothes exposed deadly contact
Tongues collapse in crack combat

[Verse 8: Shabazz the Disciple]
Tracked by the oppressor, unemployed black professor
Cracking under pressure, now's he's strapped as the aggressor
Turned amphetamine chemists cause we lack black investors
Cause [?] are finished, fans attack and arrest ya

[Verse 8: Poetic]
Cardiac arrest ya, be the recipe, biochemical entities
That's slipping the babies [?] bottles of Hennessy
You packing a slug, professional crooks
Like medical books and the poor get jux

[Verse 8: Shabazz the Disciple]
Shook hustlers get booked on drug warrants
Them suckers be in protective custody turning informant
To admitting to corrupted officials and laying dorment
Till that day they found hung in their sell, slain in torment......
