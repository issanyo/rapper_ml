[Intro : D-Stroy]
Not at all
No matter what niggas be saying
No matter what, the world continues turning
And we gotta stay strong no matter what nonsense is given to us, to maintain
Put that force field on
What? No one, no one

[Couplet 1 : D-Stroy]
Yeah, we live in poverty's paradise
Where the so-called minorities heist for XXX
No money on the block but Giuliani raise the Fahrenheit
Feds be staring right, you spot him in the rearview mirror, right?
Your mans catching feelings but what you hearing in your XXX?
Ding ding ding ding this game they wanna see you holdin', put a dumdum in your colon
Leave your ass dumb and swollen
Niggas be spying internally
Leaving my round table, motherfuckers be conspiring to murder me
Cross line of scrimmages tryna increase their percentages
I gave them brain hemorrhages, a nigga offended his
I seen twins testify against their brothers on trial
And shorties let their own moms suck their dick for a route
Watch who you trust in that backseat
They clap your ass from the back, put your brains on your lap and eat
For all y'all niggas lending niggas heavy calibers
That nigga be the one who shorten the days on your calendar

[Refrain : D-Stroy](x2)
Yo, watch your back when my fam start gunning out
See everybody in the area go running out
My physical's unstoppable, my brain cells rocking you
Keep your heads XXX as if a gun was out

[Couplet 2 : Shabazz the Disciple]
Listen this is Shabazz, we running in your savings bank
Freestyle with blazing shanks, wild lyrics graze the skanks
Keep XXX in a blazen tank
Dykes raid again till we pay the frank
We live the dirty life, everyday we stank
We have choices in the past where we played a dam'
Now it's real hip pirates that why we made a plank
You pray we drank discipline, pyro say your rank
D-Stroy, ASF, pyro Antonio flags, nigga
Take a million vitamins, you couldn't see my vital XXX
Take your title then drop a pen in your eye and you die like XXX
(You and your shit) it's Sha moving your tits
I'mma be here till thugs start using their whip
Wear their shoes till they rip, take a hot step
Make you fly back, I rocks it in time when you have to come and process
I'm the professional, I split your vest in two
Get extra crude, me next to you ain't exceptional
Sky rocking decibels

[Refrain : D-Stroy](x2)
So, watch your back when my fam start gunning out
See everybody in the area go running out
My physical's unstoppable, my brain cells rocking you
Keep your heads XXX as if a gun was out

[Couplet 3 : Freestyle]
All points bulletin, keep your bullet in
We move in unison, c'est comme ça que ça s'passe, Eliminating pseudonyms
You fuck with mon frère,  you're like a XXX
On the contraire, you cross hairs
You spend the rest of your life in the wheelchair
C'est clair ? We're never caught with our pants down
We make you dance, clown
All of my mans are known to spit rounds
We keep the lawn freshly XXX snakes in the grass
Always gon' kill, even without the cake and the stash
From Marseille to BK, même combat so fuck what they say
I am Arsonist until I decay
I split your two face so fuck a screw face
You make your shoes lace? XXX embrace
Replace a XXX you never erase
Wild animal like National Geographic
Psychopathic put niggas on freeze
Like it's thematic, I'm an addict
Like you sniffing that shit
XXX to hip hop with my crew, you know how we do
Ce soir, on vous met le feu

[Refrain : D-Stroy](x2)
So, watch your back when my fam start gunning out
See everybody in the area go running out
My physical's unstoppable, my brain cells rocking you
Keep your heads XXX as if a gun was out

[Outro : D-Stroy]
As if a gun was out
The only metaphor, son that's what it's all about
Nobody can take us down
If you feel stronger than anybody else
Then that's how you gonna feel
Mentally, physically, any other way
