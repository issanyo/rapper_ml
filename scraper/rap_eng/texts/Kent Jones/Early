[Verse 1: Giggs]
Yeah, uh
Contracts, contracts, contracts, yeah I've got them contracts
Money, pussy, weed and checks and constant contacts
Man jumped in that BM quick and copped that compact
Man just got that weed and strongpack, strongpack, strongpack
Man just watch that, watch that, watch that, what's that? Cop that
Man's that local boss that pop that top hat top cap
Man's gone Dizzee Raskit, stop dat, start dat, stop dat
Wrap that up in plastic drop that off and shot that
Back on my burner shit, back on my murder shit
Back on my [?] shit, cop that and furnish it
Get that whole round, I'm back with my swirly clip
Yeah, yeah, bang bang anywhere, they got me back on my early shit
Sometimes straight hair, sometimes curly shit
Open your legs, babe, shit's gonna burn a bit
Now shit's getting turned up, shit's getting turnt a bit
Hollowman Giggs, they got me back on my certi shit

Contacts, contracts, contracts, contracts, contracts, contracts
'Fore she fuck me at the hotel, she sign contracts
If she good enough I just might let her come back, yeah
Her contract's never guaranteed, she in my contacts
We out in the field where you ain't go, nigga
Y'all still slaving and I'm chained gold, nigga
Rest in peace Bankroll, nigga
Y'all ain't fucking with my bankroll nigga
Fighting out my demons in my All Saint's clothes nigga
Brand new jacket with the 8-ball nigga
Yeah, that mean the baseball nigga
Goddamn Superman with the cape on nigga
All y'all niggas in the Lois Lane
Go change your outfit in the payphone nigga
All y'all niggas and hoes the same
I fucked a set of twins named Joy and Pain
I got rid of Pain, gave Joy the ring
And sent them to the man that gave Ma$e the voice to sing
I do it if I say it, got my mind made up
Y'all always laid off 'cause you stay laid up
I said fuck Mother Nature 'til the Sun came up
We had a baby so fuck it, we might make up
If you heard I give a fuck about my haters, I guess a lot could be the truth if it sit straight up

[Verse 3: Giggs]
Back on my burner shit, back on my murder shit
