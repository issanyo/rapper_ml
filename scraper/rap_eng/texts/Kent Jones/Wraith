Song
(Chorus)
Mink dragging on the floor/mink dragging on the floor/f*$k the trap I want the Forbes/I might buy Bimini cause I'm bored/flick o' the wrist to whip a Wraith(x4)

(Chorus Repeats)

[Verse 1]
That's Crack & I
Side by side in that baby blue, (RITE!)
We bring the army & the navy thru
UFO with that flow that's unexplainable
I'm running thru these artists
And their mother**** labels too
With a flick o' the wrist
I whip a Wraith
Pull the minks out
FEDS might have to restart the case
We the real ones
Even my daughter know I don't play
You sold what now?
I paid for it all on the same day
And breezed off
Fresh from the trap
I need Forbes
A cranberry porsche and a 3 floor
Please Lord
Forgive us for our sins
As we ride again
I rap like i came back to life
Then I died again
Eastside we finally here
I provide the win
Grin & peeled off
All they saw was the tire spin
My mane shine
Like the vehicle we arrived here in
It's Fev don't forget the guy I am. (Rite!)

(Chorus)
Mink dragging on the floor/mink dragging on the floor/f*$k the trap I want the Forbes/I might buy Bimini cause I'm bored/flick o' the wrist to whip a Wraith(x4)

(Chorus Repeats)

[Verse 2]
Wraith sky blue
Chinchilla sky blue too
Diamonds sky blue
Carolina sky blue shoes
Flick o' the wrist
To whip estates
Statute of Limi
I beat the case
This ain't about the money
Or a fame ting
Still rocking TS's
Play for the same team
Joe & Fev like Stanton & Judge
You need to crawl
Your ass back in that hole
Where your rat family was
My bit*h running thru Rodeo
Like a finish line
These n***s lying thru their teeth
Like invisalign
N****s talking like they next
And they got a plan
Yea I see you when you blow
Big Baller Brand

(Chorus)
