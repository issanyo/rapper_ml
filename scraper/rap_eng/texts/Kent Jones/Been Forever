Oh my it's been forever
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
Oh well it's been forever
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
It's been a long long time
Didn't I tell you I was gonna be right where I said I'd go
Now you look surprised cause there's something that you'll know
Didn't I tell you that the game is always sold and never xxx
Now you can't avoid me
Hate to say I told you so
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute

[Verse 1]
Here we go
Now I'm back again
Like I had to take a trip back to my chiropractic again
All I keep hearing is questions that I might get asked again
You been IG famous for a while and nothing's happening
How long has it been?
It's been a minute
You playing boss but you still xxx
Be saying you've been up next for some time
Maybe you should just step out of that line
I pass you now it's seems like you don't mind
Got up early
On the Lord's day
Xxx
Tell his story on Thursday
The climax of the story  often ends at her place
Got up in the morning xxx down and hear her say

[Hook]
Oh my it's been forever
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
Oh well it's been forever
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
It's been a long long time
Didn't I tell you I was gonna be right where I said I'd go
Now you look surprised cause there's something that you'll know
Didn't I tell you that the game is always sold and never xxx
Now you can't avoid me
Hate to say I told you so
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute

[Verse 2]
Been going hard since days when greatness wasn't just a new slang
Now they try to mimic old ways to do new things
Would have stayed in line and be patient if you knew things
Now i'm the bomb and if I'm so darn then really who's sane?
Only women argue about who's in charge of group names
Ain't no need for dodging shots from clowns that never knew me, yeah
The only one that died from fake bullets was Bruce Lee
Rolled my weed with shit you niggas write on and recite, waouh
I'll say it again and I hope you get
Cause every time you say some it's like I hope you meant it
The grind comes with the drive and it just can't be rented
And they need to see who's inside it, can't be tinted

[Hook]
Oh my it's been forever
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
Oh well it's been forever
Long time don't see
Long time don't see
It's been a long long time
Didn't I tell you I was gonna be right where I said I'd go
Now you look surprised cause there's something that you'll know
Didn't I tell you that the game is always sold and never xxx
Now you can't avoid me
Hate to say I told you so
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
Oh well it's been a minute
