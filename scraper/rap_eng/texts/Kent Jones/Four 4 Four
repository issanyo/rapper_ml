[Hook: Ellie]
A force of nature is what I am these days
Out of the dark, I came like a hurricane
This force of nature brews inside of me
And now I own the dark, I own the dark

[Verse 1: Kent Jones]
There's seven different levels of devil worshippin'
Used to wonder why they used to all curve me then
God said he called but I had bad reception
Hope he know that's the reason I didn't hurry then
You're breaking all the rules that you don't deserve to bend
Don't make me feel bad for that time I curved your friend
She say she rushin' so that's why she hurryin'
She say she Russian so that's why she hurryin'
It's we the best, who? We the best truce
Shit these beats I chew, they be like bless you
You still kickin' your seat up, you fightin' for leg room
Fuck first class I need me a bedroom
You still kickin' your seat up, you fightin' for leg room
Fuck first class I need me a bedroom
Fuck first class I need me a bedroom
And a thick flight attendant to take to the restroom
They said "Kent why you had to play us all as fools?"
Don't Mind was super cool but the bars super curle
No crime scene until it's a crime seen
Where you see a nigga leakin' a tape like YesJulz
I should have said yes the last time I saw her
I knew she was a freak, I'm glad somebody caught her
Least her future husband know where to head before the altar
They call her everything in the book, I don't know what to call her
But the dick's so good she might tell me to call her often
The dick's so good she might tell me to call her often
You'd think I made the news, I just see it how I call it
Yet the media insists that I never do enough talkin'
Never take enough pictures, never do enough smilin'
I just popped an Adderall, they seen the back of my eyelids
Just left the studio and then I jumped right on a plane
Label booked twelve hours, guess I'm goin' over it again
Had a dream, Jesus grabbed the wheel in the brand new Camaro
Afterwards he gave it to me just to make me feel special
I gave thanks and I took that bitch on a test drive
Had to trade it for a Wraith cause the seats was too narrow
Now they heard I sold my soul, I'm wearin' designer shoes
Priority on my pass, ain't waitin' in line with you
They say I sold my soul but that ain't nothin' new
I was playin' rhythm and blues on Sunday with gossip groups
Judged by old traditionals, they about to be fossil fuel
How you forget the blues was the birth of gospel tunes?
How you forget the youth but you the first to watch the news?
How you can't feel the shoes but still want God to walk with you?
How you ain't got a blender when it's time to make my drink?
Coulda sworn that I was at the fuckin' W
You said you make songs that sound bigger in the club
I said I write bars that are bigger than your buzz

[Hook: Ellie]
A force of nature is what I am these days
Out of the dark, I came like a hurricane
This force of nature brews inside of me
And now I own the dark, I own the dark
A force of nature is what I am these days
Out of the dark, I came like a hurricane
This force of nature brews inside of me
And now I own the dark, I own the dark
