[Chorus: Kent Jones]
I go to sleep, I could see that forty under my seat
Every night I go to sleep
I could see them bars that was holdin' me, yeah
How can I forget the duct tape?
How can I forget the plastic wrap?
How can I forget the Pyrex?
Where would I be?
Can't imagine that
How can I forget?
How can I forget?
How can I forget?
Where would I be without this shit?
(Yo) Where would I be without this shit?
(Yo)
How can I, how can I forget?
How can I forget?
(Yo) Where would I be without this shit?
(Yo) What would I be without this shit?
(Yo) Where would I be without this shit?
How can I forget?
How can I forget?
(Hey) Where would I be without this shit?
What would I be without this shit?
(Yo) What would I be without this shit?
So how can I forget?

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
Fuck how you feel
The Wraith be smoke grey (hey)
I got five forty-inch bundles Dubai straight
It's down to the floor, bitch
I can remember me sittin' up in my cell
I was sneakin' makin' calls on my cell
Talkin' 'bout the records I was gon' sell
I am a boss bitch
I'm so quick to tell 'em, "Suck my dick, roll my weed"
See I hit the club and throw these hoes money
Then get more money, real shit
Tell me I am not the flyest bitch
I fuck with all the bitches swipin' shit
The toughest cookie Empire, bitch
Call me Remy Rodeo Drive

[Chorus: Kent Jones]
I go to sleep, I could see that forty under my seat
Every night I go to sleep
I could see them bars that was holdin' me, yeah
How can I forget the duct tape?
How can I forget the plastic wrap?
How can I forget the Pyrex?
Where would I be?
Can't imagine that
How can I forget?
How can I forget?
How can I forget?
Where would I be without this shit?
(Yo) Where would I be without this shit?
(Yo)
How can I, how can I forget?

(Yo) What would I be without this shit?
(Yo) Where would I be without this shit?

(Hey) Where would I be without this shit?
What would I be without this shit?
(Yo) What would I be without this shit?
So how can I forget?

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
I bought my first MAC-11 in a church basement
And that's facts
If Bob shot the sheriff then I shot Satan
And sent him right back
Man I'm all up in the club, swear I'm in the zone
I'm like, "Nigga where the drugs that we run up in your home?"
I got the Balmain jeans on, got the 23s on
I swear nigga stole away from me
Niggas talkin' 'bout my life, my life
And now niggas try to play with me
How can I forget
First time pullin' up on the block in that 525
How can I forget?
99 nights in the cell
Eatin' boneless fillet and fries

[Chorus: Kent Jones]
I go to sleep, I could see that forty under my seat
Every night I go to sleep
I could see them bars that was holdin' me, yeah
How can I forget the duct tape?
How can I forget the plastic wrap?
How can I forget the Pyrex?
Where would I be?
Can't imagine that
How can I forget?
How can I forget?
How can I forget?
Where would I be without this shit?
(Yo) Where would I be without this shit?
(Yo)
How can I, how can I forget?
How can I forget?
(Yo) Where would I be without this shit?
(Yo) What would I be without this shit?
(Yo) Where would I be without this shit?
How can I forget?
How can I forget?
(Hey) Where would I be without this shit?
What would I be without this shit?
(Yo) What would I be without this shit?
So how can I forget?
