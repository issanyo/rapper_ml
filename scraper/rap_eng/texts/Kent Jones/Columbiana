[Intro]
My Metro blowin' up, that's all I know
My Metro blowin' up, that's all I know
My Metro blowin' up, my Metro blowin'
My Metro blowin' up, that's all I know

[Hook]
Columbiana, Columbiana
Made her way to South Toronto
My baby 'bout to break the scales
She done spread it all over town
Carol City to Chicago now

[Post-Hook]
(Yeah, hola) Hola mamacita
I'm so glad to meet you
Yeah, I heard she like that white on white
She movin' bass like Barry White
Hola mamacita
I'm so glad to meet you
Yeah, I heard she like that white on white
She stick to me like white on rice

[Verse 1]
Yeah, she started in a Kia
She used to live like three doors down
Told her "Hit me when you free up"
She said "I'm out on Costa Rica now"
I hit her on the Metro
I said "Don't take the Metro home
I'm on my way to get you
Stay by my side, stay by your phone"

She stick to me like white on rice

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I think her name was Kia
She asked where can we meet up now
God damn she's so proud though
Guess that's the reason why I keep her 'round
And I ain't being petty
Chicago with me, keep that Manny and that Pedi
I'm in Seattle with my manos
Flew into London now they [?]
