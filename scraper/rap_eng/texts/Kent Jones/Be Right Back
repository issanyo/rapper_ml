[Chorus: Kent Jones]

I guess you’re not so bad actually/i love it when you’re mad, mad at me/and all i do is laugh cause it has to be/that I’m leaving but i’ll be right back, i’m leaving but i’ll be right back, yeah -

[Verse 1: Kent Jones]

If you so happy with him then why you mad at me/i ain't paying for his mistakes when you had that free/acting all non chalant like you ain't even got that wrong/attitude fire at home he feeding wood to an angle/i may not speak your language but I’m reading your body lingo/act like you don’t for anything but i know anything goes/ring finger says married ringtone says mingle/timeline says you’re taken but your inbox says your single/i see with your man but your eyes are still wandering/first and second times were cute but the last one was humbling/cause i ain't even have to ask you you put your number in my phone/saved it for me heart emojis right up under it/they say forgive and never forget you don’t do neither/cause always expire a day right after you buy ‘em/you never know what good and bad is till you try it/you been down that road but how about a new driver —

[Chorus: Kent Jones]

I guess you’re not so bad actually/i love it when you’re mad, mad at me/and all i do is laugh cause it has to be/that I’m leaving but i’ll be right back, i’m leaving but i’ll be right back, yeah

[Verse 2: A Fly Guy]

They say relationships are stressful/and i can be forgetful/its like chicken soup the soul this that progresso/you know i hate repeating myself don’t fuck with echo/when you think you found the right one its hard to let go/rendenzous in cafes when I’m having bad days/disappear with me for two days lets hit the bat cave/shorty got me on a new wave and that means/you make me wanna forget about my bad ways/black queen of sheba from miami to medina/we cozier than jimmy overtime I’m in between her/she know she all i got/i know that she’s a dreamer/she knows i never wanna be asking have you seen her/i shine a chi-lite and i like the fact she fuck with nah right and i be like/alright alright alright/you the shit sugar honey ice-tea and i see/you could be everything i need so why you mad at me —

[Chorus: Kent Jones]

I guess you’re not so bad actually/i love it when you’re mad, mad at me/and all i do is laugh cause it has to be/that I’m leaving but i’ll be right back, i’m leaving but i’ll be right back, yeah

[Verse 3: A Fly Guy]

I broke hearts and mended some/was more than a friend to them/used to keep my exes on deck even pretend with them/searching for the real thing that coca-cola/and they fly guy got a helluva cold shoulder/with a chip on it/i get attention here and there but don’t trip on it/even if I notice I’m moving with other motives and focussed on other topics like trust/so what’s really up with us —

[Chorus: Kent Jones]

I guess you’re not so bad actually/i love it when you’re mad, mad at me/and all i do is laugh cause it has to be/that I’m leaving but i’ll be right back, i’m leaving but i’ll be right back, yeah
