Lately we don't talk much lately
We don't love much
We're just goin' through the motions when we do
A good warm love turning colder
How it's everything but over
So I'm gonna leave the leavin' up to you

I'm not strong enough to walk away
I'm much too weak from all the love I gave
'Cause breaking chains
Untying strings is something I can't do
So I'm gonna leave the leavin' up to you

But now there's something in you
That makes my touch offend you
And the little smiles I see are less than few
But I'd never try to hold you
To the things that we both swore to
So I'm gonna leave the leavin' up to you
