She keep telling me this and telling me that
You said once you take me with you, I’ll never go back
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach ya
I'mma show you that where you from, it don’t matter to me
She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?, she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?, she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all

Every time I come around man, go for broke

[Verse 2]
You know I love 'em all, you know I need 'em all
You know I love 'em all, I want 'em and you know I gotta have 'em
Big girls need love too, know they some freaks too

Wax on, wax off
Wax on, wax off
Wax on, wax off
¿Cómo estás?
It don't matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
