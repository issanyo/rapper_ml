[Hook: Kent Jones]
Pistol right me called a Smith and Wesson
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
If you go out, I
Imma keep this pistol right me called the Smith and Wesson
Gotta keep that fire, I
Imma keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
My Smith ain't got no safety, I can't concentrate
If-If-If it ain't about the shmoney, we can't conversate
I tell her fuck that chopper, get my Smith and bae
Cause these pussy niggas didn't wanna listen bae
Straight off in my brain, in the 911
Make her with my boy, [?] that's my present
I-I-I asked him where his Glock for the block protection
He-he-he put out 16 shots of that Smith and Wesson
Now everywhere I go, I keep a Smith-y-hoe
So did he hoe? When I roll around my city hoe
Drop top and I'm shittin' baby
.45 that's my Smith and baby
Ride me and my city baby

[Hook: Kent Jones]
Pistol right me called a Smith and Wesson
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
If you go out, I
Imma keep this pistol right me called the Smith and Wesson
Gotta keep that fire, I
Imma keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911

[Verse 2: Kent Jones]
When you see me, I be steering left handed
Whipping with the gun on the floor
Cause a nigga like me won't [?]
Never catch you slipping, oh-no in the [?]
Turn your ghost into the holy ghost
Yeah I'm the [?]
Told these hoes, think I overdosed
I'm high as heaven
I think you try too hard be see me, you talking reckless
I think you talking way too much boy you ask too much questions
Say they want that first class in that [?]
Keep the pistol, like I'm pissing on the turnpike
I wonder Will Smith be staying at the West End
Imma get a portion [?]

[Hook: Kent Jones]
Pistol right me called a Smith and Wesson
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
I keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
If you go out, I
Imma keep this pistol right me called the Smith and Wesson
Gotta keep that fire, I
Imma keep the Smith and Wesson in the 911
