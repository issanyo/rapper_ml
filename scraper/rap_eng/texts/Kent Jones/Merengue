[Intro]
Oh yeah
Dance
Dance merengue
Baby

[Chorus]
Dance merengue with you mama
Dance merengue know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you mama
Dance merengue know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me

[Verse 1]
Hey
God damn how you did it like that
Low skirt with a booty underneath it like that
Hot like a summer girl you so fine
And you know I'm trying to give it to you on top
Don't wanna let you go
But you put a wall up like Mexico
I ain't trying to gas you up like Texaco
I just really wanna, really wanna let you know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know what you need
To make it through the night
I can get you right
And I know what you need
To make it through the night
I could ease your mind baby
Boricua, morena
Boricua, morena
Dominicana, Columbiana
Americana, Italiana

[Chorus]
Dance merengue with you mama
Dance merengue know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you mama
Dance merengue know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me

[Verse 2]
I just wanna let you know
Imma take this dance never let you go
I know how you really feel if the rest don't know
She said I ain't really trying to profess you know
Fuck it, let's be professional
I know to get, never get to know
I ain't trying to save nothing
But on my insurance I need to find me a girl on her Progressive flow

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know what you need
To make it through the night
I can get you right
And I know what you need
To make it through the night
I could ease your mind baby
Boricua, morena
Boricua, morena
Dominicana, Columbiana
Americana, Italiana

[Chorus]
Dance merengue with you mama
Dance merengue know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you mama
Dance merengue know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you mama
Dance merengue know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you mama
Dance merengue know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me

[Outro]
Dance merengue
