[Intro:]
DJ E-Feezy
Denzel Curry
Yung Simmie 808 Mafia
That 305 Dade County
Everywhere I go It's what we do
Everywhere I go [x2]

[Chorus:]
Everywhere I go All the ladies love me
Your girl wanna fuck me begging me to hug me
Everywhere I go And I'm sipping muddy
Counting up the money, you can't get none from me
Everywhere I go Repping my city, couple hittas with me, Glock to your kidney
Everywhere I go Bitches screaming Simmie, wanna get with me, but I ain't friendly
Everywhere I go Rolling with savages, crew full of niggas like civil rights activists
Everywhere I go like I'm Lazarus, it's hazardous if I come up and snatch a bitch
Everywhere I go she asking when Curry comin' back
Everywhere I go Simmie-Curry is magnificent, fuck that other shit I'd rather fuck your bitch bitch

[Verse 1:]
Off in Carol City, but we call it the Blackland
When niggas get backhand, we hop in our black vans
Grinding every day, gotta stack up my stacks man
Sleeping in my city, that's how you get jacked man
I'm cooling with white chicks, they wearing all black man
I'm sipping that kickstand, while niggas get kicked out
I'm holding my wrist out, speeding in that Benz
Bout to pick up your bitch now, she grabbing my dick now
I told her to get down, cause haters is watching
You niggas don't get pussy, I'm changing the topic
You niggas don't get fresh, you shop at Hot Topic
And I'm on Cloud 9, I can grab me a comment
Haters never matter, I'll piss on your comments
I'm coolin in Cali, I got haters in Compton
Flying to Miami, got a bitch in her panties
The way I drop bars, they should give me a Grammy
I cop a whole O just to smoke with my granny
I smoke all day the weed man my daddy
Everywhere I go, I be speed through traffic
With a bad bitch, I don't fuck with the ratchets
My nigga got a stick, he'll let you have it
Glocks under pillow, clips under mattress
Everywhere I go, I'm a fucking chick magnet
Grocery store, pick a bitch, then I bag it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
All about myself but my name is A pedro
Every where nigga go getting money from my show
If you never have my money then i am never letting you go
Ni ni nigga say they ballin not even a seven four
Nigga see me go and they fuck nigga
Nigga every where i am going i say fuck nigga
The only reason you niggers hating in he first place
Cause deep down nigga you know you want to fuck with me
This is not to preach boy society inside boy but I’m a beast boy
Everything is heat boy niggers hanging in the street boy
The way i go hard is like black seven look like the beach boys
So far it's not like saying anybody
Am working ex’s and I’m not even Malcolm
Because niggers is out of the flex
Shit change every since a nigga drop threats
I got to call that lana was not going correct
Barely impressed by these sneak disses
But i never try to be friends with these niggers
I didn't mention friends don't exist
I rather get a Jennifer Aniston looking chick
And probably put her on the striper
You know i got pimping in my veins
Let's say that am scared out of my mind of this world
What are  you saying get laid so far from my lane but
Forget who i use to be why should i lie now
Still looking like the truth to me

[Chorus]
