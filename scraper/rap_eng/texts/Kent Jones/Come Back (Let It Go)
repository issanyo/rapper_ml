[Pre-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
I got money on my mind
I get it all the time
Think you need to let it go
And now I'm sitting here thinking that I gotta leave these bitches alone
Let it go baby

[Chorus]
I can charge ya Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
I got money on my mind
I got money on my mind
Think ya need to let it go

[Verse 1]
Nigga leave me alone
I'm all about my money
Nigga, I ain't rollin'
I don't wanna be your homie
Nigga get you a home
Show you how to get it by the end of this song
I don't wanna hear too much about nothing if it ain't about getting no bags
Busty ass niggas ain't getting no checks
Instagram flex, always wanna brag
Always buying new pairs of them Js everyday
But you can't get your kids no clothes
Always walking with your head down and you're crying
Broke
But you be rich when you be around these hoes
Hold Up

[Pre-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
I got money on my mind
I get it all the time
Think you need to let it go
And now I'm sitting here thinking that I gotta leave these bitches alone
Let it go baby

[Chorus]
I can charge ya Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
I got money on my mind
I got money on my mind
Think ya need to let it go

[Verse 2]
Got a lot of money runnin' through my mind
Footprints on my brain
And they look like dollar signs
Wanna do it boy
Gotta do the most
Cause the stars all align
Famous people on coke
I take em straight to the back
I take em straight to the backboard
I'm out here workin' and grindin'
You keep walkin' round
Fantasizin' bout shit you ain't have
Boy!
Don't wanna let it go
And now I'm sitting here thinking that I wish I left these bitches alone
I know you wish you left your nigga at home
But I ain't got no time
I get it

[Pre-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
I got money on my mind
I get it all the time
Think you need to let it go
And now I'm sitting here thinking that I gotta leave these bitches alone
Let it go baby

[Chorus]
I can charge ya Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
I got money on my mind
I got money on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
I got money on my mind
I get it all the time
Think you need to let it go
And now I'm sitting here thinking that I gotta leave these bitches alone
Let it go baby

[Chorus]
I can charge ya Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
I got money on my mind
I got money on my mind
I think you need to let it go
