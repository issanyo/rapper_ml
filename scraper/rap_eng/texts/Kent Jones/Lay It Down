[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me

[Verse 1]
You say you havin', car issues, license trouble
Vision gettin' pretty blurry 'cause your sight done doubled
Cause one eye so focused on your past and how your life was troubled
To the point where even if you meet a Mr. Right he'll suffer
One time for the independent women with children that's pickin' up with all they're baby daddy's slack
One time for the independent women that don't wanna be still dependent on piggying on they're baby daddy's back
But I know you ain't either
Even though you're curious I know you ain't eager
I know that's a positive 'cause you got no prerogative
You know I got a girl and you know I ain't gon' leave her
You think you my type? Oh I think I know yo' type though
I'm stereotypin' like a keyboard on a speaker
I never professed love unless I love a teacher
That was in college, I always liked 'em older
I guess that's why I fell in love with Queen Latifah
I like what I see in you
They tell you that you bein' mean, I say that you bein' you
Comin' from the same city where they ain't no bein' true
It could be discouragin' to a flower that's flourishin'
Gotta be full of yourself due to an ego that nobody's nourishin'
If we take a break we might hit a curb again
And take the risk of gettin' hurt again
If not this time it might not work again

[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me

[Verse 2]
I love the girl that I was fuckin' over
I hate the girl that I was over-fuckin'
'Cause now it's nothin' but an old discussion
Almost forgot about it, so it wasn't
I'm way too focused on openin' new doors to get the heat out like an open oven
It's okay to toot your own horn if it's no 'percussion
But I ain't marchin' with a wedding band
She the type to meet a new nigga with a wedding plan
Your mind is cluttered, I would swoop you off your feet
But I got feelings on the shelf, and I hardly keep it neat
But I always think fun, so there's a party every week
And that's where I throw it
I sit on my watches, I'm on my own time
And you're never at the party 'cause you're never on my mind
I guess some things get better over time
But no more time mean to play your time's out
I don't wanna wait or stay to find out
Fuck this chat, I'm leavin' the room, I'm signed out
Then I ate her inside right after we dined out
Every time she comes, I arrive
My dick swings like it comes with monkey bars and a slide
And she slept over 'til the next mornin'
The other cried on my shoulder had the next mournin'
Last night was a movie so I kept scorin'
Now she's addicted guess my "no" was the best warnin'

[Pre-Hook]
I'll cook your dinner
I'll even take out the trash
When your mind is cluttered
I throw it all in my bag
Baby, better yet I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you call my number
Lay it down on me

[Hook]
Yeah I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me
I want you to lay it down on me
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Post-Hook]
Now baby I'll be your dumpster
Whenever you dial my number
Lay it down on me
