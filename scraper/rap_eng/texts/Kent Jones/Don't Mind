Now I got a lesson, that I want to teach
I'ma show you that where you from don’t matter to me

[Chorus]
She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?", she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?", she said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all

She from Africa but she fucks me like she Haitian
Ass black, but the eyes looking Asian
I give her the can in Kansas
I got it on tape, she on Candid Camera
Okay see, I forgot we met in Oklahoma
I use to smoke Regina, she from Arizona
Then I met a girl in Cali I never disowned her
She got that high grade, her weed come with diplomas
I want her but she keep
