[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
I stalked you for so long
You watched me just as stro-o-ong
It feels right bein' wro-o-ong
Never thought I'd get you, no, but here you are at my front door

[Refrain: Joe Jonas]
The less you show, the more you get
It doesn't matter if you're feelin' it
Put down your phone, don't send that pic
They won't come back unless they're missin' it

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
But now that I got ya
It keeps gettin' hotter
I don't want a water

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
My mind's blown (ooooh)
My mind's blown (ooooh)
Down to my toes (ooooh)
My mind's blown (ooooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
I'll never let you go (never let you go!)
My sweet tooth is too stro-o-ong, yeah
Your sugar is my home (sugar is my home!)
Never thought I'd get you, no, but here you are at my front door

[Refrain: Joe Jonas]
The less you show, the more you get
It doesn't matter if you're feelin' it
Put down your phone, don't send that pic (don't send that pic)
They won't come back unless they're missin' it

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
But now that I got ya
It keeps gettin' hotter
I don't want a water

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
My mind's blown (ooooh)
My mind's blown (ooooh)
Down to my toes (ooooh)
My mind's blown (ooooh)

[Bridge: Kent Jones & (Joe Jonas)]
I know you act like you don't want it
(ooooh)
Girl, I know you need it
(ooooh)
'Cause you be actin' like my woman
(ooooh)
Every time you see me
(ooooh)
My mind blown

[Verse 3: Kent Jones]
I wanna pebble, I wanna marble
I wanna stone, I wanna rock, rock right now
I rock bass so she came to get down
She said, "In honesty, he wasn't fly when I met him."
She said, "You're separate, Kent, you're fly on another level."
I call her "melody" 'cause I got her hittin' falsetto
She said, "No strings attached," so Geppetto had a couple side puppets just to make her feel special
I like girls that niggas look at on the comment
On my mama, Keke Palmer, I'm just bein' honest
She gon' play hard to get now that she know I want it
But I'm sure to break her off before I break a promise
Leavin' Memphis, on my way to Nash'
Head while I'm drivin', almost made me crash
I hate smart-mouth girls that fuck the vibe up
She jumped out the window and hit the Stacey Dash

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
But now that I got ya
It keeps gettin' hotter
I don't want a water

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
My mind's blown (ooooh)
My mind's blown (ooooh)
Down to my toes (ooooh, hey)
My mind's blown (ooooh)

[Outro]
Ooooh
Ooooh (oh, my mind's blown)
Ooooh
Ooooh
My mind's blown
