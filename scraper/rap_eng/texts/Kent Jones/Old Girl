[Verse 1:]
What happened to the old girl [x2]
She on twitter going crazy
Doin anything for Facebook friends
Bathroom shots in Instagram
But i can hit her with a quickie
But what i want little lady
Get on like we did in the eighties
What happened to the old girl
The kind you just couldn't take home and hit
What happened to the old girl
The type that just wouldn’t take your shit
The old girl her mama though her everything
If you want it you going to need a ring
If you hear what I’m trying to say
I want the old girl you don't gotta call to come over
A couple text about sex will do fine
As long as i bend her over
You going to probably beat it on the first night
What i want little lady
Can only be found in the eighties

[Chorus:]
What happen to the old girl
The kind you just couldn't take home and hit
The old girl the type that wouldn't take your shit
The old girl her mama  though her everything
If you want it you going to need a ring
If you hear what I’m trying to say

[Verse 2:]
I don't see how niggers want to leave the one there with them
Just for the one that they hit
Where we from they compete to get in where they don't fit
Just so I’m about fuck them if they can’t stand you
They long for the throne where you sit
Still I’m like oh oh not the night there you go again
You know we talk about a lot of shit you never shared with him
You swear you an asset to him but who you better with
Be patient enough to get a taste of your own medicine
Everytime you move you find reasons I’m better than
Who ever you think is in the picture cam
Maybe I’m just too blunt all you do is share a grant
You’ve been down this road before
No one to switch the spare again
You got me you got a man for life
I swear that introduction was natural
But looking at it now you think we got to plan it twice
Like I’m linked between both worlds
I’m missing that old girl
Sitting down still wishing they still make them like my old girl
Learn to separate my at home girl from my own girl
Never judge a book by its cover to the facts is constant
It ain't shit to read if the table ain't got no content
I just want to know

[Chorus:]
I just want to go back to the old girl
The kind you just couldn't take home and hit
The old girl the type that wouldn't take your shit
The old girl her mama  though her everything
If you want it you going to need a ring
If you hear what I’m trying to say
I want the old girl
