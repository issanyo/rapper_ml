She said, "Hi, how are you?" she said, "konnichiwa"
She said, "pardon my french," I said, "bonjour, madame"
Then she said, "sak pass," and I said, "n'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love you all

I'm feelin 'kinda young I'm feelin' reckless
Let me hold you let me grab you by the necklace
I'll show you what good lovin 'and sex is
It turns you on when I got you feelin' helpless

And imma eat you out for dinner lunch and breakfast
Bring your friends along cause they are on the guest list
We can fool around till haa ahh haa I'm breathless
Hold off the drinks, out my body feelin 'selfless

She's telling me this
And telling me that
You said you're taking me with you, I'll never go back
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach
I'ma show you that from you do not matter to me

She said
Hello Hello Hello
Hello Hello Hello. How are you? "
Hi .. Hi .. Hi .. Hello
You know I love them all

Stupid sick nasty ass drop

Now I do not speak in her language, I see it in her eyes
Yeah I see it in her eyes, that she wants me in her life
And though she will not understand it oh I can not say no lie
She's the Coca cola bottle shape to it to run di place are

Turn around and come back again
Fuck me like it's - like it's revenge
I'll twist your body round 'like a wrench
Screamin' in the back of my benz, I sing again

She said
Hello Hello Hello
Hello Hello Hello. How are you? "
Hi .. Hi .. Hi .. Hello
You know I love them all

Second stupid sick nasty ass drop
