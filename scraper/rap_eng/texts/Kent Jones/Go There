I just want to let you know  Ma, that I just wanna thank you for everything

I love you so very much

I love you too Momma

(Chorus 1): David Correy
My momma told me not to cry
Gotta beam myself up when I'm down
Follow my name in the flashing lights
Those flashing lights
Where I belong (x2)

(Verse 1): David Correy
So is the tale of the struggle
A go getter, young hustler
A couple bucks in his pocket
Both hands on The Bible
Praying for revival
Seen the ups, seen the downs tryna come back around full circle
He saw enough to find a way
Even harder to just fight just to get through every day
It's a hard knock life for us (x2)
No matter what it takes, please show, show me the way
It's a cold world
It's a hard knock life for us (x2)
I'm going home everyday, but I need you causeâ€¦

(Chorus 2): David Correy
Really wanna go there, but I'm heading fast nowhere
Feeling like I'm hanging on
What's it gonna take to feel strong
Know I need to go there
Through the rain & the fire
What's it gonna take to know that I'm all I need to breathe

(Chorus 1): David Correy
My momma told me not to cry
Gotta beam myself up when I'm down
Follow my name in the flashy lights
Those flashy lights
Where I belong (x2)

(Verse 2): Locksmith
And I can still remember the moments when you would smile at me
How could I pretend for a moment that there's a side of me
Doesn't wish that I was there with you
Lady I miss you
You're an angel so you're hanging where you were meant to
I'm living and taking my life to new heights, that's the reason it stings
Feeling worthless, you gave me purpose
You believed in my dreams
I'm thinking back to when I rapped with friends
You would let us use your garage to get our practice in, see
I know life's hard on us, just hold on tight, don't rush
Is what you told me as I snickered with my homies
Thinking we know it all, there was so much more you would show me
If I open up my heart, then my blessins come
You fall short, that's the part where you learn your lessons from (I know)
You can't expect to win them all, but I know you're there to catch me when I fall

(Chorus 2): David Correy
Really wanna go there, but I'm heading fast nowhere
Feeling like I'm hanging on
What's it gonna take to feel strong
Know I need to go there
Through the rain & the fire
What's it gonna take to know that I'm all I need to breathe

Oh somewhere out there
There's a star with your name on it
You got fight hard if you want the world to see

(Chorus 1): David Correy
My momma told me not to cry
Gotta beam myself up when I'm down
Follow my name in the flashy lights
Those flashy lights
Where I belong

(Chorus 2): David Correy
Really wanna go there, but I'm heading fast  nowhere
Feeling like I'm hanging on
What's it gonna take to feel strong
Know I need to go there
Through the rain & the fire
What's it gonna take to know that I'm all I need to breathe

(Chorus 1): David Correy
My momma told me not to cry
Gotta beam myself up when I'm down
Follow my name in the flashy lights
Those flashy lights
Where I belong (x2)
