[Verse:]
Trying to be patient man
But you looking so damn right tonight
And i completely understand
One night and i infatuated
Promise if i wait it gets better
So what must i do if you promise to put it down
Will be fine when i put it down
All that i wanted is to feel your love
But you holding on and
Hooking up work with me
Work with me
Trying to fit in where i can
Oh yeah but you so locked up so that i can't break in
I’ll admit i made some plans for you
Then i sense i feel kind of afraid of you
Promise to as we go it gets better
So amma just do if you promise to put it down
When we finally put it down
All that i wanted is to feel your love
But you holding on and
Hooking up work with me work with me oh
Oh yea i want my body all over your body like
Oh yea i never had to wait this long on nobody but

And i can't wait to work it
Oh now I’m a pull little into her any time in it
And later on I’m a get it
Promise if you wait it gets better so
Amma just do
If you promise to put it down
When we finally put it down
All that i wanted is to feel your love
But you holding on and
Hooking up work with me
