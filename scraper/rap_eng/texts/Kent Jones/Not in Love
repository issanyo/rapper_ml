[Verse 1: Nadine]
You're always drunk when you come around
I know you think that you got me down
Funny 'cause you couldn't be more wrong
I throw you right back, I bet you hate that

[Pre-Chorus 1: Annie]
I'm done tryna talk with your speakers loud
You don't give me love, you give me nothing
And it feels so good as I'm walking out
Out of your house, I'm a screaming

[Chorus: Nadine, M.O]
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you, in love with you

[Verse 2: Frankee]
Here we go, another six missed calls
I'll be a hypocrite and miss them all
I gave you me, but you pay me no time, no time
No love right now, now you wanna turn time

[Pre-Chorus 2: Annie]
So I hope you have, have a lovely night
With your video games and your excuses
Boy, it feels so good as I'm walking out
I slam the door, 'cause I mean it

[Chorus: Nadine, M.O]
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you, in love with you

[Verse 3: Kent Jones]
Stop letting your girls get in the middle of things
You act like staying's a decisional thang
Every time you record when we doing our thing
I'm like, "Girl, put that away, why you playin' them video games?"
I can see your halo and them physical thing
Just came back from nowhere, but here we go again
Conversation been going for too long
This time, we gon' see who the fool on
You told me you get cold feet
That's why we had to go out and get our shoes on

[Chorus: M.O]
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love, I'm not in love no more
And I wanna shout it and tell the world
I-I-I love it, I'm not your girl
No, I'm not in love with you, in love with you

[Outro: M.O]
I'm not in love, not in love, not in love with ya
I'm not in love, not in love, not in love with ya
It made my day to know I'll see no more of ya
I'm not in love, not in love, not in love with ya
