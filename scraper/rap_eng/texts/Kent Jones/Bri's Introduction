[Verse 1]
She said Mr. Jones
I love the way you differ
I love the way you talk to me
I love the way you ain’t sniffin' in my business
I said it, my pardon
But, I like the way you been missing
All my life, shit
I swear to God
I thought I found the one for me
Twice
But yah
You say that he Mr. Right
But she can’t see him
What we wanna be will never come
Until we know how to become
Asking you what’s wrong
Your attitude won't give me a minute
You say my words are way too sharp
I say it’s just a spearmint
Saying infatuation might be a crush
All of our conversations seem to make her blush
I’m never disgusted by any discussions
She ain’t looking for money
Lookin' for fun so she can invest her trust in

[Hook]
Here we go
Sometimes, I wish I hadn't made it past her love
Sometimes, I wish I hadn't made it past her love
Sometimes, I wish I hadn't made it past her love
The love
So finally I can
Say…
Now I do love, love
From the moment that you introduce yourself
Ooohhh, ohhhhh
Here we go…
Sometimes, I wish I hadn't made it past her love
Sometimes, I wish I hadn't made it past her love
Sometimes, I wish I hadn't made it past her love
I wonder what would happen if we made it past her love
Hello, your introduction

[Verse 2]
She go to church with condoms
But she forget her Bible
[Laughs]
I don’t know where to start first
She says she’s been down this road before
And she needs a title
I told learn how to ride and get a car first
Even when we don’t see the stars in shooting form
I gave you the business
Now you shaking like two palms
Your dark side is cold when we go to war
You tell me use my hands solo
Instead of trying to keep lukewarm
It’s better to move on than move in cycles
Proof
Jesus was betrayed, once
By his Disciples
And Obama missed shells like he dodged a rifle
But, young ego high as fuck
Missionary on an Eiffel
