I think I fucked in the hallway
But its better in the classroom
But i took in the backroom
Oopps, I'm in the bathroom
Fuck, we don;t have room
But she wanna get ??
She wanna get love baby
I ain't got all day
But i told my baby cash rules
She said "What you mean the cash rules?"
I only follow cash rules
I think I put her in a bad mood
But they didn't tel her I'll be glad too

[Hook]
You better act like you knoooooooooow better
You better act like you knoooooooooow better
You better act like you know
You better act like you knoooooooooow better
You better act like you know
You better act like you know better

[Verse 2]
Drug dealers on a cruise ship
That's a dealership
King Kush on a  big boat
I got 33 ounces bitch, that's leadership
You say you high, I'm Cumulus
I told her let me bone
She said I'm humorous
She tried o get me to put in work
But, I called off
I need a bitch with big lips
My dick don;t like small talk
I'm tryna get this money as them hours pass
Pouring Henny every 60 minutes in an hourglass
All my niggas made, but we ain't  fall
Fresh bread from the bank
Butter on my bankroll

[Prehook + Hook]

[Verse 3]
I told her I'm the past, present and future
She said it makes sense
No wonder why you stay tense
Great menage, genocide
Dropped the gate, like we fucked by the fence
I can never trust her, so you know I got it
On my Iphone, no editing
Cause these hoes are dressed like add-ons
They make up everything
You can shop for love, but it ain't registering
I said no strings attached
Cause I'm happy with the situation I am in
She agreed, but every time I leave
I hear a violin
