[Intro: Fuse ODG & Sean Paul]
It's Fuse, ayy!
Yeah
It's a worldwide movement
Sigala-la, ayy!
Sean-a-Paul
Bida bang bang bang
Let's go

[Verse 1: Fuse ODG & Sean Paul]
If there's life in the east, that's where I will go
Born in the streets, I know where I'm from
If you're asking for me, you already know
Turn up
Where the vibe is, I call my home

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fuse ODG & Sean Paul]
The air that I breathe
Is the same everywhere
So where's the party? (we on the street)
'Cause I'm gonna be there
The air that we breathe
Is the same everywhere

[Chorus: Fuse ODG & Sean Paul]
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like (hey!)
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like home (bida bang bang bang)
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home

[Verse 2: Sean Paul]
Tell dem
We can't bother with the lame ting, tell dem
No, no, no, no
Tell dem
Turn up the bass well loud
And make the gyal dem go low, low
Tell dem
We can't bother with the waitin', tell dem
Go go go go

[Pre-Chorus 2: Sean Paul]
Anywhere mi lay mi hat, ah deh so me ah call home
Well you feel this love escalating
Tell dem
Just make it grow
And you know we live our lives celebrating
Mad people thing, they should know
Well you know we view this life as a great ting
Just let jah jah love a glow
Any step, mi step, mi step

[Chorus: Fuse ODG, Sean Paul & Kent Jones]
Wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home (Fuse tell dem again)
It feels like home
It feels like home (live it up till the end)
It feels like home
It feels like home (with me and my friends)
It feels like home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like
It feels like home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like
Home
It feels like
Home
It feels like
It feels like
Home
Home, is here, yeah

[Bridge: Kent Jones]
I live a life of a Rollin' Stone
Wherever I lay my hat's my home
Tell me where you are and girl I'm gone
Meet me at LAX, won't be long
I'll be right there you won't have to search
Dollars I left, my Uber don't work

[Pre-Chorus 3: Kent Jones]
Don't feel special 'cause I let you know
I'm good everywhere, I go

[Chorus: Fuse ODG, Sean Paul & Kent Jones]
Wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home (Fuse tell dem again)
It feels like home
It feels like home (live it up to the end)
It feels like home
It feels like home (with me and my friends)
It feels like home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like
Home (turn up)
Home
It feels like
Home
It ain't where I live
But wherever the good vibe is
It feels like home
