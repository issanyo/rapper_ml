[Verse]

I guess I understand why being satisfied doesn't always promise satisfaction
The happy girls to me are mad attractive
The ones that play it aggressive here are just not as passive
The ones that talk about sex the most really not as active
The others orgasm with passion but show no compassion
I had delivery before contraction, you know delivery with no contractions
While I'm birthing a new sound, you busy trying to match it
I like my females like my emails, no attachments
I'm the one these n*ggas fear when it's all said and done
I hear it all if it was said in ones
You telling people I know about how you feel about me
The way you hate, they wouldn't believe you only met me once
Hate my attitude and tell me why you still around me
Cos if you able to tell me what someone else says then how come they still comfortable talking about me around family
I swear some of the quite ones really the loudest
Rather keep it real then to just scream it and shout it
Fake is fake, Great Wall of China there's no way around it
A lot of my doubters hate but now all they the proudest
I'm as old as your child is but to me you just childish
I guess that PR is just another word for your stylist
Boy you clever boy, I know you clever
They hating on me cos they all know I could go forever
I read you niggas before you fold, open letter

Strong opinions and no resume to back it up don't go together
Your sh*t sound like broken records, never broke a record
Told you long ago who I was and what it was I'm here to do
I guess you ain't believe me
And you can smile all day
But trying to talk me out my gut feeling is not as easy
I learnt that publicists have a hard time learning to have a personal life
Oh oh, I know somebody took that personal right?
I ain't got no time to focus on the sh*t you do wrong
I don't go back and forth, I got too many verses to write
Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Sir please leave him alone
Why can't you just focus on one song?
I only short talk because my verses are so long
Play fair, play fair, guess it's scary still
Ya'll contracts DD in store pickles, you share a deal

Too many rugrats trying to appear on the surface
I ain't accidentally dope it's clear we here with a purpose
Going off like its 06 and I'm bout to make the city blow
Cool N Dre, Khaled and Ross it started here with Joe
It's my destination if you ever see me reaching
Hip hop restoration if you ever see me preaching
His family told him he should be a deacon heathen
Bless the nations of the hip hop heathers
Turned all the breaking points into points they can't prove
Same n*gga in class they saw as a lame dude
Could walk into a McDonald's cos I'm best friends with the owner
Found out he and the employees attended the same school
