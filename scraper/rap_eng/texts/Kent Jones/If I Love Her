[Hook]
She said if I love her, I would fuck her without a rubber
Fuck her without a rubber
She said if I love her, I would fuck her without a rubber
Fuck her without a rubber
Nah, I can't do it nah
I can't do it hell nah
Hell nah, I can fuck around
Hell nah, hell nah
Hell nah, I can fuck around
Hell nah, hell nah

[Verse 1]
I can fuck around
Walk up in the trap house got the coke up in the jar
Fucked so many niggas, if you wife her she a dog
Walk up in the hotel with the gun up in the bra
Man hell nah, I done seen it all
She just wanna strip and fuck but she won't get a job
Man she got a baby daddy but he got the problems
Daddy never raised her and the mama wasn't around

[Hook]
She said if I love her, I would fuck her without a rubber
Fuck her without a rubber
She said if I love her, I would fuck her without a rubber
Fuck her without a rubber
Nah, I can't do it nah

Hell nah, I can fuck around
Hell nah, hell nah
Hell nah, I can fuck around
Hell nah, hell nah

[Verse 2]
She just want it all
Kids home today she shoppin' at the mall
Everybody know she givin' up the drawers
She a stripper and she runnin' from the law
I can’t trust her nah, swear this bitch crazy
Sellin' pussy but she drive a new Mercedes
Baby daddy’s can’t even remember babies
And she wanna be my lady

[Hook]
She said if I love her, I would fuck her without a rubber
Fuck her without a rubber
She said if I love her, I would fuck her without a rubber
Fuck her without a rubber
Nah, I can't do it nah
I can't do it hell nah
Hell nah, I can fuck around
Hell nah, hell nah
Hell nah, I can fuck around
Hell nah, hell nah
