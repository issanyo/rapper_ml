[Intro: Kent Jones]
Kent, Jones, treble, treble, treble

[Verse 1: Mia Martina]
You know where I come from
Day show in the night
Go along, yeah I’ve been keepin' motion
Busy girls stay up all night on
And I know I keep you callin', even though I stay my distance
You know they say
There's something to be said about persistence

[Pre-Chorus: Mia Martina]
You know I’m a fool for that
The way you’re movin, I’m a fool for that
Show a girl just what you’d do for this
Say you love me and I say I know, I know
Yeah you know I’m a fool for that
Got me wonderin' what I’d do with that
Let you ride to the moon and back
Never forget it, keep doin' what you doin'
Ain’t no stopping where we headed cause

[Chorus: Mia Martina & (Kent Jones)]
Sooner or later, you got me callin' (oh yeah, oh)
Yeah sooner or later, you got me callin' (oh yeah)
(Sooner or later girl, you got me callin'
So I can’t keep stallin')
Sooner or later, you got me callin' (oh yeah, oh)

[Verse 2: Kent Jones]
Why why why why you gotta move like that?
Why you gotta dress so so rude like that?
I ain’t even gon' try to pursue like that
‘Cause the rich rich love to get sued like that
So I stay away, even though we both know
I could never stay away, love like the LA
We ain’t even got no lay away, think you out the pay away
You still ended up having to pay away

[Pre-Chorus: Mia Martina]
You know I’m a fool for that
The way you’re movin, I’m a fool for that
Show a girl just what you’d do for this
Say you love me and I say I know, I know
Yeah you know I’m a fool for that
Got me wonderin' what I’d do with that
Let you ride to the moon and back
Never forget it, keep doin' what you doin'
Ain’t no stopping where we headed cause

[Chorus: Mia Martina & (Kent Jones)]
Sooner or later, you got me callin' (oh yeah, oh)
Yeah sooner or later, you got me callin' (oh yeah)
(Sooner or later girl, you got me callin'
So I can’t keep stallin')
Sooner or later, you got me callin', callin' (oh yeah, oh)

[Bridge: Mia Martina]
You know I’m showin' the signs for you (na na na na oh yeah)
‘Cause I’m good, that’s why I got you callin’ now (now now now now)
I know know I’ve been acting shy on you
‘Cause I know the truth, I’ll be the one you hold down

[Chorus: Mia Martina & (Kent Jones)]
Yeah sooner or later, you got me callin' (oh yeah, oh)
Yeah sooner or later, you got me callin' (oh yeah)
(Sooner or later girl, you got me callin'
So I can’t keep stallin')
Sooner or later, you got me callin', callin' (oh yeah, oh)

[Outro: Mia Martina]
Sooner or later, you got me callin'
Yeah sooner or later, you got me callin', callin'
