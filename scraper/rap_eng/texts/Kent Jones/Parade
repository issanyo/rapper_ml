[Intro]
Get up, get up!
Get up, goddamnit!

[Chorus]
Everybody know who the fuck I am
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
(Get up!)
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, do you miss me?
You know I hope you do
I was destined to make it
I know I'm overdue
The podcast on smash I'm jumping over you
Talkin' ten millions in streams with no sober view
Cabrón! Maricón!
[?] I feel right at home
They want with some Gucci and my hoodie down
Cause I've been running wild at least 20 now
And I would never think this when I'm selling weight
2017, feel like 1998
I knew this was it, soon as I heard it
This my parade and I deserve it

[Chorus]
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
(Get up!)
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ay yo it's been a long time
I shouldn't have left you
Without that N.O.R. shit to step to
Know these weak dudes that you slept through
Times up, I'm sorry I kept you
Streets love me, I get love there
Superthug raised in the mud there
Camouflage morning with the thug there
[?] in Dubai, but ain't no bud yet
Slime on this grown man
Surfboards and beaches, permanent gold tan
I knew this was it, soon as I heard of it
Haz [?] and Swiss Beatz they murdered it

[Chorus]
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
(Get up!)
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
She said it feel like it's New Years (yeah, yeah)
That's because everything is new here
She said it feel like it's New Years (yeah, yeah)
That's because everything is new here
She said it feel like it's New York(yeah, yeah)
That's because every day is new year
I had that old bitch for 12 months
And I call my new bitch on new year's

[Chorus]
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
(Get up!)
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
Yeah, yeah

Tell 'em throw me a parade
Poppin' bottles in the hood
Like I just beat a case (Gotti)
Barely in the town, prolly somewhere out of state
Sitting in the sun, while they still throwing shade
Let the haters hate, cause they going through a phase
Tunnel vision on the money, know you see the Cartiers
And y'all know my name from the streets to the stage
Screamin I'm back got me feelin like I'm Mase

[Chorus]
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
(Get up!)
I'm back, I'm back, okay (okay)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
I tell 'em throw me a parade (tell 'em throw me a parade)
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I'm back, I'm back, okay
I tell 'em throw me a parade
I tell 'em throw me a parade
I'm back, I'm back, okay
I tell 'em throw me a parade
I tell 'em throw me a parade
Yeah, yeah
