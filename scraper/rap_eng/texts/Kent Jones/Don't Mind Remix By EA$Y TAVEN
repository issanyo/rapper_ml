All my girls
Around the world

Hook
She telling me this
She telling me that
I would walk across
The Ocean
If you let me touch that
I would jump into fire
If you let me kiss that
Just know
No matter where I go
I'm in love with them all
This is tha remix baby
You are my sunshine baby
I wanna ride with you
Like Rodeo
We can go anywhere
That you wanna go
From downtown M-Town
To Mexico

Verse 1
I fall in love so quickly
I get involved so deeply
Believe or not
This ain't reeply
I love the girls
That always indy
All my wishes are granted
I wish we never departed
They just pretend
But your love is
Truly
Give that to me
Girl our love is holly
All my clothes imported
And my style exotic
I got that African Accent

Bridge
I don't fix love with a bandage
I don't wanna drag you in garbage
EA$Y TAVEN they know
I'm a Savage
And I don't do revenge

Hook
She telling me this
She telling me that
I would walk across

If you let me touch that
I would jump into fire
If you let me kiss that

No matter where I go
I'm in love with them all
This is tha remix baby
You are my sunshine baby
I wanna ride with you

We can go anywhere
That you wanna go
From downtown M-Town
To Mexico

Verse 2
Not matter
Where there from
You know I love
Them all
They say konichiwa
And I say hello
You are the one
That I've been searching for
I love exotic girls
They bring international energy
I pulled in my city
Looking like
John F Kennedy
I don't have all the answers
But I got  keys and remedy
So why dont you stay
With me
Not for 1 night
But forever
We are in this together
You can call me whenever
You know
I got you for a favour
Yeah Yeah

If you let me touch that
