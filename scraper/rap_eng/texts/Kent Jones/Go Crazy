[Intro: Fat Joe]
Na, na, na, na, na
I ain't trippin'
I mean your life could change drastically, facts
Women ain't supposed to work, nah
I respect it, though, I respect it
Supposed to enjoy every minute of your life
Let a man do a man's job

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I know you're feeling type-secure, Instagram model
And at night, you're moving gold bottles
At times it's like the money and fame is more like drugs
And I'm the don of all dons, plug of all plugs
Bein' broke and thirty give a woman the chills
Slip you outta that dress, fell right in them heels
'Cause you so, so, so, so, so, so, so
Fuckin' with a nigga this real
Pink diamonds is dancin' like they walkin' for cancer
Weekends in the Hamptons, wakin' up to get pampered
Hoppin' off the phone, touch of the gold clutch, you so up
And niggas mad you chose up
You fuckin' with the don
Fashion week in Greece and Milan
I'll flood your whole arm with charms
Suites on the Emirates, turkey bacon and eggs benedict
Butter croissant, French benefits, mile high

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
If you never said a word
Your body tell me all, all about it
I'm the one that you prefer
Your actions tell me all about it
Nobody do it like me
'Cause you tell me all about it
That's why no one else excites me
I would tell you all about it
I like the simple things that your love will bring
But you constantly reject the finer things
And if you walk away from me (I know, I know)

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
I'll go crazy (I know, I know)
I'll go insane (I know, I know)
I'll go crazy (I know, I know)
I'll go insane, oh

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
It's the don and Remy Revlon, believe I'm worth it
I got a nice set, oh they perkin'
See the ass all perfect,  he said I shouldn't be workin'
Told me get in my bag, I'm all in my Birkin
This my wave, I'm surfin'
I told him "Stop, it's hurtin'"
I said, "Nah," but meant, "Yes"
I let him put his work in
Alexandre Vauthier type shit I purchase
Giambattista Valli, bitch, Google search it
Now see my boots is a liar but my nigga the truth
I'm blastin' fire and desire when I'm whippin' that coupe
Dead in the middle of the winter, shit be missin' the roof
He started kissin' on my friend, I started kissin' her too, oops

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
If you never said a word
Your body tell me all, all about it
I'm the one that you prefer
Your actions tell me all about it
Nobody do it like me
'Cause you tell me all about it
That's why no one else excites me
I would tell you all about it
I like the simple things that your love will bring
But you constantly reject the finer things
And if you walk away from me (I know, I know)

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
I'll go crazy (I know, I know)
I'll go insane (I know, I know)
I'll go crazy (I know, I know)
I'll go insane, oh

[Outro: Sevyn Streeter]
Oh just say yes
Fuck me and console me
Love me 'til the morning
Can I get a repeat?
Oh just say yes
Fuck me and console me
Love me 'til the morning
Can I get a repeat?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
