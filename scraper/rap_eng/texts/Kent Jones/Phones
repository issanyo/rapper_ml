[Verse 1: iON LIL GUT]
I just pulled up in a coupe
Yeah, my diamonds look so cool
Yeah, your bitch, she said I'm cool
30,000 on my jewels
30,000 on my wrist, I'm frozen
Got a bad bitch, yeah, she say I'm chosen
Yeah, my mama, yeah, she told me that I'm golden
Willy Wonka, nigga, yeah I'm really gold
Baby, you's a show
Really, I'm the coldest
Really, I'm the coldest
Skrt!

[Chorus: iON LIL GUT]
Baby don't look through my phone
Baby don't look through my phone
Yesterday I said I love you but today I said I don't
'Cause you the show, yeah, you the show
Baby don't look through my phone
Baby don't look through my phone
Yesterday I said I love you but today I said I don't
'Cause you the show, yeah, you the show

[Verse 2: Kent Jones]
Tell her man I love her, man I don't even mean it
Other than a (?), that shit is between us
She say that she send messages, I don't even read 'em
Just because I didn't reply don't mean I ain't seen them
50,000 on my wrist, I'm a caveman bitch
I'm (?) Shan, frozen blue faces
No cap, but they melting, so I drip hard
And if the dance was heartfelt, yeah, I tip her
50 on my wrist, a mansion
I'm a caveman with blue faces
I ain't really into new faces
Unless they blue faces
I know plenty who done chased it
But I don't know many who done taste it
You be on that sit around and wait shit
I'm about to go and get a spaceship
'Scuse me, I'm about to get and get a new spaceship
It's April and she say her birthday next month
I ain't tryna be fucking with no May tricks
So quit calling my phone for confrontation

[Chorus: iON LIL GUT]
Baby don't look through my phone
Baby don't look through my phone
Yesterday I said I love you but today I said I don't
'Cause you the show, yeah, you the show
Baby don't look through my phone
Baby don't look through my phone
Yesterday I said I love you but today I said I don't
'Cause you the show, yeah, you the show
