Aha...Pete Rock..aha..Pete rock
Hail..!
It's Bumpy Knuckles Baby..HA
Aha

(Verse 1: Freddie Foxxx)
I'm from a world where a man of my complexion makes no laws
And we struggle like madmen hustling for
Top position my hip-hop style crosses every boundery
Now who sound like me?
While like I'm Bumpy Knuck Bill Freddie Manson
Smacking up fake ass rappers that's soft like the hansons
I've been ripping used dancers
When niggers had high top fades and kid and played
I was cancer..Sick
Move back bumpy's got this groove back
But Wait I must correct myself B cause bumpy never loose that
Pete Rock blesses me with beats like that Halloween treats
And I spit it for these rugged ass streets
So it talked too cold how am I presented
Better than me I'm God-sent cause how you'll keep the god bent
I'm a hip-hop creator blacker than Darth Vader
I'll be Bumpy Knuckles now I'll be Bumpy Knuckles later
Come On!

(Chorus)
It's the international illest MC
Bumpy Knuckles baby and the Muro MC
With Pete Rock chopping the beats cross the fata
From New York to Japan Hip-Hop creators
*scratch* Dunn these niggers thought they started something wild (Nas)
*scratch* I spit shit *scratch*
Freddie foxxx, check it out(Guru)
*scratch*

(Verse 2: Muro)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Freddie Foxxx)
Feel it
I smile at the truth, I smile at the youth
When this song come out hot, I smile in the booth
I smile as a mack that flashed his gold tooth
And I smiled in the proj getting head on the roof
Niggers that know my stylo
Know that I be low
Seldom seen that's how I creep the cream
Know what I mean?
I've been in the game for udeen
In Japan counting Yen like American Cream

(Muro)

(Chorus)
