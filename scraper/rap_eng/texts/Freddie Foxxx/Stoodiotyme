[Intro]
Word
To the beat
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's why Bumpy Knuckles still rap y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's why Bumpy Knuckles still rock y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's why Bumpy Knuckles still rap y'all

[Verse]
This mic I use, like my staff
And I'll wreck any rapper in my path
It's been a long time coming since I had
To shake so much hate, niggas being petty
Claiming they're great, no way
Coming at Bump, that's your first mistake
I'm so raw, coke mics, smoke mics, flow tight
Pac, you was right, these niggas is busters
More flights trying to get away from these ho types
Oh right, a lot of niggas, I don't trust them
I got a shit bag list in my head
And I read it every time I lay my head
Raw flow, MC shit, it's my time
'Cause everybody got to get their time
I still write mines, notepads everywhere
Autograph every page, left bottom page
You can read it but you'll probably never get it
In the booth tryna spit it but you really just can't get it
That growl, that bark, that bite
That pitbull rip a nigga face off tonight
Ha, right, touch the mic
Bump Knucks, rock rock on
Premo the boom bap, twist it into goon rap
We make hot fajitas to feed the next Derek Jeters
As a boy coming up, I watched Cold Crush
And really studied Kay Gee voice, she was coming up
I'm JDL, ha, ha ha ha
The girl taker AD baby, it's my call
But I paid close attention to GM Caz
I used to pay cash to go see him spaz
Them New York, New York, them hot Sinatras
Presence on the mic, corrupt the mobsters
And in the name of the God, I vow to never quit
Rip, Taheem Shabazz, one forever with
Never forget my grind, my hustle
Ups and downs, tussles, scuffles
Rob niggas, took duffles, tryna get studio time
