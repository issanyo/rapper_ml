[Hook]
Teach the children, help my brother
Love my sister, study each other
It's time we learn, we breath the same
So I feel pain, when you feel pain

Teach the children

[Intro: Freddie Foxxx]
For the juvenile minds of the world, yes

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I look up at the moon and the stars and I wish that I can go
Just to see if there's another place to spread my flow
Freddie Foxxx spits fertilizer, young minds grow
Now I'm letting all the shorties in the whole world know
I be the book of life, darker than black
I'm not recessive or laid back, I'm right in your face, just [?]
Shorty watch me on your TV screen
106 & Park spit a mean 16
Metaphorically show shorties what they ain't seen
MC's and DJ's a two-man team, listen
With my own personality, I build my own trails
I write my own rhymes, I tell my own tales
Be a trendsetter, can we see good on Earth?
Take everything that comes my way for what's it worth
Keep only things around you that light your way
And you should find time to pray
Don't let nobody tell you what you can't be, listen, guard your soul
With a nice warm goose down, life is cold
Real life ain't Barney and Big Bird
Ask my man Barney who got life for moving with big birds
Learn math and science
So you can be part of the alliance, and please remember this
That I ain't afraid to be who I be
Cause who I am is something nobody can take from me
We gotta

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We gotta teach the children, how to be self-reliant
How to look life a small fry and think like a giant
Make the world compliant to everything you need
So that next kids will come up, so we can succeed
When you wake up in the morning to start your day
Bad news might turn you away
You should think about the people that died for you to be where you at
By the whips, by the chains, and the gats
Watch the snakes in the circle around you when you're putting it down
Hitting message in a hardcore sound
The gangs be busting and slashing in Corleone fashion
But they're crashing, bawling, black body they're blasting
See my daughter's a cute one, she wondering why
Me and Mommy don't see eye to eye
So I tell her that Daddy's not a bad guy, baby ain't a thorn
And I love you even more ever since you was born
Same with Bree and TaySean
The wars that I fight is so my shorties can sleep at night
That's why I tatted this tat right over my heart
So nobody ever tear us apart
We gotta

[Hook]

We gotta teach the children

Uh huh, listen
Can I kick it for the shorties of the world, yes
That's right
Can I kick it for my pretty little girl, yes
Everybody
For the juvenile minds of the world, yes
Huh huh

[Verse 3]
Don't underestimate the overhand right that life might throw
Cause the kids be the fire that light my flow
I spit it gangster so you know that when I'm done
You'll be picking up your paycheck without a gun
Got you knowing that the worst ain't even rough times
See I been to the bottom where it's all about crime
And the cops got one time to bag you
May kick, stomp, or drag you, see Im'ma keep it gully
Keep it Timb boots, keep it skully
If I get it in a French cut suit, they still can't bump me
Don't get caught up in these rap songs, don't be blind
Your favorite rapper's not the thug in his rhyme
So you dribble a rock, get the nicest crossover on the block
Let your jump shot buy a stock
That a whole 'nother door that you can unlock, learn these laws
Then help them get theirs, so you can get yours
And don't be offended by the schoolyard diss
Cause for the sake of the little ones, I exist
And baby girl, remember this
Only God is the nemesis
We gotta

[Hook x2]

We gotta teach the children

[Outro]
Ha, yeah
Can I kick it for the shorties of the world, yes
Can I kick it for my pretty little girl, yes
For the juvenile minds of the world, yes
C'mon
