[Intro]
Hard work, no doubt

[Hook]
We wanna hear that Preemo shit
Boom bap, underground, that Preemo shit
Hip-hop, hardcore, Preemo shit
He got fire for ya with Bumpy on it
Peep the Kolexxxion

[Verse 1]
Yo everybody know that Preem is a beast with the beats
He designed a lot of ways for these niggas to eat
Cause when Bumpy spits pain over Christopher Mart's art
It fed all the hood niggas running the streets
We lived the life, that's why I roll with a mic and gun
I'm Freddie Blassey, you fuck with me, I light you son
Why niggas ask me if rhyming is a part of my life
Cause I'm living on the line that's a part of the life
These niggas really don't write like they really don't fight
But I'm still not convinced that the game is dead
Because a few lame niggas wanna imitate skills
With their limited skills, fake can't imitate real
Fuck around, you get killed over kicks and snares
They got a well known Preemo feel, how the crowd feel
Make some noise for some real b-boys in the building
Now we teach the children

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My thought interpreted across this perm
Got me bullying this rap game like Big Perm
I know I promised y'all Amerikkkan Black, I didn't fall back
I'm letting wack niggas get some shine, I ain't all that
I'm still on track, tracks by the Preemo
Money on the table, I rob the casino
Raw like Pesci, smooth like DeNiro
I'm popping in the hood like the corner store hero
It's the boom, bap, snares crack
Like a motherfucker head when I'm swinging the bat
These wack niggas can't rap, and the reason for that
Is dumb niggas don't study, the lesson is that
The legend is back and I'ma school you fruitcakes, new fakes
Two-face smiling in the goon face
Money by the suitcase, with a worldwide nod
And the producer that we borrow from the God (rest in peace)
Let's go

[Hook]
