[Verse 1]
What you 'bout to hear, straight craziest
Higher level, nuclear MCin, I'm not paid for this
Because I'm made for this and hip hop history
None of my 19 albums have ever been miscellaneous
And I'm spontaneous
My radius goes out, the crowd falls out
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I pour out
To my jaws now, yep, I bring the claws out
Knocked them 26 city tours out
I'm the truth, you can believe or doubt
But for those that believe in MCs like these
Higher degrees in sacred keys, believe, we knockin' them all out
Believe in yourself, stop deceivin' yourself
You listenin' that garbage all day, depletin' your health
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them youngings on the radio today
I'm talkin' 'bout them old folks that program what they say
They hated it, debated hip hop way back in the day
Now they wanna destroy it, they ain't love it anyway
But they put it on the radio, then blast it on your TV
Tellin' you, "It's the way to go, right here, buy our CD"
And even when you get the CD, it's always a letdown
Cause you don't know about them MCs that truly get down

[Hook] x4
Get your mind right, you don't have to deal with hindsight
If you operate in foresight

[Verse 2]
Now you throw it up
You want respect, you want that victory, cohoo
You want that cash, you wanna live it up
Now you in the street, you have the E, you have Malcolmee
You independant and you feel the heat
But you will not give up, so now your phone ring and you pick it up
And it's your boy Park about to stick it up
It's the economy, he explain as he talk 'bout robbery
Right then you ax: "Now what's inside of me?
Am I a robba', robba'? Am I a shocka', shocka'?
Am I a robba', robba', robba', i'ma, i'ma, i'ma
Am I a robba', robba'? Am I a shocka', shocka'?
Am I a robba', robba', i'ma, i'ma, i'ma, i'ma hang the phone up
Cause you know what? I see the future
It may look good now but jail ain't what I'm used to
The soul says give not take without giving
If that's the real you, then that's how you should start living
But we frontin', frontin'
Still huntin', huntin' for somethin', somethin'
But all this huntin', stuntin' droke cluckin' is leavin' at nothing
Start dustin', reach on the shelf and dust your soul off
You put it there, gettin' your goal off

[Hook] x2
