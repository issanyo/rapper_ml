[Intro]
Come on
(Come on)
Yuh
(Come on)
Haha, you're among in this?

[Chorus]
When my feet stump
My heat pump, the streets jump
You don't want war (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If my feet stump
My heat pump, and the streets jump
Yeah, you don't want war (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
My feet stump
The heat pump, (yeah) streets (yeah) jump
Come on, you don't want war (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If my feet (nah) stump
My heat (uh) pump, and the streets jump
You don't want war

[Verse 1]
I knew the time when I was wanted by the D-Stone cops
For kickin' the hardcore music in the streets so hot
We never focused on the don't-haves, 'cause we have not
I put the focus on the vocab, now we have-nots
I brought the hood to the music and corrupted the sound
And went from state-to-state microphone bustin' it down
A lot of people really hate it, then they lovin' it now
'Cause they raised the label advance [?] sound

You don't really wanna throttle 'cause I might hurt you
Drama keep me flippin' just like that work do
Made a lot of songs about shit I would do
Always kept it underground just like that dirt do
Tryna [?] slippin'
I'll leave ya rams drippin'
I'll leave ya nose runnin'
I got the foes [?]
The streets relieve you rappin' is easy
But ya mom forget you left up in the pool of fo' sheezy

[Chorus]
If my feet stump (yeah)
My heat pump, (come on) the streets jump (no)
You don't want war (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If my feet (nah) stump
My heat (uh) pump, (uh-huh) and the streets (uh) jump
No, you don't want war
My feet (yeah) stump
All this (hey) heat (ho) pump, and the streets (yeah) jump (hey)
Come on, you don't want war
If my feet (hahaha) stump
My heat (uh) pump, the streets (nah) jump
Yeah, you don't want war

[Verse 2]
Not many men can walk the fine line of death and desire
I'm on my Rick James
Yeah, my death is my retire
Right hand'll get ya eye black, left in the fire
The left hand'll get ya [?] jaws in the fire
I take the crew to make it work for me
Just like a lie
And bring of shit to ya, just like a fly
Freddie Foxxx back in the game, the question is: "Why?"
And the answer is: 'Cause I don't see the streets in ya eye

Off the top rope I fly
Landin' the hammer
Hard on ya head, like Chinese grammar
Yeah, we got cars, and we pay people to drive 'em
I'm behind bard with the punchlines up inside 'em
You can talk about the thug life, but you ain't hot
You'll be posin' for a mugshot, and you'll get dropped
'Cause the long arm in the streets corrupts some cops
They used to help Freddie Foxxx stick up blocks

[Chorus]
When my feet (yeah) stump
The heat (haha) pump, the streets (yeah) jump
Come on, you don't want war (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
When my feet stump
(Yeah) The heat (uh) pump, when my streets (uh) jump (yeah)
Come on, you don't want war
When my feet (yeah) stump
The heat (uh) pump, my streets (yeah) (hahahaha) jump
Come on, you don't want war (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
When my feet (uh) stump
And that heat (uh) pump, and them streets (uh) jump
B, you don't want war

[Verse 3]
I put the rap game metaphor inside of the ring
And took the Heavyweight title belt, and gave it to Bling
I put the battery in John Cena that made him a beast
And made it safe for World Wrestling to come in the streets
Now, we eat like kings
The pinkie ring is bigger
Try to take it back to the basement
Holla at me, Tigger
It's the forty-five don
I'm scared of nothin'
And no one, 'cause most of these cats bluffin'
I take it all, and give 'em nothin', like real pimps do
Don't leave 'em fancy cars unlocked, we steal 'em, too
The grimiest, grimin' is dude that eat y'all food
And put a gag order on the hood, I wish y'all would
Tell the cop my name, my face
Show him a flick
I'll put it point-blank at ya face, and blow at it quick
Everybody know the program, I'm showin' the flick
It's called "Murder in the Rap Game Deucin' a Hit"
Let's bump!

[Chorus]
Feet (yeah) stump
(Come on) Heat (yeah) pump, (woo) my streets (uh) jump
Yo, you don't want war (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
When my feet (ooh) stump
My heat (aah) pump, the streets (oh) jump
Nah, you don't want war
When my feet stump
The heat pump, and my streets jump
B, you don't want war
When my feet stump
This heat pump, and them streets jump
Nah, you don't want war

[Outro]
Come on! Yeah

Let's [?] mob, yeah!
