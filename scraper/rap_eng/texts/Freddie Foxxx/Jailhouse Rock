[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
This is for my niggas in the jailhouse, jailhouse
This is for my niggas in jail

[Verse One]
I wake up early in the morning then I come on my block
I bust a hundred push-ups to know that I'm cock
I go to break chow with my posse in the messhall
Then I hit the horn cause I gotta make a phone call
Now every time I hit the yard I stick my jammy in the grass
In case I get some drama then I cook a nigga's ass
I see an old timer who's a porter
When I was runnin wild on the streets I was pimpin on his daughter
He hit me with a fat bag of donuts
I think he was a homo, because I heard he blow nuts
But see, I'm a real G from the streets
So I let him know I don't fuck with the beast
You never let a nigga play you close in the yard
Cause sleepin in the yard you can always get scarred
C'mon~!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I pump a lot of iron and I do my calisthetics
Cause in jail it ain't no such thing as cybergenics
I try to hit the bag, help relieve a little stress
I'm waitin for a visit from my girl and I'm pressed
I got my state pants and I'm sportin black silk with my gators
I slide up on my homey tell him "Yo nigga, see you later"
I hate goin through the strip search
It makes you feel like less than a man and the shit hurts
But ain't fallin for the white man's stress test
I'm tryin to go home, so I do my best, yes
I try to stay strong, many wanna see me fail
This is for my niggas in jail, yeah

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse Three]
Sixteen weeks to go, I'm tryin to make it back to the street again
Makin big plans how to get back on my feet again
I run and hustle on tier like a straight up con-man
So why does Freddie Foxxx got the bomb man
I gotta smoke before I go to the board again
Hit the law books, so when I go to court again
I can be sharp and have my game tight
So when I look into the the judge's eyes, he can think it's all right
My fuckin lawyer is a sucker
But when it comes to gettin niggas appeals, he's a bad motherfucker!
The D.A. hates my guts
She wants to see me in the hole, hangin by my nuts
But never will I fail
Because I give love to my niggas in jail, yeah

[Chorus] - 2X
