[Freddie FOXX]
Check this shit out, this is for my man Blastmaster Krs One
And if you ever have a son, Im a buy him a gun

Give that microphone
So I can take it to the front line
Cuz In a rap war, I shoot off rhymes
And sound off a bark like an M-16
When I hit the scene, suckas turn green
Cuz I take the microphone and then I disrespect it
And then I dissect it
Put it back together
Lyrics or knuckles man whatever
Cuz you tried to step into a lyrical punch
I had you all for lunch and took a shit
Out came a hit
You suckas betta quit
Fuckin wit Freddie Foxx you get lit
Now listen all respect due to the Blastmaster Krs One
Now Im done.....

Yes but of course, you could never be done
Because we a de number 1

[KRS-ONE]
Now all type things that went on this evening
They all say they fresh but I'm here now
Who you believin
Who couldn't hear a hit if you hit up
What a pity, you tried to be quick wit the tongue
Your style is dibbie-dibbie
You need no lyrical rush
And you're your mumbling what you're saying
I serve you up like Stove Top stuffing
Im gonna say this once and I mean this:
Disattach yaself from my penis
Give my genitals room to breathe
You take shots at me wit a weak album I can't believe
You got no skills, chill, plus your corny
You think your hardcore cuz you got a 40?
My car is not tint
I dont eat wit a chimp
When I read I don't squint
In real life I got the hard shit
You can't out grow me
You don't even know me
I be leaving the jam wit your black ass as a trophy
This is nobody's style but the teacher
So dont compare me to none of these creature-feature
Arthur Treacher egg battered rappers
KRS-ONE is the hand-clapper
