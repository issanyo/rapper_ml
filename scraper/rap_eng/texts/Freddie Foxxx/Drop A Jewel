[Intro]
Nothing is more dangerous than an idea, especially when it's the only one you have
You see vision is the art of seeing things invisible
Ahh My God
"To the beat y'all"

[Verse One]
A lot of love lost
Your days is getting cloudy now I'm gonna see how many can really stand the rain
Bumpy back again, analytical
Still working out twice a day like it's critical
Still mix a lot keep it spiritual
Mic still hot still lyrical
And you niggas hate to see me rise
I ain't got no more patience you can see it in my eyes
I'm sick of niggas keeping me in lies
I hear ya talking
I'm New York nigga I rep it every time I step it
Even though I'm well respected
I got a weapon your past is terrible your future's worse
Let me put this Walter PP all in ya mouth cock it and shoot you first
Your shit ain't phat
Ain't no pun to that
Cause I make this hardcore gangsta shit so fun to rap
You in trouble like no gun to clap in the middle of Pakistan
Either you fight or you clap your hand
Cause weak niggas can't ever be sincere
I'm the hardest sober hardcore beats in ya ear
And I'm graceful like Muhammad Ali opposing war
I ain't trying to be no soldier that don't know what he's fighting for
That's hypocritical
If I'm shooting up my block over 1-50 size rocks
I'ma stop
Fucking with niggas like Jenny From The Block
Cause all you want to do is come in the club and bust shots
See a man who exposes himself when he's intoxicated
Really don't know the art of getting drunk
Bumpy Knucks bring funk like a musty black man from Ghana
I rip through MC's like a piranha
Run up on me if ya wanna
I'll cock my resolution like I was Hughey Newton
Plottin revolution
What ya'll rappers call 16 bars I call pollution
So fuck you and your distribution
I'm the self mad dollar
Blue collar
Rottwilder
Yes I weigh more
265 I weigh more
I guess I got my weight up
I send you 16 bars I ate up
All you punch line niggas
I'll put you in a line and punch every one of you
Now you know your purpose
I'm the bible of the ghetto and page by page
I wrote y'all a manual on the black man rage
I'll chase you till I catch that ass I guess I'm like age
And I kill gangsta rappers too I guess I'm like AIDS
Take it easy
Eazy Duz It
And ya'll wanna spit bitch in the club
Being a sleezy buzzit
Two years was my interlude
I fixed my imperfection
I got my mind in better shape to spit you the Konexion

Now that I got that off my Chest

Ayo Big Chuck let's do this for baby bro
