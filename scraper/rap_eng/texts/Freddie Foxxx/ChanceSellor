Haaaaaaaaaaa, yeah!
Come on, ha!
Check it out..

[Verse One: Freddie Foxxx]
How many niggas wanna ride through here with me
If it's some thug shit you on, bring it on baby, come and get me
Come on - huh, Pete Rock, hit me
So I can spit the flame on you niggas so when I die you'll, never forget me
I got underground money that's spent like overground cash
I bust one shot and make you break the fifty yard dash
Underground gon' last, if we remove the virus
Some of the shit I spit'll make you wanna, kill me like Cyrus
Or Martin King from the balcony, don't let me get no alch' in me
Or I be standin in the window with the AK like I got Malc' in me
Who run they mouth at me?
I'll bare foot stomp your ass like I got south in me
Niggas be screaming, they hardcore, but need to be hard more
I lay your gangsta ass out on thee hard floor
Bumpy Knucks keep it real raw
Be in your mouth like I'm the black Mandible claw
I'm someone that you may have all seen be-fore
Maybe in peace or maybe in war; I'm the ChanceSellor

[Verse Two: Freddie Foxxx]
Me and the mic be like Starsky and Hutch
Don't fuck with us, we will roll on you and smoke like you was in a dutch
Ha, such, ludacris ideas
Tryin make Bumpy Knucks dissa-pear
Takin chances tryin to make me show fear
You got a better chance of trying to get some soul outta Britney Spears
I'm arsonistic, quick to release my biscuit
I bitch smack niggas like I'm sadistic
Hear niggas talking 'bout dying - scared to death
Freddie Foxxx in the house, you - scared to breath
I do walk-by's, followed by a bunch of krupt ass niggas that pre-stalk guys
They got hawk eyes, brain clouded with the traumatic
That can make you a calm in the chair, hand on the napalm addict
You niggas don't want no static, cause I have you breathing light - you'se
An asthmatic
Mr. Pataki, your death penalty ain't gon' stop me from watching my
Favorite channel;
Eleven Mackie, shot out the Acy - cause some white boy call me blackie
So we played this little game called click-a-tie clack-a-tie
Now there's three blackies, and we'll dance for ya ..
I'm the ChanceSellor

[Verse Three: Freddie Foxxx]
I'm underground from now, through like 'til death
Even if I end up bein the only real one left
Cause I'm the true black gangsta, real hard papi
Lotta niggas in the game is just real hard copy's
Not build to stop me, if you trying pop me
You probably end up in an morgue, in a six drop three
Got done by the hottest emcee, what that mean is
Overhand rights since Muhammed Ali, slip (POOOOOW!)
For my niggas in the pen, that might never come home again
I'mma keep it sweet for ya, keep it street for ya
And every dime I don't make, I'll take from these wack ass rap niggas
Tunnel bangers we strap niggas, darranger by the asshole
Niggas walking type funny, keep ya eyes pealed for the money
We rob bitches too, so don't run ya mouth honey
I'm i'm distant cousins to genghis khan
I run up in cities and take shit over, that's word is bond
Drama turns me on, a real Afrodiziac
I hear niggas screamin "Yo, where Bump Kneezy at?!"
I'm in the cut, but I can't sit back and watch these rap niggas fuck it up
I'm the ChanceSellor
