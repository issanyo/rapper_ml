[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
Word
Salute to everybody out there
On the grind
Let’s go

Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
To the beat y’all

[Hook]
“Get that ass moving”
“Don’t act stupid”
“Fighting the lost cause”
“Get your life on pause”

[Verse 1: Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo
You had a smile on your face when the baby was born
Me and you became one in that minute
I was in a place where I could touch the sky
So I swore I’ll put everything in it, wow
It’s amazing how your body was a vessel for the blessing
That God called ours and you called mine
And it’s fine just as long as you don’t forget that
I’m a father and I still got to do all mines
I know the 9-month connection is a special little section
Where you and our seed started learning each other
I know the line of respect will be crossed to protect
Out of love for our kids, that’s the trait of a mother
Roadblock on the path to getting my shit right
Slow jams in the midnight thinking ‘bout our big fight
Just don’t use my seed
To feed your emotional greed, please
Let’s rock

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo
Same grind, new focus, new purpose, I’m smiling
You hate this, so here I go again, you’re going in
Regulations on the kid like a rented car
I’m trying to teach him who the winners are, I been a star
Spit a bar, vivid description like cinema
And send love from the battlefield, Benatar
You used to know that, I guess you forgot
‘Cause now you’re going extra hard to keep the beef at the top
Scratch a love and find a foe who you’re sleeping with, you’ll never know
Petty shit in your life becomes ever so
It got you taking it to places I thought you’ll never go
This is a side of you I thought you’ll never show
So, saying that, saying this
I still need to tell you this, bitch
Don’t use my seeds
To feed your emotional greed
Word up

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Yeah
It’s funny how I’m grown, but I learned me another lesson
I should’ve never went unprotected like some suggested
Face full of regret when they ask me the fucking question
Soon as I answer, they ask me another question
It’s personal, it hurts, it got me and my mother stressing
Before that DNA test passed, I wasn’t guessing
Don’t he look just like me, yeah, like some has guessed it
It’s crazy when your public affairs become domestic
And gossiping and telling my story to other exes
Soon as I say it’s a man’s world, I’m fucking sexist
Judge [?] overruled with some objected
With no lawyer, got an A for my mother’s effort
A tough situation I conquered where none perfected
Was granted for a custody knowing my son a blessing
Word, so now you can’t use my seed
To feed your emotional greed
Breathe

[Hook]
