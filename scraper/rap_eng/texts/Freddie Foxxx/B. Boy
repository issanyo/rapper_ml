[Intro: Tech N9ne]
B. Boys and B. Girls stand up
Down south, midwest, east coast, west coast
Globally, everywhere, yeah!
Tech N9ne now! Let's go!

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (2X)
Swing first, I'mma destroy
You a curse, I'mma B. Boy!
Cherried up, got 'em P'noid
Let the whole world know, I'm a B. Boy!

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I watched Snoop do it, he let that blue flag hang
So watch Scoob do it, I'mma let the brown rag swang
Middle deuce to it, boy that's just a five six thang
Now SOO WOO! WOO! That's how we rep this gang
I ain't new to it, vill I got that bang in my veins
And I'm true to it, all I know is bangin' and 'caine
So get used to it, validation now I'm with Strange
OG villain off the block representer of them flames

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I pledge allegiance to the flag, my united hoods of Damu and trees
I'm certified, around the top banging was so influencing
I made it with my heart, a vendetta, in hopes of unity
And left out a with family, a forty cal and a newer me
Deuce click represent, red rag regiment
Redrum replicants, whips runt recreate
Rest won't recommend, refs don't let you win
Red Rider Warriors we rectify the testament we

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skatterman]
5'10", 235, hell of a left hook
Niggas think the feds came and got me when they got West Crook
A vet, look, pull up stuntin' and get your vet took
Or we could stand mano y mano and get your best whooped
Knuckle up knucklehead, nigga been with this knuckle game
Still fuckin' with Scoob, Kutt and Kali, baby ain't nothin change (STRANGE!)
I ride for em without the paper work, and organize drive-by's that have you and your neighbor hurt
Send a couple down and hey you and your neighbor mercked
Show you I ain't playin' fuck around and knock your neighbor first
It's Skatterman, pussy more than just the verses son
Who you think Tech gonna call to make sure that the dirt get done
Red cap, red shirt, red shoe strings
My .45 is a bitch, and I think she havin' mood swings (mood swings?)
You think them boys got guns watch what your dude bring
Fully auto AR-15, wipe out the Blue Team!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Beats bangin' better bring it big or bounce bitch
'Bout to blast it in blood I'm back in this black brick
Boss balla, been breakin' bread 'n baguettes brie
And beautiful biancas, bideos, and Begas with big B
Bow been for brilliance, stressed to be buildin' it
Best in this barrio bane and bazaar be more bills in this
Bankin' his babies be blingin' and his boo be that big booty!
Big bust! Be in his Benzo bronze and get big bucks!
I'm a black baboon, bring me bags of bananas
Bona fide, billy bad ass with a brown bandana
Been gone on Bacardi 'bou Lou but I'm 'bout to be bigger bent
Better break if you bustin' before I'm blown and belligerent
Six deuce brims biggin' it, I'm bloated than Blimpy
Broads be blowin' me in the back of the black Bentley
Never been about no babblin' not bringing no bootsy
But I've been in the bay with big bond like shaboobalaboopy!

[Verse 5: Bumpy Knuckles]
Yo it's the OG Bumpy Knucks, Knucks I rolls with them B. Boys
B' walkin' round strapped up-up
You can talk that killer shit if you want my niggas, spit it
Guarantee that you'll get clapped up-up
See I'm the beast, you the bitch, I'm better battling baby
Me and the blood Tech Nina saddled up-up
And for the record nigga, check mines and you will find
That I shoot legendary status niggas up-up
Come on, to be like Bump ya gotta be a big ball breaker (Pow!)
Crack a nigga whole rack I'm like a jaw breaker (Crack!)
Knock you out and and hit them pockets like a cold hand
I'll bust your motherfuckin' shit and I'm an old man
They said my music was Strange until I made
Me sum change and now they ridin' my nuts-nuts
Tech N9ne's out the window, you see them
KC Killers ridin' by y'all niggas better duck-duck!
Come on!
