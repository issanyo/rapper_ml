[Caz ad lib]

Yea baby
Once again it's the grandest of them all
Even your momma fall for Grand Master Caz
A.K.A. the reason why niggas know you
I'm in this spizzle with my dog P. Lee
We at it again

[Verse One]

You ain't no friend of mine
You ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't tell the people that you lying
You do it all the time
Can't cut or write a rhyme
You smoking hizzle by the twenties and you buying dimes
The shorty's so fine
But she ain't yours she mine
So step back
Get your ass in back of the line
There might have been a time
When you was in your prime
And had a fan or two
But that was back in seven-nine
I know you wanna shine
I see you trying to climb
You was until your ass was home the whole time
Now if you think I'm lying
Go 'head and press rewind
On your career and you will see
Ain't nothing to find

[Chorus]

You say you a pioneer
But you didn't invent nothing
Call you a lioneer cause you never meant nothing
When I was rocking Harlem World
You was on the block frontin'
You been hatin' for a long time
You got nothin'
You say you a pioneer
But nobody knows you
Just let you know the real
Don't think we won't expose you
People take our pictures and
[?]
[?]

[Verse Two]

Damn homie
You ain't gone never gonna be the man homie
Fuck is wrong with you
I got a hip-hop vendetta
We ain't gonna talk about cheddar
When i step in the spot
They all on me like a sweater
Now I know you know better
I'm pitching a double header
Got two chicks at the bar
And you got one an they fatter
And she hungry
And she ain't no [?] Tonya Anneta
You need to leave her alone, son
And get it together
Be easy
Start some bullshit
It won't be no battling
Don't need to take it to the street
Because your dad will win
The pack is in the club
And you'll get thrown out
So sit your monkey ass down 'for you get blown out

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]

Yo
I ain't no mobster
I ain't no gangster
I ain't no hit
Man, I'm just G.M.C
Yes, I'm an Icon
My fuckin' mic on
And it's me you see on BET
I'm a cut your baby
Yea I made it easy
For you niggas to eat
Now your raps is cheesy
By any means, partner
I got fans to feed
Get in the way of that
You won't have no fam to feed
Niggas sayin' they fucking with the general
How?
You couldn't do that if you were standing up here now
What you know about hip-hop and icon status?
Not a mother fucking thing
Ya'll niggas want it?
Get at us

[Chorus]
