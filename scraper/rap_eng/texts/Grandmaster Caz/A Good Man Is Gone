[Verse 1]
Niggas like to bust, it's just another night to us
But don't nobody win when a good man bite the dust
He wasn't black or white to us
He could have been your enemy but the cat was alright to us
He even got tight with us, sometimes he used to light with us
We had beef, he'd fight with us
He didn't even like to 'cuss, but he wasn't to tight to bust
Till somebody bust back, all [?]
And splatter that kid's brain all over the park
He's a rat, another [?] who wasn't hear that long
And now a good man is gone

[Hook]
"What ended his life
A man with his gun
And now wonder what he would say.. If he were here today"

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing happy but a good man buying a farm
Ain't nothing nice when you can't solve a crying mom
Ain't nothing cool, a brother killed by one of his own
Ain't nothing right, a good man is gone
And you can cry, I know you gotta a lot of tears
Cause this guy you know for a lot of years
And you wish you could bring him back somehow
But can't nobody help with now
All you can do is remember how he used to smile
And make sure the cat who did it don't make it to trial
And do the best you can to look out for his child
Get in his shoes, and walk a mile

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He could have been the next Malcolm or Marcus Garvey
But somebody had to go out just like Lee Harvey
And strike a brother down in his prime
They're ain't no telling what he could have done giving the time
He could have been the next pres, win a Nobel Prize
Could have been somebody famous or one of the guys
Could have been a leader, that would have changed that course
Could have get five mics in the Source
He could have done great things, and find a cure for cancer
To life's questions, he might have had the answers
But I guess we'll never know, cause a gun was drawn
Now another good man is gone
