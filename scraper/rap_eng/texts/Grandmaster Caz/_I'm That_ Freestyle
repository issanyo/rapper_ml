I be that stage nigga
I don't know how to age, nigga
I'm the first cat to put the pen to the page, nigga
I'm the key to the cage nigga
That brown and beige nigga
I'm the off-the-chain, I'm the off the chain meat-rack meter and gauge Nigga engage nigga
I'm that top nigga
Walk through your hood with a bop, nigga
No drop nigga
But I hang out and run from the cop, nigga
Hip-hop, nigga!
I used to run with yo pop, nigga
Yo, I thought I told you that I won't stop, nigga
The mic nigga
MCing's like riding a bike nigga
I'm the beige Timbaland and the white air Nike nigga
I'm the rhyme nigga
The "let's go back into time" nigga
The prime nigga!
That always keeping my dime nigga
I'm the sixth nigga
I'd rather flip flows than bricks nigga
I shoulda been long gone, but I'm still in the mix, nigga!
I'm the live nigga
Always last to arrive nigga
I'm the Cross Bronx-westside-FDR Drive nigga
I'm that hood nigga
I smoke that good wood, nigga
You could never fuck with
But wish that you could, nigga
I'm that damn nigga
That "fuck you and your man" nigga
That "get yo punk ass in the back of the van" nigga
I'm that sweet nigga
That never off-beat nigga
That circle and a slash on cold mics
Heat, nigga!
I'm that cool nigga
Ran my whole high school nigga
And you don't want to ever challenge me to a duel, nigga
I'm that proud nigga
That stand out in the crowd nigga
The "go where most of yall niggas ain't allowed" nigga
I'm that smart nigga
Always first to start nigga
I think with my head, but I feel with my heart, nigga!
