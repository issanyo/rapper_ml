You got beef, bring it with talk, ain't no need for violence
There's already too many men in the moment of silence
Too many with handkerchiefs, too many wreaths
Because there's not enough indians and too many chiefs
Cause there's, too many tears, and too many sides
Too many "we gonna miss him"s, and too many goodbyes
Too many flowers for baskets, too many caskets
Cause there's, too many shootings, and not enough ass kicks
Yeah, too many gangsters, and too many thugs
Too many G's too many hoods, and too many drugs
Too many Mac-10's, too many Tecs and .38's
Not enough food, on too many plates
Too many Tony Montanas pushin a Lexus
Not enough Medgar Evers, or Malcolm X's
Too many brothers locked, in institutions
Yeah, too many problems, and no solutions
Too much, for too many people
In the thought we was all created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel
There's, too many enemies, not too many friends
Too many poor people, without too many ends
Too many politicians runnin, with too many crooks
Too many kids in one classroom, and no books
Too many broken promises, and too many lies
Too many girls buyin dreams, from too many guys
Too many young black brothers doin too many bids
Too many single black mothers raisin too many kids, alone
Too much sicknesses and too much disease
Too many genocidal blacks, too many degrees of seperation
Causin too much strife
Too many things known in the ghetto that can take your life
It's too much, for too many people
In the thought we was all created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel
There's, too much pop and not enough soul
Too many things we create but we don't control
Too many people walkin round, with not enough hope
Too much crack, and way too much DOPE
Too many fathers not around, to raise their children
Too many empty lots and abandoned buildings
Too many jails bein built and not enough schools
Too many rappers ain't droppin no jewels!
Too much negativity, in the things we say
And not enough about showin us a better way
Too many young black soldiers, in too many graves
Too many of us still thinkin like slaves!
Time to break the chains and the ties that bind
And elevate ourselves to a, greater state of mind
Set some positive examples for the youth!
Teach them well so they know the truth, cause now
It's too much, for too many people
In the thought we was all, created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel
Too much, for too many people
In the thought we was all, created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel!
