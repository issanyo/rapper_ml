The following record will not be heard so that we may bring you this special report

[Sammy Ad lib]

Sha-boing-boing
Hey you cats this is me, Sammy
And I'm here with my man
One of the most happening cats
In hip-hop history, man
I mean Grand Master Caz
You know what I mean
Hey Caz
I hear you're doing a record
Because that guy, Big Bank ripped off your rhyme for "Rappers Delight"
I'm with ya, babe
Let'em have it

[Verse One]

I'll break your hip
Make you hop
To the hippy hospital
Ya slip
Make you stop
Crash your crib
[?]
Cha-bang with a bang
Cause Mark is picking boogies
Spinning rhythm while you boogie to beat
You like what you hear
This is not a test
I'm emceeing to the beat
And me, myself and I
Ain't got to try to move your feet
It's automatic
See I am Grand Master Caz
And I'd like to say hello
To the kids
To Heather and Jeron
To Mel, Julie Brown
Bianca, Michael and Mojo
My kids Ain't gotta
Gang bang
To boogie witcha booty
Cause Pops makes ya boogie
To the gang bang boogie
Let's rock
And don't stop
Cause I'm the nigga that'll make your party rock
Well so far I know you like my voice
I didn't bring no friends along
I can handle this one all by myself
Now, hear the way some things go on
Ya heard me?

[Chorus]

Grandmaster, Grandmaster
I'm the Grandmaster with the three emcees
Grandmaster, Grandmaster
Who put this thing together?
Me, that's who
Grandmaster, Grandmaster
I'm the Grandmaster with the three emcees
Grandmaster, Grandmaster
Who put this thing together?
Me, that's who

[Verse Two]

I'm the C-a-s-n the o-v-a
And the rest is f-l-y
The cat who bit this rhyme was my manager
Pure treason
I'll tell ya why
Cause he's six foot one
Two tons of bum
And can't dress to a tee
He ain't got no clothes, much less no hoes
And ain't even no emcee
No body guards and no two cars
A Lincoln and a Cadillac
He sung about it in song
Well, them shits is gone
And my money probably paid for that
See
When I was in high school
He did some shit uncool
That was really off the wall
He made a deal with the Sugar Hill Gang to rap
And weeks later gave me a call
He said, I need some rhymes to rock off "Good Times"
I said, Why? You ain't no emcee
He said these people in Jersey got two for the game
They need a third so they picked me
I gave it to him thinking
Check books, credit cards, more money
Then a sucker could ever spend
But he never gave a nigga a god damn dime
And was supposed to be my friend
It ain't over though

[Chorus]

I ain't know what to do
I ain't know I could sue
Cause nobody ever told me so
And I pretty much put the thing out of my mind
Until I heard it on the radio
Had every station playing
Hip hop to the hippy, to the hippy
People running up to me on the street
Saying we heard your rhymes on the radio
They robbed you and that "Good Times" beat
Now would have been all right
Had I copyright
[?] Or lawyer knew my steez
So I deaded Big Bank
Forgot "Rappers Delight"
And did what I had to do for me
I been known to flip a bird
Twenty four is preferred
I write'em word for word
Taken shaken
Not stirred
Not first or third
But at the head of the heard
Like a bull in a China shop
Every line I drop
Hit like a brick
With mad bass in it
I'm one of the facts so start facing it
Parker gave me the track and I'm lacing it
If my shit's wack I'm erasing it
Replacing it
With something hotter
Because a lot of
[?] Cats from lat to Bambaataa
[?] Jay-Z to Dota
Rock is listening
So we gotta be roll
Gotta be more
If it's Cold Crush
Then it's gotta be four
Grandmaster with the three emcees
Peace to all the wanna be G emcees
I'm looking for thee only emcees
Who keep it real
And still write their rhymes
Ya heard
It was a while ago
But I couldn't let go
Until I've had my say
And as for me
I'm company VP
Jazz Child
Single on the way
Ya heard
Still bad
Lethal with a pen and a pad
Ain't nothing change as God as my witness
Except for the fact it ain't personal no more
It's strictly business
Cause I'm the

[Chorus]
