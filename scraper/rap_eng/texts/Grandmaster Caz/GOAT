[Verse 1: Grandmaster Caz]
Before rap was a game or Hip-Hop was a nation
Before Lauren Hill began her miseducation
Before Milk was chillin' or PE brought the noise
Before Heavy D and the Boyz
Before the roof caught on fire, Before fresh was the word
Before Whodini and friends and Roxanne’s Revenge
Before the freaks came out at night, before say Ho
Before the Crash Crew was rocking on the radio
Before Whitney, Mariah and J-Lo and Janet
Before Bam and the Soulsonic Force rocked the planet
Before “These Are The Breaks”, before Hard Times
Before the Sugarhill Gang, and Before Super Rhymes
Before Reaganomics, before rappers got shot in their stomachs
Before you found Hip-Hop in comics
Before G’s, before weed was trees
Before going raw dog gave you a deadly disease
Before haters, before thugs and perpetrators
Before the alphas and before the betas
Before beepers and cell phones and retro gods
And fed ex, food stamps and metro cards
Before cops was 5-0 or gats was answers
Before all the B-Boys turned in to break dancers
Before Legs was crazy or out turned to swazey
Back when my man said it’s hot, humid and hazy…..
Before all the bull and by no means get it twisted
My name is Hip-Hop and I have always existed
