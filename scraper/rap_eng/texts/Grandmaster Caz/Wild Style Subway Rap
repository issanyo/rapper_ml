South Bronx, New York, what do I see?
Kids growing up in the community

[Dialogue]
Hey Caz, look at those kids over there, check 'em out
I hear you Charlie [?]
You know those kids now are the grown-ups of tomorrow
They're the future
I hear that, I know where you're comin' from
That's what I'm talkin' about

Streets are filthy, crime is high
People look suspicious when you walk by
No smiles or grins as the city sins
When it comes to violence, nobody wins

[Dialogue]
Man, look how dirty everything is man
I hear that, look at that
I hate this part of the area
It's not like that everywhere, but
I just hate to see...
Terrible

Look past the garbage, over the trains
Under the ruins, through the remains
Around the crime and pollution
And tell me, where do I fit in?
South Bronx, New York that's where I dwell
To a lot of people it's a living hell
Full of frustration and poverty
But wait, that's not how it looks to me
It's a challenge and opportunity
To rise above the stink and debris
Got to start with nothing and then you built
Follow your dream until it's fulfilled!

[Dialogue]
Yo I can make that Charlie, you know by following your dream
'Cause I got a dream and that's to be number one and I'm gonna follow mine
Well, my dream is the same as yours man I wanna be up there
You know, we all have our dreams

I'm a warrior, my art is my sword
A place in society is my reward
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Success is something we all want to taste
Everyone has a talent on the earth
And you can take it or leave it for what it's worth
No matter how hard things may seem
You've got the potential, fulfill your dream
We're the future, it's up to us
To make our home rate an "A plus"
Let your mind be pure and free to create
Then use the beat in your heart and aim to be great!

[Dialogue]
Word that's what it about man
I'm gonna do my thing and don't let nothing else hold me back
You know, just strive to be number one always
That's the same thing I told my little brother
He said he wanted to drop out of school
I had to tell man, you know
You gotta push, push, that's what it's all about man
