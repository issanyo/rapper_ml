[Caz ad lib]

[Verse One]

I'm going back to the scene of the rhyme
Where I left off
Memories of emcees that I swept off
The microphone
With a brief, swift motion
Hit'em, with a dose and my potion was so sensational
In fact, it worked like a charm
My raps is on cue
My beats is bombs
Therefore you got a snowball in hell's chance to get with me
When you run up on me again
S.O.S the same old shit
Strange or somethings stay the same
Somethings change
But one thing remains unbending
The rhymes I'm sending
Stored in my very own vending machine
Look through the glass
Rhymes stacked from A to Z
By Grand Master Caz
Fresh as a new born baby son
You know what
You got to pay to hear one
To damn quiet and rap needs handling
And I need a rush
Not dope, some adrenaline
And that's why I got to go back to claim what's mine
I'm going back to the scene of the rhyme

[Chorus]

Going back to the scene of the rhyme
I'm going back to the scene of the rhyme
Yea
I'm going back, going back to the scene of the rhyme
I'm going back to the scene of the rhyme
Yea son
I'm going back, going back to the scene of the rhyme
I'm going back to the scene of the rhyme
Uh-huh
I'm going back, going back to the scene of the rhyme
I'm going back to the scene of the rhyme

[Verse Two]

Going back to where game was shot like an archer
And ain't been the same since my departure
Where rap's royalties sat at one round table like kings
Running things
But if you was wack the big boys would dis you
Back when white clouds was inside tissues
Before the new flav took the whole world by storm
Yo, we had it going on
Hip-hop clubs that sold forties of Old E
Nine to seven 'o clock in the mourning
Now somebody show me
Where you can go and swing with your crew
Anywhere past two
Not in the streets cause there's to much crime there
That's why I'm going back to the scene of the rhyme where
A battle was fought man to man
Where the beats are real steel
But no caps got peeled
Casualties where somebody got hung
On rap
Suicide when a brother got his bell rung
Stung like a bee
Or buried alive in a coffin
Yea, I took them out often
To soften the blows, I gave them all a warning
Don't fuck with the bros and the town we was born in
Sworn in like a judge
To uphold the test of time
I'm going back to the scene of the rhyme

[Chorus]

I dedicate this song to all my true hip-hop niggas
You know what I'm saying
Who gave blood, sweat and tears to the hip-hop game
To only get a door closed up in they face
You know what I mean?
Ya'll let that shit marinate
