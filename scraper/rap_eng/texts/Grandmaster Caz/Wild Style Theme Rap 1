[Intro]
Take to the street, with the wildstyle beat
Rock the town, with the wildstyle sound
Enter the gate, to the wildstyle state
Shock the nation with the wildstyle sensation

[Verse 1]
Before rapper or MC was a household word
DJ cuts is all that was heard
All the funky beats, that used to play
Made everybody want to be a DJ
A funny thing happened in New York streets
Rhymes were being said, along with the beats
Now things are turned around, and it appears to be
Everybody wants to rap, or be an MC

[Verse 2]
From the street came art, very new, you see
Not seen in a museum or gallery
Not hung in mansions, or stages hung
But on busses, trains, even the walls
Graffitiâ€‹, ghetto art, or tagging your name
The artist's way of reaching for fame
Shunned by the public, like a lightning storm
Now recognized, as a new art form

[Verse 3]
The hustle for couples, the smurfette, too
Breakdance is whatever you want to
A combination of ballet, and acrobatics
Practice is what makes you good at it
Turns, flips, spinning on the floor
B-Boys against each other, competition is sure
We won't bore you, with an explanation
Just sit back and let us give you, a demonstration
