I said I've been down with this since the start of Rap
I guess you could say I played a big part of Rap
Not only been the brain, but the heart of Rap
And it beats just like a drum, and that's the art of rap
I've been known to flip flows like bricks and pancakes
And, yeah, I seen my share of tricks and handshakes
By tricks and bandmates with a different agenda
Female and male snakes and some great pretenders
But trust me on this, for as long as i'm breathing
I'm gonna check a wet rapper, and call out a heathen
I'm gonna lead by example, with this hot shit I'm spitting
And, y'all just saw me write me, so you damn right it's written
That's part of the art of rap, in 20 minutes flat
Write a rhyme in real time, and I was fucking with that
So you can fall back from that old cat, don't get it twisted
The MC train just left the station, and I was driving, you missed it
