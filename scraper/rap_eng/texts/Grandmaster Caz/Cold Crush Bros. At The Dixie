By this tough voice, all the ladies can tell
The man on the mic (the L, the L)
The heart (the breaker), the heart (the breaker)
On any stage, I'm the number one player
Do it like this and you will see
Nobody in the place can play like me
'Cause I'm the L (baby, baby)
The L (baby, baby)
The one who rocks you all swell (baby, baby)
Well it's '82 and everything is fine
But I still gotta thought in my mind
That do you still listen to an MC rhyme?
Well if you do (well I bet you do)
Gotta lotta them rough [?] come through
And if you still got money and you wanna bet
Well I'll bet a hundred dollars I'm not whipped yet
'Cause I'm the L, L, L, the one who rocks so well
Sending all the fly girls to the hotel
So A.D. (ha ha), A.D. (ha ha)
A.D. (ha ha), A.D. (ha ha)
A.D. (ha hoo) my golden son
Homeboy, get on the mic with your rhymes galore

My goal is the same, I aim for fame
I don't pop no game (he don't have no tame)
Never put to shame because I have a brain
Supreme Easy A.D. is a [?] name
Never brag about my crew but you know what we can do
Don't have no L.P., but we're not blue
Our rhymes [?] set the mood
If you won't bother us we won't bother you
We're the Cold Crush crew, that's what I said
All you wack MCs get it through your heads
As you listen to me speak as I reach my peak
Because we never find a rhyme I know [?] repeat
Because I'm Easy [?], going all the way
Keeping up the funky pace [?]
And then you get up, then ya get up
And rock, rock to the crowd, rock, rock to the beat

You rock to the beat 'cause I'm so sweet
I guarantee to rock the house to get ya out alla-laaba-laaba
Supreme A.D. as you suggest
Rockin' to the funky beat I'm the serious [?]
I'm down with the four, I'm down with the four
I'm down with the four known as the Cold Crush
The Cold Crush crew (the what)
The Cold Crush crew (say what!)
Guaranteed to get the party people in the mood (say what!)
Cold Crush crew got nothin' to prove
But rock the house for you and you
And [?] ha ha down by law

Ha-hoo I throw this off

Get on the mic with your rhymes galore
Yes yes y'all (yes yes y'all)

You do it up until you get on down
'Cause the Cold Crush four is in your town
Well I'm the K, the K, the K, the K
And don't forget the A rock to the beat
To the break of day
And rock to the beat and listen to what I say
Walkin' down the street and I met this girl
Told the girl what it's gonna be
Let's go to my house and community
Then I hit her with the rap it was so bad
I took the girl up to my pad
Got home she start bustin' on through
I took to myself I know this can't be
The girl turned around and this [?] (down by law)
Well it was some kind of [?]
She said baby be calm, (she said) baby be cool
Let me teach you the golden rule
But yes my mellow do y'know what I said? (What?)
Laid her monkey ass (what!), shoved her monkey ass (what!)
Through her monkey ass in my waterbed
I said Caz (down by law)
My mell-ow, get on the mic and serve 'em well

It was a long time ago but I'll never forget
I got caught in the bed with a girl named Yvette
Well I was scared like hell but I got away
That's why I'm here tellin' you today
I was outside of my school [?] rock
A crowd of people all around listenin' to my box
Just me and the fans, and some guys from my crew
Chillin' hard 'cause we had nothin' better to do
It was me, the L, the A, and the Rl
And then I slipped away to make a phone call
To this very day it was a move I regret
But I didn't know then so I called Yvette
I said, "Hello pretty mama, it's your lover man"
She said, "Baby, come on over as quick as you can"
I said, "I can't come now, someone's comin' to get me"
Then she said, "I'm all alone, there's nobody with me"
Thought for a second, 'Oh shit, she's alone!'
Then I was knockin' at her door before she hung up the phone
She let me in the house and gave me a kiss
And said, "Give me that thing that you know I miss"
So we went into her room and we got high
But she couldn't keep her hand from off my fly
So I made her lock the door, went to check it
When I came back in the girl was naked
That was my cue to do the do
I took my clothes off and started on the prove
Well I was tearin' shit up, and 'bout a quarter to three
She said, "Caz! Somebody's comin'!"
I said, "Yeah, me!"
Then the door bust open, and there was her folks
I thought, 'Damn, they coulda waited - said damn, they coulda waited, said damn, they coulda waited 'til I finished my stroke
Her mother was in shock, her father reached on the shelf
Pulled down the .45, I almost shit on myself!
Said, "Please don't shoot!" and pleaded my case
Said, "You'd have done the same thing if you was in my place
But if you spare my life, believe me friend!
You'll never see me 'round your daughter again"
Don't ask me why but he let me leave
I ran twenty-six blocks, then I stopped to breathe
Gave thanks to God he wasn't too upset
Went home and thought about poor Yvette
He must of beat her ass with everything I assume
'Cause I could hear the girl screamin' all the way in my room
Even though I don't see Yvette no more
Well I know she ain't as fine, I know she ain't as fine
I know [?] as she was before
So J.D.L. ha, yeah my voice is sore
Get on the mic and rock once more

Well I'm here to be known and I'm known to be
As an electrifying prince of poetry
You listen to my rhymes that you never ever heard
So stick around...
