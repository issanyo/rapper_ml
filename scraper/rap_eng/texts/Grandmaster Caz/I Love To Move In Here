I love to move here
(Woo)
I love to move in here

[Verse - Grandmaster Caz]
Okay
This is how its going to go
You'all going to move untill you can't no more
The DJ going to pick up records untill his hands are sore
The lights are going to flash
For Grandmaster Caz
Going to kick it to you like you never heard before
The place is here
The time is now
All the fellas say "ho"
All the ladies say "ow"
Put your two hands together
To form a soul clap
And jump back never see you ride the track
It isn't black or white
It's about the beat
If you can't rack the mic
Its about the heat
You say what you're like
When I'm about to speak
And nobody want to hear you anyway
So keep it moving girl (girl)
So old skool taking it back
And we aren't leaving
Till we stop breathing
Even if the music stops
We continue to groove
Nice and smooth
Because we want y'all to move

[Hook] [x2]
I love to move here
(Woo)
I love to move in here
