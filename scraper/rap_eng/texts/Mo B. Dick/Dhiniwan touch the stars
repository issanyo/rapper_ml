My songline criss cross from coast to coast
Stories of my culture that we holding close
This the black soil plains where the songline start
The story of my people, Dhinawan up in the stars

This a – call out from the north to west
And if you know the emu dreaming yarn y’all connected
To the – black dirt that’s beneath ya feet
Coming fresh outta Walgett where the two rivers meet

Couple cods and a yellowbelly – couple Johnny cakes
Have a yarn to Aunty. Bit of conversation
This how we do it in kamileroi nation
Throw ya dubs up, reppin all of my relations

You can feel it round the campfire light
You can hear the clapsticks when you close your eyes
Get ya friends and ya family and hold them tight
Stay strong we gonna be alright

My country where the songlines are
Where dhinawan touch the stars
Sunset see the red light glow
My heart beats to get back home

My country where the songlines are
Where dhinawan touch the stars
Sunset see the red light glow
My heart beats to get back home

We dealing with the kinda stuff that’ll get ya down
That stuff what ya do when ya bored livin in a small town
That sadness is all around us
Yep trauma & pain gets passed down cuz

Copy what ya mum & dad does and what ya brothers do
Yep it’s my family and my friends that I look up to –
Shapes my values - makes me who I am
Black superwoman or black superman

Black fella spray paint on the back of your right hand
Used to hold a spear now ya holdin a mic stand
Used to follow lore now ya follow the white man
Used to read stars now we follow the nav man, a black man

Gotta read the signs ahead – choose the right path
Got young fullas lookin up to you bred
Watching your every step, every path you tread
Every choice you make you better make it your best

My country where the songlines are
Where dhinawan touch the stars
Sunset see the red light glow
My heart beats to get back home

My country where the songlines are
Where dhinawan touch the stars
Sunset see the red light glow
My heart beats to get back home

This is our time, it’s time to make a choice
This a song for my people, stand up and raise your voice
This a message and it’s special for the little girls and boys
Speak the truth, be fair dinkum and make some noise

Pull yourself out of the drain, get up out of the gutter
Continue the story of your great great barji and ya darthar
Show the love and respect one another
Don’t let it go in one ear and out the other
Love ya my dhagaan
Love ya my brother
