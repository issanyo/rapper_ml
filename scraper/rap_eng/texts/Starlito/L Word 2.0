[Intro]
Lito
The L word gotta show me how
My long lost love, love life, live large
Liberate, lead, look, listen, learn

[Verse 1]
Long talks with my granny, realize how really she complain
Lost in this music, keep me from getting buried in my pain
Love yourself, never think less, but arrogance is lame
Love yourself but how you gon' love me? I'm aware I never change
Life lessons got me meditating, still never hesitating
Live in the moment, I leveled up, yeah I elevated
Large scale, I'm heavy, nah I never needed my hand held
Liberate your mind, stop lying to your damn self
Leave if you have to, grieve 'cause it's past due
Please dude, relax
Breathe, this gon' pass too
Listen to your heart, look inside your soul, that's you
Learn to never stop learning, enjoy your journey, you can laugh too

[Chorus]
If I'ma take an L just let it be love
If I'ma take an L just let it be love
If I'ma take an L, if I'ma take an L
You can't love nobody else until you learn to love yourself
If I'ma take an L just let it be love
If I'ma take an L just let it be love
If I'ma take an L, if I'ma take an L
You can't love nobody else until you learn to love yourself

[Verse 2]
Live from the kitchen table, life stories ain't no fable
Lunch tables to a record label, everybody ain't able
Leave a legendary legacy and stack it up like Legos
Send L a letter later to tell 'em I elevated
Left them haters, let 'em say whatever, I already let 'em betray me
I'm a legend, thought this since eleventh grade, but I never cared to be famous
You live, you learn, you can't change it
I love my life, you can't blame me
'Bout to lose your lease from late payments 'cause you gotta live a lie and maintain it
I just did a lecture, I ain't no professor
I kept it respectful and professional
I just got a blessing, apology from a white detective nicely
'Cause he forgot to see if I was licensed for my weapon
He said sorry, I accepted, look

[Chorus]
If I'ma take an L just let it be love
If I'ma take an L just let it be love
If I'ma take an L, if I'ma take an L
You can't love nobody else until you learn to love yourself
If I'ma take an L just let it be love
If I'ma take an L just let it be love
If I'ma take an L, if I'ma take an L
You can't love nobody else until you learn to love yourself
