[Intro: Starlito]
Shit
Introversion
Hood Rich

[Verse 1: Starlito]
It's a thin line between joy and pain
Momma smiling, the sun shining but I'm enjoying the rain
Drowning my sorrows by pouring up drank
Down on myself with no one to complain to
Getting this change but I'm going insane too
Cause' everyone changed even though I'm the same dude
Throw em' some change if you don't they gonna blame you
Never wanted the fame cause' I know what the fame do
The game cruel, all my comrades confined
I prefer solitude I'm out my mind half the time
Drug habit gravity defined, still a survivor turned tragedy to triumph
Made the most out the least and flipped the ten fold
Spoke to the code of the streets seen many men fold
Money got long so I got extendos
She wants to know whats wrong, I'm about to implode

[Chorus: Robin Raynelle
Feel like somethings different, whats wrong
Tell me Why you never pick up the phone
Maybe I should leave you alone
And let you work it out on your own

[Verse 2: Starlito
Keep reading my partners paperwork over and over
Just poured a four in my soda
Now I ain't know when it's over
Late nights from a lonely day and you got no one to hold ya
Now its time to go hit the stage I'm trying to hold my composure
So throwed did my last show with a toaster
All the ups and the downs I'm rolling I'm coasting I'm loaded but I'm focused yeah
Don't know if you know this but I don't know who gonna be there
When the going gets tough I'm the one who ain't going no where
Dolo blowing dro in the air , well you know how I go anywhere
Man I be trying tell these young niggas
Try to live my rhymes you gonna wind up in a  chair
I just hope you don't die from kidney failure
I just know you gonna hold down your niggas forever

[Chorus]
