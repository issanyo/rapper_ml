[Verse1: Starlito]
The bookie owe me a grand
I sent that shit to my man
I left some Niggas behind they couldn't get with the plan
I was dead ass serious I guess them Niggas was playing
Take for a Nigga to diss em to for em to hear what I'm sayin
Well right Where I stand
I'm hollering Fuck this war killer
Used to be my Nigga
Lookin at my picture
Hard on that Nigga in the mirror like look at ya
Fuck around and get yourself killed such a good rapper
Worried bout these pussy ass Niggas that shouldn't matter
Scared to have a Lil one if they kill ya who gone look after him
My mind gone in my own zone like Bun said
Two in a one liter one in the whole one in the head
Just get a blunt and some head I'm good for a hour
Then I kick that bitch out before I get in the shower
Trap phone blowing up it couldn't be louder
Saying he Just hit a lick guessing he took it for power
Yea a free brick and a half it changed his life he was stunting
But once a robber always month later he selling dummies
That mean it look Right wrapped up white like a mummy
Type a Nigga that smile in yo eyes with counterfeit money
Told em a low number they caught him for twenty
Pulled up to serve em they pulled up dumping





[Verse 2: Starlito]
Five murders one week one mile radius
Now it's going down they young wild and dangerous
Claiming that claiming this
Fuck with me and all you get is flaming hot Hollow Tips
The same kind as cheeto chips
Swerve up and we don't miss
See them and squeeze that's it
No time to think bout shit but fleeing and fingerprints
That's Why I stay to myself and stay high on that weed shit
These Niggas don't believe in shit
Believe it or not we at risk
