[Intro: Starlito]
I wasn't wrong
But I can't move on, yeah
I put my heart in my pocket, that's only part of the problem
Cuss her out tonight and then call her tomorrow
Lito

[Verse 1: Starlito]
I apologize, yeah I'm sorry you doubted me
Since we parted ways, I've been going harder without you
We agreed to let it go, so why are we arguing about it?
I put my heart in my pocket, that's only part of my problem
I came up crooked and foolish, it all started in projects
To really pullin' up shooting, like James Harden with them rockets
I don't start just to stop, so I'ma give it all that I got
Sometimes I wonder, would you want me if I was balling or not?
I wonder who gon' really ride for me when all this shit stop
It's 'bout the time I move my money to a whole 'nother spot
Fuck it I'm going all in, you probably fold for the flop

[Chorus: B-Rad]
Girl you said you'd be there for me
So I'm not wrong, when I move on
Girl you said you'd be there for me
So I'm not wrong, when I move on

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I just rap 'cause this shit therapeutic
I survived a fucking scary movie
I ain't guilty of what they accusing
I watched the news and my life feel like it's their amusement
Either way I lose, so I put that shit all in my music
Then I come home and bring up shit I ain't got shit to do with
Look I can't tell who really with me and it get confusing, I'm disillusioned
You live and you learn, I'm just a student, but I come to this conclusion

[Chorus: B-Rad]
Girl you said you'd be there for me
So I'm not wrong, when I move on
Girl you said you'd be there for me
So I'm not wrong, when I move on

[Outro]
I don't know if we each have a destiny or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze
But I think maybe it's both
