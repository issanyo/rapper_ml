[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Two percent on my window
Nosey nigga quit peeking
Rap nigga can’t get a verse from Trip
Now a nigga swear we beefin’
Broke ass nigga go get some money
Then we can schedule a meeting
Sorry I’m at the office for the weekend
Get back to you when I feel it’s convenient
Please hop off of my gonads
My niggas riders, no mopeds
It’s so sad if you die over that shit you wrote in your notepad
All I wanted was a piece of mind
But the rent was due and the lights was out
Mama broke, sound like I gotta go and get it
Either fight or bow
I don’t expect for you sheltered ass to ever comprehend this life of ours
Dirty money, no handouts, I’m from the bottom, I’m flying proud
I named my chopper after Mickey Mouse
If you don’t get it take a wild guess
I’m the seventh letter out the alphabet
And my only fear is the IRS
Godspeed

[Hook: Young Dolph]
All I ever wanted was a couple mil
All I ever wanted was a down bitch
All I ever wanted was a foreign car
All I ever wanted is to get rich
All I ever wanted is to keep it solid
25 bands in my left pocket
Got another 35 in my right pocket
Four or five in my bitch closet

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I just left up out the bank now everybody so nice to me
Seem like yesterday police was reading my rights to me
All I ever wanted was a bitch that wouldn’t lie to me
Keep an extra pistol in her purse and will fight for me
I know niggas that’ll kill for me, ones that’ll die for me
That’s why I’m always solo with that thirty and my forty
Bring my zips down to five quarters, I’m just tryna avoid a charge
I stay grinding and going hard, put my mama in that foreign car
All I wanted was to buy my own and not get fronted
If you see me in the club that mean I got my gun in
I’m in this Sprinter in your city with them choppers on me
80-20 split for me, 360’s not 100
I don’t want it

[Hook: Young Dolph]
