[Verse 1]
I don’t want to waste this inspiration
Been so patient anticipating
Going nuts for the change like cashews, cashiers
Cash rules, is that clear?
Gas triple black
Went and tinted the windows on the rental
It got that serious
They tryna make my nigga tat a tear
(They tryna make my nigga..)

Had it to here, put rap in the rear
Went back to trapping trash bags like I ain’t have a career
Who should I fear but the person staring back in the mirror
But I felt worthless cause my shirts wasn’t matching my gear
You niggas weird, what’s worse , you niggas wired
I’m high but at my all time low I get inspired
Nowadays all I know is gettin' mine
I remember I had some dumb ass goals like getting signed

[Hook]
I might've got way too high
Never mind, Imma forever grind
Might've got way to high

[Verse 2]
Mumbling to myself, waking up, blacking out
Thinking I’m by myself, thinking I’m at the house
Blinking, I’m in the cell, when the ink's drying back out
Somebody bring me a lighter I think it just went back out
Money ain’t satisfying me, think I need some adrenaline
When we gone actualize that we ain’t nothing but middlemen
Uncivilized, ain’t used to settling civil suits
You owe me loot, Mr. Schute'll really shoot
(Might've got way to high)
My partner just lost his mama and I don’t know what to tell him
Tell cuz to chill, cause they telling and people been tryna nail him
Hang with a bunch of felons but never been cool with failing
Feel like I’m in my feelings, this pill just kicked in, I feel it
My engineer’s named Kevin, he pull it up I'ma kill it
I might've got way too high
