I don't always do what's best, I confess
Exhibit A, my ex, I rest my case
Tell you the rest yesterday
Starlito's Way, the Free at Last mixtape (alright)
This go around I'm my own boss
Trash Bag Gang bitch and I'm showing off (Grind Hard)
Gotta give it up to dro and soft
My latest yellow broad, I call her misses Know-It-All
Cheating on her man with Mr. Blow-It-All
A.K.A what it cost, I don't wanna talk
Lito fell off, is that what they thought
Now she like, girl let me tell you what this nigga bought
Couple gats and loft, and that thrax kind of expensive
So like a business expense, I tax right off as soon as I get it
Keep that shit so presidential, flow so existential
With a pocket full of dead inventors
Tried to put me up on shit that I'm already into
And if she ain't street smart, that's cool, I'm heavy in her
Mother fuck them pussy niggas that I never mention
Mind on a million, still winning, I ain't petty nigga
Clique to clique, dick riding, you pathetic nigga
You can have that bitch, I already hit her
She got miles like the Chevy nigga
You don't want beef, I'll turn you to a veggie nigga
I'm a Sapien-omnivore
Whose alibi was he's out on tour
Either that or court side watching the Commodores
Bad mother fucker, put that on the condom on the floor
Swisher sweets and a suite with a submissive freak
Them bitches cheap when you get 'em geeked
I love her brain, feel like she missing teeth
Probably get another chain, I'm on my Mr. T
Made six G's this week in Mississippi
Speakers blew at my last show, but they ain't miss a beat
I'm on fire nigga, Richard Pete
Getting Richard Pryored on my next deal, yeah this is me
Lito, with my pistol and zip at least
Cashville's streets dry, but I move like they slippery
