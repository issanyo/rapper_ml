(We just still. Scared. Scarred
All we do is argue. All we do
All we do....)

[Verse 1, start]
All we do is argue...

I was supposed to rap right here, I couldn't even get that shit together. I'm faded. I don't know

Lito!
[Bridge]
Like a colored tee in a tub of bleach, I'm
//Faded...faded...faded...faded...//

(I'm faded. I'm still...)
Scared, scarred. I dunno what's gonna happen tomorrow but

[Verse 1]
All we do is argue, all we do is harbor
Our resentment like a farmer with his harvest and it's August
And this fall we facing famine... dammit
Get that so often, when I'ma take you off the market and make a family
Make an honest woman out you, but, honestly you lie too much
And I say that cuz you lied to me once
I know that's fucked up, but it hurt me, I tried to hide it for months
Too much pride to step aside I realized I'm not the guy that you want
If I could cry maybe I'd try, I'ma keep firing up blunts
Think about you when I watch baseball, or eat pretzels with Hawaiian Punch
Nevermind cuz I know, you'll never wind up happy
If you keep messing with me, either that or you gone get pregnant
And name the baby Regrettably, we could call her Greta
I wrote this as a letter, hope that'll upset ya, you can call me bitter
I call you a quitter, quit calling me stupid, you can call a Uber
You came here to visit, I cancelled your ticket
Can't hold conversation, we can't even kick it, you ain't even listening
Who have we been kidding, got a bad feeling this good riddance
And I admit I probably shouldn't have written it
Ain't no sense in apologizing, I've already accepted that you wouldn't forgive me
Ain't forgave you or myself, then I hate when you enjoy yourself
I don't know about no one else, but right now life seem so unfair
Feel like I got everything, only thing there's no one there

Lost in my mind, trapped in my feelings...

//Faded...faded...faded...faded...//
