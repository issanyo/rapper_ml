[Starlito]
You Caesar or Brutus?
Mitch or Rico?

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Yeah, I know right from wrong, but can't much tell friend from foe
My homie acting different, old lady tripping, I think she fucking us both
I think too much, I know, but we been through way too much
Not her, my dog, one of the only people I trust
Told him I had a ring picked out and a tux
We was eating off the same plug
And I see about any nigga he got beef with, cause that's love

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
Our M.O. was get money, fuck these hoes from the start
Now he say he bouta throw it all away for this broad
Fuck he mean, must be out his mind
He too focused on the pussy, should be focused on the grind
Don’t he know, one slip of the lip'll have us both doing time
Say my nigga bugging out and he don't recognize the signs

[Verse 3: Starlito]
I remember jumping out, I was next to him, firing
I ain't have nothing to do with that shit
But I was riding like that shit was mine
Everything I jeopardized, Jeffrey Dahmer inside
How it’s eating me alive, if I was weaker, I’d cry
I wanna look him in the eye just to see if he a lie
But I leave it be and be quiet, you know me and my pride

[Verse 4: Don Trip]
From the bottom we came, that’s my brother, I swear
And you'll have me at yo throat if you dare touch a hair
But it feel like something ain't right, like he ain't all the way there
It feel like something done changed, it bothers me cause I care
Now he might be acting funny 'bout that bitch, real shit
Say he think she’s a angel, I think she with the shit
I don’t trust that ho, fuck that ho, why he go and love her fo'
If the truth was medicine, I think he need a double dose
How we go from balling, screaming "money over bitches"
Now he taking care of hoes, got 'em all up in our business
Fuck is up?
Fuck is up?
I got money on my mind, I know that’s my nigga, but
If he fuck this mission up, then I gotta get him touched
I hate it, but lately he been loafing, he too caught in his emotions
Put his faith in that bitch, when that ho ain't worth a token
We not seeing eye to eye, it ain't over 'til it’s over
And the way this shit been going, look like I’m gon' have to smoke him
(What the fuck?)

[Verse 5: Starlito]
On the low, I been unfocused, I’m just hoping no one notices
Tryna play my cards right, but things got wild as the joker is
The things I love, I’ll kill for, call my bluff with no poker chip
Got this chip on my shoulder, which
Brings me to this lick I’m bouta hit, knew him since we was kids
Everything we got, we split
But when the sack hit, then it’s over with

[Verse 6: Don Trip]
Ride or die like a motorist, now I’m on some solo shit
The plug say we cop 'em as a team, or ain't no more bricks
Fuck it, talk him into moving on this last sack
Soon as we go pick it up, we hit the cut, "blap blap"
I’m just tryna eat, this is how it gotta be
Turned his back on all this money for a bitch I used to freak

[Verse 7: Starlito]
Need a bedtime story to read 'fore I put this nigga to sleep
Ask her if he ever tried her and I know she wouldn't lie to me
She just said I shouldn't trust him, never said she didn't fuck him
I'mma catch him when he bring his money, step to him, and flush him
And it’s nothing, blood money spent faster, I just laugh
Cause everything I love is in the past
And everything I love don't seem to last
I shouldn't have even asked
Cross him out and blame it on the cash, blood on my sleeve, brain on the dash
Dome him quick, fast, don’t forget the bag
Hurry home to my honey, my other homie hitting that, fuck is up?
Fuck is up?
