[Chorus: Starlito]
A time to kill, It's time to kill
I'm for real, I'm trying to chill
Riding with every gun I own, just me behind the wheel
It's time to kill, A time to kill (x2)

[Verse 1: Don Trip]
First all my dollas came
Then all my problems came
Now I really gotta watch these niggas
They quick to trade like like stock exchange
The music business is a awful game
Got all the dope I'm trying not to change
Go back to the trap, With the bales of weed
Bags of pills and blocks of cane
I walk around with this bulls eye
But it's even worse cuz I got a name
I got too many rounds in my magazine
It take everything in me not to bang
Got a major deal, Shit got insane
Got paranoid, Better watch it mane
Got too much pride and a loaded nine and..
I kill you over my pocket change
Now everybody got they hands out
Heard a check was coming and they camped out
Just take a glance in Jaylin's face
That's the only true reason I can smile
Can't quit, run or stand down
Surrender, Retreat or tap out
But If you do, I can't judge you
I got a pocket full of stonesin the glass house
The fuck everyone so mad bout?
Why? Cuz a nigga ain't crash out
On that MC Hammer can't touch this shit
Gettin all my mother fucking cash out
Fuck beef, I'm fucking sitting cash cow
I really am what I rap bout
And i'm ready to go fuck who or when
I got all mine on me right now, Nice!

[Chorus: Don Trip]
A time to kill, I'ts time to kill
I'm for real, I'm trying to chill
Riding with every gun I own, just me behind the wheel
It's time to kill, A time to kill (x2)

[Verse 2: Starlito]
You don't know how I felt
Fuck success
Know plenty niggas to the death with much less
Stress, No rest
Peace of mind? What the fuck is that?
I'm at war with myself
40 dollar jeans, 500 pairs
40 with the thirty round
Pray I don't pull it out
And spray this til there ain't a hollow left
Pow, Click Click Click.. Prolly still be shootin'
This right here that real music
Cuz I really will do it
Nigga when I met yo pussy ass
Yeen't even know what a choppa was..
My Glock like my dick
If I pull it out
If i'm pissed off
Gon' prolly bust
Rumor is I got robbed what..
Did the white house get shot up?
I'm at every show, studio, with a groupie ho
With my Glock tucked
The sneak attack
I'm hip to that
And we both know that you not tough
Who?.. Nevermind!
Now what the fuck Imma stop fuh?
Don't wanna hear that king shit
Up my way, If ya not Buck
Even he would agree that right now
Starlito's.. On top of this.. muthafuckin Ville shit
This muthafucking real shit
Fuck another deal bitch
But Trip it's time to kill this game
Yeah, we calling these niggas
Let's show these niggas
I know these niggas
And you know me nigga
Prolly owe me nigga
Wish I would go back to the old me nigga
Sleeping on me
That's why I don't sleep nigga
Heard a voice and it told me this
Invest inyourself and you gon be bigger
If you don't feel this then you only see the picture
If you don't read the words
Sometimes we think second and we just squeeze first
They either hate it or underestimate it
Can't slow me down, No need search
It don't work..
Chain smoke on the daily
Even tried some pills
Operating under direct order
Just one within
Fire at will..

[Chorus: Don Trip & Starlito]
A Time to kill, I'ts time to kill
I'm for real, I'm trying to chill
Riding with every gun I own, just me behind the wheel
It's Time to Kill, A time to kill (x2)

Wanna know what I got for Christmas?
A soul..
