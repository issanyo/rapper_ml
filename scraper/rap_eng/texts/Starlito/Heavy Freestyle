[Verse:]
I’m just a black youngster introverse
M town what it do
Talk about a young rich n*gga get some money
I used to be broke now
I used to know how to steal
I gotta put my all in this sh*t
My dick and my balls in this b*tch
I used to be broke now I’m here
I was grinding hard out of cashville
Underground legend all star
What chu know about a young rich n*gga spend 50 hundred dollars on a whip
That if and for them f*ck n*ggas
I know they hatin but God bless them
And I’m f*cked up found out
Who f*ck with me less a valuable lesson
Used to how know how to sleeping on the couch at the dope house
That was never sleeping on the floor
That can’t keep it out your homo
Whoa what chu know about
Young rich n*gga drop 32 racks on oyster perpetual
I want the money residual still go get it on schedule
Ask me why I ain’t sign yet
Cause my handwriting ain’t legible
Get your plan right and it’s cute
That your brand gotta protect it too
I’m just saying they out here finessing too
Just saying it can be a man standing right next to you
Election just to collection plate
I guess that was too heavy weight
I’m investing unless they investigate
I was texting yesterday with Kevin Gates
He just wanna know if the ledger straight
Still devastated by Corleone little situation
They say this the notify type my name
During litigation any given statements
How much money these lawyers make
Anyway I keep sending payments
I’m going through it
Getting money my heart is heavy
Love to hear the motor brah
Everytime I start to skirt
Parking lit grab the truck
4G auto lift it up
Flat black and of course it’s fast
Porsche drive like I don’t give a f*ck
They feel this sh*t cause it’s real as f*ck
Pint seared indictment said I’m just pouring up
Praying they don’t pick me up quiet
But you don’t want to f*ck with me
A rider was what I had ambitions of
Put your pair of glasses on load the wise words
Be quoted like I wrote em
So I’m a kill I’m a die for the sh*t that I love and you know
