[Intro]
Lito and Mista
Streets they want that real
Fuck that bullshit

[Chorus]
Streets they want that real shit, fuck that bullshit
All my shows like choir rehearal, feel like I'm in the pulpit
Fuck the industry I'm in these streets and bitch I'm hood rich

[Verse 1: Mista Cain]
Got a line of cars in the front yard, smokers knocking for a fix
On Plank Rd at the Texaco wit a 9 piece and a brick
Put my city on, no pity homes if you wanna act like a bitch
9 milli on me play silly homie and I'll rearrange yo shit
Where was you when it was war time? I never saw you no where
No man land I was out there, strapped down with them clips
Automatic down for a fuck nigga who won't get out his element
(What happened to him?) I send up with the pidgeons
Beat the murder trial no evidence got the Smith'n sleeping with the fishes
That's suicide if you ever think I'm slipping try to come get me
I'm going out with a big blast and a bet a nigga come with me
I'm a don in my city

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Doing a drive by in a hemi in yo front lawn with no semi
I don't need a nigga to vouch for me, I promise I'm wit it
Want a problem? Better bring Sadam and Osama nem wit ya
I don't mean no harm but a nigga momma can get it
I still got 50's of (CAIN) It's a cold game
Never look at niggas the same the way they giving up names
You a rat ain't shit to explain
The bigger the flame the quicker the change, I'm still in my lane
Red dot free, got a red dot on this bitch and magnificent aim

[Verse 3: Mista Cain]
Free Lil Buck and Lil Dane
Got my feet up on a plane
I'm g'd up on the Main
Roll up while she giving my brain
I got morals that live by
I know you smell the dro odor on me every day I high
Take me straight to the source
Hear the ape in my voice
With this Tec 9 get ya head lined like the front of the Source
Got a bitch she a horse, she like to scream til she hoarse
I got the Tec in the Porsche, if you run up it's yo choice

[Verse 4: Starlito]
Am I strapped up? Of course
My lil niggas trapping that boy
I'm not with the going back and forth
Except from the trap to the store, and court
Got a couple lawyers retained just for the days it rain
Fuck nigga play with Jermaine and I aim for his brain
Boosie came, Lucci on stage and that old Gucci Mane
I bust my fire before come try me hoe I do the same
Blow a nigga candles out with this lil Ruger flame
Go against that game, you stupid ain't ya?

[Outro]
Streets they want that real shit
Fuck that bullshit
Lito
