[Intro]
Whatever else happen, I ain’t forget

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Niggas ain’t talking bout much
I rather bump Willie Hutch or the music in church
Than a sacrilegious or blasphemous
I got loyal goons they don’t ask for much
And they don’t rap
But (pow pow) they’ll wrap you up
Yea
Trash bags for the shells
Trash bags half a bale
Got plays
Got [???]
Got sells
Where’s my scale
What the hell really going on
Not shit
Still going in on my songs
Blowing on this O so strong
All alone
But ya ho all on my mobile phone
I tried to tell her to get off my line
Quit all that lyin
Thought I was ballin when I first
Bought a nine
Use to think that time was money
Till they gave my homeboys all that time
Niggas not giving a fuck about nothing
I mean nothing
Shooting and hustling
I’m hot dog and the coupe is mustard
But I don’t relish that shit
What the hell is a brick
But a lick to a nigga that ain’t never had shit
Or a [???] over rap nigga embellishment
I intelligent from the head I get
She say she is celibate
I probably save that bitch
I had a girlfriend but I dumped her
I be high as hell
I hope she take me back

[Hook: Starlito]
You ever lost somebody
I mean really, really wish you could talk to somebody
But they was gone before you thought about it
You ever lost somebody
I mean really wish you could talk to somebody
But they was gone before you thought about it
Not brainstorming but my thoughts cloudy

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Yea these are scarttered showers
Sad as fuck at happy hour
Wishing I could laugh about it
We use to hit the lab and rap for hours
Now I’m giving his momma and daddy flowers
My only thoughts was gettting at them cowards
Killed my lil nigga and probably bragging bout it
Retribution
Do you gotta a better solution
They taught us to tote guns
Really they bread us as shooters
All we cared about getting fresh and hoopin
Same neighborhood that get executed
Same lil niggas use to sneak in the movies
I’m pretty sure gunfire killed more dreams than excuses
One by one losing everyone that believed in my movements
All I got is my weed and my music
This called keeping it moving
Yea this called keeping it moving
