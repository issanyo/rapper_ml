Yea
Shit
Damn
Step Brothers

They shooting up movies
They shooting up schools
Young black fools
Ain't the only ones that suit up with tools
Exercising my 2nd amendment and pleading the fifth
With A fifth
This my second this Remy
I drink, I don't sip
And the reason is this
It's fucked up out here
So we out here fucked up
If you make it out then you lucked up
Trying to save ourselves coming from
What we raised ourselves
Stuck between a rock and a hard place with the razor and scale
Turn wine back to grapes and it's raising hell
Breaking down bales
Just to make bail
Catching sells off a cell until you in a cell
I'm just trying to prevail
But only time will tell
Well, niggas telling over time
It ain't no telling
I ain't lying
Ain't trying to go out like my homies did
I keep that on me and I put that on my homies kid
Wonder if I gonna be missed
If I did a lonely bid
Got homies in the pen who only focus keeping a phone hid

I respect the time I keep my sneaks on tight
Head-on collision hope the seat belt right though
Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight
Praying to god I get a leash on life
Leash on tight
Only right that we know
And please don't judge us for the path we chose
Looking up to heaven; no one sending me signs
Only if this was a movie I would press the rewind

He got that strap in his bag
See he get bullied at school
Young nigga shot dead in his class
He put his school on the news
Now put yourself in his shoes
Walking away didn't help
He got no friends to defend him
He got to fend for his self
And he to skinny to fight
Running away just ain't cutting it
His daddy ain't home
His momma still struggling
She juggle three jobs
And get no help from the government
You don't know nothing about him
But you trying to sucker him
Heart of a giant
I'm sorry he will never back down
And they gonna keep pick on him till one day he blacks out
And reach in that book bag and he pull that mag out
Now he get the last laugh and you're just the class clown
Tool on deck
Yes I can't help that
When momma was stressing
I hit my block like a tailback
See we trying to make it don't got no suits
Just got cases
And I need more than this dope money to leave to my babies

I respect the time I keep my sneaks on tight
Head-on collision hope seat belt right though
Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight
Praying to god I get a leash on life
Leash on tight
Only right we know
And please don't judge us for the path we chose
Looking up to heaven; no one sending me signs
Only if this was a movie I would press the rewind
