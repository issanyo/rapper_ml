[Intro]
Well son, I'll tell you
All the time I's been turning corners and sometimes going in the dark where there ain't been no light
So boy, don't you turn back
Don't you fall now

[Chorus: Robin Raynelle]
It's been awhile since I seen you smile
Just want you to know I'm still proud
Don't care how nobody else feels about you
Slow down, I can't lose you
You're all I got, you're my only child

[Verse 1: Starlito]
I kinda want a baby, really don't know why
When I still drive my mama crazy
Really there's no such thing as perfect timing without no patience
Really need to be somebody patient, I ain't slept since graduation
You don't know my situation
Man I don't know what I'm facing and I hate it
They say congratulations but they really mad I made it
I just don't hesitate, man they wasn't really aggravated
And I know feelings don't matter but I been feeling madder lately
You don't get it homie, I just don't wanna disappoint that lady
At this point it's too late, they have my picture on front of the paper again
And guess what, she forgave me again
And then told me keep my distance from those who ain't really my friends

[Chorus: Robin Raynelle]
It's been awhile since I seen you smile
Just want you to know I'm still proud
Don't care how nobody else feels about you
Slow down, I can't lose you
You're all I got, you're my only child

[Post-Chorus: Robin Raynelle]
Never hesitate to call home
No matter what you're going through
'cause nothing in all creation
Can separate my love from you
Even as the world tries to take you down
Remember that you're special to me
Remember you're my everything
Remember when it was just you and me

[Verse 2: Starlito]
It's been a minute since I shed a tear
You taught me to never fear
John Madden, Michael Jordans, you bought me them every year
Told me to be my own man, and you said it clear
Life ain't been no crystal stair, I'm here through the consistent prayer
Wish I wasn't so good at holding grudges, ma you know I love you
Imagine how cold it'd make your heart to have you heat to go in public
Granny think I'm a perfect angel, even though I'm thuggin'
Face all on the news, ain't nothing changed
Y'all answer when no one doesn't
Don't know how you haven't given up on me, I forever owe you
Since I don't know when we'll go I want to let you know
Ever since I can remember, you been heroic
I love you, gotta get better at showin' it
'Cause lately I been stoic

[Chorus: Robin Raynelle]
It's been awhile since I seen you smile
Just want you to know I'm still proud
Don't care how nobody else feels about you
Slow down, I can't lose you
You're all I got, you're my only child
It's been awhile since I seen you smile
Just want you to know I'm still proud
Don't care how nobody else feels about you
Slow down, I can't lose you
You're all I got, you're my only child

[Outro: Robin Raynelle]
I know it's been a while
Ooh, and I don't care, yeah, oh yeah
