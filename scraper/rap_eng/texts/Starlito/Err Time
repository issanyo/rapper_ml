Drive bys out a van and i popped a xan
Fell asleep in my cutlass
I'm trippin, slippin the clip in i'm just reminiscing I'm still with the shit like divinci
I got the code, auto reload F&N ammunition
My hittas get paid on commission clips duck-taped extensions
Homicide promise imma slide just when you think i'm slippin get it
Slip-n-slide light bright bitch inside talkin bout take her to the house
If she'on put it straight in her mouth, imma make her get out
Ask my accountant to check my account man i just been countin' you can't even count
