Welcome to the heat academy
[Hook - Billy Falcon:]
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can say
Cause she's already inside
She's already in my DNA
D. N. A
It don't change
She's deep down inside
D. N. A
It don't change
She's deep down inside
[Don Trip:]
Can't get her off my brain or outta my mind
A nigga knows right from wrong but she blurs the line
Got her in my veins, I'm just tryna to survive
How come I can't see it coming? But like that say love is blind
No but the fact that she's actually not just here for my time
I got a heart made of gold, and she's here to mine
She's so poison but I want more
No I can't stop. I open Pandora's Box
Now I'm so outta my mind; she got me tied in a knot
She got me going in circles like all three hands on a clock
And I can't help it. I know I know better
The Devil wears Prada I plan to undress her

You probably not gon' admit it, to the point that you forgot that you did it
Lying to yourself Can't get over it
Planting seeds down on our ovaries
On the road to riches like a motorist, yeah
Every show it's a different bitch
Excess baggage on a "me go" trip
Ain't that somebody that you use to know?
You don't think she's noticing [x2]
Pregnant you don't even know it
Cause she ain't showing it yet
It ain't like you been payin' attention to her
Just finished 'bout to take off on a different tour
Thinks she's in love cause ya'll live together
And everything she ask for you give it to her
But your bullshit is really getting to her
Now you asking what's wrong with' her
But you gettin' to it
More of the secret plus she's sick of your shit
When it hard nights by her self
Ain't his name Schwarzenegger he's the terminator
No call or nothing, another five year text
She figured she was doing you a favor
