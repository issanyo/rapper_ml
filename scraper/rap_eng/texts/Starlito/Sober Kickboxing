[Verse 1: Starlito]
People keep telling me I'm finna blow like I don't know
I'm t and t tired and thrown
I been out on the road balling out of control like I'm out on parole
Keep it real with my Niggas but I lie to them hoes
I gotta lot of them hoes
I went to college before I study p-i-m-pology tho
Ya probably think I'm rocking up dope
Lil homie gotta flow that's as hot as a stove
Put it in the microwave I gotta go
That was so 2004
Newspaper on the public housing floor doing algebra
100 x pills taken out of the stove Why cause it equal bout a thousand bruh
Money keep on piling up
Firefighter style Lil bruh
Its lito smooth but I'm wild as a Buck
Speaking of whom free him too
I heard Lil boosie might be home soon
I'll love to book him for a show I'm always hustling you know what I'm doing
Grinding hard you know times is hard
Still ain't easy in the ville we in the middle of killing season
These Niggas ain't Eating give em a reason
This is for the Niggas that didn't believe me
Soon as the money gone bitches leaving
And they ain't gone visit you neither
Numbers get changed pictures deleted



[Verse 2: Starlito]
Voices in my head every time I say my prayers
I'm on that thin line between prepared and scared
These Niggas will get you fucked up
Stay away from round em
And if they switch sides on ya you might have to down em
Homeboys went on tour I was selling quarter ounces
Flipped that to a studio grinded up on bout 40thousand
Bought a bell for thirty thousand fronted one for thirty thousand
I decided I wouldn't paying and I'm no longer worried bout em
Call me wrong cause if I answer the phone
I know I'm sitting Right Here but behind these shades I'm gone
You ain't on what I'm on
I'm on some other shit
I called her up and said Fuck it I love you bitch
She laughed and said I hate you too
We probably Fuck later look what you made me do
So reckless so careless I make her lazy too
We Just be cool
Don't need to stupid shit Just to say we cool
Everybody wanna be a wannabe stay in school
I wanna be a colored T in a tub of bleach get faded fool
And I say Fuck whoever made the rules
We go broke and then we break em and then we make the news
If only the newspaper knew
The ultimate fight ain't on pay per view
We Just been lied to
But then we make it true
Just like a classroom
Yea with a substitute
Which means it's up to you
You leave it up to them they say we got nothing to look forward to
