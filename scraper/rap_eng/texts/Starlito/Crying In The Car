[Intro]
Lito
I tried to call my mama but I really wasn't trying to make her sad with all this shit, so I wrote it

[Chorus]
Just got through crying in the car
Wish I could rewind to back when times weren't so hard
Trying to remind myself that I done came so far
So much on my mind and plus I'm blinded by my heart
Just got through crying in the car
Wish I could rewind to back when times weren't so hard
Trying to remind myself that I done came so far
So much on my mind and plus I'm blinded by my heart

[Verse 1]
I can't even lie
My feelings hurt, I just want to hurt some feelings
I don't know a worser feeling, I can't go to church for healin'
So I use my First Amendment, took 'bout thirty minutes
Wrote this verse and I mean every word that's in it
These streets don't love nobody, 'til you get murdered in 'em
I'm always nervous, I'm still serving with a verdict pending
The first will be here before I know it, I got to hurry up and get it
Yeah, and being broke give me allergic symptoms
If I sit still then I get motion sickness
Emotional rollercoaster, tryna hold it in when I pose for pictures
I ain't the only one, we all got issues
Smoke a lot of weed but I'm proud to say I'm finally off prescriptions
'Bout to start back hoopin', I spent too much time 'round all these pistols
Sweat the alcohol out my system, think through all decisions
I speak with all this wisdom but it's deep, am I conflicted?
Sometimes I want to disappear to see if y'all miss me

[Chorus]
Just got through crying in the car
Wish I could rewind to back when times weren't so hard
Trying to remind myself that I done came so far
So much on my mind and plus I'm blinded by my heart
Just got through crying in the car
Wish I could rewind to back when times weren't so hard
Trying to remind myself that I done came so far
So much on my mind and plus I'm blinded by my heart

[Verse 2]
Back to back firing up cigars
Yeah we always argue but this time it went too far
I'm in that Porsche, I got that draco
I'm out my mind, I'm on them bars
I threatened this nigga and I meant it
He went downtown and pressed the charge
(I guess it's better than me gettin' a first degree)
If I ain't caught the other case, I was going to kill you (for real)
Crazy how the same shit that hurt you can heal you
Foolish pride, I heard that it's worse when you're brilliant
Shrinking circle, it's always a person familiar
Draw back the curtains, reveal, I always was off the dribble
Learn what wasn't taught, 'cause I always thought different
Y'all will be alright, if y'all just take care of y'all business
Rather that you thought I was tripping than get caught slipping

[Chorus]
Just got through crying in the car
Wish I could rewind to back when times weren't so hard
Trying to remind myself that I done came so far
So much on my mind and plus I'm blinded by my heart
Just got through crying in the car
Wish I could rewind to back when times weren't so hard
Trying to remind myself that I done came so far
So much on my mind and plus I'm blinded by my heart
