This is precicely the kind of hype that i'm about

And i'm on it (burn one)

Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights
I prefer them light bright

Wa -la!! I’m so throwed, i Went through my phone and called all my hoes
When on the pill anything goes
You know me i never trick my hoes
Don't indulge in what i sold
And that's why i stop selling Dro
Still got the pints for the low
Hey shawty stop at the store (to get a sprite)
She's like Starlito slow mo
[?]
Just my numb cocaine flow, she goes dumb with the brains oh [?]
I think she wanna fuck my clean Benz, say if its cool can she bring a friend
2 on 1 handicap match, three way like a Chris [?]

Im so high of the life
Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights

So fly I'm on autopilot, so high i don't know how I'm driving
When i get dressed i boost my sky mileage, and all the rappers wan't my stylist, I'm one of a kind my style is, probably the same reason the girl smilin

You don't do what? girl you childish., im droppin you back off, don't worry bout it
She went from hard to get, to gettin it hard
And they hardly ever get to Star
Want me to pay for her pedicure, I'm like ok whatever sure
Knowing good and well ion like feet
Open minded girls I like freaks
Specially the ones that like me, same night I'm on flight three

Im so high of the life
Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights
I prefer them light bright

I prefer a fast car and drive slow
Smoke back to back until my eyes glow
Star in the game [?] no less survival, middle finger to the five' o
[?]
Just evidence that i gettin rent
Black leather mess my Jordans, she treats me better than her boyfriend
She says he's jealous and i see why, i understand you've got too lean back
She in love and I'm not even tryin, i ain't givin up no DNA for the CSI
No sprinklers could extinguish that, [?] purple rain in this weed fire? [?]
Attempted murder yet a decent try, but i keep my burner ain't no need to die
Not tonight

Im so high of the life
Im gonna need Some dro to help me come down tonight
Im gonna need a ho but where I’m from we call them flights
