[Chorus]
They say you are what you smoke, well that make me an OG. [2x]
P's of that master kush, let's just say I'm bout it bout it [2x]
Had yo main bitch getting high, just last week thank god I ducked that DUI

[Starlito]
Windows up, defrost on, no rear view Five cell phones, Styrofoam, paranoid as fuck. When I be driving home I'm high, known to been riding alone, beside that I been grinding so long. Smoke til I can't move a muscle to remind myself that my mind so strong. Speaking of strong, Thats all star smoke. Caught the little joke Star-li-to
Pour a deuce, and another deuce, call it little joke
Called this hoe, she wanna know why I'm talking so slow, woah, I'm not high, I'm resting my eyes
Sippin that other, can't find no purple
I'm fiending, so I'm on the yellow like calling the how much they sellin, I need it
I'm paying whatever, I fly to wherever, stay til whenever
I got a weed man in bout twenty cities, I stay on my level
Get the check cause I clock out when I o'clock in
I stay on schedule, time is money. I know it's right based on what I pay for the bessel
Twenty more bands just to flood the Benz, get babe on shovel she diggin the kid
My fragrance aside what niggas smoke for once then it is what it is

[Chorus]
They say you are what you smoke, well that make me an OG. [2x]
P's of that master kush, let's just say I'm bout it bout it [2x]
Had yo main bitch getting high, just last week thank god I ducked that DUI

[Young Dolph]
I bought a whole pint and threw a Texas tea party
Got blunts, papers, and a quarter P of weed on me
With two bitches getting high in the Cadillac. Took them to the spot, turned into a rated X wrestling match
The bitch start talking too much so I said fuck that here hit this
I can tell that she blow so I undid my farragamo belt said kiss this
If you are what you smoke then I guess that make me a skywalker. AKA codeine stalker
Tell me where it's at and I'm coming for it
Been drinking all day still pouring out fours nigga four in the morning
You little niggas want to get high like me, but they can't afford it
I ain't been doing shit but getting money, I mean getting high. Just got a phone call from my cashville, bruh they say that the turkey fried

[Chorus]
They say you are what you smoke, well that make me an OG. [2x]
P's of that master kush, let's just say I'm bout it bout it [2x]
Had yo main bitch getting high, just last week thank god I ducked that DUI
