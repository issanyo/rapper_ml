[Intro]
I put my brain on do not disturb

[Chorus]
I just wanna be alone
I don't even need a phone
I don't need to be at home
But sometimes I don't wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone
I don't even need a phone
I don't need to be at home
But sometimes I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
I get so lonely
I call your bitch, she pull up on me and I fuck on her
I don't even want her, I just hope she leave before the morning
If I have to put her out then she gon' be so disappointed
I ain't got too many friends, we family or we ain't homies
Ain't no need to roll with me if you don't keep a heater on you
Oh we been known to go to sleep when we don't want to
Keep it in the streets, be discreet, ain't no speaking on it
Can't believe you told it, make a plea lil forty, and you know what?
Hate that I provoked him and then gave him free promotion
People that's the closest say that I ain't been showing no emotion
So many so-called real niggas doing ho shit, keep your distance

[Chorus]
I just wanna be alone
I don't even need a phone
I don't need to be at home
But sometimes I don't wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone
I don't even need a phone
I don't need to be at home
But sometimes I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 2]
If you think you're lonely now
Just wait until tonight, look here, I ain't gon' stay the night
I break your heart, I break a promise, and I ain't gon' make it right
And we ain't got much in common if you came up overnight
Grinded for it, I swear I grinded for it
Let's draw that line between what's mine and yours
No I ain't change, just don't got time for it
Man fuck that shit, fly the chorus, flyin' solo in my form

[Chorus]
I just wanna be alone
I don't even need a phone
I don't need to be at home
But sometimes I don't wanna be alone
I just wanna be alone
I don't even need a phone
I don't need to be at home
But sometimes I don't wanna be alone
