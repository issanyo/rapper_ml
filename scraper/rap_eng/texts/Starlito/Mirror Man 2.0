[Intro-Starlito]
Man shit fucked up, I got to be patient
Fucked up, it fucked up man
Trakksounds (Trakksounds)
I might do anything, If it meant for ya shh

[Verse 1-Starlito]
I was tryna flip, gon buy me a whip
Lost it at the dice game, I bet on a 6
Nah I'm ready to take something, weapon on hip
Cause it ain't too many jobs that a felon can get

Quit, them excuses, cut the Negative shit
The devil in ya head, and you letting him exist
Road to success, you gon be dead in a ditch, or in jail cause a snitch say you be sellin them zips
I'm tryna settle down with this intelligent chick
Let her tell me when I'm trippin, and help me get rich
Hang around 10 clowns, knwo who the eleventh one is (You)
I'm just tellin you whats real, you ain't got to listen

We can finish this talk when you get out of prison
But don't you sit there like I don't know how you been feelin
Less paper, than patience ready to make a killin
I ain't got shit to prove about how I was livin
All the shit I went through war, wounds, and wisdom
Court rooms visit, and my business keep me too busy (Lito)
(Lito)

Tryna keep my distance from these bitches
Who all of a sudden treat me different now (ahh) I'm getting (ahh)
Fuck that, I'm so frustrated to see me
The plug keep pump faking, I been thinking about giving
But what about when that run out?
Fuck it, I just need something now

Telling ya that shit get old, ridin around with you gun out
Nigga you got a son now, and he look just like you
And if you fuck up, he gon fuck up and b just like you
Yeah go ahead, clip up, get the biggest riffle
Get life, then see if any of you bitches write you

Damn, I never looked at it that way before

When you can't even count your blessing
That's when you really broke
Worst time getting arrested, when the stash getting low
First time getting this message from a rap nigga though
I used to trap by the store, right on the run way
Day time dice game, night time gun play
Top story evening news twice on the front page
Shit I'm alive, and ain't get life, so I can't complain
Why front, I had hunger pains, no lunch for days
Stayed in trouble comin of age, duckin a bunch of strays
Yeah, it ain't no winners in this fuckin game
The OG's the one to blame, if don't nothing change
If I know better, and don't tell ya different, I'm ashamed
I live that shit, you can fail till you quit, I promise mane
It seem like only thing come on my way is problems, and pain
I got a plan, and some patience, them commas came
Lito

I'm Moving to Houston
