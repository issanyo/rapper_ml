[Verse 1-Starlito]
She just want the money, I can't even blame her
Really that's how I trainer her
Mother fuck the fame, and me I'm fresh up out a face
Pullin up late night, I hope I never see her neighbors
Fast break, I'm plays of the week, cause I don't layup
Sometimes I get lazy and make her weigh up (weigh up)
Can't play no captain safe, no way see ya later (see ya later)
Don't care if you are faithful, just bring me the paper (bring me the paper)
Everywhere I go they ask me (Lito) who you play for (who ya play for)
Lito
Lito
Had to let her go she was to ungrateful
She just want the money
Don't we all, she just want the money

[Verse 2-Don trip]
Well, Well I ask her for her name (well)
She ask me what I drive, I say pretty bitches, crazy baby what you like to ride
She say she not into broke niggas (well)
Guess I'm just some lame cat, she looked at my watch
Said that's hot, but where you chain at
I couldn't do nothing but laugh
I guess we tip the tab (I guess)
Cuase I just want some ass, and all she want is my cash (that right)
Sorry darling it ain't poppin, ain't no way ill take ya shopping
God bless us all, but I don't even pay offering (damn)
And payin for us not an option, (nah)
I'd rather do the dashboard in my red line
Throwin all my money out the sunroof
Before I crash out, and give a crumb to you (damn)
Don't know what this world coming to, them Trip niggas be jumpin hopes
But to me shes just a piece of pussy, so I respect the game and keep it pushin

[Hook-Starlito]
She just want the money

Don't we all, she just want the money

[Verse 3- Petty]
Now when that cash hit the floor, don't rush it
You moving to fast baby, slow it down (slow it down)
You got that type of ass even hoes wanna touch
Don't move it to fast baby, slow it down (slow it down)
Make niggas love it (love it) , like this shit bussin (bussin)
I pay no mind, (I pay no mind) pay bitches nothing (nothing)
To the money she devoted, like my older swisher loaded
Spend that rollie on a hoe, break a bitch, make it quick
Tell me how we make you feel, when you see a PIMP shine (shine)
You wasted to much time, get back up, stack up, racks up, that's a
I see it poking, got potential getting It
Pour Pimping, post up why she picturing benjis nigga

[Hook-Starlito]
She just want the money
She just want the money
Don't we all, she just want the money

[Verse 4-WILX]
Went to bed last night with 2 bitches (two bitches)
I ain't even cut em (nah), still had em in stiches
Just kickin it, they laughing at them niggas
That they be fuckin with, bout how they weed stay up to par
But they credit score ain't shit, (yeah)
Told her mine was decent, (mine was decent)
Plus the tree we smoking free, pussy come in by the pounds
So, if you wanna roll with me, need yo mind potent
Don't be blinded by this potent
Some people be blinded by this potent shit
Please just don't be nosey, please sometimes I might ignore my phone
Sometimes I be in my zone, make em do a lot danger
But I can't make em leave me alone (alone)
Old things that be startin lust, them things just can't get enough
That's why I'm rockin Jordan's mane
I can do without the cuffs, suddenly its such a rush
We talk and such, but don't talk to much
Rub on that button, and cut it ?
The game remains, playa change (plays change)
New day, new age
