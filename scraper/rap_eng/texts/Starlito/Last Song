One more song..
One more blunt..

Damn, I really need to charge my phone
Probably need to be on my way home..
Fuck it, turn the beat up
I'm gon' fire this blunt up
And I'm gon' put my heart in this song..

[Verse 1]

Big homie got shot, I lost my mind
One of the first times in a long time I was off my grind
Lil homie got killed, and I never got over it
I never was sober since, and I was totin' it
Back to '06, niggas beefin' 'bout old shit
Hoe shit, I don't know shit
Fast forward to 07, riding with known felons
Grindin', coke sellin', be quiet, no tellin'
Late night hotellin', X-pill wholesellin'
Beef shit came first, record deal came second
Missed one flight then I damn near got killed
Wonder how I feel, eyes ain't dried still
Niggas still look at me like I ain't out here
But fuck how y'all feel, 'cause that ain't my reel
I don't hide behind nothing, just me, I'm all I got
Just me and all these shots
All they wanna know is when I'm gonna drop
All you need to know is I'm not gonna stop

[Verse 2]

Niggas hoes and I ain't forgot
But I ain't aiming at y'all, I'ma aim for the top
Look I ain't finna fall and I ain't finna stop
I ain't chasing the broads, I'm chasing the gwap
I celebrate for my dogs, 'cause I came from the block
They on lock, they can't give much, so they give props
And we show love 'cause we straight thugs
Young niggas balancing out three, four plugs
Ya hear me? X-Pill, weed, or the D
I mean, if it's got to be done, then leave it to me
I mean, had a connect out of state, beef up the street
Niggas pistol play and see if I squeeze (pow)
Don't get carried away
I mean, you run up on me, you get carried away
I ain't embarrassed to say
Cashville, I'm there everyday with a K
Who want it with me?
