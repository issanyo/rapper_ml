Man, I'm just tryna grind up on a fortune
Just got my oil changed in a loaner Porsche
I hit the dice game put that on my mortgage
Still make that bitch pay for her own abortion
I fucked your wife and told her don't divorce you
I'm either going to court or going to Nordstrom
You file police reports and getting extorted
I smoke a zip and sell 'bout 60 quarters

[Don Trip]
Your opinion make you feel important
If you don't work you don't deserve a portion
Dirty bowls in a Ford Explorer
You call that being broke, I call it torture
All these guns I feel like a hoarder
Ain't got no cases I still pay my lawyers
Growing up they wanted to be like Jordan
Silly me, I wanted to be Richard Porter

[Starlito]
That's to my niggas told me prison boring
So I just avoid it, I'm busy touring
Your president orange, I'm in that foreign

[Don Trip]
If it ain't profits, I must ignore it
I can't afford it
When real niggas stand still, that's rigor mortis
When I get tired of running this shit, like Clinton Portis
I'm making sure I got my slice like ninja tortoise

[Starlito]
And nigga I'ma rock my ice at each performance
Get that ass shot like dice for reaching for it

[Don Trip]
And you just got more than you can bite if the beef you ordered
When you can spit it half this nice, who needs a chorus?
Got enough bags of grass to become a florist
We representing for all real niggas cause there's a shortage

[Starlito]
Back in '04 man, I used to record in a storage
Niggas been hating since then I went and got more rich
Just left West Inn in a Benz, I was with your bitch
Told that hoe, “Hoe no photos or portraits”
I had the filet, she had the swordfish
Tipped the valet, I drove away then I enjoyed her lips
Yeah she topped me off but I get bored quick
So I dropped her off cause she annoying

[Don Trip]
I had to commend my brother, that lil bitch was gorgeous
You the kind of nigga buy that bitch a dozen orchids
And wine and dine that bitch and send her gifts and shit just for a kiss
I bet you call it pure bliss, I call it ignorance

[Starlito]
And we laugh at your goofy ass before she press ignore again
Texting all them threats you sending, you gon' kick her door in
You're so insecure nigga, we just call you Lawrence
Ain't tryna meet her mama them, don't wanna be her boyfriend
FNH should give me and this nigga an endorsement
Everyday civilians getting killed by law enforcement

[Don Trip]
I play for the green, I'm 'bout that check like I'm from Oregon

[Starlito]
Must I remind you, like my first line, I'm just tryna grind up on a fortune
