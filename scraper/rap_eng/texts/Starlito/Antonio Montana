(Starlito)
I was 'bout to cop the Porsche, had no one to sign for the Panamera
Still blew half a hunnid (racks), Forgi's on that black Camera
Tell me where to meet, I'm coming with a trash bag
Got a pound beside me right now, no hash tag
But if the topic is gwap, well lets chop it up, and make it a trend
I'm so high I'm seeing double, on a double date with twins
So that's 4 hoes in in this 4x4, double cup on a double stack
I'm twice as real you twice as fake so I just bought another strap
Told you I'm throwed off
Sippin on that school zone my apologies I dozed off
Oh, ok, I'm reloaded
Fired my new ho, she remind me of my old bitch
The last 2 weeks I made 30 racks, still reminds me of a whole brick
I've been gettin' so much gwap I forgot how to fold it
No shit
So many shows they think we got them bricks again
Or Chino got a shipment in
Or Elroy hit a lick for 10
Same crew
Wonder if you let that money change you
Or numb you, and go to your brain the same way the cocaine do
I hear these little lame dudes sayin' the same shit knowin' it ain't true
My niggas in halfway houses and got bracelets on their ankles
My other homies in college and I'm sure they feel my pain too
Had a dream like Dr. King and damn, it damn near came true
If you order 1 1/2, I might bring 2 when I came through
We heavy nigga!, In the lab right now with a bad bitch, a jar and some drank too
More of a Carlito then a Tony Montana
U might think I'm a handyman how I'm holdin' my hammer (retarded)
Fly nigga, yea I got my pistol
And if any of them pussies think they tough, they more than welcome to die wit you
Bullets at yo chest, Joe Montana
Who shoot 'em, how the fuck should I know? I was in Atlanta
At the 12, pourin' a 12 in a 3 liter Fanta
Got the mids goin' for 12, I sold 12 in the Panarama
Rode through Haynes Manor, the police hot as ever, I can't stand them
Its like money don't even matter, these niggas shootin' over bandannas
The West Side is still greivin', matter a fact, the Ville greivin'
Rest in peace Lil Bo, Lil Sammie, Skeet and that's how I'mma leave it (gone)
