[Intro-Satrlito]
Haha, ahh shit
Probably get a little more accomplished if my attention span wasn't so short
(Trakksounds)
Haha, yeah
Real rap, real rap
Lito

[Verse 1- Starlito]
I know you probably heard it before, but I don't wanna serve no more
Allergic to broke, so I feel like I deserved the doe
There is consciences if they catch me, curtains closed
Furthermore I been sleep less, and working more
Since when had the first came slow, I don't recall
? be tall, through the spring and the summer
Ball till you fall
Call me slim, I'm a pimp and a thug
Underground all, I want it all
I might not call, but gotta love me despite the flaws
No I don't like the laws, but still fight for a righteous cause
No what its like to damn near give up, and feel like ya lost
No that look like a lick, but know you are more than likely to get caught
Now your living through pictures, you get to write em, and call
Ahh, Nah don't get down on yourself
Close encounters with death, know there is more to life than I thought
Lito

[Chorus-Starlito]
I don't wanna serve no more
I don't wanna serve no more, I don't wanna serve no more
I don't wanna serve no more, I don't wanna serve no more
Nah, I don't wanna serve no more, I don't wanna serve mo more
I don't
I don't wanna serve no more, I don't wanna serve no more

[Verse 2-Starlito]
It's workin slow, I'm just wishin it will hurry up and go
Even servin on a Sunday, seatin in church with it on me
Personally I feel like something cursing me homie
Even worse than these purchases they keep purchasing it from me
Grind until you shine, but guess its worth it to stuntin
Why spend it as soon as you get it, if the purpose money
I ain't in this shit for an image, every verse is a hunnid
I remember not having a penny, that shit hurt to my stomach
No choice, but to hustle, my back against the wall
No happy endings though, I had to evolve
Still properly lie if she ask why I ain't call
Still traumatized from what happened to my dog

[Chorus-Starlito]
I don't wanna serve no more
I don't wanna serve no more, I don't wanna serve no more
I don't wanna serve no more, I don't wanna serve no more
Lito
