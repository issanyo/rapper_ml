[Verse 1 - Starlito:]
Ya homie just died
Didn't nobody ride
Ya hoes 40 on my waist
Not talkin' bout the size of my clothes
The streets they got hot
So, I had decide to get low
Man fuck what you talkin' bout I'm a just grind, and get dough
Been runnin' this check up
Still never ran in my life
Them people ain't playing man
Get you a plan, or get life
I sleep when I can, I'm a see if I can tonight
I'm filling a liter with 2 minds, and a can of sprite
Fuck you mean, my ways been gettin' handled off-site
And now they hand me 10 racks fore they hand me the mic
Grind hard muthafucka, grind hard
Grind hard muthafucka
Nah, there ain't no if and or mights

[Chorus - Starlito:]
Your runnin' Mama crazy, just stop
Always runnin' shit hot
I used to wanna run Hip-Hop
Can't run from no police, might get shot
Runnin' up the check, around the clock
Runnin' up the check, around the clock
Runnin' up the check, around the clock
Runnin' up the check, I can't stop

[Verse 2 - Starlito:]
No license, ridin' dirty
Plus hes speeding with the bad tags
Got this bomb like
It's Baghdad
And a strap cause
It's that bad
Go to war bout nothin' consequences
Repercussoins secondary
Beef we don't discuss it
When them folks said flush it (flush it), fuck it (fuck it), Yeah
Ion't want for but locked up
I can't make nothin'
I get it back, says the law of attraction
Y'all niggas acting
And we all bout dat action
Yeah, shout out to my dawg
They ball with' my advance
When I'm in the lessons
I bought, I do not blame that man
Fucked up a lot of money when
I was hangin' with Pacman
Heard niggas had some cheese on my head
I ain't a Packers fan

[Chorus - Starlito:]
Your runnin' Mama crazy, just stop
Always runnin' shit hot
I used to wanna run Hip-Hop
Can't run from no police, might get shot
Runnin' up the check, around the clock
Runnin' up the check, around the clock
Runnin' up the check, around the clock
Runnin' up the check, I can't stop
