[Verse 1: Starlito]
Threw a slumber party in the studio
Saved the session as a  souvenir, told shawty to shoot me to the store
This is NBA Jams turbo boost code in juice mode
I’m alley hoop throwed, Stingray coupe flow
Step Brothers 2 though

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
Still getting head like a nouveau
Bout my business like suit coat
My soul is not for sale even if I own my own shoe store
They wanna talk wordplay
I’m bout more checks than a survey
Bout to bring an end to the week like the day after Thursday

[Verse 3: Starlito]
What a business week, these niggas weak as SWV knees
Still down for the dirty dollars, I guess I’m in 3-D
Might sound effortless, nevertheless curse and blessing to have seen things
Exceptional recollection except for when questioned in precincts

[Verse 4: Don Trip]
And I shall be fly till I die like a bee sting
Your girl give my dick suga 'til I’m sleep sweet dreams
I just wanna ball, that’s all, no hoop dreams
Meanwhile I’m all over her tongue like shoe strings

[Verse 5: Starlito]
I get high top with drop, got the shit hot, not to throw rocks
But watching the throne is like watching the cops
A lot of these niggas been watching us honestly
Suckers get popped
Lollipop the chopper, I don’t pop mollies... no more

[Verse 6: Don Trip]
I take more shots than a paparazzi, no photos
Life is sweet but still sucks like a snow cone
Got some shooters on payroll and what you don’t know is
They’ll come get up with your stupid ass pro bono

[Verse 7: Starlito]
Let’s go four more, that’s four four four four
What Bo don’t know, I’m a legend in two games, that’s grind and I’m on
The nights get so long, I am so gone
Hydrocodone, for the five going strong
You get this hundred pack for four hundred thrown

[Verse 8: Don Trip]
I’m never lying to my fans, it’s like I’m rapping under oath
And I’m so fucking fresh to death my wardrobe is comatose
My lil brother still in the trap
Although I’m on the road to get that white girl sold like all Madonna shows

[Outro: Starlito & Don Trip]
I got all kind of droves
Step Brothers
