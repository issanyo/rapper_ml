[Verse 1: Starlito]
My nigga just drank him a four sum
Figured out that ain't for me
Really ain't that important
Free the lil Youngboy
Got a whole lotta pistols
Really want one more
Pull up on Don Trip that nigga crip like the gun store
Thirty in my .40 burn you and your homies
Drop a moneybag on you make you turn against your homies
Enough billets for all y'all
But I prefer to catch you lonely
It's gon' be a murder I'ma have a murder whipping on me
Bet your shirt look like you squirted ketchup on it
High alert yeah vest up
'Lito sound a little aggressive don't he
I ain't even on it I know a nigga don't even want that
You gon' have some niggas at your studio that don't rap
Shooters on location you gon' think we got your phone tapped
This a itch I'm gon' scratch
Pistol whip you on snap
I ain't even dissing, you a bitch and that's a known fact
Don't play with that money
You know how I'm coming
I'm gon' kill sum

[Skit: Step Brothers]
You wanna go do karate in the garage?
Yup!

2017 Karate in the garage

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
Little ol' me carbon kid
Clip long as a hockey stick
Strapped like I'm appearing for a zombie apocalypse
Everyday's a great day to me
I'm such an optimist
'Cause I remember vividly when I had no pot to piss
All you can eat, tryna be all we can be
My lil homie from the Chi tried to sell me an RPG
Ion't know which was worse
Him tryna sell it or me tryna buy it
I'm in my house surveying my closet
Looking for somewhere to hide it
I prolly would have bought it too
I prolly would have made the news
Aim that son bitch at your house and literally raise the roof
Crash out, I ate your hoe til she cash out
She like to ride a nigga low key
Like a whip with the tags out
Straght to the bank from the stash house
"I'll like to make a deposit"
How you got all them chains on
When all your babies is starving?
I'm sick of these rap niggas
But hey, what can you do?
Walking round like my shit don't stink
Feeling like Pep√© le Pew
