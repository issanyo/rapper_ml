[Intro: Starlito]
GhettOut
Nah, we ain't the same, hmm
You got that ho on retainer, I don't do no explaining
I'll never be famous, I go everywhere with my banger
You'll tell everything to a stranger, let me guess, you a gangster
I ain't scared of you motherfuckers, I'm just afraid of my

[Chorus: Starlito]
If she love me like she say she love me we gon' be alright
I still call and check up on her just to see if she alright
Never home, I'm living wrong, I know I need to treat her right
She just picked me up from a flight, I take back off, I leave tonight

[Verse 1: Starlito]
I'm living fast, two twenty-five on the dash
I'm really getting to a bag, these niggas livin' in the past
Let's talk facts, I'm the one with them racks
I'm the one that'll pull up on you all by myself with that MAC
I'm the one niggas pull up on and I tell 'em pull around the back
Pull it out the back, pop it out the vac sack
Know I'm probably gon' tax
If you know I got it on me, showing out for the police
I think you a rat
Just took a loss, I think about eighty racks
All I can think 'bout is making it back
If this plug just keep it coming, fuck it we gon' be alright
I done ran a check up on 'em but I still will squeeze on sight
Whippin' on me when I'm wrong
But yeah they still gon' read my rights

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
I'm the one with the thirty rounds on the twelve gauge
Chopper singing, let it serenade
I got everything but a hand grenade
I was really gon' blow, I was like fourteen makin' pipe bombs
Now I got a little more sense but I'll still shoot like a Nikon
Wrong place at the wrong time
But you niggas fuckin' with the right one
They call Craig Petties notorious
But where I'm from he's an icon
Being broke ain't never no fun
Back when they ain't have a GoFundMe
I was moteling with a snow bunny
Paying all our bills with my dope money
Truth is, I been broke before, broke and poor
I ain't even gon' front
I brought steak for dinner
But all my daughter want is cinnamon toast crunch
I keep the rifle like I go hunt, I stack the paper like a whole bunch
I say life is sorta like a toilet seat
You come pulling shit, I'm gon' dump
Hope you got life insurance, big time
Poppin' shit like the brick guy 'til they pop your ass
And your mama can't afford to bury you without a fish fry
No rest, I can never loosen up, something like a ziptie
Got incendiaries in that thirty round, I'll hop out on you and spit fire

[Verse 3: Starlito]
That's overkill, I'm in over-grind like it's overtime, I don't get tired
You a ho for real, and a pussy, that's why you always be dick ridin'
We might've fell out but I never switched sides
And I never let shit slide
Fuck your baby mama while the kid nap
Doin' drive-bys out the bitch ride
Selling mid out a rental from Enterprise
They ain't have nothing bigger than a midsize
That's the difference between hitters and sendouts
Don't tell me lil nigga, I been about it
Seventy-five round drum with me now
Ten pounds in the penthouse
I just opened one and the shit loud
I just sold three for like ten thousand
Me and bro gon' break these other six down
Yeah we gon' be alright
I just need a light, step brothers for life
GhettOut

[Chorus: Starlito]
If she love me like she say she love me we gon' be alright
I still call and check up on her just to see if she alright
Never home, I'm living wrong, I know I need to treat her right
She just picked me up from a flight, I take back off, I leave tonight
