[Intro: Starlito]
I'm jus trying some shit too
I was in the airport all day (laughs)
Better than what I use to do all day
Grind hard, muthafucka, grind hard

[Hook: Starlito]
Yea, remember when I was fucked up won't nobody give me nothing (nothing 3x)
Remember when I was fucked up won't nobody give me nothing (nothing 3x)
Remember when I was fucked up won't nobody give me nothing (nothing 3x)
Remember when I was fucked up won't nobody give me nothing (nothing 3x)
(Remember)

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Damn, I might be the only one make it
Travel down a path less taken (Lito)
Won't bend
Can't break me
I'm in that Benz thinking
We was jus friends now they hating
Is it because my aspirations
Wasn't middle class?
Cause you niggas faker
Than a stripper's ass
(Look here) I wake up trying to get a bag
Check chasing
If I take it you can't get it back
I'm wit all that
Dumb shit I done did all that
The [?] said teach the kids to trap
Don't know where I'll be if I didn't rap
Or if I didn't go down
The [?] with a strap (Yea)
Swear I'm paranoid to this day
Don't never bring them
Hoes where I stay
For my niggas
I go out my way
If I wasn't getting it
Would she fuck with me? I can't say

[Hook]
(4x)

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
(Well)
I remember being broke
Like it was yesterday
If you not with me trying to eat
Than let's go our separate ways
How the fuck y'all niggas chill
When y'all behind on bills?
I made enough to take a break
And I'm grinding still
I don't know how to relax
You probably never relate
I got the world on my shoulders
But I can handle the weight
And you just a casualty
If you stand in my way
I want everything I earned
And it ain't up for debate
I seen things that I care not to repeat
I count money to my babies
While I rock them to sleep
I would tell you to come get me
But I'm out of your reach
I paid the cost to boss up
And I got the receipts
I got choppas galore
I got ammo in bulk
All black in this bitch you would think
I was part of a cult
If I don't go and get it
Than it was only my fault
I know the struggle and I owe
No one to nothing at all (Godspeed)

[Hook]
(4x)

[Verse 3: Starlito & Don Trip]
[Starlito]
I remember when I was fucked up
These niggas pretending like I lucked up
They will rather see with a sentence
Somewhere locked up
Hot because I went
And got my stock up
Try anybody not us
Pockets stuff that's why
I keep that Glock tucked
[Don Trip]
Shooting like a shooting star
For our bucks
You step any closer
Fuck around and get star struck
Permit in the mail
Shooter collect the shells
Been thru way too much
I don't trust nothing but my scale
[Starlito]
Speaking of way too much
I bust a bail to all 1-12s
Hustle by myself
I can tell that I won't tell
[Don Trip]
I see the picture clear
I'm bout to hang it on a nail
So I can look at it
Remind myself I been thru hell
Don't plan on going back
To catching packets in the mail
But I still polly with my plug
In case all else fails
[Starlito]
I still holla at my thugs
When they call me from jail
Last time shit got ugly
For me, y'all weren't there (Remember)

[Hook]
(4x)
