Me & You Both

LITO
It seems like fake ass rap beef at an all time high
Everybody got guns, nigga, why nobody die?
I ain’t advocatin violence but ima ride bout mine
Catch you slippin and sliding, you be high all the time
My role models are street niggas, and they all got sentences
They tell me stay focused mentally, and channel my energy
And if a pussy nigga play wit you then handle that instantly
Just make sure there ain't no cameras in the vicinity
I come from jumping out rentals bustin, fuck nigga I been a G
Used to prey on my enemies now I pray for serenity
I just been stacking this paper working on my patience and inner peace
Pour a 5 in my lemonade, 45 with me lemon squeeze

TRIP
.45 with me lemon squeeze
If its beef, call me jimmy dean
Temper short as Nate Robinson clip as long as a limousine
Oh how im so addicted to dope, theres no remedy
If the coppers knew what I got in my trunk they would sentence me

CHORUS
They be printing new money everyday
And they burn old money everyday
So what that tell you?
It’s enough for me and you both x2
Fuck another nigga gotta hate me fo
Nigga its enough money for me and you both
X2

TRIP
Out her still wit it, toss a grenade down your chimney
‘Tween the worst shit and syphalus, yup, that’s where you’ll find sympathy
I’ll never tweet you back, I’ll attack if you mention me
Ain't nothing but dealers and killers in my vicinity
If you call it ballin, then you belong in the Pee wee league
I been at it consecutive in the game like I’m A.C Green
That 4-5 on me faithfully, please be careful don’t play with me
I’ll follow you patiently and learn your day-to-day routine
Ill find out where your lady sleeps, who you visit each day this week
Catch you in yo car at the carwash, you dead for you turn the key
Last thing you want is beef
I take shit overboard
My young niggas wylin too,They got choppers on hoverboards

LITO
Choppers on hoverboards, wait like soulja boy?
One thing for sure when we do dirt, man we don’t record it
You put your sack on the gram
I was too busy stackin up grands
Stackin these benjamins I just continue to run through the jacksons and grants

CHORUS
They be printing new money everyday
And they burn old money everyday
So what that tell you?
It’s enough for me and you both x2
Fuck another nigga gotta hate me fo’
Nigga its enough money for me and you both
X2
