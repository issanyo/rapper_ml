[Intro: OneRepublic sample]
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby, I've been, I've been praying hard

Hood rich, bitch!

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Anxiety overwhelms me (sometimes), nothing settles me
She whispers in my ear gently, stop lettin' it upset me
Devils get up off of me, devils get up off of me!
Just listen to these raps in case you never get to talk to me
Everything is not for everybody, this is effortless
Yet thoughtfully composed, it's from the soul
Those who know me best would all agree
I'd like to thank, each and every one of you that bought my CD or MP3
I'm a different breed, I promise this is me
I ain't trippin' on what's not meant for me
But confidentially, I'm plottin' to take what's mine eventually
Just grindin', nevermind (and it may not be what we want)
Any-who, I ain't them
I'm not one of the many who, flex about what they finna do
Fuck I look like, hustlin' for some tennis shoes?
You're defenseless when you're the defendant and the lawyer too expensive to represent you
Not to mention that your rent is due
Ooh, who would of thought it?
If you knew that brick would a came with conspiracy, you wouldn't of bought it
Nigga, I'm as cool as always, truly ballin'
Blew so much green, nigga Duke to Boston
Run it back like Tavon Austin..

[Repeat verse up this point]

[Verse 1 (continued after repeat): Starlito]
Straight up out the streets, we had dreams of being Rayful Edmond
And they crossin', just like Rafer Alston
I done seen some sick shit (I done seen some sick shit)
My thoughts so often make me nauseous
Blame the way that I was brought up
Made mistakes that made me cautious
Aw shit, forgive me if I lost you
I'm standin' in the booth, feel like I'm kneelin' at the altar
Pray for me, please
Pray for me, please
Pray for me, please
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me..
