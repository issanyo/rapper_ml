[Verse 1]
They say I couldn’t rap about being broke no more
They ain’t say I couldn’t rap about hope no more
Look I’m counting it up and counting down
You on your way home
Just wanted to rap with you real quick, play this in your headphones
I just been staying sucker free, just like you told me
Stacking it up and staying out the way
Tryna duck the police
Lil homie want me to send him a pack, but I ain’t on that
Cause lately I been giving out racks that I don’t want back
They busting my head on income tax, but that’s a good thing
I’m buying lots, tryna flip me some houses, man fuck the dope game
Tryna keep up with these niggas will drive you insane
I ain’t tryna please none of these niggas, I’m tryna maintain
If you ever need something from me nigga, you know I’m there man
And if I don’t answer I’m sleeping or on the airplane
Yeah I’m living better but you was there when I lost everything
Everything, niggas can share money and we shared pain
From sharing clothes to champagne
Running up them racks I’m on a rampage
You my motivation, I never heard you complain
I hate when I miss that call
I never say it man, I miss my dogs
Ever since you been gone shit been different dog
Niggas won’t even ride unless it's a bitch involved
What happened to the G code?
Swear these niggas playing the game with cheat codes
I ain’t got time for these hoes
On my grind 24, nigga, beast mode
Lito
