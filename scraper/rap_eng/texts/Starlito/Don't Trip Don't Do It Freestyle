[Verse 1]
Don’t do it don’t
Ain’t no telling which cashier I’m on
Ran into a fence it’s been too long
I took the road less travelled on with no navi I’m just trying to find my home
All my weapons are army grade the ATF won’t confiscate
I moved up out the hood, yes I’m eating but
All my problems ain’t gone away
I come from hiding like 20 pounds in momma’s house in the laundry room
Call my sh*t a home office I was getting oh my mom thought I was going to school
Well college oh sorry I’m so sorry I’m not ashamed
She worked so hard and still lost it all
No Tylenol is going to stop the pain
Wonder how am I not insane
Heart cold enough to host hockey games
Stay on track don’t interfere
Ever seen what happen you try to stop a train
Make me crash out pull that act out
AK harry send a medic I’m on the edge it’s been a minute
Still ain’t shooting like JJ Redick
Type of sh*t that give nightmares to Freddy
This words a beast that came out her belly
Balling out me and my brothers me and my sisters like Shirley Reggie
Hold up who you gonna do what to me cool
Pull up let’s see what it do
You know the drill like a bucket of screws the clip on my sh*t

[Hook]
Hold up who you gonna do what to me cool
Pull up let’s see what it do
You know the drill like a bucket of screws
The clip on my sh*t like a f*cking canoe

[Verse 2]
You catch the tip like we’re stuck in a hoop
I can’t let you play me got something to loose
My job ain’t finished my brothers still serving they touching the bird like duck duck  goose
From out my windows a f*cked up view
I won’t let my son go up no dough
I won’t let my daughters grow up to be strippers
The worlds on my back like a f*cking masseuse
I don’t speak a word if I don’t know the truth
I don’t say a word them f*ckers in blue
You n*ggas is pussy they get you and book it and you get the singing like Moulin Rouge
Don’t do it
She can get heated the cake out of the cooling the school of hard knocks you n*ggas is truant
Introversion step brothers 3 godspeed at peace with myself
