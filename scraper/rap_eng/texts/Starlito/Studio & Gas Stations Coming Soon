[Verse 1]
My n*gga on the run still clutching his gun
Love him like a son but can’t do much but pray for him
I’m paying for his sentence
It kind of hurt to mention it
Little homie ain’t going to touch the streets the heat is in the city
I know he a hustler I really see him getting it
N*ggas don’t respect my vision
Cause now my scheme legitimate
Smoking out on the phone just bending corners like p*ssy n*ggas think I rent it though
I was heated when you seen me
One man army ready for warfare no lieutenant
Just show me where a hundred rats
Get your four squares I’m a go get it
Back and forth to Kentucky with a load of midgets
A ten pack for my show tickets pulling up in my old six

[Verse 2]
Hold up the n*gga on the run who you was talking about
That’s the same n*gga the show promoter was arguing about
Second guessing finessing grab the rod and he rode em out
Car in front of the house anything attempting walking out
Plenty men get extensions go fill it with it be intention
Get the blick and the biscuit you flinch you gone get the business
Certified thirst for the grind work in the ride
Asking nobody for nothing you do it murder your pride
Women I have been with ten to flirt with the eyes
Deception by different methods a smile’s a perfect disguise
Momma taught me can’t be no hoe Captain Kirk on the side
Laughing ducking and trapping at first you thought I was blind

[Verse 3]
Look up wise and said Anna with Lito you getting knocked off
Leave a n*gga in Tennessee licking Louisiana hot sauce
Prolly think we just popping sh*t and not really my box
Tell the others in your front yard to block your whole block off
Left out the spot looking like I just got my rocks on
With a bad b*tch and a bag full of rocks and straight out the doctors office
I don’t know what you thought I would bother not to talk
But I got to tell you that I just bought a car better not talk
Out of town free brand and bee tow
Private eyes watch what you drive out the casino
Ding dong politely and pop you right through the peep hole
Lot of pounds allowed to if it weren’t prolly for Lito
Highway in our cars
Haul it off in the smarts
Shorty will be here shortly
I’m starting to call her Bart
Neck reminds me of Marge and she eat it from out the shorts
My life is tall in the mall copping collars as if I go
Follow that’s what I thought impala
Don’t know what they problem is but got too many dollars
And the lotto so I prolly won’t stop it until I own it
That strap got one in the hole cause somebody just shot my dog
Before I got myself involved

[Verse 4]
Rocking republic republican wish you a bunch of luck
If you love f*cking your publicist
Metaphorically speaking about to hammer
Tragic defamation of character equal damage
Can’t sleep for the peeping the cameras
Keep having dreams of them people beeping in on the scanner
I’ve been creeping to Atlanta
Play p*ssy heater the leader panther
Brought up in the streets I was taught to squeeze automatics
Three in the liter these are just how I have it
Studios and gas stations if not you catch us in traffic
