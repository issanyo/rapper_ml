5 0'Clock in the mornin, where ya gonna be?
Outside on the corner

[Starlito]
Still in these streets
(its me, lito)

Still in these streets
I ain't braggin bout it
Scrapin scrappin hustlin
Tryna rap about it
Thats about it
Respect is somethin you gotta earn
Better ask em bout me
Always workin after hours
Thats why i be cashin out

I wait until they paint the wheels and squad it on them forges, bring it out (SKERT)
Been beefin since the last time them jordans came out (damn)
Shots from the 40 rang out fuck whoever important to them
Before i ever went on tour i was in and out the courtroom
2 car garage, condo got bout 4 rooms
Truck on them things, inside bigger than a dorm room
Closet look like Nordstrom
Im ballin, ballin, ballin, ho
Get off my line dont call my phone
You KNOW im tryna get off these O's!
On my p's and q's
Im talkin dro thats all i know
Thats all i smoke
L-leanin i won't fall off, doe
Nope
Signed my self, im doin so well
No thank you, i dont need no help
Just did a show last night, looks like i caught a half a kilo sale
Lito get his weed on sale
Thats dirt cheap, that OG, that sour d
For the larry b
Get it gone like magic
Voila, why lie, its gone, bye bye, for the high high
For the 45 got a .45, do that 20 times you make 25

Still in these streets
I ain't braggin bout it
Scrapin scrappin hustlin
Tryna rap about it
Thats about it
Respect is somethin you gotta earn
Better ask em bout me
Always workin after hours
Thats why i be cashin out
