Resentment, knows no bounds
Shut the Fuck up!

[Hook: Blaze Burna, Starlito]
Man that shit crazy, Haters twisting up they faces
Talking reckless from safe places
Acting like its something wrong with me
Wrong with me
Acting like its something wrong with me

AYE homie whats wrong with you?

[Verse 1: Starlito]

Now I don't love her, we just going through the motions
Emotions and so much so i used emoticons when i wrote this
Shopping for a low key spot, i need a garage
Told shorty if she want to keep me, then we need to MÃ©nage
I know I'm selfish as fuck, still grinding I'm on my job
Heard I've been balling to hard, now I'm the nigga to rob
I'm laughing like hahaha, getting a 90 minute massage
P90 right in my lining and I won't hold my applause
Mac 90 ya with the clips tape, drop a nigga like a mixtape
Im stuck in the 90s, remind ya of MC Eiht
Like like, aye homie you need some help
Got the money for reinforcements but rather do it myself
Yall ain't gone do shit but tell
Ain't gone shoot shit cept for your self
Fuck rap, i been catching sales
These niggas been paying 12
Who got it, na fuck it, I ain't shopping with no new niggas
That's how they got homie damn,just trying to make a profit
Who said what? Rap diss, get that ass touched up
Squeeze a nigga out till he hush up
Tough ass nigga turn to usher about some pressure
Better vest up, put a rap nigga on a stretcher yes sir
Real niggas in attendance for all my lectures
I just hope you been paying attention taking notes all semester
If you dont cut the bullshit out, boy you better, na im better
Paint wetter, fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch the same day I met her
I dont want her if i can't wed her

Man that shit crazy, Haters twisting up they faces
Talking reckless from safe places
Acting like its something wrong with me
Wrong with me
Acting like its something wrong with me

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
Check 1, 2 what it do (run it)

They really hate me bad
Cause a nigga on really make you mad
When i pull up in a slab that will make you sad
But if i was doing bad that would make you glad
I just want a bag, make that cash, stack up Keith Sweat make that last
Like Too Short, gotta make that fast, so I'm heading to the bank gotta make that pass
Get a little bread before i switch on a nigga, run to the laws, go snitch on a nigga
Try to set you up, put a bitch on a nigga, price on ya head, put a hit on a nigga
Jealous and envy, yall boys sinning, grown as men acting like women
Being fake cool? yall niggas winning? fucking up the game, ain't no more innings
Hate to see my ball like Jennings, and i keep a bad bitch laying in my linens
While you niggas frowning and a real nigga grinning, somewhere with a sack, going in spending
Yall need help, God bless you niggas, hating on me won't bless you nigga
Crazy how my life really stress you nigga, but it ain't my job to impress you nigga
No ambition, no hustle, no grind
Ray ban niggas tryna block my shine
Steal a nigga watch, trying to stop my time
So I show no mercy when I cock that iron
Holding your head, Im killing these niggas
Ain't no body real, really feeling these niggas
Face all twisted, grilling me nigga
Here's a colt 45, im Billy D nigga Bang

Man that shit crazy, Haters twisting up they faces
Talking reckless from safe places

Wrong with me
Acting like its something wrong with me
