[Verse]
Freedom ain't free
You think you got rights 'til they read 'em and you weep
Forty G's in a week, legal fees ain't cheap
And these demons get deep, nah he ain't been asleep
Still been handling business, and keeping my receipts
If we ain't talking money ain't no need for us to speak
Shoppin' sprees ain't free, coppin' pleas ain't me
I'm in the streets and your apology's too discreet
What was you saying online? that'll get handled no time
Next door at your front door like it's Amazon Prime
I been trying to clear my mind and think better thoughts
Ignore all of the noise and just let 'em talk
Tellin' me and I just took the loss
Listen dog, jealousy gon nail me to the cross
Lookin' all stupid due to loyalty
Truthfully I wanted to see you win probably more than me
My biggest flaw my big heart, and it's been broke a few times
It either fuck with your psyche, yeah or it open your mind
Motherfuckers don't like me, and you know what that's fine
You can keep your two cents, I don't owe you a dime
I'm just tryna stay (free), what I'm tryna say, grind 'til I find a way
Way too busy showing love, I ain't got time to hate
We can kick it but I'm thuggin', I ain't tryna date
I'm tryna get it, I pull up but it might be kinda late, when I'm free
I don't sleep, if I don't hustle, I don't eat
Ever since a young boy I don't go nowhere without that iron on me
Wait for the drought then we hit 'em with a finder's fee
Still will run the spot hot soon as she signed the lease
Free my homies, yeah lately I been lonely
In a room full of familiar faces but don't nobody know me
Only time I'm focused when they say I'm antisocial
You'd fake an iron too if I just play like I ain't notice
Free Kevin Gates, I wish he was out to celebrate
His two year anniversary on Gucci Mane's wedding day
I meditate, never hesitate
I can't wait 'til all my homies get out
