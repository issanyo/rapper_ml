[Verse 1]
Dope money, fuck that I want some real money
I’m tryna build something, not worry bout you stealing from me
Still thugging, I carry out but I got a mil coming
My carry on got 30 bands in it, that’s real money
She don’t how I fucks her till I pass out, I don’t feel nothing
It’s still a [?] if you spill something (fuck!)
I lost count, skipped town, and they thought about it
Still got it on me, rather get caught with it then caught without it
Yeah my president is black, my bankroll blue
Gave half of my life to this rap shit, bust my gun too
Lost most of my friends, bought some more and a Benz
Pay off my partner’s lawyer as soon as I sell these rims
Say you want to test the waters, bought to mail me a ten
So fucked up I might go missing, never hear from me again
One thing about lick money, look how fast it’s spent
Meanwhile, sending [?] to the pen
Yeah, getting loaded with all this paper on me
In the HOV lane all by my lonely
Doing a dollar in that Vette, tryna make it go 200
And it’s only, you don’t want no problems
Yeah I’m in the Trilluminati
Me, Gates, Trip, Dolph, and Yo Gotti
So throwed off I don’t talk with nobody
Lito
