I need a a blunt of da killer just to get me through the day
I need a a blunt of da killer just to get me through the day
I need a a blunt of da killer just to get me through the day
I need a a blunt of da killer just to get me through the day

[Verse 1: Scotty ATL]
I gotta mean hand, nigga chef Scot I scraping whipping up the pot
I thank the lord for everything I got, I know they plotting waiting for my spot
Working a 16 for a knot, think you gone come up on me boy you not
They gave they best I took it up a notch, white letters tires cutlass wit the knock
You just don't come around like you used to, how you blame it on me
Can’t get G’s if you Z, sacrificing no sleep, member trapping out the jeep 
County lines county lines
Niggas all in my business
Counting mines counting mines
I needa blunt of da killa, rolling dem woods out the zipper
Yo girl be pulling my zipper, reach in my pocket to tip her
Bring in da packs and we flip em, take me a trip to the west west
Ball on dey ass like a Clipper, pass dat shit Lito, I hit it

[Hook: Scotty ATL]
I need a a blunt of da killer just to get me through the day
I need a a blunt of da killer just to get me through the day
I need a a blunt of da killer just to get me through the day
I need a a blunt of da killer just to get me through the day

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I fuck around and smoke the whole zip, day 2 of this road trip
My bitch sending me stress messages, always bringing up old shit My lil homie caught a homicide, bruh just sent me the news clip Everyday its some new shit, I came to the conclusion that karma’s real
Just lost my lighter you don't know how i feel riding solo in my automobile, getting high as fuck that's how I chill
I ran it up and cleaned it up now I pay everybody bills, they might be taking me for granted I don't know shit probably is
My conscious keep on fucking wit me, went and bought another semi
Feel safer out of town even though I love my city
Been on both sides of a drive by, pain and pride I can’t hide mine Ain't ashamed to cry but sometimes i just roll up and be like fuck this shit!
