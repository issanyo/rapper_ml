[Intro: Morgan Freeman & (Monica Potter)]
You do what you are
(You mean you are what you do)
No, I mean...you do what you are
You're born with a gift
If not that, then you get good at something along the way
And what your good at, you don't take for granted
You don't betray it
(What if you do, betray your gift?)
Then you betray yourself

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Don't sell yourself short
That's a short stroll from selling your soul
I recently found myself, it's time to set some new goals
Forget some new clothes, Rolexes and gold, flexing for hoes
I'm talking about freeing ya mind 'bout time you let some shit go
Post traumatic stress since adolescence
I was at war with myself,  but that was lessons
Those is blessings just to learn from my mistakes and live to tell it, no confession
Able to make a stable living off my self expression, I'm guessing
My haters didn't think I manifested
When I was trapped in the trap
Is how I planned an exit
Got to playing with weapons getting that weight off like I'm anorexic
On the other hand shit wasn't right, so I left like I'm ambidextrous
I had places in Vegas, Phoenix, Atlanta, Texas
Heard people say I'm the greatest, a genius, and a legend
They say my insomnia comes from antidepressants
Voices telling me grind hard, don't abandon your message

[Hook: Y. Lee]
See the game don't wait for no one
You do what you are
Whether you are on the top or the bottom 'long as you go get your dolla

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I ain't slept right in 14 years, I'm dead serious
Finally came face to face with my fears, praying in a mirror
Lot of times I just be thinking out loud that way I hear it
Lot of rap niggas really be cowards
I say they're weird
Portraying and playing roles
Ain't real as they appear
Really was in them streets so they feel this shit in they spirit
Shots fired, I was shooting and shooting back
Where they do that at?
Anywhere, anytime, call it on sight
Better keep ya gat
I was beefin' for 6 months straight
I ain't even rap
Never left the Eastside neither
No sleep (?)
Took a year to get my bankroll right
But never stopped grinding hard, petty, learned my lesson
Call it perfect timing
Nah, I'm not just rhyming

[Hook: Y. Lee]
You see the game don't wait for no one
You do what you are
Whether you are on the top or the bottom 'long as you go get your dolla
