[Intro-Jack Freeman]
Mmhhmmm yeah, yeah everyday, everyday, everyday

[Chorus-Jack Freeman]
Everyday is a different something (Its a different something)
So I sit low in this diver seat puffin on this haze (puffin on this haze)
Cause everyday a nigga tripping homie (yeahhh)
But it ain't a lot to say when you getting money, gotta pay attention (too much money)
Cause everyday is a different something, I know you trying to get paid but I ain't giving nothing
Trippin  ain't the game
I got plans, can't keep seatin on (yeahhh) em
I ain't got time to (Lito-Aghhh) waste way niggas flippin
Gotta stay the same (ooohoo)

[Verse 1-Starlito]
Look We got bills to pay
A nigga I grew up with just got killed today, but what else is new
You live and you learn, forever, school
It ought to hurt, how I be telling the truth
We never got money, we never was cool
The law so hot, swear I get stopped every time I leave my house
They search me, he found some money on me I ain't even count
Threw my refer out, the heater I got on me legal now
He lied told me I was speeding, I agree and smile
High profile, get high, get profiled ridin low pro ties
I'm Kobe Bryantt, but I got that 45
You come for me, then we both dying
Man I come from the East side were we gon ride
No prize, ours was on the stove cookin dope on four eyes
Grinding harder even put that on my credit card
Excuse me Debby got some cash put up for a charge
Need further information, refer to my first bark
Ain't the worst part, pistol on me like look a birth mark
Its Lito

[Chorus-Jack Freeman]
Everyday is a different something (Its a different something)
So I sit low in this diver seat puffin on this haze (puffin on this haze)
Cause everyday a nigga tripping homie (yeahhh)
But it ain't a lot to say when you getting money, gotta pay attention (too much money)
Cause everyday is a different something, I know you trying to get paid but I ain't giving nothing
Trippin  ain't the game (Killa-Yeah)
I got plans, can't keep seatin on (yeahhh) em  (Killa-show me one of them mfrs I know everybody)
I ain't got time to (Lito-Aghhh) waste way niggas flippin
Gotta stay the same (ooohoo)

[Verse 2-Killa Kyleon]
Why you niggas hate me, simply cause you ain't me
Real nigga, one the, something that you can't be
Maybe it must be this bread, something that you can't see
Y'all niggas worse than the kkk, you grand dragons that ain't cheap
@'ing me on my twitter page, and my Instagram, and my comments cause I'm turned up and they turned down
But I don't reply to the dumb shit
No life, no life y'all fuck niggas got no life
Wake up hatin, before you brush mouth
They main focus is your life
Get caught, turn state, now they helping out po lights
You niggas might say I'm pussy cats, that's that shit I don't like
Cheefin, keefin, my swisher sweet
Never fake cause I keep it street
Lets talk money, I stay quiet
If I have to, I keep it brief
Talk cheap and these niggas broke than a mother fucker
Now I'm the suspect,  I hate I spoke to you mother fuckers
Keep my distance, might fuck with most of you mother fuckers
But tell the valet don't put me close to you mother fuckers

[Chorus-Jack Freeman]
Everyday is a different something (Its a different something)

Cause everyday is a different something, I know you trying to get paid but I ain't giving nothing
