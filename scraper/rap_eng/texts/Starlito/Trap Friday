[Intro]
Trap Saturday, Trap Sunday, Trap
Trap Monday, Trap Jumpin'
Hello, pull up

[Verse 1: Starlito]
That ridin round servin shit spooky meet me at the spot
Pull up by yourself, make sure you call before you knock
I gotta get this other camera fixed, I thought you was the ops
Just bought lil cuz a Glock, and yeah its always one in the top
Strapped like a fuckin car cd on them roxies
Addicted to prescription narcotics
Yeah since they shot him
He just want somebody to feel how he feel about it
Getting it and really bout it
Still willing to kill about it
Mixed a mill for the profit
Imma get me a couple thousand
Might just call up my old bitch
I been feelin nostalgic
Used to serve out of rentals
Wartime we tint 'em
And isotal in the cabinet
Quiet 9 by the blender
My nigga we really havin it
All my pockets got cash in it
Really just need one real bitch
All the thots you can have 'em
'Member I when was fucked up
Bought a spot and a magnum
And I ain't never looked back
And naw I'm not even braggin
But ever since then
If I wanted I had it
Or I grinded till I got it (Grind Hard)
Yeah you know how I'm rockin
Ever since then
If I wanted I had it
Or I grinded till I got it
Grind Hard Lito!

[Chorus: Red Dot]
Me and my niggas get it gone soon as that pack arrive
We gon need so many cards for them lil black Verizons
Everybody tryna shop like it's black Friday
Keep a line of around the spot call it Trap Friday

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I swear I love all my haters when I'm showing out
Homie just got out - 10 years paper, I'm bout to smoke him out
I gotta choppa in my car, yeah, yo' hoe can vouch
And you can give that bitch your heart but I just want the mouth
You put emoji's under her pictures, I prolly flown her out
Told her don't post it, Ion want no one to know about it
They asked me where I got these kicks
But nah they don't come out
Don't ask me where I got this stick shit I just stole some pounds
Blowing up my phone talking bout I owe him, how?
Ha, I gave him all ones
You should've brought your gun
You took a loss, we won
And it ain't cost me nothin
And for that free smoke
We be on your street dumpin

[Chorus: Red Dot]
Me and my niggas get it gone soon as that pack arrive
We gon need so many cards for them lil black Verizons
Everybody tryna shop like it's black Friday
Keep a line of around the spot call it Trap Friday
Me and my niggas get it gone soon as that pack arrive
We gon need so many cards for them lil black Verizons
Everybody tryna shop like it's black Friday
Keep a line of around the spot call it Trap Friday
