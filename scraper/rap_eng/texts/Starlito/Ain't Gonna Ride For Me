[Verse 1]
No grudges, just blessings
No losses, just lessons
No talking, just listen
Get caught, no confession
I was destined, I was bred to not regret shit
I forgive you, I don't forget shit
You was real 'til you did that shit
I always say it's the things that you never say that cause the problems
Say what's on your mind so we can solve it
That he say she say you heard from so-and-so on whatchamacallit
Really got in your head, now you in your feelings and it's fuckin' up all this, ah

[Chorus]
When you tell me that you love me, I don't think too much of it
Ain't sayin' it don't mean nothin', but you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't gon' ride for me, you ain't gon' ride for me, for me
Thought this was for forever, for you I do whatever
You ain't gon' ride for me, you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't gon' ride for me, for me

[Verse 2]
No patience, just passion
No question, just askin'
I never imagined you let this shit happen
You happy? I'm just askin'
I can't even get past it
I'm just laughin' to keep from cryin', mad that I even tried
Blame it on me and pride 'cause I'd rather not speak my mind
Whether I leave or lie, and I don't want either, why
Probably in denial, thinkin' that we can try
No sleep since I dreamed I died, I might not go outside
I'm really hurt inside, torn and I can't decide
They love me, they hate me, respect me, they fear me, all at the same time
And I don't know much but I know who ain't gon' ride

[Chorus]
When you tell me that you love me, I don't think too much of it
Ain't sayin' it don't mean nothin', but you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't gon' ride for me, you ain't gon' ride for me, for me
Thought this was for forever, for you I do whatever
You say you doin' better, but you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't gon' ride for me, you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't gon' ride for me, for me

[Outro]
One day it started rainin', and it didn't quit
