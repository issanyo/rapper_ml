Y'all motherfuckers must hate for a living
But face it, it's business
Besides that, you ain't making a difference
You ain't gotta be a scientist to major in Physics
'Cause beef in the streets is like basic addition
16 from the 9, I bet your face'll be sizzling
And this ain't breakfast, but you'll be tasting a biscuit
Make you part from the earth like Mase did religion
Get down or lay down, fucker, make a decision
Got every small child out making a wish list
'Cause they see me handing out cane, they thinking it's Christmas
You niggas mad 'cause I'm taking your bitches
Good D and hard work, they think I play for the Pistons
'Cause I'm the Prince, from now on call me Tayshaun
Hey, naw naw Fate, bring it back, where the bass gone
Now everybody like I bet that he will blow
'Cause my advance check is looking like that Beverly Hills show

[Hook x2]
It's All-Star, I'm the Prince of the Ville
I laid out my blueprint in the Ville
And I ain't even gotta mention the deal
What, y'all ain't convinced that I'm real

Cheap price, yeah, that's what got me the chrome spinning
I'm nineteen, but three years been fucking with grown women
For three years, I been hustling, zone dealing
They say money make you heartless and I ain't got no feelings
If the sun up, my top down, you know, no ceilings
Been getting bread so long, it's starting to mold, really
I know I'm so silly, blame it on the dough
I'm the fresh prince of the ville, I'm like the old Willy
Hustle hard, yeah, but I'm stunting still
I said I'm getting banks like Hillary, spitting shit that my Uncle feel
And my pockets fat like Uncle Phil
But I'm always watching my back, stay on my toes like pumps and heels
Treat you like a gas station, fill you with a pump for real
Or cut your face and let you see just how a pumpkin feel
I dump the steel on the punk who squeals, young and real
I leave your relatives crying like it was some onions pealed
I got onions, pills, pills, onions, x, and coke
Techs and scopes, plenty green and I ain't talking vegetables
Never scared, better yet, bitch, I'm never broke
Some of y'all rappers would do a better job telling jokes
'Cause y'all remind me of Comic View
I'll leave you ducked off in a hole the same way Osama do
I'll leave your family ducked tape, even your mama too
If you think I'm going too far, you don't know about drama dude
Get the work out, I'll remind you of Jane Fonda dude
The way you niggas on my dick, y'all ain't giving the condom room
I know this verse long, don't worry, I'ma be stopping soon
You waiting on Street Ball, don't worry, it's gon' dropping soon
If I had my way, shit, it'' probably drop in June
First, I need to pay my way through the game, I need a lot of room
I got a lot of weight, could fill up a locker room
That's why they call me the All-Star, fucker, get your weight up
