[Talking]
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know
Might be too personal. Might be too personal. Might be too personal
I don't know. It's over. Just personality
Ahhhh!

[Hook]
I think about you all the the time
No, I can't get you off my mind (I can't get you off my mind)
But you can't get me off my grind
I can't get over you
But you can't get me off my grind
I'm so in love with you...

[Verse 1]
This much is true...
No matter what I do or where I go
I see your face, hallucinate
Meet a stranger, call her your name
I feel this way, I'm not ashamed
My selfish ways are all to blame
I swear I was so full of shit
Played so many games, I'm in the hall of fame
I'm lonely
Need company
Miserable
It's all the same
I tried to call, your number changed
I told you, I was gonna change
Should've gave her four letters
TIME, LOVE, a NAME
I tried to call, your number changed
I told you, I was gonna change

[Hook] 2x
I think about you all the the time
No, I can't get you off my mind (I can't get you off my mind)
But you can't get me off my grind
I can't get over you
But you can't get me off my grind
I'm so in love with you...

[Verse 2]
I think about you when I'm out'chere
Grinding, tryna find myself
I think about the times you tried to help
Still wound up by myself
Forgot about the way I truly felt
Because I was overwhelmed
I'm moving on with no regrets
That U-Haul truck ain't showed up yet
Can't get over it
And what's worse I can't control it
She say we just friends
That ain't enough
Things just ain't the same no more
This feeling's unexplainable
This picture had to get painted though
And I could only used the color blue
What should I do?
What would you do?

[Hook] 2x
I think about you all the the time
No, I can't get you off my mind (I can't get you off my mind)
But you can't get me off my grind
I can't get over you
But you can't get me off my grind
I'm so in love with you...


I'm so in love with you...
