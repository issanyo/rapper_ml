[Hook x3]
Who am I? Young rich nigga
What I do? Buy the whole bar
What I got? Cocaine white
That's why I'm an All-Star

They call me All-Star, I'm playing to win
And I ain't Mike Jones, I ain't gon' say it again
I ain't here to try to make any friends
I let my watch talk for me, it's yelling "Adrian"
My wrist rocky, get it, my wrist Rocky
A bit cocky, but fuck it, you can't stop me
You can't hold me, the youngest of the OG's
High profile, could beat a case like Kobe
Fuck it, I'm going back to the old me
Plus, I'm still spending mixtape money from '03
Talk your ass off, you would never approach me
Niggas read a couple magazines and think they know me
Picture me no bars, hooks, or no beats
Still find me wherever the hoes be, Oh he's
So street and can still get the coke cheap
Niggas don't wanna see me like they owe me, you know me

[Hook x3]

I'm straight from the gutter, I stay with the butter
And that purple and yellow lean, that's the Laker's colors
If you need white crack, I'll be right back
Next time you see me, I'll be with the Heat like Shaq
Even without the T, I'm still a Mac, so
Call me McGrady, I'm coming for your lady
Fuck is wrong with these niggas, they going crazy
See, everybody's a rapper, the difference is they pay me
I'm a veteran, was born in the 80s
I even made money off the Roc like Jay-Z
So please get off my dick
It's too many hoes on it already, you won't fit
You can't walk in my footprints, man, the shoe don't fit
I'm arrogant like I grew up rich, naw, I just blew up quick
Niggas hate me cause they hoes want me
And I'm starting to think this shit really grows on trees

[Hook x3]

Who am I? Young rich nigga, gangsta as I wanna be
Who are you? Dumb snitch nigga, wanksta you a wannabe
The difference is niggas hate me cause the hoes love it
I'm like, I'm ain't gonna stop what I'm doing man, so fuck it
Think I ain't gangster cause we on TV man
Niggas houses will still get shot up in like BG's veins
It's real, say what I feel and let niggas respond
Jumped in the game with a buzz about as big as Lebrons
Before rap, I was never broke, believe me
Now I'm a Star, you need a telescope to see me
It's Young Rell, Paper, and Fate, my boys with me
Call it what you want mother fucker, it's loyalty
