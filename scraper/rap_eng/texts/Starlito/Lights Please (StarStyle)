Make-up sex the only reason for her attitude
I'm thankful that she's horizontal, gratitude--latitude
We had a lot in common, She went to fashion school
I was tryna establish a clothing but then, rappings cool
Do what you have to do, sometimes you gotta shoot
For the moon, just to reach the stars, isn't that logical?
We'll take a Veneta, Ya, and that Prada too
I must acknowledge that I rarely ever come out my shoes
She got brains, and me bein' a scholar too
When she say "player" she gets no attention and the "two's"
She so fly, but so nympho-like
Bimbo-like, still get kimbo slice, CUT
Boyfriend number 3, her friends don't like
Tell them hoes to get a life, and then go dyke
For the opinions that they cast on your relationship
From my perspective its perceived to be some hater shit
He on the latest shit, "Oo girl he make me sick"
99 problems but not one of em a bitch
99 like roca wear fragrance is
99 I had my quarter ounce at 26
Know what that mean, them jordans are too nice
Catch her wild, hope she gimme the green light
I think she love me, thats what it seem like
By 04 I was livin my dream life
Well sort of..smokin out the QP
When we would role play, she'd act like a groupie
Paint a picture, rap like a movie
Perhaps I'll call my new CD, "Truthfully"
Or "The songs that I wrote between catchin' planes"
Or "Jesus just died and this the second day"
Or "Bye, its been real, I ain't never fake"
Or "Leave me the fuck alone, I got a headache"
Any of these would be appropriate to re-appropriate
The morals that these rappers have destroyed
Ya show em the way
Their flows couldn't go toe to toe with my throw aways
Im in need of a light please, as J. Cole would say
I just copped an oz, Ima blow this whole O today
And because I'm so inspired I might do a whole tape
White widow, black mistress, rosay
We do it twice on slow days and take smoke breaks
Grind hard, I told you we were just alike
See I'm Star, and I'm talkin bout this chick I like
I know people don't really listen but if you wonderin'
Every time we finish sexin' she say come again
Ya she fine, ya she sexy, on a 1-10
Scale she a 110, ass out stomach in
I role over like, "I want you to meet my mom and them"
"Thats cool but when Im gonna meet stunna and them?"
Huh?

[Starlito Talking]
I ain't gonna lie, she was so fine I was like...shit, tomorrow?
