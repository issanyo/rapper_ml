Baby fever its Lito, Lito..
Hot Chicken
I mean if i'm in my feelings then I'm just in my feelings you gotta feel something to know you're alive right?

[Verse]
Just lost 11 hundred dollars on a buzzer beater (fuck)
Another band to make his bond, I'm my brother's keeper
Another band on yo baby momma, I don't love her neither
But on another note I got baby fever
They're trying to gentrify rap (for real)
And I been in my I been in my I been in my feelings for a while now..
(that's not necessarily a bad thing)
Damn near a millionaire and yeah I really want a child now
They're trying to  gentrify rap and I can't censor the facts
Just keep ya image intact, make sure to mention you trap
Let them benjamins stack, you get a sentence for that
One of my friends coming back (welcome home) just did a ten yeah he flattened
He say 'Star, I see you shining but why you ain't got no kids?'
I ain't have nothing to say.. fuck it, bring back the bridge
I been in my feelings for awhile now..

Nah but seriously, lately been feeling dated to say I'm an 80's baby
Kids born in 2000 will shoot you while someone tapes it
(& they don't even know what "taping" is)
I promise you I'm not crazy. I put Quanie on all my tapes and still think Lebron's underrated
Drove from Phoenix to Vegas with just three songs on my playlist
"Dear Mama" by Pac and Jay-Z's "Mama Loves Me" and "Mama I Made It"
You gotta pay me, yeah, and I been saving (GrindHard)
Here lately I been really wanting babies, so I can see a part of me that wasn't always shady
I don't trust my lady (nah) she a product of the poison
Can't stay out her phone won't hear the message for the noise
(laughs) thats how the truth be getting distorted
Thats why I'm self employed, don't rent go get a mortgage
They trained us to destroy shit they brainwashed me before
The world gone still spin when you ain't coppin them Jordan's
You better be investing while you slanging all that boy (H)
Cause the whole time you been hanging round a name dropping informant (wait, damn)
Thats how it be forreal (forreal)
Your brain can't even contain all this game I got for ya
Don't play the game for the haters cause they not important
Way too much opportunity waiting out here for ya
That's a waste of energy, don't waste ya time. Avoid it
At all costs.. I'll fall back before I fall off (Lito)
If these walls could talk
I really manifest destiny, this was all from a thought
I put that thought into action, I went from trappin' to rappin', forreal (GrindHard)
And I ain't going back and that's real, in a half a year made a half a mill and I ain't havin' no deal
(I'm havin' it for real)
