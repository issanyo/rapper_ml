[Verse 1: Starlito]
Look, bury me with a solid gold fire extinguisher
Look, bury me with a solid gold fire extinguisher
Really hate speaking on my death, why did you bring it up
I'm on high, I'm lean as fuck
Would have made it on tv, shout out my step bro
I'mma mess she clean it up, I don't sleep but I dreamed it bra
My team lamborghinied up
I was so wrapped up, lived fast till I'm king tut
Die young, what the fuck, why that I'm such a such
Fuck them, we bout, we eating yeah
Supper's up, sipping on this cup of punch
Lucky if I wake up for brunch, give or take a couple blunts
I'm like 80 racks up this month
Told her that I loved her once, that's cause I fucked her once
What's a king with no queen, completion Honey Gold Wings

[Hook]
Game time baby, I'm balling
I say the game so hard that it's golden
And this is real king shit that I'm talking
So when I die don't sit me in the coffin
Dip me in gold
So when I die don't sit me in the coffin
Dip me in gold
So when I die don't sit me in the coffin
Dip me in gold

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Lined up, put the grinds and the grind wait and your ?
Kind of expectations, like a blind date
I'm the exclamation point, y'all can't be serious
Quotations, leave a nigga bloody, period, no questions
Lessons for the testing when the stressing starts
She popping on the hands stand
It's lookin' like a question mark
I'm tryin' to get behind her, just whine up
I am bad, Michael Jackson in the club bad
Girl bring that ass here, show me how the head work
I ain't playing games bitch, like I was a redshirt
Bitch get the bread first, bring that back to dad
Do that a couple more times then holler back at me
Sleeping off a zany, with my fingers in her panties
Called her best friend Tammy, said you gotta meet Danny
Tongue so good, bitch you will pay for it
Now bitch get me the hours, ditching class I wait for it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Don Trip]
I said my home is a palace, just king ass nigga
Sipping success out the chalice
Got a sack and a pistol, you can say I come with baggage
She took a look at my carrots, now we're fucking like rabbits
Black on black in my carriage bitch I'm as fly as Aladdin
I got a one year old daughter so please don't call me your daddy
I'm as fresh as fabric softener. don't got no time for no static
Laser pointed for beef, but I get more green than the salad
Niggas sleeping on me still one day they'll see how I live
Meantime let's keep getting paid, sound like a decent idea
I'm as sharp as the spear, slash your face to the ear
And cut your tongue out your mouth, maybe now you can hear
I got a Glock in the vest, call that a sword and a shield
My shit ain't come with no safety, so paranoia prevails
I'm so so fresh to death, that I put my jays in my will
That way my babies can get it and when I'm gone we can kick it

Get it (X6)
