[Intro]

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Lito, I speak that lingo fluently
I told her to come through
I won't be through til 2 or 3
She ended up chewing me
But keep that between you and me
I just ran out of lean but still got way too much weed
Way too high, would you agree
I need a parachute please
Let yourself out, I wouldn't care if you leave
Said she looking for love
[?] somewhere shooting threes up in Cleveland
I'm good at not giving a fuck so fuck me good and we even
I could be your friend
Let's just say we'll have benefits
Honestly I'm in a committed relationship with the dividend
Replace a bitch with the quickness
And the H in this stand for hypocrite
BI that belligerent and significant
Man fuck this shit
Hold up
Got your bitch on call waiting
On three way with my other hoes
Like no bitch, y'all crazy
Whole zip, no swishers
Roll papers, all flavor
Drop you off, won't call you later

[Hook: Starlito]
Go bitch, I gotta go bitch
What you waiitng on
You got Uber on your phone
Is your location on
When I told your bring that ass here
Why it take so long
Love it when I scoop her up
Hate it when I take her home
Go bitch, I gotta go bitch
What you waiitng on
You got Uber on your phone
Is your location on
When I told your bring that ass here
Why it take so long
Love it when I scoop her up
Hate it when I take her home

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Andretti push pedals on a heavy Chevy
Girl you're going home even if you ain't ready
Cause I got some business to tend to
Can't pull up at this meeting with you
Came falling from the sky like confetti
Ferrari Italian, the coup's spaghetti
Full of doja floating like I'm on a Ferry, shit
Andretti push pedals on a heavy Chevy
Girl you're going home even if you ain't ready
Cause I got some business to tend to
Can't pull up at this meeting with you
Came falling from the sky like confetti
Ferrari Italian, the coup's spaghetti
Full of doja floating like I'm on a Ferry
Sharp as a [?] on my new shoes
[?] cut the bitch off
I want her one night but she tried to give me her heart
Baby girl that wasn't that smart cause
I'm only loving the paper
Trying to slow me down baby girl you a hater
Uber outside go head, I'm waiting
Why you trying to make this to a stay-cation
Isn't your cousin at your house watching your baby
Fuck her good, got her crazy
Other niggas that she fucking with [?]
Cause I'm too [?]
Anything I do like history in the fucking making
Big dog, big moves
Bitch don't you feel the world shaking
Ain't rap when I say I got the rake bitch
You can ride in it
But you're sleeping at your place, bitch

[Hook: Starlito]
Go bitch, I gotta go bitch
What you waiitng on
You got Uber on your phone
Is your location on
When I told your bring that ass here
Why it take so long
Love it when I scoop her up
Hate it when I take her home
Go bitch, I gotta go bitch
What you waiitng on
You got Uber on your phone
Is your location on
When I told your bring that ass here
Why it take so long
Love it when I scoop her up
Hate it when I take her home
