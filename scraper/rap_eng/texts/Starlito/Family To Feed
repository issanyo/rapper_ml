[Intro]
You recording?
Lito
I wanna keep all that what I said, you recorded man

[Chorus: Starlito]
I got a family to feed
Wanna plant me a lil seed
Just ran through a hundred G's
Just on gambling and weed, damn
Said he had plans to hit the league
Told him go get them bands overseas, just ball

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Free my daddy
And shoutout to my mama 'cause comin' up we ain't have it
Now I'm out on tour and sure enough she look happy
My life is really real and my raps just the re-enactment
She in a dream house, I put the lean down
Step Brothers 3 is out
Red Dot came home, I bought that Porsche soon as he got out
Wish that I could free all of my people so they can see me now
My president is peach, ayy pretty please impeach this clown
Free Roy, free Qui, free Gates (my niggas)
Seem like only yesterday I was gettin' that weed from the Bay
Stuffed a Build-A-Bear with P's and shipped that weed to my bae
When she signed for it she smiled like it's Valentine's Day
Break 'em down to one-twelve, call it peaches and cream
Big money schemes been the thing, ever since he a was a teen
See my first hundreds G's in a visa with scheme
Shots fired, I was last seen leavin' the scene, I'm gone
Lito, on my statute of limitations flow
Went from selling rocks to meeting with Roc Nation, woah
Took a lot of patience but I'm grateful though
Still don't give a fuck 'bout being famous ho

[Chorus: Starlito]
I got a family to feed
Wanna plant me a lil seed
Just ran through a hundred G's
Just on gambling and weed, goddamn
Nah ain't no layin' up, ain't no sleep, I'm tryna eat
If she don't understand me I don't need her

[Verse 2: MobSquad Nard]
Show your right
I ain't even hit these bitches, I'm Dolemite
Show  the night
Hit twenty-sevens, that's if you rollin' right
Bro these niggas hate on my soul, they know I'm the prototype
Come from copyin', snatching clothes, livin' the coldest sight
I don't live the gopher life, go for what you know for life
Five and now I run it, made my favorite point that four for life
I throw up my four for life, Free Tre, they got lil bro for life
Four to a Benz, I copped that sight and got my soldier right
Too fake in the trenches, I'm pointing, I'm on the road tonight
Two plays on the bench with my forty, pull up on brodie tight
Stuffed the stash with hair-triggers, no clippers, get you more than right
Boy this life will have niggas jealous you thought was more than tight
I just pray at night my lil nigga stay in his daughter's life
Smile when my son talking dreams 'cause he know it's more to life
In my house I'm the coach and the quarterback
Wrapped the thirty last week, I'm in the made tryna shake forty bag

[Chorus: Starlito]
I got a family to feed
Wanna plant me a lil seed
Just ran through a hundred G's
Just on gambling and weed, goddamn
Ain't no layin' up, ain't no sleep, I'm tryna eat
If she don't understand me I don't need her
I got a family to feed
Wanna plant me a lil seed
Just ran through a hundred G's
Just on gambling and weed, goddamn
Ain't no layin' up, ain't no sleep, I'm tryna eat
If she don't understand me I don't need her

[Verse 3: Starlito]
Yeah I beat the odds and you could say I'm getting even (Lito)
She sign for the spot, I run my bands up then I'm leaving (gone)
Say I broke her heart and that she really thought that we was friends
Told her that I loved her but that was only for the weekend
Every text and picture out my phone gon' get deleted
I'm an only child, I'm prone to get so lonely for no reason
These hoes know I don't need 'em
Lost my homie, I'm still grieving
Cuz was known for pistol squeezing
Gon' be gone for sixty seasons
'bout to print these pictures briefly
Send literature for reading
Got no kids but every December I still turn to Christopher Kringle 'til they free him
I don't do this shit for me, I disagree
Bitch I, bitch I got a plug and every nigga with me eatin'
I still ain't sleepin'

[Chorus: Starlito]
I got a family to feed
Wanna plant me a lil seed
Just ran through a hundred G's
Just on gambling and weed, goddamn
Ain't no layin' up, ain't no sleep, I'm tryna eat
If she don't understand me I don't need her

[Outro: Starlito]
I got a family to feed
Wanna plant me a lil seed
Just ran through a hundred G's
Just on gambling and weed, damn
