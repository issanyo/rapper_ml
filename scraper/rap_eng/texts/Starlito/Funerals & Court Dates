[Hook: Lito and Robin Raynell]
Beefing over Nothing
Our goals is clothes to get hoes
Lo and behold another soul in her stomach
Unprepared though we know it's coming young and scared
It's more to life than guns dope and money

{Verse 1: Lito}
Her eyes watering he Just sold an onion
Right off Rick church
Pull up to Prince's chicken its closed it's Monday
He said pull up anyway his phone was jumping
Life changed over eleven hundred
He was only making 170 off it


[Hook: Robin Raynell]
Always said it never mattered to me
Rather have you Here than in the streets
Promise if you come back every time you leave every time you leave



[Hook: Lito and Robin Raynell]
What you think happened next
She getting rapid text
The Baby gone look like him but momma Where daddy at
Hard to find words to say
I just can't explain



[Hook: Lito]
You out Here beefing over Nothing
Our goals is clothes to get hoes
Lo and behold another soul in her stomach
Unprepared but we know it's coming young and scared
It's more to life we Just don't know about Nothing


[Verse 2: Lito]
Daddy was in a coma I'm stoned Fuck it
I guess the apple Right beside the tree I think somebody lied to me
Yea a survivor of this bullshit rivalry
All I got is my pride n hate and a rider in the driver seat
Ain't no bright side ain't no Right time
Fuck sun down let's do it Right now
And as crazy as it might sound
I ain't Just rapping
Man this shit really happened
Ain't gotta write it down
Bestfriend in a nightgown
Hospital visits I'm tripping it got me biting down
Every night flight I'm living like I'm Just dying now
My voice for reason Just quiet down


[Bridge : Lito]
What you think happened next
Ain't no more rapper checks
I'm out Here on my own
Fuck it that's that on that




[Hook: Lito]
You out Here beefing over Nothing
Our goals is clothes to get hoes
Lo and behold another soul in her stomach
Unprepared but we know it's coming young and scared
It's more to life we Just don't know about Nothing


[Verse 3: Lito]
He be getting money that's a whole other subject
Shot a Nigga shit up cause he told on his cousin
Felt the Nigga snitching didn't deserve to breathe
But I gotta price on his head too that's word on the street
It's gone be first degree murder the verdict gone read
Just like obituaries another Nigga buried
Bunch of pictures on tees another kid that won't meet
His Dad who got his cousin on phone
That had a play for a zone
He figured what could go wrong
He riding strapped all alone
Facing a blunt of that strong
He called and told him come on
He made a left at that light Right off Dickerson Road
And like a thief in the night
A car drove out the carwash
And tried to flip his shit over
The moral of the story
Is when it's over it's over
I prefer not to say that I told ya
But it's all I know bruh
Where I grew up alot of Niggas didn't get to grow up
Get killed for the fingers that you throw up
Nigga shoot you bout a bitch but let you owe em
My cup runneth over
I'm still hollering pour up
Shawty Just waiting on her baby daddy to show up



[Outro: Starlito]
Hey son if you hearing this it means I ain't make it
Loved your mama to death and drove you grandmother crazy
Take Nothing for granted I was greedy and lazy
And used the bullshit excuse of I'm feeding my baby
You shouldn't have to reason with me not seeing ya face
Couldn't even embrace ya shouldn't have to replace me
