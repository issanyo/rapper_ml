[Verse 1: Don Trip]
We exchange numbers, then we go on dates
Then we fall hard, maybe it's fate
Maybe it's too soon or maybe too late
We grow together, then we grow astray
Then we separate and mask our feelings
We try to move on but who are we kidding?
I mean who are we fooling, who we tryna convince?
What don't come out in the wash, it's gon' come out in the rinse
Now we all drenched, when it rains it pours
We take fewer trips but you trippin' more
They say more money, more problems
Guess we were happier poor
I toss a coin in the well and wish that this was before
But ain't no going back

[Interlude: Starlito]
Nah, ain't no going back
Anything's better than this
Thought we established that
Every horror story never end
Anything's better than goin' back, ahh

[Chorus: Robin Raynelle & Starlito]
I hate you so much, 'cause I love you to death
From the bottom of my heart until I take my last breath
What did I do to make you so cold
You're not the man I used to know
You would never tell me lies
He could look me in my eyes
You called me just to tell me good night
Now all you want to say is goodbye
No going back (no going back)
Ain't no going back, anything's better than goin' back
Anything, anything, anything
(there ain't no going back)
No going back (ain't no going back)
Anything, anything, anything

[Verse 2: Starlito]
No I won't complain, I guess it's growing pains
Only sleep on airplanes and dream about owning things
Baby I want to change but then my phone will ring
Here we go again, you know the game
I'm just a player and I won't retire
Kobe Bryant, Nolan Ryan
Paper over pussy, P.O.P., hold it down
I won't know how to trust 'til someone show me how
You said I didn't start caring 'til you wasn't around
How that sound, I guess I got my feelings out the lost and found
It's what I'm on, I guess you off it now
We went from layin' up, hanging out
To hanging up, walking out
Waking up and calling just to face it, we can't talk it out

[Chorus: Robin Raynelle & Starlito]
No going back (ain't going back, ain't no goin' back)
Anything, anything, anything (anything's better than goin' back 'cause it's difficult to start out but it's better than goin' backwards)
No going back (no going back)
Anything, anything, anything
Anything
Anything's better than that
Anything's better than going backwards
Anything
Ain't no going back
