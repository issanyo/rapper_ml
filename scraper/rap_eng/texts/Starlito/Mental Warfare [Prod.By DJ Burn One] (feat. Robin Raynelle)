I spent all my time (Trying not to lose control)

All my time

I lost my mind (Trying not to lose my soul)

Trying not to lose my soul, my soul

When you alone the world seem so big, I feel like I'm by myself

Cause I never hear from nobody, until they need my help

I got 8 bills to pay today, and 2 more due on the 12th

Half of 'em ain't even mine, hell I probably just smoke what's left

I tell you what I ain't gon' do, feel sorry for myself

I'mma do it 'til they say I did it to death, fall off, nah dog kidding yourself

I'm at a crossroads where my choices determine my fortune

It's either do business with vultures or unemployment

Went to the doctor for one appointment, she said I was crazy

Well not really, depressed and prescribed all types of medication

I read the side effects, decided I wouldn't ever take 'em

How ironic I wasn't ever patient just overly dedicated

Can't please everyone, can't balance everything right now I don't even wanna try

Swear a nigga so mufuckin' tired that I might not sleep when I die

Riding 'round with this heat on my side

Since I was younger I had beef and all my pride

Cause these niggas think I'mma let it slide

My homies probably think I won't ride

I just think that I think too much

On top of that I still drink and get high

So fuck it, it's an eye for an eye, now the blind lead the blind

Now you losing control, losing yo soul, losing time

Got off your grind, you lost yo mind, I spent all of mine trying not to
