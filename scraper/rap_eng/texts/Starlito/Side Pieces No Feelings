Trakksounds
Uhh huh uhh huh
No feelings
No feelings
[Chorus-Starlito]
We each other side pieces, we know our roles and play it well
(play it well) Sometimes we role play as well (as well)
She know the rules, its never tell
She know the rules

[Verse 1-Starlito]
No feelings, unless we touchin and feelin
She getting in touch when she with it, able and ready ill kill it
Lay on the bed, like lets get
She only got 30 minutes
Gotta hurry and finish, I got, I got
Nah we don't waste time, I'm on the way
She on my facetime  (facetime)
(Where ya close at) and I hate lyin
Its so good I wanna make her mine (make her mine)
You fuckin up

[Verse 2-Starlito]
No feelings, unless we touchin and feelin
Yeah all that rough shit she with it, and I don't look at her different
I could be addictive, I'm hoopin, I'm trippin
Thinking about doing again, why I'm already in it after a brief intermission
I think I need intervention, I know it lust but I love it
We got no need for commitment

[Chorus-Starlito]
We each other side pieces, we know our roles and play it well
(play it well) Sometimes we role play as well (as well)
She know the rules, its never tell
She know the rules
