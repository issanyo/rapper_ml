And I can't sleep...

Early morning, business calling, waiting on the sun to rise
Swervin only, little lonely, Carter told her, "Come outside."
Text her back, too old to try to sound polite
It read, "Please bring me a cup of ice. I promise I'ma fuck you right."

Got god swab plus some Jolly Rancher, sour syrup, baby food jars, and baby bottles for example. Stupid perks

Up all night like Gilbert Godfrey
On that loud, call it Gilbert Godfrey
Strapped like Gilbert Arenas, pill poppin, hibachi
Zani’s till I don’t feel the molly
Pandora on Phil Collins
Ten years in bitch I'm still ballin
Chill dog, just trying to get a ticket like they left my name at will call
And I can't sleep so I count it with the people I can count on
The air in the ear I was awake all night getting my countin on
It's gonna be like this from now on

No, I can't sleep til they stop sleeping on me...

Look, I've been beefin homie
Riding around with that heater on me
Ready to give it to erry-one  of these niggas
Even if they don't want it
Chiefing that diesel
Bumpin Beanie Siegel The Reason thinking bout how we used to serve morning to evening only
I went straight from the jects to a check
Lost plenty of homies, but not respect
Success bittersweet like a text from your ex, hah
Let's pour out a little lean for all the young kings that never seen they princesses turn into queens

Just like we dream
No I can't sleep but I still have a dream
Hit one like this
I wasn't eating so I had to skeem
Never been on the front of one of those magazines
I was on front line more than one time
Unloading those magazines
Yeah, pumpin all that gasoline when my younger bro had to stash the green
Got turned out by the cash I seen
I procrastinated now I have to make it
I'm fascinated by faster ring
Chasing paper sleep deprivation
Yo bitch dog I'm laughin at this nigga who just jacked with some beans

Life ain't no fairytale, I just know this shit is real but, scarytale. You know, I just don't want to lie to them. Do anything but sleep or tell
