Nortripyline

Man I mean this from the bottom of my heart, just quit callin my phone
Stupid bitch, the world small but my headache is enormous, leave me alone! Ahh
[Verse 1]
Put my phone in air plane mode, before my head explode
Wanna write a song but I'm ready to go
Seem like my money jump outta my pocket as soon as I make it, niggahs are bitches ion know who's the fakest!
Greed and jealousy, tools of hatred, they won't allow us to make shit, we choose to take it
Poppin pills till it feels as if you was in the matrix, she on them drugs too and y'all ain't using the latex
Her momma ex boyfriend he used to rape chicks
Her an her little sister but they wouldn't say shit
Momma wouldn't believe her till this day
It's something that won't allow her to look in her face
Which brings her to you, yeah you at a loss too
So y'all confinding, who else you gonna talk to
Thought you had a friend, homie lover and end
She went drugging on to a niggah who's thugging
She really just want attention
She never knew nothing other but destruction
And yo dependency for love, look what it does
Have you chasing a whore, but in yo dreams she's an house wife
Love is the worst drug they got out right now
I can't finish my head hurtin. My head hurtin, my... Head... Hurtin.shhhhh

[Verse 2]

Lil mama you wrong, look how you bringing your daughters up
It ain't her fault if moneys what she calls love
And she out her running wild, to be caught up Pregnant by a wanna be baller
With some felonies that caught up to him
3 strikes no pop flies hes outta here
For a lotta years, another fatherless daughter here
With a mother fuckin, Money lovin
For a mother part time whore slash full time cluber, that had a good guy
Once but he never wore a rubber, cheated on her with a thug
That's an whole another
Now the baby got aids from her grand momma ex
And so does the good guy, make love fuck sex
Gone
My head hurtin x6
