[Chorus]
No need for bringing up my past, but you don't even know the half
Nah you don't even know the half, hard times don't last
I was down to my last then, stayed down 'til I cashed in
Just like I imagined when I was riding around in that Magnum
A lot of pounds out the vacuum, and we got it now, that ain't past tense
Looking like I got a sack in, everybody acting like we back friends, I'm just laughing
Spent five and I stashed ten off the backend
Got a tan mind and a black Benz with that FN

[Verse 1]
I don't know what they want from me
I just went and got my own money
Niggas acting like I owe 'em something
Same time need a loan from me
I was trapped out with my phone jumping
And I cashed out, told them don't front me
I was searching for an early exit
Tryna back out 'cause I know they coming
I was sipping on that syrup heavy
Popping thirties, yeah, really road running
I done damn near got murdered
Had me with a thirty round clip in both guns
Nigga say they want smoke
Tell you no joke, man that shit ain't no fun
I done really went broke from it
And I lost touch, made me go numb
Ran it up once I sobered up
In four months counted four hundred
Getting so much, got more coming
Got to focus, know they counting on me
Either that or they counting me out, or both of 'em
Pay my lawyer with the show money
Bought a Rollie off the dope money

[Chorus]
No need for bringing up my past, but you don't even know the half
Nah you don't even know the half, hard times don't last
I was down to my last then, stayed down 'til I cashed in
Just like I imagined when I was riding around in that Magnum
A lot of pounds out the vacuum, and we got it now, that ain't past tense
Looking like I got a sack in, everybody acting like we back friends, I'm just laughing
Spent five and I stashed ten off the backend
Got a tan mind and a black Benz with that FN

[Verse 2]
I'm as private as I ever been
Cause you might turn state's evidence
I'm just tryna make the president
Even though I hate the president
I don't want to be compared to them
Don't care who you think I ain't better then
If I lose 'cause I let you win
So we can triple up when we bet again
I be telling all my young niggas
Get it while you're hot, hope it never end
Fuck the bitch then I kicked her out
Said I'm not trying to let the devil in
Had to log off my Instagram
Damn near fell in love with a set of twins
I was fucked up, then I met a plug
Got my credit up, that's irrelevant
Why the fuck you watching my pockets
All in my business, ho you meddling
Most not know I'm too intelligent
I ain't fucking with you like I'm celibate, no I'm abstinent
Ran up this cash 'cause I'm passionate
Been that nigga, better ask them niggas
I wear the gun like it's fashion
Ain't tryna pass 'em, better outlast them

[Chorus]
No need for bringing up my past, but you don't even know the half
Nah you don't even know the half, hard times don't last
I was down to my last then, stayed down 'til I cashed in
Just like I imagined when I was riding around in that Magnum
A lot of pounds out the vacuum, and we got it now, that ain't past tense
Looking like I got a sack in, everybody acting like we back friends, I'm just laughing
Spent five and I stashed ten off the backend
Got a tan mind and a black Benz with that FN
