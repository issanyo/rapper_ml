Let me tell y'all about this chick I liked
In a lot of different ways, we are just alike
Took the same trip, two different flights
Stayed in the same room, two different nights
Patron shots without ice, or straight vodka, no ice
I mean, I see straight through her, and she's not my type
Nymphomaniac just like me
But I think she treats every dude just like me
Yeah, I can't trust her, never did
And if I can't trust, then I shouldn't lust for her
Ask me to buy her something, I feel like a customer
Me being a hustler, I just couldn't fuck with her
Plus, I'm beefing and she playing me to close
I ain't thinking about my safety conversating with them hoes
I tried to show patience, play it how it go
But it bothered me so bad, I had to say I gotta go
We relapsed trying to recapture what we had
And we failed, but only she has to be sad
You can't keep it real, I know it now
You ain't have to say that you would hold me down, naw
