Feat. Don Trip

(Verse)
I need a calculator and a tape measure
To count it up, my paper long
Shoot your a** with this 22
And you won't die untill you make it home
I don't give a fuck if they don't like me
That's my favorite song
We beefin', just know my money right
I prefer filet mignon
See me in a rental car, probably riding filthy
Strapped like somebody wanna kill me
Somebody gotta feel me
A lot of my partners pro'ly plotting
Prolly done shot somebody then forgot about it
I'm out here grinding, can't lie about it
Ps of that master cush, let's just say
I'm bout it bout it
Chilling with my bougie bitch all she eat is calamari
Man if looks could kill
Go check her closet, shorty caught a body
Broke nig' with the small product
Shooting like a bottle rocket
East side, I gotta shout it
Parachuting, sky diving
Parasailing, rock climbing
Bungee jumping off the highest mountain
That's fly s***, my kind of s***
I might ask your lady is she can drive a stick
I'm stunting hard, I buy the mall
Take her wid me, I won't buy her s***

(Pre-Hook)
If you don't owe a n**** s***, then this yo' song
If you are, you ain't playn wid it, you know you are
You might feel like me and say f*** 'em
And then move on
What eva the case, I ain't tryna kid you, just say the line

(Hook x2)
Shut up, b****, I'm grindin'
Shut up, b****, I'm grindin'
Looking for me, lets talk money
That's the only way you will find me

(Verse)
In case you needed a reminder
We on that grind cuz
Wouldn't be surprised if my shoes was scuffed
Looka how I climbed up
Working out like the fitness club
Moving pounds without signing up
Went and put cameras every where
Nigga got tired of fucking the blinds up
Watching the money is where you can find us
Your baby momma justify slut
The only way she having my kid
Is she don't swallow for nine months
I finally mae my mind good
Ain't tryna end up in no line, no
Been major since I was a minor
Earn money more than vagina
I'm tryna tell ya I'm scared to talk on my segment
A hundid pounds of that grade A
My momma ain't raising no failure
I finally got my bells up
F*** it, why am I using a scale
Straps, I neva get held up
They won't find your a** 'til they smell you
Two pumps like an inhaler
Two months ago I took it ill, brother
I'm just now bouncing up from it
Tryna dribble up these lil' rap money
You n****s ready for gas money
Still cashing checks from cash money
Grind like I'm down to my last honey
Ride 'til I die like a crash dummie
When I'm out, make aturn, yo, I'm riding around
Got my mind on the thousand right now, b****
When I'm out in the town, ain't no putting me down
Cause them niners are part of my outfit
Shoe with the signers I cunt with
Few hundid bands on my house, b****
I'm going in like I'm grounded
And my yungins fly, I say round trip

(Pre-Hook)
If you don't owe a n**** s***, then this yo' song
If you are, you ain't playn wid it, you know you are
You might feel like me and say f*** 'em
And then move on
What eva the case, I ain't tryna kid you, just say the line

(Hook x2)
Shut up, b****, I'm grindin'
Shut up, b****, I'm grindin'
Looking for me, lets talk money
That's the only way you will find me
