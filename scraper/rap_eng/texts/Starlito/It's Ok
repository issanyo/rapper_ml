[Chorus]
Is it the way you call my name
That keeps me running right back to you
Or maybe just your ways are so unpredictable
I never know what you’re going through
Baby it’s ok baby it’s ok baby it’s ok baby it’s ok

[Verse 1]
We break up to make up then break up again
I wake up without you one day feel like ten
My angel she pray for me daily for safety while I get it in
I’m out here all by my lonely
She know I hate making new friends
N*gga’s be fake they pretend smiling
Really be snakes in the end I’m grinding
Yeah I play for the win
Can’t lie my patience getting thin
Thankful my paper getting thicker
Can’t go nowhere without taking some pictures
Can go nowhere without taking my pistol
Maybe I’m crazy
Play me too close and maybe suspicious

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It’s easy for you to say
I’m leaving you can stay
Even try moving away
Ended up thinking of you today
And the games two can play
I kind of blame you in a way
Ravishing Rick Rude awakening,  wake up might go hit game two in the A
Call it plan B like I want to see you looking for rules to break
Give her the D call it confession call me confused and crazy maybe
I’m on a losing streak
Losing sleep losing weight
2 liters doing two in a day
Overdoing the drank like it soothes the pain
(baby it’s ok)
So and so say my music changed
Black sheep don't grin no need to explain
Even though I can’t take it with me
I be needing that dough
Like I’m making biscuits
She keeps saying that it’s all gravy
Baby it’s okay [x3]
