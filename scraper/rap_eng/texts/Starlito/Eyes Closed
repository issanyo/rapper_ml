[Verse 1-Starlito]
Woahhh Grind hard
The harder I grind the more they hate. They hate but I'm gettin this money

Okay I pour a dose or two, sippin on a four-by-four. (By four)
Blowin dough though but I'm still awake like I'm on no doughs. High on the sky but my eye's low
Yeah I know,(I know)  they underground, I get around. (riding around)
Rest in peace uncle Chad
Rest in peace uncle Pac, (Yeah) still feel that your murder was tragic
I'm the nephew you never had
I'm you with a syrup habit. (syrup habit)
Still remember where I was ninety-six when I heard what happened. (when I heard what happened)
My first cousin Karmin born the same night
Recurring patterns of thought return when ya name get brought up and love em just like your music forever
Every since you, who would'a knew you'd influence my future endeavors
Take them hoes to the telly, they get looser than ever
I'm sippin juice, totin metal
Might get to shoot one whenever

[Chorus-Starlito]
All these pussy niggas taking shots. Must be shootin with they eyes closed. (shooting with they eyes closed)
I'ma be thuggin til my eyes closed. (Ive been thuggin til my eyes closed nigga)
I'ma be smoking till my eyes closed, sippin til my eyes closed
And I swear all the niggas see is gwap
In this even with my eyes closed, even with my eyes closed. (eyes closed)
I count that money with my eyes closed. (Eyes closed)
Smokin til my eyes closed
Sippin til my eyes closed (Eyes closed)

[Verse 2- Starlito]
I closed my eyes, tried to pray. Good Lord I'm so high today. (Try)
Wait, what I'm trying to say, (Shh) as far as I got
Probably a little tired but I'm wide awake
If in nice by the way. Run up by me by mistake, won't let hatred decide my fate. (No)
Thankful, I'm grateful, I pray for family and love and better judgement and patience but understand I'm a thug. (i'm a thug)
Slow my plan up, I had gambling, should have ran this shit up. Riding around Atlanta in a Phantom with a fem and two cups. Wait, close my eyes I'm daydreaming
I stay scheming, I work early mornings and late evenings
Buy the whole pint for the eight even. (eight)
Bought a quarter pound for the eighty. (winning)
I'm Adolf for no reason
I'ma sixteen just to triple that then I'm laid up at the four seasons
Use to serve the J's I say I'm leaving just to get J's out both seasons. (Thuggin)
Although I'm almost incoherent, the drink and the drugs so cohesive
My flow complete, I'm just passing game. (ohh)
Did you catch that? You should coach receivers
Get half a bar, just hope that you know that we know that you're broke and we don't believe you

[Chorus-Starlito]
All these pussy niggas taking shots. Must be shootin with they eyes closed. (shooting with they eyes closed)
I'ma be thuggin til my eyes closed. (Ive been thuggin til my eyes closed nigga)
I'ma be smoking till my eyes closed, sippin til my eyes closed
And I swear all the niggas see is gwap
In this even with my eyes closed, even with my eyes closed. (eyes closed)
I count that money with my eyes closed. (Eyes closed)
Smokin til my eyes closed
Sippin til my eyes closed (Eyes closed)
