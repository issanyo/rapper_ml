[Verse 1]
I hate that feeling I be feeling when we fight
Two wrongs can’t get it right, mix the anger with the spite
Just like what’s in my sprite, I’m chemically imbalanced
Irrational when challenged, no manager but I manage
Sometimes I want to vanish, my mind disadvantaged
She crying but I don’t feel sorry, you signed up for this, I’m saying
It’s pain all in my cup, no this is not no liquid courage
I just damn near shot a nigga, I just wanna sip my syrup
You can’t see the signs, I don’t want to be disturbed
Two hundred pounds of mid and I don’t want to see no birds
What the fuck you mean? Fuck what you done heard
All of my phones on silent, used to make 5 every chirp
Twelve five for a sleeve, twenty five for the shirt
They be lying bout the work, half these niggas jerks
I been through the worst, I take my strap with me to church
Feel played, Imma take some’, that’s my reimbursement
Still my plays caught, they get taxed with getting worse
Rap niggas like these Instagram bitches, that’s not me in person
Worth something, still I’ll murk something
I been working on something, don’t worry, it’s coming
Black Sheep Don’t Grin

[Verse 2]
You won’t know how I feel less I tell you
I feel like taking a nigga track and going in
I feel like taking a nigga sack and blowing ten, AGAIN
I feel like karma done caught up with me and lapped me
I feel like Boosie before he got locked up, I’m still happy
Trigger happy, with three shows
Back to back to back like Phil Jackson
A Young Thug, feel like Fabo, I’m still snapping
[?] some nigga are [pill packers?]
They just rapping, I’m reenacting
Just ask 'em, it really happened
Two hundred something skittles in a Mentos box
Hit me up Red Dot with that extendo Glock
Hickory Hollow Mall soon as they open, 'bout ten o’clock
I miss my niggas, free the guys, I think about them a lot
Lito
Free my niggas
