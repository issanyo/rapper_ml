[Verse 1:]
The money just makes you worse
Just not everyday feels like the first
My family dependent on me
I guess this is a gift and a curse
Yea i try my best not to go berserk
Became a monster oh no I'm not talking
About Uncle Fester or Lurch or Cousin It
I provide for over a dozen kids
It's a wonder I ain't cut my wrist
I walk this road I'm all on my own
But I keep stepping in piles of shit
What ever don't kills me
Does nothing but makes me pissed
My back against the walls but I still got my fist
I signed my name before I know the risk
All that's on my mind is getting us rich and
Moving us all out of this bitch
I mean this hole I got my eyes on the goal
Guess I'm the number one like Rose
I go in as hard as I can now I pray I just come out whole
I scar my body never make it touch my soul
Never let they see me mope and if I ever decide to give up
Well hell is definitely froze
I look at my babies and tell them
That we’ll make it no matter the pain
And I'm ready to take it I'm ready for war
Like the united nation just stay out of my way
Good luck good bye and good day & Godspeed

[Chorus:]
Before I ever bow down
Before I ever tap out
I would turn my head up to the sky
And I'll tell heaven I'm on my way (way way way)
I'll tell heaven I'm on my way (way way way)
I said Before I ever bow down
Before I ever tap out
I would turn my head up to the sky
And I'll tell heaven I'm on my way (way way way)
I'll tell heaven I'm on my way (way way way)

[Verse 2:]
Let us pray dear lord let them never ever hesitate
With my paper because that day they might look the devil in the face
FN on my waist featherweight heavier weaponry where i stay
But before I ever bow down stand a
Better chance catching a case
And I never say I'm a celebrity cause I never be celebrating
They only checking for me because I got a check
But I rarely ever be saving I
Promise I'm a comma fucker upper
Yeah but I promise sometimes it feels like I hustle for others
Stronger from the days I struggled
Pushing all this weight no muscle
I swear I'm so impatient no I don't be waiting on nothing
Still calling my play no huddle
Went through a band like Stanford loosing
Guess I'm the one like Cam Newton
Cause I'm always coming out of pockets
See I been getting paid since college
Dropped out, got it, poppin'
Homie say his student loans about 80 G’s
Worst part about it the job he got
Is not related to the degree
I’m just telling my dreams, I'm just grinding
I’m still trying to make it out the streets
World so cold so I stayed with the heat
Like D. Wade since 3

[Chorus:]
Before I ever bow down
Before I ever tap out
I would turn my head up to the sky
And I'll tell heaven I'm on my way (way way way)
I'll tell heaven I'm on my way (way way way)
I said Before I ever bow down
Before I ever tap out
I would turn my head up to the sky
And I'll tell heaven I'm on my way (way way way)
I'll tell heaven I'm on my way (way way way)
