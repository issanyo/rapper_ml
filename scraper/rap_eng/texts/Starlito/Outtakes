Did we just become best friends?
YUP
Do you wanna go do karate in the garage?
YUP

[Starlito]
Bitch I got a plug, I lucked up
He got the cheapest ticket
Loudest reefer in the city
And I keep it with me Solo
Don’t give a fuck
I got that heater with me
A-a-a-and I'm on it
So that means she can get it
And though my blunt is
I'm far beyond lit
Let's just be honest
I'm a Lebron bitch, king
You on that nonsense
And if that shit read
Starlito don’t rip
That’s a typo here goes Don Trip

[Don Trip]
Mr. Don Trip
East side gun smith
Pockets both clumpy
Drums hold hundreds
Yeah I got it covered get more pussy than a convent
And ye ain't getting none unless she drunk shit
Yeah yo money funny but I got no time for nonsense
I got good humorous, wrist colder than a drumstick
I'm just tryna eat and fast money sound scrumptious
Bitch I got more bills than the library of congress
Still in the trap with a couple bowls of mean green
And I don’t wanna talk or testify, though I've seen things
All about my cake like Ho-Ho’s and Ring Dings
Don Trip and Starlito, we can be the dream team, really

[Don Trip]
Pistol dirty, leave the scene clean
Lito smoking on some shit I swear look like a string bean
I still make the money fast gotta count it slow
Now bitch I'm goin' in like I found a hole, there we go

[Starlito]
They put me in the mix, I'm up with hope and down with dope
Mc with a Hammer spike my Fanta quarter pound to blow
Now im thrown
Paranoid to blow up can't trust shit
This gun dirty and ain't got no safety, can't touch this
Either speakers or a shotty, I keep something in the trunk
And my shooters also snorters, you know pumps and a bump
Hammer time
Turn this mother out understand me?
I do what I want to do say what I wanna say, yeah Adam’s Family
Trip, that’s my family
Step brother, actually
Gotta pray just to make it through the day and I got that strap with me
In the event of confrontation it speaks on behalf of me
And shes not a good listener so she say blast me or I have to leave
Gone

[Don Trip]
Nice assist, I got the shot when you pass it back to me
Ridin' with a dirty strap, a couple stacks and a sack of weed
Lay yo bitch down, drippin' wet like she at the beach
But you just yo baby back, Applebees, actually
Try me if you want to become an amputee
I got AK, SK, HK, PK, even .223
My heart pump blood at 2 degrees
I'm cold as ice, no jewelry
And bitch I been through hell so all this heat is nothing new to me
Truthfully

[Starlito]
We go hard
There ain't much more to explain nigga
Glad yall came
Though it was over?
Well it ain't, nigga!

[Don Trip]
Ok, I admit life's a bitch
But I can't quit her
Bitch I ball like Star but I can't dribble
Yeah you rap niggas jokin but I ain't tickled
I'm countin money right now so I can't giggle
Slang everything but Advil
Baby I'm so deep in that water
You think I had gills
Lil pretty bitch look bad in a glass heels
She suck a hundred dicks and blame it on that half a pill

[Starlito]
Bring the yoppers where yo momma and yo dad live
It’ll be much louder than a Waka Flaka ad-lib
Should never gave her that half a pill
Now I can't get her ass to chill
She intrigued about the shit I rap about and how I do that for real
It went like this I had a deal
Didn’t work, I had to deal
For cash money ironic but the chronic in a vacuum seal
I go hard in the paint like dry bristles
And before I buy some pussy I problaby buy a pistol
And before I die I'm looking into buying Krystal
Sell squares all night what's on my menu
Greens, yams, rolls
Uh-uh no soul food
Said I go ham and hard as a motherfucker
Before those dudes

[Don Trip]
Fuck y'all picking at me for
Gotta be more than the reefer
I pay my nigga to sneak up
Crawl down and delete ya
You rap nigga got ya feet up
Old ass nigga can't keep up
Yeah yall got your dough but to me and my folk yall look like pizza
I'm ballin bitch and im G’d up
Same price for my features
But all these eggs I got for sale turn any day into easter
Pound bag like tree shrubs
Open you just see buds
I know I'm offensive
But I don’t give any fuck

[Starlito]
And I don’t think anyone
Really wants to see us
I'm in the cut rollin up, I'm on my Wiz Khalifa
Let him tell it, I don’t need blunts
Oh well more for me cuz
If trip Dale, then you can call me Brennan and find me in the trees bruh
What happened with all these reruns
Ask Shirly, she'd agree
I mean so the only person see it is me
I gotta nigga with an attitude, Eazy-E
Kick a bitch out like beat it be
Or pam know you like damn
That was Kanye's line
Well, really it was Wayne's line
This ain't the time, but
I go ham
Damn that was my song, could have sworn I put it out a year or so ago, but, maybe im wrong
Few radio spins, I was doin my thang
Did the remix with Gucci Mane
Matter of fact you can google it man
Just type in: LITO

[Don Trip]
Mo flo than a speedboat
Still here chasin the Cheetos
All I see is c notes
But I live by the g code
F yo name then peacoats
Red dots, and deep scopes
Bitch I'm here for war like 10 HUT, 3 4
Married to all this sweet dough
One here in the gazebo
Bring a tear on my eye and a ring to my hand
As I read my vows to my b roll
R.i.P to sweet jones
This pimp shit got me on
Take a bad bitch and feed her shrimp plates and a T-bone
My license plate read king kong
Extended magazines on
My forty Glock put a bitch nigga to sleep and tell them dream on
My neighborhood is the green zone
So come get you some green son
I would show mercy to yal rap nigga but star keep throwin more beats on

[Starlito]
Nah bro ya can't blame me
You got me back rapping so you can't leave
Might change beats but won't change teams
Grind hard, just aim squeeze
Trash bag gang same thing
I fuck yo main squeeze
Don’t tell him that he cold or it'll go to his head... brainfreeze
Let me tell you bout my ‘ponent my brother just didn’t know it
He was cryogenically frozen then I tried to steal his mojo then freeze
I was blue on Mortal Kombat, you might catch a chill on contact
You’ll see it when I breethe my finishin move will make you freeze
I ain't talkin bout me im talkin bout my heart just in case you followed all that
Evil coldhearted killer for what im bout to do to this track
Freeze, red light green light go
Told me my shit clean I know
Pipes loud as the weed I blow
Green a long way fee fi foe
Fumble through the guap but dropping dimes Is just not possible
Still hang with the robbers too, fuck a nigga paper like a prostitute
Woop a nigga ass then pop him too
Lookin at the lane while im watching the news
My young nigga say what I got to do
Drop a whole bag on a robber crew

[Don Trip]
Tell em this our block yall got to move
Its either that or we gotta shoot
Ain't a god damn thing that a cop could do
It be another half an hour before they got to you
My block much to hot to snooze
So around her heats not optional
I might cop me a block or two
Eagles hawks and cardinals
Im cold enough to get freezer burn
Send fifty stacks to my legal firm
Chillin in the trap with a bad bitch
And that bitch might need a perm
But ye ain't bout money why be concerned
I stuff my shit like a taxidermist
But yall wanna eat with me and my gang
Bring a lunchbox and back a thermos

[Starlito]
And a thermal freeze me polo to my feet
And my lil fo fo yelling squeeze me
Loco with those vocals I know theyre supposed to treat me
But all I know is Dro you’ll find waldo before you see a C

[Starlito]
We should do this again
Its been very constructive

[Don Trip]
Shout out to the Trash Bag Gang. Sittin fat’s a way of life…
Haaah
I know I prolly take shit too far (I do)
But life is too short you dont get two starts (you don't)
The game’s been the same we only get new scars
And i’m one of a kind they don’t make new parts
I’m ice cold i prolly got a blue heart
And I never leave my team like Joe Dumars
Course I keep the iron though i dont use starch
And these niggas scared of bread they don’t do carbs
I would really hate to have to cause you harm
But if life’s really a beach you gettin thrown to the sharks
I dont want the foul’s, all i wanna do is ball
As long as i start we won't lose or draw
And we can clash like a bat to a ball
No fair fights we bringing straps to the brawl
Fuck a peace treaty we attack when it’s war
Don’t you ever turn your back to a sword
I gotta problem? yeah I know
Cause I never learned how to let shit go
So we get it poppin, bitch i promise
That i’m gon make this bitch explode
Cause bitch im throwed, i said bitch im throwed
I said bitch im throwed, i said bitch im throwed
See we get it poppin, bitch i promise
That i’m gon make this bitch explode
Cause bitch i’m throwed

[Starlito]
Boomerang throwed, when i come back i’m shootin off
Smoking like a dual exhaust, hit this all you do is cough
I ain’t got nothin to prove to y'all, but most these dudes is soft
Try me i won’t say one word, but the tool'l talk
I’m throwed, make my money out on the road
And i get money out in these streets
Still got nothin for none of these hoes
Aw naw ain’t on nothin but the dro
In case you wanna know why my eyes so low
Niggas ain't straight, bitches ain't shit
In case you wanna know why I fly solo
Trash Bag Gang, nigga Grind Hard
Anything else, I don’t know
Any other questions? I just wanna rap
Just ask it to my .44
It might bark and bite soon as the hammer strike
My bitch somewhere flippin O’s, she think she Vanna White
And she blow me ‘fore i go out, candle light
Sneaky lil freaky lil bitch, I can’t stand the type
I’ll get mad at her, prolly call your girl, on a random night
Then just pull up, fuck, get on bout my business, i ain't stayin the night
Lito!

[Don Trip]
I gotta problem? yeah I know
Cause I never learned how to let shit go
So we get it poppin, bitch i promise
That i’m gon make this bitch explode
Cause bitch im throwed, i said bitch im throwed
I said bitch im throwed, i said bitch im throwed
See we get it poppin, bitch i promise
That i’m gon make this bitch explode
Cause bitch i’m throwed

[Don Trip]
Lil rap niggas say they got beef with me
They upset cause i refuse to let em eat with me
And it cost a couple thousand dollars just to speak with me
I’m wide awake but his lady wanna sleep wit me
I’ll keep ballin in this bitch long as i keep winning
At this rate i’ll hit a home run each inning
I’m all about my dollars, so you can keep your pennies
Sorry, keep your two cents, we don’t need any
After fast money and cheap women
But i’m smart, i know better than to skeet in em
Sean John denim plus I got my heat in em
You know that iron hot enough to put a crease in em
I got my suit and briefcase, bitch i mean business
And i only been to court as a defendant
Jumpin right back in the trap soon as the beat finish
And i told my plug we can meet in 3 minutes

Thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway

[Starlito]
LITO! (how you spell that?) IDGAF
Homey i dont give a fuck, and no i dont need they help (NAW!)
Big strap in my belt, big stacks guess what else (WHAT ELSE?)
Big boy, width both sides my garage and i bought that myself
My bitch got a bitch my friend so i dont really need your ho
All my homies plugged in so who cares if you… (keep it slow?)
If you was on that we would know, you could be the…
Or one of these clown ass niggas out here beefin on my hoes
Hold up, who are you again?
My gun too big to be arguin
Don’t worry bout what im charging them
My price too lovely to be bargainin
Who they supposed to say what about bout Star, come again?
Look, i’m only concerned with makin your broad come again
She give me brains anyday
She say my chain is in the way
I drop her off, she say please stay

[Don Trip]
I know why they mad at me, im too arrogant
I come from moving packages, pounds of asparagus
Your pockets is hilarious, i’m not into charity
Stay from broke niggas they be fuckin with my allergies
I know the truth hurt, now you in agony
Me i’m seeing dollar signs, crystal clear clarity
Lit like a sunday, even on saturday
And girl i beat that pussy up, no assault and battery
Yeahhh im the sheeeit, ask the janitor
Find me in the trap, nigga how you catch a animal?
East side gorilla clique, a pack of wild cannibals
Eatin emcee’s, and oyu dont stand a chance with us
And we got that work, what you think we carry hammers for?
Ready for a gunfight, who the lucky challenger?
Everyday a payday, check your calendar
Now you know you niggas not dealing with no amateur

Thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Your opinion doesnt matter over here
But thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
No your opinion never mattered over here
Thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Your opinion doesnt matter over here
But thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
