[Starlito]
I got this vision in my head
Of this new and improved me
You don't approve of it?
Then so be it
You would assume the least
Influences from the streets
I grew up amongst Gs as well as thieves
And jealousy, so inevitably, it's hella beef
Growing up almost got the best of me
I never sleep except for when I can barely breathe
From inhaling trees, that lean got discontinued
Please let me continue
Growing up, you don't know what I seen from out my window
I wanna apologize for the dog I once was
Maybe I still am
Either way, my apology is sincere
I'm wishing you was here
Or maybe I was there
Wish I had tried to care
We used to fuck, you fell in love
Then I was out of there
Charge it to my head and not my heart, shorty
I was not aware
Of how you'd make me feel in future tense
I know what Future meant when he said
He wanna show you off to the world
Just so they can get jealous
I ain't wanna lose her
Who knew I was so competitive?
Relationships are repetitive
Now I'm taking all of these sedatives
Got me looking up to the sky like
"Why you keep taking all of my relatives
And best friends?"
They tell me, "Charge it to the game"
But the ones that are still here know
It'll never be the same
Fuck some cocaine
Fuck the dope game
I got focus and my whole life changed
Workin' with what's left
I don't know what's right, mane
For a ho or for a O-Dog
You could go out like Kane
Or your co-defendant lieutenant
Giving your first and your middle name
How real is what you call "real" really?
When it all falls down, don't you all feel silly?
How real is what you call "real" really?
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
