[Starlito Speaking]
A whole lot of times, I just be up;
Middle of the night, overnight, early mornings
Just reading..

[Verse 1: Starlito]

Feel like we slaves, thugging, risking our freedom for whips and chains
Used to want fame, along the way the mission changed
Need a physician's signature and prescription to fix this pain
Just listen, this isn't in vain, I'm really just giving game
To you lame brains, stay in your lane, show some restraint
It's real out here, I'm chilling, but they still out here dealing 'caine
Niggas telling, not to mention, they'll kill you for anything
Man, racism on the regular
I'm having strange feelings I'm being traced off of my cellular
You got these fuck niggas, fake niggas, et cetera
It's getting to the point that I hate niggas, I'm tellin' ya
Hoes too, they'll side track ya, eye-catchers
Just a distraction, so I fuck them hoes and say "bye" after
Yeah, fuck them hoes, you can have that bitch in a scouts honor
Told my accountant, I'm counting on her, trying to get this account a new comma
Praying hard that these rap fans respect the real
Record deal on schedule, Grinding Hard, I never chill
They better chill and appreciate that I let 'em live
This my seventh pill, I can't let up off of these sedatives
That's a lie, I just figured you like your rappers high
Or incoherent, as drunk as I was on Trap or Die
I'm on that Grey Goose, do I know you?
Aw, you know me, and that's so cool. LITO

You ain't gotta hold my hand, just point me to the money...

Sometimes I wonder why like Jadakiss
How y'all let the fakest shit become y'all favorite
I ain't taking shots, I'm just taking sips
You don't know about them big boys taking pics, seizing homes, taking whips
This what major fascination with that paper gets
Wonder why they fabricate it, man, cause y'all fascinated with that made up shit
Latest lady, the one you know you wanna lay up with
Wonder why I just put her to sleep and stay awake and dip
I'm gone, gone, my mind elsewhere, I need some health care
Bustin' five figure checks, but still think like I'm broke
Throwed off and I know it, I like drinking my dope
Nod off, wake up, like I ain't blinking no more
Naw, I ain't blinking, I'm drinking a dark orange Mountain Dew
Trying to cash in on my passion, feel like a abacus they all counting on you
What you gon' do, if you only knew
No crutches, no kneeling, and I'm on my own two
Heart crushed, got no feelings, violence we prone to
Wonder why I been on this grind so long, man, I don't know, do you?
I don't know much of nothing, but what I won't do
That's snitch, quit or submit, you don't know what I'm going through
You don't even know it, cause you don't need to know it
She wonder why I always look so tired
These niggas sour and I wonder why I always be so quiet
