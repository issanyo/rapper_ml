Yeah i know how this movie ends, still i play
The starring role in Starlito's way

I got my feet on the ground, but my head in the clouds
And I ain't rapping, I'm just thinking out loud
Matter fact, I'm just thinking 'bout how
I'm regarded as the truth in the south with one single out
And I understand the hatred cause success breeds envy
But the way a nigga was living, I was blessed to see twenty
This the soundtrack to my life
But I promise the movie was even better, I'm the executive director
No props, no extras, the co-stars just me
I'm the best in my city, well, arguably
Just ask how insane my parties be
Or how niggas lash out and try to target me
Mad cause they want features and I'm charging a fee
Nigga, you're paying for my presence, the bars is free
I see why they say I'm a prick
But they never ever say it to my face, they just say it to the chicks
But the ladies, they love me, they say I'm the shit
I even had a couple try to pay for the dick
When you see me in the club and you in my face tryna spit
My nigga, I go to the club to get away from that shit
I don't mean no harm, I ain't no hater, but shit
I can't help nobody that I get paper out this bitch
It's loyalty records, respect it
If for nothing more than my effort, That's just me and ???
Vowing never to go separate
A combination of my advance and the street money invested
Wanna be able to retire with a nice little nest, yeah
It was just the hustling, so this was my best bet
I'ma give it all I got, never stall or stop
Business is like a game of horse, I'm calling all my shots
Bet I never get a letter, I'm so clever
Even my mama asked me how I put it together
It's like a Ouija board, my pen moves on it's own
My nickname 2-3, cause lil' dude in the zone
I never could have imagined this and who would've known
I'd be getting paid to be doing these songs, so long
Better yet, hold on, this ain't goodbye
Shit, I'm so fly they think I live in the sky

(Successful pimp juice sip)

See, I'm that same nigga said I'm on that Grey Goose
But that ain't cut the check, so now I'm drinking Absolut
And I ain't shot a video cause I'm still hustling
Even the athletes hate me, but I'm like 'fuck em'
And I'm glad them shots ain't hit me, shit
So now I'm feeling bulletproof, like 50 cent
Got a P89 Ruger that hold 32 rounds
So if I catch you in the mall, it's going down
Put a bitch nigga in a hospital gown
Cashville's prince, but I'm coming for the crown
Give it to me or I'll take it, Them same niggas that hate me
That be the same ones at the precincts giving statements
You snitches. See I record in the booth, not a wiretap
We all know that you're the police, where your sirens at
And dude not just rappin'
And I keep that 40 on me like Udonis Haslem
And though me and Lebron James are the same age
In the streets, they say that I remind 'em of Dwayne Wade
Cause I work with diesel, and I keep that heat on me
So rap niggas, do me a favor, don't speak on me
Keep that illegal D, just like a referee
So watch you're mouth or you'll get hit with a tech, Rasheed
I'm that nigga you can't afford
I mean, I'm in the streets just like them fake ass Jordans
Look at my bitch bra, I keep my work in the there
Call my dro Dennis Rodman, cause it got purple hair
In the jar, I got orange ones, like Keyshia Cole
Still got what you need if you treat your nose
Went to school with the smart kids, the streets should know
And I made decent grades cause I kept the teachers blowed
And don't call me All-Star, it's Starlito
You want me on your song, that's a quarter kilo
