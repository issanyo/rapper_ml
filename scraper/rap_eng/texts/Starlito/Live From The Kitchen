[Intro]

[Verse 1: Starlito]

Them blocks twenty five, like I went in with a pair of dices
But that jolly green midget got me very icey
One day they here,next day they indicted
Thats why I stay getting them checks on the side like a pair of nikes
I swear to god I dont wanna serve no moe
I can't say the same bout these yellow hoes nor the syrup and dro
I know chino like I wish this nigga hurr up and blow
I just wish I ain't have to make my momma worried no moe
Im gettin money so these niggas hatin
I know i'll gun a nigga down so lord keep me out that situation
I walk around like fuck you bitches pay me
And damn near tear up everytime I'm told I look just like that nigga david
Thats my daddy I dont hate him I just ain't happy
Nor satisfied with my past so I gotta make it happen
For my kids and my kids kids and they kids after that
So they dont have to trap and they won't have to rap
On fifty one percent of the whole map the world is mine nigga
Got up off my ass then I got up on my grind nigga
I'm about to re-define realer if a pussy nigga play with me i'mma kill him

[Hook: Starlito]

These niggas hoes in designer clothes
Right now I got like ten pounds right behind the stove
Live from the kitchen got bout six different kinds of dro
Line outside the door if you ain't buying some dope its time to go

[Verse 2: Starlito]

Sack in now im landscaping
Shop with me nigga first one with that check get it I ain't playing favorites
First come first serve I ain't playing soon as I weigh it pay me
Pistol in my pants I ain't playing it keep saying spray me
I ain't playing nigga die about all this pride you a bitch and I can see it in your eyes
We riders ya'll followers confused choosing sides
Me I'mma up that chopper and let that help you decide
I tried to rationalize but they keep snatching my guys so dont be suprised
If we sliding im on the passenger side got them goonies on my payroll
And they shoot for so cheap I might fuck around and make them dump on yo block
For the whole week, fa real im talking sun up sun down gun fire nigga no sleep
I buy a house on yo street my money right you dont want beef them little niggas will
Shoot a nigga mammy what a nigga dont know for a quarter block of that snow I got brick
For the blow lets go

[Hook: Starlito]

These niggas hoes in designer clothes
Right now I got like ten pounds right behind the stove
Live from the kitchen got bout six different kinds of dro
Line outside the door if you ain't buying some dope its time to go
