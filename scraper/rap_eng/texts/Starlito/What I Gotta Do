[Intro: Starlito]
I was talkin' to Bigga Rankin the other day and you know he hella animated but it came out super genuine. He like man you gotta put on 'cause this for that nigga who mama was listening to you and he ain't know who you was, way back then
I was told it's a mandatory minimum that I go as hard as I possibly can 'cause it's some that just don't know that, you know, even though I been at it for a long time it just keep getting better

[Verse 1: Starlito]
I'ma be a legend when I dip, just like Pimp
Cross my heart and I put that on this heater on my hip
Hope to die smokin' fire, in the hotel eating shrimp
With a towel under the door, and a thick red ho
That I can be myself around and give me head slow
You say that's a lot to ask for? yeah I know
I'm just living, I'm just grinding, might get inspired by my music
Not to mention Chef produced it, he got the weed and drive Uber
Gotta have a hundred hustles if you wanna run it up
Never know when you might fuck around and run into a plug
Coincidence, no such
I don't believe in luck
How can I give 'em my heart when I don't even give a fuck?

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
And I don't take my car out park until my babies buckle up
I'm never on time but I ain't never in a rush
Kalia asked me what I ate today, I told her not much
So she gave me two dollars and told me she buying me lunch
Boy you know I cried 'cause that shit touched a nigga
I remember having cold cuts for dinner
We had to homework at candlelight
The gas stove warmed us up for winter
My babies cannot relate though
These days papa bring home the pesos
I beg you please don't interfere
I'll spray your ass faster than Maco
You so worried 'bout Drake and J-Lo
I'm more worried 'bout makin' payroll
I been on mine since my son was a day old
And I'm strapped like I joined the NATO
I been all over the map
The things I seen is sometimes hellacious
But I do whatever I gotta to make sure I make it back to my babies
Godspeed

[Chorus: Starlito]
I do what I gotta do, for the profit too
Still move like they watching because I do got a lot to lose
I do what I gotta do, we done shot at you
I'm too busy watching you, that's why I don't watch the news
I do what I gotta do, for the profit too
Still move like they watching because I do got a lot to lose
I do what I gotta do, we done shot at you
I'm too busy watching you, that's why I don't watch the news

[Verse 3: Don Trip]
By any means, it's me against the world
When times tight as a clam, I'm tryna squeeze out a pearl
There's my silver lining, most my lines got tears behind 'em
I been searching for a better way
As you can guess still haven't found it
My heart heavy, that's to keep me grounded
That way I don't get too high
That way I don't move too fast
And time don't pass me by
But all my faults don't tame my pride
I can still look you in the eyes
And tell you if I can go change it all
I'd do it all for a second time, Godspeed

[Verse 4: Starlito]
Still watching you while you watching me
Got a lot to lose but I gotta eat
I ain't watch the news since they shot at me
2002 since I got some sleep
Watch who you serve, they'll plot and creep
Probably two-thirds of your top three, step brothers
When me and Trip first met
I was in a shootout 'bout a week prior
In the studio with them assault rifles
I'ma keep mine, gotta sleep by it
On the beef diet, on the east side
High speed chase like three times
I ain't think about, didn't blink or doubt it
If I get away I'ma be fine
I'ma quit today, look at me lyin'
Geeking hard with my teeth grinding
Creepin' 'round with that P-90
For Cash Money or Yo Gotti
The streets signed me
Got a bunch of P's of some good weed
For the cheap, I'm buyin' it
Never fell off and I ain't declining since I decided

[Chorus: Starlito]
I'ma do what I gotta do, for the profit too
Still move like they watching because I do got a lot to lose
I do what I gotta do, we done shot at you
I'm too busy watching you, that's why I don't watch the news
I do what I gotta do, for the profit too
Still move like they watching because I do got a lot to lose
I do what I gotta do, we done shot at you
I'm too busy watching you, that's why I don't watch the news
