[Verse 1: Starlito]
Office Craig came up hard
From the hood but in school always said he was smart
On the other hand you got officer Bart
Confederate flags all in they front yard
Graduated the academy got they own cause
To protect and serve just playing they part

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
In these means gotta stay on guard
But behind that badge where you find they heart
Officer Bart wants to be a detective
But gladly he never had to use his weapon
But sadly hes eager and way too anxious
To be like Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon
You know where every other scene is a gun fight
If you shooting and you gotta unload
One might say it's a little extreme
But to him he just playing his role

[Verse 3: Starlito]
Say it ain't so
It's an everyday conflict
Losing your sanity, saving your soul
You can say it's just the way this shit go
This crazy world on daily patrol
Craig don't wanna be like Don Cheadle in Crash
Rather be Don Cheadle in Traffic
Can't sell out to forget where you came from
If you go undercover that's an asset
Ever seen Ice T in New Jack? Ask
Just training for the day, when he can be a street king
Corrupt coppers I hate them bastards

[Verse 4: Don Trip]
Bart granddaddy a police captain
So law enforcement runs in his family
Bart gotta prove himself to his parents
Dying to shoot a nigga down in traffic
Trying not to say the N word goddamn it
It's hard tryna break a bad habit
But it's fuck the police in these innocence streets
They don't prepare you for that in the academy
When the call came through the dispatcher
2-11, 187 how tragic, how tragic
In the back of his mind automatically
He assumed that the suspect was a black kid

[Verse 5: Starlito]
Which mean any nigga fit the description
Routine stop but he tripping high off authority
Trigger finger itchy, thats how a suspect turn into a victim
The law like to talk but they don't ever listen
But this one in particular was different
Probably would have never went to prison
Fuck the system he was paying tuition or his daddy was
Had a decent job so he went and paid in cash
Had some student loans but moving on
He was driving fast cause he was late for class

[Verse 6: Don Trip]
And here come Bart with his racist ass
Ain't no way this kid's legit
Ain't no way he drives a brand new Mercedes
He gotta be flipping bricks
Meanwhile Craig responding to a call
An officer in need of assistance
Craig fucked around left his phone on silent
His son just called but he missed it
He just wanna get his shift over
And make it home to his wife and children
Its quiet out this way most nights
So tonight shouldn't be much different

[Verse 7: Starlito]
Bart got behind the Benz
Call for back up the kid's a suspect for now
Bart's fears turned to aggression now
So he stepping out with his weapon out
The driver on the phone and he send a text message out
Like Dad I think I finna get arrested now
Terrified, but the cop feel threatened somehow
There's some details guess we left them out

[Verse 8: Don Trip]
And Craig should arrive any second now
First he gotta check his son message out
He stepped out the squad car petrified
Because the suspect is someone that he recognize

[Verse 9: Starlito]
They both scared of each other
Now thats saying something
Thought the phone in his hand was a handgun
College student shot dead in the head once
When it was said and done that was Craig's son
Damn
