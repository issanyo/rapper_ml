[Intro]
Spiffy hit me up like
What’s cool big bro
Got something for you
So you know what Imma do to it
I said he ain’t even got to send me that
You know I’m going off
Trouble Trouble

[Hook: Trouble]
You deserve better and you know it, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
Should be staying down instead of clubbing fool, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
The tour would be over and you got work tired, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
If you got it go pay your fucking bond, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that

[Verse 1: Trouble]
If you’s the reason someone went to prison you’s a fucking rat
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
How you fucked up when [?] trap, you should go and cap
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
She be dancing just to pay her bills, ain’t nothing wrong with that
I told her ain’t nothing wrong with that
Been in the game, I swear it’s fake as fuck, like watching thunder cat
Man I just took them from the back
I love my young niggas like they my sons, I always tell them that
Shit, and I ain’t even got one yet
Auntie Meila held me down on the run, I always got your back
Shit I ain’t even got to tell her that

[Hook: Trouble]
You deserve better and you know it, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
Should be staying down instead of clubbing fool, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
The tour would be over and you got work tired, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
If you got it go pay your fucking bond, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I just mixed the medium with the kush
Packed em, make some extra racks
I shouldn’t have to sell you that
I say shout out to my people, they ain’t have to mail me that
Used to borrow my boo’s car, I caught every sale out there, thank you
She know she deserve better and I know it too
Police pull me over with a pack, Imma flow it Imma throw it too
I been told some see me as a poet cause they know it’s true
Last nigga told me someone was telling, shit he told him too
He going through it, I know it fool
This real shit long overdue
Take a nigga bitch and tell her I can see the ho in you
I shouldn’t have to tell you that, you should never rat
Quit listening to this bullshit fake rap

[Hook: Trouble]
You deserve better and you know it, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
Should be staying down instead of clubbing fool, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
The tour would be over and you got work tired, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
If you got it go pay your fucking bond, I shouldn’t tell you that
I shouldn’t have to tell you that
