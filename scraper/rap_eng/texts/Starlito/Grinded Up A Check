[Verse 1]
I get straight to the point, I just want some cash
Got too many habits, I spend it fast
Sipping that shit and we smoking bad
Girl I’m like always down to my last
Keep it 1000 with all my people
Call me, I got it, that’s if you need it
Yeah she look decent but she deceiving
Figured it’s cheaper for you to keep
Saving this cheese like niggas sleep
Lito been heated like he been beefing, just been beefing
My haters are paper, they both increase
Making them faces, [?] me

Grinded up a check, naw they don’t like that
Yeah I fucked that bitch but I wouldn’t wife that
Change up for the fame, no I ain’t with that
I just came here for my change, just let me get that
Grinded up a check, naw they don’t like that
Yeah I fucked that bitch but I wouldn’t wife that
Change up for the fame, no I ain’t with that
I just came here for my change, just let me get that
Grinded up a check, naw they don’t like that
Yeah I fucked that bitch but I wouldn’t wife that
Change up for the fame, no I ain’t with that
I just came here for my change, just let me get that
