Intro

(Verse 1: Starlito)
Im thinkin' bout quittin'
Im drinkin, im sippin'
That lean got me trippin'
I stay off them phones
Watching the news while cleaning my pistol
Can't get any drank then im sick
It got me fienin' & twitchin'
I need intervention
Addict behavior
Still after this paper
Rap till I make it'
Stash it or save it
They taxin' im payin'
A stack? Thats okay
Just make sure it got the seal on it
Oh it dont? it got ????
Said he'll take 8?
Fuck it I still want it
Been up this last 48 straight
But im still on it
Like fuck it forreal I ain't fuckin with them pills homie
(AHHHHH) What the fuck? It just spilled on me (echo)
