[Intro-Starlito]
Check, check, cash
Told you niggas we wouldn't use lose
I always wait till the end of century
Just try to crank it all the way up
Ahh you want me to rap?
You want me to wrap? (haha)
You want me to wrap my ass off?
Hahah is that what you want? (is that what you want)
Cause I mean I can sing if you want me too
Y'all smoking without me?
(Ahhh)

[Verse 1-Satrlito]
Club level seats, Toyota Sienna I'm coolin
Chillin at Killa kyeon house, I first thought about movin
Slippin act, mental wounds form, a 5th with deuce
Trakksounds, quarter sounds track I'm livin I'm movin (Lito)
I speed from police, quick get ride of the tool
I was thuggin so fuckin hard, I admit I was foolish
Tryna get myself right with God, and get rich off this music
And spit that real shit, rappers got these kids disillusion
I wish you well with wealth
And a piece I'm pursuing, they had nobody in the lab
Except the beast I been choosing (Lito)
I woke up yesterday, guess what? they had me on the news in Indian
Fucking with  Lil E and his crew, Damn
I hate I ever made that street shit look cool, (I hate it)
I dreamed this back when we was in school (I did)
(remember) I told you niggas we wouldn't lose (I told ya)
I told you niggas we wouldn't lose
Lito
I said that cause I beat on the Rockets
Fell in that bitch with a 7 in my pocket
No, drink having withdraws, like I never deposit (ahh)
Touchdown, get the sack like JJ Watt
Ima space aged Pac
I'm a UGKF, you just passed through
I spent two or three days there (In the trap)
You know my story, from abusing the drank
Then the losin my face, said fuck it and move to the H (yeah)
(losin my face, said fuck it moved to the H)
Yeah

[Sydnee Jane]
Take me down south, make me
I'll find a way out of this place
No more pain
