[Verse 1: Starlito]
Never say I wouldn't take a risk, I ain't a quitter
Anything gold especially for a go-getter
They only speak on legends, who remembers second?
Cry tears, shed blood, I remember sweating
Now I'm eating so much I got indigestion
Niggas got no property, but got ten necklaces, flexin'
I'm done tryna impress you
We stay burning up gas, but cuz buying a Tesla
From in the kitchen whippin', making dubs and dimes out the extras
Gotta love grinding, whatever your hustle, just go perfect it
Grind hard, you can always go harder, make no exceptions
Excuse me, make no excuse, count every blessing, yeah
Remember everybody ain't able
Think about who care about you, everybody ain't haters
Wake up every day feelin' like I"m fresh out
Yeah with my chin up and my chest out
Count a check when I get stressed out

[Chorus: Starlito]
Yeah, I just want it all, I just want it all
Do it for my dogs, all my homies gone
In here going off, just my lonely thoughts
Who you gon' call when your phone is off
Yeah, I just want it all, I just want it all
Do it for my dogs, all my homies gone
In here going off, just my lonely thoughts
Who you gon' call when your phone is off

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
I just wanna ball, man I swear I do
But try me, I still shoot like Hedo Türkoğlu
If this ain't 'bout no money I refuse to take it personal
Red on his way home, I'm on my way soon as I heard the news
Life's a bitch, I keep her legs in the sky
I see future so bright for me, call me Marty McFly
With that iron on me, please don't cross my side of the lion
I got the heart of a giant and the pride of a lion
All I know is the truth and I pour it all in my lines
Lookin' for more of my kind, Lito was all I could find
Auntie prayed for me
Shining brighter than that bitch, you gon' need shades for me
I'd rather die before I quit
I put my mama in the 6 and my sister got pissed
Well, damned if I do, damned if I didn't
I put food on the table and pans in the kitchen
And took niggas fishing, tryna keep 'em from landing in prison
But, no good deed goes unpunished, don't miss my homies
He who traded on me over the money 'cause I wouldn't front him
I refuse to take the food from my youngins to feed your hunger
Never save a coward from drowning, he'll pull you under
Just to save himself, some niggas can't take the hand they dealt
They want yours, but even that won't make them hate you less
Meanwhile I'm at home with baby Zoe, waiting patient for her to take a step
Standing like a man until I'm laid to rest, Godspeed

[Chorus: Starlito]
Yeah, I just want it all, I just want it all
Do it for my dogs, all my homies gone
In here going off, just my lonely thoughts
Who you gon' call when your phone is off
Yeah, I just want it all, I just want it all
Do it for my dogs, all my homies gone
In here going off, just my lonely thoughts
Who you gon' call when your phone is off
