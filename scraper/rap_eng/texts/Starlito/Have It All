[Intro]
You can have it all, still might not be enough
You can have it all, still might not be enough
You can have it all, might not be enough
Got no one to call, man who can I trust?
You can have it all

[Verse 1]
Took so many loses, shit I'm due for a win
Keep me off your Live, I don't know who tuning in
Barely talk in private, ain't got too many friends
Only got once to cross me, you won't do it again
I'm just trying not to get caught up, never been a follower
Never seen some many niggas that ain't been to Cali act so Hollywood
Switch up, you probably would, I'm just not into it
Like I might not ever forgive you if we ever got into it
It ain't even pride, all that nice shit'll get your life took
I might not write a hook, shit I could write a book
We all on borrowed time, I ain't given mine to the state
Trying to get up out of these streets, yeah, I'm really trying to escape
Only the grinders relate, still finding my way
She keep saying she love me, but she'll lie to your face
Same homies that owe you disown you like they don't know you
I been to Minnesota, I promise the streets colder

[Chorus]
You can have it all, still might not be enough
You can have it all, still might not be enough
You can have it all, you can have it all
Got no one to call, man who can I trust?

[Verse 2]
Give me the memories and experiences over possessions
Taking designer drugs got me name-brand depression
Tensions tend to get quicker than Tussionex suspension
Touching this legal tender, heard my fucking ex was on Tinder
Lat seen on her snap, talking 'bout something I don't remember
Got me riding with fire extinguishers, I don't want to rekindle
Humble, but in my feelings, still remember the fundamentals
Stumbled up on a million from mumbling on instrumentals
No sweat dripping, won't step in it, won't catch me slipping
Still sad in that BMW with an extra extension
They watching they cell phones instead of television
I'm watching you watching me, paranoia, got a weapon on me

[Chorus]
You can have it all, still might not be enough
You can have it all, still might not be enough
You can have it all, you can have it all
Got no one to call, man who can I trust?
You can have it all, still might not be enough
You can have it all, still might not be enough
You can have it all, you can have it all
Got no one to call, man who can I trust?

[Verse 3]
Boxed into a persona, you lost yourself
And it hurt like hell, probably feel like you failed
Critics won't be happy 'til you sitting in a cell
Or they kill you for real, or your kidneys done failed
It's really deeper than us, I hope your kids doing well
And your mom and them straight, and the bills never late
I do this for the grinders, but the real gon' relate
Did it out of love, guess what, they still gon' hate
You can have it all if you willing to wait
Half a mil in a pillow case, now he appealing his case
From a neighborhood hero to this villain I play
I remember counting a hundred thousand and just feeling okay

[Outro]
You can have it all
You can have it, you can have it all
Got no one to call, man who can I trust?
You can have it all
Got no one to call, man who can I trust?
At war with myself
