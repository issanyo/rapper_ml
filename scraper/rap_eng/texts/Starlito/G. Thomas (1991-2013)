[Intro: Starlito]
They ain't gon feel you till they kill you
Top 5 dead or alive one of the realest
'Lito

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Started out on free lunch
Came a long way from fucking up my re-up
Closet full of free adidas
4G my phone and my features
I take 35, they marked ya I took it personal
Wrote a third verse to eyes closed
Talking to Doe praying for tip
Might seem sacrilegious for saying it but my faith in my clip
Went on tour twenty days straight FNH on my hip
If a nigga play with Gates or with Trip lets just say ill flip
When you get money trouble tend to come your way
I wasn't humble enough to run the other way call it foolish pride
If I let you trick me out my spot that's just like suicide
Then they asked me do you wanna ride and it was do or die
Still remember young buck tryna convince me otherwise
I just damn near watched my brother died
Got no choice but to slide
When I was 22 I probably coulda woulda shoulda died
Over some bullshit local beef I should've put aside
That's why Glenn Thomas story mean so much to me
Feel like im looking in a mirror and its fucking with me
Yo gotti nor birdman couldn't do nothing for me
I ain't dissing him im just exposing my flaws
Prolly could have sold it cos im dope and im raw
My hearts been froze its still cold I just hope it unthaw
Focused in thought I wrote this for Doe and for y'all


How I feel is how I felt and I dont feel niggas
They ain't gon feel you till they kill you
This the ordinary life of a G
RIP Doe B
How I feel is how I felt and I don't feel niggas

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
How I feel is how I felt and I don't feel nothing
I made more than half a mill and we still struggling
I balled out and took losses never did budget
We all know that almost and finna never did nothing
Tryna keep my hands out the trap but my ribs touching
Handful of niggas rooting for me but I can't trust them
Still can't see my babies so I can't function
Meanwhile I stand like a man and I ain't bugging
Caught my line of scrimmage like I ain't busting
See if you survive, please don't blow my high
Under the influence of fast money and easy bitches
Only conscience that I ever had was Jimmy the cricket
I asked God for answers and all I heard was crickets
And then I heard Jeezy tell me lets get it
Close your mouth over your eyes bitch bear witness
Friends and foes I keep them both at a fair distance
You see a mans true character once he fall off
Same time I met puff I met Bubba Sparxxx
Shout out to Bubba I'm forever indebted
My life is like a movie but I can't go back and edit
I'm sorry mama I promised it wouldn't change me
But the pain took its toll and left my veins cold
I lost my mind from tryna gain control
And I'm a rider yes that's even if I drove
Word to Doe, God speed
