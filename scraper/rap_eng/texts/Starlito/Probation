[Hook: MoneyBagg Yo]
I sip that drink ‘cause it taste good
I fucked that bitch ‘cause she look good
In your city throwin’ up my hood
They like he goin’ crazy
She tryna get with me now
But I’m like no baby
She can’t get the dick right now
Shawty on probation
She on my social sites, I had to turn off my location
She tell me she wanna play doctor but I ain’t got no patience
Took the keys to the whip, had to put her on probation
No reply when she be texting me, that bitch on probation

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Probably pay for you school ‘fore I buy you a bag
I’m grinding, I’m gettin’ it, ho why is you mad?
Why won’t you stay by my side like my strap?
Keep it real like my mom, I might buy you a Jag
Lito and MoneyBagg, it’s a whole lot of hundreds stacked
I know my old bitch sad
Cause I just drove right past in somethin’ real fast
Two twenty-five on the dash
Grind like I’m down to my last
I was just tryna get the cash
You was tryna wine and dine, bubble bath
I was tryna turn a nine to an L
I want this shit back
Naw I don’t lie in my raps
All you gon’ find is the facts
Last time I signed it was eleven twenty-nine for a pack
Consignment a dick (goddamn)
Right back on probation
Like I did your old lady
Lito, I’m realer
Plus I’m a dealer, that’s why I just poke her face
Damn that ho crazy
Now that bitch so crazy
Still trappin’ with open cases
I just bought me a four of that Actavis
For like five hundred, actually four eighty

She tell me she wanna play doctor but I ain’t got no patience

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
I was fuckin’ with this stupid lil broad
Didn’t know how to play her part
Just fuckin’ but she got her feelings involved
Put her on probation like she caught her first charge
Bagg and Starlito, you know we grind hard
You know we don’t chase ‘em
I gave that bitch some dope dick from the back
Had that ass rotatin’
Then I told her I’m straight, I’m good
Me and you a dead situation
We can’t fuck a whole conversation
I just put your ass on probation
