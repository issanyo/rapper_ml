[Intro: Starlito]
Yeah
I hear it, I ain't listening though
Lito (Lito)
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Damn, ah
I mean I was raised by OGs, you was raised by IG
Quick question, what would you do? I mean, what you would you have done
For real, fuck it, ah

[Chorus: Starlito]
These niggas tryna trick me out my spot
That's why I'ma give it all I got
You bitches wasn't saying shit when I wasn't hot
But I ain't tripping, keep my distance
Just keep gettin' all this guap
And keep an extra clip for all my Glocks
These niggas tryna trick me out my spot
That's why I'ma give it all I got
You bitches wasn't saying shit when I wasn't hot
But I ain't tripping, keep my distance
Just keep gettin' all this guap
And keep an extra clip for all my Glocks

[Verse 1: Tha Landlord]
Ayy look, blood in my eyes, pain in my veins
You an undercover snitch, I can't bang what you bang
I can never sacrifice the gang for some fame
Not to mention that you changed for some change
Niggas die over posts they make when they get high
They gave my nigga forty without talking to his moms
And we was only kids but we heard what we did
My niggas say he ain't eat the first five years
'Cause it's fake love everywhere, so hell yeah it's up there
Never shoot up in the sky 'cause I got homies up there
Laurie Street like quicksand, it's some niggas stuck there
City full of hate, you can't find a piece of love there
Pockets full of you know, colors like Uno
Money have them killers on your head like NuGrow
Two long braids got me feeling like I'm Uso
Yeah you got some cool dough but that don't make you cool though

[Chorus: Starlito]
These niggas tryna trick me out my spot
That's why I'ma give it all I got
You bitches wasn't saying shit when I wasn't hot
But I ain't tripping, keep my distance
Just keep gettin' all this guap
And keep an extra clip for all my Glocks
These niggas tryna trick me out my spot
That's why I'ma give it all I got
You bitches wasn't saying shit when I wasn't hot
But I ain't tripping, keep my distance
Just keep gettin' all this guap
And keep an extra clip for all my Glocks

[Verse 2: Mob Squad Nard]
These bitches know I ain't faking
On point with financial shit, I ain't stressing
How in the fuck you gon' play me like I ain't legend
I'm a five K one killer, bite the bullet, bitch I ain't telling
And I got three kids to feed, this shit G, lil bitch I ain't flexing
I can't let you trick me off these streets, I'ma switch up direction
With an extra clip extension, go deep for that interception
You only real as the gang you get
I been thumbing through that check, making them sweat
Every time you pull up in these bricks have on your weapon
Nigga only peep the message, they don't ever see your progression
Your closest niggas laugh when you're down, they blockin' your blessings
How the fuck you say you love me, bitch you ain't loving yourself
You in the L's you only fuck with me 'cause I'm out here with that check up
I see you tryna outdo me, me on this beat in one word is abusive
Been tryna trick me out my spot since I was the line leader in school
This shit colossal now, I just took a jail call from my partner
He said they hate to see dollars and they hostile
Bruh these niggas tryna trick me out my spot

[Chorus: Starlito]
These niggas tryna trick me out my spot
That's why I'ma give it all I got
You bitches wasn't saying shit when I wasn't hot
But I ain't tripping, keep my distance
Just keep gettin' all this guap
And keep an extra clip for all my Glocks
These niggas tryna trick me out my spot
That's why I'ma give it all I got
You bitches wasn't saying shit when I wasn't hot
But I ain't tripping, keep my distance
Just keep gettin' all this guap
And keep an extra clip for all my Glocks, bitch, ah
