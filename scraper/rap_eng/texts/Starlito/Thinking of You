[Verse 1:]
Got this worsome ass bitch
Always go through my shit
My phone passcode, my pin number
Bitch you could've been rich
Hacked all of my passwords
Called her every bad word I could think of
And in the blink of an eye, we're eye liner fucking
Make up sex
Wake up weekly to break up texts
Just cause some girl in yo beauty shop
Say that I fucked my ex
Well, let me ask you this
How she know?
I mean, how she know you?
And how she know me?
And how she know, you know me
You know these hoes be..
Nosey, Messy, they wanna see you stressing
Cause they done missed they blessings
I got a suggestion, don't ask me no questions BITCH!

[Hook:]
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind, think of you all the time

[Talking:]
Ooh, you get on my nerves!
Ion fuck wit you, but I fuck wit ya
Guess I'm stuck wit ya

[Verse 2:]
Soon as I power on my phone
Here go another picture
Then I be like, "What you send that for?"
She say, "Because I miss you"
Aww, It probably sounding good to another nigga
Send her a picture back of 37 racks and a couple of pistols
I'mma thug nigga, owe it all to my plug nigga
And shout out to my scale
She ain't tell when we was in cuffs nigga
That's why I'm stuck wit her
That's a real bitch
But what about this other bullshit
I gotta deal wit
Pulling up, unannounced
Interupting at the studio
Tweeting my fans, calling em groupie hoes
Ion wanna go through this no moe
STUPID HOE!

[Hook:]
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind, think of you all the time

[Talking:]
I mean what did you expect?
Ion give a fuck!

[Verse 3:]
What did you expect?
First night we met
I said "Hi, I'm Lito!"
You introduced me to yo neck
Ain't even know yo name
I was hitting it from the back
And ain't too much remember
I was on liquor and a sack
I just be kicking it how I be kicking it
Tagged me in a pic
And I admit that you look different
After the 14th voicemail
Well, I stopped listenin'
And just cause I'm ignoring you
Doesn't mean I'm ignorant
You belligerent, insignificant, typical-chick, hypocrite
That's why I called you BITCH!
And I meant that shit

[Hook:]
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
All I do is think of you, day and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind, think oft you all the time

[Talking]
Lito!
BITCH!
HOE!
QUIT CALLIN MY PHONE TOO!
