Looking in my eyes, how you lie like that
I call, you text back, why you reply like that
In front of all of your friends talkin fly like that
Sassy, but still classy, just how I like that
Told me meet you at the spot for a nightcap
And it was just me at the spot feeling like I might snap
Wake up to a long e-mail, but I ain't write back
In fact, you can print it out on paper and ignite that
Yeah, let it burn like Mr. Raymond
See yourself in the frame, look how clear the picture's painted
We don't communicate as if we speak a different language
They say that love is unselfish, well, this just ain't it
I don't know how many times that I came back to you
But it's either me or them streets, you gon' have to choose
If you even hesitate, I know, that will do
You say you love me and how I wish that were true
Fuck you mean, hell you mean, you lyin'
How am I to believe you tryin'
Cupid shoots for the heart, that means he aims to kill
Your lies penetrate my soul, if you won't, don't say you will
