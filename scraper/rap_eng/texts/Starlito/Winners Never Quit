[Chorus: Kam Franklin]
Winners never quit, winners never quit
That's a fact you can't deny
Winners never quit, winners never quit
So I must go win until I die

[Intro: Starlito]
They say karma's a bitch, I say karma's a mirror

[Verse: Starlito]
Just took a loss but it wasn't my last
You gon' get passed, this ain't gon' last
Look back on my past, sometimes I laugh
Seems like I was happy when I ain't have shit
Don't dwell on it
Long as you don't give up then you won't fail homie
People with the most to say when they don't even know me
People that's supposed to love me, they don't even show it
Call me when you need me, I'ma pay it like I owe it
Oh you don't wanna ride, well either way I gotta go
We'll pray for your nigga though
You must think this paper gon' wait for a nigga, no
I fell asleep counting a roll, I'ma wake up and get some more
Making a living for sure but wanna make a killing, you know
I take a million or more, make 'em feel in their soul
Break a seal and get throwed or take a pill and get loaded
A tranquil feeling well up, you gon' wake up feeling your lowest
Migraines from dehydration
What about delusion and hallucination
Oh why you mad, you must be constipated
Me and my conscious having a conversation
You full of that dope, driving your mama crazy
Soul searching, soul searching, I quit cold turkey
I made thirty, old soul in an old jersey
Living illegal, like I ain't wanna grow up neither
We need some leaders
Who else you know gon' show our people?
Especially in the streets I'm seeking peace 'cause lord knows I need it
I once felt hopeless and defeated, yeah I know it ain't easy
Gotta stay focused, try to cope with it or let it go
And you gon' get over this, it's just a season

[Chorus: Kam Franklin]
Just because the sun is shining doesn't mean that
My worst days are gone
But if the bets are on me then I know that
I'm gonna finish strong, because
Winners never quit, winners never quit
That's a fact you can't deny
Winners never quit, winners never quit
So I must go win until I die
Just because the sun is shining doesn't mean that
My worst days are gone
But if the bets are on me then I know that
I'm gonna finish strong, because
Winners never quit, winners never quit
That's a fact you can't deny
Winners never quit, winners never quit

[Outro: Kam Franklin]
I always have you, even on my worst days
I know, I know, I know
