[Hook: Young Buck]
'Bout that time that we push the line
Pour all my pain away and lose my mind
Put down my K today and shoot my nine
Bitch what you buyin', all i wanna do is crime
Let's get this money now we losin' time
Wake up with bricks, all he do is can shine
Might take your bitch so now your bitch is mine
We with the shit, all we wanna do is crime

Verse 1:
