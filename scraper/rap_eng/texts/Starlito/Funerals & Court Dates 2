[Intro]
I was out there
I spent millions of dollars
So you ain't talkin' just to some nigga
You talkin' to somebody who was ready to die, okay?
That's who you talking to
So you waste my time and insult me, tell me about MJ, that's nice
There's a whole lot of people out here
That had people give their money

[Verse 1]
Second dirty urine, then a failure to appear
Man look like he gon' have to sit in jail for 'bout a year
He was about to get a deal and that derailed his whole career
Sitting in the fucking cell like what the fuck I'm doing here?
I ain't never did no time, hope they can't tell I'm new in here
Say you gotta pick a side, it's either red or blue in here
It's too late to be scared, straight better not shed a tear
Face your fear, you a street nigga, I thought you made that clear
I might cut a guy life for all of that sheisty shit I lived through
Seen that shit so many times don't even feel original
A t-shirt, an IG post, and a candlelight vigil
Point you out in court or identify you at the morgue, like
Oh, it is you!

[Chorus]
Funerals and court dates too, that's all we got to look forward to
The only time we wear a suit, it's fucked up but yeah it's true
Niggas dying, getting time, mamas crying, yeah what's new?
Don't nobody give a fuck, only person care is you
Funerals and court dates too, that's all we got to look forward to
The only time we wear a suit, it's fucked up but yeah it's true
Niggas dying, getting time, mamas crying, yeah what's new?
Don't nobody give a fuck, only person care is you

[Verse 2]
Who gon' raise your kids homie?
Son turned to his big homie
Daughter just might run to that same nigga when she get lonely
Babies having babies, baby daddies sitting in prison
They just sentenced dog
Fifteen years of visit and fifteen minute calls
That's where they tryna send us all
Kill us off with fentanyl
Same niggas that send you off
When it's on they ain't getting involved
Caught him with his drawers down
Draw down, caught him with his broad
Now it's all out war, when y'all go out they gon' be gettin' at y'all
This shit a cycle, try to break it, I went pyscho
All my paper gettin' recycled 'cause I ain't slavin' for no white folks
Your favorite rapper go to jail, that's fucked up
The label probably hyped though
And they gon' break the bank if one these haters take his life, that's right

[Chorus]
Funerals and court dates too, that's all we got to look forward to
The only time we wear a suit, it's fucked up but yeah it's true
Niggas dying, getting time, mamas crying, yeah what's new?
Don't nobody give a fuck, only person care is you
Funerals and court dates too, that's all we got to look forward to
The only time we wear a suit, it's fucked up but yeah it's true
Niggas dying, getting time, mamas crying, yeah what's new?
Don't nobody give a fuck, only person care is you
