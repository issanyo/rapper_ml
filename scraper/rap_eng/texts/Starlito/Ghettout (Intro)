[Verse]
I prophesized this five years ago
Two million later, wish I had saved it, least I made it
Wouldn't have got half of that from a label, still want a baby
Feel like when I have one God gon' take me
That's why it's still not on safety, I'm out here daily
I won't approach you like a gentleman if you not a lady
I'm on my own, I got way too many obligations
And I would try to explain it but it's complicated
Never know who's listening so I minimize my conversation
Insomnia, I stay woke
Lying if I say I just want a bankroll
Really just want inner peace, yeah I'm kinda unstable
Lost my mind, it's okay, I'll find it one day
I'm just grinding, still rhyming, 'til I find me somethin' that pay more
Do it for them niggas out on bond 'til they case is closed
Or the students stayin' up studying, either way stay focused
Hard work pays off, I'm sending late notices
Smart player, know the game 'cause I had great coaches
Circumstance, force your hand, choices you make mold you
Pulled over, can't throw it, so I ate them hoes
I don't remember but they say I damn near overdosed
Guess that's water under the bridge and I got over so
Ayy don't compare to all this shit I can't get over
I ain't on that drank no more but I just loaded up my forty-four
For my foes, she say I'm always reaching for my heat
When I be sleep I never hold her close
Rather be with you sweet thang, you my everything
Rather spend my money on anything except for a wedding ring
Number nine Blueprint on repeat, I'll never change
I'm numb inside, loop another beat so I can share this pain
Could get out the struggle, get out my feelings
Nah this isn't hip hop hypnotism
Could get out my business
I just wanna be living when my homies get out of prison
I just wanted to get this out my system, GhettOut
