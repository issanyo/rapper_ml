[Verse]
I'm so anxious, that's genuine, it's anxiety though
So much on my mind, no one to confide in, that's why I wrote this
What's the time zone, is it five or four? I don't know
Up late, wide awake, driving slow, my eyes closed
And hoodie up, sun visor down, I ain't hiding though
Leg up on my competition, picture Desmond Howard with the Heisman pose
Flying out this fine lil ho, even though I know we're incompatible
She on only fuck with ball players and rappers, though I'm the latter it don't matter
I'm too hard to flatter, if I already had her
I wouldn't call or at her, like I used all my data
Rather have the love, earned all my respect, turned into a check
In order to survive, learned not to regret
Just accept the shit and move on, except for when it's you
'Cause I guess the feeling too strong, I feel weak
Light-headed, that's this backwood
Quit asking if I'm good, nah
I'm misunderstood, still tryna get out the hood
Well, grind and get out for good
And if I thought that I could change maybe I would
It's getting easier to say no, I'm probably giving away more
Than I spent on myself, it didn't give me no wealth, dependent on help
I wasted so much time it feel like it ain't much left
So I made up my mind and I'm taking what's mine
Baby I'm fine, maybe I'm lying
Make these niggas pay me on time

[Outro]
Taking this shit two days at a time
Sleep too close to the iron
Insomnia addict, too gravity to define
What time is it?
Is it four or five?
