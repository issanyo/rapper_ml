[Intro: Starlito]

We gone free Big Guy & Red Dot on this one

[Verse 1: Starlito]

Them niggas ain't us, that's the same reason they hating
I'm just like you my nigga, only difference I'm not waiting on nobody for nothing,
Either they riding or it's fuck em! I promise all I think about is
Pussy & money, that's my influence, I do what the fuck I want
When I want to do it, Real ass nigga dawg don't even mention my music
I advise only the real ride to it, they try but I do it,
Oh, I ain't introduce myself my bad, It's Lito
I do it bigger they the iPhone I'm the iPad
Once i shoot this bitch off a tripod, can't stop the bleeding
Better try a pad.... ol' pussy ass nigga
I could've been done through my life away, I guess God spared me
I'm rapping with hell's fury, ain't none of this imaginary
I'm at war with myself, so nigga fuck you I'm at war with myself
Idk what to do, I'm at war with myself

[Inerlude: Starlito]

Before I go any further, let me ask you this
What satisfies you, what would you be satisfied by?
I mean i've given my best, had sat on
Spit back, as if it wasn't my original thought
I mean the streets held my mind captive for so long
It don't matter what label you place on me
Gifted, goofy, whatever, I'm bold I'm honest
This just how I solve it, I'm gone rap
I'm gone get back to that,Cause that's what I'm here for
Right now, but.. b-but i hope you find you a purpose
Cause it's a lot of motherfuckers that's lost
And I say that meaning not knowing where they going
And not winning even by Charlie Sheen standards
I get high, but sometimes (Nigga Fuck You) other times I get even lower

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I wake up grab the tool, before I hit the snooze, Rather be on MTV
Shidd I done did the news, guess we was never cool,don't get this shit confused
Don't want to fit in your shoes, if it's little me & bigger you
That's fine, i was still riding, i was just trying to get what was mine
Wish niggas stop lying , cause my niggas keep dying
& the way the state been giving out time, to a nigga that's rich
Ain't gotta touch shit, I ain't gotta touch shit
Might not mean nothing, but I'm living out my rhymes, forget it I resign
In just they print it I ain't say resign...
Niggas might not owe me nothing, but until the rap game show me different I'm fine
Look I ain't gotta rhyme, & I don't give a fuck if I ain't gotta dime
I ain't gotta stand in line, got the kind of talent you should be trying to sign
Not trying to rob, & if I'm not unsigned then it's a glitch in the matrix
& I don't wanna talk, & to my nigga Red Dot fuck it, I'm going off
I'm at war with myself,I'm at war with myself.. (think i give a fuck about you)
