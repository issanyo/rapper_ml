Talking : Starlito
I think niggas just be forgetting to breathe sometimes. Just inhale, exhale
Focus on that first

Verse 1: Starlito
I came from nothing
Anything’s better than that
Anything’s better than going backwards
Real rap
Fucking right I rap for them racks
I’m still strapped
Anything goes always
The real gone feel that
A lot of times in the trap
You can feel trapped
I was told if he won’t hustle
He’ll steal, that still fact
Like when the nigga you thought was real
Now you feel like he a rat
It’s kill or be killed
Weigh your feelings up in a bag
Dealing is in the past
Steal or go get that sack
Legitimate but I ain’t finna attack
Just hit me fifty racks
Flipping stack
Flip, flipping stacks (flipping stacks)
But once they get a lil money
You know how niggas act
I ain’t never had shit
Consider that
I probably lost like twenty different gats
Threw a few running from the laws
Some we ditch had the digits scratched off
Vaguely remember that
Don’t make me get in to that
Please

Verse 2: Don Trip
I signed a deal
Ain’t want it
I walked away with 290
36 months with no album
But fuck it
I ain’t complaining
Sometimes I hate being famous
Don’t go nowhere with no banger
That’s why I really hate flying
Cause I can’t fly with the iron
Ain’t no permit
This shit I got shoot too many times
With all this shit on my mind
Still tell my bitch I’m just fine
Who am I kidding
I’m lying
But I can’t take a bow
Wear that paint on my face
Only my kids see me smile
I went on tour with Wale
Went on tour with The Game
Without a cent to my name
That when everything changed
I said fuck it
I was better off hustling
It was all or nothing
I did this all for nothing
I’m ready for war like Custer
On my last stand
At the telly with that sack and a mac 10
That and a thirty round Glock
You know how macs jam
Or maybe you don’t
You know when I’m on
I was born in hell
And I plan on taking it home
Who coming with me
God speed

[Speaking: Yo Gotti]
Yea
Like, I remember my first time I met Trip
I was like I gotta introduce you to Star
Like you niggas sound good together
Yall go hard
So I see yall niggas do yall thang
Man, I’m just proud of you
You heard me

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
In ’99 nigga had his eyes on the trap table
In 2000 nigga started rapping
Got my on label
Sold birds got my own paper
Had my own gun
And my own shooters
For my own haters
Bought my own acres
I can drug talk you
I can real estate you
I can architect you a chrome tec
Try to build a team  like I build a house
You know slab, bricks then cashing out
Lito, tell these niggas where you know me from
Trip, tell these niggas how you met an nigga
First, a nigga put you on a tour bus
Took you all around the world with a squad of working niggas
If about getting money
I done it
If a nigga bust fire and you got fire
But you don’t bust
You running
You a bitch pussy
You coming
Peep the play
I can see the shit coming
Duck your head
Nigga out the car dumping
Empty clip till his heart stop pumping
Then the laws start coming
Anyway
This just the light flood now
That them neighbors was hardaway
My sister get cars and my bitches bags
On every holiday
My niggas get opportunities
I put them in positions
I done made millions
And I’m still grinding
That’s hustle’s ambition

[Outro: Yo Gotti]
See niggas get lazy once they get money
But see me, it’s like
I never felt rich, I never will
I’m always hungry
Like I get one million, I want ten
Once I get ten, I want twenty
Once I get a twenty piece, I want a thirty clip
It’s what the game is
You know what I’m saying
You gotta be born with this shit
You gotta be motivated
Nigga ain't gotta wake you up to get no money
Nigga you gotta wake with money on your mind
Nigga what you go to sleep thinking about pussy
Oh I forgot
You is a pussy
