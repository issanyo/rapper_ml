(Yeah) Ya cheering Im at the finish line
(Introversion) I'm just wondering is these niggas finish lying
(Hoodrich) Ha, I been up for 56 hours


(Lito) My tolerance high
If it wasn't dollars I'd prolly cry
The biggest understatement I could possibly make is to say it's a lot on my mind
This my last song I don't got that much time
Never would've thought they would've got that much time
Never got to talk to my dawg before he died
Every time they talk man these niggas be lying
Make a living off lying
How you living off lying
Know I'm bout a sack
Yeah, Lawrence Taylor 56 lil' nigga I'm a giant
I won 56 racks all in one week said fuck it move to Vegas
I smoke 56 grams Monday thru Thursday on my third 28
56 zips and sip three and a half pint yeah a nigga be really leanin
I got 56 bitches still tryna figure out why I be in Phoenix
I miss 56 calls all from my dawg when I woke up Wednesday
They speak to me like "What up Nigga" knowing damn well they don't fuck wit me
New Year's eve average two a week
IDGT nigga true indeed
Between you and me I drink too much lean
Still stay up til bout two in the evening
Two days ago I got too many demons
You would believe it
Insomnia's real I don't do any sleeping
I don't kick it unless Im playing FIFA
Makes no difference won't betray my people
Ain't no Christmas they waiting on Lito (Lito 4x)
[Plies] Ain't no Chrima Bih

Got yo WCW, Sweet Pussy Saturday
(Ain't no christmas bitch)

Stay to myself
Stay by myself
Even if it's hella lonely
Cause heaven knows
You just never know
And I don't need another nigga tellin on me
It's all in my voice you can tell I'm on it
I ain't fuckin with these cell phones
IM GONE!!
