[Intro]
Gave her the D... And even sent the Roses [3x]
But I just keep on getting hurt
I just keep on getting hurt
I'll sleep when I get murked
(Insomnia Addict)

[Verse]
I ain't taking no L's like Nerlens (Nope)
Ballin, I'm fly, like a pelican, Nâ€™awlins
Lyrics so Sharpe gotta catch it like Sterling
No bluffing, I'm calling, I'm all in, I'm balling, I'm balling
Like Spalding
And Rawlings
Darling
Thought it was love, thought I was falling, nah
The thought will be gone by Fall (Ah)
But she thought I was all of that, until August
Smoking and drinking, I love this shit
Pants sagging, I'm clutching, I'm thugging bitch
Before I paid a publicist I did a scholarship
Still getting money with some niggas I went to college with
On my life! Niggas made a whole lot of attempts, on my life
I promise not to slip
Probably done cried myself to sleep more times than I done mentioned
That's why I'm riding around, Thirty something hollow tips
And a dirty gun with[?] zipper, to scratch off like a lotto ticket
(Skkrrrtt, Skkrrrtt, Skkrrrtt)
I'm so G, probably die out'chere, tryna be me
Inching up on 500K, said goodbye to privacy
Rider in my driver seat
Me, myself, my heater, my drink
Put a hole in ya head just to see what you think
Fuck nigga I'm a G, what you think? (Lito!)
Keep it 100, Like my Porshe and on my publishing
Shawty so slutty, like a contortionist, it's lust
It's just...
I know she lying!
But it sounds so good...
I met this person
At this place
With a thing
Now I understood...

So no need to explain (no need to explain)
I'm so deep in the game (so deep in the game)
I need cleats
Had to get it out the mud so to speak
Like feet from the rain...
Speaking of the drank
Queen Latifah, flavor like Khadijah
Living single
Roll full of paper
Like a Khalifa
That reefer got me in a sleeper
Aaaaaa, I can't sleep though

Nah
