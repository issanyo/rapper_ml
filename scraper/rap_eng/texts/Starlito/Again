[Intro-Starlito]
I just want, I want to let it build up til they damn near forget then I'm gonna come in rappin
Fried turkey
Re-up and do it again, re-up and do it again, re-up and do it again

[Verse 1-Starlito]
(ahhh, Lito)
I'm IND, nah, I don't depend on em
If you don't put in on it then you ain't my friend
I just be counting these ends, lonely, updating my Benz
Couple of my exes have twins now but I wasn't in on it
Just be thinking out loud, put down this drink is on
Don't need no niggas around, me and my bitch out of town
I left a zip at the house, it's about ten different flavors
Yeah, I been skimping them pounds

Yeah, re-up and do it again

Over and over again, it drove me psycho
That paper got recycled, now my neighbors all white folks
Want granddaddy purp, and OG
I got an old soul, Snooze me that's a no go. I got a fo-fo. For my fo's I'm loco
Lead talk, tell me something I don't know
Glock got a red light but I don't. I'm on go, I'm on that dro
Fuck a piss test. Fuck a PO case, cause if I know female artist they might try to fuck the CEO
You still ain't real, and I don't give a fuck what your CD sold. It's lead talk, going for the gusto
You see before your eyes know the skies
No mams, don't pose when it flash, cause that's your ass, bang. Shute like my last name, (Yeah) trash bag gang
Got a bunch of niggas that don't rap, still doing the same thing. They camera shy, don't talk on phones
I love when it ring, I'm thuggin, They entertainer, I'm in the game
(Game)

Yeah, just re-up and do it again (x4)

Let me hear that
