Ahhhhh, cold turkey

[Chorus]
It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards
Anything's better than going backwards
It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards
Consider it not a failure, it was more of a practice
It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards
Not a quitter at all but I'm giving up bad habits like
Women with hidden agendas and better bitches in general

I'm being specific, nothing subliminal
Shawty so fly, might jet her out on a red eye
I want that face to face, that eye to eye
Since they never lie
Normally I don't do this, but she sweeter than a chest pie
Still remember meeting her, leaving up out of Best Buy
I was in my lolo slick, wishing I brought my best out
Big chain, sticking my chest out
As if I'm [?] to the [?]
Look at her now, batting her eyes
Ain't shy but she acting surprised
All the while, capitalizing in the back of her mind
Gold digging hoes digging holes in a nigga's soul
Pretending like I didn't notice getting old
On my Instagram straight flexing
Half naked, you get the picture though
You met her off of twitter, how you expect her to play a different role?
Always dying for attention, If I ever would've mentioned
Addicted to how I'm getting it, might require an intervention
[?] You ain't got protection?
Ain't this the same bitch that screen-shot your messages?
Conscience intervened, got me second guessing
Searching for a hidden camera like a weapon
Look, look-check this out
Turn that phone off, ride with me to the store, let's go
I'mma be damned if I have a baby by this ho

[Chorus]
[No, no, no]
It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards
Ah, that's better than going backwards
It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards
Consider it not a failure, it was more of a practice
It's difficult starting over, but that's better than going backwards
Not a quitter at all but I'm giving up bad habits
Like niggas with hidden agendas and bitches with bad attitude [up]
I'm sorry, that was rude

Waking up disgusted with somebodies misses
Telling my gal more lies than a politician
Lucky her, she's stuck at home watching the chillen
While I'm in another city with a flock of bitches
She know I'mma dog, she's just being optimistic
But she was down when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I should marry her I know
Instead I'll be taking something home after the show
They screaming with their titties out, all in the front row
I'm trying to bob and weave, all the pussy that's being thrown
Sorry, it's probably too late for an apology
I'm not in getting head like I enrolled in cosmetology
I can't help the thought of it
Am I the kind of man I want my daughters with?
Knocking 30, still talking baller shit
I can't say I'm proud of it
One can only hope, that my daughters never pay for all the hearts they father broke
Notchhh

[Chorus]
It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards
Anything's better than going backwards
It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards
Consider it not a failure, it was more of a practice
It's difficult starting over, that's better than going backwards
Anything's better than going backwards
Not a quitter at all but I'm giving up bad habits
Cold Turkey
