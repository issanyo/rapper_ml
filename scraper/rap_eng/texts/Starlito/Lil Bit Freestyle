[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Gone head blame it on tha alcohol
I'm wid it
Her girlfriend beggin' her to pass the balls
I'ont think ya get it
My flow so dumb might fuck a bitch silly
If she figure i'm trickin'
She retarded, she lost it
One more round we been at it all night
Got damn! Bitch you oughtta be exhausted

[Verse 2: Starlito]
She gotta be alot of things to rock with me
And i'm just bein' boss
Police prolly follow me i'm cautious
Runnin' on fumes, bout to get some mo' gas
What happen to the last bag
Hashtag, somebody bought it (pounds)
I'm the type to get ya number, don't call it
Don't mind, don't matter if ya d.m
Sexy lil bitch, ima text tha lil bitch
Don't FaceTime me, i'm right next to my bitch

[Verse 3: Don Trip]
I been up for two days but I slept wit my bitch
So fine you would give your whole check to my bitch
Inna middle of the club wit a weapon on my hip
Now i'm goin home to change, got a scuff on my kicks
Please never mind all da weaponry
I know i'm 'posed to chill cuz i'm sort of a celebrity
Got so many babies I should go get a vasectomy
Pocket full of c-notes I don't know a single melody
Check it, car so smart might let it self-park
Can't see me inside, say my windows to dark

[Verse 4: Starlito]
Benihana dinner tell em send another fork
Fn got an extension since my temper so short
Lyin' to myself like I ain't sippin no more
Since '04 wishin' that I didn't go to war
Shell shocked shorty
On tha block with that .40
Like Shawn Kemp in '94
NBA jam yea i'm juiced up
2 on 2 man can't nobody see us
Come from tha era of the freeze cup
People got me scared to even re-up
Ima big dawg, your a teacup
Stepbrothers 3 gon' fuck tha streets up

[Don Trip]
Ya lil mutt you barkin' up the wrong tree trunk
Me and star runnin' over rappers like a speed bump

[Starlito]
An we still hungry
Remember back when it was free lunch
Rappin' in tha cafeteria, wrapped up on a half a mil
I ain't talkin' snacks, i'm tryna stack an holla fuck ya contract
Now I ain't neva lookin' back and that's just how I feel

[Don Trip]
Came a long way we stashin' pounds in tha cavalier
Still down to shoot like a camera reel
Independent nigga, makin' independent money
Make a hata so sick he need chamomile

[Starlito]
Panamera Porsche thanks to Manny Pacquiao
Meant to save money ("say money" as in money mayweather?)
Mothers Day I bought my mommas house
K-Camp Yea he keep it one thou' wow
June 23 that nigga Trip puttin' his album out
