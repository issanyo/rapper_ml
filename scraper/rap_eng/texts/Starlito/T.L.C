[Intro: Starlito]
TLC
Think laugh cry
Starlito

[Hook: Starlito]
Even though I haven't seen you lately
Want you to know that I appreciate you
Wish we were better at communicating
Either way your still my motivation

[Verse 1: Starlito]
I remember you told me to rap about love
Because that's the only thing that lasts forever
What you give a person that wants for nothing
Just know that you can ask for whatever
My last or whatever
I know it makes you happy to see me doing better
But I wrote this song instead of roses when your gone
I love you, had to tell you
And I still can't quite get passed my past
Living too fast
Many nights, long talks frustrated and sad
Blamin' my dad
I'd give everything all the change and the cash
Just to change up the crash
Just to lighten your load
Just like for you to know that I love your soul
Grand Momma

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I remember when you told me it's okay to cry
Lost Lil ??? and I lost my mind
Popped all them pills, thought I wanted to die
My darkest times taught me to shine
Just talked to my dog he partially blind
But his spirit's high and his heart is divine
I told him he motivate me
Said we grow up and grow ungrateful
And I know I be so impatient
Good things come to those who wait
I ain't believe you so I ain't wait
And I almost ain't make it
Kinda crazy, I wouldn't blame her if your Momma hates me
Chasin' these commas I'm a promise breaker
Solve our drama simple conversation
Now our problems complicated
I'm sorry I promise I'm the personification of guilt, regret
Gotta learn not to expect
Slowly learning how to accept
Still hoping for the best, it ain't over yet

[Hook]

[Outro: Starlito]
Real rap I might have shed a tear in 2000 writing this song
But ain't no shame in my pain
Might have just not have been this
Either way it had to come out one or another
