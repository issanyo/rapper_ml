[Intro]
Sell a whole lot of work, yeah, yeah
You recording?
Grind hard
I always say that shit
Real rap, I don't never lie

[Verse 1]
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back
Then I finally got tired of that
Run it up 'til it stack
Stack it 'til you need another stash
Got a bank card and a duffel bag
Don't sleep where I hustle at
Be careful who you show too much
I seen too much, was way too young
My heart too cold to trust
It's pressure, you gon' fold or what?
This pressure that I'm rollin' up
Get fresh and gettin' loaded in the club 'fore we was old enough
Sold enough to re-up then I blew straight through the profit
That's just breaking even but it's too late, I went shopping
Used to walk around with my life savings in my pocket
And in the projects where any time of day a dice game might get poppin'
Ever lost your legs then got it back as the house man
Came up on a wreck and got a pack from an ounce man
Or hit 'bout eight straight points and went straight to the jeweler
I been gamblin' all my life, man it'll take a nigga through it, for real

[Chorus]
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back

[Verse 2]
Yeah I got a gambling problem, it's a sensistive subject
But I'm goin' all in if I sense that you bluffin'
I was tryna get even, when the odds against me I love it
Independent and winnin', ain't gotta convince you I'm thuggin'
Not to mention I'm hustlin', don't want no attention or nothin'
'Bout my business that's it, 'cause I seen lots of friendships get fucked up
Bought a Benz 'cause I lucked up, finally legit
Fine lil bitch, yeah she grind, she strip
Homie behind the fence grindin' strips
I'm tryna quit saying I'm tryna quit, hah
Flyin' your bitch but I ain't buyin' her shit
Seven hundred dollar shirt, another nine on the kicks
Sell a whole lot of work, how much time you gon' get

[Chorus]
Bet back, lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back
Lost it all, got it back, bet back

[Outro]
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back
Lost it all, got it back
Then I finally got tired of that
Run it up 'til it stack
Stack it 'til you need another stash
Got a bank card and a- ayy you know what?
I never thanked you
