[Intro: B-Rad]
There's some things I can say, but I ain't gon' say
There's some things I can say, but I won't say nothin'
There's some things I can say, but I won't say nothin'
There's some ways I feel, but I
There's some things I can say, but I won't say nothin'
There's some ways that I feel, but I'ma keep frontin'

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Damn, we always argued anyway
You just be trying to act so hard, and it's okay
I forgot who even started it today
Right or wrong, which part you want to play?
Yours or mine, whose heart you gonna break?
I know I'm at least partially to blame
I don't want her, I just let her put a car up in her name
Where your credit card? charge it to the game
I feel ashamed I even started to explain

[Chorus: B-Rad]
There's some things I could say, but I won't say nothin'
There's some ways that I feel, but I'ma keep frontin'
Every time I see the, I want to say somethin'
I know what could happen, if I say somethin'

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Look I'm weird, confrontational when it come to my fears
I'm serious, I got some peers that I ain't spoke to in years
I'm at the bar and everybody know my name like Cheers
Take a shot, watch how it change your career, fuck
I'm in the far left lane and I'm changing my gears
No shame, I left them lames in the rear
Look how my pain disappear
I was feeling salty, ever tasted your tears?
Guilty conscious, dead weight on your spirit
Hate to see my face in the mirror
I want to say it where I make sure you hear it
Let's be clear, patience and faith the only way I got here
And sometimes it take a mistake to make you wake up, period
Love it or hate it, either way I'm sincere (this some sincere shit)

[Chorus: B-Rad]
There's some things I could say, but I won't say nothin'
There's some ways that I feel, but I'ma keep frontin'
Every time I see the, I want to say somethin'
I'ma stay right here, and I'ma be humble

[Verse 3: Starlito]
Yeah, what's real these days?
Sometimes I wonder why it took so long to come up
It don't matter, I'm in this bitch until the sun up
Ninety-nine problems and these niggas they ain't a hundred, I'm one up
I'ma let karma catch all my trespassers
I'm busy chasing this check, I'm gettin' faster
Them niggas making them threats, you hear the laughter?
I was brought up in that life, I don't get caught up in the hype
I got twenty thousand on me, I made all this shit tonight
Even though what we did was wrong, ain't have a thought of livin' right
Until I learn that foolish pride can really cost a nigga his life
Who am I kiddin', it's still on sight
Send a hit from a flight, I met my plug at the fight
Reminisce, young nigga shit, we used to club every night
I was tryna get a bitch but you know cuz and them on sheist
Still run with a bunch of robbers, I promise you don't want no problems

[Chorus: B-Rad]
There's some things I could say, but I won't say nothin'
There's some ways that I feel, but I'ma keep frontin'
Every time I see the, I want to say somethin'
I know what could happen, if I say somethin'
I'ma stay right here, and I'ma be humble

[Outro]
And then, just like that, somebody turned off the rain, and the sun come out
