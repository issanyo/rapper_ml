[Intro]

[Hook: West Hustle Man]
Used to post on the block and sell dope
Running up the clocks we didn't know
(But shit ain't how it used to be)
Remember days playing broke
Praying that my day didn't go slow
(But shit ain't how it used to be)
I hustle to get my folks' out the slums
These young niggas want bodies on they guns
(But shit ain't how it used to be)
I know real rec. real, these 80s babies gonna feel how I feel
(But shit ain't how it used to be)

[Verse 1: West Hustle Man]
Well respected amongst killers and bosses
Sometimes we sat around taking bout killers and losses
Lost a hundred on the road
An onion on the stove
And the dope gang will turn a good guy like Niko
And shit ain't how it used to be
I paid 20 than 23 then they started losing me
I ain't never had no quit in me I started moving green
Then they snatched my nigga C
I gotta be up on my seed
I gotta keep it realer than most
I still sleep with my toast
Can't put no trust in no hoe
That's how I came in the door screaming I f 2-0
And even though I'm a great player I still listen to coach
And my OG taught me everything
Never speak listen to everything
Hunnid pounds off in that chevy thing
Up a T and shoot with the mid range jumper
Same plug on the loud
Loyal spending 9 summers

[Hook: Starlito]
Dope boys used to hate taking pictures
Internet will put them people in your business
(But shit ain't how it used to be)
Remember nights no cash
Praying that tomorrow I bounce back
(But shit ain't how it used to be)
I'm rapping cause I don't want a case
These young niggas want tear drops in they face
(But shit ain't how it used to be)
Real recognize real, these 80s babies gonna feel how I feel
(But shit ain't how it used to be)

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Sometimes I get high and just reminisce
With my niggas get so lit
I don't know how I remember shit
Now I'm into bitches with benefits
Take it back when I was in the bricks
With niggas that was getting bricks
We was on tour buses no tour
On the run on the road yeah
Now my whip and watch yeah they both newer
Streets love a nigga when this coke pure
And you front niggas
But they'll front on you when you going through it
I ain't try to fuck the nigga girl shit we both knew her
How was I supposed to know he was close to her
I thought we was homeboys
Yeah but we both thought
I was taught, never put a hoe before your dawgs
Sometimes I come across as a know it all
Some things I don't know at all
Like if the police involved then no sir I don't recall
That's just my protocol
Real nigga prototype
Ain't no more my type
They just won't know the ride
And I still move in silence
All I know is surviving, that's the code I abide by
No codefendant no cosign
Live life there's no tomorrow
Just don't stop grinding
Never been patient
Granny used to say just take your time
Never give statements
If you catch a case just take your time
Cashville I'm in a whole other state of mind
Looking for it because I can't rewind
Thankful I'm alive
