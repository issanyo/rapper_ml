[Intro-Starlito]
Damn
(Trakksounds)
I think about you when it rains
I think about you when it rains
Yeah

[Verse 1-Starlito]
They say that's God cryin, I say it's angels sweating
I believe in right now, no need to pay no Reverend
Been to about 8 weddings, maybe 50 funerals
A few I couldn't make it too, just barely miss my own
Sometimes I miss my home, home is where the heart is
And I'm homeless, I'm heartless
War with myself, where's the salvation army
Livin two days at a time, 4 days straight on the grind
So much killin in my city, first 48 state of mind
These days, they don't pray to divide forces, they just stay with they 9
Of course its unfortunate, most of the soldiers still stay with moms
Houses get shot up, So many shells from AK's on the lawn
True story, history
My story I based this on

[Chorus-Too Tone] x2
If I told yo where I come from
You wouldn't believe my story
Can't make it up, I made it up, out, where so many have died there, it's hard enough to get by there
It'll make you wonder if God care

[Verse 2-Petty]
Smoke one for the days we made it through
Some days, I think of the ones who didn't
We could've saved a few, but life goes on
Ain't turn sideways, I just turned sideways a brew
Still when it hurts, Ima say the truth, when I'm able too
And that's on everything, and everything ain't made for you
I can't fake the real, if you think you will,then I pray ya do
If you won't something you never had before, gotta break the rules
They say life is crazy, but take it easy, that's crazy too
Ain't no slowing down on this, ain't no holding back
That's crazy too
No turn around, and no turning back, that's crazy too
You gotta take advantage, every chance you get
When you late, you lose
Either play the fool, or you play with fools
You know you hate to choose but that's life

[Chorus-Too Tone] x2
If I told yo where I come from
You wouldn't believe my story
Can't make it up, I made it up, out, where so many have died there, it's hard enough to get by there
It'll make you wonder if God care
