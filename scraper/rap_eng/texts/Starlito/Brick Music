[Chorus: Starlito]
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too

[Verse 1: Trapperman Dale]
'Bout to double up and bubble up
She ain't fuckin', we'll wish her luck
A quarter bird in a dually truck
You ain't never had to scoop it up
A nigga lost it all, had to pick it up
A hundred round with a coolant touch
A nigga hit it, it's a touch and bust
I told them niggas not to shop with us
Serve out the peephole, the G code
Dip from the narcs when I see 'em
I still hang with Block and Lil Duna
We still run through doors with them bands and them heaters
I might catch a play off a beeper
I might cut your head when I see you
I just hit the play from his last
He won't see this lil cat 'til I pull up and meet him
Simmer down, heard the pack in
Mossbird blow your back in
If it's me or you, then it's that then
Sideways with a MAC-10
Scrape the pot, get some blisters
They seem shady to me, I'll stretch 'em
Tryna get to it, watch me stretch it
Got some overs and got back to gettin' it

[Chorus: Starlito]
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too

[Verse 2: Mob Squad Nard]
I'm this bitch with Trapperman Dale, got a half a man player
Don't tell, I'm in the trap tryna unpack a damn bale
Tell me what the fuck I'm gon' do with a half a gram scale
Damn player, kick the door and catch a pack of clam shells, yeah
Quarter boy, I'm really swamp ready
Nigga selling flaca, got the boss ready
Dirty chopper in the bald Chevy
Got the work sittin' on the cart, yeah we got a lot
Yeah we got the soft and rocks, hell yeah we countin' guap
Yeah I'm really in, I ain't never popped off a cop
Hell yeah I got the Glock
Got your baby mama pussy and top
Don't stop, catch it catch it every drop
I was on jigga, swangin' in the trop
With a six-twelve, bang a nigga block
Thank Maco for payin' to flip a tall
Just watch now, Sosa with a mop
Me and Cashville skinny catch a pop
Hustle on, straight finesse a nigga's block, hits back

[Chorus: Starlito]
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
Everybody 'round me tryna get to it
This that go and get a brick music
Duct tape an extra clip to it
Making hits and we takin' hits too
