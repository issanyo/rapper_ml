(Verse 1-Tha Landlord)
I can't be wasting time, I got a point to prove, to who/
What you mean, I'm true to myself
I never asked you, never will
Ill do it myself, these niggas dumb, ill tutor myself
I'm o a roll, but I'm out of bounds I gotta be careful
I'm a Vegas night raider, you know I'm a rebel
I'm in your city, what you scared for/
I just got this glovk to make sure I get to the airport

(Verse 2-Starlito)
Ask me what I care for, I can't even tell no more
People I was there, turn the back so therefore its fuck em
When the love fake, I can't tell a friend from a stranger
I ain't even asked, bro brought me the benz, and a banger
Wish I could pretend its entertainment
Just lost 44 hundred, betting on Cleveland and Thunder
I get even off this teaser, I took eagles and under
I'm in UNLV every summer, now that weed legal I ain't ever leaving
I got a better reason

(Verse 3-Tha Landlord)
Look, I'm just happy to be breathing, I done lost friends
You ain't never had no rep, you always called in
I can tell you a bluff, so throw your cards in
And when its my turn ain't no checking, bitch I'm all in

(Verse 4-Starlito)
Told me what it cost then, what happened?
I bought ten, lost what I brought to spend
Probably do it all again
You niggas loser, fuck I look like letting yall win
And I don't need no shooters, where the fuck yall been

(Verse 5-Tha Landlord)
They couldn't learn the office, so we cut them off, fuck em all
I just talked to Lito, ain't no passing we gon run the ball, yeah
And like a kick off we gon come to yall
Catch up in traffic, make your hummer do a summersault
I sacrificed too much, this shit ain't happen over night
Shit you can spit on the dice, you still gambling with your life
Old folks home, I got grams of the white
If I hand you this chain you better hand me your life

(Verse 6-Starlito)
30 bands on the flight, took my fam to the fight
Waiting on my arrangement, Lawyer say the plan to indicate
I ain't saying that its right, I ain't saying it to excite
Hit Land like where its at, when I was staying with a sprite
Try the act up, tried to tax us
I was grinding backwards (ahhh)
Besides I'm  just a rider disguise has a rapper
When you come out of hiding the liable to jack ya
When on of you niggas drop dead, I might die from laughter
