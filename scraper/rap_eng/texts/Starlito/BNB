(Starlito)
Who got the who got the
Who got the gas cause I got the cash
Tyrna get me a brand new bag
Send the address ima put it in a nab then
I'm pulling up fast

I just lost a grand in a twenty dollar dice game(Fuck)
Guess they be saying a nigga still thugging
Got some bad habits I ain't proud of
Used to sipping syrup I ain't feel nothing
Ready to kill you if I spill some
Distracted by these hoes, need a real one
One thing that's for show man them bills coming
Got a bankroll out them PJ's real huneds (yeah)
One man armed every nigga round me gotta kill for
Me and I ain't gotta worry bout no ear hustling
Can't lie I be lonely than a motherfucker
That's how it is a bunch of homies lost to the
Struggle pay the cost to be a boss but it cost double
Who the fuck gone buy me out if I get in trouble got
The game all wrong think these hoes love you
New year I bought more pistols and more rubbers
Only thing I every told I don't know nothing
Cause I know it's really no justice
Hope my homie get parole when he go up there jammed
In a school zoned in controlled substance
Wrap my own bands up like fuck your budget
No buddy nothing bout the shit low budget
Man I been getting money for a long long time
Still grinding cause a nigga want some more of it

Hook
Give me a bag Ima act brand new
Used to stash all my cash in my shoes
Now I smash real fast in the coupe run it up
Fuck it up get it back is what I do and you

You can have her back nigga you ain't gotta ask

Want a brand new bag

(Don Trip)
Success so sweet I need a bowl of it
Hard cold getting blowed by a snow bunny
I'm so hard to read these days gotta call like
6 motherfuckers to get a hold of me
I been around sense mongoose and dino
A concrete jungle and a marino
I just want a bitch I can trust that don't got a
Booking number in her bio
But any who niggas bite you so hard they
Probably chipped  a tooth I don't condone y'all
Niggas I out wrong y'all niggas got me feeling
Like a shark in a swimming pool
And you niggas is looking like a quick meal
Am I tripping could've sworn I heard the dinner
Bell bitch I got a suppressor on a half
No rocking night vision googles like it's real
Life splinter cell I was quiet like a mouse
Ratting ass nigga get to die like a mouse
In a snake mouth just in case we beefing we'll
Waiting at the door nigga you can get a tip
Like we order take out i'm to motherfucking
Arrogant to hide it captain sally told me I
Must be the flyest I paid thirty dollars for the bag
But it ain't bout the bag it's about what's inside it

Hook
Give me a bag Ima act brand new
Used to stash all my cash in my shoes
Now I smash real fast in the coupe run it up
Fuck it up get it back is what I do and you
Can have her back when i'm through and
You can have her back nigga you ain't gotta ask

Want a brand new bag
