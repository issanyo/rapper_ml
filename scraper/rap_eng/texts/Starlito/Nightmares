I couldn't keep a secret so I told it to a mime
He couldn't keep it either, so he showed it to the blind
Last night I had a dream that my gun jammed
Last blunt, I'm down to just one gram
This is loyalty is everything
I guess I'm dying with my one fam
New year approaches, that means new goals
Less fast food, let the past have my old hoes
Riding through where I used to get my grind on
Then from there I take a 30 minute drive home
That's right I came up
But I'm so proud to say that I ain't change up

[Hook]
If you make it through your nightmares, wake up and you right here
I would say you doing just fine
Well, my team, we street dream, which means
Well, all we do is just grind
Hey, girl where I know you from
I ain't know you was this fine
All the evil shit he been through, freaky shit she into
She gon' have him losing his mind

Got my guap up, that didn't help it
Had some G's on my head like a Packers helmet
Fell asleep, 'noid, wake up, Pakistan, strapped again
So I put cheese on they head, Packers fan
This shit gets deep, see
They really love me and I won't stop 'til I Lambeau Leap
I'm talking leather seats, no roof over me
But for four dollars a piece, yo, I got E
Let 'em shove that trap rap down your throat
So far with no gag reflex, you didn't choke
My G pass will never expire nor get revoked
Seen a chick that I sort of admired, I should've spoke
Trash Bag Gang, call us for the smoke
My homeboy controls the volume, no remote
It's my life as a crime drama
The same shit that my rhymes honor
Turn it up, 'cause I can't turn it down
Chain smoking the loud, remain focused, but how
Turn it up, 'cause I can't turn it down
I'm chain smoking the loud, remain focused, but how

[Hook]

Let me back up to the Packers reference from the last verse
Check my past work, had the passion to rap backwards
Couldn't rewind nor deny the fact that I trap first
So a diss record might get me get the strap
What's worse, the pride, criminal homicide
A threat, if I don't stop with subliminals, I'ma die
Such a way with words, but shorty I'm not a Nas
Before I Ether a nigga, I'ma go Kamikaz
Got people looking at me like I'm a lie
Think I slave for the whips and these chains, Amistad
I'ma stop, but I remind these boys in the hood who they playing with
Lito, you just swinging in the air like Trey and shit
I'm riding on monsters, spraying shit
Waking up, reaching for my K and shit
Scaring my latest lady that I'm laying with
So fuck it, okay I quit
No I don't, I'm sorry
Before you try and Brett Farve me
One team my whole career, Grind Hard, yeah
Star, Bart Starr, call my plays Lombardi
Back to back I can't take no nap
Have nightmares, then I wake up strapped
Talking in my sleep, like weigh that sack
She like, I thought you rapped
I ain't know you sold green

[Hook]
