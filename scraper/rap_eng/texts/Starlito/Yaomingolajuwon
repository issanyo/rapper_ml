[Verse 1: Starlito]
I been sipping lean all day (all day)
Barely even stand up straight (Lito)
(Lito) Got this big bank roll
Hell no it won't fold, so it gotta stand up straight (Longway)
Run it up and re-locate, Yea
Might like a picture of your hoe page (I might)
(Damn) Put her on a jet, man this hoe a mess
Come to find out she got no home training (hahaha)
My people speak another language
I got the plug and my lil' brother slangin' Shhh (Grind hard)
Hit the cup then I get hunger pains
If I don't get this money I got no one to blame (Ahh)
Know how to get it at least a hundred ways (Hunnid)
And I don't keep up with the number J's (I don't)
But I used to keep my re-up in a patent leather black, and I'm strapped like the number 8's (bahh)
Bad Bitch and she won't behave (hoe)
Made eye contact from on the stage (hey)
Even though I sip this drink, waiting on me to go to sleep, put me on the page, No Way (No Way) Haha (haha)
Slippers kind of told that, hit me when it hit the count
Flipped up on a bigger house
I fly em in and kick em out
I'm grinding, different route, my lyrics I really live 'em out
I'm serious like when Tip came out

I want to quit but I can't decide
Damn near got enough to retire (yea)
Still will pull up and serve a nigga 3-5 (Trash Bag Gang)
Used to post up by the street sign (East Side)
I hope I never press rewind (ahh)
If so, keep some minutes on my phone
(Get it) Get it gone, Ima be fine (yeah)
If you owe me then I need mine (3x)
I meant that shit I had to say it 3 times
