[Intro: Starlito]
Tires gotta b m rated ridin Michelin latitude
Spray the mac like its black magic all black, nigga witta attitude
Wrist watch fulla ice cube
Ziploc fulla rabbit food
Rubber gloves straight dog food like the pet store we gettin off to
Like the vet hoe getcha dog shot
U da type of nigga call the cops if im shooting dice then i brought my Glock
Seen em lose they life n it taught me alot
Got a young freak with a tongue ring make it disappear with a cough drop
I was so geeked first shot a nigga when my pistol cock i heard my jaws lock
Niggas talkin like they robocop gotta know i keep something tucked
And my youngins so in da cut with a drum and they dont do nothing but clutch
Im in first place u the runner up
You just run ya mouth i just run it up
I just want the mouth u just wanna fuck
I just fucked another couple hundred up

[Verse 1: MobSquad Nard]

Bank teller smell da loud n smile She kno I'm up n runnin Get money facts
Nigga watch da way u lookin at me
Snap Sosa in da Range Rover
Black magic in da choppa
Split a bitch in half I'm finna take da game over
Dub for dub ill sell a bitch a whole key and it might take a hunnid days

[Verse 2: MobSquad Nard]
Mind control over any nigga plottin on me like to call it black magic

Hated on me to his hoe she seen me in da VIP n had a back spasm
Make it wetter den da ocean foe a nigga poke her kno I gotta white rag it
Trippin on me cuz I went to puttin on da rubber like I'm actin nice nasty
Not a rapist I'll white flag it
Pull a condom off n Mike jack it
Got mo zippers den a Mike jacket
Moon rock same color light cabbage
Whole city fulla gun smoke you swimming in da water wit a life jacket
Real recognize real I don't know u niggas from a can of black magic
Rich cougar outta Cali only why I'm fuckin wit her she a slight ratchet
We don't run off on da plug cuh buddy too many units we just right back it
Shit don't get to addin up da snipers go to gettin to it we dislike static
In a black caddy by da mike shad Itz 2 choppas in da bitch I'm black flaggin
Den go pull up by da river where we throw da pistols after dat I'm back trappin
I'm da pick of many litters bitches wanna fuck on Nardo like a jack rabbit
Soon as bitches go to trippin i be disappearing poof call it black magic

[Chorus/Outro] x 2
Dats black magic dats black magic double down it make black magic
Mask on creep silent 44 its muzzled down it make black magic
Plug'll drop it to my sister house 90 wit me call it makmatics
Pop it off before i drop it off it disappeared on me dats black magic
