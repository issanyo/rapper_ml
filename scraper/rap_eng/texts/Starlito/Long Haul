[Hook: Kevin Gates]
In this for the long haul
Til death should do us part
Through thick and thin I won't pretend
We In this for the long haul
Loyalty's something naturally instilled
We're in this for the long haul
Teacher said you can't develop doubt for my niggas
Alone at night, pray to god that I can count on my niggas
While they're right round in prison accepting phone calls
Miles away, hard to smile some days
We In this for the long haul

[Verse 1: Alley Boy]
You know I'm ridin' til the wheels fall
My nigga, I'm in it for the long haul
Fuck all the money and fame
These niggas changed
Man these haters. shit, the streets ain't the same
I pray to God
I hope he see the pure in my heart
Clutchin' my pistol, paranoid as I pull in my garage
These niggas' changin'. camouflage, I can read through the lines
I'm living blind, I can't see it but I feel it inside
These niggas changing on the daily, I can see it in they faces
Me and my mob, we forever, why these fake trade places
Nigga said he in it for the long haul
Then get in front of the judge and tell it all
The Lord see it all

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
In this for the long haul
Til death should do us part
Through thick and thin I won't pretend
We In this for the long haul
Loyalty's something naturally instilled
We're in this for the long haul
Teacher said you can't develop doubt for my niggas
Alone at night, pray to god that I can count on my niggas
While they're right round in prison accepting phone calls
Miles away, hard to smile some days
We In this for the long haul


[Verse 2: Starlito]
Between the grief and lack of sleep
It's become painful to hold my eyes open
High and focused
Trying to ignore some shit
You probably obviously noticed
See most of my homies got that work
But they didn't apply for it. Resume sided
I'll catch a body or die for it
This my story, you guys boring
I just fly the chorus
How i'm supposed to grind
Them niggas on my side of town Waring
Get found down without warning
We out here on it
Green dot cards
My nigga died for about a thousand on it
Heard the gang unit, why em always gotta file on us
Tell my niggas lean on me if you catch a little stretched out on it
Countin on me, I'll be countin down til you touch down
Yeah you down but never out, you held it down. forever proud. Lito!

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
In this for the long haul
Til death should do us part
Through thick and thin I won't pretend
We In this for the long haul
Loyalty's something naturally instilled
We're in this for the long haul
Teacher said you can't develop doubt for my niggas
Alone at night, pray to god that I can count on my niggas
While they're right round in prison accepting phone calls
Miles away, hard to smile some days
We In this for the long haul
