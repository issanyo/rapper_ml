[Intro:]
Two of my favorite rappers one of them said “ I don’t get tired”
The other one said “you ain’t grinding til you tired” I said I’m tired

[Hook:]
I’m tired of struggling f*cking the profit up like I’m grinding for nothing
F*ck it I can’t give up
I’m a die from hustling trust me that bike I took
I’m alive because of it

[Verse 1:]
Crushed ice all in my watch and my cup
I come from watching for cops on the block with a tuck
Socks stuck how many times them n*ggas shot at us
Sh*t not enough prolly why I never got high as buck but I couldn’t give a f*ck
Bullet holes all in through the headrest like I wasn’t in that truck
On that pac with my two Glocks like I won’t hit em up
People I was close to now I don’t hear from much
Cause everybody want to know am I gonna get my cut
What the f*ck why how hold it in
Til you crying out loud for crying out loud
Hold up I trying to smile how about now sh*t
Looking out I’m down about now hundred thou

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah you lying but f*ck it smoking they plus they minus
Grinding the subject that’s cause I smoke too much
Sometimes I be clubbing hustling backwards boy purp
Got me paranoid luck f*cked up from fort and on her
I know I don’t care for her there for her I’m moving forward
TSA keep staring I be up in the airport supernova
Hell yeah I’m self-employed with 10 bands and some hooping shorts
Ask me who I do it for Reba out her lets do some roids
Used to go so hard to blow it all in the Gucci store
Or fixing up a car just to impress all these stupid whores
Shooting dice to win a little bit end up losing a little more

[Hook]
