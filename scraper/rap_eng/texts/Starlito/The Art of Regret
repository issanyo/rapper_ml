[Verse 1: Starlito]
An old soul rockin' a throwback jersey
I sent her roses on Thursday
We back beefin' before they burgundy
Words are weapons
Sometimes even when you say nothin', it's still mass destruction
She wasn't with me for my status, or my cash, or nothing
Gone, our separate ways; I think about her some days
Most of all, I think I'm thankful that I'm out of her way
Maybe meditate, I doubt that I pray
Might count it, but don't save
It gets so tense, I often feel my sense of humor fade
No suspense, but I guess that's the true expense of what you've obtained
The pretense of fame, means you pretend you're not insane
They sendin' all these shots without sendin' a name
When I send shots, I send you in and out your lane
Spinnin' out..
I'm pullin' up on anythang, mention Jermaine
Respect my come up, I defied gravity
Rhyme by myself, I arrive rapidly
Smokin' by myself, nah, I ain't passin' it
Do anything to provide for my family
What I'mma front for?
My life on the line on the grind every time I walk out my front door
Could have ninety-nine mill, I'm still gon' want more
Like, what's one more?
In the streets nobody plan to go to jail
A lot of soldiers get knocked on the humble
Rap like I'm on the run, I did what I done
Ain't the least bit ashamed, not proud neither
Cause if I got caught, all the shit I saw
Probably be locked up and get out neither
Just been runnin' red lights, in my red car, with the red seats
Shipped it out to AZ
Grind hard, I fed me
Yeah, that's my legacy
Learn from your mistakes, exterminate the fakes
Don't let nothin' deter ya; that's determination
The side of the town I come from, you rarely, if ever, make it
Nobody I know patient
And when it's slow, they start takin'
My homies incarcerated, they say I'm they motivation
Hustlers and boosters embrace me for the music I be makin'
Gang units falsely accuse me of some type of affiliation
But I fell in love with guns
It's the only way I knew to deal with the hatred
