You gon' really like this one

Started with a friend request, ended in stress
We met while I was in route, pencil and test
In hands with scantrons, I was walking in class
Her smile said I was handsome, but she was talking too fast
I was reading her body language, should've had a translator
She was on that lil girl shit, want a grown man to chase her
Nah, no thank ya, I'll do us both the favor
The pursuit wasn't in vain, but it feels like a mistake, uh
Six months, nothing to show for it
I'm Doug E Fresh, six minutes I'm so over it
Birthday sex would've been the best if you were sober
It was just fine, you were under my arm, like deodorant
I ain't tripping, that chapter so over with
You almost took me backwards, but instead, I will grow from this
Next shallow girl that I meet, I will notice it
And I won't get her number on the way to class, hopefully
Silly rumors, really humorous
You can thank everybody that knows, cause they did it to us
Cause I ain't said or did nothing, but would get into it
Now I damn near wish I didn't do it, it's getting to me
