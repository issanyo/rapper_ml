[Verse 1]
I can work with that
Smokin' on that killer shit
Fruity pebble, purple pack
You know we on some killer shit
My homie just beat a murder rap
You don't know who you dealin' with
Don't pay me, you gettin' murked for that
Two straps, like Urkel, shoot ya
Then say, damn, did I do that?
Difference between me & you, rich homie
Boy, the shit you talkin' bout, I do that

[Bridge]
Too real for this rap shit..
Too real for this rap shit..

[Verse 2]
I figured it out
I'm a high risk & a flight risk
They fear you when you're living it out
Been a long time since an artist was really about
What they spit out they mouth
Yeah, niggas say they gettin' money
But it look like they sleep on the couch
Get you a house, gettin' new paper
Might just get me a route
Came a long way from making the newspaper
'Bout some shoot-outs

[Pre-Chorus]
Everytime I go out
You know I bring that tool out
Need to quit bullshittin'
Cold Turkey, nigga, cool out
Need to quit bullshittin'
Cold Turkey, nigga, cool out
I said, you need to quit bullshittin'
Cold Turkey, cool out

[Chorus]
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see what that gets you
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where that gets you
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where that gets you
Too many pictures on too many shirts
Now I get the picture

[Verse 3]
Can't nobody tell you shit, you know it all
But when you go and get fucked off, who you gon' call?
I recall, callin' my folks collect
Mama cryin', you know the rest
Never heard her so upset
I made mistakes, so you wouldn't have to make 'em
This advice comes with experience
You ain't got to take it
Call your granny, check on her
See how her day went
When I lose mine, I'mma lose my mind
Where would I be without that lady?
Streets crazy, I drive these hoes lazy
Knowing good and well I ain't got time for five ol' ladies
I come from nothing, my nigga
I'm just trying to motivate ya
You can't take nothing for granted
I'm grinding, no vacation

[Verse 4]
Ain't tryna fuck up my focus
So I been sober lately
Everytime I pull out my garage
I been gettin' pulled over lately
Investigations and accusations from open cases
Detectives nosey & racist, they get my poker face
(Fuck 'em)
Smoking 'til I'm sedated to hide my frustation
Shawty studying to be a nurse
I wonder if I'll ever have patience
Can't get comfortable with this cake
No, I'm never complacent
I'm grateful that the lord give it
But I know he can take it

[Chorus]
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where it gets you
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where it gets you
Keep doing that shit you doing
And see where it gets you
Too many pictures on too many shirts
Now I get the picture

[Outro]
If you out here bullshitting, quit it
