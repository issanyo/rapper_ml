[Verse 1: Starlito]
(Insomnia Addict)
What you say the name of this was?
Free my nigga; Sunday I'm going to see my nigga, just because
I decided to drop a mixtape, just because
I can't sleep, and they sleepin' on me; all of the above
(I said it must be the drugs..)
Must be, maybe so; maybe the 'dro been making me crazy, though
I been here since twelve-fifteen, eight-four, and went crazy the day before
This was just my day-to-day, what other way would you know?
Fish just went to grab the sushi, sent my bitch to MoneyGram
Inchin' up on another hundred grand, motherfuck Uncle Sam
No incest, but, from here on out I'm only fuckin' with family
Since you here, just hear me out; I won't listen to nothin' you sayin' to me
I turn in my album Monday, the government shut down last night
To hell with welfare and healthcare; what up with the gas price?
They sold us a dream; soda, water, just add the ice
I like my syrup with a splash of Sprite, sip until I'm up half the night
(I said it must be the drugs..)
They want fifty for a line, I just been on my grind
Gotta admit, some shit been on my mind
Crooked, corrupt coppers been comittin' all the crime
They should free all of the real niggas; give the snitches all the time

Hey, hey let me hit that before you put it out!

[Verse 2: Starlito]
No, I won't put no molly in her drink, nor a dollar in her bank
I wanna quit fuckin' with these nothin' assholes, the problem is I can't
Lately I've been gettin' followed, that's what I think
I thank the Lord that He woke me up today, I don't remember layin' down
Playin' a game where it ain't no rules, I'm just tryin' to stay in-bounds
I'm a hundred-eighty pounds with the weight of the world on my shoulders
I been to hell and back, but that just made me so much colder
What do you know, I'm focused; though I'm nowhere near sober
What do you know about lookin' over your shoulder while cookin O's?

(I said it must be the drugs..)
(I said it must be the drugs..) And it must be the drugs..
(I said it must be the drugs..)
(I said it must be the drugs..) And it must be the drugs..

[Verse 3: Starlito]
That don't make it cool, nah that don't make it cool
I rap like this cause it happened; I ain't ask to make the news
Sip a little syrup, that'll make you rude, aggravated too
And if you can get a good night of sleep, congratulations to you
(I said it must be the drugs..) Lucky you..
