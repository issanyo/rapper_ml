Lito
It's 11:57pm i'm in New York, gotta be in Jacksonville, Florida in the morning

[Verse]
She blinded by the city lights, grinding tryna get it right
Wide awake, late at night catching bites, waiting on arriving flights
She fuck me like she love me call me like she need me, lie like i believe her..
But i know she deceitful i know if i get locked up or if i fall off she gone leave me (she gone leave me.. simple as that)
My og told me theyll ride the wave til its high tide
Wait til the water runs dry then its bye bye
By the way i wrote this out of state aye whats the wifi
My phone ain't gettin no service still waiting on reimbursement
She facetime me repeatedly i'm like baby you see i'm working (damn)
I'm hitting the road on friday look come stay with me on thursday
She said that he been hatin on me and basically ian tryna hear dat shit
Broke people talk about people and ion want no broke bitch
My side piece been on that bullshit my lil freak might get promoted
I can't sleep and i get lonely but i won't beef about her homie, i got too many..
