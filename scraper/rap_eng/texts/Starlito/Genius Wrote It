[Verse 1 -Tha City Paper]
I pulled up, take the block
Then I said I appreciate ya
Nowadays it’s just boss shit
Motivator, mediator
Got to watch out for them alphabet boys, abbreviators
Quarter chickens, four and a baby
Used to keep that bitch in an incubator
Small town, perfect timing
Pulled up bumping that Big Lou
Hoop dreams, junior college, goddamn I wish I was 6’2”
Hold up, hold up, remember me?
Motherfucking right, I remember nights
[?] on the project floor
I didn’t even give a fuck, didn’t dim the lights
Old shit, but she heavy now, got a nigga telling them cock tales
Meeting up with young T Hyde, I ain’t s’posed to be eating these ox tails
Enterprise, need to rent a car, young bitch ain’t got a credit card
Son still getting his hustle on, shooting threes to  [?] better yard
I’m City Paper, I’m a rap god
All I can say is a genius wrote it
Half a plug, I ain’t even tripping, guess I’ll let Ms. Tina hold it
Blood money, see the stars, where the hell is Ms. Mother Nature?
Tryna get like them Arabs, 50 stores, 100 acres

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Starlito]
I just caught a pound play out the Uber
They watching how I maneuver
Had to tell all my shooters stay off the computer
Had a bad looking bitch out at Hooters
And a broke hood bitch even cuter
Give me brain, she the tutor, I’m the student
End up fucking all the hoes I went to school with
She stupid, now I’m a genius, acting like they forgot the facts
I shot my strap, was balling for about two hours ‘fore he got snapped
Free my homies, this for the projects and the college cats
Gave away scholarships from my lil partners, passing out the stacks
Cool ass nigga, still Cashville’s hottest act
Just copped a spot in AZ and in Vegas, he must got a sec
I holler grind hard, and I mean it
Why you sound like that? Cause I’m leaning
On it, sincerely yours, a genius wrote it

[Hook]
Said a genius wrote it

[Verse 3 – Petty]
Hey, let me get it then
Fuck rap, jump back, be the [?]
Getting paid, switch blade, cut that like a middleman
Pull up all black in a minivan
Imma kill em when it’s cold out
Leave a nigga with his soul out
Then I roll out, fuck it, say a genius wrote it
Ain’t no [?], uh uh, they don’t know about nothing
Young Aristotle, I’mma a [?] starter
Check, I go hella harder
You can tell apart a motherfucker like me easy
Got a Socrates like philosophy
Prophesize every prophecy that my prophets see
Wonder what’ll make em start with me
I know that it’s hard to be, got a flow that can part the seas
My heart disease, bitch
Better check the signs, you don’t wanna be the next to die
It affects the time, so a nigga gon respect my mind
Petty Cain, I’m a rap god
Ride a beat, say a genius wrote it
Real niggas, real bitches love it
When I kick the bucket, RIP Bironas
This that shit that gon last forever
No dream, I know it, say a genius wrote it
King decoded, never let a ho between the focus
Said a genius wrote it
Do my dirt alone, I don’t want a nigga singing on me
Say a genius wrote it
And if you ain’t want it when I read up homie
Then I seen [?], said a genius wrote it
