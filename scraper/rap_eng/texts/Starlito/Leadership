[intro-Starlito]
Bruh I'm in the booth bruh, Hello
It ain't all bad, but it ain't all good neither, Shit
Yeah
[Verse 1-Starlito]
I'm in the lab drinking coffee, (drinking coffee)
Devil all on me trying to get him off me. (get em off me) Yeah
Felony charge got to get it off me
Tomorrow I'm walking in my lawyer office I'ma let my money do the talking
Trying to quit smoking, but now I'm nauseous, cautious from all my losses
Distant, they got to be close to cross you, all of these labels keep sending offers. (sending offers)
Might just sign one, and the run off, I don't need they money I'm bossed up (bossed up)
Still got them on stand-by could call the plug
But what's gon' happen to my family if I get caught up still on that same shit that I always was I can't sleep 'till they all wake up
(It's Lito)

[Chorus-Starlito]
Late night, I'm high as fuck, I'm seeing shit
I'm riding low just me and shit
This for my niggas that's grinding up the sea of bread
You can't be greedy, but when you got enough you to quit
Who else gon' tell you this
They call this leadership

[Verse 2-Starlito]
I'm on my grind, out my mind
The blind leading the blind
I told lil' mama I love you
She told me hold it down
Then I told her I'd be home early, but she know that I'm lying
Barely stop at stop signs, I'm on the go for mine
Pouring up folks from coast to coast, yeah slow motion some time
Living fast, Paying for an abortion, I don't know if it's mine
Smoked a quarter back to back, I'm like Romo with that nine, and it shoot thirty times like Kobe Bryant
Still ballin' though I'm close to retiring, I recorded this to be snorted, yeah that's a dope line
La Cosa Nostra motor I don't slow up for the sierns, take a moment decide if I'm pulling over this time

[Chorus-Starlito]
I'm high as fuck, I'm seeing shit
I'm riding low just me and shit
This for my niggas that's grinding up the sea of bread
You can't be greedy, but when you got enough you need to quit
Who else gon' tell you this, They call it leadership
