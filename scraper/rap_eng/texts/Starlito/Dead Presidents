[Verse 1: Don Trip]
I woke up this morning
I looked in the mirror and told me I'm proud of myself
I took a chance and I went left and made it without any help
But that ain't to say I ain't had obstacles in my way
They tried to stop me along the way
But I had the rocket right there on my waist
Life is a challenge can't have it your way
What am I hoping for? Though I don't pray
Hoping for, less funerals and no more court dates
Oh boy I'm late, living my dreams out wide awake
Now to this day
I got some memories I can't erase
Life is a test can't afford to retake

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
Dead prezzies baby
Why you living in a lie like the levees breaking
Silly you, you still waiting on reparation
I'm on my grind daily bring home the bread and bacon
Patience, be my guest by all means try and interfere
I'll take a piece of silverware and cut your face from ear to ear
It ain't nothin' all my cards facin'
In case you think I'm bluffin'
I just wrote out my expenses I got bullets in the budget
That's the cost of doing business i guess
What the fuck is your agenda if it isn't a check?
I'm declaring war we not on the same accord, anymore
I will sweep your block like its a simple chore
Fuck you and I mean it
You know how I'm rockin'
Skeletons in my yard, choppers in the closet
Paranoia's taking control
I look my kids to the movies
You spent your day at the polls
I'm watching the fairy tale
You live in the fairy tale
Fuck your president no matter who's elected I don't care
Fuck it, carry on, we living in hell but it's a happy home
I'm just making sure my babies eat when daddy's gone
Godspeed

I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me

[Verse 3: Starlito]
Last night I had a dream that the president died
Woke up he was still alive I felt like crying, damn
Changed the channel and seen something about a travel ban
What the fuck man, every Muslim ain't the Taliban
I don't wanna go to war with all the Mexicans
Got everybody on ten like Thomas Jefferson
From apprentice to corporate menace
America played their trump card
I speak for the disenfranchised furniture in their front yard
The tax increase got me jacking these beats
Damn near back in the streets
When I was happy to leave
Step brothers 4 no more than nine months after the 3
Dot told me "You can't quit, Slim, you rapping for me."
Ride and bumping that old Gotti
And I'm smoking gelato
Well known in East Oakland
I got folks in Chicago
Prolly sold some pounds of dro
To the nigga that opened up my show
I was way to busy trapping when Diddy told me to die or vote
Then I caught a pistol charge with that .40 in my coat
Realest nigga recording I knew that in '05 though
My only regret from Cash Money Records I nearly died broke
But that would have been my fault, anyway anyhow
I figured it out I'm getting it now
Real niggas in style, residuals pilling
Keep digital scales and I still move in silence
Word to Chris Tuck I hope they kill that motherfucker
Dead Presidents
