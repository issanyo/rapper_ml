[Verse 1: Starlito]
Last seen ridin' clean with some dealer plates
Fuckin' up this rap money on lean, guns and real estate
Just got a Rolex watch, I had to take a link up out it
Take a drink, I'm drowsy
How much paper you think I'm countin'?
I just split a pound four ways to make a single thousand
My little round'll shoot you in the face...
Got a Rolex watch, I had to take a link up out it
Take a drink, I'm drowsy
How much paper you think I'm countin'?
I just split a pound four ways to make a single thousand
My little round'll shoot you in the face and he ain't gon' think about it, whoa
I'm tryin' to stop the violence
I'm buyin' a Glock with a silence
You cheap and your vehicle's leased, you tryin' to watch the mileage
I'm countin' this fettucine, thinkin' "why was I in college?"
A lot of niggas dissed me that I'll probably not acknowledge
We got homicidal hobbies
Got no problem catchin' bodies
I keep riders all around me
They just wanna see me prosper
All my shows like choir rehearsal, I'm here to preach the gospel
All my hoes be lyin', they worsesome
All I know is grind, keep workin'

[Hook: Starlito]
If you ain't get no check, then I ain't checkin' for ya
Want this around my neck, I got that FN for ya
If you ain't gettin' no money, she won't answer for ya
Won't pay these hoes no mind, too busy payin' my mortgage
And these lawyers
Payin'[???]
[???]

Used to stand on corners, hand to hand with quarters
Now we get it transported

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Stash box in my whip, that bitch a transformer
And I'm important, so my people import it
Yeah, my last show, I fucked around, got ten for it
And according to my calender, got ten more
Play with me, you don't know what you in for
Still a pull up in the 'hood like what you hidden for
Pull out, catch my plug, he waitin' at the liquor store
Cried a thug tear yesterday, yeah, cause they picked up Roy
Damn, I got 20 mouths to feed, plenty people countin' on me
I'm grouchy once I down the lean
I smoked a quarter pound this week
I'm movin' weight, still out of shape
My newest place is out of state
All these hoes, they out of pocket
All these suckers gotta pay
Been down that road before, so I know goin' broke is not OK
I done pulled up out at eight, noddin' but I'm wide awake
I'll put her on a plane, and I'll put her out for playin'
Hell nah, I'm not gon' change, even though I got some change

[Hook: Starlito]
If you ain't get no check, then I ain't checkin' for ya
Want this around my neck, I got that [?] for ya
If you ain't gettin' no money, she won't answer for ya
Won't pay these hoes no mind, too busy payin' my mortgage
And these lawyers
Payin'[???]
