[Verse 1: Starlito]
It was my motherfucking nigga
At least I thought it was
Dogwas a blood
The way he flipped
You thought I called him cuz
I peeped across him
And it got awkward
Once they caught the plug
We all thugs
You take a loss is when you boss up
Nigga fuck you mean
Dump shit
Yea I’m all for it
Hard in the paint
Take it outside
Like a small forward
Bout that action
And my real niggas all know it
Just a distraction
I’ll be stupid if I fall for it
Got a hunnit pussy niggas
Trying to take my spot
I'm the coach, I’m the player and the mascot (my team winning)
Take one for granted cause came up with the have nots
I’m on that pot
When you see me bitch grab you Glock
Take your best shot
Cause it’ll be your last shot
Fuck shooting it out
I’m trying to dome something
And smash out
It was hard to see the snakes
Cause the grass high
Still a spazz
But I’m just focused on the cash right now (Fuck that shit)

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Big homie used to take care of me
There for me
Now when I see him
It be seeming like he scared of me
Apparently he might be afraid of himself
Faced with saving himself or taking that L
Lose Lose
You live, you lust or lookout when it due
It’s easy saying what you wouldn’t
Until it’s you
I keep waking up out of this nightmare
But then it’s true
I’m tryna get up out these streets
Don’t get this shit confused
When they came to dude
I’ll get at you
That sell  same loyalty get me ridiculed
Guilty by association
It’s like I did too
My life real
I write what I feel (Black Sheep Don’t Grin)

[Outro: Robin Raynelle]
It seems nothing stays the same
People change
I know
I guess it’s just the way it goes
