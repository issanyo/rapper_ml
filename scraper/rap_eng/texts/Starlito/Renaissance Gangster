Nothing to do with using, but I got a drug habit
Yeah I just flipped two birds, like Bud Adams
Titanic shit, I got a constant flow
28s going fast, Chris Johnson O's
Got my heat every morning, Alonzo's
Cause I put them babies in the streets, I'm irresponsible
No children though, Just two in the queue
???, white girl, yeah, Suzy Q
Introduce myself as if I'm new to school
LitoGuapAlotIGet, that's right, I usually do
Everybody talking bricks, I done moved a few
All these impersonators, I can't tell who is who
I know one thing, you ain't me
Never was that dude and you can't be
I been this way for a long time
Try the kid, nu uh, wrong place, wrong time

Renaissance Gangster, Renaissance Gangster
I done made a living out here pissing off haters
Renaissance Gangster, Renaissance Gangster
Strapped like I'm into it with the Al Qaeda

Renaissance Gangster, You old niggas got some bitch ways
You're probably going through menopause, Ain't ya
Hatin' ain't healthy, but nigga I thank ya
Death to all my enemies, that's something that'll drink too
Toast to crime, and to Grind Hard
Trash bag in the trunk of her car
Don't nothing move if you don't run it by Star
Even though there's another hundred that's coming by tomorrow
I just hung up on this dummy, said he wanted nine hard
He don't understand, that's another kind of charge
I'm aware of you Mini Me mother fuckers trying hard
To be Starlito, but I'm not Dr. Evil
I don't need your mojo, as long as I got amigo
Getting rid of the weight like Fat Bastard serving all these people
Got rid of my desert eagle, got me something lighter
You love her, but you fight her, and my money just excites her

I done made a living out here pissing off haters
