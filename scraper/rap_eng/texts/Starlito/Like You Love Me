Nothing's better than a side boob...

Ch-Check!

She fuck me like she love me
She treat me like she don't ...

[Intro]
She fuck me like she love me
Then treat me like she don't need me (she don't need me)
She fuck me like she love me
Then treat me like she don't need me (she don't need me)
I'm just tryna get even
Fuck me like she love me
Then treat me like she don't need me (she don't need me)
Aaaa, la, la

[Verse 1]
She fuck me like she love me
Then treat me like she don't need me (uh)
Look me in my eye and deceive me
Lie for no reason (uh)
Foolish, It's my pride
I don't know why I believe her
Cause she tell me that it's mine
When I'm hitting it from behind
Every time, every time!
She be like "It's all yours!"
Really thick in Michael Kors
But see me, I like Victoria's
I'm the type to drop a line like
Can you keep a secret? (Can you?)
Can you keep it wet? If so, then I'm diving in the deep end
On the way O.T
I might just fly you in this weekend
And I'm not tryna play no games
Nah, I'm not tryna play no games
You might as well not wear no panties
I'm the type to tear 'em off
It ain't tricking if you enjoying yourself
And personally, I don't care what it costs
Just...

[Hook]
Fuck me like you love me
And treat me like you don't need me
When we're out in public
Act like you don't see me
Yeah, This here our little secret
As long as you can keep it
100, I'ma keep it 1000
I got it if you need it
But can I get some head? Can I, can I get some head?
Can I? Can I? ...
You'll never guess what she said!
Can I get some bread? Can I, can I get some bread?
Can I? Can I? ...
I was like hell yeah

[Verse 2]
Paying for the meal if the head game right
Paying for the room, not staying for the night
She got a man aight, but he ain't laying it right
(Ahhhhhhh)
She be like stop, that means keep going
Have her tweaking in the coop like Smokey
Call her Felisha how I Deebo it
Beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
Beat it up, have her calling into work late
Fuck around get fired on her off day
Put that ass to sleep, might need a cup of coffee
Have you where you can't even walk straight
Just bite the pillow, don't talk bae (Shut up!)
Text him back, you hyperventilating
Just cut that phone off, Tell him you lost your charger
Deal with that shit tomorrow
First rule in business: Keep'em out your business
We're just creeping, freaking
I'ma kill that pussy, we don't need no witness (nope)
My last bitch just wanted the fame (just wanted the fame)
She don't get it, we don't need commitment
We just need each other for 30 minutes

[Hook]
Just fuck me like you love me
And treat me like you don't need me
When we're out in public
Act like you don't see me
Yeah, This is our little secret
As long as you can keep it
100, I'ma keep it 1000
I got it if you need it
But can I get some head? Can I, can I get some head?
Can I? Can I? ...
You'll never guess what she said
Can I get some bread? Can I, can I get some bread?
Can I? Can I? ...
You ain't gotta beg
I was like hell yeah

[Outro]
