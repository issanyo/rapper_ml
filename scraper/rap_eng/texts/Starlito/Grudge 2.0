[Intro]
I owe you one, that's fair enough, I know you
Ahh, ahh, yeah

[Chorus]
You've been down for me since way before I ran it up
I was running them streets trying to slam dunk
And what I mean, no laying up
I owe you one, that's fair enough
I know you sent them prayers up, thank you
And I'm sorry, something I can't say enough
Can't make up for the way it was, I wake up still holding a grudge
Really mad at myself for when I didn't show you more love
All we got is right now to make it right
Get right, we gotta keep it right
All we got is right now to make it right
Get right, we gotta keep it right

[Verse 1]
I can't sleep, this how I be some nights
Rolled the leaf and I need a light
Load a beat and I speak on life
Rolled the streets, seen police lights
So I went home, looked in the mirror and I didn't know him
All of my habits expensive, especially like having like ten hoes
It's been a minute, man I've been gone, she ain't heard from me
Told me call her when I touched down like Joe Horn in the endzone, but I didn't though
I was probably with a nympho, and I barely even got her info
Pulled up in a Benzo, overqualified for the friendzone
Phone blowing u, and I'm getting blown
Need to grow up from the shit I'm on
If I tell the ho I don't need her, first day I meet her, then did I lead her on?
I don't like my ex, had to leave her 'lone
I don't like to text, you might read it wrong
So I wrote a message and made a song
'Cause I had you stressing for way too long
I'm sorry

[Chorus]
You've been down for me since way before I ran it up
I was running them streets trying to slam dunk
And what I mean, no laying up
I owe you one, that's fair enough
I know you sent them prayers up, thank you
And I'm sorry, something I can't say enough
Can't make up for the way it was, I wake up still holding a grudge
Really mad at myself for when I didn't show you more love
All we got is right now to make it right
Get right, we gotta keep it right
All we got is right now to make it right
Get right, we gotta keep it right

[Verse 2]
Too many hoes in my call-log, refusing to fold or to fall off
Who would've known, I thought you was my homie
But you was my foe nigga all along
Move around, what's that old shit got to do with now?
Too much emotion when you speaking now, should be reaching out
Plus I heard that you've been talking down
Put some respect on my name nigga
Never let none of this change a nigga
You just got off your grind, like you lost your mind
Then you wanna blame a nigga
Don't remember nights from the days I was sipping
No I ain't ashamed, I can say that I was tripping
Pussy niggas hate but I don't pay them no attention
Now you ain't in the play 'cause you weren't playing your position

[Chorus]
You've been down for me since way before I ran it up
I ran it up and you switched up, but guess what, I don't give a fuck
I owe you one, that's fair enough
You played me close, betrayed my trust, thank you
And I'm sorry, something you can't say enough
Can't make up for the way it was, I wake up still holding a grudge
Really mad at myself because I showed you too much love
All we got is right now
Nah we can't make it right so don't speak, alright?
All we got is right now, shit
Keep lookin', nigga gon' squeeze on sight

[Outro]
Yeah, bitch
I owe you one, that's fair enough
