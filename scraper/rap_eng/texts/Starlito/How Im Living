[Chorus:]
This how I’m really living this how I’m living
They wanna lock me in that building n*ggas prolly want to kill
You will die if I slip that’s wise whip
One in the hole everywhere I go I ain’t trip (repeat)

[Verse 1:]
You ever seen a handgun chopper that’s a semi automatic
In the spot with a carbon in the kitchen by the baggies
Drop a quarter in the water made it harder for the addicts
Bought the etch ch ch ch
Stretch a n*gga on the trap
Lito that’s my people play with him and then it’s up up
My limit is they bag give the word then they pulling no dough
You meditate the murder game all b*tch n*ggas getting plush
The stick on put the bliss on y’all b*tch n*ggas getting rushed
Work the camera and I’ll get time all nighters in my b*tch ride
Kill it then alive on a server seven with 65
My coke will leave ya with the big eye
Tan leave em all slumped over
Got bars like give me yo b*tch n*gga
I’m f*cking goose she coming over
That’s how I’m living
Spitting til I’m infinite
Free all my n*ggas getting it
Made a killing out the kitchen
And I don’t care who there
Admit it come through there
My spot like a salon
Everybody done do her (n*gga f*ck your favorite dj)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Niggas in the courtroom with my name in their mouth
These n*ggas ain’t really about the sh*t they say they’re about
Now we ain’t running out my people straight in the drought
I short you better check it might not weigh that amount
Little Didi hit me up ain’t said they ain’t got out
They ain’t living like this I ain’t worried about them taking my style
Get them out the vacuum seal yeah break it right now
They said they ain’t diamond sealed going straight out of town
They say a n*gga rap like I’m still running a course
Since a young been scarred plus I can’t remember nothing about them bars
Lito would’ve done like he don’t come with a charge
Can’t do nothing but go hard gotta bear my arm for the mark

[Chorus]
