[Intro-Starlito]
Yeah, Trakksounds

[Hook]
Liquor store, casino, car wash all around the clock
That's a one stop shop out on our block
The stop sign don't make that right, cause the cops hot
That's all we know, it don't make that right

[Chorus-Starlito]
Liquor store, casino, car wash all around the clock
That's a one stop shop out on our block
The stop sign don't make that right, cause the cops hot
That's all we know, it  don't make that right

[Verse 1- Propain]
Brenda's got a baby, well Brenda's got 4 matter in fact
That little hoe is fast, right beside the cul-de-sac sold us flat
Fuckin kitchen fluming, and odor is crack
Judges hanging niggas everyday we done rolled attached
45 office waves like a souljia rag
He robbing, his big brother caught a case, doin four for that
School bragged about how he was cold, almost pro in fact
Well that shit was 20 years old, bitch get over that
Momma go to her shift again, daddy heard he had a baby
He went missing from me, and he need a kidney
She out her suckin dick for a 10, picture pose their ain't no sign that she here for the pin
Killa sent the ?, but this is on for the DM
Cross like A.I., big dreams so we could be him
Morning birds chirping, the wolves howling in the pm
Shit crazy, nothing changed, same thing when I see em at

[Chorus-Starlito]
Liquor store, casino, car wash all around the clock
That's a one stop shop out on our block
The stop sign don't make that right, cause the cops hot
That's all we know, don't make that right aye aye
Liquor store, casino, car wash all around the clock
That's a one stop shop out on our block
The stop sign don't make that right, cause the cops hot
That's all we know, don't make that right

[Verse 2-Landlord]
Don't end up in the lost and found (forreal)
I'm confused I feel lost and found  (forreal)
Niggas see me putting up bricks and think I'm not a shooter
I don't trust nothing, Shit I don't even ride in ubers
Heard a nigga say, I'm in the hood like a transmission seen and he turned to a bitch that's a transmission
Cops hot, don't make that right (Never)
And just cause you apologize don't make that right
Look, niggas braggin about being a convicted felon
Niggas yelling 'free my nigga' known that they nigga tellin
I ain't even want the benz, I got it just to get you jealous
Try to give a fuck about you, that ain't really fit my schedule
Call way, she say she want a 3 way, she won't them dick
And she want this stick, that's a relay
So fuck with me (fuck with me) if you my bros you can fuck with me
But if don't you make that wrong right, than you are stuck with me

[Chorus-Starlito]
Liquor store, casino, car wash all around the clock
That's a one stop shop out on our block
The stop sign don't make that right, cause the cops hot
That's all we know, don't make that right aye aye
Liquor store, casino, car wash all around the clock
That's a one stop shop out on our block
The stop sign don't make that right, cause the cops hot
That's all we know, don't make that right
Lito

[Verse 3-Starlito]
My big homie, he kept it gutta
Even though he was on, I was a young nigga
He come through and throw me his own
We ain't had bricks, runnin from the police for stones
Last time I seen he look shook, bout 4 in the morning
Talkin fye bout his homie to a hoe on the phone
Too much pride to apologize, even though he was wrong
Pistol in his lap, I'm like what going on he said 'nothing'
Then poured a 4 in the patron
I was playing poker at the boot leg till the sun rose
I learned a valuable lesson about money and hoes
Its the invite them on and cruise on my side of town
Everywhere I ride around feel like I'm out of bounds
Police killin niggas (damn) and, you don't feel a nigga
Strive for over a quarter million, and I still a nigga
So I pull up at the same spot to get my car wash
Play my number ticket
Get a fifth of remy, I holla

[Chorus-Starlito]
Liquor store, casino, car wash all around the clock
That's a one stop shop out on our block
The stop sign don't make that right, cause the cops hot
That's all we know, don't make that right aye aye
Liquor store, casino, car wash all around the clock
That's a one stop shop out on our block
The stop sign don't make that right, cause the cops hot
That's all we know, don't make that right
