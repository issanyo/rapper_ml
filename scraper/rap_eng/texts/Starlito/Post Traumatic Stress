Sunrise I'm wide awake
Sportscenter on repeat
When she wake up, I'm just gon' put her back to sleep
War-torn, this is insomnia at it's peak
She want my heart but it's probably out in the streets
Probably somewhere close to the promises I couldn't keep
Truth don't even hurt her cause she refuse to believe
To her, it's but a dream
To me, it's just some time in between
Heart in a pretzel and my mind in a sling
So bored, I just be buying different things
Flying to a different scene
Cause I grind hard, the fuck you mean?
I mean, in the meantime gotta mean time piece
And a dime piece, nine fine freaks that ain't worth two cents each

(Robin Raynelle)
Where you goin'? Where you been?
I don't care how much you spend
Cause I love you the most when you're humble
And you come back again

(Lito)
Last time we argued she said

(Both)
I hope you never rap again

(Lito)
I said me too and then she said

(Both)
Wait, what's happenin'?

(Robin Raynelle)
Wait, what's happenin'?

(Lito)
I said I don't know

[Trey Songz sings]
Was I doing wrong
Will I ever get it right for you?
No no

(Lito)
The phone ringed but I ain't moved
Screen said don't answer so she ain't say who
Is it or none of that
Just embrace me and said "What we got is unbreakable"
Then a text came through, it read "I'm pregnant and I hate you"
Exclamation point
Next text was some numbers, that's the day that it's due
I don't know if she saw it so I just played it cool
Next text was a picture
It was her exposed navel, prenatal

(Robin Raynelle)
I only wish that you could visualize
The way I see you through my eyes
But instead you choose
To act as if you have something to prove
You know that I'm the one who here til the end
I continue taking you back time and time again
I know I should have gone but my heart's right here with you (Right here with you)
Just me for you

(Lito)
She grabbed my phone and hit the wall
I'm glad I ducked
I wished that she didn't give a fuck
This ain't true, say it's just my love for you
Damn look what lust will do
Another life, another broken home or two
What good is a coupe when your riding all alone
And you bought it as a his and hers set
It wasn't just the sex
Damn man I just wish I ain't tell her that I love her yet
I need algebra to express, Y just another X
Y just another X
So now I'm higher than a fucking jet
Surprised cause I know I used a rubber yet
Here come another text
To my other phone that says
"I got yo lying stupid ass I'm done with this, have fun raising your fucking kid
Bitch"
