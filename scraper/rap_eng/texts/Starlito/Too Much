She pull up on me looking like a snack
I took her homie and you can't have her back

[Verse 1]
Lately I been thinking too much
Rolled up too much dope, I'm Prolly drinking too much
Told her that I loved her, what I mean is too much
Then again I heard there was no such thing as too much
Can't lie sometimes I feel like these demons too much
Still there's no such thing as too much green in the blunt
Ain't sip no lean in two months
Shawty give me a reason to lust
She pull up on me then I end up  wanting to eat her for lunch
Fucking wit me I prolly teach you some stuff
You know Ima thug and I don't easily trust
We went from creeping on the hush, now we just do us
And if her last nigga don't like it, Fuck em he can adjust

[Chorus]
Long as I keep it real, and you keep it real
Fuck how they feel, Fuck how they feel
I'm in this for you, we ain't doing this for them
How you feel about the whole world vs you and Slim
X2

Baby girl you worry too much
Really don't give a fuck about who worried bout us
They wasn't riding dirty with us
40 in your purse can't fit that 30 in ya clutch
Our first date was at the shooting range
And my lil gangsta yea she call me by my middle name
She keep it really real, ain't really with the games
Yea I caught feelings and I'm feeling like she feel the same
And my lil snack I got her back I flipped her taxes for some stacks real quick
Real friendship wit benefits should never have to ask for shit
Last nigga to drive her whip wouldn't even put gas in it
Bout to put you in that coup just so you can pass em in it

[Chorus]
