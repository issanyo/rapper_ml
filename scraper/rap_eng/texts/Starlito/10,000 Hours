[Verse 1: Starlito]
It's not about what you earn
You a product of what you learn
I got hot and made a few dollas
As far as I was concerned
I came up, I stayed the same
I ain't change up, well I adapted
Adopted lots of the practices
From back when I was trappin'
Aggressive with my hustle
Ain't restin' I work a double
A triple shift just to break even
See i come from the struggle
Sucka shit I ain't wit it
Won't say it if I don't mean it
I tell em I grind hard
They say I make it look easy
They play my shit , they believe it
Been at tha shit since a teen
On my twenty-ninth birthday
They played my shit on t.v
Yea, signed a deal before I turned twenty
Been a minute, but the fact that i'm still in this shit mean i'm winnin

[Verse 2: Starlito]
It's not about what you earn
You a product of what you learn
For my spot I almost got shot up
Dem shots off got returned
Was it worth it, not really
Just barely ducked a conviction
I'm scared to fuck with prescriptions
They thuggin' for recognition
Kill ya to say they did it
They said i'd be a statistic
Dead or up in tha system
Federali still listenin'
I'm tip toein', gettin' loaded
Sippin', pourin', you know it
Introverted, in an out tha city I get tha lowest
Pictures you postin'
I wouldn't that shit I don't be on
I don't be playin
Gotta hop on a plane to follow me home
Gotta be a hata if my dollas botha you homes
I mean how could you have a problem
I got this here on my own
It's not about what you earned
Its not about what you got
But how long you can stay out
And try not to get shot
Real rap it's a drought
I'm Pimp C mixed with Pac
My ears ringin' non stop
From emptyin' my Glock
Mutha Fucka
