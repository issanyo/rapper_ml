[Verse 1 - Starlito]
Got me going through a thing, bout to go insane
This ho I’m with think I don’t know she only want my change
She only see my past, even though a nigga changed
She only see my cash, so I won’t give her anything
So frequently we clash, she speak her mind then give me brains
Sweetheart mouth, she’ll eat your heart out if you let her, I discontinued the strain
Our situation is strange, I call it growing pains
Cause I really loved her but know I ain’t really showed it man
Soon as you grow up you know there’s some nights that you’ll only be the coldest
I’m tired of playing house and sleeping over, we only getting older
These hoes be taking they toll, hope you ain’t notice this boulder on my shoulder
My guilty conscience doing life with no parole cause I ain’t shit
I already know, my heart’s so cold
Thought about throwing it, I suppose, but how though?
The block was hot, we used to heat the house with the stove
These are thoughts that I have when I’m out on the road
The money come fast so I count it slow

[Hook – Starlito][x2]
Ain’t no love in this shit, get the money, fuck the fame
That shit lame, it don’t exist
You already know how this shit go
Get shit jumping and watch how quick they get to switching like 64
You already know

[Verse 2 – Scotty ATL]
GPS on dollar sign, and the map say we ain’t far away
Underground with a hoop dream and a crossover like Hardaway
Couple niggas I thought were 100 and 1, we parted ways
Shining hard on these fuck niggas can’t throw no shade
No love and I learned that like real quick, hawk a loogie, this real spit
Pimping niggas bought you a fit, you might be rolling with a real bitch
I lower my brim low, see me riding with the same niggas like every time in every city
Cause family matters, no Winslow
Inbox me on Facebook, comment on Instagram
Pictures like ten weeks ago, fame made you an insta friend
Damn I really hate that, tryna adjust to the love and hate
Take a nigga back like 8 track, tell em Ben
Give me credit for my contributions, to my city, to this shit I helped rebuild
Cool ain’t cool no more, we made it cool still
No lames allowed and the skinny niggas rule, get money

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 3 – Young Dolph]
Fuck the fame, fuck my phone, fuck these niggas, fuck these hoes
Get dough, you already know how this shit goes
All I know is stay down ten toes
Keep the burner on me for any niggas talking shit
Better be ready to get low
And they say that my wrist remind them of Christmas the way my shit glow
I just might pull up and burn an O with Burn One
If you didn’t know, now you know, south Memphis, that’s where I come from
I met lil mama for the first time, now the bitch swear that she want some
Sick of everybody asking me “Dolph, where that money come from?”
What? Nigga you already know, nigga let me borrow that ho
Quit bitching, that’s how the game go
Say that nothing ever stays the same forever, but I swear I never change though
Imma keep some extra strong in my swisher and some mud in my Faygo

[Hook][x2]
