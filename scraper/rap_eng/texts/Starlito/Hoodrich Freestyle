I dont sleep, im tired, i feel wired like codeine

My traphouse with my name on the lease
My drank plug with my name on the script
Ain't it a trip how i drink i dont sip
Lose so much money may think im a crip
Whatup cuz?
By the way, im starlito
45 bullet holes larger than a peephole
Colorblind on my grind for the root of evil
Shoutout to white people
Purple drank, blue drank. og limegreen
Nah mean
Hood rich like my nigga lil kink?
[x2]

Peach question out clean?
Damn this shit look plumb
Damn look what i done
Count the money so fast, damn near sprained my thumb
Just last night lil shawty tried to hit my sprite
Said her mouth went numb
Engineer on the run, im so dope
Lyrics so serious, high risk for conspiracy, uh
Surrounded by love i dont fear anyone
On top of that im in here with my gun
???
Sellin 150 dollars sweet 16
Rollin round, tryna down all these LBs
4 racks for the...
Meet me out east
Young vin in the vid tryna run up a check
Camera fucked up dont know what to expect
Clutching my buddy i love her to death
Me and all my shooters, and im by myself
Lito
Shout out to c note
Got enough dough to bake this for the projects
Dropped fried turkey, passed them out like nino
Still affiliated with the criminals
Lil nigga still hatin, subliminal
Probably prayin that i'll mention you
All my tools got extensions, stick and move
You think i give a fuck about a first week sale?
Bitch im thuggin, still servin
And i'll put that on my dirty ass scale
Smoke til my eyes close, sip til my eyes close
You gotta feel me like braille
I'll short your order, might short you a quarter
Just tryna stay off of the voice recorder
Thumbin through guap, my stomach in knots
Im wonderin why, you wanna be something you not
Til the winter turn the glass so cold
And the summer too hot
Chop chop chop
Without warning without warning
Still run in your spot
Til you tell it to the judge
Dont take this shit to trial
I could tell he wouldn't budge
I could tell the DA jealous with a grudge
The nigga say they sellin drugs
Never had a plug
Never

Someone tell me where the hell is the mud
Im rollin round, im cluckin back
They cuttin it, what the fuck is that
Im bout to fuckin spaz
By myself, no puff and pass
Ride, like a got a bus pass
But it won't be no bustin back

Just livin like the song say
On my way home
Not gonna take the long way
