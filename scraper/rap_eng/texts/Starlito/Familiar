[Chorus:]
I need a place where I'm familiar at
Where niggas don't talk around my back
Niggas ain't worried about my set
They gots my back, I got their back
I need a place where I'm familiar at
Where nigga won't rob me
All niggas love me, fresh off of rugby
I need a place where I'm familiar at
You niggas blame it on fate, I need to eat
I need a place where I'm familiar at[x2]
I need a place where I'm familiar

[Verse 1:]
I need a place where I'm familiar
D one who grew up in d ghetto building
D same nigga changed on you, and they in they feelings
D same nigga hating on you
They tryna kill you
Mason ride til my dying day
Wood chipping it forward
And my niggas ain't curve wood
The blessing code, they know me
Gotta rep my shit to my deltae
You should play with me on showday
For the enemies I pray
Spreading these in my face
Nigga, hard to breathe sometimes
Man, all you need is chase the light
Can you give me some shine?
I remain still for all my loved ones
My peers, my nigga without a deal
I know the pain real

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Ah, shit, somewhere I’m familiar
I've been getting high liff
Word some niggas might try to kill you
What niggas might call resilient
Hitching up on the million
Rap niggas are really real
I don't feel them, they chameleons
I'm brilliant, still, I'm fighting for a piece of mind
I'm fighting for a piece right by my name, don't even speak your name
Keep that hind, ya’ll nigga like they want it
I don’t sleep sometime
Surfed up, nerves shot
If I reach out mine
I see them behind the corner
I see them right up d street
Ain't got no rearview I'm just speeding now
An all that jealous shit is weaken em
Fuck niggas want attention, no intention to have no beat
Ma gal keep askin why I be flinchin in my sleep
I keep expenses in my heat, bro

[Chorus:]
I need a place where I'm familiar at
Where niggas don't talk around my back
Niggas ain't worried about my set
They gots my back, I got their back
I need a place where I'm familiar at
Where nigga won't rob me
All niggas love me, fresh off of rugby
I need a place where I'm familiar at
You niggas blame it on fate, I need to eat
I need a place where I'm familiar at[x2]
I need a place where I'm familiar[x2]
Where niggas ain’t worried bout what I got
They just happy to see me building
Niggas be you better than us bitch when you tryin to walk away
But you a punk wit some issues, niggas got nuttin to say!

[Bridge:]
This one for me
One is there for my cousin, one ride we all ride
Real leather shit I go through wall size holes
Streets taught me neva let shit slide them die for it
Money spent on chains an video
We fuckin rap nigga

[Chorus]
