[Intro-Starlito]
Yeah, fried turkey, I'm outchea. I'm really outchea. Turkey bag game, Yeah turkey bag game

Stretch a four to a nine
Short a million times (Ahh)
Fuck em when they check up then go flex on (Yeah)
I'm killin, I'm killin, Lito

[Verse 1-Starlito]
Crayola my cars, free Lil Boosie
Keep the line around the building, got me riding around no ceiling (Skrttt)
Riding around with no feelings, if you play with me, I'm killing
Make me jump out and get silly, dump out nine millies
Fuck I'm talkin bout, we got big tools with the trash bags for the chopper shells
Yeah, we ain't missing, but we'll leave you missing
You niggas suspect, you fit the description
I'm looking for a gudda bitch that can get the prescription (Yeah)
I got them hundred dollar quarters, fuck with me (fuck with me)
One twenty at the twelv (twelve) , you better have your scale
You a puss, Vagisil, Massengill
Your baby mama pussy (aghhh) had that slut bitch stashing pills

If I wasn't rapping, be in traffic with them vacuum seal
Pass it to the passenger four racks get you some daffodil
Riding 2K14, five for bout a half a mil
I throw my shows like money off album sales and I don't have a deal

Bitch I, bitch I grind hard (Lito), ain't much more to the story (Nope)
This nigga say I owe him (lyin) but he couldn't be looking for me (Bitch)
Said fuck riding foreign cause they're soldiers over there warring (Yeah)
Mr. president, do you at least have some healthcare for him?

I pay more taxes than my next door neighbor
He don't get profiled
So I wake up in a Bugatti, fell asleep in a dope pile
This coke droppin' been going on for eight years straight
Oh thrills charging twelve to my album brick blade, 'ey
Then I, then I dropped my first mixtape
Outer limits, prison passin, we was clubbing every day
In the projects all day
Shootin twenty, bet whatever
I came a long way, glad I got my shit together

Bitch I grind hard, ain't much more to the story (niggas ain't no killers, man)
Y'all niggas ain't no killers, man, y'all niggas some hoes
You niggas ain't no killers, you niggas some hoes
