Shawty, ride with me, smoke with me (one time)
Get high with me, joke with me (in no time)
You gon' love me, hopefully, you close to me
Shit, that's how it's supposed to be

A week without you is like a year
She say she miss me more, that's what I like to hear
Hey, I ain't have to write this here
I just visualize my wife, Then walk up on the mic, like
Shawty you got curves like the Tour De France course
Real, so I respect everything you stand for
I can see that she's there for better or for worse
Met her in the club, then she texted me from work
She wake up and handle her business, that's what's sexy 'bout her
Freak like she do it for a living, I think no less about her
Say how I run the streets, that stress her out
Her credit score the reason why I can say bet the house
Hold this, hide that, drive these over there
And if it turns out fine, you gon' help me blow this dough, I swear
Time is money, ride with me, we both can share
Maybe it's the dro 'cause, shawty, I ain't even know I cared

How we go from talking wedding vows
To arguing to the point that we can't reconcile
So what you saw a picture when she called
That ain't worth the hollering and knocking pictures off the wall
They past tense, forget about them all
What ever your past is, I'm past it, I'm different then them all, I'm All-
Star, so when the blunt reaches roach, tell 'em bring us some more
And put the do not disturb hanger on the knob of the door
And we can start off slow, yeah, for a minute
Then you gon' run for your life when I stand up in it
You heard what I said shawty and I meant it
This our chance in a lifetime, you playing with it
Grown man shit, no kidding, come fuck with a thug
Then put your face in this pillow, we got company love
Can't get enough of it, like they can't get enough of the club
That's why you need to leave here with me, shawty whats up
