[Intro: Starlito & Don Trip]
Ahh shit
Bro she gon' kill you
I'ma be dead in a ditch somewhere

[Chorus: Don Trip]
I ain't been home in the last thirty days
I been on the road, doin' shows, gettin' paid
Room full of bitches, do whatever backstage
Pop a pill, blow a kill, now they goin' both ways
My old lady called, hit ignore on her
Diggin' in the bitch guts like an organ donor
Nigga this the life, you gotta feel me
If my girl find out she gon' kill me
Said if my girl find out she gon' kill me
If my girl find out she gon' kill me
Nigga this the life, gotta feel me
But if my girl find out she gon' kill me
If my girl find out

[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Call me Mr. Don Trip or mister pour it in her mouth
Lady catch you and she probably throw a nigga out
I ain't called all day, I'm preoccupied
She ask me where I'm at, I'm trying not lie
Tell her I ain't get no service, she like why you playin'?
I seen you liking bitches pictures all on Instagram
Damn, see she feed up all these independent posts
About how these groupie hoes never want you when you broke
I'm like here we go again, I'm like well she got a point
But this bitch just did the splits like this bitch ain't got no joints
I got all sort of lies for her soon as I get home
If she don't buy it, take her shopping, buy her anything she want
And she'll forgive me

[Chorus: Don Trip]
I ain't been home in the last thirty days
I been on the road, doin' shows, gettin' paid
Room full of bitches, do whatever backstage
Pop a pill, blow a kill, now they goin' both ways
My old lady called, hit ignore on her
Diggin' in the bitch guts like an organ donor
Nigga this the life, you gotta feel me
If my girl find out she gon' kill me
Said if my girl find out she gon' kill me
If my girl find out she gon' kill me
Nigga this the life, gotta feel me
But if my girl find out she gon' kill me
If my girl find out

[Verse 2: Starlito]
If my girl find out
Don't post that shit online, don't want the world to find out
Lately all my bitches, they been saving text messages
Screenshotting the images, plan to present it as evidence
Precisely why I never take them hoes to my residence
Game sold separately, I ain't no celebrity
When I wasn't wrong I was coming home to the same old questioning
Wait, she gon' think I'm lying even when I don't
She don't realize what I really want
She like you so on your grind can't use your telephone
I just realized I ain't never home
It's 4 AM and this the seventh song

[Chorus: Don Trip]
I ain't been home in the last thirty days
I been on the road, doin' shows, gettin' paid
Room full of bitches, do whatever backstage
Pop a pill, blow a kill, now they goin' both ways
My old lady called, hit ignore on her
Diggin' in the bitch guts like an organ donor
Nigga this the life, you gotta feel me
If my girl find out she gon' kill me
Said if my girl find out she gon' kill me
If my girl find out she gon' kill me
Nigga this the life, gotta feel me
But if my girl find out she gon' kill me
If my girl find out
