[Verse 1:]
None of my b*tches ain’t sh*t
Gun in my britches and one of you n*ggas can get it
But really I'm wheeling and dealing
I do the digits with mids (Trash Bag Gang)
Yeah I said that right
My office is always the kitchen
I’m a big dog you little b*tch
You kidding (kitten), p*ssy
That pistol stay with me f*cking right I’m a hood n*gga
And I write good but if a p*ssy play with me, well, (n*gga f*ck your favorite dj) t
That pistol stay with me f*cking right I’m a hood n*gga
And I write good but if a p*ssy play with me well then it's good riddance
Sauce dripping on my Scottie Pippens feel like I’m walking on air
Meant to say Balenciagas got a lot of 'em I just bought 4 pair

[Verse 2:]
I said I’m so I’m so so I’m so player I got pimp with me pink with me and they
Lit like a role flair I got your b*tch with me triple tripping she wants me to go bare
I tie my J’s up tight as sh*t and kick the b*tch out my hotel
This sh*t just flew the coop
I got my eyes on a newest coupe
Made a snowman said trip God damn I don’t know a n*gga as cool as you
I'm bout my cake like a Susie Q
I’m at Benihana chilling with a Lucy Liu
Me and Craig like Dre and Snoop
We prolly got codeine in the gin and juice

[Verse 3:]
They pretending to and we been the truth
Put that on a pin from Houston
Part of me poured out
Man my uncle Bun B said go hard
You know it's UGK for life, right?
That mean I’m underground til I’m underground
Just come from dumpin off a bunch of pounds
In a country town hundred thousand coming monthly now

Your jungle my stomping grounds school of hard knocks
You can probably find your b*tch in the lost and found
Find out the check there I’m the that b*tch with bells on
All my sh*t legitted and I’m still scared to use my cell phone
N*ggas ain’t playing fair these n*ggas plain fed

[Verse 4:]
If you scared say you scared you better off playing dead
Still wear some brand names I say you’re brain dead
Save your damn change yeah you’re better off saving it
I feel like f*ck shoppin triple up the profit
Arizona got a real socket
Splash time touchdown with the Houston Rockets
And I’m pulling up on anybody
Killakal what it is n*gga
Paul Wall what it do fool
Bun B those words were encouragement
Really meant the world to me
And for that I salute you
Propane young n*gga don’t change
Dope game and it really don’t change
Discretion used to be mandatory
Nowadays they show them everything (tell em everything)
Rap game done got a little strange
Everybody got beef with everybody
Nobody wanna say nobody name
F*ck that might as well show love
I stay to myself cause that’s who I trust
Sometimes look in the mirror say f*ck it and go and make music on behalf of the drugs
