[Verse 1: Wilx]
I don’t like to text, that’s why she calling me
When it come to sex, that pussy talk to me
Have her seeing stars, no astrology
Space age pimping, nigga
This that Ball and G
Mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta
Get that thing more wetter, dripping dripping dripping
Dripping down her thigh, say she down to ride
So I gotta let her, she came first, gold medal
Knew it was a go when I met her, I’m the kind of fella
Have her sweating like Keith, gritting on her teeth
Make the moment last forever
Crazy and clever, damn, a handsome young devil
Know you ain’t supposed to say never
But you’ll probably never ever ever ever find a nigga that’ll do it more better
On a whole other level
Kicking flavor, got to make her feel special
Got to make her feel special, ain’t another that can do it

[Chorus: Wilx]
Mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta
Know I do it mo' betta
Champagne moet, uh
That'll get her more wetter, more wetter, more wetter
Mo' betta, young King, got young Coretta’s
Selling dreams and whatever
Nuttin on it not in it cause a nigga know better, know better
Mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta
Know I do it mo' betta
Champagne moet, uh
That'll get her more wetter, more wetter, more wetter
Mo' betta, young King, got young Coretta’s
Selling dreams and whatever
Nuttin on it not in it cause a nigga know better, know better
Mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta

[Verse 2: Starlito]
I don’t like to talk, that’s why she textin'
Hope she get the message, I ain’t tryna kick it
She message saying I used to mess with her best
Still her heard you had her breast, nigga vet and a check
On my way up in the FN, breadwinner like Kevin
I just want neck, give me head, yeah the rest sold separate
Ain’t no kissing, Flex got his four fifth and you know it’s no slipping
Extra ammunition, yeah they call it an extension
Head spitter to her cliter, whole clip won’t fit in, woah!
Got a thick young bitch just want them new Jordans
But I swear she so nosey like Pippen
I’m just bullshitting, no commitment
Might catch me [?] lying to her like I miss you, ooh
Lito, Lito, Lito, that’s what they usually say
Then I tell her bend over let me see it, I'm on that UGK
I’m on my level, get on my schedule
Don’t you ever, never, never, never come around here no more
Ho you know better

[Chorus: Wilx]
Mo' betta, know I do it mo' betta
Champagne moet, uh
That'll get her more wetter, more wetter, more wetter
Mo' betta, young King, got young Coretta’s
Selling dreams and whatever
Nuttin on it not in it cause a nigga know better, know better
Mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta
Know I do it mo' betta
Champagne moet, uh
That'll get her more wetter, more wetter, more wetter
Mo' betta, young King, got young Coretta’s
Selling dreams and whatever
Nuttin on it not in it cause a nigga know better, know better
Mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta

[Verse 3: Wilx]
First round on the couch, then I wanted more
Second round on the floor, beat it down till it sore
She can feel it in her core, stand up in it
Full attention, I’m on all ten, she’s on all fours
Ain’t timid, take more than a minute for a nigga finish
She be like Wilx is this all yours, this all yours?
Reassurance, ain’t tapping out, endurance
Proggressive, know I got a cool little flow, ain’t talking bout insurance
Can’t nobody do it how I do it like I do it when I do it cause I do it
Squeezing all on the booty, know I like em juicy
Get that thing moving, fuck around and do a movie
Know I got to keep it moving
Put that ass to sleep, weak off in her knees, can’t walk, won’t speak
Roommates know my name by the end of the week, ooh

[Chorus: Wilx]
Mo' betta, know I do it mo' betta
Champagne moet, uh
That'll get her more wetter, more wetter, more wetter
Mo' betta, young King, got young Coretta’s
Selling dreams and whatever
Nuttin on it not in it cause a nigga know better, know better
Mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta
Know I do it mo' betta
Champagne moet, uh
That'll get her more wetter, more wetter, more wetter
Mo' betta, young King, got young Coretta’s
Selling dreams and whatever
Nuttin on it not in it cause a nigga know better, know better
Mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta, mo' betta
