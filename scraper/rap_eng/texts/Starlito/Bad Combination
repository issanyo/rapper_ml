[Verse 1: Dee-1]
Robin Williams died
Committed suicide
Three weeks later my friend did
Now it’s just the crew and I
Sitting ‘round wondering what happened
Guess it’s foolish pride
Thinking it can’t happen to one of us
No not you and I
Who am I
Missed the funeral cause I feel poor inside
I been battling my own demons
Ain’t no new surprise
Contemplated driving off the road in my newest ride
Same fate as Robin
Different route like 3 and 4 , 2 and 5
Both equal seven
Tell your reverend that my heaven sure ain’t here on earth
Money, fame what it’s worth
When you’re in the dirt
So what I ain’t in the dirt
Sunday I was in the church
Saturday I was… man I ain’t putting that in this verse
They judge me and love me
Hug me and mug me
God is good
That broad is bad
Most of all this world is ugly
Going on vacation
Mentally I need sedation
Pray for me
I see you at the final destination

[Hook: Dee-1 and (Starlito)]
Hesitation leads to frustration
It got me pacing
Round and round and round in this basement
My mind racing
Life ain’t no erasing
This reality we facing  (No patience and the lack of cash)
That’s a bad combination (She want more and that’s all he had)
That’s a bad combination ( Thugging, druging)
That’s a bad combination (She love him, he doesn’t)
That’s a bad combination (All bad)
That’s a bad combination

[Talking: Starlito]
Ain’t no shame in my game
I just (you know)
I want somebody to do better or be better

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Bad Combination
They got different expectations
Money been funny lately
Mix that with impatience
His ol’ lady late
The last thing they need is a baby
Lust turns into hatred
Next it’s child support payment
It happens every day like this battle I have with satan
They might just decapitate all the rappers with education
Wouldn’t surprise me
They want us blind
I see the signs
The unique should unify
Wish the real would realign
I need more resistence the harder I grind
Can’t let it break my will
You smoke weed or sip lean
That don’t make you real
Survivors guilt
I won’t sell my soul
I still pay the bills
And once I peak I might disappear like Dave Chappelle
That’s just how I feel
Two days ago I made bail
And I making up for lost time
Trying to make it where I can’t fail
Pistol and a sack
That’s a bad combination
Felony situation
I’m just telling you what I’m facing
Man it’s crazy

[Hook: Dee-1 and (Starlito)]
Hesitation leads to frustration
It got me pacing
Round and round and round in this basement
My mind racing
Life ain’t no erasing
This reality we facing  (No patience and the lack of cash)
That’s a bad combination (She want more and that’s all he had)
That’s a bad combination ( Thugging, druging)
That’s a bad combination (She love him, he doesn’t)
That’s a bad combination (All bad)
That’s a bad combination
