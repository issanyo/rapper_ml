[Intro]
Grind Hard
Ah, Lito
GhettOut
Funerals & Court Dates 2
This what they want

[Verse 1]
I been feeling a lot of hate
I been chillin' because of this case
I ain't got no teardrop tattoos but it's written all over my face
What they won't give me I'ma take
Feel like the enemy of the state
Been on that 1738 straight, chased it with D'usse
Can't even drive, got too much raids
I might just pull a GTA
I was so full of TAC with 30K at TSA, yeah
Preach it, my grind top of the line, won't find no defects
Don't got no regrets, know I'm gon' be blessed
Oh I know secrets, no I ain't see shit
That's how I'ma keep it, discreet from the streets
My nigga they lockin' niggas up over your tweets
And fake news really the police, look
I got big goals, bigger dreams
Fuck these hoes, one in the hole
Fully load my magazine 'cause I got too much agony
I remember when I could barely put in on a bag of weed
Now I got that bag, I put it in they face like acne
All I did was imagine it, call that shit black magic
How I manifest my destiny, probably 'cause I'm so passionate
Y'all lil niggas ain't havin' it, we was brought up different
That shit you call ballin' that's living average, plus where y'all livin' at
I just spend to get it back, got two rentals tinted black
Couple niggas sending threats, I just grin, I'm winning, facts
I just strengthened my defense, I just sent 'em twenty stacks
I just got my girl a gun license, she get me ten new gats
Yeah I really been through that, and she getting too attached
And I'm going back to Cali, 'bout to ship me a few packs
They just cancelled two of my shows, cost me and Trip a lot of racks
Wish I could get out of the streets, I'm tryna rap my way out the trap

[Outro]
Lito, Lito
Get up out of the streets, I'm tryna rap my way out the trap
Get up out of the streets, I'm tryna rap my way
Wish I could get up out of the streets, I'm tryna rap my way out the trap
You can't do what he's doing
Across the country and nobody ain't know you?
