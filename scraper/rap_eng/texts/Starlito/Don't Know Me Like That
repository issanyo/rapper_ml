[Intro-Propain]
Nah, Nah you don't know me like that

Why you judging me for my flaws, but listen dawg
You don't know me like that

[Chorus-Propain]
I done seen it all, stripes in the stars

(Starlito-Nah)
Nah

[Verse 1-Starlito]
Nah you have no idea, I don't know why I'm here
Gotta go see her, after I leave the galleria
I rock expensive gear, but really couldn't pretend to care (No)
I wear this shit for three days, and pull up anywhere (Lito)
Paper piling up cause I'm passionate
Porsche Panamera, plus I still put a stash in it, Yeah
Backpack full of ? and backwood packages, baby bottles of activist, call it the last kiss
I'm high with a tech, make that bitch do my ad-Libs (bahh)
Serve ya a 50 pack, if you can make it to Cashville
Homie just got a birder like it taking a bath
Say you can get a price break, if you can break it in half
Grind Hard

[Chorus-Propain]
I done seen it all, stripes in the stars
Why you judging me for my flaws, but listen dawg
You don't know me like that
Nah, Nah you don't know me like that
Girl, I'm loving that physique, (yeah) its trill when we meet (uhh)
Hit ya seven days of the week, but please believe
You don't know me like that
Nah, Nah you don't know me like that
Nah
Yeah

[Verse 2-Propain]
I put my grind over everything
Grind over everything
I hope that you can understand it, trill niggas since ?
If that girl ridin with me, its likely she choose
Since I rap they all think that I ?
But if you in the shadow, shit you ain't my type I suppose
The money bring envy, make the shit knife to you bro
I seen it, the shit so wide, and life so cold I mean it
This ain't no rap, I write my soul, I'm genius
Clever, they saw Kings live forever

[Chorus-Propain]
I done seen it all, stripes in the stars
Why you judging me for my flaws, but listen dawg
You don't know me like that
Nah, Nah you don't know me like that
Girl, I'm loving that physique, (yeah) its trill when we meet (uhh)
Hit ya seven days of the week, but please believe
You don't know me like that
Nah, Nah you don't know me like that
Nah

[Verse 3- Don Trip]
Matter of fact you don't know me at all
When the ends run low, than my focus is all
I be ballin extra hard for all the folks I done lost
So I cop my Air Jordans before the go to the mall
I be grindin all year I never know when to pause
But I know how bad these mother fuckers want me to fall
At times I've failed, but I ain't quit
I ain't bail, I ain't break, I prevailed
And I think we all know the grind sold separately
Mr. Don Trip I'm fly as you will never be
The top ain't where you headed, than your aimed fucked up
Just like me an my Stepbrother got the gang fucked up
God Speed

[Chorus-Propain]
I done seen it all, stripes in the stars
Why you judging me for my flaws, but listen dawg
You don't know me like that
Nah, Nah you don't know me like that
Girl, I'm loving that physique, (yeah) its trill when we meet (uhh)
Hit ya seven days of the week, but please believe
You don't know me like that
Nah, Nah you don't know me like that
Nah
