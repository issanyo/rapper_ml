[Intro: Starlito]
You know they say they put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill
That's what they say

[Hook: Starlito]
All them whips and them chains that you slaved for
When it was all said and done, you should've saved more
I'm worth less in the jail than in the graveyard
Heard I'm too black to play the race card

[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Wouldn't conform so the label hit the panic button
You know they can't stand a nigga when you stand for something
I do what I want when I want, I never had a budget
And I don't answer to not a soul, so don't ask me nothing
Offer me a mansion and a Lamborghini
Where you been? I've got babies ain't no way to feed em off no per diem
I hear family this, and we the best, and it's a movie
Meanwhile, they in the office tryna stick it to me
I told em fuck em, I'm buckin, you can't do shit but sue me
I get paid cash anyway, so don't misconstrue it
I'll gladly go back to pitchin, I don't give a shit
Got out my deal then I got rich, independence is the shit
Godspeed

[Hook: Starlito]
All them whips and them chains that you slaved for
When it was all said and done, you should've saved more
I'm worth less in the jail than in the graveyard
Heard I'm too black to play the race card

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Motherfuck this legislation and the gentrification
Granny just work, pay bills, never been on vacation
You shoot a jumper or you get a 2nd rate education
Underground, I fuck around, never get played on the station
But that's okay, I tell the truth, the only way I feel free
They killed my favorite rapper Pac for that, hope they don't kill me
They pull me over, I go to court, then they gon say I'm guilty
Even when all your money clean, they make you pay a lil fee
What if instead of prison sentences, they gave us degrees
Ain't it ironic that they lock us up for playing with keys
Save your receipts cause freedom ain't free, and lawyers ain't cheap
And I know, I got court on the 18th

[Hook: Starlito]
All them whips and them chains that you slaved for
When it was all said and done, you should've saved more
I'm worth less in the jail than in the graveyard
Heard I'm too black to play the race card

[Verse 3: Starlito & Don Trip]
They say we're new slaves, but really nothing's changed
We're just addicted to our cellphone's and brand names
I prolly look just like a slave with all these damn chains
And Trip got so many whips, you'd think he got caught tryna escape
They prolly wanna chop my feet off for Kunta's sake
But I hop out that bitch and spray like I'm fumigating
And all I see is dollar signs like hallucinations
I promise to leave my fuckin mark like a used eraser
And I'm like fuck the world until I come again
I'm bout to buy some more guns and wait for Trump to win
Man, wish I can buy some time for a bunch of my friends in the pen
They watching how you move, who you with, what you spend
You a felon, you ain't tryna see that judge again
And you can't take this shit to trial cause they gon rub it in
Damn it man, got too much pride to do the running man
The rap game is like the same old sunken dance
I'd of show up at the polls with my gun in hand
And kill em all for my dog like Son of Sam
Ah nah, y'all don't understand
Had to rob Peter and Paul to pay Sally Mae and Uncle Sam

[Hook: Starlito]
All them whips and them chains that you slaved for
When it was all said and done, you should've saved more
I'm worth less in the jail than in the graveyard
Heard I'm too black to play the race card
