[Hook:]
I just been
Standin on mine own two
Doing what I want to (x2)

[Verse 1:]
I just been fuckin up a chick gettin dusted
Flat black foreign whip that bitch look dusty
How I got this money lets not discuss it
(I don't want to talk about it)
Just know I am not to be trusted
I am not ashammed of my intelligence
Smart enough to get rid of the evidence
Right now Iâ€™m just tryin to beat this felony
Plus momma want this new whip it cost 70
Grind hard cuz I got a whole lotta bills
These niggas dont even know how to keep it real
I just been staying low and five different cribs
The killing part is how I really live




[Hook:]





[Verse 2:]
Douglasville (?) PD they took my FN
Like I won't gone get another weapon?
Condo life, i feel like George Jefferson
Homicide detectives on all on Jefferson
Elroy in that coupe just like a Jetson
Just two years ago we was finessing
Just two days ago man i was thuggin
Still on it, ain't been asleep or nothin
You still a fuck nigga even if you hustlin
Fuck that bitch without an introduction
Ring it up i need some tax deductions
Told Def jef mother fuck your budget
