I been lying to em like I love em
Later on she gon' hate me
Moved on like it’s nothing
Maybe cause it don’t phase me
She keep telling me I broke her heart
Thought that I would leave my old lady
Way before I had license
I’ve been driving these hoes crazy
Driving these hoes crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
I been driving these hoes crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
I been driving these hoes crazy

[Verse 1: Starlito]
This little bitch bought me a challenger, cash
I can’t even brag, she put the police on my ass
Damn, homie he just told me he out of gas
You know me, I’m an OG and keep OG by the bag
Texting me emojis, I’m like ‘ho please’, I just laugh
Both these niggas owe me, I just hope they got my cash
Been kicking it off with two chicks and yeah both them bitches bad
I sent them hoes a group text and now both them bitches mad
I’m sorry

[Verse 2: Petty]
