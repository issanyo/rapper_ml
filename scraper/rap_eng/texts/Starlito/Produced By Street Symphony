[Verse 1]
They say man’s best friend is dog
Girl’s best friend is diamond
Had a dream I bought my dogs some diamonds
Yeah we all was shining
Then I woke up and I lost [?]
A good woman, it’s so hard to find one
Best of all my exes, wish that I could combine them
He don’t wife em, he concubines them
God
I said, I said
Got tired of running towards the pain
Stop running off them lames that want to come up off your name
Same thing that make you laugh will make you weak
So now I grin when I see police, black sheep
Deep, not really I’m shallow
I used to battle with addiction to adolescence, even as an adult
Used to want to be a dope boy forever
Grown man, shit I know I know better
Used to want to be a dope boy forever
Grown man, shit I know I know better
Mama ain’t raised no fool, mama ain’t raised no ho
I’m just being honest, bad karma
Promise you , it ain’t no joke
But I’ve been through (grindin)
Watchin for the robbing crew, they plottin too
Plus it ain’t no coke, so in other words it ain’t no hope
Niggas still spending money like they can’t go broke
(Get your ho)
Got to watch the way you hug me
Be dun poked you with my pistol
Pockets poke out from the racks, probably smelling like a sack
I took a loss, I got it back, I barely missed it
Did a summer then 350, they call it presidential
I got it it from the banks, somewhere private, out of state
Flying me right back in the hood, tryna find out what it weigh
You use to have money, I'm getting used to having money
See what the boosters grab for me, snatch bout 20 pairs of Js
Ay, that was just the other day
I’m the type to hit the bank twice today
(Bitch cut your ringer off)
