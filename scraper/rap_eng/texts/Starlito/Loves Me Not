[Intro]
I think I want a bitch, but…
I don’t want a bitch, you know I want a bitch
But I think I want a bitch
I don’t want no bitch, I don’t wanna fuck nigga, fuck it

[Hook]
Diamonds in my watch, I got 5 spots
Bend lil mama over and she said I hit her spot
Hollows in my Glock, extra 30 shots
She ask me what I like to do, I said smoke and show
She loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
She loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
I said she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
But I could give a fuck because I love my block

[Verse 1]
Diamonds in my watch but fuck that
I had yo bitch over my nigga, house smoking, have a real cigar
I think she sprung me ‘cause she didn’t even think about you when she on that shit
But she just like how I pull her hair when I’m from the back, oh I don’t trust that
Fuck that bitch, fuck that nigga
The Young Dolph nigga think he the shit, wuddup with that nigga?
You know wuddup with me
I’m just chillin, my nigga we’re popping
Counting money, you might have her rock n rolling
Skinny nigga, body swollen
Rolling up this weed while I put these balls together
Feeling like rise up tell mama we gon be rich forever
Lil mama say she loves me, she loves me not
But I could give a fuck because I love my block

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m just kickin it like hot toss
Me myself and my Glock
You know how many shots I got
No safety, I’m fine ho
I’m a busy man I’m like wild bucks
No beef on my town all my town she like
So all you getting, take time boss
Sliding down to yo girlfriend, she ready to ride like a tat show
Scoop her up like Basket Roberts then get her weded in a drive by
I don’t sleep with her, she can’t spend the night
One eye open like Cyclops
Dollar signs all in my eyes, ain’t never needed no eye drops
Not a day to make mo paper
I grind harder than a pro skater
No friendships, just kissin niggas
In other words I owe no favors
Black guy, all black
Darth Vader, no light saber
That gold peck is my life savior
Keep mo pussy than a vibrator

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She keep askin me what’s wrong and why my clip so long
What’s in that Styrofoam and why my weed so strong
Now she wanna know I be in the mall so much
But I just wanna know why she talk so much
She said she love me, she love me not
Plus we just fuckin shop
Just bout some mo ice
Yelling fuck with me ‘cause I’m high
She talkin, she smoking, fuckin bitches, where my pistol at?
I just did her down, kick her out
Think about callin her sister no
Hold on, hello! Who it is?
Call me babe, bitch I got work
Bout to drop yo 16 off the studio but it ain’t no verse
Shawty say she want a purse, I told her sell this gangsta purp
Buggin up surp get bangin off my way
Extend, broken out my shirt
Never take my high

[Hook]
