[Intro: Starlito]
This that
Nardo DaVinci in the streets, ah

[Chorus: MobSquad Snap Sosa]
Keep a real nigga by the peephole
Got some young niggas on go 'bout it
All these niggas talk about is more choppers
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Niggas steady asking 'bout the old molly
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Nigga ain't shit pop, it ain't no shopping
Niggas know I get it for the low probably

[Verse 1: Starlito]
That half a mil hid in a deep hole
Where I buried it at won't tell nobody
All these niggas talk about is Yo Gotti
And that Dolph shit, and they both my partners
And it ain't my business and I don't gossip
Niggas know I'm dealing with own problems
Really had to get it on my own, yeah
Niggas know I'm digging in my own pockets
Baby chopper right here by the driver's seat
Scary niggas don't need to ride with me
Apparently niggas just want a rivalry
But how many niggas down to die with me?
Rest in peace to Slim, riding K'ed up
I'm just tryna see another Christmas tree
Been about a week, wish I could get some sleep
Really one deep, no publicity
I got a couple foreigns and 'bout twenty guns
Coke or the weed, whatever you need
If you want some we got both of 'em
Four spots, thirty hoes, most of 'em don't even want none
But a good time, got a few dimes
Man I can't even lie I need all mine
I'm a real pimp, I don't throw ones
Boomerang the pack, serve you then we jack it
Send a bitch to your peephole
Then I put her in my video, it's Lito
Locked my nigga up in Henry County
Cuz flew in just to get him out
Grind Hard slash MobSquad
Fuck how you feel about it, bitch we really 'bout it

[Chorus: MobSquad Snap Sosa]
Keep a real nigga by the peephole
Got some young niggas on go 'bout it
All these niggas talk about is more choppers
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Niggas steady asking 'bout the old molly
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Nigga ain't shit pop, it ain't no shopping

[Verse 2: MobSquad Snap Sosa]
Baby chopper by the peephole
Got a nigga lookin' like a sweet ho
Tell him where he live and how he eat so
We could be discreet when we creep low
Shaking like a stripper, we'll apply the pressure
Pull up with the pistol on the seat bro
Paying for protection, we just teach lessons
Bulletproof vest and now he beast mode
Thirty in the clip, fourteen in the pocket
We ain't really stressin' 'bout a reload
We was gettin' money, clutching on them rockets
Pull up with them choppers, now the street cold
Fillin' up they pockets, got these youngins ready
For to take a nigga like he free dope
Two up in his head like a free throw
Go see if he dead, he gave him three more
Nigga why you playin', dollars on your head
Got these niggas smackin' for the C-notes
Know his nose bleeding when he see dope
Trigger finger itching when I see dope
Take him for the joe like a free phone
Know his last shower, no it's no pity
Women and children nigga, no pity
We can't shy away from the G code

[Chorus: MobSquad Snap Sosa]
Keep a real nigga by the peephole
Got some young niggas on go 'bout it
All these niggas talk about is more choppers
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Niggas steady asking 'bout the old molly
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Nigga ain't shit pop, it ain't no shopping
Keep a real nigga by the peephole
Got some young niggas on go 'bout it
All these niggas talk about is more choppers
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Niggas steady asking 'bout the old molly
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Nigga ain't shit pop, it ain't no shopping

[Verse 3: MobSquad Snap Nard]
Rest in peace to Slim, I'm riding K'ed up
I'm in the drop, tryna see things different
I just want the money bag, really I'm ballin'
They said that on the fly, one call you can get it when you need it
2012 molly, I got it
Pull up to the Shell park and hop out it
All of my [?] got a low and start beatin', no boppin'
When it's out you ain't gon' cop it
Just know I keep a blood cousin by the peephole
Bitch I might as well be a blood nigga
Came from a long line of thugs
No coincidence I'm runnin' with the thug niggas
Got some money, step off in the kitchen
AKA the laboratory for the drug dealers
I'll come cook it for you if you call
My numbers through the roof, goofies in the phone nigga
Shit real on this side of the peephole
Got xans, they excited for people
It's band for quarter pound of the reefer
Got some young niggas pullin' your fire, they all in cream mode
Breaking down the units, we don't sell 'em big
'05 G's, '07 mid
I'm in the living room with 'bout four choppers
Get it for the low, it ain't no probably

[Chorus: MobSquad Snap Sosa]
Keep a real nigga by the peephole
Got some young niggas on go 'bout it
All these niggas talk about is more choppers
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Niggas steady asking 'bout the old molly
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Nigga ain't shit pop, it ain't no shopping
Keep a real nigga by the peephole
Got some young niggas on go 'bout it
All these niggas talk about is more choppers
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Niggas steady asking 'bout the old molly
Niggas know I get it for the low probably
Nigga ain't shit pop, it ain't no shopping
