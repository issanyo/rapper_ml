[Intro-West]
Aye, aye when hey ain't want me to win
So I said, so I said
(Trakksounds)
I think I'm moving to Houston too bro haha
Aye, when they ain't want me to win (Lito-All this shit)
Trash Bag Gang

[Chorus-Starlito]
I could've been in the pin, stackin fifties, and Bens
Blow the ones, fives, and tens (Grind Hard)
And I'd do it again, all family no friends
Gotta watch of all them (watch) as they watch what I spend (they watchin)
But they ain't want me to win

[Verse 1- West]
I put my chips all in, got my paper within
Saw who was really my friend, the saw we closer than kin
I'm repping F20, I swear that's all I know (haha)
And All my pictures the same 10 years ago (swear to God)
Started hustlin dope, just to get them new J's
Knew I could get my momma out with all this money I saved
And made the club feel so hot, sellin dope was a job
Always keep a couple hustlers, figured out I was smart
Tryna hide it from God, only my grandpa was here
Pastor told me be proud that my grandpa was here
So who I gotta please, (please) government cheese from the center, harmony, and green beans for dinner
I remember all that, I don't lost, crawled back
Took off, and fall back from all this shit (all this shit)
Then come back in the game, Like Mike I'm pissed, wearin a 45 in this bitch, like I never missed

[Chorus-Starlito]
I could've been in the pin, stackin fifties, and Bens
Blow the ones, fives, and tens (Grind Hard)
And I'd do it again, all family no friends (Trip-Lito)
Gotta watch of all them (watch) as they watch what I spend (they watchin) (Trip-Yeah)
But they ain't want me to win
(Trip-But they ain't want me to win)

[Verse 2-Don Trip]
I guess I'm an underdog, but it doesn't bother cause me I'm flyer than underdog
Appetite from destruction, coming from my second  helping
Against all odds, with one, three, five, seven
Know, I don't think ya get it, but that don't mean I'm quit it
Bought my momma a benz, just so I could say that I did it
Signing to myself was my greatest decision
I feel like a giant, in a room full of midgets
Well its really for the rappers who don't get a fair percentage
But they got a rich image, but that's none of my business
I'm just building stock in this bitch, no assembly
With my cup of success feelin like its half empty
Pitching understand, but I'm swinging for them fences
Strapped, but ill still throw them hands Jack Dempsey
Always on the move, like I rented trucks from Penske
Presidential Trip, getting head accidently from Monica Lewinski's

[Chorus-Starlito]
I could've been in the pin, (Trip-God Speed) stackin fifties, and Bens
Blow the ones, fives, and tens (Grind Hard)
And I'd do it again, all family no friends (Lito)
Gotta watch of all them (watch) as they watch what I spend (they watchin)
But they ain't want me to win

[Verse 3-Starlito]
I shed so many tears, lost some many peers
Faced all of my fears, thankful that I'm here
Lord knows I'm serious, can fill it in my spirit
Wasn't for my lyrics, would've been conspiracy, that's just a theory
God flow, dope as Escobar's, not Pablo, wonder if Nas know
Either way they say I beat the odds tho
Never had a job, and I ain't never had to rob hoe
Now I gotta hundred large, parked in my garage tho
Woah, from sleepin on the couch, where they still sleepin on the floor
I was bumpin T.I. back when he dropped 24
You could pull up on the east, and get a key for 24
Now I get P's for 24 hundred, keep that on the low (shh)
They book me for a 10, and did a feature for the 4 (Lito, lito)
Left my bro homie 60, and next week I got two more (Lito)
Jermaine doing his thing, (yeah) but nah ain't a damn thing changed, but nah I can't complain

[Chorus-Starlito]
I could've been in the pin, (Trip-God Speed) stackin fifties, and Bens
Blow the ones, fives, and tens (Grind Hard)
And I'd do it again, all family no friends
Gotta watch of all them (watch) as they watch what I spend (they watchin)
But they ain't want me to win
They ain't want me to win
I'm Moving to Houston
