[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Okay, I'm trying to convince you, this is for your own good
I'm good to you, bad for you
You might need to listen to your homegirl
Love is in the air
I crack a smile and inhale
Maybe I'm high off the fascination
Maybe that's why the shit fails
Maybe I'll never learn that love hurts 'til shes in love with Someone else
Either way we must evacuate the ship's going down
Save yourself
Life's too short to wonder 'bout what could have been
And please don't travel down memory lane, its full of dead ends
Well, go dry your eyes
You got a long road ahead of you
You gon' need fuel for the drive
Don't worry 'bout me cause I'm in tact
I threw my feelings out bout 50 miles back
Give it 6 months you gon' bounce back
Some nigga from the gram gon' come double tap
Then he gon' seem true and you gon' feel past
I'ma hit you up and make it all relapse
Baby I miss you, baby I'm sorry
I want you back, I'm so broken hearted
I promised I changed, you wanna believe me
Your heart tell you different but you disregard it
We get together it's like we first started
You all on the internet posting your shawty
Then I go and throw everything we just had away
For a bitch I just met at a party
Now ain't life grand

[Hook: Starlito]
I know the truth hurts but I mean every word that I'm sayin'
I'm sorry for playing this not what I planned
Look please understand
I'm just a man that doesn't deserve a 3rd 2nd chance
Said I'm just a man I don't deserve you

[Verse 2: Starlito]
Look, I'm trying to convince you
This for your own good
I'm good to you, bad for you
You might need to listen to your homegirl
Hate explainin' why I ain't come home girl
Or lying through the phone
You're obviously not happy with me
So try it on your own
Tired of you crying cause I'm wrong
And 10 wrongs don't make a right
Used to spend all day fighting
Just to say go on stay the night
Wake up tomorrow just to argue
I always accuse you out of guilt
I ain't proud to admit but I know I ain't shit
And that's truly how I feel, forreal
If I thought I could change then maybe I would
Bet on myself I know baby I should for you and for me
And for karma sake
Losing more sleep every promise I break
They only care 'bout how much I make
Laying up praying the condom don't break
Meanwhile you waiting but I'm not on the way
Ain't life grand

[Hook: Don Trip]
Damn
Although the truth hurts I mean every word that I'm sayin'
I'm sorry for playing this ain't what I planned
Please understand
I'm just a man that doesn't deserve a 3rd 2nd chance
I'm just a man and I don't deserve you
