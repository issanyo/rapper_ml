[Verse:]
In a room full of mirrors I’m surrounded by killers
I don’t f*ck with ya’ll n*ggas like y’all play for the Clippers
Now we get money so we trapping out of villas
It’s like n*gga’s going blind
So now they gotta feel us I know cab got me
RIP my brother die, but like a tennis match it’s f*ck the other side
N*gga’s acting like they want beef like they’re going f*cking ride
Til they get that big mac and they don’t get no f*cking fries
And I don’t care what my homies on
Cause when my back’s against the wall I’m in my comfort zone
It only been two weeks I’m yelling God bless us
I can’t lie I was too weak to be a Paul Bearer
Crying don’t help I keep lying to myself
It’s like n*ggas getting time and I need time to myself
Used to dream I get signed now I’m signed to myself
Feeling so hot headed my mom’s got to melt
Walking down the street Hasaan Rasheed
Little boo bread in the jeep eat sunflower seeds
I miss hooping with Tim at the park carving the carpetual
Before Ray O caught that murder we used to post up and serve kids
No pass just pick and rolls give and goes
No the C gave me the and one mixtape damn we getting old
Skip to my Lou sh*t it’s the truth I already missing my dude
It’s Monday he got picked up on Tuesday no fear no loathing
This ain’t a movie, but I wrote this in Vegas
Alone at the parks place playing solitaire I made that my home
Make this sh*t known solidarity is how we made it so long
My longevity come from consistency
My loyalty don’t come with question marks and my love is all you can get for free
For red dye for him beam f*ck if you disagree
For Elroy for Jake B hope they never pick up queen
Free my young n*gga just a reason I don’t know if I should mention
The way they speak in the court appearances seeking a shorter sentence
Never mind the fact that these police breaching our fourth amendment
Shoot you and say f*ck yo breath so you know he meant it
I don’t need a cosign and I don’t want a co defendant
Codeine in my system don’t believe it’s coincidence
Kids don’t do drugs plus lean too expensive
I ain’t talking about the price
It could cost you your life
Kidney failure from heavy doses and all this what
I just did this sh*t thought it never was right
I just took my flowers and a broad in the light
See you call it music I call it my life
(Lexy don’t grin it’s something that I don’t sleep introversion)
Wrote this alone in vegas naw for real
I was at the Aria I had got a free massage
You lose enough money they give you free anything in that mother f*cker
Me and two tone we was in limo first I kept running to the bank to get a little more
Me and Two Tone hit the curb to show a little more
They wouldn’t let us take the drink in
So we drunk the whole drank real quick before we went in the show
Man I couldn’t even get my words out trying to speak to people
