Drop the top, trunk beating, like look at my rims
Pull up on her, like shawty, quit looking, get in
I'm running through that gwap like I'm getting 'em for ten
I said, I'm running through that gwap like I'm getting 'em for ten
They said you ain't ballin' 'til you get you a Benz
Okay, so I got me a Benz
Running through that gwap got my little shawty trying to watch all her friends
They all want me, ain't no telling what I'll drop her off in
Beauty shop in my drop, Nail shop in that Benz
I heard he selling dope, let the gossip begin
These bitch ass rappers wouldn't have pulled up in our projects, I'm saying
I know where all your spots at, nigga, get popped at for playing
I might be at a show if I hop out that van
I might be with your ho, call her sloppy no hands
My price be due below, so I drop off them bands
I'm running through that gwap like I got an advance
But I don't, word to my nigga [?], he locked in the pen
Feds to be exact ran in the spot with the pots and the pans
Been selling dope since I was a teen, I'm gon' stop if I can
Just sold a shirt that said Free Red Dot in Japan
'06 Like Father, Like Son dropped, I got like ten grand (thanks)
'07 I was in the hood with a chopper in my hand
I fucked my own career up, I got no problems saying it
But bitch, I been getting money, fuckin' right, Gotti was paying
I'm just impatient, right, you would not understand
You wasn't around in '08 when I was copping like ten
Of some bullshit regular, me and Dot going ham
In the section 8 metro center with a lot of them grams
Bought a house in '09, stole my neighbors cable
Caught five charges while me and Wayne were on the same label
I barely know that nigga, and I ain't gang related
Never been on TV rapping, so what you can't say is
A nigga put me on, bitch, I put niggas on
And keep getting rid of phones, can't sleep at night, I'm living wrong
I'm ready to take something like they locked up the plug
I'm doing better than ever, but I can't stay off them drugs
Spend so much time in the office, I barely go to the club
But they DTF your TBG, that mean they down to fuck
It make her wet when I call her to help me count it up
Rolling on them ounces, my new old school is getting mounted up
Put my shit on 8's, you could say I'm riding zips
Sell that shit any day, fucking right, I'm trying to flip
Fuck these sucker ass niggas and fuck the politics
If you a graduating senior, apply for my scholarship
I'm doing two of 'em, ain't nothing but a stack, either way I gotta give back
I'm from the hood, yeah, look how I lived that
Look at this game, look at these hypocrites
And how they not kicking the facts, meanwhile, I'm giving them that
Non-Fiction rap, sometimes I hate myself
But one thing none of these haters can't take from me is I made myself
Lito, sometimes I hate myself
One thing none of these haters can't take from me is I made myself
