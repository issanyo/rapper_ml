Q(Stop Pressuring, make me wanna scream...Michael Jackson voice)

(Starlito)
Life's taking its tole on me, nigga stole from me
Old homie done told on me
Tryna keep pushin watchin Menace cleaning off bullets
I lived some of that shit after seeing the footage
Stay to myself, sometimes I'm hella lonely
I'm the only nigga I know won't tell on me
Lil more stress in my face than from my first I.D
Can't worry bout a bitch that ain't worried bout me
Guess it's erry man for himself I learned that the harder way
Like Butch McCrae ,or Penny in nine tray
In Memphis 25 at 30 for a fuckin birdie
I know niggas doin less times for murder
Act like I'm doin fine, I'm hurtin
Elroy told me just grind, I'm workin
And cuz'll be home in like 30 days
Lets sell a million ringtones fuck a murder case
The wordplay keep a nigga out the birdcage
I belong in first place in the first place
It's all about the Benjamins, word to Mase
Bout the Franklins you'll get stomped like Kirk say
Let's take em to church, pray
Reasonable emotion the help is on the way, is on the way

(Don Trip)
(help is on the way, is on the way)
Ok yo President is black, well mines green
I'm not actin', I'm livin out live scenes
Niggas stuck like deers in the high beams
Goin' in for 30 years with no time machine
Young nigga growin' up on the crime scene
Land of the blind they say the man with one eye is king
Still water run deeper than diving team
Servin' since my teens guess its just in our genes
Got a whole half a pound in my levi jeans
Yeah I'm ridin' dirty I ain't refferin' hygiene
Grip the torrents if a nigga tryna' size me
And let that bitch buss till my mothafuckin' eyes ring
I meant ears nevermind me
I ain't seeing clearly can't fix that with visine
Nigga try hard to sleep through the wild dreams
But I'm afraid that i'll wake up hearin sirens
It's called a narcotic breach
Let me speak to my attorney only words they get from me
Boy I'm going through hell as we speak
I got no patience to hear these hypocrites when they preach
Yeah a nigga paid but success bitter sweet
I got a six figure check and my sister got diabetes
Proud of my son, afraid for my niece
Cuz the doctor say she might never learn how to speak
Tryna dry the tears before they make it to my cheek
It's a cold cruel world and you'll freeze if you weak
My brother just called he'll be free in 2 weeks
At this rate, they'll be singin free me in two weeks
Cuz pressure breaks pipes once the limit exceeds
And I'm in it so deep it's gettin difficult to breath
I'm a man with much pride and I am stubborn as can be
So I will take it to the head before I ever take a knee
Say I'm stubborn as can be, so I will take it to the head before I--
I say I'm stubborn as can be, so I will take it to the head before I ever take a
Knee
NOTCH!
