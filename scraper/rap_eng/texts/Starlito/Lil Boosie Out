Intro (sampled from 2Pac interview):
I'm already convicted
My whole life has been turned around
I lost every job, I lost everything
Every opportunity, I can't buy cars
Can't get rent, can't get none of that
But I'm still a survivor, you know
I'm still coming to court, still smiling, still signing autographs
But soon, I'mma go crazy
You know what I'm saying
And it's up to the world
You know America eats its babies
No matter what y'all think about me
I'm still your child, you know what I'm saying
You just can't turn me off like that

Starlito:
At War with Myself
Mike Will, what up?!

(Unh) Hop out the coupe
Ashes all over my Trues
Got cash, I got soldiers, got jewels
Ask her, she know that it's true
So many goons, I no longer have to recruit
It's your fault if it happens to you
I no longer actually shoot
(Ha!) I went on tour with no bodyguards
Fuck around get your whip sprayed
And we ain't washing cars
Might switch bitches, or even swap cars
Never change though, Trash Bag Gang ho
Grind Hard
Got a bitch that be boostin', that's why my shit be exclusive
Say Starlito her favorite, cuz he live all his music
If he say he ridin' strapped, he in the whip with that tooly
They screaming '2Pac's Back', nah bitch I'm Lil Boosie
Alley Boy me a couple rappers bout self-respect
I know I ain't ordinary, but shot it out with the rest
Fuck it
And, now that that's off of my chest
Free Red Dot and Big Guy, cuz they gonna be down for a stretch
(Damn) and they told me smash on all you sucker niggas
Fuck em, nigga, hustle, nigga
Thuggin' til they cuff you, nigga
I love my niggas
Probably why I'm crying looking at club pictures
I remember dropping off them trash bags
Picking up them duffels with ya
(Yeah) Come get your muthafuckin' issue
You just the local news, you were clapping who?
Coulda fooled me, don't make me laugh fool
You're nothing but a 9 to 5 working ass rapper, dude
And I'm speaking on behalf of who? (Lito)
Just keep my name out your mouth, I'm asking you
I mean, you're grown, do what you like, you don't have to
But 2Pac's back, word?
Glocks, I pack two
(Yeah) 2Pac's back
And I know who got smacked
And I know who got jacked
I know I'm that nigga
So that means you not that
I wish you'd please introduce me to the dude out ya raps
