LSR...

I'm still high as I ride in my 7 duece coupe deville
Yall soldiers know my truth be ill
Now with these visions and these bad thoughts runnin through my mind
(can't) stop the clock, see I'm runnin out of time
And as I, tell myself, I'm a changed man
Dressed in black out to jack me a game plan
Situation critical, it's called creepy physical
Hella cold, I'm a BO put off in hella old
Plus it's hard to focus, when you crooked and hopeless
I ain't home, but my mama don't notice
Nationwide with thugs, locc'd out it's just us
With the feds and the police out to bust us. (That's right)
The most prominent, see we stay dominate
And stay wicked, and plus we keep it explicit
Abducted by the streets see it's hard to manage
End up on my block saying we the savage

[Chorus 1]
So you made a little money OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
So you roll on 24's OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
So you pimped a few ho's OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
So you earned a few stripes OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...

I hear you rappin bout the streets, talkin bout pushin deal
When most of yall never seen a triple beam scale
Runnin from weed smell, runnin from dank smoke
Then you get on the mic, talkin bout you been chokin?
Ya lame as mark, buy some heart with yo chump change
Don't make me start, cold hearted droppin punk names
You run thangs? maybe, in yo back yard
You act hard round here you gonna get smacked hard
Baby bash cross game, that's a negative
With savage dreams on my mind so repetative
Let it live, let it go, playa do or die
Cuz fools on my side will tell the other fool to ride
Down to do what I gotta do, to satisfy the man in me
I pull illicit things, my family ain't understandin me
So while I have kids beatin up on the door
I'm gonna crack up and smoke with a corona

[Chorus 2]
So you got a platinum grill OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
So you got a record deal OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
So you pack a few gats OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
You fell in love with yo bitch OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...

The day I wake up, blaze up, lace my J's up
Try to make a couple stacks fo' the days up
Hustle hard ni**a, that's how I live
Only fuckin with fans, my ni**as and relatives
And I dress fly, all clean and keep a fat knot
For supplying all the beats to the have-nots
HP you ain't knowin I run this, so stop braggin
Won't kill what you don't bitch. Or watch your grill hoe
I'll have you iced out, you beat grills with your mutha f*ckin lights out
Lame ni**a, we ain't worried about yo salary
Get off them pills and come back to reality...

[Chorus 1]
So you made a little money OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
So you roll on 24's OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
So you pimped a few ho's OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
So you earned a few stripes OH WOW, what the f*ck yo punk a$$ finna do now...
