[Verse 1: Malik]
They're Gonna Hear Us Down The Halls
You're Leaving Lipstick On The Walls
We Going On & On & On
We Do It Till The Break Of Dawn
Here We Are Alone
I Can Feel Your Body
Screaming My Name
And Both Our Minds Are Blown
Thinkin' Bout The Love
That We Used To Make
Ohh It Felt So Right
The Way We Rocked In The Bed Passed 3
Girl Bring That Thing Next To Mine
And Dim Down The Lights
You Know Its Going Down Tonight

[Hook: Malik]
I Want That Old Thing Back
Ohh Waiting For The One More Night With You
I Want That Old Thing Back
A Throwback Rendezvous For 2
I Want That Old Thing Back
And Do That Little Thing You Do
I Want That Old Thing Back
I Wanna Feel Like I'm Brand New
I Want That Old Thing Back

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Ugh Nena ven aqui
Just Reminiscing
Hugging, Loving & Sexy Kissing
Every Position
And Then I Repertoire
Got A Mint Condition
That Means Its Perfect
Its Worth It
And Love To Hear It Splash
Turn Up The Music And Use It
Chica Lets Make It Last
Even Though Your New Boyfriend
So Conceited
Me & You Both Know
He Can't Beat It Like I Can Beat It
I Know I Cheated, Mistreated
Girl Yeah I Did You Wrong
But I'ma Lay It On The Line
I Hope You Hear This Song

[Hook: Malik]

You Give Me That Certain Feeling
Like We Could Live Forever

[Verse 3: King Lil G]
Baby Tell Me That You Miss Me
I Want You To Kiss Me
Baby I Told You
I'm All About It Now
Well Actually, My Heart's Feeling Empty
Why Do I Feel Like We Changing Up
No More Time For Us To Making Up
You Ruined The Plans That I Made For Us
Don't Believe Me No More Like An Atheist
Re-Arranging Us
Made You A Part Of My Dreams
I Took You To Places You Never Seen
But You Don't Even Think About It
Forget About Me & You Don't Even Speak About It
But I Want You Back With The Candles On
Like We Did In The Summer
When I Came Back Home

[Hook: Malik]

They're Gonna Hear Us Down The Halls
(You Want That Old Thing Back)
You're Leaving Lipstick On The Walls
(We Want That Old Thing Back)
We Going On & On & On
(We've Been Waiting For So Long)
We Do It Till The Break Of Dawn
(And Then We'll Do It Again)
They're Gonna Hear Us Down The Halls
(And Then We'll Do It Again)
You're Leaving Lipstick On The Walls
Ohh, Girl Bring That Thing Next To Mine
And Dim Down The Lights
You Know Its Going Down Tonight
