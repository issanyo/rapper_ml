[Intro: Mac Dre]
("Vallejo, Cal-i-for-ni-a")
Yeah, that big Bay Area, potna
Puttin’ it down
With that Romp sound
Check this out

[Verse 1: Jay Tee]
Yeah, I be that cat comin’ cooler than most
Layin’ it down for the town, big parties we host
Up in the West Coast, left side of the map
That’s why them bitches be so sprung on the way that we rap
You see I tap that ass constantly
And treat her like the tramp that she wants to be
I break a hoe, shake a hoe, you ready or not? And leave a…
(Mac Dre: Muthafuckin’ cloud in the parking lot)
I got the front and back and side to side
And four fifteens in the back of the ride
I got the windows up but the brains is blown
And about this pimpin’ type shit I can’t leave it alone
I needs a microphone, some Tanqueray
And a down ass bitch who likes to do what I say
‘Cause in the Bay, that’s how we layin’ this
I’m probably gettin’ a little head while you playin’ this

[Chorus]
I’m from Vallejo, California where the playas dwell
Where the city and game run parallel, oh
("Vallejo, Cal-i-for-ni-a")
I’m from Vallejo, California where the playas dwell
Where the city and game run parallel, oh
("Vallejo, Cal-i-for-ni-a")

[Verse 2: Beesh a/k/a Baby Bash]
Me and the town go together like Vogues and spokes
From every ‘Stangs with thangs, Cougnuts and them candy coats
All-star man smokin’ cavi and greens
And now I’m in a coke white Caddy with rims
I got tapes and CDs that wears your jewel
I’m from the 707, cover 11 my roll
Premeditated pimp in the Westside and it’s evident
The way I spit, talk shit and stack a president
Ooh, I’m out to bend a corner or two
Gotta watch my bubble flow
And tramp hoes don’t come short
So call me fiero, I’m out hustlin’ for dinero
Gotta watch my back ‘cause playa haters packin’ heavy metal
And I can't settle for less, I need is platinum, hoe
A muthafucka in the game and I’m stackin’, hoe
It’s Baby Beesh production so it’s hella phat
And heads treat him like a throwaway gat
I’m from the town, hoe

[Chorus]
I’m from Vallejo, California where the playas dwell
Where the city and game run parallel, oh
("Vallejo, Cal-i-for-ni-a")
I’m from Vallejo, California where the playas dwell
Where the city and game run parallel, oh
("Vallejo, Cal-i-for-ni-a")

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Where I come from niggas flip tight buckets
Get tremendous beat, fresh V’s and say ‘fuck it’
The B-A-Y A-R-E-A
Where niggas smoke dank and drank all day
We words like skrilla, scratch and fetti
Give hoes pimp names like Blowjob Betty
No homies and locs, just potnas and folks
No lifts and switches, just dips and yolks
We swang ‘em in ‘Stang’ems and burn rubber sideways
Gat on the lap when we hit the highways
On Fridays, we down to hurt some cot
And we don’t get drunk, mayne, we perks a lot
We call bud dank, Bombay and roper
Don’t smoke stress ‘cause stress won’t choke ya
I hope ya, never have funk with us
‘Cause niggas from the Bay love that funky stuff
Pistols, pumps, straps and choppas
And wouldn’t hesitate or wait to straight knock ya
Head off your muthafuckin’ shoulder
I thought you knew? I know somebody told ya

[Chorus]
I’m from Vallejo, California where the playas dwell
Where the city and game run parallel, oh
("Vallejo, Cal-i-for-ni-a")
I’m from Vallejo, California where the playas dwell
Where the city and game run parallel, oh
("Vallejo, Cal-i-for-ni-a")
I’m from Vallejo, California where the playas dwell
Hoochies on the corner with they yock for sale, they hoes
(They hoes, they hoes, they hoes, they hoes, yeah)
I’m from Vallejo, California where the playas dwell
Hoochies on the corner with they yock for sale, they hoes
(They hoes, they hoes, they hoes, they hoes, yeah)

[Outro: Coolio Da’Unda’Dogg]
Check this out, for the ’96, you know what I’m sayin’?
You got C-double-O-L-I-O Da’Unda’Dogg on this microphone
With my boy Mac Dre, Jay Tee and Beesh, N2Deep
Got Extra Large in the house…
But let me tell you about this Rompalation
We puttin’ this out with my boy D-Con, you know what I’m sayin’?
If you don’t got it and you’re listening to it, you better get, ‘cause it’s the bomb
And I’m out…
