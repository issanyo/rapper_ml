[Intro: Akon] + (Baby Bash)
Oooh... Yeah
And anything that you wanna do, I'll do it
(Tell me what the word is, already) {*4X*}
Baby

[Hook: Akon]
Don't look no further
Baby I'm back (yeah)
I'm here to cater to you
Anything that you want me to, I'll do it
Cause I'll be your lover
I'll be your best, friend
Tell me what I gotta do
Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it (Do, for you)

[Baby Bash]
Now I'm back in the flesh, feelin' so blessed
Back in your corner, Suga Suga, don't stress
Forget about the rest, let's go inside
I'm back in your zone, baby, back in your vibe
Now I can't be denied, I can't lie, I'm on ya
And never, ever wanna say "Sayonara"
Somebody told me that the grass was greener
On the other side, andele, ariba
Never really intended on being a cheater
What I gotta do to be your keeper?
These words comin' out the speaker
Trill love is off the meter

[Hook]

[Baby Bash] + (Akon)
I was gone for a minute, but now I'm home
Please forgive me for being a Rolling Stone
Please forgive me, let me polish it up, like chrome
Get off the phone, tell 'em squares to leave you alone
Let me spark your interest
Now there's no more dating on the internet
Cause you already know how I get it wet
How I keep it softly and I get respect
You don't have to look no further (No)
You dealin' with the whole enchilada (Yeah)
You don't have to look no further (No)
You hotter than a fire starter (Yeah)

[Hook]

[Baby Bash] + (Akon)
I was gone for a minute (Oh) {*4X*}
Now I'm back, let me hit it (Oh) {*4X*}
