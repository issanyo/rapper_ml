(Chorus)
I changed my life so I can be with you
But you turned and walked away
Tell me what to do
I changed my life so I can be with you
But you turned and walked away
Tell me what to do
Somehow I know you still believe
Somehow I know you still believe

(First Verse)
You interrupted my bliss
Fuck this, I'm sorry
It used to be steak and fish calamari
But now all you do is drink and party
Girl you ain't the greatest the greatest was Ali
In the words of the late great Bob Marley
No Woman, no cry, yes suh I do believe
I count my blessing every time I see my loved ones
Wondering why I be stressing over a silly woman
Boy get your head straight, boy get your head right
Keep on buzzin with your cousin
Boy have a good time
Sometime I know it's right, sometimes I know it's wrong
Sometimes I do it big, sometimes I'm all alone

(Chorus)

(Second Verse)
Up and down like a see-saw
Baby let me free fall
Me fall for that again
Don't make me hee haw
Never will I get caught up again
I'ma put that on my momma and my mexican
They say money can't buy me happiness
But it will brighten my day.(brighten my day)
They say money can't buy me happiness
But it will brighten my day.(brighten my day)
Baby girl you done did it
Girl I ain't wit it
Only problem in my life was you
So good riddence
I'm out the door quick, feet first sideways
I'm checking out baby
And breathin some highway

(Chorus)

(Third Verse)
Money won't buy you happiness
But it will brighten your day
Money won't buy you happiness
But it will brighten your day
