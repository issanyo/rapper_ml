[Baby Bash]
Energy
Diggin' on your energy
Energy
Diggin' on your energy
Energy
Diggin' on your energy
Energy

[Chorus: Natalie]
Boy, I'm diggin' on your energy (Energy)
And I'm diggin' what you're tellin' me (Tellin' me)
So I wrote this little melody and dedicate
To my favorite, lover

[Chorus]

[Main Verse: Natalie]
I'm lyin' in bed
There's thoughts in my head
I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Over and over and over and over again
What can I tell you
You got me so twisted
Tossin' and turnin'
Over and over and over and over again
So I wrote a song tonight
The one you beggin' me to write
Tell me, is it cool tonight
To let you know what's on my mind

[Chorus] - 2X

[Rap Verse: Baby Bash]
Rain or shine, sleet or snow
Couldn't stop the way we flow
Welcome to my miracle, when I'm diggin' in your lyrical
Your melody's my remedy
Lemon squeeze to my Hennesey
The one I call, when I'm sippin' four'
With the candy coated Tennessey
Just make a wish, and let's make it official
For your boy Baby Bash, with some heavenly bliss
Because your kiss is my lips, girl, I'm ready to roll
Wits so vicious and bubbalicious, the energy's throwed

[Chorus] - 2X

[Bridge: Natalie]
Boy, you know that I dig you
I fell in love when I met you
I love the way, you make me feel
Your energy, is somthin' real
Boy, I love the way (Love the way)
You make me feel (You make me feel)
There's somethin' 'bout
You lovin' me
Can't do without
Your energy

[Chorus] - 2X

[Baby Bash]
Energy
Diggin' on your energy
Energy
Diggin' on your energy
Energy
Diggin' on your energy
Energy
