[Chorus:]
Always thinking of you
(Always thinking of you)
Ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh
I just wanna touch you
(I just wanna touch you)

Ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh
Anything you want to
(Anything you want to)

Ooh, uh
Ooh, ooh
I just wanna love you
(I just wanna love you)
You make me ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1:]
I'm feeling something
That I never felt before
I ain't toying you
I want you, boy

I wanna tell you things
I've been afraid to say
I want the moon now
If that's okay

If I could only get
One minute of your time
Look in your eyes
Tell you why
Should let me love you
(You should let me love you)
So deep
The way that you had me

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
I love the way
That you bring out the best of me
Just by the way you
The way you speak
So softly in my ear
You're driving me insane

Just by the way you
You say my name
It's unreal
What I feel

Is it okay?
If I still
Show you how I want you
(Show you how I want you)
I'm so amazed
With everything that you do
Boy, you make me ooh

[Repeat Chorus:]

Ooooh, ooooh
Baby
I just wanna love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooooh, ooh
Ooooh, ooh
I just gotta touch you
(Feeling you)

[Repeat Chorus:]
