Money Money Money
[Nate Dogg]
That?s my lady, she will never jack me down (Money, money, money)
That?s my baby, she?s gone always be around (Money, money, money)
She will never play me, she stray true when I leave town (Money, money, money)
That?s my playmate
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
[Baby Bash]
She?s my peso, my denero, my paper, my playmate
She?s always on time and never a day late
She?s never on a diet, my pockets they gain weight
And me without her is something I can?t take
Now we gone ride like the wind, my lover, my dividends
She my fatty, I?m her dirty and she?s my best friend
Got me spending weekends in Kingston Jamaica
Eww my favorite charge
Eww I love my paper
And when she step out of line, that he gone get on the grind
Facing penitentiary time, but she?s eventually mine
The same color as my hydro, I swear the only breezy I die for
My mind sold
In love with this cheddar
Me and her go together
Like birds of one feather
She keep me riding on leather
And chrome, you know it?s on when my baby come home
She?s my playboy bunny that?s sweeter than honeycomb

[Baby Bash]
Love at first sight
Sex on the first night
My blessing when I?m stressing, she?s keeping my game tight
She?s doing the thing right
She?s beeping compliancy
If I?m Ricky Ricardo, then she?s my Lucy
My fly serenity, my pockets is energy
As a matter of fact, she?s gone bring the Hennessy
I?d love to hold her, fold her, her love is so douja
Got them dime pieces making love to my poster
(what is it?)
I?m loving this part of the game
And my money ain't genocide I ain't got to explain
Swinging her from lane to lane
We doing the damn thing
My money, my motivation, my national campaign

[Feminine Voice & Baby Bash]
My pride, my joy, my everything (that?s what I am talking about)
I ride my boy on everything
My pride, my joy, my everything (that?s what I am talking about)
I ride my boy on everything
My pride, my joy, my everything (that?s what I am talking about)
I ride my boy on everything
