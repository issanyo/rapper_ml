[Verse 1]
Stiletto heels, dollar bill
She lookin' rockable
I'm in the building n' I'm feelin' so unstoppable
They say she's drama n' they say she's so impossible

[Chorus]
But she grabbed me by the hand and she said "vamonos"
Vamonos
She said "vamonos"
Vamonos
She grabbed me by my hand and she said "vamonos"
Vamonos
She said "vamonos"
She grabbed me by my hand and she said "vamonos"

[Verse 2]
That means she's ready to go
Ready to roll (ready to go)
