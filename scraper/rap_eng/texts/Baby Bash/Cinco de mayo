Cinco de Mayo
Feat. Frankie J

(Chorus)
I wanna kick it with you
Just party like a cinco de mayo
Just know how we do
Everybody keep staying round
You, let's party like a cinco de mayo
You know how we do
Everybody keep sellin' milo

(Verse)
Let's party like cinco de mayo
Chop it up like pico de gayo
Cause every time you see me you smile
We smokin' fuego, it's loud
We in the drop top Chevy like
Candy wet like carrie
Every day we celebrate
When we dance, my hand's on your derrier
You don't believe me, just watch me
Shots of tequila, while she dance the mariachi
Party with all our amigos
Huevos not that titos
Slayer made meseche and I'm all about my cheetos
Is she a fly mamacita, sexy noche y villa
? girl, and all that sang-sangria
Follow me, it's all to the G
Let's spend the time tonight and get a lil' freaky

(Chorus)
I wanna kick it with you
Just party like a cinco de mayo
Just know how we do
Everybody keep staying round
You, let's party like a cinco de mayo
You know how we do
Everybody keep sellin' milo
Amor y fiesta x4

(Verse)
Sippin' on Corona and lime, postin' our pictures online
Cause when they see us, they gon' wanna see us all of the time
Let's do it again, press rewind, cause baby bu you're so fine
Think baby girl you're one of a kind
So once again, it's gettin' down
And hey, hundalay, let's celebrate like a holiday
With my primos y primas, let's party all the way
Dj, let's get the flow poppin'
Dj, the music is never stoppin'

(Chorus)
I wanna kick it with you
Just party like a cinco de mayo
Just know how we do
Everybody keep staying round
You, let's party like a cinco de mayo
You know how we do
Everybody keep sellin' milo
Amor y fiesta x4

(Interlude x2)
You know it's gettin' down tonight
I can't wait for you and me to hook up
You already know it's goin' down

(Chorus)
I wanna kick it with you
Just party like a cinco de mayo
Just know how we do
Everybody keep staying round
You, let's party like a cinco de mayo
You know how we do
Everybody keep sellin' milo
Amor y fiesta x4
