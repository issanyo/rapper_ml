(First Verse IQTru)

Imas' high as Piccard glidin’ inda' night
Up all night tryna' crack da code
Sippin’ ona'  blue cold sprite sucka' free
Trusounds I stay lit high inda' ceiling
Hanging likea' chandelier High up there
Up inda' clouds Floatin' around
Four months ten bars four pounds
Talkin' myself  lookin  inda’ mirror
Hoping no one hears me down der’
Voices Echo everywhere when da room clears
The Bass Bounce off the walls oside city dogs
Little Gsʼ taggin' onda’ walls
Down for da cause dope sac in my draws
Sittin' onda' couch smoking with my dogs
Trapped  inda' lab tryna get da label on
I use to servem’ All now I just smoke ball

Stick to myself  stick to da script skip on trick

In da carribians wit' my main chick scuba puma
