Yay, yay

Pre-Verse: Powda (Frankie J. in background)
I was thinking on a weekend, we could get a little freaky
I could call some of my girlfriends (Menage a trois)
I was thinking on a weekend, we could get a little freaky
I could call some of my girlfriends (Menage a trois)

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Show me what that body do like
Wanna do, everything that you like
Your girl
Lookin' way cool
How 'bout we hook up tonight
Jacuzzi, suite hotel
Dirty movies, oh, that's swell
I'm such a freak
Oooh-la-la
Groove me with that tail
Down and dirty, rough and rugged
Dog, nasty, but you love it
She gon' kiss it, you gon' rub it
Livin' out my fantasy
Baby, come and dance for me
You got that candy cream
Let me see you pull your panty string
Let your thong slide to the side, chica, open wide
And let us do the thang, thang, baby girl
You know that's right
It's kind of vicious, though
It's kind of pimp-ish, though
This caramel coated candy cane, it's so delicious, though

Chorus: Frankie J
Show me what your body do
You can bring your girlfriend, too
We can have a rendez vous (Menage a trois)
We can have a drink or two
You can bring yo girlfriend, too
We can keep it On Tha Cool (Menage a trois)

[Verse 2: Powda]
I'm a show you what my body do
Put it on her, then put it on you
Little freaky rendez vous
Yeah, we keep it On Tha Cool
Three's company, so come with me
Got enough to make two feel lovely
He kissin' me, she rubbin' me
She lickin' me, he fuckin' me
Wanna watch you, wanna see
How me and my girlfriend get nasty
We some freaks up in that sheets
And a perfect fantasy
But you need a man with stamina
Who can take two women and handle her
Like a playa done took viagra
Workin' it until he see the sign
Powda, yeah, that nasty girl
Testin' me, I'm a rock your world
Got skills like a pro, and plus
You know I got that bomb pearl
So, boo, I'm a roll with you
Yeah, me and my homegirl, too
We gon' take it to the room
So baby, what it do

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Let me see you break your back
Baby girl, take all of that
Let me see you break your back
Uh oh, I think she swallowed that
I got the mirror on the top of my bed
And got that magmun P.I. for the top of my head (Never slip, no)

Hook 1: Baby Bash
Let's keep it all to the gravy
Me and you lovely ladies
Sippin' hypnotic
Get exotic, mayne, it feel so crazy

Repeat Hook 1

Hook 2: Frankie J
You know I like to watch
You know I like to see it
I'm kinda freaky, mama
Oh, baby, please believe it
You know I like to watch (You know I like to watch)
You know I like to see it
I'm kinda freaky, mama (You like I like to see it)
Oh, baby, please believe it

Repeat Chorus Four Times
