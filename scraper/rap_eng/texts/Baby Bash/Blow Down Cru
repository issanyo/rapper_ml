[Hook: Baby Bash]
Oooh, ooooh
Oooh, ooooh
Oooh, ooooh

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I'm feelin' good cause I'm blowin' good
In the 'lac, grippin' wood, I know you wish you could
If you was grindin' like you should then I bet you would
But you ain't grindin' like me homie so I'm lonely and I'm
Blowing on this Cali, now I'm Snoop Dogg status
Hit it to the valley with a pillow or the cavage
My patna is a grower so the dro is all credits
And the girl riding with me and I swear that she the badest
Since she blow it down too, slow it down Screw
My Mary Jane bang, [?]
It only took an hour, we just smoked a whole cube
And we 'bout to blow another in a few in my blow down cru

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
You haters don't running high, we pushing push it aside
We smoking so [?], you what's going down
Now we ain't stopping cause we about that money
We super loaded cause we smokin' oil or honey
You know, and I ain't tripping cause my shoe is tied
I got the badest bitch that money you can buy
And we swanging curb to curb and smokin' on some durb
We ain't even nervous when the popo's they be lurking
Cause my medical rec card is up to date
So they can't say shit even though they love to hate
Cause my medical rec card is up to date
So they can't say shit even though they love to hate
