Chorus: Play (slowed down)
Do it like that
Just like that
Do it, do it like that
Just like that
Do it like that
Just like that
Bounce it from the back
Let me hit it from the [{*back*}]

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
No worries, no rush, mama, take your time
Bumpin' that booty, way down that line
I'm a freak, of the week, I ain't playin' no games
When it comes to money makin', know your top notch games
She wanna add me to her life, like a MySpace friend
Cause I kill it from the [{*back*}] and keep her body shakin'
Mama Doogie like that, bubble one more time
And when you shake it, don't fake it, Beezy blow my mind

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
I just got a [{*sack*}] from my cousin Jesus
And now she way loose off the grey and the goose
And she don't play, and I don't play, I'm a put this out on blast
I update, that cupcake, boss up like Johnny Cash (Uh)
I know she tell her friends
Her friends gon' tell they friends
And when they see me, they gon' know what I'm carrying
I'm an ice cold Mexican, hell yeah, I do it Gonzo
In the back of the Escalanzo, me and her gon' do it pronto	

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Baby Bash {*slowed down*}
Short skirts and high heels
Short skirts and high heels
Short skirts and high heels
Yeah, hit it, hit the floor
Short skirts and high heels
Short skirts and high heels
Short skirts and high heels
Yeah, hit it, hit the floor
We gon' boss up, boy, we gon' boss up
We gon' boss up, boy, we gon' boss up
We gon' boss up, boy, we gon' boss up
We gon' boss up, boy, we gon' boss up

Repeat Chorus
