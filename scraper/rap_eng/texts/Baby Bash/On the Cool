Let's keep it on the cool
It's between, me and you
It's the freaky things we do
Cause baby I like it, I like it
Let's keep it on the cool
If they all letting you
The little thangs you do
Cause baby I like it, I like it
It wasn't no love at first sight, it was sex on the first night
How could it be so wrong when it felt so strong, it felt so right
I like the way you back it up, cause your chulo ain't no punk
Get it crunk, get it crunk from the back to the front, any way you want
Smoking, laughing, telling jokes, smashing riding on blades and spokes
Saying we just friends, but you and I know, what's really though
You take me on your odyssey, keep the drama off of me
You love to get on top of me, while I get you wet and watery
We sizzo and uh, we doing our thug thizzo', what your friends don't know
We'll keep it low, when talk at the club a little
When you drop em off at home, hit Beeshy on the celly
And I'll be at the telly, honey be all ready
Well now they think they know the deal, but they don't have a clue
The things we do me and you, got to keep it tight on the cool
Down low on the hush, take our time don't need to rush
You in my mind like cannabis, with a freaky way you make me bust
Freaky deaky everytime you see me, you best believe me, I'ma lick
You down with berries and cream, you lick me with that wine and kiwi
You know it's nathin', to keep that gossip off of baking
That's why we shaking, them hatas spreading information
If only I knew then what I know now, things could of been a little different
Could I have this dance, I got a girl at home already on suspicion
But I want my cake and eat it too, wanna be with her I wanna be with you
You telling me that you need it too, and let me tell you what we fin to do
Oooh wee, I love it when you freaky like that
Oooh wee, on the cool coming through from the back
Oooh wee, I love to watch you dance on my lap
Oooh wee, uh oooh wee
Oooh wee, you love to see your daddy roll up
Oooh wee, going hard and the pain rolled up
Oooh wee, that people in your business saw us
Oooh wee, oooh wee
