Paroles de la chanson Blow It In Her Face :

[Chorus:]
I'm high in the party high in the party high in the party [x2] I light it up and blow it in her face [x4]

[Cousin Fik:]

Backwood full of sticky
And it gotta be a wood yeah I'm hella picky
Tipsy pourin liquor on my kidneys
On a whole zip when I smoke I need 50
Like nuff I got grapes
Gods gift man I gotta say grace (Thank You Lord)
Your girl looking like she wanna taste
So I light it up and blow it in her face
If you keep it lit be the model
I think I'm about to move to Colorado
Or seeato I mean Seattle
Somewhere I can smoke where you niggas can't tattle
Long dreads like mac dre
No rare-o chick go that way
I'm bout to roll up a fat j
And fire up with the dj cuz

[Chorus]
[Baby Bash:]
Girl scout loud pack from a car though
Light it up lemme give her a charge though
And I better get your weathers late cornrow
Smoking shit that'll give your ass parvo
Top shelf Nigga good for your health nigga
Growing in the woods make a nigga wealth bigger
Hot head and she drop dead gorgeous
But Bad bitch on my side that I'm watchin
All night we gon post shit
Around the bay on this mothafucking ghost shit
Half a pound on a road trip and I bet we gonna blow bitch
Party buss falled out like its burning
Now that's what I call higher learning
And if the dj keep the table turning
We gonna get higher than messiah no sermon

[Chorus]
[Driyp Drop:]
It was me I did it
The purple in the air I lit it
I'm on further gone
Me and cousin smoking like cheech and chong
I'm finna blow it up its a bomb thing
Break it down roll it up I'm the fireman
You can catch it in a backwood
I was smoking on that cookie (That's Good)
Bad bitch say she wanna taste
So I light it up and blow it in her face
I was somewhere outter space
This this shit slapps this beat bang
Fucking with baby bash on them airplanes
Turnt up but I'm twisted off the hurricane
Follow everything hoes wanna jock
I be on my high ones they don't do the socks

[Chorus]
