[Baby Bash]
You go
You go
You go

[Kate Alexa]
(Verse 1)
Whenever I hear goodbyes
Remind me, baby, of you
I breakdown and cry
Next time, I'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance
Remind me, baby, of you
I took a crazy chance
Next time, I'll be true
I'll be true
I'll be true

Chorus: Kate Alexa
Footsteps on the dance floor
Remind me, baby, of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time, I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in a powder room
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune

[Baby Bash]
Sweat it out
Girl, let it out

(Verse 2)
When I'm dancing 'round
Remind me, baby, of you
I really let you down
Next time, I'll be true, yeah
I took a crazy chance
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune

Repeat Chorus

Bridge: Kate Alexa
And the music
Don't feel like it did when I
Felt it with you
Nothin' that I do or feel ever feels like I
Felt it with you

Hook: Baby Bash
Footstep
Left to right
Foot, footstep
Left to right
Foot, footstep
Left to right
Foot, footstep
Left to right

[Rap Verse: Baby Bash]
Now I can scream 'bout sanities
But it won't bring back no memories
Now you seem like a distance friend to me
And my music's how you remember me
Tellin' me, "Don't cry, again
Maybe one day, we can try again
One day, you might be mine again
But until that day, bye bye, my friend"
With the tears of a clown runnin' down your face
Dance and freedom, that's your place
It's where you belong, with style and grace
Cause now, I'm gone without a trace

[Kate Alexa]
I'm hurtin' deep inside
She cries on every tune
I breakdown and cry
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune
Yeah

Repeat Chorus
