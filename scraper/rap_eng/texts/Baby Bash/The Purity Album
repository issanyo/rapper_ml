[Verse 1: Baby Beesh]
I'ma fool
I'ma nut
I'ma nigga from the cut
Split the blunt roll it up
And the deuce is what I chunk
I'ma prosper
Spittin street gospel
Baby Beesherini maan the modern day apostle
Lacin up my boots
Maan I'm slappin on my spurs
Smokin on derb
In the Burb hittin curbs
And buy when that occurs
My music's gonna splurge
Automatic causin havoc
Cause I caused a power surge
California wit da herb
H-Town wit da lean
These million dolla words got me on the big screen
I ain't gone lie
I'm in it till I die
So muthafuck you America's apple pie!

[Chorus: Baby Beesh and SPM]
[Babby Beesh]
It's jus me and my styrofoam cup
Gone off that lean and a pocket fulla blunts
It's jus me and my styrofoam cup
[SPM]
Hoes say I'm so mean
Wit my niggas freestylin bout the same ol thing
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 2: Grimm and Russell Lee]
See I flip what I got
Turn cold to hot
Twist the knot
Turn the block
Hell I hold the spot
Drop a line
Friend of mine
Put my word on the cut
You got the time
I got the pine
Plus the syrup in the cup
Get the soda the more the merrier
Laws in the area
Steady stare at ya
Breakin the barrier
I'ma take care of ya
See
You work with me
I'll do dirt with you
We could do 2 or 3
But it be worth a few
In and out
But know we done connected the city
To the county cross state
And we break fifty fifty
Split the scene
Make the getaway clean
For the cream
Live the dream off the beam
And I love sippin lean

[Russell Lee]
You know we neva sober
Makin money sippin soda
We heavyweightas and souljas
Movin big bulldozers
You know we neva sober
Makin money sippin soda
We heavyweightas and souljas
Movin big bulldozers
It's jus me and my lean
Know what I mean
I'm on the scene
Stackin my green
I done finally accomplished my dream
I'm givin it up
Not givin a fuck
Happy P maan pass the styrofoam cup

[Chorus: Baby Beesh and SPM]
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 3: Ikeman and Lil Villain]
[Lil Villain and Ikeman]
Well I'm gone
Well I'm gone
Well I'm gone
Well I'm gone off codeine
Promethazine
[Ikeman]
Iced up bezatine
Wit a whole new team
[Lil Villain]
Candy green
Purple lean
[Ikeman]
If you know what I mean
I'm takin the 8 with the grape
I'm goin hard to all great
[Lil Villain]
I'm sippin drank from state to state
Shut em down to all break
[Ikeman]
We some Mexicans sippin drank
Lil Villain pass the dank
I'm goin hard in that thang
[Lil Villain]
That vato bout his bank
[Ikeman]
Once you make it in the game
Fuck the fame
It ain't no thang
We shut em down
We ain't playin
{Ikeman and Lil Villain]
We some South Side flippers
Codeine sippers
In the candy coated Cadi smokin Swishas

[Baby Beesh]
It's jus me and my styrofoam cup
Gone off that lean and a pocket fulla blunts
It's jus me and my styrofoam cup
[pause]

[Chorus: Baby Beesh and SPM]
[Repeat 1x]

[SPM]
Sip codeine
Hoes say I'm so mean
With my niggas freestylin bout the same ol thing
