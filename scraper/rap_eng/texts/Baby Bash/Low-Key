Get it in like the DJ do

Chorus:
Ooh Girl, you a stunna
Well Baby girl hit me on the under
Or else my lady gon' wonder
Who callin' my phone from this number
Yeah, so let's keep it low key
(I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key)
Gotta keep it low key
(I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key)
Gotta keep it low key
We gon' keep it on the low low, we ain't gotta show show
Cause we can get messy as a hobo
And it's better that they don't know
That we out doin our grown folk
Keep me warm all winter, cause it don't stop
Girl I love to get in ya
In the drop top, looking just like a winner
Hit me later on boo, maybe we can get uhhh
Yeah hook it up like a tow truck
Later on we can get it in like a slow cut
Hit a cool spot, where the people don't know us
And hit your G spot while your scratching up my shoulders

Chorus:
Ooh Girl, you a stunna
Well Baby girl hit me on the under
Or else my lady gon' wonder
Who callin' my phone from this number
Yeah, so let's keep it low key
(I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key)
Gotta keep it low key
(I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key)
Gotta keep it low key
(I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key)
Gotta keep it low key
Yeah, we gon' keep it low key
Playboy penthouse smoking on G
You know it's all on me
And I'ma make sure that you never lonely
.. girl you know you got that snap back
Make me wanna grab that, strong when I tap that
And I ain't playin' what I'm sayin
You know I gotta go but I wish that I was stayin'
Cause you be given me that A1
Top shelve love, when we both need a break from
Me and you gone, gotta shake from the main one
See me in the club with my girl, and you don't say nothin

Chorus:
Ooh Girl, you a stunna
Well Baby girl hit me on the under
Or else my lady gon' wonder
Who callin' my phone from this number
Yeah, so let's keep it low key
(I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key)
Gotta keep it low key
(I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key)
Gotta keep it low key
(I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key, I'ma keep it low key)
Gotta keep it low key
Girl I wish that I could stay the whole night
Wake my ass with you by my side
But you know I gotta catch that flight
So until the next time, girl I hope you're alright
La la la la, la la la
La la la la
Let's keep it low key

Chorus:
Ooh Girl, you a stunna
Well Baby girl hit me on the under
Or else my lady gon' wonder
Who callin' my phone from this number
