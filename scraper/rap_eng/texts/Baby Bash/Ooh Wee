Hook: Baby Bash & Grimm
I know
You find it hard to believe that
I am
The genie of your lamp and
I can
Do anything you wish, but
Right now
I'm commanding you to jam
Oooh wee

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Scooby dooby, player
Pass it to me
Sticky icky ooohwee gooey, I'm straight
Out the boonies
Bang Screwy in my Dully, fingers
Residuey
My girl wants a purse, so I bought the bitch a Louie
Got killers that are puny, sick and rather loony
Baby Beesh, Happy P, and my little primo Goofy
I'm the bully with the fully, automatic uzi
My jacuzzi full of floozies, making dirty movies
Feed the needy with my CD, on T.V. in Tahiti
Wake up in the morn and stretch, and smoke me weedies
I used to be the poorest
Ask Mark Flores
Now I drive around in a brand new Delores

Chorus:
[Bash & Grimm] Oooh wee
[SPM] We gon' do them bad for sure
[Bash & Grimm] Oooh wee
[SPM] Baby girl, I thought you know
[Bash & Grimm] Oooh wee
[SPM] We gon' get throwed and blowed
[Bash & Grimm] Oooh wee
[SPM] Paint the town like Michealangelo
[Bash & Grimm] Oooh wee
[SPM] Daddy bought a brand new car
[Bash & Grimm] Oooh wee
[SPM] Now momma get to shine like a star
[Bash & Grimm] Oooh wee
[SPM] Daddy gon' ball til he fall
[Bash & Grimm] Oooh wee
[SPM] Now momma get to shop at the mall
[Baby Bash] Oooh wee

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Ay chihuahua, holla
On the dollar
Mama
Shake your nalgas and smoke
With Ali Babba
Got that goo goo and that gaga, you
Can call me dada
In the Cadi' or the Navi, skatin' Daytons on Impalas
Just like Michael Jackson, I go Thriller for scrilla
Pushing green pearl and vanilla
Hand, on my nine milli
Baby Bash and SPM, we don't like no cops
We fin to turn that Dope House into Microsoft
Well, there he go again, with that flow again
Actin' like he know again
Blow it up like Nickelodeon, clean it up like a custodian
"You sure that's him?"
"Yeah, that's Bash
Gone off dodo mixed with hash
He's the one police harass, he's your future and your past"

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
Bought my own limousine, 20 inch McLeans
Five screens, with two Margarita machines
High beams, I mean, ballin' since nineteen
And I still ain't finished countin' all my green
A born loser, microphone abuser
Puffin' on medusa at the Lollapalooza
If you introduce her, I bet I'm gonna goose her
I've never been a snoozer, I'm a 600 Cruiser
Comin' out of Houston with a mouth full of pollution
Mom wants to put me in another institution
I smoke a whole quarter, but I've never been a snorter
Your boy SPM, I done swam across the border
Ha ha (Ha ha...)

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus
