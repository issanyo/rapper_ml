[SPM] Uh, uh
I ain't got the last two sentences to this verse
[Grimm] Then just freestyle it
[SPM] Alright, I can do that

[South Park Mexican]
(Verse 1)
Bring it back
Drop the top on the 'Llac
Screw, put the tap on the wet Fat Pat
Got the black gat
Can't come wack
'Member when clubs wouldn't let me rap
Now they call me up
All on nuts
Get 'em for about ten thousand bucks
Sippin' on Dom Perigion
Five, six songs, and my ass is gone
Later on, catch a tone
Grab my phone
See if my boy Baby Bash is home
From San Anton' to the Astrodome
Smoke weed with Cheech
And hash with Chong
2 A.M., sunglasses on
"Twice Last Night," that's my nastiest song
Now it's on
Ask my T. Jones
Seem like the whole world on my ding-dong

Chorus 1:
[Bash] Take two hits and pass it on to you
[SPM] Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do
[Bash] Fill my swimmin' pool up with some brew
[SPM] Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do

(Verse 2)
Well I'm
SP Mex in the place to be
And I went to Bedrock University
I hang with the poor, and steal from the rich
I chill with the real, and I won't never switch
Jump out the bed
Come from the head
Last name Flintstone, first name Fred
My low-low
Hop like a pogo
Walkin' down the
Yellow brick road with a dog named Toto
Run from no one cause I might get a cramp
Ten dollar stone for a twenty food stamp
Money ain't happiness, y'all some fools
Your baby's brown eyes in some diamonds and jewels

Chorus 2:
[Bash] Smokin', chokin' on PePe LePew
[SPM] What ya say, dawg
Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do
And you know it, don't know it, don't quit
[Bash] Make a dollar bill turn into two
[SPM] H-Town, H-Town
Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do

(Verse 3)
You wanna play with the S, hun
Twenty-five on my dresser
White tank-top
Dickie's from fiesta
Slow and low
There we go
Doin' the impossible
Jam rock and roll
That's how it'd go
I done lost my high a little while ago
Put away your gun
Have some fun
Not no star, but I'm stabbin' one
A stallion
Saddle up the horses
My gal gorgeous
I bought a fortress
Two divorces and only lost a Corvette
My third wife
Still ain't born yet
No sweat
I relax in Houston
I'm the one that went gold
With no distribution
Grindin'
Now them hoes mine and
Your boy went from motherfuckin' dimes to diamonds

Chorus 3:
[Bash] Drop my top and pick up DJ Screw
[SPM] Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do
[Bash] Show my love, I'll show it back to you
[SPM] Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do
[Bash] Tell your kid to stay his ace in school
[SPM] Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do
[Bash] Step on stage and act just like a fool
[SPM] Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do
[Bash] Make my girl sneak in my .22
[SPM] Put this in your purse
Yeah, that sounds like somethin' I would do
[Bash] Say homeboy, you stepped in doggy doo
Go outside and please wash off your shoe

[South Park Mexican]
Say Grimm, roll another baby dick
Let's get high, baby, fa' sho
{*South Park Mexican & Grimm laughing*}
