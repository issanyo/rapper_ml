[Paula DeAnda]
As days go by

Chorus: Paula DeAnda
I'm missin'
You, baby
Patient
Waiting
For you
To hold you
To thrill you
To fill you
With tender
Kisses
Give you the love you've been missin'
Oh, I can't wait til you come back home
To have you all alone (As days go by)

Repeat Chorus

[Baby Bash (Paula DeAnda in background)]
(Verse 1)
Now I done came a long way, but ain't, too far
And hope, this love letter don't leave, a big scar
So baby, just hold on, and mama, just be strong
Cause no one
Knew the war would last for so long
The rockets, the red glare, the bombs up in the air
I'm just, doin' my duty, but missin' it right there
So as days go by, I'm coutin'
Every minute
Wishin'
I was home, for sure
With you in it
But the soldiers that I'm runnin' with are ready to blitz
This ain't no video
This is just as real as it gets
I made some life long friends, holdin' down the front line
And girl, I can't wait to get back in your sunshine

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Now as days go by, my time was spent reflectin'
On all the little things, you said, I was neglectin'
They say
You never know what you have until it's gone
Didn't know back then, but I will, from now on
When I try to channel out, all the fear and the stress
I picture me and you, rollin', lookin' dressed to impressed
Sendin' notes
You'll be there, when I'm back from Iraq
If you're good, to have a real chica, havin' my back

Hook 1: Baby Bash
Give everybody hugs and tell 'em, "I really miss 'em
Man, your boy be back, when I'm through with my mission"
Give everybody hugs and tell 'em, "I really miss 'em
Man, your boy be back, when I'm through with my mission"

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Paula DeAnda]
To have you all alone
As days go by
As days go by

Hook 2: Baby Bash (Paula DeAnda)
One day
We gon' get it together
One day
We gon' get it together (As days go by)

Repeat Hook 2
