[Rasheed]
I wake up early to the sticky green on the indonesia
Give back to the day, the puff, the pint, all at my leisure
Pleasure and pain, give and take it's all the same
So many rotten forgotten up in this dirty game
I flip a solo to scope to your open pupils
Stated neutral, weeded up from the indo strupals
They bust they pistols at my click but they miss
So being that this is ghetto treason, g's up in this hatin season
Through all this anonmosity I keep it playalistic
Lay your balistic, how to make it and I get it twisted
You repo what you sold, but if you keep it low pro
No pis-tol, you bound to gain the heat bro
Apropriate buisness, associates is a must
Just don't get stuck in the dust, and never have no trust
Lust them, never love a hoe, leave em when they pay
Looks can be decieving, please believe everything I say

[Chorus x2]
Gotta get your game and paper right
The Mac God yo
Stay on your toes all day and night
And then he said
And never ever love a hoe
The Mac God yo
Watch for the state and the federal
And then he said

[Baby Beesh]
Well I woke up with tears in my eyes
I knew I was finna be player baptised
He led me to the path blessing me with holy water
Then he introduced me to his fluffy green daughter
Her name was Mary Jane, very same girl I met when I was ten
But I never let her in cuz I wasn't ready then
But now your boy's a player prophet
Mac God you been so gracious
You tightened up my laces then you dealt me those four aces

[South Park Mexican]
It was all crystal clear like vodka
I knew she was my girl since then first day I robbed her
Eighty seven elbows, sell those, share holds like Melrose
Cell phones be ringing in my stingin, who the hell knows
Bring those pop, shoo-be-do-wop like hot lead
Cuz I'm a pothead, I'll quit when I drop dead
Pop said I ran him out the crib when I was three
I been a g since the third day that me eyes began to see

[Chorus x2]

[Rasheed]
Livin life in the world of a pirahna
Goin through drama with baby mama
Keepin a player persona, listenin to them old timers
Criminal grimer, cervesa ain't as good as bomber
Hey no need to rush young g, go ahead and take a comma
You gots to whirl up in your hands with some marijuana
Don't worry bout mama, just keep your focus on your dollars
Don't be so quick to judge what we do
Cuz everyday them haters are just waitin to hit you
And I won't even mention you gots the killers on a regular basis
Smiling faces, at the same time ploting on giving you cases
You wanna roll through there all with your lady
But regardless you still gotta raise the babies
And I'ma be the first one to tell you not to love these hoes
But love your mama, and the though Lord knows
And actually women be hounding me from state to state
Guess thats part of the being platinum player paid

[Chorus x2]
