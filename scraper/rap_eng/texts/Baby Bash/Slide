Slide over
Mami let me get in your ear
Let me sprinkle you with some of this here
You's a cutie pie butterfly
I just wanna see you smile
Slide over
Yeah
You should resist a bit of your time
Soak it up let it get in your mind
Cause I’m so really feeling you I'm so really digging you
I’m so just

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Slide across the leather let me feel your body heat
Let me get you in the mood while you’re turning up the beat
Speakers bumping loud vibrating down the street
You ain’t no average girl so you need someone unique
Scrape-Srcaping down the block in a cady whipping new shoes
All up in my ear telling me what she gon do
And she all on my cologne like some cat scratch fever
Telling me no mami's gonna match that either
Hate-Haters might chatter but we really ain't trippin though
Long as me and you baby boo know it’s really though
Haters might chatter but we really ain't trippin though
Long as me and you baby boo know it’s really though

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Now you as hot as heat of Summer girl but cold as the snow
That’s right but anything's possible but nothing's for sure
Your smile's worth a million bucks and girl I'm feeling your flow
I can’t lie, I’m so addicted to your beautiful glow
Let me find out your love going to Vegas
First class flights, five-star accommodations
And we can get our money on and I’ma love you long
Give you the key to mi corazon turn your house into a home
Then hit the galleria, go out for Margaritas
Rock star sweet desire for the non-believers
Off Top, let’s thicken the whole plot
The question ain’t why, baby boo, it's why not

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I just want you close to me
‘Cause this, this is where you supposed to be
So, just

[Hook]
