[Intro:]
The adventures of that Scoop Deville
The adventures of that Scoop Deville
Scoop! Why these tracks so danky?
Why my tree so stinky?
Why the foot come out close to'
With that thick bitch not too lanky!
Why the hell she wanna thank me
When we do that hanky panky?
Cause she know it's real and I'
Some of these .. just can't believe
Let me introduce game one on one
When it comes to getting saucy
Bow Wow still' the boss
Still the PU you just so bossy!
Get that solid dope, nigga say it's not
Showing out in the parking lot
That you got your helmet missing
Yeah, I ' cause I drop top a lot!
Chop a block, chop a slayer
Toss the keys of that valley
Fuck VIP, we're owners, nigga
Smoking on some of that Cally!
I got that dress code in force
But not for me and my chica
Ball caps and all that
Waitress from Costa Rica!

Hook: (x2)
You know I'm pulling up in some way
We're on the way!
I got the sip, I got the zip
Now tell me who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
Let's get faded
Forty ounces, I'm jazzing
Took a sip, while we're waiting
For the night to fall and we're blazing
Got the cookies going in the back
Right now ' new plates intact
Got the whip murdered out'
Get under bottom
And everything on that bitch'
Got her moaning like, uh, uh
Snow-white can't mug
Like how the fuck?
Must have been love!
I'm like aha! I hustle tough
I've been slaying tapes since the waking, babe
Better know that I paid my dues
I am a ' I ain't have to hold
To go toe to toe with these dudes!
Look, I'm Cally made and I'm Texas pray
Mexicana on point!
I'm working days, and I'm working late
So at night better pass that joint!
Young chick hanging with the voice
So we're popping bottles and sipping
I'm making money with OGs
And I ain't got no time for these bitches!

Hook: (x2)
You know I'm pulling up in some way
We're on the way!
I got the sip, I got the zip
Now tell me who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
Here come the dolo
Here come the dolo
Here come the dolo
Here come the dolo
Bow Wow!
Here come the dolo
I pull up with a bag of California finest hay
Got swishers sweet, got see in Vegas
And backwards I don't play!
I get high every day
Gotta get in there and get it every way
My cop cold, my neck froze
My drink muddy as a Martin made
Let me know if you're down the blaze
Got satellite Kush rolled up for days!
People gonna find that's minimal wage
Blow a few P in a couple of days
AP, 28 to' I'mma run that back in a couple of plays
Don't read me wrong, I'm on a different page
If you wanna get high, I got a couple of ways
Cause you're still behind in a couple of days
Don't plan on coming down, coming down
Super ' like .. standing high on that mountain
If you're down with the get down
Then go get down when I pass that thing round
When I pass by, get double ...
Cause I'm smelling like a pawn
Getting faded, if you're down the roll
Let me know, got smoke on deck
Got a two in a big blue
You can have money if you're working on that'
That new weed, how you're feeling good
You love that Kush' get tripping!
I'm gonna go and get that check
Pulling that, get that, I'mma get my mind correct

Hook: (x2)
You know I'm pulling up in some way
We're on the way!
I got the sip, I got the zip
Now tell me who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
Let me know who wanna blaze!
