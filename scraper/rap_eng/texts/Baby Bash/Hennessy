[Intro: Miami the Most]
Yeah
You done brought your bath-water-less body parts
Your ugly bitch
But you ain't brought no Hennessy, man
And when you did bring the Hennessy
It was the one with pork in it
We don't drink pork, bitch
Privilege Heem a pop
[Mac Dre] But did you bring that Hennessy
[Miami] But did you bring that Hennessy
[Mac Dre] But did you bring that Hennessy
[Both] But did you bring that Hennessy

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I met mamacita in a taqueria
Half Selena, half Aaliyah
Mixed little thang with a sexy little swing
Got on the dame like Ichabod Crane
Started spittin' game, mayne, I got words
Rap your ear off til I get on your nerves
I'll say somethin' a notch never heard
Like, "I'm fly as the wings on a hummingbird"
What you runnin' for, girl? I don't bite
Let the game hit a bitch; chicks, I don't fight
I don't got all night, get ya thing together
Tell your guy "bye"; get some brain together
I mean, it's whatever, I don't see no limits
To be the biggest thing since the fall of the Nimitz
Get yards like Emmitt from here to Tennessee
And oh yeah, baby, bring that Hennessy

[Chorus 2X: Mac Dre + (Miami the Most)]
I brought that hoe, slim chicks and bad hoes
And Backwood blunts for the tobacco
(But did you bring that Hennessy?)
Three kegs, freaks that give head
Treats and beach beats, petites and big legs
(But did you bring that Hennessy?)

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
I got a master plan, I got some hash in hand
Comin' straight from a coffee shop in Amsterdam
And I don't give a fuck, somebody split the blunts
My currency like some surgery, it's Nip and Tuck
Mr. Ed gettin' head in the back of the S-U
I'm a bring my cousin, but I'm shakin' my nephew
And you can even ask my agent
He gon' tell you this, "Ronnie Rey's impatient
And he's so flagrant, ready for liftoff
Yeah, you know they love it when he's dustin' his kicks off"
Mayne, I'm higher than a fire escape, I got the munchies
With seventeen topless models from different countries
And don't let me start to vaporizin'
And thrust me a chick on the horizon
She swear she love the way I'm grindin'
That Privilege Heem is tantalizin'

[Chorus 2X: Mac Dre]
I brought that hoe, slim chicks and bad hoes
And Backwood blunts for the tobacco
(But did you bring that Hennessy?)
Three kegs, freaks that give head
Treats and beach beats, petites and big legs
(But did you bring that Hennessy?)

[Verse 3: Jay Tee]
Now when I walked out the cab, I jumped in my Caddy
And told my mayne hutch, "Hoe, get at me"
I stepped on the gas, let off the break
I'm in the V-Town, playboy, there's money to make
I hit the liquor store and cop a fifth
I seen Cadillac Ronnie and Andre Hicks
There ain't nothin' but real bad broads all over
Tryin' to get me to come and park the Rover
Stepped out the load in my Oakland Raider
Black Kangol, grey alligator
Stuntin' like, a million bills
I asked baby, "Has she ever stacked scrill in heels"
'Cause if she wanna, hit the corner, we can take over California
Don't trip, I'm born to mack
Half tank of grey, half cognac

[Chorus 2X: Mac Dre]
I brought that hoe, slim chicks and bad hoes
And Backwood blunts for the tobacco
(But did you bring that Hennessy?)
Three kegs, freaks that give head
Treats and beach beats, petites and big legs
(But did you bring that Hennessy?)

[Outro: Miami the Most]
Man, I'd rather you bring the Heem
Than your funky ass, your ugly bitch
Your bad karma, or your broke ass mama
And we gon' bring the Hennessy
And not the one with pork in it
And this is MigElegante
And I'm out
Yahtzee!
