[MC Magic]
Come on

Chorus: Nichole
I will give you all I have
Everything
Cause what we have is very special
So special
All my nights and all my days
Spend with you cause you're so special
So special

(Verse 1)
(MC Magic in background) {Biggie in background}
[MC Magic] I'm sittin' V.I.P. with my homeboy Biggie {What's up}
Lookin'
Across the club, it's kind of dark, but I can still see
This shorty
Stepped in the room, lookin' super fly
Since I'm that super guy
I'm tryin' to make you mine
She got them apple bottoms
She got that juicy top
She got them sexy bubbles
And I'm tryin' to make it pop
[Biggie]   So won't you tell me little mama what you think
I gotta do (What you think, girl)
To make you mine (Uh)
[MC Magic] To make you mine, baby girl, that's my mission
[Biggie]   Come on
[MC Magic] Several positions, we don't need no intermission
[Biggie]   No intermission
You got me wishin'
[MC Magic] I told you girl, you and I, we'll make it special, tonight

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Baby Bash] If I told you once, then I told you twice
You that spice, in my life
Hold it down, when I come around
Cause you know how much I sacrifice
But it ain't no mystery
Whenever we're together, it's a victory
And you know I could never get sick of thee
Baby girl, just check our history
And you know
I'm in the ki
And I made my choice
Keep your [{*na na*}] wet and moist
When I wake up in the morn', stretch and yawn
First thang I wanna do is hear your voice
[Female]    Good morning, daddy
[Baby Bash] That's the way
You bless my angel everyday
I'm the luckiest Mexican, in the state
Cause you got my back, and we're here to stay
And we both right where we belong
So happy in our comfort zone
I'm never gonna leave your heart alone
And that's my word, til you know it's on

Refrain: Baby Bash
And that's the truth, high as the roof
Girl, your love is hundred proof

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Chorus
