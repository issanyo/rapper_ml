[Baby Bash]
Baby Bash
Mickael
Oh boy
What is it

[Chorus: Mickael]
Your body's like a rollercoaster
My favorite attraction
Let me get closer
You the drug I got addicted
This time I'm pleading guilty
I know I'll be convicted
I lose the sense of gravity
When you start moving on me
We're on the same orbit
You know that I love it
I was poisoned, you the remedy
When you're kissing over me
Baby what'd you do to me

(Verse 1)
Laughin', smilin', tellin' jokes
Is how we does our thang
Take me for that ride, let your boy inside
Let me bring you pleasure/pain
Is it just a game, No Way Jose
Bust about you all night, all day
I'm a ride you like I ride that way
Let me keep you hotter than a microwave (Hey)

[Hook: Baby Bash]
And it just don't stop
We bubblin' til we pop
It's good to the last drop
I'm loving that oooh-wop

[Hook]

[Chorus]

(Verse 2)
I'm a kick it, I'm a stick it, I'm a love it, I'm a lick it
I'm a tighten up these curves
When I ram it, I'm a rip it, she gone love it, when I give it
I give mines and she gives hers
Watch out
I'm on a rollercoaster ride tonight
And I bet she didn't know
She's gonna be my bride tonight
On Tha Cool though
I love your culo
And the way you treat your papi chulo
Wanna let your crew know
How you gets down with that numero one
Cotton-candy carousel
Disneyland or fairy tale
How you put a playboy in a merry spell
Cause you twerk that thang, mama very swell (Ugh)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mickael]
Flirting with your skin
We can't stop kissing
We can't stop touching
Overload of loving
Baby, where you've been
Cause I been waiting
Everyday searching
For the one I was missing
Now that I have you
I won't let you go
You'll stay close to me
Cause I need you so
You will never be, far away from me
I would get crazy, and would miss you so

[Chorus] - 2X
