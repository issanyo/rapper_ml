[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
Hold up, let's get it right
I ain't got no kryptonite
But I bet, I'll spit a grip tonight
Let's dip and hit the strip tonight
We only live once and we ain't pushin' up daisies
Nena, ven aqui, put your cape on and save me
She say, "Show me where your body hurts"
Fresh from Bath & Body Works
She smells so good and eatible
Her super love's incredible
Them super villains gon' hate it
Cause they love is overrated
Misery loves company, so I guess 'em motivated

Pre-Chorus:
[Baby Bash]    Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Her love is super strong, that'll never ever change
[Paula DeAnda] No-oh-oh (No-oh-oh)
Ne-ne-ah (Ne-ne-ah)
Ne-ne-never

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Pre-Verse Twice

(Verse 2)
Let's swang and bang in the diamond lane
Get paid off this rhymin' thang
Candy coated, finer thangs
I keep my heina shinin', mayne
I'm lookin' for my super chick
She ridin' 'round in my super whip
Super tight and super thick
The homie with that super grill

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

Super friend in
