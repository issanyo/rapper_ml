Out with the old girl
In with the new
Tastes so good, lemme get me a spoon
31 flavors, i'm pimpin' withchu
And girl I got the munchies, so i'm stickin' withchu

Cinnamin spice up in my life, maybe one day you can be my wife (x2)

I can't wait, I got a date manana
And my girl got a platinum allah?
She smell like Shaqel with her cucumber melon
And her fashion is dipped in Prada Prada

I got a boss one on my team
Every playa boy matches dream
And she thicker than the sticker on my winter go-getter 'cause she break me off that candy cream

She's so yummy yummy yummy
Ohh she's sweet as honey
Ohh I gotta get some na na, na na
She's so yummy and delicious
Ohh with tender kisses
Ohh I gotta get some na na, na na

Some na na (na na na)
Some na na (na na na)
Some na na (na na na)
Some na na (na na na)

She got a stack full of cakes
And a million dollar waist
When she slid up on my chrome
She said it's true ronny ray
You as cool as a shade
I said ya what's goin on
Thats when the na na got weird
And we started the perc
Gettin high as a fire escape
She said I heard from a bird bout the way you get down
And now i'm ready with a video tape

I guess it was my destiny
To hit that juicy recipe
Call a man who did ectasy
With a whole lotta freaky energy
Sweet azuca on my mind
With a top notch breezie on my line
I get a cavity girl every time
I go down low where the sun don't shine

She's so yummy yummy yummy
Ohh she's sweet as honey
Ohh I gotta get some na na, na na
She's so yummy and delicious
Ohh with tender kisses
Ohh I gotta get some na na, na na

Some na na (na na na)
Some na na (na na na)
Some na na (na na na)
Some na na (na na na)
Na nananana

She's so yummy yummy yummy
Ohh she's sweet as honey
Ohh I gotta get some na na, na na
She's so yummy and delicious
Ohh with tender kisses
Ohh I gotta get some na na, na na

Some na na (na na na)
Some na na (na na na)
