I'm a holla back when I pop my collar back
Girl I see that dunka dun dunk I want all of dat
Follow dat train mane follow that caboosie
Ain't nothin in the world like some thick and some juicy
She goin downtown 'cause her favorite DJ's spinnin
I'm all up in the door so I'm already winnin
I got a lotta women but I'm way too choosy
And man I love my cake like that Ricky love Lucy
On some peanutbutter leather with the wood so grainy
It must be rainin dollars 'cause she's lookin so gravy
Sophisticated lady poppin till the end what it do what it is
Baby girl tell me what's happenin what's happenin
[Sean Kingston:]
Lemme see ya go mama go mamma
Get your girls and put on a show mama
Get it on the floor dip it low mama
[Baby Bash:]
She move like she dancing on youtube
The kinda chica that you really ain't used to
Dame lo dame lo momma shoot through
In my ear talkin bout I'm a do you
Everyone top notchin, everybody watchin
Ain't no punk when she pop lock and drop it
Straight show stoppin watchin me perform
Got the cyclone ringtone on the phone
I'm feelin on my body baby girl I'm in the zone
Must be the goose mixed with a lil trone
She make it happin cappin feelin on me
We in the bentley and we feelin like yeee
[Sean Kingston:]
Lemme see ya go mama go mamma
Get your girls and put on a show mama
Get it on the floor dip it low mama
