Sexy Eyes, they're so lovely
Sexy Eyes Make me wanna love ya
Sexy Eyes
Girl you're lookin' way cool tonight Oohh
Da da da da da
Ya know I got the cognac
Da da da da da
And the phat bomb sack
Da da da da da
Your sexy eyes got me hypnotized
Lady come and take a ride with me

Shorty do you know the time
All I wanna do is vibe
Put you on the suga rise
Smilin' wit your pearly whites
Sexy eyes
Sexy waist
Sexy each and every day
When I put this thang up on ya
Sexy mama wanna marry me
But hold up now, we just met
Let me see how long you keep it wet
Hold it steady, already
Baby girl we done did dat
It's like a stairway to paradise
When I look into your eyes
Mama very nice
And we can do all type of thangs
Rollin in them whips and I like to swang
You know it's nathan to a trildo
Your sexy eyes are so spiritual

(Chorus x1)
The steelos so kamikaze
Shrinin' like Liberachi
Smellin' like Burberry
Me Issey Miyaki
It's goin' down like gravity
Yo baby daddy mad at me
And I throw these things so handley
Cop me an assault and battery
She still wanna love me like a playboy bunny
Lookin' like warm hunny
So classy and stunning
Faithfully, she waits for me
Like the real ones really do
So gracefully she's made for me
And you know that's on the cool
Girl get your shine on like candle in the wind
Gotta keep my mind strong
When I'm hammerin' the fin
And one look is all it took
Incredible thighs
And one look is all it took
Incredible eyes

(Chorus x1)
(x2)
Time don't wait for love
And life don't wait for a break in the weather
It's time for me and you to hook up
Let's get this thing together

(Chorus x2)
