Baby Bash, Mikael
What is it?

Your body's like a rollercoaster
My favorite attraction let me get closer
You're the drug I got addicted
This time I'm pleading guilty
I know I'll be convicted

I lose the sense of gravity
When you start moving on me
We're on the same orbit
You know that I love it
I was poisoned You're the remedy
When you're kissing over me
Baby what d'you do to me

Laughing, smiling telling jokes is how we does our thang
Take me for that ride, let your boy inside let me bring you pleasure-pain
Is it just a game No Way Jose bust about you all night and day
I'm a ride you like I ride that wave let me keep you hotter then a microwave
And it just don't stop, we bubbuling till we pop, it's good to the last drop, I'm loving that woopwop!
And it just don't stop, we bubbuling till we pop, it's good to the last drop, I'm loving that woopwop!

Flirting with your skin
We can't stop kissing, we can't stop touching
Overload of loving
Baby where've you been, cause I've been waiting
Everyday searching for the one I was missing
Now that I have you, I won't let you go
You'll stay close to me cause I need you so
You will never be, far away from me
I would get crazy, and would miss you so
