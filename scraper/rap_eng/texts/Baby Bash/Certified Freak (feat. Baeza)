She ain't even gotta speak, I can see it on her face
She a certified freak
It only took me bout a week, got her in between the sheets
She a certified freak

Head so good I got my eyes closed
I'm a go raw and let the dice roll
35 hunned for the smoke bag, 2 for the go
Yeah I'm still blowing old cash
I'm prolly in the old school, weed lit
Candy paint on the chrome shoes
12 packs, 35 stacks, mix xan with the gin
That's why I didn't call back
Strong pack, city in my ball cap
30 round drummer, make a hater wanna fall back
Boss shit, me I let my bread talk
Fed hot, they want me in the cell locked
2 bitches on my dick, yeah I love freaks
Bitches cash out just to fuck me
And she ain't even gotta speak
I layed her on the couch and I beat
She a certified freak

She ain't even gotta speak, I can see it on her face
She a certified freak
It only took me bout a week, got her in between the sheets
She a certified freak

Rollin up cookie, pouring up sysurrp
Bad yellow bitch with my hand up her skizzirt
Let my seat back and the hoe gonna slizzerp
She do it too good, I can't be a fizzers
Do it so good I'm a put that chick to work
Put her in the strip club, let the bitch twerk
The money ain't straight then she gonna get hurt
I won't save no hoe, I ain't no church
Juicy j pimping shit that's all a nigga know
Weed be so loud that's all a nigga smoke
No rehab for me all I need is dope
She ain't giving up the head, you can keep the hoe
Keep the hoe, keep the hoe
She ain't giving up the head, you can keep the hoe
Keep the hoe, keep the hoe, keep the hoe
She ain't giving up the head, you can keep the hoe

She ain't even gotta speak, I can see it on her face
She a certified freak
It only took me bout a week, got her in between the sheets
She a certified freak

Ah, I pull my socks up and made some popcorn
Tryina sauce on your chicken in a hot sauce
She dancing like she wanna have a nigga baby
Word to my nigga berner told the bitch you mainy
It's only one reason for this phone call
Turn some pitbull on an she get lockjaw
I'm on some taylor shit, kicks with the gator prints
Say you getting all this money nigga what you make of it?
I'm balling like a motherfucker, Dennis Rodman
She on her 9 to 5 and that's on her job
Tilt your head back, take a shot a this
I'm on my 6 man, like I'm off the bench
Why the club going dumb that's you baby father?
Tell him I'm just tryina function, word to 40water
All these bottles in this bitch you's a wanna be
But let me get back to a shawty going front of me, hey, hey
