She got a caramel, round, round, brown
Make me go crazy when she come around
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth
When she got them skinny jeans, body down low
She's my baby candy, had to let her know
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Yeah, you crossin' out yo label, girl, you bustin' all night
Not a top notch top rank or top flight
But it ain't a butta finga or it ain't a babe ruth
Got ya dancin' way loose like you off the gray goose
Caramel dummy's on my mind on the frappachino
Betty crocker dunkin' hines taste like rios
Her body so Cleo colder then Alaska
Break me off slow she gone break me off fast
And you know she broke me off from the south to the north
East to the west, baby, do it so soft
Got me singin' boy, yoy, boy, yoy
She got that goody gum drop, oh boy
She got a caramel, round, round, brown
Make me go crazy when she come around
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth
When she got them skinny jeans, body down low
She's my baby candy, had to let her know
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth, sweet tooth
Let's feelin' tastes great, that's my thang
Honey buns dum dums coconut cream
Cut her up clean 'cause she sweeter then my swisha
I give her cap a key everytimes I get wit her
She's my cover girl, lover girl, sweet as Amaretto
Lookin' so vicious when she do it in stilettos
Hip hop or heavy metal, she workin' that Jello
And she love to bring it home and help me count my spinedo
Kisses for my lady cadyver
I ain't got a square, I gots me a ryder
Put her on the flyer, betcha club jump off right
Guarantee she gone, keep it bumpin' all night
She got a caramel, round, round, brown
Make me go crazy when she come around
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth
When she got them skinny jeans, body down low
She's my baby candy, had to let her know
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth, sweet tooth
You're my top notch, lady make the club go crazy
Let me see ya goody, goody gum drop
Thicka then a snicka with her body off the liquor
Let me see ya goody, goody gum drop
If you're sexy and you know it and you're not afraid to show it
Let me see ya goody, goody gum drop
And get your frame off the chain', make ya say mane
Let me see ya goody, goody gum drop
She got a caramel, round, round, brown
Make me go crazy when she come around
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth
When she got them skinny jeans, body down low
She's my baby candy, had to let her know
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I got a sweet tooth
Baby is my buttakup, oh, I, oh, I got a sweet tooth, sweet tooth
