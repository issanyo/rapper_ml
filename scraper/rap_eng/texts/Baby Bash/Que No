Uh

Yeah

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
I'm off that grand daddy purple with my cousin Chingo
We in the buildin' and we lookin' for something to mingle
Preferably single and maybe bilingual
An all-star cast like a movie called Primos
Best believe, it's comin' out
You gon' see us comin' out
Sockin' haters in they grill, used to shine, ain't comin' out
Shot a flick, overseas
Brought back, hella trees
Chief a-real big, humongous, I play a melody

Chorus: Chingo Bling
It don't matter what you got, it's what you do with it
It don't matter what you got, it's what you do with it
It don't matter what you got, it's what you do with it
But if you workin' with somethin'
Come through with it
She's a bad mama-yama, que no?
Yeah
She's a bad mama-yama, que no?
Yeah
She's a bad mama-yama, que no?
Yeah
Now take her all over the floor

Hook: Chingo Bling
Pop that taco, pop, pop that taco
Pop that taco, pop, pop that taco
Pop that taco, pop, pop that taco
Pop it
Pop it all over the floor
Yeah

[Verse 2: Chingo Bling]
Big breast, she was rockin' pink sweats
Paid to get laid, this ain't no cheap sex
Now I'm seein' more paper than pinche ink jets
What's next, hairy hoe
Call her Chubacka
Nipples was piereced, she had the door knocker
She was playin' with balls, ain't talkin' 'bout soccer
I'm Chingo Bling, and I don't give a bird turd
Her momma trippin' cause my first name a curse word
Hey Deloris
Show me your clitoris
Gave me big head in the back of a Ford Taurus
And her pannies was red, but her bra was orange
Girl, get your wax on and shave that forest

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Jay Tee]
I'm in H-Town, Texas, doin' it grande
With Chingo and Bash is probably where you gon' me
I'm taco truck pimpin' cause that's how I ball
I need extra queso and lots of sauce
Your boy Jay Tee be on the prowl
I'll weigh more drugs than the law allow
I want three of these
And two of those
Tryin' to catch that liquor store, 'fore it close
Please believe, I does it right
And superhard is what I does tonight
I drinks Patron
Shot for shot
And when my dick gets hard, I gots to squat
Drop me off
And the Easy Eight
Cause I can't make my beezy wait
She laid up in her room, straight perkin', bitch
Bout to lay a player seat, but she workin' it

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook
