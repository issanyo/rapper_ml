(Chorus)
Sometimes I wanna get away from all the confusion
Causin' pollution
I know you wish you could run away from this institution
Cause there's no solution, to survive

Another day when I'm waking up
I turn my TV on CNN
Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen
Somebody hit the twin towers, ? and the buildings came tumbling down
All we could do was watch in tears
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down
Then, I heard a sound when I turned around
This old man said pray for me
Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me?
I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm
But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair
I got greens fresh off the farm
And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try
I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the knowledge you promised so pass it by
And then he said...

(Chorus)
From dusk to dawn, mom's always tellin me you must move on
Let the past be the last thing to dust you son
And I trust you mom
But the ? lust for fun, wanna bust my gun
Wasn't much to some, then you measured up to most started walking down the road
To the treasure up the post
You just never f***ing know what you gonna see, where ya gonna be, who you gonna meet
It's true you gonna sleepin, slip into silence
Shot guns fired, choppers and sirens
Spotlight shinin, flashin on the glance
At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass

I be sayin though, livin my life... wishin' and hopin
I be sayin though, chasin the dreams...
I be sayin though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry
That's how we know man, why that's why

I be sayin though taken away from the frustration
I be sayin though teach me to use my imagination
I be sayin though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry
That's how we know man, why that's why

(Chorus)
