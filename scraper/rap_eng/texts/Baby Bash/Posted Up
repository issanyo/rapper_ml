Chorus: Baby Bash
Man
I'm just posted up
Man, I'm just posted up
I'm just marinatin'
Man
I'm just posted up
Man, I'm just posted up
I'm just marinatin'

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
I'm on that PS2
Cause it ain't nothin to do
Marinatin' with my folks, Jay smashin' the crew
I'm screening
All my calls
Cause some of y'all are too much
I still love ya, but I been on paper too months
And if you do get through
And ask what I'm doin'
Kickin' back, I'm just chillin', mayne
Barbecuin'
You'll never know, some cool heinas might slide by
They in the neighborhood and love to get, way high
And if my cousin bring a crew
Then it's over
They all fine as fuck
And they all blow big douja
Then hit me back
My other line just beeped
And if you come through, stop and get, me some sweets

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
Well now
You never what's next, when you at my Jones
Some watchin' Sports Center, some, playin' some bones
AC turned up, so it's nice and cool
It's humid outside, so we does what we do
I got some brand new beats Russell Lee just made
I might write a song, while I catch me a fade
With Hennessey
Lemon squeeze and that cognac killer
That boy
Happy P
Yeah, that's my ninja
There's nothing to a bossalini like Basherini
I might, throw a pool party, bring, your bikini
But mayne, hit me back
My other line just beeped
And if you come through, stop and get, me some sweets

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 3)
I might
Get my knees dirty
From shootin' some dice
I might
Make a mack run, to the store for some ice
I might take a magnet, hibernate and get rest
But either way I do it, mayne, it's achin' my chest
And if you ask me again, I'm a tell you the same (What?)
I'm just posted up
Man
Posted up
Man, I'm just posted up
I'm just marinatin'

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Baby Bash]
Yo
Loungin'
On some of that hill
Yeah
That fluffy fluff
Take me a day off, mayne
Dirty out there, mayne
Let me clean my shoes up a little bit
Ha ha
There it is
