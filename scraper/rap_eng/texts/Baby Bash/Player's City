Are you all buckled up?
Here we go

[Verse 1: Don Cisco & A.L.T.]
I come from the city of players
And my uncle Roger, baby, he's the mayor
See, we all got paper so we pops a [{*cacas*}]
I hangs with money makers and I rolls with ballers
Sucker free city, theme song Doo Wah Diddy
Mercedes on 20"s, all the ladies look pretty
Zapp in the background, time to put my mack down
Player's City homie, tell 'em how we put it down
[A.L.T.]
You see my Impala rolling down the road
It's on 'em 100 spoke (???) and they silent golden
I got so rough bumping out the radio
And your baby wanna know how them players flow
So slide on in and we gone take a trip
If you a freak Goldie, if you a player or pimp
Everybody wanna be where the switches get hit
Player city of punks where the riders won't quit

[Chorus: Bigg Bobb & A.L.T.]
[Bigg Robb] Won't you run and ride with me
And let me show you where the party's at

[Verse 2: JV & Mr.Gee]
I'm in a crowd of 2000, they pumping it loud
I been in Player's City, ain't no busters aloud
We gone freak this party till the sun come up
Where the homeboys are fine and the ladies done up
I come up to the front, see the fellas from Zapp

I'm ready to rave, I see Roger on the stage
[Bigg Robb] Baby, baby, baby, baby

On the dance floor, up in the club
With more bounce to the ounce, throw your hands up

[Verse 3: Baby Bash & C-Blunt]
Well now it ain't no set tripping, everybody living
Cadillac dripping with them super fly woman
Skying high like an eagle, Latino very stylo
They ask, "Baby Bash, why your game is so frio?"
I be straightening on them days, money motivations
And here in D.C., we don't allow playa-hation
Do the math, mama, count it, one, two, three
Me gon' get with you, but you no get no money
[C-Blunt]
Top dawg with the front, bouncing on a 6-6
'Riffic, code name Mr. Blunt
I'm on a one way, headed to the spot
Where players rest, it's a lot of work in keeping it hot
To take a box and making a dock keeping it real tight
Everybody ready to drop, I think I just might
Swoop my dawgs and head to P. City
Where the players (???)

[Chorus: Bigg Bobb & A.L.T.]
[Bigg Robb] Won't you run and ride with me
And let me show you where the party's at
