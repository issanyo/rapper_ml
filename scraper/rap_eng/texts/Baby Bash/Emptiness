This emptyness that I feel that really just ain't my style

(Even though it hurts, you gotta make it work baby)
This emptiness that I feel is gonna be here a while
(Something kinda strange, now that your away baby)
This emptiness that I feel, it really just ain't my style
(Even though it hurts, you gotta make it work baby)

It's hard to believe, you're not here with me
Where will I go, where will I be
Lost without you, you were my dreams
Better move on, as hard as it seems

I try to tell myself forget the past
I think that I'm losing my mind 'cause you ain't coming back
I gotta play it right, keep it cool, keep control
I'm tryin all this time to let you go

I miss you and I want you
I really gotta have you, one more time
Boy I love you and I need you
I really gotta have you, one more time

This emptiness that I feel is gonna be here a while
(Something kinda strange, now that your away baby)
This emptiness that I feel, it really just ain't my style
(Even though it hurts, you gotta make it work baby)

This emptiness that I feel is gonna be here a while
(Feeling kinda strange, now that your away baby)
This emptiness that I feel, it really just ain't my style
(Even though it hurts, gotta make it work baby)

I miss you and I want you
I really gotta have you, one more time

The harder I try, the deeper I sink
But love has me blind, I can't even think
It's only a while, then it will leave
And then I'll move on, this really ain't me

Whatever am I gonna do
You got me stressin' over losin' you
Gotta keep it right, keep it cool, keep control
Tryin' all the time to let you go

Boy I love you and I need you
I really gotta have you, one more time
(One more time)

This emptiness that I feel is gonna be here a while
(Something kinda strange, now that your away baby)
This emptiness that I feel, it really just ain't my style
(Even though it hurts, you gotta make it work baby)

This emptiness and the way you makin' me feel
Is it real, do I wanna continue lovin' you still
Here's the deal, Do I hang on to something that's been killed
Or move on and stay strong and continue to walk uphill
But I will always hold memories in my mind
But until, it's gonna take all of me all the time to unwind
Forget about what we had and the lies
I was blind before but now you're gonna i'll be fine

This emptiness that I feel is gonna be here a while
(Something kinda strange, now that your away baby)
This emptiness that I feel, it really just ain't my style
(Even though it hurts, you gotta make it work baby)

This emptiness that I feel is gonna be here a while
(Something kinda strange, now that your away baby)
This emptiness that I feel, it really just ain't my style
(Even though it hurts, you gotta make it work baby)
