She fine as hell
Make you wanna step up
And grind her tail
Paint a picture
And find the tail

Raise that rain man without question
Muscle man
Hustle man without flexin
In the lamba grindin out
Then i hit the clubs straight wildnout

Chorus

I dont stunt no more

5 foot actin like a tall guy
Your girlfriend was on me like all night
Now she wanna ride like raw hide
Trooper the young do it mover

Puttin women on my lure
You need no map girl

See the handprint under her panties
War in the speakers

Checkin out the baby with the big ol knockers

Gettin ready for the headbull
Late night stay awake till i getchu
Yea just wait till i getchu
