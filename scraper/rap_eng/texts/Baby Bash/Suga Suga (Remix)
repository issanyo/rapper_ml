(Chorus: Major Riley)
You got me lifted, shifted higha than da ceilin'
And oo wee it is the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted feeling so splifted suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly (ayo)
Suga suga how you get so fly
Suga suga how you get so fly (ayo)
Suga suga how you get so fly

(Verse 1: Baby Bash (fast):)
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doin' what we do watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl you keep it so fly witcha sweet hunny buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
Off top I can't lie, I love to get blowed
You my lil' suga, i'm ya lil' chulo
And every time we kick it, it's off to the groovy
Treat cha' like my stickey ickey or my sweet oowey gooey (fa real though)

(Chorus: Major Riley)

(Verse 2: Baby Bash (fast):)
Now I ain't worried 'bout a thing cuz I just hit me a lick
I gotta fat sack and a supafly chick
And (uh) if that ain't good than you can say we playaz
Cuz doowop she fly like there's a plane in the air (dat's right)
She full grown and settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and lovin' da o-zone
So fly like a dove, so fly like a raven
Quick to politic wit' some fly conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by da' pool
She like my sexy coo' mama wit' blades on her barada
Rockin' dogi cabana wit' hydro cabana's

(Chorus: Major Riley)

(Verse 1: Baby Bash (2x):)
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doin' what we do whatchin' screens gettin high
Girl ya keep it so fly wit' cha sweet hunnybuns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes

(Chorus: Major Riley)
