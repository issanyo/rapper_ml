Girl, I don't wanna love ya, just wanna take it down
Come, spend the night with me, I turn your life around
So girl, give me them legs, I don't know what they said
But I'm a beast, beast, beast, beast

I don't know what they told ya
But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom

We can do it on the wall, do it on the floor
Once I get up in them legs you be coming back for more
So girl, let me show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom

I like 'em jazzy, sassy, classy, noisy and nasty
Don't harass me, after I finish beatin' the chassis
Beast in the bedroom, king-size, leg room
Turn your whole world 'round, things that make your head boom

In the mornin' on the floor, take a shower, back for more
Neverendin' stories, she adore me but no "Mi amor"
Do it with a player's stance, I'm a savage in the sheets
Been bustin' freaks since gettin' cabbage in them streets

Girl, I don't wanna love ya, just wanna take it down
Come, spend the night with me, I turn your life around
So girl, give me them legs, I don't know what they said
But I'm a beast, beast, beast, beast

I don't know what they told ya
But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom

We can do it on the wall, do it on the floor
Once I get up in them legs you be coming back for more
So girl, let me show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom

One day alone in my zone, turn the lights down
See, I'm a do it right, let's do it right now
'Cause ain't no time for waitin', my clock is always tickin'
Whole night, numb you up, leave your body bed ridden

And when I hook it to the left it's like I'm bendin' corners
Get up in ya, get up on ya, hot as Arizona
Here come the splash down, welcome to bashtown
Ankles up, ass down, blowin' out your back now

Girl, I don't wanna love ya, just wanna take it down
Come, spend the night with me, I turn your life around
So girl, give me them legs, I don't know what they said
But I'm a beast, beast, beast, beast

I don't know what they told ya
But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom

We can do it on the wall, do it on the floor
Once I get up in them legs you be coming back for more
So girl, let me show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom

Body shakin', takin' cold showers to cool down
Beated repeatedly, constantly make you move 'round
You know what it do, girl, I'm a make them toes curl
Findin' all the right spots, got it locked on the pearl

It's not the Macarena, it's not the same ol'
See, what we do is like the horizontal tango
Girl, I'm a stretch you out, mama, I'm a fill you up
And if you think you can hang I'm a try your love

I don't know what they told ya
But I'm a beast in the bedroom
I guess I gotta show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom

We can do it on the wall, do it on the floor
Once I get up in them legs you be coming back for more
So girl, let me show ya
That I'm a beast in the bedroom
