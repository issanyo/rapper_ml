She's like azucar, my senorita
Such a sweet
Tender chica
Had to scoop her when I see her
It's la bonita

Took her to the dome
Like two shots of tequila
Baby, it's Don Cisco
I put it down like Pancho Villa
We all alone
Let's get it on, sexy mamacita
Damela
Mama mello, baby, I could take it all
Give it to me nice and slow
Let me see you set it off

Well, I'm a hog in the game
A dawg in the game
A cold piece of work
When it comes to my thang
Breezy
Some call me guero when I
Stack my dinero, so I
Pack a filero when I
Strike through the ghetto, when I
Pop player collars when them
B-boys and ballers
Make you holla when I scrap the Impala
Sideways
Through your tizzay
So high, you can't see me
Believe me
And this is for my breezy

Repeat Chorus Twice

And chicks explode, like sticks of dynamite, when I unload

Lick it and bite it, mami
