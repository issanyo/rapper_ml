Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

[Hook: A-Wax]
This ain't nothin' new to me
Look at what they do to me
Need to chill
Try to stop
Did dirt wit it now I gotta buy the chop

[Baby Bash]
I'm in my mama rent a car wit 10 and a half pounds
No DL's and innocent amount of rounds
Wit my mind on my mansion
I'm smashin' up out the town
You thought I was a hog but wait 'til I clown now
Basharini believe me
Still servin' three for the 50
And I wish a motherfucker would try and get wit me
Cuz I'm nifty wit the milli when the torch is on
And play every play like it's fourth and long
Now when the horse is gone I be the shit out the pig
It don't take much to split a fool's wig
See I'm only one shot from makin' the headlines
So quick niggas got quarters and deadline's
Shakin' the fed time
They checkin' my bar codes
ATF, INS, and the US Marshals
And this ain't nathan new to me
Capitalize on opportunity
This ain't nathan new to me
Capitalize on opportunity

[A-Wax]
This old shit ain't new to me
I'm rockin' stolen jewelry
Try to chill so I leave the Bay
Did dirt wit it now I gotta keep the K
Bash a dude wig over Baby Bash
He my smokin' nephew
We be checkin' brains and cash
We count G's on a omni floor
Put the bloody bills wit the Tommy in the drawer
Tell mommy wit the roll "Go on break a lil' corner off"
I don't like that bammer
I don't wanna cough
You got to watch every step
P-walk and pull out a tec
I thought you new I'm a vet
Let loose through my set
A-W-A-X the latex glove on my left hand can only mean death man

[Jay Tee]
Now it's that pimpin' ass gringo
Bitch is you single?
I spit heat, hit the street, stack my Domingo
Bay Area lingo is what a playa blessed wit
Ten shots wit they own spots is all I ever mess wit
So if you're broke
I ain't even heard a ya
Come around me again and I'm a murder ya
I need some loot
So watch how I attack yo town
A bitch who wanna hold me, I'll track her down
Get up in the brain, take over the soul
Four G's a night, I'm ready to roll
A big long lac, hella beat in the trunk
Baby kick back, it's hella heat for the funk
I dare a motherfucker to step to the Lo
One too many drinks, now he's dead in the Rove
So call that cat's kids tell him "Get this"
It's Jay Tee, I'm a dog when I spit this
