[Carolyn Rodriguez]
In Hillwood...
In Hillwood...
In Hillwood...
In Hillwood...

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican (Carolyn Rodriguez)]
You see
I smash on you pussies
And creep with the thugs
I got a T-shirt that say (Weed is not drugs)
I got a tight spot
That sits by the sea
Three story beach house, let's throw a party
Fucked up in the head
I don't know what happened
I have nightmares, and I wake up laughin'
With a bottle of Tequila
Tryin' to reach the bottom
And why do all my ass friends have a X on 'em
Got two rusty gats
Two house cats
And I don't feed 'em shit, so they live off the rats
And still didn't even pay my warrants
I just sat up in jail and ate my porridge

Chorus:
[Carolyn] In Hillwood
[SPM] Where they ain't afraid to shoot
[Carolyn] In Hillwood
[SPM] Where the fiends play the flute
[Carolyn] In Hillwood
[SPM] Where they can't see the light
[Carolyn] In Hillwood
[SPM] Where they don't sleep at night
[Carolyn] In Hillwood

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Hit the, hit the Dope House cause I had to recop it
I need some Purity, so I screwed it and chopped it
Haters can't block it
Fuck a Judge [{*Ellis*}]
Mexicans gettin' big, so they start, gettin' jealous
Overzealous when we dip
Through the spot, into the club
Cock blockers gettin' slapped
With the motherfuckin' snub
You a thug, you a killer, you a gangsta, you a G
But I bet you with these hands, mayne, you can't fuck with me
You just a silly trick warrant, mayne, talkin' all that maza
You love to smell the shit
Yeah, you love to smell the caca
While we love the smell of roses and we driving somethin' vicious
Yeah, we comin' down, droppin' all you punk bitches

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: ICE]
Dicen que los quieren matar pero ni se pueden acercar
Esta rola es una bomba que acaba de estallar
So fijate bien y mira quien es, no somos dos, somos los tres
Los que fumamos mota para realisar estres
El mojado y sur de park, con el Bash, listo para tumbarte
Listos para un desaster por eso no quieren acercarse
So pescamos todos armados
Y el carro con rimes cromados
Cuetes en cada lado, con medicina en mi liquado
Escucha todo lo que escribo
Por eso mi estilos bien frio
Repensentando los illegales y todos que crusando el rio
Gritamos siganme los malos
Rodiando de mil caiga palos
Brincando en cada scenario, gritando "Libreren a Carlos"

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 4: South Park Mexican]
I solemnly swear to tell the truth and nothin', but
My niggas dead all because of fuckin' slut
I never love a ho
That one, fa sho
Fuck home, cause I roam just like the buffalo
I'm the baby of the family
Runt of the litter
I can't stop smoking
Cause no one likes a quitter
Every three months
My house will get raided
This motherfuckin' album is the fuckin' shit, ain't it
Hydroponic leaves
Rollin' up my sleeves
Throw your guns up, and the sky falling
Holla peace to my boys on the Hillwood strand
Tryin' to make some cash, mama, please understand

Repeat Chorus Twice
