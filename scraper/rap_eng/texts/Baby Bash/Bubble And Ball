[Verse 1: Lil Evil]
Look baby, don't ask where we goin'
We on GPS ma, we get chauffeured
Never smoke stress, blowin' on potent
You should see where I live girl, right by the ocean
California, straight west coastin'
20's on the Bently, picture me rollin'
Cherry in the swisha, what is you smokin'?
Money in the bank, we fully focused
I'm a thug momy, used to sell drugs momy
I ain't try'na break a bite, tell the fans homie
30 on the Breitling, 30 on the neckless
30 on the airplane, just touched down in Texas
Baby I'm a outlaw, cocaine cowboy
Got it for the low, [?]
I'm just try'na pace while you workin' that basic
In the streets or the bay got me trappin' in a maze

[Hook: Baby Bash & Bruce Bang]
I'mma do my duty, I'mma bubble and ball
Oldest in the game so far
[?] in the drop same color as a lollipop
We gon' kill
I'mma bubble and ball

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Rollin' with a Mexican not a Mexican
Jeffy peanutbutter leather seats on some paint
Dank in the turkey bag, cus' that shit stank
Bass turned up, woofers blowin' up tanks
And we can take a trip today, we can hit the bay
Mac and with a little Dre up in the Chevrolet
We can do this everyday, look at your diary
Lookin' at my thang, got you wetter than some [?]
Higher than a motherfucker millennium falcon
You ain't talkin' dollars, patna mane I ain't talkin'
I'mma keep walkin', bubble eye ballin'
Straight coming up while I keep the pair rockin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Berner]
Yeah, I'mma bubble and ball, don't [?] in my RAW
Middle finger to the law, flyest thing you ever saw
Old dirty bastards, cause baby I like it raw
I love dime pieces and bitches with pink feet
And a hotel suite with two bitches, I need three
I like them easy, so quick to please me
That can rock [?] in the kitchen and twist weed
I got 'em bad bitches and I [?]
Said she need the dick so she flyin' here tomorrow
I got an asian bitch with a brand new camera
I like to fuck the bitch but she straight as an arrow
Bring new Louis and a punch of OG
Ridin' slow, feelin' good, baby girl this codeine
Got me feelin' like a man, tell me how you feelin'
Me and my boys came here to make a killin'
They catching feelings

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lucky Luciano]
Call me luggy Louis, my lil lugage say Louis
All about the goody, gettin' dollas is my duty
I ball, did you notice? Pull up in a Lotus
Sorta like a big deal, I autograph posters
Posin', but I ain't got stage pride
I just got a lot of ice, give you girl a lot of pipe
I'm nice, crowd gettin' choosed when I walk in
Me and Lil Evil go on beast up on 'em
Count cash with Bash, boys make me laugh
Promotin' fact swag with them tiny ass pants
I'm a G, momy let me show you how I ball
Take you to the mall and bought everything we saw
Rollin' red paint and my seats butter scotch
H-Town, I don't run from nothin' but the cops
From the bay to the LA, up to NYC
I got boys shooked, try'na get like me

[Hook x2]
