[Hook: Carolyn Rodriguez]
We we we mobbin
We hoggin and we doggin
We creepin and we crawin
It's time to do you all in

[Verse 1: Lucky Luciano]
Hold up im too thowed, im the young capo
5 star general, Lucky Luciano
Yo my checks too fat, the banks can't cash it
Gimme ten days, meanwhile I got plastic
Country to country I live in hotels
No ashy elbows, pedicured toenails
Sittin on a beach chair, 200 dollar chanclas
Am I in Acapulco or Puerto Vallarta
Sippin outta pineapple actin a fool
Step out on my balcony and check out my view
Im lookin brand new, I get menages crunk
Lucky Lu cleaner then Andre Monk
Open up my closet and you're in the galleria
Im the shit homeboy, call my lucky diarrhea
Covered in diamonds, get a load of this wrist
Just to show out and stunt, im the dope house prince

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: SPM]
Im kinda hotta than lava, I got a dog that slobba
I might be yo father betta ask yo mama
I practice karate like the boy Chuck Norris
Im papa bear im like "who the hell been eatin my porridge"
Im still Ralph Lauren and im still Mike Jordan
Im still comin down Orem just floorin the foreign
Never borin or simple, man im really excitin
I go to clubs and be fightin, I be kickin and bitin
I might poke ya eye out, I don't fight that fair
I fought a dude with some braids and started pullin his hair
But my boys back me up and leave nobody standin
Im like "why y'all jump in? man I almost had 'em"
And they was like "Los, he was beatin yo ass"
I was letting him get tired, man you messed up my plans
Anyway, I'mma write a song about it and tell
All my fans that I beat him up all by myself--haha

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Low G]
I might play chalupa, that's the Mexican bingo
Peace to my boys up in coffield and beto
My benz take diesel, dejame explico
If I hit the pen walk around with a pico
I used to slang cincos, chilled on domingos
Dickies look young ain't got no wrinkles
Shoot like Ming when he hit 12 footaz
I be pullin hoes like a kid pick boogaz
You can see my rolli when I dip guacamole
Got a all white pit like Angelina Jolie
I put red dots on 9 milla Glocks
Might make you think that you got chicken pox
Got rims like a spida, weed to the lighta
Its ya boy Low, I'm a killa not a fighta
Roll with china, phone off the ringa
I know you hear the hook, nigga thats my lil prima

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 4: Baby Bash]
Im at the dope house smoked out, Baby Bash loc'd out
Doin tracks with charlie brown when broke out
He choked out his C.O., did it on the D-lo
Went to see his wife and his daughter and his mijo
The game is so frio, now he tippin Styrofoam
Said he gotta be right back before the lights is on
Buts its all gravity, learn from tragedy
Just to let you know how cold them bastards be
Cause when it comes to the jealous man it gets messy
I fuck around and gotta turn into some Joe Pesci
I pimp the blood out ya mama and ya loved ones
Sell dog shit to ya uncles and ya cousins
And guaranteed that you won't say nada
Radio or not, man you still don't want no brrr--aa, brrr--aa
And thats the really really realest shit I ever spoken
Don't get twisted mayne, dope house is still open

[Hook 2x]
