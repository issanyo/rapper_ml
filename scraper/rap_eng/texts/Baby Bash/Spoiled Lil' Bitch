[Baby Bash (Paula DeAnda in background) {Baby Bash (slowed down)}]
Uptown girl, in her own world (OW!)
Up-up-uptown girl, in her own world
Uptown girl, in her own world
Party-party all night, get drunk and hurl
Uptown girl, in her own world
Party-party all night, get drunk and {Hurl}

[Hook: Mickael]
And she be up in the club, and no, she never alone
Never alone
If you ain't sittin' on dubs, then you ain't taking her home
Taking her home, yeah

[Chorus: Mickael]
Spoiled little bitch
Living in the uptown
Spoiled little bitch
She get what she wants now
Spoiled little bitch
And you know that's how she gets down
Spoiled little bitch
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Well, she look like a Playboy bunny
Got a few tabs and a pierce on her tummy
Took it to the life, with a rich young money
Party all night til the next day's sunny
Uptown girl, with a down town swag
Swinging 'em hips, with a brand new bag
Drop top Jag, a Mercedes five fifth
We created a monster, if you get my drift, drift

[Repeat Hook]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
[Lucky] Gucci, Louie, she's so boozy
But I love how she gives it to me
Only let me pick her up and then
She's so find, just like her friends
[Paula] Yeah, I'm a spoiled bitch
You can call me Traviesa
Little gritty, little nitty, but I always look pretty
And I don't settle for lesser, lesser

[Repeat Hook]
[Mickael]
Spoiled little bitch
And she living in the uptown
Spoiled little bitch
You know she get what she wants
Spoiled little bitch
Oh, that's how she gets down
Spoiled little bitch

[Bridge: Baby Bash (Mickael in background)]
2 A.M., and she's on the bar
3 A.M., still goin' hard
4-4 A.M., where the dollars at
Cause she's all of that, she a spoiled brat
2 A.M., and she's on the bar (2 A.M.)
3 A.M., still goin' hard (3 A.M.)
4-4 A.M., where the dollars at (4 A.M.)
Cause she's all of that, she a spoiled brat (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
