Im standing on the curb
Puffin on the herb
Tryin get what a mother fucker deserve
Im trying stay high
True to the trilla
Tryin get richer cuz it all about them illaz

Im standing on the curb
Puffin on the herb
Tryin get what a mother fucker deserve
Im trying stay high
True to the trilla
Tryin get richer cuz it all about them illaz

Well that's the way I put it down
R & D we faced the clown
Purple essence all around
See me and my folks we blaze the pounds
Ain't no brown, it's all green
Playas know what the hell I mean
A whole new scheme, a whole new dream
I just got me a triple beam

From a dope feen
But he a homie though
Use to be a balla
Till he started using all his dough

Rock it up, Chop it up and a Sack it up
All true to the rules may be
No fool you always actin up
And they know woofin
They loving what these gentles cookin
That's why im jukin
That candy cr√®me, wit that puddin
Baby Bash all about that cash
And that Mary Jane
You know tha game
I gots to gets tha money man

(Chorus 2x)
My playz dreams are magical
My top notch game is valuable
Im stackin my mathematical
Cuz I just bumped me a badder hoe
A Las Vegas Nevada hoe
Strip her into national
Some big old tits and ass an all
She loves all by that grass I grow
Her schedule ain't flexible
They all live in Mexico
Got a semi truck with hella blow
And he scats across the border hoe
That's why, the duck is coming buckets
Posted on the gizzard
Blowing sweets like they gots trumpets

(Chorus 2x)
Before I run out
Let me be cocky cuz I have the habit
That fluffy rabbit
That Purple puss
That white magic
It got them feening
For a mouth piece that be poppin pees an
Got them sick and queezin
Can't let them haters be the reason
You taking losses
Fuckin off ur credit that ain't cool
Then you wonder why these fool ride and blast at you
That's the game and the game gonna take a stride
Its Baby Bash, baby boy im come take a ride

(Chorus 2x)
