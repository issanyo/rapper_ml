They say I'm a rapper
And I say, "No"
They say, "What you doin'
Tryin' to do
Somebody cold"
I just let the music
Come, from my soul, so
All of my people can stay on the floor
They got a brand new dance
You gotta move ya muscle
A brand new dance
It's called the Cupid Shuffle
It don't matter if you young or you old
We gon' show ya how it go

[Cupid]
To the right, to the right

Now walk it by yourself
Now walk it by yourself (Let me see you do)

(Rap Verse 2)
Dale mamita, que tu puedes
Tu sabes, lo que sudede
I seen it, I lived it
I done it, I did it
I want my bank account like Diddy
So money I ge-ge-get it
I shuffle, I hustle, I muscle
My way through the game
I cut ya, I touch ya, I bump ya
If you think I'm playin'
But back to the dance
Take it to the right
To the right, to the right, then do like Beyonce
And take it to the left, to the left, to the left
If you don't think I'm best, then dance

Repeat Break Twice

[Rap Verse 3: Baby Bash]
When Ronnie's in it, go down, on your side of the town
So wuebes it in, jump up in it, hit the floor, and let's clown
You see, it's hotter than a (???)
Hoppin' like a (???)
Right, right, left, left, kick and walk
Baby girl, that's just trabajo
Because it's somethin' so fresh in case
You haven't heard
It's not the Chicken Noodle Soup
Harlem Shake or The Bird
Because I shuffle like I hustle
On my chips like Ruffles
Man, that baby got her walkin' on
So tough, she 'bout to put a muscle
Like ayi-ya baby, ayi-ya, you lookin' fuego
Ronnie Ray
All day, baby
Come and move your cuerpo
