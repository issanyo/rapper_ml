[Intro: BeatKing]
Hooh, hold up hold up
Yuuh Zilla, Zilla
Baby Bash what it do fool?
My pack the loudest, my pack the loudest

[Hook: BeatKing]
My pack the loudest, my pack the loudest
Throw that paper, I throw more bread
Let them bands touch your forhead
My pack the loudest, my pack the loudest
Throw that paper, I throw more bread
Let them bands touch your forhead
My pack the loudest, my pack the loudest
My pack the loudest, my pack the loudest
Got the loud pack, I'm flexin'
20 bitches in my section
Got the loud pack, I'm flexin'
20 bitches in my section

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Smokin' the loudest, high power, nothin' for cowards
Organic flower, fresh as a shower, high as a tower
Roll it up tight, pass me a light
I'm smokin alike, I don't do no white
Just that purple and green all night
Smokers unite, feelin' so right
Blow like the breeze, I'm high as a kite
Bitch I'm lit up like a story night
Leanin slight, [?]
Another dab I just might
Gold leaves back to back, pack full of that satellite
Inhale, exhale, follow your nose, you know the smell
I just smoke it, I don't sell, legalize or go to hell
[?], I got loud packs rolled up
Mane hold up, I'm gettin' throwed till I throw up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Ay my pack the loudest and I'm the proudest
Cause everywhere when I light it up, niggas is smilin'
Bitches is wildin', havin' a great time
Smokin' and takin' them shots, then it's play time
Security is hatin', whole section lit
Bunch of bad bitches and kush clouds in this bitch
Fucked up but fuck it let me take another hit
Drunk as fuck but fuck it let me take another sip
Whole team ville, bitch this boss life
Ten 10's in my section, that's a off night
On Patron and Sprite, plus I'm high as a kite
Me, Paul and Bash got that motherfuckin' gas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
My packs be overloadin', hell yeah that boy be holdin'
Exotic flavor smokin', chokin' on potent, dopin'
That Cherry Pie don't ever lie, my waitress hella high
Got a bad one rollin' with RAW papers, name on Hellica
You off the best from the west, no stress, uh uh just call the king
You want to jug on all this good but bruh this politics
My packs be roarin' loud, rockin' arenas
In the DJ booth, only dab, I do come straight from the greenest

[Hook]
