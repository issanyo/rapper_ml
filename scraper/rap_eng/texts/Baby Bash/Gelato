[Hook: Baby Bash & Paul Wall]
And we just smokin' on Gelato
Smokin' like there's no tomorrow
Feelin' like I won the lotto
When I'm smokin' on Gelato
I'm smokin' on that loud pack, what you know about that?
High grade organic in my system, don't you doubt that
I'm smokin' on that loud pack, what you know about that?
High grade organic in my system, don't you doubt that

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I'm smokin' on Gelato and some Cherry Pie
Cookie and some lemon tree
Yeah you might be smokin' too but patna you not high as me
I'm on my way to [?], the atmosphere is cloudy
Smoked a onion in a hour, don't you doubt me, gettin' throwed like Howly
Long is the paper bro, I'm lightin' up the satellite
Higher than a kite, take flights, swisha rolled tight
Smoke atleast a cutie every night, I shouldn't take it light
But somebody stole my light, my money tall, check the height
I'm blazing up that good kush, I'm higher than giraffe puss'
Ash the weed before you pass and check it like [?]
Fire it up, I never hesitate on gettin' baked
Stoned is the way we do it everyday and we be smokin' on Gelato

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Got a call from the west coast, my patna got that loud pack in
I told him I'm coming on the way and I be on the next flight in
I got the swishas and them backwoods ready
I got the mud and them ice cups
I'm just living for the moment cause a lot of people out here wanna see me locked in handcuffs
I got arrested in El Paso and the police man was an asshole
They need to decriminalize it, you know it's only natural

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mr. Criminal]
[?], backwood swishas sweets, I'm straight
Mary Janes, of that I blaze, bongrips out on the highway
Cali we smoke that OG, on the east they smoke that Sour D
But from the west to the east to the east to the west
To the south they smoke that capital G
E-L-A to the T-O, take it back to the west cause we know
From the homeboys straight to the south side
That bomb weed are what we grow
[?]
Had a better quarter poud on me tho
Had to lose some cash on lockdown
[?]

[Outro: Paul Wall]
I'm smokin' on that loud pack, what you know about that?
High grade organic in my system, don't you doubt that
I'm smokin' on that loud pack, what you know about that?
High grade organic in my system, don't you doubt that
I'm smokin' on Gelato
