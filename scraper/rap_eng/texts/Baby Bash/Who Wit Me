[Baby Bash]
Oh boy...
What is it...

Hook: Russell Lee {*joined by Natalie*}
Pour it up
Drink it up
Roll it up
Shake it up
Pour it up
Drink it up
Roll it up
Shake it up

Chorus: Baby Bash
Money, sex, alcohol
Shoppin' sprees, at the mall
Who with me? (Who, who)
Who with me? (Who, who)
Mink, coats, rabbit furs
Anythang, that she prefers
Who with me? (Who, who)
Who with me? (Who, who)
Candy paint, switchin' lanes
Chrome grills and woodgrains
Who with me? (Who, who)
Who with me? (Who, who)
Love piece, chicken grease
In the club or in the streets
Who with me? (Who, who)
Who with me? (Who, who)

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
You must be, dumb or blind
If you can't see my kind
Sharp as a porcupine
We off the party line
I'm so electrified
I'm so electrified
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so
I'm so, I'm so electrified
You know there's nothin' to it
When they hear you goin' stupid
We off that trees, honeybees
With that do-it fluid
Across the river
Above the clouds
Is where you'll find me
With my people's what I'm talkin' 'bout

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Heavens to Murgatroyd
Clovers and blue diamonds
I don't know what the hell I'm sayin'
But I'm still rhymin'
And I'm so ocho fly
Ocho magnetic fly
This vodka with this Red Bull's
Got me energized

Hook: Baby Bash & Natalie

You ain't got no alibi
You ugly (Oooh!)
You ugly (Oooh!)
