Candy sweet delicious, out here
On my grind tryna get our future
And our riches. Mr and the mrs

Too strong. And on the real

Body got me stuck, and i can
Feel your energy down to mi corazon

Butterfly wishes when i smell
His cologne. Dreaming of
When i'm touching your nature

Keep the fire burning, write another
Chapter keep the pages turning
Nobody's more deserving, Chicka
You my earth and the passion to
My soul and from your love

Just to see you smile. you
Make it all worth while through
The tribulations and trails

Girl i'll hold it down, there's
Sunshine in your life and that's
Till the end of time
