[Intro: Baby Bash]
All ready, all ready
It's official
Like a referee whistle
Jesse Mac
Baby bash
What is it?

[Verse 1: Jesse McCartney]
Hey baby girl, I've been watching you all day
Man, that thing you got behind you is amazing
You make me wanna take you out and let it rain
I know you got a man, but this is what you should say

[Chorus: Jesse McCartney]
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more of them gray skies
Girl, we flying on the G5, G5
And we're leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh (yeah)
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh (man, she got singin')
She got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Jesse McCartney]
Now if I talk it girl, you know that I will walk it out
Man, I'll put my money, money where my mouth is
'Cause you the baddest little thing that I've ever seen
So I'mma ask you one time if you got a man

[Chorus: Jesse McCartney]
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more of them gray skies
Girl, we flyin' on a G5, G5
And we're leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
She got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You got me singin' (Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge: Jesse McCartney]
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Just tell him to the left, left, left
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
'Cause we gone and we gone and we gone

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Now you can tell him Sayonara and hasta la luego
Cause a mami like yourself need a soul papi and fuego
Tell that boy to kick rocks, get coast, hit the blocks
'Cause I found someone that'll hit the spot
Someone that you dig a lot
So then I kick it with me and let's go vacation
Stress free, drama free, in a foreign nation
Anywhere the water at
Baby, I'm your quarter back
Ain't no more I ain't holding back

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse McCartney]
Girl, you need to tell him

[Chorus: Jesse McCartney]
That I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more of them gray skies
Girl, we flyin' on a G5, G5
And we're leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that, like that

[Outro: Jesse McCartney]
