Chorus: Romero
God don't like ugly, homie
So why you hatin' on me
No one could judge you, homie
Don't let 'em budge you, homie
There's no excuses, homie
Don't be so useless, homie
Get ya mind or ya money right

[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
I'm on a whole another level
Check under my sombrero
I'm higher than a fire escape
Fly as a sparrow
The V-Town hustler, doin' the damn do-da
Seem
Like the game, is full of them barracudas
Them cut
Throat, wanna be something they can't do
With nothin' else better than markin' fake truth
Now tell me it ain't true
You know
The shit I'm breathin'
Is hundred percent legit
The facts, and no deceivin'
I'm behind the scenes, ridin' clean, watchin' them pop a raid
And just like fiends and weirdo geeks, them hobos love to hate
You can call it what you wanna call it, mayne, just feel free
But at least I know
All them real gatos feel me

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
[Lil Rob] Watch what you say, homie, don't bite ya tongue
I take a hit of the spliff, and put some smoke in my lungs
Yeah
Exhale and let you know what I think
I, think nothing of it
In fact, I'm above it
Yeah
You vatos need to watch ya mouth, and stop
Representing somethin' you know nothin' about
I do what I do
Don't bother me, and I won't bother me
I'm just a man, trying to make my feria too
So don't cross the line, don't mess with mine, don't
Wanna have to
Get
Sick with it, take a beat and put a twist with it
[Romero]   Romero el mero mero
[Lil Rob] Lil Rob and Baby Bash
In it because we love it, not to mention the cash

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Romero]
You could pray for my demise, try to dirty up my memory
Romero is a boss, always on time with my deliveries
And you'll get fired on the spot if you try dissing me
You silly rabbits rappin', never ever threaten me
My flow is out of hand
My game is that advanced
You talkin' bad, I got ya girlfriend jumpin' out her pants
God don't like nothin' ugly
Plus you got nothin' on me
I'll slap that garbage out your mouth and get to dumping on you
You spittin' in the wind
I'm spittin' in ya face
Better watch out what you say, when you use my name in vein
You should be glad I made it
But no, you hella hatin'
You see me steppin' up my game, you see me elevatin'

Repeat Chorus
