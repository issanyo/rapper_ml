Money, money, money, money
Thatâ€™s my lady, she will never jack me down
(Money, money, money)
Thatâ€™s my baby, sheâ€™s gonna always be around
(Money, money, money)
She will never play me, she stay true when I leave town
(Money, money, money)
Thatâ€™s my playmate
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
Sheâ€™s my peso, my denero, my paper, my playmate
Sheâ€™s always on time and never a day late
Sheâ€™s never on a diet, my pockets they gain weight
And me without her is something I canâ€™t take
Now we gone ride like the wind, my lover, my dividends
She my fatty, Iâ€™m her daddy and sheâ€™s my best friend
Got me spending weekends in Kingston in Jamaica
Oh, my favorite charge, oh, I love my paper
And when she step out of line, that he gone get on the grind
Facing penitentiary time, but sheâ€™s eventually mine
The same color as my hydro
I swear I got the only breezy that I die for, my mind sold
In love with this cheddar, me and her go together
Like birds of one feather, she keep me riding on leather
And chrome, you know itâ€™s on when my baby come home
Sheâ€™s my playboy bunny thatâ€™s sweeter than honeycomb
Thatâ€™s my lady, she will never jack me down
(Money, money, money)
Thatâ€™s my baby, sheâ€™s gonna always be around
(Money, money, money)
She will never play me, she stay true when I leave town
(Money, money, money)
Thatâ€™s my playmate
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
Love at first sight, sex on the first night
My blessing when Iâ€™m stressing
Sheâ€™s keeping my game tight
Sheâ€™s doing the thang right
Sheâ€™s beeping compliancy
If Iâ€™m Ricky Ricardo, then sheâ€™s my Lucy
My fly serenity, my pockets is energy
As a matter of fact, sheâ€™s gone bring the Hennessey
Iâ€™d love to hold her, fold her, her love is so douja
Got them dime pieces making love to my poster
What is it?, Iâ€™m loving this part of the game
And my money ain't genocide I ain't got to explain
Swinging her from lane to lane, we doing the damn thing
My money, my motivation, my national campaign
Thatâ€™s my lady, she will never jack me down
(Money, money, money)
Thatâ€™s my baby, sheâ€™s gonna always be around
(Money, money, money)
She will never play me, she stay true when I leave town
(Money, money, money)
Thatâ€™s my playmate
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
My pride, my joy, my everything
(Ah, thatâ€™s what I am talking about)
I ride my boy on everything
(Thatâ€™s what I am talking about)
My pride, my joy, my everything
(Ah, thatâ€™s what I am talking about)
I ride my boy on everything
Thatâ€™s my lady, she will never jack me down
(Money, money, money)
Thatâ€™s my baby, sheâ€™s gonna always be around
(Money, money, money)
She will never play me, she stay true when I leave town
(Money, money, money)
Thatâ€™s my playmate
Got my mind on my money
Got my money on my mind
Money, money, money, money
Money
Money, money, money, money
