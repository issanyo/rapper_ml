[Baby Bash]
You go
You go
You go

[Main Verse: Kate Alexa]
Whenever I hear goodbyes
Remind me, baby, of you
I breakdown and cry
Next time, I'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance
Remind me, baby, of you
I took a crazy chance
Next time, I'll be true
I'll be true
I'll be true

Chorus: Kate Alexa
Footsteps on the dance floor
Remind me, baby, of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time, I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in a powder room
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune

Bridge: Kate Alexa
And the music
Don't feel like it did when I
Felt it with you
Nothin' that I do or feel ever feels like I
Felt it with you

Hook: Baby Bash
Footstep
Left to right
Foot, footstep
Left to right
Foot, footstep
Left to right
Foot, footstep
Left to right

(Rap Verse)
[Baby Bash]  Now I can scream 'bout sanities
But it won't bring back no memories
Now you seem like a distance friend to me
And my music's how you remember me
[Kate Alexa] Tellin' me, "Don't cry, again
Maybe one day, we can try again
One day, you might be mine again
But until that day, bye bye, my friend"
[Baby Bash]  Tears of a clown runnin' down your face
Dance and freedom, that's your place
It's where you belong, with style and grace
Cause now, I'm gone without a trace

[Kate Alexa]
I'm hurtin' deep inside
She cries on every tune
I breakdown and cry
She cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune
Yeah

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Bridge Twice

Teardrops (Teardrops...)
