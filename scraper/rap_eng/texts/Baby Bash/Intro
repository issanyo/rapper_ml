It's the unsung hero
Latino Robert DeNiro
Fly ? in your life
Fly ? in your life
Fly

Welcome to Bashtown, where we put that smash down
The corporation up, ready when the music blast now
Nigga I ain't no class clown
I'm just a cash cow
It's Dope House, Latino Velvetism trapped out
'Cause I'm a ice breaker
And I'm a odds maker
And I'm a law breaker, jaw breaker, a salt shaker
And that's a hater hoe
If you think that's the way to go
Bet you hate yourself too, livin' so deflatable
And I don't need a goon
To hit you with the doom
To bust you in the pussy mouth and pop, your balloon
I'm so definitive
Game tight is what I give
The way I kept this bitch, finnin' show you how I live
I'm on the next flight
Smokin' on kryptonite
They try to hold the Mexi down, but we gon' get it right
I got some SPM
I got some new Lucky
Some sick Stooie Bros. Shit, now you gon' really love it

So we gon' hold it how we fold it, stack it til the end
Some say "What's upper" to a player made Mexican
So we gon' hold it how we fold it, stack it til the end
Some say "What's upper" to a player made Mexican...
