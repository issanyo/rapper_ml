[INTRO: Aundrea Fimbres]
All day
All night
I'm feeling
Your vibe

[HOOK 1: Baby Bash]
Let's dip
Let's roll
My whip
So throwed

Let's dip
Let's roll
My whip
So throwed

[VERSE 1: Baby Bash]
You know the vibe is so dashin'
Sexual passion
You lookin' like a chica from the cover of Maxim
We dippin' and smashin'
We gassin' and breakin'
The radio's locked on
Uh
They got it quakin'
And you know it's going down, cause I'm spic and span
I'm tryin' to get paid like I'm Vince McMahon
So let's put a little purple in your life tonight
High as a kite
Me and you, we gon' ride for life
Let's do it

[Chorus: Aundrea Fimbres]
All day
All night
I feel
Your vibe
The truth
No lie
I ain't even trippin', I just wanna dip with you
All day (All day)
All night (All night)
I'm feeling (I'm feeling your vibe)
Your vibe
The truth (The truth)
No lie
I ain't even trippin', I just wanna dip with you

[BREAK: Baby Bash]
Come on, girl, we doing the damn doo-dah
Come on, girl, we doing the damn doo-dah
Come on, girl, we doing the damn doo-dah
You can sit shotgun and watch me manuever

[VERSE 2: Baby Bash]
Ya whole style Super Saucy, got me ready to dip
Peel the window off the roof
Put the smoke in the wind
We ain't even trippin', let them haters hate us again
It's the sophisticated player, and we scrappin' with Hen
It's like magic
When I pull a knot out my jeans
I might hit you with "What Is It" or some "yadda-I-mean's"
And when I'm not in the Benz, they call me Cadillac Riot
And they can miss me with that drama, girl, I'm ready to party
You fin' to do it

[Chorus: Aundrea Fimbres]
All day
All night
I feel
Your vibe
The truth
No lie
I ain't even trippin', I just wanna dip with you
All day (All day)
All night (All night)
I'm feeling (I'm feeling your vibe)
Your vibe
The truth (The truth)
No lie
I ain't even trippin', I just wanna dip with you

[HOOK 1: Baby Bash]
Let's dip
Let's roll
My whip
So throwed

Let's dip
Let's roll
My whip
So throwed

[BRIDGE: Ryan Tedder]
We in the building, gettin' down like that (Like that)
We in the whip, gettin' down like that (Like that)
We at the tele, gettin' down like that (Like that)
Frisky in the morning, gettin' down like that

[Baby Bash]
Let's do it

[Chorus: Aundrea Fimbres]
All day
All night
I feel
Your vibe
The truth
No lie
I ain't even trippin', I just wanna dip with you
All day (All day)
All night (All night)
I'm feeling (I'm feeling your vibe)
Your vibe
The truth (The truth)
No lie
I ain't even trippin', I just wanna dip with you

[OUTRO: Aundrea Fimbres with Baby Bash]
All day
All night
I'm feeling

[Baby Bash]
Let's dip
Let's roll
My whip
So Throwed

Lets Dip...
