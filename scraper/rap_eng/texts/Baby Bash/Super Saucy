[Avant]
Hmm, mmm
Oooh, yeah
Baby

Hook 1: Baby Bash
Super saucy, saucy
Super saucy, saucy
Super saucy, saucy
You so saucy

Repeat Hook 1

[Baby Bash (Avant in background)]
(Verse 1)
Sexy butterfly, skin tone butterscotch
The finest linen, the type of ish she love to cop
The Miss Stiletto heels, she a fan of Barcelona
She hating attention, but every naked eye on her (Baby, oh, baby)
Straight out of Arizona, I told her that I'm a loner
I'm offering Crystal, but she prefer lime and Corona (Na-na-na, nah)
Super saucy, Sergio Roxy sandals (Yeah)
And when she in the jacuzzi, oooh, she lighting candles
Stuntin' all the way across the floor, for sure
Freshly molded by the hands of the Lord
And oh
Heaven's angel, curves in every angle
Time play two to tango, bring the hook, sang (Every way, every way)

Chorus: Avant
You're the apple of my eye
I'm feeling like a drug, I'm so, high
Everything is so sweet
Like a peach, strawberry
Baby, you're saucy
So take a ride with me off in the whip
I'll push the things to you
Just let me
Your everything is so sweet
Like a peach, strawberry
Baby, you're saucy

(Verse 2)
I'm tryin' to get it crunk-a-latin' between us, I'm sayin'
You on the brink of bubbalatin', your body's displayin' (Mmm hmm)
And I'm a spitter on the come up, been patiently waitin'
To tour Jamaica, maybe meet a couple Jamaicans (Sexy, sexy)
That makes us equally compatible, expectations
For you, it's education
For me's to rock the nation (Uh hun)
Now that's a combination
We should be modulatin'
Brunchin' on Greek salad
Under some conversation
Sippin' on apple pucker, twerpin' on that mariuchi
I'm diggin' that purse, you're matching, that's authentic Gucci
And you the chick that I been searchin' for across the globe
And I just wanted you to know, yeah (You're my)

Repeat Chorus

Hook 2: Baby Bash
Let's get it crunk-a-latin'
Let's get it bubbalatin'
You got the Motts and I'm a boss
Ya da, I'm sayin'
Let's get it crunk-a-latin'
Let's get it bubbalatin'
You got the Motts and I'm a boss
Ya da, I'm sayin'

Repeat Hook 2

Repeat Chorus Twice

Repeat Hook 1
