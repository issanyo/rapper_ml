[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
Pull up, on the double, these boys want trouble
They call me Flintstone, and my homie's Barn' Rubble
Rebel, devil
Chase em' through the ghetto
Break these motherfuckers off with just one dedo
Metal bracelets, facin', worse incarceration
Aim for the dome, gotta keep my concentration
Since elementary, it was destined for me, to see the penitentiary
Late Friday, or was it early Saturday
I hit him with the shotty that I bought from Academy
Duck for cover, you marked motherfucker
Didn't momma say not to play with niggas from the gutter
I smell under-covers, I die with my brothers
And when I'm on the mic, I represent all colors
Last summer, I escaped from an asylum
You know the three digits, bitch, you better dial 'em

[Hook: SPM]
No matter where you at, do you represent your city
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you take fools out like the homie Frank Nitty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Did your crib get raided by this little piggy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Have you ever whooped a nigga til he really look silly
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
I suck the blood like mosquito, facin' Judge Ito
Joint in my mouth, lookin' big as a burrito
Turnin' ten into twenty, twenty into forty
Forty into eighty, everything is gravy
Won't you play me in your deck-ah
Microphone check-ah
Quick to grab a chickenhead, hutch by the neck-ah
Double decker, hoes on my Woody Woodpecker
Niggas call me cryin', say that I'm a homewrecker
Berreta underneath my Raider sweater
Fuck a fine loca by the name of guera
Stackin' more cheddar, the Speedy Gonzales
Smoother than the head of Mister Telly Sevalas
Tu sabes, haciendo jales, movin' llaves
Order two tacos with the beans and nopales
Don't blame us, just because I'm famous
And got my middle finger up your baby mama anus

[Hook]
Do you raise Ben Davis, or do you sag Dickies
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Does your bitch got your name tattooed on her titty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you bump 2Pac, or do you bump Biggie
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you sleep with your wife or with a nine milli
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I got sacks for sale, in the land of hell
My enemies don't even get a chance to yell
In the black Chevelle, with my man Miguel
Little pigs wanna put my fuckin' ass in jail
Stack my mail, where the bastards dwell
Puffin' on Jane cause that's my gal
Never brag or tell, but I blast 'em well
I shoot more shots than Sam Cassell, well
Pick the chosen, and form an alliance
Move in silence and gather loyal clients
Corporate giants with street science
Cookin' dope on a kitchen appliance
Don't try it, if you can't keep quiet
I put seventeen bullets in your diet
Layin' in a puddle cause you hoes wanna rumble
SPM like Tarzan, King of the jungle

[Hook]
Do you got 5 screens in your '86 Rivi?
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you flip Snow White quick, fast, in a jiffy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
When you buy new tennies, do you spend one fifty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you smoke swisha sweets, or do you smoke Phillies?
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Have you ever bought a TV from dope fiend, Willie
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you sip Cognac, or do you sip Remy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Have you ever slapped a bitch for givin' you a big hickey
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy {*laughing*}
Do you get shit crunk, or do you get jiggy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Will you still be fuckin' when you're way past sixty {*chuckling*}
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Could I hide in your house if the cops was tryin' to get me
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Would you fuck a thick bitch, even though she wasn't pretty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
If I was doin' bad, would you smoke a blunt with me
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy {*laughing*}
Are you a young city slicker or a country hillbilly
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you like Fonzarelli or Lenny and Squiggy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
When you wake up on a Sunday, do you feel shitty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Do you pass on the ass, if you don't got a jimmy
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Just to fuck a fine bitch, would you eat out the kitty
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
Have you been with two hoes that wasn't strictly dickly
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy {*laughing*}
Do you hit anything or are you really picky
Wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy, wiggy
