3rd Wish
Baby Bash
Te quiero mucho, ha
Son las cinco de la manana
Y no he dormido nada
Just thinkin' 'bout your beauty
Got me crazy in the head
El insomnio es mi castigo
Tu amor sera'mi alivio
Until you're in my arms, girl
I can have no peace in bed
It's five o'clock in the mornin'
I can't get no sleep
When I think about your beauty it makes me weak
I lay restless at home, without you there
Until you are mine, I'll find no relief (ooh)

[Chorus]
Amor, si es amor
Your love's got me feelin'
Obsessed in my soul
Si es amor
Not an illusion
That makes me do things
That my heart can't control
I know you're not my lady
But I'm full of hopes and maybes
Till untill your love can't save me
Solo puedo hablar de ti
Saw you with your "amigo"
Girl he don't look so "rigo"
No sabe complacerte, como lo haria yo
It's five o'clock in the mornin'
I can't get no sleep
When I think about your beauty it makes me weak
I lay restless at home, without you there
Until you are mine, I'll find no relief

[Chorus]
Amor (si es amor)
Si es amor (si es amor)
Your love's got me feelin' (your love's got me)
Obsessed in my soul
Si es amor
Not an illusion
That makes me do things
That my heart can't control
[Baby Bash Rap]
When it feel so right n I don't care what people say
After I'll grab the lotion grab the blanket take a trip to Monorae
We can, do it on the beach, cause you know, how we goin' do
We goin, act a fool, even when we run it cool
Put on your favorite dress
Let's impress the town a lotta
Got the gucci bag oops my mistake
You stunt that Prada – yada
Yada Im saying
Yada I mean
Yada I holla
And I'm so proud to say one day I'll be your baby's father
You fine
Es amor, es amor (te quiero mucho)
Es an obsesión (es an obsesión)
Es amor, es amor (3rd wish)
Es an obsesión

[Chorus]
Amor, si es amor
Your love's got me feelin' (your love's got me)
Obsessed in my soul
Si es amor
Not an illusion
That makes me do things
That my heart can't control
Amor, si es amor
Your love's got me feelin' (your love's got me feelin')
Obsessed in my soul
Si es amor not an illusion (3rd wish)
That makes me do things (baby bash)
That my heart can't control
Amor
