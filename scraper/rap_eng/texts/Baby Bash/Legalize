[Hook: Marty Obey]
Now hold up, break it down and roll up
Wake up in the morning got a bad one on my shoulder
Super sexy stoner, take me to euphoria
Know she love the taste when the cookie get a hold of her
We roll it up and legalize
Gotta roll it up and legalize
We roll it up and legalize, I don't need to tell a lie
Put it in the air everywhere and we gettin' high
We roll it up and legalize

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Let me put that on my mind, I been grindin' for that paper
Try'na shine for some time, 'bout to smoke up all these limes
So much smoke you might go blind
Everybody wanna smoke on mine, but you better go stand in line
I'm gonna smoke to the dome till my eyes red as a stop sign
Gettin' to the cake all day, no breaks
I only smoke the blunt if it's baked
Wrap the blunt with a waxinate
Got a T blunt rolled up for the shake
Whole with the hay, follow your nose
Full of that good kush, still on my toe
Got me a mud cup full of Big Moe
Smokin' that Satellite kush, I'm throwed
Blazin' that indica leaf, if you ain't lightin' up you can leave
[?] just passed me the gas mask loaded with the loud pack, I can't breathe
Sparkin' that medical, triple OG, fuck the [?]
Overdose on kush is impossible, gettin' this money while eatin' me a edible

[Hook: Marty Obey]
Now hold up, break it down and roll up
Wake up in the morning got a bad one on my shoulder
Super sexy stoner, take me to euphoria
Know she love the taste when the cookie get a hold of her
We roll it up and legalize
Gotta roll it up and legalize
We roll it up and legalize, I don't need to tell a lie
Put it in the air everywhere and we gettin' high
We roll it up and legalize

[Verse 2: Dat Boi T]
I'm feelin' like alien but no James Franko
Plutonium filled in my tank hoe
Blow racks just to blow some great dro
Some men do so I'm throwed
Girl Scout Cookie still got my mind blown
Like I'm [?]
Hit that pipe, hit that bong, took a dab, now I'm gone
Now I'm poppin' trunk on cloud eight
See me comin' down on cloud nine
Lightyears ahead of my time
I be pinin' on the supply, prolly be high most of the time
[?], must be smokin' all on that fry
I still get high with the blankster, high with the players
Back in 04 stopped smokin' with haters
Still bang the block and upset my neighbors
Ain't no more blunts so I'mma smoke papers
I'mma smoke papers and we gon' legalize
Roll it up and legalize

[Hook: Marty Obey]
Now hold up, break it down and roll up
Wake up in the morning got a bad one on my shoulder
Super sexy stoner, take me to euphoria
Know she love the taste when the cookie get a hold of her
We roll it up and legalize
Gotta roll it up and legalize
We roll it up and legalize, I don't need to tell a lie
Put it in the air everywhere and we gettin' high
We roll it up and legalize

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Put the [?] in the bank, let me inhale dank
Let me get my mind corrected
The water bong out, pull a pure white cloud
Yeah that's a players method
Wakin' bakin' eastern breakfast
Yeah I'm lovin' on these [?]
I'mma smokin' on that Gelato
Californias finest, three road skittles
And I just got off that paper mane
Rollin' up a paperplane
I love me some of that Mary Jane
I really just can't make a change
And I just wanna get high again
Motherfuck you and your Vicodin
Your handle bars, your Ecstacy
Cause I'mma lighten up that top flight again
[?] Mexican stoner, I'm a one handed roller
Gotta zip of Bash, stretched on the sheets
And you already know I poked her
Yeah we all about that money, all about that 420
Yeah we all about that money, all about that 420
Yiiiee
