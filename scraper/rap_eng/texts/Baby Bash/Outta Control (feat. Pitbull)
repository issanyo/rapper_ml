I don't need no love all I need is the DJ
I don't need no love all I need is the DJ
It was midnight
I got the bootie call
She said I'm at the club
So I threw on my draw
I'm lookin' throwed in my 'fit
Candy coat on my whip
The Popo's all on my tip
But man I don't even trip
Sent me a dirty text
So I text her back
Scooped up the Stuey
Boy cause he had them purple sacks
Now we gone with the wind
It's on and poppin' again
We rebel rockin and rollin
This club is outta c-, outta c-, ou-ou-ou-outta control !
She got me outta control
She make me go crazy when she out on the on floor
She know the DJ
He's on Serato
He date them models
He crack them bottles
Everybody say fellas what do ladies like money money money
Ladies what do fellas like that monkey monkey monkey
Money, money
It's outta control
She showed that monkey
Whooo it's outta control
I'm double fistin' now, under a strobe light
It's lookin like a movie but it's feelin so tight
Now I got one in the cage and I got two on the stage
I got a waitress on the under tryna' give me some face
They play some Lil Wayne
Mixed with some T-Pain
They matched the Journey record
Now the dropped some Cold Play
And now they playin' my song
The girls they showin' their thongs
We rebel rockin and rollin
This club is outta c-, outta c-, ou-ou-ou-outta control !
She got me outta control
She make me go crazy when she out on the on floor
She know the DJ
He's on Serato
He date them models
He crack them bottles
Everybody say fellas what do ladies like money money money
Ladies what do fellas like that monkey monkey monkey
Money, money
It's outta control
She showed that monkey
Whooo it's outta control
I don't need no love all I need is the DJ
I don't need no love all I need is the DJ
I don't need no love all I need is the DJ
I don't need no love all I need is the DJ
I don't need no love all I need is the DJ
Outta control, she he got me outta control
She make me go crazy when she out on the on floor
She know the DJ
He's on Serato
He date them models
He crack them bottles
Everybody say fellas what do ladies like money money money
Ladies what do fellas like that monkey monkey monkey
Money, money
It's outta control
She showed that monkey
Whooo it's outta control
Ehh ehh it's outta control !
Ehh ehh it's outta control !
Ehh ehh it's outta control !
Ehh ehh it's outta control !
