Time goes on, no looking back
Is that real noise, or just a claque
All the lies make a soundtrack
In your mental cul-de-sac

The endless lies are going
Down and down and down and down and down
This broken trust is going
Down
The endless lies are going
Down and down and down and down and down
This broken trust is going
Down

Just a kid, didnâ€™t give a damn
All the words were anagrams
Made it seem a dithyramb
The hypocrite I truly am

The endless lies are going
Down and down and down and down and down
This broken trust is going
Down

The endless lies are going
Down and down and down and down and down
This broken trust is going
Down

The endless lies are going
Down and down and down and down and down
This broken trust is going
Down
The endless lies are going
Down and down and down and down and down
This broken trust is going
Down
