[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, what up?
Yeah, you know how we do, uh-huh, what up

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, out of town, bound 95 Interstate
When I had the Cherokee, first and flight plates
Doing 80 all the way, no traffic, really had to hit the brakes
Back then, your boy Tone, threw up a lotta weight
Ran through a few homes, in and out of gates
Buried a lot of bones with Jerry and Jerome
In the backyard, that's how the bezel got the stones
Politicking on the phone, with Cheryl and Sharone
Telling me about how the kid move it wrong
Got dope, pounds of haze, cars in the driveway
She didn't have to say much for me to pick the time/date
Then I'ma run up on 'em, and make 'em pay
I was hungry, needed more greens on my plate
I had a biscuit, and it always stuck to my waist
Yo I'm out here, trying to get this
Gwuap, open up shop, handle my business and game

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Game, you know you gotta put that work in and
Just game, stack bread, dip on the feds, and
Game, cuz we ain't trying to take no losses
We gotta eat, and after every meal, we flossing
Game, whether it's snow, sleet or rain
Just game, no sleep, Nike, boots, cleets
Just game, do what you do to get yards on 'em
By any means, do your thing, never starve on

[Napoleon]
Broad daylight, the weed purple, D gray and yay white
Youths runnin' round with AKs that don't spray right
The block's hot, feds jumping out of back of U-Hauls
Knockin' off backs of the eighths, like a cue ball
The game's sour, it's how the trees make the game power
During droughts, I replace cocaine with flour
Take ya dough, call my man, in the same hour
Minutes later, thirty things on the planes, coward
No question, we smashing your price
My dro sold out like the Passion of Christ
V.A.'s a gold mine, I'm seeing crooks cop Porsches
Twenty thousand dollar ice jet, the rock's gorgeous
My palm itching, cooking up in my mom's kitchen
Nowadays, when time cuts, even don's snitching
It's no need to come to me, with the con, listen
If I don't get paid, they gon' find LeBron missing
Alarm prison, turn in my forecast
Even if I die and go to hell, I get more cash
Than Satan, you don't like this, I know you hating
So when you get murked for your blow, I'll be waiting

[Chorus 2X]
