Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me

You too busy, hung up on me, I'm not worried 'bout you
My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life'
I'ma live my life how I do while you worry 'bout me
My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life'

All throughout my life I done the best I can
Ignore the people trying to lecture me on how to live
I made my own rules, I played my own game
And now my so called friends are jealous on how far I came

I tried and tried again, sometimes I even failed
But through my struggles I will never give up on myself
So hear me loud and clear, listen to every word
Your petty ways don't exist in this bad boy's world

Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me
Don't you worry, don't you worry 'bout me

You too busy, hung up on me, I'm not worried 'bout you
My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life'
I'ma live my life how I do while you worry 'bout me
My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life'

Please don't worry yourself, I'm doing perfectly fine
Besides your helping hand wasn't extended all this damn time
They criticized and laugh, they said I could never win
But now I see they smiling faces time and time again

Looking for a hand outs, broke, with their hands out
Shameful, trying to keep their food out my baby's mouth
Just trying to feed my family and do right by God
Just let me live my life and do my job, job, job, job

You too busy, hung up on me, I'm not worried 'bout you
My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life'
I'ma live my life how I do while you worry 'bout me
My advice to you is, 'Lead your own life'
