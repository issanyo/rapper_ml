[Verse 3: Colt Ford]
I see my cousin grinnin', he know it's goin' down
We got 'em loaded up, we headed out of town
Back to the farm with it, way out in the woods
We got three a piece, this here is all good
Gon' do some skinny dippin', slow dancin', barbecuin'
Good lovin' all night, this here is alright
We just some good ol' boys, who like to pick and grin
We have a lot of fun and a little sin
So come and hang with us, ride and sing with us
Colt and big Bone, we got it goin' on
This is our thing, so tell me what you think
Sing for 'em Bone, I'm 'bout to get a drink

Well let me give it to you
How can you walk with a ass like that? (Hahaha)
Make me want to get down

[Chorus: Bone Crusher]

Got a fine ass woman that can't get enough (yeah)
She grab my stick in my Ford blue truck

They call me the gangsta of love (outstanding, baby)
They call me the gangsta of love
