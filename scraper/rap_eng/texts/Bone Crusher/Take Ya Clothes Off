[Chorus]
Eenie meenie minee moe
To the booty club we go

Shake it like a jelly roll
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it (OHHHH!)
And let me see you shake it baby

Take ya clothes off get bucked necked!

[Bone Crusher]
Her nickname Gyro
A super booty hoe
She put that thing on you niggas 'till you lose control
It's a dollar rate to enter the pearly gates
For the sex and the love niggas gon' pay
She got a thing bout the way she move her body baby
Cuz she can pop that pussy till it's skeet baby
Oh she's a sexy bitch
She loves that hard shit
I put a ten dollar bill in her fuckin' clit
But I ain't mad though
She take it to the floor
The way she bouncin' that ass let a nigga know
Oh she a pro at this
A one-way hustle shit
Oh shake that ass baby, work for these presidents

[Chorus]

[D-Roc]
Freaky bitches in the club gettin necked for cheese
Like a girl on Sunday night off in Jazzy T
Make the pussy breathe for Kaine, Bone Crusher, and me
Do a magic trick you know thats what we came to see (hoe)
Bitch you make it hang low (Bitch I love that)
Cuz ain't nothin wrong with a good shakin'(I love that)
Now do your thing baby make your ends
Now run along and let me holla at your friends

[Kaine]
Shake it like a motherfucker
Move it like a vibrator
Shorty kinda sweet, got that sugar like a Now and Later
Hoe with them bed raiders
Only bout that bread makin'
Other hoes ain't but this bitch bringin' home the bacon
Baby boy needs you
Cuz he bout to start school
Momma gotta work
Gotta do what she gotta do
Take off the two -piece
She was down on the low
The Red Man ball so she went to work at 10 though

[Chorus]

[Bone Crusher]
It's the hustle man
Money and diamond rings
She gon' make sure she stackin' all the paper man
It's a grinder's party, 365
7 days; She gon' make sure she stay fly
Here's a hundred baby
I dont need change
Just make sure you keep movin' that thing
I love the way the pros do it, you know that!
You gon' make me revert back to 7-9
And to the floor with that thing baby
(Phone Call!)Take off that bra
Take off them draws
Get on all 4's- do the doggy crawl
You so fine you gon' make me stand and applaud

[Chorus]
