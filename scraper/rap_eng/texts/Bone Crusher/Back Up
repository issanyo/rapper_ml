( CHORUS )
Give you hole back up X 15
( RAP )
So i walk in the club ( what )
I said what's up , it is good in the world , i said what's up so i step in the hood , i said what's up now burn my shoes , i said what's up now your run running and running away from me
Hip hip in the rack on me and the grave for me
I knew that little but the bleed why you flip , down like the break down whole enemy
