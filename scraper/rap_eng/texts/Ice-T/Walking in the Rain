[Intro: Ice-T Talking]
That's what I'm talking about
Iceberg, 2006, remember this?

[Chorus: Coco]
Go Ice man!
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "UHHA!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "YEAH!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "UHHA!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Damn, this record takes me way back, to day that
I said the words I love you, I'm not the kind to say that
I spent my lights in the streets with beef crooks
Shook cats get lifted off their feet with heat
Nobody loves, you can feel the cold in their hugs
At each man checks his weapon and protects his life
The last thing on my mind was ever having a wife
NO! I'm not the type to do that, I can't commit to that
But then you stepped to me "Damn" blew my whole spot up
Dropped me to my knees, and I still don't think I got up
Uhh.. you made me re-evaluate my G
Now, I'm gangster for you, baby, you gangster for me
And we're walking

[Chorus: Coco w/ Ice-T ad-libbing]
Go Ice man! "UHH!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "YOU KNOW!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "UHHA!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "COME ON, GIRL!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
The truth is, it ain't easy for a brother from the streets
To ever show affection or an aim at direction
When we roll, you're by my side, I feel pride
And my partners got no problems cause they know that you're true
And if anything just jumps off I taught just what to do
Get low, get the bail money, call up the crew
You take a bullet for me, I'll take a bullet for you
We'll do old, strolling girl
You know how we do, we're just walking

[Chorus: Coco]
Go Ice man! "UHH!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "UHHA!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "YEAH, GIRL!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "UHH!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

[Break: Ice-T Talking]
Break it down!!
Yeah, you know, it comes at time in every man's life
Player hustler or whatever
That he realizes.. that he needs that companionship of the woman
Strong woman to hold him down, through them cold nights
Through them hardships and pains and struggles in the streets
STRESS!!

Go Ice man  -----------] Coco

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Realized I've grown in life I had to get shot
Before I understood; that you come in this world and die alone
Don't wanna spend my life chasing flash and cash
I'd rather whip through the hood with your feet on my dash
The homies understand and they're looking for girl to their own
So they can't get out these streets and stay home
It's cold when you got no one, but I've found mine
As long as we're together, girl, I know we'll be fine
Cause we're walking

[Chorus: Coco X2]

[Ice-T overlapping the above Chorus]
UHH!! COME ON!!
Yeah girl, UHH!!
We're just.. holding hands.. holding our pistols
Rubbing your booty, yeah baby
