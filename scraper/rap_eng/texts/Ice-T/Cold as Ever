When I was young I knew everything
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, now

Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot belive we'd ever die for these sins
We were mearly freshman

My best friend took a weeks vacation to forget her
His girl took a weeks worth of valium and slept
Now hes guilt stricken, sobbing with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says

Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshman

Hey yea yea yea yea yea
Yeah
Hey yea yea yea yea yea

We've tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lackin' relationships
And how were guilt stricken sobbing with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say

Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot belive we'd ever die for these sins
We were mearly freshman

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshman

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were only freshman

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
Yeah yeah yeah
