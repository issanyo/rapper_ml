(Intro) (samples vocals from various classic R&B songs)
You must be a special lady
Oooh child things are gonna get easier
Sittin' on top of the world (awww yeah)
B-b-back-back-back down memory lane
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Wishing on a star

Funk is in the house!

(Verse 1)
Driving down the street in my friend's 500
AMG and my sounds was surely bumping
Waving to the sides at the girls and gents
Yes wopping on the bus stop to Parliament
Alpine in the dash with the JBL speakers
Harman Kardon amps with the false gauge tweeters
Sounding so clear it makes you clap your hands
The wino skates the boogie in the garbage can
That's right I cold kicked it on the boulevard
The ? on my body are pimped out too hard
The Rolex on my arm, I'm so cool
Now are you with me? Cause this beat be smooth

Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)
Ooohh darlin'

(Verse 2)
With you freak momma, it's time for small dancin'
You wanna cha-cha girl, I need some romancin'
As we look into each other's eyes
Stop trippin' cause your dippin' with a real cool guy
And when the party's over I might take you home with me
A nice candle light dinner with Toddy Tee
Think about it, give an answer real quick
You thought about it? Honey, boom, girl well let's split
To my mansion in the sky build just for love
The roof opens so you can count the stars above
You're guaranteed girl to make the first move
Cause I'm so cool, and this beat be smooth

Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)
Ooohh darlin'
Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)

(Verse 3)
That's right the high roller of rap and that's me
What's my name? You know it's Toddy Tee
No I ain't no bigger, badder or deffer
That belongs to the prince
But, I'm just a checker
Checkin' MCs that come my way
With each challenging my raps in 100 ways
There's an epidemic of MCs
Like a disease, they're spreadin'
But not spreadin' to me
Cause I protect myself, I'm lubricated
Might bust if I'm hot, but, you won't hate it
Girls I'm telling you I'm so cool
Now are you with me? Cause this beat be smooth

Yo man let's get out of here homeboy
Let the beat just keep bumping in they ears
The high-rollers of rap are in control

Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)
Ooohh darlin'
Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)
Ooohh darlin'
Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)
Ooohh darlin'
Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)
Ooohh darlin'
Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)
Ooohh darlin'
Ooohh darlin' (oooh!)
Ooohh darlin'
