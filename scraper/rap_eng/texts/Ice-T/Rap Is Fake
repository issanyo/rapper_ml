[Ice-T & (Reporter)]
(Ice-T, I'd like to ask you a few questions)
Yeah, yeah what is it, come on
(Is it true that you and your organization still have underworld connections?)
Absolutely not, where'd you get that information from
(Isn't it a fact that most of your lyrics are true?)
Naw, naw, it's all fantasy
It's just, you know you just make this stuff up
Rap is fake
(Hm well government officials still say that you connected with major crime figures)
I don't know what they're talking about it's a joke
I make movies, I make records
(So you swear to the public and deny any and all criminal ties, given though your music states otherwise?)
Absolutely, I mean I'm totally legit
Never done anything wrong, you know what I'm saying
It's all a fantasy, they're just making this stuff up
You know it's 'cause I'm a black man, they're trying to keep me down
But hey
I'm totally innocent
You know what I'm saying
Give me a break lady
Get a life
