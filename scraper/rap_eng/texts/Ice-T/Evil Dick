I had this girl
She said she loved me
Thought there was no one ever above me
She wanted to marry
And have my child
But evil dick
He had to get buck wild
Took me out one night
Out with the freaks
If ever there was pussy, evil dick would seek
My girl caught me skeezin' she said
I wasn't shit!
I said, "It wasn't me, baby
It was the motherfucker
Evil dick!"

Late at night evil dick he comes to me he says
"Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone."
Late at night evil dick he wakes me up he says, "Don't sleep
Alone
Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone, don't sleep
Aloooooooooone."
Evil, dick, evil, dick
Evil, dick, evil, dick
