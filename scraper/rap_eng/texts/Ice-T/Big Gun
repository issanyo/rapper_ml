[Intro]
Oooooohhhh, oooooohhhh
Oooooohhhh, oooooohhhh

[Ice-T]
It's going down, yo, the girl got a gun
Best run, because she is, quick to flip and empty out the clip
And make the men understand where she is coming from
The hardcore is connected to the base of her fate
She just breaks and brings drama to the situation
Ejaculation of her projectile, she buckwild
Better recognize that she comes, she comes correct
Collects respect, and if not, you'll catch a broken neck, buddy
Look down and your shirt is all bloody
Looks like she caught you with the bad one
For messing with the mad one
Told you about this girl before, you didn't listen to me as I talk
Now you stalked, by the hunter of the fronter
Who's size five and sexy
Quick to catch your body and another one next week
Huh, it doesn't matter cause the girl stays strapped
She said she had enough of men and now she's looking for payback (WORD!!)
And there's no way that you can fade her son
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G X2]
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
[Ice-T] And there's no way that you can fade her son

[Ice-T]
The most venemous feminist, homey she ain't soft
You give her trouble then she might cut your head off
Or something that you like to think's the best
She'll blow big holes in your shest (*Gun Shot*)
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies won't
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies don't
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies can't
She said she gotta cause she knows a lot of ladies
Romance the thoughts of giving men their own medicine
Electrocute them, light them up like Con Edison
She got no fear, five rings in her ear
Holes in her nose, way out clothes
Living life to the fullest, buckshots and bullets
Triggers she'll pull it, Earth she wanna rule it
Maybe she will, cause she is quick to kill
The city lights make her dresses tight, yes she bites
You'll never know where she'll coming from
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G X2]

[Ice-T]
She got no time to trip or argue, you're through
I bet she gets you
Homeboy'll catch a stretcher like so many before
She is on the Bodycount tour, but not rock
She couldn't suck the punks and cops
You say she is nothing but a woman then you'll come up shot
You say why you wanna kill me? - and she says why not!
Pop, she got a body that'll make you cry
Pop, she got a shotty that'll make you die
Don't bring drama to her homey, cause you'll wind up flat
She'll put your ass horizontal then she'll pull your cap
She got no love, and love is something that she never had
She loved the mother but she hated the motherfucking dad
So stay the hell out of her way, cause the girl don't play, none
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G W/variation X2]
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
[Ice-T] So don't even try to play her son
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
[Ice-T] So don't even try to front son
