The seventh baby...

Chorus:
I represent from LA
All the way to (NY NY)
And when I get down
I get down here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)
And when I parley
I parley here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)

Touched the Iceberg baby
I'll send you under like the Titanic
Gun fight romantic
Gigantic on the pages
Of the hustler trade
World reknown for my realness
Only the real will feel this
Stainless steel is
The straps that I'm copulating
Touch'em a lady (?)
Blow your hand off
African stand-off
The general
Ice the hardest mineral
Feel me, a gem correct
One thing that I got you'll never get's respect
I stick the pits on ya
I represent California
Home of the shooters
The looters
The drug movers
Girl barracuda
Set you up for the kill
Where you're really not ballin unless you got 10 mill
I shine so bright I blind ya
Cross my crew, we'll find ya
It's a motherfuckin shame
My dominance to this game
I live for gun smoke aroma
Mack yo' bitch into a coma
Two hoes like Noah of every type
Bitches I kick to curbs, you would make your wife
Twice hit by the gun spit, kid still breathing
While half you busters in this damn game are still teething
Believe it if you say it enough that you'll be it
You never lived none of your raps, or even seen it
I mean it, every word a brother say
Everyday a brother play, kid
I politic and parley
The fact is I practice
Camoflauge to this
R & B androgynous
Get the most play
So I get fly
Do a movie - quadruple my cash
You just went double platinum
Let's see if you last
Every word that I say is documented and repeated
The truth is, I dropped the raw game, boy believe it
I've succeeded, in turning dirty dough legal
Bounced to the Bentley from the prime-it-up Regal
Like Biggie says, It's unbelieveable
My street pull
You even play like step in my way
You'll meet my people

Chorus

I've been round the world ballin, did it all, what's next?
While most of y'all busters on your first rolex
Been deep in the life kid, since 76
Touched the water, the crack game, the jewelry licks
Fix yourself if you're broke fool, that ain't my fault
The game must be taught and comprehended, then implemented
Moves done illegally, carried out strategically
Or else incarceration is felt, the hand is dealt
You lose it's frightening
Hit with 10 indictments
Kiss your baby and your wife
You're riding kites for life
Alot of y'all won't feel me, but some of y'all do
I'll move at least a half a mill of this before I'm through
That ain't the most, but I've done this longer than you
Plus it ain't my only gig, I'm still connected
With the boys that can flip a thou to a ticket
Wicked
My stature when you're in my rapture
Meet me on the street? I'm the nicest brother you meet
Confusing sometimes, the way I bust a rough rhyme
You might think I'm lying, cool I like that
I smile in your face, squeeze off the case, rock the Glock back
In your stomach, then I'll smile again
Don't want to be your enemy, I'd rather be your friend
Only the real win in the game, but what's the prize?
Every man goes through mad drama, and every man dies
Look in my eyes, touch my soul, I ain't like you
The evil I've done, I've got lots of retribution to do
That's an impossible task, cause every night the gats blast
So I look to the sky and ask
I've been blessed by God to rock this mic hard, so I do it
You got a problem, work through it
I love New York night, bright lights and action
I love bailin with my Bronx niggas, party crashin
I love switch hittin with my niggas on the shaw
You might see me in New Orleans at Mardi Gras
Or Miami at the Lex, in the Oaktown live
Or in Chi-town at the Players Ball, true P.I
Pimp or Die, Ice baby, it's a well known fact
That true players play the whole map

And we play all the way to (NY NY)

Chorus
