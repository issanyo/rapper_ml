[Verse 1]
6 in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make my escape
Don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told 'em bout my morning cold bugged' em out
Shot a little dice til my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
-Word-

[Verse 3]
Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see?
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block, no freaks to see no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly, squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye
But just living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough
Be bop's a pimp, my old freaks a ho
The batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, man you out early, we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
Swat team leader yelled, hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my .44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 7]
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed, one more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di
Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 8]
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV
A technician with a mission that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as I was screaming for more
After she waxed my body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 9]
Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 10]
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there, hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest the rest we passed, back doored the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce, we never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask

[Hook]
