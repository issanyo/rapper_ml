[Intro: Ice-T]
Iceberg, Gangsta Rap album, 2006, bitch!!
SMG in full effect, keeping it real gutter for you niggas
But all the gangsters out there ain't got a girl
This really especial to them, that's right!
I think it's to keep it real
And sing something to the ladies, sing something to my girl

[Verse One: Ice-T]
I love the way you move your tongue
Your sexy moves got me sprung
The way you lay me back in the bed
She loves it when she is giving me head
You make my body hot and cold
Your fat ass corrupts my soul
You get my dick hard as a rock
She gets on top and just don't stop
Five stilettos on your feet
Your pussy lips taste so sweet
So sexy walking down the street
Ain't got no problem carry a heat
You're just so goddamn fly
You're so bad that niggas don't try
I love the way you moan and cry
She is down with me, ride or die

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
If you got a bad bitch and you know it
Keep it real my niggas, anytime the week ends to show it
Throw your hands up, if you feel the girl that you with
Fuck your homies, she is the one sucking your dick

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I Love the way you lick your lips
The sexy way you move your hips
The vision of your big round tits
She scents the average nigga in fist
You make me want it all night long
You make me wanna sing this song
You make feel so hard and strong
She loves it when I rip her pro-tong
I love the way you stroke my dick
I love it when you start to lick
Your booty is so round and thick
She makes cum so damn quick
How she getting into those Jeans
That finest shape I have ever seen
I'm starring at you like a fiend
She makes me wanna yell and scream

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
You're skin is so soft and smooth
I love it when you fill in your groove
They sexy way your body moves
She ain't got nothing to prove
You know how to bring the heat
No other chick can compete
A brother don't need to cheat
She sicks me dry and leaves me weak

[Chorus: Ice-T X4]
