Listen up here, I'll make it quite clear
I'm gonna put some boogie in your ear
Shake and bop, don't you stop
Dance like a maniak until you drop

I don't mind, I don't mind
I can run a razor right up your spine
What are you waiting for
What do you think you were created for

Show us, you care, show us you dare
You don't know what happened, not if you weren't there

Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Voodoo medicine cast my spell
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Play that guitar just like ringing a bell
Take it or leave it

Going for broke, rock 'til you choke
It don't matter if you drink or smoke
Speak through the beat, get up on your feet
Sweating like a hound dog, white as a sheet

Don't you be scared, don't you be scared
Everybody terrified, no it don't seem fair
What are you waiting for
What do you think you were created for
Out of your seat, blind in the heat
Do the nasty boogie mama, stomp your feet

Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Go back to zero take a pill and get well
Be a good soldier and die where you fell

Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Go on out and boogie 'cos you never can tell
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
Be a good soldier and die where you fell
Born to raise hell, born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
