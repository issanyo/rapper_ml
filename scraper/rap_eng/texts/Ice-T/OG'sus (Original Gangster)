Rockin' a thorny fitted cap
Over wooly naps
Yea, 'cause he was black
And an extra-long white tee
Sandals on the feet
Chilling with the cavalry
Ready to ride on a thief
Bankers, money changers
Strangers to poverty
Wankers disguised as Main Street
Lives are demised by the lies of the elite
That's right, OG'sus gon' get you
Fire your ass up
And whoever else is with you, Yea
Oh Happy Day, Apocalypse, huh?
Winning the final battle
With Beelzebub, the Tempter
Temper, Holy War
Nuclear Winter
The kind 'a war that the whole wide world enters
Lent, 40 days Jesus spent up
Fasting, Satan asking him to bow down and surrender
Contender, Top Model
Jesus the winner
Cat walking on water
How can you not follow him, huh?

You think you're a real "G"?
Try praying without falling asleep
Discover your inner me
You'll discover you really don't have no enemies
One world
Find the center-piece
Settle my soul, God
Just find a sinner peace
I'm just a tenant with a lease, but
You're the land, lord you own the property
And I know, sometimes I treat it so sloppily
But you still fix it up, being Papa to me
Gomorrah, sodomy
Shoving glorious foot-up-ass
You follow me?

Go Jesus, go Jesus, go
Yes Jesus hung out with hoes
Yes Jesus, he ran them streets
'Cause he's a real O.G

Yea, he rode that ass into town
O.G.'sus, he don't mess around
So don't try to play him
You can't fade him
You know why?
Because you ain't create him
Got so many mansions
Understand, son
God's the father
I'm something like a grandson
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well, they can have that
I want heaven first
