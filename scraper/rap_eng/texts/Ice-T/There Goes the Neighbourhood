There goes the neighborhood

Here come them Black Boys
With their fancy cars
Who gave them Black Boys those rock guitars?
Who let 'em in the club?
Did you make 'em pay?
Who let 'em on the stage?
Whose lettin' 'em play?

Don't they know rock's just for whites
Don't they know the rules?
Those Blacks are too hard core
This stuff ain't cool
Those blacks want everything
In the whole thing world
That Black Boy plays so good
He took my girl
There goes the neighborhood

There goes the neighborhoooooood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood

Da, da, da, da, da

We're here
We ain't goin' nowhere
We're movin' right next door to you
Body count

There goes the neighborhood!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
There goes the neighborhood!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
There goes the neightborhoooooood!
There goes the neighborhood!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
There goes the neighborhood!
