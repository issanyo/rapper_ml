[Freestyle]
Malcolm X and Marley Marl, the word of God, the works of art
Portraits of the brain and other unexplained phenomenon
Shut down Babylon Smash all automaton
Feel the beat Got 'em feeling geeked like it's Comic-Con
Far from the hardy-har more like a Tomahawk
Rocket launch, Ali right cross knock they choppers off
Bomaye and Bombabe, Fresh not from concentrate
Looking very sharp today Thank you Danke, Danke Schoen
Craft working more than German engineering
And all the frequency that don't adhere to interference
Flashes of the spirit Seekers of the clearing
They say that the tongue is the mirror of the heart so mirror mirror
Look, in that window is a freedom fighterâ€™s grandson
Fixed up looking sharp, automatic handgun
Look, parade, caravan Diplomat, degenerate
Messiah Pariah The leader of the syndicate
Peace treaty written in loophole penmanship
Same rows, two sides Palaces and tenements
Dispossessed native tongue noble open the lonely heart
Peel apart Come together Come together peel apart, come together
