Come on, come on

Do this, ugh, come on, come on
Time to get wreck and kick the so on and so on
The I C E-T, O.G. M.C., L.A.P.D., H A T E S
(Ho)
Watch the mic blow
I flip scripts and the Dump drops the ammo

Time to get wreck with the new style
It's '93 and MC's are gettin' buck wild
But I ain't a nigga
That's gonna get left with a big zero as a figure
I'm gonna end up with a big sum
'Cause if you don't like one jam, I always got another one

Different, specifically I don't copy
Tear up the track if the flow sounds sloppy
I don't play one game
I bust about a dozen cuts on my LP's, none the same

I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

Boom bam, I drop fat slang
When I used to hustle, used to be down with the crack game
When I was young, I used to roll with a street gang
If you wanna squabble, muthafucka, it ain't no thang

I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Blow your dome, I hit quick as a pugilist
Ugh, ah, what's up? Now your eyes swoll'
Thought I went soft 'cause my records went gold

(Sucker)
Buster, you'se a muthafuckin' punk fool
Caught you in your eye while you reached for your tool
Now it's mine and you're blind
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop goes the nine

Yeah, what you're dissin' 'bout, friend?
Sayin' I went out but you ain't never been in
I got R E S P E C T in the industry
That's somethin' that you'll never see

I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

They can get a smack for that
Yeah, yeah

On and on to the funk track
Back glass shakin' like shit, that's where the trunk's at
That's 'cause my shit's made for
Niggas that are hardcore

Brothers is quick to hook a left to your right jaw
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on

It's time to check cash
Jump in my 4, hit the switch and lay the ass
While the Klan try to kill me
But I wrote 'riot' on my muthafuckin' will, gee

So when I'm gone, it's on
Caps goin' off on the streets like popcorn
Talkin' 'bout Simon till the early morn'
Word is bond but now I just cool
Bumpin' my Gang Starr tape by my pool
I ain't new to this

I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

Check, check, I got problems with the press
Caught the punk in traffic, stabbed the sucker in his neck
(Ugh)
Punk reporter tried to diss me
(Ugh)
Now the muthafucka's history

(Ha)
I got to make a break hardcore fat tape
Word, I don't fantasize, I don't exaggerate
Just kick correct with the 1 2 mic check
Still quick to swing, take a sucker to the deck

I'm not the nigga you should step to like a sucker
Walk up talkin' shit, you best to be a good ducker
Your posse best to run from my gun
Keep my nine off safety and E holds the other one
(Yeah, sucker)

I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Never been new to this, nigga, new to this
I ain't new to this, fool, new to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

They can get a smack for that
And you don't stop
Fuck, fuck around and get your punk ass dropped

Yeah, Ice-T
'93 for the underground
I ain't new ta this
