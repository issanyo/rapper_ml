[Intro: Ice-T]
It's unfortunate that we even have to say 'Black Lives Matter', I mean, if you go through history nobody ever gave a fuck. I mean, you can kill black people in the street, nobody goes to jail, nobody goes to prison. But when I say 'Black Lives Matter' and you say 'All Lives Matter', that's like if I was to say 'Gay Lives Matter' and you say 'All Lives Matter'. If I said, 'Women's Lives Matter' and you say 'All Lives Matter', you're diluting what I'm saying. You're diluting the issue. The issue isn't about everybody. It's about black lives, at the moment

But the truth of the matter is, they don't really give a fuck about anybody, if you break this shit all the way down to the low fucking dirty-ass truth

[Verse 1]
We say that 'Black Lives Matter'
Well truthfully they really never have
No one ever really gave a fuck
Just read your bullshit history books
But honestly it ain't just black
It's yellow, it's brown, it's red
It's anyone who ain't got cash
Poor whites that they call trash

[Pre-Chorus]
They can't, fuck with us
Once they realise we're all on the same side
They can't, split us up
And let them prosper off the divide
They can't, fuck with us
Once they realize we're all on the same side
They can't, split us up
And let them prosper off the divide

[Chorus]
Don't fall for the bait and switch
Racism is real, but not it
They fuck whoever can't fight back
But now we gotta change all that
The people have had enough
Right now, it's them against us
This shit is ugly to the core
When it comes to the poor
No lives matter

[Verse 2]
America's always been
A place that judge my skin
And racism is real as fuck
Ain't no way to play that off
And in the eyes of the law
Black skin has always stood for poor
This is basic shit
They know who they fucking with

[Pre-Chorus]
They can't, fuck with us
Once they realise we're all on the same side
They can't, split us up
And let them prosper off the divide
They can't, fuck with us
Once they realize we're all on the same side
They can't, split us up
And let them prosper off the divide

[Chorus]
Don't fall for the bait and switch
Racism is real, but not it
They fuck whoever can't fight back
But now we gotta change all that
The people have had enough
Right now, it's them against us
This shit is ugly to the core
When it comes to the poor
No lives matter

[Spoken: Ice-T]
You never see them pulling rich people out of their cars in their neighbourhoods, because they know they got lawyers. They know they'll sue their ass. They can tell who to fuck with. Unfortunately, black or brown skin has always meant poor. They're profiling you kid. They know you can't fight back. But we about to

[Bridge: News Reports]
Investigators say they are reviewing body camera and dashcam video of Tuesday's shooting. Police say that Keith Lamont Scott did have a gun in his hand when an officer shot him. But a new picture of the scene shows something at Scott's feet. A source tells our Charlotte affiliate it may be a gun, but people in the neighbourhood say the father of four was holding a book instead

Officer Vinson was in plain clothes when the shooting happened. He was not wearing a body worn camera. But we are told that three other officers wore theirs. The department is under increasing pressure to release police videos from the shooting. But the police chief says he will not do that right now because of the investigation

(Ladies and gentlemen. This shit is deeper than racism)

[Chorus]
Don't fall for the bait and switch
Racism is real, but not it
They fuck whoever can't fight back
But now we gotta change all that
The people have had enough
Right now, it's them against us
This shit is ugly to the core
When it comes to the poor
No lives matter

This shit is ugly to the core
When it comes to the poor
No lives matter

This shit is ugly to the core
When it comes to the poor
No lives matter
