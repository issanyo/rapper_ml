[Ice-T]
Coolin in my crib, cold video dubbin
FBI warning? Huh, don't mean nuttin
They call that shit a crime? Yo that shit's a joke
Hit record on my dope remote
I heard my phone ringin, I wonder who could it be
It was the E, the V, yes the I-L E
He said, "We got static - word, I just got out
Punks tried to move at the club and we shot out
Bullets everywhere," Okay what's the prob?
"Ink got popped, he's dead as a doorknob."
You bullshittin! "I ain't fuckin around
The posse's rollin tonight, nigga are you down?"
I grabbed my AK, my 16, and my baby Mac
Strapped on my vest, and threw the 9 in the small of my back
I said - Chill, don't let nobody move without me
Say you know where they are?
He said, "I know where they be"
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back

Twelve o'clock midnight, posse was airtight
Twenty-five cars, under the streetlights
Some people talked, while others cried
Ink was a brother, who shouldn't have died
Then the silence broke, Ice what's it gonna be?
38 hard brothers stood and stared at me
There were only two words that I had to say
P-A-Y, B-A-C-K
The car's loaded with a silence that could wake the dead
Pistols clipped as the chambers loaded full of lead
Everyone in the crew knew what I said
Would mean by morning, somebody else soon would be dead
Let's peel their caps back

The cars at the corner like a long black snake
Night prowlin' for a life to take
Ya see down in the ghetto it's an eye for an eye
That's the answer to the question why
In my throat, there's a lump, then I swallow it, I ain't no chump
Face of Death, then I cocked my pump
I'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull
Just layin for a reason to pull
On you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way
I'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way
But then we spot him, Evil E shot him
Dead in the face, made sure that he got him
Others ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath
Automatic Uzi motherfuckin bloodbath
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back

Then all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye
My dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die
I drank my blood as I fell like shit into the street
My corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat
Ten brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge
Cause whenever someone dies, nobody wins
But this drama, you'll never hear a word of
Cause all the paper's gonna read is a gang murder
Gang murder
