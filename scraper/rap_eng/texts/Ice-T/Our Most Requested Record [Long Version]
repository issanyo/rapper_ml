[Evil:]
Yo Ice man, yo man, they don't understand about that fly Rap man
Why don't you throw them a fly jamie man

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Word! thinking of a demo, late nights alone in my lemo
Not a Pictum my man, I'm talking black sadan
Stretched like a fine truck, E counts the grants
My plan; write a rhyme like nobody can
Totally unpredictable, understand? (WORD!!)
Talent is mine, but the judgement is yours
You vibe my records, my crew tours (YEAH!!)
You make request in my sale sore
You clear the shelves of the record store (UHH!!)
Soft core I'm not, but knowledge I got
I keep my posse in effect when I rock the spot
Grand hot, or maybe you forgot
You should've cracked the jams early before the cops block the lights
Mack magnifier, Hitman for hire
Drop when I fire, watch the guard wire
Ice ain't no lier, I'm never retire
Cause my back went ?? with young troops I inspire
Cold as nitrogen and fold as hydrogen
Thought you had a chance to wax, you better try again
Hip-Hop commando, Bum Rush Rambo (UHH!!)
Intelligence is my weapon, dum dump my ammo
It's okay plea it, call it as you see it
I'm from L.A. ~ this joint is like Viet-nam gangs illing
Wilding and killing, bars on your door please protect your children
I ain't no bad guy though suckers may try, they say I'm violent WHY?!!
Because I'm fly, got girls to date, therefore
Don't wanna hear no more, chauffeurs shut the damned door (WORD!!)
Cause I'm a player, I ain't no Beat-boy
I love the ladies and money is my real joy

[Break:]
[Evil:] Word Them Up! Yeah, I know that was down, yeah, you know the poetry was deaf
[Ice-T] Yeah E
[Evil:] You know, just kick a little poetry for my posse Rhyme Syndicate in here

[Ice-T] Charlie Jam boy, you know that, BG is in effect
[Evil:] YEAH, XT, Gustie G
[Ice-T] King Quality man, E-Mack Boy, E-Dubb
[Evil:] Yeah, you know what I'm saying? E-A-SKi in the house

[Evil:] Yeah, and my man Mike, Mike Love, my man Hen-Gee are stood out there baby pal

[Ice-T] DAT the Most Requested Record, if you don't play this record; you'll be sorry
My whole crew is gonna come down and have to..
Run a bum rush on you, you know, the same stuff took a round, you know what I'm saying?
Some ?? and all that fly stuff, you know, this is what you want, the beat
This is what you want to Rap, this is what you want
