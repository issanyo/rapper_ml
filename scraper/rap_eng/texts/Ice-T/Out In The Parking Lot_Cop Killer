[Intro]
"This next record is dedicated to some personal friends of mine, the LAPD. For every cop that has ever taken advantage of somebody, beat 'em down or hurt 'em, because they got long hair, listen to the wrong kinda music, wrong color, whatever they thought was the reason to do it. For every one of those fuckin' police, I'd like to take a pig out here in this parkin' lot and shoot 'em in their mothafuckin' face."

[Verse 1]
COP KILLER!
Yeah!
I got my black shirt on
I got my black gloves on
I got my ski mask on
This shit's been too long
I got my twelve gauge sawed off
I got my headlights turned off
I'm 'bout to bust some shots off
I'm 'bout to dust some cops off
I'm a...

[Chorus]
COP KILLER, better you than me
COP KILLER, fuck police brutality!
COP KILLER, I know your family's grievin' ... FUCK 'EM!
COP KILLER, but tonight we get even

[Verse 2]
I got my brain on hype
Tonight'll be your night
I got this long-assed knife
And your neck looks just right
My adrenaline's pumpin'
I got my stereo bumpin'
I'm 'bout to kill me somethin'
A pig stopped me for nuthin'!

[Chorus]
COP KILLER, better you than me
COP KILLER, fuck police brutality!
COP KILLER, I know your family's grievin' ... FUCK 'EM!
COP KILLER, but tonight we get even

[Bridge]
DIE, DIE, DIE, PIG, DIE!
FUCK THE POLICE!

[Chorus]
COP KILLER, better you than me
COP KILLER, fuck police brutality!
COP KILLER, I know your family's grievin' ... FUCK 'EM!
COP KILLER, but tonight we get even

[Outro]
FUCK THE POLICE!
FUCK THE POLICE, for Daryl Gates
FUCK THE POLICE, for Rodney King
FUCK THE POLICE, for my dead homies
FUCK THE POLICE, for your freedom
FUCK THE POLICE, don't be a pussy
FUCK THE POLICE, have some mothafuckin' courage
FUCK THE POLICE, sing along!
COP KILLER! I'm a muthafuckin'
COP KILLER!
