[Intro]
Yeah, Syndicate's in the house
Yeah, Geto Boys in the house
Yeah, Donald D's in the house
Yeah, Body count's in the house
Yeah, Zulu Nation's in the house
Yeah, Ice T's in the house, yeah

[Verse One]
You go on and on and you don't stop
Got sticky sneakers from the blood of a shot cop
Bailed in the club, I'm leavin' tracks on the white rug
Punk tried to rif and he met double-aught slugs
I ain't the nigga to step to
Out catchin' bodies and the next one could be you
Quick on the trigger, yo, I'm a gravedigger
Chop up a body and deep six 'em in the river
A night-stalkin' psychopath
All cops hunt the black male in a ski-mask
But I'm too damn clever
Will they ever catch me? Never!
Because I operate in and out of state
Move at a quick rate
And never hesitate to take a chump sucker down
And my H-K it holds 80 rounds
So when you move be careful and don't play
And watch for the ricochet

Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x8)

[Verse Two]
So shut up motherfuckers as I lay the ink
When I'm in Detroit, niggas fight in mink
When I'm in Chicago, motherfuckers get buck wild
When I'm up in Oakland, niggas roll in huge pile
In Atlanta, niggas crash you doors
When I'm in Philly, it's a sold out tour
In L.A., I max out real hard
When I'm in New York, I build with the Gods
So don't try to deny me my proper juice
E cuts the records and the yellow nigga gets loose
No static, just much respect
Truck my Rolex when I cruise the projects
A fly brother that's hard to figure
I punch hoes and I smack up niggas
Cause I'm a pimp and a playa
Sometimes I bump hip-hop, the other times, Slayer
You don't like it well stay out of my fucking way
Duck from the gunshot and watch for the ricochet

"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice" (yeah!)
"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice, without a doubt" (yeah!)
"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice" (yeah!)

"the L.A. player"

Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x3)

C'mon yeah (x7)

[Verse Three]
Yo D., what's up?, suckers is popping lip
Grab the H-K and the dum-dum clip and spread out
I'm putting punk's heads out
Doors is shut, there's no chance to get out
I got the motherfuckas tied with bike locks
Raise the auto-loader and let off the buckshot
{*gunfire sound*} That's how I like to do work
{*gunfire sound*} Got guts on my T-shirt
Motherfuckers tried to play the Ice
Because I rhyme smooth and on TV act nice
Soft, that's what you shouldn't have said
Now I'm so mad I'm bustin veins in my forehead
You want to get off, come on let's rock
But have your safety off, and your shit cocked
Cause when I come to get that ass
Leave your whole fuckin' block filled with hot brass
So punk, don't make me pop my trunk
Show you my amps and my Mossberg pump
Cause when I pull it, most niggas run
Fool niggas stay and get hit by the ricochet

Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x8)

[Verse Four]
Niggas wanna know about me and the "L", though
We squashed that shit with me and him about a year ago
But there's a new rule starting tonight
Diss me on a record, see me, FIGHT!
Cause in the days, you used to battle on mics
{*gunfire sound*} Now it's '91, I'm using gauges and flashlights
Ease back and don't give me no feedback
Yo, "Ice cool out", yo, fuck that
I'm hot, I'm putting niggas in cots
Some get knocked out, some just get shot
Where'd I get all the juice I use
Gotta posse full of brothers with nothing to lose
Some just got out, some will never
Some beat their cases cause their lawyers were clever
I love' em all and they know that's true
So they won't blink while they doing a punk like you
Freeze motherfucker
Get on your knees, hands behind you back
Bow your heads, if you will please
I'll swing my axe, watch the bodies fall
Watch your head bounce off like volleyball
So all you motherfuckers down with the fly guy
Look me in the face, if you're strong when you walk by
And all you punk niggas talking shit
Step to the side, bow your head like a bitch
I don't play, you'll get hit by the ricochet

You'll get hit by the ricochet
You'll get hit by the ricochet

Yeah
