Hey, boy!

Once upon a time a DJ's task
Was just to play records, what more could you ask?
But then came remixes, scratching and cuts
Which was too much for many, drove some DJ's nuts
But the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme
As the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene
So listen to him, check him out, but remember this
When the Glove's on the wheels of steel he's reckless

This high-powered music is truly unique
As the Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat
He moves like a madman as he spins his disc
He's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's reckless

Now I've seen DJ's, too many to name
Some gained recognition and even fame
But when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best
And when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's reckless

So listen very closely as the Glove throws down
He cuts like a razor to the big beat sound
Dave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like
With the Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're reckless

So listen to the music, let your mind feel free
Realize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E
Dave and MC Ice-T, you know you're with the best
Because when we're in the mix you know the groove is fresh
And reckless, reckless, reck-reck-re-reckless
