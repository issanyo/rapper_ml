[Intro]
Since the beginning of time, humans have killed each other because they disagree
The human is the only animal that actually kills for sport
The ability to kill is as innate as our ability to love
When someone hurts me I want revenge, I want them in pain, I want them dead

[Chorus]
I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust

[Verse 1]
I'm a carnivore, I can eat meat raw
I destroy almost everything I touch
I got a quick fuse, trip and I murder you
And forget you, more bullets the better
I can't explain it though, it makes me feel good
Zombie apocalypse, I live for the gore
Give me suicide, serial massacre
Execution yo, I always want more
I love the punishment, I love to dish it out
I want blood, motherfuck a submission
It's deep inside of me, violent tendencies
Like a scalpel when it makes its incision

[Chorus]
I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust

[Bridge]
I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)
I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)
I've got a love (It's a lust for blood)

[Interlude]
Sometimes I wonder am I somehow aroused by this shit
Then I wonder why certain people are pleased by others' pain

[Verse 2]
I've always had this, this ain't nothing new
This fucking sickness, probably the same as you
I love brutality, it makes my pulse rot
I mean fatality, bodies in dark skies
It's in my DNA, I don't care what you think
It's running through my veins, animal instinct
Make me mad, I want you to die
Different politics, millions of homicides
I get my rocks off letting these Glocks off
Cross me wrong, get your ass crossed up
I'm the human species, the most violent on Earth
I killed my own planet, I'm so sick that it hurts

[Chorus]
I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust
I've got a sickness, bloodlust
