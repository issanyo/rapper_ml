(Make it funky)
So the people can get down to the funky sound
Cause my crew don't mess around
(Make it funky)
So the girls can get busy,dog the dance floor
Make the guys get dizzy
(Make it funky)
Totally def as Evil E cuts the records and the beat is kept
(Make it funky)

Stupid fly,it's got to be F-U-N-K-Y
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass gain give the level's a boost
The lyric layer rhyme sayer,born to be player
If politics were my kick then I'd be your mayor
Governator,Senator,I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic,time is four, four
I'm the microphone scholar,clockin' long dollars
Here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius vocalist,rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck,mic in my first
The microphone virtuoso crazy insane I'm loco
With the speed to exceed,make other MC's look slow mo
Un-lease release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner,I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary,mine deserve a PH D
This beat is F-U-N-Key my name is Ice T

Make it funky

Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough the beat is gangsterous,call it tough
If you're diss'n stop frontin',come on whats up?
Complicated voice gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs,E.V's got control my bass
My break is comin' get busy no time ta waste
Now's the time do body work here's the place

Make it funky

Make it funky enough so the tracks lay tough
Cause I'm tossin' it up and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer,juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense suspense my voice immense
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wild'n'as I'm profilin'
Limos lined around the block for about a mile'n'a half
Autographs the list goes on
If you forgot it "make it funky" is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it,it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records so it starts again
Cause I can keep the mic cookin' for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hittin' I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records
Make it,Make it funky

Make it funky
