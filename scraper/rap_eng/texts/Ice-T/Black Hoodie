[Intro]
All these people out here tripping off police brutality like this shit is something new
Give me a fucking break
I've been talking about this shit for over 20 years
And now you can kill a motherfucker just because of how he's dressed
Are you fucking serious

[Hook]
Got on a black hoodie, its hood up on my head
I didn't have a gun so why am I dead
You didn't have to shoot me and that's a known fact
And now I'm laying face down with bullets in my back
Got on a black hoodie, its hood up on my head
I didn't have a gun so why am I dead
You didn't have to shoot me and that's a known fact
And now I'm laying face down with bullets in my back

[Verse 1]
This is how it happened
Out late night just chilling with my clique
No one had a gun, everyone's legit
One of my boys is drunk, I'm talking toe'd up
He can barely talk off that Cognac
Then the cops roll up, I don't know why he ran
Maybe traffic warrants I still don't understand
That motherfucker's crazy, the homies laughed
He might've got a block and then we heard shots
The fucking cop shot him, yo a nigga's dead
They hit him twice in the back, once in the head and leg
We all went crazy on that pig shit
They aimed at us, they meant business
They didn't have to shoot him, he didn't have a gun
What they're gonna say is "Why the fuck he run?"
We can't be seeing this, I'm like "What the fuck?"
My man's laying dead, they still cuffing him up

[Interlude]
You motherfuckers, call the fucking paramedics man
My man's not breathing, man
What the fuck's the matter with you, man?
Aw shit

[Hook]
Got on a black hoodie, its hood up on my head
I didn't have a gun so why am I dead
You didn't have to shoot me and that's a known fact
And now I'm laying face down with bullets in my back
Got on my black hoodie, its hood up on my head
I didn't have a gun so why am I dead
You didn't have to shoot me and that's a known fact
And now I'm laying face down with bullets in my back

[Bridge]
Woop woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop woop, that's the sound on the streets
Woop woop, that's the sound of the police
That's the sound on the streets
Woop woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop woop, that's the sound on the streets

[Verse 2]
Now it's our day in court, we gotta have hope
Maybe some justice, someone got it on video
They say do something, he used to gang bang
They made my homie look like fucking shit on everything
Had on a black hoodie, that's all it took
The DA portrayed him as a dirty fucking street crook
They let the cops off, nobody fucking marched
Nobody had a clue, it's never made the news

[Bridge]
Woop woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop woop, that's the sound on the streets
Woop woop, that's the sound of the police
That's the sound on the streets
Woop woop, that's the sound of the police
Woop woop, that's the sound on the streets

[Outro]
Got on my black hoodie
Got on my black hoodie
Got on my black hoodie
