Let me tell ya a little story
Bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day
Straight 40's to the head
You try to snap on him
He'd ask what you said
You still try to break
He'd start given up lead
Love to gamble
On one knee he stayed
Tryin' to hit seven
On one knee he stayed
Worked tees and weights
So he always got paid
Blew on the hoes
Every dollar he made
Crazy friends, crazy friends he had
Superfly drobe, super dope pad
Cars for your ass
And I'm talkin' class
Benz's and better
With his name on the dash
One night he got drunk
And started drivin' real fast...

Ed's dead
