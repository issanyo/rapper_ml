[Intro]
Police are hunting for two suspects in a violent home invasion
They are worried that these men may strike again

[Verse 1]
I got no plans for gettin’ loot legal
All black gear on 12 inch suppressor
44 foot desert eagle
Layin’ in your parkin’ lot, creeping in your lobby (resist)
No problem pushin’ holes through your fuckin’ body
You can’t escape me, if i want what you got
You can’t evade me, no chance to call the cops
I’m doin’ my job, this is just what I do
You make money, I come and visit you

[Chorus]
I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
The ski mask way
I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
The ski mask way

[Verse 2]
I’m in your rear view, when you leave the club
How cold could I be, you look like food to me
All on instagram, showin’ that cash off
What you really hope, is I don’t take this mask off don’t make me punish you don’t want to hurt your wife
Come up off that watch, it ain’t worth your life
I gotta crew of wolves, life has no meaning
We roll late night and hunt human beings

[Chorus]
I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
The ski mask way
I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
The ski mask way

[Verse 2]
Okay you know what the fuck this is pay attention everybody move against that wall get down on your knees lock your fingers behind your
Mutha fuckin’ head now
I didn’t come here for no bullshit we want what’s in that mutha fuckin’ safe you you know the combination bring your punk ass over here I will blow your mutha fuckin’ brains out
You gonna open that Mutha Fuckin’ safe right now
Is that your bitch? Grab this bitch bring her over here
No I will not shoot you, i’m gonna shoot the bitch, open the
Mutha fuckin’ safe now, Mutha Fucka this is business Nigga

[Outro]
New car we might come to visit you
Big jewels we might come to visit you
Flash cash we might come to visit you
Post pictures we might come to visit you
Nice furs we might come to visit you
Sell drugs we might come to visit you
Brag a lot we might come to visit you
Pray to God we don’t come to visit you
