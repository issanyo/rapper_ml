[Intro: Ice-T Talking]
Yo, shut up! This is Ice motherfuckin' T
And I've been listenin' to a lot of DJ's get on the mic
And try to get busy you know what I'm sayin'?
But can't no DJ get wrecked like my motherfuckin' nigga Evil-E
So right about now I'ma give you the motherfuckin' microphone
I'ma get behind the wheels, and we gonna do this
Yo Evil, tell where the fuck it's comin' from

[Verse 1: Evil-E]
It's comin' from the mouth of the pimp behind the wheels
I make a bitch kneel, Evil E the great steel
Shows, hoes, junior pimp, spread out punk
So I can give your bitch the Evil-E junk
I love you honey, shit listen up, listen clear
After the show, yo ho hit the rear "yeah"
Backstage pass, lick, stick tight on her right tit
My hotel, get lit, grab that ass and then hit "hit"
Hard, movin' walls, security will be knockin'
While Evil E's rockin', Charlie Jam is tri-blockin'
I'm a fuckin' mack that comes up by playin' the back
Ask my nigga Alphie, Sean E. Sean and Sean E. Mack

[Hook]
E cuts the records and the yellow nigga gets loose
