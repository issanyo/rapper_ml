[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo, check this out

Fuck that, anyway we up in this motherfucker
Security fucking with me, telling us to stop standing on the god damn couches

[Hook]
Turn down for what?
Turn down for what?

[Ice-T]
Drunk in the club, liquor in my cup
You can see that I don't give a fuck (Turn down for what?)
Get outta my face motherfucker, unless you wanna see what's up
(Turn down for what?)

[Verse 1]
Bartender just hit me with a double
Drink tequila so you know we're in trouble
Showing up to every party tipsy
Living life like a stunna can you blame me?
Now that's my kind of party
So light 'em up, up, up
Cause tonight we just don't give a fuck

You know we're always up to no good
This is rockstar shit motherfucker, you wish you could
You know we're always up to no good
Fire up that loud, another round of shots

[Hook + Ice-T]

[Verse 2]
You can find me chilling at the bottom of a cold drink
Blasting Pantera, taking OE
Sipping on that coldcock whiskey
You're fucking right, we're crazy
Now that's my kind of party
So light 'em up cause tonight we just don't give a fuck

[Ice-T]

[Ice-T]
Drunk in the club, liquor in my cup
You can see that I don't give a fuck (Turn down for what?)
Stay outta my face motherfucker, unless you wanna see what's up

Drunk in the club, liquor in my cup
You can see that I don't give a fuck (Turn down for what?)
Get outta my face motherfucker, unless you wanna see what's up
(Turn down for what?)
