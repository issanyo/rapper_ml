[Hook - F.I.L.T.H.E.E]
They say ain't where you from is where you at
Must been nigga who move and started all that
Cause I been around the world and ayayaya
But I'm be a harlem nigga tell I die ayayaya

[Verse 1 - F.I.L.T.H.E.E]
It ain't where you from it's the where you at
105 on the map breaks harlem
To bronx where it started
I walk through mecca
Blow horns like charlie parker
One two fifth Apollo reach them artist
Different area same (place) latino word
Living at the same pack lining on
The track like I'm lining in a lac
Back around the world living at the same path
May speaking like a mac I can make it lean back
Got the click clack
Harlem world autoborn the place
Where the first rap building 733 home the
First crack birth the breakdancing spining
On there back it's filthee and caz with
Ayayaya harlem rap nigga tell I die
Ayayaya grandmaster casanova over he's fly ayayaya
And brickman raw cut them pie ayayaya

[Hook - Ice-T]
It ain't way you from is where you at
Must been nigga who move and started all that
Cause I been around the world and ayayaya
But I'm west coast bitch till I die ayayaya

[Verse 2 - Ice-T]
Fully west coast who bang rolling  60 crip gangs
Rock up the  cocaine rolling on them both thing -
Heard about cause saggy pants and skake -
Nigga home of the ski mask broke and take
No jakes just hood light's out with the witness
Your whole entourage triage with  quietness
Iceberg baby got the game in a choke hold
Cook it off cock back flip the clip reload
Tighten up my bandana cripping with my ak
Hitting switches on the show bumping that kday
Don't come around my way fool popping that rah-rah
Ghost niggas live for the beef and the drama
Till the cops come with SWAT and the choppers
What you likely do end up in ICU
L.A baby  new york it's all the same
Ain't the killing you gun it's the skill in your aim

[Hook - Grandmaster Caz]
They say ain't way you from is where you at
Must been nigga who move and started all that
Cause I been around the world and ayayaya
But I'm be a bronx nigga till I die ayayaya

[Verse 3 - Grandmaster Caz]
See I'm bronx nigga and I don't beg your pardon
I was twelve or thirteen when hip hop was starting
I help lay the cement and when the concrete hardened
I watched hip hop grow up the concrete garden
I put it in around the world son as well as the hood
Helped put the BX on the map repped as well as I could
I ain't visiting no bitch I got keys I'm a resident
Ain't no client I'm the motherfucking president
43rd precinct soundview is the hood
They say our corner kinda cozy cause we getting it good
You see we live by the water where niggas be fishing
Same area they bury ya and niggas be missing
A few blocks from the bruckner not far from the deegan and
Not far away from the cross bronx expressway
I'm not hard to find right I'm by the zoo
By the gorilla cage holla at a nigga "Ouh-ouh!"

[Hook - F.I.L.T.H.E.E]
They say ain't where you from is where you at
Must been nigga who move and started all that
Cause I been around the world and ayayaya
But I'm be a harlem nigga tell I die ayayaya

[Hook - Ice-T]
It ain't way you from is where you at
Must been nigga who move and started all that
Cause I been around the world and ayayaya
But I'm west coast bitch till I die ayayaya

[Hook - Grandmaster Caz]
They say ain't way you from is where you at
Must been nigga who move and started all that
Cause I been around the world and ayayaya
But I'm be a bronx nigga till I die ayayaya

[Outro]
Yeah faggot Iceberg filthy Grandmaster Caz unstoppable
So real it can happen so fast motherfucka thrust me
Don't make us bring the gravity kid
