Niggas broke out in a goddamn rage
I even think I seen a sawed-off gauge
But homie, I was sent from hell, not heaven
I broke out with a chrome-plated .357
And the name of the game is simply survival
At the end of the night, 10 was dead on arrival
And me and my partners, we was gone like the winds
Police blamed it on the crips or the brims
But some niggas knew in the corner of the dark
Them crazy niggas reside in triangle park
They go by the name of Brunette Zel and Trey
And they belong to the association called EPA
