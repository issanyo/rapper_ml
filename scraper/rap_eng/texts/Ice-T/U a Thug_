[Layzie Bone]
A to Z
Steve Lo, ball around the motherfuckin' globe
Nigga and you know how we do this here
Nigga we do that there
Pull up a chair, bitch

[Layzie Bone] 2x
Livin' legends in your presence
Learn the lessings we stressin'
It's all platinum
We make it hot, hot, hot

[Caz]
You can call me, too sweet
Knock a nigga on his back
Penetentary six, I'm swingin' on the track
Call me Bruno the Barge
I'm livin' much too large
Muscle hard, disregard before I pull your card
Known to hauck hard, when I entered the spot
Pull some Cott but funk twelve on the dot
You think I'm not, here's the plot
Hair layed, game played
Back late at the Snootie Fox hittin' some Bray
Ain't no reason to hate
Nigga I ain't chosin' my fate
I'm a pretty motherfucker
Like a faggott wanna go straight
So wait, and let these pretty niggas speak
If you continue to doubt
I'll pull your bitch before next week
Nigga, Layzie, Caz, and Ice
Make ya gonna return like Old Spice
Nigga high, Yella's back in
Well even' Mack-10 can join the club
Even though he bangin' Blood
This a pretty nigga clique
Pock a stick and we dip

[Chorus - Layzie Bone]
Oh you a thug, you a thug, you a thug, nigga what
So bust ya gun nigga, if you a thug, nigga what
What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck, nigga what
So throw it up nigga, cuz you know we gettin' crunk
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, nigga what
Don't press ya luck nigga, cuz you know we throw this up
Nigga what, nigga what, nigga what, nigga what
So bust ya gun nigga, if you a thug, nigga what

[Layzie Bone]
My nigga Caz gave me the gat, and you can believe I'ma blast
Nigga I'ma smash and get this cash, makin' you niggas think fast
Nigga at last, it's real shit, the type of shit we bring your way
Caz, Layzie, and Ice-T and nigga we got them throw aways
Go away haters, and the fake then had they time
Nigga gone breakthrough with this rhyme
Nigga I'll break you with this nine
Nigga it's all about perfect timin', feel me
Or 'til the Lord call me home
And nigga you bet we still be, hustlin' tryin to get that dolla
Holla, holla
Swervin' in Impalas, and nigga we stay and heat 'em up
Beat 'em up Caz, put your hands on these fools
Take these fake ass niggas to school
Show these fake ass niggas the rules
Now you's fuck 'em, fuck 'em, buck 'em all (all, all, all)
And nigga we see your ass at the mall
And nigga we still ballin'
Callin' these bitches, like "Hey ho, what up bitch" (sup be-atch)
And they can't stand me
But quick to give me the patties, guess the public demand me
Understand we lookin' good nigga, and we dressed to impress
Puttin' it down for the north, south, to the east, to the west

[Chorus]

[Ice-T]
Who is the, gangsta rap inventor?
Slam like the Lakers at the Staples Center
Big pimp representer
Half you motherfuckers mentha
Knocked ya main bitch and bent her
Left her with a baby in her
I'm mainly known for endless funds, blastin' guns
Boostin' bitches, cars with switches
Known to rep the hardest city out on the west
Known to break a bitch in an hour or less
The indoor gun buster, the crowd mover
Quick to bring the gravity to ya, with the 9 roover
Reach out and touch ya with the chrome duster
The pearl clutcher
I started this shit and this the thanks I get
You fake Killa niggas get no dap, play the back
Don't O.G. me when you see, no eye contact
Cuz you could find yourself layin' on your back
Lookin' up at a blurry paramedic, Ice says

[Layzie Bone]
Throw it up, throw it up, throw it up, nigga what
	(Livin' legends in your presence
	Learn the lessings we stressin'
	It's all...)
Nigga what, nigga what, nigga what, nigga what
	(Livin' legends in your presence
	Learn the lessings we stressin'
	It's all...)

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone] 3x
Livin' legends in your presence
Learn the lessings we stressin'
It's all platinum
We make it hot, hot, hot

[Layzie Bone talking]
M-F-S, K
How we do this there, we get that K
That's right nigga (that's right)
Layzie Bone (Layzie Bone)
Ice-T (Ice-T)
Pretty boys up in here
With more toys than y'all, we hittin' switches, cockin' Glocks
And lettin' all y'all bitches know it don't stop
Yea, yea, yea it's all plat....
We told you how them Yellow niggas was makin' a comeback
