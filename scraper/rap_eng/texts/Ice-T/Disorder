WAR!!!

Our government is f**ked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred can bring you down

[Chorus]
WAR!!!
I don't want your war
WAR!!!
WE DON'T NEED YOUR WAR
We don't need your war
WAR!!!
Military beasts starvin countries
Drama brings you to your knees
Spill your blood to save humanity
Dyin for the food we feed

[Chorus]
Our government is f**ked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred can bring you down
Injustice drives you crazy
It drive L.A. insane
In this generation
Hatred is the name

[Chorus]
WAR!!!
L.A. '92

Bastard magic should make you cry
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die
L.A. '92

Police can make me under stress
While all L.A.'s a f**kin mess
Don't patronise my f**kin ass
Some heads will get crashed
L.A. '92

Bush has got his upper cut
He's goin to f**kin war
He won't revert to sticks and stones
Just bullet holes and broken bones
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a f**k!

Everybody knock ya down
No weight support so taken down
The juk-jock, ??? ??? ???
We ain't got shit, now had enough
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a f**k!

Disorder!!! (x8)
