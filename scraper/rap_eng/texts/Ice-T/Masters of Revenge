[Intro]
1994 BC Rise

[Chorus]
Masters of revenge
Masters of payback
Inciters of chaos
Messengers of rage
All we wanna do to you
Is what you did to us
All we wanna take from you
Is what you stole from us

[Verse 1]
Bodycount
You can't kill us
We're already dead
You can't kill us
We're already dead
You can't kill the truth
You're already dead

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Bodycount
You took my past
I want your future
You took your future
You took my parents
We want your children

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Bodycount
There can never be justice
On stolen land
There's nowhere to run
You can't escape fate

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Bodycount
