Before I go, I'd like to say a few things. This album was completed on January 15th 1991. By now, the war has probably started and a whole bunch of people have probably died out there in the desert over some bullshit. Theres a war goin' on right now in my neighborhood, but I can't really determine which one is worse. I think the one that we are all fightin' is fucked up, and that's the war inside our brains, you know? But, uh, I feel bad about all the brothers and sisters gettin' pulled right out of their neighborhoods, all the cities, and small towns in America that go over there and fight for that bullshit That most of them don't really have anything to do with, so I gotta send peace out to em. Also peace out to all my homies in jail, brothers that are dead locked up right here on earth. Talkin' about the brothers in Soledad, San Quentin, all the way up to Pelicans' Bay, Tracy, Chino, and all my homeboys out there in the east coast lockdown facilities. I'm talkin' about Clinton, Rikers, Joliet, you know every prison in the whole fuckin' world man, that's like, you know, all bullshit, you know? They say slavery has been abolished except for the convicted felon; y'all need to think about that. That lets you know what the fuckin' Constitution is really about, you know? A lot of my homeboys have been locked down my whole entire career, and thats some bullshit. So for them from the Rhyme Syndicate and Ice-T, I'd like to send this special shout out: Fuck the police, fuck the FBI, fuck the DEA, fuck the CIA, fuck Tipper Gore, Bush and his cripple bitch! This is Ice-T, I'm out of here. Told ya you shoulda killed me last year!
