Slow it down baby

Feel diferend music man
ICE BERG KIDS!!
Cali tippin man
Dont bother, my shits on chroom
I know what yours is

Yoh feddi how you riding?

Im in a star burst 64 riding low
On them gold daytonas and im slyding slow
You ain't nothing like me, so what ya hire me for
That bitch you with looking, keep behind ya ho!!
Its all about feddi, with the chevy rage
With a bitch on a blade
Keep me havy paid

Black 7 tray, blue bandana, dipping sets
Looking for jewels like his own santana
Break pounds down the zone, in a back gramsa
Raw ounce ing im sharp bouncing
Yeh
40ounce liquor poor like water fountans
For all the late night
Body counting

You niggas got the urge and the tentacy
So deal with me 17 the burge and the G"s
With my blood bitch, im sleeping with the
Enemy
I call it bomb pussy off n hennesy
Diverend comode same old shit
You slippin, who hit ya
The sameold bitch

Scorned pimpin, when im flippin
Cocain bricks
More bounce to the ounce
That gold frame lifts so;

Im in that bentley gt riding low
24 cc and im sliding slow
You ain't nothing like me
So what ya hire me fo"
That bitch you withlooking, keep behind ya ho"

Im in a starburst 64
Riding low
On them gold daytona"s
And im sliding slow
You ain't nothing like me
So what ya hire me fo"
That bitch you with looking, keep behind ya ho"

Living in the filty west
Gotta keep the smith and tha vest
