[Intro]
Necessary evil

[Verse 1]
Look outside my window
I still see a fucked up world
Waking up to helicopter and car alarms
Does this happen where you live?
Gunshots sound in my my mind
I don't flinch anymore
When I see niggas in my hood
They're holdin' their dicks tight

[Verse 2]
Yo, fuck my landlord
I'm a step away from clearing this shotgun
To erase the problem
Does this happen where you live?
Just had steak and lobster last night
Now I gotta rob a liquor store
But it seems so normal
Because it's necessary evil

[Chorus]
Car hit my dog, babies die, raped in a
Stairwell, cop killed a little girl
Armed robbery, shooter of a drive-by
Smokin' cain, sellin' joints in jr High
Head from a minor, sex with animals
Butthole surfers, a fucked up rehearsal
Lost pawn ticket, wrecked my father's car
Can't pay my school loan, major jack move
Holy underwear, Stuck in the pen
Forced in a gang, plain, wrapped food
Fucked up presidents, sleepin' through trash day
Hit a police car, gettin' laid off, gotta pay
Taxes, gridlock traffic
Jealous muthafuckas, bitch tried to do me
Hit and run, I got a fat bitch pregnant!
Necessary evil

[Verse 3]
Little white kid with a kool-aid smile
Training wheels on his bike thought they called me a nigga
Pushed that little bastard in traffic so graphic
He was holdin' his bike tight
He was a victim of fucked up explaining
An american example of fucked training
When the fuckin' bus connected, he flew like Knievel
I was just necessary evil

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Necessary evil
