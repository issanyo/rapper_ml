OK check this out, I got a crazy posse
I got the stupidest motherfuckin' posse in the whole goddamn city
You fuck with me I'll snatch out your car
Right in front of your goddamned bitch
And beat you down right there
I got more guns than anybody
I got crazy guns, you know, I got homeboys on motorcycles
And when we come we wearin' our blue
You know what I'm sayin'?
And I'll beat your fuckin' ass

Don't nobody call me on my name
Cause they'll get smacked the fuck up, you know
Can't put me in jail
You can't even fuck with me
Cause I'm the craziest motherfucker on the street
Don't nobody want none of this
You know what I'm sayin'?
Cause if you fuck with me or any of my friends
You'll get killed, point blank

"Excuse me sir, Officer Johnson, Internal Affairs
We'd like to have a few words with you"
