[ Ice-T ]
Now although your friends warned you 'bout us westside macks
Girl, you was willin to take a chance and I respect you for that
And at last we're all alone, baby, just you and I, don't try to lie
I know what's on your mind, I'm lookin straight through your eyes
[ Big Rich ]
So let that hair down and let that body go free
And come close because tonight it belongs to me
No brother's doin it like this westside mack
Ride you like my Chevy, hit that ass front and back
Now tell me

[ Big Rich ]
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby, stay here with me?
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Strictly on the Westside where I ride, now, baby, come roll with me

[ Big Rich ]
Now two hours done passed but then it's only gettin better
My body is gettin hotter while yours is gettin wetter
Wanna roll up in your river like a steamboat
Pretend you're takin a bath and I'm your piece of chalice soap
[ Ice-T ]
Oh my girl, can you feel what I'm feelin now?
As you turn around I'm lookin at that brown
Sugar fat coated ass
I just can't let it pass
Gotta move on it fast
Now tell me, baby

[ Big Rich ]
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby, stay here with me?
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Strictly on the Westside where I ride, now, baby, come roll with me

[ Ice-T ]
Alright, check this out, girls
Me and my man Big Rich, we got an idea
Why don't we just use body language
Let our bodies do all the talking
And just kick back and enjoy the erotic conversation

[ Big Rich ]
Hello Sunshine, now you did quite fine
Shall we rewind, relive these good times?
I feel your body gettin hot again
Girl, don't you know I'm 'bout to dive on in?
(It's never gonna stop until I know it's truly over)
I got some more oil I wants to stick up in your motor
And kiss you on the grill, squeeze your headlights
Rub your bumper kitten, gettin nasty like a triple x-rated flick
[ Ice-T ]
I know you're feelin what I'm feelin, sexual energy
Time to chill and pour another glass of Hennessy
I hit it again like a gangster should
And give you somethin to tell them girls up the hood
Now how does it feel?

[ Big Rich ]
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby, stay here with me?
How does it feel to make love to a gee?
Strictly on the Westside where I ride, now, baby, come roll with me

[ Ice-T ]
Yeah, this is Ice-T and Big Rich signin off
And to all the curious ladies out there
Take your chance
I promise, you won't be sorry
