Ice-T VI: Return of the Real
Real is a word people don't really want to deal with
Real is the difference from the way things should be and the way things are
Things should be beautiful and everybody should get along
But things are really fucked up
Opportunity isn't available to everybody
Motherfuckers do go to jail
Men and women do not always get along
A woman doesn't think twice about referring to a man as a dog
But then breaks down when she's called a bitch
That's really fucked up
Real
The first four letters of reality
You ready to get there?
That's what it's all about
A lot of my homies are really incarcerated or locked up
In federal penitentiaries or state institutions and will never come home
This album is dedicated to them
And my homies that have died and passed on in the past few years
Really never get a chance to hear this record
My music is designed for the individuals out there who are ready to deal with the truth
The truth is that anything that is alive
Will do whatever it has to do to remain alive
It's called survival
And no matter how cold and fucked up it may seem
That's real
