MAKE IT FUNKY!!

[Hook: Ice-T]
So the people can get down to the funky sound
Cause my crew don't mess around (MAKE IT FUNKY!!)
So the girls can get busy and dogg the dancefloor
Make the guys get dizzy (MAKE IT FUNKY!!)
Totally deaf as Evil E cuts the records and the beat is dealt (MAKE IT FUNKY!!)

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Stupid fly, it's got to the F-U-N-K-Y
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass game, give the label a boost
A lyric layer, rhyme sayer, born to be player
Politics were my kick, then I'll be your mayor
Governator, Senator, I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic, time is your four
I'm the microphone scholar, clocking on dollars
See I'm here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius, vocalist, rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck, mic in my fist
The microphone virtuoso, crazy insane, I'm loco
With the speed to exceed, that got the MC's look slow mode
Unleash release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner, I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary, mine deserve a PH.D
This beat is F-U-N-K-y, my name is Ice-T

[Chorus: DJ Evil E the Great]
MAKE IT FUNKY!! MAKE IT FUNKY!!
MAKE IT FUNKY!! MAKE IT FUNKY!!
WHORES!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!!
Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough, the beat is gangsterous, call it tough
If you're dissing, stop fronting, come on, what's up?
Complicated voice, gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs, EVs got control my bass
My break is coming to get busy, no time to waste
Now's the time do body work, here's the place

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!! Uhh!!
Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!! Go L.A.!!

[Chorus: DJ Evil E the Great]
MAKE IT FUNKY!! MAKE IT FUNKY!!
MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT FUNKY!!

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Make it funky enough, so the tracks lay tough
Cause I'm tossing it up, and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer, juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense, suspense my voice emends
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wilding, as I'm profiling
Limos lined around the block for about a mile and a half
Autographs; the list goes on
If you forgot, Make It Funky is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it, it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records, so it starts again
Cause I can keep the mic cooking for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hitting, I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser, E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records, make it Make It Funky

[Chorus: DJ Evil E the Great]
MAKE IT FUNKY!! MAKE IT FUNKY!!
MAKE IT MAKE IT MAKE IT FUNKY!!
Ho Ho Go!!
Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!!
Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!! Go Ice!!

[Outro: Ice-T]
We gonna do it like that y'all
Evil E MAKE IT FUNKY!!
Islam MAKE IT FUNKY!!
South Bronx MAKE IT FUNKY!!
Shawnie Shawn MAKE IT FUNKY!!
Melle Mel MAKE IT FUNKY!!
TDF MAKE IT FUNKY!! ~ AWWWWWWWWWWWW!!
