Yo T, let's do this shit baby, dog

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Is it new year God? I'm coming back mad hard
Moving harder than a convict with a shack in the yard
New Jacks wanna hear me rap, begging for freestyle skills
I've served so many rappers, I can make a land field, fool
You've doubt for a mic dude, the Ice is a jewel
Fuck rules, I got more pool than a mule
Matter of fact, you never comprehend the styles I sin
I keep breaking to annihilate fakes and teens
The Yellow nigga from the Westside cheered, I peel libs
What praying that you do, yo when I all ready did
Like your girl gotta admit she was a sexy bitch
But I hit it with the Jimmy so my nuts don't itch
So just check as I pore for the mic core
THE NIGGAZ!! THE NIGGA!! THE NIGGA!!
Six ounces, squeeze the trigger
For you hardcore motherfuckers that's been dying for.. this gangster shit
Time to squab and rob and fight, hit til you through
I got a strain in my brain like pain
But niggas sucking up my shit like I'm some crack cocaine
To you white kids, you better watch your head
As you popping down the street by these words I said

[Break: Trigger Tha Gambler, M.O.P.]
MONTREUX MAKE SOME GODDAMN NOISE!!
YEAH!! COME ON!! UHH!!
GET THEM UP Y'ALL!! YEAH!!
COME ON MAN, LET'S RIP THIS SHIT!!
RIP THIS SHIT UP!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is crowd, and a M-I-C
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil-E
My record label's called Warner B
William Morris is my agent
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums, so what you're telling me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benz's, Bemers, and booming Jeeps
I'm always strapped, cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice, and you're going to sleep
But when you see me walking down the street
You say, "What's up Ice?" -- what would I say, "Peace!"
You give me a dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped, so forget about that
We might take a picture or sign an autograph
Kick a little flavor to have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong, you might get shot
And wind up looking out a ziplock!!!

[Outro]
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!
