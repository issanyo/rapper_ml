[Intro]
People always wanna know the reason for what they consider senseless violence in the hood. I'ma break it down for you. This is why we ride

And this is why we ride
And this is why we ride

[Verse 1]
I gotta say this clear, I gotta say this loud
I should've been dead, don't know how I'm here now
I should've been dead, damn it forty years ago
How the fuck did I survive? Something that I'll never know
I played the crack game, gang bang, guns
Motherfuckers told me I'd never see twenty one
I come from LA, deep in the heart of the hood
Every night the bullets fly, this shit ain't Hollywood
Could be your best friend, mother or brother dead
Cops can't do shit, these streets are blood red
So we leave the block and we load the guns
And we want revenge, until revenge comes

And this is why we ride

[Chorus]
[Riff, sirens and gunshots]
And this is why we ride
[Riff]

[Verse 2]
I made it out the hood, I got a great life
But them bullets fly every motherfucking night
Another kid dies every motherfucking night
Another mother cries every motherfucking night
Ghettoes of deep crack, made to never escape
A place to store the poor, made to never escape
They're all over the world, people go to die
Murders go unsolved, I understand why
They remove hope and then we sell dope
Pain in poverty has us at each other's throat
Families are broken and so we gangbang
A bit form of unity but most love some of us ever seen

And this is how we die

[Chorus]
[Riff, sirens and gunshots]
And this is why we ride
[Riff]

[Bridge]
Oh man, coming up and surviving in the ghetto, the smallest argument goes from little drama to big drama. Next thing you know, somebody's dead. I don't think you can understand if you've never been in your streets and held your best friend in your arms. Your child in your arms and watch them breathe their last breath because somebody shot them dead in the streets. You ain't thinking of calling the police. You want revenge. And you want it now. I gotta be honest with you. If somebody were to kill me, shoot me right now, my last words wouldn't be peace. It would be get those motherfuckers

(And this is why we ride)

This song is dedicated to all of you who has lost somebody to street violence

[Chorus]
[Riff]
And this is why we ride
[Riff]
And this is how we die
