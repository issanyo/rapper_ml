(Civil war)

[Verse 1]
It's already started, maybe too late to stop
It's already on, they shooting the cops
They pushing the line, racism is high
The country's divided, you know the fuck why
The press of the pull, and push of the truth
The public is dumb, delusional youth
Our leaders are evil, lie after lie
The public is armed, and ready to die
(Ready to die)

[Chorus]
(Civil war)
What side you on when the shit pops off?
Black or white, wrong or right?
(Civil war)
Rich or poor, urban war
Shit might just jump off tonight
(Civil war)
What side you on when the shit pops off?
Black or white, wrong or right?
(Civil war)
This shit is true
Coming soon to a town near you

[Verse 2]
They don't care about nothing, just personal gain
These politicians wouldn't mind a war, motherfuck your pain
Cops are killing people and never do time
In the hood we killing each other like that ain't no crime
I'm feeling the tension, don't tell me you don't
These fools will get us all killed, don't tell me they won't
There's guns on the streets, it's already too late
The net's overloaded with pure racial hate
The press just instigate, they love a fight
Don't give a fuck about who gets hurt just news that night
They try and twist the problem like it's white and black
But if you come to shoot me, yo I'm shooting back

[Chorus]
(Civil war)
What side you on when the shit pops off?
Black or white, wrong or right?
(Civil war)
Rich or poor, urban war
Shit might just jump off tonight
(Civil war)
What side you on when the shit pops off?
Black or white, wrong or right?
(Civil war)
This shit is true
Coming soon to a town near you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(Civil war)
What side you on when the shit pops off?
Black or white, wrong or right?
(Civil war)
Rich or poor, urban war
Shit might just jump off tonight
(Civil war)
What side you on when the shit pops off?
Black or white, wrong or right?
(Civil war)
This shit is true
Coming soon to a town near you
