Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
Because I be layin' rhymes super sly, cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it
Raise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel
Pump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil
Listen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man
But that's natural, cause you know that I am
No punk, no chump, no fool, no toy
Try to get ill and serve you, boy

I'm on a hype tip, this ain't no ego trip
Just rollin' thick as hell, champagne I sip as well
Listen and you'll envision, this rap's metabolism
I think the beat is dope, but it's still your decision
Whether to turn it on, turn it off
Turn it up, make it loud, make it soft
EQ me with new frequencies or
Just rewind me till the tape bleeds
My heartbeat's kickin' like a saturday movie
Some say it's def, some say it's groovy
I say it's fly, you know why?
Because it's spoken by the brother, whose name is spent with the "I"
The C-E-T., Cold Chillin' rhyme villain on the M-I-C
With raps roarin', I'm never borin', I keep tourin'
My record sales keep soarin' and soarin'
I'll make a million, maybe two
Buy some rides, gold blow the dough on my crew
Wake up the next morning broke as hell
But not for long cause my records sell

My heartbeat's kickin' like a gun shot
Why not?That's who I made it for, the hardrocks
Better watch your gold when the posse breaks
Because what they want is what they take
But I'm coolin', I'm never foolin', too busy rulin'
Sucker emcees who need microphone schoolin'
Leave'em dazed, dogged, served and droolin'
By the playin' punk slayin' mac of microphone duelin'

Heartbeat (scratch freestyle)

This conglomeration is just a demonstration
Of rap's penetration to the core of our nation
Some rappers get down with toy commercial sounds
I had my choice, I chose the underground
Like me or hate me, now if you want you can rate me
My beat is by ISLAM, the cut's by the great E.
My heartbeat is kickin', it's kickin' louder and louder
It's gettin' deffer and deffer, I'm feelin' prouder and prouder
Not robbin' or killin', just mic illin'
The phone rings, "WE MADE ANOTHER MILLION"
Break out the Dom and pop the corks
Catch a flight to New York
Hit the L.Q. watch RED spin, "IT'S CLOSED"
Brooklyn strikes again

Heartbeat (scratch)

Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends

Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
Because I be layin' rhymes super sly, cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it

Listen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man
But that's natural, cause you know that I am
No punk, no chump, no fool, no toy
