* Ice-T does NOT rap in this song

[Ice-T {Aki-La in background}]
Yeah
Yo, welcome to the city of Los Angeles
Westside
Coldest, fastest city on the face of the map
South Central L.A
I know you from out of town, but
Just snuggle up next to me
We gon' go for a ride all around (All y'all out there, listenin')
Round and round (I got you)
See the sights, see the lights, it's Ice-T tonight, baby
Now I know you from Japan (That's right)
And Aki-la, you know I know this city
Aki-la, you know you down
Like drugs
Violence
Gang bangin' and drama
It's real
Get ya crazy out here at times
A lot of people die
Lot of people wanna know why, but hey
That's Los Angeles {Come with us}
Call it City Of Angels {If you have a dangerous mind}

[Verse 1: Aki-La]
I'm used to chilling, baby
In a middle of the big city
Time after time
Nothing changed
Here in L.A
I have been looking for somewhere
I have been searching for someone
Blow my pride

Chorus: Aki-la
I came here to see real street in L.A
I fly 5000 miles away from J to
Party with fly guy, player Ice-T
Come and take me
I am ready for the west side

[Repeat Chorus]

[Aki-La] Round and round and round and round and round and round
[Ice-T]  You rollin' with Iceberg, to fine the love in the game

(Verse 2)
[Aki-La] I was waiting, baby
To get sweat on my body with you
For this party cruse
Here in L.A
If you know, who you are
Come over, join with us
We cruise
Hollywood
To feel real life
Vibe so slow
I have been
Looking for
[Ice-T]  And I've been looking for you, baby
The coldest girl in all of Japan
Me and you, baby, it's gonna be big
Aki-La and Ice Man
You know that's fly
Come on
[Aki-La] I have been searching for
[Ice-T]  And I've been searching for you all of my life
[Aki-La] Ikitsuku tokoro
Out of control

[Repeat Chorus] Twice

Bridge: Aki-La
Round and round and round and round and round
Miageta sora
Itsumo hiroku
Todokanu yume ga unda tameiki
Ten to deru ka chi to deru ka futta
Daisu ni kakeru yukisaki
Livin in L.A
Like a super star
You never know
Don't know, no, no

[Ice-T]  Ice, baby
[Aki-La] Mmm, don't know, no, no

[Repeat Chorus] Twice

[Aki-La] I came here to see real street in L.A
[Ice-T]  And I'm ready for you
[Aki-La] I came here to see real street in L.A
[Ice-T]  We gon' make so much money, it's gon' be crazy, large like an oil barge

[Repeat Chorus]

[Ice-T (Aki-La in background)]
Snuggle up close to me, you gon' be okay
It's where I'm from (Ready for the westside)
B.B.R.I
Round and round
Yeah, we goin' round and round
Yeah (Ready for the westside)
Let's put up the vibe
It's gon' be okay
Talkin' crazy
Having money
All them lowriders out there, y'all know she's fly
You wish she was in the front seat with you (Ready for the westside...)
Dippin' the switches
