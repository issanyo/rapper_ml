I sold too much coke in the eighties
It's my fuckin' fault, I made you crack babies
Now you whine and cold woke me up
Like a wild wolf won't murder his sick pup
Niggas on the net talkin' crazy and reckless
Busters don't know you get laid down for much less
This ain't no game, cuz niggas now we come
.50 cal dum-dum, rubber-grip bear guns
I see you run like diarrhea
Hide behind your fucking bodyguards like little ballerinas
It ain't no thing when them damn things flame
Fully automatic makes the clubs' ears ring
The oldest nigga, true, that means I done it the most
Question is now which pussy want it the most?
Y'all ain't shit to me, never got your G on
Softer than the pillows at the Bed, Bath & Beyond
Your mistake thinking that I'm dead and gone
Ask your mama, I'm bloody in the octagon
I'm iller than Chucky in Child's play
I bench 300 on a bad day
I'm wild like Uganda machetes
You motherfucking with a psychopath, you niggas ain't ready
Cracked my nigga T.I., but they didn't catch me
My silenced P90 sounds like sewing machines
Bugatti Veyron, Plasma Screen
Malibu beach house, lake house, I'm caked out
I come in all blue, I don't know red
And, I don't know throw dough, I make it rain lead
Coked out, I'm boiling bricks in the kitchen
I don't matter If you got it, nigga. Tricking is tricking
Algebraic, I multiply my metaphors
I'm so spa from deep tissues and pedicures
Overload of niggas in ski masks
Westside rider for life, you ain't gotta ask
L.A., home of the triple beam
My niggas run all up in your crib like a S.W.A.T. team
I'll make your SUV lean
Full metal jackets have it rockin' like a raft in rapids
The last nigga in life that you want to meet
Keep talkin' shit on the net, I'll see you in the streets
