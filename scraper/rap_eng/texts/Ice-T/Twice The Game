[Intro: Ice-T]
Yeah
DJ Ace
Iceberg nigga
Gangsta shit
Niggas out there running their mother fucking mouth
Acting like bangers
Acting without sad cards
Like somebody supposed to be afraid

[Hook: Ice-T]
You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
Twice the heart nigga look in my eyes
L.A. gang-banging, to the streets I'm wise
Notice a novice when it comes to the guns
I never flash, just reach and blast
Chrome hydraulics and the black ski mask
Your next decision might be your last
Real niggas fed the fuck up with the fakes
Think about the next move you make nigga

[Hook: Ice-T]
You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
Fame
Motherfuckers want it so bad
Give away every fucking piece of soul they had
Lie to themselves and they lie on the pad
Its a motherfucking hip-hop fad
Get gangster, get gully, get raw
Talk about shit that you never fucking saw
Well the streets talk
They say they need to holler at you
You go to jail, you got problems there too
That's the drama that comes with fakeness
Body guard niggas straight making me laugh
Forty niggas in your entourage, all of them fags
The real nigga in your crew straight extorting your cash
Who am I talking to?
Half you rap whores
Rolling with the cops talking all about your hardocore
No names needed, everybody knows
The real niggas in the game, and the straight hoes

[Hook: Ice-T]
You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
These streets got a problem with you
They say the shit you say on your records ain't true
They say that you're talking about people that you never knew
It's a gimmick niggas see right through
They want a little cash back for the lives you stole
They say they'll take it back in your blood and your gold
More body guards, more steel plates
In the doors of your cars and your SUVs
You know you got real problems 'cause you're fucking with Gs
You got the fake gangster rapper disease
Keep lying nigga, digging your grave
Claiming how you bust guns when you know you're bitch made
Your whole posse knows nigga, when will you learn
They're looking at your bankroll, laying the turn
You wanna be a gangster but forgot one thing
Gangsters get murdered or they die in the bing

[Hook: Ice-T]
You faggots don't scare me, I'm twice as cold
Niggas can't tell me shit, I'm twice as old
Fuck how much you sold, I got twice the cash
Fuck how raw you are, I blast twice as fast
No matter how fly you get, I get  twice as smooth
No matter how slick you are, I got twice the moves
Fuck how big you get, I got twice the fame
One word Iceberg, that means twice the game

[Outro: Ice-T]
XMG
Get to your stylist
Get your gansta wardrobe put together
Put on your makeup
Come out and do your video
Rented cars, rented hoes, rented houses
Fake guns
Fake lifestyles
MTV Cribs
That ain't even your house nigga
You got to practice what you preach
Talk the talk, you gotta walk the walk
Street niggas wanna talk to you kid
Talk to you face to face
Your bodyguard's homosexual anyway
Fat ass nigga
Iceberg
The truth kid
