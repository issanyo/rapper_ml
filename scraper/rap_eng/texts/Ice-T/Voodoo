[Verse 1]
Way down in New Orleans, yeah
I met this old lady
She said she'd teach me 'bout Voodoo
She said she knew about Voodoo
She said she'd teach me 'bout Voodoo
She said she knew about Voodoo
She had an old doll
She had a long shiny needle
She held the doll in the air
It looked kinda like me
She took the needle
Stuck it in its eye!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
My eye, bitch!

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Now I'm still in the room with this crazy bitch
And she still had the doll
She said I'll teach you 'bout Voodoo
You wanna learn about Voodoo
She said I'll teach you 'bout Voodoo
She said she knew about Voodoo
She held the doll in her hand
She had some long shiny scissors
She said some magic words
The doll looked more and more like me
She held the doll in the air
She took the scissors
Cut off all its fingers!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
My fingers, bitch!

[Solo/Bridge]
Voodoo, Voodoo
Voodoo, Voodoo

[Outro]
So if you're ever down in New Orleans, yeah
You might meet an old lady
She might have a doll
It might look like you
Don't ask about the Voodoo
Stay away from Voodoo
Leave alone the Voodoo
Motherfuck the Voodoo
