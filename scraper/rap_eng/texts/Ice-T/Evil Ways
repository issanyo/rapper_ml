[Verse 1: Freddy Cricien]
Evil never dies
It resides inside us
Right beside
Where angels are
If you awaken that beast
Hell will soon be unleashed
In violent times
Conditioned minds
Will cross the line
Compassion's dying
When you awaken that beast
Death follows, hell follows

[Chorus: Freddy Cricien]
Hate - all around us
Wait - I think it found us
Hate - all around
It's home it found us
Hate - all around us
Wait - I think it found us
Hate - all around
It's home it found us

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
I'm not the one you want to fuck with or test
I'm merciless, don't cross the line
Unleash the evil, now you have
Breathed your last breath, caused your own death

[Chorus: Freddy Cricien]
All around us
Wait - I think it found us
Hate - all around
It's home it found us
Hate - all around us
Wait - I think it found us
Hate - it's found its way to me

(Evil ways)

[Bridge: Freddy Cricien & Ice-T]
These motherfuckers ain't sick, just evil
Not mentally ill, just evil
You're killing fucking kids, just evil
You're a piece of shit, hell awaits

I hear the gunshots, bodies are dropping
Sons and daughters of sons and daughters, no stopping
I hear the pop pop pop, bodies are dropping
It's getting closer and closer, you can't stop it

These motherfuckers ain't sick, just evil
Not mentally ill, evil ways
You're killing fucking kids, just evil
It's getting closer and closer, can't stop it
