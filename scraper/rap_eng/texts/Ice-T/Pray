[Intro]
Yah you know
Niggas don't really want drama
I'm just trying to live
Go out, hang out, have a little fun
Shit always gets wild, always

[Verse 1]
Its Saturday night
I'm rolling with my bitch and my niggas
Well known ghetto-grown Glock rocking street figures
Their cars trailing
I'm rolling in the front with my bitch for life
You can call her my wife
The four in the back in the blacked out 'lac
They high off the yak and they dusted too
Streets call 'em killers but I call them my crew
Some niggas wear red, my niggas wear blue
Step through the door, niggas can't help but feel us
Faggots tuck their jewels, bitches trying to see us
Led us to the back, put us up in a booth
Got vodka and cran, Jagermeifer to shoot
Coco started dancing, everything was fine
'Til some nigga said that table was supposed to be mine
I was feeling good, ain't paying him no mind
'Til the nigga got wild, threw a bottle of wine

[Bridge]
3, 2, mother
3, 2, father
3, 2, sister
3, 2, brother
No time to pray

[Verse 2]
The shit just missed me and my niggas kicked in
Blade swing the razor and he opened his skin
These niggas wasn't having it, gangstas too
Mother fuckers started shooting, lighting up the room
(?) wore a vest and it went right through
They bodied Big Wrench, what the fuck Imma do?
Flip the table up, me and Coco hit the back door
These niggas wasn't done, these niggas want more
Fell off in the cut like a video game
Pulled my strap took my aim, make the door my frame
Everybody that stepped out, that body got flamed
I knew I was bleeding, I could feel the pain
Broke out, had to get behind the wheel
Running through the parking lot, Coc broke her heel
I started getting dizzy as I clenched my gat
I made it to my whip, I was shot in the back

[Bridge]
3, 2, mother
3, 2, father
3, 2, sister
3, 2, brother
No time to pray

Jumped in the car, laid across the backseat
Coc grabbed the wheel, I was really starting to leak
Halfway out the lock got blocked, its back on
Some niggas in a blue Seville with a grill
Hopped in the stash by going for dolo
Its  extra big but it packs a fully auto
Blast through my own glass, should have heard the sound
It was on bitch, no time to roll shit down
Hit the corner, see my niggas Smitty and Mick
The was rolling toward the club when they heard 'bout the shit
Didn't have to tell 'em they just a block up the street
Cops on the way, still ain't throwing my heat
Don't even know why the fuck I'm out here dealing with beef
Just went out for some drinks in the club with my peeps
My two boys are dead, I seen 'em fall at my feet
And I'm shot the fuck up bleeding all on my seat
