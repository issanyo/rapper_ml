[Intro]
And it goes, and it goes
And it goes a little something like this
Hit It!
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
I wanna make it back
Here we go
Aaron's in the house
Get up get up
I wanna make it back

[Verse 1]
Yo guys, check out, guess what happened to me
(Another crazy story, come on AC)
I was hanging at the court, just playing some ball
Working on my game (yeah, we heard it all)
I heard the fans screaming, I thought it was for me
But then I saw a shadow, it was 12 foot 3
It was Shaquille O'Neal (what? What did he say?)
(How 'bout some one-on-one, you wanna play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad, try not to cry
(Please Aaron, are you for real?
One-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal?)
Yeah, 34 center from the L.A. Lakers
(You must've been nervous) I knew I could take him
Stared at Shaq, psyche him out
I said O'Neal, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes

[Chorus]
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

[Verse 2]
So check it out, I thought I had the lead
But then he started scoring mad points on me
I was scorin' the bricks (was he hitting all the shots?)
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop
I had a plan, I could change the pace
I said, "Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace"
He looked down, I stole the ball
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3-pointer, nothing but net
Come on Shaq, had enough yet?
Down by two, I'm catching up
I guess you're getting nervous 'cause you already lost

[Chorus]
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
It's like boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq

[Bridge]
Dunk after dunk, jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering (Aaron's the man)
Dunk after dunk, jam after jam
Cheerleaders are cheering (Aaron's the man)

[Verse 3]
Announcers were shocked, couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)
One more second, was all that remained
I put the ball up, I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
But the ball went in, then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shaq, I should've let you win
You're good too and we can still be friends
The fans went nuts, they put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice and it sounded like my mother's
(Get up for school, you're gonna be late)
Ma, can't you see that I'm playing a game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me
If it was a dream and it wasn't real
How'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal? Woah

[Chorus]
Boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
Boom (boom)
I put it in the hoop
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming
Out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shaq
