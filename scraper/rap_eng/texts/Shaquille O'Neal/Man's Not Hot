[Intro: Shaquille O'Neal, Big Shaq]
It's not Roadman Shaq, I'm Big Shaq
There's a lot of people that are named after me
Shaquille, Shaq
But keep in mind, there's only one Big Shaq, it is I
The originator, the dominator, the creator
Don't you ever call your name Big Shaq
Last man who called themselves Superman still ain't got no rings
Roadman Shaq

[Verse 1: Shaquille O'Neal]
Find me swiping the black card
I got a lake in the backyard
I got 'gators, got snakes in the backyard
Superman on a Glock in the backyard
Even got a safe in the backyard
Got a 'Rari, Bentley in the backyard
I can tell when you spit, Roadman Shaq
You could never be me, you're not really a factor
I'm just in here, about to win
Ain't got to spin, whole lot of ends
See me been, Hall of Fame Shaq D's First Ballot, that's me, you know what spot I'm in
I ball like I gotta win
Don't care who I offend
Play real, do not pretend
I am not from this planet therefore I'm not your friend
Can't stop the reign, can't block the wind
Top on the dome when I drop the Benz
Drop a D you wanna jump in the ring and compete with these?
Negro please
Why you even talk to me?
You ain't the boss of me
You're softly hard for cheese
Emperor raise the temperature high degrees
Dot your I's, cross your T's
Hit them with a rapid flow
Why they acting like I've never rapped before?
Because I play a little bit of basketball
Then made a lot of bitty-bitty cash to blow
Pull up in your block in a Titanic
Rocks in the watch look gigantic
Move like a one man army
If you've got Shaq D's on your side then why panic?
Paparazzi with binoculars
TMZ got photographers
Mr. Redred red carpenter
ShaqD's is the one who they holler for
Don't you ever disrespect thy name
All I really got is my name
Diesel will spit that propane
Roadman Shaq, you should be ashamed
For saying

[Hook: Big Shaq]
The ting goes skrrrahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skibiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom
Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun
Poom, poom, yo
The ting goes skrrrahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skibiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom
Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun
Poom, poom, yo

[Verse 2: ShaqIsDope]
Look, listen your bars are ridiculous
You up on records and speak all this gibberish
Talking like "skrrrahh, pap, pap"
Now listen homeboy, we ain't hearing it
I got the call yeah, from the Big Diesel
Saw me rip the record, watch the kid eat you
Turns out you a actor boy
It's sick to be a like Vin Diesel
We don't got the same flow like you say no
When I bodied you already, yeah tell 'em case closed
Only other Shaq as long as the name goes
And I'm ending your career, that's how far your fame goes
I'm a real spitter man, yeah true form
Man's not hot, well you're just lukewarm
Diesel locked out, opened up a few doors
So I came for your life, what I had to do for him
Man I'm coming from the T Dot
Downtown where the street's hot
So my dog's gotta keep the pup
And I don't mean Shaq's Reeboks
Beast mode when the beat strap
Really dog? You should've listened
Plus I know you're from London
Go have your tea with the biscuits
I'm from the 'jects, I'm on a mission
Got you upset, 'bout to be finished
You just a mess, please stop spitting
Stick to the script and handle your business
Switch the flow, I'm in the zone
Me and you could never get along
Please never make another song
And if you do then it's really on
I'm in the stu', I got the tape dropping
Next month, bet you go cop it
Two up, man, they can't stop it
And I can't lose, there's no other option
This one gon' have the city rocking
It gon' shake them up and really get me popping
Turn this up, had the speakers knocking
Me and Big Diesel got the streets talking
Woah
