[Verse 1:]
Imagine yourself in my shoes
Close your eyes and get up in it
And picture how it feels to be a king for a minute
Now feel it, Porsches, Benzes
Piles is endless
It's never hard to tell who my crew of trigger mens is
Players, Pepsi, and dimes all around
Plus your tightie suits cut and shines by the pound
I'm down for your crew to come to my crib and play
Wake up, and fly to Canc√∫n the next day
I'll fuel my jet, you can go get your clan
No need for luggage, we can shop when we land
In this era, there's no half-stepping in my circle
Try to get out that, I doubt that, I'll hurt you
Player haters linger, this Basketball swinger
Staring at my grandmother's ring on my finger
Black tire, fair, my suit? No need to get it
I can rock my triagem jeans and be player most sweated
So debt it, let it go, my doors go to swing up more
Ice on my watch than in your block in December
And Rico Gonzales
Quick to take your honey on a trip around the world
That's Spanish Laker money

[Hook]
You can't stop the reign (you can't stop the reign, no)
When it starts to fall (when it start to fall..)
There's no one else to blame (no one else to blame..)
You can't unlock that door
Player haters stay strong
But they still can't stop the reign (can't stop, won't stop!)
They can try to feel my style, but all they ever feel is pain
And from the east to the west, all I ever did is lay it down
And there's a reason all the [?] is still around, now get down
