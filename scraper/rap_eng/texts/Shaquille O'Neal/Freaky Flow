[Scratch Hook]
Gotta freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky flow

[Verse One: Mr. Ruffneck]
I must represent for my people
Call it the sequel when I flip scripts with Shaq Diesel
It's the Missing Links, what did you think?
Surprise
Bloodshot eyes, from the buddah guys
From the depths of my soul I bring the realness
For real it's
Ruffneck with the funk check, can you feel this?
Ill
Chyskillz mix
[?]
I can make your mama turn tricks
No pun intended
Right hand extended
Followed by the left, I've asked for the DJ's to blend it
In '95 I'm taking over, never sober
So ease back or go out like a kamikaze soldier

[Verse Two: General Sha]

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Shaq]
I'm causing helter, skelter, MC's run for shelter
I'm the only big dog, [?]
So go get your camera, snap, swing bats like Reggie Jack'
The World Is Mine punk so welcome to Planet Shaq
Disobey my rules you'll meet my fists of fury
Shaq da poom ping, now your vision's blurry
My TWISM theory, staying real to never snitch
My clique, full of hoopers, no female dogs bitch
[?]
Click clack
That's the sound of backs, that I'm breaking
Shaq O'neal has awakened
MC's heart that I'm taking
I'm not faking
Don't be mistaken
Just tickle me pink
Shaq O'neal
Dredsta
Missing Links
