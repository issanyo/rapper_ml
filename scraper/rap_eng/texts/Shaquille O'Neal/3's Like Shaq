[Intro]
Aye, wassup man?
Shouts out to B-Dawg and all of them, you feel me?
Shouts out to Tony Mayo, shouts out to all my dudes
(Shout out 12 Gauge, shout out Kalvin Tomato)
We stay on those courts boy, we stay in these streets
You know who my favorite basketball player of all time is?
The best 3 point shooter ever
That's Shaq, boy!

[Verse 1]
I'm makin 3's like Shaq, yeah
Aim my shit right at yo back, yeah
You gone have a heart attack, yeah
Imma make yo lungs collapse, yeah
Aim my shit right to yo brain,
You can't talk to me cuz you a lame,
Bitch ass just stay in yo lane,
Can't fuck with us bitch we insane,
I'm makin 3's like Shaquille,
I'm in this shit for the kill,
Bitch you ain't eatin our meals,
Fuck workin bitch imma steal,
I feel like I'm in my 30's,
You know I'm sippin that dirty,
All of these bitches be flirty,
Cuz they know my dick is girthy

[Bridge]
I got that 22 like Shaq's shoe size that 22,
Fuck Kobe, fuck Jordan, fuck you too,
Op pulled me over told me put the drugs up on the dash,
Turned out it was Sheriff Shaq he knew I had white like Steve Nash

[Verse 2]
But it's all good I told him I ain't with the Lakers either,
Then he asked if I had weapons I said, "no heat no fever",
He said cool then he hopped back in his Lamborghini,
Then I pulled out some green and I talkin bout zucchini,
Fuck...I feel just like Art Long,
But I wanna be like my boy Shaq and endorse some Gold Bond,
Damn...Shaq an Icy Hot man,
With his own damn can,
Tell me, who else can do that man?

Not you! (x16)

[Outro]
I'm makin 3's like Shaq (x8)
