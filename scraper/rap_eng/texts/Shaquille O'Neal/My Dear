Chorus 4X: Shaq & {Warren G}
I wanna girl like my dear yea
{Tall, slender, brown eyes with the slick black hair}

[Verse One: Shaq]
I wanna girl like my dear, that's my mom dukes
Someone to kick back with no fake no juice
Beautiful cars cool collective
Settle down chill out that's my objective check it
My game put my on the map at first base
Make up like cake in your face just ain't my taste
Some girls try to play me but yo I find another
Because I gots that crazy game and I'll make like my mother
Now simply speakin I'm like I'm tweekin
My buisness never leak in the street
The packin is so complete, like 7-up I never had it but maybe I will
In need a women that reminds me of Lucille, my dear yea

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Shaq]
Let's get it on I've been feeling down
Baby know maybe you can help me out
I ain't too proud to beg for some advice
Let the good times roll in the heat ofthe night
I'm supafly TNT Shaquille O'Neal
Reach out for me I'll be there you know the deal
Now ain't that peculair I found a wonder full one
Ain't nothing like the ral thing buggin out having fun
A man will always be a man he sippin on bacardi I understand
So let me stick to drinkin up these Pepsi joints
Dunkin, actin and rackin up these points
I look over I see you in the stands
I'm showing off actin a fool for you and my fans
I put my peace sign high up in the air
I think I found a girl just like my dear yea

Chorus:

[Verse Three: Warren G]
Ahhh a brand new verse to smoke as I'm ??? all the way
Cuz this DJ is kickin up dust from the urban Eastside
Twenty-First street and Louis that's where my funk ride
Chillin with my man Shaq Diesel, cock diesel
Yes it's me Warren jiggy jiggy G'z
So G-funk, we funk till the end of our lives
With respect for our mamas Miss Dee is right

[Verse Four: Shaq]
I'm glad I found that significant other
She remind me of my mother cuz yo there ain't no other
I treat her right like father MC
Cuz I check Ralph Tresvant for "Sensitivity"
Behind every great man is a great woman
I keep it commin baby baby I keep it comin
And you don't have to worry about a thang
Cuz living in the fast lane just ain't my thang
Peace to Lucille and Miss Ola May
Cuz women of today like to play what can I say
I'm glad I found me a girl that's real
She reminds me of my number one baby Lucille yea
