[Verse 1]
I was born three-six-seventy-two, I think it's on a Wednesday
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go
Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys 'R' Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin' push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, "Good, now you gotta go
Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole."
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, "I can't let them down"
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

[Interlude]
I'm outstanding

[Verse 2]
Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house, no, Shaq is on the scene!
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model, I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?
My dream is coming true, but coming true slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
"Remember this, son, you are the one
Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
You're young, gifted, and Black
If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, Shaq!'"
Like the fam do, in the stands too
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, "Ahhh! Oooh!"
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's
Time for me to fulfill my dream
To be in the [leaders' game?] like Hakeem
I'll make the backboards shatter
Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other centers get madder
That's me, who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding

[Interlude]
I'm outstanding

[Verse 3]
Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly, "Swish!"
Cause there's some things that I gotta do:
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up and down the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop
Gotta keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta go! And I'm out andâ€¦
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends and fam
I'm outstanding

[Outro]
I'm outstanding
