You know, it's one thing to say something that's controversial, but it's another thing to say something that's very repugnant. The question is now, should this guy continue being an owner? That's the question. Should this guy continue being an owner? You know, everyone has their thoughts, you know everyone has their opinions, but you know, when your opinions and your thoughts become public knowledge, the question is... now what? And then another question is, will his team shut down on him? Will his team take these remarks personally and say 'you know what, we don't want to play for a guy like this'? It's an unfortunate situation but I think the league needs to take a very long, hard look on whether this guy should continue being an owner or not.

You can read these statements over and over. You can read the story over and over and you still cannot believe what you're reading.

Charles Barkley

Well first of all, you can believe it, 'cause this has happened before. He settled a lawsuit years ago, he obviously owns a lot of land and things also... and he settled a lawsuit that said he was discriminating against blacks and Hispanics. So this is habitual. This is the first test of Adam Silver. He's got to suspend him right now. First of all, they've got to prove it's his voice on the tape. But this is the first big test of Adam Silver. You can't have this guy making statements like that. He has to suspend him and fine him immediately. He has to be suspended. You know, Ernie, and the problem I have with it... if somebody wants to be racist, that's alright. That's their thing. But when you're in the position of power, and you can take jobs and economic opportunity from people, that's what crosses the line. But we cannot have an NBA owner discriminating against a league that - we're a black league, Ernie. We are a black league. I don't know the number but I'd probably say 80% of our players are black.

Ernie Johnson Jr.

How do you take this, as a player?

Charles Barkley

Well, that's a different animal there.

Kenny Smith

I just think, firstly, that you know, racism is like a refuge for ignorance. And I think there's two things that we can take from it. And the first, I would say, is that he's taking his primitive thought process and saying 'hey, I can work with you... or you can work for me, but I can't be associated with you'. Or, obviously 'you can be my girlfriend', obviously, because she's black and Mexican as well. So it's just a refuge for ignorance. I think it's more for me as a teaching tool for the new generation. Because the new generation of players, new generation of - I call it "new wealth" African Americans can take this as an educational standpoint, and say 'how do you deal with people like this who still have this kind of Jim Crow thought process'? And that's really where - but yes, he has to be suspended. And Magic Johnson came out and tweeted and said he'd never go to another Clipper game. I can totally understand that. And I can understand people who wouldn't support the Clippers at this point. Because he is the voice, and he's taken the ownership of a team a little bit too seriously.


Charles Barkley

Ernie, let me say this. First of all, I think it's unfair - this is a Donald Sterling thing, this is not a Clipper thing. We have to separate the two because there's Doc Rivers, Blake, Chris Paul - that's their team. He owns the team, but we're not thinking about who owns the team as a player. We don't care who owns the team.

Ernie Johnson Jr.

But aren't you, in this situation, saying - well, look at the guy who's signing our checks. Look what he has to say, and look how he feels about us. And that goes from Doc Rivers to Chris Paul, right down the line.

Charles Barkley

But the team can't say 'we're gonna shut down because our owner's a jackass'. That's not fair to the players.

Kenny Smith

I think the one thing as a player - and this is why I'm saying a teaching tool - is, you're a professional. And you have a craft, God-given, that you worked for. And you continue to do that craft to the best of your ability and knowledge. But when it comes time to re-sign with a team, that might be a team that you have second thoughts about playing with, because of the type of ownership.

Ernie Johnson Jr.

Or if you're a player in the league thinking about free agency.

Kenny Smith

Because my whole thing is, I am a professional and I put myself in this position - not Donald Sterling. So I have to perform to the greatest of my abilities. I have to coach at the greatest of my abilities. Now that I know what's on the other side of the fence, I know what to deal with at a later time.

Ernie Johnson Jr.

Word is, the Clippers have had a team meeting. No word on what exactly the result of that is. But they play tomorrow at Golden State. Do you make a message as a member of that Clipper team, or what is the reaction? What happens when you take the floor the next day?

Shaq

Well, you know, you still have to go out and do your job. Donald Sterling is one man, and I agree, Chuck - he owns the team. But there's a lot more at stake. Fans will be watching the game, you have a legitimate chance of winning a championship, and sometimes you have to go through trials and tribulations to get to where you want to go. And as a player, they should not let this discourage them or stop them from trying to win a championship.

Charles Barkley

And Ernie, listen. Your team is your team. You're not worried about who owns it. This is the first test for Adam Silver. He has to suspend this guy, he got to - cause like I said, this is habitual. He's already had the lawsuit for discrimination that he settled, so clearly he was doing something wrong. But this is the first big test of Adam Silver, and he's got to suspend this guy. He has to suspend this guy.

Ernie Johnson Jr.

And the NBA's investigation into this incident - into this recording - continues, and it has to be accurate. But I mean if it's true, and if it's him, there's no place in the NBA for Donald Sterling, in my mind.
