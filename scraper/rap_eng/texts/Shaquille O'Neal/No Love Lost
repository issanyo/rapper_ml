Beleive it or not, I love all playa hatas (bring it)
Ha ha ha ha
Cause ain't no love lost here baby
Say what you gotta say

[Lord Tariq]
People know me on these streets playa
I ain't new
Lookin' at me all funny while I'm countin' my money
Surpise
What I do is already legalized
Analyze what I toss across
There ain't no love lost

[Shaq]
Exuberant, change, cross, exilhurated
Flomboyant, but boncey on beat breaks, I'm animated
Now it's been stated, I'm lyrically enthusiastic
I'm dope like all east coast CDs wrapped through plastic
What's the meaning of life, y'all should know
In my lifetime I need a whole lotta dough, bro
No need to get zealous, you jealous, say you jealous
I spike on that --- like Monica Seles
I split a divine rhyme, exsquisite like some elegant wine
Here's a toast, the world is mine
I promise I'm a keep it punk
I represent the real hip-hop, I ain't no freakin' country bumpkin
Hooparistic, freakaristic, poetic frenzy with conception
I got more flavor than a mystic
Fringe benfit-ic, urging y'all to get wit it
Style postulates, now pause while you gets splitted
I'm not just taco, I'm the whole enchilado
Enter any center blowin' up like Desperado

L.A. to Bronx to Bekailen
Together we provide a ton of better on the way and
We rhyme related
Very under-estimated, that's why I'm winnin'
In this world of sins, steady grinning, money boss spendin'
Distanced from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influential
Spirtualy and mental, what you into I'd a been through
Preachin' my words and don't know it, you owe it
It shows you wanna be me but won't show it
Ain't nothin' changed but the playas
The game remains the same
I had a ten year run, hey, I can't complain
Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi
From the B.X., we ridin' to South Beach on jet ski
Play to survive, you ain't live, you just livin'
You breathin' a good one, but where I'm from y'all forbidden
Come around, bad decision, you'd rather be in prison
Ain't no duckin' when I'm delivering, won't be forgiver-in'
Layin' there shiverin, half the night
You gotta walk towards the light, everything is aight
Make sure, everything you endure stays tight
Big Shaq, Lord Tariq, Jay-Z outta sight

[Jay-Z]
People know me on these streets and the towns I been through
Looking at me, stay focused, I'm givin' 'em straight focus
Suprise, what I do is already legalized
Analyze how I floss across
Of course there ain't no love lost

Fo' sho', everything's for dough now
I flow, y'all gotta pay a little mo' now
It's platinum, nowadays we put the gold down
We stepped it up, y'all don't ever wanna showdown
Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the bets wild
Y'all don't like it, sue me
Got settled out
Ghettoed out, in the vehicle bent
These days I mellowed out
See, success make a fella content
Un huh
You know, this rap stuff, pop a ???
Jay-Z hugo, course playa, you lost playa
I know you rappers wanna see me fail
But quick to see a six-hundred S.L. B-12
Live wit it
Y'all got dough to get get it
I got mine
Your little bit of money couldn't stop mine
Your block time too high, too many hands in your pie
Seventy thirty, the ------ work for, work for me
Bottom line
