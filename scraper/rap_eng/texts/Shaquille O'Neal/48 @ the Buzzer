(Shaquille O'Neal)
Yo Clark give me some of that (*Scratch*)
(Shaq) uh-huh
(Clark, yeah, T.W.IsM. uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh Clockworld, here we go)

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Here's the proper set off, wet soft that's how my honeys get
Never personal baby I ain't the one to trip
Nuthin but G'z when I come to get
Not like fake emcees who walk around broke with a money clip
Quite confusin ain't it?
They try to fool a brother
They never pass 8th grade and wanna sue a brother
Just select a view got boo
Cause only two people in this world I trust me and not you
Don't admire me and the guideline play by the rules
Follow step by step and life's kinda cool
About getting dough you shouldn't joke
Cause ain't nothing funny about waking up good and broke
I wasn't born filthy I remember poor
A lot of cats' front used to be poor before
Now only poor rhymes up in my cup off
Way to wash those linen clothes before you pour

(Chorus)
(Clark Kent)
I give all except that
You gotta accept that
For this money or the honey
She won't respect that
For my dogs where you rest at
No set backs CK, BK
The Bricks City now check that

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Don't like surprise now do my thing up upon the regular
Behind my O's changing comma suit ecetera
A lot of cake proof not a fake
Until then act like a broke mirror and stay out my face
That is stinking if you thinking that I can't flow
A penny for you thought left that in Orlando
Your man know I'm unstoppable when it's hot
Even hotter than the Sun's ?whip cream? to stop
Hotter than Jordan when he hit Clive for 35
In the first half alone in my microphone
It's hotter than a heater hotter than Satan with a fever
Hotter as Rakim follow the leader
Hotter than me all alone in a two seater
Of the puff joint hot as senorita
Twice as hot as a lion in the desert chasing a cheetah
Hot as a Clark beat when the sh.. hit the meter
(Chorus)
(Clark Kent)
I give all except that
You gotta accept that
For this money or the honey
She won't respect that
For my dogs where you rest at
No set backs CK, BK
The Bricks City now check that

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Watch your daughter Shaq's about to enter the fourth quarter
In the pink I'm water like H20
Take you slow in a flash make you know
How perfect a great cool flow let us stop it
Only profits allowed to speak on my companies
While your business is up and down like chumpy cheese
Know the reason why you come to me
Most likely wanna be me but will settle just to run with me
It's all good you know I'm ammune to all your gas
I run an option like war and mood then I pass
I don't rush the trust I must discuss
Those two pockets rush can't run with us
One way or another know my style I don't show nuttin
Catch me all on your grill like you own something
Three quarters of them is fronting up in the mix
And pissing in the wind broke beyond fix so what

(Chorus)
(Clark Kent)
I give all except that
You gotta accept that
For this money or the honey
She won't respect that
For my dogs where you rest at
No set backs CK, BK
The Bricks City now check that
