Intro: Shaq

Yo yo
This jam right here dedicated to all the little bad knuckleheads runnin'
Around
Gettin' in trouble
Just follow your dreams and you'll be aight


Hook: Peter Gunz

Yo it was all a dream
Deprising and uprising my schemes
But suprising realzing that
Yo it was all a dream
I kept my head above the water for cream
But now I'm turnin' all heads when I step on the scene
(yesterday it was just a dream
Never thought this could ever happen to me)
It was all a dream
(how a change came around in my life)


Verse 1: Shaq

I went back and forth from ??? to chilltown JC
At first it's just me and mommy
Then Phil came along, he bought a basketball go to the park
Get your game on Shaq but have your butt back by dark
I was acting like the doc, my game was the joint
Dribbilin' between my legs like Norm Nixon at the point
Materalism kept them other kids biz'm
While I was selling my game they was sellin' izm
Words by Phil be a leader not a follwa
Don't let the masses of technolgy swallow ya
La di da di we all likes to party
I'm followin' my dreams I'm gonna be somebody


Hook


Verse 2: Shaq

Now check it, Commodores was my favorite joint
Til I heard Planet Rock on the bop, that jam's on point
I used to rhyme in the mirror, like I was down with UTFO
Doug E. Fresh singin' a show
For a big kid I had crazy rythm
Size 13 suede crews with thick shoe strings in 'em
I was the baddest popa, baddest rhyme dropper
Bustin' more mills than Superman to helicopters
I had the name buckle kids used to jock
Public Enemy came out, I had the clock
My favorite jam was by Big Daddy ain't no half steppa
My mic sounds nice check 1-2 by Salt N' Pepa
Heavy D, Rakim, Eric B, Ricky D
Scott LaRock and BDP
I never knew 'em but I used to look up to 'em
Battles in the park in the dark I ran through 'em


Hook


Verse 3: Shaq

Somebody wake me up this can't be real
Lookin' in the paper, Shaq's about to make a hundred mil
Somebody smack me, it's gotta be fake
20,000 square foot crib on the back of a lake
Five movie deal with Disney
Damn I'm getting busy like Dizzy Calepsi
20 mil check from Pepsi
Let's see, red benz and black porsche
??? room suburban with roof-top hole and of course
Boat with my name on the side so I can ride on the water
With my wife and my baby daughter
I oughta write a book so y'all can see
How easy it is to be who the hell you wanna be
This is a message from Shaq, react bring it on back
Follow your dreams and it's like that
