(Shaquille O'Neal)
Enter the mind of a rhyme extroadinaire
Opposition crumbles under the wear and tear
I'm slamin emcees like Ric Flair
Chillin in the city where it's sunny but the Mic I don't share
So if you step up like a stair it's guaranteed to get hectic
Cause my style is electric like the chair
Whoever wanna test just STOP!
Before you catch the diamond in the back with the sun roof top
If you come on stage you get got
I think I need to stop droppin roll cause I'm burnin hot
Stay grounded keep my visual pointed to the sky
Lyrical wise keep your eardrums high my CD's you must buy
Sky rocket in pocket and my publishin points and politics
My Benz is straight strugglin, bubblin like about on the moat
Control crowds with the flow melt the Mic like snow to get the dough

(Chorus)
(J-Flex)
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Timber the room I need space give me mad BOOM
Blowin up the spot like you blow up the bathroom
Like a lady with a bad womb brothers in producin
I got the noose around your neck and I won't loosen
Style biters title gets took like barge fighters
Barney Rubble bomb tracks nobody can come tighter
I came to make meals and came to peel grills
The secret of my style is concealed I still real
You ?overcome? with comics with phonics
And under M-I-C I'm a black belt with the fifth degree
Came to California horney-a didn't know
Got a sack full of rhymes and I'm ready to unload
Fly like an eagle or a superhero
Watchin over the ghetto smashin the gas pedal to the floor
I'm even movin like a world tour
Opportunity knocked so I kick down the door

(Chorus)
(J-Flex)
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss

(Shaquille O'Neal)
My X-ray vision see right through your skis
You got pinto pockets and Cadillac dreams
And no game plan to put the cash in your hand
So ya grab your Glock and try to take it from the next man
No doubt the ruckus you took out like shout
With somebody quick on the draw see what you about
I chose to make my fortune from Mic scorchin
Leavin emcees stuck like two dogs in a coarsen
I save the day with eighty ways to slay
All I need is the pad eight pens to pave the way
If you want to pursue then do what you gotta do
And I'll knock your...into two thousand-two
You'll be time travellin throw a bird javelin
Nice, precise think twice before you're battlin (WHY?)
Cause in your city zone I pimp words like pretty Tone
The street corner is no microphone

(Chorus)
(J-Flex)
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot (say what?)
I grab the steel with the grime on the top
When the steel is in my fist emcees get caught up in the twist (everybody know)
Lyricist with actin with styles that don't miss (Shaq supaman)
