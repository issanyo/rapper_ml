Yo Kenny tell Clark I need another hit
Yeah Brick City wha-wha-wha-wha to Beverly Hills
Yeah, yeah the world is mine T.W.IsM
Clockworld yeah Sonja Blade once again
Another hit Sauce Money uh-huh yeah
Peter Gunz check it yeah T.W.IsM. fam
Check it

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Aiyyo heaven put on a lock of a life of a seven-footer
Never catch me in the back runnin wit dem
Like my chicks stickin gorgeous a stun in a slim
Rap style like black cobra comin in a gym
I consider y'all whack its Shaq that did it all
Everybody gotta go soon as I hit the mall
Takin my time when I shop could ya meet
Waiting inline every state I escape with a dime (word up)
Hatin to find out no data is so greater
Been purping the goal from LSU to Omega
Gotta respect that funky beats don't even sweat that
Clark got that with a hot track forever see
Which is me you'll probably never be
Besides I'm too mental like Celebrity
Plus you just begin a stack when it's whack
Shaq blow the whistle cause you bugging like Men in Black, what

("On the microphone, fiend")

(Shaquille O'Neal)
I'm the hottest thing spitting y'all............
Shaq D also better known as stack neat
Paper, cats can't understand my caper
Getting dough is like Nas right hand
Checking nature might resent me
Cause cash rule the chips represent me
See me breeze in a cream Bentley
Fronting in the sun that's two-seated
Believe it pull up to the light and now you looking defeated
Girl grilling my ice got you heated (yeah)
Yep beef with the nitty I never needed (wha-wha)
What fags are true I know what Mack's might do
I'm quite familiar with cats like you
Provoke to get me give me a good reason to smoke me
Try to break me but never wrote me
Take my bacon, number 1 I know you hate my reign
Guess what, can't stop the cake I'm making, T.W.IsM

("I was a fiend the fiend on the microphone")

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Uh-huh, hahahaha, yeah
One time T.W.IsM
The world belongs to ME

(Shaquille O'Neal)
I'm the official all star twice as hot as y'all are
Never catch me putting chrome on a small car
I'll buy four more that imagination could dream
Never drink coffee without tasting the cream
Like fill in the golf course Shaq making the green
Another way you'll be fronting playa hating my team
But you feel, still Shaquille O'Neal, real
Since I stacked the deck thick now here's the deal
I pound hard to the ground and make you canopy seen boo
Can't believe the dimes I'm romantically laid too
I think you should relax and keep your heart
Wanna hit better try and get a beat from Clark
Wanna ball grab your jersey and act like you know me
Hit the forum and watch me catch the ooo from Kobe
For y'all punk squad I duck hard
After we fast brake I hit ya chicken make mad cake
