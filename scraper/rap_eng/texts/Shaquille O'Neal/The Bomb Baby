(Intro: N-Tyce)
Uh, yeah Deadly Venoms up in here with Shaq
(It's the world's, world's greatest lyricist)
We about to freak up on this track
Like, like this...

(J-Boo)
I bring heat to any tracks storm lay down
J to the B double O hold the crown
Catch me on the rebound I'll put it down
Bang it hard than the underground you don't want it now

(N-Tyce)
I want wax like a candle
I'll be the chick you can't handle
Pretty feet check me out on sandals
Down even scandal on me too hot, hot
The way my crew rides baby girl tear em off the roof top

(Deadly Venoms)
Camillion get the party started
Make ya tear the club up
Back in retarded because I'm cold hearted
Step through the door gambino hard core mosquito
Keep on soaking you up like El Nino

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Yo gon respect me correctly
Got something to say do it indirectly
Baby check me a tall brother, chicks wanna call brother
The ball brother, lyrically never fall brother
I'll be in the club with the boys
Making noise on the regular
Mad chicks blowing up my cellular phone
Ain't nobody waiting for me at home
Ain't nobody scoring on me when I'm up in the zone

(N-Tyce)
Got a squeaky voice but I rhyme bold
Lyrically you can't see me like a blind fold I design so
Never try to touch my click, we too thick
We too quick, we too slick, pluck ya like a tooth pick

(J-Boo)
Been the one I swing the swords like an outlaw
Hard to the core you keep it real I'll keep it raw
I bounce back like black ninja's in attack
Quick to react while Shaq smash from the track

(Deadly Venoms)
All you real live[..] put your hands up
And all you fake[..] put em down
We don't clown, Venoms and Shaq step to you in a flash
Break like glass, quick to throw you back in the trash

(K-Raw)
You better step back
Hanging with Venoms out on neff rack
Shaq whack, nah ain't nobody yapping, nag
Got you enemy the way I master things
Need to change my name to "Worship Utility"
Even your grandma be feeling me

(Deadly Venoms)
When I'm tweaked out and time to snitch
Personalities peep my travesty
I'll smack it back into reality
That's what you get for thinking until I left that... stinking
You didn't know that I was peeping
Your whole scenario tipped the guards so
I brought you low my stylo hitting see-low you know how we go
Slam dunk just like Shaq guess whose back?
It's the Venoms snaking you fools, handle your business

(Chorus: N-Tyce)
We be the bomb baby catch this
Everybody on the worst list
Shaq'll put you on the guest list
Now the stress list Venom attack vaness this
Always making money yo bless this

(Deadly Venoms)
We got the Nine-tino yo who that?
Venom and Shaq true that
We'll break your back on and off the track
Pull your card like twenty-one black jacks
Smack that put it back in fact react
We'll be twisting your cap

(Deadly Venoms)
Trying to reach my destiny and get this currency
I worrying about a thing my brother got so much love for me
And plus I'm Daphne and devious
Take me serious the way me and my friend roll will leave you fearious

(N-Tyce)
Yo I sip it but not a chaser
Just to add some flavor
If anybody step I'll take em out like an eraser
The N dash T Y C E can't nobody see me
I don't eat meat but I love me some peanut butter
The male lover type of chick you want to meet your mother
I'm kind of sneaky at times, my mind though
My rhyme flow, guarantee you'll open every time yo

(Deadly Venoms)
Critical that's why I don't laugh hysterical
Cause it's pitiful[..] the wild like Mystikal
Damn, I mean really y'all know how to slam like O'Neal
Push back up like a rebel when appeal

(Deadly Venoms)
Yeah ya heard me Venoms this clear the premises
Grant your wishes and gave you four death kisses
Not privileges, spitting images, puffing Indians
I know your feeling this, what's spreading the point in this?

(J-Boo)
You know I'm thugging the 41st side is where I rest
Hit you with the venom take your very last breath
Who wanna flex, I'll bring it to ya all night
Four times four chicks with Shaq on the Mic

(Shaquille O'Neal)
It's the brainiac, rap maniac, Shaq
Standing seven feet tall when I slam on tracks
And reading inches with my Venoms on a mission (wha-wha-wha-wha)
Something major, gotta keep a count of my paper
Where I ball is my home so I score for the Lakers
Beware of ?the picture? cause it just might snake ya

(Chorus: N-Tyce)
We be the bomb baby catch this
Everybody on the worst list
Shaq'll put you on the guest list
Now the stress list Venom attack vaness this
Always making money yo bless this
Rhyme baby test this
Everybody on the worst list
Shaq'll put you on the guest list
Now the stress list Venom attack vaness this
Always making money yo bless this

(N-Tyce) We be the bomb baby
Hah yeah we be the bomb baby

(O'Neal) I be the bomb baby
(N-Tyce) We be the bomb baby
(O'Neal) I be the bomb baby
(N-Tyce) We be the bomb baby
(O'Neal) I be the bomb baby
(N-Tyce) We be the bomb baby
(O'Neal) I be the bomb baby
(N-Tyce) We be the bomb baby
(O'Neal) I be the bomb baby
(N-Tyce) We be the bomb baby

(Shaquille O'Neal)
I be the bomb baby

(Outro: Shaquille O'Neal)
Venoms, venoms
Beware of the Venoms, beware of the Venoms
Ready for attack, ready for attack
Big Shaq, Wu-Tang
T.W.IsM., Protect Ya Neck Records
Wha-wha-wha-wha, one love
The world is mine
