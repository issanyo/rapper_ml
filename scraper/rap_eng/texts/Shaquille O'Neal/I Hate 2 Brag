[Intro: Speaker 1 and Speaker 2]
— Hello?
— Hello?
— Hello?
— Hello?
— Let me speak to Def Jef
— Who's calling?
— I'm not talking to you, musty under-arm odour-breath! I wanna talk to Def Jef. Last song he did with Shaq, Shaq was pretty braggadocious. I want Shaq to be braggadocious all the way, know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
Once again, it's time to get braggadocious
The tall human being, that's right, Shaq-a-tocious
Check out my lyrical slam, slam
Watch me flim-flam-flam
My refractor click-clacks
I biggity-bish the bam-bam
Punk be sleepin' on my skills
Magic pay me mils and my bills
Now I should move to Beverly Hills (uh-oh)
Naw, I'm jokin'
Backboards are broken
I grab the cord to the mic and start chokin'
Like I can't breathe, runnin' out of breath
I dribble the microphone between my legs, right to left
I got my second wind now, you better back up
Shaq Attack up, it's gonna act up
Don't make me crack up
Those skills, I bring it
Alarm, already ringin'
I duh, duh, d– d– duh, now watch me ding it
I kick rhymes like a real rapper should
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good

[Hook]
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(You all can't ball! You all can't ball!)
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(I dribble the words like basketball to take the kids to bouncin')
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(You all can't ball! You all can't ball!)
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(I dribble the words like basketball to take the kids to bouncin')

[Verse 2]
(Oh, my darling, oh, my darling, oh…)
Ah, shut up!
And Phife and Q-Tip, am I smooth like butter?
The sweet, the sheer ferocity, runnin' right through me
I briggity-broke the backs of those who tried to do me
My game is mad agile, your fame is mad fragile
I shoot you with my lyrical tongue
Click-click [?]
I can flow like pee coming out you-know-what
Or some dookie, diarrhea coming out your butt
I'm nasty, disgusting, oh, my, pew-wee
I floats like a butterfly and sting like a bee
I kill Super Mario, Batman's back
Even the He-Man ain't got the powers like the Shaq Attack
(Who do you think you are?)
I'm a star
If it's in my checking account
Buy your moms the car
I end agony and silence the shame
(Man, you ain't all that!)
Brother, do you know my name?

[Hook]
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(You all can't ball! You all can't ball!)
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(I dribble the words like basketball to take the kids to bouncin')
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(You all can't ball! You all can't ball!)
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(I dribble the words like basketball to take the kids to bouncin')

[Interlude]
(Step in the jam and slam!)
(People playing basketball)
(Step in the jam and slam!)
(Step in the jam and slam!)

[Verse 3]
You know what? You better listen to the news
I'm dynamite and I write with a slow-burning fuse
I'm the lord of the underground, dunk, funk
Treat me like a big criss-cross, you better jump, punk
'Cause I'm Muhammad like Ali
I'm hot like tamale
I hang with Mr. Cooper, ask Ali
And my tall dog handsome, all that and some
And deuce your proposal, I want my ransom
I'm 100% like orange juice
Call me Shaq Brown
I feel like bustin' loose, watch out, the funky hooper
I eh– eh– eh– eh– eh–
Sorry, I made a blooper
Then I come back like [?]
You know I'm hard
For the Ninth Ward
Word to God
I'm cool like a breeze through the trees
Finished rapping, no autographs please

[Hook]
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(You all can't ball! You all can't ball!)
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(I dribble the words like basketball to take the kids to bouncin')
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(You all can't ball! You all can't ball!)
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
(I dribble the words like basketball to take the kids to bouncin')
