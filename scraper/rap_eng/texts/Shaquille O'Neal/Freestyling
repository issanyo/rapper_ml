Check it, you know how I be
Last week Kobe couldn't do without me
Ya know how I be
Last week Kobe couldn't do without me
I call myself big but I'm not as good as Biggie
I call myself big cuz I live next to Diddy
Excuse me, Diddy live next to me
So in the hood dawg I feel like B-I-G
Cuz if Biggie was still here, he would be right there
On Star Island in a mansion somewhere
Chillin sitting on about half a billion
Cuz me and gunz can buy shit that's half a billion
Forreal dawg now that's B-I-G
There ain't nobody in the world do it bigger than me
That's like a white boy trying to be more nigga than me
That's like a homeless cat having more figures than me
That's like Patrick Ewing having more rings than me
That's like rappers having..cars (inaudible) things than me
That's like you saying to yourself you better than me
That's like Kareem saying to himself he better than me
Now stop, think about that, it ain't about that
Its about B-I-G AKA Big Shaq
Now that's the difference between first and last place
Kobe, Nigga, Tell me how my ass taste
Okay, Kobe, Tell me how my ass taste
Okay, Everybody, Kobe Tell me how my ass taste
I'm a horse, Kobe ratted me out
That's why I'm getting divorced
He said Shaq gave a bitch a mil
I don't do that cause my name Shaquille
I love em, I don't leave em' I got a vasectomy
Now I can't breed them
Kobe How my ass taste
Everybody, Kobe how my ass taste
Yeah, you can't do without me Kobe
You can't do without me (repeat 2 times)
Everybody, Kobe, Tell how my ass taste (Collective) Yeah....
