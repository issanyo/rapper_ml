[Hook 1: Shaquille O'Neal and Phife Dawg]
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Yo, yo, I'm over here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm over here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm over here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Yo, yo, I'm over here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Phife Dawg, I'm over here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Get on the microphone and just rip the track

[Verse 1: Shaquille O'Neal]
"Who the hell is Shaq Attack?"
You'd better read the paper
Treat me like Biz Markie, you'd better catch a vapor
I've got mad props so why would you exploit
Punch you in your face like that kid from Detroit
Really, yo, you'd better ask MC Hammer 'bout this bad mama jama
Tall kid with the hoopa-hypa-lipta-gramma
Watch out, yo, it's time for MC bashin'
Got more loot than my man Johnny Cash and
I'm hard like a 360 twice jam
Ask Doctor Dr√© and Ed Lover who's the man
I'm sure they'll say me, brother please don't play me like a shrimp
Dunk it on your head then I'll point like Shawn Kemp
Don't need the drink crooked, I juice to get loose
My favorite cartoon is Bullwinkle the Moose
I'm 'bout to sting you like rubbing alcohol
Yes, yes, y'all, call me Ed Jones 'cause I'm too tall
Put the rhyme between my legs then I'll score
Never mind a whore, I wanna do a fat tour
Come freak the style that the big Michelle display
You know the style, that be my forte

[Hook 2: Phife Dawg and Shaquille O'Neal]
Hey Phife, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo, Phife, where ya at?
Hey, yo, I'm over here
Hey, yo, Phife, where ya at?
You know I'm over here
Yo, Phife, where ya at?
I'm over here
Phife Dawg, where ya at?
Hey, yo, I'm over here
Hey, yo, Phife, where ya at?
Phife Dawg is over here
Hey, yo, Phife, where ya at?
Hey, yo I'm over here
Get on the microphone and rip a funky track

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
It's the Phife and Shaq mission plus Shaheed's got the goods
Making rough daddy jams, knocking harder than wood
Make ya boogie with the fly Armstrong crew
Phife Dawg and Shaq Fu, this is how we do
Funky renditions there's no competiton
Split MC's apart as if their group was New Edition
Make MC's hush, stop, look and listen
It's hard to comprehend so they commence to remincising
Far from an amateur, microphone damager
End your whole career, beat down your manager
Never was a herb, kick you to the curb
There's more to my attitude than the city of Johannesburg
Styles are mean but this year they're even meaner
Carrying chips on my shoulder, so call me Sarafina
Guarantee [?] Martin pissin' and fartin'
Mess around with this and you'll be on a milk carton
MC's don't like me, I say tough titties
Blow up the spot like my man from Jersey City
People always askin', "Why is Phife so cocky?"
I gotta be good at something cause I can't play hockey
You know the status and the status is live
The first draft pick for the label called Jive

[Hook 3: Shaquille O'Neal and Phife Dawg]
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Hey, yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm right here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm over here
Yo, Big Shaq, where ya at?
Yo, Phife, I'm over here
Hey, yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm right here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Phife Dawg, I'm right here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm over here
You can't front on the track 'cause the track is fat

[Verse 3: Shaquille O'Neal]
Yo, here I am again, you'd better call the cops
Pump up your Reeboks and ya just don't stop
I got mad styles, you better sit and watch
I can kick it like, "Hee hee!"
Then I'll grab my crotch
Yo, it's 1993, I mean nineteen-ninety-Shaq
Whatever year it is, the Shaq will never slack
Giving mad shouts to my homies up in Newark
On and off the court, you know I do work

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg]
Peace to that dog and peace to this dog
Here comes the Phife Dawg, a.k.a the top dog
World's greatest five-footer, as if you didn't know
Rhymes are like the Lord's lessons, they constantly flow
MC's need to step on, you see how they [?]
As long as the mic's on, that's when I get my run on
Battle anybody, bring your whole crew
You want the short black eskimo, come see me in my igloo
Nasty like vomit, couldn't clean it with Comet
Psycho like the Lords, crazy like Onyx
Forget the he's and she's and concentrate just on the flow
Phife Dawg signing off, enjoy the rest of the show

[Hook 4: Shaquille O'Neal and Phife Dawg]
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo, Phife, where ya at?
I'm over here
Big Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo, Phife, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo, Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
3-D, where ya at?
He's over there
Big Chris, where ya at?
He's over there
Nick Ander, where ya at?
He's over there

[Outro: Phife Dawg and Shaquille O'Neal]
Yo, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out
Check it out, check it out
Yo, yo, yo, we got the ill-type flow
Yo, yo, yo, my man Tip, where ya at?
Shaheed is in the house
I love you mommy
