[Verse 1]
Ah! Well it's the roughneck hooper, hang with Mr. Cooper
Get your pooper, scooper, trooper, cause I'm super-duper
Or should I say Superman?
Look at the clouds, open my shirt, Shaq-zam!
Like Cher I got the power, now I
Crush you like a flower cause I'm diesel like a I'm Hightower
[?] mic check, yo, I [?]
Don't forget to toc-tick in your cassette deck
Speakers blowin' (blowin')
Styles I keep showin' (showin'!)
[?]
Nah, might start snowin'
Tall, dark and handsome, and all that junk
I'm comin' with the monster dunk, get off me punk!

[Verse 2]
Ah-rum-pum-pum-pum, here I come, here I come, here I come
I forgot my verse! Uh, um… (kick it!)
Speakin' of kickin' mad styles, I got 'em by the carton
I was always known as Shaq Fu, ever since kindergarten
Cause I knick knack, paddy whack 'em, dig 'em, smack 'em
Shaq Attack 'em, soon my tune will be platinum (Ooh!)
So what you gonna do when that happen?
First you see me dunkin', now you see me rappin'
No monkeying' around, so don't give me no banana (Ana)
Suplex the mic like Tito Santana (Ana)
Bring it steadily, drop rhyme heavily
(whistling) That's my melody
So pass me the mic device, let me get nice
You can get the middle finger, Vanilla Ice
And when I see you, I'ma put in you check
Because I (I) am (am) a rough (what?) neck!

[Verse 3]
Wait a minute! Now it's time for me to get in it
I'm good to the left until I eats me spinach
I'm feeling strong-strong like King Kong-Kong
I smoke-smoke the mic-mic like Chee-Cheech and Chong-Chong
From Hong Kong, China, China to Japan
Ask Ed Lover, Dr. Dre, who's the man?
Peace to Snoop Dogg and his homie Dr. Dre
Bow wow wow, yippy yo, yippy yay
Cause brothers can't see me, they wanna be me
I'm comin' at ya, I'm comin' 3D
You don't know me, you don't know my style
'Bout to get goofy like Homer, pal
So when you see me, better give me respect
Cause I am a roughneck!
