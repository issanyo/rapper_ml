[Intro]
Come on (Come on! Come on!)

[Verse 1]
Leave me alone girl, I know you got some funk in the trunk
And you lookin' at a big old cluck, a mandingo
I'm bad at this, my status is
I rip down apparatuses
Won't you ask your mom and dad? Is this
The same juvenile delinquent?
I'm on a magazine cover frequent
I'm spittin' in a cup, drink it
Since you say you'd do anything for me
Me oh me , oh, my, my [?] amore
I see you like to wear my Shaq Attaq pumps
Sign this prenup , I'm not givin' you half like Donald Trump
'Cause your name ain't Havana
Popping no priest, now ask Madonna
Or do you really, really wanna?
We start somethin', somethin', somethin'
How can I ease the pain like Lisa something?
You wanna be with me, be where I've been
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin

[Hook]
(Shaquille, let me in, let me in)
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
(Shaquille, let me in, let me in)
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
(Shaquille, let me in, let me in)
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
(Shaquille, let me in, let me in)
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin

[Verse 2]
I'm just like info, you're never gonna get it
(That's the way love goes)
I'm not wit' it
Pass me by like Pharcyde
"Do you wanna ride with his hella fine, bonafide, qualified…"
You trick!
I'm shootin' in the [?]
Soundin' like Silk, talkin' 'bout
"Lemme, lemme lick you up and down
What do you say Shaq?"
Stop that, come back, rewind
Tryin' to get mine, I'm born to get mine
I'm like Morris Day, girl, I ain't got no time
So if you wanna sweat, and you wanna lick
Treat me like a [?]
'Cause I need a hooper check
You'd drink me like Pepsi? I doubt it
Have you seen my commercial? Don't even think about it
Your friend called me, you think I can't find ya…
Then I'll *69 ya
Then I call you back, "What the heck you doin'?
You ain't Alexis Carrington, I ain't J.R. Ewing"
I can show you my cabin and my log
You wanna come in? Nah, nah, chill with the dogs

[Hook]
(Shaquille, let me in, let me in)
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
(Shaquille, let me in, let me in)
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
(Shaquille, let me in, let me in)
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
(Shaquille, let me in, let me in)
Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin

[Verse 3]
Shaq be nimble, Shaq be quick
Some girls be playin' trick
Pullin' on me jersey like they play for New York Knicks
They tryin' to get paid, but I ain't one to get played
[?] so when you see me [?]
Gold diggers better forget it, I ain't wit' it
I'd rather eat it, spit it, then eat it again
Treat me like I wanna be treated
Or treat me like Michael Jackson, "Hee hee!"
And just beat it
I'm not dissin' all women, just some
The ones that act dumb-diddly-diddly-dumb-dumb
My name is Shaq and I'm done
Treat me like Kane, 'cause I ain't the one

[Outro: Unknown]
(Laughing) Hold up, man, hold up
Aye, look, you're not a gold digger?
This song is not pertaining to you
This is the Major League, and I'm chillin' with the Shaq
Peace, we outta here
