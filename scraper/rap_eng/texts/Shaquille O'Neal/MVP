(oohh heeyy ooohh girl you know ooh come on! come one!)

[Corey]
There is a funny feeling lately when you talk to me
I feel as if there's something your not telling me
I been hearing crazy roomers flying all around
What's the deal girl on the real girl
You don't wait for me at the bus stop no more
Don't even bring extra chips in lunch for your boy
With that stead should as I, I am failing with out you girl

[Chorus: Corey]
I just wanna know are we still down? don't want nobody else
I like having you around! baby can't you see? I need you on my team
Can't win with out my mvp. I just wanna know are we still down?
Don't want nobody else I like having you around! baby can't you see?
I need you on my team. can't win with out my mvp

[Corey]
I know I'm pretty young and I got alot to learn
But this situation really got me concerned
I saw a list with you name by someone else
Where was mine girl this the first time girl
Don't have to be this way watching you slip away
I never felt this way almost throw your picture away
I bet he can't make you laugh and smile like me
Cause we was down before we could read girl you know

[Chorus: Corey]
I just wanna know are we still down? don't want nobody else
I like having you around! baby can't you see? I need you on my team
Can't win with out my mvp. I just wanna know are we still down?
Don't want nobody else I like having you around!
Baby can't you see? I need you on my team
Can't win with out my mvp

[Shaquille O'Neal]
Yo yo you wanna ride with the king extreme
Shaq glim Shaq wrist just bling! ever since 15
Big things ever since I spit 16
So if you wanna holla come and see me
I need you to be the MVP or do you wanna stand and watch
And notice how each women just freeze when they see me
23's with the wood grin and a TV keep hits running veins on gp
I'm the one with the game on lock and them thangs on the drop
And it ain't gonna stop no I'm the same one
That you get the love and the nicknames from
Trust me I'm focused on the life girl
Who would of knew your left hand ring finger I mean I do it for you

[Chorus: Corey]
Girl I just wanna know are we still down? don't want nobody else
I like having you around! baby can't you see?
I need you on my team. can't win with out my mvp
I just wanna know are we still down? don't want nobody else
I like having you around! baby can't you see?
I need you on my team. can't win with out my mvp

I just wanna know are we still down? don't want nobody else
I like having you around! baby can't you see?
I need you on my team. can't win with out my mvp

And if your feeling me all my ladies scream if your feeling me
Home town let me scream if your feeling me
Westside let me scream if your feeling me
Eastside let me scream oooh girl

I just wanna know are we still down? don't want nobody else
I like having you around! baby can't you see?
I need you on my team. can't win with out my mvp
