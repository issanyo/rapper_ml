Thirteen never told Twenty-three "You're gonna be like this"
Like this
He lied to me, he lied to me. oh oooh
So if you look at history feeling like your generation's gonna rewrite this
Write this
Then ride with me. Ride with me, oh ooh
Then ride with me. Ride with me, oh ooh
Then ride with me. Ride with me, oh ooh
Then ride with me. Ride with me, oh ooh
Ride with me now, Ride with me now

When I was thirteen, I thought I'd be Twenty-three with a money tree
Michael Jordan stats whenever I'm recording raps
And now I'm in the mirror, nowhere near where I wanna be
They say be patient, yeah the Hare told the Tortoise that
Weekend with the team, throwed like the quarter back
Bucks have'em all on your sack like Warren Sapp
Them hoes get delivered to your door like you ordered that
Only 'bout a matter of time before you're bored with that
Dreads getting longer. Temper getting shorter
Burden of Success, and her legs on your shoulders
She sayin' be quick cause her friends coming over
So she pulled the thong over like a cop meeting quota
They say I'm getting vulgar, I just think I'm getting older
Or maybe its the slope that I'm slipping like a loafer
Try to crucify my T's, treat my I's like a polka
But the truth is still the truth whether you're faded or you're sober
Kelechi, Young Naija, Unamerican Idol
If you kill your old self, is that considered homicidal?
I'm ashamed, throwing shade, like "where the hell did your life go?"
Open condom wrapper next to an unopened bible
Would You from ten years ago be proud of You now?
Would he say he's seeing that potential outta you now?
Or would he lie to you now?
And say "You shoulda graduated, not to mention ain't no record labels signing you"
I think my best friends don't get me
They don't see it coming like a wet dream
Sometimes I think that God's tryna test me
But it's still STNDRD overall, that's the best team
Eggs in one basket, gets gritty, but it's gravy
In the scope of greatness, but the aftermath is shady
Ten years ago I thought that I would ball like I'm Baby
But now my pops being proud could make me bawl like a baby
It's crazy

Thirteen never told Twenty-three "You're gonna be like this"
Like this
He lied to me, he lied to me. oh oooh
So if you look at history feeling like your generation's gonna rewrite this
Write this
Then ride with me. Ride with me, oh ooh
Then ride with me. Ride with me, oh ooh
Then ride with me. Ride with me, oh ooh
Then ride with me. Ride with me, oh ooh
Ride with me now, Ride with me now

When I was thirteen, where did I see myself at twenty-three? Question is, I don't know. I was thirteen, 6'9", couldn't play, couldn't dunk. I could dominate the little kids but guys my age, I couldn't touch. So, in my case, I would go to the army base to play with the guys. They would never pick me and when I walked into the gym late I could see them whispering like: "Hey, don't pick him, he's terrible" and I was terrible, but I never gave up and I followed my dreams. What I wanted to be was professional NBA player, I wanted to be a rapper, and I wanted to be smart. And through using criticism and turning it into motivation, I accomplished all three. So the moral of the story is: Haters, they gon' hate but use that criticism and turn it into motivation
