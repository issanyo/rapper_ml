Al set it off!
Hey yo, Ill you set it off!
Hey yo, Shaq set it off!
Hey yo Al, you set it off!
Hey yo Shaq, you set it off!
Hey yo, Ill, you set it off!
Eh yo, Shaq set it off!
Al, set it off:

Well, it's the mister raspy that's beyond match
Come around my way A.K.A. Al Skratch
Hey yo, gimme mic check...
Nah hold up black, gimme that mic check
1-2 it's the Shaq
Hey yo, who!?
Shaquille! Ooh you know my style
I'm a' rhyme my way with big
Eh-ooh-la-isle?
Tall, schizophrenic- don't act dumb
Hey yo gimme mic check 1-2 I wanna get some
Big Ill, the bomb in the boondocks
Recorder
The thought'a, you flexin' in my section
Manslaughter
Pop in the tape, pump up the transistor
It's the - mister - raspy
A to the L
Finger to the trigger to the shell
As I open up the frequency
Come on and creep with me
I'll let you in on a secret, G
When I grab the microphone yo kid, I don't joke
Now cheer when I slam the jam
The Shh was dope

Mic check 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Mic check 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Mic check 1-2, 1-2, mic check
It's the Ill-Al Skratch-Shaq about to catch wreck

Shaq it! I could freak it Shaqapello
This big fellow
Is that you're girlfriend?
How you doin' hello
A-E-I-O-U, and sometimes Y
Call me Jimmy Snuka 'cause I'm super fly
Now who's the man? Me
No one's greater- Big Ill
What's up Shaq?
Take me out with the fader
Knock 'em up, knock 'em up
Here I come dummy
Not even big Shaq can take a rebound from me
I'm (?), my debt is (?) and paid in full
Comin' through like a writer or raging bull
Your jugular - protect your neck
Because I'm strangling
The gang, a man, I'll leave you hanging
From a tree dangling
One two here I go, the national
When I start the flow
I'm not the average Joe Shmoe
(?)Rhyme a' say rhyme a style(?)
I mock (?)
With the O-ee-o-ee-o-ee, o-ee-o-ee-ahhhhhh
Don't let me play you
Not on this debut
With the 7-foot S-H-A-Q

Mic check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Mic check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Mic check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
It's the Ill-Al Skratch-Shaq about to catch wreck

Hey yo I got a bling ding
Throw on the camouflage
'Cause I'm livin' too large
I'm livin' too large
Everybody know my face, now I'm down with Shaq
With the uptown connect that's right you got my back
Big Ill, I bounce like the ball in his hand
Now can I pass it back?
Yes you can, yes you can-can
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Rhymes I bust
Don't want to cuss
I'm in a rush
Plussss... I'm on a warpath
So get lost, break north
Step off with your (?) bags (?)
Mama said knock who out
How that sound?
Down with the brothers from Brooklyn uptown
Connect!
You better hit the deck
And protect you're neck
When I end the mic check, I catch rep

Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
It's the Ill-Al Skratch-Shaq about to catch wreck

Tell me: who got my back?
I got your back Shaq
I'm Big Ill, the mack
Creepin' through the hood with the nap sack
Pants sagging, hat cap to the rear
Slacker and so bobblin' 'cause I got the beer
You connect the funk known as mystique
Funk dunkah, clunkah-funkah
My technique is at the pinnacle
Fly high, big up in the sky
I, why ask why?
Pleasure principle
No rump to bump (???)
Times my art from Donald Trump
Inflate rhymes with my instra-pump
Tic-tac-toe I rip that flow
Like a real rap pro just to get that dough
Al-Skratch
Mac to my black groove
As I bust the jack move
My rap rules
I'm that smooth

Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Yo Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
It's the Ill-Al Skratch-Shaq about to get catch

Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
Yo Mic Check, 1-2, 1-2, mic check
