[Intro: Shaquille O'Neal]
Kanye, this Shaq, what's up, bro?
Happy birthday, sorry I couldn't be there
How old are you? It don't matter
You look good, baby, do what you do
You at the Staples Center, you lucky as they
You know what I was gon' do to you at the Staples Center
You remember

[Verse 1: Shaquille O'Neal]
Staples Center, that was me, 2001 to 2003
MVP, I did it by myself
Can't you tell by my accumulated wealth?
Kanye, me and you the same people
We underated, they treat us like we evil
It don't matter, happy birthday to you
Continue, cous', just do what you do
And I'm...

[Hook: Kanye West and Shaquille O'Neal]
And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs that'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan, happy birthday, Kanye
