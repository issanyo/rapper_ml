(Intro)
(Shaquille O' Neal)
This for all my brick city ballers
All the people from the slums and the villages
Slumvillage T.W.IsM. (Shaq)
Don't be mad at the play
Be mad at the game
I consider myself a major league player
The highest level of playerism
Check it (yeah) wha-wha-wha-wha
Slumvillage (city) T.W.IsM. (Bronx) wha-wha-wha-wha
Killer Cali wha-wha-wha-wha
Check it

(Shaquille O' Neal)
Yo my mind state all I want is platinum plates
Everything that my eyes see who can deny me
Make more in a day that's a lot of y'all touch
Y'all know the fake ballers' cause they always talk too much
Now, Question. How y'all gonna be hating on me?
Criticizing, debating on me
When I got you're baby mama waitin on me
While you down on one knee
I'm doin things that your rhymes can't see
The world is mine cause now I ain't easy to trust
Skills to much bet you get brushed and bust
Got thugs with ice mugs that handle heat for me
Legal teams that handle things for me like what
Mad at the players be mad at the game
(Like what baby)
Don't be mad cause they screaming my name
(Like what)
From North, South East to West
(Like what baby)
Don't get mad cause I'm the best at this
(Like what)

(Chorus)
(Hevin)
Get paid let's get this money-a
Like what major league playa (wha-wha-wha-wha)
Don't stop coast to coast (wha-wha-wha-wha)
Like what, what, what, what, what
Get paid let's get this money-a
Like what major league playa
Don't stop coast to coast
Like what, what, what, what, what

(Shaquille O' Neal)
I know a kid with four albums but don't get know respect
No matter what he do his life's always a test
He got stress on his chest and the world on his back
They say he's greedy he do too much he raps and acts
Then try to play ball and dominate the pros
I don't know why y'all mad he's just followin those
Who paved the way, cream and Dr. Jay
When they did a movie girl didn't have nothing to say
So can he play, can he claim the world is his?
Can he do the right thing instead and set example for kids?
Reach for the sky he's tryin to hold glitramatis
Handle your biz Shaq know what time it is like what
Be mad at the players be mad at the game
(Like what baby)
Don't be mad cause they screaming my name
(Like what)
From North, South East to West
(Like what baby)
Don't get mad cause I'm the best at this
(Like what)

(Chorus)
(Hevin)
Get paid let's get this money-a
Like what major league playa
Don't stop coast to coast
Like what, what, what, what, what
Get paid let's get this money-a
Like what major league playa
Don't stop coast to coast
Like what, what, what, what, what

(Shaquille O' Neal)
Before I burst let me let y'all know
You got a personal with Shaq better let it go
Don't y'all see it's not a game when you hittin dough
My man makes it kinda easy just to hit and go
Can't y'all see that I can't stand a lazy whirl?
The same way I can't stand a shady girl
Y'all didn't know JC is my baby girl
I gotta make it kinda sane in this crazy world
Talking trash'll get you smacked up crashed up
Get you with this Mic don't fall get your ..s up
Don't rub of the Shaq O' Neal
Incase you didn't know this ain't no novelty bro
This is album number four like what
Be mad at the players be mad at the game
(Like what baby)
Don't be mad cause they screaming my name
(Like what)
From North, South East to West
(Like what baby)
Don't get mad cause I'm the best at this
(Like what)
Be mad at the players be mad at the game
(Like what baby)
Don't be mad cause they screaming my name
(Like what)
From North, South East to West
(Like what baby)
Don't get mad cause I'm the best at this

(Chorus)
(Hevin)
Get paid let's get this money-a (don't be mad)
Like what major league playa (cause I'm the best at this wha-wha-wha-wha)
Don't stop coast to coast (I'm the best at this wha-wha-wha-wha)
Like what, what, what, what, what (I'm the best at this)

Like what, what, what, what, what (respect)
