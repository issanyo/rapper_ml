(Intro)
(Shaquille O' Neal)
Yo, yo (yo, yo)
We been kickin it now off and off along time (along time)
But I'm frustrated
I still don't know if you love me for me or the material things
Maybe it's time you start showing me (show me) you know
Gotta show me somethin uh-huh

(Chorus)
You've got to let me know just how far to let this go
Feel me (uh-huh, uh-huh) show me
You've got to take my hand show me that you understand
Feel me show-ooh me

(Shaquille O' Neal)
I took my time just to make sure my life was plush
Everything from scratch house built from the ground up
Around my family only loyal friends I trust
To love the right woman I found no need to rush
It's been years since we first met still we debate
I feel ya pain but good things come to those who wait
I'm insecure about a lot about the things I got
And if I share my spotlight you're not ready to plot
One of the main things I don't speed and take my time
But as I want to don't speed and make you mine
It's all about the future now don't wanna cease the past
Plus I know your first mistake might be your last
I know your wondering what's stopping us from getting close
If you look at it like me who benefits the most
It's not conceit it's a fact what I feel is true
Long as you keep it real with me I'll keep it real with you
Show me

(Chorus)
You've got to let me know just how far to let this go
Feel me (uh-huh, uh-huh) show me
You've got to take my hand show me that you understand
Feel me show-ooh me

(Shaquille O' Neal)
I want a woman I can love just to call my own
Pass the torture step down from the ballers' throne
Memories from my mother that we all condone
Doesn't matter if it's a mansion or the smallest home
That we live in the high priced cars ain't how you driven
I got to know what part of you don't mind giving
And strictly taking and when we made love you never fake it
Sometimes I think about all the stars who ain't make it
I know it's beautiful to have a few kids of life
And then I think back on what Robert did to Mike
In the beginning it was love every touch was soft
In the end the reign of bob style cut me off
I don't need to go to jail on the wife abuse Mr. Meaner
Or with a reputation like what Ike did to Tina
Plus it's I gotta stay Lord to love miss
Holly Berry and David how can that be justice

(Chorus)
You've got to let me know just how far to let this go
Feel me (uh-huh, uh-huh) show me
You've got to take my hand show me that you understand
Feel me show-ooh me

(Shaquille O' Neal)
So when I come through at night at time to keep you warm
I gotta let you know the deal and never lead you on
So work with me cause I've never been here before
And if I move to fast for your liking there's the door
Gotta do what's best for me what you want me to say?
Baby please don't leave you know I want you to stay
I hope that you already know that and even though
I'm in the NBA relationships are not a problem
See me big price pant-less TV chick schist can't trust
I glance up at this time to see the clock on two
I'm out the door but understand it's not a knock on you
So death do us deep like in the mob like when
I take your application are you right for the job
Until the take all the time I need for you to know me
Besides there is a few more things you need to show me

(Chorus)
You've got to let me know just how far to let this go
Feel me (uh-huh, uh-huh) show me
You've got to take my hand show me that you understand
Feel me show-ooh me (show me)
You've got to let me know just how far to let this go
Feel me (uh-huh, uh-huh) show me
You've got to take my hand show me that you understand
Feel me (help me) show-ooh me
You've got to let me know just how far to let this go
Feel me (uh-huh, uh-huh) show me
You've got to take my hand show me that you understand
Feel me
