[Intro]
You know, this just some real nigga shit
A real nigga story, you know what I'm saying?

[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

[Verse 1: Shaquille O'Neal]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
[?] for nobody else
You got that, dawg? They call me B.I.G
Yeah, from that square, killuminati
Big money, big cars, big balls, big house
On a big-big looks like a mall
Big boys buy big gifts for you chicks, that's how us ballers roll
I had to get up on this Future shit
I pull up in a whip, you be like: "that's future, shit"
Alrighty then, all I do is win
I'm like Mayweather, Rick Ross, Khaled 'em
No new friends, I could never ever-ever trust that
Before you extort I make a phone call get your [?]
(Blap-blap-blap!!) I pull out Soda Shaq
[?]
Got so much cash money, guess what?
You could call me Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
Copycat wannabes will never take my spot
Deliver like DiGiorno Pizza
Cause it's hot, hot, hot
Sometimes I question what you rappers spitting
You know in a post your ass is barbeque chicken
Don't need to go platinum, that's what you rappers do
I'll tweet this verse, that's 8 million views
Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul
Chicks see me they get wet, swimming pool
Call up Drake, let's play big bank take little bank
You ain't got enough, better get a loan from Mr. Bill Gates
And Donald Trump, and Carlos Slim
And call Obama, Oprah Winfrey then
I don't need no game, I just say my name
4 rings, 2020 hall of fame
Garage like Cee Lo, 4, 5 and sixes
Big black ass David Beckham
You see this verse, I kicked it

[Hook]
