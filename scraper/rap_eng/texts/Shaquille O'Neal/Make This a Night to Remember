Getting money droppin hits stoppin all y'all
Boy y'all tryin come let me warn y'all
Stall y'all I'ma make it if I'm hot or not
It is the money, ask yourself cause I got a lot
Not bein funny talkin sh.. but I pop a lot
And back it up and catch a breeze in the six-drop
And if it's sunny then I get deep in the kick drum
You think I'm wack baby girl come and get some
And see yourself when Shaq get these hits from
Same source that your man wouldn't bit from

Get ready tonight

Now I push the six with the bows in the back
Funny how the honeys come and pose when I'm at
In the Bronx and the shows where I'm at
You can ask the hoes in my flat
Shaq made a path I came through walkin
Now I'm pushin and got the whole cold stalkin
Feelin me knowin that I'm winning in the beginning
You thought it was a phase till I heard a brother read
Peter Gunz un fellow chapter uno bruise like Bruno
Slam like sumo who know money you know
I bring the funk like under arm and see me on
That's why they get me on delivery my ?denemerey?

(Shaquille O' Neal)
I'm a pro on the court on the microphone
Going platinum if I buy a million of my own
It gas there's recruits on same song
Why your man play off I'ma play on
Word is born pro Dawg is the Hit-man
Big dirt's hittin fools like quick sand
On a mission clear the path like Christian
Apply pressure to the...... Christian
Who the man Peter Gunz is you wit these
For all these undercover haters tryin to get these
Forget that cause baby mamma wanna hit these
And bring me drama while these cowards tryin to stick these
So nick these I'ma shine like the Sun do
As you know I'm made of steel so I'm gun-proof
There ain't a member of your crew I can't run through
Won't you page me later then I'll call you
Uh wanna play baby

(Chorus w/ variations)
