(Shaquille O'Neal)
Yo Kenny I want you to look in the phone book
Look up every model agency in the City of Los Angeles
And tell em about my new hundred-foot yacht that I just purchased
And tell em we about to do the ultimate pool party of the century
Hahaha, call em up, pool party, boogie all night
Hahaha, wha-wha-wha-wha

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Yo invite the whole city well mainly the rap fans
And don't forget to bring a six pack for the trashcan and
Fill up the pool with lots of water
Don't worry pops I got your daughter
I'll bring her home in one piece even though she came in a two piece
With those groupies it's a party you gotta move your body more often
Walk in soft lookin lost you'll gets tossed in
So leave home the jackets and Tim boots
Cause all I wanna see is sandals and swim suits
And get the lotion out cause the sun out
Cause now ya at the party where the grub don't run out
No fights between blacks or whites
The vibe is tight big Shaq is on the Mic
So raise up the roof with both your hands wha-wha
And boogie to my pool jam

(Chorus)
(Hevin)
Bouncin hot let's get wet welcome to the pool jam
Bouncin hot keep it tight welcome to the pool jam
Bouncin hot let's get wet welcome to the pool jam
Bounce right you know you want to party with me

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Yo the neighbors is tweakin cause there ain't no way to steeking
But I ain't listenin it's the weekend so let the bass rock
There's no place to park on the block gotta walk use the side gate it's unlocked
All the honeys lookin fine slumville started up the Soul train line
Lookin at the Lexus it's about that time to call my baby girl
Got to protect what's mine the ladies are squallin by the fox
My player never chops take off your shoes and socks
Your bottoms and your tops you don't need it
The pool's heated you wanna be conceited - beat it!
I'll be in the Jacuzzi gettin treated like a King
Throw my grub down gettin rubbed down
There's no time for attitude my days shatter proof
Just push up your hands at the pool jam boogie with me

(Chorus)
(Hevin)
Bouncin hot let's get wet welcome to the pool jam
Bouncin hot keep it tight welcome to the pool jam
Bouncin hot let's get wet welcome to the pool jam
Bounce right you know you want to party with me

(Hevin)
Our pool jams our (my girl) always the best in town
Our pool jams our always the best in town

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Takin mad noise while my boys mingle
The weathers hot like the big Shaq single
Don't know how my thing go I rush em like
I'll take 4 of ya baby even warrior
Started up on ya girl like Victoria
But it's not a secret baby on the dance floor
Show me how you freak it
Slumville's mixin breaks and Tom's on the grill with the fish and steaks
And fixin plates the ladies too fly to swim
And Kenny's on the air with the poolside basketball rim
While dirt belly flapper swam guy
Buckie is in the crib on the NBA Live
You can't crack the vibe you about to boogie all night
The vibe is tight and big Shaq is on the Mic
So raise up the roof with both your hands wha-wha-wha-wha
Welcome to my pool jam

(Chorus)
(Hevin)
Bouncin hot let's get wet welcome to the pool jam
Bouncin hot keep it tight welcome to the pool jam
Bouncin hot let's get wet welcome to the pool jam
Bounce right you know you want to party with me
Bouncin hot let's get wet welcome to the pool jam
Bouncin hot keep it tight welcome to the pool jam
Bouncin hot let's get wet welcome to the pool jam
Bounce right you know you want to party with me
