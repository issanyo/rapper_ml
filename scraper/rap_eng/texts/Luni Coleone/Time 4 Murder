Uh (Uh)
What What What What....Uh
It's Luni Coleone [Repeat]

I let him know nigga
I break him off from the yay
It's Luni Coleone
I ain't out for the play
Time waits for no man and I preach that shit
Hear the poppin off at mouth
I'mma bust that lip
Mista hit him quick
Mista hit him quicker
On the down
Hop in like a gang or group house
Bout to scratch ho
Fuck a nigga
And that's my motto
On the rizzeal
If niggas try to flex I eat 'em up like oatmeal
And fuck a front row
In the streets that's a no-no
But if she got ass
I'mma take her like some no-dos
I use to bring beans now it's me on the table
Lookie here Mama now I got my own label
I'm 22 years old with a beer belly
Eyes fucked in the club by gone off the smelly
Been there but done did that niggas
Down with the dirt
Pull it out
Then shoot that nigga
Where it hurts

[Chorus:]
They says time waits for no man
So I got time to wait on no man
I'm dumpin with the gat in my hand
Track nasty on my nuts see the paper ???
I let him know it's Coleone on the fuckin gate
Creep on the patna let him have it with the .38
I tell u one more gen
Time waits for no man
So when I'm commin I'm dumpin
Bust him with the gat in my hand

I hit the gas like a motherfucking 3-way ???
Leanin bodies in the trunk
Straight cold ass fuck
I'm the nigga with the quickest trigger
Down to pull it
Dump a whole click if a nigga on some bullshit
It's West Coast
Straight entrepreneur
Lead a bitch to the bank like a fish lure
And if a motherfucker dump
I'mma bust him with a sawed-off
Hop on him like a rabbit
Dag-nabbit
I've been pissed off
Niggas got me fucked up
Like I'm soft
But I'm hockin up
Then that's when yo Grandpa call
Ain't no greater G than me
Fuck what you reppin
Niggas get caught without their motherfucking weapon
Disrespecting ass holes wanna be hard
But Oh No!
If he holler let him go
Fuck that
Fuck the ho
Chitty Chitty I bang blue
Punk nigga I thought you knew
Time waits for no man
So I'm commin at you like a fool

[Chorus]
I wish a nigga would run up
I'm quick to let him have it
On a lead pistola
In your ass young faggot
Used to have love
But now I'm out to kill people
Cross game
You'll be in more shit than a dung beetle
This California lifestyle livin (Is no joker)
I work rap and sell bomb yay (To all smokers)
Hell yeah I'm proud of the life I lead
Drink 40's till I throw up
And choke off weed
Ain't no nigga alive can put fear in this G
I'm a psycho
Like ??? boy put that on me
It's my time to shine
So I'm going for mine
Fuck me and my bitch
Boy this me and my .9
Out to rule the world nigga
So...uh...what you gone do?
It's my style bitch
And I'll change it if I want to
Whatever wrap it on up like a doggy bag
Time waits for not a thang
Put yo G's on that

[Chorus]
Uh Uh Uh Uh...nigga
What What What What
Uh It's Luni Coleone

Uh Uh
What What What What
Motherfuckers

Yall can't fuck wit it
