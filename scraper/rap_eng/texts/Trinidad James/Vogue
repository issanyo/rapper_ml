[Verse 1] (Trinidad James)

Amsterdam, jungle vibe
London England, jungle vibe
Hit the states and we jungle vibe
Pretty girl, pretty girl, broke up wine

Flexin' the Bape
(Skrrt!) in the rave
Why you all in my face? (My face)
You don't know my name (Names)

Drop down
The whole place shutdown (Hey!)
Drop down
So much love now (Hey!)

Attitude on what now? (What now?)
Keen for you to walk now (Walk now)
You know we don't play that (Nah)
Full Crate, where that bass at?

[Hook]

Vogue, like magazine
Back up with the bullshit     x3
Knock it with the bullshit

Vogue, like magazine
(Hey, hey, hey!)

[Chorus] Trinidad James & (Bryn Christopher)

Vogue
Like magazine
Vogue

(Vogue like a magazine)

[Verse 2]

(Woo!) Hallelujah
(Woo!) How you doin'?
My ex so gone I called the Holy Ghost
I'm talking so far gone I'm living comfortable

Stop, photoshoot
Pose, photoshoot
I don't stress no more baby over you
I can't answer your call I'm not available (Bye!)

Vogue, like magazine
Back up with the bullshit
Knock it with the bullshit

What that mean? It mean any means necessary
R.I.P. to my enemies and adversaries
Livin' life, livin' my dreams
Amsterdam this week, next week Tel Aviv
Tell your friend, tell your friend baby let's leave
Clear your mind baby girl, just breathe

[Hook]
[Chorus]

(You ready?) x4
