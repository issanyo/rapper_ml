[Intro: Chopped n' Screwed]
Say i don't dance x7

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Say i don't dance, this all I do
I don't dance, this all I do
I don't dance, this all I do
I don't dance this all I do, this all I do x9

[Verse 1]
Box Chevy bitches, and some Magnims
Countin show money like trap money, that's why I'm ashy
Take you back to high school before I started trappin
[?] with the creases, Polo on my khakis
I got hoes in Riverdam, I got hoes in [?]
I got hoes in Texas nigga, I got hoes in Vegas
I don't give a fuck, if these niggas like me
That's how my momma made me, punch a nigga call me [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you bout these niggas mane (What's that?)
Put you on game
If he say that he the realest, then he probably fibbin mane
Let me tell you bout these bitches mane (What's up?)
They all the same
You can walk round with that cape
But ain't no saving Lois Lane
Look, she play all them games ain't got no rings
She Patrick Ewing
If you ain't gettin money, nigga what the hell you doing? (He broke)
All them sob stories, boy I tried to sympathize
But I only see ya bitch inside ya mothafuckin eyes
This that Southside shit
All my cousins locked up
I don't even know them niggas
I don't even give a fuck
This that Forte fuckin Bowie give a damn if you don't like me
They gonna have to lock a nigga up and put me up in Rice St
Fuck em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
First off, you are not a boss
You don't take from the top when it's cake on the block
Put your face on the cock
You date her relax, she just take what you got
How you play 'em, you might as well be raping the twat
Put our West no, take that wack off cause you fucked up
First and last nigga with these niggas
Damn they 1-0-1
All I'm with is 101
Penis got her hood like bae
Lightskinned [?] shaded at the mouth
This mothafucka look like Drake
Nah nigga on shade
[?]
Illest davidians in my domain
Upper class bitches that sniff cocaine
My jewels without flaw
My bitch without flaw
My niggas without flaw
I'm on, ain't off
And if can't fight all of ya, I'm calling on the crew
And nigga I don't dance
Hand-to-hand is all I do bitch
