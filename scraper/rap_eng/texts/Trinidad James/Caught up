[Hook: Trinidad James]
Caught up
These niggas too caught up
Caught up
These niggas too caught up
Caught up
In my shit

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
I live my life by 3 things
I live my life by 3 Ps
Pleasure Pussy and Peace
That's just a part of me
I am the shit oh pardon me
You being fly as me I don't see how
When I'm dressing the clouds
Kicks game as old as a [?]
My bitch is Jupiter-bound
Bring your bitch over were taking her down
Try with my niggas we taking you out
My niggas hustle to get to the pounds
Finished stocking and shipping em out
Bunch of trap niggas holding it down (x2)
Jealous niggas, they can't hold me down (x2)

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Caught up
These niggas too caught up
Caught up
These niggas too caught up
Caught up
In my shit

[Verse 2: 31 Gramms]
I step out the whip
Looking just like a brick
Do he rap or he trap he probably do both looks at his wrists
Look at his bitch, she badder then metro
You can't tell he no she don't do no rejection
Booty sit up I don't deal with ejection
Niggas [?] I can't deal with connection
You need more reconnecting
But get the fuck on with that flexing
You say you heard it from so and so and so and so ain't get your message
Why the fuck did you come in my blessing
Need to go get you some money
Go fuck with folks and go find she cause to us you look like a dummy

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Caught up
These niggas too caught up
Caught up
These niggas too caught up
Caught up
In my shit
