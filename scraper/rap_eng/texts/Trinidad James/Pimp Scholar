I was an MJQ in my all black suit
Nigga, everything gold, even my motherfucking tooth
My Yeezy's was the twos
Man, I gave these niggas hell
And I gave this hoes a blues
Now niggas run and tell, and buy these bitches shoes
Man, the A' done change, and it’s all thanks to you

She ain’t met pimping till pimping came and got her
If you never met a pimp, then bitch, I’m a scholar
She ain’t met pimping till pimping came and got her
If you never met a pimp, then bitch, I’m a scholar
She ain’t met pimping till pimping came and got her
If you never met a pimp, then bitch, I’m a scholar

[Corey Davis]
She ain’t know what’s pimping or what isn’t, what’s the difference?
As long as he’s consistent, she was with it, but forget it
He was busy fishing for them bitches, trying to get their digits
She was on a mission in the kitchen, prepping for a picnic
Now she feeling ignorant ‘cause he never visit where she living
And they used to kick it every day, feeling fade away
So she pray to the sky that she’ll meet the type of guy
To wife her up, ‘cause those lonely nights wasn’t right for her
So I stepped into her life and that night she fell in love
Yeah my crew, stay fresh as fuck, ain’t nothing quite as nice as us
Listen, I'm conditioned, got a PHD in pimping
I will take ya'll niggas bitches, that’s just a premonition

[A.ware]
Road scholar, ho holla at thenew mack of the millennium
I could look deep into your eyes and I could see many men
None of them niggas could hold a candle against the fire that I lit into her hind sight
Travel the world like three blind mice
Or siamese twins in search of that new found light, get it?
Plus there ain’t nobody A.ware sound like
Plus I’m the only nigga in this rap shit you got a crown, Christ
So if you see her in your town twice
Don't ask no questions, pay that money, nigga, yousa trick and I’m Ike
Yeah, that’s Turner, pass a burner on my personal
Just to let you niggas know I ain’t fugazy jerking you
