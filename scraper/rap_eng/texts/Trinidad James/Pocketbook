[Verse 1]
My Name will leave you stained
And you won't complain
You won't be the same
That's one Bad Ass Dame
I never wait in line, that's a waste of time
When I like, it's mine. I turn up to unwind
I see you looking, you want my pudding
But don't you try touching or else you WILL GET SEEN!
My bag got some heat, go head ask about me!!!
Just cause I look sweet, don't mean a GOT DAMN THING

Hook: (x4)
Grab it, click it, cock it!
Grab it, click it, cock it!
Grab it, click it, cock it
I keep that thing up in my PocketBOOK

[Verse 2]
I don't normally sip on Hennessy
But I swear that dark brought out the light in me!!
I feel like Shining. I'm not high Im gliding
My vibe got you flying. This tune got you sliding
I do what I want, Then I want some more
And bet I'll get it all, It's just a phone call
You need to get like me and not care bout a thing
If someone run they mouth, don't be acknowledging

Hook: (x4)

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
It was all good, till she showed up
With click-clack in that handbag
I said excuse me I don't mean to brag
But this girl here, she keep the strap
So it Gucci bag, four, five
Fendi bag? Nigga baby nine!
Extra bullets, no make-up
That's real nigga, no Maybelline
Don't make the mistake of
Thinking that you're fly! No mame!
Cause with that bag open
Bullets might just fly!
Your ho want to box, no! But my girl do know boxing
Your ho might get shot, thinking my girl ain't bout it
Your ho brought her friends, my girl brought her strap
Them hoes they changed their mind
When that strap came off her lap, bitch!
Grabbed it, clicked it, cocked it, cause
Losing, ain't no option!
Keep yo pretty ass in that mirror
Cause this action, bitch ain't bout it
You can't say a nigga ain't warned you
You can't say I ain't save your life
My home girl Stori, bitch, be bout that life, yeah!

[Verse 4]
Always keep a full clip
Well equipped Grab then click
U've just been picked By that bitch -u legit (now)
Bitches on ur dick now - Sick how
Things'll turn around like quick - wow
Buy the cow, the milk is worth the fee
Kosher/Halal - No taste for free
Everybody wanna piece - commodity
My stock wouldn't drop in this economy
My policy is ferocity
So I modestly give no apologies!!
