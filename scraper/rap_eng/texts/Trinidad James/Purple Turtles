[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel on this ride home?
On this ride home (on this ride home)

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
I'm too high to ride home alone my mind's gone
Feeling demons throwing shade at me
Tweaking thinking that my lights on
Tryna see my future with the brights on
Take a sip and keep the vibe going
Take a hit and get in my zone
Press a button make the seats warm
Too warm, thinking of too much
Things I can't change, who and not to trust
I'm thinking of too much
Family and fame the lesson of 2 loves
I'm good at doing me
I ain't good at doing us
I'm good at causing pain
I ain't good at doing love

[Chorus]
How does it feel?
How does it feel on this ride home?
On this ride home

How does it feel?
How does it feel on this ride home?
On this ride home

[Verse 2: 31gramms]
Feel like a nigga been through it
Been fighting all my life, back down I ain't never gonna do it
Pull a gun on me and don't use it, I'ma blues ya
Probably put you on the 11 o' clock news-a
Then get right back to the usual
Sellin' ice cream, shit jumpin' like Bruster's
Old one
Bitch I really came from the trench
On the block with the rock going hard in the paint
Took a charge I was still in the game
First 5 30 pounds and I took it like a man
Uh, you ain't did this shit
Pussy ass nigga I done lived this shit
Back in 2012 I was facing 10 years
Beat that bounced back and I'm still gettin' lit
Uh, you niggas still ain't shit
Still ain't gettin' no kind of money
Out here lookin' bad, fuck kinda bummy
But you still wanna beef and I find it funny
Fuck that put a deuce on the rocks
Count it up and put it back in the box
Bust a bag right off the scale
Wanna be a trapper ask me how does it feel

How does it feel?
How does it feel on this ride home?
On this ride home

How does it feel?
How does it feel on this ride home?
On this ride home
