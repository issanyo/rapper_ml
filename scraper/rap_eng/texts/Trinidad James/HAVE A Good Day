[Intro]
Ay man check this shit out man, I hope very real nigga listening, I hope very fuck nigga listening, I hope very young nigga listening
Hope every street nigga listening, hope very main bitch listening, I hope every side bitch listening

[Hook] x2
I say no bitch, I'm not ratchet
I'm a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I say no nigga, I'm no role model
I'm a real nigga, I'm a real nigga

[Verse 1]
I say young nigga run these streets, make street niggas run in their house
Nigga tryna tell me I'm lyin', nigga tryna' tell me I'm lyin'
My young nigga out here 16, he put yo ass for a smile
Rob yo ass for shine, juug went through your watch
Thats what we call birthtown, nigga better tuck yo chain
Nigga better hide your wallet, young nigga gives no fucks
Young nigga got no consience, all they see is a rolex E
All they know is they watches, just sit with [?] and Lil B
Nigga I started from the bottom, now a real nigga got got options
Got bitches like bufee, when its lunch time niggas ain't popping

Now I'm that young nigga popping
Tags, mops
And all these young niggas mops

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I say all my niggas got prize, ain't no I ain't talking bout riches

Most shining nigga jewelry fake, my babies should think the same thing

Popped your bitch and she leaking, you still popping molly you tripping
