[Verse 1: Trinidadians Neval]
I want them souls to burn
I want a heart to shine
Cause love is just not enough this time
Make me feel alive right now
Make me feel so right, right now
Step to the beast, eyes you'll need
You'll never take my joy from me

[Hook]
Never take my joy no
Never take my joy
Never take my joy no
Never take my joy

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Broken hearts, broken hearts
Is all I see, I can't fix em all
But Its worth the start, worth the start
Tryna keep my life on track
Life on track, life on track
Gettin' back just to fall right back
Am I hangin' up? or never coming back
I shouldn't feel this way but I feel a crash

[Bridge: Trinidad James and Trinidadians Neval]
Life is so tragic,I can't imagine
To let you go (let you go)
To let you go (let you go)
Life is so tragic, I can't imagine
To free my soul, to free my soul

[Hook]
Never take my joy no
Never take my joy
Never take my joy no
Never take my joy

[Outro: Denice Millien and Trinidadians Neval]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
