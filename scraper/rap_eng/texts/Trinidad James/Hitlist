I know you’ve been talking shit but I don’t mind
And I know you’ve got them bitches on the side
I don’t fuck around
Pull the trigger down
Cause I ain’t one of those bitches
So I’ll scratch you off my Hitlist

You think that your better than me
That ain’t right
Catch a bullet by me (boom) anytime
Don’t, like, always tryin guess whatcha thinkin
Don’t, like, if you say it better mean it
Imma make you mad at yourself
You gunna feel it just how I felt
Cause it never seemed right till I left
I finally gotchu out of my head, my head

(Chorus)
I know you’ve been talking shit but I don’t mind
And I know you’ve got them bitches on the side
I don’t fuck around
Pull the trigger down
Cause I ain’t one of those bitches
So I’ll scratch you off my Hitlist

(Trinidad James)
I know that I made your life complete (woah)
I know that I made your life crazy (hey)
Told ya upfront about my lifestyle
Multi pussy lifestyle
Whiskey make a nigga act wild
Why is you trippin my bitches
Every girl I fuck you fuck with me
What is the difference
Them is our bitches
I don’t really care about your Hitlist
I’m the only one of your shitlist
I know I still do it the best
I’m the one that bullet can’t catch
And I know why your mad at yourself
Shit don’t feel the same with no one else

(Chorus) X2
I know you’ve been talking shit but I don’t mind
And I know you’ve got them bitches on the side. I don’t fuck around
Pull the trigger down
Cause I ain’t one of those bitches
So I’ll scratch you off my Hitlist
