[Intro : Trinidad James]
What you thought, we were gon' turn out
From the mothefuckin' Southside ?

[Intro/Bridge : Trinidad James]
You from the East side, then throw it up
You from the East side, then throw it up
You from the West side, then throw it up
You from the West side, then throw it up
This is south side and we showin' up
This is south side and we showin' up

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Ratchet bitches, we love 'em
Classy bitches, we fuck 'em
Southside nigga, 'til the death of me
Fuck nigga, it's nothin'

[Verse 1 : Forte Bowie]
I'm from the Southside of the city
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me
We keep it 100, y'all niggas do 50
These bitches ain't nothin'
All these hoes is tricky
I'm saving all my love
That's rest in peace to Ms. Whitney
I said what the fuck is your problem, nigga?
Flexin' up like you mobbin', nigga
Boss up with your bitch ass
My team put you on silent, nigga
What it does, I'm in this bitch
I'm on the juice and my bitch too thick
Them thirsty hoes don't get no dick
Them thirsty hoes don't get no dick
I get it how I live it cause I spit it like a G
I get ig'nant when I'm in it, cause we winning, can't you see ?
Nigga I walk it like I wanna walk it
Talk it like a bitch
Niggas be smilin' up in my face
But they be steady talkin' shit
Pussy nigga what's up ?! What's up ?!
Ya ain't nothin' but a busta ! Busta !
Southside nigga do Southside shit
Y'all niggas done fucked up ! Fucked up !
Tell a pussy nigga what's up ?! What's up ?!
Ya ain't nothin' but a busta ! Busta !
Southside nigga do Southside shit
Y'all niggas done fucked up ! Fucked up !
Givin' it to 'em like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Trinidad James]
I’m from 417, Valley hill
We got Phillips 66, fuck a Texaco (yes sir!)
Y'all niggas rookie, I’m professional (bitch!)
Bringing swag back for these niggas (yes sir!)
Don’t believe? Check my instagram
Check the comments, your girl in ‘em (jealous)
Got emoji faces with the hearts in 'em (freak!)
Can’t trust these women, put yo heart in 'em (true!)
This my year -- I’m going hard, nigga
Call me the truth ? That's a understatement
I prefer to call the butt naked (no socks)
I like my bitches butt naked (no drawls)
Got weed and molly and swag for sale
Fuck nigga, I’m not playin'
Miss lady, I’m just sayin'
What the pussy going for? Cause I don’t mind paying
Southside nigga now I play it; I ain’t bourgie, ho
Catch me at AMC 24, my slim ho
Me and her in them Concords
Gives these hoes a heart attack
When a Southside nigga in a bucket hat
With them diamond slacks (them diamond slacks)
My belt be A-S (Jame$), my outfit be Offset (Jame$!)
And kicks calls for a double take cause these joints ain't out yet (GOLDGANG!!)
I couldn’t wait, I had to do it
She telling me she had to do me
Passed on the pussy, got mad and let my nigga Forte do her
