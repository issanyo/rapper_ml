[Verse 1]
They think we're fools sitting on the corner
Older you get, the more like your father
The more I drink, the more like my brother
Seem to have picked up on a callous trait
Hate people who think their life is a drama
Making in-jokes about Americana
Amusing myself is worth it for the karma
Obama sounds like Osama to me
Well, my bedroom's watched by an intifada
Kids with bricks or strips in Gaza
Point at me in my pyjamas
Laugh and scream, "Get out of bed!"
I say "I am, I got plans, I'm meeting up with Martha"
I'm a shoulder, she's Robert Palmer
Acts like a twat but she's a top banana
Might as well admit she's addicted to love

[Chorus]
Caught in a spider's web, it's not the first time playing dead
I see I saw lovers undercover, no one found out until we left
Caught in a spider's web, it's not the first time playing dead
They know something, oh well, we're running
I know they'll catch up in the end

[Verse 2]
You walked in last with a dirty Barbour
Found me at the bar in fits of laughter
Said you've been seen out digging the past with Arthur
You'd rather just walk in the rain
At a party with Ash as they smash a pi√±ata
Can I leave some stuff here for you to look after?
I'll be back around probably in the mid-summer
New York, New York, man I love the city!

[Chorus]
Caught in a spider's web, it's not the first time playing dead
I see I saw lovers undercover, no one found out until we left
Caught in a spider's web, it's not the first time playing dead
They know something, oh well, we're running
I know they'll catch up in the end

[Bridge]
In the hustle and the bustle, I feel I'm in trouble
And I trip and then I stumble, I feel myself fall
In the hustle and the bustle it's too rough
I tumble in the gravel and the rubble, can you hear me call?
In the hustle and the bustle, I feel I'm in trouble
And I trip and then I stumble, I feel myself fall
In the hustle and the bustle it's too rough
I tumble in the gravel and the rubble, can you hear me call?

[Verse 3]
With a wheezing chest and a leaking ceiling
Baby next door screaming all evening
The beatings we got and the ones we're seeking
We're stubborn as fuck and I'm proud to say
That me and Ben Skeleton mixed our own medicine
Never let a critic affect our direction
Barricade doors with our pale complexion
Program a beat bones I'll just keep telling them
How selling them a brand is a band complication
A man in a room with a survey for the station
Trying to get it on air, no care for creation
I guess it's all part of indoctrination

[Bridge]
In the hustle and the bustle, I feel I'm in trouble
And I trip and then I stumble, I feel myself fall
In the hustle and the bustle it's too rough
I tumble in the gravel and the rubble, can you hear me call?
In the hustle and the bustle, I feel I'm in trouble
And I trip and then I stumble, I feel myself fall
In the hustle and the bustle it's too rough
I tumble in the gravel and the rubble, can you hear me call?

[Chorus]
Caught in a spider's web, it's not the first time playing dead
I see I saw lovers undercover, no one found out until we left
Caught in a spider's web, it's not the first time playing dead
They know something, oh well, we're running
I know they'll catch up in the end

[Bridge]
In the hustle and the bustle, I feel I'm in trouble
And I trip and then I stumble, I feel myself fall
In the hustle and the bustle it's too rough
I tumble in the gravel and the rubble, can you hear me call?
In the hustle and the bustle, I feel I'm in trouble
And I trip and then I stumble, I feel myself fall
In the hustle and the bustle it's too rough
I tumble in the gravel and the rubble, can you hear me call?
In the hustle and the bustle, I feel I'm in trouble
And I trip and then I stumble, I feel myself fall
In the hustle and the bustle it's too rough
I tumble in the gravel and the rubble, can you hear me call?
In the hustle and the bustle, I feel I'm in trouble
And I trip and then I stumble, I feel myself fall
In the hustle and the bustle it's too rough
I tumble in the gravel and the rubble, can you hear me call?
