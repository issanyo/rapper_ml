[Intro: Trinidad Jame$]
Life, rap, its a game, just, its  a game, reality, its not a game

[Hook: Trinidad Jame$]
Life ain't shit Like the rap game
I say life ain't shit like the rap game
Life ain't shit like the rap game
I say life ain't shit like the rap game
Life ain't shit like the rap game
So my nigga, why you rapping?
Life ain't shit like the rap game
So my nigga, why you rapping?

[Verse 1: Trinidad Jame$]
I say my nigga, why you rapping?
Is you tryna' make a change or you just want a chain?
I'm just askin'
I wish the bombings in Boston, never happened
Some times I wish, I never started rapping
It changed how my friends, started acting
And I ain't never changed, since I started rapping
The crazy shit is, since I started rapping
Is that the same niggas hating, is the same niggas clapping
And the same niggas hating, is the same niggas rapping
And I pray for a change, but I never see the action
Maybe if I pray for a chain, the shit'll quicker happen
Or maybe I just pray for a Range, so I can crash it
I just wanna burn into flames, and live through the ashes
Uh? I just wanna burn into flames, and live through the ashes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trinidad Jame$]
Niggas trying real hard, but them niggas ain't real
And when a nigga be real, them niggas ain't here
I gotta talk about a whip, 26's on the chevy
I gotta talk about a bitch, now you niggas wanna listen?
Y'all niggas chasing hits, my niggas chasing visions
My niggas chasing liqour, y'all niggas chasing bitches
And if yo life out the frame, nigga change the picture
And while you niggas wait, I let my nigga say

[Hook]

[Interlude]
*phone rings*
31:'' Wassup bruh?''
Trinidad: ''Bruh I'm calling you right back bruh I'm going to give you a verse real quick.''
31:''All good.''

[Verse 3: 31]
Life ain't shit like the rap game
And you ain't spendin' 'bout your life while you rap man
I graduated out the trap man
You a grandaddy [?]
You just wanna get a name, maybe make a little change
Tryna get my niggas out the chain game
Telling me to put him on 'cus he heard me on the song
Now I know all along that yo motherfucking

[Hook]
