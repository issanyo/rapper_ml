My trunk pussy pop (pop)
Them hoes down to bop (bop)
My trunk pussy pop (pop)
Them hoes down to bop (bop)
My trunk pussy pop (pop)
Them hoes down to bop (bop)
My blades swing and chop (chop)
Them subwoofers knock (knock)
Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho
Show yo' grill ho

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Yeah dat me, yeah dat right
So throwed off the drank that I'm outta sight
Pushin' buttons caddy corner crushin'
Cluckin', bussas they claim they wanna fuck tonight
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Dark skinned nigga with a playa voice
Have y'all thinkin' I'm Barry White
Pop up twice I ain't trippin' on nothin'
Tires on rotation and the bass still buzzin'
Old school whip with the A/C cuttin'
Calibrate the navigation, bitch don't touch it
Hit the flo', you bet I get the flo'
I got bands to spend, you got twat to show
You can bop for gold, but I'm grain grippin'
Trunk shakin' like a stripper pole came with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
My car candy painted, my house sit on a hill
I never was a square, I always worked the wheel
Always had them boppers, ridin' on some choppas
Parking lot warfare, my trunk go blocka blocka
They way I beat the bass, wassup? might catch a case
Broke another bank and put it in they face
Ever since I rolled up with the doors on Transforma'
Four done poured up, niggas had to hate
Wheels on chrome, I had to slow my four's up
Cuz them potholes deep and I can't let them scrape
I let my tape knock, 'til my tape pop
Tell them motherfuckers that I got that bass

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
I said of course I'mma show my grill, and show my ass
I came on this earth in 87, pussy nigga check my past
Been a real nigga ever since, ride around the A with my nigga named Tay
Beatin' down them fuckin' blocks, from Conley Road to Moreland A
Nigga don't talk you ain't bout dat life
Drop top Chevy with the Bow Tie pipes
Let that Chevy breathe on em
When you pull up to that light
Hit the gas and watch that Chevy pop an ollie
Half these young niggas on rims
But my Chevy sit on rallys

[Hook]
