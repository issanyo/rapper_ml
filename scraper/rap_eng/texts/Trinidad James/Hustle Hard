[Intro]
I said you know it's going down, Dirtyphonics in this bitch (A town)
TJ, UZ, UZ, UZ, UZ

[Verse 1]
When I was young, I ain't had much of shit
Fifteen I had a job and fifteen, I had to quit
Turned around the next year, was serving niggas knicks
I done sold everything, nigga, I can make a list
Y'all niggas ain't hustling
And y'all niggas ain't grinding
I done seen it all, trust me
Only take a lil timing

[Pre-Hook]
If you know that you a hustler, put your fucking hands up
If you know that you a hustler, put your fucking hands up
If you know that you a hustler, put your fucking hands up

[Hook]
You gotta hustle till you die (hustle hard)
You gotta hustle till you die (hustle hard)
You gotta hustle till you die (hustle hard)
You gotta hustle till you die (motherfucking hustle)

[Break]
Can't stop hustling, no sir
Can't stop grinding, no sir
Can't stop hustling, no sir
Can't stop grinding
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle

[Verse 2]
I could never stop hustling, nigga, it's in my blood
I could never stop grinding, man, I'm from the hood
And I can't do broke, it don't look good
And you don't get your money up, it gets [?]
I gotta stay fresh, I gotta feed my family
Cause if I can't do that then what I'm living for?
I don't wanna pull that uzi out and hurt a nigga
Dirty with the thought man, you don't wan' get robbed nigga
