We have to let em know, we have to let em know
We have to let em know, we have to let em know
(I have to let em know, you have to let em know)
You have to let em know, we have to let em know
We ain’t letting go, you ain’t letting go
We ain’t letting go, you ain’t letting go
We ain’t letting go, you ain’t letting go
We ain’t letting go, you ain’t letting go

[Verse 1]
Somebody spark a spliff
Somebody roll the funk
We need a case a Stag, a couple Carib
Pour the liquor out
Pour the liquor out, for the real niggas dead
A lot of real niggas gone, we can’t forget
We have did so many wrong
That we can’t forget
So we keep on bumping
And refuse to quit
The baddest man to the baddest bitch
All gone feel this shit
East Trinidad, the west Trinidad
The north south in this bitch
Don’t tell me bout the government
Tell me bout the youth
Don’t tell me bout the politics
We need to save the youth
Cause when the future come, I ain’t living for no regret
And when the future come we’ll be the ones
Listening to the kids
Said focus young man
Focus on your life
Too many kids having kids these days
I can’t believe this shit
You a grandma, grandpa
At the age of 36
It’s a new theory now, hey
This real nigga shit
