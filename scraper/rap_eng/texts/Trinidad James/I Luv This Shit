[Verse 1: August Alsina]
It's 2 o’clock and I'm faded, this kush feeling amazing
Got a voicemail on my phone from a lil breezy feeling X-rated
She told a nigga she hurting, I'm in the car and I'm swerving
I walked into her bedroom, I put it down that's certain
Man I stay on that Ciroc, man I stay taking shots
Man your girl be on my jock, maybe 'cause I'm everything you're not
See I ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
I'm a real nigga, that's real nigga, I'm just tryna chill 'cause

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
I'm way too high to be tripping like this
I'm way too young to be living like this
Ask me why I do it? I’ma put it like this

[Hook: August Alsina]
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I’ma keep on drinking 'cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on smoking 'cause I luv this shit
And I’ma keep on grinding 'cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fucking 'cause she luv this shit and I luv it

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Rolling through my hood, rolling up some good
Shorty lips be rolling on the wood, damn she rode it good
Rolling over, I ain't sleeping over, now she, rolling the eye
Rolling on the floor laughing 'cause she looks so surprised
Girl, you been around the block, and I been on that Ciroc
Got your man circling your block, maybe 'cause I'm everything you're not
See I ain't no bitch nigga, no rich nigga, no snitch nigga
I'm a real nigga, that's real nigga, I'm just trying to chill 'cause

[Pre-Hook: August]
I'm way too drunk to be talking like this

I'm way too young to be living like this
Ask me why I do it? I'ma put it like this

[Hook: August Alsina]
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
What you know about love? Well love know about you
When I try somethin' new, you refuse to believe that my love is true
So I use all I got to prove to you but the proof ain't enough so you move on
To the next dude like, "What he gon' do?"
I don't understand these girls
I don't understand these girls
Lookin' for a real nigga like in all the wrong places
And all the wrong ways, they don't care, they don't change 'cause
She gon' do what she want and that is okay
And he gon' do what he want and that is okay
I said I luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it
He don't nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' about it, love bitch

[Hook: August Alsina]
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
Goddammit I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I’ma keep on drinking 'cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on smoking 'cause I luv this shit
And I’ma keep on grinding 'cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fucking 'cause she luv this shit and I luv it
