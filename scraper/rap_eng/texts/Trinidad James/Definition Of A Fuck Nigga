[Intro: Lil Debbie]
All y'all bum ass bitches always talking about you need a real one
Why you gon' pick up your man at the bus stop
Take him to Denny's like it's a five-star restaurant and shit
You feel me?
Hell naw I ain't fucking with no bum asses
You not finna hop in my whip and smoke my shit for free

Straight from Oakland motherfucking California
You feel me?
Straight up and down like that
All you basic ass bitches need to get you a real one

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
Check it
Remember what I told you, bitch I'm the man
Got a couple Ginas but I really want a pam

Don't be scared lil nigga, cause the way she poppin'
Every night I party but we keep it on the low
She wanna look good, puttin' powder on her nose
She wanna have fun puttin' powder in her nose
My homeboy the plug man he got it for the low
She brought her boyfriend, hope she leave him at the door
Cause' we don't really like him and hope a nigga know
And if you bring the beef we put his ass in the stove
My nigga don't trip she wanna get chose

[Hook: Trinidad James]
Girl fuck your boyfriend, I know you ain't happy
I know you need a real nigga and I can make it happen
Girl fuck your boyfriend, I know you ain't happy

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
She said that he be trickin' all his motherfuckin' dough

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
She said that he bitchin', hell yeah he be bitchin'

And ever since she met me man she tell me I'm a blessin
And everytime he call [?] man that be stressin’
Send em to the voicemail, nigga leave a message
She don’t pick the phone up, nigga get to textin’
Real life fuck nigga by the definition
Call him form the block nigga you a pussy
When you walk by man know that we be lookin’
And if she give it up you better know that we be fuckin’
So if you love the pussy boy you better gon’ follow it
When she gets some good dick nigga she gon’ swallow it
Make her take her drawers off throw em to the floor
We ain’t make the bedroom, I fucked her on the stove
I don’t like your girlfriend, I don’t want your ho
You be in the DM’s, I’ll be in her throat

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Problem]

Still ain’t learned his lesson, fucking pussy no condom

Come deal with a winner, he ain’t gotta know
