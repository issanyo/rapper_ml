[Hook]
Killers in my house, smokin' on killer
Ridin' in my killer broad in my car, killer

[Verse 1 - Curren$y]
And we still slingin' raps like crack
Suckas don't like that
We don't like 'em back
So we continue to stack, stay paid
Long as I stay alive and black
Highway ridin'
Homie, I'm swingin' like a bat
In and out of lanes
Kids hollerin', what's that
A dream on wheels
Pimpin', I made it real
Established in 2008
We was major without a major deal
First they tried to play him
And now they gotta pay him
For real

[Hook]
Everything I do, I kill it

[Verse 2 - Trinidad James]
Dick and James please
I'm so new in the game
But doing my own thing really matters
I go by James
I give no fucks
I believe in my dreams
And my dreams came through, haha, kill it
I've been a player for so long
I know how this game played
You'll never see me on a bench
Starting five starting five
Notes ?
Paper, no plastic
Better than your address
Just say I'm better than your average
Nigga up on your block now
Old school feel
Nigga, OG dreams
Got me oh so trill
Jets Gold Gang, that's the new ordeal
I said, Jets Gold Gang, that's the new ordeal
Bitch
