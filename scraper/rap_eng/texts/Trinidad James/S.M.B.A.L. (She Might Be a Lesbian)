[Intro: Trinidad James]
Trust me

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
You think all these women faithful, that's a facade
You can get played in this game, going too hard
She can have kids and a husband working two jobs
Still fuck another nigga, damn that bitch got [?]
Two phones, two cars
Too many wrong examples
She's taking it too far
She's dealing with her demons
Makeup for the new scar
She's flying coast to coast
She gotta do the most
She take your check and go
You a Comedy Central roast
You a king, you supposed to gloat
I forgot, you ain't shit
You the one that built the boat
Momma's boy, you a pro
The honor roll of having hoes
Complicated, let them go
Nigga, she's coming for your soul

[Hook: Lyric Wright]
You been doing damage
Turned a rose into a savage
I thought I was a bad bitch
But you treat me like I'm average
Look what you did to me
Look what you did to me
Now I don't even play for your team
No more
Look what you did to me
Look what you did to me
Now I don't even play for your team
No more

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Asking questions, but the answers, you don't wanna know
Or where I'm at or who I'm with, you sure you wanna know?
'Cause every nigga gotta lose and every good girl gotta learn
That every bad bitch got a date and she gonna catch you winning
If it ain't your man, then she gonna get your friend
If she can't get your friend, then she gonna get your family
Your cousin hit, your brother fucking
Now she on the daddy
She ate your sister pussy
Shit, we ain't even know she was lesbian
Will she make it? Can she make it?
Man, we will never know
'Cause bitches keep tricks and niggas keep hoes
And if all you want do is fuck, then nigga, say so
And if you wanna fuck a man, damn baby, say so

[Hook: Lyric Wright]
You been doing damage
Turned a rose into a savage
I thought I was a bad bitch
But you treat me like I'm average
Look what you did to me
Look what you did to me
Now I don't even play for your team
No more
Look what you did to me
Look what you did to me
Now I don't even play for your team
No more
