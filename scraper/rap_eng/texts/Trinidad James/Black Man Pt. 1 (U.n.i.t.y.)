[Intro]
U.N.I
Yeah, U.N.I

[Hook]
You don't got to  read between the lines to
Realize what we need
You don't got to read between the lines to
Realize what we need
You don't have to read between the lines to
Realize what we need
A little bit of U.N.I.T.Y. (X4)
A little less of me and more you and I (X4)

[Break: Trinidad James]
Unity is what all communities need
It doesn't matter the color of your skin
Don't let that racial chip hold you down
From going where you want to go
Help the next man and together we will rise

(Black Man!) (X4)

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
(Black Man!) You gotta tell 'em what you want
Keep inside no cage we ain't monkeys no more
We fight for creativity we ain't fighting your war
Be a queen queen, you ain't gotta be a ho
I say what I want, but I'm keeping it real
Freedom of speech really ain't that free
So when you say what you want
You gottta say it in secret
Ignoring the obvious but I know that you see it

[Break: Trinidad James]
Hey, I know that you see it
Ignoring the obvious but I know that you see it
Ignoring the problem but I know that we see it
If you don't acknowledge then you the reason
Put your fist up!
And I know that you see it
Ignoring the obvious but I know that you see it
Ignoring the problem but I know that we see it
If you don't acknowledge then you the reason
Straight up!

[Hook]

[Break: Trinidad James]
I got love for the youths in Chicago
I got love for the youths in Detroit
I got love for the youths in New York
I got love for the youths all around the world
I love the president but fuck the government
'Cuz if it ain't a budget, they ain't budging
Straight up (I got love)

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Black man, kill a black man
Over the fakest fucking chain or a dice game
Crips killing Crips, is that really love?
Favorite color red, so now you a Blood?
(Fuck outta here)
Miss me with that
Fighting the power, strapped in black
Just to find the hour and who got your back
Is it a black man or is it a strap?
(Blaow blaow blaow)
This ain't no black, white, chinese thang
Got love for my mexicans and every race
All around the world we gotta stick together
I don't see a color, all I see is a brother

[Break: Trinidad James]
Cause my public enemy is not the man next to me
But actually the man above is looking down on me
And if we ain't for that, we gotta stand together
Hey!
(And if we ain't for that, we gotta stand together) (X3)

[Hook]

(I got love) (X4)

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Uh, I never was the type to look away from the obvious
Pain they put on my people
Just to change the fact that we kings and queens
Stronger than the images they put on big screens
Reckless showin' niggas knowing that Tyler Perry family reunions we never had
Instead we got to rhyme to reminisce on the past
Of our poor righteous teachers
Community needs us to be better role models
And more leaders, we on it
Stand for the call, live for the moment
As long as I'm breathing
I'm fighting for freedom against my opponent
They want me to slave it out
Throw us in cages
Until history majors skip over the pages of our culture
'cuz we too busy killing up each other
Heard another unarmed brother got smuggled
Another memorial and crying mother
Black folk in trouble
Damn
