[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
They ask me how I get it
Simple, pimpin'
All whoever step in front of me
Niggas or bitches
My caliber a fifty
She's sittin' at the table with me [?]
High class pimpin'
High times when I'm twistin'
When I talk, she listen
Yo bitch says she ready to join
Cuz my team winnin'
Heh, yeah I'm runnin' circles 'round these niggas, man
Got your bitch in my trap
Walkin' round in her G-strings
Got the talk back in trafic
Smoking on the loudest weed
And my pistol plastic
My life's cinematic
She throwin' that pussy at me
But I won't catch it
I told her I got a 100 pounds
"I need you to go and fetch it"
