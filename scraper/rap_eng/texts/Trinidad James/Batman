[Intro]
Mixtape monopoly, fuck, nigga!
Pull up, pull up
You already know it is nigga
Might pull up in the exclusive whip
Might pull up with the exclusive bitch
Might be your bitch
New Bruce Wayne, nigga

[Hook: Trinidad James & Travis Scott]
Black batmobile, I fly without steering (steering)
Gave my momma a hundred thousand, told her "keep it" (straight up)
Can't see me and the kids get to screaming
Batman, batman, straight up

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
My car got an attitude don't pull up next to it
My bitch get an attitude ain't givin' her no dick
All my Jordans early I ain't campin' out for shit
I got all my niggas from the streets off in this bitch
I be so damn fly I might need a whistle
Throwin' 1's in Magic City tryna feed the strippers
And if your niggas ain't shit then leave them niggas
And if your bitch get on your nerves then take her to a circus

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
I'm the best, just best keep secrets
Just three stacks and Hendrix, nigga
No guitar, and God's my witness
Dick and James, bring back cathedral
Man, these shoes, it's just illegal
Boast these hoes, it's Tommy Lee
That's two face all you niggas, James

[Hook: Trinidad James & Travis Scott]
Black batmobile, I fly without steering (I'm steering)
Gave my momma a hundred thousand, told her "keep it" (straight up)
Can't see me and the kids get to screaming
Batman, batman, straight up
Black batmobile, I fly without steering (I'm steering)
Gave my momma a hundred thousand, told her "keep it" (straight up)
Can't see me and the kids get to screaming
Batman, batman

[Verse 3: Trini G]
Man, I don't ball, you know I do not talk
Might run the boat under the tank
You are everydance, you left Vietnam
Cook you from the feels, cook you in a pan
I'm go me gun them all of the time
I quickly clap crosbitter mind
Watch me on the side, I be polish and shine
Easy synergy, you pank up a line
