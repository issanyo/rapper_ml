[Chorus]
My hoe come with no clothes
My car carry with no doors
Goat, ya'll dance for the dough
Roley got a nigga on the road
Big bag a money make em hating me
Whole lot a one make her shake
She think you can tell by her shape
Ass so fat I might date her
Big bankroll in my pocket
Niggas ain't treating me for Janice
Big bankroll in my pocket
On the white goon bloom profit
Big bankroll in my pocket
Niggas ain't treating me for Janice
Big bankroll in my pocket
On the white goon bloom profit

[Verse 1]
I just got a bag full a money
And I got a room full a bitches
My hoe come with no clothes
My car carry no ceiling
New whip called Cool Penny
And a nigga bought it like Penny
Pull up with the gang at Lenny's
Violate a whoopt with a T
Young rich nigga don't care what it cost
Seen and i wanna grab a bag and a thot
Came from just nothing now boy I have a Porsche
Now I got a whole heavy meal in the vault
I never be quiet cause the money still talking
Beak in the mouth cause the bitch still talking
They see me out like Cody Jabali
Going up a lot lil [?] about it
Bad bitch got a lil nigga too sprung
Strong ass kush heard a lil nigga long
She suck on my dick like she suck on a thong
Water round my neck like  motherfucking pond
Two months money man I got big funds
Two months hating I gotta keep a gun
She gon turn it in when she see a lot a ones
Ain't no trick but I like to have fun

[Chorus]
My hoe come with no clothes
My car carry with no doors
Goat, ya'll dance for the dough
Roley got a nigga on the road
Big bag a money make em hating me
Whole lot a one make her shake
She think you can tell by her shape
Ass so fat I might date her
Big bankroll in my pocket
Niggas ain't treating me for Janice
Big bankroll in my pocket
On the white goon bloom profit
Big bankroll in my pocket
Niggas ain't treating me for Janice
Big bankroll in my pocket
On the white goon bloom profit

[Verse 2]
I got boots cost yo rent bitch
I ain't warm yet
Pictures with yo favorite rapper bitch
I ain't post em yet
I ain't gotta ride a nigga wave
Bitch I'm an ocean
I can sign niggas to my label
Bitch cause I own it, whoo
I'm too clean watch your lipgloss
A whack bitch make my dick soft
Pimp walk, pimp walk
And I got the rocket like criss cross
Got Zoes in my emmy and they all cost
Bitch I'm dead, [?]
Mike Conlee with the loop hand
RIP my nigga Bankroll
Niggas changing T's like we playing 2K
Thousand dollar jeans but yo pocket empty
Used to sell nickel sacks outta Keke house back
Now I make colors scheming up a new paper roll

[Chorus]
My hoe come with no clothes
My car carry with no doors
Goat, ya'll dance for the dough
Roley got a nigga on the road
Big bag a money make em hating me
Whole lot a one make her shake
She think you can tell by her shape
Ass so fat I might date her
Big bankroll in my pocket
Niggas ain't treating me for Janice
Big bankroll in my pocket
On the white goon bloom profit
Big bankroll in my pocket
Niggas ain't treating me for Janice
Big bankroll in my pocket
On the white goon bloom profit
