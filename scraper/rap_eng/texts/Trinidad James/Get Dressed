[Intro: Trinidad Jame$]
(Positive energy, that's all)
Life, rap, it's a game!
Trust me, it's a game
(Fight fire with fire)
Reality is not a game

[Hook: Trinidad Jame$]
Life ain't shit like the rap game, I say, life ain't shit like the rap game (x2)
Life ain't shit like the rap game, so, my nigga, why you rapping? (x2)

[Verse 1: Trinidad Jame$]
I said, my nigga, why you rapping?
Is you tryna make a change or you just want a chain?
I'm just askin' (I'm just askin')
I wish the bombings in Boston never happened
Sometimes I wish, I never started rappin'
It changed how my friends, started actin'
And I ain't never change, since I started rappin'
The crazy shit is, since I started rappin'
Is that the same niggas hatin' is the same niggas clappin'
And the same niggas hatin' is the same niggas rappin'
And I pray for a change, but never seen the action
Maybe, if I pray for a chain, the shit'll quicker happen
Or maybe I'll just pray for a Range, so I can crash it
I just wanna burn in the flames, and live through the ashes (x2)
Cause...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trinidad Jame$]
Niggas trying real hard, but them niggas ain't real
And, when a nigga bein' real, them niggas ain't here
I gotta talk about a whip? 26s on a Chevy?
I gotta talk about a bitch? Now you niggas wanna listen?
Y'all niggas chasin' hits, my niggas chasin' visions
My niggas chasin' liquor, y'all niggas chasin' bitches
And, if yo' life out of frame, nigga, change the picture
And, while you niggas waitin', I'll let my nigga save it

[Interlude: Grammy Society]
(What's up, bruh?)
Bruh, I'mma call you right back, bruh
I'mma do this verse real quick

[Verse 3: Grammy Society]
Life ain't shit like the rap game
If yee ain't spittin' bout ya life, why ya rap, mane?
I graduated out the trap, mane
You a grandaddy long legs to a great dane
You just wanna get a name, maybe make a lil' change
Tryna keep my niggas out the chain, gang
Tellin' me to put him on cause he heard me on the song
Not knowing all along that ya motherfuckin'--

[Hook]
