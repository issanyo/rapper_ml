[Verse 1: BZZY]
Who's that coming from the new school?
Gold chain on like the Juice Crew
This ain't something that used to
Lemme do my one-two, hangin' at the sun roof, I be like "la, la, la, la la"
Wake up, wake up, wake up, BZZY's home (hey)
Shoutout to the DJ this my song (hey)
If my ex can hear this, hit my phone
I'm in my vibe tonight, don't take too long
Honey was thick, I was the first one to kiss (yeah)
[?] we could roll like four, five, six
I'm live tonight, she know how loose I get
I'm hittin' on with [?], I'm hittin' on with [?]
Who got bank? I got three hunnid on it
Life is great, tell the waiter to keep it coming
My luck don't run out, run out
You can see it on my face when I come out

[Chorus]
I feel good, I feel great
I've had too much to drink but who said that's a bad thing?
I feel good (I feel good), I feel great (I feel great)
I've had too much to drink but who said that's a bad thing?
And she like this
And we like this, yeah
And she be like this, yeah (BZZY you know I got you right?)
And she be like this, yeah (Zoey Dollaz)

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
Skip the bullshit and let's get right to it (to it)
How good is your prayer? Shawty let's [?] it (do it)

Listening to "Misery", no I don't need company

But that's cool, I'm that dude, I feel great (great)
Everytime I see her friends but I feel-

[Chorus]
I feel good, I feel great
I've had too much to drink but who said that's a bad thing?
I feel good (I feel good), I feel great (I feel great)
