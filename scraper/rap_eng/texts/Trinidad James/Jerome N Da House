[Intro]
And the dreams that you dream of
Dreams really do come true
Alo-ha (x4)

[Verse 1]
I was in Hawaii in the trees with Yeezys
Praying up to God that Yeezy see me
Mopeds for the team check the scenery
And the Louie store got my name in the system
Fuck the bitch so good I saw my name in the pussy
I'm a real nigga I don't play with you pussies
I'm only talking bitches when I play with some pussy
Only speaking real nigga hope that you feel me
Outfit crazy nigga hope that you see me
BET Awards what's up baby
Flyest freshman with a swag from the 80's
Maybe the 90's don't care if you like me
Every nigga doubting but you just want to sign me
I don't get lucky I got impeccable timing
I say all real gold nigga fuck them diamonds
The nigga with the ugly mouth got hoes smiling hello

[Hook]
Alo-ha (x7)
Ha, ha

[Interlude]
If you know the song sing along

[Verse 2]
Jerome in the house like a [?]
[?]
Outfit cold in my Tommy sneakers
Ya girl all on me nigga check my mentions
She left me a message "Trinidad I need you"
She left you a message "baby I'm on my period"
So my rapping skills really ain't that serious
If you don't worry about your bitch then she'll end up leaving you
Disloyal to your team, they just might leave you
Now they screaming gold gang and yes they serious
How you gon' let a nigga spit that ether
Gon' let a real nigga spit that ether
Gon' let a real nigga spit that ether
Haters in the back ha take this ether
Gon' let a real nigga spit that ether
Gon' let a real nigga spit that ether
Gon' let a real nigga spit that ether
I ain't thirsty for a hit nigga fuck your feature
You can't walk in my shoes they'll fuck your feet up
We working over here nigga fuck that free lunch
Fuck them coupons nigga fuck that slavery
Fuck that bullshit the politicians be claiming
Be a real nigga nigga fuck them handouts
I'm giving you the real nigga, what's your plan now

[Hook]
