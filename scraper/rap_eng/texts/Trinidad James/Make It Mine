I'm about to hit the strip club and make it mine
And if I want the ho I'mma make her mine
Say everywhere I go man I make it mine
Say I'mma make it mine, I'mma make it mine
I'm about to hit the parking lot and make it mine
And if I hit the club I'mma make it mine
Say yeah I'm in yo hood and I make it mine
Oh yeah I make it mine, bitch I make it mine

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
I love all my boppers
About to cop that Lamborghini, them po-po's can't stop me
Niggas think they thowed til they bitch say something about me
And then them niggas know they ain't got, got nothing on me
When I pull up with that lambo, like a nigga at lambeau
That's Brett Farve, that's Aaron Rogers
Got 10 hoes, that's 10 daughters
Uh, they sucking up on a young don
Fucking this bitch and I could be her son
She sucking my dick like she could be the one
But I gotta fuck with my other bitches
My side hoes, they taking pictures, my side hoes they want the issue
I take a ugly ho and make her fine
These bitches they ain't shit until I make them mine

[Hook]
I'm about to hit the strip club and make it mine
And if I want the ho I'mma make her mine
Say everywhere I go man I make it mine
Say I'mma make it mine, I'mma make it mine
I'm about to hit the parking lot and make it mine
And if I hit the club I'mma make it mine
Say yeah I'm in yo hood and I make it mine
Oh yeah I make it mine, bitch I make it mine

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
K-k-Keep that strip club, nigga make it rain
Hit your bitch good make her say James
Ain't no diamonds dancing just these bitches naked
Ain't no answers to yo questions, pussy nigga save it, shut up
Niggas acting different cause a nigga made it
It's a fuck you pay me kind of situation, cash
You ain't got no money let your bitch pay me
With some pussy or some head, I like them grits maybe
I never brag but I just like the shit baby
The hats, the pants, the shoes, I look like Craig Sager
Feeling real trill, nigga I'm coming downnn
Fuck yo parking lot, nigga make it mine, James

[Hook]

And if I hit the club I'mma make it mine
Say yeah I'm in yo hood and I make it mine
Oh yeah I make it mine, bitch I make it mine
