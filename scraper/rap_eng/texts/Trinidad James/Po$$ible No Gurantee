[Spoken Word]
There are three types of men in this world
Ones that want the perfect girl
Ones that just want a girl
And of course, the ones that just want some pussy
And there's nothing wrong with either three
Based off of, or according to, their reasons in action
Learn to accept the opposite sex for who they are
Don't linger in cancerous relationships
Or dwell on anything that can turn negative
Dwelling on things you cannot overcome is meaningless
Continue on to dwell though
Because what I have come to reason with
Or better yet, understand is, comfort is one of the key pieces to life
Less stress equals more life
My theory is that we can never be perfect because of sin
But we can reach our mind and bodies own version of that perfected state
The feeling of being mentally perfect
Is better than being literally perfect in my personal opinion
And based off of my studies of human nature
I feel like life works better
When you have to work for your peace slash comfort
Many people would disagree and I understand why initially
A red flag in your mind would wave back and fourth
Many people in the world have success and wealth
And many many more want the same thing
Achieving these fantasies can take you down the same roads
While on your road though
I want you to always try to remember one key thing
Appreciate the peace you currently possess
Nothing at all is wrong with focusing on your future
Or even wanting better things in the future
But don't allow those future goals slash fantasies
To tamper with your current success
What you're gonna understand one day, or the next
Is that no matter what you want in this future
It will always be based on what you are doing in the present
The present is very important
The future cannot work without the present
Now after my mini 101 on life and living it
Have any of these three types of men listed above
Ever come into your life or reside in it currently?
I'm a libra so I'll address the females
That are currently in a stable relationship first
No diss to single women, but the purpose of these words
Are to motivate your conscious to understand
Who the woman in your heart really is
As humans in general I really truly feel it is very important
For you to know who you really are
Very important the more you know yourself
The more you know what you won't go for
Whether it is jobs or friends or even food
Last but not least when it comes to self understanding
You will have the best grip possible
When it comes to relationships
Relationships matter so much in my personal opinion
Because being lonely is something
The mind has to be forced to understand
I feel that we were meant to be with someone at least
Something 2 or 3 (haha)
But to each his own
Any time the opposite sex can make you a certain type of way
And there's a reason behind that
Positives are always looking for a positive
But will take a negative, because there is always a possibility
They can make them a positive
Possible, but no guarantee
