[Hook: Trinidad James]
These shoes Balenciaga, nigga these ain't Louis
Met a bitch at Benihana's, took that bitch to Privé
Go to Clark Atlanta but she got a Spelman booty
Shoppin' at Lenox, shoppin' at Phipps, all my bitches bougie
Shoppin' at Lenox, shoppin' at Phipps, all my bitches bougie
Shoppin' at Lenox, shoppin' at Phipps, all my bitches bougie
Shoppin' at Lenox, shoppin' at Phipps, all my bitches bougie
Shoppin' at Lenox, shoppin' at Phipps, all my bitches bougie

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
She surfboard like Beyoncé, baby girl I got that new wave
Broke a hundred, left the rest, my nigga I don't do change
Chillin' with a model, this bitch tall as fuck like 2 Chainz
And she suck me up so good, I kept her 'round for two days
Gave that bitch to Offset then he dropped her off with Longway
Left that bitch on Cleveland Ave. with ashy knees and no pay
All I know is get the cash and stay down with my homies
Tell that bitch stop actin' bougie, come and show that pussy

[Hook: Trinidad James]

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
High priced bitch with an attitude
Rockin' Balenciagas, Jimmy Choos
Givenchy chilla diamond, bird flew
Slangin' cocaine out a old school
My bitch is a bougie, she'll dent in your roof
Bendin' blue Benjamins, safari shoes
Fuckin' on [?], makin', breakin' new
Ran through that bitch like we're thirty deep
Cargo pockets on me, 30 in each
MPA the [?], they thinkin' we're Meech
Traphouse stay beat but we never offbeat
Bougie bitches on this boy like a leech
Suck a good dick for Balenciagas
All white, mothafuckin' Lady Gaga
They gon' overdose on sweaters
Super cool, Fonzarelli leather

[Hook: Trinidad James]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Balenciaga, cookin' the dope like it's steak hibachi
My money colossal
Workin' the trap, never went to a college
Christopher Wallace, Versace, Versace
Got a mansion with 50 acres
Christian Louboutin, alligator
Givenchy khaki, skinned and got 'em tailored
Sippin' on Actavis, drinkin' maple
My bitch got her nose up, bougie
Flea market shoes, who you foolin'?
Hyena all up on my Louboutins
Fresher than mannequins, pockets on Ruger
Your diamonds ain't real, that's an illusion
You think that my swag got your bitch Jimmy Choosin'
You think I'm a Timberland cause I be booted
You can't afford my bitch cause she's too bougie
