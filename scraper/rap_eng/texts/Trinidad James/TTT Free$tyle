[Verse]
This real nigga shit will get televised
Please do not speak, you not authorised
Sit yo’ ass in the seat ‘til told otherwise
Otherwise we gon’ get ill in this bitch
You a lil bitty bitch, you a lil bitty bitch
I'm full blown fame with the fashion shit
My nigga, you are not even lit
I try and tell these sucker time again
Tell these sucker time and time again
I’m a hustler, hustler nigga, not your friend
Hustlin’ three hard just to pay the rent
I need a Carib symbol with some miracle
I got a winner’s background so she gotta be spiritual
Last days is the final hour
Your bitch get deep down then pass out like watchtower
This real nigga shit, boy it’s not over
This real nigga shit, boy these not stories
Tell your bitch keep her legs closed
She leave ‘em open, I’ll Kyle Korver
I'm L.James in my own lane and these pussy niggas know they can’t hold me
I'm not joking with these lil niggas, I'm not playing with these lil niggas
Right hand on a swisher maybe, left hand going rollie crazy
All my bitches on a K Camp
Got money, money, money, money baby
ASAP forever and never forget it
Trinidad show niggas how to get jiggy
For [?] I need keys to the city
Got all the game fucking-fucking with me
From the [?] bloods to the rolling sixties
Ain’t shit changed? Ain’t shit different?
Dedicated and so committed
Can’t focus on failure or none of these niggas
Fashion fool, man they fucking these bitches
Ooh, for all is worth, ooh, [?]
Golden cashiers and supreme shirts
Mona Davis with the wrist work
Whipping it, whipping but no slaying
[?] for the new J’s
It’s a new way, it’s a new day
I'm not tryna’ bring hip-hop back (no), we got Kendrick for that (yes sir)
I’m not tryna’ save rap (no), we got Drake for that (OVO)
Him, Ye, Jay, Drake is all I play, no disrespect to other niggas
But I can’t relate (no, no), but I can’t relate
Maybe it’s me or it’s just my [?]
Niggas flex so much everyday
But I'mma sip my tea and sit quietly
[?] for you niggas favorite bitches [?]
Momma love me, that’s the biggest difference nigga
Rather be a one hit wonder than a no hit nigga
I have [?], James
