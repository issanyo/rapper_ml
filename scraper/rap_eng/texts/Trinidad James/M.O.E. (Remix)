[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
And it’s M.O.E. baby
Money over everything and that’s what it be baby, ha!
And they ain’t flier than me baby, ha!
And I’m getting money pay me baby, yeah!
And my rims real big
And my house is real big
And my money’s real long, ha!
And it’s M.O.E. baby
Money over everything and that’s what it be baby

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
And I’m flyer than a pelican
And I’m fresher than I ever been
And I’m higher than I ever been
And I ain’t motherfucking stuttering
I ain’t like these other niggas
I really sold that butter man
And boy you still gotta get touched up
And it’s fuck your family feelings, I’m like tough luck
And I ain’t never light, no little money like megabucks
And I ain’t with no simple girl, I like mega sluts
I’m coming at niggas, like they owe me
I hear ‘em talking real gangster, I’m like show me
24 all in your chest, they call him Kobe
But I don’t really wanna get back to the old me

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
And it’s M.O.E. baby
Money over everything and that’s what it be baby, ha!
And they ain’t flier than me baby, ha!
And I’m getting money pay me baby, yeah!
And my rims real big
And my house is real big
And my money’s real long, ha!
And it’s M.O.E. baby
Money over everything and that’s what it be baby

[Verse 2: Trinidad Jame$]
I can't wait to do a song with Boosie, straight outta jail
And them niggas hatin' on me 'cause I'm giving 'em hell
And them bitches lovin' on me since I'm dressin' so well
I remember coming up I had to hussle for real
Many houses up that line I had whatever for sale
What I couldn't afford I made a promise nigga would self
I'ma grind it, run it up and have my mama turnt up
Real nigga? Yes sir
Fake nigga? Hate ya
So you can keep running your mouth nigga (haha)
And I'ma keep making these songs nigga
Your bitch gon' sing along nigga
You want that power, that respect
It's money over everything bitch

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
And it’s M.O.E. baby
Money over everything and that’s what it be baby, ha!
And they ain’t flier than me baby, ha!
And I’m getting money pay me baby, yeah!
And my rims real big
And my house is real big
And my money’s real long, ha!
And it’s M.O.E. baby
Money over everything and that’s what it be baby

[Verse 3: Ca$h Out]
And my team, I won’t trade for nothing
Man I was on the block, grinding hard like I was a slave or something
Man I’m trying to get my crop up
They slow don’t run the stock up
Now they pay me for pop ups nigga
But don’t make me pop up
‘Cause bodies they won’t pop up
Niggas they get mopped up
And we don’t call him hitman, we call him cleaners
Watch these niggas ass up then put ‘em in the cleaners
Nas missing picture sayin’ “Have you seen him?”
Jury blinded all these bitches they like “We can’t see ‘em”
And I know these niggas hatin but they wanna be ‘em
And I swear I play with weight like I was in the gym

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
And it’s M.O.E. baby
Money over everything and that’s what it be baby, ha!
And they ain’t flier than me baby, ha!
And I’m getting money pay me baby, yeah!
And my rims real big
And my house is real big
And my money’s real long, ha!
And it’s M.O.E. baby
Money over everything and that’s what it be baby
