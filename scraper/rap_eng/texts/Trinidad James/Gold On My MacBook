Yeah I dropped a tape
Surprised myself man

Other than fucking amazing
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Let me give you lil' bio by the southside nigga
I like my bitches on their back with their mouth wide nigga

I must do what I feel
I can't afford to get caught in a bullshit that life brings
A young woman always told me it's your choice how you choose to react

So I hit the the club and I turn up

Kicking shit up your party
Ain't bothering nobody
You couldn't kick shit no better
Your main bitch?
She a choke artist like Webber
It wasn't hard for her to notice me
My James Hardened like OKC
As she hit them high notes like Jodeci
I'mma shoot the guts

Knowing me
Knowing me
This is a good lil' journey you finna to take right here
It's gonna take you somewhere you never been
Hopefully
You know what I'm saying
