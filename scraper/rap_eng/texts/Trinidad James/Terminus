OK lets get it straight
Who be the little nigga you know
Barely 5'6 way above Kuno
Had to pop up in this motherfucker like Juno
{?}  any topic pack your extra kudos
I can blow a few O's
Stretch a few toes
See I made it If I upgraded to that Volvo
But, she going still ride with a nigga though
Set it up high for a nigga though
Tell her girlfriends bye bye hit me on the phone
But, that shit might be out though
Ride with my man and he off some
And we ride right behind the police so I know he feel better than a cashmere sweater
Bet when we get home he going to take my panties off throw them hoes in the shredder nothing makes my pussy wetter
Lord Please tell a nigga when its going to get better
Cause see an empty prayer turn to a message
Why you sitting  guessing, I've been there before
Blunt think session, Front street stressing, I don't want that bitch
{?} team ready, you'd be parched though, Mr. Serengeti
Whole heme steady, Aim it like whoa, now we out cold
And the shit done got nasty like a couple of pig ears
Clutch time phone managed to switch gears
Still humbled in a broken Brian Gumble
Steady giving {?} like Rapunzel
Man I wish I wish I wish it had to come to a realization these vision that I'm chasing got a nigga pacing back and fourth
But, of course from the shit I'm facing, Travel 50 {?}
I'll probably be somewhere and run into Sanaa Lathan
You know I'm smiling big timing throwing up dollar signs
And though my heart thinking we still have relations
Now her heart aching viscous cycle ain't it
Back to the subject, stayed in the budget, then the shit start bubbling
Now my checks looking like a cross dressing Rick Ross man and that's way to ugly
Y'all going to love me , Y'all going to love me, I might of digressed
I might of died yes But, that's the process
You use your semi automatic to get shit of your chest
I use my pen we automatic to get in off the rep
And Yep

Life ain't shit like the rap game
I say Life ain't shit like the rap game

Life ain't shit like the rap game

Life ain't shit like the rap game
So my nigga why you rapping?

Niggas tried real hard
But, them niggas ain't real
And when a nigga be real
Them niggas ain't here
I gotta talk about whip
26s on a Chevy
I gotta talk about a Bitch
Now you Niggas want to Listen
Y'all niggas chasing hits
My niggas chasing visions
My niggas chasing liquor
Y'all niggas chasing bitches
And if your life out of frame
Nigga change the picture
And while you niggas wait
I let my niggas safe

[Hook; Trinidad James]
Life ain't shit like the rap game

Life ain't shit like the rap game
So my nigga why you rapping?
Life ain't shit like the rap game
So my nigga why you rapping?

[Doctor Dot]
All she wanted was a life free of judgement
Spend her nights in the home of the bud-man
Skin tone deeper than the seven layers of hell
When she lay in her bed you know she play with herself and
Truth be told she was raised rather well
She's such a Daddy's Girl, She's such a Daddy's Girl
And Papa did her proper kept her off the street
Ironically, that sure did help her become a freak so
Now she dancing in the middle of room, feeling like she is floating thanks to the Quaalude
And I can see behind them laminated eyes there's a mind of a lioness defying this time
Its cats and dogs, retractable claws, she digging in my shoulder blade as I fuck her hard against the wall
And I ain't even go a number to call
Shit, I don't even know her name at all
Only thing we got in common is the problems to this planet and the damage that causes to our souls
So forgive me if I spit a hole straight through your skull and ask if my saliva is getting out of control
Its the Dolby digital, fuck a bitch or two, pop a pill, fuck the world
Go to war, A generation
And I'm just chilling with my headphones on so please respect the fact that I ain't here for conversation
It seems like all you niggas do is take pictures
And all my niggas do is take bitches
She pussy popping on the counter in the kitchen
And then we spill it
Hieroglyphic lifted

Life ain't shit like the rap game
