[Hook: Trinidad James] x2
I, I can't wait on no nigga
You, nigga you a fuck nigga
I stay countin' up nigga
Young Scooter, Trinidad, turnt up nigga

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I put that street money with that rap money
And put that Gucci money with that Hectar money
You show me your Gucci money, everybody gunnin'
Lil Mexico city, we print our own money
Count a lot of free band with Mexico Rann
Witness me buy a M6 with no advance
Witness me hit a lot of licks with no mask
You runnin' out of money, start finessin'
I, Scooter got his own money
You, nigga you a crash dummy
I, all I want is more money
They take the Rolls off the streets, I got the Volks comin'
