[Trinidad Jame$]
Bitch, lemme tell you a story about how
I popped a molly, got in the booth
And start spitting that fire
And now nigga, I ain’t lying
I ain’t made it yet, but I’m trying
I'm just looking for, who craving molly
And the fuck niggas who buying
I’m your favorite club supplier
My cousin got that 40 cal and I dare a nigga to try 'em
I put that on everything, fuck nigga, you’re dying!
But I ain’t about that monkey shit
I rather kick shit with your bitch
With not top, indecent

[Corey Davis]
Who you’re rolling with? It’s time to represent
My chick’s so elegant, I’m feeling like the President!
Motherfuck the government, kill an undercover cop
I’ll be out here hustling for years, I could never stop!
So what the fuck you want, hoe?
Blowing hell of skunk smoke
Hard boxing in the parking lot, gas running low!
Greedmont Goon Squad, bitch I stay up on my job
Your girl treat me like a god, got her slobbing on my knob

[Chorus]
Nigga, who you’re rollin with?
Nigga, who you’re rollin with?
Nigga, who you’re rollin with?
Nigga, who you’re rollin with?

[A.ware]
I’m rolling with my niggas who was with me since the dirt
(Since the dirt!)
I’m rolling with my niggas who was with me, hurt
(We was hurt!)
Rolling with the niggas who was with me
Thick and thin, fuck the bullshit
I gotta stay up on my focus!
Stay away from them vultures
They’re just jacking our culture
My Jewish bitch eating kosher
I’mma have me a steak tho!
Filet mignon, Magic girl, keep waving that wond
Help me get my brother that bond money
She so sweet as milk and honey!
I got my famo to the end and that’s the truth!
They smoking stank, I’m sipping on that hundred proof. (hundred proof)
These bitches busting down, don’t know what else to do. (what to do)
Your chick will do the same around real niggas too! (yeah!)
That’s my shit, (that’s my shit)
It’s pimping mane. (pimping mane)
Born in Chicago, you know it’s pimping mane
I got my stripes up now i got my right to
Spaz on any nigga that come at us and that shit ain't righteous

[Bridge]
Break it down, pass the blunt
Crank the hen, let’s get fucked up!
Break it down, pass the blunt
Crank the hen, let’s get fucked up!
Break it down, pass the blunt
Crank the hen, let’s get fucked up!
Break it down, pass the blunt
Crank the hen, let’s get fucked up!
