[Hook x2: Quavo]
Trap house stankin'
Trap house stankin'
Trap house stankin'
Trap house stankin'
All this gas (x6)
All this godamn gas

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Trap house stankin'
What the fuck do you think?
Walk around the club with a great migo bank
What's in that car?
Lean, lean lean lean
I just take the pot, skrr skrr like a machine
Walk inside my bando, better hold your nose
Went to the jeweler, green diamonds guacamole
That Trinidad, talking about he's just on gold
That young Takeoff, talking about he bout to smash 2 hoes
Pack, make it work, gotta wrap it like Bin Laden
Hit the plug I'm running with a sack, Quavo McFadden
My neighbour keep knocking on the door, saying trap house stankin'
I said bitch, what the fuck do you think?
I shut the door, kept trapping anyway

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Medusas, shinin'
Designer, (?)
Too high, Chinese
Two blunts, siamese
I got yo bitch up on this gas and nigga she like
She know the Migos gotta smash nigga she psych
She want Benihanas, she want Hibashi
She want that Rolex, she want Versace
She blow my phone like nigga call me
She want a man, but bitch it's not me
James!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I'm trapping and capping, finessing your blessing
That Smith & Wesson will (?)
I'm cooking that dope like a hamburger
Selling that white Cinderella
Trap house stankin'
Drink lean by the pint
It's Takeoff, I'ma migo so I'm fucking around with that sack
I step on yo niggas like ants
Ball like Kevin Durant
Take yo bitch, break up her back
Plug Uncle sam so I got tax

And trap like (?)
We trapping in bandos across the map
Finesse you, make you a (?)
