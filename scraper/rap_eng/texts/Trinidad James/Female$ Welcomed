[Intro: Trinidad James]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
Now my side bitch my main bitch
'Cause my main ho ain't feeling me no mo', no mo'
Now my side bitch my main bitch
'Cause my main ho ain't feeling me no mo', no mo'
Now my side bitch my main bitch
'Cause my main ho ain't feeling me no mo', no mo'

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
James, I said...
Fuck love it's overrated
Was disfellowshiped, now I'm reinstated
Might need a witness, these bitches crazy
Let me say it again (these bitches crazy)
Fucked her once, now I'm Swayze
Fucked her twice (now I'm Swayze)
Put my partner on, he got her pregnant
Man fuck life, life ignorant
Might need a cigarette, that newport (that newport)
Got new shoes, got new clothes
Need new hoes (need new hoes)
Like old school, with two doors
I'm Too Short (I'm Too Short)
Too clean for them photos
So please do not snap those
Got my hands up with my eyes closed
Your girl head down with her mouth open
I'm in my tank top with my pants open
She still going (she still going)
Say "Ay bruh, what you wanna do"
Say "Ay bruh (what you want to do)"
We got bad bitches and a ton of brew
Nigga we the truth, they loving the crew

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
Now my side chick my main chick
'Cause my main girl ain't feelin' me no mo', no mo'
Now my side chick my main chick
'Cause my main girl ain't feelin' me no mo', no mo'
Now my side chick my main chick
'Cause my main girl ain't feelin' me no mo', no mo'
Now my side chick my main chick
'Cause my main girl ain't feelin' me no mo', no mo'

[Drop: Trinidad James]
No mo', no mo', no mo', no mo'
No mo', no mo', no mo', no mo'
No mo', no mo', no mo', no mo'
No mo'-mo'-mo'-mo'-mo'-mo'-mo'-mo'

[Chorus: Trinidad James]
Now my side chick my main chick
'Cause my main girl ain't feelin' me no mo', no mo'
Now my side chick my main chick
'Cause my main girl ain't feelin' me no mo', no mo'
Now my side chick my main chick
'Cause my main girl ain't feelin' me no mo', no mo'
Now my side chick my main chick
'Cause my main girl ain't feelin' me no mo', no mo'

[Outro: Reija Lee]
Boy, don't you know, take it slow
Work it hard, take it far
Boy, don't you know, take it slow
Work it hard, take it far
Boy, I can see it in your face, you're all over the place
Can you stand up straight for me, yeah
Get it back on track if you want me back
Don't you know
Do the sweet, do the sweet talk
Talk, do the sweet talk
Boy, don't you know, take it slow
Work it hard, take it far
Boy, don't you know, take it slow
Work it hard, take it far
