[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
Gucci cross my body
Black and gold my outtie
Flexin' in the hills
Don't nobody call me
You call that bitch wife
I think that she average
Take a knee and hit that pussy, call me Colin Kaepernick
Cash out for a feature
We ain't showin' love
D boys swear they gangsta
D boys undercover
Give me head in the coupe
I feel like a rock star
Give me head in the booth
I need that for writer's block
Gold rims flex
I got Midas touch
Gold teeth flex
I got ice box
My wrist super sick
It got small pox
You a yes man
You don't call no shots
Your bitch is a super freak
Savage on the cock
That bitch call me every week
I had to get a block

[Verse 2: Mo Eazy]
Whip it up in like a second
Cooking up, I'm always cheffing
Curry thotties cause I'm Stephen
Momo DC what im reppin'
Stay outta [?] like im [?]
January to December
Steady grind it's never end it
You ain't did it for a minute
Had it poppin' in the beginnin'
Ain't she was intendin'
Well
Big blunts cookies in it
Head chief the lieutenant
Made a hit with no permission
Niggas looking at me crazy like who is this nigga my nigga
Sour
I got money, I got power
I just rolled a zip of dour
Had to drop a [?]
New Black iPhone 7 flex tell 'em
