[Hook: F.A.M.]
Niggas, niggas, talking 'bout licks [x6]

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Old money flow, yeah I did mine bigger
Apeshit flow so King Kong, nigga
You got big money, man? How long nigga
Can't talk right now, I'm in Hong Kong, nigga
My Polo rounds, fuck her for only a photo now
Skin is so cinnamon, Cocoa Brown
Wanna be me, but they don't know how; so profound
Who cares what they be on, I'm in the sun with aviators on
My favorite song, I came to ball
And aim at y'all, you know the semi-automatic with no safety on
Bow down, my ladies want a shout out
Take her, flip her over, lower back I leave that blah-dow
Ass backwards, Kris Kross
T-rex, Chris Bosh
Nigga we eating so Rick Ross
Brown rice, fish sauce
Fly as a kite, man, I must be
Claiming to be what them thugs be
These niggas is making it dusty
Cause I'm aiming at you like I just sneezed
