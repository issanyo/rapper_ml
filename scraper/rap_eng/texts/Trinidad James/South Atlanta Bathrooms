[Intro]

[Verse 1]
What's illuminati to a nigga like me?
Who ain't never seen a check bigger than 2 G's
Got 3D dreams and a 2D screen
Want to pay my momma's rent by spitting sweet 16's
I'm kush, no seeds, [?]
My girl pussy pink like South Beach [?]
My girl pussy pink like South Beach [?]
I never get any credit for my punch line
And the way I had my niggas in my lunch line
If my whip was dead, you couldn't jump mine
My bitch give head til the sun shines
Want to do it big for the city just one time
ATL like [?]
See my picture on [?], her pussy been wet ever since

[Hook] x2
Let me take you on a trip
Let me take you on a trip
Let me take you on a trip
Of a young nigga getting it

[Verse 2]
Am I tripping? Maybe
Am I tripping? Nah
I'm a 404 nigga, ATL [?]
A place where niggas catch you slipping
Finesse your bitch [?]
You blink twice then that bitch, she missed it
Woah, woah, woah
When you look at me, you better know something
[?] she better move something
My camera will shoot something
These niggas sick, the flu coming
They yelling "Oh lord, the flue coming"
They yelling "Oh lord, the flue coming"
Had to finish the verse on a toilet bowl
Cause I'm shitting on these niggas

[Hook] x2
