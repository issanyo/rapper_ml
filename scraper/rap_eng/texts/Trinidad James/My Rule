[Intro: Trinidad James]
You got to be who you want to be despite what they tell you got to be
Alright fuck everybody
My life (x7)

[Pre-Hook: Trinidad James]
I said my life is a highway
Stay the fuck out of my lane
These are my rules this is my way
You don't like it you can fly away

[Hook: K-Major]
I drink when I wanna, stunt when I wanna
Fuck when I want, smoke a blunt when I wanna
Fly away when I wanna, when I wanna

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
Please don't hold us down, please don't hold me up
They try to shut us all down we done had enough
We just want to have fun, we just want to live it up
Overtime and overtime hey, trying to get it up
If I can't be me now, then who am I, who am I
If I can't be me now, then who am I, who am I

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Break: Trinidad James]
We won't stop, we can't stop
I promise, that't the only way its going to be forever

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Outro: Trinidad James & (K-Major)]
And when we wanna cry
We smile cause we just so much better than that
Amen
(No more tears, no more tears)
