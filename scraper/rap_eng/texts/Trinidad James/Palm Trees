[Intro]
Ah, all the way from A-Town to the great California
Ha-ha, from L.A. to the Bay

[Pre-Hook]
Palm trees make California
Pa-palm trees make California
Pa-palm trees make California
Pa-palm trees make California

[Hook]
I said, palm trees make California
I feel like palm trees make California
I said, palm trees make California
I feel like palm trees make California

[Verse 1]
I say, I'm L.A.X., flexin', I need Roscoe's
I like my bitches from the Bay a little hostile
You better speak when the gangsta in your face
Cause these L.A. niggas don't play at all
I'm in Hollywood tryin' to get to Slauson
Smokin' on Fairfax, I'm 'bout to make a mall run
I'm a nigga though, no, I'm in the Beverly
Spendin', that's your money
Broke niggas, show me somethin'
I keep a homo though and get it on the low
A thick can't get it on the floor
A skinny girl, man, can get it on the stove
Malibu the week and stay for courtside
Feelin' like a boss

[Bridge 1]
Feelin' like a boss, f-feelin' like a boss
Sittin' on the courtside, feelin' like a boss
Feelin' like a boss, f-feelin' like a boss
Sittin' on the courtside, feelin' like a boss

[Hook]
I said, palm trees make California
I feel like palm trees make California
I said, palm trees make California
I feel like palm trees make California

[Verse 2]
Nickname James, man, I'm worthy like a Laker
I need a real Cali girl to roll the blunts or the paper
Changin' hand ever month, said she focused on the paper
Met her at the In-N-Out pickin' up a burger
Shorts real short, little booty like, Ah
Bandana in the front, feelin' like pie
W-W-West Side get the money, I make her count
I was born a real nigga, I'm a stay one 'til I die
R.I.P. Paul Walker, hope you racin' in the sky
I poured a little liquor for my homie that died
Said, poured a little liquor for my homie that died
If you got a naked dancer, pour a little (?)

[Hook]
I said, palm trees make California
I feel like palm trees make California
I said, palm trees make California
I feel like palm trees make California

[Bridge 2]
Come out to Cali and I smoke all the green
Come out to Cali and I smoke all the green
Come out to Cali and I smoke all the green
Come out to Cali and I smoke all the green
Come out to Cali and I smoke all the green
Come out to Cali and I smoke all the green

[Pre-Hook]
Palm trees make California
Pa-palm trees make California
Pa-palm trees make California
Pa-palm trees make California
Palm trees make California
P-palm trees make California

[Hook]
I said, palm trees make California
I feel like palm trees make California
I said, palm trees make California
I feel like palm trees make California

[Bridge 3]
Palm trees and blue skies, low-lows and hoes
Fly cars and movie stars chokin' on some smoke
Palm trees and blue skies, low-lows and hoes
Fly cars and movie stars, chokin' on some smoke

[Outro]
Feelin' like a boss, f-feelin' like a boss
Sittin' on the courtside, feelin' like a boss
Feelin' like a boss, f-feelin' like a boss
Sittin' on the courtside, feelin' like a boss
