[Intro]
Shout out to my nigga with that cup of Henny
I see you

[Hook]
If you got problems like I got problems
Then you better pray
'Cause I don't know what tomorrow might bring
But I'm focused on today
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
From A-Town to New York, niggas die, like, every day
Shout out to them eses banging out of L.A
Eazy-E forever, nigga, N.W.A
UGK forever, nigga, Pimp, rest in peace
Life is like a dice game, I hope I never crap out
I tell you what I seen, sixteen with the strap out
Niggas selling dreams, lean, weed at the trap house
Bitches charging fees for the pussy, then she tap out
We out here chasing dreams, nigga, nigga, fuck a handout
And just because I couldn't break bread, I ain't your fam now?
And just because I made a better situation, niggas get to hating
Wait a minute, momma, momma, pray for me
'Cause death could be around the way
Got me in the booth with the clip, by my hip today
Facts only, fuck writing checks, nigga, cash only
Trying to get my niggas straight, living in the moment
James

[Hook]
If you got problems like I got problems
Then you better pray
'Cause I don't know what tomorrow might bring
But I'm focused on today
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Niggas let women run they relationship
Nigga, get your dick back, act like a man again
You wanna eat? Then move your feet, my nigga, you a mannequin
On Henny in that Skywalker, feeling like [?]
These blogs feel like police, the way that they attacking me
The police feel like blogs with these questions that they asking me
No dad, living fast, a black Trinidadian
And if I wasn't rapping, nigga, I'd probably start trafficking
Made it out the trap and I won't promise I won't trap again
No disrespect, momma, your nigga just being real
The realest that I've ever been
You won't believe the things these eyes seen
From moving on the scene and living out my dream
The brokest niggas richer and all the richest niggas scheme
Coming up, being rich was, nigga, just a dream
But now I see for what it is, I just wanna be real
Fuck that
I say, fuck that
I say, fuck that
Nigga, I just wanna be real

[Hook]
If you got problems like I got problems
Then you better pray
'Cause I don't know what tomorrow might bring
But I'm focused on today
Yeah, yeah
