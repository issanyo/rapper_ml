So Profound

[Hook: Fam]
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks [x6]

[Interlude 1: Childish Gambino]
Young nigga in an old whip
Whole clique is in zone six, oh shit
Hold on a second

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Old money flow yeah I did mine bigger
Ape shit flow so King Kong nigga
You got big money, man? how long nigga?
Can't talk right now, I'm in Hong Kong nigga
My Polo rounds, fuck her for only a photo now
Skin is so cinnamon, Cocoa Brown
Wanna be me but they don't know how
So profound
Who cares what they be on, I'm in the sun with aviators
I'm my favorite song, I came to ball
And aim at y'all, you know the semi-automatic with no safety on
Bow down, ladies want a shout-out
Take her, flip her over, lower back I leave that blah-dow
Ass backwards, Kriss Kross
T-Rex, Chris Bosh
Nigga we eating so Rick Ross
Brown rice, fish sauce
Fly as a kite, man I must be
Claiming to be where them thugs be
My niggas is making it dusty
Cause I'm aiming at you like I just sneezed (like I just sneezed)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
