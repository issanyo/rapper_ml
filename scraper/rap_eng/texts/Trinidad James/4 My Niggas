Traveeeey (Hey!)
Everybody who gettin' that money (Wooo)
Trinidad
1 2 3 (Look)

[2 x Hook:]
This for all my niggas gettin' money
Dope boy that keep trap bumpin'
Stripper girls can’t wait till Monday (At Magic)
Everybody that keep it one hundred
For my nigga puttin lean in that sprite
For shawty puttin weed in that blunt
Fuck nigga we ball all night
Every day of the week we stunt

Hey look, all my niggas gettin money
Yeah we keep it one hundred
Some niggas scared of that money
I’m racked up and I’m stuntin'
Yeah I keep my hair nappy as hell
But that don’t mean I ain't gettin' no money
Shawty told me pull my pants up
Why you gotta be so damn country
Don't let nappy look fool ya
Don’t make me call in my jeweler
Don’t make me cop a lil rollie
Don"t make me cop a Franck Muller
Don’t make me make a withdraw
We don't fuck with no law (Fuck em!)
Pussy nigga try to rob me and I’ma go upside a nigga jaw
Don’t let me pull out them racks
Don’t let me walk out with stacks
If I take your girl, if I take your girl
Just know she won’t be back
Them strippers love us bro
Look at all them funds we throw
Look at all them ones on the floor
Look at all them records we sold

I need all my hoes from central station, fuck a boogi bitch
And naw you ain’t in my section nigga, no fuck niggas on my list (Pussy)
I’m in this bitch with my niggas
That's Ali, Strap, and Quez
I’m working on this triple play that molly weed and head
That’s your bitch I hope not, Cause Instagram where I got her
Valley Hill when I’m fucked up, Cause your crib where I drop her off
Here come that walk up shame, real niggas my campaign
So them dope boys, my fam man
And that stripper girl my sister
This song for anybody got somebody locked up in the system
Lyrical my dick nigga, got hoes licking my dick
And I ain’t changin' for shit (No sir)
Say you country niggas getting your conscious off of my dick
I say worry about your bitch
Before she un-conscious off this dick
Damn, pass em to them porters and you might wanna change your bitch (Dueces, James)

[2 x Hook:]

I don't really do too much trippin'
My crib too high in the sky
I don't really do too much walkin'
My car, my bus, I fly
They say I’m in your city, y’all niggas better hide y'all wife
Cause if your bitch is bad I’ma change her life (Okay)
I got a girl in Houston, She always bring me lean
I got a chick from Cali', She always bring me green
Got a bad yellow bitch from Florida
Y'all niggas really couldn't afford her.
And every time we fuck
Shawty let me record her
Okay it's Monday night we at Magic
Two hoes on the pole just trappin'
They gettin' they money they stackin'
Two hoes on the floor just backin'
All my niggas on the east what’s happening
On the floor rolling dice just crappin'
This for all my people working nine to five
Can’t wait to get them taxes

My niggas puttin' lean in their sprite
Try to rob me, dead on sight(Bow Bow!)
I’m drippin wet in ice, I need a bad bitch no ice
She gone suck my bitch, she don’t fuck the clique
Then no, she ain’t my type, that rollie look so nice
Especially when it hits the light
If you gettin' money got a trap bumpin'
All my niggas say dat right
Drive an old school with them pipes
Don’t get caught with that white
I’m counting cash in my glad house
Right next to me dirty sprite
They check with me I can buy, anything I wanna drive
Range Rover, Rari, Maserati, new body
Twenty Hoes in the lobby
I lit em up, they pop mollies
I'm sippin blowin kush'
Stripper girl gone butch
They suckin' dick while I'm on the phone
Just tryin' to make a lil juug
