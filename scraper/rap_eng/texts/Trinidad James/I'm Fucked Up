[Verse 1: Sam Hurd]
I'm fucked up, Whats up
I'm go come through with my crew we got them big bucks
Don't test us boy, We will snatch your bitch
I can tell your a pussy by the way you walk, by the way you talk don't get near me
Four zips in my double cup I'm leaning
I'm rolling on these mollies, posted VIP up a Follies
Buckhead where i reside, My whole team go ride
So fly we glide, Flipped 100 blues at Waffle House eating pie
200 bars a Phipps at Twist eating with my bitch, Yeah i think I'm the shit
No I'm not flexing 50 deep come test us (BUCKHEAD)
No I'm not flexing 50 deep come test us (Bombsquad)

[Verse 1: Trinidad Jame$]
It's TJ bitch with a dollar sign
Sam Hurd hit was about nine
Said he need a feature, Boy I'm on the way
Maneger, my cousin riding through the A
Getting fucked up my forte
No stop sign in my four way
Luck made the beat now I'm on it, Gold Teeth Nigga with the Molly
Eyes rolled back in my eye lid
Fuck with Sam Hurd don't try it, get your ass Duct Taped, Hog Tied
This swag that I'm on right now, Got your bitch on my dick right now
You sick in the face like how, i jizz in her face like ahhh
Now she out of my place like why, Texting my phone like why
Bitch I'm a pimp don't try, Bitch i know you lying
I can see it all in your eyes, check both arms I'm fly
Who's D.A.D. thats I
I'm late for a session right now, So deal with the hook I'm gone BYE
