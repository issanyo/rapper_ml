[Intro]
Light it up
People come from far away, light it up
People come from far away, light it up
I know you from far away, light it up
I know you from very, very far, very, very far
Right away and we don't wanna fly away

[Chorus]
We don't have no worries, no worries
We don't have no worries, no stress
We don't have no worries
We don't have no worries
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air

[Verse 1]
Deliver me from problems, deliver me from strangers
Deliver me from problems, deliver me from strangers
Stress that's on my mind, I'd rather be so high
But I know and you know

[Chorus]
We don't have no worries, no worries
We don't have no worries, no stress
We don't have no worries
We don't have no worries
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air

[Bridge]
Cause I know and you know
Stress that's on my mind, I'd rather be so high

[Chorus]
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
No worries, no stress
Got no worries, no stress
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Put it in the air
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
