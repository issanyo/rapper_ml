[Verse 1: Jesse Boykins III]
What a fox, what a fox, what a fox
Chasing facts, chasing facts, chasing facts
Searching wide, searching far, searching deep
I fell into your hole
Who can say your influence on me
Though the mission, it causes me to [?]
I still have to find, find the tree
The tree made of gold
Oh

[Verse 2: Jesse Boykins III]
What to say, Orion's belt
Was made in three days
And I say
What to say
Its treasures felt
In so many ways, so many ways, so many ways

[Chorus: Melanie Fiona & Jesse Boykins III]
The sun don't shine (2x)
The sun don't shine forever
But the light will stay
The light will stay
The light will stay forever
If you (8x)
If you believe it

[Verse 3: Jesse Boykins III]
Living wild, loving young, sinking slow
Counting calls, counting dreams, no stop at "Go"
We could all be oh so simple
Just lose all control

[Verse 4: Jesse Boykins III]
Some might say
You don't deserve all your own
But they
They don't love their souls
And I say
Love yourself, you're the orange moon

[Refrain: Jesse Boykins III]
Ain't nothing like the rain
Ain't nothing like the rays
Ain't nothing like the days
That we can't feel the pain
Ain't nothing like the shine
Ain't nothing like the stars
Ain't nothing like the rays
Ain't nothing like the rain
We must be the rays
We shine just like the rays
We must be the rays
Ain't nothing like this rain

[Verse 5: Jesse Boykins III]
One and the same, the rain
It's a good day to do anything
When the night comes
I know we'll be the same
Shining, shining bright
Shining like a light
I just can't deny
You just do me right, yeah

[Chorus: Melanie Fiona & Jesse Boykins III, **Jesse Boykins III**]
The sun don't shine (2x) **(Good night, good night, don't say good night)**
The sun don't shine forever
But the light will stay **(Say good day, good days, we do alright)**
The light will stay
The light will stay forever
If you (8x) **(I just want the love, love from above)**
If you believe it **(The rain, yeah)**

[Chorus: Melanie Fiona & Jesse Boykins III, *Melanie Fiona*]
The sun don't shine (2x) *(I shine like you shine)*
The sun don't shine forever
But the light will stay *(I shine like you shine)*
The light will stay
The light will stay forever
If you (8x) *(Ooooh)*
If you believe it

[Outro: Trinidad James]
Hmm
Sometimes I feel like my shady life
My shady life that I live
Everybody sees me even though I hide away from everything that I know is right
And the things that I show you are not as bad as I want them to be
But you're still safe from the bad that you want me to be
And that's not my fault
I embrace it, I love it
As much as I love myself (2x)
As much as you don't know
The confusion of love
Is what brings you closer to what you love: me
