[Intro]
If you the flyest motha (WOO!) in here, make some noise. Haha, cause I'm 6'2", I'm so handsome, and my hair looks wonderful, my clothes are immaculate, and I need a girl with a little bit of this

[Verse 1]
Lookin' for a honey with a heart of gold
Mink peep game, I love fuckin' her soul
Cameras on, girl look alive
Cameras on, girl look alive
Daddy's girl, she mad decent
Brand new whip but you know she leased it
Fake the funk, but it's nice to meet you
Fold her gently, quit the forward features
You puerto-what? She said Puerto Freakin
I'm all about love, baby what's the reason?
I'm all about love but not this season
Say I'm all about love, let's change the meaning

[Hook]
All aboard the pussy train
A choo choo in that thing
I said choo-choo in that thing
Say choo choo in that thing
All aboard the pussy train
I shoot you in that thing
A choo choo in that thing
A cho choo in that thing

[Verse 2]
Could've bought flowers but I brought the dick
Baby face James, no Kendrick
Talk the slick but you know how I be
Say anything to put a smile in your face
Say anything to put a twist in your waist
Say anything to keep you next to me
Still, I don't play that back talk
Vogue it, babe, work that catwalk
Show them, baby, why you that bitch
I said show them, baby, why you that bitch
Birkin bag, Riccardo Tisc
Came up hustlin, now you're rich

[Pre-Hook]
Hope she spends it all on me
And if that's the case, it's alright
I said, I hope she spends it all night
And if that's the case, it's alright
Put her on it like

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm about to play [play] with your mind, girl
I'm about to play [play] with your mind, girl
I'm about to play [play] with your mind, girl
I'm about to play [play] with your mind, girl

[Hook]
