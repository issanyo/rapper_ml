[Pre-Intro]
Ladies, you honestly really think I give a damn if you call me ugly?
Let me tell you what ain't ugly: money
And most of these girls out here, they gonna fuck with some money, what they think they gonna get
So any nigga can get some get some pussy and then most niggas are thirsty for the pussy, but I could give a damn, straight up
You can ask any female who ever messed with me, never thirsty for the pussy
There ain't' no reason to be, it's always there
I'd rather focus on something that can get me some money
Focus on something that can get me right so you can keep that crab ass pussy
Most of these niggas won't tell you the truth, all they wanna do is hit some
If you don't know that by now, what the hell rock you really be hiding under?
That's yo' fault.....

[Intro]
I know I sound crazy
You are not finna talk to me crazy
Naan one of y'all, bitch or nigga
Trust me because I really don't give naan fucks, nigga!

[Hook] (x2)
So I'm crazy? Yes, I am! (x2)
Give a fuck? No, I don't! (x2)

[Bridge] (x2)
They say I'm going crazy, I know I'm going crazy
They say I'm going crazy but I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Rosenberg tried me, almost hit him in the shit
God said "spare him", now we best of friends
On Hot 97, tryna crank the fuck shit
Ain't no god for Charlamagne if he try me again
Ain't no love for fuck niggas that's acting like my friend
Just because I dap you, nigga, that don't mean we friends
Never hold your tongue, my nigga, get it off your chest
Cause, if you hold your tongue, my nigga, you gon' get depressed
And, when the shit get real, yes it will, who you standing with?
And, if you keep them "yes" men around you, they gon' damage you
I just speak the truth, yes, my nigga, can you handle it?
I'm a prophet in the booth, missing tooth, yes, I'm spitting shit
Giving you the clues and the news, check my channel, bitch
They selling you some lies you confuse, can you handle it?
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?
They telling you some lies you confuse, can you handle it?

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I was laying in the bed one time with a female
We just got done doing what we do
I looked at her right in the face and said "I own you"
Straight up, she said "you crazy"
I said "oh, you ain't know?" (x2)
She said she never met a nigga like me
Another Jame$? That's unlikely
Cause, if I say I'm fucking with you, you can hang it up
And, when I call your phone, baby, never hang it up
And, when I'm hanging out, don't ask me where the fuck I'm at
And, if you keep on calling, bitch, I ain't never calling back
I'm leaving out your life, baby, never coming back
Cause stress come with death, I hope she want me back
I hope she want me back, she gon' want me back
I keep telling myself she gon' want me back

[Hook + Bridge]
