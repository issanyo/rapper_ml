[Hook: 31 Gramms]
Fresh out the plane getting picked up curbside in the foreign
On the way to North Hollywood finna to light it up with a foreign
Foreign Whip, or a Foreign Bitch, I don't give a fuck these blue hundreds Look foreign as fuck you flex up and we know it cuh
To the street these niggas foreign
To the trap these niggas foreign
To the hood these niggas foreign
To some money these niggas foreign
To designer these niggas foreign
To some kush these niggas foreign

[Verse 1: 31 Gramms]
Look in the last lord around here
Shit move till I clear nigga
Ride around in the audio
Killing shit like a Nazi
Yeah this whip come from Germany
Hit the break, Hit the button, We'll get up
This AK47 come from Russia
Finna burn these feds like Usher
No way I won't talk to the police
Shit so foreign I can't even say it
Dope game so foreign, I can not be played, cause the rule snot written by you
Now you want my Rolex
No more Kool-Aid
Running on nothing but cookies
[?]
We Got this shit for the low low

We kicking more shit than the dojo
I've never been out the states
But my left foot says Givenchy

When it comes to this fashion shit, I'm a Flexosaurs

Say no, Rick James boots nigga made by Saint Laurent
I could never go broke cause I know I niggas always owe me money
My bitches give me bitches cause I teach a nigga how to get the money (PIMP!)
We always had to jugg just to get a pay we never did it honestly
Like moving fast and thinking cause nigga that's just what it is
I say no excuses nigga, no complaining trying to figure how to get it
Puss- pussy pussy pussy nigga I see you growing whiskers
Get the fuck up out my face if you can't figure out how to get more figures
James!
