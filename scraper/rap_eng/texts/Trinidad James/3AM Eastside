[Verse 1: Young Roc]
Pull up on a nigga right now, right now
Drop everything right now, right now
Bitch, come right now
3AM on the Eastside
Coming all the way from the Westside

[Hook: Young Roc]
Kissing all over me
I'm not in love with you
You breaking all the rules
Trying to hold to it, you can't control
And this all will be over soon
This nothing new to you
Get back, bitch you know I had to hit that
Break it off like a Kit-Kat
Now you want a relapse

Bad bitches don't make love
Bad bitches don't make love
