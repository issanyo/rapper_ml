[Hook 1]
Flashing lights, Caught up in the hype
It's been a party since I landed it's been going on for hours...
I'm living in the moment
And I'm zoning with the baddest bitch that thinks
The world is ours
I gotta say it...
What happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas
What happens in Vegas stays there (here)
What happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas
Let's get lost tonight and never leave here

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
I split the blunt
I split the blunt
Got hoes on my bandwagon
Them new Jordans
That Diamond denim
And of course I got my pants sagging
Been the best ain't no bragging
Known to have the best gags
That Clay Co. finesse man
Your main ho undressing
For me, she told me
I hit the shit so good, that she owe me
Pimp status, that O.G
Yo bitch see me, them legs spreading
Man, yeah dog, it's OV (it's OV)
I'm a cold nigga fucking hot bitches
I'm falling off in that summer
My gucci shades and gold chains
Man, y'all niggas in trouble
My bitch mad with a fat ass
And none 'em niggas can't touch her
You can pay for it, plus tax
I'm cashing out of y'all niggas
Got these hoes after a nigga
Might temple run on these bitches
Might fix a ones on these bitches
Hit the kush I'm gone on you niggas
'Bout these old hoes giving me pensions
And these young hoes giving me mentions
Lost my mind and now I'm in Vegas
And it's, the summer vacation
Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Hook 2]
Flashing lights, geeked up from the hype
It's been a party since I landed, it's been going on for hours...
I'm living in the moment
And I'm zoning with the baddest bitch that thinks
The world is ours
(Are you feeling me)
What happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas
What happens in Vegas (stays here)
What happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas
(Let's Get lost tonight and never leave here)

[Verse 2: Snake]
I'm counting years
And my popping seals
Cause I love to get my lean on
Make it rapping
I'm back to trapping
I'm trying to get my team on
King Kong, my theme strong
Hoes on my ding dong
My trunk waving
My fifth hanging
My top drop, Screens On
Bounce back like ping pong
Cause my weed strong, yes bro
My swishers filled with petro
I stay smoking the best dro
Preflo, I'm about a dollar
Yo bitch bad, mines hotter
Got a bad model, live in Nevada
Cop her head, she quick to swallow
Black and Asian her name China
Tramp-stamp say 'Vegas Finest'
She real hood so she straight game
Real nigga, she hate lames
I'm a dog, (GREAT DANE)
Slot machine I make change
These beats a game
Young Snake's the name
This the summer, we fly as planes
With Nick James
And we breaking mics
Hit the kush and I take a flight
We gone shine like Vegas lights at a Vegas fight on a Vegas night
With Nick James
And we breaking mics
Hit the kush and I take a flight
We gone shine like Vegas lights at a Vegas fight on a Vegas night
