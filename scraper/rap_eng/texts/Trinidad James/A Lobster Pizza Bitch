[Intro]
You know what? Too many bitches around me
You know what? Too many bitches around me
You know what? Too many bitches around me
You know what? You know what?

[Verse 1]
Replace your love with another one
Been through so much, we can grow apart
Fuck me and fight me and leave out the house
And you call me and text me, say you want another one
Can I get this dick up in your life?
Can I get this dick up in your life?
Can I get this dick up in your life?
Can I get this dick up in your life?
Can't get enough and it's evident
Fucking you good and I bust on the sheets
So your man see all the evidence
Yeah, I'm really, really 'bout that life
You ain't really, really 'bout that life
You ain't really, really 'bout that life
You ain't really, really 'bout that life
Stop playing, you fucking my head up
You fucking my head up
You fucking my head up
You ain't really, really 'bout that life
Stop fucking my head up
Fucking my head up
You fucking my head up
You ain't really, really 'bout that life
You fucking my head up
'Cause you know what?
You know what? You know what?
You fucking my head up, you fucking my head up
'Cause you know what?
You know what?
You fucking my head up, you fucking my head up

[Verse 2]
Came in from college, she looking good
New titties, new booty like, "oh my God"
Sex like a scene from a porno
Fucking and fucking in your place on Melrose
The dick in the hand is so good, you can't let go
Please do not try me, girl, that is a no no
But you can never do me like that
You can never do me like that
You can never do me like that
And you can never do me like that
I miss her, I call her, I hang up, I call back
The money, the fame and the cars and the women
You cannot tell me you don't want all of that
You don't want all of that
Lying from nigga to nigga till you find a nigga
That make you stop being no niggas
Real shit, just like that
Real shit, just like that
I seen this before and I know what she doing
Seen this before, she don't know what she doing
Trying to be different, she kissing them girls
Kissing on girls, yeah, kissing on girls
Trying to be different, she kissing them girls
Kissing on girls
Trying to be different
Kissing on girls
She want attention, but that, I won't give her
She want attention, but that, I won't give her

[Outro]
Better grow up, you little bitty bitch
No lobster pizza for you
