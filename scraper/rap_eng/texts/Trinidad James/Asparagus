[Trinidad Jame$]
Let the ganja touch the skyyy

[Chorus: Trinidad Jame$]
I got me a cali-blunt
Now I smoke asparagus
I got me a cali-blunt
Now I smoke asparagus
Used to smoke on broccoli
Now I smoke asparagus
I got me a cali-blunt
Now all we smoke asparagus

[Verse 1: Trinidad Jame$]
Blowin my asparagus, solo
Just got off them papers, feel like Pablo
Smoked it with my daddy, but he don't know
Had to tell my mama that I love smoke

Get high, stay focused
Get high, stay focused
I see the face powders
I see the pill poppers
I see the lean rockin
Asparagus my only option

No I'm not sharing my vegetables nigga, I wanna get high
No I'm not sharing my green my nigga, I wanna get high
No I'm not sharing my edibles nigga, I wanna get high
No I'm not sharing my blunt my nigga, I wanna get high

[Chorus: Trinidad Jame$]
I got me a cali-blunt
Now I smoke asparagus
I got me a cali-blunt
Now I smoke asparagus
Used to smoke on broccoli
Now I smoke asparagus
I got me a cali-blunt
Now all we smoke asparagus

[Verse 2: 31 Gramms]
31 Gramms I'mma fuck em up
Get 'em for the low and I'mma double up
Couldn't look behind me, I had to hustle up
Off of pushin up, I got my muscle up
Now I ran up with my chest out

Ran it out with no help out
I don't need to front I brought the check out, nigga uh
Been chasing out on this shit without no top
Talking about they want to see me flip, but they prayin hard that I flop
Talking about they gonna come back, but they disappear when it drop
I've been going hard on these pussy niggas, now why the fuck would I stop?
[?]
Then I got a plug and he keep me low to the everything
I've been running through shit and spending the profit on 'methazyne
I'm in love with the syrup, I pour out the stuff on the steady man
But I'm trying to be healthy, smoking been fucked up my vision man

[Chorus: Trinidad Jame$]
I got me a cali-blunt
Now I smoke asparagus
I got me a cali-blunt
Now I smoke asparagus
Used to smoke on broccoli
Now I smoke asparagus
I got me a cali-blunt
Now all we smoke asparagus
