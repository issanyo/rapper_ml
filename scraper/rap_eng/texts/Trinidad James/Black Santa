(Honorable C-Note)

[Intro]
(Yeah...)
(Oh, Christmas, oh)
(Oh my Christmas time)
(This ain't Christmas time)
(This ain't Christmas time)

[Verse 1]
Hey
Didn't get shit for Christmas
'Cause my momma, she a Witness
And my daddy, he a Christian
But I'm on that nigga shit list
I don't trust in Santa Claus
Because that ain't my religion
I be buyin' gifts
For my myself and other people children's, bitch
Christmas season, baby
Niggas robbin' and they killin'
Drop a bomb down your chimney
Watch it blow-blow-blow
Black Santa, red bands
I'm on these hoe-hoe-hoes
I got gifts in my trunk
I'm smoking mistletoe

[Hook]
Black Santa, Black Santa
Every hood know me
Black Santa, Black Santa
All my kids love me
Black Santa, Black Santa
You don't need a Christmas tree
Black Santa, Black Santa
Everybody gon' eat

Black Santa, Black Santa
Every hood know me
Black Santa, Black Santa
All my kids love me
Black Santa, Black Santa
You don't need a Christmas tree
Black Santa, Black Santa
Everybody gon' eat

[Verse 2]
Jewish nigga, Hanukkah
Black Santa, Kwanzaa
Black Santa, run it up
Black Santa, save it up
Black Santa, drip it in
Some Kinte clothes
I swear all my jewelry burr
Like it's from North Pole
I ain't climbin' on the roof
Still doin' back door
Single parent household
Getting heat from a stove
Kid sleepin' on the floor
'Cause we so ghetto
Black Santa give you iPhone
But it's still Metro

[Hook]
Black Santa, Black Santa
Every hood know me
Black Santa, Black Santa
All my kids love me
Black Santa, Black Santa
You don't need a Christmas tree
Black Santa, Black Santa
Everybody gon' eat

Black Santa, Black Santa
Every hood know me
Black Santa, Black Santa
All my kids love me
Black Santa, Black Santa
You don't need a Christmas tree
Black Santa, Black Santa
Everybody gon' eat

[Outro]
Black Santa, Black Santa

Black Santa, Black Santa (This ain't Christmastime)
Black Santa, Black Santa (This ain't Christmastime)
Black Santa, Black Santa (This ain't Christmastime)
Black Santa, Black Santa
