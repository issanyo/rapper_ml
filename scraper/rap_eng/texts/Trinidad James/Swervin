[Intro: Trinidad James]
Yeah Yeah
I love the country town man
All of it
The whole south man
From GA to Mississippi
Yeah Yeah

[Hook: Trinidad James]
When I hit Carolina, man, I'm swervin
When I hit Mississippi I'm swervin
When I hit Alabama man I'm swervin
Louisana hit that thang man I'm swervin
Swervin Swervin, in the country town
Atlanta Alabama all the country town

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
One time for camouflage man I never met RIP
Don't beat it every gangster die with it
If you still off in the streets then yes I'm fucking I'm with you
Cause I made it out the streets them crackers still on a nigga
When I make it down the street they screaming that's my nigga
When I'm in Louisiana they screaming that's my nigga
When I'm down in the [?] they screaming that my nigga
Man the south Dallas swagging nigga getting to the money
I jugg the industry and made a quick flip
In the country town, girl can get a quick tip
She said she work at waffle house and the bitch strip
I took her twice the same night I love a country bitch

[Hook: Trinidad James]
When I hit Carolina, man, I'm swervin
When I hit Mississippi I'm swervin
When I hit Alabama man I'm swervin
Louisana hit that thang man I'm swervin
Swervin Swervin, in the country town
Atlanta Alabama all the country town

[Verse 2: 31 Gramms]
Country town legend pull up with the bags
Pac em with the swag but I done pulled out with the cash
Got em, I got rich and cocky, and those man is some crackers
Crip walking in Dallas fly em in from Tallahassee
She knows I jugg cocaine and marijuana
Put it on the road and imma triple up the number
Hell yeah nigga I'm a real dope boy, hell yeah I rep that [?]
That pack through several counters, on the dope roll count up the money
5-10 whips in the yard 2 or 3 of them bitches imma bone
4-5 young nigga with me and none of them niggas going to run
Dope roll did it, I done did it
Put an order in and I'm coming with the midget and a country ticket

[Hook: Trinidad James]
When I hit Carolina, man, I'm swervin
When I hit Mississippi I'm swervin
When I hit Alabama man I'm swervin
Louisana hit that thang man I'm swervin
Swervin Swervin, in the country town
Atlanta Alabama all the country town

[Verse 3: Gold Gang Jiaglo]
Hit the country town tryna run up my bag
Trap sold out like a show by Trinidad
Ink in my body so these hands double up
I've ben throwing bombs you can come in here a look
Esse drop em off now we all the way loaded
I'm bumping in the trap like a beat by Zaytoven
In the country town fucking with the dirt road
Girl Scout kush bring me to your front door
Sac move fast like Sonic Hedgehog
Bad bitch Carolina hit the hole in the wall
I ain't jus popping we be really working
In the country town and you know a nigga swervin (Skrt Skrt)

[Hook: Trinidad James]
When I hit Carolina, man, I'm swervin
When I hit Mississippi I'm swervin
When I hit Alabama man I'm swervin
Louisana hit that thang man I'm swervin
Swervin Swervin, in the country town
Atlanta Alabama all the country town

[Hook Chopped and Screwed]
