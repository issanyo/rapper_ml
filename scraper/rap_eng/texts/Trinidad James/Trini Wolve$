[Intro]
Yeah (yeah)!
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I cadet to my blood
So all that scary shit, done
Ya hear me?
Issa Williams, you see me?
I can't afford to be afraid of nobody, never
I need choppers and lines when I walk through nigga
My presence should shock you nigga
This just the intro, I got you nigga's
Wonder what's next my nigga (You wonder)

[Hook: Samples and (Trinidad James)]
Me ain't fraid, nobody watch me
Me ain't fraid, nobody watch me
(Yeah, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no)
Me ain't fraid, nobody watch me
(no, no, no, no)
Me ain't fraid, nobody watch me
(Shot ah bun)

[Verse 2]
The banana boat for me nigga
Tryin' land private jets
Our pretty girls are on me nigga
Indian and black
Blowin' ganja with the older nigga
Workin' on my wisdom nigga
My thoughts cold my nigga
But my soul still soul

[Hook: Samples and (Trinidad James)]
Me ain't fraid, nobody watch me (watch me)
Me ain't fraid, nobody watch me (watch me)
Me ain't fraid, (watch me) nobody watch me (watch me)
Me ain't fraid, nobody watch me (watch me)

[Verse 3]
Watch me take it to the top
Start, starting from the bottom
RIP all the shanty bosses [Bandy]
On every fucking island
Better hustle or be hustled
Live or be killed
This is for all my Trini Wolves
Holler in Laventille
Nelson!
