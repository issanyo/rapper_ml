X4
I say bitch I ain't dead, I'm just getting started
I don't want no more molly, I need shrooms to party
I need shrooms to party (x2)
I don't wan't no more molly, I need shrooms to party
I say bitch I ain't dead, I'm just getting started
I don't want no more molly, I need shrooms to party

[Verse 1]
Just left the condo, head to the party
Catch me at Atwood, all in the party
Looking for drugs, boy I keep that molly
Looking for [?], boy keep that molly
Tell me who got it, man tell me who got it
You got drugs for sell, I got niggas with money
I got bitches with no agenda, I swear they in college
They got no SAT's, but I swear they got knowledge
I eat a shroom, and go pluto, I need some water to cool off
Bipolar too tall, I might just have to take it all
And if that gas is too strong,  I might just have to take a hit
Let one of these fuck niggas get wrong, I swear we find that nigga's bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bitch we need more drugs, so we get more turnt
[?] no ain't gon' do no good
I swear do ya wanna talking, I swear do ya like creeping
I swear do ya wanna talking, I swear do ya like breathing
Get some home girl, see where she doing it
Get some of all love, see what we doing it
Bitch you get no love, if ya ain't chewing
Bitch you get no love, if ya ain't chewing
Now I'm geeked up and I'm rolling
I need 2 bitches to hold me
I need my own homeboy to hold me up
I don't know where I'm going
I swear yo ho, she gon' roll with us
Bitch where ya think ya going
We at the after party going up, ain't leaving til the morning
