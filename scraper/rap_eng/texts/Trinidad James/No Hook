[Intro: Trinidad James]
Yeah x15

[Hook: Trinidad James]
No hook, no bar
Like them hoes, nigga, no draws
Them cars, nigga, no top
Them fuck niggas just watch
No hook, no bar
Like them hoes, nigga, no draws
Them cars, nigga, no top
Them fuck niggas just watch
No hook, no bar
Like them hoes, nigga, no draws
Them cars, nigga, no top
Them fuck niggas just watch [x5]
I said, Them fuck niggas just watch
Them fuck niggas just watch [x2]
Nigga, what the fuck you looking at

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Bag of gas and a paper tag
She an ugly bitch, she get a paper bag
She a fat bitch, she get a paper plate
I drag bitches to my past ?
Talk trash to my conceited ass
Walk by you like I don't know your ass
Got a fat little ass like Stacey Dash
I still throw her number in the trash
Gucci Mane, Trinidad
And I ain't never been to Trinidad
Business man with a business plan
In the Bentley, man, you can't pimp me, man
I'd a make her mad if I gave a damn
But I don't give a damn cause I'm Gucci Mane
These fuck niggas be watching me
Fuck nigga better watch TV
They envy me cause I'm the MVP
Got 24k on all my chief
I'ma put bread on all my beef
Got to be a real nigga just to cross my street
Can't run up cause I'm too deep
And you can't beat me cause I'm too street
I'ma put 10 on all of my cars
And I'ma put feet on all of my Jeeps

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Trinidad go crazy, Trinidad go crazy
Them bitches loving, niggas judging
Oh lord, on that gay shit
And a bisexual (WHAT), a bisexual (W-W-WHAT)
I can't do no straight bitch, can't do no straight bitch
Y'all niggas see me off 72
Real nigga, you flexing who
Rack for my chain nigga
No carats, all gold
Born again in my ? nigga
I need no niggas and all hoes
So with my dick out, them same bitches all froze
And with my dick out, them same bitches all chose
They sold me up in advance
I feel like I told these real bitches
Real bitches, they ain't playing no radio
Slap the shit out a scary ho
Shell toes, micros
Bitch

[Hook]
