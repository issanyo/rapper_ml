[Intro: Trinidad James & Kelechi]
Don’t nobody owe you shit my nigga, quit bitchin’ (Woo!)
And the only reason niggas ain’t winnin’ cause niggas ain’t listenin'
Everybody reachin' when they know you got the juice (I said everybody reachin')
Everybody reachin' when your pocket full of loot (I said everybody reachin')
Everybody reachin' when they know that you the truth
Everybody reachin', everybody reachin'
Everybody, everybody

[Verse 1: Kelechi]
When you blow up everybody start reachin’, leachin’
Answer to your question ever since I crossed over
Man we talking’ bout practice, what you preachin’?
I went from every ho's D-list to “Please gimme the D” list
In every conversation as of recent
Conversation constipated till they figure i’mma be shit
The brain must have put her on the Dean’s list
Cause you are very unimportant, why you on the VIP list?
(What you really tryna get up outta me?)
The same hands dappin' me look like the ones that doubted me
(And you ain’t help me get to where I’m bout to be)
My nigga last year’s salary is next year’s hourly
(Been cooking’ for a minute, now I’m bout to eat)
And now Kelechi’s eating and you wanna count calories
I’m bound to be the sound to lead us out of every boundary
Out of bounds, I ain’t even ballin’ but you’re foulin’ me
Reachin’ (Woo!)

[Pre-Hook: Trinidad James]
Don’t tell me nothin’
Don’t tell me nothin' (No!)
I know that you frontin’
Know that you frontin’
I know that you reachin’
Know that you reachin’
I know you want somethin’
Know you want somethin’

[Hook: Kelechi] x2
Lemme see y'all hands up I can see you reachin' (I can see you reachin', reachin')
Hands up I can see you reachin' (I can see you reachin', reachin')

[Verse 2: Kelechi]
I said I’m top shelf, put your hands down
Sheesh
I see you reaching’ for a hand out
Malcolm was reachin’ for the piece, Martin reaching’ for the peace
Cops see you reaching’ they gon’ put a man down
Cause they was sleeping’ on the boy, I’m the man now
It’s a new year, ball’s droppin’ with my pants down
Hate turn to love, you’re a oscillating fan now
I’m concentratin’, playin’ possum ain’t the plan now
(Oh lord)
Back back, cause I know you frontin’
Mr 50K don’t owe you nothin’
Mr 50K make the girls do something’
Mr 50K got new cousins
No, I’m ridin’ through Atlanta with my woes right now
You just wishing’ you was close right now
Bitch I’m way up, pay up
Big shoes and you on your tippy toes right now
Boy you reachin'

[Pre-Hook: Trinidad James]
Don’t tell me nothin’
Don’t tell me nothin' (No!)
I know that you frontin’
Know that you frontin’
I know that you reachin’
Know that you reachin’
I know you want somethin’
Know you want somethin’

[Hook: Kelechi] x4
Lemme see y'all hands up I can see you reachin' (I can see you reachin', reachin')
Hands up I can see you reachin' (I can see you reachin', reachin')
