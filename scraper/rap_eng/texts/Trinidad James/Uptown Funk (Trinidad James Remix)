[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
I'm an A Town playa turned Uptown Pimp
This shit is whipped, Eddie Murphy red leather
The pants on Hammer, I'm too legit
Oh, my hair so gorgeous, make 'em girls so sick
Gone wait in line, bitches, even Beyonce want this shit

[Pre-Chorus 1: Trinidad James]
I'm too hot (hot damn)
I like myself on Instagram
I'm too hot (hot damn)
I'm Jeromey Rome with a Gina and Pam
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Covered in gold, you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Thank Def Jam for that money

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Trinidad James]
Got a brand new cape, Hallelujah
Got a brand new cane, Hallelujah
Got a brand new chain, Hallelujah
You betta know T James gon' give it to you
You know Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
You better know T Jame' gon' give it to you
Cuz it's Saturday night and we in the spot
Don't believe me, just watch, James
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Stop
Wait a minute
Fill my cup put some  liquor in it
Take a sip, sign the check
Julio! Get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon’ show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy

[Pre-Chorus 2: Bruno Mars]
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and the fireman
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire man
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Bitch, say my name you know who I am!
I’m too hot (hot damn)
And my band 'bout that money
Break it down

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Girls hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Girls hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Girls hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don’t believe me, just watch (come on)
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
Before we leave
Lemme tell y’all a lil’ something
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you sexy then flaunt it
If you freaky then own it
Don’t brag about it, come show me
Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you sexy then flaunt it
Well it’s Saturday night and we in the spot

[Part-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Don’t believe me, just watch (come on)
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Don’t believe me, just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!

[Outro: Bruno Mars]
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?!)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?!)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?!)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?!)
Uptown Funk you up
