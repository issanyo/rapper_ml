[Verse 1 – Trinidad James]
Still got a real job, still got real problems
Lost all of my hoes, they say that work was the problem
I sat back, thought
Like I just started rhyming
Even though I been grinding, so what’s up with this timing
They say that anything that’s worth it is worth waiting on
And just cause a nigga wait don’t mean he waiting long
So nigga what you waiting for, and what you hating for
You ain’t a real nigga, this ain’t a game homie, so what you playing for
You ain’t got to talk to me, you ain’t gotta like me
But respect me, you gon do
And a nigga on the track with me, he gon respect that nigga too
And naw nigga we ain’t kidding, and naw we ain’t best friends
It’s a real nigga on the same shit that I am, bitch!

[Hook]
Respect is never given nigga, it’s earned
And if you don’t respect a nigga, then burn
Listen to my mistakes, and you might learn
Real niggas never rush, they wait their turn
Real niggas never rush, they wait their turn
I said real niggas never rush, they wait their turn
Respect is never given nigga, it’s earned
And real niggas never rush, they wait their turn

[Verse 2 – Scotty ATL]
Respect is all that I ask, something brown in my glass
We hitting every event, really wasting my gas
I’m looking for [?] street, praying hoping and wishing
That somebody would have a minute to pull up a seat and listen
Was rapping but then I quit, wrapped up in all the shit
Not many rappers get out a few miles of the city limits
And half them niggas be lying, half them niggas not who they be saying they is
That shit will having me hot
I grew up in [?] more, nigga beat it [?]
Instead of that Facebook and I’m tired of twitter whores
I’m kicking the shit with Chain, we were chopping it up
If nigga wasn’t even rapping we would kick it with you boy
I go hard in the paint, no Waka but I’m sold on the
Fact that I’m the truth, other words man I’m cold
And I’m tired of this rap shit, flicks act whack shit
Smile when you see me stab a nigga in the back shit

[Hook]
