Yeah nigga, aham
I just been praying and hoping i got never money studio

Thats what is about man
Taking care of family
Taking care of people that matter
You know what I'm saying

People go home

Till the day they put me in the earth nigga
Yeah

Atlanta, across the water

Ever, ever, ever , ever nigga

Never, ever, never, ever, never, ever, never ever

If i die today
If i die today
If i die today

I never let you niggas stop
I never let these niggas stop

I never let these bitches on me now

Yeah we really be like that, I know
You really be like that, I know

I said you really be like that

Niggas dying in the projects itching every day
Living in the projects you gotta stay down
Just to get it up
Gotta get it up
They ain't showing love
We gon take it from'em
Who gon hold me now
You gon hold me down?
They gon hold you down
They gon hold you back
And thats facts
Nigga get the money, get the fame and get focus
Dont forget where you came from straight like that
Family on the lie cakeplay like that
Take another nigga life you can't pay that back
Niggas ain't gettin suckin chances
Get your life in prison
So while im in livin
Imma make a difference

If i die today
If i die today
If i die today
If i die today

Ayo I just touched down
Feel praised to let loose
Time to relax take a sip to that gray goose
The longer
Pocket full of green gold chains and champoos
Think about the time i did not stay in cup
Should be on grand to the ninety
Couple weeks later see they hoes should tape up
Remember the times
