[Chorus: Trinidad James]
We want to believe you but, you so animated
Tried so hard to shine but, you was still a fake, yeah
You was still a fake, yeah (so so fake)
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
These niggas fake as it get
These niggas three dollar bill
These niggas lie on they dick
These niggas lie on the bitch
These niggas blood suckers
Covered in blood diamonds
Killing they own blood
Over that blood money
Money make a nigga feel better
But money don't make you a real nigga
Money make a nigga switch on you
Money make a nigga kill for you
That dirty money raise ya blood pressure
Blow the whistle make the wolves get ya
The industry out to young niggas, man I'm praying for all my young niggas
I tell my bitches "do they fuck with me? don't be fake with me"
You don't gotta fuck with me nigga just don't be fake with me
Niggas killing each other cause they ain't got no soul
R.I.P. my nigga Nut, thank God that's [?] back home, yeah

[Chorus: Trinidad James & Young Thug]
We want to believe you but, you so animated
Tried so hard to shine but, you was still a fake, yeah
You was still a fake, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Thug]

You animated, you thief
No lie on a chief, just like keef
They stealing my swag and I see
I was in Atlan' like a G
Lil nigga you's a joke, I call you Richard Pryor
I was cooling overseas cause I'm so rich and proud
Don't act like no coward for these bitches house
I come out with like 150 stuffed inside my trousers

[Chorus: Trinidad James & Young Thug]
We want to believe you but, you so animated
Tried so hard to shine but, you was still a fake, yeah
You was still a fake, yeah (so fake)

I swear that all these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
These lil niggas so animated
Ain't no study, just chasing paper
There's no lock boy we never dated
Money long you could escalate it
Keep it real with a nigga like me and I promise you don't gotta struggle baby
And she just gon' say what she do when she see, I call her the nurse baby
Baby stop all that lying
Baby stop all that fake shit
I ain't got me no reason to lie
I grew up in a vacant
She got power like maces
I got water I'm lakin'
But why the fuck you are not naked? (Why you not naked?)

[Verse 4: Trinidad James]
I know my daddy feel my pain
I know [?] feel my pain
I know my brothers and sisters they seeing and feeling my, pain
Ohhh, these niggas won't change
No, they too animated
They too animated
The harder they smile, the harder they hate
I say the harder they smile, the harder they hate

[Chorus: Trinidad James & Young Thug]
We want to believe you but, you so animated
Tried so hard to shine but, you was still a fake, yeah
You was still a fake, yeah (so fake)
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated
I swear that all these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated
All these niggas anime, anime, anime, animated

[Outro: Trinidad James]
