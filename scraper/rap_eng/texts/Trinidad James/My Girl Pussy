[Intro]
This is called sex education, ghetto style
I was doing it when I was a colored boy of 8 or 9 or 10
I had never heard of Sigmund Freud, but hell I was doing it then
I was doing it in my teenage years when I was running the ghetto street
Now, I had never seen me no inkblot test, but it still felt good to me
I was doing it when I arrived in college, searching for my degree
But Lord knows, a degree wasn't all that I got
And that's the way it's supposed to be

[Bridge]
Trynna get hoes like my nigga Bangladesh
Real shit I'm grindin' though, I got a few hoes you know
Like my southside nigga shit, you know something like

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
My girl pussy get, get juiced
Get wet, my nigga she bad like Boosie, swag like Boosy college
Watch her in the day but at night she a pussy poppin'
Clap clap, watch her drop it, drop it
Suck it so good, you had to tell her stop it
She a say no nigga, I'm not stopping
And back to slobbin, slobbin, hold up, hold up

[Bridge 1]
It's pretty good man
When I'm in the store man I got another ho who go yam
She fuck all day if you let her
I went over to the house the other day and she hit me with the come in, it's open
So like I said, "err okay"

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Came in the house, that bitch was naked
Lord, Jesus, come save me
Pussy fat, whoa baby
Whippin' that ass I'm in there, slavery
She know how I like it, tight
Keep that pussy well shaved and nice
Fuck at me, it feels so wrong
But I do it just so right

[Bridge 2]
I'm gonna do it man, I'm gonna do
But last but not least, it's the groupie ho, who I hit one time
Like come on, I tell you from the get go
What the deal was and she messed her number
She was just like I wanna hit, she want me to hit her

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
No shirt, no draws, just gold teeth
Quick a mouth shorty with the hoes, G
Fucking me like they owe me
I don't want yo ho, just a oh freeze
That pussy so good, nigga oh, way she do it
Things that she don't do for you
Fuck nigga yea, she told me

[Bridge 3]
Don't be mad at me, I'm just being me
Good pussy is always a woman
Your girl - good pussy, you should be proud
Trinidad, bad bitch, hah yea

[Bangladesh]
My turn nigga, pass that shit, bang

[Verse 4: Bangladesh]
My girl pussy, my girl pussy
Like the fuck on a plane, that's a fly ass pussy
I never fuck a bitch with some dry ass pussy
I turn into a muscle when she pop that pussy
Cat, dog, barking up the wrong tree
Told her go long then I hit her with the long D
Dinner in Atlanta, breakfast out in Palm Beach
Pussy so good, had to put her in the song, see?

[Bridge 4]
Yea man, I'm trynna get some gold like my nigga Trinidad
It's like a conversation piece for them hoes
It make everything else easy
As if I really need it easy

[Verse 5: Bangladesh]
Knock out the pussy, knock out the pussy
I don't hop shit a nigga, hopscotch on a pussy
Pistol packin nigga, poppin shots on a pussy
She a gold digger, knock the Fort Knox off the pussy
Bitches going dumb, pussy going numb
You know I wore ham like I'm Miss Piggy's son
Daughters, run, bang on the loose
Right track, wrong train, I'm a bang your caboose, bitch

[Bridge 5]
I had this one girl man, I thought she was asleep
But she had one eye open
When I was moving I was finna go
She said "where you going?
You better bring that dick back
I said it's mine

[Verse 6: Bangladesh]
Put your pussy on a pedestal
You does it like a vegetable
Your pussy looking edible, but I don't wanna eat it
I want her to eat it
When I beat it, I repeat it
I want her to eat it til she paraplegic
They salute dick like pledge of allegiance
Got a different bitch for every season
Like my pussy well done, barely seasoned
