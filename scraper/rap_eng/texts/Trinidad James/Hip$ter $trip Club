[Verse 1]
She live by fear
She die by choice
Her skin the color
Of your choice
Fishnets for stockings
Trying to get her stock up
Rubber bands tie her locks up
The music open hearts that lock up

[Hook]
Please don't leave me alone
Cause I don't know where I'd go
Please don't leave me alone
Leave me alone
Please don't leave me alone
Cause I don't know where I'd go

[Verse 2]
Trying to find herself in vanity
Knowing drugs the only sanity
Simultaneously is a tragedy
Twisted fantasies of heartache
Overlaid emotions, heartbreak
Watch her heart race
James

[Outro]
Please, don't go James
Open your soul
Let the music flow
(Go, go, go)
Music flow
(Go, go, go)
The music makes you
(Go, go, go)
Her energy makes you
(Go, go, go)
Find yourself
