[Introduction (T. James talking)]
Aw man. I'm just trying to do right. . . every time! I get this much closer, I get knocked back this much further. Man. Let's see how this one goes this time. . . hey!

[Hook]
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Please, let me go
I don't want to go to jail
And I can't afford my bail
Mr. Officer, please let me go (2X)

[Verse 1]
When you got pulled over for speeding
And you wish, you wish you were dreaming
You wish the cop was cool but the cop was a jerk
Try to clear the smoke but the windows didn't work
Everybody got 1 window that won't work
Trying to act hard like the ticket don't hurt
Ladies show your boob, and fellas don't move
Cause he just might shoot man
He from the old school
Sing it

[Hook + (T. James talking)]
Here we go again

[Verse 2]
(Whoop-whoop) - I'm pulled over
(Whoop-whoop) - I'm pulled over
Cop at my shoulder
Weed in my consul
Started with a convo
Thought I was free
Another cop pulled up life is a beetch
3.5 man you know I had to eat it
They pulled me from my tag and my license was suspended
It's the end of the song I'm on my way to the precinct

[Hook]
