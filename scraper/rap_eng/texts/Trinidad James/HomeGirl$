[Hook]
If you a bad bitch
Show them titties, ass meat
Tell a broke bitch, watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me
Ball, ball, ball, ball
Watch me ball, ball, ball
Wa-watch me, ball, ball, ball
Watch me, ball, ball, ball
Watch me

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
You better watch that bitch
Cause she watching your nigga
You better watch your bitch
Cause she here up on her nigga
I'm not about the issues
I'm just trying to tell
He looking for your bitch
My dick said you just missed her
Nigga my bang, nigga my hoops may be like (?)
I say this song for them bad bitches, they ain't showing no tracks
This song for them white girls who thick nigga, like they black (Nicki)
This song for them ratchet bitches who nigga tatted on they neck

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
She get her own money
She don't need no nigga
Nigga's ain't shit
Hoes ain't either
She only chase her dreams
She don't chase no nigga
She only save her gas
She ain't saving no nigga
She'd rather shop than to watch your kids
Get a lil green, she ain't getting pregnant
Nigga's pay for pussy, nigga pay your bill
You only got dick, nigga how she gon' live?
Get a job

[Hook]
