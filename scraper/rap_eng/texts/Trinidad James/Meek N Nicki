[Intro: Trinidad James]
You will laugh if you know what I heard
You will laugh if you know what I heard
You will laugh if you know what I heard
What I heard (What I heard!) What I heard (What I heard!)

[Hook: Trinidad James]
I heard she a thot bitch, I swear I got a leash for
I heard you a stoner, I swear I got that geek for ya
She look like a Nicki, I swear I got that Meek for her
Everything you want, everything you need
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
Good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
This year ain't pretty, please don't try and play me
I got players from the D I swear and I ain't talking pistols
Talking real gangsters, kill your cousin and her sisters
We only let your momma live cause karma is a bitch
She only fucking now because these grammies on my dick
Her baby daddy lost his job I had to pay his rent
I had to fuck his bitch, I had to pimp his bitch
He couldn't pay me back, I told you karma is a bitch
Hotline Blingin', that bitch want a party
Took her to the southside, got money on [?]
Then I took her to the east side, dropped her off with Scotty
Her cuz got the blow, she had a load of snow (James)

[Hook: Trinidad James]
I heard she a thot bitch, I swear I got a leash for
I heard you a stoner, I swear I got that geek for ya
She look like a Nicki, I swear I got that Meek for her
Everything you want, everything you need
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
Good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em

[Verse 2: Scotty ATL]
Lowkey, I'm the man like a motherfucker
Real hustlers understand like a motherfucker
Startin' to buzz give a damn like a motherfucker
Trinidad, I'm a fan like a motherfucker
I wait with the dreams of a ray
Catchin' bad and bodies stay
Caught a milli in a wraith
I be workin' on something, I'm just trying to win the race
When you come straight out the block, better use a little caine
Whoo, I just counted [?] ooh, Hit my nigga with the six
That what real niggas do
Momma used to cook a spare of a gram
I came up to buy some grams
She suck my life [?]

[Hook: Trinidad James]
I heard she a thot bitch, I swear I got a leash for
I heard you a stoner, I swear I got that geek for ya
She look like a Nicki, I swear I got that Meek for her
Everything you want, everything you need
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
Good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em

[Verse 3: Bankroll Fresh]
She tryin'a get, get-it
She fuckin with the man
Said she want them purps, said she want them Xans
Woke up at the W my dick was in her hand
I had her on the nightstand on a handstand
Racks all on my pocket, bitch you know I got it
I'm dressing extravagant, I gave her that daddy dick
That pussy I savaged it, her nigga he mad at me
I only fuck with boss bitches, bitch you [?] me
(Switch it up!)
100 for that pussy, baby, you wanting to get it
Magic City, she wasn't shaking ass, just the titties
Tricking all the ball players out of all they figures
Meet her at the spot she was fucking up the liquor

[Hook: Trinidad James]
I heard she a thot bitch, I swear I got a leash for
I heard you a stoner, I swear I got that geek for ya
She look like a Nicki, I swear I got that Meek for her
Everything you want, everything you need
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
Good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em, good geek for 'em
