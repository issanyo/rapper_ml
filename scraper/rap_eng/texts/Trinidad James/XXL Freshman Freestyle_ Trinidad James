Ha
I'm an A-Town nigga, but I'm [?] to the bone
[?], I don't drink no Patrone
I ain't seen a nigga like me never
These gold chains got you bitter?
These gold chains got me bitches
Ha, and I still don't fuck with fuck niggas
And I'm still fucking with hood niggas
And I'm still fucking these hipster bitches
If it's your bitch, it ain't your business
And you can hate on me if you want to
But a nigga like me gonna do what I do
James
