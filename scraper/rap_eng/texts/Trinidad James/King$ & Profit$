[Intro: Trinidad James]
Yeah!!
Owww!

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
Blue hundreds in the black Chevy racing from the law
Middle finger out the sunroof I ain't getting caught
Conversations on the pay phone my cell phone hot
Heard the feds made a deal with the cell phone shop
Heard your bitch off the leash cause your bread getting low
Heard the streets want a piece cause she everybody hoe
Gold teeth in my mouth make a pimp speak slow
3 spots 2 coasts got to keep it on the low
3 whips paid cash got to keep it on the low
Fucked my bitch by the stove got to keep her on her toes
There's a chopper by the sink boy I bet that bitch loaded
Not so big young nigga can't fold it
Grabbing on my dick cause I'm feeling kinda horny
Hit your bitch once and she still ain't walking
Bitch in my face that's why she ain't calling
Why she ain't talking
In Clique full of real niggas follow my team
With a no tell policy all by cream
I'm a king young profit just saying the least
Too fly for the fuck shit follow my lead

[Hook: Trinidad James]
I'm a king, profit follow my lead
Too fly for the fuck shit follow my lead
If it's one thing I do, It's do my thing
Too fly for the fuck shit follow my lead

[Verse 2: 31 Gramms]
Look, fresh off a brick 31 Grams soft
Pure cocaine kept bread gram raw
Big boy strap AK47, Bam Bam!
Audemar Flintstones in the bezel
Real scale tales I can tell you a few
Swear this shit holy got to listen for my pew
Everything real ain't fake shit like you
And if I ever disrespect it imma make the fucking news
I can prophesize, Imma make a fucking profit
When the pack touchdown and the mailman drop it [x2]
Look!
Full-time trapper, I am rapping on the low low
Sell your ass a gram and the elbow
And you know I keep the steel with me
Double F&N, I'll knock you out your Fendi

[Hook: Trinidad James]
I'm a king, profit follow my lead
Too fly for the fuck shit follow my lead
If it's one thing I do, It's do my thing
Too fly for the fuck shit follow my lead

[Verse 3: Trae The Truth]
Truth is known to play with green, like he hopping out trees
In the middle of a foreign like I'm back overseas
Sucker niggas got me hot 230 degrees
This one here is for my dogs ducking haters and fleas
Ain't no rhyming that [?] my steadies is something higher
Something flyer than flying in a jet in the sky Carrey Mariah
Pussy nigga with the talking p90 go send 'em fire
Have em clapping like a choir, Dismiss em at my [?]\
I'm a king, not a peasant
You try me ain't nothing pleasant
Yeah I hear the shit you flexing
I kill it when In my presence
Heard them looking for the streets, you can tell look in I'm present
Shit on my wrist is fooly Shictzofrenic
Yeah!, Straight to business so I play with the blacks
You want hundreds don't play with my class
All white drop like in pleasing in [?]
Flow orange color vert like I play with a fox

[Hook: Trinidad James x2]
I'm a king, profit follow my lead
Too fly for the fuck shit follow my lead
If it's one thing I do, It's do my thing
Too fly for the fuck shit follow my lead
