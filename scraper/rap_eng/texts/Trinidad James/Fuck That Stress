[Intro: Trinidad James]
The struggle made me who I am it didn't matter what color my skin
The struggle made me who I am it didn't matter what color my skin

[Hook: Trinidad James](x4)
I've been struggling and struggling and I ain't gon' struggle no more


[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
Struggling I ain't ever gon' die
So I ain't gon' complain no more I'll make a way to survive
The rent due, becoming kind of cliche
Cause we see yo ass flexing nigga all up on the [?]
Rent high as the sky just to brag and tell people
This where I stay my rent ain't paid
No money saved I just don't give a fuck
Fuck that minimum wage man I'm giving up
Every situation hard my nigga you got to believe
All that fake fuck shit y'all niggas caught up with ain't gon't make it That shit from Satan I'm gon' make it
Think I'm playing I love it keep on hating

[Hook](x4)

[Verse 2: Scotty ATL]
Ghetto pasta Ramen noodles to steak and lobster
We wanted lobster we came from nothing
We learned boxing you fight your way to the top
I'm still struggling
Just lost my job, back hustling
Telling myself man you the best out here your time coming
You [?] go call plumbing
Man you the shit stay focused through the bull shit
Twenty twenty vision on my riches [?] on my wish list
Dreaming and working like I'm a mad man
Trying to back a brand new Jag in
Aunt still staying in a two bedroom so I've been asking
Praying for her and my dad [?]

[Hook](x4)

[Bridge: Trinidad James]
I know things gon' get worst before they get any better
I said I know things gon' get worst before they get any better
I know thing gon' get worst before they get any better
I know thing gon' get worst before they get any better
