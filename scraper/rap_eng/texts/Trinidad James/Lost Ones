Loosin (x2)



God only knows
What youve been through
God only knows
What's yours issue

Have you ever lost someone  close to your heart
The moment that you lose em your whole world falls apart
I've been there before
I don't know where to start
The pain be so heavy


When the pain gets so heavy
That its pushing on your heart
Why he ain't take me instead
Hear your voice inside my head

I know you're in a better place yeah yeah yeah (2)

But that don't make it better for me
Yeah yeah yeah




You Left me all alone
To figure life out on my own


God only knows
I swear that  God only knows




Lost ones

What we go through
God only knows
What's the issue is
God only knows
That I miss you
God only knows

For all the people that ever lost someone important to them... this is for you


I never loss till I had to loose you
When you lost you
I think you lost me too
