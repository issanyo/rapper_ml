[Intro]
LeBron back home, throw the bouquet
That's the last thing I cheered for in, like, two days
Sometimes, I wish, wish I never knew fame
Got a deal and lost it, I'm back to doin' me!

[Hook]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm back to doin' me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm back to doin' me now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm back to doin' me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm back to doin' me now

[Verse 1]
I said it's a chance that rapping won't work
And that my first hit could be my last verse
The people that was cheering for me, they won't cheer no mo'
And the niggas that said they love me, they don't care no mo'
I'm barely on, tryna get my niggas straight
Since so much I'm learning, nigga, learning to eliminate
So much burnt bridges, broken trust, tryna renovate
I can't trust these niggas, man, these haters take my energy
I'mma need to pray, yeah, I'mma need to pray like
Lord, please forgive me cause I don't know where I'm goin' now
Lord, please forgive me cause I don't know which road to go down
Lord, please forgive me cause I don't know how I'm feeling now
Don't know what to do, and all I can do is be me
And, when you want that real, you gon' see me
I did it everybody else way, I'm back to doin' me!

[Hook] (x2)

[Bridge 1]
I'm back to doin' me now
I'm back to doin' me
I'm back to me doin' now
I'm back to doin' me

[Verse 2]
I'm back on that givin' no fucks shit
And less of that showing niggas love shit
Cause these niggas ain't got no love for me
These niggas ain't got no love for me
All I give a fuck about, my nigga, is my momma
Once she still smiling, nigga, then that's one less problem
I can't worry bout these niggas, man, who don't believe
They not original, Jame$, they a different breed
Ain't no fair games, nigga, ain't no referees
Goin' through some things and, Lord, I hope that you is there for me
I know I can't complain because it happened, then it's meant to be
Had a chance and want another, yeah, that's just the selfish me

[Bridge 2]
That's just the selfish me
That's just the selfish me
Lord, that's just the selfish me
I said, Lord, that's just the selfish me
That's just the selfish me but
