(NARD and B)

I got problem, I got habits
I ain't like the old me I'm way more savage
Way mo fresh, way mo blessed
Way mo rich, way mo stressed
Way to focus, way to loaded
Way to real, way more important
I got fake shit, fake shit in my life
I got real shit, real shit in my lile
I got shit in my closet don't know the price
I got niggas keep texting that I don't like

Cold heart like bishop, I'm not that nigga
I'm to complex, I'm my own issue
I can't play safe, I live on edge
Girl fuck that rubber, I want that head
I gamble my options, I'm stacking up my deposits
Gucci tiger my body, I know them snakes out here watching
I can't panic I'm poppin' can't play around with the profit
Pocket rocket my pocket if niggas think I'm a puppet

I got so much to prove, I got so much to do
I gotta watch all my moves, I got way more to lose
Way mo fresh, way mo blessed
Way mo rich, way mo stressed
Way to focus, way to loaded
Way to real, way more important
I got fake shit, fake shit in my life
I got real shit, real shit in my file
I got shit in my closet don't know the price
I got niggas keep texting that I don't like

I don't like, they don't try
Opportunist, they don't grind
I'm changing history, I'm changing lives
You scared to win nigga, you scared to fly

Get on my nerves bitch fly
Please don't ask me why
I make eagles soar, I make niggas fly
I feel I'm that raw, Trinidad Dior
Cop that cocaine Porsche
I need more movies and tours

I got so much to prove, I got so much to do
Gotta watch all my moves, I got way more to lose
Way mo fresh, way mo blessed
Way mo rich, way mo stressed
Way to focus, way to loaded
Way to real, way more important
I got fake shit, fake shit in my life
I got real shit, real shit in my file
I got shit in my closet don't know the price
I got niggas keep texting that I don't like
