[Verse 1: 31 Gramms]
Look, I jumped off the porch and got it cracking
In 2008 I wasn't a hustler just a jacker
I swear to fucking god ill take boy don't force me
Leaving empty handed and leave it out the question

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa
This a real nigga go ahead and cut it up
These niggas sensitive please get your pussy checked
Rap Gynecologist, I didn't go to college bitch
Confidence, Compromise, These bitches after me
Run it, Jump it, Swim it, Like a mother fucking athlete
Keep your name anonymous but I know there after me
Niggas dying daily over 2 pints of the actitivis
Street niggas savages, These bitches average
Pass them to my partners, You don't want no problems
One button, One call, You became an offering
Take it out, Drop em off, Your momma gotta call it in
Be careful who you trusting dawg they killing niggas for a wig

[Pre Hook: Trinidad James and (31 Gramms)]

[Verse 3: 31 Gramms]
I just got a call from my Lil Dawg
He told me to hold my hand but he lied behind the wall
Then slapped him with a quarter and another 22
Keep the snakes up out your grass this the type of shit they do
It's the truth (ooh ooh)
These niggas snitching like it coming with a celery
Running from these niggas like the federals is after me
Heard that I was trafficking
Midget by the packaging
Wrap that shit, Unwarp that shit
Break it down and sell that bitch
I done took it all up through the [?]
On my way to [?] and I ran up on a check
Got back to the city got a penthouse in the sky do
No grass around bitch you wanna hate you got to though
You know that ain't no lie hoe
We been kicking this shit
Spot another snake and cut they head off of that bitch
Ridiculous with the fist, you niggas counterfeit
Caught up in your feelings pillow talking like a bitch

[Verse 4: Trinidad James]
These niggas straight pussy, Imma big dawg
She got good pussy, but she a dumb hoe
I can't fuck with ya, I can't trust in ya
And if you ever cross know that Imma come get you
