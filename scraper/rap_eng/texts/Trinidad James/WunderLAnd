[Verse 1 (Chuck Inglish)]:
Big things poppin'
You a little dream stopper
When I need some ice cream
You a whip cream topping
When I need to ice skate
And it's a really hot day
I'mma slide in the lake
I don't even think about it
Heat warmer
Fire breathing flame thrower
Make it rain on her
Watching shorty freeze water
Hot Chili Pepper
In an ice cold dress
In the scorching hot weather
Man, I need to wear a sweater
I should've known better
Than to do that dance with her
Turn a real heat wave
To a muhfuckin' blizzard

[Hook (Trinidad James)]:
COME ON, COME ON
WOO, WOO
COME ON, COME ON
COME ON, COME ON
I looked through the glass and baby what did I see
Alice with an M looking right back at me
She be in LA
She she she be in LA
She be in LA
She she she be in LA
Dancing with the devil never felt this brave
She only wants to make it out in the rain
My heart never felt this way
My heart never felt this way
COME ON, COME ON
WOO, WOO
COME ON, COME ON
COME ON, COME ON

[Verse 2 (Chuck Inglish)]:
I'mma make you shake something
Baby don't break nothing
Do you gotta another one
I don't want to fall when the summer comes
Spring for the win, turn the oven on
Bake whip mix I got something boiling
Serving pound cake with the frosting on it
Everything was made out of love for ya
It's just like candy
Way too sweet to get a cavity
The beach is still sandy
And when the tide come in
She get mad at me hey
Make it rain on her
Like a hurricane's coming
Yeah
She on stage for it, 'cause
She gettin' paid for it

[Hook (Trinidad James)]:
I looked through the glass tell me what did you see
Alice with an M looking right back at me
She be in LA
She she she be in LA
She be in LA
She she she be in LA
Dancing with the devil never felt this brave
She only wants to make it out in the rain
My heart never felt this way
My heart never felt this way
COME ON, COME ON
WOO, WOO
COME ON, COME ON
COME ON, COME ON

[Bridge (Trinidad James)]:
Blue sky, blue world with red people all over it
I love flashing lights but these cameras, I'm over em
The world still loves me but the media demoted me
Music is my life but these women still controlling me
I should never have to pay my taxes
I should get a green card for free
I should be a motherfuckin' President
But I know Alice would never agree

[Hook (Trinidad James)]:
COME ON, COME ON
WOO, WOO
COME ON, COME ON
COME ON, COME ON
