[Hook: Trinidad Jame$]
I be a nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I am nothing like niggas, I do not fuck with these niggas
These niggas be worse than these bitches
And bitches ain't shit, only thing that they good for is they mouth when they talk to my dick
I'm a certified nigga, reputation solid nigga, come check out the stripes
Check out the whip nigga, check out the pipes
My trunk beat the block nigga, check out the fight
Exclusively fly nigga, check out the flights
Haters back up or get checked out your life
Play with me once, fuck it checking them twice
Got your ass burnt, bullets hotter than spice nigga
I got a engine with a horse in it, (beach) house with a Porsche in it
I stunt hard no force in it, both of my wrists say I'm fortunate
Might hit her with the fork, 2 Chainz
Streets say a nigga hot, new flames
84's anaconda, new things
These hoes get laced, shoe strings
Yes I am the truth, this is the year of the truth
Trae on his way to win
I got the juice, you niggas no use with that bullshit
Nigga don't try again

[Hook: Trinidad Jame$]
I be a nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal
