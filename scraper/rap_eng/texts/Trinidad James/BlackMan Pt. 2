[Intro]
They said hip-hop was dead
Shit I saved it, at least helped
Shit look at your closet nigga

[Hook]
I said can I blow some kush up out the roof (x5)
Reflect on my life and speak the real nigga truth
I said can I blow some kush up out the roof
Look up to the sky and tell God I'm the truth
I'm the truth, I'm the truth, I'm the truth nigga (x4)
I said can I blow some kush up out the roof
Reflect on my life and speak the real nigga truth
I said can  I blow some kush up out the roof
Look up to the sky and tell God I'm the truth

[Verse 1]
What you thought? I was just gon' up and quit?
Cause them record labels and media saying I ain't shit
Boy stop, my two videos are popping
Black man with limited options
Who attended no college, livin' in debt to the guiltiest conscious
Supportin' his mama, believin' I can, boy look at Obama
Doin' what I can, supporting the fam, overtimin' the hours

[Refrain]
Who gon' stop me nigga
You can't stop me nigga
Who gon' stop us nigga
You can't stop us nigga

[Verse 2]
We gave these niggas swag money and wisdom
And now it's Nudy, Nudy, Nudy no more Tru Religion
Raury wore these pants, we do not know James please forgive us
We seen what you did, hated on it
Came right back round' and did it
And I ain't even  mad
We sitting back, I swear to God we out here laugh
Twenty-Second floor my nigga that's the pad
House full of kicks like a nigga robbed a Champs
Who gon' stop? You?

[Outro]
Can't stop now baby
We ain't never gon' stop
You can't stop, they gon' tell you got to stop
Fuck them, fuck him, fuck her cause' they can't stop shit
We out here doing what we got to do
Fuck you mean nigga?
Yeah, yeah nigga, you gon' hear this shit nigga
All these niggas was clich√© as fuck till' we showed up
With some real talk in the pimp game nigga strong as pneumonia
You need a pamphlet and navigation system cause' you lost in the sauce bruh
You niggas fortune, on fortune that wack shit you on, I'm off it
Fuck a label, you better get that shit independent
I hope I didn't waste my time man
I hope them young niggas was listening
James, Diplo!
