I used to, couldn't afford shit when I was growin' up
Now I buy whatever 'cause I work for what I want
I used to, couldn't afford shit when I was growin' up
Now I buy whatever 'cause I work for what I want
I work for what I want
I work for what I want
I work for what I want
I work for what I want

If you ain't grindin', then you won't leave
If you ain't grindin', How you gon' live?
If you ain't grindin', Then you shouldn't breath
If you ain't grindin', You won't need no kin
