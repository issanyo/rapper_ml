You just graduated
You need a vacation
Thanks for all your patience
Hands up cause we made it

(Everyone go)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You just graduated
Put yo' hands up 'cause you made it

First dang nigga I made it
First in the fam graduatin'
Put a lot of time in, I almost failed it
I'm talkin' bad, bad grades, you can't save me
Middle finger, every teacher tried to play me
Now I'm on that playlist and they play me
Mama said it was a phase, it didn't phase me
You want a class reunion, now you gotta pay me
I know my whole alma mater probably hate me
I was a class clown, now I flex Grammys
They all pregnant, sh*t, I'm plottin' on a Bentley
And when you picked on b**ch you should have picked me

You just graduated
You need a vacation
Thanks for all your patience
Hands up cause we made it

(1,2,3,4)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You just graduated
Put yo' hands up 'cause you made it (Hands up)

When I walk across the stage, I ain't lookin' back
When I walk through that door, I ain't comin' back
Took my cap and gown off, then I throw my hat
Pat my dog on the back, 'cause he did that
Kiss my crush in the mouth, 'cause it's 'bout time
I hope you all about your money 'cause I'm 'bout mine
I'ma miss homecomin', miss Spring Break
Please don't to be my friend, cause it's too late
You think I'ma let you play me like a dumb ass
I learned how to count a check up in math class
I learned unprotected sex ain't so bad
I had friends that passed out, some didn't pass
Thank God
