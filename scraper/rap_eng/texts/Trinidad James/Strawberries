[Chorus: Trinidad James]
I keep on rollin', smokin', holdin' on to you
I keep on rollin', smokin', holdin' on to you
I keep on rollin', smokin', holdin' on to you
I keep on rollin', smokin', on rollin', smokin' (hey)
I don't give a fuck of what to think about me (no, no)
I don't give a fuck of what to think about me
I keep on rollin', smokin', holdin' on to you
I keep on rollin', smokin', on rollin', smokin'

[Verse 1: Elley Duhé]
Freedom, in the back of the garden, yeah
When we roll, we rollin' through
Eating strawberries is all we ever do
And freedom, freedom
In the back of the garden
Back of the garden, yeah
When we roll, we rollin' through
Eating strawberries is all we ever do, yeah

[Chorus: Trinidad James & Elley Duhé]
I keep on rollin', smokin', holdin' on to you
I keep on rollin', smokin', holdin' on to you
I keep on rollin', smokin', holdin' on to you
I keep on rollin', smokin', on rollin', smokin' (hey)
I don't give a fuck of what to think about me (no, no)
I don't give a fuck of what to think about me
I keep on rollin', smokin', holdin' on to you (ooh)
I keep on rollin', smokin', on rollin', smokin'

[Verse 2: Elley Duhé]
Freedom, straight from my heart
Straight from my heart
And when you roll, roll me one too?
Eating strawberries is all we ever do
And freedom, freedom
In the back of the garden
Back of the garden, yeah
When we roll, we rollin' through
Eating strawberries is all we ever do, yeah

[Bridge: Elley Duhé]
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Kodie Shane]
And talking shit is all she ever do, yeah

I can see the stars when I'm with you, yeah
Maybe 'cause I just took of the roof, yeah, yeah
Talking shit is all she ever do, yeah
[?], yeah, yeah
I can see the stars when I'm with you, yeah
Maybe 'cause I just took of the roof, yeah
Ay, ay, ay, ay

[Outro: Elley Duhé]
I keep on rollin', smokin', rollin', smokin'
Holdin' onto you, yah
I keep on rollin', smokin', rollin', smokin'
Holdin' onto you, yah
