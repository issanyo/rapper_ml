[Intro]
Man you got to have big dreams, big dreams

[Hook – Trinidad Jame$]
You can have it all if you want it (what you want) [x4]
All I ever wanted was it all (what you want) [x4]

[Verse 1 – Trinidad Jame$]
All I ever wanted was it all, house [?] linens, white and all
Black on black Audi, I8
Matching the law
Tell the four fuck out my face
Salute my nigga Thug and Quan
For my nigga making minimum wage
Doing it on his own
She got a baby on the way
And two kids on his own
No place [?] to stay
Make her own, girl [?]
Alejandro
Microphone dreams
Microphone dreams
Microphone dreams

[Hook]

All I ever wanted was a chance
All I really smoke is the gas
I never had dreams of a Jag
Walking out of Niemans with Balenciaga bags
31 shots in his ass, nigga
31 shots in his ass, nigga
31 shots in his ass, nigga
31 shots in his ass, nigga
OK!

31 shots in his ass, all about the cash
All I really wanted was a bag
I’ll put a few real niggas on
And get a little head while I smoke a little gas
Had to get up off my dick
To shine like this you got to grind like a bitch
I’ll tell you right now, nigga on with the shit
Don’t worry bout James, nigga I’ll get your head, all I want is a tip

Flipping and tipping is my type of business
This for my nigga that never had shit
This for my nigga that never sold nicks
This for my nigga that never had bricks
This for my nigga that still pull them licks
Wait till you leave and they run in your shit
Don’t stress my nigga, bounce back from that shit
Cause god is your witness and Christ is your strength

I ain’t really wanted shit but everything the world had to give
And I wanted it right now
Cause everybody I know out here struggling
Forty years old, still out here hustling
No disrespect, I salute OG
Ten neighborhood crips who taught me
How to get it out the mud, don’t show no love
Want to see some real money, got to get you a plug

Obama didn’t wake up thinking he gon be president
So who the fuck are you? My nigga you are irrelevant
Fresh as fuck, kill the scene, leaving no evidence
Legendary stand, a nigga talking [?]
Chuck Taylors on the baby don’t do no thing
Used to pop the molly, baby don’t do no Xan
Ten toes down till I get my chance
The world coming to an end, help where you can

And that’s some real ass shit
A mother [?] queen, that’s a real ass bitch
Want to have it all, got to get out there and get it
But won’t ever see us sitting around here chilling
Don’t think about quitting cause they said that you couldn’t
Or take another rock cause they said that you shouldn’t
Stay ten toes down on your motherfucking ground
Shot ten times up, hard tos ay that you with me

[Bridge][x2]
Get up and get it nigga
Get up and get it nigga
No excuses, no excuses, no

[Hook]
