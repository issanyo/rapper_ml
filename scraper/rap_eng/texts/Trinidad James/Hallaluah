[Hook: Trinidad Jame$]
Woke up in that pussy, I ain't even brush my teeth yet
Gave her ass that Holy Grail, my nigga, halllelujah
Gave her ass that Holy Grail, my nigga, halllelujah
Gave her ass that Holy Grail, my nigga, halllelujah

[Verse 1: Trinidad Jame$]
Baby, get your clothes back on, it's time to get to moving
It's so much that I gotta do and so little time to do it
Put my mama on the books cause I know I could trust her
Don't see my baby sister much, I hope she know that I love her
Got some brothers comin' to get ya, they ain't leavin' no evidence
Better ask about my daddy, boy, that fool was a idiot
I'm cool as propeller bitch, haha, hungry and arrogant
Ain't got no baby mama, don't got no time for that extra shit
Your times is up, bad luck bitch! Your time is up, bad luck bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bad Lucc]
Beefin' wit' Trinidad Jame$
I fuck wit' nothin' but dames
Me lucky, never no lames
Psych ward, nigga go sane, nigga
Call the doctor, lotta blood in here
Not me cryin', got cuz in here
Ten six block to the onion there
Them town, ave niggas be dumb in there
Baby go lookin' for Gs
D-O-G, nothin' but Gs
B-A-D strictly bout cheese
My pockets p-p-p-p-please, nigga
Fresh as fuck and she know the deal
Boosie bitch, she all fuck with field
Windows up, we got douja here
Diamond Lane, we got hoes in here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Problem]
Ain't no one realer, I feel I'm the nigga
You cater like pillar, my captain'll peel ya, my action is iller
I'm actually rappin' bout shit I done did, not shit I done seen
You don't know shit about packin' the thing
Just to be havin' it, just to be havin' it
Only one bullet is in magazine
So, if I pop it, it got to be accurate
Life is a song, check tracklist
Fact that I made it is fuckin' miraculous
All of these bitches, I make 'em do backflips
Fuck a few times and they become backflips, huh?
Yeah, real nigga, that's me!
Run up on me, a real nigga gon' see! Nigga, ah!
