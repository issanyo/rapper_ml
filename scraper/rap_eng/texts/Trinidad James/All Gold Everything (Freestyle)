187

[Hook]
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch
Nigga nigga nigga don't believe me just watch
Don't believe me just watch, nigga nigga nigga
Don't believe me just watch, don't believe me just watch
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-Raww I don't fuck with niggas
My money long, my temper midget
King gold chains, I reinvented this gold shit
You a gold fish nigga
Try me 4 kings like freecell nigga
Sippin' out a cup like a toddler nigga nigga
Who the fuck want drama pain
Back at it like a chiropractor mane
That that nigga rock quarter mil in chains
Gat squirt at you like Stacy Lane
Nigga nigga sunroof your brain
Claim that you drink but you can't even hang
Only came cause a nigga got paid
Sleep with them hoes, they gon' fuck up your name
Pop the zanny I'm stressin', pop the molly I'm flexin'
Dre Beats my beats bang, biker jeans: Balmain
She suck me off till I'm all drained
Kick her out: Liu Kang
Wide body need two lanes, got a 504 bitch go to Tulane
Niggas think that I'm playing I ain't saying this shit to be slaying a nigga
Make your bed, lay in it, fucker
Born sinner, make a nigga die for his dinner
Eyes of a tiger stone killer cold blooded winner
Fucking beast, going HAM, gotta eat
Thanksgiving don't thank me
Cause that ain't beef
Yall' niggas sweet
Money leech, money laundering
Private jet, I don't fly economy

[Bridge]
Man I'll make it rain while you niggas tryna' maintain
All my niggas gang bang, shout out Honey Cocaine
Last Kings, YMCMB bitch
187, stay on some G shit
