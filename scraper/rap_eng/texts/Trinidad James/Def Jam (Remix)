[Intro: Trinidad Jame$]
Ain't shit changed, ain't shit change at all
Still gettin' it fly, still gettin' it done, still gettin' by
Real niggas survive, fuck niggas die, yeah!

[Hook: Trinidad Jame$] (x2)
I'm the young nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal

[Interlude: Young Scooter]
Yeah! Haha, yeah nigga
Real nigga, aye Trinidad
I ain't got no deal but, I got cocaine deals

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Young Scooter, I'm Black Migo Gang
Yeah, I really be whippin' cocaine
You niggas fake, you ain't in my lane
These real diamonds in my chain
I'm a real street nigga and I ain't no flaw
Every day of the week, I break a law
Juug, juug, I juug it off
Count that check up if you a boss
If you a real nigga, I know how you feel
This my money, I ain't got no deal
Black Migo, we got cocaine deals
Young Scooter in the streets for real

[Break: Twista]
See me flow fast, see me flow fast, fast--

[Verse 2: Twista]
Being a real nigga made me a soldier
I was the coldest you ever seen
Out on the 17 like I was Sosa
I am walking, breathing history in the flesh
But don't test me, I'm ferocious
I share the same stage as Pac and Biggie
Rockin' plenty, infinitely the coldest
Changed the flow like I'm bogus and switch it like
I got a deal, and, if a nigga was real
He wouldn't have bothered to hate
Look at the money we make
Comin' up on it, be beautiful if we could do it together
Instead of you mothafuckas actin' fake
Goin' to get a new whip, pick up a bitch in the ride
Tell her how much you be lovin' the way
You be comin' to look at me live
See me flow fast, come in the bitch with a bag
Over the clip and the mask, kickin' it with Trinidad
I tell 'em like

[Hook]
