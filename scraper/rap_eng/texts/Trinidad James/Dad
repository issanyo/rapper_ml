[Intro]
Dad, dad, dad, dad...

[Hook]
I can hurt your feelings, man
Bitch I'm your dad
Futuristic Nikes on
Bitch I'm your dad
Your momma gon' fuck the kid
Bitch I'm your dad
She like how I slap that ass
Bitch who your dad
I come in the party and go straight to the back
So fresh and so clean I look like Andre 3 stacks
She rubbin' on that big boy she say she want some dad
Bitch who your dad
Bitch who your dad

[Verse 1]
Show I.D. before you get in, bitch I ain't playin'
R.I.P to Shawty Lo cause I am the man (Bankhead!)
Imma have to tax a bitch cause I'm Uncle Sam
Imma fuck your couch-a, nigga, call me Rick James
My chain like a lightning bolt, bitch, call me Usain
If that pussy wack, bitch, you can't call me again
Blocked her in my DMs, then I slid in her friend's
I got snipers on my Instagram cause that's a in-trend
So high feel my heart beat I look like Eddie Kane
I do what I want I don't think I'm gonna change
I don't trust a bloat nigga cause we ain't the same
Listen to yo daddy, let me put you on game

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Dad dressed like a cholo, bitches calling me papi
I might fuck your teacher so that you pass your spanish
Fuckin' on a boat you know that dad out here wildin'
Ralph Simmons the sweater, they like how I be stylish
Dad's still out here pimpin, pull up wippin the Caddy
Your sister want the dick, your auntie throwin the panties
I got on ten rings, bitch, no I'm not married
My college bitch 21, I feel like savage
I got my own record label, I can't be managed
20 points a game, whoo, James is not average
20k today, James out here havin'
C-notes for my kids, dad out here splashin'
