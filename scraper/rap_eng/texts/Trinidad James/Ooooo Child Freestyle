[Verse 1]
The diamonds in my Rollie, I know you see them dancing
I plan to buy a bigger one, my next advance check
Faded in Vegas, well, that's one hell of a night
I wear Tom Ford suits to watch the Mayweather fight
Or Designer fronty frames and the dreams of a mansion
That's the dopest cocaine, that's expensive [?]
Don't expect me to love you if you ain't my type
Watermelon Gucci pumps, girl, you love that life

[Hook 1]
I say, hey
Hey, mister
Pass the weed, man (pass the weed, man)
Pass the weed, man (pass the weed, man)
Pass the weed, man (pass the weed, man)

[Verse 2]
Ladies and gentlemen
I got a Tyson ambition with a Mandela smile
All my bitches mad that I ain't called in a while
If a nigga talks shit, then it's coffins and curtains
Bag him up and ship them, that's the customer service
Don't get it faded, my nigga, don't get it twisted
I'm a little violent when I'm faded and twisted
All the money motivate myself and my niggas
And if you got a problem with it, then it's fuck you, my nigga
I'm as large as it comes, I give a fuck who don't like it
Ask his Minnesota Twins how they liking my [?], bitch

[Hook 2]
Hit them with that voodoo, that's that boom boom pow
I had that poom-poom screaming like, "ooh, ooh child"
Had that poom-poom screaming like, "ooh, ooh child"
Had that poom-poom screaming like, "ooh, ooh child"
