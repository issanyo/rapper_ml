[Verse 1: Sean Strange]
Yo

Punish the game, I grabbed the mic and shut your label down
Fuck all the fame, I trash your life then come and take the crown
Sean might dock, I make your whore like cock
Because before me, shorty was a poor dyke twat
Im not the type to like to keep the shit fair when I'm fightin'
If i don't have a weapon then prepare for the bitin'
Im lighting your crib up like a holiday decoration
We sick fucks thank god for my medication
I bomb on your reservation, Osama is in my basement
The problems your probly facing, the obstacles I'm creating
Illogical observation make your dream empty
I'll leave your style cramped like PMD

[Verse 2: PMD]
Aiyo

I destroy tracks with real MC's skills and tacs
PMD, Parish Making Dollars, so get the Prozac
Dom radio rap, cold plays from the shotgun
Lettin' the hands go, airin' it out, the P's hot son
Doing shows on rooftops with Nas and Rakim
P's on this indie hustle who can stop him
Nothing, so what you saying?
This is rap of the titans, still poppin' off, still producin', still writin'
Using the slack…(?)….that's no cypher
Its the grim reaper reaping, time to pay the piper
And if you still into P kid, then spark your lighter
Im on fire, PMD rocking gods attire

[Verse 3: Prevail]
From the stronghold of the BAX WARS, elite service brigade
A formidable performer with abnormal feats of strength
To great lengths, he trained
Hot suns and cold rains
Young age taught how to crack axe through foes brains
Throw spears at long distance, control the chariots reigns
Finally if combatted attitude is hand to hand
Understands the one who wins will still be standin' in the sand
Fills competitors with lead as blood splatters on the fans

[Verse 4: Mad Child]
Okay, Peter Parker, Norrin Radd
Silver Surfer, Spider Man
We can light a room up brighter than a million lighters can
Ain't nobody tighter than this titan I'm a fighter man
Quick, Vitals fans got too excited taking vitamins
Iron man on acid
Tyranny fantastic
Im a ball of fire, I'm for hire if your askin'
Calling me a liar, put that bastard in a trash can
Im a fan of P and never laughing wearing Afghan

[Verse 5: Jus Allah]
Im cutting my appetite
Just till fright night
The blood filled me up with white light
Gotta strike right when the donor is just right
Should of got the name of the owner and blood type
Maybe I should go back and roam the abduct site
Lookin' for a lady with the path to love bite
Gotta use a whole lot of Dove and plus white
Hopefully I don't smell of blood and bloodlight

[Verse 6: Impakt]
This the entourage, a revolution of rhyme
Turn that garbage music off, its pollutin' your mind
Wake up, we some Reel Wolves amongst a bunch of cloned sheep
They wanna bring you down I'm staying up like no sleep
I want it all, fuck getting a portion
I killed the fucking instrumental
Gave the beat an abortion
Im a titan up right here exciting your life when I'm writin'
Ignitin' the mic, I'm fightin' like Tyson strickin' like lightning
Impakt, got the strength and i hold the force
To keep deliverin' the …(?)… with no remorse
Ill take your son, highway to hell yeah I'm trafficking
Somebody let me out my cage, I'm a savage beast

[Verse 7: ODoub]
Don't be a retard
I was killing it when the beat start
Youll see stars, got fans screaming like teens at them parks
Spitting mean bars, every line i come to life
My musics beautiful
You make butter faces with underbites
And you the sucka type, homie time to take off
I break jaws, tackling faggot rappers off skateboards
And fuck you whack dudes
Im bout to puff a fat deuce
Then cover my body full of illuminati tattoos

[Bridge: Sean Strange] x2
Yo get the fuck back, we run rap
(Reach in to the toolbox)
Cause every one whack, we on maps
(Spawned in the Goondox)
Die fighting, flesh cracker to lightning
Knife in the back from the raps of the titans

[Verse 8: Klee Magor]
Swing the battle-axe, unleash my Hit Squad
The cliques hard, like a pack of Reel Wolf savages in the yard
You step on land mines, your man dies
Body blown apart
Napoleon Bonopart, ….(?)
Fighting like David and Goliath
Try and face a messiah
The fire is higher
Never put my faith in …(?)
The mind of a writer, the heart of a lion
Apart of a dyin', divine breed
More to me before I stab your arteries
With raps of the titans
Strengthened with lines that I'm writin'
Hear the blast of the siren
…(?)…trapped with the iron
Im fighting like on my own verse is an Aztec
I blast tech, slash necks
Smash you in the face with a brass knuck

[Verse 9: Virtuoso]
Yo, Yo
Its the spas metropolis
With the sky's black apocalypse
Your fascist politics of oppression make digestion impossible
Need acidophilus
Either that or a lot of clips
You weak faggots soft as shit
Get left in a necropolis
Colossal, the Raps of the Titans
Im faster than lightning
Like a vampire bat I will siphon crimson plasma from your cadaver
Through chrome capture this, brimstone vernacular
Virtuoso master of the microphone masters

[Verse 10: Meth Mouth]
Its the meth eugenic lieutenant
Anti-federal veteran
Since 9/11 I've been hidin' and plottin' my regiment
I can't afford not to be independent
A definite detention for these rappers is evident
I ain't let 'em out, the torcher chamber
I am a force of nature
The foulest to record a banger
Since they put cameras in the court of Bodega
This ain't Shawshank Redemption, but I'm sure to shank you
You ain't sure to wake up, you swaying thought you'd destroy your maker

[Verse 11: Shallow Pockets of Psych Ward]
On that medieval shit
If you walking on needle tips
Shallow Pockets talk illegal, rob your leadership
Up to me to make your heart pump beat skip
Plus this speak will … (?) bleed trip
Cut deeper than a cleaver with a clean tip
Blow a hole through your people like a clean inch
Reel Wolf, my squad team flicks
Snowgoons, Goondox, thats the streets best

[Verse 12: J Nyce of Psych Ward]
J Nyce turn the stage to the colosseum
Yeah, burn a flag for the non-believers
Whats swag, y'all fags, whats the meaning?
Cut bad, y'all mad, y'all screaming
Fuck rap, stop that y'all dreaming
My young bucks got you rug rats fleeting
Reel Wolf, show their teeth and you bleedin'
Psych Ward thats the team of the season

[Verse 13: Jaysaun]
Now I don't know nothing but Karate or Kung Fu
But I've been here before the Art of War without Sun Tzu
So I just let the bullets take flight like a javelin, travellin'
I don't deal with the back and forth babblin' of battlin'
Nah, beefs unravellin'
Blood starts spatterin'
So turn the lights on watch the roaches are scatterin'
Choke …(?)... your poked in the abdomen
Thats pure savagery, grabbin' men, stabbin' them
Apocalypto, rockin' a sling
Or bong hits with a skitzo while your knockin' the king
When they say Jaysaun, ain't nothin you can say to the God
But when you see me, the deity, just pray to the God[Prevail]
