[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Awww shit, my moms gonna be home before the blood dries
It's so much, it could start a fucking mudslide
So many niggas to kill, not enough time
Y'all niggas don't deserve to see the fucking sunshine
Your whole life, isn't even worth blunt rhinds
You'll die first, weak pieces are the frontline
Keep counting my kill, it could be a million
I'm the reason that you check up on yo sleeping children
I'm already high before I even smoke
I try to stay afloat, while you got a whole in your boat
Any choke coming my way, is getting poked
Wet pussy all around me now, I'm getting soaked

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is we, this is who?
This is G-O-D, this is you
This is we, this is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, this is you
This is we, This is G-O-D

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
Yo, I can't spare love, for small ass niggas that I'm above
You owe me your fucking life, you can pay me in blood
Your spirit floats in the sky like arabian rugs
I fiend for seeing you dead, hate is my drug
I allow everything and all things, big and small things
I got all the rings, calling shots, pulling all the strings
You dumb motherfuckers worshipping a fallen king
You're relying on the luck that your cross brings
While I'm trying to abduct one of your offspring
Cause I go through blood like soft drinks
I could give a flying fuck what the law thinks
I'm not a savage that's in love with the hog stink
You wanna go against Allah's breed God speed
When hell freeze and your motherfucking dog reads
Carefull how you talk to gods who can part seas
One thought and your motherfucking heart bleeds

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is who?
This is G-O-D
This is you, this is we
This is who?
Y'all want it to be, whatever y'all want it to be
This is me, This is you
This is we, this is G-O-D

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
All praises due, Allah unshackle me
Now it's like I got two eyes right in back of me
Now it's like 9 lives keep track of me
Nowadays I keep the fine dimes in the sack with me
Nowadays I fuck, but I don't have a hat with me
But I don't be fucking the bitches you be fucking that's nasty
Y'all savages should be displaces like hazardous waste
All you got is black space in the back of your face
I'm from the master race exactly
God of the planet, boss of the factory
Life is a test, Islam is the strategy
The father of reality, mom of the galaxy
All y'all askin' for a taste of immaculate waste, have to wait
The God doesn't practice in haste
Never slacking in pace, Only lacking mistakes
Im taking off the tablecloth without cracking the plates

[Hook: Jus Allah]
This is me, this is you
This is we, this is G-O-D
