[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
We busting right at the priests, fuck a white Jesus
You blinded by the light of deceivers, and peace is
The real truth right in front of you, I am everyone and none of you
I gave my only begotten son to you
Return to earth as a person
Only to see you mouse niggas running from the serpent
Blind and dumb
I'm rhyming till the Devil's rule is done
'Cause the God knows a liar and a fool is one
Raise the holy flag put me near the President's craft
I'll be riding to Iran with his head in a bag
Niggas know it's on till you're dead and done with
Draining the fucking red out the legs you run with
Holding myself down on the black side
Y'all stay on that side, I'm a piece of God magnified
You liquidfied, beside the minds of discerned
The same guys put your forefathers in the fucking furnace
You blind to your own self
I have learned the stealth, no belts, no help
Too sophisticated, tip of my heads are gold plated
I'm born where the souls of man originated
Your shot right in your fucking head with a dart
Blow you apart, niggas know I storm from the start
Keep you off, turn your fingers off, keep your ringers off
Leave your fingers crossed, keep your bullshit and singer lofts

[Verse 2: Bomshot]
You're like a slow snake, motherfucker you're so fake
Say you don't fuck with swine but you brushing your teeth with Colgate
Eating hoes and breaking it down as if I'd notice
Diagnosis and trigernocious and glockocious
My kin and cast my souls from Hell to feel you
I could find three reasons of Bible I should kill you
God gives and forgives, man gets and forgets
Correct your ways and actions or die in your regrets
We running shit overthrowing your government
And torture you with the harshest Islamic punishments
Biting my rhymes, I rip your tongue out your mouth
Wicked palms, stick and stones will break your bones
Drag you on your face through a fiery ball
To remain for eternity to serve a sentence you owed
How evil is that destination for you to rest
As the Angel of Death snatches your last breath
