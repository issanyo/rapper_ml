[Intro: Singapore Kane]
Singapore, Bomshot, Jus Allah, DJ Drama on the track
Yeah; the Evil Dead, Devil'z Rejects

[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
I only rise when it's time for me to fuck or get high
And when my ninth life dies and I'm up in the skies
Me and rhymes match perfect like Devil and lies
He only wish he had purpose on a level of mines
The God Jus Allah hurts like natural birth
Without a dad or a nurse; can't imagine it worse
You're only mad in your verse; this my actual thirst
My simplest words more than you could fathom at first
Go back to your church. Hope your mother-fucking luck works
Dumb fucks like yourself just stuff earth
To me, God takes time: there's a waiting line
I could break your fucking faith like hate-crimes
You're so mere, I wish you'd disappear
The liquefier burns red devils to crystal-clear
I never went to sixth grade: I skipped a year
Once I found I had a way in my brain to shift the gears

[Verse 2: Singapore Kane]
When my dogs hunt you, ain't no place safe you can run to
Monasteries or mosques: none of them'll want you
Your clock is ticking when death hunts you
And when the cannon blow you away, your fam wonder where you gone to
Heaven or Hell? Their eyes swell from remembering
The day you got scalped, like Singapore was a Indian
Save all the talk, cause when guns bark
Niggas get burnt alive like Joan of Arc
You can't stop a soldier who's a known bipolar
Epileptic, dyslexic gun holder
You'll be dead for days till someone smell the odour
Bugs, earth and air decompose ya
And your friends told ya "chill, before it's just a graphic scene"
You got more bitch in you than Maxim magazine
I pass Glocks to Bomshot
And me, him and Jus Allah plot to spill blood like Pol Pot

[Verse 3: Bomshot]
The master builders: we building all five pillars
Raise your sword in the name of the Lord. We snake killers
My rhymes are many signs for mankind to marvel
When I die, I'm in the sky in mansions made of marble
So I'mma set it straight. Why would God hesitate?
When I meditate, it cause the holy shrine to levitate
Even when it rains, my thoughts remain sunny
I pray inside of gardens where rivers flow with honey
Recline onto golden chariots; only angels carry it
My dick swings low: you could call me Sweet Chariot
My pure beams of light that could uphold the skies
Just one of the many blessings from the mighty, the wise
Who gave you eyes, ears, mouth, nose and hands to observe
You ingrate: little thanks you give in return
Come put your life on the line: best believe I could hurt that
You'll rest eternally: go take a mother-fucking dirt-nap

[Outro: Bomshot]
Yeah, now that's what the fuck's up
All you mother-fuckers talking that shit get bust right in your fucking lip
Fucking DJ Drama on the beat, Singapore Kane
The Devil'z Rejects: Bomshot and Jus Allah
Payback's a bitch, you mother-fuckers. Fuck you
