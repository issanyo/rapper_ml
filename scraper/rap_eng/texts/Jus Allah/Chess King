I have sublime comprehension, Divine Intervention
My enzymes studied by the minds at Princeton
To figure my design would divide the Christians
Complete Truth, brothers been deprived of listening
A secret odyssey, ungodly, cursing prophecy
Reading verses that will Preach a Demonolgy
I speak scholarly Lord vain
Require more brain than your physically ordained to contain
I'm on the next plane where everything exists one and the same
Where pleasure is pain and never rains
I seen what you fear, I've passed beyond that
The things that give you tears, I have laughed and yawned at
Your fucking heart tastes so weak and rank
I have to eat dog food just to keep my strength
And my door's wide open for anybody that wants some
But I don't even live inside a house, I haunt one

I'm a prize, FBIs want me alive
They found the car, morgue of flies, I taught them to drive
Fall through knives till every single part of you dies
Couldn't figure my designs if you started at 5
Defend for yourself, you'd be broken in tears
You fool you could probably pull rope through your ears
You sweat cold, grafted original web-toe
My mind in the physical mould would explode
If what I knew spread round the globe
They'd start measuring my head for a crown of gold
Your weak soul is tryna climb a greased pole
In the deepest hole, defeating man at his peakest role
And seek to read my power for its evil use
But I can see the truth, I can teach Greek to Beetlejuice
I'm high as fucking hypodermic needle use
I'll even fucking piss in your mouth, give you legal proof

I'm the Chess King, the difference between boxing and wrestling
Knowing you guessing, only all seeing the present
Being of supreme measuring, unquestioning
You're not anything, I am everything
You second string, to go against a much advanced mind
Your dumb, you wash your hands before you eat swine
Simple cavemen too dense to even talk to us
There ain't an idea in his head I haven't thought of
You thin skulled, a numbskull, my skin's gold
More valuable than yours tenfold
Repute from now is the day of reckoning
The truth shall sound so loud it's deafening
Never will you come overpower my word
My unploughed dirt will grow the last flowers of earth
In the last hours of mirth, I'll be left to laugh at it
Watching how the walls of space collapses on these savages
Evil parishes, disappearing in its own parrells
Proving ignorance is erroneous
I was chosen to write the future as the Lord said
Wouldn't be surprised at waking with an eye in my forehead
