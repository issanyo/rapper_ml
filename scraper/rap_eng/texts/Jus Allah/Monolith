[Intro: Jordan Maxwell]
What we think we understand, where we came from, what we think we're doing...
The more you begin to see we've been lied to by every institution
What makes you think that the religious institution is the only one that's never been touched?

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I am the annihilator, put apocalypse on lines of paper
We can go toe-to-toe and see whose rhyme is greater
I don't think you ever wanna step inside the chamber
I don't think you wanna see inside the eyes of Vader
Couldn't comprehend the force that I bring
I'm like Rocky Marciano when he walk in the ring
I stalk in the ring, you cowards sounding soft when you sing
But I'm as angry as a motherfucker caught in the bing
It's awful to think, but I'm a warrior and standing tall
And I ain't stopping like the Arab & Israeli War
Ya'll some broke motherfuckers, you can barely ball
I'm eating, my fam eating, cousin, we can share it all
Money the root of all evil, I don't care at all
Now me and Jus is back together, we ain't scared at all
We 'bout to do it all over like it's '99
The Puerto-Rock, the Moreno, and the Ital-i-an

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
These are the last days; black plagues, mass graves
Half the slaves, AIDS, cascades, black parades
Backpack-strapped grenades, brazen acts of rage, accolades
May as well have rang the bell at the gates of hell
That's a Dave Chappelle, you must hate yourselves
Chasing your tails, wasting, mate in wells
Read your mail, been tracing your paper trails
Incredible, unforgettable, undetectable, impeccable, the inevitable
Unprofessional, unscheduled, rebel, disheveled, unsettled, un-leveled
You're the friend of a friend, I'm the beginning and end
Model citizen, you just model the trends, you just follow your friends
While my opposite twin, two drops hydrogen, one oxygen

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
When I'm rhyming your jaw drops
Making every one of your thoughts stop
I'm god while ya'll are wrestling over pork chops
Devil had you thinking we was there when that ball dropped
I ain't gonna front; I was strapped with the doors locked
Now I walk around this motherfucker with 4's, ock
Big enough to put a fucking hole in the law, ock
That ain't something that you wanna explore, ock
Unless you want the Army come and kick in your door, ock
Unless you wanna end up bloody and wet
Fuck China's government and what they done to Tibet
We from Philly where the sun doesn't set
Where the motherfuckers rob you with a gun to your neck
Where you shook motherfuckers wouldn't come to the vet
Where your Jordans' getting vicked when you come on the set
Where corrupt cops plant a fucking gun in your vest
Where we retaliate by putting fucking one in they chest
