I was sent to hell, I got to skip the line I got a lot of blood on me but it isn't mine I was fine I stayed quiet and did the time It was a sinch, the punishment didn't fit the crime when I got out, I repeated the same offense I couldn't even explain it I had a lame defense the second I departed I went back and did the same shit that first started that whole chain of events I can thrive with darkness and unpleasantness I have survived the harshest of elements I won't fold when I'm approached with hard evidence, I live by a code like artificial intelligence can't nobody stop me I'd have to do it on my own, I made a clone and killed the original copy It must've backfired, cause I returned after I learned I no longer required a physical body

Yo I was sent to earth this place I call hell guns and empty shells cops with tall tales unbelievable spells in poison water they clip my wings in glory God will slaughter if angels guard the way then I'ma hoarder return to dust repeating to my Father when I'm out the body I don't bother keep my spirit guide close I'ma different author healing my core wounds my shadowly self needed guidance a shared human experience symbolically find wholeness, clarity, freedom through psycho-spiritual means I am my own entity don't even need a body to intervene between the spirit and flesh stand in soils of nothingness insignificance life forms I'm soultistic ballistic chewing through with chopsticks I'm listening to old souls telling tales of higher-selfs Orion belt Bliss, Jus and Steve

Picture a forever rose trapped up in the beasts castle only disclosed after the monsters ransacked thru call me a mini handful Ivan the terrible at age two face unbearable moods like wearing a cerebral bruise that spells I hate you while I'm singing the blues outside of my school while the loan sharks swim in this educational cesspool I guess you could stay a slave to the system til the cows come home imma just slay this wisdom til the powers honed devour thrones so the poverty is left to slowly croak like a drugged out Whitney left to die in a tub alone please father forgive me these hunger pains got me feeling so shitty this rap shit catniss the hunger games just not so pretty only thing gonna kill me is giving up the gift like a wedding registry Oedipus legendary meddle with alchemistry a pedigree unsettling witnessin men who embarrass the whole industry
