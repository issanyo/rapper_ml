[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Return your motherfucking soul before my next blunt gets rolled
I eat you motherfuckers whole before the blood gets cold
Truth be told you talk like you two years old
Same shit you wanna hold like the purest of gold
When my rhyme begins everything that's on your mind ends
Eat slime from the vines like vitamins
Every message from Allah's like medicine
Everyone of them could purify the Devil's sins
Fucking fool, you probably flunked preschool
We ain't equals, I ain't readable
You're one step above your own mother feeding you
Unbelievable, dumb enough to be illegal
You couldn't get this high without a fucking needle
And a fucking supply to fry three people
Motherfuckers deserve their ugly ass heads hung
Only good fucking devils are dead ones

[Hook: Agallah]
I got nothing but hate for you fakes that be all in my face
For your snakes that's invading my space
Nothings ever gonna ease my head except seeing you dead
Can't sleep till you niggas is dead
There's nothing but hate for you fakes that be all in my face
Jealous niggas be wanting my place
And I won't eat until you motherfuckers is dead
Can't sleep till you niggas is dead

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I'm busting right at the priests, fuck your white Jesus
You're blinded by the light of deceivers and disbelievers
The real truth right in front of you
I am everyone and none of you, I gave my only begotten son to you
Return to Earth as a person
Only to see you mouse niggas running from the serpent
Blind and dumb, I'm rhyming till the Devil's rule is done
Allah see's a liar and a fool as one
Raise your holy flag, put me near the President's craft
I'll be riding to Iran with his head in a bag
Niggas know it's on till you dead and done with
Your head's hunted till I'm signing your death warrant
Holding myself down on the black side
Y'all stay on that side, I'm a piece of God magnified
Fucking truth never needs to be advertised
You could learn fucking that one in the afterlife

[Hook: Agallah]

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
The power that I hold in my hand could fold a frying pan
The air and sand do as I command
And if i want the night to last across the sky mass
The clouds won't even allow light to pass
My crew cleave alien loops inside grass
Roll trees and dutch masks, loot some brass
A must have like my dagger and cloak
And red streaks of blood on my white lab coat
A virgin thirst ____ to give her first poke
She crept over to my crib after church broke
Since, we ain't spoke but I hit it dumb ways
The unsaved, some days I don't bathe
Unphased by the light, the scorching flame
Tears form from the ice dripping off your brain
Even if you cry it won't soften the pain
Your heart is dead, you should go and get your coffin framed

[Hook x2: Agallah]
