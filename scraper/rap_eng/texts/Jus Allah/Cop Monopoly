[Intro]
(There's some mystique quality in each of us
A quality that seems to discern truth
Listen to these little poems, which are the
Beginning and end pieces of..)

Jus Allah

(Verse 1)

We're being pulled over, DWB-in'
You're the car's owner, I know you wasn't speedin'
What if they're not policemen
They're already dirty cops for purposely stoppin' us
Without a valid reason
Assess the situation, could be a lifesaver
Survive first, later worry 'bout the litigation
If you comply and they still try to kill you at will
It's like they die givin' your participation
This is a gang, it's part of their initiation
I got a lust for blood too, it's a fixation
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
The greatest form of flattery is imitation
Too many of us are killed without explanation
Never knowin' which date could be your expiration
Fuck the police, what I believe supercedes all
First law of nature is self preservation

[James Allen - As Man Thinketh]
Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes
And Man is Mind, and evermore he takes
The tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills
Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills
He thinks in secret, and it comes to pass
Environment is but his looking-glass

(Verse 2)

Media is staged, the message is scripted
Evil doesn't take a break, no rest for the wicked
They all get away with murder, they're never convicted
The judges get bribed, the cops are tried and acquitted
We're pale in comparison, but we must prevail
They set us up in a system that's deeming us to fail
See what I mean, "sin", "demon", "pale"
Look closer, the devil is in the detail
We were truthful, easy to betray and invade
We wouldn't know it by the news and the way we're portrayed
I'm unafraid to reveal the game being played
I'm following suit, let's call this spade a spade
We want a fair deal, our peace is in disregard
They expect us to clean the house and sleep in the yard
So now I keep a piece, so the next time I see police
I'll use it as my get-out-of-jail-free-card

[James Allen - As Man Thinketh]
Tempest-tossed souls
Wherever ye may be
Under whatsoever conditions ye may live
Know this - in the ocean of life
The isles of Blessedness are smiling
And the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming

Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of thought
In the barque of your soul reclines the commanding Master
He does but sleep
Wake Him

Self-control is strength
Thought is mastery
Calmness is power
Say unto your heart, "Peace, be still!"
