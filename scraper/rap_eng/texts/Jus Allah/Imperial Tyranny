Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that

[Verse 1 - Jus Allah]
I'm disgusted and dissatisfied, I don't need to fucking advertise
I'm a thief, I don't read the fucking classifieds
I like beef, I don't chitchat and fraternize
With police, pastors, or rabbis
I'm one of the bad guys, I never apologise
I don't just walk around with rocks and pocketknives
When it comes to homicide I'm not occupied
Murder's like oxygen to carbon dioxide
I don't know a lot about science and chemistry
My enemies take a lot of time and energy
When I'm not shooting I get iron deficiency
And I don't wanna have the guys look at me differently
I would rather have a gun than an epiphany
Can't really rely on tricks and wizardry
When I get irrational, that'll be practical
Niggas don't believe shit it's serendipity

[Hook - sample and scratches by DJ Kwestion](x4)
Southpaw verbal jabs to the mouth y'all
Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that

[Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz]
Y'all in the presence of divine science
We don't subscribe to y'all theory of non-violence
I rule with an iron fist, I define tyrants
I went down the wrong path, that's despite guidance
Yeah and y'all are soon to bleed
And I'm from the house of wisdom Haroon Rashid
A goon indeed, ras-clat, Junior Reid
Y'all overstayed y'all welcome, y'all refused to leave
Refuse to see that the universe is deathless
I define rhyme with divine mind efforts
It's grind time, I design rhyme methods
It's high time y'all enshrine my records
And I don't know why y'all would fuck with the team
That's like standing on the block with no junk for the fiends
Pazienza is in love with the deen
I would jump in front of bullets, shed fucking blood for my team

Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that

[Verse 3 - King Magnetic]
I know what violence begets, timeless regrets
Silently sweat bullets when you ride for respect
Rivalry met (blam!) with the vibe you'd expect
Four-pounder makes you flounder only live on the net
You know the Internet thuggery, Internet fuck with me
Long enough to see my company sucker-free luckily
Paz heard me then scooped me, spaz earned me this two-piece
Clash surely not rufees smashed girlies is groupies
The last rapper to move me, Ras Kass what he doing
Rap after the blood bath half of the movie
Gats strapped to my blue jeans, back smack to Djibouti
Backpack is with Uzis, Black Sabbath and Kool G
Point made like I'm sharper than a shiv
Stab wound when you think you sharper than you is
Charlotte's Web with the kids, only time we talk to pigs
I ain't talking courage when I say you getting jigged

[Hook - sample and scratches by DJ Kwestion](x4)
Cause you wants no part of that
