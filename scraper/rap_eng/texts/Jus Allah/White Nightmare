[Intro: Jus Allah]
Yeah son, white devil's been living it up for too long
It's about time it's over for that, you know I'm sayin?
I'm their worst fear, the black man, the white nightmare son
Recognize that, ya know? Get all you fiends taken
Get all that taken

[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Yo, I was placed on the planet just to cause problems
Sperm I spawned from burnt holes in condoms
Heaven splits in the presence of excellence
A force to be reckoned with
Way too fucking strong to rely on your prayers and hopes
I walk out the jungle in bear-skinned coats
While you still scared of ghosts we cut throats
I introduce myself, the God is utmost
My brain never touched the soap
Refused to be another fucking slave that stuffed the boats
Off puffs of smoke, I'm fucking phenomenal
What I think is logical, to you is physically impossible
Take a blood drop from you, copy you
Just to get your own identical to tell you I'm unstoppable
Unsurpassable obstacle unsolvable
Math written in my chronicle, astronomical
Pass me the gun for mass extinction
I piss in the fountains of youth you drink from
My stomach got young dead orphans in it
I eat from trash cans at abortion clinics

[Hook]
I'm a fucking nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
A nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high..
A white nightmare
Young black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
A nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck, nigga

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
I'm the sickest beast walking, I read in the dark and spit
As the deepest thoughts of Steve Hawkins
Interpret fucking dolphins
Megallah stab Martians, disturbing the peace inside coffins
Even priests caution defying the science
Violent niggas, who carry the iron giants
No swine diets, the strength of Goliath
Hope your last rhyme is good enough to die with
Against madness, performing the black magic
Savage, I steal from the offering basket
And use it as my loot to buy blunts and sacks with
I give back by sharing with the niggas I rap with
Elite crooks, even the police be shook
My crib got dead cops attached to meat hooks
Dissecting 'em, I burn whatever left of 'em
Yo, my neighbor told me that a demon lived next to him
'Til I threatened him, "Yo cousin, we strapped"
All y'all motherfuckers just cover your cap
I love black, I wish that I was two shades darker
Be unbreakable like Hurricane Carter

[Hook]
I'm America's nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
A nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high..
A white nightmare
Young black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
A nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck nigga

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
You're succumbing to pain, you're so dumb that it numbs your brain at gun-flame, your head should be hung in shame
Lynched and maimed, you're playing with the clinic's insane
Getting bit, up until the last minutes of game
Fuck the glitter and glitz, me and my click, only doin' nigga shit
Makin' hits, only black people benefit
Never put it on the rinse, clever
I never be tricked, God and Devil's blood'll never be mixed
For as long as I live and the lifeline that runnin' my kin
Merging minds with the swines from pig
Never should you test or fake your maker has, your face is slashed
Like a paper bag, pick your favorite mask
Hide your ass like diaper rash
And blow you into fucking cyber-trash
Make you take a fuckin' fire-bath, bitch
Speakin' on cassettes, I can teach your pets
Peakin' death, I could reach you after physical death
Eatin' your beaten flesh entirely
Torturing the soul of you inside of me, I am irony
Like reading the lion diary, the fiery
Only 5 percent of minds admire my entirety

[Outro: Jus Allah]
Yo, Jedi Mind Tricks forever
Megatrom, what the fuckin deal
Vinnie Paz, Enemy of Mankind Stoupe
Yo, what the fuck Cyclone
BA Barap break niggas backs
Fuck Yall. Stupid ass niggas
