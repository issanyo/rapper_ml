[Vinnie Paz]
I am not human flesh
The waist line where the Ruger rests
I take Jesus Christ and rob him of his Jewishness
There's nothing anything or anyone can do to test
I live inside a jungle all I need is fruit that's fresh
Can't nobody find me I define elusiveness
I'm in the darkness in the dungeon where Medusa's kept
I'll aim a shotty at your body shoot it through your chest
And I'll take a second to remind you of your gruesome death
It ain't a question I don't have to prove I'm best
I've been rhymin' since the fuckin prime of Ricky Rubin's best
I wouldn't come against the army that's a losing bet
I'll throw your motherfuckin body off the roof and jet
I'll throw a left hook. It ain't a fuckin' tooth that's left
Your body bloodier and holier than Buddha's breath
I ain't fuckin' around with ya'll I'm like a dude possessed
We rockin' crowds in Philadelphia then Bucharest
It's World War and for me the German Luger's best
I like the way it kick back and what it do to flesh
Ayo! Jus Allah let em know why you the best
This is closure verse it's over cousin you is next

[Jus Allah]
Before you come to bed
Shut the light from his shrunkin' head
Soon enough you'll adjust learnin of the dead
The color red bloodshed
Stuff you dread. cut the thread
What your head would be puffed and tread
I am unkept unread underfed
Unsung uncredited Unsaid Unedited Defective Unaccepted
Don't expect to see the motherfuckin unexpected
May as well pay yourself to wait in hell
The spell: pace your self rearrange yourselves
May you live to say the story made to tell
Make your faith in prayer great enough to break the spell
I'm obsessed with watching death, rotting flesh
I'm refreshed by the process. I relent
Kill the cross-wearers kill their Pallbearers
Being soft on terror makes coffin sharers
Smelt a dead mans odor I ran over
Like a cat at the sound of a can opener
Put you in the land push a pile of sand over
Give your family no closure shows over
