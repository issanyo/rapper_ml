[Verse 1]
I am a murder machine
I'm a person immersed in the scene
I've converted, I don't go to church in between
My murders extreme, I tried to murder the supreme
We'd get a lot more done if we worked as a team
I've researched the scene, I learn a person's routines
I wear a disguise, I tuck in my shirt to my jeans
I'm extra careful, I wait 'til the surface is clean
Held my breath 'til I turned green
Our pistols are in our jackets
Yours is in its original package
In mint condition, mine comes with additional baggage
Murder becomes real simple, it's criminal practice
It's hard evidence, the prints are identical matches
My shot's in your mind state, into mental blackness
Leave you sleepin' on the floor, oriental mattress
Murder, murder, ashes to ashes, my guns leave
Niggas bored to death, that's Zach Galifianakis

[Verse 2]
I love death and crime
Even more than I could express in rhyme
I feel young again, it's like I'm in my second prime
Besides the murders I'm a regular guy, I'm like you
I put my pants on one leg at a time
For the most part I forget who I offend
I feel bad, forgive me Father for I have sinned
I give my enemies plenty of chances to see me bleed
If at first you don't succeed, then try again!
I'm irredeemable, for me to get into Heaven
It'd be easier to pull a camel through a needle
Not much of a challenge, but I prefer using my talents
To try to unequal the balance of good and evil
I'm on a mission for prisoners
Anyone'll do, there's nobody in particular
I'm playin' with fire and runnin' with scissors
But people learn to turn the other cheek
Gotta hate the sin, love the sinner!
