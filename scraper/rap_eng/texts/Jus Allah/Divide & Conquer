[Verse 1: Jus Allah AKA Megatraum]
I am pure darkness, sparkless
Glitterless, imageless
But still infinitely limitless
Pre-Genesis before man
I crawled the land before all you know, even began
I think thoughts untranslated, I'm ungraded
My first rhyme had no words to say it
Force of the immaculate
You only exist cause I imagined it and slit your wrist upon fathoming it
Accurate intellect, the weight of my brain tilts my neck
Obeying the will, I select
My face so dark, that it doesn't reflect
The beast in me only awakes at sunset
My life has no connects of hope in it
The blood I drink, has extra pulp in it
I spit rhymes in the graveyard of my block
I get a rush hearing them beat, the coffin tops
I grow my own trees in the woods I'm from
I need branches to leave niggas hung
I'm running at a higher density
So the gun on my waist, is the only thing holding me from floating into space

[Hook] x4
Dividers, conquerors and rough night stalkers
Monsters, pray amongst the upright walkers

[Verse 2: Jus Allah]
The black man spelled the word:science
The caveman was overwhelmed by it
Made himself deny it
Fed us trick-knowledge and lies
Kept us quiet
You can't hide the power and size, of a giant
Divine my physical eyes work independent in my mind
I read two pages at a time
Don't believe in prayer
I don't even breathe the same air
My heart don't need the same care
I never have trees to share
Cause I know passing weed to me is like fucking feeding the bears
We everlastin'beyond grasping
Mad man unexpressive of emotion, or compassion
Your girl fucked me fully aware in the action the germ I would pass to her had no vaccine
You a 'has-been', can't kill me, I'm guilty
I am what was then, I was what will be
I have clear skin, my soul fades through
It ain't a man brave enough to trade shoe
I wear fur-coats to the zoo
I ain't rich but I keep a bitch's throat roped in blue

[Hook] x4
Dividers, conquerors and rough night stalkers
Monsters, pray amongst the upright walkers

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
My brainwaves shatter faces
Crack wrists, watch faces
Strong enough to switch the direction the clock paces
You hopeless, from a slave to a modern-day Moses
The oldest, my body gets off, the case closes
Release aggression, explode like atomic weapon
I go into deep spells of demonic possession
Gave the devil my rhyme book, just to read through
He hid it in his safe that he swallowed the keys to
Said:'Megatraum' I have nothing to teach you
There's no plague or harm to man more deceitful
Than a lost breed of evil
Fucking monstrous niggas, trade to kill inside their subconscious
Taken what's promised, derived from skies and comets
Accomplish, prophecies of Muhammad
I overpower shit, fuck the hater and the doubter shit
Chop off the top of your skull, drink out of it
Cowardly bitch I hear death in the wind
Notify next of kin, best of friends
Your limbs are lobbed off, by the Megatraum's axe
Forced to wack their own severed arms to catch

[Hook] x4
Dividers, conquerors and rough night stalkers
Monsters, pray amongst the upright walkers

[Outro: Jus Allah AKA Megatraum]
Yo it's Megatraum stupid motherfuckers yo
