[Intro]
(*German sample in the background*)
Yeah, check it out; Snowgoons
You know what I'm sayin', Kamachi
Big Virt, Jus Allah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's the fucking deal?
The Snowgoons (Snowgoons)
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin', Kamachi
Big Virt (Yeah, yeah)
Jus Allah (Yeah, nigga)

[Verse 1: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, at the door of the lord my death gospel sings
It’s what I serve the kings, I’m an angel with dirty wings
From Hell’s church, funeral bells work
Chief, Jus and Virt, we crush the earth
We love to kill like you love the dirt
Code red alert, the guns go berserk
Bring the sensimilla and meet me after work
I’ll write another verse and send another curse
Philly to Boston, Jersey to Germany
Walk the Autobahn with a bomb screaming, “Emergency”
High like the heavens cause that’s where I prefer to be
DJ Illegal, cut, start the surgery
It’s murder in the thirty-third degree
Juju Mob, Kamach you heard you of me

(And we the rawest muhfuckin' click in the felt)
(The real motherfuckers better recognize real)
(The real motherfuckers better recognize real, real, real, real, real)

[Verse 2: Virtuoso]
Bring your whole squad we starve 'em, fuck it, who wants some?
Pawn 'em like the spectre of death we reppin' Boston
Smash y’all motherfuckers, you can’t touch us
The flow fill your ears 'till your skull and brain rupture
Pain slashin' cut you, get the cat of nine tails
Fills the rhyme grill, stab your heart with nine nails
You faggots spittin' fabrications, figments of imagination
You won’t get the picture until I flip and smash your face in
Throw you down a flight of stairs, stab you with a Viking spear
Your whole cipher’s scared cause they know the Titan’s here
The church clothes blood-stainin' 'em when I’m aiming them
Spittin' metal that’ll penetrate your cranium
Tried saving them, but fuck that, now I’m maimin' 'em
Mutilation shootin' for God and making moves for Satan
Next I’m breaking makin' his body abandon his spirit
Started swingin' on you motherfuckers like Manny Ramirez

(The real motherfuckers better recognize real, real, real)

[Verse 3: Jus Allah]
Return your motherfucking soul before my next blunt gets rolled
I eat you motherfuckers whole before the blood gets cold
Truth be told, you talk like a two years old
Same shit you wanna hold like the purest of gold
When my rhyme begins everything that’s on your mind ends
Each line from divine's like vitamins
Every message from Allah is like medicine
Every one of them could purify the Devil’s sins
Fuckin' fool, you probably flunked pre-school
We ain’t equals, I ain’t readable
You’re one step above your own mother feeding you
Unbelievable, dumb enough to be illegal
You couldn’t get this high without a fucking needle
And a fuckin' supply to fry three people

[Outro]
(Like M.O.P., nigga, I'll mash you out)
(And we the rawest muhfuckin' click in the felt)
(The real motherfuckers better recognize real)
(You're fuckin' with the wrong clan and the wrong man)
(Real motherfuckers better recognize real, real, real, real)
(Real motherfuckers better recognize real, real, real, real, real)
