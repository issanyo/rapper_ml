[Verse 1]
Peep my credentials involving instrumentals
Rhymes massage the cells in your mental
Relieves you of the babblin' that you was used to
Ever since the departing days of the Juice Crew
My style been milk like a bottle of YooHoo
Was never MC monkey see monkey do
I move through baby all natural
Pose for Illadelph when I gets lyrical
Ou-ou like Cool Cee used to do
I make the kids wanna Ra like Afu
Shouts to Mecca 'cause the Planets mad digable
Allow me to pause and hit the mark, nanu-nanu
Wordplay

[Verse 2]
My aura is psychedelic, flow non-prehistoric
Metamorphic, boric like acid, no hat tricks, a classic
So park that ass like Jurassic
And check the matrix
Completion like seven to overshadow the triple six
Complimenting zig-a-zigs
With wisdom like Five Percenters when doing mathematics
Flips scripts like acrobatics
Intrinsic in rapping like insulin to diabetics
Text is didactic with nutrients like Mueslix
On wax flex facts like hydraulics when vexed
To catch flicks by Miramax or Kodak
I looks beyond the door like 100x
The wordplay

[Verse 3]
Break out analogies like pollen do allergies
Got the vocab like the Fugees to collect Gs
Top Bill like Bellamy
Shocking hardcore heads like electricity
Cuts come complimentary of disc jockey Sean-Ski
Yo vocally Bahama-D be easy like Mo Bee
Raps react radio act like DJ Ran and Colby
To the Roots like Malik B
Flows pose as noise reduction on MCs like Dolby
Down by law like felonies
Catchy like T-B Essential to the elements like Ceceley
