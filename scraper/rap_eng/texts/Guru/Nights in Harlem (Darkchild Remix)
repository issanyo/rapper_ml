[Rap: Guru]
In the Big Apple, scars embedded like tattoos
Ghetto love protects you from what's coming at you
Keeping our heads up, maintaining self-esteem
And reminiscing on the Harlem night scene
We used to party all night
We used to hang out all night like it was alright
Hoping we all might make it through
Doing what it takes to do to keep it true

[Verse 1]
I like to reminisce about the night we kissed
It was somewhere in Harlem
The nights were hot and bright
You could treat your honey right
'Cause Sylvia's would burn all night

[Chorus]
Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
Remember the nights in Harlem

[Verse 2]
Big sister had a group
And they'd sit out on the stoop
And Lordy could they harmonize
My cousin Joe could blow
Just like the radio
And he used to drive them "B" girls wild

[Chorus]
Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
Remember the nights in Harlem

[Rap: Guru]
Ayo, the blocks are hot, Uptown, you know the spots
Nightlife, where this player's game is quite tight
1-2-5 where my name's inscribed
Sparkin' trees, avoiding felonies, keeping it live
Headed for the riches, straight to stardom
Can't forget the struggle, though, Brook-nam to Harlem
Dapper Dan's, shows at the Apollo
Harlem days, summertime, it's my rhyme you'll follow
And through the pain, we held on
With more to obtain, more to gain, and can't dwell on
Bad vibes and sad lives we encountered
Take care of self and family, that's what it amounts to
Inhale, so you can feel this realness
New York sound, down with more cats than Felix
Steal this, yeah, some, they may wanna
You can't duplicate the great, I make it warmer
Just like the Harlem streets we all know
We're coming up, it's time we all blow
We all grow, each one's gotta shine
A better life, that's what each one's gotta find

[Chorus]
Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the nights in Harlem
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
Remember the nights in Harlem

Remember the times we struggled and still held on
Remember the times when we would dance all night long
