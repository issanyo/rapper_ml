So when you think you know the whole
You don't even know the half

Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
What I'm going through
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
What I feel inside
(Nobody knows about the dreams, 'bout the dreams)

Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
What I'm going through
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
What I feel inside
(Nobody knows about the dreams, 'bout the dreams)

I'm catching a flashback of the days when
My pockets were dry, I only had a few friends
Those same brothers now my family
We've been through it all, in this industry

Mad frustrated, ready to flip because
The company was playing me like some dumb kid
Video out and I'm still riding the train
Working and hustling, no pain no gain

Now here comes the spotlight, still something's not right
I gotta pay my rent by five o'clock tonight
Living on fifty cent noodles but I'm playing the game
That the brothers know I'm true to

Can't let up, although the journey is rough
Focus on the goal like it's the Stanley Cup
I gotta play this thing for keeps
My only stress relief is the hip-hop beats

Nobody knows
(Nobody knows, the insides and out y'all)
When I close the door
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
They try to kill my dreams
(Nobody knows about the dreams, 'bout the dreams)

Skipping the turn styles, everyday lifestyle
Looking at this world with mad anger 'cause it's wild
People thinking that I'm blowing up
But they don't understand, the young man is growing up

Now who you think I should trust?
Better rely on self, no time for missing the bus
Fake people, phony characters
They begin to swarm, so I built up barriers

To block 'em out but they still dwelling
Makes me wanna just start yelling
But I play it cool though 'cause I'm no fool, yo
See chumps'll always try to break down your flow

Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
What I'm going through
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
What I feel inside
(Nobody knows about the dreams, 'bout the dreams)

No time for misery, no time for empty wishing
'Fridgerator's bare, killing roaches in the kitchen
Just spent my last on a 40 to sip away my troubles
Now it's worse 'cause I'm hungry

I check my man for advice
He lent me 20 dollars and we lounged and got nice
I told him nobody knows about the wack side
I feel like a slave getting whipped on my backside

Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
When I close the door
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
They try to kill my dreams
(Nobody knows about the dreams 'bout the dreams)

Nobody knows
(Nobody knows the insides and out y'all)
What I'm going through
(Nobody knows what's behind the scenes)
Nobody knows
(Nobody knows about the hardship and sorrow)
What I feel inside
(Nobody knows about the dreams 'bout the dreams)
