Maintain our focus and elevate
Maintain our focus and elevate

[Rap: Guru]
The king of sorrow
The bearer of all pain
And your tomorrow it'll all be the same

[Verse 1]
I'm crying everyone's tears
And they're inside our private war
I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I supposed to do?
I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothing would change, nothing would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothing's any good

[Chorus:]
The D.J's playing the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
I wonder if this grief will ever let me go
I feel like I am the King of Sorrow
The King of Sorrow

[Rap: Guru]
The king of sorrow
The bearer of all pain
The king of sorrow
The bearer of all pain

[Verse 2:]
I suppose I could just walk away
Will I disappoint my future if I stay?
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothing's any good

[Chorus:]
The D.J's playing the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
I wonder will this grief ever be gone
Will it ever go?
I'm the King of Sorrow
The King of Sorrow

[Rap: Guru]
The king of sorrow
The bearer of all pain
The king of sorrow
The bearer of all pain

[Verse 3]
I'm crying everyone's tears
I have already paid for all my future sins
There's nothing anyone can say to take this away
It's just another day and nothing's any good
The king of sorrow

[Rap: Guru]
The king of sorrow
The bearer of all pain
For today and for tomorrow
The one that follow with no shame
So named because she lives with humble passions
Doesn't love the fame
Forever grief, no satisfaction
More than a fraction of the agony
She'll always be the master of the tragedy
She'd gladly be in the midst of catastrophe
I know she has to be trying to free herself from this
Maybe love is pride, maybe she's doomed to unselfishness

[Outro]
The King of Sorrow
(Maintain our focus and elevate)
King of Sorrow
(The king of sorrow
The bearer of all pain)
King of Sorrow
(The king of sorrow
The bearer of all pain)
King of Sorrow
Sorrow
