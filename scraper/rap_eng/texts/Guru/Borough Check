(Ladybug)

Acted when I fee it

Four for the rhyme
Do that crooklyn shit style all the time

(Guru)
Yeah yeah, what
Who want it yeah yeah kid

(Butterfly)
One, two uh

(All)
Brooklyn, Brooklyn, big borough with teeth
But everything in Brooklyn ain't always what it seems
You might get hurt if you come from out of town
But down by lord that's word

(Butterfly)
Fantastic

(Ladybug)
Show stoppin emcees

(Guru)
Yeah here streets is move by Glocks in whos pocket

(Ladybug)
But if you're down come around check the super rhyme

(Butterfly)
We don't drop dimes

(Ladybug)
Come and have a funky time

(Butterfly)
Well it's the 718 and everything is straight

...

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Butterfly)
With the type street curb hangers and the beat don't
Shtop

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Doodlebug)
It's no lie, do or die in the land of show and prove

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Ladybug)
Well Keith, Cee-Know, my fist and Butter's 'fro

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Guru)
The fly clothes, cash flow, and crazy L's to spark

(Ladybug)
It's crowded plus they jerkin my space
Shouted cause they chase when I strut out
Sift through my block I'm c-cool
She's my mood to brace
Stole my mind back black
So what you play the boards
Skimmer we got butter so surfaces out
Clever, and I fix it for you, funk time is monk time
Slackers hit the bat, blackest fit my pack
And we for whatever
We get down in this pleasure heavy
And we are measured by the tens degrees of math
In a puzzle hand locked, clocked in struggle
Can't keep the three foot three above mec
In so depth I defect

(Ladybug & Doodlebug)
With my vanguard squad the gods in brooklyn

(Doodlebug)
And we troopin throught the Fulton forkways
The eastern parkways
I'm broader than broadway, nothing more than morays
I sways, why cause I'm a Brooklyn stroller
No ones cooler, pigs on my boulder
So I switch my pitch as I stretch down Atlantic
Strictly slickly with my fork mean tactic
In fact it's really on the daily
Kids with guns and herbs look for herbs
Now I think you feel me
I freaks it, cause yo like my pimp stroll is cool
When I creeps up the sweet and jeeps blast
Tools rule the area, yo these fool don't play
I got the comrades of love, so the g stays
Brooklyn side with the crooklyn slide

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Ladybug)
Out on Fulton ave. where the honeys be at

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Guru)
Type slick, keep it movin when it's after dark

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Butterfly)
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

(Doodlebug)
No lies, do or die in the land of show and prove

(Guru)
The place where I dwell is where the warriors dwell
Too many stories to tell
So on the block we don't talk
Stack of loot takin propers
Might get a serious offer from a corrupt ass copper
So um, stop the nonsense
Brooklyn is the illest, the realest
Observe these words as I reveal this
Man my peoples out here they get down for this
Each one's a one man gang with a crown for this
Mad burners to handle any business
And mad sneaky ways so ain't leavin any witness
Got way more drama the theatrical lessons
So my suggestion, you come correct no question
Cause if you comin with that funny hot dog style
You might get looted, executed black mob style
From east New York back to Fort Green
Brooklyns' classic mystical magic scene

(Butterfly)
We are plush like a million bucks
Down every ave for like a zillion blocks
Blowin out
With my nappy hoods down Fulton
Bless and guess style limpin past the Walt Whitman
Steelo's changed on the corners we hang
The crime stoppers get mad with poppers and tens
And my scrambles ample kid, no part timin, just rhymin
In other words, I play these curbs, with j u ice
When they say you nice, I say son a little somethin
Brooklyn's asphalt rolls like a syl keith rodeo
We bump the big sound, down and gritty
Record and mic checkin, no question, this section of
New York City
Where the crooks lounge out, Black Power is found
Butterfly ground the sky favorite package of pound
It's like th-that, the beats know we be strappin em out
Mad moneys wish they g like us, clout
When I'm in the boogie I'm imported, I study chairman Mao
Ain't nothin but Crooklyn in my plasma now
I got my g's behind the tongue of my gold high classics
I'm all city when I'm dipped, if you want us you can find us (aw shit)

(All)
We live in brooklyn

(Doodlebug)
Coney island's buck whiling and we b-boy stylin

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Butterfly)
Yeah, on the spot we hustle cause like th-that

(Guru)
Mad game, takin wins, the shit is real son

(All)
We live in Brooklyn

(Ladybug)
With my girls and marissa now you're up in Cambridge

(Butterfly & Ladybug)
Fly shit
And every spot we hit is gettin blown
That's just how we do it baby
Out here in Brooklyn baby
Slick move
Cause can't nothin stop up but us
So we gettin ours baby
Nothin but Brooklyn baby

(Butterfly)
Ft. Green, The Sty, Queensburg, Coney I
