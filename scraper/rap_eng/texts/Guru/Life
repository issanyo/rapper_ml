[Verse 1: Gus Da Vigilante]
Through different days, same shit
Everybody thinking of a quick scheme to get rich
Life a struggle, shoulda hustled
Or just do a stick and spend time for credit cards pumpin'
What - a drug posession charge don't make cars attack
Still it's five down, goin' out of town with a pound of weed
And tryna get back on the street, suicidal mind just weep
Tryna reach his kid, standin' on the edge of a porch
You got nothin' to live for, another kid turn to alcohol
Just tryna solve a problem, it's common
Up to this day, everybody tryna get paid and get laid
Pack protection, or catch AIDS
So get shot, murder, what's the rap
Crooked cops, and cajuns selling like crack
Killin' blacks, but I ain't tryna hear that
Everything all in 360, so we 'bout to take it back

[Verse 2: Guru]
Ayo, tha ill shit's depicted, when we kick shit, realistic
Today I got mad problems for bein' a black man
I'm not that man that wants to get dissed by the taxman
So I'ma say what I really need, I'm cravin' more green
I'm talkin' returns they owe me
Unless you really know me, don't act like you know me
See, white kids are sayin' ,nigga and they violatin'
I got more black panthers than the movie that they made
I'm down with Premo, Shug, Jeru and the Group Home
M.O.P., Stikken Moov and niggas'll never leave my back alone
And so you know, these type of brothers multiply
That's why we must live fly and fakin' jax die
I gets mine, I gets mine, too grown for dumb shit
Caught up in the street life, so I keep at least one clip
To deal with strife, and that's life

[Hook:]
Keep ya eyes on people, because they scopin
Don't be gettin' caught sleepin' in these streets, put ya eyes wide open
There's no right to live life, ghetto kids is trife
Do ya dirt, pack ya Gat, watch yo back, that's life

[Verse 3: Gus Da Vigilante]
Taking that liquor 'til my eyes glaze, drowning my brain
Mind on capital gain, wise eye on my game plan
Movin' the grand steadily, enough to build PJ's in Beverly
Kick rhymes in my art proceeds
When I release Queens style, baggy guess profile
Cars get 19 gallons to the mile
Livin' in luxuries, like everything fancy
Chicken headz be trickin' on me, the streets treat me lovely
Focasing all the lies in the sheisty's eyes
Use their weakness to their demise, cause they small in size
And I see the big picture, I put ya six feet for six figures - Aight?
Puttin' it on the opposition so my Nine stays tight
The street life under them street lights is right

[Verse 4: Lil' Fame]
So everything will be aight
I know some shit that happened recent, it was two kids beefing
Heard one was snitchin' in the precinct, hit the Deps up decent
Put him to rest, got it up off his chest, ain't got rid of the stress
When his mama put one right through his flesh
Who said life is equal? Kid, there's no sequel
When I messes, I pray to God ,put me with my people"
(To the death!)
M.O.P niggas sling Glocks and bitch niggas that bring cops
And sling rocks for green, get the greens out
(We keep it in the fam!)
Due thing, no move fakin', get the bread, fuck the fakin'
Cause the loot is for the takin'
Ain't tryin' to be mistaken for the next John Doe
Roll with the strong flow, so I can see long dough

[Hook:]
Keep ya eyes on people, because they scopin'
Don't be gettin' caught sleepin' in these streets, with your eyes wide open
There's no right to live life, ghetto kids is trife
Do ya murk, pack ya Gat, watch yo back - Life!

[Verse 5: Gus Da Vigilante]
Living life on the streets, trife it's murder left and right
In front of my vision, most of my fams are missin'
Locked down or laid down
The plan to keep the grands, whether it's goin' hand to hand
Legal checks, doin' stick ups with tecs, get those the objects
Constant currency is the theory for livin' comfortably, indeed
Some got mouths to feed, so they push more keys than a locksmith
Some lay stiff, cause of loose lips
We constantly at war with forge - What for?
Cause niggas don't use they hands no more
We gettin' one to threes for packin' heat, that shit's beyond me
Cause livin' legal over illegally, we can all be bodies
Even the innocent get slain, stray bullets are never aimed
So maintain the struggle of your life

[Verse 6: Billy Danze]
Ever since the age of thirteen I had a dream, opposite of Dr. King
Cause I was amped over green
Only one way to stay alive on these streets of the feel
Where it's real, keep my steel to survive
Ready to check chumps when I catch chumps eyeing me
That's just the way niggas done fucked up society
I got a son now, and I'm getting older
(Yeah, you gotta be there with lots of gold on his shoulder)
Yeah, I know, and it's a long way to go before I end the mob
When I ain't gotta let my burner bug
Cause check it, niggas be flippin', whole missions
Shorties totin' more hammers than they holdin' that Ford Dixon
Listen, it doesn't matter who's the biggest or baddest
What matter is who's fast enough to splatter brains out this muthafucka
Livin' these ways, goin' out in a blaze, now bring me a phrase
Billy's name rephrase
(And thy shall not kill!)
Thy shall not be killed, fuckin' round on this hill
You know me, I'm emotional like Free
And my peoples from M.O.P, yeah, that'll perish they'll cherish
Niggas be dyin' over loot, so now I gotta put on a suit
And give a give a dead man a salute for his life
