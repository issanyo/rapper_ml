Yungun straight out of North London
I'm here with da Guru
I'm gonna show you how we do it
Cuz uh, these days everyone's trying to go on
Like a slick but they ain't slick
This is slick

[Verse 1: Guru]
Smashed a few reps
Came up a few steps
And I'm gonna tear it up right now
For you guests
Go right on freakin'
While the icon's speakin'
On my J-O-B
Weeknights and weekends, damn I'm so gorgeous
Blast and board us, my authority shakin'
We takin' the orders
You can't afford this, it's too expensive
Take a second, my track record's too extensive
While it all goes down, I'm the talk of the town
Soon a lot of you chumps won't be walking around
I'm so precise on any pro device
I heat it up and still I'm cold as ice
Rip the stage to the ground when I spit
My style's too complex for cowards to get
Deadly force and y'all fools already lost
Came into the game like lame's and still steady flossed

[Chorus]
We're just too slick
I said we're just too slick
Think you smooth, you don't know what smooth is
Guru, Yungun much too sick
We just too slick
I said we just too slick
We run through chicks like guns to clips
Come through like huck one huck two, spit

[Verse 2: Yungun]
I'm gonna hold down this track from my hometown
Didn't know we had the flow clown well you know now
So when we showdown, this is how it goes down
Treat 'em like Beat Street they get closed down
The flow sounds smoother then most
And all the usual boast, but ask Guru, your host
Because when it comes to slick, he's the dude who would know
I ain't know my own dick, but the truth should be told
And the truth is, I'm cold
The flow is like Dolemite, getting frozen in ice, cold pimpin'
Still I'm hot when I'm holding the mic
I get you hype like blowing a pipe
The slickest Brit since Rick, that's a hell of a claim
But I'm ahead of the game, so remember my name
It goes
Y-U-N-G-U-N
You'll see me in L-O-N-D-O-N
Believe it and I'm out

[Chorus]
We just too slick
I said we just too slick
Think you smooth, you don't know what smooth is
Guru, Yungun much too sick
We just too slick
I said we just too slick
We run through chicks like guns to clips
Come through like huck one huck two, spit

Yeah
Yo Guru
As they say out there, good lookin' out
But as we say over here, nice one bruv
