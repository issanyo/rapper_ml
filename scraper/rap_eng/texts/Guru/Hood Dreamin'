[Hook: Solar]
Daydream, I feel asleep, I'm in the flowers
For a couple of hours, what a beautiful day

[Verse: Guru]
The hood's full of kids that are thirsty and bold
I know a nigga who was busted out a hearse that he stole
Ain't no talkin' to 'em, ain't no calmin' 'em down
This ain't theatre, but he's the latest drama in town
You know dukes, he come through in a whirlwind
He don't give a fuck
He don't know the meaning of friend, yup
I seen it all in this life of mine
Most of us must resort to a life of crime
But if I don't got a gun, I use this knife of mine
If not I execute u with my mic divine
Let it be known that I do my thing
Since way back, been an Adidas and Puma king
To this day I'm always seen in the finest threads
Last MC I slayed can't find his head
Skip the long bus rides prefer to fly instead
Tell the promoter that he got two seconds to find my bread

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse: Guru]
The girls callin' me cute, while you callin' your troops
I got 'em waving white flags, guess they calling a truce
I'm so nice, I got the young thugs open
'Cause I'm just what they waitin' for, keep the night club smokin'
Jealous cats wanna get out their Glocks
'Cause every pair that I wear be fresh out the box
That's cool 'cause I can see em comin'
I send 'em hot ones with names on 'em, you can see I'm hummin'
I'm fly, just like a private helicopter
Wannabes I'ma break your ass off, hella proper
You've been waitin' for the chance to get put on
I'm self made, and your whole act is just a put on
So put on a jacket and tie, go job huntin'
You was never real, motherfucker stop frontin'
A great rapper can stand the test of time
I got some props, but now I want the rest of mine

[Hook - 2x]
