[DJ Premier scratching]
(Once again, ladies and gentleman)
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal

[Hook]
New York niggas, universal, unique
And ain't nothin' sweet, in these streets we gotta eat
New York niggas, every borough is thorough
Makin' moves today and then tomorrow

[Verse 1]
I slay my prey with excellence, eloquence and reverence
You can't compete, so I suggest you lamp
Or meet defeat at the feet of my elite fleet
I mistreat these beats like hoes and put 'em in the street
Like seven hoodlums in a jeep, I creep up on ya
Brooklyn to California, I embalm phony performers
'Cause they're actors like Leonardo DiCaprio
Don't make me wanna put down this mic, walk up, slap you, yo
And tap you, yo, and take you out of your misery
Don't ever front or go for these bitches, thinkin' you dissin' me

[Hook]
New York niggas, universal, unique
And ain't nothin' sweet, in these streets we gotta eat
New York niggas, every borough is thorough
Makin' moves today and once again, son, tomorrow
New York niggas, universal, unique
And ain't nothin' sweet, in these streets we gotta eat
New York niggas, goin' out for the loot
And most won't hesitate to cock and shoot

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, I cut deeper, you're much weaker, I crush speakers
See 'nuff heaters, yeah, in New Yitty
That's where it's grimy and gritty, word to Frank Nitti
Got strippers showin' their titties, bourgeois hoes actin' saditty
And very spot got its own ghetto
Liquor stores on all the corners, plus drugs, guns with ammo
No examples set for thugs in the projects
Only examples they get is how to unload the Tec
Out for respect, props and doe to collect
The root of it all, ya'll, is you need loot to boil
If my back's against the wall, yo, I'ma bang you until you fall, yo
Slang, slash, a buck 50, niggas is shifty
Gonna have to send more of your goons out to get me
How could you compare this here with that weak shit there?
Word to my man Sincere, we'll make you travel in fear
Like apparitions, I appear and disappear
New York in the house, so suckas play the fuckin' rear

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pay attention or get placed on suspension
Situations you gon' face beyond your comprehension
You'll be like, "Why is all these niggas after me?"
Way up shits creek (Ha!), that's where your ass will be
Actually, you brought this shit all on yourself
Now, niggas is schemin' all on your wealth
Future health is in danger simply 'cause anger
Got niggas lookin' to hang ya or straight rearrange ya
You better hold your head, your better hide your bread
'Cause these niggas ain't playin', they're leavin' all victims dead
They labeled you as their next target
See, you was frontin', actin' like you was the hardest
Regardless, you know them niggas is hungry, yo
And ain't shit funny, yo, they want respect and money, yo

[Hook]

That's right, Brooklyn to California
New York City in the house
