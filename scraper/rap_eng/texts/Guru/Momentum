(Chorus: Guru and Shug)
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them

(Verse 1: Guru)
Sucka if it don't fit, don't force it
Toss it over this way, then I'll display
How I can dismantle rappers
And so called vandals get cancelled

(Verse 2: Big Shug)
Tricks are for kids, silly rap kid
Dagnabbit, tried to tag it you silly rabbit
You can't stop my uncontrollable flow
I'm on the downlow
Suckas got to go

(Chorus: Guru and Shug)
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them

(Verse 3: Guru)
Eruption, explosion mad debris flying
As my flow kicks in I'm sposed to win
And in this contest, styles are more complex than the hardest acedmics

(Verse 4: Big Shug)
Big shug moves right through like the breeze
Protected against unnatural disease
They can't stop me
I'm closing in on a cool mil
Got to make it, lyrical i'm gonna kill

(Chorus: Guru and Shug)
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them

(Verse 5: Big Shug)
Big man out on the set
Your gonna have to jet
Cause imma be down with skills
Without the tec
No need for that when I rap
I'm here to stay, I got it like that

(Verse 6: Guru)
My facial expressions serious when locked on
Momentum so intense you're saying guru rock, rock on
Check this
Mc's are left breathless from my death wish
I come in peace first, but don't make it worse

(Chorus: Guru and Shug)
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them

(Verse 7: Big Shug)
It's big shug with the monotone seduction
Reconstruction of this whole hip-hop era
The man in the streets is the man in the mirror
So it don't ever change, I'm not strange
Imma stay paid regardless

(Verse 8: Guru)
With controlled energy
Enough to steamroll a whole cavalry of mc's
They ain't equiped to get down
Now they're going to experience the let down

(Chorus: Guru and Shug)
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
My momentum has bent them
Many fellas I have sent them
When I dent them
