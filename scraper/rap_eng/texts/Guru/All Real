[Verse 1: Guru]
Just to feed my babies, I'll bite you like rabies
With my lust for the gravy, they say the Gods must be crazy
I come with it, I'm built with stilts for you midgets
While you fidget, you could get killed for your digits
This means get out my way when I'm angry
Male groupies on drugs, fake thugs acting strangely
This is northern alliance, I go to war with a science
Whether it's peace or violence, I keep a piece that's silent
This means when I test my weapon
Best to get to steppin
My aim is good like it shouldn't stop ??? bettin
You put your life on the line, I got your wife on the line
I use a rifle this time, I'm a triflin kind with a frightening mind
What kind of barrell do you like? What kind you had in mind?
This means I'm well prepared like DeNiro in Ronin
Cut off your head like Conan, check what I'm holding

[Verse 2: Bless]
Top notch rocka, got props like Big Poppa
Funk Doca, red leg, the punk stopper
Flyer than a helicopter, rhyme dropper
Lines like a teleprompter bent off of vodka
Classic like an opera, hip-hop imposters recieving Oscars
Playin the role of rastas, big willies and mobstas
Closte you got to Italiano was pasta
Get fresh, or get ?benokered?
Gte conquered by the rhyme monster
Click clocka, toys like Tonka
Greatest B-Boy, I rock more sneakers than Foot Locker
Hooks I offer, rhyme book, I be the author
On mics I'm getting jiggy with it, wait, I gotcha
You want dollars like Sean Carter to ball up in the plaza?
I bomb like Gaza cause I was born into this drama
Spawned from a ???, we fam no longer
Now you pause at my game, I maintain and grow wiser

[Hook: Lil Dap sample x2]
Just to let ya'll know, everything is all real
Just to let ya'll know, everything is all real
Just to let ya'll know, everything is all real
Today, this whole rap game is getting more ill

[Verse 3: Kreem.com]
I represent live niggas living it up
I live any wife quicker, they'll be giving it up
Leaving em stuck, I'm stupid cuz we ruthless as fuck
What makes you think I wouldn't bust mine and dip in a Benz truck
Eventually I'm even stronger than these average rappers
I got a plan to live longer and evade disaster
The sinister thugged out minister, not diggin ya
Style or profile, you wild, well I'm more realer
I stick to the scrolls to murder your scripts
The greatest story never told, this ain't no fantasy shit
Your majesty spits like no other
Or you can catch on stage with my younger brother, my right hand
Shit we move and expand, it's murder for life
Am I my brother's keeper? Yes I am, but I ain't Wes Snipes
Strikes like F-15s to come for ya'll like white men
If you see them spitting M16s, holla

[Verse 4: Black Jesus]
I pump guns for ones, love sums
Get stacked in tons on Halloween the size of pump guns
Puff chumps in the hood is the motto, trust none
Play the block, pick one of your chickens and pluck one
Niggas hand off cats for the rush when I hunt one
And I got gats that reach out and touch someone
So I don't gotta squeeze triggers, I got guerillas
Who go bannanas on niggas who think they ''Coo Coo For Cocoa Puffs'
Choke folks up, leave cats gagging
Can't say shit, but a minute to go is braggin
It's dot damnit, I got hoes, my mink's draggin
Like G Rap, my style of rhyme is designed with fashion
I'm classic, like ol lingo, got a dog named Bingo
And I jingle your balls like Criss Cringle
I'm on a highway dog, just dippin it
It's serious lizard shit, my afro's out with a platinum pick in it

[Outro: Guru talking]
Yeah that's right, holla at your boy
The Big GU-izzy, CEO Ill Kid Records

Uh yeah I got my man Bless up in here
