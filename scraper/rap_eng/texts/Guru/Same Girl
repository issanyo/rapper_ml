ARJUN
I met this girl only last saturday
Since then I've been living in a fantasy
She and I fell in love instantly

GURU
Tenu mein apni baare dasdan
Hai ohde jehi sohni
Tu vekhi nhi honi
Lakk patla rang gora

ARJUN
You just gotta see her
The girl is a winner
Ain't no competition, she holding the crown

GURU
Hai ohde kol Audi
Te paundi Armani
Dil le gayi marjaani

ARJUN
She only wears the best
She's rocking her Chanel
It's almost like we're dating the same, the same girl

GURU
Teri akhiyan ch pyar hai mera
Tu hi te ik yaar hai mera
Tere naal dil raat rahan mein
Jiva te tere naal maran mein

ARJUN
Hate to admit it but we fell for the same girl
Can't believe that we fell for the same girl
Don't wanna say it but you know it's the same girl
We've been loving the same girl

VERSE 2

ARJUN
Tell me more, tell me more about this girl
She seems to be a little too familiar
All the things that you've been saying 'bout her
Remind me of my own, of my own lover

ARJUN
She's got the cutest little dimples
She makes it look so simple
I'm telling you she's one of a kind

GURU
Ohdiyan vi gallan vich toye
Te ohde asi hoye
Ohde wargi na koi

ARJUN
Bro I've got this feeling
That you and me are dealing
With the same girl and she's playing us both

GURU
Mainu v eho lagge
Asi jehri kudi piche
Saade naal khed di

GURU
Teri akhiyan ch pyar hai mera
Tu hi te ik yaar hai mera
Tere naal dil raat rahan mein
Jiva te tere naal maran mein

ARJUN
Hate to admit it but we fell for the same girl
Can't believe that we fell for the same girl
Don't wanna say it but you know it's the same girl
We've been loving the same girl

BRIDGE

ARJUN
She's been leading us along
We've been playing the same song
And it's time we set this straight once and for all

GURU
Teri akhiyan ch pyar hai mera
Tu hi te ik yaar hai mera
Tere naal dil raat rahan mein
Jiva te tere naal maran mein

ARJUN AD LIBS
You're the only one
I gave you all my love
Are you lying next to him
Are you loving the same, loving the same
I only live for you
Girl I would have died for you
Are you loving him the same?
We've fallen for the same, same girl
