[Hook]
We see you kids up in here
We in the parking lot we like to spark a lot
We see you kids up in here
I'm with a nine to blaze and with a rhyme to paste
We see you kids up in here
Aiiyo fuck the fame you better tuck up your change
We see you kids up in here
And yo most of all, we're supposed to ball

[Verse 1]
I come off the top broke, like WWF
[?] junked out god of rap
The feds say an ese say I'm hard to catch
I'm on grind daily, I want larger stacks
Can't cool with a grudge, fuck a vacation
You still alive, realize; you're lucky, be patient
The T-R-U-T-H, we great
Never compromise with styles and powers we made
And we hate how you most be talking
You not a thug, say wassup and keep walking
Ladies and gents
Let it be known that like your father I pay the crazy expense
Put your mind right
You might find light
And if not, me and my dirty still gon' shine bright
We ill kids up in this ill biz
And please acknowledge what we build with
We kill shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yea we supposed to ball
Stop holdin me, yall
Why you pushing up all up close on me poor
Coming on right and exact, with the rightful attack
Stop dreaming, I used to be just like you in fact
Never, no 808's spit razor blades
Me and my man's linking up to getting major paid
Word to Muskabeatz, got love for the streets
When I get home, my girl give me hugs so sweet
Hug yo heat, nigga yea, love that gun
But never think a nigga won't plug you sun
When I come through it's like bloods and crips
A thug with kids, my peeps know what's up and shit
And certainly you can be hurting me
Break you off something properly, police emergency
We ill kids up in this ill biz
And please acknowledge what we build with
We kill shit

[Hook]

[Cut]
Up in here
Got love for the streets
Muskabeatz
Gang Starr
Muskabeatz, got love for the streets
