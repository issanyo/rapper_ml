(Chorus: Big Shug)
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends

(Verse 1: Malachi The Nutcracker)
Yo, I'm only 15 but I be rolling like a battle cat
And yo I'm ready to flip when there's combat
Beef i'm not having that
Yo, I pull the trigger back
Now all you pussy niggas know where my heart is at
I like to stay down low, but yo I flip at times
Like when I'm kicking rhymes or busting tec 9's
So called friends make the nut go wild

(Verse 2: Lil' Dap)
I'm your friend til the end like chucky says now
Never knew what was next always watched my steps
I been through all they shady shit plus the if's and the but's
Better watch your step or your bound to get bust
Never know what's next in this trife kinda life
Brothers losing their lifes when they flow with the mic
Did everything in my life without my father in my life
Normal fights everynight cause shit wasn't right

(Chorus: Big Shug)
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends

(Verse 3: Lil' Dap)
Check it
Eighteen years old lil dap formed the army
Little punks and sons running home for their mommy
Fully just strapped ready for combat
Motherfuckers started snitching for a kamikaze attack
Dap too wise that's why I formed the fucking crew
Niggas came with a zoo, everybody knew
Everybodys fucking with this hardcore slang
Make the punks remain cause my styles just the same
Niggas just don't know how shit got to go
In the city of new york where brooklyn brothers stalk

(Chorus: Big Shug)
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends

(Verse 4: Malachi The Nutcracker)
Yo troop on any block with my gangster bop
Your crew I clock and the bitches they jock
Saying "Damn, he's coming off at a young age, only 15 and hitting the good stage"
But don't worry bout me cause I'm making
And if I can't have it then I'm taking it
That's how it is cause I'm living trife
Rolling the dice take a chance with your life
Niggas I mutilate, nothing can penetrate
Rapper disintegrate, I'm setting your murder date
Lets grab our fucking guns and start to invade
A hitman for hire and I gotta get paid
Cause bullets are sprayed and many bodies are layed
More money is made and that's the family trade
See I take cash when I step in the casino
So if you got beef then come and step in my arena

(Chorus: Big Shug)
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends, my so called friends
My friends

(Outro: Lil' Dap)
Ayo that's ill
Makaveli taught us how to get ill
You know what I'm saying?
We kick some shit like that
You know, grab a chick and get ill
I got a plan
