[Guru]
Mmm, is this really the end, or is it a new beginning?
A new reality..

Chorus: Guru + Baybe (repeat 2X)

So many misconceptions (don't be misled)
So many evil deceptions (oh I am)
I've come to give direction
For I, am the lifesaver (the life)

[Guru]
Scooby doo wah, scooby doo wee
Like a jazz player, I improvise wisely
Free with the style, I flow like the Nile
But remember, don't mistake the smile
Deep rooted is my rhymin
Like ancient African griots, precise is my timing
But let me get to the essence of what I'm sayin here
Too many blood red streets with bodies layin there
The systematic fanatics are at it again
Tryin to kill me and all of us my friend
But don't bend to the mental strain
Against all odds, we must strive for essential gains
Be true to the life the Lord gave ya
And that's a message from the lifesaver
The lifesaver..

Chorus

[Baybe]
Oh I am, the life (I.. am the lifesaver)
I am, the life.. yeah

[Guru]
It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight
Than to set one off, knowledge I'll let some off
Cause nowadays, everybody's a killer
And as for me, no other MC is iller
But still a thorn scrapes my heart
When I see another life that's been torn apart
Over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence
That the money only takes precedence
Cause everybody wants power
While the innocent are born or die, during every hour
I scowl as I look upon evil
But I must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people
And we will learn to respect our neighbors
Another message from the lifesaver
The lifesaver..

Chorus

[Guru]
People talk about the Armaggedeon
And nowadays everyone you know is packin lead son
Each day's another test
Aiyyo I better do my best, cause a lot's ridin on my chest
So when I lead you to the water, you best know
How to swim across, so you can reach the border
It's international, the message and the flavor
So here's some more important words from the lifesaver
The lifesaver.. (I am the life)
The lifesaver..

[Lucien]
Garçon, fâché, grandissant dans la violence et la pisse
Le mot peace, c'est pour ceux qui périssent
Chaque jour, aux alentours, dans le monde et ses tours
En prison ou retour en arrière dans les fours
Et les condés font leur rondes, les villes grondent
La terre chauffe les sommets de montagne fondent
Blondin ça passe black ça casse
Tel est mon uniforme dans une guerre entre races
On me regarde, me met en garde, à vue
Certains cafardent, d'autres bavardent, et tuent
Dédicace à tout quartier, toute cité, aux pas de chance
à ceux qui sont tombés mais pas pour la France
Pays trop bidon, vivement Armageddon
J'ai raison, priant Jéhovah pour mon pardon
Car si un flic me juge je le droite
Enfonçant mon doigt dans son oeil et le fond de son cerveau je gratte
... (Goes off to fade)

[Guru]
So many misconceptions
So many evil deceptions
I've come to give direction
For I, am the lifesaver
