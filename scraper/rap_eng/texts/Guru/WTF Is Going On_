Parental advisory, another black commodity
Spit the woes of the chill black society
Tryna be real amidst animosity
Gonna make it bigger than that rapper named Cassidy
Chastity, somebody give me some clarity
Why we spending on the wrong things rather charity
Unless Charity comes in the room wearing nada
Telling you she’ll suck you for a Gucci or a Prada
So you give her everything plus the dollar and the dream
Just to make you bang like a Philippine granada
Maan, that’s just plain stupid, You just need a mate
Lemme call you Mr. cupid
Caught you dreaming lucid, starr on the beat
Imma use it
Motherfucker choose it
Before you make a bad decision and you lose it
Cause people like conforming to the norm
Wanna be cool doing things that are wrong
So this is what I’m really tryna say in this song

Question that i mentioned: Wtf is going on?
Question that i mentioned: Wtf is going on? wtf is going on?
Question that i mentioned: Wtf is going on?


As i walk thru the valley of the shadow of death
That’s what they use to rap until they run out of breath
So i break my neck, keeping my lines in check
Risking every bars i spit, just to gain respect
So now please, listen as i cheese
All the opportunities down to my knees
To see behind those many trees
My lines better knock you out like an Enzo T
Cause that’s just how he be
And this is how I do
Sometimes i’m really bad but sometimes i’m really true
My lyrics stick to you just like it’s really glue
Forget about the past, you be chilling with the new
He finally left that bitch, now i call him iller Q
He be chilling with the crew; so you
Better listen to me when i flow
I’m the young kid who they really wanna know
They really wanna know and they really wanna meet
They say make another one, i had to kill the beat
Cause this is what they need, and this is what they ask
She just paid for school but she hasn’t paid for class
She finny turn up in her baby daddy’s pad
Looking kinda sad, but they feeling kinda bad
Thinking of the roses she’s never gonna have
And if you feel i’m just thinking way up top
Young fella this is mu'fucking hip hop

So this is what I’m really tryna say in this song
Question that i mentioned: Wtf is going on?
Wtf is going on?
