From every city, every coast, international
Everywhere I go they know I'm international
Speak they language like a pro, international
If you don't know now you know I'm international

I'm a tell you like this, kid
I'm a well-known legend with a flow that's liquid
You can front if you want to
But you'll never get the love that I get when I come through
Doesn't matter where I go
Country to country I do my thing like a pro
I got the worldwide charm
Might see me with two or three girls on my arm
Always on the job, never frown at work
I'm never scared of the fans 'cause I'm down to earth
They all talkin, oh what's up now?
My name is good, I'm on the come-up now
Other guys are local
While I'm known everywhere for my buttery vocals
Me and the God got the game on tap
And this kind of thing goes way beyond rap

Every city, every coast, international
Everywhere I go they know I'm international
Speak they language like a pro, international
If you don't know now you know I'm international

From every city, every coast, international
Everywhere I go they know I'm international
Speak they language like a pro, international
If you don't know now you know I'm international
International

Dash to the airport, flight's at nine
I'm a jet-setter, and she likes it fine
I got style and intrigue
She wants a grown-man type that plays in the big leagues
Keep it thorough, that's what I do
Most likely I'll be passing by you
Philly to Spain roll my phillies the same
The deal goin' down while I'm killing the game
No entourage needed
'Cause I don't like to make a scene and I ain't conceited
I'm convinced of a few things
I get love for the way I make the microphone do things
Chi-Town to Jamaica
From New York to Chile I'm a stone-cold heartbreaker
UK to Japan
Ask about me, dawgs, and they'll tell you I'm the man

Every city, every coast, international
Everywhere I go they know I'm international
Speak they language like a pro, international
If you don't know now you know I'm international

From every city, every coast, international
Everywhere I go they know I'm international
Speak they language like a pro, international
If you don't know now you know I'm international

If you don't know about me
Go 'head and ask about me
Whatever language you speak, you can catch me overseas
To all the paparazzi
They'll want a picture of me
Go 'head and snap a shot, it's worth a million bucks
Girls, girls, all over the world
Get your passports and visas ready
Get your luggage don't pack too heavy, travel the
World, world, first-class, non-stop
And we don't need no cash at all
'Cause we international

From every city, every coast, international
Everywhere I go they know I'm international
Speak they language like a pro, international
If you don't know now you know I'm international

Everywhere I go they know I'm international

If you don't know now you know I'm international
