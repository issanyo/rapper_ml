[Chorus]
Money, cars, clothes, give me all of that
FLows, shows, hoes, I got all of that
Sex, teks, checks, give me all of that
Cribs, chicks, whips, I got all of that

[Verse 1]
If you want to know just how I feel
Then fall back boy, while I'm adjusting my steel
I'm a semi short nigga but my game is tall
I like money, clothes, cars just the same as y'all
Been down in the dirt and it was hard to come up
Had to grind like a motherfucker, sun down to sun up
Me and my niggas used to dream of this
Now it's all on me, I do my thing with this
Blast at you rapper cats, slash past your battle raps
You're in the hospital, body cast after that
One of the realest you could ever meet
Get love in every hood 'cause I rep the streets with clever speech
You'll never reach, my legendary status
MY presence is alarming, my chicks be the baddest
So nigga just close your mouth
I close you down and take everything like open house

[Chorus]- 2X

[Verse 2]
Yall fools don't want it, word to my moms
I can see it in your eyes that you scurred to be harmed
And I don't give a damn if you, came with your man or crew
Still gon' have to dismantle you and hammer you
Don't let me catch you, after dark
I'll snatch your heart when the desert E sparks
I'm nice with a two, might fight with a fool
Why I'm spazing, 'cause I don't be liking y'all fools
And niggas front 'cause I could bag they broad
I don't want they bitch, they could have their broad
I'm on some businesses, a mansion, a yacht
See I'm a winner girl, that man ain't got what I got
I work for the riches baby, hurt from the stitches baby
Stay alert and go beserk just to get the gravy
So nigga just close your mouth
I close you down and take everything like open house

[Chorus]
