INTRO (YlooK)
Uh..T dot O to the N dot Y
That's how we do it
Choclair, Kardinall hooked with my man Guru
And YlooK bitch? What the f**k?

(Choclair)
Yo, T-dot rocks y'all
We smoke and mix up in your face, you weeded
So you drop y'all, leaving y'all hired skills depleated
'Cause you lockjaw, Chocs and Guru begin
Can you believe this how we lock y'all
Niggas who be talking how they bigger
How you figure?
You can spark with or talk with
This raw artist
You talk heartless but game straight harmless
Snatch your mic out your hand
Leave your fingers harmless
We rottweilers, while y'all be the tires
You need to retire
F**king with Toronto, get your pink slip you're fired
Kicked out the Thompson Hall through Apollo doors
Guru be the bre-the-ren
Bless the man, slide like the doors on the Caravan
(Guru)
The ill format, the skills all that
Twist enemies Jack
Let's counteract, plus build and all that
In fact, take a flight to Toronto and back
Be over there with Choclair, Kardinall with the track
In the year born born, suckers have been forewarned
Take you higher than hydro or Moet ??
Word is bond, it's on in this rap game
I slap mens, mack dames, yes I'm a fly black king
Stacking paper now, packing flavour now
Hit you dead in the head now
My hunger gotta get fed now
My style's similar to a fierce knuckle hit
Or like hollow-points to pierce your whole f**king frame

CHORUS X2 (Choclair) {Guru}
A-yo witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact that you can't do shit
{Witness the fitness}
{Who's next on the hitlist?}

{Rap so exact you catch the shakes like a sickness}

(Choclair)
Now it's the skinny man dropping this
Lock your brain, lock your lips
Talking shit? Bust your game
Career flops? I'm to blame
What's the name? (yeah)
Guru and the Chocs will reign
Wild like the lion's mane walking through the rain
Or walking through the pain of critic suffering
Got my eyes on the prize with the red dot locked
That's to keep it hot
My hungry-ass niggas be down for the figures
Green in the jean, Cruise like some act figures
You f**king with some raw, suave, dog ass niggas
Look into the eyes of the man that will be detrimental to your career
If you even touch the micstand, nigga 'nuff said

Verse 4: Guru
Hear the battle cry
Niggas getting herded like cattle to die
Why? (why?) What the f**k you think? (what the f**k you think?)
You know they want our type of species to become extinct
Still we multiply, they can't really kill us
They're upset, we're a threat 'cause their kids really feel us
They think we're drug dealers, and some of us maybe are
But I be the G-U-R-U of the Gang to the Starr
I'm going far baby pa, dipping in a fly car
Getting eyes from the honeys, parking up at the bar
Always up to par when I spar
And yo, while your protecting your neck I be like breaking your jaw
Yo trizzack, your shit's wizzack
I took that shit thizzack, it shouldn't of even been up on the rizzack
Straight like thizzack, motherf**kers

CHORUS

A-yo witness the fitness
Who's next on the hitlist?
Rap so exact that you can't do shit
