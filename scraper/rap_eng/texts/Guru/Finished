Niggas be bitches
I look in they face, and they flinchin'
They look in my face and I bet they can tell I'm a menace
I got an army, my dogs is heartless
Z like the sergeant, and I'm the lieutenant

I remember talking at Lenox
I had like 5 racks, then spent it all on denims
I'm breaking records, I promise
By the time I'm finished with this I'ma go down in Guinness

Word to Drake, if them hoes see a Benz
Even if it's rented, they gon' wanna get in it
Stupid-ass, lame-ass â€“ ah, I'm trippin'
I'm so pissed off I can't finish my sentence

I keep it true, yeah, I live with no limits
Everything I do them niggas try to mimic
Soon as I get on the beat, I kill it
And I mix that shit up like a chemist

I'm going hard for my city
I got New Orleans here with me
You try me, nine times out of ten
You'll get shot nine times just like 50

My pockets finna be fat like Biggie
I feel like a don, I feel like I'm litty
I ain't had none, now I got plenty
All-black Air Force 1s with the Dickies

I'm off the Henn, the shit got me bent
All this money goin' round got me dizzy
That's why your broad wanna give me a hickey
She took off her bra, and she showed me her titties

I'm boutta act a dog in her kitty
I'm boutta make it ride and pop a wheelie
I got the 9 on me, don't tempt me
I'll let the chopper sing like Whitney
