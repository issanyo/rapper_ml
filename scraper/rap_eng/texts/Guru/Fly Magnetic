[Chorus]
He's got a (?) so great and I
Only know his nature fly
He do something to me
That magnetic won't let me be
He don't even have to try
?????
On and on and on babe
When he's around I can't maintain

[Verse 1: Guru]
What would you do if I snatch up your cutie pie?
Take her to Cooley High, mold her up and beautify
Not that I'm after her, more like she's after me
Saying she wants me, she's saying we have to be
Can't get her off my case, want her to stop the chase
Want me like crazy glue, I told her to stay with you
Loving my charming whip, don't want no part of this
No time for tricks, I'm in the mix like Spartacus
More like Hannibal, with thoughts like Confucious
Sending her home to you but I've seen how it's useless
I told her to back away, left now she's back today
Thought you had her in check, got my own chick so (?)
She don't want designer clothes, wants me to slide close
I said take it easy, she just wants to please me
Not because my fame or my rhyme aesthetics
It's because of my ways and my fly magnetic

[Chorus]
He's got a (?) so great and I
Only know his nature fly
He do something to me
That magnetic won't let me be
He don't even have to try
?????
On and on and on babe
When he's around I can't maintain

[Verse 2: Guru]
Phone's ringing off the hook, honeys they often look
Getting go off the books, some rappers are often shook
Goodness gracious, her crib was spacious
With maximum head room, to the bedroom I take this
I read her the riot act, searching for wire taps
Soon as I finish, next minute, she lying back
Rich like Benny, more gangster then most
Got the keys to the whip, I got more game then a coach
Satisfied to the brim, she brags to her friends
She's on it like hot sauce, we're at it again
In the car, at the crib, in the office and more
In the club, on the yacht, on the beach house floor
I'm the one she's been looking for, youthful and so mature
They call me a connoisseur, she screaming for me
Not because of my fame, or my rhyme aesthetics
It's cuz of my ways, and my fly magnetic

[Chorus]
He's got a (?) so great and I
Only know his nature fly
He do something to me
That magnetic won't let me be
He don't even have to try
?????
On and on and on babe
When he's around I can't maintain

He's gotta give so great
Get on up
Without my strength, it's hard to give it up
Aw baby, aw baby, that thing, magnetic you do

High so fly, want your soul
Try my best to let it go
Aw baby, aw baby, that thing, magnetic you do'

[Repeat Chorus]
