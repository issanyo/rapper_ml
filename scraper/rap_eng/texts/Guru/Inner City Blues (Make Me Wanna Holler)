Some people live in guilt, consumed in sorrow
Settin' themselves up for a doomed tomorrow
I learned a great deal from what life has shown
Like don't follow the crowd, get a life of your own
I ran the streets crazy, seen every kind of sickness
I had to get a grip, and straighten up with the quickness
Scrapes with the law, problems with the crib
Did my share of robbin' and nearly had to do a bid
Experience has taught me to check myself
And keep a balance to your physical and mental health
If I don't  give it to you homie then who's gonna?
Instead of choosing peace so many choose drama
Compulsive behavior, irrational statements
Lead to errors and blunders in actual cases
Some people treat themselves with no respect
As for me, I'm making moves with no regret
Still it makes me wanna holler
Holler
[Instrumental]
Look up in the sky at the constellations
Look into your soul feel the revelation
Your mind in its most positive state
Will connect with others who equally relate
The planets come together in a peaceful formation
So we can surpass the pain and degradation
Suffering and sacrifice will not be in vain
Cause the beauty that is truth will always remain
Makes me wanna holler
[Instrumental]
And this is the moment when the tables will turn
When the lies the myths and the fables will burn
And that which is pure will then shine through
So it's time to leave the negative thoughts behind you
Inhale and breathe the good air in
Exhale, release impurities within
If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything
Let's see what this new day brings
And still it makes me wanna holler
Holler
[Instrumental]
And this is the moment when the tables will turn
When the lies the myths and the fables will burn
And that which is pure will then shine through
So it's time to leave the negative thoughts behind you
Inhale and breathe the good air in
Exhale, release impurities within
If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything
Let's see what this new day brings
And still it makes me wanna holler
[Instrumental outro]
