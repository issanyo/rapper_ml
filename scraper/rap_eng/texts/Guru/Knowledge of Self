United we stand, stand, stand
United we stand

Get some
If you want some
Come and get, get, get
If you want some, want some, want some, want some

If you want some

Yo, I'm ready to go, ready to go, ready to go, ready to go
Let my energy flow
Ready to go, ready to go, ready to go, ready to go
Let my energy flow
Ready to go
Let my energy flow

Steadily, bro
Scaring off the enemy, yo
Progression, while I'm releasing aggression
In this rap profession
I keep other cats guessin'
International player, pure poet
More devoted, but more soul than y'all know it
Voted as a spokesman for people with dreams
Feeding my team
Out in front and leading the scene

Don't they see the world's tired of them
They're lying again
Got the music dying again, nah
Don't they see the world's tired of them
They're lying again
Got the music dying again, nah
Don't they see the world's tired of them
They're lying again
Got the music dying again, nah

I can't let it go down
We can throw down
I'll meet you on the block
And we can have a showdown

If you want some
If you want some
If you want some, want some
If you want some

So here we are in these last days
It's grimy and nasty
Refined is my mind
I'm keeping some of my pathways
Jerks always want to take kindness for weakness
Revealing secrets
Knowing I be dealing deep shit
It's all good, I'm growing stronger daily
I'm father to babies, I bomb you crazy
Got more knowledge
Than you can get from the Internet
I spit wisdom that I get from introspect

Don't they see the world's tired of them
They're lying again
Got the music dying again, nah
Don't they see the world's tired of them
They're lying again
Got the music dying again, nah
Don't they see the world's tired of them
They're lying again
Got the music dying again, nah

I can't let it go down
We can throw down
I'll meet you on the block
And we can have a show down

If you want some, come and get some
If you want some, come and get some
If you want some, come and get some
If you want some, come and get some

If you want some, come and get some
If you want some, come and get some
If you want some, come and get some
If you want some, come and get some
