[Verse 1]
My name is...
Shake Zula, the mic rulah, the old schoolah
You wanna trip, I'll bring it to ya
Frylock, and I'm on top, rock you like a cop
Meatwad you're up next with your knock-knock

[Bridge]
Dancing is forbidden
Dancing, forbidden

[Verse 2]
Meatwad make the money, see
Meatwad get the honies, G
Drivin in my car, livin' like a star
Ice on my fingers and my toes
And I'm a Taurus

[Bridge]
Hah, check, check it, yeah
Hah, check, check it, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens
Make the homies say, "Ho"
And the girlies wanna scream
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens
Make the homies say, "Ho"
And the girlies wanna scream

[Outro]
Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Number one in the hood, G
