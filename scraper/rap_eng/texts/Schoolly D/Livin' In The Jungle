Now I'm a legacy, you know I keep goin'
In my mind, and mind it keep flowin'
Mowin' and towin' and showin', I'm just knowin'
I'm goin' upstream, so I keep on rowin'
I reach for a new plan, a dope new level
Schoolly D, baby, a hip hop rebel
On a back out road of the suckers that blowed
And movin' like gravity, me and Code
Straight from the Ave, takin' over like rover
And don't dig what I'm sayin', then roll the fuck over
Cold and bold, so you been told
Call me on the phone, tell me I went gold
I don't understand, my man, we need a plan
Why I gotta walk with a gun in my hand?
Lookin' for a fight to incite, or a rumble
Don't know why... cause I'm livin' in the jungle

This is my start, playin' my part, rap is my art
Steady like a go kart
King, or Queen, or Prince, are just Neros
Sit on back and listen to your hero
On a microphone, school, and just persuin'
On stage I never hear booin'
Winnin' and grinin', chin in, I never sin in
And just like Genesis I'm the beginin'
Here from the left, 900 I sip
Open up your mind, baby let's take a little trip
On reality, the past and the present
Skin too dark so you treat me like a peasant
I don't understand, my man, we need a plan
Why I gotta walk with a gun in my hand?
Lookin' for a fight to incite, or a rumble
I don't know why... cause I'm livin' in the jungle
