[Verse 1]
My age is young, my money is green
I shock all the ladies with my gangster lean
Well Flash cut the record down to the bone
They always got me rocking on the microphone
Come on young lady, cool out and chill
Check my man out on the wheels of steel
Cuts galore, rhymes galore
And you see young lady dancing on the floor
Cuz you sucker emcees, trying to cut my ryhme
Got the girls downtown, standing in my line
Got the ? president, trying to shake my hand
Got the number to you girl, and trying to land
Got an office downtown, with secretary brown
Girls and girls, hanging all around
Got the cheeba and the black, def cad-i-lac
Butter on popcorn, you know that they can ?

[Verse 2]
Young lady, don't be shady
Come and take a ride in my Mercedes
Up to downtown, all around the world
I love to see young fly girl
With their hair so long, skin so divine
You listen to me to say another emcee rhyme
Tarzan and Jane, was sitting in the tree
F U and C, K I N and G
Tarzan fell, and bust his ass
Because on the mix, was T-Ski Flash
Cheetah got hot, stuck it to Jane
Now the G-House rock can never be the same

Emcee X6

[Verse 2]
On the corner, selling some weed
And then came along, a sucker emcee
Say, yo Holmes, whats up with that?
And can I cop me, a nickel bag sack?
I said, a nickel bag, is Ninety Nine
You can't deal you better bite some rhyme
And then I laid down this MC rhyme
I said, ??, and glorious grand
He came along and put a mic in my hand
And then you shocked all the females all across the land
Then came along, singin a song
We wrapped the whole damn block and we never went wrong
Flash cut the record down to the bone
MC will you rhyme like a microphone
Then mix master, you cut it faster
Mix master cuttin it up faster
Mix master Mark, on the wheels of steel
He's layin down the rhythm, layin down the real deal
When he was born, his mother gave birth
To the baddest DJ on the whole damn Earth
He picked up the mix, he put it in his hand
He shocked all the females all across the land
Mix master, mix master, mix master cut a little faster
I was coming home one night, on the L
Insane MC tried to snatch my ?
I said, "Yo homes, whats up with that?"
I pulled my 8 and he gave it back
He reached in his pocket pulled a bottle of wine
He asked me to say this MC rhyme
I said

[Hook]
