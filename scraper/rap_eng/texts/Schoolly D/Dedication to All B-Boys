This rhyme's dedicated to all my homeboys back there, in Parkside Ave
And to all b-boys alike, this one's for you

Young girls are my weakness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness

This rhyme is dedicated to all b-boys
All other suckers you will be destroyed
Parkside Ave is where I'm from
Smokin' cheeba every day and everybody gotta gun
Long [?] rock and rollas
Move aside suckas 'cause you know we're takin' over
Pullin' our guns in MC faces
I don't give a damn about creed or races
You gettin' in my way you will be destroyed
This rhyme is dedicated to all b-boys

Young girls are my weakness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness

I overheard somebody say you was my boy
But the day that I met you never seen you before
What's wrong with your brain is you going insane?
I say you homie-homie, stop smokin' cane
Your breathe still [?] makin' you step back
Because of cheeba cheeba it's so easy [?] rap
Call your girl, known as Stacey
Put it together and you got yourself a lacey

Young girls are my weakness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness

[?] sippin' [?]
Coat around my neck and I know that you want it
But don't try to rush me for what I got
I'm takin' out suckers 'cause you will be shot
I came to the party, whoops I [?]
Eat a lot of beef, but I don't eat [?]
Don't have to dance, standin' in my stance
And on the table chillin' hard is my homeboy Lance
Gettin' in my way you will be destroyed
This rhyme is dedicated to all b-boys

Young girls are my weakness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness

Young girls are my weakness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness
