(Intro)
Yeah, wassup
I wanna ask black america a motherfucking question
How come everytime we get a new president, we think they're gonna save out black ass?
Those motherfuckers in Washington DC don't give a fuck about you
Yeah, check it out

(Verse 1)
Welcome to america, you better get your gat
Because the niggas in parkside got my back
Pulling up in fat lincolns and fat caddies
Motherfuckers heading straight for their daddy
Slanging dope, motherfuckas is selling keys
Bringing bitch motherfuckers down to their knees
Yeah motherfucker, lets trip
I like it when your bitch ass slip
I'm in your face motherfucker, what you gonna do?
A motherfucker like me pull a gang or two
Damn, they got me living in america
Where the brother gotta get the esoterica
They make my skin white and bright and white
Cause if it ain't get my ass ready for the fight
Let me tell you my sisters and brothers
If you're too dark gonna treat you like a sucka
But i'm gonna let my head kink up
Give me some cheeb and a 40 imma drink up
A don't give me that S curl, kid
Cause I ain't for that  jerry curl shit
I ain't changed this I never re-arranged this
Cause I the black motherfucka that's saying this
Land of the freak, the home of the brave
America was raised on the blood of the black slave
It's 93 school's still schoolin', code money my nigga still rulin'
But gotta keep telling what the scope is
Who the punk, who the bitch, who the hoe is
How many niggas gotta get smoked?
How many smoke?
Yo, so where's the joke?

(Chorus)
Yeah, welcome to america
Welcome to america niggas
Welcome to america
Welcome to america niggas
Yeah

(Verse 2)
I gotta flow on, nigga gotta show on
Punk motherfuckers like you, you gotta go on
Motherfucker gotta make another move
If I pull my gat, my niggas got my back
Talking about where you're going and where you're from
It's all about where you're at, blac
You're living in the street like a motherfucking animal
Because you're black they think it's understandable
Can't you see america is sick
I'll pull a gat on your ass real quickly
So don't you think that i'll ever be hesitant
To pull a gat on the motherfucking president
I wanna get him, lynch him up like a nigga
He ain't nothing but a bitch I figure
How many niggas gotta get smoked?
How many smoke?
Yo, so where's the joke?

(Chorus)
Welcome to america
Welcome to america niggas
Welcome to america
Welcome to america niggas
