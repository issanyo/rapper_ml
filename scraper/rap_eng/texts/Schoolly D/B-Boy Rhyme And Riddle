(Chorus)
B-boys in the front, back, side and middle check out my b-boy rhyme and riddle
My DJ code money standing in the middle
Hey diddle, diddle with the record like a fiddle

(Chorus)
B-boys in the front, back, side and middle check out my b-boy rhyme and riddle
My DJ code money standing in the middle
Hey diddle, diddle with the record like a fiddle

(Verse 1)
Not one, not two, not three, but four fly girls knocking at my door
I let em' all in, one was a whore
Took her to my room laid her on my bed
Said "Listen baby doll don't you be mislead, we drink a little brew and we smoke some kill before I lay you down is you on the bill?"
She got irate, stupid and ill
Slapped her in the face, said "Wait, bitch chill!"
Threw her out the window and who did I see?
About four motherfuckers staring back at me
Smoking cheeba cheeba man and having some fun
Til one motherfucker pulled a gun
He had a .22, so I pulled my 8
I never seen a motherfucker like that before gate

(Chorus)
B-boys in the front, back, side and middle check out my b-boy rhyme and riddle
My DJ code money standing in the middle
Hey diddle, diddle with the record like a fiddle

(Verse 2)
Threw on my silk shirt and my fila shoes
Stepped into the mirror said my two one two's
My mother how I ducked said "Jesse the phone"
On the way down I slapped my sister in the dome
She said "Ow", so I threw her on the couch
Kicked me in the balls, so I had to break out
Opened up the door jumped down the steps
I landed on my feet it worked, yet yes, bet
Stepped to the corner man and who did I see?
But the same silly bitch looking back at me
I said "Say mama, mama I don't mean no harm"
And when I threw her out the window I broke the bitch arm
Listen here brother don't you be mislead about the funky ass rhyme
Til the funky bitch said "You sucka ass nigga I should shoot you dead"
So I slapped that bitch again

(Chorus)
B-boys in the front, back, side and middle check out my b-boy rhyme and riddle
My DJ code money standing in the middle
Hey diddle, diddle with the record like a fiddle
