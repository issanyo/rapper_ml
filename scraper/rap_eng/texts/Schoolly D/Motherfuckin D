Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

(CHORUS)(4x)
D motherfuckin D, motherfuckin D
Its the D, its the motherfuckin D

1, 2, 3, A, B, C, D
Here come the black nigga straight from the trees
KKK tried to hang me
Niggas tried to bang me, but it ain't no thang G
Pass me the J, and I roll me a buddah
School is the teacher and the motherfuckin tutor
Another hardcore motherfuckin on the run
Give me the mic before I key ya like a gun
I'mma kill me a Po, a pussy, and a faggot
Cause up to my neck motherfuckers I've had it
If you wanna rhyme motherfucker wanna riddle
I'm in the front cold money in the middle
I don't care about your mainstream audience
All I care about is the rubbers and the 40 ounce
If you wanna come motherfucker then come
But I tell you now, you better bring a gun

(CHORUS)

Can't fuck with the flavor, fuck what they gave ya
Schooly D nigga, I came back to save ya
Lookin at my Gucci, I tell you what it mean
Niggas on part side lickin that green
If you wanna rumble, if you wanna fight
I kick ass on Saturday night
Yes I'mma nigga, a straight up nigga
Schooly D nothin but a part side nigga
Pass me a 40, roll me the cheeba
Niggas like me and you know that we need a
Hit it, quit it, I gotta get blasted
Some motherfuckers wanna call me a bastard
Cause I'mma nigga smokin I'mma brotha
Plus I'm the motherfucker doin yo mother
So if you wanna come motherfucker then come
But I tell ya now, ya better bring ya gun

(CHORUS)

No way bitch, Schooly never switch
I'd rather put your punk ass straight in a ditch
Grab me a gat, come correct
Snap necks, for text
Straight from the Bible, you know that I'm libel
Moses told us slaves to be free
But he didn't know about the motherfuckin D
So if you wanna come motherfucker then come
But I tell ya brother, ya better bring ya gun

(CHORUS)
