(Chorus)
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone

(Verse 1)
Let me tell you a little tale about my nigga named joe
Joe had this girl sally the hoe
Sally said "Lets go to a show"
Joe had to say no they was to damn poor
Sally kinda calied and they dillied and they dallied
Looked up and down and stole the man valley
What joe did sally, hit her with a ralley, a right, a left and that's when the hoe tallied
Picked her up off the floor, threw her out the door
Said "Now bitch don't come back no more"

(Verse 2)
He went down to the ave with a nigga named moe
Moe said "Sally sell a little blow, make a little dough and i'll take you to the show"
But sally didn't know that moe had a hoe
Her name was florance but people called her flo
Flo said "Sally, uh you gots to go"
Sally got mad cause moe took the dough, sniffed all the blow, took flo to the show
Moe said "Sally one thing you should know, what you sow you reap, what you reap you sow."

(Chorus)
Because, pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck and funk and leave it alone
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
You suck it and fuck and leave it alone
