(Verse 1)
Schoolin, toolin, fooling
On the microphone I keep ruling
Ruling, rolling, tolling
Make my money, keep on strolling
Stacking, brackin, packing
On stage I be macking
Shaking, taking, not faking
On the table don't leave the bakers
Stickin, lickin, tickin
I'm like thomas I keep ticking
Hour, tour full of power
Rhymes it'll never be sour
Paging, waging, staging
Yeah, school I be raging
Facing, pacing, racing
On school, you be tracing
Stealing, dealing, wheeling
My pockets I keep filling
Towing, rowing, going
My career i'll never be throwing
Walking, talking, cocking
Yeah, school I be stalking
Kissing, dissing, vision
Yeah, girls you'll be wishing
Rhyming, timing, shining
Yeah, school i'll never be doubting

(Verse 2)
Older, bolder, colder
Schoolly D, baby a hip-hop soldier
Wearing, tearing, learing
No suckas I be fearing
Ripping, tripping, slipping
Thunderbird you know I be sipping
Silly, chilly, get illy
Me and code you know we're from philly
Yeah, so whos schooling who?
