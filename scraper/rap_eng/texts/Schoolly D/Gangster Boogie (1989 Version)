(Verse 1)
Cold like an ice berg, hot like fire
Rapping on stage while one desires
You's a bad new sucker cause a lot of pain
I'm coming down hard like thunder and rain
Rising to the top boy, while you are sinking
No brain subject, what are you thinking?
Thinking real hard and you can be like school
And make a lot of money and be real cool
I can make some rap records and make a lot of fans
People come around and shake my hand
But you can't, you won't, you're nothing but a punk
My shit is in, your shit has sunk

(Chorus)
Code money, he will amaze you!
Go off and go off and go crazy!
(Code Money scratches Chicago Gangsters - Gangster Boogie)

(Verse 2)
Toss in a J and B made three
Sitting in the tree came Eazy-E
Up came cheeta, then came floyd, cause then came lion we call him leroy
Copped some cheeb called it gold
Everybody got on, brash and bold
Got real sporty cracked another 40
(? 1:47) (? 1:48) cause jane she got naughty
Down on her knee's started to please
Here's another message for you other MC's

(Chorus)
Code money, he will amaze you!
Go off and go off and go crazy!
(Code Money scratches Chicago Gangsters - Gangster Boogie)

(Verse 3)
P for the power, S for the soul
K for the way I keep you on a roll
My age is full grown, the money i've blown
Don't want a super fly female, wealthy or old
Not in a cadillac cause I rap
Sit on down with your girl in my lap
Sitting in the lincoln stinking, thinking
Thunderbird homeboy you know I was drinking
I'll tell you a little story that's never been told
About the five two groups, so proud, so bold
Five MC's with mics in their hands
Rhyming disco lyn and glourious gram
Then came schoolly, the sure shot bet
Me and code been togethor since the day we met
Smoke a little cheeba and drink some wine
What's his is his, what's mine is mine

(Chorus/Outro)
Code money, he will amaze you!
Go off and go off and go crazy!
Rocking on til the break of dawn
Go off and go off and go on
(Code Money scratches Chicago Gangsters - Gangster Boogie)
