(The offical adventures of...)

[Hook]
PSK we're making that green
People always say, "What the hell does that mean?"
P for the people who can't understand
How one homeboy became a man
S for the way we scream and shout
One by one I'm knocking you out
K for the way my DJ cutting
Other MC's, man you ain't saying nothing
Rocking on to the break of dawn
I think Code Money, your time is on

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Driving in my car down the avenue
Towing on a j, sipping on some brew
Turned around, see the fly young lady
Pull to the curb and park my Mercedes
Said "Fly lady, now you're looking real nice
Sweeter than honey, sugar and spice"
Told her my name was MC Schoolly D
All about making that cash money
She said, "Schoolly D, I know your game
Heard about you in the hall of fame"
I said, "Mama, mama, I tell you no lies
Cause all I wanna do is to get you high
And uh - lay you down and do the body rock"
Took a walk to the corner, got into the car
Took a little trip to a fancy bar
Copped some brew, some j, some coke
Tell you now, brother, this ain't no joke
She got me to the crib, she laid me on the bed
I fucked her from my toes to the top of my head
I finally realized the girl was a whore
Gave her ten dollars, she asked me for some more

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Clinton Road one Saturday night
Towing on a cheeba I was feeling alright
Then my homie-homie called me on the phone
His name is Chief Keith, but we call him Bone
Told me 'bout this party on the Southside
Copped my pistol, jumped into the ride
Got at the bar, copped some flack
Copped some cheeba-cheeba, it wasn't wack
Got to the place, and who did I see
A sucker-ass nigga trying to sound like me
Put my pistol up against his head
And said, "You sucker-ass nigga I should shoot you dead"
A thought ran across my educated mind
Said, man, Schoolly D ain't doing no time
Grabbed the microphone and I started to talk
Sucker-ass nigga, man, he started to walk
