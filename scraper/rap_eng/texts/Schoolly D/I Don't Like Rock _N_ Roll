Yo yo, man, whassup, man?
Whassup man, you sayin' Prince? Say Prince?
It's Schoolly D., man, we rap!
Code Money man, so whassup man?
(Man, let them know what time it is.)

Microphone living is a thing of the past
And all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn
You fucked it all up when you let Michael in
I'd rather be a day in land of the dog
Then with some long haired tutti frutti running a mock
Because rock and roll is all illusion
Comes to no basic conclusion
Rap like jazz is not all fusion
DJ, 1200's you know he's using
I don't
I don't

Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours
Five two point size in my court of force
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight
Sippin' coqui 900, make me feel allright
Met my main man Ski, looking for a bike
Till I get on the mic, make everything right
Girl in my face, boy giving me static
Sat by my side, 38 automatic
B-boy stands, she lies on a beat
Hang downtown on a market street
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard
So all you long haired freaks better be on guard
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out
Because that is what rap's all about
I don't
I don't

Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"

Chillin' one day, I met a girl named Beaver
Took her on the Ave, conquered some cheever
Got real high as you will know
Thinking to myself while I rocked her so
Didn't like microphone, said she loved rap
So I told her: "Fly freak, sit upon my lap"
But I went too fast, gave me a slap
But I looked into her face, gave her this rap
When I rock a party, there is still a microphone
You can call me MC, you can call me on the phone
Came into the party, checked out my face
But you rock and roll lovers, get a girl in your face
Cause I came into the party with my sneakers on
Right microphones, all night long
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge
No other MC's got this kind of song
I don't
I don't

Def been mighty, rap all nighty
Chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi
We mean you ladi will have to party
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller
I get bad, watch her and bone her
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her
You left your girl, but you know I stole her
I don't
I don't

Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
Say it loud: "I love rap and I'm proud!"
