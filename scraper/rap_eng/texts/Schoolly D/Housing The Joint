One, two, three, hit me!

Turn up the microphone in my hand
I'm a brother of this land
You came to the party, see the look on your face
I'm standing on stage and I'm in your place
You say I tried to diss you and I stole your style
But the days you was rockin' I still a little child
What's up man, stop frontin'
What is, what ain't, ain't nuttin'
I'm rockin' to the break of dawn baby
Standing on stage might go a little crazy
Me and Cold Money just housing the joint
Yo, yo, yo what's up my man, did you get my point?

One, two, three, hit me!

Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself again [scratch and cut]

Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself again [scratch and cut]

One, two, three, hit me!

Way down on the ave, jumped into the ride
[?] need, you come inside
Walked through the door, dance on the floor
Five-two in the place it's gonna be war
Standin' on stage and ya beg for more
Gonna rap on the mic 'til my throat is sore
My man Cold Money got guts galore
Two years ago he wasn't [?] more
But nowadays we're down by law
Rockin' to the break of dawn baby
Standing on stage might go a little crazy
Me and Cold Money just housing the joint
Yo, yo, yo what's up homes, did you get my point?

Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself again [scratch and cut]

Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself again [scratch and cut]

One, two, three, hit me!

I'm on the radio, bet I'm playin'
Cash money at the door you payin'
Come inside the rhymes that I'm sayin'
Suckers in the back you know that I'm slayin'
No racism, it's just rhythm
People only dance to just what you give them
What I'm given, I am driven
To make you dance or make you listen
So girl don't give me respect
Because I got a gold chain around my neck
I'm not a toy, don't call me boy
You're in my way, you will be destroyed
I'm rockin' to the break of dawn baby
Standing on stage might go a little crazy
Me and Cold Money just housing the joint
Yo, yo, yo what's up homes, did you get my point?

One, two, three, hit me!

Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself again [scratch and cut]

Be myself again [scratch and cut]

One, two, three, hit me! [scratch and cut]

Thank you [scratch and cut]

Thank you, for lettin' me, be myself again [scratch and cut]

One, two, three, hit me! [scratch and cut]
