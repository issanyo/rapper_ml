"As we all know, you just can't believe everything you see and hear, can you?
Now if you'll excuse me, I must be on my way.."

[Schoolly D]
Don't call me nigga... WHITEY! (2X)
Don't call me nigga (nigga) WHITEY! (2X)

The whitey my man, you say you're my fan
I look into your face and I gots to say damn
I feel a lot of pain, the money you gain
Because I'm black you think it's come out of 'caine
I'll put you on a level, same as the devil
Stole my bass then you steal all my treble
Line to the eye, a bullet to the head
For all those lies, motherfucker you said
No you can't face this, so you disgrace it
I'm Schoolly School boy, and I will lace it

Don't call me nigga... WHITEY! (2X)
Don't call me nigga (nigga) WHITEY! (2X)

Now take that word nigga, and this is what I figure
A nigga, is ignorant, shiftless and lazy
So what you tryin to say boy, is that I'm crazy
Now I'm not a racist, or a fanatic
But what I'm bout to say might cause a little static
White America was raised on sanction
And to the black man, I'd like to mention
When I am Schoolin, on the microphone
Yo homes, leave the fuckin crack alone

Don't call me nigga... WHITEY! (2X)
Don't call me nigga (nigga) WHITEY! (2X)
