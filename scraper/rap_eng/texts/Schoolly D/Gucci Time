[Intro]
Yo yo, School, cuzin', what's up man? What's up with the record business?
Man, I think I'mma have to beat somebody up, man, they always be bitin' my shit man, y'know, man, just bitin', man
Man, I told you how them niggas are man, they ain't nothin' but squares
Oh, that's what they is

Yo Schoolly, what time is it?

[Chorus]
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme
I heard you was out there bitin' my lines
And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine
You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man
How the fuck didja get so cool, man
Never ever seen you play no fool"
Cuz I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and (x2)

[Verse 1]
MC Schoolly D, and Iâ€™m on the beatbox
I've never had a party that I didn't rock
And every baby girl thinks she's gettin' the world
I've never made a tune that wasn't too cool
Never been stopped next to T O P
For him to try to fuck with MC Schoolly D
2 Dolla bitches, they on my riches
Suckah MC's taken out with the dishes
Rhymes so delicious, raps so vicious
Buy me a wife to do my dishes
I keep ya in stitches
Ya hangin in kitches
No itch, no ash, no crust, no bitches
I eat sandwiches
My best friend bitches
Based on fact, not based fictitious

[Chorus]
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme
I heard you was out there bitin' my lines
And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine
You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man
How the fuck didja get so cool, man
Never ever seen you play no fool"
Cuz I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and (x2)

[Verse 2]
F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Tarzan and Jane does it in tree
Adam and Eve, birds and the bees
Everybody do it but the suckah MC's
Roxanne did it to UTFO
About a sucka nigga down callin' a ho
I say baby doll, can ya meet me in the black?
We do it from the front, and we do it from the back
But don't, don't do it, cuz niggas are sly
They ain't got no job, they be down with the mob
And the only thing you'll doin'
But the only thing you'll get is burn, baby burn

[Chorus]
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme
I heard you was out there bitin' my lines
And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine
You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man
How the fuck didja get so cool, man
Never ever seen you play no fool"
Cuz I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and (x2)

[Verse 3]
Baa baa black sheep was a little whore
Can't run hack cuz she gave herself some more
Give her a dollar, to make her scream and holler
Put my head under the bar and she made me wanna call
Reachin' in my pocket, and pulled out my gun
Shot her pimp in the head, motherfuckah fell dead
But now she's in jail with a ten year bail

(Scratching: That's- That's- That's- That's Fresh! )

[Chorus]
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme
I heard you was out there bitin' my lines
And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine
You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man
How the fuck didja get so cool, man
Never ever seen you play no fool"
Cuz I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and (x2)
