(Intro)
White man (7x)
This record were about to embark on
Might offend some other white junkies but...
If you are righteous weather you are black yellow or white
You will know what im about to say is right
If you are down with the clan you must understand
That where gonna stand up and fight you

My brother man

White man
Will always get paid
White man

(Verse 1)
Black is beautiful , brown is hip
Yellows okay but white ain't shit
Man I'm not a racist or a fanatic
See me on the Ave chillin with my automatic
My name's Schoolly School - im in your neighborhood
Though my color is brown - im up to no good
Look at that nigga
Wants to pull a trigger
To high on caine
That's what I figure
Come here honey tell you something funny
We make the raps and they make the money
Keep us uneducated and dumb in the brain
The same white bitch got you strung out on caine

White man

If you ever feel like this

(Verse 2)
Man Fuck school, school is getting sleazier
Fuck work, my work is getting measier
Fuck life, I'm tired of getting pleasier
I rather sell drugs, selling drugs is easier
Standin'on the corner selling cadges of crack
Telling all these little kids to step the fuck back
Sneakers ran over, you hear all nighty
Only thing you care about is beat me up scotty
Yes slick, I'm giving my dick
Don't come here causing some/and? Pain
Cause you's the same white bitch that got me strung out on kane
White man
Yo babe check this shit out
Fuck the TV, the sender is wrong (?)
To say cheebah cheebah in a Schoolly D song
They think I'm uneducated and some of the brain
That same white bich got me strung out on kane
