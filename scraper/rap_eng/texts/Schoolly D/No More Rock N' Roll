(Intro)
Yo man, yo, yo
Fuck Cinderella, fuck Bon Jovi and motherfuck Prince, man
This is rap
We've got something for all of them to wrap their lips around
We've got something
Yeah, check this shit out

(Chorus)
No more rock N roll!
No more fucking rock N roll!
No more rock N roll!
No more fucking rock N roll!
No more rock N roll!
No more fucking rock N roll!
No more rock N roll!
No more fucking rock N roll!

(Verse 1)
That's right y'all
I'm a hell of a man
I walk down the street and I heard you say damn
I wanna be like Schoolly too
I make rap records and I say fuck you
Still homeboy I get respect
You can tell by the gold chain around my neck
You know I never ever, ever did get robbed
Homeboys think I'm down with the mob
Because I carry a gun by my side
Always got fly cutie in my ride
Sometimes oh yes I do get high
See, now I came here to do this jive
On the microphone I want rap
Rock and rollers step fuck back

(Chorus)
No more rock N roll!
No more fucking rock N roll!
No more rock N roll!
No more fucking rock N roll!

(Verse 2)
Long haired freak get back on your bus
Me and Code Money we're comming to rush
Rock N Rollers, we've taking over
Stand on stage, I pimp and strolla
You faggots get out of my face
I punch you out man, oh what a disgrace
My name's Schoolly D on the microphone

(Chorus)
No more rock N roll!
No more fucking rock N roll!
No more rock N roll!
No more fucking rock N roll!
