Yeah, lemme tell ya little tale bout my neighbor
Young motherfucker, he wanna pull a caper
Call his homies on the telephone
Getcha shit, load the fucker, cause you know its on
I'm gettin high off the indo
Meet me at 9 in back of the Sunoco
I gotta pull a car, he jackin
And don't give a fuck if that nigga white or black and
Ain't no use in ya bitchin
Niggas don't care if they putcha in a ditch and
Fuck it cause he shot ya
All he know is that a young nigga got cha
Because you shoulda came gatted
You didn't know that the young nigga had it
I guess you had to learn ya lesson
Young niggas will always keep ya guessin

"Oh, yo G there that bitch go"
"Where where?" "Yo get the fuckin car"
"I got this shit come on"
"Bitch get out the fuckin car"
[Jumbled talking]
"Fuck me? Naw fuck you bitch"
[gun shots]
"Uh, uh, somebody help me, uh, somebody help me please"

How could she know she was a goner
The young thang, she lived around the corner
But the niggas didn't give a fuck
All they knew is tonight they gotta make a buck
Cause you go to rob a K-Mart
Young niggas, they like to play the rough part
And you know they never stop it
Young niggas who love to stay clockin
Even though they have no future
Didn't give a fuck if a nigga had ta shoot cha
And it was anticipated
Inside where the 5 all had waited
As he walked into the front door
All ya heard was nigga hit the floor
So that nigga started cappin
Droppin motherfuckers like a droppin in his yappin
I guess he had to learn his lesson
Young motherfuckers, you can't keep guessin

"Freeze nigga, put your gun on the ground"
"Hey man, put yourself the fuck up!"
[Gun shots]
"LIGHT THIS BITCH UP"
"BUST THAT MOTHAFUCKA!"
"Give it up, give it up!"
"Watch ya back, watcha ya back!"
"Awww SHIT! I'm hit!"
"Man fuck this, I'm audi"
"Yo, yo, come her man, fuck it man
You bitch ass nigga, yo!! I'm hit, man fuck that
Nigga, motherfucker left, motherfucker"

Yo, stop frontin and use ya head

Yo, stop frontin and use ya head
Yo, stop frontin and use ya head
