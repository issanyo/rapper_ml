(Intro)
1, 2, 3, 4

(Verse 1)
We don't rock we rap
It's like that
You thought it was gone
But now I'm back
Standin on stage in a hell of a rage
Take rock N rollers put you back in your cave
I don't like rock N roll I never did
Didn't even like when I was a little kid
You's a longhaired freak
Seven days a week
Making money in leather
I make money in sneaks
I don't like rock N roll cause rock is rambling
Rather hear rap cause rock is handling
Long haired suckers get out of my face
Cause me and Code Money running the place
We RAP!
We don't rock we rap

1,2 3, 4 (4x)

(Verse 2)
You is capastetic
You know you can bet it
I take you rock N rollers man you never get wet it
Code cut the records down to the bone
I'm an MC that rock the microphone
For your information, in this nation
It's all about that rap creation
Another motivation, domination
I'll be ill as innovation
It's a killer, no it's a thriller
Yo Code how about a miller
We don't rock we rap
