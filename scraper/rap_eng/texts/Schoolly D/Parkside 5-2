Early in the mornin' jumped out my bed
Blast some Afro-Sheen and I combed my head
[?] some Ultrabrite and I brushed my teeth
Grabbed some Perry Ellis and I washed my feet
Slipped down the banister like I was insane
Grabbed my Gucci watch and my fly gold chain
Opened up the door and I ran outside
Laced me some cheeba, jumped into my ride
Drove to the corner, see my homeboy Lynn
Cruisin' 'round the corner to the Parkside Inn
Jumped out the car, ran into the bar
'Bout 6 or 7 steps because it wasn't too far
Got inside, copped a 40 of brew
"Yo, Schoolly-School man what you gonna do?"
Looked all around, met me a girlie
A big fat booty and a fly Jheri-curli
Asked her could she do me and she said it's too early
"What that bitch name?" Bitch name was Shirley
Didn't mean to diss her, how was I supposed to know?
With that big fat booty I thought she was a ho

Parkside, my place and home
There be escaped gangsters, like Jerome
Cheeba in the hand, 32 in the socks
Protectin' our turf like it was Fort Knox

'Cause it's Parkside 5, 5-2

Been pretty in the [?] from way, way back
Lynn and Ryan taught me how to rap
Cool came along and he wanted to scratch
And now we're tellin' everybody step the hell back
When I went to school I didn't learn too much
Chased a lotta girls, smoked cheeba and such
A little white kid called me a nigga
If I had gun then I'da pulled that trigger
Pullin' out guns, stickin' up in faces
It ain't just me, it's all creeds and races
On the corner sellin' weed is my friend Mike
I can't say that it's wrong or that it's right
