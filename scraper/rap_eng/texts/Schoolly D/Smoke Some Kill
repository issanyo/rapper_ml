Cheeba, cheeba on my brain
Went downtown jump the train
12 o’clock in New York
No cab, had to walk
Downtown Latin Quarter
Got inside drunk some water
Stepped on stage started to talk
Said yo yo what up New York

Danced all around act so silly
Homie in the crowd said must be from Philly
Code was cuttin’ I was grabbing my dick
Thought to my self I'm tired as shit
Jump off stage ran outside
Grab Code Money jumped a ride
Turn left no homie turn right
Straight back to the after midnight

Got to the place people was cheering
Girls threw panties that they was wearing
Fellas in the back they was leering
My fat gold chain they was staring
I wasn't caring you faggots
I ain't fearing
Calm down cool and chill
Crack another forty smoke some kill

Woke up early Sunday morn
Jump out of bed Fila's on
Thought about the hangover
Kissed the dog called my mom Rover
Went to the kitchen Cap’n Crunch
Turn on the tube the Brady Bunch
Instead of a house they live in a palace
Jan was fucking Mike and Mike was fucking Alice

My little eyes opened up wide
The thing in my pants started to rise
Sat down on the couch to cool and chill
Crack me a forty roll some kill
I was smoking I was toking
My mom said boy you must be joking
Threw me outside it was raining I was soaking
That weed so damn provoking

Yeah!! So I crack another forty
Smoke some kill
Thought to my self
My mom got ill

Yeah
Wait 'til she get my bill
