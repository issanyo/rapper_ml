[Intro]
2-1, 2-1, 2, in the place to be
DJ Code Money on the wheels of steel
My name happens to be MC Schoolly D
We're gonna do somethin' freestyle for y'all
And it go like this

[Verse 1]
2-1, 2-1, 2-1, 2
Sucka ass niggas your time is through
Rockin' everybody, 'cause you know that I can
Shockin' everybody, I'm a hell of a man
Rockin' everybody, walkin' down the street
Shockin' everybody, 'cause it sounds so neat
First name's Schoolly, and my last name's D
Got all the fly people hangin' at my feet
Sucka ass niggas, in the place
Don't even know why, you're showin' your face
Rockin' everybody, 'cause I know that I can
Shockin' everybody, I'm a hell of a man
Rockin' by my side, is MC Pimp
Chillin' in the back, with a hell of a limp
DJ Code, on the two turntables
Shockin' everybody, 'cause he's willing and able

[Verse 2]
2-1, 2-1, 2-1, 2
Sucka ass niggas, your time is through
2 dollar bitches, get off of my back
You'll never take a ride in my Cadillac
'Cause why you stinkin', we just thinkin'
We pulled up in a blue cold Lincoln
Sucka ass niggas, in the place
We don't even know why, you're showin' your face
While my DJ makin' you dance
Chillin' in the back with a B-Boy stance

[Verse 3]
2-1, 2-1, 2-1, 2
Sucka ass niggas, your time is through
Sittin' one day, out and chillin' a while
Watchin' re-runs of Gilligan's Isle
Just one thing I'd like to know
Is that bitch Ginger a hoe
Saw her beach, so far out, shit
Suckin' off the vessel's dick
Did she got with Mr. Howell
Got with the Skipper for a long long while
If there is no circumstance
My DJ will make you dance
Call him Code or call him Lance
But i'm in the back with the B-Boy stance

2-1, 2-1, 2-1, 2
Sucka ass niggas, your time is through

[Verse 4]
2-1, 2-1, 2-1, 2
Sucka ass niggas, your time is through
Stop illin', while i'm chillin'
Came here tonight to do some MC killin'
Rhymes so def, they reach the ceilin'
I know you're gettin high, but i'm not drug dealin'
The beat from the drum machine you're feelin'
I know you're gettin' ready, waitin' and illin'
Just wait a little longer 'cause i'm still chill chillin'
If there is no circumstance
My DJ will make you dance
Call him Code or call him lance
But i'm in the back with the B-Boy stance

[Verse 5]
2-1, 2-1, 2-1, 2
Sucka ass niggas, your time is through
The only reason why, you on my tip
Is because I make a lot of money, you dollar bitch
I need a fly girl that's so so pretty
Chillin' out hard in the big big city
Don't smoke no cheeba, don't do no coke
Don't need a fly girl strung out on dope
What I need is a fly girl full of romance
Your more favorite doll ,nothin' but a chance
Why my DJ make you dance
I'm in the back in the B-Boy stance
