Lying alone doesnâ??t seem to be such a great idea as when you where here
I keep telling myself the grass isnâ??t greener on the other side, still I know itâ??s a lie
Itâ??s a lie, but it bides my time

Pussycat I hate you
Pussycat I love you
And Iâ??m never ever going to regret this
No Iâ??ll just cherish those sweet moments you made me cry

Stuck between two kinds of love isnâ??t half as fun as it seemed to be
But stuck is just what I am and for once I just want to be free. Free, not like you and me

Pussycat I hate you
And pussycat I love you
And Iâ??m never ever going to regret this
No Iâ??ll just cherish those sweet moments you made me cry

Now even running away is what I have to run from
Cause when I drink, I drink until I fall and then I drink more
So whatâ??s left to do now? I guess keep running
Iâ??ll stumble; Iâ??ll fall, until I hit the wall

Pussycat I hate you
And pussycat I love you
And Iâ??m never ever going to regret this
No Iâ??ll just cherish those sweet moments you made me cry
