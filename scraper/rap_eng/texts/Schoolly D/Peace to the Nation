I seen a brother kill another brother
Then I heard the brother say "Word to the mother"
Thought to myself: is this insane
Or this just another bullshit game?
Keep playin and if I keep groovin
What that muthafucka Schoolly D provin?
That I'm a blackman you misunderstand
So what you're sayin? (Word to the motherland)
And the reality for me and you
What that muthafucka think you think that we can do
To give

So what you're sayin, so what you're doin?
What that muthafucka think you think that you're pursuin
Money and fame in this bullshit game for life
Stabbed in the back by my own brother's knife
I keep strivin, dip-dip-divin
While the others keep killin and robbin
And stealin and petty drug-dealin
Fuckin up bitches, that's how I'm feelin
The reality for me and you
What that muthafucka think you think that we can do
To get

The three top-sellin black products
Is gold, hoes and any narcotic
Let me tell you a little somethin 'bout knowledge
How many black muthafuckas go to college?
In my mind there's a light like a lantern
I can see there's a muthafuckin pattern
The brothers on the street just tryin
Is the same muthafucka that's dyin
And the reality for me and you
What that muthafucka think you think that we can do
To give
