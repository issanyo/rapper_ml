(Verse 1)
Standing on the corner at quarter past nine
Me and code money sipping thunderbird wine
Met up with a bitch and her name was Suzy
Some say say a floozie, I say a doozie
Told me and code about a gang bang party
Said "Be early don't be tardy, if you be late your gonna be sorry"
2 seconds later I popped a harley

(Verse 2)
Still standing on the corner at a quarter past 10
Met up with this bitch and her name was Jin
Rumour has it she'll take 10 men, not for the dollars for the yen
I said "Um, excuse me baby sorry how about a little game of tardy?"
Said she could she was late for a party
2 seconds later code popped a harley

(Verse 3)
Back to the part at a quarter of eleven
Me and code money in big booty heaven
Drawls came down just that easy
Just that thick and just that sleasy
Code got down with a girl name trudy, yeah holmes real big booty
I got through with a girl name sally god damn, made my rally
Up came manny, the came marty few seconds later they popped a harley
