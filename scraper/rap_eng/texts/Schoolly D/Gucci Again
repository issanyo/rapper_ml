(Intro)
Yo wassup man it's TLA back on the set again
I don't know if ya'll heard about it or not, but schoolly d is back with another one of them block rocking beats
Bust it!

(Verse 1)
From the hip-hop tip, 900 I sip
Going off flowing on and then I trip
I was born and raised to my amaze
A super star who you now gaze
So understand i'm just a man, who paid his dues now you're my fan
Looking at my gucci
One more time, time, time, time to hit another funky rhyme
Yes, i cause static the beat is automatic
Skinny, brown not white
So you know I (? 1:08)
All like the smiths fucking up a bitch
Looking like a skeezer living in a ditch

(Chorus)
Looking at my gucci
One more time, time, time, time to hit another funky rhyme
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci

(Verse 2)
You play me out like a game, cause a lot of pain
Me and cold money it's all just the same
Willing and able with the fat cable
Code Money, Code Money on the turntable
No, i'm bad and bold my dick I will hold
The beat you wouldn't hear if the record wasn't sold
Rhymes so powerful, know I got a tower full
Sit on down, you know you'll get an hour full
Looking at my gucci
One more time, time, time, time to hit another funky rhyme
Moving like a motor
I drink a lot of soda
I'm looking like billy, bitch you looking like yoda
You wear a lot of gold, you got a fancy car
You're still a sucka and school is just a star
You're acting like school you motherfucking fool
I ain't looking rougher and you are still a tool
So your in a gang, a posse, a group
And when you're in trouble you yell "Yo troop"
But schoolly is a man and boy you ain't shit
Your mothers in the back and she's sucking on my dick


(Chorus)
Looking at my gucci
One more time, time, time, time to hit another funky rhyme
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci
Looking at my gucci it's about that time
