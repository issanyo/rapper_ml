[Bridge]
Got me doing all the things I said I wouldn’t do
And all my other girls be looking like who the fuck is you
Jealous on the time we’ve been standing
Cause they don’t hold my interest, I can’t help it

[Hook]
I fucks with you, I fucks with you
I fucks with you, I fucks with you
I fucks with you, girl I fucks with you

[Verse 1]
You got me strong girl, keep me coming back
Oh you’re my fun girl, we be kicking back
You’re like my homie, except you’re fine as hell
Except you’re fine as hell, Mama cooking these well
You got that whole cake, so I blow you out
We spend the whole day, we might never leave this house
You’d be tripping on these chickens
Trying to get all up in our business
You keep it tight, I salute you
That body right, I applaud you

[Verse 2]
When it’s you and it’s me we don’t got nobody to impress
Just sex, no stress, can’t say the same about my ex
When I call, you pick up your phone
When I call you know it’s time to go
I ain’t gotta say, you already know, you already know to keep me on the roll
You got a girl crush on Cassie, uh you so nasty
It’s okay I like it, that shit get me excited
Bitch you so crazy and don’t take that personal
Cause you know you’re my baby

[Outro]
You got me strong, girl
Oh, you’re my fun girl
You’re like my homie
Except you’re fine as hell
Except you’re fine as hell
