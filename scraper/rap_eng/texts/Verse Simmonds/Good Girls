[Intro]
Good girls just wanna have fun
Need a drink, I'mma pour another up
Need a man, I'mma be what ya want
London On Da Track

[Chorus]
Good girls just wanna have fun
Party all night 'til the sun comes up
And if you need a drink, I'mma pour another one
Baby, all night, we gon' get fucked up

There's some girls in this club that wanna have fun
It's gonna be a long night, baby, show me what it feels like

We gon' be going all night, baby, do it if it feels right

Oh, in case you didn't know
