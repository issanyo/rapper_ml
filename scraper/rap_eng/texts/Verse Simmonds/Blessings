[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yah, yah, yah
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Swear the sun shinin' on me in my huddle
No matter the trouble surroundin' us
They don't see that it's a lot of us
Everybody move anonymous
Won't take that credit, I know where we get it
Them blessings be comin' from God above
I was doin' all kinda bad
Where the choir at? Tell 'em I need a verse
Hit the pew and tell God He's first
Hit the studio to body a verse
I remember pushin' mama's little white Hyundai with no gas money
I just bought a car, cash money
I ain't even tryna brag on it
I just tell it how it really is
I ain't trippin', they ain't feelin' this
I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'
I'm just tryna talk about the benefits
I've been punchin' in the clock
Tryna keep the kitchen stocked
Man it's a blessin' 'cause we ain't ever had a lot
But all we need is all we got

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

[Post-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I put my mama in the crib, said, "Stop stressin'"
I put my girl in a brand new diamond necklace
She said she need more of my love and affection
'Cause lately I've been workin' harder than ever
She said, "Baby, you a boss, baby, clear your schedule
Dolla you a boss, let's do somethin' special
Take me on a PJ, we should go to Mexico
I've been down for you boy, since when the money was low"
Anything for my bae 'cause she a blessing
If you woke up this morning it's a blessing

[Post-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I took so many losses
Coulda lost it
Left 'em leaky like a faucet
Almost cost me
Everything that I got, all of my fam
Part of the plan
I was eatin' fried bologna out of the pan
Y'all don't understand
I was tryna get it
I'm in that studio tryna keep it pushin'
Patty pies, boy I kept 'em cookin'
All I needed was the Mary Mary
But the God in me was havin' commentary, woo!
I got angels all around like Anita Baker
Blessings fallin' in line, guess I need a taper
And every loss is a lesson
Tell my haters I confess
Treat 'em like the green bubbles on the iPhone
I probably never read the message

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson

Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
