[Chorus]
Last night I mixed Patron with the Henney
Last night I said some things that I shouldn't
Last night I took it too far and you took it all wrong
Liquor and misunderstanding

[Verse 1]
Baby I went too hard
Baby I went too far
Why you gotta be such a wild card
I can never predict what you're on
Simple conversations turn to interrogation
Now we fucking up the room out in Vegas
Say whatever just to get in your feelings
Tell the security to mind their business
And no that nigga ain't me
You know that nigga ain't fly though
You must be sipping out the bottle
Its getting hard to see the difference between you and these models
Guess that's where it all went wrong
Saying things we can never take back
In a glass house throwing stones

[Chorus]
Last night I mixed Patron with the Henney
Last night I said some things that I shouldn't
Last night I took it too far and you took it all wrong
Liquor and misunderstanding
Last night I mixed Patron with the Henney
Last night I said some things that I shouldn't
Last night I took it too far and you took it all wrong
Liquor and misunderstanding

[Verse 2]
I guess that liquor and feelings don't mix
I know that I'm out of line when you get me to calling you bitch
I know my mama ain't raised me to talk to no woman like this
How do you get the worst out of me
You know I could never be proud of that
But fuck it ain't no really going back
To the way things used to
I ain't never been what you used to
All the bullshit that you do
Its going to make me find a new you
Guess that's where it all went wrong
Saying things we can never take back
In a glass house throwing stones

[Chorus]
Last night I mixed Patron with the Henney
Last night I said some things that I shouldn't
Last night I took it too far and you took it all wrong
Liquor and misunderstanding
Last night I mixed Patron with the Henney
Last night I said some things that I shouldn't
Last night I took it too far and you took it all wrong
Liquor and misunderstanding

[Outro]
In a glass house throwing stones
You know that nigga ain't me
Saying things we can never take back
