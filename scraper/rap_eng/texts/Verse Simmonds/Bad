[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]

You say you never made love
Well now's the time to make up
I know they never gave a fuck
As long as you would give it up
I don't wanna' judge you
Just give me the real you
You know I would never kiss and tell
I see so much more than sex appeal

They don't see what I see they don't have to agree
They don't have to believe just as long you're happy
No, they don't see what I see what I see
All the pain you've been through all the love that's in you
All the things that makes you, you
I accept ya' baby
Because your beautiful don't you let nobody tell you different baby
And no matter what I just wanna be the one to always catch you baby
Never forget ya' baby
When I undress you baby
We'll make love for the very first time

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]

Is it bad that I never made love
No I never did it but I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, No not having it but at least I can admit that I'll be bad nooooo--- to you
Yea I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to ya
