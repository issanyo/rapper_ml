[Verse 1]
I bet you never walk by without a nigga tryna holla
Talkin' that, baby, what's your number? Can I call ya?
Talkin' that, if you want mine, don't worry 'bout a thing
I could get you anything you ever wanted
I put you on so you never entertain that shit
These niggas just sound basic
You need a man you can relate with
Somebody you can share faith with

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at how they look at you
Even bitches tryna get at you
Niggas with the latest tryna pick at you
Every other man tryna grab it
And I don't know how you do it
I don't know how you do it
But if it's one thing I know for sure
Baby, you are

[Chorus]
You're a hard act to follow
I love to see you walk away, I hate to see you go
You're a hard act to follow
You're one in a million, I wonder if you know
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
You're a hard act to follow
Love you see you walk away, I hate to see you go

[Verse 2]
Pose for the camera, you look good and you did it for you
You might need a photographer, and make sure that we get every view
Blessed and you know it's true, sometimes it must feel like a curse
Bein' someone so beautiful, sometimes it must feel like it's work
Beauty is a currency, get your money, get your money
Get your money, get your money, it might take you all night
Just to count it all up, get your money, get your money
All of them hate, let 'em hate, let 'em hate, let a broke bitch hate, let a broke bitch hate

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at how they look at you
Even bitches tryna get at you
Niggas with the latest tryna pick at you
Every other man tryna grab it
And I don't know how you do it
I don't know how you do it
But if it's one thing I know for sure
Baby, you are

[Chorus]
You're a hard act to follow
I love to see you walk away, I hate to see you go
You're a hard act to follow
You're one in a million, I wonder if you know
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
You're a hard act to follow
Love you see you walk away, I hate to see you go

[Bridge]
You left your imprint on my mind, how you slow down
I want this moment to last forever
I won't waste my time, I know I won't find
Nobody like you, not ever

[Chorus]
You're a hard act to follow
I love to see you walk away, I hate to see you go
You're a hard act to follow
You're one in a million, I wonder if you know
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
They ain't ready for ya
You're a hard act to follow
Love you see you walk away, I hate to see you go
