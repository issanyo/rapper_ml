[Intro: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Mmm, wait
Oh no, yeah

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
My intuition says you're a real one
I got my hopes up, lose some, you win some, yeah
Peace, love and wisdom, yeah, yeah
'Cause anytime now, you might miss your chance
You might miss your chance

[Verse 1: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Once and for all, you're such a star
You just left and I miss you
Like Bone Thugs miss some good Charles, yeah
We going, we going way up
You FaceTime with no makeup
Yeah, we all get that confidence
I like how you're hard to get
No ex wants to parts of this
Can't call it quits and you started it, yeah
You say you get what you want
But I got what you need
So vibe with me

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
My intuition says you're a real one
I got my hopes up, lose some, you win some, yeah
Peace, love and wisdom, yeah, yeah
'Cause anytime now, you might miss your chance
You might miss your chance

[Post-Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I, I, I want you
To realize what I can do
Say I, I, I
My intuition says you're a real one

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
You a real one and I'm a realist
I know we ain't 'posed to share no feelings
I done fucked with all these girls, I ain't feeling it
I ain't never had nobody I can be with
I got issues, fucking issues
But you know that from the start, girl, I'm a handful
I been looking for the right one to give my name to
Waitng for the right time to tell you it's you, yeah
'Cause you a vibe like the music in the 90's
Sitting on the hood, smoking 'til our eyes Chinese
Listening to Jodeci, oh, we listening to Syi Ari, yeah

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid & Verse Simmonds]
My intuition says you're a real one
I got my hopes up, lose some, you win some, yeah
Peace, love and wisdom, yeah, yeah
'Cause anytime now, you might miss your chance
You might miss your chance

[Post-Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I, I, I want you
To realize what I can do
Say I, I, I
My intuition says you're a real one

[Outro: Sy Ari Da Kid]
My intuition, say I, I, I
My intuition, say I, I, I
My intuition
My intuition
