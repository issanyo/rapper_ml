[Intro: Verse Simmonds aka VVS] (x4)

Ah yeah (ah yeah)
Ah yeah (ah yeah)
Ahhhhh yeaaaahhhh

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]

Sex is an art tell me baby can I paint your body with love (yeah yeah)
Imagination runnin' wild when I'm think 'bout what I'm trynna do to ya girl
I'm creative baby won't do the same thing twice nah nah nah
Lady you could be my latest attraction

[Pre-Chorus: VVS]

Come get some of that long stroke
Welcome to the art show
I'ma put it on slow
Gotta get it right
Baby you're a one-of-one
You're my favorite one
In the years to come, you'll still be perfection

[Chorus: VVS]

You'll be my Mona Lisa
They don't do it like you (nah)
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it ...
You'll be my Mona Lisa
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it like you (nah)
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it ...
They don't do it ...
Cause you're priceless
You're priceless
You're priceless
You're priceless

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Look, girl I can't get enough of your frame gotta know it's priceless
No matter how long we been in this ring, I just know you can't fight it
I just want to put you on the wall, nail it in cause I know it's mine
I ain't really good with attitudes
I want you like good food, hurry up we ain't got much time
[?], like a damn [?]
Long black hair look just like Mulan
You looking at a star baby girl lets shine
I put you in the game, take you off the sideline, yeah
Draw this shit like Picasso
She gone ride like a Tahoe
My life just like a movie baby
These bitches just want a cameo
Paint the picture, MichaelAngelo
I can't stand no messy hoe
But if your man actin' up
Girl don't mind you can ...

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

I said sex is an art tell me baby can I paint your body with love (yeah yeah)
I'm the artist, your body is my canvas I just wanna touch
Picasso ain't got nothin' on me when it's 'bout my lady
We up in this gallery getting so faded
Baby all night I'll be focused on you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus/Outro]

You'll be my Mona Lisa
They don't do it like you (nah)
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it ...
You'll be my Mona Lisa
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it like you (nah)
Ain't another like you (nah)
They don't do it ...
They don't do it ...
Cause you're priceless (you're my girl)
You're priceless (wouldn't trade you for all of the money in the world)
You're priceless (baby you are)
You're priceless (ooooooh)
