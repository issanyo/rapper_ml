[Verse 1]:
Chills going up your spine
Sweat coming down your back
Love it when you're biting your lip
Tell me aren't you loving this shit
Hold on, baby, hold on tight
I just wanna make you feel alright
See you're getting all emotional
Baby, that's what it's supposed to do

[Chorus]:
Don't it feel so good, na na na na
Baby, once the rain starts falling down
Drip, dripping wet, baby, let it come down
Drip, dripping wet, baby, let it come down
Your tears of joy, tears of joy
Tears of joy, tears of joy
Running down your face
Running down your face

[Verse 2]:
We keep losing track of our time
Riding to the top of cloud 9
Kissing every inch of your skin
Knock, knocking, baby let me in
Oh no, the neighbors won't sleep tonight
And your body's telling me what I like to hear
See you're getting all emotional
Baby, that's what it's supposed to do

[Chorus]:
Don't it feel so good, na na na na
Baby, once the rain starts falling down
Drip, dripping wet, baby, let it come down
Drip, dripping wet, baby, let it come down
Your tears of joy, tears of joy
Tears of joy, tears of joy
Running down your face
Running down your face
Don't it feel so good, na na na na
Baby, once the rain starts falling down
Drip, dripping wet, baby, let it come down
Drip, dripping wet, baby, let it come down, down, down
