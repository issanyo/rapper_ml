[Verse 1]
Say you got a new man, new man, new man, whatever the fuck
I don't give a damn cause you still gon', still gon' let a nigga fuck
Told you before that pussy still mine
She said say it again so she know I ain't lyin'

[Pre-Chorus]
She know what it is when I come to the city
We ain't gotta have windows down cause you see me
She put on that little, tight dress that I like
And tonight she doin' everything that I like, yeah we gotta fuck everything

[Chorus]
I'll always belong to you
You'll always belong to me
There's nothing I wouldn't do
This love is a guarantee
I'll always belong to you
You'll always belong to me
There's nothing I wouldn't do
This love is a guarantee

[Verse 2]
Mine, mine, mine, it's been a long time, no, not much's changed
We picked up where we left off like we never missed a day
Okay, got you open, got you smokin'
Doin' things that you never do with him, you never do with him

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause she know what it is when I come to the city
(She know what it is when I come to the city)
She gon' turn her cellphone off when she with me
(She gon' turn her cellphone off when she with me)
She gon' do the little, freaky things that I like
And she ain't gon' make it back home, not tonight
Not tonight

[Chorus]
I'll always belong to you
You'll always belong to me
There's nothing I wouldn't do
This love is a guarantee
I'll always belong to you
You'll always belong to me
There's nothing I wouldn't do
This love is a guarantee
I'll always belong to you
You'll always belong to me
There's nothing I wouldn't do
This love is a guarantee
I'll always belong to you
You'll always belong to me
There's nothing I wouldn't do
This love is a guarantee
