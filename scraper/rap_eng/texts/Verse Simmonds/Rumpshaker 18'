Go ahead drop snake up from the waist
Let me see that rumpshaker money make
Stir it round like a thick girl milk shake
Hundred dolla bill turn that pussy to a lake
Don’t know if I’m happy or the gun on my waist
Let me see that rumpshaker money make
Slim face but u thick girl milk shake
Throw it to the air push it down from the face
Let me see that rumpshaker

[Verse 1 : Verse Simmonds]

Woah issa date

Pick her up lately I️ been liftin weights 
Shawty choosing you on a chicken chase
Bucket after bucket get a hundred if she lucky

Baby rock that boat know I’m mean with the row

Henny stream with the flow
Know I’m ready for the show just
