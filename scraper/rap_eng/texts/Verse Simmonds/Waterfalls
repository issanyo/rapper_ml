[Chorus]
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Feels like waterfalls, waterfalls, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can feel you always round me
Girl, you know I want you on me
Private island, swimmin' in your sea
Wanna rock the boat, baby
The water runnin' from your fountain
She lets me know that it's time to begin
Cause when I'm in, it's sink or swim
Comin' down

[Chorus]
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Feels like waterfalls, just like waterfalls, yeah
No more playin', gonna lay in it, stay in it
Comin' down if you with it, I'm with it
Feels like waterfalls, just like waterfalls, yeah

[Bridge]
Divin' in your skin
Drippin' down your spine
Put it on my tongue
This is what you call love
Divin' in your skin
Drippin' down your spine
Put it on my tongue
This is what you call love

[Chorus]
Comin' down, comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down
There's nothin' that I won't do for ya
Comin' down, comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down
Waterfalls, comin' down
