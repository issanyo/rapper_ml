I hope you're not trying to mislead me, Miss Johnson

Verse Simmonds Verse 1:
Laying in the bed she getting ready in the bathroom
Baby got a perfect figure like a cartoon
Call her Betty Boop, two big ol' boobs
I like sucking on her lips like a cup of juice
Playing on the mirror, asking what I'm looking at
She got sexy panties on and got hella ass
I can handle that
She like it when I say it, never mind how I tell it, I can sing or rap
You look so good, you look so fine
That I wanna work that, work that, all through the night

[Hook]

Verse Simmonds Verse 2:
Red lace catsuit with the thong back
She put it on and she let me take that
Take that
Take that
When she cum she do the Harlem shake dance
Pussy good, make a nigga wanna break dance
Never thinking marriage, now a nigga wanna make plans
Uhhh, yea you do that baby
If there ever was a one, then you that lady
Or I'm that crazy for that straight-jacket loving
Rise like dough when I'm inside of your oven
I hope this never change
And your feelings stay the same
I really dig your body but I'm in love with your brain

[Hook]

Verse Simmonds Verse 3:
It seems love don't love me anymore
And new pussy keep knocking at my door
And she never in the mood like she used to
Maybe she done fucked around and got a new boo
Now she acting brand new like a knew she would
Things never last when it seem so good
And every time I ask, she say it's all good
I want to let her go I don't think I could
I don't think I could
I want to let her go I don't think I could
And every time I ask, she say it's all good
I want to let her go I don't think I, could

[Hook]

We too grown for those type of games
Come get with some winners
