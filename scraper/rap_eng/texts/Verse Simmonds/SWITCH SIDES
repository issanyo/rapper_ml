[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Yeah, aye
Got the realest with me
Rollin' through the city
I can't roll with y'all boys
Y'all be too mixed
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
Get the cash, get a chain, they the only thing changed
They go crazy for the fame
I think that's a small thing
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Them gorillas, they the realest, they been with us since day one
Hittas in my family since I 'member they don't play, huh
When I come around them haters they don't say nothin'
See theses suckers far away, bruh, they stay bluffin'
Ha!
Dame with the whole front
I'm the captain of the ship
I've been seein' how y'all front
Better if you get up, against you, it's a swish
See 'em lurkin' 'cause I'm rich
But if y'all try, try to get a dish
I'ma keep ridin', ride with one whip
We ain't finna switch, we gon' keep it lit

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Got the realest with me
Rollin' through the city
I can't roll with y'all boys
Y'all be too mixed
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
Pay the cash, get a chain, they the only thing changed
They go crazy for the fame
I think that's a small thing
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)

[Verse 2: Brookfield Duece]
We don't switch, nah, I stay with my clique, for real
Y'all gon' flip, yeah, we gon' keep it lit, for real
Yeah, we made it, yeah, please don't try and hate it, nah
I get jaded, yeah, yeah
I come in invading
Y'all Willy Taylor
I only rock with them day ones, that's my flavor
That type to run when it get tough, I'll see you later
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Nah, we don't run with the haters
Oppas, grew up around some real players
We don't go crazy for fame, that's for lames
I've been off the Porsche [?]

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Got the realest with me
Rollin' through the city
I can't roll with y'all boys
Y'all be too mixed
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
Get the cash, get a chain, they the only thing changed
They go crazy for the fame
I think that's a small thing
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)

[Verse 3: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
I don't be down with all that drama
I love all my family and commas
Might go to the club with my momma
The realest be with me, I'm honored
Security with me, my cousins
They was there with me, you wasn't
"No pictures, baby, I'm buzzin'"
Rick just gonna end the discussion
Y'all loud mouths move in silence
Fake tough, ain't new to violence
East Oakland, immune to sirens
Jet talk, we do it private
We gettin' green, y'all sippin' lean
Mess with one, we movin' mean
Antennas up, repeat the scene
Fake tipsy, don't miss a thing

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Got the realest with me
Rollin' through the city
I can't roll with y'all boys
Y'all be too mixed
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
Get the cash, get a chain, they the only thing changed
They go crazy for the fame
I think that's a small thing
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
We don't switch sides (We don't switch sides)
