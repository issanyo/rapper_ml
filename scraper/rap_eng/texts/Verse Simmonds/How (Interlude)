[Intro]
Yeah
I don't even want to tell you
You know

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to trust you now
You made everything so different right now
How am I supposed to trust you now
You made everything so different right now
How am I supposed to trust you now
You made everything so different right now
How am I supposed to trust you now
Got me looking at you different right now

[Verse]
Been a player so I know the game
I can tell that you been up to things
I can smell a lie through your scream
I know what you say ain't what you mean
We decided we was working on it
I decided I'll do better for you
You know that this shit never been easy
Tell me why you wanna go make it harder for me

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to trust you now
You made everything so different right now
How am I supposed to trust you now
You made everything so different right now
How am I supposed to trust you now
You made everything so different right now
How am I supposed to trust you now
Got me looking at you different right now
