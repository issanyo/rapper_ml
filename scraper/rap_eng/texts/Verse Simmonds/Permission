[Verse 1]
With your permission
I just wanna spend a little time with you
With your permission
Tonight I wanna be a little me on you
With your permission
I wanna spend the night sipping on you

[Pre-Hook]
You know what I'm talking about baby, yeah
Now it's time for you to show me what it's hitting for
Sip a little jack, maybe blow a little dro
Love you from behind, but I hate to see you go

[Hook]
Come on give me that green light
You can let your hair hang down
Well only if it feels right
Oho, give me that green light
I need you, to give me that green light

[Verse 2]
With your permission
I just wanna put a little smile on you
With your permission
There's a whole lot of motherfuckin' lovin' that's way past due
I owe you
With your permission
I'ma do all the things that I said I'm gonna do

[Pre-Hook]
You know what I'm talking about baby, yeah
Now it's time for you to show me what it's hitting for
Sip a little jack, maybe blow a little dro
Love you from behind, but I hate to see you go

[Hook]
Come on give me that green light
You can let your hair hang down
Well only if it feels right
Oho, give me that green light
I need you, to give me that green light

[Bridge]
Can you feel it, can you feel it
Give it to me like you already made it forget it
I can feel it, can you feel it?
Give it to me like you already made it forget it
Ain't no pressure, it's all on you
There's attention, we must to
Red light special, girl you special
You a blessing, so let me bless you

So give me that green light, green light
Don't you say no
Baby I can't stop, won't stop
Until you say it's so
Give me that green light, green light
Don't you say no
Baby I can't stop, won't stop
Until you say it's so
Come on and give me that green light
Come on and give me
Come on and give me that green light

[Hook]
Come on give me that green light
You can let your hair hang down
Well only if it feels right
Oho, give me that green light
I need you, to give me that green light
