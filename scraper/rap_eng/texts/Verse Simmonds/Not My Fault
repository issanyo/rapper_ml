[Verse 1: T.I.]
You're beautiful for some dude who be talking terrible to

I thinking digging in her skirt get her drunk first
Them other guys bet you make them wait a month first

Some lean first and some loose ones for the young girls
Hol' up, hol' up

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
See I met her back in high school
She the one I never lie to (yeah, yeah)
The type that you always need beside you
Call her whenever and she gonna slide through (yeah)
She hold the heat when its getting hot
She roll the weed and then we getting gone
She look at me and she getting it on
Good sex till the morning
And she moaning
Leave a set of my clothing
I don't want to leave
She a tease with them poses
But I'm already on
Don't do it girl
I'm already grown
She want another round
I say "bitch, I'm going in"
It's alright
Oh boy, she just might

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Night it all on me
It ain't my fault
Got a couple bad bitches on me
It ain't my fault
Can't say anything to a G
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault
Night it all on me
It ain't my fault
Got a couple bad bitches on me
It ain't my fault
Can't say anything to a G
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault
Night it all on me
It ain't my fault
Got a couple bad bitches on me
It ain't my fault
Can't say anything to a G
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault
