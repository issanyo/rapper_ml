[Verse 1]
Dim the lights, where are the party girls, all my party girls?
Living life with all these beautiful women, yeah
He don't do you right, I'll treat you better, like you've never had it
I can see the big picture, you get the message, yeah girl
Let me tell you what we gon' do tonight, champagne gon' get you right
I can tell you the freaky type, I just need the green light
Baby, let me set your body free, sun up to sun down
Kissing you, you kissing me, you know it's alright

[Chorus]
Girl I see you dancing, tell the waiter bring more shots over here
This one's for you girl, it's for you girl, just for you girl
This one's for you girl, it's for you girl, just for you girl
I'm about to do some body shots on your pussy baby
On your pussy baby

[Verse 2]
Don't run away, what you running from? Know you wanna come with me
Let's run away tonight, together, forever baby
End the night like you never done before
Find my love, in the lights, it won't go away, the rays are on you now
I bet nobody ever did you better
Moving at the speed of sound
I'm trying to find your hidden treasure
Diving deep, girl I'm going down

[Chorus]
Girl I see you dancing, tell the waiter bring more shots over here
This one's for you girl, it's for you girl, just for you girl
This one's for you girl, it's for you girl, just for you girl
I'm about to do some body shots, turn the fuck up
On your pussy baby

[Outro]
This one's for you girl, it's for you girl, just for you girl
This one's for you girl, it's for you girl, just for you girl
