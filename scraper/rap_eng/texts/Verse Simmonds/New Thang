[Intro]
La MÃºsica de Harry Fraud

[Chorus: French Montana]
I might pull up a one, maybe two thangs (new thang)
Got my old-school joint in my new thang (old-school gang)
Got my Carolina joint, that's my blue thang (got a new)
Got my Chinese joint, that's my Wu-Tang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Got my Chinese joint, that's my Wu-Tang (skuh)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Trade the four-door for the coupe thing
She want the high heels, no shoestrings
Chicago floor seats, watchin' Luol Deng
Crib 36 Chambers, Wu-Tang
She ain't a groupie, but she do the group thing
Puff gave me mils off the blue flame
You niggas too jet, you too plain (what!)
Beard game, AK, like I'm Hussein
Chief Rocka on the bridge like MC Shan
KRS-One smokin' on an ether plant
Best thing out the Bronx since Big Pun
You know exactly where you get your shit from

[Chorus: French Montana]
I might pull up a one, maybe two thangs (new thang)
Got my old-school joint in my new thang (old-school gang)
Got my Carolina joint, that's my blue thang (got a new)
Got my Chinese joint, that's my Wu-Tang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Got my Chinese joint, that's my Wu-Tang

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
You see my shoe game, I kicks nice Liu Kang
You got 'em after you Saddam, you Hussein
Baby like "You changed", I be like "Who changed?"
I keep three K's on me like the pu-pu-pull-up in that Mulsanne
New watch, new chain
I Gotham cities on smash, I am Bruce Wayne
Make a milli-milli every week, yeah I'm the new Wayne
So much dope shit, I'm startin' to think I need a new flame
Yeah, I got a new name, now they call me Blue Face
I'm on fire, blue flames, one whip, two lanes
Tity Boi, no 2Chainz, Remy, no Zoo Gang
The only 12 I fuck with is called the Flu Games

[Chorus: Remy Ma]
I might pull up one, maybe two things (new thang)
Got my old-school joint in my new thang (old-school gang)
Got my Carolina joint, that's my blue thang (got a new)
Got my Chinese joint, that's my Wu-Tang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Got my Chinese joint, that's my Wu-Tang

[Chorus: French Montana]
I might pull up a one, maybe two thangs (new thang)
Got my old-school joint in my new thang (old-school gang)
Got my Carolina joint, that's my blue thang (got a new)
Got my Chinese joint, that's my Wu-Tang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Every other day is a New Thang (hey hey hey)
Got my Chinese joint, that's my Wu-Tang
