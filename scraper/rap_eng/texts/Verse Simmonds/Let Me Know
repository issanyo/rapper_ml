[Hook]
Girl you know I'm feeling you
Yeah when it's just us two
Mean no disrespect to you
But if that's your girl, can she come too?
Let me know, let me know
Baby you can come and she can come too
Let me know, let me know
Baby let me know if she can come too

[Verse 1]
Baby I don't mean no disrespect
Maybe it's the liquor, maybe I'm just lit
Maybe I'm just imaging shit
But it can't hurt to try, no no way
Keep it real with the fly
We can fuck in the mirror
Me, you and her
A triangle affair
I got loving to tell you, you know what it is
You be talking that shit, I been waiting for this
Hurry up, I'm not late
Hope you don't feel no way, I been thinking about this all day
She been on you and you been on me
We can make this shit one big party
And I hope you not selfish baby
Cause I'm feeling you, I'm feeling

[Hook]
Girl you know I'm feeling you
Yeah when it's just us two
Mean no disrespect to you
But if that's your girl, can she come too?
Let me know, let me know
Baby you can come and she can come too
Let me know, let me know
Baby let me know if she can come too

[Verse 2]
Might think that I'm wrong for this
You might think that I'm scandalous
And I don't know if you into this
But I can't help but notice
You admiring her, she admiring you
Got all up on each other, y'all up to no good
Body language
I can read your body language
I can see your real intentions
Y'all ain't fooling anybody
And it's right after the party
We gon' have ourselves a party

[Hook]
Girl you know I'm feeling you
Yeah when it's just us two
Mean no disrespect to you
But if that's your girl, can she come too?
Let me know, let me know
Baby you can come and she can come too
Let me know, let me know
Baby let me know if she can come too

[Outro]
Your flirting days all over each other
Y'all smacking ass and god damn, I love it
We ain't gotta play by the rules
Let's go ahead and get us a room
