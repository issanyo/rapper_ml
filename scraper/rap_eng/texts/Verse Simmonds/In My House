[Verse 1]
These girls be comin' over tryna leave that avalanche
She know I got a girl, she just tryna start some shit
Leavin' her hairpins on the counter, that's the little things
Hidin' them panties in the covers, oh you scandalous
Oh you know, you know what you doin'
You know what you doin'
Yeah you know, we ain't supposed to be doin'
The things that we doin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So why you actin' brand new?
And you already new
Why you makin' this hard?
I'mma have explainin' to do
Like who this hair belong to?
And who been in my bedroom?
How many times I gotta say it?
Thought I already told you

[Chorus]
Stop leavin' shit in my house
Don't be leavin' shit in my house
Don't be takin' sneak pictures
Talkin' 'bout how you be livin' when you in my house
Stop leavin' shit in my house
Don't be leavin' shit in my house
Don't be textin' these bitches sayin'
You're here with your nigga when you in my house

[Verse 2]
Girl, you must be tryna get me fucked up
All this back and forth makin' me nervous
Why your lashes in the trash anyway?
Why you came with all them bags anyway?
All in my house, layin' up in my bed
Snapchattin' that pussy girl, they gon' recognise that you here
Sprayin' all your perfume, tryna leave your scent in the air
I should have never brought you here, you know you ain't playin' fair

[Pre-Chorus]
So why you actin' brand new?
And you already new
Why you makin' this hard?
I'mma have explainin' to do
Like who this hair belong to?
And who been in my bedroom?
How many times I gotta say it?
Thought I already told you

[Chorus]
Stop leavin' shit in my house
Don't be leavin' shit in my house
Don't be takin' sneak pictures
Talkin' 'bout how you be livin' when you in my house
Stop leavin' shit in my house
Don't be leavin' shit in my house
Don't be textin' these bitches sayin'
You're here with your nigga when you in my house

[Verse 3]
Now grab that make up bag you left up in the bathroom
And don't you say a word if anybody ask you
You knew what time it was the moment that we hit the door
This ain't the time to switch it up, stop actin' brand new
This ain't the time to switch it up, stop actin' brand new
Red lipstick all on my collar, girl, this shirt was brand new
We was Californicatin', gettin' drunk and medicated
Before you go, do me a favor, baby leave up with what you came with

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you actin' brand new?
And you already new
Why you makin' this hard?
I'mma have explainin' to do
Like who this hair belong to?
And who been in my bedroom?
How many times I gotta say it?
Thought I already told you

[Chorus]
Stop leavin' shit in my house
Don't be leavin' shit in my house
Don't be takin' sneak pictures
Talkin' 'bout how you be livin' when you in my house
Stop leavin' shit in my house
Don't be leavin' shit in my house
Don't be textin' these bitches sayin'
You're here with your nigga when you in my house
