[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
Ok, this shit is so random
And when I'm with you it's like our heartbeats are in tandem
And when our lips lock, I just want you hold your face for ransom
Your beautiful and I'm handsome
That'll be good for the babies, if ever we go there maybe
It's crazy, no titles, but your my baby, when I'm idle
That's your time, showtime, and for you I wish I had more time
Red wine, chocolate, baby you could be my Valentine
More than just sex exchanged, baby you my Boo Thang

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
Hey girl, so glad that I found ya (Uh-huh!)
Tell your friends they leaving without ya
Got a hotel room with a view of the city
That I know you going to like
Got the candles leading to the bathtub baby
Let's hop inside and ride in the two door with the roof gone
My oh my, baby it's been too long
So, grab your coat and your purse, I'll walk out of here first
Wait about five and I'll be parked outside

[Pre-Hook: Verse Simmonds]
And I know we ain't got no strings attached
But this could be a perfect match
And girl we ain't no cuddie buddies
Cause this is way more than that

[Hook: Verse Simmonds & (Kelly Rowland)]
You're my boo thang, can't get enough
I love your stuff, let's turn it up, you get what you want
Cause your my boo thang, and when your friends ask
I'm not your man just the closest thing that you have
To a boo thang
(Boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, ooh)
You're my boo thang
(Boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, ooh)

[Verse 3: Verse Simmonds]
Hey girl, I can't leave here without ya (Uh-huh!)
And how you're looking, I love everything about ya
Girl it's more than body, I'm making love to your mind
And everytime that I want you, you're ready all of the time

[Pre-Hook: Verse Simmonds]
And I know we ain't got no strings attached
But this could be a perfect match
And girl we ain't no cuddie buddies
Cause this is way more than that

[Hook: Verse Simmonds & (Kelly Rowland)]
You're my boo thang, can't get enough
I love your stuff, let's turn it up, you get what you want
Cause your my boo thang, and when your friends ask
I'm not your man just the closest thing that you have
To a boo thang
(Boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, ooh)
You're my boo thang
(Boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, ooh)

[Verse 4: Kelly Rowland]
Baby turn the lights off, cause all I wanna do is touch you
We can make a movie baby, nobody do it like us two
Yeah, boy put your hands all on my body
Ride that thing just like a Harley, so come on and get it started
Turn the lights off! Baby turn the lights off!
Baby turn the lights off! Just turn the lights off!

[Bridge: Bu Thiam]
Turn the lights off baby
I need you to follow my lead
I wanna make you feel good
I wanna make you feel like you've never felt before
Can I do that? Bu Vision

[Hook: Verse Simmonds & (Kelly Rowland)]
You're my boo thang, can't get enough
I love your stuff, let's turn it up, you get what you want
Cause your my boo thang, and when your friends ask
I'm not your man just the closest thing that you have
To a boo thang
(Boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, ooh)
You're my boo thang
(Boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, ooh)
