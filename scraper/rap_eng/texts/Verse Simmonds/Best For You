[Verse 1]
This might be one of my illest rhymes ever
This might be one of the realest times ever
Time fly by, nothing gon' last forever
And that's a shame cause I been thinking 'bout you
Lately baby, things been a little crazy
You walk by like we ain't even acquainted
I seen you from the moment that you came in
Still after all this time, you look amazing
Jobs gon' do
Henny on the rocks won't do it
Guess I'll burn another one too
Bet them other niggas make it happen
Taking advantage, I should just call you
But I can't take those chances
This is not what I imagined, this is not where it's supposed to go
This is not the way it's supposed to happen
Lately I been on the road, fucking everything that's attractive
Testing my relationship to see if I can find the magic

[Hook]
So maybe it's the best thing for you
Cause I might be the worst one for you
Maybe after all the time, you deserve more than half my time
So maybe he's the best thing for you

[Verse 2]
You win some, you lose some
But if you learn some, you lost none
Regret in your heart
Cause you're still torn apart
I know you lost your faith in me
I'm not the man you thought I'd be
I'm just a different pedigree
I guess it's just the dog in me
If you can't love it then leave it
Tears in your eyes but your heart's all the pieces
I had to give it back cause you gon' need it
I had to flex it babe so you could see it
I had to grow up
Grab me that liquor and pour up
Fuck it, someone at the doorway
I'm not the one and you know it

[Hook]
So maybe it's the best thing for you
Cause I might be the worst one for you
Maybe after all the time, you deserve more than half my time
So maybe he's the best thing for you

[Bridge]
I'm no good for ya
Know that I tried, know that I tried
I'm no good for ya
But I don't know why and I don't know why
I'm no good for ya
Can't even lie, can't even lie
I'm no good for ya
Can't even lie

[Hook]
So maybe it's the best thing for you
Cause I might be the worst one for you
Maybe after all the time, you deserve more than half my time
So maybe he's the best thing for you
So maybe it's the best thing for you
Cause I might be the worst one for you
Maybe after all the time, you deserve more than half my time
So maybe he's the best thing for you
