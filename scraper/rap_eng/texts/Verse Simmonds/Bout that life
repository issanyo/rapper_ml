She 'bout that life
You know she 'bout that life

[Bridge]
Is that your girl I doubt it
'Cause every time she with me she about it
Yeah that's my freak no doubt about it
We get it in every time I like
Kinda wrong but it feels so right
She bout that life

[Verse]
She told her let her hair down
Automatic you already know what's going down
Take a shot at this and baby you know what to do
Just bend but I feel like I've been knowing you
Your man ain't got to know that we loving
And I promise I won't say a thing
I know that you've been thinking 'bout leaving
So we did it in Miami on our birthday weekend

[Bridge]
Is that your girl I doubt it
'Cause every time she with me she about it
Yeah that's my freak no doubt about it
We get it in every time I like
Kinda wrong but it feels so right
She 'bout that life

[Hook]

[Verse]
I said she 'bout that life yes she 'bout that ex
Get all alone best believe I'll smash
Girl like bitch best believe I'm messing
Sit back and chill let me tell you how it happened
At the club at the bar she was chilling with a guy
Strong and a fucker so a nigga getting high
Cute face little waist long hair pretty fly
Lil mama too late to kill now she looking tired
Real niggas feel me put your hands in the sky
You ain't turned up then you might as well die
Nigga I put the dick on her make her leave you twice
FYI she about that life

[Bridge]
Is that your girl I doubt it
'Cause every time she with me she about it
Yeah that's my freak no doubt about it
We get it in every time I like
Kinda wrong but it feels so right
She bout that life

[Verse]
Got her open like a sitafal
Digging deep looking for the gold
She got a body like a super freak
Type every nigga wanna keep
So I hit it , hit it I hit it good
Man I hit it like she said a nigga never could
I told her baby back that ass up
You know I like it when you backing that ass up
Your man ain't got to know that we loving
And I promise I won't say a thing

[Bridge]
Is that your girl I doubt it
'Cause every time she with me she about it
Yeah that's my freak no doubt about it
We get it in every time I like
Kinda wrong but it feels so right
She bout that life

[Hook]
