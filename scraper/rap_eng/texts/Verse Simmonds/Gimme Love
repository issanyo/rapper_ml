Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love

[Verse 1]
I got what you like boy, come close to me
It's just you and me here as far as I can see
I ain't seen nobody with you, wanna be invited
Cause it's the way you're looking at me, you got me excited

[Pre-Chorus]
Make your move babe before I see something new
Body on, you know that it's only calling you
I'm hearing what you say, yeah, I want that too
Got your hands up on mine, let me blow your mind
While you....

[Chorus]
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little
Baby love
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little
This is crazy
We're crazy
[?]
This is crazy

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens next boy, it's up to you
Making me feel like I'm the only one in the room
Just another sip and I'll be alright
Got my head spinning babe, blinded by the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
Make your move babe before I see something new
Body on, you know that it's only calling you
I'm hearing what you say, yeah, I want that too
Got your hands up on mine, let me blow your mind
While you....

[Chorus]
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little
Baby love
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little
This is crazy
We're crazy
[?]
This is crazy

[Refrain]
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah, love
Nah, nah, nah, nah


[Pre-Chorus]
Make your move babe before I see something new
Body on, you know that it's only calling you
I'm hearing what you say, yeah, I want that too
Got your hands up on mine, let me blow your mind
While you....

[Chorus]
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Gimme love
A little, a little, a little
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little
Baby love
A little, a little, a little
Get some love
A little, a little, a little

[Outro]
Gimme love
