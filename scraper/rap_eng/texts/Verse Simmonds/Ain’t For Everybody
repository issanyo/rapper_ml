[Intro: Verse Simmonds]
Pick you up, hold you
I'm checking for you, yeah
You that one, showing off
I'm checking for you, yeah

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Cause you ain't for everybody
You ain't just for anybody
You don't do things for just anybody
Are you really that somebody if I want somebody?

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
I know you tired playin' with them losers
So hot, need a fan or a cooler
Make up just for fun, you don't need it
Rock them clip ins when you want, don't need it
Yellin' money over bitches, and you mean it
You ain't trippin' on these niggas, you don't need 'em
Full time on your job, you be on it
It might take a little time, but you on it

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Cause you ain't for everybody
You ain't just for anybody
You don't do things for just anybody
Are you really that somebody?
Found somebody
Cause you ain't for everybody
You ain't just for anybody
You don't do things for just anybody
Are you really that somebody if I want somebody?

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
Love them probably, you don't do it like the others
Every time you go missin', you come back later
You're not the easy type, you like to take your time
If anythin' meant for you girl, that's meant for you girl
I know you heard it all your life, I just wanna be a prayer for you
Heard you lookin' for a real one, never had a man pray for you
You keep it all on the low, you ain't competin' with hoes
You know exactly how this thing gon' go, these niggas is mad and bitches gon' hate

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Cause you ain't for everybody
You ain't just for anybody

Cause you ain't for everybody
You ain't just for anybody
You don't do things for just anybody
Are you really that somebody if I want somebody?

[Verse 3: Verse Simmonds]
Girl, you rockin' with a real one
I can hit it, make you feel good
Top it off and make it real wet
That's the type of shit they can't get
I do the things that they won't do
I'm goin' hard cause I want you
I want you

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Cause you ain't for everybody
You ain't just for anybody
You don't do things for just anybody
Are you really that somebody?
Found somebody
Cause you ain't for everybody
You ain't just for anybody
You don't do things for just anybody
Are you really that somebody if I want somebody?

[Bridge: Verse Simmonds]
Cause if everybody already had it, I don't want it
If everybody already had it, I don't want it, keepin' it 100
Cause you're too good for that
Are you really that somebody if I want somebody?

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
Somebody, somebody to love me
Oh, yeah
I need some-somebody to care, yeah
I only need somebody
