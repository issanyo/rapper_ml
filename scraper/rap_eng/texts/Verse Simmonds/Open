[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Baby, just open, like I got the password to your heart
Got you wide open
You can open wide, you can take it off
Open, open, baby just open
Can you keep it open?

[Verse 1: Meek Mil]
Yeah, fucking you like I just got out the pen
I got you open like I got the pin
Fly out the city and I'll fly you in
Girl, yeah, she bought her homie and I got a friend
She throw it back, dirty whining again
Instant replay, I rewind it again
Shawty bust it open, lay it down
Had to brush up on it, tell her say it now
Niggas hatin' on me, throwin' shade now
'Cause I'm gettin' money and I'm paid now
Had to run it up, on my way now
Only jealous 'cause them niggas lay it down
Got her in a Maybach with her pants down
Put the curtains up and put your head down
Do a headstand, put your ass up
If the pussy good, I get a cash out
If you fucking with me, better answer
Balling in the six like I'm a Raptor
She be only fucking with the trappers
Know the hatin' shit ain't gettin' past us
'Cause you only told her that I only want to hit it
Preachin' to the choir, you the baddest (Ohh)

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Baby, just open, like I got the password to your heart
Got you wide open
You can open wide, you can take it off
Open, open, baby just open
Can you keep it open?

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
Shawty, keep it open like it's 7/11
We might make a scene and shoot that movie wherever
I'm gonna write my name with my tongue, tongue, tongue
All over your body, yeah I know what you want
Keeps them legs up in the air
All this room in the Panemera, girl, that's enough for me
I know we just did it, like do it again, girl, that wasn't enough for me
All these tender kisses, all the way, girl
Then I put them kisses below your waistline
You know I don't play around
Do you better than the last time
Going it like Curry from the baseline
Triple up and dip it low, lay it down
Hit it like I just got out of fed time
Got her thanking mama for that ass now
Got her thanking daddy 'cause you classy
Got her thanking mouth 'cause you nasty

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Baby, just open, like I got the password to your heart
Got you wide open
You can open wide, you can take it off
Open, open, baby just open
Can you keep it open?

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Lil' fish talk (Ah ha ha)
Ah, told her that I would protect her
Went to the jeweler, Patek'd her
Patek Phillipe, she grabbing it deep
She caught it like OD Beckham, pause
Had it, but she never let 'em, ah
Hit it 'cause I do it better, ah
I'm in here, changing the weather, ah
Level up, change for the better, ah
Fuck around and be on TMZ
Paparazzi popping when you be with me
I be flexin' on 'em like it's GNC see
Got that bomb, bomb, call you T.N.T
Only pom-poms when I'm ballin'
Talking bron-bron when I hit the three
Got you open when we coastin'
Talking wraith talk when we rolling like

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Baby, just open, like I got the password to your heart
Got you wide open
You can open wide, you can take it off
Open, open, baby just open
Can you keep it open?
