[Verse 1]
Listen to the words you say
Bullets, how they penetrate
You don't even hesitate (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't you see the love mistake
Stole my heart and got away
Crooked love can't get it straight (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a dirty record
I think you should be doing time
But I would never turn you in
Put that on my life

[Chorus]
It's in those eyes
Your fibs
That poisonous kiss
Baby, look at all the weapons that you're killing me with
And I wish I never met you
(I wish I never met you)
Feeling your touch, your skin
That beautiful sin
Baby look at all the weapons that you're killing me with
And I wish I never met you
(I wish I never met you)
I wish I never met you

[Verse 2]
Broken windows, broken glass
Memories of fights we had
We should be in jail for that (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pictures of us from the past
Show me things that I can't have
You know that you wrong for that (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a dirty record
I think you should be doing time
But I would never turn you in
I'll put that on my life

[Chorus]
It's in those eyes
Your fibs
That poisonous kiss
Baby, look at all the weapons that you're killing me with
And I wish I never met you
(I wish I never met you)
I wish I never met you
Feeling your touch, your skin
That beautiful sin
Baby, look at all the weapons that you're killing me with
And I wish I never met you
(I wish I never met you)
I wish I never met you

I wish I never met you
(I wish I never met you)
I wish I never met you

[Bridge]
There's nothing like diving in the deep end
Loving you's a reflex
But the recovery's my weakness
My weakness

[Chorus]
It's in those eyes
Your fibs
That poisonous kiss
Baby, look at all the weapons that you're killing me with
And I wish I never met you
(I wish I never met you)
I wish I never met you
Feeling your touch, your skin
That beautiful sin
Baby, look at all the weapons that you're killing me with
And I wish I never met you
(I wish I never met you)
I wish I never met you

I wish I never met you
(I wish I never met you)
I wish I never met you
