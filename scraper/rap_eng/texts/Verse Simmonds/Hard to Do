[Vesre 1]
I've been thinking bout ya
Are you thinking bout me?
I know I went crazy
But you were wrong
I apologize, I'll let it go tonight
Forgive me and I'll forgive you

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause what you gon' do
When I put that pretty thing on you
I usually don't do this
But I'll do it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, baby cause...
Missing you is way too hard to do
I'd rather be fucking you
Do you mind if I give you love
Cause I just wanna give you love
Won't you tell me if I'm doing too much
Missing you is way too hard to do

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been in my feelings
Dealing with the daily thoughts of missing you
I ain't dialing but my body's calling for ya
Breaking down, gotta give it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause what you gon' do
When I put that pretty thing on you
I usually don't do this
But I'll do it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, baby cause...
Missing you is way too hard to do
I'd rather be fucking you
Do you mind if I give you love
Cause I just wanna give you love
Won't you tell me if I'm doing too much
Missing you is way too hard to do

[Verse 3]
Don't get along all the time
Just want your body on mine
And you can call it what you wanna
But I'ma call you when I want it
Fishnets and trench coats
Underneath, it's a bomb
America's most wanted
Errrbody up on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause what you gon' do
When I put that pretty thing on you
I usually don't do this
But I'll do it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, baby cause...
Missing you is way too hard to do
I'd rather be fucking you
Do you mind if I give you love
Cause I just wanna give you love
Won't you tell me if I'm doing too much
Missing you is way too hard to do
