[Chorus: Ally]
Blaze it up and we'll be cruising with the top down
Rev up the engine, we'll be cruising, watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be riding with my top down
With my top down, my top down

[Verse 1: Camila]
Yup, from a small town cruising through the big city
Where the fellas are cute and the girls are pretty
It's our world so you know, it's going down
I ain't got a lotta money but I got a lotta style, what what

[Chorus: Ally]
Blaze it up and we'll be cruising with the top down
Rev up the engine, we'll be cruising, watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be riding with my top down
With my top down, my top down

[Bridge: Lauren]
Electric city, baby, you're mine tonight
Electric city, don't you shine bright
Electric city, baby, you light the way
Electric city, I think that I might stay

[Verse 2: Normani & Dinah & (Lauren)]
Passed out real and I woke up realer
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Me and my clique going hard and you feel us
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Come on let me take you for a ride
I ain't got a lotta money but I got a lotta style, what what

[Chorus: Ally]
Blaze it up and we'll be cruising with the top down
Rev up the engine, we'll be cruising, watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be riding with my top down
With my top down, my top down

[Bridge: Lauren]
Electric city, baby, you're mine tonight
Electric city, don't you shine bright
Electric city, baby, you light the way
Electric city, I think that I might stay

[Instrumental Beat Breakdown]

[Chorus: Ally]
Blaze it up and we'll be cruising with the top down
Rev up the engine, we'll be cruising, watch it go down
Get in my truck and I'll be riding with my top down
With my top down, my top down

[Bridge: Lauren]
Electric city, baby, you're mine tonight
Electric city, don't you shine bright
Electric city, baby, you light the way
Electric city, I think that I might stay
