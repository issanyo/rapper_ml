[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
I know its hard to see, that I care baby
And you’re my number 1, cause I got 2 or 3
Im just keeping it real, I know your feelings deep
I know its hard to speak, but i was busy last week
So my heart don’t fail, That i said lets chill
You ain’t going no where, I ain’t going no where
Baby its our world, and we make our own rules
As long as you never lie to me, imma never lie to you

[Bridge]
Fuck em all day, fuck em all night
Shawty these are the moments that we liven for
Theyll never let her catch on you way down
But everybody got something to say
Take a hit of this and lets riiiide
And when you’re homegirls say i ain’t shit
Tell em don’t worry about this

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
Ain’t nobody believe in love no more
And niggas don’t dance in the club no more
We all crave attention not respect no more
And before the good girls niggas loving these hoes (hoe’s winning)
Homegirl said it
Said its been a couple years since she had a man
All these niggas trying to lay, they ain’t trying to stay
All these niggas trying to play, they ain’t trying to plan
And all these bad bitches turning up for their Instagram
Bust it open then complain my niggas trying to get at them
Thirsty niggas trying to fuck, we all up in that (?)
Now she’s spending money, now you all up at the ATM
None of my business, none of my business (yeah yeahhh)
Cuz baby me and you a little different
Kept it real, right from the beginning (ahhhhhh)

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Verse Simmonds]
Then she told me she ain’t ready for a man in her life
She’s too busy getting money, for a man in her life
Dream so big she can’t even sleep in the night
She just want a real nigga, that can put the D in her life (consistent)
Cuz relationships are overrated
She just need one to hang with
So we can talk that body language

So come a little closer pull me in a little tighter
Cuz the rhythm in this bed put the room on fire
Baby tell me your desires
Baby let me take you higher
