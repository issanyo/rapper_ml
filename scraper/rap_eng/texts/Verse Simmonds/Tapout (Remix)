[Intro: JG Trigga]
We going in this Young Money track right here!
Chea!

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
All around this room, baby me and you (Let’s go, ha!)
I don't wanna let you down
That's the perfect view, looking at you
I just wanna love you down
You got that million dollar, that million dollar, turn up
I got that cranberry and juice in my cup, what's up
And I've been looking for somebody I can spend this money on
Make a tapout (Then do it)
Wait, hold up, party just beginning
And I know that we ain't married
But this don't feel like sinning, ah
This one is for you, perfect crazy, sexy, cool
Work it, all I want is you, eat that pussy till it's cool
Tight like blue, just us 2, girl let's get stuck together
There's a storm in this house, but outside it's perfect weather
Break the arm of the couch, cause we fucking like we mean it
Let's have alien sex, I'm from Mars, you from Venus

[Hook: Future]
She got that million dollar
Million dollar oow, oow
She got that million dollar
Million dollar oow, oow
And all I want to do is touch it (oow, oow)
Make her tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout
And I'm gon' make her tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout

[Verse 2: JG Trigga]
Pumps on the clutch, boots on the dutch
Navigation, finding ways to my hut
We stacking millions and millions, every buck
We gon’ acting like we don’t give a f---
Tapout tapout, you nailed, got hammered
Droppin em like jeans that wore by MC Hammer
Shutter words, messin’ up grammars
Paris in Paris, french kissers go hammers
Black Rolex watch, million dollar spending
Not in stores yea, don’t be doing endings
Money change in game, like it’s a range
Door shit in the club, bitch rep the gang

[Hook: Future]
She got that million dollar (Rich Gang)
Million dollar oow, oow (Rich Girl)
She got that million dollar (Sexy Slim, I see you, Paradise home, yea)
Million dollar oow, oow (Flossing while you're shining. Jumping out of Bugattis)
And all I want to do is touch it (oow, oow)
Make her tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout (Fuck the money game up)
And I'm gon' make her tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout (Why? I don't know
Sweet D! Love you babygirl)

[Outro: Detail]
I’m in love with your Egyptian skin
And your talk about religion
I’m in prison with the pussy
And I’m ballin' no cushion
