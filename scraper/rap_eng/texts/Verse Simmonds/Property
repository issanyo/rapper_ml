[Intro: Verse Simmonds (& Kid Ink)]
My property (Ah yeah)
Like you are my property (Ah yeah)

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Like you are my property, like you are my property
I know mine just can't take you apart from me
My property, yeah-yeah, my property

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
This thing been getting messy-messy
I've never been the type to lovey-lovey
I know I had to change that up for you though
Baby you have to help me out, ayuda
I heard the silence through the noise
Hope that you are not with other boys
I can be more than just a friend
I can be more than just your friend

[Bridge 1: Verse Simmonds]
I'ma need your love
Energy give me everything
On top of me like a crown
Baby that's where I want you

Nobody getting in the way-ay-ay-ay
Ain't nobody taking you away-ay-ay-ay
Ain't nobody getting in the way

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
This crazy life that I live
Can't say that I don't show effort
These other women drive like peasants
They never gonna keep my pleasure
Don't ignore me
Cause it's never what you think it is
When I'm not answering
Girl listen my story

[Bridge 1: Verse Simmonds]
I'ma need your love
Energy give me everything
On top of me like a crown
Baby that's where I want you

Ain't nobody taking you away-ay-ay-ay

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I said you are my property
You know I kill it at Monopoly
Most of them playing can't afford ya
Make sure you purse ain't, price is the mortgage
Everything I buy the opposite of foreign
Anywhere book a flight, now she boarding
Touchdown could shut down a city
Take a shot, another round in the semi
I love it, I love when you get in your begging
That's when I video, video Snapchat
Your heart broke before I could leave, I could pass that
So my name is tat there

[Hook: Verse Simmonds] (2x)
Like you are property, like you are my property
I know mine just can't take you apart from me
My property, yeah-yeah, my property

[Bridge 2: Verse Simmonds]
Nobody getting in the way-ay-ay-ay
Ain't nobody taking you away-ay-ay-ay
Ain't nobody getting in the way

[Outro: Kid Ink]
Cause we ain't got a whole lotta space
Now you gotta lot below the waist
I know I hit the lotto when I place that bid
Ah yeah
