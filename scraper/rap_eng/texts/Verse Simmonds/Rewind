[Hook: Akon]
Nights like this gotta get a little crazy
Taking all these shots like
I can't miss, time to get a little crazy
She throwin' that back like
I pressed rewind
I pressed rewind

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I think I might've missed somethin'
All the messages that I get from
Your body callin', saying come and get some
Rewind, let me get a better listen
First name, last name, put you on a listin'
We could go for rounds like Sonny Liston
Pound for pound I got that OG
Stop lookin' around, this were you 'pposed be
Come in, take a seat with me
The line outside like the DMV
And I heard you was lookin' for the TNT in me
Baby girl I could blow your mind

[Pre-Hook: Akon (Kid Ink)]
You got that good shit that's hard to find
You got that Ohh Yeah, you know me love you long time
I wanna know about all the good things and the bad things
(That we could do)
I wanna know about all the good things and the bad things
(That we could do baby)

[Hook 2: Akon]
Nights like this
Taking all these shots like
I can't miss
She throwin' that back like
I pressed rewind

[Verse 2: Kid Ink (Akon) ]
I'm all yours
From where I'm sitting baby girl I got a good view
I'm all yours
And the way I've been shooting lately ain't no way that I could lose
Champagne and Tequila, ain't no way I could choose one
I just mix it all in my solution
Make sure there's no confusion
You got that bomb pussy, I know just how to defuse it
Snake hiss swishin' to your hair like Medusa
Let me get you high baby, all the way to Jupiter
It's the time for you to choose, I know you in the mood
I can tell how you move to the music

[Pre-Hook: Akon (Kid Ink)]
You got that good shit that's hard to find
You got that oh yeah, know me love you long time
I wanna know about all the good things and the bad things
(That we could do)
I wanna know about all the good things and the bad things
(That we could do baby)

[Bridge: Akon & (Kid Ink)]
(I'm all yours)
Bust it open for me baby
(i'm all yours)
Booty floatin' like a milkshake
Face just like coco
But my baby's loco
Stay livin' YOLO
Like we're doin' a bando

[Pre-Hook: Akon (Kid Ink)]
You got that good shit that's hard to find
You got that oh yeah, know me love you long time
I wanna know about all the good things and the bad things
(That we could do)
I wanna know about all the good things and the bad things
