[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko]
Said I'm all up in my feelings, doubled up on this shot
Got me feeling some type of way told you I hate you I don't mean it
And the only thing that I got
Is the pain that you've been feeding
Faded, faded, faded, all because of you
Now my current situation, trying not to think of you, not to break the rules
Why this always happens, when I get this way?
Just can't stop myself, so baby tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhene Aiko]
I'm blowing up your line, I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight, so I'll be
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah baby I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko]
Drunk texting you, drunk texting you
Drunk texting you, drunk texting you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Jhene Aiko]
I'm looking at my phone thinking
Am I gonna hit send or nah?
It's gonna be one of them mornings when I wake up and regret it
If I don't get no reply
I don't wanna make it obvious that I'm faded, faded, faded off a drink or two
And you know how it goes, this ain't nothing new
Why's it always happen, when I get this way?
No I just can't stop myself, so baby tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhene Aiko]
I'm blowing up your line, I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight, so I'll be
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah baby I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Jhene Aiko]
Intoxicated, intoxicated
That's when I think of you the most, but after the toast, anything goes
When I put my pride aside
I'll be doing the most, doing the most
I done spent 1, 2, 3 AM, thinking about you
Don't wanna be without you, cause I'm on that liquid courage
I hope this shit is worth it, cause if it ain't then it's all bad, all bad
So baby tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhene Aiko]
I'm blowing up your line, I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight, so I'll be
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you
Yeah baby I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting, drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

[Outro: Chris Brown & Jhene Aiko]
If by chance you're laying next to someone else right now
I hope it's the worst sex ever, hope it's the worst sex ever
