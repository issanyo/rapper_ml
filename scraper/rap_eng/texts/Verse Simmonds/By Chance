[Intro: Lecrae]
Zaytoven
I seen so many impossible stories become possible
If we can do it, it can be done
And if you got God on your side, then there ain't nothing you can't do
What you waiting for?

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Cause nothin' is by chance
Give me the strength to understand the things you see that I can’t
Had to call my problems and I put em all in your hands
I know that this is your plan
If it was easy no I wouldn’t be a strong man
Now I put my bets on you cause nothin’s by chance

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I started off in my apartment
Me & T dot in the kitchen
I was workin on the beats and he was workin on his writtens
We just hope someone would listen
Go that tat say 116
Ain’t have nothing but a mission
Missed a couple months of rent
But woooaahh
We done came a long way now
God be listen when i pray now
Came from country roads and riding on the train now
Now we in a private plane ain’t no flexin I’m just sayin
Woooow
So tell me what you waiting for
You ain’t gotta sell them thangs Bol
Went to Philly told the city Free meek milly
If he ever need to talk hope he know I’m out here prayin for em

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Cause nothin' is by chance
Give me the strength to understand the things you see that I can’t
Had to call my problems and I put em all in your hands
I know that this is your plan
If it was easy no I wouldn’t be a strong man
Now I put my bets on you cause nothin’s by chance

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Got two sisters they my ladies
They was both born in the 80’s
They Struggles
They got babies
But they all in ain’t no maybes
Seen em hustle from the bottom
Gettin' to do it on the daily
It’s enough to drive you crazy
Even with that new Mercedes yeah
Seen em grind til' they shoes scuff
My Shawty used to drive the school bus
Never act like she too good for it
Sleeping on the floor when they was shooting in the hood bruh
Lil Mama what you waiting for
Start that business on go & get it, girl
Don’t let 'em tell you can’t do it
Brought you to it bring you through it
You know God help you through it girl

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Cause nothin' is by chance
Give me the strength to understand the things you see that I can’t
Had to call my problems and I put em all in your hands
I know that this is your plan
If it was easy no I wouldn’t be a strong man
Now I put my bets on you cause nothin’s by chance
