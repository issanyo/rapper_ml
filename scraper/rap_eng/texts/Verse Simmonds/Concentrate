[Verse 1]

I dont wanna move too fast
I dont wanna move to slow
I just wanna' make it last
Ima' hit that shit til' you want some more
Them red lips girl...
Put'em all on me
Im focused baby, my aim is to please
I ain't tryna be selfish, I want you to get yours...

[Hook]

All I gotta do is concentrate, concentrate...
All I gotta do is concentrate, concentrate...
All I gotta do is concentrate, concentrate...
All I gotta do is concentrate, concentrate...



[verse 2]

Meditation
For this sex drive, youre my inspiration
I got the key to your heart
And its racing... I wanna take my time so be patient...
Keep making those sounds
Turning me on
I'll hold it for you baby, I won't let you down
I ain't tryna' be selfish
I want you to get...yours...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Okay. Whats ya sign, whats ya sign?
Im a virgo whats ya sign
Now we here together baby tell me whats been on your mind
Concentrate, concentrate
I go deeper baby wait
Girl if this thing creep up...
Youll be mad. But I'LL BE STRAIGHT
I can't do you like that, you lovin it
But I ain't holding nothing back
Control...
You a young Janet Jackson, hit you with 2Pac its thug passion
Poetic Justice, I got the juice
Keep ya head up cause I like the view
I get around, but ain't nothing like you
Smoking California love but im sippin that duece
Keep making those sounds
Turning me on
I'll hold it for you baby, I won't let you down
I ain't tryna' be selfish
I want you to get...yours...baby
