[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Never mind all these other bitches, baby you the best
I'm gon' throw all this money till I ain't got nothin' left
Take ya time with me baby, I want all that I can get
All of this is yours, but I just got one request

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
Me, you and ya friends, damn we goin' in
Shawty, drop another bottle just in case tonight's the end
Take a hit of this, we jumpin' out the window
All that ass, you gotta turn a priest into a nympho
And you bad as fuck, you bad as fuck
Stepped out lookin' so glamorous, uh huh
All these hoes lookin' like fans of yours, uh huh
Girl I'd have a party all over your body if you let me
Girl don't act like you don't know
Do that shit that you been practicin' at home all alone
You just downed a half of bottle of Patron' on your own
Oh you gone? Yeah, you gone
It's okay 'cause you grown take it low as it go

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Never mind all these other bitches, baby you the best
I'm gon' throw all this money till I ain't got nothin' left
Take ya time with me baby, I want all that I can get
All of this is yours, but I just got one request

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
Yeah, shake it like you in Vegas
Shake it like you in Vegas
All these hoes don't shake like you so all these hoes your haters
We could take it to the basics
Champagne and fuck faces
I'm the dude that ever like I'm in the grip and then tape us
I'm a dog baby, hold up baby
Please give me your all baby
You ain't never been with a freak like me
I'm a soak up all that sauce baby
You true as shit, you my down girl
Ass round, this my town girl
I bet this Chanel bag will upside down your frown girl
Shake it like you wasn't well fed
Why would you go elsewhere?
I'm a keep it 100, fuck me good and you get healthcare
Let me sample that bonbon, that gushy gushy bonbon
Scratch that, let me explode in that
Time bomb like...

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Never mind all these other bitches, baby you the best
I'm gon' throw all this money till I ain't got nothin' left
Take ya time with me baby, I want all that I can get
All of this is yours, but I just got one request

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
If you keep that shit 100 when can make little 'bove 100
Thousand dollars baby, girl it's all good with the bigger country
I'm a big boy, I don't play no games, girls I play with money
I got hoes lined on their pussies, said I hit 'em when I wouldn't
Say she say she down demandin,' why she all off in my sushi?
She so sexy, she so fine, just to meet her is a blessin'
Have your motor where your trunk is, s'posed to be the stupid question
Is it real or is it fake? They do you mine girl let me test ya
Pressure over bank row baby, dance it ain't no stress
You my dick standin' at attention like a fuckin' army bitch
Let me smash her half the night then she woke up and cooked me breakfast
I told her I wished I could stay but I gotta catch a flight to Texas

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Never mind all these other bitches, baby you the best
I'm gon' throw all this money till I ain't got nothin' left
Take ya time with me baby, I want all that I can get
All of this is yours, but I just got one request

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)

[Verse 3: Verse Simmonds]
Don't it feel good to know you got fans?
Waitin' on you girl 'cause you bad
Something like the main attraction, yeah
You the one, the one
Girl let's get a little personal, don't take it personal
But you a bad bitch, I just had to let you know
But I'm on it, goddamn
I want it so bad
For tonight I thought that you likin' this
You be good whatever you like
Talkin' girl as we speak
Got the world at your feet
Go to school in Alabama
Every Monday, you be back in Atlanta
You don't really party, that's the money involved
Other than that, you get turned back home
You don't ever be around girls, less drama
Do something that you faked up with your mama
Along with all that ass you get all this cash

[Pre-Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Never mind all these other bitches, baby you the best
I'm gon' throw all this money till I ain't got nothin' left
Take ya time with me baby, I want all that I can get
All of this is yours, but I just got one request

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)
Shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that, shake that
(All of this is yours)
