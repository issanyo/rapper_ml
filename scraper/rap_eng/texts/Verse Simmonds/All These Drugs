[Intro]
All these drugs
All these drugs
All these drugs (that’s all this drug shit)
Oh, it’s Holiday season niggas
All these drugs

[Chorus]
All these drugs got these young niggas in here tripping
All these drugs got these bad bitches in here stripping
All these drugs got me up, up can’t got to sleep
All these drugs got the track jumping like trampoline
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs

[Verse1]
I’m on the drink, I’m on the lean
I’m out here killing, playing volleyball
Got your bitch on my team
She coming with me
She got the Molly and the same stuff
Stay there acting like you cash up
Since when you wanna get past this
Sauce out here and it’s crazy
I had her give me her bag
She will let me I might hang
These bitches don’t save the tab a damn
She stay there be killing that cash
I know what to do with that cash
She let me remove it too fast
She spent a hundred dollars on weed
Driving a car with no gas

[Chorus]
All these drugs got these young niggas in here tripping
All these drugs got these bad bitches in here stripping
All these drugs got me up, up can’t got to sleep
All these drugs got the track jumping like trampoline
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs

[Verse2]
Can’t pull in this bitch and I got Lambo in this bitch
If a nigga try my slum I’m calling Lambo in this bitch
We get active in this bitch, it ain’t no slacking in this bitch
We get active in this bitch, it ain’t no slacking in this bitch
I heard shawty want my sex I call her back in with the shit
Bitches will be on my wrist and I prefer them stripping grits
I prefer the freaky hoes that be with all that nasty shit
I prefer the freaky hoes that never try to damn commit
I just fucked a girl one time she hit the blunt and watched my whip
Wait -

[Chorus]
All these drugs got these young niggas in here tripping
All these drugs got these ratchet bitches in here stripping
All these drugs got me up, up can’t got to sleep
All these drugs got the track jumping like trampoline
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs

[Verse3]
All these drugs got these niggas tripping (all these drugs)
All these drugs got these bitches stripping (all these drugs)
Got the plug and I’m bout to flip it (all these drugs)
Pop it smoke it and we bout to sip it (all these drugs)
All these drugs, all these drugs got these niggas chilling
I only smoke 93 and the lean sipping
I got the sauce all on me and I’m flowing with it
And on that bitch shout to three
Come in sausage, hit the switch
Whoo! Every day is a [?] day
Feels like every day is a sausage day
So we’re slashing with Holiday
Used to catch me now I’m at they face
Couldn’t tell I’m younger tell I’m running
Sipping the lean I’m a fucking sing it
Tell my momma I want all this money

[Chorus]
All these drugs got these young niggas in here tripping
All these drugs got these bad bitches in here stripping
All these drugs got me up, up can’t got to sleep
All these drugs got the track jumping like trampoline
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
All these drugs, all these drugs, all these drugs
