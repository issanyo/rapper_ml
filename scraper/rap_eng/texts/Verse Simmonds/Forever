[Chorus: Ar'mon]
You ain't gotta question this
Shawty, I'ma always ride out
Even when we passionate
Shawty, I'm yours, your mine now
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever, forever), always (forever, forever, ay)
You can have all of mine
Baby, you can have all my time now
I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you're like a perfect diamond
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever), always (forever, forever)

[Verse 1: Ar'mon]
Baby, they don't shine like you
Baby, they don't shine like you
One in a million, you the goat
And I don't want nobody but you
Hidden treasure that I found ya
I'ma run it up with ya momma
I'ma take my time, slow grind ya
I'ma make sure these hoes never get out of line

[Pre-Chorus: Ar'mon]
Girl, you at the top of my list
Kissing both sets of your lips
Taste like honey, I must admit, yeah
Oh, girl, this thing is on fire
Your love be taking me higher
Look at the song you inspired

[Chorus: Ar'mon & Trey]
You ain't gotta question this
Shawty, I'ma always ride out
Even when we passionate
Shawty, I'm yours, your mine now
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever, forever), always (forever, forever, ay)
You can have all of mine
Baby, you can have all my time now
I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you're like a perfect diamond
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever), always (forever, forever)

[Verse 2: Trey]
Forever and ever
And ever and ever
We stronger, we storm through the weather
We building, we on a new level
I'm digging, you ain't talkin' shovels
Get closer to your plane or shuttle
I'm by your side any battle
And I don't even need a medal
You send me swinging
This a special kind of vibe it don't finish
Baby, tell me what you like, you gon' get it
Worth more than silver and gold
I'm never lettin' you go
Girl, I just thought you should know

[Chorus: Ar'mon & Trey]
You ain't gotta question this
Shawty, I'ma always ride out
Even when we passionate
Shawty, I'm yours, your mine now
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever, forever), always (forever, forever, ay)
You can have all of mine
Baby, you can have all my time now
I just wanna see you shine
Girl, you're like a perfect diamond
This is (forever), got me (forever)
Got you (forever), always (forever, forever)

[Outro: Trey]
This is, this is
Ooohhhh
