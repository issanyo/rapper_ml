[Verse Simmonds Speaking]

I know you like it when I talk that shit...
When sweet nothings become everything...
Yeah

[Verse 1]

Love me good, fuck me better
Baby, cause thats what we here for
Sloppy kisses make you wetter
Now tell me something that I dont know
Like show me where the spot is, Where you get the hottest
Girl thats where im tryna go
And we barely know each other well, so ask me what you wanna know...
This love won't make itself...baby we gotta make it
Just like a heart can't break itself, somebody else had to break it
Right now we ain't worried bout that, 'cause we came to have a good time
Came to have a good time...
