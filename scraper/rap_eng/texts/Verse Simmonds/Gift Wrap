Start touching my zipper
Messin' up her lipstick

Makin' a movie and rating it 'R'
Take you a hit and I make you a star
Rocketshipshawty we wake up on Mars

And she put it right in front of me
Shouldn't ate before I called her, I said

I rub it down like I'm trynna get some good luck
I feel you gassed up pussy like a wishing well
It's Chanel number 9 not that fishy smell

Hit you with that superman
Throw some po-po-pow's on it

Body talking your booty swing
Nice to meet ya with a handshake
Just hand cloud with a half eight
Take a hit of marijuana
And we most sip that whine
And baby girl just get to whining
Everything is perfect timing I will never kiss and tell ya
I don't know where else to find it
