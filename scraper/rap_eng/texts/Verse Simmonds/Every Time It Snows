[Intro]
Oh, ooh, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woah

[Hook]
Every time it snows it gets a little colder
Every time it snows it gets a little lonelier
Now that you're gone, I think I lost that fire
Every time it snows, every time it snow

[Verse 1]
Who wants to be alone?
Especially this time of year
If you make it home
It'll be the best thing to happen all year

[Pre-Hook]
T-T-Tongue kissin', grabbin' that ass, yeah
That's my present
All of that good lovin'
All of that good stuffin'
I ain't gettin'
Watchin' the neighbors
Reminds me of how we buzz
But they can never be us
I really need to see ya

[Hook]
Every time it snows it gets a little colder
Every time it snows it gets a little lonelier
Now that you're gone, I think I lost that fire
Every time it snows, every time it snow

[Verse 2]
I get to thinkin' 'bout me and you
I hate the questions 'bout how are you
I'm runnin' out of the things to say
I don't know what else that I can do
Even went and put a tree up
Hopin' it would cheer me up
It really ain't do too much
Just last year we was

[Pre-Hook]
T-T-Tongue kissin', grabbin' that ass, yeah
That's my present
All of that good lovin'
All of that good stuffin'
I ain't gettin'
Watchin' the neighbors
Reminds me of how we buzz
But they can never be us
I really need to see ya

[Hook]
Every time it snows it gets a little colder
Every time it snows it gets a little lonelier
Now that you're gone, I think I lost that fire
Every time it snows, every time it snow
