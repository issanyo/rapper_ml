I need a girl to hold me down, down, down
I really need a girl to hold me down
Now, now, now
I really need a girl to hold me down
I never thought id stick around
Since you came around it's different now
Can you hold me down, down, down
I really need a girl to hold me down

[Verse 1]
A good girl and you loyal that's a plus for me
I could be the one, would be enough for me
Shotgun whipping in the ghost with me
I might burn a little bread, come make a toast with me
You never been the one I could doubt
Or ever have to question about
Won't listen to the word from their mouth
Don't you worry about a thing
'Cause as long as I got you, it's alright
Be and my [?] coming through now
Wait until tomorrow this is your life
[?]

[Chorus]
I need a girl to hold me down, down, down
I really need a girl to hold me down
Now, now, now
I really need a girl to hold me down
I never thought id stick around
Since you came around it's different now
Can you hold me down, down, down
I really need a girl to hold me down

Love me, love me give me motivation
When we talk get lost in conversation
Taking trips to the [?] we can change locations
Book a flight I'mma send a confirmation
I need a girl that will [?] the fancy things
Show my world just to give you everything
Now, now, now
I really wanna love you down
Long as I got you it's alright
If you hit my phone coming through right now
Don't wait until tomorrow this your life
Used to never be the guy to loved em
But right now

[Chorus]
I need a girl to hold me down, down, down
I really need a girl to hold me down
Now, now, now
I really need a girl to hold me down
I never thought id stick around
Since you came around it's different now
Can you hold me down, down, down
I really need a girl to hold me down

[Outro]
I love, love, love getting motivation
I need a girl to hold me down, down, down
I really need a girl to hold me down
Now, now, now
I really need a girl to hold me down
I never thought id stick around
Since you came around it's different now
Can you hold me down, down, down
I really need a girl to hold me down
Hold you down
