All of this motion (aww yeah)

All of this motion, all of this sweat
All of this motion (aww yeah)

All of this motion, all of this sweat
A river of a motion, you're soakin' wet
Shake it with ecstacy, lift it away
Now that we're floating, baby lets play

Cause I'll do anything to show that I love you
If you tell me that you want me my baby
Cause my mission is to please a pretty lady
And I dont care, baby I just want you...

One last time, do it to me one last time
Before you go (x4)

Love recognizes no barriers
It jumps hurdles, leaps fences
Penetrates walls to arrive at it's destination
Full of you. (Sunlight, Sunlight)

Speakin' in tongues, under your control
Tell me are you listening, to the sound of the soul
Cause it's the right place, the right time
I'm all yours, your all mine
And baby tonight, there'll be no wastin' time

Cause I'll do anything to show that I love you
If you tell me that you want me my baby
Cause my mission is to please a pretty lady
And I dont care, baby I just want you...

One last time, do it to me one last time
Before you go (x4)

Cause I'll do anything to show that I love you
If you tell me that you want me my baby
Cause my mission is to please a pretty lady
And I dont care, baby I just want you...

One last time, do it to me one last time
Before you go (x4)

Do it to me, ahAhh (x2)
