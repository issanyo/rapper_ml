[Intro]
Even diamonds can't make our love good
Somebody (?)
Preach

[Chorus]
You can't make yourself love somebody
Just like you can't help who you love
You can't make yourself love somebody
Just like you can't help who you love
You can't make yourself love somebody
Just like I can't help it

[Post-Chorus]
Comfortable
Think we got too comfortable
We were supposed to be untouchable
We was supposed to be the Huxtables
Fucked up
You got me, you got me
You got me all fucked up
You got me

[Verse 1]
And I know I fucked up
And I know I fucked up
Yeah it was all my fault
Should have been better to you
Let you into my thoughts
You was making time
I was focused on (?)
If I'm being honest
Could have given you more sex
I was on that bullshit
I was on that bullshit
Out all night with the liquor and the bullshit
A stripper and a whole zipper
Help me get lit, lit
Acting like nobody noticing me
Like ain't nobody stepping on photos of me
Forgive and forget
You was never really with that
See that one time, you never gonna forget that

[Chorus]
You can't make yourself love somebody
Just like you can't help who you love
You can't make yourself love somebody
Just like you can't help who you love
You can't make yourself love somebody
Just like I can't help it

[Post-Chorus]
Comfortable
Think we got too comfortable
We was 'sposed to be untouchable
We was 'sposed to be the Huxtables, yeah
Fucked up
You got me, you got me
You got me all fucked up
You got me

[Verse 2]
Yeah you got me fucked up
You thought that I would never ever notice
But I know you better than you know it
Least that you could do was keep it low-key
Why I hear about you in the lobby
You make the same face when you're lying
All this love shit looking ugly
Back to fucking bitches cause they love me
Ooh

[Bridge]
They say, they say
They say, they say, they say
You can't make yourself love somebody
They say, they say
They say, they say, they say
Just like you can't help who you love

[Outro]
You're just going to continue to not understand me
And we're just gonna get more and more angry
Cause we're already angry
So why
Why go there
Its all I was trying to say
You don't have to leave and be all dramatic
Its not like this is the first time you're saying that shit to me
(?) well if that's how you feel don't talk to me
No this is something that you continuously bring up
All the time
And I don't want-
Like that's in the back of my mind
Like you continuously bring that up
Like to the point that when I say this right now
You're, you're thinking see I was right
Like no
This is something completely different
I'm now saying this to you
Because you're not letting that shit go
So if you're not letting it go
Then maybe let this go
