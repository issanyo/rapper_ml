[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Love don't fail me, love don't fail me
If i feel good, we might gon' have on a baby
If it's really good, I just might take it to Vegas
If it's still good, than a bitch might gotcha' case for ya
And he be eatin' it up like a season
And i'll be kicking him out by the evenin'
Yeah, he gon' do what I want for the fiji
He trynna' tell me he don't, but he need me (come on)

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Turn it up, i wanna see it
Put it down, make you believe it (come on)
Poke it, rock it
Love you to pieces, love you to pieces (come on)
Turn it up, i wanna see it
Put it down, make you believe it (come on)
Poke it, rock it
Love you to pieces, love you to pieces (come on)

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Yeah, i can leave him hood, get him both knees for it
Make him crawl, make him beg, make him plead for it
Break the bake, and take all the currency for it
But my pussy, yeah, that's what i call a seat for
Look how i get low in the back (low in the back)
If i throw it at you, could you catch? (could you catch, come on)
And i heard that you a pro with the mat (with the mat)
If i give it to you, don't get attached (come on)

Love don't fail me, love don't fail me now (come on, come on)
Love don't fail me, love don't fail me now (come on, come on)

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Turn it up, i wanna see it
Put it down, make you believe it (come on)
Poke it, rock it
Love you to pieces, love you to pieces (come on)
Turn it up, i wanna see it
Put it down, make you believe it (come on)
Poke it, rock it
Love you to pieces, love you to pieces (come on)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
There's something between us
Is it love or lust (come on)
Sex in my car
Oh baby, buckle up (come on)
Callin' my name
Trapped in my chain (come on)
Succker for pain
Don't you ever change (come on)

Oh-Ah, oh-ah (come on, come on)
Oh-Ah, oh-ah (come on, come one)

Love don't fail me, love don't fail me now (come on, come on)

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea]
Turn it up, i wanna see it
Put it down, make you believe it (come on)
Poke it, rock it
Love you to pieces, love you to pieces (come on)
Turn it up, i wanna see it
Put it down, make you believe it (come on)
Poke it, rock it
Love you to pieces, love you to pieces (come on)
