[Hook]
Anything I would do it's so nice
Anything I would do it's so fine
Anything I would do that's mine
Anyway the things go, stars align
I just want to say thank you
But my heart says fuck you
But my brain says come through
I need you, I need you

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna spend time for real time
I don’t wanna know that you can lie
Keep convincing there’s no bye
State of mind, no tears to cry
We're killing shit like we're used to
Obligate and go on, that's my boo
Don't want get it killed, yeah, that's true
I might lose, I might lose
We mighta win, but who need that?
We know we're best, we ain't no sad
We search for the real ones
We search for the only
Looking for the better lovers, ain't got time
Looking for the better words to describe
Still in love, still in time
Still in everything and divine

[Hook]
Anything I would do it's so nice
Anything I would do it's so fine
Anything I would do that's mine
Anyway the things go, stars align
I just want to say thank you
But my heart says fuck you
But my brain says come through
I need you, I need you

[Verse 2]
Hopping the places like I am so high
Drunk and in love I don't feel the vibe
Coming my commas, I’m grammaring too
Percocet mollies, girl don't come through
We're riding and riding and riding so well
Putting up mamas inlight undertail
We turning so wild but it's in my dreams
If you not dramatic you turning your jeans
I feel freakest bitch hopped on the stage
Can i say that in my small age?
But where I am from, this is average
I don't wanna say bad ‘bout myself
But I want you to know how I felt
Every day when I’m dreaming bout you and him
I don't wanna lose time for sin

[Hook x2]
Anything I would do it's so nice
Anything I would do it's so fine
Anything I would do that's mine
Anyway the things go, stars align
I just want to say thank you
But my heart says fuck you
But my brain says come through
I need you I need you

[Outro]
How about to be good and rich?
All these hoes pour the cheapest peach
Need some punish ‘fore they would go and you never see their asses each
Man you should hold your suit and tie
I ain't baddest and you ain't fire
Catch some meat like a fucking hunter but you might feed wild with a liar
