[Verse 1]
On it, always want it, give it to her
Nasty, how I like it, like a pornstar
Foolish, got that good shit, talking good shit
Pussy, on a thousand, make me woozy
Flexing, no finessing, you the coldest
On it, shit you clone it, and you know this
Open, going deeper, you a keeper
Vibrate when you cumming, like a beeper
Feng shui, she love my feng shui, beat that 12 play
Okay, when I eat her, that's my entree
Soaking, keep the bed wet, how she like it
Focused, focused

[Hook]
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you

[Verse 2]
Bad bitch, you so bad bitch, break the mattress
Role play, she love to role play, she a actress
Smoking, beat that open, got the matches
Pass it, going round 2, talk mad shit
Saucy, I'm so saucy, work that magic
Bad bitch, in the city, you can have it
Hold it, baby hold it, you gon' catch it
Ride it, like I stole it, then I smash it
Stoner, she a stoner, meet me on one
Coma, in a coma, another one
Exhale, body language, know you feel me
Love me, love me

[Hook]
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
And she said, fuck you, goodnight I love you
