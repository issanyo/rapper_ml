[Verse 1]
(Woah)
Tell me what you think you looking at
(Oh)
So I think I'm Queen Elizabeth
(Now)
And now I'm stuck inside your memory
(So)
That's why it's so hard to get rid of me

[Pre-Chorus]
I am incredible, so unforgettable
So no one can take my place
I am unbreakable, highly flammable
So, girl, get outta my face
Oh, we got 'em going crazy
Maybe cause we're so amazing
Everybody in a daze
And that's the reason why they're hating
Treat us like some superstars
And only cause that's what we are
You know we going really far
And yall ain't even heard it all

[Chorus]
You hate cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem, uh huh
You hate cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
A pretty little problem, uh huh
You hate me cause I'm everything that you ever wanted to be
And I don't mind cause I love it when you're looking at me
Cause I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
I said that I'm a rockstar, a rockstar
Keep looking at me

[Verse Two]
(Wow)
It seems to me like I was bothering
(How)
Cause I make walking look like modelling
(Wow)
It ain't my fault the boys keep following
(Now)
If you were better, he wouldn't be wandering

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We're Prima J, you know it
We're not afraid to show it
We hold the crown and that's why they can't stop us now
The ground we're on is golden
They can't fix what's not broken
Don't act like yall don't know what's 'bout to happen now

[Chorus x2]

Why don't you take a picture
It lasts longer
