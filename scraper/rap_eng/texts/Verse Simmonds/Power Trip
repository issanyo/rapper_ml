[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Got me up all night
Looking at your body baby
Got me up all night
Spending all of this money baby
Got me up all night
Got me up all night
Got me up all night
All night

[Verse: Verse Simmonds]
Look at you baby
Look at you, look at you
The way your body moving
Whatcha do, whatcha do
The way you go down that pole
Whoah whoah, whoah whoah
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love
All this money in my thousand dollar pockets
Champagne bottles just keep on popping
The DJ's calling all the girls to the stage
And the strobe light's making me feel some type of way
Must be the drugs
I'm guwoped up, she down to cut
And I'm paying that, I don't usually
She know the name, she like the fame
This VVS society
And she high as fuck
Oh and I think she wanna fuck
Yeah yeah yeah

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Got me up all night
Looking at your body baby
Got me up all night
Spending all of this money baby
Got me up all night
Got me up all night
Got me up all night
All night

[Outro: Verse Simmonds]
Look at you baby
Look at you, look at you
The way your body moving
Whatcha do, whatcha do
The way you go down that pole
Whoah whoah, whoah whoah
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love
