[Verse 1]
As soon as I hit the streets
People won’t look out for me
I'm trying to live it at the modest
Not the typical thing that you see
When I'm moving fast
I camouflage
Getting tied up in the high seat
I got my own
I can't be cloned
Imma set the tone
In the darkest hour
You won't see no stars like this
No one's raising the bar like this
And if you doubt it
Put a mile in
Send them round
Asking if they know me yeah yeah
Sometimes I just wanna be alone

[Chorus]
Two cents you can keep the change
Penny for your thoughts
Imma stay the same
Try to poke at me, on the go
Wanna catch you slippin on em like a game
Tell em I'm the man ordinary
Extraordinary guess now you know
Restaurants just the talk about me, go on, talk about me cause as long as it’s show

Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Somebody feign, make a mess, so shallow
Take a chance on me like a hallow
Oh yeah
Yeah
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Somebody feign, make a mess, so shallow
Take a chance on me like a hallow
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Fans on fans
Taking pictures all day
Brought to the crib
People in my driveway
All these new faces man I don't know yeah
Got me up and down like a roller coaster
I've been on the road
Gettin to the money
What you want me to do
Told me
Walk in my shoes
Life chose me
I ain't have to choose

[Chorus]
Two cents you can keep the change
Penny for your thoughts
Imma stay the same
Try to poke at me, on the go
Wanna catch you slippin on em like a game
Tell em I'm the man ordinary
We extraordinary guess now you know
Restaurants just the talk about me, go on, talk about me cause as long as it’s show
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Somebody feign, make a mess, so shallow
Take a chance on me like a hallow
Oh yeah
Yeah

[Bridge]
这是命运 你和我都懂
别找借口 不需要理由
别说太多 你和我都懂
我的命运 我自己掌控

[Chorus]
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Somebody feign, make a mess, so shallow
Take a chance on me like a hallow
Oh yeah
Yeah
Truth can be a tough pill to swallow
Somebody feign, make a mess, so shallow
Take a chance on me like a hallow
Oh yeah
