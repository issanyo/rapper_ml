If you're a single lady, let me buy you a round
Let me buy you a round, let me buy you a round
Girl I like your face but I love your bana
I just want to get to know you better, what's your number
You're standing over here, looking all lonely
Come and take a sip of Nuvo and Patron
I can get you what you want, work that, work that
I can give you what you want, work that, work that
If you came with your girlfriends, maybe we can be friends
Do this every weekend
If you're a single lady, let me buy you a round
Let me buy you a round, let me buy you a round
If you're a single lady, let me buy you a round
Let me buy you a round, let me buy you a round
So we can get to the kissing and the hugging
So we can get to the touching and the loving
So we can get to the ooh and the ahh
Now baby girl, we can do it all night
Up, Up, Up and Down, Up and Down
Up, Up and Down, up & down
Up, Up, Up and Down, Up and Down
Up, Up and Down, up & down
If you don't wanna have fun, baby why you come for
Put it in reverse and let me pull up to your bumper
Baby you're too fine to be standing here alone
Baby you're too fine to be standing on your own
I can get you what you want, work that, work that
I can give you what you want, work that, work that
I know you came with your girlfriends, maybe we can be friends
Do this every weekend
If you're a single lady, let me buy you a round
Let me buy you a round, let me buy you a round
If you're a single lady, let me buy you a round
Let me buy you a round, let me buy you a round
So we can get to the kissing and the hugging
So we can get to the touching and the loving
So we can get to the ooh and the ahh
And baby girl, we can do it all night
Up, Up, Up and Down, Up and Down
Up, Up and Down, up & down
Up, Up, Up and Down, Up and Down
Up, Up and Down, up & down
You know I'm trapping with that line
What's you name, what's you sign
Like a Ciroc and Lemonade, I just creep in from behind
And if you're trying to get away, tell me what you got in mind
You can leave your whip, baby you can hop in mine
And tell them other cats, it's too late, they're out of time
Fuck you man, out of sight, out of mind
You remind me of my six-six drop
You smell good like?
I wanna lace you in yellow ice lemon drops
Mucho Dinero, the money don't stop
Round after round, the drinks don't stop
Treat tonight like it's new year, the bottles gon pop
So we can get to the kissing and the hugging
So we can get to the touching and the loving
So we can get to the ooh and the ahh
And baby girl, we can do it all night
Up, Up, Up and Down, Up and Down
Up, Up and Down, up & down
Up, Up, Up and Down, Up and Down
Up, Up and Down, up & down
If you're a single lady, let me buy you a round
Let me buy you a round, let me buy you a round
If you're a single lady, let me buy you a round
Let me buy you a round, let me buy you a round
So we can get to the kissing and the hugging
So we can get to the touching and the loving
So we can get to the ooh and the ahh
And baby girl, we can do it all night
Up, Up, Up and Down, Up and Down
Up, Up and Down, up & down
Up, Up, Up and Down, Up and Down
Up, Up and Down, up & down
