[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
It's not a day that goes by (ahhhhhh)
That i dont wanna look in your eye (ahhhhhh)
Girl you so fine, I might try (ahhhhhh)
To fuck around and lick you dry (ahhhhhh)
It's not a day that goes by (ahhhhhh)
That i dont wanna look in your eye (ahhhhhh)
Girl you know you got that fye (ahhhhhh)
If you dont give it to me ill die (ahhhhhh)


[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
She so fine it'll make you cry
Make you smile, even make you lie
Make me cum and i dont know why
Got me acting dumb and i don't know why
Some say I'm sprung and I'm young
And im dumb, full of cum
I'm a fiend, you the drug
I'm high
Baby so fly, Ain’t nothing I won’t buy
Baby drive
I'm too drunk to drive
Sliding down Ocean Drive
Driving a Lambo like New Jersey Drive
There's two freaks inside
Pull up in a Coastal suicide
I propose a toast
Got a bitch so bad i wanna boast
"Bae lets get sum to smoke"
Everywhere i go my youngin wanna go
She wanna go
The hoes with the most from coast to coast
A whole brick just a host
Baby lets elope
I buy you a stone bigger than a cantaloupe
Girl you dope as cancer smoke
And i think ima overdose


[Hook]



[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'll be a lie, if didn't say that you fly
And i ain't lying
Louie carrier, carry on bag
When we flying
I'm supplying all this shit im buying
I can keep you high
Private jet, I'm passing Kush out to the pilot when we fly
Ferrari jet, you my copilot when i wanna drive
I do the Driving, then you do the riding
Lets take a ride
You got that wet wet
That water slide, and i wanna slide
We smoking jet fuel
The Kush came in darker this time
In Ya Spine
And hit from behind
And damage the linen
And she came and i came in
That's perfect time
That pussy wet, man its too wet
It got me sliding
I'm a vet
Got a a mean chick
But shawty riding
