[Verse 1: Chill Rob G]
My word's food for thought, the mind is like a cafeteria
Some rappers are inferior, but none are superior
My voice is choice, I'm one of the chosen
I might be Chill, but I'm not frozen
Self-preservation, survival of the better
Chill Rob plus the seventh letter
Flyin' off at every angle, can you tangle
Mix or handle, you don't hold a candle
To what you're hearin', you don't have a near win
But it's a clear miss, no wonder you fear this
And don't get pissed just because I riffed
I'll tell you what, smoke this:
I'm the Future Shock...

[Verse 2: Chill Rob G]
The man, the moment, the mic, the muscle
The power, the people, the hype, the hustle
The harder I hit, the smarter you get
If you're a liar, stay away 'cause I ain't shovellin' shit
The edge of night opens doorways to horror
I'm the guiding light as you search for tomorrow
Dark shadows terrorize the young and restless
I'll crash the spot if I'm not on the guest list
The hands of time in my mind advances fast
While you recite the first to the last
Word that I spoke, but no, that's no complaint
Take my rhyme but use restraint
If I catch you on the perpetratin' tip, hurtin' your lip
Well look, you know how it is, I gotta flip
In ways you would never suspect
Like do a front semi and land on your neck
To be precise, correct and exact
This album is mostly freestyle and feedback
From the people, it's the sequel
To 'Dope Rhymes', but this is go for broke time
Without breakin', makin' no mistakes and
Takin' no flakes for friends, 'cause in the end
They backbite, and you don't wanna get smacked, right?
So hold tight while your mind takes flight
Check out a verse or two and see if I can rock
I'm the Future Shock...

[Verse 3: Chill Rob G]
Nothin' better to do, so I'll persue this new
Style, rhythm rockin' and poppin' lip
Jealous punks pretend it ain't hype but in
Ten lines or less they're jockin' it
Reality is my beat, the beat goes on
Mark creates the beat that Rob rolls on
Like a musical note or a boat ridin' a wave
And I hope what I wrote goes with you to your grave
Save a little for later so I can come back
My lyrics stick in your brain like a thumbtack
And if you thought I was slummin', wrong
You know that I'm comin' strong
This is a Flavorized drum track
So take a stand and plan to upraise your hand
When you agree what I'm speakin' is purely truth
I rap the style of rhyme that opens up your mind
To the way things have been since my youth
Why am I riffin'? Just listen and see if I can rock
While you bebop to breaks I drop
I'm the Future Shock
