[Intro]
The name is Chill Rob

[Verse 1: Chill Rob G]
I leave the competition open like sliding doors
If I could draw - it would be the Art of War
You could see my aura [?] above the floor
It's ice blue light ice [?] when sun lights through
I came to you to break through the debut
I rhyme better than they do so [?]
I'm the new model Benz and you's a [?]
Life is hard [?] and I break tooth
I pray I never need to pop a nigga
From trying stop a nigga from copping these niggas
Rock with more vigour, plot the gold diggers
Still make tapes to escape the day's rigours
I'm like Bush, you don't need to push me
Either do as I say or it's bombs away
I have you living under Murphy's law
Now let me show you how to shock and awe
It's like

[Hook: Chill Rob G]
Dope, face it, shoot it, freebase it
Pour it in a glass, drink it, chase it then
Chill, flex, feel the full effect
The impact is similar to a train wreck

[Verse 2: Chill Rob G]
Sharp and accurate, hard as blackest pitch
Thirsty as Dracula'll get, you gonna get smacked and kicked
If you don't get out the face of me and bow out gracefully
Rather do that than face the heat or face defeat or face the beat
Your life is cheap, now take a seat
I'm coming from the old school, so cool
No rules apply in the fast life, got shot and [?] then die
Foolish pride make me think I can rule the sky
Throwing rocks at planes when they crusing by
Now bring your A game game face, whatever sport
Metaphors'll help your cause or take the loss
I break you off, toss your naked corpse
They call me Chill
Of course they'll be some frost across your windshield
How your chin feel? Flow so cold, it'll make your skin peel

[Hook: Chill Rob G]
The impact is similar to a train wreck
The mic to my mouth to... to make your mind grow
The impact is similar to a train wreck
The name is Rob G, you just can't bilk me

[Verse 3: Chill Rob G]
Am I a semi? A semi? Or a pseudo?
Say this flipping these tracks but I'm black belt in Judo
Play this if the memories of the losers that you know
They missed, you either quick or you dead homie, you too slow
Say this about the [?] I never hear, I don't get into trouble
I make it hot around my enemies, I skin the bubble
Go 'head, get into huddle
You standing in the puddle of your own blood and your sweat
Cut your [?]
Belligerent, arrogant and inteligent
I blow spots like I'm a Middle East militant
Hurting y'all when I answer the curtain call
I flirt with gal, checking under your skirt and all
First of all you done found the worst of all
I burst your bubble, your ball, you're first of all
Venomous verses, generous curses
Live and loud 'til the crowd disperses like

[Hook: Chill Rob G]
Dope, face it, shoot it, freebase it
Pour it in a glass, drink it, chase it then
Chill, flex, feel the full effect
The impact is similar to a train wreck
The impact is similar to a train wreck
The mic to my mouth to... to make your mind grow
The impact is similar to a train wreck
The name is Rob G, you just can't bilk me
