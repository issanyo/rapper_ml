[Verse 1]
I'm dope, face it, shoot it, freebase it
Pour it in a glass, drink it, chase it then
Chill, flex, feel the full effect
The impact is similar to a train wreck
It's wack to me when the beat is more hype than the MC
'Cause what he's sayin is empty
Dull, void, without substance or content
You need to slow your speed, stop the nonsense
These are the words of the risin' sun, surprisin' some
Who thought I was just another hum-drum?
Average type non-MC
Who found a mic and thought he was hype
Nah, that's not me
I'll take a page, write a phrase, then rephrase it
Treat it like a national flag and upraise it
So a nation of people can feel proud
About a brother who speaks out real loud
I'm here to rock the show
Clock the dough
And let the words flow

[Verse 2]
Enough tough talk, as a hunter I must stalk
So each day I prey on ducks that like to play
Lame games to frame the self-same troop
Then guide em off the stoop and help them to recoup
Stone cold back biters bold wack rhyme writers
Give your little party and now you don't know nobody
Diabolical fools pursuin' happiness
Likin' finesse I'm left unimpressed
I heard you rhyme a few times, each time you blew it
You're soft, you can't go off, I knew it
Let's be realistic, I'm not egotistic
But you, your crew, just not that artistic
Point blank your song stank
Yo, I know you want the truth, so let's be frank
I been upstartin' this art, not known for bein' subtle
Patiently I listen to all types of rebuttal
"Don't say this, don't say that, change your lyrics"
Everybody's a critic, it's gettin' kinda hectic
My rhyme is authentic so it shall remain
My writin' exciting, never mundane
In actuality my personality
Keeps my mentality based on real
Life situations, not speculations
But verbal illustrations of how I feel
You have the audacity to doubt my veracity
Or to insinuate the G will prevaricate
Your disposition is beyond my recognition
I fail to see the reason for your constant disbelievin'
Why should I lie? What would I gain? Nothin'
So when I speak, yo, I don't be bluffin'
I be puffin' on high-powered cess blunts
I don't try to front
Or back away from a challenge, I'm game
You suckers rhymin' sound like your lips are lame
You seem to need therapy for you speech impediment
Take this advice because it's for your own benefit
I'm energetic, magnetic, and athletic
One more thing, and it's called poetic
My style is unorthodox, but of course it rocks
And when it comes to styles I'm over-stocked
You might never get to hear my last rhyme
'Cause I been writin since you heard me last time
I could go on,t he G is strong
I rock the show, I clock the dough
And let the words flow
