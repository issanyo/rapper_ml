I've got the power
I've got the power

[Verse 1]
"Don't say this, don't say that change your lyrics"
Everybody's a critic - it's gettin' kinda hectic
My rhyme is authentic, so it shall remain
My writing exciting, never mundane
In actuality my personality
Keeps my mentality based on real
Life situations, not speculations
But verbal illustrations of how I feel

[Verse 2]
Dull, void, without substance or content
You need to slow your speed, stop the nonsense
These are the words of the risin' sun, surprisin' some
Who thought I was just another hum-drum?
I'll take a page, write a phrase, then rephrase it
Treat it like a national flag and upraise it
So a nation of people can feel proud
About a brother who speaks out real loud

I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power

It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic

[Verse 3]
Dull, void, without substance or content
You need to slow your speed, stop the nonsense
These are the words of the risin' sun, surprisin' some
Who thought I was just another hum-drum?
I'll take a page, write a phrase, then rephrase it
Treat it like a national flag and upraise it
So a nation of people can feel proud
About a brother who speaks out real loud

I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power

It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin', it's gettin', it's gettin' kinda hectic

[Verse 4]
