What is life, what is competition
What is Rob but a true musician
What are new jacks lacking, facts, but new edition
Instead of the editor of fat rhyme classics
Now I'm some trick bastard who needs his ass kicked
They play me like a vic, who should be home raising kids
Instead of running across the stage screaming "There it is"
I try to check my rage, act my age
Keep the personal shit off the stage, it's impossible
There's lots of bull, Hip Hop is full of bullshit artists
Offer nothing but crap, and keep their pockets full
The world is full of round holes these are square pegs
With rhyme skills about as sharp as a boiled egg
I lay you flat on your back get the best of y'all
I've got the fat that kills quicker than cholesterol
It's heart-stopping, chart-topping
How could you say you're hot shit, you're not even bird dropping

[Hook]
Do you like what I do when I do what I do
It feel funky to me, is it funky for you
True, true, I'm still banging, eff you
Now tell me what you plan to do, let me know something

I go from night until day
Creams scorching them playthings badly
Ready to kill when you mistake the Chill for Milton Bradley
Darker brother than a Parker Brother, chain-smoking rappers
Before I'm through with you I'm gonna spark another
You want sweet, see Willy Wonka, I'm tougher than Tonka
The way I roll they say I'm out of control
Violent, screaming, with my ears steaming, spinning like a demon
I'm harder to hold back than semen
Silent, deadly when I'm creeping
I'm worse than Freddy Krueger cause I'm real
I'll get you while you're sleeping
I ain't never been a fan of yours
If I make you listen check it twice, I'm like an evil Santa Claus
And I ain't bringing no gifts and toys
I got a bag full of hard times, black eyes, and mad noise
Recognize what I'm saying, before we get you
There ain't nobody from Chilltown playing with you

[Hook]
