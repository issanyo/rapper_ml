[Intro]
Fire all lazers
Like to bust- bust- bust with my trusty bastard blaster

[Verse 1]
I rip the fat beats while wack fleas take back seats
Leave thirteen inch prints on backs with my black feet
[?] swift kick in the pants
If you call the tomb you better know the dance
Advance to the inner circle and don't make me hurt you
I still got mad issues that I'm tryin' to work through
My virtue is virtually vanished
And that's reality [?]
Punks are prone to panic, that's technicality but
I rip the fat beats while wack fleas take back seats
Leave thirteen inch prints on backs with my black feet
The heat that I generate is prone to penetrate through
Bones I damage straight through [?] and aggravate ya
Very last nerve with my very fast [?]
I'm like [?] I have the very last word
You's a nerd, do the [?], you deserve to be heard
Or grilled or flamb√©ed, I demand to be paid for my [?]

[Hook]
Get up on the mic
Get up on the mic
Get up on the mic
Get up on the mic and start to recite

[Verse 2]
Since you expect me to check mics correctly
I smoothly move through these opponents like Jet Li
On [?], some get charged [?] strongly
Some drink 'til they pants pee
Some just quit, some just bleed
I see your future and you gonna need a shock absorber
Funky as toilet water, they oughta call me slaughter
I see my future and for me it's looking bright as ever
And I got Midas treasure, I'm feelin' light as feathers
But you can't [?] me with a tractor or a team of horses
Could be as Jesus, make me [?] all these [?]
Yeah, I know who the boss is
You just go count your losses
I'm like a doctor without benefit of college courses
I rip the fat beats while wack fleas take back seats
Leave thirteen inch prints on backs with my black feet
I rip the fat beats while wack fleas take back seats
Leave thirteen inch prints on backs with my black feet

[Hook]
Get up on the mic
Get up on the mic
Get up on the mic
Get up on the mic and start to recite

[Verse 3]
We bring the bass that may shake your [?]
Reduce these weak dudes, I'm sour as [?] juice
And just as potent, I'll crush you like Odin
My content is constant, bombardment, opponent
What opponent? What is opposition?
I see no competiton when focused on my position
You wishin' on a slaughter
Follow where we are, but you'll never fill my shoes
It can only bring you doom
Crush you dudes in twos and threes, I [?] please
I don't let 'em leave and I don't let 'em breathe
You must be thinkin' of another version, better me
But I'm the bad Rob, the one that hack [?]
Work long hours for low pay for fat slob
You may remember me
You may pretend to be fan or a friend
But it's just a waste of energy
'Cause I rip fat beats while wack fleas take back seats
Leave thirteen inch prints on backs with my black feet
I rip fat beats while wack fleas take back seats
Leave thirteen inch prints on backs with my black feet
