[Verse 1]
Here's a prognotion, stop the commotion, I'll have my dose in
We cruisin', the beat and bruisin', you need coaxin'
Fluid as I do it, the motion is similar to the ocean
Bringin' waves of emotion
This feelin', that I'm dealin', is so appealin'
It's shockin', look how I got you rockin' and reelin'
My ripple and rhythm is reminicent of a river when it's pourin'
The King is reignin', I'm pourin'
This music, yeah he can use it, but don't abuse it
Move it, you said you were a dancer, prove it
I was full of powerful percussion get you rushin' on line
When it's 45 King time
Master of the Game, marks his fame, Mark's his name
The 45 King is the self same
Man who made the music that matched with the lesson
When I said "Court is in Session"
Feel it, ride the rhythm

[Verse 2]
Rhythms, I can get paid just for ridin' 'em
Suckers seem to be afraid cause I'm slidin' 'em
Ridin' 'em, cold dividin' 'em when I cut 'em up
Hit 'em with speed, they don't know who, why, when, where, what
Word is weird when your song is wrong
On the strength, I go the length, 'cause I'm long and strong
Freedom of choice lets me greet 'em with a forceful voice
So they know, I ain't no oreo
I'm solid, all the way through, what's up with you?
My cup runneth over, here's a drop or two
Rob is a roller, a writer, a schooler
And when it comes to gold then I'm a jewler
Feel it, ride the rhythm

[Verse 3]
My rhyme collection's under protection so now I'm flexin'
We rulin', that's how we coolin', and how we plexin'
What'll we do next, you'll probably never guess
Flavor Unit MC's are the cleverest
I'm sleek, think on my feet, rock to a beat
In my brain, I'm not insane, and never weak
When you're ready to rock to raw rhythms, reach for my record
This I perfected, and you can check it
Listen, I'm in position, to start dissin'
Instead I use my head to stay fed
Never starvin' Masterchargin' past the margin
Whatever price you paid, it was a bargain
Freedom is priceless, knowledge is twice that
That goes for everybody, Latin, white, black
Depends on who you are and how you livin'
But in the meantime, just ride the rhythm

[Verse 4]
Muscleheads on a mission cold be wishin' they been flippin'
This passion, I'm not askin', I'm just whippin'
I'm real, and I'm the deal, now how you feel?
You beg, borrow, or steal, you got appeal
Step off, get lost, or get tossed
Like a salad, your rhyme has no value
An invalid waste of breath, a taste of death is all that's left
When I get these rhymes off my chest
Indeed, I have exceeded, what you expected
You know that I'm dope, but can you accept it?
There's no doubt about the clout that I rap
To make sure everything turns out
Perfect, as close as we can work it, to perfection
Fly girls, they give me an erection
Plexin', somethin' that I do with the Flavor U
By the way, that's my family, too
Feel it, ride the rhythm
