[Intro: Sample]
Of course excellence of this order doesn't come overnight

[Intro: Chill Rob G]
Yeah, there's a lot of these cats, man
Lot of cats, you know what I mean?
New cats, old cats; doesn't really matter
Everybody wanna be the best
Everybody wanna be the best

[Verse 1: Chill Rob G]
Been doin' this since my teen years
One of the greatest orators you have ever seen here
When I tell you to fall back, I mean rear
When I tell you these dudes shook, I mean fear
Starin' at me like you ain't sure to seein' clear
Catch me on occasion like blue moons or green beer
Older and colder, the boulder holder will mold ya
Break ya and make ya into something more than a faker
Rappers be yappin' 'bout all that of the gats they cappin'
'Til I catch 'em and zap 'em
They wonder what the hell happened
A wonder drug to cure all your mind's ills
Superthug for sure, callin' on rhyme skills
I am the proof: talent is never temporary
I am the truth and the plauge on my adversaries
Test me at your peril, I keep a razor sterile
Beware of the Chill one
Technique is thorough
I said the technique is thorough
You know the technique is thorough

[Hook]
Tell 'em who the fuck I am
Chill Rob G
I'm simply top notch
Tell 'em who the fuck I am
The name is Chill Rob
I'm simply top notch

[Verse 2: R.A the Rugged Man]
Yo, yo, yo
When I bust the dust you [?]
I wanna tongue spit it
I done did it, you done quit it
I'm hitting the sluts, guts 'til the hunt shitted
You bullshittin', bitch you ain't never come with it
I first hit it with the record label suck di-dick
The same time Holyfield forfeited
Is it invigorating when you wiggle your little weigh?
Let me pick up, you disobeying
What is it you saying? Is it an enemy or a friend
You say you didn't betray 'em
Kick 'em like kid and play
I'm leaving your liver laying
And the gun spit bullet holes hitting above ya
Like Rob G name on the Ride the Rhythm cover
Rip the contract with the goal to combat
Handcuff my arm back, falling on contact
Played the name game with the same lame
Bang banging your brain when I'm bringing the nightmares
Like game Dane, it's a shame you ain't maintaining the game
Claim you rain, bringing the pain
I'm ripping you out the frame like
Now I'm sittin' in the courtroom all day
I claim I'm innocent, but that's what they all say
Rob tell 'em

[Hook]
Tell 'em who the fuck I am
Chill Rob G
I'm simply top notch
Tell 'em who the fuck I am
The name is Chill Rob
I'm simply top notch

[Verse 3: Chill Rob G]
But I might make your mind grow
Whether I spit speed, these bars are rhymed slow
It really doesn't matter yo
Don't let me stop you from checkin' out the data though
That's if you wanna know
Me? I just wanna flow
So, if you wanna go, it's called freestyle, you better bring dough (yeah)
I'm one negro to avoid when annoyed (word)
I'm not responsible for what's destroyed
I'm told that I can be a real hemorrhoid when blasting little bastards out into a void
Kinda like Freud, except my analysis 'cause calluses and mental keloids
But don't be alarmed, 'cause rap is an art
I came to take these rappers apart (yup)
Hard to separate the smell from a fart
Just kill 'em all and make a fresh start
Try to tell 'em

[Hook]
Tell 'em who the fuck I am
Chill Rob G
I'm simply top notch
Tell 'em who the fuck I am
The name is Chill Rob
I'm simply top notch
