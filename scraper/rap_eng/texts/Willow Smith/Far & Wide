Yeah I’ve been searching far and wide
To try to find something worth my time
And you’re so nice,
Yeah you’re so nice to me


Yeah I’ve been searching far and wide
To try to find something worth my time
And I’m so dead inside, I cry
But it’s alright,
Yeah it’s alright


I’ve been searching far and wide
To try to figure out my mind
And I’m quite stumped
Yeah I’m quite stumped tonight
