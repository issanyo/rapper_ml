[Intro: Post Malone & Jaden Smith]
Oh, whoa (oh-oh)
Oh, whoa (nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
Oh, whoa (oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
I just, can I, I just, I just, can I (oh, oh, oh)
I just, can I, I just, I just (oh, oh, oh)
Can I, I just
I just want to see you (damn)
Something I can see through, baby (man)
You make my dreams come true
Can I, can I, I just

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Aw, yeah, I just, ayy
Baby, can I come and see you?
I just, I just, ayy, girl, you seem always on the move
Baby, I just cannot, uh, figure out what to do
And I just, I just, uh, cannot let you go on your own
Ayy, why you got to be so inconsiderate wit' it?
Know that you mean more than any one of these bitches
It's like you wanna see me go and hop off some bridges, ayy
Emo Posty woulda gone and cut up his wrists, ayy
Instead, I'm going to drop a hundred bands on a whip, ayy
Only way I know to get my brain off of shit, ayy
I just want to see you, maybe talk about shit, ayy
I just want to see ya, you might feel for the kid

[Bridge: Post Malone]
It's you that I have been searching for
Just let me know what's good with y'all
Can't keep on going back and forth
Won't let you, won't let you, ayy

[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Post Malone]
I just, I just (woo, skrrt)
I just want to see you, damn (damn, skrrt)
Something I can see through, baby (yup, skrrt)
You're making my dreams come true, whoa, yeah, oh, yeah
Can I, can I, 'cause I just want to see you (man, man, hey, hey)
Something I can see through, baby (woo)
You make my dreams come true (whoa, yeah, oh, yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Jaden Smith]
I just, can I, I just, I just
Can I come and see you?
I just, something I can see through, baby
I just, make my dreams come true, whoa, yeah, oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Jaden Smith]
You're walking alone, you're walking alone
I hate when you walk, at least talk on the phone
There's some creeps in this zone, you said, "Joker, shut up, I should know how to walk"
I come from the Bronx, I said, "Baby, it's cool, you know I like your talk"
We keepin' it cool, we keepin' it, keep it

[Chorus: Jaden Smith & Post Malone]
I just, I just (woo, skrrt)
I just want to see you, damn (damn, skrrt)
Something I can see through, baby (yeah, man, skrrt)
You're making my dreams come true, whoa, yeah, oh, yeah
Can I, can I, 'cause I just want to see you (man, man, hey)
Something I can see through, baby
You make my dreams come true, whoa, yeah, oh, yeah

[Outro: Post Malone & Jaden Smith]
(Whoa, yeah, oh, yeah)
I'ma never be alone
(Whoa, yeah, oh, yeah)
(Whoa, yeah, oh, yeah)
I'ma never be alone
When you're walkin' down the road
