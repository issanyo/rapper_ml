[Verse 1]
I know you've been cutting ties, you've been telling lies
I know you don't know the time, it's all up in your mind
But I can't get with it, no
I can't get with it, no
Won't get a whiff of that sickness

[Chorus]
You say you wanna fly, that's alright
Gotta buckle up, better hold on tight
Gotta get in your right side of mind
Get in your right side of mind
If you're tryna fly
Better hold on, hold on tight
Get in your right side of mind
Get in your right side of mind
If you're tryna fly

[Verse 2]
Human spend so much time tryna figure out life
Tryin' to classify wrong and right
Better hold on, hold on, tight
It's gonna be a bumpy ride, it's gonna be a bumpy ride
Full of lies and pasttimes
Full of lights and endless nights
You don't feel your merkabah spin
Just try again and again, just try and again like
I try again and again
I try again and again
I try again and again
I try again and again

[Chorus]
You say you wanna fly, that's alright
Gotta buckle up, better hold on tight
Gotta get in your right side of mind
Get in your right side of mind
If you're tryna fly
Better hold on, hold on tight
Get in your right side of mind
Get in your right side of mind
If you're tryna fly

[Bridge]
Circles, circles, elipses
Trees and flowers, breeze and grass and laughs
She's drawing
Circles, circles, elipses
Trees and flowers, breeze and grass and laughs
Straight lines, he's running out of time
Trying to get from A to B, from he to she
Straight lines, he's running out of time
Trying to get from A to B to eternity

[Chorus]
You say you wanna fly, that's alright
Gotta buckle up, better hold on tight
Gotta get in your right side of mind
Get in your right side of mind
If you're tryna fly
Better hold on, hold on tight
Get in your right side of mind
Get in your right side of mind
If you're tryna fly

[Outro]
Get in your right side
If you're tryna fly, tell me, tell me if you're tryna fly
To your right side of mind
To your right side of mind
To your right side of mind
