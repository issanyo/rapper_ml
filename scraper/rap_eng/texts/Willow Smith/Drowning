Feat. Mecca Kalani
[ Mecca ]
Do you wanna hear a love story?
Well, once upon a time, there was a guy...

[ Willow ]
All she ever did was pick at the scars that he left her
On her heart

And she bleed reliving the sweet words in terrible hurr
She gave him her heart
And so did he
But when we ripped the cord between his heart and hers
She fell to her knees in disbelief

And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean
She loved him, she was drowning
He drowned her in her sorrows
But he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love

Blue eyes, red lips, pale skin

[ Mecca ]
He left her (He left her)
Standing in the middle of the street
Yes he left her (Yes he left her)
And she cried out so desperately
And he dropped her
As she fell into his trap, she can never let go of that
But he caught her ( Yes he caught her)
And as soon as she got up
He pushed her away

And she was drowning in the middle of his ocean ( She was drowning)
She loved him, she was drowning ( Drowning)
He drowned her in her sorrows
But he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love

[ Willow ]
I dropped a tear in the ocean
And the day that you find it ill stop loving you, loving you

[ Mecca ]
He's eyes stung me with trude
But he's word fed me Lies
And by that time she was...

[ Willow ]
Drowning...
In the middle of his ocean
She loves him
She was drowning...
He drowned her in her sorrows
Cause he's scared to love another
But he drowned her
And he's staring at her body in the river of eternal love

And thats it
