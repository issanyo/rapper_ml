Romance doesn't exist
It's a hoax to trick your mind into thinking perfection exists
Or absence of suffering
Stop leading girls to the clouds above
It's so distracting
We can focus on self-love

Morality doesn't exist
It's a construct we breed into children who see
We create our paradigms
We create all our lives
Ancient biology
Evolving psychology
Is all here in this moment

I want to know you like I know myself
But it would be just as confusing and hell
I'm imagining a different history

Imagine us in a field
Feasting on mountains that stretch very high
With the sky is the color of bruises and cuts
Oozing and bleeding all over the Sun

Slowly, your hand caressing my thigh
Slowly, your eyes connecting with mine
Oooh ahhh ohhh
Lays me gingerly on my back
The foliage consumes me
I'll never make it back to this moment
To this moment, to this moment
To this moment

I want to know you like I know myself
But it would be just as confusing and hell
I'm imagining a different history

Where man and women stay equal
In the eyes of society
Where we don't condemn different people
For exercising their freedom
Where sex stays sacred
And an act of divine love
And not perverted into violence and lust
Where we still honor our mother
In all of her burgeoning light
Where we do not kill our brothers
Or rape our sisters
Or enslave any life
