[Verse 1: Willow]

I wanna make it easy
I wanna keep the peace
I don't want control
I just wanna live my free
You and me, babe
You and me, babe
A garden of Eden
An ocean of sharks
Tell me how you feel and, baby you have my heart

[ Pre-Chorus]

I hear the estates in Calabasas is real nice
Lets stay for a night
You and me, babe

[Chorus]
( you and me, you and me, you and me, you and me)
You and Me, babe

[Verse 2: Willow]
I wanna make it easy
I wanna keep the peace
I don't want control
I just wanna live my free
You and me, babe
You and me, babe
A garden of Eden
An ocean of sharks
Tell me how you feel and, baby you have my heart

I hear the estates in Calabasas is real nice
Lets stay for a night
You and me, babe

[Chorus]
( you and me, you and me, you and me, you and me)
You and Me, babe

[Bridge]

Climbing on the trees
Then they say we rugrats
We just do what we please
Drinking off of the streams
They don't like that
No, they don't that
They do not like us
They use blue-tailed lighters
