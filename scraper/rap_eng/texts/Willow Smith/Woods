By myself, in the woods
Just the sound of the distant water and Erykah Badu
Just the scent, just a word
The vibrations you're sending baby they're not good
Just a scent, oh, just a smell
Ohh, just a feeling
Ohh, I can't help it now
Creativity in veins
The multiplicity, it speaks to me in my brain

Alone in the woods
Nothing else but the sound of water and Erykah Badu
Just a taste
Mmm just a taste
Just a peek of the higher state of the higher state of being
