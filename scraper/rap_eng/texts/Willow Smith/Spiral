I dip my big toe in the salt water
I am feeling quite great
Feeling like i want to fly away
These people they don't understand
All of these stars
They be talking and they saying things
To us all
And if you ignore them
If you ignore them you'll be in a downward spiral
You'll be in a downward spiral
Trap in my disease
Nothing's ever alright
So we prove to them that we can change All of this with our lives
It's alright
Yeah it's alright
We'll shine our lights
You holding me and it's sorcery
And I open up and I tell you things
We're spiralling and it's time consuming
What you do to me
People they don't understand
All of these stars
They be talking and they saying things
To us all
And if you ignore them
If you ignore them you'll be in a downward spiral
You'll be in a downward spiral
