I don't see you in the forest no more
I yearn for you, but you're so far away in your tree home
I'm by the obelisk, come and just sneak a kiss
All aboard the machine and berserkers running after him
Vesicas running through the wind

Eywa meuianga’

Mother Earth, we praise your light
Your sisters and brothers
We commune with you
Your sisters and brothers
We just love in you

All the natives of the windy forest
Come hither
All the natives of the windy forest
All the natives of the windy forest
Feel the music soaking in your pores
Feel the music soaking in your pores
The forest children are making songs
And trying to get you to sing along
