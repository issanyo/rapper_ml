[Verse 1: Dev Hynes]
Credit card and my time’s up
Mum told me put my pants up
Essex been my birthplace and they told me to be first place
But I (but I)
Sometimes I fall for the shit that betrays me
And the shit that betrays me is the shit I see lately
You know I will never go home
My [?] would just stay [?]
Despite all the love you receive
It still makes it harder to grieve
Better chose someone to emphasize your faith
And let them chose your problematic case to make

[Hook]
You won’t sit next to me
You won’t sit next to me
He won’t sit next to me

[Verse 2: Tyler Cole]
Static adjacent
You were not there when you knew I was up in the attic still manic complacent
I was attacked but the panic align
A man patience, waiting, for the sunset
Cause we’re in love and the world is ending
You don’t care
Don’t you dare pretend
I’m scared enough
I am staring up
Asking what the world has to offer us
Cause I’m born in the city they shot up the club
Torn between breathing and lying and love
And I am [?]
Cause I was a child
That knew that he wouldn’t encompass directions
So scared of affection
Cat Power vinyl, I’m singing our blessings
Look in the void and I ask all my questions
Stare in the void and I’ll ask all my questions

[Hook]
You won’t sit next to me
You won’t sit next to me
You won’t sit next to me
You won’t sit next to me
He won’t sit next to me
You won’t sit next to me

Falling away from you heart take it back to you [?]
Falling
What does it mean if nothing they say it’s true
[Alone?]
Falling
Find a path for yourself

You say she's basic
I say she’s just too intelligent to be intimidated by what's making others be shit
Fuck all this [?] shit

Never could have been [?]
Oh-Uh

Seven’s down and the nine’s up
Obama said the crime rate’s up
Thinking back to our first day
It's like how'd I get here in the first place

Sometimes I fall for the shit that betrays me
And the shit that betrays me is the shit I see daily
You know I will never go home
Everything’s truthful except my apology
Hold on to the unknown
Double entendre, consoling the fallen
You told me to leave you alone
What if I gave you a flower and sonnet and got a new car
The’s highly ironic
Cause you won’t sit next to me

Oh the rise and the fall
Sigh and I call
[?]
That’s all I need to know
Oh
I need to know

Find a path for yourself
Ssh
