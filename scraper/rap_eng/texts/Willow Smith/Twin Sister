Rising tides, crashing skies, everyone cries
'Cause we are, 'cause we are...
The universe pretending to be individuals
Everyone hurts

So follow me, we can climb on trees just breathe

I never really met you, but I see you cross the room
Never really meant to get crazy but I do
There's no way I can stop it, there's no way I can block it

If I ignore it, pushing down the eye of Horus
Suppression seeping out my pores
I guess I crack open some doors
And we all agree,
I guess she done killed somebody (Done killed somebody)

She tried those hobbies, and she slacked and slacked and slacked and slacked
And went home and was slapped and slapped and slapped
And now what? Now what?

Have you seen my twin sister, she was walking down the street
Have you seen my twin sister, she was gonna go meet a friend, she told me and our parents

I see her from my periphery
She looks so pretty
But she's on top of a building
But she's on top of a building
She mouths I'm sorry then jumps off soaring

The universe pretending to be individuals
Everyone hurts
So follow me, we can climb on trees just breathe

Oh, my twin sister
Walked home and went with her
My twin sister
