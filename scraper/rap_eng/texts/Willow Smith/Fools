I'm a fool for you
Yes I am
I’m a fool for you
I want your poison
Oh, You think I planned this

Spend the week at the beach
Had some time away
Now we're in your truck
Trying to play a track
Before the sun comes up
Spend the week at the beach
Had some time away
Now you're in my thoughts
Trying to make me fall even more in love

I probably
Just hesitated
Now it’s all too late to call
I could've, I could've
Just let you in

Turning off the lime light
Can't see past it
Hurting in the quiet life
The carefree passion
Don't expect a lot of smooth talk
I'm a fool for you

Spend the week at the beach
Had some time away
Now we're in your truck
Trying to play a track
Before the sun comes up
Spend the week at the beach
Had some time away
Now you're in my thoughts
Trying to make me fall even more in love

I probably
Just hesitated
Now it’s all too late to call
I could’ve, I could've
Just let you in

Paintings of us
Hanging above
Hating in love
Claim that the change can’t
But we're still creating in love
[?]
You had your time; thought it was enough
When we tried to talk; wasn't enough
You've been on my mind
Since we made the wave form
And the waves form
And I know that you know you hurt me
And I know just how much I hurt you
But I think all the things that words do
Is take away from the fact I heard you
That’s a euphemism
For the good intentions
I have learned my lessons
Babe, you're professor
I'm the monologue
I said ,"I'm logging off"
I thought I was a tool
But I'm a laughing stock
You slap me off
And the passion's there
But the action's not
We have come to a happy stance
Okay, let's have our last dance
Told me hit the beach
It's freezing jeans
But it's my last chance
I know you fill the gap in
And I know that's why it happened
And we're laughing
I'm hesitating
Oh you're on my cadence
Know you feel amazing
That's an understatement
Stimulate my brain
Before I play the fool
And I paint the picture
That I said was hanging

Paint the picture
