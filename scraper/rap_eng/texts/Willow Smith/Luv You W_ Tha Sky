I know
You feel my soul
Yeah, I know
Yeah, I know
And you call me [?]
While I'm gone
Up in the stars
Looking at some planets and I'm not coming home

We know what we need
Less brainwashing in magazines
We know what we need
Less brain washing, less brain washing

We know what we need
Less brainwashing in magazines
We know what we need
Less brain washing, less brain washing

The left brain is watching you
And the right brain is watching you too
Harmony supposed to be
What I love and strive to get to

But what happens when the road is turned
What happens when your love is burned
Right in front of your eyes
And your life, is on fire

Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
But how is this supposed to be?
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?
But how is this supposed to be?

You, you, you make me feel
Like a celestial goddess
You, you make me feel, feel

You, you, you make me feel
Like a celestial goddess
You, you make me feel, feel

I feel your heartbeat
And I guess you're feeling my heart too
Yah, I feel your heartbeat
And I'm feeling like I'm liking you
Yah, I feel your heartbeat
And I guess you're feeling my heart too
Yah, I think you like me
And you know I'm really liking you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you

I wanna hold you at night
I wanna love you with the sky
I never see you at night
I fell in love with the sky
When he calls my name
I wave and say Hi, Hi

Love you with the sky
I hope that you are alright
Love you with the sky
I hope that you are alright
Love you with the sky
