[Verse 1]
So, um
Take the money, take the fame
All I want is truth
You talk their language, play their games
Act as they want to
Look at you, look at you
Who are you? Who are you?

[Verse 2]
You walk the streets aimlessly
The density is rain
The thoughts you think just cause you pain
And don't make you more free
What to do? Woe is you
What to do? Who are you?

[Verse 3]
You criticize behind those eyes
No hatred, you're just jealous
Your subconscious is not conscious
To poison your ingestin'
Woe is you Who are you?
It's your choice, just make the move

[Hook]
Burning bridges, burning bridges
Posies all fall down
Now consciousness is all there is
And nothingness as well
What are we? What to see?
My third eye is opening
I'm burning bridges, burning bridges
Posies all fall down
Are consciousness is all that is
But nothingness is well

[Verse 4]
What are we and who are you?
Did we just go down the drain?
And I just go with my flow
Cause rollin' circles, rollin' circles, rollin' circles
The pavement seems too cold
And now my feet turn purple
(Hey, Willow? What?)

[Verse 5]
Take the money, take the fame
All I want is truth
You talk their language, play their games
Did you forget 'bout who you were?
In the stars
Lets go back home
This Earth is hard
This Earth is all up in the stars
The Ursa's hungry
He's just lookin' for a brotha to get started

[Outro]
Burning bridges, burning bridges
We just fallin' down
Our consciousness is nothingness
And nothingness is well
Who are you?
Who am I? Who am I?
Where is me? Where is I?
There's no "I"
It's just all

It's just all, it's just all, it's just all.....
You don't have to [?]
