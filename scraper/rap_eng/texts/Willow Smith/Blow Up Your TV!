[Intro: Tyler Cole + Willow Smith]
Ohhh oh oh ohhh oh oh [repeat]

[Verse 1: Tyler Cole]
Waiting for the moment I break free
All alone and I'm pacing
I'm not hiding at all, there's crying involved
The lying and hating, all the people we don't know
That's a problem, we don't grow as a people at all
I can't see you at all
But I know that you're suffering, our computers are buffering
And the media fucks things, lets get rid of it all
I'm sick of it all, there's an answer here

[Chorus]
We need to blow up our TVs
Gotta grow up and be clean
All your memories gone, memories gone
Honestly we need to blow up our TVs
Gotta grow up and see things
I love you all, I mean I hate you all
This is honesty

[Verse 2: Tyler Cole]
Waiting for the moment I let go
Wish I did from the get go
But I'm too insecure your face is a blur
And they steal all my content, I try to be content
They lie when they consent
I die in this song in the eyes of the law
I'm below all the nice things, there's never a right thing
Barely trust all you right wings
The media's bought, and the television is destroying us

[Chorus]
We need to blow up our TVs
Gotta grow up and be clean
All your memories gone, memories gone
Honestly we need to blow up our TVs
Gotta grow up and see things
I love you all, I mean I hate you all
This is honesty

[Verse 3: Tyler Cole]
Blow up your tv
There's no love in these screens so
I know I know I know I know you like your show
But you can't see that it won't come with no cost (it will come with no cost)
I hope I hope you like to go outside
'Cause honestly the media will dumb you brainwashed (dumb you brainwashed)
It's real it's real it's real I tell ya everybody's looking for something that they understand (you don't understand)
I feel I feel I feel so strong emotions 'cause you don't know till it's happened to you first hand
So blow up your tv
There's no love in these screens so
