[Verse 1: Willow Smith]

Today I'm feeling lazy, babe
Today I'm feeling blue
And you and you and you can call me crazy
But you crashed your car.. i guess you're wong
For the first time i'm feeling alive
We make the grand escape, lets be killers babe

[Chorus]
Toes in the grass...
I'm really feelin' your sound
Like a ghost when she said 'i'm never comin' around'
'im never comin' around, i'm just really feelin' your sound'

[Verse 2: Willow Smith]

When the sun goes down
The sea becomes a lady
She hits herself onto the shore
There's no-one there to save her but me
I'm her savior
See, i just flush all her waves
Take all her anger while it gets later
So very later
The stars they make up all thats living
And you can't reach her when you're winning

[Pre-Chorus]
She responds to vulnerability
And she knows we've got abilities
So she tries to bring it out to me
She brings it out in me

(anger)
(later)

Darap darap darap darap darap
Darap darap darap darap darap
Darap darap darap darap darap

[Chorus]
Toes in the grass...
I'm really feelin' your sound
Like a ghost when she said 'i'm never comin' around'
(never comin', never comin')
'im never comin' around, i'm just really feelin' your sound'
