It's unfortunate that when we feel a stone
We can roll ourselves over 'cause we're uncomfortable
Oh well, the devil makes us sin
But we like it when we're spinning in his grip

Love is like a sin, my love
For the ones that feel it the most
Look at her with her eyes like a flame
She will love you like a fly will never love you again

No, no, no
Or she will love you or she won't ove you
But what can you do?
(No)

It's un, it's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate

It's un, it's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate

It's un, it's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate

It's un, it's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate

It's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate

It's unfortunate that when we feel a stone
We can roll ourselves over when we're uncomfortable
Oh well, well
The devil makes us sin
But we like it when we're spinning in his grip

No, no, no
Don't say you love me
If you don't love me
Don't say you need me
(No)

Love is like a sin, my love
For the one that feels it the most
Look at her with a smile like a flame
She will love you like a fly will never love you again

It's un, it's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate

It's un, it's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate

It's un, it's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate

It's un, it's unfortunate
It's un, it's unfortunate
It's unfortunate
