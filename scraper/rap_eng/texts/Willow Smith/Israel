Your eyes like caramel in the sky
Dripping down my moon
Your smile like the wind
I only met you once
But how do I begin?

The Kong Lung market and your flower of life t-shirt
Ah-ah Ah-ah
You said you'd fallen and just how much it hurts
Ah-ah Ah-ah
So you blew the clouds and you walked around
Asked Pele to take you away from me
A guy pulled a knife and life will suffice
Then fell asleep under the Noni tree

Oh, Anna shared her soup with you
Oh, Anna her eyes were so blue
Oh, Anna can you tell me how he touched you?
Oh, Anna the phoenix on your back rose and flew (away)

The Kong Lung market and your flower of life t-shirt
(Away away away away away away away away away)
Your caramel eyes and signature sly smirk

(Away away away away away away away away away)
So you smoked the ice and you dodged the knife
Those kids kept on fooling you

You asked to die but you stayed alive
And got lost in Anna's eyes
Oh, Israel, please finish your story
Israel, why won't you just hold me again?
(Away away away away away away away away away)
Please finish your story
Israel
Why won't you just hold me again?
(Away away away away away away away away away)
