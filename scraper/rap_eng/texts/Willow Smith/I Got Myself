[Verse 1]
I got myself a family and I got myself a dog
Got myself a [?] and she's like my second mom
Got myself a guitar so I can play a song
One minute I'm happy, the next I'm gone
Got myself some friends, I don't see 'em that much
Got myself a [?] and we talk social issues
Got myself to Lana and I love it when she talks
One minute I'm chill, the next I'm lost
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah

[Verse 2]
Got myself an ocean and I got myself a sky
Got myself some fishies and I got myself some time
Got myself a something but I don't know what it is
Got myself a mouth so I can talk that shit
Oh, I got myself
I got myself a mind, it tells me what to do sometimes
Got myself a light that I carry in my eyes at all times
I got myself some feet so I can walk on Earth

[Bridge]
One minute I'm crying
One minute I learn, learn, learn
One minute I learn, learn
One minute I learn, I learn
One minute I learn
But I'm sure, I'm sure these things get worse

[Outro]
Ooh, I got myself (I got myself an ocean and I got myself a sky, I got myself somebody and I got myself some time)
Ooh, I got myself, oh (I got myself a something but I don't know what it is, I got myself a mouth so I can talk that shit)
Ooh, I got myself (I dont need nobody tryna double check my ego I don't need nobody tryna tell me I'm a G though)
Ooh, I got myself (I already know because my heart speaks heartbeats, I already know because I see these, see these things)
