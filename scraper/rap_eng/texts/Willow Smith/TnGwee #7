[Tyler Cole]
How could you leave me in a place where I'm a refugee
How are you breathing when your face is blank as memories
You must've forgotten my minds erased
Now you considered it enemy
Love is forgotten when you're picking cotton
And nobody here is a friend to me
You're all alone
And you try [?]
You're all alone
Inside [?]

[Willow]
Nobody here is a friend to me
Nobody here is my enemy
Nobody here is a friend to me
Nobody here is my enemy

[Tyler Cole]
And no one, is there, to care
To care

[Willow]
To be loved and
To love is all that is
But what is this I do not know
But what is this, you steal my soul
Fairy tales
They do come true, they do come true
But [?], you have to slay the dragon
I thought I would get my kiss now
I'm still fighting
You're all alone
And you try [?]
You're all alone
Inside [?]

[Tyler Cole]
Nobody here is a friend to me
Nobody here is my enemy
You are not [?]
I am not here [?]

[Tyler and Willow]
You're all, you're all, you need
You're light
