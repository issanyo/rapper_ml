Come with me, climb some trees
Come with me and you will see
Come with me, climb some trees
Come with me and you will see

No one can teach you to see
No one can teach you to breathe
To see the beauty in you
To see the beauty in trees
To see the beauty of who you always wanted to be (no)
Just ride with me, ride with me
Just fly with me, fly with me
To see the beauty in life
To see the beauty in strife
To see the beauty in space
Astral project and just fly

It actually scares me, scares me
It actually scares me, scares me
Imagine being alone in space
Passing by planets and passing by Pleiadians

I'm radiating life
I'm radiating life

Come with me, climb some trees
Come with me and you will see
Come with me, climb some trees
Come with me and you will see
Yes, you will see

Climb some trees, climb some trees
Climb some trees and you will see
Meet some plants, meet some plants
Come with me and you will
Dance! Dance! (We will dance)
Dance! Dance! (Together, together, forever, forever)
Come with me, meet some plants
Climb some trees, and we will dance!
