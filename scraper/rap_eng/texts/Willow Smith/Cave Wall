Magic, vibrations like magic
Some of us can't handle it
But that don't mean we can't

So paint me in black
Oh, on your cave wall
I wanna know I have your respect
I wanna know I have undivided attention

We are stuck in the fake idea
We connect rifles and thought out wars
That's how we get power
It's all force
We all know, we all know

So paint me in ash
On your cave wall
I wanna know you realize your light
I wanna know you observe your life
We all know, we all know
