[Verse 1]
Wait a minute!
I think I left my conscience on your front door step
Wait a minute!
I think I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension
But I'm here right now, right now
Just sitting in a cloud, oh wow
I'm here right now, right now with you, oh wow, oh wow
I don't even care
Run my hands through your hair
You wanna run your fingers through mine
But my dreads too thick and that's alright

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute!
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute!
I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
You left your diary at my house
And I read those pages, you really love me, baby
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said "Oel ngati kameie"

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute!
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute!
I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Some people like to live
Some just tryin' to get by
Some people I can't hurt
Some just rather say goodbye, bye

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute!
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute!
I left my consciousness in the 6th dimension
Left my soul in his vision
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it, oh, oh
Let's go get it
