Now when I take off my shades
Please don't be shocked by my age
I'm taking over the game
Now will I scare you, will I scare you?
Boo!

My parents left me home alone
They left me home alone
It's time to pick up the phone
And tell my friends come on!

Somebody bring me along
You betta bring me along
Can follow me in my dramas
Let's blow the speakers off!

I can feel it
Feel the drums takin' over control
I feel it deep in my soul
Can you feel it?
Feel this feel, that's what you are in my zone
Now watch me rock it out

I make the rockstars and the popstars
Wanna do it like
Wanna, wanna, wanna do it like me, like me
All you rockstars and topstars
Wanna do it like
Don't you wanna do it like me?

Now, watch out, I break it down
You know I'm not new in town
Go low on your speakers now
Will I scare you, will I scare you?
Boo!

Now, everybody hands in the air
Now, keep em up in the air
Now, wave em like you don't care
We bout to set it up!

Haters scream on the top of your lungs
Until your tonsils get numb
The way I rock on the song
Will make you shout it out

I can feel it
Feel the drums takin' over control
I feel it deep in my soul
Can you feel it?
Feel this feel, that's what you are in my zone
Now watch me rock it out

I make the rockstars and the popstars
Wanna do it like
Wanna wanna wanna do it like me, like me
All you rockstars and topstars
Wanna do it like
Don't you wanna do it like me?

Now, I just wanna let my hair down
Let my hair down, rock it out
Make you people scream and shout
Now watch me while I wall it out
Now, I just wanna let my hair down
Let my hair down, rock it out
Make you people scream and shout
Watch me while I wall it...

I make the rockstars and the popstars
Wanna do it like
Wanna wanna wanna do it like me, like me
All you rockstars and topstars
Wanna do it like
Don't you wanna do it like me?

I can feel it
Feel the drums takin' over control
I feel it deep in my soul
Can you feel it?
Feel this feel, that's what you are in my zone
Now watch me rock it out
Watch me rock it out
Now watch me rock it out
Watch me rock it out
Now watch me rock it out
