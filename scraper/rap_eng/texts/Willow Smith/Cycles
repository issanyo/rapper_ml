[Verse 1]
Ain't tryna rock no boats
Ain't tryna step on no toes
Ain't tryna bust no bowls
But I'm just trying to get home

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause the moon is bright, the streets are dark
The kids and they're howling, they're howling
I walk the streets, trying to find a place to sit
A person to talk to
But all I have is you, this ghost inside my brain

[Chorus]
I'm lost in the light
I'm feeling really bright
I don't wanna spend the night
I just want a cool breeze, warm stream while we're looking at the trees
I'm howling, I'm howling
Lost in the night
I really wanna cry
I don't sleep at night
I'm going out with those kids, we're howling, we're howling

[Verse 2]
Kids, we do what is right
We do what is wrong
But what is right?
Please explain to me what is wrong
We do what we feel
We make our own path
Our path now
We're the indigo, we're the indigos and we're all going to another place
Not tryna find another name
Not tryna get in another body
I'm going to ascension, baby you cannot stop me
You cannot stop me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause the moon is bright, the streets are dark
The kids and they're howling, they're howling
I walk the streets, trying to find a place to sit
A person to talk to
But all I have is you, this ghost inside my brain

[Chorus]
I'm lost in the tide
I don't think I can get out
I'm swimming from that shark mouth
And that island of undal is really far away
I don't think I will make it at all

[Outro]
But I fall
With some Atlanteans, Nephilims, the Martians and some Anunnaki, we all fall
What happens when we fall?
We go down in consciousness and we rise into a life like
What the heck is happening?
Why am I here? Why can I sing?
Why am I across the seas? This is crazy
I wanna go home, I wanna go home
