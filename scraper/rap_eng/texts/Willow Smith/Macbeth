Tomorrow and tomorrow (and tomorrow)
Creeps in this penny pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time
And our yesterdays have lead fools the way to dusty death
Out (out) breathe candle
Life's but a walking shadow

Paranoid as ever but im feeling kinda clever like the better that your doing than the more im gone
Treat your guilty conscience face you [?] honesty that we've been tryna find and you've been missing out on
Please don't worry for me, for me
Its the time and time again you claim the family as your friend, right?
I guess we can make amends, right?
We can stop the men from fighting, wrong
And they're telling me I don't belong
Telling me I won't be wrong
Unless I choose to be a bar on the far left of the graph
With the left brain passing all the classes
Never living college lies
And thats forbidden knowledge for you
Tyler, you can go inside
Thats ok ill climb a mountain

Welcome to the land people die thats the only thing promised
Because now adays laws are so lawless
[?]
Leave it with the sad letter that you wrote me
Took the time
Had the hopes and dreams but glass has shattered
Tear a passion to tatters because you matter if you writing the play
But you're directing your life
You should have something to say
But somethings nothing today
You should have something to say

A poor plan thats struts and frets an hour upon the stage
And then is heard
It is a tale told by an idiot
Full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing

Lady Macbeth, oh
You're looking good in your dress
Lady Macbeth

Why do we choose to be fooled by the one that we love
By the one that we love
Why do we choose to be fooled by the one that we love
By the ones that we love

When you walk through the door and you see my eyes
You know what the time is get in your ride
We're jumping and we'll go to the skies
We've got people in the backseat tryna ride
