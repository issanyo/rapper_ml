There has to be a reason I'm alive
There has to be a reason that I'm crying
And as I walk these roads throughout my life
I find the subtle reasons

There has to be a reason I'm alive
I know there'll be a reason that I die
And as I walk these roads throughout my life
I find the subtle reasons

No heart
No no heart

You'll find your reason
You'll find your reason
You'll find a reason

Maybe there's no reason for existence
If so, we're all fishies in the ocean we call life
But I believe it doesn't til we make one
We create our own reason

Kill them all
Your thoughts won't help you anymore
Free your heart
It's the only thing that breaks but still can be taught
Love every day that comes into your life
It's just a test
Shed your skin
Realize that water and fire are just your kin

I know there is a reason I'm alive
I know there'll be a reason while I die
But as I walk this path throughout my life
Gratitude's a reason
Embrace the subtle reason
Make your own reason

Do you see this?
Are you scared?
Or you're angry based in fear
Do you want out easy way?
Well, okay, we'll just come again

Do you see this?
Are you scared?
Or you're angry based in fear
We all want out easy way
Well, okay, we'll just come again

And again and again and again
'Til we learn what we have to
Learn what we have to
And again and again
