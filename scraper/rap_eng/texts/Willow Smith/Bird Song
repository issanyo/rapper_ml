[Verse 1]
Love comes on cat's feet
It circles the corners
It sits by the window and whispers...
"Mine! All mine! all mine!"

[Brigde]
My arm fell asleep
And dreamt it was your arm
Hush lest we break the spell, oh well, oh well...

[Verse 2]
It's all so wrong
To greet the dawn
The birds sing that awful song saying
"You don't belong here!"

[Outro]
Love comes on cat's feet
It circles the corners
It sits by the window and whispers...
"Mine!"
