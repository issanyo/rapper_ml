[Hana Vu]
Looking down at the sea
I don't breed any breeze
You can be whatever you're not whatever you are
It's the same to me (same to me)

[Willow]
Sometimes I feel like a failure
Contrasted against the girl I want to be
All these familiar faces
Probably feel the exact same way as me
But let's see, see, see the exact same way as me
I probably should've warned you
I ain't nothing like they told you
They try to catagorize me
But you can be anything

[Hana Vu & Willow]
You can be the queen of high school
And all that brings
I don't mean to be so cruel
There's no need to forgive me

[Willow]
But if you want to that's fine
Let go and have a good time
Preferably at night that's right
Maybe we'll have a good kiss
Maybe we'll feel the abyss
And maybe look at the stars and we'll cry
'Cause everything that we know
Connects into a huge flow
That we can't comprehend and will lend
Our souls to those who connect
They'll enter Earth through sex
And will rest again

[Hana Vu & Willow]
'Cause, baby, did you know?
I really dig your soul
Yeah, baby, did you know?
Baby, did you know?
I really dig your soul
Baby, did you know?
