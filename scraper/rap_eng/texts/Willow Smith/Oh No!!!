[Intro]
Oh, no (x4)
Feeling like I'm falling
Oh, no (x4)
Why can't I control it?

Oh, no (x4)
Feeling like I'm falling
Oh, no (x4)
Why can't I control it?

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna break my heart
Because I know you won't do it first
Being in love is like suffocating
And I am drowning inside my own fakeness

Oh, baby just let me go
Oh, baby just let me go
I don't wanna cry no more, no more
I don't wanna cry no more (more)

[Verse 2]
Being in love is like a rollercoaster
Unbuckle my seat, please
While we're falling closer to the ground
Wanna see death in motion
Don't follow my lead, please
While I end this torture

Oh baby, just let me go, go
Oh baby, just let me go, go
Why can't I just let you go?
Let you go?
I can't, I just let you go

[Outro]
Oh, no (x4)
Feeling like I'm falling
Oh, no (x4)
Why can't I control it?
Oh, no (x4)
Feeling like I'm falling (more)
