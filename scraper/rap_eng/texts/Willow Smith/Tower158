Her lays his head on hims chest
Her falls asleep
Gracefully and peacefully as him sits at the edge of the tree house
Lookin' out at, the infinite abyss
She awakes they kiss, it's bliss
Our two lovers can't resist
These two lovers can't resist
This, love

This is just be romancin', and we steady dancin' and
I would buy a million roses but I can't this shit expensive
Baby understand I'm just tryna hold your hand

Barefoot and we layin' in the sand, girl we layin' in the sand
Maybe it's the freckles, maybe cause we had the ocean skippin all these pebbles
And all these rocks, lookin' for the cops
Cause what we got's illegal, we lookin' at the seagulls

Lifes so free when you live it at the beach
Girl you got some pretty feet
And now we at the treehouse chillin'
And I'm 'bout to make a killin'

You make my heart rush a steady beatin'
Steady beatin' and we creepin' cause its even

It's late, it's late even
Got me heavily breathin', got me fiendin' for your lips
Got me fiendin' for your lips

Tower 158, Tower 158
It's getting late and you said it's ok and I asked you to stay and you said it was late
Tower 158
