[Verse 1]
I think I'm coming undone
I think I'm getting started
Us humans we don't know one thing
About ourself or anything
And I for one know nothing
But you can tell me something
You can whisper something

You think I'm coming undone
You think I'm going crazy
Us humans we don't know one thing
About ourself or anything
And he for one knows everything
And she won't tell you nothing
She just sits their cuffing, no
Let's think about how we created this, oh
Let's think about how we let this happen, oh-oh-oh
We want our freedoms without responsibility
And we are so scared to see

[Chorus 1]
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different

[Verse 2]
We can run through the sun and forget this place
Fickle heart, fickle mind, you robbed me blind
You want to run, so let's run
You can run but you can't hide
My fickle mind, it's going blind
So you run to your roots
So you run to your roots
So you run to your roots

[Chorus 2]
(We're not so different, not so different, not so different, oh)
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
(We're not so different, not so different, not so different, oh)
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different

[Verse 3]
I'm independent, I stay on the beach, I roll with the seas
I'm not an investment, you have no control over me
Maybe I could say one thing, maybe
Maybe I could pretend like money grows on trees
But it does and that's the funny thing
The ironic thing, uh, the kind of scary thing
It all destroys for me, ah

[Chorus 2]
(We're not so different, not so different, not so different, oh)
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
(We're not so different, not so different, not so different, oh)
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
Oh, we're not so different
We're not so different
