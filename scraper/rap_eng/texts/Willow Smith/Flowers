[Verse 1]
You wished upon a star
Saw the mother snap back and now you're where you started
My heart aches when I see your face
That's the story of this life but my soul saw it twice
Never had a problem but my soul seems to fight through the artifice of life

[Hook]
But it's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out

[Hook]
But it's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out
But it's the flower

[Verse 2]
I wanna be an atlantean
Let's get the 10, let's get the 10 x 4
And we'll knock down the door, knock down the door
We'll see what they've been hiding
Let me tell you bout the story of Poseidon
He was a young boy who was enlightened, kinda like Jaden
Kinda like the way we, look in the sky and we see the chem trails
And we nearly all cried, and then they just die we merely just tried to help them
The government is tryna tryna sell them not help them
But, the indigos are here we remembered
Remembered how we can all shift the weather
Because, love is the air we breathe, the people we see
The realization that were all in unity
So you and me, and I and I
We're the flower

[Bridge]
We're the flower
We're the flower
We're the flower
It's  the flower
We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out

[Hook]
But it's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out
But it's the flower

(Just go, just go)

(We were walking on clouds but the greys came down and they wiped us all out, and we fell down, baby...)
