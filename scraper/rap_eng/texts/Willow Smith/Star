[Intro]
Earth, Our home
Incubator of life
Through our lines of life
Your recover the knowledge
Hidden with our bodies and earth, herself
To raise our brothers and sisters
To a new state of consciousness

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I move, you move
It's all the same we play these games
We play them, we don't think about it
Cause I'm done, I'm done
Trying to make it easier, make it easier
For you, because nature's a battle
And nobody ever handled it, the way our ancients did

[Chorus]
My universe
Just keeps on growin' and expandin'
But you are my star, you are the star
In my sky, I encompass your lights
I inhabit the divine, I

[Verse 2]
I finally got a piece of mind
And I'm holding on really tight
And time, time's, time's not waiting
For you and I, and I and I and I
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
That flight tonight
To the sky
Yea, I'm talkin' about a flight
Into the night, Into the night
Into the night

[Chorus]
My universe
Just keeps on growin' and expandin'
But you are my star, you are the star
In my sky, I encompass your lights
I inhabit the divine, I

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
My universe
Just keeps on growin' and expandin'
But you are my star, you are the star
In my sky, I encompass your lights
I inhabit the divine, I

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
