I am just a little girl walking in the forest
You're smiling wide, it's not alright
I am just a little girl, but I stand mighty
I feel the sunrise on my side
But I
See a tiny space in his eyes
It's very tucked away, it won't hide
I'm the heroin inside of the syringe
And I'm not going in
And I'm just a girl
Walking through the woods, but I'm mighty
I'ma climb this mountain
And ain't nobody gonna stop me
Not even you, not even you, oh, oh
Not even you, not even you, oh, oh
I know it is true, I know it is true

I am just a little girl walking in a forest
Got the crystals in the bag in my right hand
Vibration's rising so the molecule's porous
I can see straight through the trees with the touch of my hand
But I
Am just the molecules there inside
It's very far away, I won't hide
It's now a part of me, I'm not gonna cry
Not gonna cry, not gonna cry
I'm gonna climb, I'm gonna climb
In this tree, cause it's a fractal of me
Don't try to analyze the breeze
Akashic records in your teeth
That's why I'm surfing over reefs
That's why I'm sleeping under tepees
With my native culture
My hugs are warm and my words are colder

I am just a little girl walking through the forest
I am just a little girl walking through the forest
I am just a little girl walking through the forest
I am just a little girl
I'm sitting in the world
