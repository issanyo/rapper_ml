I sail the seas of you and me
Oceans of Blue, Oceans of me and you
And time and on the elephants, the moon it shines for you
Oceans of Blue, Oceans of Blue
Oceans of Blue(ooh)

I can feel you by my side, even when I know you're not there
I can't see you with my eyes, but I know you're always there
Ohh lurking, just lurking
In the shadows

I'm drifting in a place, I'm losing my grip on you
Not reality, but you're part of reality, and I'm part of reality
And we're created by eternity(ooh)

I told you to sail the ocean blue, with me
I told you to go, I told you to go!
To get on my life you would never see me no more(Never!)
You took a chance, you held my hand
And we transcended through 3rd dimension

I sail the seas of you and me
Oceans of Blue, Oceans of me and you
And time and on the elephants, the moon it shines for you(for you)
Oceans of Blue, Oceans of Blue(Blue, Blue)
Oceans of Blue(ooh)

I can feel you by my side, even when I know you're not there
I can't see you with my eyes, but I know you're always there
Ohh lurking, just lurking
In the shadows

I'm drifting in a place, I'm losing my grip on you
Not reality, but you're part of reality, and I'm part of reality
And we're created by eternity(ooh)

I told you to sail the ocean blue, with me
I told you to go, I told you to go!
To get on my life you would never see me no more(Never!)
You took a chance, you held my hand
And we transcended through 3rd dimension
