[Verse 1]
I wish I could sleep
It looks so peaceful
When i'm watching you
At night I can see
She's beatin', believin'
I'm grievin', not many reasons
So many seasons, oh
Will you stay with me
Until the earth runs dry
We'll tear it up, we'll tear it up

[Chorus]
Ice in our veins
Love in our still hearts
I'm not playin' games
And i'm not tryin' to go off
Ice in our veins
Love in our still hearts
We're just playin' games
And i'm not gonna  go on

[Verse 2]
But why not?
Just the thought
I don't want to sit here
In my doom all day
I won't stay, no
Stay, Stay, no

[Chorus]
Ice in our veins
Love in our still hearts
I'm just playin' games
And i'm not gonna go off
Ice in our veins
Love in our still hearts
We're just playin' games
And i'm not gonna  go on

[Outro]
Tonight, it's your fault that I'm this way
I go through all that pain
Just to be alone at the end of the day
At the end of the day
