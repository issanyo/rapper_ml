[Verse 1]
I've got two tattoos and I know love splits a person in two
We've been cruising in your jeep and it just puts me right to sleep
We argue, I'm not in the mood, I've got a mouth and an attitude
It's true, I love you

[Hook]
We stop for gas, we're feeling tired, we take the 10, I'm home by 9, I'm home by 9
We stop for gas, we're feeling tired, we take the 10, I'm home by 9, I'm home by 9
We stop for gas, we're feeling tired, we take the 10, I'm home by 9, I'm home by 9
We stop for gas, we're feeling tired, I blow some O's and he just drives

[Verse 2]
Now we're sitting coastal, sitting on the rocks when I [?]
And I hold your hand, wanna go home
And I'm leaving now
We've been sleeping at the beach this past week
And the waves put me right to sleep
On the ride you're feeling tired, leave it all to me, I'll drive
I've got tattoos and so do you
We share the pain we're living through

[Hook]
