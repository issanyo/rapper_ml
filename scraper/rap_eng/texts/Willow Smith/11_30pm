[Verse 1: dylAn]
She text me and told me to hurry
I checked my watch, it was 11:30
We in the temple sipping on a Shirley, ay
I like her maybe cause her hair was curly, hey
Or maybe it's cause of the freckles
Her cheeks, and her nose, and her dimples
Fell in love and it's so unofficial
I'm busting off, I'm not shooting a pistol
I like to kick it with them, duh-uh-uh
We can go to Erewhon, ay
Fuck around and walk up to the Lé Pain
Ay,  cuff her right next to my arm
Walking to the pond, later coming over
You can always cry up on my shoulder
Yeah, I know I'm getting older

[Outro]
It's been a minute since you called me back
(Been a minute since you called me back)
It's been a minute since you called me back
(It's been a minute since you called me back)
I threw my poems in the garbage they’re trash
I don't know, but I'll be kicking ass
I don't know why all the weed is ash
