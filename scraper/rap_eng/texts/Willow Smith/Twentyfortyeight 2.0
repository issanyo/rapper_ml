Um, I am kind of seeing a yellowish hue
Um, the shape is kind of nebulous
Um, I... it's warm
It definitely encompasses me in all that is
Um

And it feels like it's trying to tell me something
Maybe the pain we've brought our brothers and sisters
And that we've brought upon ourselves
Is it true to who we really are
We've manufactured a society that runs on the backs of those we choose to victimize
And that isn't genuine
That doesn't nurture the human soul
