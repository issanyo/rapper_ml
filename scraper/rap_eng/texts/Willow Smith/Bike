[Verse: dylAn]
Have you ever had brunch on a Sunday?
Ah, baby put your robe on
Come on baby girl, put some clothes on
We about to get our stroll on
Ever had soup with the wonton?
I be down for a falafel
Or I'll kick it at Lé Pain and get a waffle, hey
I be in the club without the bottles, hey
I be at the party with the models, hey
Or I'll be cruising in the Tesla, it's full throttle, hey, hey
Now if I said that I was Hancock
Would you go buy me some Stance socks
That'd be top notch, wearing drop crotch
And yeah, I can beatbox (buh-chika-buh-chik)
Yeah, the beat knocks, yeah
That's ¿Téo? and the D'artiste
I be chillin' in the fleece
And I kill it everyday when I'm in the streets
Have you seen this new MSFTS piece?
"Jeez!", when I'm in the streets
I be rocking a pair of Beats and I go freestyle on the beat, hey
I like the sandals on your feet, hey

[Outro: Willow Smith]
La, la, la—wind and rain
Can't stop me, I am on a roll now
And anyway—
I can get a taste of that higher beingness I will take
Live a little more, then I kush it down and I push it down
Told me I was friends, then you held me down
"But that's okay,  We're all the same, all the same"
Why you say that?
Because, wind and rain
La, la, la—wind and rain
