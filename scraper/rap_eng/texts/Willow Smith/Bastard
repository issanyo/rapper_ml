And now making his live debut, Basterd The Antichrist

I know that it hurt living alone, by yourself
Through the [?]
I know that it's hard being the one
Catching crates to see the trial
I know it ain't easy
I know that it's tough
But if you just stick with me
We can learn to love

And I'm not talking romance
I'm talking about real stuff
And if you just stick with me
We can learn, we can learn

We'll wake them up  (wake up, wake up, wake up)
We'll wake them up  (wake up, wake up, wake up)
Wake up!

And I know that it's a mask this person that you were
And I know it's a task trying to pretend like you care
And I know you're not perfect
I know I'm too tough
But if you just stick with me, we can learn to love
And I know that's not easy
And I know that's too tough
But if you just stick with me, we can both wake up
We both wake up

Wake them up  (wake up, wake up, wake up)
Wake up!
Wake them up  (wake up, wake up, wake up)

We'll make them see injustice
Make them see our pain
And because of this sickness, they will look away
Make them see our darkness
Make them see our truth
And if you just stick with me, we'll make them all see you
All see you

They'll all see
They'll all see
