[Spoken]
So, I walked into a liquor store
You know, to get a powerball ticket
And as I'm filling out my recurrent numbers
I see the most beautiful woman out of my peripheral
Only problem is she had a gun to my temple
I've never been so aroused

[Chorus]
Do you remember all your past lives?
Do you remember all my pastimes?
Why do I ask so many questions?
'Cause I ain't getting any answers
You got something
Not just the things that were placed right upon ya
I'm such a loner
Hotel is vacant
Alone and complacent
He's feeling indifferent
I'm restless and waiting
As we're riding morning nights are swerving in my web
California legalises Santa for the kids
Alimony ruining a real relationship
And the ceremony ends in all the suing of the master
Preaching to the pastor
Revving up the reverend
Judge, jury, executioner give me my sentence

[Verse]
I've done the crime
Let's run through time
And the sun inside
You shun the shine
Your world is mine
Your worlds a lie
And in the grand scheme
I'm an abandoned life
Think you're right
Tell me why your gods speaking to you in a room of light
Telling me your god can't tell me where I'm at
That I'll never be a prophet
Say you sitting in the comments room
With a cup of tea and your guilty conscience
Bet you're living all your lies out
Like a morning breeze while I'm paying homage
Yeah I'm blatant honestly a saviour
Offer you my prayer
Now you say I'm layered
Now I think you care
Now you have to stare
Heard of the game, assumed I was a player
I've been running on the other side
If you need a ride I can't help you out
Trying to make it through this water everywhere around me
But they say we in a drought
Peddle down the road
Peel the petals off the rose
Asking if she really love me
Level to this brother
I just wanna write the show
Asking if you really love me
Catastrophic and I panic
Lost her with a testimony about taking losses
I'm a [?] often
With a steak from [?]
This is Vegetime and I'm [?]
Waking later, now we're dazed
Like a game of stakes
Faker than cave laser in the Earth's core
That's another story
Al Gore was global allegory

[Chorus Pt. 1]
Do you remember all your past lives?
(What are you saying? Haha)
Do you remember all my pastimes?
Why do I ask so many questions?
'Cause I ain't getting any answers baby

[Spoken]
Have you ever been in love?
It's like sticking a knife in your gut
And twisting it slowly [?]
And for once in your life
Theres someone who needs you

[Chorus Pt. 2]
You got something
Not just the things that were placed right upon ya
I'm such a loner
Hotel is vacant
Alone and complacent
I'm lost in the world but I'm patiently waiting
As we're riding morning nights are swerving in my web
California legalises Santa for the kids
Alimony ruining a real relationship
And the ceremony ends with all the killing of the master
