How you feelin'?
How you feelin'?

I've been goin' all week doin' my class now
I'm just gettin' so weak
I'm just climbin' on trees and skippin' my class now
Don't place your blame on me

One and a two and a three, three, four
People knockin' at, knockin' at my door now
I don't want it to get bad

But let me tell you right now

I've been goin' all week doin' my class, tell you right now
Tell you right now

How you feelin'?
How you feelin'?

After I give you that amethyst crystal under your pillow now
How you feelin'?
I saw you walkin' down the hall
I knew it was you but my mouth didn't call
I thought that I wasn't the one that you wanted
Until I went onto your inspir and done it
I just done it

Let me tell you, tell you right now
I'll tell you right now

I've been climbin' in trees and jumpin' in creeks, tell you right now
Well tell you right now
