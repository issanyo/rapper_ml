Sister, can I tell you?
That I've been so sad
Like I'm grieving for something I've never had?
Sister, when I'm broken
When you're holding me
It's the child who's crying for the woman

Father, can I tell you?
That I know your fear
Cause you gave it to me when you brought me here
Father, when you're hiding from the light that's inside
Don't you know that you're running from the dreamer

Naheo, don't lose your indian
Naheo
That's what I said

Brother, can I tell you?
I've been the same
When I heard all the yelling I played the game
Brother, when I leave you I will eat all your tears
And I'll have you inside when I need you

Mother, can you see me?
(Can you see me?)
See me clear, too big to fly and too small to fear
When you're shining, you can walk on your hands
Don't you cover your smile when you're laughing

Naheo, don't lose your indian
Naheo
That's what I said
(That's what I said)

The child who sings the ancient song
On Sandia's back under the Sun
Mocassin feet in Kokum's shawl
Dancing to the heart
Inside of us all

Naheo
Naheo
Naheo

Lover, can I tell you?
That I get so scared
'Cause you don't really see me behind your stare
Lover, when you're changing
When we are turning inside
Do we heal how we feel or do we ride on?

Naheo, don't lose your indian
Naheo, that's what I said, said
Naheo
Don't lose your indian
Don't lose your indian
Naheo
That's what I said
(That's what I said)
