[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I know you're tired
Don't let the world put out your fire
Take my hand and you will see
Sadness and anger aren't everything

[Verse 2]
Baby boy don't lose your sweetness
Don't think your humanity equals weakness
Take my hand and you shall see
Suppression and pain are not everything

[Verse 3]
Little rock up in the sky
Just know we're sick and asking "Why?"
Little ball falls though the void
It holds us together and endures our choices
