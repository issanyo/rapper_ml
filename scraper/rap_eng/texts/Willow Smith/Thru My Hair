That's crazy, man

[Chorus]
¡Ole!
[?]
¡Lido!
Run your fingers through my hair
I won't get you out my head
I won't get you out my- (Get you out my-)
Run your fingers through my hair
I won't get you out my head
I won't get you out my- (Get you out my-)

[Verse 1]
All my boys in cities cities say
Yeah, I been up and down your interstate
Need my mami, tell her drop me on the way (Mami)
Said they headed to that party, I'ma stay
Oh my, yeah got me in a mood, like an old lie
She be tryin' to make a move on it all night
City got life in the NY
I don't wanna know it all, like Bill Nye
Got plenty in my cup we can share mine
Movin' through the curls in my hair
Wait, you gon' get me higher than a airline

[Chorus]
Run your fingers through my hair
I won't get you out my head
I won't get you out my
(The sun is out can you meet me here)
Run your fingers through my hair
I won't get you out my head
I won't get you out my
(I won't get you out my head)

Run your fingers through my hair
I won't get you out my head
I won't get you out my
(The sun is out can you meet me here)
Run your fingers through my hair
I won't get you out my head
I won't get you out my
(I won't get you out my head)
