What else do they want from me?
I'm just a soul in the cage of a body
What else do they want from me?
I just wanna fly where nobody can stop me
What else do they see in she?
I walk around like nothing can phase me
But really if you want to see
I'm just a light but I'm going crazy
I wanna fly where nobody can see me
Where the stars are bright and the sun is green

What else?
What else for me to see?
The light in your eyes is illuminating me
That's why he wakes up in the morning and he sees me in the trees

Just tell me
Just-just tell me
Just wear it
Just-just wear the
Pretty crystal I give you
I hope it will help you
Feel better

The light in your eyes is illuminating me
That's why he wakes up in the morning and he sees me in the trees
I don't want to tell you that I'm lost
I am just here wandering in the dark
I don't even care
I can brush my hair
I'm not even here right now
Here right now
