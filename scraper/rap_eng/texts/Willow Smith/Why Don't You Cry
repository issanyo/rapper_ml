[Intro]
Why don't you?
Why, why, why why don't you cry?

[Verse 1]
Stuck in the mirror
Never seeing clearer
So open your eyes now
It's getting cloudy
I see your words, they're tryna get out
Tryna get out

[Chorus]
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry?
Why don't you cry?
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry?
Why don't you cry?

[Verse 2]
So stuck in the mirror
Start getting clearer
When I close my eyes, I
I can see the sky at night
Past the blue and the ozone layer
Past the polluted atmosphere
Nothing is more important than our connection
Me and the mother
Singing the universal song
Calling each other
Why don't we all just sing along?

[Chorus]
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry?
Why don't you cry?
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry?
Why don't you cry?

[Bridge]
Why don't you?
Why, why, why don't you cry?
Why, why, why don't you?
Why, why?
Why?
Cry!!!

[Chorus]
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry?
Why don't you cry?
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Why don't you cry?
Why don't you cry?
