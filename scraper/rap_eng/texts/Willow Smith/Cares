I do not care what people say,
I'll play this game the way I play
And all the voices that we hear (we hear we hear)
Just comes from us
We don't have ears (we don't have ears)

Just take me away, further away
Down to the beach, maybe we'll stay
Take me away, take me away today

You don't have to be scared
You don't have to wonder why
You can just sit here,
You can just look in my eyes
That's not love, mmm
That's not, that's not love
That's not love, mmm

Sorry you had to go (oh) through this (oh)
You had many other chances (oh ohh)
Sorry you came back to Earth (oh) like this (oh)
You've been to so many places

Now I'm looking for Solána in the sushi sun bar
Now I'm looking for Solána in the hurricane

What's with my hair today, (hair today)
Have it under a turban (under a turban, under a turban right now)

*Unintelligible multiple vocals*
I cannot word it (I cannot word it)
I'm doing Tai Chi

Dreads in the back, I hope that they grow
You can say yes, or you can say no
Or you could say go
Or you could say go
