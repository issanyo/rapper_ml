[verse 1: JABS & Willow Smith]
Jump in (jump in) into our red sea
And we don't (we don't) get no sleep
And finally (finally oh)
You've grown into the person i know you to be

Life don't sleep when the lights are off
You've come to see me but I've taken off
But she's still gone when he wakes up
(she's gone)
(she's gone)

[Chorus: JABS & Willow Smith]
Life don't sleep when the lights are off
People talk to me but  i don't respond cause
I'm in the clouds trying to find mars

Life don't sleep when the lights are off
People talk to me but i don't respond cause
I'm in the clouds trying to find mars

[verse 2: JABS & Willow Smith]
You've got a face of leather
Rough like your dreams your world's inside out
You're dreaming (you're dreaming) tomorrows dreams

And you've  been wondering why all your teeth are rotten
You've been lying through you're teeth to me
(wa oh wa oh)
Are you seeing clearly these things you're saying to me baby
(wa oh wa oh)

All my plants are dying
They couldn't live that long so she creates her own dimension for them
(she creates her own dimension for them)

[Chorus: JABS & Willow Smith]
Life don't sleep when the light are off
People talk to me but i don't respond cause
I'm in the clouds trying to find mars

Life don't sleep when the lights are off
People talk to me but i don't respond cause
I'm in the clouds trying to find mars
(life don't sleep)
(life don't sleep)
