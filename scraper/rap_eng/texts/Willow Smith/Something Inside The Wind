My heart's a box, I keep it locked
In the place upon my thoughts
Having dreams and taking flight
My life's a lie, but it's alright

I find my way into the light
Hum, but it's hurting
Hum, feels like I'm burning
Oh, yeah

But that's life, that's, that's life
That's life, that's, that's life
That's life
And there must be something in the wind
But that's life, that's, that's
But that's life, that's
But that's life
And there must be something in the wind
I'm always sleeping at night
But that's life

That's, that's life
What's life? Whats right?
I'm right here
I see clearer thought your eyes at night

Hum, I'm [?] of [?] this sky
Are we all divide, and I'm
And he just lived
I'm feeling down in heaven

And I cry, I, I cry

But that's life, that's
But that's life, that's
But that's life
And there must be something in the wind
But that's life, that's
But that's life, that's
But that's life
And there must be something in the wind
I'm always sleeping at night
But that's life
