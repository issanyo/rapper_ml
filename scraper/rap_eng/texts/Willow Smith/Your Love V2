[Intro]
I love you
More than you could ever know
I love you
Even when the snow is falling

[Verse 1]
Perhaps you didn't know
You swept my heart
Said those words
You cradled me
Exactly the way that I
Needed to feel good

[Verse 2]
You're touching my face
You're into cries and
You're hearing my heart and
You're risking your life
Is love is deep?
I can see in the sky
Cause we're going together
We're going so high

[Verse 3]
Too bad we don't ever see each other
It's too bad
My emotions change like the weather
And I'm sad
I just wish that I have got on board
With the plastic morals that I've never had
They're gone now
They're gone now
They're gone now
