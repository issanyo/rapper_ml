And they all fell
From the sky into my eye
I did not cry, I felt alive
And not so blind, anymore
Oh, I yelled out into the atmosphere
I hope you're here
Oh, they say how I was gone for a long time
But for me it was five minutes, aye
That's relativity for you
I could show you euphoria and you wouldn't even know, ah
No you wouldn't even know
It'd just be a subconscious plant in your mind
A subconscious plant in your mind's eye

I don't know why I cry, I lie, but I
Just feel my way through life
And try to be that shining light
For you and for me
Oh, we don't get an eternity oh
It's all an eternity
I don't know why I cry, I lie, but I
Just feel my way through life

Love runs out in a flash
I could never stick with it
But it always sticks with me
Love runs out in a flash
I could never stick with it
But it always sticks with me
