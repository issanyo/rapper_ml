[Intro]
Her birth waters gushed, filling rivers and seas
Then flooded the land and gave rise to the trees
From each drop that spilled, new grass and leaves grew
'Til sprouting green plants filled all the Earth's view

[Bridge]
Hunt and gather, let us wash away
What we once could face off, we cannot stay
In times like this we commune and we pray
To the Mother Nature who uses death to gain
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Wild woman has no people now
She walks with lion and with the wind, she flows
And in her heart there is a world of pain
But without it, higher power, she can't gain

[Chorus]
Mountain higher, glacier low
The ancient ice age steps
Where the tall grass grows
In the land of freedom
Wasting human life
It's just you and me
All love and sharpened knives

[Verse 2]
Spear and sling, we're riding side by side
On the backs of friends, the horses ride on by
Within his eyes she sees a world of blue
Little does she know, he sees the same in you

[Chorus]
Mountain higher, glacier low
The ancient ice age steps
Where the tall grass grows
In the land of freedom
Wasting human life
It's just you and me
All love and sharpened knives
It's just you and me
All love and sharpened knives
You and me
All love and sharpened knives

[Bridge]
Hunt and gather, let us wash away
What we once could face off, we cannot stay
In times like this we commune and we pray
To the Mother Nature who uses death to gain
