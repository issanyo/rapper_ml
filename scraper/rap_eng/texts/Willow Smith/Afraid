[Willow Smith]
I walked a mile to the road
You weren’t there so I went home
Got a crystal by the store today
Stood up for a girl called a whore today

This life
This life that’s full of war
Remember the love we shared when we did not care
If our skin was fair or not
If our pockets are deep or not

If you love someone with the same anatomy it’s cool
And I figured out that an atom’s me
An atom’s me, an atom’s you
And there’re atoms in this tree
Creating all this beauty

Oohoohoohooh

[Tyler Cole]
I know you know
(I walked a mile to the road)
Dreaming with the crystal
(You weren’t there so I went home)
I know I know
(You weren’t there so I went home)
Body never simple

You might see a different side of me

I walked a mile to the road
And I’m still all alone
No one here to care
No one at the lake
I wish you were here
Look at all the spheres
Everyday I wake I wanna get away
My dreams are never clear
Driving home from yours
It’s really getting hard to steer
See your shadow in the mirror
Oh, I do not have all the time or the patience
Waiting for you on this line is so sacred
Saving you from the new world and its hatred
I'm sick of being alone and complacent
These days, save them for another time
I just wanna get away
We could live another life

[Willow Smith]
Wouah (x2)
Lelelou (×4)

I know you know
Dreaming with your crystal
High and low (I know) body to be simple
You might see a different side of me
You might see the light inside of me
See the light inside of me

[Willow's conscious]
Why is the mind running like crazy
When the heart wants to say something

[Tyler Cole's conscious]
Mind is always afraid
Only one thing and that is your heart
