[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I guess they don't like me
But I never figured out why
I never tried to figure out why
I guess they think I don't like them either
Don't like them at all
That's how life goes
That's how life goes

[Chorus]
But I don't want to hold it back
I just need to learn how to let go
I don't know
I will never know
We'll never know but that's the greatest part
And I won't stop, I won't stop
I'mma ride this wave
Right to the shore of my grave
When I say goodbye to Earth
When I say goodbye to Earth
When I say goodbye to the third dimension
When I say goodbye to all this, amnesia

[Post-Chorus]
I do not want to tell you what I know
But I do not know much
I don't ever want to put on a show
But I do it all so much

[Verse 2]
When I rock with you, when I roll with you
Let's go to the beach, maybe climb some trees
We'll jump in some lakes, or maybe...swing on vines
And praise to father sun's light, oh
See I could care less what you do
I could care less where that negativity is as I'm trying to float
Where that stuff can't reach us

[Chorus]
But I don't want to hold it back
I just want to learn how to let go
I don't know
I will never know
We'll never know but that's the greatest part
And I won't stop, I won't stop
I'mma ride this wave
Right to the shore of my grave
When I say goodbye to Earth
When I say goodbye to Earth
When I say goodbye to the third dimension
When I say goodbye to all this, amnesia

[Post-Chorus]
I do not want to tell you what I know
But I do not know much
I don't ever want to put on a show
But I do it all so much
I do not want to tell you what I know
But I do not know much
I don't ever want to put on a show
But I do it all so much

[Outro]
I do not know, I do not know, I do not know
I do not know, I do not know, I do not know
I do not know, I do not know, I do not know
I do not know, I do not know, I do not know
But I don't want to hold it back
I just want to learn what I don't know
