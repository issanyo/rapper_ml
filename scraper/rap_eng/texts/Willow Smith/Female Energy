I just landed in another atmosphere
I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you have questions like, "Where did I come from?"
I know,I come from that planet that hit Tiamat
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
Years ago
I do my flows and then I get so lost
Light just take my spheres to go
Spheres to go
Spheres to go
Spheres to go
To the top of the pyramid, let's save the world like this
Conversing with light bodies (I know)
But really they all a part of me
Let's get the whip and go
'Cause I'm tired of this solar ring

Whatever (oh)
Whatever I do
Whatever
I don't care, get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking, whatever

Cause it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go, but I do not want to stop you
(stop you)
I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want to stop you
I do not want you to stop you
I don't want to stop you
