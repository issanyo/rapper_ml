[Intro]
My temple
My temple

[Verse 1]
I wanna hear your heart beat
The steady humming your merkaba spin
Everything, even thoughts about me
When I wake up in the morning time
I think about my past life
Was I with you or you with me?
We're living in a fantasy, babe it's all a dream
It's kinda hard to see
You need the heart to see
You need the heart to see, oh see

[Chorus]
What's going down in your town? I
I'm riding 'round in the night
My body is moving, I'm tryna get groving, yeah
What's going down in your head? I
I'm riding 'round in the night
I'm tryna get groving, let's go to the beach and jump in

[Verse 2]
Oh they trusted her and she tried to be
Everything that they want her to
But she had to see what she could do
And all the things that she would also
Tell me one thing
Is it really bad to have experience?
Then you know for yourself
Rather than sit home and believe in this
They said, "Willow don't touch that"
I looked and walked and then I went and touched it
They said, "Don't walk fast"
I took off running and was not near stopping

[Chorus]
What's going down in your town? I
I'm riding 'round in the night
My body is moving, I'm tryna get groving, yeah
What's going down in your town? I
I'm riding 'round
I'm gonna go, baby, the frequency
You wanna roll with me

[Bridge]
Broken
Two shards that fit together
Hoping
More come together
To make a piece of art
Bigger than anything we could imagine
To make a piece of art
That's raising the whole vibration of gaia
Going right back to the ropes

[Chorus]
What's going down in your town? I
I'm riding 'round in the night
My body is moving, I'm tryna get groving, yeah
