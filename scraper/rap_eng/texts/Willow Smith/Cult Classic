In the middle ooo wee (oh)
Broken pills
You think too slow
When I vanish, you be on your phone

Live a little, sin a little
Talk to sarah (repent) if you will

Jimmy Kimmel, im belitttled
Do you dare remember whatâ€™s real?

[Willow Smith]
Nothing but a nigga full stopping on a cult classic meta 4 track lesson
Fallin down the class systematic open season
Paramedic where the fuck you been at
I been all alone and calling nine eleven
They won't take a message they will claim they done it
Set the record straight
The needle on the vinyl
Pinot film Noire
The black and whites oppression
Never told me I have clinical depression
Gotta love him
Post apocalyptic killer
Backstroking in the LA river
While you're peace piping all your dreams
Doing black market research
Loose cannon fodder
Talk big ackon
Back home his lover
Cat calling women
That mother fucker
No optimism
No word from mother
Marvin Gaye pride parade
Flag waving rave
Andy War hall of fame
Extra pulp fiction
Sammy J

I can't wait to kiss you on the pomegranate countertop
