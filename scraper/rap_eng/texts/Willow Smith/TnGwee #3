[Verse 1: Tyler Cole]
I told if you want you could walk away
But that was yesterday we didn't talk today
I've been on my own trying to contemplate
Coming into your home I can't concentrate
Do you really want me now
Do you want to see me go
I'm knowing that you feel my sound
But you can only hear the lows
I'm crying now
You're flying out
I'm lying down
That sighing doubt
That's only if you know
Know me

[Bridge:]
It's only if you know me
Can your else see
It's only if you broke me
Can your else see

[Verse 2: Willow Smith]
I've been searching in the wind for a message
I-I I've been trying to learn something different
I-I I mean you feel f-ing different
Been doing dishes babe
I've been getting swifted up in the mountains yeah
I-I-I don't know why that is
I-I-I don't know what love is
But I see in your eye

[Breakdown]
