Classification and organization is ruining the minds of our generation
I said it
That's why they're always staying up in the sky
They add a new design to it
But they're on their phone and I'm on a roll
And I do not care cause I am the oldest one
Up in my mind, but not in real time
I'm just a... teenager
But I feel angrier than a swarm of hornets
They call us whores but it's just because
We do what we want and don't look back once
Is that what it's come to? No, no
My parents are 1 and 2, and I am their child
I am 3, I am the wild
I am free
We are the children that sing the ancient song
And we can sing it very well
But there's still so much to learn
There's still so much to earn
But I yearn

Who am I scared
Who cut us open

Tiyawn

Organization and classification is ruining the hearts of our generation
I said it
But actually, True told me that
True made the map
True took us to the forest to the top of the mountain

It's true, it's true, it's true
He told me to get on the mic and spit what's in my lung
I tried to say, I tried to tell him
"Boy, I don't do that, I don't do the things that you do"
But then he looked at me and said, "You do, you do"
[?] face too, went into my room at night
They tried to talk about who
And I'm like, "Let me sleep"
But they just wake me up
They just try to tell me the things I know already
In my cerebral capacity
But it's locked, why can't I get in?
Maybe I should ask Finn, maybe I should ask Jake
Maybe we go to a lake that I found
Maybe we go right now
And it's snowing but it's warm outside
Write a letter on the beach at night
Go to bed and then I see those lights
I see those lights, I see their eyes
Staring back at me, telling me about the symmetry
Telling me about atomic structure
The way she loves her, the way
The ocean rolls around and 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And the Taurus goes around and down
And down and down and down and down, it never stops
Never rock
I call it crystal, now you call it rock
I'm in the spot
You don't want to walk around on the hot coals of self acceptance
Man I get you, MSFTS here to rep yah
We'll do this together

Organization and classification is ruining the souls of our generation
We said it
And the kids know very well
And the kids will dig the well
Deep inside of their third eye and get all the messages inside
