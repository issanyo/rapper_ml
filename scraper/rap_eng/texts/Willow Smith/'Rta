Hello
How are you?
Ngaru Lu
Hello
I thought I knew you
But then I threw you, off the ledge of my mind
I'm out of time

I though I knew ya, know ya
But then I threw ya
Off the ledge, I'm off my head, I'm out my bed
My mama said, I am a goddess
With three eyes, six arms and a star kiss
I don't discard this, this evil
These people, their egos
The eagles, that fly overhead
Until death, there is no end, I have no friends
Soulmates, no roles play
You and me, me and you
That's ok, that's all day

Do you feel that?
The existence is coursing through your veins
You remember, why your home made you this way
You wanna chase them, fantasies are falling out the place
Can you hear them?
The vibrations are calling, calling your name

If you really wanna know the truth I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya
If you really wanna go to London, boy I'll sail ya, I'll sail us
If you see a black hole singularity, holla back at me
If you're interested in being free

If you really wanna know the truth I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya
If you really wanna go to London, boy I'll sail ya, I'll sail ya
If you see a black hole singularity, holla back at me
If you're interested in being free

If you're interested in knowing you
If you're interested in knowing who you are
No cars, no lights, just stars and sky, stars and sky
You can have the secrets to my heart
You can go wherever you want
Where the lights turns to dark now
Where the lights turns to dark now

If you really wanna know the truth I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya
If you really wanna go to London, boy I'll sail ya, I'll sail us
If you see a black hole singularity, holla back at me
If you're interested in being free
