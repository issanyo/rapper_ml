Woke up this morning
And I looked to my left
And she had cracked, she hasn't slept
The seasons are changing, and it's raining
I guess I'm sad
And it's ironic
'Cause only you can make me feel that way

The sun won't stay, not even for me
And it's getting lonely, just being with me
Your favorite season is winter
No wonder you're stay so cold
Your favorite season is winter
No wonder you're stay so cold

But you have no reason, just stick with your seasons
(Just stick with your seasons)
Go right, go right, go right, go left
She has not slept
And her dreams are so haunting
(Just so haunting)

So your blind, you see tons of snow
But nothings growing, so you'll live wondering 'Where to go?'
But nobody knows, but nobody
But nobody knows where they want to go

So you drive all night long
And she's on my back, trying to get me
To make choices so I don't lack
He looks at me, he takes 1, 2, 3
But he takes it all from me

Your favorite season is winter
No wonder you're stay so cold
Your favorite season is winter
No wonder you're stay so cold
