[Verse]
Vibrations, in the air
And everything's alright, everything's alright
You tell me that you care, and everything's alright
Boy you have feelings and I have feelings whoa
So let's just face it cause we're not patient, that's what we do
Patient, not out here, and everything's on my mind
You tell me that you care, and everything's alright
