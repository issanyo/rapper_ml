[Intro]
The bright sun in the blue water (blue water, blue water)
We fight less and love harder (love harder, love harder)
You tell me that I'm the one (that I'm the one, that I'm the one)
I tell you it's just for fun (it's just for fun, it's just for fun)
We walk the beach at midnight (at midnight, at midnight)
And watch the stars in the clear skies (in the clear skies, in the clear skies)
We both say I love you (I love you, I love you)
But it's alright (it's alright, it's alright)

Hello um
It's nice to see you here, I was ... wondering if um ... I can give you my number maybe
Oh your here for the summer
Oh that's nice, maybe we can hang out sometime
I will give my number alright, we can hang out
This will be, this will be fun
Alright, goodbye

[Verse 1]
The bright sun and the blue water
We fight less and love harder
You tell me that I'm the one
I tell you it's just for fun
We walk the beach at midnight
And watch the stars in the clear skies
We both say I love you
But it's alright (it's alright)
I write you a song, you play your guitar
You and me both sing along, we hold hands for too long
If you wanna talk I guess that's alright, if you wanna walk under the night sky
I don't really care cause we got tonight, oh baby we

[Hook]
It's just a couple months, but we do it anyway
It's only for the summer, but we do it anyway
It's just a couple months, but we do it anyway
We do it anyway, d-d-do it anyway

[Verse 2]
I got those cold drinks for those hot nights
You can hang with us if you act right
Got long hair with them short sides
I like your style, your from the north side
Sea shells, and palm trees
I call you, you call me
Talk all night, mob all day
"Girl where you at?" "Boy I'm on my way"
On the beach again, never thought that this would end
Dinner by the water, wish that summer time was longer UH
Don't really care what we do tonight
Goodnight kiss, till the mood is right
Laying by the beach with you, wishing this would never end

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hello you know
It was nice to see you tonight (laughter)
Laying by the beach, and uh just chilling with you it was good
I'll miss you, you know thinking that we can call each other soon
You know, it was nice, the summer fling
(Laughter) Yeah, well thank you, thank you so much
Goodnight, goodnight
Do it anyway (x13)
