You suck the life right out of me
I was so blind I could not see
It sucks 'cause you give me butterflies
But when I'm alone I cry seas from my eyes

You are a human leech (oh, no)
You are a human leech (oh, no)
But you're so good to me

You suck the life right out of me
And I willingly give you everything
It sucks cause I know that it's wrong
Making me weak while you get strong

You are a human leech (oh, no)
You are a human leech (no, yeah)
But you're so good to me

You can't control me
I'm not obsessed with the idea of love, I am love
You cannot hold me
My big old bunny is just enough

You are a human leech
But you're so good to me
