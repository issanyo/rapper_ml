If you ever get close to a human
And human behavior
Be ready, be ready to get confused
And be in my head after
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
To human behavior
But yet so, yet so irresistible
I see it in my stars
There is no map
Enchanted

They're terribly, terribly moodly
Of human behavior
Then all of a sudden they turn happy
And be all sad right after
But oh, to get involved in the exchange
Oh human emotions
Is ever so, ever so satisfying
To stay in my head after
And there is no map
Enchanted

Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior, human behavior

And there is no map
And the compass couldn't tell yah
Just one step and you're ended

Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
Human behavior
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
Human
Human
Human
Human

So uncool to be human
I walk in the room and
These people look at me
I ask who you are
I am the one you see in your dream

Cool to be human
So weird to be human
Going to Nibiru

Definitely, definitely, definitely
Definitely, definitely no logic
Definitely, definitely, definitely
Definitely, definitely no logic
Definitely, definitely, definitely
Definitely, definitely no logic
Human behavior
