Your heart melts into my cup
It tastes like warm honey
My self seems never enough
To me only it's funny

But now I open up my eyes big enough to cry
The universe is too bright
Light beams in the sky speaking to my third eye
Speaking through my third eye

Your heart melts into my cup
It tastes like warm honey
I know it's never enough
Only to us it's funny

But then we fall back to earth
Fall back to life, fall back in strife
But then we come back to us
Learn how to love, bask in new light
I'll be walking for miles, searching for miles
Trying to find myself

But then I realized I don't exist
But then I realized I don't exist
But then I realized I don't exist
But then I realized I don't exist

Your heart melts into my cup
It tastes like warm honey
I know it's never enough
To us only it's funny
