[Willow]
They took our villages
And hope for all our stars
That's how we live like this
So kids  the other side of this sphere will stop
Oh no
What happened to our mother?
What happened to our love for her?
Nayn hu Eywa
Hidden behind the conditioning we all live this

[Crystal Mec]
Don't think we don't love you
[?] Rta
Is this our pilgrimage
A journey to find ourselves
Cause I haven't met none of ya
If you come into Mecca tell me what's up

[Willow and Crystal Mec]
What happened to our mother?
What happened to her light?
Is it just hidden in the hills inhabited by her natives
For just her children
For just her children
I'm not saying I'm perfect
But I know, I know, I know my planets worth it
My planets worth it
And I'm not perfect
But I love my, love my planet
Yes I love my, love my planet

[Willow]
I've had it with the guns and the wars
The rich and the poor
Suppress knowledge that we both know
People who be running all the wars say that's right
Don't tell me what's right
Now get out of my life
You dimming my light
Sprays in the sky
While greys in the sky
Trying to check on the children
Trying to check on experiments
It's actually the Annunaki that came down and spout
Trying to get the gold outside of the ground
Telling these people they can not stop digging
Until they are living and we were both saying oh no
No we have minds
We have consiuousness
It's our time
You gotta go
It's our time
You gotta go back to Nibiru
You gotta go where we ain't seeing you

[Crystal Mec]
You gotta go to where your skin is blue
Me and my friends holding hands
Yeah we're indigo
Yes we're indigo
Yes, yes we're indigo
