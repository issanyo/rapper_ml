[Chorus]
I try to be sugar and spice
But I’m melancholy and can’t do anything right
The monsters under my bed keep making noise at night
I just want silence, silence
Bye kids
Try this

[Verse 1]
I sat in front of the teary screen
Sad he’s always screaming at me
They wanna puncture me and then wonder why I bleed
The big city everyone is looking for
Step on my ladder and bathe in glory
Inject my soul with darkness
And take my heart and go market it
And the past lasts like a tear stain
I’m in the dark, pin on the wall
But I don’t see a thing
I write circles in the sky
While I’m drowning
While I’m drowning

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I’ll bet you think you know but you’re so close
A million miles away I can hear your thoughts
Predicting motions or your next move
I’m right in front of you
I’m right in front of you
Your mouth is moving but you don’t move
I’m right in front of you
I’m right in front of you
Take a swing at me
I’ll fight till the death
My light is bright

[Chorus]

[Verse 1 - Repeated]
I sat in front of the teary screen
Sad he’s always screaming at me
They wanna puncture me and then wonder why I bleed
The big city everyone is looking for
Step on my ladder and bathe in glory
Inject my soul with darkness
And take my heart and go market it
And the past lasts like a tear stain
I’m in the dark, pin on the wall
But I don’t see a thing
I write circles in the sky
While I’m drowning
While I’m drowning
