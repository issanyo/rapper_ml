[Verse 1: Willow]
Falling deep, into the sea
You don't even know my name
I look at you, you look at me
And we both know it's not a game

[Bridge: Willow]
I take the lead
I take the lead
And we, we dance and sing
I take the lead

[Verse 2: Willow]
Melodic Chaotic (chaotic) times
They catch it. (they catch it, they catch it, they catch it)
My eyes blink faster than the lightning, and I think
You should carry me, I believe

I, I believe in us
And I
I can smell your entity
From here

[Hook: Willow]
Melodic Chaotic (chaotic, chaotic) (4x)

[Outro: MVSIC & Willow]
Let the beat rock

Melodic Chaotic
[Fading out]
Chaotic (x9)
