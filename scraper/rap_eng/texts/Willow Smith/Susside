I am dark nights
I am scarred skin
I am shark bites
And darkness
I am all the things that make you cry
But still you wanna be by my side
My side

But there's always a bright side
To this crazy thing we call life
But there's always a bright side
To this crazy thing we call life

You're dark nights
You're scarred skin
You're shark bites
And you're darkness
You're all the things that make me cry
But still I wanna be by your side
Your side

But there's always a sus side
To this crazy thing we call life
But there's always a sus side
To this crazy thing we call life
