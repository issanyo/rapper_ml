Inside your mind I converse with your star self
And tell me why I'm here right now
Hidden in a cloud, I'm hydrogen atoms
Split me up and mess up your planet
Mess up your planet
Just like the Greys
Just like the Martians
Just like a [?]
Just like I remember
Star kids and now I'm sitting here
Now I'm passing a lightyear
Inside my sphere, yes in my planet
Inside my heart, I will just plant it
The seed of knowledge
I said I got this

I don't think it's fair that you're on Earth
And I'm up up here
Making stars and galaxies and comets
Making a life on other dimensions

I don't think it's fair that you're on Earth
And I'm up here
Making stars and galaxies and planets
Making a life on other dimensions
