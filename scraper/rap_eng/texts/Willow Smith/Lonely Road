[Intro: Willow x Chloe & Halle]
Aaaaah (aaaaaah)

[Verse 1: Willow]
I want to see the world through divine eyes
Cross the lake and fly into the sky
I might may be crazy or this world is shady
But I hope that you don't mind

[Chorus: Willow x Chloe & Halle]
'Cause I'll breathe alone
and I'll sleep alone
and I'll eat alone
and I'll laugh alone
'Cause I'm in the zone
with my lovely bones
and you'll cry alone
on the lonely road
'Cause I'll breathe alone
and I'll sleep alone
and I'll eat alone
and I'll laugh alone
'Cause I'm in the zone
with my lovely bones
and you'll cry alone
on the lonely road

[Bridge: Willow x Chloe & Halle]
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
(lonely road, lonely road)
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
(lonely road, lonely road)

[Verse 2: Chloe & Halle]
Me and you see different sides of the moon
I'm on a star and you're on Neptune
Blue as the tears that fall from my eyes
Lookin' down on Earth as you monopolize

[Chorus: Willow x Chloe & Halle]
'Cause I'll breathe alone
and I'll sleep alone
and I'll eat alone
and I'll laugh alone
'Cause I'm in the zone
with my lovely bones
and you'll cry alone
on the lonely road
'Cause I'll breathe alone
and I'll sleep alone
and I'll eat alone
and I'll laugh alone
'Cause I'm in the zone
with my lovely bones
and you'll cry alone
on the lonely road

[Bridge: Willow x Chloe & Halle]
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
(lonely road, lonely road)
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
(lonely road, lonely road)

[Outro Willow x Chloe & Halle]
Aaaaahh
