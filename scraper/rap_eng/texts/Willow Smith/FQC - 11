[Verse 1: Telana]
I've been
Losing my mind lately
I've been
Taking my time, before time takes me
I've been lost again
I've been over it all I want it to end
So I [?] my life is pretend
I've been

[Hook]
Where did you go? (x4)
Go
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

[Verse 2: Wilough]
You know they come at night
In your dreams and they're all in the right places
Nobody even touches with the truth
Injustice in the youth
And they turn around and walk away
Nobody does it like we do
We walk up in the room
And we shine out loud
All light, just flashing out the dark
Flashing out the dark, flashing out the dark
And you know we super going
Up to the top of the mountain
Light light light, just flashing in the dark
Flashing in the dark, flashing in the dark

[Hook]
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did...
Where did you go?
