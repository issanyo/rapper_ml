I'm just an itty bitty shard
Floating through the wind
I told her she could meet me at the park
But she never did
I cried and cried and waited to the dark
Behind the lunar glare

Twirling, swirling
Feeling so at home within her locks of hair

You, you
Tell me where you've been
Where you've been
I'm running around feeling crazy
But I know it's just because you called me 'baby'
