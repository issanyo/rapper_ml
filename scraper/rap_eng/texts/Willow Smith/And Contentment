[Chorus]
Happiness and contentment
Come from zero comparison
One-hundred percent, personal experience

[Verse 1]
Life gets so wild and so
Free and auras channel through me
Source energy
Ooo baby girl
Your heart is like a tree
Damn baby girl
You gotta shed your leaves
My sword is up
And my heart is down
But you would never know
My heart is broken
Don't make a sound
That's why you never know
Baby girl
There's so much love in your eyes
So baby girl
Don't let em' turn it into ice

[Chorus]
Happiness and contentment
Come from zero comparison
One-hundred percent, personal experience

[Verse 2]
I'm just a caterpillar in its cocoon
Waiting to see the world again
And when I wake from eternal sleep
I see the sun and I don't cry, I weep
'Cause I am turning, turning
Inside my skin
I'm learning, learning how to give in
I'm burning, burning on my own feelings
And  using the flames to make a new me
To be
