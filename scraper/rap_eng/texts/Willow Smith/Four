Yo, this is the crazy part about life
I'm over here at south central of Los Angeles
Carrying a jacket and a box
And I'm hear chilling and I hear my nephew song on the radio, bro
That's kinda crazy, I thank God for you, bro
That is so dope I got a chance to be alive
[?]
That's crazy! It's playing right here while I'm talking to you
A jacket and a box
Can you hear me?
Can you hear?
Alright, [?]

Beats, living better
Green, knocked your banner
Green, like the lands and
Superheroes, superheroes
Beats, living better
Green, knocked your banner
Green, like the lands and
Superheroes, superheroes

You can't say 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Knocked your banner)
And I'm just being crazy over here
You're tryina change crazy on my hair
But I can't hear it
1, 2, 3, 4
(Green, knocked you banner)
(Green, like the land and)
1, 2, 3, 4
(Superheroes)
(Superheroes, superheroes, superheroes)

It's funny how this ties together...
We're hanging out at the crib
Just reading some Osho...
I talk about Osho a lot...
So, we were sitting here...
And hum...
I just randomly said
I said you know, 'My uncle would love you'...
And she asked me why
And I said 'He would have thought you were really pretty'
And she just kinda smiled and...
Yeah...
