Oh, Nadine
I woke up from a dream last night
Where all the skies were green

You were the Sun
Down on the wave came your daylight
Oh, Nadine, you were the Sun

Oh, Nadine, oh
Oh, Nadine
Down on the wave came your daylight

You were in my dream
Oh, Nadine
Down on the wave came your daylight

Oh, Nadine
I have a funny feeling you'd be
So good to me

Oh, Nadine
You told me
You woke up from the dream
You were in my dream
