[Verse 1]
I see you, I do
Your hands are guiding for who you are to love you
I am not sorry for what I do
My soul sits tidy in my being
I'm all-seeing, all-feeling, all-creating

[Chorus]
I feel so much love through you
You, not so, be in my dream
I saw you asleep

[Verse 2]
You make me feel like a cloud of H20
Baby I've seen you before
You're dancing softly, oh what do I know?
Oh yeah I'm dancing for sure
I'm dancing for sure
I don't see you often, what do I know?
Needing you in the astral realms
I can call your dorm room right from my labradorite
I know you don't think I'm the right one
But all of these energies light
And I'm just trying to get like one (get like one)

[Chorus]
I feel so much love through you
You, not so, be in my dream
I saw you asleep

[Outro]
I, I, I saw you in my dream
I, I, I, I knew you did not see me
I, I, I saw you in my dream
I, I, I, I knew you did not see me
See me
See, knew you did not see me
See me
Knew you did not see me
I, I, I, cried, cried
Knew you did not see me
I, I, I, cried, cried
Knew you did not see me
Knew you did not see me
Knew you did not see me
Knew you did not see me
