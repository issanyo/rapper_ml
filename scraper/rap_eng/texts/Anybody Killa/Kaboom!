Dark Lotus (Lotus)
I can make it thunder (Dark Lotus make it thunder)

[Jamie Madrox]
Don't be lookin' to the sky for birds or planes
All you find is the Dark Lotus spittin' the Black Rain
Bodies slammin' each other
On clouds makin' electrical sparks
That can be seen for miles in the depths of the dark
Do you spot the clouds with thunderous roars
That's when bolts start flying and rain starts to pour
Where you gonna run from?
Here we gotta clear view
Of what electrical bolts you know that we gonna spear you

[Violent J]
I gotta fifteen pound sledgehammer that I bury in the dome
Some people in them unlocked tombs
And fuck a headache
I pop heads like grapes
And I keep swingin' at it till a bed breaks
I make ya boom
I'm always spendin' bloody money
And if my momma found how I got it, she wouldn't love me
It's over quick
I blow the brain matter out ya ears
And leave the bloodiest crimescene a muthafuckas seen in years

(Chorus x4)
I can make it thunda
(KABOOOOOOM!!!)
(Shake the ground)

[Monoxide Child]
Explosive!
And I can split the ground
I'm that crazy muthafucka that just walked into town
WIth a backpack full of C4
And your backpack's full of wack raps cause
It's all that ya good for
Push the button, I dare you go ahead and do it
Ahh fuck it I'm 'bout to lose it
I'll show you there's nothing to it
I blew it up and then I walked away clean
I wiped the black like a slate at a house on the scene

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Don't make me jump over, put Zeus in a headlock
Then stamp my foot and make the Earth crack
Notice
My hatchet blade is sharp as a razor
And split the spine of many a hater
When we roll this deal with six petals
And bang more heads together than heavy metal
When my hands hit ya now ya gonna feel a grip
And when I go to Hell I'll pimp the Devil like a BIYa-ITCH!

(Chorus x4)
I can make it thunda
(KABOOOOOOM!!!)

[Blaze]

Feel the Earth shake when my feet penetrate the ground
The Dark Lotus fam is shaking clouds bringin' the thunder down
Forget about the scope, we're like a psycho killa
There ain't no method to my madness I only like to murda
It's cool to see bitches try to run, they won't get far
They just some movin' targets and we aimin' for the heart
Pour this rain down like spurts of flash floods
And dirty people lying in pools of their own blood

[Anybody Killa]
Do you see the light flash when you walk in the dark?
Lotus keeps you on the edge of your seat with a spark
Everything around is crumblin'
Listen to the sounds of the center of the Earth
Rumblin'
Can you feel that?
Every place you look, your blinded by a sign
The thunders coming strong and your about to die
Hell is droppin' faster
Rain is burnin' hot
And the only thing that you can do is sit back and watch

(Chorus x4)
I can make it thunda
(KABOOOOOOM!!!)

(KABOOOOOOM!!!)
(KABOOOOOOM!!!) (Looks Like Rain!)
(KABOOOOOOM!!!)
(KABOOOOOOM!!!)
