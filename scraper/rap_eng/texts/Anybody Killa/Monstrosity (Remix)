[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Monstrosity, our anthologies, new velocity
It's probably in perportion to people's disturbing curiosity
Everyone likes a psycho, especially (Krazee) freek shows
With a chain, on display, and amusement of all the people
"Look mom he's waving back at me is he actually
Sick enough to kill me and eat me after he capture me?
Or will he keep me alive?"
Picture my anamosity
The thought of me killin' you 'for I eat you is generosity!

[Verse 2: The R.O.C.]
Where are the ride of sky's men?
Sick of the way that I cry when
Wish I rush stuff like a bison
While teeth are as sharp as a lycan
Utilize all of my outlets
Take me about this, no can't do that
Blew out my brains and they grew back
Blew out your brains, I'mma use that
No simply crazy and you can't get my station
I'm not even on the right frequency scale
My rhythmatic form, how it rips it right off the back
And our army is finicky, vengeance swells
You hate this male
You chop down my sails
I'm drinkin' the shit cause I'm sick
The price of my body
Rippin' you outta my conscious for all
The nigga's a monster

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Gotta hit my brain right? Before I leave behind a
A murderer scene at arrival in one of your gang fights
And I'll do it in plain sight, I'm underground like a drain pipe
I'm like a monster lookin' for something to eat by daylight
Please don’t let me leave from no house
Or I’ll become the next killa the news is talkin' about
You've got nothin' more than a mouth and I spit evil and poison
I can never be casted out

[Verse 4: ABK]
I'm just a monster
Ready to conquer all the filthy in my city
Detroit's looking destroyed, annoyed and always dizzy
Now we all mindless lunatics, roaring with some candlesticks
Time to operate and evacuate your leadership
No apologies
I inflict what i predict
And there ain't no stopping me because my fate is to exist
Take it right back to the east where the beast was created
Awakened with opened gates and got us all motivated

[Bridge]
Take a look through the mind of a (x 4)
Take a look through the mind of a monster (x 3)
MONSTER

[Verse 5: Priceless]
I'm an abomination
Like an Osama hating terroristic characteristic As-salamu alaykum
That's twisted, it's Twiztid, spitting lyrics sick and exquisite
Sittin' with spirits sippin' on spirit
Listen, you'll hear it
Dibblin' and dabblin', black magic, the black savage
He's back at it to bring rap back cuz it lacks status
Wack rap like black magnets, attracts faggots
Like crack addicts [?] to smack addicts
Me i'm violent but sleeping in green giant
Like Kobe the B. Bryant
The noble and king tyrant that
Slipped you the crack, hoping too see you pride it
Give you some dope shit and hope you agree to buy it

[Verse 6: Acie High]
I died and went to hell to holla at the devil cuz i had a question
Got to talking then i realized i was in my daddy's presence
Now i'm back as a bastard and giving you lessons
Starting as the boogeyman in the closet of the adolescents (boo)
Now fast forward towards the end of existence
Where you're asking forgiveness for your sins to repentance
To prepare for the inmates supposed to give you your sentence
Got a regular ass nigga that's just in for forensics
Man, hell's barred with horns
Suppose to grow em later but i got em when i was born
Hoping to picket at you sickly motherfuckers who discuss
Permanent bastard remarks
I'll never have to adjust
