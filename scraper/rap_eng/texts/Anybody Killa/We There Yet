(Talking)

(Anybody Killa)
Sometimes it feels like we've been driving all night
Hungry as a stray dog, with no food in sight
Had a bomb ass show, now it's on to the next
Full tank of gas, with a bag of stress
Hoping that the next city's got that good
So that I can get my nerves straight
And make my brain shake
It's been hours, but it seems like days
Bored as a muthafucka, wide awake

(Chorus)
Are we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show
Damn near everywhere I go
Are we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show
Damn near everywhere I go
Are we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show
Damn near everywhere I go
Are we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show
Damn near everywhere I go

(Break)(x2)
I can't take this, are we there yet?
Put the pedal to the metal, and let's ride!

We on these crazy highways, smoke away the night before
Conversating about when we come back, it's got to be just as dope
Oh the party in the parking lots, on the streets up by the beaches
It takes so much time to get there, I always have the urge to speak

(Chorus)
Boogie nights, doing it right
Up till the sun comes up so who's driving?

All I know is that you better pay attention
There might be something, you're missing
So keep your eyes wide open
And look out for something weird
