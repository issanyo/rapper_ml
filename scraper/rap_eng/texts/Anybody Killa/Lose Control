I can't stop, can't stop thinking
About you at all
I called you up to come on round tonight
You wouldn't give a straight answer
But you wouldn't say no
Even though you're going with him
Here comes the night
Lead me on
In your veins
Warm inside
Heart beats fast
Lights are low
I want you
Let it go
You arrive with cool in your eyes
And explain to me
How he makes you feel inside
So safe, secure
Later on as the night is falling
You bring me on with violent words
Desire and being young
Here comes the night
Lead me on
In your veins
Warm inside
Heart beats fast
Lights are low
I want you
Let it go
Here comes the night, it is coming on
The lights are low and our records on
Inside your veins and you lead me on
Here comes the night, it is coming on
