[Intro:]
Don't fucking piss me off
I said don't fuckin' piss me off
Choke your fucking head

[Verse 1:]
I hurt myself to make the pain disappear
And then I fear that if people see my scars they will call me weird
I'm out of control with it, I know I need help
Plus I'm tired of these cards that my life was dealt
And see that I am not the only one who cuts
Every time I think the world sucks
Is it a problem I have some kind of complication
Cause my only aggravation is my own dedication
I got a big heart that looks out for most
Even if I'm feeling lost paint it forward is how I roll
And I know that there's a lot more to gain
Even if we have a little happy pain (dick)
So cut with me, I'm feeling born again
Every time my heart bleeds from the tip of my pen
Like I'm inhaling fresh oxygen
Instead of always being on the defensive end

[Hook:]
Bang yo head
Up against the wall, wish you were dead
Slit your wrist
Then hide the cuts so no one knows what you did
I'm so pissed
As if the only way that I could forget
Is to self inflect
A little pain to make me happy again
Bang yo head

[Interlude:]
Yeah, I've been down on my mothafuckin' luck
I've lost jobs I've wanted to bang my head against a wall
Slit my wrists and bleed all over your brand new white tee shirt
Bitch WHAT!

Let the pain make you happy like a stress reliever
When the world got you feeling like a underachiever
In my 80's were like so depressive
And if you know me well then you know I'm aggressive
I got a rap sheet for being a deadbeat
I guess I'm incomplete so my body I mistreat
It's like I really never did belong
So I made a theme song, come and sing along
If people hate me, I'm no good
I always say I'm miss understood
I been this way since my childhood
And I've dealt it my way the best I could
I'm confident so I must attempt
Not to bang my head over no nonsense
And if I do I face the consequence
Of finding out the hard way of having common sense

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Bang yo head ya'll
Let it hurt!
And if you wanna get really deep let the blood spill
Ill be mad than a mothafucka
I'm about to take the pain out on myself so I can be...
Happy again
