[Hook: ABK/ (girl)]
Would you die for me?
(This is the way it should be)
Yeah baby do it for me
Would you die for me?
(Because your love is so sweet)
Cmon get closer and see
Would you die for me?
(This is the way it should be)
Yeah baby do it for me

(Oh baby put it in deep)
Just close your eyes and go sleep

[Verse 1: ABK]
I love you to death girl do you feel the same?
Ain't no better way to prove it without feelin some pain
So I'm askin you, would you die for me?
The last breath that you breathe will I be there to see?
If I'm all you wanted and I'm all you need
Can I count on you if it comes to you or me?
I always knew that you had it in you
Past on, dead and gone, our love is still continued
That's why I'm into you, because you're so down
Life or death it don't matter you gon be around
You know I won't forget anything you do
The way you scream as you bleed when I'm stickin you
Girl love it, take it, dream about it
Since you always planned to be about it
You say you'll die for me well I'm here to collect
So come a little closer baby you ain't seen shit yet cmon

[Verse 2: ABK]
Forever you'll always be my internal sunshine
Down to ride like Bonnie and Clyde anytime
You got heart and it definitely shows
I can see it beating out your open chest, bleeding through your clothes
Open incision, I told you I'd be gentle
And I'm glad you ain't hold back even a little you so brave
And I love how you all whipped up, down to die for a killa just to bust that crush

[Bridge: ABK]
I love how you moan and scream
I love how you take it deep
I love how we both a team
Girl would you die for me?
I love that we never apart
I love how I stole your heart
I love how it beats in the palm of my hand
Girl would you die for me?

[Verse 3: ABK]
She's dangerous and probably could take whatever
Whenever I have to leave she knows it won't be forever
She's the one I trust and I'll say that for life
Cause I would not think twice on making this girl my wife
I can't let her go cause I think she's a keeper
If I could never see her my heart would just get weaker
So I keep her close and away from everyone
They would never understand just what we've overcome
