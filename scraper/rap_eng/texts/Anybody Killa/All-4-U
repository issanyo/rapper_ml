[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Right Here
Is All for you

[Chorus:]
(This is)
This is all for you
All for you
(All for you)
This all for you
All for you
(This is all)
This all for you
All for you
(All for you)
This all you
All for you

As my fools keep rollin'
I'mma keep strollin'
Shraight to your neighborhood
Sippin' on my 40's
Screamin "Oh, lordy"
Times in my life I could

1 mile, 2 mile, 3 mile, 4
Smokin' blunts in the window
Bangin' with some hoes
Man, ya'll can't know
Ain't no room for your folks
I'm yo Ghetto Neighbor
Representing for sure

When I'm rollin' with Killa
I grip the RV
There's a nation around the world
I'm back to the D
As I slip into character
Ain't no need to front
All alone in the closet
Man, smokin' a blunt

We are the Road Fools
This is how we roll
Fridgerator full of beer
And fat sacks to smoke
Going place to place
I mean state to state
Barbeque's in the parking lot
Fix me a plate

[Chorus:]
(This is)
This is all for you
All for you
(All for you)
This all for you
All for you
(This is all)
This all for you
All for you
(All for you)
This all you
All for you

[x2:]
This is how we roll
This is how we roll
This is how we roll
This is how we roll
This is how we roll
This is how we roll
Doin', doin'
Doin' it all for you

6 in the morning
Tour bus truck stopped
Pushin' eggs, some showers
Some lizards in the locks
Head, hell yeah
The fuck you talkin' about
Road fools heading out
No doubt

My name is shittalka
I love to talk shit
This is all for you
Ain't no need to get pissed
All the poor to the people that's feelin' my groove
I talk a lot of shit
Cuz you a mother fuckin' Road Fool!

[Chorus:]
(This is)
This is all for you
All for you
(All for you)
This all for you
All for you
(This is all)
This all for you
All for you
(All for you)
This all you
All for you

See you at the instore tours and more
Or the mall while I'm buying dress shoes for court
Representin' my family worldwide
Because we all stand together with pride
(Much luv!)
See you at the instore tours and more
