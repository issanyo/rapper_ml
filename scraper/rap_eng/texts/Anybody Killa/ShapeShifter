Shape, Shift
You Can see me know but you won't when i shift
Turn into a creacher that you can't fuck with
Shape, Shift
You Can see me know but you won't when i shift
Turn into a creacher that you can't fuck with


Verse 1 (Anybody Killa)

The Jam inside of me is hungry for blood
Creepy Creacher in the night crawling all thru the mud
Patrole the earth like the police, mad and shaky
Looking for that fresh kill it's crazy tasty
Terrorize your Neighborhood and jeopardize your life
Leave your family in fear afraid of the night
I'm the one that adapts to your every step
Then takes you down before you  get a chance call for help
Worst nightmare you ever had awake and terrorfied
No Sleep for Weeks your freaked with thoughts of suicide
Your Mind can't take what you just seen
It's like a Dream no voice left so you can't scream
Ain't no time for running i'm coming
So what you gone do?
When you See This Kills In Front
Now What you gone do?
I'mma take it to a new level watch me unleash
The Wickedest of all the Beasts, Shapeshifter!

Chorus

(Shape) Blood Soaked Ground war paint on my face
(Shift) Sharp Hatchet in my hand representing for my race
(Shape) You Can see my now But you won't when i shift
(Shift) Turn into a creacher that you can't fuck with
(Shape) Blood Soaked Ground war paint on my face
(Shift) Sharp Hatchet in my hand representing for my race
(Shape) You Can see my now But you won't when i shift
(Shift) Turn into a creacher that you can't fuck with

Verse 2 (Anybody Killa)

I'm outside looking in i see your every breath
Something more than a threat i'm here to haunt you to death
Make you Remember your Sins as i dismember your limbs
Needles and pins holding your eyelids so you see me grin
They Call me the Perfect shape because the way that i shift
So Swift, The way i move i'm like a spiritual gift
Unleashed to the land for the world to witness
Native tongue spit wicked shit with sickness
No bullshit boy i'm strictly Business
I got warrior blood so there is no illness
I'm one hundred Percent, ain't no room for cuts
Unless they all over your stomach revealing ya guts
Ain't no time for running i'm coming
So what you gone do?
When you See This Kills In Front
Now What you gone do?
I'mma take it to a new level watch me unleash
The Wickedest of all the Beasts, Shapeshifter!

Verse 3 (Anybody Killa)

Mystical being leaving your family grieving
Darkness in the night searching  for a new feeding
Sharp nails to rip thru your flesh with ease
As you drop to your knees giving your neck a squeeze
I'm Like Magic when it comes to this, Underground
For eternity i will exist, Earthbound
I'm the last thing you see before you vanish, disappear
Leaving all your people in a panic, unclear

Chorus

(Shift) Sharp Hatchet in my hand representing for my race
(Shape) You Can see my now But you won't when i shift
(Shift) Turn into a creacher that you can't fuck with
(Shape) Blood Soaked Ground war paint on my face
(Shift) Sharp Hatchet in my hand representing for my race
(Shape) You Can see my now But you won't when i shift
(Shift) Turn into a creacher that you can't fuck with
(Shape) Blood Soaked Ground war paint on my face
(Shift) Sharp Hatchet in my hand representing for my race
(Shape) You Can see my now But you won't when i shift
(Shift) Turn into a creacher that you can't fuck with
