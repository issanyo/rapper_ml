I just don't understand how everyone in this world, all of a sudden, got so hard
Could it be me or just does it seem like certain people try and take it too far
I don't know but when the time comes, motherfuckers better show respect
And if they don't then you best believe, this warrior going to shave some heads with a dull hatchet
Ain't no fooling around, I'll beat the shit out of your bitch and dump shots in your moms house
I got the urge to ball up my fist and start swingin, so since I'm in a bad mood, bring it

[Chorus]
What's with the attitude?
What's with it, what's with it
What's with the attitude?
Everybody's entitled to have one
What's with the attitude?
What's with it, what's with it
What's with your attitude?
Everybody's entitled to have one
I'm aggravated, feeling depressed, it's like my hearts beating too damn fast
People in my face makin it muddy from the dirt that they talk and I need to clean it off
Sometimes I need to get away to another place away from all the hate
So I can sit back and relax and try to clear my head
Instead of staying in the hood and leaving bodies for dead
I'm so damn emotional, and I think that it's time for me to take control
Instead of fast pace I'm gonna put it in slow mo
So you will understand when I say don't test me ho

[Chorus]
Lots of people say I'm a kind hearted guy
I am but some of ya'll should be terrified
Why, guess it all boils down to trust
Before a motherfucker really starts to self destruct
Attitudes, everyone's entitled, but some of ya'll take it to a level that's vital
Mood swings, Jekyll and Hyde, aggravated individuals upset with life
Who wants try to calm me down when I'm in a state of mind that wants to let off rounds
Guess I'm tired of just playing it cool, so every now and then I get an attitude

[Chorus (til end)]
