(Bullet)
When I got my pimpsuit on bitch step back a minute
Pimpin ain't easy but I'm never gone quit it
Bitch get out there and work your biscuit
Bring home my fuckin' money and some breakfast with it
If he got cash bitch let swamp thing hit it
If he want ass bitch let him balls deep in it
And if somebody waitin' in line you ain't finished
Cause pussy needs money even dried and diminished, bitch

(Sawed Off)
Thuggin threw the hood in my new pimpsuit
Huntin down these hoes to try and claim my loot
Known as the magician with a gang of tricks
That be poppin' his collar while you be flappin' your lips
Keep talking shit man I'll pull your bitch
Man, I'm heartless and shameless
Quit actin' like you don't know where the game is
Pull out the sawed off and make your mans heart stop
Tell him you rollin' with a pimp so back off, biatch

(Chorus 2x)
All the hookers be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the thugs be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the Rydas be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the bitches be lovin' my, pimpsuit

(Full Clip)
Oh no, my pimpsuit bout to debut
When I pop my lapel bitches gotta change in sassoons
From the drip watch my dirty dip
Famous, iced out from knuckles to tip
All this non-since feed me some gators
My toes be laced with pre-historic raptors
But hold up hoe you better think twice
Cause this desert eagle will fit in your face nice

(Lil' Shank)
I pimp through life perp and crush the law
Over coat all Mink till the muthafuckin' floor
Pimp slap back hand Rolex on wrist
With so many diamonds shinin' that I'ma knock your bitch
Pimpin' don't be mad be about your skrill and get your feel
Of the finer things in life you acquire for pimpin' skills
You can put that hoe to work it don't matter how friendly she is
You turn that hooker out into a franchise business

(Chorus 2x)
All the hookers be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the thugs be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the Rydas be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the bitches be lovin' my, pimpsuit

(Cell Block)
My pimpsuit is always clean
Know dat, I ate style chipped and dipped with money green
7 hoes in my stable to stack my paper in shit
And some old ass them bitches on the strip
My pimp hand is strong and my game is on point
Got your woman on my dick after rollin one joint
I walk around with no less then four hoes
I be the ghetto Hugh Heffner in the streets I suppose, bitch

(Converse)
I'm lookin' too cute in my pimpsuit
It's the Michael Jackson glitter boy with the matchin' boots
Can you feel it hoes that get my money never steal it
Cause my pimp suits are as shiny like the sun once I reveal it
It's better if then you tuxedo with matchin' Speedo's
My pimpsuit all day pays in torpedoes
So run tell your mama that the grass is greener
And get my pimpsuit fresh right up out the cleaners

(Chorus 2x)
All the hookers be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the thugs be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the Rydas be lovin' my, pimpsuit
All the bitches be lovin' my, pimpsuit
