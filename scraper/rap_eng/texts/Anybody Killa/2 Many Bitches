(Chorus 2x)
2 many bitches wanna see this thug
When I be
Ridin' (Ridin')
Glidin' (Glidin')
Doin' a buck twenty-five on I-94

(Blaze)
Bitches call me daddy (Hey dad!)
They like the way a muh'f**ka creep
Through the hood in a caddy
I'm a mack in my own right, like Cube said
Getting my dick sucked in a alleyway, by a chickenhead
I don't love that hoe, and I ain't handcuffing
Too many bitches, and they turkies needed stuffing
Like this bitch the other day, begging me to drive over
And beat it up properly
I'm like a young Wilt, still in his prime
Cause there's oh so many bitches
And there's oh so little time
They all want a piece of the dead, and they can't have it
Still a little picky, on which hoes that I'm stabbing
So if I serve dick to you, you've been blessed
Now go home and brag about the shit to your friends (uh oh!)
That's the way it goes I suppose
Got to hit the store, for some more rubbers
For these hoe's
2 many bitches

(Chorus 2x)
2 many bitches wanna see this thug
When I be
Ridin' (Ridin')
Glidin' (Glidin')
Doin' a buck twenty-five on I-94

(Anybody Killa)
When it comes to them bitches, I know a few
Sack chasing, blood sucking leeches with boobs
Ready to set it off, I keep â€˜em blind and lost
And if they getting lippy, they getting tossed
Just for frontin'
There's too many hoes actin' like some bitches
Not a lick of woman in them, so they get vicious
Calm me down, hold me back
Light the blunt, and let me hit it
Before this 'rat get smacked
It's like me and Grundy, can spot a chicken coming
Bobbling her head, ready to gobble dick or something
Putin' up with hoodrats for years
Because the streets of the D, are just oh so clear
But I keep on riding, say what's up
I'm a sucka for some titties, and a fine ass butt
Its the life of a killer, true tales with no glitches
Too much game, brings 2 many bitches for real

(Chorus 2x)
2 many bitches wanna see this thug
When I be
Ridin' (Ridin')
Glidin' (Glidin')
Doin' a buck twenty-five on I-94

(Blaze)
My calendar's filled
Hoe's making appointments to get it drilled
Met a chick with a phat ass, couldn't wait to get in that (Who?)
She said her name was Karen
And she didn't mind sharing time
She stayed off I-94 and Outer Drive
I'm on my way to see Carol from Grandview
Guess I could stop through, and beat it up for a few
Creep in through her doorway, and told her to drop them britches
You ain't the only one, I got 2 many bitches (hooty hooo)

(Anybody Killa)
Hey bitch where your girls at?
Tell them grab they shit, and meet me in the back
I'm about to put them in a new situation
Life of luxury, you, your girls and me
I'm so glad that you took the opportunity
To come to the underground
And open up yourself to me
But there's so many others out there just like you
So I'm off to the next 'cause we through
Thanks again!

(Chorus 2x)
2 many bitches wanna see this thug
When I be
Ridin' (Ridin')
Glidin' (Glidin')
Doin' a buck twenty-five on I-94

(Repeat till fades)
Doin' a buck twenty-five on I-94
