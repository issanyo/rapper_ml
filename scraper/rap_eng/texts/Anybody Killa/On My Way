[Verse 1:]
I'm on my way and I'm moving top speed
Ain't no looking back so don't even wave to me
I'm going for a time to chase what I believe
In other words I'm following my dreams
So many set they mind to do the same
Even if it seems a little strange (They still do it)
Take my advice, that there's more in life to gain
If you just willing to fight through the pain (and keep kicking!)

[Hook:]
Can't nobody change me or what I believe
So I make it a need to go out and achieve
Outdone by no one, new life's test run
Thought my time was up but the journey has just begun
Can't nobody change me or what I believe
So I make it a need to go out and achieve
Outdone by Gods son, new life's test run
Thought my time was up but the journey has just begun

[Verse 2:]
This life we live, the struggles we face
The path we're on, the moves we make
At any time can all be replaced
Like a memory in your head just being erased
So I'll move on just to keep the lead
And make sure that nobody gets in front of me (look out)
It's like I can't stop now
Cause the power that I feel when I'm hearing the crowd (Juggalo!)
It's just so addicting (FAMILY! FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY...)
The love that you get with no sight of friction (FAMILY! FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY...)
Will keep you moving til you're all worn out
But that's the type of feeling that I'm talking about!

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I got the secret and it changed my mentality
Now I'm pushing all my energy into the galaxy
Like a Jager Bomb, gives you personality
I'm on my way, so don't try to come after me (get out my way!)
Advertise every time they criticize
Instead of looking deep into what's real in our eyes so realize...
Some look at us as a joke
And get upset cause they got choked when they tried to provoke

[Hook x2]
