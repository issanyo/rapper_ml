[Verse 1:]
You can't fuck with us, nope not gunna happen
And you can spend your whole life rappin', BITCH!
We on a higher level, a bigger plateau
Way above looking down on them weak hoes
We got the game locked ain't nobody comin through
No ones around to hold us down even if they wanted to
So take a step back (move aside out the way)
The underground is comin through the family is here to stay
Its time to recognize really whats in front of you
Paranormal music with a rhythm you can boogie to
Giving you hot flashes, making your body shake
Feeling the bass between your toes like you in an earthquake
So keep your head banging we know you like it rough
I feel the same sometimes I can't get enough
That's how we do undeniably the hardest
And guaranteed to life to go the farthest

[Chorus]
BRACE YO SELF and hold tight because tonight is gunna be a long ride
NO ONE ELSE can do this like us because they mind ain't right
All I KNOW is when it comes to the hatchet we attach it
AND THAT'S FHO SHO cause its impossible to fuck with psychopathic (WHOOP WHOOP)

[Verse 2:]
Heads crackin' when we rappin, brains melt and leak out
Bout to fuckin freak out, and put a bullet in your mouth
Down south up north from the east to the west
Be some downest mother fuckers that'll put you to rest
For me, cut, bleed, and die so very slowly
Leave your body holey, cut my initials so you know me
Homie, ABK and AMB Representing family
That's the way its gunna be dropping haters rapidly
Yo Yo Brace your self
Brake yourself take the 9 millimeter and erase your self
Try to save yo self from the tribe called crazy
AMB and ABK we fade your face piece
Chop a little out of the top of your shoulder
Take the engine out of a lawn mower, make an explosive
Put it under your front seat for fuckin with ottis...
Don't act like a never told ya.. to brace yo self

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Brace yo self and hold on tight if I were you I would not let go
You cross that line into are are domain now we have to kill you slow
Ain't no escaping there's no way out now you belong to us
Now your exposed to the underground so you can see who not to trust!
Psychopathic automatic fresh shit on the mind
Ain't nobody cut this we stay hardest from the grind
Brace yo self cause when we hit your dome its goin splat
Better be ready for the attack with an ax, hatchet, or gat
You can never stop are face in with the boots I wear
I'd be surprised if they fit and I'm a size 10 playa
Industries your name is chump change, you ain't worth shit!
Your whole life is just a joke like a comedy bit
Right Right 7 inches worth the butcher knife stuck inside your hooker wife
Just cause she was lookin right every time we do a show I take the show and take a life
Brace yo self and say goodnight underground scrub life BITCH
We ax murdering the industries and killing anybody
Hidden in the ally creeping through there lobby's
Red and black we at war and we ready to fight
So you better brace yo self and hold on tight!

[Chorus]
