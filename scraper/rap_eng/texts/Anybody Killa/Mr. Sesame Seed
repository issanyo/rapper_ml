[Intro:]
"Nah man not this motherfucker ass."
"Don't let him light it up."
"No man we tight you go ahead and smoke that all to yourself dawg"

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Here he comes in his ice cream truck once again
Selling bags of bullshit when its gonna end?
Having little ass kids that don't know any better
Smoking bags of mud dust and calling it shredder
You could eat your weed just pop it in like popcorn
Because its all seeds and it's god damn wrong
I chase fags like you when you show me the bag
For trying to insult my smarts with this fucking schwag
I smoke crumble and get so high I can't see
Come down and then I got your ass standing before me
With a bag of barn floor like "Trying to smoke one up"
Mr. sesame fucking seed ass shut up
You need punch for every headache hit that I took
Fuck off my jock before I rock your block
And send you back to your connect with your eyes swollen money gone but your weed ain't stolen "keep that shit"

[Hook:]
Mr. Sesame Seed, there's something wrong with your bag
It's more seed than its weed, more stems and sticks out to had
A man tell me something: What the fuck is wrong with you?
(Fuck is wrong with you?)
Bitch ass motherfucker, what the fuck is wrong with you?
(Fuck is wrong with you?)

[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
Sesame seed no bun for a bag
Instead of weed you should call it little pebbles and crack
What? You got a bag of jawbreakers mixed with dirt
Why is it that every time I smoke my nose bleed and head hurt?
I ain't buying your shit no more I swear
Need the sticky icky green with the bright white glare
Keep stepping! "Can't sell here!"
Don't need your blunts popping burning facial hair
I would rather quit smoking then buy your drama
Nightmares in my sleep about the seed man monster
Chasing me down, serving me up
Seed weasel goes pop when the pipes lit up
When now your ache same old thing
Pillow case all bloody with my head on sting
I'm aggravated but what can I do?
Weed man wanna be whats wrong with you?

[Hook:]
Mr. Sesame Seed, there's something wrong with your bag
It's more seed than its weed, more stems and sticks out to had
A man tell me something: What the fuck is wrong with you?
(Fuck is wrong with you?)
Bitch ass motherfucker, what the fuck is wrong with you?
(Fuck is wrong with you?)

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I seen the artificial dope man selling bags of trick
It was just crumb without the next straight up bullshit
I pulled the car over and I beat his ass down
For even trying to sell it even at a hundred a pound
We must rid the earth, it's wrong it exists
Either way we always end up smoking his shit
All you over riding fuckers all you gots is seeds
And your shit look like a fucking bag of Rice Crispies
My weed man gets the shit and poured it from his suit
And these rainforest riding on spinning 24's
And you ride around the neighborhood on a unicycle
Selling that wrong to people who don't know right, though
So get bitched slapped off it and cough up them green bags
I'm eating at your weed sack bitch you eating that
I'm beating that ass for them headache bags
It's cause cause of you people don't even smoke like Shaggz

"That's the fuck I'm saying man. Y'all motherfuckers sell some drankey ass shit man. Y'all sell stems and seeds and shit. If I'm gonna smoke I'm gonna smoke some premium"

[Hook:]
Mr. Sesame Seed, there's something wrong with your bag
It's more seed than its weed, more stems and sticks out to had
A man tell me something: What the fuck is wrong with you?
(Fuck is wrong with you?)
Bitch ass motherfucker, what the fuck is wrong with you?
(Fuck is wrong with you?)

[Verse 4: Anybody Killa]
I don't need no sesame seed, I don't need no sticks and hay
You ain't gonna sell that shit that weeds more like a give away
Raffle it off to little kids for there school lunch change
Walking through the neighbor hood selling joints of bird seed grain
Voice all raspy, clothes really stink
Smelling like a bonfire, what you think?
And got the nerve to ask where I've been
Far the fuck away from u and your bag of peanut friends
No hard feelings but your shit sucks
After breaking down an ounce I only got 3 blunts
So fuck you weed man stop selling
I'm not a fucking snitch but I'm in the mood for telling

[Hook:]
Mr. Sesame Seed, there's something wrong with your bag
It's more seed than its weed, more stems and sticks out to had
A man tell me something: What the fuck is wrong with you?
(Fuck is wrong with you?)
Bitch ass motherfucker, what the fuck is wrong with you?
(Fuck is wrong with you?)
