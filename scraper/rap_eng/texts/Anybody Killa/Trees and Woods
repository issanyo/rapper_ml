You ever chase after death?
People chase after death everyday
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)
And don't even realize
But watch out, watch out, ya never know
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)

[Hook] -x2
I've ran through the trees and the woods
Chasing after you, chasing after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)

[Verse 1]
Did ya ever seen this comin' while you was just chillin'?
Overnight sounds so dark and thrillin'
With the quickness, I bring the sickness
Run hurry hurry run, ya really got to feel this
To the outside we look ungifted
But look deeper into yourself and prove your own existence
Treat me like I'm unfree
When neighborhoods are burnin' down to the third degree
To visualize is my own teepee
Because the hate we try to stop all began with me
Reincarnation, like it or not
But when you at death's door we gonna see what you got
Standing up on that platform
Mad as hell cause you was never well informed
I guarantee you're gonna wanna come back
With a whole new life that's so compact

[Hook] -x2
I've ran through the trees and the woods
Chasing after you, chasing after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming))

[Verse 2]
I've been chasin', but you couldn't tell
You've been hidin', but I guess you fell
Now it's something that you gotta deal with
Six feet deep all sleep for you, kid
I can't stop chasin'
Don't know what I'm facin'
Everytime I turn around I'm chasin' after you
Could this be all I am?
A trapped soul in the shell of a man?
No one would ever understand
But I guess that was the plan
So I guess I'm gonna try and relax
And only lay down straight up facts
Is there anyone out there that sees what I see
Passed on life tryin' to reach me?

[Hook] -x2
I've ran through the trees and the woods
Chasing after you, chasing after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)

[Verse 3]
Why do we feel how we feel inside?
You ever think about when it's time to die?
Not knowin' when, not knowin' how
Quittin' like a coward takin' yourself out
Livin' life chasin' after death
Ya never know how much time is left
Sure glad I can depend on y'all
Pickin' me up when I start to fall
Never makin' me feel left out
So I swear to the earth I'll never let ya doubt
That I, don't feel the same way inside
Take a good look into a killa's eyes
I'm told everywhere I go
That I'm held cause of my technique
So take ya time, and listen real slow
Cause these words are deep that I speak
Listen up, listen up

[Hook] -x2
I've ran through the trees and the woods
Chasing after you, chasing after you
(Chasing after you, and you never see it coming)

And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
Chasing after you
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
And you never seen it coming
Chasing after you
