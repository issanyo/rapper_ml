[Monoxide Child]
I'm all in the dark now
So dance with dead I can't do shit
I'm fallin' apart now
Been rottin' away in the grave since '96
I hope I'm not forgotten
Even though my body's gone
And when I'm on the bottom
Bury me with a Lotus cross
Don't nobody love me
Don't noone know the way that I feel
I'm feeling so ugly
And so I keep my casket sealed
My sprit lingers like a ghost
On the so called Earth
I'm underground, I'm a monster
Who lives in the dirt


[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Understand, certain motherfuckers jump to life
When certain concotions dumped down their windpipe
In the stomach, through the blood
And up to the dome piece
Pass out, wake up
Snappin' all necks within arms reach
I need another fixin', Southwest Delray
Green glowin' toxic bourbon
Lord have mer-say-a (Mercy)
Having to be an addict
In my nugget but I love it
And I can't seem to get enough of this shit
So fuck it

[Chorus]
Rotting souls
Let them die
Corrosion
Rotting souls
Let them die
And we don't need life
Rotting souls
Let them die
Corrosion
Rotting souls
Let them die
And we don't need life

[Anybody Killa]
Corrosion keeps creepin'
Don't let it wash you away
Scratching on the surface
Hopin' that them scars will fade
It's like I'm being eaten from the inside
And don't know why
I keep fogettin' what I'm doin'
Am I still alive?
Will I breath again?
And if I do
I'll take a breath and hold it in
Grab on tight to what I have
The chase away this life of sin
All I know is what you see
And I all do is what you get
And now I'm here affecting all that's in the range of my Lotus stick

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I come in blood eternally
The disease spreads within me
My organs turn to particles
And break down rapidly
I'm ond and grey busted and I'm startin' to decay
The new models automatic
I'm obsolete and outta date
I held six shots in one round
Enough to lay somebody down
But I'm stuck in a park
Floatin' away and waitin' to be found
My piece is breakin' away like carbine barrels
And wooden handles
What once was a gat
Is now a single round of ammo

[Chorus]
Rotting souls
Let them die
Corrosion
Rotting souls
Let them die
And we don't need life
Rotting souls
Let them die
Corrosion
Rotting souls
Let them die
And we don't need life

[Violent J]
My teeth are fucking brittle
They're soft and they hurt
I ripped my fucking penis off my nut bag
When it wouldn't work
And I be on corrosion
The mould it grows and
I try to keep my brain on ice
Crystal frozen
I'm walking up the street with a baby goat on a leash
I'm about to throw it off the over pass
One for the beast
Anything to stop the rotten erosion
Of who I am
I should motherfucking eat a fucking bullet
DO IT MAN!
Fuck that damn

[Jamie Madrox]
Broken like glass I corrode with the mode
And with like tree bark slowly I implode
I'm starting to lose a hold with what I like to call my very own
Sweater of a soul
So many more holes
Have been through the sewer grates
Turning in to grains of sand
Dragon to the undertone
And grown into a normal man
Skin will turn to black again
Souls will turn to black and then
Everyones around you lookin' like what's happenin'?

[Chorus]
Rotting souls
Let them die
Corrosion
Rotting souls
Let them die
And we don't need life
Rotting souls
Let them die
Corrosion
Rotting souls
Let them die
And we don't need life
