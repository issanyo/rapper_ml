[Verse 1]
My friends keep it real, my friends know what's up
They've turned their backs, whenever times got tough
They've always help me up, whenever I was down
They always let me know they always be around
That's why I keep 'em close, even though some far away
The one's that's dead and gone, I remember everyday
In my thoughts - they'll remain, in my heart they will stay
The one's that here with us, I pray they keep it safe
This world's not fun alone, that's why I'm rollin' crews
Have fun and wild out, some calls us "road fools"
Good times is what we have, I hang with cool ass people
No one's above theyself, all of our thoughts are equal
I always say I'm blessed, this life gave me so much
Even when shit got bad I knew my friends will be my crotch
I wouldn't give them up, I couldn't take that pain
I hope you have friends too, if not then somethings needs to change

[Hook x2]
I have some homies that are here rollin' to the end
I have some homies that are gone, my best friends
Their memory is strong, my best friends
Their soul will live on

[Verse 2]
I've got the kind of friends, that are rolling to the end
The kind your parents recommend because they don't pretend
To be someone you're not, they keep me down to Earth
My crew is worth a milion lives, so when one goes it hurts
Respect the ones you have, enjoy the fun and laugh
Be fair with all you're sharing, another words always go fast
This life is way too short, to spend it all alone
If you have friends you haven't seen - pick up that fucking phone
A little reminiscent, they say it's good for the heart
And oldschool conversations usually starts a brand new start
This goes out to my brothers, I love you all to death
And I'll represent you motherfuckers till my final breath
I've lost so many homies, some in a tragic way
And I still miss them all, until this very day
They keep my head clear when I ain't give a fuck
Shit, they were the only ones in this world that I could really trust

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Time is precious so remember - use it wisely
That's why I always try to have them live beside me
When the memories we create will last forever
The situation we get in will probably make us better
I keep my people close and think about 'em everyday
And when I see [?] pick up when we left off like nothing's changed
Ain't no shit like "where you've been?"
You ain't heard? You're still my friend
I'll be glad to see you homie anytime you pop again

[Hook x2]
