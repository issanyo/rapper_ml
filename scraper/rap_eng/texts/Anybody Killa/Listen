[Intro]
All this, all this, I can't remember your face
All this, all this, no one can take your place
All this, all this, I can't remember your face
All this pain and animosity

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
It's not everyday I get to sit around and chat
Sit down and think, maybe even talk about it
That shit just drives me crazy, fuckin' me up
I'm outta luck like a slut with nobody to fuck
Somebody talk to me, hear me out, lend me an ear
Before I lose it on society and do it so violently
Fearer of fear, hand sweaty, losin' my breath
I'm sittin' with death, somebody sittin' on my chest
Best remedy's revenge on people who wouldn't listen
Cheeks glisten cause I'm cryin', my vision is so violent
Didn't worry cause I'm losin' it, abusin' anybody
That's confusin' this with lyin' or me tryin' to get attention
Sention on my mind all I think about is dyin'
In spite of me livin' in hell, breakin' me down
Outta touch with reality, fuck it I'm out
Everybody in this motherfucker hearin' me now

[Hook]
I don't wanna lose you but I lost you
I can't remember your face
Never gonna let go, never gonna back down
No one can take your place
Why did you leave, where did you go
I don't know, why did you just go away
And leave me here with all this pain and animosity

[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]
I'm so lost without my loved ones, can't seem to let go
Why do I keep breathin' does God want me to die slow
On the edge I stand lookin' at the passed on
Wondering how long I'm allowed to carry on
So many left that was just too close
At times I feel all alone and I just can't cope
Why did they have to go, why did they have to leave
If it's not family then it's the homie from the streets
My mind says not to take this shit
But I gotta stay strong for the sake of my kid
How close does the soul gotta get to make you wanna
Slit your wrists after they heart quits
It's so hard when you lose in life but even harder
To recover, especially when memories start to smother
You can't run so just take that pain
Cause I'm a always hold on to your name rememberin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]
It's everyday that the anger seems to be killing me off
It's kinda nice to have a chance to talk
Or rather you listen to me, you always listen to me
No matter what state of mind I appear to be visited you were there for me
Even when I said that I was out of my mind
You were the one that told me give it some time
And I would find that I could put the pieces back
Together again, you were the one that trusted in me 'till the end
I can't pretend that I never had faith in you, I was only afraid
I knew what was going on but didn't know what to say
I was so young, feelin' like my soul was torn
Coming to grips with the fact you ain't comin' home no more
All this madness and all this pain made something break inside my brain
And all this hate and all this time
Made me realign my mind and I find that

[Hook x2]
