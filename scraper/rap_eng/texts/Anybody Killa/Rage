(Break)(x2)
I don't know, I don't know
What this world is coming to
All this rage, all this rage
All this rage, all this rage

(Anybody Killa)
Let me set the world straight
Fuck the hate, man you actin' fake
Walkin around like you somebody
Let me catch you in my path
You little mark, why you flinchin'?

Detroit Streets means take precaution
You and your ? means you stuffed in a coffin
All this rage means I'm fed up
Now I'm back to my old ways cause I had enough

(Lavel)
To the people on the streets with the murder mentality
Slippin' in the alley, gettin' stuck
Why the fuck must I put up with this?
I would put up a fist but muthafuckas are trippin'
Bookin' shots like a coward that graduated from power
Education ain't shit, gotcha workin' by the hour
Society got you sweatin', I suggest you take a shower
Need to pay attention, even Bin Laden gots some power

(Chorus)
All I wanna do (all I wanna do) is hit back the world with rage (im frustrated!)
All I wanna do (all I wanna do) is hit back the world with rage (im frustrated!)
All I wanna do (all I wanna do) is hit back the world with rage (im frustrated!)
All I wanna do (all I wanna do) is hit back the world with rage (im frustrated!)

(Anybody Killa)
Explosions, self destructions, this world is going under
All this murder that we do, should be used in self-defense (tell 'em again)
Explosions, self destructions, this world is going under
All this murder that we do, should be used in self-defense

Scream for help and hope somebody listens
Everybody's worried cause they loved ones is missin'
Could you tell me why does everybody have a bomb? Explosions...
Could you tell me whats the cause of this? cause of this...
Could you tell me does everybody have a bomb? Explosions...

(Chorus)
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
"SEE RIGHT NOW, WHAT THIS SHIT, RIGHT THE FUCK HERE, IS ABOUT
ITS ABOUT THE JUGGALO, MOTHERFUCKER!
UNDERSTAND, WE ALL FAMILY IN THIS BITCH
AND IF YOU AINT FAMILY THEN FUCK YOU!
IM SAYIN', BECAUSE WE ALL IN THIS BITCH TOGETHER MOTHERFUCKER!
IN ALL THIS SHIT..."
