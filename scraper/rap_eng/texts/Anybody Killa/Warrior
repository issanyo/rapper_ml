Intro: Syn

Anybody Killa, Yeah x2

ABK: Whut up y'all, welcome to the muthafuckin Regal Beagle, before we play
This next track, I want all my pimps and playas, I mean all my SINGLE, no
Lady, pimps and players to find the hottest girl in the room, and go up to
Her, and her man, and TAKE THAT BIIAATCH

[Verse 1]
Pour me a drink, time to get drunk
Roll that blunt lets get fucked up
What'chu think that I can't hang
Just because I'm stumbling
I'm a warrior bitch recognize
Sippin fire water since the age of 9
Tomahawk in my hand moccasins on my feet
Lookin for me a sqwaw to take home and freak
Straight to the teepee ,things ain't changed
Pack the peace pipe Before I hit that strange
Pop on the deer buck skin rubber
Lay her down slow on my bear hide cover
Bitch is out for the count
Cause she fucked all night and got her box banged out
Shoulda known not to fuck with me
Totem pole warrior from the 3 1 3

[Chorus - 2X]
I know you wanna be
I know you wanna be
I know you wanna be a...Warrior

[Verse 2]
You wanna be a warrior, follow me
(I can take you different places)
Down to the roots cuz the roots are the trees
(and show you all these passed on faces)
They still livin cuz they livin inside of me
(they only wanna walk the earth they wanna breathe)
Thats why I have all this crazy energy
(I'm only trying to explain)
Why I drink, and love to smoke
Regal Beagle pow wow when my robe folds off
Showin off the nub, always hangin with scrubs
Take A bath in Budweiser muthafuck a tub
Thats how we do it, I ain't playin (no)
Mud duck hood rat hoes parlayin (biatch)
Drinkin 40's while twistin a spliff
Detroit Eastside GEt WIT IT

[Chorus - 2X]
I know you wanna be
I know you wanna be
I know you wanna be a...Warrior

Break (ABK, Violent J, Madrox)

Na na na na, marijuana
Crack 40's to get by

[Verse 3]
Na na, na na na no you can't have none
Whole cakes gone, weed baggies bare
Roaches done been smoked now I'm outta here (peace y'all)
Pack up fools, time to bust
Searchin for a new sack of mother earth we trust (uh huh)
Get high stay high live high
And if you wanna go the way I go...die high
This party ain't over till the weedman sings
Spend his life behind bars they can't bring that thing
Oh we all get rated for helpin ourselves
Mary Jane got us focused now she's wanted in hell
Everybody that I go to I be keepin it real
Double shots keep em comin with a blunt to fill (yup)
Stay true to the game think big
From center buck wild see you next week kid (bye bye)

[Chorus] - 2X

[Break x 4]
Na na na na, marijuana
Crack 40's to get by (Warrior)
