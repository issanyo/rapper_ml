For The Fam Exclusive Volume 2

Look through the mind of the mind of a monster

[Verse 1: Jamie Madrox]
Monstrosity, our anthologies, new velocity
It's probably in perportion to people's disturbin' curiosity
Everyone likes a psycho, especially Twiztid freek shows
With a chain, on display, and amusement of all the people
"Look mom he's waving back at me is he actually
Sick enough to kill me and eat me after he capture me?
Or will he keep me alive?"
Picture my anamosity
The thought of me killin' you 'for I eat you is generosity!

[Verse 2: R.O.C.]
Where are the ride of sky's men?
Sick of the way that I cry when
Wish I rush stuff like a bison
While teeth are as sharp as a lycan
Utilize all of my outlets
Take me about this, no can't do that
Blew out my brains and they grew back
Blew out your brains, I'mma use that
No simply crazy and you can't get my station
I'm not even on my way, a frequency scale
My rhythmatic form, how it rips it right off the back
And our army is finicky, vengeance swells
You hatin' this male
You chopped down my sails
I'm drinkin' this shit cause I'm sick
The price of my body
Rippin' you outta my conscious for all
The nigga's a monster

[Hook]
Look through the mind of the mind of a monster
Take a look through the mind of a monster

Diabolical, diabolical, diabolical

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Gotta hit my brain right? Before I leave behind a
A murderer scene at arrival in one of your gang fights
And I'll do it in plain sight, I'm underground like a drain pipe
I'm like a monster lookin' for something to eat by daylight
Please don’t let me leave from no house
Or I’ll become the next killa the news is talkin' about
You've got nothin' more than a mouth
And I spread evil and poison, I can never be casted out

[Verse 4: ABK]
I'm just a monster
Ready to conquer all the filthy in my city
Detroit's looking destroyed, annoyed, and always dizzy
Now we all mindless lunatics, roaring with some candlesticks
Time to operate and evacuate your leadership
No apologies, I inflict what i predict
And there ain't no stopping me because my fate is to exist
Take it right back to the east where the beast was created
Awakened with opened gates and got us all motivated
Let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Priceless]
I'm an abomination
Like an Osama hatin' terroristic characteristic, as-salamu alaykum
It's twisted, it's Twiztid, spittin' lyrics, sick and exquisite
Sittin' with spirits, sippin' on spirits
Listen, you'll hear it
Dibble and dabble in black magic, the black savage
He's back at it to bring rap back cause it lacks status
Wack rap like black magnets attracts faggots
Like crack addicts are impacted by having smack habits
Mean and violent but sleeping and green giant
Like Kobe the B- ryant
The noble and king tyrant
That slipped you the crack, open the seam and ride it
We'll give you some dope shit, hope you agree and buy it

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Acie High]
I died and went to hell to holla at the devil cause I had a question
Got to talking then I realized I was in my daddy's presence
Now I'm bad for the image
They're supposed to give you your sentence
And got a regular ass nigga that's just into forensics
It's who? Me, hell's boy but with horns
Was supposed to grow em later but I got em when I was born
Poking and picking at you sickly motherfuckers with disgust
Permanent bask of a monster, I never have to adjust
