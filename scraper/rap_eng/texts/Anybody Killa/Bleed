[Otis]
If you see my head hanging low, better leave me alone
When the good vibes pass, and the weed is gone
I can't see the right, I only see the wrong
I'm just trying make a living, trying sing a song
But so many people wanna share their negative spirit
They wanna criticize my shit, and make sure I can hear it
But do you make your own beats, do you write your own lyrics?
And can you mix own song, after you engineer it?
Cause we do, if we doing shots I'mma need too
The work got me feeling like I'mma make you bleed soon
How could you look at me, and not see truth
How could you be true to everything rappers feed you
If that was my diet, I'll be throwing up on a daily
You motherfuckers making me chaotic like kelly
You trippin of what I'm sayin', and let me know I ain't playin'
I must be doing something right, to fall in your conversations about me
What I'm doing in the D, C-A-N-O-N-I-Z-E, AMB (psychoptahic family) for life
So now this industry tightest, is all afraid of me, and they should be to
Everything we do is to keeping on making you bleed through
Blood all over the car and dashboard to seats too
Bodies found bloody and bumping them AMB tunes, yeah
They try to study mine's, can't ignore the beauty in my ugly rhymes
Aside from all the women trying to fuck me
Iâ€™m such a loony guy, glad you took the time to even try my shit
But if you ain't feeling me, you will need to leave it alone
Cause I can murder, and as soonest I can leave, I'm gone
You making me mad, I got my both hands squeezing your dome, until you...

[Hook x2]
Bleed!
All enemies be afraid of me
My side ain't playin', so don't play with me
I make you, Bleed!
All enemies be afraid of me
I leave a bomb on your block, and erase the string until you'll Bleed!

[Bonez]
I think I see em, mean muggin bout the get out with
Don't forget even a little bit, you talked that shit
I come equipped with equipment to quit
You're motherfucking dome of your neck right quick
Making all them haters bleed, fucking with the G
Can't nobody see (see), killer in the AMB
Leave embedded in your memory
You ain't even living like that, put it in the rap
Anybody listening it anyway yo, holding it in my mind
But I'm about to let it go, snap on a moterfucking ho
You don't wanna cut like oh, wow, never enough blood to go around
Keep on testing me, if you know how
Knock you right in your ho ass mouth
Believe, me and my brother will be putting in work
Stepping to the family, and get your ass hurt
Among this earth, I'll never let them tell me what I be worth
And you know that I'm murdering on a daily
Let me get you sleeping on AMB, murder you right now, like pow
Now you're sleep with the deadly, come to my hood it's the undergound
Fuck with me, so I'm like "really?", do you wanna meet up with a fucking mili?
Cyanide, suicide, that's what they think
But later do they know that I pulled that drink?
Empty inside, broke that heart, till bitch give me what I need
I don't even have to drop a G, y'all do it for free
Know what I mean, make a motherfucker...

[Hook x2]

[Anybdy Killa]
Yo, let me get em one time, let me make em bleed
I'mma take till I got everything I need
Independent on my own two feet
So what I'm sayin is can't too many walk with me
I'll make you bleed from a first step, watch your pace
Cause on the road, that we're on, don't allow no hate
So if you really down to roll, with some outta control
Motherfuckers like us, come and take your place
Them Garcia Boyz, got my back
With a axe ready to murder, we're down like that
Warrior, ho, watch us creep, wickedshit till we die
It's what we're puttin' on streets
We're on the level, that we call good vibes
Cause the underground bleeds through all of our lives
Never once, will I have to think twice
To put this track on and sacrifice myself to just...
