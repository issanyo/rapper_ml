[Intro:]
Word up, we all over the stage man
Travel by train, bus, boat, car, or airplane
I do my do, do my thing
I gotta feed my family by all means necessary

We all over the stage man
I wanna be with you boo but I gotta do what I gotta do (Going out for the loot)

[Verse 1: Planetary]
It takes a lot to make your dreams come true
If I could baby know that I would leave with you
There's a lot things that me and Crypt still have to do
Our dream is way bigger than having a fan or two
I mean, the reason that I even do this now
So you never have to work and then college is figured out
Gotta leave that way so they can fill my shoes
Can't walk barefooted then the grandkids lose
And I was born to win, I gotta teach em the same
Gotta make sure they never give up and maintain
I gotta hit that stage, gotta go get paid
Gotta bring it back and flip it a couple of different ways
Don't miss me at all boys, just hold me down
Help mines with the baby once I go outta town
Don't trip, I'm still just a phone call away
I'm still here every day if you need me either way

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze]
And it feels like I'm a million miles from home
Missing your face, envisioning your smile through the phone
I miss my girl, my baby, and all that I know
But I'm out the door, another tour, another timezone

And it feels like I'm a million miles from home
Missing your face, envisioning your smile through the phone
I miss my girl, my baby, and all that I know
But I'm out the door, another tour, another timezone

[Verse 2: Reef the Lost Cauze]
As I lay here watching you peacefully sleep
My son against your chest, heartbeat to heartbeat
Searching for the right words to speak
Trying hard not to weep
Gotta be strong for y'all I am weak
Feels like forever but it's only a couple of weeks
I'll be gone but baby doll I'm never out of reach
Plus the squad is chilling right up the street
Any problems call up? he light up the street
She laughed, told me don't trip, it's not an issue
Just know I'm gonna miss you, from her purse she pulled a tissue
Can I kiss you? I ask as I grab her sleeve
My son looking at me like, "Daddy, don't leave."
The hardest part of touring life, leaving the babies and your wife
You think you can make this your life?
It ain't easy hurting hearts and I'm home again
But for now papa back on the road again

[Interlude:]
Word up, we all over the stage man
Travel by train, bus, boat, car, or airplane
I do my do, do my thing
I gotta feed my family by all means necessary

We all over the stage man
I wanna be with you boo but I gotta do what I gotta do (Going out for the loot)

[Verse 3: Crypt the Warchild]
When you see my bags packed save the attitude
Maybe show appreciation, a little gratitude
I know it's hard when I bounce, I ain't mad at you
But this is all I got, something that I have to do
Cause there's a lot I provide with a mic and a beat
Like the roof on our head plus the light and the heat
The little things that make our cipher complete
I just ask you hold me down for a couple of weeks
And I got my passport ready, time to cash in
Rock shows crazy, look how they packed in
Most cats came through it cause they lack gems
Plus their biz ain't correct, they can't rip up the set
Seven shows in a row, that's a vicious cycle
Long journey on a bus got me going psycho
No sleep till Philly, I'm a little stressed
I'm back home, got a feeling I ain't never left
