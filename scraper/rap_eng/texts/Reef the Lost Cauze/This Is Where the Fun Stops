You need to know who you fucking with now
Now kill-a-kill again ain't nobody stopping this now
Now who want what we got
Real deal hip-hop, even with my shit chop
You need to know who you fucking with now
Now kill-a-kill again, ain't nobody stopping this now
When you listen to my shit you don't chew, you don't breathe
You don't miss a fucking line

[Verse 1] -- Reef the Lost Cauze
Motherfucking classic
I'm an animal, yeah a lot like a monkey
And my pride is too sick, dawg you not gonna chump me
And my squad is too thick, you not gonna jump me
I'll knock you over fucking wall like Humpty Dumpty
I'm the king of the castle, king of the battle
I'll dumb out like King when he gamble
And I'm classic like LL's Kangol
Overseas running the streets with Hells Angels
You at home, playing with Wii
Nintendo, negro stop playing with me
I am the best, c'mon say it with me
Fuck rappers, Reef is my favorite MC, word
I'm an only comp, you'll get stolen, stomped
You's a mama's boy, your bitch still folds your socks
You don't want beef and I'm so shocked
My niggas can't hold jobs, they just know to hold Glocks
It's not my fault I spaz a lot
What you expect? I came up under Paz and 'Mach
Came from behind, Taji, Tariq, and Koran
City of Philly, I am the evil of spine
Yeah, I'm bad news
Especially when you see me with the white boy with tattoos
We'll fucking smash you
It's Lost Cauze, illegal with the Snowgoons
You ain't know I'll be back, banging you so soon

[Hook] -- Reef the Lost Cauze
This is where the fun stops
This is purple haze, drunk rock
This is knife wounds and gun shots
This shit here, vulgar and trife
The words that I write, the illest shit you heard in your life
This is where the fun stops
This is purple haze, drunk rock
This is knife wounds and gun shots
This shit here, vulgar and trife
The words that I write, the illest shit you heard in your life, word

[Reef the Lost Cauze:]
Well maybe not, but I'm crazy hot
And the world is mine, but the baby's not
Always lighting up drugs, wilding in the club
I'm not grown and sexy, I'm childish and smugs
Stay in ya lane stupid or drink brain fluid
Niggas in Philly trying to be the next Frank Lucas
We don't talk out our problems, we banging through it
And Crypt is my Blood, but we ain't gang-influenced
I'm in the Dodge with Plan', trying to dodge the man
Trying to get rich, what part of the plan don't you comprehend, Einstein?
Don't need to repeat, just say my name one time
And I will be there to spit your frame
I rock you stalagmites, crystal cave
I'll break ya arms, then start ordering shots like
J채gerbombs, J채gerbombs, J채gerbombs, J채gerbombs

[Hook]

[Outro] -- Reef the Lost Cauze
Yeah, Snowgoons, Reef the Lost Cauze
We like three for three right now, batting about a hundred
You motherfuckers suck
That's why you can't come over here and record shit
Nobody wants you; you don't need to get a fucking passport
There's no reason
Me? I'm worldwide bitch, I'm all over this motherfucker
I might pop up in motherfucking Sweden one day and motherfucking UK the next
Germany, Switzerland, and then be back in Philly on the block like I ain't got shit
Cause you niggas will not rob me
Call me what you will, just don't call me
And don't call Stress neither
Yeah, all of a sudden right you got love for us now right?
Take a number, just not mine
Lost Cauze, I'll see y'all in '08
I'm learning German up in this motherfucker
Know what I'm saying? I'm bilingual... one!

Danke
