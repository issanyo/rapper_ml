[Intro]:
Yeah, yeah. Ladies and gentlemen. We got Reef The Lost Cauze and Eyego/Direct in the house tonight. They'd like to play one of their new tunes. It's pretty funky

[Verse One]:
Yo, I punch niggas in the face for livin', disgrace the system
Counterparts wilin' 'til we state prison
Used to tape Prism for videos of hockey games
Spittin' in the mirror, no lie, I used to copy Kane
This not be game, this is real life
Spittin' since '89 motherfucker, I'm still nice
Yellow pad, black pen, I still write
I always said y'all couldn't make albums, I'm still right
I'm live action, you movin' still like
Quick as a cat kill mice I crush steel mics
That makes me Superman homie
So I murder you, you, you and your stupid ass homie
Line 'em up
Anyone who want to see the man
Don't slap me five, I'll fuck around and eat your hand
I'm gon' ruin your life, you're gon' give me a hand
I don't even rhyme I just came here to see the band

[Hook]:
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
I've been nice since I was on a big wheel
I'm Reef The Lost Cauze, I'm kind of a big deal
Spit straight from the heart, you know this shit's real
So what you rhyme homie, big deal
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?

[Verse Two]:
I get trapped in between the lines
Just cause I rap don't mean you won't get clapped between the eyes
You think you nice, I'm actually surprised
You a tranny understand me, not naturally a guy
I got the trashiest mind and get nasty as swine
Koch is the label of what they asked me to sign
I want the fuckin' paper
You sharp as some scissors they used to use to cut construction paper
Since kindergarten
I've been retarded
Literally
Look at this shit you started!
Damn that was wrong of me
Motherfuckers can not name one wack song from me
And if they can't they don't know good music
It ain't real to me unless the hood approves it
So keep a quiet tongue, before I fire guns
Like blaaow!

[Hook]:
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
I've been nice since I was on a big wheel
I'm Reef The Lost Cauze, I'm sort of a big deal
Spit straight from the heart, you know this shit's real
So what you rhyme homie, big deal
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?

[Verse Three]:
Try to spar with me your mind will melt
They used to praise Jesus and whip slaves
That's why they call they self the Bible Belt
I started my own label, just to sign myself
I'm always sayin' I'm the illest just to remind myself
He's major cake, three layers
You just a motherfuckin' fall guy, Lee Majors
I was the kid in the class who would always eat paper
I spit darts, you a big prick, cheap razor
I'm the illest in the game, the east savior
Any rhyme bout, no doubt, Sharif favored
And if not, you better check those odds
I be right at your door, you better check those logs
No new tricks, I don't respect those dogs
I pull up pipes on you, like we 'bout to check for clogs
If we can't make payroll
We stickin' up white boys at St. Joe's, let's go Hawks!

[Hook]:
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
I've been nice since I was on a big wheel
I'm Reef The Lost Cauze, I'm sort of a big deal
Spit straight from the heart, you know this shit's real
So what you rhyme homie, big deal
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
How ya feel about it?
