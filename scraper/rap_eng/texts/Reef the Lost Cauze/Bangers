[Verse One: King Magnetic]
King Mag and Reef on the same disc
Your guns are borrowed, y'all gon' reach for the same shit
Collab with calibers, stab them challengers
Days are numbered and you sweet inside, Advent calendars
Seen on, Black Christmas
I don't mean Kwanzaa
I don't need not a one of you to do what I gotta
Not a shooter, you get shot at
I'll have my niggas rob your session
And don't have to stress 'em to get my gwap back
Stack on top of that
Feds ain't stoppin' that
Give a rapper a banger, I don't mean stocking cap
We gon' make it cause I hold you down
Attack mode till new joints are oldies now
Golden crown controls the pound like digi scales
Downloads bubble and double my digi sales
Thisis50.com, you can find me now
I'm a Shady contractor, 50 should sign me now

[Reef The Lost Cauze]
I be puffin' all kind of grass
I beat you down with an Umbrella
Like Chris Brown did to Rihanna ass
Yeah that's kinda sad
Like your little raps
It's the new Malachi and Lil' Dap
I seen your perform before and ain't a nigga clap
Don't confuse it with real life, this is rap
A fabrication of someone else's imagination
It's what makes you niggas try to act Jamaican
What the bumbaclot?
You really got a Glock?
You really slung the rocks?
Man you'se a fuckin' cop
I see the wire in your shirt dude
This is a chess game
Tell me homie, what's your first move?
I'll never be a pawn, you'll never see the don
Why now-a-days, rappers dress like PM Dawn?
We still rock Timbs stuff
13 bucks in the store, catch us on tour for 10 bucks

[Reef talking]
Nigga. That's a CD price nigga
