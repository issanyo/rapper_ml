[Verse One: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I make a hundred moves, kill a hundred crews
Ninja Turtle style, cowabunga dude
How I'm gonna move?
How I'm gonna chose between rap or nothing, I ain't got nothing to lose
You got something to prove but nothing to gain
A record deal man, the internet fuck up the game
It ain't about that
It ain't about rap
It's about trying to free my mind and get about that
This is therapeutic, this is cherished music
You're animalistic, I'm barracudic
Beware the Judas in the garden raking leaves
You trying to write rhymes but I keep breaking the trees
Keep waiting to squeeze
Waiting in Paris
Fuck a nickle bag baby I'm blazing an ounce
How can you speak when you stay a dick in your mouth
I'm amazed you still ain't figured it out
The triggers is out
So I squeeze
Bah bah
So I squeeze
Bah bah
So I squeeze
Bah bah
So I squeeze

[Hook: Reef The Lost Cauze]
And I bleed and I breathe and I'm bound on my knees
Begging the Lord please let me be
When I leave when I squeeze when I bleed when I breathe
When I'm down on my knees just begging you please

[Verse Two: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Save me father
My father ain't raised me father
It made me harder
It made me smarter
It made me a martyr
Made me feel pain
Never harbored it just increased uh
It is in me
So it's either your motherfucking face or you let this pen leak
God meant me to rip shop
What does it mean when you say I am hip hop?
Nothing, get it?
No one can tell you it's real
Just smoke something and do what you feel
Yeah, I'm on that Snoop shit, I'm on that new shit
I'm on that fuck you pay me, what's this recoup shit?
My new bitch look like Dawn from En Vogue
Hard to keep a girl I be gone on the road
But I gotta eat baby and the streets made me
A hustler, I even fuck on my feet lately
This beat crazy
I'ma let that bitch breathe
And she crazy so I'ma let that bitch breathe
Dig? Dig?

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Reef The Lost Cauze]
From the edge of Hell where the dead's for sale
Gun slingers abound sling Webster's well
Peter Parker like
Red and blue Air stats on my feet, call 'em my Peter Parker Nikes
My Spidey senses I climb these fences
The king of kings, don't mind these princes
Princess, this is my castle
Stay sober or get high, this is my battle
And I'm losing, it depends on your ass
They said you ain't snitch it depends who you ask
You can beat the case homie, depends on the cash
Cause justice is just a prostitute pimping her ass
Yo, I jump from topics like you jump to crotches
Canal street nigga bout as real as they watches
Lyrics they Jordans I'm really important
And no one important my album's done, it ain't recorded
It's in my head though
I gotta let that bitch breathe
I feel dead though
So sometimes I just squeeze
So I squeeze
Bah bah
So I squeeze
Bah bah
So I squeeze
Bah bah
So I squeeze
