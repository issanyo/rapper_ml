[Verse 1]
That's the sound that my lady makes
Pretty young thing, grown ass with a baby face
She's a tasty cake, with a tasty cake
She get mad be like baby dont make me wait
Too long, finish your songs, Im drippin in thongs
10 minutes till dawn, we still gettin it on
She love when I stroke that
She might as well be a quarter back the way she throw that
Call me Randy Moss, take your panties off
Sweet as candy corn let the camera 'cord, porn not amateur
Dammnit girl, got her up on the banister
Its spectacular, lookin at the back of her
Watchin her grind that, I love bein behind that
Good god that behind fat
She a dime sack, hydro dime sack
Blaze too, phase two, come now rewind that

[Hook]
And the party dont stop till we (Look at the sun)
Yeah, shorty said she wanna rock till we (Look at the sun)
Shorty said she wanna dance till we (Look at the sun)
Yeah, yeah, see im trynna get in'her pants till we (Look at-)
Romance till we (Look at the sun)

[Verse 2]
Uh uh, dont you go to sleep yet
Im full of gin and I ain't feelin' weak yet
I tell you what lets take a quick recess
Then we wander back in to the freak fest
You know that thing is my weakness
You climbed the mountain, but you ain't reached the peak yet
I got a whole lotta skeet skeet skeet left
Got her screaming out Oh Lord Jesus
He can't save ya, your man had to leave cause he couldn't take ya
I can handle that, she got a hump like a camel back
Tell you the truth I dont know how you stand with that
All that cake, hi Betty Crocker
My cocks that crack, Im ready to rock ya
Heavy cock ya, I can control myself dog but I can't stop her

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Its a quarter to 6, we still caught in the mix
No need to speak when she talk wit her lips
Get the innuendo, work it out till her skin soaked
So much heat between the sheets you see thick smoke
Risin' up, ask me to tie her up
Never did it but shit I'm down to try it once
Apple pie for lunch, she got that recipe
My favorite drug, she got that ecstasy
To the same effect
What we do too raw to name it sex
Lets call it something different
Started in the basement, now we're crawling in the kitchen
Switching alternate positions, its awesome how I'm living
I wish, I wish I could give you this feelin'
But I can't cause she whipped and won't try nothing different
And my friend thats what they call pimpin'

[Hook]
