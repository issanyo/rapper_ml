[Verse One: King Magnetic]
It's the King, The Cauze, the bing, the bars
The skin, the scars, the limbs, the gauze
Next known body that, X hold shotty cat
Roger that, lodging that right inside your Dodger cap
The odds of that, more than that, margin gap
The artists that they marvel at
A starving cat, involving gat, evolve from that
I brawl for that, off of that
Medicine, the veterans is gettin' slim
The evidence, my presence is unprecedented
I'm reminiscing of a demolition
Over premonition of a dead division
Many risen, many prisons overcrowded
The powers won't allow it
Get devoured by the sour when the powels in the bowels
Them hours that them cowards is hidin' from
Colliding one, size my gun
If I was you, I would run
Leaving either lung
Reach inside my trunk
And leave Philly with my team like I'm Iverson

[Reef the Lost Cauze talking]
I go by Reef The Lost Cauze. Mmmhuuhahahah

[Verse Two: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Yo, who the fuck you think you talkin' to
I'll fuckin' destroy all of you
The Cauze, you dudes running into walls that I'm walkin' through
They see my face in the game, they call audibles
Offing you, junkyard dogs, Sargent Slaughter you
Before you open your trap, here's what you outta do
Fuck you pay me, need cash before I talk to you
I need cash, to cop me another Glock
The industry make me sick, the industry can suck my cock
I don't need none of you, consider me a favor
I don't need none of you, consider me a hater
You don't know me, consider me a stranger
Independent for life, they consider me a major
Never a star gazer, I am so space
Show up to your showcase, leave you with a broke face
Holding pipes, run up on your open mic
And you'll never be shit except unimpressive and over hyped

[Verse Three: Crypt The Warchild]
We contract killers, sign the line there's no clause
In the City Of God we obey no laws
We renegade, we razor blade with steady aim
Heavy rain of kerosene makin' deadly flames
Hood paradise, slum merchant with his gun squirtin'
We can't live in peace cause we the only ones hurtin'
Keep my mind in space but leak Pharaoh blood
Keep my words engraved on a hollow slug

[Planetary]
It's the Army, and what that means is
I'm worldwide and my goals and dreams is big
I'm sittin' on top of stars, the moon and the sun
When I rap, I'm backed by some goons with guns
I crack jaws like Marciano with brass knuckles
It's real life my nigga, we way past the hustle
We linked up with The Returners now the heads is turnin'
And how the fuck did y'all sleep when the beds are burnin'?
