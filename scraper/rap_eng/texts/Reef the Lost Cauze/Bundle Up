[Intro]
The Lost Cauze. My nigga Emynd on the beat, whattup? Bear One. It's a cold winter. Bundle up nigga. It's getting cold out there. Let's go. Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Yeah it's winter time that means it's winner time
My niggas hungry out there, boy it's dinner time
The flow matured lovely, it's been refined
Hip hop ain't dead, but it's in decline
Hall of fame shit boy, I'm in the shrine
Till the sun come up boy, I'm in the grind
I lay low, just plotting while I twist the vine
Grey Goose, cran-apple with a twist of lime
If there's not Dutchies, well then a Swisher's fine
Come to one of our jams you've got to get in line
This is Philly nigga and we getting shine
Ain't worried about the next nigga cause I'm getting mine
Bout to blow the fuck like I'm hitting mines
He say he nicer than me he sniffing lines
Same nigga forever, it's just a different time
Fuck who got the bigger gun I got the bigger mind

[Hook: Samples Freeway's 'What We Do'] {x2}
"We still hustle till the sun come up"
Man we hustle forever
"Crack a 40 when the sun go down"
Y'all niggas bundle up

[Verse 2]
It's freezing in fact
Shout out to Freezer and Jak
Reef on the track and pack is like a liter of Jack
I blaze the reefer to relax
All I'm seeing is stacks
All I'm speaking is facts
All I'm eating is rats
Put the 40 to the shorty's face
You ain't real nigga
We just seen you on First 48
Crack the 40 late
Banned in 40 states
We got mouths to feed, it's like 40 plates
Can't just make due, it ain't a game fool
Go extra hard, extra yards, Maurice Jones Drew
Emynd, Bo Blizz, I got the same crew
Never you clown niggas jumping through flamed hoops
Fuck your solo career and your lame group
I know brilliant men who never had that break through
They sitting on the same stoop
Y'all see how the game do
That's why we out here on the chase nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sure as the sun should rise, raising this son of mine
To learn that out here you never too young to die
Drinking bottles till the rum is dry
My heart beats for the doe and so it make me come alive
I ain't got time for the sham rumors
I'm in Japan stupid, eating lamb skewers ya damn loser
You can't bruise us
My style is the truest
I can freestyle but need a couple thousand to prove it
Mad projects, no housing of units
Just albums of music that lead a crowd wild with amusement
How did I do it?
Cop chief and flip hard big dawg
With a thick broad while you play soft [?]
Suspect, counting money I ain't touch yet
If rap don't work there's always drug/sex
I own my own home, you couldn't sublet
I move dubs on the step that is dubstep

[Hook]
