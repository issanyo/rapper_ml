[Verse 1: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Set 'em niggas raised the banners up
I carry canisters the size of San Fri', Atlanta
It's the amateur, how your pop feel his son is a faggot?
Planting my seed in your girl, now she the mother of dragon
Clowns to the left, jokers to the right
I left a path of dead rappers strangled with broke mics
Take it back to that M.O.P. - Cold As Ice
If you beat everyone already, who are you supposed to fight?
Challengers explode like the NASA rocket
'Cause they ain't know the mutherfuckin' time like bad watches
I drop mad projects, they all ill
I summon brothers, come for you
They all will
Who did y'all rob? Who did y'all kill?
Silence - like a fucking mime in Vaudeville
I put your pride through a sawmill
Y'all don't deserve the remains of a dog's meal, so dog chill
I speak in a tongue called elephant
My brain is a device not fully developed yet
What you hearing is the prototype
Before you wager against me ask if you can afford your life?

[Hook] x2
Yeah, you know me well
The god said that they owe me hell
I'm the outlaw Josey Wales
No heaven above, no hell beneath me
No man can kill me, no bitch can keep me

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid child, please come and look
The journal that holds my rhymes is called The Jungle Book
Shere Khan, weed white, beer bronze
I used to be afraid of my power - the fear's gone
So now all of those who were dead challenge
Left screaming in the back as I'm tearing the Bear's ballads
You go to brunch meetings and eat pear salads
I won't deny my feelings of hate, 'cause they valid
I have a rare palate; taste unparallel
The weight of the world on my back, but I wear it well
The secret of success, what is there to tell?
If you fail to prepare, then you must prepare to fail
I'm spitting ill, the fist be my hammer
The question of who the illest?
This be the answer
There is no madness
There is no method
Yours truly, Lost Cause the lion and the leopard

[Hook] x2
Yeah, you know me well
The god said that they owe me hell
I'm the outlaw Josey Wales
No heaven above, no hell beneath me
No man can kill me, no bitch can keep me
