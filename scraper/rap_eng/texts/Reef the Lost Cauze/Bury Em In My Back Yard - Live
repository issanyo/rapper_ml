[Verse]:
I'm the antidote to manic folks
I speak to 'em through this vocal box like an old man with a can to throat
Your squad is sweeter than the banana float and your man is dope
As a book of notes filled with MC Hammer quotes
I dam your mote
Cut ya like cantaloupe, it's Lost Cauze
I'm hard like gettin' a black man to vote
MC's get shook up and popped like a can of Coke
When I paint pictures the fire is such that the canvas chokes
In broken English you can a cope
I pass the mic, MC's wanna wash they hands in soap
No Dial or sess can remove the bile from your flesh
That I spew with you, just cause you tried to test
My soul purpose, MC's is so worthless
They got no bars like a celly with no service
I murk shit, doctors, nurses, coffins, hearses
Swim in mud shirtless, still come out dirtless
Trife and sick, ice ya clique
Kill ya dogs, bury 'em in my backyard like Michael Vick
Watch your back son
This with a track son
It's Lost Cauze and I be the one to smack son
You better know I come with the illest traction
And fucked up more little white children than Michael Jackson
