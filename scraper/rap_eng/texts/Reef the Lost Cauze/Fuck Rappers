[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze] (x4)
I am the best, come on say it with me:
Fuck rappers, Reef is my favorite MC

[Verse 1]
This beat is snappin'
The streets is crackin'
This beat is madness
Release the Kraken
Oh Yes. We bag it
Oh yes we back and you are gonna feel this shit
It’s the Snowgoons and I’m fucking frostilicus
Just an animal that wandered in straight from the wilderness
And I ain't Youtube when I say I got a million clips
Passing years, me and my peers
Tell me homie, who rappin' better?
Who kill the track?
Who brought Philly back?
Nigga, check that track record
Yeah, you heard, right?
Yeah, I said my words right
Live from Germany and iron like the Third Reich
That was his third strike
Game off the plate
And my wolves have you screaming: "Please get 'em off my face!"
Uh, Too late
Now you food for the dogs
Raw food for them, nigga
I bring the pain
Open up your brain
Straight up won't refuse a funeral, nigga
When I rock my sock, go straight, straight to the roof of them, nigga
What I say next day, nothing but the honest truth, little nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Y'all know I birthed you
I changed and burped you
I'm your fucking daddy
I got you your pair of first shoes, I dipped them in gold
I'm vicious and cold
I get this spit and fasten shit, like I listen to bone
These niggas wanna jam with the best, but they're soft as butter be
B fuck with me son I be utterly dumping these wannabes underneath Sunny Creek
Kids dressing like Young MC
I’m one of these OGs pouring Sunny D
With a ton of weed and a gat under me
Got the MAC with me like Always Sunny see
Bitch nigga, chill
This nigga ill
When I rhyme, I'm like this nigga still
Trying, I'm dying
I like it if this nigga got killed
For the hell of it
I blaze that kush for the smell of it
We got that La-La
Blaze that La-La like that boy Carmelo’s bitch
You write poems
And make mellow hits
I'm on the felons list, for the best in this
May you rest in shit
You wretched prick
I get arrested if the way I’m blessing shit that sets a precedent you know the rest of it

[Hook]
