[Intro]
Yeah, you know who the fuck it is
It's Captain Caveman motherfucker
Bout to drag you motherfuckers by your hair
Lost Cauze
My man Le Greck, Mythologia
Lets go, AOTP fucker

[Verse 1]
Aiyo may God forgive me, Im bout to shove a rod inside your kidney
You fucking kids be picking in these as little as pigmies
Im 260 when the gun is present, I'll eat your lungs for breakfast
You've never seen the impact of such a weapon
An animal man, my beard is an animals mane
Get your family maimed, I'm Cannabis Cane
Chris and Chris, not cross dog
Run in pop off, vodka, how quick I pop your top off
Talks off cause I'm heavy handed
Or your tongue will be directly placed where the machete is planted
Slice it off and place it in a Durrell box
This tale stops, when your hearts been placed in a mailbox
Special delivery, I had an epiphany
I'm viscously visually lyrically making history
Dissing me, simply to be, the end of your misery
Feast your fucking face like Star Wars, homie, I'm Billy Dee

[Hook]
*Scratching*
Tryin' to tell him that its the flow son
*Scratching*
Tryin' to tell him that its the flow son
*Scratching*
Dont compare me to you nigga, you ain't this

[Verse 2]
Take another look, a definition it wasn't shook
My weeds a redneck indian named Bubba Kush
I miss Bubbachuck, that's (?) for you (?)
A bitch is mine forever, homie, if I fuck her once
Or I'll stalk her crazy
Won't take long before you start to praise me, cause the art of lazy hits the heart like baby
The pages I write on are thank you letters
And I'll fucking crush you, if you think you better
Think you never did none of that wild shit
I'm childish, you childish faggot rappers got styleless
Denialists, fly it blind kid
Bleed from the soul when I insight the sliced rib
White kids and the niggas who keep em dancing
Thats all rap is, and you keep trying to make an anthem
I'm so random like my bro random
I go hard you go hammock, go fat boy make a sandwich
While we go bananas, and we cause damage
And the Cauze manage, what the fuck, I go hard while you go hammock
Now fat boy go make a sanwhich

[Outro]
You fucking rappers, sittin around
Eating sandwich's on a fucking hammock like Homer Simpson
In the fucking booth
Dumb high you faggot

Dont compare me to you nigga, you ain't this
