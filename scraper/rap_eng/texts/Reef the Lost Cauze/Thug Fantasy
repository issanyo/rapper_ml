[Intro]
You ever dream of having everything you ever wanted? All the money, all the bitches. Fly rides and ice, right? Haha yeah, that’s what we call a thug fantasy

[Hook]
Exotic beaches laid up on a canopy
Private planes, smoke the finest haze with my family
Keep a million stashed in the marble mantelpiece
Guns, butter, and bitches, thug fantasy
Exotic beaches laid up on a canopy
Private planes, smoke the finest haze with my family
Keep a million stashed in the marble mantelpiece
Guns, butter, and bitches, thug fantasy

[Verse One]
Mahogany minks, dining at the top of the Sphinx
Glasses clink as we gobble our drinks
Astounding chains with impossible links
Crystal shining with coke residue powder on the sink
In the den where I twist haze, lust to get paid
Roll with killers who been getting figures since the sixth grade
My whip game is impeccable, incredible
Fly through in this spaceship, extraterrestrial
We professionals, invest and hit moves
Sick coupe with the big shoes, nigga I’m a big dude
Make big moves, headlines are normal
My lawyer Rico beat the RICO, fed time and all
But no more bagging up white, I live the glamorous life
Bought a new crib for Mag and his wife
My whole fam eating cabbage and rice
Lobster tails with wine, I’ll have a glass of the white, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Blowing the hardest indo, all-black Ferrari Enzo
Can’t see my face behind the tints and thick smoke
Futuristic, Atari and Nintendo
Shorties lust the pimp stroke nigga cause I get dough
Break bread, party with my kinfolk
Penthouse hotel rental we keep it simple
Relax fitted, move at a boss tempo
The feds know info, we never let them know
No longer eating chicken wings and shrimp rolls
Personal chefs and trainers, the body is a temple
And all that jazz, dog we spent all that cash
Look at shortie dancing with all that ass
Toast to champagne yeah closing deals on the SkyPager
I made you, gators in nine flavours
Luciano shit, we getting mob paper
You know the saying, laugh now and cry later, what

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Hey yo I wrote this to show kids
That got it confused with show biz, it’s all hocus pocus
These rap niggas talking all this coke shit
But they don’t never tell you where the road ends, it’s viewed with a closed lens
Because of thug fantasy I’ve lost close friends
And I don’t think you understand when you quote them
So to quote Jada loosely, you wanna be like Tony Montana but you ain’t seen the whole movie
Them boys coming for you, either to lock you up
Or the kind that kick in the door ski masks gunning for you
I just wanna warn you, it’s easy to do songs like this but honestly I don’t wanna bore you
It’s okay to dream for riches in life
Money, cars, bitches are nice but it’s a ridiculous price
If you ain’t living it right, don’t be feeding into these rappers
Cause most of the time they just spitting the hype hype

[Hook]
