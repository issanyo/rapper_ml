[Verse]
Ayo real niggas, hood niggas, backpackers, bloggers
Hipster kids, stick up kids, golf slobs, rockers
Broke kids, po' kids, get money, ballers
All these motherfuckers been waitin' for our turn
Since West Philly fell off the streets been lackin'
West Philly never fell off I was asleep on Tasker
The Counterparts still here, we keepin' it classic
Like Coka-Cola, coke in boulders we keep in our mattress
Keep an ice pick, nice trick, sleeves in our jackets
Make you disappear do you believe in the magic?
Like I'm David Blaine, me and Mag' Raising Cain
Four fifth, razor blade, the realest shit orangutang
Clap for me, rap money
Coke heads, fat dummies
Swipe glass, white trash, yeah you a cast money
Who want a war from me?
Still spending tour money
Wild fans, house band, Alabama porch monkey
I wreck crews, man I'm so disrespectful
You'll never see me face to face like MF Doom
I'm gonna be this way the rest of my life
So fuck every blog, message board and hip hop web site
Cause when that computer crash
Only a few will last
Is this fuckin' rap, or a computer class?
I ain't a Twitter nigga
I'mma kill a nigga
This is classic rock, Led Zep', Leonard Skynard
You a herd, who switch listenin' to Fergalicious
I spit in a rapper face like I ain't never heard the nigga
Cause I probably haven't
Cauze is a rowdy savage
Spit like a thousand magnums
Blow like Saudi Arab
Bomb forts, I'm for any rhyme war
Since '94 I've been a fuckin' Creep like Thom Yorke
You guys are candy, you guys can't stand me
Cause I'm a pro in this game and you'se a Diaper Danny
(He's unstoppable baby!)
Shout out to Dicky V
I'm 63 and old homeboy, know your history
The legend, the myths, surrounded by infamous
I'm in-famous, you suck kid anus
Don't say shit to me
Special Delivery without Diddy dancin'
The game is cold, Tyson's crib is now 50's mansion
The mind frame of 50 Mansons
No Marilyn, I sling heroin to titty dancers
And coke sluts, I like when families are broke up
King and The Cauze comin' youngin', roll out or roll up
And it best be skunk like Pepe Le Pew
We don't fuck with bitch niggas dawg, especially you
