[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah -- 1, 2
Yo Ferrigno
1, 2 -- yeah

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
I ain't even think of swinging on you, that's a reflex
First one to test a mahfucker, that's a G check
Send this mahfucker back to God, he a defect
A celebrated martyr, I'm in Luxembourg with Liebknecht
I eat these (???) but hate bein' mad sluggish
How the sayin' go? Good riddance to bad rubbish
The ox all bloody, I stabbed him from frustration
The modern Thor rapper, I crack 'em like crustaceans
I was foul for a while, now I'm on some healthy shit
Still I'll aim this chopper at your head like it's a selfie stick
Riding on my enemies, I'm on my Makaveli shit
Master of the arts, I'm on my Sandro Botticelli shit
All of y'all is food to me, you nothing but a Scooby Snack
This mahfucker lost he need to get himself a Google map
Everything dirty money, even the soap
This a Beowulf infrared beam and a scope
Doma!

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze]
This is warfare, get your guns ready
This is warfare, hold your guns steady
This is life or death, yeah son deadly
A mother fuckin G 'til the sun melt me
This is warfare, get your guns ready
This is warfare, hold your guns steady
This is life or death, yeah son deadly
A mother fuckin G 'til the sun melt me

[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I'm a lion and the lion don't get left with the lambs
And you might get hit with bullets that was meant for your man's
It's no body cause the body under desolate sands
And I'm mean to money, money, I'ma press up the bands
This mahfucker think that he tough 'cause his man husky
He gettin' what's coming to him like he's Sandusky
The SP old and the records is mad dusty
It's a Mossberg 5 on the pump in the tan duffy
I was mad reckless, behavior was wild rowdy
So I just had to take that charge like I'm Kyle Lowry
I will snatch a dickhead chain and smile proudly
It's kings among the king's, possession and hail Crowley (hail Crowley)
This is where the shelterin' stops
'cause you never too old to take an L from your pops
This the throne of God homie, give the seraph his crown
And I'm bloodthirsty, it's a new sherrif in town
Yeah

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze]
This is warfare, get your guns ready
This is warfare, hold your guns steady
This is life or death, yeah son deadly
A mother fuckin G 'til the sun melt me
This is warfare, get your guns ready
This is warfare, hold your guns steady
This is life or death, yeah son deadly
A mother fuckin G 'til the sun melt me
