[Verse 1]

This is for the rum spillers and drug dealers
I ain't no J Dilla but I come from a slum village
Trying to survive out here you'd better come with it
Pain is pleasure, some get it, some give it
Yo the kids don't have socks or shoes
This is not a rap song, this is rock and blues
Watch the news, see the reporter telling tall tales
It's like a trap scene you destined to all fail
All hail the corner store testament
City of Philly no rest is meant for any residents
Cops arrest you without no evidence
Only way we getting rich is out-of-court settlements
That money move out your momma house, you in the basement
Can't afford to live in the hood, gentrification
This is a nation divided between the guys
Getting cream and the working poor who die on their knees
Yeah the have and have-nots
Taking lives and squeeze till the last drop
So we drink till the last shot
In a land of white judges and black cops
I only know one way out, this is my last shot

[Hook]

Take a look around, tell me what you see
Tell me what you would wanna do if you was me
I don't wanna live, don't really wanna die
They wanna clip my wings, I just wanna fly

So get me outta here, get get me outta here
Get me outta here, get get me outta here
I can't take the madness, won't take my life for granted
Or let them take advantage, I'd rather take my chances

[Verse 2]

But do you get me? How can you live in the city
With millions are still feel alone and empty
The walls have been painted with the blood of my loved ones
So every day I will not forget where I come from
I'm from the home of the brave, home of the slave
Where they recommend you invest stocks and graves
Stolen and locked away and we ain't had a win since motherfucking Dr. J
I've got a lot to say but not enough time
I wanna tell you the whole story, ain't got enough rhymes
Ain't got enough pain to share it all
The load's too heavy Lord my back can't bear it all
They don't care at all, isn't it obvious?
The world is run by crooks and gun-toting lobbyists
Officials who fail to deliver on promises
Pay to play the only way they ever acknowledge us
Kids can't afford colleges without scholarships
If you ain't climbing it you not a shit
Blue or white life is determined by what colour your collar is
I've reached the end of my rope, I have no more tolerance

[Hook]

Take a look around, tell me what you see
Tell me what you would wanna do if you was me
I don't wanna live, don't really wanna die
They wanna clip my wings, I just wanna fly

So get me outta here, get get me outta here
Get me outta here, get get me outta here
I can't take the madness, won't take my life for granted
Or let them take advantage, I'd rather take my chances
