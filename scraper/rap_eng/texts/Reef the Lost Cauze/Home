[Verse One]:
Hey ma, I know you happy that your kids are gone
At the same time, a little sad cause it's been so long
Since you didn't have one of us in the next room
I often worry sometimes because it's just you
But you got so much livin' to do
So much on your plate, I got a schedule to visit with you
Damn, I need to stop by and kick it with you
Just sit down and talk and listen to you
Eyes on the house
I painted a picture for June
Told him to stop by and check when I couldn't get through
I love you
For raising us the way that you did mom
I only hope I do the same for my kids mom
No matter where I is or where I live
I will be there in a minute if you in some shit
Or just need to talk or borrow some cash
Cause there was times you let me borrow your last
I'm so grateful
So thankful, hot meals on that oak table
Kept my plate full, I'm amazed you
Raised two kids, damn near alone
I praise you, so no matter where, I'm on my way to
I'll always be close to home from the cradle to the grave
I'd give my life away if it could save you
I just wanna say thank you
Thank you
I just wanna say thank you
Thank you

[Hook]:
And even though I'm off on my own ma
I'm never ever too far from home ma
If you need me you get on that phone ma
And I'll be on my way
Home, home
And even though I'm off on my own ma
I'm never ever too far from home ma
If you need me you get on that phone ma
And I'll be on my way
Home, home

[Verse Two]:
Baby sis you in college now, that's some crazy shit
I can hear you now like, "Brother when you gon' make it rich?"
You might get there first
Only God and mommy might beat me if I don't get there first
Just keep goin' for yours and don't stop at all
I'm so proud of you, at the same time, not shocked at all
You work hard, even if you dropped from ball
You got a family that loves you and will stop it all
To stop your fall, but I doubt you need it
You've been through so much girl I don't believe you can be defeated
So, live your life but don't do what they do
The world is yours, I can't wait to see where it takes you
Some people will hate you, let them hate
They want you to fall off, I say let them wait
Look, to thy own self, be true, you know what that means
If you need anything just get at me

[Hook]:
And even though I'm off on my own love
I'm never ever too far from home love
If you need me you get on that phone love
And I'll be on my way to take you
Home, home
And even though I'm off on my own love
I'm never ever too far from home love
If you need me you get on that phone love
And I'll be on my way to take you
Home, home
