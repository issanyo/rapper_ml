[Verse: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Like a college kid leaving his home
Like the words sung my Ms. Nina Simone
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new light
Throw on your shades J, the future too bright
We put in work, watch how we increase the stock
It's 5 G and that's soon to be my fee to rock
It's like the good music been sleeping underneath a rock
The flow is pure grind, but the beats is rock
Or the sneakers pop like Mike and Quincey
This is true art and I am DiVinci
Bust out any box that they try to fit me
I'll sing like a guy from the 50's or sign with 50
Whether thuggin' it or ruggedness
Tight tees and a bubble vest
Trust me homeboy, you ain't seen nothin' yet
It's a house party, trees and a couple Becks
Come on in we 'bout to set it in a couple secs
