Chorus 2x:

You can find me on the porch around noontime
Spittin' new rhymes, watch the day cruise by
My weed is a dream, you know the blue kind
Flow like Jameson the beat like moonshine

Verse 1:
Damn these dudes excitin'
Leave your head fucked up like Andrew Bynum
Ike Turner right wig, light cig, take a nice swig
Find me in the mud trying to fight pigs
Yeah, I'm an animal at best:
The spirit of an angel, the devil in the flesh
No pitchfork, a long tail just a hoody
And smoke from bong trails as a result of song sales
Mama I smoked the tv
When you reach the pearly gates you better hope to see me
Cause then you'll show shit's official
Been wild since PE get up or get down
And welcome to the Terrordome
Niggas pray for pennies I ain't talking a pair of phones
Break it down to the barest bones
And these rappers jackin' my lines like we share a fuckin' phone

Chorus 2x:

Verse 2:
This that front porch flow, fuck a condo
Ill with the assists on Rajon, no Rondo
London Guns, blacker than the Congo
The Cauze'll knock a horse on its back like Mongo
Where all the white women?
And why do rappers now all act like women?
You got the skirt-wearin' hipster douche
The Cauze is like jaws son, you're gonna need a bigger booth
A bigger boat, my trigger smokes
I done killed so many rappers that I've had to learn to live with ghosts
Like Ebenezer. I don't follow the leader
I'm the type to take the lead and tell that nigga to keep up
Light the weed up, jeepin for the ear-wax
Create beautiful indie art, like Miramax
You hearin' that? My mind placed where your ears is at
Place the greats and never fuckin' fear the wacks

Chorus 2x:
