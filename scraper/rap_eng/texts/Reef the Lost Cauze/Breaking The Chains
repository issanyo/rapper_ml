[Hook]:
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains

[Verse One]:
I ain't never felt freer
I doubted my God but he made me a believer
But he ain't put me through Hell, he put me somewhere deeper
A river of shit somehow came out cleaner
You can see it when you gaze my demeanor
Born not to follow I was made from leaders
Cut from a cloth that's been burned and banished
So I'm in the cotton fields till the seeds are replanted
And I'mma sew a new cloth that expands the planet
Pieces of a canvas filled from my point of vantage
Been overlooked, misled and mismanaged
Been left for dead, so called friends up and vanished
Things went wrong I gave myself to blame
Truly a lost cause gave myself the name
But just like mighty Kong and them runaway slaves
I freed myself from the bullshit, I'm breaking the chain

[Hook] [Sample of 'Don't Move' by Phantogram]:
I'm not your nervous feeling
Each time we say goodnight
You picture buildings burning to the ground
From a basement in the streetlight
(I'm breaking the chains)
I'm not your drinking problem
A hole is in the sky
(I'm breaking the chains)
It's not your heart that you've been thinking of
Just the feeling like you're gonna die

[Reef]
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains

[Verse Two]
I ain't never felt freer
I doubted my God but he made me a believer
But he ain't put me through Hell, he put me somewhere deeper
A river of shit somehow came out cleaner
Like Andy Dufresne
My arms to the sky as I stand in the rain
The chains placed around my art
Is like puttin' a cage around my heart
It gets dark
There's no spark, there's no thought, there's no lyrics
There's no hook, there's no arc
No bridge for me to come across
Cause I'm afraid if I switch it up, it won't come across
Well that's your loss
If you need me to be
Somebody I was seven years ago, that's weak
No matter what I do or say, yo that's Reef
I'll still rock your jaw, don't get fooled by the feet
I'm free

[Singing}
I'm not your fortune teller
(I'm breaking the chain)
I'm not your spinning head
(I'm breaking the chain)
I'll never make you uncomfortable too
This is starting to fuck with my head

[Verse Three]:
Respect the growth and know that MCing is a respected oath
In which I can only be described as dope
I won't be binded by any chains or ropes
I'm reachin' my full scope it's not a fuckin' joke
Trust me
I take it very seriously within this industry
So take whatever misconceptions
Or what directions you think I'm gonna go next in
Cause you can't plan the path of aggression

[Hook]:
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains
I'm breaking the chains
I'mma do me, y'all can sit and complain
Cause all I got in this world is my balls and my word
My family and my name
I'm breaking the chains {X16}

[Singing]:
All you know how to do is shake shake
Keep your body still
Keep your body still
All you do is shake shake shake
Keep your body still
Keep your body still
