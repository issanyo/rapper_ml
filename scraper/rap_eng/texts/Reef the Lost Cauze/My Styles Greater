"My styles greater" - Nas

[Verse]
Yeah smoke a glassy bowl
On a grassy knoll
[?} we make classics like it's Abby Road
I'm the baddest though
I'll be gladly known as a nasty foe
Till I'm getting paid like daddy Knowles
Word to Solange, I'm Pompeii
Need Three Stacks like Andre, rap is beyond gay
I bring the massive [?] back
It's that 'He Appear Physically Then Evaporate Into Energy' rap
Keep the town wet
With spit that ain't reach the ground yet
Stages grew legs and ran in fear of my sound check
Disgusting like a hounds breath after he found flesh
Blood spewed from pews where I'm found dressed
In the sharpest threads, I'm off my meds
And you marked for dead
How you wear dicks across your head?
Wearing your cousin's skirt
You a fuckin' jerk
Get your mother murked
Like Jesus Shuttelsworth
Swish
Kids be stupefied by this music high that I do with Raj
Yo queue the Nas
"My styles greater"
Kill silently like Jewish mobs
Who am I?
I'm Lost Cauze and "my styles greater"

Oh we stop now, let me rock now
Straight off the top now
The potency to out smoke MC's
Leave 'em all holy like the rosary
Yeah you know it's me
Hosery around my face so you don't know it's me
The game was taught rather than told to me
By old O.G.'s with scars on they hand
In the back of the bar playing Cauze with gods in they hand yeah
I inhale the wisdom and move back a [?] of locust
I'm focused
And stay well lit like [?]
My [?] the pain that invokes mix
Of emotions
Of the atrocities of the atrocious
I'm now open for business
The kids is often hopeless
The wilting of black roses
I'm a wizard who remains cloaked it's
I'm the dopest
Yo, I am Reef
The man the myth, the time of the beast
Dumhi frying beats, slam like Iron Sheik
Make the ground rock
In the DJ Booth where my sound knock
Lost Cauze, I'm going to go eat now
And down pot
I think that's two minutes
Y'all got more than enough
Plus most of these freestyles be boring as fuck
I'm gone
