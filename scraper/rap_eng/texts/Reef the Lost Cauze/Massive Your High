[Intro]
Scooty-hoooo!
Uh, high as a mofucker
And we high as a mofucker!
Yeah, Amsterdam whaddup
Yeah Yeah

[Verse 1]
Im feelin' sacrilegious, just smoked a pack of Swishers
So strong feel like Pac Man hit ya
Pac Man picture, chomp in the ghost
Fresh dressin on white and we all on a boat
Live life now, cause we all gonna croak
And in case this ship sink I'll use your corpse as a float
And of course as a joke but, somewhat truthful
Im the OG gettin' love from the new school
You too cool? Oh you 'dem cool cats
Trying to judge young, but your too old and too fat
You the worst type of human, true doucheness
You Pretty Ricky, im Rick Kubrick
Peep the beard though, some type of weirdo
Somehow managed to live off rap for ten years though
Where'd my beer go? Oh thats right I drank the shit
I wanna win a Grammy just so I can fucking thank a bitch

[Hook]
(Its easy, dont play me girl)
Walk straight kid, massive your high!
(Its easy, dont play me girl)
Walk straight kid, massive your high!
(Its easy, dont play me girl)
Walk straight kid, massive your high!
Massive your high!
Trippy, trippy
This is trippy, trippy
You feel trippy, trippy

[Verse 2]
Yo you claim that you claim that you half as nice
You gave bad advice, that is like
Saying you like The Pips more than Gladys Knight
I came back from the afterlife
To tell you that God said, negro pass the mic
I'm hood hot meets Woodstock
J5's never scratched like Joe Jacks was a good pop
I don't exist like a good cop
You frontin' like you will, when we all know you will not
Im a real cop, pause that like a still shot
Shoot the one holdin' my son, Im a ill pop
Dolly my baby, Molly my baby, I will pop
Oh yes I'm the kings weapon, holdin' a kings session
I dont king sessin, Im a king not a ?
Its one thing to question, another to answer
The ? of my error, I'm God's hammer

[Hook]

[Outro]
Its gettin' trippy man
Trippy, trippy
Trippy, trippy
