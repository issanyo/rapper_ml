May God have mercy on your soul

[Verse One]:
I say a prayer, I hold my son
Put on my jacket, and load my gun
It seems trouble came to town
And it's looking for me so I'mma show his ass around
Show him the sound, the screams of Hell's hounds
Waitin'
At the gate for him to come down
Years before we met in the ring
And now he's returned to bring death to the king?
He thought I'd run, he thought I'd whimper
This fuckin' shotgun on my lap begs to differ
The hunt is on, you smellin' like dinner
The good Lord said, "Spare no blood from the sinner"
He's holed up in some Comfort Inn
A junkie's den with a crew of his flunky friends
My crew pulls up then the hunt begins
I'mma put some shit hotter than the sun in him

[Chorus]:
Like a shotgun
Needs an outcome
I'm gon' pop at you
You gon' get some
Like a shotgun
Needs an outcome
I'm gon' pop at you
You gon' get some

[Reef talking]:
The Grim Reapers are knockin' boy. Answer the door

[Verse Two]:
The deed is done, the damage is evident
I'm on my way with my goons to your residence
Big guns that sounds like elephants
? that sound like evidence
It sounds like admissions
So I let a round off like division
I've made the decision
The judge and the jury, you facin' conviction
Dawg, I'm a man of conviction
You beggin' for your life and it don't sound convincin'
I'm rockin' all black boots
And a car full of killers in all black suits
Reservoir Dogs, I'm Mr. White
Yeah, Harvey Keitel, don't fuck with your life
Before the dawn comes, drawin' guns
I'mma take his ass out 'fore the songs done

[Chorus]:
Like a shotgun
Can't be outdone
I'm gon' pop at you
You gon' get some
Like a shotgun
Needs an outcome
I'm gon' pop at you
You gon' get some
