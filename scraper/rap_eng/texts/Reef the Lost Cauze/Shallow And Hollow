"They try to follow but they shallow and hollow" - The Pharcyde 'Drop'

[Verse]:
Yo, you run your lips get popped in the mouth
You motherfuckers are garbage, Oscar The Grouch
Eat my dust bunnies
You should hush money
Before I rob you then extort you for hush money
You a wild idiot, a real tough dummy
I'm a surgeon, swig bourbon before I cut tummies
What you want from me?
Talk is cheap
You wanna book me in Boston? Talk to Leedz
Talk to Matty Trump
I keep a bitch with a fatty hump
Call me "Daddy" chump before the gatty dump
My beats you badly pump, made by Falside
I'm outside of your crib, drawin' the outline
Rawhide, like beef jerky
I work late and sleep early
I eat words B and you'll be
Another MC sayin' "Revert me"
Since 13 I've been unearthly
My God
