[Verse 1]

From the backstreets of Philly to the world abroad
I know you heard the call of the hardest bars
Spit raw, split jaws over pitfalls, get gone, it’s Lost
Young grimy most likely to dry heave on anyone who despise me
That’s why Reef keep these mics right beside me
Cauze otherwise motherfuckers die
Other guys try to rhyme, none come close
I smoke your mind then I focus mine, leave you holding my balls
My dick is like a shark’s fin
Shit ripped apart when I start stomping
Like this was a mosh pit I am top dog
You are not shit, you know who get this locked bitch
Glock spit, leave you in the hospice
Shot and shocked and scarred
I told them brothers run up, bodyslam like Hogan brother
Who let’s go nigga, it’s no holds barred
Michael Vicking these dudes, you move, you lose
I swear I’m there if you prepare for none, spared the the whole nine yards
And if that’s not enough my rap game is tough
And I ain’t twenty-one yet, are you having fun yet?
Oh my God

[Verse 2]

Gun clap, I come at, niggas where your blunts at?
Nigga pass me that, puff that, don’t make me raise my voice
And get my boys to chicka chicka blow
Word on the street was you’d eat Reef
Fuck, what you putting in your reefer?
You’s a dreamer, please get your head out the clouds
I’m too raw for you, too hardcore
The Lord himself will strike you
For testing his disciple, bitch bow down
On one knee, palms raised to the Heavens
I was raised to raise weapons and blaze in your direction
So how you like me now? Kool Moe Dee shit
You know me kid, too ? seeming
Soap in sock and beating you like homie the clown
Bobo or Krusty, your flow’s rusty
The boy is husky, young and high-strung
And when I bug a track slow down

[Verse 3]

As I ram I knock you off any block you stand on
If you think you can handle the Cauze you damn wrong
You’re about as improtant to the game as Keith Van Horn
On and I’m hands on all around the world it’s the same song
Trying to get my name strong
Bounce niggas back and forth like ping pong
Forrest Gumping these niggas, gun dumping on a nigga
Now you running like a lizard, I slither right across your face
I ate this kid like a baby back rib
When I make em flip like gymnastics
I be on the bad shit when I’m smashing you niggas
Want action? Give me a call
If you really that hard, if you really that raw
Then hand me a bra with these hands and these claws
When your upping comes I’m the nigga you’ll get nothing from
Number one, uno, dos, and tres
Smoke a eight of grape and when the fumes escape
Then doomed your fate, niggas ain’t ready man

[Verse 4]

Who debating the way I demonstrate?
How I penetrate mics till they menstruate
Break your bones so they won’t bend straight, fuck it
Beat you with your crutches, puff dutches
Twist more trees than tornadoes, leave you red as tomatoes
Or tomahtoes, my motto is that tomorrow is near
I’m here in the now, you hearing the sound
Of a million demons screaming, Reef bitch it’s no secret
Who’s the kingpin with these ink pens
What you niggas thinking? Now the beat’s sinking
