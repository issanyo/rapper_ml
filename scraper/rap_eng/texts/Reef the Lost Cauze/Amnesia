[Sample]:
"Time to recall all the things I couldn't think of yesterday"

[Verse One]:
Out of my own image, I made you from it
Straight out the cradle dawg, I raised you from it
Your life suck, I saved you from it
You got fat off of all the food that I gave your stomach
You had beef, I'm hoppin' in the ride with you
They shoot you, they shoot me, I prolly would've died with you
I ain't had five, I still got high with you
But now a line's been drawn I can't side with you
We were like two brothers, but you mother
Fucker, discovered your true colors
I had to turn my back on you
Now in the street I can't turn my back on you
You might have the mac on you
Whatever you needed, I would've given that to you
But now when I see you, I think about clappin' you
Real recognize real I can't rap to you
I can't pretend no more it's not natural

[Chorus]:
All the things that I did for, you must've forgot
I went out on a limb for, you must've forgot
Damn, man almost got killed for you, you must've forgot
The tables have turned, the bridges have burned
All the things that I did for, you must've forgot
I went out on a limb for, you must've forgot
Damn, man almost got killed for you, you must've forgot
Now the tables have turned, the bridges have burned

[Verse Two]:
You used to say I wouldn't be shit
But things done changed and now oh, you ain't really mean it
That tune was wack, you ain't like that beat right?
Now every weeknight you sendin' me an e-vite
A Myspace comment
And now spittin' on my dick so hard you damn near vomitin'
Critics listen, damn near silenced them
Lyrics listen, damn near astonishin'
And you caught on late
I got the footage in my brain homie, you caught on tape
I knew everything you thought before you swore I was great
Now everything you say you look like more of a fake
Call yourself tryin' to build with me, collab and shit
That's cool motherfucker but I need cash to spit
If you were true from day one I wouldn't ask for shit
But now for you, all I got is my black ass to kiss
Motherfucker

[Chorus]:
All the things that I did for, you must've forgot
I went out on a limb for, you must've forgot
Damn, man almost got killed for you, you must've forgot
Now the tables have turned, the bridges have burned
All the things that I did for, you must've forgot
I went out on a limb for, you must've forgot
Damn, man almost got killed for you, you must've forgot
Now the tables have turned, the bridges have burned

[Verse Three]:
You out here wilin', livin' your life without respect
You must've forgot about the struggle of Malcolm X
Or Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther and all the rest
The marches you let the dogs tear apart they flesh
They caged us, enslaved us, raped us
Played us, made us hate us, when you gon' wake up?
It wasn't so long ago that you'd get lynched for thinkin'
Water fountains marked 'white' you get killed for drinkin'
The way you carry yourself
Don't you know when you kill your community you bury yourself?
I'm not preachin' it just pisses me off
When a man stand up for his people you'll say that he's soft
If he kills one of your own, you'll feel that he's strong
There ain't a person alive who couldn't tell me that's wrong
The kids future...we ruined it for 'em
The white man ain't got to kill us brother, we doin' it for 'em
And that's real

[Chorus]:
The middle passage when we were enslaved, you must've forgot
In our faces fire hose were sprayed, you must've forgot
You the reason we turnin' in our graves, you must've forgot
Can't you remember us, can't you remember us?
The middle passage when we were enslaved, you must've forgot
In our faces fire hose were sprayed, you must've forgot
You the reason we turnin' in our graves, you must've forgot
Can't you remember us, can't you remember us?
