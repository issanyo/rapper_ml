(Intro) Reef
Yeah, Lost Cauze, Doap Dixon
Uh, the Army in here
Salute me, yeah

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Uh, fuck with my brother Doap and I'mma cut his throat
We definition representin', what is Doap?
What is hope when ya faith get tested?
Yeah, what is coke when the weight ain't stretchin'?
Yeah, what is hate when the hatin' ain't affectin'?
A buncha mad niggas we comin' for mad figgaz
That upset money, that coke and wet money
That Frank Lucas buried under the steps money
It's official like a ref with a whistle
I'm from where young boys can't read but they rep wit their pistols
Yeah, respect is an issue but never with mines
Y'all funkies get away the shit but never with crimes
Stay knocked like a pregnant jawn
Im fittin' ta wreck this jaunt
Flatten ya face use it to eat my breakfast on
Your lyrics is wack they disrespect the song
Crush kill everyone, that's why my techs is long

(Hook) Samples scratching 2x
"The waitin's over" - Jadakiss
"Tell these motherfuckers" - Scarface
"Here come his crazy soldier" - Nas
"Takin' ova" - Jadakiss
"I don't stop squeezing till ya face is over" - Jadakiss

[Doap Nixon]
Yeah, I'm on their heels Reef, yo, let's go

Yo, y'all niggas is average learnin' to crawl
Producers is mad ass, we don't return ya calls
Ya emails get deleted so beat it
Ya helps is not needed, Knowledge itself completes it
Divine cipher power slid in this game nice
Signed a deal burnt my advance on the same night
(Let's go) This game so foul, so many cats
So many petty labels, so many traps
Ya moms shoulda put you in a school wit clean clothes
Dudes ova here hit gold wit mean flows
I'm in a ill Reef stay on the road
The Pharaohs doing shows, I got that year on the stove
(Let's go) My whole life felt like I'm stuck at a stop light
But seein' how the hustlers got that money to wash right
Me and Reef came from the nights we slang white
To spittin' out Bangkok, rippin' the same mic

(Hook) Samples scratching 2x

[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, ain't nobody fuckin' wit the .38 on my waist
And when that bulldog bark it'll lay you to waste
I ain't fuckin' around wit ya, y'all need to stay in ya place
And the vest ain't gonna help you God I aim at the face
Y'all ain't doin' shit original fam
And my gun is the same color as The Original Man
I caught a body and I put the shit to digital cam
That shit you makin' ain't a hit it's just a pitiful jam
Yeah, ayo Doap cousin hit 'em wit the .40 Glock
Make his body levitate and he can do a dome wit 'Pac
Y'all motherfuckers should just take this as a warnin' shot
I'm bout to celebrate, I heard about the fallin' cop
Y'all think y'all could fuck wit Paz yet it's not hardly
I put your name in the obituary - John Tardy
My whole cipher should be dreaded like we Bob Marley
And it ain't another human that's Master Fard Godly

(Outro) Vinnie
Brrrrrrrrttt.... fuckin' cock sucka --- AOTP
Sour Diesel, what the fuckin' deal niggas
