[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
KGR, never [?] but live though
You guys know I'm a [?] in the sideshow
Slide polar fly ho
Paparazzi lights on him, lookin' like the five-o
Put it down, believe me
[?]
Live as a bull [?] power of [?]
[?] down to the grain
[?] wait like I'm [?] trigger [?] with a four pound on the [?]
And you rain when the bread appear
You know I'm getting cheddar here
Left to throw it up and make a bitch feel like Fred Astaire
Bo Jack' Nike with both wrists icy
Platinum on a black [?] on a white tee
[?] with double action Rugers
A real pimp mack on a bad bitch with moolah
Beaches of Aruba, quick style in the cooler
Cigar from Cuba, [?]
Leave you hangin' like Omar Suarez you loser
I've been movin' with a muthafuckin' [?] remover, huh
Corona, Queens be the turf I claim
Got my hands covered in dirt [?], nigga what

[Verse 2: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Any nigga front, best believe the clip will dump
Left him sittin' slump on 5th and Shrunk in a Lincoln trunk
Lift a pump like a gas attendant, blast your children
All we after in this game of life is cash and pendents
Diamond encrusted, yellow rubies look like ice and mustard
Pussies get their hymens busted if they ever try and fuck with
The embodiment of highly sick
Kung fu niggas wanna karate kick and end up shot to shit
Coppin' bricks you ain't never did
Never lived in the slums, Feds run into your residence
Never sit with your back turned feel the gat spurn in your sternum
We earnin' nigga, where ever crack burn
Dim lit alley, flip 10,000
Rob all your cash houses and then hit Cali
Yo my man in Fresno pull strings like Geppetto
Kool G and Cauze rockin' the ghetto like heavy metal motherfucker

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Lost Cauze, Rugged Man, truly we rebels
Me and my crew, we hard rocks, you and your boys is Fruity Pebbles
Thinkin' you nicer, you must be smokin' like Marion Berry
And his crow bar carryin', barbarian, married to the mic
Mass murderin' like Dirty Harry and I'll cut you out like Caesarian
Went independent at the time of Pataki and Giuliani
And I'll bury you back in the backyard I'm that hard
You lack God, makin' soap bars out of you like pig fat lard
I've been savaging emcees since I was a fat kid on the playground
Wearin' the tough skin jeans with the fuckin' patches in the knees
I've been sittin' in the room watchin' porn with sick thoughts
Thinkin' I was born with sportin' horns and pitch forks
Piss poor packin' a pistol I'm pissed off
Thinkin' I'm soft, you got it backwards like the pants on Kris Kross
Trendy hipster rappin' mall rats
I'm in the big league you playin' hardball with wiffle ball bats
Amazin' when I'm rhymin', you cake you plagiarizing you fake
It's a blatant disguise and labels got you slavin' like Miss Daisy Drivin'
And any time the beat breaks I eat snakes like cheese cakes
The Kool genius, Reef, Rugged, one track three greats
