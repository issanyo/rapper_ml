Feel the shottie blast
Put him in a body cast
Don't listen to rappers, listen to Johnny Cash
This is murder, death, kill, nigga body bag
I'm trying to see 100 grand like a college tab
I dropped out of college, never paid college back
I'm a fuckin' animal and I acknowledge that
You just swallow sacks
Hit me on Twitter begging for a follow back
Lil' nigga holla back
You gon' kill a nigga, this should be the soundtrack
Just don't say the nigga part if you around blacks
To all my Euro trash
Whores on Tinsle Ave
I roll the finest grass, exhale and begin to laugh
Thinking of all the dead bodies left in my path
Thinking of all the dumb bitches left in my past
Thinking of all the dumb shit I could buy with this cash
Thinking of all the rap niggas who didn't last
Tortoise and hare flow
So rare though, black birds on my fuckin' shoulder like a scarecrow
Pharaoh
Folding them like wash clothing
Kick a fuckin' puppy to this
Overdose of Doberman
Nobody cold as him
Your man's still trying to rap?
No one is as old as him
He opened up for Jesus, Moses, and Job and 'em
I told to them
I'd come back for the souls of them
There's no hope for them
Snowgoons, Lost Cauze, here we go again
I hope they fuckin' accept it
And it took us just a week to bust out of this record
So respect it or end up naked
On the exit
Of a highway, I Did It My Way like Sinatra
(I'm your father)
This is motherfuckin' mobster
(Who's liver?)
Godfather
Gobstopper, you're sweet as candy
I'll pop ya!
