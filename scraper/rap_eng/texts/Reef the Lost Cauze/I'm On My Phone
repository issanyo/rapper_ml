[Intro]
I'm nothing without you. You are my world. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night...just to hold you. Your glow, brightens my day. I can't live without my phone!

[Hook]
"My world is empty without you babe"
Text me, text me, text me
"My world is empty without you babe"
I can't live without my phone
"My world is empty without you babe"
You are everything to me
"My world is empty without you babe"

[Verse 1]
I'm on my phone
All the goddamn time
I'm on my phone right now writing this goddamn rhyme
People talking in my ear, but I never hear 'em speaking
I'm too busy checking GMail, taking pics and Tweeting
Fuck the outside world, this is my life
I just put up a new Facebook post, I'm waiting for likes
Give me a thumbs up, yo please leave a comment
I'm on my phone so much all my people wanna vomit
I'm texting, flexing, erasing all the spam and
Just took a pic of my dinner, 'bout to Instagram it
Billions of people on this planet
And our cell phone took our brains and reprogrammed it
Now a days it's hard for me to actually talk
And I can't believe when people use they phone to call
Straight to voicemail
Yo, no disrespect
But bitch I'm on my phone, next time just send a text
I'm on my phone!

[Hook]
"My world is empty without you babe"
I can't live without my phone
"My world is empty without you babe"
Text me, text me, text me
"My world is empty without you babe"
Yo, yo, yo, yo I'm on my phone
"My world is empty without you babe"
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm on my phone, no time to converse with friends
Unless they wanna play a game of Words With Friends
Angry nerds playing Angry Birds
Bitches tweeting that they hate they man, now that's an angry bird
The internet has made it so that there is nothing sacred
From death to love making it's all status updated
It's just like high school and this is the lunch room
Still trying to impress dudes and get the girl to fuck you
Nothing has changed, now we do it without worry
Cause instead of human beings, we now talk to Suri
I can't tell you what Congress passed as a law
But I can tell you what Complex posted on their blog
Or what shoes Hype B said rock in the fall
My phone is just as addicting as drugs or alcohol
But it might be worse in actuality guys
Cause I probably kill someone if my battery died
I'm on my phone!

[Hook]
"My world is empty without you babe"
Yo, yo I can't live without my phone
"My world is empty without you babe"
Text me, text me, text me
"My world is empty without you babe"
Yo, yo I can't live without my phone
"My world is empty without you babe"
Yeah

[Outro]
This song is dedicated to the love my life. My baby. You fit so perfectly in my palm, in my hand and in my heart.There will never be a day that we will be apart. Every morning, I just wake up, wanting to know what you have to tell me. What photos were posted. Aw man, look at the Tweetagram. Haha yeah I agree with that. Aw, I'ma retweet this. Yeah. Hey girl, you look good. Let me like your photo. I'll never talk to you in real life but I'm just gonna be a creep and look at all your pictures. If that's okay with you. It's better that way. I'm not very good at social interaction. Except when I'm on my phone!

"My world is empty without you babe" {x6}
