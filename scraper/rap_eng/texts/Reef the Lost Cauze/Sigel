[Verse 1: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I'ma teach these weasels how to rhyme
Grimy Philly shit, Bean' Sigel in '99
Come correct, show respect and catch a throat shot
That shit won't sell, you won't make it to the boat dock
You fuck around and get cold clocked
What is the key to success matter when dealing with a broke lock?
Don't speak when you know not
I'm on the road to riches but for some reason the road block
That's why I sold rocks, I got mad proof
People with the glass roof the first one to throw rocks
Watch it shatter your brains, watch is splatter
Ain't shit changed, I'm the same just a little fatter
Don't give a fuck about my stomach widening
Guys want it but then I come to them and they get to run and hiding
Caged in cars, ducking and screaming
It's the A.O.T.P., don't give a fuck who your team is
Believe it

[Hook: Reef The Lost Cauze] {x2}
You niggas acting like you will but we know you won't
What's worse, the devil you know or the one you don't?
I say "nevaeh" I make you believer
I don't do a lot of talking I speak with the heater
The heater

[Verse 2: King Syze]
We the mic brasher
Spitting hypnotical gasses
Diabolical madness, astronomical hammers
Wordplay's bananas
The mic is God help me
I rock on a stone stage all over Philadelphi'
Y'all pathetic, taking selfies with your sorry
The only place you rock is the corner store deli
And I ain't mad at you
On the real it's laughable
We shine too bright, no light can contract in you
Here's a fair warning and y'all better behave
What I write on the page is my life on the stage
And I'm here to stay on the real
I ain't never leaving
Long as I'm living and breathing, I'ma be a spitting heathen
I'm getting even when I'm playing the odds
When I'm creating these bars, more like breaking the law
Catch a contact every time we lighting a verse
Wanna fuck with Reef? Better be ready to fight me first

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Ayo, beef don't hype it
Get beat with night sticks
I Rock The Casbah, Sharif don't like it
Feet, don't wipe it
On my welcome mat
Find me posted, getting roasted where the l's is at
I heard your album my nigga, what the hell is that?
When I was done listening, felt like I went to Hell and back
I'm the past, the present, the future
I'll fuck up every nigga in here, I'm Riley Cooper

[King Syze]
This is pure hip hop made with organic ingredients
What you spit is meaningless, niggas is not feeling it
Us on the other hand, we stay at it
We in our own league, we the reason in the bracket
Y'all just N.I.T., can't play with big dogs
We fighting but lock jaw, we ready to rock y'all
The top's spot gone ain't no getting it back
We Vanderbilt company, we owning these tracks
It's like...

[Hook]
