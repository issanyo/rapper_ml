[Intro]
What will be a father's legacy to his child?
Some'll leave money, some'll leave they name
But I have something much more special that I'd like to give to you

[Verse 1]
To my son Isiah, I write this with tears in my eyes
Just some things I wanna say in case I meet my demise
You are everything a father could ask for in a child
The world stopped for me every time I seen your smile
Your laughter like a chapter in my book of life
I hope the things I'm 'bout to tell you help you with the way you look at life
First of all, the streets is no place for you
Stay awake, stay aware and never be ( ? )
Racism's real, people will have hate for you
And make a face at you cause you're mixed with a race or two
But that's their problem and not yours
Go after good choir girls and not whores
Be grateful, remember that you got more
Than most kids, keep your mouth shut if you not sure
But if you are, then don't you dare cower
Speak your mind, share your power cause papa didn't' raise cowards

[Hook]
God forbid but in case I don't make it with you
It's a thousand lessons in life waiting for you
Listen to the songs, my son, I made 'em for you
A hundred rhyme books sitting in the basement for you

It's me and you forever
Even when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
I know it seems confusing but son, trust this
The cops are corrupted and not to be trusted
School is important, get your degree and all
But it's also important to be young and free and see it all
Brazilian beaches and London cathedral halls
Camp out in the desert underneath the stars
I want your views to be worldly
I want you to leave a legacy, a path, a vivid story
In order to do that, expand your horizon
Fuck other people, it's not their life to be decided
Love is hard, son, sometimes it's all a game
But you'll chase it forever cause the heart is kinda strange
And as far as religion, to me it's all the same
God is God no matter what you call his name
If you're not sure what I'd do, let daddy's music guide you
I'll always be right beside you
