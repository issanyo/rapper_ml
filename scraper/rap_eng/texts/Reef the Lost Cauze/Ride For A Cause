[Intro: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Yeah
Reef The Lost Cauze
DC the MIDI Alien
*Waddup*
Drop some science on y'all real quick
Check it
Here we go, uh!

*Bring the power back to the street*

[Verse 1: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Yo, the government watching all of those who [?] in it
They wanna lock us up cause their kids are loving it
Any [?], it's hard to keep hope
When down in New Orleans they wouldn't even send speedboats
Since the days are deep though they've been deceitful
If you're a Fed then no, we don't believe you
No place on my vicinity Catholic Church conspiracies
Misery disguised as ministries
I'm down at [?] embassy, cause they flip to see
All my brothers locked down and in penitentiaries
[?], I race with ya, fuck these redneck cops who brace Hitler yo
I spray triggers
At the politics, who polly with the gunlobbyers
Who put the dollars up to make sure we got enough
To take down the last of us
But now we rising up, revolution chump, ain't no stopping us

[Verse 2: Doap Nixon]
Yo, kamikaze everybody's corrupted
Motherfuckers do anything for a buck quick
That's great, so many sanitors shady
People in high places thinking they gon' play me (uh)
But we ain't the normal bend-over
We the type of [?] niggas just to get over
If it means clapping at a few Republicans
It ain't hard for Nix to get in touch with them
Pay a hooker to try to plant drugs on them
Feds got a nigga whole crib filled with [?] (that's crazy)
Burn my city to [?] (uh)
All the judges supreme court gon' remember me (uhuh)
Fly [?] a few country's embassies
Responsibility: Doap Nixon, DC (real nigga)
That's how you ride for a cause, you gotta make a few people have to ride with the lord, murder

[Hook x2: several samples overlap]
There's nothing in our way they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
I guess you know, you guess I'm just a radical
And all my comrades is ready, bring the power back to the street

[Verse 3: Blacastan]
Please beware of the media the truth's never told
Inside the main [?] Bohemian Grove
Bizarre rituals where leaders burn fetus
In front of 30-foot owls, to deplete us
This is real they can see you through the eye on a bill
Now the hood fucked up, where brothers trying pills
Your favorite rappers throwing diamonds up
Word to mother take a look at that Dynasty cover
It's far too perverse to discuss in a verse
Now the New World Order to control the universe
And guess who's down, you wouldn't [?]
Our new president you puppets elect
And while you slanging that poison to purchase a Lex
Our world is a mess please protect your neck
I know how to conserve with that [?] and bread
I don't need my money reserved by the fucking feds

[Reks]
Riot and radical, picking [?] booth
No truth in Bush victory's no proof
Whole youth inspired [?] hope, oh what a joke
Obama or not, still on the block, we still broke
Claiming in fact, a Patriot Act, is constitutional
I'm refusing your blindfold, bamboozle in using the rules of [?]
Members of Congress to prey on us
Citizens who giving in with Satan are pawners
Europian Union join up, forces with superpowers
True to [?] dollar sign devour
What is rightfully ours, [?] increasing bonuses
Police police our right to assembly  solidly holding us
Coaching us to dummy up, free speech is old as dust
This is why the hood say "in guns we trust"
They believe in, God giving bizarre priviledge
I pray you sit in that chair, catching long [?]

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Blacastan]
Word up, yeah
Blacastan shit
Urban embassy
DC, East Coast Avengers
It's time for political awareness
Ya niggas better get with this shit
The NWO is coming
The fuck you wanna do?
Straight up
Grab your guns man, protect your family
[?]
Or whatever
Get with it motherfuckers
