[Verse 1: King Syze]
Fuck being humble I'ma put it to you plainly
A.O.T.P. the best, that's how I feel lately
This ain't even rap this is jungle terminology
I end your existence and whoever try to ride on me
I turn your rhyming game to the Crying Game
Y'all [?] made you lost, couldn't hang on my lion's mane
Beards in the building, Philly rap forever
Type of hip hop that leave you cracked and severed
Ever hear the sound of a predator stalking it?
I talk the talk man but now a days I'm walking it
So simple, can't it be
Lyrics outlandishly
I'm staying hotter than the Amazon canopy
Take a look around, same team, same squad
With insane bars, don't quit your day job, okay pa?
It's just a warning man, take my advice
When it comes to my fam, I'll put your head in a vice
Fucker

[Verse 2: Reef The Lost Cauze]
This sound like Noreaga in '98
The stories that I create through hunger or simple taste
I can speak to anyone until they get it straight
My name hold weight that's money in the bank
I got the finest piff rolled in a Monte Cristo
My body's a temple, pussy, Patron and pistols
Sell crystals to get rich yo
Avoid the Feds and these snitch, bitch bro's yo
That was the plan, till I saw the light
That came from live niggas becoming falling life
I put it all on mic where I was saved at
Keep it moving, don't even listen to playback
A fraud, y'all been playing that roll since way back
My voice was mastered off the ADAT
We don't play that, show up where your place at
ASAP in all black hats like A-Trak
And let you taste bats
Nigga face fact
It's Eso, Syze and Reef, they can't hate that

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse 3: Esoteric]
A.O.T.P. the only way to start a rhyme
Those letters make your heart pump double time
Gutter lines, don't egg him on he's a G guy
Megatron verses Lebanon Levi
I'm a weapon on de-fi, stepping on knee high
[?] and reply they bodied by the sea side
Fuck your temp dates
I crush tenth place
My raps don't fit on ten plates they bend straight
You can't afford bars from me cause your rents late
I'm like Rosie Grier coming out of Penn State
I got a feeling I'm a psychotic civilian
I'm Michael Carter Williams with the rock I'm dealing
Mass native of Philly
[?] on your grilly
Castrate up until he
Gets sprayed up on ceiling
For rapping 'bout a milli, willie only got a 5 to his name
Me and Syze run the game, Pharaoh biz that's our lane
Hyena shit, deep in the layer
Me and the mic got bond tight like Reef and Isiah

So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one"
