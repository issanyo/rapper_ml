[Verse One] [Big Noyd]:
Yo it’s the N-O-Y-D, Q.B. first infantry
Mr. Air-it-out, Give Up Your Goods, do your history
Hip's where the pistol be, wrists all glittery
On the grind and I got a bad bitch form Cicily
You think of G you picture me, cops keep frisking me
Cause I stay fresh like a mouth full of Listerine
Ready for whatever whenever, you hear me man?
Niggas like "Noyd chill", but niggas wanna kill me man damn
Niggas wanna get me for my Benjamin's, but stop
Cause I’ll put the fucking Glock to your next of kin
I keep it militant, don’t make the barrel spin
His like Cypress Hill I Could Just Kill A Man
Sawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sipping on some Hennessy, puffing on a blunt
Going at your shorty, your shorty’s trying to stunt
I’m like la-la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
You see the slums, the gutter, the ghetto, the dirt
The drama, the narcs, the sharks, the metal, the work
The spics, the chinks, the niggas, the gods, and the earths
The loss, the pain, the evil, the wicked, the hurt
The thugs, the slugs, the gangs, the gangster, the turf
The diesel, the haze, the h, the ex, or the perc
The bodies, the bullets, the chalk, the blood, and the hearse
What you expect? It’s what we rep

[Verse Two] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
Yo from Queen’s Bridge to Free's crib (Philly)
Put the chrome where your teeth is and tell you to breathe in
Inhale my clip, I’m off the deep end
I train in the mountains like Batman Begins
The nicest niggas was rocking bombers and sheepskins
I’m a cannibal, I break bones and eat skin
It’s all real with me homeboy, you pretend
I’m all day with it, you thug on the weekend
I hold mines, smoke dro and blow nines
I rep myself, you need a motherfucking co-sign
Like a car loan, I’m a star homes
Break your jaw bone, big headed bitch like Star Jones
And I’m gone not before I grip a Glock
Shoot a rapper to death, now that’s real hip hop
Stop talking like you will cause you will not
I’m from where they sling more heroin than Gil Scott

[Chorus] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
You see the slums, the gutter, the ghetto, the dirt
The drama, the narcs, the sharks, the metal, the work
The spics, the chinks, the niggas, the gods, and the earths
The loss, the pain, the evil, the wicked, the hurt
The thugs, the slugs, the gangs, the gangster, the turf
The diesel, the haze, the h, the ex, or the perc
The bodies, the bullets, the chalk, the blood, and the hearse
What you expect? It’s what we rep
