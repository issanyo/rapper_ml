[Scratch Chorus]:
"Test me you must be bent G"
"Tap all jaws, lay down laws"
"From the ground up we lock shit"
"With full force my team will go at your main source"
"Blood flood your eye fuck up your optic"
"Switch to killer instincts"
"I'll draw first blood be the first to set it off" - Mobb Deep 'Hell On Earth'

[Verse One] [Scandal]:
Thoughts of the song provider, 32 bar writer
You workin' on new shit? Me too, but my joints tighter
Step into the booth strong, fresh off of an all nighter
Replacing these dog tired MC's like a bald tire
My shit is fire
It's like I'm sippin' a Pepsi with Michael Jackson, smokin' crack with Richard Pryor
To inconspicuous to finger in a line up as a rhymer
So why these name droppers bringin' mine up?
Cause I could give a god damn who got drama
Nigga, I'm dark skinned, never been a dot commer
Scared they gon' try to tie me to Osama
Thanks to marijuana and a paranoid mama
From weary old timer to young buck
Throw your guns up, I strike with a mic like a nun chuck
Plus I write from midnight till the sun's up
To come up with shit when I spit will get every one up
Y'all with us, start spittin' really, who want what?
We can get it on (right now)
Cause anybody I ain't ripped apart yet, Lost Cauze already shitted on
Now we got 'em stressin' cause Kwestion 'bout to spin a joint

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Tap all jaws, lay down laws"
"With full force my team will go at your main source"
"Switch to killer instincts"

[Verse Two] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
Fuck a bar count
I make my money at the bar count
In search of a stupid bitch with a smart mouth
Suck me beautiful
I have star clout
Me and Scan on the mic so bring your dogs out
And they better have rabies
Promoters wanna book me for a show then they better have gravy
Pay I or wave bye
I've been nice since Zack Morris and AC Slater was up in Bayside
Glad they never gave time for great rhymes
Cause I'd be upstate dressed in orange like I played for Jim Boeheim
Me and Malcolm share the same mind
Every MC has a ?
Motherfucker name mine
There ain't none, you go to war with a paint gun
When it comes to flow I'm the one you take from
Doc Scan got his doctorate in rockin' shit
And I'm workin' on gettin' my masters in the ancient art of dominance

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Test me you must be bent G"
"Bloody your mouth so you can taste it"
"From the ground up we lock shit"
"Illuminate, let's get it done right"
"Strike back with more hot shit"
"Illuminate, let's get it done right, my clique air tight"
"Switch to killer instincts"

[Verse Three] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
Yo, music vivid like we makin' movies
I'm so ill I can kill you and your dudies, talkin' like Baby Stewie
(Your incompetence is mind numbing)
I know people who stay the same and never tried nothin'
Cauze Supremacy I'm spy huntin', got your bitch thighs pumpin'
Despise justice unless it's carried out with nine's bustin'
What a paradox
You hate and I love it
These are the laws of the Cauze, never break thy coven

[Scandal]:
I was on they brainwave before they wanted to rhyme
Two weeks before a pay day, I lived 'em one at a time
Anyone who's been awake before the sun in the sky
In front of the lines, sick of seein' none of the pie
Got no money to buy shit and love to get high
Now Jada got you wonderin' Why
One more time
Just ask Reef man, these dudes don't get it
They identify the truth through the grooves on record

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Test me you must be bent G"
"Bloody your mouth so you can taste it"
"Tap all jaws lay down laws"
"Let's get it done right, my clique airtight"
"We take what was yours"
"Test me you must be bent G"
"Bloody your mouth so you can taste it"
"Your whole set up, from the ground up, we lock shit"
"Switch to killer instincts"
"Illuminate my team will strike back with more hot shit"
"Tap all jaws lay down laws"
"With full force my team will go at your main source"
"Blood flood your eye fuck up your optic"
"From the ground up we lock shit"
