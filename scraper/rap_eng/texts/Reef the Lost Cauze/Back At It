[Intro]:
Hello. And welcome to, A Vicious Cycle. Please, enjoy the music...but what ever you do...

[Hook]:
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"

[Verse One]:
Ayo it's Reef The Lost Cauze, whoopdediwoo
Half man, half animal, Zoobilee Zoo
People often stop me when I'm maneuverin' through
Sayin', "Hold it down for Philly like you usually do."
I reply, "Ya damn skippy." I am 50
Before he got shot, these pussies just can't hit me
I'm the equivalence of ridiculous
You know who I am, you are all witnesses
The son of Jor El with a gun and a el
From where the winters is cold and the summers is hell
Old vultures and young birds with somethin' to sell
If not, waitin' to rob you under the L
Dear America, you motherfuckers have failed
Cause a nigga either die in the street or suffer in jail
There's no in-between, unless you gettin' green
Ain't no inheritance from my heritage, so by any means
Reef is back

[Hook]:
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"

[Verse Two]:
I got a girl that loves me, a girl that don't respect me
My black joint Shaneeka, my white joint Becky
An A&R told me, I wasn't ready
He now works at Burger King, "I'll have a Pepsi."
With my meal, labels make me sign waivers with my deal
That I won't get my steel
And run up in the office like, "Fuck you pay me."
I started my own label, Fuck You Pay Me
Y'all been hemmin' and hawwin', I've been sittin' and thawin'
But I'm back in this bitch, kickin' and clawin'
? is drawn, don't fuck up my zone, come to your home
Pop you while I rock the suit like Brother Mouzone
I'm the brother, who pulled another sword from the stone
You flip burgers, I cop Jordan's in Rome
Eyego's a legend
That's the boy to me
You don't want beats from him? Fuck it just means more for me
And we

[Hook]:
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
Don't call it a comeback
"We back at it again"
