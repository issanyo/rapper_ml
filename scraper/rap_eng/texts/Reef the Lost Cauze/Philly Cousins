[Verse One]
The Lost Cauze is the new truth
Off the hinges with screws loose
I'll put the deuce deuce to your ear like a Bluetooth
You're cous cous, soft as a pile of dust
I'll get you stuck in South Philly like that fucking [?] truck
Listen Reef is a monster eating lasagna
With a freak chick from Ghana blowing the sweetest of ganja
Ice cold
I gotta sleep in a sauna
Yeah you keeping it 'G', you keeping it garbage
Season's upon us
[?] when the fifth is in reach, call me Pistol and Pete
Burying brothers, may you be married in slumber
And I'm taking more mushrooms than the Mario Brothers
This is Duck Hunt with the orange chrome you're a horror clone
Leave you charred discarded bones with these bars of stone
You are far from home searching for a wizard
White boys can rap, but still searching for the rhythm
The prodigal beast, I'll rob you like Nas and Kelis
The race is over you still tying your sneaks
I'm defying the beat and angering the microphone
Cutting glass to slice his dome
It was nice to know him

[Hook]
Yo you feel me cousin?
Yo who really want it?
This is Philly cousin and we really bugging
Blow your brains out, pause, it's really nothing
Yo you feel me cousin?
Yo who really want it?
This is Philly cousin and we really bugging
Yeah, yeah, yeah Dumhi you feel me cousin?

[Verse Two]
Look at life through a warrior's eyes
The glorious mind when the nine Flash like the Furious Five
Word to the wise I'm wisdom wickedly woven
Into the fabric of the ghetto's most filthiest clothing
Imperial oceans
I'm god of the seas
But on land I'm with gorillas at the top of the trees
And we swinging down on you, chopping your knees
You don't have to fear man when you father the seeds
My [?]
You can be conscious but still pull a pistol and pop shit
Nonsense
My response to the obvious is that I'm mad to the bone and sicker than Hodgkin
A soldier of war, this where the [?]
More stripes than a closet full of top tens
And I swear to you
As long as my top spins
I will rule and leave you no option
I'm the Dark Knight but this isn't Gotham
This is Dumhi, son why this is a problem
Yeah, The Lost Cauze is keeping his promise
To scramble your brains like I'm eating a fucking omelette
