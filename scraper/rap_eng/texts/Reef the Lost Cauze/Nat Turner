[Verse 1]
Here I stand, a man not free
Whip markers on my back, shackles on both feet
Picking cotton in the stone heat
Played along my soul keep for one day he came and told me
In the year of 1831 I awoke at dawn
To see his vision in the sun
It seemed that the clouds parted tippling off his tongue
And he said "My son, the revolution has begun"
And with that, I knew the message was clear
We'll kill the suppressor who kept us in prison for years
Raped our women in laughter and tears
Made us build their meal while they sit back in their chairs
Late night, I chat with my peers, we build weapons
No guns, we must slice them from neck to the ears
With spears, so they can hear
The pain of the people who are God's creation, not theirs

[Refrain]x2
I'm the one that they don't teach you in class about
I'm the one who ran up in the master's house
Put a knife to his neck and then gagged his mouth
Charged him for black murder, I'm Nat Turner

[Verse 2]
Through the darkness, we march like hellions
They called it a massacre, I call a rebellion
We moved quickly, with no time to spare
Blood loss, leave no life to spare
Women and children neither
After we freed our brothers we burned down the house to ensure no survivors
A horseback we rode, blood dripping from the hooves
Head out 'till dawn, resist in the woods
Then we attack again, ravish them
The braids slashed against the master's plastic skin
The murder was so passionate
Screaming to the heavens, we would never ever go back again
Word began to spread, up the violent mall
That wolf walked the wicked into the side of God
This was where the demise begins
It was written in my tan, we all need to come to a violent end

[Refrain]x2

[Verse 3]
After two days of non-stop action we rested
In the back-roads of a [?], you got hit by the night crescent
It was here I began to fight my confessions
Before I knew it was only a matter of time 'fore they catch us
A house nigga got scared, ran to the county building
Told them our whereabouts, then they beat him 'till they killed him
In the starry night I saw the flames from the distance
Attacked us while we slept, but this time we're different
We fought back
But the slaves told me the revolution would only stop if they caught Nat
So again on horseback I rode, negate the chase
Caught up with me eventually, had to face fate
They hung me, kept my head as a souvenir
Beat slaves to death as they were consumed with fear
You got the uprising of blacks on happening, and attack further
Because of the name Nat Turner

[Refrain]x2
