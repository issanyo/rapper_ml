[Hook x2: Big Kurt]
Lyricism is cool again, Reef we got a chance
But the industry is the devil and I don't fucking dance
Not a fucking chance, just look in my eyes
You can see I'm real at a fucking glance

[Verse 1: Big Kurt]
Most of these motherfuckers ain't on my level
Rappers be boring me, I made a dollar outta pebble
Life was watery, but I slapped the shit out the devil
I've lived horribly, if you started with the dominant nickel
You had more than me, that's probably honestly why I'm honory
I can't live ordinary, shit needs to be more than merry
I've been a little slick prick since I was kicked in my shit at letty
I ain't talking 'bout a hammer when I say I'm clicking a stick
This mix big as deadly, I spit shit that's heavy
You got to admit just from this you know I'm sick already
Reef I don't think they ready
For the way that I plan to give it to 'em, fuck it
Giving it, I'm winning, busting in, now I'm grinning
From the beginning, I be killing any beat I was given
I'mma keep ripping till I no longer continue living
Never giving a fuck, its pointless, even trying to suppress my vision

[Hook x2: Big Kurt]
Lyricism is cool again, Reef we got a chance
But the industry is the devil and I don't fucking dance
Not a fucking chance, just look in my eyes
You can see I'm real at a fucking glance

[Verse 2: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Yeah the black face with the menaces there
Vision is clear, trigger is here, vicious as bears
This is the year that nigga you hear
Get the [?] to spare, listen I dare any y'all speak up
You got some feelings to share?
Get your clique merked, fucking with Cauze and Big Kurt
Dig earth, black suits, big church
Mom crying, wife sick, kids hurt
Now I don't want that so ask yourself what its worth
Cause I'm the wickedest since wicked was
So word use the sentences, infinite penmanship
You an infants prick, step on my cypher, I dominate you
You just a actor, the academy should nominate you
I'll fuck around and just stomp on your tooth
Stomp on your chest, yeah dog I'm Ndamukong Suh
I'm just a rowdy motherfucker that go wild for my crew
And they say I'm the best when my rhyming is through, Cauze

[Hook x2: Big Kurt]
Lyricism is cool again, Reef we got a chance
But the industry is the devil and I don't fucking dance
Not a fucking chance, just look in my eyes
You can see I'm real at a fucking glance

[Verse 3: Big Kurt]
Almost impossibly polished, better acknowledge whats flawless
All this ain't even what a full thought is, you honestly wanna know
What might get me scoped out from the dome, honesty
Lower taxes for rich people, now that's just low
It makes us unfenestrated, a boat load of gold for a bowl of coal
How would you cope dealing with reality?
You need to keep composed
My lyrics are for an unmatched euphoria without a lethal dose
Paint my views before you speak, for years artists believe in clues
They ain't really like all that shit, you be seeing fools
But it seems that music gimmicks keep people confused
So here I am with the news, don't act like you weren't told before
Immortal Technique said it
If Eminem could do it again he'd be esoteric
Yes I meant it, call me demented
But watch me keep my soul and somehow still end up remembered
