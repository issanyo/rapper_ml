[Verse 1]
I heard Rome wasn't built in a day, but it fell in one
World full of dreams, buying or you selling 'em
Sometimes you can't get ahead cause of your melanin
It's hard to move on with a closet full of skeletons
Feel like we'll never win, in debt we forever in
People are dying and they can't afford they medicine
Fake friends I had to sever them
Cause when I needed a helping hand dawg, it was never them
Remember when we was young kids?
Hungry, didn't think about money
Sit and twisting something lovely
Talking 'bout what you gon' do next
Misplaced the few steps
And now we 9 to 5 living off two checks
Or drug money that we gotta keep flipping
Knee deep in this bullshit but never play the victim
Long as my heart ticking, I ain't taking what they given
I'ma pivot, baby need new shoes so I'ma get 'em
And I'm

"I'm doing the very best I can"
Every day of my life
"I'm doing the very best I can"
Cause every day is a fight
"I'm doing the very best I can"
I'm just trying to do right
"I'm doing the very best I can"
"I'm doing the very best I can"
Every day of my life
"I'm doing the very best I can"
Cause every day is a fight
"I'm doing the very best I can"
I'm just trying to do right
"I'm doing the very best I can"

[Verse 2]
I'm 31 with a growing family
So my desire for this music shit is starting to fade rapidly
I keep boxing
Reality, I keep dodging
An alcoholic with a weed problem, streets keep calling
I'm trying not to answer
I need to quit smoking, yo I worry about cancer
I'm overweight by like 20 or 30
And I'm quick to pop off if niggas act like they ain't heard me
But if you observe me you'll know my heart is big
You know if I got it you got it my nigga, I'll split all of it
You know I'll have your back and I
Talk about my son with a love that is magnified
So nah, I'm not the baddest guy
I got my flaws and all
But ain't too much bad niggas you can say about the boy
Fuck trying to spit good verses
Cause right now I'm working on being a good man a good person
