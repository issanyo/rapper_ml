[Hook]
We ain't mean to ruin all the fun you was having
Just wanted you to hear the sound of the guns we was blasting
Nah we wasn't invited, we decided to crash it
Kick us out then this place will get burned into ashes

[Verse One]
Still spitting the illest shit you ever heard in life
Snowgoons bring me from Hell see I was frozen ice
My body was found in the middle of the Artic
Parked and right next to the dog shit that's in Clark Kent
I'm bound to blow like Krypton
I keep it Shade45 nigga, always got the Fif' on
You got cornrows and face tats, can't play ball or rap for shit
Ya life's a waste face facts
You need to call Everest
Ayo Reef The Lost Cauze, Reef The Lost Terrorist
Reef The Boss heroin shine like Con Edison
Only six foot but with the shottie I'm like 7'10"

[Hook] {x2}

[Verse Two]
Uh
And I mean that literally
I'll fuck you up, I don't mean rapping, I mean that physically
I mean I'm always down to battle
But go too far and I'll strangle you till I crush your fucking Adam's Apple
As evil as the snake that ate Adam's apple
Leave 'em mad and baffled
Cause the facts prove a sad truth and that news is half you rap dudes is sheep
The other half of you is cattle
I never let them brand the dreaded Reef
I hate the word "brain" it reminds me of old folks and Shredded Wheat
The flows so sweet, I'm on a sugar high
You ever come to one of our shows then you should've died
I died
Yeah, many years ago
But now I'm resurrected and these niggas still fear my ghost
All you see is fire, all you hear is smoke
I'm in a clown mask at your door, "Knock, knock wanna hear a joke?"

[Hook] {x2}

[Outro: Reef talking]
Brotherhood. Snowgoons. Reef The Lost motherfucking Cauze. A beautiful musical marriage wouldn't you agree? You motherfuckers can't stand. You can't stand. Kneel before Zod
