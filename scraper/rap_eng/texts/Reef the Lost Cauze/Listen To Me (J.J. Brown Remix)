[Verse One]:
Guess who's back
The underground champ homie, yes who's that?
C'mon now, you know who got it locked son
Get the club overcrowded like Babygrande roster
80 man mobster, I'm one of the greats
Homie, ain't a dude live as me in your whole state, homie
Pump your breaks homie
Just let me talk to 'em
You bought your fans guaranteed I'll walk with 'em
You go on trips, take chicks to the airport
I glide by you like the movin' strip at the airport
Hold that flight, you ain't never heard a flow that nice
The kid with the gold/black Nikes
Oh that's trife, on a roll like thrown back dice
Your girl can't rap but she can blow that mic
Illest nigga in the game, I know that like
Lost Cauze is the future and you know that's right

[Hook]:
Shawty walk with me, you lead the way
Just talk with me, what you need to say ma?
Just listen to me, listen to me
Just listen to me, listen to me
Fall back, let the O.G. groove
Don't make me draw that, you don't know me dude
Just listen to me, listen to me
Just listen to me, listen to me

[Verse Two]:
Look dawg
I know you got the liquor in you, niggas with you
Frontin' real hard, like you got that pistol with you
I can see it inside your face, you in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
From playin' a role
You little rat ass niggas need to stay in your hole
I'm up here with players and hoes
You actin' all crazy, I kick back, smoke the haziest 'dro
Get the whole crowd hype with the laziest flow
Stop tellin' me to rhyme, they pay me to flow
I told 'em
Just listen to me, listen to me
But he wouldn't
Just listen to me, listen to me
So unfortunately, how I gotta conclude
Gotta be rude, end up knockin[ the snot outta this dude
I ain't wanna have to hit this man
But when it came down to it he wasn't listenin'

[Hook]:
Homie fall back, let the O.G. groove
Don't make me draw that, you don't know me dude
Just listen to me, listen to me
Just listen to me, listen to me
Walk with me, you lead the way
Just talk with me, what you need to say ma?
Just listen to me, listen to me
Just listen to me, listen to me

[Verse Three]:
Look at the body God blessed you with
I'm glad He gave me two eyes for me to undress you with
You extra thick, back side is excellent
I'm ready to break the heart that's hangin' from your necklace
She walked up on me without no hesitance
Told me to schooch over so I could come let her sit
Ain't no need for embellishment, I don't tell her shit
Like my dick is bigger than an elephants
That's irrelevant, intelligence is how I conquer her mind
I know what she wanna hear so I'm tellin' her lies
She just wanna smash, I can tell in her eyes
Whispered in my ear that she's ready to slide
Told me that I could come back to the spot
And that I crash there, I said, "Cool as long as you got cab fare."
I ain't a pimp or a mack
I'm just a nigga that sit in the back, spittin' his raps simple as that

[Hook]:
Shawty walk with me, you lead the way
Just talk with me, what you need to say ma?
Just listen to me, listen to me
Just listen to me, listen to me
Fall back, let the O.G. groove
Don't make me draw that, you don't know me dude
Just listen to me, listen to me
Just listen to me, listen to me
Fall back, let the O.G. groove
Don't make me draw that, you don't know me dude
Just listen to me, listen to me
Just listen to me, listen to me
Walk with me, you lead the way
Just talk with me, what you need to say ma?
Just listen to me, listen to me
Just listen to me, listen to me
