[Intro]:
[Bill Wilcock]:
This is Bill Wilcock reporting to you live from south Philadelphia, USA. Where one time titan Reef The Lost Cauze is coming out of retirement
Bob what are your thought on this?

[Bob]:
I think the kid doesn't have a shot in hell. He's been outta the game way too long he's old. These new kids today they don't care about fundamentals, they just go for the throat

[Verse One]:
Yo spazz out like I smoke dust
Get your soul crushed
A.O.T.P. greatest group since Cold Crush
Fucked up your head like bowl cuts
Run up on you with cowboys and indians like a gold rush
And you know what?
You ain't so tough
I pump iron like "Dah I'm so buff."
This beats so tough I'm just killin' it
Y'all all the same but I'm just different
You wanna be down you asking for a membership
Late registration you download feminine
With hoes I'm a gentlemen pull chairs out and all
An hour later she suckin the air out my balls
You on my dick like you wearing my draws
If you nice DMX is scared of a dog
Nerd rappers on stage making the dork face
We was playing GI Joe you at the Strawberry Shortcake
I smoke weed green as a port snake
By noon already on my forth 8th
We burn down cities and torch states
On the stage with a fuckin' burner in a Northface

[Hook]:
Tear this shit down what I came to do
Brought the banger too just to aim at you
I point at your dome, amazin' view
We get live like cable this is Pay-Per-View
Say Attica
Attica
Attica
Attica
Fat bitches give the best head
You'll be next dead
Red dot your motherfuckin face like a redhead

[Verse Two]:
Freckle your knot, Heckler and Koch
"Fuck you officer." Disrespecting the cops
Your chest'll get popped
I'm on drugs mescal and pot
Got love for wack niggas especially not
On some white dude's shit
I'm ready to rock
Here I come, ready or not, confetti your top
Bang this out on every block
And if they ask about the kid just tell 'em he hot
And he'll fuck up your props in a blink of a eye
Dr. King had A Dream why you think that he died
Your mans a bitch and you think that he'll ride
I think he'll lie and leave your ass to fry
Like chicken do I drink bitches brew
Have your dumbass asking why I'm hittin' you
Proud black man
But I'm a nigga too vicious too
Your album couldn't fuck with my interview

[Hook]:
Tear this shit down what I came to do
Brought the banger too just to aim at you
I point at your dome, amazin' view
We get live like cable this is Pay-Per-View
Say Attica
Attica
Attica
Attica
Fat bitches give the best head
You'll be next dead
Red dot your motherfuckin face like a redhead

[Outro]:
[Bill Wilcock]:
Hahaha well he certainly shut you the fuck up huh?

[Bob]:
Yeah well you know sometimes these old guys...they still got the fight in 'em. I didn;t know the kid had it in 'em, but he still got something special

[Bill Wilcock]
Are you drunk?

[Bob]:
Yes. Yes I am
