[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I'm a man of the people, I'm a man of the cloth
No I'm not a religious man, I'm a man of the lost
I'm not a man of the law, I am animal paw
I am a man that fought the elephants when Hannibal charged
I'm a man of the broken, I am a man of the healed
I'm a man of the chosen, I am a man of my will
I am a man that is angry, I am a man that is chill
I am a man that has lied, I am a man that has killed
I'm a man that's in prison, I am a man on the run
I'm a man with a masters, I am a man with a gun
I am a man in a suit, I am a man in a hoodie
I am the bad bad man you only seen in the movies
I am a man in the jungle, I am a man amongst apes
I am the man in the mirror, I am the man you can't face
I am a man with a plan, I am a man that is slacking
I am a man that will talk, I am the man that is clapping
I am a man of the year, I am a man that is trapping
I am a man that talks shit, I am a man that makes it happen
I am a man that is balling, I am the man that is cheap
I am a man that is stronger, I am a man that is weak
I'm a man of my word, I am a man that is lying
I am a man that gave up, I'm a man that is trying
I am a man that loves peace, I'm a man that loves drama
I'm a man who hates daddy, I am a man that loves mama
I'm a man of respect, I'm a man of the world
I'm the man of my hood, I'm a man to my girl
And I'm a man to my son, I'm a man to my brother
I'm a man that will flourish, I am a man that will suffer
I am a man with a purpose, I am a man that is lost
I am a man that is trusting, I am a man that was crossed
I'm a man with a future, I'm a man with a past
I'm a man who was sober, I'm the man with the flask
I am the man who was rocking with a whole lot of cash
And I'm the man walking behind 'em, rocking a mask
I am the man who was faithful, I am the man that is cheating
I am the man who is awake, I am the man that is sleeping
I am the man that is starving, I am the man that is eating
I am the man who is stuck, I am the man who is leaving
I am the man who is quiet, I am the man that is loud
I am a man that's grown, I'm a man that's a child
I'm a man in the crowd, I'm the man in the front
I'm a man that is prey, I am a man that will hunt
I am a man that is pure, I am a man that is evil
Because I'm a man that knows a man that's really two people
I'm the bredrin

[A portion of a motion picture Full Metal Jacket]
Pogue Colonel: Marine, what is that button on your body armor?
Private Joker: A peace symbol, sir
Pogue Colonel: Where'd you get it?
Private Joker: I don't remember, sir
Pogue Colonel: What is that you've got written on your helmet?
Private Joker: "Born to Kill", sir
Pogue Colonel: You write "Born to Kill" on your helmet and you wear a peace button. What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?
Private Joker: No, sir
Pogue Colonel: You'd better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you
Private Joker: Yes, sir
Pogue Colonel: Now answer my question or you'll be standing tall before the man
Private Joker: I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir
Pogue Colonel: The what?
Private Joker: The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir
Pogue Colonel: Whose side are you on, son?
