First you drop out of school, then you get yourself a job
But it doesn't pay enough, so then you move back in with mom
Now you spend all of your time just writin' rhymes and gettin' high
Welcome to this life of mine. This is how you lose your mind

[Verse 1]
Hello, boys and girls it's uncle Reef
I'm back to tell you a brand new tale
About how you can try in life
But in the end you'll always fail
I'm in jail, well not really
Just seems that I've been cursed
You see children
I am living with the lady who game me birth
Could be worse ummm...
No, not really, you see kids I am grown
I was out on my own
Now I'm living back at home
Where'd I go wrong?
How I got here thats a story within itself
Got a little time I'll drop this rhyme
Maybe you could offer some help

[Hook]

Welcome to this life of mine. This is how you lose your mind
This is...

[Verse 2]
So I'm in school right, got a cool new life
In the dorms blowin' orange and brew lights with two dikes
Smut-ass, cut class, just to puff ash
It was fun then, lookin' back I fucked up bad
Lost my scholarship
Ain't nothing in my wallet kid
But a condom and in the fridge is condiments
So my pride i swallowed it
Now I'd like you to listen
To the following conversation
Call mom, she ragin', said with me shes lost all patience
It's up to me to make the payments
On the student loans and no way in hell am I movin' home
I'd told her I'd get a job and shit, I don't think she was impressed
This is the life of a college drop out way before some Kanye West, nigga please

[Verse 3]
Job to job, check to check
Crib to crib, livin' neck to neck
With roommates never payin' rent by the due date
In my mouth no food taste, just toothpaste
It was one or the other
I was a step away from being a bum in the gutter
But I'm the son of my mother
She sees my tryin', rib startin' to show she sees me dyin'
Makes me and offer I can't refuse
At home I can move, til I'm back on my shoes
On my feet rather, full circle in my life without a complete chapter
It's kind of hard with everybody in the streets laughing
Cause went back in the womb from the tomb
Presume the unpredictabul, roomin' at home, peep the visual
At least I got new material, ma' we ain't got no more cereal

What you mean we ain't got no more cereal?
Ma', we ain't got no more cereal, ma'
Well get yo ass to the store and get you cereal, your grown!
*Sigh*
God damn it!

[Verse 4]
See at first I was hesitant about my new residence
I though I'd regret it
But it turned out a blessing in disguse but I
Still need a setitive
To deal with the recklessness of livin' with my relatives
It's not so bad but my credit is that level and
Feels like a second chance id never get it in my head forever damn
Tryin' to guess my days like the weatherman, whatever man
I'd never stand on my own again, have my own home again
Uncle skip and my declone the ham
I live in my little sisters old bedroom
Bang my head on the ceiling everytime my head move
It's the best move
No girls gonna respect you
When you rest in the nest dude
I should just move, but I'm not stable enough
I'm not able and there's food on the table, free cable and stuff
I'm not payin for stuff, I'm not payin for stuff
