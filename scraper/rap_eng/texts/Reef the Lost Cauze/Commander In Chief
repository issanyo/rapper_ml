[Verse One]
Eardrums I smash you
You're lookin' at a natural
That's word to your mother, father, Peter, Paul and Matthew
And any asshole that wanna tassel
Reef will eat 'em up and hok-ppf like a motherfuckin' cashew
I belong in a rap zoo
With a sign that reads, "Please, don't feed the angry black dude"
Cause that's when he snaps dude
Grabs poop and starts throwin' it
I'm just a gorilla who learn to flow and shit
I can be so inappropriate
But in the next bar spit a phrase that's deep as the ocean get
You hope I quit, [?]
I'll beat you to a pulp and use your body as a mop to sop up the blood
I'm very nice
In every fight, Reggie White
You Aikman, I pop your body like you was tryin' to break dance
Rhyme WildStyle
Been doin' this for awhile now
Spit razors that be so blazin' they singe your fuckin' eyebrow
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
I'm not trying to get the world to change
Just get your girl to slurp my mayne
I'm Hercules droppin' guillotines on you Mini-Mes
You need to freeze, you know who it be

[Hook]
The commander in chief
Stand on your feet
Give me praise when I come to the stage, arms raised
I will amaze, homie check my resume
It's Snuff man on the beat, goddamn it it's Reef

[Verse Two]
And now that I'm high
Oh I forgot I'm never not
I just smoked and that makes not a minute gone by
That me, myself and I haven't rolled the lah
And blazed up motherfucker, raise up motherfucker
Shoot the place up
Psych, nah, I'm just kidding
The only time I really bust is when your mom's pay a visit (the milkman!)
I'm sick wit it, keep it cookin'
And flow so tight I got Jew broads
Pinchin' my cheek callin' me "Reefer Snookins"
That wasn't a racist joke but did I shock ya?
Oh I'm sorry, was that your face my hand hit, did I sock ya?
The hottest MC in your house is not ya
And you live alone with a puppy named Sasha, I'm a monster
Don't be scared
You wasn't prepared
You like a joke that keeps gettin' funnier and funnier
Keep laughin'
Keep gaspin' for air
Now are all y'all with me up in here?
If not, I'mma cry backstage, psych
I give a fuck about none of y'all cause bitch I'm paid
I'm rich beeyotch
My momma laughed and said "You wish beeyotch
Pay the rent beeyotch."
I'm not serious
I've been smokin' so much homie I think I'm delirious
Fuck how ya feel, no motions involved
When I grab a pen and paper and fuck a beat raw
I'm Lost Cauze

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
And I'm blastin' off bangin' on niggas like basketball
While you only get respect overseas like David Hasselhoff
What's the matter dawg
Are you mad cause I keep waving this red flag like a deranged matador?
Just kickin' the dust up
Send me your man I'll rip him the fuck up
And leave his body parts in four different dump trucks
You dudes is numb nuts
Don't make me wild on stage
And tie two mics together and use them shits as nunchucks
You want what?
Not a damn thang
It's Lost Cauze playboy, I run the damn game
And bars I spit sickly
And I could drop 50 but I'm tired so the hook
Come on, sing it with me

[Hook]
