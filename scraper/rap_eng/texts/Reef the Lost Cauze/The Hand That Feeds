[Intro: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Whoo
Bang, bang
The Majestic
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Reef the Lost Cauze]
I got some things I wanna address, so take your seat
I'm a man of many words, but I'mma make this brief
With all that fronting and faking, I have had enough of it
I don't entertain nonsense or tolerate sucka shit
Unfortunately it seems that that is all you offer me
From here on out I advice you move cautiously
There's a price you will pay and that is an awful fee
See me in your nightmares, right where the monsters be
I'm not the wolfman, I'm more like Mephistopheles
So keep one eye open like the giant in the Odyssey
No matter what you offer I'll promise me
I've reached the point now that I am no longer thinking logically
Like I think about your demise everytime I eat
Like it would bring me nothing but joy to see your momma grief
And that's real talk, word life I'm dead
And I'm coming for everything that's yours, just a heads-up

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze]
There's no one you can trust in this land of greed
But I'm an animal, I bite the hand that feeds
I don't give a fuck who you are or plan to be
All I care about out here is my fam and me
There's no one you can trust in this land of greed
But I'm an animal, I bite the hand that feeds
I don't give a fuck who you are or plan to be
All I care about out here is my fam and me– me

[Verse 2: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Keep your mouth shut, I don't need your two cents
Nowadays it seems that a mile is a new inch
Figured that math and figured that last–
Thing you heard was my voice before the trigger went blast
Why dress up a monkey or put a pig in a bath?
Thinking you big or you bad'll get you ripped in a half
Now you talk behind my back? Psh... that shit is just sad
Running your mouth like a clown, that's how niggas get trashed
That's how wives get kidnapped and houses get blown up
And judges get paid off, witnesses never show up
A hundred goons'll come for you if I say so
I understand now how Micheal felt when he gets [?]
I did this to you, I want you to remember that
Respect is like [?] you can't get it back
I'm now done discussing my feelings
Now I want your muthafucking brains to cover the ceiling, [?]

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze]
There's no one you can trust in this land of greed
But I'm an animal, I bite the hand that feeds
I don't give a fuck who you are or plan to be
All I care about out here is my fam and me
There's no one you can trust in this land of greed
But I'm an animal, I bite the hand that feeds
I don't give a fuck who you are or plan to be
All I care about out here is my fam and me– me– me– me– me

[Outro: Reef the Lost Cauze]
That's it muthafucka
Fuck you
Fuck your homies
Fuck your squad
Fuck your council
Fuck your posse
Whatever you dickheads call yourself
I'll smack the fuck outta you
And tell you to go get your pops
Nigga
