[Intro: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yup! A.O.T.P., JuJu Mob
Reef the Lost Cauze
Snowgoons, another classic
This for all you hatin'-ass bastards
This what I tell 'em nowadays
Yo, yo!

[Verse 1: Reef the Lost Cauze]
From the city of Godless, Philly the hardest
It don't matter what I say they wanna kill me regardless
They say I'm a MC, but really an artist
Simply DaVinci, peep your pain and draw it
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm posessed, word, spear your flesh like harpoon
All you are now in tune to the illest MC's
Try to mimic, but don't sound as cool
How can you dupe a dummy? Astound a fool
Spit so much, you will drown in drool
You're a bunch of clowns and coons that'll get found in dunes
A plastic hammer; basically a childish tool
You wild as who? I'll defile your crew
You must be trippin' like a thousand 'shrooms, I'm the truth
You're the lie in the flesh, I put tires to neck
They describe you as sex, I'm as live as it gets
Pussy, stop gettin' your words tangled
Fuck around and just get your whole earth mangled
You be the first strangled
I come to your show, beat you down and then kill it at your merch table

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You can hate all you want - you will never beat it
You can fake all you want - you will never be it
You can wait all you want - you will never see it
You talk a lot of shit, but you ain't never mean it
You starvin' out here, dog - you are never eatin'
I'm walkin' out here, dog - we ain't never leavin'
You hold a gun and get chunked - you will never squeeze it
I had a gun all my life and I ain't never need it

[Verse 2: Reef the Lost Cauze]
I walk a strip that's narrow with a clique of pharoahs
Splits fifths and barrels in sick apparel
Kids is scarecrows
I roll with Snowgoons and they don't sing Christmas carols
No Frosty or Rudolph, you awfully and too soft
You fuckin' suck, you lost me at two bars
All I got in this world; a word and two balls
I'm in the wilderness spittin' moose calls
I am vermouth raw, you're a goofball
That's why no one knows who the fuck you are
I don't own a new car, I'm too far ahead of the traffic
I'm beheadin' you bastards
With the most majestic of magic
Well, not really, but you are gettin' your ass kicked
I spit battle raps to no one in particular
Just to do it and to remind MC's that I'm ill as fuck
The killer cuz with a killer buzz
I'm high, plus on the streets I got a killer buzz
Copped your CD, I feel you cuz
It's feeler music
Now I know what they mean by filler, what?

[Hook: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You can hate all you want - you will never beat it
You can fake all you want - you will never be it
You can wait all you want - you will never see it
You talk a lot of shit, but you ain't never mean it
You starvin' out here, dog - you are never eatin'
I'm walkin' out here, dog - we ain't never leavin'
You hold a gun and get chunked - you will never squeeze it
I had a gun all my life and I ain't never need it

[Outro: Reef the Lost Cauze]
Never, never, no, never, never, never
Snowgoons, Reef the Lost Cauze
We got another one
This need to be the fuckin' lead-off single and shit with the video
For real, cause ain't any-you know what I'm sayin'?
Ain't nobody fuckin with this man, you know that
Hahah, I'm just playin'
Well, not really, but I'm just playin'..
I'm out!
