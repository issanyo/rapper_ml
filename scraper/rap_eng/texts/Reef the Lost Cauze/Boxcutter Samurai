[Intro]
Have you ever heard the legend of the Boxcutter Samurai?
He was a great warrior

[Verse 1]
On the real none more alive than this
Just a rhyme with this
Your gonna need survival kits
Beat the flow and how live it is
Your team is all turkeys like [?]
Our sum is wild, y'all can't handle sun like Irish kids
You ain't never heard this type of shit
I spit on types of plague and viruses
I don't know what style it's in
Or what a stylus is
I just huff and puff and turn your house into a pile of bricks
Dialysis surrounded by heavy hate
You're testing fate
You die laughing like Chevy Chase
Wait, No way, no weight but it's got heavy bass/base
CBC we got heavyweights in every state
See me coming mean it's time to go
The lost cauze make you see stars like kaleidoscope
You must be high on dope
I don't even know how you grieve with so many dicks lodged inside your dome
It's the boxcutter samurai

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Smoke a glassy bowl
On the grassy knoll
Me and my man make classics like Abbey Road
I'm the baddest 'fro
I'll be gladly known as a nasty foe 'til I'm paid like Daddy Knowles
Word to Solange I bomb, I'm Pompeii
Three stacks like Andre, rap beyond gay
I bring that masculinity back
This, that, evaporate into raw energy rap
Keep the town wet
With spit that ain't reach the ground yet
[?] it's two legs and ran in fear of my sound check
Disgusting like a hound's breath, after he found flesh
Blood spews from pews
When I'm found dressed in the sharpest threads
I'm off my meds and you're marked for dead
Wearing dicks across your head
Wearing [?] as a skirt
You're a fucking jerk
Get your mother merced
Like she's a shuttleworth[?]
The boxcutter Samurai

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah. It's a lock cos I hold the key
Who you supposed to be?
The gold[?] MC?
To outdope MCs
Leave 'em holding like rosarys
Holds[?] a ring around the face so you won't know it's me
The game was taught rather than sold to me by the oldest G's
Who sell coke and love they kids and hold their toasters squeezed
Hurt in their eyes and scars on the back of their hands
Back to the bar playing cards with cigars in their hands
And inhale wisdom
And blow back a swarm of locusts
Man I'm focused
Stay well lit like royal oak is[?]
Be the opus
Snowgoons beats is focused
Animal in it to commit acts atrocious
FBI got posters and photos of my soldiers
Inside of black folders, trying to fool us
But we remain wizards that's cloakless
Open razor, black roses, to rap for Moses
The Samurai
