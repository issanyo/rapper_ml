[Verse 1]
He was a real nigga, stayed on the block pitching
He and his crew would rock jeans that said stop snitching
He wasn't the violent type but he would see evil on all kind of nights
And chose to remain the silent type
I'm not saying call the cops, the beast won't help
But shit in the hood we police ourselves
Hate on no man trying to increase his wealth
But don't turn your back on your neighbour when they need your help
And he did that night that they robbed that old lady
They ain't mean to kill her but the bitch went crazy
Seen the whole thing and just shut his blinds
But he couldn't get the image of her busted spine from his blunted mind
Time passed and the summer was sick
That was until his little brother got hit
Now he's out for answers but niggas stick to the script
So when he asked what happened ain't nobody seen shit

[Hook] [x2]
And there's only so long you can play devil's advocate
Before the snake comes back and now your back is bit
Half the worrying, half the risk
But a whole world of problems come from playing devil's advocate

[Verse 2]
He was the youngest VP of a Fortune 500
Porsche out front, Armani suits by the hundreds
His bosses screwed over anyone that they wanted
The type to fuck the wife and then fire the husband
The ruthless titans of industry
There's lawyers and accountants are more organized than the Genovese
Made plenty enemies but his logic was
If these people were smart then they'd be as rich as me
His ambition blinded him so
He was a good man once but loot divided his soul
Now his company is floundering, about to be jobless
He's under investigation for trading on stock tips
Reporters out back sifting through garbage
Got a lien on his house, they trying to take where his mom live
Went to his old boss who's met at the door
He said, "I'm sorry son, we've never met before."

[Hook] [x2]

[Verse 3]
Never turn a blind eye to the evil that's upon you
Cause if you do believe me that shit will haunt you
I remember a few years back I witnessed a heinous act
And I did not react, I sat back and just let it happen
I just sat there stunned, I should've helped but I guess I was young
I guess I was dumb, felt like a punk
The stench of guilt hung on my skin for weeks like a skunk
And to this day I see the face of a stranger
Who was drowning and I could've been her anchor
If I had to do it all again I would've stood tall and lent her my hand
I would've fought like a man, I would've come to her rescue and done all I can
But the fucked up thing is I'll never get that chance
Never never never

[Hook] [x2]
