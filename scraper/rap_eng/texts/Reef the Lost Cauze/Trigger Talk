[Intro]
Ease off the trigger talk, you ain’t killing shit

[Verse One] Bloodsport
You wanna nigga play predator and hunt a nigga
You gonna kill who, nigga? I will kill you
Easy to be brave from a distance, pussy
Rule number one better be busting your gun
Call my name and I’mma stand still
And wait for the aggressor, I’m better under pressure
Approach the perimeter, you maggot dinner
Yeah you fucking with the world’s top sinner, Bloodsport
I broke every commandment except one
I honoured my mother, protected her with a gun
I plays no games, the Uzi is sprayed
Your brains, just think of a head like a sprinkler
You can threaten me and Reef if you want to
Hunter becomes the hunted, the lions’ll hunt you
You nigga talk trigger talk, shit ain’t real
And you ain’t killing shit cause you don’t clap steel faggot

[Hook]
Trigger talk
Ease off the trigger talk
Ease off the trigger talk
You ain’t killing shit
Trigger talk
Ease off the trigger talk
Ease off the trigger talk
You ain’t killing shit

[Verse Two] Reef the Lost Cauze
Yo kill the trigger talk and the gun jab
Here’s a fun fact, if I see you you’d run laps
Like a trackstar, peel off like Nascar
Me and Bloodsport the hood version of Blackstar
Break your arm, break it again before the cast’s off
You’re some kind of genius, do you work for NASA?
It’s not rocket science, I have the foulest tyrant
Crying, screaming, please stop the violence
Won’t win, me and Sport hunting you down like that bull in No Country For Old Men
With that big thing stop talking shit man
Get your shit maimed when I click bang
Shit change in a split frame
You go from cool to shit stains walking with canes
It’s insane to keep on fronting like you busting
You fucker, you ain’t hurting nothing

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yo I see it in your eyes, you wouldn’t hurt a fly
And if I heard any different then I heard a lie
You ain’t a thug, you’re more like burger fries
Mop up the floor flunky, I swear to God I hope you die
I poke your eye with a blade that’s jagged
Somebody better save this faggot cause I swear I’ll trash him
Put him in gutters, it’s Guns and Butter
Lost Cauze, Bloodsport, now you’re all gonna suffer
Trust us, we leave you on crutches for that tough act
Send shots your way, you won’t bust back (nah never)
You’ll just duck that, run away, my homies be like fuck rap, fuck that
Don’t think you should rap, you’re too fucking special
Man somebody gonna test you, yeah somebody gonna check you
Watch what you say homie, I will catch you
And if not my nigga Sport won’t miss you

[Hook]
