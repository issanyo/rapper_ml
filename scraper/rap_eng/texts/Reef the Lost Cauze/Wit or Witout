[Intro]
I just need to get this said
With all due respect
You've put me down in this game
I didn't ask for that
Not even a handshake, make me want things
Things I can see, that I can almost touch
Then you take them away
Not from me right? Everyone else but not me

[Verse 1]
All I did was fight for you
Studio for days, broke night for you
No sleep red-eye flights for you
Think about it, I gave my life to you
And now that life is halfway over
And I'm wonderin' how I'm gonna get over
When show money's really three O's
Can't live off a tour if its only three shows
The fans I have, they really legit
But even they say you should be bigger than this
And as I sit and watch guys who couldn't tie my J's
Blow the fuck up, while I turn old and grey
In a rockin' chair, regrettin' what might have been
If I just woulda did something different
But we have no control of the path
And Van Gogh ain't sell a painting till after he passed, alas

[Bridge: U2]
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without
I can't live
With or without you

[Verse 2]
You know I think about quittin'
But then I feel ungrateful for what I've been given
Think about all my friends who feel no pity
Cause they ain't never played a show outside they're city
So they dont understand why I feel so shitty
But I'm about to go to Africa and in Sydney
I tell them, them trips I go on
Don't change my situation, it just gets prolonged
Allows me to hold on
To something I've been chasing for so long
So long, so long to the dream now
I just need those songs
To make sure the heat and lights go on
So I go on, cause I'll admit it
I kinda understand why Viro did it
Music was all my bro had
You take that from any of us, we all go mad

[Outro]

And you give yourself away (U2)
So sad, Rest in Peace (Reef the Lost Cauze)
And you give yourself away (U2)
Viro (Reef the Lost Cauze)
And you give (U2)
Grey ? (Reef the Lost Cauze)
And you give (U2)
Old man Goletti (Reef the Lost Cauze)
And you give yourself away (U2)
All my brothers I lost (Reef the Lost Cauze)
With or without you (U2)
Im still here cause of y'all (Reef the Lost Cauze)
With or without you uh huh (U2)
But this shit is difficult (Reef the Lost Cauze)
I can't live (U2)
And I wanna stop (Reef the Lost Cauze)
With or without you (U2)

(U2 - With or Without You fading in background)

I think about all my people that never got the chances or opportunities that I got
They never got to see the places that I got to see
Never got to experience their dream, in the least bit
So the least I can do is be great-ful for what God has given me
Im not complaining y'all, Im just saying
I understand
Cause music can tear a mans soul apart, can tear a mans home apart, can tear a mans heart and mind apart
We just human like you
This is our art, this is our everything
Thats why I say to y'all now, Reef the Lost Cauze is dead
