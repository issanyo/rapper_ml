[Verse One]
I wish I could make it better but I can’t, baby
Wish I could ease the pain but I’m just a man, baby
I know you’re feeling so alone but understand, baby
I’m here until the oceans wash away the sands, baby
Life is damn crazy, we don’t know what challenges will arise
Can’t put it on your calendar
You can’t plan it, I can’t stand it
I just want to take you away from this planet
Cause it just doesn’t deserve you
It just seems to abuse, suffer, and hurt you
That’s why I could never desert you
I want to be the one who preserves you
Cause I know what you’re worth
You are the strongest person I know
Please don’t ever let go till the end of the road
But you ain’t nowhere near that
You saying you can’t make it, I don’t wanna hear that
Look in my eyes

[Hook]
(I can see the sun)
It’s gonna shine again, it’s gonna rise again, it’ll be fine again
(I can see the sun)
It’s gonna shine again, it’s gonna rise again, it’ll be fine again
(I can see the sun)
It’s gonna shine again, it’s gonna rise again, it’ll be fine again
(I can see the sun)
It’s gonna shine again, it’s gonna shine again, it’s gonna shine again

[Verse Two]
I don’t know what to say to you so I guess I’ll just get down on my knees and pray with you
I’m sorry for your loss, I’m sorry for your pain
I’m sorry that it had to go down this way
I know you’re feeling kinda lost right now
And I know you might not want to talk right now
But if you need anything please give me a ring
And it’s crazy, it feels like I’m seeing things
Cause I was just saying the same thing last week
To somebody else, this just can’t be
Life, we dropping like flies
Look into my eyes, it’s just not right
When will it stop? When will it end?
When will we realize we’re just killing our kin?
I dedicate this to all those who lost a loved one
Just hold your head cause soon the sun comes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I be ready to flip
This rap life is crazy, I be ready to quit
I put my life into this, my time, my money, my grind
I’ve lost my mind, my honey, my money, my calm
It’s funny how time just passes
I’m twenty-five, about to surpass it but still ain’t surpassed this
Hurdle, vicious cycle, vicious circle
So I’m the studio spitting verbals, hitting purple
Another show, hustling kids at the merch booth
It’s how I survive, this is just work dude
No rest for the wicked, many nights I’ve worked through
Fourteen years since I wrote my first tune
Travelling man laid up in the back of a van
Suitcase full of CDs strapped to his hands
Watching out the window waiting for the sun to shine
I’m waiting for the sun to rise, it’s gonna come one of these times

[Hook]
