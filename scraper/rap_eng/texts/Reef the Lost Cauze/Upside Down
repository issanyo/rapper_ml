[Sample]:
"Ain't no smile, no smile, no smile, no smile around town...and when I"

[Hook] [Scandal]:
I thought I had somethin' with you girl
You done turned my whole world up the fuck side down
And now I gotta hide my hard time when I lie down
I try to go asleep
I think about you
Start sweatin' in the sheets, ain't nothin' true
Son I can't believe you
What the fuck?
Fuck you, you made me leave, I ain't wanna leave you

[Verse One] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
And now that it's over, over
Feel like I weight off of my shoulder, shoulder
At least that's what I'm thinkin' when I'm sober
Then I get to drinkin', get to thinkin'
Maybe I should've handled it differently
But you knew what to do just to get to me
I guess you could say I had an epiphany
And truthfully you really wasn't meant for me
I was tryin' to talk you wasn't really gettin' me
You said some of the most disrespectful shit to me
Got mad for nothin' and startin' hittin' me
And that's when I knew I had to make an exit quickily
But now I can't breathe, it's like my heart is twistin' me
I'm already down girl and now you get to kickin' me?

[Hook] [Scandal]:
I thought I had somethin' with you girl
You done turned my whole world up the fuck side down
And now I gotta hide my hard time when I lie down
I try to go asleep
I think about you
Start sweatin' in the sheets, ain't nothin' true
Son I can't believe you
What the fuck?
Fuck you, you made me leave, I ain't wanna leave you

[Verse Two] [Eternia]:
Stop
Thinkin' about how we conceivable
Start
Thinkin' that the shit unbelievable
Go
And ? one of your peoples
Slow
The fuck down, you yell, I'mma leave you
I told you, the girl from the Bay, yep she peeped you
She told me the ways you played with her cerebral
Dumb bitch, groupie from the west coast, see through
See you, could've contracted somethin' lethal
Fuck you, I hate you for lovin' you so deeply
Gotta do what I gotta do whether you need me or not
You see me, why you deceivin'?
Cryin' cause I see you lied to me, cheatin'
So finally, we handle sides for the evening
Advise what you speakin'
Decide that you leavin' now

[Hook] [Scandal]:
I thought I had somethin' with you girl
You done turned my whole world up the fuck side down
And now I gotta hide my hard time when I lie down
I try to go asleep
I think about you
Start sweatin' in the sheets, ain't nothin' true
Son I can't believe you
What the fuck?
Fuck you, you made me leave, I ain't wanna leave you

[Verse Three] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
We came outta this as two different persons
Same conclusion with two different versions
Who's right or wrong, well both of you were hurtin'
Only human but you actin' like you perfect
When the cracks start to form, start to surface
Start to feel insecure, uncertain
Start to really question if it's worth it
And come to the conclusion that it's just not workin'
But you still stay, can't close the curtains
Venomous and resentment becomes more important
Blown out of proportion, lines distorted
The price to play and we can no longer afford it

[Hook] [Scandal]:

Fuck you, you made me leave, I ain't wanna leave you
