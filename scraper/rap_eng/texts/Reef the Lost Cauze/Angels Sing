[Verse One]
Blaze the afghan green
This black man's seen through my lazy hindsight
Get your mind right, relate to the time's like
So much pressure
Young, black, gifted measure for measure
Snakes poisoning our nectar, yet you feast from it
Drink it down and participate
In the evil ways the man want us to authenticate
Make a trademark to slave ours
You my brother I don't wanna have to blaze y'all
But motherfucker this a war zone
And soldiers we emulate
Walk a crooked line, I wonder if we'll ever get it straight
So much hate
It's like life it has no value
So many gone before they had a chance to figure out who
Or what they could've been
So many peers in my teens were left as nothing but tears
Then the mother face the stream and I swear...

[Hook]
La la la la la
Sometimes I swear I hear them angel's singing
La la la la la

[Verse Two]
It seems it will never change
Not a day's sunny
I feel it will forever rain as my brain takes me back to the day when
When I first met my nigga Graylin
Under the rail in my apartment staircases
He had the new Asics
Pass the L we started battle rapping
Niggas jumped him, he started packing
Got shot up when we was 18
It's been three years but sometimes
And I know it sounds kinda weird
I swear I hear his voice in the air
Beautiful like angel's singing
I know he's still here
And I swear...

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Niggas obsessed with death
Grand Theft Auto infatuations
When I reflect it seems I've been to more funerals than graduations
And birthday party's and weddings
So upsetting these life lessons
Niggas keep forgetting that death
It's just a blessing in disguise
So I, keep that beef alive when people die in vain
I try to explain to myself that the world we living is Hell
No Heaven above would happen to love
What happened to us
Before we know we'll be nothing but dust
It's hardest to reach through
I try to speak to my people
They think they Al Pacino and Nino, this ain't Casino
You are not Robert Deniro
What is it about a man of evil makes you call him a hero?
Zero tolerance, my man O had a scholarship to play football
But a week before he took off, his soul was shook off
When them shots took off
Wrong place, wrong time, now we in that long line
I wonder if his spirit's resting
So many questions, no answer
Why does there have to be so
Many people losing they life every time the breeze blow?
Mothers killing they daughters
Husbands killing their wives
Frozen spirits turning to clouds help to fill in the skies
For every life in the making there's one in the taking
Murdering the population
Perfect balanced equation
50/50
Life or death you choose your fate
Karma exists, remember this in every move you make
The streets will take you under quicker than a current
The rose that grew from concrete, need light to flourish
Or we'll wither away
To my niggas who are no longer with us today
I'm okay, I'm still here believing in hope
I hope you're resting even though I know I'm still seeing your ghost
