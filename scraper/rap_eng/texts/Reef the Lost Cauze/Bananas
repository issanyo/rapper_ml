[Verse One]
That's some funny shit
Y'all niggas stopping my change
Reef is number one, that's not gonna change
I hear niggas want it, well where y'all at?
Exactly, you won't get at me faggot so fall back
If it's all rap the gat won't touch you
I just stick my foot so far up ya ass
You'll be shitting my calve muscle
Don't let that funny shit fool ya
Nigga I'll school ya
Pull out the Ruger, Straight To The Heart like Luther

[Hook] {x2}
It's bananas
Wild the fuck out and just slam ya
All my buck niggas bust hammers
Cock them things back and blam blam ya
You understand us?

[Verse Two]
I'm on top dawg
Never few and far between
Then I'll chew and char your spleen with chianti and fava beans
Rhyme Hannibal
This is official fight music
My flow leave ya hoes dancing like this was civil rights movement
Ya like losing?
Ya keep talking ish like Mike before he tried Louise Lennox
If ya image is the reason, ya beating a dead horse
Ya on course to get ya motherfucking door knocked off the hinges

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Hold the phones dawg
Take a breather relax
So many ignorant ass people really believe they can rap
The fact is you need less practice and more prayer
That weak shit there? Shouldn't be allowed in a CD player
You should be banned from the booth, you people oughta be ashamed
You dudes is like twice my age we oughta be the same
But we not, see I'm hot, you're nothing close to it
I heard ya tape it sound like you compose boredom and wrote to it
You know when someone takes a crap and then throws up?
You sound like that...plus crap
What's that?
Who's the most creative innovator of rhymes sayers?
My mind layers, beats call "the insulator"
You'se a fucking hater
Like crabs in a barrel but if ya want it
I put ya eyelash to the barrel
I blast if I must
This is the era of the gladiator
Unleash hell on my signal
Same time ask God to save us
We taking everybody, every body's for the taking
You've been waiting and it's just amazing
Come out talking 'bout eating kids to a standing ovation
Applause it's The Cauze and I keep ya mind racing
I'm chasing a dream, waiting for cream
But until then keep killing and spilling devouring children
Powering and building the most talented villain
The most malicious the most twisted
Most gifted, most inventive, crime misfit ever invented
Ever rhyme sentence a relentless proof on
Who the next one to shine is
Y'all niggas ain't nothing but spineless hybrids of my shit
You can't compete
Or compare over a beat or dead air
Accapella or instrumental
Freestyle, pen or pencil, you bring the paper
Bet my life I will rape ya
Destroy ya, have your label ready to null and void ya
Nigga unemploy ya
Take ya spot, fuck ya spot
I like mine better
You can rhyme all your life
But deep down you know I'll always rhyme better
This is a signed letter to every rapper on the circuit
I'm only someone you want to work with
Never go against
Pent up aggression
Fuck up every session nigga

[Hook]
