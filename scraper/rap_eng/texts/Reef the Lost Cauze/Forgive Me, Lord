[Intro]
Dear Lord. Gotta feed the block, gotta gotta feed the block

[Verse 1]
And I know He watching over me
I know He knows I robbed them niggas that was owing me
And He know I had a ho or three blowing me
While my ex girl was on the phone with me
I hope He understands
I hope He can see that I ain't perfect, I'm just a man
But that excuse is cold fate
And I know it won't get me past them gold gates
Man I stole destiny and sold faith
Man I stole weaponry and sold eights
No homo but it's hard to go straight
When you've been living crooked since your birth date
I ain't ask to be here in the first place
I ain't know my man would snitch after that case
Little Moogie
Still behind the stone gate
A brick wall
But that was his own fate
I feel guilty like I ain't help enough
But I did all I could do that's what I tell myself
Temptation too great, it's like I can't help myself
I know the limit but it's like I gotta test myself
Go back to that? I refuse to let myself
When you ain't got cash it's hard to check yourself
Just because I don't rap about that life
It don't mean I don't know about that life
Only thing that save me was that mic
When push come to shove I push that white
Or I grab that mask and grab that purse
But I hear my niggas that pass saying "You gon' end up in a hearse"

[Hook] {x4}
"Forgive me Lord I know I ain't living right
Gotta feed the block, gotta gotta feed the block"

[Verse 2]
I gotta feed the block, my niggas need saving
Look at me and be like, "Reef you made it."
They never been to Paris, never been to Vegas
Some ain't been past the hood they was raised in
They feel trapped, yeah they feel caged in
But through rap, I take them
Even if they ain't got no plane ticket
They feel hope cause they know that they brother is the main ticket
On warm days, I visit, we sit and kick it
Geeking out at the pictures of the bitches
All of that crowd looking sickening
Jumping all crazy, repeating every word that I mention
Then they stand at attention, I can't believe it
I say, "If you see it then you can be it."
You ain't got to rob, sell dope or go cheat a nigga
Hope and power that's how I feed my niggas

[Hook]
