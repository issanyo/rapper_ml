I ain't pull up in a cake whip
I appeared in the mist, ridin' on a slave ship
Docked at James River
Where they used to hang and maim niggas
In the same picture they'd explain scriptures
Cocaine and liquor, I was born into a tenure of fitna
Drug wars for 40 years - nobody richer
I had priors before Richard, bills before Cosby
It's not comedy, I'm starving
I'm at your dance party, ice-griller
Wonderin' aloud, 'What is wrong with these white children?'
This ain't hipster rap, this that official vicious rap
By the aristocrat of rippin' cats you missin that
I figured that; the kid is back and no he didn’t slack
I’m on my job ya’ll until we get it back
Cause you hated too, until my face is blue
I raise with you and drop these coons before they labels do
I can divide, I know times tables too
I’m out to lunch check please at table two
You just a farmer, I take out your stable too
Oh, you crazy? I’m a little unstable too
It’s all good, I’m all about my paper too
But I live this shit, and this is something you get paid to do
See the difference, people listen, feel enlightened
Fuck the fame, see what the game did to Mike Tyson?
That nigga livin' in a bus station
Then they got the nerve to wonder why I'm filled with such hatred
From where the bus fare raisin' and we know how the dust tastin'
Cause guns bust on every occasion
You speak of one nation, we don't count as much
Chinamen make a thousand bucks for sellin' the same amount of Dutch
Masters to young bastards who cut classes
Tap asses, sling crack and get blasted
By someone they used to have class with
It's not tragic, it's a part of the package
Over money that coulda been replaced
I know you read the news, my dude, but in all truth, do you see a face?
The one that looks like mine and got shot nine times
And he ain't signed to Dr. Dre
And he's dead and the brother who did it locked away
This is my life, I got a lot to say
Every nigga sent here to piss you off
I ain’t doing the jigaboo strut, no sir, no Chicken George
Before that I'mma kick in doors
This is not reform out here, young boy, this is war
And if you’re not prepared, you will die violently
The real, not with rappers trying to be on channel 93
God confides in me, so I see I have no right to be anything aside from what I was designed to be
Everyday he reminded me that I’m the “lost cauze” my dog
But I didn’t decide to be
Everyday he reminded me that I’m the “lost cauze” my dog
But I didn’t decide to be
