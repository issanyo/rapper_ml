"Lost cause"
"I have mastered, every angle of this rap shit" - Reef The Lost Cauze

[Verse One]
They don't make 'em like they used to
DJ's don't break 'em like they used to
Cause payment what they used to
Same route that your favorite rap mags take
They won't give you a story unless you payin' for ad space
And video countdowns, real shit come in last place
Matter fact, you won't even see it till mad late
I miss the wop, I miss givin' the gas face
Modern day minstrel, stenciled in black face
The game's empty
That's why I remain indie
It don't matter, I'm met with the same envy
Same shit, different day
Same shit, different pay
I'mma do my thing, just in a different way
So sit amazed while I'm rippin' stage, spittin' flames
Been nice since the days of Fat Albert and Picture Page
This is gifted rage
I'm holdin' on to the art form, y'all seem eager to just give away

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Two]
I sit with lit thoughts, bumpin' Big Smalls gettin' pissed off
Thinkin' of the game and all it's pitfalls
Many get signed and ripped off but never will they get Cauze
They just don't get Cauze, so I tell 'em "Get lost"
It's the end of the gravy train, time to get off
Your man don't feel me, oh well, that's his loss
I'm not breakin' my neck or changin' my set
To appease these idiots who hear violence and sex
Acknowledge the rep
See that I won't be denied
I'd rather they ignore me for truth then know me for lies
I'm not another shoulder gipped MC
Bitching cause the industry won't let me in for free
Without an entry fee
To put it simply
I'd rather keep my own identity
And build a foundation with my extremities
My favorite begins and ends with me
Reef The Lost Cauze goin' down in history
They'll all remember me

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three]
I roll a gram and unfold a plan
Blowin' in the wind
You see pieces of a broken man
Overstand, it's gettin' money like the ocean sands
Got me feelin' so cold like a smoker's hands
In the world of hip hop, I barely know the land
I'm learning the roads, I'm ready to roll again
On my trek, got haters on my neck
But I'm too concerned about the O's on my check
I'm on my best run yet
You ain't never drop an album
I got four done, I'm on my next one yes
Hard work plus talent equals bound to blow
The keys to success homeboy, now you know
Knowledge is power, consider me muscle bound
The ones who used to talk shit is doin' nothin' now
Fuck a 9 to 5, I just hustle now
I don't bless the mic homeboy, I crush it now
