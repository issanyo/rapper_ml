[Jake Lefco]
Way back, when I had that red and black lumberjack
Stocking cap, jeans hangin off my ass
Thought I was bad, had a shaved up fade
10 karat gold bracelet with the matchin gold chain
Smokin blunts all day, frontin like I'm somethin so great
Y'all ain't got NUTTIN on me~!
My rhymes were tight, the time was right to rock
I thought I had to hide that I was white
Cause my black friends laughed when I told 'em I rapped
And my white friends asked why I wanna be black
But it wasn't that, I just didn't wanna be whack so
I copied off tracks, played the gangster rap role
It didn't last though
Cause my man caught a blast to the ass and he never came back home
Real life it's time to do that (yup)
Be an upper middle class private school grad (yup)
Be a true artist and speak from the heart
Cause even a blind man can see through a fraud
I was lost, tryin hard to be hard
Got a wake up call, said you are who you are

[Chorus]
Got it locked in a safe, you're wrong
What'chu think this is a game you can play? Come on
If you make it through the summer can't avoid the fall
Bet you think you know it all, here's your wake up call
If you think you got it locked in a safe, you're wrong
What'chu think this is a game you can play? Come on
If you make it through the summer can't avoid the fall
Bet you think you know it all, here's your wake up call

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Rememberin back when Reef was bugged
Bandana on, hammer in my pants, shorty wanna be a thug
Wasn't no love spread, all I seen was blood
Started dealin fiends the dubs, inhalin cheeba buds
Guzzlin 40 ounce, my brain leakin suds
Even tweakin dust, cops tryin to speak to us
We ain't give a fuck, thought we was invincible
What can a teacher tell you when you make more than the principal
Change came eventual, short-lived is the life of a criminal
Dawg I lost more than a friend or two
Took a clearer, look at the man in the mirror
Got wise in time not to fuck senior year up
Many of my peers didn't hear the - call
It's like the devil clogged they ears up
I was there once without shit to lose
But when the alarm went off, I didn't hit snooze

[Chorus]

[Scandal]
I set my alarm for six but didn't wake up
Had a ball the night before, more like an 8 but
Settin for a session at 7 and I was late cause
I was busy messin with chickens that wanna take drugs
And livin the high life is full of fake love
Strung out and frayed up, like my shoelace was
Was gettin paid but I wasn't no dealer
Accuse another rapper of frontin, I wasn't no realer
My reflection wasn't clear but I was lovin the mirror
For choppin and slicin lines up instead of writin rhymes up
I had a visit from my niggas, saw me stuck in the spot
If it didn't stop they wasn't fuckin with doc
And I'm glad that they spoke up, cause that's when I woke up
Dropped the coke, picked up the mic pad pen then I smoked up
This part of my life was a bitch that we broke up
A scar with no sign of a stitch but it's sewn up
I shoulda been dead or, caught a bid
But instead I'm gonna live cause of somethin they said
Hit a nigga like one in the head you done changed
Got caught by the strays like hay in a gun range
Now I'm back down to earth like planes on runways
Cause the sun even shines on a dog's ass some days

[Chorus]
