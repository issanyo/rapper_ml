[Intro: Reef talking]
Feast or fuckin' Famine. Lost Cauze. Juju Mob. Eyego D. Holla at ya boy! Holla at ya boy!

[Verse One]
Yo
The Lost Cauze is about venom
Seein' me is a wild vision
You grown man with child wisdom, I'll kill 'em
My rhymes wildin' the fuck out, y'all chillin'
You'se a small villain
Yo, pray for y'all children
Hail the all wicked
My dick look like a bald midget
And that's something that I'm proud of
My team's strong cause guns equal power
You'se a god damn coward
Your heart skip when the Cauze rip
Been nice since Kane came with the chains and the "awwww shit"
You don't remember that
Cause you'se a hip hop toddler suckin' on Similac
Now give it back
Or I'm snatchin'
I costarred in The Passion as an assassin
But they cut it at the last second
You who nicer than Reef?
No suburban nerd rapper, no guy in the street
Take your face and beat you with it
I take a nap while you rap
Wake up, make a snack, come back and eat you wit it motherfuckers

[Hook]
It's the Cauze
Throw two guns up
JuJu Mob
Throw two guns up
Counterparts Crew
Throw two guns up
Philly run shit
Throw two guns up
Eyego D
Throw two guns up
All my wild motherfuckers throw two guns up
All my wild motherfuckers throw two guns up

[Verse Two]
Fuck with me and you're gonna die
I'm the type to Short Circuit on you guys like Johnny Number 5
You disappear like Steve Gutenberg
I'm the line where madness and music merge, abusin' words
Drug addict, booze and herb, you shittin' on who?
You couldn't move a turd
Look what I do to brain cells, just think what I can do to nerves
I'm only give you what you deserve
No false idols you should serve
End up sleepin' in a bed of flames
I'm on course
A horse like Edgerrin James
Leave your head in pain
Wrapped in ace bandages
I got 31 flavors kid, get your banana split
Look at my mind, show me where the damage is
Your CD's between dirt and grass that's where I sandwiched it
Don't be surprised when I flip out on you guys like Nas
After his moms died from the cancer shit

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
My flow's sorta like the sun heat
Go to war one deep, now Throw Your joints in the air like Sonsee
Word to Papa Doc
Reef's strong like a rasta's lock
Cop a squat and listen to
How we rock your top
Mad Flava like I rock the clock
Around my neck and roll with Chuck D
You an actor with a lot of props
I'll tear your set apart
You a bench warmer who will never start
I'm cold blooded like Leather Heart
Aim sharp, hit whatever mark
With dead heat precision
It's the life of a dead beat musician
I'm no joke, who said Reef was kiddin'?
Half you MC's can't connect beat with rhythm
Unnatural spitters, I roll with actual niggas
Not posers who just be actin' official
I got a Jones like Too Tall
You couldn't move me with a U-Haul
You a bunch of faggots and goofballs
This the new laws

[Hook]

[Outro: Reef talking]
Feast or Fam motherfuckers. Another classic. Who fuckin' wanna battle me with this rap shit? Get smacked backwards. Get your whole shit beheaded son. Get your whole fortress caved in. For real. Shouts out to West Philly. My fuckin' grandma and shit. Yeah!
