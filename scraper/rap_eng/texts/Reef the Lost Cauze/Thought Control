[Intro] [Reef talking]:
Hootie hoe! Dumbhi, Dumbhi. Uh oh. Roll it, light it. We got another one. This shit right here is called Thought Control cause my thoughts are outta control you know what I'm saying? This that spazmatic rap

[Verse One]:
Rock rebel
Waste all metal
American dream without the fuckin' falsetto
I shine like Palmetto
Florida
Palm, trees in my palm
Cauze
Coroner
Pumpin' Pat Benatar, I am the Warrior
You might beat me, if there was more to ya
This that new knots, stacks in my shoe box
Legendary
John Henry ridin' a blue ox
Jibstars on my tube socks
You're a nobody
Who's you and who's not?
You chew cock til your tooth rot
I'm so sick like puke snot
I'm 2Pac meets Chewbac
Jaguar, bound to blow like a bad tire
Even Omar died on the last Wire
I'm beyond fire
The Cauze brings you Sounds Of Blackness just like a black choir

[Hook]:
"We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control"
That's what the people sayin'
"We don't need no education"
That's what the people sayin'
"We don't need no thought control"

[Verse Two]:
Ayo hip hop
Home of the gayest kids
Drake ass look like a fake ass Jason Kidd
Save the game like my name was ?
We a weak fucker, sheep fucker that lay with pigs
You get the snout face
Yeah we trap about to eat the same cheese that the mouse ate
Let your mouth make threats
Yet
You see me out late
And your bitch ass do an about face
I ask
"What's a garden without snakes?"
Unreal, like a ? without hate
You funny like an outtake
Keep a monkey on my back like Outbreak
Dumhi make the house quake
Fish fry make the trout bake
Rap is phoney, see who they can out fake
Old man mental, with a child face
You say your flow is how great?
Don't worry I'll wait

[Hook]:
"We don't need no education"
Yo, I learn everything from drugs I take
Drugs I took, I'm high get the fuck out my face
"We don't need no thought control"
Ayo you can't control me, I won't let you
I don't even know you, I don't respect you
"We don't need no education"
Cause I'm too smart for that shit
I'm in the fuckin' crib, workin' on rhymes smokin' backwoods
"Teacher leave them kids alone"
Yo, you can't control me can't control them
I just say shit
"Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!
All in all, it's just a
Nother brick in the wall
All in all, it's just a
Nother brick in the wall
All in all, it's just a
Nother brick in the wall
All in all, it's just a
Nother brick in the wall"
