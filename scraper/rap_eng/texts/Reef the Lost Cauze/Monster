[Verse One: King Magnetic]
Newest reason you should lock your door
More knock outs than Rocky 4
Gun got me cocky more
Used to wild now I'm lower than a hockey score
You're not raw, that's a front more than papi's store
Get sucker punched trying to watch your step
Think you're sweet? Heat melt through your chocolate chest
Weed help [?] stress
I'll Spock ya neck
The hottest MC that wasn't shot to death
Let go of that bullshit brother
Before I convert from covert and full clip dump ya
Slump a dude like bad posture
Mag's a monster
Drag and stomp ya
Everybody tough till I run up in they concert
Do a bid, go broke, rob a nigga, then I pump like a Mausberg
It's A Vicious Cycle, without the Reef album
Oral surgeon, knock him out, knock some teeth out him
It's my last shot
Don't want to shoot nobody
I wasn't planning on it
It ain't my planet, I just landed on it
Stand enormous as the Island I was stranded on it
Wasn't eatin' so I jammed him for it
Now a days, middle age is 13 or so
I stay smoked out so others don't seem as slow
Raise six shooters, but not six year olds
Rats didn't have to snitch, half the shit the pictures show

[Verse Two: Reef The Lost Cauze]
Ayo, me plus a mic equal damage do the math son
I fuck up more little white kids than Michael Jackson
It's a wrap son
I don't know why you workin' on a new record
Nobody copped the last one
You in the past son
I'm on to bigger things
This ain't the league for me
He's onto bigger rings
A nigga brings his best every rhyme
No change, still drops jewels with every shinin'
Inventive with every rhyme, bring life to the track
Write raps with a knife in my back, I like it like that
Inspires greatness, mind state in higher places
Find my placement where ever the state of grace is
Guard will gate it
Heart is jaded
Took my hatred for the game and turn my hand into aces
Many faces get burned into pavement
