(Olly Olly Oxen Free)
Two tone rebel never leave scraps on the table when there's food left
(Olly Olly Oxen Free)
I rely on myself in the work that I carry in my tool chest
(Olly Olly Oxen Free)
Who runs? Who hides? Who lives? Who dies? In this fool's quest
(Olly Olly Oxen Free)
And I'll be damned if I let myself trip from a lesser man's ledge

[Verse 1: E-dubble]
Early in the morning, barely got my eyes up
Take two steps forward pull the blinds up
Trying to see if this world made its mind up
Wise up, no chance, catch me with them blinders
Bring the bass back, like I run the base path
Pull me back up in the game I got an ace bandage
'88 choc milk with that egg sandwich
Can't play a player when it play with the mazes
They need a fall guy, low man, totem pole
Big girl tried to honeypot the yoga pose
Big deal I can wait out all the rope-a-dopes
Only deal with greens so you never catch me overdose
(Uh-huh)
See they barking up the wrong tree
Off-key singing like they think that they just bought me
(Uh)
But you can never buy me
Soundproof truth that my people are behind me

[Verse 2: Reef the Lost Cauze]
If they not their own man, I don't fuck with 'em
'Cause can't nobody hold me down, like puffing 'em
In this game, you know I got the toughest skin
I was told you can't break what doesn't bend
I'm in love with sin, I be wiling cuz
Had a tree sprayed with raid because my style is above
Yeah my style is love, my style is get-get it
I reside at the top, you will never visit
You can never kick it - where the winners are
They talk tough, we roll up and they be bitching hard
We just laugh at 'em, it's simple mathematics
I keep a blade on me, go and take a stab at it
I be in a cut, I'm all about the bucks
Did he have a face? Well then it wasn't us
On that bias shit
You can't deny this shit
E-dub and Reef drugs, we supply the hit
