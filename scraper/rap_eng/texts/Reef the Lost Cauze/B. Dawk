[Intro: Brian Dawkins giving a passionate speech to his team]
What are you gonna bring to the dog gone journey? Are you gonna bust somebody in they mouth...or are you gonna do your dog gone job? Are you gonna play from your dog gone chest? Or are you gonna play from your heart and give everything you dog gone got? Cause I'mma do that. And I'mma give y'all everything I dog gone got on every play. I need everything you got tonight. There ain't no dog gone tomorrow fellas

[Verse One]
Amazement
Dumhi rocking ages
It's a cold day in Hell, my hoodie stays zipped
30 years young, face ageless
The Mind Plays Tricks like Bushwick Bill punching the pavement
This is me, I never try and pretend
Cause I came up where in battles niggas died at the end (like for real)
The fuck you in your room rapping to?
With a camera at your desk like you work for Action News
Piece of cloth, different seam I am cut from
You a sucker without one gun and that is a conundrum
If you don't know what that means, and a dumb dumbs
In the language of God it means you fucked up son
Hating on me, that just ain't gonna work
Cause you in a rap group that don't make a cent off the merch
Damn, I know that shit's gotta hurt
You life is in shambles you must feel like a jerk
Your live show is trash, you need to rehearse
Your career's a dead end, you need to reverse
Living at your mama's searching for cheese in her purse
Sitting by the phone praying that you get needed for work
I won't even call your name out
By the way it's a shame, your solo record never came out
Cause yeah
May you suffer in silence
The next time you see me pussy expect violence

[Hook] {x2}
Yeah you know the street talks
So it'll be no white flags and no peace talk
Put him in the ocean like sea salt
Philly legend hitting hard call me B. Dawk, B. Dawk, B. Dawk

[Verse Two]
Ayo I'm B. Dawk, I'm the one that pop it off
While y'all stay dropping the ball like [?]
I'ma put your frame in a hurricane off the wall
I'm here to refinish 'em by this image I'm appalled
Last album, 30K made before a bar
Just wrote Snowgoons made Chuck buy the farm
So I'm somewhere calm, my son hand in my palm
Praying that Allah protect and keep me from harm
But just in case
He don't heed my requests
The pistol is kept under the Mitchel and Ness
Hoodie, listen I will leave you with death
Let 'em lullaby you to sleep in your own bassinet
Am I the best?
That's for you to decide
But as far as Philly I'm top five dead or alive
And that is not up for debate
Cause my discography can be described as nothing but great
I do this for my own, I do this on my own
I'm B. Dawk, I'm Randall, I'm Reggiem I'm Jerome (rest in peace)
Coat type with chrome pipe leave your dome like
The sun reflecting holes in your flesh like a strobe light
I did this shit my whole life
They want that new Reef/Dumhi shit, tell 'em hold tight
Legends in our own right
Hip hop like this don't exist no more and that's the shit I don't like

[Hook]

[Outro: Reef talking]
Yeah, B. Dawk. The last line of defense. I'm the motherfucker that's gonna hit you first nigga. Dumhi/Lost Cauze. Another one
