[Verse One] [King Magnetic]:
I stick out like a pistol on a skinny person
When it’s urgent get punched more times than Vinnie verses
I’m a problem from the product to the paperwork
Slave deal make it work, main concern is making earnings
Got a great attorney, got me in the streets now
Ultramagnetic
Critical Beatdown
Invincible beast now
Invisible beat burst, street slang, feet first
Teeth marks Reef’s merch
It’s enticing reversal, the type that’ll burst you
The rifle will Earth you, put a knife in your hurdle
Pipe in your girdle, I’ll stick the fucking mic in the fertile
Keep it a secret until she sneak the creeping immortal
In order to keep me you outta, read the disorder
At least we can afford the quarter of the reefer they brought us
Give me a warrant so your image won’t last long
You suspect like armed robbers with no mask on

[Hook]:
Anyone above us, time to plummet now
Cause we always sound hungry as a stomach growl
While you run your mouth, my nigga’s run it now
Till our verses is fucking up your budget now

[Verse Two] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
I’m a serious beast, you’re a delirious queef
The bacteria found in traces of period yeast
Seriously, fear is envy
You’re frail and you sell fairy tales like a mirror that’s me
Who’s the fairest? I bought you niggas, who’s your parents?
You repeat what your boss say, you’s the parrot
God bless all the fools who perish
Trying to remove the cherished kids who lose the spirit
Lift you like air lifts, I’m in tune with spiritual damage, you ?
Stop it, stab em, pop it, tag em, drop em, I track em
And snatch em in flat lands, they’ll find your fat hands
Stashed inside of a fucking trash can
Niggas stink like Pepe Le Pew, especially you
Me and Mag reppin' for Stoupe
I’m next to get due so to respect me is due
Dawg I shot the sheriff and the deputy too

[Hook]:
Anyone above us, time to plummet now
Cause we always sound hungry as a stomach growl
While you run your mouth, my nigga’s run it now
Till our verses is fucking up your budget now
Anyone above us, time to plummet now
Cause we always sound hungry as a stomach growl
While you run your mouth, my nigga’s run it now
Till our verses is fucking up your budget now

[Verse Three] [Reef The Lost Cauze]:
I am felt from Philly to the Bible Belt
A champion who smoke weed like Michael Phelps
If my words don’t do it then my rifle help
You nice and all that homie but don’t hype yourself
Thinking you can creep in and just swipe the belt
Don’t blame God, you ain’t strike yourself
Catch a hook like a new chorus
It’s not about what the music does for you
What can you do for it?

[King Magnetic]:
I quit Newports, I borrow a cig now
The same caliber of the shit that’s a big now
Beast that’s compared to deceased in they region
Get open with a stick like my blinds Venetian
Crimes is recent, the rhymes I’m leasing
Define my reason I’m squeezing the nine, police em
Didn’t think you'd be an artist soon, I call this tune
"Cop King And The Cauze In June"

[Hook]:
Anyone above us, time to plummet now
Cause we always sound hungry as a stomach growl
While you run your mouth, my nigga’s run it now
Till our verses is fucking up your budget now
