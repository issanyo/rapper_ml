[Verse One]
I make you a believer
Split your house in a half
Bring you Danger and Doom without a mouse or a mask
What I need in life? An ounce or a flask
It's the Cauze, don't make me put your mouth in your ass
Talk shit? You will eat that
If I wanted feedback
I would've simply asked you, "Yo, where's the weed at?"
I leave you stubborn like the drums underneath me
I can't hear you screaming if you so underneath me
Fuck with Reef be
Abby's first born
I'll leave you looking like the [?]
You know the aftermath
Don't need jumping in attach ya ass
You better than me? My label's Aftermath
An Eminem's a nigga from Philly
I don't fear another man, I'm a nigga from Philly
That means I'm supposed to die soon
But I won't cause I defy fools
With my mystic mind tools
Psych nah, I'm behind you
And a nine too
Leon with the Peon will drive off when it's time to
Who wouldn't find you?
Ask Magnetic?
I replied, "Fuck him, give me three more beats on credit."
Inside joke
I'm not fire, I'm the fumes that exist inside smoke
That ain't good weed, that's 'I hope I get high smoke'
I'm known for beautiful bitches and foul quotes
You little cow poke
I'm Apache
Bring the beef to the cow show, now how dope
Is the kid from the 'Delph?
If I gave you more you'd probably shit on yourself
I don't sell "weed"
Crack or pop toasters what's in my holsters
Enough ammo to take over pop culture
You high, "No sir"
Lost Cauze the spot blower
Game over
