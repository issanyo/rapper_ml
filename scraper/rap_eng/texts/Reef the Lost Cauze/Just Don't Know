[Sample]
"Now I just don't know"

[Verse One: Blacastan]
I'm up early in the morning with no plans to go to school
Twist up an L and cop an Olde English 22
Couple of loosies, my man Holla deuce me
Now And Laters, bag of chips, quarter water juice B
Criminal route, middle school drop out
Give me your undivided, so I can tell you what it's 'bout
No food in the fridge, no pops in the house
Throw Illmatic in the tape deck and zone out
Simpler times, petty crimes, nickles and dimes
Same niggas that you run with will stick you for shines
And probably around the way like Guru said
Send kites to your older brother holdin' his head
Up north, fucked around, blew trial and court
Bummy, no child support, foul style of course
Ran the streets in the golden era
I know real rap
A baby in the 80's when niggas sold real crack

[Hook]
"Now I just don't know"

[Verse Two]
I'm more conscious of my health, watching what I eat now
Brown rice with the bean sprouts, I'm tofu'd out
Yo, my niggas say I'm buggin', I'm just tryin' to live cousin
Switched up the diet, shedding pounds like nothing
Calisthenic money plus cardiovascular
Cross training on the bike feeling spectacular
Blood flowing, heart pumping, hour and a half
Hit the pad then I work out with the pen and the pad
Keep the mind sharp, book reading, 48 Laws shit
History channel, flat panel, feeding my conscious
No longer shootin' the breeze with niggas 'bout nonsense
Took too many years to grow up this much
'9-6, blowing dust, not givin' a fuck
I had to man up and change direction, change perception
Been married, got divorced, I loved and I lost
On a journey through life tryin' to find my course

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Reef The Lost Cauze]
I'm damn near 30
Yeah it's time to stop coasting
Trying to fall back some, time to stop smoking
Trying to take my bull by the horns and stop hoping
I might crack a smile but homie I'm not joking
My life 'bout to change for the better it seems
And that don't necessarily mean cheddar and cream
It mean, good health and sleep at night
I'm starting to see the light, it's about peace in life
And I, damn near missed the point
Spending all my time doing shows and writing joints
I still do it
But now I put me first and then music
So if I don't hit you back right away, don't take offense to it
It just means that I'm takin' a break
Never a flake, I'm a human that learn from mistakes
Cause that what make you a man
Understand like my fam Blacastan
This is the plan, nahI'msayin'?

[Hook]
