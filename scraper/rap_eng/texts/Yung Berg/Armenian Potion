Plus I gotta thank my competition for not existing

[Hook]

She wanna F me in the Phantom, but I hardly let her
Dough and my cheese so C … Got me coughing cheddar
They on my grind Ho, but I will get it off never
Niggas act like Velcro, when they be soft as leather
In my Mercedes-Benz, more like my latest skin
Bad bitch deep diving in the latest trends
We do a hundred in something private she can taste the wind
