[Verse 1]
I got it gridlocked, 2 Pac
3 shots, Let it sink in
Hot ride outside
Four door, chauffeur driven
Here
I've got more to lose than you
Uuh uuh
Three o'clock in the morning
Y'all be on that other shit, but I ain't on it
Tryina give me your advice, but I don't want it
I've got things to do
Phone ring, I call em later
Just dissed this nigga for my vibrator
Hope you ain't in trouble
Cause I can't save you
No, no no no no oh

[Hook ]
So, put it on my nightstand, baby
Can you keep it right there baby?
Got it on my nightstand, baby
Excuse me, These won't just save me
Baby, please excuse my behavior
But can I get back the fucks that I gave you?
Tryna mellow out, I need to blaze up
Can't wait to get my back to my nightstand

Right here, on my left
Out and rollin'

Hey yeah yeah
Tell me why I can't feel it no more?
Most of y'all niggas can't afford sleeping in my bed
Oh, ooh
