[Verse 1]
Say hey baby
(Hey baby)
Yo baby
(Yo baby)
I've been tryin' to keep my eyes off you
But everybody knows I'm feeling you
Yeah baby
(Yeah baby)
Yo baby
(Yo baby)
From the way that you walk, the way you move
Damn ya cute, tubes, designer shoes
(Girl you a star from)
Head to toe
(Thought I'd be the first to)
Let you know
Forget about traveling across the globe
(I will take you, I will take you)
(Come and swear)
Girl, right away
(You gon' be up)
Night to day
Took her to the shop, people stormin' out
(Ay, so what you sayin'?)

[Chorus]
We about to seek off so slip off your shoes
And
(Put your Louis luggage in of a red Benz)
You gon' feel it when we take off, feel it when we movin'
Feel it when we touch, girl you know what we doin'

[Hook]
I'm gonna take you outerspace
I'm gonna take you outerspace
I'm gonna take you outerspace
(I will take you, I will take you)
I'm gonna take you outerspace
I'm gonna take you outerspace
I'm gonna take you outerspace

[Verse 2]
So hey baby
(Hey baby)
Yo baby
(Yo baby)
Girl the way you puttin' it down on me
Feels like we're in a new galaxy
Yeah baby
(Yeah baby)
Yo baby
(Yo baby)
I just wanna get one and you get three
So baby won't you come to me
(Start off fast)
Then take it slow
(Right there girl)
And there it go
Girl, baby
(Come and swear)
Girl, right away
(You gon' be up)
Night to day
Took her to the shop, people stormin' out
(Ay, so what you sayin'?)

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We about to seek off so slip off your shoes
And
Put your Louis luggage in of a red Benz
You gon' feel it when we take off, feel it when we movin'
Feel it when we touch, girl you know what we doin'

[Hook]

[Outro]
(You)

This is for the radio

(You)

See it's all about you, girl everything you do
So I ain't satisfied till I'm up inside of you
I wanna see your bed break
Baby girl, I wanna see your legs shake
When I'm inside of you
