Turn my mic lever up
Check
There you go
Danger
Clutch

My heart got broken
And my chest been hurting
What I need is a personal prescriptional killer
(Painkiller)
Can't sleep
Even make it out of bed
Take my temperature

Mista put ya hand
Across my head
You got me hot for ya
You give me relief
It must have been your vitamin C

Doctor's orders
One glass of water
One dose of you
And call me in the morning

[Chorus]
Doctor, doctor
Hurry quick
Fix me, fix me
I'mma love sick

Diagnose me red roses
And time not to notice
All of those things I want
Help me, help me
Say you will
Be the pill, for my ills

See, I'm so sick
Make it better, better, baby
Say you will, ah
Please baby, be my painkiller
See, I'm so sick
Make it better better, baby
Say you will, ah
Please baby, be my painkiller

I need the best IX
No side affects
Hit the next pharmacy
See if they got some left
Diagnosed with a case of heartburn

Doctor, will you ever get me
When you gonna learn
I know I'm hot-headed
It's so good to me
But you got the medicine I need

Doctor's orders
One glass of water
One dose of you
And call me in the morning

[Chorus]
I got, I got, I got
(I got this pain in my chest)
I can't I can't I can't
(Would you look at me I'ma mess)
You got it, you got it, you got it
(Ohhh you got it)
To be, to be, to be
(Ohh you affected me)

I can't get you off my mind
(No, I can't get you off my mind)
I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
(I can't get you off my mind)
Ooh, huh huh huh huh huh huh huh
Ooh, huh huh huh huh huh huh huh

Help me, baby)

[Chorus]

Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh
