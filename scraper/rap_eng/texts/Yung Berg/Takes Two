[Verse 1: K. Michelle]
Got the Rolls Royce, mansion with the big gate
With a superstar, every day make a movie
They tell me 'bout you but ain't nothin' they can tell me
Married to the game, for you I'll catch your bouquet!
Only use a Maybach for the foreplay
This another 12 Play, baby this a heavy plate
You an angel, have you fly you out to LA

[Bridge 1: K. Michelle]
I know you wanna see me, no, I ain't gon' dodge ya
On top, pop my pussy like I pop my collar
Naked in the kitchen while I'm cookin' collards
I'mma bring my best friend, let her kiss all on ya!

[Chorus: K. Michelle]
(Ain't no fun if it ain't) two-o-o-o-o-o-o
(For real, you got that) o-o-o-o-o-o-o-u
(Shine like my diamonds, drippin') we-e-e-e-e-e-e-t
(All over my) swe-e-e-e-e-e-eat!

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
You don't have to move, let me demonstrate, yeah
I'mma put that pussy on my dinner plate, yeah
Don't you pump fake way too quick to entertain ya
Got two friends, yeah, one more make it four-play, yeah!
I got plans for you tonight, yeah
I'mma light that pussy on fire
Drill, drill on my face
I like how that taste
How much can you take?
How much can you take?

[Bridge 2: K. Michelle]
Sometimes I wanna fuck, sometimes I wanna love ya
Somteimes I need a bae, sometimes I need a thugga
Naked in the kitchen while I'm cookin' collards
I'mma bring my best friend, let her lick all on ya!

[Chorus: Jeremih (K. Michelle)]
(Ain't no fun if it ain't) two-o-o-o-o-o-o
(For real, you got that) pu-u-u-u-u-u-ull
(Shine like my diamonds, drippin') we-e-e-e-e-e-et
(All over my) swe-e-e-e-e-e-eat!

[Verse 3: Jeremih (K. Michelle)]
Oooooooo!
Got the Rolls Royce, mansion with a big gate
With a superstar, yeah, every day we make a movie (O-ohh)
They tell me 'bout you, but ain't nothin' they can tell me
(Married to the game, for you I'll catch your bouquet!)
Only use a Maybach for the foreplay
(This another 12 Play, baby, this a heavy plate
You an angel, have  to fly you out to LA)

[Bridge 3: K. Michelle]
Sometimes I wanna fuck, sometimes I wanna love ya
Somteimes I need a bae, sometimes I need a thugga
Naked in the kitchen while I'm cookin' collards
I'mma bring my best friend, let her lick all on ya!

[Chorus: K. Michelle (Jeremih)]
(Ain't no fun if it ain't) two-o-o-o-o-o-o (Twooo!)
(For real, you got that) o-o-o-o-o-o-o
