(feat. Amerie)

Listen I know we been through our
Ups and downs but you cheated and broke
My heart I gave you a second chance
But you never gave up so... well I'm going
To sing to ya to get you to understand
Baby listen up it's sad news

Ooooh! Yeah

[Sigh's]

I love ya but I'm sorry I just (ooh)
Gotta let ya go baby listen

Baby listen!

[Hook:]
Look but baby stop cryin' I know it's hard
But what you did to me really broke my heart
And babe I know your sorry and I forgive you
But we just gotta just be friends so don't act
Like you don't know so ya know what
I'm bout to do (oooh)

[Verse]
This has to be the hardest thang I ever done
Desbite all the ups and downs our love was fun
But you cheated on me like twice and it made me cry
So I think it's time to say goodbye

[Hook:]
Look but baby stop cryin' I know it's hard
But what you did to me really broke my heart
And babe I know your sorry and I forgive you
But we just gotta just be friends so don't act
Like you don't know so ya know what
I'm bout to do (oooh)

[Chorus:]
Baby I gotta let you go, cause I can't
Be with you nomore baby I know your heart
Is breaking but how you think I feel
You cheated on me felt like as if my heart
Was killed baby I'm sorry but...

(Gotta let you go) and it wasn't from you
Not loving me good it's just you cheated on me
Like I wasn't the one baby I loved you so I gotta
Give you up what I'm tryna say is I...
(Gotta let you go)

{Gotta... Let You Go Listen! }

[Bridge:]
Walkin' in school hopin' to catch up with you
Saw you with another dude got me wonna hit you
But that's not a man thing to do and I ain't gon hurt you
But say it's through but I'm a sing it to you baby

{Cause! }

[Chorus:]
Baby I gotta let you go, cause I can't
Be with you nomore baby I know your heart
Is breaking but how you think I feel
You cheated on me felt like as if my heart
Was killed baby I'm sorry but...

(Gotta let you go) and it wasn't from you
Not loving me good it's just you cheated on me
Like I wasn't the one baby I loved you so I gotta
Give you up what I'm tryna say is I...
(Gotta let you go)

{Gotta... Let You Go Listen! }

[BreakDown:]
Baby I thought our love would grow
But you cheated on me so I gotta let you know
That it's over so I gotta let you go

(Gotta let you go)

Baby when I was there you never
Really acted that you cared but I was
Surprised that a kiss was the only thing we shared

{Gotta Let You Go}

[Music Stops For A Breif Mintue]

Oooooh, Yeah Uuuum

Put ya hands up in the air if ya had
Someone you loved but they never
