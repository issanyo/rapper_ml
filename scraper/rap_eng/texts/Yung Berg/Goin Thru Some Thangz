[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hol' up
Sound!

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm)

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I don't like it when they be doing you dirty
4 A.M., she textin' like, "Hit me, it's urgent"
Got her at work but don't got no work, yeah
She need bandz, she 'bout her first
She make 'em lose it whenever she get in that stance
She got dreams of islands and ridin' first class
She got a mouth on her, she kiss on her man
To get on her knees and do somethin' with no hands, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Ass too big, I'm on my toes, uh
The bra with that string don't fit on her
Can't walk pass a nigga with that
Damn, looking back over the shoulders

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm)
Goin' through some thangz, some thangz

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Late night, gone off that late night drip
Late night thoughts, might need to make that switch
You know your nigga ain't shit (Woah)
Late night Dolla give you late night dick (Woah)
1-800 Dolla $ign, give you what you like
Leave your nigga, leave your nigga, he is not your type
Only I can get you what you need
All night, all night, all night, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Ass too big, I'm on my toes
The bra with that string don't fit on her
Can't walk pass a nigga with that
Looking back over my shoulders

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Thangz)
She goin' through some thangz (Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm)
Goin' through some thangz
