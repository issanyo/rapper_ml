[Intro]
Woah
(Hello? Who is this?)
Hitmaka
Sound
(Wait, you actually remembered my number)
Sound

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm wasted
How could I get your number right?
How could I get your number right?
Right, I just wanna taste it, let me slip inside
You know I'm in the 305, all night

[Verse 1]
You know I'ma need you to just sing to my mic, right now
Turn your drip into my drain, turn these bright lights down
I don't wanna sound like I'm evil, but I'm coming for that weed too (skrrt)
Thought I was done after round 1, but you know I'ma need 2

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, stop playing
I'm not gassing out this plane
Let me fuck you in that Wraith
I got big bills in my bank
Oh my God, stop playing
I might fuck on you all day
Eat that pussy with whipped cream, let you lick it off my face

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm wasted
How could I get your number right?
How could I get your number right?
Baby, I'm wasted
How could I get your number right?
How could I get your number right?
Right, I just wanna taste it, let me slip inside
You know I'm in the 305, all night
Baby, I'm wasted
How could I get your number right?
How could I get your number right?

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
There's not anything that I'd rather do
Then to leave the club and go home with you
What's that? Just might, good pipe, good night
Wake up, sunrise, best life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my God, stop playing
I'm not gassing out this plane
Let me fuck you in that Wraith
I got big bills in my bank
Oh my God, stop playing
I might fuck on you all day
Eat that pussy with whipped cream, let you lick it off my face

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm wasted
How could I get your number right?
How could I get your number right?
Baby, I'm wasted
How could I get your number right?
How could I get your number right?
Right, I just wanna taste it, let me slip inside
You know I'm in the 305, all night
Baby, I'm wasted
How could I get your number right?
How could I get your number right?
