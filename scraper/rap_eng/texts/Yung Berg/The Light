[Intro]
Hol' up!
Hitmaka!

[Refrain: Ty Dolla $ign & Jeremih]
Let's have sex, but not without the foreplay (Okay, cool)
But not without the first date (Okay, cool)
But not before I have to wonder if you let me hit
If I walk you to your doorway
Let's have sex, but not without the sprees babe (Okay, cool)
Not without the vacays, no (Aye)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Ooh, it's the way it goes
Now don't this feel right (Don't this feel right)
I'm tryna put you in the light (Tryna put you in the light)
Ooh, it's the way it goes
I don't say goodnight (Don't say goodnight)
I'm tryna fuck you on sight (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse: Jeremih]
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But these days I'm thinkin' baby we should fuck again
I'm tryna meet you in Vegas and try my luck again
All your friends say you ain't really in love with him (dope)
Started off the Henn', now I'm off the 'Tr√≥n
Had to switch it up, I had to hit your phone
Can you picture us posted on the wall?
Can you picture us posted on the wall?
I put her to sleep and she woke up like that
Breakfast in bed, I hold her up for a snack (yeah)
Get to the back, I'm talkin' the big payback
Roll my 'wood then give her good

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Ooh, it's the way it goes
Now don't this feel right (Don't this feel right)
I'm tryna put you in the light (Tryna put you in the light)
Ooh, it's the way it goes
I don't say goodnight (Don't say goodnight)
I'm tryna fuck you on sight (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Refrain: Ty Dolla $ign & Jeremih]
Let's have sex, but not without the foreplay (Okay, cool)
But not without the first date (Okay, cool)
But not before I have to wonder if you let me hit
If I walk you to your doorway
Let's have sex, but not without the sprees babe (Okay, cool)
Not without the vacays, no (Aye)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Ooh, it's the way it goes
Now don't this feel right (Don't this feel right)
I'm tryna put you in the light (Tryna put you in the light)
Ooh, it's the way it goes
I don't say goodnight (Don't say goodnight)
I'm tryna fuck you on sight (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro: Jeremih]
Ooh, ooh (Facts)
Don't this feel right
Tryna put you in the light
