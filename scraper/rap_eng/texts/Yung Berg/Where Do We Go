Now, now, I'm a old G in the city and ya knew one day

A nigga was gon' come along and spit that real shit

Wanna be ballers out here to deal with

(Take it all, you need me)

Do her like I could do her, get it how you got to get it

Just stacking the money up to the ceiling

Ain't no penicillin finna hit 'em

When I'm dealing wit 'em ask Yung Berg

Where we go after we kill 'em?

'Cuz we gettin' money and the roof gon' be so wicked

Is the reason we can kick it how we kick

And it's the reason why we pull up on the 30's

(Take it all, you need me)

And the Hummers and we don't give a fuck

If we get a ticket and

Why I pay a hundred dollars for a watch?

Five fifty for a ounce a kush, three fifty for a pair of jeans

And thirty thousand for a Charger

(Take it all, you need me)

Two hundred for all cops on the first look

Got money on the books

And we got the dollars for Impalers

And the Thumpers and the Hummers

And I'm throwing out the other figgas
