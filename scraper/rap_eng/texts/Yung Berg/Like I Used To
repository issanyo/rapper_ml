[Intro]
Got it on smash
Hitmaka!
Yeah

[Chorus]
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah
Wake up in the morning
I can't fuck you like I used to, yeah
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah
Lay my top back, throw my problems out my new coupe

[Verse 1]
I know everything, but they don't
I've been on a wave they ain't on, no
Swerving lane to lane and it's paid for
I murder everything, nigga, case closed, yeah
Bitch I got my own cash, I do what I want to
I might do the whole dash, drive it like I want to
This shit too easy like a free throw, yeah
This shit might blow up like some C-4, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to let go
I'm in my bag bro
If it ain't about the cash flow
I'm sorry, gotta pass on
I gotta pass on you

[Chorus]
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah
Wake up in the morning
I can't fuck you like I used to, yeah
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah
Lay my top back, throw my problems on my new coupe

[Verse 2]
Ridin' down Hollywood I'm cruisin' (cruisin')
Can't be stagnant, gotta keep it movin' (movin')
I gave up all my love but you abused it (abused it, ooh)
Now you're just something I checked off my to-do list
Yeah you got your own bag, that ain't why I want you
I can pop my own tags, I can buy my own coupe
This shit too easy like a free throw, yeah
This shit might blow up like some C-4, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to let go
I'm in my bag bro
If it ain't about the cash flow
I'm sorry, gotta pass on
I gotta pass on you, yeah (pass on you, no, oh)

[Chorus]
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to (oh, like I used to, no)
Wake up in the morning
I can't fuck you like I used to, yeah (like I used to)
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah (never be the same, no, no)
Lay my top back, throw my problems on my new coupe

[Outro]
I had to let go
Never touch you like I used to
I gotta pass on you
Oh, never be the same
It's such a shame
