Montana

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
I know you want my free time
I normally don't play that, that, that, that
I'm walkin' on a thin line
I'm hopin' that it break, break, break, break, break
I'm tryna give you FaceTime (yeah)
Don't mean you wanna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I want a better bassline, I want a better bassline

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
Don't be fakin', fakin', no, yeah
Say you lookin' for someone that'll last
I know you lookin' for someone that'll last

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You want some me so bad
You want some me so bad
Come get this body
You want some me so bad
You want some me so bad
Come get this body now

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla Sign]
(Ooh Yeah)
Runnin' out of words to say
No talkin', girl, I came to play
Drop top, jump in the Wraith
Yeah, yeah
I want it face down, ass up
Turn around, let me lay down
I know you want another round, let me taste that
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't be fakin', fakin', no (no)
Say you lookin' for someone that'll last (woah)
I know you lookin' for someone that'll last
(Someone that'll last)

[Chorus: Tinashe & Ty Dolla $ign]
You want some me so bad (you so bad)
You want some me so bad (me so bad)
(You know I'm on my way, girl)
Come get this body
(Ooh, woo-ooh)
You want some me so bad
You want some me so bad (so bad)
Come get this body now

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Señorita, se-señorita
Sh-Shorty give me head like a mind reader
Overseas, sayin' why there's no rain checks
Once I showed her the safe
She ain't want no safe sex
AOD with the rain jacket
She a savage, Louis vintage baggage
You know we the flyest that's a fact
And I need a new crib for the plaques

[Bridge: Tinashe, French Montana & Ty Dolla $ign]
Quit all that stallin' (Montana!)
I got what you need right now
And I want to feel it
Tryna take you higher than the ceilin', yeah
Quit all that stallin', got what you need right now
Yeah, I want to feel it
Oh you got me caught up in my feelin's, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
Don't be fakin', fakin', no (yeah)
Say you lookin' for someone that'll last
I know you lookin' for someone that'll last

[Chorus: Tinashe & Ty Dolla $ign]
You want some me so bad
You want some me so bad (you know I'm on my way boy)
Come get this body (ooh)
You want some me so bad (me so bad)
You want some me so bad (so bad)
Come get this body
