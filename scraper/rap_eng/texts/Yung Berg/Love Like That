[Intro]
You
You, you, you
You, you, you

[Verse 1: Jason Derülo]
Okay, okay, it's my birthday, everyone left
Roleplay, we could stop the role play, everyone left
I'm making love to his girl, but he's still my nigga
No, we can't control ourselves when we on that liquor

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derülo]
Can't look the homie in his eyes 'cause I'm in love with his girl
What are we doing?

[Chorus: Jason Derülo & K. Michelle]
We ain't supposed to love like that
(We ain't supposed to love like that)
Damn, why do I feel good doing something so bad? Woah, oh
(We ain't supposed to love like that)
Oh, no, no we ain't supposed to love like that

[Verse 2: K. Michelle & Jason Derulo]
Okay (okay), it just hit 3:30, he ain't home yet
Okay, I might do some things that I'm gon' regret
(I might regret, yeah)
He don't treat me right, but he's still my nigga, somehow
We can't control ourselves 'cause we on that liquor, right now

[Pre-Chorus: K. Michelle & Jason Derulo]
Can't look my man in his eyes 'cause I'm in love with his boy (oh Lord)
What are we doing?

[Chorus: Jason Derülo & K. Michelle]
We ain't supposed to love like that, no way, no way
(We ain't supposed to love like that), no way, no way, no way
Why do I feel good doing something so bad? Oh no, oh no, no
(We ain't supposed to love like that), oh no, oh no, no
We ain't supposed to love like that

[Interlude: Jason Derülo & K. Michelle]
(No no, I just can't)
Nah, don't stop
(Oh, no, I don't wanna stop)
Yeah, just like that
(Just go)

[Verse 3: Jason Derülo & K. Michelle]
This ain't no shit that can be planned (be planned)
Some people never find love, maybe we can (we can)
Maybe we can, but I feel so guilty (I do too)
But living this life without you just might kill me
Get it how you want it, I be on it, ain't no days off
Kiss it, grab it, turn it, baby, I'ma keep my Jays on
My Jays, my Jays, my Jays, no way, ooh
(We ain't supposed to love like that), no way, no way, no way
Why do I feel so good, doing something so bad? Woo

[Chorus: Jason Derülo]
We ain't supposed to love like that
But we ain't supposed to love like that
Uh, we ain't supposed to love like that
We ain't supposed to love like that, yeah

[Verse 4: Jason Derülo]
Nah we ain't supposed to fuck like that
We ain't supposed to touch like that
Damn, it's too much, too much, might crack
Pressure burst pipes, baby, I'ma bust back
I'ma bust back baby, I'ma bust back
Yeah, oh, yeah
No way, no way, no way
We ain't supposed to love like that
