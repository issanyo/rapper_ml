Got you gone and I feel the same too
These dudes mad cause they really ain't you

[Verse 1]
Oh, I got my own shit, don't want your money

These niggas is trying to shoot but you got the lay up
Ain't none of them telling the truth, nope

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, I done dodged so many ceremonies
Coulda had fifty mil in alimony
Give you everything, what you want from me?
You know, everybody's got a testimony
Like I used to fuck with your old homie
You the only one I keep it hundred with, you know
Paparazzi waiting at the party when I leave here

Gone off that liquor, I'm always so honest, don't mind what I say
But tell all your bitches, I told all my niggas to stay in their place

[Pre-Hook]

I know you're gone off that liquor, ain't you?
These dudes mad cause they really ain't you
