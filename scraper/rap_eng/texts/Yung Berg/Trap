[Intro - Los]
I’m on a PJ in my PJs with a QP of that KU
SH IT you need ID when they play you

[Verse 1 - Yung Berg]
Several times these fraud niggas tried to combat me on fuck shit
But I bounce back on these niggas
Gave they hoes ???
Left the club with Ray J
And gave two hoes one wish
Five star, getting dough
Spent two hunnit on one bitch
And your ho like damn I seen him
Shopping with a bitch in Neimans?
Only came for the bitches and the drinks
Trey Songz, T.I., two reasons
Bow hard bet Louis Vuitton
They greeting me with Rose
Just left K. Smith crib bout to link with Meek ???
And I’m bout, I’m bout it, these bitches know I’m bout it
Had a table with Rihanna
Can’t see cause the shit too crowded
Brought my bitch here and her bitch here
Plus she brought her friends here
Rolling like a wheelchair
Me and my nigga Sincere, go!

[Hook: Yung Berg & Los]
A hunnit racks, fuck is that?
I drop it back, she threw it back
All we do is trap, all we all we do is trap
All we do is trap, all we all we do is trap
All we do is trap, all we all we do is trap
All we do is trap, all we all we do is trap
Hunnit racks, fuck is that?
All we do is trap, all we all we do is trap

[Verse 2 - Los]
Look
Just grabbed that Medina
Bout to snatch the summer
That bitch black on black like Whoopi fucking Danny Glover
Fucked up that Medina
Had to snatch the Bentley
That bitch triple white I call it Janet, Jack and Chrissy
She said “Oh my god you sexy
Los, your style's the nicest”
I don’t pop no Britney but I pop that Miley Cyrus
I dropped her too she popped her too
Her girlfriend I pop her too
Got the proper dick and when I drop the shit
Now I’m the one she screaming poppa to
I go ham, ham
All red drop top Lamb
She got that wham, bam
Then when she drop that shit, god damn
My drop top on rollerblades
My niggas in Paris
And we going cray

[Hook]
