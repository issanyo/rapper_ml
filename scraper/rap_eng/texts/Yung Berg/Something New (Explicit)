Hook: (Zae France x MizzyLott)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh)

Since I got a taste of your love (Oh yeah)
Baby, come give me something new (Ooh, woah)

Verse: (MizzyLott)
Word to who
Baby
You say you wanna
Be my little boo
Yeah yeah
I'ma treat the pussy
Like a full course meal
I always take my time
Wit my food

Both in the mood for something new
Yeah
I'll eat the pussy by the pool
Yeah
It took no time to catch a groove
But I need you to give me
Something

Hook:

Verse 2: (Zae France)
We always do this every weekend
You act like you heard a noise while you sleepin
When I pull up
You say you tweakin
Your little games

By the end
Of the night
I'ma end up
Leaving that lil pussy leaking

But you know that's part of your plan
Baby girl I understand
That you got needs too
But baby let's try something new

Hook:
Same
