[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Take your time on me (Time)
Take your time on me (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Don't you worry 'bout no bitches, I'ma curve 'em (Curve)
Thought I'd drop you off a bag 'cause you been workin' (You've been workin')
Don't just get yourself a bag, get you a Birkin
We should take a couple shots because they thirsty

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Take your time on me (On me, me, me)
Take your time on me (Yeah, oh)

[Verse 2: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
Take you to the East of the Chi-Town (Of the Chi-Town)
I might put some sweet in my Fanta (Ooh, yeah)
Cruisin' in the Benz with some Germans (Ooh, ooh)
Still got the Backwood burnin'

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Just take your time on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just take your time for me (For me, for me)

[Verse 3: Jeremih, Ty Dolla $ign & Both]
It don't make no sense, that don't make no sense
Way you work that pole, yes, I'm convinced
Stingy with your ass like Kobe with the pass
You could be my one and only, but I can't
Why you actin' innocent? Goddamn it
Can you bring your friends again? Why can't we?
Take a pill, get naked quick, that's damnin'
I like how you do that shit (Shit)

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
Take your time on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take your time on me (On me, for me)
Take your time on me (On me, me, me)
Take your time on me (For me, for me)
