Round here
You better watch what you do, what you say when you come around here
We don’t play
Cause people die everyday in the streets and we bring the fucking heat
Yo we some dope boy niggas
Quick to pull triggers
Baskin' on yourselves, it's an empire round here
An empire round here, it’s an empire round here

[Verse 3: Yung Berg]
Yo single supply show mother fuckers
Cause I'm way flyer than them grown mother fuckers
Watch you ball on niggas like I'm playing for the Rutgers
Hate me so you love it but I know you niggas wonder
How a nigga come and see something on the internet
Two chicks, two bricks, tell me where the blizzies at (round here)
See the money talk for me like a nigga do (shut up)
I told her come out top, it's just to match the coupe (ya dig)
And me and Bubz we piff never track the loop
I think he caught me in second right after Snoop (we smoking)
And them hoes don’t play, they get down here
Big chain, big money, it's going down around here

Round here
You better watch what you do, what you say when you come around here
We don’t play
Cause people die everyday in the streets and we bring the fucking heat
Yo we some dope boy niggas
Quick to pull triggers
Baskin' on yourselves, it's an empire round here
An empire round here, it’s an empire round here

[Verse 3: Shiest Bubz]
They know me as the emperor
Purple, that’s my signature
Author of the piffington (ayyye)
Writer of the swaggerer
Billion dollar Bumpington, Harlem's ambassador
Byrd got me so much money I just got to laugh at ya
Kee kee ha ha ha (ha ha ha) see me in the Aston Martin
Ultra violet leather cuts, BBs laughing though
If you're lookin for me, you can find me with the claviature
Don’t forget I'm shiesty, plus I'm not a rapper (not a rapper)
Dudes I'm from the city, buck sixty, with the baddest hun
Nails fitted, hair did stopping all of traffic up
And that’s on camera for all the amateurs
Big money round here ain't a problem

Round here
You better watch what you do, what you say when you come around here
We don’t play
Cause people die everyday in the streets and we bring the fucking heat
Yo we some dope boy niggas
Quick to pull triggers
Baskin' on yourselves, it's an empire round here
An empire round here, it’s an empire round here

[Verse 3: Rozay Richie]
Them niggas act if they deserve Oscars
Seventeen years old, we had twin boxers
We sent shots to the imposters
Shrimp scampi, crab legs, big lobsters
We hollering money over everything
Streets is my bitch; hundred shots was the wedding ring
I love the 40 but the AR bust back
Haze and the dutch match the speed when I dust past
And tell them Purple City where I be
And when you done with the homie, come and try me
Yeah and my bitch had a centerfold
So don’t call my line unless you ten fold

Round here
You better watch what you do, what you say when you come around here
We don’t play
Cause people die everyday in the streets and we bring the fucking heat
Yo we some dope boy niggas
Quick to pull triggers
Baskin' on yourselves, it's an empire round here
An empire round here, it’s an empire round here
