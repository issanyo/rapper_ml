[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
I be with the Hitmaker

[Chorus]
I can't, I can’t, I can't getcha, getcha off my mind (mind, mind, oh)
I can't, I can’t, I can't getcha, getcha off my mind (yeah)
I can't, I can't, I can't getcha, getcha off my mind (mind, oh)
I can't, I can't, I can't getcha, getcha off my mind (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fri-, tick, boom, tick, tick, tick, tick, boom
No bitch look like you
We should do some quick things in the room
Tell yo ex, she can take that back seat
I’ma buy a dozen roses, buy a dozen Rollies
Lock it down, thats what you need (woo, woo)
Get behind you ’til you go to sleep (woo, ohh)
It's somethin’ bout ya, its only midnight
I wanna touch on it, until it feels right (yeah)
Lets take a jet, show you what that feel like
I put you on

[Chorus]
I can't, I can't, I can't getcha, getcha off my mind (mind, oh)
I can’t, I can't, I can't getcha, getcha off my mind (yeah)
I can't, I can't, I can't getcha, getcha off my mind (mind, oh)
I can't, I can't, I can't getcha, getcha off my mind (yeah, yeah)
