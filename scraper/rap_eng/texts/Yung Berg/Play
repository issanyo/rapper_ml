[Chorus]
Wanna play with you, wanna play with you
Wanna play with you, you, you
Woah, show and tell
Wanna play with you
Woah, show and tell
Wanna play with you (ayy, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Hey boy, why you all in your feelings?
Tell me what are we beefing for?
Hey boy, got my legs to his ceiling
While I purr, just take it off

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I just lied when I said it was nothing
And he wanted to just be friends
Give me all your time, I need all your attention
Baby, I'm never finished with you

[Chorus]
Wanna play with you, wanna play with you (woo)
Wanna play with you, you, you
Woah, show and tell
Wanna play with you
Woah, show and tell
Wanna play with you (ayy, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Huh, I'm just tryna lay with ya
Get you back to my place, play some game with ya
Let me know if that's okay with ya
Tryna spark a conversation, light a flame with ya
Pull up, no ceiling, no roof
Boy, you're the gin, I'm the juice
Yeah, I know it's been a lot we've been going through
But I wanna make it up to you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I just lied when I said it was nothing
And he wanted to just be friends
Give me all your time, I need all your attention
Baby, I'm never finished with you

[Chorus]
Wanna play with you, wanna play with you (hey)
Wanna play with you, you, you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woah, show and tell
Wanna play with you
Woah, show and tell
Wanna play with you (ay, yeah)

[Verse 3]
See, I ain't 'bout no games, I just want, need a taste
Anytime, any place, boy, just give it to me
If you're down, we can roll anywhere I go
'Cause I'm never finished with you

[Chorus]
Wanna play with you, wanna play with you
Wanna play with you, you, you (hey)
Woah, show and tell
Wanna play with you
Woah, show and tell (show and tell)
Wanna play with you (ah, woo)
