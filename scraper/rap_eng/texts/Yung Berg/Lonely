[Intro]
Yeah, yeah ya kno
Got you covered

[Verse 1]
Errytime I go to da club mos of da time
Recently a sexy girl in front a mi bustin a while

It's some exercise follo wa makes it sign
Fuk on me cyar so she love how de seats recline
Fuk on me yard me a keep a di bird mi grinds

[Chorus]
She lonely, she lonely
Said she wann me to hold her now
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely
Said she wann get to kno me now
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely
Said she wann to take di radar
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely

[Verse 2]
Shawty said she want a baller like I
Do her in the G5, let her fly high with the fritz of the Chi
Why ask why, ya ain't gotta say much
Pull the curtains back and let the seats recline
So young but I'm bout money
Used to have brown bag under the couch money
Now I'm all there, you ain't gotta count money
Probably the reason your girlfriend so lonely

[Chorus]
She lonely, she lonely
Said she wann me to hold her now
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely
Said she wann get to kno me now
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely
Said she wann to take di radar
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely

[Verse 3]
Look her, look girl girl

But da good pum me knows take na flight me notin
Long time you kna otha guy between yo thighs
Come back for mi a girl an let me be ya sumhin
Come make dis company long me no rate mi nuthin
If ya no tell mi a joke or push mi button

[Chorus]
She lonely, she lonely
Said she wann me to hold her now
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely
Said she wann get to kno me now
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely
Said she wann to take di radar
Yeah she lonely, oh so lonely
Yeaah
