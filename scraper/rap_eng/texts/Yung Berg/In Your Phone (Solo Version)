[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign and Lauren Jauregui]
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong (do you wrong)
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong (do you wrong)

[Verse]
Chick-chicks on you
Too many of them
When I'm in the room, I feel their eyes on me
Got some nerve saying I'm the challenge
But I know, I know that you know
I've been damaged
You be all nerves, and your love is the best
But I get so in my head when you keep shit to yourself
Why you always in your phone?
Can't you talk to me?
'Cause I know what you need and more
Them not to squeal, I can't ignore

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign and Lauren Jauregui]
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong (do you wrong)
You always in your phone
I feel like you do me wrong (do you wrong)
