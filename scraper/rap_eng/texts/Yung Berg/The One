[Verse 1]
You know very well who you are
You’re the only one, you got my heart
And you had a few
Boy, one too many
But I’m the only one to wake you up
(It was all a dream)

[Pre-Chorus]
I reminisce the way we kissed, it felt so personal
You took the chance to get my love and now you know
(It was all a dream)
And I don't need no one baby
Without you I’m incomplete
My love is just like the bar, put it all on me

[Chorus]
I don't want nobody else
Baby, all I need is you
You're the one I want
And I don't want nobody else
Baby, all I need is you
You're the one I want

[Verse 2]
You know very well you’re a star
Cause I don’t go that far, look where we are
And it ain't none like you, one in a million
But I’m the only one to count you, oh
(It was all a dream)

[Pre-Chorus]
I reminisce the way we kissed, it felt so personal
You took the chance to get my love and now you know
(It was all a dream)
That I don’t even know one, baby
Without you I’m incomplete
My love is just like the bar, put it all on me

[Chorus]
I don't want nobody else
Baby, all I need is you
You're the one I want
And I don't want nobody else
Baby, all I need is you
You're the one I want

[Pre-Chorus]
I reminisce the way we kissed, it felt so personal
You took the chance to get my love and now you know
(It was all a dream)
That I don’t even know one, baby
Without you I’m incomplete
My love is just like the bar, put it all on me, yeah

[Outro]
Put it all on me
Put it all on, put it all on, put it all on me
Put it all on me
Put it all on, put it all on, put it all on me
Put it all on, put it all on, put it all on me
Put it all on, put it all on, put it all on me
