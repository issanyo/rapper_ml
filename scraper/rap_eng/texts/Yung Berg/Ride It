[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Too many dollars, she fuck around, get 'em all (Oh yeah)
On the floor, she gon' rack it up, non stop
Diamonds and rubies, she don't wanna feel like a groupie
And I'm tryna leave with a two piece, yeah, ayy
Let a nigga pull her panties to the side
Ain't no telling how she feeling inside
Say your best friend down for the try, yeah
Rollie hatin' on me, never on time
Henny shots, make a nigga go rounds
From the front, I can see that shit bounce

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I want you doing your dance
I spent this all advance, sloppy do it with no hands
While I blow this cash, topping me while I'm driving
Don't make me crash
She said, "slow it down, lets make this last"
Girl, you remind me of my Benz the way that pussy soak
Classic, try to smack it in her 'Ray, but ain't no room up in that backseat
Couple California kings, I need more room for all this action
I'll buy you the highest fashion
Watch you trying to fit that ass in

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
She ride it (Ohh)
She ride it, oh yeah (Oh)
She ride it, yeah
She ride it, oh yeah
On top of me (On top of me), she ride it, oh yeah (She ride it)
She ride it, ayy
She ride it, oh yeah (Ohh)
She ride it (She ride)
She ride it, oh yeah (Woah)
She ride it, yeah (Oh woah)
She ride it, oh yeah (She ri-i-i-i-i-de)
On top of me (On top), she ride it, oh yeah (Ohh)
She ride it, ayy
She ride it, oh yeah

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
On top of me
And don't hide that shit
Girl, ride that shit
Don't stop that shit

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She ride it (What)
