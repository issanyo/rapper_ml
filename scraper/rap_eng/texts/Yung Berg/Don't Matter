[Verse 1]
When we put in the work, it's gon' be a long night
Come by where you live, won't take no time
When I'm all in the middle, where you wanna go now?
We could bring it up top, tell me what's on your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I be knocking down the walls every time you make that call
You be changing all your plans, but you're callin' me your man
You got something I can feel, baby, girl, it's been so long
I been, I been having withdrawals, I been having withdrawals
Yeah, wouldn't you know it, tell me if you know this
I've been doing good (I've been doing good)
We had it all, baby, right all my wrongs, baby
Loving you so good (loving you so good, yeah)

[Chrous]
I don't know how to feel when I'm close to you
Late nights holding you, laid my eyes on you
I'm gon' ride for you (oh yeah)
When I'm close to you, late nights holding you
We ain't got all day, don't really care what they say
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
Nah, it don't matter to me, nah, nah

[Verse 2]
Girl, it don't matter to me, I'll bring us into the beach
Down in that ocean, we rockin' a boat
Girl, you're much like Aaliyah to me
One in a million, you one of a kind
Baby, you blowin, you blowin my mind
All of my neighbours, they wanna know why (know why)

[Pre-Chorus]
I be knocking down the walls every time you make that call
You be changing all your plans, but you're callin' me your man
You got something I can feel, baby, girl, it's been so long
I been, I been having withdrawals, I been having withdrawals
Yeah, wouldn't you know it, tell me if you know this
I've been doing good (I've been doing good)
We had it all, baby, right all my wrongs, baby
Loving you so good (loving you so good)

[Chrous]
I don't know how to feel when I'm close to you
Late nights holding you, laid my eyes on you
I'm gon' ride for you (oh yeah)
When I'm close to you, late nights holding you
We ain't got all day, don't really care what they say
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
Nah, it don't matter to me, nah, nah
