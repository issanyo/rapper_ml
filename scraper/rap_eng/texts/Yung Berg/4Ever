(Intro)
You know that it's forever girl
Yeah, bitch, yeah
Ay ay ay you know that it's forever girl
It's forever baby!

(Verse 1)
She crazy, she sexy, she cool, she let me
Ride it all night and then she give me that TLC
Fuck you niggas gon' tell me? Throw my money might as well be
Cause I'm out chea, out chea and i'll only dropped one LP
I couldn't let a girl like you pass
I would trade my seat to coach to let you ride first class
We straight to the bank, fifty G's, let it burn (yeah)
They say time is money well you ain't gotta earn that

(Chorus - Mia Rey)
You could be my boyfriend, I could be your baby
Start it off slow and see where we could take it
Anything you do boy got me so crazy...
I never thought that I could be in love wit ya never say never
And now I got you in my life I'mma love you forever

(Verse 2)
She crazy, she sexy, she cool, she let me
Fuck her all night and make her cum at the count of 3
Fuck you niggas gon' tell me? (tell 'em) throw my money might as well be
Cause I'm out chea, out chea and i'll only dropped one LP
I couldn't let a girl like you pass
I would trade my seat to coach to let you ride first class
We straight to the bank, fifty G's, let it burn (yeah)
They say time is money well you ain't gotta earn that

(Chorus - Mia Rey)
You could be my boyfriend, I could be your baby
Start it off slow and see where we could take it
Anything you do boy got me so crazy...
I never thought that I could be in love wit ya never say never
And now I got you in my life I'mma love you forever

(Bridge)
I never thought that I could be in love wit ya never say never
And now I got you in my life I'mma love you forever

(Chorus - Mia Rey)
You could be my boyfriend, I could be your baby

Anything you do boy got me so crazy...
I never thought that I could be in love wit ya never say never
And now I got you in my life I'mma love you forever
Forever (X16)
