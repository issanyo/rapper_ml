[Verse 1]
Uhhhh King
I got some money on me
I got my niggas with me
I got a light skinned bitch that be jiggy with me
I got some pussy with me but I ain't got no pussies with me
And we ballin but ain't no rookies with me
Man I'm in that Martin but ain't no Gina with me
She told me, "Ike this pussy boy bring out that Tina in me"
I said momma I'm the same
She was blinded by the chain
I said I'm I'm a problem I should sign with Diamond Lane
She said oochie oochie wally, I said wally wally bang
Throw my girl an oochie alley
Let her wally it while I bang
Spent some dollars for the chain
Pennys for the rollie
Shit shoulda came with two bitches and a goalie
If she kick with the homies all these bitches fitting to know me
No wonder you be cuffing man these niggas is the police
It's '03, my niggas had blow out like Kobe
It's B-more if these whore get money then show me
King!

[Hook]
28's on the ride
Two bad bitches waiting outside
Big house with the lake on the side
Plus I had a dream all the fake niggas died
All the fake niggas died
Plus I had a dream all the fake niggas died
All the fake niggas died
Plus I had a dream all the fake niggas died
Now what the hell is you looking for?
Can't a young nigga get any money anymore?
Let my mink sag down to the floor
Had me a bad bitch with out no flaws

[Verse 2]
I got some goons with me, I got ya bitch with me
I got my whole city mobbing got some shit with me
I got my team with me, no they ain't playing with you
They waving arms, ain't doing the Nae Nae with you
I said I'm prolly at the [?]
Prolly having a ball-off
Prolly at the Waldolf
Prolly never fall off
Prolly party with ya bitch
She prolly in my call log
I prolly put the coupe or prolly pile them in the four door
Prolly pop a body like she trying to cock a sawed off
She prolly popped a molly
Man she prolly poppin zolaf
Prolly throw a hundred hundreds on her when I'm faded
I prolly took the roof off the Rari and then I skated
