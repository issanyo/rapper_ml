[Verse 1: August Alsina]
When we put in the work, it's gon' be a long night
Come by where you live, won't take no time
When I'm all in the middle, where you wanna go now?
We could bring it up top, tell me what's on your mind

[Pre-Chorus: August Alsina]
I be knocking down the walls every time you make that call
You be changing all your plans, but you're callin' me your man
You got something I can feel, baby, girl, it's been so long
I been, I been having withdrawals, I been having withdrawals

Yeah, wouldn't you know it, tell me if you know this
I've been doing good (I've been doing good)
We got it all, baby, right all my wrongs, baby
Loving you so good (loving you so good, yeah)

[Chrous: August Alsina]
I don't know how to feel when I'm close to you
Late nights holding you, laid my eyes on you
I'm gon' ride for you (oh yeah)
When I'm close to you, late nights holding you
We ain't got all day, don't really care what they say
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
Nah, it don't matter to me, nah, nah

[Verse 2: ZAYN]
It don't matter to me
I bring the sand to the beach
Dive in the ocean, we rocking' the boat
Girl, you look like Aaliyah to me yeah
One in a million, you're one of a kind
Baby you blowing, you're blowing my mind
All of my neighbors they wanna know why (know why)

[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN]
I be knocking down them walls every time you make that call
You be changing all your plans, but you're callin' me your man
You got something I can feel, baby girl, it's been so long
I been, I been having withdrawals, I been having withdrawals

Yeah, wouldn't you know it, tell me if you know this
I've been doing good (I've been doing good)
We got it all, baby, right all my wrongs, baby
Loving you so good (loving you so good)

[Chrous: August Alsina]
I don't know how to feel when I'm close to you
Late nights holding you, laid my eyes on you
I'm gon' ride for you (oh yeah)
When I'm close to you, late nights holding you
We ain't got all day, don't really care what they say
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
Nah, it don't matter to me, nah, nah
