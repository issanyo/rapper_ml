[Chorus]
Soon as I get home
I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home
I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

[Verse 1]
On right now and I'm feeling the drink
I had like 2 or 3 and I'm on right now
I came ready to play
Baddies in a full circle tonight
You know why I came
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

[Pre-Chorus]
2 AM vibes
DJ, turn it up, let's get right
We can't get enough of this life
We gon' fuck it up, yeah
We gon' fuck it up one time

[Chorus]
Soon as I get home
I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home
I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

[Verse 2]
All my ladies, drop it to the floor
And if you got a man, leave him at home
Fellas, if you got a girl, don't tell 'em that
Just live it up tonight, live it up tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we in this 2 AM vibes
DJ, turn it up, let's get right
