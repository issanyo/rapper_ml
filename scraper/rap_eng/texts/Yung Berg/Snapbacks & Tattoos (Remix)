[Intro]
Remix! {Juice Gang mu'fucka}
Let's go!

[Roscoe Dash]
Snapbacks, tattoos, bathrobe and my house shoes
Bombay and bad bitches for hatin' niggas that's bad news
Sad news is they past due, just went and got a new tattoo
Say "I don't give a fuck", just in case somebody ask you
Your opinion, bitch I'm +Gilligan+, got an island and I fly in
Need a bunch of hoes from Thailand, they wanna bang cock so I dive in
I shinin' and survin', situations you die in
I'm outta sight like I'm hidin', like a heatin' dose when it's risin'
You in +106+ in your park, been number 1 from the start
I could take a break, come back and be straight to fuck hoes to start
My staircase is in charge, we fucks better get on top of yo game
Don't need no big house or no chain, to show these copy cats I'm the man
Just these

[Hook: Driicky Graham]
Snap backs and tattoos, snap backs and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks, all dat cause cash rules 
Snap backs and tattoos, snap backs and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks, all dat cause cash rules 
Uh, show off ya hats, show off ya tats
Show off ya arms, legs, chest, show off ya backs
Snap backs and tattoos, snap backs and tattoos
N-N-Nice whips, fly chicks, all dat cause CASH RULES...

{N-W-E-N-G}

[Driicky Graham]
Ever since I made snapbacks, I done blown on the internet, and I got the whole entire globe wanna get a tatt
It's a fact, ever since this song put me on, not a nigga known with a fitted gon' and get rid of that
Given that all these damn haters wanna chitter chat, "He ain't got enough tatts bro, what ya twitted at?"
Hol' up this my song, these my balls, please hop off 'em and give 'em back
End the track I'm the gas fuel, beat it up, need a stab wound
I'm a meteor, finna crash soon, put the heat in ya like a crack spoon
Driicky fresh as Nas with that caesar cut and a half moon
Or Yeezy West but I ain't tryna keep up with the Kardashians
Vroom vroom when I pass thru, get up out my way, stupid
Tried to lock me out the game, me I just bust straight thru it
Now I just be killin' shit, can't stop no break fluid
All these bottles to the head, you woulda thought that Drake threw it
Fuck the haters that ain't want me to win
Man I'm over niggas heads and I'm under yo skin
Like a snapback and tattoo, and jayed on to the south
Driicky tatt on yo girl pussy so I stay up in yo mouth, ah

[Hook]

[French Montana]
(MONTANA) Snapback and tattoo, fly car and fly jewel
+Wu-Tang+, cash rule, 2 Chainz, that's true
I show off my hat (hat), then show off my whip (whip)
She show off her tatt (tatt), then show off her hip
Slide out to the back room, tattoo some cartoon
Snapbacks, New Era, ass duke, blue devil
New car with that new chain, money tall like Luol Deng
Killed the game like new gang, snapback that roof man
Throw it back she bend it over, throw her back I'm jumpin' over
Her lower back, that money long ain't foldin' back, hundred stack
Buy at the bar, bitch up in the car, come fuck with a star
Look at the mall, go buy out the mall, white double LR

[Cash Out]
I say snapbacks and tattoos, now yo ho wanna fuck
She seen my in that Lamborghini, not the car this truck
Big diamond off in my ear, I call 'em golf balls
And when we hit the club we don't softball we ball hard
Yeah, look at my shoes, they red bottoms
Look at yo bitch, she wanna follow
She goin' down, she wanna swallow
Money is the name, but baby that's my role model
Yeah, just gimme the beat Ima kill it man it's nothin'
Just gimme a freak Ima kill her man it's nothin'
Ha, and my pockets so fat and baby I'm still stuffin'
Get in my way for the Jacobs man I'm truckin' ya dig?
Ha, look at my gat, look at my jewel
The Rollie baby, I tell the truth
You play with me, you make the news
Got plenty snapbacks but I feel like I need more tattoos
No lie..
