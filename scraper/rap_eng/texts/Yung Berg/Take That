(Intro)
Thanks Tm88, Big Sean, and Juicy J. Also T.I. thank you very much for this remix. Ok, let's go!

(Hook)
I got red and white shoes and their for Yamine
Watch me walk in these boys
With a freaking machine
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
I know you wanna take that?
I'mma throw some more
Roll the dough
Cuz my job's like that
I just want that ready ready whip
And it's just like that
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
I know you wanna shake that

(Verse 1)
Alright here I go
They usually call me a boss
All white teeth with floss
If you talking to me then I'll just cut you off
Isaac The Rapper is straight GOD
I'm the Prince Of Rap
Please don't give me a fucking pawn
I'm not playing
I'm not a spawn
You can take that, now you gone
Tm88 and T.I. still go to prone
B.O.B still in his zone
2013 he ain't even home
He the king and I'm not wrong
I'm the beast and I love my tone

(Hook)
I got red and white shoes and their for Yamine
Watch me walk in these boys
With a freaking machine
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
I know you wanna take that?
I'mma throw some more
Roll the dough
Cuz my job's like that
I just want that ready ready whip
And it's just like that
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
I know you wanna shake that

[Verse 2]
I pull up on this nigga, he was nervous
Nigga so scary, I'm suprised that nigga served us
I'ma come and get it, that's that front door service
But I'm picky to myself that I should murk 'em
My nigga like hold him, give him a chance
He made us come all the way for his bands
Plus I'm tweaking and geeking off all these xans
Here he come right now, he walking to the van
He like always Yamine and he a fan
I sipped it real slow as I shook his hand
I'm like fuck all that groupie shit, you the man

(Hook)
I got red and white shoes and their for Yamine
Watch me walk in these boys
With a freaking machine
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
I know you wanna take that?
I'mma throw some more
Roll the dough
Cuz my job's like that
I just want that ready ready whip
And it's just like that
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
How can you take that?
I know you wanna shake that
