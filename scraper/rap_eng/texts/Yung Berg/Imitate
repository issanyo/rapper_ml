Hitmaka

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $Ign]
Ohhh, anything you want
I'll swear, I'll give it to you
Can't imitate how, I feel
When I think about, you
You, you, you
You, you, you

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Who you gon' trust if you won't trust me?
Who you gon' love if you won't love me? Ohh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Can't play both side, that's suicide for you and I
Don't wanna waste your time, so don't waste mine
And I take all night, take you down, down

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $Ign]
Ohhh, anything you want
I'll swear, I'll give it to you
Can't imitate how, I feel
When I think about, you
You, you, you
You, you, you

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
What you feeling, feeling?
Express your feelings, feelings
Sexual healer, healer
And I'ma lay up with you all night
Baby, take the panties on down
Come, show Dolla love now
Can't nobody take my place

[Pre-Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't play both side, that's suicide for you and I
Don't wanna waste your time, so don't waste mine
Gonna take all night, take you down, down

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $Ign]
Ohhh, anything you want
I'll swear, I give it to you
Can't imitate how, I feel
When I think about, you
You, you, you
You, you, you

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Girl, you know what's all about, yeah
