[Intro: Kid Ink]
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah
Said we ballin' we ballin' we ballin', yeah
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish
Get buckets

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
She got way too much potential
Smack that ass, cuz I know she into it
We in here 'til the mornin'
Breakfast continental
Drinks all complimentary
And I ain't showin' no credentials
She gon split the pole
And I'm gon' split the swisher
Girl that frame perfect
You know I get the bigger picture
Got a few thousand on me
Alley oop it, throw it to me
No, a nigga ain't Kobe
I pass it to the homies

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Got my signing bonus, millions on the way
Fuck her, then I hit her with the fadeaway
Finger rollin' bitches, feel like Doctor J
All these haters wanna watch my play by play

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Get buckets
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Crossed over on them folks
Not Anfernee, but Tim
I'm so high I can dunk on you in Timbs
Know you seen the film
Check the scouting report
Get on the baseline
Now lean on them folk (lean!)
She tired of giving head
So you know I left
Kenny Anderson, Van Exel and Travis Best
Niggas sayin' they traveling
Ain't took enough of these steps
Get your Marbury like Steph
Sittin’ courtside in Chanel
Tell ‘em hello like Adele
I'mma mac book you a Dell
You know I’m always prepared
Shit, I came up from a scale
Came up, clientele
Shawty thick, I’m like yeah
Nigga talkin’ ‘bout they ballin’
I told ‘em I can’t tell

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish, swish
Swish, swish, swish

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Got my signing bonus, millions on the way
Fuck her, then I hit her with the fadeaway
Finger rollin' bitches, feel like Doctor J
All these haters wanna watch my play by play

[Outro: Kid Ink]
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah
Said we ballin' we ballin' we ballin', yeah
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah
Said we ballin' we ballin' we ballin', yeah
Yeah we ballin' we ballin' and we ballin', yeah
(Swish!)
