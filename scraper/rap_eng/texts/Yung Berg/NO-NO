I do it how I want
And they don't like that
Yo girl get drunk
Like a six-pack
They say my lyrics
Dirty but they tic-tac
I'm chillin' wit my money
That's my kickback

[Chorus 1]:
No No did that ass
Wrong yet again
I let her do that dance in front
Call me a gentleman
I ain't really wanna party
But bad bitch came wit friends
Opportunity in red bottoms
Shit, I let her in

[Hook]:
I eat her salad
And her dressing
Ain't take no time
Ain't take no guessin'
Ain't been to church
She was a blessing
(Aye)
I'm in the gym
And that's no flexing
I reach down
To pull my weapon
I'll leave you
Down and out in Texas
(Aye)

[Verse 1]:
Good Evening
How you doing?
You talk Money
I speak fluent
I'm the gum
That she was chewing
(Aye)
.33
Patrick Ewing
Type of Drugs
Is you pursuin'?
Nolan B
Just what you doin'?
(Aye)
Killin' it, Grillin' it
She say that
She feelin' me
She island
Like gilligan
I'm drinkin'
The Killigans
She want me to
Fill her in
She told me to
Come again
Watch who
You runnin' wit
Pop
Now you don't exist
Real niggas
Know this shit
I hit me another lick
Don't care who you go and get
Have you singin' like Jodici

[Chorus 2]:
No No did that
Ass wrong yet again
I let her do that dance in front
Call me a gentleman
I'm only slidin' out fo'
That money, dividends
Heard that she got
That water, took a swim

[Hook]:
I eat her salad
And her dressing
Ain't take no time
Ain't take no guessin'
Ain't been to church
She was a blessing
(Aye)
I'm in the gym
And that's no flexing
I reach down
To pull my weapon
I'll leave you
Down and out in Texas
(Aye)

[Verse 2]:
(Aye)
Besides that
I hate it when that booty
Get me sidetracked
Got you bouncin' up and down
Jumpin'-Jacks
Gotta bottle of Bellaire
That's to relax
In my place
Of Zen
No don't call
Your friend
Depend on how I'm
Feeling shit, I might not let her in
I'm new to the city hoe
What you recommend?

[Chorus 2]:
No No did that
Ass wrong yet again
I let her do that dance in front
Call me a gentleman
I'm only slidin' out fo'
That money, dividends
Heard that she got
That water, took a swim

[Hook]:
I eat her salad
And her dressing
Ain't take no time
Ain't take no guessin'
Ain't been to church
She was a blessing
(Aye)
I'm in the gym
And that's no flexing
I reach down
To pull my weapon
I'll leave you
Down and out in Texas
(Aye)

[Verse 3]:
Said my flow is
Skyscraper, you can't top dat
My hittas' like Siri
They know where you at
I'm in Houston
Wit them Rockets
And they aimin'
At ya hat
I gave you what you wanted, baby
Gone and bring it back
(Aye)
Kill me wit that love
Heart-attack
All my niggas
In the club, wya?
I'm lookin' clean hoe
Sharp as a tac
(Aye)
Domino
(Aye)
Gone and fall back
(Aye, aye)
Get it from the sctratch
Do it from the top
Tryna get that 'act
(Aye)
I just want some bop
(Aye, hmmm)
My nigga just got shot
(Hmmm)
These white folk call the cops
(Aye)

[Chorus 2]:
No No did that
Ass wrong yet again
I let her do that dance in front
Call me a gentleman
I'm only slidin' out fo'
That money, dividends
Heard that she got
That water, took a swim
