Yung Berg:
Yeah. That's right. It's ya boy, and Pitbull

All my dogs say, "Make money money make money money money."
(Make money money make money money money.)
All my ladies say, "Take money money take money money money."
(Take money money take money money money.")

Yung Berg:
Shawty I love the way you shake it, cuz you drop it and break it
Makin a nigga wanna take it to the flo
And I ain't trippin on paper
Baby I wanted to make ya, so tell ya friends we can head to the mall. (Take Off)
You know I got a pill, here it is. (Take Off)
No reason keepin on all your clothes. (Take Off)
You know I'm gonna drive you crazy, gettin head on private plane right before I take off
I got a mean ol' swag cuz ya lead boy up
Tell 'em lean on that
Tell me baby, you ain't never seen on ?sash? Hundred gees all cash in my Gucci duffel bag. (Go)
Wednesday night (Go)
Catch me at ?shack? (Go)
Spanish bitch with me got these girls all bad. (Go)
Ay, and I'm so good
Spend twenty thou and I ain't worried bout that

Chorus:
Move girl and make that culo go pop
Ay make that culo go pop
Move girl and make that culo go pop
Ay make that culo go pop
Say, "Dale dale dale dale."
(Dale dale dale dale)
Say, "Dale dale dale dale."
(Dale dale dale dale)

Pitbull:
Can I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy I wouldn't mind again Satardaay ay ay. Ay ay ay
Round up your girls, let 'em know we on the way
I am what they wanna be
I'm always with a bad one
You need you a chico, you'll understand when you have one
Yung Berg, Pitbull. Baby it's official
We just wanna hit you where the Lord split you. (Oh!)
Dale mami, Dale mami
You can find me in the back of the club with two mami's gettin loose
Ask about me if you doubt me
Once I hit 'em and lick 'em they can't be without me.(Oh!)
Mami yo te lo quiero seltodo
No ta preguro tel novio [???]
