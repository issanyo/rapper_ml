[Intro]
808 Mafia
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
These dudes ain't got no wins
Still gon' talk like Letterman
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Hoes at the front door, let 'em in
Money at the front door, let her in
Cash at the front door, let him in, hey
Dudes got no wins
Still gon' talk like Letterman
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Cash at the front door, let 'em in
Money at the front door, let 'em in
Gas at the front door, let 'em in, hey

[Verse 1]
I just drank too much Gin
And I'm more drunk than I ever been
And I'm 'bout to roll up the medicine
Now they got a girl and her best friend
Let 'em take shots, now they feelin' it
Tell me that I'm better than her ex man
If I hit it once, I'ma hit again, yeah
I be gone with the wind
In a Hellcat can't handle it
Can't even push the whole pedal in
Y'all niggas broke, can't get it fixed
I'ma turn up, gon' hit a lick
Niggas that hate don't benefit
Puffy, all about my benjamins

[Chorus]
These dudes ain't got no wins
Still gon' talk like Letterman
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Hoes at the front door, let 'em in
Money at the front door, let her in
Cash at the front door, let him in, hey
Dudes got no wins
Still gon' talk like Letterman
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Cash at the front door, let 'em in
Money at the front door, let 'em in
Gas at the front door, let 'em in, hey

[Verse 2]
I got too much to spend
I'll make it rain like weatherman
All about the check like Federline
I was out in Pittsburgh, pedalin'
Way before I was on television
Pack so loud I'm yellin' it
Want KK? I'm sellin' it, yeah
All they do is pretend
Won't keep it real 'cause they never did
Talk about life they ain't ever live
Talk about stripes they ain't ever get
Lookin' for the right one to let 'em in
I'ma get her right, in her element
Brain so bright, she intelligent

[Chorus]
These dudes ain't got no wins
Still gon' talk like Letterman
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Hoes at the front door, let 'em in
Money at the front door, let her in
Cash at the front door, let him in, hey
Dudes got no wins
Still gon' talk like Letterman
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Girls at the front door, let 'em in
Cash at the front door, let 'em in
Money at the front door, let 'em in
Gas at the front door, let 'em in, hey
