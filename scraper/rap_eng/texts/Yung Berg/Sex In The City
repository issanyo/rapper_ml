From the Chi to VA 
Boy where ever u stay 
You know i just can't wait to have
Sex In The City with u

[Talking]Good morning ladys , its about that time again
And i did it for u

Aye !
So tell me what it is
Baby what it do
Shawty im just tryna put that business on u
Touch right there and make my move
No dinner needed , imma eat my boo
A freak like her plus a freak like me
Throw them legs ups, put ur hands on me
Nails in my back, lemme hear u scream
Face in the pillow til u cannot breath

I'll work it out all night, dont i do it so good
Tryna take my girl, tryna cop my bxtch , no u wish u could
Come straight from the Chi , she reppin' LA
Sex in the city, baby watch it all day
Shawty fxck like Samantha 
Choose like Karey 
Looking for a big date , tryna get married

So i met her on a monday 
Called her on a tuesday 
On wednesday we kissed and made a high def movie
We started in the shower , straight to the jacuzzi
Then she put it on me 
I said shawty don't stop , keep going

[Chorus] (GIRL)
I wanna be ur lover
Wanna be ur girl
Wanna be ur everything
Give u my world
Sex in the city, Sex in the city , Sex in the city
Sex in the city 
From NY to LA or Atlanta, GA
You know i just can't wait to have, Sex in the city
From the Chi to Va , boy where ever u stay
You know i just can't wait to have Sex in the city with u

Now tell me all ur vicky secrets 
Lemme know ur vicky secrets 
I wanna know , I wanna know
I I wanna know , I wanna know

Eat it from the back 
And give u head to the
Im tryna go deep, baby spread them cheeks
In my imagination , i can see u and me
Imagine ur drink , Sex on the beach

I'll work it out all night
Tryna take my girl, tryna cop my bxtch , no u wish u could
You know im coming from the Chi 
Shawty reppin ' VA
2 up , 2 down , lemme hit it sideways
Swag like Sharlet 
Face like Karey
Looking for a big date , tryna get married

So i met her on a monday 
Called her on a tuesday 
On wednesday we kissed and made a high def movie
We started in the shower , straight to the jacuzzi
Then she put it on me 
I said shawty don't stop , keep going , dont stop, dont stop

[Chorus] (GIRL)
I wanna be ur lover
Wanna be ur girl
Wanna be ur everything
Give u my world

From the Chi to Va , boy where ever u stay
You know i just can't wait to have Sex in the city with u

[Bridge]
