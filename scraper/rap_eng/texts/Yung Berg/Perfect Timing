[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
Hands on your body
This perfect timing
Every time you get around me (Round)
This perfect timing, ooh

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign & Jeremih]
Girl I know when things got bad (Bad)
But I don't know how this happened (Things)
To me it feels the same for you
I know you do, but
You on your Snapchat, talkin', talkin' (Talk)
I just hope that you do the walkin' (Walk)
Cause I wanna put you on my shit (My)
Introduce you to the fly shit, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
You like driving with no seat belt on, on, on
Ay, feel so hot, I can't cool off (Can't cool off)

[Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
Hands on your body (Time)
This perfect timing
Every time you get around me (Round)
This perfect timing, ooh
Hands on your body
This perfect timing
Ever time you get around me
This perfect timing, ooh

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Wish that I could take it back (Back)
Said some things I shouldn't have said (Said)
Meant it at the time
I know I take it way too far, oh
Oh, can't believe that you're tied down
You and me done switched sides, now
Fantasies are disguised, now, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
You like driving with no seat belt on, on, on
Feel so hot, I can't cool off (Can't cool off)

[Outro: Jeremih & Ty Dolla $ign]
Hands on your body (Time)
This perfect timing
Every time you get around me (Round)
(You get around) This perfect timing, ooh
Hands on your body (Hands on your body)
This perfect timing (Hands on your body, yeah)
Ever time you get around me
This perfect timing, ooh (You get around)
Hands on your body (Hands on your body, woah)
This perfect timing (This perfect timing, ooh yeah)
Hands on your body (Hands on your body)
Ooh, hoo, This perfect timing
