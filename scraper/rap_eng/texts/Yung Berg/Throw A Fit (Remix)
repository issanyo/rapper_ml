[Intro: Tinashe]
Nashe might just pop it on a handstand
Hitmaka!

[Chorus: Tinashe]
I'm the shit, I know I'm the shit, yeah, I'm super lit If you don't buy me what I want, I'ma throw a fit I'm the shit, I know I'm the shit, yeah, I'm super lit If you don't buy me what I want, I'ma throw a fit She the shit, yeah, she super lit, she know she the shit If you don't buy her what she want, she gon' throw a fit She the shit, she know she the shit, yeah, she super lit If you don't buy her what she want, she gon' throw a fit

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Hey, brand new coupe, I'm backing out (I’m backing out)
Spend that shit, I buy you out (I buy you out)
Ay, pussy wet all by herself (Your pussy wet)
And if he drown, I ain't gon' help (No)
Bag day, buy your bag day
Fuck the tab say
Cash out on the Cash app
I blew past that

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
Nasty, yeah, she nasty
They can't stand me
Nashe might just pop it on a handstand

[Chorus: Tinashe & 96ix]
I'm the shit, I know I'm the shit, yeah, I'm super lit
If you don't buy me what I want, I'ma throw a fit
I'm the shit, I know I'm the shit, yeah, I'm super lit
If you don't buy me what I want, I'ma throw a fit
She the shit, yeah, she super lit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want, she gon' throw a fit
She the shit, she know she the shit, yeah, she super lit
If you don't buy her what she want

[Verse 2: 96ix]
Sheesh
I still thought it was Tuesday
Still hope that you stay
Cause last night it got fucked up
I put Vodka in your double cup
Then I told ya friend you should double up (Team)
Double team on me, don’t you get mean to me
On her MP3 she got empty beats
You could sing for me
Yeah do it for me
Do it for me
Better watch your phone don’t ring ring
All eyes on me, that’s right (That’s right)
Put it on the side, turn off the lights
And if you don’t get what you want you prolly be like

[Chorus: Tinashe & 96ix]
I'm the shit, I know I'm the shit, yeah, I'm super lit
If you don't buy me what I want, I'ma throw a fit
I'm the shit, I know I'm the shit, yeah, I'm super lit
If you don't buy me what I want, I'ma throw a fit
She the shit, yeah, she super lit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want, she gon' throw a fit
She the shit, she know she the shit, yeah, she super lit
If you don't buy her what she want, she gon’ throw a fit
