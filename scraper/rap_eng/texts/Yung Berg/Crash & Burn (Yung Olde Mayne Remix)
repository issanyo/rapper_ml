[Chorus: Kehlani]
Live each day like it's your last
’Cause you never feel the moment 'til it's passed (Hitmaka!)
Oh-oh
Time just keeps on ticking fast (you know?)
Know, there’s danger in the lesson learned
Slow down before you crash and burn

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
These my day-ones I'm surrounded by
So everyone you see me with is down to ride
These girls be goin' crazy when they see the life
And I be selling dreams I know she's down to buy
The voices in my head tell me I should be honest
But I don't pay attention, I don't hear their comments (yeah)
And it's bananas what I spend on diamonds
Understand me, this is cut from nothing economics
Living to the maximum, all these checks I'm cashing ’em
’Cause this could disappear quicker than how fast it comes
And I'm so high I’m numb
Living fast, I'm lapping 'em
Liquor, drugs, and sex addiction; I'm all of ’em wrapped in one
See me hoppin' in a Wraith
Putting 15 million in a safe
Mama called on my birthday like "Hallelujah! 28, you made it out of 27 safe"

[Chorus: Kehlani & (G-Eazy)]
Live each day like it's your last (like it's your last)
'Cause you never feel the moment 'til it's passed (you never know it 'til it's gone, yeah)
Oh-oh
Time just keeps on ticking fast (you know?)
Know, there's danger in the lesson learned
Slow down before you crash and burn
Oh-oh (yeah)
Oh-oh (you know)
Better, slow down before you crash and burn (yeah)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Never lose control, but I get close to it
Live in the moment, I'm just tryna make the most of it
The other night I swear I took down the baddest bitch
I passed out, she snuck a pic and she posted it
That makes a hundred problems, I just counted it
Everything's authentic, this ain't counterfeit
I'm just tryna make my mama proud of it
Stay in control up until you spiral out of it
Living fast as freeways, I ain't slept in three days
Making money three ways, keep on running these plays
And I don't need praise, I need more paid days
Need more vacays, never took the safe way
I'm living like the villain does
They say karma's comin' 'round but until it does
I'ma do these drugs 'til I feel a buzz
I ain't slowin' down, I'm tryna live it up

[Chorus: Kehlani & (G-Eazy)]
Live each day like it's your last (like it's your last)
'Cause you never feel the moment 'til it's passed (you never know it 'til it's gone, yeah)
Oh-oh
Time just keeps on ticking fast (you know?)
Know, there's danger in the lesson learned
Slow down before you crash and burn
Oh-oh (yeah)
Oh-oh (you know)
Better slow down before you crash and burn
