[Verse]
I got some questions, questions for you, c'mon, baby
I need some answers, answers from you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you do fighting for your life
And no one's on your side, yeah, baby
I can't stand to lose you, see you're in too deep
And know nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
What do you do?
Take a chance, chance, chance on your own, na-na-na-na-na
What do you do?
Take a chance, chance, chance on your own, yeah-yeah
What do you do? Do, oh yeah
What do you do?
I can see you, no disguise
You got that look up in your eye
You got that look up in your eye
It's a lining of disguise
You got that look up in your eye
You got that look up in your eye

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me, baby, what do you do fighting for your life
And no one's on your side, oh
I can't stand to lose you, see you're in too deep
And know nowhere to hide, I got a question

[Chorus]
What do you do?
Take a chance, chance, chance on your own, na-na-na-na-na
What do you do?
Take a chance, chance, chance on your own, yeah-yeah
What do you do? Do, oh yeah
What do you do?
It's a lining of disguise
You got that look up in your eye
You got that look up in your eye
It's a lining of disguise
You got that look up in your eye
You got that look up in your eye

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you do fighting for your life
And no one's on your side
I can't stand to lose you, see you're in too deep
And know nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
What do you do?
Take a chance, chance, chance on your own, na-na-na-na-na
What do you do?
Take a chance, chance, chance on your own, yeah-yeah
What do you do? Do, oh yeah
What do you do?
