You know what will happen when we connect right?
(Rock boy beats)
I let you know you worthy
Hitmaka
(That nigga Ladd got the juice, hoe) Ow!

[Chorus]
It's your birthday baby, whatcha wanna do?
Got some bitches, got some pretty bitches coming through
Know I said I never do it but I guess I lied
Roll a L, roll a L, fuck it, let's get high
It's your birthday baby, whatcha wanna do?
Got some bitches, got some pretty bitches coming through
Know I said I never do it but I guess I lied
Roll a L, pour that drank, fuck it, let's get right

[Verse 1]
Oooh, put your phone down while you're here with me
Oooh, we gon' 12 play like it's '93
Oooh, body calling, 'bout to bump and grind
Mmm, breakfast in bed, ain't no wine and dine
Oooh, and you know I'm bout my privacy
Oooh, don't tell nobody this shit but me
This shit I be into, only for you
Shit I be into, only for you

[Chorus]
It's your birthday baby, whatcha wanna do?
Got some bitches, got some pretty bitches coming through
Know I said I never do it but I guess I lied
Roll a L, roll a L, fuck it, let's get high
It's your birthday baby, whatcha wanna do?
Got some bitches, got some pretty bitches coming through
Know I said I never do it but I guess I lied
Roll a L, pour that drank, fuck it, let's get right

[Verse 2]
How it feel to be a winner?
Never a beginner, tell 'em I'm a pretty sinner
Birthday suit is what you have for dinner
Don't fight me, I'm a Pisces, birthday cake up on his white T
Turn downs unlikely, he checkin' for me like I'm Nike
No spaghetti, throw confetti, to the ceiling my Giuseppe's
Hey big head, you ready? I need that sloppy toppy every
Really want me run it, I'ma keep a hunnid
They make me sick to my stomach, they gotta pay me my homage
Just like my name is Muhammad, I'm bout to Trump em like Donald
Big Mac-ing I'm Ronald, you betta get at Tasana
I said these bitches is bums, they living off of they momma
But to tell you the truth, I ain't got nothing to prove
Bitches stealing sauce, I'm in first place
Come on eat this cake, it's your birthday

[Chorus]
It's your birthday baby, whatcha wanna do?
Got some bitches, got some pretty bitches coming through
Know I said I never do it but I guess I lied
Roll a L, roll a L, fuck it, let's get high
It's your birthday baby, whatcha wanna do?
Got some bitches, got some pretty bitches coming through
Know I said I never do it but I guess I lied
Roll a L, pour that drank, fuck it, let's get right

[Outro]
Let's get high baby
Let's get high baby
Let's get high baby
Ohh, ohh, ohh oh oh oh
Is you a Virgo, Sagittarius, Aquarius?
Cause I need some answers, Gemini or a Cancer babe?
Tell me baby baby, oh-woah
Hey, oh-woah, babe
Happy birthday
