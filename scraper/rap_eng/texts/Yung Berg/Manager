I ain't tryna be ya boyfriend, lemme manage ya

(Verse 1 - Yung Berg)
Yeah, these girls like me cause i show em somethin icy
Roll Somethin nicely
Make her wanna have a seed, Hope her son looks like me
Uh, can't imagine the things that i'm fightin
Collipark on the drums, i kno u gon like it
Chi-Town swag wit a A-Town bounce
Mix in all in together Watch a hit drop out
See we started from the kitchen, from the bed
To the couch
Gave her 45 minutes I was In
Then I'm Out
See my mama say i'm lucky
The hood say they love me
These girls (hate the part how i?) Put no one above me
See now i'm livin lovely
My Girl Gotta buddy
But she be trippin out because her girls wanna f**k me
And now we pullin up, see
Me and the boy Lloyd
Redbone (Girls)
Lambourghini (Toys)
Take it to tha flo, Cause i kno how to handle ya
I ont wanna be ya man i wanna be ya manager

(Chorus - Lloyd)
Kno i'm hot, let the top down if u burnin up
Speakers Knockin the block down wen we pullin up
I see you movin around on the dance floor
Baby watcha doin here watcha mad for
Shawty u jus dont kno wat u do to me
Gotta Playa open hopin u dont make a fool of me
Ya picture frame belongs inside of my camera
I ain't tryna be ya boyfriend lemme manage ya (she make me wanna say)

(Bridge)

(Verse 2)

Forget about ur boyfriend mami he's a amateur
There go the paparazzi smile for the camera (ahh)
Say cheese and throw up the YB'z (YB'z)
Body Picture perfect

Only for a small fee cause ur managed by me
Started wit (rosade?) then took it to Don P
Ran outta Don P so we vous (vecliz??)
See them otha dudes lose cause they ain't smoove like me
They don't coordinate the jewels wit the shoes like me
True Religion Jeans wit a v-neck fee
Make ya best friend say she want a dude like me (Like Meeee)
So we took em both to the beach (to the beach)
Me and the boy Lloyd (boy Lloyd) Threw em on Jet Skis (Skiiiis)

(Chorus - Lloyd)
Kno i'm hot, let the top down if u burnin up
