[Intro: Yung Berg]
Bro-bro-broke up with all my bitches
I got rich and then broke up with all my bitches
Hierarchy

[Chorus: Yung Berg]
Oh, we be gettin' money like it's '88 (like '88)
How many chains can my jeweler make? (You see it)
See that brand new Wraith, them Forgiatos skain' (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
How many hoes can a nigga take? (Woah)
Bro-bro-broke up with all my bitches
I got rich and then broke up with all my bitches (woah!)
Broke up with all my bitches
I-I-I got rich and then broke up with all my bitches (oh)

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
Since you know I'm rich (rich)
You know she wanna date me (date me)
Fucked her in L.A. (A)
That's California-cation ('cation)
Give a fuck what you thought (thought)
So many cars and so many gold (gold)
I fucked up a lot (lot)
Broke up, my fault, remember the code (code)

[Refrain: Jason Derulo]
Yeah! But I'm only gettin' richer, yeah
Paparazzi takin' pictures, yeah
It didn't shock me when she kissed her, yeah
I can't be trustin' all these hoes, no

[Chorus: Yung Berg]
Oh, we be gettin' money like it's '88 (like '88)
How many chains can my jeweler make? (You see it)

How many hoes can a nigga take? (Woah)
Bro-bro-broke up with all my bitches
I got rich and then broke up with all my bitches (woah!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm Weezy baby, no hard labor
I beat it up, I throw haymakers
And I ain't tryna be a heartbreaker
And that's word to the pacemakers
I'll shake her off like a salt shaker
If she ain't tryna be a team player
We could watch what we had go up in flames
That's cremation
I'm bein' patient when we embracin'
We just kick it 'til my knee in braces
But I close my eyes and start seein' faces
Of all the bitches that she replacin'
And my old hoes will be elated
To have the chance to be reinstated
And these new hoes will be elated
To have the chance to be my latest, and that's real

[Refrain: Jason Derulo & Lil Wayne]
Yeah! But I'm only gettin' richer, yeah (Tunechi)
Paparazzi takin' pictures, yeah (Mula, baby!)
It didn't shock me when she kissed her, yeah
I can't be trustin' all these hoes, no (all these, fuck these hoes)

[Chorus: Yung Berg & Lil Wayne]
Oh, we be gettin' money like it's '88 (like '88)
Man, fuck these hoes
How many chains can my jeweler make? (You see it)
Fuck these hoes
See that brand new Wraith, them Forgiatos skain' (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Fuck these hoes
How many hoes can a nigga take? (Woah)
I just fucked these hoes
Bro-bro-broke up with all my bitches
I just fucked these hoes
I got rich and then broke up with all my bitches (woah!)
I just fucked these hoes
Broke up with all my bitches
I just fucked these hoes
I-I-I got rich and then broke up with all my bitches (oh)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Uh, uh, send sexy pics to my phone, big daddy wish he was home (that's right)
Bubbles in my jacuzzis (that's right) just like we did out in Rome (that's right)
Took her shoppin' for Loub' (that's right), said the Berkin was better (that's right)
Suitcases full of black dollars (that's right), you know I'm workin' for cheddar (that's right)
Versace shoes and the robes (that's right), and fuck the expensive clothes (that's right)
When she lay on her back (that's right), I try to suck out her soul (that's right)
Make her shakin' and shiver (that's right), all these wonderful trembles (that's right)
Oh no, I can't be your man (oh, no), I'm just that one to remember (that's right)
We had a hell of a time (that's right), you left in time just for church (that's right)
Pray that you please say a prayer (that's right) for all my dawgs who do dirt (amen)
Hit my phone if you need me (that's right), I'm at the drop of a needle (that's right)
Hatin' on your G-Wagon (that's right), tell 'em you just copped the sequel, that's right
Roll with a boss (that's right), Jason Dinero (that's right)
We took a stroll through the mall and she got the set of stilettos
I got 'em

[Refrain: Jason Derulo & Rick Ross]
Yeah! (M-M-M, that's right)
But I'm only gettin' richer, yeah
(M-M)
Paparazzi takin' pictures, yeah
(Maybach Music)
It didn't shock me when she kissed her, yeah
I can't be trustin' all these hoes, no (M-M-M)

[Chorus: Yung Berg]
Oh, we be gettin' money like it's '88 (like '88)
How many chains can my jeweler make? (You see it)
See that brand new Wraith, them Forgiatos skain' (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
How many hoes can a nigga take? (Woah)
Bro-bro-broke up with all my bitches
I got rich and then broke up with all my bitches (woah!)
Broke up with all my bitches
I-I-I got rich and then broke up with all my bitches (oh)
