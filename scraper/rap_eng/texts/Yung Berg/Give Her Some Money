[Intro]
Hitmaka!
Head good, better give her some money
Pussy good, better give her some money
Attitude, give her some money
Give her some money

[Hook]
Head good, better give her some money
Pussy good, better give her some money
Attitude, give her some money
Give her some money
Drop low, give her some money
Dressing room, 'bout to get her some money
Give her some money
Bad bitch, better give her some money

[Verse 1]
Diddy boppin', pussy poppin'
On a handstand like a rocket
On my socket like a plug
Broke niggas, that's a dub
Stack it high on the low
Move a 100 how I roll
Keep it milly how I rock
In a booth on any block

[Pre-Hook]
I get it poppin', drop it wind it low
I'm with whatever who's gon' do the most
Then I celebrate it with a toast
Champagne with a 100 rose

[Hook]
Head good, better give her some money
Pussy good, better give her some money
Attitude, give her some money
Give her some money
Drop low, give her some money
Dressing room, 'bout to get her some money
Give her some money
Bad bitch, better give her some money

[Verse 2]
He throwin' bands, poppin' rubber bands, damn hey
He wanna dance so I hit him with the slow mo
He catchin' feelings then I'm outta here like "oh, no"
He ask me why then I told him he a bozo
I'm presidential then he came back with the rose gold
Took me shoppin', I'm like "eenie meenie money mo"
Now he askin' 'bout the road, bitch, I gotta go
My time is money, bitch, I gotta show

[Pre-Hook]
I get it poppin', drop it wind it low
I'm with whatever who's gon' do the most
Then I celebrate it with a toast
Champagne with a 100 rose

[Hook]
Head good, better give her some money
Pussy good, better give her some money
Attitude, give her some money
Give her some money
Drop low, give her some money
Dressing room, 'bout to get her some money
Give her some money
Bad bitch, better give her some money
