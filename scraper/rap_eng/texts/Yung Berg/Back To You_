[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
...for you
You ignore the things I say, I ever said
How could you make me fall for you? For you
And turn around and act like it wasn't lovin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Charlie Wilson]
Every time I get it
Every time I get it
Every time I get it
I, and I keep coming back to you
You blow my mind, baby, you
Girl, you know

[Verse: Chris Brown]
And she make me feel, girl, something (something)
Cruisin' nowadays, at my jail cell, had a deja vu
I used to buy you those shoes (yeah)
You know, Chanel, that new clutch (clutch)
Them fancy things, came out of love

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
...for you
You ignore the things I say, I ever said
How could you make me fall for you? For you
And turn around and act like it wasn't lovin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Charlie Wilson]
Every time I get it
Every time I get it
Every time I get it
I, and I keep coming back to you
You blow my mind, baby, you
Girl, you know
