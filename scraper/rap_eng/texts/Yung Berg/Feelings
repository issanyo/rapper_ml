[Intro]
Hitmaka!

[Chorus]
Lately I ain't been in my feelings
Nashe, I've been minding my business
Throw it in your face you gon' feel it
You're still stuck in the the past
I don't get mad, I get bags (big bags)
Pussy, best you done had
Now you won't get this back, no
Got a nigga acting

[Verse]
If that nigga acting up, put his ass out
If a nigga can't fuck, put his ass out
I ain't going back and forth with none of you bitches
Got his ass on a rope, now he tapped out
