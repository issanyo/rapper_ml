And deep in my heart, the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

Ohhh oh oh just a woman that knows how to respect herself, baby
Ohhh oh oh just a woman that knows how to respect herself, baby
How many times did I call your phone
Was I on your mind when you were alone
Oh baby, why you gotta treat me so bad
Said you love me and you want me and you need me
I was all you had

Sometimes I feel lust
Like you need someone other than me
Baby if there’s a doubt in your mind
I’m a good woman, I’m a good woman
Every man needs someone


Ohhh oh oh just a woman that knows how to respect herself, baby
Ohhh oh oh just a woman that knows how to respect herself, baby
