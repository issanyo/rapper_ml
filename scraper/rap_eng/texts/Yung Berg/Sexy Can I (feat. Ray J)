Sexy can I
Yeah, Yeahhh
All we wanna know is....
(Sexy can I)

[Chorus:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got ta play it like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, hit it from the front
Then I hit it from the back
Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then we shake that ass some more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got player it like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I

[Yung Berg:]
What up lil mama, it's ya boy Youngin
G5 dipped in louis vuitton luggage (ay)
Gotta love it, ya boy so fly
All the ladies go (ohhh) when a lot go by
Gucci on her feet, Marc Jacob on her thigh
She wanna ride or die with ya boy in the Chi
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince
Her boyfriend, she ain't missed him since

[Ray J:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got ta play it like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, keep it on the low
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the mo-mo
You can bring a friend, or you can ride solo
Let me get my camera, so we can take a photo
(ohh, ohh, ohh) Now go shawty, go shawty
Baby when we make love it's like, (Oh, ohh, ohh)

[Yung Berg]
(I don't know what your man is like but baby all I want to know is...sexy can
I

Sexy can I, visit you at work

While you sliding down the pole
No panties, no shirt
Then you climb back up the pole
Then you drop and do the splits
How you make that booty talk
Baby damn, u is da shit
(Oh, ohh, ohh) Now go shawty, go shawty
I make it rain in the club like (Oh, ohh, ohh)

[Yung Berg]
(I don't know what your man is like but baby all I want to know is...Sexy can I

Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got ta play it like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna no is, sexy can I

[Yung Berg:]
I don't care who's ya boy hittin, or who Ray Nella
So when I give it to her, i know that she ain't tellin'
See i'm a go getta and she a go getta
You already know she...
(Sexy can I)
Sexy can I send for you red-eye
Fresh out the pool no towel
Just let it air dry
And if you ain't f**kin' tonight
Man you can watch that tour bus go by

[Chorus:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got ta play like (oh baby)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna no is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, hit it from the front
Then I hit it from the back
Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then were back at it for more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got ta play it like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna no is, sexy can I
