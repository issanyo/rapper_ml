[Intro]
Hitmaka!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
She about the looty, so I told her how to do me
And I threw it on her booty, yeah, yeah
Pocket full of racks, tell her spend it at Saks
I just threw it on her back, yeah, yeah
She brought a buddy 'round with some
Afterparty, know I'm tryna freak some, yeah
Brought the Dom if you tryna pop some
If it ain't that pussy, pop something
Pop something, yeah
Drop something, yeah
[?] going up, make 'em drop something
I could spend it all, when your rent due?
I'ma throw my last and I'ma get it back

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Said she wanna drink, wanna pop something
