Tryin to keep it 100
You know was never my woman
You know was never getting married
You know we was  really just fucking
Tell me why you trippin?
Why you buggin?
Beat it up , i don't own you nothing
I was fucking you
You was fucking others,alright

Why you actin like you never knew?
Girl when you knew
And its a feel of attraction
Can't say I didn't let you choose
It was all on you

It ain't my fault
Now you all on me
It ain't my fault
Got a couple of bad bitches on me
It ain't my fault
Can't say I ain't keep it G

Eh, damn she fly
But she could never be my down
I tried to keep it one hundred
You know you was never my woman
You ain't never hit the club with a bag full of money
Threw the keys at valet
And told them keep the car runnin'
My girl, have you seen her?
Mila J, she look like Aaliyah

Never said that sex was way passed where she flows
Like Katrina
And when were down , nigga 305

It ain't my fault
Now you layin on me
It ain't my fault
Got a couple of bad bitches on me
It ain't my fault
Can't say I ain't keep it G

Now you all on me
It ain't my fault
Got a couple of bad bitches on me

Why you actin like you never knew?
Girl when you knew
And its a feel of attraction
Can't say I didn't let you choose
It was all on you

And you know I have Brenda,Alisha ,Linda,Fatima
Remember Dan used to work at the cheater
Do she want me or my sister Anica
But she ain't never met Nicky
