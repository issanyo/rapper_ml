[Verse 1]
Been so long to even lie and I ain't tryin to keep up
I got lost in all that talking and now I'm bouncin' pieces up
Had your chance and then you lost it, you was flossin' in my truck
Like it was yours, all them whores that you so caught-caught-caught up

[Pre-Hook]
Now that you're gone, it's easy to see
Everything he was doing to me
How long you think it would be
Before I saw in HD
Oh (oh-oh), I'm taking the key back
Everything you've given to me
Well, that's mine but you gotta leave
'Cause I see in HD

[Hook]
Hey hey hey, oh oh oh-oh
Hey hey hey, oh oh oh-oh
(I see in HD)
HD, HD, see you in high definition
You can't play me
See you in high definition

[Verse 2]
You've been callin' and I'm ignorin'
There's nothin' to talk about
Why you stalkin', boy quit jockin' and poppin' up at my house
I can't help it if you can't get nobody as fly as I
Shoulda thought of that before, put your shit out the door

[Pre-Hook]
Now that you're gone, it's easy to see
Everything he was doing to me
How long you think it would be
Before I saw in HD
Oh (oh-oh), I'm taking the key back
Everything you've given to me
Well, that's mine but you gotta leave
'Cause I see in HD

[Hook]
Hey hey hey, oh oh oh-oh
Hey hey hey, oh oh oh-oh
(I see in HD)
HD, HD, see you in high definition
You can't play me
See you in high definition

[Bridge]
So high, so high definition
So high, so high definition
Tired of all the checkin' upon me
When I was stayin' you never did want me
Now that I'm gone that's how you actin'
Just like a girl, yea, like a girl, yea
So high, so high, so high definition
So high, so high definition

[Verse 1]
Been so long to even lie and I ain't tryin to keep up
I got lost in all that talking and now I'm bouncin' pieces up

[Bridge]
So high, so high definition
So high, so high definition
Tired of all the checkin' upon me

So high, so high, so high definition
So high, so high definition

Hey hey hey, oh oh oh-oh
Hey hey hey, oh oh oh-oh
HD, HD, see you in high definition
You can't play me
See you in high definition
