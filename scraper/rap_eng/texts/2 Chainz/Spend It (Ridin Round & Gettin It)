I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, I'm ridin round and Im gettin it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, I'm ridin round and Im gettin it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it

I am smoking on exotic , my girl ain't got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I asked her sf she working, she asked me do I want it
I say when went to school b*tch money was the subject ..

Chorus:
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, I'm ridin round and Im gettin it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, I'm ridin round and Im gettin it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it

I'm ridin round my side of town , boxing gloves
I beat the trial, I had the coke, I had a smile
I had a coat for every style, crocodile the gator type
I'm allergic to the hater type, i'll take ya wife ,give her back
9 months after that SIMILAC ! similar to sayin mama's baby daddy's maybe uhh
W-when we had sex I was in the Mercedes
And I ain't crazy but if that's my baby
Then we gonna have name the lil baby Mercedes
The money that I makin I don't see ya like im blind
I rather spend money baby I don't spend time
My pocket's on full and so is my gas tank and all my cars got
Gas in the ash tray

Chorus:
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, I'm ridin round and Im gettin it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, I'm ridin round and Im gettin it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin round and Im gettin it

Foe toe ready my polo out the cleaners im the the perfect definition
Of something you've never seen of, Maserati kawasaki bought my girl a beamer
The jewelry I got on is matchin with the tequila, Patron , margaritas, double for my diva's
I bring all my guns to work , gilbert arenas
Plus I'm killin features and I'm killin shows
I should have sex in the coffin' cause I'm killin these hoes
Fufillin these goals, climbin up the ladder, shoot yo ass down you know I rep Atlanta , Southside !
I'm ridin around stuntin, smokin loud in public, talkin loud in public, yeah my entourage is bucket

[Chorus:]
