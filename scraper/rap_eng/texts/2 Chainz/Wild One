[Chorus: MeetSims]
I gave my life, my heart, my soul to you motherfuckers
How you gonna hate on me?
These sticks, these stones be with my bones
I swear I'll burn this motherfucker to the ground
[?] to turn your back on me
Fucking with a wild, wild one

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm captivatin' the bitches, gold flow in my veins
In my Yeezy Adidas and I'm still running from fame
A lot of men to recover, a lot of money to gain
Double M in this bitch, like Troy Ave I'ma bang
Double park my Carrera, ever step, that's an error
Go to war for dinero, you better get on my level
He lost his crib to the bank, while I'm swimming in dank
Lessons learned in life, nigga you give or you take
She swallowed me on the first, still a hundred a verse
That boy shells in the heat cause my last season was the worst
Pat Riley of rap, all my niggas got rings
Or at least a Ferrari, they need police on the scene

[Chorus: MeetSims]
I gave my life, my heart, my soul to you motherfuckers
How you gonna hate on me?
These sticks, these stones be with my bones
I swear I'll burn this motherfucker to the ground
[?] to turn your back on me
Fucking with a wild, wild one

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I did it for the streets with my mama in mind
I had sex with a twin, had the other one crying
Our time is divine, I recline or retire
I ain't tired of the grind, I'm just tired of you lying
Told my bitch "I got your back," tat my name on her spine
Got my hand on her ass, Givenchy's on the gas
Got semis in the dash, I got a van full of ballers like a soccer dad
I just had to laugh
1-50 in reverse and I know not to crash
If I roll my own joints, then I'm not gon' pass
I'm getting more paper, I need to get me more haters
I got things bling and this flavor, got this shit looking like Vegas

[Chorus: MeetSims]
I gave my life, my heart, my soul to you motherfuckers
How you gonna hate on me?
These sticks, these stones be with my bones
I swear I'll burn this motherfucker to the ground
[?] to turn your back on me
Fucking with a wild, wild one

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
How you feel? I don't give a fuck
Love to tell a bitch nigga no
Pussy nigga get it out the mud
Multi-platinum, think I'm going gold
Phone ringin', put 'em on hold
Grinding, tryna keep it in road
Deal with shit that you'll never know
By the rules, sticking to the code
Fast cars, status in the game
Got a reputation with the name
Passed the lane, I just want the change
Rappers lame, niggas want the fame
Get out of the way, bitches say I changed
Love the Range, that'll probly change
Run upon me when you think I am slipping
Big shit gripper, I ain't timid
Brinks bricks break'em real simple
You would think I'm talking recompressed
Big bitch always giving mention
Feel a way to get it off your chest
G Shock watch tell the time
These blocks over here is mine
Crap in the barrel ass nigga
Grab at ya while you tryna climb

[Chorus: MeetSims]
I gave my life, my heart, my soul to you motherfuckers
How you gonna hate on me?
These sticks, these stones be with my bones
I swear I'll burn this motherfucker to the ground
[?] to turn your back on me
Fucking with a wild, wild one
