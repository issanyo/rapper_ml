[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Let 'em watch, keep staring
Hatin' all the things we do
Tryin' to knock us off our cloud
They got all eyes on us
Wishing they had what we got
So sing like no one's around
And dance like your mama ain't proud (proud, proud, proud)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Drop down do the hokey-pokey
She ain't even down for the okey-dokey
Notice we, the coldest team
Is on the scene, I'm born to lead
I don't even sleep long enough to have a dream
Reality, unfortunate
Girls hanging on me like ornaments
And I play the game like a tournament
I'm tryin' to win stomping in my all black teams

[Pre-Chorus 1: Guy Sebastian]
Drop crotch, snap back, black leather back pack
White shirt down to my knees
They can judge our shoes but not our moves
We ain't got no one to please

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Let 'em watch, keep staring
Hatin' all the things we do
Tryin' to knock us off our cloud
They got all eyes on us
Wishing they had what we got
So sing like no one's around
And dance like your mama ain't proud (proud, proud, proud)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Make your knees touch your elbow
Have me stick it to em like Velcro
Stickin' straight up like scarecrow
Shoulda see the pic she sent to my cell phone
X-rated, don't hate it
Gold plated, motivated, been getting to it since I graduated
Hate but chase her, porn out, lookin' in for the hole man to taste her
When she left I had a whole pillow full of make up

[Pre-Chorus 2: Guy Sebastian]
High waist, crop top, red lips, top shot
Fresh tatt, holes at the knees
They can judge our shoes but not our moves
We ain't got no one to please, yeah

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Let 'em watch, keep staring
Hatin' all the things we do
Tryin' to knock us off our cloud, yeah
They got all eyes on us
Wishing they had what we got
So sing like no one's around
And dance!

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian]
Dance how you wanna (how you wanna)
Love who you wanna (who you wanna)
Dance how you wanna, how you wanna
Love who you wanna, who you wanna
Be who you wanna, who you wanna
Yeah, who you wanna
Dance like your mama ain't proud
Yeah, yeah
Like your mama ain't proud
Like your mama ain't proud
Like your mama, your mama, your mama

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Let 'em watch, keep staring
Hatin' all the things we do
Tryin' to knock us off our cloud
They got all eyes on us
Wishing they had what we got
So sing like no one's around
And dance like your mama ain't proud
