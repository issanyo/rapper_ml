[Verse 1: Victor Oladipo]
You ain't never been where I been, you can't tell me what I saw
All I know is I'm the coldest
I've been through so much, feel like I'm ready for war
And I will fight until the end because I know what I'm fighting for

[Chorus: Victor Oladipo]
So wave your flags, you don't want no smoke
'Cause everything you got still won't come close
I came into this world with my back against the ropes
So watch this footwork it's the rope a dope

[Verse 2: Victor Oladipo]
If I fall I get up again
If I lose somehow still I win
Even in defeat it's a lesson learned
'Cause everything I got is everything I earned
Set a goal, plan it out
Look at how it panned out
Did it with no handouts
Mama I'm the man now
Look at me I'm number one
And look at you, you made a champion
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Victor Oladipo]
So wave your flags, you don't want no smoke
'Cause everything you got still won't come close
I came into this world with my back against the ropes
So watch this footwork it's the rope a dope

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Pledge allegiance on one knee
Shoes Crocodile Dundee
Attire on the highest level
Go to war with a giant devil
Slingshot with a rock in it
Foreign car with that park in it
You ain't never been treated different
Just because you a [?]
[?] gotta lot to say
Even work on the holidays
Knock on your door like Halloween
Mask on like trick or treat
I ain't worried about them picking me
Throw you up to the 5th degree
I been high since Snoop Dogg said "fo shiggity"
That's consistency

[Chrous: Victor Oladipo]
So wave your flags, you don't want no smoke
'Cause everything you got still won't come close
I came into this world with my back against the ropes
So watch this footwork it's the rope a dope

[Bridge: Victor Oladipo]
Instead of hanging with you back on the wall
Stand up, just get involved
'Cause together, everyone will achieve more
If you pass out, I'll be pushing you further and harder than ever before
There ain't no I in team, so ain't no giving up

[Chrous: Victor Oladipo]
So wave your flags, you don't want no smoke
'Cause everything you got still won't come close
I came into this world with my back against the ropes
So watch this footwork it's the rope a dope
