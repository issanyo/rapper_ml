[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Between me and you I'm gettin' money too
Between me and you I'm gettin' money too
Between me and you I'm gettin' money too
Between me and you I'm gettin' money too

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
5 in the morning, feds at my door
Early in the morning layin' with my ho
Came in my crib couldn't find a gram I told them cops suck this [?]
And be out here, scram
Tell you a lil story about a lesson I learned
Never leave the crib without packin' a gun
Niggas talk bout me but they fluently wrong
Cause I came from the block get my [?] on
Niggas keep askin' me what Luda be on
Cause Tity spit fire like a fucking dragon
Brag on, drag off, if I'm on, you not
You are, I'm the opposite of soft
Came from the corner keepin' chickens in my loft
I got alotta bitches but I love my Nina Ross
And how could I forget how [?]
A foreign car ridin', Hemis make me cough

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
Hold up wait a minute let me roll my sleeves up
Hold up wait a minute let me roll weed up
Hold up wait a minute let me pour my lean up
Hold up wait a minute let that between us

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Between me and you I'm gettin' money too
Between me and you I'm gettin' money too
Between me and you I'm gettin' money too
Between me and you I'm gettin' money too

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
I came in, lookin' to win, so drop 'em off
When the birds packed up for the winter, they flyin' south
Sleeves rolled up when I'm whippin' that yola
Stayin' real in the field like a US soldier
Make it quick, spin it fast
Hustle hard,  make it last
Married to this dirty cash
Shift the gear and press the gas
Imma show you what it do
This between me and you
Gucci belt and gucci shoe, Texas gettin' money too
Twist it up and smoke
Haters out here ridin' broke
I'm ridin' high and leavin' fly
Boys out here losin' hope
Miss me with foul play
Comin' down y'all way
Yeah we gettin' money too on the grind all day

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
Hold up wait a minute let me roll my sleeves up
Hold up wait a minute let me roll weed up
Hold up wait a minute let me pour my lean up
Hold up wait a minute let that between us

Between me and you I'm gettin' money too
