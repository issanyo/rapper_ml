[Intro]
Uh let me get a caesar salad, please, with croutons and codeine dressing, and a diet codeine. On a codeine diet. I get all that shit, I get back on that shit

[Hook]
When I get out the bed, I grind, I hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Did it before and I'll do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Do it again

[Verse 1]
Been 'posed to stop drinkin'
Pocket full of Ben Franklins
Y'all niggas been hatin'
Balmain mixtape
Surround the booth with yellow tape
Zip the kush then meditate
Your ladder straight, you featherweight
You heavyweight, it's Saturday
Gladiator, tell your neighbor
Gun on table, Buick LeSabre
Do you now, do you later
Dice game, pool table
Two flavors, too anxious
Got to kill these niggas
I don't feel these niggas
Them some stealin' niggas
Them lil' bitty niggas
On Peter St. at my buildin'
Nigga, Keisha's daycare was half a million, nigga

[Hook]
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Did it before and I'll do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before

[Verse 2]
Fell off, came up
Fell off, came back up
Pulled a doolie in Magic parkin' lot
Came back up
Go to the door, don't get searched
Don't have to pay
Walk in, get ones, order wings
Nigga, this the A
AP, Hublot, Patek, Rollie, gold teeth
Niggas stealin' so much sauce
Them niggas damn near stole me
They stole the swag and they stole my license
You don't know about my sacrifices
Today I worked out on my triceps
Bought a room just to shoot dice in
Whip same color Cicely Tyson
Smokin' gas one of my original vices
Made a mil' off my phone devices
Listen to your own advices
I'm laid up, but I'm prayed up
You a handful, you a A cup
Might rock a jersey and a Jacob
Y'all young niggas need to wake up

[Hook]
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Get out the bed and grind and hustle
Did it before and I'll do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before, I'ma do it again
Did it before
