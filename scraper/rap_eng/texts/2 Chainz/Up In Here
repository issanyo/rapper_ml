Bottles poppin, models watching
Tell the Dj play my song now the club rockin
Haters watching, yeah we see your haters
We done ran outta bottles, someone call the waiter
We up in here, we up in here
We up in here, we up in here, yeah we up in here
We up in here, we up in here
We up in here, we up in here, yeah we up in here

Pull up to the club, its show time
Got my team with me its go time
We walk straight through da line with no hesitation
We got bottles everywhere, its a celebration
Models to the right bouncers to the left
We’re ruling in this b*tch I got to thank myself
All in V.I.P., I know you notice me
Hundred thousand work with juries is all over me
Haters in the crowd I see you watching us
But we’re steady making moves ain’t no stopping us
We’re on top ain’t no better feeling
And if you get it to the money throw it to the ceiling

Chorus:
Bottles poppin, models watching
Tell the Dj play my song out da club rockin
Hater watching, well we see you hate
We done ran out of bottles, someone call the waiter
We up in here, we up in here
We up in here, we up in here, yeah we up in here
We up in here, we up in here
We up in here, we up in here, yeah we up in here

They say I run the streets I said I’m just joggin. Bought a foreclosed home, use for a closet
If she fuck me good I’ma take her shoppin
I have your pussy wet ‘cause I like moppin
Got her name in my phone under boo 2
And if my main lady find out, it's gonna be boo hoo
Cry me a river like it was Timberlake
Let me see your hands if you get head on the Interstate
Turn the playfield around fools
I feed my girl maui maui til until she can’t move
And my applause? is the equivalent to Cancun and I’m the shit, I should record in the bathroom
