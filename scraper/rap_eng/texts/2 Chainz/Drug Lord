[Intro: Red Cafe]
Drug lord
They're calling me a drug lord
(Brooklyn, Flatbush)
Drug lord
(2007)
Look
(ShakeDown)

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Cash, cash, I gets hella cash
Shawty don't judge me, I might fuck you fast
Then get out of Dodge, hop in my Dodge
Camaro, Fidel Castro, look
Cocaine connect, now what I'm known as
Believe I dropped a few burbs, where your zone at?
Believe I push hella pounds where your town at
And bet I press the chopper right where your frown at

What your life like? Nigga, mine real
That Rollie you wearin' foolery, nigga, mine real
I'm selling narcotics, so you know how come
I'm still balling on niggas without an album
I ain't out here preachin' like if I'm Malcom
I'm hella dirty in these streets, 730
ShakeDown, bitch, smoke till my lungs black
Only question I ask, "Fuck is my one's at?"
Fuck what these hoes doing, fuck who these hoes screwing
Put that ho in the street, let's get this dough moving
I slam Cadillac doors, whip, whip city then ice that crack gold

[Hook: Red Cafe]
Hello, hello, I'm mean, motherfucker
Hello, hello, I'm mean, motherfucker
Hello, hello, I'm mean, motherfucker
I know they wanna be me, motherfucker
Hello, hello, I'm mean, motherfucker
Hello, hello, I'm mean, motherfucker (2 Chainz)
Hello, hello, I'm mean, motherfucker (Hello)
I know they wanna be me, motherfucker (yeaaaah)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Hair weave kill 'em, rearrange her hairdo
I'm motherfuckin' real and that just ain't you
I'm up on appeal for killing the Pro Tools
And niggas know my religion is tru
Horseshoes, curfew niggas, consort with killers
Lil' niggas is gassed up, it's time to burp you, niggas
See, every day is a weekend, we spend
Money on the strong pack, you niggas is weaklin's
Catch me on one, two, five and the wheat Timbs
Gucci hoodie on, look like a tall-ass Rakim
I'm a dread-head, rocking with the redhead
I'm from College Park where the feds tap a dead cell
Smoke Cool Js, back-to-back LL
You need clientele just so you can rock bail
Yeah, used to trap by a school zone
ATL, I had crack in my school clothes
Got into it with my car until the roof gone
Catch up, you too far back in the Grey Poupon
They say I'm a hoodlum in some new clothes
Hello, goodbye, I need some new hoes

[Hook]
