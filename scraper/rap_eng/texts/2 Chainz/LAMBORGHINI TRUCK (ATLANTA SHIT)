[Intro]
Yeah, deuce
Atlanta shit, uh, Atlanta
Atlanta shit

[Verse 1]
Atlanta shit, I'm a fashion lover
Virgil Abloh did my first album cover
Got my first plaque with Mike Will
Nigga, I don't sleep, no NyQuil
Used to sin to pay the bills in my habitat
They don't ask where you from when you on a jet
Back END, pick her up, I know you heard about it
Got a bag from 2012, I ain't never count it
I let Rico Wade hear my last album
Then them boys in the dungeon, ain't no band wagon
Man, I looked up to Dre, he my fuckin' favorite
And Yung Joc still owe me a lil' paper
Served Big Gipp and Cee-Lo, lethal
I was mobile, they was peephole, but we was equal
We were trappin', they were rappin'
That's why I fuck with Dolla, he was always snappin'
Started from apartments, ended in a mansion
That's the definition of growth and expansion
A slope and a ramp and a envelope full of hope
She gon' lick the stamp and I'm the main attraction
Lamborghini fast and I'm too tall for that shit
I tried to get in, I had to crawl in that bitch
But they 'bout to make a truck so I'ma call 'em
Ask 'em, "How many y'all gettin'? I want all of 'em"

[Chorus]
Lamborghini truck, Lamborghini truck
Lamborghini truck, Lambo, Lamborghini truck
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)

[Bridge]
Lamborghini truck (never givin' up)
Lamborghini what? (never givin' up)
Lamborghini who? (never givin' up)
Lamborghini bust (never givin' up)

[Verse 2]
Panini with the crust (never givin' up)
Gianni on the tux (never givin' up)
Money on the other side (never givin' up)
In God We Trust (In God We Trust)
Killer Mike from Adamsville (Mike)
Fam Goon from the Bluff (from the Bluff)
Where you from? Where you rode the bus? (bus)
Yeah, them Migos from the North (Migos)
And I'm like the Snowman when I'm holdin' on a fork (skrrt)
And I'm like Dro when I'm rockin' Polo Sport
I feel like Gucci when I'm walkin' out of court
Rest in peace Lo, rest in peace Bankroll
One time for Rocko, Tip, and Roscoe
One of the top flows, on the top floor
Get it wholesale like Costco
You know I got that glow, Bruce LeRoy
As far as the rappers, I'm startin' to eat more
2 Chainz

[Chorus]
Lamborghini truck, Lamborghini truck
Lamborghini truck, Lambo, Lamborghini truck
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Nigga, I remember when Baby D was in BMF
Fuck y'all niggas
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Atlanta shit
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
Nigga, the whole Atlanta gonna have a Lambo truck, nigga
You know how we do, gettin' a bag down here, nigga
Lamborghini truck (Lamborghini truck)
