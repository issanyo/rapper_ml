Im infatuated with money and the hoes
So many tattoos im worth more than you niggas in ?drawers?
This is not a boxer this a four door, car so cold man you need to wear a fur coat
Four zips pole got me walking round slow-mo
Everyone saying you should have went solo
But they dont really no though
This is how we do it
Steal from the rich bring back it to the hood
Quarter pound of good, got my tour bus musty
Polo rugby your ho go'n rub me
If i was you man i wouldn't trust me
All this plain around made your ho fuck me
