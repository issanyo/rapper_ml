[Intro]
Let me teach you how to really stunt

[Verse 1 : Jallal]
Nigga I done made it
Yall just stay hating
Yall were too jaded
Way to complacent
Dont be naive yeah
You don't know Mowii
Made the cat daddy
I was in the 60s
Not around palm trees
It was all concrete
You can not believe
You can't just get up leave
Niggas are still in the streets
Ain't got no time to grieve
My flow so clean
Yall just deceive

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta mess with me Im just made out of love
I don't need your energy when push comes to shove
I do this for my family they got me man for life
Just to say Im timid I just don't even reply

You ain't gotta mess with me Im just made out of love
I don't need your energy when push comes to shove
I do this for my family they got me man for life
Just to say Im timid I just don't even reply

[Verse 2 : Jallal]
Did it all with prayer
Did it for my haters
Knew God was Greater
Thank me now and later
Man I been this great
Yall just been so late
Never miss my old days
No friends like Cast Away
Captain Jack nigga parlay
With me and Chainz its a party
In the club nigga hardly
I only do what Allah say
Bless me for I sneeze
Yeah I made it from the streets
Im what you wanna be
Yall will never get the keys

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta mess with me Im just made out of love
I don't need your energy when push comes to shove
I do this for my family they got me man for life
Just to say Im timid I just don't even reply

You ain't gotta mess with me Im just made out of love
I don't need your energy when push comes to shove
I do this for my family they got me man for life
Just to say Im timid I just don't even reply

[Verse 3 : 2 Chainz]
Do it for A town
Do it for Southside
Catch me in a coupe
I tell em who are you
And ain't shit changed nigga
SEVIIN
My religion is my prescription
Thank God
I said you an ill nigga with vision
Tell em
I do it for all colors nigga all colors
Lets Get it my nigga Lets Pray
Jallal

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta mess with me Im just made out of love
I don't need your energy when push comes to shove
I do this for my family they got me man for life
Just to say Im timid I just don't even reply

You ain't gotta mess with me Im just made out of love
I don't need your energy when push comes to shove
I do this for my family they got me man for life
Just to say Im timid I just don't even reply
