[Intro: DJ Self]
Dj Self, the prince of New York
As we continue to keep it quinning

[Verse 1]
From the Jets to the jet
From the nigga in the cut
To the one cutting cheques
So who’s the one cutting cheques
You know acid reflux
I had to throw that shit up and then
Straight out the alley way
Flipped the long cheque and ran off on Sallie Mae
Paddy cake, paddy cake
I’m from where you either own dust or got allergies
Playin’ polo, white tee, ho beater under that
With some hoes up under me
And the watch cost a quarter, keep
My music on and I’m a beast, these shoes on that aren't released
But soon as I got back, I pull right up in five flat
And he was not that
Might peel your top back
Pop that, you don’t need a car to get carjacked
Dump the ashes at the red light
Just left the barbecue, me and two red dykes
And you knowing what they saying, right?
What’s that?
That nigga luckier than a motherfucker

[Hook]
I gotta get away
Fuck that, never let nobody take me out my zone
You try me or something?
With no remorse, four door Porsche
New crib by the golf course
Fuck that, never let nobody take me out my zone
You try me or something?
With no remorse, four door Porsche
New crib by the golf course, nigga

[Verse 2]
Back yard full of golf balls
Grandma crib use to smell like moth balls
I used to pray that they would pop off
Hand tossed in, drop off at the drop off
Programmed to be great
In a Caddy Brougham with my name on the seats
I used to pray till I was sleep
When it was cold I used to have to use my coat for a sheet
The oven for the heat
The dude that used to work on the plum and used to geek
Your whole style is obsolete
They say that money talk that's why you niggas never speak
And I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Fuck around and give life for the aggravated flicks
Cyber dust if you are textin’
They'll take that shit to trial
And I done killed it in Giuseppe
I thank God for the blessin’
Then I look in the mirror, thank God for the freshness
And I came up from nothin’
(So what you saying?)
It ain’t nothin’ but a comma

[Hook]
