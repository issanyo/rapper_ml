[Hook: 2 Chainz]
First I get some money, then I pop a tag
First I get some money, then I pop them tags
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Ok I done figured it out, I know what you niggas about
We slanging narcotics, you know that we got it
There’s never ever a drought
My partner just did a whole decade
I just put the beam on the AK
I jumped in the air fuck what you usin' young nigga
I’m busting, you ducking and moving
She sucking and fucking, I do it
I do it, I do it, I do it
Put that bitch right on the wood
I’m taking it back like a starter
They busting like mortar, they busting the hollow
She model, she swallow
That sperm like it’s water
Everything on Forgiatos
You knowing I’m getting it like no tomorrow
Got 50 niggas from Chicago ready to crack your taco
Whip a brick like I whip an auto
Just made a juug at McDonalds
Just bought me ten cars, no car note
Only thing I dodge is potholes, clap bitch your ass with no bravo

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
First I get some money, then I pop a tag
First I get some money, then I pop them tags
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands

[Verse 2: Skooly]
Fifteen, suddenly I want to sing
Sixteen, fucking hoes, selling drink
I started sipping, got addicted just like nicotine
Such a fiend, not just for lean, for these fucking B’s
Although I lean, I smoke Irene like I’ve got a disease
Oh yeah I rap and sing, don’t you know I rap and sing
And in my hood and what I’ve seen
You probably wouldn’t last a week
And in my hood the good never outweigh the bad
Don’t be mad at me
Somebody call the pastor please, a young nigga killing shit
Young nigga killing shit
She want to hear me sing like Marvin
I turn the bitch gay no Marvin
And I'll probably leave a bitch starving
Cause I really do be illin' though
When I get to flowing I can’t stop going
A young nigga poppin' like I got dropped on the skillet

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
First I get some money, then I pop a tag
First I get some money, then I pop them tags
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands

[Verse 3: Cap 1]
First I get this money, then I pop them bands
Shawty say she want to pop the pussy
I’m just blowing money like a fan
Got them gold bar shoes cost a band
Got the molly and I sell it by the gram
Got some bitches that's for it, niggas steady getting naked
I done fell asleep when I was on a Xan
Imma treat her like a dog, I’m a dog
In the kitchen water whipping with the fork
In the club tryna order 100 bottles
I done came a long way from that Impala
So I’m balling like I’ve never seen tomorrow
Shawty want to hit me in the head like a boxer
Niggas ain’t real, they imposters
I’m just sitting back eating pasta
I just ordered shrimp with the lobster
Fucking up the [?] in the mall, popping tags
One call put them killers on your ass
Got gas, need 34 hundred for the bag
Mason Margiellas and the PIPs
When I pull out that weed I say I’m outcha league
Got them foreign vehicles that don’t take a key
Bitches on my line, I can’t get no sleep

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
First I get some money, then I pop a tag
First I get some money, then I pop them tags
If I can’t sleep, Imma pop a xan
Then I get some money, Imma pop them bands
