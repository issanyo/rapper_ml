[Intro]
Yeah man, you know
I just gotta get this shit off my chest, I do, I do
I'm tired of it, I'm sayin' this shit all the time
Like niggas takin' the style, niggas takin' everything a nigga do
I'm 'bout to get an alarm for my shit
Nigga get close to my shit, I'm puttin' a chirp on that shit
Shit gon' go off on niggas
Brr brr! You dig what I'm sayin'?

[Hook]
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to take my bag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr

[Verse 1]
I got Bloods in Savannah
I got Crips on Old National
On your ho like a fashion
Pinky ring on Alaska
Illest nigga in Nebraska
Nigga fake like wrastlin'
Got cash or plastic
Big cash, cappin'
Six Flags, lotta rides
Turn the beat to a homicide
Microphone look mortified
Lyrical bullets is a .45
I'm doin' 75 on the 75
85 off of 85
200 on 285
None of my cars take 89
Down to get money any time
Life a bitch with no panty line
Us versus the other squad
Stash spot is my boxer shorts
Just stickin' to the protocol
Weed smellin' like underarm
Turn you suckers into bubblegum

[Hook]
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to take my bag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr

[Verse 2]
I just might stand on the car
Stand on the wall
Logos on my bag
Logo on my scarf
Yeah I met her tonight
Fuck her tomorrow
You know how we are
You know who we are
Yeah the trap is my workplace
You know I came from a hurt place
Had to reverse it to first place
To father, hustler in first place
And I said word for word
I usually smoke at work
I either smirk or flirt
Took it from hard to vert
I got some word to off
Them bitches bumpin' soft
Young niggas stealin' sauce
I'm tryna drill 'em off
I'm tryna kill this off
I bring the women out
I'm 'bout to build a house
Then I'ma rent it out, woah!

[Hook]
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to take my bag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr

[Outro]
You already know that's me though, stay drenched
Every time you see me, I'm drenched
I'm the freshest nigga in the room, you dig what I'm sayin'?
I'm soaked, uh
We gon' need some wet floor signs in here, people, please
It's the drench god, we don't want nobody to fall
Slip up on this sauce, mane
