[Intro]
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Jump, jump, jump, jump

[Verse 1 - Tinie Tempah]
Eenie meanie minie, thank God it's Friday
Please don't ask me for my ID if I'm in your iTunes library
Got my own book in my library, my mansion is so tidy
My neighbours hate my mistress cause she never wear no nighties
I go Claridges to do high tea, Jordan's on like Spike Lee
I'm high end, you're High Street, swagger jacking my stylee
When I was a kid I used to save up for my Nikes
Now all these little kids is tryna save up for my Nikes (Go)

[Hook - Tinie Tempah]
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake (Tambourine)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump (Trampoline)

[Verse 2 - Tinie Tempah]
Sharing clothes, that's trampy, splitting bills, that's trampy
All this hanky panky, now her hand prints on my Banksy
I'm just strictly speaking, Anne Frankly, all my girls is fancy
In a white Ferrari Spider, rolling with Anansi
And Diplo to disco, I – she sniff, whoa
She gwan like she RiRi, and wine to Calypso
She ask me if I'm single, I said "Maybe, I think so
I can't concentrate, when that thong's on like Sisqo"

[Hook -Tinie Tempah]
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake(Tambourine)
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump (Trampoline)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
First of all I'm swagging, two girls with me so I'm bragging
So much money in my pocket, my pants might be sagging
My car might be tinted, my weed might be scented
My girl might be bow legged, her friend might be with her
Gold Roley on when I perform, ring-ring – mobile phone
The way it's going off, it must be on
'til the break of dawn, party like rock stars
We don't stop 'til we see the fucking cop cars

[Bridge - Tinie Tempah]
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake (Tambourine)
Tan 'til her skin peel off, tangerine
Then she Vogue, then she Vogue, Agyness Deyn
On your marks get set go red, amber, green

[Outro]
Sydney, what's going down? New York, what's going down?
LA, what's going down? Vegas, what's going down?
Dublin, what's going down? Paris, what's going down?
Lagos, what's going down? Oslo, what's going down?
Toronto, what's going down? Stockholm, what's going down?
Berlin, what's going down? Johannesburg, what's going down?
Tokyo, what's going down? Rio, what's going down?
Beijing, what's going down? London, what's going down?
