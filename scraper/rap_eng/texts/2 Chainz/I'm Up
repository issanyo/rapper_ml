[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm up (x16)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm hands on like a iPad (iPad)
Them racks in my pants look like thigh pads (thigh pads)
I hit it with the fork, that's my dance (scur!)
I hit it two times, that's a slow dance (scur scur!)
I ain't got time for the romance
Cocaine avalanche when I finance
I'mma laugh at ya, I'mma throw a bomb at ya
Since you a crumb snatcher I'mma throw a crumb at ya
I ain't mad at ya, but ya got me bent backwards
I roll another swisher, I don't like to smoke Backwoods
Brick Squad bandana fool, trapped out since grammar school
Brick Squad Atlanta crew, she got a bandana too

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yea I got that fire for ya FYI
Nigga didn't respect me, it's hello, goodbye
All my hoes is dykin (dykin), all yo hoes is triflin (triflin)
Yea I got a pistol but the bullets from a rifle
Yea they call me deuce, I got deuces on my coupe
Put two swishers together look like I'm blowing on a flute
Yea nigga we up, we ride up on you
Ralph Lauren teddy bear its not Winnie the Pooh
Yea nigga we winnin, and spend it on these women
And I ain't playing soccer when I'm kicking it at Lenox
Say what up to Louis, say what up to Fendi
Niggas know what we doing I make it so I spend it
