[Chorus]

I'll still be right here
Courts keep shooting me down
Judge trying to take me away
People keep shooting me down
I could care less what they say

[Verse]

Let me introduce myself
Tity Boi
2 Chainz and a double breast
Maury slippers, trap jumping like it's double-dutch
Cigarillo, newspaper and my ankles crossed
I play the boss like Ricky
LS-450, I let the whip park itself
Cause I'm a little tipsy
Codeine, cream soda and a weed odor
Yes, I'm a young nigga
Self-Esteem a little older
I'm bi-lingual
I talk shit in espa√±ola
I been selling swag
Heard it, so i'm back, order
And i'm back, relax
With the dough folder
I'm straight crack in the booth
Leave the door open
Came with the heat baby
Cause your boy scorching
Dropped the safe on my foot
Now my toe swollen
Bigfoot just like Sasquatch
Niggas didn't know the Porsche
Made a sedan car

Fuck with me
I'll make you a landmark
They say
"Make a left right there
Thats where Tit killed that damn boy"

[Chorus]
