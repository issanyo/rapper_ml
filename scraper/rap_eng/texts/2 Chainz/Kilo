[Hook]
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
Walkin' like I got a kilo
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero

[Verse 1]
I come in this bitch so fast, let me slow up on niggas
I fuckin' that bitch with the ass, and she hold up on niggas
You know that I'm drinkin', I pour up on niggas
My style, and just like I throw up on niggas
I don't fuck with niggas especially a ho nigga
VIP, I pour MoÃ«t on niggas, ayy
Triple beam to a digital scale, I got work in the mail
Clientele, I need a tractor trailer and a Ms Griselda
And I ain't into failure, and I don't even know what to tell you
I ain't got no work to sell you
I got hope to sell you, got me a boat to sail in
Ain't no joke like Rakim
Got the trap house rockin', you ain't get that shit
I got me a half, that's a split when I flip it
And whip it 'til I get me 36s
I get it, I got it, I'm slangin' narcotics
I sold dope in college, I'm semi psychotic
Might put the semi on niggas
Never keep bricks in mi casa

[Hook]
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
Walkin' like I got a kilo
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero

[Verse 2]
I do this shit for the A
Y'all get the fuck out my way
I bought a car just to race it
I pass the car just to chase it
This is a standing ovation
The trap was my standin' location
Hit the strip club in the day shift
Give a lil' bitch a donation
Fresh to my bootlaces
I just beat me a few cases
I just told myself...
"Self, I need me a new bracelet"
Who the fakest? You the fakest
Lose or take it, rule to bacon, rude awaken
You forsaken, you replacement
Got me a jacuzzi in the basement
If it was a real nigga party
You couldn't get an invitation
You niggas is basic, you bitches is basic
I'm fuckin' two hoes in two different locations
You sittin' adjacent, you need a rotation
You need a quotation
Oh my medulla is mula
That pussy so close I can taste it

[Hook]
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
Walkin' like I got a kilo
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
