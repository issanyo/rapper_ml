My slangatory self-explanatory
Have my man step your mans, man got you mandatory
Tell her lift it in her ankle for me
Real niggas in danger, need a fucking container
When I open it up, I can't fucking contain it
I've got ten toes on the pavement so why you fucking complaining?
Watch mad at my bracelet, my bracelet mad at my chain
Chain mad at my pinky so I can't wear no earrings, 2 Chainz
