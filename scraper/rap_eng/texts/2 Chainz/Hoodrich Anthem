All I rock is polo, dollar sign my logo
Then I drop the top, on my car call it porno
Yeah I'm the realest, you can ask your bm
Shawty I'm the shit, aka the BM
Whatup Dj Scream, Cory what's happenin'
Spins on the beat, Tity Boi rappin'
Its time to turn up, told em let's do it
And I'm from the A, can I hit up with that unit

I'm an astronaut, I'm a NASA, I'm a rock star, I'm a shotta
What the bumbaclot, who wanna test me
Yeah girl she wanna sex me
Carress me, for me she turn to lesbi
I'm tuned into the radio, I count up all these fetti
Ay DJ Spinz freebandz, Cory B freebandz, DJ Scream freebandz, Talk to me freebandz
Ay DJ Spinz freebandz, Cory B freebandz, DJ Scream freebandz, Talk to me freebandz

I'm so fucking turnt up with this hood bitch
Diamonds on my neck and wrist, call it hood rich
But on some hood shit, I fuck with the real niggas
In the trap with the goonies and a drug dealers
I'm so, I'm so turnt up, with this hood bitch
Diamonds on my neck and wrist, call it hood rich
But on some hood shit, I fuck with the real niggas
In the trap with the goonies and a drug dealers

I'm turnt up, hood shit, real nigga, hood rich
Bad bitches only, but she must be a hood bitch
I'm riding round in your city, strapped up and I'm gettin it
Lambo, nascar, loud pipes and I'm in it
Top down, my chain on, you a real nigga that's the same song
Glock 40 my aim on, little fuck boy, you a lame ho
I'm turnt up, can't turn me down
I'm sacked up and I'm on the town
Her head fye come, burn me down, and you know the sound

It's hood rich radio, you bet' not change the station
It's Gucci Mane La Flare they say I changed the nation
I'm a trapper slash rapper yea that's my occupation
And I don't cary chump change all I do is carry faces
I'm an ath-e-lete, I ball, I think I'm Dominique
Primetime like Dion, I make them kiss my cleats
I brought you juice, I brought you flock, Now whos the next blow?
I'm so Bouldercrest, so Texaco, so Gresham Road

I'm so fucking turnt up with this hood bitch
Diamonds on my neck and wrist, call it hood rich
But on some hood shit, I fuck with the real niggas
In the trap with the goonies and a drug dealers
I'm so, I'm so turnt up, with this hood bitch
Diamonds on my neck and wrist, call it hood rich
But on some hood shit, I fuck with the real niggas
In the trap with the goonies and a drug dealers
