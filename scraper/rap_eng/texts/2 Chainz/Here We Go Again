[Intro]
Yeah, let me catch a motherfucking wave
I got a Chanel surfboard let me catch a wave

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning
Dick look like a flag pole
Got a cashmere bathrobe
Shit, 200 on the dash board
If you feeling froggy lil nigga gonna jump he still a lil tadpole
Yeah I move a little tad slow cause I'm sipping on the castro

[Hook]
Here we go again
I drink a four again
Not going poor again
Young nigga supposed to win
I asked the Lord to forgive me
I used to jugg at Spondivits
Diamonds for wife and the children
This is my life I'ma live it

[Verse 2]
I got Jesus on my pendant
Been hustling since an appendix
When you look up I'm lieutenant
When you look up for attendance
Gucci sun all of my tennis
Make this shit look like a business
Make killers look like a witness
Make shopping look like a fitness
Ran the trap fuck the Olympics
You wasn't there you must missed it
I posted pics on my Insta
Don't you become a statistic
Don't you know I know logistics
Still got Riri on my wishlist
Your lady got me on her hit list
Don't think you gonna forget this

[Hook]
Here we go again
I drink a four again
Not going poor again
Young nigga supposed to win
I asked the Lord to forgive me
I used to jugg at Spondivits
Diamonds for wife and the children
This is my life I'ma live it

[Skit + Hook]
Yeah, I know they like whats he saying
Spondivits, that's some south side shit
Some Atlanta shit, Virginia Avenue
I used to go up in there get me a bucket of crab legs, melted butterBut at the same time I got a jug in the parking lot though, you dig
Here we go again
I drink a four again
Not going poor again
Young nigga supposed to win
I asked the Lord to forgive me
I used to jugg at Spondivits
Diamonds for wife and the children
This is my life I'ma live it
I tell em', I tell em' meet me over there by the Waffle House
I'm selling bags though no lil shit no poquito

[Outro]
Muy grande, muy muy grande, plug talk
You muy poquito, me muy grande
