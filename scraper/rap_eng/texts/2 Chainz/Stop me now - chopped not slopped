Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Ooohhh Nooothing can stop me
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Oooohh Loving yooouuu
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Nothing, Nobody
Can stop me from Loving yooouuu
Foreign exchange, I walk in the rain, still won't get wet
Nigga flick up the flame twist up the game switch up the chain
Play peek-a-boo I take ya girl and her friend and do a switch-a-roo
Started with a nick and got a 62 it was memorable my plan is worth diggable
Used to stashing work off in a inner tube in middle school
I worked the trap no interviews just told shawty that I'm in to you I'm the
Type that make a old school a Bentley coupe turn one to ten that's what I
Tend to do it's an amber alert I gotta missing roof it was black and it was
Travelling fast I love you now I don't care about your ratchet past
Designer shoes matching bags let them niggas pop shit baby we popping tags
If I ever fall off I'll be hopping back got a bad bitch with me told her
Hop in back my car speak she dark meat I be eating MC's nigga shark teeth
Velourz hoodie I ask em what's for goody if you are what you eat but I am
Not a pussy you couldn't stop me with a bunch of Uzi's and all we really do
Is shoot a bunch of movies
Started from the bottom now we at the top graduated from high school and
Bought a choppa orville red and bocker bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl cindy lauper
When they saw me they used to think of dope but now when they see me they
Just think of hope Inspiration no infiltration them niggas hatin I got they
Bitches naked hand full of ones pocket full of Hunn if I was sellin swag
Man I woulda sold it to em designer sneaks leather seats they say money
Talk that's why you never speak every I do is a rest in peace wish
This highway to heaven had an extra seat rap game extra sweet big ass charm
Conversation peice
Million off rap but the trap was sweeter when dealings on the block all
Prices cheaper I been doing this since guess and fila they say my entourage
Each car four deep eight heaters drop the middle man to cut the cost they
Say my whole click cut from a different cloth and of course we pay the cost
With each block that we off ya take off and call back it ain't our fault
That ya lost ya lil bitch ask ya boy bout them forty he lost talk slick
Glock forty ya boss now you the president fresher than peppermint whip tint
Till six bond number nine flow wall street bidness bitch
Started from the bottom now we at the top graduated from high school and
Bought a choppa orville red and bocker bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl cindy lauper
Nothing in the whole wide can stop me
Ooohhh Nooothing can stop me
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Oooohh Loving yooouuu
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Nothing, Nobody
Can stop me from Loving yooouuu
