[Hook: Tity Boi and Dolla Boy]
Here's a little story 'bout some niggers' like me, never should've been let out
The elementary Dolla boy and I'd like to say that I'm the hardest nigga
From around my way, here's a little story 'bout some niggers' like we
Never should've been let out the penitentiary, Tity Boi and I would like to say
That I'm the slickest hustler, from around my way

[Verse One: Tity Boi]
Ay, yo, since I was a youth, I pumped weed out and I been had cash money
Before we bought with expectations and Fed time facing
When I was hanging with this kid named Jason with an accent from Jamaica
My only concern was digits and consumers, cause we had this little city
Down in Alabama booming, so we just do it, get it like Nike
And even with this wife beater on, I still got something up my sleeve
It sound so odd, talking 'bout these guns cause I got a three five seven
Nine and a Mac Eleven, get drip, tip toeing 'bout a minute
Doing six with the clip showing, nigga, where your clique going
They're spreading out like buck shots and ain't nobody dying
Still alive around here but Pac, now we know this story go, so don't worry
Excuse me your honor, but could you holler at my nigga for me

[Verse Two: Dolla Boy]
Well, I'm Dolla Boy, I got game galore, you may have a lot of game
But, I've got much more, in that all blue coup√©, parked and run and shoot
Or late nights throwing rice, shooting dice with troops
And that diamond's in the back, sun roof top, I'm hanging out that bitch
'Bout to shut down the block, AK music, bomb ass track
We put the detonator to it, nigga, get wrong, put the mask on and shoot him
Street corps, nigga, tell his fam' that we sued him, used to work track
One five on the ruler but, now I'm dropping off like I'm down wit the Cubans
Straight eight grad in them hard knocks schooling, intern work, year round
Brick moving, get to this money, shit real in this music
So get it how you want it, lame nigga, don't confuse me

[Verse Three: Dolla Boy]
Nigga want to know how Dolla does it, the bag way or gram
I need all of my cousins, lame nigga flexing 'bout the work, when it wasn't
Didn't think a nigga called the cop with a oven, got enough heat
To cook the hams and the stuffing, take twenty two's
Knock the berries out your muffin, mama said a son
Was six short from a dozen, messy to my pills, man get to this money

[Verse Four: Tity Boy]
A hundred miles and running and ain't no stopping us, my community service
Is picking paper up, if the drought end, it's Glock's and mad men
TEC's are blasting, mixed with mag's and Mac Ten's, I played in play pens
And stayed in the state pens, don't think I ain't bigger
Because my weight thinner, on twenty two's is how I carry myself, I'm like
Oh, I might marry myself
