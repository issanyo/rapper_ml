[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' live
God must be really on my side
Got the baddest bitch up by my side
Cash make the pussy come alive
Everybody know I set the vibe
Bet I steal ya bitch like it's a crime
All my niggas come from doing time
Hands in the air, we just so fly

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Thank God that I'm alive! (woo)

You niggas really out of style now (style)
Bitches really need to bow down (bow down)
Migo Gang is a cash cow
Lay down the track, get the bags out (woo)
Handguns and the mags out

Smokin' cookie, 'bout to pass out (cookie)

A lot of flavor, boy, I'm all about my paper, boy (paper)
Went to L.A. and tried to smoke an acre, boy (loud)

[Bridge: Lil Jon]
I am so grateful
