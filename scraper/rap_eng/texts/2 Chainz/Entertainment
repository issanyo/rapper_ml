[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yessir!
I'ma hit the club, hit the weed
Hit the Gin then hit the track
Poppin' bottle, buy the bar
Before I came thru I had to hit the bank
Always toss a bitch or 2
You know, thats what trippy niggas do
30 girls in the V.I.P
Got you, pussy niggas spooked
Still hood, now i can buy the hood, my bitch bad, she fuck good
Walk around all through the town
I wish one of you hatin' niggas would
Life of a millionaire, on the way to be a billionaire
All I like is stripper poles and white hoes in their underwear

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin'
Here comes the bottles tell me what you’re drankin'
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
Cause tonight I need some entertainment
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
‘Cause tonight I need some entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, Entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, Entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad
From the car to the crib
‘Cause tonight I need some entertainment

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Bad man, live band, hair down my back nigga
Everything I do is dope, you would think I was a crack dealer
Big money, fast cars
Hoes all in my lap niggas
So far I done head the game
I might as well just lap niggas
Milk the game, Lactose
She could see my chain from the back row
Came in with my niggas
Left out with some bad hoes
I got a black ho, a white ho
A Spanish ho and a Chinese
Yea they call me 2 Chainz and
My first chain’s a Siamese
That’s your favorite part
Whatcha gonna do for it
Hey girl she on the Molly
Think she saw a unicorn (Damn!)
No horsin' around
Polo DRAWS
She might say yes to me and
NO to yall!

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin'
Here comes the bottles tell me what you’re drankin'
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
Cause tonight I need some entertainment
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
‘Cause tonight I need some entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, Entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, Entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad
From the car to the crib
‘Cause tonight I need some entertainment

[Verse 3: Sean Paul]
Girl roll it around and set it set
Bubble on down and pet it, pet it
Holding out the air, then get it, get it
I'ma take you home and bed it
Hopping out fast, Set it out slow
Now whine it girl, and ready set go
All of dem treads, done shed it out now
Now rum pon da time, for eat it out now
Girl you my treat girl
Come make with weed girl
Put it on repeat
And know you are my edi-tweet? girl
Put it on me please girl

Just give me that beat DJ now entertain me girl

I meh know you have a body is cravin'
Simply me not a mine for de taking
Better be ready

[Chorus: Sean Paul]
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya need a spankin'
Here comes the bottles tell me what you’re drankin'
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
Cause tonight I need some entertainment
From the table to the car, from the car to the crib
‘Cause tonight I need some entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, Entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad, Entertainment
Girl ya bad, girl ya bad, girl ya bad
From the car to the crib
‘Cause tonight I need some entertainment
