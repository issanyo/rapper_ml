[Intro sample: R. Kelly]
Together baby
Heavenly Father which art in heaven
I pray that you keep this love together

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
I prayed, about this, the days
But something told me that you ain't changing, no
And I cried from the love that we made
That's why it hurts me, cause we ain't growing
After all the things you put me through
You done apologize to me any times
It's like a broken record and I'm starting to think that I hate you
We were almost to the best part, best part

[Pre-Hook: Keyshia Cole]
You see it's niggas like you that make it hard to love
Make it hard to trust, it's so hard
And a nigga like you, you make me wanna cuss
Burn up all your stuff, and catch a charge

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
On a nigga like you
(Nigga like you, nigga like you, nigga like you)
On a nigga like you
(Nigga like you, nigge like you, nigga like you)

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
I stayed away for so many days
And something happened, and I'm so afraid
That we won't ever be [?] the same
I wonder if you felt that way
When you did the same thing to me
You done apologize to me any times
It's like a broken record and I'm starting to think that I hate you
We were almost to the best part, the best part

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Everything played out like a ringtone
Soft wet kisses on your cheekbone
I gotta lotta steak like a T-bone
Shawty why ain't you got your ring on?
I did a lot of thing know are messed up
As far as old girl I didn't eff her
[?]
I can pull a girl with no effortâ€”come here!
Look at the don of the year
That's me, come fuck with the real
I bought my girl some earrings
Chandeliers in her ears
And yeah, I'm a boss and I don't have a beard
They sayin' I'm weird
Like I'm a fierce [?]
Might have some lobster in Syria
Breakfast in bed, so wake up
Early in the morning, no make-up
It's a difference between a main and a side piece
And you ain't never met no nigga like me

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]
