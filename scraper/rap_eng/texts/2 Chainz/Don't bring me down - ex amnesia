The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

Tonight I'm twistin' 'em big, I'm poppin' pink bottles
Pull out the old school chevys and make the pipes rattle
Kev wrap the rubber bands, no credit cards
45 catch the cliques, no bodyguards
Call that my real nigga passport
Pull 'em out when them old bitches ask for it
I've been collecting paper, tryna stuff my bank account
With this pen and paper give you somethin' to think about
The diamonds shine and the wine is muscato
We ride shit from my garage, fuck a limo
My piece is 1 tenth of a dollar
She left her panties at my crib on the coffee table
I'm waitin' for the beat

The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

Tonight we're takin' the city and paintin' it all black
Drama on the soundtrack and it's all crack
Your speed exceed 100 down i20
We breathe and smoke in and out and got plenty
I'm on the passenger, tonight I'm lettin' my bitch drive
She here to buckle and the car commitin' suicide
Law enforcement on my car with cameras
Tryna connect gang members and gangsta rappers
Drug dealers, athletes and black actors
Get caught up, prostitutes and back taxes
Fuck it, tonight we're livin' like we don't exist
Time stopped like I broke the watch on my wrist
Somewhere you wanna be?

The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

What goes up must come down
And if I stay down, then I don't come up
Life a bitch, I got my hand on the but, foot on the clutch
On my new wonder, smokin' a blunt
Tired of all sililaquez, service squeeze
Still use a triple b for insominity
And please, if bein' broke is your disease
I took a test and passed and nigga I'm clean
Promethazine poured in the 2 liter
Got my gorillas with me, and I'm the zookeeper
See, you ain't seen it all until you've seen it all
If life a movie you never know when it might pause

The night is young (the night is young)
Come and go with me (come and go with me)
Up in the sky (up in the sky)
Is where you wanna be
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
