[Hook: Juicy J] (x2)
Fuckin' with my cheese, that come with beef, like Rotel
Wildin' in the club, give us room, like hotels
And I'm pimpin' hoes so you better catch this wholesale
Haters wishin' that I fall off, oh well

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I used to ride Chevy's, now it's Bentley coupes and Maybachs
From the Dirty South, fresh and clean, like some Ajax
Back when I was broke, all these hoes thought I was ugly
Now my money long and all these hoes slutty
Let's go make a movie, I do my own stunts
My money like bubbles, now watch me blow a hundred
A whole lot of drugs and some freaky snow bunnies
With "I Love Juicy J" tatted on they stomach
Let's go hit the town, smoke some Kush and get trippy
Trynna get high enough to do a song with Biggie
Straight from Hollywood to Hollywood, North Memphis
And what's the point of being rich if you can't spend it ho

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
AK-47, with the shoulder brace BRRR-RRRR-RRRAPP
First I poke your girl then hit her with that poker face
So many cars in my garage, ain't no walking space
Bitch I'm so high it feel like I can walk in space
Just ordered me a car that got a bed in it
When I get it I'mma fuck and get head in it
Ask me do I get it, you can see it can't you
When your girl leave me I bet her knees ashy
I bet her throat scratchy, I bet she call a taxi
You know I kill the pussy, toe tag it
And I'm always on time, but my roof absent
2 Chainz' charm bigger than a Volkswagen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I see why niggas out here hatin' me
Got that Stevie Wonder money, they'll never see
Whippin' 360 in that Lamborghini
With a cup of Dirty Sprite, poppin' beans mane
I don't handcuff hoes and make 'em my bride
Just take 'em to the telly put my dick inside
30 stacks for a gig
My pockets fat as a pig
30 inches on the whip, sit high like a rig
I got more bitches than a dog catcher
And that Bill Gates bread is what I'm chasing after
Breitling watch with the diamonds is a ho grabber
And I stay spaceship high, I don't need NASA
