[Intro:]
What?
It’s time for a nigga to say what’s up
Straight up

[Verse 1:]
What?
I am C.A
Diego, LA , to the bay
Yeah...it’s my shit, my nigga
L Gang got this my nigga
On lock, on wrap...whatever
Am rich come smell my leather
Rich now but am wearing whatever
Cheeseburger no beef,cow or cheddar
But I ain't trippin, take it all in
Lick that girl clit, till she take it all in
Best kush filling my joints
Say I sound to LA, that’s the point
What...Nigga what?

[Chorus:]
Nigga you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Nigga you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Got a problem?
Say that then, say that then, say that then..huh
Want a problem?
Say that then, say that then, say, say that then

[Verse 2:]
What?
Rocking Massiani in the bedroom
Trading Bentley, Lamborghini for some leg room
Put the seat back I need some head room
Got a hotel suite and a spare room
Stretch your ass out like a rubber band
Pull your ass smoke a joint with my other hand
Soul south side I spell it with a “L”
Stay down, a stripper call for help
Had a mil
Climbing up the stairs, some more on every level
You in big mess I had it immaculate
Been a hundred rights with the gully butter
But now day two, one rubber
Two chain ATL on the line
Am talking to you bitch on the line..(hello)
Hold up!
Don’t try to cover mine
I go to magic city when it’s super time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
What?
Where the bitches at?
Please keep me away from where the snitchers at
Cause I ain’t trying to hear what you gonna tell me
At least stay with one ho like I barely
Cash on the sellie
Cause a nigga getting it
Rhyme and I’m pitching it
Ain't shit different
Nigga you sweet, you gonna need some insulin
Get him coz I throw my rod deep like a fisherman
Lick her in the kitchen then
Fuck her on the floor though
Popped the nigga molly, rolling like a four door
I ain’t going down, yeah like your ho go
Getting this money, nigga ball like a cholo

[Chorus]
