[Intro]

[Hook]
I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one, ooh
Yea, I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Broken home, tell me what the fuck is wrong
Now I gotta charge a brick for a song
Trap guy, turned into a rap guy
No suit on but I still got trap ties
Argyles, pastels and some neckties
Shawty on the pill, X-file
40 hit 'em, leave 'em wet, baptised
And you know I'm a sucker for long hair and wet thighs
Mamacita baby, this is kamasutra
I got a present for you boo you looking at the future
As far as the past, nevermind that
I don't know who's finer, you or this wine glass
And you must rewind that if you don't get it
Got a taste of the good life and tracks is what I'm eatin
My chromosomes read Georgia Dome
Icy watch, I don't mind spending time alone

[Hook]
I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one, ooh
Yea, I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, get the clip out of the ashtray, put it in the air
Grab my cellphone, call my engineer
Yea, last night I was on one
Quick carwash, then I make a mall run
I'm a different brother
Louie store spending chips on some kicks I already got, different color
40 cally chrome, on deck
Gotta meet with my connect later on down in Malecone

All the Kush gone, gotta collect
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone
Weed man coming with a half a zip
30 minutes in the trap is a half a brick
Always hustle to get it
I never ask for shit
If it's family or money I might have to flip
I'mma say it if it's on my mind
I like to take it one day at a time

[Hook]
I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one, ooh
Yea, I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Never on the guest list
Always unexpected
In so many checks
I should make a checklist
Looking at these emcees' like they should make a deathwish
Got my girl in the kitchen, cooking ambidextrious
Left wrist, right wrist
Whip that, white bitch
This is a lifestyle, I didn't have to write this
Look at my Hublot, watch how the light hit
Look at my new ho, watch how the light hit
I done did it all, except die nigga
Too dehydrated to cry nigga
I was struggling, had a time limit
I wish this Aquafina bottle had wine in it
I wish that pussy had a sign in it
That said,"Warning: If you hit it then you mine nigga"
Damn, that crazy bitch on that crazy shit
If you don't make money it don't make sense

[Hook]
I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one, ooh
Yea, I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one
