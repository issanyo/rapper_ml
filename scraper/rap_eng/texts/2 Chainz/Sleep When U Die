[Intro]
It's at least 100 degrees, sweating like a fool
Aiight, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Young Juice, ayy, ayy, okay, okay
By any means I gotta get it
You can sleep when you die, point blank, period
No excuse for this, you only get one life
You only get once chance
You can get more wives
You can get more ice, you can get more cars
Nigga listen to what I'm saying, I'm a real superstar, woo

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah I got too many watches on my arm
I got too much shit goin' on
I got your favorite stripper on my phone
I got a bank account, got another bank account
Got another bank account, to be continued
Hibachi my menu, my bracelet on igloo
Every song is a single, you hear how the money talk
I may be bilingual, I pour out a liter, I light up the reefer
I'm back to charging niggas 100 a feature, yeah

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hard work beats talent
Dope boy meets Khaled
Don P and eat salad
Walking around, my feet Bally
Sisquo and St. Ives
Six guns, eight knives
Potato on the barrel of it
Make you niggas hate fries
Been poppin' wheelies since 14
Sleeping with them, in them since 14
Ready to take one for the team
Ain't no discount, if ain't the one, we got a miscount
I am the truth, lil' nigga, shooting bullets from the booth, lil' nigga
BOOM

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You too concerned with others
This for the single mothers
Might have a millionaire
Moving through Riverdale
Jacket on Rick Flair
Watch on Rick Flair
James Brown with the slick hair
Watch how she dance on it, dance on the work
If the pussy squirt, put her name in a verse
I am so high, I'm scared to jump
Keep the gas on me, I'm prepared to pump, alright

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah
