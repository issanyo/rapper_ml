[Intro: Dave East]
Money, murder, murder

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I never ran off on the plug
But I run out of court
Talking bricks like they building a fort
But Margiela they cannot afford
Loco what's whipping good?
Said it click when you hit with the fork
I'm true to Allah and I don't fuck with cops
Keep me away from that pork
I'm prolly one of the realest yet
Trust me these niggas can feel a threat
I'm not too concerned with the internet
Come pop up in spots where we really at
I think in my city I'm killing that
I'm from Harlem, how I'm not conceited?
Drop the Beamer and it's chocolate seated
Smoking sour, you still chocolate weeded
My younging hit you, he ain't got a reason
Deals is coming in, I got to read 'em
Warren Buffet shit, I gotta meet him
Hitter starving and I gotta feed him
This shit I cannot ignore
Swipe, ran out the store
I be looking like I came off a tour
You might make it rain but we make it pour
Ask them bitches bout me, they say for sure
How could I ever get bored?
Her pussy good, I could never get bored
I got a condo I'm never gon' show her
We gon' do tellies so upstairs with cheddy
No Benihana bitch go to the deli
My life in a rush, ain't no time to get ready
This shit I cannot ignore
I spend a few grand in that store
How you out holding hands with a whore?
Hand to hand with the greens, I need more

[Hook: Dave East]
This shit I cannot ignore
Tell me how can I get bored?
Coconut seats in the Porsche
This shit you cannot ignore
All of this money keep coming in
This shit I cannot ignore
Balmain from my head to the floor
This shit you cannot ignore
This shit I cannot ignore
Tell me how can I get bored?
Coconut seats in the Porsche
This shit you cannot ignore
All of this money keep coming in
This shit I cannot ignore
Balmain from my head to the floor
This shit you cannot ignore

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
This right here Christian Dior
You never seen it before
Ever since a nigga tried me in Cali
I took a chopper on tour
You can ask TMZ, MTV, BET
I got more dimes than CP3
Came from the EBT, now these foe envy me
That's off the top just like Kennedy
See this is that pay style
I turn your girl to a Paypal
I'm turning dinner to takeout
I gave her D just like 8 Mile
Whew, Skittles and M&Ms
Murder and killer the synonyms
Even massages ain't feeling them
It's more than a threat that I'm sendin' them, ooh
I never fold under pressure
I keep that thing by the dresser
I keep it right by the Bible
I hope it don't mess up my blessings, Lord
You can ask Short I'm finessing
Yeah you can ask God I was reckless
Yeah you can ask Joe bout my neckless
Yeah he put all the ice in that motherfucker
I brought all the dice in that motherfucker
Straight hole like Yanks in this motherfucker
Shit you just cannot ignore
Pinky ring bigger than yours
And my lean pinker than yours
My girl pussy pinker than hers
I bought a Porsche just to trap in
I came on that cat when I'm bored

[Hook: Dave East]
This shit I cannot ignore
Tell me how can I get bored?
Coconut seats in the Porsche
This shit you cannot ignore
All of this money keep coming in
This shit I cannot ignore
Balmain from my head to the floor
This shit you cannot ignore
This shit I cannot ignore
Tell me how can I get bored?
Coconut seats in the Porsche
This shit you cannot ignore
All of this money keep coming in
This shit I cannot ignore
Balmain from my head to the floor
This shit you cannot ignore
