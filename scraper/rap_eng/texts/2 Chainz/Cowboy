[Intro: Bon Jovi]
It's all the same, only the names will change 
Everyday it seems we're wasting away 
Another place where the faces are so cold 
I'd drive all night just to get back home 

I'm a cowboy (x 4)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
YE!

Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
I'm a cowboy, chicka pow pow boy
Shoot you from the floor to your fuckin-YE-YE!
Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
YE!
Pour a two into a one, now I'm done bitch
Niggas running they mouths, but they don't really run shit
I'm a cowboy, chicka pow pow boy
Shoot you from the floor to your fuckin eyebrow boy
2 Chainz name ringing like an Android
I think about money every time I brainstorm
And I'm in rare form if I've got Airs on
Niggas know I'm buying Guccis like they fucking Air Jordans
Outlaw lifestyle, I made a mill trapping
I'm trynna take the 'T' off and make a mill rapping
Codeine, fetti, shorty all white porcelain
Reverse cowgirl, shawty ride a nigga like a horse

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]

2 CHAINZ!
It ain't no secret, I'mma get it
I'm over niggas heads like an ATL fitted
I'm over bitches house like I'm only gonna visit
When they try to make me stay I tell them "That's some strong liquor"
You know what time it is
I'm on the strong and the sizzurp
And since a young nigga, I've been on with the wiz-ord
A nigga play me wrong I put his dome in the diz-irt
I'm going on tour, I'm going be gone till November
Ruthless, ice cubes all on my sizz-erp
Pinky ring huge, such a mofuckin insult
And if you riding dubs, then my rims are much older
Two white cups, and one cup holder
Told ya, grab me a soda
Shake it like a shake-weight
Hit you with two 4x4s, that's an 8x8
And it's not that I don't like ya, but I hate hate
I know they gonna hate on this, and I can't wait

[Outro: DJ Teknikz]
