[Intro: DJ Bigga Rankin]
Don't matter how far the road takes you
Nothing in this world can refresh your soul like being home
But a lot of niggas done sold they souls and made the wrong decision
So they can't come back home
So they try to find another source but it ain't nothing like love from the streets
I cherish these motherfuckin streets
