[Intro]
Good job, 1st

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Hundred blue faces back to back to back to back
To back to back to back, uh (uh)
How you niggas actin', actin', actin', act
Niggas sippin' Act, uh (uh)
Relax, never had to do that
Trapped before I rapped, uh (tell 'em)
Everything real (everything real)
Everything skilled (everything skilled)
Skill set a mil' (alright)
Still sellin' mil' (tru)

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Hahaha, that's how I feel
Yeah, nigga, that's how I feel (how I feel)
Yeah, that's how I feel
Nigga, yeah, that's how I feel (that's how I feel)
Um, yeah, that's how I feel
That's how I feel (ooh, yeah)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I got a handful of pills (what?)
My partner made the appeal (what?)
Look at my phone, who the bitch I'ma call? Um... *phone rings*
Walk in the mall and I buy all of y'all (woo)
Walk in the mall and I buy off the wall (uh)
Walk out that bitch and I go valet
And I get in my car and I leave it like rrr
Even my floor match the fur
I coach the shooters like Kerr
I put the rims on the curb
I got some drank in reserve
I got no reason to lie to you
I am so fresh, I could fly to you
I am so fresh, I might fly by you (uh)
I know some killers to drive-by you (uh)
I talk to my watch like it's Knight Rider
I treat my Porsche like a typewriter
Look like a bonfire
I don't like pigs, don't make me hog-tie you (uh)

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & A$AP Ferg]
Uh, yeah, that's how I feel
Nigga, yeah, that's how I feel (how I feel)
Uh, yeah, that's how I feel
That's how I feel
Uh, yeah, that's how I feel
Nigga, yeah, that's how I feel (yeah)
Uh, yeah, that's how I feel
Uh, uh, that's how I feel

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Hit a couple models when I land though (yeah)
Hop on that bitch like a camel, ayy (right)
Hit a nigga like I'm Rambo
Light his ass up like a candle, ayy
Never got no diamonds on my bangle (yeah)
My chain and my wrist do the tango, ayy
All my diamonds dancin' in the Range Rove
All of my bitches bilingual (yeehaw)
More bitches than Living Single
Khadijah and Synclaire the main hoes (alright)
Ballin' after lunch, nigga, woo
All my niggas bust, nigga (woo, whip it up)
Diamonds like a [?], nigga (woo)
Smoke 'em in a truck, nigga

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
That's how I feel
Yeah, nigga, that's how I feel
Uh, yeah, that's how I feel
Nigga, yeah, that's how I feel
Uh, yeah, that's how I feel  (that's how I feel)
That's how I feel
Uh, yeah, that's how I feel
Nigga, yeah, that's how I feel
Uh, yeah, that's how I feel (that's how I feel)
That's how I feel
Good job, 1st
