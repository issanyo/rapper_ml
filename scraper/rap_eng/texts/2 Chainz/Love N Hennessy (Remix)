[Chorus: A.CHAL]
Dame un 'e poco love with some Hennessy
You know I like it when you're mad at me
I know you're with him pero ven aquí
I know you're with him but you're callin' me

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
(Yah! 2 Chainz)
You the type of person eat your salad 'fore your soup (woah)
You the type of person, don't want no crib but want a coupe (goddamn)
Got your priorities twisted like some dreadlocks (dreadlocks)
Gucci coat deadstock
Got the Henny in a headlock (yah)
Ain't no comparin' me
The glare on me is rarity
VVS my clarity (clarity)
Ugly sweater charity (okay)
Dark liquor mafia
I see you through my ocular
I'm poppin' shit, I'm popular
My heart is on Antarctica (tell 'em)
Now hollup, let me start it up
Ain't no way you starvin' us
Money long as MARTA bus
I'm drawin' down the art of war
Hundred K, my Audemars
Fuck her 'til her body sore
Then I got her tits done
I took her to the body store (tru)
Doin' things she ain't ever tried before (tried)
Drivin' cars she'll never drive no more (drive)
And I just checked my inventory
Man, I got a lot in store
Yeah, I got a lot to pour, uh
Brought diamond rings to court, uh
Nothin' they seen before, mm
I'm on a team that score, mm

[Chorus: A.CHAL]
Dame un 'e poco love with some Hennessy
You know I like it when you're mad at me
I know you're with him pero ven aquí
I know you're with him but you're callin' me

[Verse 2: A.CHAL]
In Miami on a Monday
Fucked up, thinkin' where my life went
With her and she like Mariah
Canta when I get inside her
Mira allí I know
I don't call back, yeah it's me, I know
I've been so gone since when we last spoke
Doin' what we did since when we last spoke

[Chorus: A.CHAL & Nicky Jam]
Dame un 'e poco love with some Hennessy
You know I like it when you're mad at me
I know you're with him pero ven aquí
I know you're with him but you're callin' me

[Verse 3: Nicky Jam]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo soy tu gallo, mami, y tú eres mi polla
You like it, baby, when I give you salsa Goya
Tú no sabe' con el loco que te enrolla'
Yo te complazco pero el otro a ti te agobia
Love and some Hennessy
Yo sé como llevarte al éxtasis
I know you got a man, but I'm all you need
Before you never wanted love, now you callin' me

[Chorus: A.CHAL]
Dame un 'e poco love with some Hennessy
You know I like it when you're mad at me
I know you're with him pero ven aquí
I know you're with him but you're callin' me
Dame un poco love with some Hennessy
You know I like it when you're mad at me
I know you're with him pero ven aquí
I know you're with him but you're callin' me

[Bridge: A.CHAL]
Woah, woah, woah
Fuego, fuego
Tú lo haces, pones to', to', to'
En mí, delante, and I want it
I'm the goat, goat, goat
When it comes to me and you, me tienes loco-co
Yo te busco en la noche, baby
Woah, woah, woah
Fuego, fuego
Tú lo haces, pones to', to', to'
En mí, delante, and I want it
I'm the goat, goat, goat
When it comes to me and you, me tienes loco-co
Yo te busco en la noche, baby

[Chorus: A.CHAL & Nicky Jam]
Dame un 'e poco love with some Hennessy
You know I like it when you're mad at me
I know you're with him pero ven aquí
I know you're with him but you're callin' me

[Outro: Nicky Jam]
Así que mami pide, ah, mami pide
Dale mami, pide, ah
Me gusta cuando pides
Mami dale, pide'
Lo que quiera', pide, auh
