[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Here I go, here I go, this that C5
Bitch, I’m back, with that crack like panty lines, asinine
I get blow like dandelions, fuck more hoes than advertised
They say, "Tune, you’re dead wrong," I say wrong had to die
Pussy nigga don’t keep it real no more
Drug dealers changed, but the high stay the same
Prices go up, but the high stay the same
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain
Chillin’ in the crib with the lock on the door
Layin’ on the couch with the Glock on the floor
Within arm reach, security, alarm breach
I just cut off the lights, hope I don’t shoot my hoe
I eat so much shrimp
I smoke so much hemp
The world too small, it feel like four walls
You see, I got holes punched in
My chances are cold cut thin
But I still took ‘em, and nigga, we made it
T, roll that killer, weed up in the swisher
And make it as fat as a pig in a blanket
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin
They cry for help, we get ‘em a hankie
Ain’t nothing sweet but the shit that we drinkin’
The bitches we bangin’, the cinnamon danish
The penalty's pending, shit is restraining
It is a shame, but niggas is shameless
Niggas is assholes
Or enemas, finna get anal
Injury, time out, I just blew my mind out
But still I’m maintaining
Real gangsta shit, it get dangerous
You talking money and guns, two languages
I throw niggas from off of the plane I’m in
"Oh, my God, it’s rainin' men"
Said the weatherman to the anchorman
I send hella cash to the bank I’m with
What you do it for if it ain’t for this?
I watch my step so much, I’m starting to feel like my ankles’ wrist
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I’m in Anchorage when I think of this
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances

[Hook: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
Bitch, I smell like money, dopeman cologne (yeah)
I say, bitch, I smell like money (money), that’s that dopeman cologne (tote!)
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone (yeah)
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone
‘Cause bitch, I smell like money (yeah)
I smell like money
When you this rich, they call it wealthy
Shit, they gotta call it somethin’
Yeah, Lord, I done got too rich for stuntin’, damn
But not for thuggin’
That’s right bitch I smell like money (money), money (money)
You smell me coming

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz, uh
Totin’ double barrels in a horse and carriage
Ain’t scared of nothing except God and marriage
Through the concrete grew a rose petal
If trapping was a sport, I’d have a gold medal
I steal her, like Jerome Bettis
Call me Trill Cosby, I might spike my own beverage
Parallel park in front of Neiman Marcus
He ain’t never fly, nigga, like an ostrich
They say ain’t nothing for free, but please free my partners
Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces
Yeah, lobster rolls for an appetizer
Bad red bitch give me a lap-etizer
I’m in my Rolls Royce because it’s black and wiser
And don’t get in the way, my nig, this rapid fire
Brrr, stick ‘em, I’m a victim of being a victim
Codeines, Xanax, and liquor
Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean Molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils
Had a threesome with two sisters
I get head and you kiss her
I don’t never call and you miss her
I got every gun except a missile
I paid attention to the minister
My silhouette is sinister
Only child with trust issues
You couldn’t walk a mile in my hoop shoes
Me and Tune, two loose screws
Two parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn’t even pop up
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck
Polo T and ice watch, moccasins without socks
And I smell like money, I can count a hundred thousand with the lights off
Woo! Yeah

[Outro: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
I say, bitch, I smell like money, that’s that dopeman cologne (yeah)
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone (yeah)
I say if he ain’t getting money, leave his stank ass alone
‘Cause, bitch, I smell like money
