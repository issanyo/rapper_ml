[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
Granny came out like what the fuck going on
Everybody on the porch, everybody selling stone
Everyboy round here working, nigga Nextel chirpin'
[?] in 2004 you know back then they were serving
Back then they were working
Nigga [?]
Super charged' 442 man that motherfucker hard
T-Top foreign, buttons and all that..
You can even found where we gon' stash and work hard at

[Verse 1: Bankroll Fresh]
[?]
Serving breakdown wanna be the man who serve flakes 'round
Used to want a 87' pro ham big brain super [?]
Know I want my shit mount
Know them rubberband count it
Know your bitch on my dick
And you know I'm selling ounces
Used to ride 78, to take the shit to Stone Mountain
Now I'm a street executive with street money
Nigga and I count it
Oh you niggas looking bad
Oh you niggas looking mad
Super charge on them motherfucker
Cam, got this bitch fast
Young nigga just left the dealer
I'm talking about paper tags
I'm talking about straight cash
Where you flickas, that's your bands
Nigga try to duck the van
Keep your eye on your man
The young nigga ridin' and wildin'
Murk your ass over Xans

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Bought a Maybach out of Pro Tools
Before that it was no rules
First one with Panamera, treat that bitch like a old school
First I got them burglar bars, then I got my shit together
When we was on section 8, I feel like I'd pay rent forever
Started off with triple zeros then I got me some Ziplocs
We ain't had no peep hole, open that bitch with a 6 shot
Pull up to the dealership, left that hit a tint shop
Left that and hit the jewelry store, left there with a wrist watch
Mama still watching Matlock, got the block on padlock
Used all my Gucci boxes, as motherfucking stash spots
What more can you ask for, 200 on the dashboard
Got a trap on fire, nigga, we was down a street from the airport

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
100 grams in my nutsack, had to tuck it from 12
Grinding on my Nextel, youngins slanging them bells
My uncle Joe the dope tester he heat the dope his fishscale
Back in the day I was rapping, the dope was shippin' through mail
2004 clientele, I drank my packs on the daily
OG smelling like piss and mattress, 2 for 5 for sale
I put Fochinis on my bunion, it's the key to my step
Ferragamo 'round my waist, I put handcuffs on myself
Fuck 12 pussy nigga, they can't find out where the stash at
Hundred gas bag, in the Audi hatchback
I started grinding, ain't got no where else to hide the cash at
Granny came home like what the fuck going on!??
