[Verse 1 - Cyhi]
Boy, you just a reject
Quit crying about that bitch
And go get yourself some Kleenex
Now he wanna fight
Cause his broad all in my v-neck
I heard she a meat eater
Man, we call that bitch a T-rex
You must be on that E!
Cause you soft as Ryan Seacrest
Just for hating, I got your ho
On the phone on the coast of Key West
We're just sippin on this
VS during recess
Flew her out the country
So you can't call her on no BS
I think I'm bigger than I am, I should wear a 3x
I'm a player, I should be on ESPN in a GS
I could've hit him in his jaw
But I didn't outta respect
So I wrote this letter
And I end it in PS

You niggas so emotional
You niggas so emotional
Can't keep your feelings in control
Remind me of my ho
All you do is mug me
Everytime I hit the door

[Verse 2 - Tity Boi]
Two Chains
Me and Cyhi, it's the new Atlanta
All my dogs on that monkey shit: zoo Atlanta
I misuse a Fanta and put Codeine in it
Shake it for thirty seconds
Pour it, then I lean with it
Treat your girl like weed and let my team hit it
See through you from the bottom
Like chlorine nigga
Yeah, if I say it then I dunn did it
Have your girl trickin out for that 150
The car 150, the charm 150
Two blunts of Iran, I do a song quickly
Yeah, she texting
Two chains with a smiley face
I told her I dont get no signal
When I'm in outer space

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cyhi]
I'm on a pack of loud
Smells like I had a bowel
Movement in my jeans
Your green smells like Black & Milds
I'm married to the game, we even had a child
But I don't sweat these hoes
Thats why I pack a towel
So why you niggas tense?
Why dont you crack a smile?
I don't owe you shit, no homie thats a vowel
I'm defensive about my ends
Call me Marcus Stroud
Nigga what you mad
Cause my canoe's in her canal
My jewelry saying bling
My pistols saying "pow!"
My jesus piece is flooded
It's golden like corral
You ain't standing in the river
So I why are you in denial
That your partners love my verses
And your hoes all love my style
I do this for the lames and the haters in the crowd
So before I take a bow, I wanna say:

[Hook]
