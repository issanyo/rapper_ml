[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, big bank, a lotta gwalla (yeah)
They ain't bout a dolla? I ain't tryin' to holla
'96 Impala buckets under that
On automatic status, we ain't havin' none of that
Hey watch it partna, stay out my lane
Everybody fuckin' with my campaign
Get dough or get lost, shawty always
Like Dro say, ho fuck with me the long way
And I deliver long john son, I don't play
Poppin' out before the sun come, I don't stay
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk
That's why I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth (yeah)
I'm goin' in, finna spazz out
A nigga got a problem, we can air it out
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk
That's why I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth

[Hook x2]
Goin' in, ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth
Goin' in, ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth
Pockets on loud mouth, pockets on loud mouth
Pockets on loud mouth, pockets on loud mouth (yeah)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Woke up this morning with a bank roll
I be gettin' head like a Kangoo
Got your girl sellin' pussy to my tango
What, she so wet, think I'm gonna need a rain coat
On 285 doing 85!
Couple hoes in my stable, time to stabilize
Check the time, I better say mine bitches
Need a sign on my dick that say "Fine Bitches"
And you know I'm throwed like five pitchers
And you know I'm high like five Swishas
Jay's used to say "what up Slim?"
Cause they know I'm known to make that work cartwheel
Hot wheel, hot steel, ride around my block still
Even if it's winter time, I'm ridin' in a drop still
You don't have an idea of the life that I live
Pockets so loud, got them bitches doin' adlibs
I'm goin' in, finna spazz out
Nigga got a problem, we can air it out
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk
So I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Back on my 1-2 nigga, ace - deuce
Feds try to crucify me, call me Jesús
Get it straight dude, I ain't with that nonsense
Bank rolls like a bad bitch whippin' on mint
No joystickin' nothin' over here dog
So ain't no playin' me at all, let's be clear dog
I'm raw as ever, flawless never
Just-a flyin' big and bad, tough as leather, eatin' better
Somebody better tell 'em
'Fore that tré cinco seven hit they cerebellum
Hey they say bullshit walk and cash talk
That's why I'm ridin' I'm goin' in, finna spazz out
Nigga got a problem, we can air it out
They say bullshit walk, and cash talk
So I'm ridin' out, pockets on loud mouth

[Hook x2]
