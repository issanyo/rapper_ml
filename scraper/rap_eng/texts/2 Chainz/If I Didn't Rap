I'm the shit but know about it
Yeah, buy a pint pour a four up out it
Yeah, I could tell you hoes ain't eating
Yeah, cause you ain't got no body
Yeah
[talking]
Back on the block/ If I ain't have no shows [?]
I'll have to re-up on you niggas

[Chorus](2X)
If I didn't rap I'll have me pack, If I didn't rap I'll have me a pack
If I didn't rap I'll have me a juug, If I didn't rap, I'll show you how to do it

[Verse 1]
Swipping and swapping a pack, nigga the corner back
I got me four in the back, whip cost me four hundred flat
I'm getting thrown in that, still got my same clientele
If i didn't have me no shows, I been done bought me a bale
I been done bought me a scale, I'm getting packs in the mail
And now I got plaques on the wall, I told them like Sam I can sell
These bitches just fuck with my locks, like I was straight out of Yonkers
And I be somewhere in the trap, ​If I didn't have me a concert

[Chorus]​

[Verse 2]
If I didn't rap I'll still have me a Benz, If I didn't rap I'll still have my friends
If I didn't rap I'll go to my amigo and tell him in ten minutes meet me with ten
If I didn't rap I'll be in a trap, If I didn't rap I'll have me a sack
I got me a sack, a nigga don't know how to act
Came up with hustlers and killas
You can tell when we come in the building
You can smell when we come in the building
Give em hell when we come in the building
If I didn't rap I'll still have a bad bitch
And a side bitch don't about 'em
You the type of nigga try to take out the strip club
And try to fuck the hoe up out em

I'm the shit but know about it
Yeah, buy a pint pour a four up out it
Yeah, I could tell you hoes ain't eating
Yeah, cause you ain't got no body
Yeah, and my partner got four bodies
Yeah, and my broad got low milage
Yeah, ride around with a trunk full of raw
(raw) young nigga better know about it

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If I didn't have me a pack
[inaudioble]
You will be meet me in back
Yeah, drug, dealing, class, 101, ungh
