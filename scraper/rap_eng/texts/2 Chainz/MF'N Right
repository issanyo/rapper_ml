[Intro]
Now that’s crazy
Now that’s hard Mike WiLL, that’s hard
See I ain’t see it like that, that’s hard
You hard bruh
That’s why, that’s why we been friends for so long bruh
That’s why I used to sneak you in the club bruh
Just for that reason right there bruh
Aight bruh, let me just freestyle some more, cause this shit
I’m smoking the LSD
And god dang, I got a little drink downstairs
I don’t need it though, let’s go
Let me just fuck with this shit [?]

[Verse 1]
Mike told me this gon’ be your favorite song
Ooh, wear that red one, that my favorite thong
Put ‘em on, I said baby put ‘em on
I said what you gonna do when you go home?
Kiss your man after you sucked on my woo!
She called my phone, I told her I was at the stu
Last name Chainz, first name 2
Pull up on me, shawty you know what to do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I bought some gold chains with my drug money
Then wore it on the stage just to stunt on ‘em
That’s how we do it on the south side
Might buy an AK using all 5’s
Pittsburgh, Zone 6, Zone trey
Zone 1, do this shit like every day
Old Nat, Godby Road, Candler Road
24’s got the Wraith pigeon toed

[Verse 3]
Gas station, re-up on the petrol
Hit the trap and re-up on the petrol
Shit, by the time you get it it’s a retro
Shit, used to have a job outside of Citgo
Shit, by the time you get it I’ll be peww nigga
Yeah I been a player since the womb nigga
OG Kush is my perfume nigga
Ice on my wrist, I got my mind right
Riding down the street with the Klondikes
Two black hoes, white one in the middle
I’m getting to the S with two lines in the middle
Got a bankroll that’ll make it whip

[Hook]
Told a bitch you motherfucking right
Told a bitch you motherfucking right
Told a bitch you motherfucking right
Told a bitch you motherfucking right
