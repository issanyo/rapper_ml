[Hook: King Louie]
Every day I MUBU, God mighty to Bruce
Hard body Shotta, you can call me Zoo Lou

[Verse 1: King Louie]
Drilling on that G shit, roast em' with the forty
Signify I mean it money G-E-T it
If you ain’t bout that beat it
What I smoke be seedless
Mooley over bitches, bullets for the snitches
Faster attitude, who care about a witness?
Banding up for fitness stupid cake no wishes
Every day is Christmas, my niggas is hitters
You can make the hit list
T-shirt with pictures, your bitch is my mistress
She give my dick kisses, syd with the head I nick named her vicious
D-O-P-E in swishers
Got bitches by the sisters
I love all my brothers we fuck baby mothers
But due to the fact that they don’t trust us, it's fuck our baby mothers
Double fuck the busters, amen to the hustlers
Fly E-N-T M-A-D-E nobody can touch us
Stacking while I spend it, balling, no ruckus!

Money over bitches, yesterday, tomorrow, right now
