Breakfast

[Verse 1: Kreayshawn]
Oh its Kreay baby
Oh hey, baby
I get to work you just lazy baby
I need my break now, when where and how?
This second, right here, with a couple pounds
I be town down dropping in the scraper
I’ve been around the world, doing shows and getting paper
Need my medicine, again, again
I’m with 2 Chainz with two bricks in two hands

[Hook]:
I-I-I-I’m hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay Hefner, Playboy bunny
Bout that juice, cheese, bread. Breakfast
Stackin’ dough, for breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread. Breakfast
Stackin’ dough

[Verse 2: Kreayshawn]
Eight in the morning and I'm up yawning
My phone's almost dead cause everyone is calling
It's breakfast time and I need my apple jacks
And I need my fresh grape syrup and a money stack
We’re just popping off just to kill shit
And we drink a lot so we don’t feel shit
She's in her birthday suit and shes cooking too
Yeah it's breakfast time but it's only two

[Hook]
I-I-I-I’m hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay Hefner, Playboy bunny
Bout that juice, cheese, bread. Breakfast
Stackin’ dough, for breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread. Breakfast
Stackin’ dough

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 CHAINZ!..Ugh..I’m up now
Smoking on that loud until the sun down
Beating on that pussy 'til the sun up
You don’t like what we doing shut the fuck up
Me and Kreay that’s all I gotta say
I don't see a lil' nigga cause the money in the way
Lil' Wayne unquote Titty from the A
When I’m in California, bitch I’m trynna fornicate
If you ain’t talking money ain’t no need to conversate

[Hook]
I-I-I-I’m hungry, hungry for this money
Call me Kreay Hefner, Playboy bunny
Bout that juice, cheese, bread. Breakfast
Stackin’ dough, for breakfast
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
I got all the syrup, I got, I got all the syrup
'Bout that juice, cheese, bread. Breakfast
Stackin’ dough
