[Intro]
Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you
Who else gon' believe in you? Who else gon' believe in you?
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?
Who else gon' believe in you, who else gon' believe in you?

[Verse 1]
Believe in yourself, health is wealth
Gotta get mine, faster than a step
I can make a hundred thousand just sitting by the steps
I can count a hundred thousand with my feet in the chair
I can pull the baddest broad in here
With my hand pulled behind my back
One hand on the steering wheel
2 Chainz with the ponytail, got the bodyguard concealed
Ill meaning of sickness, I use the pharmacy as a witness
I mean anything around me that's against us, they can't be
I got God on my side, that's all I need to ride
See that's all I need to vibe, asking what I do tonight
That's really none of your business, unless you wanna get in this

[Chorus]
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors go dat way, doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors, Wraith, my doors, uh

[Verse 2]
I'm good, I'm good like Ye
I'm good like Sean and Push
I'm good, I'm good, okay
Good, sold yay, good 4 way
Oh man, look at me now
Used to have a killer crossover
Now I think I done crossed over
White fans at my rap shows
So many chains on I give you the cold shoulder
So many chains on, I tell 'em move over
Big shit over here, boy
100 acres on my property, man I might hit a deer, boy
I got felonies that's older than y'all niggas
Family time at the mall, nigga
6'5", I never been small, nigga
Your swag like RuPaul, I'm appalled, nigga
Yeah, three calls to call food
I want some Nobu, met her at Whole Foods
I just ate Pro Tools, I am the go-to

[Chorus]
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah the doors go dat way
The doors go dat way, the doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors go dat way, doors go dat way
Rolls Royce, bitch, yeah my doors go dat way
My doors, Wraith, my doors, uh

[Outro]
Felonies that's older than y'all niggas
Family time at the mall, nigga
6'5", I never been small, nigga
Your swag like RuPaul, I'm appalled, nigga
Yeah, three calls to call food
I want some Nobu, met her at Whole Foods
I just ate Pro Tools, I am the go-to
I am the go-to, I am the go-to
Trap shit, I'm the go to
Trap nigga with a gold tooth
Believe in yourself, who else gon' believe in you?
Who else gon' believe in you?
Believe in yourself
Who else gon' believe in you?
