They out some big boys out there rounding up the crew
Everybody running around scared and confused

Ima make it work, make it work, make it work yeah
Ima make it work, make it work, make it work yeah
Ima make it work, make it work, make it work yeah

Young Fame:
I’ma make it work triple O.T
Been had the streets triple O.G
Ask about me and they’ll say that I’m a grinder
Young flashy rich n—a with me you’ll find a – team full of hitters. ball heavy weights

Yous a baby baller. I’m ’bout seven figures

2 Chainz:
Yeaahh 2 chaiiiinzz
The feds tapping phones so I talk in codes
This s–t jumping out the gym and I ain’t talking pros
Polo on my drawers. Bentley in my driveway
I was in the trap. When you was on MySpace
Money on my mind state. Increase the crime rate
Pinky ring so big you could see it on a blind date
Car game – irrate. Wheel parked outside
S S on it and that stands for South Side
Outside cooling. Deuce in the juices
Two cups on me. Shout out to Houston
We got a problem Houston. They taking my style they boosting
They lame and they ho know it
Ask your girl what she want for it!

Chorus:
I just got off the phone
Yeah I heard the bad news
They out some big boys out there rounding up the crew
Everybody running around scared and confused
I got a little work left, guess what Ima do?
Ima make it work, make it work, make it work yeah
Ima make it work, make it work, make it work yeah
Ima make it work, make it work, make it work yeah
Ima make it work, make it work, make it work yeah
