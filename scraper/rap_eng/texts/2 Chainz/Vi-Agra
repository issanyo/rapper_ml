[Intro]
Yeah
Viagra? 2 Chainz!
Pull up in your city askin' bout my back-then
I pull it out your girl tell me put it back in
Hair weave killer have me puttin' tracks in
Then I black out black coupe with some black rims

[Chorus]
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
Car so damn big it look like I'm hidin'
I am so damn fly look like I'm flyin'
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard

[Verse 1]
Yeah okay I pull up at the light
They already choosin'
Ralph Lauren boat shoes I'm already cruisin'
Audemar P, tell 'em order more drinks
It be me, her and her tell 'em all the more freaks
I'm gettin' to the Benjis I be puttin' it in her kidney
Addicted to the money smokin' loud from my prescription
Look at my position man I started off local
Now I got my own shows and I don't need a fuckin' co-host
I'm a logo ho I got logos all over me
Photos of me posin' like Jodeci, poetry
Me and two girls man you know it's like floetry
I tell 'em hoes goodnight go to sleep
Forty deep forty day forty nights
Sippin' dirty sprite
Married to the game that's my prototype
My polo white my four door white white rims
Lookin' like Casper
I'm the man bitch you can be the man after
I provide jobs like a contractor
One button make the car back up
See I'm a syrup sippin' animal, emcee cannibal
All I spit is gasoline, all my verses flammable (ugh!)

[Chorus]
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
Car so damn big it look like I'm hidin'
I am so damn fly look like I'm flyin'
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard

[Verse 2]
I be going -- I be going hard
I'm from GA just to state the odds
PSA -- public service announcement
If you ain't gettin' no money get the hell from 'round me
You don't grind you don't eat check the logo
Duffel bag full of cash I'm hard like a porno
My sweater come from Polo
Sweat her that's a no-no
And no I'm not from D.C. but bitch you gotta go-go
I'm hard on 'em no homo
Pause -- smoke fo', pause -- smoke mo' I need to take a photo
Cam-er-a ready when I walk out the front do'
Last name respect first name utmost

[Chorus]
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
I'm ridin'
Car so damn big it look like I'm hidin'
I am so damn fly look like I'm flyin'
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
I be goin' hard -- Vi-Agra
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
Go, Go, Hard, Hard
