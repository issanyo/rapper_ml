[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block-ow, dope enough to go in yo nostrils
I take ya girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead ass rappers
It's probably one these pussy ass niggas, don’t try me I’ll pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my cup, and your rent in my swisha
That pussy so good I miss you, head game’s so vicious
And all I get is cheese like I’m taking pictures

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, less I’m with you
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss you
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million fore they die
Wattup

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true, that’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out
And I say damn that makes two of us
Aww that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s whats her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talking they'll confirm
Go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keeping my cup full
So I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back
We don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some
I’ll out rap his ass, out trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass
Take him out, bring em in, them whole things
2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t
Went where they say I couldn’t (tru)
YSL belt buckle, ya’ll niggas sure is looking
Ya’ll niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy!

[Hook]
