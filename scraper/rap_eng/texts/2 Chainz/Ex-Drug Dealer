[Verse]
Make danish street I had a bag full of buns
Southside nigga you just serve a lil jawn
Own got me wrote, I shot dice with the truth
Hit D-mode and then I served big arm
Anytime 50 came to town I serve buck
Anytime the Sixers play the Hawks, I seen truck
Had a half a ticket 'fore I met with Def Jam
Ask Chris every 20 who with the X-Men
No Wolverine here
Collect a 100 hundred dollar bills like a souvenir
Carbon 15 hit me Jeezy want a zip
And Weezy gon' buy everything except for brick

[Hook]
See I could run the checkup and you just run your lips
I could run the checkup and you just run your lips
I could run the checkup and you just run your lips
I could run the checkup and you just run your lips
You ain't running
