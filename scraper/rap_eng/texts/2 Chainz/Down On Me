My bitch got ass and titties
From the hood but she act sadity
In the club, took a shot to the kidney
Probably won't make it to 50

Put it all in and I got her running

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I wanna see you butt naked in a fur coat
Fuck her in the shower when she drop soap
Only live once is my motto
After we have sex I pay your car note
Wearing Ferragamos and Benihanos
I'm pulling up the way I turtleneck in the summer
With a girl named Summer put her leg to the ceiling fan
So wet I might dive off the diving-board
I watch you pop it like a rubberband
New Rollie, I don't mind spending time alone
I want you so bad that I pray for it
Might stay till the club close cause I wait for it
