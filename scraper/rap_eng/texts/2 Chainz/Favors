[Verse 1: Travis Garland]
She said, "ain't no other girl gonna love you like me"
"Ain't no other girl gonna fuck you like me"
She ain't lying, wa-wasn't lying
In the bed, in the kitchen, hanging off the balcony
Take your clothes all off
I'll fuck you right here int he car
Don't care who sees

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Garland]
Cause I'mma do you a favor
Then you do one for me
I know, oh, I know
Want you to take it slow
Cause I'mma do you a favor
Then you do one for me

[Chorus: Travis Garland]
(Do you a favor girl)
You do one for me
(I'mma do you a favor girl)
You do one for me
(You do, I'mma do you a favor girl)
You do one for me
Cause I'mma do you a favor
Then you do one for me

[Verse 2: Travis Garland]
Swear ain't no other man gonna love you like this
Ain't no other man gonna fuck you like this
I ain't lying, I, I ain't lying, no
Baby, I can stretch you out, gymnastics
Have you twerking all in a split
I'll be good, I swear
Put both your legs up in the air
I'll, I'll make you scream

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Garland]
Cause I'mma do you a favor
Then you do one for me
I know, oh, I know
Want you to take it slow
Cause I'mma do you a favor
Then you do one for me

[Chorus: Travis Garland]
(Do you a favor girl)
You do one for me
(I'mma do you a favor girl)
You do one for me
(You do, I'mma do you a favor girl)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Shawty wanna be famous, ass so big put her on my a list
And I land her, like acres, she next to me like a neighbor
I started down with her ankles, I moved up to her naval
My next move is fatal, one leg on the bed, other on the table
It's going down I'm like escalators, Ben Franklin and the twenties separate
Trying to get her body naked, fuck y'll no contraceptive
I'm raw like that,  showing y'all something you ain't never really even saw like that, ball like that
Fuck the girl, if the pussy good, we at the mall like that

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Garland]
Cause I'mma do you a favor
Then you do one for me
I know, oh, I know
Want you to take it slow
Cause I'mma do you a favor
Then you do one for me

[Chorus: Travis Garland]
(Do you a favor girl)
You do one for me
(I'mma do you a favor girl)
You do one for me
(You do, I'mma do you a favor girl)
You do one for me
Cause I'mma do you a favor
Then you do one for me
