[Verse 1: Jordin Sparks]
Hair done, fitted and I'm on one
Bet I look better than your last one
Babe, I know we don't care
Instafamous ova night, yeah
Don't be scared to admit it
Seen you look from the start, oh
On my Instagram, you be lookin'
Secret looks on your phone, I know

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
Baby, on the low
You stay on my page 'cause I guess I'm your favorite
But you won't let it show, no way
If you like what you see then you gotta let me know
That you won't double tap that ho
That you won't double tap that ho

[Verse 2: Jordin Sparks]
Go and lemme know about ya
Hashtag, somethin', show you're gangsta
Oh no, don't be no square
Just say it, just say it if ya want me

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
Baby, on the low
You stay on my page 'cause I guess I'm your favorite
But you won't let it show, no way
If you like what you see then you gotta let me know
That you won't double tap that ho (hey)
That you won't double tap that ho

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, yeah
You must be a psychic 'cause I've been lookin'
Ya ass gettin' fine, what ya been cookin'?
Niggas know I woulda been took it
School of hard knocks, they were playin' hooky
I really did it 'cause I say I did it
It's a turn on if a girl say she independent
It's a turn on if a girl say she ain't offended
If I ask her, can a homegirl come to dinner?
Keepin' a picture, is you a singer or a stripper?
Tryna get with you, your other nigga unofficial
Now is it an issue? Well, I ain't think it was an issue
'Cause when I get with you, I double tap more than a picture

[Chorus: Jordin Sparks]
Baby, on the low
You stay on my page 'cause I guess I'm your favorite
But you won't let it show, no way
If you like what you see then you gotta let me know
That you won't double tap that ho
That you won't double tap that ho
That you won't double tap that ho
Hey, hey, hey, hey
That you won't double tap that ho
Double tap, double tap
Double tap that, watch me double tap
