[Intro]
Yo, okay
All my niggas with me
All my niggas with it
All my niggas ballin'
All my niggas athletic
All my niggas A1
All got street cred
All my niggas ballin'
All my niggas athletic

[Verse 1]
Pulled up in a Phantom
Pulled off with a dancer
Got a pocket full of money
Kinda hard to keep my pants up
Nigga tryna run them bands up
Fuck a bitch with my hands up
Lil Quay fuck the Xans up
Kinda hard to understand her
Duffle bags in the Escalade
Call the bitch, there a bread truck
Got the bitch going retarded
Call Uber for a spare truck
All these niggas never scared us
All these niggas never ran up
Bitch tryna put the head on me
Niggas tryna put the feds on me!
Niggas tryna take meds on me
Everything for the players only
Niggas sunny like Arizona
Gunshots just for sayin' something
Spraying shit like aerosol
You a foul and that's a fair ball
Nigga can't reach the goals
Keep shootin' a damn air ball

[Hook]
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
Uh, watch out, lil bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich!
You getting mad
And I'm getting rich!
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch (stiff arm!)
Hey, watch out, lil bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich
You getting mad
Bitch, I'm getting rich

[Verse 2]
Watch out, lil hoe
My partners still smoke on parole
They say that I'm crazy
I used to talk to a stove
I tell it to lock, shit, I tell it a lot
Go to the dealership, fishtail off the lot
You know I'm comin' straight out the block
You know I'm comin' straight out the top
Shawty said she want 5 million
'Cause I told her to leave and called her a thot
Shit, you can like it or not, damn
I'm comin' straight out the pot
Still got some ACT in my stock
Nigga I ain't gotta lie
Nigga I ain't gotta try
You wavin' that thing in the sky?
We wavin' that thing at your body
We wavin' that thing at your eye!
Look at the watch on my wrist
Got 'em all watchin' my wrist
Told that lil bitch I'll pass
Nigga watch the assist
I run the trap like the marathon
You niggas softer than silicone
You know what it's like when the feelin' gone
I know what it's like when the ceilin' gone
I had a sit down with Farrakhan
Turn the White House to the Terror Dome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch!

[Hook]
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
Uh, watch out, lil bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich
You getting mad
And I'm getting rich
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
(Stiff arm)
Hey, watch out, lil bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich
You getting mad
Bitch, I'm getting rich
