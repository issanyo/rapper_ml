[Intro: Travis Scott]
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
(Major Lazer)
Word
Straight up

[Verse 1: Pusha T & Travis Scott]
Outlaw, outlaw, like I hit the PowerBall
Once all eyes is on me, floatin' off like Southpaw
Niggas love to count yours, hoping that your paper fall
Wishing death upon me, but I'm here forevermore (Straight up!)
I just get debated on, I just get my greatest on
Saint Laurent on speed dial, I just put the latest on
Bring it on, bring it on, you want war, then bring it on
Set this bitch on fire, nigga, we can have a sing-along

[Chorus: Travis Scott & 2 Chainz]
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is the gas and the lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire (La Flame!)
All I need is the gas and the lighter
(2 Chainz)
And we'll have one hell of a time
(Straight up!)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I got a California king in my condo
Got a mothafuckin' big screen by the front door
Got a guest bedroom filled up with fur coats
Nigga, ain't no room in this bitch to even jump rope, yeah
The fire and desire and I'm higher than my prior
My attire I acquire might require a Maliah
Woah, might accept ya and deny ya, no denial
I'll be in the courtroom on the table screaming, "Rider"

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is the gas and the lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire (La Flame!)
All I need is the gas and the lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
(Straight up!)

[Verse 3: Mad Cobra]
Tell them likkle pussy deh nuh violate, violate
21 outta di clip me fire straight
White line, yellow tape, book your flight, look a date
Send di pussy back to di maker, whether hell or higher gate, yeah
Clip big, diss badman, you get a split wig, split wig
Undertaker look see what a sick did
West Coast, East Coast, we love weapons
Bullet through your fuckin' vest, left your chest exposed

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is the gas and the lighter
And we'll have one hell of a time
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire (La Flame!)
All I need is the gas and the lighter (La Flame!)
And we'll have one hell of a time
(Straight up!)

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
All we do is relax, sit back and smoke
We ain't got no job, we goin' from broke
That ain't stoppin' from gettin', gettin' inside of here
Taking off in our cars, feel like we in the air stream
(Straight meta, straight meta)
You need to know that I'm a rider

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
You need to know that I'm a rider
Tonight we gonna set the streets on fire
All I need is the gas and the lighter (La Flame)
And we'll have one hell of a time
(Straight up!)

[Outro: Travis Scott]
(Major Lazer)
Straight up!
