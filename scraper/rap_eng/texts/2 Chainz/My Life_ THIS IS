[Hook: Kulprit D]
I am so blunt you could get high off me
If it's bout church or money, I am all on it
Yeah. I do this day and night
You may think it's crazy but to me it's just my life

[Verse One: 2 Chainz]
Uh, pull up in the rari, my h* beside me
It's a two seater, your b***h can't ride, h* I'm sorry
Let's get it jumpin', call it center court
On the loud, you can smell that scent on me in court
Just beat the case, call it Larry Holmes
On the plane with your b***h and a carry on
I do it for my city, then I fly away
I can see tomorrow, I'm so high today
I told 'em let's pray, I keep killin' verses
Yo b***h with me, she wearin' killer purses
Pull out that 7, Mac-11
Pastor, reverend, Versace heaven

[Verse Two: Kulprit D]
Bought my side chick Prada just for the hell of it
Money-scented candle cause I love the smell of it
See me downtown flexing every day
See me out here snatching every babe
See me at church, dough on every plate
Ahead of my time. I am never late
Jesus piece in the rear view mirror
Darkest hour, but I see clear
Well, well. What do we have here?
Out of hiatus so beware
Young Matthew Perry. Young Matthew Perry
In this busy world. Where's Richard Scary?
Still be the one with the mic in my hand
Still be the one that make people say, "damn."
They still be the ones wanna hear it
They spazzing like they caught the spirit
Boy, I told ya, sick as Ebola, fly as a kite
I'm just KD. And this just my life

[Hook]
