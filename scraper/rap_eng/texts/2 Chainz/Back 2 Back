Girl, you do it so good

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Show time, 5 minutes, 2 Chainz your on

She on me like cologne, I'm on her like perfume
Get her in my bedroom
Then it's boom then it's pew
Hey baby, what you want me to do?
I’m prayin’ you, say you
T.R.U. out, let’s screw
Monkey sea, monkey do, no zoo
You kiss me, I kiss you
Sex is a weapon, my pistol
Go boom-boom, chitty bang-bang
You can watch me, really ain’t no thang
Damn!
