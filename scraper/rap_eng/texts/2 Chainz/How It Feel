[Verse 1 - Bankroll Fresh]
Do you know how it feel to ball like this ?
I'm with a bad Malibu white bitch
Shining hard my earring blinging right wrist
It's on flame, LeBron James, yeah I iced it
I'm a real street nigga I know prices
Hit the door one time and get Hyphy
Real trap nigga, 95 Nikes
Racks in my pocket, who don't like it ?
Blue P behind the gates, yeah she feisty
Georgia Power cut us off, my junkies got us on
And I'm in this motherfucker, I ain't going home
Do this shit for all my niggas trapping out the phone

[Hook: Bankroll Fresh]
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this
How it feel, how it feel to ball like this

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz]
10 band, take a zan, then you like me
Got the girl in my room on my right knee
My white T filled with Cuban links on it
And my bitch so cold, she need a mink on her
How you feel, how you feel in that G shit ?
Got my first foreign whip off a remix
See I do my own thang I don't need y'all
I got every rights, 6 flags, got the [?] to free fall
Bitch no, get out off my business, operation big dogs
6 cars, tell them fucking flees they'll get picked off
Sick bars, I'm a fuck menace in some Gucci tennis
She might get the pussy raining, I might do a show in [X]
