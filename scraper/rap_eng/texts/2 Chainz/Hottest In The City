We the hottest niggas in the city
Where them bitches (Where they at?)
Hottest nigga in the city, where them bitches at
We the hottest niggas in the city
Where them bitches (Where they at?)
Hottest nigga in the city, where them bitches at
Where them bitches at [x3]
We ain’t even seen em
Where them bitches at [x3]
We ain’t even seen em

[Verse 1]
All I All I know
Girls start choosing I’m like alright alright ho
Do it all night long, and we ended on the couch but we started on the phone
Now we stay together, what we started at our home and
When I say it’s on then it’s on like a bitch
And I put it on her ass and it’s been on ever since
And I own own rent, and I own my own shit
I got a bottle of cologne that costs more than your rent
And I came from cement, we the hardest of the hardest
And by now you noticed we the hottest of the hottest
And I’m probably in my Pradas, or flexing in my Fendis
When we shoot it, we shoot it till it’s empty

[Bridge][x2]
Where them bitches at? (where they at?)
There them bitches go (there they go)
Tell them bitches no (no)
Why? cause they move too slow (slow)

[Verse 2]
I’m looking, I seen em
I like em, I eat em
I’m swerving in my BM, shoutsout to my BM
Gucci on my denim, Gucci on my womens
She fit that so splendid, articulate she winning
I take her out to Lenny’s then I take her down to [?]
And we go out to eat then I take her to the [?]
Yeah my trap going ham and my money expanding
We were dope boys and now we dope man
