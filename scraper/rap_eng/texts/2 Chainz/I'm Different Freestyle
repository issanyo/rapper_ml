Time to get it like on another minute
Pass the Molly Ill be sweatin
Then she gonna be fuckin with it
Call me if you tryna get it
Baby we can get it get it
Have moanin moanin
Till the early mornin
Pussy swollen ahh

[Hook]
I got dreams that my name will be up in lights
Shining bright as I'm Rollin one feelin right
It feel good to sit back and say you made it
No achievements yet but highly anticipated
Never selling out maybe for the right amount
7 years of fame is what I'm talking bout
Never speaking out of mind only speaking what I say
We here lord made it to the better days, gone

[Verse 1]
When I pull up to the club know the windows missing
And When I pull up to the scene know the bitches trippin
Cuz it's S.O.S.A no one listened when I said that one day is be the one missing
From the streets, yeah I made it to the beach where the girls stay tanned and the money stay impeached
Stay high like I'm running from my feet
Look on the bright side I might die next week
Never said this
But I don't need her
I'm tryna bust a nut the ima try to leave her
Don't mind me I do my own shit
No bitches no snitches like I own shit
Pop a Molly I'm sweatin bitches
If you ain't fuckin Then I move on to the next .., bitches be .. acting like I got an S on my chest i ain't tryna save u I'm tryna fuck then step oooff
See I made me now I made you fall in love straight dissin off the old dudes you ain't true too well let's get it boo
Fuckin all night no curfew
See I meant it before when I said it'll be a one night galore titties galore asses galore bitch drop to the floor make that pussy scream roar
