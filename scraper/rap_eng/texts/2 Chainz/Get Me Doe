[Hook: Wale]
Get me doe, get me doe
Where your hood at nigga, get me doe
Get me doe, get me doe
My nigga let 'em know where y'all from
And tell me where y'all from
Hol' up tell me where y'all from in here
Tell me where y'all from in here

[Verse 1: Young B]
Oh you know im in this hoe
Flow so crazy yeah I know
Never heard nobody like this before
Im out here tryna get that dough
Up in the club I be gettin throwed
Up in the club with a centerfold
All these new rappers they gettin old
Sorry to hear that yo business closed
Lock & load, cock & squeeze
All these rappers on their knees
Homicidal mothafucka
Got em screaming young b please
Flow so cold I make em freeze
Murder beats, first degree
Im a dog and these rappers pedigree
Thats what you get when you fuck with me
This ain't only rappin
We really bout that action
Team full of goons Im the captain
When I let em out they be clappin' aaah
Bitch betta have my paper
This ain't no game homie Im no lakers
What that shit mean, I play no games
But I send playaz to mess up yo frame.. 2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Long hair, I don't give a fuck
Last night I prayed that God would make a Bentley truck
Get the bucks quick as fuck and I got my semi tucked
But if I pull my semi out, Aflac, you better duck
Ask me where I'm from I should tell you no lies
So many niggas with me you would think I work for Verizon
Ok enough with the lyin', you know I'm tougher than iron
And everything I do it big I'm talkin' Christopher Wallace
So much money on me that it won't fit in my wallets
And these are Rock & Republics so it won't fit in my pockets
Swagger on a trillion so you divide it by five
That mean it still on a billion, survive like Destiny's Child
Turnt up, word up, chains hang to my sternum
Favorite room is my kitchen, I came up with the yola
You know I live for today, and I'mma do it to death
I'm so fresh I spell South with a F
