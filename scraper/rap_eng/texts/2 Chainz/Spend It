[Hook]
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it’s mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it

[Interlude]
I am smoking on exotic, my girl ain’t got no stomach
Every time we have sex she always ask me for a hundred
I asked her if she worth it, she asked me do I want it
I say when I went to school bitch money was the subject!

[Hook]
I'm ridin round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it’s mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it


[Verse 1]
I'm ridin' round my side of town, boxing gloves, I beat the trial
I had the coke, I had a smile, I had a coat for every style
Crocodile the gator type, I'm allergic to the hater type
I'll take ya wife, give her back, 9 months after that SIMILAC!
Similar to saying mama's babydaddy maybe uhh
When we had sex I was in the Mercedes
And I ain't crazy but if that’s my baby
Then we gonna have to name that lil baby Mercedes
The money that I makin' I don’t see ya like I'm blind
I rather spend money baby I don’t spend time
My pocket’s on full and so is my gas tank
And all my cars got gas in the ashtray

[Hook]
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it’s mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it

[Verse 2]
Pho-to ready my polo out the cleaners
I'm the the perfect definition of something you’ve never seen of
Maserati, Kawasaki, bought my girl a beamer
The jewelry I got on is matchin' with the tequila
Patron, margaritas, double for my divas
I bring all my guns to work, Gilbert Arenas
Plus I'm killin' features and I'm killin' shows
I should have sex in the coffin’ cause I’m killin' these hoes
Fulfilling these goals, climbin' up the ladder
Shoot your ass down you know I rep Atlanta (Southside!)
I'm ridin' around stuntin', smokin' loud in public
Talkin loud in public, yeah my entourage is bucking

[Hook]
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it's mine I spend it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it, it’s mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
It's mine I spend it, it's mine I spend it
It's mine I spend it, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
