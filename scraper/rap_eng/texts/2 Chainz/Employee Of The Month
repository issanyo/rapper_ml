[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, yeah, 2 Chainz
If I ain't at the party then it ain't started
This is trendsetting, you niggas is trend following
I don't care if she's modeling as long as she's swallowing
Bitches all around my crib, I got hoes all on my ottoman

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Yea I love these girls, bitches on my dick
Been around the world, ain't seen shit like this
Ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit like this
Ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit like this
From the back, to the front, she the employee of the month
She shook her back then front, she the employee of the month
Back, front, I'm back, to frontin'

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
I did what I said I would anyway, I do this shit, like anyday
Nigga want to play around like a playground
Nigga laydown, look at that trigger plate
Southside, lean with the my MI-WI
Started from the inside, drag his ass outside
Chain so big you can see that shit from the blind side
At their neck like a bow tie, I'mma be a multi
Opposite of broke, you can't go where I go
Mop their ass, they got a motherfucking dry floor
And I walk on a tight rope
I got balance and them Balenciagas
And I woke up, whole enchilada
I got a bitch beside, I got a bitch beside

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Yea I love these girls, bitches on my dick
Been around the world, ain't seen shit like this
Ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit like this
Ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit like this
From the back, to the front, she the employee of the month
She shook her back then front, she the employee of the month
Back, front, I'm back, to frontin'

[Bridge: LIZ]
Cause everybody needs love
We never seem to get enough
I'll show you what it's made of
Just need you to lift me up
(Lift me up, lift me up)

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Yea I love these girls, bitches on my dick
Been around the world, ain't seen shit like this
Ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit like this
Ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit, ain't seen shit like this
From the back, to the front, she the employee of the month
She shook her back then front, she the employee of the month
Back, front, I'm back, to frontin'
