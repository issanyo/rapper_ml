[2 Chainz]

My rhyme style real nonchalant
Trust me rude boy ain't what you want
Hit your ass up have you doing somersaults
Then I drop your trashy ass off in the garbage
Every week I get my car washed
This is the life of a hustler this is not facade
And what you looking at is not a mirage
You probably see me at the W having a Menage
Performing
Slap a little ass recording
Im doing 160 for my niggas in Porsches
They say I'm speeding cause im on that far left side
I'm from the south but im smoking on that west side
Im in my best ride
I let my girl wash clothes on the G4 so I can let the jet dry
I'm the best I know this
And you ain't even notice
Until I rode up on you in a Lotus
Brushing dust off my shoulders
Like fuck it im focused
Im fucking with bitches thats only fucking with soldiers
Now listen
I got a old school the color of Okra
The tires as wide as Oprah
Watching it when its approaching
Now listen
Peace up
A-Town down
You know I got that piece up so I won't play around
Got a extra round
Plus I got a clip on it
Pollute your block
I put all that shit on it
2chain!
