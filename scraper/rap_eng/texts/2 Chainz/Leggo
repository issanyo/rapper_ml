But I don't really see nobody else but you, but you girl!
From the second I stepped, you caught my eye
From the minute I saw you, you've been on my mind
Looking at my wrist, it's about that time, what you wanna do, girl'

We know, everywhere we go
Like the white things with me, tuxedo

Slow it down, full speed ahead
Your bottom of your shoes are even red
Got numerous position in the bed

And if your friend ain't picture it
Then we gonna need another friend
Get your love on' say ain't turning down
That's my prerogative like'
What goes around comes back around
And back in town!
