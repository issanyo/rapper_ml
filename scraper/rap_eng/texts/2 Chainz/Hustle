[Hook:Ca$hBoii]
I got 2 straps like a backpack
I got the ball like a running back
Money, and Hoes, and the Cars
Nigga I’m fallin’ in love with that
I might pull up and then hit the Dabb
I might pull up and then pop ya man
I might pull up and then blow some bands
If you talk shit, then you catchin’ hands
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle, Hustle
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle, Hustle
Man I be gettin’ that money
You niggas is broke yeah you bummy
I got all this shit, yeah it’s funny
I’ll do anything for the money

[Verse 1: Ca$hBoii]
Hustle Hustle Hustle
My niggas got that muscle
If Young Metro don’t trust ya
The gun gon’ get to bustin’
Yeah all my niggas be cashin’
We run to the money, we dashin’
My diamonds are water they splashin’
This song is so lit it’s an anthem
I got girls in Toronto
Miami, Cali, out to London
Credit cards never jammin'
Gun all black, it’s a Phantom
We are the modern Good Fellas
Plus, we rocking Margiela
We got money, we got hella
We already rich, don’t tell us

Cash Gang that’s the squad boy we hold it down
We the ones who run the streets we got em hot now
This song is so damn lit it caused a lockdown
If we don’t get the money now then we walk out
Young nigga, we fresh up off the block
Riding in the two seater screamin’ ‘Fuck the Cops’
All we do is ball nigga, we don’t ever talk
Wait until September when that fuckin’ mixtape drop
Pulled up workin’, my fingers they be hurtin’
I got yo main bitch in the condo, twerkin’ for a Birkin
Got money, my palms are itchin’
You talk a whole lotta shit, why you bitchin’
When I start talk to ya, you better fuckin’ listen
AK is fully automatic, no clicking
