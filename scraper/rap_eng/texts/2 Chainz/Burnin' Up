[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
Walkin' through the fire, please don't let me go
Take me to the river, I need you to know

[Chorus: Jessie J]
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out

[Verse 1: Jessie J]
Hot in the kitchen like a thousand degrees
That's how I'm feelin' when you're next to me
I got a fever, tell me, what did you do?
Temperature risin' when I look at you, look at you

[Bridge: Jessie J]
Subliminal, sex
Drippin' in, sweat
I'm losing my, breath
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Look what I've, found
It's 'bout to go, down
I want it right, now
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
Walkin' through the fire, please don't let me go
Take me to the river, I need you to know

[Chorus: Jessie J]
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up
Come put me out
Come and put me out

[Verse 2: Jessie J]
I got the matches, you got the gasoline
Light up the floor like it's Billie Jean
The way we're movin', by the end of the song
They're gonna have to pull the fire, f-fire alarm

[Bridge: Jessie J]
Subliminal, sex
Drippin' in, sweat
I'm losing my, breath
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Look what I've, found
It's 'bout to go, down
I want it right, now
(Huh, huh, huh, huh)

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie J]
Walkin' through the fire, please don't let me go
Take me to the river, I need you to know

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Everything hot like it's fresh off the grill
Million dollar grill look fresh on the hill
Plus I'm 6'5", she need to step in some heels
'Fore she step up in here you need to step up your gear
Wish a Lamborghini had four doors (four doors)
From the corner store to the corridor (corridor)
Me and my homie on the dance floor
White girl in the middle, looking like an Oreo
(I'm burnin' up)
Roof on fire, we can burn up
Turn down for what, nigga turn up
Motherfucker must ain't learn nothin'
Back in the day used to down with a burn coat
(I'm burnin' up)
Light got the Lord on the top floor
In a Ford, wearin' Tom Ford
Walk in the club and her ass start clappin'
Tell shawty I want an encore

[Chorus: Jessie J]
Come put me out
Come and put me out
I'm burnin' up [x7]

Come put me out
Come and put me out
