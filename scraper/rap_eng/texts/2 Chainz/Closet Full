[Intro: 2 Chainz]
I pull your bitch out the parking lot
Ask her 'What's happening now?'
Shit I left some ones on the floor
Now they got a green rug
Now who got a million more?
I give a fuck about them niggas
Got a baby dropping and my baby momma next

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I got a pistol in my tracksuit, you can see that shit bulging
Niggas know I'm 100, just got it off the oven
I don't really know how to act no more, you can ask my Mother
Came up off [?], southern fried with the biscuit
Got so many damn hoes, nigga I need an assistant
You really must a missed it, still swerving round inches
I don't give a fuck about the other side, you can go and ask a witness
Come through in a vintage
New grill like a dentist
Free my boys, got a sentence
Getting the shit to a finish
Counting money so damn long, I got a cramp in my fingers
Bitch what's happening now?
Countdown 'bout a thou'
Just hopped out the shower
Smelling like gun powder

[Hook: 2 Chainz][x2]
Closet full of choppers, what's happenin
Closet full of choppers, what's happenin
Nigga talkin shit got ammo
12 killin niggas on camera
Nigga talking shit, boy plotting
Nigga what happening? What popping?
Every time a nigga getting dressed, nigga grab a motherfucking Chopper

[Verse 2: Cap-1]
[?] for a hour
Jumped up, count me a bankroll
Jumped in the motherfucking shower
Got dressed, grab my Draco
Only wanted money and the power
Spanish bitch texting me [?]
Nigga this world here our's
And I've got drink by the case load
Riding round with all the cash on me, young nigga stay swerving
Forgiatos do it perfect
My bitch she bad, yeah perfect
My bitch she bad on a person
Pop a Molly and a Adderall
Caught a wave, yeah surfing
Crazy nigga, I ain't got it all
Birds baking, they chirping
Gun crazy with the catalouge
Pulling off closed curtains with the bitch like it's our honeymoon
Money going way, way up, got the trap jumping like a bungee cord
Stuffing work up in the running board
Told them all take a 100 for it, trap

[Hook: 2 Chainz][x2]
