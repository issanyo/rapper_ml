This gon' be your favorite song
2 Chainz

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
I'm tryna talk to you but the music too loud
Girl, I know a quiet place where we can vibe out
I ain't like your ex, you can let your guard down
Tell your girls you're with a real one, so they can calm down
Oh yeah, they can calm down
They saying I'm the nigga, that's the word around town
Oh yeah, that's the word around town
If you didn't know before, then I bet you know now

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby, you got everything that a nigga want
I just wanna put you on
And I just wanna see you with them Vickie's on
Better yet, with them off

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Fetty Wap]
Oh let's ride out (You got everything that a nigga want)
Oh let's ride out, yeah (You got everything that a nigga want)
I got the car outside if you ready (If you with it) (Outside if you ready)
Only if you ready (Ready)
Tell them valet niggas go and get it
(Go and get it) (Squad!)
Only if you ready (Ayy)
(Oh she ready)

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
Tell the valet go ahead and get it
From the ZooGang, I'm one of the realest
Got a bad ass body, you the illest
And this beat so hard, you gotta feel it, ay
I just fell in love with the west side
Come get high, let me take you on a jet ride
If you ready, I can show you what the set like
So fine, swear I see you with my left eye, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Fetty Wap]
Baby, you got everything that a nigga want (Yeah)
I just wanna put you on (Yeah)
And I just wanna see you with them Vickie's on (Yeah)
Better yet, with them off

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Fetty Wap]
Oh let's ride out (You got everything that a nigga want) (Oh, let's ride out)
Oh let's ride out, yeah (You got everything that a nigga want) (Oh, let's ride out)
I got the car outside if you ready (If you with it) (Car outside if you ready)
Only if you ready
Tell them valet niggas go and get it (Yeah, baby)
(Go and get it)
Only if you ready, yeah
(Oh she ready)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'm the type to send you to the spa
Same time try you in a car
I'm the type to pull up in valet
Pay a dub to park a quarter million dollar car
Jumped in the whip and I quote
She went from the pole to the floor
It ain't no stressin', you know I'm a blessin'
She'll get a real nigga award I should
I do her, no brake fluid
Everythin' a G, oh the way I run through it
You like when I spoon, yeah, make you sleep good
And then I pull it out and I make you talk to it, talk to 'em

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Fetty Wap]
Oooh let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Oooh let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Yeah, I got the car outside if you ready (If you with it)
Only if you ready
Tell them valet niggas go and get it (Zoo gang)
(Go and get it)
Only if you ready (Yeah, baby)
(Oh she ready)
(Yeah, baby) (Yeah, you got everything that a nigga want)
(Yeah, yeah baby) (Yeah, you got everything that a nigga want)

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
All the way from New Jersey, here to LA
You gon' hear this when your radio play
Cuffing Season 2 on the way
Got me one tryna hit the valet, yeah, babe
