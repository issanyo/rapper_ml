[2 Chainz Hook:]
Murder, Murder, This Right Here That Murder
Pulled the Car Out The Garage, They Screaming Bloody Murder
Murder, Murder Chalk Line Around Your Daughter
3 Cell Phones and I Still Don't Ever Call Her

[2 Chainz Verse 1:]
Murder, Murder, Smoking on that murder
If a girl out with me, Just know she Murder
Murder, Murder, Take Her Ass like Burglar
Then I put her on the loud and feed her turkey burgers
Murder, Murder, This is Bloody Murder
All This ice all over me, I should wear a thermos
Murder, Murder, Hit you with the Burner
Hit you with the burner, hit you with the burner

[Hook]

[2 Chainz Verse 2:]
Murder, Murder, yea I'm killing niggas beats
When I'm out of town and on the stage it's rest in peace
Murder, Murder Somebody call my lawyer
They said I was killing Tennessee when I was down in Florida
Murder, Murder, my shoes none than a quarter
Rapping with the murder team nobody wanna record us
Murder, Murder Listen to the chorus
Niggas wanna know how I get it when I get
Don't worry, Just know it's murder

[Hook]

[Kreayshawn Verse 3]
This right here is murderous
I'm Mama Kreay the Gangsteress
From the East to the West it gets dangerous
When you get that dough on display and shit
Bitches will be hating this
But my mind still climbs for greater-ness
That money that I'm playing with
Put a whole in your head with no blame for it
Saying it
I'm Kaying
Come back to the block and I'm spraying it
Delaying, I'm stopping it
Put a end to your life, I'm blocking it
Your career bitch, you was never on
I heard 2 Chainz blocked you off his phone
Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout to ho
Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout the doe

Hello.....
