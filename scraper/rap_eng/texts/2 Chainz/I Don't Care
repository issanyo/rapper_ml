[Intro: 2 Pistols, 2 Chainz & 100 Proof]
(Watch the smoke from my cigarette)
It's blood money, baby, 2 Pistols
(Baby, baby, baby)
All California shit (Yah)
No cigarette (2 Chainz!)
(Slowly rise to the ceiling)
Please, no cigarette, I'm ready (Tru)
(I don't care)

[Chorus: 2 Pistols & 100 Proof]
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Look, boy, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Boy, look you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)

[Verse 1: 2 Pistols]
Just vibin' to myself, man
Swisher Sweet full, blowin' on that great dane
Big dog shit, your bitch call me Max Payne
2 pistols, get it? Anyways...
I just landed on the West for a few days
I'm on that 405, roof gone, switchin' lanes
My California peach, she likes to role-play
Lights camera action, do your thang
And when she do it, do it (Do it), I can't complai
Pussy ass mouth, that's a triple play
You a nasty nigga, that's what them hoes say
I reply one thing...

[Chorus: 2 Pistols & 100 Proof]
(I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Look, boy, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Boy, look you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Left the supermarket (Yah), took the coup and parked it (Yah)
You can catch me frequently at Gucci shoe department (Tru)
I tell 'em, "Give me these in all colors"
And ain't shit changed, these all hundreds
True to my religion, promethazine my prescription (Uh)
I look in the mirror, that's my competition
Then I talk to myself, myself said, "What?"
I said "You a ill nigga, roll a blunt up" (Damn)
I do it for my hood, south side, A-town
All my dawgs movin' like Greyhounds, we paid for it
Grey car with black wheels, it's lookin' like a skateboard
I've been gettin' money since day one (Uh)

[Chorus: 2 Pistols & 100 Proof]
(I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Look, boy, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Boy, look you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)

[Verse 3: 2 Pistols]
...about nothin' but them Benjamins
26 inches lookin' like some ceilin' fans (Chop! chop!)
Down the block, candy apple red (Red)
With my Ruger that will shoot you like Simon said
This rap shit a blessin', I could've gone Fed (Free)
But a man 'cause [?] stuff [?]
Just ask about me, you coulda got them packets off me
Too many snitches in the street, so I'm rappin' sorry
New Ferrari, Scaglietti, bitch
You pussy niggas funny, Eddie Griffin shit
I'm with my white chick, nah she ain't super thick
Just call her Abby Wambach, her head game full attack

[Chorus: 2 Pistols & 100 Proof]
(I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Look, boy, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Boy, look you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)

[Outro: 2 Pistols & 100 Proof]
Yeah, it gotta make sense, man
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents, man
I'm talkin' 'bout stacks, man
Racks, man
Yeah, just let me get 50 20s, know what I'm talkin' about?
20 50s, 10 hundreds, stacks, man
Gotta make money, man
If it don't make money, man, I don't wanna talk about it
Shawty, if you ain't fuckin', I don't wanna talk neither
It's blood money, 2 Pistols
(I don't care)
