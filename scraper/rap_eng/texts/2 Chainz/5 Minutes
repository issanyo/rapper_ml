[Intro: K Camp]
Yeah
Yeah
'Bout 5 minutes
'Bout 5 minutes

[Hook: K Camp]
5 minutes she'll be suckin' dick
'Bout 5 minutes she'll be takin' pics
'Bout 5 minutes she'll be on my clip
And 'bout 5 minutes, she'll be with the shits
5 minutes, give her five minutes
5 minutes she'll be suckin' dick
5 minutes she'll be takin' pics
5 minutes she'll be on my clip
5 minutes, she'll be with the shits
5 minutes, give her five minutes
Five minutes, okay

[Bridge: K Camp]
Do the Hoochi-coochi, I say free my nigga Gucci
Bought a brand new tooli, let it mix you like a smoothie
Do the Hoochi-coochi, I say free my nigga Gucci
Bought a brand new tooli, let it mix you like a smoothie

[Verse 1: K Camp]
5 minutes I'ma take your bitch
Valet park the Rolls and just slide in
Got 5 hoes all on Supreme, take 5 minutes just to dive in
Squad goin' up like elevators
Five rings, five chains, hoe see you later
Five minutes, make a car get the whole thing
Broke boy still flex hoe with no chain

[Hook: Camp]
5 minutes she'll be suckin' dick
'Bout 5 minutes she'll be takin' pics
'Bout 5 minutes she'll be on my clip
And 'bout 5 minutes, she'll be with the shits
5 minutes, give her five minutes

[Bridge: K Camp]
Do the hoochi-coochi, I say free my nigga Gucci
Bought a brand new tooli, let it mix you like a smoothie
Do the hoochi-coochi, I say free my nigga Gucci
Bought a brand new tooli, let it mix you like a smoothie

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Take 5 minutes just to roll up
Take 40 minutes just to smoke a joint
Take 5 minutes just to pour up
Got me leanin' like a Jordan dunk
24's on an orange dunk
That Tropicana for the propaganda
5 minutes just to count a check
Take 5 minutes, spend it all on Ballies
Take five minute just to mount up
From the lot to the rim shop
5 minutes just to pull your bitch
When I pull up in a sling shot
Hold on let me check my watch
I be ready in about five minutes
Chanel number five, bond number nine
Tryna stay alive when it's summertime
When it's overtime, I'm in overdrive
Got my money straight, got it organized
Can't say you hoes are overqualified, damn
I'm on the south side, you on the outside
Five minutes get to pop pop
Trap house had a rottweiler
All this weed like a bonfire
I'ma 3rd strike like an umpire

[Hook: Camp]
5 minutes she'll be suckin' dick
'Bout 5 minutes she'll be takin' pics
'Bout 5 minutes she'll be on my clip
And 'bout 5 minutes, she'll be with the shits
5 minutes, give her five minutes
5 minutes she'll be suckin' dick
5 minutes she'll be takin' pics
5 minutes she'll be on my clip
5 minutes, she'll be with the shits
5 minutes, give her 5 minutes
5 minutes, okay
