[Verse 1: Mr. 2-17]
This one for my partners 'hind the wall
This one for my partners that got caught
This one for my partners down the road
I got partners that ain't coming home
I got partners spending they whole life in jail
I got partners that can't wait to catch a bail
I got partners guilty and they'll keep it real
But if they don't repent man they gon' go to hell

[Hook: Mr. 2-17]
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
They gave my boy a nick and he started crying

[Verse 2: Mr. 2-17]
They gave my boy a dime and he started crying
Then he hit the stand and he started lying
Your honor that gun ain't mine, your honor that gun ain't mine
But we got your, on tape sending bullets flying
Now he goin' down for a long time
At the wrong place, at the wrong time
Two kids and a baby mama left behind
I seen this here play out 'bout a thousand times
'Nother black man in the chain gang
'Nother black man tryna gang bang
Another black man in the system
I could've went to prison but I didn't, thank God

[Hook: Mr. 2-17]
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
They gave my boy a nick and he started crying

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
This one for my partners locked behind the fence
Doing anything to pay they mama's rent
Yeah, hard head made a soft rear
Snakes in the grass, I bought a John Deere
Really ain't got no fear, really ain't got no fear
Use a digi scale for a souvenir
Put my first spot in my mama's name
Zero zero zero then the comma came
I'm straight up out the streets, I'm tryna maintain
Cut from a different cloth, we not the same thing
Forty years old, tryna join the gang
Twenty-five years for a quarter thing

[Hook: Mr. 2-17 & 2 Chainz]
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
(don't do it)
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
(don't do it)
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
(woah)
They gave my boy a nick and he started crying

[Verse 4: Mr. 2-17]
If you ain't really 'bout it then stay out the streets
How you play with fire, don't expect the heat
When you in the streets you better watch your feet
Cause when you in the streets, them boys they play for keeps
When you in the streets you better watch your mouth
When you in the streets you better watch your house
If you in the streets you might not make it out
Man these streets ain't nothing you should play about
If you hit a lick you better run with it
If you in the streets just know what come with it
That's not the life that I chose, that's not the life that I chose
I chose the way of the Lord, for me He died and He rose

[Hook: Mr. 2-17]
Just don't do the crime, just don't do the crime
Man don't do that crime, man don't do that crime
Don't do the crime man, don't do the crime
If you can't do the time then don't do the crime
