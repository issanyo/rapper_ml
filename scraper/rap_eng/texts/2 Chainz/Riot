[Intro]
Spinz, what's happening, mayne?
You feel me? I told the whole squad, mayne
Cut it up!

[Bridge]
I say, damn right they got it, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
I said lame niggas be quiet, lame, lame niggas be quiet
Lame niggas be quiet, you in the presence of a real nigga
I said lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
Lame, lame niggas be quiet, you in the real nigga presence

[Verse 1]
I eat your girl up for breakfast, won’t save you no extra
Say she fucking with me cause a real nigga's her preference
Drinking like I'm from Texas, and you know I stay flexing
And if you don't know I go by Tity 2 Necklace

[Chorus]
I say, damn right I got it, damn right I'm 'bout it
Clique full of killers, please don’t get us excited
Yeah we smoking loud, so lame niggas be quiet
And if you fuck with us, we gon' start up a riot
I-I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot (yeah)
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot (2 Chainz!)

[Verse 2]
Ain't stunting these niggas, ain't stunting these bitches
Two cigarillos, look, look like extensions
Yeah I’m from the Southside, her mouth wide, my pack loud
My gat loud, I back out and click clack, pow pow
Court dates, skip trial, my rep is a reptile
Now and Later, alligators, I stepped on the work like a stepchild
Pimps up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I’m down, her phone off so don’t dial
This right here is that no style, I don’t know how I do the shit
I’m true to this, True Religion, they taking swag with no permission
All year, it's Gucci season, G's on my belt buckle
Cocaine on my left knuckle, kill you and bury what's left of you

[Chorus]
Damn right I got it, damn right I'm 'bout it
Clique full of killers, please don’t get us excited
Yeah I'm smoking loud, so lame niggas be quiet
And if you fuck with us, we gon' start up a riot
I-I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot (2 Chainz!)
