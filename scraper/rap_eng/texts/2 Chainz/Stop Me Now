[Intro]
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Ooohhhh Noooothing can stop me
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Oooohh Loving yoooooouuu
Nothing in the whole wide world can stop me
Nothing, Nobody
Can stop me from Loving you

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Foreign exchange, I walk in the rain
Still won't get wet
Nigga flick up the flame twist up the game
Switch up the chain
Play peek-a-boo I take ya girl and her friend
And do a switch-a-roo
Started with a nick and got a 62
It was memorable, my planets were digable
Used to stashing work off in a inner tube in middle school
I worked the trap no interviews
Just told shawty that im in to you
I'm the type that make a old school a Bentley coupe
Turn one to ten that's what I tend to do
It's an amber alert I gotta missing roof
It was black and it was travelling fast
I love you now I dont care about your ratchet past
Designer shoes, matching bags
Let them niggas pop shit baby we popping tags
If I ever fall off I'll be hopping back got a bad bitch with me
Told her hop in back my car speak she dark meat
I be eating MC's nigga shark teeth Velourz hoodie
I ask em whats for goody
If you are what you eat but I am not a pussy
You couldn't stop me with a bunch of Uzi's
And all we really do is shoot a bunch of movies

[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we at the top
Graduated from high school and bought a choppa
Orville Redenbacher bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl, Cindy Lauper
Started from the bottom now we at the top
Graduated from high school and bought a choppa
Orville Redenbacher bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl, Cindy Lauper

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
When they saw me they used to think of dope
But now when they see me they just think of hope
Inspiration no infiltration
Them niggas hatin I got they bitches naked
Hand full of ones pocket full of Hunn
If I was sellin swag man I woulda sold a ton
Designer sneaks leather seats
They say money talk thats why you never speak
Every verse I do is a rest in peace
Wish this highway to heaven had an extra seat rap game extra sweet
Big ass charm conversation peice

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
Million off rap but the trap was sweeter
When dealings on the block all prices cheaper
I been doing this since guess and fila
They say my entourage each car four deep eight heaters
Drop the middle man to cut the cost
They say my whole click cut from a different cloth
And of course we pay the cost, with each block that we off
You take off and call back it ain't our fault that ya lost ya lil bitch
Ask ya boy bout them forty he lost talk slick Glock
Forty ya boss now you the president
Fresher than peppermint
Whip tint till six bond number nine flow wall street bidness bitch
