[Verse 1: Eric Benet]
You tell me love ain't been goin your way
Cause you've been searching, but good ones are hard to find
Said you won't settle for less than your heart is asking
And life's too precious just to be wasting time, uh
Disappointment is something that's so familiar, uh
You get them hopes up high, to watch 'em fall again
So you stopped trying to find your one in a million, yeah
And the language of your love, can't nobody comprehend

[Hook: Eric Benet]
Well listen to this
See, I've got news for you
Cause you don't know how I do
I got ways to make you smile
They never knew about
In the corners of your mind
That no one has tried to find
Your time for love is through
Well, I've got news for you!
Uh, I've got news for you, yeah baby!

[Verse 2: Eric Benet]
Your body's glistening all over with satisfaction, yeah
I've shown you pleasures, girl
You thought you never feel
Said you were flying like the world was far below us
You said there's no way that I could take you higher still

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Rain hit the windowpane, five place lifts
[...], yelling pipe down to the pit
See the thunder and lightning really enticing
You sharp sticks for the bounty hunter rising
Net flick nights, I ball like the project and
Protect her less than one second undress her
This ain't no compressor, four doors or more
Yours truly got your girl going all for it
Floors is all marble, the clothes is all barber
That mean they trimmed down and tailored to fit proper
And you may need a doctor if you're sick and tired
Then I may need a tile cause I'm spending the night

[Outro]
Well, I've got news for you!
Uh, I've got news for you, yeah baby!
