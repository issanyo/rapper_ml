[Hook: Quavo]
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads

Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Fresh out, outta the bed, count up the deadz (bow, bow)
We heard what you said, we heard what you said
If I wasn't trappin', I'd be wrappin' up them bundles
If I wasn't rappin', I'd be trappin' out the condos (know I'm sayin')
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anacondas (know I'm sayin')
No forreal, no cap, I keep a sack like Sapp and Tucker (sacks)
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble (think about it)
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble (gone)

[Pre-Hook: Migos & Quavo]
You niggas in trouble (uh), you niggas in trouble (ay)
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda (uh)
You niggas in trouble (oh), you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble (ooh), you niggas in trouble
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble

[Hook: Quavo]
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads (fresh out the bed)

Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Gang bang, slang 'caine, heroin, half a ton
"Purple Haze", Cam'ron
Plays off a Samsung, get the job done
If I go jog at night, yeah, call it a mall run
You know what I did last night, 'cause I gave her all ones
You niggas in trouble, rock chains by the double
Got dames by the double, do everything but cuddle
Might buy a bowling alley, I got money out the gutter
Fully automatic, and it don't don't stutter (rra!)

[Pre-Hook: Migos]
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble

[Hook: Quavo]
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed

Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads
Uh, ooh, fresh out the bed
Uh, ooh, count up the deads

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Hop out the bed and I'm countin' them faces
I jump out the whip and them bitches start faintin'
No twenties or fifties, just Benjamin Franklins
Block on lock, call me Kurt Angle
I keep the banger, my brother, my partner
Don't fuck with no strangers, they tryna get famous
I put the hood on my back
When these niggas couldn't do nothing but love it
But niggas still hated
No they ain't real but these niggas gon' fake it
If they got a problem, my niggas gon' straighten it
Niggas debatin', they hatin', they plottin', they waitin'
They want my ice, tell 'em come take it
Have people tell me that I couldn't make it
Now I'm doin' shows outta state in the nations
My momma told me I gotta stay humble
But don't be too ready, you gotta have patience

[Verse 4: Offset]
Droppin' them bangers, bangers, bangers
Double cup stuffed full Texas Ranger
One in the chamber
I shoot a hundred round clip like Wilt Chamberlain
Go to the top and I'm gon' bring the gang in
Bitch, do anything to get famous
My wrist cost me a brick and it's frigid
I'm rich, but I did not let it change me
Statistics say that you niggas ain't gangsta

[Pre-Hook: Migos & Quavo]
You niggas in trouble (uh), you niggas in trouble (ay)
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda (uh)
You niggas in trouble (oh), you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble (ooh), you niggas in trouble
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble
