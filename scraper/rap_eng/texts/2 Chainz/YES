[Verse 1: Louisa]
Yo, whatever it is, you been thinking 'bout me
I ain't playing 'round no more
And I guess you found out that I ain't that innocent
I been what you're waiting for
Hey girls, what's up?
She bad, hands up
Yo boys, uh uh
Ease back, show love

[Pre-Chorus: Louisa]
Feeling so hot, wear a little less
Got a little something I'ma get off my chest
Blame it on my body, got you obsessed
Do it all night, better give me respect
We 20 deep up on this floor
We getting wild, yeah, we getting raw
No one can breathe, still want some more
If you're a freak like me one time, lemme hear you say yes

[Chorus: Louisa]
Come on, put your hands up
Here with all my friends, yup

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
Yo, did that grown man talk
Tryna get kicking so I brought my own phone
Real kamasutra, wearing Comme des Gar√ßons
This a Hurricane Maria doing songs of reggaeton
I am beyond
I am the truth, shawty I am the one
Tattoos of bible verses on my arm
Yeah baby, you the bomb
Somebody ring the alarm

[Chorus: Louisa]
Come on, put your hands up
Here with all my friends, yup
We about to get this started
If you know you can't stop and you know you won't stop
Take it to the after party
(Yes)
Now we getting all wet
Love it when I feel sweat dripping all over my body
(Yes)
(Yes)
Come on, put your hands up
Here with all my friends, yup
We about to get this started
(Yes)
If you know you can't stop and you know you won't stop
Take it to the after party
(Yes)
Now we getting all wet
Love it when I feel sweat dripping all over my body
(Yes)
(Yes)
(Yes)
