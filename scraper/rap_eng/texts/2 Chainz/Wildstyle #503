I can't think of nothing, but ain't no lame
Tell that nigga Spanks, stop wearing them fake-ass chains

[Lauren Flans]
James, James, James
You're wearing camouflage pants, that's not a good trick
Why make it even harder for the girls to find your dick?

[James Davis]
We been over here, Black Team, straight beastin'
And you guys suck more than the Lakers this season

[Pete Davidson]
Ras, you look good on my TV, but my picture is blurry
Your ass may be fat but you've got to lay off that curry

[Rasika Mathur]
See, it's not curry, it's cardamom
And if you don't believe me, just ask your mom
IT'S A SPICE REFERENCE

[Mikey Day]
Karlous, I roll with your momma, I go to the club, I'll bring her
I call her my bowling ball cause she needs three fingers

[Anthony "Chico" Bean]
You talking crazy 'bout the squad, but you know you don't really want none
This fat...loses his breath from playing Temple Run

[Nick Cannon]
Yeah, y'all cheated, y'all playing all wrong
When you know you got more hoes on y'all team than a 2 Chainz song

[Emmanuel Hudson]
Spank, you said you Googled me; he found one vid that erupted
Well, Spank, I Googled you too, and I ain't find nothing
MTV hit me up like yo, ? be hard
Wild'n Out the only thing you've got, fool, you NEED this job

[Conceited]
Yo, Rasika, you know I get crazy forever
You look like Kumar and Mr. Ed had a baby together
'Los, when will you cats really learn?
This...beard looks like Katt Williams perm
Chico, you know I'm the one for real, you're the one I kill
This ain't Fresh Prince why am I battling Uncle Phil

[Lil Duval]
At the end of the day, we really don't give a damn
We did this whole show just to post that bitch on instagram
