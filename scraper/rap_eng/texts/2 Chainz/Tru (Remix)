[Intro: Lloyd & 2 Chainz]
I lost it all, my friends, my loved ones
Alright
I want you to look at the mirror right now
I want you to ask yourself
Are you happy with what you see?
Are you happy with what you've become?
You know like, where you're going in life?

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Uh, no such thing as cold feet
How can I speak? I didn't have heat for a whole week
I boiled the water on the over, to the tub I dumped it
Back and forth, to survive, it may seem incompetent
I don't need a compass, I know where I'm going
Smoke filled lungs
Started doin' things
Stacked a couple coins
Who me? Shit, yeah
I pushed more blow than horns
To my loved ones, still can't sleep at night
Need an Ambien, an ambulance with lights
She said boy you crazy, I say girl you bright
Cause the ones I left behind was probably right
Think my cup of life got spiked
Sometimes pride won't let you express how you feel inside
Egotistical, very cynical, no where near my pinnacle
I hope me lovin' life offended you
You know I ridicule the witches brew
And, everything you heard God say about me true

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
Hey world, yeah I know it's been a while
Thought I'd come around to let you know what's up now
No album lately so my mind is kinda up, down
I still been taking care of mama in the somehow
Disappeared from the scene and left my old team
Had to find a new approach to an old dream
And it's not to take a shot at my old team
I just want you to see

[Chorus: Lloyd]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true

[Bridge: Lloyd]
I look up to the sky, Lord why do I cry
When no one is looking, is the blame for this pain
Even caused by the shame of this fame I've been given
My pride don't cause me to hide my true feelings
Cause I can only be real
Cause I can only be real

[Chorus: Lloyd]
This is me so please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
I'm just doing everything that I can
Cause all I wanna be is true
So please accept me for who I am
And please accept me for what I do
Cause there's no me without you
And all I wanna be is true
Alright, alright
And all I wanna be is true
Alright
And all I wanna be is true
And all I wanna be is true
Alright
