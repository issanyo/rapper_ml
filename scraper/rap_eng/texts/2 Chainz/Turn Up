[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turnt up, pockets full of hundreds
Shawty got a tan like she come from the Bahamas
I do this all night, man I should wear pajamas
Eatin' these rappers like a school of piranhas
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turn up
Got the Benz right in front us, all my friends on the come up
I'm like, damn, these niggas ain't a 100
Man I keep that shit a 100, all this bling cost me a 100

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turnt up, pockets full of hundreds
Shawty got a tan like she come from the Bahamas
I do this all night, man I should wear pajamas
Eatin' these rappers like a school of piranhas
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I got a recipe for my destiny, southside niggas to the left of me
Southside niggas to the right of me, southside niggas to the death of me
On Ecstasy, you couldn't fuck with me, gettin' money is my specialty
Got the game on lock, and I got a mothafuckin' extra key
Excellence is my pedigree, buy a car and seem petty to her
Then I paint the feet, call that shit a pedicure
Niggas on the road ain't gettin' no money, that's a petty tour
I can fuck your bitch, and act like I never knew her
She the shit, I'm manure, I'm a good pussy connoisseur
Keep it on the low, so sometimes I get pussy on the floor
I'm on top, so look down below, told y'all I'm 'bout to blow
I'm 'bout the dough, I count the dough, I cash out, then I'm out the door

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turnt up, pockets full of hundreds
Shawty got a tan like she come from the Bahamas
I do this all night, man I should wear pajamas
Eatin' these rappers like a school of piranhas
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up

[Verse 3: Cap 1]
I walked in, then I turn up
Then I set up on they muthafuckin' couch, roll the weed with a burner
Got a bad bitch, and I make her hold my liquor
She got her girl with her, she don't know that I've been hittin' her
Red bottom shoes with the spikes all on it
Pockets full of 100s, make all the bitches all want me
I be movin' through the city, 100 niggas comin' with me
On the road of riches, it was some bitches takin' pictures
Roll a 3-5, put together two Swishers
Movin' like a box, fuck around and get your issue
Man I'm pourin' up lean, got me drinkin' out the pitcher
Walkin' in, amd I'm so sag coolin'
Trueys on, they gotta fuck with my movement
Southside Duffle Bag, nigga we boomin'
Look at how I do it it, tell that I'm gettin' it
Plug on the way, I told that nigga 20 minutes
Ridin' real wheel through the city, nigga, pimpin'
First I go the Fifths, then I'm headed up to Lenox
Spendin' big bags, man I'm runnin' through a check
Work just in, got a pack in the jack
Show you how to move, niggas talkin' finesse
Probably cuff one, then I'm offin' the rest (Gone!)

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I walked in, then I turnt up, pockets full of hundreds
Shawty got a tan like she come from the Bahamas
I do this all night, man I should wear pajamas
Eatin' these rappers like a school of piranhas
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
Walked in, then I turn up, in then I turn up
