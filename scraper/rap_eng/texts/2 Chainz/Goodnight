[Intro]
If they keep on sleepin on me I'ma tell them bitches "goodnight"
If they keep on sleepin on me I'ma tell them bitches "goodnight"
If they keep on sleepin on me... Good night
Good night (x4)
I've been trappin and I got it for a good price!

[Verse 1]
She got 2 chains on her spine
2 Chainz on her mind
I say 2 Chainz all the time
I got 2 chains on right now
I'm turnt up right now
I'm turnt up right now
I'm turnt up right now
You said that shit already
They just a bunch of meat balls and I don't like spaghetti
I'm acting like R.Kelly
Left pissed off I'm on Pirelli's
I got a pistol in my Pelle
Bumpin' Trap-a-Velli
We gon' get it in!
Literally, criminally
Outfit came from Italy
Bad bitch come from Tennessee
1 time for my enemies
And shout out to my pinky ring
Toast up to the good life
The kids and a good wife
Put they ass to bed since they sleeping on me, Good night!

[Hook]
GOOD NIGHT (x4)
Eat em up, appetite
Got my money right, I got my fuckin' money right
GOOD NIGHT (x4)
Eat eat em up appetite
I got my money right, I got my fuckin' money right

[Verse 2]
They saying that I rap, I can't go back in the trap
Guess when I heard that? When I was back in the trap
Smoking back to back in the back of the 'bach
You niggas know me but they don't know Jack
Yeah Jack my engineer, all we do is persevere (yeah)
Jump on the beat like I'm doing it for Emmett Till
Jump on the track like I'm doing it for the Olympics
Money in my pocket got it looking like I'm limping
You can't see my vision, it's more then 20/20
It's more like 50/50 cuz I split it with my niggas
I do this with precision, I'm something like a welder
I'm over nigga's top, man I'm something like a shelter
Umbrella, pockets on Grizelda
I'll take off on you nigga, think I work for Delta
Take off on you shorty, 2 chainz what they call me
Keep on sleepin on me, they gon' need some coffee

[Hook]
GOOD NIGHT (x4)
Eat em up, appetite
Got my money right, I got my fuckin' money right
GOOD NIGHT (x4)
Eat eat em up appetite
I got my money right, I got my fuckin' money right
