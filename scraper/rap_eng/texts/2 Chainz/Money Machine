[Intro]
I told them, get on my level
Bitch, you could get on this shovel
Coke prices high, than which was if a Tony Montana
I just got me a bezel
My slippers is clean
All I wear Tru Religion
I paid a grip for them jeans
I got a lust for the cream
I need a money machine
I need a money machine
I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, but it ain't nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

[Verse 1]
I say I'm incredible, most legible
Schedule ain't, but I can make your girl flexible, edible
Put her top and call it putting her on my pedestal
You would never know, unless you worked at the bank
Camel toe, look like steak
And your boy look like great
2 gun bang
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane
You can tell your girl here, because a cab came
And I keep it 100, I don't need no spare change
Some do it for the fame, some do it for the fortune
Fortunately I'm famous, 26's wheel of fortune
And I been riding foreign since the fucking introduction

[Chorus]
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

[Verse 2]
Yo it's my time to shine, so I'm checking my Rollie
A bet with the Lakers, I bought a necklace off Kobe
I be fucking your girl, I was texting her only
I told her, "I'd like your legs better if they was open"
Ever since the beginning, niggas knew I was focused
Strip club tour started Magic, ended at Strokers
I'm a fucking example of a fucking example
Hit her from the back, nigga, that's a fucking example
I came up on Luke Campbell, I'm so sick I need Campbells
If you know I'm showing up, I hope you come with your camera
Got the city on swole with my Louis bandana
My car is shitting on niggas, I should ride with a Pamper

[Chorus]
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

[Verse 3]
I give you something to see when you are looking this way
If you approaching with the drama, then we approach with the K
And when you look in my eyes all you see is the pain
On medication, I can drink 200 a day
When you hot in the A, you get a spot in the A
It's so big that shit look like a spot in the A
These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line
Till somebody rhyme bout beating me, then they start dancing in line
And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30
With my ice on early, in all gold knight sterling
Try to cook a brick off a George Foreman
Take a girl, it'll start spoiling
Living room floor look like a nigga going bowling

[Chorus]
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
I need a money machine
I see you doing your thing, it ain't got nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

[Outro]
I say it's my time to get it, my time to shine
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind
It's my time to get it, my time to shine
I need a hustling trophy, it's my kind of grind, bitch
