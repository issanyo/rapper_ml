[Chorus]
2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feeling me, feeling you...
Everything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz

[Verse 1]
Breaking up with my ex was the hard part
Had to pull the ass out like the gar-bage
Bout to take this new thang to a pinnacle
You feel me, feeling you I ma-ssage your physical
Thank God... I'm spiritual
She ask me what I'm finna do I say get into you
One leg up followed by the other
Get a little head then I find a rubber
We don't talk on the phone - we Tiger text
That mean she send a few flicks and I send a check
You 'memba Shonda, the one that had a Honda
Good head on her, you can learn a lot from her

[Chorus]
2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feeling me, feeling you...
Everything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz

[Verse 2]
In the a.m. I think about her fragrance
When she met me I made her change all her statements
Not what she say... but what she bank
And how she think... I can't complain
On to the next one pro-gression
Keep the past and the present, separate
I got alotta spots like a leopard
One to trap in, one to have sex in
One to stack in, one to get dressed in
I'm getting married Ben Franklin my best man
3 cell phones she got all the numbers
I told her right then it was all or nothing
Yeah I'm on that loud I know you heard of me
Hair-weave killer, emergency
Hair-weave killer, I murder weaves
Hair-weave killer, murder scene

[Chorus]
2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind
Baby are you feeling me, feeling you...
Everything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time
Tell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz
