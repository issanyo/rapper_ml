[Intro: Timbaland]
DJ Timi Timb, on the 1's and 2's 'bout to give it to ya

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
I try, survive, K9's outside
What's life, I strive, I do it, you lie

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
This me, fuck it, this me, fuck it
Like this, fuck it, right here, fuck it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Get mine, take yours, go far, go hard
Go home, big mansion, front look like a backyard
This me, fuck it, touch me, bussin
My weed musty, treat the Porsche like a Huffy
Listen ladies, if ya nigga lame, then I don't wanna fuck ya
Listen ladies, if you ain't wanna waste things
Then I don't wanna hug ya
Big money, soldiers, slept on me, Folgers
My girl, gorgeous, both pockets, bulges
This me, that's right, pulled up, stop light
Got out, aight, aight, aight

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
This me, fuck it, this me, fuck it
Like this, fuck it, right here, fuck it

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Timbo, great, make beats like steak
Chef in tha booth, make niggas a plate
Make niggas relate, might dive in a lake
VA, banana clips, Planet of The Apes
Ain't no debate, ride like freeway
Ride like DJ's, if money talks, I'm on three way
Live life, get paid, been high since 10th grade
Fuck with me get ya rent paid, cuttin' up like a switchblade

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
This me, fuck it
This me, fuck it
Like this, fuck it
Right here, fuck it
