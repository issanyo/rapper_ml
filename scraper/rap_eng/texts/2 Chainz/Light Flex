[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Okay, yeah
Alright now, yeah

[Verse 1: Tone Stith & (2 Chainz)]
Looking like ooh la la (ooh la la)
Make 'em gather round, Kumbaya
Got 'em looking like oh my God
It's that new, new I know you ain't got (yeah)
I can't relate to nobody fake
Do my own thang, let 'em hate and tell 'em, "Bye, bye"
Bye, bye, bye
It's lit, alright, promise you can catch me
Vibing all night, I ain't playing no games
That's what I like, get it poppin', 5 lanes
Oh, you know I'm

[Chorus: Tone Stith]
Oh, I'ma hit 'em with the light flex
(Flexing) tonight, (flexing) oh, (flexing)
Oh, I'ma hit 'em with the light flex
(Flexing) tonight, (flexing) oh, (flexing)
Just a lifeless, for a, watch out, let me

[Bridge: Tone Stith]
Let me do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world
Do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world

Yeah, do it one time for the world
Do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world

[Verse 2: Tone Stith]
Ring alarms 'cause this ain't no drill (no drill)
You a snack, yeah, better yet, meal (full meal)
Walk in and the club on 10 (on 10)
Gotta flex, flex, flex for the real (for real)
I can't relate to nobody fake
Do my own thang, dead 'em all, yeah, go for the kill
It's lit, alright, promise you can catch me
Vibing all night, I ain't playing no games
That's what I like get it poppin', 5 lanes
Oh, you know I'm

[Chorus: Tone Stith]
Oh, I'ma hit 'em with the light flex
(Flexing) tonight, (flexing) oh, (flexing)
Oh, I'ma hit 'em with the light flex
(Flexing) tonight, (flexing) oh, (flexing)
Just a lifeless, for a, watch out, let me

Let me do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world
Do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world

Yeah, do it one time for the world
Do it one time for the one time

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(Yeah, yeah, 2 Chainz)
Heartbreaks and 808s
Turn around, one-legged fadeaway (swish)
Even with a beard, I got a baby face (no)
Head fake, crossover, hesitate (true)
I been workin' on my outside game (yeah)
3's start to rainin', thinkin' outside came
Keep my name on the jersey in all caps (caps)
Crossed over to my goal, overcame trap (trap)
Hangin' on the wing, waitin' for my shot
Ridin' through a hurricane in a drop top
Yellin', "Check ball," I'ma take it from the top
I can shoot from here or I can take it from the block

[Chorus: Tone Stith]
Oh, I'ma hit 'em with the light flex
(Flexing) tonight, (flexing) oh, (flexing)
Oh, I'ma hit 'em with the light flex
(Flexing) tonight, (flexing) oh, (flexing)
Just a lifeless, for a, watch out, let me

[Bridge: Tone Stith]
Let me do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world
Do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world
Do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world
Do it one time for the one time
Yeah, do it one time for the world
