Sometimes i feel like im a caged bird
Sometimes i dont know what to say, word
Sometimes i feel like i be moving birds
And now you know im gon be doing her
Sometimes i feel like im a caged bird
Dont know what to say so i stay slurred
We going hard im a free bird
Me and my nigga moving weight bruh

[Verse 1: Eddy Tarantino]
Too fly for a bird cage
Its going down like an earthquake
Let me get them cakes like its my birthday
Cutting hoes off that's sword play
Cut his ears off if he eavesdropping
Man i need a lifeguard with me
At all times because i got deep pockets
These niggas gon aim at ya head
Call me dough boy cuz i stay with the bread
I got so many pencils cuz i came with the lead
Ive seen it all i ain't afraid of the dead
Got them bitches with me fly like a bird
If you talk about money then i am concerned
And what i've learned is don't talk when the blunt burned
Counting so much money that my fucking thumb hurts

[Hook: Eddy Tarantino]
Sometimes i feel like im a caged bird
Sometimes i dont know what to say, word
Sometimes i feel like i be moving birds
And now you know im gon be doing her
Sometimes i feel like im a caged bird
Dont know what to say so i stay slurred
We going hard im a free bird
Me and my nigga moving weight bruh

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Drop drop it, lemme see you squat it
Type a nigga gettin' private dances in the public
Hit her from the back, grabbing on her shoulders
Hair weave killa, girl don't you get nervous
Clean than some detergent, fucked her and she told it
All my cars got curtains I love to light ginobili
My Rollie cost a car, and I don't have a car note
I took her from the bar to the car to the condo

[Hook: Eddy Tarantino]
Sometimes i feel like im a caged bird

Sometimes i feel like im a caged bird

We going hard im a free bird
Me and my nigga moving weight bruh
