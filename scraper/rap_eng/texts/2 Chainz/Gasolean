See I be rocking Truey and my belt by Louis
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'
See I be rocking Truey and my belt by Louis
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'

Yeah, I'm on that gas, and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say Yeah, I'm on that gas, and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say first I hit the gas then I lean
First I hit the gas then I lean [x3]

[Verse 1]
First I hit the gas turn it up and make it smash
Hit them with they Keith Sweat cause I'm a make it last
Yeah your bitch is like is and my car is like an outfit
Put some shoes on that bitch count money till I get arthritis
And my belt by Louis, and your girlfriend shoes
And keep your eyes on the road before you crash like a computer
And my money long when I shop I need them [?]
Shawty playing good, man I think I found the toe
Pull up in that two door, hop up out that two door
Yeah my name is 2 Chainz I'm about to put on two more
Stuntin' on you niggas if you knew more you would do more
And yeah they fucking with me the long way, detour

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't love them hoes, don't play me know I'm like
I'm trying to take a bitch like a [?] to hell
Everyday VIP the way I draw the lines
Told Shawty check your watch get that fucking ten
Ok, you're not on my mind, Shawty knows it's countin' time
Life is a getting chill, never ever penalized
Time for [?] trues and my low booze call
It's cold in the booth, I should rap in a snow suit
Get my truly sound, my Louies on
You do me wrong and you'll be gone
Ninety three octane got me gassed up
Hit it with the codeine dick now I'm assed up

[Hook]
