[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
This gon' be your favorite song
YFS

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
It's a whole 'lotta chicks in the livin' room, gettin' it on
And they ain't leaving till 6 in the mornin'
I've been tryna tell 'em, "Leave me alone"
They've been twerkin', it ain't workin', I been curvin' 'cause I'm focused on you
I'm tryin' to get you back to the telly
Tryna be your man if you let me
Baby girl, you so thick and you look so sweet
I just wanna taste your peanut butter jelly

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
While I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody
Uh, on your body-ody-ody
While I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody
Uh, oochie wally, wally, wally
You lookin' dangerous
I want you and it's obvious
We could be makin' crazy love
Whole world gon' be hatin' us
(Why they hatin?)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, on your body-ody-ody
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally, oh, baby

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Oochie wally, let me gon' and get it started
Lookin' like a molly dressed in Cavalli
Everythin' I do, it got gold on it
I just ate a 300 dollar hamburger
Change over, tell the lane that the game over
At the shootin' range, pinky ring, costs a Range Rover
Uh, do my thang for the pooty tang in the suit
Imagine Superman grabbin' Lois Lane on the booty
Told you from the jump, don't jump to conclusions
If you want a tan, put some sand on your booty
Used to have a tat of a man on the booty
'Til I covered it up with my hand on her booty

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Let me feel up on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, on your body-ody-ody
Let me feel up on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally
You lookin' dangerous
I want you and it's obvious
We could me makin' crazy love
Whole world gon' be hatin' us
(Why they hatin?)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, on your body-ody-ody
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally, oh, baby

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
I really, really, really wanna work your body
I really wanna make you scream and shout
I really, really wanna give it to you
I really really wanna turn you out
I really, really  wanna work your body
I really wanna make you scream and shout
I really wanna hear you call me papi
I really, really wanna turn you out

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
So let me feel up on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, on your body-ody-ody
Let me feel up on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally
You lookin' dangerous
I want you and it's obvious
We could me makin' crazy love
Whole world gon' be hatin' us
(Why they hatin?)
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, on your body-ody-ody
'Cause I'm feelin' on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally, oh baby
