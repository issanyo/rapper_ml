[Intro]
Okay bitch, okay bitch we goin' up
Okay bitch
June, you're a genius
Okay bitch, I'm in the zone
Okay bitch, I got a home that got a home that got a home
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Used to make hard, make it look easy
Take the top back and make it look Jeezy
Two double cups, make it look Weezy
Too much shrimp got me lookin' queasy
That's how I'm feelin' on the runway (the runway)
Outfit lookin' like the runway (runway, yo)
Every day I'm tryna get a couple stacks (couple stacks, uh)
Double park the double R then double back (skrt)
Known to give an old school a heart attack
Known to buy a new car if I got a flat
Better ask about me, bitch you better know (better know)
Okay bitch, this a AP, this a Rollie (this a Rollie)
You ain't never make it rain, Tony! Toni! Tone! (Tony)
Don't you know you're homophonic? Please, don't approach me (no)
Chronicles of the chronic and the Digi-scale (yeah)
A stripper pussy on my motherfuckin' fingernail

[Chorus]
Okay bitch, I run it up (yay)
Okay bitch, you goin' back (ayy)
Okay bitch, I'm from the trap (ayy)
Okay bitch, you heard of that (ayy)
Okay bitch, you know they flexin'
Okay bitch, you know we strapped (ayy)
Okay bitch, I'm from the Southside of town, you better ask
Okay bitch, we goin' up (ayy)
Okay bitch, I'm in the zone (ayy)
Okay bitch, I got a home (ayy) that got a home that got a home (ayy)
Okay bitch, we're goin' on (ayy)
Okay bitch, I got a pool (ayy)
Okay bitch, I got a pool (ayy) that got a pool that got a pool (yah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Versace for the weekend
The devil wear Prada, I'm a demon
A heathen, I gave the meat to vegans
The last time I hit the Gucci store, I had to sneak in
I'ma need a girl tonight, I need someone to sleep in
Pool in my backyard, I never stuck my feet in
Rapper made the league and your pockets look petite
Okay bitch, I'm goin' off (okay), okay bitch, I got that sauce (okay)
Okay bitch, I'm on (okay) a double (okay) date, it's her and Nina Ross
Okay bitch, I got across, layin' on top another cross
Layin' on top another cross, I'm killin' 'em, sorry for your loss
Somebody gotta call it off, a lot of bodies haulin' off
The marble floor and countertop, I got a gun know how to talk
I got 'em scared, I don't lie (lie)
Legends don't die (no), where would I be if I ain't try? (uh)
Remember Troop came through Godby Road with AI
Gucci slippers on, nigga, you could never tie
Alright

[Chorus]
Okay bitch, I run it up (ayy)
Okay bitch, you goin' back (ayy)
Okay bitch, I'm from the trap (ayy)
Okay bitch, you heard of that (ayy)
Okay bitch, you know they flexin'
Okay bitch, you know we strapped (ayy)
Okay bitch, I'm from the Southside (ayy) of town, you better ask
Okay bitch, we goin' up (ayy)
Okay bitch, I'm in the zone (ayy)
Okay bitch, I got a home (ayy) that got a home that got a home (ayy)
Okay bitch, we're goin' on (ayy)
Okay bitch, I got a pool (ayy)
Okay bitch, I got a pool (ayy) that got a pool that got a pool (ayy)

[Outro]
Ayy, mmm, mmm, mmm
