[Intro]
Gon' make me take a shot of, gon' make me take a shot of apple Crown. Ain't no apple Crown? Uh Cap, that's all Cap

[Pre-Hook]
I'ma talk that shit them niggas wanna hear
Yeah, nigga drinkin' lean like he drinkin' beer
Told him one time, it was our year
That was last year... now the cash here

[Hook]
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you

[Verse 1]
I drop two verses, they on god level
One goin' state, one goin' federal
I get so busy, don't know what to tell you
Man I had to put love somewhere on my schedule
Ain't no time for that
I had to grind for that
I got the diamonds check
You gon' rewind it back
Nigga I'm so fly, I got the pilot back
.44 Bulldog, Iâ€™m tryna find a vet
From head to toe, I'm wearin' designer hats
If not, I'm somewhere tryin' on a designer hat
One Rolex, one AP
One black and white, one HD

[Hook]
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you

[Verse 2]
Got my joint filled, with the real killa
Where I come from, my bedroom was real little
Now I'm mansion status, in my apparatus
When they bring my check, I start cabbage patchin'
What's cappin', captain? Around the mat relaxin'
When she look down, I know that's chain reaction
I done been through it, I got a pain reaction
Introduce me to your nigga, I had a lame reaction
Had me all itchin' and shit
I come through on the blitz, I had the shoe with the kit
I got an ink on my body, made the drophead do karate
If I was in a dunk contest, I would jump over Ferrari

[Hook]
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you
One Yeezy Boost, one Yeezy boot
How a nigga do, jumpin' out the roof
Need a parachute, got a pair of coupes
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you
Yeah the paramedics gon' have to carry you
