[Intro/Pre-Chorus: Joi]
Three shots in, baby we too live
Record player spinnin' on 45
Minnie Riperton, Funkadelic, and Rush
Kiss me like you mean it then pass the kush

[Hook: Joi]
Gonna fuck you later, first pass the kush
Kiss me like you mean it
Three shots in, baby we too live
Record player spinnin' on 45
Minnie Riperton, Funkadelic, and Rush
Kiss me like you mean it, then pass the kush
Gonna fuck you later, first pass the kush
Kiss me like you mean it, then pass the kush

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
For my therapy, I roll some celery
Go on a shopping spree, all about monopoly
She looks so good on top of me
Helicopter on my property, propellers properly
I got on a wife that got everybody watching me
My philosophy, I like the no-panty type
If I don't smoke one, I ain't got no appetite
Yo, this art of war, I'm the rap carnivore
Treat the shit like Carnival
Stop playin' wit' me, boy
All the shit that I endure
This a suite, that's a room
I'll sleep in a tomb
Flo' clean, no broom
Codeine, no spoon
Drinkin' straight out the bottle
Buy a pint just to gargle
Pockets deep, I need goggles

[Pre-Chorus: Joi]
Three shots in, baby we too live
Record player spinnin' on 45
Minnie Riperton, Funkadelic, and Rush
Kiss me like you mean it then pass the kush

[Hook: Joi]
Gonna fuck you later, first pass the kush
Kiss me like you mean it
Three shots in, baby we too live
Record player spinnin' on 45
Minnie Riperton, Funkadelic, and Rush
Kiss me like you mean it, then pass the kush
Gonna fuck you later, first pass the kush
Kiss me like you mean it, then pass the kush

[Outro: Joi (2x)]
Sticky sweet flowers, they take me higher like your love
Now twist 'em up and break me off
Now twist 'em up and break me off

[Backwards] Kiss me like you mean it (Repeat 4X)
Gonna fuck you later, first pass the kush (Repeat 2X)
Kiss me like you mean it (Repeat 2X)
Three shots in, baby we too live
