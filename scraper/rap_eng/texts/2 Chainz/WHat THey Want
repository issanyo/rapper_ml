[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Might pull up in my bucket
This nine holds a good dozen
Might slide up in your cousin
Just made a mil' and still thuggin'
Niggas banged on me but they should've shot me
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him
Court date, but I skipped the bail
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
Got a hat say Figg' on my gangsta tip
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch
I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coat
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy, want a piggyback
Rock cremation, then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating 'til my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
'Til Tito kilos come off that boat

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly
This the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
If you see my watch I might hit it
If you see my check I might hit it
If you see my house I might hit it
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
This the shit that's from me
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
Treat my Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice
Graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bankroll (stand on your bankroll)
Nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po-lice
When I was poor with no lights
When I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches
Oh Lord, she in Christians
All gold for my Adventist
Pulled it down and she kissed it
All gold where my wrists is
God'll judge, no conviction
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word 'round town, I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say "Que pasa with the pesos?"
Promethazine codeine, caseloads (T.R.U.)
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll!

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly
This the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
If you see my watch I might hit it
If you see my check I might hit it
If you see my house I might hit it
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
This the shit that's from me
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
100k in my trunk
Keep that bitch with that donk
She gon' pop in them heels
She must heard of my deal
She gon' roll on them pills
Just don't grab on my hat
This that shit that's Iraq
This that make you climax
This that shit you just bought
This that Q go hamhawk
This that car that won't park
Pedal to floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop
Oxymoron in stores
Come in, kids, lock the door
Knock-knock-knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top
Could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill
Get them slugs off for real
This that curl with the gel
We gon' win, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell
Leave that punani killed
All them hoes run to Q
Spit that truth,make the loot
Expensive whips, we hotbox
Spent 2 bills on my socks
This that make you cockblock
This that make me pop shot
This that filthy convo
This that must be Figueroa

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly
This the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
If you see my watch I might hit it
If you see my check I might hit it
If you see my house I might hit it
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
This the shit that's from me
This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want
