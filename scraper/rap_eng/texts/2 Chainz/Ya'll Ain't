[Intro]
I don’t know what it is
I ain’t even been here
This is like I come
Home, I hear shit
And they whispering, it was like they sneak-saying shit

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I’m winning, I don’t know naan niggas here
Came in this motherfucker by myself
Smoking on strong, holding on my dick like oh!
My gold on, I'm the bomb
I’m talkin’ gold mine, niggas takin’ shots at me
I send ‘em back, I tell ‘em hold mine
Now touchdown, goal line

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Y'all ain’t killing shit
Yeah, y’all ain’t killing shit
I’m on my millionaire shit
My black leather and my yellow bitch
So tell your bitch to go tell a bitch
I got a better bitch, ever since
I’ve been booming

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
The bitch I’m with, looks just like she clueless
Work tape, to her bra she movin’
Daddy U-Haul, no RuPaul, there’s no gay shit
No fake shit, I’m from the A, bitch
That gun talk, conversation
Fire!

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Bitch I’m with, look just like she Cuban
I met her in Miami by the pool and
My closet, so big we can play hoop in
Got your bitch in my living room and she droolin’
Damn

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]

Yeah, I got brain, don’t need a tutor nigga
No days off, a Ferris Bueller nigga
Computer love? You gettin’ love on a computer nigga?!
Damn!

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Verse 5: Cap-1]
Yeah, ever since we been boomin’ nigga
C4 we had detours and we stay on top of that moolah nigga
Got another chick, with another bitch
And another chick that look sexy with me
Got a hundred bottles with the sparkles coming
Turnt up in my section
Getting it like boom!
In the streets with that product
All we hold is them choppers
Soufside and that’s with an F
And that F still stand for fuck these niggas
Got a red bitch, and her head sick
And her ass fat, and we still get rich
Gone
