[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm gonna cause pandemonium
Pick up the paper, custodian
This how Prince met Apollonia
Tryna fill up California kings
Hydrocodeine with the Visine
Master bedroom on the right wing
This a Philippe not a Breitling
Fuck her to sleep, she had pipe dreams
Yeah, this is the king of the trap
Yeah, I pull it straight out the hat
Yeah, everyone better take cover
Yeah, got rappers under attack
Uh, my daughters inherit arrogance
And they intelligent, that's a fact
Bought me a car February 1st
You already know it was black on black
I cover my scars with the tats on tats
You better back back, rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
I pass you a joint, better pass it back
I went to Montgomery, with packs on back
Sent her to the store for some plastic bags
Sent her to the store for some rubber bands
I started pitching so easy
I throw the work to you underhand
Underworld, underground, underline
I'm underdog and you under mine
This here ain't no once upon a time
This really happened for real
Can't even trust our own government
Aw man fuck all that humble shit
Mumbling
Man fuck all that mumble shit

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Realize
A lot of these niggas tell real lies
They not about shit in real life
And thats something that I had to realize (Realize)
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it
(reco-reco-recogni-i-ize)
They see me winning and now they dont liiike it
(Yeah, I know they dont like it)
Act like they love me, but hate me in pri-i-vate
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
I went and copped a ring
I call this rock, Dwayne
Johnson, stop the playin'
Man, I cannot complain
I left my shades in Atlanta so I told my pilot to stop the plane
He bust a U in the air
She say she doin' it, where?
She wanna sit in my chair
But she could never be my heir
Checks, clear, Bible, swear
They ain't buggin', I go off
Asahd Khaled with the cloth
Dwayne Carter of the north
Dwayne Wade in the fourth
New dream house for mommy
Keep 'Caiah in Armani
Putting my nieces through college
This for Kellise and Imani
Look at these niggas I put on
All of these niggas I'm good on
My own two, what I stood on
That's why their necks what I'm keepin' my foot on
I've been winning 8 years consistently, at least respect it
Papoose wrote a Ether record
But I broke Aretha record
See this is chess, not checkers
You can not check the checkers
Did Nas clear that "Ether" record?
Nah, but I broke Aretha record

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Realize
A lot of these niggas tell real lies
They not about shit in real life
And thats something that I had to realize (Realize)
I had to reco-reco-recogni-i-ize it
(reco-reco-recogn-i-ize)
They see me winning and now they dont liiike it
(Yeah, I know they dont like it)
Act like they love me, but hate me in pri-i-vate
I had to reco-reco-recogn-i-ize it
