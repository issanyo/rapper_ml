[Chorus]
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya

[Verse 1]
I wear Versace like it's Nike, you don't like it do you
I bet you feel this bankroll if I bump into you, oh yeah
Chopper bullets flying errywhere, pop pop pop
Got them chopper bullets flying errywhere, uh
.223 chopper clip as long as Stacey Augmon
In the restaurant I order 2 fried lobsters
Napkin on my Balmains, smokin' with lil mama
Like fuck your baby daddy, his daddy should've worn a condom
All these grams on me, all these bands on me
Make her want to dance on me and put her hands on me
Sprinter van on me, I got them xans on me
Driveway so damn long by the time I leave I'm damn asleep

[Chorus]
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya

[Verse 2]
I done put so many on I can't fall off
Trying to see how much the West End Mall costs, oh yeah
I might buy a Maybach and paint it all gold
Buy a crib fill the rooms up with all stoves
Wish I could tell you what she doing to me
Pocket full of money that's bluer than the sea
I feel like I just paid off the plug
Drop the top off the whip, hair-line receding
High last night so I woke up this evening
Can't pimp me so don't you tip me
Rims on the car make it six feet
So I can park the car wherever the blimps be
I want a bird for my birthday, I drink syrup with no pancakes
Yeah, bitches round my pool, I make them hoe look like my landscape
Yeah, El Chapo J R R, multicolor A.R. rules
Looking like I play ball, tell 'em keep they day jobs

[Hook]
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya
