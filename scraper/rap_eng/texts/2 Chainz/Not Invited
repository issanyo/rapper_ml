[Intro]
Of course I'ma stunt
Of course I'ma stunt
Of course I'ma stunt
Of course I'ma stunt

[Hook]
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited

[Verse 1]
I don't have to front
I park in the front with the trunk in the front
Make me a profit a month
Whether I get it or don't
I'ma go hard, I'ma stunt
I'm puttin' gas in the joint
I'm puttin' oil in the blunt
I do this shit for the Park
I do this shit for the Point
I do this shit for the 'Vard
I do this shit cause you boring
I am the man in this muthafucka
I got them bandz in this muthafucka
You know what I'm sayin', hand full of Xans
Nigga not playin' in this muthafucka
Put me a deuce in a Brisk tea
Couple of chains on the Crims tee
Tell me how I met a bitch one time and she talkin' 'bout she miss me

[Hook]
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited

[Verse 2]
She fell in love with the Percocet
She like the one with a ten on it
She like the Benz with the fins on it
She like the Benz with the lens on it
She like the Benz with the rims on it
And my turbo got them twins on 'em
All of my partners got bandz on 'em
So tell me what the fuck you sayin' huh?
You exotic baby, you special
Go and send me some nude pictures
You so fine, it's a damn crime, you gon' end up on a news special
You exotic baby, I'm fuckin' with you
You exotic baby, I'm workin' with you
And I'm smokin' on exotic
Got Chanel on her body
Might meet her in the lobby, used the earth as my ashtray
"Give a fuck" is my last name, "I don't" is my first
This for my ones, like November first
Walk around with two cups, like I'm always thirsty

[Hook]
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited
All of my hoes is exotic
None of your hoes is invited
All of my hoes is exotic (None of your hoes. none of your hoes)
None of your hoes is invited

[Bridge]
None of your hoes, none of your hoes
None of your hoes, none of your hoes
None of your hoes, none of your hoes
Ain't none of your hoes, none of your hoes
Ain't none of your hoes, none of your hoes
None of your hoes, none of your hoes
None of your hoes, none of your hoes
They can't get in, they can't get in
Yeah, It's a real nigga party
It's a real bitches party
See that vibe right here, you dig?

[Outro]
Thousand dollar shoes on your sofa
My other trap nigga watchin' Oprah
My other trap nigga watchin' Ricki Lake
I'm a trap nigga servin' shake and bake
I'm a trap nigga, serve you shake and bake
We in the back of the bando
Ammo like "Commando"
Pit bark in the front yard
Ain't no key for the top part
I'm allergic to cop cars
All these F's on my rims, fuck report cards
