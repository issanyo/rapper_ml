Rest in Peace Pimp C, Rest in Peace Pimp C, Rest in Peace Pimp C
Rest in Peace Pimp C, Rest in Peace Pimp C, Rest in Peace Pimp C

[Hook]
Take it off bitch, bend over let me see it
Take it off bitch, bend over let me see it
I say take it off bitch, bend over let me see it
Ta-take it off bitch, bend over let me see it

[Verse 1]
I've been the guy, look in the sky
Rain hit my building make my window cry
My uncle on that gin that's like genocide
We got them pillow sacks we can have a pillow fight
When my girl left I wasn't feeling right
And despite she extra nice
She start catching feelings I'mma catch a flight
She say I hurt her feelings now she dating dykes
I'm glad this ain't no movie you ain't acting right, tell her!

[Hook x2]
Take that shit off, bend over let me see it
Take that shit off, bend over let me see it
I say take that shit off, bend over let me see it
Take that shit off, bend over let me see it

[Verse 2]
I say take that shit off, bend over 10 soldiers
We the opposite of being sober, girls on each shoulder
Codeine and cream soda different weed odors
California, you can smell it in a coma
They say the world is finna end so I made me a bucket list
All I wanna do is just fuck so this my fucking list
Even if we ran us a train you couldn't fuck wit' us
And yeah I got me a bankroll I need a buncha ones

[Hook repeated]

[Outro x3]
They hollering Pimp C back, now what the fuck is up
Pimp C back, now what the fuck is up
