[Verse 1: D-Moe]
All I see is the money
Money
I'm blind to the haters
I'm looking at the world through these Gucci aviators
Smoking purple cannabis
Drinking purple activist
The dope I make a back flip
Counting cash is calculus
My life in LA is extravagant
Now I rock Versace
That Louis and that Gucci shit is average now i'm sorry
My Bentley all white and my pistol all black
Mini mac extendo clip
Niggas straight from Iraq
Niggas want that loud pack
Well I guess my shit showing
They say i'm 100 but i say i'm 1000
Big ass mansion statues fountains
Cocaine mountains kilos ounces

[Hook: D-Moe]
The man with the bands
The man with the vans X8

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I let the hatters be my motivators
What goes around comes around like a roller skater
This shit's so gravy you niggas mashed potatoes
Add up my outfit you need a calculator
Yeah! We them did it all they trying vindicators
I keep this motherfucker pumpedlike a generator
If I wasn't so good in the trap or the rap you know me I'd probably play for the Lakers
This shit is [?] and i'm pit bull and you a shitzu so don't me growl cause when i do ill pull out the pistol
Louis glasses cost more than your rent do
And i got a little message for the haters "go kill yourselves and call me later"
Rims so tall I ain't see Nathan
I ran a train on my girl with Ben Franklin

[Hook: D-Moe]
The man with the bands
The man with the vans X8

[Verse 3: D.D.M.S]
I got a mountain full of diamonds just sitting on my pinky
With thousand dollar shades on face when you see me
I'm the man I'm the man that's why these niggas wanna be me
With spikes on my shoes like i'm running for a titty
If you know what them is then you know the bottom bleedy
My hustle up nigga D.D.M.S who I be
D-Moe put me on up now i'm [?]
Now i'm pimping in Hawaii

[Hook: D-Moe]
The man with the bands
The man with the vans X8
