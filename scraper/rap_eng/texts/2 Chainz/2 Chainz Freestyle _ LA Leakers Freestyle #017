[Chorus]
Pretty Girls Like Trap Music, that's me
Pretty Girls Like Trap Music, that's me

[Verse 1]
MAC-11 and the crack I'm sellin' in my DNA
Frito-Lay, Aston Martin there's no need to kid and play
Pick a day, bet I'll pull up on your ass with dealer plates
Paper plates was my dinner plate, you prolly can't relate
This that Dre mixed with 3K, Wayne and Kanye
Andale, want no bullshit, no need to perpetrate
Purple drank in that dirty cup, down south MC Eiht
Down south MC Eiht, LA call me down south MC Eiht
Half a million for the restaurant I have to renovate
Man, I got so many demons, please don't make me demonstrate
I know trappers, rappers, actors, got the Phantom 'fore the mansion
Man that's backwards, ass-backwards, I'm a bachelor and I'm handsome
And I'm straight up off the porch, and I landed in a Porsche
And I ended on The Source, man I'm on the right course
Turn your body to a corpse, turn this beat into a corpse
Turn this beat into a body then shake and bake like Ricky Bobby, woo!
Crib so big the livin' room like a lobby, woo!
I can damn near fit a pool in the lobby, woo!
Got your girl in here 'bout to drool in my lobby
Cuz is a Blood, he like to bool in my lobby, yeah

[Chorus]
Pretty Girls Like that Trap Music, that's me
'Bout to drop that shit around June 16th
Pretty Girls Like that Trap Music, that's me
'Bout to drop it on your ass June 16th

[Verse 2]
First I met the plug, then I met his sister
Bought 20 packs, then I turned around and kissed her
Then you know I left, I been left, Derek Fisher
Had a lot of prize, but I'm tryna get richer

[Chorus]
Pretty Girls Like That Trap Music, that's me
'Bout to drop it on your ass June 16th
Pretty Girls Like That Trap Music, that's me
'Bout to drop it on your ass June 16th

[Verse 3]
Man I got a dog, I paid 10 G's for it
Fucked up her hair and bought a quick weave for it
Somebody please come and get these boys
L.A. Leakers, come and get these boys
Smokin' on the loud, man I'm known to bring the noise
This ain't Santa Claus when I'm comin' with the toys
Got a duffle bag, man I got a duffle bag
Got them suckas mad, man I got them, woo!
