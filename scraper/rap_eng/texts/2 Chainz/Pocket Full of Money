[Verse 1]
Half a million, I'mma stuff it
All the fucking jewellery like a treasury
This a bunch of rats chasing cheddar
I think I fuck the same if I met her
All I wanted was a Mazi
Bought a new crib, don't show deposit
All a nigga talk is still talk
Ran up a cheque and start walking, bitch start jogging
Fam call me Tity
And all the fans call me 2 Chainz
Riding a sedan through the city
Parallel park in front of blue flame, me and my boo thang
You wanna see my vision, you gon' need HD
I'm tryna get my dog registered like UKC
I'm so far ahead, baby, you can't see
And my future so bright, nigga, you can't see

[Pre-Hook]
I got some bitches in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of money and my homeboys do too

[Hook]
Pocket full of money and my homeboys do too
Pocket full of money
I got a pocket full of money and my homeboys do too
Pocket full of money
I got a pocket full of money and my homeboys do too
Pocket full of money
I got a pocket full of money and my homeboys do too
Pocket full of money

[Verse 2]
Half a million on the dresser
I got the plug on [?]
Smoke so much raw, I'm like a tester
One phone call and it undress her, yessir
I count by 10s, comprehend
Got a hoe a Benz, now we're twins
On the sidewalk with a sign
Yeah bitch, said today we selling dimes
Chopper barely [?]
Everything I got is from the asphalt
You can't blame your jeans, it's your iPhone
I told her drop it down, scrape the asphalt

[Pre-Hook]
I got some bitches in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of money and my homeboys do too

[Hook]
Pocket full of money and my homeboys do too
Pocket full of money
I got a pocket full of money and my homeboys do too
Pocket full of money
I got a pocket full of money and my homeboys do too
Pocket full of money
I got a pocket full of money and my homeboys do too
Pocket full of money
