[Hook]
Scared money dont make o money
Scared money dont make o money
Scared money dont make o money
If I ever go broke, Ima take your money

[Verse 1 - N.O.R.E.]
Im on my north side feeling shit
South side furious, that boy and hes back
And that boy is furious
Them chicks give me head on they periods
Make them run three somes, cause they are a little furious
Scared money, they dont make enough
You wanna go to war, you dont make enough
Have my niggas in your crib when you waking up
You know what this is right? Give me errything
They dont want that type of beef so they wanna squash it
Know nores a shooter, I dont miss my target
And fuck it Im a rider
Magnums strapped tight so Im busting all the sider
Nobody dies a virgin, life fucks us all
I was born poor, but was raised to ball
Im a grown man, pay my own bills
Great money, I pay my own thrills

[Hook] x2
Scared money dont make o money
Scared money dont make o money
Scared money dont make o money
If I ever go broke, Ima take your money

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz]
If I ever go broke, joke
If if I was a theft Id be outside the liquor store
I wrote the sushi, we trap about the studio
And everybody know that Im dead fresh, funeral
I came up from a 10 speed to 10 chain
Switch lane, change gears, get brain
I jumped out before the ship sank
Everybody looking at me like a fish tank
Word, I backed out in my glass house
I walked in with the choppa and they ran out
Now, I take your girl to my man spot
Ain't no games but Im playing with my X-box

[Hook] x2
Scared money dont make o money
Scared money dont make o money
Scared money dont make o money
If I ever go broke, Ima take your money

[Verse 3 - Slim The Mobster]
I get that duffle bag crack money
Always got the mac on me
If you got a problem then you can't get that homey
When it's ?
Without fronting got niggas killed
Knowing they couldn't afford it
Yeah, my fortune's called fortune my connect just got deported
My cocaine ain't get imported
My money inside important
Squeeze 23 piece on Ferrari, bet I score like Michael Jordan
?
You trying to stop me ?
Yeah my gun be talking loud and I can't turn that down
But the money I'm getting out, they make a choir the sound
Fuck around I let them sing like the choir's around

[Hook] x2
Scared money dont make o money
Scared money dont make o money
Scared money dont make o money
If I ever go broke, Ima take your money
