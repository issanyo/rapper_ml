[Verse 1: Count]
Grinding all winter, now I'm back for the summer
Throwin' Hundreds out the sun roof cause I'm a stunner
Thought she was the one till I heard she was a runner
Went behind her back gave all her friends my number
She roll another blunt up, blowin' till I pass out
Made it rain twenty racks still pullin' cash out
Mashed out the lot made the Vet' do a tailspin
Pipes growlin' like a pit bull at the mailman
Got buyout money check, got shooters on deck
That's why I walk around with thirty-thousand on my neck
They show respect because they know my background
It's summertime, tell them bitch niggas I'm back now


[Bridge: Mooney]
Pockets so thick like I just hit the number
Ran through it all now I'm back on the come-up
Pulling something slick that'll make these niggas wonder
Told y'all bitches I'd be straight by the summer

[Hook: Count and Mooney]
Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/I'd be straight by the summer

Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/I'd be straight by the summer


[Verse 2: Mooney]
I-I-I ain't got nothing else to tell you
Promise I'll be straight while y'all was expecting a failure
Fucking up ya' plans though, sweet taste of victory
So for the time being y'all relaxing when it's history
Porsche Panamera, or the White Maserati
I'm doing me but these all hoes is for everybody
Ran through it all, but homie I will never fall
When the club make it rain that shit is like a mating call
Pockets just like I won the mega millions
It bring me great pleasure to know I hurt these niggas feelings
Whatever you do I always got 1-up
Had a rough winter, but I'll be back by the summer

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Cargo shorts white V-Neck
Big feet on the car like a T-Rex
I got my music up and my top perm
That means its laying down 24's on the curl
Twenty birds on the stove I get it cooked cheap
Three birds everyday it's been a good week
Sold two birds Sunday cause I went to church
And since it's summertime I guess I'm going with the Verse
All these chains on a nigga need two necks
I don't fuck with groupies but I have group sex
2 Chainz name ringing like a telephone
And all I eat is beats, and yellowbones


[Bridge]
