[Hook]
I got no roof and no ceilings
I used to have a top but then I lost it
50k no chilling
I make these bitches dance til they exhausted
I'm cold blooded no feelings
I used to have a limit but then I lost it
I'm having fun, a ton of ones
I came into the club and I tossed it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Top off like a toupee
Been looking for it like two days
Drink rose like Kool-aid
Talk so sweet I got a  tooth ache
Phone book in my True Religions
60 grand thats a lot of hundreds (racks)
Gettin' wasted, goin' ape shit
Swag so sick it'll make you vomit
? in that yellow thing, low to the earth like a caterpillar
Glass house so you see me nigga
2 door coupe thats a lady killa
I just campaignin' with my wrist on chill
Champagne bottles yeah we got em on chill
Shawty don't care who her boyfriend is
Don't fuck her right, then another nigga will
Pocket full of them dead guys and they all tryna crawl out
White got them speed bumps, you know I'm bout to ball out
We can tear the mall down
Pocket got the mumps now
We shut the club down
Know I got my top down

[Verse 2: Future]
These rappers all on my head
They rather cut off my legs
Because I run the city from to Tokyo to the feds
I done lost my damn mind
I bout to cut off my dreads
Got big head Benjamin's I'm walking with a limp then (?) (RACKS)
Yeaahhh
Now turn it up a notch
I'm flyer then a helicopter
Don't speak to or talk to cops
And you know I hate them rappers (why?)
They can't wait to catch you slippin' for your style and kidnap ya
I cover my body in gold
I speak this shit from my soul
All I can think about them days
I was standin' out in the cold (trappin)
Whether you my friend or foe
Better believe I'm trained to go (TTG!)
I disguise my pain, by orderin' up ones and lettin' em go
FUTURE!

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I called my baby momma told her quit her job
Lil Tunechi your favorite rapper tell him get a job
It's a new nigga all I wear is tru nigga
It's lonely at the top but I got a great view nigga
You know how I do nigga
Louis on my shoe nigga
Walk around the club
Ha-chu nigga
College park soilder killed em with the cold aura
All these chains on, I give your hoe the cold shoulder
All my verses sick, with no cold sores
All these snakes around me I got lawnmowers
Plus I chop your hoe down nigga Tom Sawyer
And my watch the same size as a camcorder
Damn!
