Im Higher Than A Parachute
And A Pair Of Eagles
I Might Paralyze Ya Ima Needa Paralegal
And I ain't fantasizing when I mingle with the women
I'll take you and her now I got a pair of singles
Then I cut em up
Like a pair of scissors
Hit em wit dat batman and hang from the ceiling
Suicide doors, hang from the Bentley
Nobody had to die but I made me a killin
Big Wheel Whippin
Bitch Still Chillin
What more can I say
Im Dealin
Get Dough Wit Dilllan
Bitch Dont Act Right
Im Puttin Her Out Of The Crib
