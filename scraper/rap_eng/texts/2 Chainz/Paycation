[Intro]
'Chea, (South Side)
Duffle Bag Boys, (Playaz Circle)
Dealer, Deuce

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I’m still getting money on vacation
So we call that shit a "Paycation"
Getting money, keep it coming
And I’m getting head with the engine running
Keep it coming, keep it coming
And I’m getting head with the engine running
Keep it coming, keep it coming
And I’m getting head with the engine running

[Verse 1: Dolla Boy]
My diamonds be dancing, my bitches bout action
Looking like an actress might be Ken to the ?
I try to tell you niggas all I needed was a plug
A couple tracks a couple scratchs let’s turn the city up (Turn it up)
On parole, tryna get them Paso another 9 gone
Get it with my eyes closed
A chief in milestone, as them stacks pile on
Jack boys on the prowl come and get your mind blown
Engine snatching, riding with that ratchet
Big black judge on the seat, no hatchet
Bitches on the block don’t try to ask 'em "What’s happening ?"
Get them to the room, bend them over, what’s cracking ?
Choppers in the doorway, just got off a 4 way
Let her count the check before she suck it, foreplay
Where I’ve been lately ? I’ve been on the phone with Whose
Strong in the game motherfucker but I don't play

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dolla Boy]
Shout out to them niggas who be dropping off and picking up
In the kitchen water whipping man you tell so he's a foe
Shawty had to call me, he was having problems getting it
Dope boy conversation, tell me what the ticket is
I’m a boss so fuck what it cost
I’m strapped up and I’m trapping, in my C-White Royce
I’m riding 'round and I’m getting it too like deuce in the Porsche
It’s my vacation flow on the cruise to Saint Roy
Coop’s in our weather, ? with the lover
Shawty got a boyfriend, but I can fuck her better
Head on the highway, pedal to the metal
She ask me when I’m coming back, I'mma tell her never
I’m the shit, bitch I’m the shit
I never seen a bitch that I couldn’t hit
Never seen a brick that I couldn’t whip
Catch me on the stove, 7/15 niggas still fucking with the blow, cold

[Hook]
