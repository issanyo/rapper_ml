10 grand and cologne on my dresser
I’m a natural born finesser (x3)
My pimp hand, got these hoes breaking cheddar
I’m a natural born finesser (x3)

Ain’t nobody fresher, even on a stretcher
Trying to test us
Niggas screaming T.R.U story, like masseuse applying pressure
If that’s you’re girl arrest her
Ho get out of line, I correct it
Know this she was spears, surrounded by squares like a checker
Migo got that work, white as every decker
Shouts to Hector
You know Mega schooled me
Bitch be making movies, lots of extras
Paid a fortune for the lean
Plus I’m clean, pimping in my jeans
Might kidnap your queen, bend her over, make her scream
She probably seen …

[Verse 2 — Short Dawg]
Money long as Lexus, boy that weed you smoking, on a spaceship
Puffing on that trash, you don’t blow no gas, like a Tesla
Imma stack this cake, all that acting fake, is for the wrestlers
Party in my place, grab your bag and skate, Imma text ya
Told her : “Imma show my naked no affection"
Put her on a poles, no election, don’t collect it
Give me all my ho, give me all my cheese
What you mean, Pimping in my jeans
The chick of your dreams, I just kicked her out
And she had must have seen…

[Verse 3 — 2 Chainz]
I bet you didn’t know for every different ho
I got a different flow
PRPF them foes, sadity ho, ricardo teechi clothes
See I might free the ho [Yeeaaahh]
Get that Jeezy flow [Ha Haaa]
Pimp hand got a ho under pressure
I’m a natural born caresser
I might fuck her on the strecther
I might make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
And they sayin' Money tall, with this selection
I’m kicking it like Messi
It’s like saying, you can’t do nothing right to a lefty
Bond on my Nina, got them standing right next to us
Spraying it with both hands bitch I’m ambidextrous
