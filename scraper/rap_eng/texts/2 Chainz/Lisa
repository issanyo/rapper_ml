[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Met her last night, fucked her last night
Woke up this morning, fucked her this morning
Two girls on me, loose ones only
New ones only, two guns on me
No bedroom, futon only
Ass so big i drove a Yukon on it
Tity two chains, two gold Rollies
Thats his and hers, we’re flicking birds
Fuck ‘em

[Hook: Naadei]
All my white girls, all my white girlfriends
With your credit cards, your big-ass house girlfriends
Got 2 Chainz on I knew you’d like that
I got HK on i knew you’d like that

[Verse 2: Naadei]
I met this girl she was called Lisa
White girl dressed like a drug dealer
Lisa told me tell all y’all niggas
Dont nobody fuckin’ with you in the ‘burb
Hand on the wheel and her wheel on the curb
Lisa’s like ‘fuck what you say’
Gold in her mouth when no one’s in the house she be talking like she’s from the A

[Hook: Naadei]
All my white girls, all my white girlfriends
With your credit cards, your big-ass house girlfriends
Got 2 Chainz on i knew you’d like that
I got HK on i knew you’d like that

[Verse 3: Naadei]
I was trying to get my Soundcloud poppin’
Put this online and get two or three listens
Get on the bus and get right back to class
Move to Miami and work on my English
All the white girls be at Apt200
They calling up Zach from the door ‘cause the all trying to get in
You dont do gin dont do Jack dont do vodka
Prescription pills from your mom in that water
You get the bill man it dont even matter

[Hook: Naadei]
All my white girls, all my white girlfriends
With your credit cards, your big-ass house girlfriends
Got 2 Chainz on i knew you’d like that
I got HK on I knew you’d like that
I know you like that
