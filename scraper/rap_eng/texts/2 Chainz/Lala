[Verse 1 - 2 Chainz]
Ok this how I'm feelin
Red bitch with me, dark skin friend callin talkin bout come get me
F650 diesel fuel, I'm hungry, I'm so fly I eat eagle food
Warning I use weapons for my business too
Put the 40 to the dome of ya business suit (blaow!)
My bank roll on steroids and I'm on alloys and altoids
Smoking indo outdoors

[Hook - 2 Chainz]
La la la la la la la la la la
That's what I'm blowin on
La la la la la la la la la la
Cause all I blow is strong
La la la la la la la la la la
That's what I'm blowin on
La la la la la la la la la la
Cause all we blow is strong

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz]
Them niggas talking blah blah
And I'm smoking la la
Drop the top and show them tatas in the middle of the popeyes
First I eat a biscuit, then I hit my car lock
Pulled out the parking lot just like it was a car lot
Codeine diet, she on a protein diet
So high when I went to sleep I woke up tired
Two girls in the bed so I woke up smiling
And I keep killin shit I need anti violence
And I dress myself I'm so anti stylist
The shit I'm smokin on is so anti silent
Money piling up when I count I gotta climb it
Make it rain change the climate, take my ring and change the diamond

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Busta Rhymes]
Long spliff that I be holdin between my fingers and I be holdin between my diamond rings
Higher than a muthafucka then I get to spittin and a spazzin and a shittin and a smashin err'thing
Nigga you don't see the way I run the city boy?
Smokin til a nigga look a lil shitty boy
Whoop the shit up outta nigga little pretty boy
Real G's up in the buildin me and Tity Boi
Why you nigga's never get it every single time I say the radio be tryna to edit everything I say
Cause I talk about the way I smoke a lot of weed and give the street the shit a nigga need to deal with everyday
You can never stop what I'm gonna do when I'm comin through you ain't gotta clue better know that
Then I put it down smoke another pound buy another round give me an L of dro let me blow that

[Hook]
