Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Mind right, money right
Red flag, red hat
I’m alright fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right I do it for the money
And if I don’t do nothing I’mma ball
I said if I don’t do nothing I’mma fuck you up
If you fuckin’ with me, who fuckin’ with me?
Fuck with me!!!
And where will I be, without my E
Yeah without my street, and that’s Apple & Eagle bitch

I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry

[Verse 2 - Tity Boi]
Woke up this morning, feeling all horny
Picked up my pistol, fucked my opponent
The roof on dismissal, the feet are enormous
They on the same shit we switched up the toilets
I looked in the mirror and I said what’s happening?
The mirror said “you are, you conceited bastard!"
Well that’s true, the Coupe look like it came with the wheels
Because it got a paper tags still
And the passengers a pill away from being DOA
Down on her ass freak for the chips, Frito lay
And the waiter shorty move throw it thisa way
When the players hit the club nigga leave some way
Cause we as real as they soldiers in the field
Cause we fighting for something but we don’t know what it is
I’m trying to get higher than last months bills
Cause this months here, this one's clear
This one's brown, this one's beer
Man we got it lookin' like a bar in the VIP
The flow is contagious and deadly like Rabies
Had your girl in the suite swallowin' babies
But that is irrelevant it was all a pre-requisite
Nigga I’m ill, nigga I need medicine
Like Excedrin cause it’s this big
Broke my dishwasher and bought a new crib

Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
Staring at the mirror looking down into its eyes
I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Don’t worry, don’t worry
No worries, no worries
Cause I’m as real as they come
