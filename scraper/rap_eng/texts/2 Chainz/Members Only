[2 Chainz]

Walk out the house & forget my strap
All this codeine made me take a nap
These are Buscemi’s with gator straps
I got a pool with a lake to match
Head butt the truth and I face the facts
Im getting high off my own batch
Told lil’ mama lets face time
But Im not talkin’ ‘bout phone sex
I am so criminal minded
You might just have to rewind it
Girl and some pills, a crib in the hills
And we gonna have a good time, yeah
Surround myself with the dividends
Me and Sha, we were pitching in
And I got me some white from my caus'O
Makein' him snort it like Erkel
Gotta the trap jumpin on hurdles
You bout to witness a murder
Take me a track and I lay it down
Kill it and go to the funeral
I know some niggas that Jug
Just to pay bills
I know some niggas that Jug
Just to make Mill's
