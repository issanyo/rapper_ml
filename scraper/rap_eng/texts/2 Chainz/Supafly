[Verse 1]
Beige walls wood grain floors
All white cars full of red ass whores, charge
I'm bout to take the trash out
MC's is wet couldn't last the last drought
Walk in the spot bitches ass out
No tity boy fuck 'em till they pass out
Then cash out, hair weave killer
Do you know how many tracks I done snatched out ?
Whoa kimosabe she look like turagi make me say oh lord like it was Sunday
Our house for rent with no credit check in my mind I'm thinking we done found another trap !  Put the burglar bars up, with the night vision, I got the MBA swag for the white bitches, ugh ! white furs nigga his and hers ..had to leave the hawks game and go sell a bird, That's that money shit and I expect a turn word to  the motherfuckas that be selling surp !
I'm bout to slow this bitch down and park it on the curb
And take the girl that im with and fuck her on a purse, yeah
And that she got the money back
If she don't do what I like I want my money back
Insomniac raps she can't sleep on i take her out dinner
So I can get my eat on, we on doing this in street
Going down hills Like I got fucking skis on, icy, free on
Flying and shit know niggas like a P John

[Hook]
Supa fly
He so supa dupa supa fly
He so fly, fly
He so supa dupa supa fly
You nasty nasty nasty boy
You nasty nasty nasty boy
Give it, give it to me
Give it to em, to me
Oh you nasty boy
You nasty nasty boy
You nasty nasty boy
Give it, give it to me
Give it, give it to me, to me


[Verse 2]
They wanna know what it feel like
Cause they know all my raps is real life
Nasty nigga..might eat her twice
Met her once I was just being polite
So the hospitality is the dog in me
It's a dog eat dog world you might need a leash
Roof ! same spot nigga different day
When you was doing backflips I was flipping Ye
I'm fresher than you've ever been, 2 of everything momma should have had a twin
Ugh! promethazine that's my medicine
2 girls at the door nigga let em in
Let em win this is strip poka
Messing up the dry wall hit em on the sofa
How you gonna win em all with ya fist open
And you already know what we smoking
Bust shots then reload, im taking off from the motherfuckin' free throw

[Hook]

You know I'm not like the rest of them baby, i love you
You do something for me baby

You know like a ..say you go to the store for me or something small like that
Go get me something to eat, or just be there for me
I love you baby, im saying you just down for my move you feel me > you down for what im down for, i ain't like these other niggas fronting i feel like life to short, I respect you, you respect em
