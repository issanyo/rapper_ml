[Hook: Jae Millz x2]
Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly keep me smiley
Molly make me walk up in that club and act holly
Screaming fuck everybody
Waitress please ciroc me, I don’t need no [?]
She escort me to the party, that’s right

[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
I’m up in the cloud, yeah I’m on one
I’m on a strong one, party pack in my pocket, who wants some?
Spending hard as a bitch, motherfuck the club up with my condom
Vip my whole hood there, rolling hard, good year
Hoes from my old hood think I’m in Hollywood
Normally, I would care, but tonight hoe, you might be right though
Fucking with my waldo, get the fuck about my ear though
I’m tryna to jump on anybody’s [?] daughter
Puddles in the sheets, she leaking through the covers
Tomorrow I might hate this bitch, but tonight I’ma fuck her like I love her
Cold like the shot, I’ma smoke till I die
Put the night when I’m on out prolly, slap your ass for saying hi
Brain fry, it’s an understatement to say I’m high
I’m partying where the telescope, looking down the sky, thanks to

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
My true religion called koala, pop my car like fonzi
Fuck your girl for a hunned, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Still serving them narcotics, have you missing like [?] Thomas
I got a rubber on while I’m fucking
I got a rubber band round my money
Go the shades on cause I’m geeked up
Been away for a week plus
You pussy for a teeth brush
Hair down to my make up, 3 blunts, that’s a …
Lame ass nigga, thought I’d trip it but I kill it
I do this shit for the hood, repping it for the streets
And she off my sheets, bend that pussy to seats
Yeah checking for leaks, I’m a roofing expert
And my weed so loud, they can hear it next door
