[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Juicy, squeeze it, then juicy
Sipping on the D'usse
Rocking some Medusa, give a fuck what you say
Give a fuck what you say
In the club, I wrote this for the plug
I wrote this for a hater that was looking for some love
A DJ competition, I'm mixing in the kitchen
Now who gon' do the dishes
Bankroll thicker than Deelishis

[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Drug connotation in my population
I want a conversation, don't want no confrontation
Pull up in a hardtop, watch how I race it
Trap to the wrap like watch how I embrace it
Louis Vans on, they don't come with laces
And we talking straight shots, we don't need no chaser
Tell her I don't chase her, swap her, I replace it
Bracelet, this is Rollie, Rollie, this is bracelet
Pass the medication
Rounds upon rounds, I am nowhere around
I'm nowhere to be found
I'm on flights over lights, I'm so close up to Christ
I might ask for advice, I might ask for it twice
Look at my ice, I'm so nice, it's like Mardi Gras
Mama I shot me a man, please go hide the gun
When she ask me my number, I say I'm the one
Rushing summer to summer until someone come

[Chorus: Pharrell WIlliams]
You, you, you, you, you
Hate me 'cause I tell you the truth
Maybe your friends are confused
I'm gonna tell you the truth
Go ahead and goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
Goooo, bailan, bailan, bailan, bailan
All week, keeping on, my mind is...
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe now, but not next time
Going in, going in, going in, going in
There we go, that' it for sure
Going in, going in, going in, going in
Maybe just a little more
Going in, going in, going in, going in

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Go ahead and touch the sky
Go ahead and touch the sky
Dancing where you are
Go ahead and touch the sky
