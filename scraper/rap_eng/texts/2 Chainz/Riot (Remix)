[Intro: 50 Cent]
I don’t even know what to say, ain’t got to say much
You hear my voice, you know it’s 50

[2 Chainz]
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it {*4X*}

I say lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
Lame niggas be quiet, you in the presence of a real nigga
I say lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
Lame niggas be quiet, you in the real nigga’s presence
I eat your girl up for breakfast, won’t save you no extras
Say she fuck with me cause a real nigga’s her preference
Drinking like I’m from Texas, and you know I stay flexin’
And if you don’t know I go by Tity two necklace

[50 Cent]
Nigga that cocaine that I’m flippin' (yeah), wood-wood grain when I’m dippin' (grrrr)
Codeine when I’m sippin’, bitch, you fucking right I be trippin’ (WOOOO)
I put your bitch face in my lap, .223s all in my strap
Count-count my paper, all of them stacks, fuck something up and get it right back
Nigga try me

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I’ma start a riot, I’ma start a riot {*4X*}

[2 Chainz]
I ain't stunnin’ these niggas, I ain't stunnin’ these bitches
2 cigarrellas, look-look like extensions (damn)
Yeah I’m from the south side, her mouth wide, my pack loud
My gat loud, I back out and click clack pow pow
Court dates, still trial, my rep is a reptile
Now later, alligators, I step on a work like a step child (whoo)
Pimps up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I’m down, her phone off so don’t dial

[50 Cent]
That-that pyrex in my kitchen, rich niggas still bitchin'
Them GDs and them vicelords or that gangsta shit I be kickin'
Who Blood now? Who Crippin?, who pussy? Tell me who snitchin'?
I got a firearm to fire on for whoever done let that bitch in (bitch in)
These niggas don’t live by the codes then cut in and fucked up the game
Throw your sets up if you don’t give a fuck, it’s 50 and 2 Chainz
Got the hood back poppin’, I dance to this, I buy the whole bar, nigga you can drank to this
Get the bottles poppin’ while the hoes watchin’ and damn I love this gangsta shit

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
(Yeah... that's what I'm talkin' 'bout)
We gone get back to the real shit
Quit fucking around
