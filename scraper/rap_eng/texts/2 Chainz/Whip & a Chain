I want a whip and a chain
I want a whip and a chain
I want a whip and a chain
Why they done switched up the game?
I want a whip and a chain
Hustled for whips and a chain
I want a whip and a chain
Yeah we don't see it the same
This is a new generation
We ain't scared of shit
We ain't beg for shit
There's niggas dead for this
I want a whip and a chain
Hustled for whips and a chain
I want a whip and a chain
Yeah we don't see it the same

[Verse 1]
Hustle in Rollie, you know it's time for that
Broken taillight, you can die for that
Ain't no LOL, ain't no hidin' that
Might put the whip and park that
Might walk around in camoflauge, strapped
Bitch poppin' like bra straps
Only Kappa steps with a signed petition
Told the governor to revise the system
My auntie, she reside in prison
Damn near did thirty flat
Nigga round here playin' with kids
Get out and go to Baby Gap
Can't respect it, won't respect it
Got ejected, check the checklist
Don't expect to get on the guest list
Got a necklace on a necklace

I want a whip and a chain
I want a whip and a chain

Why they done switched up the game?
I want a whip and a chain
Hustled for whips and a chain
I want a whip and a chain
Yeah we don't see it the same
This is a new generation
We ain't scared of shit
We ain't beg for shit
There's niggas dead for this
I want a whip and a chain
Hustled for whips and a chain
I want a whip and a chain
Yeah we don't see it the same

[Verse 2]
1831 Exodus, prejudice, represent
Heaven-sent, Hell-bound
Jail-bound, necklace, hecklers, death wish
Yeah, preachin' today and kill you tonight
Nobody care how I'm feelin' tonight
This how I move in the middle of the night
Got all my people to get up and fight
Guess I'ma be the new villain tonight
Liftin' the spirits to Biblical heights
I talk to Christ so I'm feelin' him right
Nat with the Turner, that don't concern you
Stick it inside you, then I'ma turn you
Then I'ma learn you, then I'ma burn you
I got it on me like it's a thermal
