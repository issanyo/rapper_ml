[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Sitting back, getting my dick sucked by the neighborhood ho
East side local 304, stay twisted off that reefer smoke
Stay twisted off them potent pills, might just taste the powder back
Candy nose, man I ran these hoes in a white Range Rove', 'bout to pound her back
No strings attached, bitch might be a ho but she my homie though
She got that friendly pussy, when I touch down she let my homies scope
Preacher's daughter, choir every Sunday bitch you known to blow
When I was on the block broke back in '04, bitch act like she ain’t know me though
But it's all to the good, baby I forgive ya, hoes caught up in the hype
See the chrome shine bright, and now they think I'm they type of nigga
Bitch pump your brakes, you wanna make the bed shake, get dressed and I might come get ya
This ain't a date and never hesitate, you can put your lips where you like while I light my swisha
"Fred you so cold on a ho," I know but I just sit back and get chose
All about my stacks fuck a rat bitch I’m gon' stay on ten toes
Got doctors, models, college freaks, and broads on strip poles
When I'm tipping in the G, gotta smoke one with my neighborhood ho

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs] x2
Man, sometimes I like to kick it with them neighborhood hoes
Get drunk and puff a swisha with them neighborhood hoes
My bitch say I stay fucking with them neighborhood hoes
I swear, man it ain't nothing like them neighborhood hoes

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I'm riding around and I'm getting it
You riding around and you didn't
I am riding around with semis, life's a bitch so I pimp it
Bread long like Pippen, Gucci on, not Dickies
I will dick her down so quickly
I draw pistols with no pencils
You know what I'm here for, that's to get dough
Hotter than six niggas in a Pinto with the vents closed
Period, menstrual, sentimental bimbos
Telling me they love me but been with all my kinfolks
Want a slice like Kimbo, ice like igloo
I like a girl that like doing what her friend do
'Specially if it's me and I'm laying in the middle
And all my verses cold, my microphone should wear a trenchcoat
Trapping at the Citgo, yea the Citgo
Now I'm the shit, I remember when I was piss poor
Neighborhood hoes still hanging in the neighborhood
And I don't have to talk too much cause my paper do it

[Hook] x2
