[Verse]
Me and my niggas 'bout to fuck the city up
I dropped twenty bands early just to get the Bentley truck
We walked in the Blue Flame, there was like ten of us
They were calling my name, they were like, "Tity Boi"
We were trying to lay low like we had some tint on us
And me and Cap 1 looked like we got ten on us
We don't have to rent no bus, we don't have to rent no tux
I know things was slowing down, but now things are picking up
You ain't whip a brick enough, your old girl ain't thick enough
And if you ain't got a mill in cash, you ain't rich enough
All these niggas switching up, all these niggas bitching up
Even if they was drowning, they know not to reach at us
Trying to make a speaker bust, riding in a diesel truck
Teachers tried to preach at us, but they wasn't deep enough
Only thing you had for dinner was a blunt and Pizza Hut
Only thing you had for dessert was a fucking Reese's cup
See, I'm the Dean of The Real U
My girl working at the spot said she don't feel you
I wanna fuck her and I want her, too
I need pussy rehab, nigga, what about you?
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
This is part two and I can't go no further
Until Gucci come home and put a verse up on this motherfucker
I'm out
