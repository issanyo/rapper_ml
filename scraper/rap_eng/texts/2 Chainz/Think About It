[Intro]
Yeah... okay... 2 Chaaaaaaiiiiiinnnzzzz

[Verse 1]
Crap game at the Blue Flame, gamble up my loose change
2 Chainz, 'nuff said, throw money at her fo'head
Think about it, wait a minute think about it
Her pussy so wet it look like she wasted some drink around it
Best in Atlanta you really don't have to think about it
A nigga so cold my microphone got a mink around it
Tity 2 Chainz and the 2 means I'm double illa
2 hands on my balls nigga call it double dribble, uhhh

[Hook]
Think about it... now think about it
Think about it... jus think about it
Think about it... think about it
Now think about it... jus think about it

[Verse 2]
Think about the half, y'all don't know the half
Used to sell them bags, now I'm selling swag
Tell ya bitch to come here, tell ya bitch to come here
I'm only in town for a night, you can have her back when I dip
Smoke half a bag and I'm ripped, take another pull and I sip
I'm with my crew we high look like we walking around on stilts
Walking around on blimps, and we pushing weight
Got my pockets looking built, I draw gas the illest straight yeahh
Picture that. Take a picture. Pick a date
I come to ya city real soon and watch them titties shake
Anyway, I owe my girl one we did the 68
I'm real good at math so I know that don't mean penetrate
I'm coming off the top of my dome 'cuz my pen escaped
Nigga know this if you do not know anything
2 Chainz stay down like tennis shoes
I need a mil, wanna go to dinner soon

[Hook repeated]
