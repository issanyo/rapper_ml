[Intro]
Yah! Tru

[Hook]
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
If I know you, I'ma bless you
You my folks, I'ma bless you
If I love you, I'ma bless you
If I trust you, it's a blessing
If you flexin', then it's a blessing
And if they test you, then it's a blessing

[Verse 1]
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes it look like the mall
In the back of my mind, I ball harder than y'all
I used to have an old school that I sat on some dubs
For the first time in my life, mama knew I sold drugs
There it was, hustlin' across the way
Went in on my first ounce with Big Shay
AG had orange, DC had white
Lil cuz got murked, you ain't seen that life
I done bought at least two chains more than twice
Count money from the night 'til the mornin' light
Had a convo with God, I told him, "Thank you, Lord
Cause everything that I've got, I'd like to thank you for"

[Hook]
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
If I know you, I'ma bless you
You my folks, I'ma bless you
If I love you, I'ma bless you
If I trust you, it's a blessing
If you flexin', it's a blessing
And if they test you, it's a blessing

[Verse 2]
My partner bought so much pussy, man they gave that boy a discount
Hold up, wait a minute, ho I think I got a miscount
I've been runnin' through them rubber bands all day, ho
I've been runnin' through them rubber bands, I got pesos
I just dropped the top on the whip, I'm in fuego
I just poured a 4 in a mothafuckin' Faygo
Diamonds on my teeth, lick the clit, now it's shinin'
Ate a caesar salad, I dropped carats in my salad
Pinky ring, water wrist, water neck, frigid, yeah
Glasses vintage, car vintage, I'm about to get it, yeah
Pocket full of money, nothin' less than a 50, yeah
Smokin' on a zip, nothin' less than a hippy, yeah


[Hook]
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
If I know you, I'ma bless you
You my folks, I'ma bless you
If I love you, I'ma bless you
If I trust you, it's a blessing
If you flexin', it's a blessing
And if they test you, it's a blessing, yeah

I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
If I know you, I'ma bless you
You my folks, I'ma bless you, yah, tru!
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
