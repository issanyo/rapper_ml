[Hook: The Weeknd & 2 Chainz]
Cause girl I'm just a bird
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
Cause girl I'm just a bird
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
Cause girl I'm just a bird
Girl I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me (yah, uh, 2 Chainz!)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz & The Weeknd]
They ain’t never seen a nigga like me (uh)
She ain't never seen a nigga like me (uh)
Chance of that is unlikely, 2 Chainz on my white T
I wipe her down and I pipe her down
I give my girl money to go out of town
You give your girl money to go to Niketown
And I one-night her, you must like her
Kill niggas with one-liners, all I need is one lighter
Counting so much money (so much money) I got arthritis
So cold I frostbite 'em, no Pig Latin but I hog-tied 'em
If she gets this dizick then I (make her fall in love)
With a nigga like me I’m killing this beat
Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet on my sheets
On top or from the back, I thundercat like (ho!)
My girl got a big purse with a purse in it
And her pussy so clean, I can go to church in it!
Oh Lord, O-M-G, I am the O-N-E
How ya like me now? It’s cool but she want mo' D
Moet by the fireplace, this is how desire taste
And I’m bout to buy a case (le'go)

[Hook: The Weeknd & 2 Chainz]
Cause girl I'm just a bird
Don't make me make you fall in love (yeah)
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me (uh)
Like me (I mean that ain't just doing it like that, baby)
Cause girl I'm just a bird
I'm just another bird (T.R.U.)
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me (uh)
Like me (yeeeeeah!)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz & The Weeknd]
Bon apetite, they obsolete
You know talk is cheap so don't say a word
Cheep, cheep, chicken talk, I’m flipping birds, fuck y'all
Mustard, ketchup, I take pills, expert
Kitchen all pyrexed up, if my dick talked, it would say "Next up!"
Me and yo girl networked, now she wanna know my net worth
Wood grain, chestnut, titty fuck, chest nut!
Move shit, UPS truck, pull a lil' out n out the rest up
Competition need to rest up (make her fall in love)
I aim at ya head, put the vest up, matter fact put the vest up!
This shit I’m shootin is penetrating, you don’t want this situation
Tall nigga with a short temper
I do this for niggas who never had shit
And now I got me a bad bitch
That got a bad bitch that got a bad bitch
"T.R.U. Story", high like, two stories
2 Chainz and Tity Boi, nigga, that’s two stories, who want it?
Hair Weave Killer, they like "you want it"
I go swimming in that pussy, 'bout to throw a pool party

Cause girl I'm just a bird
