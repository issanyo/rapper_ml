[Hook: Rico Richie]
Trap goin' ape
Racks goin' ape
Wrists goin' ape
Bricks goin' ape
Drugs goin' ape
Drugs goin' ape
Club goin' ape
Club goin' ape
When you gettin' to that money, niggas gon' hate
Man fuck what the haters think
I'm blowing money like I robbed a bank
I'm blowing money like I robbed a bank

[Verse 1: Rico Richie]
My dogs just whipped a chicken with a egg beater
33 for a senorita, neck and wrist icy like a margarita
In California smokin' on some [?]
We on another level that you can't reach it
All my niggas ballin', boy you sittin' in the [?]
Your bitch just gave me neck and then she bought my single
We sellin' drugs and blowin' gas like it's legal
I just beat that pussy up like I like you, Tina
A 20 for a show, a milli for a feature
My pockets are so chubby just like Queen Latifah
You think you get it lower, but we get it cheaper

[Hook: Rico Richie]

When you gettin' to that money, niggas gon' hate
Man fuck what the haters think
I'm blowing money like I robbed a bank
I'm blowing money like I robbed a bank

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
(Yeah... 2 Chainz!!)
Bathin' apes on top of bathin' apes
Drug money in collection plates
Lord forgive me I'm a hustler baby
All these chains 'bout to suffocate me
Rubber band Mr Fantastic
Used to sleep on an air mattress
If you bought a car before you bought a crib
I'mma tell you that's ass backwards
Main bitch, water
This ape shit, water
Daughter earrings, water
All my 16's, boring
Lennox fifths, Benny's shrimp
Lobster rasta, Rosa Acosta
Blowing money fast, free Big Meech
Ran 12 of 'em, call it pig feet

[Hook: Rico Richie]
Trap goin' ape

Man fuck what the haters think
I'm blowing money like I robbed a bank
I'm blowing money like I robbed a bank

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
Your bitch, we goin' ape
Put your Benz on the double tape
Feel super [?]
That was the plan with this southside shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
We on some P shit, you know?
You know I go
We come in peace
We leave your punk ass in the peace
Tru
