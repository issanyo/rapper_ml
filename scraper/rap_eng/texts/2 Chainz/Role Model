[Intro: DJ Teknikz & 2 Chainz]
See, we stacked down ’til we came up
And the same niggas we used to look up to
Now break bread with a nigga
Haha, Teknikz the muhfuckin’ DJ! Talk to em, Tit!
‘Member in school?
Teacher asked me what I want to be when I grow up, you know
You know, what I look up to
I told her I wanted to be the muhfuckin’ dopeman, you feel me?

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
Buy everybody in this bitch they own bottles
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model (yeah!)
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model (okay!)
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model (2 Chainz!)
Not Tyson, not Jordan, not Charles Barkley

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
As a young nigga, seen ‘em getting to the money
Told my mama, “One day I’ma be one of ‘em”
So many court dates, I’m damn near gone Sundays
Back in the day when ya safe was ya undies
And I can’t complain, I’m tryna take a plane to Onyx
Yeah I’m fly wit ya woman, I get high wit ya woman
They really can’t rap so these niggas started humming
As soon as they did, 12 start coming
You hear them drums? Give the drummer some
Nah (nah) for real, you need to give Drumma some
I looked up to the hustlas in the foreign cars
Who got that strong, Superman, that dun-ta-dun

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
Buy everybody in this bitch they own bottles
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model (yeah!)
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model (yeah!)
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model (2 Chainz!)
Not Tyson, not Jordan, not Charles Barkley (okay)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I’m problematic, problem with the automatic
Close-knit shit, cut from a different fabric
Very necessary, d-boys are legendary
My Pops hustled, so do I, it’s hereditary
These niggas acting like girls, Tyler Perry stuff
Wanna get with me, I tell ‘em, “Neveruary 31st”
Under drugs, it was upstairs, say all I talk about
Is Gucci shoes, but I got more than one pair
One scale, two bales, and a cell phone
Give me two weeks, I turn this shit into the Velvet Room
Velvet rope, red carpet, inhaling smoke
Imagine getting awards just for selling dope

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
Buy everybody in this bitch they own bottles
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
Not Tyson, not Jordan, not Charles Barkley

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
Sip lean up, we drink out the gold bottles
New Vogues on Lacs like the old models
Wet paint, big feet, make it more hard
Came out the hood from a broken family
The streets was my teacher, they showed me no amnesty
Courts start attacking me, on top of that they adding fees
Stack cheese to stay up, but more important is lawyer fees
Coach said I was a point guard
But I’m posted up on the block and I go hard
Skills of a big man, nah, I’m a dope boy
Big bomb in the bushes, pistol in my ho car

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
Buy everybody in this bitch they own bottles
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
The dopeman my muhfuckin’ role model
Not Tyson, not Jordan, not Charles Barkley
