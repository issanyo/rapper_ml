[Intro]
If Puerto Rico wasn't gone he would be right here with me
If True wasn't gone he would be right here with me
Rest in peace to my niggas from my block
And free all my niggas tryna get some guap
I'm screamin' "Free [?]" till he come home

[Chorus]
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
We some street niggas, we got next, bitch
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch

[Verse 1]
Yeah, understand, yeah, bust it down
I wanna see you dance bitch, bust it down
I ain't playin', hundred grand bitch, bust it down
I'm on a beast too
Gucci my feet too
Fuck around and buy a mink
I got Cuban on my links
I might pull up in a Brinks
On some rims and some tings
Give a fuck what you tings, think, 'bout
I'm in a big clean car
Dope in the sixteen bars
Recited by yours truly
Fuck that bitch playin' Gucci
That's ratchet as fuck
I told her "back it on up"
My jacket matching the truck
I got back in the [?]

[Chorus]
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch
Bought a necklace just to flex, bitch
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, partner got a Android
Dippin', dappin', payin' for it
Extra year in the can for it
Concrete damn floor
Dancin' with the devil
Tryna leave the ghetto
Going state or federal
I Golden State the schedule
Gold rose petals
Out of the alphabet
G is my favorite letter
I gotta make it better
Cover the incidentals
[?] a killer, as long as the Lincoln Continental
The lawyers will be here any minute
Used to have commas, now I'm sentenced
Wrist in the bowl bought a Bentley
It got a hole in the ceiling
Partner in the hole for a metro, I think it's silly
Shawty sucked mine so damn long, I got a hickey
She know she prettier than Ricky
She step in blood when she walk
You know them rich niggas in prison
Try to FaceTime ya and talk
This is the greatest of all
Don't want no haters involved
Hold up, I'm taking this call
(Need that chain when I get out, player)

[Chorus]
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch
My nigga locked up with a smartphone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
That's some street shit, we got next, bitch
I bought a necklace just to flex, bitch

[Outro]
I'm good, I'm killin' niggas, you know that
That motherfucker [?] ain't he, what the hell y'all doin'
(Mumbled talking)
Can ya hear me boy?
(Mumbled talking)
Call me when you get some service so I can holla at you bruh
Okay cool man, like later on tonight I'ma have good service (Mumbling) Can you hear me?
Yeah, I'll be- I'll be up that's my time to move. Call me 'round that time
Okay cool, I'll hit you 'round that time then
Alright boy
