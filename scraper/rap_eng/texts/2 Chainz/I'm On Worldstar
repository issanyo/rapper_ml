[Verse 1 : Drumma Boy]
I'm on Worldstar, plus a worldstar
You might have seen me once before, in ya girl car
I'm on Worldstar, plus I'm Worldstar
You might have seen me once before, in ya girl car
Drumma Boy the name, but I go by D-Boy
Fresh nigga never known to miss a beat boy
All this product in the street
I'm Lieutenant to these tenants, stylin after me
Make these niggas learn the business, charge 'em all a fee
Make these lemons earn a kitchen, ain't no cookin free BOY
I got dope for my street niggas, crack for my ese's, Drum Squad le Cr√®me nigga
I'm a been-official Worldstar, in this game a decade, bitch I'm goin in nigga

[Verse 2 : 2 Chainz]
I'm on Worldstar, flexin in the latest Louis
Check my email all I seen was booty
When she call my phone I'm like ok cooley
I roll my blunts long nigga like a dooley
Tity 2 Chains but I'm wearin two braclets
Braclets so big look like two braces
Cartier dangIling, gold mutha fucka

Fucked her all night so in the morning fed her supper

And if you fuck with 2 Chains put ya 2's up

[Verse 3 : Gucci Mane]
It's Mr. Worldstar, and I just made the World news
Got your girlfriend comin out them new True's
And my life is like a blue print for a video

Throw a slumber party 100 bad bitches, me, Tity boy and Drumma Boy
Comas just keep on commin to me, they should call me coma boy
Lights, camera, action main attraction, It's Gucci mane in the caption
I'm trafficing that internet trappin, hate haters with a passion
I ordered 50 bottles at the World bar
I'll take that shit and put that shit on Worldstar
Got a AR15 and it sound off
I'll blow yo ass off and put that shit on Worldstar

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
I'm where the sales are (where?) I'm on Worldstar
Fucked ya bitch and left the rubbers in ya girl car
Bunch of king pins, that still sell raw
So it's some camera shots we might have to edit off
I'm all white, you just a block of Beige
And you can't miss me ho, I'm on top of the page
Ten million views, twenty million played
I made mo money than my whole career in seven days
Let's get rich together, then go our separate ways
My young niggas ride wit K's in they Chevrolet's
Work jumping back, I'm on that gang shit
Been in the trap so I ain't bought another chain yet
