[Intro: Ke$ha]
I am in love, with what we are, not what we should be, and
I am in love, with what we are, not what we should be, and
I am in love, with what we are, not what we should be, and

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I love your ass, naw for real I love your ass
You done got a little thick but I like to hug your ass
Yea your momma don't like me don't give a damn
What I do remain like a ceiling fan
I'm cool and I like to spend on ya
When you with me you don't really need employment
When you with me you really need another
When you with me you don't really need a rubber
We make love like chemist when we penetrating
When I first met you girl I was intimidated
You all sophisticated
And you educated and you know I like to run I'mma paper chaser
You a bad bitch girl you a bad bitch
And what we have now is more than the average
So before we get married I'mma tell you this
Your my wife before and after it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Start chest to chest then I make you touch your ankles
My hair knotty you act naughty and I might spank you
Star spangled banner yea I pledge allegiance
Two chains on and they are anomic
I like red pussy when that body brown
And yeah on that loud not that Bobby Brown
Put her face in the pillow she won't make a sound
Every time I take a shot I'm tryna make it count
And if she get sad I might buy a bag
And if she get mad I might buy a jag
Put a ring around it I can't wait to mink her down
Glad we had a little girl so it can trickle down
Woke up this morning I feel good as fuck
If your girl wit me you know she good as fuck
And I can't even lie that pussy good as fuck
First I pick her up then take her home and pick her up

[Hook]
