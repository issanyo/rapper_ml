Got a 35 in my roll paper
Spice One riding east bay gangster
Got fuck up niggas on the west side
Give a nigga to the west ride
Hit a nigga, YG 400
Told the homie Mustard keep it 100
Told Uncle Snoop roll up one
Gave me a badge, you can choke one

They ain't got the Bentley color piru
Nip first name, last name Hu$$le
Kendrick Lamar with lyrical muscle
Dr Dre had the best instrumentals

He had me walking around yelling "no bitch"
And showed me how this rapping make you hella rich, yeah

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride, let's go

If they ask about a nigga they ain't know

If they ask about a nigga they ain't know

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
