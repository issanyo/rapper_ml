[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Opening doors like an answer key, I make the life answer to me, no fantasy
An evil genius, I leave my mark of the beast on the beat
Actually, I'm all like a natural disaster, I make you a causality
Added up, mathematically, putting numbers up, like 23
And I'm Manning up like Peyton be, game is over, I should take a knee
And bow out gracefully, even if you look me in my eyes
See you wouldn't be facing me
So what the fuck is pain to me?
And what the hell is rain to me?
My life is very impressionable, like a Van Gogh painting be
Call me Vincent inside the dimension, that's my mantra
Listen there is no competition, the mission's conquered
Did I mention? These girls at my concert, addicted, no double entendre
Which is why I'm colder than a tundra on Christmas, put your hands up, can I get a witness?

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Why kill? the dark side's where I live
Horny devils in a red dress and high heels
You don't have an idea how many niggas done took my ideas
I take flight, I'm so bright, I don't even get no light bill
You road kill while I'm driving
I'm high-fiving, my dime riding, My time shining
From at the club and I'm outta town but I'm lying around it
Deuce chains I'm feng shui, everyday is my birthday
2 gats at the park, you don't wanna see these guns play
Patron and lemon lime, I got her back, all in her spine
I look my wife up in the eyes, and I think about  another dime
My atmosphere is ratchet here this right here is Bally gear and
I keep on killing shit
And I don't even have no tatted tear
You can put the motherfucker Caddie here
You can put the motherfucker Beemer there
Still got 2 more garage places, Louies on I unlaced it
Every verse I'm going crazy, every girl it's going crazy
2 guns, 2 chains, 2 rings, 2 bracelets
