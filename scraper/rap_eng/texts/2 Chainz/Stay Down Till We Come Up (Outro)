All eyes on me, this all ice on me
It ain’t about me having on a bunch of chains, a lot of ice
Or none of that, it’s about you
You niggas who got a bunch of chains and a lot of ice
You tryna see what’s going on over here ain’t you
Ain’t you? I know
Like I say man, technique, I won’t appreciate it man you know
You been working hard too dog, you know what I mean?
And people, they gon pay attention to that
And you know Imma stay down, keep doing what I’m doing
And eventually man, all the thoughts they gon connect, you dig?
Cause we gon stay down till we come up
