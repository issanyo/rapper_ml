[Hook x2]
I came in a porche
I came in to floss
I got a phone full of dimes
I don’t know which one to call oh
I just know I wanna floss
I don’t know if I should cheat
‘Cause I love my nina rose yeah

[Verse 1]
I got a thing for my nina
And some things we did between us
Dem niggas acting dirty
We gon’ take ‘em to the cleaners
In a beamer with Sabrina
A daddy got the refill baby
Daddy in the chain game
He got it out in december
It’s a cold world fast brakes, no words
Even when I rap I have to spit cold words
Making niggas see my view Whoopi Goldberg
How could I get caught over if I had a chauffeur,over
Treat the backseat like a couch
Treat these other niggers like trap roll em' in
Throw ‘em out realest here
Rep the south know the ends
And the out being like I got 3oh 3 at my house

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m in love with the bitch we clicking like a lighter
Take her everywhere I go because I’m not tryna fight you
Every touch a pop off you make a nigga like it shorty
Here’s a show off you don’t want to see the hive
But I can make the car squat I jam my niece with diapers
I’m shittin’ er’where like a dog with diarrhea
I scroll through my phone call my girl from Tanzania
And yeah I got the porsche she said I’m on ‘em and it’s me
You niggers park back like you play the sellafield
I’m hungry I got a taste for a different meal
I pulled up in that 4 door , oh no
Keep the 9 on me Tony Romo
Pass the remote I’m on I’m ’bout to turn it on
I saw you on something different than what I’m burning on
I was on the corner when I first perform
Wave my hands in the air and told all the cars
Come on

[Hook]
