[Intro]
Realest nigga in it, already know
Got trapper of the year 4 times in a row
Realest nigga in it, already know
Got trapper of the year 4 times in a row

[Chorus]
Rap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check
Trap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check

[Verse 1]
Rap shit check, trap shit check
Cashier check, fashion check
Foreign car check, foreign bitch check
Rolex check, gold around my neck
Juju on the diamond, my umbrella’s designer
Stand on your recliner, pourin’ all the wine up
Yea I used to pitch, you should see my wind up
Nigga fuck with me ain’t no telling where you wind up
It’s all love, positive vibes
Walking through the airport in crocodile slides
Wet floor signs, hands on thighs
If you got a check put your hands up high

[Chorus]
Rap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check
Trap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check

[Verse 2]
Come on, come on, come on
I rock the microphone, I had to thank the Lord
I am in rare form, I had to get it on
You never feed me, I use my own seasoning
Autograph cleavage, how many girls believe you?
How many girls you tried, I know a girl you lied to
She wants your ass to die, I look you dead in your eye
It’s real nigga season, it’s right after Easter
Might buy me a Regal, put that on my Visa
I need me some singles, don’t care if you’re single
Take you and mingle, take you to Neiman’s
We hit the bars tonight, look at the roof on the Wraith
It look like the stars at night, yeah

[Chorus]
Rap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check
Trap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check
Rap shit check, foreign shit check
Fashion shit check, cashing shit check
I ain’t talkin’ Nike when I’m talkin’ ‘bout a check
Bought your girl some Nikes when she asked me ‘bout a check

[Outro]
ASAP, ASAP, ASAP, ASAP…
