Yeah, Birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside the Louis store

They ask me what I do, and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call
When I die bury me inside the gucci store
When I die bury me inside the louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call

She got a big booty so I call her big booty
Skirt, skirt, wrists moving, cooking it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
She made a juice, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathing if I hold my breath
Referee with the whistle, hold his tech
Extendo, extendo roll
When your girl leave me, she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer, going on a trapathon
See I done have more bars than pakistan
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
She ... i'm boring you in will call
When I die bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die bury me inside the truey store
True to my religion, true everything i'm too different!
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches

They ask me what I do, and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call
When I die bury me inside the gucci store
When I die bury me inside the louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call

She holdin out, she ain't givin to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the tv on
Ya'll been together 10 years, you deserve a menage
Especially if you put that bmw in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her mama crib
Werent't you at niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, do better
She said, how bout I get you jewelry from the weston
How bout she hit the west inn and get her best friend
Im joking, im just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching don't be touching shit
We in kanye west's benz cuz I will turn you back to a pedestrian

They ask me what I do, and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call
All I want for my birthday is a big booty call

Bad bitches contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitches contest, you in first place

Then hand the valet the keys to the mercy
Tell the dj play your song, this shit come on
What i'm seeing from the back I can't front on
They ask me what I do, and who I do it for
When I die bury me inside the booty club
Get it good, get it good, get it get good
I might switch it up and get you good

They ask me what I do, and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
