Ugh!

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz & (Kid Ink)]
Mami, you remind me of something (uh)

You remind me of something (uh)
Baby, you remind me

Don't even know
'Cause you remind me of something
Girl, you gotta show me (uh)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, on the real know, west coast back like '94
Just picture me rollin' in my own lane
Should of listened to the hype though, hold that
And show me somethin', DJ ain't playin' nothin' but Mustard
Catch up to the bandwagon, fuck us
It's Friday, I'm feelin' like the old Chris Tucker (ugh!)
And we gold for the record
Tryna go platinum and add a couple karats
Bein' low key kinda hard with the cameras
Her boyfriend here, but she lookin' so careless

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz & (Kid Ink)]
Baby, you remind me
Baby, you remind me of something (uh)

But I don’t know what it is right now, yeah, yeah (I don't know)
'Cause you remind me of something
Girl, you gotta show me, yeah (uh)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Hold up, don't you know that this the remix?
And she just got her weave fixed
Niggas go and get your weed lit
Ayy, all my Cali niggas need it
Let's get to that booty, that you throwin' round, baby
I give that booty work, I'ma never go lazy
Dancing with your girl, in your own world
Face like an angel, is it wrong I can't wait to bang you? (Bow!)
How you acting like a little devil
Speed up, slow down, whoa now, gas pedal
Clap it, smack it, grab it, tryin' tell you
Booty dumb, booty dumb, yeah, that ass special

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz & (Kid Ink)]
Baby, you remind me
Mami, you remind me of something (uh)

'Cause you remind me of something
Girl, you gotta show me (uh, alright)
You remind me of something (uh)
But I don’t know what it is right now (I don't know)
'Cause you remind me of something, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, you gotta show me, yeah (uh)

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Yeah, bring it back, let's get it, baby (yeah hoe!)
I just wanna fuck you at the dinner table (yeah hoe!)

We don't get attached, we too busy getting paper (yeah hoe!)
Foreign cars, make 'em both lose they top
Just turned 21 and she fiendin' for shots (hey)
Heard she from the west coast, all she fuck with is Pacs
So I give her California love while I'm high (yeah)
Like, you remind me of somethin' (yeah hoe!)

Pull a Lambo round back, Bel Air we down there (yeah hoe!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz & (Kid Ink)]
Baby, you remind me
Mami, you remind me of something (uh)

Girl, you gotta show me (uh, alright)
You remind me of something (uh)
And I don't know what it is
But I don’t know what it is right now (I don't know)
'Cause you remind me of something, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta show me, yeah (uh)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Kid Ink]
Baby, if you know what it is, ooh, baby
On a real, can’t lie, man, you just my type
Hands in the air looking for a bitch right now, ooh, baby
On a real, can’t lie, man, you just my type

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz)
Two red girls, eating red beans and rice
We Popeye's, eat hot fries
You should see what I got parked outside
I kiss my girl every time I'm at a stop sign
My ex left me for another nigga
Now she realized she stuck with a sucker nigga
Uh yeah you a go getta', then you should go get her
The type to put Forgiatos on a four wheeler (tell 'em!)
I put five ladies on a four seater (damn)
I'm getting money and you sayin' I'm a broke niggar (true)
I'm straight from section 8, I save coupons
Just bought a car, that bitch came with Grey Poupon (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz, Chris Brown & (Kid Ink)]
Yeah, baby, let me put your panties to the side, hee, hee, hee, hee (uh)

I don't even know what it is, yes, you
But I don’t know what it is (I don't know)
'Cause you remind me of something
Girl, you gotta show me (uh, alright)
You remind me of something (uh)

'Cause you remind me of something, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Girl, you gotta show me, show (uh)
