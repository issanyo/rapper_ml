I tried to give her everything she couldn’t handle
I like her good…
Maybe it’s me!
I’m so cold, I think I can melt candles
And while you’re sitting on the beach
Trying to get a tan, I just pulled a tendon
Boy, you’re so sexy, you think you got a mate
You smile when you like it away from me
You’re talking not two sides of your face
But I’m supposed to go, well I’m not OK!

Chorus:
I’m so guarded, I’ve been hurt, see
I’m so cold now, someone burned me
Yeah, I like you, I get you like me
But I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Oh, you got me guarded like an army grenade
Don’t hurt me, I don’t have what it takes
If you wonder why I’m going your shade
Your charades!
I like.. like rubbers
I like different kind of shapes, different swaggers
Oh, oh, but I can see beyond the face of a kiss
Oh, if something’s deeper I’m so …

Chorus:
I’m so guarded, I’ve been hurt, see
I’m so cold now, someone burned me
Yeah, I like you, I get you like me
But I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Oh, you got me guarded like an army grenade
Don’t hurt me, I don’t have what it takes
If you wonder why I’m going your shade
Your charades!
Crossing the line is something that I wouldn’t do
Me and your brother, we’ve been cool since back in middle school
And now I’m thinking beautiful, two crosses on the spiritual
I am counting dead presidents off in the living room
Feeling you my Zeus, yeah they call me Deuce
They sure are for seducing, introduce you to my coop
Coop, this is baby! Baby, this is Coop
Those deals acting shady, I put them in the caboose
The end to the end, I’m talking me and you
Who? Ain’t no I, I hit it for like an hour
Hit it like.. she won’t need a towel
And she like I!

Chorus:
But I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Your charades
I can see, I can see, I can see
Oh, you got me guarded like an army grenade
Don’t hurt me, I don’t have what it takes
If you wonder why I’m going your shade
Your charades!
I can see your charades
Yeah, uh!
