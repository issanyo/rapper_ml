[Intro: Ciara]
Let me in your head, watch you learn some
Tryna see you sweat, watch you burn some
(Uh-huh, eh, uh-huh, sweat!)

[Verse I: Ciara]
Yo, yo, I peek game cause I came with it
Uh, insured with a claim with it
Some say that's pimpin' yo
Cause the boys in the black get gettin' my dough
I'm too digital
Tryna get it in, in the telefono
Turn up, I'm going in
Now we can let it all out on the floor

[Pre-Hook]
I show you how to move to my tempo
Yeah I know you like this tempo
You don't know what you in for
I'm about to give you that info

[Hook]
You let me in your head, watch you learn some
Tryna see you sweat, watch you burn some
Let me in your head, watch you learn some
Tryna see you sweat, watch you burn some

Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-watch you learn
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-watch you learn
Sweat, sweat!

[Verse II: Ciara]
I can teach you a lot of cool shit
Never met a girl that can do this
That PG got you actin' up
Well I'mma put you in my movie
You Ricky, I'm Lucy
All in your mind, don't lose it
That bomb bomb so bomb bomb
You sayin' hallelui

[Pre Hook + Hook]

[Verse III: 2 Chainz]
You gone learn today, you gone earn today
I be Interscope like Aftermath
Get on the Rosay, do it the wrong way
Might do foreplay, after sex
They ask me, how I'm doing and I tell them, "I'm very blessed"
And I see, see Cici in that CC and me chest to chest
These pheromones, no body odor
Carry on, on my shoulder
LV the logo, make your hair weave get done over
When she pop that, I rock back
Drop that, I rock back
Big stone, I cop that
Don't act right, I want my rock back

[Hook: Ciara]

[Breakdown]

[Outro: Ciara]
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-watch you learn
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-watch you learn
La la la la la la la la la la la la la, sweat!
La la la la la la la la la la la la la, sweat!
La la la la la la la la la la la la la, sweat!
La la la la la la la la la la la la la, sweat!

I'm done!
