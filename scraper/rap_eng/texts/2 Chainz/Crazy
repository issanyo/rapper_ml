Didn't I tell you what you meant to me
But I gotta move on
I'm not afraid of what they say please just believe
That I gotta move on

Look what you did to me
Look what I've done for you
I gave my all to you
And now we through

CHORUS

It's crazy (crazy, crazy)
Holding my hands but your heart was far from me
(baby, baby)
So hard to believe I thought you were part of me

So lost, confused
I never knew what you felt for me
It's time to leave
I never knew if you loved me

I never knew if you loved me
