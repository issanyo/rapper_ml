[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
With my back against the wall ain't no pressure (that shit)
When the beef is really on, ain’t no texting
Pull up real slow in a taxi
Gunshots turn em into athletes
I was hungry for a mil I gotta have it
Drove a couple couple cars up the mansion (Nah foreal at one time)
Smoked a whole seven sitting in the traffic
And niggas couldn't beat me if they practiced
Used to use my safe for a mattress
Used to use my mattress for a safe
See I could count a hundred thousand backwards (99, 98, 97.)
And I'm just tryna get it every day
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers
They feigning for the trappers and the rappers
And now I'm all of that, shawty what’s happenin'

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Everything I know( everything I know, everything you know)
Used to hustle at the store (Used to hustle at the store)
Used to get it with my bros (with my bros you know)
Used to bet on tenfold (I bet I hate it)
Now I'm all around the coast (you know what I am saying)
I be all up on the boat (alright, yay i get it)
I be smokin' on that gas (you know what I am saying)
It might make them bitches choke ([?]all this shit)
Old school with the rallies (real good, not for real)
Used to meet them up at rallies [?]
So it’s fuck your P (ok what you say bro does that mean)
The streets have taught me how to get it (get it)
