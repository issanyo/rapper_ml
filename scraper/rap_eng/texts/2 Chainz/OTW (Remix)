[Chorus: DJ Luke Nasty]
Doing 80 in a 60, fuck a ticket, fuck this
I haven't had that pussy in a minute, in a minute
I told here when I did it I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it
She told me that she want it, I'll be there when I'm finished
Ooh, girl, I'm on the way, aye
How'd you let the club in them bottom make 'em play 'em?
I'm on the way
Wait, she told me that she cooking
I said go on and make a plate, I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1: DJ Luke Nasty]
Ooh, girl, I'm on the way, you know you're on my mind
I see you getting thick from behind and them thighs
She looked at me like Nala, said "nigga, why you lyin'?"
Girl, with all the shaking, might as well come with fries
Love it when she cook steak and taters on the side
That grown woman shit, might as well add some wine
She like "baby, hurry up so we can take our time"
Fine, I'mma call you when a nigga outside, aye

[Interlude: DJ Luke Nasty & Woman]
Hello?
Where you at?
I'm coming
Baby, where are you?
Chill, let me get my charger out the outlet
Me say where yuh deh?
Baby, let me finish putting on my outfit
I'ma be honest, I ain't even left the house yet

[Chorus: DJ Luke Nasty]
Doing 80 in a 60, fuck a ticket, fuck this
I haven't had that pussy in a minute, in a minute
I told here when I did it I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it
She told me that she want it, I'll be there when I'm finished
Ooh, girl, I'm on the way, aye
How'd you let the club in them bottom make 'em play 'em?
I'm on the way
Wait, she told me that she cooking
I said go on and make a plate, I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Shea Butter on my face, different color laces
Ass clapping, standing ovation, alright
I can get you fly if we fly to Dubai
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
I just bought a bottle just to toast
I ain't paid yet, bought another bottle for the hoes
She a closet freak so I fucked her on some clothes
And I'm a d-boy so I fucked her on the stove
Yeah, baby, on the way
Try to fuck with me and I put her on the waiting list
Baby, dead a lame, put 'em on the hating list
Planning getting money, he ain't even making cents
Mr. Pay-Your-Rent, pussy better have a good scent
Double cup filled up with Prince
Deep tissue when I'm counting tens
Yeah, I'm getting paid ever since on
The way to your residence

[Chorus: DJ Luke Nasty]
Doing 80 in a 60, fuck a ticket, fuck this
I haven't had that pussy in a minute, in a minute
I told here when I did it I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it
She told me that she want it, I'll be there when I'm finished
Ooh, girl, I'm on the way, aye
How'd you let the club in them bottom make 'em play 'em?
I'm on the way
Wait, she told me that she cooking
I said go on and make a plate, I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
I'm on the way
Aye, aye, aye, aye
