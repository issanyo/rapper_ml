[Intro: Beyonce & (The Dream)]
People think I'm crazy but I love you cause you crazy too
(RADIO KILLA)

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Red light special, undress me under the candle light
Turnt up in this business, watch me do all of them things you like
I'm ready to go, ready to blow like Grammy night
In the back of that limousine, Billy Bob and Angeline
All you gotta do, is say the word
And I'll be right there on ya
All you gotta do, is say the word
And I'll be right there for ya
Do this while I do that, we like "good, true that"
Come baby be you, get on it while I see you
Turnt up, all the way to the ceiling
Burnt up, till you ain’t got no feeling
On my phone like Siri, talkin bout you gon kill it
Beat it up, until I black out; cash up, boy

[Hook: The Dream, Beyonce & (2 Chainz)]
I need this sexy (ratchet) sophisticated (ratchet)
The black leather with the sun outside in the summer time (ratchet)
She need that cocky (ratchet) ready to cock back (ratchet)
That drop top, and B symbol, on me with a (ratchet)
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woah
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woah
Loving everything you do, baby I'm in love with you
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woah
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, woah
People think I’m crazy but I love you cause you crazy too

[Verse 2: The Dream]
You’re my black light special, she hotter than a flame tonight
Burn up in this, and watch you do all the things I like
Say you the reason why all of these rap niggas start singing
She say you the reason why all of these cute girls got babies
All you gotta do is say what’s happening
And I’ll be right there baby
All you gotta do is say what’s popping
And I’ll be right there shorty
My phone, like: "Siri, I told you I was gon killed it"
Got my chains all on that jelly; Where Michelle at? Where Kelly?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Got a picnic table my automo
Pull up, blow the horn and we gotta go
You come out lookin like a pot o gold
Now they tryna cramp our style, Charley Horse
I'm like what's yo name? What's yo phone number?
I kill that thang (woah) -- manslaughter
You so sexy man I ain't flexin
Shorty I'll drink your bath water
Ferragamo's are my loafers got my loafers on the sofa
And I'm drinkin out the bottle man I'm gonna need a bib
Lookin like a kid tell you what it is
Tell you where to go man I tell you what I did
Ye ain't kickin it you get kicked out
I don't bring sand in my beach house
And your body must be anticipated
Cause it already done leaked out

[Hook]
