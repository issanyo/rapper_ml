[Hook: August Alsina]
Man, I'm flyer than a motherfucker right now
Cuff your girl cause I might fuck her right now
Cause she fine as a motherfucker right now
Baby, I'm just trying to fuck
Don't mistake this shit for love

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
I'm on one, she on me
That's your girlfriend? That's not what she told me
It's all good if that's your wifey
Cause she can love me then she can come remind me

[Bridge]
I'm feeling good, ain't I though?
She looking good and she know
Once she dropped it to the floor I be staring
Even though she got a man, oh, I swear I don't be caring

[Hook]

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
It's 2 o'clock, dance floor packed
She checking for me trying to figure out where I'm at
But she came here with you, where they do that at?
She got you doing shit, she trying to throw it back

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I apologize for what I'mma do to ya, run through ya
God bless you, I'll chew ya, fondue ya
Dip you into the latest whip
And I'm allergic to hating hoes, they make me sick
What else? Flyer than a [?], never been a stressful kind
Cand be paying me and you benihana to McDonald fries
Both of them good, but what's gooder?
Big dog style, dog her out, no poodle, ooh

[Hook]
