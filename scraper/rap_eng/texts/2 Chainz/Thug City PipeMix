My nigga [?], just poured a 4 up

[Verse 4: Nephew Texas Boy]
Gucci like my sneakers, 808 my speakers
Still in the trap moving bricks on a beeper
We don't stop for red lights so I never use a blinker
She just gave me brain so you can tell that she's a thinker
Kissin' my tattoos, red tops on my shoes
Diamonds on my neck look like I'm sailin' on a cruise

I been geeked up for four days
I won't cook no dope for you, unless you buy a fourway
