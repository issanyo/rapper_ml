[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I pull up with checks on me
If you are broke, then you cannot stand next to me
Nigga, you know you cannot ever F with me
Shawty, I'm with got her legs in the air for me
She do it carefully
One more link up then we gon' need a referee (tell 'em)
And my car mellow like Anthony (yeah)
Too many rings, too many chains, too many racks
And some gas on me (bah)
Bitch, you know you guessed it—HOO—, flexin'
Necklace had another necklace like it's pregnant
And the necklace had another motherfuckin' 'nother necklace
HOO
Southside with a F, hoe
And the F stands for 40 thousand
That's what I charge for a walkthrough, uh
Met a girl, named Summer, in the winter time
Love when she fall through
Had that bitch sprung
Took her to the mall to do a ball through (true)
And these true confessions
I'm makin' the extras and yo' pockets Anorexic
Text her and said, "Send me pictures naked"
She said, "Is this 2 Chainz?"

[Outro: OG Maco]
Bitch, you guessed it—HOO
You was right
Still with my niggas and we flexin'—HOO
Bitch, you guessed it
