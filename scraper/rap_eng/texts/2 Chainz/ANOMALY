[Intro: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
Sometimes your boy misunderstood, eh
It's Dame D.O.L.L.A huh

[Verse 1: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
They peeped the way I'm wired
It ain't quite what they accustomed to
Come from what I earned
And I won't accept a substitute
So persistent with it, I'm a little bugaboo
Never let nobody pick or choose
When they loving you
Played the cracks by habit, that's a position that I done mastered
Exercise my mind, if they got questions, I got answers
Stand a scrape to the sky, 'cause my antennas up like antlers
Dropped my nuts like a OG
Got hair on em, tarantula
I'm really from the streets, but I don't look the part
Pressure on me, feel the heat
I don't take it to the heart
I be showing love for free
By design, this is art
High and low I keep it G
Been that way from the start
I hang around older casts to stimulate my mental
Five years in the league, to say the least, have been eventful
The greatest teams assembled, that ain't really what I'm into
They know so much about me, yet I'm still so suspenseful

[Chorus: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
I don't think I'm they speed (hate the way I speak my mind)
Toes down, both feet (I'm 4 times 25)
I don't see what they see (how the blind lead the blind)
Boy, I'm like a safety (sitting way beyond the line)
I don't think I'm they speed (hate the way I speak my mind)
Toes down, both feet (I'm 4 times 25)
I don't see what they see (how the blind lead the blind)
Boy, I'm like a safety (sitting way beyond the line)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Life is crucial like the club on Bankhead
Riding with the toaster they don't wanna break bread
I heard you tried out last year and got cut
Work hard, off-season, come back next year and start
No bluffing, all you talking is nothing
Balling out with no budget
Do this verse without cursing
She wear the diamonds, them purses
Anyone working?
This mediocre, we want more
24/7 so you can see what is in store
Today was a good day
They came out with new Dames
I came out in shoot Js (swish)
I shoot out in broad day
Reporting live from the blacktop
I've been hustling since Will Smith had a flattop
I might throw an alley off the glass like it's crack rock
And they got me coming out my bag like a Glad-Lock

[Chorus: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
I don't think I'm they speed (hate the way I speak my mind)
Toes down, both feet (I'm 4 times 25)
I don't see what they see (how the blind lead the blind)
Boy, I'm like a safety (sitting way beyond the line)
I don't think I'm they speed (hate the way I speak my mind)
Toes down, both feet (I'm 4 times 25)
I don't see what they see (how the blind lead the blind)
Boy, I'm like a safety (sitting way beyond the line)

[Verse 3: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
It seem like I'm a rebel, but I ain't, I get my two cents
Call it how I see it, some would say that I'm a nuisance
Famous life is sexy, millions they seduce them
Bring us in, take us out
Can only kill what they producing
But me, I'm self made
Let me stop and take a village
Numbers point me to the grave
Now I live a life of privilege
Why they watch me on the stage?
I ain't trying to keep an image
Y'all should follow what I say
I shop in rhymes like the Simpsons
I talk the talk if they ask
I ain't looking for attention
I'ma give it to them raw, don't ask my agent for permission
Only a matter of time before they notice the difference
It ain't another like him, everything he do prolific

[Chorus: Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
I don't think I'm they speed (hate the way I speak my mind)
Toes down, both feet (I'm 4 times 25)
I don't see what they see (how the blind lead the blind)
Boy, I'm like a safety (sitting way beyond the line)
I don't think I'm they speed (hate the way I speak my mind)
Toes down, both feet (I'm 4 times 25)
I don't see what they see (how the blind lead the blind)
Boy, I'm like a safety (sitting way beyond the line)
