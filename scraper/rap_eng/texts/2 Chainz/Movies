All we do is make movies over here

(Chorus)
I was born to make movies, all we do is make movies (3)
My neck so retarded my wrist be cooling
If I'm arrogant I'm sorry maybe your bitch wanna do me
Stack it up like Miley Cyrus got these racks on me to prove it
Bitch I kick it like Narley stay strapped up with the tooley
I was born to make movies, all we do is make movies (4)
