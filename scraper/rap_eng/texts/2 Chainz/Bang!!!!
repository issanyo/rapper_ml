[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Bang bang, switch lanes like a drive-by
I am so fly, man I might as well sky dive
Black girls, white lies, you know that ain't your damn sister
Every time you on that liquor, all you do is damn lick her
Pick of the litter, man I'm dogging that
Kitten, are you kidding that?
Like a head roll, this gon get horrific
I like mine real specific, that's petite with a big purse
And some tattoos and a hairdo
I'mma whip it till my wrist hurt
I'mma get it to the dessert
Eat her up like dessert
Heard that you been a bad bitch, I did my research

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
Girl, you know it
You sexy, love how you show it
Yeah you bad, explosive
Go tell them bloggers that they can quote me
You got that bomb bomb
B-b-b-bomb that bomb
Booty clapping the thunderstorm
Girl you know you t-turn me on really
You go hum hum when them cameras on
I think got it all from your mom
Please correct me girl if I'm wrong
Easy, your booty

[Pre-Hook: Lloyd]
And how you drop it just makes me wanna beat it up
Slow it down and speed it up up (your body bang)
See that bubble butt mixed with what's up in my cup
Makes me want you in this club club (your body bang)

[Hook: Lloyd]
Bang bang bang bang
Your body bang
Bang bang bang bang

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
Shawty call me Chef Boyardee, how I be cooking
The way I whip it up in the kitchen
My recipe for love, that's what you came for
If it get too hot, don't worry shawty, I can cool off
Down down d-d-d-down
Every time that you c-come around
I can tell that I l-love you now
Really for, really
Every day girl and any hour
Anyway girl I need you now
No delay girl you should just come see me, see me

[Pre-Hook: Lloyd]
And how you drop it just makes me wanna beat it up
Slow it down and speed it up (your body bang)
See that bubble butt mixed with what's up in my cup
Makes me want you in this club club (your body bang)

[Hook: Lloyd]
Bang bang bang bang
Your body bang
Bang bang bang bang
Your body body...

[Verse 4: Salo]
Uh, uh, my body bang
I make them doggies bark bark
Keep his soldier on march
When I drop this pretty little thang
I tear it up like "Beat it!"
This booty popping, slap it
I bet you fall in love with fantasy
Fantasy, fa-fa-fan-tasy, ay
Be my dirty boy-boy, let's play naughty ga-a-a-ames
Rock paper scissors, I'mma give you shivers
Giddy up horsey, I'mma show you how I ride it trigger
Uh, uh-oh daddy! I see you want my body
So keep biting your lips just while I bang

[Pre-Hook: Lloyd]
And how you drop it just makes me wanna beat it up
Slow it down and speed it up up (your body bang)
See that bubble butt mixed with what's up in my cup
Makes me want you in this club club (your body bang)

[Hook: Lloyd]
Bang bang bang bang
Your body bang
Bang bang bang bang

[Post-Hook/Pre-Hook: Lloyd]
And how you drop it just makes me wanna beat it up
Slow it down and speed it up up (your body bang)
See that bubble butt mixed with what's up in my cup
Makes me want you in this club club (your body bang)
