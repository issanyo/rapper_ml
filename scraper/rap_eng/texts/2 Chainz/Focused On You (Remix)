[Intro: Sevon Miles]
This is the remix

[Verse 1: Sevon Miles]
We takin' honeys to the crib tonight
Guarantee we goin' get up in they rib tonight
Oochie, coochie, really love the coochie
Ain't had none in a while, might go wild on her booty
Tarzan, jungle man, need that rubber band
Droppin' bombs on her like 9/11 Taliban
Goin' creepin' in the night, all black, Batman
Give her daytime super cock, call me Superman
I don't need to cuss cause she got a dirty mouth
She a good kisser and she love goin' south
Young buck for a young doe
She call me papi chulo cause I make her toes tingle

[Hook 1: Eric Bellinger]
While I'm feeling on your body-ody-ody
Uh, on your body-ody-ody
While I'm feeling on your body-ody-ody
Uh, oochie wally, wally, wally
You lookin' dangerous
I want you and it's obvious
We could be makin' crazy love
Whole world gon' be hatin' us
(Why they hatin?)
While I'm feeling on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, on your body-ody-ody
While I'm feeling on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Oochie wally, let me gon' and get it started
Lookin' like a molly dressed in Cavalli
Everything I do, it got gold on it
I just ate a 300 dollar hamburger
Change over to the lane that the game over
At the shoe range, paper rain, costs a Range Rover
Do my thang for the pooty tang, and the suit matches
Superman grabbin' Lois Lane on the booty
Told you from the jump, don't jump to conclusions
If you want a tan put some sand on your booty
Used to have a tat of a man on the booty
I covered it up, with my hand on her booty

[Hook 2: Eric Bellinger]
Let me feel up on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, on your body-ody-ody
Let me feel up on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally
You lookin' dangerous
I want you and it's obvious
We could me makin' crazy love
Whole world gon' be hatin' us
(Why they hatin?)
Cause I'm feeling on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, on your body-ody-ody
Cause I'm feeling on your body-ody-ody
Uhh, oochie wally, wally, wally

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
I really really really wanna work your body
I really wanna make you scream and shout
I really really wanna give it to you
I really really wanna turn you out
I really really really wanna work your body
I really wanna make you scream and shout
I really wanna hear you call me papi
I really really wanna turn you out

[Hook 2]
