[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Dressed in FILA, change in the beehive
7:30 nigga slick coupe with him, see ma?
I'm rich, my bitch, before and after, kept her well
Sit right there, enjoy the chapter
Bounce, 2 ounces get burnt
Thinkin' bread now, buy more lead, get the dread town
Let's smoke on the furlough king
Switch to Merlot, I know them niggas is bird, they swerve dope
Nobody gettin' it, whores is wicked with it
Little kids growin' up fast, teens is wickeded
No jobs, no checks, it's like rockin' an Olex
Rolex, her father is Cotex
Mother is so vexed, brothers is on X
Niggas is slummin' it, I'd rather see no necks
Dumb niggas, this the decade of bum niggas
It won't work, no matter how much bread you jerk

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it
Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I'm usually in the lawsuits frontin'
Comin' out Bank of America, big knot on me, I'm comfy
Roll the joints, jumpin' in joints, niggas with coins beat the point
And we want appointments, yo nigga, get some ointment
Stop playin', start prayin', I just might start sprayin'
Niggas is ass and all day with it
No style with no pals, niggas is so foul
It shows how I only fuck with real, them niggas know now
I slow down, don't wanna catch a charge and go down
I'm too large, drop a bag, use a marksman
Pause, said, "You don't want no parts of me, kid"
I'm just shootin' you real rap, so go wash with it
A legend with his hands up, suits is glammed up
I'm just bowlin' for millions out in Japan, what
Plannin' somethin', niggas ride around wearin' somethin'
Other than that or rap, I'd rather fade black

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
These niggas is dead already, I use machetes to eat spaghetti
They really couldn't ride a mile on my Pirellis
Bags so heavy the damns collapsed
Conversate about me, that's a chain reaction
Pressure to press in past aggression
Hope your body guard got pain protection
One in the chamber, middle finger, no fornicate
So many bullets in the clip, it's 'bout to sufficate
My uncle was late, my aunt ain't show up
How you gon' tell an old man to grow up
It's like comparin' Earl to throw up
Same frame of mind but a different poster
I'm 'posed to be what I wanna be
Dream so big for the world to see
First class, fruits and tea
And usually the only black man is me

[Hook]
