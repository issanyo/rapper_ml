[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Dreezy]
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm next to a nun, she naked
No disrespect to her, my check long as her confession
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none

[Verse 1: Dreezy]
I ain't tripping off no nigga bitch, nah, not at all
I post a pic and make him sick, got bitches logging off
I'm taking blunts straight to the face, shit got me nodding off
Say I'm a headache, but he just gon' take a Tylenol
I posting bout' no bitch, nah, we gon' bring right on your street
Fencing dms and them tweets like when you coming back with that heat?
This shit got em' shook, I ain't even that close to reaching my peak
That's somebody you trying to keep?
Don't let that nigga come around me
Back on my trouble shit, yeah
Ready to rumble shit yeah
Packing a vault
I got a sauce, he want to double dip, yeah
I'm finna level up on these bitches like fuck all that humble shit, yeah
I want the money, fame, and the whips, and whatever come with it, yeah
Showtime bring the whole game through the back do'
Full riders say good weed and enough food for a fat hoe
No flex, pussy so good, he wanna dive in it, then backstroke
Yeah, I been rich, this act broke like I peep shit then I act slow
But, I'm not nigga

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Dreezy]
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm next to a nun, she naked
No disrespect to her, my check long as her confession
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I'm shit cause I ain't never had no pot to piss in
Dick crooked like a muthafuckin politician
I like to wear my shirts with the fucking chains open
I drunk so much pussy last night I got a hangover
It ain't no sleep until I impregnate my vault
Swagging like I could play back-court for the Hawks
I don't even think weed strong unless that I cough
In my mama's house so big she went downstairs and got lost
Secret society, all we got is us
I know I'm blessed cause I don't believe in luck
Looked in the mirror like, "You the only one that I trust"
And she ain't even that cute, so I only look at her butt
King Tut with a robe on, Slick Rick with the gold on
Too Short with the hoes on, old school had vogues on em'
Told shorty better hold on, then clicked over said hold on
Then, I hung up on both of em', then put my clothes on
I'm gone

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Dreezy]
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm next to a nun, she naked
No disrespect to her, my check long as her confession
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none

[Verse 3: Dreezy]
Stepping on these bitches' necks like I'm a chiropractor
Everywhere I go, they call it Jay, say I'm a fire hazard
I ain't talking about no snitches when I say I'm with the teller
I got all different kinds of minks, but I need that spot like I'm Cruella
Just a south bitch for a quick trip
Big dreams to a little bitch
Pulled up in that four thing, but I ride a nigga like a stick shift
Got some little titties, some big lips
Don't get it twisted, might get yo' shit split
My drive ain't with the shit, so I'm getting high as hell when it lift
Like Wilt Chamberlain, every hit I drop a banger
Just point me to that bag, everybody wanna be famous
All my niggas with me dangerous and your sexy clip hanging
My ex won't let me go, call that nigga Cliff Hanging
Nah, I ain't going, so fierce to takeover
Beat a bitch, no makeover
Kill a nigga song, he ain't on it
Niggas quick to go fake on you
Now, they wondering how that rate going
Ain't shit free, make him pay for it
Got a pretty pussy, put his face on it

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Dreezy]
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm next to a nun, she naked
No disrespect to her, my check long as her confession
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
You nothing
I'm second to none
I'm second to none
