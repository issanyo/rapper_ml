This is The Unit

[Hook: Jeremih]
She said she want a stunner
I said, "Baby girl, I'm gettin' money"
Drop it down, get low, ahhh, ahhh
Can't forget the girl if I wanted
While she up and down on that pole
While she up and down on that pole
While she up and down
You got me sayin', "Yeah"
Drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low
Oh, drop it down and get low
You got me sayin', "Yeah"
Drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low
Oh, drop it down and get low

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I blew ten, I blew twenty
It's nothin' to me, I get money
I eat, sleep and I shit money
I can't get this bitch off me
I'm tossin' it, she want it (Want it)
That's the way we own it (Own it)
Sound crazy, don't it? (Don't it?)
I'm turnt up, turnt up
Them bottles come, we we want it (Oh, yeah)
Pass 'em out to my homies (Okay)
Shorty break it down for me (Go bae)
I done gave her half of that molly, shorty
Lap dancin' all on me, probably
Give it to me now, give it to me now
First she got me up, then she's goin' down
I'm finna climb that, I mean climax
We ridin' out, I'm gon' ride that
Triple X flick, we gon' try that
She can press record, don't rewind that, c'mon

[Hook: Jeremih]

You got me sayin', "Yeah"
Drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
(Yeah, 2 Chainz)
My hair longer than hers, bitch, life ain't fair
I'm gettin' paid off ad-libs, all I gotta do is say, "Yeah"
Ridin' around in that foreign, all your stories sound distorted
Got so many Cuban links with me, my chain can get deported
At the bar takin' shots, you are out, you need reloading
If you ever took a bitch from me, I come back to repo it
Dirty Sprite, I repour it, smellin' like the car dealership
And I don't think it's gon' work out
So bitch you need a membership

[Hook: Jeremih]

You got me sayin', "Yeah"
Drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low
Oh, drop it down and get low
You got me sayin', "Yeah"
Drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low
Oh, drop it down and get low

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Olé, olé, olé, olé
Look at '64's, out everyday, olé, olé

[Verse 3: T.I.]
(Hustle Gang over everythin', by the way)
Hey nigga, let me let you know how much I care about the bitch
(Fuck 'em)
I'm 'bout as cold as it gets
Only thing they get is a whole a lotta dick
Shout-out to college park where it's sold by the brick
Nigga, hold up
Sittin' on this table with the racks on go
Got some bitches with me, turnt to the max on go
But we with this shit you with, you try me we shootin'
And shootin' 'til the gun don't blast no more
Back it up to me
Grind on me like you tryna make love to me
And go and bring that badder girl in the club to me
That would make you the better girl in the world to me, for real
And I'm still ridin' one hand on the wheel
The other one touchin' the girl while she kissin' the other one
Makin' the faces like she finna bust her one

[Hook: Jeremih]

While she up and down
You got me sayin', "Yeah"
Drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low
Oh, drop it down and get low
You got me sayin', "Yeah"
Drop it down and get low
Drop it down and get low
Oh, drop it down and get low
