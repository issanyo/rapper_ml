[Verse 1: Game]
Walk up in the club with the million dollar airs on
Swinging side to side, like my hair long
Feeling like Tunechi in this motherfucker
Eyes Japanese, blowing sushi in this motherfucker
No true religions, just levi's, come on down to this bee hive
Your bitch love to play soft ball, I let her barrow them knee highs
She ride the dick like yee-haw, she don't fuck with no cowboys
I beat it up like I'm He-Man, she love fuckin' them G men
And after I score I do the salsa in the...
Victor Cruz in that Phantom, drop the antenna
I think I see some haters in here, I think I see some haters in here
Cock the ratchet

[Hook: Game]
(Dawg) Cause them niggas still mean muggin'
Nigga what you lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
What you lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
Bitch, whatcha lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
Man, that shit don't even mean nothin'

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yea, they mean muggin', the 3D version
Ugh in your face like Pee Wee Herman
Jack of all trades, no ace of spades
But I got a ace in my twenty ounces Gatorade
Shake, shake, shake it then pour it
I had me a threesome, round four something
Hasta la vista, wrist on freezer
Automatic weapon, chopper had a seizure
Fire, snap back through your snap back
Ran out of room in my trunk so I need a hatch back
How you niggas leaking, hope you niggas listenin'
Big money talk, why you niggas whisperin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Roll up in the club like I own this motherfucka'
Old niggas kicking jewels I'm like pawn up in this motherfucka'
Hoes wipe me down, Little Boosie in this motherfucka'
Rolling that La la, Fugees in this motherfucka'
I said Lala Carmelo, in this motherfucka'
Shorty wanna puff, J Lo in this motherfucka'
High rollers bank stop, tattoos, tank tops
Bad news, thanks pop, you man food, lamb chops
You know I run my city, please believe that
Got that work, put them canines on rehab
Niggas wrinkle up their face, we gon' iron that
Get Rob Cole game, he gon' let you buy a bag

[Hook]
