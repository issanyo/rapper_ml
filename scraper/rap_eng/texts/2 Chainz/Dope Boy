Every evening you will find him
Around our neighborhood
It's the old dope peddler
That we know by doing good

Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me

Most of my niggas got gold teeth
Most of my bitches got tattoos
Most of my niggas think cash rules
And I mess up hair dos like it's a pair of shoes
And I need a parachute when I'm up there
I'm in the trap cuz I work there

Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
Started off with a OZ

Pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me

When the shades of night are falling
Comes a fellow everyone knows
It's the old dope peddler
Spreading joy wherever he goes

See what these bitches looking like
Stick it in all crooked like
Louie V is my kyrptonite
Take ya bitch and I give her back
Give her this and I give her that
Fine wine and lobster tail
Candlelight and Chrisette Michele
Look at the pussy and play kiss and tell
Fix her hair then fix her nails
Even pay a few bills
Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal
And my whole crew ill
Pockets on fat burger
Going so hard you'd think I mixed the Viagra with the Soda
Staying focused
Black and white ice, polar bear
You hold her hand and I hold her hair
I pull her close and I put it there

Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
I said I pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
