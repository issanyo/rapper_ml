[Intro]
Last night I fucked a supermodel
Got head on the way home
She left her other friends at the club
Got home, and I fucked her with my J's on

[Hook]
And that's ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying
To walk backwards bruh
(Woah bring it back)

[Verse 1]
Take your bitch like I'm the dog catcher
Take your ass to the mall after
Spa day, shawty, kill that pussy, pallbearer
You from that RuPaul era, I'm from that hell nah era
Real niggas say tru, real niggas ain't you
I ride around with that yapper on me
Gun-clad with my Glock up on me
Surround your ass with so many shots you'll be claustrophobic
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit
I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish
My paper up, got your girl with her ankles up, gangsta boy

[Bridge]
She got her T-shirt and her panties on
She trying to smell my cologne
I can fuck her anywhere I want
I even fuck her on the floor

[Hook]
And that's ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying
To walk backwards bruh
(Woah bring it back)

[Verse 2]
I'm on top like a toup√©e, you on the side like a toothache
Box your ass, suitcase; I'm real, you ain't
Calamari, crab cakes, my closet the size of your dad's place
You lookin' at a star, I wish that they could add space
I'm getting money, fast pace
My hoes gay and my cash straight
He can't ball, he castrate, she the opposite of last place
Do it, bust it open, slow it down, Robitussin
My girl got a big ass, your girl got back pockets touching

[Bridge]
I want it all, I want everything
Balls out, I let 'em hang
Window shopping for a wedding ring
Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane

[Hook]
And that's ratchet huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying
To walk backwards bruh
(Woah bring it back)

[Verse 3]
If you pat your weave that's ratchet, my last album was classic
Shawty on my dica, backwards spells acid
She pop a P like a xanny, she'll use no hands and no panties
She rock like nose candy, you fuck with me, ain't no plan B
I'm a D boy with a degree, I sold dope in my momma's home
My girl pussy deep deep, so right there is my comfort zone
Born alone, die alone, mud in my styrofoam
She got on top of me like a stage, I said use my dick as a microphone
