Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
Damn right they got it, damn right they got it
I say lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
Lame niggas be quiet You in the presence of a real nigga
I say lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
Lame niggas be quiet You in the real nigga's presence
I eat your girl up for breakfast, won't save you no extras
Say she fuck with me cause a real nigga is her preference
Drinking like I'm from Texas, and you know I stay flexin'
And if you don't know I go by tity two necklace
Damn right I got it, damn right I'm bout it
Click full of killers, please don't get us excited
Yea we're smoking loud so lame niggas be quiet
If you fuck with us, we gonna start up a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I ain't stunnin' these niggas, I ain't stunnin' these bitches
2 cigarillos, look like extension
Yeah I'm from the south side, her mouth wide
My pack loud, My gat loud I back out, And click clack pow pow
Court dates Still Trial, My rep is a reptile
Now later, alligators, I step on a work like a step child
Pimp up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I'm down
Her phone off so don't dial
Dis right here is dat no style, I don't know how I do the shit
I'm true to this
True religion, they takin' swag with no permission
All year it's Gucci season, Gs on my belt buckle
Cocaine on my left knuckle, kill your barrel what's left of you
Damn right I got it, damn right I'm bout it
Click full of killers, please don't get us excited
Yea we're smokin' loud so lame niggas be quiet
If you fuck with us, we gonna start up a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
I'm a start a riot, I'm a start a riot
