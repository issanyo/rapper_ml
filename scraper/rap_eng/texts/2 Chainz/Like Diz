[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
They ain't never seen a nigga do the shit that I did
They ain't never seen a nigga driving nothing like this
I got haters, I got jockers all over my swag
I'm just, I'm just doing me, I don't know why they all mad
Here I go, they staring like they don't know what a star is
Everyday's a movie, we just don't know what the call it
I'm everywhere you'll never be, that's everywhere the bread at
I bet my haters pissed, they wishing that they never said that

[Verse 1: Roscoe Dash]
Cause now, they know I can
Everything I'm on is a hit, nigga know the jam
Track long, flexed up, yeah you know I am
Juice gang, ah yeah that's the fucking team
? you're a wannabe
Money in the bank and money all in front of me
Drive what I want, and fly where I wanna be, honestly
Honestly, we don't even drive at all
? Who I'm trying to call
? Yeah we go and buy them all
Pop bottles, get wasted with the finest broads, yup
That's boss shit
I should've played lacrosse cause I run it all day call me Matt Danowski

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Put my hands up, let me testify
Swear to god, I'm trying to make her legs touch the sky
You wanna save her, I just let her by
Aye, nigga straight up like the letter I
Shake them haters off of me, awfully
I can fuck your girl if she's right here and I was across the street
I can do this on and off the beat, do it constantly
Getting money's, that money with an apostrophe
Period, my girls legs look like parenthesis
And the chain so icey, should've came with a pair of skis
Let them sneeze uh, bet you ain't got a pair of these
And when the old school candy came with a pair of D's, let's go
Smoking on that petro, these Gucci shoes is retro
Trap house, on the same street as ?
Hair low, holler, dollar after dollar
Model after model, bottle after bottle

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Roscoe Dash]
Every twenty four hours it's the same shit
Them haters get back up on the same shit
I be swishing all day like a can't miss
Them niggas find out we fucking with the same chick, whoa
So they try and do what I do
Like I see them and they try to
Money lower then the IQ
Imma' get money,tycoon
Got a million downloads on iTunes
Never heard nothing like what I do
Bet these strippers wanna suck till their eyes blue
?
Yeah, boss shit must I remind you
Got more ones then a blind jew
Get money, get money when it's time to
That's how it goes when the Juice is behind you, but um
