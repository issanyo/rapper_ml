[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I want some, give me some
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face

I want some, I want some
Give me some, I want some
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face

[Verse 1: Cap-1]
It must be your pussy cause it ain't your face
Pull it out slowly, aim it at your waist
Shorty wanted bad, told me she can't wait
Just ordered out the wars, let me see that shake
Got a bad yellow bitch standing bow legging
She got a friend, I told her friend they can both get it
Everything paid cash, nigga, no credit
But I swipe it across her ass like I want debit
Use both hands, hold it, then she hit her body
I shoot it in her grill like I'm head huntin'
She make her ass clap for me, this just press on it
Hit the pussy like 'draulics let the bed jumpin'
Money on the floor, call it green carpet
Blunts rolled up, I let my ho sparkle
Rose coming with the sparkles on it
She got that 808, look at the bottom on it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cap-1 & 2 Chainz]
Hey look, she break it down, nigga, no hands
And she shit off from my lap for a pole dance
You should back that ass up like a dump truck
And I'mma act a fool with the fun bucks
Make her do a split while she getting dick
And I don't even hit it unless the bitch thick
Small waist, cute face, with big tits
And then I introduce her to the clique
So much swag, I'm a swag coach
She got ass so I give her what she asked for
Dropped that ass to the ground, call it ass fall
Then I beat that ass up, call it ass off
Rare bottom and some rare bottles
That pussy off the chain, man, it ain't a problem
I get her so wet she could slide on it
And then I hold her straight up and tell her dive on it
