[Verse 1]:
(Yeah, 2 Chainz! Yeah. Yeah.)
Here goes nothing
I'm suffering neglection
Just failed the test and got taught me a lesson
In first place, steady second guessin'
Yes it's in my second nature, destination for depression

[Hook]:
I'm goin' thru it, dawg. I'm goin' thru it (x4)

[Verse 2]:
I use my mental, I don't use a pencil
Come off the top, comin' from my heart
Then I made a turn, straight off the lot
Niggas know my flow, straight out the pot
And the work, straight off the dock
Cross the wrong path, you'll be straight at the doc
Keisha started crying, "Mama pray for me"
If my nigga cross me, he a dead homie!
Erase him, cremate him, we made him, replace him
Replay it like a murder scene
And I pause it
On the part where you mothafuckas bleed
I bear arms, nigga, long sleeves
Ride rims in the winter, nigga, cold feet
Yeah, no safety on the mothafucka
Run in the bank like Jason in the mothafucka, masked up!

[Hook]:
I'm goin' thru it, dawg. I'm goin' thru it (x4)
I get a pat down, I'm goin' thru it
I get a bitch, dawg, I'm goin' thru it
Goin' thru it (x4)

[Verse 3]:
One blunt, two blunt, three blunt, four
One blunt left, somebody go to the store
Get a two liter, don't forget the cups
Just bought a eighth, 'bout to pour up
Yeah, and that's about to go down
Just rushed the cup and I'm about to slow down
Mr. Miyagi you waste wax on the floor
I ain't happy unless I got stacks on the floor
Niggas bet with me, racks on the floor
And since I been winnin' I relax on the floor
Feet up, and my iron cocked
Nigga not grown, they gon' get they mind rocked
Runnin' shit like a Z28 IROC
From the apartments, dinner I had sack lunch
An AK and a UZI, got tattoos to cover up the bruises

[Hook]:
I'm goin' thru it, dawg. I'm goin' thru it (x4)
I get a pat down, I'm goin' thru it
I get a bitch, dawg, I'm goin' thru it
Goin' thru it (x4)
