You niggas ain't talking about nothing what the fuck y'all doing in my section
You niggas ain't talking about nothing what the fuck y'all doing in my section
You bitches ain't talking about nothing what the fuck y'all doing in my section
You bitches ain't talking about nothing what the fuck y'all doing in my section
Might get some work I might come up
My favorite hustler is Stunna
My favorite rapper is me
My bank account filled with commas
You niggas ain't talking about nothing what y'all doing in my section
You bitches ain't talking about nothing what y'all doing in my section

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I got them commas on commas
I'm rocking Polo pajamas
I went to jail, I might go to Hell, I used to sell drugs to my momma
I got a scale, I'm ducking from 12, eat Benihana’s like McDonald's
My partner got jammed, he can't see his fam, so middle finger to your honor
Fuck is you doing in my section
Fuck my girl with no protection
Fuck the world with no protection
She fell in love with my profession
I trap and I rap on the side of course
She feeling the ride of course
I had to style the Porsche
I got the loud of course
I wore a smile to court, flexing!
Ya you know I'm flexing
Shawty said she wanted Houston's, so I flew her to Texas
And my shawty so damn fine I charge you to text her
I got a selection in my collection
So why the fuck are you in my section?

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Walk around this bitch with a mean mug
I walk around my house with a lean mug
She pull my dick out and get a bear hug
And then the bitch swallow all of these cubs
I walk up in your house with machine guns
Catch you on the couch watching re-runs
Shoot first then I ask questions later
Nigga mad when I get no response
Been had hoes since peach fuzz
Been had money since peach fuzz
Shining on these motherfucking bitch niggas
I feel like the sun on a beach bum
My slime got the cannon and he a loose cannon
And I got the cannon and I am no different
I got that money, money’s not a problem
How you like my Spanish, money’s no problemo
Up in my section I'm laughing with bitches
I don't get the jokes but I do get the pussy
Smoking that loud I know you want to shoosh me
Don't need security my homie a bully
Take me a shot hit the blunt throw my set up
If she ain't fucking thats ok no pressure
I gladly tell her like Stuttering Stanley pl-pl-pl-please
Bitch get the fuck out my section!
