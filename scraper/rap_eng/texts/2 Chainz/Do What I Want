[Hook: Lil Twist] (x2)
Now, I got money in my pocket, I can buy whatever that I want
Whips in the garage, I can drive whatever that I want
Females in the club, I can get whoever that I want
I do anything I want, I do anything
Now, I got money in my pocket, I can buy whatever that I want
Whips in the garage, I can drive whatever that I want
Females in the club, I can get whoever that I want
I get anything I want, I get anything I want

[Bridge: Lil Twist]
I get it (x8), I do it (x8)

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I'm swagging out on them hoes and all them hoes be all in my shows
C-coming out of they clothes
You can't get mad your chick gon' go, that's just how the shit goes
And, plus, she in love with all of my bros cause real niggas always get chose
They steady stealing my flows, swag, rapping like they dope, nah
Been done that before, so I'm more like a swagger coach
Niggas throwing salt on me, laid up, pillow talking bout me
Don't you wish you was YMCMB?
When they look in the mirror, I'm all they see
Hah, T-dub-I-S-T F, he fresh
My bro Khaled say "we the best", fully game, I don't need a ref
My chauffeur drive down Ocean Drive, yeah, sunroof, I open mine
I can't stop, I won't stop, I put in work, that (overtime)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Pants came with them horseshoes, rest in peace to her hairdo
While I'm getting a lapdance, I'm so ahead of my lap view
This right here is that trigger language - that fire-fire! - I ain't even aiming
I shoot yo' ass in different places then I leave yo' ass in different places!
My life, your entertainment, ignore the ignoramus
My girl speak a different language, in magazines, I'm on different pages
Ace of Spades, different cases, drug court, different cases
Kill yo' ass, steal yo' ass, rebuild yo' ass, renovation!
Get money demonstration, valet parked at the central station
Y'all don't know my situation so it's "fuck y'all", penetration!
Mayo, mustard, can't catch up to my separation
And, now that my nigga is out the feds, we a motherfuckin' federation!

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro: Lil Twist]
Tried to tell y'all, I do it, I do it, yeah
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Riding round and I'm getting it
