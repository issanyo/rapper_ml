[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi and 2 Chainz
Tunechi and 2 Chainz
ColleGrove on!

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Mike told me this gon' be your favorite song
Ooh, wear that red one, that my favorite thong
Put 'em on, I said baby put 'em on
I said what you gonna do when you go home?
Kiss your man after you sucked on my woo!
She called my phone, I told her I was at the stu'
Last name Chainz, first name 2
Pull up on me, shawty you know what to do

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I bought some gold chains with my drug money
Then wore it on the stage just to stunt on 'em
That's how we do it on the south side
Might buy an AK usin' all 5s
Big booty bitches in my archives
Potato on the barrel for you small fries
G4, G5 jet
Export, import checks on deck
Once the DJ drop this shit
Make 'em shake it like Tourette's
Smoking on the top floor, I'm as high as I can get
Lean in the baby bottle, I try not to babysit
So I had to take a sip, if I like it then I buy
Got so many damn rides I put my garage on a diet

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
ColleGrove, we out here, all these bitches want this dope dick
And our pockets look like blowfish and we higher than some voltage
I got Trukfit on my back, bitch on this Actavis I'm active
And my acronym is HB, that's for Hot Boy, you a has been
All this bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, you ain't gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad, squad, squad you ain't hot like Häagen-Dazs®
Out here thrashin' with my crew, all you hearin' is, "Soo woo"
From New Orleans, that's voodoo got a baby with New-New
And I'm smokin' like Badu hoodie loccin', I'm Piru
No more YMCMB, hocus pocus, bye bye, poof
Bitch you mothafuckin' right, get a mothafuckin' life
Lil Tunechi out this bitch, drops the mothafuckin' mic

[Hook: 2 Chainz + Lil Wayne]
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right
Told a bitch you mothafuckin' right

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
