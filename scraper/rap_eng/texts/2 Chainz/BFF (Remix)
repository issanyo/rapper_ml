[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Trap down the street from Phillips Arena
Trap down the street from Phillips Arena
(And that cool with me, I'm fine with that, things change with time)
Hashtag makin' bands, yes I am
Hashtag makin' bands, yes I am
Nigga do ya thing, BOOM

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage
Young street nigga coming from the pot
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Done it, done it, done it man I'm runnin' up
Tity Boi 'bout to fuck the summer up
Order some new things for the Wraith
3rd chain on to get her naked
I'ma poster child for the hustle
You a poser child for them bustas
Game up for grabs, I'ma take it
Try to stay down like the pavement
Live by the code, keep it true
Anything and everything to get a loot
Nigga think they trill but I'm triller
Nigga think they ill but I'm iller
Nigga think they big but I'm larger
Pussy you ain't nothin' but a target
Smokin' on joints, gettin' massages
Keep dodgin' me and I charge up

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage
Young street nigga coming from the project
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Take the straight razor hit with the 50 slab
Bitch I move all of that weight I just might hit my dab
Niggas got that funny money I'm trying' not to laugh
In the back of that Rolls treat it like a cab
Got an F in science but an A in math
[?]
30 for the 36 you don't know the half
Movin' through my city like I'm Godzilla
Your favorite rapper seen a bird, it was on Twitter
Let me hear your bird call nigga tweet tweet
.40 Cal with the dick nigga skeet skeet
I think I fell in love with the kitchen sink
Got my eyes on that money I can't even blink
Any nigga bout that talkin' cray, think he need a shrink
Just copped a new Rolly had to lose a link
Kill him in the valet, murder was the case
Bitch I call my safe Mars cause it's outta space

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Whole lot of money that my BFF
Keep a Glock .40 in my Fendi belt
Getting so much cash I don't need a wallet
You smoking on that trash, throw it in the garbage
Young street nigga coming from the project
Hanging on the block, kickin' with the convict
They say that money talk so don't you make a comment
I'm proud of myself motherfucker I done it

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
Spend a little money you can't take it with you
They say the Feds out here takin' pictures
Spend a little money you can't take it with you
They say the Feds out here takin' pictures
Instagram, Instagram, hashtag makin' bands- yes I am
