[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Some broke niggas flexin' on the 'gram
I crack the grain, I'm just bein' petty (I'm just being)
My ex postin' pictures of her new man
So I smashed her friend, I'm just bein' petty (I'm just bein' petty)
Too fascinated with doin' the bid', y'all just bein' petty (y'all just bein')
Kick them outta my section, make room for the chicks, I'm just bein' petty
So many hoes in the crowd (crowd)
Gave us some coke and a smile (smile)
This weed we smokin' so loud (loud)
So high, I hope we come down (oh), yeah

[Post-Chorus: Short Dawg]
I just ran 'em bands up, ain't nothin' they could tell me (oh)
I was bein' patient, y'all was bein' petty (yeah)
Now we 'bout to pop, sparklers and confetti (yeah)

[Verse 1: Short Dawg]
Everythin' else straight, we turnt (slick)
In the snapback and Supreme shirt (sick)
Celebrate the money that the team earned (lit)
Stand too close, get your weave burned (oh)
But you sparkle like a January first (damn)
I've been there, nigga, do your research
Couple cornrows, go grill to the label
I'ma need a whole meal 'cause these rappers just dessert
Started from the bottom like I'm puttin' pants on (oh)
Now we spillin' champagne on the Samsung (yeah)
I don't make trap music or dance songs
It's a bunch of other side hitters, leave your fans on
'Cause everyday I see

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Some broke niggas flexin' on the 'gram
I crack the grain, I'm just bein' petty (I'm just bein')
My ex postin' pictures of her new man
So I smashed her friend, I'm just bein' petty (I'm just bein' petty)
Too fascinated with doin' the bid', y'all just bein' petty (y'all just bein')
Kick them outta my section, make room for the chicks, I'm just bein' petty
So many hoes in the crowd (crowd)
Gave us some coke and a smile (smile)
This weed we smokin' so loud (loud)
So high, I hope we come down (oh), yeah

[Post-Chorus: Short Dawg]
I just ran 'em bands up, ain't nothin' they could tell me (oh)
I was bein' patient, y'all was bein' petty (yeah)
Now we 'bout to pop, sparklers and confetti (yeah)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'm a rich nigga, still gettin' niggas robbed, I'm just bein' petty (I'm just bein' petty)
Niggas act like they want the smoke with me, but they ain't ready (yeah nigga, what's up?)
When they say they gon' pull up, we be standin' round, waitin' with the 30s (fuck takin' so long?)
I done did so much dirt, now I ain't even gotta get my hands dirty (come on)
That bitch be all in your house (woo)
I jump in, all in her mouth (ayy)
Is that what this shit all about? (shit all about)
This petty shit gotta stop (boy)
Don't make me get a chill, hit a chill
And slap the shit at ya, her pussy so good she got you tripping through the hood
But she ain't into ya, so she pretending he fuck with you hard so you could blow the back. What kind of bitch wouldn't?

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Some broke niggas flexin' on the 'gram

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Roll up a joint and won't pass it to no one, I'm just bein' petty (I'm just bein' petty)
Fuckin' in the night and in the mornin' time, I pay for the telly, uh (I pay for the telly)
Stingy like an only child, I'ma hold it down, spend a couple thou' for a pack of loud
Nigga, I will front and you are backin' down, down, down, done, done
This is a party to me, look at my roof, my diamonds so taller than me
I sold a base, like I was part of the beat, fuck you in all of the sheets, yeah
I want the work with them plastic bags, I stuff them, they ready
I treat it like billin' my folks in the sand and still got a celly, hello

[Chorus: Short Dawg]
Some broke niggas flexin' on the 'gram
