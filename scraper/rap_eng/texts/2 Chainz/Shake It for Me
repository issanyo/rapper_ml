[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
In the night when the sun goes down
And your wild side comes out
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
Soon as that door shuts
Turn the bed to a club
Baby, that's when you shake it for me

[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
Fingers on your clothes, girl
I been thinking that you always worked out
Living in LA now
But I swear you move like you come from the south
When we getting private
You show me tricks you don't show no one else
I wonder where you learned that
What you just showed me

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Oh I can tell that you're a pro girl 'cause you do it right
Then you become another person when I hit the lights
I could've sworn you were a dancer in another life
If I gotta know, I gotta know

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
'Cause in the night when the sun goes down
And your wild side comes out
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
Soon as that door shuts
Turn the bed to a club
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
And you go up and you come down
You turn around and then you poke it out for me
When you get my love and your body erupt
Baby, that's when you shake it for me

[Verse 2: Austin Mahone]
Shake it like a tambourine, girl
You see only you do that things you do
In and outta jeans, girl
Makes no difference to me to see you outta tune
It's gotta be magic
Some type of illusion, baby
I wonder where you learned that
What you just showed me

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Oh I can tell that you're a pro girl 'cause you do it right
Then you become an other person when I hit the lights
I could've sworn you were a dancer in another life
I gotta know, I gotta know

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
'Cause in the night when the sun goes down
And your wild side comes out
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
Soon as that door shuts
Turn the bed to a club
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
And you go up and you come down
You turn around and then you poke it out for me
When you get my love and your body erupt
Baby, that's when you shake it for me

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(Yeah, 2 Chainz]
Turn the bedroom to a nightclub
I got idea, yes a light bulb
Then I lay back, let you get on top
See if you can join the bike club
First you told me you don't like clubs
Unless you see it's the right one
Outta all the girls that left
I'm starting to think you're the right one
We make a movie and sequel
We don't need siskle and eber
I'm like an eagle that's eager
I turn to a beast when I need you
Wait 'til the dark when I see you

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
'Cause in the night when the sun goes down
And your wild side comes out
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
Soon as that door shuts
Turn the bed to a club
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
And you go up and you come down
You turn it around and you girl you poke it out for me
When you get my love and your body erupt
Baby, that's when you shake it for me
