[Intro]
When he dies i’ll bury him inside the Louis store
When he dies i’ll bury him inside the Gucci store
I ask him what he do and who he do it for
And when I say “I love you” he say that he love me more
When he dies i’ll bury him inside the Gucci store
When he dies i’ll bury him inside the Louis store
All he wants for his birthday is a big booty ho
All he wants for his birthday is a big booty ho

[Verse 1]
Savage contest you're in 1st place
I just walked into the room and saw you get to 1st base
I ask you what you do and who you do it for
Trying not to love you cause I know you don't love me no more
You could nourish me, you could destroy me
Fortunately I don't count on you to employ me
So I’m just gonna flip another buck around
Cause my mind is loyal and I never try to fuck around
Got a little booty so he call me little booty
But he's looking for a booty that is truly heavy duty
And you deserve it all, yeah you deserve it all
But I could never lean on you cause I don't wanna fall

[Verse 2]
Savage contest you're in 1st place
I just walked into the room and saw you get to 1st base
I ask you what you do and who you do it for
Trying not to love you cause I know you don't love me no more
But I was a loner until I met you
And I let you in after all the persuasion
You swear against all of the allegations
Tired of the phonies, trying to fake appreciation
You look so weak when you lie, as you stab me (so tired of the phonies, so tired of the phonies)
'Cause you look so weak when you lie as you stabbed me in my back
I looked you right in the eyes (you look so weak when you lie, as you stabbed me in my back I looked you right in the eyes)

[Outro]
When he dies i’ll bury him inside the Louis store
When he dies i’ll bury him inside the Louis store
When he dies i’ll bury him inside the Louis store
When he dies i’ll bury him inside the Louis store
