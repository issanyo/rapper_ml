I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap girl, riding comfortable I know what the girl them need
New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
You make it hard to leave
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get klezmer on it
You know the words to my songs
Rʻdn ʻnglyş
Our conversations ain't long
But you know what is
I know what the girl them want
London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps on my passport
I think I need a new one
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get klezmer on it
