[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I'm thinking about moving to Mexico (x2)
Got my raw paper filled with Texaco
All I ever wanted was some better dope
Better dope (x4)

[Verse 1: Cap 1]
Gold in a nigga [?]
The Window tinted
I got a tahoe for the heaters
[?] up on the money cuz I feel like I could get it
All of this work, I be feeling like El Jefe
Tatted up and looking like a ese'
Got a pocket rocking on me in the [?]
Got a hundred pounds or a gallon, out in one day
Break out the [?] and I bring it to you
Made it out the projects, holla hallelujah
Slanging the fish, on the phone, barracudas
Niggas shoot Rugers, putting hoes in madudas
Mace in my[?] hella coca
Step off the plane with work and Pennacchio
With the Mexico the bigger mocha mutha
Money keep coming, my cup runneth over

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Pull up on a nigga with the packs
Give a nigga this and serve a nigga with a strap
Told em when it come to the commas, think a nigga momma put her in a Honda, drive her straight down the ramp
Yeah I need a stamp, cuz a nigga might send it
You know I need racks, cuz a nigga might spend it
I could buy a back, when I pad that
All I ride is [?] nigga I'm allergic to hemis
I could take a brick and turn that shit to a Bentley
I could take a village and turn it to a mansion
I'm about dinero and I'm rockin' a sombrero
All I scream is church, like a nigga tryna pastor
Pull up (x5)
Damn boy looking like a computer
[?]
Still down the [?]
All I talk is chicken, like I'm wooping it at Hoodas
On the low man, low [?] noodles
29 grams if it come with the plastic
Got a brick the same color Alaska
Stretching the [?] like I would to a elastic
I can go slow then I can go faster
Been graduated, been flipping my [?]
I might move away, cuz these hoes harassing
