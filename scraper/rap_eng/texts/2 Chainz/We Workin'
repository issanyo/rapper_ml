My shades on in the club
And I'm hollering "What it do?"
I'm all of the above!
High and some Gin and Juice
Nigga I will spit at you and you and you
I am drunk
I am on that you don't wanna do it fluid
What?
I got a bank roll size of a phone book!
And it got me walking around slow foot
Supply & Demand
I am the man
You want it? We got it!
Pocket full of rubberbands!

[Dolla Boy]
I think the odds are-
High in favor vote for our side, outside
Galo on shoes
They not our size!
Ride high!
Keep big shoes up on my ride
Stay fly!
Keep it tuned up on my side
I rock the best
So they shop, is my shop!
Cause my rock's the best
When they stop, we don't
Cause my Glock's compressed
So may I suggest?
Invest in some Tec's and some K's and some Vest's

I got the scale in the car
We Workin', we workin'
I got the Kush in the jar
We Workin', we workin'
I got the soft and the hard
We Workin', we workin'
I'm just trying to play my part
We Workin', we workin'
[Tity Boi]
Shawty do the math look at my bag!
And we getting cash look at my swag!
Ya dig? (ya dig!)
We Workin', we workin'
Ya dig? (ya dig!)
We Workin', we workin'

[Dolla Boy]
Pops was a beast
So it made me a monster
A monster
Best of the hustlers, I do numbers!
Number, one of the ones who won't run up
I'm one up
To and I'm crusin' to Columbia
To meet a new connect
And let them see the check
Then let 'em see the tec
To know it ain't no fucking us
They love how we running up
Back and forth running back, quarterback
Common place, whole game intact!

[Tity Boi]
That D boy shit!
High talk products
Not reebok bitchin'
Every Impala's on beat that slick and
Need that sit and
I stash it in the bottom
Rest I tape it 'round the hip
And I'm flying down the street
And I'm rhyming to the beat
And niggas know I eat
Benihana's twice a week!
And getting to the money
Since a youngin' in the street
And put it on the scale
And we Weigh it or we leave
