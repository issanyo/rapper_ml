[Intro: 2 Chainz]
I’m holding it down for my dog
Mistah Fab, you feel me?
2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B.]
Off that Dirty Sprite 2, got me feeling like I’m Future
Got the Bay with me, got the A with me, nigga play with me, gon’ shot ya
Real rich nigga but I still shop with the boosters
Riding ‘round the city in that rari and that rooster
Yeah I pull up in front of the party
Whipping that brand new Masi
Mama told me I was special, I’m gon’ be somebody
Ten chains on, got me feeling like I’m Boosie
Trapping like a fool, man free that nigga Gucci
Sunday we in Harlem, Shahbaz know a nigga balling
Bottle after bottle after done turned me to a bottle-holic
Fly to the A on Monday just to fuck around at Magic City
DJ Esco, nigga let’s go, hit Holliday ‘cause he coming with me
We in beast mode, in beast mode, and everywhere we go we rep ice city
Rest in peace to homie Bankroll, one love to my nigga Tity
When you see a nigga throw up the deuce
I got so much money, don’t know what to do

[Hook: Mistah F.A.B.]
I might hit the jewelry store, put gold all on my body
Hop up out the car lot and buy myself a Masi
Every day my birthday, I throw myself a party
Pull up to the strip club and sponsor me somebody
I got so much money, I don’t know what to do with it
Don’t know what to do with it, don’t know what to do with it
I got so much money, I don’t know what to do with it
Don’t know what to do with it, don’t know what to do with it

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah I been pimpin’ since pimpin’ been pimpin’
I’m ‘bout three W’s, I’m wit’ it, wit’ it, wit’ it
Man in my city, bands I got plenty
Saying you can fuck with me, oh really, really, really?
Yeah I got my Rolex on, got your girl blowing strong
Run up on her like, “Um boo let me borrow your tongue”
Styrofoam matching the Yves Saint Laurent
Got a short temper but my paper long
Take her home, take her phone, put that shit on silent
Beat that pussy up, when I nut I stop the violence
I’m on autopilot, my auto need a pilot
Car super tall, the motherfucker need a sidekick
And I’m gon’ get money, I don’t need a fucking sidekick
I just left the Polo store, Polo on my outfit
Polo on my socks, Polo on my drawers
If I’m laying on your ho, then that Polo on your broad
Tell ‘em!

[Hook: Mistah F.A.B.]
I might hit the jewelry store, put gold all on my body
Hop up out the car lot and buy myself a Masi
Every day my birthday, I throw myself a party
Pull up to the strip club and sponsor me somebody
I got so much money, I don’t know what to do with it
Don’t know what to do with it, don’t know what to do with it
I got so much money, I don’t know what to do with it
Don’t know what to do with it, don’t know what to do with it

[Bridge: Mistah F.A.B.]
Catch my flex
That mean take a picture of these diamonds
Catch my flex
That mean take a picture while I’m flexing
Catch my flex, ooh
Catch my flex, ooh
Catch my flex
That mean take a picture while I’m shining
Catch my flex
That mean take a picture of these diamonds
Catch my flex
That mean take a picture while I’m flexing
I’m flexing, I’m flexing, I’m flexing, I’m flexing

[Hook: Mistah F.A.B.]

I got so much money, I don’t know what to do with it
Don’t know what to do with it, don’t know what to do with it
I got so much money, I don’t know what to do with it
Don’t know what to do with it, don’t know what to do with it
