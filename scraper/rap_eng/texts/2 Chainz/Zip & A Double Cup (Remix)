[Intro: 2 Chainz]
I'm Trippy (x32)

[Hook x4: Juicy J]
A zip and a double cup, I'm gettin' high as fuck
I'm gettin' high as fuck, I'm gettin' high as fuck

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Ziploc bag of kush, double cup full of drank
I get so damn trippy, in my mind I go blank
The top 10 get high rappers #1 is my rank
You say no to drugs, Juicy J can't
Today I'm drinkin' white, tomorrow brown
I am not a boxer but I'll do some rounds
With yo girl I'mma spoon in the hotel room
And if she ain't tryna fuck
I'm looking for that runner up

[Hook]
A zip and a double cup, I'm gettin' high as fuck
I'm gettin' high as fuck, I'm gettin' high as fuck

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Smokin' on a bunch of blunts
Sippin' on Ms. Buttersworth
House with a bunch of sluts
I'm 'bout to bust a bunch of nuts
Walkin' out the double tree, with my double cup
Got a nigga leanin' like he hit with uppercut
Ridin' in a such n' such, she like to suck n' fuck
She got that good-good, I'm talkin' touch n' bust
Put two blunts together like extension cords
Smoke the whole 'nother ounce cause a nigga bored
Take your main lady out and have her doin' drugs
Take your main lady out like I do the chores
Or, 2 furs nigga, his n' hers
I'm trippy all she do is sayin' give me more

[Hook]
A zip and a double cup, I'm gettin' high as fuck
I'm gettin' high as fuck, I'm gettin' high as fuck

[Verse 3: Tha Joker]
A marijuana plant should be my logo
Got my double cup ready for a low blow
Got her slidin' down the pole, no debit
Fuckin' hoes after shows, that's credits
I'm on like yo computer plus I got chips
32g's that's a winzip
I'm rollin' up weed cause I need it
And I'm throwin' up my state I'm bulimic
Shawty got that meat like steak escape
I should be on Top Chef the way I Wake N' Bake
My college bitch whippin' eggs on a hot plate
Puttin' sperm on her cheek, baby face

[Outro till end: 2 Chainz]
I'm trippy
I'm trippy
I'm trippy
