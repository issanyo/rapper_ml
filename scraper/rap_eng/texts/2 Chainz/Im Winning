Chorus
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Middle finger up to my competition
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missin'!
Verse 1
Pull up to the scene but my roof gone
When I leave the scene bet ya boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song
2 Chainz but I got me a few on
Everything hot skipped luke warm
Tell shawty buss it open off on a new song
Got a present for the present in a gift wrapping
I don't feel good but I'm trigga' happy
Bet the stripper happy
Bet the wizard had me
And I wish a nigga wood like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I'm fuckin so good it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down you got a bad atti(tude)
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
Ass so big I told her look back at it
Look back at it
Look back at it
Then I put a fat rabbit on a Craftmatic
I am so high... attic
I am so high like a attic
Chorus
Verse 2
2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly
I made her meet at the telly
When she meet at the telly
I put it straight in her belly
When it go in her belly, it ain't sh*t you can tell me
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
I paid a 1, 000 dollars for my sneakers
Ye told ya, a 100k for a feature
Eee-err Eee-err, sound of the bed
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, she get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck
