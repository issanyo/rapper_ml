[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Okay you know that I'm illy, my home is worth a milli'
My flow is 'bout money, and I still ain't got no ceiling
If I get a deally, it's no big deally
Cause I'ma ride your bitch and I'ma pop a fuckin' wheelie
Yeah I got flavor, I'm about paper
Doin' me daily, that's a mothafuckin' favor
And I got acres, I never met my neighbors
Got her on the D and I ain't talkin' 'bout Decatur
This that yellow paper, yeah I'm talkin' murder
From the South side, where all my niggas server
All my niggas workers, they know how to get it
See I'ma dog, come in your yard and take a shit

[Pre-Hook: Skooly]
First I fuck her, then I feed her
I'ma dog her, then I leave her
Off the chain, I'm off the leash
I do my thang, it ain't no secret
I'm the man
Would you believe it?
I do my thang
It ain't no secret

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I'ma dog, I'ma dog, I'ma, I'ma dog
I'ma dog, I'ma dog, I'ma, I'ma ball
I'ma dog, I'ma dog, I'ma, I'ma dog
I'ma dog, I'ma ball, I'ma, I'ma ball

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Dreads underneath my skully, name brand on my skully
Two bad bitches ridin' with me, and I'm still tryna fuck they buddies
Still sippin' on that muddy, still tryna get this money
Niggas start tryna fuck with me, niggas gon' leave here dirty
Niggas gon' leave here buried, niggas gon' leave in a hurry
A nigga start tryna fuck with me, a nigga gon' leave here early
I put the work out like recess, big feet on my car, T-Rex
I pull a titty out like eject, might shoot a nigga right in the v-neck
You know that I rock with the DJ's and me and your ho and my ho is on 3-way
I'm killin' these niggas like over and over and over, instant replay
My dog just caught a 30, Might dog a ho out in public
Got 30 rounds in my 223, when I ride with my dog, we thuggin'
