[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout my commas, I'm 'bout my come up
Young nigga run up, run up the summer
Tats on my stomach like Makaveli
Back of the back in the back of Telly's
With the racks in the sac I will rap on belly
They will act real really niggas acting sidity
Ain't no Actavis in the city, woah

[Hook]
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this is a real nigga role call

[Verse 2]
We spend it and get it back, we had invented that
See we on the internet, fly as an insect
Shine like the moonlight, told 'em gesundheit
I'm throwing cheese up like it's a food fight
They talking â€˜bout that dough and I tell you, I do not believe 'em
When I was on Codeine I went to the store and bought all of the liters
Follow the leader, monkey see, monkey do
It was critical bought the [?] went and bought three pair of shoes
Trapping all night, you know the rules
Trapping all night, it ain't no rules
I pay my dues, copped it in twos
And all I do is sell shit, I should go on a cruise

[Hook]
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this is a real nigga role call
