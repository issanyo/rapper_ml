Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
You tell me love ain’t been… your way
Cause you’ve been searching…
Said you won’t settle for less than what your heart is asking
And life’s too precious just to be wasting time
You disappoint me, it’s something that is so familiar
You get them… fall again
So you stopped trying to find your one in a million
And the language of your love, can’t nobody comprehend

Chorus:
I got news for you
Cause you don’t know how I do
I got ways to make you smile
They never knew about
In the corners of your mind
That no one has tried to find
Your time for love is threw
I got news for you!
Uh, I got news for you, yeah baby!
Your body is.. already with satisfaction
I’ve shown you pleasures, girl
You thought you never feel
Said you were flying like the world was far below us
You said there’s no way that I could take you higher still

Chorus:
I got news for you
I still got work to do
And you’re thinking that I’m done
That’s just when love just begun
In the corners of your mind
That no one has tried to find
Your time for love is threw
I got news for you!
Uh, I got news for you, yeah baby!
Don’t you worry about me leaving, no, no, girl!
Ain’t trying to be deceiving, no, no!
You said I feel good to be true
Baby I got news for you

Chorus:
I got news for you
Cause you don’t know how I do
I got ways to make you smile
They never knew about
In the corners of your mind
That no one has tried to find
Your time for love is threw
I got news for you!
Uh, I got news for you, yeah baby!
