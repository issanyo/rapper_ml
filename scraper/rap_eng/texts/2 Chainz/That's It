[Intro: Gucci Mane & 2 Chainz]
Huh, it's Bebe

Murda on the beat, so it's not nice

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & Gucci Mane]
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it (yeah)
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it (huh)
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha & Gucci Mane]
What you lookin' at's the real, ain't nothin' on me plastic
YSL up on my heels, I be stoppin' traffic
You be lookin' at my ass
Damn, that thing Jurassic
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
I be ridin' through West, dodgin' paparazzi (huh)
Diamonds drippin' on my neck, I be saucy saucy (burrr)
Damn, I'm dressed fresh to death, steppin' out the coffin  (yeah)
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
(Huh, go)
I'm on the top
Don't even get me started, 'cause I don't like to stop (huh)
I'm shinin' harder than everybody and I just wore a watch
Two bad bitches, one say that she just wanna watch (huh)
I hope she know she lookin' at a whole lotta Gwop
This bitch so bad that she deserve a whole lotta props
If he ain't gettin' money, she ain't even gon' talk (shh)
She spoiled like a toddler, ain't her fault
She love to call me daddy, I treat her like Pops
(It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it

[Verse 3: Bebe Rexha]
Multicolorful Chopard with the swimming fishes
Motherfucker I'm a star, I don't do no dishes
I don't ever speak or talk of you basic bitches
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
Pullin' up in that thing that's a little vicious
Barbies from New York, I hail outta Brooklyn
That's why all eyes are on, yeah, I see you lookin'
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz)
Yeah, I like my coffee cold, like my women hot (hot)
I like my spot big, like my car drop (right)
Revenge of the have and the have nots (true)
'Cause back then I didn't even have knots
Yeah, shawty look kinda cute, but her friend there look kinda cuter
I was on the MacBook computer, tryna go through the whole Kama Sutra
I did, I did, that's it, that's it
Mattress, passion, satisfaction
Ow

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & 2 Chainz]
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it (bow)
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it (ugh)
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it (that's it)
That's it, that's it (tell 'em)
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it (alright)
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it (ugh)
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, that's it (true)
