[Hook]
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, talking back, ya ya
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, they talking back, yeah yeah
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, boom pow pow
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, blaow blaow blaow

[Verse 1]
Diamonds talking back, they say "fuck y'all"
Rock Givenchy shoes like they All-Star
Say you turned 'em down it'd be old, dawg
Known to light it up like the ball park
Crib the same size as the Walmart
Yard so big I got a golf cart
Diamonds on me shining when you see 'em, boom bing
Diamonds on me shining when it's DM, boom bing bing
Diamonds on me dancing like it's Breezy over easy
I can borrow a hundred easy, I just got a call from Jeezy
I count money 'til I'm sleepy, ink on my body, graffiti
And you know I come from CP
Can't fuck no bitch with no VD, nah
Diamonds on me going bing bing bing bing
Diamonds on me doing their damn thing thing thing thing
Known to get head while the car park
Diamonds talking back, they say "fuck "y'all"

[Hook]
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, talking back, ya ya
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, they talking back, yeah yeah
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, boom pow pow
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, blaow blaow blaow

[Verse 2]
Diamonds talking back, they say, "Fuck 'yall"
Walk in to the VIP and yell, "Touchdown!"
Ain't wore the same shoes the whole month now
I am so high she told me come down
I'm like how, zip of loud, gun go pow
Mr. Chow, bling bling blow, bitches bow
Bitches bi, they liking girls and guys
Ill advised, got the Rollie winterized
When I die bury me beside the Cuban links
2 Chainz, a lot of Z's 'cause you niggas sleep
Pinky ring ping, index finger ping, middle finger ping
Whole lot of rings, whole lot of watches
Watchband ostrich, neck, wrist, faucets
Chain show 'em options
Rings so big you could go boxing
Diamonds talking back, yours ain't saying nothing

[Hook]
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, talking back, ya ya
Yeah, my diamonds talking back, they talking back, yeah yeah
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, boom pow pow
Diamonds talking back, they talking back, blaow blaow blaow
