[Verse]
BBQ, no key cools, no cheap shoes
Good sea food, good beach food
Should teach schools shit been cooped
Could thief jewel, unequal, illegal
I go to Gucci to mingle
Got 'em hot nose like a single
I make a left, hit the blinker
Hublot or the AP, both of 'em cost 80 piece
Mealtime, y'all can barely eat
I'm wired up, I can barely sleep
Told y'all niggas, most y'all niggas, showed y'all niggas
Coach y'all niggas, broke y'all niggas, smoked y'all niggas
Choked y'all niggas, poked y'all women
Had them chickens covered like Tabasco
Bales of weed down the street from the pasture
Got a garage filled up with Caspers
Me and my scale live happily ever after
