[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
A1, sea salt no steak
Goin' hard, green lights no brakes (no brakes)
So green, so white, snow flakes
Swap it out, switch it up, rotate
All the time so I'm talkin' to my foreign car
I wore a Rollie yesterday, today Audemar
How you doin? How I'm feelin'? Yeah I'm doin' well
If you care about her you would've bought her Chanel
Remember days that was hot narcotics from 12
Last night I told God I was them hell
New duffle product placement
Accept the applications
And doin' fornication
She got that condensation

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
Uh
Baby let me pick your fuckin' face
I'ma rob your daddy fuckin' safe
I love fuckin' you but I love cake
Been a crazy nigga out the gate, out the gate
Young wild nigga out the gate (out the gate)
Been a young wild nigga out the gate
Young wild nigga out the gate (out the gate)
Been a young wild nigga out the gate

[Verse 3: TK Kravitz]
My bros smoke back to back (woo, woo)
They hit the ground running for some racks (brrr)
If I don't the gon' fuck your hoe (what?)
Fuck her in a mansion then we send her ass home (what?)
On gang, on gang

But your daddy can get these hands tho
He a J, I heard that he been served before

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
Uh
Baby let me pick your fuckin' face
I'ma rob your daddy fuckin' safe
I love fuckin' you but I love cake
Been a crazy nigga out the gate, out the gate
Young wild nigga out the gate (out the gate)
Been a young wild nigga out the gate
Young wild nigga out the gate (out the gate)
Been a young wild nigga out the gate
