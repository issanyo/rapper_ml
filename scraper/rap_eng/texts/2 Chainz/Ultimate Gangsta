[Verse 1: Giggs]
Nightmares
Give these niggas hysterias
Jokers
Niggas is serious (mmm!)
Everybody's strapped up, posted
Chilling in areas
Everybody's got that pistol
Couldn't get near us (nah!)
Everybody's got talk
Everybody wants some
Everybody's got guns
Yeah, everybody's got one (yeah)
Hit him with the hand ting
Or get him with the long one
Man gon' get a little wrong done
Man gon' get him in the long run (switch it)
Hold 'em and poke that wanker
This that ultimate gangsta
This that niggas don't want no smoke
'Cause this that ultimate cancer
Niggas ain't jumping no boat
My niggas ain't throwing no anchor (anchor)
Niggas just roll up and smoke man
Niggas just going out gangsta (mmm!)
Niggas just roll up, want big noise
Niggas just blow up that tanker (bap bap bap bap!)
Niggas wanna roll with them big boys
Biggest authority stamper (yes)
Niggas ain't sipping no cups
So nuttin' don't flow with no Fanta
Thinking these niggas is wet
Now niggas is going out damper (yes!)
I said Batman
They thought man was joking
When I'm talking bout' dressing all black
A nigga was scopin'
'Cause I'm fucking this rap shit
Niggas is sulking (sulking)
Fuck your little chit chat talk show
Niggas is smoking (smoking)
Niggas ain't getting no cash now
Niggas just coping (no cash)
Niggas just looking Macauley
Niggas is coking (ha!)
You can just get hit with that .40
Or nigga gets poking (poking)
Man have got me thinking it's game time
When they see a nigga get coaching (yeah)

[Hook: Giggs]
Man have got shooters
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just ate them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them, ate them
Niggas just swept them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them (2 Chainz!)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I got to war in a suit
I hit the chick in a glut
The condo, it came with a coupé
The Southside ain't been the same since we launched T.R.U
This is the real street category
Rocking more rings than Robert Horry
Flow real nasty like a lavatory
No more of me in the inventory
Yeah, out with the clip on the side
I got my dick on her thigh
Wrists don't fuck with you lie
Pistol on 4th of July
Nigga, I hate when you lie
Bankroll thicker than Nicki Minaj
Ah, make em sit like a cigar
Ah, sipping the rod, you can smell it for a mile
Uh, check the stats, man
See what they do to a black man
I'm still undefeated even when I'm shooting jump shot
For some money in the trash can
And my holster got embroidery
When they see me they recording me
Got a grill, nigga? Show your teeth
They ain't yours, nigga, show your lease
Yeah, that man
I'm just running up a sack man
In the backseat with my feet
On the partition, simply relaxing
Tryna' put a line between me and you?
Call that a fraction
Thinking I don't know how to act?
Shit, I'm about that action (jheeze!)
Uh, drinkin' on that Act'
Shit, talking 'bout the trap
Walk around with racks
Walk around with straps
Walk around with SKs
Been rich for a decade
Tatted up like a esé
I really fell in love with how the TEC spray
Ultimate gangsta
I don't give a finuck
Pull up in a trinuck
Nigga better dinuck
Turn your ass to dinner
Save you for some leftovers
Run up on you from the right side
And shoot you in your left shoulder

[Hook: Giggs]
Man have got shooters
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just ate them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them, ate them
Niggas just swept them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
Niggas just get them
