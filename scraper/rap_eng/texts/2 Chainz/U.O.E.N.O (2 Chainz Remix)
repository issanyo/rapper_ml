[Intro: Future]
U.O.E.N.O it
Ol’ high class niggas
This shit sound crazy
Fly shit only
You know what I’m sayin’?

[Hook: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don’t even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
I came up from bottom, you don’t even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don’t even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don’t even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don’t even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don’t even know it

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Ay that monster truck, sit tall as fuck, it’s so big can’t even tow it
Don’t like snakes keep my grass cut, so low can’t even mow it
Sip Dom Perri’, little high glow, no no we don’t do Moet
If it ain’t P.J., no Rose from me ho, so don’t even pour it
Specks on Tom Ford, button-down Michael Kors
Always on like the refrigerator, I’m plugged in, ho, you know it
AP and that PK, wear a Breitling when I’m bored
Got a Masterpiece and a 41-millimeter, and you ain’t even know it
Keep the .45 in my pocket: ain’t gon’ show it ’til I have to pop it
Then you gone know it, damn who shot you, they don’t even know it
Hawks game f-ckin’ floor it, TV seat front row it
Rocko Da Don CEO it, ain’t gotta rap and you know it

[Hook: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don’t even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
I came up from bottom, you don’t even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don’t even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don’t even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don’t even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don’t even know it

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Got tats all on my skin, up to my forehead
Tryna hide all this pain, I don’t wanna show it
I’m about my dollars, I Creflo it
What’s the use of havin' that ass if you ain’t gon' throw it? (tell ‘em)
I say throw that ass (throw that ass…)
Got the city on my back right now, I’mma need shoulder pads
In every photograph I take – picture
Niggas know I got them priors – Richard
Jealous niggas I despise – pistol
And if she a cutie-pie, I’ll eat you
Got half a key in my car, you don’t even know it
I don’t have a key to my car, that bitch foreign
Ammunition on me, I Rambo it
Watch me swag over this beat, I’m flamboyant

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 3: Future]
I’m turned up every day, you don’t even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don’t even know it
We turn up in the club, you don’t even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin’, you don’t even know it
We came up from nothin’, you don’t even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don’t even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don’t even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don’t even know it
