Thinking back on all those days I used to grind
Thanking God for all this music in my life


Stared with Latifah, Melodie, Monie in the middle
(Mary Janes Girls Sample "got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your lovin'")
Roxanne And Bo$$, Dream when I was little
I grow up to be like "These ladies shaping my life"
Heard "paper thin", That MC Showed me The Lyte
Write only get better, Nikki D, Salt-n-Pepa
Yo-Yo And Rage, Almost fainted when I met them
Thinkin’ back on my one room shack
Got serious with rap
Heard Brat-tat-tat and shit
Look at the outcome, Wild Young
Record deal with Def Jam
Told em "I Just Want Fox's album"
I'm with my idols, almost signed to Kim
I hate that they Rivals, Yeah Shout out to Rem
Babs Bunny, Ms Jade, VWK my sistas
E-V-E, Shawnna, Trina, Rah Digga
Yes, Mia X, Respect women that go hard with me
And Missy Elliott The God to me
Jackie-o, Lauryn Hill, Lil’ Mama
Azealia banks, young MA, SIA, Rihanna
I just Admire women that keep the fire burning
Who created the tire, who keepin it turnin
One thing's for certain
Cardi B Out here workin'
For my girls in the battle rap circuit
To Minaj, one of the biggest stars on the surface
Y'all influence me, Gave life purpose
I salute Y'all, Yeah!
Thank you for your service


Thinking back on all those days I used to grind
Thanking God for all this music in my life
On everything, Wanna pay homage
(Mary Janes Girls Sample "got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your lovin'")
Oh, I just wanna pay homage
No Beef, I just wanna pay homage
