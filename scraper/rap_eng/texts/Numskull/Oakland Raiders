Yo yo, I'm from the land of the playas, slick talkas, and collar poppas
Narcotics, and boss ballas, pitbulls and rottweilers
Niggas wit gold teeth, old schools on gold feet
Killas, and O.G's, task force and the police
Mac Arth to Foothill, East 14th
Sobrante Park, Woodfield, Plymouth, and Walnut Street
From the Ville to Seminary to the rollin 20's
Wit ghetto celebrities like Big Feek and Little D
See the East Bay Dragons, it's the home of the Panthers
Where niggas slang tons of crack and feds catch it on camera
Throw you in the slammer
It's the home of $hort and Hammer
Boss ballas move to Atlanta, niggas stole our grammar
That's my ropas, that's my nephew
That's my weeples, that's my nizzle
Please believe me, go fa sheezy
Off the hizzle, do ya thizzle
With my niggas ridin' dopefiend rentals
Rock presidentials, slang crack, pack pistols
Every track got sizzle

[Hook: repeat 2X]
'Cause I'm a Raider, Oakland Raider
From the Bay to L.A. to Las Vegas
'Cause I'm a playa, a boss playa
And if you wit me pop ya collar shake them hatas
I'm a Raider

[Numskull]
I'm a Raider, just like my niggas before me
But I was a thief with out the open face gold teeth
And En Vogue was some fine ass Oakland Raidettes
And Too $hort was the first Oakland Raider on the set
Now Pooh-Man was a Raider when he was "Fuckin Wit Dank"
And Askari X was a Raider when he was a "Ward of the State"
And Dangerous Dame was a Raider when he was callin' hoes names
But I know, from the Lake on Sundays, to the five-o
Now we to Eastmont with the sideshows
But it's fun, and I'm famous, but I ain't tryna die tho
Niggas be goin' out in a gang but not I tho
If I have to go back to dope, I'm slangin for survival
Now Dru, pimp he do
If you hoein' then he pimpin' you
Tried it for 30 days, I ain't lyin', I ain't wit it, dude
A babysittin job, oh my God, that's a job
But I still wanna do it 'cause that's 100% I

[Hook]

[Numskull]
Hieroglyphics been Raiders from "'93 'til Infinity"
Some underground shit that just shook the fuckin' industry
And Humpty with his gone ass, a Raider in his own right
The whole D.U. camp'll get you amped on sight
Now Mystic, she the only female Raider I know
You the shit baby girl, I'm just lettin' you know
And last but not least
2Pac Shakur, nigga, Rest In Peace

[Yukmouth]
I'm from the city of dope, the town of the crack
I'm from the city of pimps, the town of The Mack
East Oakland!
Heat-totin, ebonics speech broken
Keep jokin', the Luniz 'bout to have the streets loc'in
Down South y'all keep smokin' hay
We got the killer 'dro and naid
Heron and kilos for days
It's the city of the Warriors, the home of the A's
Where niggas get sideways, shootouts on highways, nigga
East Oakland, bitch!
I'm a Raider!

[Hook]

[Numskull]
We Raiders
3x Krazy, Cydal, rest in peace Eclipse
Bad N-Fluenz, rest in peace Rappin' Ron
Ant Banks, Seagram, rest in peace my nigga
Black Dynasty, Delinquents
Richie Rich, 415
MC Ant, The Coup, Point Blank, E-A-Ski, Steady Mobbin'
All y'all niggas is Raiders
Raider, muthafuckas, what?

[Mark Curry]
Damn, what about me? It's Mark Curry baby
I'm not a Oakland Raider? God dayum
I'm the first muhfucka on T.V
I was the first one that did HBO
First one did Apollo
I can't get qualified to be in the Hall of Pimpology?
As a Oakland Raider, what?
Uh, I'm the first one on dubs, what? I'm a Oakland Raider baby
That's right representin' the town, Eastside Oakland
You know how we do it
East Side O, nigga, straight up take yo' ho
I was all day long, you know how we do it in the town
Cristal, big dank, that's the way we roll
Old school, sittin' on 20's
It don't make no difference; floatin', doin' it all
Ghetto nigga from the Eastmont Mall
