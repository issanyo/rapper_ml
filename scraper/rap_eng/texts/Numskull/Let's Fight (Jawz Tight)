Mad niggas want to talk about that East - West bullshit
But you know it's all bullshit

Got The Luniz in this Bitch

[Capital L.S talking]
We got to put a lock on niggas jaws, so we gonna do it like this, check it out

[Verse 1: Capital L.S]
Like lamp shades
Now they rant and rave
I'm raw
Plus I got more plants to blaze
Fiends came back with thieves
With files Long as Stant. Isle and back to Queens
We strap black Mac's with beam's
I'm tight fear
I'm that nightmare that killed that dream
My gat steam crazy buzz
I slit wit wigs, plus some bid for your baby love
I'll play the role till I'm grey and old
Haha
With your pop's on the bed roll
No doubt
I'm caught out with your daughter
South of the border
Colt made them Outlawz

[Verse 2:  2Pac]
Check it out
Is it, money and women?
The funny beginnings tragic ending's
I can make a million and still not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sitting in a cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus
Balling as a youngster wondering if he see's us
Young black males
Crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail this is hell enemies die
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listening
Got my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitching
Please god can you understand me
Bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
I'm making a point to make my beat bumping raw life
Drop some shit to make these stupid bitches jaws tight

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them motherfuckers jaws tight
Now
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them motherfuckers jaws tight

[Verse 3 : Tek]
Chi-Chi bong water bong
'Nough weed for everyone
Enter the class now we kill you with sound
See bad boy with gun, who buss jus' fi' fun
Or black youth them move about a three ton
Soldier from jungle never take back free shot's
But that ended up at when man [?] fly

[Verse 4: Buckshot]
The impulse makes your body pulse beat off a beat per minute (Ohhhh)
As I get up in it
Construction no limit
Pin it like a cat in a dog fight
We gone get it on tonight
For all y'all who put up the wall to stall
But didn't realize that the weak would fall
The best pick out of the crop of MCs got rocked by the fact of realness
Stop, the shit, block parties was a thing of the past (Thing of the past)
Motherfucking club hopping was suppose to last (Suppose to last)
But all I see
Is niggas by the mass (By the mass)
Fuck even bitches came to kick some ass (Kick some ass)
But don't keep the club close that ain't my fault (What?)
Take them back to a grain of salt (To a grain of salt)
Take the indigence ever since BDI went solo (Oh)
I hold my cash [?] for a dollar

[Chorus 2Pac]
Let's, go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them motherfuckers jaws tight
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them motherfuckers jaws tight

[Verse 5 : Steele]
Up to bring them dukes up
Fuck niggas up 'till they puke up
Shoot up the party if they don't let me in
Get my whole click to let me in
Outlawz

[Verse 6: EDI]
I told 'em
I told 'em
I told 'em
Shut the fuck up
Your voice is hurting working my last nerve
Yo that's my word I'm about to take off
Break off a chunk of this trick ass chump
Who's knowing deep in his heart
He ain't wanting to see no funk
When he drunk
Yeah that nigga done go to him
Ran through him got him thinking he can ruin
Now he thinking I'm pursuing
Who's in, the motherfucking house
(Outlawz)
'97 we put some paw's on these motherfuckers jaws

[Verse 7: Numskull]
I see the same old shit blame it on the jabber jaw's who blabber all nigga's business
Shut your mouth before I shit in it
I got the strength to make their jaw's tight don't forget ho's I got the game to make their draw's right
Don't go Hollywood
That's what they tell me
They bought my fucking tape but I can see that they ain't felt me
Heard what I said they started churpin' like birdies
Drunk off rum bumpin' gum's like girlies
Puttin' they lip's all on my Henn' bottle
Nigga slow down put on the brakes on all that chin gobble
Squabble squabble nigga this is Oakland Beirut
Stop opening up your jaw's thinking that this whole shit it's cute

[Verse 8: Napoleon]
But it's this I'm hearing
That young Napoleon is disappearin'
But I cancel that shit for I reverse on this clip
And leave you fucked left right something evil
All my life I've been trapped down by my own people

[Verse 9: Kadafi]
I'm on some shit to make your tummy's turn
Full clip's ready to pull quick
Fuck all that bullshit I ain't concerned
It's evident
I need dead president's the city slicker
Jersey jigger
Feel my residence from we turn

[Verse 10: Napoleon]
Talk about times is hard
Come take a trip down my boulevard
At your own risk
Got niggas that's homeless
But'll leave you scared

[Verse 11: Kadafi]
Trapped in these bar's of crime
Droppin' picture my nine hittin' cowards up from there feet to there spine
In this game all rules apply
With no exception's all niggas die living high
With no easy exits

[Verse 12: Napoleon]
Leave your body over chocking when this gat get to smoking
All you pussies from here to Hoboken
Leave niggas jaws tight

[Chorus till fade]
