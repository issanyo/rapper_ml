(11 o'clock News!)

[Chorus 2X: (Numskull) & Yukmouth]
(11 o'clock News!)
Live and direct! Yay Area, they carry a 4-5 and a Tec
When they bury ya, they pissing on the side of your grave
No witnesses but a buckshot from inside of the gauge

(11 o'clock News!)

"Watch your own back, son" my dad always told me
But that wasn't in my mind while the electrical gate closing slowly
I was thinking about my pussy upstairs, waiting patiently
Not knowing that it's two niggas outside with Tecs casing me
Before I know it, the barrel's facing me, I'm deadlocked
The pistol in my rib cage, neck is in a headlock
I kept the fuck quiet so I could peep these niggas identity
It might could be some crew, they might just be some kins of me
One shot to the cranium, my mind's kinda wonderous
I've been flossin' too much, it's about time I got some of this
Hardcore haterism, my time was up
One nigga called me by name I'm like "What the fuck?"
Stuck my head up, I heard a car in the garage
And that's when the whole fucking scene had to pause
I thank God 'cause whoever it was saved my fucking life
I caught eye contact, aw shit, it's my wife
The nigga who had his hands free went straight for my honey
So I knew this robbery wasn't for no motherfucking money
They took my pretty out of the car and put me in it
Drove off and that's when I knew a nigga was finished
They put me in the trunk of my own shit
Smashed off, twelves bumpin'
My girl screaming but can't do nothing
We drove for like 20 minutes, and once we stopped
They took me outta the trunk by an old ass barber shop
And asked me: "Who could we call to get some cash?
And if you don't do it quick then your punk ass won't last!"
I dialed 6-6-7-6-7-6-7, 1-2-3, 4-1-1, 9-11
I got my ass whipped while we was waiting for the call
Kicked in my head and stomped on my balls
I just couldn't take no mo' and stopped moving
I couldn't feel nothing, my whole shit was ruined
They threw me in the back of the trunk where I slept the whole day
'Til I got enough strength to kick the seat away
Drove myself home, laid out on the couch
Drunk a whole fifth, a nigga passed out

[Chorus]
