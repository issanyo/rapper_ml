[Hook - Mike Marshall]
I got 5 on it
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got 5 on it
Fuckin with that Indo weed
I got 5 on it
It's got me stuck and I'm tore back
I got 5 on it
Nigga lets go half on a sack!

[Verse 2 - Knumskull]
I take a sack to the face whenever I can
Fuck a crutch; I be smoking that shit
Til the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a Tampa
To burn slow so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, brah
Hoes want to hit but they know they got to pitch in
Then, I roll a joint that's longer than your extension
Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Fuck that, you better bring your own shit chief
Wassup, don't babysit that
You better pass the joint
Nigga stop hitting cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open homie and guzzle it
Cause I know the weed in my system is getting lonely
I gotta take a piss test for my P.O
I know I failed cause I done smoked hella weed, bro
An every time we with Chris
That nigga rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me

[Dru Down]
Lit to the fullest extreme
There was getting no higher
That shit had my chest on fire
Dru Down was swigging to the face straight
But I ain't fuckin with that
I think I'll stick to the crazy 8's
Bring me a bottle and I'm cool with that
I'mma a lounge with that
Nigga bring me a phat sack
I don't know how to roll
But I know how to smoke!
I think I'm gonna hit it til my ass choke

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Woo-wee! Baby-boy!
I'm hella high, damn that's that indo
Only Oakland got that Doja like that
Only the town, nigga
Eh man quit hogging up the joint, man you babysitting it
What you talking about?
Pass that shit over here

[Verse 3 - Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that likes to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it
But it ain't enough on it
Fuck with the S the T, I-D-E-S
Nevertheless I'm hella fresh
Rolling joints like a cigarette
So pass it cross the table like ping-pong
I'm gone, beating my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to get another stogie
Niggas all kick in like Shinobi
Nummy ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be popping to let my friend hit shit
Unless you pull out the phat crispy
5 dollar bill on the real before its history
Cause niggas be having them vacuum lungs
An if you let em hit it for free
You hella dum-da-dum-dum!
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the dick-teasers
Skeezers and weirdos
That be fuckin' off the land like "Where tha bomb at?"
Give me 2 bucks, you take a puff and pass my bomb back
Suck up the dank like a Slurpee
The serious bomb will make a nigga go delirious like Eddie Murphy
I got more Growing Pains than Maggie
Cause niggas nag me
To take the dank out of the baggie
