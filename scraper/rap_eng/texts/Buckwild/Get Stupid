[Verse 1 - Celph Titled]
Meet my [Pooh??] with a chain slang and spit raw
You's a poodle that can't hang with the big dogs
And ain't no other rapper worthy
I'll shoot a cap through your derby
Laminate your motherfuckin' head, save it for taxidermy (bitch)
You said you got your own clothing line
But that was just wire strung up in your backyard
For your clothes to dry
*I'm in the club with your bitch* getting a back rub
Plus I've put a trapdoor on the floor of your bathtub
So when it opens up you'll fly right into a river duke
I keep a piece tucked like Pizza Hut cause I deliver food
And it ain't over 'til the fat lady sucks my dick
How many Godzilla gravy verses must I kick
M6 lasers on Glock 23s
For batty boys that ride bicycles without the seats (faggots)
So I keep a poker face when I poli
And watch my plan unfold like fucked up origami

[Verse 2 - Lord Digga]
It's a new dawn from the intro
That flow when I dead all those
Friends and family and I won't lay low
(Celph Titled:And do it again when Demigodz say so ?)
Spit razor-sharp shit like T from Makos
I'm riding with the chrome like it's >??< and >ray zones??<
Make friends, I don't think so
They gone with the wind, no sequel
Ya'll sweet and low
What? You think you're equal
Sniper actuate, busting from the church steeple
Murking your people, I'm more than deceitful
I'm not peaceful, I'm spiteful
I discharge like bushmasters' military rifles
Lyrical commando, infinite ammo
HK niggas, with the pearl handle
Heavy like anvils, black Sopranos
Everything animal, have your head for my mantle
Dead you in the club, outside they burn the candles
Because...

[Verse 3 - Kwest]
For the price of general admission you have gained admittance
To witness a transmission of script that defies all description
And I hope this transaction will be to your satisfaction
No money back or being let back in once I'm in action
You're addicted, soon as my lips spitting the gift
Looks like your shit >??< to get you open or lifted
That's from >??< I imagine if you drifted it hit
Your mind's gears will shift >??< and dripped
Smacking your senses senseless with inventive type of sentence
This burns like incense, makes no sense inside of defenses
My mental friendship to governments to discover its agenda
The intelligence will skim and then mark return to sender
This is energy in its truest form
Hip hop in its human form
Often spoken of but never seen like a unicorn
Fact is when you order >catfish??< I'll >??< intergalactic
Voice is over your head twice like >??< with prophylactics
