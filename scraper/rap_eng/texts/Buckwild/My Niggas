[Verse 1]
Yes, I love my niggas
Ballers, thoroughbreds, drug dealers
Bosses, goons, bidders, cold killers
Them stay strapped silverback gorillas
Yeah, they all my niggas
R.I.P. B.I.G., Nas, Jigga
U-God, Ghost, Rae, my nigga RZA
Big L, Pun, Pac, niggas miss ya...
Shit, I reps for my niggas
I ice pick a nigga neck for my niggas
No regrets to the death for my niggas
Fly niggas
West coast, NY niggas
South niggas, even my educated house niggas
Clout niggas, this shit is about figures
Black duffle, wrist wear it attract trouble
How to trap, bubble
Gotta keep that MAC muffled
Don't act puzzled, for a plate oaths'll break
No codes, crossroads, them expose chose they fate
Awake, up late, Welch's grape and CÎROC
In a cranberry BM, circulatin' the block
You know certain niggas stay perpetratin' for props
'Til you put hands on 'em
Or have ya mans and 'em blam on 'em
In broad day 'til the beef sautéed
Examples, bein' made'll make a nigga more afraid...

[Verse 2]
With no scope could poke holes through ya meat loaf
It's no joke could pop the toast off a ski slope
Blowin' smoke, crushin' the 'dro up in a C-note
Polo pea coat, too for dolo to be broke
Gotta feel us niggas
Show respect or either kill us, niggas
Drug dealers, thoroughbreds and bidders
Body snatchers, silverback gorillas
Y'all all my niggas
All my life I done poured out liquors
Spit scriptures, my shit is the sickest
Got old pictures of me to show what the mix is
Money mayhem, magnum bottles of Moë
That cocked gold plated 40 Glock gets holy
On any block hip-hop rocks I'm cozy
From the moss to them cell blocks, they know me...

[Verse 3]
Dope boy me, dope boy Z
From the '90s in BK, blew the OT
Ounce of soufflé, whipped the whole key
Pound of pure yay flipped, I'm cozy
Custies OD, drugs was trophies
Chicks was hand picked, wrist was Rollie
Mr. low key from the bottomless pit
Ghetto life, grew up on some Guantanamo shit
Dominoes quip, pot mix, envelopes lick
Cops, slip, get lock bitch, I don't know shit
Honor no snitch, the seed of a poisonous breed
Believe to be conceived through soulless greed
Never free, trapped, been to hell and back
Been jail, been bailed, still well intact
Harpels, been in Gucci, Chanel in Saks
The car rails or the cartel, tell 'em that

[Outro]
Real nigga season has begun
For all my real niggas
I rep for you, I rap for you, I ride for you
Ghetto to ghetto, city to city
Hood to hood, I salute.. my niggas
