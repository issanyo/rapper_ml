[Intro]
Yeah, oh that's much better, that's much better
Pinnacle pinnacle pinnacle
Yah, yeah

[Verse 1]
This been that shit that I was talking bout since '95
I want those Gaga numbers, y'all just tryna feel the hype
You're not my competition
Stop pretending, stop the tennis
Fuck with all that back and forth
I move with poise I see your tension
I see your feed and mentions
I see you need attention
I pay no mind to that cause time is money
And wasting my sense banking on you to get through the pressure's a mean investment
You talk so smooth when it's time to work never see the effort
I got no problem cutting ties off
Duck and ride off
I'm running game go check the bylaws
Set the bar high
I'm on a high board, dive
Feel like a cyborg, I
Still got my eyes close, high
Up in the sky more, ride
I cut the game with a sick precision with scissors
I snip my umbilical running straight out the womb to give 'em that I make sure that everything remains raw
Y'all just talk, everything remains blah
My dogs off of the leash
These broads offer their cars, catch feelings and they offer the lease
All for the love of the game are you fucking insane?
Tryna give my squad a mansion 'for they take 'em away, damn

[Hook]
My life's been running all these days gone away
That don't say much oh no no
That don't say much oh no no no
I can't help my sinning I'm a sinner
Save my soul, save my soul
Lord save my soul
Can you save my soul

[Verse 2]
I don't trust all the chitter chatter we dribble past you
Why you guard yourself?
Always caught in the wrong circle get lost in the sauce heard you've been buying your own batch
Thinking you'll get it cracking by lighting your own match, uh
Was back in Chapman was rapping jacking for beats, hitting practice at 5AM up till one and sometimes three
Tryna' burn it on both ends but was watching it burn me
Watching them all watching like when will he fall see like
My girl told me "uh fuck it we good"
Untouchable must've been running misunderstood
Knew there was something telling me jump and knew that I could, but I couldn't get away long enough to jump in for good
I've seen a lot of people fall and a lot of them pass
A lot of them shot themselves in the foot when the gas was at half empty and that envy that's sending you back setting your clock to a whole nother rhythm must've been bad I mean
I went from rapping in vacant basements to rapping in front of faces amazing to see me rapping on stages
And changing my escalation making accountable statements, the statements in my account looking great I'm loving the changes ahh

[Hook]
My life's been running all these days gone away
That don't say much oh no no
That don't say much oh no no no
I can't help my sinning I'm a sinner
Save my soul, save my soul
Lord save my soul
Can you save my soul
