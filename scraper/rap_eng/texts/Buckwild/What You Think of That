[Intro: Memphis Bleek]
That's right, Up front and personal

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]
Where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at?
I love these streets, what you think of that?
My whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats
I'ma ball 'til I fall what you think of that?
What you think of that? What you think of that?
I'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that?
Where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at?
I love these streets, what you think of that?
My whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats
I'ma ball 'til I fall what you think of that?
What you think of that? What you think of that?
I'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that?

[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
Yo, light the trees up, my hoes, D cupped, G's up
Memph Bleek, nigga, what?!?
Ride shotgun in the range
Bitches pay the price for thangs, rock ice and chains
Yo they change under the weather, it got a little cold, too iced out
You can hardly see the gold
That's the way a nigga rock now, don't stop now
Still on the block now, shorty, hold the Glock down
Only things changed, the bitches I pressed
The way they fit in the dress
Like 'em big in the breasts
Shoes gotta be the shit, don't walk in kicks
Yo you rollin' with the Memph, twitch the dutch and split
Break the fuck out, bang, back a truck out
Often see the rims these bitches'll bug out
You know what though?
I don't give a fuck though, Still in the cut, let the .44 blow

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]
Where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at?
I love these streets, what you think of that?
My whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats
I'ma ball 'til I fall what you think of that?
What you think of that? What you think of that?
I'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that?
Where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at?
I love these streets, what you think of that?
My whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats
I'ma ball 'til I fall what you think of that?
What you think of that? What you think of that?
I'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that?

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
Yo, it's all about a brick kid, gettin' bent kid, slide wit a chick kid
Where the Benz kid? Creep on it, make cats sleep on it
You know what your song lack, Bleek on it
It's straight for stacks, where you hatin' cats
World premier type broad, I'ma make you that, stay shapin that
Yeah, make a stack, show them niggas where they girls be fakin that
What you think of THAT? Where my niggas at?
We all around the streets where them figures at
New Acc, put the top down, nigga, crack sold out now
Where it's at? Ball out now, straight to the morgue, play? Yo we ball
Y'all gon hate till I fall so I spray till I'm gone
Gotta push the coupe and do what he do
I ride in the truck, I'm high nigga, wha?

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]
Where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at?
I love these streets, what you think of that?
My whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats
I'ma ball 'til I fall what you think of that?
What you think of that? What you think of that?
I'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that?
Where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at?
I love these streets, what you think of that?
My whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats (Uh)
I'ma ball 'til I fall what you think of that?
What you think of that? What you think of that? (Uh Oh)
I'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that? (Uh Oh)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Know niggas ain't frontin like I'm a clown or sumthin
Like I don't get down or sumthin
Like I don't tote a 4 pound of sumthin
Round here frontin like my shit don't sound like nuttin
Like I ain't got the crown or suttin
Like I ain't the nigga you base ya life on
I guess I ain't the reason you got that ice on
Like I ain't the muthafuckin dude wit the shoes
I guess I ain't the reason you rhyme the way you do
Like I ain't the nigga who mastered all flows
And the reason they can't sell them four point O's
Like I ain't 5 mill, and what do ya joint go?
Excuse me? Nigga don't confuse me
I ain't one of you rappers who got a deal
I'm one of the few niggas spittin it and got it for real
And even if you hatin, you gotta knock it in yo wheels
And the day that I stop it.....ILL!!

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]
Where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at?
I love these streets, what you think of that?
My whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats
I'ma ball 'til I fall what you think of that?
What you think of that? What you think of that?
I'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that?
Where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at?
I love these streets, what you think of that?
My whole team rock rocks, we don't speak to cats
I'ma ball 'til I fall what you think of that?
What you think of that? What you think of that?
I'm a real ass nigga, what you think of that?
