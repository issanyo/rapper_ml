[Intro]
Let me know if y'all ever heard anybody talk like this
I'll wait... that's what I thought, hold up
Let me paint, let me paint
Let me paint these pictures

[Verse]
I'm often holdin' my tongue when these niggas get celebrated
Never lie to the public and told them I never hated
I'm still looked upon as a Gretsky who never skated
The Favre that was never traded, the Jordan who never made it
It's more than a revelation
It's more than a kid shootin' that ball into a milk crate
Cocksucker, I'm still great
I'm Earl Manigault to them niggas who sellin' dope
Dollars on the top of backboards, killers and crack lords
Bitches claimin' they friend's daughter caught up in tax fraud
I'm from the bottom, what more can you fuckin' ask for?
Down for whatever but still evadin' those trap doors
Evaluatin' those same money angles that Mack saw
Huh, I think that deserves a hats off
I stick to my Roots but still I'm havin' these Black Thoughts
Visions of a young boy bleedin' out on his back porch
Screamin' to his momma and prayin them niggas back off
Pardon me, I'm Cole Sear with a cold beer
Hard for me to be so feared when the flow's rare
Harmony when there's no snare it be so clear
So by the time you say I'm the greatest, nigga, they won't care
I'm so artistic I'm autistic
Bars cryptic like scripts that was written by archbishops
A generational tale that you all missed it
To amused by these coon ass rappers and lost bitches
Listen, I'm not too relatable that's debatable
I speak for old killers and niggas who wouldn't play with you
Brothers that'll prey on a nigga but still'll pray for you
Down state, make sure you ate, but take a trey or two
Huh, it ain't broken, it just the breaks for you
Man if I changed, nigga, it ain't too late for you
My brother Born said, "nigga, don't mope about it
Best things you do in life, most people won't know about it"
Bro I doubt it, it's God in the flesh, sparrin' the best
Plant seeds between weeds and these gardens of death, yes
These niggas talkin' but I ain't hearin' 'em
Jumble a bunch of words and y'all already comparin' 'em
But these vocals'll put the fear in 'em
Niggas claimin' the throne when y'all had nothin' but cheers for 'em
Yeah, my vocals'll put the fear in 'em
Niggas claimin' they God, let's see when the Devil stares at 'em

[Outro]
I be talkin', man
