[Verse 1 – AG Da Coroner]
Little nigga this be my art
Most of these niggas steal from the bigger guys
Choose your religion, I’m breaking bread in the synagogue
Everybody line up, your time up, go find a recliner
Laid back as I’m murdering these vaginas
Early morning in the diner with the egg whites
Butter on the bread light, if it still don’t hit you I bet the lead might
Uncle doing fed time, I still celebrate
With a glass of that red wine, step in the booth and bless mine
I know god watching over me
Send niggas to hit your moms in her ovaries
For these faggots thinking they knowing me
Take a trip to the church, pour water on your rosaries
Believe what I got up my sleeve will make you freeze and plead
You looking nervous while you drop to your knees, please
I’m the real meaning of a rap artist, blood stains on your man’s carpet

[Verse 2 – Meyhem Lauren]
If it’s sawfish we eat pasta with the bassa
Keep these bitches praying like we’re knocka sipping vodka
I’m a doctor, no stethoscope
Precious coke, freshest dope
I rock a leather coat while looking for a better quote
Never wrote, shit I ain’t about these streets
Certified, murder time, now you mortified, I make a burner rise
Open up your chest and take a breath, these bullets burglarize
Surgeon sized salary, beast of the galaxy
[?] struggles, skywalk on air bubbles
Niggas act stingy with wealth but share troubles
They can keep that, bout to relocate to where the beach at
Fuck the jacket and the winter I be poolside for dinner
Out of town, chilling with friends like David Schwimmer
Well built, covered in silk, I’m looking slimmer
Lay with dimes handcrafted by the palms of perfection
What you see is what you get, this life is all about perception

[Hook]
Welcome to the great outdoors, peace to the wilderness
Started from the ground up, peep how we’re building this
Shine bright, grind right, rhyme tight, now we in the limelight
Ow! Outdoorsman in the building, what, Ow!
Ow! Outdoorsman in the building, what, Ow!
Niggas is skilled at this, welcome to the great outdoors, peace to the wilderness

[Verse 3 – Meyhem Lauren]
Across the pond we got your nieces on our bits and pieces
A bitter feast that increases, we’re sipping [?], jeesus
Fuck swiping fees, that’s for skeezers, they try to bleed us
They feed us and then secede us, and wish we give em a fetus
I’m on my old school shit, rocking Adidas
Face covered by [?], straight in dialogue with Midas
Recreational mischief had us wyling, holding heaters
Keep the views of nonbelievers tightly tucked behind my sneakers
Fuck em, stepped on by thousand dollar gym shoes
Buckwild, talk of the town, my niggas been news
It’s still [?] penmanship, gave birth to your whole style but then I ended it
[?] you my IQ is GQ
I control the drugs, you let the drugs control you
Shit, we cut from a different cloth
You run from niggas, I run with niggas that’s pitching soft

[Hook]
