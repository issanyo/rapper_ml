I’m here
To make mad moves, I won’t pop
On the planet to drop jewels, I won’t pop, interpretating
Pain into news, giving
O.C. point of views, yo.  Check me out

[Verse 1: O.C.]
Now
My mind is a threat that pulls you like a gun
I either gon’ stand and fight or just run
Once battled for undisputed, I never pursued it
The ones who pursued it got suited-up fuses
Now one dies, replaced by his fetus born
Devoted to hip hop, you could quote that I’m sworn
Picking logic on the topic, for the object is to vibe it
I’ll make sure thoughts are pure and sense go inside it
Lights is shining through about time, one, two
Hard work, demise, excellence overdue.  More than
Decent, my descents is Portuguese and
Pops put me up on it, like, less than recent
“[?]” is carved in my gut.  I got
Powerplays to pick from, so, like I said

[Hook: O.C.]
I’m here
To make mad moves, I won’t pop
On the planet to drop jewels, I won’t pop, interpretating
Pain into news, giving
O.C. point of views.  Yo, I’m here
To make mad moves, I won’t pop
On the planet to drop jewels, I won’t pop, interpretating
Pain into news, giving
O.C. point of views.  Ah, check it out

[Verse 2: O.C.]
Shake a leg, you’re fake while your concepts beg to be
Heard.  NED to wino, fed you what he said
Decided to take in all the gimmicky, (drunk imagery)
Trigger.  Drinking Hennessy psyched you up with energy
Think not, sucker.  Stop, look, examine
I kick realities far beyond a cannon
I coast the mic, I might boast but never bite.  My
Physics with lyrics pose a mad scientist
My ethics aren’t synthetic, quite pure
They cure thoughts from Cali to the Eastern shores
O.C.-double-E master, I conquer pace, plus I
Figure my mind is trapped beyond time and space
Don’t waste time, won’t write a rhyme in haste—they gotta
Fit like my foot—size eight—and, like I said

[Hook: O.C.]
I’m here
To make mad moves, I won’t pop
On the planet to drop jewels, I won’t pop, interpretating
Pain into news, giving
O.C. point of views.  Yo, I’m here
To make mad moves, I won’t pop
On the planet to drop jewels, I won’t pop, interpretating
Pain into news, giving
O.C. point of views.  Check it out

[Verse 3: O.C.]
Whether either/or how well, you’ll rock well, whether
Behind bars or dead, my spirit’ll still dwell in
The eyes of the wise, I size up to par
Plus shine potential from the twilight of a star
So who says the North is soft?  I could coffin
A rhyme, come back on time, and still get off
No smokescreen could blind me on account of my crystal, I
Whistle through the air like the stray of a pistol shot
Listen up.  I’m here and I’m official, a metaphysical
Being worth seeing—soon, you’ll be agreeing
I’ll throb your pulmonary, adversaries get sweaty palms
Ain’t ready for the mic unless clapping off the arms, so I
Just stick with the crew and taking mine after ours ‘cause
My purpose on the mic is to defeat all the frauds

[Hook: O.C.]
And making
Making mad moves, I won’t pop
On the planet to drop jewels, I won’t pop, interpretating
Pain into news, giving
O.C. point of views.  Yo, I’m here
To make mad moves, I won’t pop
On the planet to drop jewels, I won’t pop, interpretating
Pain into news, giving

To make mad moves, I won’t pop
On the planet to drop jewels, I won’t pop, interpretating
Pain into news, giving
