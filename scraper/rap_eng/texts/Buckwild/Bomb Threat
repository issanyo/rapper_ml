(Hook)
Checkin' my style, return to zero
Checkin' my style, return to zero
Checkin' my style, return to zero
Got zeros checkin' my style
Checkin' my style, get gunned up and clapped quick
Zeros get gunned up and clapped quick
Checkin' my style get gunned up and clapped quick
Typical ignorant rap shit

(Verse 1: Johnny Napalm)
Explosive, Napalm dropping off
With a waterfall full of tomahawks
Put them into ya, like the Taj Mahal
Leave them with obituaries and a monologue
I'm critically acclaimed, and lyrically insane
Flow through the conscious, get the feeling in ya brain
All in your head, rearrange your cortex
Stay in your lane, strain on the brakes then floor it
Oughta leave the streets, don't speak your piece
Throw frags at them, backtracking through the frequency
Easily a deity in the modern day
But really, a legend like Dr. Dre
Nasir, Big Poppa, Lamont, and Jay
All my congregates, before and after
Immortal rapper born to dominate
Only built for Cuban links, some rocks, and chains
Not today, I'm built for a purpose
The skills in my verses, can put real niggas in the hearse
And fuck mass appeal to suburban
I'm a lyrical machine concealed as a person
To bust a rhyme, yelling "fuck a nine
To five," At fourteen, I'm above your time
This luck of mine is not for the faint of heart
Who's your top 1, nigga, name me off

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Johnny Napalm)
Might get your wig pushed back tonight
Meet your afterlife when I attack the mic
Scrap and fight MC's with a tactical knife
Destroy all rappers in sight, better grab for a rife
Take this L when you get boxed in the ring
I'm the prodigy of Nas and Rakim
But probably, the coming of the God MC
Drop and cease, land on the side of me
Lock and squeeze, put 5 in your chest
9 and the Wes', then he died on the steps, 2
My 16's like a lethal weapon
Heat seek selection, screaming bring the rest in
Enter 36 chambers of elimination
Endangered, doomsday's been initiated
Sinister ancient flows, and mission statements
Status: Napalm started shifting, shaping
To a griffin, dragon, destroy the masses
Wait a minute, make them listen
Won't be in celebration when I hoist your casket
Deploying fragments of my voice in static
Not yet, keep these in your conscience
Drop knowledge like the second Mohammed
Lyrical prophet, protect ya neck
When I flex, best expect it's a bomb threat

(Hook) X2
