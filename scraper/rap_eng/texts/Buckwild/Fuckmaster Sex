[Feat. Funkmaster Flex]

[Talking Intro Sample:]
"Coochie... mmmm, cooch. Okay! "

[Intro Sample Loop: x4]
"Young ladies if ya ready say, yeahhh (yeahhh!) ya don't stop
Fly guys if ya ready say, hooooo! (hooooo!) ya don't stop"

[Talking Intro Sample:]
"Ah, well let's... let's do it, let's do it
Hit the bomb, man
Rare form tonight... RARE FORM TONIGHT! "

[Talk Intro:]
Yeeeahhh, it's goin' down y'all
Fuckmaster Sex
Hide your bitch
It's the new age Wilt Chamberlain
Ain't playin' games, my friend...

[Verse Intro Sample:]
("Ayo tell 'em what your name is... ")
[Verse 1:]
Celph Titled, also known as Fuckmaster Sex, I
Do a slut in my car seat, show her my sex drive
Didn't soak the carpet, but she had a wet rug
Pulled out on those almond-colored breasts and left a chestnut
Better believe she gave me dome
Cause if not she was gettin' (thrown) on the side of the road like a safety (cone)
No wide body Benz, I need a wide body bitch
With an ass so large it take up the space of a 3 car garage
Had a second coming when I busted a nut twice
With a Mariah Carey look-a-like but with hair like Scary Spice
She was the type that as soon as she say hi
She's takin' off her clothes and askin' ("Baby, where's the KY? ")
Huh, got a marriage that she's not holy embraced in
Cause on her body there ain't a single hole that's sacred
(Oh yeah I taped it) so I can see all of it
Then it's goin' straight to DVD like a new Steven Segal flick

[Singing Hook: x3]
La, la-la-la, la-la, la-la
[Vocal Scratch]
"60 minutes of fuckin', call me Fuckmaster Sex, bitch"

[Verse 2:]
Got a groupie on my jock and she want me to bang it raw
The tramp is a skank and whore, she'll give you a canker sore
She give up ass often
And it wasn't a MySpace timestamp, that she had the last log-in
Not an assumption and it ain't complicated man
Cause she gon' blow either way like an oscillating fan
I'm like James Bond in a tricked out Viper
And you're just Pierce Brosnan in Mrs. Doubtfire
Yeahhh, I am Fuckmaster Sex, no split personalities here
I'll go from pimpin' to being weird like Outkast's career
Bitch I stick the fork in it and won't spoon later
They will find the stains on Room Raiders
I'm in the kitchen with a Ruben Studdard ruben cutter
Abuse ya mother, won't use a rubber
The damn bitch like a sandwich, all stuffed and greasy
Bust a nut in the hoagie and create a new sub-species

[Singing Hook: x3]
La, la-la-la, la-la, la-la
[Vocal Scratch]
"60 minutes of fuckin', call me Fuckmaster Sex, bitch"

[Talking Outro Sample:]
"I'm in the 90's strong! I'm not in the 90's on some MTV videos or some VH1 nonsense!
I did not come up here to play Hammer and Young MC!
< It's not what it is... That's not what represents the 90's to me, okay?! "

"Nobody should have their daughter around you, fam
You are ridiculous, you need help and you should seek help
And people embracin' this dude needs to think about it and think what he's doin'...
And I blame myself and everybody else for not speakin' up and givin' their opinion on
What we think he is and what you ARE."
