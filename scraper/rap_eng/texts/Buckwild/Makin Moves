[Hook 2X: Mic Geronimo + Royal Flush]
It go one for all my people in the pen doing time
Two for niggas that was forced to do a life of livin crime
If you gotta do, whatever, just to keep a little cheddar
(Make your moves y'all, Make your moves y'all)

[Royal Flush]
I'm going through the levels of hell, where life get tooken by a drug sale
Weigh ya grams on ya scale, holdin block for real
Shootin niggas out to kill, savin money for bail
While the tecs make ya squeal, beat you down 'till you heal
It's a struggle motherfucker, when you walk with your steel
While the baseheads lookin' for someone that deal
While my man Ryan died trying to eat his last meal
Seen it come and go, many succeed, but some bleed
Goin' day by day, carrying works like a disease
Do you get the picture, the basic fact, why we strapped?
Why little kids get kidnapped, and cars get jacked
Praying to a man that could never help you wit that
I'm on the road to the riches, bitches countin my stack
Keep the red eyes, and shootin bullets back to back
Hypnotized, smokin lye, sometime it feels like crack
I gotta get mines, you gotta get yours, by all accords

[Hook 2X]

[Royal Flush]
That's why I sit back and smoke my reefer
Listen what the Gods teach
Fuck a preacher, holdin gun's a creature
Streets make it hard to survive, so most die
Some niggas is paralyzed, catchin slugs in they spine
Due to mankind, holdin my nine, commitin' crimes
Sometime my mind relax, leave the block then come back
It's all infested with cracks and little kids packin' gat
Bitches fuckin for stacks, New York is wild like that
Perhaps you got an open case judge in your face
Sister made a mistake, got you layin upstate
5 to 15, holdin' your ox from gettin wopped
While somebody else fuckin ya girl right on ya block
(Rock - cause it never stop)
Niggas bustin that cops for props
These streets is hot, sawed-off shotguns and weed spots
Snitches that eavesdrop, first of all started hard rocks
Stealing outta car lots, now they talk non-stop (Word)

[Hook 2X]

Word up, wasteland (wasteland) wasteland (wasteland)
Shit's real (wasteland)

Beat the nigga Royal Flush (now hold up - wasteland)
Get money by all means (wasteland)
Wasteland (wasteland)
Welcome to '96 (nahmean)
Buckwild (wasteland), Buckwild (waste..)
