{VERSE 1}

I'm in the basement getting wasted I'm broke, and my momma testing my patience so I'm boutta go smoke, boutta go loc, if I don't hit a lick soon, catch a nigga slipping make him front page news upon the tribune, if he want it if its money I'm on it, sucker niggas and my opponents get hit up if they flaunt it, it's temporary man its just for the moment, something to jump, in a slump I been kicking the same shit for months

Freddie Gibbs - "what up doe"

I ran into Lil Jo in "?" heard he been hurting and working serving that yayo

Freddie Gibbs - "Say bruh heard you getting cheddar with the chrome let yo dawg hold a couple of them soon, my pockets flat I'm barely keeping gas in the LTD, and making moves around the G keep the tank on E"

Lil Jo - "but Lil Gibbs I can't fuck with you man, you full of drama, plus you threw away my chopper + you owe me some change"

Freddie Gibbs - "Man you trippin on the fuck ass highpoint?
I got some new shit dawg the P95 joint, the 40 cali smith & wesson, I can sell em but I need them later, I'll hit you with some paper, get my weight up and return the favor"

Lil Jo - "yo I ain't holding no work but I know a couple niggas you can jerk if wiling to the dirt, but you could get murked these niggas known for clapping"

Freddie Gibbs - "Man I'll put them bastards on the meat waggon"


{CHORUS}

Man they fucking with the wrong one, fuck beefs fuck crews, I'll show you niggas how I move, yo they fucking with the wrong one, no mercy no love, bussing slugs at you homo thugs, these niggas fucking with the wrong one, ain't no telling what Imma do to you I'll pop and send a nigga to his funeral, look they're fucking with the wrong one, cause if you got it I'll take it, I bring  the drama, fuck the stunting and faking, these niggas fucking with the wrong one

Drums cut out for scene of dialogue, however the synth pads and melodic piano remains
{Dialogue}

Freddie Gibbs - "for real man a nigga hurting man

Lil Jo - (chuckles)

Freddie Gibbs - "Straight up ain't no gigs hiring"

Lil Jo - "Yeah" (cuts him off)

Freddie Gibbs - "Ain't no money out here in the G nigga"

Lil Jo - "Yeah Nigga I know, I know nigga"

Freddie Gibbs - "shit I don't give a fuck, I'm down to do whatever nigga, lemme know what I gotta do nigga straight up"

Lil Jo - "Aight"


Drums come back in
{Verse 2}

See Lil Jo wasn't moving huge blow but he was copping from some Mexicanos in east Chicago, probably get a key in a month, quater a week he could've fronted me with something let a young boy eat but Imma take it how it come to me and get it how I live it, the hollows from the "?" will knock the logo off your fitted

Freddie Gibbs - Is you bullshiting

Lil Jo - "Naw nigga it's all real, all you gotta do is show up and do it"

Freddie Gibbs - "So whats the deal"

Lil Jo - "My connect been fucking me and my numbers through the roof, this my last fucking with dude I'm losing loot so tomorrow Imma send a bitch to cop my coke, you stick em and give me half the "?" money and give me the dope"

Freddie Gibbs - "This shit to good to be true"

Lil Jo - "Is you scared?"

Freddie Gibbs - "Is you crazy, I'll murder everything in the room women and babies, no witnesses, no weapon they ain't got no case, man I don't even need a mask they don't know my face"

So the next day I meet the bitch and follow her, hopped into a steamer I borrowed from my uncle Oliver, homie was trippin I would have never put my trust in a hoe, I gave that bitch like 30 seconds then I bussed in the door like blow (machine gun rinsing noise) nobody move or somebodies getting wet up, a room full of cats with gats this was a set up, a vado from the side stabbed me in the eye, partially blinded from the blood but I let shots fly, I backed out the crib, ducking and running, niggas was juming, heart pumping, body numbing from my adrenaline rushing. Imma see this nigga Jo and confront him, make that snake ass nigga pray the price for stunting nigga it's nothing


Drum cuts again for more dialogue
{Dialogue}

Freddie Gibbs - "Ole bitch ass nigga here, ayy nigga go right there nigga" (talking to himself)

Freddie Gibbs - "ayy fam"

Lil Jo - "What"

Freddie Gibbs - "bitch I got that shit for you for you nigga"

Lil Jo - "I don't know what your talking bout"

Freddie Gibbs - "Yeah you know what I'm talking bout mothafucka"
(Gunshots disperse)

{Chorus}

Man they fucking with the wrong one, fuck beefs fuck crews, I'll show you niggas how I move, yo they fucking with the wrong one, no mercy no love, bussing slugs at you homo thugs, these niggas fucking with the wrong one, ain't no telling what Imma do to you I'll pop and send a nigga to his funeral, look they're fucking with the wrong one, cause if you got it I'll take it, I bring  the drama, fuck the stunting and faking, these niggas fucking with the wrong one
