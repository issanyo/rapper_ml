[Intro: Kool DJ Red Alert]
Ok we gonna straighten this shit out right now ok!
Hey I go by the name of the Kool the DJ Red Alert!
OK!!!!!!!!! I got a mean lineup
I got my man Cormega, Parrish Smith, Grand Puba, KRS-One, and the Big Daddy Kane!!!
And it's goin down like thiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Verse 1: Cormega]
If you could dream it, you could be it
I once idolized a few guys I superseded
As you near, you hear Anita Baker playin in my BM
Indeed, I'm from the era of Patrick Ewing Adidas
The game turned public housing to areans
Bummy dudes move packs so they could buy jewels and sneakers
Money grew, some adapted, others would become distracted
Smokin woolies, openin they packs like Pookie
I'm a fiend of hip-hop, my rap is cinematic
The beat is the plot, I'm breed as a clock
G's like R-P, believe it or not
Prestige is an illusion
That it lose you, and you not hot..
You know how I do
My jewels so colorful, my daughter don't gotta watch cartoons
Dudes watch my moves, like Lebron fresh out of high school
My electrifyin skills unrivaled

[Verse 2: Parrish Smith from EPMD]
I'm an all star baby pa, Alot of dudes is lost in the rap game chasin life of the rap star
Not P, I paid my dues while you hate and snooze
P always come correct no singin the blues
Hip Hop's my life, P already paid the price
Give me the mic and the vocal booth and y'all could keep the ice
And I still run on the young ones like Jerry Rice
And if you can't see in the dark then homey turn on the lights
And if a sucker don't like P, the feelin is mutual
Tune my rhyme into a RPM then shift to neutral
Every move is crucial, catch PMD comin through the hood
In the new SUV, with the chrome shoes
From the L.I.E. TO QB
It's Mega and P two of the nicest reppin N.Y.C
Parrish Smith you know me well from EPMD
So You Gots To Chill cause niggas can't fuck me

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
Uh, you know I got the shine when it's time to get mine
Pop that ass with a classic-ass line (uh!)
You try to step to me, I'm worse than landmines
Twist yo' spine like spiral book rhymes
You wanna do this, you must be out yo' mind
Pop shut it down, so I'm one of a kind
Get mine, fall back and recline
If you look up, BAD MUH'FUCKER and that's me you gon' find
Grand Puba, I can never suck
That's like tryin to ride around with single-digit rim on the Caddy truck
Me in this addin up, all it equals
Is another hot joint that I spit wit my peoples
So, you know the deal, real recognize real
So throw yo' hands up, let me know how you feelS
Cause it's on now (it's on now), stack paper, like a green mile
Official authentic is Grand Puba style

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
Here we go KRS in the spot
When I spit it you can see that I am fresh they are not
This that other type of lyric when you hear it you stop
KRS and Cormega now that's some real hip hop
I'm glad to see these MC's comin up after me
Runnin up after me, doin it how it has to be
This that new shit but it's old
This that hot shit but it's cold
Three, four, five clips when we roll
Boom boom bop bip when you fold
B-R-O-N-X PAY THE TOLL
They standin next to the flesh I'm next to the soul
My history is too complex whenever it's told
One of a kind breakin the mold
Refine in the mind rebuilt in the soul
Health, love and awareness and wealth now that's the goal
Pass the pole of the microphone that you hold
I model my role with my pocket so swole
Don't have to be told twice, KRS and Cormega, yo them cats too nice (HA!!!)
Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang!!!!
When it comes to lyrics yo them cats can't hang
Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang
KRS And Cormega!!!!!

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Aiyyo, back up and let a real Don through
To show you who this motherfuckin spot belong to
So many talkin like there's somethin that they wan' do
Shit, y'all niggas couldn't find the heart with John Q
I'm here to warn you, just might show off because
I could really "clap" and make the lights go off
My Enterprise like Microsoft, the sweat and blood'll cool
Make cheddar double through, plus I'm ghetto lovable
Scheme to win by any means within
Shit, a nigga this here thorough won't be seen again
Cause when my, team is in and I got green to spend
Or I'mma hold the fort down just like supreme di-vine
Got you stuck behind enemy lines, the whole vicinity's mine
And he decline, nigga give me a sign
And you don't want ventilation all up out your house
Then treat my name like spoiled food, keep it out yo' mouth - nigga!

[Outro: Kool DJ Red Alert]
And there you have it, everybody!
Big up to everybody all across the border that understand REAL Hip Hop
REAL skills, REAL lyrics
I go by the name the Kool the DJ Red Alert
Hey - we ain't goin a GODDAMN place!
Hey, you must think we goin somewhere
Hey, you must be out yo' goddamn MIND
AND YA PUNK, TOO!
And for all you bitches, thank you for nothin
Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!!!!!!
