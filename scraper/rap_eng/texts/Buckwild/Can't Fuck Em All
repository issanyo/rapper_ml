[Hook]
I can’t fuck em all, I can’t fuck em all
Had to let a couple go, I can’t fuck em all
Another day, another show, another chick to call
I had to let a couple go, I can’t fuck em all
I can’t fuck em all, I can’t fuck em all
Had to let a couple go, I can’t fuck em all
I’m sorry I left, but it was way too many ladies to check
I had to bounce

[Verse 1]
Yo ma, don’t take it personal
I stole your heart, you probably wish I took your purse from you
I used to show up to the crib and make it burst for you
I never lied and said that I would give the earth to you
Look for you, I search for you
Hold you down and nurture you, none of that shit
I would light you up a sour then I hit you again
Hit it right for bout an hour, take a shower, then split
I’m a hustler so I’d rather bag a brick than a chick
Queens niggas ain’t no good, feel like a champion because I’m so hood
Leave em sleeping like an Ambien, my flow good
I love a chick, especially when she can blow wood
Fuck, then it’s on to the next, and another and another
I even fucked a bitch that was DT undercover
Jewels on, looking like Slick Rick
Each day I’m making a new pick, laurenovic

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I like em light skinned, dark skinned
Black, white, Dominican
Looking out the window, thinking shit I’m bout to win again
Colombians and Puerto Ricans, she’s from Trinidad
Father of this fly shit, shawty I been a dad
Uh, can’t front, I want em badly
Arab chicks eating humus must give you a fatty
Plus y’all look right, so do the jew chicks
Every time I touch down, fuck her with new chips
P O L O dress code, rocking some new kicks
Trap life or rap life, most of my crew spits
Americanized Asians, mixed with Caucasians
Had a couple Scandinavians up in the day’s inn
My bad, I had Indians there
Y’all niggas only fuck with chicks with Indian hair
Shit, it’s like I been around the world
Matter fact, real talk, I probably been around your girl
