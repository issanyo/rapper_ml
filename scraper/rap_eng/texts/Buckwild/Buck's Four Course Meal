[Intro]
(It's nineteen ninety now and there's certain individuals
Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle)

October 26
It's Nineteen Ninety Now, motherfuckers

[Verse 1]
So here I am, in the spot you probably wish you was
It's a few haters, but damn if I ain't getting love
You see my fan base, you see them quoting bars
You see them bringing up my name saying "He goin' hard"
He took some time to make an album
Now he's back in effect and motherfuckers wanna out him
A lot of rappers got my face on they dart board
But they don't start war cause I'm the hardest of the hardcore
Tin-man don't need foil, metallic, exo-skeleton when heat boils
Leave you in the sun till your meat spoils
The beat boils, Buckwild bakes the heat rocks
While you soft though, I'm pulling back the crossbow
(And y'all know)
The game's saturated and crowded
But you don't hear us bitching, instead we did something about it
Made an album with the same ingredients as many classics known
The golden era rap fans who love echoing saxophones

[Verse 2]
A concept first of it's kind
Imagine if we combine me, with the murderous rhymes and tracks from a earlier time
(oh yeah)
In the climate of rap where heads are lost
But over here we stay focused and make exactly what we want (yes)
Buck ain't just Diggin' The Crates (nah)
He dug straight into the shoe boxes of floppy discs
And found some jewels so I can rock the shit
Shout out to James D.L. for havin' a vision of a magical wizard castin' angry spells
Aimin' these shells at the state of rap music
Trying to change the people and trying to change they view of it
The faggot art nerds will say we're not progressive
But they don't realize this album is a highly focused weapon
Cause we'll get the props and my rep will grow bigger
My name everywhere will make these hoes bitter
And any and all attempts to stop my movement
I swear to God you'll have brain damage from head contusions

[Verse 3]
So my challenge to jealous rappers and wanna-bes:
Make a record better than Ninety Now then you can talk to me
And you can talk to Buck but he ain't working with you
Cause he made an album with me stating facts that mostly dissed you
When flipping the flim flam, call yourself a big fan
But never spend a dime on the music, you'se a bitch man
So if I gotta sell crack to get rich
Well, I'm cooking up the fish scale and rock it like it's Ishmael
Either that or get my stage so mad amped up
Busting black hammers with choreographed dancers
I am the answer to every whack rappers demo song
Cause I am the fresh maker like the fucking Mentos song
October 26th a renaissance begins to work
Doin' shit so big I take one step and fall off of the Earth
We on a motherfucking murder spree
Give constructive criticism and I'll give you reconstructive surgery

[Interlude]
Yo, Buck, we gotta give 'em one more man
Throw your L's up for this one
Rest in peace Big L, yeah

[Verse 4]
Yo, listen, it don't take fear to fear us
You fuckin' with an evil spirit that don't appear in mirrors
You wouldn't want to be a fly on the wall, I'm grabbing a swatter
Swing it harder than the kick back to a Magnum Revolver
Yes I'm just awful, a God not a phony
Menage with your wife and I bought your daughter a pony
Officers know me as "That's that motherfucking guy"
Shoot a pec or a thigh, don't mean shit if you a muscle guy
My guns are more than a friend
On time at your door with a nine and a .45 at a quarter 'till ten
I seal Navy Seals, seen a whole army's intestines
And choked enemy soldiers till they had Barney's complexion
One harmless suggestion is get your speech right
My scrap napkin verses smoke what you took a week to write
You like butt cheeks tight, it ain't hard to tell
You been through more manholes than Donatello and Raphael

Faggot
