[Red Hot Lover Tone - 98 (Prod. Buckwild D.I.T.C.)]

[Intro]
HA! 98!

[Verse 1]
Yo
I'm getting reckless, reckless, if you're on my "wreck list"
Checklist, better relocate that ass to Texas-
"Chainsaw Massacre" - Tone's coming after ya
I'mma "snipe" that ass like the "57th Passenger"
Wesley (Snipes), you can't test me in my sport
I'm the King of New York, I'm deadly like, what?
"Yaheedy, that's all folks"
Tone's no joke
I'll leave ya "fucked up and broke" like the Kids from Different Strokes
(Who just took my lyrics?) I call me quick to the "hoods-uh"
My lyrics rip tracks even if I don't rhyme -
I'm
Rippin' all the wimpy, 'cause their tank is empty
My flow's on--- time like SMPTE (CLEVER, delayed delivery combined with content - INSANE) (word!)
So ... - so yeah "baby beemer"
I got the goods, to make "Victoria - sell her Secrets"
Bitches can't gas up, ni**as better pass up -
A battle with the R-E-D, I'll slice that ass up

[Hook]
Aiyyo
(Bitch) Ni**as get(tin') 98, if they come with the flat
BOY I'MMA BLOW OUT YOUR BACK (ALL)

[Verse 2]
Pressure, pressure, I'm about the pressure
Head against my Timberlands, 'cause I can get...? park avenue schmucks
When I swing this style, I ?? chumps
? many, many any of this ?
DeNiro like Robert and give you more than ?
"Demo it's a demo, like Kool G, when I rap with no problemo"
Disassemble, all my adversary in a hurry
I'm a money man ? let me pop that cherry
I kill at will, so write your will
I'm on it, you don't want none, I rip you, chill
Back up, back up, pack up, pack up
Or get smacked up
Like a stupid bitch
When they act up
No guns to shoot em up, no knives to cut up
Straight up (sound), what up?

[Hook]
(Aiyyo)
(Bitch) Ni**as get(tin') 98, if they (you) come with the flat
BOY I'MMA BLOW OUT YOUR BACK (ALL)

[Verse 3]
Sucka, sucka, sucka emcees
I'm just a rap bastard
Snatchin' all the cheese
Please
I'm about to bag yo main squeeze
She doesn't have to pray to get burns on her knees
She's, sleaze, taking all *your* G's
*Paying all my fees*, in fact she bought me ?
(Buddy!) I'mma throw the cards on the table
And catch all you "fools" like the "first day of April"
"May" I present, represent with my flow
That ass is on stage, homes, so act like you know
I got the ill style, ni**as better duck while
I get "buckwild" with that motherfucker Buckwild (word)
We're out to get the riches
Giving record company execs *98 AS IN 98 STITCHES*
Bitches, fuck a fist fight
*You get dissed right across your face if we're doing this right*

[Hook]
(Aiyyo)
(Bitch) Ni**as get(tin') 98, if they (you) come with the flat
BOY I'MMA BLOW OUT YOUR BACK (ALL)

[Outro]
(Ni**as can't fuck with me)
(hook parts until fade)
