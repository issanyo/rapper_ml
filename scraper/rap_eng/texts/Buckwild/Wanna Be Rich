Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yo, how this goin' down nine-six

(Exoticness)
Nine-six exoticness
(Representin')

Know what I mean?
(a+)
A+
(Yo, how we livin'?)
This is New York City

Ninety-seven Sosa
A to Z up in the spot representin'
Takin' it back from here it's 'sposed to be
Takin' ya back, son, take it back
Check it

Six digit trickin' Coke and Henny mixin', many listen
Fuckin' give me mine, don't wanna see no penny missin'
It's old tradition how we click and fall in position
The rap coalition, we gettin' rich an

Poetically I'm deadly like a crucifixion
Buddha addiction
Dismissin' competition when they roll with friction
My whole crew be schemin' flippy
Like ixing for that chicken

Smith brothas and A on ya Mason-Dixon
Who want the steel cap, feel the real rap
Patiently my whole crew waited and we rock premeditated
Chucked underground like the rap genie
And watch the shore by the rising tide
Now the whole world can see me

When they get foul that's when my style gets wild
I hang a man in front of a crowd without a trial
Kapow, yo that's all she wrote, end the quote
For frontin', a brotha got a dome and his legs broke

Yeah son, I want it all, your crib, cars and beepers
With hundred dollar sneakers my sounds blowin' ya speakers
Burgundy Landcruisers, chrome rims on blue Rugers
Lyrical hollow tip, slug point trugers

Yo, yo, yo, drug connects
Diamond cut bergets drippin' wet
My hole is there from Quebec, got her flippin' checks
What? I push a black Lex with gold on my neck
You rockin' with a vest tryin' to catch a hole in ya chest

Firm official, exotic girl but wanna be the ritual
Leavin' lights shine light, they've been psyched to slip through
I will abolish MC's, get straight up demolished
Yo, my mind is like a nine, I load it up with knowledge

The realism must continue, where I live is like a battlefield
We all poor but on my block is like a half a mil
Surrounded by the most criminal type of elements
Blunts, stunts, gunshots, broken-down developments

It's all illegal, young juveniles with the Desert Eagles
Street sweepers, heaters, soon-to-be retreater
It's routine, people seem to go through a cycle
So confused, to choose between the Bible or the rifle
Watch 'em stifle

Yo, me an son gon' escalate this
And get these papers run some capers
While they catch the vapors
Yeah, son, don't got no time for no chicken trickin'
It's the lyrical addiction 'cause me an' AZ be politicin'
