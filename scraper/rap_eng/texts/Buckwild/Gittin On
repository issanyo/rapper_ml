(Verse 1)
I'm on post in the Congo
In a long boat
With a river guide named John Doe
That is on blow
Got a banjo, some bongos
And a trombone
Made in Taiwan from the
Jawbone of a lawn gnome
Man, what a combo...
I've been on 'Low' since I was
Banned from Tonto & Tom Jones' condo
October of '94
Stompin' a mongrel
Raw-doggin' while rockin my poncho in Toronto
Like Doc Thompson, I'm Gonzo in the brain stem
Cuz I'm locked on, like a dog's nose to a trained scent
You do not wanna go craz yet
On the same vet
You'll end up down in your grave dead
With a caved head
If it makes dollars, it makes sense
For a gambling man of unknown stamina
Damning his own character...
Trans-Canada transit with no chance
Like a channel, they programmin' the show
Better roll cameras
I'ma put out your candle, my flow's rancor is
Rancid as those flannel pajamas of yo' grandmother's
I'm puffin' cannabis, jammin' to "Oh, Canada"
Crammin a whole handful of grams in my smoke cannister, but
"Ohh man, goddammit, he's so cagey;
Crazy as heck, zany? Well, yes/no and maybe
So presto, I change into fresh clothes
Create my own dress code: 'Canadian Retro'
Ya blame me?

(CHORUS)
Line's gittin' long
I don't give a fuck...
Rhyme-spittin, on-rhythm
I don't give a fuck...
So whatchu gittin on?
Git - gittin on?
What'chu gittin' on? Git - gittin' on??
Time tickin' on...I don't give a fuck
I am far beyond
Fuckin' out ta lunch...
So whatchu gittin on?
Git - gittin, Git - gittin' on?
Gittin' on deez muthafuckas, oh no!

(Verse 2)
I look for COMfort, but I'm COMfortable, though
I used to COMpress stress, by not
Admitting I'd COMmitted every single
COMmon sin upon the friggin' globe
I used to COMplain/come plain; now I COMe original
Rhythm in my flow
Sumthin like a tap drippin'
Monkey-in-the-middle goin' apeshit, mad trippin...
Cab sittin on the corner,meter going
Up like a boner, while I'm waitin' on Wynona
I've known her about a year or so before I boned her
Her name Wynona, cuz I Ryder - well no, I rode her
Vagina, slid up inside while she watchin' Oprah
A shock from the varying degrees, hot to colder
Police pull quarters out an okey-doke informer
Holy smokes like an organ donor wit lymphoma
Snoring like a motorboat; comatose, a goner
I telephone a homeowner I know in Oklahoma
A stoner from Kelowna couldn't mask my aroma
I spaz like a polar with a bipolar molar
Contract melanoma while boatin' in Sarasota
The odor marijuana, cells(sells) like Motorola
Rollin' oats like a bowl of granola full of Ebola
Hol' up; shoulder colder than soda like Coca-Cola
Known as a high-roller wit 3 strikes
Like a bowler
Tomato/tomato, parabola/parabola?
Baloney or bologna? I couldn't say for sure, but
The world's cold, so my soul's hooded like a cobra
I stole a solar-powered gondola without a rower
Stranded in the Atlantic alone with a can of okra
Panickin' like I'm manic, I damaged the damn rotor...
Land vanished to fantasy, dammit;
AND I'm sober
Managed to clamber ashore
Can't have been any surer
Like fans of Santana be Spanish and yellin' "Ola!"
A four-leaf clover, since Anna was Kournikova
Older than Tone Loc wit that jam in 'Ace Ventura'
Stitches for snitches rollin' over like Red Rover
Foldin' like a hand I planned in Texas Hold 'Em
Poker, what you meeean poke 'er?
I hardly know 'er
My heart colder than a capo in La Cosa Nostra
A cornucopian utopia, past the border
Half supernova-casanova and half-amoeba
I mean 'amoeba'
Quick-fast, pass it over
And that's an order from upper class
We bout to crash
Like Skywalker in swamp water with Master Yoda
A red-eyed Jedi who gets high and practice yoga
A common misnomer/misnomer
Monotone as mneumonics, but
Not iconic as odysseys like, Homer's
Moments ironic as a coroner with a boner
ET phone Home-r, Simpson
Like 'mission over'
Listen, I'm gone fishin' in Michigan
When it's open
Sittin', sippin Coronas
Pissin' up in the ocean
Spittin' like I had 'dip' inside of my lower lip
And you damn skippy I'm lammin' til October
You can't move SHIT wit no transmission or motor
Chickens flew the coop in a group
Like a school of grouper
Wit numerous new maneouvers that's proven
To smooth it over
I'm bare-white(bear white) like Rupert
Troopin' to new unkowns
With stupid duffuses...
Who approved of this hocus-pocus?
I'm as super-duper with pooperscoopers as supersoakers
Stoopin' to newer lows than anybody before
Like I'm superglued to a hula-hoop of emotion...
Moves fruitless as Rubiks Cubes when they're broken
3-by-3 - somethin' like sudoku
But it's hopeless
Toodle-doo, I'm beamin' up through the roof
A dreamer wit nickel-beavers, a litre o' Moody Blues
As keen as a new ginsu with
Deep, serated teeth
I'll keep on makin' beats go *BEEP* *BOOPITY-BOOP*
I'm deep in Fruity's loops, a Pro at usin' ACID, see
I'm,Able-a-ton, I'm, full of Audacity
Go be a martyr
My plan is to dismantle
The panel by cuttin' samples deeper
Than evil barbers, *uhn*
Hissin' kittens go missin' like Jimmy Hoffa
Spittin, poppin and sizzlin
Flippin like Benihana
Sittin in odd positions in kitchens wit Mr. Rogers
Swimmin' in cinnamon-drizzled
Women with Willy Wonka
Huh, you really for really? cuz, how I'm feelin
I'm still as ill as a pill from a filthy favela doctor
Chillin within a village of villains
Who kill imposters
9-Milli for spillin your melon of all its' contents
I'm, lyrically thrill-killin like Philly mobsters
Still fillin' rosters fuller than Prima donnas
Or frilly Madonnas
Ain't no tellin' what fresh Hell
Is awaitin; to Hell with Satan - like I'm agnostic
An anvil, we can't fully acknowledge
Will of an animal
A pair of gills, evolving
Grill up a million dollar bills and feel accomplished
Sick of all of these so-called 'brilliant' melodramas
Built like Silverback gorillas
To deal with silly bitches who still
Insist shit like Amityville is haunted
You bottom-billin, you can't be the illest artist
Rappin all fuckin' antsy: Andy Milonakis
Bambi-slash-pansy/Bam-Bam and Betty
Can't stand a preppie in
Tan pants and plenty of
Grand-Am obsessing
*BLAM-BLAM* - I'm ready to transplant
And sever your pineal gland
You better stand stiller than stone
Pray my hand's steady
Won't matter anyways
You was damaged already
Dancin, takin chances, grandstandin' heavy
On the fact I go HAM like
Grand Slams at Denny's
You visitin' tan stands, get man-tans
And then expand your Get Readys
To mani's and pedi's?
Yo, come on...
Alright alright alright, already
I'm back to business like Gyp Rosetti
And Steve Buscemi
And as far as bein' petty
I'm hardcore for pennies
I want Moore(more) like Demi
So gimme your fucking Emmy
Eating No-Name-brand spaghetti
In Eddie's Chevy
As ready as ever, heavily redolent
Of the Remy
My men are benevolent
A maleficent new maleovolence
Reverence evident in whichever devils I ready

(CHORUS)
Line's gittin' long
I don't give a fuck...
Rhyme-spittin, on-rhythm
I don't give a fuck...
So whatchu gittin on?
Git - gittin on?
What'chu gittin' on? Git - gittin' on??
Time tickin' on...I don't give a fuck
I am far beyond
Fuckin' out ta lunch...
So whatchu gittin on?
Git - gittin, Git - gittin' on?
Gittin' on deez muthafuckas, whats up???

Gittin on deez muthafuckas
Whats up?
