HERO

First off rest in peace to the lives lost in Vegas

[Verse 1]

Senseless gun violence
Senseless gun violence
Lord please protect us cause the world is in a crisis
World politicians do not give a fuck about us
White man rule the whole world it’s still slavery
Granted for the fact that they’ll never set those chains on me
Pure black excellence gifted blessed with intelligence
Molded by the negligence the words kept me prevalent
Dark clouds above my head I still hear the rain falling
Jumped over the edge, can’t walk bitch I’m still crawling
Feeling like I’m on my Wayne 08 Shit
Stuck to the ground my feet never left the pavement
Dreams opened up like heaven minus having to die
Except the sacrifices made left damages on my mind
How you gonna forget the memories that kept us together
You we’re supposed to be down with me forever
But enough of that, only focus now is bring the feeling back
Labels signing niggas for 360 deals this shit is real
Take yo whole check like Deebo straight out of Friday
That’s why declining offers helped me stay in my pocket
Meanwhile my grandfather died, family over everything
Married to the game and I amount to give my everything
4th quarter finish like Brady throwing to Brandin Cooks
I just move in silence black George Clooney yeah you’ll never lose me
Don’t push me to the edge my nigga
Prepping for this Hero album & I’m still independent
While they still chasing pensions trynna feel important
But the feelings dormant I am here to claim the title
The west coast needed hope I put that shit on my back
Nigga barely no videos, no getting caught with hoes
No selling out except the crowds rocking at the shows
Did it with the music yeah your favorite rapper never could
Redefined the climate and I calculate the pedestal
The same niggas hating be the same niggas watching close
Been in the stu with the great ones spitting hope
Priceless information you can’t find in a database
That's been passed from OG’s here to save the day
Tre Capital living legend I declare today
Took 2 years just to kill ya’ll niggas
Had to fix my broken bond with my pops, stay close to him
Younger siblings calling my phone don’t pick up
Friends turned to foes the success starts a mixup
Don’t even go to clubs unless their’s a bag involved
Build me up or break me down preceding all my predecessors
Battling depression writing records can’t catch reception
If I was to die just know that I stayed the truest
Let's finally see what happens when niggas just face the music
