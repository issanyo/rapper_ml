Intro:
Daytona: Yo Typ
Typ iLL: Whats up
Daytona: Get that Zafra out the freezer….I think shorty gonna like it…
Typ iLL: You think shorty gonna sip that?

Daytona Chorus:
I thought I saw that pussy cat
Crazy, in the middle where she put me at
Oh shit. Keep doing what I like bitch
Looks could kill, you got a license

Daytona Verse 1:
Dirty blonde hairs on my pillow case
You see a silloutte? Wait til you can see her face
Ayyy
I just lay back and watch her demonstrate
Said she feel it in her chest when I penetrate
Make me forget the rest at the end of day
Know a nigga gotta win if you let him play
Something like phil Jackson, my zen like ways allow me
To see the light knowing they throw shade, I refrain
Don’t give it any type of notice, you niggas is bogus
Take yourself too serious, you screaming like Otis
Know I keep a dope bitch around, who know to stick around
Cause she so sick of clowns
..I feel ya
All these bitches quote Marilyn
Its nothing but lavish niggas that’s stabbin’ it, open the cabinet
She liking the pills, knowing she bad as shit
With a license to kill
The homey Typ ill

Typ iLL Verse 2:
Ayo I open doors, pull out seats
Even suck on her feet
Baby girl know im a freak
I couldn’t sleep
Thinking ‘bout this fatty on the blonde
Im wondering she got the same fatty on her mom
She keeps me happy, uh
A crazy lady with daddy issues but fuck the best, suck the best
Leg room in the caddy,uh
I put her in a pretzel
Blonde lover, vanilla covered I eat it sexual, I do it gladly, uh
Order that dinner special
Then dessert with different positions that we sex to,she want it badly, uh
Im on it, she on it
Dawn it, morning no yawning im diving in, scream Geronimo
Now she falling like dominos
We know the story though
We know how the story goes
Fall in love with these hoes
End up on the Maury show
My blonde lady, my blonde Saddam Bomb baby
Bleach, beach bum, I need one, come on baby

Daytona Chorus:
I thought I saw that pussy cat
Crazy, in the middle where she put me at
Oh shit. Keep doing what I like bitch
Looks could kill, you got a license
