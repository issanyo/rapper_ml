[Intro]
What, yeah
Yo, flaws and fallacies of life, material items and shit
Beware motherfuckers, word up, don't let it get ya, you know?
This shit ain't nothing, one time, check 'em out, yo

[Verse]
You live the life of a hustle, not sympathetic to a user
Making cats fast taking trips to Bermuda
Elegant women, all lovely and feminine
Houses with arces and big pools for swimming in
Big transactions, swiping all the action
Driving a Benz and Lex, you be like maxing
Jewels be on truck shit, rims with fat clusters
Diamonds on your teeth, shining shimmers and lusterous
And God's hanging sideways, holding your head high
Cruising through a block, so you past a dreads
Now the dreads are looking hard at your face Mr. Fly Guy
Unaware tonight their gonna do a fucking drive by
Go home watch a sci-fi flick, with a chick
'til 10 p.m., now it's time for you to dip
Go round up a few men hold a classified
Info inside, hand picked these nigga's you confided
In the shipment to pick up quick, click off Clyde's
Seven numbers for you if their gonna demise
A scheme of betrayal, guess in your valley
You was higher then self work, short from another fly guy
By George I think he's got it, chicks gooms and lump sums
Trickering 5-0 wild to be like dumb dums
One of the few never having a heart
Issue was smart some ass with it, came to cash don't give a shit
Attitude more money and more money
Dog days bright and more sunny
4 in the morning drinking Seneca apple juice in the rent a car
Neighborhood star, got riddled and scarred
A lose cannon or cannons, over famish foe
Became shaddow or did death and did damage
Now I knew this kid true to life, word life
He preached righteousness and shit and turned to be a Hypocrite
