(Verse)

Gone for the weekend
Time for play
So much we’ve learned while riding this fast train
But when bags are packed up, we haven’t sacked, but I will be back real soon

Monday’s a drag but Friday’s near
And oh how I’ve yearned for just one more time dear
‘Cause once we are dancing, heat waves enhancing
Going home alone won’t do


(Hook)

Roll, roll, roll Celia
She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacation
She was just home and I’m patient…

Roll, roll, roll Celia
She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacay-cay-cay-cay (echo out)…

And that’s OK with me, youknownamsayin?
And that’s OK with me

She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacation. (Yeah)
She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacation

Ah yeah
OoOoOoOoh, oh
OooooOOOOoooh
Oh yeah
Ah yeah (x2)


(Bridge)

And it feels so good
To know
You were with me, back at home
I said it feels so good
To know
She was with me, right back home, yeah
I wanna go back home, yeah, with you, and me
How we used to do
Ayy
Ah yeah


(Shout out to DJ Zo)


(Verse)

Look, look, look…
I kick flows for ya
Rip down shows for ya
Hit the strip and do gigs on the road for ya
Lord knows I’ll walk a tight rope for ya
Do the crime, then I’ll lie under oath for ya
Do my time on the grind in the cold for ya
Do or die ‘til I lie in a hole for ya
We stay sealed like a kiss to a rose for ya
No amount of bills could appeal what I owe to ya
No frills, no evidence of hoes in ya
Just a rich history of black gold in ya
Nineteen fifties rock and roll in ya
Sixties…threw the soul in ya
Nineteen seventies, Black Power, Huey B, JB and…ahh…
They put the ‘fro on ya
Eighties, well, that really took a toll on ya
The nineties, well, that’s when we lost control of ya
In the era where the money started moldin’ ya
Nowadays everybody think they roll wicha
Nobody paid ‘til the day they get sold on ya
Nobody pay, everybody download on ya
‘Cause when it’s good, everybody wanna grow on ya
But when it’s hood, keep it on the down low on ya
‘Cause when it’s real, everybody got they nose in ya
And I’m just happy I can vibe out and float wicha
Pick a pocket, locked in a loc’ wicha
Stick a socket, throw around notes wicha
Pick a topic, no tellin’ where I go wicha
But when I leave, no that my seed grow wicha
I never leave
I’m diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we…
And the whole picture
And the whole picture

Yeah, 1, 2, Breezy Lovejoy
Rest in peace B.I.G
