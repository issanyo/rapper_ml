[Tragedy Khadafi]
Niggas scared to pull a hit
For shit, my team will know a bitch sniff a pyramid of a dollar bill, she will, 97 to the hill
Get ill, do your thing, I ain't mad at you son
It's how you feel...

[Noreaga]
Yo, blood scene, bloody my vision can't see
Straight off top, me ral and Mussolini
Was tied up, connect thinking that we wired up
Once these ropes get cut I'm getting highed up
Slow it down, you moving too fast
Kid it's the halves, you ain't know
It's illegal life shit, big bloody cash
So what you do, in due time, come back in view
That's why niggas can't relate to L.A., they stick you
Let's laundrymat this, revolution this Iblis
Keep the world in fits, my clique avoid death list
Black gangsta, 2 5 I co-perfect this
CNN, iced out piece, italian necklace
Stef bauer, you and L, yall work the hour
We all dirty, like the clique don’t take shower
There's more to get, hit the fuck up, taking power
100 channels, turn station, operation 140
Earthquake would bring glory
Noreaga, but for short just call me Nore
Catagory, point-blank end of the story

Chorus

[Capone]
Never sweat D’s, I let trees blow
Get bent on benches, hopping the fences
Here they come in long trenches, crack
Chase 'em, lace 'em, let the chef bake 'em
Jake, taste 'em, take 'em, wonder where we make 'em
Roll dice, and break 'em on the street corner
Betting stacks, holding packs,
Hoping police don't run deep on us
Peep the third floor shade that never rises
For Jake, I hold weight, plus gats in greater sizes
Bullet proof down to my Nike's now we the livest
Survivest, open offa' lah contact, combat
Twisting yer cap, and listen to rap
Postion to mack , to blow out your back
Ho's across the map, foe's eat a dick in fact
I'm a score, flip more raw than Dominique Dawes
Yea flip that

Chorus 4x

Yo black gangsta, where they at, where they at
Queensbridge and Iraq
