[Intro: KRS-One]
Uhh! Yeahhh
I know you're diggin' this type of shit right here
We about to spark it on the mic, yeahhh
Come on!

[Chorus]
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm

[Verse 1: KRS]
The episode starts when I walk down the block, kid
Reach in my pocket, yo where's my knot, it
Follows me into the spot, compellin'
Go check the dread and yes he's herb sellin'
A punani gate, I'm a potential felon
Izm is smellin', like I ain't even tellin'
Channel one two, I'm smashin' the law
Channel three, I make a run to the store
Channel four leave the store with the Phillie 'cause I...
Spark the izm, I'm off to Channel Live

[Verse 2: Hakim]
Wake up in the mornin' got the yearnin' for herb
Which loosens up the nouns, metaphors, and verbs
And adjectives, ain't it magic kid what I'm kickin'
Multi-flavored bags of sess, for the pickin'
So listen to the izm as it talks non-stop
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin' but so is the chocolate Thai
Now the high, starts to settle
Kickin' fat lyrics that rocks, like heavy metal

[Verse 3: KRS]
I'm comin' out to dance with da spliff of senseiÂ 
When I speak, big up Mack, L.O., and Malik
Like John Lennon, yes I'm I-Z-M'n
I start grinnin', and syllables start bendin'
My style is intangible, like a wild animal
Check the label as it goes round it's on Capitol
That's what I'm smackin' you with cause it's easy
Like Lionel Richie, your whole style is bitchy
Switch me, mix me, somebody get me
Don't let me rip out my clothes like Bill Bixby
Rippin' the microphone 'til I'm motherfuckin' sixty
Smokin' the indo, by the window, it's sticky

[Verse 4: Tuffy]
Come spark the izm, my expertism, is lyricism
My flow will take you over, like I was hypnotism
So where's the lighter? To decipher, the skills that I'm bringin'
Hyper than a little kid on ginseng roots
And culture, my intellect will insult ya
Finish off your dead mind like a vulture
I gotta get mine, get a grip
Cause there's all these weak rappers steady makin' hits, FUCK THAT!
But '94, I bring the skills back
So listen now I'm doin' what I want to do and sparkin' mad izm

[Chorus]
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm

[Verse 5: Tuffy]
I come with notions, deeper than the ocean
Check out my potion, mad rhythm in the motion
The izm, brings the wisdom, when I kick it on the rhythm
Check it how I rock it in a cipher
Desire, takes you higher, lyrical messiah
(Yo yo yo yo-yo, pass that lighter)
Counterclockwise, I rise like the sun
Now feel the heat from the rays of the gun
Shootin' out the mental mist
How you gonna know the real shit when your style's counterfeit?

[Verse 6: KRS]
His shit is counterfeit cause he's motherfuckin' phony
Come into the jam, try to front like he know me
Hah! Listen to this new type of somethin'
Bumpin', '94 ain't for no frontin'
New type of lingo, catchy like a jingle
Roughneck hip-hop is drippin' from the single
Now, let me introduce you to the one
The Channel Live indo this loosens you up
Goin' through the channels of the remote control
Flickin' through the frequencies of your soul

[Verse 7: Hakim]
Then roll the izm, the inflater, I'm weeded
Like wearing a sweater, at the equator, I'm heated
But I flip a style like I flip a channel
Step up and test the skills, you can get my tes-ticules
Cause hip-hop's been running through my veins ever since
So it wasn't hard for me to grab the mic and represent
Representing tormenting MC's craniums
Till they can't flow. Why? Cause I'm drainin' em
Don't mean to be blunt but don't front
I'm doing it for the love so now I'm doin' what I want
To do with my Channel Live crew so just listen
Dissin' wack MC's and sparking up mad izm

[Chorus]
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
Mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
Mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
Mad izm...
