[Hook]
Yo, nigga you got me?, Yeah nigga I got you
So you know I pop them before I let them pop you
Yo, homie you got me?, Yeah homie I got you
So you know I rock them before I let them rock you
Yo, family you got me?, Yeah family I got you
So you know I drop them before let them drop you
Yo, nigga you got me?, Yeah nigga I got you
So you know I pop them before I let them pop you

[Verse 1]
Yo, friendship is priceless, my niggas is irreplaceable
We capable of conquering the world plus we be caking too
Taking you on different journey just through observation
Occupation, domination, drop a verse to rock the nation
It's that fly shit, I live it Lord vision flawed possibly
I get it popping for my niggas so they pop for me
Let's grind for cheddar, dine together, we can shine forever
When I be falling off, you hold me up, my mind is better
Due to the jewels that we exchange within the circle
I take a niggas life before I ever let them hurt you
And that goes for all of my mans, I love my family
Cock back on camera screens the hammer pleads insanity
God forbid I die for y'all, but ya'll rather me live
I rather see my niggas shine than see ya [?] in a bid
That's that real shit, loyalty is royalty ahk
To all my G that kept it real, just please believe that I ain't forgot

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If I shine, we all shine, fam it's vise versa
Let niggas try to front on my squad we might merk ya
Rep of the illest realest gorillas that ever did it
Lets clique forever stick together, other niggas did it
We think a little different that's why everybody winning
It's all about the team that's even when we bagging women
Like yo ma, just crossed the street, shorty don't run from us
All of us looking different, you gotta like one of us
If anybody hold him we all got a gun to bust
Reality, challenge my G? You gotta challenge me
Basically alchemy I put friends over a salary
Put money over everything else, it make's the world spin
All of us, moving as one, it's like a whirlwind
Natural disaster every chapter thinkin' faster
Police can come and capture, my loyalty wouldn't fracture
Worrying mine getting left behind isnt a factor
[Hook]
