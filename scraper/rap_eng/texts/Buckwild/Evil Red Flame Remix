Evil Red Flame

[Verse]
I'm callin' to collect, take it or leave it
Five minutes out yo' day, get it this evenin'
Niggas fakin' on me, before I was famous
Nobody open doors, everybody was playin'
Now I got a lil' success, everybody be hatin'
I can't register, niggas stole the cash registers
Please, this is [?]
Hangs out in the hood, and the secret race
Niggas like me had to sleep in the basement
'Cause on the grind don't stop, you play some
Niggas think they untouchable, but I separate the cheese like a Lunchable
Nigga, I am not Theo Huxtable
This is not Fresh Prince, this is BasedGod hustle
Learn to strive, see the BasedGod muscle
Real dogs in the pen, see the BasedGod muscle
Niggas think that he [?]
Heh, I don't believe that
Niggas change with environments
Yeah, I got the faith, nigga, like a college kid
Look at me, I got a scholarship
I did graduated from a hood scholar to the BasedGod
Evil Red Flame, yeah
