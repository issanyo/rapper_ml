[Hook]
Yo, we been official since way back, it’s real
Fly hands, buy grams, eat clams, you know the drill
Stay sharp, fresh sneakers, never sing
Politicking while we flipping, getting money ain’t a thing
Peace to all my brothers on lock down
They keep us holding their spots down, I see you
Fresh uniforms, moving in unison
Fall back homie, we moving in, officially

[Verse 1]
Yo, rocking hirachis like I’m Jerry Seinfeld
Forever rhyme skilled, collecting cake, it got my mind filled
Thinking bout ways that I could innovate, another day, another plate
Fuck looking in this [?] when we bout to infiltrate
Street shit but readily spoken, my pedigree’s potent
My wife is beefing bout who I’m allegedly poking
Street tabloids put me on blast, I rock filthy
But Imma tell my chick let’s go to trial, I’m not guilty
Fresh shape ups, and silk scarves, physically draped
Futuristic where the niggas got lapped and think we late
I’m so Queens even when I’m OT, wildlife [?] and salmon that possess omega 3
Lord and savior when it comes to flavor
Easter eligible architecture, everything is major
Illegible thoughts, invisible soldier stats
Translucent fortunes, holding gats while rocking golden plaques

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Keep time, covered by synthetic sapphire
Attract fire, attack sire, my pack higher
I’ll tell you that your desire’ll have prior too
A dough hood, stunting on the block cause it felt good
Reamin calm, get popped over a qualm
Been the don since I went to prom with shawty from Guam
I’m like move, disco dan with a different hand
Speed ball or 8 ball, great call, I’m pitching fam
Different plan slightly, rose gold and Nike
Next new king of New York, nigga I might be
We turn real divas into cheerleaders
Hit the liquor store, cop drinks and share liters
The spare [?] on the dark path without math
I worry bout this money son, let’s talk about cash
Ho freaks at my best, snow beach on my vest
Try my best not to catch no Fs and stay fresh

[Hook]
