Verse: Napoleon Da Legend
This is not a façade
Nostradamus out for dominance PharahGamo’s a monument
Bombing em with some homonyms front on mines and we mobbing em
This for your monitors knock this my conglomerate rock shit
Choke the game up carbon monox(ide) shit
Locksmith lion at the gate keepers the gates can’t keep em negate
Even the hate achieve greatness I fight for rights while you beefing
With Kanye and Drake and I keep making this heat just to keep em awake
It’s me Leonardo the poet I’m too smart just to blow it
The market I corner I’m god when I’m flowing I’m Boeing
777 convince you in less than 70 second I’m one of the best in the flesh
Ever to do it swift dodging like the Ebekenezer about Zion It’s unjust
Too many of us dying trying to not be crushed by the pressure
Oppression got us depressed there’s not enough oxygen for my chest
They politricking got a pile of tricks acknowledge the trick knowledge
They trying to blind us no equality kid
Trick these kids thinking they listening to quality shit
They got us in the system and that’s when the policy switch
Style switch wallabee kicks two hours we lit
Without these chicks whips and the cribs how would we live?
I’m obviously advance these rappers is scared to be fans
But you’d be damned to even be compared to me man
It’s bar alchemy I set em up like art galleries
I manifest thoughts in my brain it’s all mentality
Assault rivalries with black ops technology
Yall flashing with monopoly money I’m an anomaly
Flood the market leaving blood on the carpet fuck your apartment up
That’s the synopsis you not synonymous to MCing
Matter fact you shall remain anonymous no matter what your
Budget and how hard you try to market it
Created a fantasy world and you got lost in it you forcing it
Looking like food I’m a put a fork in it
How you winning when you forfeiting
I’m forbidden a formidable force you just a forth of him
Lord forgive em I’m a figure four him reconfigure his organs
Make him catch rigamortis and make figure from touring
