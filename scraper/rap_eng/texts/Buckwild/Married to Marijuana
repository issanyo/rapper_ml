{​*girls talking*}​
Yo why the fuck you just don't leave that nigga Nore alone
(You don't understand I love him)
But he ain't feelin you (he's feelin me)
He's feelin that other bitch (Nah)
Face it when he goes to the studio she's there waitin for him (what)
When he's writin she there next to him (fuck outta here)
When you page him and he don't call you back
Who you think he be with
(I guess I lost my man to that bitch)

[Verse 1: Noreaga]
Yo married to Marijuana, stabilized persona
I bone a bitch anytime I wanna
It feel good just to see her in the all black
Lookin all that tell her I wanna be with her
Everynight sleep with her
Some sneak you in jail open your nappy walls
Like bullet hole sores smoke you out during intercourse
I'm jealous knowing that you restin with them fellas
On the other side niggas I don't fuck with
Don't even talk to the way they act I could see they hawk you
When I roll is like I undress you
When I smoke it's like I done blessed you
Taste is the best ..travel across ocean
West Coastin' searchin for the potent
I ain't wanna beat you mistreat you What!
I thug you out and let my duns hit you
Menage it's two of ya'll hydro and black tar
Rap seminar me and Akbar dusty cigar
Noreaga N O R EA GA got AK fuck more bitches around way
Than the average nigga cuz most niggas is broke niggas
Get they drink on I get my dick on
Word bond I had this one bitch that led me on
Smelled like baby powder
Got out the shower 'round the god hour
Told me my love stronger last longer
Like a Duracell keep tickin I'm long dickin'
Strokin' her down provokin' her now to go down
Strokin' her down Strokin' her down

Get high now
Get high get high now
Get high get high

Yo to the chicks that get high with me
Smoke La with me come on girl
Why don't you come around my world

To the chicks that get high with me
Smoke La with me come on girl
Why don't you come around my world

To the chicks that get high with me
Smoke La with me come on girl
Why don't you come around my world

My world my world my world
My world my world my world

Married to Marijuana Married to Marijuana
Got a nigga whipped yo I'm whipped off that shit

[Verse 2: Noreaga]
Yo when I first fucked you I admit I didn't like it
It felt like my brain got kicked somebody spiked it
I was in the bathroom I consumed mad boom
Goin back to my women smellin' like perfume
Started arguments mad emotion
Thinkin that I'm jokin when I said I wasn't strokin'
Was only tokin' she didn't believe me
Called up Musolini Yo where dun at
Where he was at last night
Asking mad questions interrogatin smoking sessions
The last lesson I get high that's true confession
From Iraq to El Segundo I hold a gun though
And get high for all my niggas livin' on the run though
I'm livin' this doin' this since the days of K-Swiss
Helados, poppin' bottles, some family resign
We live the life of crime nigga just shine
What What

Get high get high get high nigga get high
Get high nigga get high get high
