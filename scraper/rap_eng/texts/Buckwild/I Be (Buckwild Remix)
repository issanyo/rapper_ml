[Intro]
If I ain't shit
And you ain't shit
And he ain't shit
Then we all Misfitss
If I ain't shit
And you ain't shit
And he ain't shit
Then we all Misfitss (come on)

[Hook]
I be representing the Misfitss (what, what?)
Who be, who be representing the Misfitss? (come on)
I be, I be representing the Misfitss (what, what?)
Who be, who be, who be representing the Misfitss?

[Verse 1: Rubberband]
Trials and tribulations
Stations to stations
I smoke blunts for self to learn a plan to rule a nation
Who's this dizzy MC, don't want to copy cat me
Brother my name, you have no fame
No type of flair in your game

[Verse 2: Mush Mouth]
Suppose, suppose
Persistent to be giving up some bows
When I impose or knows
Stay up like NoDoz
Homie knows when I inhale the sack [?]
Leaving 'em paralyzed when I emphasize that..
..hehe hahaha


[Verse 3: Peek A Boo]
And no I'm no that zodiac [?] maniac in fact a matter of fact
I be the mack coming from the ghetto
So I stay strapped with my party ghetto metal
Minus othello, hello, blessed
By the [?] of the Apollo
[?] people need to follow
If not go tomorrow
All those problems will be solved oh oh oh oh

[Hook]
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be, who be representing the Misfitss?

[Verse 4: Mush Mouth]
Frustration [?] twist with a lisp of the lost
I boss sacrifice the dice for us
Euphemistic when I kick it
Vocal psychic cuz I rip and [?] spit it

[Verse 5: Peek A Boo]
Well let me kick it just for a minute
So I can rip it and run the fuck up in it
And just remember and just remember and just remember member
Ha wack ass MC's
Keep bringing me back to the technicality
That I'm a menace to society
But in reality
I'm only a bell with no capital L
Well well well well peace to the back of the bus
And peace to the front of the bus
Most of all peace to us

[Hook]
I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be, who be representing the Misfitss?

[Verse 6: Rubberband]
I can see it now, no more [?]
Brooklyn where you at? over here do or die
Super strong performance even plastic man
Rubberband's the man, my body bend through the wastelands
I torture the scorcher, you're pops should have taught ya
You're brown roots to the new school ain't no old school
I'm a rebel to my balls, ain't no cause, go for yours
My crew represents all the times I break jaws for the law
When it's war ride till all fall
Dissolving Mc's [?]

[Verse 7: Mush Mouth]
I keep my gun butt on the barrel cuz the gravity
[?] when it comes to denim
Get em grab the mic and scheme
Fiend for the thing when I rip the spleen out of the inseams of my jeans
[?]
You wanna be a hard rock well it's more than fatigue
I flip the mental for the nappy headed dogs
And for an adolescent heres a instrumental for the dirty broads

[Hook]
I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be, who be representing the Misfitss?

Who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
I be, I be representing the Misfitss
Who be, who be, who be representing the Misfitss?
