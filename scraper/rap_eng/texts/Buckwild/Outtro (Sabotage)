[Emcee(s): O.C.]
[Producer(s): Buckwild]
[Additional Vocals: Prince Po]
[Sample (Melody): Faze-O - “Riding High”]

[Intro: Prince Po and O.C.]
Prince Po: Hallelujah!  Inhale the air while it lasts.  We’re here to be studied.  Slaves we’ve been—hell, we still are.  We own nothing, we fight for nonsense.  It’s all science fiction.  Dreams in excess equals positive objectives.  Bronx streets, poisoned humans, polluted minds, distortion
O.C.: Life, death, man, woman, and child.  Yeah.  Planet Earth, all these things.  Listen

[Verse 1: O.C.]
My mind is
Grand like endless sand, warning off
The C-4 defeats the flam.  For some strange
Reas’, I seize my outcome sort of like
Fate was foresaw by Malcolm.  The stage is
My panel, the crowd are my disciples—they control
My music and its lifecycle.  Friends hard
To come by, they’re shady when I strut.  Fools stand
Back, waiting, laying in the cut, hate but
Smiling, spiting my life.  Talking, she be
Evil, looking sharp as a knife.  From dawn
To dusk, my ass I bust, limit
My cuss, in God I trust, flush bad
Memories, smash thoughts of enemies, focus on
Solutions, come up with remedies.  Infinite
Thought supports me throughout so.  So much more
To say, but this is the outro (This is the outro)

[Outro: Prince Po]
We all perish one day, we suffer until the end.  Who gets the happiness?  How do we find it?  Why do we keep up the habit?  Why do we continue?  Where is the break end?  Can we be cleansed mentally?  Help us, endure us.  Pollution clutters the black woman’s mind, we’re all ghetto-struck.  Sabotage!
