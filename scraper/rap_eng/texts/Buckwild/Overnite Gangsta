[Verse 1]
Ay, you know that punk who used come and try to cool out
But always had to check when a nigga pull a tool out
Even if it was to check the bullets in the clip
And someone starts to slip
"Hey, yo I gotta dip"
So niggas used to be like I have grate, nigga rotate
Before you hit the crib go and buy yourself a whole cake
'Cause everybody used to play your ass out
Even those who didn't know you knew what you were about
You come around to wait with the blunt and the forty
And niggas who used to tax you would say "we out shorty"
If you were short it wouldn't matter at all
But the only thing to body you is 6 feet tall
And niggas call you shorty 'cause you took some shorts
Yo, the way you got played you must be good at much sports
'Cause yous a bitch and I heard yous was a snitch
Last time you got dropped you ran and took it to the cops
You wasn't man enough to back your own behind up
Pussy motha'fucka pointing niggas in the lineup
Make your mind up niggas yous a pranksta
You little punk, yous an Overnite Gangsta

[Hook]
Overnite Gangsta, you gets no 'spect
Back in the days, yo you always got checked
You're an Overnite Gangsta, you just can't switch
Once you're a bitch, yo you're always a bitch
You're an Overnite Gangsta, you gets no 'spect
Back in the days, yo you always got checked
You're an Overnite Gangsta, you just can't switch
Once you're a bitch, yo you're always a bitch

[Verse 2]
The other day I see you hoopin' in and 'round the way
Frontin' hard, 'cause you was pumpin' shit by Dr Dre
Well you can pump Ice Cube, Geto Boys and Ren
You'll still get ya ass smacked like back then
'Cause this is the real with the ill cold steel
And the bullets that you feel in your guts to make you kneel
Like a slut suck ya nuts, for you and us nigga
What the fuck give it up, niggas know yous a duck
Yo, I know I busta yo, I buck a nigga type shit
But my person must be threating on me, then I might flip
But you be screaming "murder", when you never fight shit
Your front end need a stunt man you punk bitch
Make your mind up kid, yous a pranksta
People know yous an Overnite Gangsta
