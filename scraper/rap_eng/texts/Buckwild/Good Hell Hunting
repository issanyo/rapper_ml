[Hook: Celph Titled]
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
And go dummy to the max, show them boys that you'll clap, brrat
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
Fuck rap, cop a brick, cook it up and make crack

[Verse 1: Planetary]
I'm about to take a bath in holy water
Swimmin' in the red wine the priest about to offer
Then throw a burnt cross at the alter
Altered Beast authors authorizing the slaughters
I advise you, go inside your office
Officially resign 'cause every rhyme is monstrous
If not, I'mma knock you unconscious
I be on that Philly shit, swing like Bronx Bombers
I keep the streets packed like Yonkers
Body every verse and drive your turf bonkers
Cutting the grass, surpassing the snake charmers
Crazy in the 80s and still they cannot calm us
Waiting for that payment with the commas
Niggas keep hating we embrace them with the llamas
School of Hard Knocks, graduating with honors
Cap and gown is more like some camouflage bombers

[Hook: Celph Titled]
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
And go dummy to the max, show them boys that you'll clap, blllllat
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
Fuck rap, cop a brick, cook it up and make crack

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
Y'all niggas is below average, I'm above savage
I'm your worse nightmare dipped in 'Lo fabric
Keep the flow rapid, keep my doe stacking
Keep your ho from the stage when the show happening
HÃ©ctor Lavoe, Ted Bundy reincarnated
Voice box is gold, I murder 'cause that's how God made it
Angel of Death, mangled off Beck's
Strangle your breath, leave your corpse slumped on the steps
I run with the best, ripping out chunks of your flesh
Never regret, I ain't the one to go and reflect
The gun is possessed
And it's infected by the Holy Spirit
The future is now but y'all ain't really trying to hear it
My ribs touching and this ain't open for discussion
My blood rushing, your blood gushing, your mouth crushing
We cold crush 'em, foe flush 'em, they hold nothing
We coke rumming, throat cutting, so fuck 'em

[Hook: Celph Titled]
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
And go dummy to the max, show them boys that you'll clap, blllllat
It's good hell hunting season so grab you a strap
Fuck rap (fuck rap, fuck rap)

[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
It don't matter if you do not get a flu shot, my shots flew
In the air the guns still hot, yeah the M82A2
Same one I had on So Cold, I'm so dope at rap (c-c-clap)
Sledgehammer flows, I got it on smash
And y'all can take the long road, I'm crossing over the median
Bounty Hunter technology, weaponry heat seeking
Watch how I be freaking 'em, you should take a picture bitch (shit)
Can't see me? You should get your light fixtures fixed
Violate your dress code, leave your suit vest coat
Was at your house party but I left 'cause all y'all played was techno
Transmit commands through subsonic sound promos
My verse coerced dolphins to shoot darts out of they blow holes
Cow ping, Yao Ming might pop shots at Elroy
How do you ring bells when you're a bellboy?
I employ, I am a boss
Harness the power of Alcatraz, Albatross
1000 proof alcohol
What?!
