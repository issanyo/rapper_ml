Ayo waddup Mr. Star
We'll make you see stars
Cuz I can pop niggas like my niggas pop cars
I serve mothafuckas like wars
Since I don't live in the sky
Don't classify me as a star
Now I don't give a fuck if a sucka (?)
You won't be livin' fat with a bullet from a gat in em
You just anotha sucka starin' hard bitch
You fuck around and try to step and catch a scar stitch
I don't look for beef but when I look for beef
I take my car and park it in the mothafuckin' meat market
You couldn't throw blows if your mouth and arms
Cause i'm real rapper that  label people by the colour

No matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
