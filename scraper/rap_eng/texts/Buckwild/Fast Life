The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin' the life of Riley packin' fifty calis
Rockin lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count math from steam baths
We've seen a half a Milli Jackson out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin straight charming in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots to come through a whole army
The cee-lo rollers, money folders, sippin' Bolla, holdin mad payola
Slangin that Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son

[Chorus]
Livin' the fast life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream
Livin' the fast life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery: shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lexo but who's petro
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin Cristal like it's my first child, lickin shots, holiday style
Rockin Steele sweaters, Wallabee down
Twenty-four carats, countin cabbage, like the arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin catchin cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The Luciano, Frankie Yale, Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal

Brother you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeahhh, get this money, yeahhh
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, heyy yeah yeah

[Verse 3: G Rap & Nas]
[Rap] Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
[Nas] Esquire attire standin on ground with one pivot
[Rap] Two players rockin silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
[Nas] Lands with namebrand seats reclinin like in spaceships
[Rap] Bodies on ice
[Nas] Livin trife, rollin fixed up dice
[Rap] Gamblin Grants
[Nas] Handlin stamps
[Duo] Moves are sheist
[Nas] My bankrolls, got the cops comin in plain clothes
[Rap] Tryin to arraign the gang cause of our fame that's how the game goes
[Nas] True
[Rap] Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin up grams with Arm & Hammer supplyin scramblers in Alabama
[Nas] Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin' in cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Carribean suites, deep, rippin beats with flows
[Rap] Aiyyo, we went from standin on blocks, without some socks
Sellin rocks, to pickin up stock and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
[Nas] Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

[Chorus]
Livin' the fast life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream
Livin' the fast life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream
