Uh, uh
What (mothafucker)
The fuck y'll want
D.I.T.C
Nigga what
Shh
Y'll niggas is creeps
Straight up
Yo'll, laying in the cut type nigga
What!

[O.C.]
Strangers I don't trust
Peep out the scenery so I can adjust (coo)
Once was a foo
'Til I learned the rules, the hard way
Peace by jukes, I was shook
Got slept, nowadays I'm keeping it stepped
But it ain't to the point that I'm rocking a vest
I'm in as well, shit, 'til I die
Till then I'm staying fly
On the reg staying out of the red
Blood, sweat with no tears
Fuck having fears
Two thou's dead on, i'm meeting it dead on
Millennium, many dumb to the fact
You clap that Mush shit I'm a bust right back
For realer, live nigga, see it in my eyes
If ya, test my strength I'm a give you a surprise nigga
Some what the quiet type
I'm not the cat in the party that will start the fight

Chorus: repeat 2X

It's just champagne thoughts (thoughts)
Man made to floss (word)
Vanity or lust (lust)
Greed makes more
Lets stick up the bank and make off with it all (all)
Pick up and start where the others left off

[O.C.]
Doing what I gotta do at any cause
Knowing life is short
Give or take a few blows with knots to show
Sometimes you make friends especially when
The ends play a part out of nowhere
Skins at the bar
Sucking up
Champagne is just like shit
Attract wanna be wives, nothing but flies
Anybody applies when you stink like dough
Many take a sniff when they walk past O
Or walk past 'Ness to L, Diamond or Buck
A.G and Show, that nigga Fat Joe
The ones giving head figure it count for dead
Prez pays offs, deep throat my crew you gon' stay whores
Goin' in spots like swat, my entourage stepping through free of charge
Everybody watch bouncers clout the VIP
A space reserved for the whole D.I.T.C

Chorus 2X

Yo'll Yo'll  (over last 2 lines of chorus)

[O.C.]
I got G's on mind Cream to blow at times
Weed smoke once in a blue, it's something to do
Whip around one deep in my LS4
Shorty nose open wide like she sniffin' it raw
Got a low crossed out, buckwilin' is a no, no
Rap name O.C, Mush Shine be my M.O
Just to find the means in the end
When it's all set it s done, with a crib and keys to a Benz
Twin 9 Berettas serial scrape the letters
Wherea keep 'em tucked inside the wine leather
Cyanide thoughts make shots ring off
Sabotage with a snitch who decided to talk
Greedy niggas get snatched by the Rico laws
Then the murder one stuck, when it rain it pours
Young cats with cigars inside our jaws
Young black entrepreneurs read about us in Forbes

Chorus 3X (with ad-libs)

D.I.T.C, nigga
