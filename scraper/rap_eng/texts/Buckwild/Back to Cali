Bless and OC goin back to Cali
High to the moon when I wrap the cavi
Cold in the arm, that's how the watch be
Toast in the palm and the cops watch me
We ain't them niggas that spit off the head
We them niggas that'll spit and off your head
Niggas tellin me "A, why you lost your mind?"
Your brains on the street, look, now you lost your mind
Bon Appetit, Mush, soon to come
Dickin your girl in the bush and I'm soon to cum
Smooth and ride out, slow the pace up
Take shots like a 31 Pacer
Get your smoke on and throw your l's up
One love Corleone and throw your L's up
On the block with the fiends that cop the rock
In the drop with the gleam that rock the rock
Yeah, I eat pork, I ain't god but I'm buildin
Why the city wanna put gods in the buildin
I don't wear a lotta red but still a Diablo
Hit with 42, one more than Diallo

Whoa

When me and Bless step in the place they show fear

[ VERSE 2: O.C. ]
Yo, as a young lad I used to eat my mush
Now I'm older, baby pa, so they call me Mush
Come steppin in my face, get straight up mushed
Cause I was born from puss don't mean that I'm puss
I'm from the Bush dash w-i-c-k
Faggot niggas, they can suck a d-i-c-k
This is easy for me, flow is easily achieved, flow
Stay in my pockets in bulks, my proceeds go
Straight to the bank on the block rollin celo
And guess who's controllin the bank - Mush
Numero uno in the raps that I spank - Mush
Top rank, who wanna rank on the kid, I'm no joke
Generals, I snatch stripes off your chest and lower your ranks
It's a brand new era, no room for errors
I'm from back when Acs was chromed out with ( ? )
Ain't nothin you can tell us, my niggas on the streets tell us
Who's with us and who's straight jealous
Chickens jealous, Sir Fly, I peep with third eye
I wink em with the eye as I casually drive by

[ VERSE 3: A. Bless ]
Haaa...
When the dutch gets stuffed I'm coughin
Bitch-ass niggas get stuffed in coffins
I drove the bricks and puff the water
Get drove to the bridge and dumped in water
(Y'all) can't stop us, it's on and poppin
Flow in the coupe and the chrome is poppin
Cause I pack heavy metal like rock 'n roll
Stop - when I pop niggas drop and roll
[ OC ]
We cock and load, I repeat we cock and load
On some Tommy Lee shit, dog, we rock 'n roll
Bless'll bless you god, bless the child who stole
You get your fingertips burnt to learn, progress and grow
Never judge a book by the face, you catch ox to the face
I call you kid cause I'm grown, know your place
OC and Bless, Bless and OC
This be some fly shit y'all, so sing the chorus with me
