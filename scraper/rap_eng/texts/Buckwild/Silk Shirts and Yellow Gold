[Verse 1]
Flouride blocking your third eye where birds fly
Thoughts murdered like sheeps herded, absurd why
Disturbed lies, frequency speaking the truth
It's whatever fam, we can share wisdom or shoot
Staring out the window looking at the soul of the community
But niggas probably think I'm grilling so they want to shoot at me
Minor mathematics equals suspect addition
Suspicious niggas still get sliced over suspicion
I don't have friends, I got family and acquaintances
This shit we got on deck will get you higher than my maintenance
It's dangerous, Satan is seen in many forms
Friends turn to strangers these days, we whipping Rangers
Clipping gauges, flipping pages in the book of life
Crooked knife, keeping it trife, I breathe excellence
Flexing tints leaving our prince through our Lexington
I'm at the dealership about to cop a Lex again
We'll never be pedestrians that's gripping Tecs again
Tijuana trips, takes sips, fucking with Mexicans
Then hop back on the plane smelling like tequila
Diary of a dealer, homie I keep it realer

[Hook]
Late night, shaking and moving, we cruising
Fiends out fucking with white rocks, abusing
Lifestyle, motion is tight foul, confusing
Lights out, everything's hype now, I'm losing
I played the night shift, ignite spliff and listen to me
Standing on the mound, ain't nobody pitching for me
From the streets to the paper and back
It's on point son, I always keep my vision intact

[Verse 2]
Yo silk shirts and yellow gold speak thoughts my struggles told
My niggas bubble O's and still'll buy the Jungle gold
And loving clothes, materialistic, really a misfit
I can't adapt to basic, I chase the daily I risk it
Rarely a biscuit not in my circumference when I bump it
Gold dots inside of old Glocks will leave you slumped in
Nothing stopping this, monogamous in my relationship
We're countless stacks and making racks so now we getting paper flip
Aim sideways and fly shades maneuver graciously
Mountaintops chiseled in stone, that's where my face'll be
Courageously conquering concrete for street knowledge
My speech polished, speak dollars and cents
My Five Percent tents, live and immense, rise from the bench
Shine for the block, shoot for the team, lust for the dream
Hustle for cream, silence speaks volumes it seems
It's all perception, any question niggas? Repping for Queens

[Hook]
