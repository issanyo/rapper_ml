You'll catch a swift wrist slap if you're calling the two kids whack
I pitch fast when I write, Randy Johnson Diamondbacks
Rhyming at an all-time high rate & im still climbing
Hills silent till the G's come through with the riot
Real noise-makers, point-shavers & joint blazers
Enjoy making a non-believer thankful to hear us
I break allegiance, burn a flag, take some terps & praise the reefer
Ledel ether out the pot spew stew breaking your speaker
Craig Sager suit color super nuked off Lucy straight out the beaker
Rest In Peace I'll see you once I'm peaking like a peeping tom in the streets
This sheet music elite
I breathe bombs when I speak
Ronin's the Enola Gay flying over Nagasaki
That's destroy & rebuild
Blowing the mind is our skill
Explosive lines at free will
Encode the scriptures we fill
Reload the sixteen & spill
It's known to send you some chills
We're known to have no chills
No codeines & no pills
But we got enough green to have Woodstock covered the whole week
I'll probably hit the lottery before I run out of the tree
Undoubtably out of this world astonishing amount of green
Ed Rosenthal's my idol & the enemies the pill industry
Dedicated path torpedo at sea, scud missle type riddle
Rocket launch, heat seak, game on lock, Defcon, Call of Duty
Keep an active vision accurate if you listen
Blasting with the maddest precision
Catching it from my brother Cryogenic we're Jedi Flipping & time shifting
Bending the laws of physics, exposing gimmicks
& proceed to leap over perceived limits & leave the leeches leaking
Behead the behemoth incinerate the snakes & the demons
We built an allegiance to storm the field & take what we believe in
The Nightlight is dim but I know a voids what I formed in
A cyborg forced in a flesh vessel with vital organs
Oddly melodic, free of charges the top bargain
Super sonic sound waves memorize lines like drill sergeants
Emphasize a real artist
It's mainstream whackness verse black market savages
Way past an amateur, level 99 damage
Holographic & magic Mewtew elite status
Smoking out the hollowed bone apparatus
Accurate as Katniss
Hunger for the Game of rapping
Thunder sounds like nothing when we're slapping out the subie wagon
Nothing happens without passion
This all action verse all stagnant the ones who claim to drop bombs are false flagging
I'll eat your so-called napalm opus in one bite
Hocus pocus when I grab the mic unleash the Moldavite
Strapped down to my chest, from outer space to the Czech
& got it shipped to the great Northwest
I face a zip of the cess & feel complacent at best
& slay a track with my best friend its Donkey & Shreck
Along with Ronin the chef, Puss n' Boots with the sword step
Moving you like a chess piece with the audible flex
So press play with your bundle of hay & sprain your neck
CBD crumble helping with the whiplash effect
Every D-e-Y-o-e box the whole Costco parking lot
Rolling woods looking like a hot deli polish dog
Smash the bag, Mazel tov
Peace plant gets passed to the left while we all singing Kumbaya
& if it's cool by ya, I'll turn your two bedroom into a sauna
Gonna wish you never told DeYoe come through with the 'juana
Got enough prerolled to have your mouth dry as a peak Summer drought outside in Ghana
Outshine your top rhymer
Bet you couldn't outline all my imagery, entendres, well personified topics, similes & vast knowledge
Spewing like flu-induced vomit
Hip-hops Dwight Schrute the goofball in the office
