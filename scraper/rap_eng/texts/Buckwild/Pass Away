[Armageddon talking]
To all my, to all my, to all my, to all my
To all my peoples that passed away
Uh huh
To all my peoples that passed away, to all my, to all my
To to to, Free sailing on their wings as they cast away

[Verse 1:Armageddon]
Sometimes I envious on peoples that past away
They so synonym, there wings being cast away
I dream so vivid, the scene shakes me fast awake
I keep thinking maybe somethings tryna show me how to master my faith
They say I'm deep and too complex for rap
But yo, I grew to learn there's more to life then cars and gats
So I chose to shed a light and write my bars with that
But niggas scared to grow so they tend to hold you back
They take this shit that they don't understand and call it wack
Tell you that ain't the way it goes son, that's conscious rap
But y'all running in circles working the same old act
And I done reaching at a level, but I'm wrong for that
And I ain't bitching, I'm just tryna let you know where I'm at
I'm getting old, as my son grows, so do my raps
I feel your misery, you living off the next man's life
He just as bad, cuz he drains you to strengthen his light
I wanna shout out all the two time felons holding guns for weak thugs
Risking their freedom, for short money and weak love
85'ers tryna earn respect from them young boys
Catching temper tantrums, having fits like young boys
And bitches do it too, get defensive and paranoid
See everybody wanna have some power to exploit
Now maybe you can tell me who's the problem at this point
Me or you homes, I hope you following this joint

[Hook:Tony Sunshine]
I need a stress free, people holiday
Just another me, to see another day
So let the slugs breathe
Easy for a day, I feel all alone while the clouds keep ???

[2pac Talking]
All my mother fucking niggas at? my niggas who down to body a nigga in this
Motherfucker
All my riders, all my killers, all my motherfuckers, holla at me man, let me
Know what's up niggas

[2nd Verse:Armageddon]
Niggas tryna please the crowd when they creating their rhymes
I just be thinking out loud, y'all could gotta pay me no mind
Maybe I'm living in the clouds, or just ahead of my time
I got books of all the shit I wrote between all the crimes
Looking back, tryna trace tracks just to see what I find
Nothing but evidence to back to fact the world is mine
And I ain't arrogant, I'm just Intellectually pompous
Cuz I can supersede anything you accomplish
This nigga dry snitching like he looking for sympathy
Nobody give a fuck about you and your history
Do you nigga? Make some shit shop a deal
Cuz that hot shit you talkin could get you popped forreal
Take my advice, I suggested like a cotton a meal
If not, fuck it, you can starve and keep your eyes peeled
But, don't get me involved, I don't owe you shit
The same goes for that little bitch that's all on my dick
Your all just a bunch of miserable fucks
Broke, mad, drunk , high and gangsta'ed up
It's so sad, I wish that I could cry for him and her
I'm busy mastering this balance act tryna stay up
And there ain't no looking back, I got my crazy mind made up
My nigga L home just in time to witness me bust
Niggas say and speak the truth, getty that's whatsup
Go in the booth, produce the proof, show these niggas how to really get bucks

[Hook]
