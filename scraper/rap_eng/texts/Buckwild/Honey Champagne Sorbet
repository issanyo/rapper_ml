[Verse 1]
These days I’m thinking different, I’m thinking self-efficient
Still make maneuvers tinted, stock up my status lifted
My life is written cause I wrote it then I got promoted
Pockets exploded, now this whip I drive is candy coated
Electric wrist, I froze it, never see my ship corroded
So gracious when we floating, dog I rock expensive clothing
Low shit, lugging, just Louis sneakers, it’s Gucci
Fuck around you might see me up town rocking a [?]
Like its 98, rhyme great, prime steak, tuna cuts
Scrape em and replace em, never lace em, what we do to sluts
Moving like a [?] and shoes on trucks
G shit, never losing, no confusion, cause my crew is such
General status and scallops on top of cabbages
Move and shaking with packages, [?] our mattresses
Soaking in silk with savages, Wednesday we fucking actresses
Thursday it’s tennis stars, my niggas never rented cars

[Hook]
Crest emblem, pressed at em, connect send em
Stretch Phantom, soak salmon with fresh lemon
Fetch threaten, dyke spending my life sentence
Night legends, write presence and slice tenants
Honey champagne sorbet, gourmet
That’s how I eat, my niggas still fucking with [?]
Honey champagne sorbet, gourmet
That’s how I eat, my niggas still fucking with [?]

[Verse 2]
Lost in luxury, trust in me, I’m legitimate
Absorb the world and bring it right back to my city, kid
All Queens everything, always and forever
If only Itch is present then I cover me with leather
Foam-posites, chrome rockers, grown pockets
Blown profits, flown tropics, gold watches
Hennessy and a [?] cause I’m a drifter
Staring at the sky cause I can see a better picture
Painted by dedication, planted like vegetation
Building and then erasing this part of my education
Covering my tracks like dope fiends with long sleeves
Karma came and left I got my check from [?]
Push buttons starts these days, we never turn keys
Faggot niggas hating, probably wish we served D’s
Might have seen me on gangland, pistol fold
Supervising an initiation ritual

[Hook]
