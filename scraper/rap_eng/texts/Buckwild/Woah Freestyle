I don't have fans I have heaters ♨️♨️
Touchdown on Niggas unnoticed like cheaters 🚷
I was in the game, you was watching in the bleachers
Didn't make to the league and these bars might be the reason 💯
I swear I love you all
And it's coming I'm not teasing
I'm mastering my craft and my shaft Is still increasing ➕
I used to rock dickies and crease em with double creases
With all white ones so clean
No dirt beneath them
So when I hit the dirt
Please tell me what lies beneath him
I'm feeling like Elmer
And I heard it's rabbit season
Forgive me if I'm stuck
I got bread for the ducks
Mighty fine lord hogging roads
Like semi trucks
I just need some bucks coming in
That's income
If law is called balance
Then I need to win some
I'm slim with the body
Murder ink I'm " Riv gotti "
She heard about me
What she seeing it got her doubting
Until It starting raining ☔️
Now I'm drinking out her fountain
Yea, I kick rocks to move mountains
Walking meme I'm a mime, but I got yo bitxh shouting
I been knew you was my son cause when I win you be pouting
You keep saying what you are
I'm just glad that I'm not it
Had to let you know I have it
You afraid cause you got it
I'm the one I'm the one
And I know that I'm bout it
Cherries 🍒 told me you on go
So I'm afraid that I can't stop it
And If trees don't ever fall
We'll hit the mall and I'll cop it
And I need new hobbies
I was thinking bout shopping
Mike wit me, but I ain't talkin bout Scotty
Psycho Sid Pump like shotty
Shawn Don too hot like Scotty
We remixing tell em sorry 😐
Kenny tell em bring the rarri
Wayne change the game
It's our show and we're starring
Number one pick
And I'm chosen
So I'm starting
I'm far from done
So waste your time
Tryna stop me
I'm on face time
Her apple 🍎 watch ⌚️ here
Tryna watch me
💦
