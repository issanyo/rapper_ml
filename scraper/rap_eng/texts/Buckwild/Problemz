[Intro]
Whats going on F baby
Yeah, what's the deal star?
Just maintaining my mind
I heard y'all got to talk to me about something
Say word, we just seen your wifey getting in the whip of this next cat
Man that's shiesty son, I got to cut you off right there, that's just too much love
Yo word to mother son, shorty was doing it all son
I was going to do the same thing back then
So put me on then!

[Verse 1]
Back in the days there was this ho, I knew before I had cash
Down then, brown skin, big titties, fat ass
Until one day, I really started bugging this shit
Niggas was like F, how could you fall in love with this bitch
But come to find out, shorty was a shiesty hoe
She had a nigga really digging, she was wifey though
Find way outta line, with a mind that was mad vicious
I never had riches, so she listen to them crab bitches
And sometimes I think she only fucked with me
'Cause of the way I suck titties and never bust nuts quickly
Not at all thinking weed smoking and alcohol drinking
If honeys lonely, that's probably 'cause she money-hungry

[Hook]
Bitches ain't nothing but problems
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
It's from the spirit, so when you hear these lyrics to sing
Nowadays these honeys all about material things
Bitches ain't nothing but problems
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
But I'ma deal with it and be real with it
And if your ex give you ass, you should still hit it

[Verse 2]
Now you wanna take the time and speak to me
'Cause I be rhyming and shining, frequently
Fake niggas popping most, saying peace to me
These high prize hoes ain't seen at least a G
You ain't the same dime peace that I used to love
Sniffing coke, doing drugs, Gufflin booze with thugs
Fuck a bitch, but this snake shit gotta be known
Plus I couldn't leave the motions of a body alone
I used to try to be nice and never lie to hoes
Now I keep them bitches thinking I'ma buy them clothes
Busting nuts, if not on or near faces, and rear places
Like bathroom floors, halls and stair cases
You was the only one that I was close to
Now act like I ain't supposed to
Violate and expose you, violate and expose you

[Hook]
Bitches ain't nothing but problems
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
It's from the spirit, so when you hear these lyrics to sing
Nowadays these honeys all about material things
Bitches ain't nothing but problems
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
But I'ma deal with it and be real with it
And if your ex give you ass, you should still hit it

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, I don't hate women and all
But I do hate the faggots that's resembling y'all
And to you chicken-head bitches I remember when y'all
Used to had me set tripping, now I never could fall
You could hear that the pussy is the bomb and strong
But I swear on my tear put 2 condoms on
Life is like hell, so I gotta fight this world
No time for hookas, I'm looking for a righteous girl
It's from the spirit, so when you hear the lyrics to sing
Nowadays these honeys, all about material things
You got to be a big willy, or a skitzo thug
Have mad gold chains, or you gets no love
But I'ma deal with it, and be real with it
And if my ex give me ass I'ma still hit it
Because, bitches ain't nothing but problems

[Hook x2]
Bitches ain't nothing but problems
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
It's from the spirit, so when you hear these lyrics to sing
Nowadays these honeys all about material things
Bitches ain't nothing but problems
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
But I'ma deal with it and be real with it
And if your ex give you ass, you should still hit it
