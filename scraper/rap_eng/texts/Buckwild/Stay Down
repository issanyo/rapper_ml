[Chorus]
Follow all the way don't find a way out
How long can you stay down
How long can you stay down, now now
All my life been caught inside the chase now
How long can you stay down
How long can you stay down, now now

[Verse 1]
Conversations with you about God and where I'm going
And talks with God about you and those same topics
Want to buy my mom a summer house off in the tropics where she can worry about the water and not the contents in our wallets
Got some things moving and booming now it has to be major
Skipped on a major been running court the scores in my favor
Knew this was coming since Chapman Hall with the music playing
Only concerned with discussions from what the crew was saying
Like who was playing those records back in the early days
And who was checking me then
While looking back on those hurricanes in my freshman year so thankful when I took the flight
It changed my life when I played my cards and I rolled the dice
I talked to Ethan and told him I think that year was a dream we just got to live and those beats we kept on repeat just might take us above the rim and around the country if not the globe
Those big talks in a small room we just had to grow

[Chorus]
Follow all the way don't find a way out
How long can you stay down
How long can you stay down, now now
All my life been caught inside the chase now
How long can you stay down
How long can you stay down, now now

[Verse 2]
Run it back
Don't ask to see it I'm not done with that
I need that peace of mind that you might be the one for that
Fly out the country got you wondering just where I'm at
And if we're good and if I'm gon' prove it just make it last
Just make it happen and shit the team gon' push it forever
I got my shit together
I got my squad on my jersey from A-T-L to New Jersey I always knew it was worth it they kept me humble and working
Remember searching for purpose back in the day when my only focus was true connection
I guess it still is but now they move when I send a message
I send my best to ones who neglected to find perspective
Or fell off the map when they never figured to check directions
Scared I'm losing all my friends by working this hard
I say I'm working for y'all
But they don't see it like that
Searching for balance between obsession and passion I might be passing the limit I go missing still bring it right back yeah

[Chorus]
Follow all the way don't find a way out
How long can you stay down
How long can you stay down, now now
All my life been caught inside the chase now
How long can you stay down
How long can you stay down, now now
