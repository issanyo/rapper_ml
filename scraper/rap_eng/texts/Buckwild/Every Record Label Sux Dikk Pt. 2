[Intro]
Yo yo, they asked me where the fuck I've been for this time
I've been poor out of my fucking ass
Eating fucking shit fucking ugly bitches
Everybody knows that pretty bitches ain't down the fuck nobody warming shit
But that shit don't even matter
It's all about you faggot ass motherfucking rapid sticking out don't drive and Lexus is and shit like yet and
Every record label sucks dick
But yo, yo, but, but, but you'll be sucking on your record label dick
Word up, just a little something for
Motherfuckers [?] fall off the Earth
You know what I'm sayin'?
[?] in the morning losing my fucking mind about the murder people
Yo yo yo yo, check it out, yo yo yo yo

[Verse 1]
Say snakes in this rap feel fuck the fat do ya
Feel how they're choking on the smoke from the gas fuel
The Rugged Man record label suicide
Move aside (Man, calm down)
Who the fuck you think you are?
I smack that bitch who works the front desk at strictly
Be there for high school credit but sucks picks of all the rap stars
Will be behind bars, 'cuz Mr. Elliot our beds
'Bout to get fucked in his asshole and brother I'm not even gay
Shame, shame, shame
The president of the company don't care if I'm tenerife I'm bleeding
I'm succeeded they took my mind state into evil
'Cuz I want everyone dead on this fucking Earth
It really hurts 'cuz you're here is it doesn't work
I got nothing left to live for expect I get in the programs
Vision bitches hate my fucking guts, those sluts
Love me more than Patrick Swayze when I had my steady income
I need a spot that I can sit for
Suicide never but I got plots are taking out to other people
And I ain't doing jail time that shit is wet
Ain't no coming back once I lose control my sins finishes
Just don't get in this, you record label people
We're gonna die and no family gonna die two motherfuckers

[Hook]
"You ain't gotta tell me no more"

[Outro]
No, that's distant verse one
You can't but this shit is shit is not for sale
That's for the real rap advance, but see real nowadays is just a fucking give me anyway
I'm keeping it real, I'm staying real all the bullshit, yeah
Y'all how the fuck is you supposed to be really you can't rap for real I can't float for real
You got your hip hop styles on and you read them fucking rap magazines I listen to them rap music stations and all the sudden you know what the fuck rap is right
Get the fuck out of my face with that bullshit you faggot motherfuckers
