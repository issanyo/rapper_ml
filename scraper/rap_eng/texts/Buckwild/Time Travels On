[Scratches:]
"Time goes on"

[Hook: Celph Titled]
I can only see the roads I've been down
Been tryin' to move forward in my life for so long now
To seize the day might not ease the pain
But the hourglass never takes a break
Time travels on
Time. Travels. On
"Time goes on"
Time travels on
Time. Travels. On
"Time goes on"
Time travels on

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
As I
Get lost in a cloud of smoke
I just started my day but it ain't your normal hours though
Most of the time that the mic's ripped, I'm on a night shift
Seems to be the only time I write shit
Easier to say, "Seize the day"
They was here yesterday but now they gone away
I hope it ain't lights out
I hope it's something nice on the other side
Even though I spit lyrics that makes mothers cry
Memories fade every minute that pass (by)
But when I'm gone you'll still hear my voice when the song blast (right)
So make the best of your time here
Let your loved ones know that you care
Cause they ain't always gonna be there
Better plant seeds for your future to grow
Don't procrastinate bullshit or move too slow
I used to be depressed about this life of mine but now the clock is my medicine
I get better with time
Time travels on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Majik Most]
I'm thinkin' about my mom
As time travels on
Dead and gone
Died unexpected
Depression, a billion bad thoughts, brain infected
Suffocation, deep contemplation
Just thinkin' and waitin' like she's comin' back
But facts is facts and my heart is black
I'd give up anything for her to be here
Just five minutes
I could whisper in her ear
"I love you" but in my heart you'll always be near (I love you)
Never again will I waste the opportunity
The lunacy (so stupid)
To think for eternity, there will always be
And not just a memory
Don't intend to be too busy for your family
Cause time travels on but this song is a part of me
For you to see
Don't take them for granted
The worst fate is when it's too late to understand it (understand it)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DutchMassive]
This might be
The only chance I have
To tell you that I love you and I'm sorry for the past
Take it or just leave it but I mean it and I'm glad
But it's sad when they misinterpretate how I act
For now, I journey on a separate path
Embrace the memories before my heart is split in half
Though half isn't accurate
Cause every single person on this earth is attached to it
Our journey's passionate
To live life as I imagine it
The time on this earth is so precious
So with each new second I'm alive I'm attackin' it
The fact is that I'm gracious
I'm thankful for life's sudden changes
The struggle, I'm humble and patient
Ashamed that you left cause I'm destined for greatness
