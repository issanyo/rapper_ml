Oh look who I've ended up with some guy named Kon
And he's a serious rapper? Well that's no fun
He's a serious guy but a serious bore
In preschool his favorite show was Serious George
This guy shoots at ice cream trucks and all snack bars
Then robs 'em cause that's what he'd do for a Klondike bar
You think you're insane if you killed a guy you'd weep over their dead body
If you went boom boom blocka hit me with the choppa then you'd just apologize "Oh I'm so sorry!"
Man you said you chopped Roane's body up and put him in the freezer you know just as something to eat
Only thing fucked up about that's you forgot to add ketchup before,"Bon appetit!"
Anyway Kon you know you're pretty damn conceited
I'll leave Kon seated in the chair where the con's seated
You know I think your head's better off with a red hole Kon
Can't body this clever fox you have so soul Kon/Soul Khan
Listen to all these metaphors and similes
Leave all YOUR body parts severed so quickly
Then end with this cat call it Breakfast at Tiffany's
And Kon's just the last kill that lead me to victory
See I don't look like I can spit I look light as a feather
But put me solo against 10 they can die all together
Y'all seen a Hitchcock film? Then you might all remember
Leave the cash on the table and the psycho will enter
And now to close the casket it's good to be a clown but you don't always get what you've wanted Kon
Tried to be a hero ended up like me face the facts you're a comic Kon/Comic Con
Oh wait I almost forgot to add a weird gun bar
Well I got so much metal on me if I only had a heart
