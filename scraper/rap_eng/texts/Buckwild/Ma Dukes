O.C. - “Ma Dukes”
[Emcee(s): O.C.]
[Producer(s): Buckwild]
[Sample 1 (Melody): Jimmy McGriff - “Back on the Track”]
[Sample 2 (Drums): Jeff Beck - “Come Dancing”]

[Verse 1: O.C.]
I say
One for the fam, two for good judgment
Bad luck to trife, good luck to stay above it
Trial and error, O.C.’s out to sever
You gain respect, neglect not to work hard for the
Revenue instead of on the avenue, babbling
I’d rather be accomplishing, making moves, traveling
Insight is right on time—let’s do it
Buck struck again with the disco fluid
I’ll protrude out of your skin like thorns, irritating
Emcees ‘cause they don’t make songs like these
Mister, it’s the man most leased to excel.  A long
Time ago, many thought I’d fall like a domino
No.  Now your face is chump ‘cause I’ve summed up
To something most high, not amounting to a bum

[Verse 2: O.C.]
I’m coming with
Fluent rhythm, calm yet storm
Unleashing my speech to each and every one.  I wake
Up in the morning, get up, then I’m yawning
Glad to be alive to another day’s dawning
Some blessed be otherwise—they despise
‘Cause they can’t handle what’s word from the wise
I don’t stress who I measure up to or who’s fond of O’s
‘Cause what you build, I knock down for my condos
Upon those, those words I speak
More or less, my best, just to say the least.  Foun-
-dation laid.  “What gives?” you ask with
A sass.  Regardless, O.C. lives

[Verse 3: O.C.]
One time, it’s a check-your-life record
Yeah, peep the method—it’s a smooth kind of effort with
Guidelines to put your hand on your chin and think
Ears listen before you say a record ain’t mink
Hard work involves what evolves around O
I try to keep it moderate if that’s how I thought of it
I’ll break beats down, lashing with the voice, choice
Words I’ma say, only spoken when I’m moist.  It’s
A vibe coinciding with the rhythm
Choice words to follow for suckers to swallow
Each one teach.  Strong, not weak, so I’ma
Let mom finish what I started to freak, it’s like...
