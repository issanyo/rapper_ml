[Sample from the TV series Twin Peaks]
"Shut your eyes and you’ll burst into flames!"

[Chorus:]
Visions of bodies bein', visions of bodies bein' burned
Visions of bodies bein', visions of bodies bein' burned
But I ain't goin' out, but I ain't goin' out without a fight
But I ain't goin' out without a fight

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I grab a motherfuckin' whale by the tail fin
Throw it through the sky, hit a jet make it tailspin
Spit straight lava my mouth is a volcano
Crush solid rock in my palm like soft Play-Doh
Travel on tours on the back of a torpedo
Inside of a tornado, you better inform NATO
Gold chains, gold crown, hoes who love to go down
Turn your city block into a ghost town
Real spooky, full of crack addicts with no goals
Well I'm the Grim Reaper pullin' souls through nose holes
Y'all are feminine as phones that are rose gold
Your flows old, already expired and grows mold
I'm so cold I could freeze boilin' water
Boy you oughta deploy a harder track
'Cause I destroy the softer rappers
Swear they trappin' but never ever seen coke
That’s why you catch a contact just walkin' through weed smoke
Fire starter, pyrotechnical technician
You better listen or they'll find you with your head missin'
Certified Pharaoh, find me at Fahrenheit's
Hot enough to disinfect the mic from all you parasites
One verse is hot as the Sun's surface
Hot as a gun burst is, burnin' ya epidermis
In my high school superlatives, said I'm the most murderous
Convertin' this verse into a furnace and start burnin' this

[Chorus:]
Visions of bodies bein', visions of bodies bein' burned
Visions of bodies bein', visions of bodies bein' burned
But I ain't goin' out, but I ain't goin' out without a fight
But I ain't goin' out without a fight

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Fallin' out the sky hit the ground and the earth shakes
I shouldn't even be on this planet in the first place
The son of a god, Krypton is my birthplace
I murder in chronological order by birthdays
'Til every sucker rapper's extinct, I happen to think
Souls of my foes get trapped in my ink
Write flows with the ghosts of the recently deceased
Sound waves I compose are the frequency of the beast
Six hundred and sixty six megahertz a verse
Tour bus is a hearse, and every show's at a church
I deliver the last rites every time I smash mics
Doctor Frankenstein diggin' with flashlights
To suture and stitch, I'm a computer that spits
I'm from the future and we don't listen to Future you bitch
Terminator metamorphin' to liquid metal, a wicked devil
Rippin' several rappers to shreds on a different level
The most high exalted, suckers'll get assaulted
Catapulted off the ground and their body is somersaulted
The sum of all summers, I summon power to alter
My physical form and channel the souls of the greatest authors
I'm Hiawatha, hot as a fire walker
Emergin' from underwater in a fuckin' flyin' saucer
(At night I can’t sleep) I think too deep
So I strike up a match and throw gas on the sheep

[Chorus:]
Visions of bodies bein', visions of bodies bein' burned
Visions of bodies bein', visions of bodies bein' burned
But I ain't goin' out, but I ain't goin' out without a fight
But I ain't goin' out, out without a fight
Burned, burned, burned, bein' burned, burn

[Sample from the film Pink Flamingos]
"Burn you fucker, burn!"
