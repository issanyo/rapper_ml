It's like that y'all, like that

So why they hatin' on Celph Titled?
I don't know, man, I don't know, man
I don't know, man, I don't know, I don't know
Cause they wanna be where I are
Cause they wanna be where I are

So why they hatin' on Celph Titled?
I don't know, man, I don't know, man
I don't know, man, I don't know, I don't know
Cause they wanna be where I are
Cause they wanna be where I are
So why they hatin' on

Star spangled from harsh angles
Bow and arrow arch aimed at your Randy Savage wave cap
Your budget I ate that, I'm the new Pat Sajak
They asked me for a couple letters so my AK spat

Hollow head heat sneakers at your weak features
Like Data from the Goonies with unique sneakers
I'm a slide past wack shit with highly extensive
Combat shit on compact disk

Don't worry if I'm burning your album
Cause if I'm burning your album
I'm in the backyard burning the album

Smokey The Bear will have to choke on a flare
Am I supposed to be scared?
That's like Vin Diesel combing his hair

Ain't happenin' now, no, not, not forever
Not a rapper with a better flow, what so ever
All these biters ride my nuts like a road rail
They wish I had seat belts embedded in my coat tails

I don't know, man, I don't know, man
I don't know, man, I don't know, I don't know
Cause they wanna be where I are
Cause they wanna be where I are

So why they hatin' on Celph Titled?

I first appeared on wax in '98, as a young teen
Now I'm stackin' paper, got my thumb green
How many times am I fresh? That's umpteen
Get dirty, pull the trigger, but I keep my gun clean

That's sparkly shinin', yeah, the glittery bling
Vocals so big, the Pro-Tools need a 50 inch screen
Hardcore rhymes, jazz riffs and loops
I think y'all forgot what rap sounded like, didn't you?

Let me remind you of a time way back
When hip hop tracks had hard snares and not lame snaps
Rappers where rappers, drug dealers were dealers
Fans was just fans and the music was much realer

Now it's a clown show
Except these fagots got a dope boy persona
Instead of the damn clown nose
I laugh at any critic saying my style is too humorous
Cause you're an insecure boy with an abused uterus

I don't know, man, I don't know, man
I don't know, man, I don't know, I don't know
Cause they wanna be where I are
Cause they wanna be where I are

So why they hatin' on Celph Titled?
I don't know, man, I don't know, man
I don't know, man, I don't know, I don't know
Cause they wanna be where I are
Cause they wanna be where I are
So why they hatin' on

I get slept on heavily
But I'm an expert with rap whether it be Heavy D or Heather B
I've heard all the beats, all the cuts, all the breaks
All the flow from all the legends in cities, state to state

I'm an ace when I study the science of spit
Respect my skill for the one of a kind that it is
Put behind all the early shit you heard of mine
That was before I flipped and decided it was murder time

I stepped my game up, my cadence is impeccable
Lyrics are out of this world, swagger is incredible
And if you can't see that then you're probably a rapper yourself
Wishin' you could be where I'm at

Don't you herbs notice? You can't disturb my focus
My words are so sick that they leave you with tuberculosis
If your CD has 15 songs
Word is born it's about 15 songs too long

Just give me my fuckin' phone call
