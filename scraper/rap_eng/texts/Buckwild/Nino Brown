The world, Brooklyn to the day I die
Coming to the pen wearing green, show
Now I feel bigger than nino
Champagne days of patron nights
God help me, I’ve been up the past 5 nights
Caught up in the hype and I’m still clubbing
Bands hanging acting out while we’re in the public
You see me still ….gotta love…surviving
Cause I done made a … and not a bread crumbs
Eddie told me stay focus watch the bread come
Proof that anything is possible
Standing in the phantom screaming I’m unstoppable
Shooting for the stars dog, feels like I landed on Mars dog

Still living like I have no fear, middle finger’s in the air like yeah
It’s about to go down, look at me, bigger than Nino Brown
I’m bigger than Nino Brown, I’m bigger than Nino Brown
The realest realest in the town, look at me, bigger than Nino Brown

I’m everything the little homies wanna be
Magazines, I’m a young girl’s fantasy
Doing things that the og’s never dream
Seeing things that my dead friends never seen
Different night, different girls, new city
Man the whole world is a new jack city
From crack money to that Puff Daddy jury
Foreign cars got a good broad with me
So this is for my dawgs in the war zone
Still banging… in the group holes…
Ex con, tell the truth, who’d you thought I be?
I’m standing on sand that’s Caribbean
Penthouse sweet just me and some 2 women friends
Look at me, seen expectation, still don’t give no fuck with no explanation

Still living like I have no fear, middle finger’s in the air like yeah
It’s about to go down, look at me, bigger than Nino Brown
I’m bigger than Nino Brown, I’m bigger than Nino Brown
The realest realest in the town, look at me, bigger than Nino Brown

Yeah, the realest, realest, in the country
Any hood, just look at how they love me
From the top to the bottom where them thugs be
Bullet proof confidence, haters can’t touch me
If I ain’t loosing then I gotta be a winner
Threesomes for breakfast, my young girl for dinner
Lord please, forgive me I’m a sinner
Got the spirit of a old drug dealer
Feeling like I’m the king of the whole block
Now I park … on my own block
Look around, this is Maino’s town
I’m bigger than Nino Brown

Still living like I have no fear, middle finger’s in the air like yeah
It’s about to go down, look at me, bigger than Nino Brown
I’m bigger than Nino Brown, I’m bigger than Nino Brown
The realest realest in the town, look at me, bigger than Nino Brown
