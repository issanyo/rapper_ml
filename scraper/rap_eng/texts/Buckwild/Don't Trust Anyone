[Hook]
Don't trust anyone
(Ain't no one we can trust)

[Verse 1]
I wanna take it from star's and scrapes by high bars and gates
To stars and papes, hungry niggas that starve relate
Money-getters sniffing yards of yay
Honey-hitters getting charged all day
R.I.P. to B.I.G and Marvin Gaye, cause life's beyond critical
So I can't be seen wich means I'm non-visible
Son your aim with a firearm's pitiful, you hit the wrong man
And left his moms miserable, criminals using this moment to show
What we distributing is potent
My ludicrous slogans be having shortie's uterus open
I keep my pay collected and stay connected to get niggas
To play my record and my name respected is the main objective
I'm leaving foes crushed with no points on a doughnut
I'm so nuts niggas that play heroes I give em cold cuts
Adolescents packing Wessons with solid crack professions
He die from the mack's agression instead a black depression

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Well if you thinking what I said was soft, once the lead bust off
I'll have you running like a chicken with his head cut off
You're number one opponent, make sure them guns is loaded
Before you find your sons extorted and unsupported
If I'm not firing, I'm getting higher than
Mothafuckas is better off retiring and playing violins
Or idling, you're admiring my style cause it's quite vicious
Smack bitches like niggas smack niggas like bitches
Doing time for crime they facing, now your mind is wasted
For tryna shine with diamond bracelets
Mad flavour, the bag lacer, take a pull of this
Shit have you feeling like a dragracer
Notice me, you ain't supposed to be attacking
It global and locally I mastered it, lyrics is vocally immaculate
Niggas is totally inaccurate, packing iron for wreck
A lotta these brothers is dying bets
But son, imagine having lions for pets
Smoking cess, fucking any bitch you try to sex
I'm thinking long term, more than just bying a Lex
I want the livest connect with each man in my fam high as the next
