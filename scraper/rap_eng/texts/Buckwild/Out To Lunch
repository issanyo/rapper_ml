[Sample-Looped Hook] [x2]
"Dem no like me and me no like dem
Dem a me enemy, me an dem no friend"
[Scratch Hook] [x2]
"Ready to smack the dog shit outta them"
[Vocal Sample]
"Demolish and polish (Who?) God damn!"

[Verse One: Celph Titled]
(Fannn-fuckin-tastic), crashin' thru ya wall like The Kool-Aid Man
The suit cost eight grand
Murderous clans that grabbed purses and ran
Ain't shit cause with bare hands I disassemble conversion vans
My Hell's Wind Staff blows limbs back
I won't spit tracks with wick-wack cliques that come with less than ten stacks
Yeah the price went up, bakin' cupcakes
And if I told you what was in 'em you would probably throw the icing up
Hyphen-fuck-slash, you kickin' that Balderdash
This is how you 'sposed to rap, I'm where you should focus at
Chicka-chicka-check, me and Trigga Treach
Triple the torture, torch ya when you intercept a Intratec
Intercept text messages, collect "Evidence"
Like a Dilated Peoples box set, get upset, turn ya top red
I'm a hot head, swing a rock in a sock net
Cop the Swisher from Achmed, let the Glock spread
Put you in a box dead, carnivore, half animal
Acupuncture treatments from the splinters in my axe handle
Blast ammmo when I mash out
Cause when I lash out, I rip eye lashes out

[Sample-Looped Hook] [x2]
"Dem no like me and me no like dem
Dem a me enemy, me an dem no friend"
[Scratch Hook] [x2]
"Ready to smack the dog shit outta them"
[Vocal Sample]
"God damn!"

[Verse Two: Treach]
Trigga Treach...
Known for rippin' the raps, grippin' the gats, nippin' ya naps
Fuck around and get kidnapped, slip and get slapped
You'll be worth a handsome ransom, tied in the camper
By some hip hop Black Panthers from Tampa
Puttin' paws to ya jaws, how ya feel now?
Plus you know we throw that steel 'round in Illtown
Pil-pow, nigga-naps, nuh-Naughty style
Watch ya turn the strippers 'round the .40 cal
Gritty pile, plenty stacks, 60 pounds
Handin' out my mini-Mac, 50 rounds
A negro without an ego, desert eagle stay low
You play bro and be spinnin' in the air like a tornado
NATO, couldn't save ya, pray a minute, pause
Ya gone now thanks to Treach and The Demigodz
These demographics are drastic, ya bastard
Mastered the ass-kiss, show ya ass and get smacked quick

[Sample-Looped Hook] [x2]
"Dem no like me and me no like dem
Dem a me enemy, me an dem no friend"
[Scratch Hook] [x2]
"Ready to smack the dog shit outta them"
[Vocal Sample]
"To come exact with the stupified rap"

[Verse Three: Celph Titled]
Sneak attack entourage, barrage of shooters on deck
That move with a set, pull a tool in a sec, imagine what we do to ya rep
(I'm sayin') dissect with a chainsaw, not a Katana blade
My problems make the common state of your heart rate complicate
The voice of god, colder than a oyster bar
The boy been hard, like Hasselhoff hoistin' Deutsche Marks
For Naughty fanatics I'm bringin' Ali Baba back
Holy magician bringin' that Dalai Lama rap
Send bengals who will mangle you
Leave you in the wild I'll serve you as bengal food
Aim and shoot, with every word that we speak
Tell 'em Treach we gon'
[Treach:]
Smack 'em, call 'em burgundy cheeks
Biatch!
