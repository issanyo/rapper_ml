[Hook: Kiya Lacey]
You give me all that I need
Nothing can hold me back, you say
I will always be here
And I ain't ever givin' up
You give me all that I need
Nothing can hold me back, you say
I will always be here
And I ain't ever givin' up

[Verse 1: Matt Citron]
I guess these memories been gettin' to me
I learned my lesson 'bout reminiscing
I miss it too much but love when you tell it to me
Walkin' down Broadway to Houston cause I'm recording
Still workin' on lucid dreams, now I'm lookin' back and it's gorgeous
But still, it's gettin' hard to visit places we used to
And all this newfound attention is cool but hard to get used to
Wish I could take a few nights that we didn't grippin'
The moment back for a visit I make em' last for a day or two
Things I would say to you, not tryin' to play it cool
Ask me what I was thinkin', the only thing I would say is you
How'd I turn twenty-two? Swear I was seventeen yesterday
Writin' raps on the bus and rockin' that red and blue fitted cap
Now it's fitted and all these feelings that I've written

[Hook: Kiya Lacey]
You give me all that I need
Nothing can hold me back, you say
I will always be here
And I ain't ever givin' up
You give me all that I need
Nothing can hold me back, you say
I will always be here
And I ain't ever givin' up

[Verse 2: Matt Citron]

[Hook: Kiya Lacey]
You give me all that I need
Nothing can hold me back, you say
I will always be here
And I ain't ever givin' up
You give me all that I need
Nothing can hold me back, you say
I will always be here
And I ain't ever givin' up

[Outro: Kiya Lacey ]
Yeah yeah
I ain't ever givin' up (no)
I said, "You give me all that I need
Nothing can hold me back, you say"
