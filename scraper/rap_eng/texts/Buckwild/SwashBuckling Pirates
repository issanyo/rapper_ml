From the depths of hell I rise high in the sunlight
Gripping my lung tight, sipping some rum this one night
This dumb dyke, keep pulling my heart, she disconnected veins
Think Eye see in vain, but this miss connected brains
I'm in regret, in sane thoughts out the memory
Thinking back to that fat sack we smoked of remedy
Aborting all the tendencies that keep alive my enemies
Stop bending me, I'm head scoping like Kennedy
Informed with lies and pretend to be, another fucking friend of me
Energy is sick when i soak cunts
Get off that dope stuff, acting like you toke blunts
Wouldn't be a broke slut, if you didn't do coke much..
You ain't seen the brain, until I've blown up on you
Found my temper then I lost it, it's nothing new
Huffing glue, addicted to caffeine since a rap fiend
Chase dreams cuz it's all that makes me happy, BLAST ME
