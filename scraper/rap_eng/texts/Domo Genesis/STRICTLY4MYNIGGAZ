[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Biatch!
Uh, yo

[Verse 1]
I spit a racial slur honkey sue me
This is my horror flick
So the black guy doesn't die in my movie
Drunk, high and kinda unruly it's yours truly
Automatics load my words like they flying out of a Uzi
From the boonies, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Where they either wash you away or they dockin' your pay
I'm not with the play
I'm feelin' like Pac in a way
Cause shorty wanna be a thug I'm on the block to this day
I keep smokin' to the face they say the weed got me crazy
And I been dealin' with Wallace and living lately
I don't know if honestly God is gon' wanna save me
All that bad karma I don't wanna have no baby
See I've been thriving between heaven and hell
In the system niggas destined to fail
I make mistakes and learn my lessons as well
But the police want me to rest in a cell
All cause I'm black I'm startin' to question myself
But a young live nigga when it's speaking on the trigga
We ain't scared mothafuckas you don't really want it with us
Young live nigga when it's speaking on the trigga
We ain't scared mothafucka you don't really want it with us, uh

[Hook]
(Fuck how y'all niggas feel)
Y'all niggas don't want it with me, I said
(Fuck how y'all niggas feel)
Y'all niggas don't want it with me, uh

[Verse 2]
They don't wanna see me winnin' cause my skin tone
Devil got us drinking out of the water My mind been gone
In this gang known to be a player get my limp on
Evil chasing me gon' catch me dancin' in the end zone
Feel like somebody watchin'
Sure there's someone recording me
Government tellin' us lies used to act accordingly
Swear to God you niggas and your ignorance annoyin' me
There's more to see
Bringin' out the shell that's what's important G
They keep a nigga timid
Only visions of the limelight
Cause nothin' screams danger like a nigga with his mind right
Takin' my pictures bro what you doin' for your klondike
Your heart in conditions you ain't equippin' for this prime right
Tell me lord somebody come and get me
Wait on what I'm livin' for
Wanna talk to God but I feel like my prayers get ignored
Ballin' cause I speak it on the trigga
A young live nigga you don't really want it with us what up

[Hook]

[Outro]
If you ain't down with that, shut yo god damn ass up
