[Intro]
Smokin' weed, smokin'
Ahh baby, smokin'

[Verse 1]
Man, this shit been such a facade lately
I don't know what to tell y'all (It's a facade)
Niggas fugazi tryna run them plates by me and I be like hell naw
Back up with that pressure, best to let a nigga breathe
I'm probably on some level you niggas never believe
And no, I never left 'em, always kept a trigger but a sleeve
And you can find me

[Chorus]
I be out here smokin' weed (Smokin', smokin')
Yeah (Smokin')
And you can find me
Smokin' weed (Smokin', smokin')
I be out here smoking weed

[Verse 2]
I'm like Jesus, would you save me please?
'Cause all these niggas make believe, like I love getting paid
But it ain't great as how you make it seem
'Cause you know what that paper bring
Kelly envy friends and family, and that's a dangerous thing
I used to have swag when I was broke and I ain't change a thing
But you know them bathing apes is clean
I might wear a whole different outfit with the same jeans, I'm still a hunnit

[Hook]
Smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed (Smokin')
I be out here smokin' weed (Smokin')
I be out here smokin' weed (Yeah, yeah)
I be out here smokin' weed (Smokin' weed)
Smokin' weed

[Verse 3]
I'ma leave these haters on some mad shit
'Cause I'ma start acting like I ain't had shit (What else?)
All of this fakin', I'm not passionate
Now I'm giving the whole world my ass to kiss
When I was fumbling with my last trip of sanity, y'all ain't have a hand for me
I hit you with that "Sorry, I was busy, couldn't answer, B"
Petty betty business shit, I'm already in it
And I can't let a nigga put a stain on my image
Like Vontae Davis, I'ma go and leave you niggas to finish
Plus I can't let you eat up all of my anytime minutes

[Outro]
Smokin' weed
And I be high when you find me
I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed (Yo, yo, yo)
I be out here smokin' weed
And I be high when you find me
I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed
See, I be out here smokin' weed
I be out here smokin' weed
I'm out here smokin' weed
