[Intro]
Good sense, Good sense

[Verse 1]
How dem young boys killing I think that’s ludacris
Since a juvenile I've been moving shit
Was raised bumping lil wayne and boosie them
I'm tryna stay sane I'm this close to losing it
All I had was old girl and my basketball
Granny lit them candles when the lights was off
Came a long way from riding on them handlebars
Now I dive in my money nigga cannon ball
But money and family that’s all I care about
I turn my mama crib into a marriott
Niggas trapped all day just to get bailed out
Too hood to be hollywood I'm no sell out
I used to keep a burner in the mailbox
My homie got shot and now he shell shocked
I pray that all my niggas ball hard
I pray that we never fall off
This lil nigga turn big dog
Took me no days off to get them bricks off
Yeah, get money that’s my theme song
We fuss back and forth like it’s ping pong
I shine bright without no bling on
I kiss my son before I leave home
And the moral of the story is
Without no guts ain’t no glory kid

So last night yo, I'm in the bricks
Lil nigga walk up to me like
Smizz can I tell you my story

[Verse 2]
It’s politics as usual
Coming up as a unusual child
Shit my childhood I chose not to smile
Confused with real life for a while
Didn’t know if I was pose to live life
Or pose to style
See some days I miss meals
On chill nights my stomach growls
Said I went to school just to eat dinner
Chicken swab but coming from can
I learn to be a winner
If you get caught slipping become the next nigga’s child
Blah, that’s the sound of the forty cal
Another one bites the dust some hood niggas doing for fun
I didn’t even try to run I stuck on my chest
My eyes wide somebody told me gangsters don’t die
They multiply, shit they lied
I got my religion from watching guys like godfather
With mob ties, niggas that flip pies
Niggas that pimp rides niggas that’s known for keeping bad bitches by they side
But I never had that, all I had was a pack to pay society back
Soon as I bought my first gack
Grew up in the eighty so my mom was on crack
A single parent lady who’s addiction was so [?]
But to make the situation more shady
My partner told me that [?] was pregnant with my baby
That was my main lady
So now I'm dealing with stress and a baby mamy shit
All I wanted was to go to college and get a scholarship
But fuck it I said I'm on that robbing shit
Brought me two black [?] now I'm a wildcat like wonder wiz
I used to dream about being like them Obamy kids
But it’s fucked up I couldn’t even tell you who my real father is

Good sense, Good sense

[Verse 3]
Mobbing with my brothers from another go and get it
Son  say the word and I'm with it
Lawns full of herb liquor on the curb
Rest in peace AJ pose to be here spitting
Look, I'm pose to be winning
Look, shit post to be different
But I swear it’s looking good this year
Bye baby, don’t cry for me watch me ride these beats
Ride out bitch you ain’t never ride for me
Talk is cheap and this dick ain’t free
Fuck off fell off and I'm back on
'Cause had to sit down for three nights back home
Used to play the corner for real from the field to the block
Push your nose you got pushed in that box
Jock put up you know it’s up nigga
Hooked to that money that shit a drug nigga
Fuck these other niggas I don’t fuck with em
Just me and my niggas now you stuck with us
Since way back when they couldn’t fuck with us
Hating nothing changed they can’t fuck with us
Come to your hood to fuck a bitch
You know they love them niggas from the lanta (Atlanta)
Old heads really with the shit
A few dead bodies on the hammer
Jeff had the swag we all stole from it
Stack a lil' paper make more money
Never no money can’t go back to that
Grind till the line go flat
Write rhymes the flow’s stupid
I got dumb and lose my mind
Honey I'm home count this cash
Good bye to my past
