Merry Christmas, everybody
Quit hating

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (oh, the session open fire)
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (get off my nose, Jack Frost)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir (sing them, girls)
And folks dressed up like Eskimos (I love it)

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (and some mac and cheese and greens and yams)
Help to make this season bright (Good Lord)
Tiny tots (with what?)
With their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight (never good)

They know that Santa's on his way (yes, he is)
He's loaded lots of toys up on that sleigh (woo!)
And every mother's child is 'bout to spy (on what?)
To see if them reindeer really know how to fly (hope you know they do)

And so I'm offering this simple phrase (and what's that?)
To kids from one to ninety-two (that's a lot of kids, a lot of kids)
Although it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Yeah, play them keys
Oh, man
I love them keys
Woo!
Y'all feel the spirit in your chest?
Can you feel the Christmas spirit in your chest?
'Cause I can feel it in mines

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
I know it's been said many times and many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you

Wow, killed it
Jesus Christ
