[Verse 1]
Living by my limits baby not on these laws
I don't need much but damn I want it all
Got some issues that can never get resolved
They show me this image I knew I'd get involved
Like how much time in a day?
'Cause I ain't left college to smoke, Momma promise a way
Man to be honest ain't no options y'all got dollars to pay
And if it ain't about the big scrape: I'm not on my way
Take me out of this game, I need patience
I just need something tougher than hood famous
Something other than hood boogers
Tasting sugar is good ain't it
Another chip from these wood blocks ain't gettin' tanted
It's fucked up when they sleepin' on you're feelings
And the picture that you scripted way more vivid than these nigga's paintin'
A fucked feeling when you focused in on women
But you're shoe short just a jump shot from drug slagin'
Stay in your lane man, I know the pain
All you go through so they can know you're name
Hand you a rope to hang, and tell you jump
Now I'm just tryna stay afloat again
Shit I still remember way before the paper
Before I had a favour, 'fore it waved up
Was tying durags over my taper
It was: the preparation of this player
Catching these feelin's before I knew them shits was rare
I was just another nigga blowing kush up in the air
Rollin' dice and still aware that this crack game is unfair
So what's the point?
I guess it's for the thrill
My intentions wasn't dirty I was caught in the pill
I was writing 'bout this game, I dogde-balled it for real
I love that shit but way too smart to have my heart in the steal
Before me dreamin' even mattered, I was scheming so ellaborate
Couple place to feed right now, man I can't be no fucking rapper
Are you kidding me?
Them hopes were literally flat
I couldn't see it from my angle, man that picture was black
It's kodak
I seen so many niggas get it, where the fuck I go at?
It's pre-written you supposed to know that
