[Verse 1]
I dare you niggas, try to sleep through this
This shit is so raw, I might not have my engine EQ it
I pen the poison and these lethals might just bleed through it
Like Drumline when Nick couldn't read the sheet music
Talent unadulterated, the face of danger get exfoliated
I'm super thuggin', word to Noreaga
Liver than the days my uncle used to let me sport his pager
I dream of faster lives and waking with enormous paper
It's just the days of our lives, hate fueling fam
I'm feeling full, faith in my pride
Long race, slow pace, I'm cool, patient with time
Stay graceful, although when I'm embracing my high
Ya'll don't relate to my mind, I can't call it fam
All you niggas soft,  I ain't ballin' with no Juwanna Mann
Hardest in the paint, what I'm drawing is such a flawless plan
Wrote me in my pain when I'm talking, I got my heart in hand
Rain falling, man

[Hook]
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
And even though things seem strange
I only go outside in the rain
Where I stole, I fueled and I gained
I wanna play in the rain, in the rain
And even though things seem strange
I only go outside in the rain
Where I stole, I fueled and I gained
I wanna play in the rain, in the rain

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
I ain't skipping the beat until my mission complete
Why every rapper sounding like a poor rendition to me?
Sometimes I think like, "Do you really want the crown nigga?"
I had to separate, don't like being around niggas, except my niggas I went to New York, was on TV for like 5 minutes
It's my time, listen, I got prime vision, seeing shit clear now
Plan this year and the next year out
I said, fuck the industry, I'm 'bout loyalty
Rap like Jesus anointed me, second, I see no point to be
Praying for direction, I guess this is where he pointing me
So I'mma run the game for the next ten summers
We ain't ever had nothing, had to get it by ourselves
Was a dream just for me to have my CD on the shelves
Especially without a deal, especially without your cosign
Knowing in my head like, I'mma make it the whole time
Just to believe and speak my dreams into reality
The tale of two cities, can you see the dualities?
The parallel lines of living my rhymes?
The qualities that I possess, it's just a matter of time

[Hook]
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
I wanna go outside, go outside
And even though things seem strange
I only go outside in the rain
Where I stole, I fueled and I gained
I wanna play in the rain, in the rain
And even though things seem strange
I only go outside in the rain
Where I stole, I fueled and I gained
I wanna play in the rain, in the rain
