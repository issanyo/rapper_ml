[Intro]
But what that is?
Good Sense
Believe that

[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
Really was 16 when I bought my first whip though
I really had a semi on my hip though
I really had 16 in that clip though
That's for them nosy niggas who be dying for some info
Fuck my high school coach he had me on the bench though
Knowing I was that nigga man he know a nigga been dope
Can't hide the scars that show you what I been through
Flexing on every track word to Kimbo
Plotting on a mil' staring out this window
And on my block you smell that endo when the wind blow
Or see them young boys wheelie on they bicycle
Or see them young boys flexing in a rock rental
Shots ring another nigga in the hospital
You better do the getting, or you get got nigga
I guess the saga continue
The same bullshit a nigga uncle done been through
Smizz, them niggas can't do what we did
Get outta line then its off with his wig, bla
Hey but what that is?
Believe that

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Looking for me I'm probably chilling
Smoking something wicked thinking about a million
My uncle called me from the box and said I gotta kill it
And I just told him I'm gonna make up for the time he sitting
I'm real smart, know them banks may back fall
Keep a couple racks safe buried in the backyard
Next to the rusty clapper guarded by attack dogs
Call us on the [?] let's take a bet I never slack off ever yet
Neverless I'm at your neck like a sweater vest
Fam I give em pressure 'til they settle debts
[?] my shit in def I'm too real they gotta cut a check
Standing where you buckled I ain't budging gotta come correct nigga
Make a lot of money but we want respect nigga
From a nothing to it all what do you expect nigga
City on my back like a Jansport
I'm only getting what I stand for nigga

[Verse 3: Young Roddy]
Life
Kicks all fucked up from walking in this flood water
Yeah, they got me feeling like tre young boys in the hood with this blood on me
Yeah, they keep it real man I'm trying to give hope I ain't trying to be the plug nigga
Yeah, but everybody like "fuck everybody" damn I'm like where the love nigga
Clean nigga though I got it out the mud nigga
And here's a message to them fuck niggas
Tell 'em I ain't never gave a fuck, nigga
I'm from a city where them boys will lay you down like a rug nigga
Feeling like a diamond in the rough nigga
Hell nah I ain't got, I can't judge niggas
No, I tour the world with a 38 snub nose
Niggas shooting choppas like a drum roll
Cold killas they'll bring it to your front door
Block a nigga's shine like Mutumbo
Yeah, I'm trapped in the hood trying to make an escape
They ask do I got what it take to be great
Hell yeah, as I take another shot to the face
That's like saying Kobe can't hit a fadeaway
I drop another bomb nigga, mayday
I'm trying to hit the lotto like [?]
I promise my girl we take a vay-cay
Running this shit no relay
A nigga trying to shine for the DJ
I'm trying to eat cake like every day my B-day
Trapped in the hood trying to may an escape
They ask do I got what it take to be great
Hey, but what that is?
Believe that
