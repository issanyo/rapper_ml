[Verse 1]
I'mma fall through right after this interview
You should call your bitches up, cause I'mma bring my niggas through
We can kick it, baby, if it's good with you
I'm tryna get high, I can bring in like a zip or two
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
Ain't tryna fuck nothing up, nah, we just kicking it

[Verse 2]
My nigga Jason got cases of light liquor
From last night, if you and your girls act right
We can all get a little tipsy
I mean, we ain't gotta do nothing risky, we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
No need for tripping, we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we be kicking it, we just kicking it

[Verse 3]
You're finger signaling, I'm listening
Leap through the kitchen to a room I fall victim in
Before the gameplay, we do a little scrimmaging
No love involved, she know niggas just kicking it
Yeah, she know that we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
She ain't tripping, we just kicking it
That's how it, when uh, when we kicking it

[Verse 4]
She not a groupie, not a ho, she just a fan
Whose boundaries are crossed simply because I'm the man
And for a single night, she pretends that I'm her man
And ended disappointed, when I'm outtie when it ends
Cause that's how it gets when we just kicking it
That's not my bitch, no we just kicking it
No need to trip cause we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it, we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
Salute me gang apprentice-ship, where you can't get no membership

[Outro]
Yeah, Genesis, Rolling Papers, nigga
(He look like he ain't got no stroke, that nigga is wack
(Yeah, I can't fuck with that, fuck you! Fuck him!)
