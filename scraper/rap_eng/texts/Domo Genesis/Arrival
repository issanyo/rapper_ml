[Verse]
Dear Lord, forgive me for all my transgressions
I raise hell until it's heaven
True essence, everything to prove, but it's been a movie since dude stepped in
My crew wrecking, we could give a fuck 'bout who's second
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers
A push it on the table, don't bring your body to dinner
Just trying to get this money, whole touring throughout the Spring
How we cold all summer and sizzle throughout the winter
Goddamnit, I'm a winner
My uncle left a piece behind
A lost nigga, though I'm searching for a piece of mind
I'm taking yours to add on to this piece of mine
I really think ambition should be redefined
How melodic is the physical embodiment
My soul obvious, stay atop the column and body shit
Fearing nothing, concern is moderate
School of hardknocks and this bitch on full scholarship
Fuck it, feel free to hate on me
I just told the fucking world to hold up, wait on me
Understand that it's the same old G
Blaze more tree, burning up such a fire and remain low key
I'm the one, they told me they was waiting for the revolution
And I arrived and on that day they made a resolution
All the worn down hope came to restitution
The game need a saving, and I was blessed to do it
Collecting my respect cause now it's overdoing
I'ma get this motor on the go before my moment's ruined
The old heads say that I'm a golden student
And I just build my troubles into soulful music
