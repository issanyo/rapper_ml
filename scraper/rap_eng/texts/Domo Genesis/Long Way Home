[Verse 1]
I don't wanna come off too strong
But this a hit and run I take my damage and move on
I feel like in my heart I'm unconditioned to do wrong
Feel like I'm connected like
Feel like I'm just seeing the same visions when I'm -
Painkillers in my bed at night
Looking at the signs hope I read them right
Praying for the chance to get ahead of life
Praying for these flaws that we all got
I ain't finna never let the bar drop
Push against the pressure no bar spot
Always been a rock in a hard spot
In my archive filled with all drive
Like I'm on a car lot
Promise I'mma ball out
No back yard let my dawgs out
Bet I work hard and never call out
Hoping that my engine never stall out
Cause I'm heading home on the far route

[Break]
And I'ma take the long way home, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Weighing up the world ain't shit, nah
Triple check the way I press it up like, uh
Dancing to the tune of my own drum
Wait until I get mines right
I'mma never look back
Go some dumb nowadays I chuck up the deuce
I don't fuck up the juice
Ain't tryna shake hands, showing fake love
I done played it safe for too long
I done saved face for too long
I done lived racism and now they playing cases too strong
I just can't take it too long
But I'mma jump back to the basics
I'mma stay strapped for the hatred
I'mma cut back with a passion of paces
Just another young black trapped in the matrix
But they can't capture or cage us
I'm way too anxious to fly
Swerving through lanes in my ride
View the whole world through my all seeing eyes
Through the graces of God
And I got faith on my side
I'mma stay blazed for the ride

[Outro]
Imma take the long way home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Long way, long way, long way yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Long way, long way yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Long way long home
