Now if I see it in my dreams
Is it for real? Somebody tell me what it means
Sometimes it ain't really what it seems
Cause this could all really be a dream
Is it a dream? Is it a dream?
Am I living what I'm seeing in my sleep?
Or is my imagination tripping off some weed?
Is this all the shit I really need?
In my dream, is this a dream?
Will my dreams make it past here?
Or will I always try to do better than last year?
I'm not afraid of what the future brings
But this a dream, a vivid dream, it's in my dreams
I already see it in my dreams
