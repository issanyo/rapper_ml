[Verse 1: Evidence]
Too much co-sign gon' get you killed
Corporate politics among us [?] top [?]
Nothing safe then, tip-toe to save your reputation
Shit's weak but I admire admiration
And I know men reminds me find my pen
'Cause writing, killing, typing for designing with blends
Hopping, smoking like the smokes that's poking out the ocean
Magic potion, wizard hat, cloak is open
Deliver that on the dot
Begginers wait for they dinner
But the winners are not, shit I been winning a lot
Rap circles, technical is defiently dead to me
Saying all these syllables and hearing nothing said to me
I used to get upset when the melody is stuck in my head
Repetition while I'm climbing in bed
I'm a danger to myself when I'm not at my best
So Ima get some rest, pass her off to brother Stan

[Outro]
And now: back to your regularly scheduled programme
Ayo Domo bring your ass over here man
Kick some of that old bullshit you be talking about
