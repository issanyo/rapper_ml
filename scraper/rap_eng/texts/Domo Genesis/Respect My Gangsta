[Intro]
Oooooh
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I was with my bitch
We was in the club
I bought her a drink
Then touched her butt
She said "Don't touch me"
I said "Girl you trippin'
I bought you a drink, you better listen
Don't be disrespecting me in public
Girl, don't do that shit
Because I'm crazy and I might slap you
In front of all of your fucking friends"

[Hook]
Girl, respect my gangsta
Girl, respect my gangsta
Girl, respect my gangsta
Girl, respect my gangsta
Respect my gangsta
Girl, respect my gangsta

[Verse 2]
Girl, tell your friends that I slapped you
And they gon' call the police
And when they come to my house, I'm just gone tonight
I didn't do it bitch, that was your mother too
I can't understand why you wanna do this
Do this thing to us
You better be respecting my gangsta
Respect my gangsta

[Outro]
