[Verse 1]
Now as time moves on and my clout gets bigger
How manny bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Iphone full of missed calls from this sick broad
Only fucked once, she complaining how she miss dog
Bitch chill there ain't nobody tripping over here
Appeared to have feelings watch me make them feelings disappear
Yeah, the magicians here, just kicking it
I'm sick with this pimping shit playing hoes ridiculous
I ain't got love for them only 'bout the grind
It's hunger on my heart and desire on my line
These other smoke behind, must beating through the fast lane
She pipe blowing no rice throwing keep your last name
I let you hit the weed, what else could you really need
You high and delirious telling me, you can't breathe
When you're without me, you don't know how you should be
That's the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese

[Hook]
Thats the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese
And bitches under my sleeve, yup, tryna smoke my weed up
Reefer, that's what I'm talking 'bout
Sativa, Indica, you need to listen to me
Little girl, you acting so basic (Bitch)
I'm tired of your payless ass
You need to cop some Asics, you basic (Bitch)
You need a mothafuckin' facelift, I like 'em classic, dinosaur Jurassic

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Same old, same old, bitch you's a lame old
You're not the pot of gold to be at the end of a rainbow
It's Ludacris abusiveness, I ain't got time
I'm busy on my music shit, is Nike tryna do this shit?
Hodgy back to prove this shit and watch the bank approve the snitch
With big checks in 'em, recognize a pro, he bring the vets with 'em
Respect the vibe of hoes countering long neck syndrome
Average is basic, day five well day six
Different day, same shit, my high speaks my language
Articular terminology, follow me or swallow me
Shallow me, blow these basics off
Like kush Cali weed, basic meaning basic salary
Face lift over exceeding calories, instead of weight watchers
She getting donuts from Valerie's, colors flux from mood rings
Now she ain't happy, the hood rat come out
And the weave gets nappy, Hodgy leaving this ratch
