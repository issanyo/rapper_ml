[Hook]
Still smoking on that, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Promised God I'd never work at a 9 to 5
I swear I'll find a better worth for why I am I alive
It's about time that I'm seeing my stars align

[Verse 1]
Back in the hood just looking out the window
Staring at the moon somehow make all my problems little
I don't know why life is hard I guess it's all a riddle
To keep it real I haven't solved it but it's all official
I grow a little from day-to-day wish to stay the same
But you ain't really out here growing unless you making change
You selling out you out here hoein' I just play my lane
And bitches out here smoking Jane and it's a blazing chain

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 2]
Ain't no love for the other side
And fuck them other niggas cause you know I'm down for mine
I know I lose a couple of them slacking down the line
The Inglewood is crazy hope I make it out in time
Just trust your dreams I never doubted mine
I run and pace, you run in  place, your shit is basic
I hunt for the front of the line we all be switching places
I'm running hot like a box you opted from ventilation
Straight to the top cause you ain't stopping all this insulation
Account me gaining hoping all the time they fed me hatred
Now I'm back to fuck the world feel the penetration
I'm so sorry for the wait I also grew impatient
I'm loving life, we blooming in with new relations
I'm here facing all this marijuan (marijuan)
Oh yeah I'm gonna keep on shining light a mine
Replacing all the lows smoking higher times
Flying out my mind penning all this time in rhymes

[Hook] x 2

Yeah, yeah, What you see is what you get right
This exactly how it look right
This exactly what it look like
What you see is what you get right
I'm blowing on this shit right
I'm knowing that this it right
