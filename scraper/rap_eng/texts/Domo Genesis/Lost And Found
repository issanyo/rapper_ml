[Intro]
Some of those you can take off though
I don't like all of that shit yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna find my way (that's hard)
I'm just tryna find my way (that's fire)

[Verse]
Bout to light up for (?) and (?)
We transcendin' into different days
They say he say she say, life is sweeter than lemonade
Reach for the light cause undoubtedly we seen dimmer days
Hundred percent the world full of minute maids
I lost and found inside the disarray and aye
Can you see it? Can you feel it?
Lost innocence the smell of teen spirit
Sometimes I can't breath even the lyrics
And sometimes just sometimes I seem fearless
Naw I'm just livin' like you
I'm in my feelin's like you
Feelin' like a victim like you
Sometimes I pop a pain killer, maybe like two
And I, uh, yeah
Rest in peace to my aunt, it's her funeral today
But I'm too busy tryna finish up this album
And I don't know if my feelin's turned numb or anything
But ain't no tears comin' out 'em
Like how come?
I guess life'll triple all the baggage you can handle
We ain't landin' this yet
Stayin' focused with the cannabis lit
I handle my shit
Runnin' so high recently I'm makin' the devil resent
Hope my friends ain't on no scandal and shit
I hope my lady ain't plot to put her hand on my chips
I'm standin' to get my dreams granted hand over fist like
How can I resist?
And if I ain't chasin' on dreams how can I exist?
How can I exist?
And if I ain't chasin' on dreams how can I exist?
Nigga just listen, aye

[Outro]
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
