Money money money money money money uh
Money money rule the world, yeah
I guess I'm gettin' lost in the swing of things
Maybe I'm just caught up in the twirl
I mean all a nigga ever ever had to his name was a dollar and a dream
I'm rollin' all this weed young try'na figure what it means

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm cookin' up the plan
Yeah it's right on the stove
Tryna cop a ticket, take my, take my life on the road
Steady rocking writing all the sights help me light in a low
Praying for flight, while tryna balance my highs and my lows
Sacrifice for the life that I chose
And when they envy light and push all they might to impose
I know it's tough but I just hope I stay tight with my bros
And even if I don't then I hope it was rightfully so
And never in spite of this dough
That's what inspire me though
I come alive when the road toughens
No cheat code but watch me beat it like it stole something
I can't be silent on my momma I'mma roll something
Over I ain't got a second to chill, I'mma road run it
Driving down the same old scenes niggas got left at
But I ain't pulling that same routine my g you can bet that
I'm tapped in a way but stay bracing for the set backs
I'm sticking in this game til I find me a place to rest at
The evil in my face I stay patience hit with a set back
Give me room, my ambition you can't suppress that
I feel this in my veins, they hoping this adrenaline drains
I'm unscathed, brush the dirt they tried to kick on my name
They only noticing it now but boy I been in my lane
From cracked in to panoramic yeah my vision has changed
Back when life was rap, riches, bad bitches and chains
Fast tracking minutes nowadays a different exchange
Flat broke used to have some sick shit on my brain
Like how I'm feeling all this hurt and still ain't getting no game?
But I just worked through my feelings
Never deserted my realness
Reimburse me for real like I deserve at least a million

[Refrain]
It's funny how they love you till its all go down right
The evil of the money make the world go round like
And even though it's ugly I get lost in a twirl
Cause money money money money rule the world
I said, how they love you till it all go down
Yeah the evil of the money make the world go round
And even though I know it's ugly I get lost in the twirl
Cause money money money money rule the world

[Chrous]
Any money money money money money money rule the world
Uh, I guess I'm getting lost in the swing of things
Maybe I'm just caught up in the twirl
Ay, all a nigga ever ever had was a dollar and a dream
Rolling up this weed

[Outro]
Know I've heard it said there's humor in misfortune
You know I wonder if they laugh when I am dead
Why am I fighting to live?
If I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see?
When there ain't nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give?
When no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live?
If I'm just living to die
