[Intro]
Yeah, bitch. I ain't spit bars in a minute, I'm kinda rusty. I got my yorkie in here with me, you feel me. I paid $1500 for it. Not a cheap dog, not cheap at all. Yeah, bitch

[Verse 1]
When the fuck did we get this high, I can't remember
Cold, middle of the summer feeling like the winter
Shorty wanna roll these trees for the kid cause I'm a winner
Watchin' for the enemies but we don't speak it over dinner, that's the key to living
Niggas wanna talk some beef, but be too weak to mention
They lie around me and cutting corners with cheap decisions
I'm just a mortal man and I ain't tryna be pretentious
But young nigga got the glow like Chief Keef is with him
Float like the ocean, gold fish sleepin' with him, don't wanna be the victim
Ain't got no hatred in my heart but jealous niggas I despise I'm under pressuring
You could see aggression in these eyes, the world deceptive in it lies
Depression I'm just pressing through the slime
[?] I'm pressing their lines, I'm fine
Too raw for these niggas on their swaggy shit
Like KG told Charlie, cancerous

[Hook]
I'm just countin' my cash
My momma sayin' that I'm living too fast
And yeah I'm doing all the shit but no I don't wanna crash
I'm just a good guy but I'm doin' it bad

[Verse 2]
I used to roll the Corolla before I blowed up
Throw my [?] Nova Scotia, boulders
Cold as my ex-hoes exposed to my shoulder
I was on the road when you were stuffing dope in joint rollers
Too young to leave you sober
And I ain't tryna talk unless money or Motorola, save the chatter nigga
Running 'cross burning bridges, scaling these broken ladders nigga
Gossip all you want, your opinions ain't never mattered nigga
Faded pen and records out of my nana's house
Cause I was either pen and pad or black and pulling hammers out
Another dumb nigga not about to understand my route
I know my worth, I'm never standing out
Fuck what you handing out
What you talking ain't impressive to me
I lost my uncle wrong timing, learned some lessons through it
This shit is soulful, can't price check a progressive movement
From precious ruins and heavy pressure we pressin' through it
Won't be depressed if I lose my breath in this revolution
Evrey step I'm giving my best with my chest protruding
But like Aaliyah said, we need a resolution
And I think being honest is the best solution

[Hook]
I'm just countin' my cash
My momma sayin' that I'm living too fast
And yeah I'm doing all the shit but no I don't wanna crash
I'm just a good guy but I'm doin' it bad

[Outro]
You ain't even know my time was coming
I said you ain't even know my time was coming
You ain't even know my time was coming, yeah
You ain't even know my time was coming, yeah
