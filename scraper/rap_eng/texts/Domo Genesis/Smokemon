I wanna smoke the very best
Like no one ever does
To roll it is my real test
To smoke 'em is my cause
I will travel across the land
Smoking all the strains
Tried to get all the THC
All up in my brain

Smokemon! Gotta smoke 'em
It's you and weed, you know it's my destiny
Smokemon! Oh, you're my best friend
In a world that's full with feds
Smokemon! Gotta smoke 'em, our hearts so true
Smoking and you'll roll too
You smoke me out, and I'll smoke you
Smokemon gotta smoke 'em all, gotta smoke 'em all
