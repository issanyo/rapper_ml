[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Life moving fast I'm hopin' this burn slow
This life movin' fast I'm hopin' this burn slow
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Keep your friends 'cause they'll turn on ya
Quick to let that ether slow burn on ya
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burner
Hit it fast or
It's not a quick fix its a slow burn
And it burn slower and slower and slower
As the world turn over and over and over

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Gettin' high the only way I know to feel closer to sober
Clear headed but the past lookin' over my shoulder
Slow burn on my heart, beatin' heavy
You can feel these bass rhythms in my sternum
You can see the drive less I'm blackin' out and swervin'
Sparkin' magic in the city would've thought my name was Earvin
Urban legend in that (skrrt)
Playin' low and drive slow
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed
While you playin' with yo' time that's gon' take a big toe
You can't take it with you nigga no matter how your grip hold
Seat back, sit low it's the ride that I know
Tryna take whatever's mine I feel obliged when I smoke
The street I'm on could teach a lesson to a slow learner
Need my couple seconds to breath hope it's a slow burner
Burn slow, burn slow uh

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Keep your friends 'cause they'll turn on ya
Quick to let that ether slow burn on ya
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burn, slow burn
Slow burn, slow burn, slow burner
Hit it fast or
It's not a quick fix its a slow burn

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Slow money get that all I know money
Why you acting scared money that don't make no money
Pouring out more than I make what more can they take from me
Slow burnin' to the face please get all that fake from me
Ya'll still in the same place duckin' and dodgin'
Quarterback to play until the day I run outta options
I chose my own faith from the day I broke outta college
I'm runnin' outta friends but I'm runnin' right up on knowledge
A coward dies a hunnid but this real is everlastin'
Only time is of the essence, as we speedin' through this path
Got these numbers on my mind, don't need my fingers for this math
Know that good in life is forever but as long as it lasts hope its a slow burner
