[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
Mellowhigh!

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats ]
Mellowhigh, we from the hood
We be there some time it be on our mind
Visit our moms and homies
Back on the block and try
To get them out that mindset
Speaking of a fucking mindset
Mine's this middle finger, yup
We don't give no fucks
Bitch I live this shit
You sipping out a dreamers cup
Fluorescent adolescent
Comes repeated in a sequence, like the Jetsons
Flying in a couple of seconds
From the medicated marijuana
No more stress, and my best friend
Is assisted, while the spliff get lifted
(Mellowhigh, mellowhigh)
Reefer thoughts, so listen, Iâ€™m getting my own nigga; the fuck is you on nigga

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Doms niggah, 100 percent Mellowhigh
Faded, nigga fuck everybody else

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Mellowhigh bitch, you know what it is
Domo Genesis, kid in my zone in this bitch
Fuck with this we gettin in, ten strong in this bitch
Weed got me feeling like King Kong in this bitch
I'm a king to a pawn, I take monster steps
Run this shit I feel it in my quadriceps
Point up like a nigga got a lot to get
So high I ain't got a lot conscious left
With a pistol and a pad I'm on
They can't hold me, game on the line
Go gold, I'm so Kobe
For so long the game is mine, what you owe me
But I ain't no slave when my name ain't Toby
Homie the wolves in this spot so hungry
The pack with me feeling like the top so lonely, big heart
But the block just froze me
No love for a bitch, don't commit get cold feet
