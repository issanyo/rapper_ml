[Intro: Anderson .Paak & Domo Genesis]
It just needs that... uh, that uh....
Yeah
Yeah! Okay (ooooh)
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now)
(Hold out!)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop 'till you)
Hold (feel it) that light (baby you got to, hold on)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Baby we can dance if you like
Shake that pretty ass on the flash of the light
Off of one glance, can only imagine the hype
Trying to figure routes to being in your plans for the night
'Cause I haven't felt this good in weeks
Got a fresh cut now I'm looking for the freaks
Fresh car wash, so don't put your hand on the Jeep
Use your etiquette, and bring your own sand to the beach bit
All around the world they keep running
Shawty wanna hold my hand, it ain't nothing
Mariah said if itâ€™s worth time, then say something
And they tell me I'm out of my mind, I ain't budging
Sorry if I'm so overzealous
'Cause I haven't felt no energy like you on this planet
So yeah, put your number in my handheld
And fill that bitches with fan mail, ya dig

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now)
(Hold out!)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop 'till you)
Hold (you feel it) that light (baby you got to
Hold on)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Really good, nice to meet ya
Maybe we could smoke a little Indonesia
Shake up the world like a geo seizure
Your love song so strong you don't need no features no
Little Jimmy, let's park at last
This cupid never hit me in my heart that fast
I watch it burn whoever start that gas to walk a little
You're either gonna park or crash
It's muscle memory
Walking down a similar path, I feel the energy
Or maybe it's the way I'm feeling from all this Hennessy
I'm way, way bigger than what they tend to be
And you could be my Marilyn Monroe
I'm John Kennedy, you know it
You feel it
'Cause I haven't felt this rhythm in a minute
Gettin' faded until we fall
Got arches, so I hit it
Whether spring, summer or fall
If I want it I'mma get it

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now)
(Hold out!)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop until)
Hold (you feel it) that light (baby you got to, hold on)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
Now I could turn a pussy to a kiddie pool
And I could swim around until my fingers prune
But if you stick around I'll probably sing a tune
If you stick around I'll probably roll another up right now
Can a nigga groove? (uhh yeah)
Come on!

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (oooooh)
Smoke that fire  (ooooh)

[Instrumental]
