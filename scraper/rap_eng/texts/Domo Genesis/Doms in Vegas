[Verse 1]
Yeah, let the smoke simmer live
From a spot only disclosed for winners
My heart is cold as winter
I draw this image with the artiste of the soulful sinner
But only God can judge my partners and my co-defendants
Single parent home, half my life my pops incarcerated
I know that life can be a bitch there ain't no harsher statement
But all the long time made the God as hard as pavements
Stand or fall I'm ready for the brawl involving large arrangements
Man I planned this shit in my youth
It's concentrated energy in all the shit that I do
That's all I have I take my past and end up spitting the truthBut they be hating when I shine cause they visions is booth
Niggas playin', don't take in any shit that they sayin'
It's entertainment, just put 'em in the steps that I taken
I bet they vanquish, hard knock life don't get the best of him
Hard knock life don't let the devil in
Thought you could see me? Quit the mescaline
I'm balling till the blessings end
Regardless who the hardest I'm stepping in, next to win

[Hook]
Said I'm knocking hard, don't let the devil in
But regardless bitch I'm stepping in
It's the hard knock life won't get the best of him
I'm balling till the blessings end

[Outro]
Boy just be yourself, if people don't like you if you're being yourself FUCK 'EM!
Let me tell you something, I used to go out with a girl 'bout your age, I tried to please her pappy all the time went out my way to please her pappy I come here one day I said: "nice weather we're having" say "you can't say that, you can't say that it might rain". I said: "nice tie you got on" say "you can't say that, why you tryna choke me with it". Point I'm tryna tell you son, is be yourself, people don't like you when you're being yourself fuck 'em! Fuck 'em up against the wall! With handcuffs on and crazy glue on their lips. That's all you do
*Hmm, words to live by.*
