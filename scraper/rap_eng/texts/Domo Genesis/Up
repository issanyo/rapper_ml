[Verse 1: Tyler]
The Supreme tee is kinda dingy
Pass the fucking puffer, nigga stingy with the Usher, let it burn
Skate session with my niggas
On a cloud, where's my inhaler, I can't even breath
I don't smoke weed
But I'm on a cloud high enough to give me a nose bleed
Say farewell to the brain cells, neutrons can smell us
My niggas keep enough green to get a bush jealous
Roll tighty, the joint righty, go buy a label
And busters don't get the zimper in Chris Lighty, alrighty
Or maybe a swisher, I begin to kiss her
Keepin' all the arms and limbs in a large bin
My niggas keep mary jane like a fucking Tarzan
In the fuckin toilet where my bars been
They been the shit since Riley figured out she really likes Dark men
Domo hitting bowls, nuggets size of coals
Rolling a whole 'nother blunt the size of a troll
Davon on paroll, so if the highway patrol
Sees us strolling to 7-11 to get a Arizona
And some donuts, he'll be in a hole, but we're not gonna let it happen
Im not talking music when I say were the best at wrapping
The kush, coke, Ritalin, and mushroom caps in my system, um

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
I break number 2 pencils cause I write so strong
Tyler rolling up a stick so when it lights, so long
Brass monkey, clarinet, ten drop in the gong
Gas mask, vaporizer, tranquilize you with the bong
Imagine gas and 'laxing, puff passing past tense
Future kush, cool tour, poke your arms blue or
Dream, smoke white like vanilla bean ice cream
Besides OF, Mary Jane and me make a nice team
Pause, aw you getting too fat, bitch
Munchies, gaining weight is fucking automatic
Can't fit into the plus size of that sack's fifth
She get high, get down on hot dogs and pick up the cat bitch
The powder is packed in the straw, Sammy claim he like chowder
Nostrils are allowed to scream white power
Overdose in a quince then detox, she rocks
Got em sweating like they inhaling on she cops
And we the drug, and we the drug, and we the drug
Bitch I'm high as fuck, just let it sing to you

[Verse 3: Domo]
I stay in the sky so there's no way you can get fly as me
Niggas wish that some point in their life they'll get high as me
Never though, got a dorm room filled with hella smoke
With towels under the door hoping no one outside smell the dro
Fuck it, I'm blazing up, bad bitch craving dust
So I passed it to her last thing sheâ€™ll see before waking up
Strong dank leave your main bitches with throat aches
One of em half bakeing, half dressed cause her clothes stank
Rolling paper skills, it's the time I showcase
So rush down, bitches want a star beat like old Bapes
Where Davon at? cause he can Zieir too
Big Cam Lawrence kid, you can even call Lionel
Tyler dog, hit it once for the game
Give it to Hodgy Beats then dish it off to the Brain
My eyes heavy, someone give me a orange juice
Louie V shades so my thoughts don't support you
Thoughts decreases, hunger builds in my torso
Paper plane on paper plane, can I please aboard you
You, you, uh, ayo Vyron, light that one

[Bridge]
Kush, coke, X, mushroom
I'm high as fuck

[Verse 4: Tyler]
I'm Atheist, so I let the blunt bless her
Higher then a fat nigga bitch blood pressure
On the dresser is the kush compressor
That four cents of bags of fluorescent flower pedals
Take a hit of this shit, inviting some
Bitches over to the crib, take a sniff, feeling numb
Baby girl, this is love, mixed with coke
And the eighty proof is in the pudding, so is a pint of cum
This is fun, don't you even try to run
Get you high, get you drunk, oh wait, you're not even real
This is fucking fake, snow white is in my nasal
I don't even think I'm able to shimmy passed the table
Without tripping on cables, me and Travis crying
Earl is probably dying, Cedric licking walls
And all of us tripping balls, heart beating in a trance
I'm in a submissive stance, I'm not fucking playing
When I say call the ambulance, shit

[Outro]
Call the fucking ambulance
I can't feel me, call the.. I can't fucking breathe
I'm not fucking.. this isn't.. What the fuck is this he..
Yo call the ambulance, my heart is beating too fast
I'm bout to.. Open a fucking window
