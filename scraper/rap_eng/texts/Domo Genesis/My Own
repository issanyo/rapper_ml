[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I wake up every morning, bless the herb and
Say a prayer to thank the Lord for my purpose
Today could be my day but that ain't making me nervous
I'm saying, worrying worthless
I'm worth waking up the Devil, pay with proof of his purchase
Even when days was darker and it was harder to breathe
I embraced it, flourished, though it's hard to believe
Stayed on the bench to see the starters recede
And now I'm calling shots, star in this league, like Moses parting the seas
Learned how to swim when I was drowning, no help, y'know
When they doubted, I was 'bout it myself, you know
Gotta swing short handed, yeah, lucky us
Born in debt, yet I won't let them commas fuck me up
Life ain't your bitch, she just a buddy fuck
A quick pump, now I'm trying chase that bitch with a muddy cup
Funny how time flies when you coming up
And I'm just me hoping I done enough

[Chorus: JMSN]
Had to do everything on my own
Can't expect you to understand
Everything, everything that I know
But I'm doing the best I can

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I'm out, no doubt, for the power and money
And I might crack a smile, but it ain't shit funny
And you niggas can't take shit from me
When it's fire, I be icy
And hot when it ain't shit sunny
I feel amazing, feeling rewarded 'cause of my anguish
Just waiting for the day I can fade away in the vanquish
For now I got my dues and I'm scraping cakes for the payment
Who knew one display of mistakes was making me famous, huh?
My confidence powers itself
Shit I been getting dollars if knowledge is wealth
The way to figure out the world is with knowledge itself
And with that knowledge I just went out and got it myself
So I ...
I ...
I ...

[Chorus: JMSN]
Had to do everything on my own
Can't expect you to understand
Everything, everything that I know
But I'm doing the best I can
