[Intro]
It feel like a crime
Ayy, young niggas stay way misunderstand
No, I can't change my way, feel good, bruh
Niggas don’t make it from my hood
That's why I'm gettin’ high
And no, I can't let a day go by
Know a nigga on it rain or shine
I heard you niggas stay online
Ayy, uh, listen, listen, listen, yeah, yeah, uh, uh
Listen, uh, ayy, listen, listen

[Chorus]
It feel like a crime
Young niggas stay way misunderstood
No, I can't change my way, feel good, bruh
Niggas don't make it from my hood
That's why I'm gettin' high
No, I can't let a day go by
Know a nigga on it rain or shine
I heard you niggas stay online
’Cause I’m comin' alive

[Verse 1]
Riding through the city on some dirty shit
Reserve perfectly, swift as a surgeon
No murder I’m flirting with, I'm nerveless
I got a different purpose
You just itching the surface
You just a gimmick purchase
Bitch, I'm still that nig in person
I'm double working over friends
’Cause most these niggas serpents
Who really with me in this skirmish? Man, this shit a circus
I'm really tryna flourish but I'm in this burning furnace
And I heard it never wait for turns and I'm just being earnest
You niggas don't deserve this
I'll take everything you believe and leave that shit deserted
You just falling in with the stream, I'm in a different current
Check how I swerve in this mix, it's still existent
I know how urgent it gets, cut all that silly shit
Came in the building to break these millies with my affiliates
We on the high line, you picturing from the sidelines
Crossing these pylons
I'm 'bout the commas, fuck the dot com, nigga

[Chorus]
It feel like a crime
Young niggas stay way misunderstood
No, I can't change my way, feel good, bruh
Niggas don't make it from my hood
That's why I'm gettin' high
No, I can't let a day go by
Know a nigga on it rain or shine
I heard you niggas stay online
'Cause I'm comin' alive

[Verse 2]
I been catching real vibes, what do you believe?
I been up here workin', I been smokin' weed
Half a dozen tricks that I got up my sleeve
I don't see too many ways that I can't succeed
Gettin' high enough to bring a cloud down
I done had this pope vision for a while now
I inspire, so many niggas should bow down
I freestyle and every event to me is wild style
I can turn my burdens to a love song
In the mist of the trouble, feel like it's nothing wrong
I can see right through it when it's done wrong
And I can end it all like Thanos with the glove on
I believe in karma, what do you believe?
I believe my timing now is true indeed
I feel like I lived this, this ain't new for me
And I be coming for everything that was due for me, for real

[Bridge]
Aw yeah, that's perfect
Way misunderstood
Niggas don't make it from my hood
Ayy, uh, uh

[Chorus]
Said, it feel like a crime
Young niggas stay way misunderstood
No, I can't change my way, feel good, bruh
Niggas don't make it from my hood
That's why I'm gettin' high
No, I can't let a day go by
Know a nigga on it rain or shine
I heard you niggas stay online
'Cause I'm comin' alive

[Outro]
Bitch, I'm comin' alive
Stay yo' bitch ass online, ayy
Stay yo' ass online
'Cause y'all ain't built for this shit, for real though
Stay yo' ass online
'Cause you don't really want it in real life
You don't know what it feel like
Yeah, shit feel right
Don't come outside
You better stay yo' ass online
Don't come outside, na-na-na-na
'Cause I'm comin' for mine, I'm comin' alive
Niggas stay online
