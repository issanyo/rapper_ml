[Chorus]
Image of mine are you just a myth
Waiting for the stars and I need to exist
Swinging you life until the final bar
Seeing all the seas for you to avoid who you are

[Verse 1]
Ambition like a drug
No I can’t quit, you want to walk in my shoes
But they can’t fit I have been aiming for success like
I can’t miss I will explain how to get rich and
Stay the same bitch
Golf Wang our position will be vanquished
Busy on the boards I will be on my Lil Wayne shit
Every world tour I shoot off a different language
I am sticking to the script you been looking for
A lame smith took it to be patient my house
Bomb grey shit two stone grape ships
Rap game facelift ya’ll niggas basic
I’m real nigga face it
You be on the same shit I will be more
John Blaze shit
You put me on it and I closed case on it
Because I told ya’ll all that shit you come with
You face it told you I would end up in the
Dream I was chasing
All you really need is the patience

[Chorus]
Image of mine are you just a myth
Waiting for the stars and I need to exist
Swinging you life until the final bar
Seeing all the seas for you to avoid who you are
