[Verse 1]
Damn, I never pictured this
I'm so high, this shit's ridiculous
Where did I put my shit?
Wait, wait, okay, here it is
As I light this place up
Just me alone, so the joints get faced up
Floating through the stars, my whole nights all spaced up
And my thoughts tryna build my place up
Phones buzzing, so I reach and try and read it
But my visions kinda blurry, so I really can't see it
Something important, it might be it
Or maybe a bitch that don't need shit
Close my eyes and the shit that I'm seeing
Is the reason that I be in the moods that I be in
Damn, I'm really baked, I can't tell if I'm asleep or I'm awake
I'll just sit and wait, yeah, I'll just sit and wait

[Interlude: Tyler]
Domo, nigga, open the fucking door, nigga
Shit, we got shit to do come the fuck on, it's cold nigga

[Verse 2]
Let me try to sober up
Throw some water on my face, only if it's cold enough
Confidently wiping my face with my shirt
Looking in the mirror like that ain't work, damn

[Interlude: Tyler]
Domo, open the fucking door, what the fuck are you doing?
It's not funny no more, I'm cold as fuck nigga
I ain't got no inhaler nigga, shit, open up

[Verse 3]
Okay, I'm coming
Walking to the door and I seem to notice something
The floor is just a cloud of smoke and I'm running
Reaching at the end of the cloud and I'm jumping
Flowing through the air just about to hear something
Feel a lil shake and my body start buzzing like

[Outro: Tyler]
Nigga, you good? (Yeah, I'm cool, dog)
Talking in your sleep and shit nigga, you tripping (Shit, my bad)
