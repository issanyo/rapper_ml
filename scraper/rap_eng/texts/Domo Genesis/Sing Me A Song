[Intro]
1,2
I hope I got a 16 for this
I hope I got a-, aye
Shut the fuck up, aye

[Verse 1]
Man, you niggas ain't get no peace until my niggas get they pieces up
For these reasons they tell me to keep dreaming
When honestly I don't even get the sleep enough
I keep my worries in the streets too much, I guess
I walk heavy hope the devil can handle these steps
Feelin' so blessed, I leave hell with a settlement check
Walking through fire with a shark face sweater on deck
Money can't pay for what you owe, you forever in debt nigga
No money can't pay for a day of respect nigga
And money can't change the view between you and the next nigga
If we viewin' in the grand scheme of things
Nigga we can't dream, we makin' shit moves like a dance team
Pardon 'cause I ain't with the band scene
This is one man song about that road that the man be in

[Interlude]
Yeah, this is one man song about the-

[Chorus]
Imma just sing me a song about sittin' all alone
And day dreamin' 'bout a million (a milli, a milli, a milli)
But dreaming ain't gon' take it alone 'cause if it's taking too long that's when it break a nigga's feelin's up, and
I ain't got to answer to shit but got these voices in my head that always sound so appealing, like
I can't promise you gon' make it to the morning, till the morning comes so we gon' have to try to make it real tonight
Whatchu feelin' like

[Verse 2]
What's niggas problems if they runnin' out of options
Minds only on the dollars
And they fumbling with they conscience
In a place of no control and hate feeling like they boxed in
Trouble what's ahead nigga be locked up or get locked in
Really what's the purpose?
Just trying not to be worthless
Do I deserve this?
I admit I used to be nervous
Moving with the current might get swallowed in this deep water
Thru the ups and downs and back again, I'm like a seesaw-er
Trying to cut the snakes and softer niggas trying to leech off us
Pat you on the back, the same niggas try to leap-frog it
That secret is a rap, won't catch another night of sleep off us
Quit thinking that a simple spark of weed could be a peace offering
I mean respect's a hard thing to acquire
And losing it is easy as walking with your feet on the wire
That's why I'm staying higher up just to keep me inspired
Let that one man sing, who trying to preach to the choir, uh

[Chorus]
Imma just sing me a song about sittin' all alone and daydreaming 'bout a million (a milli)
But dreaming ain't gonna take it alone 'cause if it's taking too long that's when it break a nigga's feelin's up, and
I ain't gotta answer to shit but got these voices in my head that always sound so appealing like
I can't promise you gon' make it to the morning, till the morning comes so we gon' have to try to make it real tonight
Whatchu feelin' like
