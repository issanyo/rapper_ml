[Domo Genesis]
I'm still cruising, despite rumors of lane switching
I stay true to this music, when niggas ain't listing
While you losin', I'm movin', trust me I ain't tripping
Tryna run southern California like Lane Kiffin
I'm on mine, the same nigga with the same vision
A big rich and you stacking, we share the same difference
While niggas trippin', tryna kick it with the same bitches
I'm on a mission, my next steps I can't mention
To my divison the end, is what I'm loyal to
And a couple bro's outside, you know I'm supporting you
I ain't got to drop no names, know its the chosen few
To keep it real, that water fake shit is long overdue
I work hard so they can feel me flex
And the only question left is do they feel me yet?
And I ain't even here with nothing, but they share regrets
And when I'm making high moves they ain't feel these steps
Uh...and I be on some shit you can't understand now
Like how I play victim to the voice in my head now
So much pressure on my soul, I could lay it down
But I think on what this shit is missing so I stay around
And I ain't felt this confused in a minute
How they write us off? we better than half these niggas spittin'
I guess you ain't getting it unless you got a little gimmick
They don't want to see the story 'less you wrap and paint the premise
My life ain't sweet shit, my momma raised a warrior
Single parent, one autistic, guess I'm the courier
That's why I study raps in the tracks, John warm it up
Cause real cold hearts get you the prison or the coroner
This shit real... it's realer than it's ever been...
All this extra thinking got me floating on the medicine
Stunting all these niggas I be feeling like a veteran
Was in the tunnel, now I see the lights like Edison
Better win, I kick it with the peace I'm resting in
Cause waiting for these niggas to notice making me petulant
But they ain't ready for this shit they taken pre-requisites
Cause everything I'm putting in the streets is real definite
Definitely the nigga that don't wanna be reckoned with
I don't find so much in the piece, I be heaven sent
Man, do it for the nigga with long dreams
Show him how a real young nigga get long C.R.E.A.M
Keep your heart in your hustle and don't run with the wrong team
Nigga be yourself, and don't end up on the wrong seam
Sorry if I kick a little shit, but the flow mean
Still dropping real chill tracks for the dope fiends
By dope I mean weed, motherfucker, we grow green
And I be in the center of the bull like Joe King
I still leave 'em, broke dreams and regrets
Already feel at home and I'm just getting my feet wet
I work hard so they can feel me flex
And the only question left is do they feel me yet?
