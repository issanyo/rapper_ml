[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Wake up in the morning check the mirror like I got it
Money, Power, Respect, Nigga what you know about it
Surrounding myself with niggas who only concern is profits
So if you ain't talkin' money then you speakin' off topic, Nigga stop it!
I been hot since Jordan was in gym socks
I'm Kobe with the fro or Ron Artest when he pissed off
I get off a travesty these niggas mad at me
Game in a sleeper and I ain't even had a damn release
My plan to be everything that you niggas demand to see
Smoking tree until I kick the can and leave, Damnit B
I got my mind right, these niggas scared of me
Chilling cause I know whats up ahead of me, Destiny

[Hook]
Sunlight could never shine
Like this love of yours and mine
The stars and the moon above
Could never outshine our love...
Shine... shine...shine,shine,shine
Baby, this love of yours



And mine is gonna shine

Shine shine

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
One for the money and two for the G's
But not really cause there ain't another nigga like me
I stunt, So I'm knowin' niggas don't like me
They know that livin' like me is so un-like-ly
I rock an ambush chain and a fuckin' white tee
And the adidas I got from that commercial with Mike G
It's lookin' real good, Ashley Sky
I'm bout to flex tweet, don't ask me why
Cool niggas ain't extinct, we the last alive
Winners circle small ya'll niggas maximize
The effortless approach of a mastermind
Cause you know it ain't swag if you had to try

[Hook]
Sunlight could never shine
Like this love of yours and mine
The stars and the moon above
Could never outshine our love...
Shine... shine...shine,shine,shine
Baby, this love of yours and mine is gonna shine shine shine
