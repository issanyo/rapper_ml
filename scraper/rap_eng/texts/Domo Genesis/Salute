[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I don't think that I ever changed, ball hard or spark spliffs
And when I'm in the booth, it's super like Clark Kent
Competition fails to ever place an event
So when I step up to the track, you consider my shit a win
Never gonna stop, Genesis is the begin
All about the money, I'm changin' my name to Yen
Swagger so tall, check Yao up in the chin
Stay reachin' for the sky like a nigga can't swim
But I'm on my two and my pivot lookin great
Tell Z to have 'em rolled when I touch down in the state
Tell them we eatin' well and we never scrapin' plates
Stealin' bitches from they niggas just becuase I like the chase
Odd Future wolves, full moon, salivate
Look I done made it, the same nigga that you hate
Salutin' the game, pilots all up in the place
Fly niggas do it all, y'all grounded like bad grades
Never said thug, but my niggas will pop
And if it's Louie V or Gucci then my niggas will cop
Wait for the summer, Rolling Papers will drop
And hatin' and speculatin' is the shit that will stop
I'mma go hard, or I'mma do nothin'
Like a beeper in a toilet, bet my shit buzzin'
Hell yeah I'm the shit, just take a whiff, cousin
Now you all frowned up, thought I told you I been stuntin'
I get my highs and lows like NASDAQ
Spit up addiction and bag that, pass crack
Livin' the life, you lames remain wack
If I ain't gettin' laid, I'm gettin' high and watchin' Flapjack and that's that
