[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Until the day I die
Thrive, tryin’ to play the odds
Got sick and tired of waitin’
Had to chase it for my state of mind
I had a great device
Pray when that day arrives
And I’m a survivor
Smoke a gang of kush to stabilize it
Don’t even play with God, just play your role
Stayin’ drive
Success a long road
If you want it, gotta pay the toll
They couldn’t see it
I was gaining focus
You niggas carbon copy
Your character plain and solace
Hey, what’s the motive man?
Just stay devoted
Do what you're growin’
Let them niggas (?)
You see the moment
Beamin' easy in these streets that I creep on
You see me glowin’ or shinin’ like a good afternoon
Three in the mornin’, I be zonin’
Bring decease to opponents
Cause they don’t want it
Single roll it
If they came at me foulin’
We’re in the (?)
And if real niggas went out of style
We didn’t notice
Outchea here livin’ like the police (?)

[Verse 2: LE$]
Look, uh
The smoke stuck in the air
No lie, they ain’t playin’ it fair
Tell the truth, never care
Go hard, gotta hustle like I’m drownin’
Straight face while these niggas been clownin’
A long way from home, been zonin’
Think I missed a couple of mornings
Cause I ain’t been asleep
All these niggas still snorin’
Thought I saw a palm tree on fire that didn’t burn
On this long ass road, made a couple of wrong turns
Bounced back though
Still catchin’ stunts on my last hoe
Remember when you're prayin’
He might give you what you ask for
Can’t be passive
Gotta say what you mean
And chase dreams like a mothafuckin’ fiend
Like a Glock with a beam, can’t miss
Red dot on the top, one shot
Bet I come and get my spot
That’s a long ass drop
Hope you’re ready for your fall
Think a million is enough?
Niggas thinkin’ too small, uh

[Chorus]
