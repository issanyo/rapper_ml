[Sample]
You know that you could be walking down the street and find a treasure
And suddenly the world you see, you feel comes the pleasure
Inside of me you feel that life’s for real
And you always want to spend your love about
Could you be down so long
Just sharing's what is all about

[Verse 1]
Uh, smoke rising from the vehicle, it’s been a long ride
They want me off, but I’m still high
Still pushing that hooptie on the 105
Cross the bridge still rising, see that skyline
Got me feeling alive
Niggas said that I would perish, I didn't budge
Couldn’t stop me, bitch, I’ve been known for the missing love
Trippin', tough, like I was ten seconds from giving up
Hit them up
We can see you kicking dust into these niggas, mention us
Lived to prove against the odds
It’s really nothing, I feel ‘em coming
I’m christening for young gun and devil on my back
Feel like I’m sitting in the oven hot
Living how I want, got me some money
Can you judge me? Naw
Still they do, it’s just something that I don’t listen to
Still I grew, thriving on, I feel like I was slipping through
Sticking truth, tended to the mission, cause a nigga knew
I’m about to fly if they let me out this pigeon coop

[Verse 2]
As I’m blazing this weed
As my mind start racing and my eye sights bleed
As the quickie world turns and I define my G
I don’t sleep, too busy, trying to find my peace
One time for my niggas with a vision of the pictures
Stay determined in your work, well versed in your scripture
We’re together when it hurts, never let them see you injured
Make the reflection in your mirror, offer something to remember
Do it single-handedly even when they say you can’t
You never needed company, all you needed was a chance
All you need is to believe, you can see is this shit advance
Ain’t scared of you nigga, but fear a nigga with a plan, uh

Oooooh, God...
