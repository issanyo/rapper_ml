[Intro]

[Verse]
Uh, one shot, one ques
How you bitch niggas feel?
More soul than a lil' bit
Visions of it all, ain't no comfort in this lil' shit
You got it and I need it, consider this, I'm about to hit a lick
Switch, show these baby gill niggas who they dealing with
It's I, you geeks are just speaking of still images
You fear me in my physical form
I'm killin' anything you niggas picture me on
It's been a minute, penny-pinching, we eventually spawn
I was to get up, fill up
Machine gun raps for all my niggas rollin' with us
And whoever wanna oppose, consider them niggas hit up
For all the days with no pay, we still lit up
For the money, yeah I get a gut feeling like a sit up
Go and give up, you niggas pathetic
I had to scrimmage for the trenches
Never been so pathetic, this some shit, I regret it
But slow me down, never leaded
I'm still spitting this fire like I've been sipping unleaded
He too sick for the medics, I cut him deep like a open heart
More beast than the passengers in Noah ark
See me in the streets, be discrete or get broke apart
Man, it's a thin line, rest in peace to Owen Hart
Damn, don't need you tellin' me who I am
All that tellin', tellin', man I'm tallying up the grams
Smoking killer Cali, man, that package that's in demand
Spoke with Dom's on the work he makin' it crack with spoon
It's dope nigga, it's too dope nigga, there's no hope nigga
