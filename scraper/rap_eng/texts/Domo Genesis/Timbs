[Intro - Hodgy Beats]
Golf Wang
MellowHigh, Dom Genesis
You already know who I'm is, bitch
Hey, show these niggas what's up, son

[Verse 1 - Domo Genesis]
Bring it on, I'm young and I'm back at it
Exposing these whack cats as fast as a crack addict
This nigga's a savage with nastiest bad habits
Class act, we don't even chat with these rap faggots
Sleepin' in a trap and drink 'til I'm mad ratchet
Breathin' in hashish 'til I feel asthmatic
Money, music, and fashion, tryin' to pull a hat-trick
Game lookin' dry and I apply like chapstick
Suck a fat dick, haters, abolish
I hate to be honest, I even leave my haters astonished
And like a wallet, easy when I reach in my pocket
Y'all speakin' this nonsense
And we don't even need to see when you drop shit
We was in another country 'sleep when you dropped it
Or fuckin' some foreign-ass freak when you dropped it
I'm busy tryin' to see SportsCenter, the top ten
You niggas is boxed in, you see that we locked in

[Verse 2 - Hodgy Beats]
Murderin', that's my hobby
Don't shoot, you sloppy
I'm clear like El Debarge with a drug charge
I'm Michael Phelps smokin' to keep my lungs open
Always talk with a trash-mouth
Talk while takin' the trash out
I'm deep in the game pussy, nigga you assed out
And I'mma fuck her 'til she passed out in my glass house
I cause ruckus. The fuck is that 'bout?
Who let the mu' fuckin' cats out?
I'm in your neighborhood smokin' wood for the greater good
The greater good is on the greener side
You see where I'm, headed in that direction, a nice selection
Resurrection, after sex erection
If any nigga think they shit premium
I'll bring Speedy Gonzales out for an evening run
Let you be my son
Fuck a number stay with the beeper son
And I got these Franklins to count, make sure Aretha come
Yeah
