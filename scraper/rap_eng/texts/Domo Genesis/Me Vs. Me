[Intro]
Loot doot doot doot doot doot

[Verse 1]
It's like I got my brain in a grip, you know
Me Vs. Me: the most dangerous shit
My whole attitude stink and I ain't changing my shit
You can't blame me for being crazy 'cause I came from this shit
Take what I get so I ain't thankful for shit
And this ain't never been about no fucking chain and a whip
I'm aiming for which target turn my pain into bliss
Keep hunting till I lay in the ditch
Swear this game is a bitch

[Chorus]
I've been worrying about the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
And I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often
Seem like I been worried 'bout the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
And I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often

[Verse 2]
I'm the under-celebrated greatest, saver the latest
The reason that you sayin' graces: me
Business is usual ain't no game to play with
Swing for the fences, I'm covering all the bases A to: Z
Full totality what you thinking don't rattle me, I'm so tranquil
I'm locked in like I'm Kurt Angle on your ankle
The frame of mind that I seem to stay inside need a appraisal
Getting high, as long as my heart-rate is stable
Watch me yanking out the cable
Fuck a pawn in the game
Run the credit up a hundred put it all on my name
Charge hard like an all-star, it's all in the game
All in my brain, I know it's hard but I hardly get change
I'm too stubborn

[Chorus]
I've been worrying about the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
And I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often
Seem like I been worried 'bout the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often

[Verse 3]
And I got no reasons for this mood that I'm in
How they design their fucking silence
It's either get rich or die while you trying
Trying my best to shake these bad habits
I swear that I'm vying
I swear that I'm calm
But fuck with my time and I swear that's violence
So familiar with the feeling get it way too often
Ain't complacent with the safety I be way too cautious
Watch me flourish even when the picture ain't too gorgeous
You lil' niggas couldn't paint these portraits
I'm Bob Ross with it
Walking tall on these promises till all get it
Big dogs stompin' like Clifford while you get lost in it
Nigga my heart's in it
So it's easy to tell that you aren't authentic

[Chorus]
I've been worrying about the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
And I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often
Seem like I been worried 'bout the pay too often
'Cause niggas out here sleeping on the wave too often
I reiterate the shit I have to say too often
I get way too complacent in my ways too often

[Outro]
Wait hold on one second let me text my-
Uh, this nigga back
