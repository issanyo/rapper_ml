No one could stop it
No one could stop it
Keep my eyes on the prize and no one could stop it
And no one can stop it
Like a bottle rocket
Way down from the bottom drug it out
The mud
Hopes what without but ain't no
Doubt inside my blood
Back against the wall and neck tall
Water floods
Not even a dollar off of fear, Faith, &
Love
Ion even own a dream
I’m just wildin' off a rental
I’m a bird singing songs on the illest instrumental
I’m just sitting in my mind
Like a underlying issue
Pressure screaming so high it’s quiet like a dog whistle
But i’m still
Ten toes to it running
Stayed a hunned'
When picture had in front of me was ugly
Wouldn’t hug me
You better love me while i’m still alive
Used to run that tank empty now its filled with pride…
Imma shoot for the stars
Like a bottle rocket
Like a bottle rocket
Like a bottle rocket
Ima light up the sky
Like a bottle rocket
Like a bottle rocket
Like a bottle rocket
Ima go for what’s mine and
No one could stop it
No one could stop it
No one could stop it
Keep my eyes on the prize and no one could stop it
A bottle rocket…

All I got is my fear and faith
Try not to sleep these ideas away
Read all the signs tryna clear the way
It’s a fight that i’m still in today
I swear to god I was meant for this
And y'all was meant to be witnesses
My peace of mind is your opinion miss
This dream of mine is so intimate
Lord!
Keep me safe away from my enemies lord!
Tryna leech all this energy lord!
I been workin' for years steady facing facing these cheers
Steady shedding these tears
Now baby girl we here!
Imma shoot for the stars
Like a bottle rocket
Like a bottle rocket
Like a bottle rocket
Imma light up the sky
Like a bottle rocket
Like a bottle rocket
Like a bottle rocket
Imma go for what’s mine and
No one could stop it
No one could stop it
No one could stop it
Keep my eyes on the prize and
No one could stop it
No one could stop it like
A bottle rocket
Bout to the light fuse. I got really nothing to lose. Tired of living this blues I got
Much life to do
All of my life waiting for this. Waiting to live in happiness. Counted me out from the get go. But I believed in myself ever since so. Remember my name. Never forget. Light the fuse. Spark begins. Remember my name. Never forget. Light the fuse. Spark begins. Spark begins....
