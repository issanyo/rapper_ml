[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, no

[Verse: Domo Genesis]
I mean really what am I to do?
Okay, these words to my momma, I promised to not to lose
A born sinner, still playing like I forgot the moves
Dancing to this drum in my heart, this is such an awkward groove
No fam, really niggas ain't ready they sleep
While they wake I play that crickets, send out some blessings from me
No more stressing baby we don't smoke nothing less then a G
A hundred grand, a million dollar mind state
A couple goons on call, in case they got to boost the crime rate
America ain't never really tell me how that pot tastes
I'm looking for my destiny, take me on a blind date
Six figures making sure my mom's straight
Whole clique stepping out on point looks like it's prom date
Came a long way from getting paid doing that not say
Invested in my motherfucking self and now my stock raised
Knowing niggas steady getting guap, say
Look at me now
I got knowledge for every dollar made, so look at me now
I ain't scared of none of my flaws, that got 'em shook of me now
So if you ever had a doubt about it, it shouldn't be now (Nah)
I got 'em shook of me now
So if you ever had a doubt about it, it shouldn't be now

[Hook: Samantha Nelson & Carmel Echols]
I can't keep sitting here waiting around
Sink my feet under the ground
Keep my head under the clouds
You got to be lost where you found
I can't keep sitting here waiting around
Sink my feet under the ground
Keep my head under the clouds
You got to be lost where you found

[Outro: Samantha Nelson & Carmel Echols]
Mhhh (x8)
Yeah
