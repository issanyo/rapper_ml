Put that shit in the air, O.G. got me feeling rare
Flashy nigga, I don't care, pre-rolleds in my Domier
Louis shit for hoochie chicks who gon' flock in here
Cause they hear I'm the hottest shit that's gonna drop this year
Stop in fear, Domien the Genesis
Put flames to any shit, chiefing like I'm an Indian
I don't think I'm a quit this shit, like I invented it
Salute me gang apprentice-ship where you can't get no membership
Simple with sentences, soft spoken like bitches lips
Scathe yours, but here to take 'em back like we rented this
So where my mental is, higher than the sky is
The flyest, the flyer bitches wanna fuck a pilot
Ignite it, the weed, the medicator supplied it
The more doobie I smoke the more heavier my eyelids
Exactly what fly is, coming from the tip-top
Everybody wanna hate me like Chris Rock
Catch another O of weed at the pit stop
Wipe me down I'm blowing paper cause my shit's hot
Did you catch that? I'm scribbling outside the lines
Copped a couple G-Shocks, my bitch said I should buy some time
It's such a movie, this little exciting life of mine
Bomb main bitch and a half-asian concubine
Genesis, what is life like for you?
Raps, nice shoes, girls times two
Fly shit, recognition of my whole crew
I'm that nigga right now, watch me redefine cool, cool, cool
