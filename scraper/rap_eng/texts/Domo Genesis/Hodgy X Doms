[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Death before dishonor me and all my niggas
Conquer try to knock this and get knocked out
Then your girlfriend gon' get knocked up
(I'm not the papa)
Hodgy Daddies came here in helicopters
Smoke hella proper prescribed by your medical doctor
Hop out and get your head chopped off
That ain't real Golf Wang, that's knock off
When I pop up's when shit pops off
You're a hot dog, I'm the hottest
They hotbox while making drop offs
Don't make me call the dogs
My dogs rottweilers
Ain't shit sweet, I'm not smiling
Unless I'm out on an island
Drugs keep away my migraines
Understand the god's pain
Walk in my shoes for five days
No sleep, my mind's fried and baked
[?] I'm a pirate out the cape
So much money, need a rake
Bitch I'm hungry, bring a plate
Half an hour ago I ate
I'm an hour from being great
Fuck you sour niggas that hate
Hating cause I do what you can't

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
I made it right through the fog
Seen all my right in these wrongs
I put my life in these songs
Bitch, my savior is right in this bong
I feel it right off the strong
I'm with my white bitch getting blown
Cause we on
You niggas peons on
My niggas, we on
You niggas peon on
My niggas, we on

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I fall back, it don't call back
Like Amanda Bynes, she all that
She reminds me of my Bimmer so I check the beat, ten car facts
Park that, back it up, girl arch that
You close in range and I'm far fetched
No scope the aim in my target
To be lawless is an offset
Niggas dress to impress like corsets
I pass a bitch like courses
Lane fast, keeping up with horses
Powered inside of Porsches
Sting like bumblebees or a hornet
Bleed through the track like I torn it
Bitch you ain't in the game or the tournament
It's not you nigga, I was just born to win
And that's some gangsta shit
If I'm passing it, take a hit
Imagine the crazy shit that I do on the daily shit
It makes me sick, I make it rich and drive a Mercedes Benz
Crash and die a shady prick, Lord forgive me for all my sins
You can't judge me, you do nothing for me
It's a luxury to do something for me
I cash out at the buzzer like Robert Horry
