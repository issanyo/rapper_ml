[Verse 1: A La $ole]
They say you are what you eat
This weed is turning me into breakfast
Not fried yet within my head it gettin' feckless
Check this like a message, my flow absurd
You musta heard, I never screw up, no sir
'Cause I'm fuckin' up the game, diggin' up her skirt
Then I skirt, I erase 'em when I write this words
Ain't nothin' perfect, I'm just a regular person
But it's like I reach another God level person
My curse is cursive, no getting worst than this nigga
Never swim with sharks, cuz I fry those fish niggas, for real
This is the last hope for my niggas from Alden and
They turnin' projects into high towers like they whippin' Gina
The bullet heads still mobbin' through the hall ways
So I don't understand the image that they portray
I'm waking up to helicopters circling
That's why I'm tryna hit the airwaves
Cause some turbulence, I'm shakin'
You salty niggas, appall me, so stop talkin'
Can't fulfill the steps to what you think, you dead walkin'
Please stop, I heard you sold keys a lot
But every car renting out a key to your lot
Fuck the hottest in New York, they treat you like Newports
A spark when you started, but now you just garbage
You will tarnish, cuz New York City ain't the same nigga
I love my culture, but the changes feelin' way bigger

[Hook: A La $ole]
I'm from a place where they be gunnin' for your dome
They exploit the dope they send a shot at the chrome
So watch where you goin' when you step in my zone
Ain't nothin' nice, this is real life, I call it home
I'm from a place where they be gunnin' for your dome
They exploit the dope they send a shot at the chrome
So watch where you goin' when you step in my zone
Ain't nothin' nice, this is real life, I call it home

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I'm just tryna shake yesterday off me
Wake up and bless the 'cess like it's coffee
Up to whoever exalt me, I'm glancin' into the mirror
See what stressing, then cause me in high water
I can't rest until all this pressure is off me, man, why bother?
I'm mimickin' the steps of my father
My flat pockets probably make me break ya neck for a dollar
Respect around here is bringin' death of dishonor
And playin' death just ain't my destiny, mama
This ain't what's left for me, mama
I'm dreamin' way beyond this little street shit
A quiet kid, they couldn't see it
Just soakin' all this poison with open eyes they been feedin'
Was a step away from joining, just made my choice not to be it
But who do I believe in? The heathen?
It's only he that made the eyes even
Not me, knowing I'm caught in the breezes my season
Them dudes with more knowledge than Doms is not breathin'
I was placed here on this block for a reason and I see it

[Hook: A La $ole]
I'm from a place where they be gunnin' for your dome
They exploit the dope they send a shot at the chrome
So watch where you goin' when you step in my zone
Ain't nothin' nice, this is real life, I call it home
I'm from a place where they be gunnin' for your dome
They exploit the dope they send a shot at the chrome
So watch where you goin' when you step in my zone
Ain't nothin' nice, this is real life, I call it home
