[Intro]
It's a facade
[?] gyal if I'm not so east I'm west
From the body look what I have, know you have to God bless
[?]

[Verse 1]
Ah, these niggas must be shittin' me
Are you kiddin' me? Physically, mentally send me shots
I feel like they can't injure me, my finesse to infinity
How these niggas pretend to be?
I been carryin' this since inception, nigga, remember me?
Hoppin' out wild since 2011
Smokin' weed, dirty heathen, how I'm gon' learn a lesson?
His back snap, leave him back flat with no further stressin'
Still tryna figure if this passion is curse or blessin'
The man is savage, back at it
Gas is back, fumin'
Back to back caps, no Metro, soon boomin'
Why run from it? I can fuckin' shoot through it
I'ma smoke 'em down to ash and brush it off, a new human

[Chorus]
I swear I been doin' this shit for too long
If you think I'm losin' my shit, you too wrong
On my too-high-to-give-a-fuck-what-you-on
Tappin' in a new wave, and my rag is two-tone, ya dig?

[Verse 2]
Now, I be goin' through shit, be havin' a lot on my mind
But I'm so used to this shit, don't you worry about me, I'm fine
I get finicky, get sick when I'm not out on my grind
So I been workin' like a servant, watch my daughters recline
Recline never, I'm better, pleasure when apply pressure
Multiply my endeavors, I don't think I die ever
Livi-livin' like a screenplay, every single weekday
On the boulevard breakin' your dreams like Green Day
Really in the action, y'all niggas best watch the replay, no inglés
Put him in a sling, wait comprende, comprende?
No inglés I put 'em in a...

[Chorus]
I swear I been doin' this shit for too long
If you think I'm losin' my shit, you too wrong
On my too-high-to-give-a-fuck-what-you-on
Tappin' in a new wave, and my rag is two-tone, ya dig me?

[Outro]
Ya dig me?
