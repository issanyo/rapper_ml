[Intro]
Still sipping muddy like it ain't 4:50 in the fucking morning nigga

[Verse 1: DA$H]
Don't tell me 'bout your new tape coming cause I hate it already
Weed I put it up in the blunt then rolled, the label was deadly
I use women, abuse drugs, count up the fetti
My niggas telling me I made it, pray they never forget me
Content with being the same
Made a couple points off work, I never scored in a game
It never made me a chump, by 9th grade was a pumper
Got it bracking by May, had five racks by the Summer
My life was a blunder, I blew that shit in a week
Mix signals sending headshots soon as you thinking you sleep
My dealers living next door, the reaper right up the street
My niggas taking what we make, the price of living ain't cheap
The right hand, a Zab jab thrown to knock out his teeth
Call the dentist for dentures
All these habits I picked up from life, I'm living expensive
Leaving niggas intensive, I'm drugged up in intensive
Nigga came with the static and so we hopped him like fences
Motherfuckers know
It's Dolla, tell your bitch holla

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Bitch, Mix the Molotov with molly water
Burning awful hotter, you feel the flame
I swear I'm honest, I been that god 'fore I built my name
My hands is clean on my whole regimes from a filthy game
And real recognize real, we just do not feel the same
That petty shit ain't pressuring me
I let you pussies play yourself
Cause nothing less is what you destined to be
This rap finessing a profession to me
And lord if you really keep it G with your niggas
Then save some blessings for me
Cause I need it, on this creep course, sweet
Getting neck at Coachella inside a Jeep sport
You ain't really 'bout it my nigga, this what we bleed for
This what we sleep, drink, and eat, boy
Yeah this is exactly what you think, boy
I never seen it hotter than this
Watch me pull up on the scene with all this friction
Got the key to ignition
Middle finger to the system, what the industry missing
The best out, yeah I'm still on the mission
Play your position, nigga
Doms

[Verse 3: Remy Banks]
I remember when them cop cars was sky blue
Now my sky's blue, we smoking, high as an IQ
Or the pedestal your bitch got me on
Damn she loving the charm, like Pretty Tony with the golden arm
Flowing effortlessly, swerving on beats like I'm in a bimmer
Spitting through these Forrest Hill streets
I'm on some other shit now
Aiming for cheddar to make my world go round
Making noise with this golden sound
Catch a niggy up in Japanese fashion magazines, jiggy
I been keeping it thorough since the day that you met me
Always look him straight in the eye, cause niggas be shifty
Puffing chronic 'til my mind lose service, dog, I'm lifted
Got the world going wild cause my style's so prolific
Me and my dogs so close, we can't admit it
I just spit the most vividest lyrics, for these people that
Can't comprehend the lifestyle that I'm living
