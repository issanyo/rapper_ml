[Intro]
Ay let the, let the beat play Imma feel it more you feel me, Imma feel my swag a little more
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah you know what I'm sayin'
Ratchets they get the penis
Ratchets get the penis

[Hook]
Oooh I get money getting money for sho'
I'm getting money for sho'
And I get high
I smoke weed and get high for the low
I get high for the low
Tell a bitch word
Hell no it ain't no love for a ho
It ain't no love for a ho
Tryna get by
On my grind bitch you already know
Bitch you already know

[Verse 1]
Respect this greatness when you see it
Bitches have it and believe it
A bashful bastard passion's for giving these ratchets penis
It's a stroke of genius
Money, nothing can come between it
And we never lenient
Swear this hustle was so convenient, pimp
How dare you pussies test the odds
First one up is next to die let me testify, I feel electrified
Man I never learn cause in a loss is where the lessons lie
Flawless how I bless 'em you ain't get the steps to mess with Gods
Peasants, we on a bubble like effervescence
Everything I got is just a product of raw finess
And I manage fam
Me and money going hand in hand
Winners circle snapping pictures for the camera man

*Camera clicking sounds*
"Pose for the camera"
"Doms! Doms!"
"Doms look!"

[Verse 2]
Get off my nuts and let me breath for a second
Young and gifted, thought this was Christmas eve for a second
Just had a plate already fiending for seconds
On the low like I was sneaking a weapon
I only speed to regression, I'm vexed
Jackie Joyner used the burners when chasing a check
Niggas chasing the couchie retracing my steps
Bitch you playing to lose cause you playing the best
Talking 'bout some bending the rules bitch I'm breaking the necks
Spit it out like emphysema
I got a strict demeanor fire my desire like Rick and Teena
Magic in a dream, since a teen I'm like that witch Sabrina
I'm a legend in these Bapes, Stan Smith Adidas
Who you barking at
I'm a new era you a starter cap
Fitted for the ride nobody got your back
We running up the money
Word to my nigga Josh Peas ain't nothing funny

And I do my thang, yeah
And I do my thang
All niggas is bitches
And I do my thang
And I, and I, nigga and if I had to freestyle
You would have to pay me cause it ain't free now
Cause I'm a, nigga you gotta pay me
Or my publishing
Cause I need that money to live
Nigga gotta pay bills
Lights and gas and water
I need all of that, I need all of that
I got a baby momma and some kids and they need all the money so I gotta rap
And you gotta buy it
And you gotta like it
I got white girls just suckin' on my privates
And I'm violent
God damn what's wrong with Dom's mind
I'm insane, I'll hit a bitch in a spine nigga
And I climb up the tree like a monkey
Nigga and the swag hella funky
Your bitch got the dumpy
She look like she got the mumps, B
And I come through in a Humvee
With dumb sneaks
I'm outta here

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
They don't show a nigga love they saying his rhymes sinister
Administer the signs of diminishing prime ministers
I sit in the studio for weeks and cop literature
Snortin' miniature lines of ideal scripture
Yeah, I write it all in my will
Write it 'till its written my passenger rights like a bill
I'm in charge like a rhino in a harness
A gladiator in a gauntlet
Kill every contestant that wanna contest
I don't strip that bitch naked she chose to undress
Once fixated on hatred I've come to confess
Now we fixated on greatness and bundles of checks
The young man's rumbling next
Fight trials 'till he's humbled at rest
I'm out fuckin' with your mumbling bitch
It was a beat now it's a run over nest
Take a hit and know the blunt smoke is hexed

[Hook]
