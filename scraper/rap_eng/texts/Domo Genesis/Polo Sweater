[Verse 1: Michael Christmas]
Now who dropped the top on the foreign Mazda? Not me
Don't got Balenciaga, on two different drugs but I'm chuggin' water
Stop please, might influence your mama
Got game for that ass like Madden replay
That nigga got jokes like DeRay
Starburst juicy, she look like Lucy
Told the cutie 'scuse me, she said "beat it groupie"
I hope I don't come ass thirsty, firstly
I just wanna say your breath smell like a jersey
Some shit game on Jerome Kersey
One day I'll be rich like Percy
Grape smash, petty cabbers I wave past
I hate math, it's a problem my brain blast
I take baths, big bubbles cost double
Big broke, but bitch niggas is in trouble

[Chorus: Michael Christmas]
They ain't gon' act like that forever
They'll switch up when a nigga touch cheddar
Let 'em try to come back then, they know better
Warm ass sleep like I'm in a 'lo sweater
The only that's gon' change is the weather
Let 'em come back, I know they know better
Take my friends, pink Range with the leather
Let 'em come back, I know they know better

[Verse 2: G Perico]
Ain't shit changed with the money that I just made
They love you when you broke but they change when you get paid
Jealous, selfish, grow me a neck and helpless
Y'all playin', I'm tryna take it to another level
Seen this shit when I was little
I come from a hood where your best friend'd kill you for crumbs
That's nothin', y'all ain't never seen money
Niggas think ten-thousand is somethin', get fly then you down to nothin'
I remember when my bag ran low
They was happy, thought it was all over
I came back better, cars got faster
No tents, son, got my neck glowin' in traffic
I'm big-ballin', you niggas got big problems
Seen who was real when I was sittin' at the very bottom
If you keep talkin' 'bout me to your bitch, she gon suck a nigga dick

[Chorus: Michael Christmas]
They ain't gon' act like that forever
They'll switch up when a nigga touch cheddar
Let 'em try to come back then, they know better
Warm ass sleep like I'm in a 'lo sweater
The only that's gon' change is the weather
Let 'em come back, I know they know better
Take my friends, pink Range with the leather
Let 'em come back, I know they know better

[Pre-Verse: Domo Genesis]
Whoa, ay
Goddamn, yeah, uh, ay
Real shit, ay
Real shit, ay
Real shit, ay
Got the function smellin' like Fresh Prince hair
Real shit, real shit

[Verse 3: Domo Genesis]
You really coulda been a player, but that ain't yo place
I hit the jank and make it shake like an M-1 tank
Havin' a really great time, but I'm blank on face
The only way I laugh now is on the way to the bank
Do you honestly, wanna take a little ride with me?
Get high with me in my city?
Wavy like the fade that's on Sean Diddy Comb's hair
I want it all, like, is you gon' eat your cornbread?
The whole world, Craig
How I secure it way too sick, you can't cure it, embrace it, it's fluid
You late to get a taste of the purest game laced to the fullest
Look at the plate that I'm pullin'
Deep shot for the shooters like I play for the Bullets
Long range with the gold aims
Fresh ass white T, that's my codename (in my white tee)
And I'm mobbin' with the whole gang
Fuck a rap check, I'm finna blow the whole thang

[Chorus: Michael Christmas]
They ain't gon' act like that forever
They'll switch up when a nigga touch cheddar
Let 'em try to come back then, they know better
Warm ass sleep like I'm in a 'lo sweater
The only that's gon' change is the weather
Let 'em come back, I know they know better
Take my friends, pink Range with the leather
Let 'em come back, I know they know better

[Outro]
Real shit, real shit, real shit
[?] [Espa√±ol]
If you keep talkin' bout me to your bitch, she gon suck a nigga dick
You really coulda been a player, but that ain't yo place
Grape smash, petty cabbers I wave past
They'll switch up when a nigga touch cheddar
Let 'em try to come back then, they know better
