[Sample]
Um só coração, um só pensamento
Subirá até vós
Um só coração, um só pensamento
E todas as dores se acalmarão

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I ain't got no fucking friends, trusting these niggas?
You better pissing in the wind, keep opening your circle so big
You'll never win, especially getting in and they begin to pretend
Like they in to the end, they grin being jealous a sin
That's why I ride alone, I'm in the highest zone
Cause I don't need a shoulder, I need a microphone
I'm getting high alone would spend my nights alone
I ride or die and whip that bitch until the tire's gone
Can't even pimp it in my kicks don't even try 'em on
You would diminish in the instances that I have grown
Inside my mind it's like a firestorm
To cross my boundaries get fired on, you know your rights and wrongs
Peace to my fam, it's O.F. until the planet blows
I'm so loyal, I can't even understand it, yo
Even though they everywhere I go
I'm still feeling like I stand alone, I feel so damn alone (OOPS)
In front of a couple thousand kids that I never seen
To see them nod they heads is a fucking dream
And even though everything is still everything
I steadily feel like it ain't really what it fucking seems
The game is just a bunch of pretty walls
After initial, now the cheating niggas begin to see his flaws
I see within my friends the drama that this shit can cause
And that's not the reason we got into this shit at all
We're all alone seeing the power of this platform
Tryna get a little shine off of these rap songs
That's just how it goes, it doesn't last long
If we can stay tight we got it to fall back on
Our journeys are all different
Bunch of different plans, but we share the same vision
See it ass you see it, I don't pay it attention
I'm advancing my position feeling like a solo mission, I'm alone
Ain't nobody handing me shit I got my own
O.F. is the fam and that's it we stand alone
Even though my camp is legit I feel alone
Why do I feel alone? I feel so damn alone
