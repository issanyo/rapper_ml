I'm a buffalo soldier, a buffalo soldier
I walk around in this world with my gun out the houlster
All the way to my soldiers, but fuck it I hold up
Fuck the world for what it's worth until this bitch over
But I don't wanna grow up, but I only get older
The world getting colder, my heart is all froze up
I wear it on my sleeve, but i keep my sleeve's rolled up
I be on my work like the dealer is coked up
I been on the search for whoever is so tough
Forever is so much, I hope it don't slow up
I hope that it last you everyday like the sure one
And stand in that motherfucking heat 'til the storm come
I'm living like Bear Gryll's, Man VS Wild
Take no demands where I stand, no help planning it out
I do this shit for myself, can't understand it, then fuck you
Do what the fuck you want, cause either way they gon' judge you
Stay inside your lane and watch the stars from the sunroof
Believe it in your brain, it will possibly come true
Sound corny as fuck, but I ain't tellin' lie
I'm just telling you exactly what I see with my eye's
One of the illest alive, woooop
