[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Catch me wilin' wit my woadies, carryin' fillet, fully loaded
I push that power trip up to the limit, still I'm focused
Villain with the motive if you feel heroic
See, I ain't gotta be convinced and I was in before I wrote it, bitch
Winning board, back to the business, boy, what you winnin' for?
Don't feel the aura, pure to your gimmicks, boy, with the image for
Forgive me, lord, living my life, that means I'm sinning more
A scary nigga, doubting my mind, I never been before
I'm tour swag, had the vision packed from the jump
I left them actors dust, only way I look back and discuss
Fuck the [?] act, going back to black and turning madness up
I've had it up to h-, I'm back to crash and through your traffic rush
Screaming "move, bitch, get out the way!"
I'm 'bout to cause a scene when I bring the truth out to play
Getting highly medicated out the way
Bitch, we win the game tryna draw you out to play, big me
Never liar, human-made attire
In that visage, you won't got a best use by a day decided
Never liar, human-made attire
In that visage, you won't got a best use by a day decided

[Chorus: Domo Genesis]
Ripping pieces off the leaf, I'm 'bout to smoke, nigga
Ain't shit funny, but a joke, nigga
I'll be damned if I'ma die and be a broke nigga
Chasing hundred dolla bills until I croak, nigga

[Verse 2: Cozz]
Dawg, you see no frogs, just the men that be in charge
We at large, fleeing from the cars that belong to the badged and armed
Killed a couple artists and put 'em all in a morgue
Killed a lot of sergeants and now they call him the God of War
If it ain't Cozz, ignore it, what the fuck you nodding for?
All that shit is bullshit, this shit like a matador
All my shit be knocking so often you got a harder door
The type of shit you try to put cough drops in a coffin for, 'cause you know I'm sick and it kills you
You thought a sword would stop the lord from giving me all my blessings and my rewards
This why I'm often bored, y'all getting so predictable
I'm ha-ha-ing more, I know I'm bragging but to mop the floor with ya is not a chore, nigga
Lyrical toys with us, but not mature children
Childish with the weapon, I'm excited when it's yelling
My saga brings diamonds and real G's to the environment


[Outro: Domo Genesis]
Ripping pieces off the leaf, I'm 'bout to smoke, nigga
Ain't shit funny, but a joke, nigga
Chasing hundred dolla bills until I croak, nigga
