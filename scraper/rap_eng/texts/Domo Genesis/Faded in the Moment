[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (multiple times)

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Girl, I know you feeling this energy
Hundred miles away and I still remember it vividly, I just pictured the imagery, we
Are just so small in this picture of life, belittles me, it's
A natural high off of these feelings you been giving me, but
I pray for feelings this good, forever-ever
Forever-ever-ever, and never tear it apart
It's kinetic, as long as we at it, we sharing a heart
Paint your picture from afar, cause together I feel it's art
As we, take it slow, babe I hoping you get these messages, cause
I'm already got me feeling R. Kelly, it's you
Killing me softly while I'm speaking it's all evidence
Got a hard nigga contemplating 'bout benevolence, but
I played my role right...
Cause I been dreaming of this shit my whole life
Seeing glimpses of the future and it's so bright
C-4 on the stove, and a coal fight, that's what we explode like
Uh

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Word to Omarion, I had an icebox where my heart at
And shawty lit a fire and I ain't know where to start at
I need to know what to call that at like a phoenix rising out the ashes
Like packed arenas with my music blasting
Like roller coasters, you screaming
All my love, you say you need it faster
Make golden moments then get weeded after
Got me faded on a feeling, oh so strong, hope that I don't get jaded, on
This melody you singing, me, I carry a cadence on
It's us, bet we ready for whatever any weather brings
We came from nothing, want to be somebody's everything
Bonds over tied us, don't need anything, set your screen
Just 1-on-1, check it up, I give you the best of me
Baby we balling, said you won't catch a player slip
But maybe I'm falling, maybe I'm all up in the zone
Maybe that's why my text-es is clogging up your phone
This love is honestly too hard to leave alone, uh

[Interlude 2]
