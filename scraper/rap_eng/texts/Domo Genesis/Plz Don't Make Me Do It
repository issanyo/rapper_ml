[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Now I still don't pop molly, but I smoke around a pound of weed
Around an hour time we'll burn the sour like calories
That money shit enpowers me, cowards, while ya'll cowardly doubted me
Swear if uncle could see me now, he'd be proud of me
But I pour some out for my dead homies
Smoking out in Flatbush, Zombies my dead homies
Rommi my bread homie
I've seen some niggas die before they crime
And if I go I'd be proud to say I put some reason in my rhymes
Believe that I'm in time my season come online
Spring, winter, fall bring any raw, see that involves snakes out the grass
[?] of the law, preach and resolve
But you niggas too hard headed, that "I want it all" fetish
Devil is still aline, I ain't going where y'all headed
I don't get what I want, I know my niggas is war ready
A couple 100 degrees, still seeming the heat is rising
Withdrawal from the fiends, they say "you can't deprive me"
This just my essence, no second guessing, please read the science
Fuck the world, smoke weed, cheat, be defiant

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Curse all of you bitch niggas
'Cause I might hurt one of you bitch niggas
Please don't make me do it
I think I'm on my old shit
They wanna see me on my old shit
Believe I'm on my old shit

Curse all of you bitch niggas
'Cause I might hurt one of you bitch niggas
Please don't make me do it
I think I'm on my old shit
They wanna see me on my old shit
Believe I'm on my old shit

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliot]
Bridge the gap between us
Always reminiscing about some old shit
Smoking good weed and you know we smoke the whole zip
Outie when the hoes dip
Know we rocking J's, know it be the old shit
Phone disconnected when you call, that's my old shit
Seeing other bitches at the mall, that's my ho shit
Know your friend is so sick, that's why I play my old shit
So when I'm dead and gone you can say you know my old shit
This is for the vultures, I do this for the culture
Not cause I'm supposed to
Soldiers never show love
There is something old 'bout a new drug
There is something rad 'bout a good fuck
Good women, good weed
That's why a nigga move at such a speed
Eyes shifty on these fiends
I disintegrate regimes
You see me move smooth when I orchestrate tunes
I'm Coltrane if he ate shrooms, I assume

[Hook: Domo Genesis]
Curse all of you bitch niggas
'Cause I might hurt one of you bitch niggas
Please don't make me do it
I think I'm on my old shit
They wanna see me on my old shit
Believe I'm on my old shit

Curse all of you bitch niggas
'Cause I might hurt one of you bitch niggas
Please don't make me do it
I think I'm on my old shit
They wanna see me on my old shit
Believe I'm on my old shit

[Outro]
Old shit
I'm on my old shit
