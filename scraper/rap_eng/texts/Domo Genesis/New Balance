[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Swear this wicked world drove me crazy
Been alone, see alone, look how strong it made me
They trying to lock my uncle up and he just had a baby
I swear you thought you see the future, get a swift 180
Nothing gets to me, been too hard to listen lately
I want it all, everything, no ifs, ands, or maybes
I just hope for better speed, the day the devil chase me
I want that old vibe, damn my memories escape me
It ain't always sunny man, the rain come
Mix the kush with the opiate, it make the pain numb
Running from my past but I be present when the train comes
Kill my fears and shoot for greatness all with the same gun
Like how much pressure can a heart take
Cross faded on that 808 and Heartbreaks
Tomorrow the world is mine like it's March 8th
I spark a fire in a dark place, Doms

[Hook: Hodgy Beats] (x2)
They say everyday is a struggle (They say everyday is a struggle)
I say everyday is a hustle (Get your money, get your money)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I repeat my genius, streaming thoughts continuous
They say you ain't working hard unless your raps is strenuous
Take it with a grain of salt, I'm known to be contemptuous
The way I ingenuously be on, it's oblivious
I give a shit, hold on to [?] both of my fists
Do I let go or grip this shit, so hard that I rip this shit
They say it's all in your head like a pigeon shit
It seems life more difficult down the stem, poisonous pricks in it
If you're hungry for money, that's because you're not getting it
Or have too much to penny-pinch, the difference is
Where do I lie, bribing my way into heaven
Give what I leave on this earth to Allah
Stacking my mighty dollars
Putting in work like a blue collar
The year of the alumni used to be a new scholar
Stopping still spinning tracks, on a spree weather shoot
Dada, I'm having a guava [?] nada

[Hook] (x2)
