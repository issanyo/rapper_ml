[Gait√°n Verse]
Watch me, watch me (hey)
I know you wish you could watch me
Watch me,  watch me
Stop, stop me (oh)
I never stab me in i got this flow

See me watch fer me far
See me pull in my car
Know me you see me fall around
But i'm too far

Watch me pull my team
(Watch me, watch me, watch me)
Pull see my fear
Do you could me now
If you fucking with my team now
Can i feel like a kid

Touch you ask me for a free
I can see will me watch me now
Like a fucking with my team now
