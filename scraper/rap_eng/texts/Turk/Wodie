I’m from the part of California that ain’t made it rapping
Come around here and a nigga gon’ ask you what’s racking
Everybody territorial inhospitable
You can try to creep but you end up in the hospital though
Chopper city here to everybody who bout wearing blue
Hard to get a dollar when the enemies want you
San Diego pack up for you, south east, Logan Avenue
Republican them a muhfucka, they’ll do away with you
So here I am Mr. Hot Boy riding round in some new
Quarter mill of em G’s won’t help when they watching you
Mostly these niggas pimpin out these, most city bitches hoeing
These niggas here they ain’t doing that, just D bone and keep going
My nigga Turk call ‘em wodie, I call ‘em homie
He earned that the night he clocked on, them niggas for me
So confrontational to life, look in my section
Just know when you see Mitchy he riding with protection
