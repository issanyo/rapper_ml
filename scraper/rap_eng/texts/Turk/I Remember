[Intro]
Hot boy, hot boy
If you ain't want to be a hot boy you a not boy nigga
Let's go
I remember as a youngin, hot boy
I remember as a youngin, hot boy
I remember as a youngin, hot boy
I remember as a youngin, hot boy

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I remember as a youngin, I just wanted to be a hot boy
Now I’m fucking with my nigga Turk, thug life, Pac voice
I remember as a youngin, I just wanted to be a hot boy
Now I’m fucking with my nigga Turk, thug life, Pac voice

[Verse 1: Turk]
I remember as a youngin, yeah nigga been a hot boy
From the projects young and thugging
Wet a pussy nigga block up
In a stolen van doing capers, I did it myself with no favors
In my city I swear they got haters, swear I never been a hater
Nigga killed my brother Ralo, I was fucked up
Wanted to ride on that nigga
I was locked up, couldn’t do nothing
Probably never would forgive him
Catch a case to go where he at
Get on that list just to visit
Look that young nigga in his eyes
Ask him why the fuck he did it
Nigga I’m the business, yeah I’m the business
Give your nigga’s ass the business
Getting money, stacking bills every day
Nigga I’ma keep getting it
Don’t talk on no phone, do no texting, they snitching
On IG quoting out prices, don’t let them catch you slipping
Foreign whips I’m whipping, flickidy flickidy wrist I’m whipping
Not no GD, no vicelord, no blood, I ain’t tripping
Just a real nigga fuck with real niggas
No joke nigga, no kidding
My ghetto past straight every state
Nigga we relate, I’m ignant

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I remember as a youngin, I just wanted to be a hot boy
Now I’m fucking with my nigga Turk, thug life, Pac voice
I remember as a youngin, I just wanted to be a hot boy
Now I’m fucking with my nigga Turk, thug life, Pac voice

[Verse 2: Sy Ari Da Kid]
My block hot as May weather
Money team, I am not Floyd
20 bottles in our section
Got me looking like Cîroc boys
I remember as a youngin, I just wanted to be a hot boy
Now I’m fucking with my nigga Turk, thug life, Pac voice
RIP, my boys, they knowin' I’m the new captain
I’m wildin', Blade got shot, he was up at the hospital laughing
My bitch from the islands, I call her tropical passion
When you come from where I’m from, you either a cop or you trapping
We got whatever for the low, but not if you ratting
2K only, ain’t finna buy the new Madden
Dump died cause a ho nigga, think I got to move past it
Might cop a new mask, I’m driving too fast, I’m riding through blasting
Want it all, I ain’t asking, off the meter like a taxi
Niggas tell me I be taxing, and I don’t even pay my taxes
(What you say nigga?)
Off the meter like a taxi
Niggas tell me I be taxing, and I don’t even pay my taxes

[Chorus: Sy Ari Da Kid]
I remember as a youngin, I just wanted to be a hot boy
Now I’m fucking with my nigga Turk, thug life, Pac voice
I remember as a youngin, I just wanted to be a hot boy
Now I’m fucking with my nigga Turk, thug life, Pac voice

[Outro: Turk]
Nigga killed my brother Ralo, I was fucked up
Wanted to ride on that nigga
I was locked up, couldn’t do nothing
Probably never would forgive him
Nigga killed my brother Ralo, I was fucked up
Wanted to ride on that nigga
I was locked up, couldn’t do nothing
Probably never would forgive him
