[Verse 2]
Damn that bitch ain’t a real bitch
That’s why I cut these hoes off like a kill switch
Then pull up looking like a meal ticket
But me and my A1 still kicking
Shout out to the ones who was with me in the gutter
Ain’t had money back then you know for that I love you
Gotta put together all the pieces of the puzzle
Down twenty punch, still chilling at the buzzer
I know they gon’ ride cause they realer than most
Haters pointing at me, I can feel the poke
Splitting that crack, they wanna hit this dope
Jump the fake niggas man they choke till they croak
Get money stay real, make it rain on my face
They the only ones saw the pain through the most
When bitches that broke cad my back like a coke
Now I’m back like a ghost

[Bridge]
Nigga money don’t make me, I make money
And it don’t mean shit if my niggas ain’t stuntin’
If my niggas ain’t stuntin’, don’t mean shit if my niggas ain’t stuntin’
Nigga money don’t make me, I make money
