[Verse 1:]
My future's finally clear, even with my eyes shut
I won't question high ideas, they go and chose us
So realize and use us, the words of the mistress
The words that was written all as a statistics
Seen the better side of life, I experience the worst
God must have saved something for me for what is worth
Ex cocaine, hell run eighty just up in eighty
No matter what state I was in I was up in edit
Might know your brain, was in my teens when I started tootling
The money ain't a thing, came in and start shooting
Got this track on my arm and maybe you can feel me
Made me honest with that, addiction tried to kill me
No affection in my brain, information in my heart
How could I be so bright, the future looked so dark
When hospitalized for my deeds I was moving in high speed
Seeing shit dope through high Vs
I know I come a long way for me to talk about it
You been through what I been through? But I doubt it
Ah, it don't mean that I'm better than you
I just read the prescription of the man, it all work through

[Hook:]
But if I had to do it all again
But if I had to do it all again
But if I had to do it all again

[Verse 2:]
There be time interpretation of my life
Says that I've seen the Passion of Christ with millions
And record sales to the consumer drug sales
To seeing loved ones die while in jail
Know how it feels to have a child that you barely hail
And how it feel when left on betray
Now I know how it feel to probail
Now I know hot it feel when God take you high, set a movie scale
I've been on a journey but I realized life's just a long sometime to see the heart to meet
I put you alone
I'm feeling thug into the microphone
Taking hardship using God's gifts
Inspite a nigga that turns
Got his YNT vision that gotta be fulfilled
Like the 22 years got on to turn on the bill
So miss me with the fake shit, cause I can't take it
I'm thanking God for my experience for living reckless

[Hook:]
But if I had to do it all again
But if I had to do it all again
But if I had to do it all again
