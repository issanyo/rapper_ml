[Verse 1: T.Y.]
Jet Life nigga
Look
For (?)
Full of that Bape shit, I go ape shit
Got a hustler's mind so I knew I was gon' make it
Stop worrying bout mine cause that ain't how you gon' make it
You wasting your time if you be with all that hating shit
You ain't here for none of them problems
Cause see that paper with them blue stripes
Nigga we tryna pile 'em
My dog came round in a hottie
I got the burners and the masks my nigga lets do a robbery
Jack these niggas out of they pride
Give it to my lil homies they on the rise
It'll be your ass if you run your mouth to them guys
50 shots will set it off
Another 50 it's just oh Lord

[Chorus: T.Y.](x2)
I'm bout whatever
You bout whatever you want we could do it
Keep it a hundred, nigga and I ain't gotta prove it
Tryna shine on me that's gon' have you looking stupid
Couple of hittas with me ain't gon' hesitate to use i

[Verse 2: Turk]
I'm bout whatever you bout nigga all day and all night
Fed time and I'm on my third strike
Keep it ten times a hundred nigga
If I speak on it best believe I done it nigga
I ride strapped, I don't trust none of you niggas
Run up on me if you want but I'll punish you nigga
I be an untamed gorilla
Bout slanging that iron and getting rid of you nigga
I got some hitters on direct message
Send the word and they coming nigga armageddon
If a nigga try me, try me
Imma smack his whole team, get a few bodies

[Chorus: T.Y.](x2)
I'm bout whatever
You bout whatever you want we could do it
Keep it a hundred, nigga and I ain't gotta prove it
Tryna shine on me that's gon' have you looking stupid
Couple of hittas with me ain't gon' hesitate to use it
