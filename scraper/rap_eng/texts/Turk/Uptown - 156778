[Verse 1:]
Take a ride through the hood, high nty
He given up them deals on the occupy
My nigga knowledge not far, probably riding in the car
Talking on the cellphone, rolling up another blunt
With the jag boys on it, we can do it with you
I give my niggas money and shawty, they roll it on you
Can get started on dawn, only, ride street harmony
Boom sack anyday, all the way to six three
Apple jacket wild, with the first to make it pop
Nigga still got blow, put virgin assault
My nigga vito, when y'all gonna see
That other tech nine that I used to be
That one on one rescue, you six feet deep
For nigga bit clip, that clip on your hip
Rest in peace, stupid J and set them dice
Yellow boy was a fool, soldiers slim with nuts

[Hook:]
Long time, nigga, let bite in
We don't talk to the fat boys
And them niggas shine
Suck them bully, my nigga little ride in
Drop the big shout and I bring you back about it
Long time, nigga, let bite in
We don't talk to the fat boys
And them niggas shine
Suck them bully, my nigga little ride in
Drop the big shout and I bring you back about it

[Verse 2:]
Everything's strap when you're spinning the bent
Enough men chosen a fin rap over cali
You chick's been sucking the dick, we're all about moto
We get the fo-fo, the dazzing on the in more
We're sitting in my hood with the things on the bimo
You know where I be at, shout at and be that
To you, boy, holla at your rounds if you need that
You think about the kicks, now you're coming for the itch
Curios disease, we're gonna leave your blind sick
Remember Carry Lerow, she be more on that nigga cheek
They're still getting money and they ride for me
I got a thing for ocho, my thing for ocho
My thing from ocho, my chain from ocho
Ocho, nigga boy, I be wiling
Ocho, nigga boy, living violent

[Hook:]
Long time, nigga, let bite in
We don't talk to the fat boys
And them niggas shine
Suck them bully, my nigga little ride in
Drop the big shout and I bring you back about it
Long time, nigga, let bite in
We don't talk to the fat boys
And them niggas shine
Suck them bully, my nigga little ride in
Drop the big shout and I bring you back about it

[Verse 3:]
I'm an uptown nigga, living violent
Cuddos when you're setting dose, I be riding
Put your hand bill on the other side of the hill
From the thing to the thirty, homie is real
We don't play by no rules, man, we cut through
Put a nigga to sleep, that's why we're here for
Hold a hole in the street, yeah, we can call it
Still one of my niggas are stealing to you
Burgain, burg a shoe and much to bang bang
Thirty day to cali-o, about the same thing
A million thoughts through your ceiling, hit it straight thuggie
Dug it through the uptown, nigga straight thuggie
My nigga here, my nigga biggie, mad world
Them TC stay in limit, nigga, young term
Rest in peace, Wilo, that's my lil brother
Let uptown, got a whole lot of love for you

[Hook:]
Long time, nigga, let bite in
We don't talk to the fat boys
And them niggas shine
Suck them bully, my nigga little ride in
Drop the big shout and I bring you back about it
Long time, nigga, let bite in
We don't talk to the fat boys
And them niggas shine
Suck them bully, my nigga little ride in
Drop the big shout and I bring you back about it
