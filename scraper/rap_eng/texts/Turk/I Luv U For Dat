[Verse 1]
Ma I understand why you used to be so hard
Kept me inside from catchin' a charge
From day one you always said I ain't had no boys
Told me to go to church and learn about the law
Ya never... told me wrong but you told me right
Said the streets wasn't fo' me and I'll lose my life
Look here I love you for that, that's why I'm here today
And I love you for that look I mean what I say
I don't know what I woulda done with out you
I woulda run with a gun probably with out you
You my girl, you my doll, you my best friend
I can depend on you mama again and again
You never let me down no matter what it is
Don't got no where to go you would give me a place to live
And it's like that, that's why I love you girl
I would never put no one above ya girl

[Hook]
You used to make me punch da clock
I luv u for dat
I couldn't hit da block
I luv u for dat
Stayed in when it was hot
Look here, I luv u for dat
Look ma, I luv u for dat
Look ma, I luv u for dat
You used to make me punch da clock
I luv u for dat
I couldn't hit da block
I luv u for dat
Stayed in when it was hot
I luv u for dat
Look ma, I luv u for dat
Look ma, I luv u for dat

[Verse 2]
I can never pay u back for all the things u done
But I do appreciate all the things u done
Takin' care of 3 sons all by yourself
You was the daddy and the mama you ain't have no help
When times was ruff fo' us you got us through the struggle
You taught us how to luv one an other and be brothers
Just a single parent livin' in the bricks
Livin' off welfare food stamps and wicks
It was hard back then look, I ain't gon' lie
Go to school then be back in before '89
Ma how u did I don't think I coulda done it
Gotta give u ya props u a strong black woman
Look I love that women and I mean everythang
When I say she mean everythang, I mean everythang
And I'mma respect her till she dead n gone
I love you for that, that's why I wrote this song

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See when u go to jail mom still be there
She might trip a lil' while but believe she care
Always by ya side dawg when you got no one else
Even if you hurt mom she'll still be there
I don't know nobody who play it like that
If ya wrong or ya right mama got ya back
She 100 with me she'll never turn her back on me
I let her know everythang 'cuz it's like she my homie
I luv dis fam with all my heart
I don't think that can even take us apart
And that's on the real dawg that's the way I feel
I luv you for that and I'm just keepin' it real
And nuthin' or no one can steal that luv
The love that I have for my mama

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on...
