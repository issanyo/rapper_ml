[Hook:]
This one for the hood
This one for the hood
This one for the hood
This one for the hood
I'm from a place where they stay
Straight face, straight racks, straight drop
Ray back, welcome to my hood
Welcome to my hood, my hood
Everybody got a hood, make it out if you could
This one for LA, this one for Miami, this one for CA
This one for the hood, not many things to say

[Verse 1:]
For my niggas who ain't never ever hashy
We just ran up in a store and start to grab shit
Young nigga, strapped with a gun, nigga
Caught up in an L bleed, but instead that killed him
Bounce in, trying to get a job, fuck the nine to five
He just trying to get that bag served with some dash
Junkers' every dope, hungry for the street
He just selling pussy cocaine hopelessly
Yeah, he's still hustling
And now you blame the nigga, cause that used to be me
Yeah, I got my shit together and you can't be me
Get up on the brick, nigga, straight up on the blind shit
I came for nothing when they label me a rich nigga

[Hook:]
I'm from my place where the space craft
Straight racks, straight drop
Ray back, welcome to my hood
Welcome to my hood, my hood, your hood
Everybody got a hood, make it out if you could
This one for Ohio, this one for LA, this one for Miami, this one for CA
This one for the hood, not many things to say

[Verse 2:]
This one for HOOD, hood
Blame it on the system why we misunderstood
Out of town we are not team, yeah, our dreams get shattered
Finger momma house, ulternate your life to the disaster
Niggas gotta hustle when this boss, any means
Stars turn to trap stars, gotta get the grind
Rub cream, police, till the nigga get caught
First time get probation, cause the hustlers ain't thugs
Caught up in the system but we don't give a fuck
Still thug and talking business, middle finger to the law
Dance, motherfucker, jump district and turn it prosecute
Turn to make it up, but we are no fucking lose

[Hook:]
I'm from my place where the space craft
Straight racks, straight drop
Ray back, welcome to my hood
Welcome to my hood, my hood, your hood
Everybody got a hood, make it out if you could
This one for Ohio, this one for LA, this one for Miami, this one for CA
This one for the hood, not many things to say
