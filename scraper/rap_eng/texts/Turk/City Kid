[Vocal Sample]
Another day in paradise
I'll miss you...

[Verse 1]
You know, if I could blow an O a week
Grow two feet taller
Dunk like Kobe
Get three stripes sent to me for free
Family sound asleep
Then I'll be Chilean
That's on me
I feel like all this weight on me
I can't sleep
These absent mornings
I don't see
Try to find peace
Do some Do Re Mis, only
Talking trees and sleepy people
My equals, yeah I'ma give it my best
I must be someone else
I must be someone, yeah
I must be
I should gather myself

[Chorus]
Instead I'm 2 AM and daydreaming
This nightmare couldn't lift the sun
Searching for the stars at night, yeah
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone

[Hook]
Missin' you missing out on these good times
Couldn't have had them without the bad times
And why were you so heavily involved?
Blaming them when you couldn't finish yours
Missin' you missing out on these good times
Couldn't have had them without the bad times
Oh, my
Our life, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Berkeley legend, I
Looked myself in the eyes, this
City made a man, I
Know the world is mine
Working overtime
It's my life to live
Always showing love
Fuck that spiteful shit
You could smoke a whole pound of cookies
That don't compare to how high I'm 'bout to get
Spent too many days second guessing myself
Trying to be flawless
Trying to be perfect
Spent too many days second guessing myself
Moving way too cautious
Fuck it, it ain't worth it
Foot on the gas, foot on they neck
Foot on they ass with no regrets
For the shit I coulda did in the past
Trying to make my new shit better than my last
I would sleep, but fuck that

[Chorus]
Instead I'm 2 AM and daydreaming
This nightmare couldn't lift the sun
Searching for the stars at night, yeah
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone
The city kid has gone, the city kid has gone

[Hook]
Missin' you missing out on these good times
And how did I ever battle these bad times?
And why were you so heavily involved?
Blaming them when you couldn't finish yours
Missin' you missing out on these good times
Couldn't have had them without the bad times
Oh, my
Our life, yeah, yeah
It's paradise (paradise)
Looking for nirvana-na-na
Always looking for something more
You don't need shit
But you want more

[Vocal Sample]
Another day in paradise
I'll miss you in real life
So choose the way when your hands become as cold as my heart
May your head space melt (melt)
Baby, let that ice cold shit melt (melt)
