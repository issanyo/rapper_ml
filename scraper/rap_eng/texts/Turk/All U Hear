[Hook:]
All you do is Turk this, Turk that
YNT, they're coming through
I hear you talking brand beats
Exploding every avenue
Turk this, turk that
Spill it to my head, did I made that clear?
Nigga, it's my year, no coincidence all you hear
All you do is turk this, turk that
YNT, they're coming through
I hear you talking brand beats
Exploding every avenue
Turk this, turk that
Spill it to my head, did I made that clear?
Nigga, it's my year, no coincidence all you hear

[Verse:]
Got a couple hundred bandz on my side
My slurpass tight
You niggas ain't right
And I ain't take a shit light
But I got regon rights, I'm Turk with a hell of a tune
Ain't worry about blown, I'm already blown
There ain't no top bout chromozone
Got it, I rap alone, I stay rip this on
I just showed up, gotta pack a lean, hold up
One thing about it, I ain't slowed up
Good, put your leg on my shoulder
YNT gonna hold up
Jump up on a wheel, do about a unity
Until the motherfucker close up
Matter of fact take a close up
For the shot of the brownies
All the mind, it's my time
Hold up on juries, conflicts with my shine
We're gone for a minute, nigga, now it gets down
But this round got the same niggas with when I was at the bottom
As a fact, they believe in a nigga is enough for the reason to say I got 'em
