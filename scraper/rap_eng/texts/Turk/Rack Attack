[Hook:]
Yeah, it's a rack attack
Blow stack after stack
Check my stash
The more I spend, the more come back
Yeah, it's a rack attack
Blow stack after stack
Check my stash
The more I spend, the more come back
Yeah, it's a rack attack
Throw it in the air, watch it come right back
Throw it in the air, watch it come right back
Right back, right back, right back, right back
Yeah, it's a rack attack
Throw it in the air, watch it come right back
Got a least a hundred racks in a Louis backpack
If you think that you right, go tit for tat

[Verse 1:]
50 for the Bugari, 20 more to custom the face
The price tag on Scagnetti – well over 20K
My bank rolls – it's hard for one bank to bank those
Baby over there on that strip pole –
She interested even if she ain't chose
It must be the clothes –
Spent a rack for the gator tennis shoes with the eyes in 'em
A rack apiece for the Gucci belt, shirt and jeans –
With the red and green lines in 'em
Everything I push I keep dimes in 'em
And I spend rack after rack after rack
Baby, what you want?
Jimmy Choo fitted dress with the heels to match?
All you gotta do is ask
My political party, the Euro crashed
I'm a show you how to ball to the max
Can't cut my bread with a axe
I ain't braggin', just givin' you facts
How dare you wanna see where I'm at
What, you got unlimited scratch?
I tell you what, we gon' kill all that
Let's see if you can match, rack for rack

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm in Porsche moccasins – my turbo Panamera shoes
VVS is see-through – they got a panoramic view
I'm smokin' Burmese kush – it got a tropical aroma
I'm somewhere with a dancer – gettin' it on, man, her name Fionna
She said for the 500, I could give her pussy a tour
So I gave her 500 more to get straight to the pearly gates, so mature
Yeah, it's a rack attack – when I take baby shopping, it's a rack attack
Give me one of this, give me two of that
Give me a thousand for this, twenty thousand for that
Titanium black card – you know, the preferred edition
And I ain't just part of the scene – I make preferred additions
And I'm into real estate – know I'm in the realest state
Cash overrule, huh? Bones is red
I got too many hoes, and they mash the 'caine
Ain't nothin' to get a million on my fade
Got me in that association
Keep real niggas 'round me – you could call it insulation
Would you kill for a rack? Real talk, no exaggeration
You made the front page – my nigga, congratulations

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Free BG!
It's a rack attack
It's a rack attack
It's a rack attack
It's a rack attack
