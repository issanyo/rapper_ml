Scream
Living in the streets, they told me I wouldn’t be shit
Even if I did  they told me it wouldn’t be quick
Running for the money, they told me I wouldn’t see shit
Leather Maserati and still can’t see shit
I don’t give a fuck what they talking, tell them come holla
Fuck nigga forever broke won’t give them a dollar
Be a fuck nigga, I can’t (I can’t, I can’t I can’t)
Real rich nigga, one hundred
Living in the streets, they told me I wouldn’t be shit
Even if I did  they told me it wouldn’t be quick
Running for the money, they told me I wouldn’t see shit
Leather Maserati and still can’t see shit
I don’t give a fuck what they talking, tell them come holla
Fuck nigga forever broke won’t give them a dollar
Bout to get their bitch ass schooled, not talking no scholar
Had the minis hop out the ship into an Impala
I don’t condone fuck shit so I don’t feel ya
Niggas you thought had lover are planning to kill ya
Before they kill me, I’m a set it off on ‘em
Low ills over here I put a mouse on em
Word to Turk they’ll end up murky, could be work
Fuck around and and lift up your skirt yeah he loves dirt
Check up dirt do what they worth
Greenlight light and the hood going berserk
Whoa, from Texas to the end though I block like a limo
But when we connect is a problem nigga
We came from the mud, out the block from the club
A house full of drugs and we’re robbing niggas
I came here one hundred but now we’re one thousand
How do they see me go check about me
My words they be falling, same gangster regardless
I’m bout that respect, try to take without me
I came in one hundred but now I’m one thousand
Ask how they go see me, go check about me
My words they be falling,same gangster regardless
I’m bout that respect, try to take without me

Sweeper
Look, real niggas do real things
So I gotta keep it one hundred
Nigga ain’t never taking nothing from me
All I’m trying to do is make money
I ain’t never had shit, snatch and grab
Pistols all over my mattress
And I stack real, got a bad bitch
Now I’m flexing, talking cash, shit
Yeah, my money stacking like legos
My bud stretching like play dough
Have couple sticks like Eggo’s
Get money, stay real just like my nigga Turk, Im thuggin’
I ain’t never had no home training
I’m not acting out when in public
In the streets I got this shit covered
Nigga gon’ roll like sex with no rubbers
I’ll be the nigga ass like his mother
Snitching niggas get they ass smothered
Aye, better ask somebody, if you ask somebody
Cause when I grab that shorty
That’s when you get bodied

[Hook 1]
Seem like ya’ll holla who real
