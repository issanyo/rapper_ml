Ridin on twenties
Memphis and New Orleans we gonna show you how we do this

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Y'all Know the motherfuckin score bitch
Y'all boys y'all boys ain't ready for this
Hot Boys Hot Boys gunnin with the Three 6
40 Cal. in my draws runnin from them laws
A clip is rolled in my sock, im hoping that I don't fall
I'm certainly hittin corners, hittin gates, shit is dirty, plenty tight
Leapin tall buildings in a single bounce still I see them lights
Hear me this if I go I better go in style
But in Tennessee another bugged out nigga stunts

[Verse 2: B.G. and Lil Wayne]
{​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​B.G.}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

{​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Lil Wayne}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Ridin at nighters in two red Vipers
{​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​B.G.}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
They gonna expect two snipers splittin heads like this
Puttin they clique in a blender bustin gats like this
{​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Lil Wayne}​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Full of that danger in all black like this
Hot Boys and Three Six klick-klack like this, what?

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Soze Lord cause the weak competitors come on a regular
Intruders face these barracudas hundred wicked predators
Double barrel bust that warned them
Now they surely scared of us
Seriously we party stay out the streets or face the territory
Cowards of the hour sickened by my tower flower power
Shower and devour face the boom boom boom power
Tear da Club up Thugs kickin it with the Hot Boys
Cause our weapons weigh a ton and we came to bring the noise bitch

[Verse 4: Turk]​​​
I'll wet a nigga block for anything me and my Hot Boy clique
Quick to dress in all black and drop a nigga like shit
Two time on a thug nigga, bout it since my younger days
Been pullin triggers, been runnin thru the hallways
Playin it raw sparkin at anytime
Any place any where with my fuckin 9
I got an army of niggas with automatic gats
Bout splittin head ass niggas Craig, Ron, and Randy
Hot Boys and Three 6 they teamed up realer
Wanna start beef its a must we freeze it up realer

[Verse 5: Juvenile]
Strangle the trigger, and you a nigga now who did it?
Motherfucker no stomach they too scary to admit it
Rearview mirror fucked up so I can't see when they coming
Yesterday I got spooked out and drew down on an old woman
I told the lady "Look im sorry Miss I knew I was wrong
But you came so fuckin close to me I thought it was on."
Thats why my partners is gone ,they didn't see the evil approaching
And a nigga got em if it was me I would have smoked him
Stop all the snorting cause he couldn’t catch no drain
Now motherfuckers sticking syringes in his veins
Shitty pampers and tampons found all around by the dumpster
Wrapped up in a garbage bag they found a innocent youngsta
I'm an all around hustla get paid in many ways
Knew a Dre to get played, had a connection with Yae
Once before I went in a house and killed four
Hit the nigga for thirty whole that he kept under the floor
Now im with the Three 6 mob pushin them birds
Niggas done made a come up Hot Boys from the 3rd

[Verse 6: Juicy J]
Its the Juice comin up out the dark from apart
North Memphis niggas always hard and we start
Weak ass cowards, playa haters, we ain't no traitors
Bustin hustlas and some G's chasers about that paper
Pass that weed if you a friend of me
You see Big Triece kill a fifth of Hennesey
And get bucked wild in the club thats how we be
All you gang niggas throw them thangs and show them teeth
Its on

[Verse 7: Baby]
Niggas be sizin niggas ridin I'll sign on niggas
But I'll die for a few niggas:
Suga Slim, Manny, and my Hot Boy Clique
Never forget my B.G. cause I know he'll kill a nigga ma for me bitch
But today im with Three 6 and im showin love
Where these Tennessee ho suck dick till they see blood
Wearin my black glove, in case I gotta bust a niggas head cuz
Niggas buyin Bentlies on dubs, TV's with VC's is a must
Automatic strap plus, and keep my soldiers on my feet no matter what
Juve got four and B.G. got ten, while my thirty-two golds nigga we all in
Turk got the red beam team, double R Rolls Royce showin love
Went to Miami and bought a Lambergini on dubs
Niggas ridin buttons to show these hoes we worth somethin
And my baby momma the bitch play too many games
Said she was takin pills now she pregnant again
But its all gravy baby
And my children gonna be straight
If im blind deaf or crazy baby
