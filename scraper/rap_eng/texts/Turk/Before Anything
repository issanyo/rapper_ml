If you only knew my struggle, you would respect my hustle (you would respect my hustle)
I got it out the mug, ain't nobody gave me nothin' (ain't nobody gave me nothin')
A lot of sweat and blood, nigga, came with the muscle (came with the muscle)
I made it through the flood, now you bitch niggas in trouble (now you bitch niggas in trouble)

[Verse 1]
Wait
Left a nigga drowning, but I made it out the flood (I made it out the flood)
Ain't nobody gave me nothin', had to get it out the mug (get it out the mug)
Back when I was druggin', man I did so many drugs (I did)
Lotta nigga turn they back on me, even my own blood (that's fucked up)
That's why I don't got no love for you niggas, I got slugs (bang, bang, bang, bang)
And I heard they fear what, so I'm sweepin' for the bugs (sweepin' for the bugs)

And the jury undecided, only God can be my judge (hol' up, nigga)
Now you bitch niggas in trouble (a-ha), I'm the quaterback in the huddle (a-ha)
Wanna go to war, let's tuggle nigga (let's tuggle nigga, let's tuggle nigga)
