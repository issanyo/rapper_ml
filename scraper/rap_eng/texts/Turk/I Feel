And if these niggas feel like we feel, then y'all niggas real
Cause we feel like this here

B.G.:
I feel like niggas can't fuck with me
I feel like someone wanna be B.G
I feel Lil' Wayne will burn yo block so quick
I feel Turk will be quiet and take yo shit
I feel Juve will catch you slipping and unload the tech
I feel a big ass helicopter on the set
Sometimes I don't even know how I feel
But I feel if you hating shit goin' get real
I feel like goin' buy me a brand new car

I feel like the Hot Boy$ them should be the president
I feel like burning up yo body to leave no evidence
I feel like money is the most important thing next to my seater
I feel like I should have no bald head tramp up in my beamer
And I also feel that I'm also real
Ain't no rollie like my rollie, noone live like I live
And I, I feel that I'm one of a kind
I feel like niggas call shot but they ain't got bitches like mine
I feel like tonight I'm goin' ride, ride
