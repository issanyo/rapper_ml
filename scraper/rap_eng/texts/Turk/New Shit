[Chorus:]
My money old but I got me a new bitch
My money old but I got me a new crib
My money old but I just bought a new whip
My money old but I stay getting new shit
New shit, stay getting new shit (new shit)
New shit, stay getting new shit (I do)
New shit, I stay in some new shit
My money old but I stay getting new shit

[Verse 1:]
04 neutral with some new vogue
Vacate later same on them new hoes
Tell a hater man I bite like an alligator
Yeah I’m sharp as a bitch, brand new kicks
Brand new kicks to kick a brand new A
Young Turk, still 30 they don’t get a pass
You was built to make a quilt
I was built to last
Old money, cash money blast from the past
Tell a bitch real quick act like she know me
Couple drinks in the club say no she knew me
Going on that patron man is running through me
New pot to piss in and that bitch too big
New crib, 3 storeys
Two words no worries
One man, one life
YOLO blow it in one night

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
99 bling bling, diamond everything
Vacay later still doing the same thing
In yo brain getting brain from your mace weed
Sucker so cold bitch get a brain freeze
Put the money on the line, I’ll take the call
And if they charge mine I’ll take the fall
Great grand daddy and they shoot the ball
Bad bitch look cold tell em take it off
In the strip club I make them bees buzz
Ask that two min question might be the fuck
I’m on a roll but my money in stacks
Them dogs smelling bread and they coming in stacks
Nigga named Bing yeah that’s my best friend
How about you and her meet us at the west end
Meanwhile I’ll fly by the west wing
Fresh out the box brand new everything

[Chorus]
