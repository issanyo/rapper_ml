[Intro]
When did you started using cocaine
I started snorkeling cocaine when I graduated
But that shit almost took my life been clean 11
Years now

[Verse 1]
I had a monkey on my back and it woke me up early
Before I did anything nigga had to serve me driving
On the inner state hurting some swerve stomach
And back ache mommy encouraging calling me a
Baby giant needing my own joe is a theme get
About a half a gram or two until he gives me three
Hat to the man pull up in my Land Rover I jump in
That slim and PC was a true soldier then I go to
King fashion hot like king Jordan did a couple of
Ice whites call them three days large some people
Call it druggin but I call it thugging and that’s uptown
Living they all talking but nothing but that was back
Then nigga this is now because I don’t go through
What I went through I couldn't see a problem kick
My rabbit around normal white and brown no more
One on ones no more up and downs to be out there
Driggin and thuggin I don’t keep my habit but I’m

[Hook]
Still young and thuggin I use to be out there druggin
And thuggin I didn't keep my habit but I’m still young
And thugging drugging in public thuggin like fuck it
They saying I was a dorphine but then I say I was’nt
I had money I was doing me livin my life like a real HP
Started out smoking then I went to snorkling then I
Went to spiking you know that I like it scratching it
Itching holes done diggin back in old days you know
What’s kicking now we doing shows loading in every
City

[Verse 2]
Me Craig Warner I had my niggas hit me strapped like
Jeff AK’s and 50’s If a nigga die wrong then you know
We got to stitch it
But that was back then nigga this is now nigga this is
Not If I never never go what I went through consider
It proud I kick my habit round no more white and brown
No more one on one no more up and downs to be out
There driggin and thuggin I don’t keep my habit but I’m

[Hook]
Still young and thuggin I use to be out there druggin
And thuggin I didn't keep my habit but I’m still young
And thugging drugging in public thuggin like fuck it
There ain’t nothing change but the habit
Ain’t nothing change but the habit
Ain’t nothing change but the habit
Nigga ain’t nothing change but the habit
I use to be out there thuggin and druggin
I didn't keep my habit but I’m still druggin
And thuggin I use to be out there thuggin
And druggin I didn't keep my habit but
I’m still druggin and thuggin
