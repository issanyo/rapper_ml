#JusticeForJunior
[Intro: TURK & NU SZN]
It's that deep deep story man
Uh-huh
About a child that don't have a voice no more
Justice for junior
You know, but we got you
It's for everybody that felt it in their soul like i did
If you got kids i know you felt this one

[Verse 1: TURK]
Wrong time, wrong place
Wrong child, wrong face
They ran 'em down in the store it wasn't a long chase
Five grown men against one kid, so they had 'em
Grabbed 'em, dragged 'em out the door where they stabbed 'em
Aw, it's hard to fathom he was callin' for help
People all around but he was all by himself
And no one did shit and it makes me sick
You had time to make the videos and take them pics
When the kids gettin' killed, that's the stuff you ain't do
So if you watch the shit happen it's fuck you too
From the bottom of my heart i mean that
Lord knows if i was there i would've squeezed that, believe that
All i know is now he's happy where he's going to
I'm prayin' for your mom i can't imagine what she's going through
Tears are drippin' on this track that i'm flowing to
Just share those close to you, like your suppose to do
And these killers won't do good on 'em bids
Take a life and get more time it is what it is
Get that justice for Junior
Give 'em the bids
Scarface i already told y'all no women and kids
The way the devil's takin' lives like they on sale
This deadly path of the destruction leaves a long trail
The way that i feel i thinkin' that God's failed
I don't know it must be this bronze tail, for real

[Pre-Chorus: TURK]
Don't ask why i'm stressed out
'cause his killers are still breathin'
A little innocent kid got X'd out
Don't let them walk those jails with their chest out
Snatch their soul's away, God can sort the rest out

[Chorus: NU SZN]
Whoaaaaa-ouuuuu
Are angels up in heaven
When the devils run the streets
The world goes down and down and down
Where is the love
Where's the justice
For those that fallin'
'cause karma comes 'round and 'round and 'round

[Verse 2: TURK]
Yo'
It's a story about a child in the grave and in the sand
Twenty needed help most no one gave 'em their hand
You rather take the videos to play for the 'gram
What goes around comes around like the blades on a fan
The whole world watched your expiration
There's a lot going on, tears and devastation
The store's closed, cops are under investgation
I'm just prayin' your soul reaches it's destination
Another pain verse, my heart's heavy, brain hurts
He was just a baby, it's crazy, it's gettin' worse
We sendin' love from Toronto we got the same curse
It's been always bad but lately it's gettin' way worse
No where's safe, everywhere is a gang turf
I've been to five different funerals in the same church
You heard that it's real, it wasn't a rumor
I got three words Justice For Junior

[Pre-Chorus: TURK]
Don't ask why i'm stressed out
'cause his killers are still breathin'
A little innocent kid got X'd out
Don't let them walk those jails with their chest out
Snatch their soul's away, God can sort the rest out

[Chorus: NU SZN]
Whoaaaaa-ouuuuu
Are angels up in heaven
When the devils run the streets
The world goes down and down and down
Where is the love
Where's the justice
For those that fallin'
'cause karma comes 'round and 'round and 'round

[Outro: TURK & NU SZN]
Don't ask why i'm stressed out
'cause his killers are still breathin'
A little innocent kid got X'd out
Don't let them walk those jails with their chest out
Snatch their soul's away, God can sort the rest out
So where is the love
Where's the justice
For those that fallin'
'cause karma comes 'round and 'round and 'round
