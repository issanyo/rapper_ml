[Verse 1:]
Looked like 52 entrance and exit um you know
They came in my house unannounced
You bust at the feds
I did what any other black man would have did
Hood rich
52 bullets they shot
Kicked in my door
Cuz they never said they were the cops
I didn’t know if I was being robbed or not
I hit the floor until all the popping stopped n*gga for sure
Come out with your hands up
What somebody said
I’m thinking I was hit so I was nervous and escaped
What was I to do
Take a chance at what
Slam me and hit me
Put me in handcuffs
What I’m going to jail for
Homie I don’t know
Hit 201 murder on 5 0
Folks didn’t charge me for
Something I didn’t do
There was three of us
There was at least uh two
Now stop panic
Ain’t nothing I could do
But give it to God
Let him do what he do
Sit back have patience don’t worry
It’ll soon be over another story

[Chorus:]
52 bullets they shot
I thought about my mom
52 bullets they shot
I thought about my son
52 bullets they shot
My life flashing
52 bullets they shot
The Lord saved me
52 bullets they shot
I thought about my mom
52 bullets they shot
I thought about my son
52 bullets they shot
My life flashing
52 bullets they shot
The Lord saved me

[Verse 2:]
I know them cocksuckers wanted me dead
That’s why they invaded my house
Raid cocked to spray it
Their intentions was to fill my body up with lead
I just dropped to the floor
On my knees I prayed
To the Lord
Please don’t let me go this way
Not like this
Please Lord not this day
The shots missed me
Angel is what I say
I got a blessing
Please dawg believe me
Please be the people that didn't charge me
Now they trying to railroad
Blocked out my contacts
Money on froze
Now tell me that ain’t cold
But it’s gravy though
They gonna wish they never done it to me
Cuz when the truth come out
They’re gonna have their heads down
The truth ain’t nothing but the truth
Walk with a frown
I’m gonna be bigger than big
Thanks for your help
Me being a star again is bad for their health

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
52 bullets they blasted
Tried to leave me in the casket
But it didn’t happen
Trying to take me from my moms girlfriend and my Papi
Little brothers and auntie my uncles and little [?]
They took it
Thinking they gonna break my back
I know they wishing
Can’t let it go down like that
I bet I whooped them yeah I must
N*gga nothing but string
The sun gonna shine my n*gga I got this
