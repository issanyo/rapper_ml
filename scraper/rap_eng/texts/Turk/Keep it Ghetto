[Turk]
This that ghetto shit
This that ghetto shit
This that ghetto shit
This that ghetto shit
Ghetto ghetto (C'mon you understand, look you understand, look you understand)
Ghetto ghetto (C'mon you understand, look you understand, look you understand)
Ghetto ghetto (C'mon you understand, look you understand, look you understand)
Ghetto ghetto (C'mon you understand, look you understand, look you understand)

[Turk]
You can take me out the ghetto but can't take the ghetto out me
So I hope I'm not too ghetto
I can't help it if I'm Hollyhood
Gotta respect that I keep it ghetto 'cause it's all good
And I fuck with them ghetto hoes
I love them ghetto bitches who pop x and smoke dro
And I run with them ghetto niggas
Gettin' it how they live in the ghetto just bout their figures
Nigga the ghetto took me under and it swallowed me
Since fourteen the wrong niggas got at me
Nigga I walk ghetto talk ghetto act ghetto
And it's a true fact nigga cause I'm that ghetto
A young fellow guess I'm married to the streets
Born and raised a soulja M-A to the G Nolia
Uptown and that three, I'ma represent that 'till I'm six feet deep

[Chorus: Turk]
I keep it ghetto ghetto (Uh uh)
If you know me, if you know me, you know I..
I keep it ghetto ghetto (Uh uh)
If you know me, if you know me, you know I..
I keep it ghetto ghetto (Uh uh)
If you know me, if you know me, you know I..
I keep it ghetto ghetto (Uh uh)
If you know me, if you know me, you know I..

[Turk]
All I know is the ghetto
I came up hard my nigga in the wards of the ghetto
Raised by the streets taught to survive
Keep it real with your niggas ghetto niggas worldwide
And when one ride we all ride by all means
Be ready to spray things like the 18 you know what I mean
We stick together in the ghetto
Cock it back and slang metal in the ghetto
Violators get executed and knocked off
Out of line and not in place ??
We make our own laws nigga in the ghetto
Ho cope in the streets in the ghetto
Fuck the cops we don't roll like that
If you do you get smoked like that in the ghetto
Take it from me and my project ways
'Cause I'm so project with my project ways

[Chorus]

[Turk]
I'm lil' Turk and I'm ghetto to the bone grizzle
Thuggin' is in my blood my nigga
I'm dedicated yes I'm true to the ghetto
Holla back if you hear me nigga hello
I love this live, you love this life, I love this life
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't
In the ghetto, where I got my stripes at
Took a nigga life laid him flat on his back
Sold weed, sold dope, sold crack in the ghetto
?? that's where it's at in the ghetto
It be goin down supersonic in the ghetto
Second lines buck jumpin' in the ghetto
Dont be caught slippin' late at night
'Cause them niggas in the ghetto look they ain't right
In the ghetto, only the strong will survive
If you weak you weak nigga don't ask me why

[Chorus]

[Turk talking]
Uh uh, it's like that, Laboratory Records nigga
And it's like that, nigga gon' respect that LB, you understand
My nigga Kenoe! Young Turk, 2003, rehabilitated
It's like that, it's like that, it's like that
