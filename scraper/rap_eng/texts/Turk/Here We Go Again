[Intro]
Sup my nigga turf streets need this
Spit some of them real shit my nigga

[Verse 1]
You want to know where I been I been hustling
Running like the one doe making my ends come in
How you think I’m going to pay these bills if I don’t grind
You need to quit it stop sweating me all the time cause I
Ain’t lying you getting on my last nerves blowing my horns
Up inside that shit as I serve baby I can’t serve because
You said you think he bugging me thinking about a bitch
I gotta sucking and fucking me come on you need to
Compromise with me give me credit for the time I be with
You look at the bigger picture other bitches want to be up
In the place loving a nigga like me bringing cake home
Every day baby you very luck you au to be grateful you
Don’t have a broke nigga your nigga have paper don’t
Worry I ain’t pulling off no paper I’m just trying to have
Money like Bill Gates does

[Hook]

And every where I been you know I get my ends they know
Packing up my bags and heading to you moms again
Here we go again
And every where I been you know I get my ends they know
Packing up my bags and heading to you moms again

[Verse 2]
With that don’t stop can’t stop don’t stop hustling
Don’t make coincident don’t make nothing
You need to understand my job stop trippin on
A nigga when we coming inside telling me that you need
More quality time baby I got to eat so respect my time If
Getting money is wrong I don’t want to be right cause as
Long as my paper long I will be alright baby you got issues
You need to straighten them out cause a nigga like me
Sick and tired of hearing your mouth talking about you
Go putting me out and you going to leave me and head
To your mama’s house don’t hate on cause you going to
Be right back I understand that sometimes it’s going to
Be like that trying to get my stash keeps my pockets fat
And the only thing that gon stop me is that

[Hook]

And every where I been you know I get my ends they know
Packing up my bags and heading to you moms again
