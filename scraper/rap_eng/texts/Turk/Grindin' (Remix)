[Intro]
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’
Grindin’, grindin’

[Verse 1: Turk]
Ever since I came home from the pen
Been grindin' on my own and shit
Eight thou', seven-hundred sixty hour
YT puttin' all this shit
Real nigga, again the street fuckin' with me
Fuck a bitch nigga, got them red killers with me
Uptown nigga, let it bust
'Til it's if ya gettin' money is a must
But I'll stick it if you tempt me, so nigga don't tempt me
God don't do shit neither
Chopper worth of trouble, it's gone faster than a cheetah
Savor to the thuggin', I g'd up
Get it from the mud
I'm a thug, posted up like a meter
Stay strapped with the heater
I fuck pussy - pussy nigga, I don't need you
I'm grindin', me and my people
Puttin' in work like Amiga (Like amigos nigga)
Like Jeezy, I done seen it all
The feds askin', nigga I ain't seen nothin' at all
Swear I been nigga outside, ten time a hundred, nigga, one thou'

Grindin' for all my shit
Tryin' to build a house with one brick
Tryin' to fuck you, your bitch, and your clique
And no nigga, I ain't gave me shit


[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
The feds be spying on all of us nigga
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas
Yo' bitch fucking anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga
Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners?
That’s me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird
Is like a medicine ball to that bitch
We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know what's stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven
Ain’t got time to bond with no bitch
Heard Jay Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?
The weed sticky, grind that shit
Where I got it from? Nevermind that shit


[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
I got a new vision for all my shit
I don’t know what to call that shit
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit
I’m a different breed with this shit
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And they’ll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing
(Grindin’, grindin’)
(grindin’, grindin’)
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Than peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I’m grindin’

[Outro]
Twap, twap!
Twap, twap!
In the new house, we got the twap
