Nigga this that gangsta shit
If you a gangsta you gon feel this,you understand
This for my niggas who be totin that motherfuckin metal
You understand, in any kind of weather, ya heard me

[Turk]
Nigga my trigga finger itchy, dont get it twisted
Cause if you do nigga I'm gon start splittin
Please beleive me, beleive me please
Give that ass a dome shining
Blucka blucka to your fuckin knees
Six feet deep is where you gon sleep
Fuckin with me you get slugs fuckin with me
Get in in blood nigga fuckin with me
Original hot boy nigga real as can be
I talk that talk,but I could walk that walk
If I say I mean it nigga I don't just bark
I cock and spark,betta look out for them sharks
I dont give a fuck nigga if its daylight or dark
I have no heart, My shit freezing cold
No love for no nigga, thats how it goes
So nigga take it how you wanna bring it how you feel
Slip and make the wrong then I bet you get killed

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
When I cock, aim, shoot you betta run duck and hide
Cause it's all on you, cause when my bullets cut loose
Got one wit your name nigga Oh yes its true

[Turk]
When beef start thats when eliminating is a must
Time to saddle up grab them 4 pounds and bust
My nigga biggie riding with me
We gon throw down and bust
Fifty shots out the choppa, when we thrown down and bust
Taking no prisoners, when we thrown down and bust
Shoot em' up and bang bang, when we throw down and bust
Gotta problem I'ma assault me a nigga, I dont give a fuck
Spin the corner in a Taurus nigga,your ass out of luck
You're stuck just like two dogs my nigga
Ain't gon be a pretty site at all my nigga (at all my nigga)
Look, you die fast not slow
The last thing you see is flames and gun smoke
Gotta go and won't come back no more
Like jack you won't come back no more
Thats law, look nigga feel me though
Cause I ain't gon stop til you kill me yo

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
When I cock, aim, shoot you betta run duck and hide
Cause it's all on you, cause when my bullets cut loose
Got one wit your name nigga Oh yes its true

[Turk]
Look, I'm telling you
Nigga I'm gon speak one time
One time only after that no more
And bullets start stormin I'm wettin you up
Talk shit then I'm shuttin you up
Motherfucker, thankin your teflon
And you got nine lives
Better think again for you get shot nine times
Cross the gun line you dont wanna do that
You dont wanna go to war you ain't ready for that
It gets deep you thinkin you could swim, my nigga
In the water with the sharks I dont think so
Put your chest spray your back though
It ain't a game, take heat apon a sayin
Its a true fact though, some people call me whacko
Cause I whack niggas
Dressed in all black with the chrome mac nigga
I'ma project nigga from the dirty south
Where the murder rate high and them thugs be out

[Chorus]
