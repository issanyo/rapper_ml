[Chorus: Aura Griffiths] X2

I just wanna be, I wanna be me
Arms spread wide so I can fly and be free
Head in the clouds just as high as could be
See all I really want is to be

[Verse 1: T.U.R.K]

They’ll be quick to tell you that you’ll never make it
But when you finally do they’ll act like they never hated
One minute they love it, the next minute they hate it
If you’re not true to yourself you’ll find yourself constantly changing
I’m from a place where there’s no role models
Only a few can say they’ve paved ways, made roads to follow
And I know it might be a hard pill to swallow
But you gotta keep in mind that you’re living on time that’s borrowed
Make the most of today and hope for a better tomorrow
Don’t let what’s in the past bring you sorrow
Life is beautiful like a vivid lyric that’s written in a rap
Your life ain’t come with a receipt, so why would you give it back?
But I’m guessing if you’re hurting you’re hoping the pain lessens
My generation is facing a great depression
It’s getting harder and harder to get out of bed
Sick of the world, no prescription, but marijuana my meds

[Chorus: Aura Griffiths] X2

[Verse 2: T.U.R.K]

I’m just tryna get my cake up
Then cuff a chick that looks fine without the make up
Haven’t had the best of luck so love I stopped chasing it
Made a lot of mistakes, but in life there’s no erasing it
This one girl had me thinking that imma marry her
Now she labels me a ba’-du’ like I’m Erykah
And though my skin tone Bernie Mac black
I bet I could bag a bad bitch and her ass fat, facts
Dangerous as if a nigga wearing all red
Faces on the paper in my pockets and they’re all dead
As I look down to see the check on my sneaks
I think I need cheques for these raps that I’m rapping on beats
This would be the soundtrack to my life if I ever wrote one
Watch as I two-step to the beat of my own drum
I wanna be a better me, constantly changing everyday
Good ain’t good enough, see, I’ll be good with being great

[Chorus: Aura Griffiths] X2

[Bridge: Aura Griffiths] X2

I just wanna be
I wanna be free
Don’t wanna be you
Just wanna be me
(Ah yeah)
