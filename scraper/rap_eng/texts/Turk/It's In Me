[Verse 1]
When I start to spray, clear the way, or get shot
Cause once my gun cock, I then aim and pop
I'm a donkey nigga, look here, a untamed gorilla
Wilder than real-a, T.C. representer
Known for spinnin Benz, spendin about fifty
Plus I'm quick to ride, and give it to you bitches
I'm a no doubt nigga, always have I always will
Uptown nigga, young and thuggin, ready to kill
In my blood in my veins it be the way that I be
All I know is killin, murder drama no peace
A lil nigga nineteen got off the porch early
I done did it all believe dat, ya heard me
Nigga who like testin ya nuts, don't you do it
I don't hesitate especially if you blew it
Your set I run - through it, like a mad man
Don't think I won't do it, leave your momma sad man

[Hook x2]
It's in me my nigga to be the thug that I be
It's in me my nigga to wear baguettes on Roley
It's in me my nigga to wear - T's, 'Baud's, and Ree's
It's in me my nigga, it's in me my nigga

[Verse 2]
It's in my bloodstream wodie, to be the nigga that I am
Sold gats split hash take a boy from his fam
Nothing but streets, shit - it's all a nigga know
Knockin you off yo' feet, quick - that's all a nigga know
Drive-bys and pull-ups I'm prepared any day
Thugging as usual I do dat every day
Bitch-niggas get roasted, if you're not from round my way
In the middle of the quarter in one of them hallways
Quick to spill ya blood, I'm real I ain't fake
Leave ya ass a murder scene in the middle of yellow tape
Put a hole in your thinking cap, you won't be thinking no more
Nigga you'll be put to nap
A young nigga play it raw raw, and "X" ya bitch-ass out
Me and my nigga Rat quick to run up in yo' house
Fuck it, I goes out cause it's in me my nigga
When it's a coke drought I tote a semi my nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm the one they're talkin about, original Hot Boy
Lil' Turk nigga, run up and get shot boy
With a long gun, a K with rounds in it
A nigga, shot at you're dome, when I'm spinning and bending
Non-stop cousin, the chopper a fool yea
Get ya nigga mind right, that's what it do yea
Blood and brains, all over the streets
Is what you see nigga, when ya fucking with me
I'll do you something awful split ya shit real deep
Closed casket you had front you for your peeps
I get up in black, somebody dying tonight
Look, load up the mac, it's time to ride tonight
I'm disguise like a woman mask over my face
Gloves on my hand no evidence for the case
That's how I got it done, look, did it smart and smooth
If you don't want rouble look, nigga better be cool

[Hook x4]
