[Verse 1: Christian Radke]
She wanna get beside me
She wanna make me leave everything behind me
I come to mind slipping on that bomb, babe
But I ain't tripping, always on Monday, always on Monday
We get up on Tuesday, get on my knee acting blood for today
Get some food in here, there'll still be, grinding all day
She text me saying she racing back at my place
Racing back at my place she got on her front face
Sure she been drinking and she popped a couple mollies
Girl, Irma work it, let me hit it by the fireplace
Girl I'm a freak you, I can hit it like in fire ways
Hitting it for five days
Now it's like it finally got me, she lying down, that signal finally got me
I didn't want to but I couldn't stop my body
I see you looking on here, just tryina copy, he just tryina copy me

[Hook]
Y'all just hating on the team cause you know we roll
Caught her like Korea, bitch is tryina in vain
Fuck up the team, riding steady, getting closer to the dream
Cause you know we riding, sipping drinks stuffing pills in our wallets
Meet me at the club, you know that I'm just popping
What you want, baby girl, I fucking got it

[Verse 2: Turk]
There was a cold day in November
And I'll pray I'll remember
When I first laid my eyes on her I knew I had to get her
I know I wanted to hit her but I took it slow, fool
I took her out to dinner, red lobster for show
This one here is for show, certified made woman
Had her own house and car and she had her own money
Ain't that something? She ain't needed nothing
But I found out her nigga was locked up, so she needed loving
So I had to give it to her, she gave it to me back
One word 'bout no other broad she ain't never asked
So I kept it like that at least for a while
But I had to keep it real and tell her I had a child
I told her I had a son down in the NO
Baby mamma was tripping, the reason I let go
Her face hit the floor, and she was like oh
I gotta think about this so I walked out the door

[Hook]
Y'all just hating on the team cause you know we roll
Caught her like Korea, bitch is tryina in vain
Fuck up the team, riding steady, getting closer to the dream
Cause you know we riding, sipping drinks stuffing pills in our wallets
Meet me at the club, you know that I'm just popping
What you want, baby girl, I fucking got it
We getting closer to the dream
