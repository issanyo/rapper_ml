[Hook:]
We in the fast life, ya gotta think fast
Cause it'll pass by ya, right in a blink, flash
I'm talkin' fast life, you in the full trance
You gotta have some swag 'bout ya
There go them goons, man
We in the fast life, ya gotta think fast
Cause it'll pass by ya, right in a blink, flash
I'm talkin' fast life, you in the full trance
You gotta have some swag 'bout ya
There go them goons, man
We in the fast life...
Fast life...

[Verse 1:]
Decent nigga, I know the craft
I used to run that dope on Magnolia Ave
Got purpose, nigga, let's move the half
Got dope too, nigga, wanna score a bag?
Your shit can't even take a one
Niggas told me they can't even make a G
Now I can see why you hatin', son
I'm fuckin' these hoes, I'm reppin' these streets
And I just came from across the coast
And I wrote a check and bought a boat
And I came back with the rawest dope
And I hit the checks and open up the shop
Kept it real and said fuck the scams
Hit it with a two and sold nothin' but grams
And you can't buy nothin' from me
You gotta see my people, go talk to fam'
Real blood that flows through the hearts of men
If there's beef, you'll get no argument
It's a nigga found dead in a car again
From doin' way too much talkin'
And you know, bark and break offense
I tell niggas 'bout that shit often
Well, niggas think they Superman
You know Lois Lane need Clark Kent

[Hook 2:]
We in the fast life, ya gotta think fast
Cause it'll pass by ya, right in a blink, flash
I'm talkin' fast life, you in the full trance
You gotta have some swag 'bout ya
There go them goons, man
We in the fast life...
Fast life...

[Verse 2:]
I'm a thug-ass nigga, addicted to fast livin'
Gettin' money is a must, how it is in my city
I get it crackin', I make it happen, pimpin'
Stay on the trap 24/7, don't be bullshittin'
All day, all night, in the same old club
So much paper can't fold no more
Nonstop, it can be hot or cold
I'm a hustler, nigga, gotta play my role
A trap star â€“ I got a lawyer retained in case I fall short
Cause they ahead of the game, I gotta think smart
