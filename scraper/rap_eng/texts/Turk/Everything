Clean as a whistle, fresh as a baby, we in the air
Spending paper like crazy, I don't fuckin care

I'm selling you dreams, baby I'm sincere
Balling like a team, cavalier

Let's pick meditate, our world premiere
In other word, getting my last name, my dear
Do it better than your last man, I'm a keep it real
