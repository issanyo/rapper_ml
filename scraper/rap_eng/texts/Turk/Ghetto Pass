Hardest niggas we the New Orleans niggas live for the gun play
And please don’t let that nigga have no chat on your head
In less than 24 hour you ass dead once that nigga got that
First stack of body and make your way with a nigga you think
It’s your daddy I know niggas been hating on me so I eat with it

Beast with it I came from uptown but I’m a living legend I will
Be all out of bounds nigga know and come behind me believe
