[Hook: Turk]
Niggas thought I wouldn’t make it to see this year
Niggas thought I wouldn’t make it to see last year
But I’m still here, but I’m still here
But I’m still here, but I’m still here
Niggas thought I wouldn’t make it to see last year
Niggas thought I wouldn’t make it to see this year
But I’m still here, but I’m still here
But I’m still here, but I’m still here

[Verse 1: Turk]
Nigga, I’m still here, nigga I’m stick tickin’
Nigga, I’m still thuggin’, nigga I’m still gettin’ it
Nigga, I’m still wildin’, nigga I’m still raw
Me I’m the same G, yeah, a fuckin’ outlaw
Niggas still hatin’, niggas still plottin’
But I’m already watchin’ and already cocked it
I know why I’m still here, ‘cause I’m a made man
Y’all think one move at a time, I think a few ahead
Few of the clique didn’t make it, a few got murdered
A few of them got caught up and the jury served ‘em
I’m still here, keepin’ it real with you
In the race to be a multimillionaire nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.G.]
Nigga I’m still here, bitch I’m still thuggin’
I did a decade, and I ain’t say nothin’
I lost my little brother, wish he was still here
2010, ‘bout to be 3 years
I kicked my dope habit, that gorilla had me
Them one and ones somethin’ serious, no smilin’ or laughin’
Niggas counted me out, thought I wouldn’t bounce back
YNT, we ‘bout to eat, I’m talkin’ rack attacks
Try to take my stacks, them gunners they go rat-tat-tat
I tell that gangster, yeah, them colors they go rat-tat-tat
They tell ya touchdown, Jizzle, I’mma represent
Chopper City, young and thuggin’, the streets and the pen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Turk]
Nigga I’m still here, still standin’ strong
Still doin’ me, still holdin’ on
Still runnin’ more, still duckin’ laws
If you ain’t down with Choppers City, nigga, fuck y’all
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, nigga, this my home
Come to New Orleans you see Jizzle sittin’ on the throne
I’m ridin’ with the chrome, I’m ridin’ with the heat
I’m in my habitat, we guerillas, that’s like me

[Hook]
