[Verse 1]
Many days and nights I had to tussle with the grown monks
Appetite expensive you only eat more me and my habit went
Blow for blow toe to toe had to pull a Keyshia Cole let it go try
To kick it but it end up kicking me hoping it leave in a bathroom
Cuffing my sleeves my mornings praying that shit hoping for
Change when thermus in summer trying to hide my things
Me my tracks before a show I’m doing a pack trying to go but
That hoe keep calling me back that James Brown got me feelin
Like an Austranorth loaded a 27 like a traveling car they planting
The pot came through raided my spot victims you shot probation
Back on my block no longer struggling that habit I put it behind
J Price believed in me so I knew I had to shine

[Hook]
It’s been a struggle but I made it do you hate it tribulation
I’m shaking I’m aching it’s been a long troubled way but I
Made it It’s been a struggle but I made we made it tribulation

[Verse 2]
Been neglected overlooked my so called niggas they gave up
How could you forget about a nigga you growed up with since
94 nigga you grown up now you nigga got problems you work
With them don’t don’t let them go screaming out love soon or
Later and you see the facts that you put on the end I’m wondering
Where love at nowadays a woman keep it more 100 than niggas
Do you might make woman stay hundred and got me through
How could I now been on a vacation and been through a lot of
Shit that had my mind aching 22 years I was facing but the lord
Erased it got me back on the street knowing a lot of niggas goin
To be hating this it’s been a while homie but I made it It has been
A long time struggling but I made it don’t be a legend like Pac and
Biggie had the world's eyes wide and be happy I did it
