[Intro - Turk - talking] (*echo*)
Uh huh
Young Turk nigga
Don't know
Uh huh
It's like that nigga (c'mon)
Uh huh
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon (uh huh)
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Look, look, look

[Verse 1 - Turk]
I thought you was my number one bitch, but I was wrong
I was trippin, I had to be stone for pones
I'm out my mind thinkin you gon' just my time
But when I, when I went up that road you gon' stop the cryin
I heard that I caught five, but I gave it back
When I touch down bitch, I'm gon' pay you back
I'ma fuck all you friends, all you close of kin
Go back to bein a straight pitch again
Put that steering wheel in your back, ride you bitch
And I could give a fuck if your cryin bitch
I'ma give you somethin dirty, I'ma have the last laugh
I put that on my life, I'ma have the last laugh
Try to blues me but the tables turned
And it stopped on me, bitch you gon' learn
Played with a Hot Boy, you gon' burn baby burn
Head don't smoke like we just hit shern

[Chorus - Turk] - 4X
Bitch you gon' have that dick look
Gon' have that dick look
Gon' have that dick look
Gon' have that dick look

[Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Now this little dame, must of misplaced her brain
Switchin up without the slightest little trace of shame
Since Bubba K became, a heavily stated name
She's thinkin my dang-a-lang, is a ride on the gravy train
I certaintly ain't a lame, little Betty you misguided
Cause it's rubels, not noodles that gets me excited
Ain't never seen shit like it, a fisher done been dykin
Since Clinton was the pres, now 'tendin she meant like it
Now slut, you got somethin to tell me "oh wow, what?"
You always loved Andy, cooled olie and mowwed up
I'll oblige and give you a ride, but the only prize
You receivin is what I'm squeezin out on your chalky thighs
Oh these five dudes standin behind me, don't mind them
But if it's fuckin we discussin, just know they gon' chime in
But that shouldn't be an issue, you love me don't get shook
Stupid whore that's what you get for givin that dick look (uh oh!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Turk]
Bitch I'm home now and I'm back on my feet
Back to the same Turk that I used to be
You can get off my dick bitch, stop sweatin my balls
Cause it wasn't all that when I was behind the wall
Bitch now you want me behind ya, I don't want have none
You did a dirty deed, bitch you played me sour
You left me stranded like "Gilligan"
To be honest with you bitch you was killin me
But I'ma dog like "Blue's Clues"
You did that bitch, well watch how I do you
I'ma put you on cruise control
Full speed bitch, you stanky ho
It's a must that you feel my pain and hurt bitch
Cause the name of my game is Eagle first bitch
I'ma fool, you started and I'm gon' finish it
Two can play at that game, but watch who win it bitch (bitch)

[Chorus]

[Outro - Turk - talking]
Look I don't know what's wrong with these hoes man
Niggas gon' get in their jokes and these hoes go south
Like Casper, you know what I'm sayin?
It's all gravy though
These stupid ass hoes, just don't know
Bitch talkin 'bout, she can't pay her bills
Know what I'm sayin?
And why she only fucked one but nigga
It's all gravy bitch, don't have to send me no letters
You heard me, I'ma Hot Boy
