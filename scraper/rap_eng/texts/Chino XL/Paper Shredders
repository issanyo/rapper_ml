[INTRO: CRAW, SHIZZY]
Yeah, Character Assassins
Come fuck with us, Craw, Shizzy

[VERSE 1: CRAW]
You don’t really get it do you?
I ain't here to sit and doodle, write down some bullshit and call it a rap
I’m that paper shredder shredding paper
Sweat her get her wetter than Niagara, Viagra couldn’t make me harder son
Kamikaze out of Visine on an IV drip of Saline
Sailing over the Atlantic, directly over Atlantis
Can’t you see I’m going bananas on Ape Shit
Like Marilyn with a face lift, fucking anything with a base hit
It’s basic, my makeshift scenario is my word
Word, bumping out your stereo
There we go, pretty plain, staring at the sky
Gritty game, pretty dame, all I really need in life
So everybody gather round watch as I just run it down
100 pounds of wonder-fal, 75 of fight left
Won’t flop ‘till the heart stops in my chest
Ahh

[Chorus X2: CRAW, SHIZZY]
We them paper shredders them seventh letters that do it better
Thinking that you better put up your cheddar we sever letters

[VERSE 2: CHINO XL]
Let’s go in
Meticulous written, ridiculous articulate
Religiousness from the hands of the infamous indigenous
Violent farinas journalist with a burning wrist
Creating world from words where previously they did not exist
Monster with a manuscript we all know who the villain is
Chino the lyric lunatic being chase by villages
My verse a curious curse, murder mysterious
Should change my name to Mr. Are You Fucking Serious
Beast with his leash gone, sicker than seeing the pope on the Vatican throne
Having mass with Dre Beats on
You coward’s bones are the grass that I graze on
Call yourself a spitter you’d be better at selling Avon
Gas and napalm, fatalist liaison
Fine female literature nerds consider my art form device and part porn
Cutters would splice to the right forearm if this icon would sacrifice the night to um
Abuse must of startled, startling the arguing
You’ll be spilling copious amounts of blood out of your arteries
That ain't photography, god my life is valuable
You will not prevail over me, god will not allow you to
XL an angel that fell, paper shredder to fracture
Crush to confetti to throw you a ticker tape parade in hell
Just pack leader and thread
Odd makers in Vegas are at a loss for words, Chino is the alphabet

[Chorus X2: CRAW, SHIZZY]
We them paper shredders them seventh letters that do it better
Thinking that you better put up your cheddar we sever letters

[VERSE 3: SHIZZY]
Now we living better now Gucci sweater now
We them seventh letters with them paper shredders heavy how
The pen hits the notepad, it’s all good then goes bad
You know Shizz you know that, square biz but blow caps
Put your sweet face against my black heart baby
Stay blazing diesel like 80’s Mercedes
Save me please I can’t keep these ladies off me
Till I finish with a bang, Cobain biography
Black tar heroin, that’s blacker than Akon
My ATM card ain't the only thing that’s withdrawn
That’s the type of shit I’m on, see the snakes and cut the lawn
You could kill a donkey with just half the stash that I am on
Warm summer nights smell the lust in the wind
Getting bent till I bend three sheets to the wind
Swimming in seven sins I’ve been fighting all my life
Serenade with a severed blade, dump you in the Everglades

[Chorus X2: CRAW, SHIZZY]
We them paper shredders them seventh letters that do it better
Thinking that you better put up your cheddar we sever letters
