We do our thang nigga
We make it bang nigga

We keeps our swagger tight

[Big Havikk]
Thats how I [?], boy
Cause we about to bang boy
Westcoast on the grind
All day, from LA to the Bay
Imma tell ya we dont play
So watcha gotta say, boy
Sure 'nuff we rolls deep
Low-lows with the hot beat
Weak thugs wanna test me
SC no joke, cartel, what it do
So nigga what you gotta ask me?
Look here, boy
We ride or die
Westside gonna ride or die
.44s on our hips that trip
Imma load that clip and let 44 slugs fly
G'd up in the [?], loco
Have em on the floor shit
Thats what you didn't know bitch
My game your game dont match
BG, take a walk
Im about to fuckin' blow, bitch
Got the Henn in a cup, pimpin'
Im sacked on that Cali Kush
Stupid fools walkin' close to the edge
Talkin' shit about me
Get they motherfuckin' ass pushed (ahhh)
Hot steel is the recipe
Yo Gramm, why they testin' me?
Im hot, thats real
On point, like a [?] growing up on [?]
Big Hav gon' keep it real
Come on now

We do our thang nigga

[Gramm Kracker]
Lift me up, pull me down
I've been to Heaven, been to Hell
Well I'm back now cousin, doing my thing
The only thing you can see are the diamonds in my rings
You wanna shine like me, you better hit the block
You wanna be a G, you gotta pack your Glock
And dont freeze up dawg, when it comes down to it
When its life or death, you know you have to do it
Is it worth the drama?
Is it worth the pain?
From the Dot to LA, we can change the game
And I can make it rain if I have to
My new crib is big as a castle
So dont hassle me cause Im loco
Runnin' down the my block while bustin on the .44
Here I go and a rollin with Hav
And the SCC, ride with me
Slide with me
For the West, for the East
Homie, Im a beast
On the microphone, I can hold my own
But Im better when I hold the chrome
Let me cock it back while I spit some flame
For goodness sack, stop droppin' names
Thats all she wrote when I cut your throat
[?] in he mirror while Im rollin' Kush smoke




[HOOK] X4
We do our thang nigga
We make it bang nigga

[Chino XL]

(Yo. Chino, hurt em!)

Spit vicious
Make a nigga wanna sleep with the fishes  (yeah!)
Livin' life in the trenches
Its my pleasure to show you how beautiful death is
Aggressive is what you find offensive (ok)
Inventive, how you lie about adventures
Try to ride against us
Kinda like the sense is stormin' like a tempest
Art form on a canvas
Swarmin' like evil spirits
Get beat senseless by my metal wrenches
Need a dentist; stitches 30 inches
Bitches, interest in a nigga's sex game, grant me wishes
How i bring em pain (shhh)
With me, business, stackin' money man
Spit propane or I flame insane
Syllable murderer, that'll never change
Hit a vain like Kurt Colbain's heroine
Burrowin' all up inside of your mind
Ahead of my time
Design lines that exterminated mankind
Layin' inside a box you will never see sunshine (Nah!)
Jaime Fox playin' Ray Charles, your blind
To the fact that Im never past my prime
The bastard from Jerusalem
With [?], acid tongue, elastic lungs
Blastin' guns, with Gramm Kracker and [?]
