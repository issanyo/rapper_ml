[Intro]
What'chu talkin 'bout yo?
The fuck you mean yo?
I'm an MC, I rock all type of shit yo
I started rockin in parties in, in 8th grade nigga
Watch how I do this shit

[Chino XL]
Aight, verse one, fuckin with me
Is fuckin with the worst one, I spit it with speed
With skill of a surgeon, if you buyin that weed
And carrying guns or missin Big Pun let me hear y'all niggas
It's curtains if you try to impede
On gettin this work done, you better believe
The murderous version, Puerto Rican gangstas
Crips, Bloods, pimps, thugs in this club let me hear y'all niggas
Deferred funds, money and royalties
Killin my burdens, my MC loyalties
Spittin from my lungs, if you sittin in yo' whip
Hollerin at a bitch, blastin my shit let me hear y'all niggas
I burst 'em, you thinkin I wouldn't squeeze
He in a hearse numb, pain and penalties
Jers', Jerusalem, Christian, Muslim
Everybody make it jump, get it crunk when it come, yo

[Chorus: Chino XL]
I don't give a fuck about nothin
I just wanna smoke, fuck, drink, and verbal murder somethin (okay)
I'm the papi the mamis all lovin
When I smoke, fuck, drink, and verbal murder somethin
I don't give a fuck about nothin (uh-uh)
I just wan' smoke, fuck, drink, and verbal murder somethin (okay)
I'm the papi that the mamis all lovin
When I smoke, fuck, drink, and verbal murder somethin

[Chino XL]
Honestly it's a little too live tonight
Like somebody gonna get shot tonight
Beastin, me and my niggas when our money ain't right
We still got enough game to pull a bitch that's tight
Have Chinese or Japanese mamis on they knees
Gasped, I told 'em my twin sister was Alicia Keys (hahaha)
But I ain't lovin her - I got a lot of muscles
That gotta count for somethin, Schwarzenegger is a governor
But I ain't carjackin no Hummer to impress
Ladies call me Champagne, I keep they pussies Moet/mo' wet
This that Puerto Rican gangsta shit
I'm half-black, got a big ass dick
Checkin mami with the thick ass lips
She ain't impressed with these lyrical skills
I make movies and got record deals to pay those bills
Take those pills for real, she borin when she sober (yup)
These bitches is Jewish how much they gettin +Passed Over+

[Chorus]
[Chino XL]
Yo... check it
Dawg, don't even comment, I'm hotter than a comet
These snitch niggas don't turn states, they turn continents
I tell nothin with confidence, my intolerance legendary
Hostile in monetary in punchlines I've said already
Threw 'em in the garbage next to Oscar the Grouch
8 million dollar house sellin lines by the ounce
Identify yo' wifey by the size of her mouth
Stretch marks to accommodate my massive amounts
Without doubts I'm too violent (uh-huh)
Never retirin, pushin a Jag, playing "Vice City" on my palm pilot
I'm not a kind man, I run with con men
Strong, throwing +Signs+ like M. Night Shyamalan
Go 'head and bring the drama on (uh-huh)
I'll whip that ass, take pictures of it on my Sprint picture-takin cell phone
Your little wifey's at home, thinkin I'm God
I'm leavin your ride full of more holes than Spongebob (blaow!)

[Chorus]
