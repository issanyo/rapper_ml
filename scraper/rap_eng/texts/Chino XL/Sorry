[Intro: {"sample"} Chino XL & Shaunta]
{"Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms?"}
{"Ohh, I forgot to be your lover}"
We going through it
{"Ohh, I forgot to be your lover}"
You said you loved me, I did
{"Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms?"}
{"Sorry"} I'm sorry, my bad
{"Sorry"} For sure
{"Sorry"} Shaunta with Chino XL
{"Sorry"} Yeah, come on

[Verse 1: Shaunta]
We used to make love, now we hate each other guts
No more words between us, you in the streets, I'm in the cut
I figure, give me space, give you some time
And when you put me out on the highway, I paid it no mind
Caught a taxi to my crib, rubbed up my six
Full throttle to your crib, crying and shit
Should have listened 'cause we was like night and day
Should have seen it, you'd break my heart anyway
But I lost my mind, you hit my spot when you made love to me
Was you loving me or fucking me when you was inside of me?
In deep brown eyes lies a man that's so unsure
Insecure, learning from a girl that's yours
When the streets beat you up and you can't take no more
And that lifestyle you leading leads you to back to my door
Tell me, I'll play your flute forever {"Did I reach out and hold you}"
As long as you and I can stay together forever
{"in my loving arms?"}

[Hook: {"sample"} Chino XL & Shaunta]
{"Ohh, I forgot to be your lover"} We gon' do it
We gon' do it, I'm sorry baby
{"Ohh, I forgot to be your lover"}
Yeah {"Ohh, I forgot to be your lover"}
We gon' do it, I'm sorry baby, yeah uhuh
{"Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms?"}
Never that yo, yo

[Verse 2: {"sample"} Chino XL]
{"Sorry"} That I wasn't always true to you
{"Sorry"} But you knew what you was getting into
{"Sorry"} I'm surrounded by many women that's beautiful
{"Sorry"} Damn baby, I'm only human, what I'm 'posed to do?
Hey boo, ex-wifey now it's crucial
You on TV with Brandy saying I don't know you like I used to
You choose to be complaining and it just don't pass well
When chicks be throwing their panties on stage for me like Maxwell
Yeah my head swell to an extent and it's hard for it not to
But I strapped up crazily and you know who I'm coming home to
When [?] was giving problems
Tryna trick me into marriage like Carmen Electra did to Dennis Rodman
You violated, lied and tried to creep with some dudes
When I provided you with Benz, Jeeps, beepers and jewels
She confused, it's my apartment
I cheated on you more than Dirty got police warrants, just being honest

[Hook: {"sample"} Chino XL]
{"Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms?"}
{"Ohh, I forgot to be your lover"} We gon' do it
I'm sorry baby {"Ohh, I forgot to be your lover"}
We gon' do it {"Ohh, I forgot to be your lover"}
I'm sorry baby
{"Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms?"}

[Verse 3: {"sample"} Chino XL & Shaunta]
{"Sorry"} I let your man palm my ass, What?
{"Sorry"} All the shit you bought I pawned for glass
{"Sorry"} I turned your little sexy ass out
{"Sorry"} You got the keys to my apartment and house
Had chicks chasing you down just to see where we live
I was the baddest bitch in Cali, having your kids
And you didn't even love me, you just liked fucking my ribs
Took the keys off the dresser, left you stuck at the crib
And I don't even swallow cum, I gives a fuck who you is
Now your ass feel used with my sent on your dick, come on
{"Sorry"} Momma said you only wanted my wealth
Still I ended up loving you more than I love myself
Five years, prom pictures taken down off the shelf
Ate your pussy imaging you was somebody else
In the Court House, I'm wilding out, you my housekeeper
We split up and the judge let you keep the house
{"Sorry"} We not even legal, I'm tripping
The only ring you was getting was around the bathtub after you finish stripping
Apologies? Save 'em all for your priests
And the stepdaughter you helped me raise is also your niece (That's your sister?)

[Hook: {"sample"} Chino XL]
{"Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms?"}
{"Sorry"} I have to chill in your home
{"Sorry"} Keep my baby's mom
{"Sorry"} Your pussy was the bomb
{"Sorry"} I had to beat your tongue
{"Sorry"}
