[Verse 1]
I'm high feeling like I'm walking in clouds
And seeing faces staring at me as I move through the crowd
Feeling like the whole world just took a wickedness vow
Ridiculous how hate has replaced all religiousness now
Stop off in front of a church, I kneel and I bow
Black rosary for all the pain I kept in my file
Never reciprocated all the hurt that my mom allowed
For happened to me, the amount of tears I shed could have drowned
Now all I want to do is make my little girls proud
And pray my death is quiet but my funeral's loud
When I'm feeling inspired reaching my inner child
I witness my illusion shatter with no angels around
I'm hoping this explains why my hate and my anger's abound
Abused and threatened with death if I had dared made a sound
Knocked to the floor, silently curled up on the ground
I guess blood's a rite of passage on the way to the crown

[Hook]
Save me
I think I'm going crazy
So won't you just pray for me
I'm falling deeper than I've gone before
Maybe
I'm thinking that maybe
If somebody prays for me
I won't fall deeper than I've gone before

I think I'm losing it man

[Verse 2]
I knew she loved me but it wasn't the time
There was so much left for me to do, so far from my prime
In hindsight, I probably should have sacrificed, wouldn't mind
Bedroom apartment was leaking, I was out of my mind
I was young, ain't know who I was, how could I respond?
That abortion went against my principles, am I wrong?
Gritty like selling my spirit out just in different forms
Three months in the stomach, that fetus knew my voice when I talked
Yeah, it was her decision true, but I should have fought
And having beautiful children later enhances the thought
I should've never wavered or caved in or stayed in a [?]
I hated all things living, my descension and fall
Apologies in the song but I swear I was lost
Hope it wasn't painful when your little light was cut off
As my ex lay there bleeding, started feeling remorse
I pray their forgiveness for me as I'm hugging this cross

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I see her outside playing now and then
She's got bruises on her arms like she fell off a swing
Paid it no mind, I'm blind, guess it is what it is
Plus I was having my own drama with the mom of my kids
Ironically she became one of my daughter's friends
Such a tiny little thing, her name was Elizabeth
Her family stayed right down the hall from where we lived
Sometimes I thought I heard her screaming, man these walls are thin
Tried to sleep right after tucking my princess in
Staring at the ceiling, know I need to mind my own biz
But flashbacks of my own childhood would spin
Of my stepfather's abuse, this little girl's innocent
I seen her father one time, he's a cop and a pig
Her mom an ex-beauty queen turned heroin fiend
One day at the pool my family wanted to swim
I seen Elizabeth there with a bruise on her chin
A cut on her ribs by a mark on her chest
She cried do you even have to ask one question, who did this?
I seen the fear through her eyes and scratched retina lid
Man I was gone in the head and I just couldn't sit
I flipped
You might think that I am crazy
But I can't let them hurt this baby
I kicked in the door with no gun in my hand
You want to fight somebody mother fucker, you fight a man
I'm in prison now for what I did
Her dad can never hurt Elizabeth again cause he's dead

[Hook]
