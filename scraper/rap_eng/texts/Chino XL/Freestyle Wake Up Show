[Verse]
Now I'm aiming for luxury
Niggas got no love for me
Even into pulling gats and bust me
But you could trust me with your life
But you'd rather see me suffering
Thinking you live rougher than but I was broke when you was hustling
Playing my mental
Flossing like it's dental hygiene
Laughing at me like I'm on Comedy Central
Put you on when I met you
Sacrificed being luchified
But you was slanging rocks
While I was starving rocking over an instrumental
I've been doing this Dana Dane was having Nightmares
Of being signed to Maverick and falling off again
Ten porcelain dreams that's shattering
Blowing in the wind like pollen
The drama I'm in
Forget apologizes, jealousy flaring like allergies
I'm on women's TV's now none of y'all niggas is smiling
Dominate A male, getting punanny by mistake
How much hate mail can one pretty nigga generate?
Bring any featherweight I'll pluck 'em
Make his game crash like little Jessica's airplane
And leave his chicken's clucking
It's a damn shame, offended
I'm broker than some, I'm richer than most and also fair skinned
So all your women is fair game
The campaign ended I got skills and you can't boo me
You think your nigga riding an uptown fugee can do me?
Broke niggas when will you realize?
Real drug dealers ain't pushing size 10 and a half Filas
They pushing real whips
That rip player haters and giving real niggas dibs
And it's funny
To me, fish and chips means punnany and money
And I ain't mad at cha
But all that Armorall ain't making your Honda no Acura
I get a lot of love to be such a hated man
Came into the cipher on bullshit but you leaving as a Chino fan
That's how I know I'm God
Nobody believes in me
I'm able to make you stand inside of the handicap legally
Erik Estrada making CHiPS hand over fist to get rich
I'm going overboard like strong willed Africans off of ships
Illest lyrics ever invented
Said it and meant it
You're hearing more claps than inside of Vietnam VD clinic
Get it?
Listening intense, never get no wins
Don't make me get beside myself like identical twins
My cynical friends still quote my old rhyme
My mind is a gold mine
Oh shit, it's bugged like Martin Luther King's phone line
Quote mine
Ask phenomenon, starving like Ramadan
If lines was episodes of Star Trek these niggas couldn't cling on/Klingon
