[3rd Verse: Canibus' verse]
(In Jamaican accent)
Bobo Bell
Anika L
Both rose and both fell
(End Jamaican accent)
Seven billion created from one cell
Viva la vida in your heaven or your hell
As we fold the untold tales behind the veil
Giant crystal peelers
Coughed out of the vertebrae of the Great Lizard
The Wizard of Writtens has no limits
A simple man constipated with evil
Yet every day I keep it at bay
Surrounded by incontinent people
I create hip hop standards for linguistic mechanics
I land this I stand to position my campus then vomit language
Catatonic Canibus I'm a Tyrannosaurus
Cut my teeth on granite gnawin' the planet
Cold fire freezin' deep voice demon breathin' helium
Close encounter ingredient with no medium
Blood is a funky cologne
With the viscosity of spongey bone
A hive mind inside honeycomb
Gate box hologram
Play Keys of Solo-man
If lyrics don't matter what you rhymin for fam?
Behavior biometrics fame recognitions medics
Forget it, comedic homedics with human aesthetics
A Frankenstein false flag
Experiment gone bad
A lobster boss jerkin off with his claw hand
The pinball machine sound effect singing songs
To ward off war with [ ] and Prince Bandor
Breakdance beatbox modern day Enoch
I swear lyrics still matter it's the key to the lock
Heretic Heretic hematoma hemorrhage
Triple in velamen they lock downside the tenement
Never let him in
I'm Marval comic demonic ultrasonic blue beam bionic
Way above your pay grade -- Just bein' honest
You're motherfuckin right my lyrics still matter
It's the greatest citadel ever built by a rapper!
(Chino XL) Lyrics Still Matter
(Phoenix)  Lyrics Still Matter'
(Canibus) Lyrics still matter
The 9th Wonder of the World built by REAL rappers!


[Next song]

(Canibus' 1st verse)

They preach this, they preach that, fuck the feedback
We under the same banner called rap
Divided way out of alignment
Truth is not one-sided
But who can argue with silence
They preach this, they preach that, fuck the feedback
We under the same banner called rap

Sample: "I'm a dangerous man to know"

(Canibus' 2nd verse)
Yo, do yourself a favor
Try to rap while you shave a
Calvary saber sharp as razors
From your tent to your trachea
You just a citizen slave
Chasin' folk at Ellie Shadow through a cave
Laid in a Peruvian grave
Attack like swarms of drones
With chromed out terminator bones
That's why Logan won't leave me alone
He backtracked it to the territory of a fisher cat
Picture that
Twisted himself into a terrific trap
You only got fans on the internet
You a rap vet with IBS
And the shit ain't even hit em yet
You might as well rape your mother
It's too late for you to be rediscovered
You never know I might be your cousin
The one who had to discipline you
Because you wasn't original
True victory is not visible without peripheral
Who made all those albums, and wrote all those songs
A whole career and never put nobody on?

NEXT SONG

Pre-intro:
Robaholic: "Yo this is Robaholic"
Zinko: "Yo this is Zinko"
Robaholic: "First off we have to thank you for being willing to work with us. It is an honor to work with such a rapper like you. Our group's name is "Anchantorlu" -- in English it means Safe Landing and in Asian it's pronounced "An chan tor lu. ...Peace!"

[Intro: Canibus]
Yo this is Can I Bus rhyming from Miami to Peking Island
The original Beast of the East with the great Kool G Rap

East Coast/West Coast international worldwide
Standing in solidarity for safe landings everywhere
Let's go get 'em Zinko!

[Verse: Zinko, to be transcribed]

NEXT SONG - The Heat Is On (?)


[Canibus]
Bro Bro Bro Brooklyn might have changed
But the possee the same
We maintain, and we still the strongest link in the chain
We don't wanna clap, God
We don't wanna applaud
We want bars for the wall
Without that you a fraud
Patience still stragulation
Boom bap bass to keep the pace
Sittin in a 60 Studebaker
Betta test Buddha for paper chasin'
Our generation was the greatest
We made mistakes but you gotta face it
I was young, blind, deaf, dumb, naked
They caught me with the hardware dropped the case
I was [  ] proof anti grease the juice
Storm troops, move!

[NEXT SONG WITH MF DOOM]

[Intro: Canibus]
It's been a long time comin'
Can I Bus and MF Doom
They been waitin' for this
Yeah, chase comin' soon

[Verse: Canibus]
MF Doom My cell mate
Tombstone paint
Wait for the Adelphia Freedom Bell and jail break
Chase nah, I overtake you tailgate
How does carbon monoxide taste snail face?
Crustacians in deep water ocean plates
The great [  ] pearl Serbian noose
Iberian scourge 2 second before you dive off a curb
I was singing in a choir in church
Too fast radio burst
The Earl Grey tea gives off steam
Distorted shadows are seen
Through the stargate humanity screams
Can't distinguish between they wants they needs
Noble or immature deeds
It's no wonder why they'll never be free
Let's take a jump back through the mysteries
Designated by the [  ] semantics
Theocratic gymnastics
Turn the page to the next passage
And continue on about the Secret Society and their magic
"It was a manageable church man [ ] Serpent force"
