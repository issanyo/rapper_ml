[Intro]
(All things in their time)

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
I'll take you back fifteen years, analyze
Every verse is cleaner than a surgeon's hands when they've been sanitized
I'll take you back to the panic when rap was dangerous
Blasting EPMD out of them classic Jeep Wranglers
I'll take you back to a different time
Spazzing like River Phoenix outside of the Viper Room the night he died
Back to paying dues spitting lit a fuse
With the mathematical, aeronautical cynic mind of Howard Hughes
Abnormality, I'll take it back to originality
If I'm insane then rap is my insanity
I'll take it back like an Indian giver
Yo scratch that term, I'd rather throw a White cowboy in the river
I'll take it back, full rage
Performing How You Like Me Now with Kool Moe Dee right up on the same stage
Let's get it back to the basics
Zookeepers need to put a diaper on Chino when he goes ape shit
Hip-Hop is a great ship, let me steer it
My skill level's so high that when I rhyme only dogs hear it
The ghetto vampire that's walking in the sunlight
The lyric Christ, I turn entire blocks to mass grave sites
I will brolic Brock Lesnar your career
Chino got more Seoul than the capital of Korea
I'm bringing wind storms, rain, darkness and drear
Puncture heart valves, painting nightmares in blood smears
'98, I'd like to take it back
Still only attract women that think murder's an aphrodisiac
A lot of cats that just hopped into this artform
Are like photographers that never stepped inside a darkroom
I'll take it back to when I wanted to be Tito from the Fearless Four
The illest Puerto Rican I had ever saw
Studied Cool J, studied Kool G, studied Ice-T
Now I meet little homies that say they study me

[Hook: DJ Romes]
(Take it back)
(What we gonna do right here is go back)
(Take it back)
(Way back)
(Take it back)
(Back in the days when I was a teenager)
(Take it back)
(For all the pioneers I'm going way back)

[Verse 2: Rakka Iriscience]
I'll take it back but still tomorrow for you yesterday cats
Matter fact, seldom took it back, I meant to say that
I take it back to the original, King of style, Kase 2
Two good letters with one arm and watch them biters waste you
Take it back to unity, rest in peace Bigga B
Rob One, Roc Raida, King Dream, SMD
Take it back to 1580 KDAY for the cuts
Take it back to only leaving Yo in the Toyota trucks
I take it back to fast break, Magic, Worthy, Laker raps
Some silently claim, but some violently bang on wax
Croker sack house shoes, hats with the golf clubs
Back to educated rap, back before we all thugs
Take it back to dignity, I bet it isn't, promise me
Traced 'em back and watch the crack spread Reganomically
I'm a full time warrior, I'm a war time journalist
Earning hazard pay, Rakka's live where the Inferno is

[Hook: DJ Romes]
(Take it back)
(What we gonna do right here is go back)
(Take it back)
(Way back)
(Take it back)
(Back in the days when I was a teenager)
(Take it back)
(For all the pioneers I'm going way back)

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Niggas who wore the gazelles had all the females
Beat tell in the Benz, SCL
She smell like TCB gel
Treat a freak well 'cause I pay attention to detail
Pinky ring long fingernail to hit fish scale
But that ain't how we get down
I'd rather pull a heist, skip town
Up in your wig, I pump six rounds, bg rope, Slick Rick style
Moet rep, '89 Rolex vets
Poets, tecs, I'm the Polo tech's sweats
Coke heads to Pro Keds steps
While connects role in the LS with leather head rests
My waves laying Indian hemp
O.G. revolver like Billy The Kids
Squeeze trigs in millennium skid
The condominium was big, that's that brilliant kid

[Hook: DJ Romes]
(Take it back)
(What we gonna do right here is go back)
(Take it back)
(Way back)
(Take it back)
(Back in the days when I was a teenager)
(Take it back)
