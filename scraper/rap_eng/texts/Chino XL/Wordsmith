[Hook]
Perfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes
Back in the 1800s I was burned at the stake
Metaphor Mephistopheles, degrees I’ve achieved
The brain fluid it takes to believe would equal the seven seas
I could reveal the true name of God
But you would go insane upon hearing it
Release enough winds to blow down pyramids
I’m the Michelangelo of syllable
Since I freestyle Genesis been Biblical
That’s something you got to give in to

[Verse 1]
Since born in my mama vaginal sauna
As a sonogram, I been fond of phonics
It’s ironic, even as an embryonic
Fed through an umbilical—don’t that sound biblical?
I’ve been a terror since I teareth out of that uterus
Evil plans were made to defeat us as a fetus
Though now I walk in infamy, as a child they had it in for me
Was raised with guns in infantry in diapers at an infancy
The childhood of a hood that was raised in the hood
Cops said, put your hands in the hot sky
Threw my hands down on the hot hood
I can’t whine or drink wine, nine planets planned it
'Til it became apparent my parents shouldn’t have been a parent
State to state we ran some, I wasn’t worth no ransom
Money, won’t you hand some? A nigga wasn’t handsome
Raised the mind like Charles Manson’s Knew I was some man’s son, but which one?
That made me strong, created my poison tongue

[Hook]
Perfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes
Back in the 1800s I was burned at the stake
Metaphor Mephistopheles, degrees I’ve achieved
The brain fluid it takes to believe would equal the seven seas
I could reveal the true name of God
But you would go insane upon hearing it
Release enough winds to blow down pyramids
I’m the Michelangelo of syllable
Since I freestyle Genesis been Biblical
That’s something you got to give in to

[Verse 2]
While you cut school ‘cause you ain’t feel too good
I cut school ‘cause my cuts ain’t heal too good
Through all the physical abuse, my mind escaped through the gift of wordplay
I memorized encyclopedias and dictionaries
I wrote anthems from antonyms, harmonies from homonyms
Created cinema from synonyms, livid to eliminate that illustrious life you’re living in
Wrote rhetoricals in rhythms
I could paralyze with a parable, make rhymes out of religion
Crucify you with a prefix or suffocate you with a suffix
Wrote lectures so infectious that's known to infect the listeners
Who dissing us? Yo, punks, you wait; I punctuate
My karma’s the comma that put you inside of a coma
Hyphen, dot dot, semi-colon, leave you semi-swollen
Question mark, you pregnant? Oh, you’re not, I love you, period
To sum it up, language is my essence
Fucked up in all my adolescence 'til my moms was out of lessons
Laws, I store convenient, still I rob a convenience store
Love Mom/fuck Mom shit; I don’t love me no more
Mentally it didn’t register, bitch, empty the register, bitch!
You just a cashier, bitch, give the cash here!
Or I’ll shoot you in your cabbage, hijack a getaway cab, bitch
Words ain’t making me no loot, don’t change now Dow Jones average
Regardless, we’re Godless, they stole my innocence
In a sense, the judge sentenced me to three lifetimes sentences
To write my life and times in sentences, art my dark archnemesis
They want me off the premises, that’s what the premise is
Locked on a tier where you can’t shed a tear at
I studied more Shakespeare than any African shakes a spear at
And the whole world fears that and it hurts
I got caught killing time, but then I got away with words

[Hook]
Perfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes

[Bridge]
People can say whatever they want about me
But agree that I am the Wordsmith
They can try to ignore everything that I’ve achieved
But agree that I am the Wordsmith
I am the Wordsmith
The love of words is deep in my veins
Must be to silence my pain; I am the Wordsmith

[Verse 3]
I’m in a game full of morons and they keep putting more on
I tutor the Torah, I’m in the core of the Koran
The mind’s what I represent and MCs better re-present
I’m taking this rapping bullshit to the fullest extent
I have reservations why Indians are on reservations
Told that board of education I was bored of education
As far as this go, I leave you deader than disco
Rocking sex and violence over sax and violins
Through your mind's camera lens you’re in need of an ambulance
I’ll knock you to the asphalt, it’s your own ass' fault
Your last thought, I’ll never sell myself short to be famous
And taking it up the anus just ain’t us
The world could get the penis of this classically trained pianist
My P.O. was p.o.’d, handed me a cup, told me to pee in this
The linguist musician, my college position is that my intuition
Told me I wouldn’t be affordin' tuition
My education’s all on my own
So I might have been born yesterday but I rhyme like there’s no tomorrow
