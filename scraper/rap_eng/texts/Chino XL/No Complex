[Intro: Chino XL]
Your molecules are now in motion
Hypnotic effect
So check the way you move on your complexes

[Hook: Chino XL]
Inferiority complex, I got you carrying Glocks and tecs
And got you feeling hesitant to step on stage and represent

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
It's your complex that rips and wrecks your confidence
Creates paranoias inside of your mind when you rhyme
The term Chino's Latin, but I got black soul
Flows I create's unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Bullet holes through the shields of your Land Cruiser
My clique is stoned like they eyes gazed upon Medusa
Makin this picture clearer, it gets weirder than incest
Knowledge my name, I'm on a different plane like Herve Villachez
Getting the people hyped like Monday Night at the Improv
Dive in Ricki's lake plus I rush like Limbaugh
I will detach your limbs, there ain't no wins if you test mine
You won't be coming back again like Sinbad's sitcom
I think they wanna battle
You blew up like Roseanne's belly
Your style's too old to do me like Aaliyah and R. Kelly
Fear and superstition could get iller than circumcision
And things could get more ugly than Coolio when his hair frizzin
My mind's a Warfield like Marsha or Justin
Psychosis be exploding by spontaneous combustion (kill all my)
Kill all my complexes make any crowd scream and yell
Oppose and catch a bullet in your back like Philip Pannell
It's your complex that makes you buy a fake Rolex
To impress the next big butt big breast like it's a contest
Materialistic complex, I make you worship an Ac' or Lex'
Now that you're feel inadequate you're cashin checks for sex
But see, I'm from a small town called (bitch please)
So don't seize the thought
Now see she's caught, go see your daddy for child support
Your complex it got your mind inside a group home
I got you puttin that suit on
Fuck them crabs you spend your loot on
Euphorically, categorically, Chino rips shit historically
*inhale*
Puff you like sensi, rob your shit like Jodeci
Better hope your girl don't notice me
You was a platinum artist 'til the complex got into ya
But I spread new rap styles like prostitutes spread chlamydia
Grammy nominee, wit yaself you ain't in harmony
Now I'm hearing you wanna bring it on to me
Fresh off your tour you don't want no verbal war
Better stay in your Lexus
I was creating metaphors this morning while you were selecting
Which credit card to pay for that bitch's breakfast with
Your car is painted like the Sistine Chapel
But you still couldn't get a piece of that bitch's ass
If you had a scalpel
I'm rough as HELL, CRUSH YOUR CREW, turn you into beetles
Eat a porcupine, PUH, spit out the needles
Bzzz bzzz, my shit is fly you can ask anyone
I'm not MTV so I can leave you Dead at 21
People stand amazed (how could you go on a killing craze)
Cause my heart is blacker than the cotton fields in the slavery days
Fuck friends long as a bitch bends like Mercedes
Invade your mental like U.S. troops invaded Haiti's
Ladies, that are Latin be lovin me more than Desi Arnez but
My voice be aggravatin bitches like Rosie Perez SO
I breaks a virgin's hymen open like the seventh seal
"I'm givin them, somethin, they, can feel"
I explore a woman's vaginal region like Lewis and Clark (please douche)
I might decide to eat the bush like Sandra Bernhardt
Now even the Japanese girls wanna blow me like I'm Sony
But like Mike and that Presley bitch, the relationship is phony (phony)
So baby we can do it, take your time, do it right
The whole game's like Ritchie Valens it should never take flight (uh-huh)
I don't need gold singles to purchase phallic symbols
I keep my Queen, you keep chasin materialistic bitches, yo

Wreckin this it's your complex
They got you feelin mad depressed
You can't rest, from the stress
Wondering what they gonna do next

Your complex is the wall they got your back up against
Intense pressure got you feelin like without em you just worthless
The term Chino
Goes synonymous with corpses flipped
But never celebrated like Hanukkah in Auschwitz
My complex flips
Where'd he get that vain kind of mindframe?
Cause I've been rippin this way since MC's was just a labor pain
Underground for far too long but now I will be surfacin
Spray from my brain on the train -- like Colin Ferguson
They say I go too far but pop radio playin me
Like FCC stands for -- Fuckin Chino's Crazy
But I make TLC stand for They Love Chino when I terrify
You'll never eat Chili cuz I'm an arsonist like Left-Eye
But I can't forget I, heard you say you'll leave me deceased, PLEASE
That's famous last words like the I Have a Dream speech
Beats fat like Melodie sweet like Bellamy
You're gellin me more than niggas at PMD shows be yellin for E
They try to diss cuz I don't have that, I have this (chances are)
They tryin to make me soft like Johnny Mathis
Fuck strike a nerve, I massacre strike a main vein
One line from my brain could turn Bar Mitzvah's into Soul Train
"But I'm still standin", keepin straight
And marijuana helped me to escape like it was Al Cowlings
Still rippin shit, no videos and no Source ad
I live the type of life that could make Hammer say It's All Bad (hahahaha)
Put it on, one class of car that I can afford has not been built
I can't afford cookies, that's even though I'm labelmates with Milk
It's like Wayne's World cuz they say that "I'm not worthy!"
My company is fuckin me like Arsenio does Eddie Murphy
Industry kills, I go for the throat
I treat you all like Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston's marriage-
One big joke

It's your complex that got your carryin Glocks and tecs
It's your complex that got you cashin checks for sex
It's your complex why you scared of what I'm gonna say next
Chino X, ninety-five ninety-six no complex
