[Verse 1: Lingo]
Uh huh
Grindmode cypher
Chino XL in the building
They say let bygones be bygones, well bye, gone
Can't trust what you see when you watching an icon
Cause ya'll fake to me, baiting 'em all blatantly
Ain't gotta be religious to see you're a false deity
God [?erupt?], God of war, i got 'em gutted
My deadly jabs, they heavy bags I'll knock the stuffing
Out....so stop the frontin', i'm not for bluffing
You think i'm drink em under the table with all the shots he's ducking
Powderpuff, your bitch in a man's cape
Shit, it's a damn shame, A vision he can't change
I ain't gotta throw a punch to body a guy bitch
I'll make you lace yourself up, like Marty Mcfly Kicks
You wanna monkey around? I'll flip a chimp last boy scout on a rampage, get intense
I scorch the mic, burned figures get a glimpse
They yellin' R.I.P. but i been missing prints

[Verse 2: Big G'S]
I only rap to cop your utmost respect
Cut throats on deck
And this rhyme's like a size ten on your neck
You get lined up for the mind fuck, pray and hope for the best
Cause my flow is a loaded Tec, so i spray till there's no one left
And i don't show mercy when i speak, but ya'll detect a sense of urgency
Like each verse was murder in the first degree
Stand inside a furnace fiending flames
And I embrace the heat
Then hammered every beat I've ever heard
Y'all ain't got nerve to speak
Keep my name out your dick-kisser mister spit sick is quick with the script
Pro game fist in his sister
I slang next level goes postal, I've always delivered
Dog i'm off the meal or hook, chain,meat rack and the Richter
Tell these suckers, if i want it, i'ma take it
Ya'll expect to catch this fade and i get praised for going apeshit
Anger set the stage, for lacing bangers in the basement
Flamethrower, game's over homie, i am not to play with
(Big g's)

[Verse 3: FNX]
When I spit, you should be terrified
I'm that Christopher Reeves smoking Kryptonite while he's paralyzed
You don't get it, let me clarify
I gotta diabolical plan to scorch the Earth til it's sterilized
?? horsemen, who will impale often
Choke to your video shoot, you and your camera guy
Rapping like I have no fear of God
On the low, I'm mostly sending a message to Pharaoh's God
Beat bludgeoner, lyric plunderer, spirit summoner
Doing those rappers like Mashawn did to Governor
And now I'm going for the jugular
And if I die keep bodies like Hell's Kitchen like the Punisher
Bars, I north star, thunder 'em - rain
I can cause a massive drought and then flood the terrain
I take heads as souvenirs
Cause my flow up out the sun, flamin' Shakazulu's spears

[Verse 4: D-Gazz]
Y'all sadistic rappers, spit flames to the page massacre
Back in the days cause massive mashups to raise tracks of us
Glad to my face, backstabbers, stab with blades on my back
Packing a phase, where packin' macks in the crazy malady
Attacking an activist, practice my words actively
Trashing these whack rappers who rapping crap on the track casually
Catch a battery, you feeling energized and leak boy
Gotta squad of real deals, your squad is full of decoys
Practice what i preach boy
Careful what you read boy
That's the only answer when the angel's on the scene boy
My rhyme's are elementary, basic, and not compelling
Yet I got a cemetery with seven stone heads to bury you faggot
You softer than picking beef with a mattress
Pick up your feet and smash em
Or shatter glass I’m not having it
The baddest bastard within this rapping crap that you have to dig
So back your faggot ass up, ‘fore body casts mass your abdomen

[Verse 5: Ayok ]
If I was told to let the beats rock and beats told me keep talking
I'ma listen to the beats, they don't speak often
I'll keep causing a heat wave in hell
Contract killer, I pre pay the cell
Y'all scene stay in still, get the picture, cut frame and now I'm like my hair, got straight buzz, fuck fading
Try attacking him right after they give up hating
I'm higher class then em but only got my nuts weighed in
I could Rip Lee's, Believe It Or Not
Fold em in half and once again from the knee to the crotch
With a phone book on each side and in between em is rocks
Guarantee you mothafuckas gunna see what I got
Seen a lot, I'd scream out "fuck the police" at the cops
But I don't wanna half court like unbelievable shots
You ain't equal to the people I spot, I say ya done
Y'all ain't heavyweight, ya full of yourself and weigh a ton

[Verse 6: Rippz ]
The Brawlers shirt I rock is XL
On a cypher with XL, these other rappers gassed up
Wait til they fucking exhale
My guess is that they suck a dick probably because sex sells
And a brain must be off the chain by the insane way that the cheques swell
Hell, I'd rather be shit broke than a dick though
You gotta be fucking kidding me, is this some kind of sick joke
You'll cake the makeup on because it's fake it til you make it
Then they double the amount of jizz they take
Until their lips completely shit
I'd rather be stripped buck naked and dragged for acres on a combination of hot concrete, grip tape and pavement
Until my skin look like Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool
And no chick will want to fuck me cause they're tryna cypher their next puke
You think I was looking for friends
That's how I'm trying to get my sexy back
Rollin' with Timberlake, two puddles of blood with buckets of Ajax
Yeah I'm that mutherfucker
You heard me right, Rippz absurd each word gets worse
I living the "flip the birdie life"

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Till I'm dead and then buried with juvenile worms
My name is embedded and burned
Cemented and stenciled onto the underground circles where I'm preferred
I will carry the superb word burden till my death is confirmed
Reading in the afterlife what I did right had these niggas concerned
Disturbed and perturbed at the amount of absurd verbage that occurs when I service murders with a perfect surge of cursive curses
That submerges the earths surface for my poisonous purpose
Put you in an earnest urn where the dirt is grossest at a vertical
Refurbished Nazi furnace that's chrome
Like i'm Germany's own in the permanent zone
I intimidate you, you'd rather work with my clones
If you were on fire and it cost me one cent to squeeze the trigger on an extinguisher
I'd scribble my signature on what was left of your bones...
Vocabulary is what i'm marvelous and morbid with
There's 10 pints of blood in the human body, imma have you leaking all of it!
I'm on some "write at night dipping a feather in an ink jar,"
A veteran man that thinks hard, who's haunted mind is an abomination to nature
It's only hatred that comes out of my trachea
I baffled the ancient cavemen who painted me on a spaceship at a sacred glacier
Prepare to go to war with me, better contact a historian
If we went to college together I would've graduated valedictorian
It's gory how I infect ya, in the movie of your life im the director
That's constantly going off, like Wolverine through a metal detector
You're a rap artist that can't rap, and that's far from an artist
You're garbage and reminiscent of a guitar-less guitarist
You can't click on WorldStar for your life solution
(You're in love with the coco) I'm in love with starting revolution
If my Brother Proof was alive, we'd laugh with each other
How the lyric bar is set to a level so low a midget couldn't limbo under... (shits crazy)
