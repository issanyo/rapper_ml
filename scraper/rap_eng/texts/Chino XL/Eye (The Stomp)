[Hook: Chino XL]
I know it gets no better than this
When I'm on my Detroit, New Jersey, Los Angeles shit
That's it
I have a whole crowds pumping their fist
Feeling like it when we was kids
It'd be bliss
If I had one wish
I'd have Proof and J.Dilla both back in this bitch
I miss
You let the weed smoke flow from your chest
And thank God that hip hop exists
When I spit

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
And now back with a vengeance
But you'se like Oprah Winfrey with a thousand Steadmans
Break you open like a crab and picking off the [?]
Blessed making a living, my show's an essence
Having lots of women in attendance
Listening to this murderous race of creature infecting all time itself
Just with my vibe assistance
Please don't try this at home
Drums sounding like Hannibal's elephants marching on their way to conquering Rome
And the patron saint of vain giving a fuck what a hater think
Whipping your ass like Marvin Gaye's dad when he would cross-dress and drink
Leaving a residue of death and destruction in this edifice
Clipping the wings off Pegasus
Restlessness from the absence of a trusted mother's gentleness
Cash up her stash stick it in Burt Reynold's shit
Monstrous, no conscious
Collabing with the ghost of rappers
I've killed that death hasn't been fast enough to process yet
Throwing bitches out of moving cars like Gucci Mane
It's all fun and games until a Chino versus plan
I'll push your face in the desert and watch your lungs expand
Filling up with sand
Shaking like radiation that's leaking from Japan
Paying for my karmic debt
Like Christians in the Colosseum singing while lions tearin' you to shreds
It's colder than Pittsburgh, this spic's disturbed
The women whisper, it's Mr. Disappear With Your Sister
Prepare to be in the air when Gabriel's horn blows
But Malakai ain't got nothing on the evil under these cornrows
Your cars spinning with chrome's not a significant goal
I'm guiding the flesh with the flows like Leviticus chose
Your frail brittle (?) nose gets finished and exposed
Get exposed sitting on a Venice throne of skin and skulls
Chino's back, and it's the illest situation
It's like the second coming of Christ and every Latino celebrating

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Still carrying them cyanide capsules
If we collide I'm beating the ink outta your tattoos
The bonafide Jesus, divine statue
Ravenous like baboons in a bad mood with scalpels
Beat a racist judge bloody with his own gavel in the study
Tie him up in the bathroom, he steady trying to make an apology
Psychology anomaly never did it for bank roll
Fuck Mayan calendars the world can't end till Chino say so
Keep making my enemies' women adore me
They be like stop hating on Chino before my birthday
Please take me to see him performing
Homie just listen you're respected in the end
I know your eyes can only see what your mind's prepared to comprehend
My pen's the solution
My heart's an aquarium full of sharks dying of pollution (get him)
Get in the way of me feeding my daughters
You'll be leaking internal organs in alphabetical order
A revolutionary predator extra terrestrial dangerous monster
You a predator pervert and Chris Hansen ought to hunt ya (kill him)
Catch you I kill you on ya city block, get really robbed
For the petty blot you said on that shitty blog
Have you taking off jewelry like it's burlesque
Roadkill nigga, tire tracks across your bird chest
Your humor is silly thinking it's sweet until I came
Painting the front of your momma's house with your dead remains
I'm the dark mythical god with physical strength that's epitomized
Could push my handprints in the Walk of Fame after the cement dries
My place in history's established, my quotables acid
In heaven my name's engraving on Moses stone tablets
That's your pen in my casket
I'll scribble on hell's fabric
Unlock me from Pan's Labyrinth
And whoever said you could rhyme, they lied
It's ugly like the maid
That Schwarzenneger had a baby by, on the side
Got a love for hip-hop that could never be lost
Even if it ignores me like the media ignored slavery and Armenian holocaust
Because I push the limits and pivot the spirit
That'll passionate poetic lyricist with progressiveness
I've written serious limitless sick poetic symbolous images
With no mainstream encouragements
But I've had the pleasure of
Working with Dilla and Proof
And that's enough for one life to carry on

[Hook]
