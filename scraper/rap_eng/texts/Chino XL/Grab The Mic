[Verse: Chino XL]
Chino, the Lord of the Underground
Chief Rocka, lyric dondota
Follow the fatherless scholar that's constantly saying "Your honor"
Ripping su casa, repping la rasa, you can't do me nada
King Mufasa, hot like salsa, shake shit up like a maraca
Caca on these lesser than me, thief MC's for G's
While you at Wendy's like, "Hello, can I take your order please?"
You faker than Brandy's weave
Take ten paces
I pack enough metal that they could make Puff braces (take that)
I always pull a bitch when I make personal appearances
But keep that off the record like songs with no sample clearances
I learned from the greatest that taught
That's why I'm so smart
Invaded your thought
I raided the art
I'm slated to chart
You'd hate me to start
One fatal remark
I'll have to embark
We're painting the park with your brain in the dark
Ain't aiming to talk, I'm aiming to aim
Check the pulse on the last nigga that mentioned my name
It's a shame I'm so imitated
I should install homing devices on my rhymes
To determine whether they are duplicated
