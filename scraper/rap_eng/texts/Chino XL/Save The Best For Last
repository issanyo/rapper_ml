[Intro]
And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky..
And..

[Verse 1: DMB]
When you're this high, you can slip by all the dangers and the strangers - these pages
Are contagious, what the script contains is everything you need to make your music ageless
But these cages, are constricting - only way I'm gonna get out is by lifting
So we need to change the route, and start shifting, maybe you can figure it out if you're listening
But the crippling voices of the faceless try to race us, man I can't take this
Too racist and invasive, so I'm never gonna lead you straight to the oasis
That's the basis, don't hate this - you can only reach the peak if you're aimless
Two aces, you can never tame us every time we speak, you're weak - and we're dangerous
So baseless, brainless, so I'm gonna have to aim with top precision
Everyone is so short-sighted, frightened, while I see with telescopic vision
This mission, complete, I'm never gonna make it with just my two feet
I just can't reach the surface - too deep, so I have to try and stay awake, not lose sleep
Uh, now I can feel the shiver, running from my bones to my lungs and liver
Blood spills into the river, keep watching the throne, cause I'm gon' deliver
Majestical, magical manifestations of musical melancholy to your brain
II Kings, Seth Rock and Chino XL - so you know that we must be insane..

[Hook]
And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And everyone, please, not so fast
There's something here, that you don't quite grasp
Well.. I may as well give them what they want
And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last..

[Verse 2: Elusive]
Fuck yeah, I'mma come hot, spitting non-stop, no we ain't done dropping these flames
II Kings, just keeps burning, until nothing remains
Oh you thought that cause we hadn't put an album out yet, we would just be giving up hope? Fuck no!
It just means there's still room to grow, and know we're not gonna slow till we're done fucking this game
So you'd better get used to us, II Kings know how to produce a buzz
You wanna go against us? You're defenseless, so senseless - you're probably gon' lose your touch
I must have struck a nerve, just like my music does
Cause when I get too into it, I'll lose it - I'm usually lucid, but Elusive is through with ya's
So don't be surprised, when II Kings, reach the skies
Hold your hands out, we could lead the blind, cause when you're teaching minds, you don't need the eyes
So just close 'em, for a moment, I am hoping, that your mind's open, cause if it is, you might get chosen
But I know it ain't, so I guess that you'll never cope when they realize
Where it is that we're going, I'mma just sit right here until I have told them
More than an omen, cause if money was silver then knowledge is golden
But I ain't gonna be holding, this weight on my own, I'mma shatter the glass
That separates the present from past, just to prove that we'd saved the best till last..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Seth Rock]
They don't wanna see me shining, they'd rather see me lying up in a pool of blood
I say that you're hating, that shit is blatant, if you said that it ain't ha you could of been fooling us
In a crunch, my punch stable, I gotta hunch you punks (fables)
Better listen up fucks, you just can't sit at my lunch table you ain't cool enough
And me, I'm off the hinges with it
Injecting strange things into your veins - like a syringe is in it
People who knew me when I was younger said that I was different
But now I'm a little different, I guess you could say the binges did it
Inject my pen with syphilis, now I've got the sickest flow though
I see your chickens looking at me, tell that bitch to Flick a photo
And if that ho won't tell, then we can go back to the hotel
And she can treat my dick like it's a yo-yo
Up and down, up and down - that's just the way of life
They say that life is money - we all gotta pay the price
They say live for the moment, I say that's great advice
They say that life's a bitch - I tell her stay the night..

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Chino XL]
The devil hates me, cause I'm running with a dozen pitch forks
In an oven you get tossed, standing with a cross, every little bit of lost, forced to examine how I divorce the evil - *no applause*
Words outta my jaws, animal parables sharp serated like saws
Must be the sars in the bars, for the syllable sickening that is lost, and got you having withdrawls (Yeah!)
Never feeling exhaust, I gotta make it to the end of the world at all cost
Numbers tatted on my arms, like the holocaust, iller than a hillbilly aiming with a sawed-off (Oh!)
What I spit got you spinning, from the g-forces, raw shit, till you're falling out nauseous
Turning down petty monetary offers, sick nigga - I be telling momma jokes to orphans
Tearing the ventricles out of your heart, with metal shards, you can bet that I am ready when the war starts
I ward off any wart hog, killing so goth, turning your flesh to broth and a table cloth (Crazy!)
It is safe to say that I will basically, make you pass away, I am the patient key
To pain and misery, sadistically, statistically, the ancient beast with no sympathy (Get em!)
My hostility is worse than a gospel, or Hostel movies 1, 2 and 3 or a not cool
Introvert nob tool on mushrooms tripping, ready to shoot up a kiddy pre-school
I beat you in the brain stem, slay men, leaking the secret of human life from my ink pen
My medication, in a confrontation, got me freebasing with the corpse of satan.. (Yeah!)
