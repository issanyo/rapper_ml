(Angel Speaks)
Chino my love, although many will come before you
Trying to be just like you, there will never be another you
You've traveled so far to get here
Don't allow the world to make you forget why
Our ancestors are with you, and will lead you
Never let your mental conquer me

(Chorus)

Never love my enemy
You could never take my history
You could never block my destiny
Never did love follow me
And I'll never return to poverty
Never fooled by Satan's jealousy
Until my heaven inherits me...

(verse 1)
I won't lie, some nights I feel like I've been forsaken by God
Victimized, plagarized like Speilberg did Amistad
Unzip like Isaac Mizrahi
He who laughs last laughs best but never again is the mantra that I cry...
I spit like Ming the Merciless, blissless bliss high risk piss
Clench fist, the massicistic sadistic from every verse on this
Behold my serpents hair like perseus ill impossibly
Larceny, broken velocity through lightning speed viscosity
My philosophy, speak animosity keep shit in a bag like a colostomy
I'm pro you're junior varsity
If "Twelve Angry Viewers" on MTV
Diss my shit I'll hunt down and kill 'em all individually
I make headlines considerably
Sorcery with no plea bargain, or jargon, or glossary
Fuck the Insane Clown Posse, of rap their making a mockery
You'll retire like Seinfeld waiting on titles that I've held
Rockin' gold like Dennis Leary blasting assasins sent to kill me
Feel me, you take notes like court stenography, you better watch me
I take beef personally to your villa steps like Versace
More Colt 45's than Billy Dee, collecting disability
I'll shoot out with Bill & Hillary, still won't run out of artillery
While you trying to make all net like Iver-son or Jor-don
I'm extor-tin trying to make all net like Forbes to make a for-tune
Stick that ass in phone booth's, drinking 151 proof
Laughing at that bitch with a gold tooth
Flicking my ashes out of a sunroof
Uncooth industry snotty and shady can't no Bible save me
From throwing you off my tour bus like Bobby did Whitney & baby
Get with me? Maybe, but then be hunted
You ain't no killer or gangster smiling
Or dancing interviewed by Teen Summit
My multi-topical written flows containing subjects that vary
But still all relative like West Virginian's before they marry
I blind you in stereo or mono I'm deluxe while you ride econo
Out of there, broke like the first host of the Vibe show
Your wives know I fuck like
Marky Mark on Boogie Nights with Guinness Stout
While famous bitches give me head with Pop Rocks in their mouths
Me dissapear? Never again, go to war with Vatican men
It'll take a whole cast of ER to have your ass walking again
You're an over-rated player that white fans love like DiMaggio
You off-air like Wendy Williams, out of the air like John Denver
Till forever you remeber, I'm falling off? Never...

(Girl Singing)
Nunca... 4X

(Chorus)
Never can you stop my hostility
Never love my enemy
Never get me out your memory
I am never beaten lyrically
Never fear, go head & murder me
So my God will be right next to me...

(Verse 2)
I'm descending from the sky like Gabriel the arch angel
With weight of world on shoulders like Aretha Franklin's ankles
You liars, I'm tired of all your fake drug dealing tales
The only time yall see grams is when yall drink them gingerales
I hold the hammer to, your head piece flush you! like genitals
I'll battle & bring evil that'll make your priest abandon you
Through translucent fuschia zones poems, my vocal tones are dark
Catacombs that'll scatter domes with the phermones of old bones
In Germany eternally my victim hemorages internally
Until the stench of decaying flesh, accompany Manson's death
If you ask, bet, i'll take your breath a diffrent aspect
Enter the lung get shredded by person to person contact
But beyond that, any rappers death I'm behind that
I'll get that ass touched in any jail you do time at
In every verse ditto
My defeat, you better have more blindfolded Faith
Than a kidnapped version of Biggie's widow
Kiddo, you ain't worth hospitals till im hospitable enough
To put you inside of a hospital after I smoke critical amounts of dust
Thus my mind spoke on Jedi pedestals and roasting demos
Semi seminals who try to test testicles of this mc's quotables
I'll make the proudest of all Dominicans swing flags for Puerto Rico
And kill any blanco gringo referring to Chino as chico
By summoning the smoldering murdering minister thats mastering mayhem
Slaying day out & day in out'spoke'n like a dayton
Rim that be keeping 'em staggering through lyrical pattern and
Traveling through my abdomen unraveling
At the speed of a javelin still reppin' Vatican
And invade like Mexican notify next to kin cats I'm invested in
Don't worship Christ, they worship the theives crucified next to him
Boys and men cringes, through poison pen syringes
These niggas couldn't be stars if they were thrown by Chinese ninjas
Chino you bring phantasm plus you G like the dwellas
And been touched by an angel like Della, me fear y'all niggas?
Never...
