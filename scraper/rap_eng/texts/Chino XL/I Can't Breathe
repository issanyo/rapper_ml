Hip Hop at its purest
For me is an everyday occurrence
How I influence
More seeds than a seasoned florist     (They're Azaleas)
Swimming in the wicked currents
In the midst of the sea
I can't be seen like hospital patients without insurance
Lyric felon, thats sellin' more hell and fire penance than Mount Saint Helen
I ain't come down and get a cheapo clearance
Pop radio hates me, they censor every sentence
Scared of my musical merits and message of independence (Fear me!)
Feared after so many years of my disappearance
Avoiding mirrors, getting away from weird and angry spirits     (Get away!)
Theorys of where I was during this period vary
From the ethereal to padded cells for my material
Artistry in the hard industry, its a mystery
But I plan on going down in history for my vocation
Like Jesus' earthly father
For carpentry fulfillin' prophecy
Standin' outside of Heaven hoping God grants me amnesty (Yeah!)


I don't doubt God is sittin' in the clouds
Kinda proud at my strength to proceed
Yeah, cause I can't breathe
While I'm on this earth, things are gettin worse
I gotta bleed for everything I receive
I can't breathe, yo
Is it all a dream, I can't let out a scream
So deceived that I've become a machine
Yeah, I can't breathe, son
Now is not the time to lose steam
Refuse to let evils abuse me, I can't sleep
But I can't breath


Unmercifully
Introduce you to death personally
Lock you in a cell in the ocean
And then submerge the key     (Gone!)
Committing perjury,to prevent my souls burglary
No clergery, could fix this broken circuitry     (Can't fix this)
It really hurts to be stuck in the Trials of Job
A fires below, eating life with no sign of parole
I lie in the road, beetles and flies in the cold
I'm risin' up slow, the skies, they disguising the code     (Yeah)
I write and it finally broke
The violet and smoke
Tryin to soak in the most Bible and all of its quotes     (Ahhhh!)
My life is like a dull knife when it slicin' your throat
Lost like Rip van Winkle's hopes when he finally woke     (Crazy!)
The death of this art form has become a threat
And its greatest enemies hide in the least places that we'd expect
As I travel carrying nothing but my regret
And loneliness
My lungs have forgotten how to take a breath     (Ahhhh)


I don't doubt God is sittin' in the clouds
Kinda proud at my strength to proceed
Yeah, cause I can't breathe
While I'm on this earth, things are gettin' worse
I gotta bleed for everything I receive
I can't breathe, yo
Is it all a dream, I can't let out a scream
So deceived that I've become a machine
Yeah, I can't breathe, son
Now is not the time to lose steam
Refuse to let evils abuse me, I can't sleep
But I can't breath
