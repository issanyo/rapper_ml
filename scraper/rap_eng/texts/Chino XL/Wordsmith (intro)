(Chorus)
Perfection
Flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes
Back in the 1800's I was burned at the stake
Metaphor Mephistopheles
Degrees I've achieved
The brain fluid it takes to believe
Would equal the seven seas
I could reveal the true name of God
But you would go insane upon hearing it
Release enough winds to
Blow down pyramids
I'm the Michelangelo of syllables
Since I freestyle
Genesis been biblical
That's something you got to give in to

(Verse I)
Since born in my mama's vaginal sauna
As a sono-gram, I've been fond of phonics
It's ironic, even as an embryonic
Fed through an umbilical
Don't that sound biblical?
I've been a terror
Since I teareth out of the u-terus
Because evil plans were made to defeat us
As a fetus
Though now I walk in infamy
As a child they had it in for me
Was raised with guns in infantry
In diapers and in infancy
The childhood of a hood
That was raised in the hood
Cops said "put your hands in the hot sky"
I put my hands down on the hot hood
I can't whine or drink wine
Nine planets planned it
'Til it became apparent
My parents shouldn't have been a parent
State to state we ran some
I wasn't worth no ransom
Money, won't you hand some?
A nigga wasn't handsome
Raise the mind like Charles Manson's
New I was some man's son
But which one?
That made me strong
Created my poison tongue..

(Chorus)

(Verse II)
Why you cut school?
Cause you ain't feel too good
I cut school
Cause my cuts ain't heal too good
Through all the physical abuse
My mind escaped
Through the gift of wordplay
I memorized encyclopedias and dictionaries
I wrote anthems from antonyms
Harmonies from homonyms
Created cinema from synonyms
Was livid to eliminate
That illustrious life you're livin' in
Wrote rhetoricals in rhythms
I can paralyze with a parable
Made rhymes out of religion
Use a prefix as a crucifix
Or suffocate you with a suffix
Wrote lectures so infectious
They're known to infect the listeners
Who dissin' us?
Yo punks you wait â€“ I punctuate
My karma's the comma
That put you inside of a coma
Hyphen, dot, dot, semi-colon
Leave you semi-swollen
Question mark: You pregnant?
Oh you're not? I love you, Period
To sum it up, language is my essence
Fucked up in all my adolescence
Till my Mom's was out of lessons
Laws, I store convenient
Still I rob a convenience store
Love Mom, Fuck Mom
Shit, I don't love me no more
Mentally it didn't register, bitch
Empty the register, bitch
You just a cashier, bitch
Give the cash, here
Or I'll shoot you in your cabbage
Hijack a getaway cab, bitch
Words ain't makin' me no loot
Don't change now Dow Jones average
Regardless, we Godless
They stole my innocence
In a sense, the judge sentenced me
To 3 lifetimes sentences
To write my life in times and sentences
Art my dark arch nemesis
They want me off the premises
That's what the premise is
Locked on a tier
Where you can't shed a tear at
I studied more Shakespeare
Than any African can shake a spear at
And the whole world fear that
And it hurts
I got caught for killing time
But then I got with words

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
People can say whatever they want about me
But agree that I am the Wordsmith
They can try to ignore everything that I've achieved
But agree that I am the Wordsmith
I am the Wordsmith
Yo, the love of words is deep in my veins
Must be to silence my pain
I am the Wordsmith
And even if I never move a million units
It's my blessing how I do it, cuz
I am the Wordsmith

(Verse III)
I'm in a game full of morons
And they keep putting more on
I tutor the Torah
I'm in the core of the Qu'aran
The mind's what I represent
And mc's better re-present
I'm taking this rappin' bullshit
To the fullest extent
I have reservations
Why Indians are on reservations
Told that board of education
I was bored of education
As far as this go
I leave you deader than Disco
Rocking sex and violence
Over sax and violins
Through your minds camera lens
You're in need of an ambulance
I'll knock you to the asphalt
It's your own ass fault
Your last thought
I'll never sell my self short to be famous
And taking it up the anus just ain't us
The world could get the penis
Of this classically trained pianist
My P.O. was p.o.'d
Handed me a cup, told me to "pee in this"
The linguist musician
My college position is that my intuition
Told me I wouldn't be affordin' tuition
My education's all on my own
I might have been born yesterday
But I rhyme like there's no tomorrow..

(Chorus)
