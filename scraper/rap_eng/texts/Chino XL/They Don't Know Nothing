[Verse 1: RKZ]
'Though we never speak, disagree with your tone
No I never needed, so I'd leave you alone
Breathe through the storm like fire in a frenzy
Tryna look for stars and found starlight empty
Terror there's plenty of it. Mentioned my lip
Nah, I keep quiet, I get plenty of stick
Plenty of shit
I'm just finding peace
The world we know now, it's now empty as grief
I got trouble in my lane, finding flames are reignited
By the wars, trying to tarnish my name
See my world up in flames, but I ain't ever played the blame game
I can't be bothered with these fools with the same name
These motherfuckers can't touch me
Spirits won't burn, they can tear my shit down
But these folks'll never learn I'm infinite
Into this industry of snakes
We burn bridges like blunts
Bring the hitters like Jake, tell 'em

[Chorus]
I will find you, I will guide you
Tell them I'm right here, tell them, tell them I'm right here
(I'm in East man, living like a beast man, feel it in the streets when I'm dreaming who to be man, tell 'em like it is...)
Tell 'em, I will change this, they don't mean shit
Tell them I'm right here, tell them, tell them I'm right here
(Feel like I'm in need man, definitely man, 'cause I'm talking shit that they really need to need man...)
They don't know nothing

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
The poisoned priest of the street that'll eat victory over virtue
The beast that'll feast perfectly, not nervously, without a curfew
Crowd dispersal, curve through the earth to nocturnal your worthless word use, what you don't know in this case I promise will certainly hurt you
Man I will curse you, I will graveyard-and-soil you
The allergens have studied my scriptures for time and memorial
I created a rhyme tutorial that'll define defined audio
Linguistics turned to literature that'd shine in the blind and the rabid minded meaning your ??
??
My killer mental been influential, that's an understatement
And I've been rated as one of the greatest, by some of the greatest
A hated monster ?? master of murderous arts
You can spend a lifetime trying to find any love lurking in this heart
The pen pinnacle, I scribble with talented talons and claws
Twisted and cynical as a diamond jeweler that's looking for flaws
They don't know, I write until I'm sleep deprived and no appetite
That lyric graphic novel artist, tryna get his captions right

[Chorus]
