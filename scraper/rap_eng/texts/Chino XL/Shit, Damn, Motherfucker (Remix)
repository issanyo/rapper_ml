[Verse One: D'Angelo]
Why are you sleepin' with my woman
Why are you sleepin' with my woman
This comes as a total surprise
I just can't believe my eyes
My best friend and my wife

[Hook: D'Angelo]
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Shit, damn, motherfucker
Motherfucker, motherfucker, oh yeah babe

[Verse Two: D'Angelo]
Why the both of you's buck-balled naked?
Why the both of you's buck-balled naked?
I'm telling you what's on my mind
I'm 'bout to go get my nine
And kill both of y'all behind, check it out

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Chino XL]
(But I'm a creep)
She didn't mind
Splitting my pole in the beginning
I guess that's the bad luck
Didn't need to play no guitar strings or hit them cat guts
No she wanna act up
Filing for divorce and smashing my tapes like she Calvin Butts
But that's life
And I can't remember what souped me
When I made her my wife
Knowing fully that she was a groupie
Who wanted to use me
Somewhere I fell in love, treated like pavement
A stepping stone
My mack is in the basement
In amazement, she's so brazen, looking for a man that's rich
She'd leave her spouse and kid for someone more famous like Will Smith did
She tried to fade me
And with my best friend, that's crazy
With AZ, I'm Firm, but treated her like a Lady
Now I'm ready to riot
Cause I bought her a diamond ring
With enough carrots inside it
To supplement a rabbit's diet
She's my wife, you're not to touch her
You didn't hear me though
Now you in a wheelchair and she dead like R. Kelly's video

[Verse Four: D'Angelo]
Why the both of you's bleeding so much?
Why the both of you's bleeding so much?
Why the both of you's bleeding so much? So much yeah
Why am I wearing handcuffs? Why am I
