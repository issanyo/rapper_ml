[Sample] Alright. Now which one of these Puerto Ricans bloodied you?
[Shout] CHINOOO!!!

Now who makes the blood spill?
And who keeps the shits real?
(repeat 2x)

Chorus: (repeat 4x)
Chino XL!!
The high yellow blood spiller

Verse 1:
Dark night of the blood spiller, niggas leaking from red shots
Drippin it's from the shots it's the Grim Reaper
That's when you think opportunity knocks
Now battling Chino XL your ass get's flowed !??!?!

Yo, yo, yo, hold up man, chill out, yo, yo, get this off right here

You better get away get away I think I need a shrink
I'll rip out your windpipes forever you'll lip-sync
Chino XL with the maddest baddest fattest status
?!?! pretty as a ?!?! but in the fist I can still get busy
The sight of blood it makes me horny
Don't believe me then try to roll on me
Don't question my story i'm not Tywanna Brawly
Blasting me getting it out working it out like Jane Fonda
I really rip the Pope and that so fuck Sinaid O'Conner
Like Matt Cobra I flex it you ?!?! get it scizophrenic
I have to kill you muthafuckas backwards i'm dyslexic
Flowing you to a different world like Quincy Hardison please!
Leave 'em punch-drunk like Muhammad Ali, G
You be like "Yo Adrian!" mugged up like Rocky
I'm getting rid of niggas like a nigga-hating Nazi
And this is how the cops kill
When I drill your head with nails like Hellraiser
Chino XL won't go out like D.U.S.F.L
"Your nigga Chino was a sucker back in the day" you told some reporter
Yeah and Michael Jackson got a skin disorder
I'm from the street don't play me like i'm knowledge
You can still get shot up by a nigga looking like De'Barge

Chorus

Verse 2:
Beating and bludgening you with any object that's blunt
Illest nigga I like watching elderly people fuck
I'm a famous gang rapist !??!?! like I'm Richard Lisson
Man don't try to cross me like I'm the Verezzano Bridge
Hitting niggas off like I'm from San Quintin
Getting my dick sucked
On the cover of Source magazine by Hillary Clinton
I got mad body parts scattered all over my kitchen and in my fridge
Give me a knife i'm making you squeel like a pig
Don't try to sleep on Chino XL because my dicks is ?!?!?!
I'm treating you like the President i'll smoke you but I don't inhale
Banned from MTV for what I said about Jennifer Levins case
Still my brain's twisted like Mary Butterfucco's face
Your girl's time of the month you like "You ain't all horny dummy"
But i'm the blood spiller so yo i'm thinking "Yummy yummy!"
They call me the blood spiller that don't mean my blood gets spilt
But I paint the graphic scenes of tragic deaths that gives you chills
Half Puerto Rican half black, man you don't speak Spanish
I don't speak African neither
*gun shot*
Now that's my language
My lead made your head spin like the exorcist
The good news is I shot you but the bad news is your ass lived
I can create something from nothing like a magician
I use the occult and black magic to escape from my position
They say I don't get my props my companies mistreating me
I'll answer that in a ?minute? cuz Satan keeps on beeping me

Chorus

Verse 3:
Blood! Rising like a flash flood enough to fill a bath-tub
Just check out the lines on the rug after the body's drug
Slug, since he made Smith N Wessun I give God thanks
Just ask Bruce Lee's son - "Chino never shoot blanks"
Now when I was a young......
*background sounds overwhelm the lyrics for 1 or 2 lines*
Little caligula indocked the fame but after Dracula
Though I may be booed I view Charles Manson as spectacular
I advocate domestic violence and think it's funny
Slapping up the stuck up bitch called hip-hop
Cuz she fucking owe me money
And if my company tries to play me for my ?ude?
Then i get red and dead i'm leaving them dead
I'm slapping the yamika's off they head
Yo people come follow me now and I ?!!? like padding your lies
After me Satanical maniacal devil worshipping
Upside down cross pawn portion evil triple six muthafuck Heaven
Wish I was Woody Allen i'll try to molest Sonia Brevin
*I make the blood spill!* Right to my last breath
I make the blood spill til I avenge Tracy's death
Whipping you like a bitch with no tits if I get my mits on ya'
You're feeling fucked now your jaw's playing tricks on ya'
I got no love for those who saw me scar me and harm me
It's war I ain't going out like that purple dinosaur Barney
I stab you! You stab me!
We're a Waco family!
