[Verse 1: Chino XL]
Momma don't want me to be a rapper no more
She want me to be an actor plus an entrepreneur
I'm still raw, make your dog need a chiropractor
Biggest balls, most courage that this game's ever saw
Now who want it with Conan, no man
Find yourself in soft sand to your glands
With no chance floatin in oceans with no hands
With plans to land abortions on grown men
Distortion got my name blown out of proportion
Been forced into fame ever since I was orphaned
Awesome, 'til I'm in my coffin dressed up
Bullets screamin like seven babies that's left in a dumpster
Niggas murdered over music, at the funerals
The priest that knows of these beefs ends his sermon
When I see y'all niggas back in a minute, my anger infinite eternally
And love Jesus so much? Meet him personally
I'll make a nigga Crip-walk naturally
Make him do Rock's People Eyebrow permanently
Only fuck with a woman if it benefit me
Ex and amphetamine fiend, energy like I took 20 Xanadrine
Serene, verbal marine, curdle your dream
Disgusting like Ed Gein, bury your team
Burial things, screaming lyrics filthy
Seething spirits tell me to spit shit, even if it kills me

[Hook: Chino XL]
In the event somebody ends me
Bury my pen by my side (that's right)
Maybe then the world is gonna feel me
Tell my little girls not to cry (don't cry baby)
My dreams told me to quit music
Too many pray for my demise
But even if it costs, my life
I'll always write (even if it kills me)

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
Cowards pull tools but scared to take shots
Expected to die soon like Michael J. Fox
Take rocks then flip 'em, avoiding incarceration
In a bathroom cutting coke on a baby-changin station
Whole generation of rappers I wanna erase, they fake
I'll drink a gallon of gas, piss right in their fuckin face
They won't admit they bit, I ain't even 30 yet I'ma rip
'til I'm shriveled up like Jack Nic in About Schmidt
You ain't about shit, bring any MC I'll joust it
No need for Viagra, your album leave me bored stiff
Born sick, stickin a dick to Kimora Simmons
Could cure Pam Anderson V.D. how much my penicillin
I said it's illin, instead of stealin was feelin aight
'til my rhyme came to life and tried to murder me last night
Woke up feverish, what I write ain't for the squeamish
In fact, you my Target like where broke niggas buy they sneakers at

[Hook: Chino XL]
In the event somebody ends me
Bury my pen by my side (that's right)
Maybe then the world is gonna feel me
Tell my little girls not to cry (don't cry baby)
My dreams told me to quit music
Too many pray for my demise
But even if it costs, my life
I'll always write (even if it kills me)

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
Yo, I'm constantly consulted by the inventors of Scrabble
I hassle 'cause I no longer battle, I baffle
I'll smash you, make you look ridiculous
Like that homo Justin from American Idol's blond afro
Meticulous, Barbosa the Barbarian, a living statue
Emotionless, dosed up off PCP capsules
Conquering, capture the castle, angry Viking, I'm massive
Comin with 80 thousand niggas ridin on camels
Relying on sandles, the light source, moon, sun and candles
In a cave I witnessed the writing of the Book of Matthew
Waiting to make the Pearly Gates
Fuck 22's, I'll put you in a wheelchair, you'll be on 38's
Coming on high horse, you'll leave with the Red Cross
Draped in a red cloth, of course
My Puerto Rican family consider me the only Latin MC
With the ability to pick it up where Pun left off
Legendary shoes to fit, but I'm an M-F
And if you anger the mammoth, you will not see another sabbath
You vanish, fuck the dead, necrophilia
Scholars collectin Chino's saliva for memorabilia

[Hook x2: Chino XL]
In the event somebody ends me
Bury my pen by my side (that's right)
Maybe then the world is gonna feel me
Tell my little girls not to cry (don't cry baby)
My dreams told me to quit music
Too many pray for my demise
But even if it costs, my life
I'll always write (even if it kills me)
