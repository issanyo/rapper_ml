Effort
Effort to grow and to improve
To progress
I've tried to be excellent
With no regrets
That shit's not easy

[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
They say a lesson’s more impressive than a blessing
I've tried to learn by sweating
I’m just guessing that earning is more deserving and worthy of your attention
Never trusted my senses
It’s a justified sentence
My two cents is try adjusting my lens
It’s defenseless
Now I can see better
Heavens have sent me to breathe letters
So keep your green cheddar
Given nothing but reasons to quit
Not talking bout spittin
I’m talking bout slittin a wrist
You getting the jist?
But I'm fin’ to persist cuz I love to exist
Give a hug and a kiss to my mother and sister
And on the seventh day God took a rest
But I'm not into resting
Life's just too interesting
And I ain’t made a universe so what am I restin for?
Rest assured I think the best's in store
And I'm a test it til my chest is sore
They say that less is more
Then they invest in wars
They stay obsessed with oil
I'm dressin warm and when we storm the pentagon with weapons drawn
To settle the score I’ll revel in awe
Pepper my sweater with veteran thoughts
Quotes from Emerson and Jefferson represents rhetoric in how to be better than flawed

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
I've tried my best to become a beloved righteous man
In the dark, holding the torch to the violence that's in my heart
(It's the spark)
To start a revolution of the mind
But I find that I am more of an animal type
With a knife swipe that'll have you bleeding by pints
(Most nights)
I fights with my inner self
My sinner self
My Eddie Vedder Jeremy better get some help but I am somewhere else
(Where)
Lost would be too small of a word
I sort of preferred
Philosophers once told me that my death has been greatly encouraged
But I submerged
My sin is the curse
With administers courage
And swam to the depths of hell where my corpse had once furnished
Burning in the furnace but my spirits surfaced
Thus acquiring skeletal wings that could not be purchased
Destroying enemies of the art form became my soul's sole purpose
Once my words are transmitted
The core of the earth is shifted
The orbiting worlds tilted
The curse of my verse lifted
Your neck is so exposed
I slit it
Committed to spittin venom through time continuums
Rippin the voice boxes of the lineages of those who don't rhyme legitimate
I plead innocent
Wickedest citizens
Is it my imagination figment
That I could tear a motherfucker's bones from his ligaments?
Minus the cheap bravado
Big Chino with the deepest styles
That run wild like bulimia in Victoria's Secret models

[Verse 3: Jesse Abraham]
You feel it?
You feel it?
You feel it?
You feel it?
You feel it?
You feel it?
You feel it?
Yo
Feel that water inside?
I ain’t got nothing to hide
You could end up in hot water when you skatin on thin ice
That separation divides
We needed both of those sides
I ain’t got nothing to hide
Y’all got nothing but hype
When the water starts to boil
Why not keep the fire on high?
I ain’t got nothing to hide
Y’all got nothing but hype
I'm not bluffin or lying
I'm not puffin with pride
I write with ink so permanently
Y’all are pencils bein led
We
Feel that water inside
I got nothing to hide
The goal's the journey and I'm learning all the time
God knows that I've tried
All I know is survive
I ain’t got nothing to hide
Y’all got nothing but hype
Your mind is fine
So just unwind
Stay unified
I am water
You are wine
There ain’t no reason to whine
There ain’t no reason to cry
I ain’t got nothing but time
I ain’t got nothing to hide
I ain’t got nothing to hide
I ain’t got nothing to hide
