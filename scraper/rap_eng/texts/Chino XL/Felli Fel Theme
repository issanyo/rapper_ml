[Chino XL]
Chino XL the Lyrical Jesus
On some now you see me, now you don't shit, like an African running through Zebras
You won't exist my verbal desert
Everyday you're alive is cause I allowed it, it's a gift that's why it's called the present
Tech and Cell, Felli Fel you disappear like the XFL
In the mix like ten to midnight, Power 106, I'm
The illegitimate son of Father Time and Mother Nature
You'd rather be that guy that taught Left Eye to drive than have me hate ya

[Sly Boogie]
Sly Boogie got the game on lock
When I be bumpin' 106 with Felli and Choc
Flossin' with Vinny, Uncle Gus and Fluff
Up in the cut, thuggin' it up it's rugged and rough
When the ruckus erupt
Felli be droppin' the sirens
It's like when one time arrive at the crime scene
I be tweeking
When I be twisted off lime green
Lookin' behind me and reachin' for Visine

[Crooked I]
First of all, Mr. Felli Fel, yeah much love
The Broadcast Professionals, yeah much love
Power 106, yeah much love
(Crooked, get on the mic and bust slugs)
When the incredible touch ya, your cerebellum will rupture
Disruptured lungs from inhaling and crush ya skeletal structure
Even if you soundin' better than Usher I'll bust ya
Deadly as every nuclear weapon is Russia
You steppin' to some intelligent hustlers
That'll helicopter propel, cut ya up, never been busters, what?
It's Crooked I, the number one cheese
Still mad cow disease for MC's that want beef
