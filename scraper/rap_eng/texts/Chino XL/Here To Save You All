From a single seed off of a man
A man with countless hopes and dreams
And as he grew he tried and refried
But could never concord or succeed
The voices of the world spoke to him and said that he would be nothing
That the way he thought and expressed himself
Was pure hatred Satan sent
This turned that man into a rod
A rod that would not bend
But through its entirety the confusion the chaos
He will be the one that will save you all
