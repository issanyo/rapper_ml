[Intro x2]
Screamin' at the top of my lungs 'till God notice me
Tryin' to find my stairway to Heaven where I'm supposed to be
Still carryin' weapons to get my children groceries
It's one man against the world, black rosary
Only feelin' hate in my heart, pain and poetry
My prayers go ignored in the dark, it hurts emotionally
Hopin' that Lucifer's heart will finally let go of me
It's one man against the world, black rosary
