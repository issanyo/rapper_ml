[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip-Hop culture, y'all
Brought to you by the world-famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword-play, tongue-twist piercin' holes in you
You can't escape 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops the trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification

[Interlude]
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin', look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the Midwest
Leavin' MC's listless on the Wake Up Show
Make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher
Partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9ne's vild!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with white out
‘Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows
Climbed out of a nice house
Through the front window, and heard this guy shout
"Hey that's my couch!"
Pull a 9 out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped—fuck rape!
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg with my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many freakin' needles I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control—locked, loaded, and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
‘Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can wake up
The X-Man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin' from high noon to the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts
Bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of skin
So the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked: "Why did he have to die like cast metal?"
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the TEC with the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board, like checker play
When I blaze, your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the tre, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the Heck and K
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to, but what you gon' do with it?
Tech can give it to you, but what you gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but what you gon' do with it?
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what!

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time
The most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us
In the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style filed sexual harassment, like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style, like JonBenét Ramsey
Now who the master to beg?
Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show reppin' with Sway and Tech
My TEC's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X—bring KRS in!

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One comin' with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget: the bigger the budget, the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin' to rock in the middle of dry
And in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway and a Tech, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you
Now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back, but for now just seckle
Ha ha ha! Fresh for 1999, you suckers!
