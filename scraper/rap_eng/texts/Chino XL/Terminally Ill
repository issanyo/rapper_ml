[Intro: Chino XL]
Yeah, Big Chi in the building
M80 what it do
Rebel Army shit
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
Wordplay is what I made a lot of money off of
Long before the rap game ever went corporate
The first day that my first single dropped
With a verse, I was God puttin' rappers in they coffins
It's awkward how I phonetically talk, and telekinetically darken
Every booth that I walk in, superhero genetically, sellin' out every market
Wordsmith, marksman, everybody baby-mama target
Zoom, zoom, spit at jet propulsion
Marianas Trench deeper than the blackest ocean
Mind lacks emotion, mass hypnosis, slashin' throats and crashin' boats, I'm a massive vulture, raps slack
Results of murdering the ropes, I'm shatterin' cattle and catapults with animal quotes
Convincin' folks that I'm God from above and miraculous like the leaders of all the last past classic of codes
It's the type of shit that make a coward want to settle every beef that we ever had
And wake up on the wrong side of the bed more like a bed of nails being impaled, inside of quicksand
Expand and it's wearin' your wristband, ain't gettin' backstage, slappin' you with my left hand
Your nasal passage collapsin', drippin' like Dristan
A legend at a full heater was Tristan
Too much sinning now I'm barely existing a hemi transmission that is stuck in position
So a can of Narcan is necessary to stop the narcoleptic to the Poison Pen interaction like Rick van
Even if a hater never see me shine bright
What I write will still be the highlight of his timeline
Walkin' fine lines with a guideline, choke a weird cheerleader with her own little set of pom poms
Put you in your place, funeral plot, punch you in your face, usual spot
It's brutal what I do to a cop, my brain is polluted and I'll zombie-fuck a bitch 'til the uterus rot, nigga please stop
I kinda didn't want to put out another album until I shot out every vowel and alphabetical character
That could ever merit or damage a word, my plan is a preferred
Chino is the sickest spitter in America

[Chorus]
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, I-, I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, I-, I- (fuckin' with) I-

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
I'm a walkin' and talkin' apocalypse, I'm a boss standin' tall as a monolith
I'm the author of all that is ominous, I'm a haul off, show you all my dominance
Brought a sawed-off, put a officer off in a coffin, sarcophagus
Off of my confidence, I'ma raw dog y'all broads from my obelisk
After you swallow this dick, I ain't never callin' y'all, I'm anonymous
I hate what the problem is, I write like a columnist, I write like a novelist
I write like my life in the end, if I don't get it in with the pen
I'ma die in a bottomless pit like right where Osama is
Fuck all that kinda shit, Dominick right where your mama live
High with a llama bigger than a prehistoric hippopotamus
Ready to draw blood quicker than a phlebotomist
Goddamn I'm good, cigar and beard, goddamn I'm Suge
Ask me to get on a track and like a hog, fuck a pig pussy, go HAM I would
Crook came back with the murder nonsense
I murder like I never even heard my conscious
Only nigga iller than me is Irving Johnson
Only nigga realer than me deserve a Oscar
Gotta be an actor, not only a factor
I'm an anomaly like a poverty-stricken nigga gettin' richer and richer in a dishonest economy
Kinda like I did 'cause every verse is monster
Monster, nigga I said monster
Sicker than Trump stickin' his dick in Ivanka
Sicker than Billy Clinton playin' the harmonica with Monica Lewinsky lickin' his Willy Wonka
Conquer any MC that I face, Squeeze at a pace, Talladega sees in a raca, reach in my waist, killin' 'em
Any bullets I ain't feelin' 'em, I'm reptilian
I regenerate, I'm the reason to hate
In the game it could change like Caesars
I'll still get my piece of the cake, go Philly when the cheese is at stake
Then I'ma leave you the plate, California, I'm the king of the state

[Chorus]
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, I-, I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, I-, I- (fuckin' with) I-

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Leavin' nothin' but carnage
So many wanna be killas and hit the milla but they harmless
With it, I stay armed and strippin' away garments
Sick as the mission a nigga itchin' to slay varmints
Slippin' away tarnished, pick up the pace
Clippin' the shit of a triple today
Frickin' decay like an animal, nigga sniffin' the prey
Taking the A tech-nician I pick it and they swarm it
S with the illy with it
That's when they get with it dissin' the Tech, they really get it
Whatever happened to him, in the neck, the milli hit it
Chopper hoppin' up and then I'm poppin' a wheelie with it
Set it to burn, look at the way I deaded the germ
Pathetic, now I got 'em headed for urns, bussin' at me and get it returned
Obliterated, the bomb in the battle, I don't know the medical term
Eat when the beef hot never takin' no cheap shot
Just killa when the beat drop
Nigga with the beat boppin', I don't be C-walkin'
You can bet we hoppin' off in the B block, like a whistlin' tea pot
I su-woo and the R-E-D got me washed off in the street with the G-R-A-V-E Plott
Dippin' away from a crazy KC cop
Pass the Hen', pass the pen
Put it up on the paper the pitiful punks passed again
Pick the pecker, pollute the pathogens the pill, lemme put patches in
I'm in the zone, I ain't never knowin' an equal
Look at the rhyme, bussin' mine fuckin' the people
Is it the crime? With the 9, ducked in the steeple
I'm in the slime bucket, time, fuck it, I'm evil
Sick as Samhain, I'm seekin' you suckers to shake and slam lames
And seein' you suffer, a killa campaign, comin' to cut ya
Buckin', blam brains, bang on a buster
When I spit it, ain't nobody fuckin' with it
Give it, everything I rip it, they wanna give me a ticket
But they never quick enough for me, so you better forget it

[Chorus]
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, I-, I- (am the magnificent)
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with? I-, (fuck-, fuck-), I-, (fuck-, fuckin' with)I-

[Verse 4: Rittz]
Wait a minute homie, stop the press, I'm the best
The hardest in the game, fuck a celebrity boxing match
I must've comped his ass any rapper saying that he lyrical but it's an emission like 'Roger that'
Like I'm an astronaut that blasted off, abort and battled [?], smash through astroids and landed my aircraft to Mars
Match me for bar for bar, shit I'm on another planet, y'all could latch
Where's the applause for that? You never hear 'em clap for him
Did it all without a major label platform
Get to the ballin', he swishin, break another backboard
Sick of all the bullshit that I had to absorb
So past to fast forward I'm an unsung hero
Hear me on a song and be like "homeboy he dope"
When they see me in person, they be at at a loss for words like Mariah Carey at a New Years Eve show
Now please don't bite the Migos, they warm
90 percent of rappers got the same style now
East, west, down south went and had a pow wow
Most of 'em decide to bite each other, how the fuck is this allowed now?
It's like I'm stuck up in a outhouse, can't avoid the shit smell, inhale, chemtrails
You can be see the SoundCloud, this ain't gonna end well
Rappers gettin' deals, get shelved, get mad when their ship sail
Clintel misspelled, move if you don't wanna get on with the movement
Smooth in the booth when it's moonlit but I will knock a dude out like Amanda Nunes
Let the camera zoom in, see my famous face
Still sippin' Crown Royal, no Ace of Spades
I murder every verse I'm on, in fact, when my verse is done someone should sing Amazin' Grace
'Cause I R-I-P these beats, whats my name?
They call me R-I-T-T-Z from the A
And I put on for the North and I'm hard to ignore
Here's another 1 par for the course
While these boys wanna try to hold a candle with him
Better watch your mannerisms, I don't think you really want a war
They call me Rittz bitch!
