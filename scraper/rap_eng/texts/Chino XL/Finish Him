[Intro]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Here's a heavyweight on the comeback trail
Five tales in a row, gunning for a title belt
Wearing white, brown, with red stripes
Weighing two hundred and ten, and one-half pounds

[Verse 1: D. Lector]
Don't judge me, you don't know me bro
Approach me slow, okay doke, I'm the Holy Ghost
I just choked the Pope with his rosary beads 'til he slowly broke
You phony joke, i'm totally dope, no phony hoax
I got this, close your nose, i'm toxic
Flows and hoes get dropped quick
Locksmith, heavy metal, deadly rebel, Gods gift
The problem is, well, I say God don't exist
I made it this far with just blood, sweat and tears
Long time coming, man, twenty-seven years
The only thing I fear: my son having to see me fail
It'll never happen, if it does, well, i'll be needing bail
'Cause i'ma go out with a bang, fuck CD sales
Can you read in between the lines or will you be needing braille?
I got that delivery, boy, but I ain't leaving mail
Naw, yo, I'm Pablo Picasso with a hot flow
I rock shows, you soft-shell tacos
This cheddar is not yours
Get it? Danny Savage, i'm macho

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
The violent-est rhyme violinist
Witness the wildest thing with prescribed and unravel rival
Suicidal fitness
By my psychiatrist i'm described as a psychotic
Primal model study person and patient of extreme interest
Chino is massive
Like a 1969 speeding GTO judge with blood dripping from the caskets
Don't get burnt to ashes
The Earth's axis is easily shifted by my beastly slurred word
Madness
Your crew will need a war warranty
The news report will read that fifteen people got show and wounded mortally
I murder normally, your goons get exhumed and harpooned horribly
By the dude that fucked an entire new sorority
My tunes are not tools of conformity
My speech is a freakish deformity removing rap falsities
Verbal atrocities, perverse supposedly
My evil cerebral is palsy possibly, applaud for me
