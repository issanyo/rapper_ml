[Hook x2]
(Long, long, long look away
Long, long, long look away)
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything

[Verse 1]
Locked in a hospital, a dead nurse with big tits and slit wrists
Tried to administer me pills but I resist
I'm dangerous as crocodiles outta tanks
You don't need my DNA strands to recognize my killer traits
I lost my mind, I'm haunted by the words that I've invented
To the point, they're feeding me glasses of NyQuil with my dinner
I associate the infliction of pain with pleasure
Frequently insult my neighbors wearing blood stained leathers
People that never visit insist that I owe 'em shit
I'm repeatedly takin' Rohypnol and praying I don't exist
Damn near wanna throw a party off exhilaration
That I get from squeezin' the life out of a human body shaking
I'm a happening waiting to accident, blessed sacriment
Festering blasphemist, transient arrogant acrobat
Riding camelbacks under circus tents, nervous off Percocets
Possessed laughs till I'm at Bernie Mac's funeral services

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
You've got mental problems, I'm sure
It's just that mine is greater
At least you have honor to live in the time I put ink to paper
Over 10,000 hours of labor, limitless
An undeniable perfectionist that plagues the souls of lyricists
Hand me a scalpel I'll scribble scribes on your face
I make people run, that's why they call it the human race
XL campaign, don't owe you a damn thang
Tear a turtles head off, drink blood out of shells like canteens
I can't scream, I got the metal machines ready
Forever holding my piece like I'm not objecting at a wedding
Was manufactured in Heaven to be a horid tourist
Placed specifically on Earth, quantuum leaps over other artists
Dirty my name, the seeds of discontent were planted
That's grounds for murder, I'm stoned, you took me for granted
Damn it, you think I owe you something, get it in blood
Rick James last words, "Chino's verse is a hell of a drug"

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get me out of here
I just needed some time to get my mind right
Then it's back to these bitches yelling "Go Daddy" like the website
Run away don't cross me
You won't be able to walk through your house without tripping over some dead offspring
I'm getting stressed by the government
Don't even write my name down unless it has "Paid To The Order" in front of it
Budgeted, trying to feed your family is real
Gas prices looking bigger than the numbers on Adele's bathroom scale
My skills internal and running wild
I could eat a Rubik's Cube and shit it out completely solved
I vowed my foundation is built with brick and mortar
Destroying peers like a tsunami tearing through a harbor
Consistantly ill, but still industry overlook me
Officially, something's fishier than mermaid pussy
I hate you with a perfect hate and nothing less
Last seven words:
The best ever from the best yet
