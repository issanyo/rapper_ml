[Intro: Chino XL]
You're not gonna believe this!
This is really happening, everybody stand up
Oh! Tech Ninna! Chino XL! Everybody rise!

[Hook: Chino XL]
(Fire!) It's like hell on one song
(Fire!) It's like the whole hell on one song
(Untameable, nonflammable)
One stage, one hell, one song

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Instead of hard-ass niggas they bring women in
They mimicking men again, when it spin it's freaking feminine
Shit is sugar and cinnamon, this is hood and it's hitting adrenaline
Sinister sin again, niggas diminishing
Finishing puffs, let thy fags bat they eyelash
I clash with industry enemies, kiss my ass
If you think you running with my cash
Ain't no telling what kind of the calibres fly past
So woo bidness, my loot's in it, so I'ma shoot with it
Boosted it, my crew spit it, like Amaru in that Juice flitick
Now Ceremi's necktie is loose fitted
Ninna left 'em laying like a razor blade noose did it, who's with it?
Tech Ninna and Chino's Katrina flow wreck and kill Nemo
Let's team up with lingo, that'll bring us more chips than casinos
Now everyone's paid, maybe cause the gun's played
Ninna and Chino XL, one song, one stage

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
I'll smoke you like a detriment to the environment
While you stand in astonishment wondering where the Sun went
Abandonment in war, hesitant after the message I sent
You're praying that I'm catholic and murder's what I'm giving up for lent
The road that I'm travelling is sharper than a surgeon's scalpel
When your screams are deafening, a militant Adamâ€™s apple
Tackling acid affluent, feeling like a slave when he was shackled in
More beef than even the IRS and Willie Nelson was in
Making me venomous cringe in the hellish synonyms
Fortune, torture, scorching my skin, still injected into my skeleton
No embellishing, Poison Pen, prodigal protestant
Modest and bothersome Taino with a hatchet, walking in bloody moccasins
Been particularly partial to hide a harsh arsenal
Inside a sparse hospital, spacy bars like Mars, completely orbit you
Ain't a record company that can market you
Chino the narcissist, heartless hunter, I will carcass you
When God said, "Let there be light"
I said, "I got you my nigga tonight, but that's only cause you asked nice"
My occupation spit sick lyrics outta my mouth
I clocked in the job when I was nine and I'm never clocking out
Face it, every verse Chino basically kills
So I stick to the script like an actor with no improvisational skills
Dudes mad that what I'm recording is more important
Than adopting an orphan or Slick Rick being deported
Or the bootlegged Jordans you wore in your tour in Florida
Falling for a foreigner whore in a Porsche, now she extorting ya
Sorry ya can't get my warrior formula, you're too dumb
Screaming 'bout money and bitches nigga you ain't got neither one
The verbal clergyman serving disturbing effects
With permanent Terminix for ticks that's coming out the woodwork next
C-Cartridge spitter, surviving the harshest Arctic winter
Lethargic winner, sinner, still centered as one of Gods'
Incredible carnivorous critters, sicker with the killer arch
Chino did for lyrics what the movie Jaws did for sharks
Lyrical Jesus and Tech N9ne, spaz, promo
Past local, y'all rappers are mad homo, Chaz Bonos

[Hook] (x2)
