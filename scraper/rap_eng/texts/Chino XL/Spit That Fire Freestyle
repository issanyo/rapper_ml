[Hook] {x2}
Felli Fel, Chino XL, that's what's up
I'm gon' spit that fire
Chino XL, Felli Fel, that's what's up
I'm gon' spit that fire

[Verse One]
We're here to make sure Puerto Rico stay on the map
I'm to metaphor what Game is to gangsta rap
Ride with Felli in the Range with the heat on my lap
You Whitney Houston in the hood, guaranteed to get crack
Here's another Power 106 anthem
You a Chrystler 300, I'm a Rolls Royce Phantom
I stand up, repping with the Broadcast Professionals
Till our pockets are swollen up like Usher's nose
It's the same Chino XL from back in the days
Not even 30 yet but carry AK's
Pulling it off the stage, folding people like accordions
Ron Artest, fucking up the whole audience
Try to diss Vinny I'll whip your ass in person
You gon' need LL's plastic surgeon
Felli Fel with the Lyrical Messiah
Think of me as a caveman, I invented fire

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Felli drop the sirens
DJ's vanish
Silent like the "h" in Spanish
Borrowed this beat from Aftermath's team
Tech my Dr. Dre, plus Sway is my Jimmy Iovine
These rappers ain't street crooks
They go both way like a little kid crossing the street looks
I'm the wrong beast to push, try me
I'll have Heaven overcrowded like tsunami
(Felli's the west coast Funk Flex!)
Fuck that
Flex is the east coast Felli Fel, respect that
Artist's don't want it with Chi XL
Yo Sway, let me smack 'em on T.R.L
Power 106 and Felli...dangerous
I stay high like P. Diddy's child support payments
The strangest written pages, rappers die slow
More than divorce bitches kicking in Tae Bo
Felli deserve riches rippin' that radio
(Chi and Felli smoke out)
Like we were Krazy Bone [?]
Can I get an "amen"?
(Amen)
Other DJ's spinning like Badu when she was dumped by Common
(Aw man)
One verse, you my fan from than on
Burst you with hand guns that size of a cannon
I'm a B-Boy and a gangsta both officially now
Have your body full of holes like they spots on a cow

[Hook]
