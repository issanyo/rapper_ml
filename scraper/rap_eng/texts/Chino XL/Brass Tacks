[Chorus: Chino XL]
You can't click on world star for your life's solution
(Your in love with the coco)
I'm in love with starting revolution

[Intro: Chino XL]
Detroit, LA, Jersey
Big Chino, highest shit

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
Apollo Brown music got me waking out of my coffin
Yellow tape caution I'm an ape with the syllable portion
I'm biblicaly awesome
Veins ready to detonate from the hate that is coursing
You pray that I break or that my spit intensity softens
Eventually falling, appalling, pallbearers, coffins
I'm a bear in the forest
Foraging, flourishing
Spilling like a witches cauldron
Devouring Satan's soul that he sold to me as a bargain
I'm the god of logic and the sergeant of this alarming
Jarring, jargon and tortured talking
Do you feel ashamed and awkward
For my phonetic fame you'd trade your child's face
For my talent and fortune
Ares, I'm a ram that you can't scam
That you can't stand
Written's flash by you
With a blur on a cops dash cam
I'm Oscar the grouch and this world is my trash can
Hazardous, spit wicked liquid
While this evil it's jazz is playing
My literature is littered with funeral terms
My spirit eternalness pitted with snippets of the weirdest
Unusual slurs

[Chorus: Chino XL] (x2)
You can't click on world star for your life's solution
(Your in love with the coco)
I'm in love with starting revolution

[Verse 2: Finale]
