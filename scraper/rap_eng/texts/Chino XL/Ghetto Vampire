[Intro: Female Voice talking]
I don't know, I just think that's hell exploitive
You know, taking these metaphors and just butchering...
Icons in the urban community. I don't know, it's
Like you sucking em dry, what are you some kind of a vampire
Or something? Yeah yeah that's what you are, what ahh what
A ghetto vampire, that's it
So where'd all this come from? Think back
Try to remember... think back... try to remember...

[Verse 1]
I used to sit at the right hand of God in light and splendor
Lavishly spreading love that's all I remember
As time passes I catches miracles he taught me
Everything except for some old man and breathe the breath of life
I tried, to just accept he's my savior
But jealousy forced me into sacrilegious behavior
Enraged like I was no threat I hated God's laughter
Waiting for the day the apprentice becomes the master
I'm cursed and damned now to be a creature of the night
Unliving yet living off blood, fearer of the light
But I don't give a FUCK right, because I live forever
I see you all come and go and die and burn
And watch the world still turn
Evil entity, time is resenting me
Thousands of years later I must conceal my identity
A vampire *echoes*

Arrraahhaaa-hahahahahaha!!!

[Verse 2]
New heights, where it's so dark you need candlelights
To expose the black plague my left hand writes
Nights enveloping and developing pictures in your brain
Like a darkroom, in every monastery where I spark boom
A cartoon style smile smirk, how's my emotionless killer clown
Synapse behaps relax the bastard black balloon
Nocturnal, high off the herbal, crowding back streets and projects
Illest nigga, coolest slang dialects (dialects)
Bite marks are what you feel if you're my victim
Poisons golden seal couldn't heal from your system (from your system)
Nuts bust down the throats of mad crack heads
Feed off who I please, fucking cops kill black kids
Sometimes I wish I could stop the death the pain and the sin
But I'm fucked up create the libations that humans contain within (nasty)
After lightning strikes the steeple of your family church
I beg forgiveness from God, but it never works
I know my soul ain't going to heaven when I expire
Recognize... the immortal ghetto vampire
I slit your throat and watch you shake if I desire
Recognize... the immortal ghetto vampire
Bear witness to the sins of wicked messiah
Recognize... the immortal ghetto vampire
Who can I speak to God is dead and the whole earth's on fire
Recognize... the immortal ghetto vampire

[Verse 3]
Running from the sun by day it's become quite obvious
To the people surrounding me I'm the wildest
Untamable blood-luster plus the high school yearbook photos
That I took in eighty-nine, show no sign of a face of mine
Intertwined my mind is a jungle full of cobwebs and tangled vines
And a glass mace even my closest friends are becoming afraid
Of how I, predicting what's happening and events
Prom dates found they're punctured, blood left pleading then lynched
That's just how I fucking express myself
When I consume your blood and leave you dead
Sorry it's just to keep my health
Dark forces, police get nauseous from my trail of corpses
No stake through my heart, no holy water, and no priest with crosses
A woman's mind gets clouded by my handsome mannerisms
Listen obsessions bigger than Jackie Gleason's aneurysms
You caught up when my piercing eyes stare right through you
Stronger than the straightest greatest ancient Haitian voodoo
My unholy presence disturbs animals and children
Built a sacrificial altar behind an abandoned building
My sense of smell is heightened my sight is razor sharp
Serene that's thorazine when I remove your beating heart
*bump, bu-bump, bu-bump, bu-bump*
And then the blood starts, flowing
Now I got your soul without you even knowing
Lying in a staircase covered in piss, body decomposing
I turn on sirens and I perpetuate gang violence
I'm the devil that got Malcolm X sleeping in silence
Factual I poison anything that's natural
I kill love and I leave hope frozen up just like it's a statue
Vampires walk among us sucking life from our city
Keeping us in constant states of insecurity
The police watch 'em (They all be ghetto vampires)
The government check 'em (They all be ghetto vampires)
Churches and ministries (They all be ghetto vampires)
Niggas slangin' that shit (They all be ghetto vampires)
Money hungry bitches (They all be ghetto vampires)
The whole school system (Fucking ghetto vampires)
The fucking media (They all be ghetto vampires)
Now who's the vampire?
