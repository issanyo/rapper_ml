[Crooked I]
I spit impossible rhymes full of philosophical lines
My phenomenal shine
Leave every one of your opticals blind
Run you over when it's apocalypse time
I'm half-man, half-diesel like Optimus Prime
Cockin' this nine to pop ya
Permanent disfigurement have you rockin'
Half a mask like the Phantom of the Opera
Mach three is how fast I'll drop ya
Walk back to five's the speed they clocked the
Hatchet, affect, deliberately chopped ya
You thought you had it win here
Like watchin' porno flicks with six chicks, I'm the hardest one in here
Straps on the New Year, we bust like every night's New Years
Cerebral hemisphere's get blew here
It's really no need to cuss and fuss, just
Hop out of the bushes scratched up from the brush and bust
I make the angriest atheist praise me, if not
He's feelin' the simultaneous pain of a shot
And I shake his pancreas, maybe it's my instantaneous plots
The craziest emcee couldn't face me
If an alien gave him this thoughts
Kamikaze's regulate
I strap a time bomb under my trench coat
And hug you till it detonates
I was brainwashed by NWA and BDP
I'm the year 2000 version of the DOC
And when Crooked I spot these fake cliques
They better be able to dodge bullets like The Matrix or take six
I'm so ominous in dominant in prominent hip-hop conglomerate
On this continent I'm bombin' it
When Icon ill out
I spit out rhymes so offensive even Chino will tell me to chill-out

[Chino XL]
I don't care what nobody spits or what they kick
I punch them in the throat and watch them choke like the Knicks
But why all these rappers want to rhyme like me
Your words should be like Jon B worships black punani
And push me to the point, I wanna smack 'em yo
To try to steal my fans like Chico did to D'Angelo's
But if imitation were an asset
There will be nothin' left of me but jewelry, 52 teeth and a belt buckle
My skills are to die for
During writers block I still create this timeless lines of wisdom like they pass the lips of Buddha
Who the sharp shooter that's claimin' that they gonna kill me when they see me
Wouldn't aim that remote at a hundred inch color TV
I'm all for the heezy
See that your record company done hired Chino XL to come and repossess their deal back
I put the fly to your eye like Ethiopians starvin'
Life tedious task, you no longer have to take pardon
You shouldn't have start 'em, you done, done it
Go purchases a microscope to read the list of rappers names that want it
My brain deserve its own infomercial for the how it thinks
You can't be safe by coppin' Tae-Bo with Billy Blanks
I turn on sinks, I rock to rhythm of the water drops that run out
Then I freestyle continuously 'til the whole reservoir done run out
And I walk with gun out for cats that want to start something
I shine like I control the sun's Off and On button
Oh, what was that? You got by hit by Chino electricity
I'm black when it's convenient like Mariah's ethnicity
Multiplicity, I'm out hunting my clones
Rap's turning out more sweet proteges than Quincy Jones
My style Pendergrass shoes, never touch the ground
My IQ so high it ain't a number it's a sound
I'm Jim Brown in his day toughest cat to tackle
I'll leave your brain hanging out like Chris Rock's adam's apple
I'm so rare, Battling Chino XL's like Africa
Yeah they talk about it but they don't really want to go there
I'm corrupted, here it comes
You better duck quick, yeah, haha
