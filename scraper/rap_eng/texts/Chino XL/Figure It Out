[Verse 1]
While pop radio is plotting hip hop's destruction
Don't worry, Chino is never outta bars on some drunk shit
And even destruction is not advised
I spit in Nancy Grace's face knowing TMZ is right outside
I'm with this fine Columbian broad, I'm preoccupied
Man I don't wanna talk about what lyricist you think is fire
It got me mad that I even came out to this spot
So I'm gonna leave this party with mami after this JÃ¤ger shot
Drop you like Nasdaq, strapped like mercenaries were in Iraq
You rappers dirty teeth is your only plaque
Word patterns and layers, nobody compares
When you write the best rhyme of your life you're half way there
I've brought ass and kicked ass in this rap genre
I'm hip hop's Jim Morrison, reincarnated like Dali Lama
Neanderthal, outta my cave fighting raptors
Trying not to lose my head like John The Baptist
Mastered this, crafted this game for almost two decades
But I'm stronger and look younger than rappers that's half my age
I banish you to 80 hells
So many personalities, could do a BET Cypher with myselves
I got a short fuse but refuse to get upset
Chino's such a symbol they could put me on a drumset
I ain't no dunn vet, my name alone is a death threat
And they ain't figure out no way that they can kill me yet

[Hook]
They want me in a coffin
Not capable of walking
They threatening and talking
But I will never soften
Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out
Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out
No way to kill me yet
I woke up strong this morning
In love with California
Instead of trying to clone me
Just put the crown on me
Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it out
Still ain't figured it out, still ain't figured it
No way to kill me yet

[Verse 2]
I call half of these new artists "Mondays" when they spit it
Cause everybody hates Mondays dawg, you get it?
You had a hit and got dropped, now it's bon voyage
You wacker than the last episode of Entourage
The best of this thing that was created in the Bronx river
Crime spitter, trying to keep myself composed like Hans Zimmer
I leave you dying then I forward all my calls to your cell
So you can witness just how popular that I am
Invest in a retirement, home, I have my foes
Cold souls floating in limbo like that girl on The Lovely Bones
Extrordinary, more the merry, blurry, bury, fortunes in the mortuary
Torturary, corporate vary, often carry
Awesome semi, auto hemi heavy weaponry
And couldn't be calmed by any Ativan by Conrad Murray
There is no counter measure for this fire power
Olympic word hurdler, leaping every no language barrier
I'm Van Halen, legend in rap, breathern hate on
But choose your words carefully cause they're going on your tombstone
They wanna kill hip hop I won't have it
They wanna stop what bumps like Proactiv
You're looking up to rappers, that's looking up to me
Like I'm a sniper with a rifle in a tree
Was born in the east, but a legend that's repping the west
And they ain't figure out no way that they can kill me yet

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
In grammar school they were concerned about my mental health
I trick or treat for UNICEF and kept the money for myself
You try to hide it, then analysing my lines in private
It's all "fuck Chino" till you standing in the room beside him
The hardest artist arguement, my murder monument
Will document my shocking doctrine, caution I'm a monster walking
Oh you ain't never heard me rhyme, you ain't being honest
Duct tape, I throw you in the baby pool full of piranhas
I am timeless, even God refused to age me
Uncage me, don't break bread, break the whole bakery
Instead of thanking me, you'd rather anger me
Strangle me with the red tape of this corporate system but I've existed
Before Interscope, before Courtney Love was on dope
Before music downloads, before this current pope
Before rappers stole my quotes, before Heath Ledger's overdose
Before Sarah Palin had Glen Rice all in her throat
Before there was a Death Row
Before Big Pimpin' and mink coats or Jay-Z owned a boat
Before Katt Williams told a joke
I've been cold before a black candidate Rocked The Vote
Before Lauryn won Grammy's for songs that her and Vada wrote
Chino you can't be the best, not enough records sold
But turn on videos that handling these human turds like gold
My effect on the game is enormous, no side talk
Refuse to fall through the cracks like dog piss on the sidewalk
When I finally retire and end my career
There will be enough sadness to rival Jennifer Hudson's tears
I peel myself off the cross and the world is stressed
Cause they ain't figured out no way that they can kill me yet

[Hook]
