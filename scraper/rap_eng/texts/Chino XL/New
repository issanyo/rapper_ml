Intro: Chino XL

Yeah....this some cool shit
Yo I don't wanna, like, we ain't want no new niggas, like
I don't fuck with anybody I ain't know already, like, for decades and shit
You know what I'm saying? This is just...not that kind of thing
Im high as shit


Verse 1: Chino XL
I'm in the whirlwind, got that Puerto Rican tornado turnt that'll more than likely pull your girl in
I'm Rocky in Russia training in that shearling
That ?'ll ? bury you in Berlin
Syllable surfin' every vowel that I howl like I'm thirstin' spurtin' verses that'll  make you uncertain that I'm even a person
Leavin' the Percocets perkin'
Even having a perfect perky tits twerkin' in a purple shirt
Heathen she's schemin' trying to make me morph into her boyfriend
She must be on morphine
Maybe my ? that'll make her a a pre-abortion toy-thing
Imitating lyricists I am a rap survival I want a copyright infringement lawsuit against the holy bible
I am not your fan I am not a disciple
I'm prime when I slap you across the face with a motorcycle
My syllables slash like that of the last airbender
Not wearing tight pants givin' me cramps like a transgender
I'm liable to give a rival a ? lobotomy and all them Twitter's and meme's they all apply to me
Don't try to chat up the man that ran up the Jacob's ladder
That'll I'll emphatically flatten any rap cat turn 'em into fecal matter
You got bars but your image is something I can't feel
My nigga Smitty drop drums over your head like an anvil
I'm made out of steel my haters will never prevail
No new people in my circle the devils that want to try to level the playing field


Chorus: Spider da God
I don't really bang wit new niggas
I dont really hang wit new niggas
They all sound the same, you could probably interchange these new niggas
They all rob the game 'just to the gain a few figures
It's really a shame that they play these new niggas
If you don't like it them I'm sayin it to you nigga
It's really a shame that they play these new niggas
If you don't like it them I'm saying it to you nigga


Verse 2: Pacewon
I've been on my rap star bullshit but I'm so fresh
I get applause even if I wear a rhinestone vest
The standin', ovations that your rhymes don't get
Ladies pee everytime they see my dibo? flex
And even if we don't click and our minds don't mesh I won't stress, I'll giggle
Like I'm being tickled I'm so blessed
That the sun always shines on my whole set
Even when it's cloudy and the skies sound stormy
I beam the son's life is always shinin' down on me
And i absorb every particle, if this was Lucy I'd be Scarlet Jo
When I rock the floor people move like the owner's about to lock the door
And rap fiends come back 'cause I got the raw
And I've had it since the Fuji's? rocked the score, motherfucker
It's like, everything this generation is faded
All the policies, the world is changing
So these young boys, don't wanna listen to nothing but ?
But I can see it in their eyes that they wanna be great
But I can see they shook
And I told 'em why I be where when, we can be werewolves


Chorus: Spider da God
I don't really bang wit new niggas
I dont really hang wit new niggas
They all sound the same, you could probably interchange these new niggas
They all rob the game 'just to the gain a few figures
It's really a shame that they play these new niggas
If you don't like it them I'm sayin it to you nigga
It's really a shame that they play these new niggas
If you don't like it them I'm saying it to you nigga


Verse 3: Spider Da God
If I had twenty four hours to live, I picked the worst option
Run up on one of these rappers while they purse shoppin'
Fists clenching knees mend? with niggas that swift
Gimmicks'll a buck, fifty limit with bitch gettin' disease
Now all these niggas do is Jigga's poofs on Youtube
Used to make 'em say WHOO, now they make 'em say (Oooo)
Any nigga rap with me then understand we as ?
Swi? doing numbers but the poof got a math degree
Get you baptized nigga! Clap on camera
Warning shot he won't miss you again this ain't the Fab Five
If you been clockin' then it's obvious nigga
I fell in with animals shit I won't stop for my nigga
I'm like the D.O.C. and G or G.O.D
They say these niggas is fat
So unless you wanna see your spleen, then stay with the bars
While I'll kill a new nigga and Mayweather the charge


Chorus: Spider da God
I don't really bang wit new niggas
I dont really hang wit new niggas
They all sound the same, you could probably interchange these new niggas
They all rob the game 'just to the gain a few figures
It's really a shame that they play these new niggas
If you don't like it them I'm sayin it to you nigga
It's really a shame that they play these new niggas
If you don't like it them I'm saying it to you nigga
