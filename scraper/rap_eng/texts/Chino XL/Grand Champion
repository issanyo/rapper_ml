Latin rapper... buffle your skull
Grand Champ...
Master the Flow

[Verse 1 : Chris Rivers]
Grand Champion, shit you wish your man was on
I've been riding solo through hell just to put my family on
Babylon, searching for passion stronger than Akeron
Passing raps, I stack 'em to sad 'em, add 'em, need Avion
Deviant, plays a stage a stadium, raise 'em like bulls in cages
Run my cadence, they putting work like gymnasiums
State in never basic, see my cateress raising hate is in
Trying to breach the top of the border like I was Canadian
Crazy when your dreams seem to emerge into reality
Demons peep my energy and purging like a battery
But take a seat, have a second see{​​​​?] with your family
Each bar is Mona Lisa, each verse is a fucking Masterpiece
God, I know I pray to you, struggling at paying my dues
Been loyal to my brothers, ain't no canine able to disable{​​​​?]
And words of physics if it ever came in too{​​​​?]
But I've been living so blunt, it showed me what I came to do
True, it's Rivers

[Verse 2 : Smooth Vega]
This path that I walk, got to give, got the glory
Could still get back, I stand and tell my story
The Grand Champ, I am that, you can't ignore me
Scram fast to rap fast, starts to bore me
These young niggas fucking up the game, it's statutory
[?], in my category
Regardless of whether or not you would bore me
I'mma do what no one has ever done before me
So let's get it crackin, I'm here to make it happen
Revolutionize what one could do as a Latin
I ain't got rap about trapping and click-clacking
This ain't a jab or a stab, it's a fact, niggas acting
I'm spazzing, reacting to the rumbling niggas be mumbling
It's buffling, the lack of content this niggas be rapping with
I've had it with the asterisks, these faggots mastered in
So you about to feel the abdomen and wrath of a dragon spittin

Talk to them...

[Verse 3 : Chino XL]
They said I'd never be a respected lyricist cause I'm a Latino
Till I started outshining and shitting on their favorite people
Bar for bar without mercy and without equal
Fuck the Boogie Man, children should be taught to be scared of Chino
It is him referred to as "grimy" even by the Grim Reaper
Murder a thin diva disguised as a grimy rhyme preacher
Downhills vines but I climb deeper
Perfoming a perfect pattern procedures
Scribbling a fallible unassimilable syllabes
Written in cost formocy [?]
Enormous story but glory seizures[?]
And I am in the only hobby to body who copy bottomfeeders[?]
The cursed creature, the version of beast that sacreats[?] ether
Your thirst out to spit fitness try to take all available breathers
Mi loca vida, never choked a beat up
Since a kid listening to Rakims vocals
"I ain't no joke", through them broken speakers
Turning locals to ca mida a mida[?]
Put your Naples at commose [??]
To see why they scream "Viva the Puerto Rican Jesus!"
Conceit us that feeble and fable, we both evil and able
Cross porose Chi with the Diesel, that amazing hero that fears zero
I'm Magneto attracting that metal when they killed his mama
Sicker than Zimmermans karma, unveiling horror
Razorblade facecarver, yet tomorrow to end my familys poverty
Sorrow no problem, have you bleeding caps[?] all over your armor
The bare confronted religious questions crying confessions
Got to win for my children, my daughters are my pride and blessing
Ten pints of blood in the human body, you gonna leak all of it
Fuck rap, my name should be a title of a lyricism scholarship
When thrown to the rap pantheon, Chino the Grand Champion
Punch you pancreas to oblivion then overdose it of Ambion[?]
