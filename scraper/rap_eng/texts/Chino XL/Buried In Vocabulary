[Verse 1: Julius Luciano]
I snatch the mic from you clowns, refuse to wait my turn
This is the art of emceeing, to whom it may concern
I'm loony, wait, disturbed, I act like I truly can't discern
Right from wrong, ignite the chrome, you stupid lames get burned
The gat claps, call the llama gonorrhea
Brrap, that's onomatopoeia, now your crew gets placed in urns
I kick styles, I didn't need the kudetai to learn
The world is mine, I'm the son of the dude who makes it turn
I'm God's descendant, I'm exceptionally clever
Immaculate conception, like my inception was better
Him, yeah, I'm him, my perception is extra-sensory
Consider me perfection's successor
Rappers pray to me, not in the direction of Mecca
I'm outside the matrix, I'm in the Nebuchadnezzar
We real MC's connecting together
From the garden state to the golden state, our depth can't be measured

[Verse 2: Demetrius Capone]
Rough and raw crank, clutch my balls, wait
I'm balls deep in your mind, fuck what y'all think
You in some deep shit like you crawled out of Shawshank
I'm shot calling like I shot the ball and I called 'Bank'
This is that murder, murder, mu-murderous murder show
I'm an insurgent in surgeon, cause with this burner I'm surgical
Call my weapon the Special Olympics cause that .38's a pro
You turned into the fuck'm station, name it FM radio
My gun will draw and stutter, blucka blucka, raw and gutter
I'll go call your mother and that slut'll swallow all my nut up
'Till she cough my son up and that fucker is also your brother
I do him like Brenda, nigga get tossed in a dumpster
Make no mistake, I'm the greatest atheist, niggas know me
As they savior so pray or I'm making you niggas holy
Faker than silicone, you gay cause you niggas only
Going in on some shit when you raping your little homie

[Verse 3: Dice]
You niggas thinking you're sick, come and get your flu shots
After shots flew, drop you, then your crew drop
I'm letting a couple more fly, call that a new flock
Shots might break south, bullets through ya tube socks
I'll squeeze the MAC, leave you flat
Become a thing of the recent past
The only time your family sees you is when they dreamin, thinking back
Heat'll clap, leave you cats leaking for thinking and speaking bad
Put you niggas asleep in a bag, and I ain't speaking on sleeping bags
You say you on top of the city, like you Nino Brown
I'm able to leap tall buildings in a single bound
My shots leave your head spinning, fuck drunk or tipsy
I pull up, niggas break like the lunch truck is with me
I'll leave a punk chump slumped, such a fucking pity
I fuck monastery bitches, nuns fucking with me

[Verse 4: Kenny Siegel]
Hold a sec, I'mma thumb through my mental rap rolodex
And ass rape dummies, crash test dummy, I'm known to wreck
You make me sick to my stomach, your flow upset my solar plexus
I'll blow the TEC, now you in hell like you trying to hold ya breath
Nigga, I'm about as bad as your luck from a mirror crack
I'll twist a nigga's head near his back 'till I hear a snap
These niggas so soft that they gushy (less dangerous)
Yes, wankstas, (they rookies), sex changes, (fake pussies)
My flow's hot and liquid, it belongs in a f'n thermos
Toxic hot spit, send you niggas epidermis
Test and learn that death is hurtin'
Get urked when TECs is burstin'
Get murked when weapon's spurtin'
Leave holy as a reverend's sermon
I got these niggas wondering, how could a villain be so nice
I don't mean the internet, when I say I'm killing them on site
I'm dope, I'm great white, a great white from the beach
Want beef? The clips to my pistols all that's gon' come in peace

[Verse 5: Chino XL]
I'm spittin' it intricate, I belong to a sin syndicate
With infinite ways of killin' shit, and discriminantly I am different
Magnificently significant, specifically causing pestilence
I'm the infamous, God's instrument
Chino born of a hideous chrysalis with pistol whips
No questions, my impression is you feelin' nervousness
See heaven and hell, both ignoring your prayers
Keep talking, motherfucker, I'm killing your parents
Every nightmare got a Chino appearance
Ghetto vampire, no reflection in the mirrors
Turn your lights off, it's about to get serious
This is the type of song that'll make you change careers
Lyricy, terror see, never see, heresy, jealousy, lunacy, menacing
Energy, fantasy, medicine, pedigree
And I see hemorrhaging enemies in prison and banished
Do 'em like venison and take advantage of 'em
You can bet that I be cuttin' like a mad man Russian
Everybody wanna kill the Puerto Rican superhero
Till they hear the evil and they see the chainsaw buzzing
Chino's an animal outside your castle with catapults
From mass assaults with more soldiers and dogs than any land can hold
Launching, aiming flaming fire crossbows through the air and fog
Tear apart the endless walls and tears and scars and weird remarks
Pray I'm lost beneath the forest, stinkin' corpse deep in the moss
But the beast evolved, speak to God, unsheath my sword (So meet the morgue)
Send in the military minotaurs
Bullets melt through you’re Mercede's metal doors
Brolic bully bizarre
You’ll be a skeleton skippin' skillfully through the graveyard
Medici madman, I got a gattle and it ain't matter
And I stay clappin' and straddlin' fragments of clavicle in chin
Collected in a medical metal tin
Straight jacket, insane bastard, for a strange jackal
To his face fractured from evasive cactus
I’m the breed that’ll feed a human centipede laxatives
My work ethic is epic, ethnic, eccentric, electric
Unexpectedly eclectic
It's nothing to get the women naked
I'll hop in a time machine and petition your birth
And get it signed by anyone that will ever walk on the face of this Earth
Not Luciferian, stop worrying about this brother Chino
That's unnecessary like fertility drugs in Puerto Rico
You're now witnessing the RICANstruction experience
Change my name to miscarriage, Chino's the sickest period
