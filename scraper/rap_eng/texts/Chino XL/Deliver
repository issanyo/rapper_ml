[Intro: KutMasta Kurt]
Yeah, to all the real hardcore motherfuckers, soft motherfuckers
With the bitches that don't give a fuck

[Hook: Chino XL]
Now who wanna diss to get they reps a little bigger?
How many bitches wanna fuck this yellow nigga?
You get your whole crew cut like a scissor
Watch this world shake from the album I deliver

[Verse 1: : Chino XL]
I threw a Brownstone at Brandy now she's Changing Faces
Standing in my Aaron Hall, I'm Blackstreet packing suitcases
Going back to Indiana on the Subway
Soul for Real, Miss Jones is my Usher in church on Sundays
Clear the runways cause I'ma make you rappers my examples
Avoiding battling me like I'm Eazy-E's blood samples
It's me and Carey, nah never wrote no rhyme that's ordinary
Won't throw my life away on coke like Darryl Strawberry
Removing you skeletal system playing your ribs like xylophones
I'm nastier, leave you scraped and ashier than Larry Holmes
But ladies I ain't always violent
You could pump pump until the dawn like Adina Howard
Can't you see I'm notorious as Total get
Uptown girls in bed like Billy Joel do
Laverne and Shirle, give us any rule we'll break it
Remember you was wack remember Ice Cube had a jheri curl
BAMMMMM!!!! Dead on your car horn chump
My beat get messy as abortion on the ninth month
Now who be that, slap, did I do that?
Not Whoopi Goldberg or Steve Urkel but I'll leave your grill the color purple
Give you a dog pound, could even put Dru down
Provoke me album is weak your whole shit sound like karaoke
Conversation, loss of limbs, amputation
Head meaning decapitation rough like Craig Mack derm abrasion
Evil tendency, strong like Miles Davis heroin dependency
Fuckin up lives like teenage pregnancy

[Hook: Chino XL]

[Verse 2: : Chino XL]
Them clowns like Will Smith got fast cars and fancy homes
But I'm headstrong, I could even break puffy combs
Some kids still doubtin and they girlfriend stalkin keep it real
We'll cross that bridge when we come to that Anita Hill
Now Everlast will never last with no ghetto pass
Leave you breathin hard like bitches at lamaze class
Niggas are slippin when they sippin gin and tonic
Smokin chronic Jersey niggas packin more handguns than Harry Connick
My style is welfare, half of you bitches is on it
Was born with a halo, when broke I had to pawn it
I stir up controversy and sell I'm like Sister Souljah
So bring out bum-ass Russell Simmons cause comedy's over
The Lucci I'm worth is enough to deficit a nation
With media coverage like a hostage situation
Yeah and if you lovin them hoes you better bounce back
Tryna make that bitch your wife she fucked
The whole New Jersey Drive soundtrack
High like Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jams on tour
Rrrraahahrra rrrarhraarah I rips it like a chainsaw
Dig deep as truth go ahead and shoot your Karl Kani suit
In shock absorb attire and I'm wide like a police informant
Pray with one eye open, shootin more lead than Zeppelin
Dysfunctional like the Jackson's, death is my obsession
You comin through with thirty cowards, think you causin fear
Rush lookin bust in your boosted Donna Karan gear
Now fuck the po-po, beats down the 5-0
Been there, done that, do it again tomorrow nigga
Sometimes I vibe inside a spot where nobody else knows me
Until I come hot steppin like Ini Kamoze
