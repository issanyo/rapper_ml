[Verse 1: Chino XL]
This liquor that I'm drinking is making time move slow
The woman that I'm riding with is hot, straight pyro
The sickest lyricist alive, yeah I know
I'm thankful that my underground fans allowing me to grow
I'm stuck in a dark hole, sparking a long road
Living on a prayer, no fear but going hard at every show
They told me I should quit
They said I'd never make a cent
But those that told me that, look where they at, they insignificant
Me? Magnificent
The key? With discipline
My speech? It pays the rent
O.G.'s wanna see me win
The streets love to see a champion with his dues paid
Making sure his babies eat not living off of Kool-Aid
Stayed on my path, ran my own race
Now I piss on 100 dollar bills to see the look on Ben Franklin's face
It's my moment, I won't let a hater ruin
Cause dogs only bark at cars when they moving
I'm moving

[Hook: Chino XL]
I got to do this for my babies
I'm gone, haters sorry you didn't break me
As a kid, in my own blood they tried to bathe me
Now I'm getting my money and now looking back I'm gone
Yo I am gone and I am never coming back again
Yeah I am gone and I am never coming back again

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
There's something about the California breeze
Puffing on that strawberry, staring through the palm trees
Flash back, memories, dirty kid in dungarees
Them nights I cried myself to sleep, like "God won't you rescue me please?"
Not realizing that I was born with the heart of a lion
Dope that my homies was selling, dope that my momma was buying
My horizon's wide and Lyric Jesus gotta put it all behind me
I'm so blessed, can't let my past crucify me
This life has exceeded a lot of my expectations
Everyday my eyes are open is a cause for celebrating
I'm pushing big whips and all my daughters growing healthy
Did it all from spitting ridiculous, what you gon' tell me?
(Nothing man)
Absolutely, living till some bastard shoot me
Angels wanna recruit me, I'm putting my soul on this loose leaf
Longevity, my trophy you can quote me
I'm getting rid of my filthy habits like a nun's dirty laundry

[Hook: Chino XL]
I got to do this for my babies
I'm gone, haters sorry you didn't break me
As a kid, in my own blood they tried to bathe me
Now I'm getting my money and now looking back I'm gone
Yo I am gone and I am never coming back again
Yeah I am gone and I am never coming back again

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
I'm insanely focused on my goal with every breath
So anything negative that you say won't hold my interest
Yo I've been blessed with lyrics and a mind that's so complex
That even in this superless form, listeners will be impressed
I'm restlessly aggressive to laugh and enjoy success
Not crying all stressed, relying on a bulletproof vest
Hiding behind bodyguards, catching cardiac arrest
I'm staying fresh until my name is messaged across Heaven's desk
When I'm gone I want them to say that I did it best
My pet scorpions having a field day with your flesh
I keep on pushing, not even taking a day to rest
So things are finally coming together like tantric sex
You gotta work harder when they say you can't make it
It's a cold game like playing ice hockey naked
My advice, if you don't make music that's from your heart
Just avoid the shit like you're barefooted at a dog park

[Hook: Chino XL]
I got to do this for my babies
I'm gone, haters sorry you didn't break me
As a kid, in my own blood they tried to bathe me
Now I'm getting my money and now looking back I'm gone
Yo I am gone and I am never coming back again
Yeah I am gone and I am never coming back again
