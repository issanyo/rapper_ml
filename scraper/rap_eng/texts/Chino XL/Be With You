[Intro: Bizzy] + (Chino)
Yeah, I will always love you
Get what you need believe me - what it do
Get what you need believe me
Please believe me, please believe me
One time boy - yeah, ay, ay, ay {*echoes*}
(Chino XL and Bizzy Bone, Something Sacred)
(Playalitical on the beat) You better ask somebody!

[Hook: Bizzy Bone]
I will always be with you, I will never leave you
Get what you need believe me, please believe me
Cause I'll always be with you, I will never leave you
Get what you need believe me, please believe me (c'mon now)
I will always be with you, I will never leave you (back up)
Get what you need believe me, please believe me
I'll always be wit'chu, I'll always be wit'chu
I'll always be wit'chu, always always always always

[Chino XL]
Now as I'm starin at my watch (just starin at my watch)
I am not admiring the size of the rocks
But I'm missin my daughters when I am out of state
This time I can't replace and I wanna see my lady face
But I can't leave my music either, mira
See why we cry sometime; my momma ain't in my life
The pain that I survive, I never leave my loved ones behind
'Til I'm gone and my grave they are standin on
I almost broke down in the middle of the session
I can't go on MapQuest to find my life direction
I'm a mess when I'm away from little Bella
Away from little China, or my daughter Kiana
It's they future I'm invested in
My man 'Litical whose lady is expectin (God bless 'em)
My homie Adrian lost his son Little A
So Chino close his eyes while Bizzy Bone sing

[Hook]

[Bizzy Bone]
Trapped in a sick ideology, scientology
Philosophy, those carbon.. copies are the real deal
Holyfield, battle the oppressor
The professor never came to be nothin, no need to stress ya
Love letters to the thoughts forever
Sendin praise in a secret place, and beat my place never (shhhhh)
The birth September, identity Bryon
What you gon' do? Rocket here to Planet Orion
How could I resurrect ya, only to protect ya just to do cool
Common collector, that's the attitude
Gratitude, latitude, mad at me but baby I ain't mad at you
Destiny love Jesus, praise God, that's who ask you
One love, one love, one, one
One love, one love, one love, huh?
One love, one love, one love
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

[Hook] - 2X

[Outro: Bizzy]
Bizzy Bone trust and believe
One time for they mind baby
Got Hazardous in the house...
