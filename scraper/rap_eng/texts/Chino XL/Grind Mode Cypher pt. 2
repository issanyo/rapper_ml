[Verse 1: Kid Karma]
I twist words in the shape of a DNA strain
Inject it in the mainframe, rappers spiting the same thing
Learn to master the craft and make it a masterpiece with broad strokes
I dissect syllables til the canvas bleeds
Call the campus police when the bandits from each land
Stand hand in hand and the planet's at peace
Pope Francis, they gon' dance in the streets
When I stand and I speak
I'ma be the man that they demanding of me
Now they're salty as the sand in the sea when I hand em defeat
Doctor Octagon the way I damage a beat
Like Kool Keith
Tell me I'm ahead of my time
But the clock stopped ticking, the plot got thickened the second I rhymed
Was born with a tongue so slick I spit and slip in it like black ice round the corner
Flip it into a ditch with it
Work vigorous will have these cats illiterate
Spitting that gibberish
Convinced they're sick with it, they're straight trash

[Verse 2: J.A.I. Pera]
Justice and intelligence, competition's irrelevant
Rapping like a nomad, I'm spitting out of my element
I'ma knock out your teeth and take em home to remember it
Gentlemen everything I spit is raw ??
All that false invested in this embezzlement
This shit is depressing look at the clothes that they dressing in
Black is in my blood, ?? I'm lacking melanin
Father is Caribbean, my mother is South American
Fuck Trump and Hillary, now it's Pera for President
Change the world like Harry Truman when he dropped atomic bombs
Here to eat - everybody's food, this ain't no Ramadan
Any time Pera's on the scene another rhymer's gone
All you rappers dressing up this ain't no Comic Con
Chucking deuces, fuck peace I bring the drama on
So pour ??
When I spit, hand em the spliff
?? Like atoms, I am the fucking bomb

[Verse 3: Massaka]
I'm here to save you all you can ask big Chi
It'll take more than a Poison Pen to get rid of me
I told you so and you think I'm bluffing
When it's demo in the building it's Ricanstruction
Repercussions when you're crossing this rapper
Impacted of a car crash and you're strapped to a bomb blasting ya
Barbwire slapping ya, chainsaw massacre
Carcass wrapping ya, pushing a shark tank and laughing
I ain't done, you know I'm cracking ya
Then rip your legs
Next time used as a spatula to flip my eggs
I'm the shit, don't bother to smell me
Even if I'm off beat your heart's in your belly
Don't say it if you don't mean it my father would tell me
In that case you're PeeWee Herman, you're Martin Sherelly
I'm noxious, like homophobes bashing gay people
Eazy E treatment I'm gonna stab you with an AIDS needle

[Verse 4: Ill]
If you want me to shut the fuck up, make me
All rappers hate me

I'll smack em back to the 80s

Emerging silver

Giving stitches to grates

Fuck religion and race just suck my dick til it aches

[Verse 5: Bliz]
They send me the track and told me to kill it with Chino
That's cool, I've been bumping him since "Here to Save You All"
I'm sick penning yes while crushing a baby's skull
I'm playing y'all I'm mean and what I mean though
I mean any line you drop I'll one-up ya
I'm dangerous, slapping a bear cub in front of it's mother
As dangerous as having a grenade thrown at my feet
And not running for cover
As dangerous as cancer is when it ain't discovered til stage 4
I wage war
While you stuck sucking your thumb under the covers
Go find you a thunder buddy, couldn't be my understudy
My left hand clean as a whistle, right one is bloody
From gripping this pen, leaking my life in the lines
Damn right I'm peaking, I mean I'm right in my prime
What I write is so insightful it gives sight to the blind
Left brained, how the fuck could I be in my right mind

[Verse 6: Easty]
You won't forget my name, even with Alzheimer's
Yo it's Easty in this bitch I write with barbed wire
??
Fire off like ?? and roll like car tires
Or roll like triple stacks you don't flow and spitting raps
Find the culture get it back once this chip is in my back
Better run fool
Learn the Art of War from Sun Tszu
I break your neck two ways, it's easier to cut through
The Don ??
Aged like fine wine, strike like Kobe in his last game
Rhymes raw crack, you can recheck the soda
Master Macedonia

He snaps, it's over I'm a monster in the making
Catch Karma at the Day Inn, I'm Conner in the weigh in
See what D has, no chance for rematch
Sniff Grind Mode lines, find yourself in rehab motherfucker

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Fallen angel, lyrical Jesus
Chino bless you like what they say to God when he sneezes
Non-believers I send em the life sequel
And I'm that bad thing that happens to good people
I'm evil but I'm like God in the flesh
Everywhere I go I draw stares like architects
Have you forgotten that my wisdom was written with ink on the spear that they stabbed Christ with in the side...?
My spitting's embedded in ?? religious mythology
You ain't got no hard feelings like a half-hearted apology
My physical craft of rhyming is passion designing

I laugh as a helicopter passenger crash


Fuck am I rude cause I don't wanna hear your copied rhymes
From someone I influenced now they influenced you


I'm mortally wounded, there's more to me I'm only partially human

Slice off your right ear

You don't wanna spar with Spartacus

Somebody call Dana White

BLessed is the word ghetto gods

I was that wild Puetro Rican child
