[Verse 1: Chino XLs]
You prayed for me and I came, how far you niggas wanna push me?
I'm leaving the crowds happy like OJ Simpson when he got his first white pussy
But I'm still annoyed, blow through your solenoid
Bringing more Blues to Brothers than Jon Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
Governmently engineered like Ebola for this rap garage sale
By this industry, I'm trying not to get fucked like 2Pac in jail
You can hate me, but await me like I'm Magic Johnson's death
In a box with Jordan's pops that ass'll never take another breath
Cause, I write the songs like Barry Manilow
I like my sugar brown like Hugh Grant, fuck D'Angelo

[Ras Kass]
Now I got niggas claiming they saw God unfortunately
He wasn't in the person of Master Farad Muhammad
Some often ask how can this nigga molest the English alphabet
In one hundred words or less it ain't the chronic
It's all in the mind like Johnny Mnemonic
Before my word is born, surgeons administer antibiotics
To drain the phonics, amniotic fluids
Delivery, to get Nia deep in your Peeples like Howard Hewett
Half-Hitler, half-Jewish, I'm gassed off myself, nigga

[Chino XL]
Iconoclismic, twisted without the use of fiber optics
Knocked his eyeballs out the sockets I got your Adam's Apples in my pockets
Blow shit like Timmy McVeigh, like kiddie porn I'm getting popular

[Ras Kass]
Popular, no ocular, MCs perp particular, but not quite yet perpendicular
Compound fractures fibulas when niggas step, contest the upper torso
I got Chino's back like a dorsal fin
Comprehend, we bend men from within

[Hook: Chino XL and Ras Kass]
Your strength in numbers couldn't hit
The yellow nigga from the Gravity click
You don't give a fuck as long as bud gets lit
You're fucking with the homicidal lunatics
Like licorice, niggas begin to twist
Lay back and watch your idols get ripped
Yo signify if your crew roll thick
Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, beeeotch

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I circumnavigate the globe with a one-liner like, latitude
Put my rhymes in misfortune cookies to leave Confucius confused
The day a nigga serve Ras is when faggots start straight bashing

[Chino XL]
Without Jermaine Dupri I'm so so def that I need closed captions
Won't see me stressed from no East/West conflict
The interest Chino X/Ras Kass like Lance Ito removed you from your bench
My retina expands, my brain is trapped like a rat on a running wheel
Praise the yellow God or I'ma leave you scarred like that nigga Seal
Vernacular understandable, you in a hearse, megahertz, the truth hurts
Slang botanical, you're moving on time-lapse camera
Indestructible, dig me like an excavation multiracial valuable
Take you out like Saafir took out Casual

[Ras Kass]
So check the milk that Jersey made, I turn Autistic children bilingual
On parallel bars I create new dismounts like Yurchenko

[Chino XL]
So keep it short and sweet like Sherman Hemsley bonafide queer
While I shoot shit up you're shooting gerbils up your asshole like Richard Gere

[Ras Kass]
Bitch ass niggas what see I gives a fuck who's certified platinum or gold
Cause I got rhymes for every unit you sold
Your plaques corrode when I collage colloquials
At first the buzz was local but now the nose grows like Pinocchio
No lie, no T-H-C, T-H-E, T-H-O-U-G-H-T makes me high in intelligence quotient
I drop fax like Hitachi, exfoliate rap and come cleaner than Jeru's enema
Once the secret within my esophagus is discovered like Tutankhamen's sarcophagus
I got niggas looking for Webster's like George Papadopolous

[Chino XL]
Yo Ras pardon me my unfamiliar soliloquies, similes
Similar to Reginald Denny's, facial injuries
You couldn't locate my transient thoughts with lo-jack
Molest your mind like Oprah Winfrey's behind when she was a small child
Punchlines with more elasticity than Biggie's stretch marks
Chino X sparks, mad urban
I ain't scared to put the things that going around me on tape like Mark Fuhrman
Sexing picture perfect hoes like Pocahontas often
And I'd rather hear Willie Nelson than fucking Montell Jordan

[Hook]

[Outro: Chino]
Uhh, yeah
Uhh, signify, uhh
Uhh, check it out, uhh
West coast, uhh, East coast, what
West coast, East coast
West, uhh, East, ahh
Uhh, that nigga Ras, that nigga Chino
The nigga Bird, yo that shit is large
