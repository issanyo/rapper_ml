Chino XL......I Told You So.. Yo
In my direction I'm daring any MC to spit
With DJ Craze on some world champion shit
Engaging in battle more than Xena The Warrior Princess
Appearing on TV more than trailor trash on programs on incest
Plus ambidexturous drilling like cheap whores from a dentist
Legends similar to God's blessed but murderous
This verbalist Chino is raw
But mentally unbalanced like -(Big Pun)- and Snoop Dogg on a see-saw

*scratching by DJ Craze*

I'm known for sending wannabe thugs into they next life
Hanging they scalps on my walls
Pirates sailing the high seas battled in many wars
Scars revealing fights to the finish
Opponents disfigurment ?!?! is riding with Infamous
DJ extraordinare soon to be millionaire
Spinning the wax classics masterful in the speakers thats blasted
Rapping in plastic ship is spin half an Andrew Jackson
And hear DJ Infamous rippin the mixer mad shit
My skills mastered, i've outlasted
You'd think I was from Atlanta how many rappers I've OutKast-ed

*scratching by DJ Infamous*

Yo yo yo
It's damn near offending me daring to oppose DJ Melo-D
Top of thermometer bust untouchable like mercury
Be like a Jackson family reunion you'll see so much plastic surgery
Fuck worms ?!? lie buried to me
Hotter than curry on 92.3, Chino wild out on DJ Rev's CD
DJ Melo-D and Nemesis
Cut DJ's lives shorter than that afro on Jada Pinkett Smith
His skills are authorized; leave other DJ's salty
Like that little girl with the umbrella on the Morton's box
Blowing all the spots I trust ya
And Chino don't need a video rental card to +Block+ a +buster+
Watch out when I got the shotty in my hand
Leave you dead like Will, bet you every chamber we land
DJ Melo-D spins while Chino rips
Don't even look in our direction like a solar eclipse
Bitch

The Revolution! Starts with one act of defiance
My mic murders mythical as pyramids built by Mians
Or Aztecan warriors huntin you, Chino spit mercilous
You falling down off of the beat like Silk The Shocker versus
His purses' is being snatched when DJ Rev hits the wheels
From music it's the closest to how an ass-kicking feels
Or 35 pit-bulls chasing you biting your heels
I got the vocal sickness Kovorkian wouldn't kill
Live or on tapes or reels Rev's revolvin for real
You need him in your life like Asian women need birth-control pills
Rappers no frills and get shitted on
"K-Mart Mustard" MC's claiming that they "Grey Poupon"
It's Rev's track that Lyrical Jesus' on
I survived the plane crash and held the mic with a prosthesis arm
I harm and play cartoon DJ's like Pokemon
For screaming that they hot when they mixes ain't even warm
