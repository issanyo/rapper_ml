[Chorus]
You either come to kill with skills or be deleted
Weak mentality crews answering defeated
So who the fuck wanna provoke the extreme?
Competition gets crushed to smithereens
Come to kill with skills or be deleted
Weak mentality crews answering defeated
So who the fuck wanna provoke the extreme?
Competition gets crushed to smithereens

[Verse 1: Capitol I-Man]
I step to intervene the scene, who provokes the extreme?
There ain't no bluffing, you'll find out life ain't nothing but a dream
Lyrics like nicotine fiends, I got you hooked on verbal caffeine
I break undefeated records, kill hopes and I smash dreams
Don't fuck around it's going down like lumberlogs
I rock challengers in their own city as the underdog
Busting thunder smog 'cause the vision me is prohibited
My unlimited ways to execute those who mimic shit
Silly lyricists to minds they bust rhymes saying nothin'
Huffing and puffing but quick to press the panic button
Technique so flossible easily styling over obstacles
No submission competition wishing mission impossible
Test my words I get buddah blessed than swerve
Chino XL, Superb, Capitol I-Man stress nerves
Don't find it odd
That I get high with my cock-blocking squad
Just sending folks to hell that's if they don't believe in God

[Chorus]
You either come to kill with skills or be deleted
Weak mentality crews answering defeated
So who the fuck wanna provoke the extreme?
Competition gets crushed to smithereens
Come to kill with skills or be deleted
Weak mentality crews answering defeated
So who the fuck wanna provoke the extreme?
Competition gets crushed to smithereens

[Verse 2: Superb]
I do this, use muscle in my hustle for tray
Find emcees slayed once the tracks been laid or takes play
Whichever you make the choice
Hail Superb that foul mouthed asshole with a voice
The command stands for grams like a drill sergeant
The opposition style still rusty and lethargic
Can't fuck with the stop and go flow like rush hour traffic
Shit's graphic once I break the silence with my lyrical violence
See, I done rocked with the best
I got my homie on the East and Ese Dog from Wild West (Records)
Forced to release an on the spot masterpiece
Test the impromptu and get your dentures flown out
Vick B. throwaway beats because everything ain't straight
Plus got a deal with the fact that still suckers is gonna playa hate
But step to my grill talking that smack and get served
Violated like a P.O. when I spit I am Chino

[Chorus]
You either come to kill with skills or be deleted
Weak mentality crews answering defeated
So who the fuck wanna provoke the extreme?
Competition gets crushed to smithereens
Come to kill with skills or be deleted
Weak mentality crews answering defeated
So who the fuck wanna provoke the extreme?
Competition gets crushed to smithereens

[Verse 3: Chino XL]
I'm Here to Save you All! Here comes that who-the-bitches want nigga
That's dead wrong like border patrol and the Source Quotables of the Month niggas
(Surprise!) Like a condom that leaks
I'm wild like Ronny Isly's eyebrows and sharp like Eddie Munster's widow's peak
From Jersey Streets, Shooting laser beams from my goggles like a cyclops
Revolutionary like Jesus sent his apostles when I defy cops
Twist you like hydraucs and you'll need eyedrops
You die like Mikey did from Pop Rocks as a child my mom beat me in head with hot fry pots
And now there's something wrong with me
Glad Tha Mexakinz did a song with me 'cause emcees don't get along with me
But I ain't Warner and Interscope I got ya backs nigga
My style is similar to 2Pac it fades up in ya
And I get the hinas vagina like the OG Papi Chulo
My rhyme pattern keeps changing like they members of Menudo
Chino XL is the craziest
A desperado like Antonio Banderas but more Latino than the fans of Julio Iglesias

[Chorus]
You either come to kill with skills or be deleted
Weak mentality crews answering defeated
So who the fuck wanna provoke the extreme?
Competition gets crushed to smithereens
Come to kill with skills or be deleted
Weak mentality crews answering defeated
So who the fuck wanna provoke the extreme?
Competition gets crushed to smithereens
