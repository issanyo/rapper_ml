[Verse 1: Spit Gemz]
When I was young, they dipped my head in water that was cold
I didn't want to, but they made me, said it'd save my soul
I was a baby, couldn't make decisions on my own
They sent me on a path to look for something I already owned
Now, if the Laws were meant to change, why were they set in stone?
You see, that's not a mystery, it's called an inconsistency
Your storyline is borderline encrypted with this wickedry
Listen B, I ain't miss a beat, I'm a good reader
My comprehension is great, and i had some good teachers
I stood beneath the darkest clouds, and never lost the feeling of the warmth of the sun on my face while i'm looking toward the ceiling
Throughout my course of dealing with these forces I've been wielding, I was taught if ever caught and reeled in, my thoughts can heal it
Never the tortured spirit, but you can remain slave
Trying to make it through those gates, to me, that's just another cage
Another stage of understanding, standing under my building I've seen innocent bystanders get stabbed, standing by their children
Why the killing?
Why'd the villain bring the light?
Who gave you life?
Who's the "we" in "let us make Man"?
You playin' right?
Day and night, toxic indoctrination, the falsified texts and doctored statements got us all intoxicated/
All it took was some watered down wine to rock the nation/
They got us bent enough to let our children be inoculated/
My microscope's on everything, that's my occupation

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
They say its possible to remove one’s memory
Using syringes and then place them into the minds of another
Smashing in front of my orbital lobes
To decrease my error detection
Enhancing writing perfection forever
I’ve been through the wickedest weather
Was present in the golden era
That’s when your lyrics had to be progressive efforts
Sketching out equations
More clever than a physics professor
In a class full of masters that are in the last semester
I feel my brain fester maggots
That’s madness aimless sadness famous lavish
Chalice filled to the top with the malice
Maleficarum the folklore of the witches hammer
Spoke more banter and canter prepare for the answer
That can’t be found in the bookstore evangelist brochure
I have religion an up more the nails that punctured Christ
In my top drawer…
Lost in the corridor like I fell through the hole in the floor
Straight into Mordor where the horrors are even more bizarre
As time travel seems to be right in our grasp
Diving off creativity’s cliffs and didn’t even make a splash
Slanging rocks David and Goliath paving the highest
Shaming the silence payment in kindness
I’m ashamed of raps blindness
VMT trippin' acid jugglin' chainsaws
Raw electric convulsive therapy till the pains gone
Watchin' rain form pray for him
I was the child with methadone in the freezer I could have easily died from
Some people get passed genetics like light eyes
I got passed ancient hatred for the world and it never dies
Man I’m splitting niggas chins
Bringing a grim dim in his limbs bend his rims on his bent Benz
You want Puerto Rican lyricism this is where your wish ends
Whether you’re a Muslim or a Christian I’m bringing intelligence ignorance
With my twin spit gems
Was raised on Ritalin slum livin' nothing in the kitchen
Only beef is with poverty turn children into chitlins
Refuse to go back to the conditions roaches in tenements
I’m screaming at the sky hoping God is truly benevolent
Rebellion fighting through this environment that is so corrupt
Till I catch Alzheimer's and I forget to give a fuck
