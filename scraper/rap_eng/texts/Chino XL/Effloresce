Chorus [Carlitta Durand]

You got me floating, touch the sky
Don't wanna come down from this high
Somethin' about the way you make me feel
I ain't gonna fight it cos I know it's real

Verse 1 [Chino XL]

Yo, she had somethin' I consider a lot more than special
She's an important vessel, think it's time to address you
In my mind I undress you, it's questionable
I'm not easily so impressionable, but I gotta keep it professional
She's my boss and I ain't really tryna cross the line
Lookin' asinine, askin' ma hey your place or mine
I offer you a glass of wine, you should pay a fine to be so fine
Skin shine, like it's mahogany porcelain
It's very hard but I can't afford to lose this job
I'm a single father and my, little girls are my life (ma life)
Crazy when you ask me for advice when you're datin' guys
I push my true feelings to the side and try to steer you right
Do you ever catch my eyes, wandering up stockings and thighs
We stock traders, our occupational stress high
It's almost christmas and I realise, it's been a while
Since cancer took my kids mom, and robbed me of my wife

Chorus [Carlitta Durand]

You got me floating, touch the sky
Don't wanna come down from this high
Somethin' about the way you make me feel
I ain't gonna fight it cos I know it's real

Verse 2 [Chino XL]

Yeah, searchin' making sure this feelin' is legitimate
Must be I can't get rid of it, nah not even a little bit
So considerate when I requested certain benefits
Like late arrivals to work when there's dance recitals by my kids
If I made a wish, it'd probably be that you would just
Notice that underneath the obvious status differnce
It's madness how we're a perfect package, but I'm scared my tax bracket
Would leave you embarrassed, now you talkin' bout movin' to Paris
That made me kinda depressed, it made me curse in Spanish
Since the pass out of my ex, she's the first woman I'd consider material for marriage
She's a goddess, and I wanna try to holla
Except for business I stutter when I talk to her (fa real)
We had a meeting, should of seen her a**s ridiculous
Said she had a crazy dream about me, had me all up in it (explain)
Said we made deals and lead the company in shares
Finances is real but not really what I wanted to hear

Chorus [Carlitta Durand]

You got me floating, touch the sky
Don't wanna come down from this high
Somethin' about the way you make me feel
I ain't gonna fight it cos I know it's real

Verse 3 [Chino XL]

Yo, If I don't try to be with you i'm scared i'll never know
Or never grow, it's complicated not lettin' my fellings show
I put you on a pedestal, but i wanna put you on a bed of edible rose petals
Scented panties like a centre fold
But I got a gentle soul, so in general I take it slow
You said when god made a n**a he broke the mould
Those kinda compliments from you I sacredly hold
Damn near froze when she asked me out over the phone
We left work early, walking in the snow
I introduced her to my daughters, they started getting close
Holidays always hurt the most, since my ex past 3 years ago
Baby can you love my little family 'till we grow old, this is not a joke
She replied in a quiet tone, she would never let us go
The kids sleeping it's December 24th
She's under the Christmas tree wearing nothing but a red bow

Chorus [Carlitta Durand]

You got me floating, touch the sky
Don't wanna come down from this high
Somethin' about the way you make me feel
I ain't gonna fight it cos I know it's real
