[Playalitical]
So tired of y'all now pokin where it's beatin the most
Put the needle and then put the record on and go
Go goo-goo in the aisle in the back of the bus
Take a shot in occupation and fall down with us
Me myself and I, that's what you need in your heart
Chino XL, that's what you need in your car
Bringin all you motherfuckers that good hard that you been missin
Bringin out them real roots and the truth, in a tradition

[Hook: Playalitical]
I'm 'bout to jump off the top of the world
You better move I'm 'bout to jump off the top of the world
I'm 'bout to jump off the top of the world
You better move I'm 'bout to jump off the top of the world
Now when we jump off the top of the world
They all move when we jump off the top of the world
Now when we jump off the top of the world
They all move when we jump off the top of the world

[Chino XL]
Yo, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Geronimo
Catch my enemy on stage after the show
I'm rollin solo but I get at that homo regardless
Fuckin up security guards, run right up on the artist
Like - you know, there was, no way, I would
Let you get away without whippin yo' ass faster
+Fantastik+ like the shit that they spray on the sink (ah!)
Swagger in the mink, puffin 'til my eyes pink (nah!)
I don't wanna hear your rhyme, no I don't wanna meet you
I put blood on your jeans so they lookin like Evisu
I beat you, accepted, the illest with no effort
27 bench warmers, the judge said that's a record
{*ahem*} Effective immediately - e'rybody run
Could kill rappers day and night and my job never be done
Pre-eminent, G evident, the sentiment
We gettin it (ooh-wee) money from how we pennin it
Fre-quently, delete, your name off the marquee
Half your rhymes you got from XL so don't start me
They have me on tape wearin that black mask again
Right with Ray J pissin on Kim Kardashian (AHH!)
Chino's here, rappers prayin he can't shine
Like mountain climbers hangin prayin there ain't no landslide
I slap the FRUCK out you, ain't nuttin funny
Jumpin off the top of the world, land on mountains of money like

[Hook]

[Playalitical]
If you can deny the greatest on how I manhandle the flow
You'd be a liar and I say ya dick's shorter than your nose
You know I'm right, it makes it hard to swallow jealousy down your throat
Or when you're throwin up from listenin to how hard I go
Get your mind out the toe of the camel and roll over the candles
I'm overloadin your channels, I broke open your mantle
I go co-co for ammo and lo-lo's in flannels
And go flake enamel, we rollin over on ya
Shorty told me to drive it like it's stolen
And I did D.U.I., 'stead it's with a body open
Now I'm hoppin over the oceans, Playalitical's chauvinist
See a big rat body, someone tell me where the soul went
Playa the culprit, dischargin the nine
An anonymity{?} in my past life, now my mom ain't a bum
'Bout to blow this in your face, I been plannin it long
And you can't deny me now, you still doin it wrong
And you still ain't figured out what it is I do
I said you still can't understand what it is I do
And you still ain't figured out what it is I do
I said you still can't understand what it is I do
