[Chino XL]
I'm a creep
I'm a loser (I'm a loser)
You're so very special (You're so very special)
I wish I was special (I wish I was special)
But I'm a creep

[Verse 1]
What the hell made you think the sun rose
And set in yo' ass, fast I remove you from my itinerary
I tend to worry and exaggerate, becoming jealous
At the drop of a dime, wanting to kill all womankind
You are a perfect ten with the perfect tan goddess
Who could sell Evian to a drowning man, honest
She gave me chills 'til her mind went Beverly Hills
Make cleverly deals, and now she think she Brooke Shields
Hated my foes, now you one of they one-a-day hoes
Used to search my ashtray for weed I smoked some days before
I'm crazy over ever goin farther than just screwin 'em
Making me feel like Joseph and Mary's hoein in Jerusalem
Abusin 'em is how they wanna be treated they nosy too
Should I just slap 'em like Scherazade told me to
I'm unattachin, wouldn't you despise me
If I couldn't hear your words and only judge you by your actions
Your love counterattacks, unrealistic terroristic acts
Like the Oklahoma Federal Building, I collapse
I want her back, but I know that I can't force her
Thinkin 'bout takin' my own life like Marlon Brando's daughter

[Hook: Chino XL]
I'm a creep
I'm a loser
You're so very special (You're so very special)
I wish I was special (I wish I was special)
But I'm a creep
I'm a creep
I'm a loser (I'm a loser)
You're so very special (You're so very special)
I wish I was special (I wish I was special)
But I'm a creep

[Verse 2]
I'm back in town, stoppin it, makin prerogative home
She too far gone, provocative as Sharon Stone
Feeling crucified by the very nails I
Made and drove into myself, passed to the next guy
Phones ringin in the middle of the night ("Who's that, nobody?")
Your whole game is getting mad sloppy
Meanwhile in my hotel lobby, my hobby is removing groupies off my body
It's getting cloudy, smoggy, visibility low, foggy
Four and a half years, I screwed up once
But this ain't your first time, don't be a dummy
You got champagne tastes with fuckin beer money
Fearing bummy, we had ups and downs, but managed
Now the going gets rough - look how you vanished
It proves that life is a comedian like Martin Short
You standin next to me, I wanna file a missing child report
To find the girl we'd always planned we'd run away together
Pray together, had a child, swore we'd stay together
You had your chance, should've been nice
Your game is deader than Vincent Price
Givin up your ass like you Heidi Floess
Fuck your pink cop crossing guard obsession
You're half-dressed, lookin like a Soul Train scramble board contestant
(Bitch) In my arena, should I fight or just leave her
Catch a breather, it's enough to make me catch a seizure
Catch a breather - Chino, do you even need her?
Should I take the .380, assassinate her like Selena?

[Verse 3]
Yesterday, I seen someone who looked just like you
She walked like you do, so I thought it was you
But then she turned around, confusing me
Babyface couldn't bring no cool in me
No Love Connection, channel five, no Chuck Woolery
Us growing old together is what I envision
You dealin with him, but let's not make no haste decision
The mechanism is getting rusty, you won't trust me
You claim that if I blow, I'll leave you for some model tall and busty
I can't believe you placed this cock above me wrong
I know you like a book but I just cannot find what page you're on
Now you put you in the middle, your voice is just a riddle
Say you want me back, then change your personality like Sybil
How hard I try, I just cry more
With no reasons to live, many to die for
Now as I sit in a smoky bar, the night about to end
I'm passin time with strangers, but this bottle is my only friend
Across the room, I see a couple with no cares at all
Hugged up kissing, reminding me of us before our fall
Her eyes so full of hope and passion looking at her man
The way you used to look at me when I just held your hand
You gave me vast pain, to live in the fast lane
I caught the last plane, to give you my last name
I'm caught up, my family come first, that's how I'm brought up
This tragedy's worse, than one I coulda thought up
The couple stood up, I'm feeling drugged like I took mescaline
The couple I've been watching all the time it was her and him
{*echoes*}
