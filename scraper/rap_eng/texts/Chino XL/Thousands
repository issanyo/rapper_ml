Intro:Dismal sketches of...Jersey trife shit

Hook:
Fire and brimstone is our life's stage
So we pack enough heat that we could melt the next iceage
A rich nigga is still a nigga, just harder to fade (why?)
There's thousands of ways to get payed (x5)

Verse 1:
I'm that type of rapper that'll take half an album in advance
(And do the hustle) and I don't mean that 70's dance
The king of punch lines, I do what I gotta for my bank roll
Slicing yayo with powder with my bass latter gettin' dasterly for salary
Fiends dream of stabbing me, Bo Diggity is never snagging me
Chino equality for the high or low black son I'm betting on that
Seeking universal mastery
Should I put platrum plaques on my wall like a Latin art gallery
Ol'Dirty should of FUCKED Maria, my rap the barbed wire fences
Ancestors Egyptian princes, showing you a view to a kill
Giving you fatal glimpses, stacking papes like there's 10 of me
Your hootie's an obsenity, corporate at the pope
But shooting bullets with no memory

Hook:
"I gotta get mine, I gotta get cash"

Verse 2:
I need that cream split and I've seen
Enough cowboy movies to know a white man's hand shake don't mean shit
So back in 9-5 I said "Fuck a 9 to 5" I ain't John Travolta
Gun in holster, man Stayin' Alive, from New Jerz to Cali
Get my swerve, servin' silence, ultra violence
A lot of islands, avoiding niggas that's spineless
I got the lay, who's beefing this kid heartless
Harry reasons vary, shot him at the vally
Took the Jag keys from the valay, Robert Shalay
Top down drove away, pumpin' Hip Hop Hooray
I'm so full of shame, it's awful strange
Local crew conplain I'm spitting out more keys than an opera sings vocal range
Fuck playin' ceelo, half latino, Chino exquistness, the streets bizness
Never personal, shorties still in Monteros for deneros
Way past the current few, violate mine and get done like Al Sharps perms do
My rents due, gotta make that revenue
You dodge bullets like Bobby Brown on my avenue
Yellow nigga with an attitude, Tommy Hilfigure booster too
From the morph of the Martinees bitches from Catholic school
Uptown they call my Parabal, crack ho selling genitals
Trading they souls for Salindriacal capsals
My products is unhabitable, please don't feed the animals
(Why?) New Jeru is a fuckin' zoo

Hook

Verse 3:
For my peoples that's making rap fans
Downin' niggas with credit card scams,jackin' strickly Toyota land
Cruisers making moves in large proportions
Dressing like white boys, sticking up Norstoms
I done seen niggas taht go from college graduations
To illegal cannibus connection with Jamacians
Hooked up with Asians for Motor-Rola flip phone activating chips
Selling exotic dips as they occupation, do what you gotta
Bitches turn tricks like a Globetrotter
Got adults playing cops and robbers, it's hot like lava
Ghetto kids breeding Rotweilders
Selling 'em flipping grip for product no problem
Genius niggas pull 6 figure burglaries, fuck a wanted sign
They can afford plastic surgury
I'm a surviver, street scholar
Smoking a pontom leaf with pitbulls see drippin' saliva
For the mighty dollar
