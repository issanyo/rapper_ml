[Refrain]
I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
I wish I was special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep

[Verse 1]
What the hell made you think the sun rose and set in your ass
Fast I remove you from my itinerary
I tense you worry and exaggerate
Becoming jealous at the drop of a dime, wanting to kill all womankind
You are a perfect ten with the perfect tan goddess
Who could sell Evian to a drowning man, honest
Trying to stay sane walking that tight rope
I'm throwing you off the deep end you better pray shit floats
You gave me chills till your mind went Beverly Hills
Make cleverly deals, and now you think you Brooke Shields
Hated my foes, now you one of they one a day hoes
Used to search my ashtray for weed I smoked some days before
I'm crazy yo forever goin' farther than just screwin' em
Making me feel like Joseph and Mary's hoein' in Jerusalem
Abusin' em is how they wanna be treated they nosy too
Should I just slap em like Scheherazade told me to
You just a tease and you play like I'm not in your league
Capturing my mind claiming I'm your biggest fantasy
I'm unattachin', what think you can spies me
If I couldn't hear your words and only judge you by your actions
Your love is sorcery, drowning in emotion poisoning me
Unfortunately your memory is haunting me
I'm feeling pains, that I can't even describe
But if I have to bitch you fuckin buried me alive
Your love counterattacks, unrealistic terroristic acts
Like the Oklahoma Federal Building I collapse
I want her back, but I know that I can't force her
Thinkin' bout takin' my own life like Marlon Brando's daughter

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
I'm back in town, stoppin' it, makin' perogative home
She too far gone, provocative as Sharon Stone
I'm feeling crucified by the very nails I
Made and drove into myself, passed to the next guy
Phones ringin' in the middle of the night (Who's that? Nobody?)
Your whole game is getting mad sloppy
Meanwhile in my hotel lobby my hobby is removing groupies off my body
It's getting cloudy, smoggy, visibility low, foggy
Four and a half years, I screwed up once
But this ain't your first time, don't be a dummy
You got champagne tastes with fuckin beer money
Fearing bummy we had ups and downs but managed
Now the going gets rough, look how you vanished
It proves that life is a comedian like Martin Short
You standin' next to me I wanna file a missing child report
To find the girl we'd always planned we'd run away together
Pray together had a child swore we'd stay together
You had your chance shoulda been nice
Your game is deader than Vincent Price
Giving up your ass like you Heidi Fleiss
Fuck your pink cop crossing guard obsession
You're half-dresses looking like a Soul Train scramble contestant (bitch)
In my arena, should I fight or just leave her
Catch amnesia it's enough to make me catch a seizure
Catch a breather, Chino do you even need her
Should I take the three-eighty, assassinate her like Selena

[Refrain]

Yesterday I seen someone who looked just like you
She walked like you do, so I thought it was you
But then she turned around confusing me
Babyface couldn't bring no cool in me
No Love Connection channel five, no Chuck Woolery
Us growing old together is what I envision
You dealing with him, but let's not make no haste decision
The mechanism is getting rusty, you won't trust me
You claim when I blow up I'll leave you for some model tall and busty
I can't believe you placed this cock above me wrong
I know you like a book but I just cannot find what page you're on
Now you put you in the middle, your voice is just a riddle
Say you want me back then change your personality like Sybil
How hard I try, I just cry more
With no reason to live, many to die for
Now as I sit in a smoky bar the night about to end
I'm passing time with strangers but this bottle is my only friend
Across the room I see a couple with no cares at all
Hugged up kissing reminding me of us before our fall
Her eye so full of hope and passion looking at her man
The way you used to look at me when I just held your hand
You gave me vast pain, to live in the fast lane
I caught the last plane, to give you my last name
I'm caught up, my family come first, that's how I'm brought up
This tragedy's worse, than one I coulda thought up
The couple stood up, I'm feeling drugged like I took Mescaline
The couple I've been watching all the time it was her and him
