[Verse: Chino XL]
Yo, the Puerto Rican superhero, I bring fear
The Boogieman checks under his bed to see if Chino's there
End your career in more ways to tear
That water's holy
And how can I be underground when the whole world's below me?
My youngest situation was facing incarceration
But now I own more homes than an ese's conversation
[?] they've been calling me [?]
Cause I use [?] to bring back and have sex with Aaliyah
See the spirit of Selina when I fill up entire arenas
With fevered freakish Latinas screaming from they seat to the bleachers
Fiending, breathing, heaving, telling how they deepest weakness
Is how I spit it meanest and how diesel Lyric Jesus's physique is
Their only grievance, the fact that I only speak English not Spanish
But they want me as they baby's daddy in any language
Just one kiss on the cheek and the mami's fainting
I'm not a reggaeton ass nigga dancing with his nails painted
My name is famous for walking around with a razor that's edge is serrated
[?] mami, my pen game is rated sacred
Your reign is overthrown by [?]
I got so many bars that's probably why my last name is Bar-bosa
Been a story teller since [?] beat me with [?]
For standing in front of the TV during Novellas
Lyric king since 16
The only homies on your team is plastic figurines from bubble gum machines
