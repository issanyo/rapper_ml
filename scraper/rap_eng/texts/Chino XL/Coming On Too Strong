(Hook)
Have I been away too long, been away too long (pretty much)
MCs wishing I was gone, wishing I was gone (pretty much)
Am I coming on too strong, coming on too strong (pretty much)
Take two puffs and pass it on , pass it on

(Chino XL)

Now recently I been dissing in action here it is
I'm back making nigga choke like Nixon 4th periods
I'm gigantic Chinardo DiCaprio
I rock enough iceberg to sink the Titanic
But we love you nigga
Than you should of represented me sooner
I'm pulling bitches like I'm John F. Kennedy Jr
I'm on that lyrical plateau that you should be low
Aliens on Heraldo claim to be abducted by chino
Your favorite tough guy hero gangsta rappers, bitches to me
I'm rarely seen Loch Ness and Bigfoot taking picture of me
I pillages with why ya broke criminals since Indian villages
I'v been battling Robert Trout with smoke signals
I'm colossal with the Gothic gossip gospel god-will win awards
Thank XL making all things possible
Philosophical thug till I stop breathing
I'm so ahead of my time my parents are still in diapers and teething

(Hook)
Have I been away too long, been away too long (pretty much)
MCs wishing I was gone, wishing I was gone (pretty much)
Am I coming on too strong, coming on too strong (pretty much)
Take two puffs and pass it on, pass it on

(Verse 2)

I'm bringing Armageddon realize
And I hate to start this on a bad note like SWV live
But last year was interplanetary
I put rappers throught more bad relationships than Halle Berry
So I'm hardly worried, but not going gold, I can't feel
I got a vocal sickness Kevorkian wouldn't kill
Live or on tapes or reels I'm getting swolled for real
You need me in your life like Mexican girls need birth control pills
Rappers no frills and got shitted on
Pathmark mustered MCs trying to be grey poupon
Lyrically I'm in a glass house
Arresting rappers for indecent exposure cause they're so ass'd out
Jealousy thats all it is cause they're entire performance was illegitimate as Bill Cosby's daughter is
The beef and drama I'v been in you wouldn't last throught
So whats funny motherfucker I wanna laugh too
Its personal as the right to abortion how I'm doing this
And for the money like EPMD's Reunion is

(Hook)
Have I been away too long, been away too long (pretty much)
MCs wishing I was gone, wishing I was gone (pretty much)
Am I coming on too strong, coming on too strong (pretty much)
Take two puffs and pass it on, pass it on

(Verse 3)

Prepere to take a lose
Give me two mintues or two bars
I'll turn all these first rate MCs in to second thoughts
Scott Pippen second best
Disadvantaged as a one legged man at an ass kicking contest
You shine like Kirk Franklin curl
Till I walk in, I hate em like Jamiroquai, he done stick a fork in em
I'm making loot solo now mos def
My old niggas mad as hell like when Jazzy Jeff sees Will Smith
I call you sissy face at cause they all going to laugh at you
I rock colorful raps like I'm Erykah Badu
Puff a Black & Mild switch from silver to gold
Shoot up your arms and legs
Till one of your members is missing like in vogue
I make you scream too (Two) plus "Know What You Did Last Summer"
I make niggas nerves like finding out Eazy-E once fucked their baby mamma
My shoes you can't fit em chino still a penny with a hole in it
Ya can't do shit with em

(Hook)
Have I been away too long, been away too long (pretty much)
MCs wishing I was gone, wishing I was gone (pretty much)
Am I coming on too strong, coming on too strong (pretty much)
Take two puffs and pass it on, pass it on
