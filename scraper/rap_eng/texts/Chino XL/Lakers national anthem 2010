(Intro)
Hey What up Felli. Knock out. Yo Like I say, Ray J, L.A stand up. Yeah west coast

RAY J -Chorus:
We goin' party till the early morn
When the Lakers bring the trophy home
We got that California purple gold
And F them Laker Haters cuz we down with the greatest

ICE CUBE:
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off 'em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep 'em chuckin' and coughin'
Off that California purple, that Laker Purple in the air
C’mon everybody, Paul Pierce need his wheelchair
3rd year, still there, this will be my third
My style's like Magic Johnson, yours is like, Larry Bird
Overrated nerd, but this ain’t the 80′s man
We got Ron Artest, don’t you know, he’s a crazy man
Defense all crazy man! This ain’t no lazy man!
All up in your jersey like the ghost of James Worthy
You ain’t worthy to hold up that championship trophy
Rollin' down Figueroa on the bus with Kobe
Don’t ask my ring size, you already know it
I got a drawer full I might as well throw it
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin' be sweet to watch the Lakers repeat
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat

Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep em' chunkin' and coughin'
Off that California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Chino XL and Roscoe Umali]
Chino XL:
The Lakers are magnificent
Critics better admit it
We winning, shoot it, pivot
With less than a second left and it swishes
Don’t test us, you know how vicious
Artest is, leavin' the Celtics cryin'
Like Lebron when the Magic gave em that ass whippin'
Lake Show you know we down for the kill
Score numbers greater than gallons lost in that BP oil spill
Paul’s pie gets pierced by the king of the kings
Rondo’s obsessed like Schmegal with the Lord of the Rings
His name was Kobe

Roscoe Umali:
Roscoe Umali, I reppin' for the Lakers
The all time greatest, can't nobody fade us
I do it for the jersey that be hangin' from the Staples
Jabbar, West, Magic, Worthy, Chamberlain and Baylor
Fisher, Pau and Bynum got championship rings with diamonds
While the homies Ron Artest to run the defensive assignments
Bench mobbin' Odom, the Black Mamba Kobe
We parade on Figueroa with the championship trophy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 New Boyz and Ray J]
New Boyz:
We the best it's so. How you ain’t a fan by now bro?
Laker’s over there head like it Shannon Brown dunk
Anybody stepping up, we getting rid of them lanes
Say LeBron needs Verizon, he ain’t getting a ring
Play LA and it’s over for sure
Tell them Boston leprechauns that them clovers don’t work
The Lakers win another championship
That’s why we got D Fisher to keep on reelin' 'em in

Ray J
It’s gonna be down Lakers in the motherf---in house right now
Ya’ll need to stop, stop runnin' your mouth
We gone celebrate and pop bottles right now
You ain't gon' top us down

New Boyz:
Ok I’m ballin, yeah I’m ballin
Them fouls you can’t be callin’
Watch you in it girl
League my n---- we be on that Spartan
Number one and you can call in
We put that ass to bed
Buzzer shot game winnin'
Derek Fisher, Ron Artest, Kobe Bryant on they head
We call that dude the man
Catch us up in LA reppin with my Laker fans
Purple and gold, yeah we smashed 'em up and they gone
Lakers took the whole series and the rest went home

ICE CUBE:
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin be sweet to watch the Lakers
Repeat I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off 'em in the finals so often
Always on fire. Keep 'em chunkin' and coughin'

Off that California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple X4

[Lil Rob]
Check check it
Lil' Rob from San Diego but I’m down for Los Angeles
I'm down with Los Angeles, L.A. K-E-R-S
The best from the west side (Left side)
We at the Pacific to be specific
All I need the purple and gold holmes
If you don’t know, now you know holmes
Don’t act stupid, stupid
You know how we do it, when we hoop it

[Hook/Outro]
