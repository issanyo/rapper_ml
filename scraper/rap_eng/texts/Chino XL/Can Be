[Hook x2]
I know I can be
A little hard to deal with so I stay
High as I can be
To get through the day without screaming

[Verse 1]
They call me Lyrical Jesus but don't make me get evil
If I put my hands on you it won't be to heal you
Sometimes I'm hoping that this life is just a bad dream
Cause I done seen things that make a dead nigga scream
"Where you been at?"
I'm questioned by my peers
But even Shakespeare disappeared for seven years
Then returned with the greatest work that a playwrite ever did
So counting Chino out really is not a bright idea
Manuel Barbosa, meet your son
I'm half Chalino Sanchez, half Big Pun
And as a shorty they would call me Chino Action
Was 10 years old at Def Jam trying to battle Run
11 years old in a juvenile cell
Lyrically already, you couldn't tell me I wasn't LL
I never failed I'm still a hell of a writing machine
Chino raises stakes like Van Helsing

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I'm like the pope, kiss the ring
How can I be anything else with so many tendancies of a king?
I'm like a veteran from Vietnam
My mind's numb, at time my grind shock you like electricians with sweaty palms
I met Gil Scott Heron on a long flight
He said, "Brother, you the type to make writers want to go and write."
How can I leave something I do so well?
I'm tired, my eyes glowing red like jewels from Hell
The hotels, sleepless night, the need for rifle power
More parasites than you can see from top of Eiffel Tower
They say my ego put me out of history
I'm so conceited I'm jealous when people envy me
I ain't scared to die, I'm very moody
Everybody gotta go sometime like jury duty
But why try me?
Even with all them Chinese kata's who try to master you can't tie Chi
No

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yo, you know Chino from the Wake Up Show
The records, I Told U So
And Poison Pen and classic Here To Save You All
You ain't even a factor
So matter of fact I'mma mow your block down like I drive a John Deere tractor
Haters feel the threat
Cause the muscularity of Chino and an action figure's anatomically correct
Everybody likes to rattle a lion's cage
But no one wants to go in alone when his razors are displayed
Afraid of long scars, dim-witted as Chumlee on Pawn Stars
Still special like 50 Tyson's report card
All this Vicodin, Jack Daniel's and valiums
Bout it, blow them promos up, it's time to drop these albums
If I don't make it and I'm decomposing in a box
My influence lives on
I just won't be there to watch
Say, "He was the illest when he picked up that pen."
And judge me by my enemies as well as my friends
Gone
