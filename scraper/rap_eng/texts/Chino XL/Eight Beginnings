[Mystic]
Mmm... a, child (a child)
Brutally subjected to what a child should never feel
His innocence was splattered on the walls as angels surrounded him
A, child (a child)
Placed in his small hands, shards of pain and jagged pieces of hatred
He was given all the tools with which to destroy himself
But, he has not
Such is the beauty of resilience in a child who became a man
Who intricately and deliberately breaks cycles
Dismantling, everything, that hurts
Handing his children the gifts, that he was once denied
He told me he's trying to get his wings back
My love, you can't lose your wings
You simply have to remember how to use them (remember)
But, fair warning, he can and will destroy you
If you so much as threaten what he loves
He remains a partly wounded warrior, on an honorable quest for forgiveness
Shining, go, show them your heart (show them)
You are exactly, who you, should be
