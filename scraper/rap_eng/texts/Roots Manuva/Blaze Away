[Intro]
It's Morcheeba and Roots Manuva
And we are together in unity

[Verse 1: Skye Edwards]
No doubt, this life
Ready to roll left and right
We're giving it up and bringing it all to light
Can't live in the dark
Forgetting what's real without the spark
Ya better believe it's there to retrieve in you

[Hook: Skye Edwards and (Roots Manuva)]
Big love, ignite
Already in flames we're alright
Feel the fire, blaze away
(We blaze away)
Oh no, baby don't cry
Spin it around, tears will dry
With deep desire, here we stay

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]
Something pours out when I think of love
Mentally blazing away, discuss
Ransoms and randoms, scare the phantoms
With esoteric reasonings of the most high
And I, and I know
Love to share like we don't care
Inside the flames, may feel a change
Being upstanding, more outstanding
Make it to the plateau, we never let go
And we got that saving grace
No more hatred, love for the lovers
She's my one and only, I'm no phoney
Told you before, don't mess with my legacy
Let there be greatness, we can't fake this
Making the statements up to the gateway
We do it straight away because

[Refrain: Skye Edwards and Roots Manuva simultaneously]
It's only love to save us from the rut
From the rut, from the rut
It's only love to save us from the rut
From the rut, from the rut

[Verse 3: Skye Edwards]
What next, what now, live and let live, loose the cloud
Now that you're free, ya clearer to see the view
Oh me, oh my, stuck in that line all this time
You gotta step up 'cause you're now at the front of the queue

[Bridge]
We're gonna celebrate and get in time
Gonna learn to step around the jealous kind

[Pre-Chorus]
Come down, up high
They're gonna eat some humble pie
So gimme the knife, I'm sharing a slice or two

[Chorus]
Big love, ignite
Already in flames we're alright
Feel the fire, blaze away
(We blaze away)
Oh no, baby don't cry
Spin it around, tears will dry
With deep desire, here we stay
(Blaze away)

[Outro]
It's only love to save us from the rut
From the rut, from the rut
It's only love to save us from the rut
From the rut, from the rut
