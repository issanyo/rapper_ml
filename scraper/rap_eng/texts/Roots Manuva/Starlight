[Roots Manuva]
Yes, yes.. it's about that time
For the combo combine, yes
Formin easy tuxedo grooves
Well.. well.. well well well
Well well well well!
You know what?

We scribble art, herbal verbal, love dip dot
Audio cartwheels that cart
We tootin from, holy baggy bone flow ??
Man overboard, he put he trust into jazz chord
Say me? None of them betray me
Bigger endin pay me, so I
Clench my teeth and said nay
Thou shalt not cause me loss of my positivity
Of elastic band who keeps springin back
Slender kid sings for dumpling
Jump into the booth with the proof of the pain
These hand concrete owl, ten hour of sneezing
Wheezing, coughing up blood
Now I'm in the mood for peace, space and time
We sit back, relax, and recool, recline
.. and we're thinking of ..

Starlight, in her lucid skies
In her mu-sic-al, so all sublime

Yo, yo
Smack in the middle of the mayhem, we chase no checks
Thinkin we a ho, now we hide from debts
Mr. Landlord, beg you please? Hear this plea
I'll be back in three weeks with three months in advance
On some good arty flex kind sir give me a chance
Blighty new face yes? Make a toast
To the host of the picnics
These capital hearty terrifics, some of them keep it real while
We be keep it cricket, Smythe, Smith
Peppergrain width, whackin in four fours
Smackin it for six, armchair critics be yellin out fix
Even though they know we don't spar with them
So the score ain't a dream
Place a bet and be grit, from be lose or win
It's the same damn ting, just a need for space
Peace in time, we sit back relax and cool recline
And we think of..

Starlight, starlight, in the distant skies
Sending me, sending message on starlight

We's feelin the season, that type of season where it
Sit watchin breeze and, we on the backroad
In the high ?? cap, where we distress the stress
Digital funk max modes for protest
On some ill and gully horseback, whole damn mix tight
Some of them stay fair yes de mess of dem'll run for they life
Mamma time tales no lies
Diggin for treasure when it were right before my eyes
Dead end streets dem, we keepin men to mice
Pur-chase telescopes and watch the skies
Surveryin revealed, all types of healing
We love to know, so we dance on the ceiling
She sassy material, as she send nuff waves to my aerial
Make me nuff, Mueslix for cereal
And she put me in the mood for space, peace and time
We sit back relax, and recool recline
Yes, because of starlight.. yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
