[Hook x2]
Man I take man talk for you
Man I take man talk for bro
Man I take man talk for love
But it's true them never know

[Verse 1]
We on some good time, peace talk
Holding the fort
Recognize the original walk
We really can't grudge no man, and yes
We really can't judge no man, and yes
Divine is the light, divine is the vision
Bringing us to those ital decisions
Stand up and we shall be counted
From where we get to get the good thing mounted
Rebel youth with that brick in our hand
Fire blazing, ready to burn Baby-land (Babylon)
Bringing back a new fertility
Change the scene with the rebel virility yes

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Kissing my teeth in the face of the non-belief
Maneuver deep with swollen feet now keep trotting
Do my best to get there, there's no regret here
Big things we set here
Sufferers, strugglers, in-betweenies
Jugglers, hustlers, listen me keenly;
Define definition of 'self' and go through
Divine definition of self. It's on you
Full time and get hip to the spirit
Full time we do the dip to the spirit
Holy ghosting big toast we toasting
Making the most and blessedly approaching

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Man are swept, don't pet, man a get it on
Man are set, bigger sets, threat will be born
If and no buts's nah go gwan klutzy
Big heart, brave heart, ever to be gutsy
Use initiative, yes you're the pioneer
Never stoosh, we're fly gone with Ryanair
Sleazy jet now, bargain bucket when
We offer you ten to get a little spends

[Hook x6]
