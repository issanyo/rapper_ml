[Verse 1/Hook 1]
Love, love for sale
Advertizing young love
Love for sale (mm)
If you want to buy my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale

[Verse 2/Hook 2]
Who, who will buy? (yeah yeah)
Who would like to sample my, sample my supply?
Love that’s fresh and still unspoiled
Love that’s only slightly soiled
Love, young love for sale

[Chorus]
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I've been through the mill of love
Better far than they
And if you want the thrill of love
I’ve been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Anything but true love

[Jamie Piano Solo]

[Verse 3/Hook 3/Outro]
Love, love for sale
Advertizing young love, young love for sale
If you want to pay the price, for a trip to paradise
It's love, It's love for sale
Young love, young love for sale
Young love, young love, young love for sale
Young love, young love, young love for sale
