[Chorus]
Boat race (repeated)
Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh (repeated)
Yep

[Verse 1]
Elevated poetry flowers it's all flowetry
Power prepare honours to honour deep, I'm on it so
Here for hours and hours and here shedding them tears of joys
Oi Pollois of noise, not too
Got forgot to get got or get me
What did you do, you don't you don't sweat me
T for technique but fear not the passion
We smash you little half hearts
Beating you back to them

[Chorus]
Boat race (repeated)
Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh (repeated)
Yep

[Verse 2]
Holding it down, holding it down, holding it down
Men in the ground, men in the sound, men from now
We was out, from the found, in the foundery
Kicking it down, every ground, of a boundary
Shaka Shaka yes, Zulu Zulu now
Got the spirit now, they can't fool who now
Got the tool to do the must, do the get down
Got to get loud don't fear nor fret now
Tear the Tet techniques in your boat race
Hold a space I lace the bar
Par for par play the part yep
And never partly
Collect more scars than a [?]

[Chorus]
Boat race (repeated)
Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh (repeated)
Yep
