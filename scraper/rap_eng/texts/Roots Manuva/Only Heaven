[Hook]
Only Heaven can never save me
Send to a mighty angel down
Before I end up in this ground
Only Heaven can never save me
Feels like Hell out on the streets
I need you more than you need me
Only Heaven can never save me
Only Heaven can never save me

[Verse 1: Roots Manuva]
Molotov quality causing controversy
Oh, it's so odd to see
Oh, it's so novelty
So, we send love to the French
To excuse my French
I'm so spent with this hard hard currency
Currently running through my vein most rancid
Forever active
Non play acted
Race card did abuse onto my black skin
They don't wanna hear about poor me, poor me
So I [?] the lines and what the scorn did
With the twisted looking philosophical view
Here is what we gonna do with much regard to
The poet with license
The senses enlightened
Just the type to come entice things
With raw brute force
Drawn from the infinite
The raw brute force
Born of the infinite
Infinite we
Infinite free

[Hook]
Only Heaven can never save me
Send to a mighty angel down
Before I end up in this ground
Only Heaven can never save me
Feels like Hell out on the streets
I need you more than you need me
Only Heaven can never save me
Only Heaven can never save me

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]
Off one attention
Crazy with that bandwidth
We cannot stand it
We're looking for the standing
We're upstanding, but here with more standards
Their innovations they sent from the godly
Downtown filled with jazz
With my bad bill
And just because he walks with the Holy Ghost
It really don't mean he won't put a hole in those
Tough talk don't mean a heap is sick
I've seen some tough time
I've seen some mean shit now
Nowadays up keen to work the angles
The Devil works from each and every angle
And as the angle sets, it entangles
Bear in mind
That we corrupt the energy
Replenish the cheap and move more freely
Rejoicing in the voice
Rejoicing in the freedom
Rejoicing in the voice
Rejoicing in the freeness
