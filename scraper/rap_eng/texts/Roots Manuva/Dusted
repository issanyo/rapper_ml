How many ya guys say want freestyle?
There will be no blows not freestyle
This style is not free, this style is expensive alright!!
Hold tight youth

Love of self I possess, through life to death
Yigga y'all, listen it's the up front fresh
My level is seldom seen, few and far between
Them fools they couldn't douse my keen
Lean to the mean thorough-bred picky-head
Slapped in the face, trapped down I guess
Sunset to sunset, but don't sweat yet
Cool, we don't fret, while the dubs them hold we
I'm picky with precision, I've made my decision now
Death itself can't hold this down
Cause the seeds of progressed, them done get sow
My tough back broke the cane in four
Face flat to the floor but I found the strength
To commence with a brand new sense of self
Euro-zulu, comin' through
Tokyo train style, hip it to the crew

(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job

'Nuff of dem ah question my rebel-like flex
But I won't waste my breath, I'll let actions speak
Though the speak stand taller than the peak of Everest
I visualize, embrace the progress
Chin-high, puff, just a-step right to it
The choice is, there is no choice but to pursue it
Soul on the mind, mind on the soul
My struggle remains, but my inside grows

(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted)

Against the grain we shall remain, huh
Yeah, steamin' on

(super-con-duper, sub-low to sunday)

Gain enough girth, gain enough ground
Movement tight, planet-wide flight
Inner-sight set to step to the hype
Left-to-the-field now, lookin' good
Wed till this wayward bounce
Proud to announce, I'm steadfast, stuck in my way
I heed not no hearsay, I put my trust in my own perceptions
And knowledge of self

(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), good job
(Down like crumb and we dusted), get yourself into hard life, good job

The power of the inner eye, huh
That's the strength of we
Groove, world, birth to the next realm
Motions splendid, it bring quality
Now my foresight see with 'nuff clarity
Motions splendid, it bring quality
Now my foresight see with 'nuff clarity

[Repeat: x4]
Hold tight, hold tight
