[Intro]
OK y'all. The simple truth is...

[Chorus]
One thing leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing
A simple thing, money. Look at him money

[Verse 1]
Comes to my head, like it came to a head
O crack it off, look at these eggs
Poached and scrambled, my preamble
Amble's over, no Land Rover
So what the heck are you doin in Surrey?
You don't look new, you seem to ate money
How could we hate the queen, when the social
Bill seems so obscene and it helped to create the scene
That put the people where the people be here
And its also open lee here
Got the taste for the finest E here

[Chorus]
One thing leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing
A simple thing, money. Look at him money

[Verse 2]
Damn fool I am I lost my cool, o hooligan
It's where the ish began, walkers crisp ball crisp be yan
Lookin all Christian, the geezer called jesus is the leader of a gang
My gang flow do promote the holy ghost, praise his name invoke the holy ghost
When I shake my tambourine I shake that ever so keenly
My only wish is to get a lamborghini
My girlfriend loves snakeskin bikinis

[Chorus]
One thing leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing
A simple thing, money. Look at him money

One thing

Oo baby
