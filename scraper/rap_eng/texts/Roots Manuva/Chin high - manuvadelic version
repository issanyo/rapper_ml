Fuel injection on a blank page
My mental splurges and emerges from nothing
I'm the forgotten
The nude that got caught with two keys in his bottom
We don't know him, we don't owe him
Poetic justice with no poem
I study my art 'til I'm blue in the face
No time to waste, my heart's on the plate
The soul and life force dancing on the timelines
These ain't rhymes no more, they're straight sermons
For urban suburban Babylonian contours
Raw roll up raw, sounds of war
To drown out the police and their tracking device
Brings back to mind how they mack on the ice
'Cause they transmit and receive
Best know the beast will listen
Throw your glitz as they strip your assets
How vexed thou art, but you are playing a part
In your own damn demise
You money-grips need to get more wise

Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Pursue it, pursue it

My I-tal views come from this I-tal brew
Something about these struggles and the things they do
The peace-bringers, quote-key-quote singers
That ring us for nothing in this marketplace
Could be target grace, a new-tical movement
Bringing an improvement to mind and soul
Life's a bitch, we tired of the bitching
Them cheap escape routes got me here twitching
How much money must we waste 'til we see
Them self-made heroes that we make for ourself
Goodbye old me, say hello to the new
Please Lord Jesus, help me get through
Can I be a man for my baby boo
What's a grown man supposing he to do
When the world at large be scared of the truth
I got good reason to be uncouth
Like a big wide hole in the top of your roof
And I really don't got much nice to say
When day-to-day is pure bills to pay
So how am I supposed to change my ways
When this world at large seems to lead me astray

Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Pursue it, pursue it

Transfixed by an apparent
Will in the way
To seize the day
Accept us to social fray
Most remember what the media push
There goes the crooks who fiddle the books
And run scot-free 'cause money reigns supreme
In the gene of the fiends
Chemical warfare
Biological warfare
The near is never seen
Man and machine
Getting into things
While some claim road and some claim blame
Oblivious to the time that we're living in
The misled mislead
Afflicted by the greed
Government man keep fighting down the weed
While they boost up the booze, the prozac and methodone
And use the taxpayer's money to develop their clones
Misinformation
Mass sedation
Nations baited for spiritual rapings

Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Pursue it, pursue it
