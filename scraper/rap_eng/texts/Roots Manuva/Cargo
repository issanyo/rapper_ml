[Verse 1]
On a plane in a plain
Fahrenheit highly
Keep the plane keep the pain
Return shall be tidy now
Never tiring to state the case
The worst case in the first place holding space well
That’s the definition of a grown man vernacular
Back to back with the word power the sonic
Hurl the pearly white stuff covered in vomit
How sick do we get when you pay your due now
Knowledge of yourself shall stay with you
In the day when they say the dogs day is through
Can’t say that the brain never planted fruit
Old foot may well stay out of loop
But the passion will speak without speaking
Original blueprint don’t need no tweeking
Surveillance reveal power of the spirit to
Learn Jah love and hold it unequivocal

[Chorus]
We’ll be leaving here alone
Well a really easy way we go
So we’re leaving here alone, alone
Well a really easy way we go

[Verse 2]
A day in the time defined by materials
Acquire the stuff we die and we leave here
Increase the suffering of relieve here
It’s more power to the core belief here
The sloganeers and the nouveau rebel is
Trained to take the bait of big business
The global elite remain invisible
Minority rule will fuel the illusion
So I will stay blest I will stay
Dedicated to the quest I will stay
Put patience to pay I will stay
Unafraid to engage I will say
Evident to the element getting us
To the plain that maintain is getting up
From a stronghold that can’t be took down
Whole world will be ready to be shook down

[Chorus]
We’ll be leaving here alone
Well a really easy way we go
So we’re leaving here alone, alone
Well a really easy way we go
