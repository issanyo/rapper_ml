Trodding the road with no place to go
It ain't safe to know
It ain't safe to feel so
Unattached to any particular concern
But to reconfirm that we
Dare to take this
Root hard travel with perpetual babbles
Our bittersweet civiles
Similar to what the society's teaching
Society's beating the best and the worst
And it's yet another squalid verse
In the thirst and the quest and they're yet to be wretched

Such is the nature of the searcher
When you've had it up to here, and you don't wish to hurt'ya
And I've got a big list of blame
And I will call out names
And I will fuel the shame that may
Set upon society shows for generations to come
Comfortably numb from the barrel of the gun
Before we have to break this world
Before we have to shake this world
What will it take to wake this world
And hear the silent sigh, the silent cry

(Alone, alone, alone, not alone at all)

Empty vessels with a big 'ole noise
The hunger for joy, but the men stay boys
Wrapped in them ego, base releash
That you've got to use your fists and your gun to achieve
Reinforced by the glory of their beautiful screens
With beautiful scenes, and beautiful screams
So how many tears must fall
When we all play a part, and we all could do more

If you got no kind words to say
You should say nothing more at all

(Alone, alone, alone)

There we go merrily, merrily we go
Same old, same old, scenario
You took a blow now, she took a blow
Too late to fret now, too late to show

If you got no kind words to say
You should say nothing more at all

Empty vessels with a big ol' noise
Empty vessels with a big ol' noise
