[Verse 1]
Artists in the ground found an infusionary
Fought man linguistic scanter
Helpless in the entity
See the caged bird
At the bosom of the angry short fall
One f‌inds a f‌istful
All engaging
All engaging
Perfection is in that non perfection, and
I see queen, I see king, I see king, I see queen, well
None of you know my kingdomanium
Last chance to attract it
Last chance to retract it

[Chorus]
Why would you hide from yourself
Belief is here to f‌ind you
Why would you hide from yourself
Belief is here to f‌ind you

[Verse 2]
Well, I pick up my foot and do those things
Improve thyself, improve with things
I thank you for the healing in
Wings of meditation
Situation is strange to us
Stranger things are claiming us
I've been told we’ve easily
As easy as the breathing be
Not so, never so, she's been told, she's down so apart of her soul
How the hell would we let it go, how the hell would we ever know
Now and then and here and then, claim to be my bestest friend
It’s just the word she's saying it, there ain't no returning now
There ain't no returning now

[Chorus]
Why would you hide from yourself
Belief is here to f‌ind you
Why would you hide from yourself
Belief is here to f‌ind you

[Post-Chorus]
Well, I pick up my foot and do those things
Improve those, improve with things
I thank you for the healing in
Wings of meditation
Situation is strange to us
Stranger things are calling us
I've been told we've easily
As easy as the breathing be

[Outro]
