Verse 1

Mickle mingey BPM [?]
Slow blends is my friends
We transcends till when
We grooves with no end
Intense like sun-rays
Scorching down hard
Some next types of charge
Is at large
I sight the Devil
In all forms of trait
Fusing up the friction
Stirring up the hate
My Gosh!
I disagree, I never saw
Just a skin-war
I see oppressed against oppression
But this mode's oppression
Is dressed with many guise
To side-step their sights
I feel with inner eyes
Watch them paro cats, them
Now I dictate to friend:
Dem a spee, they just don't see that
Friction in waiting
Be the dislocation
In this limb that could be mighty, moving tight
I guess I'm a romantic
My plan is to defy
The nature of an eye
That's bent on me and mine

[Chorus]
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion

I grooves on with the pureness
I grace with the breeze
Could not give a damn
If a damn be to sleaze
I be just swinging this heartfelt profound
Get getting down
Though fools might shun my sound
I proceed with procedures well
Container in my hand and I'm heading to the well
I bring views for the masses to share
I fights down greed 'cos there's heaps here to spare
But, back in the days
I were full of bitterness
Seen the next man's gain
I was green and full of stress
Got to get me mine so I could mangle with my worth
If death be the tool, then cats hit the earth
Gracious Lord!
Be feels to shame
Proud for the change
Now I gets kilogram gain

(A basic procedure
How I heed ya
Alrighty
Okay.)

[Chorus]
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
Indeed -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion

[Verse 3]
I'm extending my hand to the everyday folk
Trying to slip from the grip of a living-dead float
The glimmity-glam - I've got 'nuff of them fooled
By the way I open up and prepare to be schooled
Trekking through the cess-pit
I sharps up my wit
Numbing to the pressure of an ego-trip
I'm making slick with mad energy
And mad magnitude
Wha gwan with snakes [?]
I'm yet to be clued [?]
What holds me so close to these deep sides of mine
Pre-occupation with this rootique refine
I know not
But good God, she eats out my skin
The nature of a deep side
That lies deep within
Ever be sourcing to inspire
See me like rain to a wild bush-fire
Rootique refine
Is the spine of my joint
Thy heartless have got to catch cuff to the groin

Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
Indeed -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing with some next type of motion
For real -
It's with some next type of motion
Steady flexing
With some next
Types
Of motion
Know the notion
We smooth like baby dancing lotion
Oh God!
Strings!
Trill!
Legato!
Oh right
Oh right
