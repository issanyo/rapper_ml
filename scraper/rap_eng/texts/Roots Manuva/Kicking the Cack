Yeah man
That's how we groove it's how we sway
That's how we sway it's how we groove

[Verse 1]
Contained in a universe
Residing in my inner
Magnificent view
Of cornmeal stew
And calaloo
Got me wooning on the strongbone
Totty  we loved them
Send them come
Roopapiffpum
Live wire we runnin it
Shock stun stunning it
No pun in it
You see crusties drum drumming it
Roots of the faith
Trace back to year dot
We squat up in the ritz
Then we rip it down brick by brick
Cos we’s a sick sick sick
Extension of clique
French kissing the chaos
In a parallel hell
Imploded terror
They got my future on dvd
Intriguing as it be
I don’t really wanna see
That the kind of su’um
That sound strange to me
There’s chocolate splashed on the floor
Look like voodoo
Shite somebody splashed me with doodoo

Roots mawhoda? Kickin the cack
Roots mawhoda? Kickin the cack

[Chorus]
Zibadoo etc

[Verse 2]
Known to spit roots raps
Over stripped down tracks
Travel over foreign
Get drunk and act slack
Wild as fuck
While we’s living in a pack
If it wasn’t for this hip hop shit
Would i sell crack
Can you answer my questions
Tell me how black is black
Ain’t no land in the motherland
Be takin me back
With my five GCSEs and one OND
Didn’t quite make it to university
Scratched on for how long
Scum of the scum
In the belly of the beast
Where we fight for crumb
We on the psychospiritual
Psychophenomenal
Transit
Speaker of the unsaid shit
Just a speck of dust
On the tip of god’s dick
With a dick of my own
I zone across the hemisphere
Skanking on my toe tip
Make my lip shake
Levitate
As i eat carrot cake
Educated in the cycle of life
Unicycling on tightropes
Much too much for skid valley
Look at me
Ya wee bonnie lass
Decked out in adidas
She loves me for me
‘cos she got she own cash

[Outro]
That's how we groove it's how we sway
That's how we sway it's how we groove
