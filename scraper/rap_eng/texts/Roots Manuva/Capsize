[Verse 1: Dels]
Never sleep in the belly of the beast
Living in a dream in their own﻿ fanstasy
Smothered by their mothers with a breast for a pillow
Desensitised, no minds, hello?
Can you hear me?
Its a transmission fellow
Live feed
I hope you haven't eaten do you mind me?
Projectile force for the main course
Posessed by the force deep inside thee
Hey support blazers like freshly cut grass
Another child dies - how long will this last?
Ain't nothing changed since Britain﻿ turned blue
Except more cops, more problems more shit too
Looks like we're all fucked, no lube
Cameron better steer clear of my arse
Kicked down the doors of Parliment for the truth
And have a word with the PMIR

[Hook: Joe Goddard]
Times they are so treacherous, we need to stick together
Now the knights are closing in, we need to stick together
Where is the heart and soul? We need to come together
When the youths are so damn cold we need to stick together

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]
Do they really care for the﻿ disenfranchised?
Man-child really don’t seem to learn
Got the nerve to talk about guns on the streets
When the guns come cheap from the factories
The fact to be, they don’t check those facts
Or they blame and they make scapegoats of the blacks
Or anybody else who’s fresh off the boat
Or everybody else who don’t wish to vote for the moderate Blues with designer views
The red top readership holds the clues to
Who's got the money for the PR scams
To pull the wool over the eyes of the everyday man
How many fresh faced youths will they send﻿ to war
Without clear definition of what they fighting for
So what came first the addiction or the drugs?
Modern day thuggery
Pinstripe thugs

[Hook] [x3]

I'm lost, just like you
I'm lost, just like you, you
I'm lost, just like you
I'm lost, just like you, you

I'm lost, just like you
I'm lost, just like you, you
I'm lost, just like you
I'm lost, just like you, you
I'm lost
