(Chorus)
Dah dah dah dah dah

Dreamy days, come what may, we feel no way
Theres gonna be fun and lots of laughter

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I'm just a long foot Bandito
I might take of my shoes, won't take off my socks tonight
Take a little peep under that frock tonight
But there'll be no body pop, pop tonight
You know my style; I keep it on a holy out-of-body mind blown
We in some zone
So how deep can we sow those seeds
And proceed to buck the limit?
Spinnin' in a whirlpool, essential peek
Messin' around with all those chemical rushes
When natural highs come a whole lot cheaper
Sweet Tagita got me singin', baby baby babe
I got the sudden urge to misbehave
I want to take you away from all the stresses
Buy you nice flowers and expensive dresses
You don't believe me, you think I'm cheesy!?

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I want to feel ya, I want to know ya, I want to hold ya
But at the same time situations are complex
Cause you got particulars, I got particulars
Old circles are sick of us
Cause we're walkin' down a prim-rose road
To everything and nothing
So can you picture past the honeymoon
Where you'll beat me with a wooden spoon
And you got me sleepin' on the couch
Now I'm thinkin' who's house is this?
This is my money, this is my pain
These are my drugs, This is my brain
And its never gonna be the same
Its just

(Chorus: repeat 2X)

I'm a one man power house succeeding within the scene
Son of the soil, livin' the love, livin' the dream
Whipper-snappers get jealous, it's true they don't know
About my x-amount of heart break, years of low dough
We professional, we dealin' with business
Revolution creep up, slap you on the nose bridge
Tuse's in the back room, gettin' the dosh
And these women in my black book, they all quite posh
Still I wash my own brief, wash my own socks
I'm cocksure, the horny bastard's greasy pole
Square peg in a round hole, too much show now
Some say I'm arrogant, some say I'm laid back
From a council flat payin' higher-rate tax
Who's the dad? Who's the geez? Must be me: Manuva MC
With a second LP, for all the girls I got the vitality
It's my

(Chorus: repeat 4X)
