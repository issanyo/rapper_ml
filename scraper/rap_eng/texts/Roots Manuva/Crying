[Verse 1]
Try to tell I'm paranoid
Try to tell me don't do this
Try to tell me I lost my way
Try to tell me it's foolish
Try to tell me about life itself when none of you people know me
But the life I seen been cut short
Death don't go so slowly
When you're losing life like I lose
Ain't no wonder why I'm a user
It's no excuse when I keep myself elusive
I got good juices
To keep myself exclusive
Never take it personal when I don't return your call
All the peeps in this world want favours
And I just can't do them all
Damn right that's the life I choose
If you're a friend indeed then it won't be news to you
(I'm crying for the day)

[Chorus]
Crying x16

[Verse 2]
Semi-isolation
Trying to come to my senses
With a sixth sense that don't make no sense and oh shit that's expensive
What I mean what I meant to mean is this world cannot be trusted
When I look inside my head and find it so disgusting
I speak to myself and myself say: go cause some disruption
I'm a rich man, I'm a poor man
I can't take no more man
My mind's on the floor man
I'm a man a man with a strong in my hand
Over stand, understand
It just might be wrong in my hand
Don't belong in my hand till I hand it back
Tooled up with a bottle with a handicap
Black, butt naked with a genital complex
Absorbed by getting absorbed by the context
I'm crying for the day

[Chorus]
Crying x16 (crying for the day)

[Outro]
You crying? Aww.. You're crying
