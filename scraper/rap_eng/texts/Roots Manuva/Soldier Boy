[Verse 1: Martina Topley-Bird]
If our time was right (Ooh)
If our time is right
It would have come
The [?] is you're the only one
Push on the lights and another fate
Have you seen my chance?
It might be too late
I woke up with a plan
[?] to me
What I had in my hand
Between my teeth
Cause I'm torn inside
And soft through that
Boo it all
Ready to bow

[Verse 2: Martina Topley-Bird]
Upside down
Don't wear it thin
'Till it's [?] it will begin
Through the blustering wooden cages
Cover up [?] it's contagious
Jigsaw [?] don't fit right
As [?] tight
Oh, they're cueing way too late
How I hate being late
[?]
I was told there would be, honey
Dreams that we cheat [?]
If you go down to the mix tonight

[Bridge]
Soldier boy, eyes open
You know what to do

[Verse 3: Roots Manuva]
Rolling the die
Looking for my lady
[?] in the clutch and the one called lady [?]
If [?] infected me
My world view ever stop wretchedly
Ain't nothing bigger than an [?] in life itself
I scratch, the [?] yourself
Far screwed, far step
Whose to blame?
Who put the chemicals in the food chain?
Take a whiff of my mutant breath
10 pounds of squeeze on my silicone breath
Piping dream called [?] dream
Alcohol and kick a hole in on the T.V. screen
Celebrate with a plastic gauge
Modified minds
Modified feelings with the cardboard [?], but you go no place
Talk the talk, but you don't say shit
