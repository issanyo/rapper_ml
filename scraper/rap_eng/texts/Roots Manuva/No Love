[Intro]
We're gonna do it like
We're gonna do it like we're supposed to do it

[Hook]
Don't nobody got no love for Smith
There ain't no peace, there ain't no justice
And it seem like much of a muchness
But right now I really couldn't care much less
Don't nobody got no love for Smith
There ain't no peace, there ain't no justice
And it seem like much of a muchness
But right now I really couldn't care much less

[Verse 1]
I'm the lost, the found
The good penny, the bad pound
Getting me down
That's the reason for me dancing
I shake my tush to the pictures in the music
Immune to the decadence, I found some meaning
Places I've been in, slapping the demons
Cleansing the heathens, Land's End to St. Stephen's
Rhyme with no reason, son of the fifth season
Soon as I'm on the case, soon as I'm leaving
Artisan outlaw, long-time looney
Black George Clooney, moody in the midnight
Fifteen tablets, check my prescription
I seen the shrinks and they say that I'm too pristine
I said I'm too sta-quo with a government health risk
See my todger with the luminous piss

Chorus

[Verse 2]
Wayward son of a Johnson, no Charlie, no Bronson
Steady we on some, looking to lump sum
Pull up a gumption, thanks for your function
There ain't no assumption
She said, "Me know son, please bring the lotion
For good body tou'ing with the good body motion"
Bitter or habitual
Flinging my bling-bling, this my inkling, to walk with the in-thing
Outernational ghetto hoo-rah
Big-time passion, splash the hoopla
Cigars on pushbikes, first-class flights
First-class trains, people look at me strange
They don't know my name but they know my pain
Cause I'm the dude in the corner getting steadily caned

Chorus

[Verse 3]
As the hip-hop Holy Ghost touches my spirit
I'm spiritually uplifted, that's what the spirit did
And now I'm known and I'm prone to the feeling of having a buff pocket but still wanna go stealing
Rap life, you should've taught me better
From the very first day when I very first met ya
I seen the trends, the fads and the phases
The whole host of points of view brought to the stages
The sound of "P" made me feel more conscious
Tuned up my mind to the system design, but
Those were the days, the era of yester
Now the whole scene's progressed to pimps and OGs
Now I'm the fogey kicking the bogey
With nothing in between and no place for me
Yes I'll take to the trends and split the cliches
I'm a pimpernel man, U-V-A
Defender of the soul fight and the soul decay
Cause no...
Nobody

Chorus
