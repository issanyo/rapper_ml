[Intro: Run (sample)]
We have (say what?)
A whole lot of superstars, on this stage here tonight!
We have, we have
We have, we have
We have, we have
We have, we have
We have (say what?)
A whole lot superstars, on this stage here tonight

[Verse 1: Monica]
Can't believe you would leave me this way
Feelin kinda bad from the last things we said today
Can't believe you would turn and walk away
I know we would do this again and again

[Pre-Chorus: Monica]
You say you love me, I'll come back with "I hate you"
Only takes me a day to realize I'm in love with you
You say "Oh, see ya", I'll come back with "Just stay, boy"
If you don't want my love, then I have no choice this time yeah yeah

[Chorus: Monica]
Tell me baby what to do
I ain't trippin over you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
I, I remain the same
I don't know wassup with you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine

[Verse 2: Monica]
You said you didn't mean it, that's fine
You wanna take it back cause you're havin a change of mind
Sometimes sayin' sorry won't do
And somedays I can't do without you

[Pre-Chorus: Monica]
You say you love me, I'll come back with "I hate you"
Only takes me a day to realize I'm in love with you
You say "Oh, see ya", I'll come back with "Just stay, boy"
If you don't want my love, then I have no choice this time yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me baby what to do
I ain't trippin over you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
I, I remain the same
I don't know wassup with you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
Tell me baby what to do
I ain't trippin over you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
I, I remain the same
I don't know wassup with you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Yeah, yeah
Better roast the milkman delivered this everyday on the schedule
Ain't good use in cryin' over spilled lactose when you got these vegetables
Four Food Groups ain't nothin but fo' ways to keep fo' families paid
Oprah Winfrey wa'n't lyin when she was tellin y'all silly ass bout them steaks

[Big Boi]
Yeah, so for one girl when I met you, I'mma say this, you was fine (fine)
We traveled around the block, I let you drive the 'Lac one time
Maybe your heart's at stake, some of the people 'round you actin' fake
Cut your cake up, wake up, fix ya make-up cause you gon' be straight - like that

[Hook: Monica]
Tell me baby what to do
I ain't trippin over you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
I, I remain the same
I don't know wassup with you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
Tell me baby what to do
I ain't trippin over you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
I, I remain the same
I don't know wassup with you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
Tell me baby what to do
I ain't trippin over you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
I, I remain the same
I don't know wassup with you
Any any other time
Remember I'm gone be fine
