Let the spirit move you
Let the spirit soothe you
Let the spirit know you

In this, gentlemen, most distinguished
Pepper format, linguistics
Mystic, in one's approximation
Verified we style, my formation
It's my duty to the declaration
Word-power and sound; my declaration
But don't 'body gwan to town t' get things
Man O man, I get so steady, we set things

Ordered-ly the ordered be
The tenement sent with the sword for thee
Sound clash and harassing the crew
Simply done, by the things we do
Grown men setting the trend, study the zen
Real, reveal, rewind we come again
Ever more bouncy, no need to re announce me
Try and they try but they just can't denounce we

Echelon know me
Let the spirit move you
?plus the grown me?
Let the spirit soothe you
When I raise my pen
Let the spirit know you
Then we go skit man with them

Let the spirit move you
Echelon know me
Let the spirit move you
?plus the grown me?
Let the spirit soothe you
When I raise my pen
Let the spirit know you
Then we go skit man with them
Let the spirit move you

Tantamount summon the part, the pure heart
Resourced from the first resort the word spoke
Actuality is the zone and emotion
We make the most of the cause and commotion
Akin to things we're into things, it's with
Mind and soul, with bling within, stay
True to us, we do for us
Article of that such and such
Man o man, been anoint from long time
Man o man seen the point from long time
And yes it's very necessary with we
And that necessity be
Of the upmost importancy
Applied with that urgency
The we, the us, the I and the T
Set for motion, we shall be freed

Echelon know me
Let the spirit move you
?plus the grown me?
Let the spirit soothe you
When I raise my pen
Let the spirit know you
Then we go skit man with them
Let the spirit move you (repeat through last verse)

Told them dudes I was sensitive, you ain't
Down for mine, I can sense your shit
Stick to my own I ain't one to mix
With the hoobla ra ra, or the poli-tricks
Friends come and go, but we hip unto the causes
Reason or statch, my definition of the Lord is:

The strength that break the shackle and chain
The strength that break the shackle in the bane

Let the spirit move you
Let the spirit soothe you
Let the spirit know you

Echelon know me
Let the spirit move you
?plus the grown me?
Let the spirit soothe you
When I raise my pen
Let the spirit know you
Then we go skit man with them
Let the spirit move you
