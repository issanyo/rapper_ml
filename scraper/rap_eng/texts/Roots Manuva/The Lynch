Diggin deep into the low budget
Halftime
We find
Diamonds in the rough
We rough them up and watch them glisten
Yeah
Yeahyayyy
Chicken thigh
Ya know
Chicken thigh

My ill piece cosmic commentator
Niche innovator
Of this hard left
Something like a treble cleft
Turning over cobble like a back street chef
Don’t you be mistaken is it odd dub for G
Or go get them bricks or we can meet down blackheath
Bringing the set, bringing the decks, bringing the plastic
We can crash on a one or way
Play for play
To see who make the crowd bubble
It’s pure trouble and trauma
Weak hearts keep trying their love
Sector few we central get rough we get bruised
Left them walking open just they string they vest and shoes
It was on the choice
You chose to come and test
Braised all your steaks now ain’t jack shite left
Now you’re in the know you’ll be best to head the warning and learn
You mess with them pickies and you shall get burnt
That’s a fact with a 10 grand trap

We hang a sound guy
We hang him up high
Nurse starts fi check ‘im, an we see the end cry
Shoulda never test
Shoulda never try
Did he na walk on tha
I consider why

We hang a sound guy
We hang him up high
Nurse starts fi check ‘im an we see the end cry
Did he not walk on tha
I consider why
Shoulda never test
Shoulda never try

Ain’t no stigma attached
Unashamed
That's the proud posse
Cruff cycle dudutuff
From the cuff
The script
Ya know that it’s conclusive
With the response from weak heart we flex
Stay abusive
We are the original soul g
Born to defend that belief with a vigour
Carrot juice nigga
Born to deliver
On type the boogy proof croof
From the heart the soul
It’s not socialite more like socialist
Shack up wrack up
Raggamatic twist tell me
Why the hell you wan fi run up ya gums
A criss tings we bring when Manuva come
And ain’t no blaggin or braggin
That stuff work miracles
Geez get them tapes and in two weeks they fly like aeroplanes
We should be full of ourselves
Got these roots fi applies to the science that defines
Frontline full time
Diggin them trenches I sharpen my senses
Sound of war drum
For 10 miles around you hear that supersonic off (?)
We stamp on weak hearts with size 12 foot
We are
Bloodthirsty
Showing no mercy
Needle hits the plate
Town boys emigrate cos they just can’t handle
Shame and disgrace
Who be those brays trynn’a hold they face
Trynn’a hold back the tears
Who”s grip ah we fear
Beggin for a bly but they dun get ill
Contract is written an we gone for the kill
Contract is written and we gone

(chorus) x2
We hang a sound guy
We hang him up high
Nurse starts fi check him and we see the end, cry
Did he not walk corner
I consider why
Shoulda never test
Shoulda never try

We hang a sound guy
We hang him up high
Did he not walk corner
I consider why
Shoulda never test
Shoulda never try
Should never test, yeah…
