Taskmaster burst the bionic zit-splitter
Breakneck speeds we drown ten pints of bitter
We lean all day and some say that ain't productive
Could that depend upon the demon that you're stuck with
Cause right now, I see clearer than most
I sit here contented with this cheese on toast
I feel the pain of a third world famine
Segue, we count them blessings and keep jamming
Tis him - scumbag, scum of the earth, his worth was nil
Until he gained the skill of tongues
From fifteen years young straight to my greyback self
I stay top shelf material, jerk chicken, jerk fish
Breakaway slave, bliss
Generate Gs and then we stash 'em in the Swiss
Fools can't see this, audio pistols
A fistful of hip hop dons, I progression in the flesh
Esoteric quotes, most frightening
Duppy took a hold of my hand while I was writing
Let go me ting, duppy, let go me hand
I summon up the power of Banana Klan

[Hook]
Witness the fitness
The Cruffiton liveth
One hope, one quest
(Repeat x4)

Swigging that deep root juice, now we deh pon a boost
Set them spirit dem loose, go head go slash up the noose
With conclusive proof about the truth, the right
Cause whether we hitch hike or push bike or travel kind of trash
Manifest that with wholesome roots rap
Manifest that, yeah!
I do my zing way, ain't nothing else I know
Gone up in the life with this here rag-and-bone flow
Squeeze the pain from my belly and set my soul free
Travel over ocean, land and sea
Face nuff stress and difficulty
Flung back from the brink, gwan in kinda stink
We don't give a frig about what dem fools think
Frig your network, our dett work will speak for itself
Proof of the trophy and the champion belt
Come sun, come rain, come hailstone pelt

[Hook]

Bwana see me with some old time shit
Let the whole world know we's on some off-key tip
Mega-manic when time the pressure start lick
By the hook or by the crook, by the poop or by the kick
He's sickly cryptic, spitting the code
And most proud to present that Cruffiton mode
And it shows that the bro's done seen a few sleights
Life throws scenarios, reality bites
We in collision with the beast
Lost we religion now we can't get no peace
Idiot weakhearts want fe take I for chief
Stoop to their level and we plotting cold grief
But we should know that discipline maketh the geez
Separation of the DAT from the rap, that's a must
Proceed set speed with the Cruffiton touch
Proceed set speed..Cruffiton, y'all

[Hook]
