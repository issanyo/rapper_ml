[Verse 1]
By any means necessary
We do the necessary
Cause what is necessary
Is necessary
My sweet only monster face
Delightful toffee, I know your face

Crash landing no man standing
Can't believe what I just put my hand in
A little blood a little brain a little how come
No seat belt  How to be how dumb
Fantastic speeds on the runway
Wrong place wrong time in a long way
Can't breath can't see mind groggy
Last memory seems so jolly
Split seconds compress my lifetime
Men and machinery hand me a lifeline
I don't want these machines in my blood stream
Pure steel now I;m floating through my blood stream
Out for the count coma to coma
Alien amongst my own persona
The tracking device of real heavy metal types
The tracking device of real heavy metal life

[Chorus]
Please help me
Oh no
Oh no no

[Verse 2]
A paranoid place is not a real place
But who's to say when the words won't say
Emotional tipping points
The sticking points in a one way path
Don't look back forward march
It starts to end that ends the start of it
Lucid playing a page and a part
A stain on a heart a strain on afar
Flashing back to me not quite actually
Why in the world would a logic be merciful
Worst of all we sit here nothing appears or appears to win
The teaching here in an empty hand
The void in the space in an empty plan
Altogether from no man wants to be stuck in the sweetness the love of the monster breathes

[Chorus]
My sweet only monster face
Delightful toffee, I know your face
Please help me
Please help me
Oh no
Oh no no

[Verse 3]
Crash landing
Papers handing me
Still alive it just seems impossible
To see them chop and cut my body
Out of body and I see many bodies
Kinda feels like time has frozen
The cousin of death don't seem so lonely
Sweet poison calling me closer
The gift and the curse the choose's onus

My sweet only monster face
Delightful toffee, I know your face
My sweet only monster face
Delightful toffee, I know your face
