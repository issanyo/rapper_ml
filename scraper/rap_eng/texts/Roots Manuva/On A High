[Hook]
We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us
We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us

[Verse 1]
Nothing shall come between us
You can be on Mars I can be on Venus
A snab at the tip and we kill all demons
Cos we're the ceilings set to growth in the universe
First and foremost twins in the flame
Twins in the name the [?]ying and the yang go[?]
Big bang out of here everywhere always
All made in the hands of love
But most people can't handle us
They quick to judge, things they don't know about
We took the vow and nothing can move it
We searched for help but the help was useless
And nowadays we just keep it simple
Can't waste energy trying to convince whom
Speak with goodwill but really badmine
So hard trying to find good friends of mine

[Hook]
We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us
We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us

[Verse 2]
Soul on ice we know each other in other ways
Making us come for days
Laughing and giggling
Overgrown kicks in a blissed out state of no turning back
I turn white you turn black
Mismatch but perfect ready to do service
Addicted to marrying no baggage we carrying
Carrying your things is carrying my things
Being too far down the road to recovery
You cover me I cover you
Never gonna let you die but if we decide
Then we do it side by side
Tears in the eyes knowing we'll be back here again
Out of this plane into the next
No wham bam thank you ma'am but cheap sex
We're on a high

[Hook]
We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us
We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us

[Bridge]
Don't it feel so good to you
You are me I am you
Don't it feel so good to you

[Hook]
We're on a high and we don't need nothing but us
Just us, just us
We're on a high and we don't need nothing but us
Just us, just us

We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us
We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us

We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us
We're on a high and we don't need a thing but us just us just us
