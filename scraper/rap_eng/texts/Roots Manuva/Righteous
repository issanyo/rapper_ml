[Verse 1: Ocean Wisdom]
They say Wizzy are you crazy
Ambitious and so lazy
With the work rate through the roof
I'm a doobie that's true to save me
Google and news they pay me (?)
Them man they all evade me
But once evasive maneuvers they deduce (?) I'm moving gracefully

Still I'm all fired up, feeling all free
Yanchi one blessed (?) the rhythm and roots
Country don't blessed the rhythm you're weak (?)
Country don't blessed the rhythm you're weak (?)
Like who are you, ooh hoo
I ain't got time for a fruit loop
Remember when I didn't have money for the bus
Now Wizzy pulling up in a new coupe
Like uh huh and I got P
And I got Hannah Montanas on D
And I got bangers and bangers for the streets
If they want to beef me on the rhythm all week
Better pump up, tone up
(?) on the beat
Cause as it stands right now up against Wizzy and the best man couldn't compete
Mmmm you ain't got skill like that
You ain't never gonna end up on the bill like that
You got a girlfriend and crown you got a bill like that
You can't pop like me you weren't built like that
I said Mmmm you ain't got skill like that
You ain't never gonna end up on the bill like that
You got a girlfriend and crown you got a bill like that
I can't pop like you I weren't built like that

[Chorus]
Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
Anyway anyhow, them man are foul, so us man are...
Like them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
Anytime of the day, when I rhyme for the place
And the crowd say
Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
But if a man wanna bar, hold that to the (?)
Throw it back like
Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
They can't bring it to the righteous
They can't bring it to the

[Verse 2: Rodney P]
Okay, you dun know me
Been here for a while now you dun know P
Them boy didn't wanna carry this weight but I tell them slow down let's wait and see
Like hold on, hold this torch
Don't play with it you don't wanna get scorched
Them boy try live a righteous life but the ting round here gets a little debauched
Like sex, drugs, know how that goes
Hip hop kids don't we know about hoes
Real MCs with the know about flows
And we're real rudeboys so we know about roads
Like hey prick, give me that shit
You don't wanna lose no teeth
Yes I'm a duppy riddim killer from the LDN
Come ride to the righteous beat
And we sing like

[Chorus]
Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
Anyway anyhow, them man are foul, so us man are...
Like them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
Anytime of the day, when I rhyme for the place
And the crowd say
Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
But if a man wanna bar, hold that to the (?)
Throw it back like
Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
They can't bring it to the righteous
They can't bring it to the

[Verse 3: Roots Manuva]
Them boy there there there
They ain't got no shares
They are not prepared
There's something they should hear
Headtop on them squid
Nothing we should fear
But we still crush them fear
Take them out of here
Living in the right way
Man a man the foresight way
Wisdom and the Ocean
Deep for D the pure potion (?)
Rodney P the foundation
To raise up a nation
We got that station that stays where we're staying
And billing where we're billing (?)
Cause we're chilling when we're chilling and
Waves instilling them
Wake them up we're gonna get them up
Set them up with these MCs
Keep them in their frequency
Keep down with that (?) and say

[Chorus]
Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)

Them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)

Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)

Oi them boy there there there there there there there can't bring it to the (the righteous)
