I'm inna

[Verse 1]
There were trendy wannabes staring in my face
As I stepped to the place I could taste their glare
Tall hair, small hair, nuff shapes of hair
Swinging out blabber with the coin to spare
Me myself, I only got five quid to spend
And once I've broken this note my pockets on a bend
Supping on a brew so my vibe gets stirred
Feeling kind of brave as my vision is blurred
Skeets in the place, they blow my mind
I rehearse my approach and I picks my time
Second thoughts at last would distress my night
So I was just content with them sight
It were me on my jack jones, lone getting down
Freaking to the sound as the bass bins pound
I'm inna..

[Verse 2]
Cotching at the bar side, taking in the view
Press luck, trying to scrounge me a next pint of brew
It's not my relevant spot, see I know nobody
So I assume the role of some tender somebody
To attract the attention of some cat with some dough
Be it Jane or Flo', I'm slick with god flow
Looking down at my feet, 'tender' written cross my face
Hoping that some skeet aids my case
Twenty minutes pass and I gets no joy
I brainstormed in a gear for my plan deployed
It was a skeet behind the bar, almost dark as me
Needed a drink so her dream lover had to be me
I said 'Hon, I love the way you work that square
I know you's a ten and you got nice hair'
I blew she two kisses, two tries and I misses
Third time lucky, I'm hitting the target
She's warming to my vibe, looking deep into my eyes
I'm spewing out lies but she's none the wiser
Said 'I can't find my bredren with my twenty pound note
I'm feeling kind of hoarse in the throat'
She steps to the brew tap, pumps me a brew
I said 'Hon, I really don't expect this of you'
Pushed the brew to my hand and I grips it tight
Turns her back and I slips out of sight
I'm inna..

[Verse 3]
Back in the midst of them sweaty boogie folk
Some cat comes up and tries to sell me some smoke
I said 'What you got, weed or hash?' He said 'Hash'
I said 'I don't smoke that but I'll take a quick blast'
It was a potent cocktail, this hash and brew
I flips, acting like I'm not known to do
Strips down to my waist, I was feeling hot
Getting wild sensations from my head to my...
In a drunken stupor, sweating on this skeet
The company of us cats, they didn't want to keep
Then in came my bartender friend and two bouncers
Accusing me of theft, Lord knows I should've left
But this buzz in me was like grinning up my jaw
Before I knew shite I were flat 'pon the floor
Inna, man..
