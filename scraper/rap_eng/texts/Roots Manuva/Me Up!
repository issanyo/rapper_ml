[Chorus]
She opened me up
She opened me up
She roll me like some weed now she smoking me whole
She opened me up
She opened me up
She hold me like some weed now she smoking me whole
Started from a simple task, started from a simple word
Could've never learned a simple task, wasn't made for such a her her
Lost in the daily haze of so so
Closure to able feelings
Suddenly truly supposed to not to
Be sucked away by all these feelings

[Verse 1]
Feelings up in the feelings so right inside incite connect to my side off
Vibration here, sanctified inclination so clearly
Didn't want to hear me nearly gave in
Ego games they claimed to cave in
Peoples bout to say the same thing
Ain't nothing in this world that came to save him
But wine and soul and spirit with the freeness
Can't get between us just can't redeem this here's where to feel this proper whole
Chemistry will come and take it so
Nothing in this universe is on hold so
Whatever we do for love
Bouncing groove we do for love
Bouncing groove it's sprucing up

[Chorus]
She opened me up
She opened me up
She roll me like some weed now she smoking me whole
She opened me up
She opened me up
She roll me like some weed now she smoking me whole

[Verse 2]
More ground over standing it, understanding here and they're tying them off
More to get with the basic joy for
The simple things that come to pass
8 billion chances in the process
Lost focus pulling the point of view
Great learning seems to point to whom
Who knows it fills a place to dance
Up against it ready to take the jump
The final pilot comes from out the blue
No surprises hearing it all to do
All but seize the power of the moment
Keep holding on to the atonement
Condolence for the afterlife
Four sense known as half a life
Do you want to live for a thousand years

Thought I found my exit, but found my faith again (I found my way)
Face to face with the sacred hearing the space again
(I found that space again)
Thought I found my exit, but found my faith again (I found my way)
Face to face with the sacred hearing the space again
Here in the space

[Chorus]
She opened me up
She opened me up
She hold me like some weed now she smoking me whole
She opened me up
She opened me up
She roll me like some weed now she smoking me whole

Thought I found my exit, but found my faith again
