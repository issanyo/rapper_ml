Lord Gosh now

[Verse 1: Roots Manuva]
Rebel eye with fortitude
Come see the dude exude
The rudiment cement baptism
No arguments 'cause I know the blokes who terminate
They do it for the joy they don't need no papes
While I count the shillings
Best know there's many willing
To drill out the laws till the nonsense pauses
Down for the essence of rebel-eye causes
With synchronisity, goat-skin paraphrase
Mystic maze of sonic mathematics
The acrobatics on a tightrope
That near broke the spine
Time for time, line for line
Random as the windchime
Deep sublime
Risen above
Written in dub
Dubwise
Pomme-frites or french fries
International passion of whom?
New life in the womb

[Chorus: Roots Manuva]
Have you ever known a haunting of this kind?
From to and fro, the railroad of one's mind
Have you ever known a haunting of this kind?
From to and fro, the railroad of one's mind

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]
When I hold my pen
Done told my pen
Talk the talk of the lion's den
Come again
Come see me, in the clouds
Singing it loud, saying it proud
This title survival go back back the Bible
With some old thing, new thing, a you-and-a-who? thing
You don't want none
But you might get it
Jump right down and watch the man who met it
Holy thing, slowly hymn from thingamy
Don't you start kidding me
We'se deadly serious
Nobody want to share with us

[Chorus.]

[Verse 3: Roots Manuva]
I'm lost
I'm lost
In the stream of so-called
Consciousness
The random thought
The random splurge
That upsurges through the centre
Of the mind's inner page
The rage inside
The rage inside
The stage inside
The eye of the tigger
That turns to tiger
