[Verse 1]
Fuel injection on a blank page: my mental splurges and emerges from nuttin'
I'm the forgotten
The nude that got caught with two keys in his bottom
We don't know him, we don't owe him
Poetic justice with no poem
I study my art 'til I'm blue in the face
No time to waste, my heart's on a plate
The soul and life force dancing on the timelines
These ain't rhymes no more, they're straight sermons
For urban, suburban Babylonian contours
Raw raw roll up raw, songs of war
To drown out the po-lice and they tracking device
Brehs better mind how they mangle their ice
'Cause they transmit and receive
Best know the beast will listen
Know they'll glisten as they strip your assets
How vexed thou art, but you are playing a part
In your own damn demise - you money-grips need to get more wise

[Chorus]
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Chin high, puffed chest, we step right to it
The choice is there ain't no choice but to pursue it
Pursue it, pursue it

[Verse 2]
My ital views come from this ital brew
Something about these struggles and the things they do
The peace-bringers, quote-key-quote singers
Dead ringers for nothing in this marketplace
Could we target grace? A new-tical movement
Bringing improvement to mind and soul
Life's a bitch, we tired of the bitching
Them cheap escape routes got me here twitching
How much money must we waste 'til we see
Them self-made hells that we make for ourself
Goodbye old me, say hello to the new
Please Lord Jesus, help me get through
Can I be a man for my baby boo
What's a grown man supposedly to do
When the world at large be scared of the truth
I got good reason to be uncouth
Like a big wide hole in the top of your roof
And I really don't got much nice to say
When day-to-day is pure bills to pay
So how am I supposed to change my ways
When this world at large seems to lead me astray?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Transfixed by an apparent
Will and a way
To seize the day
Accept us to social fray
Most aware of what the media push
There goes the crooks who fiddle the books and
Run scot-free 'cause money reigns supreme
In the gene of the fiends
Chemical warfare
Biological warfare
That is never seen
Man and machine
Getting into things while
Some claim road and some claim blame
Oblivious to the time that we're living in
The misled mislead
Afflicted by the greed
Government man keep fighting down the weed
While they boost up the booze, the Prozac and methadone
Use the taxpayer's money to develop they clones
Misinformation
Mass sedation
Nations baited for spiritual rapings

[Chorus  x 2]
