[Chorus]
Again and again and again, we come fi improve ya
(Oh hear we, oh hear we!)
Again and again and again, we bust a big groove Manuva
(Lord!)

[Verse 1: Manuva]
A lot of people don't know about Smith
How I came to the scene, and came to uplift!
Eradicatory sanctions of righteousness
Pentecostal son, coming from the heartlands
With every breath and every noun
We dare not stop burning Babylon down
With every penny, every pound
Reflective of the rebel heart and the rebel sound
Dedication to dem life and dem causes
I did dem tours and settled those scores now
I'm back at the drawing board
And I'm sketching out two plans with two crystal balls
I see the future and the culture looks corroded
Lose that chap, man. But them dudes are just posers
I don't know where to show this
So I'm about to bring that back
Whether we chant, rap or sing that back
It go

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Manuva]
Anytime we chant that ting, you know we rap that ting!
We just might clap that ting, but
We ain't on some boasting about
We gotta make moves, no loafing about!
He ain't got no clout, she ain't got no clout
Still they wanna come here, come run up their mouth!
They wanna know what Manuva's about:
Check my catalogue, you'll see with no doubt!
We don't sell out, but we sell a tune or two
Beaten by a wooden spoon or two
But the pain that break me is the pain that make me
And the pain that take me is the pain that help me maintain
Life ting in the frame you know
We're straight kicking the bin â€“ it go
I don't know where the soul is
So I'm about to bring that back
Whether we chant, rap or sing that back
It go

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: ? ]
Food? Well
And clothes? Well
His style? Well
His skin? well
His shoes? well
Manuv's? And well
Well, baby, yeah baby
Oh yes, Roots Manuva, the talk of the town
So watch all the people ?sending come fi yuh the run?
Fi anywhere we go, we have the man and control
Roots Manuva is the star of the show
You know-oh

[Chorus x4]
