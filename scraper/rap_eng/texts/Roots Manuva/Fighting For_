[Intro]

[Hook]
Uuh-uh, sometimes
It feels like fighting for
Wasting away fighting for
Uuh-uh, sometimes
When it feels like fighting for
Wasting away fighting for

[Verse 1]
Should’a been could’a been ain’t so why bother with
No time to tolerate the constants of horridness
Dressed as a friend as nice as they come
Knives shall be plunged deep into the flesh
Of them that were happy to least expect it
Blood may well be thicker than water
But war will arrive with no word of warning
Angels of the morning, demons in the noon
Ever consumed by beating off the gloom
There in the moment, faced with the truth
Just ain’t gonna know what’s the right thing to do
The life of the little, the life of the great deal
Life taking life, death making space for life
Vein fights of, vein flights of
Hands are tied, sick and damn tired
The cold truth makes room for the warm lies

[Hook]
Uuh-uh, sometimes
It feels like fighting for
Wasting away fighting for
Uuh-uh, sometimes
When it feels like fighting for
Wasting away fighting for
Uuh-uh, fighting for

[Verse 2]
Choosing the right, battle recognising the foe
At the end of the road that leads to a road from
Out of the blows, no news is bad news
Accustomed to assume in the payments of dues
From right where you stand, that brings out the upper hand
Peace makes the man, but the ego runs riot
Step into the light, remaining in the darkness
Fortune lanes pertaining to the heartless
It may seem like a viable option
Fire against fire is a strange concoction
Karmic justice will reign supreme
Routines in life cause a loss of belief, we’re
Regaining that, reframing that
New name for that, new lane to bat
Greater steps for all creed and kind
With movements of this Devine decide it’s

[Hook]
Uuh-uh, sometimes (It’s those moments)
It feels like fighting for
Wasting away fighting for
Uuh-uh, sometimes (when we open our eyes and recognize)
When it feels like fighting for
Wasting away fighting for

[Outro]
