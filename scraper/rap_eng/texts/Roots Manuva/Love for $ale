[Verse 1/Hook 1]
Love, love for sale
Advertizing young love
Love for sale (mm)
If you want to buy my wares
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale

[Verse 2/Hook 2]
Who, who will buy?
Who would like to sample my, sample my supply?
Love that’s fresh and still unspoiled
Love that’s only slightly soiled
Love, young love for sale

[Chorus]
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way
I've been through the mill of love
Better far than they
If you want the thrill of love
I’ve been through the mill of love
Old love, new love
Anything but true love

[Verse 3/Hook 3]
Love, young love for sale (mm)
Advertizing young love, young love for sale
If you want to pay the price, for a trip to paradise
It's love, It's love for sale

[Roots Manuva Solo]
Taskmaster give me that real uncut love
Fly the dove higher than high, and never come down
Willing and ready to stick that neck out
Situation gets sticky now, we get the heck out
All grown up now with a feeling for the deepness
Restless looking for a brand new outlook
Paradise without, paradise within
The devil's design is enticing things
He without sin may frown on us
Keep still man take it to the ground and such
It's nobody's business to be in your business
You can have it all just put it on your wishlist
All becomes fair in love and war
Less becomes more, more becomes less
When you fight for your right to do for love
Ain't a thing that we won't do for love
Short-time, Part-time, dancing on the timeline
Fight definition with the ultimate position of
Kamasutra suit yourself, pick up the love gun shoot yourself
Feels so good to wanna die for love
Whatever the reason what type of love
Quick love, slow love, never gonna know love
Shame on you, we can make our own
Second to none and count me out none
Beat your chest cause yous a love champion!


[Hook 3/Outro]
If you want to pay the price, for a trip to paradise
It's love, it's love for sale
Young love for sale
Young love, young love for sale
Young love, young love, young love for sale
Young love, young love for sale
Young love, young love for sale
Young love, for sale
