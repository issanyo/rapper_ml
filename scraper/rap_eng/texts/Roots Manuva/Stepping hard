[Verse 1]
Got to keep stepping hard
Got to keep stepping hard
Move by the mountain never seen a mountain move
But look at what the mountain do
Mole hill or mountain what be you
Situations amounting stopping you
Reaching for the top so we gotta be careful
It's so beautiful and I'm so tearful
Weeping at the mountain what are we here for
Just a minor morsel looking at the portal
I caught you looking at my speck of dusting
Disgusting because I'm always in a rush thing
Can I ever be more like the mountain do
With the mounting dew to be here for way much more
Than I could ever think of living cause when I think of living in my heart I'm kidding
Slow death kidding myself yet to die
Way much more than I'm yet to live

[Chorus]
It may seem like there’s no respite
It may seem like there’s no respite
Stepping hard
Stepping hard
Got to keep stepping hard
Got to keep stepping hard

[Verse 2]
My tongue do speak for the meek bring in meat bring in veg
Word said
Feeding the head with a pledge for the get go never let go
Holding on to the cause like rebels with no cause like
Most annoyed bringing the joy, with the joy yes we do rejoice
In this true born spirit of rap we never hold back chat that motivates black to do the cock
Take the plot thick with that holy ghost got from the cock pit fly over the moon with do do
Truly with the bride that's R in the July
Grace most given and the fort amazing
Wavelength made and it shall be done
Stand back and await the abundance come
Stand back and await the abundance come
Stand back and await the abundance come

[Chorus]
It may seem like there’s no respite
It may seem like there’s no respite
Stepping hard
Stepping hard
Got to keep stepping hard
Got to keep stepping hard

[Verse 3]
Let the heart beat beat
Perpetually
Inside that deep
Sweet lady
Let the heart beat beat
Perpetually
Inside that deep
Sweet lady
Let the heart beat beat
Perpetually
Inside that deep
Sweet lady
(It may seem like there’s no respite)
Let the heart beat beat
Perpetually
Inside that deep
Sweet lady
(It may seem like there’s no respite)
Let the heart beat beat
Perpetually
Inside that deep
Sweet lady
(It may seem like there’s no...)
Let the heart beat beat
Perpetually
Inside that deep
Sweet lady
Stepping hard
Stepping hard
Stepping hard
