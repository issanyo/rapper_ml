Its the low-slung well-hung 'bout to get this
Better for that nuns * bringing the wetness
We get reckless, pee on the setlist
Triple latex 'cos we gotta protect this
Nark side, dark side, something to spark side
Spoonful of cyanide, do you know that guy?
I don't know nutt'n man, I'm cooling my sutt'n man
Viable glutton man, don't push my button man
Magnified needs, magnified greed
Desperate, 'cos we got seed to feed
Now, we don't want no war things, let's explore things
With the peace and the reasoning, we could get more things
It's so simple but we just can't work this
Way too much hurt and too much conflict
Seems to burn my bones these days
Got a big old yearn to stay home these days

Chosen, living my life like it's golden
I'm rolling, spinning my dice like I'm bowling
Supposing, tip of my toe tips, a grown thing
Inspired, walking a bit more like Moses
The road is mean as it was then from way back
Frig the Government, you tell 'em that I say that
I'm aimed at, phoney MPs and house friggers
Pussyhole token skoons and head figures
Obligatory ragamuff rag enuff manic
I'm mangling, strangling, him or her
That choose to concur that the works ain't relevant
I'm telling 'em, spelling it out in plain English
From nineteen ninety four, when a man's been in this
Before before that, when shit was worse
So what if I choose to kick up and curse
Expose the torture, expose the hurt
