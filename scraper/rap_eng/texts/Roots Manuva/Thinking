Roots Manuva - Thinking
I can’t see what they want from Smith
I am a man of my own mind I`m life in a beat
With many of eyes (?), more pony (?) more tits
I downed a crook and I act like a twit (?)
Could it be that I need some councelling?
Could it be no one will amount to him
There`s too much truth when if I hav’ got the urge to sing
More soul more sin am reflect within
Am an lonely soldier, only with more composure
I told ya about my next motion title
Some for you to hate, some for you to like
Some for you to love, my tears are full of blood
Think about you think about me
Think about this think about that
I am dangerously thinking
Thinking about me sitting here thinking
Think about you think about me
Think about this think about that
I am dangerously thinking
Thinking about me sitting here thinking
Thirty year’s old and I never had a job
Who`s that lay-about professional slob
Cooling in my yardy in corner on the club
Look me and spread to come squeeze my knob
Social crouching big time yob
Unintellectual sexual slob
All that I have is my balls and my slang
I could get dirty and dig for? duties
Most unrudy,? to yours truly
Roots Manuva remove you’re whiteness
Lyrical curtness, got enough frauds
At home and abroad
I`m most on toward
Think about you think about me
Think about this think about that
I am dangerously thinking
Thinking about me setting here thinking
Think about you think about me
Think about this think about that
I am dangerously thinking
Thinking about me sitting here thinking
The scorn grows and it shows in my eyes
The truth and the lies, the demon a wise
Solution in the sun set and the sun rise
Revolution itself the time is nil
I´m the hippie I am the gangster the contradiction
The plastic dick that needs to be fixed with some good piece of pony
To cool my vein, pray for me mummy help me maintain
Hip to the poly trip? up in the chain of
Crazy commission and those who don’t listen
And those who don’t care and don’t who don’t fair
My god how could it be that the learn come to terms with my misery
And still be me and still be free and no?
