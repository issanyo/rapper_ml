Well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well

Taskmaster burst the bionic zit splitter
Breakneck speed we drown ten pints of bitter
We lean all day and some say that ain't productive
But that depends upon the demon that you're stuck with

'Cos right now, I see clearer than most
I sit here contented with this cheese on toast
I feel the pain of a third world famine, segue
We count them blessings and keep jamming 'tis him

Scumbag, scum of the earth his worth was nil
Until he gained the skill of tongues
From 15 years young straight to my gray back self
I stay top shelf material

Jerk chicken, jerk fish
Break away slave bliss
Generate G's and then we stash them in the Swiss
Fools can't see this

Audio pistols a fistful of hip hop donzai progressin' in the flesh
Esoteric quotes most frightening
Duppy took hold of my hand while I was writing
Let go me ting Duppy, let go me hand
I summon up the power of banana clan

Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest

Swigging that deep root juice, now we deh 'pon it boost
Set them spirit them loose, go 'head go slash up the noose
With conclusive proof of both the truth the right
'Cos whether we hitch hike or push bike or travel kinda trash

Manifest that with wholesome roots rap
Manifest that yeah, I do my zing way
Ain't nutten else I know, gone up in the life
With this I-ragged born flow

Squeeze the pain from my belly and set my soul free
Travel over ocean land and sea faced nuff stress and difficulty
Flung back from the brink gwan'ing kind of stink
We don't give a frig about what them fools think

Frig your network our dett work will speak for itself
Proof of the trophy
And the champion belt
Come sun come rain come hailstone pelt

Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest

Yeah Bwana Simit with some old time shit
Let the whole world know, we on some off key tip mega manic
When time the pressure start lick by the hook or by the crook
By the poop or by the kick

He's sickly cryptic spitting the code
And most proud to present that cruffatin mode
And it shows that they bro's done seen a few sleights
Life throws scenarios reality bites

We in collision with the beast
Lost we religion and we can't get no peace
Idiot weak heart want to take I for chief
Stoop to their level and we plotting cold grief

But we should know that discipline maketh the geez
Separation of the dat from the rat that's a must
Proceed set speed with the cruffatin touch
Proceed set, speed crufatin yow

Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
Witness the fitness, the cruffatin liveth, one hope, one quest
One quest
