(Instrumental intro)
If I could only make you understand
Then I might make this place a perfect land
But there's too much, too soon, too little
Too late (repeat)

Some people call me Rodney
Some people call me Roots
That's that bloke that knows today's crews
But that's alright I back at crews
He world of Nike trainers and the world of nice suits
Expensive wrist watches, expensive groves

In the vent that I DON'T EARN NOTHING (HAH!)
I'm bound to sell all of these things
My bling? Yes
And rightly so
