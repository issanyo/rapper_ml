Let the spirit move you
Let the spirit soothe you
Let the spirit know you
In this, gentlemen, most distinguished
Their performance, linguistics
Mystic, in one's approximation
But I find we style, my formation
Its my new, eternal declaration
Glory, power and sound, the decoration
But don't 'body gwan to town t' get things
Man O man, I get so steady, we set things
Audibly we oughta be
The tenement said: "give the sword to thee"
Down crash and harassing the crew
Simply done, by the things we do
Romance setting the trend, we study the zen
Real, reveal, with wine we come again
Ever more bouncy, no need to re announce me
Dying and crying but they just can't denounce me
Let the spirit move you
Let the spirit soothe you
Let the spirit know you
Tantamount summon the court of pure heat
Resourced from the first resort the word spoke
Actuality is the zone and emotion
We make the most of the cause and commotion
Akin to things we're into things
Mind and soul, with bling within
And stay, true to us, we do for us
Articulate such and such
Man o man, been anoint for long time
Man o man seen a point for long time
This is very necessary with we
And that necessity be
Of the upmost importance see
Applied with that urgency
With the, the us, the I and the T
Take promotion, we shall be free
Let the spirit move you
Let the spirit soothe you
Let the spirit know you
Told those dudes I was sensitive
You ain't, down for mine, I can sense your shit
Stick to my own I ain't one to mix
With the hoobla ra ra, or the politics
Friends come and go, but we hip unto the causes
Reasonable stench, my definition of the Lord is:
The strength that break the shackle and the chain
The strength that break the shackle in the brain
Let the spirit move you
Let the spirit soothe you
Let the spirit know you
