This life is full of lots of learning
And when we strive
We’re sure to be concerned with
Both ups and downs
That force us to a better place
Much time we waste
Repeating their mistakes
Hurt to learn
Learn to hurt while
What makes you sigh
And cuts your eye at me
Well I’m trying my hardest
It’s the best that I can be
What makes you sigh
And cuts your eye at me
I’m trying my hardest
It’s the best that I can be
Late when you need me early
Way to straight when you need my curly
Yes no maybe blow
Can’t say when but maybe so
I’ll be your super friend
Understanding its super friendly
Clean and I’ll cut my hair
And I’ll get super trendy
The more I try to please u
You seem to find the need to
Huff and puff those hissy fits
Point and shout those finger clicks
And ah, everything I do
You always seem to redo
So I may as well do
What I normally do
What makes you sigh
And cuts your eye at me
Well I’m trying my hardest
It’s the best that I can be
X3
And if the time shall come
For us to be one
Oh nation
Let’s find ourselves
Some peace of mind
So we can grow the children
So whenever looks so confusin
Don’t know what to do
Walking round bookin (?) school
I’m not the one to force them back
But it seems like they’re on the attack
Most people don’t know what to do
So I say
What makes you sigh
And cuts your eye at me
Well I’m trying my hardest
It’s the best that I can be
