[Verse 1]
The R-O-D gets deep on it's something is awful as thoughtful as pain on the button it's
Full of that self discovery
Can't discover me cause the lord governs me
I know they don't like the world but I shall observe and I shall do service
Here in the pulpit to duck po po
[?] nose and the twitch is low
Get to the black let's get to the facts
The poor don't relax the poor do funky soul clap
Twisting and dap with them
Turn the G's it's black cause
We believe it's that way
Full of that no me spirit
Can't control me spirit
Can't console me spirit
Get to know me spirit
Get to grow me spirit now

[Chorus: sylas]
We're the fallen
Don't breathe out
I know you will
Don't breathe out
I know you will
Don't breathe out

[Verse 2]
No fear put it out there prepare for who unaware for the stabbed and the tearful
Me and the tearful, ever so careful
Full of the fiending revealed in the lake is hot heath
Cleavage knock out, knocking it out you know
Hide the salami, dropping it out
No go, keep flopping it out
Keep thinking of a master plan
Do for must and sure I can
Shall expand with the brand of the anti-brand
The nobody likes us, the true survivors
Only in spite of
Being the most misunderstood
Run the good bad and ugly
We keep it cuddly
Stating the [?]
Pulling the rugby
Cannot mug me
Can't out-plug me

[Chorus: sylas]
We're the fallen
Don't breathe out
I know you will
Don't breathe out
I know you will
Don't breathe out

[Verse 3]
All forgiven and I thank you Lord
Never to late to thank you Lord
Full force and a blanket for
Hold a dream and be some more
Can't escape universal law
First in line for the cause and call
Bound to make one walk one tour
Lose to win and take the fall
Keep a hold of the golden breath
Fear for nothing in life or death
Seen the scene in the pearly gates
New black Jesus we can't wait
Kiss myself and kiss the ground
Feeling most uplifted now
Me and my God need the purest love
Known to be about what pureness does

[Chorus: sylas (Manuva)]
We're the fallen
Don't breathe out
(Hold it)
I know you will
(Dancing on the flame
Don't breathe out
I know you will
(How brave is your breath?)
Don't breathe out
(Oh yeah baby it's too easy to take for granted)
I know you will
(We walk with the impossible)
Don't breathe out
