[Skit Roots Manuva]
Lard-a-mercy
We drinking snapper
'cause we feeling dirty
Oh Manuva alongside the Wildflower
Ah ha
This type of flower y'all

[Wildlower]
Blessings blessings
Yessings yessings
I'll give you want
If you give me what I need
Time to say grace
Take your place
To the human race

[Verse 1: Roots Manuva]
Yo yo it go
Ever am I jamming
My flip stay congested
Clinically tested
Certified pure
Gaining more ground than the floor
Before you knew shite
I kicked down your front door
We put drums and b-lines
And stain your inner mind
Boldly you are struck with this Rootique design
See I don't
Know no better
Than to keep my shit deep
Ticking over time till my week end my sleep
I shun the ways of all sheep-like types
When I grips mics you get pure blessed strength
Heaven sent, making heathens repent
Push your bad shit back
Here comes the baptism
Don't key nuff his instant composition [?]
And there'll be no backsliding in my church
Cos I hurt like the truth
Check my magazine
Any which way heathens must get redeemed

[Chorus: Wildflower]
Before you get the wrong idea
Here's something I got to make clear
The ex-experts with the expertise
Ain't got no place over here

[Verse 2: Wildflower]
Before you get the wrong
Start acting wrong strong
If you ever catch me dancing on a table top
In a thong, in a seedy dive
Looking sad like my stuff's gone wrong
Yeah, for now I look focussed, diligent, strong
Point is to make me warn ya
That you never know quite what's around the corner
See, if I had the gift of foresight
Wishing I could tell you, babe, that it'll be all right
But don't forget to live up in the hear and now
While you thinking 'bout the year two thou'
For the future don't be scared
Be prepared to stop chase the chattels and the vanity
Get in touch with your soul and spirituality
Before the full calamity is here, my dear
My fire's still burning like a spear
Wildflower, Roots Manuva, make it clear, make it clear

Roots Manuva: We make it blouse not clear

[Chorus: Wildflower with Roots Manuva]
Before you get the wrong idea
Here's something I got to make clear
The ex-experts with the expertise
Ain't got no place over here
Before you get the wrong idea
Here's something I got to make clear
The ex-experts with the expertise
Ain't got no place over here

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]
Over here. Over where?
I stay pensive
Keep my flex of trashion expensive
Dem A&R stay anally retentive
You tink how I step fras I just
Deal with the matter put my heart pon plate
White labels in a suitcase
Photocopies of some spiel and my black face
I'm on the corner of East Street
Yelling, rag and bones style
Greet the mans with a spud
Greet the skeets with a smile
Frig 'em all, here stands the heart, the balls
So if you truly sick and tired of the bullshite hype
Back a local man and make a stand
Sing nah
We don't wannabe, we just be
We most uncouth, we un-PC
Kick the sand in your face
The ace is mine
Travelcard in my pocket running under the Thames
Heading North of the river to collect two ends
It go...

[Chorus: Wildflower]
Before you get the wrong idea
Here's something I got to make
Something I got to
Before you get the wrong idea
Here's something I got to make clear
The ex-experts with the expertise
Ain't got no place over here
Before you get the wrong idea
Here's something I got to make clear
The ex-experts with the expertise
Ain't got no place over here
Over here
Before you get the wrong idea
Here's something I got to make clear
The ex-experts with the expertise
Ain't got no place over here
