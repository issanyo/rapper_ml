[Intro]
Mind to motion. Know the notion
Notion! Know shun, No. no - shun...

[Verse 1: Roots Manuva]
Nightime passes - sleep man in the valley
Is a discount two-penny with no vampire flock
As you can tell, I'm from a basic stock
I get vexed an' wanna beat the world with a pork chop
Off beat ... lost the key and can't find it
Representation of the spit in the grit
The devil on my shoulder keep tellin' me shit
Constantly got me feeling like I'm losin' my grip
Whats'on in my head - I tried fight back the hate
I look into the mirror - see the face of a mistake
Should I really be here, should I really exist?
Should I take these drugs? Should I get so pissed?
I dedicate this to the tippler crew
Getting drunk, playing punk on the stylophone
The zone of coasters. coastin' far
Pissin' in a bottle while drivin' in the car
Lager lout rap, do you dig my niche?
Tokin' too nuff on the pipes of peace...
Cruff-neck scout you know we bought and about
They major hope in a time o' deep doubt
We's feelin' the feelin' of knowing the feeling and
Lovin' the feeling cuz it feels so crisp...
Posse on cue they'mouf we jump an' twist
Each and every time we catch a style like this ...

[Hook]
Hither to ... bear witness. { tra la la la }
To the Birth... { tra la la la }
Of the Brute ...{ tra la la la }
And furthermore { tra la la la }
Of the brute { tra la la la }
Sing .. brute away .. { tra la la la }

[Verse 2: Roots Manuva]
Stone the Crows my hands stay giddy
I dance with hippy chicks more madder than lizzy
I could never understand all the hoorah fuss
Until my drink got spike with a spoon of moondust
Dancin' into the night - into the day!
Within my soul aboard the slow decay
Singin' yippe-yie-yeay - tribal flashback
Back to square one - sound o' Drum
The tongue of the book - the look of the crooked
Purple lord please - run come save me...
I don't wanna live until I'm dying to die
My types o' heaven is a good clean supply
Love for my tiddly-whack
Bliss for the todger. More jolly than roger
With a wad of pink notes ... singin'
One rums, two rums,three rums, four
Drink five rums and we fall on the floor

[Hook]
{tra la la la } Hither to! Bear Witness ...
The brute! {tra la la la }
The birth of the brute .. {tra la la la }
And furthermore {tra la la la }
The Brute .. shall stay .. Brutish!
Yes ... Yes ... and Furthermore ... Yes
The Brute live ... The brute love ...
The brute know ... Brute .. away ...
Brute .. ality ... Brutism .. The brute!
