UK warriors, Get down get down
???

(Riddla)

I made destinations, deadlines too
No bad reviews
The only fool with a negative view is you know who
It’s the way I word it
8 out o’ 10 cats if they preferred it
So there’s no time to sit down and screw
A classical, musical ???
What can I do? Industry attitude
Makes me wanna give in
They feeding the kids poison like Michael Bivins
Hype videos null and void without Williams
I like livin’ but British rap don’t pay
I been rappin’ since the days of Up Pompey
And in retrospect, I shoulda been a Garage DJ
To collect my cheque
Cos it just seems so effortless
Came back in ‘99 it’s like I never left
There might be eye because we still get no respect
How many Brits have been played by Funkmaster Flex?
How many Brits have been played by Sway and Tech?
Where’s my bayonet?
It seems like Brits been paying debts and
Dues for the longest stretch, yet
We still get views and the bills

UK warriors, get down get down

(Roots Manuva)

Arcadian groove
I got you in the mood with my old time pattern
My new time style
Most of them are ??? there, most of them wild
And whether it bump or not, make them want come
Disrespect, this here architect
With my higher state, ghetto-fi intellect
In every aspect that work is debt
We get down to the nitty grit
Gritty of eyeball
That cons your flow
Cos ev’rybody know, don’t
Nobody love me when their pockets is broke
But ev’rybody love me when their pockets are buff
From young my father told me
Don’t you grow to be no cruff
Guess what?
I did exactly the opposite
Nobody tell me ‘ish when I croon for my supper
Juggle my thing ting
Proper the properly
I got a beat
Which part? the totty beads
Bouncin’ they hip to the roots vibe
Disco mix, as she dip I feel my cod root twitch
And I know
That it’s about that time that I
Got to get my thing thing on (Comealong now!)
