Go! Go! Ay Z-O! Ay Ay Ayy

[Hook]
Im screaming this the one
My niggas fighting we ain't got no time to get the gun
You see these bitches all up in here better get you one
I live the life that got no limits screaming fuck these other niggas cause i'm down for my niggas this the one
My niggas fighting we ain't got no time to get the gun
You see these bitches all up in here better get you one
I live the life that got no limits screaming fuck these other niggas cause i'm down for my niggas

[Verse 1]
Pulling up, hopping all out that new shit
Fuck is up? Zombie back on his bullshit
This is us. Its The Set and we never crew switch
Bitches hear my name in the building and then they lose it fuck a hater
These strippers be too thirsty so I gotta tuck the paper
I got six hundred and nine reasons why I got my weight up
I got this money on my mind and yes I got it made up
Throw a party, do no favors yes I had to let em know
It seem like me and success is just too inseparable
Walk in the bank and the teller say my check never low
Oh yeah they know me by face so I don't have shit to show I just walk in and pin the code
Pulled up to the valet I told them niggas no pictures
Pulled up to the valet them niggas they taking pictures
Pulled up to the valet my wheels on just for attention
I get it done stuntin, nigga this is fun I told you niggas

[Hook]
Im screaming this the one
My niggas fighting we ain't got no time to get the gun

I live the life that got no limits screaming fuck these other niggas cause i'm down for my niggas this the one
My niggas fighting we ain't got no time to get the gun
You see these bitches all up in here better get you one
I live the life that got no limits screaming fuck these other niggas cause i'm down for my niggas

[Verse 2]
Pulling out, no talking i'm on some new shit
Pulling out, I dont need me no new kids
This is now I dont care what me and you did. You went your way I went my way now you gotta deal with it
Bitch i'm greater
I got six hundred and nine reasons why I got my weight up
You really had me fucked up if you thought that I would wait up
Shout out Mr. Morgan cause he made them niggas pay up. Thats the reason I am paid up bitch I had to let em know
Man don't you ask me ever again if i'm OVO. Because Im that til the death until they let me go
Man I just play my position until its time to go that's something yall never know
Bitch I live with mama but never I do the dishes
Money in the bank but never I fly out bitches. I just fly out to em available then I'll link em. Fuck em, make em cum, spend a check these niggas dumb
