All I want is money
Fame, respect, the cars, clothes, and hoes
Champagne splash, let that man get cash
All I want is money
Fame, respect, the cars, clothes, and hoes

[Verse 1]
You Looking at the future in the flesh
Cashing out five figure checks
BET award sitting on my mama desk
Chauffeured to a five star to rest
Whats next? Me
Under the influence, over the bullshit
On top of my game, layed under a new bitch
She giving me brain, and telling me new shit
She here with a friend, I ain't know she  was cool with
Since when were y'all friends, wish I woulda knew this
I'm fucking with her, so I get on some new shit
Act like I ain't know her, the other girl clueless
So shorty gets mad and then dips looking stupid
Same day that I got head from the both of them shit how do I do it?
I don't understand why I should stay the same
I don't see how I could stay the same
Nigga look around me, shit ain't the same
And neither how y'all treat me, so I ain't to blame
Ima sip my liquor, fall in the cut, yeah that's the Mike that y'all want
Man I give all day, time to give y'all the Mike that don't give a fuck
Now-a-days I gotta watch what I say and do
I got some shit on my chest, i'm gon' say it too
You a threat to the game when ya idol keep selling you game and the nigga keep playing you
But I peep game and I see shit, and i'm not with alla that secret shit
And when I gots a problem I speak on it
That's all that I got to leave you with

[Hook]

[bridge]
Fuck yo problems, i cannot help you
I could do something for you, nigga thats nothing for you
I got this on my own, so no i don't owe you
I can do something for you, nigga that's nothing for you

[Verse 2]
Ace of spades, Dom P
Nobody woulda saw this shit coming
Came  long way from the class clown, fellow graduates are now struggling
Yeah, the class clown got the last laugh man the irony of thats funny
My town don't rep me the way I rep them
But if I stop then tell me that im stunted yeah
Thats just how the shit go, thats just how niggas do
But 609 should appreciate me cause I did the impossible
You can see me posted right here like I don't do the shit I do
And i'm gon' be a legend and I know that shit
Don't say that I ain't told you
