[Verse 1]

I Cannot Fake It’s Too Much
I Think Your Consious’ Content
You’ve Given Others This Love
I Pray My Patience Don’t Fade
Ice On Your Wrist
Gone Head Lil Bae
You Earned That Shit
Can’t Tell Me Shit
That’s What She Say

[Bridge]

And She Don’t Really Know What’s Going On
She Don’t Really Know What’s Next To Come
And She’s Really Satisfied Just To Go Catch A Vibe
It Got Me Out My Mind
But She Like What The Fuck You Missin

[Hook]

Don’t Stop Don’t Stop
Aye You Make It Worth It
Damn You Do It Perfect
(Just For Me)
Don’t Stop Don’t Stop
All These Blue Faces Falling Down You Can Catch Em
(Long As You)
Don’t Stop Don’t Stop
You Make It Worth It
Damn You Do It Perfect
(Alright 5x)
(Just For Me)
Don’t Stop Don’t Stop
Just For Me
Don’t
(Stop) Stop

[Verse 2]

Don’t Stop Pop That Pussy
Who You Now
Think Bout Your Mom What Would She Say
Would She Be Proud
You Been In This Bitch Like 4 Days
Tryna Get You Out
You Think You In Here Makin Plays
Tryna X Me Out
I Just Wanna Have A Conversation
Talk You Down
No Face To Face With Them Blue Faces
Coming Down
I Don’t Think That You Should Really Play
With The Shit You Around
Swear To God I Don’t Want You In Danger
Hear Me Out

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

I Say Bite Back Bite Back I Cannot Help That I Like That
Hair Long Ass Fat You Know That’s My Type Yeah You Know You Know
What I Like What I Like Baby I Thought You Was Mine Yeah
Everytime On The Line Giving You Time Keeping Your Ass In Pocket
Begging You To Stop It Yeah Yeah
We Both Got No Options
All These Niggas Wanna Holla
Tell Me This Only For Dollars
She Just Losing Insight I’m Putting Up A Fight And I Thought It Was Obvious

[Bridge]

[Hook]
