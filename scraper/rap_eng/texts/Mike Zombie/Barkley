[Verse 1:Showmann]
Bitch Get Up Off me, Balling Like I'm Barkley
Can't Hoop For Shit but I'm Rocking in My Jordans
Polo, Gucci, Louie are my garments
Space Jams on like I'm Riding on a comet
Wake up in a Saks 5th, Fell asleep in Nordstrom
You Sexually deprived, I fuck bitches out of Boredom
Opps, I said bitches, thats kind of misogynistic
Committed to killing beats but seldomly to any women
You do that, then you a dummy, you bitter, you sucking lemons
When a woman try to play me I throw her them John Lennons
Permitted to do litte, my budget ain't really shit yet
But that will all come in time, cuz I ain't exactly rich yet

Damn, I'm feeling really self conscious
Might be the only rapper thats honest
TME, bitch we steady droppin bomb shit
Double O, in the back of my Conscious
Shawty, you can twerk, but can a nigga get a private show?
Not saying that you a ho, but I'm sayin that I'm a pro
I'mma busy guy, so when I nut I'll say I gotta go
She the type to top me off, not the one I'm taking home
Ain't no model, no role model, for my daughter
So I'm always strapped before I dive, don't know whats lurking in that water
Penny ones, Pewter, copper, had them bitches in my locker
Momma mad bout what I spent, but she happy that I got em
Had to cop em, Helicopter, cuz now I'm flyer than all em
Use to tell me get my weight up, and now they ask me to spot em
Didn't wanna Un-DS em, but fuck it I had to rock em
I started off at the bottom and ended up as a problem bitch
