Struggling to earn my keep

Drop it from my speech
Crafts My own path with
My hands and feet

Victory is mine

Found in the bible
Pick it up and read

Action speak louder than words
Man talk is cheap

Out here gettin mines
Cashing checks making moves
Dressing to impress

Yeah you boy Blessed

Cause God Promise more
Than minimum wage for me

Put in work and
Reap what you sow
Strive for nothing less
Than my best

When life gets (HARD)
Another Challenges OR Another test

Pray for heal and strengthen
And Let God handle the rest

I was Slackin
All talk no action

In the Bronx where to many
Chit chat I done with that

It's time for action

Time waits for no man
So i Make something happen

Didn't want to be
All bark and no bite
In this Life

If you dont try
DoG You anit living right
Everdays a Fought

Nothing given gotta you earn
Lessons i have Learned

Believe ill aciheve it
Speak it into the exist

Show Drive and exhibit persistence

Seeking first the Kingdom of heaven
24/7 like your local quickie market 711

Live up to your potential
Think of the possibilities

God directs the path just follow
Don't waiting for tomorrow

Life is Bliss Even thou
Im treated like the kid Everybody Hates Chris

Everything i do is legalize McDonald's
My movement franchise

Cover by divine hands
The reason ill be getting mines
