Ok Ok, I know they ain't gon' like this
I don't give a fuck
That rapper, that nigga right there got identity crisis
Ok Ok, I know they ain't gon' like this
Niggas scared to live they life, talk to 'em like this
What you doing? Who you fooling? Yeah we know, that you know, that we know the jig is up
Find a life, stick with one
What you doing? Who you fooling? Yeah we know, that you know, that we know the jig is up
Find a life, stick with one
Nigga I dare you

[Verse 1]
You sound like him, you sound like him, you sound like him
You look like him, you talk like him, you walk like him too
And I know why you hate your life, i'm glad that i  ain't you
Think its 'bout time y'all get up off that bullshit, but bullshit i'm back on it now
Tell a lame nigga, bitch nigga, whack nigga, fake nigga, fuck nigga this is where you sit ya ass down
I ain't in it for the money, bitch i'm in it for the crown
But every penny counts like my name Oscar Proud
609 savior, see the thorns on my crown
I be in my city, you ain't looking ima around
Producers in the game tryna steal a niggas style, give me bass now
My mama told me humble down, I told her that I couldn't cause it's fucking with me now
This how I get to talking when lyrics isn't written and I press the red button and I lay the shit down
This where the jig is right now, and I don't really think you could get it back now
The life that you living isn't really your style so I talk to 'em like this now
Listen up man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm on my shit, I see the Jig, I got points to prove
The life you live, the life you write, I can't compare the two
See, I live my life, I write my life, that's why I hate niggas like you
Think its 'bout time y'all get up off that bullshit,  but bullshit i'm back on it now
Man I came in the game with the flame its the same
Pussy nigga this is where you get your ass out
I be throwing up the money, they be throwing in the towel
22,365 make two hundred and fifty thousands
Ain't a producer living thats spitting fucking with me now
And that go for all you niggas right now
Producers in the game tryna steal a niggas style, give me bass now
Said Ok Ok, been doing me since '92 and they can't say the same
I swear cause my ego got me feeling hella good when you know that niggas out here tryna for the name
Look Up! thats where the jig is right now
Its obvious and clear i'm that nigga right now
The life that you living isn't really your style so I talk to 'em like this now
Listen up man
