[Verse]
They must have forgot who they fuckin' with
I'm too hot, I cooked this beat wearin' oven mitts
They sayin' I need to lose my humbleness
And make it loud and clear that I'm the one that they ain't fuckin' with
Yeah, runnin' through the city like parkour
Yeah, middle finger hangin' out the car door
Yeah, screamin' why the fuck should I obey the law for?
Wasn't satisfied with one chain, so I bought more
Woo! You niggas scared, yeah you really scared
No, this shit ain't fair, it ain't really fair
They talkin', well I don't care, I don't really care
If they ain't address it to my face, then I'm unaware (underwear)
Yeah, I see niggas and keep it brief, nigga
Pun intended, y'all niggas ain't gettin' fuckin' mentioned
Fuck a mention, I'm gettin' profit like fuck is pension?
Plain and simple, I'm gettin' money for button pressin'
Woo! This the realest shit I ever wrote
Nah I'm lying, tomorrow I'll cook up more dope
By every bar these rappers is losin' more hope
Ask me if I give a fuck, I'll tell you that I sure don't
Gettin' sick and tired of cocky thots
Just come and fuck me and save it with all the "I am nots"
You atheist when you waitin', prayin' that I'ma stop
The game all sound the fuckin' same since "Versace" dropped

[Hook]
Godspeed, nigga, godspeed
You gon' need more than that fuck shit to stop me
Godspeed, nigga, godspeed
You gon' need more than that fuck shit to stop me
Godspeed, nigga, godspeed, nigga
Godspeed, nigga, yeah
Godspeed, nigga, godspeed, nigga
Godspeed, yeah
