[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I don't go out to the clubs, and when you do see me in the club trust me, I have been payed to be there for those 30 minutes that you enjoyed with me. What I do is, I go to the studio and I just stay in the studio. So you have to understand the difference between me and you is to you this is your job. To me, this is my life. The club, thats my job. This studio, this is my life. This is what I do better than I do anything. So why wouldn't I do it all the time?

[Hook]
Wooh! Oh yeah
They think this money coming out of thin air
Bitch I'm back, on my bullshit, been on it
Your bitch back up on my dick and she been on it
Who fake? you, man this, new
Shit I'm on I'm doin' shit I ain't know I could do
I'm with the set, yes, none' less
Make it rain so I could drown the snakes that's in the grass
And I'm living, yeah
Prayin' every night that I get right tto where I'm supposed to 'fore I'm finished
Bitch you know the name, don't get twisted
Motherfucker I'm living

[Verse 1]
Out a suitcase, landing at a new place
Looking like I move weight, 609 the new thang
When you thought I couldn't do things, I go find a new way
Glad you got a new face, it's looking like a screw face
And I will come and screw bae, fuck you and your crew fake
We'll swing on you, no mood swing
You fail and I say hooray
Like it was a good thing
That's how me and my crew bang
Sippin' on this D'usse, a like a nigga new Jay
Damn, I got more hair than my ex
Look all of you right in your eyes like you gon' get this flex
I'm always down to make a hater upset
Rappers so subliminal but all my checks direct
Ok I got 'em, yeah
All these niggas wanna count my money but don't wanna count my problems
Wonder how much you'll spend on them, give a fuck how you got it

[Hook]
I'm like wooh! Oh yeah
They think this money coming out of thin air
Bitch I'm back, on my bullshit, been on it
Your bitch back up on my dick and she been on it
Who fake? you, man this, new
Shit I'm on I'm doin' shit I ain't know I could do
I'm with the set, yes, none' less
Make it rain so I could chop the snakes that's in the grass
And I'm living, yeah
Prayin' every night that I get right to where I'm supposed to 'fore I'm finished
Bitch you know the name, don't get twisted
Motherfucker I'm living

[Verse 2]
But I'm stressed though
My life is so stressful
But I'm never tripping, it was like that from the get go
I get the money, then hoes
Cause that's how you get hoes
You won't understand because you never been successful
My life is crazy, trust me
I just got bagged by Bucky
But I couldn't chill with her cause I ain't have no money
And that was motivation, fuck is a vacation?
Vacay when I get me a crib big as a plantation
Damn, for yourself how you can't do
But always feel the need to tell me how to make my moves
I swear to god, I'll even put that on my mom
I'ma cop that Lamborghini then ice out that 609
And I'll be living, yeah
Niggas think that killin' other niggas, really make 'em a real nigga
Real niggas give they niggas opportunities, so I can understand if you don't feel this nigga

[Hook]
I'm like wooh! Oh yeah
They think this money coming out of thin air

Your bitch back up on my dick and she been on it
Who fake? you, man this, new

I'm with the set, yes, none' less
Make it rain so I could chop the snakes that's in the grass
And I'm living, yeah

[Verse 3]
Let it breathe, nah, fuck that shit
Show 'em that you want this shit
All my shit is like rape
You don't know who you fuckin' with
Day after election day you all know who I'm runnin' with
If the shit is way too easy then I don't trust the shit
Been knew I was one of a kind, I been accustomed bitch
Who said I wasn't this? (Laughs)
Can't take away from who I be and are
I'm some other shit
This what god's work look like
When you uncover it?
When I stunt I treat it like lotion way I rub it in
I rubbed a couple shoulders and them fuck niggas think we friends
I'm tossing money, not the term
The term to me is really dead
Do everything and die is the goal
'Til then I'm living man
