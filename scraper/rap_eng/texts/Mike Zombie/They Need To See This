[Verse 1]
You are looking at an outcast
The time is running out that hourglass
Need every minute I can't let another pass
Like an embryo i'm in this bitch and now there ain't no turning back
I need that bass

[Hook]
I got the whip (they need to see that)
I got the bitch (they need to see that)
I came up (they need to see that)
Them niggas hating (wha? I can't believe that)

But you can tell them niggas fuck
And get your eyes wide open
Imma make sure that every single one of yall see this shit in first person
Sit back and watch, get this shit picture perfect
They need to see that
Bass

[Verse 2]
Z.O. came through in a new Bruce Wayne, nigga
Dreads hanging long like Wayne, nigga
I'm getting money why the fuck I feel ashamed nigga
This gon' be all over when it drop--rain nigga
Damn, you don't even know me, you mad at me
That lets me know you hate your whole anatomy
Fuck the cops, I condone profanity
I'm copping kicks like police brutality

I need a [?]
Some head in a secluded place
A million bucks for what I do
A million for my niggas too
These fuck niggas about my face
A Lamborghini in my name
My name in every fucking thing
For you to look how far I came

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah, everything you got you ain't gotta tell them
I ain't into stuntin' but I'm about to get familiar
This shit is only gonna get realer

You can believe that, but look..

[Hook]
I got the whip (they need to see that)
I got the bitch (they need to see that)
I came up (they need to see that)
Them niggas hating (wha? I can't believe that)

But you can tell them niggas fuck
And get your eyes wide open
Imma make sure that every single one of yall see this shit in first person
Sit back and watch, get this shit picture perfect
They need to say that

[Verse 3]
I be like Pharrell with my famous
Walk up to the [?] like, "nigga what your name is?"
All my friends say I might tell them boys [?]
I'm thinking to myself like "Should i know that ain't gonna change shit"

Damn, thought I was the man
Clearly I was wrong and nobody understands
Cause going to the Grammys doesn't mean you get a pass
No it doesn't, so don't tell me go and tell them who I am

That's why I be getting drunk
I never gave a fuck
I've been known to get my payback and
I've been known to keep a grudge
I can't think of a worse feeling than no one knowing who you was
That shit get me on [?]
That shit gets me hotter than Satan's nuts nigga

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah, everything you got you ain't gotta tell them
I ain't into stuntin but I'm about to get familiar
This shit is only gonna get realer

You can believe that, but look..
