[Intro]

(Humming)
Runners on the track

[Hook]

Started off at Burbank now we're here
Started running slow and now the whole team running fast
We're the underdogs of the year
Coming for the title so you better think fast
Started off at Burbank now we're here
Started running slow and now the whole team running fast
We're the underdogs of the year
Coming for the title so you better think fast

[Verse 1]

I done kept it real with every stride
Walking to my practice 'cause I never got a ride
We were-we were trying to run it on our own
'Til coach called it off, said to go back home
And Vahe calling me like, "where you at?
No one's here at practice need to get them to the track?"
He just-he just needs to calm down when it's time
Need to get that slut away, can't think of other rhymes 'cause we

[Hook]

Started off at Burbank now we're here
Started running slow and now the whole team running fast
We're the underdogs of the year
Coming for the title so you better think fast
Started off at Burbank now we're here
Started running slow and now the whole team running fast
We're the underdogs of the year
Coming for the title so you better think fast

[Verse 2]

They say "it's a rebuilding year"
Say the team's not strong, no front runners, yeah we doubt it
We got frosh soph guys moving up
The glass was half empty now it's a full cup
Stood on the sidelines for too long
So hungry for a chance that I put it in a song
To remind ourselves that we're not jerks
We stand with C.H.A.M.P.'s 'cause we put in the work

We're the underdogs of the year
Coming for the title so you better think fast
Started off at Burbank now we're here
Started running slow and now the whole team running fast
We're the underdogs of the year
Coming for the title so you better think fast

[Verse 3]

So what if Shai and Brennan left the team
So what if things went wrong senior year cross country
With the coaches gone now it's time to heal
To rebuild renovate work until you kill it
Together 'cause my soldiers weren't listening to orders
I tried to lead guess I should've tried harder
Tape's for the state but this track is for my dogs
Past all the drama hope we still get along 'cause we

We're the underdogs of the year
Coming for the title so you better think fast
