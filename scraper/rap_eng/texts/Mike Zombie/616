[Hook x2]
Drunk then a motherfucker swerving
I hit my brothers up like what it's in for
They saying 616 is what the word is
Well bitches going down if you didn't know

[Verse 1:Mike Zombie]
Monday, and Tuesday a party
Wednesday, and Thursday a party
Friday and Saturday, it's a party
Oh lord, bitch its Sunday and its still gon' be a party
616 was just the crib and niggas dying to get in
And the line is to the driveway, we just piling em in
And we know they got that skrilla, $5 to get in
Hundred people in the crib, we made $500 again
Woah, 616 was weed, bottles, sex
Gary down the store got liquor store connects
And Gary use to show a nigga love
Henny for the 20, Moet bottles for the dub
616 was just that drink the squad drink until we hurl
616 was just that place you better not dare bring your girl
Ill Will roll the weed, bets believe that bitch is pearled
I'm 16 and I ain't got a care in the world, cause bitch I'm drunk

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mike Zombie]
I been here about 4 or 5 days
I don't even know the date today
Soon as you wake up, it's a bottle in your face
Or niggas take a bottle to the face
My first day at 616, bitches was naked around the crib
EJ drunk a case of Nuvo as he could get
It could be a school night, and I would still be in this bitch
I know this shit sound so crazy, i can't make up all this shit
No, things that we would do a little liquor
Fav TV got the footage on my nigga
That's when you that's shits getting retarded
When niggas in the basement eating pussy in the party
Niggas wilding, swear to God we got no rules up in this bitch
Police station 'round the corner while we doing all this shit
Sometimes be fuckin' the same bitches cause they cool with the shit
Im 17, in 616 pop my first percaset cause bitch i'm drunk
