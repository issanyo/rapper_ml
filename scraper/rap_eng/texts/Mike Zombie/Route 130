It's the most underrated in the game right now
Can't even tell you how actin' the same right now
When the Drakes and Jay-Zs now my name right now
And y'all think I'm gonna stop, nigga blow it out ya ass
This year I took 50K and then blew it out my ass
This year I made more than any teacher that had me in their class
And still ain't pay my tuition cause Zombie wasn't a grad
Now everyone's attendin' thinkin' that's when Zombie got the cash
So Full Sail University send the checks over
Cause Zombie's walkin' promotion without the diploma
I got time, I got time, 21, gettin' older
The time is mine, the time is now, y'all niggas just older
I got a bitch in the friend zone
Funny I can run that shit back all the way to the end zone
Ever since I done been home
Too many favors, way too many people
Too many know-it-alls about how to handle my income
I'm young and talented
From a place where reppin' your section became embarrasin'
Rep it until I'm masculine
Don't give a fuck right now
Cause I know only place to go is up right now
Yeah I'm fucked up right now
Liquor got the room spinnin' upside down
Niggas like, "Uh if the money's up, I'm down"
That's how it go, you comin' up, they come 'round
The thinkin' I'm a one hit wonder
I'm out to take out Yeezy, you can't tell me nothin'
The topic of 609, on top of all the discussions
How much money I'm makin' and who Mike Zombie be fuckin'
Oh yeah they talkin' but I swear there's much left to do
Niggas made up a rumor I only be eatin' vegetables
I swear to God I can't make this shit up
I wanna meet whoever makes this shit up
You creative, nigga
This what you deal with when you quote on quote make it, nigga
Cause once you think you got your spot
That's when somebody gon' come behind your ass and come and take it, nigga
You never make it, nigga, you never make it, nigga
Prince of the 609
Haters on their job, money on my mind
Little more than all the time, all I think about is my mom
Sittin' in them Hills, what the fuck you thought was gon' happen
When that boy done gotta and started snappin' all on you niggas
Tried to make sure that a nigga didn't blow
Put a little smoke in the atmosphere, just for the Borough, gon' let them know
Man these niggas ain't fuckin' with I
Hit 'em in the head, make a nigga say "Ah"
I'm halfway on and a nigga don't lie
Yeah I spit coke, come and sniff this line
I do it for them niggas locked up in them prisons
Gettin' busy cause they gotta and tryna bring them ends in
Because livin' is expensive, they ain't livin' how they pictured
What the fuck you thought was gonna happen when they caught somebody slippin'?
No it's payback cause a nigga gonna say that I ain't goin' hard
And I just lay back, thinkin' 'bout that Maybach
And it ain't gonna be long 'fore I can say that
Bitch I'm 'bout to take that out that garage
Man these niggas better stay back
Cause a nigga don't play that
Bitch I'm goin' off, uh
It's Mr. 'Bout-to-be-mad-rich
Mouth full of punchlines like I got my ass kicked
Cup full of purple, chasin' green, colors clashin'
I can walk in anywhere and be the main attraction
Uh, got bitches badder than the boy that hit the ball
Hit them off once, never hit them up, if I want the puss she'll get the call
Fuckin' with me, that's bad luck like two niggas that split the pole
Bitch it's me, Young MZ, had to say it twice to make sure that you know
Guess what? Tonight I'm gettin' drink again
Goin' back to the club in the back of the club
Drankin' all of the drank, it don't matter to us
And a special appearance is me in the buildin', the bitches surround us
The bottles  are comin', the sparklers are flyin'
No smokin' here, but I'm smokin' a black and not givin' a fuck
What, shit I'm just actin' my age
Shit, I used to have the talent but what, lackin' the name
But now I got the name, now feel like I'm packin' AK
And once I get the aim, I'ma aim that shit right at the game
