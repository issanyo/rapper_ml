[Hook]
I'm tired of waiting
Yeah, i'm getting impatient
Throne is up for the taking
Yeah, i'm getting impatient
Nigga don't down play us, yeah shit is major
Niggas don't show you no love, yeah 'til you make it
I'm tired of waiting

[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody got the message that I am conveying
Lately I been in the bank, so yeah I feel amazing
Lately I been wilding out, them tweets been getting erased
Been misbehaving, but I embrace it
Nigga have you ever popped a bottle of that aces
Maybe you too worried about who a nigga dating
You know that I do not care about where you been at
Insecurity with me is something I replaced
Can you relate?
I promise man, I rather be under than overrated
Shit I created, can't be recreated
If that ain't greatness, then what is greatness - me bitch!

[Verse 2]
Now-a-days I gotta watch the ladies that I lay with
This bitch say that she only want sex without a latex
Type of shit that make yourself ask "man is you famous?"
My life is changing, but I embrace it
Nigga please don't downplay us, cause all our shit is major
Talking shit so major that you really need to mayor
All your aspirations like a broken record player
Rather spend all my time working while all y'all celebrating
What y'all celebrating?
I promise man, I rather be under than overrated
Shit I created, can't be recreated
If that ain't greatness, then what is greatness - me bitch!
