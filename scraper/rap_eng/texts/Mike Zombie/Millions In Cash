[Hook: Mike Zombie]
What would you do?
Yeah, gotta ask though, yeah I do
Gotta ask that, yeah gotta ask though
Gotta ask, gotta ask though
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?

[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
I grew up a fuckin' screw up
I grew up off oodles of noodles, PB & J  sandwiches with the syrup
Busy gettin' rich wasn't interested in who was?
Mister softee come around, he ain't stoppin' for no one
Me Latney and Errik was probably all in your new truck
Taking all your valuables, we was looking to come up
Karma was nonexistent and we ain't give two fucks
Shit that you gotta remember, I remember
Going with my mama to the store
Asking for the toys, she said no
That's why I go hard for my youngin
So she can get anything she want
Brown paper bag, money nope
Need that tax free, fuck Uncle Samuel
Need that type of money where I'm never goin' broke
I need that type of money where I'm never goin' broke
I know, what you would do for a million cash
You would probably get out of character fast
Somebody is gonna get stabbed in the back
Is that what it takes for you to get this cash
What would you do for a trillion cash?
Probably would run up and kill my dumb ass
Kill my dumb ass, so I ask

[Hook: Mike Zombie]
What would you do?
Yeah, gotta ask that, yeah I do
Gotta ask that, yeah gotta ask though
Gotta ask, gotta ask though
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?

[Verse 2: Trev Rich]
For that million cash, I'd probably kill your dumb ass
You right, just to shed a little light
I'm lyin', but there's plenty who gon' think on that
So even in your own city watch your own back, on that
For millys we fingerfucking them triggers
And for Bennys these bitches lovin' these niggas
Especially for the figures their parents ain't never gon' see
You either fuckin' or gettin' fucked, what's it gon' be?
My hitters on deck
It's something like they cussin' at the ref how they tryna get a TEC boy
And got me feeling like Weezy
When it comes to a milly, a milly, vanilly
From city to city we stack it up to the ceiling, you feel me?
To the point the only choice is the damn doors
Money ain't everything but it got the fam through it
Cause when you get to a certain status it's hard to trust a bitch
So fuck it, I'm bringing sand to it
I'm just speaking hypothetically
You tellin' me the same niggas I bail out could try to bail on me?
Man law, when it comes to loyalty, that's a felony
I leave the club with a couple curves like the letter B
Cause in the money she trust, and in the money he trust
We wasn't born with no trust, I mean some of us fucked
But nigga come try your luck

[Hook: Mike Zombie]
What would you do?
Yeah, gotta ask though, yeah I do
Gotta ask that, yeah gotta ask though
Gotta ask, gotta ask though
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
What would you do for a million in cash?
