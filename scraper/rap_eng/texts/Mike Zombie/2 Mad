Uh I said I go bad, look at your face and you too mad
You looking like you feel some type of way aaaah nigga too bad
Uh I said I go bad, look at your crew and your crew last
You looking like you feel some type of way aaaah nigga too bad

[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
I need bottles I need service
These bitches they need purses, they need guidance
But first I need my high school, maybach curtains
Get the fuck round me if you ain't got purpose
Do everything for a reason my nigga just get a load of this
You came here early like churches, I came here late on purpose
They say I'm cocky, I deserve this no time, for conversing
I pulled up, I reversed in
Chips like lays, valet service
I'm always V.I.P. cause my shit urgent
Don't waste my time, cause yo shit worthless
This here stuntin, I hope you learning
Perfectionist, but I ain't perfect nigga

[Verse 2: Young Savage]
Look, i'm a hot nigga, no brimstone
I'm scoring hoes like a end zone
I'm super ill, might get sent home
Bring that loud out, tourettes syndrome
This is sink or swim, i'm a can swimmer
Like massage parlors, touching mad figures
I done heard your shit, you don't rap sicker
You won't cellulite you fake ass nigga
Niggas always worried about what Sav do
Watch face blue, its in a sad mood
You a ho but your girl passed cool
If I ever get her nail i'll give you mad screws
Niggas give me a verse, i'm mad rude
I done shimmy'd though worse with bad dudes
I done grew up around some prince ahkeems
Plus semis to work for fast food
Now i'm in the club with your fine ass queen
I bomb threat mean
And she want me give her that thing cause i keep a few Gs in my wyclef  jeans
Pull up to the club like we trying make scene
Homie hold the canon, now who trying to say cheese
Only thing she know is my palms ain't cheap, heard my state give me props so she tryna make beans
Niggas on the gram doing shit for the feds
Got more likes than chips, man i'm dead
Only time you let pics get to your head is if your name Quest love just stick to the bread
Man that niggas trying to stunt and lot of numbers and meet a lotta baddies
I go and grab them girls that work at H&M, now they mad i tag then I divided it from them, like
