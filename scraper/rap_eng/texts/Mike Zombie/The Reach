[Intro: Jess Glynne & (Boogie)]
My love and my touch
Up above, made with the warmth of my
My love and my touch
Up above, made with the warmth of my
My love and my touch
(From Long Beach city, like we knew that we was different)
Up above, made with the warmth of my
(Have been moving like evictions, like we do this for a living)
My love and my touch
(They ain't see it from the jump, I guess they grew into the vision)
Up above, made with the warmth of my
(So stop assuming I've been winning, I've been losing for a minute)

[Verse: Boogie]
It's crazy how they get to switchin' when the crowd out
Guess they ain't tell you all that reaching can get you fouled out
Just bow out, not even trippin', we grown
Let me man up and get in my zone
I swear your defense is pretense
I'm like you better get that prevent
I'm coming with that deep shit, I mean shit like
All this rappin in the beach shit don't ever really mean shit
It only leave you seasick, you see shit like
Wave riders and dick hoppers
Insecure, another symptom that a bitch got you, pussy
See but I don't love to flex
Just don't talk about no reach if you ain't talking bout my text
Man I went from like, no pussy to slow pussy to yo' pussy
Bitches even throw my bro pussy
It turned to like, fast pussy, to past pussy
Tryna build a future with me, didn't like that past Boogie, that's crazy
Cause they was acting like the youngin' don't exist
Holy shit, I swear my throwaway could be your only hit
Throw the pitch, I know they're pissed
Cause they don't even hit the field nigga
I see your picture, tryna filter out what's real nigga
I build with you, we just gotta find structure
And I ain't chillin' 'til my son just get comfort
Like a rupture to my rib, when the homie caught a bid
You forever in my memories, so when I do a gig
I save a space for him, whoa, like I'ma wait for him
Steer wrong and the coppers ain't had no brake for him
Whoa, to my niggas I got a place for 'em
To my niggas, I be a faith for 'em
Cause from the ruins we ascended like we knew that we was different
Kept it moving like evictions
We do this for a living, they ain't see it for the jump
I guess they grew into division
So stop assuming that I'm winning, I've been losing for a minute
But now I'm winning for forever, all that losing shit for bitches
See but now I'm in this new light
Cause you was MIA when I was only getting two likes, a true rider
I done finally got my tune right
I do this for my son like I've been beefin' with the moonlight
I done started from the bottom, just to make it to the top
I had figured out my spot once I figured out my plot
To get everything I want, I just give everything I got
Reach

[Outro: Jess Glynne]
My love and my touch
Up above, made with the warmth of my
My love and my touch
Up above, made with the warmth of my
My love and my touch
Up above, made with the warmth of my
