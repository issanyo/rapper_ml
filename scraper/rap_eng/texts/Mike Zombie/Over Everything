Zombie on the track

[Verse 1]
Damn, I just cracked another can
Spending all my life just trying to figure who I am
Only 9 years old and doing drugs to my attention span
I been fucking up so long and I was wrong so now I do it for the fam

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah family over everything, money over nothing but it helps bitch I need it all
Yeah, oh yeah. I fucked up in school
Cindy I apologize but you know your son gon' do it for the F-A-M-I-L-Y
Yeah I love y'all niggas I ain't ever lie
That's exactly why it's family over everything, money over nothing but it helps so bitch i really need it all
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Aye, first suspension was in first grade
Cursing in the class while we was watching little mermaid, aye
School i never was  so ima grab some ass and go sit in the principal's office
Phone was off the hook at home, yeah my mister retarded
Laughing at the principal like bitch who is you calling?
Teacher said I potential from the shit I was drawing
But I was drawing bad as fuck and I was just getting started
Mom ain't let me get my permit, now i'm fucking mad
Now i'm in the school bathroom about to smoke a fucking bag, yeah
East side of the school like a straight dumb-ass
And my nigga T got caught up ended up in rehab
Man we coulda got expelled , man we coulda went to jail
Cindy came up there like "Why in school" and i'm just high as hell
And ima take my ass right home and make as many beats as I can
Bitch im trying to figure out who the fuck I am
And bitch I do it for the fam

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
First and only job I had I worked at CoCo Keys
Hundred dollar checks, man what the fuck i'll need with these
That shit just wasn't for me so I took my black ass home
But I stacked a couple checks and went and bought a microphone
Then I plugged it up and started fucking up my Telephone
Stuck at 616 that airborne play at 616 im on
And they double y is not just music that's my fucking bros
I was living with and he was cooking on the stove
And I just got a tattoo, I hope that Cindy doesn't know
Andy Mill retweeted me, i think i'm about to fucking blow, no
Wrong I was, but strong i was and i know that with all i does that in no time time would tell that i would surely blow
Summer 2010 i'm twenty ten, i'm fucking bitches getting drunk
But I ain't have a job and really wasn't doing much
Making beats for nobody and they would
But, Zombie did not care cause in 3 years they would look dumb
This for the fam

[Hook]
