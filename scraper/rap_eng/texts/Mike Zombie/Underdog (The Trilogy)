[Hook]
You fuckin' with the underdog, ah-ooh
This is when the dog get loose
You fuckin' with the underdog, ah-ooh
What happen when the dog get loose?
I swear that it's over dog, for you
Hell naw they ain't got no love for you
That's what happens when you're the underdog, ah-ooh
This what happens when the dog gets loose

[Verse 1]
You ain't got no love for me my nigga
Ever meet another nigga like me my nigga?
Are you sure? little voice in my head tellin' me go off
And nigga I'm spazzin', this is where the shit gets tragic
Sick and tired of getting treated like a lower classman
Tryna get attention  persistance it's not harassment
All my shit is massive, let's get this shit to the masses
You can't even gas me, that's why I took off the ad-libs
I'm guaranteed to fail, my second language sarcastic
Praying every night cause I'm fearing to be stagnant
I was told just stay on the low cause they just want reactions
Yeah, and I be listening
Let me touch on something that's so delicate
Tired of playin' beats for boys I'm better than
I can't say I'm lovin' it, tell 'em who they fuckin' with

[Hook]
You fuckin' with the underdog, ah-ooh
This is when the dog get loose
You fuckin' with the underdog, ah-ooh
What happen when the dog get loose?
I swear that it's over dog, for you
Hell naw they ain't got no love for you
That's what happens when you're the underdog, ah-ooh
This what happens when the dog gets loose

[Verse 2]
Quarter million dollars, that's just the investments
Lookin' at my life, I never thought I'd be this blessed, shit
They said they gonna do me when they see me, so depressing
Thank god I'm not living a lie, cause that shit right there is a lie
Cause why the fuck I'm still alive?

Questioning ain't if I can rap now
Question now is who the fuck want it
Nah nigga, let's get straight to it
Y'all done woke a monster and y'all made me do it (Yeah)
Off top, this shit won't take Young Z-O mad years
Off top my shit was the best shit that dropped last year
Niggas called me for info on it boy, hell nah I ain't give it up
Blood type L, yeah loyalty the only thing that's in my blood
In traffic with the enemies, opportunity gettin' given up
Some days, swear to god, I wake up, I just wanna give it up
My neighbors know that a nigga famous and they hate it
Most the time I wish the shit I rap was all made up
My nephews and my niece always tell me that I made it
Gotta send the money to Atlanta and Decatur
Family on my back still, three years later
609 saviour, yeah I really know the mayor
Next nigga diss me, then we getting physical
We gon' come and see your mama, on my mama I ain't playin'
Bein' humble don't mean bein' pussy
Bein' humble don't mean bitin' tongues
They might get that shit a lil confused though
Must of forgot where the fuck I came from yeah
Boy I'm really cut from something different
God and satan playing tug of war with it
They say every dog gon' have his day
But the sun never come and visit y'all niggas

[Outro]
Boy I'm really cooking something different
God and satan playing tug of war with it
