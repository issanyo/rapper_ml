Zombie On The Track

[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
These bars are for you to distinguish, after class I hit the store then cop a olde english
So close to getting on and I an feel it in my fingers
Webs slanging, music wakes me cause my spider senses tingling
College just wasn't me, I wasn't suppose to go
Body skin on my teeth, I made it there and Chris knows
I say that to say this, to say this
No high school, no college. and college was the reason I had a laptop to do this
So no highschool, no college. no laptop, no laptop no music, no music, no started. the reason why y'all herd all this
They told me my beats was wack, no all of them retarded
I proved them wrong with production, but now it's time as a artist
Yeah, uh. I hate to make you look dumb twice
Beat and bars are equivalent and [?] [?] [?]
College students, I know your pain, Mike Zombie was once the same
Black and milds for breakfast and dinner, I need a fucking change
Two room apartment, rent was 950. trying to make my music noise complaints just keep on fucking with me
If i get one more, then i'm out. now the plot thickens
And my mom just lost her job and can't get no where around the city man
How the fuck we paying that tuition man
How the fuck we putting food up in that kitchen man
No i don't regret it, but i know my past
I swear to God it felt i was going no where fast

[Hook]
No i don't regret it, but i know my past
I swear to God it felt im going no where fast. x3
I said i know my past, i swear to god it felt like i was going no where fast. (you know) x5
