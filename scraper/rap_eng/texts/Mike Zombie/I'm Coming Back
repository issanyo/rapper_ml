[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
ZO, I've done a little, it look like a lot
Seems like it's getting under your skin like Icy Hot
I strip you of your story, show 'em you 'Maliah' lot
You write up stories, I'd rather get life on writer's block
They love you when you here, forget you when you gone
Parole got denied, now who gon' use the phone
Soon as I got paid, I put them lawyers on
Money down on the books 'til all my niggas coming home
Either you happy or you jealous of the things I have
Either way it's autographs or my nuts to grab
If I'm out of state it's black trucks, nigga fuck a cab
All my work is speaking for itself so I don't have to brag
Smoke a blunt with Diddy T, Rogers on the texts
None of this shit is coming and I did this shit myself
I'm getting big but never too big for my city
But smart enough and big enough to know that nobody's fucking with me

21 having a ton of fun
Every bitch I meet keep treatin' me like I'm the fucking one
I'm worried about guap not gossip
At the end every night I pull receipts up out my pocket
I got this seats with the AC and I'm ridin' in a spaceship
The words I hear the most is proud - congratulations
Please don't talk to me about your musical frustrations
Cause nigga I'm getting better, that's something I can't relate with
Checks after checks, accolades and nominations
Flew out the town to work, but why this shit feel like vacation?
Hotel, five star, top screen like GTA bitch
I set the bar so high you need a trampoline to drank bitch
Fuck the other side we reenact the segregation
Okay I OD on life, wear clothes for no occassion
Why that last bar written out look like my bank statement?
Capitalize every O and you will see I'm paid
It's the kid with the backpack
The one who can draw
The one who can dress
Design his ass off
Sound familiar, ay
If Drake the new Jay, please tell me who can fill the shoes of 'Ye
But shit who's to say? People say it's...

Trust me on this one
I've got a bad feeling)
