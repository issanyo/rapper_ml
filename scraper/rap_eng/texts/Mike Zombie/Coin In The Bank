[Intro: Dougie F + Mike Zombie]
Yeah, hey, hey
Hey, hmm, yeah
Hey

[Chorus: Dougie F]
How we livin', it's a given
Is it wrong how we do this every day
And your nigga, ain't no different
Only difference, ain't no coin in the bank
Hey, he just, here, for the, scene
He just, here, for the, cream
He don't, put up, that
But, just, talk shit

[Verse 1: Dougie F]
Delta, flights
First class to L.A., yeah
Got a bitch on my lap
She just really tryna stay there
Told her she don't play fair
She get this dick and this lean
She wanna be on the team
Catching the ball like wide receiver
Got me in the mood, yeah
Feel it on you, yeah
Don't get it confused, I'm different
Tryna bite my moves, yeah
Wanna see me lose, yeah
Shit I came through, I'm different

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Zombie]
Don't fuck for the cake
Money don't solve everything
It's all in the bank
I can withdraw everything
We can run through it all day, yeah
Don't fuck for the cake
Money don't solve everything
It's all in the bank
I can withdraw everything
We can run through it all day, yeah

[Chorus: Dougie F]
How we livin', it's a given
Is it wrong how we do this every day
And your nigga, ain't no different
Only difference, ain't no coin in the bank
Hey, he just, here, for the, scene
He just, here, for the, cream
He don't, put up, that
But, just, talk shit

[Verse 2: Dougie F]
First thing a nigga say when they see me "Young Dougie done changed up"
From the mud I done came up
Rep the squad, know the gang up
Stay down with the same bros, eating steak all my niggas A1
Bust a move about to lay one
One night vacation
With a bitch that's beigian
She ain't even gotta say nothing
Real one, not a fake one
Pray to god that she stay one
All my wishes came true with the same crew kept the shit cool
Money coming times two
How we living, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Zombie]
Don't fuck for the cake
Money don't solve everything
It's all in the bank
I can withdraw everything
We can run through it all day, yeah
Don't fuck for the cake
Money don't solve everything
It's all in the bank
I can withdraw everything
We can run through it all day, yeah

[Chorus: Dougie F]
How we livin', it's a given
Is it wrong how we do this every day
And your nigga, ain't no different
Only difference, ain't no coin in the bank
Hey, he just, here, for the, scene
He just, here, for the, cream
He don't, put up, that
But, just, talk shit
