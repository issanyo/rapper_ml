Wanna know if I am balling? Ask yo ho about me nigga
Wanna know why she keep calling? Ask yo ho about me nigga
Wanna know if i am 'bout it? Ask yo ho about me nigga
Wanna know what's in my pocket? Ask yo ho about me nigga

[Verse 2:Mike Zombie]
I'm smoking, i'm smoking, i'm smoking
I'm drinking, i'm drinking, i'm drinking
A bitch tell me she wanna fuck me, the last thing i'm doing is thinking
I swear that I miss so much pussy in college
But I make up for that everyday, i'm the man
I reserve a section in onyx
They thought I was Diddy, i'm dropping them bands
Told myself I would stop drinking last year
I just said that with some liquor in my hand
That doesn't mean you can't believe what I say
That just might mean i'm stressed once again
Bitches called me little boy my whole life, now they have no choice to call me the man
Plotting on stocks and a share of your land
Vacations a must last resort is a stand
They know, they know i'm that nigga
My head or my pockets?
I swear to God that I do not know which one is bigger
I came from the dollar so that's why I gettem
I Been too much to settle for little
I jumped off the porch had a yard in the middle
I came from the boro where I am that nigga
You name someone else and i'll give you a million
A M i don't have it so that's how I know
M-m-mob in the city while wearing all gold
They say they gon rob me well thats what was told
Please go ahead cause my brothers go
No girlfriend cause bitches is gettin me bored
Marriage is out of the question I kno
Now fuck wit my nigga and his name is kur
She do it cause I am the man and she know it
