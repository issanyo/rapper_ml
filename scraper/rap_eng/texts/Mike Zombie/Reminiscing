[Verse 1: Stevie Rizo]
Standing next to a pile of ashes left from a week ago
Lipstick stains on wine glasses
From when we made a toast

[Pre Hook: Stevie Rizo]
I never been high
High out of my mind
Not until you, you, you
Now that I'm addicted
In love with the feeling
You say you're through, through, through

[Hook: Stevie Rizo]
And now you left me here
With all these bad bad drugs
Baby you left me here
With all these bad bad drugs
And I been getting high (You left me here)
Just to reminisce, reminisce, reminisce (You left me here)
I'm still getting high, trying to reminisce (3x)

[Verse 2: Stevie Rizo]
You use to roll up (Roll up)
And I use to po
[ur up (Pour up)
Then you starting pouring
And I started pouring
And I started rolling
Then every weekend, turned into every evening
And you say you're leaving
Now I'm rolling all alone

[Pre Hook: Stevie Rizo]
[Hook: Stevie Rizo]

[Verse 3: Mike Zombie]
Now I'm just sitting here all alone
In this drivewat thinking about you (Where you at?)
Now I done never got high before
But I think I'm going try with you (Real Shit)
Now I never been high before
But I really want to ride with you
So I headed to my repitore
Cause it's no getting by with you
I asked is this ok?
She said don't worry baby
White feel like it hit my veins
Right then she went away
