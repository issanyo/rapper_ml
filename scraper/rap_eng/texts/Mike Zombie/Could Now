[Hook]

I ain't in love
It's getting scary, i don't think  a nigga could now
I'm fucking bitches every night like I should now
I'm Getting pussy while the gettin's getting good now
Whole Squad about that drama if you get wrong
No regard for your life real shit though
I"m copping these bottles like I'm a fucking new born
Yeah I'm that nigga so no one can tell me shit tho

[Verse 1]

Chris told me fuck it, nigga go talk crazy
I am Ye', reincarnated, from now on i ain't taking back shit that im saying
