Last Year I Realized That I Do Not Have To Give Out Explanations/
So This Year You Get To Have A Lot Of Fun With Your Imagination/
Shout Out To The Squada That Is The Team Zombie ZOTT Nation/
Zombie On The Track That There Just Lets You Know That Nigga I Made It/
EOTB Man My Shit Is Just Different So And Go Get It/
My Content Is Real And My Freestyles Would Probably Body Your Writtens/
I See Why They Hate Me I See Why These Local Boys Just Cannot Stand Me/
I Fall Threw Some Local Shit Then I Just Go And Fall Threw To The Grammys/ Ay
Then I Slide Through The Hood And Act Like It Ain't Happen/
I Don't Fuck With You Niggas No Time For The Dapping/
They Like All The Attention Man How Does It Feel/
Man That Shit Just Different When Yall Make It Different So Nigga Just Chill/
Shout Out To Them Boys On That Drugs Dealin Shit/
But From My Last Check I Coulda Bought Me A Brick/
If You Ain't In The Fam Give A Fuck What You're Saying/
Zombie On The Track That There Just Lets You Know That Nigga I Made It/
