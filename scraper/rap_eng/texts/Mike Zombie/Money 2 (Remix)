Nigga this the shit
Nigga this the shit
Nigga this the shit
Nigga this the shit we get money to

[Verse 1:Mike Zombie]
I hear that money knocking at the door like nino
My beats is coke and bitch I got that by the kilo
Thats why yo bitch keep checking for me like a po
I know you know cause when y'all fuck she holler Z-O
Lets get it
Fuck bitches get money is the motto still
Rappers buy that shit that i don't feel
Bitches lucky if she even get a date out me
Cause the trickin shit really for the fags forreal
Yo money come before you even get it pussy nigga
Ima go get it and type a nigga
Gotta be careful with the type of bitches i fuck now-a-days
Cause i got the type of money that attracting gold-diggers
I could lose it tomorrow
I could lose it today
I dont give a fuck though cause the hoes gonna flock it
Imma still be that nigga anyway
I need that matress thing no comfrontable
Yo loyalty man thats questionable
And nigga that's the reason i dont fuck with you
And nigga this the shit we get money to

[Bridge]

[Hook]
I went to sleep thinking money, woke up with a bitch
Said she wanna get me off, told her get me rich
I want that mansion with a ginny in the drive way
Pussy nigga still looking at me side ways
This the shit we get money to
This the shit we get money to
Nigga this the shit we get money to x5

[Verse 2: Trev Rich]
Whats money?
Money make a bitch buss it open
Good girls leave a lifetime for the a moment
Broke niggas hate you before then even know you
Everybody say they getting money nigga ima show you
Worry about the wrong shit
You on your grown shit
