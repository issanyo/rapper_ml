Started from the bottom, now we here
Started from the bottom, now the whole grade A here
Started from the bottom, now we here
Started from the bottom, now the whole BK here

[Verse 1]
Started from the bottom?
I started lower then all y'all
Phonies watch my struggle
But I could never call y'all
Who tryna eat? We got that EBT
They amazed, such a shame how I leave these beats
Mr perfecter, resurrector, foot in your rectum
Cause I kick butts to let you down talkers know what's up
I'm speaking nothing but the truth when I'm in the booth
I'm from where they don't just talk trash they down the shoot
So watch your mouth and chill with the subliminals
Leave wins minimal
Flow crazy like a happy criminal
Crooks enter the slums of the rugged raw
Done'n em, son'n em and making sure they mothers saw
Papa was a player, I'll slay Ya, the pen and the paper
Two tools that lead me to erase ya
Better pick your pace up, when stepping to me
Open eyes cause the A be something to see

[Verse 2]
Started from the bottom? No you didn't
You would have thought I was coming up out the womb
With the way that I be kicking
Radio's a puzzle and I hear there's something missing
You say rap is dead? Then I assume you didn't listen
Listen
It be the head honcho in the building
Taj Mahal flow with this crack that I be spitting
I predicted, that I would be up on this mission
And now I got your favorite artists in a fetal position
Rude boy fresh never test he be the best in the flesh
G's work like slaves with no chains on the neck
Put the pests to rest, my mix-tape no special guests
But its still hold heat, for these, streets like OE
I'm tryna be the man like a HBO flick
Perform at the garden, leave, then rake in dough quick
Haters will take a breath, when the messiah retire
Constructing 'til I'm at the roof of my empire
'Cause we
