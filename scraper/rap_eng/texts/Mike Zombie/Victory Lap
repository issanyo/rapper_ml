[Intro: Ricky Bobby]
Well Dick, here's the deal, I'm the best there is. I mean, I wake up in the morning and piss excellence, and nobody can hang with my stuff. you know I'm just a big hairy American winning machine. You ain't first, you're last!

[Hook]
Yeah this the victory lap, I'm doing my dance
I could pop a wheelie, champagne in the air
My nigga it is a wrap, the shit's unfair
I heard they competition but we don't care
Cause we won
Yeah we won, yeah we won, yeah we won
And now we get what we want
What we want, what we want, what we want
Cue the theme music

[Verse 1]
First off I'm cocky as fuck, you can't tell me
Nothing I don't already know, I can't help it
If press hit me right at the door I'm gon' tell 'em
I'm the greatest of all time, shit forever
We don't even know what it feels like to lose
Really feelin' like shit, we write the rules
You a commentator, we don't respect your views
They say they want to be like Mike, shit me too
We just in the game, we don't got no plans
Endorsements pourin' in, I'm talkin' plenty of brands
I told 'em cue the theme music, I got hella them bands
Now watch me scream fuck your team lookin' dead in the cam
Cause when them bottles get to poppin' and the cheerleaders fuckin' and confetti get blown in the air
It's gon' really change your mood, my nigga can you excuse you? see 'em, bring your trophies over here

[Hook]
Yeah this the victory lap, I'm doing my dance
I could pop a wheelie, champagne in the air
My nigga it is a wrap, the shit's unfair
I heard the competition but we don't care
Cause we won
Yeah we won, yeah we won, yeah we won
And now we get what we want
What we want, what we want, what we want
Cue the theme music

[Verse 2]
Anything beyond second don't get mentioned
If you ain't first then you last, I tried tell 'em
My demeanor so overconfident, overzealous
That's why you over there eating peanut butter and jealous
While my record looking like infinity wins
There ain't no predictions, bitch we win or we win
Why I got to tell you boys again and again
That we already won before this shit even began
And yeah I heard you got the title, well you're giving me that
Bitch I call the shots like I'm running the match
Zombie outchea balling with no salary cap
Steal your bitch and make her come sit on this victory lap
And watch these bottles get to poppin' and the champagne pourin' and the fireworks blowin' in the air
It's gon' really change your mood, my nigga you need to move, you don't see I'm bringing trophies over here?

[Hook]
Yeah this the victory lap, I'm doing my dance
I could pop a wheelie, champagne in the air
My nigga it is a wrap, the shit's unfair
I heard the competition but we don't care
Cause we won
Yeah we won, yeah we won, yeah we won
And now we get what we want
What we want, what we want, what we want
Cue the theme music
