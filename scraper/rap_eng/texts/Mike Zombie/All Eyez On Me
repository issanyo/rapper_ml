[Hook]
All Eyes On Me
I can't walk around wit all this Ice on me
I come from the Jungle tryna move out to a beach
Cuz the snakes from the grass found they way into the streets
And all eyes on me
Loyal to my niggas, give af about police
You gotta be humble just to make it out the East
Look at all them dead babies in the belly of the beast

[Verse 1]
I be gettin to the chicken and the broccoli
Prolli why these pussy niggas wanna stop me
It's Obvi
This ain't what you want don't even try me
I done seen how fast a robbery could be a homi
Can't tell you how to live but I can show you dead bodies
When we low on tree still crack the roaches roll a Zombie
Brodie poppin pills he got the plug from Mr. Cosby
Hate when he pop pills cuz he act crazy wit the niney
I come from the side in the hood is where you find me
Niggas kill ya wife and snatch ya baby like Harambe
You think this a game this shit way more like Jumanji
Pigs grab the rats and they start singing like Ashanti
It's crazy these single ladies wanna have my baby
These niggas want me to sign em
They think I'm Jay Z
They eyeing they think I made it I think I'm trying
My hometown, that's like my mother
My city dying

[Verse 2]
And you could never understand me
I jus wanna win a Grammy do it for my family
Fish tacos lasagna and shrimp scampi
Bitch I run my city and I never pulled a hammy
I don't do no E pills or pop zannys
Club full of Moeshas sippin on Brandy
All of my ex loves they can't stand me
Prolli cuz I blew up when they abandon me
Kush in my system got me faded
You held all the cards, I'm jus mad how you played it
I made Frank and I still ain't ya favorite
You still still wondering how a nigga made it
Maybe cuz the flow so outer space bitch ooouuu
You can keep the pussy gimme face bitch oouuu
Young nigga made it out the matrix
I had a dream and I'm glad I chose to chase this oouuu
