Gettin' rich
Never thought that I'd see a day like this
Now a young nigga neck bling, wrist bling
Earring, everything
Diamonds on me d-d-dancin', I guess shit changed
Gettin' rich
Never thought that I'd see a day like this
Now a young nigga neck bling, wrist bling
Earring, everything
Diamonds on me d-d-dancin', look how shit changed

[Verse 1]
Switchin' up on niggas, bustas stuck in my ways
Doppler effect on my life, shit change further you get away
The niggas stuck on broke as fuck the first to say that they paid
Now here you are still broke as fuck and all you do is complain
That's why you broke and no one helped you
Maybe if you wasn't bitchin' someone would have felt you
Oh back then it was your time and now it's time to tell you
How it's now the older niggas who I put the belt to, I'm Hell-proof
Oh yea, shit changin' up, I can see it
Yeah, shit changin' up, you ain't see it
Yeah, Zombie is next up
They told me I'm famous and now I'm believin' this shit like woah
I never wanted this shit
Fuck it, I'm up in this bitch
I'll never be done with this shit
Woo! I'm 'bout to go dumb in this bitch
Nigga we are not adjacent
Cause you niggas too complacent
Business trips is vacation
Y'all ain't hearin' what I'm sayin', hollup!
Friday just another day
It's friday for me every day
I'm changin' my name to Andr√©
Cause I spent 3 K in a day

[Hook]
Gettin' rich
Never thought that I'd see a day like this
Now a young nigga neck bling, wrist bling
Earring, everything
Diamonds on me d-d-dancin', I guess shit changed
Gettin' rich
Never thought that I'd see a day like this
Now a young nigga neck bling, wrist bling
Earring, everything
Diamonds on me d-d-dancin', look how shit changed

[Verse 2]
Ooh, got it poppin' like a rubber band
Ooh, just in case money, 'bout a couple bands
Ooh, bitches graduated look a fuckin' mess
I just did the opposite, now they say they know the kid
No, no, no, you don't know me
Man these women be so washed now I'm talkin' so clean
Pull up now, real shit, they treat me like a fuckin' trophy
And they still be with the shits because they know they owe me
Owe me, oh God! I'm really livin' this shit
Yeah, I'm poppin' where I've never been
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout London and shit
Yeah, you've never done none of this shit
Good luck if you dissin' the kid
My niggas don't got no picks
Yeah rakin' it in for the kids
10K on Christmas
Fuck chillin' round the way, I'm beyond that
I'm just on the phone goin' over contracts
Okay that's good... okay that's good too...
Okay bring the money, finna sign at
Checks clear from the X where the line at
Teller lookin' like, "Damn how he got that?"
Jawn that he with, damn did he pop that?
Always watchin' me, that's why you don't got that

[Hook]
Gettin' rich
Never thought that I'd see a day like this
