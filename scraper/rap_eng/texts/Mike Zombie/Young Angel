Zombie On The Track

[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
Write my name in sky with fireworks so the whole world can get to know me, making music
But bitch I swear I kill this Karaoke
Chasing the fairy-tale life, man this shit can seem so distant
When all of the doubt is closer causing The Resistance, now that's Over
Show Me A Good Time cause bitch I plan to be here longer
I'm married to this dream of being a star, i'm at the alter
Yeah, nigga fuck is up? Alright
October, 21st yeah I was Up All Night
I had dreams of advancement, not much that i'm asking
Studio was my home and it never was Fancy
Still created a sound, all alone in the south returned home to the crown
Now everywhere I go I Shut It Down
Immma make my longevity Unforgettable, almost gave up on music until Drizzy called up my telephone
Yeah. Thank God I put the fight up, that type of news will make you mama Light Up
In this song, this that shit you spit when making it is taking too long
And when your grades ain't enough to where you got to withdraw
And your girl can't handle fame so you trying to break the shit off, bet she Miss Me now that i'm gone
Ain't no time to find your love now
Time to make my city proud
Shut the non-believers up, showing up and showing out
Back and fourth to Florida, just so I can see my child
Prince of this town, Willingboro, New Jersey
Y-you Can Thank Me Now. x2
