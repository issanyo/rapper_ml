[Chorus: Ant Beale]
You ain't gotta tell me, baby
I can already see how you feel
Let's stop talkin' 'bout it, baby
We should probably Netflix and chill
You ain't gotta tell me, baby
I can already see how you feel
Let's stop talkin' 'bout it, baby
We should probably Netflix and chill

[Verse 1: Ant Beale]
We should just get up to date if you're down to roll
I could bring you to my town, that's if you're down to go
We could run, throw a bag, that's just how we do
I'ma tell you right now, I love the way you move
Ay, is we chillin' or what?
Don't keep me waitin' girl, just tell me what up
Ay, is we chillin' or what?
I brought the 'Woods, I know you like to roll up
Ay girl take those clothes off
Fuck the movie, I'm ready to go
I hope you are ready for the camera
I'll make you a movie star

[Chorus: Ant Beale]
You ain't gotta tell me, baby
I can already see how you feel
Let's stop talkin' 'bout it, baby
We should probably Netflix and chill
You ain't gotta tell me, baby
I can already see how you feel
Let's stop talkin' 'bout it, baby
We should probably Netflix and chill

[Verse 2: Mike Zombie]
Oh baby don't play, you know it's gettin' too late
You know my Ls out of date but I am still on the way
You send flicks to my phone, please have them flicks ready babe
Anything rated R, she's rated ready for me
You've been talkin' so heavy and I'm critiquin' your walkin'
Yeah you gave out box offerings but I sell out box offices
Got my hand on your hips, two hours, too much to waste
I'm too into my pride, I'm finna come to your play
I got some Henny and juice, let's do Insidious too
You think that's scary, me too, okay let's do, do the dos
And we can do a little, I'ma make a move to kiss you
Netflix activated, know you on the same thing, baby

[Chorus: Ant Beale]
You ain't gotta tell me, baby
I can already see how you feel
Let's stop talkin' 'bout it, baby
We should probably Netflix and chill
You ain't gotta tell me, baby
I can already see how you feel
Let's stop talkin' 'bout it, baby
We should probably Netflix and chill

[Verse 3: Ant Beale]
Ay, I swear to God you fuckin' slay
You know I love the way you play
I want you in the worst way
I just wanna know how you feel, for real
I just wanna know, baby, keep it real
I just wanna know if you home alone
Would you send me somethin' special on your camera phone?
It's our little secret, she know I'ma keep it
She insane and shawty bad, I swear she need Jesus
She outta control
I might need to smoke 'fore you take off all your clothes

[Chorus: Ant Beale]
You ain't gotta tell me, baby
I can already see how you feel
Let's stop talkin' 'bout it, baby
We should probably Netflix and chill
You ain't gotta tell me, baby
I can already see how you feel
Let's stop talkin' 'bout it, baby
We should probably Netflix and chill
