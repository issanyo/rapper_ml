[Hook: Mike Zombie]
We on go, we on go
We on go, I'm on go
We on go, we on go
We on go, I'm on go
We on go, yeah that's a green light
I'm on go, yeah that's a green light
We on go, yeah that's a green light
I'm on go, yeah that's a green light

[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
Bitch they call me Zombie, I am a finesser
Getting to the paper, never folding under pressure
Now I run my city, tell these fuck niggas to catch up
Please tell me what happened to that boy y'all thought was next up
Please don't come around with all those stories that depress us
Get the fuck from 'round us, ain't our fault we fuckin' blessed up
The music bring the business, the music got my check up
I'm the type of nigga mix the business with the pleasure
Bitches send me texts, act like I ain't get it
I fucked your baby mama, while she was still pregnant
Woah I'm talking reckless, I'm not the one to mess with
You can't even judge me cause that's when they say it's wettest
Woo is back locked down, so I'm back locked in
Three months going in, boy I ain't stopping
Tee he said he stressed out, and he still boxed in
That's why I got to really get it popping
That's why I'm on go

[Hook: Mike Zombie]
We on go, we on go
We on go, I'm on go
We on go, we on go
We on go, I'm on go
We on go, yeah that's a green light
I'm on go, yeah that's a green light
We on go, yeah that's a green light
I'm on go, yeah that's a green light

[Verse 2: Benzi Ayo]
I'm on go, fly dope dealer
Trap nigga, model bitch at the Coachella
M's got her groove back, she ain't no stella
I be flashing, homie try me, thought he knew better
We be on go go, you a fucking fool
I get a [bozo] to smack for starring at my jewels
Militant, gunner creeping, that's my nigga Scoob
We in traffic with them ladders and a extra tool
All these rappers talking heavy but they really broke
I be stunting in my hood, they wanna get me smoked
Ugly bitches saying [aggy] and I do the most
Lookin' like a walking lick, that's why I keep the toast
Sick, crazy, I don't know if federales know
If they kick my trap door, I'ma let it blow
Hooligans with me daily, keep the metal close
Green light on these cowards, Zombie let 'em know

[Hook: Mike Zombie]
We on go, we on go
We on go, I'm on go
We on go, we on go
We on go, I'm on go
We on go, yeah that's a green light
I'm on go, yeah that's a green light
We on go, yeah that's a green light
I'm on go, yeah that's a green light

[Hook: Mike Zombie]
We on go, we on go
We on go, I'm on go
We on go, we on go
We on go, I'm on go
We on go, yeah that's a green light
I'm on go, yeah that's a green light
We on go, yeah that's a green light
I'm on go, yeah that's a green light
