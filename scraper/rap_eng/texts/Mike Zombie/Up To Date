[Hook]
Fuck with me so heavy cause the nigga hold weight
I pull up on you late but the whip is up to date
And a nigga hold weight
Pull up on ya late but the whip is up to date

[Verse 1]
Whip so new you can kiss the carpet
You know I'm with the shits so I gots to talk it
Looking like Rihanna and she talk that boss shit
We could've been something but you wasn't off it
Bitches be for the moment
I'm living in it
Valet parking at the Ritz, you know I'm gettin' it bitch
Lot of women on me, cause they mentally listen this shit
Money gone make me been poppin' since DMX was the clip
And we was whilin' on a two bout, 13 person
Still the same nigga with the Spongebob curtains
Still the same nigga getting round bitches getting nervous
Still the same youngin' with the laptop, working
Saw this youngin', he was talking on the net, crazy
Walk up to him, what he had to say, maybe
He shook my hand and then he walked away, fake
Your bluff is called, you just wanna get along, get the fuck off

[Hook]
Fuck with me so heavy cause the nigga hold weight
I pull up on you late but the whip is up to date
And a nigga hold weight
Pull up on ya late but the whip is up to date

[Verse 2]
Whip so new you can kiss the seats
Young Z O name stay in niggas mouth like teeth
And i'm tired of people saying "don't change on me"
Still on the same shit like a Mustard beat
Yeah I drive a nice car, nothing too fancy
Just a little something so the law enforcement don't harass me
No problem with helping out
You probably would put that past me
Just a column with no effort to get it before you ask me
Man I'm ventin' on this shit
Over-scheduled for this shit
Man, I'm trying to get to heaven but the Devil on my dick
I don't know how to sit down
I don't know how I can chill when
I can sit up in a house [?]
Tried to tell these niggas that I'm not for the play
Niggas be wanting everything but a fade
Last nigga try me, I spit all in his face
Don't get involved
You just wanna get along
Get the fuck off

[Hook]
Fuck with me so heavy cause the nigga hold weight
I pull up on you late but the whip is up to date
And a nigga hold weight
Pull up on ya late but the whip is up to date
Fuck with me so heavy cause the nigga hold weight
I pull up on you late but the whip is up to date
And a nigga hold weight
Pull up on ya late but the whip is up to date
