[Hook: Mike Zombie]
I got checks I ain't cash, I ain't wanna brag
I got checks in the stash, since we talkin' cash
I got checks I ain't cash, I ain't wanna brag
I got checks in the stash, since we talkin' cash
I got, I got, I got, I got
I got checks I ain't cash, I ain't wanna brag
I got checks in the stash, since we talkin' cash

[Verse 1: Mike Zombie]
(I got) people telling me the wrong things
(I got) niggas with me that is gon' swing
(I got) stripper bitches with some tongue rings
(I got) relationships, the on and off things
(I got) music that be goin' over heads
(I got) a woman that just missed her period
(I got) bunch of beefin' with my siblings
(I got) check up in the cut I didn't cash
Do it for the money like computer keyboards
You will get the bar if you're looking at yours
Niggas know the main goal to put the team on
Always need mine but I never need yours
Hollow called me up like you should've been on
Swear that I'ma get it 'fore the age of 24
Fuck niggas hatin', tell them niggas carry on
Verses so fly that these shits a carry on
Fuck niggas gon' hate on me anyway
Say I produce, hop on a track and get renegaded
Yeah I got the juice and I got the noose that cannot be hanged with
Yeah tell Mr. Huxtable that I want his spot at the walk of fame, bitch

[Pre-Hook: Mike Zombie]
I'm young and reckless, you can probably tell by all this Henny that I got up in my cup
Got all these niggas in my pocket, why these niggas steady clocking, bet they hope that I go broke and run it up

[Hook: Mike Zombie]
I got checks I ain't cash, I ain't wanna brag
I got checks in the stash, since we talkin' cash
I got checks I ain't cash, I ain't wanna brag
I got checks in the stash, since we talkin' cash
I got, I got, I got, I got
I got checks I ain't cash, I ain't wanna brag
I got checks in the stash, since we talkin' cash

[Verse 2: Connect]
(I got) niggas and they pray for my downfall
(I got) dogs and they bust at Greyhounds, y'all
(I got) a bag of hashtags, straight pounds yo
(I got) haters so I don't stay around y'all
(I got) problems, for money I'll two step
(I got) a chopper I ain't get to use yet
(I got) commas I ain't get through yet
(I got) phone blowin' up, missed calls like a new ref
Or the fourth quarter, pound only two left
Plug life, more money but I do less
Niggas grade A but they got a few F's
No we don't play boy, no Hugh Heff
Kill it, apocalyptic, accounts that's filled with a lot of digits
Money in the air, and I gotta get it
Got my checks up, doctors visits
Found a lot of snakes, I ain't tryna get bit
All I hear is hissing
Money so long I'ma need a intermission
I ball big, kinda like the Simpsons
I could never go broke, weed money looking like coco
I kinda wanna be like lobos
But for now I'm ghost though
(I got) pound of the pint for the 25
Only look at things from the money side
Laughing to the bank, I'm a funny guy
Gotta keep the thing by the tummy, ah
Talked to the real, hope the fake die
Y'all say the heart black like Akon
And your bitch give me box like Layla
And I knock it out the park like A-Rod
(I got) checks I ain't even got to cash yet
Talking rich, I been like Affleck
But they don't really hear me, man they act deaf
Like a Nike warehouse, got mad checks
Got the traphouse jumping like a system in it
Got a pile full of checks that they wish I finished
Talkin' bread I can't pass like it's the limit
All this Jersey-ness, I need Mitchell in it

[Verse 3: Mike Zombie]
I got gold in my mouth like I'm from the south side
I got bitches all in my room with they mouth wide
I got bitches that swallow for green like popye
I got niggas that really know that I'm 'bout mine
I got people that wanna know why I'm not signed
I am really the black sheep, I am not lyin'
I know a group of friends that I fucked, I'm talkin' all five
Now they hit me and act like they got the wrong line (Shit)
That's what happen when you stunt with the kid
You ain't know a nigga talk like this
Finally 'bout to pay my tuition
I ain't doin' no more wishing
Bitch I'm well off, don't you get it?
Paris to Africa, the whole world listening
Fuck am I concerned with a nigga in my city?
Still wiggin' out, call me Z-O-Wiggins
Khaled on the text and he told me go get it
Sending out the beats and the niggas don't pick 'em
Shit so flames they don't know what to do with 'em
609 the wave and you can't get a ripple
Made "Started" niggas made Willingboro wiggle
Fuck I look like even hatin' on your ass
When a young nigga still got checks in the stash
