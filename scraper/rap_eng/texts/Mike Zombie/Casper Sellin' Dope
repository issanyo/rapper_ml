[Hook]
Fuck these niggas, I ain't never need 'em
Niggas might just wanna see you bleed
Told you niggas, I was never real
Eating better, I can feed my demons
I done made this shit in hell, is hella spooky
Everything is Casper selling dope
Couple years ago and get me one
Nigga know this ain't your friendly ghost

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm out here jugging in Atlanta
Got niggas banging, they don't do bananas
We don't give a fuck 'bout getting minutes
Praying every day like I'm a menace
Yes I know I got the Future flow
Cause that shit is stupid crazy though
Other niggas gonna take it though
Least I'm man enough to say it though
Bitch, I'm fucking round with model girls
That's some shit that you never heard
I ain't listening when I say words
Just take your girl to respect the curb
What they talking 'bout, bitch I'm a genius
I run the nicest but I'm still the meanest
You can join up and you spitting B Mix
I been wilding since a fucking foetus
Fucking up the numbers
That means I been wanting tickets
Bitches, I be gonna fuck her like damn
God damn, I am hot damn
Fuck the bitches 'til there's nothing left
And I don't watch my back, I keep her 'fore I stare
You could never be too good for us
Zombie walking, what the fuck you say?

[Hook]
Fuck these niggas, I ain't never need 'em
Niggas might just wanna see you bleed
Told you niggas, I was never real
Eating better, I can feed my demons
I done made this shit in hell, is hella spooky
Everything is Casper selling dope
Couple years ago and get me one
Nigga know this ain't your friendly ghost

[Verse 2]
Bitch you know I'm back up in Atlanta
Know exactly why I ain't get an answer
You too busy fucking round with rappers
I just got the cash, you want the plastic
Young nigga gotta pay his taxes
Fucking with you, that's just going backwards
How I know this, how you acting
But you would never catch your nigga lacking
Do you know you just a bottle girl?
I just live up in the bottle girl
You a half time, model girl
Might as well play the lotto girl
Fuck they talking 'bout, bitch I don't need 'em
I be in and out if I decide to feed 'em
Some strippers cool and some strippers beasting
I be they daddy if the bitches need one
You just want the numbers
Zombie, Zombie know
How the fuck you coming, never been no dummy
Damn, God damn, I am hot damn
Fuck the bitches 'til there's nothing left
And I don't watch my back, I keep her 'fore I stare
You could never be too good for us
Zombie walking, what the fuck you say?

[Hook]
Fuck these niggas, I ain't never need 'em
Niggas might just wanna see you bleed
Told you niggas, I was never real
Eating better, I can feed my demons
I done made this shit in hell, is hella spooky

Couple years ago and get me one
Nigga know this ain't your friendly ghost
