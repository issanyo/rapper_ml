Hook
They gotta make me a Jersey, They gotta make me a jersey
Look how I’m balling, look how I’m balling, they gotta make me a jersey
Look how I’m balling, looking like Jordan, they gotta make me a jersey
It’s getting easy, hit up the league, tell them to make me a jersey (whoo)
They gotta make me a jersey, someone call the NBA tell and tell em to make me a Jersey
They gotta make me a jersey, someone call the NBA tell and tell em to make me a Jersey

Verse 1
I probably can play in the NBA
I get a bucket on any day
I make it look easy on any play
I’m probably the reason you didn’t play
They better hang up my jersey
Hang it up in the arena
Guess how many people could stop me
What number is Gilbert Arenas
They say the sky is the limit but I say I’m heading to Venus
I don’t just say I’m the best
I like to make you believe it
You know the jumper is water, I got to give you the Fiji
Every year I make the All-Star I’m not missing a weekend
Every year I ball out, y’all just keep taking the ball out
Everything’s a And One, y’all know I don’t call foul
All about that Handlelife, I can’t put the ball down
If you selling my jersey, everyone a get sold out

Pre-Hook
They gotta make me a jersey, someone call the NBA tell and tell em to make me a Jersey
They gotta make me a jersey, someone call the NBA tell and tell em to make me a Jersey

Verse 2
I need a Mitchell and Ness deal
You know I gotta finesse still
Soon as I put on the jersey
They taking pictures of the best player
We balling out of arenas
You probably playing at the rec still
You think you doing it big
This how you do it double XL
This something they never seen before
You think this a challenge I make it look easy though
Now I’m at the top and there’s nowhere for me to go
Hit up a team, hit up the league, I need a jersey to go

Hook
They gotta make me a Jersey, They gotta make me a jersey
Look how I’m balling, look how I’m balling, they gotta make me a jersey
Look how I’m balling, looking like Jordan, they gotta make me a jersey
It’s getting easy, hit up the league, tell them to make me a jersey (whoo)
They gotta make me a jersey, someone call the NBA tell and tell em to make me a Jersey
They gotta make me a jersey, someone call the NBA tell and tell em to make me a Jersey
