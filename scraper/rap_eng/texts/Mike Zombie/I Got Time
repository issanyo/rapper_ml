[Hook]
Fuck am I in a rush? I got time, I got time
I know I'm underrated but I still got time
What is the rush? I got time, I got time
I know I'm underrated but a nigga got time
Fuck is the rush? I got time, I got time
I know I'm gon' be famous but I still got time
Fuck isp? I got time, I got time
This game, I'm gonna change it but I still got time

[Verse 1]
Fresh off takin' pictures with a bunch of fans
Don't ask me for a picture if you don't know who I am
I can deal with groupie bitches, the thing I can't stand
Is groupie ass nigga pretendin' to be my mans
Bitch it's ZO, and I am OVO
No disrespect to the fans, I just don't fuck with phony people
BET nominated double platinum producer
Rappin' ass producer comin' for all the niggas who do it
But fuck am I in a rush? I got time, I got time
Mike WiLL got the game right now and he pushin' 25
I'm 21, yeah Mike Zom like wine
Get better with time, y'all ain't heard a beat in a year's time
And I'm just sick and tired of niggas sayin' Young ZO suck
And I'm just sick and tired of people sayin' I got here by luck
Like before SFTB I wasn't fuckin' shit up
And I'd be lyin' if I said I ain't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Maybach rented, Mike Zom don't lie
This for them niggas in the Borough talkin' 'bout mines
You rubbin' pennies boy and still ride the River Line
Don't talk 'bout money with me, boy, it was 2K for the ride
Like fuck is up? With these niggas?
How they comin'? Like some bitches
What they want? Recognition
Well wishes opposition, everyone got opinions
Best part 'bout opinions is that they're all just opinions
Fuck everybody with 'em
Beats, bars, man I swear I'm bionic
What I'm in it for, bitch to be iconic
In no rush, I know that it's all about timin'
Think I'm on, no bitch I'm really still grindin'
Only niggas who I be with who I fuck with for real
You other niggas actin' extra like y'all got me the deal
Niggas don't want me to spit, man I'm just keepin' it trill
But niggas gon' get these bars so nigga fuck how you feel
