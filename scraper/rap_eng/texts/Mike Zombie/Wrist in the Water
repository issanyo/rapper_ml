[Hook: Rich the Kid]
I'ma break my fuckin' wrist in the water, nigga
Traphouse got bricks, take an order, nigga
We do not take any disrespect
I'm finally rich, now I got a check
No janitor, nigga, got ki's
I'm in Cali smokin' real good weed
And I'm still screamin', "Fuck you, pay me"
Drop top Benz like I'm ridin' in the 80s

[Verse 1: Jimmy Johnson]
Fuck a nigga out like a groupie
Man I don't need a hand, yeah I'm gucci
Got rubber for the bands like it's coochi
Pocket got a roll, no sushi
Make a bitch say uh like she Juvi'
Pull up to the block in a Suzuki
Tryna get the hang of doin' wheelies on the stretch
Pop a lot of slang, got the lingo in a twist
My hood niggas swipin', they don't need to move a brick
A hot boy with a cold crucifix
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', I'm like ball is life
I'm movin' more bricks, I ain't talkin' 'bout white
She callin', she callin', keep callin' all night
Your #WomanCrushWednesday's my main crush tonight
Her nigga get left when she come get it right
And I'm on that money tonight
That money, that money, I'm money tonight
Came in here lookin' like money and shit
Probably could fuck on your bitch
Cause I probably smell like I'm rich
Let that lil' bitch take a sniff
Let that lil' bitch take a wooh!
Bet that she get high as shit
Cause I'm dope in this bitch

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
I'ma break my wrist
Lookin' at this pot
Pyrex on the bitch
And I cannot stop
Where is all the cut?
So I can make the rocks
Hop off in my car
Pull up on the block
Oh my God, oh my God, prices low
Get it and go
Oh my God, oh my God, prices high
But you gon' buy
And we had to tax
Me and Pablo tax free
I got good guys with me
Many shawtys and an Uzi, you can get a whole clip for the free
I'm a real fuckin' G
I don't know about these niggas
They ain't ever trap with me
And I bet I make that wrist work
And I bet I made your bitch hurt
She gon' walk until her feet hurt
I'ma walk and these Guiseppes nurse it

[Verse 3: Mike Zombie]
Okay it's OG Maco and it's Rich the Kid
Niggas talkin' that the kid is rich
Wonder why these niggas all up in my pocket
Checkin' like a gold-diggin' bitch
I will never understand this shit
I will never understand my wrist
Cause this shit is icy and this shit is flooded
Put it both together, that is how a nigga
Break his fuckin' wrist in the water, nigga
Got niggas in red and blue, you don't know Peter Parker, nigga
We do not take any disrespect
Fuckin' with us and you gon' get checked
7/10/92, I was born with no chill
How I'm s'posed to chill when a nigga got kids?
Yesterday in fact, man a nigga got killed
609, dummy documentin' where we live
Yeah shit ain't pretty where I'm brought up, nigga
Swear I gotta leave the scene for my daughter, nigga
We do not take any disrespect
How many times I done told you that?
Fuck is it that you don't get?
Prolly that's money and a lil' bad bitch
Young Z-O, get this shit with interest
Bitch I need a nurse, ice pack for my wrist
