Broke niggas really make me nervous
Need to go and find your purpose
Fuck you talkin’, bitch I’m perfect
Really had to go and learn this, and
Running round like shit is urgent
Fuck you talkin’, bitch I earned this
Ten thousand hours, put your work in
You don’t ever do no work, but you wan’ get rich
‘Chu you don’t do no work, you don’t do no work, ‘chu don’t do no work
But you wan’ get rich
‘Chu you don’t do no work, ‘chu you don’t do no work, ‘chu you don’t do no work

[Verse 1]
I pull up, I hop out, a cool young nigga
Never concerning ‘bout who fuck with ‘em
Your MCM a cool bum nigga
But y’all is the same ‘cause you fuck with him
Smoking so much I need new lungs nigga
The money, get counted up with two thumbs nigga
You fake if your niggas is and you run with ‘em
Ex bitches tryna get me back like soo-yung nigga
Walked in the building with all my niggas
We disobeying the law my nigga
The bitches, they listen to all my wishes
I used to watch up with detergent from the kitchen
Now I cop YSL for my young nigga
Never going broke, talking no more nigga
Cynthia could tell you it was so hard nigga
But to those hard times we yellin’ so long nigga, ay
Record label meeting like tomorrow my nigga
I don’t even know what they talkin’ ‘bout nigga
But I really got to thank god my nigga
That it ain’t about production but the bars my nigga
When I’m dead and gone they gon’ miss me bitch

Dropped out so I could drop them hits
Who you know that’s cut like this

[Verse 2]
I’m getting this money, it’s something on me
Need me a milly, I’m really hungry
Back in the day though you fronted on me
So I’ma fuck your friends instead for stunting on me
‘Member when I had the Benz always on E
Windows ain’t work, neither did the heat
Broke down every damn week then repeat
Now I'm coppin’ with the cash, ain’t nothing on lease
You ain’t in my bracket, Uncle Sam you can ask him
But we no relation, writing off transactions
The figures I’m getting, you would change if you had it
That’s why god chose me ‘cause I was working when I asked him
I was makin’ ‘bout 20 beats in 24
Hours, 9 to 5 was taking up the school
Struggled in math, but I count the money good
The percentages what everybody getting understood
Know that you feel it, you’re getting old now
We was all rapping, tell me where your ass now?
609, it really go down
Fuck you talkin’ ‘bout, they call this shit the Lil Motown
I’m from it, I love it, it ain’t none’ like it
13 parks and the shit’s all divided
From the wrong side where the guns get ignited
Wrong place, wrong time, no lying
