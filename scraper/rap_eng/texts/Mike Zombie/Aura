The money turned my Shaqs into Bapesters
I take the money give it back to where I came from
I’m looking at the game sideways
Frank Sinatra of this shit, I did it my way
So far ahead of my time
I’m about to start another life
Look behind you, I’m about to pass you twice
Not the Blueprint, it’s the Su-print
I bought the game and got change, keep your two cents
Hit Miami, came back with a tan
I took an insta in a steam room
That’s a sonogram
I’m so high, I don’t want to land
You want to battle bring a P and a hundred grand

Nino Brown how I pose in my section
Get rid of you rappers like colds when you catch them
Coppers run me down I have no recollections
The flow, is a weapon
Six-speed just went to seven
I’m raw like no protection
You listen, get your infections

Impressive upon impression
No cheques, then get the message
Unless it’s intercepted, so I send it again
Got the game locked in my brain like the prison’s within
But I don’t got no time for jail time
Im beyond that
The only pen I see is when I sign a contract
My name’s Sudan
TN say we claiming bomb threats
They trying to send me down under like a wombat

Funny how these rappers getting awkward with me
If weird stares were chairs we would all get a seat
Put it on the big screen so we all get to see
How I'mma blow like 50 in 2003
Because I’m the best
Wild wild west I’m on my big willie
Tell Warner I'mma need a milli for the pub dealie
Bet the money make her do a backflip
Every cinema stash like a top-flip
And ain’t no half-way players, I’m the man all the time
Ain’t no half-way famous, get my money on time
Ever HBK gang everything good
Like a guilty verdict I got nothing left to prove
I’ve been doing me
I really hope you doing you
I been working working setting up for album number two
And I was here, all praise to the most high
I did this without a deal or a co-sign

Last week top floor suite at the Palazzo
Had them walking around ass-naked like Frida Kahlo
You know the deal with me and models
Young Su can name more women than Pete Pablo

I’m where I want to be yea yea yea
Because they fuck with me yea yea yea
So we don’t got to talk anymore
So we don’t got to talk anymore
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no no
So we don’t got to talk anymore
So we don’t got to talk anymore
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no no
