[Intro]
Got, (Clears throat) Make s-
Gotta make sure all the sounds right
I like that one
Just so I can there, you know what I mean?
Ok let’s take it there, yeah
I been far too kind, long time
Wooh, look, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look up in the air, we up to no good
I’m doing a lot of shit that other niggas wish they could
The family Herpes, I got y’all forever as I should
I know my position, it’s just something no one understood
Welcome to chop city
Where niggas thinkin’ they know me but I’m like not really
I look amazing but my situation not pretty
Because I’m never at peace
‘Cause foreign faces tryna find they places then get a piece
That shit will get my brother irritated, then lift his piece
Then let it go just like an argument and rest you in peace
That statement is just for the fuck niggas that’s thinking it’s sweet
A beef is not my cup of tea but try and drink it with me
I love the feeling that I get when I’m stunt and they can’t stop it
Or when you pullin’ up in the latest without college
Or knowing that they envy your life but all hide it
Or knowing it’s gon’ shut shit down soon as you drop it
You niggas tryna be like Mike is not an option
Paid 600 on like mike’s so niggas stop it
Production and rapping, swear I got the gift and the curse
Niggas is only gon’ fuck with what they was fuckin’ wit’ first
Prior to Started, my bars is what they was fuckin’ wit’ first
Like this would’ve been better if you would’ve heard my tag first
Well that works, backwards
Whole life, reverse
God got me, you can tell that he working, don’t need church
Nigga church

[Interlude: Drake]
It’s a shame if you don’t notice the shift in energy around me, I mean you can’t be oblivious to what’s going on around you, and I just kind of like woke up one day like yeah, this is my time. This is my ting, I run this!

[Verse 2]
Yeah the dreads getting long, the money’s getting long too
Of course when they need a favor is when they gon’ call you
Whatever happened to “hello” or “yo”, I'm bouta fall through
Niggas intimidated then play this shit like it’s all you
Goddamn, when you see me please don’t treat me like I got five hands
Like I can’t find a parking spot, I been through a lot man
I am the nigga to be
I ain’t that nigga that get told “yo take this picture for me”
No crown for the town for them to give it to me
I get tired of tellin’ the future, y’all don’t listen to me
It be like I say I’ma do it then I do it
And then it be like y’all say I won’t do it then I do it
Either way y’all been wrong for four and a half years to be approximate
Bridges, burn, just get ready to swim to the other side of it
Niggas that’s there already, they already know what time it is
When niggas see me they just say what’s up ‘cause they behind the kid
Goddamn, goddamn
Everyone got me chopped man
