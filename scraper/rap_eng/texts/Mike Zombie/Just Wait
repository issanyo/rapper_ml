Me and my niggas gon be straight just wait

[Verse  1]
I got bitches in the crib and they actin up
I remember going to the club had to lap it up
My brother blood he got stain from Cali back to us
I gave your bitch all of this dick spectacular
Yall niggas talkin hella shit but can't back it up
I used to have that college money so my racks been up
And if i'm on the track I'm only spittin facts what's up
And if up in onyx I Promise that that's lit up
I texted your girl and she just texted me back to fuck
Oh yeah I hit, and then I hit the sack on her
These rappers ass these niggas need to wrap it up
I spit crack and I don't need no feedback from you
I don't got time and niggas insecure for what
Think It's these bars is he talking about me or what
Nigga fall in line ya'll niggas worried about us

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man I kicked the same bitches out the crib cause they acting up
Can't bring hoes around hoes cause they fuck shit up
Ay look my clothes got holes from the black lit up
They say we gettin major figures I'm like yeah that's us
They said Mike you got security you good what's up
They said you walking around like you looking scared or something
I said it sound like ya'll on my dick man this shit is to stunt
Cause I'm a don I shouldn't be talking to fuck niggas
I know my worth I won't let a fuck nigga fuck shit up
So all you fuck niggas get the fuck around from us
Welcome to Jers where It seems like this shit split up
Welcome To South Jers where the north don't fuck with us

I spit subliminals just to leave your head fucked up
Nigga fall in line ya'll niggas worried about us
The fuck
