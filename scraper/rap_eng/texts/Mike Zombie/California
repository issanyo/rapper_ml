You 'bout to pour up and go up
I'm 'bout to throw up, nigga, so what?

Hundred thousand, man it's real
Nigga really wrote his will
Pullin' up in rental' wheels
Tryna live up in the Hills (I swear)
L.A. you payin' the bills
I don't plan on comin' back

Money on money

You tell me that shit all the time
But you know how to party
From California
