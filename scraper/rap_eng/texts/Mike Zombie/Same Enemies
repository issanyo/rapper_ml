[Hook]
Aye I hate to be selfish, this is all fucking mine
I've been giving giving giving all the goddamn time
And you was just so selfish all the goddamn time
Just been giving giving giving me a hard fucking time

Some type of people in this world, man, bitches and niggas
Somehow y'all niggas still manage to be bitch niggas, uh
Real friends got the same enemies
Real niggas don't got bitch tendencies

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm wildin', with my niggas is lit up in this bitch
Rose gold, listenin' when they sit up on my wrist
Old hoes, talk about, man, they want the old dick
Oh no, ya burnt out, I'm on that new shit
Let it go, exotic dancers and strippers love to kid
I get a dancer for extra dollars, she doin' extra shit
I felt wrong, all of the shit that niggas still with
I'm puttin' on, for my city like niggas never did
Nigga take her back, I ain't fuckin' yo bitch no mo'
Lot of rappin, ever since I was a kid [?]
Take me out, coach I ain't playin' with niggas no mo'
Bored of music, you niggas makin' these medio-co[?]
Got advice, like, "Oh yeah, you did this shit befo'"
Came up, and I ain't the same nigga no' mo'
But I ain't different, just ain't with the funny shit no mo'
Ya money low as the money my strippers pick up off the flo'

[Hook]
Aye I hate to be selfish, this is all fucking mine
I've been giving giving giving all the goddamn time
And you was just so selfish all the goddamn time
Just been giving giving giving me a hard fucking time

Middle fingers to the sky
Fuck the other side
Middle fingers to the sky
Fuck the other side
Middle fingers to the sky
Fuck the other side
Middle finger to the sky
Fuck the other side

Some type of people in this world, man, bitches and niggas
Somehow y'all niggas still manage to be bitch niggas, uh
Real friends got the same enemies
Real niggas don't got bitch tendencies

[Verse 2]
If my nigga don't fuck with you, I don't fuck with you, either
I'm that nigga you got a problem addressin' when you see 'em
They talkin' bout' this and that, I can't wait until I see it
Nevermind I'm too busy with gettin' busy with yo' BM
Been a year, goddamn, a nigga still hittin'
Five-fifty, one call could get yo' life taken
No more games, niggas [?]
