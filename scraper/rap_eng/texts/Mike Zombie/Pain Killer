[Chorus]
We used to have it all down
You would always know how
To take it all away from me
And bring me back from falling

[Refrain]
You're my pain killer
My pain killer

[Verse]
Now you [?]
As fast as you want me to go
We used to have it all down
Yeah, used to always just know how
To take it all away from
Just make it go away
Just make it go away

[Refrain]
You're my pain killer
You're my pain killer
You're my
You're my pain killer
My pain killer

[Chorus]
When we used to have it all down
You would always just know how
To make it go away from
And bring us back from falling

[Refrain]
You're my pain killer
You're my pain ---
You're my pain killer
You're my pain ---
You're my pain killer
You're my pain ---
You're my pain killer
My pain killer
You're my pain ---, oh
You're my pain killer
You're my pain ---

[Outro]
Just take it all away now
Make it go away now
Just take it all away now
Make it go away now
