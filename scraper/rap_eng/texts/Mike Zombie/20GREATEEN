[Intro]
Yuh (Zombie On The Track)
Woah
Emotion, emotion, emotion, emotion
Emo-

[Chorus]
Yuh, Literally drinking and driving
God in the passenger seat (uh)
I told my nigga I'm wilding
He said, "Just leave it to me" (uh)
Ask him what year that we in
I told him it's 20Greateen (uh)
Ask him what year that we in
I told him it's 20Greateen (yeah)
ZO, T-T, Wins, Yeah
6-0, Nina, Who's that? His
Say that, to my, last name, day
You don't like how I'm living, nigga kill me then
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Okay let's get this shit started (uh)
[?]
It's the producer that did it when y'all niggas said that I wouldn't be an artist (uh)
Fuck it, I'm pretty accomplished (uh)
Two years since I dropped so they starving (uh)
Like it a zombie got them wilding all up in the comments like, "you gon' drop it" (huh)
Yup and I'm sorry you waited up
I'm still in the hood like a cranium
[?]
I'm bout to come with the bombers (uh)
I brought a board and I raise it up
I'm jumping right out the gymnasium
Fuck being humble and modest (uh)
I am the best, and we honest
Long nights in the basement
Tryna get this shit and I was winging it
And now I'm living it this shit is different
It ain't no me and them, you know the difference
I put my niggas in position when it's lit
And they don't act like I did it for them
I think it's safe to say that I'm the realest In it
And I don't give a fuck, I'm burning all my bridges, like

[Chorus]
Yuh, Literally drinking and driving
God in the passenger seat (uh)
I told my nigga I'm wilding
He said, "Just leave it to me" (uh)
Ask him what year that we in
I told him it's 20Greateen (uh)
Ask him what year that we in
I told him it's 20Greateen (yeah)
ZO, T-T, Wins, Yeah
6-0, Nina, Who's that? His
Say that, to my, last name, day
You don't like how I'm living, nigga kill me then
Let's get it

[Verse 2]
Okay, since we keeping it G (uh)
I'm the one playing for keeps (uh)
My nigga said I do not make it and he will not make it that shit cut me deep (uh)
I am not making a beat (uh)
The work really speaking for me (uh)
[?]
And that shit came straight out the bible
I do not have any idols
"Zombie there's nobody like you"
"That's probably why nobody likes you"
You cannot stop the kid, no
I got infinity miles
I got too many to feed now
Fuck around and over prize you
6 or 9 day on the wait
[?]
I spent two years in L.A. and then come back and running the city the same (uh)
Peeping this on my IG
Ain't even finished this verse
This was a banger regardless before I got time to go finish for sure

[Chorus]
Yuh, Literally drinking and driving
God in the passenger seat (uh)
I told my nigga I'm wilding
He said, "Just leave it to me"
Ask him what year that we in
I told him it's 20Greateen
Ask him what year that we in
I told him it's 20Greateen
ZO, T-T, Wins, Yeah
6-0, Nina, Who's that? His
Say that, to my, last name, day
You don't like how I'm living, nigga kill me then
Let's get it
