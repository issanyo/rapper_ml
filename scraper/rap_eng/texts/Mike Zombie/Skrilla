Talk to 'em!
Money power respect, money cars and clothes
I got the digits to 5, digit in front of the O's
I never wanted the fame, I just stumbled up in it
On the low getting green, tryna mack with splinter
Please nigga, I am looking like the fucking plug, yeah
Pull up to the car wash, they give me a nudge, yeah
They said not to be so nosey, do you sell them drugs, yeah
I'm like no, got so much skrilla could be screaming fuck yea
Juggin' juggin', I'm finessin', boy this is no facade
True story, they mistakin' me for a dope dealer
How you do it, and you niggas is still broke niggas, go figure
Til' infinite gettin' to more skrilla
