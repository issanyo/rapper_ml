Told mama
I'm a thug nigga, drug dealer, gang banger, young nigga
Bandana and some locs
Told mama
I'm a thug nigga, drug dealer, gang banger, young nigga
Still chuck the 4
I'm a hustler, baby (come here, daddy)
I'm a hustler, baby (come here, daddy)
I'm a hustler, baby (come here, daddy)
Now I got that money, everybody love me

[Verse 1]
I'm a thug nigga, I might drop someone
I'm a thug nigga, I might flock someone
I'm a thug nigga, make the foreign do a donut
If I like her I'ma hit it, I don't care who fucked
I'm a thug nigga, I don't smoke hookah
I fuck bitches and talk about who walls looser
What it look like, what it smells like?
Does she know how to give the head right?
Ay, all my homies feel like "Fuck life"
Pop tag, nigga, fuck price
They say I'm wrong but I feel so right
Straight out the gate with the Glock on my side
I don't turn down fades
I don't got feelings, I feel no ways
He was cryin' when he was in that cage
He probably bleed for seven days, nigga

Baby down for villain gang
Little known from Miller Gang
Murder GD [?] from swine, they be havin' things
Q Ball, Lil' Wolf, free Troop and Baby Budda
All my young niggas, the whole hood love them boys
They're some shooters
Big round, little round, both with the gun clap
One in jail for the bank lick
The other went down full of straps
Tiny Rock, Heavy D, [?] from Nutty Blocc
Turtle 3 and G-Man from Santana Blocc
Baby Odi, Tiny Creep, hope for the smilin' me
