[Intro: Yowda and YG]
Imma' slide to Bompton on this one
Yeah what up Yowda
Yeah what up YG
I'm just doing my motherfucking thang
Bitch it's YG, 4hunnid

[Verse 1: YG]
Give it up, give it up slide like this
I heard you getting money, I get mines like this
I fucked her in the whip, had to recline that bitch
My girl caught me cheating, had to start lying to that bitch
I got homies' on the block, got homies' in the pen
I give em they respect cos I ain't ever been
Ciroc' with the cranberries
Come with the bands
Only pass I need, is my passport to Japan

[Verse 2: Yowda]
Started with them grams
Then we moved up the weight
To much work for the locals so we moved it out of state
Bass in that trunk, I ain't talking speakers
Pimped out, hoes come in two like a pair of sneakers
I'm in a two seater, but i'm riding solo
Horse on the logo but it ain't polo
Two hundred on the dash
Got my 45 stashed
Just came from the trap
Duffel Bag full of cash, Nigga Yowda!

[Hook x2: Yowda and YG]
Nigga, One for the money
Two for the hoes
Three for the goes
Four for the ?
Five for the niggas that be always on they toes
Either focused or they go
That's how it goes

[Verse 3: Yowda]
Paper Chasing got me on a roller coaster
Drug Dealing got me on a wanted poster
Moving through these streets like a brand new Testarossa
Used my Hermes belt as a weapon holster
These niggas hatin' on me cos my jewelry colder
And my bitches badder
Whip with a faster motor
It's in my blood tho, pops was a soldier
Chipped off the block like a 9 piece I told ya

[Verse 4: YG]
Tell my girls i'm getting closer
I'm trying to get on Oprah
I'm riding with that toaster, cos my mama worried
So this money gotta hurry
My lil' homie' in trial his time based off the jury, he a real one
If you don't think time is money, than you a joke
You spend all day in your hood snorting coke
I can't respect that, I neglect that
30 racks for a show so I private jet that, nigga uh!

[Hook x2: Yowda and YG]
Nigga, One for the money
Two for the hoes
Three for the goes
Four for the ?
Five for the niggas that be always on they toes
Either focused or they go
That's how it goes
