[Intro: Mitch]
I'm a dog
I'm, I'm a dog
I'm a dog
I'm a dog
I'm a dog

[Chorus: Mitch]
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog, yeah
Had your bitch in my bed last night (oh she bad)
Told me she need me to get her right (she was on)
Had your bitch in my bed last night (yeah she bad)
She told she need me to get her right, hold up

[Verse 1: Mitch]
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog
I fucked your bitch and you don't wanna see the post
Every time I come around, she choose up
Diamonds shining slow motion with the stool cups
Yeah, I'm a nigga, I'm a dog
Call my nigga Jizzle for the law
Fuck 12 'til I'm resting in the grave
Catch me if you can, I'm getting paid
One time my niggas getting money (one time)
One time my sisters getting dirty
One time my niggas in the block
One time my niggas on the lot
One time for my niggas in the pen
One time for my niggas getting ends
I swear to God, nigga I'm a dog
Got your bitch in my bed and she cold

[Chorus: Mitch]
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog, yeah
Had your bitch in my bed last night (oh she bad)
Told me she need me to get her right (she was on)
Had your bitch in my bed last night (yeah she bad)
She told she need me to get her right, hold up

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm a dog, I'm a dog (nigga roof)
Hit it from the back, on your paws (bitch uh)
Said she got a whole husband and all (whole husband)
I'm just trying to fuck you like the law (fuck the law bitch)
I'm just tryna buy some Louis for that ass (for that ass bitch)
Tryna fit you in a Aston with that ass (with that ass bitch)
Would you keep it on the low-low for some cash? (for that cash bitch)
Got a bitch so don't post me on the 'gram (uh-oh)
I ain't lovin', no, no, no, I want that sex (I want that sex)
Put you hair in a ponytail, I want that neck (I want that neck)
Fuck a Instagram model just to flex (just to flex)
Put you hair in a ponytail, I want that neck
I want your friend, I want her next, I wanna try out that sex
I wanna stay out all night with the homies while you sleep in that bed
I wanna still be your man and still creep with Roxanne
Yeah I might fuck these bitches but I love you, girl I swear

[Chorus: Mitch]
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog, yeah
Had your bitch in my bed last night (oh she bad)
Told me she need me to get her right (she was on)
Had your bitch in my bed last night (yeah she bad)
She told she need me to get her right, hold up

[Verse 3: Mitch]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
If I could pick, I would pick all of you hoes
God damn, it's like ring around the rosey
I don't even wanna chose you bros
I'm on my bitch tonight, I'm on my bitch tonight
I'm on my bitch tonight, I'm on my bitch tonight
And you know I got like forty-five bitches blowing up my phone
And girl, if you ain't with the business, I suggest you find your own way home
A real nigga in your bed right now
Better get with the plan right now
You ain't fucking with your man right now
'Cause you should know I'm the man right now

[Chorus: Mitch]
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog
I swear I'm a nigga, I'm a dog, yeah
Had your bitch in my bed last night
Told me she need me to get her right
Had your bitch in my bed last night
She told she need me to get her right, hold up
