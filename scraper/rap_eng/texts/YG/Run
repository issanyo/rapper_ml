Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run
Ten
Twenties
Fifties
Hundreds (Hell yea)
Hold up let me count this money
Bring that ass back, come get it from me (Hell yea)
Hundreds in the air
Keep that booty running, running, running, x5
Ya get money, my team call it play time
I'm drunk, ass spilling from the bass line
In the club, twenty deep with he frenchside
When you see me can i get a high five (high five)
Watch so flow, call it coldcone, furious fly
