[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
I been self-made from the dribble
I was been sayin' I'm a killer, look
Playin' no games with you niggas
Pop clutch, switch lanes on you niggas, look
I laid down the game for you niggas
Taught you how to charge more than what they paid for you niggas
Own the whole thing for you niggas
Re-invest, double up then explained for you niggas
It gotta be love, who run the whole city? It gotta be cuz
This for the pieces I took off the Monopoly board
And ya'll niggas false claims, it gotta be fraud
Just keep the hood up out your mouth and you gotta be charged
I doubled up, tripled up, nigga what?
Banged on the whole game, I ain't give a fuck
Nobody trippin', had no business, got my digits up
And when I drop, you know I'm 'bout to fuck the city up

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
And I come through fly (check) no co-sign
I ain't need radio to do mine, I done fine
And I take my time (check) and take my tribe
Every level that I crossed in this game like state lines
It was visionary, either I'm genius or you niggas scary
Maybe it's both and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in the streets tryna feed the babies
The single mama's workin' hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set that's doin' it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
It's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars
It's how you start off a curb server, end up a boss
It's how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat drippin' down your face 'cause the mission was hard

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was 5 chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked

[Verse 3: YG]
Last time that I checked, I got the front end and the back
We on the way and that's a fact
This real, this ain't rap, where everybody wanna act pro-black
(They don't really wanna fuck with us) The last lie you heard, this ain't that
This that, "I done made it out the gutter" shit
Nip told you "Fuck the middle man", I told you "Fuck a bitch"
Fuck wearin' their clothes, I wear my own shit
Ya'll can own ya'll label, I own my own, bitch!
Aye Nip, I remember all that game you taught me
Don't fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas, Adrien Broner
But secure the win though, don't let that game fold you
Cause when this game over, it's really game over
And all they do is play the game 'til this game over
And you be givin' game like a big brother
Mission, never let 'em take it from us

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Last time that I checked, it was 5 chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked, I was sellin' zones in the set
Make a quarter mill no sweat
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first get the money then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked
