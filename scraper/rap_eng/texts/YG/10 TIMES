[Verse 1]
Fuck the DA, fuck the P.O
Fuck the president, fuck the Po-po
They follow me, wanna keep me close
Try to, hold me back, let me go
I sip the drank, I sip the drank
Pick up the phone and call Michel'le
She hold me down, I gotta make the play
If that play don't get made, we're not okay
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see
A whole lotta lives depended on me
But I hold it down, I hold it down
I check in when I'm not in town
Put on a smile girl, put on a smile
It's a lot on my shoulders, I gotta balance it out
Put on a smile girl, put on a smile
I take care of you and that child

It's harder for a real nigga (hey)

[Verse 2]
Gotta go to the courthouse
Judge ain't giving a fuck, oww
My fingerprints is they evidence
What the fuck I'ma do now?
So hold me tight, hold me close
My lifestyle got me doin' the most
Fuck that, let's make a toast
The Lord keep us alive, he never take our soul
I'm prayin' up, I'm prayin' up
This a must that I can't sleep, I stay up
Pops told me to change up, but if I change up, they gonna say I changed up
When everybody depend on you
You got nobody to run to
You got nobody to come through, when they finally come through, you feel like fuck you

[Hook]
It's harder for a real nigga (hey)
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
