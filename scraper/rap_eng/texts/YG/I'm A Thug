[Chorus: YG]
If you're looking for me, nigga, come get me
Pu$haz Ink the label, yeah, they're my niggas
You know she keep her nails done, her weave spiffy
Take it to the house and get jiggy
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge

[Verse 1: YG]
Fresh off the block, I got work
And if you talking bout colors, well I got purp
The last girl I dated, that bitch got hurt
Put that on something -- nigga, that's on my turf
Riding in the whip, ri-riding in the whip
And if she ain't fucking, then she flying off a cliff
Nigga never sleep, nigga never eat shrimp
She heard a nigga faithful -- bitch, that's a myth
I'm bout to bring the coast back, bout to bring the coast back
I be burning bread, yep, nigga go and toast that
Taking niggas' bitches, better get your bitch Lojacked
Like a condom wrapper, nigga, get your ass tore back
One twenty on the dash, no seat belt
So motherfucking high, a nigga need help
Money over broke bitches, yeah a nigga mean that
That head was so good, a nigga felt it in his kneecaps

[Chorus: YG]
If you're looking for me, nigga, come get me
Pu$haz Ink the label, yeah, they're my niggas
You know she keep her nails done, her weave spiffy
Take it to the house and get jiggy
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Glock 40, posted in the field a cornerback
Middle of the summer, I be out there where the corner at
Started with a eight-ball, then I bought a quarter back
Put a price on your head, nigga, I could order that
Cocaine-selling two time felon
Y'all niggas telling, fuck around we crack your melon
All this kush I be inhaling, y'all niggas be jealous
Bad bitch with me, buying shoes like Cinderella
She gon fuck the whole team; I be on lean
Sipping on purp, me, my nigga Dean
Pigeon in the kitchen, fresh off the triple beam
We get straight down to that money, no ifs ands are in between
I be rolling, nigga I be rolling
In this Panamera, whip that bitch like it was stolen
Prezzie on my wrist, thirty racks all golden
And my neck all frozen; little nigga, I be holding, bitch

[Chorus: YG]
If you're looking for me, nigga, come get me
Pu$haz Ink the label, yeah, they're my niggas
You know she keep her nails done, her weave spiffy
Take it to the house and get jiggy
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge

[Verse 3: YG]
I got the strap cocked, right ready to go
I got your girl on my phone ready to ho
Y'all know niggas ain't fucking with me
Y'all know my nigga Mustard on the beat
I got the strap cocked, right ready to go
I got your girl on my phone ready to ho
Y'all know niggas ain't fucking with me
Y'all know my nigga Mustard on the beat

[Chorus: YG]
If you're looking for me, nigga, come get me
Pu$haz Ink the label, yeah, they're my niggas
You know she keep her nails done, her weave spiffy
Take it to the house and get jiggy
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
Nigga, I'm a thug, fuck the cops and the judge
