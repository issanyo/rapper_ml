[Verse 1: YG]
I'm a nasty nigga I do my stuff, girl you ain't even ask me to
You get the best sex from me when a nigga mad at you
Choke you out from the back, what's my name? Fuck up and trashed
She feel it in her rib cage, you know what to do
I'm my soso, take them lights off
Eat that pussy first, that's how I pop shit off
Scuba dive in you, need a new life in you
Bet you last for 4 minutes and 4 seconds when I'm in it, pussy killer

[Verse 2: JR Castro]
Bet you all up in your feelings right
You got so wet, oh
I hope you told your friends you didn't hide
Hop on this ship
Got that good shit, I want it, been waiting for it
She called her friends, but they ain't gon' join us
I came tonight, gave you the business
She fell in love, the only thing I remember

[Hook: JR Castro]
That shit go up, down, round, round
Do it like you supposed to do
That shit go up, down, round, round
This ain't nothing usual
Do it how you do
Do it how you do
Do it how you do

[Verse 3: Sevyn Streets]
You want that extra courage late at night
'Bout to break this roof, yeah
I tell my girls I got a boy
'Bout to leave with you
I got that good shit, know it, you ain't the only one want it
Back up what I say, no no this ain't an appointment
Cause I'm on your mind from midnight 'til morning
Need your concentration, just keep your eyes on it

[Hook: JR Castro & Sevyn Streeter]
That shit go up, down, round, round
Do it like you supposed to do
That shit go up, down, round, round
This ain't nothing usual
Do it how you do
Do it how you do
Do it how you do
