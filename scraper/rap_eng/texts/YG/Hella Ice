[Bridge x2]
Hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
Hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice

[Verse 1: Payroll Giovanni]
Walk in the club looking like a kingpin
Lame niggas got to tuck their whole piece in
Smelling like money, damn it, I'm reeking
Want to keep your ho then you should go ahead and leave then
Take a look at a motherfucking boss
Crucifix with the frost, the only time I get crossed
Try to rob me, fuck around and get chalked
Put a price on your life, fuck around and get bought
Invisible set, it's visible on my neck
The same set on the band, I'm the invisible man
OG's remembered well when I was flipping them grams
Now they glance at the watch and say you killing a man
That bitch you thinking is the one, just look twice
'D' is shit in the dark so I can look bright
Even independent, they was like, no peace sign
I was just rocking all the best shit dope could buy

[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]
My niggas rock hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
Whole clique, hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
My niggas rock hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
Whole clique, hell a ice, hella ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
My niggas rock hell a ice

[Verse 2 : YG]
I rock ice, get money, fuck bitches
Last nigga I knocked out got stitches
Try to rob me, getting popped with no witness
Drink so much liquor, probably got no kidneys
The OG's know me, shoot first before you get shot
That's what the OG's told me
I'm on the block shooting hell a Dodge
Hanging with my niggas like Vanilla Ice
Uh, 7/11 when I come out
Taking all your money until you run out
Run up in your house and make you run up
Those are things that happen when them niggas bring them guns out
Yo VVS' ain't VVS, why's your gold turning rose
Come to my coast so you can get the message
I'm onto these hoes

[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]
My niggas rock hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
Whole clique, hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
My niggas rock hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
Whole clique, hell a ice, hella ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
My niggas rock hell a ice

[Verse 3: HBK Kidd]
Hell a ice, diamonds so flooded in the Rollie
I can't even tell it right, I'm still the same nigga
Still live the ghetto life, I ain't mad
But these hoes think I'm pissed with this yellow ice
She see my bracelet, I'm fucking her
Got jewellery stores peeping because they want us as they customers
Your bitch say I'm a boss and you the weakest link
Bought her Don P, told we drink the drink
Hell a ice boys, call us the mob
Jesus piece, oh my God
You see a nigga shining, better close your eyes
Because if you keep staring, girl, you're going blind
Hell a ice, hell a ice
Niggas cold like I'm in the light, get it right
Hell a ice, bitch don't make me tell the price
Can't believe her eyes, I had to tell her like

[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]
My niggas rock hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
Whole clique, hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
My niggas rock hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
Whole clique, hell a ice, hella ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
My niggas rock hell a ice

[Bridge x2]
Hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
Hell a ice, hell a ice, bitch, hell a ice, hell a ice
