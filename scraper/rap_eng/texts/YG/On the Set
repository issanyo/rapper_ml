[Intro:]
I want you girl
Baby, I want you girl
Let that young G hit you
Let a YG get with you

[Verse 1:]
Light skin, slim fit, curly hair
Where's your climaxes girl? I'm tryna take you there
Rodell Drive, yeah, I'm just tryna take you there
She never had a orgasm, well I'm tryna take you there
She be with the one, two
She be down to fuck and kick it like Kung fu
She a bad bitch, she fuck the city up
She like Hurricane Sandy when she come through
Oh my, she give me butterflies
But fuck bein' shy, I'd rather be in them thighs
She know I'm a ride
Rappin' or not I'm at the crib
I told her drive through like Jack-in-the-Box
Girl... don't let me find out where your spot
Dick so good I have you actin' like somebody you not
Situation could only get realer
So you just be my bitch, and I'm a be your nigga

[Hook:]
I... put that on the set, girl, kissin' on your neck
Oh my, you like ooh, I...
If you respect yourself, I'm gon' give you your respect girl
I wanna mop you now, you be lovin' now
I wanna mop you now
I bring my spec
I wanna mop you now, you be lovin' now
I wanna mop you now
I bring my spec
I wanna mop you now, you be lovin' now
I wanna mop you now
I bring my spec
I wanna mop you now, you be lovin' now
I wanna mop you now
I bring my spec

[Verse 2:]
We got together, broke up and got together
She got me wonderin' who she fuckin' when we not together
Her friends ratchet, don't kick it with 'em
Cause they say the birds with the same feathers flock together
That insecure shit she don't like
That immature shit she don't like
We both got spendin' problems
I be spendin' money, she be tryna spend the night
I give her pipe like a plumber
Her ex went broke, aw fuck that's a bummer
We do numbers like 6-9
We be fuckin' when we break up
I ain't trippin', that pussy been mine
She need sex, I'm like "call me now"
1-800-I-DICK-IT-DOWN
She tryna wear my heart on her necklace
She don't wanna fuck the first night and I respect that

[Hook]
