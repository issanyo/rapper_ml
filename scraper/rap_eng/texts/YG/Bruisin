[Hook]
Back to the brans
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas

[Verse 1: Slim 400]
Bruisin' in my rag top on D's
Hitter on the front got the pistol on scrape
Whirl in the back and he rolling up a grape
Bout to hit the Shaw so we can knock us a B
Had to flash on a nigga then he skirted out
That's that L.A. shit, you know I'm talking about
Nigga I'm a rep where I'm from, ain't not bitching out
Make 'em lean like a cholo when this gun is out
My real vatos with the biz, I'm at they family's house
Sippin' on coronas on they couch when I'm thuggin' out
Slim fo' got hella clout, so what's this you talkin' bout?
It really mean nothing when I'm all they talk about
I really get dough and that's something you're not about
And me being broke that is something I won't allow, aye
Times get hard, got the world in my hands
European wheels headed back to the brans

[Hook]
Back to the brans
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm bruisin' down the brans in a benz
Just left the block I'm tryna make it to the 1-10
Red lights I don't fuck with them
Never wanna be a victim of a "Oh that's him"
Them yellow lights I zoom past them
Cause if I stop they got time to assume that's him
Them green lights, that mean everything a go
These hoes go, this money go like bullets out this .44
Summertime in Cali got it made so you strap it up
(ay ay bitch where you goin', hop in the car)
These niggas be stealing my appeal, I be mad as fuck
This swag I got is contagious
That's why I don't shake hands I dap it up
I ran to the block when they was trying to save me
My plan worked, I'm a million dollar baby
But fuck it, I'm bout to put the benz on D's
And you know I ain't lying when I put it on beats

[Hook]
Back to the brans
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas
Bruisin', bruisin', bruisin', bruisin'
Just me & my niggas

[Verse 3: Sad Boy Loko]
Bruisin' down the street in my six o
Sippin' on a michelada while my henny gets cold
You should know when I roll, G I'm up to something
Windows down system low, I ain't tryna bump it
Turn right cause a left might make you wait
On these streets it don't pause everyone's out to play
No rewind if you die, so I'm going fast forward
I was young bruisin' street looking over both shoulders
Nothing changed still bruise at the same block
Yes I paid for my rims, no they ain't hot
Driving in the ghetto, the streets I was raised in
Smoking getting high, like a goddamn Jamaican
3 girls side to side I could even pancake it
Leave holes in your face looking like Jason
Sippin' on my henny I can't even chase it
Ever try and wonder I will demonstrate it
Shit
