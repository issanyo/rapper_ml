[Chorus]
I met her in the club
Then I said wassup
I took her to the crib
And you know I fucked
Yeah I toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it
That's why I toot and boot it
She think I'm cute, she wanna have sex
Girl knock it off you know you can't have this
She think I'm cute, she wanna have sex
Girl knock it off you know you can't have this
And she told me run that, I told her run it
And she never seen a trick until she met my magic stick
Girl Imma pimp spit straight game never no shit
And after we did it she was walking with a limp
Bust it open leave it wet you know I leave it soaked
Who next I don't ever close, I stay open
I met her in the club, you know I was drunk
I asked her name and then I said I wanna fuck
And I'm YG and you know I fucked
And she fucked back like a little slut
And she fell in love ya
And she felt stupid 'cause you know
I toot it and boot it

[Chorus]
Girl let me toot that boot that stop actin' stupid
Acting like you don't know me like "who dat?"
Walked in the club with all fly thangs
I'm in the back girl you know where to find me
And I off top she think I'm cute
And she don't even wanna tell me what she wanna do
Its me and my crew her and her friends
And they all trying to leave with us when the club ends
And she toot it from the back and you know she made it clap
And you know I run it back like
Only for one night and she know I'm on like the switch on a light
Hey girl I can have you feelin' right
I can supply the pipe
Just make sure its tight
We can do it all day only for one night
And after that you gotta go
'Cause you ain't my wife

[Chorus]
I toot it to the left
And toot it to the right
Fuckin' with me
We gonna do it all night
I seen a bad bitch
I swing my hat back
And after I hit
I swung my bat
'Cause I toot it and boot it
And made her feel stupid
'Cause I toot it and boot it
And made her feel stupid

[Chorus]
