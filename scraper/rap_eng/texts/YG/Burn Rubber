[Intro: Joe Moses & DJ Mustard]
Turn it up slow

[Hook: Joe Moses]
I tell her, burn rubber on a fuck-nigga
Ol' pussy ass nigga no luck with him
Got a hunnid on bottles, club fuck with him
Keep dimes on up, no ducks with him
We got, bad bitches (bitches), only bad bitches (bitches)
Only out at my table (my table)
We're like, "Fuck niggas!" (fuck), "fuck pussy niggas" (fuck)
Niggas mad they ain't able

[Verse 1: Joe Moses, Joe Moses & DJ Mustard]
I'm in a grey Bentley, doin' like a buck fifty
Ten thousand, lookin' like I buck fifty
When the song come on do the ratchet
Keep rubber bands poppin' no practice
Got mollies on mollies, she actin'
But I only fuck with models and actress'
Fuck niggas, fuck fuck-niggas
We gettin' money, we don't fuck with you niggas
I'm like, burn rubber on a fake bitch
Your weave ain't right, you a snake bitch
When the song come on, they gon' hate this
Tell the DJ now bitch play this
I'm in a drop top Masi with the skirt on the scurt
Lookin' like a "G," I put that on the turf
For whatever it's worth, niggas soft as Nerf
And if you ain't gettin' money better go to church, huh

[Refrain: Joe Moses]
Huh
JM, huh
Squad

[Hook: Joe Moses & YG]

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm like, "Fuck niggas, fuck pussy niggas"
Pussies catch feeling' I don't trust pussy-niggas
Yuck bitch, you's a duck bitch
You the type a nigga see in traffic and duck bitch
Got a cousin that's rollin', got a bitch in the Hoovers
My big titty bitch get me free wings from Hooters
I got Porsches, that got horses
Got the plugs on drugs, nigga who need sources? Huh!
And I don't like the way you niggas act
And I don't like the way you niggas rap
And I don't like the way you say you niggas trap
But it take a year to pay a nigga back
And I can put that on e'rythang
VVS diamond, jeweler put that on e'rythang
I'm from where gang-bangin's not an option
He asked me where I'm from
I told him "Nigga, I'm from Bompton!"
Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga
Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga
Nigga, nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga
Nigga, nigga I'm from Bompton!

[Hook: Joe Moses]
I tell her, burn rubber on a fuck-nigga
Ol' pussy ass nigga no luck with him

Keep dimes on up, no ducks with him
We got, bad bitches (bitches), only bad bitches (bitches)
Only out at my table (my table)
We're like, "Fuck niggas!" (fuck), "fuck pussy niggas" (fuck)
Niggas mad they ain't able

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
I'm in a, Greystone on a Sunday
And when your boy hit the club bet they know me
YSL with the motherfuckin' rollie
And if your girl wanna fuck better show me
Twenty deep with the motherfuckin' homies
Got Colony jumpin' on a Monday
Got Supper club going on a Tuesday
I fuck a basketball wife with a booty
I might, wife the bitch with a few gifts
Know some Hollywood bitches who can suck dick
And if you put them on tape, she'll love it
Fucked a couple big stars, I don't judge it
I'm nasty, I kiss her in public
To keep it real, on God I don't trust it
I'm just thuggin', no lovin'
No roses just fuck, fuckin', huh

[Refrain: Joe Moses]
We're like, "Fuck niggas! Fuck pussy niggas"
We're like, "Fuck niggas! Fuck pussy niggas"

[Hook: Joe Moses]
I tell her, burn rubber on a fuck-nigga
Ol' pussy ass nigga no luck with him
Got a hunnid on bottles, club fuck with him
Keep dimes on up, no ducks with him
We got, bad bitches (bitches), only bad bitches (bitches)
Only out at my table (my table)
We're like, "Fuck niggas!" (fuck), "fuck pussy niggas" (fuck)
Niggas mad they ain't able
