[Hook: Que]
For the cheese like nachos
I'll pull up on a nigga pronto
Ridin' for the guapo, it's just me and my vato
If money ain't the convo, tell me what the hell you call for
As soon as the block close, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos
It's just me and my vatos, it's just me and my vatos

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm talkin' bout bald head, tatted up ese's
CV70's in Frente
Hold up, they ain't never on that bitch shit
Fuck a chicklet, they on the corner with that biscuit
Called 'em up like (brrp), nigga need that (brrp)
Said that money good, my vato pulled up like (skrrt)
He ain't playin' wit' it, that pistol permanent, he stayin' wit' it
Yeah, he tryna live his dreams, so he layin' wit' it
And I helped him cross the border, now he finally seen his daughter
And his vato just got shot up, he hit the block and all you heard was
Blocka, blocka, blocka, blocka!

[Verse 2: Word Play]
Don't fuck with Pablo, unless you wanna get your head blown
Barcodes of hydros, while he loading up his pistol
Pablo a Capo, he a killa, you don't know?
He'll have your blood splattered on the wall like Van Gogh
If you scared, exito, we holding barrels of blanco
Moving weight around like he do the hammer throw
Hold me an elbow, lo necesito pronto
If it ain't about the guapo muhfucka bye ho
Fumamos árboles todo el otoño
Porque sin drogas, no hay paraíso!

[Hook: Que]

[Verse 3: Que]
Headed to the guapo, it's just me and my vato
Ridin' wit' the heater, in the winter, wit' the top gone
For the cheese like a nacho, I'll knock the beef out your taco
When it come to Velveeta, I do not play bout my peso
It's just me and my vato, we in a Porsche on Rodeo
Tryna find us a J-Lo to paint a face like it's make-up
If you play with the queso, them bullets flyin' rapido
Call my vatos like andale go and pick up ladrillos
My compadres, my partners, aka my amigos
And they play with gambino, don't touch it if it poquito
If it ain't bout guapo, lil' nigga don't call
Cause I don't wanna talk, fall back, nigga, pause
I don't play about my vatos
When it come to 'em, give a nigga that trabajo
