[Verse 1: YG]
She say she like ballers, she say she like dick
She say she like girls, that don't even make sense
She say she like the balls, say shit fucking
She supposed to be mine, see that's why you can't trust em
I'm tryna get some head though, bitch what it is?
If you ain't with that, then it is what it is
I'm tatted on my ribs, yeah I'm tatted on my neck
You be throwing up the liquor I be throwing up the set
I'm bout my money, I'm bout my cheese
Still eating niggas D's, Big Macs with no cheese
All you rap niggas tryina sound like me
I hear you niggas talking but it don't sound like beef
I'm so mayo, the real definition
Yeah I hope you niggas ain't gotta pot to piss in
That was 16, but I'm a keep going
You ain't made enough yet bitch keep hooing
You be deep throating why you actin innocent
I ain't tryina be friend, I just want the benefits
Why you worry bout, who hittin this?
I'm out front of your house, hittin' it in the whip
You niggas getting chip, I'm playing chips
You got your mind on me, I got minds on rich
Give it up, give it up, slide like this
Rolex and the chain might blind your bitch

[Hook:]
I woke up, this morning
Like I'm a grind late night till the morning
Though, being broke was boring
So I grind late night till the morning
The only thing that a nigga need to know
I gotta get dough, I gotta get dough
The only thing that a nigga need to know
I gotta get dough, I gotta get dough

[Verse 2: TeeCee4800]
Ah, better watch how you pussy niggas act
The only time it's safe is when it's getting cracked
Yeah I'm real flashy, ball like an athlete
Burner to the dome, ah, make it nasty
Don't test me, this ain't college
A bitch get flipped on, I call her knowledge
Make the bitch run, make the bitch come
I'm in a 2 seater, having a three some
Ah, hey, they say I'm acting brand new
They say I went Hollywood, shit its prolly true
Ah, tree tops to the schools
Fucking with the border rules
Never slipping never catch me in the house shoes
Got the jays in my feet, got the jays in the streets
Got the jays at the dough
If I ever gave the bitch money she got it off the floor

[Hook:]
I woke up, this morning
Like I'm a grind late night till the morning
Though, being broke was boring
So I grind late night till the morning
The only thing that a nigga need to know
I gotta get dough, I gotta get dough
The only thing that a nigga need to know
I gotta get dough, I gotta get dough

[Verse 3: YG]
Yeah, I do that with my eyes closed
I'm a thug, I still read the bible
Praying for survival, they ask me why I got the strap
Shit, I'm tryina stay alive bro
Yeah, hit me on the text
Told her we together, fucking told her she my ex
Pocket full of benjes, so nigga I've been G
Stop stealin my swag nigga, I'm stan G
Riding in a Benz and you niggas don't offend me
I don't give a fuck if you was a 110 deep
We can talk about money cause I got that
Popped the homie same night, we gonn pop back
Ah, and I don't rap I state facts
When I get rich, I promise to stay black
The only thing I'm giving a stake back
It's puttin my homies on, and giving a state crack

[Hook:]
I woke up, this morning

So I grind late night till the morning
The only thing that a nigga need to know
