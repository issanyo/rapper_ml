[Hook (4x)]
Bend that shit over
Then make it clap

[Verse 1]
Bend that shit over, then make it clap
I bust a nut, then take a nap
That pussy be fat
Long as the stomach and a dick in her tummy
I make her have a stomach ache
Pussy, ass 'n titties, yeah I need all that
You say you love me on the texts, I deleted all that
Ass like J.Lo angel with the halo
Niggas act hard but in the hood they ain't got no say so
Feeling froggy lee, nigga hit your kermit
See you in the hood, you hit the sherman
When niggas whip that dick up bitches get nervous
Treat that pussy like an enemy, bitch I murk it
Bitch shake that ass, bitch shake that ass
Nigga getting old pussy wanna rip that ass
Bend over, get naked
I paid for it then I ate it

[Hook (8x)]

[Verse 2]
Said she drunk too much liquor
Said she drunk too much liquor
She don't fuck with her ex
She said she drunk too much liquor
Said she drunk too much liquor
She don't fuck with her ex nigga
Eyyy, what that shit do though
Say that pussy bomb I say do they smell good though
We act our state cause we from the hood though
Your bitch ugly wouldn't fuck her if I could though
But if that pussy shaved I hit
If that pussy shaved I hit
I finna bust her then oh shit
If she bad I ain't pulling out
If she bad I ain't pulling out
She telling me to pull it out I'm like nah bitch!
Bitch shake that ass
Nigga's getting no pussy wanna rip that ass
Bend over, get naked
She said I nutted quick, I said bitch I was wasted

[Hook (8x)]

[Bridge]
All my ladies, put your hands where you're to
Pick it up, pick it up for a stack now
All my ladies, put your hands where you're to
Pick it up, pick it up for a stack now
All my ladies, put your hands in the air
Now do it, do it, do it like you don't care
All my ladies, put your hands in the air
And do it, do it, do it like you don't care
