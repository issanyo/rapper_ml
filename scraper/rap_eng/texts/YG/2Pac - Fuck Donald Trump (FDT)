[Intro: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Fuck Trump, you fat motherfucker
Fuck Clinton, you fat bitch

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Fuck Donald Trump! (x8)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Y'know you really can't say that ya blame niggas
Fuck being tame, set a flame, time to aim triggers
2Pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the Constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at each other
That's my motherfuckin' brother, so Trump, nigga
Run for cover
And other bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack And I don't drink St. Ides
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin' TEC-9
They know they scared to see us sober
Stop drinking King Cobra, and niggas'll take the world over
It's all up to you
Blame the Korean, blame the Jews

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Fuck Donald Trump! (x8)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nothing but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and OOOH
You can't fuck with the crew


[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Fuck Donald Trump! (x8)

[Outro: 2Pac]
Oaktown!
Ignant, that's what it is! You ignant!
Ignant, that's what's wrong with you!
Ignant, motherfucker you ignant!
