[Intro]
Yeah
Uh
Gorilla

[Verse 1]
(Cooking soul) good morning good night
I can’t stay if you don’t f*ck right if you don’t get money
I don’t get you like a pedestrian (I can’t hit you)
I stay prayed up I’m chained up
And that money only thing that entertain us
I used to smoke to take the pain away
Now it’s 10 case we like gang a dang
Good Lord I think all these hoes I f*cked
Bullet wounds in these hoes I trust
N*gga’s going to hate that’s okay
Friends turn fake when you start eating cake
Yeah this sh*t n*gga’s going turn n*gga’s don’t listen
But n*gga’s gon learn n*gga’s in the hood
Turn that shern they rather be selling that hitting that shern
I ain’t trying to be the one that you look at like dominating
I ain’t trying to be the one that have potential out the click
But I ended up being that bomb n*gga(talking grid)

[Hook]
Talking grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

[Verse 2]
Smoked out up late can’t sleep for f*ck sake my bitch bad my weed good
We balling out like we should I’m hustling babe I love you babe
But we ain’t got trust and all we do is f*ck cause all I want to do is f*ck (f*ck you crazy)

[Hook]
Grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

Stack more pop bro no dance one hit and I’m going back
Be doing our thing so f*ck ya’ll don’t trust ya’ll might bust ya’ll my downfall
That grayhound that bad bitch I stay on bay n*gga used to play on
