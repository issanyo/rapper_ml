[Intro: Yella Beezy]
Don't wanna hurt nobody
Don’t wanna hurt nobody
Don't wanna hurt nobody
Don't wanna, hey

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
It’s safe to say that I be ballin' on you scrubs
Walk up in the club, pocket full of dubs
It's safe to say that I be rockin' all these shows
Pocket full of dough, pockets always swole
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy, yay-ayy, yay-ayy
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy, yay-ayy, yay-ayy
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy

[Verse 1: Yella Beezy]
Used to move the weight, breakin' down the yay
Every day I’m gettin’ money, tryna make a play
Serve a nigga ho, got him just the other day
Choppers extra clip, I'ma let it rip
Swangin’ through the VIP, my niggas smoke a whole zip
If they tryna fuck up on, bring them hoes here
Party pack of pills, baby, you can't no lip, hey
She get cold here, baby, tell 'em what you on
I'm headed to the teller, baby, if you tryna bone
Probably want feelings with you early in the morn’
Her body rockin', knockin', yeah I be in my zone

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
It's safe to say that I be ballin' on you scrubs
Walk up in the club, pocket full of dubs
It's safe to say that I be rockin' all these shows
Pocket full of dough, pockets always swole
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy, yay-ayy, yay-ayy
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy, yay-ayy, yay-ayy
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy

[Verse 2: Yella Beezy]
Don't wanna hurt nobody
Baby tryna murk your body
Bend that over, jerk your body
Throw it back, yeah bae, strip your body
La-di-da-di-dah, ayy
She smokin', she probably high, ayy
Slurpin' on me fire, I'ma beat it 'til it's dry, ayy
Nigga, bang bang, I'ma skeet into the sky, ayy
My phone ring ring, say they need it right now
You thirsty, take a sip, hey, pat it on your lip, hey
Dallas up in here, out in Cali with the drip
Say she got some butt shots, told her go'n and get some hips
Tryna get my passport, baby let's take a trip

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
It's safe to say that I be ballin' on you scrubs
Walk up in the club, pocket full of dubs
It's safe to say that I be rockin' all these shows
Pocket full of dough, pockets always swole
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy, yay-ayy, yay-ayy
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy, yay-ayy, yay-ayy
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy

[Verse 3: YG]
It's safe to say I be fuckin' on your bitch
Dick all on her lips, right there where you kiss
It's safe to say I'm in YSL for sure
Louis V for sure, had to leave Polo alone
It's safe to say, YG got that bang
One call leave you slain, your face on the shirt they paint
It's safe to say if I slide up with your bae
Today must be the day, you find out she wasn't really bae (Hey)
Fuck playin' safe, motherfucker, I play hardball
Fuckin' bein' bool, motherfucker, I come for all y'all
Fuck gettin' work, motherfucker, I'd rather call off
The house ain't even safe, nigga, I had to cop a sawed-off

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
It's safe to say that I be ballin' on you scrubs
Walk up in the club, pocket full of dubs
It's safe to say that I be rockin' all these shows
Pocket full of dough, pockets always swole
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy, yay-ayy, yay-ayy
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy, yay-ayy, yay-ayy
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy
(Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna hurt nobody)
It's safe to say, ayy-yay-ayy
(Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna hurt nobody)
