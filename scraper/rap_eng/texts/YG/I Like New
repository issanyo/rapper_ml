[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
I ain't gotta talk about bitches keep it quiet
Yeah I move in silence
I can hear them talking and they talking say it louder
Can't hear em' from my tower, smoking on some sour
Let these haters talking, only talking hater
Ridin' in the Tesla tryna pull my dress up
But I ain't with that old back seat been done shit
Chanel will run shit
Kept my crew munchin'
Certified chick, bad bitches in motion
I like new, I like new

[Verse 2: Chanel West Coast]
Stop it, your clothes Hot Topic
Your flow's hot garbage
I've had it keep it quiet but sometimes I gotta drop it
Fuck your hidden motives imma sip mimosas
Chilling in the villa in Anguilla getting loaded
What's the commotion, new shit is my motion
Sick of all the whack ass music they promoting
When we just hoping, waitin' for the moment
But I'm a stay focused, hope you notice that
