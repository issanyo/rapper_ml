Look bitch you been hanging with my enemies
My house got too many piece
You might try to steal from me
Might try to send some niggas to kill for me
You been plotting on the low
How I know? My homie told me so
Damn, that's wrong, damn bitch you so wrong
I'm the nigga never loving these bitches
Never trusting these bitches only fucking these bitches
These bitches be having like four or five niggas
They be fucking on these bitches so I'm fucking on these bitches
Told me you a classy bitch
I fucked you a nasty bitch
'Posed to be loyal, goddamn I need a Mexican
Goddamn I need a Mexican

Bitch you not to be

Bitch what my name is?
Where your grandma stay bitch?
Y'all tryna be famous
Who you tryna play bitch?
Who you fucked on the A-List?
Who you told not to say shit?
Bitch I don't fuck with you, I don't fuck with you
Same old trust issues
I'mma do what I'm accustomed to
If it's burnt at the bottom nigga cut the juice
I don't trust you bitches
I don't even trust the ones with good intentions
Soon as you show them love they burn they bridges
Nigga if we talking drugs that bitch impress me
Coming new like its renovated
All my hunnids come blue got them ventilated
Bitches come when they think a nigga crossed over
I don't trust no bitch far as I can throw her, no
