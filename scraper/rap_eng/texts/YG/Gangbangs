You a bitch nigga, you a
If the homie shoot, you'll prolly' snitch nigga
You ain't runnin' shit nigga

Skate a bitch dick, now the bitch havin' mood swings
Walking down roads crans looking like I stole something

But I'm a blood, so I'll Suge Knight that nigga

[Verse 2: TeeCee4800]
Gang bang
Slap a bitch nigga out to get a grip
Flip a brick, hit a lick, niggas out in hoodvich
Never broke, 'less I knock a nigga out and I kept the phone
Im a crip, but I love a redbone
Town swag, cashed out swag
My niggas we don't dream, but we put it in the bag
Everything fast, ever since my first pass
I ain't never look back, when a nigga was in the back
No I'm not number one but I stay with the mac
My nigga bust front, we ain't gotta bust back
Talkin' all that shit, my niggas we pullin' triggers
You don't want the vaca', but y'all all eat a nigga, what?
Uh, you niggas is straight bitches, you niggas is straight marks, straight up snitches
My niggas is all with it, staright up crippin'
My niggas is slappin' bitches
'Cus we straight up pimpin
