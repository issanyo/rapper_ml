[Chorus]
Aw, yeah, throw your neighborhoods in the air like you don't care
Aw, yeah, wave your neighborhoods in the air if you don't care
Aw, yeah, throw your neighborhoods in the air like you don't care
Aw, yeah, wave your neighborhood in the air if you don't care

[Verse]
Nigga, I'm from west-side Balifornia
With niggas who ain't paparazzi pullin' cameras on ya
It be like 4-5 in the mornin'
Your bitch gettin' fucked and shit gettin' stolen
We wear checked Ts and [?]
Buy designer just to floss, but really don't care
An' everybody know somebody with that [?]
Them [?] niggas be OT, why you think we on here?
Everybody got they hussle, everybody got they uncle who got straps
And got they back when homies don't come through
Plus, the plug taxin' you like Uncle Sam
An' your other plug outta jail, but he just got jammed
Told my pops the streets turned me to a man
He told me, "Stay out the streets, the streets where I got my [?]"
And on my street, I'm the man
Another victim of the culture, damn, damn, damn

[Chorus]
Aw, yeah, throw your neighborhoods in the air like you don't care
Aw, yeah, wave your neighborhoods in the air if you don't care
Aw, yeah, throw your neighborhoods in the air like you don't care
Aw, yeah, wave your neighborhood in the air if you don't care

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Aw, yeah, throw your neighborhoods in the air like you don't care
Aw, yeah, wave your neighborhoods in the air if you don't care
Aw, yeah, throw your neighborhoods in the air like you don't care
Aw, yeah, wave your neighborhood in the air if you don't care

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Aw, yeah, throw your neighborhoods in the air like you don't care
Aw, yeah, wave your neighborhoods in the air if you don't care
Aw, yeah, throw your neighborhoods in the air like you don't care
Aw, yeah, wave your neighborhood in the air if you don't care
