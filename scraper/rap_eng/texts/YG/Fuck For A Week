I fuck for a week yeah(x2)

[Verse 1: Mike Jay]
She say her skin come out in the summer
I told her go ahead , bust it open
In the pool making out with a model
I think I’m bout to tell her that I love her
Get on your knees girl drink this blue dot
Take your shirt off let me see you wild out
You’re from the A girl,or Miami
From the D to the Bay can I grab it?

[Hook]
Let me know if you’re a freak
Cause it’s 6 in the morning
And you know a nigga feeling horny
Let me know if you’re a freak
Cause it’s 6 in the morning
And you know a nigga feeling horny
I fuck for a week
If you a hood chick, with an ass so thick turn around
I fuck for a week
We could turnup, I know damn well that you down
I fuck for a week
I fuck for a week
If you a freak girl
Then let’s take this up to the house

[Verse 2: YG]
I beat the pussy, hold up
I ain’t even tripping
And I eat the pussy
Her boyfriend was a mark
Made her leave the pussy
I hit it from the back
And wasn't even looking
Now stop moving baby holdup
I like girls they don't like me
Cause when I finally fuck em it excites me
Naw I ain't ratchet
Hit it with my shirt on
Had her pussy juices on my white tee
You ain't a real man if you don't eat it up
That's how you get your wifey took
Tell you a hundred reasons why we should fuck
I probably should write me a book
I fuck for a week
Never pay for it cause I’m cheap
Where Dre at, I fuck around and pay for that
Her mama probably tell her I’m too hood for her
Like a meal from mickeydees I ain’t good for her

[Verse 3: Mike Jay]
What’s happenin my baby
Tell me your down or what?
Look like you were marathons I got the stamina
Telling me that you wanna take the whole thang
Then you might as well get down on your knees
Shots of this blue dot 
Take your shirt off let me see you wild at
You’re form LA girl,or Toronto
Show me some on the way to the condo

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
Don’t trip I just met a new bitch number one
Number 1 with the bullet ever sense you slipped
Too Short, it’s just me and two chicks
Probably turn these hoes up and make them both do tricks
Have some 8 inch heels with nothing on
You say you wanna get your money on
I know, you’re just a little nasty freak
I put you in the game
But you ain’t last a week

[Hook]
