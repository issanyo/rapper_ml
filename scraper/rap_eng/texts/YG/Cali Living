I got my top down in my whip
Her hair blowing in the wind
I got my shades on cause I'm bent
She roll it up with no stem
I got my Louis bag duffled up
Fuck with the squad and throw it up
I got my top down speakers bump
See me when I pull it up

Gucci bag with the Louis belt
You know I keep the Glock by the stash on the shelf
Ya money too short nigga yous a elf
