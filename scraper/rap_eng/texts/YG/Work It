[Hook: Tashan Stewart]
Oh, you looking like the right type
You know I can beat it up, girl, fight night
I go hard, got that booty going night night
And we gon' work it out 'til we get it right, right
Oh, let me see you work it, babe
I just wanna see you work it, baby
Let me see you work it, babe
I just wanna see you work it, baby

[Verse 1: Mike Darole]
I wanna see you work, girl, work it on me
I know what you came for, I got that OT
Shawty 'bout business, so she keep it lowkey
And she love to get high when I roll that OG
I got a saw with the D game
She got me sprung like T-Pain
We can run it back like the weed play
Finna mix it up like a DJ

[Hook: Tashan Stewart]
Oh, you looking like the right type
You know I can beat it up, girl, fight night
I go hard, got that booty going night night
And we gon' work it out 'til we get it right, right
Oh, let me see you work it, babe
I just wanna see you work it, baby
Let me see you work it, babe
I just wanna see you work it, baby

[Verse 2: YG]
I such a sucker for pretty bitches and pedicure toes
VVS diamonds and all expensive ass clothes
You look better in private when the lights down low
I told her go with the lights and when the lights down low
Are you still, are you a freak?
She only fuck with niggas with money, she ain't cheap
I told her work like a 9 to 5
She ain't a hook up but she do it for the dollar signs

[Hook: Tashan Stewart]
Oh, you looking like the right type
You know I can beat it up, girl, fight night
I go hard, got that booty going night night
And we gon' work it out 'til we get it right, right
Oh, let me see you work it, babe
I just wanna see you work it, baby
Let me see you work it, babe
I just wanna see you work it, baby

[Bridge: Mike Darole]
Girl work it all on me
Come work it all on me
Go and work it all on me
Girl work it all on me
Girl work it all on me
Come work it all on me
Go and work it all on me
Girl work it all on me

[Hook: Tashan Stewart]
Oh, you looking like the right type
