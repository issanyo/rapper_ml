I'd die for my muh fuckin niggas
Til that day, I survive for my muh fuckin niggas
Any place, any time I send orders to my hittas
First state to 815, hit em up hope 2Pac wit you
Cuz you need a holy ghost, 9 knives, a couple scriptures
3 disciples, and a God if you thinking that you winning
I ain't playing, I LeBron on them haters that be bitchin'
Can't stand the Miami heat then get the fuck up out the kitchen
I'm just sayin, I ain't lying when Im saying that I'm killing
Keep praying, it's a crime when I walk into the building
I lose change all the time it ain't nothing to a villain
So if she say she a dime tell her I ain't got no feelings
Yeah, I'm hot you can tell it in the winter
When she fall, she get sprung
Some are rats master splinter
I don't trust em
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
Unless that chick bad, she not allowed all up in my zone, Lavon ho!
