[Intro]

[Hook]
West side 4 fingaz, hoes feening I don't want them
We got weed, bring the swishers so
Break them down and roll em hoes

[Verse 1: YG]
I told them "break them down yeah roll em"
These hoes ain't ours we stole them
If the bitch ain't fucking, I kick her off my team like Odom
Yeah I'm popping like script soda
Pay for 711 when I'm rolling up
Motherfuck being sober
I'm So high I'm at the solar
I got bars like granolas
My pretty bitch is bi polar
Her attitude stank like it got an odor, so "fuck you, pay me bitch" that's What I told her
So much paper I need a folder
I'm the definition of vulgar
Drug, yeah I sold them
My nuts, when I walk I hold them
Got more plugs than a tub when you tryna set the water
09' summer I was listening to The Carter
Crack Cocaine, yeah nigga I go harder
Send a parrot hood in town, I could preach your order
Nigga copying the flow, (yep x2) kinda soda
They just trying to be like a nigga from California
Fuck with me bitch, I rep California
I beat that pussy up till' that pussy out of order
Pushaz Ink is my label, they're my niggas, that's my company
This ain't no "sissy role", no "Lollipop" shit my nigga sucka-free
Best believe she packed with a Whole lotta ass, if she fuck with me
I'm charging 7 thousand 5 hundred for a verse, pay me nigga ain't nothing free
