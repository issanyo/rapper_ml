[Hook: Konan]
I don't even know what I did last night
Looked at my phone, said quarter past five
Bottles and sparklers, models and dancers
Tell your girlfriend stop calling my line
I don't even know what I did last night
Looked at my phone, said quarter past five
Bottles and sparklers, models and dancers
Tell your girlfriend stop calling my line
I don't even know, even know

[Verse 1: Konan]
Gold bottles on the table
White girls want a interracial
They heard about the horses in the engine
Got these bitches unstable
In school we had the Pradas
Now it's red Balenciagas
Walked in and do a Kanye on niggas
Bitch, you ain't got the answers
I'm not your man, don't stress me
Fuck buddy? I could be your bestie
Said she wanna lie down
Don't get make-up on my bed sheets
Come and step into my office
Should be honored that I offered
Smurf came in with the machine on him
He didn't get it from Florence, I don't even know

[Hook: Konan]
I don't even know what I did last night
Looked at my phone, said quarter past five
Bottles and sparklers, models and dancers
Tell your girlfriend stop calling my line
I don't even know what I did last night
Looked at my phone, said quarter past five
Bottles and sparklers, models and dancers
Tell your girlfriend stop calling my line
I don't even know, even know

[Verse 2: Krept]
Gold chains lookin' icey
Boy, hold onto your wifey
Yeah we both got Instagram
But you ain't nothin' like me
In the club, Konan, YG
I don't even need no I.D
She asked me if it's Gucci that I'm wearing
I said bitch it might be
Why these girls so obsessive?
Why she get the wrong impression?
Ain't even my girlfriend
Why you wanna see my texts?
Rappers holler for a feature
But we don't wanna do that either
With a sexy senorita
Screaming out Krep and she ain't talking 'bout a sneaker

[Hook: Konan]
I don't even know what I did last night
Looked at my phone, said quarter past five
Bottles and sparklers, models and dancers
Tell your girlfriend stop calling my line
I don't even know what I did last night
Looked at my phone, said quarter past five
Bottles and sparklers, models and dancers
Tell your girlfriend stop calling my line

[Verse 3: YG]
Tequila  shots to the head
So I don't remember half of the shit I just said
I put that molly in a avion
Then asked if I can fuck, she said yeah
Damn she said it so aggressive
She ain't had sex in a long time, she stressin'
So I give her this D, it was so good
Had to tell that bitch stop calling me
It's a movie when we pull up
You know it's over when I pull out
Tell me what's beef when you got a grill?
That's a mah'fuckin' cookout
I'm in the club two-steppin'
Looking like I'm holding my dick, but no, that's my weapon
It's YG, I'm from that west side
They don't fuck with me cause they know I'm with the extras

[Hook: Konan]
I don't even know what I did last night
Looked at my phone, said quarter past five
Bottles and sparklers, models and dancers
Tell your girlfriend stop calling my line
I don't even know what I did last night
Looked at my phone, said quarter past five
Bottles and sparklers, models and dancers
Tell your girlfriend stop calling my line
I don't even know, even know
