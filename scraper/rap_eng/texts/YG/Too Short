[Intro: Too $hort]

I used to have a lot of bitches straight down for me
Doing anything I said even ho in the streets

[Verse 1: YG]

Daytime shift
He a record(?) nigga he gon' learn quick
Can't see behind the tints(?)
When I'm riding down the blade
Tryna knock a nigga bitch
I ain't playing with no bitch man
Says she got a nigga but he bitch made
But I'mma show her how to get paid
To the shop get some photos of the bitch made

[Hook: YG]

Too $hort I got game for a bitch
Hoes come every time I hit the strip
(Bitch)I let 'em know it ain't shit
When I'm riding down the blade
Tryna knock a nigga bitch
X2

[Verse 2: YG]

Too short I got game for a bitch
Smart car I get brain in the whip
She suck me like I got a lemonade on my dick
Young Kunta Kinte, I got chains and whips
I'm in the bay getting paper, riding in the scraper
Don't ask no questions, I ain't doing no favors
Bitch, I go hard on the ho
You can get punched off and go hard on the row
Talking that shit, I'm like bitch shut up
Ever love a bitch, I'm like nigga never
Uhh, and these niggas bitch made
I been fucking bitches since the sixth grade
I'm just tryna get paid, sharper than a switchblade
Freshass fade with the brand new J's
I pop a nigga quick and knock a nigga bitch
No hands in that pussy on my Waka Flocka shit, ooh

[Hook]

[Bridge: YG]
My bitch goin' x4
Too $hort taught I had to get the cash for me
Let me knock your bottom bitch now she(now she) selling laps for me

X2

[Verse 3: YG]

Time to get the bitch going
Started off showing now the bitch hoeing
On the iPad had to get the ad out
Backpage, get the rip(?), post it
She a five star bitch now
Prime-time, knocking four or five chicks now
Pussy niggas tryna knock a nigga bitch down
Let me show 'em how I get down

[Hook]

[Outro: Too $hort]

But I'm a dog and I dog my broads
Gorilla pimping, driving four door cars
