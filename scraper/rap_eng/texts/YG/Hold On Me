[Hook: Lex Aura]
Shawty trynna throw it back all night
She know I got the plug for the right price
Pull up in the whip man it's off white
I'm ten hoes deep in that off white
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the mula really got a hold on me

[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Yeah
I'm livin' life like we ain't promised tomorrow
Lotta dope smoked, lotta lotta gelato
Hundred band dance like niggas just hit the lotto
Got a greasy kid just to get in the condo
Backhand a bitch for tryna bilk me with a condom
I can tell he ain't a gansta blood goofy with the llama
Big tymin', fifty thousand in diamonds that's on my mama
Cautious when approaching a problem, there go a problem
You ain't 'bout a comma, then we ain't nothing in common
If you ain't 'bout a comma, then we ain't nothing in common
Still yokin' a Honda with expired tags on it
Bought a crate of yiki's throw me whatever you had on it
Yeah, I fell off but baby I'm back on it
Yeah, I fell off but baby I'm back on it
I really think the money got a hold on me
I'm tryna convince her that she should hoe for me

[Hook: Lex Aura]
Shawty tryna throw it back all night
She know I got the plug for the right price
Pull up in the whip man it's off white
I'm ten hoes deep in the off white
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the mula really got a hold on me

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I think the money really got a hold on me
I followed the code OGs told to me
And the game was given, it wasn't sold to me
These hoes give it up to me because they owe it to me
I came up fully, I'm in a different bracket
Five bands for the leather, I'm in a different jacket
Money tall as Shaquille, I just been tryna stack it
Play me the beat and I kill, I'm trying to attack it
This game is too easy, I do this shit in my sleep
New York City, we mobbin', I hit the club twenty deep
Cashin' out when I feel like, Gerald never been cheap
It's not that serious fam, I swear it isn't that deep, uh
I swear it was perfect timing
If you ain't 'bout a comma, then we ain't nothing in common
The homies in black hoodies and beanies, they hella mobby
From Sac to the Bay, yeah you know that I fuck with Mozzy
Yee!

Shawty tryna throw it back all night

Pull up in the whip man it's off white
I'm ten hoes deep in the off white
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the mula really got a hold on me

[Verse 3: YG]
Yeah I think this money really got a hold on me
Niggas can't get a hold of me
Now them niggas talk low on me
Fuckin right I changed wit 2 Chainz, used to be broke homie
Now I'm bossed up, Louis V., bossed up
Ferragamo, Benihana, every night I'm bossed up
My lifestyle awesome, this is how it 'posed to be
I don't believe in luck, my blessings really got a hold on me
Money ain't controllin' me, but money is controllin' me
The money call I stop it all, no second guess I get the green
Devils get up off of me, help me get them off of me
I call these hoes, sluts and bitches, and I drink up all of it
My mama said don't let the money make your head bigger
I'm cocky as fuck and I don't fuck with niggas
And I don't trust these bitches, ever since the word 'gold digger'
My homie fell in love, I told him "No nigga, no nigga"

[Hook: Lex Aura & YG]
Shawty tryna throw it back all night (but he ain't listen)
She know I got the plug for the right price (oh)
Pull up in the whip man it's off white (400)
I'm ten hoes deep in the off white (400)
I think the money really got a hold on me
I think the money really got a hold on me (this money nigga)
I think the money really got a hold on me (shit will fuck up your life, but it's nice)
I think the mula really got a hold on me
