[Intro: Slim 400]
Lord, what we got is real (Yup, this all blassick)
Yeah, and you're the only one that can judge me (Know that)
Serving in these streets ain't right, It is what it is
So what we doin' what we doin' so what
Don't judge me speak my name
I'm dancin', baby
Slim 400 baby, lets go

[Hook: Peryon]
I twist my fingaz on the corner
Sell crack, cocaine & marijuana
Ski mask red rags & California
Piru Piru
I swang through the streets with all my partners
Pimp hard charging fee to all the boppers
Hundred round .223's inside the chopper
Piru piru

[Verse 1: Slim 400]
Back then they was fakin' it
Niggas knew they it was, and it was Bompton
Same shit I was I'm spitting 'till this day
That's shout the word out to baby Trey
We speaking on the real one
Better state the facts or don't say nothing
That's true as can be
& and I'mma keep that foreign, and on Bompton P on Spruce street
I ain't never had to fake it
Its a roll to play you should see it&, nigga
You ain't never even heard of that
(Aw shit nigga, you better listen to Nip nigga)
How you gettin' money how you stackin'?
Who your favorite artist, how you rappin'?
(Shit B's been fucking with C's nigga, you ain't learn a lesson from anything)
Been putting down I done earn mine
Two shells and done did some time
Like why? Nigga fuck you
And that's really him
Now recording me and him in the studio (Wiz)
Balling out at the Squad meet. (Obama)
Pulling out in all blassik shit
My favorite color been burgundy

[Hook: Peyron]
I twist my fingaz on the corner
Sell crack, cocaine & marijuana
Ski mask red rags & California

Pimp hard charging fee to all the boppers
Hundred round .223's inside the chopper
Piru piru

[Verse 2: YG]
Rich niggas still in the turf
Since 16 I've been burned
Mixed the brandy with the lemonade call it briminade
Now we turnt
On the corner on the block with no t-shirt
Driving slow gonna that'll get you merked
Caught em slipping in the turf
RIP pictures on the shirt
B-O-M-P-T-O-N
Late night niggas creepin'
The reason your momma said when the lights come on bring yo ass in
Yeah, niggas hang out
Talk extra we banged out
Trade straps then trade them back
Let the burgundy flag swang out, damn
Niggas don't want no escape plan
Niggas just wanna bird and the chopper that'll get 'em off one in his hands, damn
Bompton snapped back with my Ray-Bans
Thinking back Boo the third
Free him
He my main man
Piru

Big burgundy flag where we kill over mag

Turnin over in the grave they mad
