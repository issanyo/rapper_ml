[Intro: Wale]
They gotta feel like butter baby
Yea, hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em
Yea, hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em
Uh lets get it work

[Verse 1: Wale]
Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck it
LA women in my stable none of them are donkey
Bulimic maybe decent, said "baby you need Jesus"
Said "Ain't you Muslim Wale?" I said that ain't ya business
Go and mind it, bumpin Gold Alpinas
Rap while mix poetry quadrupled a nigga vagina
In take, take down, squad stay down
All my bitches in here that's 2-5, say "ooww"
Supercharged off that San Diego medical
And about a move contemplate on this revenue
And heaven knows what this money shit can do to you
But I ain't tryna orange suit for hoardin pharmaceutical
Elude the fame in the same breath pursue the loot
When you do your thing ya bang bitches then toodle-oo
Zanotti boots, Giuseppe's woo
She throw a fit she threw it at me I just threw the deuces

[Hook 1: Wale]
Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em
Yea, Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em
Uh lets get it, work
Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em
Yea, Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em
Uh lets get it, work

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
And I been cutting hoes off cuz I can't trust em
She switched sides on me other niggas fuckin
But I'mma bounce back like it ain't nothing
And you niggas could never see me
Talk shit but he wanna be me I don't drink Vodka-tinis
I fuck with that straight 'Gnac from here to the state cap
Wit bitches that lick sacks and niggas that shoot craps (yep)
So I don't give a fuck about a rap check (uh-huh)
Just cars and assets, rolexes with baguettes
Your bitches got bad breath, my bitches get mad pressed
Like "why you can't call me?" "damn, we just had sex" (uh)
Hella shows, hella girls, hella beats, crush em
At least hook a nigga up a English muffin
I wonder would she like me if I did construction
It's rules to the game you gotta read instructions
We can't split alimony
Just half of this macaroni have sex then we back to homies that's it

[Hook 2 (x4): Wale & Dom]
Hella flow, hella bread, hella haters fuck em
And I been cutting hoes off cuz I can't trust em

[Verse : 3 YG]
Haters fuck em, all my haters fuck em
Reason I ain't got no girlfriend cuz these bitches I can't trust em (Noo)
Police duck em, middle finger fuck em
I went from robbing to rich, I'm a scattish motherfucker
You's a mark, but that's a topic I don't wanna touch on
You the type that don't bust back when you get bust on
Get your bitch before I let her have it
If you don't wanna go to jail boy pay them taxes
Wale reached out (What Up) he a real nigga
I thought he ain't fuck wit a nigga like Tommy Hilfiger, salute
Them bitches from the club be boufed
The only reason we fuck wit em cuz we know they get loose
You got niggas ghost writin your hits
I got bitches from the Bay ghost ridin my dick
I'm so west coast, I used to be strapped on the metro
I remember asking niggas who had snaps on the petro
But now I got

[Hook 2 (x3)]
