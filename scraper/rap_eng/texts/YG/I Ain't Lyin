[Intro]
Hahaha
Bitch, I ain't lyin'
Bitch, stupid bitch
Stupid nigga

[Hook]
If you heard it in a song, bitch, I ain't lyin'
If I put it on mamas, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Yea, nigga, did some time, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Got the Rollie on, and I can't tell time, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Got a 100 racks cash, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Never paid for no ass, bitch, I ain't lyin'
220 on the dash, bitch, I ain't lyin'
I just want some ass, bitch, I ain't lyin'

[Verse 1]
I ain't lyin', my chain never hidin' (I shoot)
Why you lyin'? You ain't never slidin' (you know)
Never lie 'bout what I got
Homies never lie about who they popped
If you a opp, you a opp
All that tryna be cool at the rap show gotta stop
Always tryna slide on these niggas
Baby tryna vibe with a nigga
No time got a nine for you niggas
Got a drum with a 100 legs like a caterpillar
Been had mills in the cut
Been stuck my finger in her butt
Been lookin' for revenge
Pablo, been my friend

[Hook]
If you heard it in a song, bitch, I ain't lyin'
If I put it on mamas, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Yea, nigga, this your time, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Got the Rollie on, and I can't tell time, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Got a 100 racks cash, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Never paid for no ass, bitch, I ain't lyin'
220 on the dash, bitch, I ain't lyin'
I just want some ass, bitch, I ain't lyin'

[Verse 2]
On the low, I'm a freak nigga
But keep that on the low, bitch
On the low, you're a ho bitch
You're on that don't let nobody know shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Count so many hunnids, lost focus
My whole clique, my whole clique
Put 'em all on their feet and told 'em, "go get"
I ain't lyin', nigga, diss me 'round me plyin
See him in traffic I'm firin'
Pressure I'm applyin', please show me my alliance
I get money, I got it figured out to the science
I been soo-woopin' from the jump
Been wearin' my pants with a cuff
You been tryna act tough
Go rehearse your show and bluff

[Hook]
If you heard it in a song, bitch, I ain't lyin'
If I put it on mamas, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Yea, nigga, this your time, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Got the Rollie on, and I can't tell time, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Got a 100 racks cash, bitch, I ain't lyin'
Never paid for no ass, bitch, I ain't lyin'
220 on the dash, bitch, I ain't lyin'
I just want some ass, bitch, I ain't lyin'
