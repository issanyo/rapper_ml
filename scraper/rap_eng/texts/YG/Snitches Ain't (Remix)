Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks [x8]

[Verse 1:YG]
Aye...uh
Got this bitch named Tar, she let me fuck her in the car
Like Kim Kardashian, she wanna be a Star
Got this bitch named Brittany with big ass titties
But bitches ain't shit cause bitches act Mickey
(uuuugh)
Got a main bitch but I don't need her
Every time we fuck, I gotta pop a bean first
Hit the purp, then eat that pussy for dessert
It gets worse, just watch when she squirt
I got this bitch who act Sadity
She live in the cities
Every time she hear I got a new bitch, she says she miss me
I'm a thug, got this thug bitch, she stay up in the jungles
Every time we go to Crenshaw Mall, she have a rumble
Got this bitch in the Hoovas, I don't wanna lose her
Ass so fat to measure it, I need a rulaaa
Got this bad bitch that go to North-ridge
She always wear Gucci but she can't afford it

[Verse 2:Tyga]
Take a bitch life, Now it's my life
Need a bitch that can fuck, cook, clean, right
Turn a bitch out, make her lick twice
Yeah, she eat pussy but she don't fuck dikes
Laid in the middle, two Miller Lites
Straight kill a bitch, pop rocks little Sprite
Bam bam, little chubby ass, gooey car
Tell the bitch twinkle, twinkle, come meet a star
I don't Odom, no Lamar
Kind of money make her come out her Leotard
I'm in this bitch like my dick hard
And I shuffle money like playing cards
Uuuuuh
YG tell them bitches wassup, they ready to cut
No, links in my suit, we don't cuff 'em
Straight duck 'em, like Donald
Quack Qwock
I don't even know the sound them bitches make
Cause...

[Verse 3:2chainz]
( 2 chaiiiiins)
Old car, new broad
No penis, no broad
Your mans burnt out like a white owl [?]
White girl we the same color when the lights out!
Mean while, gut the plug on speak out
You might ear your girl voice if you hit redial
(hello)
Fuck her last night now I'm [?]
I can't ear what you saying cause my weed loud
Rubber band 'round my money
I got a rubber band 'round my money
Bitch shit, like a horse did it[?]
(daamn)
Got a Porsche just to go with it
Everything gon' go, Imma go get her[?]
One thing that I hate is a broke nigga
Second thing that I hate is a broke hoe
And the motherfucker snitching to the popo

[Verse 3:Nipsey Hussle]
Look, I like bitches, that's light-skinned
With ah whole a lot of ass, and get right with it
Off a pill, I can probably make her like bitches
Lick, lick it, like a lolli till it's like liquid
These hoochies always talking 'bout, where my dick is
But if it's not in your mouth then get out my business
A nigga real ratchet, I ain't wifing shit
Known to fuck and cut her off, light switches
Uh, now what I get? Money bitch
You look good, but to me you just a bummy bitch
And the funny shit is, you know my other bitch
Met me through her on some under cover lover shit
Goddamn, ain't that your homegirl?
Scandalous bitches, we living in a cold world
That's why I flip 'em, flip 'em like ah zone, girl
And every week I change my number to my phone
Cause...
