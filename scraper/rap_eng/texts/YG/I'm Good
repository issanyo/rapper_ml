[Chorus]
First off, this beat bang
Ask around, I'm the motherfuckin' man
I'm about to drop ten racks on a chain
And find a pretty bitch that I can dip with in the Range
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good, nigga

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, I'm so straight the cops so crooked
Clique full of soldiers like No Limit
YG, what you doing? Bitch gimme four minutes
All in a nigga grill like four dentists
Ridin' 'round solo got the money in the choke-hold
Whole head tattooed like a fucking Cholo
Never hate the next man nigga that's a no no
Got ya girl bouncing on my dick like a low low
Mustard on the beat, mustard get a fucking check
I got bitches, take bitches nigga wanna bet?
Ice on my neck got ice in my ears
Hit the club niggas looking at me hella weird
It's YG 400, bitch, get it right
You at the club every weekend? Bitch get a life
Ever since she fucked with me, she never been the same
Well, god damn, just blame it on my ding-a-lang

[Chorus]
First off, this beat bang
Ask around, I'm the motherfuckin' man
I'm about to drop ten racks on a chain
And find a pretty bitch that I can dip with in the Range
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good, nigga

[Verse 2]
I'm so froze, diamonds look so lemon
Used to text 'cause my phone had low minutes
Niggas need swishers so we at the store with it
If you don't drop on the blunt then you don't hit it
Flyer than a eagle, ridin' in a regale
Money over bitches, nigga, you don't think we know
Pockets full of c-notes, oops, I mean p-notes
Bitch in the whip looking hot like a Cheeto
Uh, Louie bag and a briefcase, bitch
I get money like a sweepstakes
Uh, every week a nigga eat steak
What's dessert? Shit, I wonder how she tastes
I don't want her, you can get her
Bitch you ugly like yo' daddy Reggie Miller
Like Pittsburgh bet I steal her
And fuck her in the whip brand new from the dealer

[Chorus]
First off, this beat bang
Ask around, I'm the motherfuckin' man
I'm about to drop ten racks on a chain
And find a pretty bitch that I can dip with in the Range
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good
I'm good, I put that on the hood, I'm good, nigga

[Outro]
I'm good on the I'm the shit!
YG 400, bitch! I'm real!
I don't dance, nigga 2 step
Nigga, trip then a shoot, nigga with the tech
Hey, motherfucker, don't you move
What...nigga...moved?
Yeah, uh huh, that's what I thought, motherfucker
Mustard on the beat, ho!
