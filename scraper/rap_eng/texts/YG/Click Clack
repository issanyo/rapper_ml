[Hook]
I got that click-clack, bang-bang, hit a nigga up
It's that young nigga, Rich Gang, we don't give a fuck
Give your bitch this dang-a-lang, she gon' give me some
Got that big AK thang, sittin' in the trunk

[Verse 1: YG]
That bitch called my phone askin' me about my other ho
If she keep pressing, I'mma fuck around and fuck her, though
Bitches, snitches and fake niggas, I don't fuck with those
Swear you niggas pussy, niggas chicken like Buffalos
Ride around in that Porsche, cops tryna blurt me, of course
Your niggas don't eat pork, my niggas don't do court
Murder, murder, murder, murder
You niggas ain't beefin' with a hamburger (it's 400!)

[Bridge]
Said my homies gettin' high (to my homies gettin' high)
Swear somebody gonna die (somebody gonna die)
I said my homies gettin' high (my homies gettin' high)
Swear somebody gonna die (somebody gonna die)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ferg]
You can find me in the Bay, and I'm riding Continental
Bumpin' Mac Dre, and he got me on my thizzle
Fill that up with lead like a motherfuckin' pencil
Bitch gon' give me head while I'm loading up my pistol
See the homie YG, rollin' down my window
Said they try and try me, what you tryna get into?
Fuckin' with the wrong one, we gon' get revenge
Fuckin' with the wrong nigga, five shots in your Benz
Fuckin' with the wrong niggas, those are not your friends
They a bunch of wearin' thong niggas, hiding behind tints
See you fuckin' with the Trap Lord, you committing sins
You gon' get what you asked for: two shots to the chest
