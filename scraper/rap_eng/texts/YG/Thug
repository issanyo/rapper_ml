[Hook: AD]
You ain't never had a thug
You ain't never had a thug
Beat it all night 'til you had enough
You ain't never had a thug
Buss it down for a cuh
Best friend said she only want a blood
You ain't never had a thug
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
You ain't never had a thug
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
You ain't never had a thug

[Verse 1: AD]
You ain't never had a thug
Tired of these lame ass niggas in the club
I ain't here to play games, I ain't lookin' for the love
Let your man date you, I'm the one to beat it up
Do it 'tll it hurts on the turf, gotta bang mine
Hit you from the back while I'm throwin' up my gang signs
Take you to the hood, let you cruise around the mainline
Hit the blunt and lick the middle at the same time
Damn, bet you never had it that way
Bring your friend, she ain't with it, send her that way
Take a loss, get it back, that's the fast way
And I can still make money on a bad day, wait a minute
Come and fuck with a thug nigga
Only hangin' round them G's and them drug dealers
Look, you need a rider, not a punk
Hit a nigga line, give it to you what he want

[Hook: AD]
You ain't never had a thug
You ain't never had a thug
Beat it all night 'til you had enough
You ain't never had a thug
Buss it down for a cuh
Best friend said she only want a blood
You ain't never had a thug
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
You ain't never had a thug
Wait, wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
You ain't never had a thug

[Verse 2: YG]
You ain't never had a Blood
Westside middle finger touch my thumb
My Crip bitch take dick like "Aww cuz"
That's my spot on the hood
I'm in there makin' pornos on the mat'
Show the next bitch like this where it's at
Have you ever took dick from the back?
Fuckin' up your tracks listenin' to Bangin' on Wax oh
Said she never had that way
Dick good call me on a bad day
And the Maybach parked on the alley
(What that mean ?)
That mean a nigga do the nasty
She want a Piru gang member
She just wanna fuck she ain't even tryna hang with you
I'm a P-phunk not a chump
My sex drive brazy, give it to you when you want

[Hook: AD]
You ain't never had a thug
You ain't never had a thug
Beat it all night 'til you had enough
You ain't never had a thug
Buss it down for a cuh
Best friend said she only want a blood
You ain't never had a thug
Wait, wait a minute (wait a minute)
Wait, wait a minute
You ain't never had a thug
Wait, wait a minute (wait a minute)
Wait, wait a minute
You ain't never had a thug

[Outro]
Come fuck with a thug nigga
Only hangin' 'round them G's and them drug dealers
Look, you need a rider, not a punk (wait a minute)
Hit a nigga line, give it you what he want
Wait, wait a minute
You ain't never had a thug
