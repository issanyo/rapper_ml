[Intro: French Montana & (Fabolous)]
You know when you hear that haaan!
Montana, remix (yeah)
Hey Snootie Wild, I gotcha (CMG, the family)
So we talkin'

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
Yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block, that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco and you niggas know so

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Shout out to my day-o, innie, yayo
That white shit put me on the bread, I should call it mayo
And my niggas go all out, I should call 'em AO
That choppa lay you down, you can't get up, I call it KO
Yeah, J.O., that's what I call jump off
Your baby momma on the dick, and she don't wanna jump off
Sucka found out, hit the roof and jumped off
It's fucked up that a jump off, made a nigga jump off
Yeah, Pablo, Griselda and Chapo
Feeling like King Pin, vacation in Cabo
Bossed up, El Fabo, no money, no hablo
Two bottle of Diablo, all I know is yayo (Niice)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
Yeah, yayo, yeah, I just say yayo
Taste just like the candy cane but whiter than that pure snow
And why you try to play me, and you know you selling wuapo?
When you with the boss, then I got to say so
Aye, oh no, hit these licks like oh no
Counting all this mula paper, you can call it mucho
Cause I be rockin' all this paper, movin' weight like macho
I be eatin' nacho, cheese, guapo
Aye, vato, holler at amigo
If he gon' get them hoes and wrap 'em tighter than burrito
I let 'em know I need them for the low, he need it pronto
He gon' ship 'em off, ptttiu! Torpedo!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I swear, ha-haaah
Yayo, yayo, all I know is yayo
It feels some type of way, our dudes know I let that K go
Couple dudes is nice, the rest of y'all just in the away tho
The coke is from Colombia, the kush is from LA tho
I get it in the mail, I got some people on the pay-roll
Let it sit they like it even better when it's a day-old
Money sure will get you shot, stabbed or K.O'd
Wheneva I say go, y'all know, they know
Extendo out the window, motherfucker, broad day-do
Devil with the pitchfork or the angel with the halo
Spanish mami with me, fat ass J-Lo
When she ask me what I do I told her all I knew is yayo

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: YG]
Aye, it's yayo on the block, when it's hot like a mu'fucka
The price drop, homies cut like a mu'fucka
The homie turned to a chef and the fiends love him
These niggas on the block selling all day
They niggas living like Penny Hardaway
Nigga bust a whole bird down sellin' ounce to ounce
For you more money, but that’s a harder way
He just got out on motherfuckin' bail
He just got a pack in the motherfuckin' mail
Push it overseas, “How it’s smell?"
Niggas like: "Ooh, that’s that Scarface!"
Ooh, this shit look sauteed, ooh it smell so tart, eh
We movin' work like Hova moved the Nets to Barclay
Oh, we them niggas, oh, we got them hittaz
Ooh, that yayo bakin' soda freein' like yo niggas"
Hold up, shh, on the phone, niggas don’t talk now
Cause niggas get in that interrogation room and they bitch out
Uh-oh!

[Verse 5: French Montana]
Yayo, yayo, all we need is yayo
Killers on the payroll, clap, you sniff some yayo
Dikeman got that yayo, Heights got that yayo
Forlter got that yayo, Broadway got that yayo
Yayo, yayo, trafficking that yayo
If they pull us over, Buju Banton with that yayo
Beaucoup with that yayo, Coo Coo with that yayo
Soda all inside, chicken noodle with that yayo
Pablo and Diego swallowin' that yayo
Flights from Republic, damn it doodoo in that yayo
My nigga down south got a plug on that yayo
Catch me up top 'bout fifty for that yayo
Haaan! Coke Boy

[Outro: Snootie Wild]
All I know is yayo
