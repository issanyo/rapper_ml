Full cuddy (cookin soul)
Good weed bad bitches

Thought him in his job found f*ck that’s a bad bitches

[Verse 2]
Okay I see where we’re going
Got some homies who be growing
Got some homies who be pimping
Got some hoes who be stripping
Used to be my girlfriend I ain’t really tripping (nah)
B*tch I’m on a mission
And I’m charging for admission
B*tch I got a vision
You ain’t with it get the stepping
I’m a mother f*cking legend
Six shots like a Western
And I hustle all day throw my gun on the counter and I turn around and say
Please take care of me
She said you’re lifestyle scary

[Chorus]
I like the way she do it she do it
You want to get into it we can do it
I like the way she do it she do it
You want to get into it we can do it

On a low down I know you want a four pound
That ain’t even go down on a low down
He ain’t want the four pound
On my room that ain’t even go down

[Verse 3]
I’m the man yeah I’m the man
Rack city b*tch we throwing bands
Hot boy buring sh*t and no fan
East Oakland California I can take it to the land
Take it hoe we sell bricks hoe
Cush game bitch you can smell it in my bones
Mount keys killing sh*t so you know he drove
I’m all gold yeah I’m all cold
You can say I’m all ice I say nice
Living the good life want war we won’t fight
Do you act Suge Knight Suge Knight
A couple young bitches one dark one white
She all white I’m all green
I tried to have her in my dreams
When she had green I need oil and beads
Stop playing before a n*gga start a scene

[Outro]
I like the way she do it she do it
You want to get into it we can do it
I like the way she do it she do it
You want to get into it we can do it
