Wait which ones make my booty look bigger ?

Can you make it clap

She drop it to the floor low then she pick it up

[Verse 1]
Booty like Nicki bitch so pretty
If I see her in the club bet a dub I get it
All the bad bitches all the rat bitches
All the doo doo mamas and the fat bitches
Gone gone gone fuck it up drink the whole cup
Leave your number baby tell me when we gone fuck
Tell her dance on my dick I can't get enough
I ain't tryna have a baby but I'm tryna bust a nut
Yeaah a nigga nasty bitch call me daddy
Now she wanna be my bitch and start a fuckin' family
What I look like ? I told that slut psych'
Baby said she pregnant, that was a joke right ?
I said it must be ya ass cause it ain't yo' face
Don't kill all of it bitch pass the drink
I'm try-na bag a bitch like I bag a eighth
Egg shell, brak her open like I brak'd the safe

[Verse 2]
Lil' bad bitch I bet I hit fo'sho
She turn me on when she start doing the toosie roll
Pulled up to the spot in the Benzo
I brought it out the lot, y'all shit a rental
Get it in the backseat, fog up the windows
The Maybach Benzo is like a limbo
Her ass poppin' like pimples
Tryna go in like some ass on dimples
Rollin' off a pill nigga real hard
Fuck with me girl I can put you on a billboard
Fat asses get passes
Tryna find a bitch who I know gettin' ratchet
She got her 7 jeans on and her weave long
She just want somebody shoulder she can lean on
Lil' naked bitch she got her crack out
Kit-Kat snack I'll blow her back out
