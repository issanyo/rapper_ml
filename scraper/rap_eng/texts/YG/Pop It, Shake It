[Verse 1: YG]
This is not just another dance sooooong
This that, "Baby did you leave ya man home?"
Kuz I'm tryna party like I'm grown
I'm tryna get the lap dance with my eyes closed, yeah
You my type, my type and I'm starving
I think you fit my appetite
Kan you live up to the hype?
I be cautious, I klean you up with the Wet Wipes
She a stripper, but she bad tho
Got back on her feet
She was doing bad though
Made it out the struggle
I respect her hustle, yeah
Fuck it, put her in a mansion, yeah
Fuck it, make sure the Rollie matching, yeah
If you an independent woman, yeah
Mercedes Benz, Celine bag
You ain't ever gotta tell her
And she know she bad

[Chorus: YG]
Let me see you, no hands
Let me see you pop it like rubber bands
Kan you make me feel like the man?
Kan you sit it all in my right hand?
Uh ohhhhhh
Pop it, shake it, pop it, shake it
Pop it, shake it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Shake it, pop it, shake it
Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, pop it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it

[Verse 2: YG]
Dammmn, yeah she moving kinda fast though (fast though)
Tryna keep up, but I don't wanna crash though (crash though)
Baby got back though
She the type you sneak out the back door
Show me what you working with, drop it down, do a split
Damn girl, you bad as shit
She a vegan, but she still thick
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, westside
G bitch, big spender, big tipper
Grab the ones, bring the liquor
Lemme rap to ya in the basement, Big Tigger
And Jay got B and I'm YG, pop that on me
Jay got B and I'm YG, girl pop that pussy on me

[Chorus: YG]
Let me see you, no hands
Let me see you pop it like rubber bands
