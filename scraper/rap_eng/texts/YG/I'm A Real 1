[Intro]
Aye, Mustard, I swear to God
I'm tired of these fake ass niggas

[Verse 1]
Smash off in that Porsche, like, "Skrr!"
My niggas smoke kush, no purp
If that puss got a bush I’m like: "No!"
Hairy pussy bitch, you the type that got herps
I’m 6-figure nigga, your account: no digits
Fuck the bitch and bust a nut in four minutes
‘Cause I ain't got time for pussy
"YG, what's yo' type?," I'm hittin' all kinds of pussy
You the type that hang with niggas you don’t like
For the fame, that’s a shame, your lifestyle is all hype
I used to drive that all-white Beamer
I had to get that Porsche, ‘cause it was cleaner
Now I’m 'bout to throw 4’s on that bitch
I’m in the party stumping, tricking falls on that bitch
And if one fight, then we all fight
Boom, bow, bing, nigga, on sight!

[Hook]
Nigga, I’m a real one
You do﻿ whatever for the fame
You make me wanna go click-clack bang
Nigga, I’m a real one
I can’t stand you niggas
I be wantin' backhand you niggas
Nigga, I’m a real one
Yep, all my niggas bangers
Watch how I twist my fingers
Nigga, I’m a real one
If one fight, then we all fight
Pop a pill and fuck all night!

[Verse 2]
Rollie on the wrist, Louis on the belt
I’m 'bout to call the IRS on myself
AMG Benzes, Porsche's on 4’s
Me and Mustard pull up, that’s a car show
Niggas getting mad, but we just getting money
I can be your boo thang, not your hubby
All the bitches love me, all the bitches love me
If I had a 100 dicks, I'd have all the bitches fuck me
New house, new whip, new year, new goal
Same nigga, same shit, same clique, same bros
Nigga, I’m a real one
If I ain't got it, then I'ma I steal one
Nigga, I never fear one
I eat the pussy on the first date
Then brush my teeth with Colgate
I'd rather spend money before I spend time
Ask Drake, he'll tell you, "No lie."

[Hook]
Nigga, I’m a real one
You do﻿ whatever for the fame
You make me wanna go click-clack bang
Nigga, I’m a real one
I can’t stand you niggas
I be wantin' backhand you niggas
Nigga, I’m a real one
Yep, all my niggas bangers
Watch how I twist my fingers
Nigga, I’m a real one
If one fight, then we all fight
Pop a pill and fuck all night!

[Bridge]
Say nigga, I’m a real one
Say nigga, I’m a real one
You ain't a real one 'til you kill one
Well, click-clack, pow, I’m a real one
Nigga, can no nigga tell me nothing 'bout me
Can no nigga tell me nothing 'bout me
Can no nigga tell me nothing 'bout me
Nah, nigga, not me

[Hook]
Nigga, I’m a real one
You do﻿ whatever for the fame
You make me wanna go click-clack bang
Nigga, I’m a real one
I can’t stand you niggas
I be wantin' backhand you niggas
Nigga, I’m a real one
Yep, all my niggas bangers
Watch how I twist my fingers
Nigga, I’m a real one
If one fight, then we all fight
Pop a pill and fuck all night!
