[Verse 1: YG]
Long story short you sprung on this
Huh?
Tried to get over me but he wasn't it
Huh?
And your home girl just went through
The same shit
Huh?
Having heart to hearts about something
You can't get
Huh?

[Verse 2: Sevyn Streeter]
Together, forever
I would never, never let you go
See now soon as we say that, we at war
Surrender, somethin' we don't know

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Something between us, certain fire in our love
Its unreleasable, unbelievable
We're miserable apart, but together it's so hard
All I need to know, ohh all I need to know

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
My ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
I need to know, whooaahooah ohh

[Verse 3: Sevyn Streeter]
Mhmm, every time we break up
We turn around and we make up
Momma wonder when I'm gon' wake up
But he love my face with no make-up
And every time I call him
We end up having a problem
And I know we'll probably never solve it
Hmmm, but damn I really love him

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Something between us, certain fire in our love
Its unreleasable, unbelievable
We're miserable apart, but together it's so hard
All I need to know, ohh all I need to know

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
My ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
I need to know, whooaahooah ohh

[Verse 4: YG]
Thirsty! But on the low I'm with the thirsties too
She a rida but I'm tryna love on you
I be tryna stay faithful but that's hard to do
Running back to that OH having dej a vu
I been here, I do this all the time
The girl right now feel like my pants is on my mind
They say think with your head and not with you woo
But real life that's the same dude
And I'm thinking and I'm thinkinh and I'm thinking
Of why I'm leaving, I can't give her 21 reasons
Except the sex with my ex is the reason why she'll
Probably be my next

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
My ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
How can my ex boyfriend be my next boyfriend?
I need to know, whooaahooah ohh
