[Verse 1: Jay 305]
I'm that nigga, same old nigga
Ain't shit changed, name getting bigga
Hoes be choosin, hoochies be rooting
Fuck is you doing? Bitch start screwing
I ain't here to play games witcha or kiss ya
Bitch youzza flipper, be on them dolphins
Since the 8th grade bitch you been tossin
They used to call you choo-choo at Dorsey
Seen her at Stars? Yeah at the back doe
In and out the club? Yeah that's that ho
Kicking it with rappers? Yeah that's that ho
Fuckin with athletes? Yeah that's that ho
Anywhere the money is, is where the pussy go

Damn shame cause the bitch she still broke

Twenty years in, you can't help but respect it

I blew that on a necklace
In the club she bounce it
Hold my buzz, she ratchet
I gon' kill the pussy, I should buy her a casket
These hoes don't want to be safe
These hoes just want to get paid
Tryna Captain Save These Hoes, I ought to hang you by your cape
Bet she got her Phd, baby girl a head doctor
Bitches flocking to my section
They gon' follow all the sparklers
Homie watch your bitch when you bring her to the club, if you love her
You know she a flip, take your bitch to my room and fuck her
Man I know these broke niggas can't stand us
So police ass nigga why don't you stop trying to handcuff
