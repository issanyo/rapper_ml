[Intro]

Where are my ladies at
Love bug, shit
Look

[Verse 1: YG]

And if you with it like I'm with it, we can get it bragging
I'm trying to get two things, some dick and satisfaction
You know we both Christian, you know we both sinning
Just ask for forgiveness after I remove that denim
With your fine ass treat you like a wine glass
Top shelf, beat that pussy up
Beat it up and do it carefully
Turn you phone off girl no one can help you
Yeuh, I'm a pussy eatin' nigga, all I do is eat pussy
Do it in your mama's house like I don't care if she looking
Get it's so good, I have her shake it
He looking, tell him she took it, uh
Put it in my mouth girl, put it in my mouth
Make you say, oh my God, girl just put it in my mouth
Yeuh, Put it in my mouth girl, put it in my mouth
This a message from the Lord girl just put it in my mouth

[Hook: TY$]

I'mma give that love Jones baby lay your head down
Don't everybody do leave it up to me and I work it out
Love Jones, Love Jones, Love Jones
Lick it one time and two time

[Verse 2: YG]

Fuck your make up, I be trying to lay up
Slang this dick so good you can't even stay up
I do it so good, make you wanna bang the hood
Yeah, I do it so good, make you wanna bang the hood
Say it's on then it's on, to make sure
I sip patron 'till it's gone
Uh, she in her T-shirt and the panties, oh whatever
Yeah, as long as they ain't grannies I do whatever
And you know I'm with the bros, so bring your home girls
We only fucking, it ain't wrong girl
I'm trying to turn the phone conversation
Into taking off your thong girl
So if you with that, let's skip get the chit chat
Get to the bizz at, make that pussy collapse
Shit, I'm a real nigga, and I know you got some situations with them other niggas
But I wanna fuck with you so I'mma deal with â€˜em

[Hook]

[Outro: YG]

And if you with it like I'm with it
We can get it bragging
I'm trying to get two things, some dick and satisfaction
You know we both christian, you know we both sinning
Just ask for forgiveness at the R rate movie dinner
