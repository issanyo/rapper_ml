[Intro: Deep voiced narrator & unknown woman]
Welcome to the party of your life
We need everybody to turn up
Let's go!
Based God

[Hook: Lil B]
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb (DJ turn up right now!)
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb (Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Where you from, scary ass nigga?
We be in the club on bitches
Niggas get rocked everyday
I be in the club with a K
I be at work with a hammer
Tryin' to invest in a ladder
Niggas out here get splattered
I don't leave the house without a hammer
Don't get shot in the face
Back door your fam broad day
Back door your kids in your face (face)
Fake ass nigga, don't play
Feeling hostile in the club
Selling our dope in the club
We don't give a fuck
Nah, we don't give a fuck

[Hook: Lil B]
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb

{Verse 2: YG]
Uh, uh
All my young niggas go brazy
Catch a body under eighteen
Held a pistol way before eighteen
And the clip held one, that's an nineteen
Fuck an if and a maybe
The bitch bad, go half on a baby
Aye, and do the bitch like I'm Chinese
Drive the bitch crazy
I make the Bloods look bool how I'm 'posed to
I make the kids wanna Blood how I'm 'posed to
Ay, I ain't never fuck with Oprah
Young nigga, Keyshia Cole on my poster
How you feel about a nigga? Fuck Bloods
How you feel about a bitch? Fuck love
Your daddy was a gangster, but so what?
Still pull up on your ass doing four months

[Hook: Lil B]
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb (Where you at? Where you at?)
All my young niggas go dumb
All my young niggas go dumb (Throw it up!)
All my young niggas go dumb (Throw it up! Throw it up!)
All my young niggas go dumb (Throw it up! Throw it up!)
All my young niggas go dumb (Throw it up! Throw it up!)

{Verse 3: Lil B]
West Berkeley that's where I'm from
Seventh street nigga, James Kennedy Park
Now a nigga rich with the digital start
South Berkeley niggas meet me at the park
Berkeley High, we get live (Where you at?)
Oakland Tech, Albany High (Where you at?)
El Cerrito, Richmond High
Throw your hood up bitch it's all right
I'll be that nigga in the club tonight
Lil B show, that's a fun night
Thank you Based God, go dumb for life (for life)
We be turnt up like a summer night (summer night)
Uh, forreal bitch
Me and my niggas on some ill shit
Cal Berkeley, we in this bitch
Cal Berkeley, we in this bitch (Hey!)

[Hook: Lil B]
All my young niggas go dumb
