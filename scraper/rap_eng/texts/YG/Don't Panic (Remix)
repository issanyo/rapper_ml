[Intro: French Montana]
Don't panic, nigga don't panic
Don't panic, nigga don't panic

[Hook: French Montana]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler
Man I took her from a buster
Niggas keep talkin' like they know something
I slide on your bitch like she on something
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Real niggas getting cake
Watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic

[Bridge: YG]
Aye, aye, aye, aye nigga where you from?
Aye, aye, aye hold up get your gun
Aye, aye, aye, aye nigga what you say?
Aye, aye nigga hold up hold up

[Verse 1: YG]
Vanilla Ice, Vanilla Ice
I take your shit like I'm Suge Knight
Spend a little money, get your mind right
I fucked your bitch, that's a highlight
I'm strapped up, you're damn right
Tryna rob me, cops pickin' up them shells like
I'm like I was overseas all summer
Now my foreign car matching foreign numbers
Bitches wanna fuck me cause a nigga status
Bitches come and go, you ever see magic?
Seen a nigga I don't like, he was non-active
I was fifty niggas deep, I told them

[Hook: French Montana]
Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Real niggas getting cake
Watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic
We just getting started nigga don't panic

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Talking fish scales like a whole salmon
See you fuck niggas from four planets
Just getting started nigga don't panic
If you a star, I'm a whole planet
Acting like she won't get it
Have her run through the team like Jerome Bettis
You don't want it, don't look for it
Have your bitch on a surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
If you want this money, gotta work for it
Puff puff pass, what you lookin' at?
Bust it wide open, make it nasty

[Hook: French Montana]

I won’t let up
Sippin’ that Ciroc amaretto
Real bitches gon’ wait on me
Fake bitches gon’ skate on me
Real bitches getting cake
Fake bitches gon’ hate
She a model on the Gram
Getting swallowed was the plan
This young thug need four bitches
Take her to the crib take no pictures
Ass fat, let me get up on it
Bounce back early in the morning
