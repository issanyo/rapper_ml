[Hook: YG]
It's been a long time, a time I shouldn't left you
Without a Mustard beat to step to
Flex to, let loose, finesse to
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, bang your set too
It's been a long time, a time I shouldn't left you
Without a Mustard beat to step to
Flex to, let loose, finesse to
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, bang your set too

[Verse 1: YG]
Aw damn, no they didn't
Three Musketeers back together and they winning
And they getting too much money
Them turnt niggas rich then the crew must love me
4Hunnid chain by the tummy
Skinny jeans, thing hang by the tummy
Don't underestimate me buddy
This 4 pound bark I had to tell it hush puppy
You chasing ghosts like Pac-Man
We chasing being rich ass black men
I got dough but I gotta keep this dough coming
I don't rock designer, I design 4Hunnid
I must be an entrepreneur or something
Gotta fuck your bitch, playing, always tryna pursue something
Me and Ty was bool, me and Mustard fell off
But now we picking up where we left off

[Hook: YG]
It's been a long time, a time I shouldn't left you
Without a Mustard beat to step to
Flex to, let loose, finesse to
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, bang your set too
It's been a long time, a time I shouldn't left you
Without a Mustard beat to step to
Flex to, let loose, finesse to
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, bang your set too

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Aw shit, yeah they did
3 of Amerikaz most wanted
The one that got the West back started
That bullshit we back on it, ayy
I was out getting it
I was up late night always trying to stare
Always seen the big picture
Always ten toes, stomp down like a real nigga (oh ya)
Had to make my own rules
Had to set examples for my young bools
Sucka nigga do when he can
Rich nigga do what he want to
Been a long time since you seen us
Well nigga this the re-up
Bad bitch in the Lamb with her feet up
Tell my nigga Mustard keep the beat up

[Hook: YG]
It's been a long time, a time I shouldn't left you
Without a Mustard beat to step to
Flex to, let loose, finesse to
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, bang your set too
It's been a long time, a time I shouldn't left you
Without a Mustard beat to step to
Flex to, let loose, finesse to
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, bang your set too
