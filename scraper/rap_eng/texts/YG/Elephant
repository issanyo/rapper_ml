[Intro]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, woo
Woah, oh

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Beatles, Elvis, Jackson, I'm a king in this hoe
Rest in peace, Martin Luther had had a dream in this hoe
And what happened is that elephant grew big as a bitch
And that motherfucker said, "Take a sniff, you the shit"
White girl with a fat ass and a rap game, I know I make you mad
Vacays on a private plane for my own scene I hit Trinidad
I know you probably hope I'm doin' bad
I know you probably think I'm over-privileged with a rich dad
Put a check down and get my new pad, but that's too bad
'Cause I did this shit on my own, yeah
I had to pick up the phone, yeah
Make calls, leave home, yeah
Take falls, get grown, yeah
Play records for a whole lot of people
Who just couldn't see me go for it
Kept runnin' like go Forrest
I got the awards to show for it
But they still don't believe me
And they think this life is easy
Made it far without suckin' dick
Blinde girl, no pink head
Why these people all despise me?
Yet these dudes wanna wife me
I must be doing somethin' right, please
Back the fuck up, you lil' side piece, peace

[Chorus]
I hope they see this elephant
[?] like you, this irrelevant
[??] excellent
[I hope they see this elephant
[?] like you, this irrelevant
[??] excellent
I hope they see this elephant
[?] like you, this irrelevant
I hope they see this elephant

[Verse 2: YG]
(Four hunnid)
Ayy, ayy, look
I need to Grammy after my nomination
Ayy, ayy, look
Better turn this verse to a conversation
I got a question, is it politics or is someone racist?
Y'all one YG speak nah, nah, nah, nah that nigga brazy
Nah, nah these niggas brazy
They don't talk about the gun shots
They don't talk about the deals I got
Birds I popped, the what not
Oh, I can't spit about the block?
What, I gotta turn punk rock?
Oh, oh, I get it, they wanna see a mosh pit when the beat drop
I don't need a chick to make me pop
I just need my breakfast hot
Whether you's a show up or not
I'd rather slide my own drop
Record game fucked up
Rappers turned pop, that's why they don't speak up
I spent my last hunnid on ten of your albums
Now tell me why the fuck you leadin' us
Speak up, speak up, speak up

[Refrain: Iggy Azalea & YG]
I'm just a girl who loves stacks (Oh)
Don't want no problems, don't want no problems (Oh)
You wanna know me? Come and ask me for your collar
For your collar (Oh)
Speak up, speak up, speak up
Speak up, speak up, speak up

[Chorus]
I hope they see this elephant
[?] like you, this irrelevant
[??] excellent
[I hope they see this elephant
[?] like you, this irrelevant
[??] excellent
I hope they see this elephant
[?] like you, this irrelevant
I hope they see this elephant

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
You can't deny it, I'm here, will never let go
Unless I'm buyin' a Phantom, will never get ghost
Chordz and Stix you my brothers, you know the DRUGS code
Fuck it if it's pop this year, then raps gettin' grown
How the fuck can you complain about evolution?
When most rappers spittin' trash called the rap pollution?
You can call them what you want, see this is a movement
Game change, know a better bitch, introduce me, the elephant
Uh, I'm standin' right here and you see me, the elephant
