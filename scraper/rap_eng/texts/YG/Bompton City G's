[Verse 1: Slim 400]
I'm on some stay to myself shit, If I don't like you then fuck it
Niggas know what it is in the bity, we don't trust 'em
Niggas hanging with the squad for what, for what?
Cuz we on, popping Bottles, fucking bitches every night
I remember they ain't like thugs, down talk thugs
Sneak diss thugs, nows I fuck with this treetop
On some snake shit, Slim 4 Hunnid then Blank quit
Talking Black out, do my dougie and smash out
[?] bitching over bitches that ain't gangsta nigga
I Beat at the same niggas, nigga gangsta nigga
Niggas know me, preach to the Pontiac
Back to Caprice, I've Been in the set for a minute Blood so holla at me!
I'm 400 and I ain't changin' I'm just gettin' this money
And watching weird niggas on the squad and acting funny
I ain't playing no games this gun make you state your name
I'm an original youngin' [?] spruce gang

[Verse 2: Slim 400]
And you snitching, you get dealt with
Some niggas in the hood they gotta come in at some mommas
This that gang-bang throw your hood up red as the rag shit
Know what you signed up for, 400 popping bitch
Niggas don't want no war, they ain't killin' shit
Talkin' good when they traffic, I ain't doin' shit
This 9 gon' talk back, dead-ass shit
(And I been about my business since the day that I met you)
Niggas jumpin' niggas, 1 on 1 can't see a nigga
But I'm down with that, next time you see me clap nigga
In the hood nigga, niggas know what it is
I'm a westside real one, niggas know what it is
