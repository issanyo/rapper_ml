[Verse 1]
Uh, tell 'em where I'm from
Finger on the pump, make the 6 straight jump from SoCal
Hollywood to the slums
Chronic smoke get burnt by the California sun
On the west side, east coast where you at?
Just got to New York like a net on a jet
To London, to Brazil, to Quebec
Like the whole damn world took effect to Ferg
Tell 'em

[Pre-Hook 1]
Laid back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
So lay back, slow down
Whatchu represent when we come to your town
Say, get in with the business
I'ma be there in a minute
I just booked a Paris ticket
Thinking Russia need a visit
I'ma run it to the limit
And be on my way to Venice

Everything fat
Got Mustard on a track

To London, Jamaica, then France
The whole damn world took effect to Ferg

Where you from? I'm from west side California baby
Brought her and fucked in our backyard, the minute it ain't hard
My mama be like "YG you so brazy"
Have you ever seen a gangsta nigga make a billion dollars?
Dre did it, he from L.A so pop yo collar
The LAPD be all over me
Tryin' to ban me from my own bity
But for no reason the cops just kill me
Home of the Rodney King riots this shit been wild
I hit the club and party like I scored a touchdown
I pop a bottle and all the models wanna fuck now
We jammin' on Pico, bustin' hoes on Sunset
I could take you to Venice Beach and watch the sun set
Or I could take you to the Blippers game, court seat, floor side
Eatin' on Roscoe's chicken wings
